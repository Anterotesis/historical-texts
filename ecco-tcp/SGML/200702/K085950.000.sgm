<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE and WRITINGS OF Mr. GRAY.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION THE FIRST.</HEAD>
<P>THE lives of men of letters &s;eldom abound with inci|dents; and perhaps no life ever afforded fewer than that which I have undertaken to write. But I am far from mentioning this by way of previous apology, as is the trite cu&s;tom of biographers. The re&s;pect which I owe to my decea&s;ed friend, to the public, (and let me add) to my&s;elf, prompts me to wave &s;o impertinent a ceremonial. A reader of &s;en&s;e and ta&s;te never expects to find in the memoirs of a Phi|lo&s;opher, or Poet, the &s;ame &s;pecies of entertainment, or infor|mation, which he would receive from tho&s;e of a State&s;man or General: He expects, however, to be either informed or enter|tained:
<PB N="2" REF="5">
Nor would he be di&s;appointed, did the writer take care to dwell principally on &s;uch topics as characterize the man, and di&s;tingui&s;h that peculiar part which he acted in the varied Drama of Society. But this rule, &s;elf-evidently right as it may &s;eem, is &s;eldom ob&s;erved. It was &s;aid, with almo&s;t as much truth as wit, of one of the&s;e writers, that, when he compo&s;ed the life of Lord Verulam, he forgot that he was a Philo&s;opher; and therefore, it was to be feared, &s;hould he fini&s;h that of the Duke of Marlborough, he would forget that he was a General. I &s;hall avoid a like fault. I will promi&s;e my reader that he &s;hall, in the following pages, &s;eldom behold Mr. Gray in any other light than that of a Scholar and a Poet: And though I am more &s;olicitous to &s;hew that he was a virtuous, a friendly, and an amiable man, than either; yet this &s;olicitude becomes unnece&s;&s;ary from the very papers which he has bequeathed me, and which I here arrange for the pur|po&s;e: Since in the&s;e the qualities of his head and heart &s;o con&s;tantly appear together, and the fertility of his fancy &s;o in|timately unites with the &s;ympathetic tenderne&s;s of his &s;oul, that were it in my intention, I &s;hould find it impo&s;&s;ible to disjoin them.</P>
<P>His parents were reputable citizens of London. His grand|father a con&s;iderable merchant: But his father, Mr. Philip Gray, though he al&s;o followed bu&s;ine&s;s, was of an indolent and re&s;erved temper; and therefore rather dimini&s;hed than in|crea&s;ed his paternal fortune. He had many children, of whom Thomas, the &s;ubject of the&s;e memoirs, was the fifth born. All of them, except him, died in their infancy; and I have been told that he narrowly e&s;caped &s;uffocation, (owing to too
<PB N="3" REF="6">
great a fullne&s;s of blood which de&s;troyed the re&s;t) and would certainly have been cut off as early, had not his mother, with a courage remarkable for one of her &s;ex, and withal &s;o very tender a parent, ventured to open a vein with her own hand, which in&s;tantly removed the paroxy&s;m.</P>
<P>He was born in Cornhill, December the 26th, 1716; was educated at Eton &s;chool, under the care of Mr. Antrobus, his mother's brother, who was at that time one of the a&s;&s;i&s;tant ma&s;ters. From thence he removed to St. Peter's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted a pen&s;ioner in the year 1734. While at &s;chool, he contracted a friend&s;hip with Mr. Horace Walpole and Mr. Richard We&s;t: The former of the&s;e appears, at pre&s;ent, with too much di&s;tinction in the literary, as well as fa&s;hionable world, to make it nece&s;|&s;ary I &s;hould enlarge upon his &s;ubject: But as the latter died before he could exert his uncommon abilities, it &s;eems requi|&s;ite to premi&s;e &s;omewhat concerning him; e&s;pecially as al|mo&s;t every anecdote which I have to produce, concerning the juvenile part of Mr. Gray's life, is included in his corre|&s;pondence with this gentleman. A corre&s;pondence which con|tinued, with very little interruption, for the &s;pace of about eight years, from the time of their leaving &s;chool to the death of the accompli&s;hed youth in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>His father was Lord Chancellor of Ireland. His grandfather, by the mother, the famous Bi&s;hop Burnet. He removed from Eton to Oxford, about the &s;ame time that Mr. Gray left that place for Cambridge. Each of them carried with him the repu|tation of an excellent cla&s;&s;ic &s;cholar; though I have been told
<PB N="4" REF="7">
that, at the time, Mr. We&s;t's genius was reckoned the more bril|liant of the two: A judgment which, I conceive, was not well founded; for though Mr. We&s;t's part of that corre&s;pondence, which I &s;hall &s;peedily give the reader,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I am well aware that I am here going to do a thing which the cautious and courtly Dr. Sprat (were he now alive) would highly cen&s;ure. He had, it &s;eems, a large collection of his friend Mr. Cowley's letters, <Q REND="inline">"a way of writing in which he peculiarly excelled, as in the&s;e he always expre&s;t the native tenderne&s;s and innocent gaiety of his heart; yet the Doctor was of opinion that nothing of this nature &s;hould be publi&s;hed, and that the letters that pa&s;s between particu|lar friends (if they are written as they ought to be) can &s;carce ever be fit to &s;ee the light."</Q> What! not when they expre&s;s the native tenderne&s;s and innocent gaiety of a heart like Mr. Cowley's? No, by no means, <Q REND="inline">"for in &s;uch letters the &s;ouls of men appear undre&s;t, and in that negligent habit they may be fit to be &s;een by one or two in a chamber, but not to go abroad in the &s;treet."</Q> <BIBL><HI>See Life of Cowley, page</HI> 38, <HI>Hurd's Edition.</HI></BIBL></P>
<P>Such readers as believe it incumbent on every well-bred &s;oul never to appear but in full dre&s;s, will think that Dr. Sprat has rea&s;on on his &s;ide; but I &s;u&s;pect that the generality will, notwith&s;tanding, wi&s;h he had been le&s;s &s;crupulou&s;ly deli|cate, and lament that the letters in que&s;tion are not now extant. Of one thing I am fully confident that, had this been the ca&s;e, the judicious Dr. Hurd would have found his critical labour much le&s;&s;ened, when, in pure charity to this amiable writer, he lately employed him&s;elf in &s;eparating</P>
<P>His plea&s;ing moral from his pointed wit.</P></NOTE> will undoubtedly &s;hew that he po&s;&s;e&s;t very extraordinary talents, yet, on Mr. Gray's &s;ide, there &s;eems &s;uperadded to the&s;e, &s;uch a manly preci&s;ion of ta&s;te, and maturity of judgment, as would induce one to believe Mr. Walpole's phra&s;e not very hyperbolical, who has often a&s;&s;erted to me that, <Q REND="inline">"Gray never was a Boy."</Q></P>
<P>In April, 1738, Mr. We&s;t left Chri&s;t Church for the In|ner Temple, and Mr. Gray removed from Peter-Hou&s;e to
<PB N="5" REF="8">
Town the latter end of that year; intending al&s;o to apply him|&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the Law in the &s;ame &s;ociety: For which purpo&s;e his father had already either hired or bought him a &s;et of chambers. But on an invitation which Mr. Walpole gave him to be his companion in his travels, this intention was laid a&s;ide for the pre&s;ent, and never after put in execution.</P>
<P>According to the plan which I have formed for arranging the&s;e papers, a part of the letters which I have already mentioned will here find their proper place. They will give a much clearer idea both of Mr. Gray and his friend, at this early period, than any narrative of mine. They will include al&s;o &s;everal &s;peci|mens of their juvenile compo&s;itions, and, at the &s;ame time, mark the progre&s;s they had made in literature. They will a&s;certain, not only the &s;cope and turn of their genius, but of their temper. In a word, Mr. Gray will become his own biographer, both in this and the re&s;t of the &s;ections into which I divide this work. By which means, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a few notes which I &s;hall occa&s;ionally add, it may be hoped that nothing will be omitted which may tend to give a regular and clear delineation of his life and character.</P>
<P>But as this is the earlie&s;t part of their corre&s;pondence, and includes only the time which pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Gray's ad|mi&s;&s;ion into the univer&s;ity and his going abroad, it may be rea|&s;onably expected that the manner rather than the matter of the&s;e letters mu&s;t con&s;titute their principal merit; they will therefore be chiefly acceptable to &s;uch ingenuous youths, who, being about the &s;ame age, have a reli&s;h for the &s;ame &s;tudies, and bo&s;oms &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;ame warmth of friend&s;hip. To
<PB N="6" REF="9">
the&s;e I addre&s;s them; in the plea&s;ing hope that they may prompt them to emulate their elegant &s;implicity, and, of cour&s;e, to &s;tudy with more care the cla&s;&s;ic models from which it was derived. If they do this, I &s;hall not be much concerned if graver readers think them unimportant or even trifling.</P>

<P>YOU u&s;e me very cruelly: You have &s;ent me but one letter &s;ince I have been at Oxford, and that too agree|able not to make me &s;en&s;ible how great my lo&s;s is in not having more. Next to &s;eeing you is the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing your hand-writing; next to hearing you is the plea&s;ure of hearing from you.

<P>PERMIT me again to write to you, though I have &s;o long neglected my duty, and forgive my brevity, when I tell you it is occa&s;ioned wholly by the hurry I am in to get to a place where I expect to meet with no other plea&s;ure than the &s;ight of you; for I am preparing for London in a few days at furthe&s;t. I do not wonder in the lea&s;t at your frequent bla|ming my indolence, it ought rather to be called ingratitude, and I am obliged to your goodne&s;s for &s;oftening &s;o har&s;h an ap|pellation. When we meet it will, however, be my greate&s;t of plea&s;ures to know what you do, what you read, and how you &s;pend your time, &amp;c. &amp;c. and to tell you what I do not read, and how I do not, &amp;c. for almo&s;t all the employment of my hours may be be&s;t explained by negatives; take my word and experience upon it, doing nothing is a mo&s;t amu&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s;
<PB N="8" REF="11">
and yet neither &s;omething nor nothing gives me any plea&s;ure. When you have &s;een one of my days, you have &s;een a whole year of my life; they go round and round like the blind hor&s;e in the mill, only he has the &s;atisfaction of fancying he makes a progre&s;s, and gets &s;ome ground; my eyes are open enough to &s;ee the &s;ame dull pro&s;pect, and to know that having made four|and-twenty &s;teps more, I &s;hall be ju&s;t where I was; I may, bet|ter than mo&s;t people, &s;ay my life is but a &s;pan, were I not afraid le&s;t you &s;hould not believe that a per&s;on &s;o &s;hort-lived could write even &s;o long a letter as this; in &s;hort, I believe I mu&s;t not &s;end you the hi&s;tory of my own time, till I can &s;end you that al&s;o of the reformation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carrying on the allu&s;ion to the other hi&s;tory written by Mr. We&s;t's grandfather.</NOTE> However, as the mo&s;t unde&s;erving people in the world mu&s;t &s;ure have the vanity to wi&s;h &s;omebody had a regard for them, &s;o I need not wonder at my own, in being plea&s;ed that you care about me. You need not doubt, therefore, of having a fir&s;t row in the front box of my little heart, and I believe you are not in danger of being crouded there; it is a&s;king you to an old play, indeed, but you will be candid enough to excu&s;e the whole piece for the &s;ake of a few tolerable lines.</P>
<P>For this little while pa&s;t I have been playing with Statius; we ye&s;terday had a game at quoits together; you will ea&s;ily forgive me for having broke his head, as you have a little pique to him.

<P>I Agree with you that you have broke Statius's head, but it is in like manner as Apollo broke Hyacinth's, you have foiled him infinitely at his own weapon; I mu&s;t in|&s;i&s;t on &s;eeing the re&s;t of your tran&s;lation, and then I will exa|mine it entire, and compare it with the latin, and be very wi&s;e and &s;evere, and put on an inflexible face, &s;uch as becomes the character of a true &s;on of Ari&s;tarchus, of hyper-critical me|mory.

Every per&s;on, who feels him&s;elf a poet, ought to be above pro&s;tituting his powers on &s;uch occa&s;ions, and extreme youth (as was the ca&s;e with Mr. Gray) is the only thing that can apologize for having done it.</NOTE> I was told was the be&s;t in

the Cambridge Collection before I &s;aw it, and, indeed, it is no great compliment to tell you I thought it &s;o when I had &s;een it, but &s;incerely it plea&s;ed me be&s;t. Methinks the college bards have run into a &s;trange ta&s;te on this occa&s;ion. Such &s;oft unmeaning &s;tuff about Venus and Cupid, and Peleus and The|tis, and Zephyrs and Dryads, was never read. As for my poor little Eclogue it has been condemned and beheaded by our We&s;tmin&s;ter judges; an exordium of about &s;ixteen lines ab&s;o|lutely cut off, and its other limbs quartered in a mo&s;t barba|rous manner.

<P>The following letter &s;eems to require &s;ome little preface, not &s;o much becau&s;e it expre&s;&s;es Mr. Gray's juvenile &s;entiments con|cerning the mode of our academical education, as that the&s;e &s;en|timents
<PB N="12" REF="15">
prevailed with him through life, and that he often de|clared them, with &s;o little re&s;erve, as to create him many enemies. It is certain that at the time when he was admit|ted, and for &s;ome years after, Jacobiti&s;m, and its concomitant hard drinking, prevailed &s;till at Cambridge, much to the pre|judice not only of good manners but of good letters; for, if this &s;pirit was then on the decline, it was not extingui&s;hed till after the year 1745. But we &s;ee (as was natural enough in a young man) he laid the blame rather on the mode of education than the mode of the times; and to this error, the uncommon pro|ficiency he had made at Eton in cla&s;&s;ical learning might contri|bute, as he found him&s;elf in a &s;ituation where that &s;pecies of merit held not the fir&s;t rank. However this be, it was nece&s;&s;ary not to omit this feature of his mind, when employed in draw|ing a general likene&s;s of it, and what colours could be found &s;o forcible as his own to expre&s;s its true light and &s;hadow? I would further ob&s;erve, that whatever truth there might be in his &s;atire at the time it was written, it can by no means affect the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the univer&s;ity. There is u&s;ually a much greater fluctuation of ta&s;te and manners in an academical, than a national body; occa&s;ioned (to u&s;e a &s;chola&s;tic metaphor) by that very quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of its component parts, which often goes near to de&s;troy its per&s;onal identity. Whatever therefore may be true of &s;uch a &s;ociety at one time, may be, and generally is, ten years after ab&s;olutely fal&s;e.</P>

great one to me. I have endured lectures daily and hourly &s;ince I came la&s;t, &s;upported by the hopes of being &s;hortly at full liber|ty to give my&s;elf up to my friends and cla&s;&s;ical companions, who, poor &s;ouls! though I &s;ee them fallen into great contempt with mo&s;t people here, yet I cannot help &s;ticking to them, and out of a &s;pirit of ob&s;tinacy (I think) love them the better for it; and indeed, what can I do el&s;e? Mu&s;t I plunge into metaphy&s;ics? Alas, I cannot &s;ee in the dark; nature has not furni&s;hed me with the optics of a cat. Mu&s;t I pore upon mathematics? Alas, I cannot &s;ee in too much light; I am no eagle.

<P>Mr. Gray, on his return to Town, continued at his father's hou&s;e in Cornhill till the March following, in which inter|val Mr. Walpole being di&s;inclined to enter &s;o early into the bu|&s;ine&s;s of Parliament, prevailed on Sir Robert Walpole to permit him to go abroad, and on Mr. Gray (as was &s;aid before) to be the companion of his travels. Mr. We&s;t &s;pent the greate&s;t part of the winter with his mother and &s;i&s;ter at Ep&s;om, during which time a letter or two more pa&s;&s;ed between the two friends. But the&s;e I think it unnece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert, as I have already given &s;ufficient &s;pecimens of the blo&s;&s;oms of their Genius. The Reader of ta&s;te and candour will, I tru&s;t, con&s;ider them only as &s;uch; yet will be led to think that, as the one produced afterwards <Q REND="inline">"fruits worthy of paradi&s;e,"</Q> the other, had he lived longer, would al&s;o have produced them.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION THE SECOND.</HEAD>
<P>AS I allot this Section entirely to that part of Mr. Gray's life, which he &s;pent in travelling through France and Italy, my province will be chiefly that of an Editor; and my only care to &s;elect, from a large collection of letters written to his parents and to his friend Mr. We&s;t, tho&s;e parts which, I imagine, will be mo&s;t likely either to inform or amu&s;e the reader. The multiplicity of accounts, publi&s;hed, both before and after the time when the&s;e letters were written, of tho&s;e very places which Mr. Gray de&s;cribes, will nece&s;&s;arily take from them much of their novelty; yet the elegant ea&s;e of his epi&s;tolary &s;tyle has a charm in it for all readers of true ta&s;te, that will make every apology of this &s;ort needle&s;s. They will per|ceive, that as the&s;e letters were written without even the mo&s;t di&s;tant view of publication, they are e&s;&s;entially different in their manner of de&s;cription from any other that have either preceded or followed them; add to this, that they are inter&s;per&s;ed occa|&s;ionally with &s;ome exqui&s;itely fini&s;hed pieces of Latin poetry, which he compo&s;ed on the &s;pot for the entertainment of his friend. But not to anticipate any part of the reader's plea&s;ure, I &s;hall only further &s;ay, to forewarn him of a di&s;appointment, that this corre&s;pondence is defective towards the end, and in|cludes no de&s;cription either of Venice or its territory; the la&s;t places which Mr. Gray vi&s;ited. This defect was occa&s;ioned by an unfortunate di&s;agreement between him and Mr. Walpole,
<PB N="41" REF="44">
ari&s;ing from the difference of their tempers. The former being, from his earlie&s;t years, curious, pen&s;ive, and philo&s;ophi|cal; the latter gay, lively, and, con&s;equently, incon&s;iderate: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In ju&s;tice to the memory of &s;o re&s;pectable a friend, Mr. Walpole enjoins me to charge him with the chief blame in their quarrel; confe&s;&s;ing that more atten|tion, complai&s;ance, and deference to a warm friend&s;hip, and &s;uperior judgment and prudence, might have prevented a rupture that gave much unea&s;ine&s;s to them both, and a la&s;ting concern to the &s;urvivor; though in the Year 1744 a reconci|liation was effected between them, by a Lady who wi&s;hed well to both parties.</NOTE> this therefore occa&s;ioned their &s;eparation at Reggio. Mr. Gray went before him to Venice; and &s;taying there only till he could find means of returning to England, he made the be&s;t of his way home, repa&s;&s;ing the Alps, and following almo&s;t the &s;ame route through France by which he had before gone to Italy.</P>

<P>AS we made but a very &s;hort journey to-day, and came to our inn early, I &s;it down to give you &s;ome account of our expedition. On the 29th (according to the &s;tyle here) we left Dover at twelve at noon, and with a pretty bri&s;k gale, which plea&s;ed every body mighty well, except my&s;elf who was extremely &s;ick the whole time; we reached Calais by five: The weather changed, and it began to &s;now hard the minute we came into the harbour, where we took the boat, and &s;oon landed. Calais is an exceeding old, but very pretty town, and
<PB N="42" REF="45">
we hardly &s;aw any thing there that was not &s;o new and &s;o different from England, that it &s;urprized us agreeably. We went the next morning to the great Church, and were at high Ma&s;s (it being Ea&s;ter Monday). We &s;aw al&s;o the Convent of the Capuchins, and the Nuns of St. Dominic; with the&s;e la&s;t we held much conver&s;ation, e&s;pecially with an Engli&s;h Nun, a Mrs. Davis, of who&s;e work I &s;ent you, by the return of the Pacquet, a letter-ca&s;e to remember her by. In the after|noon we took a Po&s;t-chai&s;e (it &s;till &s;nowing very hard) for Boulogne, which was only eighteen miles further. This chai&s;e is a &s;trange &s;ort of conveyance, of much greater u&s;e than beauty, re&s;embling an ill-&s;haped chariot, only with the door opening before in&s;tead of the &s;ide; three hor&s;es draw it, one between the &s;hafts, and the other two on each &s;ide, on one of which the po&s;tillion rides, and drives too:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was before the introduction of Po&s;t-chai&s;es here, el&s;e it would not have appeared a circum&s;tance worthy notice.</NOTE> This vehicle will, upon occa&s;ion, go four&s;core miles a-day, but Mr. Walpole, being in no hurry, choo&s;es to make ea&s;y jour|neys of it, and they are ea&s;y ones indeed; for the motion is much like that of a &s;edan, we go about &s;ix miles an hour, and commonly change hor&s;es at the end of it: It is true they are no very graceful &s;teeds, but they go well, and through roads which they &s;ay are bad for France, but to me they &s;eem gravel walks and bowling-greens; in &s;hort it would be the fine&s;t tra|velling in the world, were it not for the inns, which are mo&s;tly terrible places indeed. But to de&s;cribe our progre&s;s &s;omewhat more regularly, we came into Boulogne when it was almo&s;t dark, and went out pretty early on Tue&s;day morning; &s;o that all I can &s;ay about it is, that it is a large, old, fortified town,
<PB N="43" REF="46">
with more Engli&s;h in it than French. On Tue&s;day we were to go to Abb&eacute;ville, &s;eventeen leagues, or fifty-one &s;hort Engli&s;h miles; but by the way we dined at Montreuil, much to our hearts' content, on &s;tinking mutton cutlets, addle eggs, and ditch water. Madame the ho&s;te&s;s made her appearance in long lappets of bone lace and a &s;ack of lin&s;ey-wool&s;ey. We &s;upped and lodged pretty well at Abb&eacute;ville, and had time to &s;ee a little of it before we came out this morning. There are &s;eventeen convents in it, out of which we &s;aw the chapels of the Minims and the Carmelite Nuns. We are now come further thirty miles to Amiens, the chief city of the province of Picardy. We have &s;een the cathedral, which is ju&s;t what that of Can|terbury mu&s;t have been before the reformation. It is about the &s;ame &s;ize, a huge Gothic building, be&s;et on the out&s;ide with thou&s;ands of &s;mall &s;tatues, and within adorned with beau|tiful painted windows, and a va&s;t number of chapels dre&s;&s;ed out in all their finery of altar-pieces, embroidery, gilding, and marble. Over the high altar is pre&s;erved, in a very large wrought &s;hrine of ma&s;&s;y gold, the reliques of St. Firmin, their patron &s;aint. We went al&s;o to the chapels of the Je&s;uits and Ur&s;uline Nuns, the latter of which is very richly adorned. To|morrow we &s;hall lie at Clermont, and next day reach Paris. The country we have pa&s;&s;ed through hitherto has been flat, open, but agreeably diver&s;ified with villages, fields well-culti|vated, and little rivers. On every hillock is a wind-mill, a crucifix, or a Virgin Mary dre&s;&s;ed in Flowers, and a &s;arcenet robe; one &s;ees many people or carriages on the road; now and then indeed you meet a &s;trolling friar, a country-man with his great muff, or a woman riding a&s;tride on a little a&s;s, with &s;hort petticoats, and a great head-dre&s;s of blue wool. ***</P>

<P>ENFIN donc me voici &agrave; Paris. Mr. Walpole is gone out to &s;upper at Lord Conway's, and here I remain alone, though invited too. Do not think I make a merit of writing to you preferably to a good &s;upper; for the&s;e three days we have been here, have actually given me an aver&s;ion to eating in general. If hunger be the be&s;t &s;auce to meat, the French are certainly the wor&s;t cooks in the world; for what tables we have &s;een have been &s;o delicately &s;erved, and &s;o profu&s;ely, that, after ri&s;ing from one of them, one imagines it impo&s;&s;ible ever to eat again. And now, if I tell you all I have in my head, you will believe me mad, mais n'importe, courage, allons! for if I wait till my head grow clear and &s;ettle a little, you may &s;tay long enough for a letter. Six days have we been coming hither, which other people do in two; they have not been di&s;agree|able ones; through a fine, open country, admirable roads, and in an ea&s;y conveyance; the inns not ab&s;olutely intolerable, and images quite unu&s;ual pre&s;enting them&s;elves on all hands. At Amiens we &s;aw the fine cathedral, and eat pat&eacute; des perdrix; pa&s;&s;ed through the park of Chantilly by the Duke of Bourbon's palace, which we only beheld as we pa&s;&s;ed; broke down at Lu&s;arch; &s;topt at St. Denis, &s;aw all the beautiful monuments of the Kings of France, and the va&s;t trea&s;ures of the abbey, rubies, and emeralds as big as &s;mall eggs, crucifixes, and vows, crowns and reliquaries, of ine&s;timable value; but of all their curio&s;ities the thing the mo&s;t to our ta&s;tes, and which they in|deed
<PB N="45" REF="48">
do the ju&s;tice to e&s;teem the glory of their collection, was a va&s;e of an entire onyx, mea&s;uring at lea&s;t five inches over, three deep, and of great thickne&s;s. It is at lea&s;t two thou|&s;and years old, the beauty of the &s;tone and &s;culpture upon it (repre&s;enting the my&s;teries of Bacchus) beyond expre&s;&s;ion ad|mirable; we have dreamed of it ever &s;ince. The jolly old Be|nedictine, that &s;howed us the trea&s;ures, had in his youth been ten years a &s;oldier; he laughed at all the reliques, was very full of &s;tories, and mighty obliging. On Saturday Evening we got to Paris, and were driving through the &s;treets a long while be|fore we knew where we were. The minute we came, voila Milors Holderne&s;&s;e, Conway, and his brother; all &s;tayed &s;upper, and till two o'clock in the morning, for here nobody ever &s;leeps; it is not the way: Next day go to dine at my Lord Holder|ne&s;&s;e's, there was the Abb&eacute; Prev&ocirc;t, author of the Cleveland, and &s;everal other pieces much e&s;teemed; the re&s;t were Engli&s;h. At night we went to the Pandore; a &s;pect&aacute;cle literally, for it is nothing but a beautiful piece of machinery of three &s;cenes. The fir&s;t repre&s;ents the chaos, and by degrees the &s;eparation of the elements. The &s;econd, the temple of Jupiter, and the giving of the box to Pandora. The third, the opening of the box, and all the mi&s;chiefs that en&s;ued. An ab&s;urd de&s;ign, but executed in the highe&s;t perfection, and that in one of the fine&s;t theatres in the world; it is the grande &s;ale des machines in the Palais des Tuileries. Next day dined at Lord Waldegrave's; then to the opera. Imagine to your&s;elf for the drama four acts entirely unconnected with each other, each founded on &s;ome little hi&s;tory, &s;kilfully taken out of an ancient author, e. g. Ovid's Metamorpho&s;es, &amp;c. and with great addre&s;s converted into a French piece of gallantry. For in&s;tance, that which I
<PB N="46" REF="49">
&s;aw, called the Ballet de la Paix, had its fir&s;t act built upon the &s;tory of Nereus. Homer having &s;aid he was the hand&s;ome&s;t man of his time, the poet, imagining &s;uch a one could not want a mi&s;tre&s;s, has given him one. The&s;e two come in and &s;ing &s;entiment in lamentable &s;trains, neither air nor recitative; only, to one's great joy, they are every now and then interrupt|ed by a dance, or (to one's great &s;orrow) by a chorus that bor|ders the &s;tage from one end to the other, and &s;creams, pa&s;t all power of &s;imile to repre&s;ent. The &s;econd act was Baucis and Philemon. Baucis is a beautiful young &s;hepherde&s;s, and Phile|mon her &s;wain. Jupiter falls in love with her, but nothing will prevail upon her; &s;o it is all mighty well, and the chorus &s;ing and dance the prai&s;es of Con&s;tancy. The two other acts were about Iphis and Ianthe, and the Judgment of Paris. Imagine, I &s;ay, all this tran&s;acted by cracked voices, trilling divi&s;ions upon two notes and a half, accompanied by an orche&s;tra of hum&s;trums, and a whole hou&s;e more attentive than if Farinelli &s;ung, and you will almo&s;t have formed a ju&s;t notion of the thing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our author's &s;entiments here &s;eem to corre&s;pond entirely with tho&s;e which J. J. Rou&s;&s;eau afterwards publi&s;hed in his famous Lettre &s;ur la Mu&s;ique Fran|&ccedil;o&icirc;&s;e. In a french letter al&s;o, which Mr. Gray writ to his friend &s;oon after this, he calls their mu&s;ic <Q REND="inline">"des miaulemens &amp; des heurlemens effroyables, mel&eacute;s avec un tintamarre du diable: voil&agrave; la mu&s;ique Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e en abreg&eacute;."</Q></NOTE> Our a&s;toni&s;hment at their ab&s;urdity you can never con|ceive; we had enough to do to expre&s;s it by &s;creaming an hour louder than the whole dramatis per&s;onae. We have al&s;o &s;een twice the Comedie Fran&ccedil;oi&s;e; fir&s;t, the Mahomet Second, a tra|gedy that has had a great run of late; and the thing it&s;elf does not want its beauties, but the actors are beyond mea&s;ure de|lightful. Mademoi&s;elle Gou&s;&s;in (Mr. Voltaire's Zara) has with
<PB N="47" REF="50">
a charming (though little) per&s;on the mo&s;t pathetic tone of voice, the fine&s;t expre&s;&s;ion in her face, and mo&s;t proper action imaginable. There is al&s;o a Dufr&ecirc;ne, who did the chief cha|racter, a hand&s;ome man and a prodigious fine actor. The &s;econd we &s;aw was the Philo&s;ophe mari&eacute;, and here they performed as well in comedy; there is a Mademoi&s;elle Quinault, &s;omewhat in Mrs. Clive's way, and a Mon&s;ieur Grandval, in the nature of Wilks, who is the genteele&s;t thing in the world. There are &s;everal more would be much admired in England, and many (whom we have not &s;een) much celebrated here. Great part of our time is &s;pent in &s;eeing churches and palaces full of fine pictures, &amp;c. the quarter of which is not yet exhau&s;ted. For my part, I could entertain my&s;elf this month merely with the common &s;treets and the people in them.  ***</P>

<P>AFTER the little particulars afore&s;aid I &s;hould have pro|ceeded to a journal of our tran&s;actions for this week pa&s;t, &s;hould have carried you po&s;t from hence to Ver&s;ailles, hurried you through the gardens to Trianon, back again to Paris, &s;o away to Chantilly. But the fatigue is perhaps more than you can bear, and moreover I think I have rea&s;on to &s;to|mach your la&s;t piece of gravity. Suppo&s;ing you were in your &s;obere&s;t mood, I am &s;orry you &s;hould think me capable of ever being &s;o di&s;&s;ip&eacute;, &s;o evapor&eacute;, as not to be in a condition of
<PB N="48" REF="51">
reli&s;hing any thing you could &s;ay to me. And now, if you have a mind to make your peace with me, arou&s;e ye from your megrims and your melancholies, and (for exerci&s;e is good for you) throw away your night-cap, call for your jack-boots, and &s;et out with me, la&s;t Saturday evening, for Ver&s;ailles&mdash;and &s;o at eight o'clock, pa&s;&s;ing through a road &s;peckled with vines, and villas, and hares, and partridges, we arrive at the great avenue, flanked on either hand with a double row of trees about half a mile long, and with the palace it&s;elf to terminate the view; facing which, on each &s;ide of you is placed a &s;emi|circle of very hand&s;ome buildings, which form the &s;tables. The&s;e we will not enter into, becau&s;e you know we are no jockies. Well! and is this the great front of Ver&s;ailles? What a huge heap of littlene&s;s! it is compo&s;ed, as it were, of three courts, all open to the eye at once, and gradually dimi|ni&s;hing till you come to the royal apartments, which on this &s;ide pre&s;ent but half a dozen windows and a balcony. This la&s;t is all that can be called a front, for the re&s;t is only great wings. The hue of all this ma&s;s is black, dirty red, and yel|low; the fir&s;t proceeding from &s;tone changed by age; the &s;econd, from a mixture of brick; and the la&s;t, from a profu|&s;ion of tarni&s;hed gilding. You cannot &s;ee a more di&s;agreeable tout-en&s;emble; and, to fini&s;h the matter, it is all &s;tuck over in many places with &s;mall bu&s;ts of a tawny hue between every window. We pa&s;s through this to go into the garden, and here the ca&s;e is indeed altered; nothing can be va&s;ter and more magnificent than the back front; before it a very &s;pacious ter|race &s;preads it&s;elf, adorned with two large ba&s;ons; the&s;e are bordered and lined (as mo&s;t of the others) with white marble, with hand&s;ome &s;tatues of bronze reclined on their edges. From
<PB N="49" REF="52">
hence you de&s;cend a huge flight of &s;teps into a &s;emi-circle formed by woods, that are cut all round into niches, which are filled with beautiful copies of all the famous antique &s;tatues in white marble. Ju&s;t in the mid&s;t is the ba&s;on of Latona; &s;he and her children are &s;tanding on the top of a rock in the middle, on the &s;ides of which are the pea&s;ants, &s;ome half, &s;ome totally changed into frogs, all which throw out water at her in great plenty. From this place runs on the great alley, which brings you into a complete round, where is the ba&s;on of Apollo, the bigge&s;t in the gardens. He is ri&s;ing in his car out of the water, &s;urrounded by nymphs and tritons, all in bronze, and finely executed, and the&s;e, as they play, rai&s;e a perfect &s;torm about him; beyond this is the great canal, a prodigious long piece of water, that terminates the whole: All this you have at one coup d'oeil in entering the garden, which is truly great. I cannot &s;ay as much of the general ta&s;te of the place; every thing you behold &s;avours too much of art; all is forced, all is con&s;trained about you; &s;tatues and va&s;es &s;owed every where without di&s;tinction; &s;ugar-loaves and minced-pies of yew; &s;crawl-work of box, and little &s;quirt|ing jets-d'eau, be&s;ides a great &s;amene&s;s in the walks, cannot help &s;triking one at fir&s;t &s;ight, not to mention the &s;illie&s;t of labyrinths, and all Ae&s;op's fables in water; &s;ince the&s;e were de|&s;igned in u&s;um Delphini only. Here then we walk by moon|light, and hear the ladies and the nightingales &s;ing. Next morning, being Whit&s;unday, make ready to go to the In&s;talla|tion of nine Knights du Saint E&s;prit, Cambis is one: high ma&s;s celebrated with mu&s;ic, great croud, much incen&s;e, King, Queen, Dauphin, Me&s;dames, Cardinals, and Court: Knights arrayed by his maje&s;ty; reverences before the altar, not bows, but

curt&s;ies; &s;tiff hams; much tittering among the ladies; trum|pets, kettle-drums and fifes. My dear We&s;t, I am va&s;tly de|lighted with Trianon, all of us with Chantilly; if you would know why, you mu&s;t have patience, for I can hold my pen no longer, except to tell you that I &s;aw Britannicus la&s;t Night; all the characters, particularly Agrippina and Nero, done to per|fection; to-morrow Phaedra and Hippolitus.

<P>WE have now been &s;ettled almo&s;t three weeks in this city, which is more con&s;iderable upon account of its &s;ize and antiquity, than from the number of its inhabitants, or any advantages of commerce. There is little in it worth a &s;tranger's curio&s;ity, be&s;ides the cathedral church, which is a va&s;t Gothick building of a &s;urprizing beauty and lightne&s;s, all co|vered over with a profu&s;ion of little &s;tatues and other orna|ments. It is here the Kings of France are crowned by the Archbi&s;hop of Rheims, who is the fir&s;t Peer, and the Primate of the kingdom: The holy ve&s;&s;el made u&s;e of on that occa|&s;ion, which contains the oil, is kept in the church of St. Nica|&s;ius
<PB N="51" REF="54">
hard by, and is believed to have been brought by an angel from heaven at the coronation of Clovis, the fir&s;t chri&s;tian king. The &s;treets in general have but a melancholy a&s;pect, the hou&s;es all old; the public walks run along the &s;ide of a great moat under the ramparts, where one hears a continual croaking of frogs; the country round about is one great plain covered with vines, which at this time of the year afford no very plea&s;ing pro&s;pect, as being not above a foot high. What plea&s;ures the place denies to the &s;ight, it makes up to the palate; &s;ince you have nothing to drink but the be&s;t champaigne in the world, and all &s;ort of provi&s;ions equally good. As to other plea&s;ures, there is not that freedom of conver&s;ation among the people of fa&s;hion here, that one &s;ees in other parts of France; for though they are not very numerous in this place, and con&s;equent|ly mu&s;t live a good deal together, yet they never come to any great familiarity with one another. As my Lord Conway had &s;pent a good part of his time among them, his brother, and we with him, were &s;oon introduced into all their a&s;&s;emblies: As &s;oon as you enter, the lady of the hou&s;e pre&s;ents each of you a card, and offers you a party at quadrille; you &s;it down, and play forty deals without intermi&s;&s;ion, excepting one quar|ter of an hour, when every body ri&s;es to eat of what they call the gouter, which &s;upplies the place of our tea, and is a &s;ervice of wine, fruits, cream, &s;weetmeats, crawfi&s;h, and chee&s;e. Peo|ple take what they like, and &s;it down again to play; after that, they make little parties to go to the walks together, and then all the company retire to their &s;eparate habitations. Very &s;eldom any &s;uppers or dinners are given; and this is the manner they live among one another; not &s;o much out of any aver&s;ion they have to plea&s;ure, as out of a &s;ort of formality they have con|tracted

by not being much frequented by people who have lived at Paris. It is &s;ure they do not hate gaiety any more than the re&s;t of their country-people, and can enter into diver&s;ions, that are once propo&s;ed, with a good grace enough; for in&s;tance, the other evening we happened to be got together in a company of eighteen people, men and women of the be&s;t fa&s;hion here, at a garden in the town to walk; when one of the ladies bethought her&s;elf of a&s;king, Why &s;hould not we &s;up here? Immediately the cloth was laid by the &s;ide of a fountain under the trees, and a very elegant &s;upper &s;erved up; after which another &s;aid, Come, let us &s;ing; and directly began her&s;elf: From &s;inging we in|&s;en&s;ibly fell to dancing, and &s;inging in a round; when &s;ome|body mentioned the violins, and immediately a company of them was ordered: Minuets were begun in the open air, and then came country-dances, which held till four o'Clock next morning; at which hour the gaye&s;t lady there propo&s;ed, that &s;uch as were weary &s;hould get into their coaches, and the re&s;t of them &s;hould dance before them with the mu&s;ic in the van; and in this manner we paraded through all the principal &s;treets of the city, and waked every body in it. Mr. Walpole had a mind to make a cu&s;tom of the thing, and would have given a ball in the &s;ame manner next week, but the women did not come into it; &s;o I believe it will drop, and they will return to their dull cards, and u&s;ual formalities. We are not to &s;tay above a month longer here, and &s;hall then go to Dijon, the chief city of Burgundy, a very &s;plendid and a very gay town; at lea&s;t &s;uch is the pre&s;ent de&s;ign.</P>

<P>WE have made three &s;hort days journey of it from Rheims hither, where we arrived the night before la&s;t: The road we have pa&s;&s;ed through has been extremely agreeable; it runs through the mo&s;t fertile part of Champaigne by the &s;ide of the river Marne, with a chain of hills on each hand at &s;ome di&s;tance, entirely covered with woods and vineyards, and every now and then the ruins of &s;ome old ca&s;tle on their tops; we lay at St. Dizier the fir&s;t night, and at Langres the &s;econd, and got hither the next evening time enough to have a full view of this city in entering it: It lies in a very exten&s;ive plain covered with vines and corn, and con&s;equently is plentifully &s;upplied with both. I need not tell you that it is the chief city of Bur|gundy, nor that it is of great antiquity; con&s;idering which one &s;hould imagine it ought to be larger than one finds it. However, what it wants in extent, is made up in beauty and cleanline&s;s, and in rich convents and churches, mo&s;t of which we have &s;een. The palace of the States is a magnificent new building, where the Duke of Bourbon is lodged when he comes every three years to hold that A&s;&s;embly, as governour of the Province. A quarter of a mile out of the town is a famous Abbey of Carthu&s;ians, which we are ju&s;t returned from &s;ee|ing. In their chapel are the tombs of the ancient Dukes of Burgundy, that were &s;o powerful, till at the death of Charles the Bold, the la&s;t of them, this part of his dominions was united by Lewis XI. to the crown of France. To-morrow we
<PB N="54" REF="57">
are to pay a vi&s;it to the Abbot of the Ci&s;tercians, who lives a few leagues off, and who u&s;es to receive all &s;trangers with great civility; his Abbey is one of the riche&s;t in the king|dom; he keeps open hou&s;e always, and lives with great mag|nificence. We have &s;een enough of this town already, to make us regret the time we &s;pent at Rheims; it is full of people of condition, who &s;eem to form a much more agreeable &s;ociety than we found in Champaigne; but as we &s;hall &s;tay here but two or three days longer, it is not worth while to be introdu|ced into their hou&s;es. On Monday or Tue&s;day we are to &s;et out for Lyons, which is two days journey di&s;tant, and from thence you &s;hall hear again from me.</P>

The hou&s;es here are &s;o high, and the &s;treets &s;o narrow, as would be &s;ufficient to render Lyons the di&s;malle&s;t place in the world, but the number of people, and the face of commerce diffu&s;ed about it, are, at lea&s;t, as &s;ufficient to make it the livelie&s;t: Between the&s;e two &s;ufficiencies, you will be in doubt what to think of it; &s;o we &s;hall leave the city, and proceed to its environs, which are beautiful beyond expre&s;&s;ion; it is &s;urrounded with mountains, and tho&s;e mountains all bedroped and be&s;peckled with hou&s;es, gardens, and plantations of the rich Bourgeois, who have from thence a pro&s;pect of the city in the vale be|low on one hand, on the other the rich plains of the Lyonnois, with the rivers winding among them, and the Alps, with the mountains of Dauphin&eacute;, to bound the view. All ye&s;terday morning we were bu&s;ied in climbing up Mount Fourviere, where the ancient city &s;tood perched at &s;uch a height, that no|thing but the hopes of gain could certainly ever per&s;uade their neighbours to pay them a vi&s;it: Here are the ruins of the

Emperor's palaces, that re&s;ided here, that is to &s;ay, Augu&s;tus and Severus; they con&s;i&s;t in nothing but great ma&s;&s;es of old wall, that have only their quality to make them re&s;pected. In a vineyard of the Minims are remains of a theatre; the Fathers, whom they belong to, hold them in no e&s;teem at all, and would have &s;howed us their &s;acri&s;ty and chapel in&s;tead of them: The Ur&s;uline Nuns have in their garden &s;ome Roman baths, but we having the misfortune to be men, and heretics, they did not think proper to admit us. Hard by are eight arches of a mo&s;t magnificent aqueduct, &s;aid to be erected by Antony, when his legions were quartered here: There are many other parts of it di&s;per&s;ed up and down the country, for it brought the water from a river many leagues off in La Forez. Here are remains too of Agrippa's &s;even great roads which met at Lyons; in &s;ome places they lie twelve feet deep in the ground: In &s;hort, a thou|&s;and matters that you &s;hall not know, till you give me a de|&s;cription of the Pa&iuml;s de Tombridge, and the effect its waters have upon you.</P>

<P>IF wi&s;hes could turn to realities, I would fling down my law books, and &s;up with you to-night. But, alas, here am I doomed to fix, while you are fluttering from city to city, and enjoying all the plea&s;ures which a gay climate can afford.

<P>IT is now almo&s;t five weeks &s;ince I left Dijon, one of the gaye&s;t and mo&s;t agreeable little cities of France, for Lyons, its rever&s;e in all the&s;e particulars. It is the &s;econd in the king|dom in bigne&s;s and rank, the &s;treets exce&s;&s;ively narrow and na&s;ty; the hou&s;es immen&s;ely high and large; (that, for in|&s;tance, where we are lodged, has twenty-five rooms on a floor, and that for five &s;tories) it &s;warms with inhabitants like Paris it&s;elf, but chiefly a mercantile people, too much given up to commerce to think of their own, much le&s;s of a &s;tranger's diver&s;ions. We have no acquaintance in the town, but &s;uch Engli&s;h as happen to be pa&s;&s;ing through here, in their way to Italy and the South, which at pre&s;ent happen to be near thirty in number. It is a fortnight &s;ince we &s;et out from hence upon a little excur&s;ion to Geneva. We took the longe&s;t road, which lies through Savoy, on purpo&s;e to &s;ee a famous mona&s;tery, called the grand Chartreu&s;e, and had no rea&s;on to think our time lo&s;t. After having travelled &s;even days very &s;low (for we
<PB N="59" REF="62">
did not change hor&s;es, it being impo&s;&s;ible for a chai&s;e to go po&s;t in the&s;e roads) we arrived at a little village, among the moun|tains of Savoy, called Echelles; from thence we proceeded on hor&s;es, who are u&s;ed to the way, to the mountain of the Chartreu&s;e: It is &s;ix miles to the top; the road runs winding up it, commonly not &s;ix feet broad; on one hand is the rock, with woods of pine-trees hanging over head; on the other, a mon|&s;trous precipice, almo&s;t perpendicular, at the bottom of which rolls a torrent, that &s;ometimes tumbling among the fragments of &s;tone that have fallen from on high, and &s;ometimes precipitating it&s;elf down va&s;t de&s;cents with a noi&s;e like thunder, which is &s;till made greater by the echo from the mountains on each &s;ide, con|curs to form one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn, the mo&s;t romantic, and the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cenes I ever beheld: Add to this the &s;trange views made by the craggs and cliffs on the other hand; the ca&s;cades that in many places throw them&s;elves from the very &s;ummit down into the vale, and the river below; and many other particulars impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe; you will con|clude we had no occa&s;ion to repent our pains. This place St. Bruno cho&s;e to retire to, and upon its very top founded the afore&s;aid Convent, which is the &s;uperior of the whole order. When we came there, the two fathers, who are commi&s;&s;ioned to entertain &s;trangers, (for the re&s;t mu&s;t neither &s;peak one to another, nor to any one el&s;e) received us very kindly; and &s;et be|fore us a repa&s;t of dried fi&s;h, eggs, butter, and fruits, all ex|cellent in their kind, and extremely neat. They pre&s;&s;ed us to &s;pend the night there, and to &s;tay &s;ome days with them; but this we could not do, &s;o they led us about their hou&s;e, which is, you mu&s;t think, like a little city; for there are 100 fathers, be&s;ides 300 &s;ervants, that make their clothes, grind their corn,
<PB N="60" REF="63">
pre&s;s their wine, and do every thing among them&s;elves: The whole is quite orderly and &s;imple; nothing of finery, but the wonderful decency, and the &s;trange &s;ituation, more than &s;up|ply the place of it. In the evening we de&s;cended by the &s;ame way, pa&s;&s;ing through many clouds that were then forming them&s;elves on the mountain's &s;ide. Next day we continued our journey by Chamberry, which, though the chief city of the Dutchy, and re&s;idence of the king of Sardinia, when he comes into this part of his dominions, makes but a very mean and in&s;ignificant appearance; we lay at Aix, once famous for its hot baths, and the next night at Annecy; the day after, by noon, we got to Geneva. I have not time to &s;ay any thing about it, nor of our &s;olitary journey back again. ***</P>

<P>IN my la&s;t I gave you the particulars of our little journey to Geneva; I have only to add, that we &s;tayed about a week, in order to &s;ee Mr. Conway &s;ettled there: I do not wonder &s;o many Engli&s;h choo&s;e it for their re&s;idence; the city is very &s;mall, neat, prettily built, and extremely populous; the Rh&ocirc;ne runs through the middle of it, and it is &s;urrounded with new fortifications, that give it a military compact air; which, joined to the happy, lively countenances of the inhabitants, and an exact di&s;cipline always as &s;trictly ob&s;erved as in time of war, makes the little republic appear a match for a much greater
<PB N="61" REF="64">
power; though perhaps Geneva, and all that belongs to it, are not of equal extent with Wind&s;or and its two parks. To one that has pa&s;&s;ed through Savoy, as we did, nothing can be more &s;triking than the contra&s;t, as &s;oon as he approaches the town. Near the gates of Geneva runs the torrent Arve, which &s;epa|rates it from the King of Sardinia's dominions; on the other &s;ide of it lies a country naturally, indeed, fine and fertile; but you meet with nothing in it but meager, ragged, bare-footed pea&s;ants, with their children, in extreme mi&s;ery and na&s;tine&s;s; and even of the&s;e no great numbers: You no &s;ooner have cro&s;&s;ed the &s;tream I have mentioned, but poverty is no more; not a beggar, hardly a di&s;contented face to be &s;een; numerous, and well-dre&s;&s;ed people &s;warming on the ramparts; drums beat|ing; &s;oldiers, well-cloathed and armed, exerci&s;ing; and folks, with bu&s;ine&s;s in their looks, hurrying to and fro; all contribute to make any per&s;on, who is not blind, &s;en&s;ible what a difference there is between the two governments, that are the cau&s;es of one view and the other. The beautiful lake, at one end of which the town is &s;ituated; its extent; the &s;everal &s;tates that border upon it; and all its plea&s;ures, are too well known for me to mention them. We &s;ailed upon it as far as the domi|nions of Geneva extend, that is, about two leagues and a half on each &s;ide; and landed at &s;everal of the little hou&s;es of plea|&s;ure, that the inhabitants have built all about it, who received us with much politene&s;s. The &s;ame night we eat part of a trout, taken in the lake, that weighed thirty-&s;even pounds; as great a mon&s;ter as it appeared to us, it was e&s;teemed there no|thing extraordinary, and they a&s;&s;ured us, it was not uncommon to catch them of fifty pounds; they are dre&s;&s;ed here, and &s;ent po&s;t to Paris upon &s;ome great occa&s;ions; nay, even to Madrid,
<PB N="62" REF="65">
as we were told. The road we returned through was not the &s;ame we came by: We cro&s;&s;ed the Rh&ocirc;ne at Sey&s;&s;el, and pa&s;&s;ed for three days among the mountains of Bugey, without meet|ing with any thing new: At la&s;t we came out into the plains of La Bre&s;&s;e, and &s;o to Lyons again. Sir Robert has written to Mr. Walpole, to de&s;ire he would go to Italy; which he has re&s;olved to do; &s;o that all the &s;cheme of &s;pending the winter in the South of France is laid a&s;ide, and we are to pa&s;s it in a much finer country. You may imagine I am not &s;orry to have this opportunity of &s;eeing the place in the world that be&s;t de|&s;erves it: Be&s;ides as the Pope (who is eighty-eight, and has been lately at the point of death) cannot probably la&s;t a great while, perhaps we may have the fortune to be pre&s;ent at the election of a new one, when Rome will be in all its glory. Friday next we certainly begin our journey; in two days we &s;hall come to the foot of the Alps, and &s;ix more we &s;hall be in pa&s;&s;ing them. Even here the winter is begun; what then mu&s;t it be among tho&s;e va&s;t &s;nowy mountains where it is hardly ever &s;ummer? We are, however, as well armed as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t the cold, with muffs, hoods, and ma&s;ks of bever, fur-boots, and bear &s;kins. When we arrive at Turin, we &s;hall re&s;t after the fatigues of the journey. ***</P>

<P>I AM this night arrived here, and have ju&s;t &s;et down to re&s;t me after eight days tire&s;ome journey: For the three fir&s;t we had the &s;ame road we before pa&s;t through to go to Geneva; the fourth we turned out of it, and for that day and the next travelled rather among than upon the Alps; the way commonly running through a deep valley by the &s;ide of the river Arc, which works it&s;elf a pa&s;&s;age, with great difficulty and a mighty noi&s;e, among va&s;t quantities of rocks, that have rolled down from the mountain tops. The winter was &s;o far advanced, as in great mea&s;ure to &s;poil the beauty of the pro&s;pect; however, there was &s;till &s;omewhat fine remaining amid&s;t the &s;avagene&s;s and horrour of the place: The &s;ixth we began to go up &s;everal of the&s;e mountains; and as we were pa&s;&s;ing one, met with an odd accident enough: Mr. Walpole had a little fat black &s;paniel, that he was very fond of, which he &s;ometimes u&s;ed to &s;et down, and let it run by the chai&s;e &s;ide. We were at that time in a very rough road, not two yards broad at mo&s;t; on one &s;ide was a great wood of pines, and on the other a va&s;t precipice; it was noon-day, and the &s;un &s;hone bright, when all of a &s;udden, from the wood-&s;ide, (which was as &s;teep upwards, as the other part was downwards) out ru&s;hed a great wolf, came clo&s;e to the head of the hor&s;es, &s;eized the dog by the throat, and ru&s;hed up the hill again with him in his mouth. This was done in le&s;s than a quarter of a minute; we all &s;aw it, and yet the &s;ervants had not time to draw their pi&s;tols, or do any thing to
<PB N="64" REF="67">
&s;ave the dog<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This odd incident might have afforded Mr. Gray a &s;ubject for an ode, which would have been a good companion to that on the death of a favourite cat.</NOTE>. If he had not been there, and the creature had thought fit to lay hold of one of the hor&s;es; chai&s;e, and we, and all mu&s;t inevitably have tumbled above fifty fathoms per|pendicular down the precipice. The &s;eventh we came to Lanebourg, the la&s;t town in Savoy; it lies at the foot of the famous mount Cenis, which is &s;o &s;ituated as to allow no room for any way but over the very top of it. Here the chai&s;e was forced to be pulled to pieces, and the baggage and that to be carried by mules: We our&s;elves were wrapped up in our furs, and &s;eated upon a &s;ort of matted chair without legs, which is carried upon poles in the manner of a bier, and &s;o begun to a&s;cend by the help of eight men. It was &s;ix miles to the top, where a plain opens it&s;elf about as many more in breadth, covered perpetually with very deep &s;now, and in the mid&s;t of that a great lake of unfathomable depth, from whence a river takes its ri&s;e, and tumbles over mon&s;trous rocks quite down the other &s;ide of the mountain. The de&s;cent is &s;ix miles more, but infinitely more &s;teep than the going up; and here the men perfectly fly down with you, &s;tepping from &s;tone to &s;tone with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s in places where none but they could go three paces without falling. The immen&s;ity of the preci|pices, the roaring of the river and torrents that run into it, the huge craggs covered with ice and &s;now, and the clouds below you and about you, are objects it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive with|out &s;eeing them; and though we had heard many &s;trange de|&s;criptions of the &s;cene, none of them at all came up to it. We were but five hours in performing the whole, from which you may judge of the rapidity of the men's motion. We are now
<PB N="65" REF="68">
got into Piedmont, and &s;topped a little while at La Ferriere, a &s;mall village about three quarters of the way down, but &s;till among the clouds, where we began to hear a new language &s;poken round about us; at la&s;t we got quite down, went through the P&aacute;s de Su&s;e, a narrow road among the Alps, defended by two for|tre&s;&s;es, and lay at Bo&s;&s;olens: Next evening thro' a fine avenue of nine miles in length, as &s;traight as a line, we arrived at this city, which, as you know, is the capital of the Principality, and the re&s;idence of the King of Sardinia.<NOTE N="***" PLACE="foot">That part of the letter here omitted, contained only a de&s;cription of the city; which, as Mr. Gray has given it to Mr. We&s;t in the following letter, and that in a more lively manner, I thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert.

all laid out by the line, regular uniform buildings, fine walks that &s;urround the whole, and in general a good lively clean ap|pearance: But the hou&s;es are of brick plai&s;tered, which is apt to want repairing; the windows of oiled paper, which is apt to be torn; and every thing very &s;light, which is apt to tumble down. There is an excellent Opera, but it is only in the Car|nival: Balls every night, but only in the Carnival: Ma&s;que|rades too, but only in the Carnival. This Carnival la&s;ts only from Chri&s;tmas to Lent; one half of the remaining part of the year is pa&s;t in remembering the la&s;t, the other in expecting the future Carnival. We cannot well &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch &s;lender diet, no more than upon an execrable Italian Comedy, and a Puppet-Show, called Rappre&s;entazione d'un' anima dannata, which, I think, are all the pre&s;ent diver&s;ions of the place; ex|cept the Marqui&s;e de Cavaillac's Conver&s;azione, where one goes to &s;ee people play at Ombre and Taroc, a game with 72 cards all painted with &s;uns, and moons, and devils and monks. Mr. Walpole has been at court; the family are at pre&s;ent at a country palace, called La Venerie. The palace here in town is the very quinte&s;&s;ence of gilding and looking-gla&s;s; inlaid floors, carved pannels, and painting, wherever they could &s;tick a bru&s;h. I own I have not, as yet, any where met with tho&s;e grand and &s;imple works of Art, that are to amaze one, and who&s;e &s;ight one is to be the better for: But tho&s;e of Nature have a&s;toni&s;hed me beyond expre&s;&s;ion. In our little journey up to the Grande Chartreu&s;e, I do not remember to have gone ten paces without an exclamation, that there was no re&s;training: Not a precipice, not a torrent, not a cliff, but is pregnant with religion and poetry. There are certain &s;cenes that would awe an athei&s;t into belief, without the help of other argument. One need
<PB N="67" REF="70">
not have a very fanta&s;tic imagination to &s;ee &s;pirits there at noon|day: You have Death perpetually before your eyes, only &s;o far removed, as to compo&s;e the mind without frighting it. I am well per&s;uaded St. Bruno was a man of no common genius, to choo&s;e &s;uch a &s;ituation for his retirement; and perhaps &s;hould have been a di&s;ciple of his, had I been born in his time. You may believe Abelard and Helo&iuml;&s;e were not forgot upon this oc|ca&s;ion: If I do not mi&s;take, I &s;aw you too every now and then at a di&s;tance among the trees; il me &s;emble, que j'ai vu ce chien de vi&s;age l&agrave; quelque part. You &s;eemed to call to me from the other &s;ide of the precipice, but the noi&s;e of the river below was &s;o great, that I really could not di&s;tingui&s;h what you &s;aid; it &s;eemed to have a cadence like ver&s;e. In your next you will be &s;o good to let me know what it was. The week we have &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed among the Alps, has not equalled the &s;ingle day upon that mountain, becau&s;e the winter was rather too far advanced, and the weather a little foggy. However, it did not want its beauties; the &s;avage rudene&s;s of the view is incon|ceivable without &s;eeing it: I reckoned, in one day, thirteen ca&s;cades, the lea&s;t of which was, I dare &s;ay, one hundred feet in height. I had Livy in the chai&s;e with me, and beheld his <Q REND="inline">"Nives coelo prop&egrave; immi&s;tae, tecta informia impo&s;ita rupi|bus, pecora jumentaque torrida frigore, homines inton&s;i &amp; inculti, animalia inanimaque omnia rigentia gelu; omnia con|frago&s;a, praeruptaque."</Q> The creatures that inhabit them are, in all re&s;pects, below humanity; and mo&s;t of them, e&s;pecially women, have the tumidum guttur, which they call go&s;cia. Mont Cenis, I confe&s;s, carries the permi&s;&s;ion mountains have of being frightful rather too far; and its horrours were ac|companied with too much danger to give one time to reflect
<PB N="68" REF="71">
upon their beauties. There is a family of the Alpine mon&s;ters I have mentioned, upon its very top, that in the middle of winter calmly lay in their &s;tock of provi&s;ions and firing, and &s;o are buried in their hut for a month or two under the &s;now. When we were down it, and got a little way into Piedmont, we began to find <Q REND="inline">"Apricos quo&s;dam colles, rivo&s;que prope &s;yl|vas, et jam humano cultu digniora loca."</Q> I read Silius Italicus too, for the fir&s;t time; and wi&s;hed for you, according to cu&s;tom.

<PB N="69" REF="72">
you an account of, for we arrived late la&s;t night. To-day was, luckily, a great fe&s;tival, and in the morning we re&s;orted to the church of the Madonna delle Vigne, to put up our little ori|&s;ons; (I believe I forgot to tell you, that we have been &s;ome|time converts to the holy Catholic church) we found our Lady richly dre&s;&s;ed out, with a crown of diamonds on her own head, another upon the child's, and a con&s;tellation of wax lights burning before them: Shortly after came the Doge, in his robes of crim&s;on dama&s;k, and a cap of the &s;ame, followed by the Senate in black. Upon his approach began a fine concert of mu&s;ic, and among the re&s;t two eunuchs' voices, that were a perfect fea&s;t to ears that had heard nothing but French operas for a year. We li&s;tened to this, and breathed nothing but in|cen&s;e for two hours. The Doge is a very tall, lean, &s;tately, old figure, called Co&s;tantino Balbi; and the Senate &s;eem to have been made upon the &s;ame model. They &s;aid their prayers, and heard an ab&s;urd white friar preach, with equal devotion. After this we went to the Annonciata, a church built by the family Lomellini, and belonging to it; which is, indeed, a mo&s;t &s;tately &s;tructure, the in&s;ide wholly marble of various kinds, ex|cept where gold and painting take its place. From hence to the Palazzo Doria. I &s;hould make you &s;ick of marble, if I told you how it was lavi&s;hed here upon the porticoes, the balu&s;trades, and terra&s;es, the lowe&s;t of which extends quite to the &s;ea. The in&s;ide is by no means an&s;werable to the outward magnificence; the furniture &s;eems to be as old as the founder of the family. There great imbo&s;&s;ed &s;ilver tables tell you, in bas-relief, his victories at &s;ea; how he entertained the Emperor Charles, and how he refu&s;ed the &s;overeignty of the Commonwealth when it was offered him; the re&s;t is old-fa&s;hioned velvet chairs, and

gothic tape&s;try. The re&s;t of the day has been &s;pent, much to our hearts' content, in cur&s;ing French mu&s;ic and architecture, and in &s;inging the prai&s;es of Italy. We find this place &s;o very fine, that we are in fear of finding nothing finer. We are fallen in love with the Mediterranean &s;ea, and hold your lakes and your rivers in va&s;t contempt.

<P>OUR journey hither has taken up much le&s;s time than I expected. We left Genoa (a charming place, and one that de&s;erved a longer &s;tay) the week before la&s;t; cro&s;&s;ed the mountains, and lay that night at Tortona, the next at St. Giovan|ni, and the morning after came to Piacenza. That city, (though the capital of a Dutchy) made &s;o frippery an appearance, that in&s;tead of &s;pending &s;ome days there, as had been intended, we only dined, and went on to Parma; &s;tayed there all the fol|lowing day, which was pa&s;&s;ed in vi&s;iting the famous works of Corregio in the Dome, and other churches. The fine gallery of pictures, that once belonged to the Dukes of Parma, is no more here; the King of Naples has carried it all thither, and the city had not merit enough to detain us any longer, &s;o we proceeded
<PB N="71" REF="74">
through Reggio to Modena; this, though the re&s;idence of its Duke, is an ill-built melancholy place, all of brick, as are mo&s;t of the towns in this part of Lombardy: He him&s;elf lives in a private manner, with very little appearance of a court about him; he has one of the noble&s;t collections of paintings in the world, which entertained us extremely well the re&s;t of that day and a part of the next; and in the afternoon we came to Bologna: So now you may wi&s;h us joy of being in the domi|nions of his Holine&s;s. This is a populous city, and of great extent: All the &s;treets have porticoes on both &s;ides, &s;uch as &s;ur|round a part of Covent-Garden, a great relief in &s;ummer-time in &s;uch a climate; and from one of the principal gates to a church of the Virgin, [where is a wonder-working picture, at three miles di&s;tance] runs a corridore of the &s;ame &s;ort, lately fini&s;hed, and, indeed, a mo&s;t extraordinary performance. The churches here are more remarkable for their paintings than architecture, being mo&s;tly old &s;tructures of brick; but the palaces are numerous, and fine enough to &s;upply us with &s;ome|what worth &s;eeing from morning till night. The country of Lombardy, hitherto, is one of the mo&s;t beautiful imaginable; the roads broad, and exactly &s;traight, and on either hand va&s;t plantations of trees, chiefly mulberries and olives, and not a tree without a vine twining about it and &s;preading among its branches. This &s;cene, indeed, which mu&s;t be the mo&s;t lovely in the world during the proper &s;ea&s;on, is at pre&s;ent all deform|ed by the winter, which here is rigorous enough for the time it la&s;ts; but one &s;till &s;ees the &s;keleton of a charming place, and reaps the benefit of its product, for the fruits and provi&s;ions are admirable; in &s;hort you find every thing, that luxury can de&s;ire, in perfection. We have now been here a week, and
<PB N="72" REF="75">
&s;hall &s;tay &s;ome little time longer. We are at the foot of the Apennine mountains; it will take up three days to cro&s;s them, and then we &s;hall come to Florence, where we &s;hall pa&s;s the Chri&s;t|mas. Till then we mu&s;t remain in a &s;tate of ignorance as to what is doing in England, for our letters are to meet us there: If I do not find four or five from you alone, I &s;hall wonder.</P>

<P>WE &s;pent twelve days at Bologna, chiefly (as mo&s;t travellers do) in &s;eeing &s;ights; for as we knew no mortal there, and as it is no ea&s;y matter to get admi&s;&s;ion into any Italian hou&s;e, without very particular recommendations, we could &s;ee no com|pany but in public places; and there are none in that city but the churches. We &s;aw, therefore, churches, palaces, and pictures from morning to night; and the 15th of this month &s;et out for Florence, and began to cro&s;s the Apennine mountains; we tra|velled among and upon them all that day, and, as it was but in|different weather, were commonly in the middle of thick clouds, that utterly deprived us of a &s;ight of their beauties: For this va&s;t chain of hills has its beauties, and all the vallies are culti|vated; even the mountains them&s;elves are many of them &s;o within a little of their very tops. They are not &s;o horrid as the Alps, though pretty near as high; and the whole road is admirably well kept, and paved throughout, which is a length of four&s;core miles, and more: We left the Pope's dominions,
<PB N="73" REF="76">
and lay that night in tho&s;e of the Grand Duke at Fiorenzuola, a paltry little town, at the foot of Mount Giogo, which is the highe&s;t of them all. Next morning we went up it; the po&s;t|hou&s;e is upon its very top, and u&s;ually involved in clouds, or half-buried in the &s;now. Indeed there was none of the la&s;t at the time we were there, but it was &s;till a di&s;mal habitation. The de&s;cent is mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ively &s;teep, and the turnings very &s;hort and frequent; however, we performed it without any danger, and in coming down could dimly di&s;cover Florence, and the beautiful plain about it, through the mi&s;ts; but enough to convince us, it mu&s;t be one of the noble&s;t pro&s;pects upon earth in &s;ummer. That afternoon we got thither; and Mr. Mann<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now Sir Horace Mann, and Envoy Extraordinary at the &s;ame court.</NOTE>, the re&s;ident, had &s;ent his &s;ervant to meet us at the gates, and conduct us to his hou&s;e. He is the be&s;t and mo&s;t obliging per&s;on in the world. The next night we were introduced at the Prince of Craon's a&s;&s;embly (he has the chief power here in the Grand Duke's ab&s;ence). The Prince&s;s, and he, were extremely civil to the name of Walpole, &s;o we were a&s;ked to &s;tay &s;upper, which is as much as to &s;ay, you may come and &s;up here whenever you plea&s;e; for after the fir&s;t invitation this is always under&s;tood. We have al&s;o been at the Counte&s;s Suarez's, a favourite of the late Duke, and one that gives the fir&s;t movement to every thing gay that is going forward here. The news is every day expected from Vienna of the Great Dutche&s;s's delivery; if it be a boy, here will be all &s;orts of balls, ma&s;querades, operas, and illuminations; if not, we mu&s;t wait for the Carnival, when all tho&s;e things come of cour&s;e. In the mean time it is impo&s;&s;ible to want enter|tainment;
<PB N="74" REF="77">
the famous gallery, alone, is an amu&s;ement for months; we commonly pa&s;s two or three hours every morning in it, and one has perfect lei&s;ure to con&s;ider all its beauties. You know it contains many hundred antique &s;tatues, &s;uch as the whole world cannot match, be&s;ides the va&s;t collection of paint|ings, medals, and precious &s;tones, &s;uch as no other prince was ever ma&s;ter of; in &s;hort, all that the rich and powerful hou&s;e of Medicis has in &s;o many years got tog&eacute;ther.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He catalogued and made occa&s;ional &s;hort remarks on the pictures, &amp;c. which he &s;aw here, as well as at other places, many of which are in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but it would have &s;welled this work too much if I had in&s;erted them.</NOTE> And be&s;ides this city abounds with &s;o many palaces and churches, that you can hardly place your&s;elf any where without having &s;ome fine one in view, or at lea&s;t &s;ome &s;tatue or fountain, magnificently adorned; the&s;e, undoubtedly, are far more nu|merous than Genoa can pretend to; yet, in its general appear|ance, I cannot think that Florence equals it in beauty. Mr. Walpole is ju&s;t come from being pre&s;ented to the Electre&s;s Palatine Dowager; &s;he is a &s;i&s;ter of the late Great Duke's; a &s;tately old lady, that never goes out but to church, and then &s;he has guards, and eight hor&s;es to her coach. She received him with much ceremony, &s;tanding under a huge black canopy, and, after a few minutes talking, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him of her good will, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him: She never &s;ees any body but thus in form; and &s;o &s;he pa&s;&s;es her life, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Per&s;ons of very high rank, and withal very good &s;en&s;e, will only feel the pathos of this exclamation.</NOTE>poor woman! ***</P>

<P>THIS is the third day &s;ince we came to Rome, but the fir&s;t hour I have had to write to you in. The journey from Florence co&s;t us four days, one of which was &s;pent at Sienna, an agreeable, clean, old city, of no great magnificence, or extent; but in a fine &s;ituation, and good air. What it has mo&s;t con&s;iderable is its cathedral, a huge pile of marble, black and white laid alternately, and laboured with a gothic nicene&s;s
<PB N="79" REF="82">
and delicacy in the old-fa&s;hioned way. Within too are &s;ome paintings and &s;culpture of con&s;iderable hands. The &s;ight of this, and &s;ome collections that were &s;howed us in private hou&s;es, were a &s;ufficient employment for the little time we were to pa&s;s there; and the next morning we &s;et forward on our journey through a country very oddly compo&s;ed; for &s;ome miles you have a continual &s;cene of little mountains cultivated from top to bottom with rows of olive-trees, or el&s;e elms, each of which has its vine twining about it, and mixing with the branches; and corn &s;own between all the ranks. This, diver|&s;ified with numerous &s;mall hou&s;es and convents, makes the mo&s;t agreeable pro&s;pect in the world: But, all of a &s;udden, it alters to black barren hills, as far as the eye can reach, that &s;eem never to have been capable of culture, and are as ugly as u&s;ele&s;s. Such is the country for &s;ome time before one comes to Mount Radicofani, a terrible black hill, on the top of which we were to lodge that night. It is very high, and difficult of a&s;cent; and at the foot of it we were much embarra&s;&s;ed by the fall of one of the poor hor&s;es that drew us. This accident obliged another chai&s;e, which was coming down, to &s;top al&s;o; and out of it peeped a figure in a red cloak, with a handkerchief tied round its head, which, by its voice and mien, &s;eemed a fat old woman; but, upon its getting out, appeared to be Sene&s;ino, who was returning from Naples to Sienna, the place of his birth and re&s;idence. On the highe&s;t part of the mountain is an old fortre&s;s, and near it a hou&s;e built by one of the Grand Dukes for a hunting-&s;eat, but now converted into an inn: It is the &s;hell of a large fabrick, but &s;uch an in&s;ide, &s;uch cham|bers, and accommodations, that your cellar is a palace in com|pari&s;on; and your cat &s;ups and lies much better than we did;
<PB N="80" REF="83">
for, it being a &s;aint's eve, there were nothing but eggs. We devoured our meager fare; and, after &s;topping up the windows with the quilts, were obliged to lie upon the &s;traw beds in our clothes. Such are the conveniences in a road, that is, as it were, the great thoroughfare of all the world. Ju&s;t on the other &s;ide of this mountain, at Ponte-Centino, one enters the patrimony of the church; a mo&s;t delicious country, but thinly inhabited. That night brought us to Viterbo, a city of a more lively appearance than any we had lately met with; the hou&s;es have gla&s;s windows, which is not very u&s;ual here, and mo&s;t of the &s;treets are terminated by a hand&s;ome fountain. Here we had the plea&s;ure of breaking our fa&s;t on the leg of an old hare and &s;ome broiled crows. Next morning, in de&s;cending Mount Viterbo, we fir&s;t di&s;covered (though at near thirty miles di&s;tance) the cupola of St. Peter's, and a little after began to enter on an old Roman pavement, with now and then a ruined tower, or a &s;epulcher on each hand. We now had a clear view of the city, though not to the be&s;t advantage, as coming along a plain quite upon a level with it; however, it appeared very va&s;t, and &s;urrounded with magnificent villas and gardens. We &s;oon after cro&s;&s;ed the Tiber, a river that ancient Rome made more con&s;iderable than any merit of its own could have done: However, it is not contemptibly &s;mall, but a good hand|&s;ome &s;tream; very deep, yet &s;omewhat of a muddy complex|ion. The fir&s;t entrance of Rome is prodigiou&s;ly &s;triking. It is by a noble gate, de&s;igned by Michel Angelo, and adorned with &s;tatues; this brings you into a large &s;quare, in the mid&s;t of which is a va&s;t obeli&s;k of granite, and in front you have at one view two churches of a hand&s;ome architecture, and &s;o much alike that they are called the twins; with three &s;treets, the mid|dlemo&s;t
<PB N="81" REF="84">
of which is one of the longe&s;t in Rome. As high as my expectation was rai&s;ed, I confe&s;s, the magnificence of this city infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;es it. You cannot pa&s;s along a &s;treet but you have views of &s;ome palace, or church, or &s;quare, or foun|tain, the mo&s;t picture&s;que and noble one can imagine. We have not yet &s;et about con&s;idering its beauties, ancient and modern, with attention; but have already taken a &s;light tran&s;ient view of &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable. St. Peter's I &s;aw the day after we arrived, and was &s;truck dumb with wonder. I there &s;aw the Cardinal d'Auvergne, one of the French ones, who, upon coming off his journey, immediately repaired hither to offer up his vows at the high altar, and went directly into the Con|clave; the doors of which we &s;aw opened to him, and all the other immured Cardinals came thither to receive him. Upon his entrance they were clo&s;ed again directly. It is &s;up|po&s;ed they will not come to an agreement about a Pope till after Ea&s;ter, though the confinement is very di&s;agreeable. I have hardly philo&s;ophy enough to &s;ee the infinity of fine things, that are here daily in the power of any body that has money, without regretting the want of it; but cu&s;tom has the power of making things ea&s;y to one. I have not yet &s;een his maje&s;ty of Great-Britain, &amp;c. though I have the two boys in the gar|dens of the Villa Borge&s;e, where they go a-&s;hooting almo&s;t every day; it was at a di&s;tance, indeed, for we did not choo&s;e to meet them, as you may imagine. This letter (like all tho&s;e the Engli&s;h &s;end, or receive) will pa&s;s through the hands of that family, before it comes to tho&s;e it was intended for. They do it more honour than it de&s;erves; and all they will learn from thence will be, that I de&s;ire you to give my duty to my father, and wherever el&s;e it is due, and that I am, &amp;c.</P>

<P>TO-DAY I am ju&s;t come from paying my adoration at St. Peter's to three extraordinary reliques, which are expo&s;ed to public view only on the&s;e two days in the whole year, at which time all the confraternities in the city come in proce&s;&s;ion to &s;ee them. It was &s;omething extremely novel to &s;ee that va&s;t church, and the mo&s;t magnificent in the world, undoubtedly, illuminated (for it was night) by thou&s;ands of little cry&s;tal lamps, di&s;po&s;ed in the figure of a huge cro&s;s at the high altar, and &s;eeming to hang alone in the air. All the light proceeded from this, and had the mo&s;t &s;ingular effect imaginable as one entered the great door. Soon after came one after ano|ther, I believe, thirty proce&s;&s;ions, all dre&s;&s;ed in linen frocks, and girt with a cord, their heads covered with a cowl all over, only two holes to &s;ee through left. Some of them were all black, others red, others white, others party-coloured; the&s;e were continually coming and going with their tapers and cruci|fixes before them; and to each company, as they arrived and knelt before the great altar, were &s;hown from a balcony at a great height, the three wonders, which are, you mu&s;t know, the head of the &s;pear that wounded Chri&s;t; St. Veronica's hand|kerchief, with the miraculous impre&s;&s;ion of his face upon it; and a piece of the true cro&s;s, on the &s;ight of which the people thump their brea&s;ts, and ki&s;s the pavement with va&s;t devotion. The tragical part of the ceremony is half a dozen wretched

creatures, who with their faces covered, but naked to the wai&s;t, are in a &s;ide-chapel di&s;ciplining them&s;elves with &s;courges full of iron prickles; but really in earne&s;t, as our eyes can te&s;tify, which &s;aw their backs and arms &s;o raw we &s;hould have taken it for a red &s;attin doublet torn, and &s;hewing the &s;kin through, had we not been convinced of the contrary by the blood which was plentifully &s;prinkled about them.

<P>THIS day being in the palace of his Highne&s;s the Duke of Modena, he laid his mo&s;t &s;erene commands upon me to write to Mr. We&s;t, and &s;aid he thought it for his glory, that I &s;hould draw up an inventory of all his mo&s;t &s;erene po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions for the &s;aid We&s;t's peru&s;al.&mdash;Imprimis, a hou&s;e, being in circum|ference a quarter of a mile, two feet and an inch; the &s;aid hou&s;e containing the following particulars, to wit, a great room. Item, another great room; item, a bigger room; item, another room; item, a va&s;t room; item, a &s;ixth of the &s;ame; a &s;e|venth ditto; an eighth as before; a ninth as above&s;aid; a tenth (&s;ee N^o. 1); item, ten more &s;uch, be&s;ides twenty be&s;ides, which, not to be too particular, we &s;hall pa&s;s over. The &s;aid rooms contain nine chairs, two tables, five &s;tools, and a cricket. From whence we &s;hall proceed to the garden, containing two millions
<PB N="84" REF="87">
of &s;uperfine laurel hedges, a clump of cypre&s;s trees, and half the river Teverone, that pi&s;&s;es into two thou&s;and &s;everal chamber|pots. Finis.&mdash;Dame Nature de&s;ired me to put in a li&s;t of her little goods and chattels, and, as they were &s;mall, to be very minute about them. She has built here three or four little mountains, and laid them out in an irregular &s;emi-circle; from certain others behind, at a greater di&s;tance, &s;he has drawn a canal, into which &s;he has put a little river of her's, called Anio; &s;he has cut a huge cleft between the two innermo&s;t of her four hills, and there &s;he has left it to its own di&s;po&s;al; which &s;he has no &s;ooner done, but, like a heedle&s;s chit, it tumbles headlong down a declivity fifty feet perpendicular, breaks it&s;elf all to &s;hatters, and is converted into a &s;hower of rain, where the &s;un forms many a bow, red, green, blue and yellow. To get out of our metaphors without any further trouble, it is the mo&s;t noble &s;ight in the world. The weight of that quantity of waters, and the force they fall with, have worn the rocks they throw them&s;elves among into a thou&s;and irregular craggs, and to a va&s;t depth. In this channel it goes boiling along with a mighty noi&s;e till it comes to another &s;teep, where you &s;ee it a &s;econd time come roaring down (but fir&s;t you mu&s;t walk two miles farther) a greater height than before, but not with that quantity of waters; for by this time it has divided it&s;elf, being cro&s;&s;ed and oppo&s;ed by the rocks, into four &s;everal &s;treams, each of which, in emulation of the great one, will tumble down too; and it does tumble down, but not from an equally elevated place; &s;o that you have at one view all the&s;e ca&s;cades intermix|ed with groves of olive and little woods, the mountains ri&s;ing behind them, and on the top of one (that which forms the extre|mity of one of the half-circle's horns) is &s;eated the town it&s;elf.
<PB N="85" REF="88">
At the very extremity of that extremity, on the brink of the precipice, &s;tands the Sybils' temple, the remains of a little rotunda, &s;urrounded with its portico, above half of who&s;e beau|tiful Corinthian pillars are &s;till &s;tanding and entire; all this on one hand. On the other, the open Campagna of Rome, here and there a little ca&s;tle on a hillock, and the city it&s;elf on the very brink of the horizon, indi&s;tinctly &s;een (being 18 miles off) except the dome of St. Peter's; which, if you look out of your window, wherever you are, I &s;uppo&s;e, you can &s;ee. I did not tell you that a little below the fir&s;t fall, on the &s;ide of the rock, and hanging over that torrent, are little ruins which they &s;how you for Horace's hou&s;e, a curious &s;ituation to ob&s;erve the
<Q><L>" Praeceps Anio, &amp; Tiburni lucus, &amp; uda</L>

Maecenas did not care for &s;uch a noi&s;e, it &s;eems, and built him a hou&s;e (which they al&s;o carry one to &s;ee) &s;o &s;ituated that it &s;ees nothing at all of the matter, and for any thing he knew there might be no &s;uch river in the world. Horace had another hou&s;e on the other &s;ide of the Teverone, oppo&s;ite to Maecenas's; and they told us there was a bridge of communication, by which <Q REND="inline">"andava il detto Signor per tra&s;tullar&s;i coll i&s;te&s;&s;o Orazio."</Q> In coming hither we cro&s;&s;ed the Aquae Albulae, a vile little brook that &s;tinks like a fury, and they &s;ay it has &s;tunk &s;o the&s;e thou&s;and years. I forgot the Pi&s;cina of Quintilius Varus, where he u&s;ed to keep certain little fi&s;hes. This is very entire, and there is a piece of the aqueduct that &s;upplied it too; in the gar|den below is old Rome, built in little, ju&s;t as it was, they &s;ay. There are &s;even temples in it, and no hou&s;es at all: They &s;ay there were none.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="89">
<HI>May</HI> 21.</P>
<P>We have had the plea&s;ure of going twelve miles out of our way to Pale&s;trina. It has rained all day as if heaven and us were coming together. See my hone&s;ty, I do not mention a &s;yllable of the temple of Fortune, becau&s;e I really did not &s;ee it; which, I think, is pretty well for an old traveller. So we returned along the Via Praene&s;tina, &s;aw the Lacus Gabinus and Regillus, where, you know, Ca&s;tor and Pollux appeared upon a certain occa&s;ion. And many a good old tomb we left on each hand, and many an Aqueduct,</P>
<P>Dumb are who&s;e fountains, and their channels dry.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, two whole modern ones, works of Popes, that run about thirty miles a-piece in length; one of them con|veys &s;till the famous Aqua Virgo to Rome, and adds va&s;t beauty to the pro&s;pect. So we came to Rome again, where waited for us a &s;plendidi&s;&s;imo regalo of letters; in one of which came You, with your huge characters and wide intervals, &s;ta|ring. I would have you to know, I expect you &s;hould take a hand&s;ome crow-quill when you write to me, and not leave room for a pin's point in four &s;ides of a &s;heet royal. Do you but find matter, I will find &s;pectacles.</P>
<P>I have more time than I thought, and I will employ it in telling you about a Ball that we were at the other evening. Figure to your&s;elf a Roman villa; all its little apartments thrown open, and lighted up to the be&s;t advantage. At the upper end of the gallery, a fine concert, in which La Dia|mantina, a famous virtuo&s;a, played on the violin divinely, and &s;ung angelically; Giovannino and Pa&s;qualini (great names in mu&s;ical &s;tory) al&s;o performed miraculou&s;ly. On each &s;ide were

ranged all the &s;ecular grand monde of Rome, the Amba&s;&s;a|dors, Prince&s;&s;es, and all that. Among the re&s;t Il Sereni&s;&s;imo Pretendente (as the Mantova gazette calls him) di&s;played his rueful length of per&s;on, with his two young ones, and all his mini&s;try around him. <Q REND="inline">"Poi nacque un grazio&s;o ballo,"</Q> where the world danced, and I &s;at in a corner regaling my&s;elf with iced fruits, and other plea&s;ant rinfre&s;catives.</P>

<P>I am to day ju&s;t returned from Alba, a good deal fatigued; for you know the Appian is &s;omewhat tire&s;ome.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However whim&s;ical this humour may appear to &s;ome readers, I cho&s;e to in|&s;ert it, as it gives me an opportunity of remarking that Mr. Gray was extreamly &s;killed in the cu&s;toms of the ancient Romans; and has catalogued, in his common place book, their various eatables, wines, perfumes, cloaths, medicines, &amp;c. with great preci&s;ion, referring under every article to pa&s;&s;ages in the Poets and Hi&s;to|rians where their names are mentioned.</NOTE> We dined at
<PB N="89" REF="92">
Pompey's; he indeed was gone for a few days to his Tu&s;culan, but, by the care of his Villicus, we made an admirable meal. We had the dugs of a pregnant &s;ow, a peacock, a di&s;h of thru&s;hes, a noble &s;carus ju&s;t fre&s;h from the Tyrrhene, and &s;ome conchylia of the Lake with garum &s;auce: For my part I never eat better at Lucullus's table. We drank half a dozen cyathi a-piece of ancient Alban to Pholo&euml;'s health; and, after bathing, and playing an hour at ball, we mounted our e&s;&s;edum again, and proceeded up the mount to the temple. The prie&s;ts there entertained us with an account of a wonderful &s;hower of birds eggs, that had fallen two days before, which had no &s;ooner touched the ground, but they were converted into gud|geons; as al&s;o that the night pa&s;t a dreadful voice had been heard out of the Adytum, which &s;poke Greek during a full half hour, but no body under&s;tood it. But quitting my Romanities, to your great joy and mine, let me tell you, in plain Engli&s;h, that we come from Albano. The pre&s;ent town lies within the inclo&s;ure of Pompey's Villa in ruins. The Appian way runs through it, by the &s;ide of which, a little far|ther, is a large old tomb, with five pyramids upon it, which the learned &s;uppo&s;e to be the burying-place of the family, be|cau&s;e they do not know who&s;e it can be el&s;e. But the vulgar a&s;&s;ure you it is the &s;epulchre of the Curiatii, and by that name (&s;uch is their power) it goes. One drives to Ca&s;tel Gondolfo, a hou&s;e of the Pope's, &s;ituated on the top of one of the Colli|nette, that forms a brim to the ba&s;on, commonly called the
<PB N="90" REF="93">
Alban lake. It is &s;even miles round; and directly oppo&s;ite-to you, on the other &s;ide, ri&s;es the Mons Albanus, much taller than the re&s;t, along who&s;e &s;ide are &s;till di&s;coverable (not to common eyes) certain little ruins of the old Alba longa. They had need be very little, as having been nothing but ruins ever &s;ince the days of Tullus Ho&s;tilius. On its top is a hou&s;e of the Con&s;table Collona's, where &s;tood the temple of Jupiter Latialis. At the foot of the hill Gondolfo, are the famous outlets of the lake, built with hewn &s;tone, a mile and a half under ground. Livy, you know, amply informs us of the fooli&s;h occa&s;ion of this expence, and gives me this opportunity of di&s;playing all my erudition, that I may appear con&s;iderable in your eyes. This is the pro&s;pect from one window of the palace. From another you have the whole Campagna, the City, Antium, and the Tyrrene &s;ea (twelve miles di&s;tant) &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hable, that you may &s;ee the ve&s;&s;els &s;ailing upon it. All this is charming. Mr. Walpole &s;ays, our memory &s;ees more than our eyes in this country. Which is extremely true; &s;ince, for realities, Wind&s;or, or Richmond Hill, is infinitely prefer|able to Albano or Fre&s;cati. I am now at home, and going to the window to tell you it is the mo&s;t beautiful of Italian nights, which, in truth, are but ju&s;t begun (&s;o backward has the &s;pring been here, and every where el&s;e, they &s;ay). There is a moon! there are &s;tars for you! Do not you hear the foun|tain? Do not you &s;mell the orange flowers? That building yonder is the Convent of S. I&s;idore; and that eminence, with the cypre&s;s trees and pines upon it, the top of M. Quirinal. This is all true, and yet my pro&s;pect is not two hundred yards in length.

But as the&s;e papers are apparently only memorandums for his own u&s;e, I do not think it nece&s;|&s;ary to print them, although they abound with many uncommon remarks, and pertinent cla&s;&s;ical quotations. The reader will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve throughout this &s;ection, that it is not my intention to give him Mr. Gray's Travels, but only ex|tracts from the Letters which he writ during his travels.</NOTE>. The &s;ea&s;on has hitherto been ju&s;t as warm as one would wi&s;h it; no unwhole&s;ome airs, or violent heats, yet heard of: The people call it a backward year, and are in pain about their corn, wine, and oil; but we, who are neither corn, wine, nor oil,
<PB N="93" REF="96">
find it very agreeable. Our road was through Velletri, Ci&s;ter|na, Terracina, Capua, and Aver&s;a, and &s;o to Naples. The minute one leaves his Holine&s;s's dominions, the face of things begins to change from wide uncultivated plains to olive groves and well|tilled fields of corn, intermixed with ranks of elms, every one of which has its vine twining about it, and hanging in fe&s;toons be|tween the rows from one tree to another. The great old fig|trees, the oranges in full bloom, and myrtles in every hedge, make one of the delightfulle&s;t &s;cenes you can conceive; be&s;ides that, the roads are wide, well-kept, and full of pa&s;&s;engers, a &s;ight I have not beheld this long time. My wonder &s;till increa|&s;ed upon entering the city, which I think, for number of people, outdoes both Paris and London. The &s;treets are one continued market, and thronged with populace &s;o much that a coach can hardly pa&s;s. The common &s;ort are a jolly lively kind of ani|mals, more indu&s;trious than Italians u&s;ually are; they work till evening; then they take their lute or guitar (for they all play) and walk about the city, or upon the &s;ea-&s;hore with it, to enjoy the fre&s;co. One &s;ees their little brown children jumping about &s;tark-naked, and the bigger ones dancing with ca&s;tanets, while others play on the cymbal to them. Your maps will &s;how you the &s;ituation of Naples; it is on the mo&s;t lovely bay in the world, and one of the calme&s;t &s;eas: It has many other beauties be&s;ides tho&s;e of nature. We have &s;pent two days in vi&s;iting the remarkable places in the country round it, &s;uch as the bay of Baiae, and its remains of antiquity; the lake Avernus, and the Solfatara, Charon's grotto, &amp;c. We have been in the Sybils' cave and many other &s;trange holes under|ground (I only name them, becau&s;e you may con&s;ult Sandy's

travels); but the &s;trange&s;t hole I ever was in, has been to-day at a place called Portici, where his Sicilian Maje&s;ty has a coun|try-&s;eat. About a year ago, as they were digging, they di&s;co|vered &s;ome parts of ancient buildings above thirty feet deep in the ground: Curio&s;ity led them on, and they have been dig|ging ever &s;ince; the pa&s;&s;age they have made, with all its turnings and windings, is now more than a mile long. As you walk, you &s;ee parts of an amphitheatre, many hou&s;es adorned with marble columns, and incru&s;ted with the &s;ame; the front of a temple, &s;everal arched vaults of rooms painted in fre&s;co. Some pieces of painting have been taken out from hence, finer than any thing of the kind before di&s;covered, and with the&s;e the King has adorned his palace; al&s;o a number of &s;tatues, medals, and gems; and more are dug out every day. This is known to be a Roman town<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;hould &s;eem by the omi&s;&s;ion of its name, that it was not then di&s;covered to be Herculaneum.</NOTE>, that in the Emperor Titus's time was over|whelmed by a furious eruption of Mount Ve&s;uvius, which is hard by. The wood and beams remain &s;o perfect that you may &s;ee the grain; but burnt to a coal, and dropping into du&s;t upon the lea&s;t touch. We were to-day at the foot of that mountain, which at pre&s;ent only &s;mokes a little, where we &s;aw the mate|rials that fed the &s;tream of fire, which about four years &s;ince ran down its &s;ide.

<P>AT my return to this city, the day before ye&s;terday, I had the plea&s;ure of finding yours dated June the 9th. The period of our voyages, at lea&s;t towards the &s;outh, is come, as you wi&s;h. We have been at Naples, &s;pent nine or ten days there, and returned to Rome, where finding no likelihood of a Pope yet the&s;e three months, and quite wearied with the formal a&s;&s;emblies, and little &s;ociety of that great city, Mr. Walpole determined to return hither to &s;pend the &s;ummer, where he imagines he &s;hall pa&s;s his time more agreeably than in the te|dious expectation of what, when it happens, will only be a great &s;how. For my own part, I give up the thoughts of all that with but little regret; but the city it&s;elf I do not part with &s;o ea&s;ily, which alone has amu&s;ements for whole years. How|ever, I have pa&s;&s;ed through all that mo&s;t people do, both ancient and modern; what that is you may &s;ee, better than I can tell you, in a thou&s;and books. The Conclave we left in greater uncertainty than ever; the more than ordinary liberty they en|joy there, and the unu&s;ual coolne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, makes the confinement le&s;s di&s;agreeable to them than common, and, con|&s;equently, maintains them in their irre&s;olution. There have been very high words, one or two (it is &s;aid) have come even to blows; two more are dead within this la&s;t month, Cenci and Portia; the latter died di&s;tracted; and we left another (Altieri) at the extremity: Yet nobody dreams of an election till the
<PB N="96" REF="99">
latter end of September. All this gives great &s;candal to all good catholics, and every body talks very freely on the &s;ubject. The Pretender (whom you de&s;ire an account of) I have had frequent opportunities of &s;eeing at church, at the cor&s;o, and other places; but more particularly, and that for a whole night, at a great ball given by Count Patrizii to the Prince and Prin|ce&s;s Craon, (who were come to Rome at that time, that he might receive from the hands of the Emperor's mini&s;ter there the order of the golden fleece) at which he and his two &s;ons were pre&s;ent. They are good fine boys, e&s;pecially the younger, who has the more &s;pirit of the two, and both danced ince&s;&s;antly all night long. For him, he is a thin ill-made man, extremely tall and aukward, of a mo&s;t unpromi&s;ing countenance, a good deal re&s;embling King James the Second, and has extremely the air and look of an idiot, particularly when he laughs or prays. The fir&s;t he does not often, the latter continually. He lives private enough with his little court about him, con&s;i&s;ting of Lord Dunbar, who manages every thing, and two or three of the Pre&s;ton Scotch Lords, who would be very glad to make their peace at home.</P>
<P>We happened to be at Naples on Corpus Chri&s;ti Day, the greate&s;t fea&s;t in the year, &s;o had an opportunity of &s;eeing their Sicilian Maje&s;ties to advantage. The King walked in the grand proce&s;&s;ion, and the Queen (being big with child) &s;at in a bal|cony. He followed the Ho&s;t to the church of St. Clara, where high ma&s;s was celebrated to a glorious concert of mu&s;ic. They are as ugly a little pair as one can &s;ee: She a pale girl, marked with the &s;mall-pox; and he a brown boy with a thin face, a huge no&s;e, and as ungain as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="100">
We are &s;ettled here with Mr. Mann in a charming apartment; the river Arno runs under our windows, which we can fi&s;h out of. The &s;ky is &s;o &s;erene, and the air &s;o temperate, that one continues in the open air all night long in a &s;light nightgown without any danger; and the marble bridge is the re&s;ort of every body, where they hear mu&s;ic, eat iced fruits, and &s;up by moon-light; though as yet (the &s;ea&s;on being extremely back|ward every where) the&s;e amu&s;ements are not begun. You &s;ee we are now coming northward again, though in no great ha&s;te; the Venetian and Milane&s;e territories, and either Germany or the South of France, (according to the turn the war may take) are all that remain for us, that we have not yet &s;een; as to Lo|retto, and that part of Italy, we have given over all thoughts of it.</P>

<P>I Lived at the Temple till I was &s;ick of it: I have ju&s;t left it, and find my&s;elf as much a lawyer as I was when I was in it. It is certain, at lea&s;t, I may &s;tudy the law here as well as I could there. My being in chambers did not &s;ignify to me a pinch of &s;nuff. They tell me my father was a lawyer, and, as you know, eminent in the profe&s;&s;ion; and &s;uch a circum&s;tance mu&s;t be of advantage to me. My uncle too makes &s;ome figure in We&s;tmin&s;ter hall; and there's another advantage: Then my

grandfather's name would get me many friends. Is it not &s;trange that a young fellow, that might enter the world with &s;o many advantages, will not know his own intere&s;t? &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;What &s;hall I &s;ay in an&s;wer to all this? For money, I neither doat upon it nor de&s;pi&s;e it; it is a nece&s;&s;ary &s;tuff enough. For ambition, I do not want that neither; but it is not to &s;it upon a bench. In &s;hort, is it not a di&s;agreeable thing to force one's inclination, e&s;pecially when one's young? not to mention that one ought to have the &s;trength of a Hercules to go through our common law; which, I am afraid, I have not. Well! but then, &s;ay they, if one profe&s;&s;ion does not &s;uit you, you may choo&s;e another more to your inclination. Now I prote&s;t I do not yet know my own inclination, and I believe, if that was to be my direction, I &s;hould never fix at all: There is no going by a weathercock.&mdash;I could &s;ay much more upon this &s;ubject; but there is no talking t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te cro&s;s the Alps. O the folly of young men, that never know their own intere&s;t! they never grow wi&s;e till they are ruined! and then nobody pities them, nor helps them. Dear Gray! con&s;ider me in the condition of one that has lived the&s;e two years without any per&s;on that he can &s;peak freely to. I know it is very &s;eldom that people trouble them&s;elves with the &s;entiments of tho&s;e they conver&s;e with; &s;o they can chat about trifles, they never care whether your heart aches or no. Are you one of the&s;e? I think not. But what right have I to a&s;k you this que&s;tion? Have we known one another enough, that I &s;hould expect or demand &s;incerity from you? Yes, Gray, I hope we have; and I have not quite &s;uch a mean opinion of my&s;elf, as to think I do not de&s;erve it.&mdash;But, Signor, is it not time for me to a&s;k &s;ome|thing about your further intentions abroad?

<P>YOU do your&s;elf and me ju&s;tice, in imagining that you me|rit, and that I am capable of &s;incerity. I have not a thought, or even a weakne&s;s, I de&s;ire to conceal from you; and con&s;equently on my &s;ide de&s;erve to be treated with the &s;ame openne&s;s of heart. My vanity perhaps might make me more re&s;erved towards you, if you were one of the heroic race, &s;uperior to all human failings; but as mutual wants are the ties of general &s;ociety, &s;o are mutual weakne&s;&s;es of private friend|&s;hips, &s;uppo&s;ing them mixt with &s;ome proportion of good qua|lities; for where one may not &s;ometimes blame, one does not much care ever to prai&s;e. All this has the air of an in|troduction de&s;igned to &s;often a very har&s;h reproof that is to fol|low; but it is no &s;uch matter: I only meant to a&s;k, Why did
<PB N="100" REF="103">
you change your lodging? Was the air bad, or the &s;ituation melancholy? If &s;o, you are quite in the right. Only, is it not putting your&s;elf a little out of the way of a people, with whom it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to keep up &s;ome &s;ort of intercour&s;e and con|ver&s;ation, though but little for your plea&s;ure or entertainment, (yet there are, I believe, &s;uch among them as might give you both) at lea&s;t for your information in that &s;tudy, which, when I left you, you thought of applying to? for that there is a cer|tain &s;tudy nece&s;&s;ary to be followed, if we mean to be of any u&s;e in the world, I take for granted; di&s;agreeable enough (as mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ities are) but, I am afraid, unavoidable. Into how many branches the&s;e &s;tudies are divided in England, every body knows; and between that which you and I had pitched upon, and the other two, it was impo&s;&s;ible to balance long. Exam|ples &s;hew one that it is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be a block|head to &s;ucceed in this profe&s;&s;ion. The labour is long, and the elements dry and unentertaining; nor was ever any body (e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e that afterwards made a figure in it) amu&s;ed, or even not di&s;gu&s;ted in the beginning; yet, upon a further ac|quaintance, there is &s;urely matter for curio&s;ity and reflection. It is &s;trange if, among all that huge ma&s;s of words, there be not &s;omewhat intermixed for thought. Laws have been the re&s;ult of long deliberation, and that not of dull men, but the contrary; and have &s;o clo&s;e a connexion with hi&s;tory, nay, with philo&s;ophy it&s;elf, that they mu&s;t partake a little of what they are related to &s;o nearly. Be&s;ides, tell me, Have you ever made the attempt? Was not you frighted merely with the di&s;|tant pro&s;pect? Had the Gothic character and bulkine&s;s of tho&s;e volumes (a tenth part of which perhaps it will be no further nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult, than as one does a dictionary) no ill effect
<PB N="101" REF="104">
upon your eye? Are you &s;ure, if Coke had been printed by El|zevir, and bound in twenty neat pocket volumes, in&s;tead of one folio, you &s;hould never have taken him up for an hour, as you would a Tully, or drank your tea over him? I know how great an ob&s;tacle ill &s;pirits are to re&s;olution. Do you really think, if you rid ten miles every morning, in a week's time you &s;hould not entertain much &s;tronger hopes of the Chancellor&s;hip, and think it a much more probable thing than you do at pre&s;ent? The advantages you mention are not nothing; our inclinations are more than we imagine in our own power; rea&s;on and re|&s;olution determine them, and &s;upport under many difficulties. To me there hardly appears to be any medium between a pub|lic life and a private one; he who prefers the fir&s;t, mu&s;t put him&s;elf in a way of being &s;erviceable to the re&s;t of mankind, if he has a mind to be of any con&s;equence among them: Nay, he mu&s;t not refu&s;e being in a certain degree even dependent upon &s;ome men who already are &s;o. If he has the good fortune to light on &s;uch as will make no ill u&s;e of his humility, there is no &s;hame in this: If not, his ambition ought to give place to a rea&s;onable pride, and he &s;hould apply to the cultivation of his own mind tho&s;e abilities which he has not been permitted to u&s;e for others' &s;ervice. Such a private happine&s;s (&s;uppo&s;ing a &s;mall competence of fortune) is almo&s;t always in one's power, and the proper enjoyment of age, as the other is the employ|ment of youth. You are yet young, have &s;ome advantages and opportunities, and an undoubted capacity, which you have never yet put to the trial. Set apart a few hours, &s;ee how the fir&s;t year will agree with you, at the end of it you are &s;till the ma&s;ter; if you change your mind, you will only have got the knowledge of a little &s;omewhat that can do no hurt, or give you
<PB N="102" REF="105">
cau&s;e of repentance. If your inclination be not fixed upon any thing el&s;e, it is a &s;ymptom that you are not ab&s;olutely deter|mined again&s;t this, and warns you not to mi&s;take mere indo|lence for inability. I am &s;en&s;ible there is nothing &s;tronger again&s;t what I would per&s;uade you to, than my own practice; which may make you imagine I think not as I &s;peak. Alas! it is not &s;o; but I do not act what I think, and I had rather be the object of your pity, than that you &s;hould be that of mine; and, be a&s;&s;ured, the advantage I may receive from it, does not di|mini&s;h my concern in hearing you want &s;omebody to con|ver&s;e with freely, who&s;e advice might be of more weight, and always at hand. We have &s;ome time &s;ince come to the &s;outhern period of our voyages; we &s;pent about nine days at Naples. It is the large&s;t and mo&s;t populous city, as its environs are the mo&s;t deliciou&s;ly fertile country, of all Italy. We &s;ailed in the bay of Baiae, &s;weated in the Solfatara, and died in the grotto del Cane, as all &s;trangers do; &s;aw the Corpus Chri&s;ti proce&s;&s;ion, and the King and the Queen, and the city under|ground, (which is a wonder I re&s;erve to tell you of another time) and &s;o returned to Rome for another fortnight; left it (left Rome!) and came hither for the &s;ummer.

<P>IT is &s;ome time &s;ince I have had the plea&s;ure of writing to you, having been upon a little excur&s;ion cro&s;s the moun|tains to Bologna. We &s;et out from hence at &s;un&s;et, pa&s;&s;ed the Apennines by moon-light, travelling ince&s;&s;antly till we came to Bologna at four in the afternoon next day. There we &s;pent a week agreeably enough, and returned as we came. The day before ye&s;terday arrived the news of a Pope; and I have the mortification of being within four days journey of Rome, and not &s;eeing his coronation, the heats being violent, and the in|fectious air now at its height. We had an in&s;tance, the other day, that it is not only fancy. Two country fellows, &s;trong men, and u&s;ed to the country about Rome, having occa&s;ion to come from thence hither, and travelling on foot, as common with them, one died &s;uddenly on the road; the other got hither, but extremely weak, and in a manner &s;tupid; he was carried to the ho&s;pital, but died in two days. So, between fear and lazine&s;s, we remain here, and mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with the accounts other people give us of the matter. The new Pope is called Benedict XIV. being created Cardinal by Bene|dict XIII. the la&s;t Pope but one. His name is Lambertini, a noble Bologne&s;e, and Archbi&s;hop of that city. When I was fir&s;t there, I remember to have &s;een him two or three times; he is a &s;hort, fat man, about &s;ixty-five years of age, of a hearty, merry countenance, and likely to live &s;ome years. He bears a good character for genero&s;ity, affability, and other virtues; and,
<PB N="104" REF="107">
they &s;ay, wants neither knowledge nor capacity. The wor&s;t &s;ide of him is, that he has a nephew or two; be&s;ides a certain young favourite, called Melara, who is &s;aid to have had, for &s;ome time, the arbitrary di&s;po&s;al of his pur&s;e and family. He is reported to have made a little &s;peech to the Cardinals in the Conclave, while they were undetermined about an election, as follows: <Q REND="inline">"Mo&s;t eminent Lords, here are three Bologne&s;e of dif|ferent characters, but all equally proper for the Popedom. If it be your plea&s;ures, to pitch upon a Saint, there is Cardinal Gotti; if upon a Politician, there is Aldrovandi; if upon a Booby, here am I."</Q> The Italian is much more expre&s;&s;ive, and, indeed, not to be tran&s;lated; wherefore, if you meet with any body that under&s;tands it, you may &s;hew them what he &s;aid in the language he &s;poke it. <Q REND="inline">"Emin^&s;^&s;^i^m^i. Sigr^i. Ci &s;iamo tr&eacute;, diver&s;i si, m&agrave; tutti idonei al Papato.

Cor&s;ini (the late Pope's nephew) as he has had no hand in this election, it is hoped, will be called to account for all his villa|nous practices. The Pretender, they &s;ay, has re&s;igned all his preten&s;ions to his elde&s;t boy, and will accept of the Grand Chancellor&s;hip, which is thirty thou&s;and crowns a-year; the pen&s;ion he has at pre&s;ent is only twenty thou&s;and. I do not affirm the truth of this la&s;t article; becau&s;e, if he does, it is nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould take the eccle&s;ia&s;tical habit, and it will &s;ound mighty odd to be called his Maje&s;ty the Chancellor.&mdash;So ends my Gazette.</P>

In the year of our Lord 1538, on the 29th of September, when for certain days foregoing the country hereabout was &s;o vexed with perpe|tual earthquakes, as no one hou&s;e was left &s;o entire as not to expect an immediate ruin; after that the &s;ea had retired two hundred paces from the &s;hore, (leaving abundance of fi&s;h, and &s;prings of fre&s;h water ri&s;ing in the bottom) this moun|tain vi&s;ibly a&s;cended, about the &s;econd hour of the night, with an hideous roar|ing, horribly vomiting &s;tones and &s;uch &s;tore of cinders as overwhelmed all the building thereabout, and the &s;alubrious baths of Tripergula, for &s;o many ages ce|lebrated; con&s;umed the vines to a&s;hes, killing birds and bea&s;ts: the fearful in|habitants of Puzzol flying through the dark with their wives and children; naked, defiled, crying out, and dete&s;ting their calamities. Manifold mi&s;chiefs have they &s;uffered by the barbarous, yet none like this which Nature inflicted.&mdash;This new mountain, when newly rai&s;ed, had a number of i&s;&s;ues; at &s;ome of them &s;moking and &s;ometimes flaming; at others di&s;gorging rivulets of hot waters; keep|ing within a terrible rumbling; and many mi&s;erably peri&s;hed that ventured to de|&s;cend into the hollowne&s;s above. But that hollow on the top is at pre&s;ent an orchard, and the mountain throughout is bereft of his terrors." <BIBL><HI>Sandy's Travels, book</HI> 4, <HI>page</HI> 275, 277, <HI>and</HI> 278.</BIBL></Q> </NOTE></P>

<P>THE beginning of next &s;pring is the time determined for our return at furthe&s;t; po&s;&s;ibly it may be before that time. How the interim will be employed, or what route we &s;hall take, is not &s;o certain. If we remain friends with France, upon leaving this country we &s;hall cro&s;s over to Venice, and &s;o return through the cities north of the Po to Genoa; from thence take a felucca to Mar&s;eilles, and come back through Paris. If the contrary fall out, which &s;eems not unlikely, we mu&s;t make the Milane&s;e, and tho&s;e parts of Italy, in our way to Ve|nice;
<PB N="110" REF="113">
from thence pa&s;s through the Tirol into Germany, and come home by the Low-Countries. As for Florence, it has been gayer than ordinary for this la&s;t month, being one round of balls and entertainments, occa&s;ioned by the arrival of a great Milane&s;e Lady; for the only thing the Italians &s;hine in, is their reception of &s;trangers. At &s;uch times every thing is magnifi|cence: The more remarkable, as in their ordinary cour&s;e of life they are par&s;imonious, even to a degree of na&s;tine&s;s. I &s;aw in one of the va&s;te&s;t palaces in Rome (that of Prince Pam|filio) the apartment which he him&s;elf inhabited, a bed that mo&s;t &s;ervants in England would di&s;dain to lie in, and furni|ture much like that of a &s;oph at Cambridge, for conveni|ence and neatne&s;s. This man is worth 30,000 l. &s;terling a year. As for eating, there are not two Cardinals in Rome that allow more than &s;ix paoli, which is three &s;hillings a day, for the ex|pence of their table; and you may imagine they are &s;till le&s;s ex|travagant here than there. But when they receive a vi&s;it from any friend, their hou&s;es and per&s;ons are &s;et out to the greate&s;t advantage, and appear in all their &s;plendour; it is, indeed, from a motive of vanity, and with the hopes of having it repaid them with intere&s;t, whenever they have occa&s;ion to return the vi&s;it. I call vi&s;its going from one city of Italy to another; for it is not &s;o among acquaintance of the &s;ame place on common occa&s;ions. The new Pope has retrenched the charges of his own table to a &s;equin (10 s.) a meal. The applau&s;e which all he &s;ays and does meets with, is enough to encourage him really to de&s;erve fame. They &s;ay he is an able and hone&s;t man; he is reckoned a wit too. The other day, when the Senator of Rome came to wait upon him, at the fir&s;t compliments he made him the Pope pulled off his cap: His Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies, who &s;tood by his &s;ide,
<PB N="111" REF="114">
touched him &s;oftly, as to warn him that &s;uch a conde&s;cen&s;ion was too great in him, and out of all manner of rule: Upon which he turned to him and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Oh! I cry you mercy, good Ma&s;ter, it is true, I am but a Novice of a Pope; I have not yet &s;o much as learned ill manners."</Q> ***</P>

<P>WE &s;till continue con&s;tant at Florence, at pre&s;ent one of the dulle&s;t cities in Italy. Though it is the middle of the Carnival there are no public diver&s;ions; nor is ma&s;querading permitted as yet. The Emperor's ob&s;equies are to be celebra|ted publickly the 16th of this month; and after that, it is ima|gined every thing will go on in its u&s;ual cour&s;e. In the mean time, to employ the minds of the populace, the Government has thought fit to bring into the city in a &s;olemn manner, and at a great expence, a famous &s;tatue of the Virgin called the Madonna dell'Impruneta, from the place of her re&s;idence, which is upon a mountain &s;even miles off. It never has been practi&s;ed but at times of public calamity; and was done at pre&s;ent to avert the ill effects of a late great inundation, which it was feared might cau&s;e &s;ome epidemical di&s;temper. It was introduced a
<PB N="112" REF="115">
fortnight ago in proce&s;&s;ion, attended by the Council of Regen|cy, the Senate, the Nobility, and all the Religious Orders, on foot and bare-headed, and &s;o carried to the great church, where it was frequented by an infinite concour&s;e of people from all the country round. Among the re&s;t I paid my devotions almo&s;t every day, and &s;aw numbers of people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the devil, who were brought to be exorci&s;ed. It was indeed in the even|ing, and the church-doors were always &s;hut before the ceremo|nies were fini&s;hed, &s;o that I could not be eye-witne&s;s of the event; but that they were all cured is certain, for one never heard any more of them the next morning. I am to-night ju&s;t returned from &s;eeing our Lady make her exit with the &s;ame &s;o|lemnities &s;he entered. The &s;how had a finer effect than before; for it was dark; and every body (even tho&s;e of the mob that could afford it) bore a white-wax flambeau. I believe there were at lea&s;t five thou&s;and of them, and the march was near three hours in pa&s;&s;ing before the window. The &s;ubject of all this devotion is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a large Tile with a rude figure in bas-relief upon it. I &s;ay &s;uppo&s;ed, becau&s;e &s;ince the time it was found (for it was found in the earth in ploughing) only two people have &s;een it; the one was, by good-luck, a &s;aint; the other was &s;truck blind for his pre&s;umption. Ever &s;ince &s;he has been covered with &s;even veils; neverthele&s;s, tho&s;e who approach her tabernacle ca&s;t their eyes down, for fear they &s;hould &s;py her through all her veils. Such is the hi&s;tory, as I had it from the Lady of the hou&s;e where I &s;tood to &s;ee her pa&s;s; with many other circum&s;tances; all which &s;he firmly believes, and ten thou&s;and be&s;ide.</P>

We &s;hall go to Venice in about &s;ix weeks, or &s;ooner. A number of German troops are upon their march into this State, in ca&s;e the King of Naples thinks proper to attack it. It is cer|tain he has a&s;ked the Pope's leave for his troops to pa&s;s through his country. The Tu&s;cans in general are much di&s;contented, and fooli&s;h enough to wi&s;h for a Spani&s;h government, or any rather than this. ****</P>

<P>I Know not what degree of &s;atisfaction it will give you to be told that we &s;hall &s;et out from hence the 24th of this month, and not &s;top above a fortnight at any place in our way. This I feel, that you are the principal plea&s;ure I have to hope for in my own country. Try at lea&s;t to make me imagine my&s;elf not indifferent to you; for I mu&s;t own I have the vanity of de&s;iring to be e&s;teemed by &s;omebody, and would choo&s;e that &s;omebody &s;hould be one whom I e&s;teem as much as I do you. As I am recommending my&s;elf to your love, methinks I ought to &s;end you my picture (for I am no more what I was, &s;ome circum|&s;tances excepted, which I hope I need not particularize to you); you mu&s;t add then, to your former idea, two years of age, a rea&s;onable quantity of dullne&s;s, a great deal of &s;ilence, and &s;omething that rather re&s;embles, than is, thinking; a con|fu&s;ed notion of many &s;trange and fine things that have &s;wum before my eyes for &s;ome time, a want of love for general &s;ocie|ty,
<PB N="114" REF="117">
indeed an inability to it. On the good &s;ide you may add a &s;en&s;ibility for what others feel, and indulgence for their faults or weakne&s;&s;es, a love of truth, and dete&s;tation of every thing el&s;e. Then you are to deduct a little impertinence, a little laughter, a great deal of pride, and &s;ome &s;pirits. The&s;e are all the alte|rations I know of, you perhaps may find more. Think not that I have been obliged for this reformation of manners to rea&s;on or reflection, but to a &s;everer &s;chool-mi&s;tre&s;s, Expe|rience. One has little merit in learning her le&s;&s;ons, for one cannot well help it; but they are more u&s;eful than others, and imprint them&s;elves in the very heart. I find I have been ha|ranguing in the &s;tyle of the Son of Sirach, &s;o &s;hall fini&s;h here, and tell you that our route is &s;ettled as follows: Fir&s;t to Bo|logna for a few days, to hear the Vi&s;contina &s;ing; next to Reggio, where is a Fair. Now, you mu&s;t know, a Fair here is not a place where one eats gingerbread or rides upon hobby|hor&s;es; here are no mu&s;ical clocks, nor tall Leice&s;ter&s;hire wo|men; one has nothing but ma&s;quing, gaming, and &s;inging. If you love operas, there will be the mo&s;t &s;plendid in Italy, four tip-top voices, a new theatre, the Duke and Dutche&s;s in all their pomps and vanities. Does not this &s;ound magnificent? Yet is the city of Reggio but one &s;tep above Old Brentford. Well; next to Venice by the 11th of May, there to &s;ee the old Doge wed the Adriatic Whore. Then to Verona, &s;o to Milan, &s;o to Mar&s;eilles, &s;o to Lyons, &s;o to Paris, &s;o to We&s;t, &amp;c. in &s;aecula &s;aeculorum. Amen.</P>

<P>WHEN Mr. Gray returned from abroad, he found his Father's con&s;titution almo&s;t entirely worn out by the very &s;evere attacks of the gout, to which he had been for many years &s;ubject; and indeed the next return of that di&s;temper was fatal to him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He came to Town about the 1&s;t of September, 1741. His Father died the 6th of November following, at the age of &s;ixty-five.</NOTE> This happened about two months after his &s;on reached London.</P>
<P>It has been before ob&s;erved, that Mr. Philip Gray was of a re&s;erved and indolent temper; he was al&s;o moro&s;e, un&s;ocial, and ob&s;tinate; defects which, if not inherent in his di&s;po&s;ition, might probably ari&s;e from his bodily complaints. His indo|lence had led him to neglect the bu&s;ine&s;s of <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">His bu&s;ine&s;s was that which at the time was called a Money-Scrivener; and it may not be ami&s;s to mention, for the &s;ingularity of the thing, that Mil|ton's father was of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion: But he al&s;o had <Q REND="inline">"Mu&s;ic in his &s;oul,"</Q> and was e&s;teemed a con&s;iderable ma&s;ter in that &s;cience. Some of his compo&s;itions are extant in Old Wilby's Set of Airs, and in Raven&s;croft's P&s;alms. The great Poet alludes finely both to the mu&s;ical genius and the trade of his father in tho&s;e beau|tiful hexameters, <Q REND="inline">"Ad Patrem,"</Q> which are in&s;erted among&s;t his Latin Poems.</NOTE>his profe&s;&s;ion; his ob&s;tinacy, to build a country-hou&s;e at Wan&s;tead, without acquainting either his wife or &s;on with the de&s;ign (to which he knew they would be very aver&s;e) till it was executed. This building, which he undertook late in life, was attended with very con&s;iderable expence; which might almo&s;t be called
<PB N="120" REF="123">
&s;o much money thrown away: &s;ince, after his death, the hou&s;e was obliged to be &s;old for two thou&s;and pounds le&s;s than its ori|ginal co&s;t. Mr. Gray, therefore, at this time found his patri|mony &s;o &s;mall, that it would by no means enable him to pro&s;e|cute the &s;tudy of the law, without his becoming burthen&s;ome to his Mother and Aunt. The&s;e two &s;i&s;ters had for many years carried on <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">They kept a kind of India warehou&s;e on Cornhill under the joint names of Gray and Antrobus.</NOTE>a trade &s;eparate from that of Mrs. Gray's hu&s;band; by which having acquired what would &s;upport them decently for the re&s;t of their lives, they left off bu&s;i|ne&s;s &s;oon after his death, and retired to Stoke, near Wind&s;or, to the hou&s;e of their other Si&s;ter, Mrs. Rogers, lately become the widow of a clergyman of that name. Both of them wi&s;hed Mr. Gray to follow the profe&s;&s;ion for which he had been originally intended, and would undoubtedly have contri|buted all in their power to enable him to do it with ea&s;e and conveniency. He on his part, though he had taken his re&s;o|lution of declining it, was too delicate to hurt two per&s;ons for whom he had &s;o tender an affection, by peremptorily declaring his real intentions; and therefore changed, or pretended to change, the line of that &s;tudy; and, accordingly, the latter end of the &s;ub&s;equent year went to Cambridge to take his Ba|chelor's Degree in Civil Law.</P>
<P>But the narrowne&s;s of his circum&s;tances was not the only thing that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him at this period. He had, as we have &s;een, lo&s;t the friend&s;hip of Mr. Walpole abroad. He had al&s;o lo&s;t much time in his travels; a lo&s;s which appli|cation could not ea&s;ily retrieve, when &s;o &s;evere and laborious a

&s;tudy as that of the Common Law was to be the object of it; and he well knew that, whatever improvement he might have made in this interval, either in ta&s;te or &s;cience, &s;uch improvement would &s;tand him in little &s;tead with regard to his pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion and exigencies. This was not all: His other friend, Mr. We&s;t, he found, on his return, oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;ickne&s;s and a load of family misfortunes; which, were I fully acquainted with them, it would not be my inclination here to dwell upon. The&s;e the &s;ympathizing heart of Mr. Gray made his own. He did all in his power (for he was now with him in Lon|don) to &s;oothe the &s;orrows of his friend, and to try to alleviate them by every office of the pure&s;t and mo&s;t perfect affection: But his cares were vain. The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Mr. We&s;t's mind had already too far affected a body, from the fir&s;t, weak and delicate. His health declined daily, and, therefore, he left Town in March 1742, and, for the benefit of the air, went to David Mitchell's, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> at Popes, near Hatfield, Hertford|&s;hire; at who&s;e hou&s;e he died the 1&s;t of June following.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. GRAY to Mr. WEST.</HEAD>
<P>I Tru&s;t to the country, and that ea&s;y indolence you &s;ay you enjoy there, to re&s;tore you your health and &s;pirits; and doubt not but, when the &s;un grows warm enough to tempt you from your fire-&s;ide, you will (like all other things) be the better for his influence. He is my old friend, and an excellent nur&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you. Had it not been for him, life had often been to me intolerable. Pray do not imagine that Tacitus, of all au|thors in the world, can be tedious. An annali&s;t, you know, is by no means ma&s;ter of his &s;ubject; and I think one may venture to &s;ay, that if tho&s;e Pannonian affairs are tedious in his hands, in another's they would have been in&s;upportable. However, fear not, they will &s;oon be over, and he will make ample amends. A man, who could join the <HI>brilliant</HI> of wit and conci&s;e &s;ententiou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="123" REF="126">
peculiar to that age, with the truth and gravity of better times, and the deep reflection and good &s;en&s;e of the be&s;t mo|derns, cannot choo&s;e but have &s;omething to &s;trike you. Yet what I admire in him above all this, is his dete&s;tation of tyran|ny, and the high &s;pirit of liberty that every now and then breaks out, as it were, whether he would or no. I remember a &s;entence in his Agricola that (conci&s;e as it is) I always admi|red for &s;aying much in a little compa&s;s. He &s;peaks of Domi|tian, who upon &s;eeing the la&s;t will of that General, where he had made him Coheir with his Wife and Daughter, <Q REND="inline">"Satis con&s;tabat laetatum eum, velut honore, judicioque: tam caeca &amp; corrupta mens a&s;&s;iduis adulationibus erat, ut ne&s;ciret a bono patre non &s;cribi haeredem, ni&s;i malum principem."</Q></P>
<P>As to the Dunciad it is greatly admired: The Genii of Ope|ras and Schools, with their attendants, the pleas of the Virtu|o&s;os and Flori&s;ts, and the yawn of dullne&s;s in the end, are as fine as any thing he has written. The Metaphy&s;icians' part is to me the wor&s;t; and here and there a few ill-expre&s;&s;ed lines, and &s;ome hardly intelligible.</P>
<P>I take the liberty of &s;ending you a long &s;peech of Agrippina; much too long, but I could be glad you would retrench it. Aceronia, you may remember, had been giving quiet coun&s;els. I fancy, if it ever be fini&s;hed, it will be in the nature of Nat. Lee's Bedlam Tragedy, which had twenty-five acts and &s;ome odd &s;cenes.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="124" REF="127">
The &s;peech herewith &s;ent to Mr. We&s;t was the concluding one of the fir&s;t &s;cene of a tragedy, which I believe was begun the preceding winter. The Britannicus of M. Racine, I know was one of Mr. Gray's mo&s;t favourite plays; and the admi|rable manner in which I have heard him &s;ay that he &s;aw it repre&s;ented at Paris, &s;eems to have led him to choo&s;e the death of Agrippina for this his fir&s;t and only effort in the drama. The execution of it al&s;o, as far as it goes, is &s;o very much in Racine's ta&s;te, that I &s;u&s;pect, if that great poet had been born an Engli&s;hman, he would have written preci&s;ely in the &s;ame &s;tyle and manner. However, as there is at pre&s;ent in this nation a general prejudice again&s;t declamatory plays, I agree with a learned friend, who peru&s;ed the manu&s;cript, that this fragment will be little reli&s;hed by the many; yet the admirable &s;trokes of nature and character with which it abounds, and the maje&s;ty of its diction, prevent me from withholding from the few, who I expect will reli&s;h it, &s;o great a curio&s;ity (to call it nothing more) as part of a tragedy written by Mr. Gray. The&s;e per&s;ons well know, that till &s;tyle and &s;entiment be a little more regarded, mere action and pa&s;&s;ion will never &s;ecure reputation to the Author, whatever they may do to the Actor. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the one <Q REND="inline">"to &s;trut and fret his hour upon the &s;tage;"</Q> and if he frets and &s;truts enough, he is &s;ure to find his reward in the plaudit of an upper gallery; but the other ought to have &s;ome regard to the cooler judgment of the clo&s;et: For I will be bold to &s;ay, that if Shake&s;pear him|&s;elf had not written a multitude of pa&s;&s;ages which plea&s;e there as much as they do on the &s;tage, his reputation would not &s;tand &s;o univer&s;ally high as it does at pre&s;ent. Many of the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages, to the &s;hame of our theatrical ta&s;te, are omitted con|&s;tantly
<PB N="125" REF="128">
in the repre&s;entation: But I &s;ay not this from convic|tion that the mode of writing, which Mr. Gray pur&s;ued, is the be&s;t for dramatic purpo&s;es. I think my&s;elf, what I have a&s;|&s;erted el&s;ewhere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letters prefixt to Elfrida, particularly Letter II.</NOTE>, that a medium between the French and Engli&s;h ta&s;te would be preferable to either; and yet this me|dium, if hit with the greate&s;t nicety, would fail of &s;ucce&s;s on our theatre, and that for a very obvious rea&s;on. Actors (I &s;peak of the troop collectively) mu&s;t all learn to &s;peak as well as act, in order to do ju&s;tice to &s;uch a drama.</P>
<P>But let me ha&s;ten to give the reader what little in&s;ight I can into Mr. Gray's plan, as I find, and &s;elect it from two detached papers. The Title and Dramatis Per&s;onae are as follow:

<P><PB N="126" REF="129">
The argument drawn out by him, in the&s;e two papers, under the idea of a plot and under-plot, I &s;hall here unite; as it will tend to &s;how that the action it&s;elf was po&s;&s;e&s;t of &s;ufficient unity.</P>
<P>The drama opens with the indignation of Agrippina, at re|ceiving her &s;on's orders from Anicetus to remove from Baiae, and to have her guard taken from her. At this time Otho ha|ving conveyed Poppaea from the hou&s;e of her hu&s;band Rufus Cri&s;pinus, brings her to Baiae, where he means to conceal her among the croud; or, if his fraud is di&s;covered, to have re|cour&s;e to the Emperor's authority; but, knowing the lawle&s;s temper of Nero, he determines not to have recour&s;e to that expedient, but on the utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity. In the meantime he commits her to the care of Anicetus, whom he takes to be his friend, and in who&s;e age he thinks he may &s;afely confide. Nero is not yet come to Baiae; but Seneca, whom he &s;ends before him, informs Agrippina of the accu&s;ation concerning Rubellius Plan|cus, and de&s;ires her to clear her&s;elf, which &s;he does briefly; but demands to &s;ee her &s;on, who, on his arrival, acquits her of all &s;u&s;picion, and re&s;tores her to her honours In the meanwhile Anicetus, to who&s;e care Poppaea had been entru&s;ted by Otho, contrives the following plot to ruin Agrippina: He betrays his tru&s;t to Otho, and brings Nero, as it were by chance, to the &s;ight of the beautiful Poppaea; the Emperor is immediately &s;truck with her charms, and &s;he, by a feigned re&s;i&s;tance, in|crea&s;es his pa&s;&s;ion; tho', in reality, &s;he is from the fir&s;t dazzled with the pro&s;pect of empire, and forgets Otho: She therefore joins with Anicetus in his de&s;ign of ruining Agrippina, &s;oon perceiving that it will be for her intere&s;t. Otho hearing that
<PB N="127" REF="130">
the Emperor had &s;een Poppaea, is much enraged; but not knowing that this interview was obtained thro' the treachery of Anicetus, is readily per&s;uaded by him to &s;ee Agrippina in &s;ecret, and acquaint her with his fears that her &s;on Nero would marry Poppaea. Agrippina, to &s;upport her own power, and to wean the Emperor from the love of Poppaea, gives Otho encouragement, and promi&s;es to &s;upport him. Ani|cetus &s;ecretly introduces Nero to hear their di&s;cour&s;e; who re&s;olves immediately on his mother's death, and, by Anicetus's means, to de&s;troy her by drowning. A &s;olemn fea&s;t, in honour of their reconciliation, is to be made; after which &s;he being to go by &s;ea to Bauli, the &s;hip is &s;o contrived as to &s;ink or cru&s;h her; &s;he e&s;capes by accident, and returns to Baiae. In this interval, Otho has an interview with Poppaea; and being duped a &s;econd time by Anicetus and her, determines to fly with her into Greece, by means of a ve&s;&s;el which is to be furni&s;hed by Anicetus; but he, pretending to remove Poppaea on board in the night, conveys her to Nero's apartment: She there encourages and determines Nero to bani&s;h Otho, and fini&s;h the horrid deed he had attempted on his mother. Ani|cetus undertakes to execute his re&s;olves; and, under pretence of a plot upon the Emperor's life, is &s;ent with a guard to murder Agrippina, who is &s;till at Baiae in imminent fear, and irre&s;olute how to conduct her&s;elf. The account of her death, and the Emperor's horrour and fruitle&s;s remor&s;e, fini&s;hes the drama.</P>
<P>I refer the reader to the 13th and 14th books of the annals of Tacitus for the facts on which this &s;tory is founded: By turning to that author, he will ea&s;ily &s;ee how far the poet thought it nece&s;&s;ary to deviate from the truth of hi&s;tory. I
<PB N="128" REF="131">
&s;hall only further ob&s;erve, that as &s;uch a fable could not po&s;&s;ibly admit of any good character, it is terror only and not pity that could be excited by this tragedy, had it been completed. Yet it was &s;urely capable of exciting this pa&s;&s;ion in a &s;upreme degree; if, what the critics tell us be true, that crimes, which illu&s;trious per&s;ons commit, affect us from the very circum&s;tance of their rank, becau&s;e we unite with that our fears for the public weal.</P>

<P>I Own in general I think Agrippina's &s;peech too long<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor has obviated this objection, not by retrenching, but by putting part of it into the mouth of Aceronia, and by breaking it in a few other places. Originally it was one continued &s;peech from the line <Q REND="inline">"Thus ever grave and undi&s;turbed Reflection"</Q> to the end of the &s;cene; which was undoubtedly too long for the lungs of any Actre&s;s.</NOTE>; but how to retrench it, I know not: But I have &s;omething el&s;e to &s;ay, and that is in relation to the &s;tyle, which appears to me too antiquated. Racine was of another opinion; he no where gives you the phra&s;es of Ron&s;ard: His language is the language of the times, and that of the pure&s;t &s;ort; &s;o that his French is reckoned a &s;tandard. I will not decide what &s;tyle is fit for our Engli&s;h &s;tage; but I &s;hould rather choo&s;e one that bordered up|on Cato, than upon Shake&s;pear. One may imitate (if one can) Shake&s;pear's manner, his &s;urprizing &s;trokes of true nature, his expre&s;&s;ive force in painting characters, and all his other beauties; pre&s;erving at the &s;ame time our own language. Were Shake|&s;pear alive now, he would write a different &s;tyle from what he did. The&s;e are my &s;entiments upon the&s;e matters: Perhaps I am wrong, for I am neither a Tarpa, nor am I quite an Ari&s;tar|chus. You &s;ee I write freely both of you and Shake&s;pear; but it is as good as writing not freely, where you know it is accept|able.</P>

after cough, &s;haking and tearing me for half an hour together; and then it leaves me in a great &s;weat, as much fatigued as if I had been labouring at the plough. All this de&s;cription of my cough in pro&s;e, is only to introduce another de&s;cription of it in ver&s;e, perhaps not worth your peru&s;al; but it is very &s;hort, and be&s;ides has this remarkable in it, that it was the production of four o'clock in the morning, while I lay in my bed to&s;&s;ing and coughing, and all unable to &s;leep.&mdash;<Q><L>Ante omnes morbos importuni&s;&s;ima tu&s;&s;is,</L>

<P>YOU are the fir&s;t who ever made a Mu&s;e of a Cough; to me it &s;eems a much more ea&s;y ta&s;k to ver&s;ify in one's &s;leep, (that indeed you were of old famous for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;uppo&s;e at Eaton School.</NOTE>) than for want of it. Not the wakeful nightingale (when &s;he had a cough) ever &s;ung &s;o &s;weetly. I give you thanks for your warble, and wi&s;h you could &s;ing your&s;elf to re&s;t. The&s;e wicked remains of your illne&s;s will &s;ure give way to warm weather and gentle ex|erci&s;e; which I hope you will not omit as the &s;ea&s;on advances. Whatever low &s;pirits and indolence, the effect of them, may advi&s;e to the contrary, I pray you add five &s;teps to your walk daily for my &s;ake; by the help of which, in a month's time, I propo&s;e to &s;et you on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>I talked of the Dunciad as concluding you had &s;een it; if you have not, do you choo&s;e I &s;hould get and &s;end it to you? I have my&s;elf, upon your recommendation, been reading Jo&s;eph Andrews. The incidents are ill laid and without invention; but the characters have a great deal of nature, which always plea&s;es even in her lowe&s;t &s;hapes. Par&s;on Adams is perfectly well; &s;o is Mrs. Slip&s;lop, and the &s;tory of Wil&s;on; and throughout he &s;hews him&s;elf well read in Stage-Coaches, Coun|try Squires, Inns, and Inns of Court. His reflections upon high people and low people, and mi&s;&s;es and ma&s;ters, are very good. However the exaltedne&s;s of &s;ome minds (or rather as I
<PB N="139" REF="142">
&s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect their in&s;ipidity and want of feeling or ob&s;erva|tion) may make them in&s;en&s;ible to the&s;e light things, (I mean &s;uch as characterize and paint nature) yet &s;urely they are as weighty and much more u&s;eful than your grave di&s;cour&s;es upon the mind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He &s;eems here to glance at Hutchin&s;on, the di&s;ciple of Shaft&s;bury: Of whom he had little better opinion, than of his ma&s;ter.</NOTE>, the pa&s;&s;ions, and what not. Now as the paradi|&s;aical plea&s;ures <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Whim&s;ically put.&mdash;But what &s;hall we &s;ay of the pre&s;ent ta&s;te of the French, when a writer whom Mr. Gray &s;o ju&s;tly e&s;teemed as M. Marivaux is now held in &s;uch contempt, that <HI>Marivauder</HI> is a fa&s;hionable phra&s;e among&s;t them, and &s;ignifies neither more nor le&s;s, than our own fa&s;hionable phra&s;e of <HI>pro&s;ing?</HI> As to Crebillon, 'twas his <Q REND="inline">"Egaremens du Coeur &amp; d'E&s;prit"</Q> that our author chiefly e&s;teemed; he had not, I believe, at this time publi&s;hed his more licentious pieces.</NOTE> of the Mahometans con&s;i&s;t in playing upon the flute and lying with Houris, be mine to read eternal new romances of Marivaux and Crebillon.</P>
<P>You are very good in giving your&s;elf the trouble to read and find fault with my long harangues. Your freedom (as you call it) has &s;o little need of apologies, that I &s;hould &s;carce excu&s;e your treating me any otherwi&s;e; which, whatever compliment it might be to my vanity, would be making a very ill one to my under&s;tanding. As to matter of &s;tile, I have this to &s;ay: The language of the age <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nothing can be more ju&s;t than this ob&s;ervation; and nothing more likely to pre&s;erve our poetry from falling into in&s;ipidity, than pur&s;uing the rules here laid down for &s;upporting the diction of it: Particularly with re&s;pect to the Drama.</NOTE> is never the language of poetry; except among the French, who&s;e ver&s;e, where the thought or image does not &s;upport it, differs in nothing from pro&s;e. Our poetry,
<PB N="140" REF="143">
on the contrary, has a language peculiar to it&s;elf; to which al|mo&s;t every one, that has written, has added &s;omething by en|riching it with foreign idioms and derivatives: Nay &s;ometimes words of their own compo&s;ition or invention. Shake&s;pear and Milton have been great creators this way; and no one more li|centious than Pope or Dryden, who perpetually borrow ex|pre&s;&s;ions from the former. Let me give you &s;ome in&s;tances from Dryden, whom every body reckons a great ma&s;ter of our poetical tongue.&mdash;Full of <HI>mu&s;eful mopeings</HI>&mdash;unlike the <HI>trim</HI> of love&mdash;a plea&s;ant <HI>beverage</HI>&mdash;a <HI>roundelay</HI> of love&mdash;&s;tood &s;ilent in his <HI>mood</HI>&mdash;with knots and <HI>knares</HI> deformed&mdash;his <HI>ireful mood</HI>&mdash;in proud <HI>array</HI>&mdash;his <HI>boon</HI> was granted&mdash;and <HI>di&s;array</HI> and &s;hame|ful rout&mdash;<HI>wayward</HI> but wi&s;e&mdash;<HI>furbi&s;hed</HI> for the field&mdash;the <HI>foiled dodderd</HI> oaks&mdash;<HI>di&s;herited</HI>&mdash;<HI>&s;mouldring</HI> flames&mdash;<HI>retchle&s;s</HI> of laws&mdash;<HI>crones</HI> old and ugly&mdash;the <HI>beldam</HI> at his &s;ide&mdash;the <HI>grandam-hag</HI>&mdash;<HI>villanize</HI> his father's fame.&mdash;But they are infinite: And our language not being a &s;ettled thing (like the French) has an un|doubted right to words of an hundred years old, provided an|tiquity have not rendered them unintelligible. In truth, Shake|&s;pear's language is one of his principal beauties; and he has no le&s;s advantage over your Addi&s;ons and Rows in this, than in tho&s;e other great excellencies you mention. Every word in him is a picture. Pray put me the following lines into the tongue of our modern Dramatics:<Q><L>But I, that am not &s;haped for &s;portive tricks,</L>
<L>Nor made to court an amorous looking-gla&s;s:</L>
<L>I, that am rudely &s;tampt, and want love's maje&s;ty</L>

<HEAD>Mr. WEST to Mr. GRAY.</HEAD>
<P>TO begin with the conclu&s;ion of your letter, which is Greek, I de&s;ire that you will quarrel no more with your manner of pa&s;&s;ing your time. In my opinion it is irreproach|able, e&s;pecially as it produces &s;uch excellent fruit; and if I, like a &s;aucy bird, mu&s;t be pecking at it, you ought to con&s;ider that it is becau&s;e I like it. No una litura I beg you, no unravel|ling of your web, dear Sir! only pur&s;ue it a little further, and then one &s;hall be able to judge of it a little better. You know the cri&s;is of a play is in the fir&s;t act; its damnation or &s;alvation wholly re&s;ts there. But till that fir&s;t act is over, every body &s;u&s;pends his vote; &s;o how do you think I can form, as yet, any ju&s;t idea of the &s;peeches in regard to their length or &s;hortne&s;s? The connection and &s;ymmetry of &s;uch little parts with one another mu&s;t naturally e&s;cape me, as not having the plan of the whole in my head; neither can I decide about the thoughts whether they are wrong or &s;uperfluous; they may have &s;ome future tendency which I perceive not. The &s;tyle only was free to me, and there I find we are pretty much of the &s;ame &s;enti|ment: For you &s;ay the affectation of imitating Shake&s;pear may doubtle&s;s be carried too far; I &s;ay as much and no more. For old words we know are old gold, provided they are well cho&s;en. Whatever Ennius was, I do not con&s;ider Shake&s;pear as a dunghill in the lea&s;t: On the contrary, he is a mine of antient ore, where all our great modern poets have found their
<PB N="143" REF="146">
advantage. I do not know how it is; but his old expre&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shake&s;pear's energy does not ari&s;e &s;o much from the&s;e old expre&s;&s;ions, (mo&s;t of which were not old in his time) but from his artificial management of them. This artifice in the great Poet is developed with much exactne&s;s by Dr. Hurd in his excellent note on this pa&s;&s;age in Horace's Ep. ad Pi&s;ones.
<Q><L>Dixeris egregi&egrave;, notum &s;i callida verbum</L>
<L>Reddiderit junctura novum.</L></Q><BIBL><HI>See Hurd's Horace, vol.</HI> 1<HI>&s;t, Ed.</HI> 4<HI>th, p.</HI> 49.</BIBL></NOTE> have more energy in them than ours, and are even more adapted to poetry; certainly, where they are judiciou&s;ly and &s;paringly in|&s;erted, they add a certain grace to the compo&s;ition; in the &s;ame manner as Pou&s;&s;in gave a beauty to his pictures by his know|ledge in the antient proportions: But &s;hould he, or any other painter, carry the imitation too far, and neglect that be&s;t of models Nature, I am afraid it would prove a very flat perfor|mance. To fini&s;h this long critici&s;m: I have this further no|tion about old words revived, (is not this a pretty way of fini&s;hing?) I think them of excellent u&s;e in tales; they add a certain drollery to the comic, and a romantic gravity to the &s;e|rious, which are both charming in their kind; and this way of charming Dryden under&s;tood very well. One need only read Milton to acknowledge the dignity they give the Epic. But now comes my opinion that they ought to be u&s;ed in Tragedy more &s;paringly, than in mo&s;t kinds of poetry. Tragedy is de&s;igned for public repre&s;entation, and what is de&s;igned for that &s;hould be certainly mo&s;t intelligible.

<P>I Should not have failed to an&s;wer your Letter immediately, but I went out of town for a little while, which hindered me. Its length (be&s;ides the plea&s;ure naturally accompanying a long letter from you) affords me a new one, when I think it is a &s;ymptom of the recovery of your health, and flatter my&s;elf that your bodily &s;trength returns in proportion. Pray do not forget to mention the progre&s;s you make continually. As to Agrippina, I begin to be of your opinion; and find my&s;elf (as women are of their children) le&s;s enamoured of my productions the older they grow.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He never after awakened her; and I believe this was occa&s;ioned by the &s;tric|tures which his friend had made on his dramatic &s;tyle; which (though he did not think them well founded, as they certainly were not) had an effect which Mr. We&s;t, we may believe, did not intend them to have. I remember &s;ome years after I was al&s;o the innocent cau&s;e of his delaying to fini&s;h his fine ode on the progre&s;s of Poetry. I told him, on reading the part he &s;hewed me, that <Q REND="inline">"though I admired it greatly, and thought that it breathed the very &s;pirit of Pindar, yet I &s;u&s;pected it would by no means hit the public ta&s;te."</Q> Finding afterwards that he did not proceed in fini&s;hing it, I often expo&s;tulated with him on the &s;ubject; but he always replied <Q REND="inline">"No, you have thrown cold water upon it."</Q> I mention this little anecdote, to &s;hew how much the opinion of a friend, even when it did not convince his judgment, affected his inclination.</NOTE> She is laid up to &s;leep till next &s;um|mer; &s;o bid her good night.

tongue, which is too diffu&s;e, and daily grows more and more enervate. One &s;hall never be more &s;en&s;ible of this, than in turning an Author like Tacitus.

<P>MINE, you are to know, is a white Melancholy, or rather Leucocholy for the mo&s;t part; which though it &s;eldom laughs or dances, nor ever amounts to what one calls Joy or Plea&s;ure, yet is a good ea&s;y &s;ort of a &s;tate, and &ccedil;a ne lai&s;&s;e que de s'amu&s;er. The only fault of it is in&s;ipidity; which is apt now and then to give a &s;ort of Ennui, which makes one form certain little wi&s;hes that &s;ignify nothing. But there is another &s;ort, black indeed, which I have now and then felt, that has &s;omewhat in it like Tertullian's rule of faith, Credo quia im|po&s;&s;ibile e&s;t; for it believes, nay, is &s;ure of every thing that is unlikely, &s;o it be but frightful; and, on the other hand, ex|cludes and &s;huts its eyes to the mo&s;t po&s;&s;ible hopes, and every thing that is plea&s;urable; from this the Lord deliver us! for none but he and &s;un&s;hiny weather can do it.

Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a was the &s;on of Gala King of the Ma&s;|&s;yli; and, when very young at the head of his father's army, gave a mo&s;t &s;ignal overthrow to Syphax, King of the Ma&s;ae|&s;ylians, then an ally of the Romans. Soon after A&s;drubal, &s;on of Gi&s;go the Carthaginian General, gave the beautiful Sopho|ni&s;ba,
<PB N="153" REF="156">
his daughter, in marriage to the young prince. But this marriage was not con&s;ummated on account of Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a's be|ing obliged to ha&s;ten into Spain, there to command his father's troops, who were auxiliaries of the Carthaginians. Their af|fairs at this time began to be in a bad condition; and they thought it might be greatly for their intere&s;t, if they could bring over Syphax to them&s;elves. This in time they actually effected; and, to &s;trengthen their new alliance, commanded A&s;drubal to give his daughter to Syphax. (It is probable their ingratitude to Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a aro&s;e from the great change of affairs, which had happened among the Ma&s;&s;ylians during his ab&s;ence; for his father and uncle were dead, and a di&s;tant relation of the royal family had u&s;urped the throne.) Sophoni&s;ba was accord|ingly married to Syphax; and Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a, enraged at the af|front, became a friend to the Romans. They drove the Car|thaginians before them out of Spain, and carried the war into Africa, defeated Syphax, and took him pri&s;oner; upon which Cirtha (his capital) opened her gates to Laelius and Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a. The re&s;t of the affair, the marriage, and the &s;ending of poi|&s;on, every body knows. This is partly taken from Livy, and partly from Appian.</P>

<P>Immediately after writing the preceding Letter, Mr. Gray went upon a vi&s;it to his relations at Stoke; where he writ that beautiful little Ode which &s;tands fir&s;t in his collection of Poems.

He &s;ent it as &s;oon as written to his beloved friend; but he was dead<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This &s;ingular anecdote is founded on a marginal note in his common-place book, where that Ode is tran&s;cribed, and the following memorandum annexed: <Q REND="inline">"Written at Stoke the beginning of June 1742, and &s;ent to Mr. We&s;t, not knowing he was then dead."</Q></NOTE> before it reached Hertford&s;hire. He died<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was buried at Hatfield (the Hou&s;e called Popes being in that pari&s;h.)

the Augu&s;t following: for as both the&s;e Poems abound with Pathos, tho&s;e who have feeling hearts will feel this excellence the more &s;trongly, when they know the cau&s;e from whence it aro&s;e; and the unfeeling will, perhaps, learn to re&s;pect what they cannot ta&s;te, when they are prevented from imputing to a &s;plenetic melancholy, what in fact &s;prung from the mo&s;t benevolent of all &s;en&s;ations. I am inclined to believe that the Elegy in a Country Church-yard was begun, if not concluded, at this time al&s;o: Though I am aware that, as it &s;tands at pre|&s;ent, the conclu&s;ion is of a later date; how that was originally, I &s;hall &s;hew in my notes on the poem. But the fir&s;t impul&s;e of his &s;orrow for the death of his friend gave birth to a very tender Sonnet in Engli&s;h, on the Petrarchian model; and al&s;o to a &s;ublime Apo&s;trophe in Hexameters, written in the Genuine &s;train of Cla&s;&s;ical maje&s;ty, with which he intended to begin one of his books, <Q REND="inline">"De Principiis Cogitandi."</Q> This I &s;hall &s;hortly give the Reader: But the &s;onnet, being completed, I re&s;erve for publication among&s;t the re&s;t of his Poems.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem &s;omewhat extraordinary, that Mr. Gray never attempted any thing in Engli&s;h ver&s;e, (except the beginning of Agrippina, and a few tran&s;lations) before the fir&s;t Ode lately mentioned. Shall we attribute this to his having been educated at Eton, or to what other cau&s;e? Certain it is, that when I fir&s;t knew him, he &s;eemed to &s;et a greater value on his Latin poetry, than on that which he had compo&s;ed in his native language; and had almo&s;t the &s;ame foible then, which I have &s;ince known him laugh at in Petrarch, when we read that mo&s;t entertaining of all books, entitled <Q REND="inline">"Memories pour la vie de Fran&ccedil;ois Pe|trarque tir&eacute;s de &s;es oeuvres,"</Q> &amp;c. I am apt to think that the
<PB N="158" REF="161">
little popularity which M. de Polignac's Anti-Lucretius ac|quired, after it had been &s;o long and &s;o eagerly expected by the learned, induced Mr. Gray to lay a&s;ide his didactic Plan. How|ever this may be, he writ no Latin ver&s;e after this period; ex|cept perhaps &s;ome part of the 1 &s;t book of the Poem ju&s;t men|tioned. This therefore &s;eems the proper place to introduce that fragment; which being the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in it&s;elf of all his Latin Compo&s;itions, and perhaps the mo&s;t laboured of any of his Poems, it were to be wi&s;hed that I could give the reader more in&s;ight into his de&s;ign, than the few &s;cattered pa|pers, which he has left, enable me to do. It is clear, how|ever, from the Exordium it&s;elf, that he meant to make the &s;ame u&s;e of Mr. Locke's E&s;&s;ay on the human Under&s;tanding, which Lucretius did of the Dogmas of Epicurus. And the fir&s;t &s;ix lines plainly intimate, that his general de&s;ign was to be com|prized in four books.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION THE FOURTH.</HEAD>
<P>THE three foregoing Sections have carried the Reader through the juvenile part of Mr. Gray's life, and nearly, alas, to half of its duration. Tho&s;e which remain, though le&s;s diver&s;ified by incidents, will, notwith&s;tanding, I flatter my&s;elf, be equally in&s;tructive and amu&s;ing, as &s;everal of his mo&s;t inti|mate friends have very kindly furni&s;hed me with their collec|tions of his letters; which, added to tho&s;e I have my&s;elf pre&s;er|ved, will enable me to &s;elect from them many excellent &s;peci|mens of his more mature judgment, correct ta&s;te, and exten&s;ive learning, blended at the &s;ame time with many amiable in&s;tances of his &s;en&s;ibility: they will al&s;o &s;pecify the few remaining anecdotes, which occurred in a life &s;o retired and &s;edentary as his: for the Reader mu&s;t be here informed that, from the winter of the year 1742 to the day of his death, his principal re&s;idence was at Cambridge. He indeed, during the lives of his mother and aunts, &s;pent his &s;ummer vacations at Stoke; and, after they died, in making little tours on vi&s;its to his friends in different parts of the country: But he was &s;eldom ab|&s;ent from college any con&s;iderable time, except between the years 1759 and 1762; when, on the opening of the Briti&s;h Mu&s;aeum, he took lodgings in Southampton Row, in order to
<PB N="171" REF="174">
have recour&s;e to the Harleian and other Manu&s;cripts there de|po&s;ited, from which he made &s;everal curious extracts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e, amounting in all to a tolerably-&s;ized folio, are at pre&s;ent in Mr. Wal|pole's hands. He has already printed the &s;peech of Sir Thomas Wyat from them in the &s;econd number of his Mi&s;cellaneous Antiquities. The Public mu&s;t impute it to their own want of curio&s;ity if more of them do not appear in print.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It may &s;eem &s;trange that a per&s;on who had conceived &s;o early a di&s;like to Cambridge, and who (as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently) now returned to it with this prejudice rather augmented, &s;hould, when he was free to choo&s;e, make that very place his principal abode for near thirty years: But this I think may be ea&s;ily accounted for from his love of books, (ever his ruling pa&s;&s;ion) and the &s;traitne&s;s of his circum&s;tances which prevented the gratification of it. For to a man, who could not conveniently purcha&s;e even a &s;mall library, what &s;ituation &s;o eligible as that which affords free acce&s;s to a number of large ones? This rea&s;on al&s;o accounts for another &s;ingular fact. We have &s;een that, during his re&s;idence at Stoke, in the &s;pring and &s;ummer of this &s;ame year 1742, he writ a con&s;iderable part of his more fini&s;hed poems. Hence one would be naturally led to conclude that, on his return to Cambridge, when the ceremony of taking his degree was over, the quiet of the place would have prompted him to continue the cultivation of his poetical ta|lents, and that immediately, as the Mu&s;e &s;eems in this year to have peculiarly in&s;pired him; but this was not the ca&s;e. Reading, he has often told me, was much more agreeable to him than writing: He therefore now laid a&s;ide compo&s;ition almo&s;t entirely, and applied him&s;elf with inten&s;e a&s;&s;iduity to the &s;tudy of the be&s;t Greek authors; in&s;omuch that, in the
<PB N="172" REF="175">
&s;pace of about &s;ix years, there were hardly any writers of note in that language which he had not only read but dige&s;ted; remark|ing, by the mode of common-place, their contents, their dif|ficult and corrupt pa&s;&s;ages, and all this with the accuracy of a critic added to the diligence of a &s;tudent.</P>
<P>Before I in&s;ert the next &s;eries of letters, I mu&s;t take the li|berty to mention, that it was not till about the year 1747 that I had the happine&s;s of being introduced to the acquaintance of Mr. Gray. Some very juvenile imitations of Milton's juvenile poems, which I had written a year or two before, and of which the Monody on Mr. Pope's death was the principal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The other two were in imitation of <Q REND="inline">"l'Allegro &amp; il Pen&s;ero&s;o,"</Q> and intitled <Q REND="inline">"Il Bellico&s;o &amp; il Pacifico."</Q> The latter of the&s;e I was per&s;uaded to revi&s;e and publi&s;h in the Cambridge Collection of Ver&s;es on the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, 1748. The former has &s;ince got into a Mi&s;cellany, printed by G. Pearch, from the indi&s;cretion, I &s;uppo&s;e, of &s;ome acquaintance who had a copy of it.</NOTE>, he then, at the reque&s;t of one of my friends, was &s;o obliging as to revi&s;e. The &s;ame year, on account of a di&s;pute which had happened between the ma&s;ter and fellows of Pembroke Hall, I had the honour of being nominated by the Fellows to fill one of the vacant Fellow&s;hips<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tho' nominated in 1747, I was not elected Fellow till February, 1749. The Ma&s;ter having refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent, claiming a negative, the affair was there|fore not compromi&s;ed till after an ineffectual litigation of two years.</NOTE>. I was at this time &s;cholar of St. John's College, and Batchelor of Arts, per&s;onally un|known to the gentlemen who favoured me &s;o highly; therefore that they gave me this mark of di&s;tinction and preference was greatly owing to Mr. Gray, who was well acquainted with &s;everal of that &s;ociety, and to Dr. Heberden, who&s;e known
<PB N="173" REF="176">
partiality to every, even the &s;malle&s;t degree of merit, led him warmly to &s;econd his recommendation. The Reader, I hope, will excu&s;e this &s;hort piece of egoti&s;m, as it is written to expre&s;s my gratitude, as well to the living as the dead, to declare the &s;en&s;e I &s;hall ever retain of the honour which the Fellows of Pembroke Hall then did me, and to particularize the time of an incident which brought me into the neighbour|hood of Mr. Gray's College; and &s;erved to give that cement to our future intimacy, which is u&s;ually rendered &s;tronger by proximity of place.</P>
<P>The Letters, which I &s;elect for this Section, are from the date of the year 1742 to that of 1768, when Mr. Gray was made Profe&s;&s;or of Modern Hi&s;tory. This, as it is a con&s;ider|able interval of time, will perhaps require me the more fre|quently to re&s;ume my narrative; e&s;pecially as I cannot now produce one continued chain of corre&s;pondence.</P>

As for you, if your di&s;temper and you can but agree about go|ing to London, I may rea&s;onably expect in a much &s;horter time to &s;ee you in your three-cornered villa, doing the honours of a well-furni&s;hed table with as much dignity, as rich a mien, and as capacious a belly, as Dr. Mead.

<P>Though I have &s;aid that Mr. Gray, on his return to Cam|bridge, laid a&s;ide Poetry almo&s;t entirely, yet I find among&s;t his papers a &s;mall fragment in ver&s;e, which bears internal evidence that it was written about this very time. The foregoing Letter, in which he employs &s;o much of his u&s;ual vein of ridicule on the Univer&s;ity, &s;eems to be no improper introduction to it: I &s;hall therefore in&s;ert it here without making any apology, as I have given one, on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, in the fir&s;t &s;ection.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to have been intended as a Hymn or Addre&s;s to Ig|norance; and I pre&s;ume, had he proceeded with it, would have contained much good Satire upon fal&s;e Science and &s;chola&s;tic Pedantry. What he writ of it is purely introductory; yet many of the lines are &s;o &s;trong, and the general ca&s;t of the ver&s;ifica|tion &s;o mu&s;ical, that I believe it will give the generality of Readers a higher opinion of his poetical Talents, than many of his Lyrical Productions have done. I &s;peak of the Generality; becau&s;e it is a certain fact, that their ta&s;te is founded upon the ten-&s;yllable couplets of Dryden and Pope, and upon the&s;e only.</P>

<P>YOU write &s;o feelingly to Mr. Brown, and repre&s;ent your abandoned condition in terms &s;o touching, that what gra|titude could not effect in &s;everal months, compa&s;&s;ion has brought about in a few days; and broke that &s;trong attach|ment, or rather allegiance, which I and all here owe to our &s;overeign Lady and Mi&s;tre&s;s, the Pre&s;ident of Pre&s;idents and Head of Heads, (if I may be permitted to pronounce her name, that ineffable Octogrammaton) the power of Lazine&s;s. You mu&s;t know &s;he had been plea&s;ed to appoint me (in preference to &s;o many old &s;ervants of her's who had &s;pent their whole lives in qualifying them&s;elves for the office) Grand Picker of Straws and Pu&s;h-pin Player to her Supinity (for that is her title). The fir&s;t is much in the nature of Lord Pre&s;ident of the Council; and the other, like the Groom-Porter, only with|out

the profit; but as they are both things of very great ho|nour in this country, I con&s;idered with my&s;elf the load of Envy attending &s;uch great charges; and be&s;ides (between you and me) I found my&s;elf unable to &s;upport the fatigue of keep|ing up the appearance that per&s;ons of &s;uch dignity mu&s;t do, &s;o I thought proper to decline it, and excu&s;ed my&s;elf as well as I could. However, as you &s;ee &s;uch an affair mu&s;t take up a good deal of time, and it has always been the Policy of this court to proceed &s;lowly, like the Imperial and that of Spain, in the di&s;patch of Bu&s;ine&s;s, you will on this account the ea&s;ier forgive me, if I have not an&s;wered your Letter be|fore.</P>
<P>You de&s;ire to know, it &s;eems, what Character the Poem of your young friend bears here<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Plea&s;ures of the Imagination: from the po&s;thumous publication of Dr. Akin|&s;ide's Poems, it &s;hould &s;eem that the Author had very much the &s;ame Opinion afterwards of his own Work, which Mr. Gray here expre&s;&s;es: &s;ince he undertook a reform of it which mu&s;t have given him, had he concluded it, as much trouble as if he had written it entirely new.</NOTE>. I wonder that you a&s;k the opinion of a Nation, where tho&s;e, who pretend to judge, do not judge at all; and the re&s;t (the wi&s;er part) wait to catch the judgment of the world immediately above them; that is, Dick's and the Rainbow Coffee-hou&s;es. Your readier way would be to a&s;k the Ladies that keep the Bars in tho&s;e two theatres of Critici&s;m. However, to &s;hew you that I am a judge, as well as my Countrymen, I will tell you, though I have rather turned it over than read it, (but no matter; no more have they) that it &s;eems to me above the middling; and now and then, for a little while, ri&s;es even to the be&s;t, par|ticularly in de&s;cription. It is often ob&s;cure, and even unin|telligible;

and too much infected with the Hutchin&s;on jargon. In &s;hort, its great fault is, that it was publi&s;hed at lea&s;t nine years too early. And &s;o methinks in a few words, <Q REND="inline">"&agrave; l&agrave; mode du Temple,"</Q> I have very pertly di&s;patched what perhaps may for &s;everal years have employed a very ingenious man worth fifty of my&s;elf.</P>

like chop'd hay, or rather like chop'd logic; for he has a violent affection to that art, being in &s;ome &s;ort his own invention; &s;o that he often lo&s;es him&s;elf in little trifling di&s;tinctions and verbal niceties; and, what is wor&s;e, leaves you to extricate him as well as you can.

<P>Literature, to take it in its mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e, and include every thing that requires invention or judgment, or barely application and indu&s;try, &s;eems indeed drawing apace to its di&s;&s;olution, and remarkably &s;ince the beginning of the war. I remember to have read Mr. Spence's pretty book; though (as he then had not been at Rome for the la&s;t time) it mu&s;t have increa&s;ed greatly &s;ince that in bulk. If you a&s;k me what I read, I prote&s;t I do not recollect one &s;yllable; but only in general, that they were the be&s;t bred &s;ort of men in the world, ju&s;t the kind of <HI>frinds</HI> one would wi&s;h to meet in a fine &s;um|mer's evening, if one wi&s;hed to meet any at all.

As it has now been laid a&s;ide &s;ome years, we may hope, for the &s;ake of true ta&s;te, that this frippery mode of compo&s;ition will never come into fa&s;hion again; e&s;pecially &s;ince Dr. Hurd has pointed out, by example as well as precept, wherein the true beauty of Dialogue-writing con&s;i&s;ts.</NOTE>.

<P>I Have abundance of thanks to return you for the entertain|ment Mr. Spence's book has given me, which I have al|mo&s;t run over already; and I much fear (&s;ee what it is to make a figure) the breadth of the margin, and the neatne&s;s of the prints, which are better done than one could expect, have pre|vailed upon me to like it far better than I did in manu&s;cript; for I think it is not the very genteel deportment of Polymetis, nor the lively wit of My&s;agetes, that have at all corrupted me.</P>
<P>There is one fundamental fault, from whence mo&s;t of the little faults throughout the whole ari&s;e. He profe&s;&s;es to ne|glect the Greek writers, who could have given him more in|&s;truction on the very heads he profe&s;&s;es to treat, than all the others put together; who does not know, that upon the Latin, the Sabine, and Hetru&s;can mythology (which probably might them&s;elves, at a remoter period of time, owe their origin to Greece too) the Romans ingrafted almo&s;t the whole religion of Greece to make what is called their own? It would be hard
<PB N="186" REF="189">
to find any one circum&s;tance that is properly of their invention. In the ruder days of the republic, the picture&s;que part of their religion (which is the province he has cho&s;e, and would be thought to confine him&s;elf to) was probably borrowed entirely from the Tu&s;cans, who, as a wealthy and trading people, may be well &s;uppo&s;ed, and indeed are known, to have had the arts flouri&s;hing in a con&s;iderable degree among them. What could inform him here, but Dio. Halicarna&s;&s;us (who expre&s;sly treats of tho&s;e times with great curio&s;ity and indu&s;try) and the remains of the fir&s;t Roman writers? The former he has neglected as a Greek; and the latter, he &s;ays, were but little acquainted with the arts, and con&s;equently are but of &s;mall authority. In the better ages, when every temple and public building in Rome was peopled with imported deities and heroes, and when all the arti&s;ts of reputation they made u&s;e of were Greeks, what wonder, if their eyes grew familiari&s;ed to Grecian forms and habits (e&s;pecially in a matter of this kind, where &s;o much de|pends upon the imagination); and if tho&s;e figures introduced with them a belief of &s;uch fables, as fir&s;t gave them being, and dre&s;&s;ed them out in their various attributes, it was natu|ral then, and (I &s;hould think) nece&s;&s;ary, to go to the &s;ource it&s;elf, the Greek accounts of their own religion; but, to &s;ay the truth, I &s;u&s;pect he was little conver&s;ant in tho&s;e books and that language; for he rarely quotes any but Lucian, an author that falls in every body's way, and who lived at the very ex|tremity of that period he has &s;et to his enquiries, later than any of the poets he has meddled with, and for that rea&s;on ought to have been regarded as but an indifferent authority; e&s;pecially being a Syrian too. His book (as he &s;ays him&s;elf) is, I think, rather a beginning than a perfect work; but a beginning at the
<PB N="187" REF="190">
wrong end: For if any body &s;hould fini&s;h it by enquiring into the Greek mythology, as he propo&s;es, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to read it backward.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal little neglects, that one might have told him of, which I noted in reading it ha&s;tily; as page 311, a di&s;|cour&s;e about orange-trees, occa&s;ioned by Virgil's <Q REND="inline">"inter ode|ratum lauri nemus,"</Q> where he fancies the Roman Laurus to be our Laurel; tho' undoubtedly the bay-tree, which is <HI>odora|tum,</HI> and (I believe) &s;till called Lauro, or Alloro, at Rome; and that the <Q REND="inline">"Malum Medicum"</Q> in the Georgick is the orange; tho' Theophra&s;tus, whence Virgil borrowed it, or even Pliny whom he him&s;elf quotes, might convince him it is the cedrato which he has often ta&s;ted at Florence. Page 144 is an account of Domenichino's Cardinal Virtues, and a fling at the Je&s;uits, neither of which belong to them: The painting is in a church of the Barnabiti, dedicated to St. Carlo Borromeo, who&s;e motto is HUMILITAS. Page 151, in a note, he &s;ays, the old Romans did not regard Fortune as a Deity; tho' Servius Tullius (whom &s;he was &s;aid to be in love with; nay, there was ac|tually an affair between them) founded her temple in Foro Boario. By the way, her wor&s;hip was Greek, and this king was educated in the family of Tarquinius Pri&s;cus, who&s;e father was a Corinthian; &s;o it is ea&s;y to conceive how early the reli|gion of Rome might be mixed with that of Greece, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Dr. Middleton has &s;ent me to-day a book on the Roman Senate, the &s;ub&s;tance of a di&s;pute between Lord Hervey and him, tho' it never interrupted <HI>their</HI> friend&s;hip, he &s;ays, and I dare &s;ay not.</P>

Aegyptian hi&s;tory, and particularly the account of the gold mines? My own readings have been cruelly interrupted: What I have been highly plea&s;ed with, is the new Comedy from Paris by Gre&s;&s;et, called le Mechant; if you have it not, buy his works altogether in two little volumes, they are collected by the Dutch book&s;ellers, and con&s;equently contain &s;ome tra&s;h; but then there are the Ver-vert, the Epi&s;tle to P. Bougeant, the Chartreu&s;e, that to his &s;i&s;ter, an Ode on his country, and another on Mediocrity, and the Sidnei, another Comedy, all which have great beauties: There is al&s;o a Poem lately publi&s;hed by Thomp&s;on, called the Ca&s;tle of Indolence, with &s;ome good &s;tanzas in it. Mr. Ma&s;on is my acquaintance; I liked that Ode<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ode to a Water Nymph, publi&s;hed about this time in Dod&s;ley's Mi&s;cellany.

<P>I Am glad you have had any plea&s;ure in Gre&s;&s;et; he &s;eems to me a truly elegant and charming writer; the Mechant is the be&s;t Comedy I ever read; his Edward I could &s;carce get through; it is puerile; though there are good lines, &s;uch as this for example:
<Q><L>" Le jour d'un nouveau regne e&s;t le jour des ingrats."</L></Q>
But good lines will make any thing rather than a good play: However you are to con&s;ider this is a collection made up by the Dutch book&s;ellers; many things unfini&s;hed, or written in his youth, or de&s;igned not for the world, but to make his friends laugh, as the Lutrin vivant, &amp;c.

The fir&s;t fifty-&s;even ver&s;es of an Ethical E&s;&s;ay accompanied this letter, which I &s;hall here in&s;ert, with about fifty lines more, all of them fini&s;hed in his highe&s;t manner. Had this noble de|&s;ign been compleated, I may, with great boldne&s;s, a&s;&s;ert that it would have been one of the mo&s;t capital Poems of the kind that ever appeared either in our own, or any language. I am not able to inform the reader how many E&s;&s;ays he meant to write upon the &s;ubject; nor do I believe that he had ever &s;o far &s;ettled his plan as to determine that point: But &s;ince his theme was as exten&s;ive as human nature, (an ob&s;ervation he him&s;elf makes in a &s;ub&s;equent letter on the <Q REND="inline">"E&s;prit des Loix"</Q>) it is plain the whole work would have been con&s;iderable in point of &s;ize. He was bu&s;ily employed in it at the time when M. de Monte&s;quieu's book was fir&s;t publi&s;hed: On reading it, he &s;aid the Baron had fore&s;talled &s;ome of his be&s;t thoughts; and yet the reader will find, from the &s;mall fragment he has left, that the two writers differ a little in one very material point, viz. the influence of &s;oil and climate on national manners.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <BIBL>L'E&s;prit des Loix, Liv. 14. chap. 2, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE> Some time after he had thoughts of re&s;uming his plan, and of dedicating it, by an introductory Ode, to M. de Monte&s;quieu; but that great man's death, which happened in 1755, made him drop his de&s;ign finally.</P>
<P>On carefully reviewing the &s;cattered papers in pro&s;e, which he writ, as hints for his own u&s;e in the pro&s;ecution of this work, I think it be&s;t to form part of them into a kind of com|mentary at the bottom of the pages; they will &s;erve greatly to elucidate (as far as they go) the method of his rea&s;oning.</P>
<Q><PB N="193" REF="196"><LG>
<HEAD>ESSAY I. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>COMMENTARY.</P>
<P>The Author's &s;ubject being (as we have &s;een) THE NECESSARY ALLIANCE BETWEEN A GOOD FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND A GOOD MODE OF EDU|CATION, IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THE HAPPINESS OF MANKIND, the Poem opens with two &s;imiles; an uncommon kind of exordium: but which I &s;uppo&s;e the Poet intentionally cho&s;e, to intimate the analogical method he meant to pur&s;ue in his &s;ub&s;equent rea&s;onings. 1&s;t, He a&s;&s;erts th&agrave;t men without education are like &s;ickly plants in a cold or barren &s;oil, (line 1 to 5, and 8 to 12;) and, 2dly, he compares them, when unble&s;t with a ju&s;t and well regulated government, to plants that will not blo&s;&s;om or bear fruit in an unkindly and inclement air (l. 5 to 9, and l. 13 to 22). Having thus laid down the two propo&s;itions he means to prove, he begins by examining into the characteri&s;tics which (taking a general view of mankind) all men have in common one with another (l. 22 to 39); they covet plea&s;ure and avoid pain (l. 31); they feel gratitude for benefits (l. 34); they de&s;ire to avenge wrongs, which they effect either by force or cunning (l. 35); they are linked to each other by their common feelings, and participate in &s;orrow and in joy (l. 36, 37). If then all the human &s;pecies agree in &s;o many moral particulars, whence ari&s;es the diver&s;ity of national characters? This que&s;tion the Poet puts at line 38, and dilates upon to l. 64. Why, &s;ays he, have &s;ome na|tions &s;hewn a propen&s;ity to commerce and indu&s;try; others to war and rapine; others to ea&s;e and plea&s;ure? (l. 42 to 46) Why have the Northern people over|&s;pread, in all ages, and prevailed over the Southern? (l. 46 to 58) Why has A&s;ia been, time out of mind, the &s;eat of de&s;poti&s;m, and Europe that of freedom? (l. 59 to 64.) Are we from the&s;e in&s;tances to imagine men nece&s;&s;arily en&s;laved to the inconveniences of the climate where they were born? (l. 64 to 72) Or are we not rather to &s;uppo&s;e there is a natural &s;trength in the human mind, that is able to vanqui&s;h and break through them? (l. 72 to 84) It is confe&s;t, how|ever, that men receive an early tincture from the &s;ituation they are placed in, and the climate which produces them (l. 84 to 88). Thus the inhabitants of the mountains, inured to labour and patience, are naturally trained to war (l. 88 to 96); while tho&s;e of the plain are more open to any attack, and &s;oftened by ea&s;e and plenty (l. 96 to 99). Again, the Aegyptians, from the nature of their &s;ituation, might be the inventors of home-navigation, from a nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up an intercour&s;e between their towns during the inundation of the Nile (l. 99 to ****). Tho&s;e per&s;ons would naturally have the fir&s;t turn to commerce, who inhabited a barren coa&s;t like the Tyrians, and were per&s;ecuted by &s;ome neighbouring tyrant; or were drove to take refuge on &s;ome &s;hoals, like the Venetian and Hollander; their di&s;covery of &s;ome rich i&s;land, in the infancy of the world, de&s;cribed. The Tartar hardened to war by his rigorous climate and pa&s;toral life, and by his di&s;putes for water and herbage in a country without land-marks, as al&s;o by &s;kirmi&s;hes between his rival clans, was con&s;equently fitted to conquer his rich Southern neighbours, whom ea&s;e and luxury had enervated: Yet this is no proof that liberty and valour may not exi&s;t in Southern climes, &s;ince the Syrians and Carthaginians gave noble in&s;tances of both; and the Ara|bians carried their conque&s;ts as far as the Tartars. Rome al&s;o (for many cen|turies) repul&s;ed tho&s;e very nations, which, when &s;he grew weak, at length demoli&s;hed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Reader will perceive that the Commentary goes further than the Text. The rea&s;on for which is, that the Editor found it &s;o on the paper from which he formed that comment; and as the thoughts &s;eemed to be tho&s;e which Mr. Gray would have next graced with the harmony of his numbers, he held it be&s;t to give them in continuation. There are other maxims on different papers, all apparently relating to the &s;ame &s;ubject, which are too excellent to be lo&s;t; the&s;e therefore (as the place in which he meant to employ them cannot be a&s;certained) I &s;hall &s;ubjoin to this note, under the title of detached Sentiments.</P>
<Q><P>"Man is a creature not capable of cultivating his mind but in &s;ociety, and in that only where he is not a &s;lave to the nece&s;&s;ities of life.</P>
<P>Want is the mother of the inferior arts, but ea&s;e that of the finer; as elo|quence, policy, morality, poetry, &s;culpture, painting, architecture, which are the improvements of the former.</P>
<P>The climate inclines &s;ome nations to contemplation and plea&s;ure; others to hard&s;hip, action, and war; but not &s;o as to incapacitate the former for courage and di&s;cipline, or the latter for civility, politene&s;s, and works of genius.</P>
<P>It is the proper work of education and government united to redre&s;s the faults that ari&s;e from the &s;oil and air.</P>
<P>The principal drift of education &s;hould be to make men <HI>think</HI> in the Northern climates, and <HI>act</HI> in the Southern.</P>
<P>The different &s;teps and degrees of education may be compared to the artificer's operations upon marble; it is one thing to dig it out of the quarry, and another to &s;quare it; to give it glo&s;s and lu&s;tre, call forth every beautiful &s;pot and vein, &s;hape it into a column, or animate it into a &s;tatue.</P>
<P>To a native of free and happy governments his country is alway dear:
<Q><L>" He loves his old hereditary trees."</L>
<BIBL>COWLEY.</BIBL></Q>
While the &s;ubject of a tyrant has no country; he is therefore &s;elfi&s;h and ba&s;e|minded; he has no family, no po&s;terity, no de&s;ire of fame; or, if he has, of one that turns not on its proper object.</P>
<P>Any nation that wants public &s;pirit, neglects education, ridicules the de&s;ire of fame, and even of virtue and rea&s;on, mu&s;t be ill governed.</P>
<P>Commerce changes intirely the fate and genius of nations, by communicating arts and opinions, circulating money, and introducing the materials of luxury; &s;he fir&s;t opens and poli&s;hes the mind, then corrupts and enervates both that and the body.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e inva&s;ions of effeminate Southern nations by the warlike Northern people, &s;eem (in &s;pite of all the terror, mi&s;chief, and ignorance which they brought with them) to be nece&s;&s;ary evils; in order to revive the &s;pirit of mankind, &s;oftened and broken by the arts of commerce, to re&s;tore them to their native liberty and equality, and to give them again the power of &s;upporting danger and hard&s;hip; &s;o a comet, with all the horrors that attend it as it pa&s;&s;es through our &s;y&s;tem, brings a &s;upply of warmth and light to the &s;un, and of moi&s;ture to the air.</P>
<P>The doctrine of Epicurus is ever ruinous to &s;ociety: It had its ri&s;e when Greece was declining, and perhaps ha&s;tened its di&s;&s;olution, as al&s;o that of Rome; it is now propagated in France and in England, and &s;eems likely to produce the &s;ame effect in both.</P>
<P>One principal characteri&s;tic of vice in the pre&s;ent age is the contempt of fame.</P>
<P>Many are the u&s;es of good fame to a generous mind: it extends our exi&s;tence and example into future ages; continues and propagates virtue, which otherwi&s;e would be as &s;hort-lived as our frame; and prevents the prevalence of vice in a generation more corrupt even than our own. It is impo&s;&s;ible to conquer that na|tural de&s;ire we have of being remembered; even criminal ambition and avarice, the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h of all pa&s;&s;ions, would wi&s;h to leave a name behind them."</P></Q>
<P>I find al&s;o among the&s;e papers a &s;ingle couplet much too beautiful to be lo&s;t, though the place where he meant to introduce it cannot be a&s;certained; it mu&s;t, however, have made a part of &s;ome de&s;cription of the effect which the reforma|tion had on our national manners:
<Q><L>When Love could teach a monarch to be wi&s;e,</L>
<L>And Go&s;pel-light fir&s;t dawn'd from BULLEN's Eyes.</L></Q>
Thus, with all the attention that a connoi&s;&s;eur in painting employs in collecting every &s;light outline as well as fini&s;hed drawing which led to the completion of &s;ome capital picture, I have endeavoured to pre&s;erve every fragment of this great poetical de&s;ign. It &s;urely de&s;erved this care, as it was one of the noble&s;t which Mr. Gray ever attempted; and al&s;o, as far as he carried it into execution, the mo&s;t exqui&s;itely fini&s;hed. That he carried it no further is, and mu&s;t ever be, a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible lo&s;s to the republic of letters.</P></NOTE> her exten&s;ive Empire. ****</P></NOTE></HEAD>

<P>YOU a&s;k for &s;ome account of books. The principal I can tell you of is a work of the Pre&s;ident Monte&s;quieu, the labour of twenty years; it is called L'E&s;prit des Loix, 2 vol. 4to, printed at Geneva. He lays down the principles on which are founded the three &s;orts of government, De&s;poti&s;m, the limited Monarchy, and the Republican; and &s;hews how
<PB N="202" REF="205">
from the&s;e are deduced the laws and cu&s;toms by which they are guided and maintained; the education proper to each form; the influence of climate, &s;ituation, religion, &amp;c. on the minds of particular nations and on their policy. The &s;ubject, you &s;ee, is as exten&s;ive as mankind; the thoughts perfectly new, generally admirable as they are ju&s;t, &s;ometimes a little too re|fined. In &s;hort, there are faults, but &s;uch as an ordinary man could never have committed. The &s;tyle very lively and conci&s;e (con&s;equently &s;ometimes ob&s;cure); it is the gravity of Tacitus,

<P>Mr. Birch, the indefatigable, has ju&s;t put out a thick octavo of original papers of Queen Elizabeth's time; there are many curious things in it, particularly letters from Sir Robert Cecil (Sali&s;bury) about his negotiations with Henry IV. of France, the Earl of Monmouth's odd account of Queen Elizabeth's death, &s;everal peculiarities of James I. and Prince Henry, &amp;c. and above all, an excellent account of the &s;tate of France, with characters of the king, his court, and mini&s;try, by Sir George Carew, amba&s;&s;ador there.

About this time Mr. Gray had put his la&s;t hand to his cele|brated Elegy in the Country Church-yard, and had communi|cated it to his friend Mr. Walpole, who&s;e good ta&s;te was too much charmed with it to &s;uffer him to withhold the &s;ight of it from his acquaintance; accordingly it was &s;hewn about for &s;ome time in manu&s;cript, (as Mr. Gray intimates in the &s;ub&s;e|quent letter to Dr. Wharton) and received with all the applau&s;e it &s;o ju&s;tly merited. Among&s;t the re&s;t of the fa&s;hionable world, for to the&s;e only it was at pre&s;ent communicated, Lady Cobham, who now lived at the man&s;ion-hou&s;e at Stoke-Pogis, had read and admired it. She wi&s;hed to be acquainted with the author; accordingly her relation Mi&s;s Speed and Lady Schaub, then at her hou&s;e, undertook to bring this about by making him the fir&s;t vi&s;it. He happened to be from home, when the Ladies arrived at his Aunt's &s;olitary man&s;ion; and, when he returned, was &s;urprized to find, written on one of his papers in the parlour where he u&s;ually read, the following note: <Q REND="inline">"Lady Schaub's compliments to Mr. Gray; &s;he is &s;orry not to have found him at home, to tell him that Lady Brown is very well."</Q> This nece&s;&s;arily obliged him to return the vi&s;it, and &s;oon after induced him to compo&s;e a ludicrous ac|count of this little adventure for the amu&s;ement of the Ladies in que&s;tion. He wrote it in ballad mea&s;ure, and entitled it a Long Story: when it was handed about in manu&s;cript, nothing could be more various than the opinions concerning it; by &s;ome it was thought a ma&s;ter-piece of original humour, by others a wild and fanta&s;tic farrago; and when it was publi&s;hed, the &s;entiments of good judges were equally divided about it. How it came to be printed I &s;hall mention hereafter; and al&s;o
<PB N="212" REF="215">
inform the reader why Mr. Gray rejected it in the collection which he him&s;elf made of his Poems: In the meanwhile, as I think it ought to have a place in the&s;e Memoirs, for rea&s;ons too obvious to in&s;i&s;t upon, I &s;hall beg leave to preface it with my own idea of the author's peculiar vein of humour; which, with my notes on the piece it&s;elf, may perhaps account in &s;ome &s;ort for the variety of opinions which people of acknowledged ta&s;te have formed concerning it.</P>
<P>Mr. Gray had not (in my opinion) either in his conver&s;ation or writing much of what is called <HI>pure</HI> humour; it was always &s;o much blended either with wit, fancy, or his own peculiar character, that it became equivocal, and hence not adapted to plea&s;e generally: It had more of the manner of Congreve than Addi&s;on; and we know where one per&s;on reli&s;hes my Lady Wi&s;hfort, there are thou&s;ands that admire Sir Roger de Cover|ley: It will not however from hence follow, that Lady Wi&s;h|fort is ill drawn; for my own part I think it one of the mo&s;t entertaining characters that ever was written. I know, how|ever, that it is commonly thought extravagant and unnatural; and I believe it is true, that no woman ever exi&s;ted who had &s;o much folly and affectation, and at the &s;ame &s;o much wit and fancy; yet every one &s;ees that were this fancy and wit taken away, her character would become in&s;ipid, in proportion as it became more natural; &s;o that, in this and other in&s;tances, <HI>if Congreve's fools were fools indeed,</HI> they would, by being <HI>true</HI> characters, cea&s;e to be <HI>entertaining</HI> ones. It may be further ob|&s;erved on the &s;ubject of humour, that it may and ought to be divided into &s;everal &s;pecies: there is one &s;ort, that of Terence's, which &s;imply plea&s;es without forcing a &s;mile; another, like
<PB N="213" REF="216">
Mr. Addi&s;on's, which not only plea&s;es, but makes us &s;mile into the bargain. Shake&s;pear's, Swift's, Congreve's, and Prior's u&s;ually go further, and make us laugh: I infer not from hence that this latter &s;ort is the be&s;t: I only a&s;&s;ert, that however it may be mixt with other ingredients, it ought al&s;o to be called Humour. The critic, however, who judges by rule, and who will not be plea&s;ed unle&s;s legitimately, will be apt to condemn this &s;pecies of mixt humour; and the common reader will not always have either wit or imagination enough to comprehend or ta&s;te it. But I have &s;aid Mr. Gray not only mixed wit and fancy with his humour, but al&s;o his own particular character; and being naturally delicate, and at times even fa&s;tidious, his humour generally took the &s;ame ca&s;t; and would therefore be only reli&s;hed by &s;uch of his friends, who, con&s;cious of his &s;u|perior excellencies, thought this defect not only pardonable but entertaining, which a character of this &s;ort (being humorous in it&s;elf) always is, when it is not carried to any offen&s;ive ex|treme. Yet as this ob&s;ervation relates only to his conver&s;ation and familiar letters, (for to the&s;e only it can be applied) I have no occa&s;ion to in&s;i&s;t on it further; and &s;hall only add, that whatever the generality of readers may think of Mr. Gray's talent in this way, there will always be &s;ome, and tho&s;e far from the lowe&s;t cla&s;s, to whom it will appear excellent: for humour may be true, when it cea&s;es to be pure or unmixt, if the ingredients which go to its compo&s;ition be true al&s;o. Fal&s;e wit and a wild fancy would deba&s;e the be&s;t humour in the world, as they frequently do in Rabelais and Sterne (without taking more exceptionable matters into con&s;ideration); but when ge|nuine, they &s;erve to heighten and embelli&s;h it.</P>

The de&s;cription of the &s;pell, I know, has appeared to many per&s;ons ab&s;olutely unintelligible; yet if the reader adverts to that peculiar idea which runs through the whole, I imagine the ob&s;curity complained of will be removed. An incident, we &s;ee, &s;o &s;light as the &s;imple matter of fact, required &s;omething like machinery to enliven it: Accordingly the author cho&s;e, with pro|priety enough, to employ for that purpo&s;e tho&s;e notions of witchcraft, gho&s;ts, and enchantment, which prevailed at the time when the man&s;ion-hou&s;e was built. He de&s;cribes him&s;elf as a daemon of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s, <HI>a wicked imp who lamed the deer,</HI> &amp;c. again&s;t who&s;e malevolent power Lady Cobham (the Gloriana of the piece) employs two &s;uperior enchantre&s;&s;es. Congruity of imagery, there|fore, required the card they left upon the table to be converted into a &s;pell. Now all the old writers, on the&s;e &s;ubjects, are very minute in de&s;cribing the materials of &s;uch tali&s;mans. Hence, therefore, his grote&s;que idea of a compo|&s;ition of tran&s;parent bird-lime, edged with invi&s;ible chains in order to catch and draw him to the tribunal. Without going further for examples of this kind of imagery than the Poet's own works, let me in&s;tance two pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;erious kind, &s;imilar to this ludicrous one. In his Ode, entitled the Bard,
<Q><L>" Above, below, the ro&s;e of &s;now, &amp;c."</L></Q>
And, again, in the Fatal Si&s;ters,
<Q><L>" See the grie&s;ly texture grow."</L></Q>
It mu&s;t, however, be allowed, that no per&s;on can fully reli&s;h this burle&s;que, who is not much conver&s;ant with the old romance-writers, and with the Poets who formed them&s;elves on their model.</NOTE> But left a &s;pell upon the table.</L>

<P>HAVE you read Madame de Maintenon's letters? They are undoubtedly genuine; they begin very early in her life, before &s;he married Scarron, and continue after the king's death to within a little while of her own: they bear all the marks of a noble &s;pirit (in her adver&s;ity particularly) of virtue and unaffected devotion; in&s;omuch, that I am almo&s;t per&s;uaded &s;he was actually married to Lewis the XIV. and never his Mi&s;tre&s;s: and this not out of any policy or ambition, but con&s;cience: for &s;he was what we &s;hould call a bigot, yet with great good &s;en&s;e: In &s;hort, &s;he was too good for a court. Mi&s;|fortunes in the beginning of her life had formed her mind (naturally lively and impatient) to reflection and a habit of piety. She was always mi&s;erable while &s;he had the care of Madame de Monte&s;pan's children; timid and very cautious of making u&s;e of that unlimited power &s;he ro&s;e to afterwards, for fear of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the king's friend&s;hip for her; and after his death not at all afraid of meeting her own.</P>
<P>I do not know what to &s;ay to you with regard to Racine; it &s;ounds to me as if any body &s;hould fall upon Shake&s;pear, who indeed lies infinitely more open to critici&s;m of all kinds; but I &s;hould not care to be the per&s;on that undertook it.

</LETTER>
<P>While Mr. Bentley was employed in making the De&s;igns mentioned in the preceding letter, Mr. Gray, who greatly ad|mired not only the elegance of his fancy, but al&s;o the neatne&s;s as well as facility of his execution, began a complimentary poem to him, which I &s;hall now in&s;ert. Many readers will perhaps think the panegyric carried too far; as I own I did when he fir&s;t &s;hewed it me. Yet it is but ju&s;tice to declare, that the original drawings, now in Mr. Walpole's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which I have &s;ince &s;een, are &s;o infinitely &s;uperior to the publi&s;hed en|gravings of them, that a per&s;on, who has only &s;een the latter, can by no means judge of the excellencies of the former: Be&s;ides, there is &s;o much of grote&s;que fancy in the De&s;igns them&s;elves, that it can be no great matter of wonder (even if the engravers had done ju&s;tice to them) that they failed to plea&s;e univer&s;ally. What I have &s;aid in defence of the Long Story might ea&s;ily be applied to the&s;e productions of the &s;i&s;ter art: But not to detain the reader from the peru&s;al of a frag|ment, many &s;tanzas of which are equal in poetical merit to

The Egyp|tian &s;tyle (&s;ee Dr. Pococke, not his di&s;cour&s;es, but his prints) was apparently the mother of the Greek; and there is &s;uch a &s;imilitude between the Egyptian and tho&s;e Per&s;ian ruins, as gave Diodorus room to affirm, that the old buildings of Per&s;ia were certainly performed by Egyptian arti&s;ts: As to the other part of your friend's opinion, that the Gothic manner is the Saracen or Moori&s;h, he has a great authority to &s;upport him, that of Sir Chri&s;topher Wren; and yet I cannot help thinking it undoubtedly wrong. The palaces in Spain I never &s;aw but in de&s;cription, which gives us little or no idea of things; but the Doge's palace at Venice I have &s;een, which is in the Ara|be&s;que manner: And the hou&s;es of Barbary you may &s;ee in Dr. Shaw's book, not to mention abundance of other Ea&s;tern build|ings in Turkey, Per&s;ia, &amp;c. that we have views of; and they &s;eem plainly to be corruptions of the Greek architecture, broke into little parts indeed, and covered with little ornaments, but in a ta&s;te very di&s;tingui&s;hable from that which we call Gothic. There is one thing that runs through the Moori&s;h buildings that an imitator would certainly have been fir&s;t &s;truck with, and would have tried to copy; and that is the cupolas which cover every thing, baths, apartments, and even kitchens; yet who ever &s;aw a Gothic cupola? It is a thing plainly of Greek original. I do not &s;ee any thing but the &s;lender &s;pires that &s;erve for &s;teeples, which may perhaps be borrowed from the Saracen minarets on their mo&s;ques.</P>

<P>I Do not pretend to humble any one's pride; I love my own too well to attempt it. As to mortifying their vanity, it is too ea&s;y and too mean a ta&s;k for me to delight in. You are very good in &s;hewing &s;o much &s;en&s;ibility on my account; but be a&s;&s;ured my ta&s;te for prai&s;e is not like that of children for fruit; if there were nothing but medlars and black-berries in the world, I could be very well content to go without any at all. I dare &s;ay that Ma&s;on, though &s;ome years younger than I, was as little elevated with the approbation of Lord * and Lord *, as I am mortified by their &s;ilence.</P>
<P>With regard to publi&s;hing, I am not &s;o much again&s;t the thing it&s;elf, as of publi&s;hing this Ode alone<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">His Ode on the progre&s;s of Poetry.</NOTE>. I have two or three ideas more in my head; what is to come of them? Mu&s;t they too come out in the &s;hape of little &s;ixpenny flams, drop|ping one after another till Mr. Dod&s;ley thinks fit to collect them with Mr. This's Song, and Mr. Tother's Epigram, into a pretty volume? I am &s;ure Ma&s;on mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of this, and
<PB N="233" REF="236">
therefore cannot mean what he &s;ays; neither am I quite of your opinion with regard to &s;trophe and anti&s;trophe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He often made the &s;ame remark to me in conver&s;ation, which led me to form the la&s;t Ode of Caractacus in &s;horter &s;tanzas: But we mu&s;t not imagine that he thought the regular Pindaric method without its u&s;e; though, as he ju&s;tly &s;ays, when formed in long &s;tanzas, it does not fully &s;ucceed in point of effect on the ear: For there was nothing which he more di&s;liked than that chain of irre|gular &s;tanzas which Cowley introduced, and fal&s;ely called Pindaric; and which from the extreme facility of execution produced a number of mi&s;erable imitators. Had the regular return of Strophe, Anti&s;trophe, and Epode no other merit than that of extreme difficulty, it ought, on this very account, to be valued; becau&s;e we well know that <Q REND="inline">"Ea&s;y writing is no ea&s;y reading."</Q> It is al&s;o to be remarked, that Mr. Congreve, who (though without any lyrical powers) fir&s;t introduced the regular Pindaric form into the Engli&s;h language, made u&s;e of the &s;hort &s;tanzas which Mr. Gray here recommends.
<BIBL>See his Ode to the Queen: Works, vol. III. p. 438, Ed. Birm.</BIBL></NOTE>; &s;etting a&s;ide the difficulty of execution, methinks it has little or no effect on the ear, which &s;carce perceives the regular return of metres at &s;o great a di&s;tance from one another: to make it &s;ucceed, I am per&s;uaded the &s;tanzas mu&s;t not con&s;i&s;t of above nine lines each at the mo&s;t. Pindar has &s;everal &s;uch Odes.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Gray intimates, in the foregoing letter, that he had two or three more lyrical ideas in his head: One of the&s;e was the BARD, the exordium of which was at this time fini&s;hed; I &s;ay fini&s;hed, becau&s;e his conceptions, as well as his manner of di&s;|po&s;ing them, were &s;o &s;ingularly exact, that he had &s;eldom oc|ca&s;ion to make many, except verbal emendations, after he had fir&s;t committed his lines to paper. It was never his method to &s;ketch his general de&s;ign in carele&s;s ver&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I have many of his critical letters by me on my own compo&s;itions: Letters which, though they would not much amu&s;e the public in general, contain excel|lent le&s;&s;ons for young poets, from one of the&s;e I extract the following pa&s;&s;age, which &s;eems to explain this matter more fully: <Q REND="inline">"Extreme conci&s;ene&s;s of expre&s;|&s;ion, yet pure, per&s;picuous, and mu&s;ical, is one of the grand beauties of lyric poetry: This I have always aimed at, and never could attain. The nece&s;&s;ity of rhyming is one great ob&s;tacle to it: Another, and perhaps a &s;tronger, is that way you have cho&s;en, of ca&s;ting down your fir&s;t thoughts carele&s;sly and at large, and then clipping them here and there at lei&s;ure. This method, after all po&s;&s;ible pains, will leave behind it a laxity, a diffu&s;ene&s;s. The frame of a thought (otherwi&s;e well-invented, well-turned, and well-placed) is often weak|ened by it. Do I talk non&s;en&s;e? Or do you under&s;tand me? I am per&s;uaded what I &s;ay is true in my head, whatever it may be in pro&s;e; for I do not pre|tend to write pro&s;e."</Q> Nothing can be more ju&s;t than this remark: Yet, as I &s;ay above, it is a mode of writing which is only calculated for &s;maller compo&s;i|tions: But Mr. Gray, though he applied it here to an Ode, was apt to think it a general rule. Now if an epic or dramatic poet was to re&s;olve to fini&s;h every part of his work as highly as we have &s;een Mr. Gray laboured his fir&s;t &s;cene of Agrippina, I am apt to think he would tire of it as &s;oon as he did; for in the cour&s;e of &s;o multifarious a work, he would find him&s;elf obliged to expunge &s;ome of the be&s;t written parts, in order to pre&s;erve the unity of the whole. I know only one way to prevent this, and that was the method which Racine followed; who (as his &s;on tells us, in that amu&s;ing life, though much ze&s;ted with bigotry, which he has given us of his father) when he began a drama, di&s;po&s;ed every part of it accurately in pro&s;e; and when he had connected all the &s;cenes together, u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"Ma Tragedie e&s;t faite."</Q> (See La vie de Jean Racine, p. 117. See al&s;o his &s;on's other works, tom. 2d, for a &s;pecimen in a fir&s;t act of the Iphigenia in Tauris.) M. Racine, it &s;eems, was an ea&s;y ver&s;ifier in a language in which, they &s;ay, it is more difficult than in ours to ver&s;ify. It certainly is &s;o with regard to dramatic compo&s;itions. I am on this account per&s;uaded, that if the great Poet had written in Engli&s;h, he would have drawn out his fir&s;t &s;ketches, not in pro&s;e, but in carele&s;s blank ver&s;e; yet this I give as mere matter of opinion.</NOTE>, he always fini&s;hed
<PB N="234" REF="237">
as he proceeded; this, tho' it made his execution &s;low, made his compo&s;itions more perfect. I think, however, that this method was only calculated to produce &s;uch &s;hort works as generally employed his poetical pen; and that from pur|&s;uing it, he grew tired of his larger de&s;igns before he had completed them. The fact &s;eems to ju&s;tify my opinion. But
<PB N="235" REF="238">
my principal rea&s;on for mentioning this at pre&s;ent, is to explain the cau&s;e why I have not been &s;crupulous in publi&s;hing &s;o many of his fragments in the cour&s;e of the&s;e memoirs. It would have been unpardonable in me to have taken this liberty with a decea&s;ed friend, had I not found his lines, as far as they went, nearly as high fini&s;hed as they would have been, when com|pleted: if I am mi&s;taken in this, I hope the reader will rather impute it to a defect in my own Judgment, than a want of re&s;pect to Mr. Gray's Memory.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration, however, emboldens me to print the following fragment of an Ode in this place, which was unque|&s;tionably another of the ideas, alluded to in the preceding letter: Since I find in his memorandum-book, of the preceding year 1754, a &s;ketch of his de&s;ign as follows: <Q REND="inline">"Contra&s;t between the winter pa&s;t and coming &s;pring.&mdash;Joy owing to that vici&s;|&s;itude.&mdash;Many who never feel that delight.&mdash;Sloth.&mdash;Envy. Ambition. How much happier the ru&s;tic who feels it, tho' he knows not how."</Q> I print this carele&s;s note, in order that the reader may conceive the intended arrangement of the whole; who, I doubt not, will, on peru&s;ing the following beautiful &s;tanzas, lament with me that he left it incomplete; nor will it con&s;ole him for the lo&s;s, if I tell him that I have had the boldne&s;s to attempt to fini&s;h it my&s;elf, making u&s;e of &s;ome other lines and broken &s;tanzas which he had written: But as my aim in undertaking this difficult ta&s;k was merely to eluci|date the Poet's general meaning, I do not think that my addi|tions are worthy to be in&s;erted in this place; they will find a more fit &s;ituation if thrown among&s;t tho&s;e notes which I &s;hall put at the end of his Poems.</P>

<P>A third of the&s;e ideas I find in his common-place book, on the &s;ame page with his argument for the BARD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;hall in&s;ert this, with &s;ome remarks upon it, in my additional notes to his Poems.</NOTE>. I do not
<PB N="238" REF="241">
believe that he ever even began to compo&s;e the Ode it&s;elf; but the thought is as follows:</P>
<Q>"All that men of power can do for men of genius is to leave them at their liberty, compared to birds that, when confined to a cage, do but regret the lo&s;s of their freedom in melan|choly &s;trains, and lo&s;e the lu&s;cious wildne&s;s and happy luxu|riance of their notes, which u&s;ed to make the woods re|&s;ound."</Q>
<P>Tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant in the arrangement of a lyrical compo&s;ition, will ea&s;ily perceive, from this &s;hort argument, that the Ode would have opened with the &s;imile; which, when adorned with tho&s;e <HI>thoughts that breathe and words that burn,</HI> that Mr. Gray's mu&s;e could &s;o richly &s;upply, would have been at once a fine exordium, and at the &s;ame time a natural intro|duction to the truth he meant to impre&s;s. This, however, could hardly have been done without &s;ome little aid borrowed from &s;atire: For however true his propo&s;ition may be, that <Q REND="inline">"all that men of power can do for men of genius is to leave them at their liberty;"</Q> or, as I &s;hould put it, <Q REND="inline">"that their be&s;t patronage &s;ignifies nothing if it abridges them of that liberty;"</Q> yet the fact is, that neither of the parties are convinced of this truth till they have tried the experiment, and find &s;ome rea&s;on or other (no matter whether good or bad) to think they had better never have tried it. Mon&s;. d'Alembert, who has written an excellent e&s;&s;ay on this &s;ubject, which Mr. Gray greatly ad|mired, and which perhaps gave him the fir&s;t idea of this intended Ode, puts one of the more common of the&s;e rea&s;ons in &s;o lively a manner, that it may not be ami&s;s here to in&s;ert it.</P>

He proves al&s;o by many affecting examples, that an Antiquary may be mi&s;taken: That, for any thing any body knows, this place under ground might be &s;ome other place, and not Herculaneum; but neverthele&s;s, that he can &s;hew for certain, that it was this place and no other place; that it is hard to &s;ay which of the &s;everal Hercules's was the founder; therefore (in the third volume) he promi&s;es to give us the me|moirs of them all; and after that, if we do not know what to think of the matter, he will tell us.

cannot agree with you in thinking Him or his Ma&s;ter two of the be&s;t men in the world.

<P>THOUGH I allow abundance for your kindne&s;s and partiality to me, I am yet much plea&s;ed with the good opinion you &s;eem to have of the Bard: I have not, however, done a word more than the little you have &s;een, having been in a very li&s;tle&s;s, unplea&s;ant, and <HI>inutile</HI> &s;tate of mind for this long time, for which I &s;hall beg you to pre&s;cribe me &s;omewhat &s;trengthening and agglutinant, le&s;t it turn to a confirmed Pthi&s;is.</P>
<P>I recommend two little French books to you, one called Memoirs de M. de la Porte; it has all the air of &s;implicity and truth, and contains &s;ome few very extraordinary facts re|lating to Anne of Au&s;tria and Cardinal Mazarine. The other is in two &s;mall volumes, <Q REND="inline">"Memoirs de Madame Staal."</Q> The facts are no great matter, but the manner and vivacity make them intere&s;ting. She was a &s;ort of Confidante to the late Dutche&s;s of Maine, and impri&s;oned a long time on her account during the regency.</P>
<P>I ought before now to have thanked you for your kind offer, which I mean &s;oon to accept, for a rea&s;on which to be &s;ure can be none to you and Mrs. Wharton; and therefore I think it my duty to give you notice of it. I have told you already of my mental ailments; and it is a very po&s;&s;ible thing al&s;o that I may be bodily ill again in town, which I would not chu&s;e to
<PB N="245" REF="248">
be in a dirty inconvenient lodging, where, perhaps, my nur&s;e might &s;tifle me with a pillow; and therefore it is no wonder if I prefer your hou&s;e: but I tell you of this in time, that if either of you are frightened at the thoughts of a &s;ick body, you may make a hand&s;ome excu&s;e and &s;ave your&s;elves this trouble. You are not however to imagine my illne&s;s is <HI>in e&s;&s;e;</HI> no, it is only <HI>in po&s;&s;e;</HI> otherwi&s;e I &s;hould be &s;crupulous of bring|ing it home to you. I think I &s;hall be with you in about a fortnight.</P>

<P>I Feel a contrition for my long &s;ilence; and yet perhaps it is the la&s;t thing you trouble your head about. Neverthele&s;s I will be as &s;orry as if you took it ill. I am &s;orry too to &s;ee you &s;o punctilious as to &s;tand upon an&s;wers, and never to come near me till I have regularly left my name at your door, like a Mercer's Wife, that imitates people who go a vi&s;iting. I would forgive you this, if you could po&s;&s;ibly &s;u&s;pect I were doing any thing that I liked better; for then your formality might look like being piqued at my negligence, which has &s;omewhat in it like kindne&s;s: But you know I am at Stoke, hearing, &s;eeing, doing ab&s;olutely nothing. Not &s;uch a nothing as you do at Tunbridge, chequered and diver&s;i&s;ied with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fleet|ing

I have had no more mu&s;cular inflations, and am only troubled with this depre&s;&s;ion of mind. You will not expect therefore I &s;hould give you any account of my <HI>Verve,</HI> which is at be&s;t (you know) of &s;o delicate a con&s;titution, and has &s;uch weak nerves, as not to &s;tir out of its chamber above three days in a year. But I &s;hall enquire after yours, and why it is off again? It has certainly wor&s;e nerves than mine, if your Reviewers have frighted it. Sure I (not to mention a &s;core of your other Critics) am &s;omething a better Judge than all the Man-Midwives and Pre&s;byterian Par&s;ons<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Reviewers, at the time, were &s;uppo&s;ed to be of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions.</NOTE> that ever were born. Pray give me leave to a&s;k you, do you find your&s;elf tickled with the commendations of &s;uch people? (for you have your &s;hare of the&s;e too) I dare &s;ay not; your Vanity has certainly a better ta&s;te. And can then the cen&s;ure of &s;uch critics move you? I own it is an impertinence in the&s;e gentry to talk of one at all either in good or in bad; but this we mu&s;t all &s;wallow: I mean not only we that write, but all the <HI>we's</HI> that ever did any thing to be talked of.</P>
<P>While I am writing I receive yours, and rejoice to find that the genial influences of this fine &s;ea&s;on, which produce nothing in me, have hatched high and unimaginable fanta&s;ies in you.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I had &s;ent him my fir&s;t idea of Caractacus, drawn out in a &s;hort argument.</NOTE> I &s;ee, methinks, as I &s;it on Snowdon, &s;ome glimp&s;e of Mona and

Any Druidical anecdotes that I can meet with, I will be &s;ure to &s;end you when I return to Cambridge; but I cannot pretend to be learned without books, or to know the Druids from modern Bi&s;hops at this di&s;tance. I can only tell you not to go and take Mona for the I&s;le of Man: it is Angle&s;ey, a tract of plain country, very fertile, but picture&s;que only from the view it has of Caernarvon&s;hire, from which it is &s;eparated by the Mena&iuml;, a narrow arm of the &s;ea. Forgive me for &s;uppo&s;ing in you &s;uch a want of erudition.</P>
<P>I congratulate you on our glorious &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the Mediter|ranean. Shall we go in time, and hire a hou&s;e together in Switzerland? It is a fine poetical country to look at, and no body there will under&s;tand a word we &s;ay or write.</P>

<P>YOU are &s;o forgetful of me that I &s;hould not forgive it, but that I &s;uppo&s;e Caractacus may be the better for it. Yet I hear nothing from him neither, in &s;pite of his promi&s;es: there is no faith in man, no not in a Welchman; and yet Mr. Parry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A capital performer on the Welch Harp, and who was either born blind, or had been &s;o from his infancy.</NOTE> has been here, and &s;cratched out &s;uch ravi&s;hing blind harmony, &s;uch tunes of a thou&s;and years old, with names
<PB N="248" REF="251">
enough to choak you, as have &s;et all this learned Body a dan|cing, and in&s;pired them with due reverence for my old Bard his countryman, whenever he &s;hall appear. Mr. Parry, you mu&s;t know, has put my Ode in motion again, and has brought it at la&s;t to a conclu&s;ion. 'Tis to him, therefore, that you owe the treat which I &s;end you enclo&s;ed; namely, the brea&s;t and merry-thought, and rump too of the chicken which I have been chewing &s;o long, that I would give the world for neck|beef or cow-heel.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve, in the beginning of this thing, &s;ome alte|rations of a few words, partly for improvement, and partly to avoid repetitions of like words and rhymes; yet I have not got rid of them all; the &s;ix la&s;t lines of the fifth &s;tanza are new, tell me whether they will do. I am well aware of many weakly things towards the conclu&s;ion, but I hope the end it&s;elf will do; give me your full and true opinion, and that not upon delibe|ration, but forthwith. Mr. Hurd him&s;elf allows that <HI>Lyon port</HI> is not too bold for Queen Elizabeth.</P>
<P>I have got the old Scotch Ballad on which Douglas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He had a high opinion of this fir&s;t Drama of Mr. Home.

<P>I Do not know why you &s;hould thank me for what you had a right and title to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A pre&s;ent of his two Pindaric Odes ju&s;t then publi&s;hed.</NOTE>; but attribute it to the exce&s;s of your politene&s;s; and the more &s;o, becau&s;e almo&s;t no one el&s;e has made me the &s;ame compliment. As your acquaintance in the Univer&s;ity (you &s;ay) do me the honour to <HI>admire,</HI> it would be ungenerous in me not to give them notice, that they are do|ing a very unfa&s;hionable thing; for all People of Condition are agreed not to admire, nor even to under&s;tand.

topics of con&s;olation on that head. In &s;hort, I have heard of no body but an Actor and a Doctor of Divinity that profe&s;s their e&s;teem for them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">An extract from a letter to Dr. Wharton, dated October 7, 1757, will explain this: <Q REND="inline">"Dr. Warburton is come to town, and I am told likes them ex|tremely; he &s;ays the world never pa&s;&s;ed &s;o ju&s;t an opinion upon any thing as upon them; for that in other things they have affected to like or di&s;like: where|as here they own they do not under&s;tand, which he looks upon to be very true; but yet thinks they under&s;tand them as well as Milton or Shake&s;pear, whom they are obliged, by fa&s;hion, to admire. Mr. Garrick's complimentary ver&s;es to me you have &s;een; I am told they were printed in the Chronicle of la&s;t Sa|turday. The Critical Review is in raptures; but mi&s;takes the Aeolian Lyre for the Harp of Aeolus, and on this plea&s;ant error founds both a compliment and a critici&s;m.

<P>From this mention of Ma&s;on's name you may think, per|haps, we are great corre&s;pondents. No &s;uch thing; I have not heard from him the&s;e two months.

no great malady, but &s;everal little ones, that &s;eem brewing no good to me.

<P>I Have (as I de&s;ired Mr. Stonhewer to tell you) read over Ca|ractacus twice, not with plea&s;ure only, but with emotion. You may &s;ay what you will; but the contrivance, the manners, the intere&s;ts, the pa&s;&s;ions, and the expre&s;&s;ion, go beyond the dra|matic part<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the manu&s;cript now before him, Mr. Gray had only the fir&s;t Ode, the others were not then written; and although the dramatic part was brought to a conclu&s;ion, yet it was afterwards in many places altered. He was mi&s;taken with regard to the opinion the world would have about it. That world, which u&s;ually loves to be led in &s;uch matters, rather than form an opinion for it&s;elf, was taught a different &s;entiment; and one of its leaders went &s;o far as to declare, that he never knew a &s;econd work fall &s;o much below a fir&s;t from the &s;ame hand. To oppo&s;e Mr. Gray's judgment to his, I mu&s;t own gives me &s;ome &s;atisfaction; and to enjoy it I am willing to ri&s;k that imputation of vanity, which may probably fall to my &s;hare for having publi&s;hed this Letter. I mu&s;t add, however, that &s;ome of my friends advi&s;ed it for the &s;ake of the more <HI>general</HI> critici&s;ms which they thought too valuable to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> of your Elfrida, many many leagues. I even &s;ay (though you will think me a bad judge of this) that the <HI>World</HI> will like it better. I am &s;truck with the Chorus, who are not
<PB N="252" REF="255">
there merely to &s;ing and dance, but bear throughout a principal part in the action; and have (be&s;ide the <HI>Co&s;tume,</HI> which is ex|cellent) as much a character of their own, as any other per&s;on. I am charmed with their prie&s;tly pride and ob&s;tinacy, when, after all is lo&s;t, they re&s;olve to confront the Roman General, and &s;pit in his face. But now I am going to tell you what touches me mo&s;t from the beginning. The fir&s;t opening is greatly improved: the curio&s;ity of Didius is now a very natu|ral rea&s;on for dwelling on each particular of the &s;cene before him; nor is the de&s;cription at all too long. I am glad to find the two young men are Carti&s;mandua's &s;ons. They intere&s;t me far more. I love people of condition. They were men before that no body knew: one could not make them a bow if one had met them at a public place.</P>
<P>I always admired that interruption of the Druids to Evelina, <HI>Peace, virgin, peace,</HI> &amp;c. and chiefly the <HI>ab&s;tract idea per&s;oni|fied</HI> (to u&s;e the words of a Critic) at the end of it. That of Caractacus, <HI>Would &s;ave my Queen,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;till more that, <HI>I know it, reverend Fathers; 'tis Heav'n's high will,</HI> &amp;c. to <HI>I've done, begin the rites!</HI> This latter is exemplary for the ex|pre&s;&s;ion (always the great point with me); I do not mean by expre&s;&s;ion the mere choice of words, but the whole dre&s;s, fa|&s;hion, and arrangement of a thought. Here, in particular, it is the brokenne&s;s, the ungrammatical po&s;ition, the total &s;ub|ver&s;ion of the period that charms me. All that u&s;hers in the incantation from <HI>Try we yet, what holine&s;s can do,</HI> I am delight|ed with in quite another way; for this is pure poetry, as it ought to be, forming the proper tran&s;ition, and leading on the mind to that &s;till purer poetry that follows it.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="256">
In the beginning of the &s;ucceeding act I admire the Chorus again, <HI>Is it not now the hour, the holy hour,</HI> &amp;c. and their eva&s;ion of a lie, <HI>Say'&s;t thou, proud Boy,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>&s;leep with the un&s;un'd &s;ilver,</HI> which is an example of a dramatic &s;imile. The &s;udden appearance of Caractacus, the pretended re&s;pect and admiration of Vellinus, and the probability of his &s;tory, the di&s;tru&s;t of the Druids, and their rea&s;oning with Caractacus, and particularly that, <HI>'Tis meet thou &s;hould'&s;t, thou art a King,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>Mark me, Prince, the time will come, when De&s;tiny,</HI> &amp;c. are well, and happily imagined. A-propos of the la&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;age I have mentioned, I am going to make a digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When we treat a &s;ubject, where the manners are almo&s;t lo&s;t in antiquity, our &s;tock of ideas mu&s;t needs be &s;mall; and nothing betrays our poverty more, than the returning to, and harping frequently on, one image. It was therefore I thought you &s;hould omit &s;ome lines before, though good in them&s;elves, about the <HI>&s;cythed car,</HI> that the pa&s;&s;age now before us might appear with greater lu&s;tre when it came; and in this I &s;ee you have complied with me. But there are other ideas here and there &s;till, that occur too often, particularly about <HI>the Oaks,</HI> &s;ome of which I would di&s;card to make way for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But the &s;ubjects I &s;peak of to compen&s;ate (and more than compen&s;ate) that unavoidable poverty, have one great advan|tage when they fall into good hands. They leave an unbound|ed liberty to pure imagination and fiction, (our favourite pro|vinces) where no Critic can mole&s;t, or Antiquary gain&s;ay us; and yet (to plea&s;e me) the&s;e fictions mu&s;t have &s;ome affinity, &s;ome &s;eeming <HI>connexion,</HI> with that little we really know of the
<PB N="254" REF="257">
character and cu&s;toms of the people. For example, I never heard in my days that Midnight and the Moon were Si&s;ters; that they carried rods of ebony and gold, or met to whi&s;per on the top of a mountain: but now I could lay my life it is all true; and do not doubt it will be found &s;o in &s;ome Pantheon of the Druids, that is to be di&s;covered in the Library at Herculaneum. The <HI>Car of De&s;tiny and Death</HI> is a very noble invention of the &s;ame cla&s;s, and, as far as that goes, is &s;o fine, that it makes me more delicate, than perhaps I &s;hould be, about the clo&s;e of it. <HI>Andra&s;te &s;ailing on the wings of Fame,</HI> that &s;natches the wreaths from oblivion to hang them on her loftie&s;t Amaranth, though a clear and beautiful piece of <HI>unknown</HI> Mythology, has too <HI>Greek</HI> an air to give me perfect &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Now I proceed. The preparation to the Chorus, though &s;o much akin to that in the former act, is excellent. The re|marks of Evelina and her &s;u&s;picions of the Brothers, mixed with a &s;ecret inclination to the younger of them, (though, I think, her part throughout wants retouching) yet plea&s;e me much, and the contrivance of the following &s;cene much more. <HI>Ma|&s;ters of Wi&s;dom, no,</HI> &amp;c. I always admired; as I do the rock|ing &s;tone, and the di&s;tre&s;s of Elidurus. Evelina's examination of his is a well-invented &s;cene, and will be, with a little pains, a very touching one: but the introduction of Arviragus is &s;uperlative. I am not &s;ure whether tho&s;e few lines of his &s;hort narrative, <HI>My &s;trength repair'd, it boots not, that I tell,</HI> &amp;c. do not plea&s;e me as much as any thing in the whole Drama. The &s;ullen bravery of Elidurus, the menaces of the Chorus, that <HI>Think not, Religion,</HI> &amp;c. the Trumpet of the Druids, that <HI>I'll follow him, tho' in my chains, &amp;c. Ha&s;t thou a Brother, no,</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="258">
&amp;c. the placability of the Chorus, when they &s;ee the motives of Elidurus's ob&s;tinacy, give me great contentment: &s;o do the reflections of the Druid on the nece&s;&s;ity of lu&s;tration, and the rea&s;ons for Vellinus's ea&s;y e&s;cape; but I would not have him <HI>&s;eize on a &s;pear,</HI> nor <HI>i&s;&s;ue ha&s;ty thro' the cavern's mouth.</HI> Why &s;hould he not &s;teal away, una&s;ked and unmi&s;&s;ed, till the hurry of pa&s;&s;ions in tho&s;e, that &s;hould have guarded him, was a little abated? But I chiefly admire the two &s;peeches of Eli|durus; <HI>Ah, Vellinus, is this then,</HI> &amp;c. and, <HI>Ye do gaze on me, Fathers,</HI> &amp;c. the manner in which the Chorus reply to him is very fine; but the image at the end wants a little mending. The next &s;cene is highly moving! it is &s;o very good, that I mu&s;t have it made yet better.</P>
<P>Now for the la&s;t act. I do not know what you would have; but to me the de&s;ign and contrivance of it is at lea&s;t equal to any part of the whole. The &s;hort-lived triumph of the Bri|tons, the addre&s;s of Caractacus to the Roman Victims, Eveli|na's di&s;covery of the ambu&s;h, the mi&s;take of the Roman fires for the ri&s;ing &s;un, the death of Arviragus, the interview be|tween Didius and Caractacus, his mourning over his dead Son, his parting &s;peech, (in which you have made all the u&s;e of Ta|citus that your plan would admit) every thing, in &s;hort, but that little di&s;pute between Didius and him; <HI>'Tis well; and therefore to encrea&s;e that reverence,</HI> &amp;c. down to, <HI>Give me a mo|ment</HI> (which mu&s;t be omitted, or put in the mouth of the Druids) I approve in the highe&s;t degree. If I &s;hould find any fault with the la&s;t act, it could only be with trifles and little expre&s;&s;ions. If you make any alterations, I fear it will never improve it; I mean as to the plan. I &s;end you back the two
<PB N="256" REF="259">
la&s;t &s;heets, becau&s;e you bid me. I re&s;erve my nibblings and minutiae for another day.</P>

<P>A Life &s;pent out of the world has its hours of de&s;pondence, its inconveniencies, its &s;ufferings, as numerous and as real, though not quite of the &s;ame &s;ort, as a life &s;pent in the mid&s;t of it. The power we have, when we will exert it over our own minds, joined to a little &s;trength and con&s;olation, nay, a little pride we catch from tho&s;e that &s;eem to love us, is our only &s;upport in either of the&s;e conditions. I am &s;en&s;ible I can|not return you more of this a&s;&s;i&s;tance than I have received from you; and can only tell you, that one who has far more rea&s;on than you, I hope, ever will have to look on life with &s;ome|thing wor&s;e than indifference, is yet no enemy to it; but can look backward on many bitter moments, partly with &s;atisfac|tion, and partly with patience; and forward too, on a &s;cene not very promi&s;ing, with &s;ome hope, and &s;ome expectations of a better day. The cau&s;e, however, which occa&s;ioned your re|flection, (though I can judge but very imperfectly of it) does not &s;eem, at pre&s;ent, to be weighty enough to make you take any &s;uch re&s;olution as you meditate. U&s;e it in its &s;ea&s;on, as a relief from what is tire&s;ome to you, but not as if it was in con&s;equence of any thing you take ill; on the contrary, if &s;uch a thing had happened at the time of your tran&s;migration, I would defer it merely to avoid that appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="260">
As to my&s;elf, I cannot boa&s;t, at pre&s;ent, either of my &s;pirits, my &s;ituation, my employments, or fertility. The days and the nights pa&s;s, and I am never the nearer to any thing, but that one to which we are all tending; yet I love people that leave &s;ome traces of their journey behind them, and have &s;trength enough to advi&s;e you to do &s;o while you can. I expect to &s;ee Caractacus compleated, and therefore I &s;end you the books you wanted. I do not know whether they will furni&s;h you with any new matter; but they are well enough written, and ea&s;ily read. I told you before that (in a time of dearth) I would borrow from the Edda, without entering too minutely on par|ticulars: but, if I did &s;o, I would make each image &s;o clear, that it might be fully under&s;tood by it&s;elf; for in this ob&s;cure mythology we mu&s;t not hint at things, as we do with the Greek fables, that every body is &s;uppo&s;ed to know at &s;chool. How|ever, on &s;econd thoughts, I think it would be &s;till better to graft any wild picture&s;que fable, ab&s;olutely of one's own inven|tion, on the Druid-&s;tock; I mean on tho&s;e half dozen of old fan|cies that are known to be a part of their &s;y&s;tem. This will give you more freedom and latitude, and will leave no hold for the Critics to fa&s;ten on.</P>
<P>I &s;end you back the Elegy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Elegy in the Garden of a Friend.</NOTE> as you de&s;ired me to do. My advices are always at your &s;ervice to take or to refu&s;e, therefore you &s;hould not call them &s;evere. You know I do not love, much le&s;s pique my&s;elf on Critici&s;m; and think even a bad ver&s;e as good a thing or better than the be&s;t ob&s;ervation that ever was made upon it. I like greatly the &s;pirit and &s;entiment of it (much of which you perhaps owe to your pre&s;ent train of

thinking); the di&s;po&s;ition of the whole too is natural and ele|giac; as to the expre&s;&s;ion, I would venture to &s;ay (did not you forbid me) that it is &s;ometimes too ea&s;y. The la&s;t line I pro|te&s;t again&s;t (this, you will &s;ay, is wor&s;e than blotting out rhymes); the de&s;criptive part is excellent.</P>
<P>Pray, when did I pretend to fini&s;h, or even in&s;ert pa&s;&s;ages into other people's works, as if it were equally ea&s;y to pick holes and to mend them? All I can &s;ay is, that your Elegy mu&s;t not end with the wor&s;t line in it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It was endeavoured to be improved accordingly; how it &s;tood when this critici&s;m upon it was written, I cannot now recollect.</NOTE>. It is flat; it is pro&s;e; where|as that, above all, ought to &s;parkle, or at lea&s;t to &s;hine. If the &s;entiment mu&s;t &s;tand, twirl it a little into an apothegm; &s;tick a flower in it; gild it with a co&s;tly expre&s;&s;ion; let it &s;trike the fancy, the ear, or the heart, and I am &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>The other particular expre&s;&s;ions which I object to, I mark on the manu&s;cript. Now, I de&s;ire you would neither think me &s;evere, nor at all regard what I &s;ay further, than as it co|incides with your own judgment; for the child de&s;erves your partiality; it is a healthy well-made boy with an ingenuous countenance, and promi&s;es to live long.

<P>IT is indeed for want of &s;pirits, as you &s;u&s;pect, that my &s;tu|dies lie among the Cathedrals, and the Tombs, and the Ruins. To think, though to little purpo&s;e, has been the chief amu&s;ement of my days; and when I would not, or cannot think, I dream. At pre&s;ent I feel my&s;elf able to write a Cata|logue, or to read the Peerage book, or Miller's Gardening Dic|tionary, and am thankful that there are &s;uch employments and &s;uch authors in the world.

<P>To make a tran&s;ition from my&s;elf to as poor a &s;ubject, the Tragedy of Agis; I cry to think that it &s;hould be by the Au|thor of Douglas: Why, it is all modern Greek; the &s;tory is an antique &s;tatue painted white and red, frized, and dre&s;&s;ed in a neglig&eacute;e made by a York&s;hire mantua-maker. Then here is the Mi&s;cellany (Mr. Dod&s;ley has &s;ent me the whole &s;et gilt and lettered, I thank him). Why, the two la&s;t volumes are wor&s;e than the four fir&s;t; particularly Dr. Aken&s;ide is in a deplorable way<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have been told that this Writer, unque&s;tionably a man of great learning and genius, entertained, &s;ome years before his death, a notion that <HI>Poetry was only true eloquence in metre;</HI> and, according to this idea, wrote his Ode to the Country Gentlemen of England, and afterwards made con&s;iderable alterations in that collection of Odes which he had publi&s;hed in the earlier part of his life. We have &s;een in the &s;econd letter of this &s;ection, that Mr. Gray thought highly of his de&s;criptive talents at that time. We are not therefore to impute what he here &s;ays to any prejudice in the Critic, but to that change of ta&s;te in the Poet, which (if the above anecdote be true) would unavoidably flatten his de&s;criptions, and dive&s;t them of all picture&s;que imagery: nay, would &s;ometimes convert his ver&s;e into mere pro&s;e; or, what is wor&s;e, hard inflated pro&s;e.</NOTE>. What &s;ignifies Learning and the Antients, (Ma&s;on will &s;ay triumphantly) why &s;hould people read Greek to lo&s;e their imagination, their ear, and their mother tongue?

<P>I Am as &s;orry as you &s;eem to be, that our acquaintance harped &s;o much on the &s;ubject of materiali&s;m, when I &s;aw him with you in town, becau&s;e it was plain to which &s;ide of the long-debated que&s;tion he inclined. That we are indeed mechanical and dependent beings, I need no other proof than my own feelings; and from the &s;ame feelings I learn, with equal conviction, that we are not <HI>merely</HI> &s;uch: that there is a power within that &s;truggles again&s;t the force and bia&s;s of that mechani&s;m, commands its motion, and, by frequent practice, reduces it to that ready obedience which we call <HI>Habit;</HI> and all this in conformity to a preconceived opinion (no matter whether right or wrong) to that lea&s;t material of all agents, a Thought. I have known many in his ca&s;e who, while they thought they were conquering an old prejudice, did not perceive they were under the influence of one far more dangerous; one that fur|ni&s;hes us with a ready apology for all our wor&s;t actions, and opens to us a full licence for doing whatever we plea&s;e; and yet the&s;e very people were not at all the more indulgent to other men (as they naturally &s;hould have been), their indignation to
<PB N="263" REF="266">
&s;uch as offended them, their de&s;ire of revenge on any body that hurt them was nothing mitigated: In &s;hort, the truth is, they wi&s;hed to be per&s;uaded of that opinion for the &s;ake of its con|venience, but were not &s;o in their heart; and they would have been glad (as they ought in common prudence) that nobody el&s;e &s;hould think the &s;ame, for fear of the mi&s;chief that might en&s;ue to them&s;elves. His French Author I never &s;aw, but have read fifty in the &s;ame &s;train, and &s;hall read no more. I can be wretched enough without them. They put me in mind of the Greek Sophi&s;t that got immortal honour by di&s;cour&s;ing &s;o feelingly on the mi&s;eries of our condition, that fifty of his audience went home and hanged them&s;elves; yet he lived him|&s;elf (I &s;uppo&s;e) many years after in very good plight.</P>
<P>You &s;ay you cannot conceive how Lord Shafte&s;bury came to be a Philo&s;opher in vogue; I will tell you: Fir&s;t, he was a Lord; 2dly, he was as vain as any of his readers; 3dly, men are very prone to believe what they do not under&s;tand; 4thly, they will believe any thing at all, provided they are under no obli|gation to believe it; 5thly, they love to take a new road, even when that road leads no where; 6thly, he was reckoned a fine writer, and &s;eemed always to mean more than he &s;aid. Would you have any more rea&s;ons? An interval of above forty years has pretty well de&s;troyed the charm. A dead Lord ranks but with Commoners: Vanity is no longer intere&s;ted in the matter, for the new road is become an old one. The mode of free|thinking is like that of Ruffs and Farthingales, and has given place to the mode of not thinking at all; once it was reckoned graceful, half to di&s;cover and half conceal the mind, but now we have been long accu&s;tomed to &s;ee it quite naked: primne&s;s

<P>It will, I think, be no improper &s;upplement to the foregoing letter to in&s;ert a paper of Mr. Gray's, which contains &s;ome very pertinent &s;trictures on the writings of a later Lord, who was plea&s;ed to attack the moral attributes of the Deity; or, what amounted to the &s;ame thing, endeavoured to prove, <Q REND="inline">"that we have no adequate ideas of his goodne&s;s and ju&s;tice, as we have of his natural ones, his wi&s;dom and power."</Q> This po&s;ition the excellent author of the View of Lord Bolingbroke's Philo&s;ophy, calls the MAIN PILLAR of his &s;y&s;tem; and adds, in another place, that the FATE OF ALL RELIGION is included in this que&s;tion. On this important point, therefore, that able Writer has dwelt largely, and confuted his Lord&s;hip effectually. Some &s;ort of readers, however, who probably would &s;light that confutation, may regard the arguments of a Layman, and even a Poet, more than tho&s;e which are drawn up by the pen of a Divine and a Bi&s;hop: It is for the u&s;e of the&s;e that the paper is publi&s;hed; who, if they learn nothing el&s;e from it, will find that Mr. Gray was not of their party, nor &s;o great a wit as to di&s;|believe the exi&s;tence of a Deity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In one of his pocket-books I find a &s;light &s;ketch in ver&s;e of his own cha|racter, which may, on account of one line in it, come into a note here with &s;uf|cient propriety.

<P>This la&s;t line needs no comment for readers of the pre&s;ent time, and it &s;urely is not worth while to write one on this occa&s;ion for po&s;terity.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<Q><PB N="265" REF="268"><P>"I will allow Lord Bolingbroke, that the moral, as well as phy&s;ical, attributes of God mu&s;t be known to us only &agrave; po&s;te|riori, and that this is the only real knowledge we can have either of the one or the other; I will allow too that perhaps it may be an idle di&s;tinction which we make between them: His moral attributes being as much in his nature and e&s;&s;ence as tho&s;e we call his phy&s;ical; but the occa&s;ion of our making &s;ome di&s;tinction is plainly this: His eternity, infinity, omni&s;cience, and almighty power, are not what connect him, if I may &s;o &s;peak, with us his creatures. We adore him, not becau&s;e he always did in every place, and always will, exi&s;t; but becau&s;e he gave and &s;till pre&s;erves to us our own exi&s;tence by an exer|tion of his goodne&s;s. We adore him, not becau&s;e he knows and can do all things, but becau&s;e he made us capable of know|ing and of doing what may conduct us to happine&s;s: It is therefore his benevolence which we adore, not his greatne&s;s or power; and if we are made only to bear our part in a &s;y&s;tem, without any regard to our own particular happine&s;s, we can no longer wor&s;hip him as our all-bounteous parent: There is no meaning in the term. The idea of his malevolence (an im|piety I tremble to write) mu&s;t &s;ucceed. We have nothing left but our fears, and tho&s;e too vain; for whither can they lead but to de&s;pair and the &s;ad de&s;ire of annihilation. <Q REND="inline">"If then ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s be not the &s;ame in God as in our ideas, we mean nothing when we &s;ay that God is nece&s;&s;arily ju&s;t and good; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on it may as well be &s;aid that we know not what we mean when, according to Dr. Clarke, (Evid. 26th) we affirm that he is nece&s;&s;arily a wi&s;e and intelligent Being."</Q> What then can Lord Bolingbroke mean, when he &s;ays every thing &s;hews the wi&s;dom of God;
<PB N="266" REF="269">
and yet adds, every thing does not &s;hew in like manner the goodne&s;s of God conformably to our ideas of this attribute in either? By wi&s;dom he mu&s;t only mean, that God knows and employs the fitte&s;t means to a certain end, no matter what that end may be: This indeed is a proof of knowledge and intelli|gence; but the&s;e alone do not con&s;titute wi&s;dom; the word implies the application of the&s;e fitte&s;t means to the be&s;t and kinde&s;t end: Or, who will call it true wi&s;dom? even among&s;t our&s;elves, it is not held as &s;uch. All the attributes then that he &s;eems to think apparent in the con&s;titution of things, are his unity, infinity, eternity and intelligence; from no one of which, I boldly affirm, can re&s;ult any duty of gratitude or adoration incumbent on mankind, more than if He and all things round him were produced, as &s;ome have dared to think, by the nece&s;|&s;ary working of eternal matter in an infinite vacuum. For what does it avail to add intelligence to tho&s;e other phy&s;ical attributes, unle&s;s that intelligence be directed, not only to the good of the whole, but al&s;o to the good of every individual of which that whole is compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is therefore no impiety, but the direct contrary, to &s;ay that human ju&s;tice and the other virtues, which are indeed only various applications of human benevolence, bear &s;ome re|&s;emblance to the moral attributes of the &s;upreme Being: It is only by means of that re&s;emblance, we conceive them in him, or their effects in his works: It is by the &s;ame means only, that we comprehend tho&s;e phy&s;ical attributes which his Lord&s;hip allows to be demon&s;trable: How can we form any notion of his unity, but from that unity of which we our&s;elves are con|&s;cious? How of his exi&s;tence, but from our own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="267" REF="270">
of exi&s;ting? How of his power, but of that power which we experience in our&s;elves? yet neither Lord Bolingbroke nor any other man, that thought on the&s;e &s;ubjects, ever believed that the&s;e our ideas were real and full repre&s;entations of the&s;e attri|butes in the Divinity. They &s;ay he knows; they do not mean that he compares ideas which he acquired from &s;en&s;ation, and draws conclu&s;ions from them. They &s;ay he acts; they do not mean by impul&s;e, nor as the &s;oul acts on an organized body. They &s;ay he is omnipotent and eternal; yet on what are their ideas founded, but on our own narrow conceptions of &s;pace and duration, prolonged beyond the bounds of &s;pace and time? Either therefore there is a re&s;emblance and analogy (however imperfect and di&s;tant) between the attributes of the Divinity and our conceptions of them, or we cannot have any concep|tions of them at all: He allows we ought to rea&s;on from earth, that we do know, to heaven which we do not know; how can we do &s;o but by that affinity which appears between one and the other?</P>
<P>In vain then does my Lord attempt to ridicule the warm but melancholy imagination of Mr. Wolla&s;ton in that fine &s;oliloquy: <Q REND="inline">"Mu&s;t I then bid my la&s;t farewel to the&s;e walks when I clo&s;e the&s;e lids, and yonder blue regions and all this &s;cene darken upon me and go out? Mu&s;t I then only &s;erve to furni&s;h du&s;t to be mingled with the a&s;hes of the&s;e herds and plants, or with this dirt under my feet? Have I been &s;et &s;o far above them in life, only to be levelled with them in death?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Religion of Nature delineated, &s;ect. 9, p. 209, quarto.</BIBL></NOTE></Q> No thinking head, no heart, that has the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, but mu&s;t

have made the &s;ame reflection; or at lea&s;t mu&s;t feel, not the beauty alone, but the truth of it when he hears it from the mouth of another. Now what reply will Lord Bolingbroke make to the&s;e que&s;tions which are put to him, not only by Wol|la&s;ton, but by all mankind? He will tell you, that we, that is, the animals, vegetables, &s;tones, and <HI>other clods of earth,</HI> are all connected in one immen&s;e de&s;ign, that we are all Dramatis Per|&s;onae, in different characters, and that we were not made for our&s;elves, but for the action: that it is fooli&s;h, pre&s;umptuous, impious, and profane to murmur again&s;t the Almighty Author of this drama, when we feel our&s;elves unavoidably unhappy. On the contrary, we ought to re&s;t our head on the &s;oft pillow of re&s;ignation, on the immovable rock of tranquillity &s;ecure; that if our pains and afflictions grow violent indeed, an immediate end will be put to our mi&s;erable being, and we &s;hall be mingled with the dirt under our feet, a thing common to all the animal kind; and of which, he who complains, does not &s;eem to have been &s;et by his rea&s;on &s;o far above them in life, as to de&s;erve not to be mingled with them in death.

<P>I Am not &s;orry to hear you are exceeding bu&s;y, except as it has deprived me of the plea&s;ure I &s;hould have in hearing often from you; and as it has been occa&s;ioned by a little vexa|tion and di&s;appointment. To find one's &s;elf bu&s;ine&s;s, I am per|&s;uaded, is the great art of life; I am never &s;o angry, as when I hear my acquaintance wi&s;hing they had been bred to &s;ome poking profe&s;&s;ion, or employed in &s;ome office of drudgery, as if it were plea&s;anter to be at the command of other people than at one's own; and as if they could not go unle&s;s they were wound up: yet I know and feel what they mean by this com|plaint; it proves that &s;ome &s;pirit, &s;omething of genius (more than common) is required to teach a man how to employ him|&s;elf: I &s;ay a man; for women, commonly &s;peaking, never feel this di&s;temper, they have always &s;omething to do; time hangs not on their hands (unle&s;s they be fine Ladies); a variety of &s;mall inventions and occupations fill up the void, and their eyes are never open in vain.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, I have again found re&s;t for the &s;ole of my gouty foot in your old dining-room<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hou&s;e in Southampton-Row, where Mr. Gray lodged, had been te|nanted by Dr. Wharton; who, on account of his ill health, left London the year before, and was removed to his paternal e&s;tate at Old Park, near Durham.</NOTE>, and hope that you will find at lea&s;t an equal &s;atisfaction at Old Park; if your bog prove as comfortable as my oven, I &s;hall &s;ee no occa&s;ion to pity you, and only wi&s;h you may brew no wor&s;e than I bake.</P>

You totally mi&s;take my talents, when you impute to me any magical &s;kill in planting ro&s;es: I know I am no conjurer in the&s;e things; when they are done I can find fault, and that is all. Now this is the very rever&s;e of genius, and I feel my own littlene&s;s. Rea&s;onable people know them&s;elves better than is commonly imagined; and therefore (though I never &s;aw any in&s;tance of it) I believe Ma&s;on when he tells me that he un|der&s;tands the&s;e things. The prophetic eye of ta&s;te (as Mr. Pitt called it) &s;ees all the beauties, that a place is &s;u&s;ceptible of, long before they are born; and when it plants a &s;eedling, already &s;its under the &s;hadow of it, and enjoys the effect it will have from every point of view that lies in pro&s;pect. You mu&s;t there|fore invoke Caractacus, and he will &s;end his &s;pirits from the top of Snowdon to Cro&s;s-fell or Warden-law.</P>
<P>I am much obliged to you for your antique news. Froi&s;&s;ard is a favourite book of mine (though I have not attentively read him, but only dipped here and there); and it is &s;trange to me that people, who would give thou&s;ands for a dozen portraits (originals of that time) to furni&s;h a gallery, &s;hould never ca&s;t an eye on &s;o many moving pictures of the life, actions, manners, and thoughts of their ance&s;tors, done on the &s;pot, and in &s;trong, though &s;imple colours. In the &s;ucceeding century Froi&s;&s;ard, I find, was read with great &s;atisfaction by every body that could read; and on the &s;ame footing with King Arthur, Sir Tri&s;tram, and Archbi&s;hop Turpin: not becau&s;e they thought him a fabu|lous writer, but becau&s;e they took them all for true and au|thentic hi&s;torians; to &s;o little purpo&s;e was it in that age for a man to be at the pains of writing truth. Pray, are you come to the four Iri&s;h Kings that went to &s;chool to King Richard

Tri&s;tram Shan|dy is &s;till a greater object of admiration, the man as well as the book; one is invited to dinner, where he dines, a fortnight be|fore: As to the volumes yet publi&s;hed, there is much good fun in them, and humour &s;ometimes hit and &s;ometimes mi&s;&s;ed.

I thank you for communicating to me what mu&s;t give you &s;o much &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I too was reading M.

I could only ta&s;te a little of the fir&s;t cour&s;e: it was dry as a &s;tick, hard as a &s;tone, and cold as a cucumber. But then the Letter to Rou&s;&s;eau is like him&s;elf; and the Di&s;cour&s;es on Elocution, and on the Liberty of Mu&s;ic, are divine. He has added to his tran&s;lations from Tacitus; and (what is remarkable) though that Author's manner more nearly re&s;embles the be&s;t French Writers of the pre&s;ent age, than any thing, he totally fails in the attempt. Is it his fault, or that of the language?</P>
<P>I have received another Scotch packet<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Of the fragments of Er&s;e Poetry, many of which Mr. Gray &s;aw in manu|&s;cript before they were publi&s;hed. In a letter to Dr. Wharton, written in the following month, he thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf on the &s;ame &s;ubject: <Q REND="inline">"If you have &s;een Mr. Stonhewer, he has probably told you of my old Scotch (or rather Iri&s;h Poetry), I am gone mad about them; they are &s;aid to be tran&s;lations (literal and in pro&s;e) from the Er&s;e tongue, done by one Macpher&s;on, a young clergy|man in the Highlands: He means to publi&s;h a collection he has of the&s;e &s;peci|mens of antiquity, if it be antiquity; but what perplexes me is, I cannot come at any certainty on that head. I was &s;o &s;truck with their beauty, that I writ into Scotland to make a thou&s;and enquiries; the letters I have in return, are ill wrote, ill rea&s;oned, un&s;atisfactory, calculated (one would imagine) to deceive, and yet not cunning enough to do it cleverly. In &s;hort, the whole external evidence would make one believe the&s;e fragments counterfeit; but the internal is &s;o &s;trong on the other &s;ide, that I am re&s;olved to believe them ge|nuine, &s;pite of the Devil and the Kirk: it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive that they were written by the &s;ame man that writes me the&s;e letters; on the other hand, it is almo&s;t as hard to &s;uppo&s;e (if they are original) that he &s;hould be able to tran&s;|late them &s;o admirably. In &s;hort, this man is the very daemon of poetry, or he has lighted on a trea&s;ure hid for ages. The Welch Poets are al&s;o coming to light; I have &s;een a di&s;cour&s;e in manu&s;cript about them, by one Mr. Evans, a clergyman, with &s;pecimens of their writing, this is in Latin; and though it does not approach the other, there are fine &s;craps among it."</Q></NOTE> with a third &s;peci|men, inferior in kind, (becau&s;e it is merely de&s;cription) but yet

full of nature and noble wild imagination. Five Bards pa&s;s the night at the Ca&s;tle of a Chief (him&s;elf a principal Bard); each goes out in his turn to ob&s;erve the face of things, and returns with an extempore picture of the changes he has &s;een (it is an October night, the harve&s;t-month of the Highlands). This is the whole plan; yet there is a contrivance, and a preparation of ideas, that you would not expect. The odde&s;t thing is, that every one of them &s;ees Gho&s;ts (more or le&s;s). The idea, that &s;truck and &s;urpri&s;ed me mo&s;t, is the following. One of them (de&s;cribing a &s;torm of wind and rain) &s;ays<Q><L>Gho&s;ts ride on the tempe&s;t to-night:</L>

Did you never ob&s;erve <HI>(while rocking winds are piping loud)</HI> that pau&s;e, as the gu&s;t is recollecting it&s;elf, and ri&s;ing upon the ear in a &s;hrill and plaintive note, like the &s;well of an Aeolian harp? I do a&s;&s;ure you there is nothing in the world &s;o like the voice of a &s;pirit.

us the favorite Minions of Ta&s;te and of Fa&s;hion, e&s;pecially as to Odes. For to them his ridicule is confined; &s;o it is not him, but Mr. Colman, nephew to Lady Bath, author of the Con|noi&s;&s;eur, a member of one of the inns of court, and a parti|cular acquaintance of Mr. Garrick. What have you done to him? for I never heard his name before; he makes very to|lerable fun with me where I under&s;tand him (which is not every where); but &s;eems more angry with you. Le&s;t people &s;hould not under&s;tand the humour of the thing (which indeed to do they mu&s;t have our Lyrici&s;ms at their finger ends) letters come out in Lloyd's Evening-Po&s;t to tell them who and what it was that he meant, and &s;ays it is like to produce a great combu&s;tion in the Literary World.

It is for the &s;ake of &s;hewing how Mr. Gray felt on &s;uch occa&s;ions, that I publi&s;h this letter.</NOTE>. The Monthly Review, I &s;ee, ju&s;t now has much &s;tuff about us on this occa&s;ion.

To whatever &s;ide of the que&s;tion truth may lean, it is of little moment to me; my doubts ari&s;ing (as I have &s;aid in the former note) from internal evidence only, and a want of proof of the fidelity of the tran&s;lation.</NOTE>. There is a country Surgeon in Lochaber, who has by heart the entire Epic Poem men|tioned by Mr. Macpher&s;on in his preface; and, as he is old, is perhaps the only per&s;on living that knows it all, and has never committed it to writing, we are in the more ha&s;te to recover a monument, which will certainly be regarded as a curio&s;ity in the Republic of Letters: we have therefore &s;et about a &s;ub&s;cription of a guinea or two guineas a piece, in order to enable Mr. Macpher&s;on to undertake a mi&s;&s;ion into the Highlands to recover this poem, and other fragments of antiquity."</Q> He adds too, that the names of Fingal, O&s;&s;ian, O&s;car, &amp;c. are &s;till given in the Highlands to large Ma&s;tiffs, as we give to ours the names of Cae&s;ar, Pompey, Hector, &amp;c.</P>

Happy they that can create a ro&s;e-tree, or erect a honey-&s;uckle; that can watch the brood of a hen, or &s;ee a fleet of their own ducklings launch into the water: It is with a &s;entiment of envy I &s;peak it, who never &s;hall have even a thatched roof of my own, nor gather a &s;traw|berry but in Covent-Garden.

We have heard nothing, &s;ince I remember Operas, but eternal pa&s;&s;ages, divi&s;ions, and flights of execution: of the&s;e he has ab&s;olutely none; whether merely from judgment, or a little from age, I will not affirm; his point is expre&s;&s;ion, and to that all the graces and ornaments he in&s;erts (which are few and &s;hort) are evidently directed: He goes higher (they &s;ay) than Farinelli; but then this cele&s;tial note you do not hear above once in a whole Opera; and he falls from this altitude at once to the mellowe&s;t, &s;ofte&s;t, &s;tronge&s;t tones (about the middle of his compa&s;s) that can be heard. The Mattei, I a&s;&s;ure you, is much improved by his example, and by her great &s;ucce&s;s this winter; but then the Burlettas, and the Paganina, I have not been &s;o plea&s;ed with any thing the&s;e many years: She too is fat, and above forty, yet hand&s;ome withal, and has a face that &s;peaks the language of all nations: She has not the invention, the fire, and the variety of action that the Spiletta had; yet &s;he is light, agile, ever in motion, and above all graceful; but then her voice, her ear, her ta&s;te in &s;inging: Good God&mdash;as Mr. Richard&s;on the painter &s;ays.

<P>I am obliged to you for your Drawing and very <HI>learned</HI> di&s;|&s;ertation annexed<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This relates to the ruin of a &s;mall Gothic chapel near the north-we&s;t end of the cathedral at York, not noticed by Drake in his Eboracum. When Mr. Gray made me a vi&s;it at that place the &s;ummer before, he was much &s;truck with the beautiful proportion of the windows in it, which induced me to get Mr. Paul Sandby to make a drawing of it; and al&s;o to endeavour, in a Letter to Mr. Gray, to explain to what foundation it belonged. As his an&s;wer contains &s;ome excellent general remarks on Gothic building, I thought proper to publi&s;h it, tho' the particular matter which occa&s;ioned them was not of any great con&s;equence.</NOTE>. You have made out your point with a
<PB N="295" REF="298">
great degree of probability, (for tho' the <HI>nimis adhoe&s;it</HI> might &s;tartle one, yet the &s;ale of the tithes and chapel to Web&s;ter &s;eems to &s;et all right again) and I do believe the building in que&s;tion was the chapel of St. Sepulchre. But then, that the ruin now &s;tanding was the individual chapel as erected by Archbi&s;hop Roger, I can by no means think: I found my&s;elf merely on the &s;tyle and ta&s;te of architecture. The vaults under the choir are &s;till in being, and were undoubtedly built by this very Arch|bi&s;hop: they are truly Saxon; only that the arches are pointed, though very obtu&s;ely. It is the &s;outh tran&s;ept (not the north) that is the olde&s;t part of the min&s;ter now above ground: it is &s;aid to have been begun by Geffrey Plantagenet, who died about thirty years after Roger, and left it unfini&s;hed. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Walter Grey, compleated it; &s;o we do not exactly know to which of the&s;e two prelates we are to a&s;cribe any certain part of it. Grey lived a long time, and was Archbi&s;hop from 1216 to 1255 (39 Henry III.); and in this reign it was, that the beauty of the Gothic architecture began to appear. The chap|ter-hou&s;e is in all probability his work, and (I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e) built in his latter days; whereas what he did of the &s;outh tran|&s;ept might be performed &s;oon after his acce&s;&s;ion. It is in the &s;econd order of this building, that the round arches appear in|cluding a row of pointed ones, (which you mention, and which I al&s;o ob&s;erved) &s;imilar to tho&s;e in St. Sepulchre's chapel, tho' far inferior in the proportions and neatne&s;s of workman&s;hip. The &s;ame thing is repeated in the north tran&s;ept; but this is only an imitation of the other, done for the &s;ake of regularity; for this part of the building is no older than Archbi&s;hop Ro|maine, who came to the &s;ee in 1285, and died 1295.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="299">
All the buildings of Henry the Second's time (under whom Roger lived and died, 1185) are of a clum&s;y and heavy pro|portion, with a few rude and aukward ornaments; and this &s;tyle continues to the beginning of Henry the Third's reign, though with a little improvement, as in the nave of Fountain's abbey, &amp;c. then all at once come in the tall picked arches, the light clu&s;tered columns, the capitals of curling foliage, the fretted tabernacles and vaultings, and a profu&s;ion of &s;tatues, &amp;c. that con&s;titute the good Gothic &s;tyle; together with decrea&s;ing and flying buttre&s;&s;es, and pinnacles, on the out&s;ide. Nor mu&s;t you conclude any thing from Roger's own tomb, which has (I remember) a wide &s;urba&s;ed arch with &s;calloped ornaments, &amp;c. for this can be no older than the nave it&s;elf, which was built by Archbi&s;hop Melton after the year 1315, one hundred and thirty years after Roger's death.</P>
<P>I have compared Helvetius and Elfrida, as you de&s;ired me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the plagiari&s;m, to which Mr. Gray here alludes, is but little known, and, I think, for its &s;ingularity, is &s;omewhat curious, I &s;hall beg the reader's patience while I dilate upon it; tho' I am aware it will &s;tretch this note to an uncon&s;cion|able length. M. Helvetius, in the third chapter of his third E&s;&s;ay de l'E&s;prit, which treats of the Extent of Memory, means to prove that this faculty, in the extreme, is not nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a great Genius. For this purpo&s;e he examines whe|ther the greatne&s;s of the very different talents of Locke and of Milton ought to be con&s;idered as the effect of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this talent in an extraordinary degree. He then proceeds as follows: <Q REND="inline">"As the la&s;t example of the &s;mall extent of memory ne|ce&s;&s;ary to a fine imagination, I &s;hall give in a note <HI>the tran&s;lation of a piece of Engli&s;h poetry;</HI> which, with the preceding, will, I believe, prove to tho&s;e who would decompo&s;e the works of illu&s;trious men, that a great genius does not nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e a great memory."</Q> I now &s;et down that note with references to Elfrida underneath it, and I chu&s;e to give it in the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation printed in 1759, that the parallel pa&s;&s;ages may be the more obvious at fir&s;t &s;ight. <Q REND="inline">"A young Virgin, awaked and guided by Love, goes before the appearance of Aurora to a valley, where &s;he waits for the coming of her Lover, who, at the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, is to offer a &s;acrifice to the Gods. Her &s;oul, in the &s;oft &s;ituation in which &s;he is placed by the hopes of approaching happine&s;s, indulges, while waiting for him, the plea&s;ure of contemplating the beauties of Nature, and the ri&s;ing of that luminary that was to bring the object of her tenderne&s;s."</Q> She expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf thus:

Cruel as they are, they have placed in the rank of the virtues the barbarous fury of revenge, and the mad love of their country; but never have they reckoned fidelity among the virtues. Without remor&s;e they abu&s;e innocence, and often their vanity contemplates our griefs with delight. But no; fly far from me, ye odious thoughts, my Lover will come! A thou&s;and times have I experienced it: <HI>As &s;oon as I perceive him my agitated mind is calm, and I often forget the too ju&s;t cau&s;e I have for complaint; for near him I can only know happine&s;s</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&mdash;My truant heart</L>

Here ends this odd in&s;tance of plagiari&s;m. When M. Helvetius was in Eng|land, a year or two after I had made the di&s;covery of it, I took my mea&s;ures (as Mr. Gray advi&s;ed me) to learn how he came by it; and accordingly reque&s;ted two Noblemen, to whom he was introduced, to a&s;k him &s;ome que&s;tions concern|ing it; but I could gain no &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. I do not, however, by any means, &s;uppo&s;e that the per&s;on who cooked up the disjointed parts of my Drama into this &s;trange Frica&s;ee, was M. Helvetius him&s;elf; I rather imagine (as I did from the fir&s;t) that he was impo&s;ed upon by &s;ome young Engli&s;h traveller, who contrived this expedient in order to pa&s;s with him for a Poet. The great Philo|&s;opher, it is true, has in this note been proved to be <HI>the receiver of Stolen Goods;</HI> but out of re&s;pect to his numerous fa&s;hionable di&s;ciples, both abroad and at home, who&s;e credit might &s;uffer with that of their Ma&s;ter, I acquit him of what would only be held criminal at the Old Bailey, that he received the&s;e goods <HI>knowing them to be &s;tolen.</HI></NOTE>."</Q></NOTE>, and find thirteen parallel pa&s;&s;ages; five of which, at lea&s;t, are

<P>YOU will make my be&s;t acknowledgments to Mr. Howe; who, not content to rank me in the number of his friends, is &s;o polite as to make excu&s;es for having done me that honour.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="304">
I was not born &s;o far from the &s;un, as to be ignorant of Count Algarotti's name and reputation; nor am I &s;o far advanced in years, or in philo&s;ophy, as not to feel the warmth of his ap|probation. The Odes in que&s;tion, as their motto &s;hews, were meant to be <HI>vocal to the intelligent alone.</HI> How few they were in my own country, Mr. Howe can te&s;tify; and yet my ambi|tion was terminated by that &s;mall circle.

<P>I am equally plea&s;ed with the ju&s;t applau&s;e he be&s;tows on Mr. Ma&s;on; and particularly on his Caractacus, which is the work of a Man: whereas Elfrida is only that of a Boy, a pro|mi&s;ing boy indeed, and of no common genius: yet this is the popular performance, and the other little known in compa|ri&s;on.</P>
<P>Neither Count Algarotti nor Mr. Howe (I believe) have heard of O&s;&s;ian, the Son of Fingal. If Mr. Howe were not upon the wing, and on his way homewards, I would &s;end it to him in Italy. He would there &s;ee that Imagination dwelt many hundred years ago, in all her pomp, on the cold and barren mountains of Scotland. The truth (I believe) is, that, without any re&s;pect of climates, &s;he reigns in all na&s;cent &s;ocie|ties of men, where the nece&s;&s;ities of life force every one to think and act much for him&s;elf.</P>

<P>YOU may well wonder at my long taciturnity. I wonder too, and know not what cau&s;e to a&s;&s;ign; for it is certain I think of you daily. I believe it is owing to the nothingne&s;s of my hi&s;tory; for except &s;ix weeks that I pa&s;&s;ed in Town towards the end of the &s;pring, and a little jaunt to Ep&s;om and Box-hill, I have been here time out of mind, in a place where no events grow, tho' we pre&s;erve tho&s;e of former days, by way of <HI>Hortus &s;iccus</HI> in our libraries.</P>
<P>I doubt you have not yet read Rou&s;&s;eau's Emile. Every body that has children &s;hould read it more than once: for tho' it abounds with his u&s;ual glorious ab&s;urdity, tho' his general &s;cheme of education be an impracticable chimera, yet there are a thou&s;and lights &s;truck out, a thou&s;and important truths bet|ter expre&s;&s;ed than ever they were before, that may be of &s;er|vice to the wi&s;e&s;t men. Particularly I think he has ob&s;erved children with more attention, and knows their meaning and the working of their little pa&s;&s;ions better than any other writer. As to his religious di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, which have alarmed the world, and engaged their thoughts more than any other part of his book, I &s;et them all at nought, and wi&s;h they had been omit|ted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That I may put together the re&s;t of Mr. Gray's &s;entiments concerning this &s;ingular writer, I in&s;ert here an extract from a Letter of later date, written to my|&s;elf. <Q REND="inline">"I have not read the Philo&s;ophic Dictionary.

It is a weak attempt to &s;eparate the miracles from the morality of the go&s;pel. The latter (he would have you think) he believes was &s;ent from God; and the former he very explicitly takes for an impo&s;ture: this is in order to prove the cruelty and inju&s;tice of the State of Geneva in burning his Emile. The latter part of his book is to &s;hew the abu&s;es that have crept into the con&s;titution of his country, which point (if you are concerned about it) he makes out very well; and his intention in this is plainly to rai&s;e a tumult in the city, and to be revenged on the <HI>Petit Con&s;eil,</HI> who condemned his writings to the flames."</Q></NOTE>.</P>

<P>MY in&s;tructions, of which you are &s;o de&s;irous, are two|fold: the fir&s;t part relates to what is pa&s;t, and that will be rather diffu&s;e: the &s;econd, to what is to come; and that we &s;hall treat more &s;uccinctly, and with all due brevity.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, when you come to Paris you will not fail to vi&s;it the cloi&s;ter of the Chartreu&s;e, where Le Sueur (in the hi&s;tory of St. Bruno) has almo&s;t equalled Raphael. Then your Gothic inclinations will naturally lead you to the Sainte Chapelle built by St. Louis: in the trea&s;ury is pre&s;erved one of the noble&s;t gems of the Augu&s;tan age. When you take a trip into the country, there is a fine old chapel at Vincennes with
<PB N="305" REF="308">
admirable painted windows; and at Fontainbleau, the remains of Francis the Fir&s;t's magnificence might give you &s;ome plea|&s;ure. In your way to Lyons you will take notice of the view over the Saone, from about Tournus and Macon. Fail not to walk a few miles along the banks of the Rhone, down the river. I would certainly make a little journey to the Grande Chartreu&s;e, up the mountains: at your return out of Italy this will have little effect. At Turin you will vi&s;it the Capuchins' convent ju&s;t without the city, and the Superga at no great di&s;tance, for the &s;ake of the views. At Genoa ob&s;erve the Terreno of the Palace Brignoli, as a model of an apartment elegantly di&s;po&s;ed in a hot climate. At Parma you will adore the great Madonna and St. Jerom, once at St. Antonio Abbate, but now (I am told) in the Ducal Palace. In the Madonna della Steccata ob&s;erve the Mo&s;es breaking the tables, a chiaro|&s;curo figure of the Parmeggiano at too great a height, and ill lighted, but immen&s;e. At the Capuchins, the great Piet&aacute; of Annib. Caracci; in the Villa Ducale, the room painted by Carlo Cignani; and the la&s;t works of Ago&s;tino Caracci at Mo|dena<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When our Author was him&s;elf in Italy, he &s;tudied with much attention the different manners of the old ma&s;ters.

I fear I cannot (as I would wi&s;h) do my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of waiting on you at Aberdeen, being under an engagement to go to-morrow to Taymouth, and, if the weather will allow it, to the Blair of Athol: this will take up four or five days, and at my return the approach of winter will &s;carce permit me to think of any farther expeditions northwards. My &s;tay here will, however, be a fortnight or three weeks longer; and if in that time any bu&s;ine&s;s or invitation &s;hould call you this way, Lord Strathmore gives me commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ay, he &s;hall be ex|tremely glad to &s;ee you at Glames; and doubt not it will be a particular &s;atisfaction to me to receive and thank you in per&s;on for the favourable &s;entiments you have entertained of me, and the civilities with which you have honoured me.</P>

<P>I Deferred writing to you till I had &s;een a little more of this country than you your&s;elf had &s;een; and now being ju&s;t re|turned from an excur&s;ion, which I and Major Lyon have been making, into the Highlands, I &s;it down to give you an account of it. But fir&s;t I mu&s;t return to my journey hither, on which I &s;hall be very &s;hort; partly becau&s;e you know the way as far as Edinburgh, and partly that there was not a great deal worth re|marking. The fir&s;t night we pa&s;&s;ed at Tweedmouth (77 miles); the next at Edinburgh (53 miles); where Lord Strathmore left the Major and me, to go to Lenox-Love, (Lord Blantyre's)
<PB N="310" REF="313">
where his Aunt lives: &s;o that afternoon and all next day I had lei&s;ure to vi&s;it the Ca&s;tle, Holyrood-Hou&s;e, Heriot's Ho&s;pital, Arthur's &s;eat, &amp;c. and am not &s;orry to have &s;een that mo&s;t pic|ture&s;que (at a di&s;tance), and na&s;tie&s;t (when near) of all capital cities. I &s;upped with Dr. Robert&s;on and other literati, and the next morning Lord Strathmore came for us. We cro&s;&s;ed at the Queen's Ferry in a four-oared yawl without a &s;ail, and were to&s;&s;ed about rather more than I &s;hould wi&s;h to hazard again; lay at Perth, a large Scotch town with much wood about it, on the banks of the Tay, a very noble river. Next morning ferried over it, and came by dinner-time to Glames; being (from Edin|burgh) 67 miles, which makes in all (from Hetton) 197 miles. The ca&s;tle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is &s;aid to be the very Ca&s;tle in which Duncan was murdered by Mac|beth.</NOTE> &s;tands in Strathmore (i. e. the Great Valley) which winds about from Stonehaven on the ea&s;t coa&s;t of Kincardine|&s;hire, obliquely, as far as Stirling, near 100 miles in length, and from &s;even to ten miles in breadth, cultivated every where to the foot of the hills, on either hand, with oats or bere, a &s;pecies of barley, except where the &s;oil is mere peat-earth, (black as a coal) or barren &s;and covered only with broom and heath, or a &s;hort gra&s;s fit for &s;heep. Here and there appear, ju&s;t above ground, the huts of the inhabitants, which they call Towns, built of, and covered with, turf; and among them, at great di&s;tances, the gentlemen's hou&s;es, with inclo&s;ures and a few trees round them.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e the Ca&s;tle of Glames di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf, the middle part of it ri&s;ing proudly out of what &s;eems a great and thick wood of tall trees, with a clu&s;ter of hanging towers on the
<PB N="311" REF="314">
top. You de&s;cend to it gradually from the &s;outh, through a double and triple avenue of Scotch firs 60 or 70 feet high, under three gateways. This approach is a full mile long; and when you have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;econd gate, the firs change to limes, and an|other oblique avenue goes off on either hand towards the offices. The&s;e, as well as all the inclo&s;ures that &s;urround the hou&s;e, are bordered with three or four ranks of &s;ycamores, a&s;hes, and white poplars of the noble&s;t height, and from 70 to 100 years old. Other alleys there are, that go off at right angles with the long one; &s;mall groves, and walled gardens, of Earl Patrick's plant|ing, full of broad-leaved elms, oaks, birch, black cherry-trees, laburnums, &amp;c. all of great &s;tature and &s;ize, which have not till this week begun to &s;hew the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of morning fro&s;ts. The third gate delivers you into a court with a broad pavement, and gra&s;s-plats adorned with &s;tatues of the four Stuart Kings, bordered with old &s;ilver firs and yew-trees, alternately, and opening with an iron pali&s;ade on either &s;ide to two &s;quare old|fa&s;hioned parterres &s;urrounded by &s;tone fruit-walls. The hou&s;e, from the height of it, the greatne&s;s of its ma&s;s, the many towers atop, and the &s;pread of its wings, has really a very &s;in|gular and &s;triking appearance, like nothing I ever &s;aw. You will comprehend &s;omething of its &s;hape from the plan of the &s;econd floor, which I inclo&s;e. The wings are about 50 feet high; the body (which is the old ca&s;tle, with walls 10 feet thick) is near 100. From the leads I &s;ee to the &s;outh of me (ju&s;t at the end of the avenue) the little town of Glames, the hou&s;es built of &s;tone, and &s;lated, with a neat kirk and &s;mall &s;quare tower (a rarity in this region). Ju&s;t beyond it ri&s;es a beautiful round hill, and another ridge of a longer form adja|cent to it, both covered with woods of tall fir. Beyond them,
<PB N="312" REF="315">
peep over the black hills of Sid-law, over which winds the road to Dundee. To the north, within about &s;even miles of me, begin to ri&s;e the Grampians, hill above hill, on who&s;e tops three weeks ago I could plainly &s;ee &s;ome traces of the &s;now that fell in May la&s;t. To the ea&s;t, winds a way to the Strath, &s;uch as I have before de&s;cribed it, among the hills, which &s;ink lower and lower as they approach the &s;ea. To the we&s;t, the &s;ame valley (not plain, but broken, unequal ground) runs on for above 20 miles in view: there I &s;ee the crags above Dunkeld; there Beni-Gloe and Beni-More ri&s;e above the clouds; and there is that She-khallian, that &s;pires into a cone above them all, and lies at lea&s;t 45 miles (in a direct line) from this place.</P>
<P>Lord Strathmore, who is the greate&s;t farmer in this neigh|bourhood, is from break of day to dark night among his hu&s;|bandmen and labourers: he has near 2000 acres of land in his own hands, and is at pre&s;ent employed in building a low wall of four miles long, and in widening the bed of the little river Deane, which runs to &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t of the hou&s;e, from about twenty to fifty feet wide, both to prevent inundations, and to drain the lake of Forfar. This work will be two years more in compleating, and mu&s;t be three miles in length. All the Highlanders that can be got are employed in it; many of them know no Engli&s;h, and I hear them &s;inging Er&s;e &s;ongs all day long. The price of labour is eight pence a day; but to &s;uch as will join together, and engage to perform a certain por|tion in a limited time, two &s;hillings.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;ay that all his labours &s;eem to pro&s;per; and my Lord has ca&s;ually found in digging &s;uch quantities of &s;hell|marl,
<PB N="313" REF="316">
as not only fertilize his own grounds, but are di&s;po&s;ed of at a good price to all his neighbours. In his nur&s;eries are thou&s;ands of oaks, beech, larches, hor&s;e-che&s;nuts, &s;pruce-firs, &amp;c. thick as they can &s;tand, and who&s;e only fault is, that they are grown tall and vigorous before he has determined where to plant them out; the mo&s;t advantageous &s;pot we have for beauty lies we&s;t of the hou&s;e, where (when the &s;tone-walls of the meadows are taken away) the grounds, naturally unequal, will have a very park-like appearance: they are already full of trees, which need only thinning here and there to break the regularity of their trout-&s;tream which joins the river Deane hard by. Pur&s;uing the cour&s;e of this brook upwards, you come to a narrow &s;eque&s;tered valley &s;heltered from all winds, thro' which it runs murmuring among great &s;tones; on one hand the ground gently ri&s;es into a hill, on the other are the rocky banks of the rivulet almo&s;t perpendicular, yet covered with &s;ycamore, a&s;h, and fir, that (though it &s;eems to have no place or &s;oil to grow in) yet has ri&s;en to a good height, and forms a thick &s;hade: you may continue along this gill, and pa&s;&s;ing by one end of the village and its church for half a mile, it leads to an opening between the two hills covered with fir-woods, that I mentioned above, through which the &s;tream makes its way, and forms a ca&s;cade of ten or twelve feet over broken rocks. A very little art is nece&s;&s;ary to make all this a beautiful &s;cene. The weather, till the la&s;t week, has been in general very fine and warm; we have had no fires till now, and often have &s;at with the windows open an hour after &s;un-&s;et: now and then a &s;hower has come, and &s;ometimes &s;udden gu&s;ts of wind de&s;cend from the moun|tains, that fini&s;h as &s;uddenly as they aro&s;e; but to-day it blows a hurricane. Upon the whole, I have been exceeding lucky in
<PB N="314" REF="317">
my weather, and particularly in my Highland expedition of five days.</P>
<P>We &s;et out then the 11th of September, and continuing along the Strath to the we&s;t, pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Megill,</HI> (where is the tomb of <HI>Queen Wanders, that was riven to dethe by &s;taned hor&s;es for nae gade that &s;he did;</HI> &s;o the women there told me, I a&s;&s;ure you) thro' Cowper of Angus: over the river Ila; then over a wide and di&s;mal heath, fit for an a&s;&s;embly of witches, till we came to a &s;tring of four &s;mall lakes in a valley, who&s;e deep blue waters and green margin, with a gentleman's hou&s;e or two &s;eated on them in little groves, contra&s;ted with the black de&s;ert in which they were incha&s;ed. The ground now grew unequal; the hills, more rocky, &s;eemed to clo&s;e in upon us, till the road came to the brow of a &s;teep de&s;cent, and (the &s;un then &s;etting) between two woods of oak we &s;aw far below us the river Tay come &s;weeping along at the bottom of a precipice, at lea&s;t 150 feet deep, clear as gla&s;s, full to the brim, and very rapid in its cour&s;e; it &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue out of woods thick and tall, that ro&s;e on either hand, and were over-hung by broken rocky crags of va&s;t height; above them, to the we&s;t, the tops of higher mountains appeared, on which the evening clouds re|po&s;ed. Down by the &s;ide of the river, under the thicke&s;t &s;hades, is &s;eated the town of Dunkeld; in the mid&s;t of it &s;tands a ruined cathedral, the towers and &s;hell of the building &s;till en|tire: a little beyond it, a large hou&s;e of the Duke of Athol, with its offices and gardens, extends a mile beyond the town; and as his grounds were interrupted by the &s;treets and roads, he has flung arches of communication acro&s;s them, that add to the &s;cenery of the place, which of it&s;elf is built of good white
<PB N="315" REF="318">
&s;tone, and hand&s;omely &s;lated; &s;o that no one would take it for a Scotch town till they come into it. Here we pa&s;&s;ed the night; if I told you how, you would ble&s;s your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Next day we &s;et forward to Taymouth, 27 miles farther we&s;t; the road winding through beautiful woods, with the Tay almo&s;t always in full view to the right, being here from 3 to 400 feet over. The Strath-Tay, from a mile to three miles or more wide, covered with corn, and &s;potted with groups of people, then in the mid&s;t of their harve&s;t; on either hand a va&s;t chain of rocky mountains that changed their face and opened &s;omething new every hundred yards, as the way turned, or the clouds pa&s;&s;ed: in &s;hort, altogether it was one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing days I have pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e many years, and at every &s;tep I wi&s;hed for you. At the clo&s;e of day we came to <HI>Balloch</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pennant, in his tour in Scotland, explains this word <Q REND="inline">"the Mouth of the Loch."</Q></NOTE>, &s;o the place was called; but now <HI>Taymouth,</HI> improperly enough; for here it is that the river i&s;&s;ues out of Loch-Tay, a glorious lake 15 miles long and one mile and a half broad, &s;urrounded with prodigious mountains; there on its north-ea&s;tern brink, impending over it, is the va&s;t hill of Lawers; to the ea&s;t is that enormous creature, <HI>She-khallian</HI> (i. e. the maiden's pap) &s;piring above the clouds: directly we&s;t, beyond the end of the lake, <HI>Beni-More,</HI> the great mountain ri&s;es to a mo&s;t awful height, and looks down on the tomb of Fingal. Lord Breadalbane's <HI>policy</HI> (&s;o they call here all &s;uch ground as is laid out for plea&s;ure) takes in about 2000 acres, of which his hou&s;e, offices, and a deer-park, about three miles round, occupy the plain or bottom, which is little above a mile in
<PB N="316" REF="319">
breadth; through it winds the Tay, which, by means of a bridge, I found here to be 156 feet over: his plantations and woods ri&s;e with the ground, on either &s;ide the vale, to the very &s;ummit of the enormous crags that over-hang it: along them, on the mountain's &s;ide, runs a terra&s;s a mile and a half long, that overlooks the cour&s;e of the river. From &s;everal &s;eats and temples perched on particular rocky eminences, you command the lake for many miles in length, which turns like &s;ome huge river, and lo&s;es it&s;elf among the mountains that &s;urround it; at its ea&s;tern extremity, where the river i&s;&s;ues out of it, on a penin&s;ula my Lord has built a neat little town and church with a high &s;quare tower; and ju&s;t before it lies a &s;mall round i&s;land in the lake, covered with trees, among&s;t which are the ruins of &s;ome little religious hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Trees, by the way, grow here to great &s;ize and beauty. I &s;aw four old che&s;nuts in the road, as you enter the park, of va&s;t bulk and height; one beach tree I mea&s;ured that was 16 feet 7 inches in the girth, and, I gue&s;s, near 80 feet in height. The gardener pre&s;ented us with peaches, nectarines, and plums from the &s;tone-walls of the kitchen-garden (for there are no brick nor hot walls); the peaches were good, the re&s;t well ta&s;ted, but &s;carce ripe; we had al&s;o golden pippins from an e&s;palier, not ripe, and a melon very well flavoured and fit to cut: of the hou&s;e I have little to &s;ay; it is a very good nobleman's hou&s;e, hand&s;omely furni&s;hed and well kept, very comfortable to inhabit, but not worth going far to &s;ee. Of the Earl's ta&s;te I have not much more to &s;ay; it is one of tho&s;e noble &s;ituations that Man cannot &s;poil: it is however certain, that he has built an inn and a town ju&s;t where his principal walks &s;hould
<PB N="317" REF="320">
have been, and in the mo&s;t wonderful &s;pot of ground that per|haps belongs to him. In this inn however we lay; and next day returning down the river four miles, we pa&s;&s;ed it over a fine bridge, built at the expence of the government, and continued our way to <HI>Logie-Rait,</HI> ju&s;t below which, in a mo&s;t charming &s;cene, the <HI>Tummel,</HI> which is here the larger river of the two, falls into the Tay. We ferried over the Tummel in order to get into Mar&s;hal Wade's road, which leads from Dunkeld to Inverne&s;s, and continued our way along it toward the north: the road is excellent, but dangerous enough in con&s;cience; the river often running directly under us at the bottom of a preci|pice 200 feet deep, &s;ometimes ma&s;ked indeed by wood that finds means to grow where I could not &s;tand, but very often quite naked and without any defence; in &s;uch places we walked for miles together, partly for fear, and partly to admire the beauty of the country, which the beauty of the weather &s;et off to the greate&s;t advantage: as evening came on, we approached the pa&s;s of Gillikrankie, where, in the year 1745, the He&s;&s;ians, with their prince at their head, &s;topped &s;hort, and refu&s;ed to march a foot farther.</P>

<P>I Am amazed at my&s;elf when I think I have never wrote to you; to be &s;ure it is the &s;in of witchcraft, or &s;omething wor&s;e. Had I been married, like Ma&s;on, &s;ome excu&s;e might be made for it; who (for the fir&s;t time &s;ince that great event) has ju&s;t thought fit to tell me that he never pa&s;&s;ed &s;o happy a winter as the la&s;t, and this in &s;pite of his anxieties, which he &s;ays might even make a part of his happine&s;s; for his wife is by no means in health, &s;he has a con&s;tant cough: yet he is a&s;&s;ured her lungs are not affected, and that it is nothing of the con&s;umptive kind. As to, me I have been neither happy nor mi&s;erable; but in a gentle &s;tupefaction of mind, and very tolerable health of body hitherto. If they la&s;t, I &s;hall not much complain. The accounts one has lately had from all parts, make me &s;uppo&s;e you buried in the &s;now like the old Queen of Denmark. As

<P>Every thing is politics. There are no literary productions worth your notice, at lea&s;t of our country. The French have fini&s;hed their great Encyclopedia in 17 volumes; but there are many flim&s;y articles very ha&s;tily treated, and great incorrectne&s;s of the pre&s;s. There are now 13 volumes of Buffon's Natural Hi&s;tory; and he is not come to the monkies yet, who are a nu|merous people. The Life of Petrarch has entertained me; it is not well written, but very curious, and laid together from his own letters, and the original writings of the fourteenth cen|tury: &s;o that he takes in much of the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e ob&s;cure times, and the characters of many remarkable per&s;ons. There are two volumes quarto; and another, unpubli&s;hed yet, will compleat it.</P>
<P>Mr. Walpole writes me now and then a long and lively letter from Paris; to which place he went la&s;t year with the gout upon him, &s;ometimes in his limbs, often in his &s;tomach and head. He has got &s;omehow well, (not by means of the climate, one would think) goes to all public places, &s;ees all the be&s;t company, and is very much in fa&s;hion.

I &s;aw the Lady you enquire after, when I was la&s;t in London, and a prodigious fine one &s;he is. She had a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion of rouge on her cheeks, a cage of foreign birds and a piping bullfinch at her elbow; two little dogs on a cu&s;hion in her lap, and a cockatoo on her &s;houlder: they were all exceeding glad to &s;ee me, and I them.</P>

<P>In &s;pite of the rain, which I think continued, with very &s;hort intervals, till the beginning of this month, and quite effaced the &s;ummer from the year, I made a &s;hift to pa&s;s May and June not di&s;agreeably in Kent. I was &s;urprized at the beauty of the road to Canterbury, which (I know not why) had not &s;truck me before. The whole country is a rich and well-cultivated garden; orchards, cherry-grounds, hop-gardens, intermixed with corn and frequent villages; gentle ri&s;ings covered with wood, and every where the Thames and Medway breaking in upon the land&s;cape with all their navigation. It was indeed owing to the bad weather that the whole &s;cene was dre&s;&s;ed in that tender emerald green, which one u&s;ually &s;ees only for a fortnight in the opening of the &s;pring; and this continued till I

left the country. My re&s;idence was eight miles ea&s;t of Canter|bury, in a little quiet valley on the &s;kirts of Barham-Down.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Denton, where his friend the Rev. William Robin&s;on, brother to Matthew Robin&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> late member for Canterbury, then re&s;ided.</NOTE> In the&s;e parts the whole &s;oil is chalk, and whenever it holds up, in half an hour it is dry enough to walk out. I took the opportunity of three or four days fine weather to go into the I&s;le of Thanet; &s;aw Margate, (which is Bartholomew fair by the &s;ea &s;ide) Ram&s;gate, and other places there; and &s;o came by Sandwich, Deal, Dover, Folk&s;tone, and Hithe, back again. The coa&s;t is not like Hartlepool; there are no rocks, but only chalky cliffs of no great height till you come to Dover; there indeed they are noble and picture&s;que, and the oppo&s;ite coa&s;ts of France begin to bound your view, which was left before to range unlimited by any thing but the horizon; yet it is by no means a <HI>&s;hiple&s;s</HI> &s;ea, but every where peopled with white &s;ails, and ve&s;&s;els of all &s;izes in motion: and take notice, (except in the I&s;le, which is all corn-fields, and has very little inclo&s;ure) there are in all places hedge-rows, and tall trees even within a few yards of the beach. Particularly, Hithe &s;tands on an emi|nence covered with wood. I &s;hall confe&s;s we had fires at night (ay, and at day too) &s;everal times in June; but do not go and take advantage in the north at this, for it was the mo&s;t unto|ward year that ever I remember.</P>
<P>Have you read the New Bath Guide? It is the only thing in fa&s;hion, and is a new and original kind of humour.

<P>I Received from Mr. William&s;on that very obliging mark you were plea&s;ed to give me of your remembrance: Had I not entertained &s;ome flight hopes of revi&s;iting Scotland this &s;ummer, and con&s;equently of &s;eeing you at Aberdeen, I had &s;ooner ac|knowledged, by letter, the favour you have done me.

<P>SINCE I had the plea&s;ure of receiving your la&s;t letter, which did not reach me till I had left the North, and was come to London, I have been confined to my room with a fit of the gout: now I am recovered and in quiet at Cambridge, I take up my pen to thank you for your very friendly offers, which have &s;o much the air of frankne&s;s and real good-meaning, that were my body as tractable and ea&s;y of conveyance as my mind, you would &s;ee me to-morrow in the chamber you have &s;o ho&s;pitably laid out for me at Aberdeen.

you. If you per&s;i&s;t in your de&s;ign, Mr. Foulis certainly ought to be acquainted with what I am now going to tell you. When I was in London the la&s;t &s;pring, Dod&s;ley, the book&s;eller, a&s;ked my leave to reprint, in a &s;maller form, all I ever pub|li&s;hed; to which I con&s;ented: and added, that I would &s;end him a few explanatory notes; and if he would omit entirely the <HI>Long Story,</HI> (which was never meant for the public, and only &s;uffered to appear in that pompous edition becau&s;e of Mr. Bentley's de&s;igns, which were not intelligible without it) I promi&s;ed to &s;end him &s;omething el&s;e to print in&s;tead of it, le&s;t the bulk of &s;o &s;mall a volume &s;hould be reduced to nothing at all. Now it is very certain that I had rather &s;ee them print|ed at Gla&s;gow (e&s;pecially as you will conde&s;cend to revi&s;e the pre&s;s) than at London; but I know not how to retract my pro|mi&s;e to Dod&s;ley. By the way, you perhaps may imagine that I have &s;ome kind of intere&s;t in this publication; but the truth is, I have none whatever. The expence is his, and &s;o is the profit, if there be any. I therefore told him the other day, in general terms, that I heard there would be an edition put out in Scotland by a friend of mine, whom I could not refu&s;e; and that, if &s;o, I would &s;end thither a copy of the &s;ame notes and additions that I had promi&s;ed to &s;end to him. This did not &s;eem at all to cool his courage; Mr. Foulis mu&s;t therefore judge for him&s;elf, whether he thinks it worth while to print what is going to be printed al&s;o at London. If he does, I will &s;end him (in a packet to you) the &s;ame things I &s;hall &s;end to Dod&s;|ley. They are imitations of two pieces of old Norwegian poe|try, in which there was a wild &s;pirit that &s;truck me: but for my paraphra&s;es I cannot &s;ay much; you will judge. The re&s;t are nothing but a few parallel pa&s;&s;ages, and &s;mall notes ju&s;t to

explain what people &s;aid at the time was wrapped in total darkne&s;s. You will plea&s;e to tell me, as &s;oon as you can con|veniently, what Mr. Foulis &s;ays on this head; that (if he drops the de&s;ign) I may &s;ave my&s;elf and you the trouble of this packet. I a&s;k your pardon for talking &s;o long about it; a little more, and my letter would be as big as all my works.</P>
<P>I have read, with much plea&s;ure, an Ode of yours (in which you have done me the honour to adopt a mea&s;ure that I have u&s;ed) on Lord Hay's birth-day. Though I do not love pane|gyric, I cannot but applaud this, for there is nothing mean in it. The diction is ea&s;y and noble, the texture of the thoughts lyric, and the ver&s;ification harmonious.

<P>IT is &s;ome time &s;ince I received from Mr. Foulis two copies of my poems, one by the hands of Mr. T. Pitt, the other by Mr. Merrill, a book&s;eller of this town: it is indeed a mo&s;t beautiful edition, and mu&s;t certainly do credit both to him and to me: but I fear it will be of no other advantage to him, as Dod&s;ley has contrived to glut the town already with two edi|tions beforehand, one of 1500, and the other of 750, both indeed far inferior to that of Gla&s;gow, but &s;old at half the price. I mu&s;t repeat my thanks, Sir, for the trouble you have been plea&s;ed to give your&s;elf on my account; and thro' you I mu&s;t de&s;ire leave to convey my acknowledgments to Mr. Foulis, for the pains and expence he has been at in this publication.</P>
<P>We live at &s;o great a di&s;tance, that, perhaps, you may not yet have learned, what, I flatter my&s;elf, you will not be di&s;|plea&s;ed to hear: the middle of la&s;t &s;ummer his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to appoint me Regius Profe&s;&s;or of Modern Hi&s;tory in this Univer&s;ity; it is the be&s;t thing the Crown has to be&s;tow (on a layman) here; the &s;alary is 400 l. per ann. but what enhances the value of it to me is, that it was be&s;towed without being a&s;ked. The per&s;on, who held it before me, died on the Sunday; and on Wedne&s;day following the Duke of Grafton wrote me a letter to &s;ay, that the King offered me this office,
<PB N="334" REF="337">
with many additional expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s on his Grace's part, to whom I am but little known, and whom I have not &s;een either before or &s;ince he did me this favour. In&s;tances of a benefit &s;o nobly conferred, I believe, are rare; and therefore I tell you of it as a thing that does honour, not only to me, but to the Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>As I lived here before from choice, I &s;hall now continue to do &s;o from obligation: if bu&s;ine&s;s or curio&s;ity &s;hould call you &s;outhwards, you will find few friends that will &s;ee you with more cordial &s;atisfaction, than, dear Sir, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION THE FIFTH.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reader will have gathered, from the preceding &s;eries of letters, that the greate&s;t part of Mr. Gray's life was &s;pent in that kind of learned lei&s;ure, which has only &s;elf-improvement and &s;elf-gratification for its object: He will probably be &s;urprized that, with &s;o very &s;trait an in|come, he &s;hould never have read with a view of making his re&s;earches lucrative to him&s;elf, or u&s;eful to the public. The truth was, Mr. Gray had ever expunged the word <HI>lucrative</HI> from his own vocabulary. He may be &s;aid to have been one of tho&s;e very few per&s;onages in the annals of literature, e&s;pecially in the poetical cla&s;s, who are devoid of &s;elf-intere&s;t, and at the &s;ame time attentive to economy; and al&s;o, among mankind in gene|ral, one of tho&s;e very few economi&s;ts who po&s;&s;e&s;s that talent, untinctured with the &s;lighte&s;t &s;tain of avarice. Were it my purpo&s;e in this place to expatiate on his moral excellencies, I &s;hould here add, that when his circum&s;tances were at the lowe&s;t, he gave away &s;uch &s;ums in private charity as would have done credit to an ampler pur&s;e: But it is rather my le&s;s-plea&s;ing pro|vince at pre&s;ent to acknowledge one of his foibles; and that was a certain degree of pride, which led him, of all other things, to de&s;pi&s;e the idea of being thought an author profe&s;&s;ed. I have been told indeed, that early in life he had an intention of pub|li&s;hing an edition of Strabo; and I find among&s;t his papers a
<PB N="336" REF="339">
great number of geographical di&s;qui&s;itions, particularly with re&s;pect to that part of A&s;ia which comprehends Per&s;ia and India; concerning the antient and modern names and divi&s;ions of which exten&s;ive countries, his notes are very copious. The indefati|gable pains which he al&s;o took with the writings of Plato, and the quantity of critical, as well as explanatory ob&s;ervations, which he has left upon almo&s;t every part of his works, plainly indicate, that no man in Europe was better prepared to republi&s;h and illu&s;trate that Philo&s;opher than Mr. Gray. Another work, on which he be&s;towed uncommon labour, was the <Q REND="inline">'Anthologia.'</Q> Among&s;t the books, which his friend&s;hip bequeathed to me, is Henry Stevens's edition of that collection of Greek Epigrams, interleaved; in which he has tran&s;cribed &s;everal additional ones that he &s;elected in his exten&s;ive reading, has in&s;erted a great number of critical notes and emendations, and &s;ubjoined a copious Index, in which every Epigram is arranged under the name of its re&s;pective author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It &s;hould &s;eem that Mr. Gray's pains were, on this occa&s;ion, very ill em|ployed; for the late Lord Che&s;terfield, writing to his &s;on, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"I hope you are got out of the wor&s;t company in the world, the Greek Epigrams. Martial has wit, and is worth looking into &s;ometimes; but I recommend the Greek Epi|grams to your &s;upreme contempt."</Q> See Lord Che&s;terfield's Letters, Lett. 73. However, if what Mr. Gray &s;ays be true, p. 233, &s;upra, that <Q REND="inline">"a dead Lord ranks only with Commoners,"</Q> there may come a time when Lord Che&s;terfield's dictum, in matters of ta&s;te, may not be held more infallible than that of his own and other dead Lords, in points of religion and morality: Nay, when his own plan of gentle manly education may be thought le&s;s capable of furni&s;hing his country with u&s;eful members of &s;ociety, than the plain old-fa&s;hioned one which he wrote to explode. If this day does not quickly come, one may, with|out pretending to a gift of prophecy, pronounce that England will neither be, nor de&s;erve to be, any thing better than a Province of France.</NOTE>. This manu&s;cript, though written in that exact manner, as if intended for the pre&s;s, I do not know that
<PB N="337" REF="340">
it was ever Mr. Gray's de&s;ign to make public. The only work, which he meditated upon with this direct view from the beginning, was a Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Poetry. He has men|tioned this him&s;elf in an adverti&s;ement prefixed to tho&s;e three fine imitations of Nor&s;e and Welch Poetry, which he gave the world in the la&s;t edition of his Poems. But the &s;light manner, in which he there &s;peaks of that de&s;ign, may admit here of &s;ome additional explanation. Several years ago I was indebted to the friend&s;hip of the pre&s;ent learned Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter for <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A tran&s;cript of this paper is to be found printed in the Life of Mr. Pope, written by Mr. Ruffhead.</NOTE>a curious manu&s;cript paper of Mr. Pope's, which contains the fir&s;t &s;ketch of a plan for a work of this kind, and which I have &s;till in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Mr. Gray was greatly &s;truck with the method which Mr. Pope had traced out in this little &s;ketch; and on my propo&s;al of engaging with him in compiling &s;uch a hi&s;tory, he examined the plan more accurately, enlarged it con|&s;iderably, and formed an idea for an introduction to it. In this was to be a&s;certained the origin of Rhyme; and &s;pecimens gi|ven, not only of the Proven&ccedil;al Poetry, (to which alone Mr. Pope &s;eemed to have adverted) but of the Scaldic, Briti&s;h, and Saxon; as, from all the&s;e different &s;ources united, Engli&s;h Poetry had its original: though it could hardly be called by that name till the time of Chaucer, with who&s;e &s;chool (i. e. the Poets who wrote in his manner) the hi&s;tory it&s;elf was intended to com|mence. The materials which I collected for this purpo&s;e are too incon&s;iderable to be mentioned: but Mr. Gray, be&s;ides ver|&s;ifying tho&s;e Odes that he publi&s;hed, made many elaborate di&s;|qui&s;itions into the origin of Rhyme, and that variety of Metre, to be found in the writings of our antient Poets. He al&s;o
<PB N="338" REF="341">
tran&s;cribed many parts of the voluminous Lidgate, from Manu|&s;cripts which he found in the Univer&s;ity Library and tho&s;e of private Colleges; remarking, as he went along, the &s;everal beau|ties and defects of this immediate &s;cholar of Chaucer. He how|ever &s;oon found that a work of this kind, pur&s;ued on &s;o very exten&s;ive a plan, would become almo&s;t endle&s;s: and hearing at the &s;ame time that Mr. Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity|College, Oxford, (of who&s;e abilities, from his ob&s;ervations on Spen&s;er, we had each of us conceived the highe&s;t opinion) was engaged in a work of the &s;ame kind, we by mutual con&s;ent relinqui&s;hed our undertaking; and &s;oon after, on that Gentle|man's de&s;iring a &s;ight of the plan, Mr. Gray readily &s;ent him a copy of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Gentleman has ju&s;t now politely acknowledged the favour in his pre|face to his fir&s;t volume on this &s;ubject. A work which, as he proceeds in it thro' more enlightened periods, will undoubtedly give the world as high an idea of his critical ta&s;te, as the pre&s;ent &s;pecimen does of his indefatigable re&s;earches into antiquity.</NOTE></P>
<P>At a time when I am enumerating the more con&s;iderable of Mr. Gray's antiquarian pur&s;uits, I mu&s;t not omit to mention his great knowledge of Gothic Architecture. He had &s;een, and accurately &s;tudied in his youth, while abroad, the Roman proportions on the &s;pot, both in antient ruins and in the works of Palladio. In his later years he applied him&s;elf to con&s;ider tho&s;e &s;tupendous &s;tructures of more modern date, that adorn our own country; which, if they have not the &s;ame grace, have undoubtedly equal dignity. He endeavoured to trace this mode of building, from the time it commenced, through its various changes, till it arrived at its perfection in the reign of Henry the Eighth, and ended in that of Elizabeth. For this purpo&s;e he
<PB N="339" REF="342">
did not &s;o much depend upon written accounts, as that internal evidence which the buildings them&s;elves give of their re&s;pective antiquity; &s;ince they con&s;tantly furni&s;h to the well-informed eye, arms, ornaments, and other undubitable marks, by which their &s;everal ages may be a&s;certained. On this account he ap|plied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of Heraldry as a preparatory &s;cience, and has left behind him a number of genealogical papers, more than &s;ufficient to prove him a complete ma&s;ter of it. By the&s;e means he arrived at &s;o very extraordinary a pitch of &s;agacity, as to be enabled to pronounce, at fir&s;t &s;ight, on the preci&s;e time when every particular part of any of our cathedrals was erected. He invented al&s;o &s;everal terms of art, the better to explain his meaning on this &s;ubject. I frequently pre&s;&s;ed him to dige&s;t the&s;e in a regular order; and offered, under his direction, to adapt a &s;et of drawings to them, which might de&s;cribe every ornament peculiarly in u&s;e in every different aera. But though he did not di&s;approve this hint, he neglected it; and has left no papers that would lead to its pro&s;ecution. I therefore mention it in this place, only to induce certain of his friends, to whom I know he communicated more of his thoughts upon this &s;ub|ject than to me, to pur&s;ue the de&s;ign, if they think it would be attended with utility to the public.</P>
<P>There is an Eloge on M. l'Abb&eacute; Le Beuf, publi&s;hed in the <Q REND="inline">"Hi&s;toiredel'Acad. des In&s;criptions &amp; Belles Lettres, vol. 29th,"</Q> by which it appears that Gentleman had preci&s;ely the &s;ame idea with Mr. Gray on this &s;ubject; and, by pur&s;uing it, had arri|ved at the &s;ame degree of &s;kill. <Q REND="inline">"Les Voyages &amp; les Lectures de M. l'Abb&eacute; Le Beuf l'avoient tellement familiari&s;&eacute; avec les monumens, qu'il apercevoit les differences les plus deli|cates

Joly de Fleury, to reduce into a body of &s;cience the di&s;coveries which he had made, that his ill health prevented him; but that the work is now in the hands of a per&s;on very capable of perfecting his idea. Yet I que&s;tion whether a work of this kind, from a French writer, will be of any great im|portance, &s;ince I am informed by a very competent judge, that the re&s;emblance between Gothic Architecture in England and in France is &s;urpri&s;ingly &s;light, except in the cathedral at Amiens, and a few other churches, &s;uppo&s;ed to be built by the Engli&s;h while in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of French provinces. The public has much more to hope from Mr. T. Warton's late promi&s;e to it, as he, of all other living writers, is be&s;t qualified to give complete &s;atisfaction to the curious on this &s;ubject: in the meanwhile, it may not be ami&s;s to inform the reader, that Mr. Bentham's Remarks on Saxon Churches, which make a part of an elaborate Introduction to his Hi&s;tory of Ely Cathedral, lately publi&s;hed, will convey to him many &s;entiments of Mr. Gray; as, among&s;t other Antiquaries, he contributed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to that Gentle|man;
<PB N="341" REF="344">
who, in his preface, has accordingly mentioned the obli|gation.</P>
<P>But the favourite &s;tudy of Mr. Gray, for the la&s;t ten years of his life, was Natural Hi&s;tory, which he then rather re&s;umed than began; as, by the in&s;tructions of his uncle Antrobus, he was a con&s;iderable botani&s;t at fifteen. He followed it clo&s;ely, and often &s;aid that he thought it a &s;ingular felicity to have en|gaged in it; as, be&s;ides the con&s;tant amu&s;ement it gave him in his chamber, it led him more frequently out into the fields; and, by making his life le&s;s &s;edentary, improved the general cour&s;e of his health and &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Habituated, as he had long been, to apply only to fir&s;t-rate Authors, as to the fountain-head of that knowledge, which he was at the time &s;olicitous to acquire, it is obvious that, when he re&s;olved to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Natural Hi&s;tory, he would immediately become the di&s;ciple of the great Lin|naeus. His fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s was to under&s;tand accurately his <Q REND="inline">"termini artis,"</Q> which he called ju&s;tly the learning a new ori|ginal language. He then went regularly through the vegetable, animal, and fo&s;&s;ile kingdoms. The marginal notes which he has left, not only on Linnaeus, but the many other authors which he read on the&s;e &s;ubjects, are very numerous: but the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are on Hud&s;on's Flora Anglica, and the tenth edition of the Sy&s;tema Naturae; which latter he interleaved, and filled almo&s;t entirely. While employed on Zoology, he al&s;o read Ari&s;totle's treati&s;e on that &s;ubject with great care, and explained many difficult pa&s;&s;ages of that ob&s;cure Antient, from the lights he had acquired from modern Naturali&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="345">
Having now given a general account of that variety of lite|rary pur&s;uits, which, in their turns, principally engaged his attention, and which were either not mentioned, or only glanced at in the preceding letters, let me be permitted to &s;ay a word or two of his amu&s;ements. The chief, and almo&s;t the only one of the&s;e, (if we except the frequent experiments he made on Flow|ers, in order to mark the mode and progre&s;s of their vegetation) was Mu&s;ic. His ta&s;te in this art was equal to his &s;kill in any more important &s;cience. It was founded on the be&s;t models, tho&s;e great ma&s;ters in Italy, who flouri&s;hed about the &s;ame time with his favourite Pergole&s;i. Of His and of Leo's, Bononcini's, Vinci's, and Ha&s;&s;e's works, he made a valuable collection while abroad, chiefly of &s;uch of their vocal compo&s;itions as he had him&s;elf heard and admired; ob&s;erving in his choice of the&s;e, the &s;ame judicious rule which he followed in making his collection of Prints; which was not &s;o much to get together complete &s;ets of the works of any ma&s;ter, as to &s;elect tho&s;e (the be&s;t in their kind) which would recall to his memory the capital Pictures, Statues, and Buildings which he had &s;een and &s;tudied. By this means, as he acquired in Painting great facility and accuracy in the knowledge of hands, &s;o in Mu&s;ic he gained &s;upreme &s;kill in the more refined powers of expre&s;&s;ion; e&s;pecially when we con|&s;ider that art as an adjunct to poetry: for vocal mu&s;ic, and that only, (excepting perhaps the le&s;&s;ons of the younger Scarlatti) was what he chiefly regarded. His in&s;trument was the Harp&s;i|cord; on which, though he had little execution, yet, when he &s;ung to it, he &s;o modulated the &s;mall powers of his voice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was much admired for his &s;inging in his youth; yet he was &s;o &s;hy in exerci&s;ing this talent, that Mr. Walpole tells me he never could but once prevail on him to give a proof of it; and then it was with &s;o much pain to him&s;elf, that it gave him no manner of plea&s;ure.</NOTE>, as
<PB N="343" REF="346">
to be able to convey to the intelligent hearer no common de|gree of &s;atisfaction. This, however, he could &s;eldom be pre|vailed upon to do, even by his mo&s;t intimate acquaintance.</P>
<P>To conclude this &s;light &s;ketch of his literary Character, I believe I may with great truth a&s;&s;ert, that excepting pure Ma|thematics, and the &s;tudies dependent on that &s;cience, there was hardly any part of human Learning, in which he had not acquired a competent &s;kill: in mo&s;t of them a confummate ma&s;tery.</P>
<P>I proceed now, as I did in the former &s;ections, to &s;elect, for the reader's peru&s;al, the la&s;t &s;eries of his Letters. They are few in number; yet contain all the incidents that occurred in that very &s;hort &s;pace of time, during which Providence was plea&s;ed further to continue him a ble&s;&s;ing to his friends, and an ornament to his country.</P>

He who be&s;t knows our nature (for he made us what we are) by &s;uch afflictions recalls us from our wander|ing thoughts and idle merriment; from the in&s;olence of youth and pro&s;perity, to &s;erious reflection, to our duty, and to him|&s;elf; nor need we ha&s;ten to get rid of the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions; time (by appointment of the &s;ame Power) will cure the &s;mart, and in &s;ome hearts &s;oon blot out all the traces of &s;orrow: but &s;uch as pre&s;erve them longe&s;t (for it is partly left in our own power) do perhaps be&s;t acquie&s;ce in the will of the cha&s;ti&s;er.</P>
<P>For the con&s;equences of this &s;udden lo&s;s, I &s;ee them well, and I think, in a like &s;ituation, could fortify my mind, &s;o as to &s;upport them with chearfulne&s;s and good hopes, though not naturally inclined to &s;ee things in their be&s;t a&s;pect.

<P>AND &s;o you have a garden of your own<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Nicholls, by having pur&s;ued the advice of his corre&s;pondent, we find was now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that competency which he wi&s;hed him. Happy, not only in having &s;o &s;age an advi&s;er, but in his own good &s;en&s;e which prompted him to follow &s;uch advice. The gaiety, whim, and humour of this letter contra&s;t prettily with the gravity and &s;erious reflection of the former.</NOTE>, and you plant and tran&s;plant, and are dirty and amu&s;ed! Are not you a&s;hamed of your&s;elf? Why, I have no &s;uch thing, you mon&s;ter, nor ever &s;hall be either dirty or amu&s;ed as long as I live. My gardens are in the windows like tho&s;e of a lodger up three pair of &s;tairs in Petticoat-Lane, or Camomile-Street, and they go to bed regularly under the &s;ame roof that I do. Dear, how charming it mu&s;t be to walk out in one's own <HI>garding,</HI> and &s;it on a bench in the open air, with a fountain and leaden &s;tatue, and a rolling &s;tone, and an arbour: have a care of &s;ore throats though, and the <HI>agoe.</HI></P>
<P>However, be it known to you, though I have no garden, I have &s;old my e&s;tate and got a thou&s;and guineas<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Con&s;i&s;ting of hou&s;es on the we&s;t &s;ide of Hand-Alley, London: Mrs. Olliffe was the Aunt here mentioned, who had a &s;hare in this e&s;tate, and for whom he procured this annuity. She died in 1771, a few months before her Nephew.</NOTE>, and four|&s;core pounds a year for my old Aunt, and a twenty pound prize
<PB N="347" REF="350">
in the lottery, and Lord knows what arrears in the trea&s;ury, and am a rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath had lo&s;&s;es, and one that hath two gowns, and every thing hand|&s;ome about him, and in a few days &s;hall have new window curtains: Are you avized of that? Ay, and a new mattra&s;s to lie upon.</P>
<P>My Ode has been rehear&s;ed again and again<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ode for Mu&s;ic on the Duke of Grafton's In&s;tallation. See Poems, p. 37. His rea&s;on for writing it is given in the next letter.</NOTE>,
and the &s;cholars have got &s;craps by heart: I expect to &s;ee it torn piece-meal in the North-Briton before it is born. If you will come you &s;hall &s;ee it, and &s;ing in it amid&s;t a chorus from Sali&s;bury and Glou|ce&s;ter mu&s;ic meeting, great names there, and all well ver&s;ed in Judas Maccabaeus. I wi&s;h it were once over; for then I im|mediately go for a few days to London, and &s;o with Mr. Brown to A&s;ton, though I fear it will rain the whole &s;ummer, and Skiddaw will be invi&s;ible and inacce&s;&s;ible to mortals.</P>
<P>I have got De la Landes' Voyage through Italy, in eight volumes; he is a member of the academy of &s;ciences, and pretty good to read. I have read too an octavo volume of Shen&s;tone's Letters: Poor man! he was always wi&s;hing for mo|ney, for fame, and other di&s;tinctions; and his whole philo&s;ophy con&s;i&s;ted in living again&s;t his will in retirement, and in a place which his ta&s;te had adorned; but which he only enjoyed when people of note came to &s;ee and commend it: his corre&s;pondence is about nothing el&s;e but this place and his own writings, with two or three neighbouring Clergymen who wrote ver&s;es too.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="351">
I have ju&s;t found the beginning of a letter, which &s;omebody had dropped: I &s;hould rather call it fir&s;t-thoughts for the be|ginning of a letter; for there are many &s;cratches and correc|tions. As I cannot u&s;e it my&s;elf, (having got a beginning al|ready of my own) I &s;end it for your u&s;e on &s;ome great occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>THE late ceremony of the Duke of Grafton's in&s;tallation has hindered me from acknowledging &s;ooner the &s;ati&s;|faction your friendly compliment gave me: I thought my&s;elf bound in gratitude to his Grace, una&s;ked, to take upon me the ta&s;k of writing tho&s;e ver&s;es which are u&s;ually &s;et to mu&s;ic on

I do not think them worth &s;ending you, becau&s;e they are by nature doomed to live but a &s;ingle day; or, if their exi&s;tence is prolonged beyond that date, it is only by means of news-paper parodies, and witle&s;s critici&s;ms.

<P>I Hope you got &s;afe and well home after that trouble&s;ome night<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Wharton, who had intended to accompany Mr. Gray to Ke&s;wick, was &s;eized at Brough with a violent fit of his a&s;thma, which obliged him to return home. This was the rea&s;on that Mr. Gray undertook to write the following journal of his tour for his friend's amu&s;ement. He &s;ent it under different covers. I give it here in continuation. It may not be ami&s;s, however, to hint to the reader, that if he expects to find elaborate and nicely-turned periods in this nar|ration, he will be greatly di&s;appointed. When Mr. Gray de&s;cribed places, he aimed only to be exact, clear, and intelligible; to convey peculiar, not gene|ral ideas, and to paint by the eye, not the fancy. There have been many ac|counts of the We&s;tmoreland and Cumberland lakes, both before and &s;ince this was written, and all of them better calculated to plea&s;e readers, who are fond of what they call <HI>fine writing:</HI> Yet tho&s;e who can content them&s;elves with an ele|gant &s;implicity of narrative, will, I flatter my&s;elf, find this to their ta&s;te; they will perceive it was written with a view, rather to inform than &s;urprize; and, if they make it their companion when they take the &s;ame tour, it will inhance their opinion of its intrin&s;ic excellence; in this way I tried it my&s;elf before I re&s;olved to print it.</NOTE>. I long to hear you &s;ay &s;o. For me I have con|tinued well, been &s;o favoured by the weather, that my walks have never once been hindered till ye&s;terday (that is a fortnight
<PB N="351" REF="354">
and three or four days, and a journey of more than 300 miles.) I am now at A&s;ton for two days. To-morrow I go to Cam|bridge. Ma&s;on is not here, but Mr. Alder&s;on receives me. According to my promi&s;e I &s;end you the fir&s;t &s;heet of my journal, to be continued without end.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 30. A mile and a half from Brough, where we parted, on a hill lay a great army <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There is a great fair for cattle kept on the hill near Brough on this day and the preceding.</NOTE> encamped: To the left opened a fine valley with green meadows and hedge-rows, a gentleman's hou&s;e peeping forth from a grove of old trees. On a nearer approach appeared myriads of cattle and hor&s;es in the road it|&s;elf, and in all the fields round me, a bri&s;k &s;tream hurrying cro&s;s the way, thou&s;ands of clean healthy people in their be&s;t party-coloured apparel: Farmers and their families, E&s;quires and their daughters ha&s;tening up from the dales and down the fells from every quarter, glittering in the &s;un, and pre&s;&s;ing forward to join the throng. While the dark hills, on who&s;e tops the mi&s;ts were yet hanging, &s;erved as a contra&s;t to this gay and moving &s;cene, which continued for near two miles
<PB N="352" REF="355">
more along the road, and the croud (coming towards it) reach|ed on as far as Appleby. On the a&s;cent of the hill above Appleby the thick hanging wood, and the long reaches of the Eden, clear, rapid, and full as ever, winding below, with views of the ca&s;tle and town, gave much employment to the mirror<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gray carried u&s;ually with him on the&s;e tours a Plano-convex Mirror of about four inches diameter on a black foil, and bound up like a pocket-book. A gla&s;s of this &s;ort is perhaps the be&s;t and mo&s;t convenient &s;ub&s;titute for a Camera Ob&s;cura, of any thing that has hitherto been invented, and may be had of any optician.</NOTE>; but now the &s;un was wanting, and the &s;ky overca&s;t. Oats and barley cut every where, but not carried in. Pa&s;&s;ed Kirbythore, Sir William Dal&s;ton's hou&s;e at Acorn-Bank, Whinfield Park, Harthorn Oaks, Counte&s;s-Pillar, Brougham-Ca&s;tle, Mr. Brown's large new hou&s;e; cro&s;&s;ed the Eden and the Eimot (pronounce Eeman) with its green vale, and dined at three o'clock with Mrs. Buchanan at Penrith, on trout and partridge. In the afternoon walked up Beacon-hill, a mile to the top, and could &s;ee Ul&s;water through an opening in the bo&s;om of that clu&s;ter of broken mountains, which the Doctor well remembers, Whin|field and Lowther Parks, &amp;c. and the craggy tops of an hun|dred namele&s;s hills: The&s;e lie to we&s;t and &s;outh. To the north, a great extent of black and dreary plains. To the ea&s;t, Cro&s;s-fell, ju&s;t vi&s;ible through mi&s;ts and vapours hovering round it.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 1. A grey autumnal day, the air perfectly calm and mild, went to &s;ee Ul&s;water, five miles di&s;tant; &s;oon left the Ke&s;wick-road, and turned to the left through &s;hady lanes along the vale of Eeman, which runs rapidly on near the way, rip|ling
<PB N="353" REF="356">
over the &s;tones; to the right is Delmaine, a large fabrick of pale red &s;tone, with nine windows in front and &s;even on the &s;ide, built by Mr. Ha&s;sle, behind it a fine lawn &s;urrounded by woods, and a long rocky eminence ri&s;ing over them: a clear and bri&s;k rivulet runs by the hou&s;e to join the Eeman, who&s;e cour&s;e is in &s;ight and at a &s;mall di&s;tance. Farther on appears Hatton St. John, a ca&s;tle-like old man&s;ion of Mr. Huddle&s;ton. Approached Dunmallert, a fine-pointed hill covered with wood, planted by old Mr. Ha&s;sle before-mentioned, who lives always at home, and delights in planting. Walked over a &s;pungy mea|dow or two, and began to mount the hill through a broad &s;traight green alley among the trees, and with &s;ome toil gained the &s;ummit. From hence &s;aw the lake opening directly at my feet, maje&s;tic in its calmne&s;s, clear and &s;mooth as a blue mir|ror, with winding &s;hores and low points of land covered with green inclo&s;ures, white farm-hou&s;es looking out among the trees, and cattle feeding. The water is almo&s;t every where bordered with cultivated lands, gently &s;loping upwards from a mile to a quarter of a mile in breadth, till they reach the feet of the mountains, which ri&s;e very rude and awful with their broken tops on either hand. Directly in front, at better than three miles di&s;tance, Place-Fell, one of the brave&s;t among them, pu&s;hes its bold broad brea&s;t into the mid&s;t of the lake, and forces it to alter its cour&s;e, forming fir&s;t a large bay to the left, and then bending to the right. I de&s;cended Dunmallert again by a &s;ide avenue, that was only not perpendicular, and came to Barton-bridge over the Eeman; then walking through a path in the wood round the bottom of the hill, came forth where the Eeman i&s;&s;ues out of the lake, and continued my way along its we&s;tern &s;hore clo&s;e to the water, and generally on a
<PB N="354" REF="357">
level with it. Saw a cormorant flying over it and fi&s;hing. The figure of the lake nothing re&s;embles that laid down in our maps: It is nine miles long; and at wide&s;t under a mile in breadth. After extending it&s;elf three miles and a half in a line to &s;outh|we&s;t, it turns at the foot of Place-Fell almo&s;t due we&s;t, and is here not twice the breadth of the Thames at London. It is &s;oon again interrupted by the root of Helvellyn, a lofty and very rugged mountain, and &s;preading again turns off to &s;outh|ea&s;t, and is lo&s;t among the deep rece&s;&s;es of the hills. To this &s;econd turning I pur&s;ued my way about four miles along its bor|ders beyond a village &s;cattered among trees, and called Water|Mallock, in a plea&s;ant grave day, perfectly calm and warm, but without a gleam of &s;un&s;hine; then the &s;ky &s;eeming to thick|en, and the valley to grow more de&s;olate, and evening drawing on, I returned by the way I came to Penrith.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 2. I &s;et out at ten for Ke&s;wick, by the road we went in 1767; &s;aw Grey&s;tock town and ca&s;tle to the right, which lie about three miles from Ul&s;water over the fells; pa&s;&s;ed through Penradoch and Threlcot at the foot of Saddleback, who&s;e &s;ur|rowed &s;ides were gilt by the noon-day &s;un, whil&s;t its brow appeared of a &s;ad purple from the &s;hadow of the clouds as they &s;ailed &s;lowly by it. The broad and green valley of Gardies and Low&s;ide, with a &s;wift &s;tream glittering among the cottages and meadows lay to the left, and the much finer but narrower valley of St. John's opening into it: Hill-top, the large though low man&s;ion of the Ga&s;karths, now a farm-hou&s;e, &s;eated on an emi|nence among woods, under a &s;teep fell, was what appeared the mo&s;t con&s;picuous, and be&s;ide it a great rock, like &s;ome ancient tower nodding to its fall. Pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;ide of Skiddaw and
<PB N="355" REF="358">
its cub called Latter-rig; and &s;aw from an eminence, at two miles di&s;tance, the vale of Ely&s;ium in all its verdure; the &s;un then playing on the bo&s;om of the lake, and lighting up all the mountains with its lu&s;tre. Dined by two o'Clock at the Queen's Head, and then &s;traggled out alone to the Par&s;onage, where I &s;aw the &s;un &s;et in all its glory.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 3. A heavenly day; ro&s;e at &s;even and walked out under the conduct of my landlord to Borrowdale; the gra&s;s was co|vered with a hoar-fro&s;t, which &s;oon melted and exhaled in a thin blui&s;h &s;moke; cro&s;&s;ed the meadows, obliquely catching a diver&s;ity of views among the hills over the lake and i&s;lands, and changing pro&s;pect at every ten paces. Left Cock&s;hut (which we formerly mounted) and Ca&s;tle-hill, a loftier and more rugged hill behind me, and drew near the foot of Walla|crag, who&s;e bare and rocky brow cut perpendicularly down above 400 feet (as I gue&s;s, though the people called it much more) awfully overlooks the way. Our path here tends to the left, and the ground gently ri&s;ing and covered with a glade of &s;cattering trees and bu&s;hes on the very margin of the water, opens both ways the mo&s;t delicious view that my eyes ever be|held; oppo&s;ite are the thick woods of Lord Egremont and Newland-valley, with green and &s;miling fields embo&s;omed in the dark cliffs; to the left the jaws of Borrowdale, with that turbulent chaos of mountain behind mountain, rolled in con|fu&s;ion; beneath you and &s;tretching far away to the right, the &s;hining purity of the lake reflecting rocks, woods, fields, and in|verted tops of hills, ju&s;t ruffled by the breeze, enough to &s;hew it is alive, with the white buildings of Ke&s;wick, Cro&s;thwaite church, and Skiddaw for a back ground at a di&s;tance. Behind
<PB N="356" REF="359">
you the magnificent heights of Walla-crag: here the gla&s;s play|ed its part divinely, the place is called Carf-clo&s;e-reeds; and I cho&s;e to &s;et down the&s;e barbarous names, that any body may enquire on the place, and ea&s;ily find the particular &s;tation that I mean. This &s;cene continues to Barrow-gate; and a little farther, pa&s;&s;ing a brook called Barrow-beck, we entered Bor|rowdale: the crags named Lawdoor-banks begin now to im|pend terribly over your way, and more terribly when you hear that three years &s;ince an immen&s;e ma&s;s of rock tumbled at once from the brow, and barred all acce&s;s to the dale (for this is the only road) till they could work their way through it. Luckily no one was pa&s;&s;ing at the time of this fall; but down the &s;ide of the mountain, and far into the lake, lie di&s;per&s;ed the huge fragments of this ruin in all &s;hapes and in all di|rections: &s;omething farther we turned a&s;ide into a coppice, a&s;cending a little in front of Lawdoor water-fall; the height appeared to be about 200 feet, the quantity of water not great, though (the&s;e three days excepted) it had rained daily in the hills for near two months before: but then the &s;tream was nobly broken, leaping from rock to rock, and foaming with fury. On one &s;ide a towering crag that &s;pired up to equal, if not overtop the neighbouring cliffs (this lay all in &s;hade and darkne&s;s): on the other hand a rounder broader projecting hill &s;hagged with wood, and illuminated by the &s;un, which glanced &s;ideways on the upper part of the cataract. The force of the water wearing a deep channel in the ground, hurries away to join the lake. We de&s;cended again and pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tream over a rude bridge. Soon after we came under Gowdar-crag, a hill more formidable to the eye, and to the apprehen&s;ion, than that of Lawdoor; the rocks at top deep-cloven perpendicularly, by
<PB N="357" REF="360">
the rains, hanging loo&s;e and nodding forwards, &s;eem ju&s;t &s;tart|ing from their ba&s;e in &s;hivers. The whole way down, and the road on both &s;ides is &s;trewed with piles of the fragments &s;trange|ly thrown acro&s;s each other, and of a dreadful bulk; the place reminds me of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;es in the Alps, where the guides tell you to move on with &s;peed, and &s;ay nothing, le&s;t the agitation of the air &s;hould loo&s;en the &s;nows above, and bring down a ma&s;s that would overwhelm a caravan. I took their coun&s;el here and ha&s;tened on in &s;ilence.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Non ragioniam di lor, ma guarda, e pa&s;&s;a!</HI></L></Q>
<P>The hills here are cloathed all up their &s;teep &s;ides with Oak, A&s;h, Birch, Holly, &amp;c. &s;ome of it has been cut forty years ago, &s;ome within the&s;e eight years; yet all is &s;prung again, green, flouri&s;hing, and tall, for its age, in a place where no &s;oil appears but the &s;taring rock, and where a man could &s;carce &s;tand upright: here we met a civil young farmer over&s;eeing his reapers (for it is now oat-harve&s;t) who conducted us to a neat white hou&s;e in the village of Grange, which is built on a ri&s;ing ground in the mid&s;t of a valley; round it the mountains form an awful amphitheatre, and through it obliquely runs the Derwent clear as gla&s;s, and &s;hewing under its bridge every trout that pa&s;&s;es. Be&s;ide the village ri&s;es a round eminence of rock covered intirely with old trees, and over that more proudly towers Ca&s;tle-crag, inve&s;ted al&s;o with wood on its &s;ides, and bearing on its naked top &s;ome traces of a fort &s;aid to be Ro|man. By the &s;ide of this hill, which almo&s;t blocks up the way, the valley turns to the left, and contracts its dimen&s;ions till there is hardly any road but the rocky bed of the river. The wood of the mountains increa&s;es, and their &s;ummits grow
<PB N="358" REF="361">
loftier to the eye, and of more fanta&s;tic forms; among them ap|pear Eagle's-cliff, Dove's-ne&s;t, Whitedale-pike, &amp;c. celebrated names in the annals of Ke&s;wick. The dale opens about four miles higher till you come to Sea-whaite (where lies the way mounting the hills to the right that leads to the Wadd-mines); all farther acce&s;s is here barred to prying mortals, only there is a little path winding over the fells, and for &s;ome weeks in the year pa&s;&s;able to the dale&s;men; but the mountains know well that the&s;e innocent people will not reveal the my&s;teries of their ancient kingdom, <Q REND="inline">"the reign of Chaos and Old Night:"</Q> only I learned that this dreadful road, dividing again, leads one branch to Ravenglas, and the other to Hawk&s;head.</P>
<P>For me I went no farther than the farmer's (better than four miles from Ke&s;wick) at Grange; his mother and he brought us butter that Si&s;erah would have jumped at, though not in a lordly di&s;h, bowls of milk, thin oaten-cakes, and ale; and we had carried a cold tongue thither with us. Our farmer was him&s;elf the man, that la&s;t year plundered the eagle's eyrie; all the dale are up in arms on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, for they lo&s;e abundance of lambs yearly, not to mention hares, partridges, grou&s;e, &amp;c. He was let down from the cliff in ropes to the &s;helf of the rock on which the ne&s;t was built, the people above &s;hout|ing and hollowing to fright the old birds, which flew &s;cream|ing round, but did not dare to attack him. He brought off the eaglet (for there is rarely more than one) and an addle egg. The ne&s;t was roundi&s;h, and more than a yard over, made of twigs twi&s;ted together. Seldom a year pa&s;&s;es but they take the brood or eggs, and &s;ometimes they &s;hoot one, &s;ometimes the other, parent; but the &s;urvivor has always found a mate (pro|bably
<PB N="359" REF="362">

<P>We returned lei&s;urely home the way we came; but &s;aw a new land&s;cape; the features indeed were the &s;ame in part, but many new ones were di&s;clo&s;ed by the mid-day &s;un, and the tints were intirely changed; take notice this was the be&s;t, or perhaps the only day for going up Skiddaw, but I thought it better em|ployed; it was perfectly &s;erene, and hot as mid&s;ummer.</P>
<P>In the evening I walked alone down to the lake by the &s;ide of Crow-park after &s;un&s;et, and &s;aw the &s;olemn colouring of night draw on, the la&s;t gleam of &s;un&s;hine fading away on the hill|tops, the deep &s;erene of the waters, and the long &s;hadows of the mountains thrown acro&s;s them, till they nearly touched the hithermo&s;t &s;hore. At a di&s;tance were heard the murmurs of many water-falls, not audible in the day-time; I wi&s;hed for the moon, but &s;he was <HI>dark to me and &s;ilent,</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Hid in her vacant interlunar cave.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 4. I walked to Crow-park, now a rough pa&s;ture, once a glade of ancient oaks, who&s;e large roots &s;till remain on the ground, but nothing has &s;prung from them. If one &s;ingle tree had remained, this would have been an unparallel'd &s;pot; and Smith judged right, when he took his print of the lake from hence, for it is a gentle eminence, not too high, on the very margin of the water, and commanding it from end to end, looking full into the gorge of Borrowdale. I prefer it even to
<PB N="360" REF="363">
Cock&s;hut-hill which lies be&s;ide it, and to which I walked in the afternoon; it is covered with young trees both &s;own and planted, oak, &s;pruce, Scotch-fir, &amp;c. all which thrive wonder|fully. There is an ea&s;y a&s;cent to the top, and the view far pre|ferable to that on Ca&s;tle-hill (which you remember) becau&s;e this is lower and nearer to the lake: for I find all points, that are much elevated, &s;poil the beauty of the valley, and make its parts, which are not large, look poor and diminutive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Picture&s;que Point</HI> is always thus low in all pro&s;pects: A truth, which though the Land&s;cape Painter knows, he cannot always ob&s;erve; &s;ince the Patron who employs him to take a view of his piace, u&s;ually carries him to &s;ome elevation for that purpo&s;e, in order, I &s;uppo&s;e, that he may have more of him for his money. Yet when I &s;ay this, I would not be thought to mean that a drawing &s;hould be made from the lowe&s;t point po&s;&s;ible; as for in&s;tance, in this very view, from the lake it&s;elf, for then a foreground would be wanting. On this account, when I failed on Derwentwater, I did not receive &s;o much plea&s;ure from the &s;uperb am|phitheatre of mountains around me, as when, like Mr. Gray, I traver&s;ed its margin; and I therefore think he did not lo&s;e much by not taking boat.</NOTE>. While I was here a little &s;hower fell, red clouds came marching up the hills from the ea&s;t, and part of a bright rainbow &s;eemed to ri&s;e along the &s;ide of Ca&s;tle-hill.</P>
<P>From hence I got to the Par&s;onage a little before &s;un&s;et, and &s;aw in my gla&s;s a picture, that if I could tran&s;mit to you, and fix it in all the &s;oftne&s;s of its living colours, would fairly &s;ell for a thou&s;and pounds. This is the &s;weete&s;t &s;cene I can yet di&s;cover in point of pa&s;toral beauty; the re&s;t are in a &s;ublimer &s;tyle.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 5. I walked through the meadows and corn-fields to the Derwent, and cro&s;&s;ing it went up How-hill; it looks along Ba&s;&s;inthwait-water, and &s;ees at the &s;ame time the cour&s;e of the river, and a part of the upper-lake, with a full view of Skid|daw:
<PB N="361" REF="364">
then I took my way through Porting&s;kall village to the Park, a hill &s;o called, covered entirely with wood; it is all a ma&s;s of crumbling &s;late. Pa&s;&s;ed round its foot between the trees and the edge of the water, and came to a penin&s;ula that juts out into the lake, and looks along it both ways; in front ri&s;es Walla-crag and Ca&s;tle-hill, the town, the road to Penrith, Skiddaw, and Saddleback. Returning, met a bri&s;k and cold north-ea&s;tern bla&s;t that ruffled all the &s;urface of the lake, and made it ri&s;e in little waves that broke at the foot of the wood. After dinner walked up the Penrith road two miles, or more, and turning into a corn-field to the right, called Ca&s;tle-rig, &s;aw a Druid-circle of large &s;tones, 108 feet in diameter, the bigge&s;t not eight feet high, but mo&s;t of them &s;till erect; they are fifty in number<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this piece of antiquity more fully de&s;cribed, with a plate annexed, by Mr. Pennant in his Second Tour to Scotland in 1772, p. 38.</NOTE>.

<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 6. Went in a chai&s;e eight miles along the ea&s;t-&s;ide of Ba&s;&s;ingthwaite water to Ou&s;ebridge (pronounced Ews-bridge); the road in &s;ome part made and very good, the re&s;t &s;lippery and dangerous cart-road, or narrow rugged lanes, but no precipices; it runs directly along the foot of Skiddaw: oppo&s;ite to Widhope|brows, cloathed to the top with wood, a very beautiful view opens down to the lake, which is narrower and longer than that of Ke&s;wick, le&s;s broken into bays, and without i&s;lands<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is &s;omewhat extraordinary that Mr. Gray omitted to mention the i&s;lands on Derwentwater; one of which, I think they call it Vicars' I&s;land, makes a principal object in the &s;cene.

the foot of it, a few paces from the brink, gently &s;loping upward, &s;tands Armathwate in a thick grove of Scotch firs, commanding a noble view directly up the lake: at a &s;mall di|&s;tance behind the hou&s;e is a large extent of wood, and &s;till behind this a ridge of cultivated hills, on which, according to the Ke&s;wick proverb, <HI>the &s;un always &s;hines.</HI> The inhabitants here, on the contrary, call the vale of Derwentwater, <HI>the Devil's chamber-pot,</HI> and pronounce the name of <HI>Skiddaw-fell,</HI> which terminates here, with a &s;ort of terror and aver&s;ion. Armathwate hou&s;e is a modern fabrick, not large, and built of dark-red &s;tone, belonging to Mr. Spedding, who&s;e grandfather was &s;tew|ard to old Sir James Lowther, and bought this e&s;tate of the Himers. The &s;ky was overca&s;t and the wind cool; &s;o, after dining at a publick-hou&s;e, which &s;tands here near the bridge, (that cro&s;&s;es the Derwent ju&s;t where it i&s;&s;ues from the lake) and &s;auntering a little by the water-&s;ide, I came home again. The turnpike is fini&s;hed from Cockermouth hither, five miles, and is carrying on to Penrith: &s;everal little &s;howers to-day. A man came in, who &s;aid there was &s;now on Cro&s;s-fell this morning.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 7. I walked in the morning to Crow-park, and in the evening up Penrith road. The clouds came rolling up the mountains all round very dark, yet the moon &s;hone at intervals. It was too damp to go towards the lake. To-morrow I mean to bid farewel to Ke&s;wick.</P>
<P>Botany might be &s;tudied here to great advantage at another &s;ea&s;on, becau&s;e of the great variety of &s;oils and elevations, all lying within a &s;mall compa&s;s. I ob&s;erved nothing but &s;everal
<PB N="363" REF="366">
curious lichens, and plenty of gale or Dutch myrtle perfuming the borders of the lake. This year the Wadd-mine had been opened, which is done once in five years; it is taken out in lumps &s;ometimes as big as a man's fi&s;t, and will undergo no preparation by fire, not being fu&s;ible; when it is pure, &s;oft, black, and clo&s;e-grained, it is worth &s;ometimes thirty &s;hillings a pound. There are no charr ever taken in the&s;e lakes, but plenty in Butter-mere-water, which lies a little way north of Borrowdale, about Martinmas, which are potted here. They &s;ow chiefly oats and bigg here, which are now cutting and &s;till on the ground; the rains have done much hurt: yet ob&s;erve, the &s;oil is &s;o thin and light, that no day has pa&s;&s;ed in which I could not walk out with ea&s;e, and you know I am no lover of dirt. Fell mutton is now in &s;ea&s;on for about &s;ix weeks; it grows fat on the mountains, and nearly re&s;embles veni&s;on. Ex|cellent pike and perch, here called Ba&s;s; trout is out of &s;ea&s;on; partridge in great plenty.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 8. I left Ke&s;wick and took the Amble&s;ide road in a gloomy morning; and about two miles from the town mounted an eminence called Ca&s;tle-rigg, and the &s;un breaking out, di&s;|covered the mo&s;t enchanting view I have yet &s;een of the whole valley behind me, the two lakes, the river, the mountains all in their glory; &s;o that I had almo&s;t a mind to have gone back again. The road in &s;ome few parts is not compleated, yet good country road, through &s;ound but narrow and &s;tony lanes, very &s;afe in broad day-light. This is the ca&s;e about Cau&s;eway|foot, and among Naddle-fells to Lancwaite. The vale you go in has little breadth; the mountains are va&s;t and rocky, the fields little and poor, and the inhabitants are now making hay,
<PB N="364" REF="367">
and &s;ee not the &s;un by two hours in a day &s;o long as at Ke&s;|wick. Came to the foot of Helvellyn, along which runs an excellent road, looking down from a little height on Lee's-water, (called al&s;o Thirl-meer, or Wiborn-water) and &s;oon de&s;cending on its margin. The lake looks black from its depth, and from the gloom of the va&s;t crags that &s;cowl over it, though really clear as gla&s;s; it is narrow, and about three miles long, re&s;embling a river in its cour&s;e; little &s;hining torrents hurry down the rocks to join it, but not a bu&s;h to over&s;hadow them, or cover their march; all is rock and loo&s;e &s;tones up to the very brow, which lies &s;o near your way, that not above half the height of Helvellyn can be &s;een.</P>
<P>Next I pa&s;&s;ed by the little chapel of Wiborn, out of which the Sunday congregation were then i&s;&s;uing; &s;oon after a beck near Dunmeil-rai&s;e, when I entered We&s;tmoreland a &s;econd time; and now began to &s;ee Holm-crag, di&s;tingui&s;hed from its rugged neighbours, not &s;o much by its height as by the &s;trange broken outlines of its top, like &s;ome gigantick building demoli&s;hed, and the &s;tones that compo&s;ed it flung cro&s;s each other in wild confu&s;ion. Ju&s;t beyond it opens one of the &s;weet|e&s;t land&s;capes that art ever attempted to imitate. The bo&s;om of the mountains &s;preading here into a broad ba&s;on di&s;covers in the mid&s;t Gra&s;mere-water; its margin is hollowed into &s;mall bays, with bold eminences; &s;ome of rock, &s;ome of &s;oft turf, that half-conceal, and vary the figure of the little lake they command: from the &s;hore, a low promontory pu&s;hes it&s;elf far into the water, and on it &s;tands a white village with the pari&s;h church ri&s;ing in the mid&s;t of it: hanging inclo&s;ures, corn-fields, and meadows green as an emerald, with their trees and hedges, and
<PB N="365" REF="368">
cattle, fill up the whole &s;pace from the edge of the water: and ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to you is a large farm-hou&s;e at the bottom of a &s;teep &s;mooth lawn, embo&s;omed in old woods, which climb half-way up the mountain's &s;ide, and di&s;cover above them a broken line of crags that crown the &s;cene. Not a &s;ingle red tile, no flaring gentleman's hou&s;e, or garden-walls, break in upon the repo&s;e of this little un&s;u&s;pected paradi&s;e; but all is peace, ru&s;ticity, and happy poverty in its neate&s;t mo&s;t becoming attire.</P>
<P>The road winds here over Gra&s;mere-hill, who&s;e rocks &s;oon conceal the water from your &s;ight; yet it is continued along behind them, and, contracting it&s;elf to a river, communicates with Ridale-water, another &s;mall lake, but of inferior &s;ize and beauty; it &s;eems &s;hallow too, for large patches of reeds appear pretty far within it. Into this vale the road de&s;cends. On the oppo&s;ite banks large and ancient woods mount up the hills; and ju&s;t to the left of our way &s;tands Ridale-hall, the family-&s;eat of Sir Michael Fleming, a large old-fa&s;hioned fabrick, &s;ur|rounded with wood. Sir Michael is now on his travels, and all this timber, far and wide, belongs to him. Near the hou&s;e ri&s;es a huge crag, called Ridale-head, which is &s;aid to command a full view of Wynander-mere, and I doubt it not; for within a mile that great lake is vi&s;ible, even from the road: as to going up the crag, one might as well go up Skiddaw.</P>
<P>I now reached Amble&s;ide, eighteen miles from Ke&s;wick, meaning to lie there; but, on looking into the be&s;t bed-cham|ber, dark and damp as a cellar, grew delicate, gave up Wy|nander-mere in de&s;pair, and re&s;olved I would go on to Kendal
<PB N="366" REF="369">
directly, fourteen miles farther<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By not &s;taying a little at Amble&s;ide, Mr. Gray lo&s;t the &s;ight of two mo&s;t magnificent ca&s;cades; the one not above half a mile behind the inn, the other down Ridale-crag, where Sir Michael Fleming is now making a path-way to the top of it. The&s;e, when I &s;aw them, were in full torrent, whereas Lawdoor water-fall, which I vi&s;ited in the evening of the very &s;ame day, was almo&s;t with|out a &s;tream. Hence I conclude that this di&s;tingui&s;hed feature in the vale of Ke&s;wick, is, like mo&s;t northern rivers, only in high beauty during bad weather. But his greate&s;t lo&s;s was in not &s;eeing a &s;mall water-fall vi&s;ible only through the window of a ruined &s;ummer-hou&s;e in Sir Michael's orchard. Here Nature has performed every thing in little that &s;he u&s;ually executes on her large&s;t &s;cale; and on that account, like the miniature painter, &s;eems to have fini&s;hed every part of it in a &s;tudied manner; not a little fragment of rock thrown into the ba&s;on, not a &s;ingle &s;tem of bru&s;hwood that &s;tarts from its craggy &s;ides but has its picture&s;que meaning; and the little central &s;tream da&s;hing down a cleft of the darke&s;t|coloured &s;tone, produces an effect of light and &s;hadow beautiful beyond de&s;crip|tion. This little theatrical &s;cene might be painted as large as the original, on a canva&s;s not bigger than tho&s;e which are u&s;ually dropped in the Opera-hou&s;e.</NOTE>. The road in general fine turnpike, but &s;ome parts (about three miles in all) not made, yet without danger.</P>
<P>For this determination I was unexpectedly well rewarded: for the afternoon was fine, and the road, for the &s;pace of full five miles, ran along the &s;ide of Wynander-mere, with delicious views acro&s;s it, and almo&s;t from one end to the other. It is ten miles in length, and at mo&s;t a mile over, re&s;embling the cour&s;e of &s;ome va&s;t and magnificent river; but no flat mar&s;hy grounds, no o&s;ier|beds, or patches of &s;crubby plantations on its banks: at the head two vallies open among the mountains; one, that by which we came down, the other Lang&s;ledale, in which Wry-no&s;e and Hard|knot, two great mountains, ri&s;e above the re&s;t: from thence the fells vi&s;ibly &s;ink, and &s;often along its &s;ides; &s;ometimes they run
<PB N="367" REF="370">
into it (but with a gentle declivity) in their own dark and na|tural complexion: oftener they are green and cultivated, with farms inter&s;per&s;ed, and round eminences, on the border covered with trees: towards the &s;outh it &s;eemed to break into larger bays, with &s;everal i&s;lands and a wider extent of cultivation. The way ri&s;es continually, till at a place called Orre&s;t-head it turns &s;outh-ea&s;t, lo&s;ing &s;ight of the water.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ed by Ing's-Chapel and Staveley; but I can &s;ay no far|ther, for the du&s;k of evening coming on, I entered Kendal almo&s;t in the dark, and could di&s;tingui&s;h only a &s;hadow of the ca&s;tle on a hill, and tenter-grounds &s;pread far and wide round the town, which I mi&s;took for hou&s;es. My inn promi&s;ed &s;adly, having two wooden galleries, like Scotland, in front of it: it was indeed an old ill-contrived hou&s;e, but kept by civil &s;en&s;ible people; &s;o I &s;tayed two nights with them, and fared and &s;lept very comfortably.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 9. The air mild as &s;ummer, all corn off the ground, and the &s;ky-larks &s;inging aloud (by the way, I &s;aw not one at Ke&s;|wick, perhaps, becau&s;e the place abounds in birds of prey). I went up the ca&s;tle-hill; the town con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of three nearly parallel &s;treets, almo&s;t a mile long; except the&s;e, all the other hou&s;es &s;eem as if they had been dancing a country-dance, and were out: there they &s;tand back to back, corner to corner, &s;ome up hill, &s;ome down, without intent or meaning. Along by their &s;ide runs a fine bri&s;k &s;tream, over which are three &s;tone|bridges; the buildings (a few comfortable hou&s;es excepted) are mean, of &s;tone, and covered with a bad rough ca&s;t. Near the end of the town &s;tands a hand&s;ome hou&s;e of Col. Wil&s;on's, and
<PB N="368" REF="371">
adjoining to it the church, a very large gothick fabrick, with a &s;quare tower; it has no particular ornaments but double i&s;les, and at the ea&s;t-end four chapels or choirs; one of the Parrs, another of the Stricklands; the third is the proper choir of the church, and the fourth of the Bellinghams, a family now ex|tinct. There is an altar-tomb of one of them dated 1577, with a flat bra&s;s, arms and quarterings; and in the window their arms alone, arg. a hunting-horn, &s;ab. &s;trung gules. In the Stricklands' chapel &s;everal modern monuments, and another old altar-tomb, not belonging to the family: on the &s;ide of it a fe&s;s dancetty between ten billets deincourt. In the Parr's chapel is a third altar-tomb in the corner, no figure or in&s;cription, but on the &s;ide, cut in &s;tone, an e&s;cutcheon of Roos of Kendal, (three water-budgets) quartering Parr (two bars in a bordure engrail|ed); 2dly, an e&s;cutcheon, vaire, a fe&s;s for marmion; 3dly, an e&s;cutcheon, three chevronels braced, and a chief (which I take for Fitzhugh): at the foot is an e&s;cutcheon, &s;urrounded with the garter, bearing Roos and Parr quarterly, quartering the other two before-mentioned. I have no books to look in, therefore cannot &s;ay whether this is the Lord Parr of Kendal, Queen Catharine's father, or her brother the Marquis of Northamp|ton: perhaps it is a cenotaph for the latter who was buried at Warwick in 1571. The remains of the ca&s;tle are &s;eated on a fine hill on the &s;ide of the river oppo&s;ite the town; almo&s;t the whole inclo&s;ure of the walls remains, with four towers, two &s;quare and two round, but their upper part and embattlements are demoli&s;hed: it is of rough &s;tone and cement, without any ornament or arms, round, inclo&s;ing a court of like form, and &s;urrounded by a moat; nor ever could it have been larger than it is, for there are no traces of outworks. There is a good view
<PB N="369" REF="372">
of the town and river, with a fertile open valley through which it winds.</P>
<P>After dinner I went along the Milthrop turnpike, four miles, to &s;ee the falls, or force, of the river Kent; came to Sizergh, (pronounced Si&s;er) and turned down a lane to the left. This &s;eat of the Stricklands, an old Catholick family, is an ancient hall-hou&s;e, with a very large tower embattled; the re&s;t of the buildings added to it are of later date, but all is white, and &s;een to advantage on a back ground of old trees; there is a &s;mall park al&s;o well wooded. Oppo&s;ite to this, turning to the left, I &s;oon came to the river; it works its way in a narrow and deep rocky channel overhung with trees. The calmne&s;s and bright|ne&s;s of the evening, the roar of the waters, and the thumping of huge hammers at an iron-forge not far di&s;tant, made it a &s;ingular walk; but as to the falls (for there are two) they are not four feet high. I went on, down to the forge, and &s;aw the demons at work by the light of their own fires: the iron is brought in pigs to Milthrop by &s;ea from Scotland, &amp;c. and is here beat into bars and plates. Two miles further, at Levens, is the &s;eat of Lord Suffolk, where he &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;es the &s;um|mer: it was a favourite place of his late Counte&s;s; but this I did not &s;ee.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 10. I proceeded by Burton to Lanca&s;ter, twenty-two miles; very good country, well inclo&s;ed and wooded, with &s;ome common inter&s;per&s;ed. Pa&s;&s;ed at the foot of Farlton-knot, a high fell four miles north of Lanca&s;ter; on a ri&s;ing ground called Boulton (pronounced Bouton) we had a full view of Cartmell|&s;ands, with here and there a pa&s;&s;enger riding over them (it
<PB N="370" REF="373">
being low water); the points of Furne&s;s &s;hooting far into the &s;ea, and lofty mountains, partly covered with clouds, extending north of them. Lanca&s;ter al&s;o appeared very con&s;picuous and fine; for its mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed features, the ca&s;tle and church, mounted on a green eminence, were all that could be &s;een. Woe is me! when I got thither, it was the &s;econd day of their fair; the inn, in the principal &s;treet, was a great old gloomy hou&s;e full of people; but I found tolerable quarters, and even &s;lept two nights in peace.</P>
<P>In a fine afternoon I a&s;cended the ca&s;tle-hill; it takes up the higher top of the eminence on which it &s;tands, and is irregu|larly round, encompa&s;&s;ed with a deep moat: in front, towards the town, is a magnificent gothic gateway, lofty and huge; the overhanging battlements are &s;upported by a triple range of corbels, the intervals pierced through, and &s;hewing the day from above. On its top ri&s;e light watch-towers of &s;mall height. It opens below with a grand pointed arch; over this is a wrought tabernacle, doubtle&s;s once containing its founder's figure; on one &s;ide a &s;hield of France &s;emy-quartered with England; on the other the &s;ame, with a label, ermine, for John of Gaunt, Duke of Lanca&s;ter. This opens to a court within, which I did not much care to enter, being the county-gaol, and full of pri|&s;oners, both criminals and debtors. From this gateway the walls continue and join it to a va&s;t &s;quare tower of great height, the lower part at lea&s;t of remote antiquity; for it has &s;mall round-headed lights with plain &s;hort pillars on each &s;ide of them: there is a third tower, al&s;o &s;quare and of le&s;s dimen&s;ions. This is all the ca&s;tle. Near it, and but little lower, &s;tands the church, a large and plain gothic fabrick; the high &s;quare tower
<PB N="371" REF="374">
at the we&s;t-end has been rebuilt of late years, but nearly in the &s;ame &s;tyle: there are no ornaments of arms, &amp;c. any where to be &s;een; within, it is light&s;ome and &s;pacious, but not one mo|nument of antiquity, or piece of painted gla&s;s is left. From the church-yard there is an exten&s;ive &s;ea-view, (for now the tide had almo&s;t covered the &s;ands, and filled the river) and be&s;ides the greate&s;t part of Furne&s;s, I could di&s;tingui&s;h Peel-ca&s;tle on the i&s;le of Fowdrey, which lies off its &s;outhern extremity. The town is built on the &s;lope, and at the foot of the ca&s;tle-hill, more than twice the bigne&s;s of Aukland, with many neat build|ings of white &s;tone, but a little di&s;orderly in their po&s;ition, and <Q REND="inline">"ad libitum"</Q>, like Kendal: many al&s;o extend below on the keys by the river-&s;ide, where a number of &s;hips were moored, &s;ome of them three-ma&s;ted ve&s;&s;els decked out with their colours in honour of the fair. Here is a good bridge of four arches over the Lune, that runs, when the tide is out, in two &s;treams divided by a bed of gravel, which is not covered but in &s;pring|tides; below the town it widens to near the breadth of the Thames at London, and meets the &s;ea at five or &s;ix miles di&s;|tance to &s;outh-we&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 11. I cro&s;&s;ed the river and walked over a penin&s;ula, three miles, to the village of Pooton, which &s;tands on the beach. An old fi&s;herman mending his nets (while I enquired about the danger of pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e &s;ands) told me, in his dialect, a moving &s;tory; how a brother of the trade, a Cockler, as he &s;tyled him, driving a little cart with two daughters (women grown) in it, and his wife on hor&s;eback following, &s;et out one day to pa&s;s the &s;even-mile &s;ands, as they had frequently been u&s;ed to do; (for nobody in the village knew them better than the old man
<PB N="372" REF="375">
did) when they were about half-way over, a thick fog ro&s;e, and as they advanced they found the water much deeper than they expected: the old man was puzzled; he &s;topped, and &s;aid he would go a little way to find &s;ome mark he was acquainted with; they &s;taid a while for him; but in vain; they called aloud, but no reply: at la&s;t the young women pre&s;&s;ed their mother to think where they were, and go on; &s;he would not leave the place; &s;he wandered about forlorn and amazed; &s;he would not quit her hor&s;e and get into the cart with them: they determi|ned, after much time wa&s;ted, to turn back, and give them&s;elves up to the guidance of their hor&s;es. The old woman was &s;oon wa&s;hed off, and peri&s;hed; the poor girls clung clo&s;e to their cart, and the hor&s;e, &s;ometimes wading and &s;ometimes &s;wim|ming, brought them back to land alive, but &s;en&s;ele&s;s with terror and di&s;tre&s;s, and unable for many days to give any ac|count of them&s;elves. The bodies of their parents were found next ebb; that of the father a very few paces di&s;tant from the &s;pot where he had left them.</P>
<P>In the afternoon I wandered about the town, and by the key, till it grew dark.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 12. I &s;et out for Settle by a fine turnpike-road, twenty|nine miles, through a rich and beautiful inclo&s;ed country, di|ver&s;ified with frequent villages and churches, very unequal ground; and on the left the river Lune winding in a deep val|ley, its hanging banks cloathed with fine woods, thro' which you catch long reaches of the water, as the road winds about at a con&s;iderable height above it. In the mo&s;t picture&s;que part of the way, I pa&s;&s;ed the park belonging to the Hon. Mr. Clif|ford,
<PB N="373" REF="376">
a Catholick. The grounds between him and the river are indeed charming<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;cene opens ju&s;t three miles from Lanca&s;ter, on what is called the Queen's Road. To &s;ee the view in perfection, you mu&s;t go into a field on the left. Here Ingleborough, behind a variety of le&s;&s;er mountains, makes the back|ground of the pro&s;pect: on each hand of the middle di&s;tance, ri&s;e two &s;loping hills; the left cloathed with thick woods, the right with variegated rock and herbage: between them, in the riche&s;t of vallies, the Lune &s;erpentizes for many a mile, and comes forth ample and clear, through a well-wooded and richly pa|&s;tured fore-ground. Every feature, which con&s;titutes a perfect land&s;cape of the exten&s;ive &s;ort, is here not only boldly marked, but al&s;o in its be&s;t po&s;ition.</NOTE>; the hou&s;e is ordinary, and the park nothing but a rocky fell &s;cattered over with ancient hawthorns. Next I came to Hornby, a little town on the river Wanning, over which a hand&s;ome bridge is now building; the ca&s;tle, in a lordly &s;ituation, attracted me, &s;o I walked up the hill to it: fir&s;t pre&s;ents it&s;elf a large white ordinary &s;a&s;hed Gentleman's hou&s;e, and behind it ri&s;es the ancient Keep, built by Edward Stanley, Lord Monteagle. He died about 1529, in King Henry the Eighth's time. It is now only a &s;hell, the rafters are laid within it as for flooring. I went up a winding &s;tone-&s;tair-ca&s;e in one corner to the leads, and at the angle is a &s;ingle hexagon watch-tower, ri&s;ing &s;ome feet higher, fitted up in the ta&s;te of a modern &s;ummer-hou&s;e, with &s;a&s;h-windows in gilt frames, a &s;tucco cupola, and on the top a va&s;t gilt eagle, built by Mr. Charteris, the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. He is the &s;econd &s;on of the Earl of Wemys, brother to the Lord Elcho, and grand&s;on to Col. Charteris, who&s;e name he bears.</P>
<P>From the leads of the tower there is a fine view of the coun|try round, and much wood near the ca&s;tle. Ingleborough, which I had &s;een before di&s;tinctly at Lanca&s;ter to north-ea&s;t,
<PB N="374" REF="377">
was now completely wrapped in clouds, all but its &s;ummit; which might have been ea&s;ily mi&s;taken for a long black cloud too, fraught with an approaching &s;torm. Now our road be|gun gradually to mount towards the Apennine, the trees grow|ing le&s;s and thinner of leaves, till we came to Ingleton, eigh|teen miles; it is a pretty village, &s;ituated very high, and yet in a valley at the foot of that huge mon&s;ter of nature, Ingleborough: two torrents cro&s;s it, with great &s;tones rolled along their beds in&s;tead of water; and over them are flung two hand&s;ome arches. The nipping air, tho' the afternoon was growing very bright, now taught us we were in Craven, the road was all up and down, though no where very &s;teep; to the left were mountain|tops, to the right a wide valley, all inclo&s;ed ground, and beyond it high hills again. In approaching Settle, the crags on the left drew nearer to our way, till we de&s;cended Brunton-brow into a chearful valley (though thin of trees) to Giggle&s;wick, a village with a &s;mall piece of water by its &s;ide, covered over with coots; near it a church, which belongs al&s;o to Settle; and half a mile farther, having pa&s;&s;ed the Ribble over a bridge, I arrived there; it is a &s;mall market-town &s;tanding directly under a rocky fell; there are not in it above a dozen good|looking hou&s;es, the re&s;t are old and low, with little wooden porticos in front. My inn plea&s;ed me much, (though &s;mall) for the neatne&s;s and civility of the good woman that kept it; &s;o I lay there two nights, and went,</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 13. To vi&s;it Gordale-&s;car, which lay &s;ix miles from Settle; but that way was directly over a fell, and as the wea|ther was not to be depended on, I went round in a chai&s;e, the only way one could get near it in a carriage, which made it full
<PB N="375" REF="378">
thirteen miles, half of it &s;uch a road! but I got &s;afe over it, &s;o there's an end, and came to Malham, (pronounced Maum) a village in the bo&s;om of the mountains, &s;eated in a wild and dreary valley. From thence I was to walk a mile over very rough ground, a torrent rattling along on the left hand; on the cliffs above hung a few goats; one of them danced and &s;cratched an ear with its hind foot in a place where I would not have &s;tood &s;tock-&s;till
<Q><L>For all beneath the moon.</L></Q>
As I advanced, the crags &s;eemed to clo&s;e in, but di&s;covered a narrow entrance turning to the left between them: I followed my guide a few paces, and the hills opened again into no large &s;pace; and then all farther way is barred by a &s;tream that, at the height of about fifty feet, gu&s;hes from a hole in the rock, and &s;preading in large &s;heets over its broken front, da&s;hes from &s;teep to &s;teep, and then rattles away in a torrent down the valley: the rock on the left ri&s;es perpendicular, with &s;tub|bed yew-trees and &s;hrubs &s;taring from its &s;ide, to the height of at lea&s;t 300 feet; but the&s;e are not the thing: it is the rock to the right, under which you &s;tand to &s;ee the fall, that forms the principal horror of the place. From its very ba&s;e it begins to &s;lope forwards over you in one block or &s;olid ma&s;s without any crevice in its &s;urface, and over&s;hadows half the area below with its dreadful canopy; when I &s;tood at (I believe) four yards di&s;tance from its foot, the drops, which perpetually di&s;til from its brow, fell on my head; and in one part of its top, more expo&s;ed to the weather, there are loo&s;e &s;tones that hang in air, and threaten vi&s;ibly &s;ome idle &s;pectator with in&s;tant de&s;truction; it is &s;afer to &s;helter your&s;elf clo&s;e to its bottom, and tru&s;t to the mercy of that enormous ma&s;s which nothing but an earthquake
<PB N="376" REF="379">
can &s;tir. The gloomy uncomfortable day well &s;uited the &s;avage a&s;pect of the place, and made it &s;till more formidable: I &s;tayed there, not without &s;huddering, a quarter of an hour, and thought my trouble richly paid; for the impre&s;&s;ion will la&s;t for life. At the alehou&s;e where I dined in Malham, Vivares, the land&s;cape-painter, had lodged for a week or more; Smith and Bellers had al&s;o been there, and two prints of Gordale have been engraved by them.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 14. Leaving my comfortable inn, to which I had re|turned from Gordale, I &s;et out for Skipton, &s;ixteen miles. From &s;everal parts of the road, and in many places about Settle, I &s;aw at once the three famous hills of this country, Ingleborough, Penigent, and Pendle; the fir&s;t is e&s;teemed the highe&s;t, and their features not to be de&s;cribed, but by the pencil.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Without the pencil nothing indeed is to be de&s;cribed with preci&s;ion; and even then that pencil ought to be in the very hand of the writer, ready to &s;upply with outlines every thing that his pen cannot expre&s;s by words. As far as language can de&s;cribe, Mr. Gray has, I think, pu&s;hed its powers: For rejecting, as I before hinted, every general unmeaning and hyperbolical phra&s;e, he has &s;elected (both in this journal, and on other &s;imilar occa&s;ions) the plaine&s;t, &s;imple&s;t, and mo&s;t direct terms: yet notwith&s;tanding his judicious care, in the u&s;e of the&s;e, I mu&s;t own I feel them defective. They pre&s;ent me, it is true, with a picture of the &s;ame &s;pecies, but not with the identical picture: my imagination receives clear and di&s;tinct, but not true and exact images. It may be a&s;ked then, why am I entertained by well-written de&s;criptions? I an&s;wer, becau&s;e they amu&s;e rather than inform me; and becau&s;e, after I have &s;een the places de&s;cribed, they &s;erve to recal to my memory the original &s;cene, almo&s;t as well as the true&s;t drawing or picture. In the meanwhile, my mind is flattered by thinking it has acquired &s;ome conception of the place, and re&s;ts contented in an innocent error, which nothing but ocular proof can detect, and which, when detected, does not dimini&s;h the plea&s;ure I had before received, but augments it by &s;uper|adding the charms of compari&s;on and verification; and herein I would place the real and only merit of verbal pro&s;e de&s;cription. To &s;peak of poetical, would lead me beyond the limits as well as the purpo&s;e of this note. I cannot, however, help adding, that I have &s;een one piece of verbal de&s;cription which compleatly &s;atisfies me, becau&s;e it is throughout a&s;&s;i&s;ted by ma&s;terly delineation. It is com|po&s;ed by the Rev. Mr. Gilpin, of Cheam in Surry; and contains, among&s;t other places, an account of the very &s;cenes which, in this tour, our author vi&s;ited. This Gentleman, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the conjoined talent of a writer and a de&s;igner, has em|ployed them in this manu&s;cript to every purpo&s;e of picture&s;que beauty, in the de&s;cription of which a correct eye, a practi&s;ed pencil, and an eloquent pen could a&s;&s;i&s;t him. He has, con&s;equently, produced a work <HI>unique</HI> in its kind at once. But I have &s;aid it is in manu&s;cript, and, I am afraid, likely to continue &s;o; for would his mode&s;ty permit him to print it, the great expence of plates would make its publication almo&s;t impracticable.</NOTE></P>

Craven, after all, is an unplea&s;ing country when &s;een from a height; its valleys are chiefly wide, and either mar&s;hy or in|clo&s;ed pa&s;ture, with a few trees. Numbers of black cattle are fatted here, both of the Scotch breed, and a larger &s;ort of oxen with great horns. There is little cultivated ground, except a few oats.</P>
<P>Skipton, to which I went through Long-Pre&s;ton and Gar|grave, is a pretty large market-town, in a valley, with one very broad &s;treet gently &s;loping downwards from the ca&s;tle, which &s;tands at the head of it. This is one of our good Counte&s;s's buildings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anne Counte&s;s of Pembroke and Montgomery.</NOTE>, but on old foundations; it is not very large, but of a hand&s;ome antique appearance, with round towers, a grand gateway, bridge, and moat, &s;urrounded by many old trees. It is in good repair, and kept up as a habitation of the Earl of Thanet, though he rarely comes thither: what

with the &s;leet, and a fooli&s;h di&s;pute about chai&s;es, that delayed me, I did not &s;ee the in&s;ide of it, but went on, fifteen miles, to Otley; fir&s;t up Shode-bank, the &s;teepe&s;t hill I ever &s;aw a road carried over in England, for it mounts in a &s;trait line (without any other repo&s;e for the hor&s;es than by placing &s;tones every now and then behind the wheels) for a full mile; then the road goes on a level along the brow of this high hill over Rumbald-moor, till it gently de&s;cends into Wharldale, &s;o they call the vale of the Wharf, and a beautiful vale it is, well-wooded, well-culti|vated, well-inhabited, but with high crags at a di&s;tance, that border the green country on either hand; thro' the mid&s;t of it, deep, clear, full to the brink, and of no incon&s;iderable breadth, runs in long windings the river. How it comes to pa&s;s that it &s;hould be &s;o fine and copious a &s;tream here, and at Tadca&s;ter (&s;o much lower) &s;hould have nothing but a wide &s;tony channel without water, I cannot tell you. I pa&s;&s;ed through Long|Addingham, Ilkeley (pronounced Eecly) di&s;tingui&s;hed by a lofty brow of loo&s;e rocks to the right; Burley, a neat and pretty village among trees; on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river lay Mid|dleton-Lodge, belonging to a catholic gentleman of that name; We&s;ton, a venerable &s;tone fabric, with large offices, of Mr. Vava&s;our, the meadows in front gently de&s;cending to the water, and behind a great and &s;hady wood; Farnley (Mr. Fawkes's) a place like the la&s;t, but larger, and ri&s;ing higher on the &s;ide of the hill. Otley is a large airy town, with clean but low ru&s;|tic buildings, and a bridge over the Wharf; I went into its &s;pacious Gothic church, which has been new-roofed, with a flat &s;tucco-ceiling; in a corner of it is the monument of Tho|mas Lord Fairfax, and Helen A&s;ke, his Lady, de&s;cended from the Cliffords and Latimers, as her epitaph &s;ays; the figures, not

<P>I Have utterly forgot where my Journal left off, but I think it was after the account of Gordale near Settle; if &s;o, there was little more worth your notice: the principal things were Wharldale, in the way from Skipton to Otley, and Kir&s;tall abbey, three miles from Leeds ****<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Here a paragraph, de&s;cribing Wharldale in the foregoing Journal, was re|peated.</NOTE>. Kir&s;tall is a noble ruin in the Semi-&s;axon &s;tyle of building, as old as King Stephen, towards the end of his reign, 1152. The whole church is &s;till &s;tanding, the roof excepted, &s;eated in a delicious quiet valley, on the banks of the river Aire, and pre&s;erved with religious reve|rence by the Duke of Montagu. Adjoining to the church, be|tween that and the river, are variety of chapels and remnants of the abbey, &s;hattered by the encroachments of the ivy, and &s;ur|rounded by many a &s;turdy tree, who&s;e twi&s;ted roots break thro' the fret of the vaulting, and hang &s;treaming from the roofs. The gloom of the&s;e antient cells, the &s;hade and verdure of the land&s;cape, the glittering and murmur of the &s;tream, the lofty towers and long per&s;pectives of the church, in the mid&s;t of a clear bright day, detained me for many hours; and were the
<PB N="380" REF="383">
true&s;t objects for my gla&s;s I have yet met with any where. As I lay at that &s;moky, ugly, bu&s;y town of Leeds, I dropped all further thoughts of my Journal; and after pa&s;&s;ing two days at Ma&s;on's (tho' he was ab&s;ent) pur&s;ued my way by Nottingham, Leice&s;ter, Harborough, Kettering, Thrap&s;ton, and Huntingdon to Cambridge, where I arrived on the 22d of October, having met with no rain to &s;ignify till this la&s;t day of my journey. There's luck for you!</P>
<P>I do think of &s;eeing Wales this &s;ummer, having never found my &s;pirits lower than at pre&s;ent, and feeling that motion and change of the &s;cene is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to me; I will make A&s;ton in my way to Che&s;ter, and &s;hall rejoice to meet you there the la&s;t week in May.

<HEAD>Mr. GRAY to Mr. NICHOLLS.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter was written the 19th of November, 1764; but as it delineates another abbey, in a different manner, it &s;eems to make no improper companion to that which precedes it.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>I Received your letter at Southampton; and as I would wi&s;h to treat every body, according to their own rule and mea|&s;ure of good breeding, have, again&s;t my inclination, waited till now before I an&s;wered it, purely out of fear and re&s;pect, and an ingenuous diffidence of my own abilities. If you will

not take this as an excu&s;e, accept it at lea&s;t as a well-turned period, which is always my principal concern.</P>
<P>So I proceed to tell you that my health is much improved by the &s;ea, not that I drank it, or bathed in it, as the common people do: no! I only walked by it and looked upon it. The climate is remarkably mild, even in October and November; no &s;now has been &s;een to lie there for the&s;e thirty years pa&s;t; the myrtles grow in the ground again&s;t the hou&s;es, and Guern&s;ey lilies bloom in every window: the town, clean and well built, &s;urrounded by its old &s;tone walls, with their towers and gate|ways, &s;tands at the point of a penin&s;ula, and opens full &s;outh to an arm of the &s;ea, which, having formed two beautiful bays on each hand of it, &s;tretches away in direct view, till it joins the Briti&s;h Channel; it is &s;kirted on either &s;ide with gently-ri&s;ing grounds, cloathed with thick wood, and directly cro&s;s its mouth ri&s;e the high lands of the I&s;le of Wight at di&s;tance, but di&s;tinct|ly &s;een. In the bo&s;om of the woods (concealed from prophane eyes) lie hid the ruins of Nettely abbey; there may be richer and greater hou&s;es of religion, but the Abbot is content with his &s;ituation. See there, at the top of that hanging meadow, under the &s;hade of tho&s;e old trees that bend into a half circle about it, he is walking &s;lowly (good man!) and bidding his beads for the &s;ouls of his benefactors, interred in that venerable pile that lies beneath him. Beyond it (the meadow &s;till de&s;cending) nods a thicket of oaks that ma&s;k the building, and have exclu|ded a view too gari&s;h and luxuriant for a holy eye; only on either hand they leave an opening to the blue glittering &s;ea. Did you not ob&s;erve how, as that white &s;ail &s;hot by and was lo&s;t, he turned and cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to drive the tempter from

I &s;hould tell you that the ferryman who rowed me, a lu&s;ty young fellow, told me that he would not for all the world pa&s;s a night at the abbey (there were &s;uch things &s;een near it) though there was a power of money hid there.

<P>I Rejoice to hear that you are re&s;tored to better &s;tate of health, to your books, and to your mu&s;e once again. That forced di&s;&s;ipation and exerci&s;e we are obliged to fly to as a remedy, when this frail machine goes wrong, is often almo&s;t as bad as the di&s;temper we would cure; yet I too have been con&s;trained of late to pur&s;ue a like regimen, on account of certain pains in the head, (a &s;en&s;ation unknown to me before) and of great de|jection of &s;pirits. This, Sir, is the only excu&s;e I have to make you for my long &s;ilence, and not (as perhaps you may have figured to your&s;elf) any &s;ecret reluctance I had to tell you my mind concerning the &s;pecimen you &s;o kindly &s;ent me of your new Poem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This letter was written in an&s;wer to one that inclo&s;ed only a part of the fir&s;t book of the Min&s;trel in manu&s;cript, and I believe a &s;ketch of Mr. Beattie's plan for the whole.</NOTE>: On the contrary, if I had &s;een any thing of im|portance to di&s;approve, I &s;hould have ha&s;tened to inform you, and never doubted of being forgiven. The truth is, I greatly like all I have &s;een, and wi&s;h to &s;ee more. The de&s;ign is &s;imple, and pregnant with poetical ideas of various kinds, yet &s;eems &s;omehow imperfect at the end. Why may not young Edwin, when nece&s;&s;ity has driven him to take up the harp, and a&s;&s;ume the profe&s;&s;ion of a Min&s;trel, do &s;ome great and &s;ingular &s;ervice to his country? (what &s;ervice I mu&s;t leave to your invention) &s;uch as no General, no State&s;man, no Morali&s;t could do with|out

the aid of mu&s;ic, in&s;piration, and poetry. This will not appear an improbability in tho&s;e early times, and in a character then held &s;acred, and re&s;pected by all nations: Be&s;ides, it will be a full an&s;wer to all the Hermit has &s;aid, when he di&s;&s;uaded him from cultivating the&s;e plea&s;ing arts; it will &s;hew their u&s;e, and make the be&s;t panegyrick of our favourite and cele&s;|tial &s;cience.

<P>I Was willing to go through the eight volumes of Count Al|garotti's works, which you lately pre&s;ented to the library of this College, before I returned you an an&s;wer: this mu&s;t be my excu&s;e to you for my &s;ilence. Fir&s;t I condole with you, that &s;o neat an edition &s;hould &s;warm in almo&s;t every page with errors of the pre&s;s, not only in notes and citations from Greek, Engli&s;h, and French authors, but in the Italian text it&s;elf, greatly to the di&s;reputation of the Leghorn publi&s;hers. This is the only rea|&s;on, I think, that could make an edition in England nece&s;&s;ary; but, I doubt, you would not find the matter much mended here; our pre&s;&s;es, as they improve in beauty, declining daily in accuracy; be&s;ides, you would find the expence very con&s;iderable, and the &s;ale in no proportion to it, as, in reality, it is but few people in England that read currently and with plea&s;ure the Italian tongue, and the fine old editions of their capital writers are &s;old at London for a lower price than they bear in Italy. An Engli&s;h tran&s;lation I can by no means advi&s;e; the ju&s;tne&s;s of thought and good &s;en&s;e might remain, but the graces of elocu|tion (which make a great part of Algarotti's merit) would be entirely lo&s;t, and that merely from the very different genius and complexion of the two languages.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s there can be no impropriety in your making the &s;ame pre&s;ent to the Univer&s;ity that you have done to your own

College. You need not at all to fear for the reputation of your friend, he has merit enough to recommend him in any country. A tincture of various &s;orts of knowledge, an acquaintance with all the beautiful arts, an ea&s;y command, a preci&s;ion, warmth, and richne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, and a judgment that is rarely mi&s;ta|ken on any &s;ubject to which he applies it. I had read the <HI>Con|gre&s;&s;o di Cit&eacute;ra</HI> before, and was exce&s;&s;ively plea&s;ed with it, in &s;pite of prejudice; for I am naturally no friend to allegory, nor to poetical pro&s;e. <Q REND="inline">"The <HI>Giudicio d'Amore</HI>"</Q> is an addition rather inferior to it. What gives me the lea&s;t plea&s;ure of any of his writings is the <HI>Newtoniani&s;m;</HI> it is &s;o direct an imitation of Fontenelle, a writer not ea&s;y to imitate, and lea&s;t of all in the Italian tongue, who&s;e character and graces are of a higher &s;tyle, and never adapt them&s;elves ea&s;ily to the elegant <HI>badinage</HI> and <HI>legeret&eacute;</HI> of conver&s;ation that &s;it &s;o well on the French. The e&s;&s;ays and letters (many of them entirely new to me) <HI>on the Arts,</HI> are curious and entertaining: Tho&s;e on other &s;ubjects, (even where the thoughts are not new, but borrowed from his various reading and conver&s;ation) often better put, and better expre&s;&s;ed than in the originals. I rejoice when I &s;ee Machiavel defended or illu&s;trated, who to me appears one of the wi&s;e&s;t men that any nation in any age has produced. Mo&s;t of the other di&s;cour&s;es, military or political, are well worth reading, though that on Kouli-Khan was a mere jeu d'e&s;prit, a &s;ort of hi&s;torical exerci&s;e. The letters from Ru&s;&s;ia I had read before with plea&s;ure, particularly the narrative of Munick and La&s;cy's campaigns. The detached thoughts are often new and ju&s;t; but there &s;hould have been a revi&s;al of them, as they are frequently to be found in his letters repeated in the very &s;ame words.

You may think this is obvious, and (what you call) a trite ob&s;ervation. You are a green go&s;ling!

The very principal light and capital feature of my journey was the river Wye, which I de&s;cended in a boat for near forty miles from Ro&s;s to Chep&s;tow. Its banks are a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of namele&s;s beauties; one out of many you may &s;ee not ill de&s;cribed by Mr. Whately, in his Ob&s;ervations on Gardening, under the name of the New-Weir: he has al&s;o touched upon two others, Tinterne Abbey and Persfield, both of them famous &s;cenes, and both on the Wye. Monmouth, a town I never heard mentioned, lies on the &s;ame river, in a vale that is the delight of my eyes, and the very &s;eat of plea&s;ure. The vale of Aber|gavenny,

Ragland, and Chep&s;tow ca&s;tles; Ludlow, Malvern|hills, Hampton-Court, near Lem&s;ter; the Lea&s;ows, Hagley, the three cities and their cathedrals; and la&s;tly Oxford (where I pa&s;&s;ed two days on my return with great &s;atisfaction) were the re&s;t of my acqui&s;itions, and no bad harve&s;t in my opinion; but I made no journal my&s;elf, el&s;e you &s;hould have had it: I have indeed a &s;hort one written by the companion of my travels<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Nicholls.</NOTE>, that &s;erves to recal and fix the fleeting images of the&s;e things.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This is the la&s;t Letter which I have &s;elected for this Section; and I in&s;ert it chiefly for the occa&s;ion which it affords me of commenting on the latter part of it, where he &s;peaks of his own employment as Profe&s;&s;or of Modern Hi&s;tory; an office which he had now held nearly three years, and had not begun to execute the duties of it. His health, which was all the time gradually on the decline, and his &s;pirits only &s;upported by the frequent &s;ummer excur&s;ions, during this period, might, to the candid reader, be a &s;ufficient apology for this omi&s;&s;ion, or rather procra&s;tination: but there is more to be &s;aid in his excu&s;e; and
<PB N="396" REF="399">
I &s;hould ill execute the office I have undertaken of arranging the&s;e papers, with a view of doing honour to his memory, if I did not endeavour to remove every exception that might, with a &s;how of rea&s;on, be taken to his conduct in this in&s;tance.</P>
<P>His bu&s;ine&s;s, as Profe&s;&s;or, con&s;i&s;ted of two parts; one, the teaching of modern Languages; the other, the reading of lectures on Modern Hi&s;tory. The patent which created the office, au|thorized him to execute the former of the&s;e by deputies; the latter, the &s;ame patent pre&s;cribed to him, to commence by reading a public lecture in the &s;chools, and to continue to do &s;o once at lea&s;t in every term. As this patent did not a&s;certain the language in which the lecture was to be read, he was at li|berty to do it either in Latin or Engli&s;h; he cho&s;e the former, and I think rather injudiciou&s;ly; becau&s;e, tho' no man, in the earlier part of his life, was more ready in Latin compo&s;ition, he had now lo&s;t the habit, and might therefore well have excu&s;ed him|&s;elf, by the nature of his &s;ubject, from any &s;uperadded diffi|culty of language. However, immediately on his appointment, he &s;ketched out an admirable plan for his inauguration &s;peech; in which, after enumerating the preparatory and auxiliary &s;tu|dies requi&s;ite, &s;uch as Antient Hi&s;tory, Georgraphy, Chrono|logy, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among&s;t the&s;e auxiliaries, he has &s;et down <HI>Memoria Tecnica;</HI> an art in which he had much exerci&s;ed him&s;elf when young. I find many memorial ver&s;es among his &s;cattered papers: and I &s;u&s;pect he found good account in the practice; for few men were more ready and accurate in their dates of events than our Author.</NOTE> he de&s;cended to the authentic &s;ources of the &s;cience, &s;uch as Public Treaties&mdash;State Records&mdash;Private Corre&s;pondence of Amba&s;&s;adors, &amp;c. He al&s;o wrote the Exordium of this The|&s;is;
<PB N="397" REF="400">
not indeed in a manner correct enough to be here given by way of Fragment: but &s;o &s;pirited, in point of &s;entiment, as leaves it much to be lamented, that he did not proceed to its com|pletion. At the &s;ame time he drew up, and laid before the Duke of Grafton, ju&s;t then cho&s;en Chancellor of the Univer&s;ity, three different &s;chemes for regulating the method of choo&s;ing pupils privately to be in&s;tructed by him: one of the&s;e was &s;o much approved as to be &s;ent to Oxford, in order to be ob&s;erved by the new Profe&s;&s;or then appointed in that place: and the &s;ame plan, or &s;omething very &s;imilar to it, regulates the private lec|tures which Mr. Gray's &s;ucce&s;&s;or now reads at Cambridge; but the public ones, I believe, are &s;till omitted in both Univer&s;ities: and yet I conceive, that on the&s;e (had Mr. Gray been appointed earlier in life to the office) he would have cho&s;en chiefly to ex|ert his uncommon abilities. Indeed, if we con&s;ider the nature of the &s;tudy it&s;elf, Modern Hi&s;tory, &s;o far as it is a detail of facts, (and &s;o far only, a boy ju&s;t come from &s;chool can be &s;up|po&s;ed to be taught it) may be as compleatly learned from private reading as from the mouth of any lecturer whatever. What can his lecture con&s;i&s;t of, if it aims to teach what it ought, but a chain of well-authenticated events, judiciou&s;ly &s;elected from the numerous writers on the &s;ubject? What can it then be more than an abridgment added to the innumerable ones with which our libraries are already crouded? I know of no difficult propo&s;itions which this &s;tudy contains, to the proof of which the pupil mu&s;t be led &s;tep after &s;tep by the &s;low hand of demon&s;tration; or that require to be elucidated by the conviction of a mechanical experiment. On this &s;ubject carefully to read, is compleatly to under&s;tand; it is the exerci&s;e of memory, not of rea&s;on. But a public Lecturer, reading to an audience well
<PB N="398" REF="401">
in&s;tructed in the&s;e facts, has a wider and nobler field. It is his province to trace every important event to its political &s;pring; to develope the cau&s;e, and thence deduce the con&s;equence. In the cour&s;e of &s;uch di&s;qui&s;itions, the rational faculties of his auditors are employed in weighing the force of his arguments, and their judgments finally convinced by the deci&s;ive &s;trength of them. What would be an idle di&s;play of either logic or rhetoric, where youths are only to be initiated into the know|ledge of facts, becomes before this circle of mature hearers, a nece&s;&s;ary exertion of erudition and genius. From &s;uch lectures, afterwards collected into a volume, not only the Univer&s;ity but the nation it&s;elf, nay all other nations might reap their advan|tage; and receive from this, the benefit they have received from other &s;imilar in&s;titutions: For though Mr. Gray, in one of the plans lately mentioned, ob&s;erves, that <Q REND="inline">"Lectures read in public are generally things of more o&s;tentation than u&s;e; yet" (he adds) "if indeed they &s;hould gradually &s;well into a book, and the Author &s;hould find rea&s;on to hope they might de&s;erve the attention of the publick, it is po&s;&s;ible they might become of general &s;ervice; of this we have already &s;ome in&s;tances, as Judge Black&s;tone's Lectures on the Common Law, and the Bi&s;hop of Oxford's on Hebrew Poetry."</Q></P>
<P>But the&s;e reflections lead me beyond my purpo&s;e, which was only to remove from my decea&s;ed friend any imputation which, on this account, might re&s;t on his memory. Certain it is, that notwith&s;tanding his ill health, he con&s;tantly intended to read lectures; and I remember the la&s;t time he vi&s;ited me at A&s;ton, in the &s;ummer of the year 1770, he expre&s;&s;ed much chagrin on this &s;ubject, and even declared it to be his &s;tedfa&s;t re&s;olution
<PB N="399" REF="402">
to re&s;ign his Profe&s;&s;or&s;hip, if he found him&s;elf unable to do real &s;ervice in it. What I &s;aid to di&s;&s;uade him from this, tho' I urged, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, every argument I could think of, had, I found, &s;o little weight with him, that I am almo&s;t per|&s;uaded he would very &s;oon have put this intention into execu|tion. But death prevented the trial; the particulars of which it is now my melancholy office to relate.</P>
<P>The Gout, which he always believed hereditary in his con|&s;titution, (for both his parents died of that di&s;temper) had for &s;everal years attacked him in a weakly and unfixed manner; and the great temperance which he ob&s;erved, particularly in regard to his drinking, &s;erved, perhaps, to prevent any &s;evere paroxi&s;m, but by no means eradicated the con&s;titutional malady. In the latter end of May, 1771, ju&s;t about the time he wrote the la&s;t letter, he removed to London, where he became feveri&s;h, and his dejection of &s;pirits increa&s;ed: the weather being then very &s;ultry, our common friend, Dr. Gi&s;borne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phy&s;ician to his Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;hold.</NOTE>, advi&s;ed him, for an opener and freer air, to remove from his lodgings in Jermyn|&s;treet to Ken&s;ington, where he frequently attended him, and where Mr. Gray &s;o far got the better of his di&s;order, as to be able to return to Cambridge; meaning from thence to &s;et out very &s;oon for Old Park, in hopes that travelling, from which he u&s;ually received &s;o much benefit, would compleat his cure: but on the 24th of July, while at dinner in the College Hall, he felt a &s;udden nau&s;ea, which obliged him to ri&s;e from table and retire to his chamber. This continued to increa&s;e, and nothing &s;taying on his &s;tomach, he &s;ent for his friend Dr. Glynn, who finding it to be the gout in that part, thought his ca&s;e dangerous,
<PB N="400" REF="403">
and called in Dr. Plumptree, the Phy&s;ical Profe&s;&s;or: they pre|&s;cribed to him the u&s;ual cordials given in that di&s;temper, but without any good effect; for on the 29th he was &s;eized with a &s;trong convul&s;ion fit, which, on the 30th, returned with in|crea&s;ed violence, and on the next evening he expired. He was &s;en&s;ible at times almo&s;t to the la&s;t, and from the fir&s;t aware of his extreme danger; but expre&s;&s;ed no vi&s;ible concern at the thoughts of his approaching di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>This account I draw up from the letters which Dr. Brown, then on the &s;pot, wrote to me during his &s;hort illne&s;s; and as I felt &s;trongly at the time what Tacitus has &s;o well expre&s;&s;ed on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, I may, with propriety, u&s;e his words: <Q REND="inline">"Mihi, praeter acerbitatem amici erepti, auget mae&s;titiam, quod ad&s;idere valetudini, fovere deficientem, &s;atiari vultu, complexu, non contigit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Vita Agricolae, cap. xlv.</BIBL></NOTE>."</Q> I was then on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of York&s;hire, at a di&s;tance from the direct po&s;t, and therefore did not receive the melancholy intelligence &s;oon enough to be able to reach Cambridge before his corp&s;e had been carried to the place he had, by will, appointed for its interment. To &s;ee the la&s;t rites duly performed, therefore, fell to the lot of Dr. Brown; I had only to join him, on his return from the funeral, in executing the other tru&s;ts which his friend&s;hip had authorized us jointly to perform.</P>
<P>The method in which I have arranged the foregoing pages, has, I tru&s;t, one degree of merit, that it makes the reader &s;o well acquainted with the man him&s;elf, as to render it totally unnece&s;&s;ary to conclude the whole with his character. If I am mi&s;taken in this point, I have been a compiler to little
<PB N="401" REF="404">
purpo&s;e; and I cho&s;e to be this rather than a biographer, that I might do the more ju&s;tice to the virtues and genius of my friend. I might have written his life in the common form, perhaps with more reputation to my&s;elf; but, &s;urely, not with equal information to the reader; for who&s;e &s;ake I have never related a &s;ingle circum&s;tance of Mr. Gray's life in my own words, when I could employ <HI>his</HI> for the purpo&s;e. Fortunately I had more materials for this u&s;e, than commonly fall to the lot of an Editor; and I certainly have not been &s;paring in the u&s;e of them: whether I have been too lavi&s;h, mu&s;t be left to the deci&s;ion of the public.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the Latin Poems, which I have printed in the three fir&s;t Sections of the&s;e Memoirs, I mu&s;t beg leave to add one word here, though a little out of place. A learned and ingenious per&s;on, to whom I communicated them, after they were printed off, was of opinion, that they contain &s;ome few expre&s;&s;ions not warranted by any good authority; and that there are one or two fal&s;e quantities to be found in them. I once had an intention to cancel the pages, and correct the pa&s;&s;ages objected to, according to my friend's critici&s;ms; but, on &s;econd thoughts, I deemed it be&s;t to let them &s;tand exactly as I found them in the manu&s;cripts. The accurate cla&s;&s;ical reader will perhaps be be&s;t plea&s;ed with finding out the faulty pa&s;&s;ages him&s;elf; and his candour will ea&s;ily make the proper allowances for any little mi&s;takes in ver&s;es, which he will con|&s;ider never had the author's la&s;t hand.</P>
<P>I might here lay down my pen, yet if any reader &s;hould &s;till want his character, I will give him one which was publi&s;hed very

It appears to be well written; and, as it comes from an anonymous pen, I chu&s;e the rather to in&s;ert it, as it will, on that account, be le&s;s &s;u&s;pected of parti|ality.</P>

I have &s;ince been favoured with a Letter from a Gentleman, well &s;killed in that &s;cience, who after carefully peru&s;ing his interleaved Sy&s;tema Naturae of Linnaeus, gives me this character of it: <Q REND="inline">"In the cla&s;s of animals (the Mammalia) he has concentrated (if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion) what the old writers and the diffu&s;e Buffon have &s;aid upon the &s;ubject; he was univer&s;ally adapted the conci&s;e language of Linnaeus, and has given it an elegance which the Swede had no idea of; but there is little of his own in this cla&s;s, and it &s;erved him only as a common-place; but it is &s;uch a common-place that few men but Mr. Gray could form. In the birds and fi&s;hes he has mo&s;t accurately de&s;cribed all that he had an opportunity of examining: but the volume of in&s;ects is the mo&s;t perfect; on the Engli&s;h in&s;ects there is certainly nothing &s;o perfect. In regard to the plants, there is little el&s;e than the Engli&s;h names and their native &s;oils extracted from the Species Plantarum of Linnaeus. I &s;uppo&s;e no man was &s;o complete a ma&s;ter of his &s;y&s;tem; he has &s;e|lected the di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of each animal, &amp;c. with the greate&s;t judgment, and, what no man el&s;e probably could have done, he has made the German La|tin of Linnaeus purely cla&s;&s;ical."</Q></NOTE> and civil; had read all the original hi&s;torians of England, France, and Italy; and was a great antiquarian.

With &s;uch a fund of knowledge, his conver&s;ation mu&s;t have been equally in&s;tructing and entertaining; but he was al&s;o a good man, a well-bred man, a man of virtue and humanity.

He al&s;o had in &s;ome degree that weakne&s;s which di&s;gu&s;ted Voltaire &s;o much in Mr. Congreve<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I have often thought that Mr. Congreve might very well be vindicated on this head. It &s;eldom happens that the vanity of author&s;hip continues to the end of a man's days, it u&s;ually &s;oon leaves him where it found him; and if he has not &s;omething better to build his &s;elf-approbation upon than that of being a popular writer, he generally finds him&s;elf ill at ea&s;e, if re&s;pected only on that account. Mr. Congreve was much advanced in years when the young French Poet paid him this vi&s;it; and, though a man of the world, he might now feel that indifference to literary fame which Mr. Gray, who always led a more retired and philo&s;ophic life, certainly felt much earlier. Both of them therefore might rea&s;onably, at times, expre&s;s &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t, if their quiet was intruded upon by per&s;ons who thought they flattered them by &s;uch intru&s;ion.</NOTE>: though he &s;eemed to value others, chiefly according to the progre&s;s they had made in knowledge<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It was not on account of their knowledge that he valued mankind.

merely as a man of letters; and though without birth; or fortune, or &s;tation, his de&s;ire was to be looked upon as a private independent Gentleman, who read for his amu&s;ement. Perhaps it may be &s;aid, What &s;ignifies &s;o much knowledge, when it produced &s;o little? Is it worth taking &s;o much pains to leave no memorial, but a few poems? But let it be con|&s;idered, that Mr. Gray was to others, at lea&s;t innocently em|ployed; to him&s;elf, certainly beneficially. His time pa&s;&s;ed agreeably; he was every day making &s;ome new acqui&s;ition in &s;cience; his mind was enlarged, his heart &s;oftened, his virtue &s;trengthened; the world and mankind were &s;hewn to him without a ma&s;k; and he was taught to con&s;ider every thing as trifling, and unworthy of the attention of a wi&s;e man, except the pur&s;uit of knowledge, and the practice of virtue, in that &s;tate wherein God hath placed us."</P></Q>

Curio&s;ity led him to follow them, till looking through an opening in the rocks he &s;aw twelve gigantic figures re&s;embling women: they were all employed about a loom; and as they wove, they &s;ung the following dreadful Song; which, when they had fini&s;hed, they tore the web into twelve pieces, and (each taking her portion) galloped Six to the North and as many to the South. The&s;e were the <HI>Valkyriur,</HI> female Divinities, Servants of <HI>Odin</HI> (or <HI>Woden</HI>) in the Gothic mythology. Their name &s;ignifies <HI>Chu&s;ers of the &s;lain.</HI> They were mounted on &s;wift hor&s;es, with drawn &s;words in their hands; and in the throng of battle &s;elected &s;uch as were de&s;tined to &s;laughter, and conducted them to <HI>Valkalla,</HI> the hall of <HI>Odin,</HI> or paradi&s;e of the Brave; where they attended the banquet, and &s;erved the departed Heroes with horns of mead and ale.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

<HEAD>ODE I.</HEAD>
<DIV4 TYPE="introduction">
<P>The original manu&s;cript title, which Mr. Gray gave to this Ode, was NOON|TIDE; probably he then meant to write two more, de&s;criptive of Morning and Evening. His unfini&s;hed Ode (vide p. 236 of the Memoirs) opens with a fine de&s;cription of the former: and his Elegy with as beautiful a picture of the latter, which perhaps he might, at that time, have meditated upon for the exordium of an Ode; but this is only conjecture. It may, however, be remarked, that the&s;e three capital de&s;criptions abound with ideas which affect the ear more than the eye; and therefore go beyond the powers of picture&s;que imitation.</P>

<P>1. This little piece, in which comic humour is &s;o happily blended with lyri|cal fancy, was written in point of time &s;ome years later than the fir&s;t, third, and fourth Odes. See Memoirs, p. 188; but as the author had printed it here in his own edition, I have not changed it. Mr. Walpole, &s;ince the death of Mr. Gray, has placed the China va&s;e in que&s;tion on a pede&s;tal at Strawberry-Hill, with the fir&s;t four lines of the Ode for its in|&s;cription.<Q><L>'Twas on <HI>this</HI> Va&s;e's lofty &s;ide, &amp;c.</L></Q></P>

<P>The many hard con&s;onants, which occur in this line, hurt the ear; Mr. Gray perceived it him&s;elf, but did not alter it, as the words them&s;elves were tho&s;e which be&s;t conveyed his idea, and therefore he did not chu&s;e to &s;acrifice &s;en&s;e to &s;ound.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>Had Mr. Gray compleated the fine lyrical fragment, which I have in&s;erted in the fourth &s;ection of the Memoirs, I &s;hould have introduced it into the text of his Poems, as the fifth and la&s;t of his mono&s;trophic Odes. In order to fulfil the promi&s;e which I made to my reader, (&s;ee p. 235) I &s;hall now reprint the piece with my own additions to it. I have already made my apology for the attempt; and therefore &s;hall only add, that although (as is u&s;ually done on &s;uch occa&s;ions) I print my &s;upplemental lines in the italic character, yet I am well aware that their inferiority would but too ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h them without any typographical a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

And I think my&s;elf happy, through the favour of Mr. How (who&s;e acquaintance with Count Algarotti has been mentioned, p. 302 of the Memoirs) to be permitted to preface my annotations on them, with a letter which that celebrated foreigner wrote to him on their &s;ubject.

<P>1. This highly-fini&s;hed Ode, which Mr. Gray entitled the Progre&s;s of Poetry, de&s;cribes its power and influence as well as progre&s;s, which his explanatory notes at the bottom of the page point out, and this with all the accuracy of metaphy&s;ical preci&s;ion, di&s;gui&s;ed under the appearance of Pindaric digre&s;&s;ion.

<P>This has been condemned as a fal&s;e thought, and more worthy of an Italian Poet than of Mr. Gray. Count Algarotti, we have found in his letter to Mr. How, prai&s;es it highly; but as he was an Italian Critic, his judgment, in this point, will not, perhaps by many, be thought to overbalance the ob|jection. The truth is, that this fiction of the cau&s;e of Milton's blindne&s;s is not beyond the bounds of poetical credibility, any more than the fiction which precedes it concerning the birth of Shake&s;pear; and therefore would be equally admi&s;&s;able, had it not the peculiar misfortune to encounter a fact too well known: on this account the judgment revolts again&s;t it.

&s;o lofty and unrivalled a de&s;cription will not atone for this acknowledged defect, in relation to matter of fact, all that the impartial critic can do, is to point out the rea&s;on, and to apologize for the Poet, who was nece&s;&s;itated by his &s;ubject to con&s;ider Milton only in his poetical capacity.</P>

<P>1. I promi&s;ed the reader, in the 237th page of the Memoirs, to give him, in this place, the original argument of this capital Ode, as its author had &s;et it down on one of the pages of his common-place book. It is as follows: <Q REND="inline">"The army of Edward I. as they march through a deep valley, are &s;ud|denly &s;topped by the appearance of a venerable figure &s;eated on the &s;ummit of an inacce&s;&s;ible rock, who, with a voice more than human, reproaches the King with all the mi&s;ery and de&s;olation which he had brought on his country; foretells the misfortunes of the Norman race, and with prophetic &s;pirit declares, that all his cruelty &s;hall never extingui&s;h the noble ardour of poetic genius in this i&s;land; and that men &s;hall never be wanting to celebrate true virtue and valour in immortal &s;trains, to expo&s;e vice and infamous plea&s;ure, and boldly cen&s;ure tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. His &s;ong ended, he precipitates him&s;elf from the mountain, and is &s;wallowed up by the river that rolls at its foot."</Q> Fine as the conclu&s;ion of this Ode is at pre&s;ent, I think it would have been &s;till finer, if he could have executed it according to this plan; but unhappily for his purpo&s;e, in&s;tances of Engli&s;h Poets were wanting. Spen&s;er had that enchanting flow of ver&s;e which was peculiarly calculated <HI>to celebrate Virtue and Valour;</HI> but he cho&s;e to celebrate them, not literally, but in allegory. Shake&s;pear, who had talents for every thing, was undoubtedly capable <HI>of expo&s;ing Vice and infamous Plea&s;ure;</HI> and the drama was a proper vehicle for his &s;atire: but we do not ever find that he profe&s;&s;edly made this his object; nay, we know that, in one inimitable character, he has &s;o contrived as to make vices of the wor&s;t kind, &s;uch as cowardice, drunkenne&s;s, di&s;hone&s;ty, and lewdne&s;s, not only laughable, but almo&s;t amiable; for with all the&s;e &s;ins on his head, who can help liking

Fal&s;taffe? Milton, of all our great Poets, was the only one <HI>who boldly cen&s;ured Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion:</HI> but he cho&s;e to deliver this cen&s;ure, not in poetry, but in pro&s;e. Dryden was a mere court para&s;ite to the mo&s;t in|famous of all courts. Pope, with all his laudable dete&s;tation of corruption and bribery, was a Tory; and Addi&s;on, though a Whig and a fine wri|ter, was unluckily not enough of a Poet for his purpo&s;e. On the&s;e con|&s;iderations Mr. Gray was nece&s;&s;itated to change his plan towards the conclu&s;ion: Hence we perceive, that in the la&s;t epode he prai&s;es Spen&s;er only <HI>for his allegory,</HI> Shake&s;pear <HI>for his powers of moving the pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> and Milton <HI>for his epic excellence.</HI> I remember the Ode lay unfini&s;hed by him for a year or two on this very account; and I hardly believe that it would ever have had his la&s;t hand but for the circum&s;tance of his hearing Parry play on the Welch Harp at a concert at Cambridge, (&s;ee Letter xxv. &s;ect. iv.) which he often declared in&s;pired him with the conclu&s;ion.</P>

<P>2. Mr. Smith, the Mu&s;ical Compo&s;er and worthy pupil of Mr. Handel, had once an idea of &s;etting this Ode, and of having it performed by way of &s;erenata or oratorio. A common friend of his and Mr. Gray's intere&s;ted him&s;elf much in this de&s;ign, and drew out a clear analy&s;is of the Ode, that Mr. Smith might more perfectly under&s;tand the Poet's meaning. He con|ver&s;ed al&s;o with Mr. Gray on the &s;ubject, who gave him an idea for the overture, and marked al&s;o &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the Ode in order to a&s;certain which &s;hould be recitative, which air, what kind of air, and how accom|panied. The de&s;ign was, however, not executed; and therefore I &s;hall only (in order to give the reader a ta&s;te of Mr. Gray's mu&s;ical feelings) in|&s;ert in this place what his &s;entiments were concerning the overture. <Q REND="inline">"It &s;hould be &s;o contrived as to be a proper introduction to the Ode; it might con&s;i&s;t of two movements, the fir&s;t de&s;criptive of the horror and confu&s;ion of battle, the la&s;t a march grave and maje&s;tic, but expre&s;&s;ing the exulta|tion and in&s;olent &s;ecurity of conque&s;t. This movement &s;hould be com|po&s;ed entirely of wind in&s;truments, except the kettle-drum heard at inter|vals. The <HI>da capo</HI> of it mu&s;t be &s;uddenly broke in upon, and put to &s;ilence by the clang of the harp in a tumultuous rapid movement, joined with the voice, all at once, and not u&s;hered in by any &s;ymphony. The harmony may be &s;trengthened by any other &s;tringed in&s;trument; but the harp &s;hould every where prevail, and form the continued running accom|panyment, &s;ubmitting it&s;elf to nothing but the voice."</Q></P>

The &s;ix lines before us convey, perhaps, the mo&s;t beautiful piece of imagery in the whole Ode, and were a wonderful improvement on tho&s;e which he fir&s;t wrote; which, though they would appear fine in an inferior Poet, are infinitely below tho&s;e which &s;upplanted them.

<P>This Stanza (as an ingenious friend remarks) has exceeding merit. It breathes in a le&s;&s;er compa&s;s, what the Ode breathes at large, the high &s;pirit of lyric Enthu&s;ia&s;m. The Tran&s;itions are &s;udden, and impetuous; the Language full of fire and force; and the Imagery carried, without impropriety, to the mo&s;t daring height. The manner of Richard's death by Famine exhibits &s;uch beauties of Per&s;onification, as only the riche&s;t and mo&s;t vivid Imagi|nation could &s;upply. From thence we are hurried, with the wilde&s;t rapidity, into the mid&s;t of Battle; and the epithet <HI>kindred</HI> places at once before our eyes all the peculiar horrours of civil War. Immediately, by a tran&s;ition mo&s;t &s;triking and unexpected, the Poet falls into a tender and pathetic Ad|dre&s;s; which, from the &s;entiments and al&s;o from the numbers, has all the melancholy flow, and breathes all the plaintive &s;oftne&s;s, of Elegy. Again the Scene changes; again the Bard ri&s;es into an allegorical de&s;cription of Carnage, to which the metre is admirably adapted: and the concluding Sentence of per&s;onal puni&s;hment on Edward is denounced with a Solemnity, that chills and terrifies.</P>

<P>15. I cannot quit this and the preceding Ode, without &s;aying a word or two of my own concerning the ob&s;curity which has been imputed to them, and the preference which, in con&s;equence, has been given to his Elegy. It &s;eems as if the per&s;ons, who hold this opinion, &s;uppo&s;e that every &s;pecies of Poetry ought to be equally clear and intelligible: than which po&s;ition no|thing can be more repugnant to the &s;everal &s;pecific natures of compo&s;ition, and to the practice of antient art. Not to take Pindar and his Odes for an example, (though what I am here defending were written profe&s;&s;edly in imi|tation of him) I would a&s;k, Are all the writings of Horace, his Epi&s;tles, Satires, and Odes equally per&s;picuous? Among&s;t his Odes, &s;eparately con|&s;idered, are there not remarkable differences of this very kind? Is the &s;pirit and meaning of that which begins, <Q REND="inline">"De&s;cende coelo, &amp; dic, age, tibi&acirc;", <BIBL>Ode 4. lib. 3.</BIBL></Q> &s;o readily comprehended as <Q REND="inline">"Per&s;icos odi, puer, apparatus," <BIBL>Ode 38. l. 1.</BIBL></Q> And is the latter a finer piece of lyrical compo&s;ition on that account? Is <Q REND="inline">"Integer vitae, &s;celeri&s;&abque; purus," <BIBL>Ode 22. l. 1.</BIBL></Q> &s;uperior to <Q REND="inline">"Pindarum qui&s;quis &s;tudet aemulari," <BIBL>Ode 2. l. 4.</BIBL></Q> becau&s;e it may be un|der&s;tood at the fir&s;t reading, and the latter not without much &s;tudy and reflec|tion? Now between the&s;e Odes, thus compared, there is &s;urely equal diffe|rence in point of per&s;picuity, as between the Progre&s;s of Poe&s;y, and the Pro&s;pect of Eton; the Ode on the Spring, and the Bard: But, &s;ay the&s;e objectors, <Q REND="inline">"The end of Poetry is univer&s;ally to plea&s;e. Ob&s;curity, by ta|king off from our plea&s;ure, de&s;troys that end."</Q> I will grant that, if the ob&s;curity be great, con&s;tant, and un&s;urmountable, this is certainly true; but if it be only found in particular pa&s;&s;ages, proceeding from the nature of the &s;ubject and the very genius of the compo&s;ition, it does not rob us of our plea&s;ure, but &s;uperadds a new one which ari&s;es from conquering a difficulty;
<PB N="97" REF="516">
and the plea&s;ure which accrues from a difficult pa&s;&s;age when well under&s;tood, provided the pa&s;&s;age it&s;elf be a fine one, is always more permanent than that which we di&s;cover at the fir&s;t glance. The lyric Mu&s;e, like other fine Ladies, requires to be courted, and retains her admirers the longer for not having yielded too readily to their &s;olicitations. This argument ending as it does in a &s;ort of &s;imile will, I am per&s;uaded, not only have its force with the intelligent readers (the &Sgr;&Ugr;&Ngr;&Egr;&Tgr;&Ogr;&Igr;), but al&s;o with the men of fa&s;hion; as to critics of a lower cla&s;s, it may be &s;ufficient to tran&s;cribe, for their improve|ment, an unfini&s;hed remark, or rather maxim, which I found among&s;t our Author's papers; and which he probably wrote on occa&s;ion of the common preference given to his Elegy. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>The Gout de Comparai&s;on</HI> (as Bruyere &s;tyles it) is the only ta&s;te of ordinary minds. They do not know the &s;pecific excellency either of an author or a compo&s;ition: for in&s;tance, they do not know that Tibullus &s;poke the language of Nature and Love; that Horace &s;aw the vanities and follies of mankind with the mo&s;t penetrating eye, and touched them to the quick; that Virgil ennobled even the mo&s;t com|mon images by the graces of a glowing, melodious, and well-adapted expre&s;&s;ion; but they do know that Virgil was a better poet than Horace; and that Horace's Epi&s;tles do not run &s;o well as the Elegies of Tibullus."</Q></P>

<P>This Ode, to which, on the title, I have given the epithet of IRREGULAR, is the only one of the kind which Mr. Gray ever wrote; and its being written occa&s;ionally, and for mu&s;ic, is a &s;ufficient apology for the defect. Exclu|&s;ive of this, (for a defect it certainly is) it appears to me, in point of lyrical arrangement and expre&s;&s;ion, to be equal to mo&s;t of his other Odes. It is remarkable that, among&s;t the many irregular Odes which have been written in our own language, Dryden's and Pope's, on St. Cecilia's Day, are the only ones that may properly be &s;aid to have lived. The rea&s;on is (as I have hinted in a note, p. 233 of the Memoirs) that this mode of compo&s;ition is &s;o extremely ea&s;y, that it gives the writer an opening to every kind of poetical licentiou&s;ne&s;s: whereas the regularly repeated &s;tanza, and &s;till more the regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;trophe, anti&s;trophe, and epode, put &s;o &s;trong a curb on the wayward imagination, that when &s;he has once paced in it,
<PB N="98" REF="517">
&s;he &s;eldom choo&s;es to &s;ubmit to it a &s;econd time. 'Tis therefore greatly to be wi&s;hed, in order to &s;tifle in their birth a quantity of compo&s;itions, which are at the &s;ame time wild and jejune, that regular Odes, and the&s;e only, &s;hould be deemed legitimate among&s;t us.</P>

<P>Women were looked upon by the Gothic nations as having a peculiar in&s;ight into futurity; and &s;ome there were that made profe&s;&s;ion of magic arts and divination. The&s;e travelled round the country, and were received in every hou&s;e with great re&s;pect and honour. Such a woman bore the name of Volva Seidkona or Spakona. The dre&s;s of Thorbiorga, one of the&s;e pro|phete&s;&s;es, is de&s;cribed at large in Eirick's Rauda Sogu, (apud Bartholin. lib. i. cap. iv. p. 688.) She had on a blue ve&s;t &s;pangled all over with &s;tones, a necklace of gla&s;s beads, and a cap made of the &s;kin of a black lamb lined with white cat-&s;kin. She leaned on a &s;taff adorned with bra&s;s, with a round head &s;et with &s;tones; and was girt with a Hunlandi&s;h belt, at which hung her pouch full of magical in&s;truments. Her bu&s;kins were of rough calf-&s;kin, bound on with thongs &s;tudded with knobs of bra&s;s, and her gloves of white cat-&s;kin, the fur turned inwards, &amp;c. G.</P>

<P>Whoever compares Mr. Gray's poetical ver&s;ions of the&s;e four lyrical pieces, with the literal tran&s;lations which I have here in&s;erted, will, I am per&s;uaded, be convinced that nothing of the kind was ever executed with more fire, and at the &s;ame time, more judgment. He keeps up through them all the wild romantic &s;pirit of his originals; elevates them by &s;ome well-cho&s;en epithet or image where they flag, yet in &s;uch a manner as is perfectly con|gruous with the general idea of the poems; and if he either varies or omits any of the original thoughts, they are only of that kind which, according to our modern &s;entiments, would appear vulgar or ludicrous: two in&s;tances of this kind occur in the latter part of this la&s;t Ode. How well has he turned the idea of the fourth line: <Q REND="inline">"Ex iis qui nimio potu madidi?"</Q> and the conclu&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"Aliter ad hoc Carmen compingendum, &amp;c."</Q> The former of which is ridiculous; the latter in&s;ipid.</P>

<P>This is as perfect in its kind as the foregoing Sonnet. Sir William Williams, in the expedition to Aix, was on board the Magnanime with Lord Howe, and was deputed to receive the capitulation.</P>

<HEAD>ELEGY, written in a Country Church-yard.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P>1. The mo&s;t popular of all our Author's publications; it ran through eleven editions in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time; was finely tran&s;lated into Latin by Me&s;&s;rs. An&s;ty and Roberts; and in the &s;ame year another, though I think inferior, ver&s;ion of it was publi&s;hed by Mr. Lloyd. The reader has been informed, in the Memoirs, of the time and manner of its fir&s;t publication. He originally gave it only the &s;imple title of <Q REND="inline">"Stanzas written in a Country Church-yard."</Q> I per&s;uaded him fir&s;t to call it an ELEGY, becau&s;e the &s;ub|ject authorized him &s;o to do; and the alternate mea&s;ure, in which it was written, &s;eemed peculiarly fit for that &s;pecies of compo&s;ition. I imagined too that &s;o capital a Poem, written in this mea&s;ure, would as it were ap|propriate it in future to writings of this &s;ort; and the number of imitations which have &s;ince been made of it (even to &s;atiety) &s;eem to prove that my notion was well founded. In the fir&s;t manu&s;cript copy of this exqui&s;ite Poem, I find the conclu&s;ion different from that which he afterwards compo|&s;ed; and tho' his after-thought was unque&s;tionably the be&s;t, yet there is a pathetic melancholy in the four rejected &s;tanzas, which highly claims pre|&s;ervation. I &s;hall therefore give them as a variation in their proper place.</P>

<L>And thou, who mindful of th' unhonour'd Dead,</L>
<L>Do&s;t in the&s;e notes their artle&s;s tale relate,</L>
<L>By night and lonely contemplation led</L>
<L>To wander in the gloomy walks of fate:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hark! how the &s;acred Calm, that breathes around,</L>
<L>Bids every fierce tumultuous pa&s;&s;ion cea&s;e;</L>
<L>In &s;till &s;mall accents whi&s;pering from the ground,</L>
<L>A grateful earne&s;t of eternal peace.</L>

<P>And here the Poem was originally intended to conclude, before the happy idea of the hoary-headed Swain, &amp;c. &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf to him. I cannot help hinting to the reader, that I think the third of the&s;e rejected &s;tanzas equal to any in the whole Elegy.</P>

<P>Thus it &s;tood in the fir&s;t and &s;ome following editions, and I think rather better; for the authority of Petrarch does not de&s;troy the appearance of quaintne&s;s in the other: the thought however is rather ob&s;curely expre&s;&s;ed in both readings. He means to &s;ay, in plain pro&s;e, that we wi&s;h to be remembered by our friends after our death, in the &s;ame manner as when alive we wi&s;hed to be remembered by them in our ab&s;ence: this would be expre&s;&s;ed clearer, if the metaphorical term <HI>fires</HI> was rejected, and the line ran thus:
<Q><L>Awake and faithful to her fir&s;t de&s;ires.</L></Q></P>
<P> I do not put this alteration down for the idle vanity of aiming to amend the pa&s;&s;age, but purely to explain it.</P>

<P>I rather wonder that he rejected this &s;tanza, as it not only has the &s;ame &s;ort of Doric delicacy, which charms us peculiarly in this part of the Poem, but al&s;o compleats the account of his whole day: whereas, this Evening &s;eene being omitted, we have only his Morning walk, and his Noon-tide repo&s;e.</P>
