<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. SPEAKER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you for pointing to me. I really wi&s;hed much to engage your attention in an early &s;tage of the debate. I have been long very deeply, though perhaps ineffectually, en|gaged in the preliminary enquiries, which have continued without intermi&s;&s;ion for &s;ome years. Though I have felt, with &s;ome degree of &s;en&s;ibility, the natural and inevitable impre&s;|&s;ions of the &s;everal matters of fact, as they have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively di&s;clo&s;ed, I have not at any time attempted to trouble you on the merits of the &s;ubject; and very little on any of the points which incidentally aro&s;e in the cour&s;e of our pro|ceedings. But I &s;hould be &s;orry to be found to|tally &s;ilent upon this day. Our enquiries are now come to their final i&s;&s;ue:&mdash;It is now to be deter|mined whether the three years of laborious par|liamentary re&s;earch, whether the twenty years
<PB N="2" REF="3">
of patient Indian &s;uffering, are to produce a &s;ub&s;tantial reform in our Ea&s;tern admini&s;tration; or whether our knowledge of the grievances has abated our zeal for the correction of them, and whether our very enquiry into the evil was only a pretext to elude the remedy which is demanded from us by humanity, by ju&s;tice, and by every principle of true policy. Depend upon it, this bu&s;ine&s;s cannot be indifferent to our fame. It will turn out a matter of great di&s;grace or great glory to the whole Briti&s;h nation. We are on a con&s;picuous &s;tage, and the world marks our de|meanour.</P>
<P>I am therefore a little concerned to perceive the &s;pirit and temper in which the debate has been all along pur&s;ued, upon one &s;ide of the Hou&s;e. The declamation of the Gentlemen who oppo&s;e the bill has been abundant and vehement, but they have been re&s;erved and even &s;ilent about the fitne&s;s or unfitne&s;s of the plan to attain the direct ob|ject it has in view. By &s;ome gentlemen it is taken up (by way of exerci&s;e I pre&s;ume) as a point of law on a que&s;tion of private property, and corporate franchi&s;e; by others it is re|garded as the petty intrigue of a faction at court, and argued merely as it tends to &s;et this man a little higher, or that a little lower in &s;itua|tion and power. All the void has been filled up with invectives again&s;t coalition; with allu&s;ions to the lo&s;s of America; with the activity and in|activity of mini&s;ters. The total &s;ilence of the&s;e gentlemen concerning the intere&s;t and well-being of the people of India, and concerning the intere&s;t which this nation has in the commerce and reve|nues of that country, is a &s;trong indication of the value which they &s;et upon the&s;e objects.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">It has been a little painful to me to ob&s;erve the intru&s;ion into this important debate of &s;uch com|pany as <HI>Quo Warranto,</HI> and <HI>Mandamus,</HI> and <HI>Certiorari</HI>; as if we were on a trial about mayors and aldermen, and capital burge&s;&s;es; or engaged in a &s;uit concerning the borough of Penryn, or Salta&s;h, or St. Ives, or St. Mawes. Gentlemen have argued with as much heat and pa&s;&s;ion, as if the fir&s;t things in the world were at &s;take; and their topics are &s;uch, as belong only to matter of the lowe&s;t and meane&s;t litigation. It is not right, it is not worthy of us, in this manner to depreci|ate the value, to degrade the maje&s;ty of this grave deliberation of policy and empire.</P>
<P>For my part, I have thought my&s;elf bound, when a matter of this extraordinary weight came before me, not to con&s;ider (as &s;ome Gentlemen are &s;o fond of doing) whether the bill originated from a Secretary of State for the home department, or from a Secretary for the foreign; from a mini&s;|ter of influence or a mini&s;ter of the people; from Jacob or from E&s;au<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An allu&s;ion made by Mr. Powis.</NOTE>. I a&s;ked my&s;elf, and I a&s;ked my&s;elf nothing el&s;e, what part it was fit for a member of parliament, who has &s;upplied a mediocrity of talents by the extreme of diligence, and who has thought him&s;elf obliged, by the re|&s;earch of years, to wind him&s;elf into the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es and labyrinths of the Indian detail, what part, I &s;ay, it became &s;uch a member of parlia|ment to take, when a mini&s;ter of &s;tate, in con|formity to a recommendation from the throne, has brought before us a &s;y&s;tem for the better govern|ment of the territory and commerce of the Ea&s;t. In this light, and in this only, I will trouble you with my &s;entiments.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">It is not only agreed but demanded, by the Right Honourable gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pitt.</NOTE>, and by tho&s;e who act with him, that a <HI>whole</HI> &s;y&s;tem ought to be produced; that it ought not to be an <HI>half mea&s;ure</HI>; that it ought to be no <HI>palliative</HI>; but a legi&s;lative provi&s;ion, vigorous, &s;ub&s;tantial, and effective.&mdash;I believe that no man who under|&s;tands the &s;ubject can doubt for a moment, that tho&s;e mu&s;t be the conditions of any thing de&s;erving the name of a reform in the Indian government; that any thing &s;hort of them would not only be delu&s;ive, but, in this matter which admits no medium, noxious in the ex|treme.</P>
<P>To all the conditions propo&s;ed by his adver|&s;aries the mover of the bill perfectly agrees; and on his performance of them he re&s;ts his cau&s;e. On the other hand, not the lea&s;t objec|tion has been taken, with regard to the efficiency, the vigour, or the completene&s;s of the &s;cheme. I am therefore warranted to a&s;&s;ume, as a thing admitted, that the bills accompli&s;h what both &s;ides of the Hou&s;e demand as e&s;&s;ential. The end is completely an&s;wered, &s;o far as the direct and immediate object is concerned.</P>
<P>But though there are no direct, yet there are various collateral objections made; objections from the effects, which this plan of reform for Indian admini&s;tration may have on the privileges of great public bodies in England; from its pro|bable influence on the con&s;titutional rights, or on the freedom and integrity of the &s;everal branches of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">Before I an&s;wer the&s;e objections I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, that if we are not able to con|trive &s;ome method of governing India <HI>well,</HI> which will not of nece&s;&s;ity become the means or govern|ing Great Britain <HI>ill,</HI> a ground is laid for their eternal &s;eparation; but none for &s;acrificing the people of that country to our con&s;titution. I am however far from being per&s;uaded that any &s;uch in|compatibility of intere&s;t does at all exi&s;t. On the contrary I am certain that every means, effectual to pre&s;erve India from oppre&s;&s;ion, is a guard to pre|&s;erve the Briti&s;h con&s;titution from its wor&s;t cor|ruption. To &s;hew this, I will con&s;ider the ob|jections, which I think are four.<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. That the bill is an attack on the chartered rights of men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2dly. That it increa&s;es the influence of the crown.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3dly. That it does <HI>not</HI> increa&s;e, but dimini&s;hes, the influence of the crown, in order to pro|mote the intere&s;ts of certain mini&s;ters and their party.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4thly. That it deeply affects the national credit.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e objections; I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve that the phra&s;e of
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the chartered rights <HI>of men,</HI>"</Q> is full, of affectation; and very unu&s;ual in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of privileges conferred by char|ters of the pre&s;ent de&s;cription.
But it is not dif|ficult to di&s;cover what end that ambiguous mode of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;o often reiterated, is meant to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The rights of <HI>men,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the natural rights of mankind, are indeed &s;acred things; and if any public mea&s;ure is proved mi&s;chievou&s;ly to affect them, the objection ought to be fatal to that
<PB N="6" REF="7">
mea&s;ure, even if no charter at all could be &s;et up a|gain&s;t it. If the&s;e natural rights are further affirm|ed and declared by expre&s;s covenants, if they are clearly defined and &s;ecured again&s;t chicane, again&s;t power, and authority, by written in&s;truments and po&s;itive engagements, they are in a &s;till better condition: they partake not only of the &s;anctity of the object &s;o &s;ecured, but of that &s;olemn pub|lic faith it&s;elf, which &s;ecures an object of &s;uch importance. Indeed this formal recognition, by the &s;overeign power, of an original right in the &s;ubject, can never be &s;ubverted, but by rooting up the holding radical principles of government, and even of &s;ociety it&s;elf. The charters, which we call by di&s;tinction <HI>great,</HI> are public in&s;truments of this nature; I mean the charters of King John and King Henry the Third. The things &s;ecured by the&s;e in&s;truments may, without any deceitful ambiguity, be very fitly called the <HI>chartered rights of men.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e charters have made the very name of a charter dear to the heart of every Engli&s;hman&mdash;But, Sir, there may be, and there are charters, not only different in nature, but formed on principles the <HI>very rever&s;e</HI> of tho&s;e of the great charter. Of this kind is the charter of the Ea&s;t India Company. <HI>Magna charta</HI> is a charter to re&s;train power, and to de&s;troy monopoly. The Ea&s;t India charter is a charter to e&s;tabli&s;h monopoly, and to create power. Political power and commercial mono|poly are <HI>not</HI> the rights of men; and the rights to them derived from charters, it is fallacious and &s;ophi&s;tical to call <Q REND="inline">"the chartered rights of men."</Q> The&s;e chartered rights, (to &s;peak of &s;uch char|ters and of their effects in terms of the greate&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="8">
po&s;&s;ible moderation) do at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pend the natural rights of mankind at large; and in their very frame and con&s;titution are liable to fall into a direct violation of them.</P>
<P>It is a charter of this latter de&s;cription (that is to &s;ay a charter of power and monopoly) which is af|fected by the bill before you. The bill, Sir, does, without que&s;tion, affect it; it does affect it e&s;&s;en|tially and &s;ub&s;tantially. But, having &s;tated to you of what de&s;cription the chartered rights are which this bill touches, I feel no difficulty at all in acknow|ledging the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e chartered rights, in their fulle&s;t extent. They belong to the Company in the &s;ure&s;t manner; and they are &s;ecured to that body by every &s;ort of public &s;anction. They are &s;tamped by the faith of the King; they are &s;tamped by the &s;aith of Parliament; they have been bought for money, for money hone&s;tly and fairly paid; they have been bought for valuable con&s;ideration, over and over again.</P>
<P>I therefore freely admit to the Ea&s;t India Com|pany their claim to exclude their fellow-&s;ubjects from the commerce of half the globe. I admit their claim to admini&s;ter an annual territorial re|venue of &s;even millions &s;terling; to command an army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men; and to di&s;po&s;e, (under the control of a &s;overeign imperial di&s;cretion, and with the due ob&s;ervance of the natural and local law) of the lives and fortunes of thirty millions of their fellow-creatures. All this they po&s;&s;e&s;s by charter and by acts of parliament, (in my opinion) without a &s;hadow of controver&s;y.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who carry the rights and claims of the Company the furthe&s;t do not contend for more than this; and all this I freely grant. But granting all this, they mu&s;t grant to me in my turn, that all political power which is &s;et over men, and that
<PB N="8" REF="9">
all privilege claimed or exerci&s;ed in exclu&s;ion of them, being wholly artificial, and for &s;o much, a derogation from the natural equality of mankind at large, ought to be &s;ome way or other exerci&s;ed ultimately for their benefit.</P>
<P>If this is true with regard to every &s;pecies of political dominion, and every de&s;cription of com|mercial privilege, none of which can be ori|ginal &s;elf-derived rights, or grants for the mere private benefit of the holders, then &s;uch rights, or privileges, or whatever el&s;e you choo&s;e to call them, are all in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e a <HI>tru&s;t</HI>; and it is of the very e&s;&s;ence of every tru&s;t to be ren|dered <HI>accountable</HI>; and even totally to <HI>cea&s;e,</HI> when it &s;ub&s;tantially varies from the purpo&s;es for which alone it could have a lawful exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>This I conceive, Sir, to be true of tru&s;ts of power ve&s;ted in the highe&s;t hands, and of &s;uch as &s;eem to hold of no human creature. But about the application of this principle to &s;ubordinate <HI>derivative</HI> tru&s;ts, I do not &s;ee how a controver&s;y can be maintained. To whom then would I make the Ea&s;t India Company accountable? Why, to Parliament to be &s;ure; to Parliament, from whom their tru&s;t was derived; to Parliament, which alone is capable of comprehending the magnitude of its object, and its abu&s;e; and alone capable of an effectual legi&s;lative remedy. The very charter, which is held out to exclude Parliament from cor|recting malver&s;ation with regard to the high tru&s;t ve&s;ted in the Company, is the very thing which at once gives a title and impo&s;es a duty on us to interfere with effect, wherever power and autho|rity originating from our&s;elves are perverted from their purpo&s;es, and become in&s;truments of wrong and violence.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">If Parliament, Sir, had nothing to do with this charter, we might have &s;ome &s;ort of Epicurean excu&s;e to &s;tand aloof, indifferent &s;pectators of what pa&s;&s;es in the Company's name in India and in London. But if we are the very cau&s;e of the evil, we are in a &s;pecial manner engaged to the redre&s;s; and for us pa&s;&s;ively to bear with op|pre&s;&s;ions committed under the &s;anction of our own authority, is in truth and rea&s;on for this Hou&s;e to be an active accomplice in the abu&s;e.</P>
<P>That the power notoriou&s;ly, gro&s;sly, abu&s;ed has been bought from us is very certain. But this circum&s;tance, which is urged again&s;t the bill, be|comes an additional motive for our interference; le&s;t we &s;hould be thought to have &s;old the blood of millions of men, for the ba&s;e con&s;ideration of money. We &s;old, I admit, all that we had to &s;ell; that is our authority, not our controul. We had not a right to make a market of our duties.</P>
<P>I ground my&s;elf therefore on this princi|ple&mdash;that if the abu&s;e is proved, the contract is broken; and we re-enter into all our rights; that is, into the exerci&s;e of all our duties. Our own authority is indeed as much a tru&s;t origi|nally, as the Company's authority is a tru&s;t deri|vatively; and it is the u&s;e we make of the re|&s;umed power that mu&s;t ju&s;tify or condemn us in the re&s;umption of it. When we have perfected the plan laid before us by the Right Honourable mover, the world will then &s;ee what it is we de|&s;troy, and what it is we create. By that te&s;t we &s;tand or fall; and by that te&s;t I tru&s;t that it will be found in the i&s;&s;ue, that we are going to &s;uper|&s;ede a charter abu&s;ed to the full extent of all the powers which it could abu&s;e, and exerci&s;ed in the plenitude of de&s;poti&s;m, tyranny, and corruption;
<PB N="10" REF="11">
and that, in one and the &s;ame plan, we pro|vide a real chartered &s;ecurity for the <HI>rights of men</HI> cruelly violated under that charter.</P>
<P>This bill, and tho&s;e connected with it, are in|tended to form the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of Hindo&s;tan. Whatever the treaty of We&s;tphalia is to the liberty of the princes and free cities of the empire, and to the three religions there profe&s;&s;ed&mdash;Whatever the great charter, the &s;tatute of tallage, the pe|tition of right, and the declaration of right, are to Great Britain, the&s;e bills are to the people of India. Of this benefit, I am certain, their con|dition is capable; and when I know that they are capable of more, my vote &s;hall mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly be for our giving to the full extent of their capacity of receiving; and no charter of dominion &s;hall &s;tand as a bar in my way to their charter of &s;afety and protection.</P>
<P>The &s;trong admi&s;&s;ion I have made of the Com|pany's rights (I am con&s;cious of it) binds me to do a great deal. I do not pre&s;ume to condemn tho&s;e who argue <HI>a priori,</HI> again&s;t the propriety of leaving &s;uch exten&s;ive political powers in the hands of a company of merchants. I know much is, and much more may be &s;aid again&s;t &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem. But, with my particular ideas and &s;en|timents, I cannot go that way to work. I feel an in&s;uperable reluctance in giving my hand to de&s;troy any e&s;tabli&s;hed in&s;titution of government, upon a theory, however plau&s;ible it may be. My experience in life teaches me nothing clear upon the &s;ubject. I have known merchants with the &s;entiments and the abilities of great &s;tate&s;men; and I have &s;een per&s;ons in the rank of &s;tate&s;men, with the conceptions and character of pedlars. Indeed, my ob&s;ervation has furni&s;hed me with
<PB N="11" REF="12">
nothing that is to be found in any habits of life or education, which tends wholly to di&s;qualify men for the functions of government, but that, by which the power of exerci&s;ing tho&s;e functions is very frequently obtained. I mean, a &s;pirit and habits of low cabal and intrigue; which I have never, in one in&s;tance, &s;een united with a capa|city for &s;ound and manly policy.</P>
<P>To ju&s;tify us in taking the admini&s;tration of their affairs out of the hands of the Ea&s;t India Company, on my principles, I mu&s;t &s;ee &s;everal conditions. 1&s;t. The object affected by the abu&s;e &s;hould be great and important. 2d. The abu&s;e affecting this great object ought to be a great abu&s;e. 3d. It ought to be habitual, and not acci|dental. 4th. It ought to be utterly incurable in the body as it now &s;tands con&s;tituted. All this ought to be made as vi&s;ible to me as the light of the &s;un, before I &s;hould &s;trike off an atom of their charter. A Right Honourable gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pitt.</NOTE> has &s;aid, and &s;aid I think but once, and that very &s;lightly (whatever his original demand for a plan might &s;eem to require) that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"there are abu&s;es in the Company's government."</Q>
If that were all, the &s;cheme of the mover of this bill, the &s;cheme of his learned friend, and his own &s;cheme of refor|mation (if he has any) are all equally needle&s;s. There are, and mu&s;t be, abu&s;es in all govern|ments. It amounts to no more than a nugatory propo&s;ition. But before I con&s;ider of what nature the&s;e abu&s;es are, of when the gentleman &s;peaks &s;o very lightly, permit me to recall to your recol|lection the map of the country which this abu&s;ed chartered right affects. This I &s;hall do, that you
<PB N="12" REF="13">
may judge whether in that map I can di&s;cover any thing like the fir&s;t of my conditions; that is, Whether the object affected by the abu&s;e of the Ea&s;t India Company's power be of impor|tance &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the mea&s;ure and means of reform applied to it in this bill.</P>
<P>With very few, and tho&s;e incon&s;iderable inter|vals, the Briti&s;h dominion, either in the Company's name, or in the names of princes ab&s;olutely de|pendent upon the Company, extends from the mountains that &s;eparate India from Tartary, to Cape Comorin, that is, one-and-twenty degrees of latitude!</P>
<P>In the northern parts it is a &s;olid ma&s;s of land, about eight hundred miles in length, and four or five hundred broad. As you go &s;outhward, it becomes narrower for a &s;pace. It afterwards dilates; but narrower or broader, you po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole ea&s;tern and north-ea&s;tern coa&s;t of that va&s;t country, quite from the borders of Pegu. &mdash; Bengal, Bahar, and Ori&s;&s;a, with Benares (now unfortunately in our immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion) mea&s;ure 161,978 &s;quare Engli&s;h miles; a territory con&s;iderably larger than the whole kingdom of France. Oude, with its dependent provinces, is 53,286 &s;quare miles, not a great deal le&s;s than England. The Carnatic, with Tanjour and the Circars, is 65,948 &s;quare miles, very con&s;iderably larger than England; and the whole of the Company's dominion comprehending Bombay and Sal&s;ette, amounts to 281,412 &s;quare miles; which forms a territory larger than any European dominion, Ru&s;&s;ia and Turkey excepted. Through all that va&s;t extent of country there is not a man who eats a mouthful of rice but by permi&s;&s;ion of the Ea&s;t India Company.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">So far with regard to the extent. The popu|lation of this great empire is not ea&s;y to be calculated. When the countries, of which it is compo&s;ed, came into our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they were all eminently peopled, and eminently pro|ductive; though at that time con&s;iderably de|clined from their antient pro&s;perity. But &s;ince they are come into our hands!&mdash;! How|ever if we take the period of our e&s;timate im|mediately before the utter de&s;olation of the Car|natic, and if we allow for the havoc which our government had even then made in the&s;e regions, we cannot, in my opinion, rate the population at much le&s;s than thirty millions of &s;ouls; more than four times the number of per&s;ons in the i&s;land of Great Britain.</P>
<P>My next enquiry to that of the number, is the quality and de&s;cription of the inhabitants. This multitude of men does not con&s;i&s;t of an abject and barbarous populace; much le&s;s of gangs of &s;avages, like the Guaranies and Chiquitos, who wander on the wa&s;te borders of the river of Amazons, or the Plate; but a people for ages civilized and cultivated; cultivated by all the arts of poli&s;hed life, whil&s;t we were yet in the woods. There, have been (and &s;till the &s;keletons remain) princes once of great dignity, authority, and opulence. There, are to be found the chiefs of tribes and nations. There is to be found an antient and venerable prie&s;thood, the depo&s;itory of their laws, learning, and hi&s;tory, the guides of the people whil&s;t living, and their con&s;olation in death; a nobility of great antiquity and re|nown; a multitude of cities, not exceeded in population and trade by tho&s;e of the fir&s;t cla&s;s in Europe; merchants and bankers, individual
<PB N="14" REF="15">
hou&s;es of whom have once vied in capital with the Bank of England; who&s;e credit had often &s;upported a tottering &s;tate, and pre&s;erved their governments in the mid&s;t of war and de&s;olation; millions of ingenious manufacturers and me|chanicks; millions of the mo&s;t diligent, and not the lea&s;t intelligent, tillers of the earth. Here are to be found almo&s;t all the religions profe&s;&s;ed by men, the Bramincal, the Mu&s;&s;ulmen, the Ea&s;tern and the We&s;tern Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>If I were to take the whole aggregate of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions there, I &s;hould compare it, as the neare&s;t parallel I can find, with the empire of Germany. Our immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions I &s;hould compare with the Au&s;trian dominions, and they would not &s;uffer in the compari&s;on. The Nabob of Oude might &s;tand for the King of Pru&s;&s;ia; the Nabob of Arcot I would compare, as &s;u|perior in territory, and equal in revenue, to the Elector of Saxony. Cheyt Sing, the Rajah of Benares, might well rank with the Prince of He&s;&s;e at lea&s;t; and the Rajah of Tanjore (though hardly equal in extent of dominion, &s;uperior in revenue) to the Elector of Bavaria. The Polygars and the northern Zemindars, and other great chiefs, might well cla&s;s with the re&s;t of the Princes, Dukes, Counts, Marqui&s;&s;es, and Bi&s;hops in the empire; all of whom I mention to ho|nour, and &s;urely without di&s;paragement to any or all of tho&s;e mo&s;t re&s;pectable princes and gran|dees.</P>
<P>All this va&s;t ma&s;s, compo&s;ed of &s;o many orders and cla&s;&s;es of men, is again infinitely diver&s;ified by manners, by religion, by hereditary employment, through all their po&s;&s;ible combinations. This renders the handling of India a matter in an
<PB N="15" REF="16">
high degree critical and delicate. But oh! it has been handled rudely indeed. Even &s;ome of the reformers &s;eem to have forgot that they had any thing to do but to regulate the tenants of a manor, or the &s;hopkeepers of the next county town.</P>
<P>It is an empire of this extent, of this compli|cated nature, of this dignity and importance, that I have compared to Germany, and the Ger|man government; not for an exact re&s;emblance, but as a &s;ort of a middle term, by which India might be approximated to our under&s;tandings, and if po&s;&s;ible to our feelings; in order to awaken &s;omething of &s;ympathy for the unfortunate na|tives, of which I am afraid we are not perfectly &s;u&s;ceptible, whil&s;t we look at this very remote object through a fal&s;e and cloudy medium.</P>
<P>My &s;econd condition, nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify me in touching the charter, is, Whether the Company's abu&s;e of their tru&s;t, with regard to this great ob|ject, be an abu&s;e of great atrocity. I &s;hall beg your permi&s;&s;ion to con&s;ider their conduct in two lights; fir&s;t the political, and then the commercial. Their political conduct (for di&s;tinctne&s;s) I divide again into two heads; the external, in which I mean to comprehend their conduct in their federal capacity, as it relates to powers and &s;tates inde|pendent, or that not long &s;ince were &s;uch; the other internal, namely their conduct to the coun|tries either immediately &s;ubject to the Company, or to tho&s;e who, under the apparent government of native &s;overeigns, are in a &s;tate much lower, and much more mi&s;erable, than common &s;ub|jection.</P>
<P>The attention, Sir, which I wi&s;h to pre&s;erve to method will not be con&s;idered as unnece&s;&s;ary or
<PB N="16" REF="17">
affected. Nothing el&s;e can help me to &s;election out of the infinite ma&s;s of materials which have pa&s;&s;ed under my eye; or can keep my mind &s;teady to the great leading points I have in view.</P>
<P>With regard therefore to the abu&s;e of the ex|ternal federal tru&s;t, I engage my&s;elf to you to make good the&s;e three po&s;itions:&mdash;Fir&s;t, I &s;ay, that from Mount Imaus, (or whatever el&s;e you call that large range of mountains that walls the northern frontier of India) where it touches us in the latitude of twenty-nine, to Cape Comorin, in the latitude of eight, that there is not a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> prince, &s;tate, or potentate, great or &s;mall, in In|dia, with whom they have come into contact, whom they have not &s;old. I &s;ay <HI>&s;old,</HI> though &s;ometimes they have not been able to deliver according to their bargain.&mdash;Secondly, I &s;ay, that there is not a <HI>&s;ingle treaty</HI> they have ever made, which they have not broken.&mdash;Thirdly, I &s;ay, that there is not a &s;ingle prince or &s;tate, who ever put any tru&s;t in the Company, who is not utterly ruined; and that none are in any degree &s;ecure or flouri&s;hing, but in the exact proportion to their &s;ettled di&s;tru&s;t and irreconcileable enmity to this nation.</P>
<P>The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions are univer&s;al. I &s;ay in the full &s;en&s;e <HI>univer&s;al.</HI> They regard the external and political tru&s;t only; but I &s;hall produce others fully equivalent, in the internal. For the pre&s;ent, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with explaining my mean|ing; and if I am called on for proof whil&s;t the&s;e bills are depending (which I believe I &s;hall not) I will put my finger on the Appendixes to the Reports, or on papers of record in the Hou&s;e, or the Committees, which I have di&s;tinctly pre&s;ent to my memory, and which I think I can lay before you at half an hour's warning.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">The fir&s;t potentate &s;old by the Company for money was the Great Mogul&mdash;the de&s;cendant of Tamerlane. This high per&s;onage, as high as hu|man veneration can look at, is by every account amiable in his manners, re&s;pectable for his piety according to his mode, and accompli&s;hed in all the Oriental literature. All this, and the title derived under his <HI>charter,</HI> to all that we hold in India, could not &s;ave him from the general <HI>&s;ale.</HI> Mo|ney is coined in his name; In his name ju&s;tice is admini&s;tered; He is prayed for in every temple through the countries we po&s;&s;e&s;s&mdash;But he was &s;old.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, Mr. Speaker, not to pau&s;e here for a moment, to reflect on the incon&s;tancy of human greatne&s;s, and the &s;tupendous revolutions that have happened in our age of wonders. Could it be believed, when I entered into exi&s;tence, or when you, a younger man, were born, that on this day, in this Hou&s;e, we &s;hould be employed in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the conduct of tho&s;e Briti&s;h &s;ubjects who had di&s;po&s;ed of the power and per&s;on of the Grand Mogul? This is no idle &s;peculation. Awful le&s;&s;ons are taught by it, and by other events, of which it is not yet too late to profit.</P>
<P>This is hardly a digre&s;&s;ion; but I return to the &s;ale of the Mogul. Two di&s;tricts, Corah and Allahabad, out of his immen&s;e grants, were re|&s;erved as a royal deme&s;ne to the donor of a kingdom, and the rightful &s;overeign of &s;o many nations. &mdash; After withholding the tribute of &pound;.260,000 a year, which the Company was, by the <HI>charter</HI> they had received from this prince, under the mo&s;t &s;olemn obligation to pay, the&s;e di&s;tricts were &s;old to his chief mini&s;ter Sujah ul Dowlah; and, what may appear to &s;ome the wor&s;t part of
<PB N="18" REF="19">
the tran&s;action, the&s;e two di&s;tricts were &s;old for &s;carcely two years purcha&s;e. The de&s;cendant of Tamerlane now &s;tands in need almo&s;t of the com|mon nece&s;&s;aries of life; and in this &s;ituation we do not even allow him, as bounty, the &s;malle&s;t portion of what we owe him in ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The next &s;ale was that of the whole nation of the Rohillas, which the grand &s;ale&s;man, without a pretence of quarrel, and contrary to his own de|clared &s;en&s;e of duty and rectitude, &s;old to the &s;ame Sujah ul Dowlah. He &s;old the people to utter <HI>extirpation,</HI> for the &s;um of four hundred thou&s;and pounds. Faithfully was the bargain per|formed upon our &s;ide. Hafiz Rhamet, the mo&s;t eminent of their chiefs, one of the brave&s;t men of his time, and as famous throughout the Ea&s;t for the elegance of his literature, and the &s;pirit of his poetical compo&s;itions (by which he &s;upported the name of Hafiz) as for his courage, was invaded with an army of an hundred thou&s;and men, and an Engli&s;h brigade. This man, at the head of inferior forces, was &s;lain valiantly fighting for his country. His head was cut off, and delivered for money to a barbarian. His wife and children, per&s;ons of that rank, were &s;een begging an handful of rice through the Engli&s;h camp. The whole nation, with incon&s;iderable exceptions, was &s;laugh|tered or bani&s;hed. The country was laid wa&s;te with fire and &s;word; and that land di&s;tingui&s;hed above mo&s;t others, by the chearful face of paternal government and protected labour, the cho&s;en &s;eat of cultivation and plenty, is now almo&s;t through|out a dreary de&s;art, covered with ru&s;hes and briars, and jungles full of wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h officer who commanded in the delivery of the people thus &s;old, felt &s;ome
<PB N="19" REF="20">
compunction at his employment. He repre&s;ented the&s;e enormous exce&s;&s;es to the pre&s;ident of Ben|gal, for which he received a &s;evere reprimand from the civil governor; and I much doubt whether the breach cau&s;ed by the conflict, between the compa&s;&s;ion of the military and the firmne&s;s of the civil governor, be clo&s;ed at this hour.</P>
<P>In Bengal, Seraja Dowla was &s;old to Mir Jaffier; Mir Jaffier was &s;old to Mir Co&s;&s;im; and Mir Co&s;|&s;im was &s;old to Mir Jaffier again. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to Mir Jaffier was &s;old to his elde&s;t &s;on;&mdash;another &s;on of Mir Jaffier, Mobarech ul Dowla, was &s;old to his &s;tep-mother&mdash;The Maratta empire was &s;old to Ragoba; and Ragoba was &s;old and delivered to the Pei&s;hwa of the Marattas. Both Ragoba and the Pei&s;hwa of the Marattas were offered to &s;ale to the Rajah of Berar. Scindia, the chief of Malva, was offered to &s;ale to the &s;ame Rajah; and the Subah of the Decan was &s;old to the great trader Mahomet Ali, Nabob of Arcot. To the &s;ame Nabob of Arcot they &s;old Hyder Ali and the kingdom of My&s;ore. To Mahomet Ali they twice &s;old the kingdom of Tanjore. To the &s;ame Mahomet Ali they &s;old at lea&s;t twelve &s;ove|reign princes, called the Polygars. But to keep things even, the territory of Tinnivelly, belong|ing to their Nabob, they would have &s;old to the Dutch; and to conclude the account of &s;ales, their great cu&s;tomer, the Nabob of Arcot him&s;elf, and his lawful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, has been &s;old to his &s;econd &s;on, Amir ul Omrah, who&s;e character, views, and conduct, are in the accounts upon your table. It remains with you whether they &s;hall finally perfect this la&s;t bargain.</P>
<P>All the&s;e bargains and &s;ales were regularly at|tended with the wa&s;te and havoc of the country, always by the buyer, and &s;ometimes by the
<PB N="20" REF="21">
object of the &s;ale. This was explained to you by the Honourable mover, when he &s;tated the mode of paying debts due from the country powers to the Company. An Honourable gentleman, who is not now in his place, objected to his jumping near two thou&s;and miles for an example. But the &s;outhern example is perfectly applicable to the northern claim, as the northern is to the &s;outhern;&mdash;for, throughout the whole &s;pace of the&s;e two thou&s;and miles, take your &s;tand where you will, the proceeding is perfectly uniform, and what is done in one part will apply exactly to the other.</P>
<P>My &s;econd a&s;&s;ertion is, that the Company never has made a treaty which they have not broken. This po&s;ition is &s;o connected with that of the &s;ales of provinces and kingdoms, with the negotiation of univer&s;al di&s;traction in every part of India, that a very minute detail may well be &s;pared on this point. It has not yet been contended, by any enemy to the reform, that they have ob&s;erved any public agreement. When I hear that they have done &s;o in any one in&s;tance (which hitherto, I confe&s;s, I never heard alledged) I &s;hall &s;peak to the particular treaty. The governor general has even amu&s;ed him&s;elf and the Court of Directors in a very &s;ingular letter to that board, in which he admits he has not been very delicate with regard to public faith; and he goes &s;o far as to &s;tate a regular e&s;timate of the &s;ums which the Company would have lo&s;t, or never acquired, if the rigid ideas of public faith entertained by his colleagues had been ob&s;erved. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dundas, Lord Advocate of Scotland.</NOTE>The learned gentleman over again&s;t me has indeed &s;aved me much trouble. On a former occa&s;ion he obtained no &s;mall credit, for the clear and forcible manner in which he
<PB N="21" REF="22">
&s;tated what we have not forgot, and I hope he has not forgot, that univer&s;al &s;y&s;tematic breach of treaties which had made the Briti&s;h faith pro|verbial in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>It only remains, Sir, for me ju&s;t to recapitu|late &s;ome heads.&mdash;The treaty with the Mogul, by which we &s;tipulated to pay him &pound;.260,000 annually, was broken. This treaty they have broken, and not paid him a &s;hilling. They broke their treaty with him, in which they &s;ti|pulated to pay &pound;.400,000 a year to the Soubah of Bengal. They agreed with the Mogul, for &s;ervices admitted to have been performed, to pay Nudjif Cawn a pen&s;ion. They broke this ar|ticle with the re&s;t, and &s;topped al&s;o this &s;mall pen&s;ion. They broke their treaties with the Nizam, and with Hyder Ali. As to the Ma|rattas, they had &s;o many cro&s;s treaties with the States General of that nation, and with each of the chiefs, that it was notorious, that no one of the&s;e agreements could be kept without gro&s;sly violating the re&s;t. It was ob&s;erved, that if the terms of the&s;e &s;everal treaties had been kept, two Briti&s;h armies would at one and the &s;ame time have met in the field to cut each other's throats. The wars which de&s;olate India, origi|nated from a mo&s;t atrocious violation of public faith on our part. In the mid&s;t of profound peace, the Company's troops invaded the Ma|ratta territories, and &s;urpri&s;ed the i&s;land and fortre&s;s of Sal&s;ette. The Marattas neverthele&s;s yielded to a treaty of peace, by which &s;olid ad|vantages were procured to the Company. But this treaty, like every other treaty, was &s;oon violated by the Company. Again the Com|pany invaded the Maratta dominions. The di&s;a&s;ter that en&s;ued gave occa&s;ion to a new
<PB N="22" REF="23">
treaty. The whole army of the Company was obliged, in effect, to &s;urrender to this injured, betrayed, and in&s;ulted people. Ju&s;tly irritated however, as they were, the terms which they pre&s;cribed were rea&s;onable and moderate; and their treatment of their captive invaders, of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed humanity. But the hu|manity of the Marattas was of no power what|&s;oever to prevail on the Company to attend to the ob&s;ervance of the terms dictated by their moderation. The war was renewed with greater vigour than ever; and &s;uch was their in|&s;atiable lu&s;t of plunder, that they never would have given ear to any terms of peace, if Hyder Ali had not broke through the Gauts, and ru&s;hing like a torrent into the Carnatic, &s;wept away every thing in his career. This was in con&s;equence of that confederacy, which by a &s;ort of miracle united the mo&s;t di&s;cordant powers for our de&s;truction, as a nation in which no other could put any tru&s;t, and who were the declared enemies of the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that the late controver&s;y between the &s;everal pre&s;idencies, and between them and the Court of Directors, with relation to the&s;e wars and treaties, has not been, which of the parties might be defended for his &s;hare in them; but on which of the parties the guilt of all this load of perfidy &s;hould be fixed. But I am content to admit all the&s;e proceedings to be per|fectly regular, to be full of honour and good faith; and wi&s;h to fix your attention &s;olely to that &s;ingle tran&s;action which the advocates of this &s;y&s;|tem &s;elect for &s;o tran&s;cendant a merit as to cancel the guilt of all the re&s;t of their proceedings; I mean the late treaties with the Marattas.</P>
<P>I make no ob&s;ervation on the total ce&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="23" REF="24">
territory, by which they &s;urrendered all they had obtained by their unhappy &s;ucce&s;&s;es in war, and almo&s;t all that they had obtained under the treaty of Poor under. The re&s;titution was proper, if it had been voluntary and &s;ea&s;onable. I attach on the &s;pi|rit of the treaty, the di&s;po&s;itions it &s;hewed, the provi&s;ions it made for a general peace, and the faith kept with allies and confederates; in order that the Hou&s;e may form a judgment, from this cho&s;en piece, of the u&s;e which has been made (and is likely to be made, if things continue in the &s;ame hands) of the tru&s;t of the federal powers of this country.</P>
<P>It was the wi&s;h of almo&s;t every Engli&s;hman, that the Maratta peace might lead to a ge|neral one; becau&s;e the Maratta war was only a part of a general confederacy formed again&s;t us on account of the univer&s;al ab|horrence of our conduct which prevailed in every &s;tate and almo&s;t in every hou&s;e in India. Mr. Ha&s;tings was obliged to pretend &s;ome &s;ort of acquie&s;cence in this general and ra|tional de&s;ire. He therefore con&s;ented, in order to &s;atisfy the point of honour of the Marattas, that an article &s;hould be in&s;erted to admit Hyder Ali to accede to the pacification. But ob&s;erve, Sir, the &s;pirit of this man (which if it were not made manife&s;t by a thou&s;and things, and parti|cularly by his proceedings with regard to Lord Macartney) would be &s;ufficiently manife&s;t by this&mdash;What &s;ort of article think you does he re|quire this e&s;&s;ential head of a &s;olemn treaty of ge|neral pacification to be? In his in&s;truction to Mr. Ander&s;on, he de&s;ires him to admit
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a <HI>vague</HI> article"</Q>  in favour of Hyder.
Eva&s;ion and fraud were the declared ba&s;is of the treaty. The&s;e <HI>vague</HI> articles, intended for a more vague per|formance,
<PB N="24" REF="25">
are the things which have damned our reputation in India.</P>
<P>Hardly was this vague article in&s;erted, than, without waiting for any act on the part of Hyder, Mr. Ha&s;tings enters into a negociation with the Maratta Chief, Scindia, for a partition of the ter|ritories of the prince who was one of the objects to be &s;ecured by the treaty. He was to be par|celled out in three parts&mdash;one to Scindia; one to the Pei&s;hwa of the Marattas; and the third to the Ea&s;t India Company, or to (the old dealer and chapman) Mahomet Ali.</P>
<P>During the formation or this project, Hyder dies; and before his &s;on could take any one &s;tep, either to conform to the tenour of the article, or to contravene it, the treaty of partition is renewed on the old footing, and an in&s;truction is &s;ent to Mr. Ander&s;on to conclude it in form.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance intervened, during the pen|dency of this negociation, to &s;et off the good faith of the Company with an additional brilliancy, and to make it &s;parkle and glow with a variety of &s;plendid faces. General Matthews had re|duced that mo&s;t valuable part of Hyder's do|minions called the Country of Biddenore. When the news reached Mr. Ha&s;tings he in&s;tructed Mr. Ander&s;on to contend for an alteration in the treaty of partition, and to take the Biddenore country out of the common &s;tock which was to be divided, and to keep it for the Com|pany.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ground for this variation was its being a &s;eparate conque&s;t made before the treaty had actually taken place. Here was a new proof given of the fairne&s;s, equity, and moderation, of the Company. But the &s;econd of Mr. Ha&s;tings's rea&s;ons for retaining the Biddenore as a &s;eparate
<PB N="25" REF="26">
portion, and his conduct on that &s;econd ground, is &s;till more remarkable. He a&s;&s;erted that that country could not be put into the partition &s;tock, becau&s;e General Matthews had received it on the terms of &s;ome convention, which might be in|compatible with the partition propo&s;ed. This was a rea&s;on in it&s;elf both honourable and &s;olid; and it &s;hewed a regard to faith &s;omewhere, and with &s;ome per&s;ons. But in order to demon&s;trate his utter contempt of the plighted faith which was alledged on one part as a rea&s;on for de|parting from it on another, and to prove his im|petuous de&s;ire for &s;owing a new war, even in the prepared &s;oil of a general pacification, he directs Mr. Ander&s;on, if he &s;hould find &s;trong difficul|ties impeding the partition, on the &s;core of the &s;ubtraction of Biddenore, wholly to abandon that claim, and to conclude the treaty on the original terms. General Matthews's convention was ju&s;t brought forward &s;ufficiently to demon&s;trate to the Marattas the &s;lippery hold which they had on their new confederate; on the other hand that con|vention being in&s;tantly abandoned, the people of India were taught, that no terms on which they can &s;urrender to the Company are to be re|garded, when farther conque&s;ts are in view.</P>
<P>Next, Sir, let me bring before you the pious care that was taken of our allies under that treaty which is the &s;ubject of the Company's applau&s;es. The&s;e allies were Ragonaut Row, for whom we had engaged to find a throne; the Guickwar, (one of the Guzerat princes) who was to be eman|cipated from the Maratta authority, and to grow great by &s;everal acce&s;&s;ions of dominion; and la&s;tly, the Rana of Gohud, with whom we had entered into a treaty of partition for eleven &s;ixteenths of our joint conque&s;ts. Some of the&s;e ine&s;timable
<PB N="26" REF="27">
&s;ecurities, called <HI>vague</HI> articles, were in&s;erted in favour of them all.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, the unhappy abdicated Pe&s;hwa, and pretender to the Maratta throne, Ragonaut Row, was delivered up to his people, with an article for &s;afety, and &s;ome provi&s;ion. This man, knowing how little vague the hatred of his countrymen was towards him, and well appri&s;ed of what black crimes he &s;tood accu&s;ed (among which our inva&s;ion of his country would not ap|pear the lea&s;t) took a mortal alarm at the &s;ecurity we had provided for him. He was thunder&s;truck at the article in his favour, by which he was &s;urren|dered to his enemies. He never had the lea&s;t notice of the treaty; and it was apprehended that he would fly to the protection of Hyder Ali, or &s;ome other, di&s;po&s;ed or able to protect him. He was therefore not left without comfort; for Mr. Ander&s;on did him the favour to &s;end a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger, de&s;iring him to be of good cheer and to fear nothing. And his old enemy, Scindia, at our reque&s;t, &s;ent him a me&s;&s;age equally well cal|culated to quiet his apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame treaty the Guickwar was to come again, with no better &s;ecurity, under the dominion of the Maratta &s;tate. As to the Rana of Gohud, a long negotiation depended for giving him up. At fir&s;t this was refu&s;ed by Mr. Ha&s;tings with great indignation; at another &s;tage it was ad|mitted as proper, becau&s;e he had &s;hewn him&s;elf a mo&s;t perfidious per&s;on. But at length a method of reconciling the&s;e extremes was found out, by contriving one of the u&s;ual articles in his favour. What I believe will appear beyond all belief, Mr. Ander&s;on exchanged the final ratifications of that treaty by which the Rana was nominally &s;ecured in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in the camp of the Maratta
<PB N="27" REF="28">
chief, Scindia, whil&s;t he was (really, and not nominally) battering the ca&s;tle of Gualior, which we had given, agreeably to treaty, to this de|luded ally. Scindia had already reduced the town; and was at the very time, by various detach|ments, reducing, one after another, the fortre&s;&s;es of our protected ally, as well as in the act of cha&s;ti&s;ing all the Rajahs who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted Colonel Camac in his inva&s;ion. I have &s;een in a letter from Calcutta, that the Rana of Gohud's agent would have re|pre&s;ented the&s;e ho&s;tilities (which went hand in hand with the protecting treaty) to Mr. Ha&s;tings; but he was not admitted to his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>In this manner the Company has acted with their allies in the Maratta war. But they did not re&s;t here: the Marattas were fearful le&s;t the per&s;ons delivered to them by that treaty &s;hould attempt to e&s;cape into the Briti&s;h territories, and thus might elude the puni&s;hment intended for them, and by reclaiming the treaty, might &s;tir up new di&s;turbances. To prevent this, they de|&s;ired an article to be in&s;erted in the &s;upplemental treaty, to which they had the ready con&s;ent of Mr. Ha&s;tings and the re&s;t of the Company's repre&s;entatives in Bengal. It was this,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Engli&s;h and Maratta governments mutual|ly agree not to afford refuge to any <HI>chiefs, merchants, or other per&s;ons,</HI> flying for protec|tion to the territories of the other."</Q>
This was readily a&s;&s;ented to, and a&s;&s;ented to without any exception whatever, in favour of our &s;ur|rendered allies. On their part a reciprocity was &s;tipulated which was not unnatural for a govern|ment like the Company's to a&s;k; a government, con&s;cious that many &s;ubjects had been, and would in future, be driven to fly from its juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>To complete the &s;y&s;tem of pacific intention
<PB N="28" REF="29">
and public faith, which predominate in the&s;e trea|ties, Mr. Ha&s;tings fairly re&s;olved to put all peace, except on the terms of ab&s;olute con|que&s;t, wholly out of his own power. For, by an article in this &s;econd treaty with Scindia, he binds the Company not to make any peace with Tippoo Saheb, without the con&s;ent of the Pei&s;hwa of the Marattas; and binds Scindia to him by a reci|procal engagement. The treaty between France and England obliges us mutually to withdraw our forces, if our allies in India do not accede to the peace within four months; Mr. Ha&s;tings's treaty obliges us to continue the war as long as the Pei&s;hwa thinks fit. We are now in that happy &s;ituation, that the breach of the treaty with France, or the violation of that with the Marattas, is inevitable; and we have only to take our choice.</P>
<P>My third a&s;&s;ertion, relative to the abu&s;e made of the right of war and peace is, that there are none who have ever confided in us who have not been utterly ruined. The examples I have given of Ragonaut Row, of Guickwar, of the Ranah of Gohud, are recent. There is proof more than enough in the condition of the Mogul; in the &s;lavery and indigence of the Nabob of Oude; the exile of the Rajah of Benares; the beggary of the Nabob of Bengal; the undone and captive condition of the Rajah and kingdom of Tanjour; the de&s;truction of the Polygars; and la&s;tly, in the de&s;truction of the Nabob of Arcot him&s;elf, who when his dominions were invaded was found en|tirely de&s;titute of troops, provi&s;ions, &s;tores, and (as he a&s;&s;erts) of money, being a million in debt to the Company, and four millions to others: the many millions which he had extorted from &s;o many extirpated princes and their de&s;olated coun|tries
<PB N="29" REF="30">
having (as he has frequently hinted) been ex|pended for the ground-rent of his man&s;ion-hou&s;e in an alley in the &s;uburbs of Madras. Compare the condition of all the&s;e princes with the power and authority of all the Maratta &s;tates; with the independence and dignity of the Soubah of the De|can; and the mighty &s;trength, the re&s;ources, and the manly &s;truggle of Hyder Ali; and then the Hou&s;e will di&s;cover the effects, on every power in India, of an ea&s;y confidence, or of a rooted di&s;tru&s;t in the faith of the Company.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of my rea&s;ons, grounded on the abu&s;e of the external political tru&s;t of that body, for thinking my&s;elf not only ju&s;tified but bound to declare again&s;t tho&s;e chartered rights which produce &s;o many wrongs. I &s;hould deem my&s;elf the wickede&s;t of men, if any vote of mine could contribute to the continuance of &s;o great an evil.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, according to the plan I propo&s;ed, I &s;hall take notice of the Company's internal go|vernment, as it is exerci&s;ed fir&s;t on the dependent provinces, and then as it affects tho&s;e under the direct and immediate authority of that body. And here, Sir, before I enter into the &s;pirit of their interior government, permit me to ob&s;erve to you, upon a few of the many lines of difference which are to be found between the vices of the Company's government, and tho&s;e of the con|querors who preceded us in India; that we may be enabled a little the better to &s;ee our way in an attempt to the nece&s;&s;ary reformation.</P>
<P>The &s;everal irruptions of Arabs, Tartars, and Per&s;ians, into India were, for the greater part, ferocious, bloody, and wa&s;teful in the extreme: our entrance into the dominion of that country was, as generally, with &s;mall comparative effu&s;ion of blood; being introduced by various frauds
<PB N="30" REF="31">
and delu&s;ions, and by taking advantage of the incurable, blind, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s animo&s;ity, which the &s;everal country powers bear towards each other, rather than by open force. But the difference in favour of the fir&s;t conquerors is this; the A&s;iatic conquerors very &s;oon abated of their ferocity, be|cau&s;e they made the conquered country their own. They ro&s;e or fell with the ri&s;e or fall of the territory they lived in. Fathers there de|po&s;ited the hopes of their po&s;terity; and chil|dren there beheld the monuments of their fathers. Here their lot was finally ca&s;t; and it is the natu|ral wi&s;h of all, that their lot &s;hould not be ca&s;t in a bad land. Poverty, &s;terility, and de&s;olation, are not a recreating pro&s;pect to the eye of man; and there are very few who can bear to grow old among the cur&s;es of a whole people. If their pa&s;&s;ion or their avarice drove the Tartar lords to acts of rapacity or tyranny, there was time enough, even in the &s;hort life of man, to bring round the ill effects of an abu&s;e of power upon the power it&s;elf. If hoards were made by violence and ty|ranny, they were &s;till dome&s;tic hoards; and do|me&s;tic profu&s;ion, or the rapine of a more powerful and prodigal hand, re&s;tored them to the people. With many di&s;orders, and with few political checks upon power, Nature had &s;till fair play; the &s;ources of acqui&s;ition were not dried up; and therefore the trade, the manufactures, and the com|merce of the country flouri&s;hed. Even avarice and u&s;ury it&s;elf operated, both for the pre&s;ervation and the employment of national wealth. The hu&s;bandman and manufacturer paid heavy intere&s;t, but then they augmented the fund from whence they were again to borrow. Their re&s;ources were dearly bought, but they were &s;ure; and the gene|ral &s;tock of the community grew by the general effort.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32">But under the Engli&s;h government all this or|der is rever&s;ed. The Tartar inva&s;ion was mi&s;|chievous; but it is our protection that de&s;troys India. It was their enmity, but it is our friend|&s;hip. Our conque&s;t there, after twenty years, is as crude as it was the fir&s;t day. The natives &s;carcely know what it is to &s;ee the grey head of an Engli&s;hman. Young men (boys almo&s;t) go|vern there, without &s;ociety, and without &s;ympathy with the natives. They have no more &s;ocial ha|bits with the people, than if they &s;till re&s;ided in England; nor indeed any &s;pecies of intercour&s;e but that which is nece&s;&s;ary to making a &s;udden fortune, with a view to a remote &s;ettlement. Animated with all the avarice of age, and all the impetuo&s;ity of youth, they roll in one after ano|ther; wave after wave; and there is nothing be|fore the eyes of the natives but an endle&s;s, hope|le&s;s pro&s;pect of new flights of birds of prey and pa&s;&s;age, with appetites continually renewing for a food that is continually wa&s;ting. Every rupee of profit made by an Engli&s;hman is lo&s;t for ever to India. With us are no retributory &s;uper&s;ti|tions, by which a foundation of charity compen|&s;ates, through ages, to the poor, for the rapine and inju&s;tice of a day. With us no pride erects &s;tately monuments which repair the mi&s;chiefs which pride had produced, and which adorn a country out of its own &s;poils. England has erected no churches, no ho&s;pitals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The paltry foundation at Calcutta is &s;carcely worth naming as an exception.</NOTE>, no palaces, no &s;chools; England has built no bridges, made no high roads, cut no navigations, dug out no re&s;ervoirs. Every other conqueror of every other de&s;cription has left &s;ome monument, either of &s;tate
<PB N="32" REF="33">
or beneficence, behind him. Were we to be driven out of India this day, nothing would remain, to tell that it had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, during the inglorious period of our dominion, by any thing better than the ouran-outang or the tiger.</P>
<P>There is nothing in the boys we &s;end to India wor&s;e than the boys whom we are whipping at &s;chool, or that we &s;ee trailing a pike, or bending over a de&s;k at home. But as Engli&s;h youth in India drink the intoxicating draught of au|thority and dominion before their heads are able to bear it, and as they are full grown in fortune long before they are ripe in principle, neither nature nor rea&s;on have any opportunity to ex|ert them&s;elves for remedy of the exce&s;&s;es of their premature power. The con&s;equences of their conduct, which in good minds, (and many of theirs are probably &s;uch) might produce penitence or amendment, are unable to pur&s;ue the rapidity of their flight. Their prey is lodged in England; and the cries of India are given to &s;eas and winds, to be blown about, in even break|ing up of the mon&s;oon, over a remote and un|hearing ocean. In India all the vices operate by which &s;udden fortune is acquired; in England are often di&s;played, by the &s;ame per&s;ons, the vir|tues which di&s;pen&s;e hereditary wealth. Arrived in England, the de&s;troyers of the nobility and gentry of a whole kingdom will find the be&s;t company in this nation, at a board of elegance and ho&s;pitality. Here the manufacturer and hu&s;|bandman will ble&s;s the ju&s;t and punctual hand, that in India has torn the cloth from the loom, or wre&s;ted the &s;canty portion of rice and &s;alt from the pea&s;ant of Bengal, or wrung from him the very opium in which he forgot his oppre&s;&s;ions and his oppre&s;&s;or. They marry into your families;
<PB N="33" REF="34">
they enter into your &s;enate; they ea&s;e your e&s;tates by loans; they rai&s;e their value by demand; they cheri&s;h and protect your relations which lie heavy on your patronage; and there is &s;carcely an hou&s;e in the kingdom that does not feel &s;ome concern and intere&s;t that makes all reform of our ea&s;tern government appear officious and di&s;|gu&s;ting; and, on the whole, a mo&s;t di&s;couraging attempt. In &s;uch an attempt you hurt tho&s;e who are able to return kindne&s;s or to re&s;ent injury. If you &s;ucceed, you &s;ave tho&s;e who cannot &s;o much as give you thanks. All the&s;e things &s;hew the difficulty of the work we have on hand: but they &s;hew its nece&s;&s;ity too. Our Indian government is in its be&s;t &s;tate a grievance. It is nece&s;&s;ary that the correctives &s;hould be uncommonly vi|gorous; and the work of men &s;anguine, warm, and even impa&s;&s;ioned in the cau&s;e. But it is an arduous thing to plead again&s;t abu&s;es of a power which originates from your own country, and affects tho&s;e whom we are u&s;ed to con&s;ider as &s;trangers.</P>
<P>I &s;hall certainly endeavour to modulate my&s;elf to this temper; though I am &s;en&s;ible that a cold &s;tyle of de&s;cribing actions which appear to me in a very affecting light, is equally contrary to the ju&s;tice due to the people, and to all genuine hu|man feelings about them. I a&s;k pardon of truth and nature for this compliance. But I &s;hall be very &s;paring of epithets either to per&s;ons or things. It has been &s;aid (and, with regard to one of them, with truth) that Tacitus and Machiavel, by their cold way of relating enormous crimes, have in &s;ome &s;ort appeared not to di&s;approve them; that they &s;eem a &s;ort of profe&s;&s;ors of the art of tyranny, and that they corrupt the minds of their readers by not expre&s;&s;ing the dete&s;tation and horror that naturally belong to horrible and
<PB N="34" REF="35">
dete&s;table proceedings. But we are in ge|neral, Sir, &s;o little acquainted with Indian de|tails; the in&s;truments of oppre&s;&s;ion under which the people &s;uffer are &s;o hard to be under&s;tood; and even the very names of the &s;ufferers are &s;o uncouth and &s;trange to our ears, that it is very difficult for our &s;ympathy to fix upon the&s;e objects. I am &s;ure that &s;ome of us have come down &s;tairs from the committee-room, with im|pre&s;&s;ions on our minds, which to us were the inevitable re&s;ults of our di&s;coveries, yet if we &s;hould venture to expre&s;s our&s;elves in the proper language of our &s;entiments, to other gentlemen not at all prepared to enter into the cau&s;e of them, nothing could appear more har&s;h and di&s;|&s;onant, more violent and unaccountable, than our language and behaviour. All the&s;e circum&s;tances are not, I confe&s;s, very favourable to the idea of our attempting to govern India at all. But there we are; there we are placed by the Sove|reign Di&s;po&s;er: and we mu&s;t do the be&s;t we can in our &s;ituation. The &s;ituation of man is the pre|ceptor of his duty.</P>
<P>Upon the plan which I laid down, and to which I beg leave to return, I was con&s;idering the con|duct of the Company to tho&s;e nations which are indirectly &s;ubject to their authority. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the dependent princes is the Nabob of Oude. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Fox.</NOTE>My Right Honourable friend, to whom we owe the remedial bills on your table, has already pointed out to you, in one of the Re|ports, the condition of that prince, and as it &s;tood in the time he alluded to. I &s;hall only add a few circum&s;tances that may tend to awaken &s;ome &s;en&s;e of the manner in which the condition of the people is affected by that of the prince, and
<PB N="35" REF="36">
involved in it; and to &s;hew you, that when we talk of the &s;ufferings of princes, we do not lament the oppre&s;&s;ion of individuals; and that in the&s;e ca&s;es the high and the low &s;uffer together.</P>
<P>In the year 1779 the Nabob of Oude repre|&s;ented, through the Briti&s;h re&s;ident at his court, that the number of Company's troops &s;tationed in his dominions was a main cau&s;e of his di&s;tre&s;s; and that all tho&s;e which he was not bound by treaty to maintain &s;hould be withdrawn, as they had greatly dimini&s;hed his revenue, and impove|ri&s;hed his country. I will read you, if you plea&s;e, a few extracts from the&s;e repre&s;entations.</P>
<P>He &s;tates
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the country and cultivation are abandoned; and this year in particular, from the exce&s;&s;ive drought of the &s;ea&s;on, deductions of many lacks having been allowed to the far|mers, who are &s;till left un&s;atisfied;"</Q>
and then he proceeds with a long detail of his own di&s;tre&s;s, and that of his family, and all his dependants; and adds,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the new-rai&s;ed brigade is not only quite u&s;ele&s;s to my government, but is more|over the cau&s;e of much lo&s;s, both in revenues and cu&s;toms. The detached body of troops under European officers bring nothing <HI>but confu&s;ion to the affairs of my government, and are entirely their own ma&s;ters.</HI>"</Q>
Mr. Middleton, Mr. Ha&s;|tings's confidential Re&s;ident, vouches for the truth of this repre&s;entation in its fulle&s;t extent.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am concerned to confe&s;s, that there is too good ground for this plea. <HI>The misfortune has been general throughout the whole of the Vizier's</HI> [the Nabob of Oude] <HI>dominions,</HI> obvious to every body; and &s;o <HI>fatal</HI> have been its con&s;equences, that no per&s;on, of either credit or character, would enter into engagements with government
<PB N="36" REF="37">
for farming the country."</Q>
He then proceeds to give &s;trong in&s;tances of the general calamity, and its effects.</P>
<P>It was now to be &s;een what &s;teps the governor general and council took for the relief of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed country, long labouring under the vexa|tions of men, and now &s;tricken by the hand of God. The ca&s;e of a general famine is known to relax the &s;everity even of the mo&s;t rigorous go|vernment.&mdash;Mr. Ha&s;tings does not deny, or &s;hew the lea&s;t doubt of the fact. The repre&s;entation is humble, and almo&s;t abject. On this repre&s;entation from a great prince, of the di&s;tre&s;s of his &s;ubjects, Mr. Ha&s;tings falls into a violent pa&s;&s;ion; &s;uch as (it &s;eems) would be unju&s;tifiable in any one who &s;peaks of any part of <HI>his</HI> conduct. He declares
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the <HI>demands,</HI> the <HI>tone</HI> in which they were a&s;|&s;erted, and the <HI>&s;ea&s;on</HI> in which they were made, are all equally alarming, and appear to him to require an adequate degree of firmne&s;s in this board, in <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> to them."</Q>
He proceeds to deal out very unre&s;erved language, on the per&s;on and character of the Nabob and his mini&s;ters. He de|clares, that in a divi&s;ion between him and the Nabob, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>the &s;tronge&s;t mu&s;t decide.</HI>"</Q> With regard to the urgent and in&s;tant nece&s;&s;ity, from the failure of the crops, he &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that <HI>perhaps</HI> ex|pedients <HI>may be found</HI> for affording a <HI>gradual</HI> relief from the burthen of which he &s;o heavily complains, and it &s;hall be my endeavour to &s;eek them out:"</Q>
and, le&s;t he &s;hould be &s;u&s;|pected of too much ha&s;te to alleviate &s;ufferings, and to remove violence, he &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the&s;e mu&s;t be <HI>gradually</HI> applied, and their complete <HI>effect</HI> may be <HI>di&s;tant</HI>; and this I conceive <HI>is all</HI> he can claim of right."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">This complete effect of his lenity is di&s;tant indeed. Rejecting this demand (as he calls the Nabob's abject &s;upplication) he attributes it, as he u&s;ually does all things of the kind, to the di|vi&s;ion in their government; and &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this is a powerful motive with <HI>me</HI> (however inclined I might be, <HI>upon any other occa&s;ion,</HI> to yield to &s;ome <HI>part</HI> of his demand) to give them an <HI>ab&s;olute and unconditional refu&s;al</HI> upon the pre&s;ent; and even <HI>to bring to puni&s;hment, if my influence can produce that effect, tho&s;e incendiaries who have endeavoured to make them&s;elves the in&s;truments of divi&s;ion between us.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Here, Sir, is much heat and pa&s;&s;ion; but no more con&s;ideration of the di&s;tre&s;s of the country, from a failure of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and (if po&s;&s;ible) the wor&s;e evil of an u&s;ele&s;s and licentious &s;oldiery, than if they were the mo&s;t contemptible of all trifles. A letter is written in con&s;equence, in &s;uch a &s;tyle of lofty de&s;poti&s;m, as I believe has hitherto been unexampled and unheard of in the records of the Ea&s;t. The troops were continued. The <HI>gradual</HI> relief, who&s;e effect was to be &s;o <HI>di&s;|tant,</HI> has <HI>never</HI> been &s;ub&s;tantially and beneficially applied&mdash;and the country is ruined.</P>
<P>Mr. Ha&s;tings, two years after, when it was too late, &s;aw the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a re|moval of the intolerable grievance of this licen|tious &s;oldiery, which, under a pretence of defend|ing it, held the country under military execution. A new treaty and arrangement, according to the plea&s;ure of Mr. Ha&s;tings, took place; and this new treaty was broken in the old manner, in every e&s;&s;ential article. The &s;oldiery were again &s;ent, and again &s;et loo&s;e. The effect of all his ma|noeuvres, from which it &s;eems he was &s;anguine

The Hou&s;e will &s;mile at the re&s;ource on which the Directors take credit as &s;uch a certainty in their curious account.</P>
<P>This is Mr. Ha&s;tings's own narrative of the effects of his own &s;ettlement. This is the &s;tate of the country which we have been told is in perfect peace and order; and, what is curious, he informs us, that <HI>every part of this was foretold to him in the order and manner in which it happened,</HI> at the very time he made his arrangement of men and mea|&s;ures.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="40">The invariable cour&s;e of the Company's policy is this: Either they &s;et up &s;ome prince too odious to maintain him&s;elf without the nece&s;&s;ity of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; or they &s;oon render him odious, by making him the in&s;trument of their govern|ment. In that ca&s;e troops are bountifully &s;ent to him to maintain his authority. That he &s;hould have no want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, a civil gentleman, called a Re&s;ident, is kept at his court, who, un|der pretence of providing duly for the pay of the&s;e troops, gets a&s;&s;ignments on the revenue into his hands. Under his provident management, debts &s;oon accumulate; new a&s;&s;ignments are made for the&s;e debts; until, &s;tep by &s;tep, the whole re|venue, and with it the whole power of the coun|try, is delivered into his hands. The military do not behold without a virtuous emulation the mo|derate gains of the civil department. They feel that, in a country driven to habitual rebellion by the civil government, the military is nece&s;&s;ary; and they will not permit their &s;ervices to go unre|warded. Tracts of country are delivered over to their di&s;cretion. Then it is found proper to convert their commanding officers into farmers of revenue. Thus, between the well paid civil, and well rewarded military e&s;tabli&s;hment, the &s;ituation of the natives may be ea&s;ily conjectured. The authority of the regular and lawful government is every where and in every point extingui&s;hed. Di&s;orders and violences ari&s;e; they are repre&s;&s;ed by other di&s;orders and other violences. Wherever the collectors of the revenue, and the farming colonels and majors move, ruin is about them, rebellion before and behind them. The people in crowds fly out of the country; and the frontier is guarded by lines of troops, not to exclude an
<PB N="40" REF="41">
enemy, but to prevent the e&s;cape of the inha|bitants.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means, in the cour&s;e of not more than four or five years, this once opulent and flouri&s;h|ing country, which, by the accounts given in the Bengal con&s;ultations, yielded more than three crore of Sicca rupees, that is, above three millions &s;ter|ling, annually, is reduced, as far as I can di&s;cover, in a matter purpo&s;ely involved in the utmo&s;t per|plexity, to le&s;s than one million three hundred thou&s;and pounds, and that exacted by every mode of rigour that can be devi&s;ed. To complete the bu&s;ine&s;s, mo&s;t of the wretched remnants of this revenue are mortgaged, and delivered into the hands of the u&s;urers at Benares (for there alone are to be found &s;ome lingering remains of the an|cient wealth of the&s;e regions) at an intere&s;t of near <HI>thirty per cent. per annum.</HI></P>
<P>The revenues in this manner failing, they &s;eized upon the e&s;tates of every per&s;on of emi|nence in the country, and, under the name of <HI>re&s;umption,</HI> confi&s;cated their property. I wi&s;h, Sir, to be under&s;tood univer&s;ally and literally, when I a&s;&s;ert, that there is not left one man of property and &s;ub&s;tance for his rank, in the whole of the&s;e provinces, in provinces which are nearly the extent of England and Wales taken together. Not one landholder, not one banker, not one merchant, not one even of tho&s;e who u&s;ually peri&s;h la&s;t, the <HI>ultimum moriens</HI> in a ruined &s;tate, no one farmer of revenue.</P>
<P>One country for a while remained, which &s;tood as an i&s;land in the mid&s;t of the grand wa&s;te of the Company's dominion. My Right Honour|able friend, in his admirable &s;peech on moving the bill, ju&s;t touched the &s;ituation, the offences, and the puni&s;hment, of a native prince, called

<P>Dr. Swift &s;omewhere &s;ays, that he who could make two blades of gra&s;s grow where but one grew before, was a greater benefactor to the human race than all the politicians that ever exi&s;ted. This prince, who would have been dei|fied by antiquity, who would have been ranked with O&s;iris, and Bacchus, and Ceres, and the divinities mo&s;t propitious to men, was, for tho&s;e very merits, by name attacked by the Company's government, as a cheat, a robber, a traitor. In the &s;ame breath in which he was accu&s;ed as a rebel, he was ordered at once to furni&s;h 5,000 hor&s;e. On delay, or (according to the technical phra&s;e, when any remon&s;trance is made to them) "<HI>on eva&s;ion,</HI>" he was declared a violator of trea|ties, and every thing he had was to be taken from
<PB N="42" REF="43">
him.&mdash;Not one word, however, of hor&s;e in this treaty.</P>
<P>The territory of this Fizulla Kh&acirc;n, Mr. Speaker, is le&s;s than the county of Norfolk. It is an in|land country, full &s;even hundred miles from any &s;ea port, and not di&s;tingui&s;hed for any one con|&s;iderable branch of manufacture what&s;oever. From this territory a punctual payment was made to the Briti&s;h Re&s;ident of &pound;.150,000 &s;terling a year. The demand of cavalry, without a &s;hadow or de|cent pretext of right, amounted to three hundred thou&s;and a year more, at the lowe&s;t computation; and it is &s;tated, by the la&s;t per&s;on &s;ent to negotiate, as a demand of little u&s;e, if it could be complied with; but that the compliance was impo&s;&s;ible, as it amounted to more than his territories could &s;upply, if there had been no other demand upon him&mdash;four hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds a year from an inland country not &s;o large as Norfolk!</P>
<P>The thing mo&s;t extraordinary was to hear the culprit defend him&s;elf from the imputation of his virtues, as if they had been the blacke&s;t offences. He extenuated the &s;uperior cultivation of his country. He denied its population. He endea|voured to prove that he had often &s;ent back the poor pea&s;ant that &s;ought &s;helter with him.&mdash;I can make no ob&s;ervation on this.</P>
<P>After a variety of extortions and vexations, too fatiguing to you, too di&s;gu&s;ting to me, to go through with, they found
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that they ought to be in a better &s;tate to warrant forcible means;"</Q> they therefore contented them&s;elves with a gro&s;s &s;um of 150,000 pounds, for their pre&s;ent demand.
They offered him indeed an indemnity from their
<PB N="43" REF="44">
exactions in future, for three hundred thou&s;and pounds more. But he refu&s;ed to buy their &s;ecu|rities; pleading (probably with truth) his poverty: but if the plea were not founded, in my opinion very wi&s;ely; not choo&s;ing to deal any more in that dangerous commodity of the Company's faith; and thinking it better to oppo&s;e di&s;tre&s;s and un|armed ob&s;tinacy to uncoloured exaction, than to &s;ubject him&s;elf to be con&s;idered as a cheat, if he &s;hould make a treaty in the lea&s;t beneficial to him|&s;elf. Thus they executed an exemplary puni&s;hment on Fizulla Kh&acirc;n for the culture of his country. But, con&s;cious that the prevention of evils is the great object of all good regulation, they deprived him of the means of encrea&s;ing that criminal cul|tivation in future, by exhau&s;ting his coffers; and, that the population of his country &s;hould no more be a &s;tanding reproach and libel on the Company's government, they bound him, by a po&s;itive engagement, not to afford any &s;helter what&s;oever to the farmers and labourers who &s;hould &s;eek refuge in his territories, from the exactions of the Briti&s;h Re&s;idents in Oude. When they had done all this effectually, they gave him a full and complete acquittance from all charges of rebellion, or of any intention to rebel, or of his having originally had any intere&s;t in, or any means of rebellion.</P>
<P>The&s;e intended rebellions are one of the Com|pany's &s;tanding re&s;ources. When money has been thought to be heaped up any where, its owners are univer&s;ally accu&s;ed of rebellion, until they are acquitted of their money and their trea|&s;ons at once. The money once taken, all accu|&s;ation, trial, and puni&s;hment ends. It is &s;o &s;ettled a re&s;ource, that I rather wonder how it comes to be omitted in the Directors account;
<PB N="44" REF="45">
but I take it for granted this omi&s;&s;ion will be &s;upplied in their next edition. The Company &s;tretched this re&s;ource to the full extent, when they accu&s;ed two old women, in the remote&s;t corner of India (who could have no po&s;&s;ible view or motive to rai&s;e di&s;turbances) of being engaged in rebellion, with an intent to drive out the Engli&s;h nation in who&s;e protection, purcha&s;ed by money and &s;ecured by treaty, re&s;ted the &s;ole hope of their exi&s;tence. But the Company wanted money, and the old women <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be guilty of a plot. They were accu&s;ed of rebellion, and they were convicted of wealth. Twice had great &s;ums been extorted from them, and as often had the Briti&s;h faith guaranteed the remainder. A body of Briti&s;h troops, with one of the military farmers general at their head, was &s;ent to &s;eize upon the ca&s;tle in which the&s;e helple&s;s women re&s;ided. Their chief eunuchs, who were their agents, their guardians, protectors, per&s;ons of high rank ac|cording to the Ea&s;tern manners and of great tru&s;t, were thrown into dungeons, to make them di&s;cover their hidden trea&s;ures; and there they lie at pre&s;ent. The lands a&s;&s;igned for the main|tenance of the women were &s;eized and confi&s;|cated. Their jewels and effects were taken, and &s;et up to a pretended auction in an ob&s;cure place, and bought at &s;uch a price as the gentlemen thought proper to give. No account has ever been tran&s;mitted of the articles or produce of this &s;ale. What money was obtained is un|known, or what terms were &s;tipulated for the maintenance of the&s;e de&s;poiled and forlorn crea|tures; for by &s;ome particulars it appears as if an engagement of the kind was made.</P>
<P>Let me here remark, once for all, that though
<PB N="45" REF="46">
the act of 1773 requires that an account of all proceedings &s;hould be diligently tran&s;mitted, that this, like all the other injunctions of the law, is totally de&s;pi&s;ed; and that half at lea&s;t of the mo&s;t important papers are intentionally withheld.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you, Sir, to advert particularly, in this tran&s;action, to the quality and the numbers of the per&s;ons &s;poiled, and the in&s;trument by whom that &s;poil was made. The&s;e ancient matrons called the Begums or Prince&s;&s;es, were of the fir&s;t birth and quality in India, the one mother, the other wife, of the late Nabob of Oude, Sujah Dowlah, a prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of exten&s;ive and flou|ri&s;hing dominions, and the &s;econd man in the Mogul empire. This prince (&s;u&s;picious, and not unju&s;tly &s;u&s;picious, of his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or) at his death committed his trea&s;ures and his fa|mily to the Briti&s;h faith. That family and hou&s;hold, con&s;i&s;ted of <HI>two thou&s;and women</HI>; to which were added two other &s;eraglios of near kindred, and &s;aid to be extremely nu|merous, and (as I am well informed) of about four&s;core of the Nabob's children, with all the eunuchs, the ancient &s;ervants, and a multitude of the dependants of his &s;plendid court. The&s;e were all to be provided, for pre&s;ent maintenance and future e&s;tabli&s;hment, from the lands a&s;&s;igned as dower, and from the trea&s;ures which he left to the&s;e matrons, in tru&s;t for the whole family.</P>
<P>So far as to the objects of the &s;poil. The <HI>in&s;trument</HI> cho&s;en by Mr. Ha&s;tings to de&s;poil the relict of Sujah Dowlah was <HI>her own &s;on,</HI> the reigning Nabob of Oude. It was the pious hand of a &s;on that was &s;elected to tear from his mother and grandmother the provi&s;ion of their age, the maintenance of his brethren, and of
<PB N="46" REF="47">
all the ancient hou&s;ehold of his father. [Here a laugh from &s;ome young members]&mdash;The laugh is <HI>&s;ea&s;onable,</HI> and the occa&s;ion decent and proper.</P>
<P>By the la&s;t advices &s;omething of the &s;um ex|torted remained unpaid. The women in de|&s;pair refu&s;e to deliver more, unle&s;s their lands are re&s;tored and their mini&s;ters relea&s;ed from pri&s;on: but Mr. Ha&s;tings and his council, &s;teady to their point, and con&s;i&s;tent to the la&s;t in their conduct, write to the Re&s;ident to &s;timulate the &s;on to accompli&s;h the filial acts he had brought &s;o near to their perfection.&mdash;"We de&s;ire,"
&s;ay they in their letter to the Re&s;ident (written &s;o late as March la&s;t)
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that you will inform us if any, and what means, have been taken for recovering the balance due from the Begum [Prince&s;s] at Fizabad; and that, if nece&s;&s;ary, you <HI>recommend</HI> it to the Vizier to enforce <HI>the mo&s;t effectual means</HI> for that pur|po&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>What their effectual means of enforcing de|mands on women of high rank and condition are, I &s;hall &s;hew you, Sir, in a few minutes; when I repre&s;ent to you another of the&s;e plots and rebellions, which <HI>always,</HI> in India, though &s;o <HI>rarely</HI> any where el&s;e, are the offspring of an ea&s;y condition, and hoarded riches.</P>
<P>Benares is the capital city of the Indian reli|gion. It is regarded as holy by a particular and di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;anctity; and the Gent&ucirc;s in general think them&s;elves as much obliged to vi&s;it it once in their lives as the Mahometans to perform their pilgrimage to Mecca. By this means that city grew great in commerce and opulence; and &s;o effectually was it &s;ecured by the pious veneration
<PB N="47" REF="48">
of that people, that in all wars and in all violences of power, there was &s;o &s;ure an a&s;ylum, both for poverty and wealth, (as it were under a divine protection) that the wi&s;e&s;t laws and be&s;t a&s;&s;ured free con&s;titution could not better provide for the relief of the one, or the &s;afety of the other; and this tranquillity influenced to the greate&s;t degree the pro&s;perity of all the country, and the terri|tory of which it was the capital. The intere&s;t of money there was not more than half the u&s;ual rate in which it &s;tood in all other places. The reports have fully informed you of the means and of the terms in which this city and the territory called Gazipour, of which it was the head, came under the &s;overeignty of the Ea&s;t India Company.</P>
<P>If ever there was a &s;ubordinate dominion plea|&s;antly circum&s;tanced to the &s;uperior power, it was this; a large rent or tribute, to the amount of two hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds a year, was paid in monthly in&s;talments with the punctuality of a dividend at the Bank. If ever there was a prince who could not have an intere&s;t in di&s;turb|ances, it was its &s;overeign, the Rajah Cheit Sing. He was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capital of his religion, and a willing revenue was paid by the devout people who re&s;orted to him from all parts. His &s;overeignty and his independence, except his tri|bute, was &s;ecured by every tie. His territory was not much le&s;s than half of Ireland, and di&s;played in all parts a degree of cultivation, ea&s;e, and plenty, under his frugal and paternal management, which left him nothing to de&s;ire, either for honour or &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>This was the light in which this country ap|peared to almo&s;t every eye. But Mr. Ha&s;tings beheld it a&s;kance. Mr. Ha&s;tings tells us that it
<PB N="48" REF="49">
was <HI>reported</HI> of this Cheit Sing, that his father left him a million &s;terling, and that he made annual acce&s;&s;ions to the hoard. Nothing could be &s;o ob|noxious to indigent power. So much wealth could not be innocent. The Hou&s;e is fully ac|quainted with the unfounded and unju&s;t requi&s;i|tions which were made upon this prince. The que&s;tion has been mo&s;t ably and conclu&s;ively cleared up in one of the Reports of the Select Com|mittee, and in an an&s;wer of the Court of Directors to an extraordinary publication again&s;t them by their &s;ervant, Mr. Ha&s;tings. But I mean to pa&s;s by the&s;e exactions, as if they were perfectly ju&s;t and regular; and, having admitted them, I take what I &s;hall now trouble you with, only as it &s;erves to &s;hew the &s;pirit of the Company's govern|ment, the mode in which it is carried on, and the maxims on which it proceeds.</P>
<P>Mr. Ha&s;tings, from whom I take the doctrine, endeavours to prove that Cheit Sing was no &s;o|vereign prince; but a mere Zemindar or common &s;ubject, holding land by rent. If this be granted to him, it is next to be &s;een under what terms he is of opinion &s;uch a land-holder, that is a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, holds his life and property under the Company's government. It is proper to under|&s;tand well the doctrines of the per&s;on who&s;e ad|mini&s;tration has lately received &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed approbation from the Company. His doctrine is&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the Company, or the <HI>per&s;on delegated by it,</HI> holds <HI>an ab&s;olute</HI> authority over &s;uch Zemindars;&mdash;that he [&s;uch a &s;ubject] owes <HI>an implicit</HI> and <HI>unre&s;erved</HI> obedience to its authority, at the <HI>forfeiture</HI> even of his <HI>life</HI> and <HI>property,</HI> at the DISCRETION of tho&s;e who held <HI>or fully repre&s;ented</HI> the &s;overeign authority;&mdash;and that <HI>the&s;e</HI> rights are <HI>fully</HI> delegated <HI>to him</HI> Mr. Ha&s;tings."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50">Such is a Briti&s;h governor's idea of the condi|tion of a great Zemindar holding under a Briti&s;h authority; and this kind of authority he &s;uppo&s;es fully delegated to <HI>him</HI>; though no &s;uch delegation appears in any commi&s;&s;ion, in&s;truction, or act of parliament. At his <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> he may demand, of the &s;ub&s;tance of any Zemindar over and above his rent or tribute, even what he plea&s;es, with a &s;overeign authority; and if he does not yield an <HI>implicit unre&s;erved</HI> obedience to all his commands, he forfeits his lands, his life, and his property, at Mr. Ha&s;tings's <HI>di&s;cretion.</HI> But, extravagant and even frantic as the&s;e po&s;itions appear, they are le&s;s &s;o than what I &s;hall now read to you; for he a&s;&s;erts, that if any one &s;hould urge an exemption from more than a &s;tated payment, or &s;hould con&s;ider the deeds, which pa&s;&s;ed be|tween him and the board,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as bearing <HI>the quality and force</HI> of a treaty between equal &s;tates,"</Q>
he &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that &s;uch an opinion is it&s;elf criminal to the &s;tate of which he is a &s;ubject; and that he was him&s;elf amenable to its ju&s;tice, if he gave <HI>coun|tenance</HI> to &s;uch a <HI>belief.</HI>"</Q>
Here is a new &s;pecies of crime invented, that of countenancing a be|lief&mdash;but a belief of what? A belief of that which the Court of Directors, Ha&s;tings's ma&s;|ters, and a Committee of this Hou&s;e, have de|cided as this prince's indi&s;putable right.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing the Rajah of Benares to be a mere &s;ubject, and that &s;ubject a criminal of the highe&s;t form; let us &s;ee what cour&s;e was taken by an upright Engli&s;h magi&s;trate. Did he cite this culprit before his tribunal? Did he make a charge? Did he produce witne&s;&s;es? The&s;e are not forms; they are parts of &s;ub&s;tantial and eternal ju&s;tice. No, not a word of all this. Mr. Ha&s;tings concludes him, <HI>in his own mind,</HI> to be
<PB N="50" REF="51">
guilty; he makes this conclu&s;ion on reports, on hear-&s;ays, on appearances, on rumours, on con|jectures, on pre&s;umptions; and even the&s;e never once hinted to the party, nor publicly to any hu|man being, till the whole bu&s;ine&s;s was done.</P>
<P>But the governor tells you his motive for this extraordinary proceeding, &s;o contrary to every mode of ju&s;tice towards either a prince or a &s;ubject, fairly and without di&s;gui&s;e; and he puts into your hands the key of his whole conduct:&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I will &s;uppo&s;e, for a moment, that I have acted with unwarrantable rigour towards Cheit Sing, and even with inju&s;tice.&mdash;Let my MOTIVE be con|&s;ulted. I left Calcutta, impre&s;&s;ed with a belief that <HI>extraordinary means</HI> were nece&s;&s;ary, and tho&s;e exerted with a <HI>&s;teady hand,</HI> to pre&s;erve the Company's <HI>intere&s;ts from &s;inking under the ac|cumulated weight which oppre&s;&s;ed them.</HI> I &s;aw a <HI>political nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for curbing the <HI>overgrown</HI> power of a great member of their dominion, and for <HI>making it contribute to the relief of their pre&s;&s;ing exigencies.</HI>"</Q>
This is plain &s;peaking; after this it is no wonder that the Rajah's wealth and his offence, the nece&s;&s;ities of the judge, and the opulence of the delinquent, are never &s;epa|rated, through the whole of Mr. Ha&s;tings's apolo|gy.

<P>Crimes &s;o convenient, crimes &s;o politic, crimes &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, crimes &s;o alleviating of di&s;tre&s;s, can never be wanting to tho&s;e who u&s;e no proce&s;s, and who produce no proofs.</P>
<P>But there is another &s;erious part (what is not &s;o?) in this affair. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that the power, for which Mr. Ha&s;tings contends, a power which no &s;overeign ever did, or ever can ve&s;t in any of his &s;ubjects, namely, his own &s;overeign authority, to be conveyed by the act of parliament to any man or body of men what&s;oever; it certainly was never given to Mr. Ha&s;tings. The powers given by the act of 1773 were formal and official; they were given, not to the governor general, but to the major vote of the board, as a board, on di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion among&s;t them&s;elves, in their public cha|racter and capacity; and their acts in that charac|ter and capacity were to be a&s;certained by re|cords and minutes of council. The de&s;potic acts exerci&s;ed by Mr. Ha&s;tings were done merely in his <HI>private</HI> character; and, if they had been moderate and ju&s;t, would &s;till be the acts of an u&s;urped au|thority, and without any one of the legal modes of proceeding which could give him competence for the mo&s;t trivial exertion of power. There was no propo&s;ition or deliberation what&s;oever in coun|cil, no minute on record, by circulation or other|wi&s;e, to authorize his proceedings. No delega|tion of power to impo&s;e a fine, or to take any &s;tep
<PB N="52" REF="53">
to deprive the Rajah of Benares of his government, his property, or his liberty. The minutes of con&s;ultation a&s;&s;ign to his journey a totally dif|ferent object, duty, and de&s;tination. Mr. Whe|ler, at his de&s;ire, tells us long after, that he had a confidential conver&s;ation with him on various &s;ubjects, of which this was the principal, in which Mr. Ha&s;tings notified to him his &s;ecret intentions;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and that he <HI>be&s;poke</HI> his &s;upport of the mea&s;ures which he intended to pur&s;ue towards him (the Rajah.)"</Q>
This confidential di&s;cour&s;e, and <HI>be|&s;peaking</HI> of &s;upport, could give him no power, in oppo&s;ition to an expre&s;s act of parliament, and the whole tenor of the orders of the Court of Di|rectors.</P>
<P>In what manner the powers thus u&s;urped were employed, is known to the whole world. All the Hou&s;e knows, that the de&s;ign on the Rajah proved as unfruitful as it was violent. The unhappy prince was expelled, and his more unhappy coun|try was en&s;laved and ruined; but not a rupee was acquired. In&s;tead of trea&s;ure to recruit the Company's finances, wa&s;ted by their wanton wars and corrupt jobbs, they were plunged into a new war, which &s;hook their power in India to its foundation; and, to u&s;e the governor's own happy &s;imile, might have di&s;&s;olved it like a magic &s;tructure, if the tali&s;man had been broken.</P>
<P>But the &s;ucce&s;s is no part of my con&s;ideration, who &s;hould think ju&s;t the &s;ame of this bu&s;ine&s;s, if the &s;poil of one Rajah had been fully acquired, and faithfully applied to the de&s;truction of twenty other Rajahs. Not only the arre&s;t of the Rajah in his palace was unnece&s;&s;ary and unwarrantable, and calculated to &s;tir up any manly blood which re|mained in his &s;ubjects; but the de&s;potic &s;tyle,
<PB N="53" REF="54">
and the extreme in&s;olence of language and demeanour, u&s;ed to a per&s;on of great condition among the polite&s;t people in the world, was in|tolerable. Nothing aggravates tyranny &s;o much as contumely. <HI>Quicquid &s;uperbia in contumeliis</HI> was charged by a great man of antiquity, as a prin|cipal head of offence again&s;t the governor general of that day. The unhappy people were &s;till more in&s;ulted. A relation, but an <HI>enemy</HI> to the family, a notorious robber and villain, called U&s;&s;aun Sing, kept as a hawk in a mew, to fly upon this nation, was &s;et up to govern there, in&s;tead of a prince honoured and beloved. But when the bu&s;ine&s;s of in&s;ult was accompli&s;hed, the revenue was too &s;erious a concern to be entru&s;ted to &s;uch hands. Another was &s;et up in his place, as guardian to an infant.</P>
<P>But here, Sir, mark the effect of all the&s;e <HI>extra|ordinary</HI> means, of all this policy and ju&s;tice. The revenues which had been hitherto paid with &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing punctuality, fell into arrear. The new prince guardian was depo&s;ed without cere|mony; and with as little, ca&s;t into pri&s;on. The government of that once happy country has been in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion ever &s;ince &s;uch good order was taken about it. But, to complete the contumely offered to this undone people, and to make them feel their &s;ervitude in all its degradation, and all its bitterne&s;s, the govern|ment of their &s;acred city, the government of that Benares which had been &s;o re&s;pected by Per&s;ian and Tartar conquerors, though of the Mu&s;&s;ul|man per&s;ua&s;ion, that, even in the plenitude of their pride, power, and bigotry, no magi&s;trate of that &s;ect entered the place, was now delivered over
<PB N="54" REF="55">
by Engli&s;h hands to a Mahometan; and an Ali Ibrahim Kh&acirc;n was introduced, under the Compa|ny's authority, with power of life and death, into the &s;anctuary of the Gent&ucirc; religion.</P>
<P>After this, the taking off a &s;light payment, chearfully made by pilgrims to a chief of their own rites, was repre&s;ented as a mighty benefit. It remains only to &s;hew, through the conduct in this bu&s;ine&s;s, the &s;pirit of the Company's govern|ment, and the re&s;pect they pay towards other pre|judices not le&s;s regarded in the Ea&s;t than tho&s;e of religion; I mean the reverence paid to the female &s;ex in general, and particularly to women of high rank and condition. During the general confu&s;ion of the country of Gazypore, Panna, the mother of Cheit Sing, was lodged with her train in a ca&s;tle called Bidg&eacute; Gur, in which were likewi&s;e depo&s;ited a large portion of the trea&s;ures of her &s;on, or more probably her own. To whom&s;oever they be|longed was indifferent; for, though no charge of rebellion was made on this woman (which was rather &s;ingular, as it would have co&s;t nothing) they were re&s;olved to &s;ecure her with her fortune. The ca&s;tle was be&s;ieged by Major Popham.</P>
<P>There was no great rea&s;on to apprehend that &s;oldiers ill paid, that &s;oldiers who thought they had been defrauded of their plunder on former &s;ervices of the &s;ame kind, would not have been &s;ufficiently attentive to the &s;poil they were ex|pre&s;sly come for; but the gallantry and gene|ro&s;ity of the profe&s;&s;ion was ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected, as being likely to &s;et bounds to military rapaciou&s;|ne&s;s. The Company's fir&s;t civil magi&s;trate di&s;|covered the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s le&s;t the women &s;hould have any thing pre&s;erved to them. Terms,

a &s;uppliant to the dome&s;tic &s;ervant of Mr. Ha&s;|tings (they are his own words that I read);

The dreadful &s;ecret hinted at by the merciful governor in the latter part of the letter, is well under&s;tood in India; where tho&s;e who
<PB N="57" REF="58">
&s;uffer corporeal indignities, generally expiate the offences of others with their own blood. However, in &s;pite of all the&s;e, the temper of the military did, &s;ome way or other, operate. They came to terms which have never been tran&s;mitted. It appears that a fifteenth <HI>per cent.</HI> of the plunder was re&s;erved to the captives, of which the unhappy mother of the prince of Benares was to have a &s;hare. This antient matron, born to better things [a laugh from certain young gentlemen]&mdash;I &s;ee no cau&s;e for this mirth. A good author of antiquity reckons among the calamities of his time, <HI>Nobili&s;&s;imarum foemi|narum exilia et fugas.</HI> I &s;ay, Sir, this antient lady was compelled to quit her hou&s;e with three hun|dred helple&s;s women, and a multitude of children in her train; but the lower &s;ort in the camp it &s;eems could not be re&s;trained. They did not for|get the good le&s;&s;ons of the governor general. They were unwilling
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to be defrauded of a con|&s;iderable part of their booty, by &s;uffering them to pa&s;s without examination."</Q>
&mdash;They examined them, Sir, with a vengeance, and the &s;acred protec|tion of that awful character, Mr. Ha&s;tings's maitre d'hotel, could not &s;ecure them from in&s;ult and plunder. Here is Popham's narrative of the affair:&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Ranny came out of the fort, with her family and dependants, the 10th at night, owing to which &s;uch attention was not paid to her as I wi&s;hed; and I am exceedingly &s;orry to inform you, that the <HI>licentiou&s;ne&s;s of our followers was beyond the bounds of con|troul; for, notwith&s;tanding all I could do, her people were plundered on the road of mo&s;t of the things which they brought out of the fort, by which means one of the articles of &s;urrender</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="59">
<HI>has been much infringed.</HI> The di&s;tre&s;s I have felt upon this occa&s;ion cannot be expre&s;&s;ed, and can only be allayed by a firm performance of the other articles of the treaty, which I &s;hall make it my bu&s;ine&s;s to enforce."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The &s;u&s;picions which the officers had of trea|chery, and the delay made to our getting po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, had enraged them, as well as the troops, &s;o much, that the treaty was at fir&s;t regarded as void, but this determination was &s;oon &s;uc|ceeded by pity and compa&s;&s;ion for the unfor|tunate be&s;ieged."</Q>
&mdash;After this comes, in his due order, Mr. Ha&s;tings; who is full of &s;orrow and indignation, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. according to the be&s;t and mo&s;t authentic precedents e&s;tabli&s;hed upon &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The women being thus di&s;po&s;ed of, that is, completely de&s;poiled, and pathetically lament|ed, Mr. Ha&s;tings at length recollected the great object of his enterprize, which, during his zeal le&s;t the officers and &s;oldiers &s;hould lo&s;e any part of their reward, he &s;eems to have forgot; that is to &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to draw from the Rajah's guilt the means of relief to the Company's di&s;tre&s;&s;es."</Q>
This was to be the &s;trong hold of his defence. This compa&s;&s;ion to the Company, he knew by expe|rience would &s;anctify a great deal of rigour to|wards the natives. But the military had di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their own, which they con&s;idered fir&s;t. Neither Mr. Ha&s;tings's authority, nor his &s;upplications, could prevail on them to a&s;&s;ign a &s;hilling to the claim he made on the part of the Company. They divided the booty among&s;t them&s;elves. Driven from his claim he was reduced to petition for the &s;poil as a loan. But the &s;oldiers were too
<PB N="59" REF="60">
wi&s;e to venture as a loan, what the borrower claimed as a right. In defiance of all authority, they &s;hared among&s;t them&s;elves about two hun|dred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, be&s;ides what had been taken from the women.</P>
<P>In all this there is nothing wonderful. We may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that when the maxims of any government e&s;tabli&s;h among its re&s;ources extra|ordinary means, and tho&s;e exerted with a &s;trong hand, that &s;trong hand will provide tho&s;e extra|ordinary means for <HI>it&s;elf.</HI> Whether the &s;oldiers had rea&s;on or not (perhaps much might be &s;aid for them) certain it is, the military di&s;cipline of India was ruined from that moment; and the &s;ame rage for plunder, the &s;ame contempt of &s;ubordi|nation, which bla&s;ted all the hopes of extraor|dinary means from your &s;trong hand at Benares, have very lately lo&s;t you an army in My&s;ore. This is vi&s;ible enough from the accounts in the la&s;t Gazette.</P>
<P>There is no doubt but that the country and city of Benares, now brought into the &s;ame order, will very &s;oon exhibit, if it does not already di&s;|play the &s;ame appearance with tho&s;e countries and cities which are under better &s;ubjection. A great ma&s;ter, Mr. Ha&s;tings, has him&s;elf been at the pains of drawing a picture of one of the&s;e countries, I mean the province and city of Far|ruckabad. There is no rea&s;on to que&s;tion his knowledge of the facts; and his authority (on this point at lea&s;t) is above all exception, as well for the &s;tate of the country, as for the cau&s;e. In his minute of con&s;ultation, Mr. Ha&s;tings de&s;cribes forcibly the con&s;equences which ari&s;e from the degradation into which we have &s;unk the native government.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The total want (&s;ays he) of all
<PB N="60" REF="61">
order, regularity, or authority, in his (the Nabob of Farruckabad's) government, and to which, among other obvious cau&s;es, it may no doubt be owing that the country of Farruckabad is become <HI>almo&s;t an entire wa&s;te, without culti|vation or inhabitants</HI>; that the capital, which, but a very &s;hort time ago, was di&s;tingui&s;hed as one of the mo&s;t populous and opulent com|mercial cities in Hindo&s;tan, at pre&s;ent exhibits nothing but <HI>&s;cenes of the mo&s;t wretched poverty, de&s;olation, and mi&s;ery</HI>; and that the <HI>Nabob him&s;elf,</HI> tho' in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a tract of country which, with only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">mmon care, is notoriou&s;ly capable of yielding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> annual revenue of be|tween thirty and forty lacks, (three or four hundred thou&s;and pounds) with <HI>no military e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> to maintain, &s;carcely commands <HI>the means of a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tance.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>This is a true and unexaggerated picture, not only of Farruckabad, but of at lea&s;t three-fourths of the country which we po&s;&s;e&s;s, or rather lay wa&s;te, in India. Now, Sir, the Hou&s;e will be de|&s;irous to know for what purpo&s;e this picture was drawn. It was for a purpo&s;e, I will not &s;ay laudable, but nece&s;&s;ary, that of taking the un|fortunate Prince and his country out of the hands of a &s;eque&s;trator &s;ent thither by the Nabob of Oude, the mortal enemy of the Prince thus ruined, and to protect him by means of a Briti&s;h Re&s;ident, who might carry his complaints to the &s;uperior Re&s;ident at Oude, or tran&s;mit them to Calcutta. But mark, how the reformer per|&s;i&s;ted in his reformation. The effect of the mea|&s;ure was better than was probably expected. The Prince began to be at ea&s;e; the country began to recover; and the revenue began to be
<PB N="61" REF="62">
collected. The&s;e were alarming circum&s;tances. Mr. Ha&s;tings not only recalled the Re&s;ident, but he entered into a formal &s;tipulation with the Nabob of Oude, never to &s;end an Engli&s;h &s;ubject again to Farruckabad; and thus the country, de|&s;cribed as you have heard by Mr. Ha&s;tings, is given up for ever to the very per&s;ons to whom he had attributed its ruin, that is to the Sezawals or &s;eque&s;trators of the Nabob of Oude.</P>
<P>Such was the i&s;&s;ue of the fir&s;t attempt to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the dependent provinces. I &s;hall clo&s;e what I have to &s;ay on the condition of the northern dependencies, with the effect of the la&s;t of the&s;e attempts. You will recollect, Sir, the ac|count I have not long ago &s;tated to you as given by Mr. Ha&s;tings, of the ruined condition of the de&s;troyer of others, the Nabob of Oude, and of the recal, in con&s;equence, of Hannay, Middleton, and John&s;on. When the fir&s;t little &s;udden gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t the&s;e gentlemen was &s;pent, the &s;entiments of old friend&s;hip began to revive. Some healing conferences were held between them and the &s;uperior government. Mr. Hannay was per|mitted to return to Oude; but death prevented the further advantages intended for him, and the future benefits propo&s;ed for the country by the provident care of the council general.</P>
<P>The&s;e three gentlemen were accu&s;ed of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t peculations. The Court of Directors were informed, by the governor general and council, that a &s;evere enquiry would be in&s;tituted again&s;t the two &s;urvivors; and they reque&s;ted that court to &s;u&s;pend its judgment, and to wait the event of their proceedings. But no enquiry has been in&s;tituted, nor any &s;teps taken towards it. By means of the bland and conciliatory di&s;po&s;itions of the charter
<PB N="62" REF="63">
governors, and proper private explanations, the public enquiry has died away, the &s;uppo&s;ed pecu|lators and de&s;troyers of Oude repo&s;e in all &s;ecurity in the bo&s;oms of their accu&s;ers; whil&s;t others &s;uc|ceed to them to be in&s;tructed by their example.</P>
<P>It is only to complete the view I propo&s;ed of the conduct of the Company, with regard to the dependent provinces, that I &s;hall &s;ay <HI>any</HI> thing at all of the Carnatic, which is the &s;cene, if po&s;|&s;ible, of greater di&s;order than the northern pro|vinces. Perhaps it were better to &s;ay of this center and metropolis of abu&s;e, whence all the re&s;t in India and in England diverge; from whence they are fed and methodized, what was &s;aid of Carthage&mdash;<HI>de Carthagine &s;atius e&s;t &s;ilere quam parum dicere.</HI> This country, in all its de|nominations, is about 46,000 &s;quare miles. It may be affirmed univer&s;ally, that not one per&s;on of &s;ub&s;tance or property, landed, commercial, or mo|nied, excepting two or three bankers, who are ne|ce&s;&s;ary depo&s;its and di&s;tributors of the general &s;poil, is left in all that region. In that country the moi&s;ture, the bounty of Heaven, is given but at a certain &s;ea&s;on. Before the aera of our influence, the indu&s;try of man carefully hu&s;banded that gift of God. The Gent&ucirc;s pre&s;erved, with a pro|vident and religious care, the precious depo&s;it of the periodical rain in re&s;ervoirs, many of them works of royal grandeur; and from the&s;e, as occa&s;ion demanded, they fructified the whole country. To maintain the&s;e re&s;ervoirs, and to keep up an annual advance to the cultivators, for &s;eed and cattle, formed a principal object of the piety and policy of the prie&s;ts and rulers of the Gent&ucirc; religion.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64">This object required a command of money; and there was no Pollam, or ca&s;tle, which in the happy days of the Carnatic was without &s;ome hoard of trea&s;ure, by which the governors were enabled to combat with the irregularity of the &s;ea&s;ons, and to re&s;i&s;t or to buy off the inva&s;ion of an enemy. In all the cities were multitudes of merchants and bankers, for all occa&s;ions of mo|nied a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and on the other hand, the native princes were in condition to obtain credit from them. The manufacturer was paid by the return of commodities, or by imported money, and not, as at pre&s;ent, in the taxes that had been originally exacted from his indu&s;try. In aid of ca&s;ual di&s;tre&s;s, the country was full of choultries, which were inns and ho&s;pitals, where the traveller and the poor were relieved. All ranks of people had their place in the public concern, and their &s;hare in the common &s;tock and common pro&s;perity; but <HI>the chartered rights of men,</HI> and the right which it was thought proper to &s;et up in the Nabob of Arcot, introduced a new &s;y&s;tem. It was their policy to con&s;ider hoards of money as crimes; to regard moderate rents as frauds on the &s;overeign; and to view, in the le&s;&s;er princes, any claim of exemption from more than &s;ettled tribute, as an act of rebellion. Accordingly all the ca&s;tles were, one after the other, plundered and de&s;troyed. The native princes were expelled; the ho&s;pitals fell to ruin; the re&s;ervoirs of water went to decay; the merchants, bankers, and manufacturers di&s;appeared; and &s;terility, indi|gence, and depopulation, over&s;pread the face of the&s;e once flouri&s;hing provinces.</P>
<P>The Company was very early &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e mi&s;chiefs, and of their true cau&s;e. They gave preci&s;e
<PB N="64" REF="65">
orders,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the native princes, called Polygars, &s;hould <HI>not be extirpated.</HI>&mdash;That the rebellion [&s;o they choo&s;e to call it] of the Polygars, may (they fear) <HI>with too much ju&s;tice,</HI> be attributed to the mal-admini&s;tration of the Nabob's collectors."</Q>
That

They might have u&s;ed a &s;tronger expre&s;&s;ion with|out impropriety. But they make amends in an|other place. Speaking of the Polygars, the Di|rectors &s;ay, that

They &s;tate, that the wars in which he has involved the Carnatic, had been a cau&s;e of its di&s;tre&s;&s;es.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es have been certainly great; but tho&s;e by <HI>the Nabob's oppre&s;&s;ions</HI> we believe <HI>to be greater than all.</HI>"</Q>
Pray, Sir, attend to the rea&s;on for their opinion that the govern|ment of this their in&s;trument is more cala|mitous to the country than the ravages of war.&mdash;Becau&s;e, &s;ay they, his oppre&s;&s;ions are

From this &s;tore nei|ther he nor they could derive any advantage what|&s;oever, upon the inva&s;ion of Hyder Ali in the hour of their greate&s;t calamity and di&s;may.</P>
<P>It is now proper to compare the&s;e declarations with the Company's conduct. The principal rea|&s;on which they a&s;&s;igned again&s;t the <HI>extirpation</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="66">
of the Polygars was, that the <HI>weavers</HI> were pro|tected in their fortre&s;&s;es. They might have added, that the Company it&s;elf, which &s;tung them to death, had been warmed in the bo&s;om of the&s;e unfortunate princes: for, on the taking of Madras by the French, it was in their ho&s;pitable Pollams, that mo&s;t of the inhabitants found refuge and pro|tection. But, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e orders, rea|&s;ons, and declarations, they at length gave an in|direct &s;anction, and permitted the u&s;e of a very direct and irre&s;i&s;tible force, to mea&s;ures which they had, over and over again, declared to be fal&s;e policy, cruel, inhuman, and oppre&s;&s;ive. Having, however, forgot all attention to the princes and the people, they remembered that they had &s;ome &s;ort of intere&s;t in the trade of the country; and it is matter of curio&s;ity to ob&s;erve the protection which they afforded to this their natural object.</P>
<P>Full of anxious cares on this head, they direct,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that in reducing the Polygars they (their &s;er|vants) were to be <HI>cautious,</HI> not to deprive the <HI>weavers and manufacturers</HI> of the protection they often met with in the &s;trong holds of the Polygar countries;"</Q>&mdash;and they write to their in&s;trument, the Nabob of Arcot, concerning the&s;e poor people in a mo&s;t pathetic &s;train.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We <HI>en|treat</HI> your Excellency (&s;ay they) in particular, to make the manufacturers the object of your <HI>tendere&s;t care</HI>; particularly when you <HI>root out</HI> the Polygars, you do not deprive the <HI>weavers of the protection they enjoyed under them.</HI>"</Q>
When they root out the protectors in favour of the oppre&s;&s;or, they &s;hew them&s;elves religiou&s;ly cau|tious of the rights of the protected. When they extirpate the &s;hepherd and the &s;hepherd's dogs, they piou&s;ly recommend the helple&s;s flock to the

mercy, and even to the <HI>tendere&s;t care,</HI> of the wolf, This is the uniform &s;train of their policy, &s;trictly forbidding, and at the &s;ame time &s;trenuou&s;ly encouraging and enforcing, every mea&s;ure that can ruin and de&s;olate the country committed to their charge. After giving the Company's idea of the government of this their in&s;trument, it may appear &s;ingular, but it is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with their &s;y&s;tem, that, be&s;ides wa&s;ting for him, at two different times, the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;pot upon the earth, Tanjour, and all the adjacent countries, they have even voluntarily put their own ter|ritory, that is, a large and fine country adjacent to Madras, called their Jaghire, wholly out of their protection; and have continued to farm their &s;ubjects, and their duties towards the&s;e &s;ubjects, to that very Nabob, whom they them|&s;elves con&s;tantly repre&s;ent as an habitual oppre&s;&s;or, and a relentle&s;s tyrant. This they have done without any pretence of ignorance of the objects of oppre&s;&s;ion for which this prince has thought fit to become their renter; for he has again and again told them, that it is for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of exerci&s;ing authority he holds the Jaghire lands; and he affirms (and I believe with truth) that he pays more for that territory than the revenues yield. This deficiency he mu&s;t make up from his other territories; and thus, in order to fur|ni&s;h the means of oppre&s;&s;ing one part of the Car|natic, he is led to oppre&s;s all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e perceives that the livery of the Com|pany's government is uniform. I have de&s;cribed the condition of the countries indirectly, but mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantially, under the Company's authority.

<PB N="67" REF="68">
vote to continue, upon any principles of pre|tended public faith, the management of the&s;e countries in tho&s;e hands. If I kept &s;uch a faith (which in reality is no better than a <HI>fides latronum</HI>) with what is called the Company, I mu&s;t break the faith, the covenant, the &s;olemn, original, indi&s;pen|&s;able oath, in which I am bound, by the eternal frame and con&s;titution of things, to the whole human race.</P>
<P>As I have dwelt &s;o long on the&s;e who are in|directly under the Company's admini&s;tration, I will endeavour to be a little &s;horter upon the countries immediately under this charter govern|ment.&mdash;The&s;e are the Bengal provinces. The condition of the&s;e provinces is pretty fully de|tailed in the Sixth and Ninth Reports, and in their Appendixes. I will &s;elect only &s;uch principles and in&s;tances as are broad and general. To your own thoughts I &s;hall leave it, to furni&s;h the detail of oppre&s;&s;ions involved in them. I &s;hall &s;tate to you, as &s;hortly as I am able, the conduct of the Company;&mdash;1&s;t, towards the landed intere&s;ts;&mdash;next, the commercial intere&s;ts;&mdash;3dly, the na|tive government;&mdash;and la&s;tly, to their own go|vernment.</P>
<P>Bengal, and the provinces that are united to it, are larger than the kingdom of France; and once contained, as France does contain, a great and independent landed intere&s;t, compo&s;ed of princes, of great lords, of a numerous nobility and gentry, of freeholders, of lower tenants, of religious communities, and public foundations. So early as 1769, the Company's &s;ervants perceived the decay into which the&s;e provinces had fallen under Engli&s;h admini&s;tration, and they made a &s;trong repre&s;entation upon this decay, and what they
<PB N="68" REF="69">
apprehended to be the cau&s;es of it. Soon after Mr. Ha&s;tings became pre&s;ident of Bengal. In&s;tead of admini&s;tering a remedy, upon the heels of a dread|ful famine, in the year 1772, the &s;uccour which the new pre&s;ident and the council lent to this afflicted nation was&mdash;&s;hall I be believed in relat|ing it?&mdash;the landed intere&s;t of a whole kingdom, of a kingdom to be compared to France, was &s;et up to public auction! They &s;et up (Mr. Ha&s;tings &s;et up) the whole nobility, gentry, and freeholders, to the highe&s;t bidder. No preference was given to the ancient proprietors. They mu&s;t bid again&s;t every u&s;urer, every temporary adventurer, every jobber and &s;chemer, every &s;ervant of every Eu|ropean, or they were obliged to content them|&s;elves, in lieu of their exten&s;ive domains, with their hou&s;e, and &s;uch a pen&s;ion as the &s;tate auctioneers thought fit to a&s;&s;ign. In this general calamity, &s;everal of the fir&s;t nobility thought (and in all appearance ju&s;tly) that they had better &s;ub|mit to the nece&s;&s;ity of this pen&s;ion, than continue, under the name of Zemindars, the objects and in|&s;truments of a &s;y&s;tem, by which they ruined their tenants, and were ruined them&s;elves. Another reform has &s;ince come upon the back of the fir&s;t; and a pen&s;ion having been a&s;&s;igned to the&s;e un|happy per&s;ons, in lieu of their hereditary lands, a new &s;cheme of oeconomy has taken place, and deprived them of that pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The menial &s;ervants of Engli&s;hmen, per&s;ons (to u&s;e the emphatical phra&s;e of a ruined and patient Ea&s;tern chief

Mr. Ha&s;tings's banian was, after this auction, found po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of territories yielding a rent of one hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds a year.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70">Such an univer&s;al pro&s;cription, upon any pre|tence, has few examples. Such a pro&s;cription, without even a pretence of delinquency, has none. It &s;tands by it&s;elf. It &s;tands as a mo|nument to a&s;toni&s;h the imagination, to confound the rea&s;on of mankind. I confe&s;s to you, when I fir&s;t came to know this bu&s;ine&s;s in its true nature and extent, my &s;urpri&s;e did a little &s;u&s;pend my indignation. I was in a manner &s;tupified by the de&s;perate boldne&s;s of a few ob&s;cure young men, who having obtained, by ways which they could not comprehend, a power of which they &s;aw nei|ther the purpo&s;es nor the limits, to&s;&s;ed about, &s;ubverted, and tore to pieces, as if it were in the gambols of a boyi&s;h unluckine&s;s and malice, the mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed rights, and the mo&s;t an|cient and mo&s;t revered in&s;titutions, of ages and nations. Sir, I will not now trouble you with any detail with regard to what they have &s;ince done with the&s;e &s;ame lands and land-holders; only to inform you, that nothing has been &s;uffered to &s;ettle for two &s;ea&s;ons together upon any ba&s;is; and that the levity and incon&s;tancy of the&s;e mock legi&s;lators were not the lea&s;t afflicting parts of the oppre&s;&s;ions &s;uffered under their u&s;ur|pation; nor will any thing give &s;tability to the pro|perty of the natives, but an admini&s;tration in Eng|land at once protecting and &s;table. The country &s;u&s;tains, almo&s;t every year, the mi&s;eries of a revo|lution. At pre&s;ent, all is uncertainty, mi&s;ery, and confu&s;ion. There is to be found through the&s;e va&s;t regions no longer one landed man, who is a re&s;ource for voluntary aid, or an object for particular rapine. Some of them were, not long &s;ince, great princes; they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed trea&s;ures, they levied armies. There was a Zemindar in Bengal (I forget his name) that, on the threat of an inva&s;ion, &s;upplied the Soubah of the&s;e provinces with the loan of a

million &s;terling. The family this day wants credit for a breakfa&s;t at the bazar.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now &s;ay a word or two on the Com|pany's care of the commercial intere&s;t of tho&s;e kingdoms. As it appears in the Reports, that per&s;ons in the highe&s;t &s;tations in Bengal have adopted, as a fixed plan of policy, the de&s;truction of all intermediate dealers between the Company and the manufacturer, native merchants have di&s;|appeared of cour&s;e. The &s;poil of the revenues is the &s;ole capital which purcha&s;es the produce and manufactures; and through three or four foreign companies tran&s;mits the official gains of indi|viduals to Europe. No other commerce has an exi&s;tence in Bengal. The tran&s;port of its plunder is the only traffic of the country. I wi&s;h to refer you to the Appendix to the Ninth Report for a full account of the manner in which the Company have protected the commercial intere&s;ts of their dominions in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the native government and the admini&s;tra|tion of ju&s;tice, it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in a poor tottering man|ner for &s;ome years. In the year 1781, a total revo|lution took place in that e&s;tabli&s;hment. In one of the u&s;ual freaks of legi&s;lation of the council of Ben|gal, the whole criminal juri&s;diction of the&s;e courts, called the Phoujdary Judicature, exerci&s;ed till then by the principal Mu&s;&s;ulmen, was in one day, with|out notice, without con&s;ultation with the magi&s;trates or the people there, and without communication with the directors or mini&s;ters here, totally &s;ub|verted. A new in&s;titution took place, by which this juri&s;diction was divided between certain Engli&s;h &s;ervants of the Company and the Gent&ucirc; Zemindars of the country, the latter of whom ne|ver petitioned for it, nor, for ought that appears, ever de&s;ired this boon. But its natural u&s;e was
<PB N="71" REF="72">
made of it; it was made a pretence for new extortions of money.</P>
<P>The natives had however one con&s;olation in the ruin of their judicature; they &s;oon &s;aw that it fared no better with the Engli&s;h government it&s;elf. That too, after de&s;troying every other, came to its period. This revolution may well be rated for a mo&s;t daring act, even among the ex|traordinary things that have been doing in Bengal &s;ince our unhappy acqui&s;ition of the means of &s;o much mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>An e&s;tabli&s;hment of Engli&s;h government for civil ju&s;tice, and for the collection of revenue, was planned and executed by the pre&s;ident and council of Bengal, &s;ubject to the plea&s;ure of the Directors, in the year 1772. According to this plan, the country was divided into &s;ix great di&s;tricts, or provinces. In each of the&s;e was e&s;tabli&s;hed a provincial council, which admini&s;|tered the revenue; and of that council one mem|ber, by monthly rotation, pre&s;ided in the courts of civil re&s;ort; with an appeal to the council of the province, and thence to Calcutta. In this &s;y&s;tem (whether, in other re&s;pects, good or evil) there were &s;ome capital advantages. There was in the very number of per&s;ons in each provincial council, authority, communication, mutual check, and controul. They were obliged, on their mi|nutes of con&s;ultation, to enter their rea&s;ons and di&s;&s;ents; &s;o that a man of diligence, of re&s;earch, and tolerable &s;agacity, &s;itting in London, might, from the&s;e materials, be enabled to form &s;ome judgment of the &s;pirit of what was going on on the furthe&s;t banks of the Ganges and Burramp&ucirc;ter.</P>
<P>The Court of Directors &s;o far ratified this e&s;tabli&s;hment, (which was con&s;onant enough to their general plan of government) that they gave
<PB N="72" REF="73">
preci&s;e orders, that no alteration &s;hould be made in it, without their con&s;ent. So far from being appri&s;ed of any de&s;ign again&s;t this con&s;ti|tution, they had rea&s;on to conceive that on trial it had been more and more approved by their council general, at lea&s;t by the governor general, who had planned it. At the time of the revolu|tion, the council general was nominally in two per&s;ons, virtually in one. At that time mea&s;ures of an arduous and critical nature ought to have been forborne, even if, to the fulle&s;t council, this &s;pecific mea&s;ure had not been prohibited by the &s;uperior authority. It was in this very &s;ituation, that one man had the hardine&s;s to conceive, and the temerity to execute, a total revolution in the form and the per&s;ons compo&s;ing the government of a great kingdom. Without any previous &s;tep, at one &s;troke, the whole con&s;titution of Bengal, civil and criminal, was &s;wept away. The coun|&s;ellors were recalled from their provinces. Up|wards of fifty of the principal officers of go|vernment were turned out of employ, and rendered dependent on Mr. Ha&s;tings for their immediate &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and for all hope of future provi&s;ion. The chief of each council, and one European col|lector of revenue, was left in each province.</P>
<P>But here, Sir, you may imagine a new govern|ment, of &s;ome permanent de&s;cription, was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the place of that which had been thus &s;uddenly overturned. No &s;uch thing. Le&s;t the&s;e chiefs without councils &s;hould be conceived to form the ground plan of &s;ome future government, it was publicly declared, that their continuance was only temporary and permi&s;&s;ive. The whole &s;ubordinate Briti&s;h admini&s;tration of revenue was then ve&s;ted in a committee in Calcutta, all
<PB N="73" REF="74">
creatures of the governor general; and the pro|vincial management, under the permi&s;&s;ive chief, was delivered over to native officers.</P>
<P>But, that the revolution, and the purpo&s;es of the revolution, might be complete, to this committee were delegated, not only the func|tions of all the inferior, but, what will &s;urprize the Hou&s;e, tho&s;e of the &s;upreme admini&s;tra|tion of revenue al&s;o. Hitherto the governor general and council had, in their revenue de|partment, admini&s;tered the finances of tho&s;e king|doms. By the new &s;cheme they are delegated to this committee, who are only to report their pro|ceedings for approbation.</P>
<P>The key to the whole tran&s;action is given in one of the in&s;tructions to the committee,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that it is not nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould enter di&s;|&s;ents."</Q>
By this means the ancient plan of the Company's admini&s;tration was de&s;troyed; but the plan of concealment was perfected. To that moment the accounts of the revenues were tolerably clear; or at lea&s;t means were furni&s;hed for enquiries, by which they might be rendered &s;atisfactory. In the ob&s;cure and &s;ilent gulph of this committee every thing is now buried. The thicke&s;t &s;hades of night &s;urround all their tran&s;actions. No ef|fectual means of detecting fraud, mi&s;manage|ment, or mi&s;repre&s;entation, exi&s;t. The Directors, who have dared to talk with &s;uch confidence on their revenues, know nothing about them. What u&s;ed to fill volumes is now compri&s;ed under a few dry heads on a &s;heet of paper. The natives, a people habitually made to con|cealment, are the chief managers of the reve|nue thoughout the provinces. I mean by na|tives, &s;uch wretches as your rulers &s;elect out of them as mo&s;t fitted for their purpo&s;es. As a
<PB N="74" REF="75">
proper key-&s;tone to bind the arch, a native, one Gunga Govind Sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, a man turned out of his em|ployment by Sir John Clavering, for malver&s;ation in office, is made the corre&s;ponding &s;ecretary; and indeed the great moving principle of their new board.</P>
<P>As the whole revenue and civil admini&s;tration was thus &s;ubverted, and a clande&s;tine govern|ment &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of it, the judicial in&s;titution underwent a like revolution. In 1772 there had been &s;ix courts formed out of the &s;ix provincial councils. Eighteen new ones are appointed in their place, with each a judge, taken from the <HI>junior</HI> &s;ervants of the Company. To maintain the&s;e eighteen courts, a tax is le|vied on the &s;ums in litigation, of 2 &frac12; <HI>per cent.</HI> on the great, and of 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> on the le&s;s. This money is all drawn from the provinces to Cal|cutta. The chief ju&s;tice (the &s;ame who &s;tays in defiance of a vote of this Hou&s;e, and of His Ma|je&s;ty's recal) is appointed at once the trea&s;urer and di&s;po&s;er of the&s;e taxes, levied, without any &s;ort of authority, from the Company, from the Crown, or from Parliament.</P>
<P>In effect, Sir, every legal regular authority in matters of revenue, of political admini&s;tration, of criminal law, of civil law, in many of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of military di&s;cipline, is laid level with the ground; and an oppre&s;&s;ive, irregular, capricious, un&s;teady, rapacious, and peculating de&s;poti&s;m, with a direct di&s;avowal of obedience to any authority at home, and without any fixed maxim, principle, or rule of proceeding, to guide them in India, is at pre&s;ent the &s;tate of your charter-government over great kingdoms.</P>
<P>As the Company has made this u&s;e of their tru&s;t, I &s;hould ill di&s;charge mine, if I refu&s;ed to
<PB N="75" REF="76">
give my mo&s;t chearful vote for the redre&s;s of the&s;e abu&s;es, by putting the affairs of &s;o large and valuable a part of the intere&s;ts of this nation and of mankind, into &s;ome &s;teady hands, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the confidence, and a&s;&s;ured of the &s;upport of this Hou&s;e, until they can be re&s;tored to regularity, order, and con&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>I have touched the heads of &s;ome of the grievances of the people, and the abu&s;es of go|vernment. But I hope and tru&s;t, you will give me credit, when I faithfully a&s;&s;ure you, that I have not mentioned one fourth part of what has come to my knowledge in your committee; and further, I have full rea&s;on to believe, that not one fourth part of the abu&s;es are come to my knowledge, by that or by any other means. Pray con&s;ider what I have &s;aid only as an in|dex to direct you in your enquiries.</P>
<P>If this then, Sir, has been the u&s;e made of the tru&s;t of political powers internal and external, given by you in the charter, the next thing to be &s;een is the conduct of the Company with regard to the commercial tru&s;t. And here I will make a fair offer:&mdash;If it can be proved that they have acted wi&s;ely, prudently, and frugally, as merchants, I &s;hall pa&s;s by the whole ma&s;s of their enormities as &s;tate&s;men. That they have not done this their pre&s;ent condition is proof &s;ufficient. Their di&s;tre&s;&s;es are &s;aid to be owing to their wars. This is not wholly true. But if it were, is not that readine&s;s to engage in wars which di&s;tingui&s;hes them, and for which the Committee of Secrecy has &s;o branded their politics, founded on the fal&s;e&s;t principles of mer|cantile &s;peculation?</P>
<P>The principle of buying cheap and &s;elling dear is the fir&s;t, the great foundation of mercantile
<PB N="76" REF="77">
dealing. Have they ever attended to this prin|ciple? Nay, for years have they not actually authorized in their &s;ervants a total indifference as to the prices they were to pay?</P>
<P>A great deal of &s;trictne&s;s in driving bargains for whatever we contract, is another of the prin|ciples of mercantile policy. Try the Company by that te&s;t! Look at the contracts that are made for them. Is the Company &s;o much as a good commi&s;&s;ary to their own armies? I en|gage to &s;elect for you, out of the innumerable ma&s;s of their dealings, all conducted very nearly alike, one contract only, the exce&s;&s;ive profits on which during a &s;hort term would pay the whole of their year's dividend. I &s;hall undertake to &s;hew, that upon two others, that the inordi|nate profits given, with the lo&s;&s;es incurred in order to &s;ecure tho&s;e profits, would pay a year's dividend more.</P>
<P>It is a third property of trading men, to &s;ee that their clerks do not divert the dealings of the ma&s;ter to their own benefit. It was the other day only, when their governor and coun|cil taxed the Company's inve&s;tment with a &s;um of fifty thou&s;and pounds, as an inducement to per&s;uade only &s;even members of their board of trade to give their <HI>honour</HI> that they would ab|&s;tain from &s;uch profits upon that inve&s;tment as they mu&s;t have violated their <HI>oaths</HI> if they had made at all.</P>
<P>It is a fourth quality of a merchant to be exact in his accounts. What will be thought, when you have fully before you the mode of accounting made u&s;e of in the trea&s;ury of Ben|gal?&mdash;I hope you will have it &s;oon. With re|gard to one of their agencies, when it came to the material part, the prime co&s;t of the
<PB N="77" REF="78">
goods on which a commi&s;&s;ion of fifteen <HI>per cent.</HI> was allowed, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the factory to whom the commodities were &s;ent, the accountant general reports that he did not think him&s;elf authorized to call for <HI>vouchers</HI> relative to this and other particulars,&mdash;becau&s;e the agent was upon his <HI>honour</HI> with regard to them. A new principle of account upon honour &s;eems to be regularly e&s;tabli&s;hed in their dealings and their trea&s;ury, which in reality amounts to an entire annihilation of the principle of all accounts.</P>
<P>It is a fifth property of a merchant, who does not meditate a fraudulent bankruptcy, to calcu|late his probable profits upon the money he takes up to ve&s;t in bu&s;ine&s;s. Did the Company, when they bought goods on bonds bearing 8 <HI>per cent.</HI> in|tere&s;t, at ten and even twenty <HI>per cent.</HI> di&s;count, even a&s;k them&s;elves a que&s;tion concerning the po&s;&s;i|bility of advantage from dealing on the&s;e terms?</P>
<P>The la&s;t quality of a merchant I &s;hall advert to, is the taking care to be properly prepared, in ca&s;h or goods, in the ordinary cour&s;e of &s;ale, for the bills which are drawn on them. Now I a&s;k, whether they have ever calculated the clear pro|duce of any given &s;ales, to make them tally with the four million of bills which are come and coming upon them, &s;o as at the proper periods to enable the one to liquidate the other? No, they have not. They are now obliged to borrow money of their own &s;ervants to purcha&s;e their inve&s;t|ment. The &s;ervants &s;tipulate five <HI>per cent.</HI> on the capital they advance, if their bills &s;hould not be paid at the time when they become due; and the value of the rupee on which they charge this intere&s;t is taken at two &s;hillings and a penny. Has the Company ever troubled them|&s;elves to enquire whether their &s;ales can bear the
<PB N="78" REF="79">
payment of that intere&s;t, and at that rate of ex|change? Have they once con&s;idered the dilemma in which they are placed&mdash;the ruin of their credit in the Ea&s;t Indies, if they refu&s;e the bills&mdash;the ruin of their credit and exi&s;tence in England, if they ac|cept them? Indeed no trace of equitable government is found in their politics; not one trace of com|mercial principle in their mercantile dealing; and hence is the deepe&s;t and matured wi&s;dom of Par|liament demanded, and the be&s;t re&s;ources of this kingdom mu&s;t be &s;trained, to re&s;tore them; that is, to re&s;tore the countries de&s;troyed by the mi&s;|conduct of the Company, and to re&s;tore the Com|pany it&s;elf, ruined by the con&s;equences of their plans for de&s;troying what they were bound to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>I required, if you remember, at my out&s;et a proof that the&s;e abu&s;es were habitual. But &s;urely this it is not nece&s;&s;ary for me to con&s;ider as a &s;eparate head; becau&s;e I tru&s;t I have made it evident beyond a doubt, in con&s;idering the abu&s;es them&s;elves, that they are regular, permanent, and &s;y&s;tematical.</P>
<P>I am now come to my la&s;t condition, without which, for one, I will never readily lend my hand to the de&s;truction of any e&s;tabli&s;hed government; which is, That in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, the government of the Ea&s;t India Company is ab&s;olutely incor|rigible.</P>
<P>Of this great truth I think there can be little doubt, after all that has appeared in this Hou&s;e. It is &s;o very clear, that I mu&s;t con&s;ider the leaving any power in their hands, and the determined re&s;olution to continue and counte|nance every mode and every degree of peculation, oppre&s;&s;ion, and tyranny, to be one and the &s;ame thing. I look upon that body incorrigible, from the fulle&s;t con&s;ideration both of their uniform
<PB N="79" REF="80">
conduct, and their pre&s;ent real and virtual con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>If they had not con&s;tantly been apprized of all the enormities committed in India under their authority; if this &s;tate of things had been as much a di&s;covery to them as it was to many of us; we might flatter our&s;elves that the de|tection of the abu&s;es would lead to their refor|mation. I will go further: If the Court of Di|rectors had not uniformly condemned every act which this Hou&s;e or any of its Committees had condemned; if the language in which they ex|pre&s;&s;ed their di&s;approbation again&s;t enormities and their authors had not been much more vehement and indignant than any ever u&s;ed in this Hou&s;e, I &s;hould entertain &s;ome hopes. If they had not, on the other hand, as uniformly commended all their &s;ervants who had done their duty and obeyed their orders, as they had heavily cen&s;ured tho&s;e who rebelled; I might &s;ay, The&s;e people have been in an error, and when they are &s;en&s;ible of it they will mend. But when I reflect on the uniformity of their &s;upport to the objects of their uniform cen&s;ure; and the &s;tate of in&s;ignificance and di&s;|grace to which all of tho&s;e have been reduced whom they approved; and that even utter ruin and premature death have been among the fruits of their favour; I mu&s;t be convinced, that in this ca&s;e, as in all others, hypocri&s;y is the only vice that never can be cured.</P>
<P>Attend, I pray you, to the &s;ituation and pro&s;|perity of Benfield, Ha&s;tings, and others of that &s;ort. The la&s;t of the&s;e has been treated by the company with an a&s;perity of reprehen&s;ion that has no parallel. They lament,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the power of di&s;|po&s;ing of their property for perpetuity, &s;hould fall into &s;uch hands."</Q>
Yet for fourteen years,

with little interruption, he has governed all their af|fairs, of every de&s;cription, with an ab&s;olute &s;way. He has had him&s;elf the means of heaping up im|men&s;e wealth; and, during that whole period, the fortunes of hundreds have depended on his &s;miles and frowns. He him&s;elf tells you he is incum|bered with two hundred and fifty young gentle|men, &s;ome of them of the be&s;t families in Eng|land, all of whom aim at returning with va&s;t fortunes to Europe in the prime of life.

He domineers with an overbearing &s;way in the a&s;&s;emblies of his pretended ma&s;ters; and it is thought in a degree ra&s;h to venture to name his offences in this Hou&s;e, even as grounds of a legi&s;lative remedy.</P>
<P>On the other hand, con&s;ider the fate of tho&s;e who have met with the applau&s;es of the Directors. Colonel Mon&s;on, one of the be&s;t of men, had his days &s;hortened by the applau&s;es, de&s;titute of the &s;upport, of the Company. General Clavering, who&s;e panegyric was made in every di&s;patch from England, who&s;e hear&s;e was bedewed with the tears, and hung round with eulogies of the Court of Directors, bur&s;t an hone&s;t and indig|nant heart at the treachery of tho&s;e who ruined him by their prai&s;es. Uncommon patience and temper, &s;upported Mr. Francis a while longer under the baneful influence of the commen|dation of the Court of Directors. His health however gave way at length; and, in utter de&s;pair
<PB N="81" REF="82">
he returned to Europe. At his return the doors of the India Hou&s;e were &s;hut to this man, who had been the object of their con&s;tant admiration. He has indeed e&s;caped with life, but he has for|feited all expectation of credit, con&s;equence, party, and following. He may well &s;ay, <HI>Me nemo mi|ni&s;tro fur erit, atque ideo nulli comes exeo.</HI> This man, who&s;e deep reach of thought, who&s;e large legi&s;|lative conceptions, and who&s;e grand plans of po|licy, make the mo&s;t &s;hining part of our Reports, from whence we have all learned our le&s;&s;ons, if we have learned any good ones; this man, from who&s;e materials tho&s;e gentlemen who have lea&s;t acknow|ledged it have yet &s;poken as from a brief; this man, driven from his employment, di&s;counte|nanced by the Directors, has had no other reward, and no other di&s;tinction, but that inward

He has not yet had &s;o much as a good word, but from a per&s;on too in&s;ignificant to make any other return for the means with which he has been furni&s;hed for per|forming his &s;hare of a duty which is equally urgent on us all.</P>
<P>Add to this, that from the highe&s;t in place to the lowe&s;t, every Briti&s;h &s;ubject, who, in obe|dience to the Company's orders, has been active in the di&s;covery of peculations, has been ruined. They have been driven from India. When they made their appeal at home they were not heard; when they attempted to return they were &s;topped. No artifice of fraud, no violence of power, has been omitted, to de&s;troy them in character as well as in fortune.</P>
<P>Wor&s;e, far wor&s;e, has been the fate of the poor creatures, the natives of India, whom the hypo|cri&s;y of the Company has betrayed into complaint
<PB N="82" REF="83">
of oppre&s;&s;ion, and di&s;covery of peculation. The fir&s;t woman in Bengal, the Ranni of Raje&s;hahi, the Ranni of Burdwan, the Ranni of Amboa, by their weak and thoughtle&s;s tru&s;t in the Company's honour and protection, are utterly ruined: the fir&s;t of the&s;e women, a per&s;on of princely rank, and once of corre&s;pondent fortune, who paid above two hundred thou&s;and a year quit-rent to the &s;tate, is, according to very credible information, &s;o com|pletely beggared as to &s;tand in need of the relief of alms. Mahomed Reza Kh&acirc;n, the &s;econd Mu&s;&s;ulman in Bengal, for having been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the ill-omened honour of the counte|nance and protection of the Court of Directors, was, without the pretence of any enquiry what&s;o|ever into his conduct, &s;tripped of all his employ|ments, and reduced to the lowe&s;t condition. His ancient rival for power, the Rajah Nundcomar, was, by an in&s;ult on every thing which India holds re&s;pectable and &s;acred, hanged in the face of all his nation, by the judges you &s;ent to protect that people; hanged for a pretended crime, upon an <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> Briti&s;h act of parliament, in the mid&s;t of his evidence again&s;t Mr. Ha&s;tings. The ac|cu&s;er they &s;aw hanged. The culprit, without acquittal or enquiry, triumphs on the ground of that murder: a murder not of Nundcomar only, but of all living te&s;timony, and even of evidence yet unborn. From that time not a complaint has been heard from the natives again&s;t their gover|nors. All the grievances of India have found a complete remedy.</P>
<P>Men will not look to acts of parliament, to re|gulations, to declarations, to votes, and re&s;olu|tions. No, they are not &s;uch fools. They will a&s;k, what is the road to power, credit, wealth, and honours? They will a&s;k, what conduct ends in
<PB N="83" REF="84">
neglect, di&s;grace, poverty, exile, pri&s;on, and gibbet? The&s;e will teach them the cour&s;e which they are to follow. It is your di&s;tribution of the&s;e that will give the character and tone to your go|vernment. All the re&s;t is mi&s;erable grimace.</P>
<P>When I accu&s;e the Court of Directors of this habitual treachery, in the u&s;e of reward and pu|ni&s;hment, I do not mean to include all the indi|viduals in that Court. There have been, Sir, very frequently, men of the greate&s;t integrity and virtue among&s;t them; and the contrariety in the declarations and conduct of that Court has ari&s;en, I take it, from this:&mdash;That the hone&s;t Directors have, by the force of matter of fact on the records, carried the reprobation of the evil mea&s;ures of the &s;ervants in India. This could not be prevented, whil&s;t the&s;e records &s;tared them in the face; nor were the delinquents, either here or there, very &s;olicitous about their reputation, as long as they were able to &s;ecure their power. The agreement of their partizans to cen&s;ure them, blunted for a while the edge of a &s;evere proceed|ing. It obtained for them a character of impar|tiality, which enabled them to recommend, with &s;ome &s;ort of grace, what will always carry a plau|&s;ible appearance, tho&s;e treacherous expedients, called moderate mea&s;ures. Whil&s;t the&s;e were un|der di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, new matter of complaint came over, which &s;eemed to antiquate the fir&s;t. The &s;ame circle was here trod round once more; and thus through years they proceeded in a compromi&s;e of cen&s;ure for puni&s;hment; until, by &s;hame and de|&s;pair, one after another, almo&s;t every man, who preferred his duty to the Company to the inte|re&s;ts of their &s;ervants, has been driven from that Court.</P>
<P>This, Sir, has been their conduct; and it has been the re&s;ult of the alteration which was in&s;en&s;ibly
<PB N="84" REF="85">
made in their con&s;titution. The change was made in&s;en&s;ibly; but it is now &s;trong and adult, and as public and declared, as it is fixed beyond all power of reformation. So that there is none who hears me, that is not as certain as I am, that the Company, in the &s;en&s;e in which it was for|merly under&s;tood, has no exi&s;tence. The que&s;tion is not, what injury you may do to the proprietors of India &s;tock; for there are no &s;uch men to be injured. If the active ruling part of the Company who form the general court, who fill the offices, and direct the mea&s;ures (the re&s;t tell for no|thing) were per&s;ons who held their &s;tock as a means of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, who in the part they took were only concerned in the govern|ment of India, for the ri&s;e or fall of their dividend, it would be indeed a defective plan of policy. The intere&s;t of the people who are governed by them would not be their primary object; perhaps a very &s;mall part of their con&s;i|deration at all. But then they might well be depended on, and perhaps more than per&s;ons in other re&s;pects preferable, for preventing the pe|culations of their &s;ervants to their own prejudice. Such a body would not ea&s;ily have left their trade as a &s;poil to the avarice of tho&s;e who received their wages. But now things are totally rever&s;ed. The &s;tock is of no value, whether it be the qua|lification of a director or proprietor; and it is impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould. A director's qualifica|tion may be worth about two thou&s;and five hun|dred pounds&mdash;and the intere&s;t, at eight <HI>per cent.</HI> is about one hundred and &s;ixty pounds a year. Of what value is that, whether it ri&s;e to ten, or fall to &s;ix, or to nothing, to him who&s;e &s;on, before he is in Bengal two months, and before he de|&s;cends the &s;teps of the council chamber, &s;ells the grant of a &s;ingle contract for forty thou&s;and
<PB N="85" REF="86">
pounds? Accordingly the &s;tock is bought up in qualifications. The vote is not to protect the &s;tock, but the &s;tock is bought to acquire the vote; and the end of the vote is to cover and &s;upport, again&s;t ju&s;tice, &s;ome man of power who has made an obnoxious fortune in India; or to maintain in power tho&s;e who are actually employ|ing it in the acqui&s;ition of &s;uch a fortune; and to avail them&s;elves in return of his patronage, that he may &s;hower the &s;poils of the Ea&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"barba|ric pearl and gold,"</Q> on them, their families, and de|pendents. So that all the relations of the Company are not only changed, but inverted. The &s;ervants in India are not appointed by the Directors, but the Directors are cho&s;en by them. The trade is carried on with their capitals. To them the re|venues of the country are mortgaged. The &s;eat of the &s;upreme power is in Calcutta. The hou&s;e in Leadenhall Street is nothing more than a change for their agents, factors, and deputies to meet in, to take care of their affairs, and &s;upport their intere&s;ts; and this &s;o avowedly, that we &s;ee the known agents of the delinquent &s;ervants mar|&s;halling and di&s;ciplining their forces, and the prime &s;poke&s;men in all their a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>Every thing has followed in this order, and ac|cording to the natural train of events. I will clo&s;e what I have to &s;ay on the incorrigible con|dition of the Company, by &s;tating to you a few facts, that will leave no doubt of the ob&s;tinacy of that corporation, and of their &s;trength too, in re|&s;i&s;ting the reformation of their &s;ervants. By the&s;e facts you will be enabled to di&s;cover the &s;ole grounds upon which they are tenacious of their charter. It is now more than two years that, upon account of the gro&s;s abu&s;es and ruinous &s;ituation of the Compa|ny's affairs, (which occa&s;ioned the cry of the whole world long before it was taken up here) that we
<PB N="86" REF="87">
in&s;tituted two Committees to enquire into the mi&s;|managements by which the Company's affairs had been brought to the brink of ruin. The&s;e enqui|ries had been pur&s;ued with unremitting diligence; and a great body of facts was collected and printed for general information. In the re&s;ult of tho&s;e enquiries, although the Committees con&s;i&s;ted of very different de&s;criptions, they were unanimous. They joined in cen&s;uring the conduct of the In|dian admini&s;tration, and enforcing the re&s;pon&s;i|bility upon two men, whom this Hou&s;e, in con|&s;equence of the&s;e reports, declared it to be the duty of the Directors to remove from their &s;ta|tions, and recal to Great Britain,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>becau&s;e they had acted in a manner repugnant to the honour and policy of this nation, and thereby brought great calamities on India, and enormous expences on the Ea&s;t India Company.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Here was no attempt on the charter. Here was no que&s;tion of their privileges. To vindicate their own honour, to &s;upport their own intere&s;ts, to enforce obedience to their own orders; the&s;e were the &s;ole object of the monitory re&s;olution of this Hou&s;e. But as &s;oon as the general court could a&s;&s;emble, they a&s;&s;embled to demon&s;trate who they really were. Regardle&s;s of the proceed|ings of this Hou&s;e, they ordered the Directors not to carry into effect any re&s;olution they might come to for the removal of Mr. Ha&s;tings and Mr. Hornby. The Directors, &s;till retaining &s;ome &s;ha|dow of re&s;pect to this Hou&s;e, in&s;tituted an enquiry them&s;elves, which continued from June to Octo|ber; and after an attentive peru&s;al and full con&s;i|deration of papers, re&s;olved to take &s;teps for re|moving the per&s;ons who had been the objects of our re&s;olution; but not without a violent &s;truggle again&s;t evidence. Seven Directors went &s;o far as to enter a prote&s;t again&s;t the vote of their court.
<PB N="87" REF="88">
Upon this the general court takes the alarm; it re-a&s;&s;embles; it orders the Directors to re&s;cind their re&s;olution, that is, not to recal Mr. Ha&s;tings and Mr. Hornby, and to de&s;pi&s;e the re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e or Commons. Without &s;o much as the pretence of looking into a &s;ingle paper, without the formality of in&s;tituting any committee of en|quiry, they &s;uper&s;eded all the labours of their own Directors, and of this Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It will naturally occur to a&s;k, how it was po&s;&s;i|ble that they &s;hould not attempt &s;ome &s;ort of examination into facts, as a colour for their re&s;i&s;t|ance to a public authority, proceeding &s;o very de|liberately; and exerted, apparently at lea&s;t, in favour of their own? The an&s;wer, and the only an&s;wer which can be given, is, that they were afraid that their true relation &s;hould be mi&s;taken. They were afraid that their patrons and ma&s;ters in India &s;hould attribute their &s;upport of them, to an opinion of their cau&s;e, and not to an attachment to their power. They were afraid it &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected, that they did not mean blindly to &s;up|port them in the u&s;e they made of that power. They determined to &s;hew that they at lea&s;t were &s;et again&s;t reformation; that they were firmly re&s;olved to bring the territories, the trade, and the &s;tock of the Company, to ruin, rather than be wanting in fidelity to their nominal &s;ervants and real ma&s;ters, in the ways they took to their pri|vate fortunes.</P>
<P>Even &s;ince the beginning of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the &s;ame act of audacity was repeated, with the &s;ame circum&s;tances of contempt of all the decorum of enquiry, on their part, and of all the proceedings of this Hou&s;e. They again made it a reque&s;t to their favourite, and your culprit, to keep his po&s;t; and thanked and applauded him, without calling for a paper which could afford light into the
<PB N="88" REF="89">
merit or demerit of the tran&s;action, and with|out giving them&s;elves a moment's time to con|&s;ider, or even to under&s;tand, the articles of the Maratta peace. The fact is, that for a long time there was a &s;truggle, a faint one indeed, between the Company and their &s;ervants. But it is a &s;truggle no longer. For &s;ome time the &s;upe|riority has been decided. The intere&s;ts abroad are become the &s;ettled preponderating weight both in the Court of Proprietors, and the Court of Directors. Even the attempt you have made to enquire into their practices and to reform abu&s;es, has rai&s;ed and piqued them to a far more regular and &s;teady &s;upport. The Company has made a common cau&s;e, and identified them&s;elves, with the de&s;troyers of India. They have taken on them&s;elves all that ma&s;s of enormity; they are &s;upporting what you have reprobated; tho&s;e you condemn they applaud; tho&s;e you order home to an&s;wer for their conduct, they reque&s;t to &s;tay, and thereby encourage to proceed in their practices. Thus the &s;ervants of the Ea&s;t India Company triumph, and the repre&s;entatives of the people of Great Britain are defeated.</P>
<P>I therefore conclude, what you all conclude, that this body, being totally perverted from the purpo&s;es of its in&s;titution, is utterly incorrigible; and becau&s;e they are incorrigible, both in conduct and con&s;titution, power ought to be taken out of their hands; ju&s;t on the &s;ame principles on which have been made all the ju&s;t changes and revolu|tions of government that have taken place &s;ince the beginning of the world.</P>
<P>I will now &s;ay a few words to the general prin|ciple of the plan which is &s;et up again&s;t that of my Right Honourable friend. It is to re-com|mit the government of India to the Court of Directors. Tho&s;e who would commit the refor|mation
<PB N="89" REF="90">
of India to the de&s;troyers of it, are the enemies to that reformation. They would make a di&s;tinction between Directors and Proprietors, which, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, does not, cannot exi&s;t. But a Right Honourable gentleman &s;ays, he would keep the pre&s;ent government of India in the Court of Directors; and would, to curb them, provide &s;alutary regulations;&mdash;wonderful! That is, he would appoint the old offenders to correct the old offences; and he would render the vicious and the fooli&s;h wi&s;e and virtuous, by &s;alutary regulations. He would appoint the wolf as guar|dian of the &s;heep; but he has invented a curious muzzle, by which this protecting wolf &s;hall not be able to open his jaws above an inch or two at the utmo&s;t. Thus his work is fini&s;hed. But I tell the Right Honourable gentleman, that controuled depravity is not innocence; and that it is not the labour of delinquency in chains, that will cor|rect abu&s;es. Will the&s;e gentlemen of the direc|tion animadvert on the partners of their own guilt? Never did a &s;erious plan of amending of any old tyrannical e&s;tabli&s;hment propo&s;e the au|thors and abettors of the abu&s;es as the reformers of them. If the undone people of India &s;ee their old oppre&s;&s;ors in confirmed power, even by the reformation, they will expect nothing but what they will certainly feel, a continuance, or rather an aggravation, of all their former &s;ufferings. They look to the &s;eat of power, and to the per|&s;ons who fill it; and they de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e gentle|men's regulations as much as the gentlemen do who talk of them.</P>
<P>But there is a cure for every thing. Take away, &s;ay they, the Court of Proprietors, and the Court of Directors will do their duty. Yes; as they have done it hitherto. That the evils in India have &s;olely ari&s;en from the Court of Proprietors,
<PB N="90" REF="91">
is gro&s;sly fal&s;e. In many of them, the Directors were heartily concurring; in mo&s;t if them they were encouraging, and &s;ometimes commanding; in all they were conniving.</P>
<P>But who are to choo&s;e this well-regulated and reforming Court of Directors?&mdash;Why, the very proprietors who are excluded from all manage|ment, for the abu&s;e of their power. They will choo&s;e undoubtedly, out of them&s;elves, men like them&s;elves; and tho&s;e who are mo&s;t forward in re&s;i&s;ting your authority, tho&s;e who are mo&s;t en|gaged in faction or intere&s;t with the delinquents abroad, will be the objects of their &s;election. But Gentlemen &s;ay, that when this choice is made, the proprietors are not to interfere in the mea&s;ures of the Directors, whil&s;t tho&s;e Directors are bu&s;y in the control of their common pa|trons and ma&s;ters in India. No, indeed, I believe they will not de&s;ire to interfere. They will choo&s;e tho&s;e whom they know may be tru&s;ted, &s;afely tru&s;ted, to act in &s;trict conformity to their common principles, manners, mea&s;ures, intere&s;ts, and con|nections. They will want neither monitor nor con|trol. It is not ea&s;y to choo&s;e men to act in con|formity to a public intere&s;t again&s;t their private: but a &s;ure dependance may be had on tho&s;e who are cho&s;en to forward their private intere&s;t, at the expence of the public. But if the Directors &s;hould &s;lip, and deviate into rectitude, the puni&s;hment is in the hands of the general court, and it will &s;urely be remembered to them at their next election.</P>
<P>If the government of India wants no reforma|tion; but gentlemen are amu&s;ing them&s;elves with a theory, conceiving a more democratic or ari&s;|tocratic mode of government for the&s;e depen|ances, or if they are in a di&s;pute only about pa|tronage; the di&s;pute is with me of &s;o little con|cern, that I &s;hould not take the pains to utter an
<PB N="91" REF="92">
affirmative or negative to any propo&s;ition in it. If it be only for a theoretical amu&s;ement that they are to propo&s;e a bill; the thing is at be&s;t frivolous and unnece&s;&s;ary. But if the Company's government is not only full of abu&s;e, but is one of the mo&s;t corrupt and de&s;tructive tyrannies, that probably ever exi&s;ted in the world (as I am &s;ure it is) what a cruel mockery would it be in me, and in tho&s;e who think like me, to propo&s;e this kind of remedy for this kind of evil!</P>
<P>I now come to the third objection, That this bill will increa&s;e the influence of the Crown. An Honourable gentleman has demanded of me, whether I was in earne&s;t when I propo&s;ed to this Hou&s;e a plan for the reduction of that influence. Indeed, Sir, I was much, very much, in earne&s;t. My heart was deeply concerned in it; and I hope the public has not lo&s;t the effect of it. How far my judgment was right, for what concerned per|&s;onal favour and con&s;equence to my&s;elf, I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to determine; nor is its effect upon <HI>me</HI> of any moment. But as to this bill, whether it encrea&s;es the influence of the Crown, or not, is a que&s;tion I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to a&s;k. If I am not able to correct a &s;y&s;tem of oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny, that goes to the utter ruin of thirty mil|lions of my fellow-creatures and fellow-&s;ubjects, but by &s;ome increa&s;e to the influence of the Crown, I am ready here to declare, that I, who have been active to reduce it, &s;hall be at lea&s;t as active and &s;trenuous to re&s;tore it again. I am no lover of names; I contend for the &s;ub&s;tance of good and protecting government, let it come from what quarter it will.</P>
<P>But I am not obliged to have recour&s;e to this expedient. Much, very much the contrary. I am &s;ure that the influence of the Crown will by no means aid a reformation of this kind; which
<PB N="92" REF="93">
can neither be originated nor &s;upported, but by the uncorrupt public virtue of the repre&s;entatives of the people of England. Let it once get into the ordinary cour&s;e or admini&s;tration, and to me all hopes of reformation are gone. I am far from knowing or believing, that this bill will encrea&s;e the influence of the Crown. We all know, that the Crown has ever had &s;ome influence in the Court of Directors; and that it has been extremely in|crea&s;ed by the acts of 1773 and 1780. The gen|tlemen who, as part of their reformation, propo&s;e
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a more active controul on the part of the Crown,"</Q> which is to put the Directors under a Secretary of State, &s;pecially named for that pur|po&s;e, mu&s;t know, that their project will increa&s;e it further.
But that old influence has had, and the new will have, incurable inconveniences, which cannot happen under the parliamentary e&s;tabli&s;h|ment propo&s;ed in this bill. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Governor John&s;tone.</NOTE>An Honourable gentleman not now in his place, but who is well acquainted with the India Company, and by no means a friend to this bill, has told you that a mini&s;terial influence has always been predominant in that body; and that to make the Directors pliant to their purpo&s;es, Mini&s;ters generally cau&s;ed per&s;ons meanly qualified to be cho&s;en Directors. According to his idea, to &s;ecure &s;ub&s;erviency, they &s;ubmitted the Company's affairs to the di|rection of incapacity. This was to ruin the Com|pany, in order to govern it. This was certainly influence in the very wor&s;t form in which it could appear. At be&s;t it was clande&s;tine and irre&s;pon|&s;ible. Whether this was done &s;o much upon &s;y&s;|tem as that gentleman &s;uppo&s;es, I greatly doubt. But &s;uch in effect the operation of Government on that court unque&s;tionably was; and &s;uch under a &s;imilar con&s;titution, it will be for ever.
<PB N="93" REF="94">
Mini&s;ters mu&s;t be wholly removed from the management of the affairs of India, or they will have an influence in its patronage. The thing is inevitable. Their &s;cheme of a new Secretary of State,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"with a more vigorous control,"</Q> is not much better than a repetition of the mea&s;ure which we know by experience will not do.
Since the year 1773 and the year 1780, the Company has been under the control of the Secretary of State's office, and we had then three Secretaries of State. If more than this is done, then they annihilate the direction which they pretend to &s;upport; and they augment the influence of the Crown, of who&s;e growth they affect &s;o great an horror. But in truth this &s;cheme of reconciling a direction really and truly deliberative, with an office really and &s;ub&s;tantially controlling, is a &s;ort of machinery that can be kept in order but a very &s;hort time. Either the Directors will dwindle into clerks, or the Secretary of State, as hitherto has been the cour&s;e, will leave every thing to them, often through de&s;ign, often through neglect. If both &s;hould affect activity, colli&s;ion, procra&s;tina|tion, delay, and in the end, utter confu&s;ion mu&s;t en&s;ue.</P>
<P>But, Sir, there is one kind of influence far greater than that of the nomination to office. This gentlemen in oppo&s;ition have totally overlooked, although it now exi&s;ts in its full vigour; and it will do &s;o, upon their &s;cheme, in at lea&s;t as much force as it does now. That influence this bill cuts up by the roots; I mean the <HI>influence of protection.</HI> I &s;hall explain my&s;elf:&mdash;The office given to a young man going to India is of trifling con&s;equence. But he that goes out an in&s;igni|ficant boy, in a few years returns a great Nabob. Mr. Ha&s;tings &s;ays he has two hundred and fifty of that kind of raw materials, who expect to be
<PB N="94" REF="95">
&s;peedily manufactured into the merchantable qua|lity I mention. One of the&s;e gentlemen, &s;up|po&s;e, returns hither, loaded with odium and with riches. When he comes to England he comes as to a pri&s;on or as to a &s;anctuary; and either are ready for him, according to his demeanor. What is the influence in the grant of any place in India, to that which is acquired by the protection or compromi&s;e with &s;uch guilt, and with the command of &s;uch riches, under the domi|nion of the hopes and fears which power is able to hold out to every man in that condition? That man's whole fortune, half a million per|haps, becomes an in&s;trument of influence, without a &s;hilling of charge to the Civil Li&s;t; and the influx of fortunes which &s;tand in need of this protection is continual. It works both ways; it influences the delinquent, and it may cor|rupt the mini&s;ter. Compare the influence ac|quired by appointing for in&s;tance even a go|vernor general, and that obtained by protecting him. I &s;hall pu&s;h this no further. But I wi&s;h gentlemen to roll it a little in their own minds.</P>
<P>The bill before you cuts off this &s;ource of influence. Its de&s;ign and main &s;cope is to re|gulate the admini&s;tration of India upon the prin|ciples of a Court of Judicature; and to exclude, as far as human prudence can exclude, all po&s;|&s;ibility of a corrupt partiality, in appointing to office or &s;upporting in office, or covering from enquiry and puni&s;hment, any per&s;on who has abu&s;ed or &s;hall abu&s;e his authority. At the board, as appointed and regulated by this bill, reward and puni&s;hment cannot be &s;hifted and rever&s;ed by a whi&s;per. That commi&s;&s;ion becomes fatal to cabal, to intrigue, and to &s;ecret repre&s;enta|tion, tho&s;e in&s;truments of the ruin of India.
<PB N="95" REF="96">
He that cuts off the means of premature fortune, and the power of protecting it when acquired, &s;trikes a deadly blow at the great fund, the Bank, the capital &s;tock of Indian influence, which cannot be ve&s;ted any where, or in any hands, without mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences to the public.</P>
<P>The third and contradictory objection, is, That this bill does not increa&s;e the influence of the Crown. On the contrary, That the ju&s;t power of the Crown will be le&s;&s;ened, and transferred to the u&s;e of a party, by giving the patronage of India to a commi&s;&s;ion nominated by par|liament, and independent of the Crown. The contradiction is glaring, and it has been too well expo&s;ed to make it nece&s;&s;ary for me to in&s;i&s;t upon it. But pa&s;&s;ing the contradiction, and taking it without any relation, of all objections that is the mo&s;t extraordinary. Do not gentlemen know, that the Crown has not at pre&s;ent the grant of a &s;ingle office under the Company, civil or military, at home or abroad? So far as the Crown is concerned, it is certainly rather a gainer; for the vacant offices in the new com|mi&s;&s;ion are to be filled up by the King.</P>
<P>It is argued as a part of the bill, derogatory to the prerogatives of the Crown, that the commi&s;&s;ioners named in the bill are to continue for a &s;hort term of years (too &s;hort in my opinion) and becau&s;e, during that time, they are not at the mercy of every predominant faction of the court. Does not this objection lie again&s;t the pre&s;ent Directors; none of whom are named by the Crown, and a proportion of whom hold for this very term of four years? Did it not lie again&s;t the governor general and council named in the act of 1773&mdash;who were inve&s;ted by name, as the pre&s;ent commi&s;&s;ioners are to be ap|pointed
<PB N="96" REF="97">
in the body of the act of parliament, who were to hold their places for a term of years, and were not removable at the di&s;cretion of the Crown? Did it not lie again&s;t the re|appointment, in the year 1780, upon the very &s;ame terms? Yet at none of the&s;e times, what|ever other objections the &s;cheme might be liable to, was it &s;uppo&s;ed to be a derogation to the ju&s;t prerogative of the Crown, that a commi&s;&s;ion created by act of parliament &s;hould have its members named by the authority which called it into exi&s;tence? This is not the di&s;po&s;al by parliament of any office derived from the authority of the Crown, or now di&s;po&s;able by that authority. It is &s;o far from being any thing new, violent, or alarming, that I do not recollect, in any par|liamentary commi&s;&s;ion, down to the commi&s;&s;ioners of the land tax, that it has ever been otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The objection of the tenure for four years is an objection to all places that are not held during plea&s;ure; but in that objection I pronounce the gentlemen, from my knowledge of their com|plexion and of their principles, to be perfectly in earne&s;t. The party (&s;ay the&s;e gentlemen) of the mini&s;ter who propo&s;es this &s;cheme will be ren|dered powerful by it; for he will name his party friends to the commi&s;&s;ion. This objection again&s;t party is a party objection; and in this too the&s;e gentlemen are perfectly &s;erious. They &s;ee that if, by any intrigue, they &s;hould &s;ucceed to office, they will lo&s;e the <HI>clande&s;tine</HI> patronage, the true in&s;tru|ment of clande&s;tine influence, enjoyed in the name of &s;ub&s;ervient Directors, and of wealthy trembling Indian delinquents. But as often as they are beaten off this ground, they return to it again. The mini&s;ter will name his friends, and per&s;ons of his own party.&mdash;Who &s;hould he name? Should he name his adver|&s;aries? Should he name tho&s;e whom he cannot tru&s;t?
<PB N="97" REF="98">
Should he name tho&s;e to execute his plans, who are the declared enemies to the principles of his reform? His character is here at &s;take. If he propo&s;es for his own ends (but he never will pro|po&s;e) &s;uch names as, from their want of rank, fortune, character, ability, or knowledge, are likely to betray or to fall &s;hort of their tru&s;t, he is in an independent Hou&s;e of Commons; in an Hou&s;e of Commons which has, by its own virtue, de&s;troyed the in&s;truments of parliamentary &s;ub&s;er|vience. This Hou&s;e of Commons would not en|dure the &s;ound of &s;uch names. He would peri&s;h by the means which he is &s;uppo&s;ed to pur&s;ue for the &s;ecurity of his power. The fir&s;t pledge he mu&s;t give of his &s;incerity in this great reform will be in the confidence which ought to be repo&s;ed in tho&s;e names.</P>
<P>For my part, Sir, in this bu&s;ine&s;s I put all indi|rect con&s;iderations wholly out of my mind. My &s;ole que&s;tion, on each clau&s;e of the bill, amounts to this:&mdash;Is the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed required by the ne|ce&s;&s;ities of India? I cannot con&s;ent totally to lo&s;e &s;ight of the real wants of the people who are the objects of it, and to hunt after every matter of party &s;quabble that may be &s;tarted on the &s;everal provi&s;ions. On the que&s;tion of the duration of the commi&s;&s;ion I am clear and decided. Can I, can any one who has taken the &s;malle&s;t trouble to be informed concerning the affairs of India, amu&s;e him&s;elf with &s;o &s;trange an imagination, as that the habitual de&s;poti&s;m and oppre&s;&s;ion, that the mono|polies, the peculations, the univer&s;al de&s;truction of all the legal authority of this kingdom, which have been for twenty years maturing to their pre&s;ent enormity, combined with the di&s;tance of the &s;cene, the boldne&s;s and artifice of delinquents,
<PB N="98" REF="99">
their combination, their exce&s;&s;ive wealth, and the faction they have made in England, can be fully corrected in a &s;horter term than four years? None has hazarded &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion&mdash;None, who has a regard for his reputation, will hazard it.</P>
<P>Sir, the gentlemen, whoever they are, who &s;hall be appointed to this commi&s;&s;ion, have an under|taking of magnitude on their hands, and their &s;ta|bility mu&s;t not only be, but it mu&s;t be thought, real;&mdash;and who is it will believe, that any thing &s;hort of an e&s;tabli&s;hment made, &s;upported, and fixed in its duration, with all the authority of par|liament, can be thought &s;ecure of a rea&s;onable &s;tability? The plan of my Honourable friend is the rever&s;e of that of reforming by the authors of the abu&s;e. The be&s;t we could expect from them is, that they &s;hould not continue their ancient pernicious activity. To tho&s;e we could think of nothing but applying <HI>control</HI>; as we are &s;ure, that even a regard to their reputation (if any &s;uch thing exi&s;ts in them) would oblige them to cover, to conceal, to &s;uppre&s;s, and con&s;equently to prevent, all cure of the grievances of India. For what can be di&s;covered, which is not to their di&s;grace? Every attempt to correct an abu&s;e would be a &s;a|tire on their former admini&s;tration. Every man they &s;hould pretend to call to an account, would be found their in&s;trument or their accomplice. They can never &s;ee a beneficial regulation, but with a view to defeat it. The &s;horter the tenure of &s;uch per&s;ons, the better would be the chance of &s;ome amendment.</P>
<P>But the &s;y&s;tem of the bill is different. It calls in per&s;ons no wi&s;e concerned with any act cen|&s;ured by parliament; per&s;ons generated with, and for the reform of which, they are them&s;elves the
<PB N="99" REF="100">
mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part. To the&s;e the chief regula|tions in the bill are helps, not fetters; they are authorities to &s;upport, not regulations to re&s;train them. From the&s;e we look for much more than innocence. From the&s;e we expect zeal, firmne&s;s, and unremitted activity. Their duty, their cha|racter, binds them to proceedings of vigour; and they ought to have a tenure in their office which precludes all fear, whil&s;t they are acting up to the purpo&s;es of their tru&s;t; a tenure without which, none will undertake plans that require a &s;e|ries and &s;y&s;tem of acts. When they know that they cannot be whi&s;pered out of their duty, that their public conduct cannot be cen&s;ured without a public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; that the &s;chemes which they have begun will not be committed to tho&s;e who will have an intere&s;t and credit in defeat|ing and di&s;gracing them; then we may enter|tain hopes. The tenure is for four years, or during their good behaviour. That good be|haviour is as long as they are true to the princi|ples of the bill; and the judgment is in either Hou&s;e of Parliament. This is the tenure of your judges; and the valuable principle of the bill is, to make a judicial admini&s;tration for India. It is to give confidence in the execution of a duty, which requires as much per&s;everance and forti|tude as can fall to the lot of any that is born of woman.</P>
<P>As to the gain by party, from the Right Ho|nourable gentleman's bill, let it be &s;hewn, that this &s;uppo&s;ed party advantage is pernicious to its object, and the objection is of weight; but until this is done, and this has not been at|tempted, I &s;hall con&s;ider the &s;ole objection, from its tendency to promote the intere&s;t of a party, as altogether contemptible. The kingdom is
<PB N="100" REF="101">
divided into parties, and it ever has been &s;o di|vided, and it ever will be &s;o divided; and if no &s;y&s;tem for relieving the &s;ubjects of this kingdom from oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;natching its affairs from ruin, can be adopted, until it is demon&s;trated that no party can derive an advantage from it, no good can ever be done in this country. If party is to derive an advantage from the reform of India, (which is more than I know, or believe) it ought to be that party which alone, in this king|dom, has its reputation, nay its very being, pledged to the protection and pre&s;ervation of that part of the empire. Great fear is expre&s;|&s;ed, that the commi&s;&s;ioners named in this bill will &s;hew &s;ome regard to a mini&s;ter out of place. To men made like the objectors, this mu&s;t ap|pear criminal. Let it however be remembered by others, that if the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be his friends, they cannot be his &s;laves. But dependants are not in a condition to adhere to friends, nor to principles, nor to any uniform line of conduct. They may begin cen&s;ors, and be obliged to end accomplices. They may be even put under the direction of tho&s;e whom they were appointed to puni&s;h.</P>
<P>The fourth and la&s;t objection is, That the bill will hurt public credit. I do not know whether this requires an an&s;wer. But if it does, look to your foundations. The &s;inking fund is the pillar of credit in this country; and let it not be forgot, that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es, owing to the mi&s;management of the Ea&s;t India Company, have already taken a million from that fund by the non-payment of duties. The bills drawn upon the Company, which are about four millions, cannot be accepted without the con&s;ent of the trea&s;ury. The trea|&s;ury, acting under a parliamentary tru&s;t and
<PB N="101" REF="102">
authority, pledges the public for the&s;e millions. If they pledge the public, the public mu&s;t have a &s;ecurity in its hands for the management of this intere&s;t, or the national credit is gone. For otherwi&s;e it is not only the Ea&s;t India Company, which is a great intere&s;t, that is undone, but, clinging to the &s;ecurity of all your funds, it drags down the re&s;t, and the whole fabric peri&s;hes in one ruin. If this bill does not provide a direction of integrity and of ability competent to that tru&s;t, the objection is fatal. If it does, public credit mu&s;t depend on the &s;upport of the bill.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, if you violate this charter, what &s;ecurity has the charter of the Bank, in which public credit is &s;o deeply concerned, and even the charter of London, in which the rights of &s;o many &s;ub|jects are involved? I an&s;wer, In the like ca&s;e they have no &s;ecurity at all&mdash;No&mdash;no &s;ecurity at all. If the Bank &s;hould, by every &s;pecies of mi&s;ma|nagement, fall into a &s;tate &s;imilar to that of the Ea&s;t India Company; if it &s;hould be oppre&s;&s;ed with demands it could not an&s;wer, engagements which it could not perform, and with bills for which it could not procure payment; no charter &s;hould protect the mi&s;management from correc|tion, and &s;uch public grievances from redre&s;s. If the city of London had the means and will of de&s;troying an empire, and of cruelly oppre&s;&s;ing and tyrannizing over millions of men as good as them&s;elves, the charter of the city of London &s;hould prove no &s;anction to &s;uch tyranny and &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion. Charters are kept, when their purpo&s;es are maintained: they are violated when the pri|vilege is &s;upported again&s;t its end and its object.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I have fini&s;hed all I propo&s;ed to &s;ay, as my rea&s;ons for giving my vote to this Bill. If
<PB N="102" REF="103">
I am wrong, it is not for want of pains to know what is right. This pledge, at lea&s;t, of my rec|titude I have given to my country.</P>
<P>And now, having done my duty to the Bill, let me &s;ay a word to the author. I &s;hould leave him to his own noble &s;entiments, if the un|worthy and illiberal language with which he has been treated, beyond all example of parliamentary liberty, did not make a few words nece&s;&s;ary; not &s;o much in ju&s;tice to him, as to my own feelings. I mu&s;t &s;ay then, that it will be a di&s;tinction ho|nourable to the age, that the re&s;cue of the greate&s;t number of the human race that ever were &s;o grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed, from the greate&s;t tyranny that was ever exerci&s;ed, has fallen to the lot of abilities and di&s;po&s;itions equal to the ta&s;k; that it has fallen to one who has the enlarge|ment to comprehend, the &s;pirit to undertake, and the eloquence to &s;upport, &s;o great a mea&s;ure of hazardous benevolence. His &s;pirit is not owing to his ignorance of the &s;tate of men and things; he well knows what &s;nares are &s;pread about his path, from per&s;onal animo&s;ity, from court intrigues, and po&s;&s;ibly from po|pular delu&s;ion. But he has put to hazard his ea&s;e, his &s;ecurity, his intere&s;t, his power, even his darling popularity, for the benefit of a people whom he has never &s;een. This is the road that all heroes have trod before him. He is traduced and abu&s;ed for his &s;uppo&s;ed motives. He will remember, that obloquy is a nece&s;&s;ary in|gredient in the compo&s;ition of all true glory: he will remember, that it was not only in the Roman cu&s;toms, but it is in the nature and con&s;titution of things, that calumny and abu&s;e are e&s;&s;ential parts of triumph. The&s;e thoughts will &s;upport
<PB N="103" REF="104">
a mind, which only exi&s;ts for honour, under the burthen of temporary reproach. He is doing in|deed a great good; &s;uch as rarely falls to the lot, and almo&s;t as rarely coincides with the de&s;ires, of any man. Let him u&s;e his time. Let him give the whole length of the reins to his benevolence. He is now on a great eminence, where the eyes of mankind are turned to him. He may live long, he may do much. But here is the &s;ummit. He never can exceed what he does this day.</P>
<P>He has faults; but they are faults that, though they may in a &s;mall degree tarni&s;h the lu&s;tre, and &s;ometimes impede the march of his abilities, have nothing in them to extingui&s;h the fire of great virtues. In tho&s;e faults, there is no mixture of deceit, of hypocri&s;y, of pride, of ferocity, of complexional de&s;poti&s;m, or want of feeling for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of mankind. His are faults which might exi&s;t in a de&s;cendant of Henry the Fourth of France, as they did exi&s;t in that father of his country. Henry the Fourth wi&s;hed that he might live to &s;ee a fowl in the pot of every pea&s;ant of his kingdom. That &s;entiment of homely benevo|lence was worth all the &s;plendid &s;ayings that are recorded of kings. But he wi&s;hed perhaps for more than could be obtained, and the goodne&s;s of the man exceeded the power of the King. But this gentleman, a &s;ubject, may this day &s;ay this at lea&s;t, with truth, that he &s;ecures the rice in his pot to every man in India. A poet of antiquity thought it one of the fir&s;t di&s;tinctions to a prince whom he meant to celebrate, that through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of generations, he had been the pro|genitor of an able and virtuous citizen, who by force of the arts of peace, had corrected
<PB N="104" REF="105">
governments of oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed wars of rapine.
<Q><L>Indole proh quanta juvenis, quantumque daturus</L>

This was what was &s;aid of the predece&s;&s;or of the only per&s;on to who&s;e eloquence it does not wrong that of the mover of this bill to be compared. But the Ganges and the Indus are the patrimony of the fame of my Honourable friend, and not of Cicero. I confe&s;s, I anticipate with joy the re|ward of tho&s;e, who&s;e whole con&s;equence, power, and authority, exi&s;t only for the benefit of man|kind; and I carry my mind to all the people, and all the names and de&s;criptions, that, relieved by this bill, will ble&s;s the labours of this Parlia|ment, and the confidence which the be&s;t Hou&s;e of Commons has given to him who the be&s;t de|&s;erves it. The little cavils of party will not be heard, where freedom and happine&s;s will be felt. There is not a tongue, a nation, or religion in India, which will not ble&s;s the pre|&s;iding care and manly beneficence of this Hou&s;e, and of him who propo&s;es to you this great work. Your names will never be &s;eparated before the throne of the Divine Goodne&s;s, in whatever lan|guage, or with whatever rites, pardon is a&s;ked for &s;in, and reward for tho&s;e who imitate the Godhead in his univer&s;al bounty to his creatures. The&s;e honours you de&s;erve, and they will &s;urely be paid, when all the jargon, of influence, and party, and patronage, are &s;wept into oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="106">I have &s;poken what I think, and what I feel, of the mover of this Bill. An Honourable friend of mine, &s;peaking of his merits, was charged with having made a &s;tudied panegyric. I don't know what his was. Mine, I am &s;ure, is a &s;tudied panegyric; the fruit of much meditation; the re&s;ult of the ob&s;ervation of near twenty years. For my own part, I am happy that I have lived to &s;ee this day; I feel my&s;elf overpaid for the labours of eighteen years, when, at this late period, I am able to take my &s;hare, by one hum|ble vote, in de&s;troying a tyranny that exi&s;ts to the di&s;grace of this nation, and the de&s;truction of &s;o large a part of the human &s;pecies.</P>
