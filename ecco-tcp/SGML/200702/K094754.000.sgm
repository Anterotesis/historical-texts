<HEAD>THE CANDIDATE: BY Mr. GRAY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN &s;ly Jemmy Twitcher had &s;mugg'd up his face</L>
<L>With a lick of court white-wa&s;h, and pious grimace,</L>
<L>A wooing he went, where three Si&s;ters of old</L>
<L>In harmle&s;s &s;ociety guttle and &s;cold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lord! Si&s;ter, &s;ays Phy&s;ic to Law, I declare</L>
<L>Such a &s;heep-biting look, &s;uch a pick-pocket air,</L>
<L>Not I, for the Indies! you know I'm no prude;</L>
<L>But his no&s;e is a &s;hame, and his eyes are &s;o lewd!</L>
<L>Then he &s;hambles and &s;traddles &s;o oddly, I fear&mdash;</L>
<L>No; at our time of life, 'twould be &s;illy, my dear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I don't know, &s;ays Law, now methinks, for his look,</L>
<L>'Tis ju&s;t like the picture in Roche&s;ter's book.</L>
<L>But his character, Phyzzy, his morals, his life;</L>
<L>When &s;he died, I can't tell, but he once had a wife.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="9">
<L>They &s;ay he's no Chri&s;tian, loves drinking and whoring,</L>
<L>And all the town rings of his &s;wearing and roaring,</L>
<L>His lying, and filching, and Newgate-bird tricks:&mdash;</L>
<L>Not I,&mdash;for a coronet, chariot and &s;ix.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Divinity heard, between waking and dozing,</L>
<L>Her &s;i&s;ters denying, and Jemmy propo&s;ing;</L>
<L>From dinner &s;he ro&s;e with her bumper in hand,</L>
<L>She &s;troked up her belly, and &s;troked down her band.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What a pother is here about wenching and roaring!</L>
<L>Why David loved catches, and Solomon whoring.</L>
<L>Did not I&s;rael filch from th' Aegyptians of old</L>
<L>Their jewels of &s;ilver, and jewels of gold?</L>
<L>The prophet of Bethel, we read, told a lie:</L>
<L>He drinks; &s;o did Noah: he &s;wears; &s;o do I.</L>
<L>To refu&s;e him for &s;uch peccadillos, were odd;</L>
<L>Be&s;ides, he repents, and he talks about G--.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Never hang down your head, you poor penitent elf!</L>
<L>Come, bu&s;s me, I'll be Mrs. Twitcher my&s;elf.</L>
<L>D--n ye both for a couple of Puritan bitches!</L>
<L>He's Chri&s;tian enough, that repents, and that --------.</L>
