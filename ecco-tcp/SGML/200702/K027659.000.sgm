<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>HEBREWS xiii. 18.</BIBL> &mdash;For we tru&s;t we have a good Con&s;cience,&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_TRUST!&mdash;Tru&s;t we have a good Con&s;cience!&mdash;Surely, you will &s;ay, if there is any Thing in this Life which a Man may depend upon, and to the Knowledge of which he is capable of arriving upon the mo&s;t indi&s;putable Evidence, it mu&s;t be this very Thing,&mdash;Whether he has a good Con&s;cience, or no.</P>
<P>If a Man thinks at all, he cannot well be a Stranger to the true State of this Account;&mdash;He mu&s;t be privy to his own Thoughts and De&s;ires;&mdash;He mu&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="8">
remember his pa&s;t Pur&s;uits, and know certainly the true Springs and Motives, which, in general, have govern'd the Actions of his Life.</P>
<P>In other Matters we may be deceiv'd by fal&s;e Appearances; and, as the Wi&s;e Man complains, <HI>Hardly do we gue&s;s aright at the Things that are upon the Earth, and with Labour do we find the Things that are before us:&mdash;</HI>But here the Mind has all the Evidence and Facts within her&s;elf:&mdash;Is con&s;cious of the Web &s;he has wove:&mdash;Knows its Texture and Finene&s;s, and the exact Share which every Pa&s;&s;ion has had in working upon the &s;everal De&s;igns, which Virtue or Vice has plann'd before her.</P>
<P>Now,&mdash;as Con&s;cience is nothing el&s;e but the Knowledge which the Mind has within it&s;elf of this; and the Judg|ment, either of Approbation or Cen&s;ure, which it unavoidably makes upon the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Actions of our Lives,&mdash;'tis plain, you will &s;ay, from the very
<PB N="3" REF="9">
Terms of the Propo&s;ition, Whenever this inward Te&s;timony goes again&s;t a Man, and he &s;tands &s;elf-accu&s;ed,&mdash;that he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a <HI>guilty Man.</HI> And, on the contrary, When the Report is favourable on his Side, and his Heart condemns him not,&mdash;that it is not a Matter of <HI>Tru&s;t,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle intimates, but a Matter of Certainty and Fact, that the <HI>Con&s;ci|ence</HI> is <HI>good,</HI> and that the <HI>Man</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>good</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t Sight, this may &s;eem to be a true State of the Ca&s;e; and I make no Doubt but the Knowledge of Right and Wrong is &s;o truly impre&s;s'd upon the Mind of Man; that, did no &s;uch Thing ever happen, as that the Con&s;cience of a Man, by long Habits of Sin, might (as the Scripture a&s;&s;ures us, it may) in|&s;en&s;ibly become hard; and, like &s;ome tenderer Parts of his Body, by much Stre&s;s, and continual hard U&s;age, lo&s;e, by Degrees, that nice Sen&s;e and Perception with which God and Nature endowed it.&mdash;Did this never happen:&mdash;Or
<PB N="4" REF="10">
was it certain that Self-Love could ne|ver hang the lea&s;t Bias upon the Judg|ment:&mdash;Or that the Little Intere&s;ts below could ri&s;e up and perplex the Fa|culties of our upper Regions, and en|compa&s;s him about with Clouds and thick Darkne&s;s:&mdash;Could no &s;uch Thing as Favour and Affection enter this &s;acred Court:&mdash;Did WIT di&s;|dain to take a Bribe in it, or was a|&s;hamed to &s;hew its Face as an Advocate for an unwarrantable Enjoyment:&mdash;Or, la&s;tly, were we a&s;&s;ured that INTE|REST &s;tood always unconcern'd whil&s;t the Cau&s;e was hearing,&mdash;and that PAS|SION never got into the Judgment Seat, and pronounced Sentence in the Stead of Rea&s;on, which is &s;uppo&s;ed al|ways to pre&s;ide and determine upon the Ca&s;e:&mdash;Was this truly &s;o, as the Ob|jection mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, no Doubt, then, the Religious and Moral State of a Man would be exactly what He him&s;elf e|&s;teemed it; and the Guilt or Innocence of every Man's Life could be known, in general, by no better Mea&s;ure, than
<PB N="5" REF="11">
the Degrees of his own Approbation or Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>I own, in one Ca&s;e, whenever a Man's Con&s;cience does accu&s;e him (as it &s;eldom errs on that Side) that he is Guilty; and, unle&s;s in melancholy and hypochondriac Ca&s;es, we may &s;afely pronounce upon, that there is always &s;ufficient Grounds for the Accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>But, the Conver&s;e of the Propo&s;ition will not hold true,&mdash;namely, That wherever there is Guilt, the Con&s;cience mu&s;t accu&s;e; and, if it does not, that a Man is therefore Innocent.&mdash;This is not Fact:&mdash;So that the common Con&s;ola|tion which &s;ome good Chri&s;tian or other is hourly admini&s;tring to him&s;elf,&mdash;That he thanks God, his Mind does not mi&s;|give him; and that, con&s;equently, he has a good Con&s;cience, becau&s;e he has a quiet one.&mdash;As current as the Inference is, and as infallible as the Rule appears at fir&s;t Sight, yet, when you look nearer to it, and try the Truth of this Rule
<PB N="6" REF="12">
upon plain Facts, you find it liable to &s;o much Error, from a fal&s;e Application of it:&mdash;The Principle on which it goes &s;o often perverted:&mdash;The whole Force of it lo&s;t, and &s;ometimes &s;o vilely ca&s;t away, that it is painful to produce the common Examples from human Life, which confirm this Account.</P>
<P>A Man &s;hall be vicious and utterly debauched in his Principles; exception|able in his Conduct to the World; &s;hall live &s;hamele&s;s,&mdash;in the open Commi&s;|&s;ion of a Sin which no Rea&s;on or Pre|tence can ju&s;tify;&mdash;a Sin, by which, contrary to all the Workings of Hu|manity within, he &s;hall ruin for ever the deluded Partner of his Guilt;&mdash;rob her of her be&s;t Dowry;&mdash;and not only cover her own Head with Di&s;ho|nour, but involve a whole virtuous Family in Shame and Sorrow for her Sake. Surely,&mdash;you'll think, Con|&s;cience mu&s;t lead &s;uch a Man a trouble|&s;ome Life:&mdash;He can have no Re&s;t Night or Day from its Reproaches.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="13">
Alas! Con&s;cience had &s;omething el&s;e to do all this Time than break in upon him: As <HI>Elijah</HI> reproached the God <HI>Baal,</HI> this <HI>Dome&s;tic God,</HI> was either <HI>talking, or pur&s;uing, or was in a Jour|ney, or, peradventure, he &s;lept and could not be awoke.</HI> Perhaps he was gone out in Company, with HONOUR, to fight a Duel;&mdash;to pay off &s;ome Debt at Play;&mdash;or dirty Annuity the Bargain of his Lu&s;t.&mdash;Perhaps, Con&s;ci|ence all this Time was engaged at home, talking aloud again&s;t petty Larceny, and executing Vengeance upon &s;uch pu|ny Crimes as his Fortune and Rank, in Life, &s;ecured him again&s;t all Temptation of committing:&mdash;So that he lives as merrily,&mdash;&s;leeps as &s;oundly in his Bed;&mdash;and, at the la&s;t, meets Death with as much Unconcernedne&s;s,&mdash;perhaps, much more &s;o than a much better Man.</P>
<P>Another is &s;ordid, unmerciful;&mdash;A &s;trait-hearted, &s;elfi&s;h Wretch, inca|pable either of private Friend&s;hips, or
<PB N="8" REF="14">
public Spirit.&mdash;Take Notice how he pa&s;&s;es by the Widow and Orphan in their Di&s;tre&s;s; and &s;ees all the Mi&s;eries incident to human Life without a Sigh or a Prayer.&mdash;Shall not Con&s;cience ri&s;e up and &s;ting him on &s;uch Occa&s;ions? No.&mdash;Thank God, there is no Occa&s;ion. <Q REND="inline">'I pay every Man his own,&mdash;I have no Fornication to an&s;wer to my Con&s;ci|ence, no faithle&s;s Vows or Promi&s;es to make up, I have debauch'd no Man's Wife or Child.&mdash;Thank God I am not as other Men, Adulterers, Unju&s;t, or even as this Libertine who &s;tands before me.'</Q></P>
<P>A Third is crafty and de&s;igning in his Nature.&mdash;View his whole Life,&mdash;'Tis nothing el&s;e but a cunning Con|texture of dark Arts and unequitable Subterfuges ba&s;ely to defeat the true Intent of all Laws, plain Dealing and the &s;afe Enjoyment of our &s;everal Pro|perties.&mdash;You will &s;ee &s;uch a one, working out a Frame of little De&s;igns upon the Ignorance and Perplexities of the poor and needy Man.&mdash;Shall rai&s;e

a Fortune upon the Inexperience of a Youth,&mdash;or the un&s;u&s;pecting Temper of his Friend, who would have tru&s;ted him with his Life. When old Age comes on, and Repentance calls him to look back upon this black Account, and &s;tate it over again with his Con|&s;cience.&mdash;Con&s;cience looks into the <HI>Statutes at Large,&mdash;</HI>finds perhaps no <HI>expre&s;s Law</HI> broken by what he has done;&mdash;perceives no Penalty or For|feiture incurr'd;&mdash;&s;ees no Scourge wa|ving over his Head,&mdash;or Pri&s;on open|ing its Gate upon him.&mdash;What is there to affright his Con&s;cience?&mdash;Con&s;cience has got &s;afely entrench'd behind the Let|ter of the Law, &s;its there invulnerable, fortified with <HI>Ca&s;es</HI> and <HI>Reports</HI> &s;o &s;trongly on all Sides,&mdash;that 'tis not Preaching can di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s it of its Hold.</P>
<P>Another &s;hall want even this Re|fuge,&mdash;&s;hall break thro' all this Cere|mony of &s;low Chicane; &s;corns the doubt|ful Workings of &s;ecret Plots and cau|tious Trains to bring about his Pur|po&s;e.&mdash;See

the bare-fac'd Villain how he cheats, lyes, perjures, robs, murders,&mdash;Horrid! But indeed much better was not to be expected in this Ca&s;e.&mdash;The poor Man was in the dark!&mdash;His Prie&s;t had got the keeping of his Con&s;cience,&mdash;and all he had let him know of it was, That he mu&s;t believe in the <HI>Pope;</HI>&mdash;Go to Ma&s;s;&mdash;Cro&s;s him&s;elf;&mdash;tell his Beads;&mdash;be a good Catholic; and that this in all Con&s;cience was enough to carry him to Heaven. What?&mdash;If he perjures?&mdash;Why,&mdash;He had a mental Re&s;ervation in it. But if he is &s;o wicked and abandoned a Wretch as you repre&s;ent him,&mdash;If he robs, or murders, will not Con&s;cience on every &s;uch Act, receive a Wound it|&s;elf?&mdash;Ay,&mdash;But the Man has carried it to Confe&s;&s;ion, the Wound dige&s;ts there, and will do well enough,&mdash;and in a &s;hort Time be quite healed up by Ab&s;olution.</P>
<P>O <HI>Popery!</HI> What ha&s;t thou to an|&s;wer for?&mdash;when not content with the

too many natural and fatal Ways thro' which the Heart is every Day thus treacherous to it&s;elf above all Things&mdash;Thou ha&s;t wilfully &s;et open this wide Gate of Deceit before the Face of this unwary <HI>Traveller,</HI>&mdash;too apt, God knows, to go a&s;tray of him&s;elf,&mdash;and confidently &s;peak Peace to his Soul, when there is no Peace.</P>
<P>Of this the common In&s;tances, which I have drawn out of Life, are too noto|rious to require much Evidence. If any Man doubts the Reality of them, or thinks it impo&s;&s;ible for Man to be &s;uch a Bubble to him&s;elf,&mdash;I mu&s;t re|fer him a Moment to his Reflections, and &s;hall then venture to tru&s;t the Appeal with his own Heart. Let him con&s;ider in how different a Degree of Dete&s;tati|on, Numbers of wicked Actions &s;tand <HI>there,</HI> tho' equally bad and vicious in their own Natures&mdash;He will &s;oon find that &s;uch of them as &s;trong Inclination or Cu&s;tom have prompted him to com|mit, are generally dre&s;s'd out and pain|ted

with all the fal&s;e Beauties which a &s;oft and flattering Hand can give them; and that the others, to which he feels no Propen&s;ity, appear, at once, naked and deformed, &s;urrounded with all the true Circum&s;tances of Folly and Di&s;ho|nour.</P>
<P>When <HI>David</HI> &s;urprized <HI>Saul</HI> &s;leeping in the Cave, and cut off the Skirt of his Robe,&mdash;we read, his Heart &s;mote him for what he had done.&mdash;But, in the Matter of <HI>Uriah,</HI> where a faithful and gallant Servant, whom he ought to have lov'd and honour'd, fell to make Way for his Lu&s;t; where <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> had &s;o much greater Rea&s;on to take the A|larm,&mdash;his Heart &s;mote him not.&mdash;A whole Year had almo&s;t pa&s;&s;ed from the fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion of that Crime&mdash;to the Time <HI>Nathan</HI> was &s;ent to reprove him; and we read not once of the lea&s;t Sor|row or Compunction of Heart, which he te&s;tified during all that Time, for what he had done.</P>

Thus Con&s;cience, this once able Mo|nitor,&mdash;placed on high as a Judge with|in us&mdash;and intended, by our Maker, as a ju&s;t and equitable one too,&mdash;by an un|happy Train of Cau&s;es and Impediments,&mdash;takes often &s;uch imperfect Cognizance of what pa&s;&s;es,&mdash;does its Office &s;o negli|gently,&mdash;&s;ometimes &s;o corruptly, that it is not to be tru&s;ted alone: And there|fore, we find, there is a Nece&s;&s;ity, an ab|&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, of joining another Prin|ciple with it, to aid, if not govern, its Determinations.</P>
<P>So that if you would form a ju&s;t Judgment of what is of infinite Impor|tance to you not to be mi&s;led in; name|ly, in what Degree of real Merit you &s;tand, either as an hone&s;t Man,&mdash;an u&s;e|ful Citizen,&mdash;a faithful Subject to your King,&mdash;or a good Servant to your God,&mdash;call in RELIGION and MORALITY.&mdash;Look&mdash;What is written in the Law of God?&mdash;How reade&s;t thou?&mdash;Con&s;ult calm Rea&s;on, and the unchangeable O|bligations

To have the Fear of God before our Eyes; and, in our mutual Dealings with each other, to govern our Actions by the eternal Mea&s;ures of Right and Wrong:&mdash;The fir&s;t of the&s;e will comprehend the Duties of Religion: The &s;econd tho&s;e of Morality; which are &s;o in&s;e|parably connected together, that you cannot divide the&s;e two <HI>Tables,</HI> even in Imagination (tho' the Attempt is of|ten made in Practice) without breaking and mutually de&s;troying them both.</P>
<P>I &s;aid the Attempt is often made;&mdash;and &s;o it is;&mdash;there being nothing more common than to &s;ee a Man, who has no Sen&s;e at all of Religion,&mdash;and indeed has <HI>&s;o much</HI> of Hone&s;ty, as to pretend to none; who would yet take it as the bittere&s;t Affront, &s;hould you but hint at a Su&s;picion of his Moral Character,&mdash;or imagine he was not con&s;cientiou&s;ly ju&s;t, and &s;crupulous to the uttermo&s;t Mite.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="23">
When there is &s;ome Appearance that it is &s;o,&mdash;tho' one is not willing even to &s;u&s;pect the Appearance of &s;o great a Virtue, as moral Hone&s;ty;&mdash;yet, were we to look into the Grounds of it in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, I am per&s;uaded we &s;hould find little Rea&s;on to envy &s;uch a Man the Honour of his Motive.</P>
<P>Let him declaim as pompou&s;ly as he can on the Subject, it will be found at la&s;t to re&s;t upon no better Foundation than either his Intere&s;t, his Pride, his Ea&s;e; or &s;ome &s;uch little and changeable Pa&s;&s;ion, as will give us but &s;mall De|pendence upon his Actions in Matters of great Stre&s;s.</P>
<P>Give me Leave to illu&s;trate this by an Example.</P>
<P>I know the Banker I deal with, or the Phy&s;ician I u&s;ually call in, to be neither of them Men of much Religion: I hear them make a Je&s;t of it every

Day, and treat all its Sanctions with &s;o much Scorn and Contempt, as to put the Matter pa&s;t Doubt. Well,&mdash;notwith|&s;tanding this, I put my Fortune into the Hands of the one,&mdash;and, what is dear|er &s;till to me, I tru&s;t my Life to the hone&s;t Skill of the other.&mdash;Now let me examine what is my Rea&s;on for this great Confidence.&mdash;Why,&mdash;in the fir&s;t Place, I believe there is no Proba|bility that either of them will employ the Power, I put into their Hands, to my Di&s;advantage. I con&s;ider that Hone&s;ty &s;erves the Purpo&s;es of this Life.&mdash;I know their Succe&s;s in the World de|pends upon the Fairne&s;s of their Cha|racters;&mdash;that they cannot hurt me without hurting them&s;elves more.</P>
<P>But put it otherwi&s;e, namely, that Intere&s;t lay for once on the other Side.&mdash;That a Ca&s;e &s;hould happen wherein the one, without Stain to his Reputa|tion, could &s;ecrete my Fortune, and leave me naked in the World;&mdash;Or
<PB N="19" REF="25">
that the Other could &s;end me out of it, and enjoy an E&s;tate by my Death, with|out Di&s;honour to him&s;elf or his Art.&mdash;In this Ca&s;e what Hold have I of either of them?&mdash;Religion, the &s;tronge&s;t of all Motives, is out of the Que&s;tion.&mdash;Inte|re&s;t, the next mo&s;t powerful Motive in this World, is &s;trongly again&s;t me.&mdash;I have nothing left to ca&s;t into the Scale to ballance this Temptation.&mdash;I mu&s;t lay at the Mercy of Honour,&mdash;or &s;ome &s;uch capricious Principle.&mdash;Strait Se|curity! for two of my be&s;t and mo&s;t valuable Ble&s;&s;ings,&mdash;my Property and my Life!</P>
<P>As therefore we can have no Depen|dence upon Morality without Religion;&mdash;&s;o, on the other Hand, there is no|thing better to be expected from Reli|gion without Morality; nor can any Man be &s;uppos'd to di&s;charge his Du|ties to God, (whatever fair Appearances he may hang out, that he does &s;o) if he does not pay as con&s;cientious a Re|gard
<PB N="20" REF="26">
to the Duties, which he owes his Fellow-Creature.</P>
<P>This is a Point capable in it&s;elf of &s;trict Demon&s;tration.&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, 'tis no Rarity to &s;ee a Man who&s;e real moral Merit &s;tands very low, who yet entertains the highe&s;t Notion of him&s;elf, in the Light of a devout and religious Man. He &s;hall not only be covetous, revengeful, implacable,&mdash;but even wan|ting in Points of common Hone&s;ty.&mdash;Yet becau&s;e he talks loud again&s;t the Infidelity of the Age,&mdash;is zealous for &s;ome Points of Religion,&mdash;goes twice a Day to Church,&mdash;attends the Sacra|ments,&mdash;and amu&s;es him&s;elf with a few In&s;trumental Duties of Religion,&mdash;&s;hall cheat his Con&s;cience into a Judgment that for this he is a religious Man, and has di&s;charged faithfully his Duty to God: And you will find, that &s;uch a Man, thro' Force of this Delu&s;ion, gene|rally looks down with Spiritual Pride upon every other Man who has le&s;s

Affectation of Piety, tho', perhaps, ten Times more moral Hone&s;ty than him|&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>This is likewi&s;e a &s;ore Evil under the Sun;</HI> and I believe there is no one mi&s;taken Principle which, for its Time, has wrought more &s;erious Mi&s;chiefs. For a general Proof of this,&mdash;examine the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church.&mdash;See what Scenes of Cruelty, Murders, Rapines, Blood&s;hed, have all been &s;anctified by a Religion not &s;trictly go|verned by Morality.</P>
<P>In how many Kingdoms of the World, has the cru&s;ading Sword of this mi&s;guided Saint-Errant &s;pared neither Age, or Merit, or Sex, or Condition.&mdash;And, as he fought under the Banners of a Religion, which &s;et him loo&s;e from Ju&s;tice and Humanity,&mdash;he &s;hew|ed none,&mdash;mercile&s;sly trampled upon both, heard neither the Cries of the Unfortunate, nor pitied their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="28">
If the Te&s;timony of pa&s;t Centuries in this Matter is not &s;ufficient,&mdash;con&s;i|der at this In&s;tant, how the Votaries of that Religion are every Day think|ing to do Service and Honour to God, by Actions which are a Di&s;honour and Scandal to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>To be convinced of this, go with me for a Moment into the Pri&s;ons of the In|qui&s;ition.&mdash;Behold <HI>Religion</HI> with Mer|cy and Ju&s;tice chain'd down under her Feet,&mdash;there &s;itting gha&s;tly upon a black Tribunal, propp'd up with Racks and In&s;truments of Torment.&mdash;Hark!&mdash;What a piteous Groan!&mdash;See the me|lancholy Wretch who utter'd it, ju&s;t brought forth to undergo the Angui&s;h of a Mock-Trial, and endure the ut|mo&s;t Pains that a &s;tudied Sy&s;tem of <HI>religious Cruelty</HI> has been able to invent. Behold this helple&s;s Victim delivered up to his Tormentors. His Body &s;o wa&s;ted with Sorrow and long Confine|ment, you'll &s;ee every Nerve and
<PB N="23" REF="29">
Mu&s;cle as it &s;uffers.&mdash;Ob&s;erve the la&s;t Movement of that horrid Engine.&mdash;What Convul&s;ions it has thrown him into.&mdash;Con&s;ider the Nature of the Po&s;ture in which he now lies &s;tretch'd.&mdash;What exqui&s;ite Torture he endures by it.&mdash;'Tis all Nature can bear.&mdash;Good God! See how it keeps his weary Soul hanging upon his trembling Lips, willing to take its Leave,&mdash;but cruelly not &s;uffer'd to depart. Behold the unhappy Wretch led back to his Cell,&mdash;dragg'd out of it again to meet the Flames,&mdash;and the In&s;ults in his la&s;t Agonies, which this Principle&mdash;This Principle that there <HI>can</HI> be Religion without Morality, has prepared for him.</P>
<P>The &s;ure&s;t Way to try the Merit of any di&s;puted Notion,&mdash;is to trace down the Con&s;equences &s;uch a Notion has produced, and compare them with the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Chri&s;tianity.&mdash;'Tis the &s;hort and deci&s;ive Rule, which our Saviour
<PB N="24" REF="30">
has left for the&s;e and &s;uch like Ca&s;es,&mdash;and is worth a thou&s;and Arguments.<HI>&mdash;By their Fruits,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>ye &s;hall know them.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Religion and Morality, like fa&s;t Friends and natural Allies, can never be &s;et at Variance, without the mutual Ruin and Di&s;honour of them both;&mdash;and whoever goes about this unfriendly Of|fice, is no Well-wi&s;her to either;&mdash;and whatever he pretends, he deceives his own Heart, and, I fear, his Morality as well as his Religion will be vain.</P>
<P>I will add no farther to the Length of this Di&s;cour&s;e, than by two or three &s;hort and independent Rules, deducible from what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t.</HI> Whenever a Man talks loudly again&s;t Religion, always &s;u&s;pect that it is not his Rea&s;on but his Pa&s;&s;ions which have got the Better of his Creed.
<PB N="25" REF="31">
&mdash;A <HI>bad Life</HI> and a <HI>good Belief</HI> are di&s;|agreeable and trouble&s;ome Neighbours, and where they &s;eparate, depend upon it, 'tis for no other Cau&s;e but Quietne&s;s Sake.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly.</HI> When a Man thus repre&s;ented, tells you in any particular In&s;tance, that &s;uch a Thing goes <HI>again&s;t</HI> his Con|&s;cience,&mdash;always believe he means ex|actly the &s;ame Thing as when he tells you &s;uch a Thing goes again&s;t his Sto|mach,&mdash;a pre&s;ent Want of Appetite being generally the true &s;e of both.</P>
<P>In a Word,&mdash;tru&s;t the Man in no|thing&mdash;who has not a Con&s;cience in every Thing.</P>
<P>And in your own Ca&s;e remember this plain Di&s;tinction, a Mi&s;take, in which, has ruin'd Thou&s;ands.&mdash;That your Con&s;cience is not a Law;&mdash;no,&mdash;God and Rea&s;on made the Law, and has placed Con&s;cience within you to deter|mine,&mdash;not like an <HI>A&s;iatic Cadi,</HI> ac|cording
<PB N="26" REF="32">
to the Ebbs and Flows of his own Pa&s;&s;ions:&mdash;But like a <HI>Briti&s;h Judge</HI> in this Land of Liberty, who makes no new Law,&mdash;but faithfully declares that glorious Law which he finds already written.</P>
