<P>I Am &s;afe arrived at my bower&mdash;and I tru&s;t that you have no longer any doubt about coming to embower it with me. Having, for &s;ix months together, been running at the ring of plea&s;ure, you will find that repo&s;e here which, all young
<PB N="2" REF="4">
as you are, you ought to want. We will be witty, or cla&s;&s;ical, or &s;entimental, as it &s;hall plea&s;e you be&s;t. My milk-maids &s;hall weave you garlands; and every day after coffee I will take you to pay a vi&s;it to my nuns. Do not, however, indulge your fancy beyond mea&s;ure, but rather let me indulge mine, or, at lea&s;t, let me give you the hi&s;tory of it, and the fair &s;i&s;terhood who dwell in one of it's vi&s;ionary corners. Now, what is all this about? you'll &s;ay&mdash;have a few moments patience, and I will tell you.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know then, that, on pa&s;&s;ing out of my back door, I very &s;oon gain a path, which, after conducting me through &s;everal verdant meadows and &s;hady thick|ets, brings me, in about twenty minutes, to the ruins of a mona&s;tery, where, in
<PB N="3" REF="5">
times long pa&s;t, a certain number of cloi&s;|tered females had devoted their&mdash;lives&mdash;I &s;carce know what I was going to write&mdash;to religious &s;olitude.&mdash;This &s;aunter of mine, when I take it, I call <HI>paying a vi&s;it to my nuns.</HI></P>
<P>It is an awful &s;pot&mdash;a rivulet flows by it, and a lofty bank, covered with wood, that ri&s;es abruptly on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, gives a gloom to the whole, and for|bids the thoughts, if they were ever &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, from wandering away from the place. Solitary &s;anctity never found a nook more appropriated to her nature!&mdash;It is a place for an antiquary to &s;ojourn in for a month&mdash;and examine with all the &s;pirit of ru&s;ty re&s;earch. But I am no antiquary, as you well know&mdash;and, therefore, I come
<PB N="4" REF="6">
here upon a different and a better errand&mdash;that is&mdash;to examine my&s;elf.</P>
<P>So I lean, lackaday&s;ically, over a gate, and look at the pa&s;&s;ing &s;tream&mdash;and for|give the &s;pleen, the gout, and the envy of a malicious world. And, after having ta|ken a &s;troll beneath mouldering arches, I &s;ummon the &s;i&s;terhood together, and take the faire&s;t among them, and &s;it down with her on a &s;tone beneath a bunch of al|ders&mdash;and do&mdash;what? you'll &s;ay&mdash;why I ex|amine her gentle heart, and &s;ee how it is attuned; I then gue&s;s at her wi&s;hes, and play with the cro&s;s that hangs at her bo|&s;om&mdash;in &s;hort&mdash;I make love to her.</P>
<P>Fie, for &s;hame! Tri&s;tram&mdash;that is not as it ought to be:&mdash;Now I declare, on the contrary, that it is exactly what it
<PB N="5" REF="7">
ought to be; for, though philo&s;ophers may &s;ay, among the many other fooli&s;h things philo&s;ophers have &s;aid, that a man who is in love is not in his right &s;en&s;es&mdash;I do a&s;|&s;ert, in oppo&s;ition to all their &s;aws and &s;ee-&s;aws, that he is never in his right &s;en|&s;es, or I would rather &s;ay his right &s;enti|ments, but when he is pur&s;uing &s;ome <HI>Dulcinea</HI> or other. If that &s;hould be the ca&s;e with you at this moment, I will for|give your &s;taying from me; but if this let|ter &s;hould find you at the in&s;tant when your la&s;t flame is blown out, and before a new one is lighted up, and you &s;hould not take po&s;t and come to me and my nuns, I will abu&s;e you in their name and my own, to the end of the chapter&mdash;though I believe, after all, at the end of the chapter, I &s;hould feel my&s;elf</P>

<P>AND &s;o you have been at the &s;eats of the learned.&mdash;If I could have gue&s;&s;ed at &s;uch an intention, I would have contrived that &s;omething in an epi&s;tolary &s;hape &s;hould have met you there, with half a dozen lines recommending you to the care of the <HI>Ma&s;ter of Je&s;us.</HI>&mdash;He was my tutor when I was at College, and a very good kind of man. He u&s;ed to let me have my way, when I was under his direction, and that &s;hewed his &s;en&s;e, for I was born to
<PB N="7" REF="9">
travel out of the common road, and to get a&s;ide from the highway path, and he had &s;en&s;e enough to &s;ee it, and not to trouble me with trammels. I was neither made to be a <HI>thill-hor&s;e,</HI> nor a <HI>fore-hor&s;e;</HI> in &s;hort I was not made to go in a <HI>team,</HI> but to am|ble along as I liked; and &s;o that I do not kick, or &s;pla&s;h, or run over any one, who in the name of common &s;en&s;e has a right to interrupt me?&mdash;Let the good folks laugh if they will, and much good may it do them. Indeed, I am per&s;uaded, and I think I could prove, nay, and I would do it, if I were writing a book in&s;tead of a letter, the truth of what I once told a very great &s;tate&s;man, orator, politician, and as much more as you plea&s;e<HI>&mdash;that every time a man &s;miles&mdash;much more &s;o&mdash;when he laughs&mdash;it adds &s;omething to the fragment of life.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
But the &s;taying five days at Cambridge does not come within the immediate reach of my crazy comprehen&s;ion, and you might have employed your time much, much better, in urging your mettle&s;ome tits to wards Coxwould.</P>
<P>I may &s;uppo&s;e that you have been pick|ing a hole in the &s;kirts of Gibb's cum|brous architecture, or mea&s;uring the fa&ccedil;ade of Trinity College Library, or peering about the gothic perfections of King's College Chapel, or, which was doing a better thing, &s;ipping tea and talking &s;entiment|ally with the Mi&s;s Cookes, or di&s;turbing Mr. Gray with one of your enthu&s;ia&s;tic vi&s;its&mdash;I &s;ay <HI>di&s;turbing</HI> him, for with all your own agreeablene&s;s, and all your ad|miration of him, he would rather have your room than your company. But mark
<PB N="9" REF="11">
me, I do not &s;ay this to his glory, but to his &s;hame. For I would be content with any room, &s;o I had your company.</P>
<P>But tell me, I be&s;eech you, what you did with <HI>S&mdash;</HI> all this time. The look|ing at the heavy walls of muzzing Colle|ges, and gazing at the mouldy pictures of their founders, is not altogether in his way; nor did he wander where I have whilom wandered, on Cam's all verdant banks with willows crowned, and call the mu&s;e: Alas, he'd rather call a waiter&mdash;and how &s;uch a milk&s;op as you could tra|vel&mdash;I mean be &s;uffered to travel, two leagues in the &s;ame chai&s;e with him, I know not&mdash;but from that admirable and kind pliability of &s;pirit which you po&s;&s;e&s;s when|ever you plea&s;e, but which you do not al|ways plea&s;e to po&s;&s;e&s;s. I do not mean
<PB N="10" REF="12">
that a man &s;hould wear a court dre&s;s when he is going to a puppet-&s;how; but, on the other hand, to keep the be&s;t &s;uit of em|broidery for tho&s;e only whom he loves, though there is &s;omething noble in it, will never do. The world, my dear friend, will not let it do. For while there are &s;uch qualities in the human mind as ingratitude and duplicity, unlimited confidence and this patrioti&s;m of friend&s;hip, which I have heard you rave and rant about, is a very dangerous bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I could preach a &s;ermon on the &s;ubject&mdash;to &s;ay the truth, I am got as grave as if I were in my pulpit. Thus are the pro|jects of this life de&s;troyed. When I took up my pen, my humour was gay, fri&s;ky, and fanciful&mdash;and now I am &s;liding into all the &s;ee-&s;aw gravity of &s;olemn councils.
<PB N="11" REF="13">
I want nothing but an a&s;s to look over my pales and &s;et up a braying to keep me in countenance.</P>
<P>Leave, leave your Lincoln&s;hire &s;eats, and come to my dale; S&mdash;, I know, is heartily tired of you. Be&s;ides I want a nur&s;e, for I am not quite well, and have taken to milk-coffee. Remember me, however, to him kindly, and to your&s;elf cordially, for</P>

<P>AND &s;o you &s;it in S&mdash;'s temple and drink tea, and conver&s;e cla&s;&s;ically:&mdash;now I &s;hould like to know what is the na|ture of this di&s;order which you call cla&s;&s;i|cality;&mdash;if it con&s;i&s;ts in a rage to conver&s;e on ancient &s;ubjects in a modern manner; or on modern &s;ubjects in an antient one;&mdash;or are you both out of your &s;en&s;es, and do you fancy your&s;elves with Virgil and Horace at Sinue&s;&s;a, or with Tully and At|ticus at Tu&s;culum? Oh how it would de|light
<PB N="13" REF="15">
me to peep at you from behind a lau|rel bu&s;h, and &s;ee you &s;urrounded with co|lumns and covered by a dome, quaffing the extract of a Chine&s;e weed, and talking of men who boa&s;ted the in&s;piration of the Falernian grape!</P>
<P>What a couple of vapid, inert beings you mu&s;t be!&mdash;I &s;hould really give you up for lo&s;t, if it were not for the confi|dence I have in the reinvigorating powers of my &s;ociety, to which you mu&s;t now have immediate recour&s;e, if you wi&s;h for a re&s;toration. Make ha&s;te then, my good friend, and &s;eek the aid of your phy&s;ician ere it be too late.</P>
<P>You know not the intere&s;t I take in your welfare. Have I not ordered all the li|nen to be taken out of the pre&s;s, and re|wa&s;hed
<PB N="14" REF="16">
before it was dirty, that you may have a clean table cloth every day, with a napkin into the bargain? And have I not ordered a kind of windmill, that makes my head ach again with its clatter, to be placed in my fine cherry-tree, that the fruit may be pre&s;erved from the birds, to furni&s;h you a de&s;ert? And do you not know that you will have curds and cream for your &s;upper? Think on the&s;e things, and let S&mdash;  go to Lincoln &s;e&s;&s;ions by him&s;elf, and talk cla&s;&s;ically with country ju&s;tices. In the mean time we will philo|&s;ophize and &s;entimentalize;&mdash;the la&s;t word is a bright invention of the moment in which it was written, for yours or Dr. John&s;on's &s;ervice,&mdash;and you &s;hall &s;it in my &s;tudy and take a peep into the world as into a &s;how-box, and amu&s;e your&s;elf as I pre&s;ent the pictures of it to your imagi|nation.
<PB N="15" REF="17">
Thus will I teach you to laugh at its follies, to pity its errors, and de&s;pi&s;e its inju&s;tice;&mdash;and I will introduce you, among the re&s;t, to &s;ome tender-hearted dam&s;el, on who&s;e cheeks &s;ome bitter af|fliction has placed a tear;&mdash;and having heard her &s;tory, you &s;hall take a white handkerchief from your pocket to wipe the moi&s;ture from her eyes, and from your own:&mdash;and then you &s;hall go to bed, not to the dam&s;el, but with an heart con&s;cious of tho&s;e &s;entiments, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e feelings, which will give &s;oftne&s;s to your pillow, &s;weetne&s;s to your &s;lumbers, and gladne&s;s to your waking moments.</P>
<P>You &s;hall &s;it in my porch, and laugh at attic ve&s;tibules. I love the cla&s;&s;ics as well as any man ought to love them,&mdash;but a|mong all their fine &s;ayings, their fine wri|tings,

and their fine ver&s;es, their mo&s;t en|thu&s;ia&s;tic admirer would not be able to find me half a dozen &s;tories that have any &s;enti|ment in them,&mdash;and &s;o much for that.</P>

<P>I AM grieved for your downfall, though it was only out of a park-chair&mdash;May it be the la&s;t you will receive in this world; though, while I write this wi&s;h, my heart heaves a deep &s;igh, and I believe it will not be read by you, my friend, without a &s;imilar accompaniment.</P>
<P>Alas! alas! my dear boy, you are born with talents to &s;oar aloft with; but you have an heart, which, my apprehen&s;ions
<PB N="18" REF="20">
tell me, will keep you low.&mdash;I do not mean, you know I do not, any thing ba&s;e or grovelling;&mdash;but, in&s;tead of winging your way above the &s;torm, I am afraid that you will calmly &s;ubmit to its rigours, and hou&s;e your&s;elf afterwards in &s;ome hum|ble &s;hed, and there live contented, and chaunt away the time, and be lo&s;t to the world.</P>
<P>How the wind blows I know not; and I have not an inclination to walk to my window, where, perhaps, I might catch the cour&s;e of a cloud and be &s;atisfied,&mdash;but here I am up to my knees&mdash;I &s;hould rather &s;ay up to my heart, in a &s;ubject, which is ever accompanied with &s;ome af|flicting vaticination or other. I am not afraid of your doing any wrong but to your&s;elf. A &s;ecret knowledge of &s;ome
<PB N="19" REF="21">
circum&s;tances which you have never com|municated to me, have alarmed my affec|tion for you&mdash;not from any immediate harm they can produce, but from the con|viction they have forced upon me, con|cerning your di&s;po&s;ition, and the nicer parts of your character. If you do not come &s;oon to me, I &s;hall take the wings of &s;ome fine morning and fly to you; but I &s;hould rather have you here; for I wi&s;h to have you alone; and if you will let me be a <HI>Mentor</HI> to you for one little month, I will be content&mdash;and you &s;hall be a <HI>Men|tor</HI> to me the re&s;t of the year; or, if you will, the re&s;t of my days.</P>
<P>I long, mo&s;t anxiou&s;ly, my dear friend, to teach you&mdash;not to give an opiate to tho&s;e &s;en&s;ibilities of your nature, which make me love you as I do; nor to check
<PB N="20" REF="22">
your glowing fancy, that gives &s;uch grace to poli&s;h'd youth; nor to yield the beve|rage of the fountain for the nectar of the ca&s;k; but to u&s;e the world no better, or to plea&s;e you a very little better, than it de|&s;erves.&mdash;But think not, I be&s;eech you, that I would introduce my young <HI>Telemachus</HI> to &s;uch a foul and &s;quint-eyed piece of pol|lution as Su&s;picion. Avaunt to &s;uch a ba&s;e ungenerous pa&s;&s;ion! I would &s;ooner car|ry you to <HI>Calyp&s;o</HI> at once, and give you at lea&s;t a little plea&s;ure for your pains. But there is a certain little &s;pot to be found &s;omewhere in the mid-way between tru&s;t|ing every body and tru&s;ting nobody; and &s;o well am I acquainted with the longi|tudes, latitudes, and bearings of this world of ours, that I could put my finger upon it, and direct you at once to it; and I think I could give you &s;o many good
<PB N="21" REF="23">
rea&s;ons why you &s;hould go there, that you would not he&s;itate to &s;et off immediately, and I would accompany you thither, and &s;erve as a <HI>Cicerone</HI> to you. I wi&s;h therefore much, very much, to talk with you about that and other &s;erious matters.</P>
<P>As for your bodily infirmity, never mind it; you may come here by gentle &s;tages, and without inconvenience; and I will be your &s;urgeon, or your nur&s;e; and warm your verjuice every evening, and bathe your &s;prain with it, and talk of the&s;e things. So tell me, I pray you, the day that I am to meet you at York. In the mean time, and always may a good Provi|dence protect you&mdash;It is the &s;incere wi&s;h of</P>

<P>THIS letter will meet you at Hew|it's, in&s;tead of my&s;elf; for I have taken &s;ome how or other, and I know not how, a very violent cold, and cannot come; and as I would receive you with my be&s;t looks, if po&s;&s;ible, as well as my be&s;t welcome, I am nur&s;ing my&s;elf into &s;ome &s;ort of re&s;|toration again&s;t your arrival; though my cough torments me without mercy, and I am &s;o hoar&s;e at this moment, that I can &s;carce make my&s;elf heard acro&s;s my table.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25">
This phthi&s;ic of mine will &s;ooner or la|ter, and, perhaps, &s;ooner than either I or you, my friend, may think, bear me to my la&s;t a&s;ylum from a &s;plenetic world. You will &s;ay, perhaps, that I am &s;plenetic al&s;o in my turn by writing thus <HI>gravely;</HI>&mdash;but as I well know this vile cough is the engine which that &s;care-crow death em|ploys to &s;hatter my poor frame, and bring it to his dominion, how can I be merry or &s;atisfied?&mdash;It is true, I love laughing and merry-making, and all that, as well as any &s;oul upon earth; neverthele&s;s, I cannot think of piping and taboring it out of the world, like the figures in <HI>Holbein's dance.</HI> Be&s;ides I have been &s;o u&s;ed to my own way, that I don't like to be put out of it, by being made to cough &s;o villainou&s;ly as I do, more than half my time. It is mo&s;t inurbane in him,&mdash;by Heaven, it is cow|ardly
<PB N="24" REF="26">
in the ra&s;cal, to rob me of tho&s;e &s;pi|rits, with which I have &s;o often defeated him.</P>
<P>And this is not all,&mdash;for I have forty volumes more to write; nay, and have ab&s;olutely promi&s;ed the world to do it; and I have my engagements to you as well as to the world&mdash;and to my&s;elf as well as to you both; and how &s;hall I keep my word as an author and a gentleman, and what is of more con&s;equence than either&mdash;as a friend,&mdash;if I cannot &s;hake off this piece of anatomy: Be&s;ides, no one can do the&s;e things for me but my&s;elf; the bu&s;ine&s;s is beyond all power of attorney; for if I were to leave fifty executors to my la&s;t will and te&s;tament, and if they were to be joined by a regiment of admini&s;trators and a&s;|&s;igns,
<PB N="25" REF="27">
they could not take up their pens and do as I would do.</P>
<P>But what a wayward fancy mine is!&mdash;and with what a &s;educing pen am I writing&mdash;for I am got leagues without number from the idea which danced before me, when I fir&s;t began this letter. And here I am wrong again:&mdash;for what great di&s;tance can there be between the grave of my grand|father and my own; and it was to his tomb that I wi&s;hed to conduct you!</P>
<P>I know full well, that all &s;prained your ancle may be, it will be wholly im|po&s;&s;ible for you to pa&s;s through York, without popping your head into its cathe|dral, and indulging your mind with a few of tho&s;e reflections which &s;uch a building is calculated to in&s;pire. Now, when you
<PB N="26" REF="28">
are there, tell a verger to conduct you to the tomb of Archbi&s;hop Sterne. He is the &s;ame who&s;e picture you &s;aw at Cam|bridge, and which you were plea&s;ed to &s;ay, bore &s;o &s;trong a re&s;emblance to me. In the marble whole length figure which dig|nifies the monument, you will find the likene&s;s &s;till &s;tronger: and if I drop in this corner of the world, I &s;hould like to be depo&s;ited in that corner of the church, and &s;leep out my la&s;t &s;leep be&s;ide my pious ance&s;tor.</P>
<P>He was an excellent prelate and an ho|ne&s;t man:&mdash;I have not half his virtues, if report &s;peaks true of us both, which, for his &s;ake, I hope it does&mdash;and for my own, I hope it does not. Though, to u&s;e an expre&s;&s;ion which dropped from the lips and at the table of a brother <HI>Arch-</HI>prelate

<P>I SHALL forgive the tardine&s;s of your pa&s;&s;age hither, if it be true, as a &s;till &s;mall voice of a York go&s;&s;ip has informed me, that you repo&s;e, with your infirm limb, on a &s;ofa, in Mrs. &mdash;'s withdrawing room, and have your coffee and tea handed you by her two daughters, and one of them has charms enough for the three Graces&mdash;and that they play on their harp&s;ichord, and, with voices &s;tolen from heaven, &s;ing duets to you, while you, &s;tretched on da|ma&s;k,
<PB N="29" REF="31">
command, as it were, that little world of beauty and good &s;en&s;e which &s;ur|rounds you.</P>
<P>You cannot, my good friend, have known the charming people, with whom you are &s;o happy, more than eight and forty hours at mo&s;t.

Indeed, I may claim the credit of having taught you the maxim, that life is too &s;hort to be long in forming the tender and happy connections of it.

I love Garrick on the &s;tage, better than any thing in the world, <HI>except Mrs. Garrick off it;</HI> and if there is any one heart in the world I &s;hould like to get a corner of&mdash;it would be hers. But I am too great a &s;in|ner to do more than approach the portal of &s;o much excellence&mdash;there to bend one knee at lea&s;t, and ejaculate at a di&s;tance from the altar.</P>
<P>I have often thought on what this &s;pirit of idolatry, which is continually bearing me to the feet of &s;ome fair image or other, will do with me twenty years hence; and whether, after having had, during my younger days, a dam&s;el to &s;mooth my pil|low&mdash;I &s;hould find one, in my age, to put on my &s;lipper.

the interruptions and dangers that will be nece&s;&s;arily encountered in the cour&s;e of it: But this is the duty of friend&s;hip, and ari&s;es from the nature of our exi&s;tence and the &s;tate of the world.

<P>But you will tell me, perhaps, that it is not the matter of the lo&s;s, but the manner of it, that you con&s;ider as a misfortune: The being treated &s;o ill, and with &s;o much ingratitude, is the bu&s;ine&s;s that afflicts you. <HI>Hall,</HI> who is &s;till laughing, bids me tell you for your comfort, that he who <HI>dupes</HI> mu&s;t be a <HI>ra&s;cal;</HI> and he who is duped

<HEAD>LETTER IX. To &mdash; &mdash;.</HEAD>
<P>I DID not an&s;wer your letter as you de&s;ired me, for at the moment I receiv|ed it, I really thought all my projects, for &s;ome time to come, were <HI>burned</HI> to a <HI>cinder;</HI> or, which is the better expre&s;&s;ion of the two, had evaporated in &s;moke;&mdash;for, not half an hour before an affrighted me&s;&s;enger, on a breathle&s;s hor&s;e, had arrived to ac|quaint me, that the par&s;onage hou&s;e at&mdash;was on fire, when he came away, and burning like a bundle of faggots; and
<PB N="46" REF="48">
while I was preparing to &s;et off to &s;ee my hou&s;e, after it was burned down, your let|ter arrived to con&s;ole me on my way; for it gave me every a&s;&s;urance that, if I were left without an hole to put my head into, or a rag to cover my&mdash;body, you would give me a comfortable room in your hou&s;e, and a clean &s;hirt into the bargain.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, by the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of my cu|rate, or his wife, or &s;ome one within his gates, I am an hou&s;e out of pocket&mdash;I &s;ay, literally, out of pocket; for I mu&s;t re|build it at my own co&s;ts and charges, or the church of York, who originally gave it me, will do tho&s;e things, which in good &s;en&s;e ought not to be done; but which the wi&s;e-acres who compo&s;e it, will tell me they have a right to do. My lo&s;s will be upwards of two hundred pounds, with

<P>Now the&s;e &s;ermons of mine, were mo&s;t of them written in the very hou&s;e that is burned down, and all of them preached, I fear again and again, in the very church to which it belonged; and they now an|&s;wer

<P>That the man &s;hould have formed &s;uch an idea of me, as to &s;uppo&s;e me capable, if I did not &s;ooth his &s;orrows, of adding another to their number, wounded me &s;ore|ly.

<P>I have made my bargain for rebuilding my par&s;onage, and &s;ettled all arrange|ments with all parties concerned, in a manner more to my &s;atisfaction than I could have expected. I was rather in ha&s;te to &s;ettle this account, that there might be no ri&s;que of leaving my wife and Lydia a dilapidation for their fortune: for I have no rea&s;on to believe that the *** of *** would be more kind to them when friendle&s;s and unprotected, than they had been to the hu&s;band of the one, and the father of the other, who, when he was a poor Curate, had pride enough to de&s;pi&s;e their Reverences, and wit enough to make
<PB N="53" REF="55">
others laugh at them. But may God for|give them, as I do!&mdash;Amen.</P>
<P>I wrote to <HI>Hall</HI> an account of my di&s;|a&s;ter;&mdash;and his an&s;wer bid me find out a <HI>conceit</HI> on the occa&s;ion, and comfort my|&s;elf with it. <HI>Tully,</HI> the Orator, the Po|litician, the Philo&s;opher, the Morali&s;t, the Con&s;ul, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. adopted as he candidly tells us every one, who reads his works, this mode of con&s;olation, when he lo&s;t his daughter; and, if we may be|lieve him, with &s;ucce&s;s. Now this &s;ame <HI>Tully,</HI> you mu&s;t know, was like my fa|ther; I mean <HI>Mr. Shandy,</HI> of <HI>Shandy Hall,</HI> who was as well plea&s;ed with a misfortune that gave him an opportunity of di&s;play|ing his eloquence, as with a <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> that obliged him to hold his tongue.

<P>You mu&s;t know then, that this &s;ame friend of mine, and, I may add, of your's al&s;o, in a moment of lazy pride, took it into his head that he would have a town chariot, to &s;ave his feet by day, and to carry him to Ranelagh in the evening. For this purpo&s;e, after con&s;ulting a coach-maker, he had allotted <HI>one hundred</HI> and <HI>forty pounds;</HI> and he wrote me word of it. On my arrival in town, about three months after this communication, I found a card of invitation from <HI>Lord Spencer</HI> to dine with him on the following Sunday; and I had no &s;ooner read it, than <HI>Hall's</HI> fine crane-neck'd chariot came bounce as it were, upon my recollection; &s;o I &s;allied forth to a&s;k him how he did, and to bor|row
<PB N="55" REF="57">
his carriage, that I might pay my vi|&s;it in pomp as well as <HI>Pontificalibus.</HI> I found him at home, made a friendly en|quiry or two, and told him of the little arrangement I had formed; when he re|plied with one of his Cynical &s;miles, that his mortification was in the extreme, for that his chariot was gone po&s;t to Scotland. I &s;tared, and he laughed,&mdash;not at me, but at his own <HI>conceit;</HI> and you &s;hall have it, &s;uch as it is:</P>
<P>I mu&s;t inform you then, that at the moment when the coach-maker, was re|ceiving his la&s;t in&s;tructions, he him&s;elf re|ceived a letter; which letter acquainted him that his &s;on, who was quartered at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> had got into a terrible riot there; to get out of the con&s;equences of which, demanded almo&s;t the preci&s;e &s;um
<PB N="56" REF="58">
that had been de&s;tined for the chariot. So that the <HI>hundred and forty pounds,</HI> which had been &s;et a part to build a chariot in London, were employed to repair broken windows, broken, lamps and broken heads, in Edinburgh; and <HI>Hall</HI> comforted him&s;elf with the conceit that his chariot was gone <HI>po&s;t</HI> to <HI>Scotland.</HI> So much for comforts and conceits;&mdash;and happy is it for us when we can, by any means, <HI>conceit</HI> our&s;elves into comfort. I could &s;ay more upon this matter, but my paper is almo&s;t filled; and I have only &s;pace to expre&s;s a wi&s;h, that your life may never want any of the&s;e petty helps to make it as happy as, if I greatly mi&s;take not, it mu&s;t be honourable&mdash;Let me &s;ee you &s;oon; and, in the mean time, and at all times, may God be with you.</P>

How|ever, I &s;hed a tear over the &s;epulchre, which, if the dead could have known it, would have been more acceptable than the
<PB N="60" REF="62">
mo&s;t &s;plendid diction that ever glared on monumental alaba&s;ter.</P>
<P>I al&s;o wrote a kind of Shandean, &s;ing|&s;ong, dramatic piece of rhyme for Mr. <HI>Beard</HI>&mdash;and he &s;ung it at Ranelagh, as well as on his own &s;tage, for the benefit of &s;ome one or other. He a&s;ked for &s;ome|thing of the kind, and I knew not how to refu&s;e him; for, a year before, he had in a very re&s;pectful manner, and without any previous acquaintance, pre&s;ented me with the freedom of Covent-Garden Theatre. The act was gracious; and I liked it the better, becau&s;e the monarch of Drury-Lane had known me for &s;ome years, and be&s;ides had, for &s;ome time, occupied a front &s;eat in my page, before he offered me the freedom&mdash;not of Drury Lane hou&s;e, but of Drury-Lane pit. I told
<PB N="61" REF="63">
him, on the occa&s;ion, that he <HI>acted</HI> great things and <HI>did</HI> little ones:&mdash;&s;o he &s;tam|mered and looked fooli&s;h, and performed, at length, with a bad grace, what his ri|val manager was &s;o kind as to do with the be&s;t grace in the world&mdash;But no more of that&mdash;he is &s;o complete on the &s;tage, that I ought not to mention his patch-work off it.</P>
<P>However, to return to my &s;ubject&mdash;if I can; for digre&s;&s;ion is interwoven with my nature; and to get to my point, or find my way back to it, when I have wandered a&s;ide, as other men do, is not in the line of my faculties.&mdash;But though I may not be a poet, the clerk of my pa|ri&s;h is&mdash;not ab&s;olutely in my conceit&mdash;but, which is better, in that of his neigh|bours; and, which is the be&s;t of all&mdash;in his own. His mu&s;e is a profe&s;&s;ional one,
<PB N="62" REF="64">
for &s;he only in&s;pires him to indite hymns; and it is appropriate, for &s;he leads him to &s;uch &s;ubjects as are &s;uitable to his &s;piritual office, and which, like tho&s;e of his bre|thren <HI>Stera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ld</HI> and <HI>Hopkins,</HI> may be &s;aid or &s;ung in churches. In &s;hort, there had been a terrible di&s;ea&s;e among the cattle, and our pari&s;h had &s;uffered greatly, &s;o that this parochial bard thought it a pro|per &s;ubject for a &s;piritual &s;ong, which he accordingly compo&s;ed, and gave it out on the Sunday following, to the prai&s;e and glory of God, as an hymn of his own compo&s;ing. Not only the murrain it&s;elf, but the &s;ufferers by the calamity, were vociferated through the ai&s;les in all the pomp and devotion of ru&s;tic p&s;almody. The la&s;t &s;tanza, which is the only one I recollect, rather unhinged my devotion, but it &s;eemed to rivet that of the congre|gation,

&s;o often &s;uch a mixture of &s;arca&s;m in it, that there are many who will not believe he has a &s;ingle &s;cruple of it in his compo|&s;ition.&mdash;Nay, I am acquainted with &s;ever|al, who cannot be per&s;uaded but that he is a very in&s;en&s;ible, hard-hearted man, which I, who have known him long, and known him well, a&s;&s;ure you he is not.&mdash;He may not always po&s;&s;e&s;s the grace of charity, but he feels the reality of it, and continu|ally performs benevolent actions, though not always, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, in a benevo|lent manner.

<P>I SHALL not reply, my dear friend, to all the kind things you think and &s;ay of me.&mdash;I tru&s;t, indeed, that I de&s;erve &s;ome of them; and I am well plea&s;ed to find that you think I de&s;erve them all.&mdash;But however that may be, I de&s;ire you to cheri&s;h tho&s;e benevolent &s;entiments which you have &s;o warmly expre&s;&s;ed in the paper before me, both for your own &s;ake, and that of the per&s;on who is the &s;ubject of them.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="72">
Your commands, in general, &s;hould be obeyed without reflection&mdash;but in this par|ticular in&s;tance, a rare gleam of prudence has &s;hot acro&s;s me, and, I beg leave to reflect for a few moments on the &s;ubject&mdash;and were I to take wi&s;dom upon me, and reflect for a few days&mdash;the re&s;ult, I am &s;ure, would be, that I &s;hould not obey your commands at all.</P>
<P>The giving advice, my good friend, is the mo&s;t thankle&s;s genero&s;ity in the world&mdash;becau&s;e in the fir&s;t place, it co&s;ts you nothing; and, in the next, it is ju&s;t &s;uch a thing as the per&s;on to whom you pre&s;ent it will think that he does not want. This, you &s;ee, is my way of rea&s;oning; but I believe, from my heart, that it will apply too well to the &s;ubject between us.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="73">
There are &s;uch things in the world as <HI>wrong heads</HI> and <HI>right hearts&mdash;</HI>and <HI>wrong hearts</HI> and <HI>right heads.</HI>&mdash;Now, for my|&s;elf, and &s;peaking under the influence of my own particular feelings, I would ra|ther be of the <HI>right heart</HI> family, with all their blunders, errors and confu&s;ions; but if I want a bu&s;ine&s;s to be done, or a plan to be executed, give me the <HI>right head:</HI>&mdash;if there is a <HI>right heart</HI> into the bargain, &s;o much the better: but it is upon the <HI>former</HI> that I mu&s;t rely&mdash;and whether the latter be right or wrong, is not a matter of ab&s;olute con&s;ideration.

<P><PB N="72" REF="74">
Now, I am rather di&s;po&s;ed to think, without leaning to the uncharitable &s;ide of the que&s;tion, that poor&mdash;is of the <HI>Wrong-head</HI> family.&mdash;I know his heart&mdash;and I am &s;ure his pre&s;ent &s;crape ari&s;es from the good di&s;po&s;itions of it.

<P>YOU refine too much, my dear friend,&mdash;you do indeed.&mdash;Your rea|&s;oning is ingenious, and produces a neat, pretty, plau&s;ible train of argument, that would make a figure in a company of fe|male philo&s;ophers; but if committed to paper, would be pardonable only when written on the fan of &s;ome <HI>pedantic Dulcinea.</HI> You run into divi&s;ions, when a &s;imple modulation would an&s;wer better; that is, would produce more plea&s;ing effects both in your&s;elf, and the &s;entimental &s;pirit whom you might wi&s;h to plea&s;e.</P>

<P>YOU have hit my fancy mo&s;t won|derfully, in the account you have given me of Lady &mdash;; the Juno cha|racter not only prevails, but ab&s;olutely predominates. The <HI>Minerva</HI> qualities are all &s;econdary,&mdash;and as to any <HI>Cyprian</HI> di&s;|po&s;itions, I know nothing about them.</P>
<P>She certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a very good under&s;tanding, and is not without attain|ments; but both the one and the other
<PB N="92" REF="94">
derive all their con&s;equence from her man|ners.&mdash;She has &s;omewhat of an imperious di&s;po&s;ition, which would be either &s;ilent|ly de&s;pi&s;ed by &s;ome, or violently oppo&s;ed by others, if &s;he did not give a grace to it that annihilates any unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation that might attempt to ri&s;e in the brea&s;t of a by-&s;tander, or which is better, by|&s;itter: but this is not all, for it calls forth al&s;o, that kind of re&s;pectful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which does not le&s;&s;en us in our own opini|on for having practi&s;ed it.</P>
<P>I never, in my life, felt the merit of exterior decoration &s;o much as in my con|ver&s;ations and communications with this Lady; and I really do not know any po|&s;ition, in the pre&s;ent &s;chool of fa&s;hion, where a young man might learn &s;o much as in her drawing room, or without mean|ing

any mi&s;chievous equivoque, her dre&s;&s;|ing room.&mdash;It is really no common &s;ati&s;|faction to me to reflect that my young friend is an <HI>El&eacute;ve</HI> of &s;uch an in&s;tructre&s;s.</P>
<P>There is a time and circum&s;tance of life, and that period and circum&s;tance are now yours, when nothing but the ea&s;y, &s;ociety, and little tender friend&s;hips of an accompli&s;hed woman are wanting to ren|der a character complete:&mdash;and without &s;aying a word more than I think on the bu&s;ine&s;s,&mdash;I cannot but expre&s;s my &s;ati&s;|faction that you are in &s;uch hands as will probably produce the very effects which &s;o &s;incere a friend as my&s;elf can wi&s;h and de&s;ire.</P>
<P>It has ever been a maxim with me, &s;ince I knew any thing of the world, that
<PB N="94" REF="96">
we are all of us as much in want of a Schoolmi&s;tre&s;s at the fini&s;h, as we do at the commencement of our education. And as you are &s;o fortunate as to have Lady &mdash; to teach you the <HI>Horn-book</HI> of high life, you will bid fair to &s;pell it and put it to|gether, &s;o as to become the charm of all &s;ociety:&mdash;and you will lo&s;e, what I &s;o much wi&s;h you to lo&s;e, the attention to one, and the neglect of the many; which though there may be &s;omething amiable in the principle, is not adapted to the general intercour&s;e of life.</P>
<P>Lady M&mdash; F&mdash; might forward bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and Lady C&mdash; I am &s;ure is ready to do it&mdash;&s;o that in &s;uch a &s;oil, in &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, and with &s;uch cultivations, what has not partial friend&s;hip a right to expect. And now what can I do better than leave you

<P>I UNDERSTAND, from Mr. Phipps, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Late <HI>Lord Mulgrave.</HI></NOTE> that you are ab&s;olutely engaged to pa&s;s the Summer, or rather the Autumn, with him at <HI>Mulgrave-Hall;</HI> &s;o that I now con&s;ider a previous vi&s;it to me as a matter on which I may depend, and to which believe me, I look with real &s;atisfaction. We will while away a month or &s;ix weeks at my vicarage in a manner which, I tru&s;t, will not be unplea&s;ing or unprofitable to you.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="99">
However, in &s;aying this, or rather writ|ing it, I addre&s;s my&s;elf to the excellence of your heart, which I cannot enough ad|mire, and that cultivated under&s;tanding of which I have the greate&s;t hopes.&mdash;I know the plea&s;ures you will quit, and the &s;ocie|ties you mu&s;t &s;acrifice, to come and pa&s;s any part of the Summer with me; but, at the &s;ame time, I do not doubt of your vi&s;it,&mdash;and that a Shande an <HI>T&ecirc;te &aacute; T&ecirc;te</HI> has its charms for you</P>
<P>I remember a circum&s;tance, which I &s;hall never think of without the utmo&s;t pride in my own heart, and the mo&s;t &s;incere affection for yours;&mdash;but, be&s;ides that it flattered me in the highe&s;t degree, it proved that you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;ource of &s;entiment which, whatever may befall you in life, mu&s;t pre&s;erve you in honour and happine&s;s:&mdash;with

<P>You cannot ab&s;olutely have forgotten an evening vi&s;it which you paid me la&s;t January, in Bond Street, when I was ill in bed;&mdash;nor ought it to e&s;cape your occa&s;i|onal
<PB N="99" REF="101">
reflection that you &s;at by my bed-&s;ide the whole night, performing every act of the mo&s;t friendly and pious attention.&mdash;I then thought that the &s;care-crow death was at my heels;&mdash;nay, I thought the villain had got me by the throat,&mdash;and I told you as much.&mdash;However, it plea&s;ed Heaven, that I &s;hould not be &s;natched from the world at that moment; though I &s;poke my own hone&s;t opinion when I va|ticinated my de&s;tiny by expre&s;&s;ing little hopes of getting to the winter's end&mdash;I believe, my dear friend, &s;aid I, that I &s;hall &s;oon be off.&mdash;I hope not, you replied, with a &s;queeze of my hand and a &s;igh of your heart, which went to the very bottom of mine:&mdash;but,&mdash;you were plea&s;ed to add le&s;t that &s;hould be the ca&s;e, I hope you will do me the favour to let me be always with you, that I may have every atom of

<P>I &s;poke no reply, for I could not,&mdash;but my heart made one then, and will continue to do &s;o,&mdash;till it is become <HI>a clod of the Valley.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it is, that I do not doubt but you will quit the ring of plea&s;ure without re|gret, to come and &s;it with me beneath my Honey-Suckle, which is now flaunting like a Ranelagh beauty, and accompany me in paying my nuns their pen&s;ive evening vi&s;it.&mdash;We can go to ve&s;pers with them, and return home to our curds and cream with more delicious &s;entiments than all the plea&s;ures of the world, and the
<PB N="101" REF="103">
beauties thereof, in their vaine&s;t moments, can truly afford.</P>
<P>I am bu&s;y about another couple of vo|lumes to amu&s;e, and, as I hope, to in&s;truct a gouty and a &s;plenetic world;&mdash;in which, I &s;olemnly declare, I have no Ambition to remain, but for the love I bear to &s;uch friends as you; and, perhaps, the vanity, which I am vain enough not to call an idle one, of adding a few more leaves to the wreath which I have been able to weave for my own little glory.</P>
<P>Come, then, and let me read the pages to you as they fall from my pen; and be a <HI>Mentor</HI> to <HI>Tri&s;tram,</HI> as you have been to <HI>Yorick.</HI>&mdash;At all events,&mdash;I am &s;ure you cannot come to York without coming to me; and I &s;hall triumph completely over

<P>I envy, however, your &s;aunter together round an <HI>empty Ranelagh,</HI> though I &s;hould

<P>You will, I am &s;ure, more than under|&s;tand me when I mention that &s;en&s;e of fe|male perfection,&mdash;I mean, however, when the female is &s;itting or walking be&s;ide you,&mdash;which &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the mind that the whole Globe &s;eems to be occupied by none but two.&mdash;When your hearts, in perfect uni&s;on, or, I &s;hould rather &s;ay, harmony with each other, produce the &s;ame chords,&mdash;and blo&s;&s;om with the &s;ame flowers of thought and &s;entiment.</P>
<P>The&s;e hours,&mdash;which virtuous, tender minds have the power of &s;eparating from

There is &s;omething, my dear friend, mo&s;t wonderfully plea&s;ant in the idea of getting away from the world;&mdash;and though I have ever found it a great comfort, yet I have been more vain of the bu&s;ine&s;s, when I have done it in the mid&s;t of the world.&mdash;But this <HI>aberration</HI> from the crowd, while you are &s;urrounded and pre&s;&s;ed by it, is only to be accompli&s;hed by the magic of female perfection.&mdash;Friend&s;hip, with all its powers,&mdash;mere friend&s;hip, can|not do it.&mdash;A more refined &s;entiment mu&s;t employ its influence to wrap the heart in this delicious oblivion.&mdash;It is too plea&s;ing to la&s;t long,&mdash;for envious, &s;leeple&s;s care is ever on the watch to awake us from the bewitching trance.</P>
<P>You, my friend, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;omething of the reality of it: and I, while I enjoy your

from the tenor of your letter, which is now be&s;ide me, that you have been made a dupe of by &s;ome artful per&s;on&mdash;who, I am di&s;po&s;ed to think, is &s;ome <HI>cunning bag|gage</HI>&mdash;and that, under the impre&s;&s;ions of this game that has been played you, your vanity is alarmed, and your under&s;tanding piqued; and then, you lay all this dire grievance, in a very petti&s;h manner, let me tell you, at the door of your &s;en&s;ibili|ty.

Sen&s;ibility is oftentimes betrayed into a fooli&s;h thing;&mdash;but its folly is amiable, and &s;ome one or other is the better for it.

<P>There is a certain race of people, who are ever aiming to treat their betters in &s;ome &s;curvy way or other&mdash;but it has ever been a practice with me, not to mind a little dirt thrown upon my coat,&mdash;&s;o that I keep my <HI>lining unrumpled.</HI>&mdash;And &s;o much for that envy, ignorance and ill-na|ture, for which, what I have written, is far too much.</P>

<P>IF you wi&s;h to have the repre&s;entation of my &s;pare, meagre-form&mdash;which, by the bye, is not worth the canvas it mu&s;t be painted on&mdash;you &s;hall be mo&s;t welcome to it; and I am happy in the reflection, that when my bones &s;hall be laid low, there may be any re&s;emblance of me, which may re|call my image to your friendly and &s;ympa|thizing recollection.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="124">
But you mu&s;t mention the bu&s;ine&s;s to <HI>Reynolds</HI> your&s;elf; for I will tell you why I cannot. He has already painted a very excellent portrait of me, which, when I went to pay him for, he de&s;ired me to ac|cept, as a tribute, to u&s;e his own elegant and flattering expre&s;&s;ion, that his heart wi&s;hed to pay to my genius. That man's way of thinking and manners, are at lea&s;t equal to his pencil.</P>
<P>You &s;ee therefore the delicacy of my &s;ituation, as well as the nece&s;&s;ity, if the genius of <HI>Reynolds</HI> is to be employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s, of your taking it entirely up|on your&s;elf.

Or why not your little friend <HI>Co&s;way,</HI> who is ri&s;ing fa&s;t into fame and fortune. But be it as you plea&s;e, and arrange it ac|cording to your own fancy.</P>
<P>At all events, I &s;hall treat my&s;elf when I get to Rome with my own bu&s;to, if <HI>Nollikens</HI> does not make a demand for it that may be incon&s;i&s;tent with my Exche|quer. The &s;tatuary decorations of my grandfather the Archbi&s;hop's monument, in the Cathedral at York, which you admire &s;o much, have given birth, I believe, to this whim of mine; and this piece of mar|ble, which my vanity&mdash;for let it be vanity if you plea&s;e&mdash;de&s;tines for my&s;elf, may be placed by the hand of friend&s;hip, and by yours perhaps, near my grave&mdash;and &s;o much for that.</P>

<P>THE &s;tory, my dear friend, which you heard related, with &s;uch an air of autho|rity, is like many other true &s;tories, ab&s;o|lutely fal&s;e. Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> and I never had a di&s;pute&mdash;I mean a &s;erious, angry or petulant di&s;pute, in our lives:&mdash;indeed I &s;hould be mo&s;t exceedingly &s;urprized to hear that <HI>Da|vid</HI> ever had an unplea&s;ant contention with any man;&mdash;and if I &s;hould be made to be|lieve that &s;uch an event had happened, no|thing
<PB N="127" REF="129">
would per&s;uade me that his oppo|nent was not in the wrong: for, in my life, did I never meet with a being of a more placid and gentle nature; and it is this a|miable turn of his character, that has giv|en more con&s;equence and force to his &s;cep|tici&s;m, than all the arguments of his &s;o|phi&s;try.&mdash;You may depend on this as a truth.</P>
<P>We had, I remember well, a little plea|&s;ant &s;parring at Lord <HI>Hertford</HI>'s table at <HI>Paris;</HI> but there was nothing in it that did not bear the marks of good-will and urba|nity on both &s;ides.&mdash;I had preached that very day at the Amba&s;&s;ador's Chapel, and <HI>David</HI> was di&s;po&s;ed to make a little merry with the <HI>Par&s;on;</HI> and, in return, the Par|&s;on was equally di&s;po&s;ed to make a little
<PB N="128" REF="130">
mirth with the <HI>Infidel;</HI> we laughed at one another, and the company laughed with us both&mdash;and, whatever your informer might pretend, he certainly was not one of that company.</P>
<P>As for his other hi&s;tory, that I preached an offen&s;ive &s;ermon at the Amba&s;&s;ador's Chapel&mdash;it is equally founded in truth; for Lord Hertford did me the honour to thank me for it again and again. The <HI>text,</HI> I will own, was an <HI>unlucky</HI> one, and that was all your informer could have heard to have ju&s;tified his report.&mdash;If he fell a&s;leep immediately after I repeated it&mdash;I will forgive him.</P>
<P>The fact was as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="131">
Lord <HI>Hertford</HI> had ju&s;t taken and fur|ni&s;hed a magnificent <HI>Hotel;</HI> and as every thing, and any thing gives the fa&s;hion of the moment at Paris, it had been the fa&s;h|ion for every one to go to &s;ee the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador's new hotel.&mdash;It occupied the curio&s;ity, formed the amu&s;ement, and gave a &s;ubject of conver&s;ation to the polite cir|cles of Paris, for a fortnight at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Now it fell to my lot, that is to &s;ay, I was reque&s;ted to preach, the fir&s;t day &s;er|vice was performed in the chapel of this new hotel.&mdash;The me&s;&s;age was brought me when I was playing a &s;ober game of Whi&s;t with the <HI>Thornhills,</HI> and whether it was that I was called rather abruptly from my after|noon's amu&s;ement to prepare my&s;elf for this bu&s;ine&s;s, for it was to be on the next day;
<PB N="130" REF="132">
or from what other cau&s;e I do not pretend to determine, but that unlucky kind of fit &s;eized me, which you know I can never re|&s;i&s;t, and a very unlucky text did come into my head,&mdash;and you will &s;ay &s;o when you read it. <Q REND="margQuotes">"And Hezekiah &s;aid unto the Prophet, I have &s;hewn them my ve&s;&s;els of gold, and my ve&s;&s;els of &s;ilver, and my wives and my concubines, and my boxes of ointment, and whatever I have in my hou&s;e, have I &s;hewn unto them: and the Prophet &s;aid unto Hezekiah, thou ha&s;t done very fooli&s;hly."</Q></P>
<P>Now, as the text is a part of Holy writ, that could not give offence; though wick|ed wits are &s;ometimes di&s;po&s;ed to ill-treat
<PB N="131" REF="133">
it with their own &s;curvy mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions.&mdash;And as to the di&s;cour&s;e it&s;elf, no|thing could be more innocent, and <HI>David Hume</HI> favoured it with his grace and ap|probation.</P>
<P>But here I am got, I know not how, writing about my&s;elf for whole pages toge|ther&mdash;whereas the only part of my letters that can ju&s;tify my being an egoti&s;t, is, when I a&s;&s;ure any gentle &s;pirit, or faith|ful friend, as I now do you, that I am her, or his, or your</P>

<P>BELIEVE me, my dear friend, I have no great faith in Doctors. Some eminent ones of the faculty a&s;&s;ured me, ma|ny years ago, that if I continued to do as I was then doing, I &s;hould not live three months. Now the fact is, that I have been doing exactly what they told me I ought not to do, for thirteen years together&mdash;and here I am, as thin, it is true, but as &s;au|cy
<PB N="133" REF="135">
as ever; and it will not be my fault, if I do not continue to give them the lie for another period of equal duration.</P>
<P>It is Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> I think, who ob&s;erves,&mdash;at lea&s;t be it who it may that made the ob&s;ervation, it is not unworthy the great man who&s;e name I have ju&s;t written&mdash;That Phy&s;icians are old women, who &s;it by your bed-&s;ide till they kill you, or Nature cures you.</P>
<P>There is an uncertainty in the bu&s;ine&s;s that often baffles experience, and renders genius abortive&mdash;Tho' I mean not, believe me, to be &s;evere on a &s;cience which is &s;ome|times made the means of doing good. Nay, the &s;cience it&s;elf con&s;idered, naturally and phy&s;ically, is the eye of all the re&s;t. But
<PB N="134" REF="136">
I do not always hold my peace when I re|flect on tho&s;e &s;elf-conceited, up&s;tart pro|fe&s;&s;ors of it, who fly and bounce, and give them&s;elves airs, if you do not read the directions upon the label of a phial, which contains the matter of their pre&s;criptions, with as much reverence, as if it had been penned by St. <HI>Luke</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Godde&s;s of Health&mdash;let me drink thy healing and &s;u&s;taining beverage at the pure fountain which flows at thy command!

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedne&s;day Noon.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM always getting into a &s;crape, not from a carele&s;ne&s;s of offending, as &s;ome good-humoured people have &s;u&s;pect|ed, for I do not wi&s;h to give offence, but from the want of being under&s;tood.&mdash;Pope has well expre&s;&s;ed the hard&s;hip of being forced<Q><L>&mdash;to trudge</L>
<L>Without a &s;econd and without a judge.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139">
I think the quotation is correct.&mdash;Indeed, a man may proceed well enough without a &s;econd. Genius is oftentimes &s;o far from wanting &s;uch an a&s;&s;i&s;tant, that it is fre|quently clogged by it;&mdash;but to be without a judge is a mortification which comes home with much &s;everity to the bo&s;oms of tho&s;e who feel, or fancy, which is pretty near the &s;ame thing, that judgment&mdash;I mean impartial, adequate judgment, would be their reward.</P>
<P>To be eternally mi&s;under&s;tood, and which naturally follows, to be eternally mi&s;repre&s;ented by ignorance, is far, far wor&s;e than to be &s;landered by malice.&mdash;Calumny is more than oftentimes, for it is almo&s;t always the &s;acrifice which vice pays to virtue, and folly offers up to wi&s;|dom.&mdash;A wi&s;e man while he pities the ef|forts
<PB N="138" REF="140">
of &s;lander, will feel a kind of con&s;e|quence from the exertion of them;&mdash;like the philo&s;opher who is &s;aid to have rai&s;ed a monument to his own fame, with the &s;tones, which the malignity of his compe|titors had thrown at him.</P>
<P>The divorce between virtue and repu|tation is too common to be wondered at&mdash;though it is too unju&s;t not to be la|mented: but that being a circum&s;tance which connects it&s;elf with &s;omething like the general order of Providence, we are able to con&s;ole our&s;elves under it, by hope and re&s;ignation. But in the little, and comparatively &s;peaking, the petty bu|&s;ine&s;s of human fame&mdash;the mind may be ju&s;tified in kicking at the perver&s;ions to which its hone&s;t and be&s;t endeavours are &s;o continually &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="141">
I do mo&s;t &s;incerly a&s;&s;ure you, that I have &s;eldom been &s;o proud of my&s;elf and the little di&s;play of my talents,&mdash;whatever they may be&mdash;as I was in the very cir|cum&s;tance which has given &s;o much un|ea&s;ine&s;s. I intended no &s;everity&mdash;I was all complacency and good humour&mdash;my &s;pirits were in uni&s;on with every generous and gracious thought,&mdash;and, &s;o far was I from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the idea of giving offence&mdash;<HI>and to a Lady &mdash;</HI> that there never was a moment of my life, perhaps, when I was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed to buckle on my armour, and mount my <HI>Ro&s;inante,</HI> to go and fight the cau&s;e of injured or captive beauty.&mdash;But in&s;tead of all this, here am I con&s;idered as the very mon&s;ter whom I my&s;elf was ready to combat and to de&s;troy.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="142">
You will, therefore, be &s;o good as to communicate the&s;e thoughts, in as much better a manner as you plea&s;e, to Mrs. H&mdash;, and a&s;&s;ure her, that &s;he has only done what &s;o many have done before her&mdash;that is, &s;he has <HI>mi&s;conceived,</HI> or, as that word may produce a <HI>mi&s;conception</HI>&mdash;&s;he has <HI>mi&s;under&s;tood</HI> me.</P>
<P>So far I am mo&s;t willing to travel in the high-way of apology; and, if &s;he is di&s;po&s;ed to &s;mile, I will receive her re|turning favour, with all due acknow|ledgments; but if &s;he &s;hould think it clever, or witty, or con&s;equential, to con|tinue to be offended&mdash;I will not fail to remember her in a po&s;t&s;cript to my chap|ter on the right and wrong end of a wo|man;
<PB N="141" REF="143">
which, though my uncle Toby, from a certain combination of circum|&s;tances could never be made to under|&s;tand, I will explain to the world in &s;uch a manner, that they who run may read.</P>
<P>I am not, however, unintelligible to all. There are &s;ome &s;pirits who want no key either to my &s;peech or my wri|tings; and they&mdash;I mean the &s;pirits&mdash;are of the fir&s;t order. This is &s;ome comfort, and that comfort increa&s;es both in its weight and mea&s;ure, on the re|flection that you are one of them.</P>
<P>But my paper and po&s;tman's bell both warn me to do&mdash;what I ought to have done at lea&s;t a page ago&mdash;

<SALUTE>MY DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I recommend it to you,&mdash;not, perhaps, above all things, but very a&s;&s;uredly above mo&s;t things,&mdash;to &s;tick to your own under&s;tanding a little more than you do; for, believe me, an ounce of it will an|&s;wer your purpo&s;e better than a pound weight of other people's. There is a cer|tain timidity which renders early life ami|able,
<PB N="149" REF="151">
as a matter of &s;peculation; but is very inconvenient indeed, not to &s;ay dan|gerous, according to the pre&s;ent humour of the world, in matters of practice.</P>
<P>There is a manly confidence, which, as it &s;prings from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing certain excellent qualities and valuable at|tainments, we cannot have too early; and there is no more impropriety in offering manife&s;tations of it to the world, than the putting on your helmet in the day of bat|tle. We want it as a protection&mdash;I &s;ay as a protection, from the in&s;ults and inju|ries of others; for, in your particular cir|cum&s;tances, I con&s;ider it merely as a defen|&s;ive quality&mdash;to prevent you from being run down, or run over, by the fir&s;t ignorant blockhead or in&s;olent coxcomb, who per|ceives
<PB N="150" REF="152">
your mode&s;ty to be a re&s;traint on your &s;pirit.</P>
<P>But this by the way.&mdash;The application of it is left to your own di&s;cernment and good &s;en&s;e, of which I &s;hall not write what I think, and what &s;ome others think, who&s;e te&s;timony will wear well.</P>
<P>I am &s;o much better plea&s;ed &s;ince I &s;et my foot on the Continent, that it would do you good to &s;ee&mdash;and more good &s;till to hear me; for I have recovered my voice in this genial climate; and &s;o far am I now from finding a difficulty to make my&s;elf heard acro&s;s the table, that I am almo&s;t fit to preach in a cathedral.</P>
<P>Here they are all hey&mdash;go&mdash;mad.&mdash;The vintage has been abundant, and is now at
<PB N="151" REF="153">
the clo&s;e. Every eye beams delight, and every voice is attuned to joy.&mdash;Though I am running away as fa&s;t as I can well go, and am withal &s;o pre&s;&s;ed by the ra&s;cal, death! that I ought not in prudence to take time to look behind me; yet cannot I re&s;i&s;t the temptation of getting out of my chai&s;e, and &s;itting for a whole evening on a bank, to &s;ee tho&s;e happy people dance away the la|bours of the day: and thus they contrive, for two or three hours at lea&s;t out of the four and twenty, <HI>to forget,</HI> God ble&s;s 'em, that there are &s;uch things as labour and care in the world.</P>
<P>This innocent oblivion of &s;orrow is one of the happie&s;t arts of life; and philo&s;o|phy, in all its &s;torehou&s;e of human reme|dies, has nothing like unto it. Indeed, I
<PB N="152" REF="154">

<P>I have travelled hither mo&s;t deliciou&s;ly&mdash;though I have made my journey in a <HI>d&eacute;&s;obl&eacute;geant,</HI> and of cour&s;e, alone. But when the heart is at re&s;t, and the mind is in harmony with it&s;elf, and every &s;ubordinate feeling is well attuned, not an object of|fers it&s;elf to the attention but may be made to produce plea&s;ure&mdash;Be&s;ides, &s;uch is the character of this happy people, that you

&s;ee a &s;mile on every countenance, and hear the notes of joy from every tongue.&mdash;There is an old woman, at this moment, playing on the viol before my window, and a groupe of young people are dancing to it, with more appearance, and, I believe, more <HI>reality</HI> of plea&s;ure, than all your brilliant a&s;&s;emblies at <HI>Almack</HI>'s can boa&s;t.</P>
<P>I love my country as well as any of her children&mdash;and I know the &s;olid, characte|ri&s;tic virtues of its people;&mdash;but they do not play the game of happine&s;s with that attention or &s;ucce&s;s which is practi&s;ed and obtained here.&mdash;I &s;hall not enter into the phy&s;ical or moral difference between the two nations&mdash;but I cannot, however, help ob&s;erving that, while the French po&s;&s;e&s;s

<P>Nay, how often have I &s;een at a <HI>York A&s;&s;embly,</HI> two young people dance down thirty couple, with as grave countenances as if they did it for hire, and were, after all, not &s;ure of being paid: and here have I beheld the &s;un-burnt &s;ons and daughters of labor ri&s;e from their &s;canty meal with not a pul&s;e in their hearts that did not beat to plea&s;ure;&mdash;and, with the brighte&s;t looks of &s;atisfaction, make their wooden &s;hoes re|&s;pon&s;ive to the &s;ound of a broken-winded hautboy.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="159">
All the world &s;hall never per&s;uade me there is not a Providence, and a gracious one too, which governs it.

<P>It is not, as you well know, my practice to icratch out any thing I write, or I would

<P>I HAVE a great mind to have done with joking, laughing and merry-making, for the re&s;t of my days, with either man, woman, or child; and &s;et up for a grave, formal, &s;ee-&s;aw character; and di&s;pen&s;e &s;tu|pid wi&s;dom, as I have hitherto been &s;aid to have done &s;en&s;ible non&s;en&s;e, to my coun|try-men and country-women.</P>
<P>To tell you the truth&mdash;I began this let|ter ye&s;terday morning, and was interrupt|ed
<PB N="161" REF="163">
in getting to the end of it, by half a do|zen idle people, who called upon me to lounge and to laugh; though one of them forced me home with him to dine with his &s;i&s;ter, whom I found to be a being of a &s;u|perior order, and who has ab&s;olutely made the &s;omething like a re&s;olution with which I began this letter, not worth the feather of the quill with which it was written.</P>
<P>She is, in good faith, charming beyond my powers of de&s;cription; and we had &s;uch an evening, as made the cup of tea &s;he gave me more delicious than nectar.</P>
<P>By the bye, &s;he wi&s;hes very much to be|come acquainted with you&mdash;not, believe me, from any repre&s;entations or biography of mine, but from the warm encomiums &s;he
<PB N="162" REF="164">
has received of you from others, and tho&s;e, as &s;he &s;ays, of the fir&s;t order. After all this, however, you may be &s;ure that my te&s;timony was not wanting.&mdash;So that, when you will give an opportunity, I &s;hall have the honour of pre&s;enting you to ki&s;s her hand, and add another devout wor&s;hipper at the temple of &s;uch tran&s;cendant merit.</P>
<P>I am really of opinion that, if there is a woman in the world formed to do you good, and to make you love her into the bar|gain&mdash;which, I believe, is the only way of doing you any good&mdash;this is the pre-emi|nent and bewitching character.&mdash;Indeed, were you to command my &s;eeble powers to deliniate the lovely being who&s;e affections would well repay thee for all the heart-achs and di&s;quieting apprehen&s;ions that may and will afflict thee in thy pa&s;&s;age through life,

it would be this fair and excellent creature. <HI>My Knight Errant</HI> &s;pirit has already told her that &s;he is a <HI>Dulcinea</HI> to me&mdash;but I would mo&s;t willingly take off my armour and break my &s;pear, and re&s;ign her as an <HI>Angel</HI> to you.</P>
<P>I need not &s;ay any thing, I tru&s;t, of my affection for you; and I have, ju&s;t now, &s;ome &s;ingular ideas on your &s;ubject, which kept me awake la&s;t night, when I ought to have been found a&s;leep&mdash;but I &s;hall re&s;erve them for the communication of my fire|&s;ide, or your's, as it may be; and I wi&s;h, as devoutly as ever I wi&s;hed any thing in my life, that my fire was to brighten before you this very evening.</P>

<P>I Felt the full force of an hone&s;t heart-ach on reading your la&s;t letter.&mdash;The &s;tory it contains may be placed among the mo&s;t affecting relations of human calamity, and the happie&s;t efforts of human benevolence. I happened to have it in my pocket ye&s;ter|day morning when I breakfa&s;ted with Mrs. M&mdash;; and, for want of &s;omething &s;o good of my own, I read the whole of your letter to her,&mdash;but this is not all; for, what

is more to the purpo&s;e, (that is, to the purpo&s;e of your honour) &s;he de&s;ired to read it her&s;elf, and then &s;he entreated me not to delay the earlie&s;t opportunity to pre&s;ent <HI>you</HI> to her breakfa&s;t-table, and the mi&s;tre&s;s of it to you. I told her of the aukward di&s;|tance of an hundred miles, at lea&s;t, that lay between us; but I promi&s;ed and vowed,&mdash;for I was obliged to do both,&mdash;that the mo|ment I could lay hold of your arm, I would lead you to <HI>her ve&s;tibule.</HI>&mdash;I really begin to think I &s;hall get &s;ome credit by you.</P>
<P>Love, I mo&s;t readily acknowledge, is &s;ubject to violent paroxy&s;ms, as well as &s;low fevers; but there is &s;o much plea&s;ure at|tendant upon the pa&s;&s;ion in general, and &s;o many amiable &s;ympathies are connected with it; nay,&mdash;it is &s;ometimes &s;o &s;uddenly, and oftentimes &s;o ea&s;ily cured, that I can|not,

The mind that is bowed down by unmerited calamity, and knows not from what point of the com|pa&s;s to expect any good, is in a &s;tate, over which the Angel of pity &s;heds all his &s;how|ers&mdash;<HI>Unable to dig, and to beg a&s;hamed</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="172" REF="174">
what a de&s;cription!&mdash;what an object for relief;&mdash;and how great the rapture to re|lieve it!</P>
<P>I do not, my dear boy,&mdash;indeed I do not&mdash;envy your feelings, for I tru&s;t that I &s;hare them; but if it were po&s;&s;ible for me to envy you any thing that does you &s;o much honour, and makes me love you, if po&s;&s;i|ble, &s;o much better than I did before&mdash;it is the little fabric of comfort and happine&s;s which you have erected in the depths of mi&s;ery. The whole may occupy, perhaps, but little &s;pace in this world&mdash;but, like the mu&s;tard &s;eed, it will grow up and rear its head towards that Heaven, to which the Spi|rit that planted it will finally conduct you.</P>
<P><HI>Robin&s;on</HI> called upon me ye&s;terday, to take me to dinner in <HI>Berkeley-&s;quare;</HI>&mdash;

Nay, as his wine warmed him, he talked loud, and threat|ened to drink water&mdash;like you&mdash;the re&s;t of his days.</P>
<P>But while I am relating &s;o many fine things to flatter <HI>your vanity,</HI> let me, I be|&s;eech you, mention &s;omething to flatter my own;&mdash;and this is neither more or le&s;s than a very elegant &s;ilver &s;tandi&s;h, with a motto engraved upon it, which has been &s;ent me by <HI>Lord Spencer.</HI> This mark of that Nobleman's good di&s;po&s;ition towards

<P>THERE is a certain pliability of the affections, my dear friend, which, with all its inconveniences,&mdash;and I will ac|knowledge a thou&s;and,&mdash;forms a wonder|ful charm in the human character.&mdash;To become a dupe to others, who are almo&s;t always wor&s;e, and, very often, more ig|norant than your&s;elf, is not only mortify|ing to one's pride, but frequently de&s;truc|tive to one's fortune. Neverthele&s;s, there
<PB N="176" REF="178">
is &s;omething, in the very face, and, which is wor&s;e, in the mind, of &s;u&s;picion, of &s;uch a dete&s;table complexion and character, that I could never bear it; and whenever I have ob&s;erved mi&s;tru&s;t in the heart, I would never rap at the door of it, even to pay, if I could help it, a morning vi&s;it, much le&s;s to take my lodging there.</P>
<Q>Niger e&s;t, hune tu Romane caveto.</Q>
<P>This &s;ort of cullibility mo&s;t certainly lays you open to the de&s;igns of knaves and ra&s;cals; and they are, alas! to be found in the hedges and highway &s;ides, and will come in without the trouble of &s;ending for them.&mdash;The happy mean between mad good|nature and mean &s;elf-love, is of difficult attainment; though Mr. Pope &s;ays,&mdash;
<PB N="177" REF="179">
that <HI>Lord Bathur&s;t</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it in an emi|nent degree,&mdash;and I believe it. Indeed, it is for my honour that I &s;hould believe it, as I have received much kindne&s;s, and many generous attentions from that venerable, and excellent nobleman:&mdash;as I never po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed this happy quality my&s;elf, I can only recommend it to you, without offering any in&s;tructions on a duty, of which I cannot offer my&s;elf as an example.&mdash;This is not altogether clerical,&mdash;I mean as clergy|men do,&mdash;but no matter.</P>
<P>B&mdash; is exactly one of the&s;e harm|le&s;s, inoffen&s;ive people, who never frets or fumes, but bears all his lo&s;&s;es with a mo&s;t Chri&s;tian patience, and &s;ettles the ac|count in this manner,&mdash;that he had rather lo&s;e any thing than that benevolence of di&s;|po&s;ition,
<PB N="178" REF="180">
which forms the happine&s;s of his life. But how will all this end?&mdash;for you know, as I know, that when once you have won his good opinion, you may im|po&s;e upon him ten times a day,&mdash;if nine did not &s;uit your purpo&s;e. The real friends of virtue, of honour, and what is be&s;t in the human character, &s;hould form a phalanx round &s;uch a man, and pre&s;erve him from the harpy plottings of &s;harpers and vil|lains.</P>
<P>But there is another &s;pecies of cullibility that I never can be brought to pity, which ari&s;es from the continual aim to make culls of others. It is not that gentle, confiden|tial, un&s;u&s;picious &s;pirit, which I have al|ready hinted to you, but an overweening, wicked, in&s;idious di&s;po&s;ition, which, by
<PB N="179" REF="181">
being continually engaged in the mi&s;erable bu&s;ine&s;s of deceiving others, either outwits it&s;elf, or is outwitted by the very objects of its own fallacious intentions.</P>
<P>There is not, believe me, a more &s;traight way to the being a dupe your&s;elf, than the re&s;ting your hopes or plea&s;ure <HI>in making dupes of others.</HI></P>
<P>Cunning is not an honourable qualifi|cation; it is a kind of left-handed wi&s;dom, which even fools can &s;ometimes practi&s;e, and villains always make the foundation of their de&s;igns:&mdash;But, alas! how often does it betray its votaries to their di&s;honour, if not to their de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Though an occa&s;ional &s;tratagem may be &s;ometimes innocent, I am ever di&s;po&s;ed
<PB N="180" REF="182">
to &s;u&s;pect the cau&s;e where it mu&s;t be em|ployed; for, after all, you will, I am &s;ure, agree with me, that where artifice is not to be condemned <HI>as a crime,</HI> the nece&s;&s;ity, which demands it, mu&s;t be con&s;idered <HI>as a misfor|tune.</HI></P>

<P>THERE is a certain kind of offence which a man may,&mdash;nay, which he ought to forgive:&mdash;But &s;uch is the jealous honour of the world, that there is a &s;ort of injury, commonly called an affront, which, if it proceeds from a certain line of cha|racter, mu&s;t be revenged.&mdash;But let me en|treat thee to remember that hardne&s;s of heart is not worth thine anger, and would
<PB N="188" REF="190">
di&s;grace thy vengeance.&mdash;To turn upon a man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, would not, like <HI>Saint Paul,</HI> be kicking again&s;t the pricks,&mdash;but, which is far wor&s;e, again&s;t a flint.&mdash;Thou did&s;t right, therefore my dear boy,&mdash;in letting the matter pa&s;s as thou ha&s;t done.</P>
<P>As far as my ob&s;ervation has reached, and the circle of it is by no means, a nar|row one&mdash;an hard heart is always a coward|ly heart.&mdash;Genero&s;ity and courage are a&s;|&s;ociate virtues; and the character which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the former, mu&s;t, in the nature of mental arrangements, be adorned with the latter.</P>
<P>If I perceive a man to be capable of do|ing a mean action,&mdash;if I &s;ee him imperious and tyrannical; if he takes advantage of
<PB N="189" REF="191">
the weak to oppre&s;s, or of the poor to grind, or of the downca&s;t to in&s;ult,&mdash;or is continually on the hunt after excu&s;es not to do what he ought,&mdash;I determine &s;uch a man, though he may have fought fifty du|els, to be a coward.&mdash;It is by no means a proof that a man is brave becau&s;e he does not refu&s;e to fight;&mdash;for we all know that cowards have fought, nay,&mdash;that cowards have conquered,&mdash;but a coward never per|formed a generous or a noble action:&mdash;and thou ha&s;t my authority to &s;ay,&mdash;and thou mighte&s;t find a wor&s;e, that a hard-hearted character never was a brave one. I &s;ay, thou may&s;t ju&s;tly call &s;uch a man a coward,&mdash;and, if he &s;hould be &s;pirited into a re|&s;entment of thy words&mdash;fear him not.&mdash;<HI>Tri&s;tram</HI> &s;hall brighten his armour, and &s;cour the ru&s;t from off his &s;pear, and aid thee in the combat.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192">
And now let me a&s;k thee, my good friend, how it happens that thy fancy has of late taken to the Dormitory.&mdash;I thought the very names of <HI>Petrarch</HI> and <HI>Laura,</HI> and the enchanting &s;cene of <HI>Vauclu&s;a's</HI> fountain, which is &s;uch a cla&s;&s;ical &s;pot to all tender minds, mu&s;t have in&s;pired thee with a flow of &s;entiment, that would have meandered through every page of thy la&s;t letter;&mdash;but in&s;tead of it, here have I been &s;aluted with a &s;tring, of &s;tiff, &s;tarched notions of ho|nour, and God knows what&mdash;that you could have found no where but in conver|&s;ing with the young Lords in great peri|wigs,&mdash;and the old Ladies in bouncing fardingals,&mdash;who have &s;o long inhabited&mdash;'s long, long Gallery.</P>

But if you &s;hould con&s;ider this as a pre|&s;umption, I will quit tho&s;e beauties which belong only to early life, and make my ap|plication to qualities, which are of every period, and po&s;&s;e&s;s that lengthened charm, which makes one overlook the wrinkles of age, and turns the hoary hair into Auburn Tre&s;&s;es. That you will always po&s;&s;e&s;s the one as you now do the other, I have heard acknowledged wherever I have heard your name mentioned: nor do I remember that your prai&s;e was ever accompanied with the exception of a &s;ingle <HI>but</HI>&mdash;from any of the many various forms and &s;hapes, which en|vy plants in every corner to &s;narl at excel|lence.</P>

<P>THAT woman is a timid animal, I am mo&s;t ready, my dear friend, to ac|knowledge,&mdash;but, like other timid animals, is more dangerous, in certain &s;ituations, than tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater degree of natural courage.&mdash;I would, therefore, coun|&s;e thee for this, among a thou&s;and other rea&s;ons, never to make a woman thine ene|my, if thou can&s;t po&s;&s;ibly help it.&mdash;Not that
<PB N="197" REF="199">
I &s;u&s;pect thee to be capible of an uncour|teous act, to any of the lovelier &s;ex,&mdash;on the contrary, I think thee qualified, and di&s;po&s;ed too, beyond mo&s;t men I ever knew, to charm them, and do them good: and it is, perhaps, on that, as much as any other account, that I warn thee again&s;t giv|ing them offence.&mdash;For I have more than once ob&s;erved, and mentioned with &s;ome concern, a propen&s;ity in thy character to collect thy warm affections in one particu|lar circle, and to be carele&s;s of, which, as it relates to women, is the &s;ame thing as to be ungracious to tho&s;e, who are not inclu|ded in it.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething amiable,&mdash;nay, there may be &s;omething noble in the principle of &s;uch a conduct; but it is too refined for
<PB N="198" REF="200">
a world like our's; in which, &s;hort as life is, we may ea&s;ily live long enough, to find the inconvenience and di&s;tre&s;s of it. He who attaches him&s;elf entirely to one object&mdash;or even to a few,&mdash;may, from ingrati|tude, caprice, or death, be &s;oon left alone: and he will come with an ill-grace, when nece&s;&s;ity compels him, to &s;eek for kindne&s;s and &s;ociety, where he formerly appeared to di&s;dain both.</P>
<P>If a &s;mall cohort of friends could be cer|tain of continuing together, till they all &s;unk, into one common grave, your pre&s;ent theory might form not only a gallant, and a plea&s;ant, but a practica|ble &s;y&s;tem; this, however, my dear fellow, cannot be, and, as for living alone when all our friends are gone, it is neither more, or le&s;s, than making life a living tomb,
<PB N="199" REF="201">
which, in my mind, is far,&mdash;far wor&s;e, than a dead one.</P>
<P>But to return to my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Woman is a timid animal,&mdash;and, there|fore, I tru&s;t and am &s;ure thy generous na|ture, laying a&s;ide every other con&s;ideration, will never do any thing de&s;ignedly to di&s;|tre&s;s it.&mdash;Indeed, it does not appear to me, that there can be a po&s;&s;ible &s;ituation, which will ju&s;tify any kind of inattention to the &s;ex, that may give them pain.&mdash;For be a&s;&s;ured, and I will re&s;t my experience of woman kind, of which I am not a little proud, on the opinion, that the pa&s;&s;ion for any individual of the &s;ex, whatever her per|fections may be, which makes thee relax in thy gracious behaviour to the re&s;t, will
<PB N="200" REF="202">
never promote thy real happine&s;s:&mdash;it may afford thee a certain &s;ea&s;on, though I be|lieve a very &s;hort one, of tumultuous rap|ture, and then thou wilt awake from thy delirium, to all the grievances of a fretful &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Women look at lea&s;t for attentions;&mdash;they con&s;ider them as an inherent birth|right, given to their &s;ex by the laws of po|li&s;hed &s;ociety; and when they are deprived of them, they mo&s;t certainly have a right to complain&mdash;and will be, one and all, di&s;po&s;ed to practi&s;e that revenge, which is not, by any means, to be treated with con|tempt. It would be very unplea&s;ant for me to hear in any female &s;ociety, that my friend was a &s;trange, eccentric, &s;ingular, unplea&s;ant character;&mdash;and I rather think that he him&s;elf would not be plea&s;ed to find,
<PB N="201" REF="203">
that &s;uch a de&s;cription was given, and be|lieved of him.&mdash;I do not mean to urge,&mdash;indeed, I well know you cannot &s;u&s;pect me of &s;o gro&s;s an error,&mdash;that the &s;ame regard is to be equally dealt to all: this is far from being my &s;y&s;tem;&mdash;<HI>but I affirm on the other hand&mdash;that all are not to be di&s;regarded for one;</HI> for it will &s;eldom happen, that the affection of that one, will recompen&s;e thee for the enmity of all the re&s;t.&mdash;Love one, if you plea&s;e, and as much as you plea&s;e&mdash;but, be gracious to all.</P>
<P>Affection may, &s;urely, conduct thee through an avenue of women, to her who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es thy heart, without tearing the flounces of any of their petticoats. The di&s;playing courte&s;y to all whom you meet, will delay you very little in your way, to
<PB N="202" REF="204">
the arms of her whom you love&mdash;and, if I mi&s;take not, will attune your &s;en&s;ibili|ties, to the higher enjoyment of the rap|tures you will find there.</P>
<P>We have all of us, enemies enough, my good friend, from the inevitable cour&s;e of human events, without our encrea&s;ing the number by &s;o &s;trange, and unprofitable conduct, as that of neglecting any of the mo&s;t trifling offices of familiar life.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides,&mdash;to come more home to thine heart,&mdash;let me ob&s;erve to thee,&mdash;that cha|rity, and humanity, which, by the bye, are one, and the &s;ame thing, are &s;aid to be the foundation of tho&s;e qualities, which form what is called a well-bred man.&mdash;If, therefore, you &s;hould, on any account,
<PB N="203" REF="205">
get into the habit of neglecting the latter,&mdash;you may &s;tand more than a chance of its being &s;aid, that you do not po&s;&s;e&s;s the former, which, you know to be the bright|e&s;t jewel in the human character.&mdash;And this I am certain would wound thee in thy very &s;oul.</P>
<P>&mdash;My dear boy, neglect not the&s;e, and other things, which, thou may&s;t call, lit|tle things;&mdash;for little things, believe me, are, oftentimes, of great importance, in the arrangements of life.</P>
<P>You have been frequently plea&s;ed to tell me, as a matter of prai&s;e, that, in my de&s;criptions, I am natural to a nicety,&mdash;and, when I tell of picking up an hand|kerchief, or wiping a tear from the cheek
<PB N="204" REF="206">
of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed dam&s;el, with a white one&mdash;or the &s;ticking a pin into a pincu&s;hion,&mdash;and &s;uch things, I am far &s;uperior to any other writer.&mdash;Apply then, I be&s;eech thee, this ob&s;ervation to thy&s;elf, and give me an opportunity of retorting the eulogi|um upon thee. This, is the &s;incere wi&s;h of thy friend.</P>

<P>This moderation of temper, which is always a&s;&s;ociated to &s;terling merit, is made to win the love of the few, but is too apt, at the &s;ame time, to be not only the dupe, but the contempt of the many.
