<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Character of Mr. <HI>Addi|&s;on</HI> and his Writings, for Ju&s;t|ne&s;s of thought, Strength of rea&s;oning, and Purity of &s;tyle, is too well e&s;tabli&s;h'd to need a Recommendation; but their great|e&s;t Ornament, and that which gives a Lu&s;tre to all the re&s;t, is his appear|ing, throughout, a zealous Advocate for Virtue and Religion again&s;t Pro|fanene&s;s and Infidelity. And becau&s;e his excellent Di&s;cour&s;es upon tho&s;e Subjects lie di&s;per&s;ed among his other Writings, and are by that means not &s;o generally known and read as they de&s;erve, it was judg'd to be no un&s;ea|&s;onable Service to Religion at this
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
time, to move the Book&s;eller to pub|li&s;h them together in a di&s;tinct Vo|lume; in hopes, that the Politene&s;s and Beauty peculiar to Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s Writings would make their way to per&s;ons of a &s;uperior Character and a more liberal Education; and, that as they come from the hands of a <HI>Lay|man,</HI> they may be the more readily re|ceiv'd and con&s;ider'd by young Gentle|men, as a proper <HI>Manual of Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Our modern Scepticks and Infi|dels are great Pretenders to Rea&s;on and Philo&s;ophy, and are willing to have it thought that none who are really po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of tho&s;e Talents, can ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ent to the Truth of Chri&s;ti|anity. But it falls out very unfortu|nately for them and their Cau&s;e, that tho&s;e per&s;ons within our own memory, who are confe&s;s'd to have been the mo&s;t perfect Rea&s;oners and Philo&s;ophers of their time, are al&s;o known to have been firm Believ|ers, and they, <HI>Laymen</HI>; I mean Mr. BOYLE, Mr. LOCK, Sir ISAAC
<PB N="v" REF="5">
NEWTON, and Mr. ADDISON: who, mode&s;tly &s;peaking, were <HI>as</HI> good Thinkers and Rea&s;oners, as the be&s;t among the Scepticks and Infidels at this day. Some of them might have their particular Opinions about this or that point in Chri&s;tianity, which will be the ca&s;e as long as men are men; but the thing here in&s;i&s;ted on, is, That they were <HI>accurate Rea&s;oners,</HI> and at the &s;ame time <HI>firm Believers.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. BOYLE, the mo&s;t exact Search|er into the Works of Nature that any Age has known, and who &s;aw Athei&s;m and Infidelity beginning to &s;hew them|&s;elves in the loo&s;e and voluptuous reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, pur&s;u'd his Philo&s;ophical Enquiries with Religious Views, to e&s;tabli&s;h the minds of men in a firm belief and thorow &s;en&s;e of the infinite Pow|er and Wi&s;dom of the great Creator.</P>
<P>This account we have from one who was intimately ac|quainted with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Burnet.</HI></NOTE> and preach'd his fu|neral
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
Sermon:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Life,</HI> p. 22.</NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'It appear'd to tho&s;e who convers'd with him in his Enquiries into Nature, that his main de&s;ign in that (on which as he had his own eye mo&s;t con|&s;tantly, &s;o he took care to put others often in mind of it) was to rai&s;e in him&s;elf and others, va&s;ter thoughts of the Greatne&s;s and Glory, and of the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of God. This was &s;o deep in his thoughts, that he concludes the Article of his Will, which relates to that Illu&s;tri|ous Body, the Royal Society, in the&s;e Words: <HI>wi&s;hing them a happy &s;ucce&s;s in their laudable Attempts, to di&s;cover the true nature of the</HI> Works of God; <HI>and praying, that they and all other Searchers into</HI> Phy&s;ical <HI>Truths, may cordially refer their At|tainments to the</HI> Glory <HI>of the</HI> great Author of Nature, <HI>and to the Com|fort of Mankind.</HI>'</Q>
The &s;ame per&s;on al&s;o &s;peaks thus of him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">He had the profounde&s;t Veneration for the great God of Heaven and Earth,
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
that ever I ob&s;erv'd in any per&s;on. The very name of GOD was never mention'd by him without a Pau&s;e and a vi&s;ible Stop in his Di&s;cour&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>And, of the &s;trictne&s;s and exem|plarine&s;s of the whole cour&s;e of his life, he &s;ays,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 9.</NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">I might here challenge the whole Tribe of <HI>Libertines,</HI> to come and view the U&s;efulne&s;s, as well as the Ex|cellence of the Chri&s;tian Religion, in a Life that was entirely dedicated to it.</Q></P>
<P>Again&s;t the <HI>Athei&s;ts,</HI> he wrote his <HI>Free Enquiry into the receiv'd Notion of Nature</HI> (to confute the pernicious Principle of a&s;cribing Effects to <HI>Na|ture,</HI> which are only produced by the infinite Power and Wi&s;dom of God;) and al&s;o his <HI>E&s;&s;ay about</HI> final <HI>Cau&s;es of things Natural,</HI> to &s;hew that all things in nature were made and contriv'd with great order, and every thing for its proper End and U&s;e, by an all-wi&s;e Creator.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the <HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> he wrote a Trea|ti&s;e <HI>of Things above Rea&s;on</HI>; in which
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
he makes it appear that &s;everal things which we judge to be contrary to Rea|&s;on, becau&s;e <HI>above</HI> the reach of our Under&s;tanding, are not therefore to be thought unrea&s;onable, becau&s;e we can|not comprehend them, &s;ince they may be apparently rea&s;onable to a greater and more comprehen&s;ive Under&s;tand|ing. And he wrote another Treati&s;e, to &s;how the Po&s;&s;ibility of the <HI>Re&s;ur|rection of the &s;ame Body.</HI></P>
<P>The Veneration he had for the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> appears not only from his &s;tudying them with great Exact|ne&s;s, and exhorting others to do the &s;ame; but more particularly from a di&s;tinct Treati&s;e which he wrote, on purpo&s;e to defend the <HI>Scripture-Style,</HI> and to an&s;wer all the objections which Profane and Irreligious per&s;ons have made again&s;t it. And &s;peaking of Mo|rality con&s;ider'd as a Rule of Life, he &s;ays,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Life,</HI> p. 17.</NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">I have formerly taken pains to peru&s;e Books of Mo|rality; yet &s;ince they have only a power to <HI>per&s;uade,</HI> but not to <HI>command,</HI> and
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
Sin and Death do not nece&s;&s;arily attend the Di&s;obedience of them, they have the le&s;s Influence; for &s;ince we may take the liberty to que&s;tion human Writers, I find that the methods they take to impo&s;e their Writings upon us, may &s;erve to countenance either Truth or Fal&s;hood.</Q></P>
<P>His Zeal to <HI>propagate</HI> Chri&s;tianity in the World, appears by many and large Benefactions to that end; which are enumerated in his Funeral Sermon:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">He was at the Charge of the Tran&s;lation and Impre&s;&s;ion of the New Te&s;tament into the <HI>Malayan</HI> Language,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Life,</HI> p. 36.</NOTE> which he &s;ent over all the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> He gave a noble Reward to him that tran&s;lated <HI>Grotius</HI>'s incomparable Book of the <HI>Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion</HI> into <HI>Arabick,</HI> and was at the Charge of a whole Impre&s;&s;ion, which he took care to order to be di&s;tributed in all the Countries where that Language is under&s;tood. He was re&s;olved to have carried on the impre&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="x" REF="10">
New Te&s;tament in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Lan|guage; but the Company thought it became them to be the Doers of it, and &s;o &s;uffer'd him only to give a large &s;hare towards it.&mdash; He was at &s;even hundred Pounds charge in the Edition of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Bi|ble,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Life</HI> p. 37.</NOTE> which he ordered to be di|&s;tributed in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and he contribu|ted largely both to the Impre&s;&s;ions of the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Bible, and of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Bible in <HI>Scotland.</HI> He gave during his Life three hundred Pounds to advance the de&s;ign of propagating the Chri&s;tian Religion in <HI>America</HI>; and as &s;oon as he heard that the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company were entertain|ing Propo&s;itions for the like de&s;ign in the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> he pre&s;ently &s;ent an hun|dred Pounds for a Beginning and an Example, but intended to carry it much further, when it &s;hould be &s;et on foot to purpo&s;e. He had de&s;ign|ed, tho' &s;ome Accidents did upon great con&s;iderations divert him from &s;ettling it during his Life, but not
<PB N="xi" REF="11">
from ordering it by his Will, that a liberal Provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for one, who &s;hould in a very few well-dige&s;ted Sermons, every year &s;et forth the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion, in General, without de|&s;cending to the Subdivi&s;ions among&s;t Chri&s;tians; and who &s;hould be changed every third Year, that &s;o this noble Study and Employment might pa&s;s through many Hands, by which means many might be|come Ma&s;ters of the Argument.</Q></P>
<P>In his younger years, he had thoughts of entring into <HI>Holy Orders,</HI> and one rea&s;on that determin'd him again&s;t it, was, that he believed he might in &s;ome re&s;pects be more &s;er|viceable to Religion, by continuing a Layman;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">His having no Intere&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Life,</HI> p. 37.</NOTE> with relation to Religion, be&s;ides tho&s;e of &s;a|ving his own Soul, gave him, as he thought, a more un&s;u&s;pected Au|thority in writing or acting on that Side. He knew the Prophane Crew
<PB N="xii" REF="12">
fortified them&s;elves again&s;t all that was &s;aid by Men of our Profe&s;&s;ion, with this, that it was their Trade, and that they were paid for it: He hoped therefore that he might have the more Influence, the le&s;s he &s;hared in the Patrimony of the Church.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. LOCK, who&s;e accurate Ta|lent in rea&s;oning is &s;o much celebra|ted even by the <HI>Scepticks</HI> and <HI>Infi|dels</HI> of our Times, &s;how'd his Zeal for Chri&s;tianity, fir&s;t, in his middle age, by publi&s;hing a Di&s;cour&s;e on pur|po&s;e to demon&s;trate the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of believing Je&s;us to be the pro|mis'd Me&s;&s;iah; and, after that, in the la&s;t years of his Life, by a very judicious Commentary upon &s;everal of the Epi&s;tles of St. <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;peaks of the MIRACLES wrought by our Saviour and his Apo|&s;tles, in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, both as Facts unexceptionably true, and as

<P>To tho&s;e who ask, <HI>What need was there of a Saviour? What Advantage have we by Je&s;us Chri&s;t?

and &s;hort Views may utterly incapa|citate us to judge. We know little of this Vi&s;ible, and nothing at all of the State of that Intellectual World (wherein, are infinite numbers and de|grees of Spirits out of the reach of our ken or gue&s;s,) and therefore know not what Tran&s;actions there were be|tween God and our Saviour, in refe|rence to his Kingdom. We know not what need there was to &s;et up a Head and a Chieftain, in oppo&s;ition to</HI> THE PRINCE OF THIS WORLD, THE PRINCE OF THE POWER OF THE AIR, &amp;c. <HI>whereof there are more than ob&s;cure intimations in Scripture. And we &s;hall take too much upon us, if we &s;hall call God's Wi&s;dom or Provi|dence to Account, and pertly condemn for needle&s;s, all that our weak, and perhaps bia&s;&s;ed</HI> UNDERSTANDING, <HI>cannot account for.</HI> And then he &s;hews at large the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> there was of the Go&s;pel-Revelation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid. 260.</NOTE> to deliver the World from the mi&s;erable State of Darkne&s;s and

He was never weary of admiring the great Views of that Sacred Book, and the ju&s;t relation of all its parts. He

This is what I can &s;ay upon experience, and what you will find to be true, when you come to make up the account.</HI></P>
<P>Sir ISAAC NEWTON, univer&s;ally acknowledged to be the able&s;t Philo|&s;opher and Mathematician that this or perhaps any other Nation has produc'd, is al&s;o well known to have been a firm Believer, and a Serious Chri&s;tian. His di&s;coveries concerning the frame and Sy&s;tem of the Univer&s;e, were apply'd by him, as Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Enquiries into Nature had been, to demon&s;trate a|gain&s;t <HI>Athei&s;ts</HI> of all kinds, the Being of a God, and to illu&s;trate his Power and Wi&s;dom in the Creation of the World. Of which a better account
<PB N="xxi" REF="21">
cannot be given, than in the words of an ingenious Per&s;on who has been much conver&s;ant in his Philo&s;ophical Writings:<NOTE PLACE="marg">View of his Philo&s;ophy, <HI>p. 405.</HI></NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">At the end of his Mathematical Princi|ples of Natural Philo&s;ophy, he has given us his thoughts concerning the Deity. Wherein he fir&s;t ob&s;erves, that the &s;imilitude found in all parts of the univer&s;e, makes it undoubted, that the whole is governed by one &s;upreme Being, to whom the origi|nal is owing of the frame of nature, which evidently is the effect of choice and de&s;ign. He then pro|ceeds briefly to &s;tate the be&s;t meta|phy&s;ical notions concerning God. In &s;hort, we cannot conceive either of Space or Time otherwi&s;e than as nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;ting; this Being there|fore, on whom all others depend, mu&s;t certainly exi&s;t by the &s;ame ne|ce&s;&s;ity of nature.

<PB N="xxii" REF="22">
&s;hould have had a beginning, the Deity mu&s;t be both immen&s;e and eternal.</Q></P>
<P>This great Man apply'd him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t attention to the &s;tudy of the Holy <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and con&s;ider'd the &s;everal parts of them with an un|common Exactne&s;s; particularly, as to the order of Time, and the &s;eries of Prophecies and Events relating to the Me&s;&s;iah. Upon which head, he has left behind him an elaborate Di&s;|cour&s;e, to prove that the famous Pro|phecy of <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Weeks, which has been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly perverted by the DEISTS of our times, was an expre&s;s Prophecy of the coming of the Me&s;|&s;iah, and fulfill'd in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. ADDISON, &s;o de&s;ervedly cele|brated for an uncommon accuracy in Thinking and Rea&s;oning, has given abundant proof of his firm belief of Chri&s;tianity and his Zeal again&s;t Infi|dels of all kinds, in the Writings that are here publi&s;h'd; of which it is <HI>cer|tainly</HI>

<P>I mention not the&s;e great Names, nor the Te&s;timonies they have given of their firm belief of the Truth of Chri&s;tianity, as if the Evidences of our Religion were to be finally re&s;olv'd into human Authority, or try'd in any other way than by the known and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Rules of right Rea&s;on; but my de&s;ign in mentioning them, is</P>

<P N="2">2. The Remembrance of this will al|&s;o be a means, on one hand, to hinder well-meaning people from being <HI>mi&s;|led</HI> by the vain Boa&s;ts of our modern <HI>Pretenders</HI> to Rea&s;on; and, on the
<PB N="xxiv" REF="24">
other hand, to check the <HI>Inclination</HI> of the wicked and vicious to be mi&s;|led; when both of them have before their eyes &s;uch fre&s;h and eminent In|&s;tances of &s;ound Rea&s;oning and a firm Faith, join'd together in one and the &s;ame mind.</P>
<P N="3">3. Further, as the&s;e were per&s;ons generally e&s;teem'd for Virtue and Goodne&s;s, and, notwith&s;tanding their high Attainments, remarkable for their Mode&s;ty and Humility; their Exam|ples &s;hew us, that a &s;trong and clear Rea&s;on naturally leads to the belief of Revelation, when it is not under the Influences of Vice, or Pride.</P>
<P N="4">4. And, finally, as they are all <HI>Lay|men,</HI> there is no room for the Ene|mies of Reveal'd Religion to alledge, that they were prejudiced by Intere&s;t, or &s;ecular Con&s;iderations of any kind. A &s;ugge&s;tion, that has really no weight, when urg'd again&s;t the writings of the <HI>Clergy</HI> in defence of Revelation, &s;ince they do not de&s;ire to be tru&s;ted upon their own Authority, but upon the
<PB N="xxv" REF="25">
Rea&s;ons they offer; and Lawyers and Phy&s;icians are not le&s;s tru&s;ted, becau&s;e they <HI>live</HI> by their Profe&s;&s;ions; but it is a &s;ugge&s;tion that ea&s;ily takes hold of weak minds, and e&s;pecially &s;uch as catch at objections, and are <HI>willing</HI> to be caught by them. And, con&s;ider|ing the Diligence of the Adver&s;ary in making Pro&s;elytes and drawing Men from the Faith of Chri&s;t; equal di|ligence is requir'd of tho&s;e who are to maintain that Faith, not only to leave men no real <HI>ground,</HI> but even no <HI>colour</HI> or <HI>pretence,</HI> for their Infide|lity.</P>
<P>The following Di&s;cour&s;es, except that concerning the Evidences of the Chri&s;tian Religion, were all publi&s;hed in &s;eparate Papers &s;ome years ago, and afterwards collected into Volumes, with marks of di&s;tinction at the end of ma|ny of them, to point out the Writers, Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s are there di&s;tingui&s;h'd by &s;ome one of the Letters of the word CLIO; and the &s;ame marks of di&s;tin|ction are here continued; as are al&s;o
<PB N="xxvi" REF="26">
the re&s;t, where any Letter was found at the end of the Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e Volumes, they &s;tand ac|cording to the order of time in which they were at fir&s;t &s;eparately publi&s;h'd, without any Connexion as to the mat|ters contain'd in them; but here, the &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es on the &s;ame Subject, which lie di&s;pers'd in tho&s;e Papers, are reduced to their proper Heads, and put into one view, that the whole may be more regularly read, and each head may leave a more la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind of the Reader.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> General divi&s;ion of the following di&s;cour&s;e, with regard to <HI>Pagan</HI> and <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Authors, who mention particulars relating to our Saviour.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> Not probable that any &s;uch &s;hould be mentioned by <HI>Pagan</HI> Writers who lived at the &s;ame time, from the Nature of &s;uch tran&s;actions.</P>

<P N="6"><PB N="2" REF="30"><HI>VI.</HI> And becau&s;e many books of that age are lo&s;t.</P>

<P N="8"><HI>VIII.</HI> A &s;econd record of probable, though not undoubted, authority.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. _THAT I may lay before you a full &s;tate of the &s;ub|ject under our con&s;idera|tion, and methodize the &s;everal particulars that I touched upon in di&s;cour&s;e with you; I &s;hall fir&s;t take notice of &s;uch <HI>Pagan</HI> Au|thors as have given their te&s;timony to the hi&s;tory of our Saviour; reduce the&s;e Au|thors under their re&s;pective cla&s;&s;es, and &s;hew what authority their te&s;timonies car|ry with them. Secondly, I &s;hall take no|tice of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author did not live to write this &s;econd Part.</NOTE> <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Authors in the &s;ame light.</P>
<P N="2">II. There are many rea&s;ons, why you &s;hould not expect that matters of &s;uch a wonderful nature &s;hould be taken notice of by tho&s;e eminent <HI>Pagan</HI> writers, who were contemporaries with <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> or by tho&s;e who lived before his Di&s;ciples had per&s;onally appeared among them, and a&s;|certained
<PB N="3" REF="31">
the report which had gone a|broad concerning a life &s;o full of miracles.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing &s;uch things had happened at this day in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> or among the <HI>Gri&s;ons,</HI> who make a greater figure in <HI>Europe</HI> than <HI>Judaea</HI> did in the <HI>Roman</HI> Em|pire, would they be immediately believed by tho&s;e who live at a great di&s;tance from them? or would any certain ac|count of them be tran&s;mitted into fo|reign countries, within &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time as that of our Saviour's publick mini&s;try? Such kinds of news, though never &s;o true, &s;eldom gain credit, till &s;ome time after they are tran&s;acted and expo&s;ed to the examination of the cu|rious, who by laying together circum|&s;tances, atte&s;tations, and characters of tho&s;e who are concerned in them, either receive, or reject what at fir&s;t none but eye-witne&s;&s;es could ab&s;olutely believe or disbelieve. In a ca&s;e of this &s;ort, it was natural for men of &s;en&s;e and learning to treat the whole account as fabulous, or at farthe&s;t to &s;u&s;pend their belief of it, until all things &s;tood together in their full light.</P>
<P N="3">III. Be&s;ides, the <HI>Jews</HI> were branded not only for &s;uper&s;titions different from all the religions of the <HI>Pagan</HI> world, but
<PB N="4" REF="32">
in a particular manner ridiculed for be|ing a credulous People; &s;o that whatever reports of &s;uch a nature came out of that country, were looked upon by the heathen world as fal&s;e, frivolous, and improbable.</P>
<P N="4">IV. We may further ob&s;erve, that the ordinary practice of Magic in tho&s;e times, with the many pretended Prodigies, Di|vinations, Apparitions, and local Mira|cles among the Heathens, made them le&s;s attentive to &s;uch news from <HI>Judaea,</HI> 'till they had time to con&s;ider the nature, the occa&s;ion, and the end of our Saviour's miracles, and were awakened by many &s;urprizing events to allow them any con|&s;ideration at all.</P>
<P N="5">V. We are indeed told by St. <HI>Mat|thew,</HI> that the fame of our Saviour, du|ring his life, went throughout all <HI>Syria,</HI> and that there followed him great multi|tudes of people from <HI>Galilee, Judaea, De|capolis, Idumaea,</HI> from beyond <HI>Jordan,</HI> and from <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon.</HI> Now had there been any hi&s;torians of tho&s;e times and places, we might have expected to have &s;een in them &s;ome account of tho&s;e wonderful tran&s;actions in <HI>Judaea</HI>; but there is not any &s;ingle Author extant, in any kind, of that age, in any of tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="5" REF="33">VI. How many books have peri&s;hed in which po&s;&s;ibly there might have been mention of our Saviour? Look among the <HI>Romans,</HI> how few of their writings are come down to our times? In the &s;pace of two hundred years from our Saviour's birth, when there was &s;uch a multitude of writers in all kinds, how &s;mall is the number of Authors that have made their way to the pre&s;ent age?</P>
<P N="7">VII. One authentick Record, and that the mo&s;t authentick heathen Record, we are pretty &s;ure is lo&s;t. I mean the ac|count &s;ent by the Governor of <HI>Judaea,</HI> under whom our Saviour was judged, condemned, and crucified. It was the cu&s;tom in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, as it is to this day in all the governments of the world, for the praefects and vice-roys of di&s;tant provinces to tran&s;mit to their So|veraign a &s;ummary relation of every thing remarkable in their admini&s;tration. That <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> in his account, would have touched on &s;o extraordinary an e|vent in <HI>Judaea,</HI> is not to be doubted; and that he actually did, we learn from <HI>Ju|&s;tin Martyr,</HI> who lived about a hundred years after our Saviour's death, re&s;ided, made Converts, and &s;uffered martyrdom
<PB N="6" REF="34">
at <HI>Rome,</HI> where he was engaged with Philo&s;ophers, and in a particular manner with <HI>Cre&s;cens</HI> the <HI>Cynick,</HI> who could ea&s;i|ly have detected, and would not fail to have expo&s;ed him, had he quoted a Re|cord not in being, or made any fal&s;e ci|tation out of it. Would the great Apo|logi&s;t have challenged <HI>Cre&s;cens</HI> to di&s;pute the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity with him be|fore the <HI>Roman</HI> Senate, had he forged &s;uch an evidence? or would <HI>Cre&s;cens</HI> have refu&s;ed the challenge, could he have tri|umphed over him in the detection of &s;uch a forgery? To which we mu&s;t add, that the Apology, which appeals to this Re|cord, was pre&s;ented to a learned Empe|ror, and to the whole body of the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Senate. This Father in his apology, &s;peaking of the death and &s;uffering of our Saviour, refers the Emperor for the truth of what he &s;ays to the acts of <HI>Pon|tius Pilate,</HI> which I have here mentioned. <HI>Tertullian,</HI> who wrote his Apology about fifty years after <HI>Ju&s;tin,</HI> doubtle&s;s referred to the &s;ame Record, when he tells the Governor of <HI>Rome,</HI> that the Emperor <HI>Tiberius</HI> having received an account out of <HI>Pale&s;tine</HI> in <HI>Syria</HI> of the Divine per|&s;on, who had appeared in that country,
<PB N="7" REF="35">
paid him a particular regard, and threat|ned to puni&s;h any who &s;hould accu&s;e the Chri&s;tians; nay, that the Emperor would have adopted him among the Deities whom they wor&s;hipped, had not the Senate re|fu&s;ed to come into his propo&s;al. <HI>Tertulli|an,</HI> who gives us this hi&s;tory, was not only one of the mo&s;t learned men of his age, but what adds a greater weight to his autho|rity in this ca&s;e, was eminently skilful and well read in the laws of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. Nor can it be &s;aid, that <HI>Tertul|lian</HI> grounded his quotation upon the au|thority of <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr,</HI> becau&s;e we find he mixes it with matters of fact which are not related by that Author. <HI>Eu&s;e|bius</HI> mentions the &s;ame ancient Record, but as it was not extant in his time, I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon his authority in this point. If it be objected that this parti|cular is not mentioned in any <HI>Roman</HI> Hi|&s;torian, I &s;hall u&s;e the &s;ame argument in a parallel ca&s;e, and &s;ee whether it will carry any force with it. <HI>Ulpian</HI> the great <HI>Roman</HI> Lawyer gathered together all the Imperial Edicts that had been made a|gain&s;t the Chri&s;tians. But did any one ever &s;ay that there had been no &s;uch E|dicts, becau&s;e they were not mentioned
<PB N="8" REF="36">
in the hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Emperors? Be&s;ides, who knows but this circum&s;tance of <HI>Tibe|rius</HI> was mention'd in other hi&s;torians that have been lo&s;t, though not to be found in any &s;till extant? Has not <HI>Suetonius</HI> many particulars of this Emperor omitted by <HI>Tacitus,</HI> and <HI>Herodian</HI> many that are not &s;o much as hinted at by either? As for the &s;purious <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Pilate,</HI> now extant, we know the occa&s;ion and time of their wri|ting, and had there not been a true and authentick Record of this nature, they would never have been forged.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The &s;tory of <HI>Agbarus</HI> King of <HI>Ede&s;&s;a,</HI> relating to the letter which he &s;ent to our Saviour, and to that which he received from him, is a Record of great authority; and though I will not in&s;i&s;t upon it, may venture to &s;ay, that had we &s;uch an evidence for any fact in <HI>Pagan</HI> hi&s;tory, an Author would be thought very unrea&s;onable who &s;hould reject it. I believe you will be of my opinion, if you will peru&s;e, with other Authors, who have appeared in vindica|tion of the&s;e letters as genuine, the addi|tional arguments which have been made u&s;e of by the late famous and learned Dr. <HI>Grabe,</HI> in the &s;econd volume of his <HI>Spi|cilegium.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. WE now come to con&s;ider what undoubted authorities are ex|tant among <HI>Pagan</HI> writers; and here we mu&s;t premi&s;e, that &s;ome parts of our Saviour's hi&s;tory may be rea&s;onably ex|pected from <HI>Pagans.</HI> I mean &s;uch parts as might be known to tho&s;e who lived at a di&s;tance from <HI>Judaea,</HI> as well as to tho&s;e who were the followers and eye-witne&s;&s;es of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="38">II. Such particulars are mo&s;t of the&s;e which follow, and which are all atte&s;ted by &s;ome one or other of tho&s;e heathen Authors, who lived in or near the age of our Saviour and his di&s;ciples. <HI>That</HI> Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar <HI>had ordered the whole em|pire to be cen&s;ed or taxed,</HI> which brought our Saviour's reputed parents to <HI>Bethle|hem:</HI> This is mentioned by &s;everal <HI>Ro|man</HI> hi&s;torians, as <HI>Tacitus, Suetonius,</HI> and <HI>Dion. That a great light, or a new &s;tar appeared in the ea&s;t, which directed the wi&s;e men to our Saviour:</HI> This is recorded by <HI>Chalcidius. That</HI> Herod, <HI>the King of</HI> Pa|le&s;tine, <HI>&s;o often mentioned in the</HI> Roman <HI>hi&s;tory, made a great &s;laughter of innocent children,</HI> being &s;o jealous of his &s;ucce&s;|&s;or, that he put to death his own &s;ons on that account: This character of him is given by &s;everal hi&s;torians, and this cruel fact mentioned by <HI>Macrobius,</HI> a heathen Author, who tells it as a known thing, without any mark or doubt upon it. <HI>That our Saviour had been in</HI> Egypt: This <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> though he rai&s;es a mon&s;trous &s;to|ry upon it, is &s;o far from denying, that he tells us our Saviour learned the arts of magic in that country. <HI>That</HI> Pontius Pi|late <HI>was Governor of</HI> Judaea, <HI>that our Sa|viour
<PB N="11" REF="39">
was brought in judgment before him, and by him condemned and crucified:</HI> This is recorded by <HI>Tacitus. That many miracu|lous cures and works out of the ordinary cour&s;e of nature were wrought by him:</HI> This is confe&s;&s;ed by <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo&s;tate, <HI>Por|phyry,</HI> and <HI>Hierocles,</HI> all of them not only <HI>Pagans,</HI> but profe&s;&s;ed enemies and per&s;e|cutors of Chri&s;tianity. <HI>That our Saviour foretold &s;everal things which came to pa&s;s according to his predictions:</HI> This was at|te&s;ted by <HI>Phlegon</HI> in his annals, as we are a&s;&s;ured by the learned <HI>Origen</HI> again&s;t <HI>Cel|&s;us. That at the time when our Saviour died, there was a miraculous darkne&s;s and a great earthquake:</HI> This is recorded by the &s;ame <HI>Phlegon</HI> the <HI>Trallian,</HI> who was like|wi&s;e a <HI>Pagan</HI> and Freeman to <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperor. We may here ob&s;erve, that a native of <HI>Trallium,</HI> which was not &s;ituate at &s;o great a di&s;tance from <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> might very probably be informed of &s;uch remark|able events as had pa&s;&s;ed among the <HI>Jews</HI> in the age immediately preceding his own times, &s;ince &s;everal of his countrymen with whom he had conver&s;ed, might have re|ceived a confu&s;ed report of our Saviour before his crucifixion, and probably liv|ed within the Shake of the earthquake,
<PB N="12" REF="40">
and the Shadow of the eclip&s;e, which are recorded by this Author. <HI>That</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>was wor&s;hipped as a God among the Chri&s;tians; that they would rather &s;uffer death than bla&s;pheme him; that they received a &s;acra|ment, and by it entered into a vow of ab|&s;taining from &s;in and wickedne&s;s,</HI> conform|able to the advice given by St. <HI>Paul; that they had private a&s;&s;emblies of wor&s;hip, and u&s;ed to join together in Hymns:</HI> This is the account which <HI>Pliny</HI> the younger gives of Chri&s;tianity in his days, about &s;eventy years after the death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and which agrees in all its circum&s;tances with the accounts we have in holy writ, of the fir&s;t &s;tate of Chri&s;tianity after the cruci|fixion of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. <HI>That St.</HI> Pe|ter, <HI>who&s;e miracles are many of them re|corded in holy writ, did many wonderful works,</HI> is owned by <HI>Julian</HI> the apo&s;tate, who therefore repre&s;ents him as a great Magician, and one who had in his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion a book of magical &s;ecrets left him by our Saviour. <HI>That the devils or evil &s;pirits were &s;ubject to them,</HI> we may learn from <HI>Porphyry,</HI> who objects to Chri&s;ti|anity, that &s;ince <HI>Je&s;us</HI> had begun to be wor&s;hipped, <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> and the re&s;t of the gods did no more conver&s;e with men.
<PB N="13" REF="41">
Nay, <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> him&s;elf affirms the &s;ame thing in effect, when he &s;ays, that the power which &s;eemed to re&s;ide in Chri&s;tians, proceeded from the u&s;e of certain names, and the invocation of certain daemons. <HI>Origen</HI> remarks on this pa&s;&s;age, that the Author doubtle&s;s hints at tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who put to flight evil &s;pirits, and healed tho&s;e who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with them; a fact which had been often &s;een, and which he him&s;elf had &s;een, as he declares in an|other part of his di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t <HI>Cel&s;us.</HI> But at the &s;ame time he a&s;&s;ures us, that this miraculous power was exerted by the u&s;e of no other name but that of <HI>Je|&s;us,</HI> to which were added &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in his hi&s;tory, but nothing like any invo|cation to <HI>Daemons.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> was &s;o hard &s;et with the re|port of our Saviour's miracles, and the confident atte&s;tations concerning him, that though he often intimates he did not believe them to be true, yet know|ing he might be &s;ilenced in &s;uch an An|&s;wer, provides him&s;elf with another re|treat, when beaten out of this; namely, that our Saviour was a magician. Thus he compares the feeding of &s;o many thou|&s;ands at two different times with a few
<PB N="14" REF="42">
loaves and fi&s;hes, to the magical fea&s;ts of tho&s;e <HI>Egyptian</HI> impo&s;tors, who would pre|&s;ent their &s;pectators with vi&s;ionary en|tertainments that had in them neither &s;ub&s;tance nor reality: which, by the way, is to &s;uppo&s;e, that a hungry and fainting multitude were filled by an ap|parition, or &s;trengthned and refre&s;hed with &s;hadows. He knew very well that there were &s;o many witne&s;&s;es and actors, if I may call them &s;uch, in the&s;e two mi|racles, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to refute &s;uch multitudes, who had doubtle&s;s &s;uf|ficiently &s;pread the fame of them, and was therefore in this place forced to re|&s;ort to the other &s;olution, that it was done by magic. It was not enough to &s;ay that a miracle which appeared to &s;o many thou&s;and eye-witne&s;&s;es was a forgery of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s di&s;ciples, and therefore &s;uppo|&s;ing them to be eye-witne&s;&s;es, he endea|vours to &s;hew how they might be de|ceived.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The unconverted heathens, who were pre&s;&s;ed by the many authorities that confirmed our Saviour's miracles, as well as the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> who had actual|ly &s;een them, were driven to account for them after the &s;ame manner: For, to
<PB N="15" REF="43">
work by magic in the heathen way of &s;peaking, was in the language of the <HI>Jews</HI> to ca&s;t out devils by <HI>Beelzebub</HI> the Prince of the devils. Our Saviour, who knew that unbelievers in all ages would put this perver&s;e interpretation on his mira|cles, has branded the malignity of tho&s;e men, who contrary to the dictates of their own hearts &s;tarted &s;uch an unrea|&s;onable objection, as a bla&s;phemy again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, and declared not only the guilt, but the puni&s;hment of &s;o black a crime. At the &s;ame time he conde|&s;cended to &s;hew the vanity and emptine&s;s of this objection again&s;t his miracles, by repre&s;enting that they evidently tended to the de&s;truction of tho&s;e powers, to who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance the enemies of his do|ctrine then a&s;cribed them. An argu|ment, which, if duly weighed, renders the objection &s;o very frivolous and ground|le&s;s, that we may venture to call it even bla&s;phemy again&s;t common &s;en&s;e. Would Magic endeavour to draw off the minds of men from the wor&s;hip which was paid to &s;tocks and &s;tones, to give them an abhorrence of tho&s;e evil &s;pirits who re|joiced in the mo&s;t cruel &s;acrifices, and in offerings of the greate&s;t impurity;
<PB N="16" REF="44">
and in &s;hort to call upon mankind to ex|ert their whole &s;trength in the love and adoration of that one Being, from whom they derived their exi&s;tence, and on whom only they were taught to depend every moment for the happine&s;s and con|tinuance of it? Was it the bu&s;ine&s;s of magic to humanize our natures with compa&s;&s;ion, forgivene&s;s, and all the in|&s;tances of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive charity? Would evil &s;pirits contribute to make men &s;ober, cha&s;te, and temperate, and in a word to produce that reformation, which was wrought in the moral world by tho&s;e doctrines of our Saviour, that received their &s;anction from his Miracles? Nor is it po&s;&s;ible to imagine, that evil &s;pirits would enter into a combination with our Saviour to cut off all their cor|re&s;pondence and intercour&s;e with man|kind, and to prevent any for the future from addicting them&s;elves to tho&s;e rites and ceremonies, which had done them &s;o much honour. We &s;ee the early ef|fect which Chri&s;tianity had on the minds of men in this particular, by that num|ber of books, which were filled with the &s;ecrets of magic, and made a &s;acrifice to Chri&s;tianity by the converts mentioned
<PB N="17" REF="45">
in the <HI>Acts</HI> of the Apo&s;tles. We have likewi&s;e an eminent in&s;tance of the incon|&s;i&s;tency of our Religion with magic, in the hi&s;tory of the famous <HI>Aquila.</HI> This per&s;on, who was a kin&s;man of the Em|peror <HI>Trajan,</HI> and likewi&s;e a man of great learning, notwith&s;tanding he had embra|ced Chri&s;tianity, could not be brought off from the &s;tudies of magic, by the re|peated admonitions of his fellow-chri&s;ti|ans: &s;o that at length they expelled him their &s;ociety, as rather chu&s;ing to lo&s;e the reputation of &s;o con&s;iderable a Pro|&s;elyte, than communicate with one who dealt in &s;uch dark and infernal practices. Be&s;ides we may ob&s;erve, that all the fa|vourers of magic were the mo&s;t profe&s;t and bitter enemies to the chri&s;tian reli|gion. Not to mention <HI>Simon Magus</HI> and many others, I &s;hall only take notice of tho&s;e two great per&s;ecutors of chri&s;tiani|ty, the Emperors <HI>Adrian</HI> and <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo&s;tate, both of them initiated in the my&s;teries of divination, and &s;killed in all the depths of magic. I &s;hall only add, that evil &s;pirits cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have concurred in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a religion, which triumphed over them, drove them out of the places they po&s;&s;e&s;t,
<PB N="18" REF="46">
and dive&s;ted them of their influence on mankind; nor would I mention this par|ticular, though it be unanimou&s;ly re|ported by all the ancient chri&s;tian Au|thors; did it not appear from the autho|rities above-cited, that this was a fact confe&s;t by heathens them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="5">V. We now &s;ee what a multitude of <HI>Pagan</HI> te&s;timonies may be produced for all tho&s;e remarkable pa&s;&s;ages, which might have been expected from them: and indeed of &s;everal, that, I believe, do more than an&s;wer your expectation, as they were not &s;ubjects in their own na|ture &s;o expo&s;ed to publick notoriety. It cannot be expected they &s;hould mention particulars, which were tran&s;acted a|mong&s;t the Di&s;ciples only, or among &s;ome few even of the Di&s;ciples them|&s;elves; &s;uch as the tran&s;figuration, the agony in the garden, the appearance of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> after his re&s;urrection, and others of the like nature. It was impo&s;&s;ible for a heathen Author to relate the&s;e things; becau&s;e if he had believed them, he would no longer have been a heathen, and by that means his te&s;timony would not have been thought of &s;o much vali|dity. Be&s;ides, his very report of facts &s;o
<PB N="19" REF="47">
favourable to Chri&s;tianity would have prompted men to &s;ay that he was pro|bably tainted with their doctrine. We have a parallel ca&s;e in <HI>Hecataeus,</HI> a famous <HI>Greek</HI> Hi&s;torian, who had &s;everal pa&s;&s;a|ges in his book conformable to the hi|&s;tory of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> writers, which when quoted by <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> as a confirmation of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> hi&s;tory, when his heathen ad|ver&s;aries could give no other an&s;wer to it, they would need &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Heca|taeus</HI> was a <HI>Jew</HI> in his heart, though they had no other rea&s;on for it, but becau&s;e his hi&s;tory gave greater authority to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> than the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Records.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. TO this li&s;t of heathen writers, who make mention of our Sa|viour, or touch upon any particulars of his life, I &s;hall add tho&s;e Authors who were at fir&s;t Heathens, and afterwards converted to Chri&s;tianity; upon which account, as I &s;hall here &s;hew, their te|&s;timonies are to be looked upon as the more authentick. And in this li&s;t of evi|dences, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to &s;uch learned <HI>Pagans</HI> as came over to Chri&s;ti|anity in the three fir&s;t centuries, becau&s;e tho&s;e were the times in which men had the be&s;t means of informing them&s;elves of the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, and becau&s;e among the great number of phi|lo&s;ophers who came in afterwards, under
<PB N="21" REF="49">
the reigns of chri&s;tian Emperors, there might be &s;everal who did it partly out of worldly motives.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us now &s;uppo&s;e, that a learn|ed heathen writer who lived within &s;ix|ty years of our Saviour's crucifixion, af|ter having &s;hewn that fal&s;e miracles were generally wrought in ob&s;curity, and be|fore few or no witne&s;&s;es, &s;peaking of tho&s;e which were wrought by our Sa|viour, has the following pa&s;&s;age.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">But his works were always &s;een, becau&s;e they were true, they were &s;een by tho&s;e who were healed, and by tho&s;e who were rai&s;ed from the dead. Nay the&s;e per&s;ons who were thus healed, and rai&s;ed, were &s;een not only at the time of their being healed, and rai&s;ed, but long afterwards. Nay they were &s;een not only all the while our Savi|our was upon earth, but &s;urvived af|ter his departure out of this world, nay &s;ome of them were living in our days.</Q></P>
<P N="3">III. I dare &s;ay you would look upon this as a glorious atte&s;tation for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, had it come from the hand of a famous <HI>Athenian</HI> Philo&s;opher. The&s;e forementioned words however are
<PB N="22" REF="50">
actually the words of one who lived about &s;ixty years after our Saviour's crucifixi|on, and was a famous Philo&s;opher in <HI>A|thens:</HI> but it will be &s;aid, he was a con|vert to Chri&s;tianity. Now con&s;ider this matter impartially, and &s;ee if his te&s;ti|mony is not much more valid for that rea&s;on. Had he continued a <HI>Pagan</HI> Phi|lo&s;opher, would not the world have &s;aid that he was not &s;incere in what he writ, or did not believe it; for, if &s;o, would not they have told us he would have em|braced Chri&s;tianity? This was indeed the ca&s;e of this excellent man: he had &s;o thoroughly examined the truth of our Sa|viour's hi&s;tory, and the excellency of that religion which he taught, and was &s;o entirely convinced of both, that he became a Pro&s;elyte, and died a Martyr.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> was an <HI>Athenian</HI> Philo&s;o|pher, at the &s;ame time, famed for his learning and wi&s;dom, but converted to Chri&s;tianity. As it cannot be que&s;tioned that he peru&s;ed and approved the apolo|gy of <HI>Quadratus,</HI> in which is the pa&s;&s;age ju&s;t now cited, he joined with him in an apology of his own, to the &s;ame Em|peror, on the &s;ame &s;ubject. This apolo|gy, tho' now lo&s;t, was extant in the time
<PB N="23" REF="51">
of <HI>Ado Viennen&s;is, A. D.</HI> 870, and highly e&s;teemed by the mo&s;t learned <HI>Athenians,</HI> as that Author witne&s;&s;es. It mu&s;t have contained great arguments for the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, becau&s;e in it he a&s;&s;erted the Divinity of our Saviour&punc; which could not but engage him in the proof of his miracles.</P>
<P N="5">V. I do allow that, generally &s;peak|ing, a man is not &s;o acceptable and un|que&s;tioned an evidence in facts, which make for the advancement of his own party. But we mu&s;t con&s;ider that, in the ca&s;e before us, the per&s;ons, to whom we appeal, were of an oppo&s;ite party, till they were per&s;uaded of the truth of tho&s;e very facts, which they report. They bear evidence to a hi&s;tory in de|fence of Chri&s;tianity, the truth of which hi&s;tory was their motive to embrace Chri&s;tianity, They atte&s;t facts which they had heard while they were yet hea|thens, and had they not found rea&s;on to believe them, they would &s;till have con|tinued heathens, and have made no men|tion of them in their writings.</P>
<P N="6">VI. When a Man is born under chri|&s;tian Parents, and trained up in the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of that religion from a child, he
<PB N="24" REF="52">
generally guides him&s;elf by the rules of <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith</HI> in believing what is deli|vered by the Evangeli&s;ts; but the learned <HI>Pagans</HI> of antiquity, before they became Chri&s;tians, were only guided by the com|mon rules of <HI>Hi&s;torical Faith:</HI> That is, they examined the nature of the evidence which was to be met with in common fame, tradition, and the writings of tho&s;e per&s;ons who related them, together with the number, concurrence, veracity, and private characters of tho&s;e per&s;ons; and being convinced upon all accounts that they had the &s;ame rea&s;on to believe the hi&s;tory of our Saviour, as that of any other per&s;on to which they them&s;elves were not actually eye-witne&s;&s;es, they were bound by all the rules of hi&s;torical faith, and of right rea&s;on, to give credit to this hi&s;tory. This they did accord|ingly, and in con&s;equence of it publi&s;hed the &s;ame truths them&s;elves, &s;uffered ma|ny afflictions, and very often death it&s;elf, in the a&s;&s;ertion of them. When I &s;ay, that an hi&s;torical belief of the acts of our Saviour induced the&s;e learned <HI>Pagans</HI> to embrace his doctrine, I do not deny that there were many other motives, which conduced to it, as the excellency of his
<PB N="25" REF="53">
precepts, the fulfilling of prophecies, the miracles of his Di&s;ciples, the irreproach|able lives and magnanimous &s;ufferings of their followers, with other con&s;idera|tions of the &s;ame nature: but whatever other collateral arguments wrought more or le&s;s with Philo&s;ophers of that age, it is certain that a belief in the hi&s;tory of our Saviour was one motive with every new convert, and that upon which all others turned, as being the very ba&s;is and foundation of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P N="7">VII. To this I mu&s;t further add, that as we have already &s;een many particular facts which are recorded in holy writ, atte&s;ted by particular <HI>Pagan</HI> Authors: the te&s;timony of tho&s;e I am now going to produce, extends to the whole hi&s;to|ry of our Saviour, and to that continued &s;eries of actions, which are related of him and his Di&s;ciples in the books of the <HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. This evidently appears from their quotations out of the Evangeli&s;ts, for the confirmation of any doctrine or account of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. Nay a learned man of our nation, who examin|ed the writings of our mo&s;t ancient Fa|thers in another view, refers to &s;everal
<PB N="26" REF="54">
pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clemens</HI> of <HI>Alexandria, Origen,</HI> and <HI>Cyprian,</HI> by which he plainly &s;hows that each of the&s;e early writers a&s;cribe to the four Evangeli&s;ts by name their re&s;pective hi&s;tories; &s;o that there is not the lea&s;t room for doubting of their belief in the hi&s;tory of our Sa|viour, as recorded in the Go&s;pels. I &s;hall only add, that three of the five Fa|thers here mentioned, and probably four, were <HI>Pagans</HI> converted to Chri&s;tianity, as they were all of them very inqui&s;itive and deep in the knowledge of heathen learning and philo&s;ophy.</P>

<P N="1">I. IT happened very providentially to the honour of the Chri&s;tian reli|gion, that it did not take its ri&s;e in the dark illiterate ages of the world, but at a time when arts and &s;ciences were at their height, and when there were men who made it the bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives to &s;earch after truth, and &s;ift the &s;everal o|pinions of Philo&s;ophers and wi&s;e men, concerning the duty, the end, and chief happine&s;s of rea&s;onable creatures.</P>
<P N="2">II. Several of the&s;e therefore, when they had informed them&s;elves of our Sa|viour's hi&s;tory, and examined with un|prejudiced minds the doctrines and man|ners of his di&s;ciples and followers, were &s;o &s;truck and convinced, that they pro|fe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of that &s;ect; notwith|&s;tanding, by this profe&s;&s;ion in that jun|cture of time, they bid farewel to all the plea&s;ures of this life, renounced all the views of ambition, engaged in an unin|terrupted, cour&s;e of &s;everities, and expo|&s;ed them&s;elves to publick hatred and contempt, to &s;ufferings of all kinds, and to death it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="28" REF="56">III. Of this &s;ort we may reckon tho&s;e three early converts to Chri&s;tianity, who each of them was a member of a Senate famous for its wi&s;dom and learning. <HI>Jo|&s;eph</HI> the <HI>Arimathean</HI> was of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Sanhedrim, Diony&s;ius</HI> of the <HI>Athenian Are|opagus,</HI> and <HI>Flavius Clemens</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Senate; nay at the time of his death Con&s;ul of <HI>Rome.</HI> The&s;e three were &s;o thoroughly &s;atisfied of the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion, that the fir&s;t of them, according to all the reports of antiquity, died a martyr for it; as did the &s;econd, unle&s;s we disbelieve <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> his fellow-citizen and contemporary; and the third, as we are informed both by <HI>Roman</HI> and Chri&s;tian Authors.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Among tho&s;e innumerable multi|tudes, who in mo&s;t of the known nations of the world came over to Chri&s;tianity at its fir&s;t appearance, we may be &s;ure there were great numbers of wi&s;e and learned men, be&s;ide tho&s;e who&s;e Names are in the Chri&s;tian records, who with|out doubt took care to examine the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, before they would leave the religion of their country and of their forefathers, for the &s;ake of one that would not only cut
<PB N="29" REF="57">
them off from the allurements of this world, but &s;ubject them to every thing terrible or di&s;agreeable in it. <HI>Tertullian</HI> tells the <HI>Roman</HI> Governors, that their corporations, councils, armies, tribes, companies, the palace, &s;enate, and courts of judicature were filled with Chri&s;tians; as <HI>Arnobius</HI> a&s;&s;erts, that men of the fine&s;t parts and learning, Orators, Grammarians, Rhetoricians, Lawyers, Phy&s;icians, Phi|lo&s;ophers, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;entiments they had been once fond of, took up their re&s;t in the Chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P N="5">V. Who can imagine that men of this character did not thoroughly inform them&s;elves of the hi&s;tory of that per&s;on, who&s;e doctrines they embraced? for how|ever con&s;onant to rea&s;on his precepts appeared, how good &s;oever were the ef|fects which they produced in the world, nothing could have tempted men to ac|knowledge him as their God and Savi|our, but their being firmly per&s;uaded of the miracles he wrought, and the ma|ny atte&s;tations of his divine mi&s;&s;ion, which were to be met with in the hi&s;to|ry of his life. This was the ground|work of the Chri&s;tian religion, and, if this failed, the whole &s;uper&s;tructure &s;unk
<PB N="30" REF="58">
with it. This point therefore, of the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, as recor|ded by the Evangeli&s;ts, is every where taken for granted in the writings of tho&s;e, who from <HI>Pagan</HI> Philo&s;ophers be|came Chri&s;tian Authors, and who, by rea&s;on of their conver&s;ion, are to be looked upon as of the &s;tronge&s;t collate|ral te&s;timony for the truth of what is delivered concerning our Saviour.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Be&s;ides innumerable Authors that are lo&s;t, we have the undoubted names, works, or fragments of &s;everal <HI>Pagan</HI> Philo&s;ophers, which &s;hew them to have been as learned as any unconverted hea|then Authors of the age in which they lived. If we look into the greate&s;t nur|&s;eries of learning in tho&s;e ages of the world, we find in <HI>Athens, Diony&s;ius, Qua|dratus, Ari&s;tides, Athenagoras</HI>; and in <HI>A|lexandria, Diony&s;ius, Clemens, Ammonius,</HI> and <HI>Anatolius,</HI> to whom we may add <HI>Ori|gen</HI>; for though his father was a Chri|&s;tian martyr, he became, without all controver&s;y, the mo&s;t learned and able Philo&s;opher of his age, by his education at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in that famous &s;eminary of arts and &s;ciences.</P>

<P N="2">II. As to this point, we mu&s;t con&s;i|der, that many thou&s;ands had &s;een the tran&s;actions of our Saviour in <HI>Judaea,</HI> and that many hundred thou&s;ands had receiv|ed an account of them from the mouths of tho&s;e who were actually eye-witne&s;&s;es.

other di&s;ciples and followers of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had al&s;o their &s;hare in the publi&s;h|ing this wonderful hi&s;tory.

of Morality, which they taught as delivered to them from our Saviour, averring that they had &s;een his miracles during his life, and conver&s;ed with him after his death; when, I &s;ay, they &s;aw no &s;u&s;picion of fal&s;hood, treachery, or worldly intere&s;t, in their behaviour and conver&s;ation, and that they &s;ubmitted to the mo&s;t ignominious and cruel deaths, rather than retract their te&s;timony, or even be &s;ilent in matters which they were to publi&s;h by their Saviour's e&s;pe|cial command, there was no rea&s;on to doubt of the veracity of tho&s;e facts which they related, or of the Divine Mi&s;&s;ion in which they were employed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. But even the&s;e motives to Faith in our Saviour would not have been &s;uf|ficient to have brought about in &s;o few years &s;uch an incredible number of con|ver&s;ions, had not the Apo&s;tles been able to exhibit &s;till greater proofs of the truths which they taught. A few per|&s;ons of an odious and de&s;pi&s;ed country could not have filled the world with Be|lievers, had they not &s;hown undoubted credentials from the Divine per&s;on who &s;ent them on &s;uch a me&s;&s;age. According|ly we are a&s;&s;ured, that they were inve|&s;ted
<PB N="35" REF="63">
with the power of working mira|cles, which was the mo&s;t &s;hort and the mo&s;t convincing argument that could be produced, and the only one that was adapted to the rea&s;on of all mankind, to the capacities of the wi&s;e and ignorant, and could overcome every cavil and eve|ry prejudice. Who would not believe that our Saviour healed the &s;ick, and rai&s;ed the dead, when it was publi&s;hed by tho&s;e who them&s;elves often did the &s;ame miracles, in their pre&s;ence, and in his name! Could any rea&s;onable per&s;on imagine, that God Almighty would arm men with &s;uch powers to authorize a lye, and e&s;tabli&s;h a religion in the world which was di&s;plea&s;ing to him, or that evil &s;pirits would lend them &s;uch an ef|fectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance to beat down vice and idolatry?</P>
<P N="5">V. When the Apo&s;tles had formed many a&s;&s;emblies in &s;everal parts of the <HI>Pagan</HI> world, who gave credit to the glad tidings of the Go&s;pel, that, upon their departure, the memory of what they had related might not peri&s;h, they ap|pointed out of the&s;e new converts, men of the be&s;t &s;en&s;e, and of the mo&s;t unble|mi&s;hed lives, to pre&s;ide over the&s;e &s;eve|ral
<PB N="36" REF="64">
a&s;&s;emblies, and to inculcate without cea&s;ing what they had heard from the mouths of the&s;e eye-witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Upon the death of any of tho&s;e &s;ub&s;titutes to the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> his place was filled up with &s;ome other per&s;on of eminence for his piety and learning, and generally a mem|ber of the &s;ame Church, who after his decea&s;e was followed by another in the &s;ame manner, by which means the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion was continued in an uninterrupt|ed line. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> informs us, that every church pre&s;erved a catalogue of its Bi|&s;hops in the order that they &s;ucceeded one another, and (for an example) produces the catalogue of tho&s;e who governed the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in that character, which contains eight or nine per&s;ons, though but at a very &s;mall remove from the times of the Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>Indeed the li&s;ts of Bi&s;hops, which are come down to us in other churches, are generally filled with greater numbers than one would expect. But the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was quick in the three fir&s;t centuries, be|cau&s;e the Bi&s;hop very often ended in the Martyr: for when a per&s;ecution aro&s;e in any place, the fir&s;t fury of it fell upon
<PB N="37" REF="65">
this Order of holy men, who abundant|ly te&s;tified by their Deaths and Suffer|ings that they did not undertake the&s;e offices out of any temporal views, that they were &s;incere and &s;atisfied in the be|lief of what they taught, and that they firmly adhered to what they had received from the Apo&s;tles, as laying down their lives in the &s;ame hope, and upon the &s;ame principles. None can be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o utterly regardle&s;s of their own happi|ne&s;s as to expire in torment, and hazard their Eternity, to &s;upport any fables and inventions of their own, or any forgeries of their predece&s;&s;ors who had pre&s;ided in the &s;ame church, and which might have been ea&s;ily detected by the tradition of that particular church, as well as by the concurring te&s;timony of others. To this purpo&s;e, I think it is very remarkable, that there was not a &s;ingle Martyr among tho&s;e many Hereticks, who di&s;agreed with the Apo&s;tolical church, and intro|duced &s;everal wild and ab&s;urd notions into the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity. They dur&s;t not &s;take their pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s on their own chimerical ope|rations, and did not only &s;hun per&s;ecu|tion, but affirmed that it was unnece&s;&s;a|ry
<PB N="38" REF="66">
for their followers to bear their reli|gion through &s;uch fiery tryals.</P>
<P N="7">VII. We may fairly reckon, that this fir&s;t age of Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples, with that &s;econd generation of many who were their immediate converts, extended it &s;elf to the middle of the &s;econd Cen|tury, and that &s;everal of the third gene|ration from the&s;e la&s;t mentioned, which was but the fifth from <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> continued to the end of the third Century. Did we know the ages and numbers of the members in every particular church, which was planted by the Apo&s;tles, I doubt not but in mo&s;t of them there might be found five per&s;ons who in a continued &s;eries would reach through the&s;e three centuries of years, that is till the 265th from the death of our Sa|viour.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Among the accounts of tho&s;e very few out of innumerable multitudes, who had embraced Chri&s;tianity, I &s;hall &s;ingle out four per&s;ons eminent for their lives, their writings, and their &s;ufferings, that were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively contemporaries, and bring us down as far as to the year of our Lord 254. St. <HI>John,</HI> who was the beloved Di&s;ciple, and conver&s;ed the
<PB N="39" REF="67">
mo&s;t intimately with our Saviour, lived till <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 100. <HI>Polycarp,</HI> who was the Di&s;ciple of St. <HI>John,</HI> and had con|ver&s;ed with others of the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples of our Lord, lived till <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 167, though his life was &s;hortened by martyrdom. <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> who was the Di&s;ciple of <HI>Polycarp,</HI> and had conver&s;ed with many of the immediate Di&s;ciples of the Apo&s;tles, lived, at the lowe&s;t com|putation of his age, till the year 202, when he was likewi&s;e cut off by martyr|dom; in which year the great <HI>Origen</HI> was appointed Regent of the Catechetick &s;chool in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and as he was the miracle of that age, for indu&s;try, learn|ing, and philo&s;ophy, he was looked upon as the champion of Chri&s;tianity, till the year 254, when, if he did not &s;uffer martyrdom, as &s;ome think he did, he was certainly actuated by the &s;pirit of it, as appears in the whole cour&s;e of his life and writings; nay, he had often been put to the torture, and had undergone tryals wor&s;e than death. As he conver|&s;ed with the mo&s;t eminent Chri&s;tians of his time in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and in the Ea&s;t, brought over multitudes both from here&s;y and heatheni&s;m, and left behind him &s;everal
<PB N="40" REF="68">
Di&s;ciples of great fame and learning, there is no que&s;tion but there were con|&s;iderable numbers of tho&s;e who knew him, and had been his hearers, &s;cholars, or pro&s;elytes, that lived till the end of the third century, and to the reign of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great.</P>
<P N="9">IX. It is evident to tho&s;e, who read the lives and writings of <HI>Polycarp, Ire|naeus,</HI> and <HI>Origen,</HI> that the&s;e three Fathers believed the accounts which are given of our Saviour in the four Evangeli&s;ts, and had undoubted arguments that not only St. <HI>John,</HI> but many others of our Sa|viour's di&s;ciples, publi&s;hed the &s;ame ac|counts of him. To which we mu&s;t &s;ub|join this further remark, that what was believed by the&s;e Fathers on this &s;ubject, was likewi&s;e the belief of the main body of Chri&s;tians in tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages when they flouri&s;hed; &s;ince <HI>Polycarp</HI> cannot but be looked upon, if we con&s;ider the re|&s;pect that was paid him, as the repre&s;en|tative of the Ea&s;tern Churches in this particular, <HI>Irenaeus</HI> of the We&s;tern upon the &s;ame account, and <HI>Origen</HI> of tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. To the&s;e I might add <HI>Paul</HI> the fa|mous hermite, who retired from the <HI>De|cian</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="69">
per&s;ecution five or &s;ix years before <HI>Origen</HI>'s death, and lived till the year 343. I have only di&s;covered one of tho&s;e chan|nels by which the hi&s;tory of our Saviour might be conveyed pure and unadultera|ted, through tho&s;e &s;everal ages that pro|duced tho&s;e <HI>Pagan</HI> Philo&s;ophers, who&s;e te&s;timonies I make u&s;e of for the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory. Some or other of the&s;e Philo&s;ophers came into the Chri|&s;tian faith during its infancy, in the &s;e|veral periods of the&s;e three fir&s;t centu|ries, when they had &s;uch means of in|forming them&s;elves in all the particulars of our Saviour's hi&s;tory. I mu&s;t further add, that though I have here only cho|&s;en this &s;ingle link of martyrs, I might find out others among tho&s;e names which are &s;till extant, that delivered down this account of our Saviour in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive tra|dition, till the whole <HI>Roman</HI> empire be|came Chri&s;tian; as there is no que&s;tion but numberle&s;s &s;eries of witne&s;&s;es might follow one another in the &s;ame order, and in as &s;hort a chain, and that perhaps in every &s;ingle Church, had the names and ages of the mo&s;t eminent primitive Chri&s;tians been tran&s;mitted to us with the like certainty.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="42" REF="70">XI. But to give this con&s;ideration more force, we mu&s;t take notice, that the tradition of the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;ti|anity had &s;everal circum&s;tances peculiar to it, which made it more authentick than any other tradition in any other age of the world. The Chri&s;tians, who carried their religion through &s;o ma|ny general and particular per&s;ecutions, were ince&s;&s;antly comforting and &s;up|porting one another, with the exam|ple and hi&s;tory of our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles. It was the &s;ubject not only of their &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies, but of their pri|vate vi&s;its and conver&s;ations. <HI>Our vir|gins,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Tatian,</HI> who lived in the &s;econd century, <HI>di&s;cour&s;e over their di&s;taffs on di|vine &s;ubjects.</HI> Indeed, when religion was woven into the civil government, and flouri&s;hed under the protection of the Emperors, men's thoughts and di&s;cour|&s;es were, as they are now, full of &s;ecu|lar affairs; but in the three fir&s;t centu|ries of Chri&s;tianity, men, who embraced this religion, had given up all their in|tere&s;ts in this world, and lived in a per|petual preparation for the next, as not knowing how &s;oon they might be called to it: &s;o that they had little el&s;e to talk
<PB N="43" REF="71">
of but the life and doctrines of that di|vine per&s;on, which was their hope, their encouragement, and their glory. We cannot therefore imagine, that there was a &s;ingle per&s;on arrived at any degree of age or con&s;ideration, who had not heard and repeated above a thou&s;and times in his life, all the particulars of our Sa|viour's birth, life, death, re&s;urrection, and a&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P N="12">XII. E&s;pecially if we con&s;ider, that they could not then be received as Chri|&s;tians, till they had undergone &s;everal ex|aminations. Per&s;ons of riper years, who flocked daily into the Church during the three fir&s;t centuries, were obliged to pa&s;s through many repeated in&s;tructions, and give a &s;trict account of their proficien|cy, before they were admitted to Bap|ti&s;m. And as for tho&s;e who were born of Chri&s;tian parents, and had been bap|ti&s;ed in their infancy, they were with the like care prepared and di&s;ciplined for confirmation, which they could not ar|rive at, till they were found upon exa|mination to have made a &s;ufficient pro|gre&s;s in the knowledge of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. We mu&s;t further ob&s;erve, that there was not only in tho&s;e times this re|ligious
<PB N="44" REF="72">
conver&s;ation among private Chri|&s;tians, but a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence be|tween the Churches that were e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by the Apo&s;tles or their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in the &s;everal parts of the world. If any new doctrine was &s;tarted, or any fact re|ported of our Saviour, a &s;trict enquiry was made among the Churches, e&s;peci|ally tho&s;e planted by the Apo&s;tles them|&s;elves, whether they had received any &s;uch doctrine or account of our Saviour, from the mouths of the Apo&s;tles, or the tradition of tho&s;e Chri&s;tians, who had preceded the pre&s;ent members of the Churches which were thus con&s;ulted. By this means, when any novelty was published, it was immediately detected and cen&s;ured.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. St. <HI>John,</HI> who lived &s;o many years after our Saviour, was appealed to in the&s;e emergencies as the living Ora|cle of the Church; and as his oral te&s;ti|mony la&s;ted the fir&s;t century, many have ob&s;erved that, by a particular providence of God, &s;everal of our Saviour's Di&s;ci|ples, and of the early converts of his re|ligion, lived to a very great age, that they might per&s;onally convey the truth of the Go&s;pel to tho&s;e times, which were
<PB N="45" REF="73">
very remote from the fir&s;t publication of it. Of the&s;e, be&s;ides St. <HI>John,</HI> we have a remarkable in&s;tance in <HI>Simeon,</HI> who was one of the Seventy &s;ent forth by our Saviour, to publi&s;h the Go&s;pel before his crucifixion, and a near kin&s;|man of the Lord. This venerable per|&s;on, who had probably heard with his own ears our Saviour's prophecy of the de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> pre&s;ided over the Church e&s;tabli&s;hed in that city, du|ring the time of its memorable &s;iege, and drew his congregation out of tho&s;e dreadful and unparallel'd calamities which befel his countrymen, by following the advice our Saviour had given, when they &s;hould &s;ee <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> encompa&s;&s;ed with armies, and the <HI>Roman</HI> &s;tandards, or abo|mination of de&s;olation, &s;et up.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THUS far we &s;ee how the learned <HI>Pagans</HI> might apprize them&s;elves from oral information of the particulars
<PB N="47" REF="75">
of our Saviour's hi&s;tory. They could hear, in every Church planted in every di&s;tant part of the earth, the account which was there received and pre&s;erved among them, of the hi&s;tory of our Sa|viour. They could learn the names and characters of tho&s;e fir&s;t mi&s;&s;ionaries that brought to them the&s;e accounts, and the miracles by which God Almighty atte|&s;ted their reports. But the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to pre&s;erve the hi&s;to|ry of his life, and to &s;ecure their ac|counts of him from error and oblivion, did not only &s;et a&s;ide certain per&s;ons for that purpo&s;e, as has been already &s;hewn, but appropriated certain days to the commemoration of tho&s;e facts which they had related concerning him. The fir&s;t day of the week was in all its returns a perpetual memorial of his re&s;urrection, as the devotional exerci&s;es adapted to <HI>Fri|day</HI> and <HI>Saturday,</HI> were to denote to all ages that he was crucified on the one of tho&s;e days, and that he re&s;ted in the grave on the other. You may apply the &s;ame re|mark to &s;everal of the annual fe&s;tivals in&s;tituted by the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, or at furthe&s;t by their immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in memory of the mo&s;t important parti|culars
<PB N="48" REF="76">
in our Saviour's hi&s;tory; to which we mu&s;t add the Sacraments in&s;tituted by our Lord him&s;elf, and many of tho&s;e rites and ceremonies which obtained in the mo&s;t early times of the Church. The&s;e are to be regarded as &s;tanding marks of &s;uch facts as were delivered by tho&s;e, who were eye-witne&s;&s;es to them, and which were contrived with great wi&s;dom to la&s;t till time &s;hould be no more. The&s;e, without any other means, might have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, conveyed to po&s;terity, the memory of &s;everal tran&s;actions in the hi&s;tory of our Saviour, as they were re|lated by his Di&s;ciples. At lea&s;t, the rea|&s;on of the&s;e in&s;titutions, though they might be forgotten, and ob&s;cured by a long cour&s;e of years, could not but be very well known by tho&s;e who lived in the three fir&s;t centuries, and a means of informing the inqui&s;itive <HI>Pagans</HI> in the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, that be|ing the view in which I am to con&s;ider them.</P>
<P N="2">II. But le&s;t &s;uch a tradition, though guarded by &s;o many expedients, &s;hould wear out by the length of time, the four Evangeli&s;ts within about fifty, or, as <HI>Theodoret</HI> affirms, thirty years, after our
<PB N="49" REF="77">
Saviour's death, while the memory of his actions was fre&s;h among them, con&s;igned to writing that hi&s;tory, which for &s;ome years had been publi&s;hed only by the mouths of the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples. The further con&s;ideration of the&s;e holy penmen will fall under another part of this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">III. It will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve here, that in the age which &s;ucceeded the Apo&s;tles, many of their immediate Di&s;ciples &s;ent or carried in per&s;on the books of the four Evangeli&s;ts, which had been written by Apo&s;tles, or at lea&s;t ap|proved by them, to mo&s;t of the Churches which they had planted in the different parts of the world. This was done with &s;o much diligence, that when <HI>Pantaenus,</HI> a man of great learning and piety, had travelled into <HI>India</HI> for the propagation of Chri&s;tianity, about the year of our Lord 200, he found among that remote peo|ple the Go&s;pel of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> which upon his return from that country he brought with him to <HI>Alexandria.</HI> This Go&s;pel is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been left in tho&s;e parts by St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> the Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Indies,</HI> who probably car|ried it with him before the writings
<PB N="50" REF="78">
of the three other Evangeli&s;ts were pub|li&s;h'd.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the hi&s;tory of our Saviour, as recorded by the Evangeli&s;ts, was the &s;ame with that which had been before delivered by the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples, will further appear in the pro&s;ecution of this di&s;cour&s;e, and may be gathered from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="5">V. Had the&s;e writings differed from the &s;ermons of the fir&s;t planters of Chri|&s;tianity, either in hi&s;tory or doctrine, there is no que&s;tion but they would have been rejected by tho&s;e Churches which they had already formed. But &s;o con&s;i|&s;tent and uniform was the relation of the Apo&s;tles, that the&s;e hi&s;tories appeared to be nothing el&s;e but their tradition and oral atte&s;tations made fixt and perma|nent. Thus was the fame of our Saviour, which in &s;o few years had gone through the whole earth, confirmed and perpe|tuated by &s;uch records, as would pre&s;erve the traditionary account of him to after|ages; and rectify it, if at any time, by pa&s;&s;ing through &s;everal generations, it might drop any part that was material, or contract any thing that was fal&s;e or fictitious.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="51" REF="79">VI. Accordingly we find the &s;ame <HI>Je|&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who was born of a Virgin, who had wrought many miracles in <HI>Pa|le&s;tine,</HI> who was crucified, ro&s;e again, and a&s;cended into Heaven; I &s;ay, the &s;ame <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> had been preached, and was wor&s;hipped, in <HI>Germany, France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in <HI>Parthia, Media, Me&s;opotamia, Armenia, Phrygia, A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Pamphilia,</HI> in <HI>Italy, Egypt, Afric,</HI> and beyond <HI>Cyrene, India</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and, in &s;hort, in all the i&s;lands and provinces that are vi&s;ited by the ri&s;ing or &s;etting &s;un. The &s;ame account of our Saviour's life and doctrine was delivered by thou|&s;ands of Preachers, and believed in thou|&s;ands of places, who all, as fa&s;t as it could be conveyed to them, received the &s;ame ac|count in writing from the four Evangeli&s;ts.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> to this purpo&s;e very apt|ly remarks, that tho&s;e barbarous nations, who in his time were not po&s;&s;e&s;t of the written go&s;pels, and had only learned the hi&s;tory of our Saviour from tho&s;e who had converted them to Chri&s;tianity before the Go&s;pels were written, had a|mong them the &s;ame accounts of our Sa|viour, which are to be met with in the four Evangeli&s;ts. An unconte&s;table proof
<PB N="52" REF="80">
of the harmony and concurrence between the holy &s;cripture and the tradition of the Churches in tho&s;e early times of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Thus we &s;ee what opportuni|ties the learned and inqui&s;itive heathens had of informing them&s;elves of the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, during the three fir&s;t Centuries, e&s;pecially as they lay near|er one than another to the fountain|head: be&s;ide which, there were many un|controverted traditions, records of Chri|&s;tianity, and particular hi&s;tories, that then threw light into the&s;e matters, but are now entirely lo&s;t, by which, at that time, any appearance of contradiction, or &s;eeming difficulties, in the hi&s;tory of the Evangeli&s;ts, were fully cleared up and explained: though we meet with fewer appearances of this nature in the hi&s;tory of our Saviour, as related by the four Evangeli&s;ts, than in the accounts of any other per&s;on, publi&s;hed by &s;uch a number of different hi&s;torians who lived at &s;o great a di&s;tance from the pre&s;ent age.</P>

<P N="1"><PB N="54" REF="82">I. THERE were other means, which I find had a great influence on the learned of the three fir&s;t Centuries, to create and confirm in them the belief of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's hi&s;tory, which ought not to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. The fir&s;t was, the opportunity they enjoyed of examining tho&s;e miracles, which were on &s;everal occa&s;ions performed by Chri|&s;tians, and appeared in the Church, more or le&s;s, during the&s;e fir&s;t ages of Chri|&s;tianity. The&s;e had great weight with the men I am now &s;peaking of, who, from learned <HI>Pagans,</HI> became fathers of the Church; for they frequently boa&s;t of them in their writings, as atte&s;tations given by God him&s;elf to the truth of their religion.</P>
<P N="2">II. At the &s;ame time, that the&s;e learn|ed men declare how di&s;ingenuous, ba&s;e and wicked it would be, how much be|neath the dignity of Philo&s;ophy, and con|trary to the precepts of Chri&s;tianity, to utter fal&s;hoods or forgeries in the &s;up|port of a cau&s;e, though never &s;o ju&s;t in it &s;elf, they confidently a&s;&s;ert this mira|culous power, which then &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the Church, nay tell us that they them|&s;elves
<PB N="55" REF="83">
had been eye-witne&s;&s;es of it at &s;e|veral times, and in &s;everal in&s;tances; nay appeal to the heathens them&s;elves for the truth of &s;everal facts they re|late, nay challenge them to be pre&s;ent at their a&s;&s;emblies, and &s;atisfy them|&s;elves, if they doubt of it; nay we find that <HI>Pagan</HI> Authors have in &s;ome in&s;tan|ces confe&s;&s;ed this miraculous power.</P>
<P N="3">III. The letter of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> who&s;e army was pre&s;erved by a refre&s;h|ing &s;hower, at the &s;ame time that his enemies were di&s;comfited by a &s;torm of lightning, and which the heathen hi&s;to|rians them&s;elves allow to have been &s;u|pernatural and the effect of magic: I &s;ay, this letter, which a&s;cribed this unexpe|cted a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the prayers of the Chri|&s;tians, who then &s;erved in the army, would have been thought an unque&s;tion|able te&s;timony of the miraculous power I am &s;peaking of, had it been &s;till pre|&s;erved. It is &s;ufficient for me in this place to take notice, that this was one of tho&s;e miracles which had its influence on the learned Converts, becau&s;e it is related by <HI>Tertullian,</HI> and the very letter appealed to. When the&s;e learned men &s;aw &s;ickne&s;s and frenzy cured, the dead rai&s;ed, the ora|cles
<PB N="56" REF="84">
put to &s;ilence, the <HI>Daemons</HI> and evil &s;pirits forced to confe&s;s them&s;elves no Gods, by per&s;ons who only made u&s;e of prayer and adjurations in the name of their crucified Saviour; how could they doubt of their Saviour's power on the like occa&s;ions, as repre&s;ented to them by the traditions of the Church, and the writings of the Evangeli&s;ts?</P>
<P N="4">IV. Under this head, I cannot omit that which appears to me a &s;tanding mi|racle in the three fir&s;t Centuries, I mean that amazing and &s;upernatural courage or patience, which was &s;hewn by innu|merable multitudes of Martyrs, in tho&s;e &s;low and painful torments that were in|flicted on them. I cannot conceive a man placed in the burning iron chair at <HI>Lyons,</HI> amid the in&s;ults and mockeries of a crouded Amphitheatre, and &s;till keeping his &s;eat; or &s;tretched upon a grate of iron, over coals of fire, and breathing out his &s;oul among the exqui|&s;ite &s;ufferings of &s;uch a tedious execu|tion, rather than renounce his religion, or bla&s;pheme his Saviour. Such tryals &s;eem to me above the &s;trength of human nature, and able to over-bear duty, rea|&s;on, faith, conviction, nay, and the mo&s;t
<PB N="57" REF="85">
ab&s;olute certainty of a future &s;tate. Hu|manity, una&s;&s;i&s;ted in an extraordinary manner, mu&s;t have &s;haken off the pre|&s;ent pre&s;&s;ure, and have delivered it &s;elf out of &s;uch a dreadful di&s;tre&s;s, by any means that could have been &s;ugge&s;ted to it. We can ea&s;ily imagine, that many per&s;ons, in &s;o good a cau&s;e, might have laid down their lives at the gibbet, the &s;take, or the block: but to expire lei|&s;urely among the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tortures, when they might come out of them, even by a mental re&s;ervation, or an hy|pocri&s;y which was not without a po&s;&s;ibi|lity of being followed by repentance and forgivene&s;s, has &s;omething in it, &s;o far beyond the force and natural &s;trength of mortals, that one cannot but think there was &s;ome miraculous power to &s;upport the &s;ufferer.</P>
<P N="5">V. We find the Church of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> in that admirable letter which gives an ac|count of the death of <HI>Polycarp</HI> their be|loved Bi&s;hop, mentioning the cruel tor|ments of other early Martyrs for Chri&s;ti|anity, are of opinion, that our Saviour &s;tood by them in a vi&s;ion, and per&s;onal|ly conver&s;ed with them, to give them &s;trength and comfort during the bitter|ne&s;s
<PB N="58" REF="86">
of their long-continued agonies; and we have the &s;tory of a young man, who, having &s;uffered many tortures, e&s;ca|ped with life, and told his fellow-chri|&s;tians, that the pain of them had been rendred tolerable, by the pre&s;ence of an Angel who &s;tood by him, and wiped off the tears and &s;weat, which ran down his face whil&s;t he lay under his &s;ufferings. We are a&s;&s;ured at lea&s;t that the fir&s;t Martyr for Chri&s;tianity was encouraged in his la&s;t moments, by a vi&s;ion of that divine per&s;on, for whom he &s;uffered, and into who&s;e pre&s;ence he was then ha&s;ten|ing.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Let any man calmly lay his hand upon his heart, and after reading the&s;e terrible conflicts in which the ancient Martyrs and Confe&s;&s;ors were engaged, when they pa&s;&s;ed through &s;uch new in|ventions and varieties of pain, as tired their tormentors; and ask him&s;elf, however zealous and &s;incere he is in his religion, whether under &s;uch acute and lingring tortures he could &s;till have held fa&s;t his integrity, and have profe&s;&s;ed his faith to the la&s;t, without a &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome kind or other. For my part, when I con&s;ider that it was not an unac|countable
<PB N="59" REF="87">
ob&s;tinacy in a &s;ingle man, or in any particular &s;ett of men, in &s;ome ex|traordinary juncture; but that there were multitudes of each &s;ex, of every age, of different countries and conditions, who for near 300 years together made this glorious confe&s;&s;ion of their faith, in the mid&s;t of tortures, and in the hour of death&punc; I mu&s;t conclude, that they were either of another make than men are at pre&s;ent, or that they had &s;uch miracu|lous &s;upports as were peculiar to tho&s;e times of Chri&s;tianity, when without them perhaps the very name of it might have been extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P N="7">VII. It is certain, that the deaths and &s;ufferings of the primitive Chri&s;tians had a great &s;hare in the conver&s;ion of tho&s;e learned <HI>Pagans,</HI> who lived in the ages of Per&s;ecution, which with &s;ome intervals and abatements la&s;ted near 300 years af|ter our Saviour. <HI>Justin Martyr, Tertul|lian, Lactantius, Arnobius,</HI> and others, tell us, that this fir&s;t of all alarmed their cu|rio&s;ity, rou&s;ed their attention, and made them &s;eriou&s;ly inqui&s;itive into the nature of that religion, which could endue the mind with &s;o much &s;trength and over|come the fear of death, nay rai&s;e an ear|ne&s;t
<PB N="60" REF="88">
de&s;ire of it, though it appeared in all its terrors. This they found had not been effected by all the doctrines of tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers, whom they had thorough|ly &s;tudied, and who had been labouring at this great point. The &s;ight of the&s;e dying and tormented Martyrs engaged them to &s;earch into the hi&s;tory and do|ctrines of him for whom they &s;uffered. The more they &s;earched, the more they were convinced; till their conviction grew &s;o &s;trong, that they them&s;elves embraced the &s;ame truths, and either actually laid down their lives, or were always in a readine&s;s to do it, rather than depart from them.</P>

<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> The&s;e arguments &s;trengthened by what has happened &s;ince <HI>Origen</HI>'s time.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THE &s;econd of tho&s;e extraordinary means, of great u&s;e to the learn|ed and inqui&s;itive <HI>Pagans</HI> of the three fir&s;t Centuries, for evincing the truth of the hi&s;tory of our Saviour, was the com|pletion of &s;uch prophecies as are record|ed of him in the Evangeli&s;ts. They could not indeed form any arguments from what he foretold, and was fulfilled du|ring his life, becau&s;e both the prophecy and the completion were over before they were publi&s;hed by the Evangeli&s;ts; though, as <HI>Origen</HI> ob&s;erves, what end could there be in forging &s;ome of the&s;e predictions, as that of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s deny|ing his ma&s;ter, and all his Di&s;ciples for|&s;aking him in the greate&s;t extremity, which reflects &s;o much &s;hame on the great Apo&s;tle, and on all his companions? Nothing but a &s;trict adherence to truth,
<PB N="62" REF="90">
and to matters of fact, could have prompted the Evangeli&s;ts to relate a cir|cum&s;tance &s;o di&s;advantageous to their own reputation; as that Father has well ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="2">II. But to pur&s;ue his reflections on this &s;ubject. There are predictions of our Sa|viour recorded by the Evangeli&s;ts, which were not completed till after their deaths, and had no likelihood of being &s;o, when they were pronounced by our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour. Such was that wonderful notice he gave them, that they &s;hould be brought before Governors and Kings for his &s;ake, for a te&s;timony again&s;t them and the <HI>Gen|tiles, Mat.</HI> x.28. with the other like prophecies, by which he foretold that his Di&s;ciples were to be per&s;ecuted. Is there any other doctrine in the world, &s;ays this Father, who&s;e followers are puni&s;hed? Can the enemies of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ay, that he knew his opinions were fal&s;e and impious, and that therefore he might well conjecture and foretel what would be the treatment of tho&s;e per&s;ons who &s;hould embrace them? Suppo&s;ing his do|ctrines were really &s;uch, why &s;hould this be the con&s;equence? what likelihood that men &s;hould be brought before Kings
<PB N="63" REF="91">
and Governors for opinions and tenets of any kind, when this never happened even to the <HI>Epicureans,</HI> who ab&s;olutely denied a Providence; nor to the <HI>Peri|pateticks</HI> them&s;elves, who laughed at the prayers and &s;acrifices which were made to the Divinity? Are there any but the Chri&s;tians who, according to this pre|diction of our Saviour, being brought before Kings and Governors for his &s;ake, are pre&s;&s;ed to their late&s;t ga&s;p of breath, by their re&s;pective judges, to renounce Chri&s;tianity, and to procure their liber|ty and re&s;t, by offering the &s;ame &s;acri|fices, and taking the &s;ame oaths that o|thers did?</P>
<P N="3">III Con&s;ider the time when our Sa|viour pronounced tho&s;e words, Mat. x. 32. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall confe&s;s me before men, him will I confe&s;s al&s;o before my Father which is in heaven: but who&s;oever &s;hall de|ny me before men, him will I al&s;o deny be|fore my Father which is in heaven.</HI> Had you heard him &s;peak after this manner, when as yet his Di&s;ciples were under no &s;uch tryals, you would certainly have &s;aid within your &s;elf, If the&s;e &s;peeches of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> are true, and if, according to his prediction, Governors and Kings un|dertake
<PB N="64" REF="92">
to ruin and de&s;troy tho&s;e who &s;hall profe&s;s them&s;elves his Di&s;ciples, we will believe (not only that he is a Pro|phet) but that he has received power from God &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve and pro|pagate his religion; and that he would never talk in &s;uch a peremptory and di&s;|couraging manner, were he not a&s;&s;ured that he was able to &s;ubdue the mo&s;t pow|erful oppo&s;ition, that could be made a|gain&s;t the faith and doctrine which he taught.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Who is not &s;truck with admira|tion, when he repre&s;ents to him&s;elf our Saviour at that time foretelling, that his Go&s;pel &s;hould be preached in all the world, for a witne&s;s unto all nations, or as <HI>Origen</HI> (who rather quotes the &s;en&s;e than the words) to &s;erve for a convi|ction to Kings and people, when at the &s;ame time he finds that his Go&s;pel has accordingly been preached to <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Barbarians,</HI> to the learned and to the ig|norant, and that there is no quality or condition of life able to exempt men from &s;ubmitting to the doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> As for us, &s;ays this great Author, in an|other part of his book again&s;t <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">When we &s;ee every day tho&s;e events
<PB N="65" REF="93">
exactly accompli&s;hed which our Sa|viour foretold at &s;o great a di&s;tance: That his Go&s;pel is preached in all the world, <HI>Mat.</HI> xxiv.14. That his Di&s;ci|ples go and teach all nations, <HI>Mat.</HI> xxviii.19. And that tho&s;e, who have received his doctrine, are brought for his &s;ake before Governors, and before Kings, <HI>Mat.</HI> x.18. we are filled with admiration, and our faith in him is confirmed more and more. What clearer and &s;tronger proofs can <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> ask for the truth of what he &s;poke?</Q></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Origen</HI> in&s;i&s;ts likewi&s;e with great &s;trength on that wonderful prediction of our Saviour, concerning the de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> pronounced at a time, as he ob&s;erves, when there was no likeli|hood nor appearance of it. This has been taken notice of and inculcated by &s;o many others, that I &s;hall refer you to what this Father has &s;aid on the &s;ubject in the fir&s;t book again&s;t <HI>Cel&s;us.</HI> And as to the accompli&s;hment of this remark|able prophecy, &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that whoever reads the account given us by <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> without knowing his character, and compares it with what our Saviour foretold, would think the hi&s;torian had
<PB N="66" REF="94">
been a Chri&s;tian, and that he had no|thing el&s;e in view but to adju&s;t the event to the prediction.</P>
<P N="6">VI. I cannot quit this head without taking notice, that <HI>Origen</HI> would &s;till have triumphed more in the foregoing argu|ments, had he lived an age longer, to have &s;een the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, and all their Governors and provinces, &s;ubmit|ting them&s;elves to the Chri&s;tian religion, and glorying in its profe&s;&s;ion, as &s;o ma|ny Kings and Soveraigns &s;till place their relation to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> at the head of their titles.</P>
<P>How much greater confirmation of his faith would he have received, had he &s;een our Saviour's prophecy &s;tand good in the de&s;truction of the temple, and the di&s;&s;olution of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> oecono|my, when <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Pagans</HI> united all their endeavours under <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo|&s;tate, to baffle and fal&s;ify the prediction? The great preparations that were made for re-building the temple, with the hur|ricane, earthquake, and eruptions of fire, that de&s;troyed the work, and terrified tho&s;e employed in the attempt from pro|ceeding in it, are related by many hi&s;to|rians of the &s;ame age, and the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;tory te&s;tified both by <HI>Pagan</HI> and
<PB N="67" REF="95">
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> writers, as <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> and <HI>Zemath-David.</HI> The learned <HI>Chry|&s;o&s;tome,</HI> in a &s;ermon again&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> tells them this fact was then fre&s;h in the memories even of their young men, that it happened but twenty years ago, and that it was atte&s;ted by all the inhabitants of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> where they might &s;till &s;ee the marks of it in the rubbi&s;h of that work, from which the <HI>Jews</HI> de&s;i&s;ted in &s;o great a fright, and which even <HI>Julian</HI> had not the courage to carry on. This fact, which is in it &s;elf &s;o miraculous, and &s;o indi&s;putable, brought over many of the <HI>Jews</HI> to Chri&s;tianity; and &s;hows us, that after our Saviour's prophecy a|gain&s;t it, the temple could not be pre|&s;erved from the plough pa&s;&s;ing over it, by all the care of <HI>Titus,</HI> who would fain have prevented its de&s;truction, and that in&s;tead of being re-edified by <HI>Julian,</HI> all his endeavours towards it did but &s;till more literally accompli&s;h our Saviour's prediction, that not one &s;tone &s;hould be left upon another.</P>
<P>The ancient Chri&s;tians were &s;o entire|ly per&s;uaded of the force of our Saviour's prophecies, and of the puni&s;hment which the <HI>Jews</HI> had drawn upon them&s;elves,
<PB N="68" REF="96">
and upon their children, for the treat|ment which the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> had received at their hands, that they did not doubt but they would always remain an abandoned and di&s;per&s;ed people, an hi&s;&s;ing and an a&s;toni&s;hment among the nations, as they are to this day. In &s;hort, that they had lo&s;t their peculiarity of being God's peo|ple, which was now transferred to the body of Chri&s;tians, and which pre&s;erved the Church of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> among all the con|flicts, difficulties and per&s;ecutions, in which it was engaged, as it had pre|&s;erved the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> government and oeco|nomy for &s;o many ages, whil&s;t it had the &s;ame truth and vital principle in it, not|with&s;tanding it was &s;o frequently in dan|ger of being utterly aboli&s;hed and de|&s;troyed, <HI>Origen,</HI> in his fourth book a|gain&s;t <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> mentioning their being ca&s;t out of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the place to which their wor&s;hip was annexed, deprived of their temple and &s;acrifice, their religious rites and &s;olemnities, and &s;cattered over the face of the earth, ventures to a&s;&s;ure them with a face of confidence, that they would never be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;ince they had committed that horrid crime again&s;t the Saviour of the world. This was a
<PB N="69" REF="97">
bold a&s;&s;ertion in the good man, who knew how this people had been &s;o won|derfully re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in former times, when they were almo&s;t &s;wallowed up, and in the mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;tate of de&s;ola|tion, as in their deliverance out of the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> captivity, and the oppre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes.</HI> Nay, he knew that within le&s;s than a hundred years be|fore his own time, the <HI>Jews</HI> had made &s;uch a powerful effort for their re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment under <HI>Barchocab,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Adrian,</HI> as &s;hook the whole <HI>Roman</HI> empire. But he founded his opinion on a &s;ure word of prophecy, and on the pu|ni&s;hment they had &s;o ju&s;tly incurred; and we find, by a long experience of 1500 years, that he was not mi&s;taken, nay that his opinion gathers &s;trength daily, &s;ince the <HI>Jews</HI> are now at a greater di&s;tance from any probability of &s;uch a re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, than they were when <HI>Origen</HI> wrote.</P>

I mean the lives and manners of tho&s;e holy men, who believed in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> during the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity.

But this will be found an indi&s;putable truth, if we form our calculation upon the opinions which pre|vailed in tho&s;e days, that every one who lives in the habitual practice of any vo|luntary &s;in, actually cuts him&s;elf off from the benefits and profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tiani|ty, and whatever he may call him&s;elf, is in reality no Chri&s;tian, nor ought to be e&s;teemed as &s;uch.</P>

the minds of the ignorant to the know|ledge and wor&s;hip of him that made them, and in&s;pired the vicious with a rational devotion, a &s;trict purity of heart, and an unbounded love to their fellow-creatures. In proportion as it &s;pread through the world, it &s;eemed to change mankind into another &s;pecies of Beings. No &s;ooner was a convert initiated into it, but by an ea&s;y figure he became a New Man, and both acted and looked upon him&s;elf as one regenerated and born a &s;econd time into another &s;tate of exi|&s;tence.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to be more particular in the accounts of primitive Chri&s;tianity, which have been exhibited &s;o well by others, but rather to ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Pagan</HI> converts, of whom I am now &s;peaking, mention this great refor|mation of tho&s;e who had been the great|e&s;t &s;inners, with that &s;udden and &s;ur|pri&s;ing change which it made in the lives of the mo&s;t profligate, as having &s;ome|thing in it &s;upernatural, miraculous, and more than human. <HI>Origen</HI> repre&s;ents this power in the Chri&s;tian religion, as no le&s;s wonderful than that of curing the lame and blind, or clean&s;ing the leper.
<PB N="73" REF="101">
Many others repre&s;ent it in the &s;ame light, and looked upon it as an argument that there was a certain divinity in that religion, which &s;howed it &s;elf in &s;uch &s;trange and glorious effects.</P>
<P N="4">IV. This therefore was a great means not only of recommending Chri&s;tianity to hone&s;t and learned heathens, but of confirming them in the belief of our Sa|viour's hi&s;tory, when they &s;aw multitudes of virtuous men daily forming them&s;elves upon his example, animated by his pre|cepts, and actuated by that Spirit which he had promi&s;ed to &s;end among his Di&s;|ciples.</P>
<P N="5">V. But I find no argument made a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the&s;e eminent <HI>Pagan</HI> converts, for &s;trengthen|ing their faith in the hi&s;tory of our Sa|viour, than the predictions relating to him in tho&s;e old prophetick writings, which were depo&s;ited among the hands of the greate&s;t enemies to Chri&s;tianity, and owned by them to have been extant many ages before his appearance. The learned heathen converts were a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee the whole hi&s;tory of their Saviour's life publi&s;hed before he was born, and to find that the Evangeli&s;ts and Prophets,
<PB N="74" REF="102">
in their accounts of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> differed only in point of time, the one foretel|ling what &s;hould happen to him, and the other de&s;cribing tho&s;e very particulars as what had actually happened. This our Saviour him&s;elf was plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of as the &s;tronge&s;t argument of his being the promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and without it would hardly have reconciled his Di&s;|ciples to the ignominy of his death, as in that remarkable pa&s;&s;age which men|tions his conver&s;ation with the two Di&s;|ciples, on the day of his re&s;urrection. St. <HI>Luke.</HI> xxiv.13. to the end.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The heathen converts, after ha|ving travelled through all human learn|ing, and fortified their minds with the knowledge of arts and &s;ciences, were par|ticularly qualified to examine the&s;e pro|phecies with great care and impartiality, and without prejudice or prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. If the <HI>Jews</HI> on the one &s;ide put an unna|tural interpretation on the&s;e prophecies, to evade the force of them in their con|trover&s;ies with the Chri&s;tians; or if the Chri&s;tians on the other &s;ide over-&s;trained &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in their applications of them, as it often happens among men of the be&s;t under&s;tanding, when their minds
<PB N="75" REF="103">
are heated with any con&s;ideration that bears a more than ordinary weight with it: the learned Heathens may be looked upon as neuters in the matter, when all the&s;e prophecies were new to them, and their education had left the interpreta|tion of them free and indifferent. Be|&s;ides, the&s;e learned men among the pri|mitive Chri&s;tians, knew how the <HI>Jews,</HI> who had preceded our Saviour, inter|preted the&s;e predictions, and the &s;everal marks by which they acknowledged the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> would be di&s;covered, and how tho&s;e of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Doctors who &s;uc|ceeded him, had deviated from the inter|pretations and doctrines of their forefa|thers, on purpo&s;e to &s;tifle their own con|viction.</P>
<P N="7">VII. This &s;et of arguments had there|fore an invincible force with tho&s;e <HI>Pa|gan</HI> Philo&s;ophers who became Chri&s;tians, as we find in mo&s;t of their writings. They could not disbelieve our Saviour's hi&s;tory, which &s;o exactly agreed with every thing that had been written of him many ages before his birth, nor doubt of tho&s;e circum&s;tances being fulfilled in him, which could not be true of any per&s;on that lived in the world be&s;ides
<PB N="76" REF="104">
him&s;elf. This wrought the greate&s;t confu&s;ion in the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> and the greate&s;t conviction in the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who every where &s;peak with a&s;toni&s;h|ment of the&s;e truths they met with in this new magazine of learning which was opened to them, and carry the point &s;o far as to think whatever excellent do|ctrine they had met with among <HI>Pagan</HI> writers, had been &s;tole from their con|ver&s;ation with the <HI>Jews,</HI> or from the peru&s;al of the&s;e writings which they had in their cu&s;tody.</P>

<P><HI>_SIMONIDES</HI> being ask'd by <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> the tyrant what God was, de&s;ired a day's time to con&s;ider of it before he made his reply. When the day was expired, he de&s;ired two days; and afterwards, in&s;tead of returning his an&s;wer, demanded &s;till double the time to con&s;ider of it. This great poet and philo&s;opher, the more he contemplated the nature of the Deity, found that he
<PB N="78" REF="106">
waded but the more out of his depth; and that he lo&s;t him&s;elf in the thought, in&s;tead of finding an end of it.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the Idea which wi&s;e men, by the light of rea&s;on, have framed of the Divine Being, it amounts to this: That he has in him all the perfection of a &s;piritual nature; and &s;ince we have no notion of any kind of &s;piritual perfection but what we di&s;cover in our own &s;ouls, we join Infinitude to each kind of the&s;e perfections, and what is a faculty in an human &s;oul becomes an attribute in God. <HI>We</HI> exi&s;t in place and time, the Divine Being fills the immen&s;ity of &s;pace with his pre&s;ence, and inhabits teernity. <HI>We</HI> are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a little power and a little knowledge, the Divine Being is Almigh|ty and Omni&s;cient. In &s;hort, by adding Infinity to any kind of perfection we en|joy, and by joining all the&s;e different kinds of perfections in one Being, we form our idea of the great Sovereign of nature.</P>
<P>Though every one who thinks mu&s;t have made this ob&s;ervation, I &s;hall pro|duce Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s authority to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, out of his e&s;&s;ay on human un|der&s;tanding.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">If we examine the idea
<PB N="79" REF="107">
we have of the incomprehen&s;ible &s;u|preme Being, we &s;hall find, that we come by it the &s;ame way; and that the complex <HI>ideas</HI> we have both of God and &s;eparate &s;pirits, are made up of the &s;imple <HI>ideas</HI> we receive from <HI>reflection: v. g.</HI> having from what we experiment in our &s;elves, got the <HI>ideas</HI> of exi&s;tence and duration, of knowledge and pow|er, of plea&s;ure and happine&s;s, and of &s;e|veral other qualities and powers, which it is better to have, than to be with|out; when we would frame an <HI>idea</HI> the mo&s;t &s;uitable we can to the &s;upreme Being, we enlarge every one of the&s;e with our <HI>idea</HI> of infinity; and &s;o put|ting them together, make our complex <HI>idea of God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible that there may be many kinds of &s;piritual perfection, be&s;ides tho&s;e which are lodged in an human &s;oul; but it is impo&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould have ideas of any kinds of perfection, except tho&s;e of which we have &s;ome &s;mall rays and &s;hort imperfect &s;trokes in our &s;elves. It would be therefore a very high pre&s;um|ption to determine whether the &s;upreme Being has not many more attributes than tho&s;e which enter into our conceptions
<PB N="80" REF="108">
of him. This is certain, that if there be any kind of &s;piritual perfection which is not marked out in an human &s;oul, it belongs in its fulne&s;s to the Divine Na|ture.</P>
<P>Several eminent Philo&s;ophers have ima|gined that the &s;oul, in her &s;eparate &s;tate, may have new faculties &s;pringing up in her, which &s;he is not capable of exerting during her pre&s;ent union with the body, and whether the&s;e faculties may not cor|re&s;pond with other attributes in the Di|vine Nature, and open to us hereafter new matter of wonder and adoration, we are altogether ignorant. This, as I have &s;aid before, we ought to acquie&s;ce in, that the Sovereign Being, the great Author of Nature, has in him all po&s;&s;ible perfection, as well in <HI>kind</HI> as in <HI>degree</HI>; to &s;peak ac|cording to our methods of conceiving. I &s;hall only add under this head, that when we have rai&s;ed our notion of this infinite Being as high as it is po&s;&s;ible for the mind of man to go, it will fall infinitely &s;hort of what he really is. <HI>There is no end of his greatne&s;s:</HI> The mo&s;t exalted creature he has made, is only capable of adoring it, none but him&s;elf can comprehend it.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="109">The advice of the &s;on of <HI>Sirach</HI> is ve|ry ju&s;t and &s;ublime in this light. <HI>By his word all things con&s;i&s;t. We may &s;peak much, and yet come &s;hort: wherefore in &s;um, he is all. How &s;hall we be able to magnify him? For he is great above all his works. The Lord is terrible and very great; and marvellous in his power. When you glorify the Lord, exalt him as much as you can; for even yet will he far exceed. And when you exalt him, put forth all your &s;trength, and be not weary; for you can never go far enough. Who hath &s;een him, that he might tell us? And who can magnify him as he is? There are yet hid greater things than the&s;e be, for we have &s;een but a few of his works.</HI></P>
<P>I have here only con&s;idered the Su|preme Being by the light of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy. If we would &s;ee him in all the wonders of his mercy we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to revelation, which repre&s;ents him to us, not only as infinitely great and glorious, but as infinitely good and ju&s;t in his di&s;pen&s;ations towards man. But as this is a theory which falls under every one's con&s;ideration, tho' indeed it can never be &s;ufficiently con&s;idered, I &s;hall here only take notice of that habi|tual wor&s;hip and veneration which we
<PB N="82" REF="110">
ought to pay to this Almighty Being. We &s;hould often refre&s;h our minds with the thought of him, and annihilate our &s;elves before him, in the contemplation of our own worthle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and of his tran|&s;cendent excellency and perfection. This would imprint in our minds &s;uch a con|&s;tant and uninterrupted awe and venera|tion as that which I am here recommend|ing, and which is in reality a kind of ince&s;&s;ant prayer, and rea&s;onable humilia|tion of the &s;oul before him who made it.</P>
<P>This would effectually kill in us all the little &s;eeds of pride, vanity and &s;elf-conceit, which are apt to &s;hoot up in the minds of &s;uch who&s;e thoughts turn more on tho&s;e comparative advantages which they enjoy over &s;ome of their fel|low-creatures, than on that infinite di|&s;tance which is placed between them and the &s;upreme model of all perfection. It would likewi&s;e quicken our de&s;ires and endeavours of uniting our &s;elves to him by all the acts of religion and virtue.</P>
<P>Such an habitual homage to the Su|preme Being would, in a particular man|ner, bani&s;h from among us that prevail|ing impiety of u&s;ing his name on the mo&s;t trivial occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="111">I find the following pa&s;&s;age in an ex|cellent &s;ermon, preached at the funeral of a gentleman who was an honour to his country, and a more diligent as well as &s;ucce&s;sful enquirer into the works of nature, than any other our nation has ever produced.

<P>I Was ye&s;terday about &s;un-&s;et walking in the open fields, 'till the night in|&s;en&s;ibly fell upon me. I at fir&s;t amu&s;ed my &s;elf with all the richne&s;s and variety of colours, which appeared in the we|&s;tern parts of heaven: In proportion as they faded away and went out, &s;everal &s;tars and planets appeared one after ano|ther, 'till the whole firmament was in a glow. The bluene&s;s of the <HI>Aether</HI> was exceedingly heightened and enlivened by the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and by the rays of all tho&s;e luminaries that pa&s;&s;ed thro' it. The <HI>Galaxy</HI> appeared in its mo&s;t beau|tiful white. To compleat the &s;cene, the full moon ro&s;e at length in that clouded maje&s;ty, which <HI>Milton</HI> takes notice of, and opened to the eye a new picture of
<PB N="85" REF="113">
nature, which was more finely &s;haded, and di&s;po&s;ed among &s;ofter lights, than that which the &s;un had before di&s;covered to us.</P>
<P>As I was &s;urveying the moon walking in her brightne&s;s, and taking her pro|gre&s;s among the con&s;tellations, a thought ro&s;e in me which I believe very often perplexes and di&s;turbs men of &s;erious and contemplative natures. <HI>David</HI> him&s;elf fell into it in that reflection, <HI>When I con|&s;ider the heavens the work of thy fingers, the moon and the &s;tars which thou ha&s;t or|dained; what is man that thou art mindful of him, and the &s;on of man that thou re|garde&s;t him!</HI> In the &s;ame manner when I con&s;idered that infinite ho&s;t of &s;tars, or, to &s;peak more philo&s;ophically, of &s;uns, which were then &s;hining upon me, with tho&s;e innumerable &s;ets of planets or worlds, which were moving round their re&s;pective &s;uns; when I &s;till enlar|ged the idea, and &s;uppo&s;ed another hea|ven of &s;uns and worlds ri&s;ing &s;till above this which we di&s;covered, and the&s;e &s;till enlightned by a &s;uperior firmament of luminaries, which are planted at &s;o great a di&s;tance, that they may appear to the inhabitants of the former as the &s;tars do to us; in &s;hort, whil&s;t I pur&s;ued this
<PB N="86" REF="114">
thought, I could not but reflect on that little in&s;ignificant figure which I my &s;elf bore amid&s;t the immen&s;ity of God's works.</P>
<P>Were the &s;un, which enlightens this part of the creation, with all the ho&s;t of planetary worlds that move about him, utterly extingui&s;hed and annihilated; they would not be mi&s;&s;ed more than a grain of &s;and upon the &s;ea-&s;hore. The &s;pace they po&s;&s;e&s;s is &s;o exceedingly lit|tle in campari&s;on of the whole, that it would &s;carce make a <HI>blank</HI> in the crea|tion. The cha&s;m would be impercepti|ble to an eye, that could take in the whole compa&s;s of nature, and pa&s;s from one end of the creation to the other; as it is po&s;&s;ible there may be &s;uch a &s;en&s;e in our &s;elves hereafter, or in creatures which are at pre&s;ent more exalted than our &s;elves. We &s;ee many &s;tars by the help of gla&s;&s;es, which we do not di&s;cover with our naked eyes; and the finer our tele&s;copes are, the more &s;till are our di&s;|coveries. <HI>Huygenius</HI> carries this thought &s;o far, that he does not think it impo&s;&s;i|ble there may be &s;tars who&s;e light is not yet travelled down to us, &s;ince their fir&s;t creation. There is no que&s;tion but the
<PB N="87" REF="115">
univer&s;e has certain bounds &s;et to it; but when we con&s;ider that it is the work of infinite power, prompted by infinite goodne&s;s, with an infinite &s;pace to exert it &s;elf in, how can our imagination &s;et any bounds to it?</P>
<P>To return therefore to my fir&s;t thought, I could not but look upon my &s;elf with &s;ecret horror, as a Being that was not worth the &s;malle&s;t regard of one who had &s;o great a work under his care and &s;u|perintendency. I was afraid of being overlooked amid&s;t the immen&s;ity of na|ture, and lo&s;t among that infinite variety of creatures, which in all probability &s;warm through all the&s;e immea&s;urable regions of matter.</P>
<P>In order to recover my &s;elf from this mortifying thought, I con&s;idered that it took its ri&s;e from tho&s;e narrow concep|tions, which we are apt to entertain of the Divine Nature. We our &s;elves can|not attend to many different objects at the &s;ame time. If we are careful to in|&s;pect &s;ome things, we mu&s;t of cour&s;e neglect others. This imperfection which we ob&s;erve in our &s;elves, is an imperfe|ction that cleaves in &s;ome degree to crea|tures of the highe&s;t capacities, as they
<PB N="88" REF="116">
are creatures, that is, Beings of finite and limited natures. The pre&s;ence of every created Being is confined to a cer|tain mea&s;ure of &s;pace, and con&s;equently his ob&s;ervation is &s;tinted to a certain number of objects. The &s;phere in which we move, and act, and under&s;tand, is of a wider circumference to one creature than another, according as we ri&s;e one above another in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence. But the wide&s;t of the&s;e our &s;pheres has its circumference. When therefore we reflect on the divine nature, we are &s;o u&s;ed and accu&s;tomed to this imperfection in our &s;elves, that we cannot forbear in &s;ome mea&s;ure a&s;cribing it to him in whom there is no &s;hadow of imperfecti|on. Our rea&s;on indeed a&s;&s;ures us that his attributes are infinite, but the poor|ne&s;s of our conceptions is &s;uch that it cannot forbear &s;etting bounds to every thing it contemplates, till our rea&s;on comes again to our &s;uccour, and throws down all tho&s;e little prejudices which ri&s;e in us unawares, and are natural to the mind of man.</P>
<P>We &s;hall therefore utterly extingui&s;h this melancholy thought, of our being overlooked by our Maker in the multi|plicity
<PB N="89" REF="117">
of his works, and the infinity of tho&s;e objects among which he &s;eems to be ince&s;&s;antly employed, if we con&s;ider, in the fir&s;t place, that he is Omnipre|&s;ent; and, in the &s;econd, that he is Om|ni&s;cient.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider him in his Omnipre|&s;ence: His Being pa&s;&s;es thro', actuates, and &s;upports the whole frame of nature. His creation, and every part of it, is full of him. There is nothing he has made, that is either &s;o di&s;tant, &s;o little, or &s;o incon&s;iderable, which he does not e&s;&s;en|tially inhabit. His &s;ub&s;tance is within the &s;ub&s;tance of every Being, whether material, or immaterial, and as intimate|ly pre&s;ent to it, as that Being is to it &s;elf. It would be an imperfection in him, were he able to remove out of one place into another, or to withdraw him&s;elf from any thing he has created, or from any part of that &s;pace which is diffu&s;ed and &s;pread abroad to infinity. In &s;hort, to &s;peak of him in the language of the old philo&s;opher, he is a Being who&s;e centre is every where, and his circumference no where.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, he is Omni&s;cient as well as Omnipre&s;ent. His Omni&s;cience
<PB N="90" REF="118">
indeed nece&s;&s;arily and naturally flows from his Omnipre&s;ence; he cannot but be con&s;cious of every motion that ari&s;es in the whole material world, which he thus e&s;&s;entially pervades, and of every thought that is &s;tirring in the intellectual world, to every part of which he is thus intimately united. Several morali&s;ts have con&s;idered the creation as the temple of God, which he has built with his own hands, and which is filled with his pre|&s;ence. Others have con&s;idered infinite &s;pace as the receptacle, or rather the habi|tation of the Almighty: But the noble&s;t and mo&s;t exalted way of con&s;idering this infinite &s;pace is that of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> who calls it the <HI>Sen&s;orium</HI> of the God|head. Brutes and men have their <HI>Sen&s;o|riola,</HI> or little <HI>Sen&s;oriums,</HI> by which they apprehend the pre&s;ence and perceive the actions of a few objects, that lie conti|guous to them. Their knowledge and ob&s;ervation turns within a very narrow circle. But as God Almighty cannot but perceive and know every thing in which he re&s;ides, infinite &s;pace gives room to infinite knowledge, and is, as it were, an organ to Omni&s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="119">Were the &s;oul &s;eparate from the bo|dy, and with one glance of thought &s;hould &s;tart beyond the bounds of the creation, &s;hould it for millions of years continue its progre&s;s through infinite &s;pace with the &s;ame activity, it would &s;till find it &s;elf within the embrace of its creator, and encompa&s;&s;ed round with the immen&s;ity of the Godhead. Whil&s;t we are in the body he is not le&s;s pre&s;ent with us, becau&s;e he is concealed from us. <HI>O that I knew where I might find him!</HI> &s;ays <HI>Job. Behold I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot per|ceive him. On the left hand, where he does work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth him&s;elf on the right hand that I cannot &s;ee him.</HI> In &s;hort, rea&s;on as well as revela|tion a&s;&s;ures us, that he cannot be ab&s;ent from us, notwith&s;tanding he is undi&s;co|vered by us.</P>
<P>In this con&s;ideration of God Almigh|ty's Omnipre&s;ence and Omni&s;cience eve|ry uncomfortable thought vani&s;hes. He cannot but regard every thing that has being, e&s;pecially &s;uch of his creatures who fear they are not regarded by him. He is privy to all their thoughts, and to that anxiety of heart in particular, which is
<PB N="92" REF="120">
apt to trouble them on this occa&s;ion: For, as it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould over|look any of his creatures, &s;o we may be confident that he regards, with an eye of mercy, tho&s;e who endeavour to re|commend them&s;elves to his notice, and in an unfeigned humility of heart think them&s;elves unworthy that he &s;hould be mindful of them.</P>

<P>IN your paper of <HI>Friday</HI> the 9th in|&s;tant, you had occa&s;ion to con&s;ider the Ubiquity of the Godhead, and at the &s;ame time to &s;hew, that as he is pre&s;ent to every thing, he cannot but be atten|tive to every thing, and privy to all the modes and parts of its exi&s;tence; or, in other words, that his Omni&s;cience and Omnipre&s;ence are coexi&s;tent, and run to|gether through the whole infinitude of &s;pace. This con&s;ideration might furni&s;h us with many incentives to devotion and motives to morality, but as this &s;ubject has been handled by &s;everal excellent wri|ters, I &s;hall con&s;ider it in a light where|in I have not &s;een it placed by others.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="121"><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> How di&s;con&s;olate is the condi|tion of an intellectual Being who is thus pre&s;ent with his Maker, but at the &s;ame time receives no extraordinary benefit or advantage from this his pre&s;ence!</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> How deplorable is the con|dition of an intellectual Being, who feels no other effect from this his pre&s;ence but &s;uch as proceed from divine wrath and indignation!</P>

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> How di&s;con&s;olate is the condi|tion of an intellectual Being, who is thus pre&s;ent with his Maker, but at the &s;ame time receives no extraordinary benefit or advantage from this his pre&s;ence! E|very particle of matter is actuated by this Almighty Being which pa&s;&s;es through it. The heavens and the earth, the &s;tars and planets, move and gravitate by ver|tue of this great principle within them. All the dead parts of nature are invigo|rated by the pre&s;ence of their Creator, and made capable of exerting their re&s;pe|ctive qualities. The &s;everal in&s;tincts, in the brute creation, do likewi&s;e operate and work towards the &s;everal ends which
<PB N="94" REF="122">
are agreeable to them, by this divine energy. Man only, who does not co|operate with this holy &s;pirit, and is un|attentive to his pre&s;ence, receives none of tho&s;e advantages from it, which are perfective of his nature, and nece&s;&s;ary to his well-being. The Divinity is with him, and in him, and every where about him, but of no advantage to him. It is the &s;ame thing to a man without reli|gion, as if there were no God in the world. It is indeed impo&s;&s;ible for an in|finite Being to remove him&s;elf from any of his creatures, but though he cannot withdraw his e&s;&s;ence from us, which would argue an imperfection in him, he can withdraw from us all the joys and con&s;olations of it. His pre&s;ence may per|haps be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport us in our exi&s;tence; but he may leave this our ex|i&s;tence to it &s;elf, with regard to its hap|pine&s;s or mi&s;ery. For, in this &s;en&s;e, he may ca&s;t us away from his pre&s;ence, and take his holy &s;pirit from us. This &s;ingle con&s;ideration one would think &s;ufficient to make us open our hearts to all tho&s;e infu&s;ions of joy and gladne&s;s which are &s;o near at hand, and ready to be poured in upon us; e&s;pecially when we con&s;i|der, <HI>Secondly,</HI> The deplorable condition
<PB N="95" REF="123">
of an intellectual Being who feels no o|ther effects from his Maker's pre&s;ence, but &s;uch as proceed from divine wrath and indignation!</P>
<P>We may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that the great Author of nature will not always be as one, who is indifferent to any of his crea|tures. Tho&s;e who will not feel him in his love, will be &s;ure at length to feel him in his di&s;plea&s;ure. And how dread|ful is the condition of that creature, who is only &s;en&s;ible of the Being of his Cre|ator by what he &s;uffers from him! He is as e&s;&s;entially pre&s;ent in hell as in heaven, but the inhabitants of tho&s;e accur&s;ed places behold him only in his wrath, and &s;hrink within the flames to conceal them|&s;elves from him. It is not in the power of imagination to conceive the fearful effect of Omnipotence incen&s;ed.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall only con&s;ider the wretched|ne&s;s of an intellectual Being, who, in this life, lies under the di&s;plea&s;ure of him, that at all times and in all places is inti|mately united with him. He is able to di&s;quiet the &s;oul, and vex it in all its faculties. He can hinder any of the great|e&s;t comforts of life from refre&s;hing us, and give an edge to every one of its lighte&s;t calamities. Who then can bear
<PB N="96" REF="124">
the thought of being an out-ca&s;t from his pre&s;ence, that is, from the comforts of it, or of feeling it only in its terrors? How pathetick is that expo&s;tulation of <HI>Job,</HI> when, for the tryal of his patience, he was made to look upon him&s;elf in this deplorable condition! <HI>Why ha&s;t thou &s;et me as a mark again&s;t thee, &s;o that I am become a burthen to my &s;elf?</HI> But, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> how happy is the condition of that intel|lectual Being, who is &s;en&s;ible of his Ma|ker's pre&s;ence from the &s;ecret effects of his mercy and loving-kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Ble&s;&s;ed in heaven behold him face to face; that is, are as &s;en&s;ible of his pre&s;ence as we are of the pre&s;ence of any per&s;on whom we look upon with our eyes. There is doubtle&s;s a faculty in Spi|rits, by which they apprehend one ano|ther, as our &s;en&s;es do material objects; and there is no que&s;tion but our &s;ouls, when they are di&s;embodied, or placed in glorified bodies, will by this faculty, in whatever part of &s;pace they re&s;ide, be al|ways <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> of the divine pre&s;ence. We, who have this veil of fle&s;h &s;tanding be|tween us and the world of &s;pirits, mu&s;t be content to know that the Spirit of God is pre&s;ent with us, by the effects which he produceth in us. Our outward &s;en&s;es are
<PB N="97" REF="125">
too gro&s;s to apprehend him; we may however ta&s;te and &s;ee how gracious he is, by his influence upon our minds, by tho&s;e virtuous thoughts which he awa|kens in us, by tho&s;e &s;ecret comforts and refre&s;hments which he conveys into our &s;ouls, and by tho&s;e ravi&s;hing joys and inward &s;atisfactions, which are perpetu|ally &s;pringing up, and diffu&s;ing them|&s;elves among all the thoughts of good men. He is lodged in our very e&s;&s;ence, and is as a &s;oul within the &s;oul, to irra|diate its under&s;tanding, rectify its will, purify its pa&s;&s;ions, and enliven all the powers of man. How happy therefore is an intellectual Being, who, by prayer and meditation, by virtue and good works, opens this communication between God and his own &s;oul! Tho' the whole crea|tion frowns upon him, and all nature looks black about him, he has his light and &s;upport within him, that are able to cheer his mind, and bear him up in the mid&s;t of all tho&s;e horrors which encom|pa&s;s him. He knows that his helper is at hand, and is always nearer to him than any thing el&s;e can be, which is capable of annoying or terrifying him. In the mid&s;t of calumny or contempt, he at|tends to that Being who whi&s;pers better
<PB N="98" REF="126">
things within his &s;oul, and whom he looks upon as his defender, his glory, and the lifter-up of his head. In his deepe&s;t &s;olitude and retirement, he knows that he is in company with the greate&s;t of Beings; and perceives within him&s;elf &s;uch real &s;en&s;ations of his pre&s;ence, as are more delightful than any thing that can be met with in the conver&s;ation of his creatures. Even in the hour of death, he con&s;iders the pains of his di&s;&s;olution to be nothing el&s;e but the breaking down of that partition, which &s;tands betwixt his &s;oul, and the &s;ight of that being, who is always pre&s;ent with him, and is about to manife&s;t it &s;elf to him in fulne&s;s of joy.</P>
<P>If we would be thus happy, and thus &s;en&s;ible of our Maker's pre&s;ence, from the &s;ecret effects of his mercy and good|ne&s;s, we mu&s;t keep &s;uch a watch over all our thoughts, that, in the language of the &s;cripture, his &s;oul may have plea&s;ure in us. We mu&s;t take care not to grieve his holy Spirit, and endeavour to make the meditations of our hearts always ac|ceptable in his &s;ight, that he may de|light thus to re&s;ide and dwell in us. The light of nature could direct <HI>Seneca</HI> to this doctrine, in a very remarkable pa&s;&s;age a|mong his epi&s;tles; <HI>Sacer ine&s;t in nobis &s;pi|ritus
<PB N="99" REF="127">
bonorum malorumque cu&s;tos, &amp; ob&s;er|vator, &amp; quemadmodum nos illam tracta|mus, ita &amp; ille nos.</HI> There is a holy Spi|rit re&s;iding in us, who watches and ob|&s;erves both good and evil men, and will treat us after the &s;ame manner that we treat him. But I &s;hall conclude this di&s;|cour&s;e with tho&s;e more emphatical words in divine revelation, <HI>If a man love me, he will keep my word, and my father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Con&s;idered in my two la&s;t letters that awful and tremendous &s;ubject, the Ubiquity or Omnipre&s;ence of the Divine Being. I have &s;hewn that he is equally pre&s;ent in all places through|out the whole extent of infinite &s;pace. This doctrine is &s;o agreeable to rea&s;on, that we meet with it in the writings of the enlightened heathens, as I might &s;how at large, were it not already done by other hands. But tho' the Deity be thus e&s;&s;entially pre&s;ent through all
<PB N="100" REF="128">
the immen&s;ity of &s;pace, there is one part of it in which he di&s;covers him|&s;elf in a mo&s;t tran&s;cendent and vi&s;ible glory. This is that place which is marked out in &s;cripture under the dif|ferent appellations of <HI>paradi&s;e, the third heaven, the throne of God, and the habi|tation of his glory.</HI> It is here where the glorified body of our Saviour re&s;ides, and where all the cele&s;tial hierarchies, and the innumerable ho&s;ts of Angels, are repre&s;ented as perpetually &s;urround|ing the &s;eat of God with <HI>hallelujahs</HI> and hymns of prai&s;e. This is that pre|&s;ence of God which &s;ome of the divines call his glorious, and others his maje|&s;tatick pre&s;ence. He is indeed as e&s;&s;en|tially pre&s;ent in all other places as in this, but it is here where he re&s;ides in a &s;en|&s;ible magnificence, and in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e &s;plendors which can affect the imagination of created Beings.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable that this opi|nion of God Almighty's pre&s;ence in heaven, whether di&s;covered by the light of nature, or by a general tradition from our fir&s;t parents, prevails among all the nations of the world, what&s;oever diffe|rent notions they entertain of the God|head. If you look into <HI>Homer,</HI> that is,
<PB N="101" REF="129">
the mo&s;t ancient of the <HI>Greek</HI> writers, you &s;ee the Supreme Powers &s;eated in the heavens, and encompa&s;&s;ed with in|ferior Deities, among whom the Mu&s;es are repre&s;ented as &s;inging ince&s;&s;antly about his throne. Who does not here &s;ee the main &s;trokes and outlines of this great truth we are &s;peaking of? The &s;ame doctrine is &s;hadowed out in many other heathen authors, tho' at the &s;ame time, like &s;everal other revealed truths, da&s;hed and adulterated with a mixture of fables and human inventions. But to pa&s;s over the notions of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> tho&s;e more enlightened parts of the <HI>Pagan</HI> world, we find there is &s;carce a people among the late di&s;|covered nations who are not trained up in an opinion, that heaven is the habi|tation of the Divinity whom they wor|&s;hip.</P>
<P>As in <HI>Solomon</HI>'s temple there was the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> in which a vi&s;ible glory appeared among the figures of the Cherubims, and into which none but the high prie&s;t him&s;elf was permit|ted to enter, after having made an atonement for the &s;ins of the people; &s;o if we con&s;ider the whole creation as one great temple, there is in it this Ho|ly
<PB N="102" REF="130">
of Holies, into which the high prie&s;t of our &s;alvation entered, and took his place among Angels and Archangels, after having made a propitiation for the &s;ins of mankind.</P>
<P>With how much skill mu&s;t the throne of God be erected? With what glo|rious de&s;igns is that habitation beauti|fied, which is contrived and built by him who in&s;pired <HI>Hyram</HI> with wi&s;dom? How great mu&s;t be the maje&s;ty of that place, where the whole art of creation has been employed, and where God has cho&s;en to &s;how him&s;elf in the mo&s;t magnificent manner? What mu&s;t be the architecture of infinite power under the direction of infinite wi&s;dom? A &s;pi|rit cannot but be tran&s;ported after an ineffable manner, with the &s;ight of tho&s;e objects, which were made to affect him by that Being who knows the inward frame of a &s;oul, and how to plea&s;e and ravi&s;h it in all its mo&s;t &s;ecret powers and faculties. It is to this maje&s;tatick pre&s;ence of God, we may apply tho&s;e beautiful expre&s;&s;ions in holy writ: <HI>Be|hold even to the moon, and it &s;hineth not; yea the &s;tars are not pure in his &s;ight.</HI> The light of the &s;un, and all the glories of the world in which we live, are but
<PB N="103" REF="131">
as weak and &s;ickly glimmerings, or ra|ther darkne&s;s it&s;elf, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e &s;plendors which encompa&s;s the throne of God.</P>
<P>As the <HI>glory</HI> of this place is tran&s;cen|dent beyond imagination, &s;o probably is the <HI>extent</HI> of it. There is light be|hind light, and glory within glory. How far that &s;pace may reach, in which God thus appears in perfect maje&s;ty, we cannot po&s;&s;ibly conceive. Tho' it is not infinite, it may be indefinite; and though not immea&s;urable in it &s;elf, it may be &s;o with regard to any created eye or imagination. If he has made the&s;e lower regions of matter &s;o incon|ceivably wide and magnificent for the habitation of mortal and peri&s;hable Be|ings, how great may we &s;uppo&s;e the courts of his hou&s;e to be, where he makes his re&s;idence in a more e&s;pecial manner, and di&s;plays him&s;elf in the ful|ne&s;s of his glory, among an innumera|ble company of Angels, and Spirits of ju&s;t men made perfect?</P>
<P>This is certain, that our imagina|tions cannot be rai&s;ed too high, when we think on a place where Omnipo|tence and Omni&s;cience have &s;o &s;ignal|ly exerted them&s;elves, becau&s;e that they
<PB N="104" REF="132">
are able to produce a Scene infinitely more great and glorious than what we are able to imagine. It is not impo&s;&s;i|ble but at the con&s;ummation of all things, the&s;e outward apartments of na|ture, which are now &s;uited to tho&s;e Beings who inhabit them, may be ta|ken in and added to that glorious place of which I am here &s;peaking; and by that means made a proper habitation for Beings who are exempt from mor|tality, and cleared of their imperfecti|ons: For &s;o the &s;cripture &s;eems to in|timate when it &s;peaks of new heavens and of a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I have only con&s;idered this glorious place, with regard to the &s;ight and ima|gination, though it is highly probable that our other &s;en&s;es may here likewi&s;e enjoy their highe&s;t gratifications. There is nothing which more ravi&s;hes and tran|&s;ports the &s;oul, than harmony; and we have great rea&s;on to believe, from the de&s;criptions of this place in Holy Scri|ture, that this is one of the entertain|ments of it. And if the &s;oul of man can be &s;o wonderfully affected with tho&s;e &s;trains of mu&s;ick, which human art is capable of producing, how much
<PB N="105" REF="133">
more will it be rai&s;ed and elevated by tho&s;e, in which is exerted the whole power of harmony! The &s;en&s;es are fa|culties of the human &s;oul, though they cannot be employed, during this our vital union, without proper in&s;truments in the body. Why therefore &s;hould we exclude the &s;atisfaction of the&s;e faculties, which we find by experience are inlets of great plea&s;ure to the &s;oul, from among tho&s;e entertainments which are to make up our happine&s;s hereaf|ter? Why &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e that our hearing and &s;eeing will not be gratify'd with tho&s;e objects which are mo&s;t a|greeable to them, and which they can|not meet with in the&s;e lower regions of nature; objects, <HI>which neither eye hath &s;een, nor ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive? I knew a man in Chri&s;t</HI> (&s;ays St. <HI>Paul,</HI> &s;peaking of him&s;elf) <HI>above fourteen years ago (whe|ther in the body, I cannot tell, or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God know|eth) &s;uch a one caught up to the third hea|ven. And I knew &s;uch a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth) how that he was caught up into paradi&s;e, and heard un&s;peakable words, which it is not po&s;&s;ible for a man to
<PB N="106" REF="134">
utter.</HI> By this is meant, that what he heard was &s;o infinitely different from any thing which he had heard in this world, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s it in &s;uch words as might convey a no|tion of it to his hearers.</P>
<P>It is very natural for us to take de|light in enquiries concerning any fo|reign Country, where we are &s;ome time or other to make our abode; and as we all hope to be admitted into this glorious place, it is both a laudable and u&s;eful curio&s;ity, to get what infor|mations we can of it, whilst we make u&s;e of revelation for our guide. When the&s;e everla&s;ting doors &s;hall be open to us, we may be &s;ure that the plea&s;ures and beauties of this place will infinite|ly tran&s;cend our pre&s;ent hopes and ex|pectations, and that the glorious ap|pearance of the throne of God, will ri&s;e infinitely beyond whatever we are able to conceive of it. We might here entertain our &s;elves with many other &s;peculations on this &s;ubject, from tho&s;e &s;everal hints which we find of it in the holy &s;criptures; as whether there may not be different man&s;ions and a|partments of glory, to Beings of different natures; whether as they excel one
<PB N="107" REF="135">
another in perfection, they are not ad|mitted nearer to the throne of the Al|mighty, and enjoy greater manife&s;ta|tions of his pre&s;ence; whether there are not &s;olemn times and occa&s;ions, when all the multitude of heaven ce|lebrate the pre&s;ence of their Maker in more extraordinary forms of prai&s;e and adoration; as <HI>Adam,</HI> though he had continued in a &s;tate of innocence, would, in the opinion of our Divines, have kept holy the Sabbath-day, in a more particular manner than any other of the &s;even. The&s;e, and the like &s;pecu|lations, we may very innocently in|dulge, &s;o long as we make u&s;e of them to in&s;pire us with a de&s;ire of becoming inhabitants of this delightful place.</P>
<P>I have in this, and in two foregoing letters, treated on the mo&s;t &s;erious &s;ub|ject that can employ the mind of man, the Omnipre&s;ence of the Deity; a &s;ubject which, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;hould ne|ver depart from our meditations. We have con&s;idered the Divine Being, as he inhabits infinitude, as he dwells a|mong his work, as he is pre&s;ent to the mind of man, and as he di&s;covers him|&s;elf in a more glorious manner among the regions of the Ble&s;t. Such a con|&s;ideration
<PB N="108" REF="136">
&s;hould be kept awake in us at all times, and in all places, and po&s;|&s;e&s;s our minds with a perpetual awe and reverence. It &s;hould be interwo|ven with all our thoughts and percep|tions, and become one with the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our own Being. It is not to be reflected on in the coldne&s;s of philo&s;ophy, but ought to &s;ink us into the lowe&s;t pro&s;tration before him, who is &s;o a&s;toni&s;hingly great, wonderful and holy.</P>

<P>WE con&s;ider infinite &s;pace as an ex|pan&s;ion without a circumference: We con&s;ider eternity, or infinite durati|on, as a line that has neither a begin|ning nor end. In our &s;peculations of in|finite &s;pace, we con&s;ider that particular place in which we exi&s;t, as a kind of center to the whole expan&s;ion. In our
<PB N="109" REF="137">
&s;peculations of eternity, we con&s;ider the time which is pre&s;ent to us as the mid|dle, which divides the whole line into two equal parts. For this rea&s;on, many witty authors compare the pre&s;ent time to an I&s;thmus or narrow neck of land, that ri&s;es in the mid&s;t of an ocean, im|mea&s;urably diffu&s;ed on either &s;ide of it.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy, and indeed common &s;en&s;e, naturally throws eternity under two divi|&s;ions; which we may call in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that eternity which is pa&s;t, and that eternity which is to come. The learned terms of <HI>aeternitas a parte ante,</HI> and <HI>aeternitas a parte po&s;t,</HI> may be more amu&s;ing to the reader, but can have no other idea affixed to them than what is conveyed to us by tho&s;e words, an eternity that is pa&s;t, and an eternity that is to come. Each of the&s;e eternities is bounded at the one ex|tream; or, in other words, the former has an end, and the latter a beginning.</P>
<P>Let us fir&s;t of all con&s;ider that eterni|ty which is pa&s;t, re&s;erving that which is to come for the &s;ubject of another paper. The nature of this eternity is utterly in|conceivable by the mind of man: Our rea&s;on demon&s;trates to us that it <HI>has been,</HI> but at the &s;ame time can frame no idea of it, but what is big with ab&s;urdity and
<PB N="110" REF="138">
contradiction. We can have no other conception of any duration which is pa&s;t, than that all of it was once pre&s;ent; and whatever was once pre&s;ent, is at &s;ome certain di&s;tance from us; and whatever is at any certain di&s;tance from us, be the di&s;tance never &s;o remote, cannot be eter|nity. The very notion of any duration's being pa&s;t, implies that it was once pre|&s;ent; for the idea of being once pre&s;ent, is actually included in the idea of its be|ing pa&s;t. This therefore is a depth not to be &s;ounded by human under&s;tanding. We are &s;ure that there has been an eter|nity, and yet contradict our &s;elves when we mea&s;ure this eternity by any notion which we can frame of it.</P>
<P>If we go to the bottom of this mat|ter, we &s;hall find, that the difficulties we meet with in our conceptions of eternity proceed from this &s;ingle rea&s;on, that we can have no other idea of any kind of duration, than that by which we our &s;elves, and all other created Beings, do exi&s;t; which is, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive duration made up of pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come. There is nothing which exi&s;ts after this manner, all the parts of who&s;e exi&s;tence were not once actually pre&s;ent, and con|&s;equently may be reached by a certain
<PB N="111" REF="139">
number of years applied to it. We may a&s;cend as high as we plea&s;e, and employ our Being to that eternity which is to come, in adding millions of years to mil|lions of years, and we can never come up to any fountain-head of duration, to any beginning in eternity: But at the &s;ame time we are &s;ure, that whatever was once pre&s;ent does lye within the reach of numbers, though perhaps we can never be able to put enough of them together for that purpo&s;e. We may as well &s;ay, that any thing may be actually pre&s;ent in any part of infinite &s;pace, which does not lye at a certain di&s;tance from us, as that any part of infinite duration was once actually pre&s;ent, and does not al&s;o lye at &s;ome determined di&s;tance from us. The di&s;tance in both ca&s;es may be im|mea&s;urable and indefinite as to our facul|ties, but our rea&s;on tells us that it can|not be &s;o in it &s;elf. Here therefore is that difficulty which human under&s;tanding is not capable of &s;urmounting. We are &s;ure that &s;omething mu&s;t have exi&s;ted from eternity, and are at the &s;ame time unable to conceive, that any thing which exi&s;ts, according to our notion of exi|&s;tence, can have exi&s;ted from eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="140">It is hard for a reader, who has not rolled this thought in his own mind, to follow in &s;uch an abstracted &s;peculation; but I have been the longer on it, be|cau&s;e I think it is a demon&s;trative argu|ment of the Being and Eternity of a God: And tho' there are many other demon|&s;trations which lead us to this great truth, I do not think we ought to lay a&s;ide any proofs in this matter which the light of rea&s;on has &s;ugge&s;ted to us, e&s;peci|ally when it is &s;uch a one as has been ur|ged by men famous for their penetration and force of under&s;tanding, and which appears altogether conclu&s;ive to tho&s;e who will be at the pains to examine it.</P>
<P>Having thus con&s;idered that eternity which is pa&s;t, according to the be&s;t idea we can frame of it, I &s;hall now draw up tho&s;e &s;everal articles on this &s;ubject which are dictated to us by the light of rea&s;on, and which may be looked upon as the Creed of a Philo&s;opher in this great point.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is certain that no Being could have made it &s;elf; for if &s;o, it mu&s;t have acted before it was, which is a con|tradiction.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That therefore &s;ome Being mu&s;t have exi&s;ted from all eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="141"><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That whatever exi&s;ts after the manner of created Beings, or according to any notions which we have of Exi&s;tence, could not have exi&s;ted from Eternity.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That this eternal Being mu&s;t therefore be the great Author of nature, <HI>The Ancient of Days,</HI> who, being at an in|finite di&s;tance in his perfections from all finite and created Beings, exi&s;ts in a quite different manner from them, and in a manner of which they can have no Idea.</P>
<P>I know that &s;everal of the School-men, who would not be thought ignorant of any thing, have pretended to explain the manner of God's exi&s;tence, by telling us, That he comprehends infinite du|ration in every moment; That eternity is with him a <HI>Punctum &s;tans,</HI> a fixed point; or, which is as good Sen&s;e, an <HI>infinite in&s;tant</HI>; That nothing with refe|rence to his Exi&s;tence is either pa&s;t or to come: To which the ingenious Mr. <HI>Cow|ley</HI> alludes in his de&s;cription of Heaven,
<Q><L>Nothing is there to come, and nothing pa&s;t,</L>
<L>But an Eternal <HI>NOW</HI> does always la&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>For my own part, I look upon the&s;e propo&s;itions as words that have no ideas annexed to them; and think men had better own their ignorance, than advance
<PB N="114" REF="142">
Doctrines by which they mean nothing, and which indeed are &s;elf-contradictory. We cannot be too mode&s;t in our di&s;|qui&s;itions, when we meditate on Him who is environed with &s;o much glory and perfection, who is the &s;ource of Be|ing, the fountain of all that Exi&s;tence which we and his whole Creation derive from him. Let us therefore with the ut|mo&s;t humility acknowledge, that as &s;ome Being mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have ex|i&s;ted from eternity, &s;o this Being does exi&s;t after an incomprehen&s;ible man|ner, &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible for a Being to have exi&s;ted from eternity after our manner or notions of Exi&s;tence. Re|velation confirms the&s;e natural di|ctates of rea&s;on in the accounts which it gives us of the Divine Exi&s;tence, where it tells us, that he is the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day, and for ever; that he is the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> the Be|ginning and the Ending; that a thou|&s;and years are with him as one day, and one day as a thou&s;and years; by which and the like expre&s;&s;ions, we are taught, that his Exi&s;tence, with relation to time or duration, is infinitely different from the Exi&s;tence of any of his creatures, and con&s;equently that it is impo&s;&s;ible for
<PB N="115" REF="143">
us to frame any adequate conceptions of it.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t revelation which he makes of his own Being, he entitles him&s;elf, <HI>I am that I am</HI>; and when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> de&s;ires to know what Name he &s;hall give him in his emba&s;&s;y to <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> he bids him &s;ay that <HI>I am</HI> hath &s;ent you. Our great Creator, by this revelation of him&s;elf, does in a manner exclude every thing el&s;e from a real Exi&s;tence, and di&s;tingui&s;hes him&s;elf from his creatures, as the only Being which truly and really exi&s;ts. The ancient Platonick notion, which was drawn from &s;peculations of eternity, won|derfully agrees with this revelation which God has made of him&s;elf. There is no|thing, &s;ay they, which in reality exi&s;ts, who&s;e Exi&s;tence, as we call it, is pieced up of pa&s;t, pre&s;ent and to come. Such a flitting and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Exi&s;tence is ra|ther a &s;hadow of Exi&s;tence, and &s;ome|thing which is like it, than Exi&s;tence it &s;elf. He only properly exi&s;ts who&s;e Ex|i&s;tence is intirely pre&s;ent; that is, in o|ther words, who exi&s;ts in the mo&s;t per|fect manner, and in &s;uch a manner, as we have no idea of.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this &s;peculation with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">e u&s;eful inference. How can we &s;uffi|ciently
<PB N="116" REF="144">
pro&s;trate our &s;elves and fall down before our Maker, when we con&s;ider that ineffable goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom which con|trived this Exi&s;tenee for finite natures? What mu&s;t be the overflowings of that good-will, which prompted our Creator to adapt Exi&s;tence to Beings, in whom it is not nece&s;&s;ary? E&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that he him&s;elf was before in the compleat po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Exi&s;tence and of Happine&s;s, and in the full enjoyment of Eternity. What man can think of him&s;elf as called out and &s;eparated from nothing, of his being made a con&s;cious, a rea&s;onable and a happy creature, in &s;hort, of being taken in as a &s;harer of his Exi&s;tence and a kind of partner in Eternity, without being &s;wallowed up in wonder, in prai&s;e, in adoration! It is in|deed a thought too big for the mind of man, and rather to be entertained in the &s;ecrecy of devotion, and in the &s;ilence of the &s;oul, than to be expre&s;&s;ed by words.

<P>THOUGH there is a great deal of plea&s;ure in contemplating the material world, by which I mean that &s;y&s;tem of bodies into which Nature has &s;o curiou&s;ly wrought the ma&s;s of dead matter, with the &s;everal relations which tho&s;e bodies bear to one another; there is &s;till, methinks, &s;omething more wonderful and &s;urprizing in contempla|tions on the world of life, by which I mean all tho&s;e animals with which eve|ry part of the univer&s;e is furni&s;hed. The material world is only the &s;hell of the univer&s;e: The world of Life are its in|habitants.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="146">If we con&s;ider tho&s;e parts of the ma|terial world which lie the neare&s;t to us, and are therefore &s;ubject to our ob&s;erva|tions and enquiries, it is amazing to con|&s;ider the infinity of animals with which it is &s;tocked. Every part of matter is peopled: Every green leaf &s;warms with Inhabitants. There is &s;carce a &s;ingle hu|mour in the body of a man, or of any other animal, in which our gla&s;&s;es do not di&s;cover myriads of' living creatures. The &s;urface of animals is al&s;o covered with other animals, which are in the &s;ame manner the ba&s;is of other animals, that live upon it; nay, we find in the mo&s;t &s;olid bodies, as in marble it&s;elf, innume|rable cells and cavities that are crouded with &s;uch imperceptible inhabitants, as are too little for the naked eye to di&s;co|ver. On the other hand, if we, look in|to the more bulky parts of nature, we &s;ee the &s;eas, lakes and rivers teeming with numberle&s;s kinds of living creatures: We find every mountain and mar&s;h, wil|derne&s;s and wood, plentifully &s;tocked with birds and bea&s;ts, and every part of matter affording proper nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies for the livelihood of multi|tudes which inhabit it.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="147">The author of the <HI>Plurality of Worlds</HI> draws a very good argument from this con&s;ideration, for the <HI>Peopling</HI> of every planet; as indeed it &s;eems very probable from the analogy of rea&s;on, that if no part of matter, which we are acquainted with, lies wa&s;te and u&s;ele&s;s, tho&s;e great bodies which are at &s;uch a di&s;tance from us &s;hould not be de&s;art and unpeopled, but rather that they &s;hould be furni&s;hed with Beings adapted to their re&s;pective &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Exi&s;tence is a ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e Beings only which are endowed with perception, and is in a manner thrown away upon dead matter, any further than as it is &s;ub|&s;ervient to Beings which are con&s;cious of their Exi&s;tence. Accordingly we find, from the bodies which lie under our ob&s;ervation, that matter is only made as the ba&s;is and &s;upport of animals, and that there is no more of the one, than what is nece&s;&s;ary for the Exi&s;tence of the o|ther.</P>
<P>Infinite Goodne&s;s is of &s;o communi|cative a nature, that it &s;eems to delight in the conferring of Exi&s;tence upon eve|ry degree of perceptive Being. As this is a &s;peculation, which I have often pur|&s;ued
<PB N="120" REF="148">
with great plea&s;ure to my &s;elf, I &s;hall enlarge farther upon it, by con&s;i|dering that part of the &s;cale of Beings which comes within our knowledge.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome living creatures which are rai&s;ed but ju&s;t above dead matter. To mention only that &s;pecies of &s;helfi&s;h, which are form'd in the fa&s;hion of a cone, that grow to the &s;urface of &s;everal Rocks, and immediately die upon their being &s;ever'd from the place where they grow. There are many other creatures but one remove from the&s;e, which have no other &s;en&s;e be&s;ides that of feeling and ta&s;te. Others have &s;till an additional one of hearing; others of &s;mell, and others of &s;ight. It is wonderful to ob&s;erve, by what a gradual progre&s;s the world of life advances through a prodigious variety of &s;pecies, before a creature is form'd that is compleat in all its &s;en&s;es; and even among the&s;e there is &s;uch a different degree of perfection in the &s;en&s;e which one animal enjoys beyond what appears in another, that though the &s;en&s;e in dif|ferent animals be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame common denomination, it &s;eems al|mo&s;t of a different nature. If after this we look into the &s;everal inward per|fections
<PB N="121" REF="149">
of cunning and &s;agacity, or what we generally call In&s;tinct, we find them ri&s;ing after the &s;ame manner, im|perceptibly one above another, and re|ceiving additional improvements accord|ing to the &s;pecies in which they are im|planted. This progre&s;s in Nature is &s;o very gradual, that the mo&s;t perfect of an inferior &s;pecies comes very near to the mo&s;t imperfect of that which is imme|diately above it.</P>
<P>The exuberant and overflowing good|ne&s;s of the Supreme Being, who&s;e mercy extends to all his works, is plainly &s;een, as I have before hinted, from his having made &s;o very little matter, at lea&s;t what falls within our knowledge, that does not &s;warm with life: Nor is his good|ne&s;s le&s;s &s;een in the diver&s;ity, than in the multitude of living creatures. Had he only made one &s;pecies of animals, none of the re&s;t would have enjoyed the hap|pine&s;s of exi&s;tence; he has, therefore, <HI>&s;pecified</HI> in his creation every degree of life, every capacity of Being. The whole cha&s;m in nature, from a plant to a man, is filled up with diver&s;e kinds of crea|tures, ri&s;ing one over another, by &s;uch a gentle and ea&s;ie a&s;cent, that the little
<PB N="122" REF="150">
tran&s;itions and deviations; from one &s;pe|cies to another, are almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible. This intermediate &s;pace is &s;o well hu&s;|banded and managed, that there is &s;carce a degree of perception which does not appear in &s;ome one part of the world of life. Is the goodne&s;s or wi&s;dom of the Divine Being, more manifested, in this his Proceeding?</P>
<P>There is a con&s;equence; be&s;ides tho&s;e I have already mentioned, which &s;eems very naturally deducible from the fore|going Con&s;iderations. If the &s;cale of Being ri&s;es by &s;uch a regular progre&s;s, &s;o high as man, we may by a parity of rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;e that it &s;till proceeds gra|dually through tho&s;e Beings which are of a &s;uperior nature to him, &s;ince there is an infinitely greater &s;pace and room for different degrees of perfection, be|tween the Supreme Being and man, than between man and the mo&s;t de&s;picable in|&s;ect. This, con&s;equence of &s;o great a variety of Beings which are &s;uperior to us, from that variety which is inferior to us, is made by Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> in a pa&s;&s;age which I &s;hall here &s;et down, after having premi&s;ed, that not with&s;tanding there is &s;uch infinite room between man and his
<PB N="123" REF="151">
Maker for the creative power to exert it &s;elf in, it is impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould ever be filled up, &s;ince there will be &s;till an infinite gap or di&s;tance between the highe&s;t created Being, and the Power which produced him.</P>
<P><HI>That there &s;hould be more</HI> &s;pecies <HI>of in|telligent creatures above us, than there are of &s;en&s;ible and material below us, is probable to me from hence; That in all the vi&s;ible corporeal world, we &s;ee no cha&s;ms, or no gaps. All quite down from us, the de&s;cent is by ea&s;y &s;teps, and a continued &s;eries of things, that in each remove differ very lit|tle one from the other. There are fi&s;hes that have wings, and are not &s;tranger to the airy region: and there are &s;ome birds, that are inhabitants of the water; who&s;e blood is cold as fi&s;hes, and their fle&s;h &s;o like in ta&s;te, that the &s;crupulous are allowed them on fi&s;h-days. There are animals &s;o near of kin both to birds and bea&s;ts, that they are in the middle between both: Amphibious animals link the terre&s;trial and aquatick together; Seals live at land and at &s;ea, and porpoi&s;es have the warm blood and entrails of a hog; not to mention what is confidently reported of mermaids or &s;ea-men. There are &s;ome brutes, that &s;eem to have as much
<PB N="124" REF="152">
knowledge and rea&s;on, as &s;ome that are called men; and the animal and vegetable king|doms are &s;o nearly join'd, that if you will take the lowe&s;t of one, and the highe&s;t of the other, there will &s;carce be perceived any great difference between them: and &s;o on till we come to the lowe&s;t and the mo&s;t inorganical parts of matter, we &s;hall find every where that the &s;everal</HI> Species <HI>are linked together, and differ but in almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible degrees. And when we con&s;ider the infinite power and wi&s;dom of the Maker, we have rea&s;on to think that it is &s;uitable to the magnificent harmony of the univer&s;e, and the great de|&s;ign and infinite goodne&s;s of the architect, that the</HI> Species <HI>of creatures &s;hould al&s;o, by gentle degrees, a&s;cend upward from us to|ward his infinite perfection, as we &s;ee they gradually de&s;cend from us downwards: which if it be probable, we have rea&s;on then to be per&s;uaded, that there are far more</HI> Species <HI>of creatures above us, than there are beneath; we being in degrees of perfecti|on much more remote from the infinite Being of God, than we are from the lowe&s;t &s;tate of Being, and that which approaches neare&s;t to nothing. And yet of all tho&s;e di&s;tinct</HI> Spe|cies, <HI>we have no clear di&s;tinct</HI> ideas.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="153">In this &s;y&s;tem of Being, there is no creature &s;o wonderful in its nature, and which &s;o much de&s;erves our particular attention, as man, who fills up the mid|dle &s;pace between the animal and intel|lectual nature, the vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible world, and is that link in the chain of Beings, which has been often termed the <HI>nexus utriu&s;que mundi.</HI> So that he who in one re&s;pect is a&s;&s;ociated with Angels and Arch-angels, may look upon a Be|ing of infinite perfection as his father, and the highe&s;t order of &s;pirits as his brethren, may in another re&s;pect &s;ay to <HI>corruption, thou art my father, and to the worm, thou art my mother and my &s;i&s;ter.</HI> </P>

<P>THOSE who were &s;kilful in anato|my among the ancients, concluded from the outward and inward make of an human body, that it was the work of a Being tran&s;cendently wi&s;e and power|ful. As the world grew more enlightened in this art, their di&s;coveries gave them fre&s;h opportunities of admiring the con|duct of Providence in the formation of an
<PB N="126" REF="154">
human body. <HI>Galen</HI> was converted by his di&s;&s;ections, and could not but own a Su|preme Being upon a &s;urvey of this his handy-work. There were, indeed, many parts of which the old Anatomi&s;ts did not know the certain u&s;e; but as they &s;aw that mo&s;t of tho&s;e which they examined were adapted with admirable art to their &s;e|veral functions, they did not que&s;tion but tho&s;e, who&s;e u&s;es they could not determine, were contrived with the &s;ame wi&s;dom for re&s;pective ends and purpo&s;es. Since the circulation of the blood has been found out, and many other great di&s;coveries have been made by our mo|dern Anatomi&s;ts, we &s;ee new wonders in the human frame, and di&s;cern &s;everal im|portant u&s;es for tho&s;e parts, which u&s;es the ancients knew nothing of. In &s;hort, the body of man is &s;uch a &s;ubject as &s;tands the utmo&s;t te&s;t of examination. Tho' it appears formed with the nice&s;t wi&s;dom, upon the mo&s;t &s;uperficial &s;urvey of it, it &s;till mends upon the &s;earch, and produces our &s;urprize and amazement in proportion as we pry into it. What I have here &s;aid of an human body, may be applied to the body of every animal which has been the &s;ubject of anatomical ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="155">The body of an animal is an object ade|quate to our Sen&s;es. It is a particular &s;y&s;tem of providence, that lies in a nar|row compa&s;s. The eye is able to com|mand it, and by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive enquiries can &s;earch into all its parts. Could the body of the whole earth, or indeed the whole univer&s;e, be thus &s;ubmitted to the exami|nation of our &s;en&s;es, were it not too big and di&s;proportioned for our enquiries, too unwiedly for the management of the eye and hand, there is no que&s;tion but it would appear to us as curious and well-contrived a frame as that of an human body. We &s;hould &s;ee the &s;ame conca|tenation and &s;ub&s;erviency, the &s;ame ne|ce&s;&s;ity and u&s;efulne&s;s, the &s;ame beauty and harmony in all and every of its parts, as what we di&s;cover in the body of every &s;ingle animal.</P>
<P>The more extended our rea&s;on is, and the more able to grapple with immen&s;e objects, the greater &s;till are tho&s;e di&s;co|veries which it makes of wi&s;dom and providence in the work of the creation. A Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> who &s;tands up as the miracle of the pre&s;ent age, can look through a whole planetary &s;y&s;tem; con|&s;ider it in its weight, number, and mea|&s;ure;
<PB N="128" REF="156">
and draw from it as many demon|&s;trations of infinite power and wi&s;dom, as a more confined under&s;tanding is able to deduce from the &s;y&s;tem of an human body.</P>
<P>But to return to our &s;peculations on anatomy. I &s;hall here con&s;ider the fa|brick and texture of the bodies of ani|mals in one particular view; which, in my opinion, &s;hews the hand of a think|ing and all-wi&s;e Being in their formati|on, with the evidence of a thou&s;and de|mon&s;trations. I think we may lay this down as an inconte&s;ted principle, that chance never acts in a perpetual unifor|mity and con&s;i&s;tence with it &s;elf. If one &s;hould always fling the &s;ame number with ten thou&s;and dice, or &s;ee every throw ju&s;t five times le&s;s, or five times more in number than the throw which immediately preceded it, who would not imagine there is &s;ome invi&s;ible power which directs the ca&s;t? This is the pro|ceeding which we find in the operations of nature. Every kind of animal is di|ver&s;ified by different magnitudes, each of which gives ri&s;e to a different &s;pecies. Let a man trace the dog or lion-kind, and he will ob&s;erve how many of the
<PB N="129" REF="157">
works of nature are publi&s;hed, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, in a variety of editi|ons. If we look into the reptile world, or into tho&s;e different kinds of animals that fill the element of water, we meet with the &s;ame repetitions among &s;everal &s;pecies, that differ very little from one another, but in &s;ize and bulk. You find the &s;ame creature that is drawn at large, copied out in &s;everal proportions, and ending in miniature. It would be tedious to produce in&s;tances of this regular con|duct in Providence, as it would be &s;u|perfluous to tho&s;e who are ver&s;ed in the natural hi&s;tory of animals. The magni|ficent harmony of the univer&s;e is &s;uch, that we may ob&s;erve innumerable <HI>divi|&s;ions</HI> running upon the &s;ame <HI>ground.</HI> I might al&s;o extend this &s;peculation to the dead parts of nature, in which we may find matter di&s;po&s;ed into many <HI>&s;imilar</HI> &s;y&s;tems, as well in our &s;urvey of &s;tars and planets, as of &s;tones, vegetables, and o|ther &s;ublunary parts of the creation. In a word, Providence has &s;hewn the rich|ne&s;s of its goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom, not on|ly in the production of many original &s;pecies, but in the multiplicity of De|&s;cants which it has made on every origi|nal &s;pecies in particular.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="158">But to pur&s;ue his thought &s;till farther: Every living creature, con&s;idered in it &s;elf, has many very complicated parts, that are exact copies of &s;ome other parts which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and which are com|plicated in the &s;ame manner. One <HI>eye</HI> would have been &s;ufficient for the &s;ub&s;i|&s;tence and pre&s;ervation of an animal; but, in order to better his condition, we &s;ee another placed with a mathematical ex|actne&s;s in the &s;ame mo&s;t advantageous &s;i|tuation, and in every particular of the &s;ame &s;ize and texture. Is it po&s;&s;ible for chance to be thus delicate and uniform in her operations? Should a million of dice turn up twice together the &s;ame number, the wonder would be nothing in compa|ri&s;on with this. But when we &s;ee this &s;imilitude and re&s;emblance in the arm, the hand, the fingers; when we &s;ee one half of the body entirely corre&s;pond with the other in all tho&s;e minute &s;trokes, without which a man might have very well &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; nay, when we often &s;ee a &s;ingle part repeated an hundred times in the &s;ame body, notwith&s;tanding it con|&s;i&s;ts of the mo&s;t intricate weaving of numberle&s;s fibres, and the&s;e parts differ|ing &s;till in magnitude, as the convenience

of their particular &s;ituation requires; &s;ure a man mu&s;t have a &s;trange ca&s;t of under&s;tanding, who does not di&s;cover the Finger of God in &s;o wonderful a work. The&s;e duplicates in tho&s;e parts of the body, without which a man might have very well &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, tho' not &s;o well as with them, are a plain demon&s;tration of an all-wi&s;e contriver; as tho&s;e more numerous copyings, which are found a|mong the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;ame body, are evident demon&s;trations that they could not be the work of chance. This argu|ment receives additional &s;trength, if we apply it to every animal and in&s;ect with|in our knowledge, as well as to tho&s;e numberle&s;s living creatures that are ob|jects too minute for a human eye: and if we con&s;ider how the &s;everal &s;pecies in this whole world of life re&s;emble one an|other in very many particulars, &s;o far as is convenient for their re&s;pective &s;tates of exi&s;tence; it is much more probable that an hundred million of dice &s;hould be ca|&s;ually thrown a hundred million of times in the &s;ame number, than that the body of any &s;ingle animal &s;hould be produced by the fortuitous concour&s;e of matter. And that the like chance &s;hould ari&s;e in

innumerable in&s;tances, requires a degree of credulity that is not under the dire|ction of common &s;en&s;e.

<P>There are many more demon&s;trations of a Supreme Being, and of his tran&s;cen|dent wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s in the formation of the body of a living crea|ture, for which I refer my reader to o|ther writings, particularly to the &s;ixth book of the Poem, entitled <HI>Creation,</HI> where the anatomy of the human body is de&s;cribed with great per&s;picuity and elegance.

<P>I Had this morning a very valuable and kind pre&s;ent &s;ent me, of a tran&s;|lated work of a mo&s;t excellent foreign writer, who makes a very con&s;iderable figure in the learned and chri&s;tian world. It is entitled, <HI>A demon&s;tration of the Exi|&s;tence, Wi&s;dom, and Omnipotence of God,</HI> drawn from the knowledge of nature, particularly of man, and fitted to the meane&s;t capacity, by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> author of <HI>Telemachus,</HI> and tran&s;|lated from the <HI>French</HI> by the &s;ame hand that <HI>Engli&s;hed</HI> that excellent piece.

His talents and parts are a very great good to the world, and it is a plea|&s;ing thing to behold the polite arts &s;ub|servient to religion, and recommending it from its natural beauty.

<P>I Think I have &s;omewhere read, in the writings of one whom I take to be a friend of yours, a &s;aying which &s;truck me very much, and as I remem|ber it was to this purpo&s;e: <HI>The Exi|&s;tence of a God is &s;o far from being a thing that wants to be proved, that I think it the only thing of which we are certain.</HI> This is a &s;prightly and ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ion; however, I dare &s;ay, you will not be di&s;plea&s;ed that I put you in mind of &s;aying &s;omething on the De|mon&s;tration of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray.</HI> A man of his talents views all things in a light different from that in which ordinary men &s;ee them, and the devout di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;oul turns all tho&s;e talents to the improvement of the plea|&s;ures of a good life. His &s;tyle cloaths philo&s;ophy in a dre&s;s almo&s;t poetick, and his readers enjoy in full perfection the advantage, while they are reading him, of being what he is. The plea|&s;ing repre&s;entation of the animal pow|ers in the beginning of his work, and

his con&s;ideration of the nature of man with the addition of rea&s;on, in the &s;ub|&s;equent di&s;cour&s;e, impre&s;&s;es upon the mind a &s;trong &s;atisfaction in it &s;elf, and gratitude towards him who be&s;towed that &s;uperiority over the brute world. The&s;e thoughts had &s;uch an effect up|on the author him&s;elf, that he has end|ed his di&s;cour&s;e with a prayer. This adoration has a &s;ublimity in it befitting his character, and the emotions of his heart flow from wi&s;dom and know|ledge. I thought it would be proper for a <HI>Saturday</HI>'s paper, and have tran&s;|lated it, to make you a pre&s;ent of it. I have not, as the tran&s;lator was obli|ged to do, confined my &s;elf to an exact ver&s;ion from the original, but have en|deavoured to expre&s;s the &s;pirit of it, by taking the liberty to render his thoughts in &s;uch a way as I &s;hould I have ut|tered them if they had been my own. It has been ob&s;erved, that the private letters of great men are the be&s;t pi|ctures of their &s;ouls, but certainly their private devotions would be &s;till more in&s;tructive, and I know not why they &s;hould not be as curious and entertain|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="164">
If you in&s;ert this prayer, I know not but I may &s;end you, for another occa&s;ion, one u&s;ed by a very great wit of the la&s;t age, which has allu&s;ions to the errors of a very wild life, and I believe you will think is written with an uncommon &s;pirit. The per&s;on whom I mean was an excellent writer, and the publication of this prayer of his may be, perhaps, &s;ome kind of anti|dote again&s;t the infection in his other writings. But this &s;upplication of the Bi&s;hop has in it a more happy and un|troubled &s;pirit; it is (if that is not &s;ay|ing &s;omething too fond) the wor&s;hip of an Angel concerned for tho&s;e who had fallen, but him&s;elf &s;till in the &s;tate of glory and innocence. The book ends with an act of devotion, to this effect:</P>
<P>O my God, if the greater number of mankind do not di&s;cover thee in that glorious &s;how of nature which thou ha&s;t placed before our eyes, it is not becau&s;e thou art far from every one of us; thou art pre&s;ent to us more than any one object which we touch with our hands; but our &s;en&s;es, and the pa&s;&s;ions which they produce in us, turn

Thou &s;hine&s;t in all thy works, but art not regarded by heedle&s;s and unthinking man. The whole creation talks aloud of thee, and eccho's with the repetitions of thy holy name. But &s;uch is our in&s;en&s;ibility, that we are deaf to the great and univer&s;al voice of nature. Thou art every where about us, and within us; but we wander from our &s;elves, become &s;trangers to our own &s;ouls, and do not apprehend thy pre&s;ence.

Such vain empty objects that are only the &s;hadows of Being, are proportioned to our low and groveling thoughts. That beauty which thou ha&s;t poured out on thy creation, is as a veil which hides thee from our eyes. As thou art a Being too pure and exalted to pa&s;s through our &s;en&s;es, thou art not regarded by men, who have deba&s;ed their nature, and have made them&s;elves like the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h.

<P>IT is very rea&s;onable to believe, that part of the plea&s;ure which happy minds &s;hall enjoy in a future &s;tate, will a|ri&s;e from an enlarged contemplation of the Divine Wi&s;dom in the government of the world, and a di&s;covery of the &s;e|cret and amazing &s;teps of Providence, from the beginning to the end of time. Nothing &s;eems to be an entertainment more adapted to the nature of man, if we con&s;ider that curio&s;ity is one of the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting appetites im|planted in us, and that admiration is one of our mo&s;t plea&s;ing pa&s;&s;ions; and what a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of enjoyments will be afforded to both the&s;e, in a &s;cene &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">arge and various as &s;hall then be laid

<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible, on the contrary, that part of the puni&s;hment of &s;uch as are excluded from bli&s;s, may con&s;i&s;t not only in their being denied this privilege, but in having their appetites at the &s;ame time va&s;tly encrea&s;ed, without any &s;atis|faction afforded to them. In the&s;e, the vain pur&s;uit of knowledge &s;hall, perhaps, add to their infelicity, and bewilder them into labyrinths of error, darkne&s;s, di&s;traction and uncertainty of every thing but their own evil &s;tate. <HI>Milton</HI> has thus repre|&s;ented the fallen Angels rea&s;oning to|gether in a kind of re&s;pite from their torments, and creating to them&s;elves a new di&s;quiet amid&s;t their very amu&s;e|ments; he could not properly have de|&s;cribed the &s;ports of condemned Spirits, without that ca&s;t of horror and melan|choly he has &s;o judiciou&s;ly mingled with them.</P>

<P><PB N="143" REF="171">In our pre&s;ent condition, which is a middle &s;tate, our minds are, as it were, chequered with truth and fal&s;hood; and as our faculties are narrow and our views imperfect, it is impo&s;&s;ible but our curio|&s;ity mu&s;t meet with many repul&s;es. The bu&s;ine&s;s of mankind in this life being ra|ther to act than to know, their portion of knowledge is dealt to them accord|ingly.</P>
<P>From hence it is, that the rea&s;on of the Inqui&s;itive has &s;o long been exerci|&s;ed with difficulties, in accounting for the promi&s;cuous di&s;tribution of good and evil to the virtuous and the wicked in this world. From hence come all tho&s;e pathetical complaints of &s;o many tragi|cal events, which happen to the wi&s;e and the good; and of &s;uch &s;urprizing pro&s;perity, which is often the reward of the guilty and the fooli&s;h; that rea&s;on is &s;ometimes puzzled, and at a lo&s;s what to pronounce upon &s;o my&s;terious a di&s;pen|&s;ation.</P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> expre&s;&s;es his abhorrence of &s;ome fables of the Poets, which &s;eem to reflect on the Gods as the authors of inju&s;tice; and lays it down as a principle, that
<PB N="144" REF="172">
whatever is permitted to befal a ju&s;t man, whether poverty, &s;ickne&s;s, or any of tho&s;e things which &s;eem to be evils, &s;hall either in life or death conduce to his good. My reader will ob&s;erve how a|greeable this maxim is to what we find delivered by a greater authority. <HI>Seneca</HI> has written a di&s;cour&s;e purpo&s;ely on this &s;ubject, in which he takes pains, after the doctrine of the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> to &s;hew, that adver&s;ity is not in it&s;elf an evil; and mentions a noble &s;aying of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> That <HI>nothing would be more unhappy than a man who had never known affliction.</HI> He compares pro&s;perity to the indulgence of a fond mother to a child, which often proves his ruin; but the affection of the Divine Being to that of a wi&s;e father, who would have his &s;ons exerci&s;ed with labour, di&s;appointment, and pain, that they may gather &s;trength, and improve their fortitude. On this occa&s;ion the Philo&s;opher ri&s;es into that celebrated &s;en|timent, that there is not on earth a &s;pe|ctacle more worthy the regard of a Cre|ator intent on his works, than a brave man &s;uperior to his &s;ufferings; to which he adds, that it mu&s;t be a plea&s;ure to <HI>Ju|piter</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="173">
him&s;elf to look down from heaven, and &s;ee <HI>Cato</HI> amid&s;t the ruins of his coun|try pre&s;erving his integrity</P>
<P>This thought will appear yet more rea&s;onable, if we con&s;ider human life as a &s;tate of probation, and adver&s;ity as the po&s;t of honour in it, a&s;&s;igned often to the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;elect Spirits.</P>
<P>But what I would chiefly in&s;i&s;t on here, is, that we are not at pre&s;ent in a proper &s;ituation to judge of the coun|&s;els by which Providence acts, &s;ince but little arrives at our knowledge, and even that little we di&s;cern imperfectly; or ac|cording to the elegant figure in Holy Writ, <HI>We &s;ee but in part, and as in a gla&s;s darkly.</HI> It is to be con&s;idered, that Pro|vidence in its oeconomy regards the whole &s;y&s;tem of time and things together, &s;o that we cannot di&s;cover the beautiful connections between incidents which lie widely &s;eparated in time, and by lo&s;ing &s;o many links of the chain, our rea&s;on|ings become broken and imperfect. Thus tho&s;e parts in the moral world which have not an ab&s;olute, may yet have a relative beauty, in re&s;pect of &s;ome other parts concealed from us, but open to his eye before whom <HI>Pa&s;t, Pre&s;ent,</HI> and <HI>To
<PB N="146" REF="174">
come,</HI> are &s;et together in one point of view: and tho&s;e events, the permi&s;&s;ion of which &s;eems now to accu&s;e his good|ne&s;s, may in the con&s;ummation of things both magnify his goodne&s;s, and exalt his wi&s;dom. And this is enough to check our pre&s;umption, &s;ince it is in vain to apply our mea&s;ures of regularity to mat|ters of which we know neither the an|tecedents nor the con&s;equents, the be|ginning nor the end.</P>
<P>I &s;hall relieve my readers from this ab&s;tracted thought, by relating here a <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> tradition concerning <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> which &s;eems to be a kind of parable, illu&s;tra|ting what I have la&s;t mentioned. That great Prophet, it is &s;aid, was called up by a voice from heaven to the top of a mountain; where, in a conference with the Supreme Being, he was permitted to propo&s;e to him &s;ome que&s;tions concern|ing his admini&s;tration of the univer&s;e. In the mid&s;t of this Divine Colloquy he was commanded to look down on the plain below. At the foot of the moun|tain there i&s;&s;ued out a clear &s;pring of water, at which a &s;oldier alighted from his hor&s;e to drink. He was no &s;ooner gone than a little boy came to the &s;ame
<PB N="147" REF="175">
place, and finding a pur&s;e of gold which the Soldier had dropped, took it up and went away with it. Immediately after this came an infirm old man, weary with age and travelling, and having quenched his thir&s;t, &s;at down to re&s;t him&s;elf by the &s;ide of the &s;pring. The &s;oldier mi&s;&s;ing his pur&s;e returns to &s;earch for it, and demands it of the old man, who affirms he had not &s;een it, and ap|peals to heaven in witne&s;s of his inno|cence. The Soldier, not believing his prote&s;tation, kills him. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> fell on his face with horror and amazement, when the Divine Voice thus prevented his ex|po&s;tulation;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">Be not &s;urprized, <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> nor ask why the Judge of the whole earth has &s;uffer'd this thing to come to pa&s;s: The child is the occa&s;ion that the blood of the old man is &s;pilt; but know, that the old man whom thou &s;aw'&s;t, was the murderer of that child's father.</Q></P>

<P>THE famous <HI>Gratian,</HI> in his little book wherein he lays down max|ims for a man's advancing him&s;elf at court, advi&s;es his reader to a&s;&s;ociate him|&s;elf with the fortunate, and to &s;hun the company of the unfortunate; which not|with&s;tanding the ba&s;ene&s;s of the precept to an hone&s;t mind, may have &s;omething u&s;eful in it for tho&s;e who pu&s;h their in|tere&s;t in the world. It is certain a great part of what we call good or ill fortune, ri&s;es out of right or wrong mea&s;ures nd &s;chemes of life. When I hear a man complain of his being unfortunate in all his undertakings, I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect him for a very weak man in his affairs. In conformity with this way of thinking, Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> u&s;ed to &s;ay, that un|fortunate and imprudent were but two words for the &s;ame thing. As the Car|dinal him&s;elf had a great &s;hare both of prudence and good-fortune, his famous antagoni&s;t, the Count <HI>d'Olivarez,</HI> was di&s;graced at the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> be|cau&s;e it was alledged again&s;t him that he

had never any &s;ucce&s;s in his undertakings. This, &s;ays an eminent author, was <HI>indi|rectly</HI> accu&s;ing him of Imprudence.</P>
<P><HI>Cicero</HI> recommended <HI>Pompey</HI> to the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> for their General upon three ac|counts, as he was a man of courage, con|duct, and good-fortune. It was, perhaps, for the rea&s;on above mentioned, namely, that a &s;eries of good-fortune &s;uppo&s;es a prudent management in the per&s;on whom it befalls, that not only <HI>Sylla</HI> the Dicta|tor, but &s;everal of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, as is &s;till to be &s;een upon their medals, among their other titles, gave them|&s;elves that of <HI>Felix</HI> or fortunate. The Heathens, indeed, &s;eem to have valued a man more for his good-fortune than for any other quality, which I think is very natural for tho&s;e who have not a &s;trong belief of another world. For how can I conceive a man crowned with ma|ny di&s;tingui&s;hing ble&s;&s;ings, that has not &s;ome extraordinary fund of merit and perfection in him, which lies open to the Supreme Eye, tho' perhaps it is not di&s;|covered by my ob&s;ervation? What is the rea&s;on <HI>Homer</HI>'s and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s heroes do not form a re&s;olution, or &s;trike a blow, with|out the conduct and direction of &s;ome

Deity? Doubtle&s;s, becau&s;e the Poets e&s;teemed it the greate&s;t honour to be fa|voured by the Gods, and thought the be&s;t way of prai&s;ing a man was to re|count tho&s;e favours which naturally im|plied an extraordinary merit in the per|&s;on on whom they de&s;cended.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who believe a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments act very ab&s;urd|ly, if they form their opinions of a man's merit from his &s;ucce&s;&s;es. But certainly, if I thought the whole circle of our Be|ing was concluded between our births and deaths, I &s;hould think a man's good-fortune the mea&s;ure and &s;tandard of his real merit, &s;ince Providence would have no opportunity of rewarding his virtue and perfections, but in the pre&s;ent life. A virtuous unbeliever, who lies under the pre&s;&s;ure of misfortunes, has rea&s;on to cry out, as they &s;ay <HI>Brutus</HI> did a little before his death, <HI>O Virtue, I have wor|&s;hipped thee as a &s;ub&s;tantial good, but I find thou art an empty name.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to our fir&s;t point: Tho' prudence does undoubtedly in a great mea&s;ure produce our good or ill-fortune in the world, it is certain there are ma|ny unfore&s;een accidents and occurrences,
<PB N="151" REF="179">
which very often pervert the fine&s;t &s;chemes that can be laid by human wi&s;|dom. The race is not always to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong. No|thing le&s;s than Infinite Wi&s;dom can have an ab&s;olute command over Fortune; the highe&s;t degree of it which man can po&s;|&s;e&s;s, is by no means equal to fortuitous events, and to &s;uch contingencies as may ri&s;e in the pro&s;ecution of our affairs. Nay, it very often happens, that prudence, which has always in it a great mixture of caution, hinders a man from being &s;o fortunate as he might po&s;&s;ibly have been without it. A per&s;on who only aims at what is likely to &s;ucceed, and follows clo&s;ely the dictates of humane prudence, never meets with tho&s;e great and unfore|&s;een &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which are often the effect of a &s;anguine temper, or a more happy ra&s;hne&s;s; and this perhaps may be the rea&s;on, that according to the common ob&s;ervation, Fortune, like other females, delights rather in favouring the young than the old.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, &s;ince man is &s;o &s;hort-&s;ighted a creature, and the accidents which may happen to him &s;o various, I cannot but be of Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI>'s opinion

<P>It is a great pre&s;umption to a&s;cribe our &s;ucce&s;&s;es to our own management, and not to e&s;teem our &s;elves upon any ble&s;&s;ing, rather as it is the bounty of heaven, than the acqui&s;ition of our own prudence. I am very well plea&s;ed with a Medal which was &s;truck by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> a little after the defeat of the invincible Armada, to perpetuate the memory of that extraordinary event. It is well known how the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and others, who were the enemies of that great Prince&s;s, to derogate from her glory, a&s;cribed the ruin of their fleet rather to the violence of &s;torms and tem|pe&s;ts, than to the bravery of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in&s;tead of looking up|on this as a diminution of her honour, valued her&s;elf upon &s;uch a &s;ignal favour of Providence, and accordingly in the rever&s;e of the Medal above mentioned has repre&s;ented a fleet beaten by a tempe&s;t, and falling foul upon one another, with
<PB N="153" REF="181">
that religious in&s;cription, <HI>Afflavit deus &amp; di&s;&s;ipantur. He blew with his wind, and they were &s;cattered.</HI></P>
<P>It is remarked of a famous <HI>Grecian</HI> Ge|neral, who&s;e name I cannot at pre&s;ent recollect, and who had been a particular favourite of Fortune, that upon recount|ing his victories among his friends, he added at the end of &s;everal great actions, <HI>And in this Fortune had no &s;hare.</HI> After which it is ob&s;erved in hi&s;tory, that he never pro&s;pered in any thing he under|took.</P>
<P>As arrogance, and a conceitedne&s;s of our own abilities, are very &s;hocking and of|fen&s;ive to men of &s;en&s;e and virtue, we may be &s;ure they are highly di&s;plea&s;ing to that Being who delights in an humble mind, and by &s;everal of his di&s;pen&s;ations &s;eems purpo&s;ely to &s;how us, that our own &s;chemes or prudence have no &s;hare in our advancements.</P>
<P>Since on this &s;ubject I have already ad|mitted &s;everal quotations which have oc|curred to my memory upon writing this paper, I will conclude it with a little <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> Fable. A drop of water fell out of a cloud into the &s;ea, and finding it &s;elf lo&s;t in &s;uch an immen&s;ity of fluid matter,

broke out into the following reflection:

It &s;o happened that an Oy&s;ter, which lay in the neigh|bourhood of this Drop, chanced to gape and &s;wallow it up in the mid&s;t of this its humble Soliloquy. The Drop, &s;ays the fable, lay a great while hardening in the &s;hell, 'till by degrees it was ripened into a pearl, which falling into the hands of a Diver, after a long &s;eries of adventures, is at pre&s;ent that famous pearl which is fixed on the top of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> dia|dem.</P>

<P>MAN, con&s;idered in him&s;elf, is a ve|ry helple&s;s and a very wretched Being. He is &s;ubject every moment to the greate&s;t calamities and misfortunes. He is be&s;et with dangers on all &s;ides, and may become unhappy by numberle&s;s ca|&s;ualties,
<PB N="155" REF="183">
which he could not fore&s;ee, nor have prevented, had he fore&s;een them.</P>
<P>It is our comfort, while we are ob|noxious to &s;o many accidents, that we are under the care of one who directs contingencies, and has in his hands the management of every thing that is capa|ble of annoying or offending us; who knows the a&s;&s;i&s;tance we &s;tand in need of, and is always ready to be&s;tow it on tho&s;e who ask it of him.</P>
<P>The natural homage, which &s;uch a creature bears to &s;o infinitely wi&s;e and good a Being, is a firm reliance on him for the ble&s;&s;ings and conveniencies of life, and an habitual tru&s;t in him for de|liverance out of all &s;uch dangers and difficulties as may befall us.</P>
<P>The Man, who always lives in this di&s;po&s;ition of mind, has not the &s;ame dark and melancholy views of human nature, as he who con&s;iders him&s;elf ab|&s;tractedly from this relation to the Su|preme Being. At the &s;ame time that he reflects upon his own weakne&s;s and im|perfection, he comforts him&s;elf with the contemplation of tho&s;e divine attributes, which are employed for his &s;afety and his welfare. He finds his want of fore|&s;ight
<PB N="156" REF="184">
made up by the Omni&s;cience of him who is his &s;upport. He is not &s;en&s;i|ble of his own want of &s;trength, when he knows that his Helper is Almighty. In &s;hort, the per&s;on who has a firm tru&s;t on the Supreme Being is Powerful in <HI>his</HI> Power, Wi&s;e by <HI>his</HI> Wi&s;dom, Happy by <HI>his</HI> Happine&s;s. He reaps the benefit of every Divine Attribute, and lo&s;es his own in&s;ufficiency in the fullne&s;s of infinite perfection.</P>
<P>To make our lives more ea&s;ie to us, we are commanded to put our tru&s;t in him, who is thus able to relieve and &s;uc|cour us; The Divine Goodne&s;s having made &s;uch a reliance a duty, notwith|&s;tanding we &s;hould have been mi&s;erable had it been forbidden us.</P>
<P>Among &s;everal motives, which might be made u&s;e of to recommend this duty to us, I &s;hall only take notice of tho&s;e that follow.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t is, that we are promi&s;ed, He will not fail tho&s;e who put their tru&s;t in him.</P>
<P>But without con&s;idering the &s;uperna|tural ble&s;&s;ing which accompanies this duty, we may ob&s;erve that it has a na|tural tendency to its own reward, or in
<PB N="157" REF="185">
other words, that this firm tru&s;t and con|fidence in the great Di&s;po&s;er of all things, contributes very much to the getting clear of any affliction, or to the bearing it manfully. A per&s;on who believes he has his &s;uccour at hand, and that he acts in &s;ight of his friend, often exerts him|&s;elf beyond his abilities, and does won|ders that are not to be matched by one who is not animated with &s;uch a confi|dence of &s;ucce&s;s. I could produce in|&s;tances from hi&s;tory, of Generals, who out of a belief that they were under the protection of &s;ome invi&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tant, did not only encourage their Soldiers to do their utmo&s;t, but have acted them&s;elves beyond what they would have done, had they not been in&s;pired by &s;uch a be|lief. I might in the &s;ame manner &s;hew how &s;uch a tru&s;t in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an Almighty Being, naturally produces pa|tience, hope, chearfulne&s;s, and all other di&s;po&s;itions of mind that alleviate tho&s;e calamities which we are not able to re|move.</P>
<P>The practice of this virtue admini&s;ters great comfort to the mind of man in times of poverty and affliction, but mo&s;t of all in the hour of death. When the
<PB N="158" REF="186">
&s;oul is hovering in the la&s;t moments of its &s;eparation, when it is ju&s;t entring on another &s;tate of Exi&s;tence, to conver&s;e with &s;cenes, and objects, and compani|ons that are altogether new, what can &s;upport her under &s;uch tremblings of thought, &s;uch fear, &s;uch anxiety, &s;uch apprehen&s;ions, but the ca&s;ting of all her cares upon him who fir&s;t gave her Being, who has conducted her through one &s;tage of it, and will be always with her to guide and comfort her in her progre&s;s through eternity?</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> has very beautifully repre&s;ent|ed this &s;teady reliance on God Almighty in his twenty third P&s;alm, which is a kind of <HI>Pa&s;toral</HI> hymn, and filled with tho&s;e allu&s;ions which are u&s;ual in that kind of writing.

<P>IT is of the la&s;t importance to &s;ea&s;on the pa&s;&s;ions of a child with Devo|tion, which &s;eldom dies in a mind that has received an early tincture of it. Though it may &s;eem extingui&s;hed for a while by the cares of the world, the heats of youth, or the allurements of vice, it generally breaks out and di&s;|covers it &s;elf again as &s;oon as di&s;cre|tion, con&s;ideration, age, or misfortunes have brought the man to him&s;elf. The fire may be covered and overlaid, but cannot be entirely quenched and &s;mo|thered.</P>
<P>A &s;tate of temperance, &s;obriety, and ju&s;tice, without devotion, is a cold, life|le&s;s,
<PB N="161" REF="189">
in&s;ipid condition of virtue; and is rather to be &s;tyled Philo&s;ophy than Reli|gion. Devotion opens the mind to great conceptions, and fills it with more &s;ub|lime ideas than any that are to be met with in the mo&s;t exalted &s;cience; and at the &s;ame time warms and agitates the Soul more than &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved by &s;ome writers, that man is more di&s;tingui&s;hed from the animal world by Devotion than by Rea|&s;on, as &s;everal brute creatures di&s;cover in their actions &s;omething like a faint glimmering of rea&s;on, though they be|tray in no &s;ingle circum&s;tance of their behaviour any thing that bears the lea&s;t affinity to devotion. It is certain, the propen&s;ity of the mind to religious wor|&s;hip, the natural tendency of the &s;oul to fly to &s;ome &s;uperior Being for &s;uccour in dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, the gratitude to an invi&s;ible Superintendent which ari|&s;es in us upon receiving any extraordina|ry and unexpected good fortune, the acts of love and admiration with which the thoughts of men are &s;o wonderfully tran&s;|ported in meditating upon the Divine Perfections, and the univer&s;al concur|rence of all the nations under heaven in
<PB N="162" REF="190">
the great article of adoration, plainly &s;hew that devotion or religious wor&s;hip mu&s;t be the effect of a tradition from &s;ome fir&s;t founder of mankind, or that it is conformable to the natural light of rea&s;on, or that it proceeds from an in|&s;tinct implanted in the &s;oul it &s;elf. For my part, I look upon all the&s;e to be the concurrent cau&s;es, but which ever of them &s;hall be a&s;&s;igned as the principle of Divine Wor&s;hip, it manife&s;tly points to a Supreme Being as the fir&s;t author of it.</P>
<P>I may take &s;ome other opportunity of con&s;idering tho&s;e particular forms and methods of devotion which are taught us by Chri&s;tianity; but &s;hall here ob&s;erve into what errors even this Divine Prin|ciple may &s;ometimes lead us, when it is not moderated by that right rea&s;on which was given us as the guide of all our actions.</P>
<P>The two great errors into which a mi&s;taken devotion may betray us, are Enthu&s;ia&s;m and Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>There is not a more melancholy ob|ject than a man who has his head turned with religious enthu&s;ia&s;m. A per&s;on that is crazed, tho' with pride or malice, is
<PB N="163" REF="191">
a &s;ight very mortifying to human na|ture; but when the di&s;temper ari&s;es from any indi&s;creet fervors of devotion, or too inten&s;e an application of the mind to its mi&s;taken duties, it de&s;erves our compa&s;|&s;ion in a more particular manner. We may however learn this le&s;&s;on from it, that &s;ince devotion it &s;elf (which one would be apt to think could not be too warm) may di&s;order the mind, unle&s;s its heats are tempered with caution and pru|dence, we &s;hould be particularly careful to keep our rea&s;on as cool as po&s;&s;ible, and to guard our &s;elves in all parts of life again&s;t the influence of pa&s;&s;ion, imagina|tion, and con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Devotion, when it does not lie under the check of rea&s;on, is very apt to de|generate into Enthu&s;ia&s;m. When the mind finds her&s;elf very much enflamed with her devotions, &s;he is too much in|clined to think they are not of her own kindling, but blown up with &s;omething Divine within her. If &s;he indulges this thought too far, and humours the grow|ing pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he at la&s;t flings her&s;elf into imaginary raptures and ec&s;ta&s;ies; and when once &s;he fancies her&s;elf under the influence of a Divine Impul&s;e, it is no
<PB N="164" REF="192">
wonder if &s;he &s;lights human ordinances, and refu&s;es to comply with any e&s;ta|bli&s;hed form of religion, as thinking her &s;elf directed by a much &s;uperior guide.</P>
<P>As Enthu&s;ia&s;m is a kind of exce&s;s in devotion, Super&s;tition is the exce&s;s not only of devotion, but of religion in ge|neral; according to an old Heathen &s;ay|ing, quoted by <HI>Aulus Gellius, Religentem e&s;&s;e oportet; Religio&s;um nefas</HI>; A man &s;hould be religious, not &s;uper&s;titious; for as the author tells us, <HI>Nigidius</HI> ob|&s;erved upon this pa&s;&s;age, that the <HI>Latin</HI> words which terminate in <HI>o&s;us</HI> generally imply vitious characters, and the having of any quality to an exce&s;s.</P>
<P>An Enthu&s;ia&s;t in religion is like an ob|&s;tinate clown, a &s;uper&s;titious man like an in&s;ipid courtier. Enthu&s;ia&s;m has &s;ome|thing in it of madne&s;s, Super&s;tition of folly. Mo&s;t of the Sects that fall &s;hort of the Church of <HI>England</HI> have in them &s;trong tinctures of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, as the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Religion is one huge over-grown body of childi&s;h and idle Su|per&s;titions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Church &s;eems indeed irrecoverably lo&s;t in this particu|lar. If an ab&s;urd dre&s;s or behaviour be
<PB N="165" REF="193">
introduced in the world, it will &s;oon be found out and di&s;carded: On the con|trary, a habit or ceremony, tho' never &s;o ridiculous, which has taken &s;anctuary in the Church, &s;ticks in it for ever. A <HI>Gothic</HI> Bi&s;hop, perhaps, thought it pro|per to repeat &s;uch a form in &s;uch parti|cular &s;hoes or &s;lippers; another fancied it would be very decent if &s;uch a part of publick devotions were performed with a Mitre on his head, and a Cro&s;ier in his hand: To this a brother <HI>Van|dal,</HI> as wi&s;e as the others, adds an antick dre&s;s, which he conceived would allude very aptly to &s;uch and &s;uch my&s;teries, 'till by degrees the whole office has de|generated into an empty &s;how.</P>
<P>Their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;ee the vanity and in|convenience of the&s;e ceremonies; but in|&s;tead of reforming, perhaps add others, which they think more &s;ignificant, and which take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame man|ner, and are never to be driven out after they have been once admitted. I have &s;een the Pope officiate at St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s, where, for two hours together, he was bu&s;ied in putting on or off his different accoutrements, according to the different parts he was to act in them.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="194">Nothing is &s;o glorious in the eyes of mankind, and ornamental to human na|ture, &s;etting a&s;ide the infinite advantages which ari&s;e from it, as a &s;trong &s;teady ma&s;culine piety; but Enthu&s;ia&s;m and Su|per&s;tition are the weakne&s;&s;es of human rea&s;on, that expo&s;e us to the &s;corn and deri&s;ion of Infidels, and &s;ink us even be|low the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h.</P>

<P>IN my la&s;t <HI>Saturday</HI>'s paper I laid down &s;ome 
thoughts upon Devotion in ge|neral, and &s;hall here &s;hew 
what were the notions of the mo&s;t refined Heathens on this 
&s;ubject, as they are repre&s;ented in <HI>Plato</HI>'s dialogue upon Prayer, enti|tuled, <HI>Alcibiades the Second,</HI> which doubt|le&s;s gave occa&s;ion to <HI>Juvenal</HI>'s tenth Sa|tyr,
<PB N="167" REF="195">
and to the &s;econd Satyr of <HI>Per&s;ius</HI>; as the la&s;t of the&s;e authors has almo&s;t tran|&s;cribed the preceding dialogue, enti|tuled, <HI>Alcibiades the Fir&s;t,</HI> in his fourth Satyr.</P>
<P>The &s;peakers in this dialogue upon Prayer, are <HI>Socrates</HI> and <HI>Alcibiades</HI>; and the &s;ub&s;tance of it (when drawn toge|ther out of the intricacies and digre&s;&s;i|ons) as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Socrates</HI> meeting his pupil <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> as he was going to his devotions, and ob&s;erving his eyes to be fixed upon the earth with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and attenti|on, tells him, that he had rea&s;on to be thoughtful on that occa&s;ion, &s;ince it was po&s;&s;ible for a man to bring down evils upon him&s;elf by his own Prayers, and that tho&s;e things which the Gods &s;end him in an&s;wer to his petitions might turn to his de&s;truction: This, &s;ays he, may not only happen when a man prays for what he knows is mi&s;chievous in its own nature, as <HI>Oedipus</HI> implored the Gods to &s;ow di&s;&s;ention between his &s;ons, but when he prays for what he believes would be for his good, and again&s;t what he believes would be to his detriment. This the Philo&s;opher &s;hews mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily
<PB N="168" REF="196">
happen among us, &s;ince mo&s;t men are blinded with ignorance, prejudice, or pa&s;&s;ion, which hinder them from &s;eeing &s;uch things as are really beneficial to them. For an in&s;tance, he asks <HI>Alci|biades,</HI> Whether he would not be tho|roughly plea&s;ed and &s;atisfied if that God to whom he was going to addre&s;s him|&s;elf, &s;hould promi&s;e to make him the &s;o|vereign of the whole earth? <HI>Alcibiades</HI> an&s;wers, That he &s;hould doubtle&s;s look upon &s;uch a promi&s;e as the greate&s;t fa|vour that could be be&s;towed upon him. <HI>Socrates</HI> then asks him, If after receiving this great favour he would be contented to lo&s;e his life? or if he would receive it though he was &s;ure he &s;hould make an ill u&s;e of it? To both which que&s;ti|ons <HI>Alcibiades</HI> an&s;wers in the negative. <HI>Socrates</HI> then &s;hews him, from the ex|amples of others, how the&s;e might pro|bably be the effects of &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing. He then adds, That other reputed pieces of good fortune, as that of having a &s;on, or procuring the highe&s;t po&s;t in a go|vernment, are &s;ubject to the like fatal con&s;equences; which neverthele&s;s, &s;ays he, men ardently de&s;ire, and would not fail to pray for, if they thought their

prayers might be effectual for the ob|taining of them.</P>
<P>Having e&s;tabli&s;hed this great point, That all the mo&s;t apparent ble&s;&s;ings in this life are obnoxious to &s;uch dreadful con&s;equences, and that no man knows what in its events would prove to him a ble&s;&s;ing or a cur&s;e, he teaches <HI>Alcibiades</HI> after what manner he ought to pray.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, he recommends to him, as the model of his devotions, a &s;hort prayer, which a <HI>Greek</HI> Poet com|po&s;ed for the use of his friends, in the following words; <HI>O</HI> Jupiter, <HI>give us tho&s;e things which are good for us, whether they are &s;uch things as we pray for, or &s;uch things as we do not pray for; and remove from us tho&s;e things which are hurtful, though they are &s;uch things as we pray for.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, that his Di&s;ciple may ask &s;uch things as are expedient for him, he &s;hews him, that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to apply him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of true wi&s;dom, and to the knowledge of that which is his chief good, and the mo&s;t &s;uitable to the excellency of his nature.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="198">In the third and la&s;t place he informs him, that the be&s;t methods he could make u&s;e of to draw down ble&s;&s;ings up|on him&s;elf, and to render his prayers ac|ceptable, would be to live in a con|&s;tant practice of his duty towards the Gods, and towards men. Under this head he very much recommends a form of Prayer the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> made u&s;e of, in which they petition the Gods, <HI>to give them all good things, &s;o long as they were virtuous.</HI> Under this head likewi&s;e he gives a very remarkable account of an Oracle to the following purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Athenians</HI> in the war with the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> received many defeats both by &s;ea and land, they &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the oracle of <HI>Jupiter Ammon,</HI> to ask the rea&s;on why they who erected &s;o ma|ny temples to the Gods, and adorned them with &s;uch co&s;tly offerings; why they who had in&s;tituted &s;o many fe&s;ti|vals, and accompanied them with &s;uch pomps and ceremonies; in &s;hort, why they who had &s;lain &s;o many Hecatombs at their altars, &s;hould be le&s;s succe&s;sful than the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> who fell &s;o &s;hort of them in all the&s;e particulars. To this, &s;ays he, the Oracle made the following
<PB N="171" REF="199">
reply; <HI>I am better plea&s;ed with the prayer of the</HI> Lacedemonians <HI>than with all the oblations of the</HI> Greeks. As this prayer implied and encouraged virtue in tho&s;e who made it; the Philo&s;opher proceeds to &s;hew how the mo&s;t vicious man might be devout, &s;o far as victims could make him, but that his Offerings were regard|ed by the Gods as bribes, and his peti|tions as bla&s;phemies. He likewi&s;e quotes on this occa&s;ion two ver&s;es out of <HI>Homer,</HI> in which the Poet &s;ays, That the &s;cent of the <HI>Trojan</HI> &s;acrifices was carried up to heaven by the winds; but that it was not acceptable to the Gods, who were di&s;plea&s;ed with <HI>Priam</HI> and all his People.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of this dialogue is ve|ry remarkable. <HI>Socrates</HI> having deterr'd <HI>Alcibiades</HI> from the prayers and &s;acrifice which he was going to offer, by &s;etting forth the above-mentioned difficulties of performing that duty as he ought, adds the&s;e words, <HI>We mu&s;t therefore wait 'till &s;uch time as we may learn how we ought to behave our &s;elves towards the Gods, and towards men.</HI> But when will that time come, &s;ays <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> and who is it will in&s;truct us? For I would fain &s;ee this man, whoever he is. It is one, &s;ays
<PB N="172" REF="200">
<HI>Socrates,</HI> who takes care of you; but as <HI>Homer</HI> tells us, that <HI>Minerva</HI> removed the mi&s;t from <HI>Diomedes</HI> his eyes, that he might plainly di&s;cover both Gods and men; &s;o the darkne&s;s that hangs upon your mind mu&s;t be removed, before you are able to di&s;cern what is good and what is evil. Let him remove from my mind, &s;ays <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> the darkne&s;s, and what el&s;e he plea&s;es; I am determined to refu&s;e nothing he &s;hall order me, whoever he is, &s;o that I may become the better man by it. The remaining part of this dialogue is very ob&s;cure: There is &s;omething in it that would make us think <HI>Socrates</HI> hinted at him&s;elf, when he &s;poke of this Divine Teacher who was to come into the world, did he not own that he him&s;elf was in this re&s;pect as much at a lo&s;s, and in as great di&s;tre&s;s as the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>Some learned men look upon this conclu&s;ion as a prediction of our Savi|our, or at lea&s;t that <HI>Socrates,</HI> like the High-prie&s;t, prophe&s;ied unknowingly, and pointed at that Divine Teacher who was to come into the world &s;ome ages after him. However that may be, we find that this great Philo&s;opher &s;aw, by the
<PB N="173" REF="201">
light of rea&s;on, that it was &s;uitable to the goodne&s;s of the Divine Nature, to &s;end a Per&s;on into the world who &s;hould in&s;truct mankind in the duties of reli|gion, and, in particular, teach them how to Pray.</P>
<P>Whoever reads this ab&s;tract of <HI>Plato</HI>'s di&s;cour&s;e on Prayer, will, I believe, na|turally make this reflection, That the great Founder of our religion, as well by his own example, as in the form of prayer which he taught his di&s;ciples, did not only keep up to tho&s;e rules which the light of nature had &s;ugge&s;ted to this great Philo&s;opher, but in&s;tructed his di&s;ciples in the whole extent of this duty, as well as of all others. He directed them to the proper object of adoration, and taught them, according to the third rule above-mentioned, to apply them&s;elves to him in their clo&s;ets, without &s;how or o&s;tentation, and to wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth. As the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> in their form of Prayer implored the Gods in ge|neral to give them all good things &s;o long as they were virtuous, we ask in particular <HI>that our offences may be forgiven as we forgive tho&s;e of others.</HI> If we look into the &s;econd Rule which <HI>Socrates</HI> has
<PB N="174" REF="202">
pre&s;cribed, namely, That we &s;hould ap|ply our &s;elves to the knowledge of &s;uch things as are be&s;t for us, this too is ex|plained at large in the doctrines of the Go&s;pel, where we are taught in &s;everal in&s;tances to regard tho&s;e things as cur&s;es, which appear as ble&s;&s;ings in the eye of the world; and on the contrary, to e|&s;teem tho&s;e things as ble&s;&s;ings, which to the generality of mankind appear as cur&s;es. Thus in the form which is pre|&s;cribed to us we only pray for that hap|pine&s;s which is our chief good, and the great end of our Exi&s;tence, when we pe|tition the Supreme Being for <HI>the coming of his kingdom,</HI> being &s;ollicitous for no other temporal ble&s;&s;ing but our <HI>daily &s;u&s;tenance.</HI> On the other &s;ide, we pray again&s;t nothing but Sin, and a|gain&s;t <HI>Evil</HI> in general, leaving it with Omni&s;cience to determine what is really &s;uch. If we look into the fir&s;t of <HI>Socrates</HI> his rules of prayer, in which he recom|mends the above-mentioned form of the antient Poet, we find that form not only comprehended, but very much improved in the petition, wherein we pray to the Supreme Being that <HI>his Will may be done:</HI> which is of the &s;ame force with that
<PB N="175" REF="203">
form which our Saviour u&s;ed, when he prayed again&s;t the mo&s;t painful and mo&s;t ignominious of deaths, <HI>Neverthele&s;s not my Will, but thine be done.</HI> This compre|hen&s;ive petition is the mo&s;t humble, as well as the mo&s;t prudent, that can be offered up from the creature to his Creator, as it &s;uppo&s;es the Supreme Be|ing wills nothing but what is for our good, and that he knows better than our &s;elves what is &s;o.</P>

<P>REligion may be con&s;idered under two general heads. The fir&s;t com|prehends what we are to believe, the other what we are to practi&s;e. By tho&s;e things which we are to believe, I mean whatever is revealed to us in the Holy Writings, and which we could not have obtained the knowledge of by the light of nature; by the things which we are to practi&s;e, I mean all tho&s;e duties to which we are directed by rea&s;on or natural religion. The fir&s;t of the&s;e I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of Faith, the &s;e|cond by that of Morality.</P>
<P>If we look into the more &s;erious part of mankind, we find many who lay &s;o
<PB N="177" REF="205">
great a &s;tre&s;s upon faith, that they neg|lect morality; and many who build &s;o much upon morality, that they do not pay a due regard to faith. The perfect man &s;hould be defective in neither of the&s;e particulars, as will be very evident to tho&s;e who con&s;ider the benefits which ari&s;e from each of them, and which I &s;hall make the &s;ubject of this day's paper.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this general divi&s;ion of Chri&s;tian duty into morality and faith, and that they have both their peculiar ex|cellencies, the fir&s;t has the pre-eminence in &s;everal re&s;pects.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e the greate&s;t part of mo|rality (as I have &s;tated the notion of it) is of a fixt eternal nature, and will en|dure when faith &s;hall fail, and be lo&s;t in conviction.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e a Per&s;on may be qua|lified to do greater good to mankind, and become more beneficial to the world, by morality, without faith, than by faith without morality.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Becau&s;e morality gives a grea|ter perfection to humane nature, by qui|eting the mind, moderating the pa&s;&s;ions, and advancing the happine&s;s of every man in his private capacity.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="206"><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Becau&s;e the rule of morality is much more certain than that of faith, all the civilized nations of the world agreeing in the great points of mora|lity, as much as they differ in tho&s;e of faith.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Becau&s;e infidelity is not of &s;o malignant a nature as immorality; or to put the &s;ame Rea&s;on in another light, becau&s;e it is generally owned, there may be &s;alvation for a virtuous Infidel, (particularly in the ca&s;e of invincible ignorance) but none for a vicious Be|liever.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Becau&s;e faith &s;eems to draw its principal, if not all its excellency, from the influence it has upon morality; as we &s;hall &s;ee more at large, if we con|&s;ider wherein con&s;i&s;ts the excellency of faith, or the belief of revealed religion; and this I think is,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> In explaining and carrying to greater heights, &s;everal points of mora|lity.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> In furni&s;hing new and &s;tron|ger motives to enforce the practice of morality.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> In giving us more amiable ideas of the Supreme Being, more en|dearing
<PB N="179" REF="207">
notions of one another, and a truer &s;tate of our &s;elves, both in regard to the grandeur and vilene&s;s of our na|tures.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> By &s;hewing us the blackne&s;s and deformity of vice, which in the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem is &s;o very great, that he who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all perfection and the Sovereign Judge of it, is repre&s;ented by &s;everal of our Divines as hating &s;in to the &s;ame degree that he loves the Sacred Per&s;on who was made the propitiation of it.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> In being the ordinary and pre|&s;cribed method of making morality ef|fectual to &s;alvation.</P>
<P>I have only touched on the&s;e &s;everal heads, which every one who is conver|&s;ant in di&s;cour&s;es of this nature will ea|&s;ily enlarge upon in his own thoughts, and draw conclu&s;ions from them which may be u&s;eful to him in the conduct of his life. One I am &s;ure is &s;o obvious, that he cannot mi&s;s it, namely that a man cannot be perfect in his &s;cheme of morality, who does not &s;trengthen and &s;upport it with that of the Chri&s;tian faith.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="208">Be&s;ides this, I &s;hall lay down two or three other maxims which I think we may deduce from what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That we &s;hould be particularly cautious of making any thing an article of faith, which does not contribute to the confirmation or improvement of mo|rality.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That no article of faith can be true and authentick, which weakens or &s;ubverts the practical part of religion, or what I have hitherto called mora|lity.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the greate&s;t friend of morality, or natural religion, cannot po&s;|&s;ibly apprehend any danger from embra|cing Chri&s;tianity, as it is pre&s;erved pure and uncorrupt in the doctrines of our na|tional Church.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e another maxim which I think may be drawn from the forego|ing con&s;iderations, which is this, that we &s;hould, in all dubious points, con&s;i|der any ill con&s;equences that may ari&s;e from them, &s;uppo&s;ing they &s;hould be er|roneous, before we give up our a&s;&s;ent to them.</P>
<P>For example, in that di&s;putable point of per&s;ecuting men for con&s;cience &s;ake,
<PB N="181" REF="209">
be&s;ides the imbittering their minds with hatred, indignation, and all the vehe|mence of re&s;entment, and en&s;naring them to profe&s;s what they do not believe; we cut them off from the plea&s;ures and ad|vantages of &s;ociety, afflict their bodies, di&s;tre&s;s their fortunes, hurt their reputa|tions, ruin their families, make their lives painful, or put an end to them. Sure when I &s;ee &s;uch dreadful con&s;equences ri&s;ing from a principle, I would be as fully convinced of the truth of it, as of a mathematical demon&s;tration, before I would venture to act upon it, or make it a part of my religion.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e the injury done our neigh|bour is plain and evident, the principle that puts us upon doing it, of a dubious and di&s;putable nature. Morality &s;eems highly violated by the one, and whether or no a zeal for what a man thinks the true &s;y&s;tem of faith may ju&s;tify it, is very uncertain. I cannot but think, if our religion produce charity as well as zeal, it will not be for &s;hewing it &s;elf by &s;uch cruel in&s;tances. But, to conclude with the words of an excellent author, <HI>We have ju&s;t enough religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another.</HI></P>

<P>IT was the common boa&s;t of the Hea|then Philo&s;ophers, that by the effica|cy of their &s;everal doctrines, they made humane nature re&s;emble the Divine. How much mi&s;taken &s;oever they might be in the &s;everal means they propo&s;ed for this end, it mu&s;t be owned that the de&s;ign was great and glorious. The fine&s;t works of invention and imagination are of ve|ry little weight, when put in the ba|lance with what refines and exalts the rational mind. <HI>Longinus</HI> excu&s;es <HI>Homer</HI> very hand&s;omely, when he &s;ays the Poet made his Gods like men, that he might make his men appear like the Gods: But it mu&s;t be allowed that &s;everal of the ancient Philo&s;ophers acted, as <HI>Cicero</HI> wi&s;hes <HI>Homer</HI> had done; they endeavour|ed rather to make men like Gods, than Gods like men.</P>
<P>According to this general maxim in philo&s;ophy, &s;ome of them have endea|voured to place men in &s;uch a &s;tate of plea&s;ure, or indolence at lea&s;t, as they
<PB N="183" REF="211">
vainly imagined the happine&s;s of the Su|preme Being to con&s;i&s;t in. On the other hand, the mo&s;t virtuous &s;ect of Philo|&s;ophers have created a chimerical wi&s;e man, whom they made exempt from pa&s;|&s;ion and pain, and thought it enough to pronounce him All-&s;ufficient.</P>
<P>This la&s;t character, when dive&s;ted of the glare of humane philo&s;ophy that &s;ur|rounds it, &s;ignifies no more, than that a good and wi&s;e man &s;hould &s;o arm him|&s;elf with patience, as not to yield tame|ly to the violence of pa&s;&s;ion and pain; that he &s;hould learn &s;o to &s;uppre&s;s and contract his de&s;ires as to have few wants; and that he &s;hould cheri&s;h &s;o many vir|tues in his &s;oul, as to have a perpetual &s;ource of plea&s;ure in him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian religion requires, that, after having framed the be&s;t Idea, we are able, of the Divine Nature, it &s;hould be our next care to conform our &s;elves to it, as far as our imperfections will per|mit. I might mention &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the Sacred Writings on this head, to which I might add many maxims and wi&s;e &s;ayings of moral Authors among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="212">I &s;hall only in&s;tance a remarkable pa&s;|&s;age, to this purpo&s;e, out of <HI>Julian</HI>'s <HI>Cae&s;ars.</HI> The Emperor having repre&s;ent|ed all the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, with <HI>Alex|ander</HI> the Great, as pa&s;&s;ing in review be|fore the Gods, and &s;triving for the &s;u|periority, lets them all drop, excepting <HI>Alexander, Julius Cae&s;ar, Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI> Each of the&s;e great heroes of antiquity lays in his claim for the upper place; and, in order to it, &s;ets forth his actions after the mo&s;t advantageous manner. But the Gods, in&s;tead of being dazzled with the lu&s;tre of their actions, enquire, by <HI>Mercury,</HI> into the proper motive and go|verning principle that influenced them throughout the whole &s;eries of their lives and exploits. <HI>Alexander</HI> tells them, That his aim was to conquer: <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> That his was to gain the highe&s;t po&s;t in his country; <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> To govern well; <HI>Trajan,</HI> That his was the &s;ame as that of <HI>Alexander,</HI> namely, to conquer. The que&s;tion, at length, was put to <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> who replied, with great mode&s;ty, That <HI>it had always been his care to imitate the Gods.</HI> This conduct &s;eems to have gained him the mo&s;t votes and
<PB N="185" REF="213">
be&s;t place in the whole a&s;&s;embly. <HI>Mar|cus Aurelius</HI> being afterwards asked to ex|plain him&s;elf declares, That, by imita|ting the Gods, he endeavoured to imi|tate them in the u&s;e of his under&s;tanding, and of all other faculties; and, in parti|cular, That it was always his &s;tudy to have as few wants as po&s;&s;ible in him|&s;elf, and to do all the good he could to others.</P>
<P>Among the many methods by which revealed religion has advanced morality, this is one, That it has given us a more ju&s;t and perfect idea of that Being whom every rea&s;onable creature ought to imi|tate. The young man, in a heathen Comedy, might ju&s;tify his lewdne&s;s by the example of <HI>Jupiter</HI>; as, indeed, there was &s;carce any crime that might not be countenanced by tho&s;e notions of the Deity which prevailed among the com|mon people in the heathen world. Re|vealed religion &s;ets forth a proper ob|ject for imitation, in that Being who is the pattern, as well as the &s;ource, of all &s;piritual perfection.</P>
<P>While we remain in this life, we are &s;ubject to innumerable temptations, which, if li&s;ten'd to, will make us deviate from
<PB N="186" REF="214">
rea&s;on and goodne&s;s, the only things wherein we can imitate the Supreme Be|ing. In the next life we meet with no|thing to excite our inclinations that doth not de&s;erve them. I &s;hall therefore di&s;|mi&s;s my reader with this maxim, <HI>viz. Our happine&s;s in this world proceeds from the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of our de&s;ires, but in the next world from the gratification of them.</HI></P>

<P>IT is u&s;ual with polemical writers to object ill de&s;igns to their adver&s;aries. This turns their argument into &s;atyr, which, in&s;tead of &s;hewing an error in the under&s;tanding, tends only to expo&s;e the morals of tho&s;e they write again&s;t. I &s;hall not act after this manner with re|&s;pect to the <HI>Free-thinkers.</HI> Virtue, and the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, are the great ends which all men ought to promote, and &s;ome of that Sect would be thought to have at heart above the re&s;t of mankind. But &s;uppo&s;ing tho&s;e who make that pro|fe&s;&s;ion to carry on a good de&s;ign in the &s;implicity of their hearts, and according
<PB N="187" REF="215">
to their be&s;t knowledge, yet it is much to be feared, tho&s;e well-meaning &s;ouls, while they endeavoured to recommend virtue, have in reality been advancing the intere&s;ts of vice, which as I take to proceed from their ignorance of human nature, we may hope, when they become &s;en&s;ible of their mi&s;take, they will, in con&s;equence of that beneficent principle they pretend to act upon, reform their practice for the future.</P>
<P>The Sages whom I have in my eye &s;peak of virtue as the mo&s;t amiable thing in the world; but at the &s;ame time that they extol her Beauty, they take care to le&s;&s;en her Portion. Such innocent crea|tures are they, and &s;o great &s;trangers to the world, that they think this a likely method to increa&s;e the number of her admirers.</P>
<P>Virtue has in her &s;elf the mo&s;t en|gaging charms; and Chri&s;tianity, as it places her in the &s;tronge&s;t light, and adorned with all her native attractions, &s;o it kindles a new fire in the Soul, by adding to them the unutterable rewards which attend her votaries in an eternal &s;tate. Or if there are men of a Saturnine and heavy complexion, who are not ea|&s;ily
<PB N="188" REF="216">
lifted up by hope, there is the pro|&s;pect of everla&s;ting puni&s;hment to agitate their &s;ouls, and frighten them into the practice of virtue, and an aver&s;ion from vice.</P>
<P>Whereas your &s;ober <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> tell you, that virtue indeed is beautiful, and vice deformed: the former de&s;erves your love, and the latter your abhorrence; but then, it is for their own &s;ake, or on account of the good and evil which im|mediately attend them, and are in&s;epa|rable from their re&s;pective natures. As for the immortality of the Soul, or eter|nal puni&s;hments and rewards, tho&s;e are openly ridiculed, or rendered &s;u&s;pici|ous by the mo&s;t &s;ly and laboured arti|fice.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay, the&s;e men act treache|rou&s;ly in the cau&s;e of virtue; but, will any one deny, that they act fooli&s;hly, who pretend to advance the intere&s;t of it by de&s;troying or weakening the &s;trong|e&s;t motives to it, which are accommo|dated to all capacities, and fitted to work on all di&s;po&s;itions, and enforcing tho&s;e alone which can affect only a generous and exalted mind?</P>

<P>It is my opinion the <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> &s;hould be treated as a &s;ett of poor ignorant creatures, that have not &s;en&s;e to di&s;co|ver the excellency of religion; it being evident tho&s;e men are no witches, nor likely to be guilty of any deep de&s;ign, who proclaim aloud to the world, that they have le&s;s motives of hone&s;ty than the re&s;t of their fellow-&s;ubjects; who have all the inducements to the exerci&s;e of any virtue which a <HI>Free-thinker</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly have, and be&s;ides, the expecta|tion of never-ending happine&s;s or mi&s;ery as the con&s;equence of their choice.</P>
<P>Are not men actuated by their pa&s;&s;i|ons; and are not hope and fear the mo&s;t powerful of our pa&s;&s;ions? and are there any objects which can rou&s;e and awaken our hopes and fears, like tho&s;e pro&s;pects that warm and penetrate the heart of a Chri|&s;tian,
<PB N="190" REF="218">
but are not regarded by a <HI>Free-thinker.</HI></P>
<P>It is not only a clear point, that a Chri&s;tian breaks through &s;tronger en|gagements whenever he &s;urrenders him|&s;elf to commit a criminal action, and is &s;tung with a &s;harper remor&s;e after it, than a <HI>Free-thinker</HI>; but it &s;hould even &s;eem that a man who believes no future &s;tate, would act a fooli&s;h part in being tho|roughly hone&s;t. For what rea&s;on is there why &s;uch a one &s;hould po&s;tpone his own private intere&s;t or plea&s;ure to the doing his duty? If a Chri&s;tian foregoes &s;ome pre&s;ent advantage for the &s;ake of his con|&s;cience, he acts accountably, becau&s;e it is with the view of gaining &s;ome greater future good. But he that, having no &s;uch view, &s;hould yet con&s;cientiou&s;ly deny him&s;elf a pre&s;ent good in any incident where he may &s;ave appearances, is alto|gether as &s;tupid as he that would tru&s;t him at &s;uch a juncture.</P>
<P>It will, perhaps, be &s;aid, that virtue is her own reward, that a natural gratifi|cation attends good actions, which is a|lone &s;ufficient to excite men to the per|formance of them. But although there is nothing more lovely than virtue, and
<PB N="191" REF="219">
the practice of it is the &s;ure&s;t way to &s;olid, natural happine&s;s, even in this life; yet titles, e&s;tates, and fanta&s;tical plea&s;ures, are more ardently &s;ought after by mo&s;t men, than the natural gratifications of a rea&s;onable mind; and it cannot be de|nied, that virtue and innocence are not always the readie&s;t methods to attain that &s;ort of happine&s;s. Be&s;ides, the fumes of pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be allayed, and rea&s;on mu&s;t burn brighter than ordinary, to enable men to &s;ee and reli&s;h all the native beau|ties and delights of a virtuous life. And tho' we &s;hould grant our <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> to be a &s;ett of refined &s;pirits, capable only of being enamoured of virtue, yet what would become of the bulk of mankind who have gro&s;s under&s;tandings, but live|ly &s;en&s;es and &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions? What a deluge of lu&s;t, and fraud, and violence would in a little time overflow the whole nation, if the&s;e wi&s;e advocates for mora|lity were univer&s;ally hearkened to? La&s;t|ly, opportunities do &s;ometimes offer in which a man may wickedly make his fortune, or indulge a plea&s;ure, without fear of temporal damage, either in repu|tation, health, or fortune. In &s;uch ca&s;es what re&s;traint do they lie under who have
<PB N="192" REF="220">
no regards beyond the grave? the inward compunctions of a wicked, as well as the joys of an upright mind, being grafted on the &s;en&s;e of another &s;tate.</P>
<P>The thought, <HI>that our Exi&s;tence ter|minates with this life,</HI> doth naturally check the &s;oul in any generous pur&s;uit, con|tract her views, and fix them on tem|porary and &s;elfi&s;h ends. It dethrones the rea&s;on, extingui&s;hes all noble and heroick &s;entiments, and &s;ubjects the mind to the &s;lavery of every pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;ion. The wi&s;e Heathens of antiquity were not ig|norant of this; hence they endeavoured by fables, and conjectures, and the glim|merings of nature, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the minds of men with the belief of a future &s;tate, which has been &s;ince brought to light by the Go&s;pel, and is now mo&s;t incon|&s;i&s;tently decry'd by a few weak men, who would have us believe that they promote Virtue by turning Religion in|to ridicule.</P>

<P>IT is owing to pride, and a &s;ecret af|fectation of a certain &s;elf-exi&s;tence, that the noble&s;t motive for action that ever was propo&s;ed to man, is not acknowledged the glory and happine&s;s of their Being. The heart is treacherous to it &s;elf, and we do not let our reflecti|ons go deep enough to receive religion as the mo&s;t honourable incentive to good and worthy actions. It is our natural weakne&s;s, to flatter our &s;elves into a be|lief, that if we &s;earch into our inmo&s;t thoughts, we find our &s;elves wholly di&s;|intere&s;ted, and dive&s;ted of any views ari|&s;ing from &s;elf-love and vain-glory. But
<PB N="201" REF="229">
however &s;pirits of &s;uperficial greatne&s;s may di&s;dain at fir&s;t fight to do any thing, but from a noble impul&s;e in them&s;elves, without any future regards in this or an|other Being; upon &s;tricter enquiry they will find, to act worthily and expect to be rewarded only in another world, is as heroick a pitch of virtue as human na|ture can arrive at. If the tenor of our actions have any other motive than the de&s;ire to be plea&s;ing in the eye of the Deity, it will nece&s;&s;arily follow that we mu&s;t be more than men, if we are not too much exalted in pro&s;perity and de|pre&s;&s;ed in adver&s;ity: But the Chri&s;tian world has a leader, the contemplation of who&s;e life and &s;ufferings mu&s;t admini&s;ter comfort in affliction, while the &s;en&s;e of his Power and Omnipotence mu&s;t give them humiliation in pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>It is owing to the forbidden and un|lovely con&s;traint with which men of low conceptions act when they think they conform them&s;elves to religion, as well as to the more odious conduct of hypo|crites, that the word Chri&s;tian does not carry with it at fir&s;t view all that is great, worthy, friendly, generous, and heroick. The man who &s;u&s;pends his
<PB N="202" REF="230">
hopes of the reward of worthy actions till after death, who can be&s;tow un&s;een, who can overlook hatred, do good to his &s;landerer, who can never be angry at his friend, never revengeful to his ene|my, is certainly formed for the benefit of &s;ociety: Yet the&s;e are &s;o far from he|roick virtues, that they are but the or|dinary duties of a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>When a man with a &s;teady faith looks back on the great cata&s;trophe of this day, with what bleeding emotions of heart mu&s;t he contemplate the life and &s;uffer|ings of his deliverer? When his agonies occur to him, how will he weep to re|flect that he has often forgot them for the glance of a wanton, for the applau&s;e of a vain world, for an heap of fleeting pa&s;t plea&s;ures, which are at pre&s;ent aking &s;orrows?</P>
<P>How plea&s;ing is the contemplation of the lowly &s;teps our Almighty Leader took in conducting us to his heavenly man&s;ions! In plain and apt parable, &s;i|militude, and allegory, our great Ma&s;ter enforced the doctrine of our &s;alvation; but they of his acquaintance, in&s;tead of receiving what they could not oppo&s;e, were offended at the pre&s;umption of be|ing
<PB N="203" REF="231">
wi&s;er than they: They could not rai&s;e their little ideas above the con&s;ide|ration of him, in tho&s;e circum&s;tances familiar to them, or conceive that he who appear'd not more terrible or pom|pous, &s;hould have any thing more ex|alted than them&s;elves; he in that place therefore would not longer ineffectually exert a power which was incapable of conquering the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their nar|row and mean conceptions.</P>
<P>Multitudes follow'd him, and brought him the dumb, the blind, the &s;ick, and maim'd; whom when their Creator had touch'd, with a &s;econd life they &s;aw, &s;poke, leap'd, and ran. In affection to him, and admiration of his actions, the crowd could not leave him, but waited near him till they were almo&s;t as faint and helple&s;s as others they brought for &s;uccour. He had compa&s;&s;ion on them, and by a miracle &s;upplied their nece&s;&s;i|ties. Oh, the ec&s;tatic entertainment, when they could behold their food immediately increa&s;e to the Di&s;tributer's hand, and &s;ee their God in per&s;on feeding and refre&s;hing his creatures! Oh envied happine&s;s! But why do I &s;ay envied? as if our God did not &s;till pre&s;ide over our temperate meals,

<P>The great change of things began to draw near, when the Lord of Nature thought fit as a Saviour and Deliverer to make his publick entry into <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem</HI> with more than the power and joy, but none of the o&s;tentation and pomp of a triumph; he came humble, meek, and
<PB N="205" REF="233">
lowly: with an unfelt new ec&s;tacy, mul|titudes &s;trewed his way with garments and olive-branches, crying with loud gladne&s;s and acclamation, <HI>Ho&s;annah to the &s;on of</HI> David, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord!</HI> At this great King's acce&s;&s;ion to his throne, men were not en|nobled, but &s;av'd; crimes were not re|mitted, but &s;ins forgiven; he did not be|&s;tow medals, honours, favours, but health, joy, &s;ight, &s;peech. The fir&s;t object the blind ever &s;aw, was the Author of Sight; while the lame ran before, and the dumb repeated the <HI>Ho&s;annah.</HI> Thus attended, he entered into his own hou&s;e, the &s;a|cred temple, and by his Divine Autho|rity expell'd traders and worldlings that profaned it; and thus did he, for a time, u&s;e a great and de&s;potick power, to let unbelievers under&s;tand, that 'twas not want of, but &s;uperiority to, all worldly dominion, that made him not exert it. But is this then the Saviour? is this the Deliverer? Shall this ob&s;eure <HI>Nazarene</HI> command <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;it on the throne of <HI>David?</HI> Their proud and di&s;dainful hearts, which were petrified with the love and pride of this world, were impregnable to the reception of &s;o mean a benefactor,

and were now enough exa&s;perated with benefits to con&s;pire his death. Our Lord was &s;en&s;ible of their de&s;ign, and prepa|red his di&s;ciples for it, by recounting to 'em now more di&s;tinctly what &s;hould be|fal him; but <HI>Peter</HI> with an ungrounded re&s;olution, and in a flu&s;h of temper, made a &s;anguine prote&s;tation, that tho' all men were offended in him, yet would not he be offended. It was a great article of our Saviour's bu&s;ine&s;s in the world, to bring us to a &s;en&s;e of our inability, without God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to do any thing great or good; he therefore told <HI>Peter,</HI> who thought &s;o well of his courage and fide|lity, that they would both fail him, and even he &s;hould deny him thrice that very night.</P>

The other is, his raking together and exaggerating, with great &s;pleen and indu&s;try, all tho&s;e actions of church-men, which, either by their own illne&s;s or the bad light in which he places them, tend to give men an ill impre&s;&s;ion of the di&s;pen&s;ers of the Go&s;pel: All which he pathetically addre&s;&s;es to the con&s;ide|ration of his wi&s;e and hone&s;t countrymen of the laiety.

<P>THERE is a certain coldne&s;s and indifference in the phra&s;es of our <HI>European</HI> languages, when they are compared with the oriental forms of &s;peech; and it happens very luckily, that the <HI>Hebrew</HI> idioms run into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tongue with a particular grace and beau|ty. Our language has received innume|rable elegancies and improvements, from that infu&s;ion of <HI>Hebrai&s;ms,</HI> which are de|rived to it out of the poetical pa&s;&s;ages in Holy Writ. They give a force and ener|gy to our expre&s;&s;ions, warm and animate our language, and convey our thoughts
<PB N="211" REF="239">
in more ardent and inten&s;e phra&s;es, than any that are to be met with in our own tongue. There is &s;omething &s;o pathe|tick in this kind of diction, that it often &s;ets the mind in a flame, and makes our hearts burn within us. How cold and dead does a prayer appear, that is com|po&s;ed in the mo&s;t elegant and polite forms of &s;peech, which are natural to our tongue, when it is not heightned by that &s;olemnity of phra&s;e, which may be drawn from the Sacred Writings. It has been &s;aid by &s;ome of the ancients, that if the Gods were to talk with men, they would certainly &s;peak in <HI>Plato</HI>'s &s;tyle; but I think we may &s;ay, with ju&s;tice, that when mortals conver&s;e with their Creator, they cannot do it in &s;o proper a &s;tyle as in that of the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P>If any one would judge of the beau|ties of poetry that are to be met with in the Divine Writings, and examine how kindly the <HI>Hebrew</HI> manners of &s;peech mix and incorporate with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lan|guage; after having peru&s;ed the book of P&s;alms, let him read a literal tran&s;lation of <HI>Horace</HI> or <HI>Pindar.</HI> He will find in the&s;e two la&s;t &s;uch an ab&s;urdity and confu&s;ion of &s;tyle, with &s;uch a comparative pover|ty
<PB N="212" REF="240">
of imagination, as will make him ve|ry &s;en&s;ible of what I have been here ad|vancing.</P>
<P>Since we have therefore &s;uch a trea&s;ury of words, &s;o beautiful in them&s;elves, and &s;o proper for the airs of mu&s;ick, I can|not but wonder that per&s;ons of di&s;tinction &s;hould give &s;o little attention and encou|ragement to that kind of mu&s;ick, which would have its foundation in rea&s;on, and which would improve our virtue in pro|portion as it rai&s;ed our delight. The pa&s;&s;ions that are excited by ordinary compo&s;itions generally flow from &s;uch &s;illy and ab&s;urd occa&s;ions, that a man is a&s;hamed to reflect upon them &s;eriou&s;ly; but the fear, the love, the &s;orrow, the indignation that are awakened in the mind by hymns and anthems, make the heart better, and proceed from &s;uch cau&s;es as are altogether rea&s;onable and prai&s;e|worthy. Plea&s;ure and duty go hand in hand, and the greater our &s;atisfaction is, the greater is our religion.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ick among tho&s;e who were &s;tyled the cho&s;en people was a religious art. The &s;ongs of <HI>Sion,</HI> which we have rea&s;on to believe were in high repute among the courts of the Ea&s;tern Monarchs, were
<PB N="213" REF="241">
nothing el&s;e but P&s;alms and pieces of Poetry that adored or celebrated the Su|preme Being. The greate&s;t conqueror in this Holy Nation, after the manner of the old <HI>Grecian</HI> Lyricks, did not only compo&s;e the words of his Divine Odes, but generally &s;et them to mu&s;ick him&s;elf: After which, his works, tho' they were con&s;ecrated to the tabernacle, became the national entertainment, as well as the devotion of his people.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t original of the Drama was a religious wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ting only of a Chorus, which was nothing el&s;e but an hymn to a Deity. As luxury and volup|tuou&s;ne&s;s prevailed over innocence and religion, this form of wor&s;hip degene|rated into Tragedies; in which however the Chorus &s;o far remembered its fir&s;t of|fice, as to brand every thing that was vicious, and recommend every thing that was laudable; to intercede with heaven for the innocent, and to implore its ven|geance on the criminal.</P>
<P><HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>He&s;iod</HI> intimate to us how this art &s;hould be applied, when they re|pre&s;ent the <HI>Mu&s;es</HI> as &s;urrounding <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and warbling their hymns about his throne. I might &s;hew from innumerable
<PB N="214" REF="242">
&s;ages in ancient Writers, not only that vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ick were made u&s;e of in their religious wor&s;hip, but that their mo&s;t favourite diver&s;ions were fil|led with &s;ongs and hymns to their re|&s;pective Deities. Had we frequent en|tertainments of this nature among us, they would not a little purify and exalt our pa&s;&s;ions, give our thoughts a proper turn, and cheri&s;h tho&s;e divine impul&s;es in the &s;oul, which every one feels that has not &s;tifled them by &s;en&s;ual and immoderate plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ick, when thus applied, rai&s;es no|ble hints in the mind of the hearer, and fills it with great conceptions. It &s;trength|ens devotion, and advances prai&s;e in|to rapture. It lengthens out every act of wor&s;hip, and produces more la&s;ting and permanent impre&s;&s;ions in the mind, than tho&s;e which accompany any tran&s;i|ent form of words that are uttered in the ordinary method of religious wor|&s;hip.</P>

<P><Q REND="margQuotes">I appeal to any man, whether this be not a repre&s;entation of things very proper and &s;uitable to that <HI>great day,</HI> wherein he who made the world &s;hall come to judge it?

<P>This ob&s;ervation was worthy a mo&s;t polite man, and ought to be of authori|ty with all who are &s;uch, &s;o far as to ex|amine whether he &s;poke that as a man of a ju&s;t ta&s;te and judgment, or advanced it merely for the &s;ervice of his doctrine as a clergyman.</P>
<P>I am very confident whoever reads the Go&s;pels, with an heart as much prepa|red in favour of them as when he &s;its down to <HI>Virgil</HI> or <HI>Homer,</HI> will find no pa&s;&s;age there which is not told with more natural force than any epi&s;ode in either of tho&s;e wits, who were the chief of mere mankind.</P>
<P>The la&s;t thing I read was the 24th chapter of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> which gives an ac|count of the manner in which our ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour, after his re&s;urrection, joined with two di&s;ciples on the way to <HI>Em|maus</HI> as an ordinary traveller, and took the privilege as &s;uch to enquire of them what occa&s;ioned a &s;adne&s;s he ob&s;erved in

their countenances; or whether it was from any publick cau&s;e? Their wonder that any man &s;o near <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;hould be a &s;tranger to what had pa&s;&s;ed there; their acknowledgment to one they met accidentally that they had believed in this Prophet; and that now, the third day after his death, they were in doubt as to their plea&s;ing hope which occa|&s;ioned the heavine&s;s he took notice of, are all repre&s;ented in a &s;tyle which men of letters call <HI>the great and noble &s;implicity.</HI> The attention of the Di&s;ciples, when he expounded the Scriptures concerning him&s;elf, his offering to take his leave of them, their fondne&s;s of his &s;tay, and the manife&s;tation of the great gue&s;t whom they had entertained while he was yet at meat with them, are all incidents which wonderfully plea&s;e the imagination of a Chri&s;tian reader; and give to him &s;ome|thing of that touch of mind which the brethren felt, when they &s;aid one to an|other, <HI>Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the Scriptures?</HI></P>
<P>I am very far from pretending to treat the&s;e matters as they de&s;erve; but I hope tho&s;e Gentlemen who are qualified for it,

and called to it, will forgive me, and con&s;ider that I &s;peak as a meer &s;ecular man, impartially con&s;idering the effect which the Sacred Writings will have upon the &s;oul of an intelligent reader; and it is &s;ome argument, that a thing is the immediate work of God, when it &s;o infinitely tran&s;cends all the labours of man. When I look upon <HI>Raphael</HI>'s pi|cture of our Saviour appearing to his Di&s;ciples after his re&s;urrection, I cannot but think the ju&s;t di&s;po&s;ition of that piece has in it the force of many volumes on the &s;ubject: The Evangeli&s;ts are ea&s;i|ly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t by a pa&s;|&s;ionate zeal and love which the Painter has thrown in their faces; the huddle group of tho&s;e who &s;tand mo&s;t di&s;tant are admirable repre&s;entations of men a|ba&s;hed with their late unbelief and hard|ne&s;s of heart. And &s;uch endeavours as this of <HI>Raphael,</HI> and of all men not cal|led to the altar, are collateral helps not to be de&s;pi&s;ed by the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>'Tis with this view that I pre&s;ume up|on &s;ubjects of this kind, and men may take up this paper, and be catched by an admonition under the di&s;gui&s;e of a di|ver&s;ion.</P>

<P>AFTER having treated of fal&s;e Zealots in Religion, I cannot for|bear mentioning a mon&s;trous &s;pe|cies of men, who one would not think had any exi&s;tence in nature, were they not to be met with in ordinary conver&s;a|tion, I mean the Zealots in Athei&s;m. One would fancy that the&s;e men, tho' they fall &s;hort, in every other re&s;pect, of tho&s;e who make a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, would at lea&s;t out-&s;hine them in this par|ticular, and be exempt from that &s;ingle fault which &s;eems to grow out of the imprudent fervours of religion: But &s;o it is, that Infidelity is propagated with as much fiercene&s;s and contention, wrath and indignation, as if the &s;afety of man|kind
<PB N="223" REF="251">
depended upon it. There is &s;ome|thing &s;o ridiculous and perver&s;e in this kind of Zealots, that one does not know how to &s;et them out in their proper co|lours. They are a &s;ort of game&s;ters who are eternally upon the fret, tho' they play for nothing. They are perpetually teiz|ing their friends to come over to them, though at the &s;ame time they allow that neither of them &s;hall get any thing by the bargain. In &s;hort, the zeal of &s;preading Athei&s;m is, if po&s;&s;ible, more ab&s;urd than Athei&s;m it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Since I have mentioned this unac|countable Zeal which appears in Athei&s;ts and Infidels, I mu&s;t further ob&s;erve that they are likewi&s;e in a mo&s;t particular manner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;pirit of bigo|try. They are wedded to opinions full of contradiction and impo&s;&s;ibility, and at the &s;ame time look upon the &s;malle&s;t difficulty in an article of faith as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for rejecting it. Notions that fall in with the common rea&s;on of mankind, that are conformable to the &s;en&s;e of all ages and all nations, not to mention their tendency for promoting the happine&s;s of &s;ocieties, or of particular per&s;ons, are ex|ploded as errors and prejudices; and
<PB N="224" REF="252">
&s;chemes erected in their &s;tead that are al|together mon&s;trous and irrational, and require the mo&s;t extravagant credulity to embrace them. I would fain ask of one the&s;e bigotted Infidels, &s;uppo&s;ing all the great points of Athei&s;m, as the ca&s;ual or eter|nal formation of the world, the materi|ality of a thinking &s;ub&s;tance, the morta|lity of the Soul, the fortuitous organi|zation of the body, the motions and gra|vitation of matter, with the like particu|lars, were laid together and formed into a kind of Creed, according to the opini|ons of the mo&s;t celebrated Athei&s;ts; I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a Creed as this were formed, and impo&s;ed upon any one peo|ple in the world, whether it would not require an infinitely greater mea&s;ure of faith, than any &s;et of articles which they &s;o violently oppo&s;e. Let me therefore advi&s;e this generation of Wranglers, for their own and for the publick good, to act at lea&s;t &s;o con&s;i&s;tently with them|&s;elves, as not to burn with Zeal for Ir|religion, and with Bigotry for Non-&s;en&s;e.</P>

<P>UPon my return to my lodgings la&s;t night I found a letter from my worthy friend the Clergyman, whom I have given &s;ome account of in my former papers.

<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>A Believer may be excu&s;ed by the mo&s;t hardened Athei&s;t for endeavour|ing to make him a Convert, becau&s;e he does it with an eye to both their inte|re&s;ts.

Why will any man be &s;o impertinently officious, as to tell me all this is only fancy and delu&s;ion? Is there any me|rit in being the me&s;&s;enger of ill news?

<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I do not know how to tru&s;t a man who believes neither heaven nor hell, or in other words, a future State of rewards and puni&s;h|ments. Not only natural &s;elf-love, but rea&s;on directs us to promote our own intere&s;t above all things. It can never be for the intere&s;t of a Believer to do me a mi&s;chief, becau&s;e he is &s;ure upon the ballance of accompts to find him|&s;elf
<PB N="227" REF="255">
a lo&s;er by it. On the contrary, if he con&s;iders his own welfare in his be|haviour towards me, it will lead him to do me all the good he can, and at the &s;ame time re&s;train him from doing me an injury. An Unbeliever does not act like a rea&s;onable creature, if he fa|vours me contrary to his pre&s;ent inte|re&s;t, or does not di&s;tre&s;s me when it turns to his pre&s;ent advantage. Ho|nour and good-nature may indeed tie up his hands; but as the&s;e would be very much &s;trengthened by rea&s;on and principle, &s;o without them they are only in&s;tincts, or wavering un&s;ettled notions, which re&s;t on no foundation.</P>
<P>Infidelity has been attacked with &s;o good &s;ucce&s;s of late years, that it is driven out of all its out-works. The Athei&s;t has not found his po&s;t tenable, and is therefore retired into Dei&s;m, and a disbelief of revealed Religion only. But the truth of it is, the greate&s;t num|ber of this &s;et of men, are tho&s;e who, for want of a virtuous education, or examining the grounds of Religion, know &s;o very little of the matter in que&s;tion, that their Infidelity is but a|nother term for their ignorance.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="256">
As folly and incon&s;ideratene&s;s are the foundations of Infidelity, the great pillars and &s;upports of it are either a vanity of appearing wi&s;er than the re&s;t of mankind, or an o&s;tentation of cou|rage in de&s;pi&s;ing the terrors of ano|ther world, which have &s;o great an influence on what they call weaker minds; or an aver&s;ion to a belief that mu&s;t cut them off from many of tho&s;e plea&s;ures they propo&s;e to them&s;elves, and fill them with remor&s;e for many of tho&s;e they have already ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>The great received articles of the Chri&s;tian Religion have been &s;o clearly proved, from the authority of that Di|vine Revelation in which they are de|livered, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e who have ears to hear and eyes to &s;ee, not to be convinced of them. But were it po&s;&s;ible for any thing in the Chri&s;tian faith to be erroneous, I can find no ill con&s;equences in adhering to it. The great points, of the Incarna|tion and Sufferings of our Saviour, produce naturally &s;uch habits of virtue in the mind of man, that I &s;ay, &s;up|po&s;ing it were po&s;&s;ible for us to be mi|&s;taken in them, the Infidel him&s;elf mu&s;t
<PB N="229" REF="257">
at lea&s;t allow that no other &s;y&s;tem of Religion could &s;o effectually contribute to the heightning of morality. They give us great ideas of the dignity of human nature, and of the love which the Supreme Being bears to his crea|tures, and con&s;equently engage us in the highe&s;t acts of duty towards our Creator, our neighbour, and our &s;elves. How many noble arguments has Saint <HI>Paul</HI> rai&s;ed from the chief articles of our Religion, for the advancing of mo|rality in its three great branches? To give a &s;ingle example in each kind: What can be a &s;tronger motive to a firm tru&s;t and reliance on the mercies of our Maker, than the giving us his Son to &s;uffer for us? What can make us love and e&s;teem even the mo&s;t in|con&s;iderable of mankind, more than the thought that Chri&s;t died for him? Or what di&s;po&s;e us to &s;et a &s;tricter guard upon the purity of our own hearts, than our being members of Chri&s;t, and a part of the &s;ociety of which that im|maculate Per&s;on is the Head?

If our modern Infidels con&s;idered the&s;e matters with that candour and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s which they de&s;erve, we &s;hould not &s;ee them act with &s;uch a &s;pirit of bitterne&s;s, arrogance, and ma|lice: they would not be rai&s;ing &s;uch in|&s;ignificant cavils, doubts and &s;cruples, as may be &s;tarted again&s;t every thing that is not capaple of mathematical de|mon&s;tration; in order to un&s;ettle the minds of the ignorant, di&s;turb the pub|lick peace, &s;ubvert morality, and throw all things into confu&s;ion and di&s;order. If none of the&s;e reflections can have any influence on them, there is one that perhaps may, becau&s;e it is adapted to their vanity, by which they &s;eem to be guided much more than their rea|&s;on.

<P>HAVING endeavoured in my la&s;t <HI>Saturday</HI>'s paper to &s;hew the great excellency of faith, I &s;hall here con&s;ider what are the proper means of &s;trength|ning and confirming it in the mind of man. Tho&s;e who delight in reading books of controver&s;y, which are written on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion in points of faith, do very &s;eldom arrive at a fixed and &s;et|tled habit of it. They are one day en|tirely convinced of its important truths, and the next meet with &s;omething that &s;hakes and di&s;turbs them. The doubt which was laid revives again, and &s;hews it &s;elf in new difficulties, and that gene|rally for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e the mind which is perpetually to&s;t in controver&s;ies and di&s;putes, is apt to forget the rea&s;ons which had once &s;et it at re&s;t, and to be di&s;quieted with any former perplexity, when it appears in a new &s;hape, or is &s;tarted by a different hand. As nothing is more laudable than an enquiry after
<PB N="233" REF="261">
truth, &s;o nothing is more irrational than to pa&s;s away our whole lives, without determining our &s;elves one way or other in tho&s;e points which are of the la&s;t im|portance to us. There are indeed many things from which we may with-hold our a&s;&s;ent; but in ca&s;es by which we are to regulate our lives, it is the greate&s;t ab|&s;urdity to be wavering and un&s;ettled, without clo&s;ing with that &s;ide which ap|pears the mo&s;t &s;afe and the mo&s;t proba|ble.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t rule therefore which I &s;hall lay down is this, that when by reading or di&s;cour&s;e we find our &s;elves thorough|ly convinced of the truth of any article, and of the rea&s;onablene&s;s of our belief in it, we &s;hould never after &s;uffer our &s;elves to call it into que&s;tion. We may per|haps forget the arguments which occa|&s;ioned our conviction, but we ought to remember the &s;trength they had with us, and therefore &s;till to retain the convi|ction which they once produced. This is no more than what we do in every common art or &s;cience, nor is it po&s;&s;ible to act otherwi&s;e, con&s;idering the weak|ne&s;s and limitation of our intellectual fa|culties. It was thus that <HI>Latimer,</HI> one
<PB N="234" REF="262">
of the glorious army of martyrs who in|troduced the reformation in <HI>England,</HI> be|haved him&s;elf in that great conference which was managed between the mo&s;t learned among the Prote&s;tants and Pa|pi&s;ts in the reign of Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> This venerable old man knowing how his abi|lities were impaired by age, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to recollect all tho&s;e rea&s;ons which had directed him in the choice of his religion, left his com|panions, who were in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their parts and learning, to baffle and confound their antagoni&s;ts by the force of rea&s;on. As for him&s;elf he only re|peated to his adver&s;aries the articles in which he firmly believed, and in the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of which he was determined to die. It is in this manner that the Ma|thematician proceeds upon propo&s;itions which he has once demon&s;trated; and though the demon&s;tration may have &s;lipt out of his memory, he builds upon the truth, becau&s;e he knows it was demon|&s;trated. This rule is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for weaker minds, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure for men of the greate&s;t abilities.</P>
<P>But to the&s;e la&s;t I would propo&s;e, in the &s;econd place, that they &s;hould lay
<PB N="235" REF="263">
up in their memories, and always keep by them in a readine&s;s, tho&s;e arguments which appear to them of the greate&s;t &s;trength, and which cannot be got over by all the doubts and cavils of infide|lity.</P>
<P>But, in the third place, there is no|thing which &s;trengthens faith more than morality. Faith and morality naturally produce each other. A man is quickly convinced of the truth of religion, who finds it is not again&s;t his intere&s;t that it &s;hould be true. The plea&s;ure he receives at pre&s;ent, and the happine&s;s which he promi&s;es him&s;elf from it hereafter, will both di&s;po&s;e him very powerfully to give credit to it, according to the ordinary ob&s;ervation that <HI>we are ea&s;y to believe what we wi&s;h.</HI> It is very certain, that a man of &s;ound rea&s;on cannot forbear clo|&s;ing with religion upon an impartial exa|mination of it; but at the &s;ame time it is as certain, that faith is kept alive in us, and gathers &s;trength from practice more than from &s;peculation.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another method which is more per&s;ua&s;ive than any of the former, and that is an habitual adoration of the Supreme Being, as well in con&s;tant acts
<PB N="236" REF="264">
of mental wor&s;hip, as in outward forms. The devout man does not only believe but feels there is a Deity. He has actual &s;en&s;ations of him; his experience con|curs with his rea&s;on; he &s;ees him more and more in all his intercour&s;es with him, and even in this life almo&s;t lo&s;es his faith in conviction.</P>
<P>The la&s;t method which I &s;hall men|tion for the giving life to a man's faith, is frequent retirement from the world, accompanied with religious meditation. When a man thinks of any thing in the darkne&s;s of the night, whatever deep impre&s;&s;ions it may make in his mind, they are apt to vani&s;h as &s;oon as the day breaks about him. The light and noi&s;e of the day, which are perpetually &s;olliciting his &s;en&s;es, and calling off his attention, wear out of his mind the thoughts that im|printed them&s;elves in it, with &s;o much &s;trength, during the &s;ilence and dark|ne&s;s of the night. A man finds the &s;ame difference as to him&s;elf in a crowd and in a &s;olitude: The mind is &s;tunned and dazzled amid&s;t that variety of objects which pre&s;s upon her in a great city: She cannot apply her&s;elf to the con&s;ide|ration of tho&s;e things which are of the
<PB N="237" REF="265">
utmo&s;t concern to her. The cares or plea&s;ures of the world &s;trike in with eve|ry thought, and a multitude of vicious examples give a kind of ju&s;tification to our folly. In our retirements every thing di&s;po&s;es us to be &s;erious. In courts and cities we are entertained with the works of men; in the country with tho&s;e of God. One is the province of art, the other of nature. Faith and devotion na|turally grow in the mind of every rea|&s;onable man, who &s;ees the impre&s;&s;ions of Divine Power and Wi&s;dom in every ob|ject, on which he ca&s;ts his eye. The Supreme Being has made the be&s;t argu|ments for his own Exi&s;tence, in the for|mation of the heavens and the earth, and the&s;e are arguments which a man of &s;en&s;e cannot forbear attending to, who is out of the noi&s;e and hurry of human affairs. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;ays, that &s;hould a man live un|der ground, and there conver&s;e with works of art and mechani&s;m, and &s;hould afterwards be brought up into the open day, and &s;ee the &s;everal glories of the heaven and earth, he would immediately pronounce them the works of &s;uch a Be|ing as we define God to be.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE arrived in this neigh|bourhood two days ago one of your gay gentlemen of the town, who being attended at his entry with a &s;ervant of his own, be&s;ides a country|man he had taken up for a guide, ex|cited the curio&s;ity of the village to learn whence and what he might be. The countryman (to whom they ap|plied as mo&s;t ea&s;y of acce&s;s) knew lit|tle more than that the gentleman came from <HI>London</HI> to travel and &s;ee fa&s;hions, and was, as he heard &s;ay, a Free-thinker: What religion that might be, he could not tell; and for his own part, if they had not told him the man was a Free-thinker, he &s;hould have gue&s;&s;ed, by his way of talking, he was
<PB N="241" REF="269">
little better than a Heathen; except|ing only that he had been a good gen|tleman to him, and made him drunk twice in one day, over and above what they had bargained for.</P>
<P>I do not look upon the &s;implicity of this, and &s;everal odd enquiries with which I &s;hall trouble you, to be won|dered at, much le&s;s can I think that our youths of fine wit, and enlarged under&s;tandings, have any rea&s;on to laugh. There is no nece&s;&s;ity that eve|ry &s;quire in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;hould know what the word Free-thinker &s;tands for; but it were much to be wi&s;hed, that they who valued them&s;elves upon that conceited title, were a little better in|&s;tructed in what it ought to &s;tand for; and that they would not per&s;wade them|&s;elves a man is really and truly a Free-thinker in any tolerable &s;en&s;e, merely by virtue of his being an Athei&s;t, or an Infidel of any other di&s;tinction. It may be doubted, with good rea&s;on, whether there ever was in nature a more abject, &s;lavi&s;h, and bigotted ge|neration than the tribe of <HI>Beaux E&s;prits,</HI> at pre&s;ent &s;o prevailing in this i&s;land, Their preten&s;ion to be Free-thinkers&punc;

<P>I Am diverted from the account I was giving the town of my particular con|cerns, by ca&s;ting my eye upon a trea|ti&s;e, which I could not overlook with|out an inexcu&s;able negligence, and want of concern for all the civil, as well as re|ligious intere&s;ts of mankind.

delivered this definition, from which one would expect he did not de&s;ign to &s;hew a particular inclination for or again&s;t any thing before he had con&s;idered it, he gives up all title to the character of a <HI>Free-thinker,</HI> with the mo&s;t appa|rent prejudice again&s;t a body of men, whom of all other a good man would be mo&s;t careful not to violate, I mean men in holy orders. Per&s;ons who have devo|ted them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of God, are venerable to all who fear him; and it is a certain characteri&s;tick of a di&s;&s;o|lute and ungovern'd mind, to rail or &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of them in general. It is certain, that in &s;o great a crowd of men &s;ome will intrude, who are of tem|pers very unbecoming their function; but becau&s;e ambition and avarice are &s;ometimes lodged in that bo&s;om, which ought to be the dwelling of &s;anctity and devotion, mu&s;t this unrea&s;onable Author villify the whole order? He has not ta|ken the lea&s;t care to di&s;gui&s;e his being an enemy to the per&s;ons again&s;t whom he writes, nor any where granted that the in&s;titution of religious men to &s;erve at the altar, and in&s;truct &s;uch who are not as wi&s;e as him&s;elf, is at all nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="245" REF="273">
or de&s;irable; but proceeds without the lea&s;t apology, to undermine their cre|dit, and fru&s;trate their labours: What|ever clergy-men in di&s;putes again&s;t each other, have unguardedly uttered, is here recorded in &s;uch a manner as to affect religion it&s;elf, by wre&s;ting conce&s;&s;ions to its di&s;advantage from its own teachers. If this be true, as &s;ure any man that reads the di&s;cour&s;e mu&s;t allow it is; and if religion is the &s;tronge&s;t tie of human &s;ociety; in what manner are we to treat this our common enemy, who promotes the growth of &s;uch a &s;ect as he calls <HI>Free-thinkers:</HI> He that &s;hould burn a hou&s;e, and ju&s;tify the action by a&s;&s;ert|ing he is a free agent, would be more excu&s;able than this Author in uttering what he has from the right of a <HI>Free-thinker:</HI> But they are a &s;et of dry, joy|le&s;s, dull fellows, who want capacities and talents to make a figure among&s;t mankind upon benevolent and generous principles, that think to &s;urmount their own natural meanne&s;s, by laying offen|ces in the way of &s;uch as make it their endeavour to excel upon the received maxims and hone&s;t arts of life. If it were po&s;&s;ible to laugh at &s;o melancholy an af|fair

as what hazards &s;alvation, it would be no unplea&s;ant enquiry to ask what &s;a|tisfaction they reap, what extraordinary gratification of &s;en&s;e, or what delicious libertini&s;m this &s;ect of <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> en|joy, after getting loo&s;e of the laws which confine the pa&s;&s;ions of other men? Would it not be a matter of mirth to find, after all, that the heads of this growing &s;ect are &s;ober wretches, who prate whole evenings over coffee, and have not them|&s;elves fire enough to be any further de|bauchees, than merely in principle? The&s;e &s;ages of iniquity are, it &s;eems, them&s;elves only &s;peculatively wicked, and are con|tented that all the abandoned young men of the age are kept &s;afe from reflection by dabbling in their rhap&s;odies, without ta&s;ting the plea&s;ures for which their do|ctrines leave them unaccountable. Thus do heavy mortals, only to gratify a dry pride of heart, give up the intere&s;ts of another world, without enlarging their gratifications in this; but it is certain that there are a &s;ort of men that can puz|zle truth, but cannot enjoy the &s;atisfa|ction of it. This &s;ame <HI>Free-thinker</HI> is a creature unacquainted with the emotions which po&s;&s;e&s;s great minds when they are
<PB N="247" REF="275">
turned for religion, and it is apparent that he is untouched with any &s;uch &s;en|&s;ation as the rapture of devotion. What|ever one of the&s;e &s;corners may think, they certainly want parts to be devout; and a &s;en&s;e of piety towards heaven, as well as the &s;en&s;e of any thing el&s;e, is live|ly and warm in proportion to the facul|ties of the head and heart. This gentle|man may be a&s;&s;ured he has not a ta&s;te for what he pretends to decry, and the poor man is certainly more a blockhead than an Athei&s;t. I mu&s;t repeat, that he wants capacity to reli&s;h what true piety is; and he is as capable of writing an heroick Poem, as making a fervent Pray|er. When men are thus low and nar|row in their apprehen&s;ions of things, and at the &s;ame time vain, they are na|turally led to think every thing they do not under&s;tand, not to be under&s;tood. Their contradiction to what is urged by others, is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of their incapacity to receive it. The athei&s;tical fellows who appeared the la&s;t age did not &s;erve the devil for nought; but re|velled in exce&s;&s;es &s;uitable to their prin|ciples, while in the&s;e unhappy days mi&s;|chief is done for mi&s;chief's &s;ake. The&s;e

<HI>Free-thinkers,</HI> who lead the lives of re+clu&s;e &s;tudents, for no other purpo&s;e but to di&s;turb the &s;entiments of other men put me in mind of the mon&s;trous re|creation of tho&s;e late wild youths, who, without provocation, had a wantonne&s;s in &s;tabbing and defacing tho&s;e they met with. When &s;uch writers as this, who has no &s;pirit but that of malice, pretend to inform the age, <HI>Mohocks</HI> and Cut-throats may well &s;et up for wits and men of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It will be perhaps expected, that I &s;hould produce &s;ome in&s;tances of the ill intention of this <HI>Free-thinker,</HI> to &s;upport the treatment I here give him. In his 52d page he &s;ays,</P>

<P>AS I was, the other day, taking a &s;o|litary walk in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, I indulged my thoughts in the pur&s;uit of a certain analogy between the Fabrick and the <HI>Chri&s;tian Church</HI> in the large&s;t &s;en&s;e. The divine order and oeconomy of the one &s;eemed to be emblematically &s;et forth by the ju&s;t, plain, and maje&s;tick architecture of the other. And as the one con&s;i&s;ts of a great variety of parts united in the &s;ame regular de&s;ign, according to the true&s;t art, and mo&s;t exact proportion; &s;o the other contains a decent &s;ubordination of members, various &s;acred in&s;titutions, &s;u|blime doctrines, and &s;olid precepts of morality dige&s;ted into the &s;ame de&s;ign,
<PB N="251" REF="279">
and with an admirable concurrence tend|ing to one view, the happine&s;s and ex|altation of human nature.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of my contemplation I beheld a Fly upon one of the Pillars; and it &s;traitway came into my head, that this &s;ame Fly was a <HI>Free-thinker.</HI> For it required &s;ome comprehen&s;ion in the eye of the Spectator, to take in at one view the various parts of the building, in or|der to ob&s;erve their &s;ymmetry and de|&s;ign. But to the Fly, who&s;e pro&s;pect was confined to a little part of one of the &s;tones of a &s;ingle pillar, the joint beauty of the whole, or the di&s;tinct u&s;e of its parts, were incon&s;picuous, and no|thing could appear but &s;mall inequalities in the &s;urface of the hewn &s;tone, which in the view of that in&s;ect &s;eemed &s;o ma|ny deformed rocks and precipices.</P>
<P>The thoughts of a <HI>Free-thinker</HI> are em|ployed on certain minute particularities of Religion, the difficulty of a &s;ingle text, or the unaccountablene&s;s of &s;ome &s;tep of Providence or point of doctrine to his narrow faculties, without com|prehending the &s;cope and de&s;ign of Chri|&s;tianity, the perfection to which it rai|&s;eth human nature, the light it hath &s;hed
<PB N="252" REF="280">
abroad in the world, and the clo&s;e con|nexion it hath as well with the good of publick &s;ocieties, as with that of parti|cular per&s;ons.</P>
<P>This rai&s;ed in me &s;ome reflections on that frame or di&s;po&s;ition which is called <HI>largene&s;s of mind,</HI> its nece&s;&s;ity towards forming a true judgment of things, and where the Soul is not incurably &s;tinted by nature, what are the likelie&s;t methods to give it enlargement.</P>
<P>It is evident that Philo&s;ophy doth open and enlarge the mind, by the gene|ral views to which men are habituated in that &s;tudy, and by the contemplation of more numerous and di&s;tant objects, than fall within the &s;phere of mankind in the ordinary pur&s;uits of life. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that Philo&s;ophers judge of mo&s;t things very differently from the vulgar. Some in&s;tances of this may be &s;een in the <HI>Theaetetus</HI> of <HI>Plato,</HI> where <HI>Socrates</HI> makes the following remarks, among o|thers of the like nature.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">When a Philo&s;opher hears ten thou|&s;and acres mentioned as a great e&s;tate, he looks upon it as an incon&s;ider|able &s;pot, having been u&s;ed to con|template the whole globe of earth.
<PB N="253" REF="281">
Or when he beholds a man elated with the nobility of his race, becau&s;e he can reckon a &s;eries of &s;even rich ance&s;tors, the Philo&s;opher thinks him a &s;tupid ig|norant fellow, who&s;e mind cannot reach to a general view of human na|ture, which would &s;hew him that we have all innumerable ance&s;tors, among whom are crowds of rich and poor, Kings and Slaves, <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Barbari|ans.</HI></Q>
Thus far <HI>Socrates,</HI> who was ac|counted wi&s;er than the re&s;t of the Hea|thens, for notions which approach the neare&s;t to Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>As all parts and branches of Philo&s;o|phy, or &s;peculative knowledge, are u&s;e|ful in that re&s;pect, A&s;tronomy is peculi|arly adapted to remedy a little and nar|row &s;pirit. In that &s;cience there are good rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned to prove the &s;un an hun|dred thou&s;and times bigger than our earth; and the di&s;tance of the &s;tars &s;o prodigious, that a Cannon-bullet conti|nuing in its ordinary rapid motion, would not arrive from hence at the neare&s;t of them, in the &s;pace of an hundred and fifty thou&s;and years. The&s;e ideas won|derfully dilate and expand the mind. There is &s;omething in the immen&s;ity of
<PB N="254" REF="282">
this di&s;tance, that &s;hocks and over|whelms the imagination, it is too big for the gra&s;p of a human intellect: E&s;tates, Provinces, and Kingdoms vani&s;h at its pre&s;ence. It were to be wi&s;hed a cer|tain Prince, who hath encouraged the &s;tudy of it in his &s;ubjects, had been him|&s;elf a proficient in A&s;tronomy. This might have &s;hewed him how mean an ambition that was, which terminated in a &s;mall part of what is it &s;elf but a point, in re&s;pect of that part of the univer&s;e which lies within our view.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion</HI> ennobleth and enlargeth the mind beyond any o|ther profe&s;&s;ion or &s;cience what&s;oever. Upon that &s;cheme, while the earth, and the tran&s;ient enjoyments of this life, &s;hrink in the narrowe&s;t dimen&s;ions, and are accounted as <HI>the du&s;t of a balance, the drop of a bucket, yea le&s;s than nothing,</HI> the intellectual world opens wider to our view: The perfections of the Deity, the nature and excellence of virtue, the dig|nity of the human &s;oul, are di&s;played in the large&s;t characters. The mind of man &s;eems to adapt it &s;elf to the different na|ture of its objects; it is contracted and deba&s;ed by being conver&s;ant in little and
<PB N="255" REF="283">
low things, and feels a proportionable enlargement ari&s;ing from the contem|plation of the&s;e great and &s;ublime ideas.</P>
<P>The greatne&s;s of things is compara|tive; and this does not only hold, in re|&s;pect of exten&s;ion, but likewi&s;e in re&s;pect of dignity, duration, and all kinds of perfection. A&s;tronomy opens the mind, and alters our judgment, with regard to the magnitude of extended Beings; but Chri&s;tianity produceth an univer&s;al great|ne&s;s of Soul. Philo&s;ophy encrea&s;eth our views in every re&s;pect, but Chri&s;tianity extends them to a degree beyond the light of nature.</P>
<P>How mean mu&s;t the mo&s;t exalted Po|tentate upon earth appear to that eye which takes in innumerable orders of ble&s;&s;ed Spirits, differing in glory and perfection? How little mu&s;t the amu&s;ements of &s;en&s;e, and the ordinary occupations of mortal men, &s;eem to one who is engaged in &s;o noble a pur&s;uit, as the a&s;&s;imilation of him&s;elf to the Deity, which is the pro|per employment of every Chri&s;tian!</P>
<P>And the improvement which grows from habituating the mind to the com|prehen&s;ive views of Religion mu&s;t not be thought wholly to regard the under|&s;tanding.
<PB N="256" REF="284">
Nothing is of greater force to &s;ubdue the inordinate motions of the heart, and to regulate the will. Whe|ther a man be actuated by his pa&s;&s;ions or his rea&s;on, the&s;e are fir&s;t wrought up|on by &s;ome object, which &s;tirs the &s;oul in proportion to its apparent dimen&s;ions. Hence irreligious men, who&s;e &s;hort pro|&s;pects are filled with earth, and &s;en&s;e, and mortal life, are invited, by the&s;e mean ideas, to actions proportionably little and low. But a mind, who&s;e views are en|lightened and extended by Religion, is animated to nobler pur&s;uits by more &s;ub|lime and remote objects.</P>
<P>There is not any in&s;tance of weakne&s;s in the <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> that rai&s;es my indig|nation more, than their pretending to ri|dicule Chri&s;tians, as men of narrow un|der&s;tandings, and to pa&s;s them&s;elves up|on the world for per&s;ons of &s;uperior &s;en&s;e, and more enlarged views. But I leave it to any impartial man to judge which hath the nobler &s;entiments, which the greater views; he who&s;e notions are &s;tinted to a few mi&s;erable inlets of &s;en&s;e, or he who&s;e &s;entiments are rai&s;ed above the common ta&s;te by the anticipation of tho&s;e delights which will &s;atiate the &s;oul, when the

He who looks for nothing beyond this &s;hort &s;pan of du|ration, or he who&s;e aims are co-extended with the endle&s;s length of Eternity?

<P>SInce you have not refu&s;ed to in&s;ert matters of a Theological nature in tho&s;e excellent papers, with which you daily both in&s;truct and divert us, I earne&s;tly de&s;ire you to print the fol|lowing paper. The notions therein ad|vanced are, for ought I know, new to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader, and if they are true, will afford room for many u&s;eful in|ferences.</P>
<P>No man that reads the Evangeli&s;ts, but mu&s;t ob&s;erve that our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour does upon every occa&s;ion bend all his force and zeal to rebuke and correct the hypocri&s;ie of the <HI>Phari&s;ees.</HI> Upon that &s;ubject he &s;hews a warmth which one meets with in no other part
<PB N="258" REF="286">
of his &s;ermons. They were &s;o enraged at this publick detection of their &s;e|cret villanies, by one who &s;aw through all their di&s;gui&s;es, that they joined in the pro&s;ecution of him, which was &s;o vigorous, that <HI>Pilate</HI> at la&s;t con&s;ented to his death. The frequency and ve|hemence of the&s;e reprehen&s;ions of our Lord, have made the word <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> to be looked upon as odious among Chri|&s;tians, and to mean only one who lays the utmo&s;t &s;tre&s;s upon the Outward, Ceremonial, and Ritual part of his Re|ligion, without having &s;uch an inward &s;en&s;e of it, as would lead him to a ge|neral and &s;incere ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e duties which can only ari&s;e from the heart, and which cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;pring from a de&s;ire of applau&s;e or profit.</P>
<P>This is plain from the hi&s;tory of the life and actions of our Lord, in the four Evangeli&s;ts. One of them, St. <HI>Luke,</HI> continued his hi&s;tory down in a &s;e|cond part, which we commonly call the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles.</HI> Now it is ob&s;er|vable, that in this &s;econd part, in which he gives a particular account of what the Apo&s;tles did and &s;uffered at <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI>
<PB N="259" REF="287">
upon their fir&s;t entring upon their commi&s;&s;ion, and al&s;o of what St. <HI>Paul</HI> did after he was con&s;ecrated to the A|po&s;tle&s;hip 'till his journey to <HI>Rome,</HI> we find not only no opposition to Chri&s;ti|anity from the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> but &s;everal &s;ignal occa&s;ions in which they a&s;&s;i&s;ted its fir&s;t Teachers, when the Chri&s;tian Church was in its infant State. The true, zealous and hearty per&s;ecutors of Chri&s;tianity at that time were the <HI>Sad|ducees,</HI> whom we may truly call the <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> among the <HI>Jews.</HI> They believed neither Re&s;urrection, nor An|gel, nor Spirit, <HI>i. e.</HI> in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they were <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> at lea&s;t, if not <HI>Athei&s;ts.</HI> They could outwardly comply with, and conform to the e&s;tabli&s;hment in Church and State, and they pretended for&s;ooth to belong only to a particular Sect, and becau&s;e there was nothing in the law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> which in &s;o many words a&s;&s;erted a Re&s;urrection, they ap|peared to adhere to that in a particular manner beyond any other part of the Old Te&s;tament. The&s;e men therefore ju&s;tly dreaded the &s;preading of Chri&s;ti|anity after the a&s;cen&s;ion of our Lord,
<PB N="260" REF="288">
becau&s;e it was wholly founded upon his Re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>Accordingly therefore when <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> had cured the lame man at the beautiful gate of the Temple, and had thereby rai&s;ed a wonderful expectation of them&s;elves among the people, the Prie&s;ts and <HI>Sadducees, Acts</HI> 4. clapt them up, and &s;ent them away for the fir&s;t time with a &s;evere reprimand. Quickly after, when the deaths of <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira,</HI> and the many miracles wought after tho&s;e &s;evere in&s;tances of the apo&s;tolical power had alarmed the <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> who looked upon the Temple wor&s;hip, and con&s;equently their Bread, to be &s;truck at, the&s;e Prie&s;ts, and all they that were with them, who were of the &s;ect of the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> impri&s;oned the Apo&s;tles, intending to examine them in the great Council the next day. Where, when the Council met, and the Prie&s;ts and <HI>Sadducees</HI> propo&s;ed to proceed with great Rigor again&s;t them, we find that <HI>Gamaliel</HI> a very emi|nent <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s ma&s;ter, a man of great authority among the people, many of who&s;e determinations we have
<PB N="261" REF="289">
&s;till pre&s;erved in the body of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> traditions, commonly called the <HI>Tal|mud,</HI> oppo&s;ed their heat, and told them, for ought they knew the Apo&s;tles might be acted by the Spirit of God, and that in &s;uch a ca&s;e it would be in vain to oppo&s;e them, &s;ince if they did &s;o, they would only fight again&s;t God, whom they could not overcome. <HI>Gamaliel</HI> was &s;o con&s;iderable a man among&s;t his own Sect, that we may rea&s;onably be|lieve he &s;poke the &s;en&s;e of his party as well as his own. St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s mar|tyrdom came on pre&s;ently after, in which we do not find the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> as &s;uch, had any hand; it is probable that he was pro&s;ecuted by tho&s;e who had before impri&s;oned <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John.</HI> One Novice indeed of that Sect was &s;o zealous that he kept the cloaths of tho&s;e that &s;toned him. This Novice, who&s;e zeal went beyond all bounds, was the great St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who was pe|culiarly honoured with a Call from Heaven by which he was converted, and he was afterwards, by God him&s;elf, appointed to be the Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Be&s;ides him, and him too re|claimed
<PB N="262" REF="290">
in &s;o glorious a manner, we find no one <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> either named or hinted at by St. <HI>Luke,</HI> as an oppo&s;er of Chri&s;tianity in tho&s;e earlie&s;t days. What others might do we know not. But we find the <HI>Sadducees</HI> pur&s;uing St. <HI>Paul</HI> even to death at his coming to <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI> in the 21&s;t of the <HI>Acts.</HI> He then, upon all occa&s;ions, owned him&s;elf to be a <HI>Phari&s;ee.</HI> In the 22d Chapter he told the people, that he had been bred up at the feet of <HI>Gamaliel</HI> after the &s;tricte&s;t manner, in the Law of his Fa|thers. In the 23d Chapter he told the Council that he was a <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> the &s;on of a <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> and that he was accu&s;ed for a&s;&s;erting the Hope and Re&s;urrecti|on of the dead, which was their dar|ling doctrine. Hereupon the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> &s;tood by him, and though they did not own our Saviour to be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> yet they would not deny but &s;ome An|gel or Spirit might have &s;poken to him, and then if they oppo&s;ed him they &s;hould fight again&s;t God. This was the very argument <HI>Gamaliel</HI> had u&s;ed be|fore. The Re&s;urrection of our Lord, which they &s;aw &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted
<PB N="263" REF="291">
by the Apo&s;tles, who&s;e miracles they al&s;o &s;aw and owned, (<HI>Acts</HI> 4.16.) &s;eems to have &s;truck them, and many of them were converted (<HI>Acts</HI> 15.5) even without a miracle, and the re&s;t &s;tood &s;till and made no oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>We &s;ee here what the part was which the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> acted in this im|portant conjuncture. Of the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> we meet not with one in the whole apo&s;tolic hi&s;tory that was converted. We hear of no miracles wrought to convince any of them, tho' there was an eminent one wrought to reclaim a <HI>Pha|ri&s;ee.</HI> St. <HI>Paul,</HI> we &s;ee, after his con|ver&s;ion always gloried in his having been bred a <HI>Phari&s;ee.</HI> He did &s;o to the people of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to the great Council, to King <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and to the <HI>Philippians.</HI> So that from hence we may ju&s;tly infer, that it was not their in&s;titution, which was in it&s;elf laudable, which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour found fault with, but it was their hypocri&s;ie, their covetou&s;ne&s;s, their oppre&s;&s;ion, their overvaluing them&s;elves upon their zeal for the ceremonial Law, and their ad|ding to that yoke by their traditions,
<PB N="264" REF="292">
all which were not properly e&s;&s;entials of their in&s;titution, that our Lord blamed.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not run on. What I would ob&s;erve, Sir, is, that Athei&s;m is more dreadful, and would be more grievous to human &s;ociety, if it were inve&s;ted with &s;ufficient power, than Religion under any &s;hape, where its profe&s;&s;ors do at the bottom believe what they profe&s;s. I de&s;pair not of a Papi&s;t's conver&s;ion, tho' I would not willingly lie at a zealot Papi&s;t's mercy, (and no Prote&s;tant would, if he knew what Popery is) tho' he truly believes in our Saviour. But the <HI>Free-thinker,</HI> who &s;carcely believes there is a God, and certainly disbelieves Revelation, is a very terrible Animal. He will talk of <HI>natural rights,</HI> and the ju&s;t freedoms of mankind, no longer than 'till he him&s;elf gets into power; and by the in&s;tance before us, we have &s;mall grounds to hope for his &s;alvation, or that God will ever vouch&s;afe him &s;uf|ficient grace to reclaim him from er|rors, which have been &s;o immediately levelled again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>

<P>I Am fully per&s;uaded that one of the be&s;t &s;prings of generous and wor|thy actions, is the having generous and worthy thoughts of our &s;elves. Whoever has a mean opinion of the dignity of his nature, will act in no higher a rank than he has allotted him|&s;elf in his own e&s;timation. If he con|&s;iders his Being as circum&s;cribed by the uncertain term of a few years, his de|&s;igns will be contracted into the &s;ame
<PB N="267" REF="295">
narrow &s;pan he imagines is to bound his Exi&s;tence. How can he exalt his thoughts to any thing great and no|ble, who only believes that, after a &s;hort turn on the &s;tage of this world, he is to &s;ink into oblivion, and to lo&s;e his Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s for ever?</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on I am of opinion, that &s;o u&s;eful and elevated a contemplation as that of the <HI>Soul's Immortality</HI> cannot be re&s;umed too often. There is not a more improving exerci&s;e to the human mind, than to be frequently reviewing its own great privileges and endow|ments; nor a more effectual means to awaken in us an ambition rai&s;ed above low objects and little pur&s;uits, than to value our &s;elves as heirs of eternity.</P>
<P>It is very great &s;atisfaction to con|&s;ider the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of mankind in all nations and ages, a&s;&s;erting, as with one voice, this their birth-right, and to find it ratify'd by an expre&s;s revelation. At the &s;ame time, if we turn our thoughts inward upon our|&s;elves, we may meet with a kind of &s;ecret &s;en&s;e concurring with the proofs of our own immortality.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="296">
You have, in my opinion, rai&s;ed a good pre&s;umptive argument from the encrea&s;ing appetite the mind has to knowledge, and to the extending its own faculties, which cannot be accom|pli&s;hed, as the more re&s;trained perfe|ction of lower creatures may, in the limits of a &s;hort life. I think another probable conjecture may be rai&s;ed from our appetite to duration it &s;elf, and from a reflection on our progre&s;s thro' the &s;everal &s;tages of it: <HI>We are com|plaining,</HI> as you ob&s;erve in a former &s;peculation, <HI>of the &s;hortne&s;s of life, and yet are perpetually hurrying over the parts of it, to arrive at certain little &s;ettlements or imaginary points of re&s;t, which are di&s;|per&s;ed up and down in it.</HI></P>
<P>Now let us con&s;ider what happens to us when we arrive at the&s;e <HI>imaginary points of re&s;t:</HI> Do we &s;top our motion, and &s;it down &s;atisfied in the &s;ettlement we have gain'd? or are we not remo|ving the boundary, and marking out new points of re&s;t, to which we pre&s;s forward with the like eagerne&s;s, and which cea&s;e to be &s;uch as fa&s;t as we at|tain them? Our ca&s;e is like that of a traveller upon the <HI>Alps,</HI> who &s;hould
<PB N="269" REF="297">
fancy that the top of the next hill mu&s;t end his journey, becau&s;e it terminates his pro&s;pect; but he no &s;ooner arrives at it, than he &s;ees new ground and other hills beyond it, and continues to travel on as before.</P>
<P>This is &s;o plainly every man's con|dition in life, that there is no one who has ob&s;erved any thing, but may ob&s;erve, that as fa&s;t as his time wears away, his appetite to &s;omething future remains. The u&s;e therefore I would make of it, is this; That &s;ince Nature (as &s;ome love to expre&s;s it) does nothing in vain, or, to &s;peak properly, &s;ince the Author of our Being has planted no wander|ing pa&s;&s;ion in it, no de&s;ire which has not its object, Futurity is the proper object of the pa&s;&s;ion &s;o con&s;tantly ex|erci&s;ed about it; and this re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s in the pre&s;ent, this a&s;&s;igning our &s;elves over to farther &s;tages of duration, this &s;ucce&s;&s;ive gra&s;ping at &s;omewhat &s;till to come, appears to me (whatever it may to others) as a kind of in&s;tinct or natu|ral &s;ymptom which the mind of man has of its own immortality.</P>
<P>I take it at the &s;ame time for grant|ed, that the Immortality of the &s;oul is
<PB N="270" REF="298">
&s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed by other argu|ments: and if &s;o, this appetite, which otherwi&s;e would be very unaccountable and ab&s;urd, &s;eems very rea&s;onable, and adds &s;trength to the conclu&s;ion. But I am amazed when I con&s;ider there are creatures capable of thought, who, in &s;pite of every argument, can form to them&s;elves a &s;ullen &s;atisfaction in thinking otherwi&s;e. There is &s;ome|thing &s;o pitifully mean in the inverted ambition of that man who can hope for annihilation, and plea&s;e him&s;elf to think that his whole fabrick &s;hall one day crumble into du&s;t, and mix with the ma&s;s of inanimate Beings, that it equal|ly de&s;erves our admiration and pity. The my&s;tery of &s;uch mens unbelief is not hard to be penetrated; and indeed amounts to nothing more than a &s;or|did hope that they &s;hall not be immor|tal, becau&s;e they dare not be &s;o.</P>
<P>This brings me back to my fir&s;t ob|&s;ervation, and gives me occa&s;ion to &s;ay further, That as worthy actions &s;pring from worthy thoughts, &s;o worthy thoughts are likewi&s;e the con&s;equence of worthy actions: But the wretch who has degraded him&s;elf below the cha|racter
<PB N="271" REF="299" MS="y">
of immortality, is very willing to re&s;ign his preten&s;ions to it, and to &s;ub&s;titute in its room a dark negative happine&s;s in his extinction of his Being.</P>
<P>The admirable <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has given us a &s;trong image of the un&s;upported condition of &s;uch a per&s;on in his la&s;t minutes, in the &s;econd part of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, where Cardinal <HI>Beau|fort,</HI> who had been concerned in the mur|ther of the good Duke <HI>Humphrey,</HI> is re|pre&s;ented on his death-bed. After &s;ome &s;hort confu&s;ed &s;peeches which &s;hew an imagination di&s;turbed with guilt, ju&s;t as he is expiring, King <HI>Henry</HI> &s;tanding by him full of compa&s;&s;ion, &s;ays,

<L>Hold up thy hand, make &s;ignal of that hope!</L>
<L>He dies, and makes no &s;ign!</L></Q></P>
<P>The de&s;pair which is here &s;hewn, without a word or action on the part of the dying per&s;on, is beyond what could be painted by the mo&s;t forcible expre&s;&s;ions whatever.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pur&s;ue this thought fur|ther, but only add, That as annihila|tion is not be had with a wi&s;h, &s;o it is the mo&s;t abject thing in the world to

<P>THE <HI>time pre&s;ent</HI> &s;eldom affords &s;uffi|cient employment to the mind of man. Objects of pain or plea&s;ure, love or admiration, do not lie thick enough together in life to keep the Soul in con|&s;tant action, and &s;upply an immediate ex|erci&s;e to its faculties. In order, there|fore, to remedy this defect, that the mind may not want bu&s;ine&s;s, but always have materials for thinking, &s;he is endowed with certain powers, that can recal what is pa&s;&s;ed, and anticipate what is to come.</P>
<P>That wonderful faculty, which we call the Memory, is perpetually looking back, when we have nothing pre&s;ent to enter|tain us. It is like tho&s;e repo&s;itories in &s;everal animals, that are filled with &s;tores
<PB N="273" REF="301">
of their former food, on which they may ruminate when their pre&s;ent pa&s;ture fails.</P>
<P>As the memory relieves the mind in her vacant moments, and prevents any cha&s;ms of thought by ideas of what is <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> we have other faculties that agitate and employ her upon what <HI>is to come.</HI> The&s;e are the pa&s;&s;ions of hope and fear.</P>
<P>By the&s;e two pa&s;&s;ions we reach forward into futurity, and bring up to our pre|&s;ent thoughts objects that lie hid in the remote&s;t depths of time. We &s;uf|fer mi&s;ery, and enjoy happine&s;s, before they are in Being; we can &s;et the &s;un and &s;tars forward, or lo&s;e &s;ight of them by wandring into tho&s;e retired parts of eternity, when the heavens and earth &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>By the way, who can imagine that the Exi&s;tence of a creature is to be circum|&s;cribed by time, who&s;e Thoughts are not? But I &s;hall, in this paper, confine my &s;elf to that particular pa&s;&s;ion which goes by the name of Hope.</P>
<P>Our actual enjoyments are &s;o few and tran&s;ient, that man would be a very mi|&s;erable Being, were he not endowed with this pa&s;&s;ion, which gives him a ta&s;te of tho&s;e good things that may po&s;&s;ibly come
<PB N="274" REF="302">
into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. <HI>We &s;hould hope for every thing that is good,</HI> &s;ays the old Poet <HI>Linus, becau&s;e there is nothing which may not be hoped for, and nothing but what the Gods are able to give us.</HI> Hope quickens all the &s;till parts of life, and keeps the mind awake in her mo&s;t remi&s;s and indo|lent hours. It gives habitual &s;erenity and good humour. It is a kind of vital heat in the &s;oul, that chears and gladdens her, when &s;he does not attend to it. It makes pain ea&s;y, and labour plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the&s;e &s;everal advantages which ri&s;e from <HI>Hope,</HI> there is another which is none of the lea&s;t, and that is, its great efficacy in pre&s;erving us from &s;etting too high a value on pre&s;ent enjoyments. The &s;aying of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> is very well known. When he had given away all his e&s;tate in gratuities among his friends, one of them asked what he had left for him&s;elf; to which that great man replied, <HI>Hope.</HI> His natural magnanimity hindred him from prizing what he was certainly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and turned all his thoughts up|on &s;omething more valuable that he had in view. I que&s;tion not but every rea|der will draw a moral from this &s;tory, and apply it to him&s;elf without my direction.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="303">The old &s;tory of <HI>Pandora</HI>'s box (which) many of the learned believe was formed among the Heathens upon the tradition of the fall of man) &s;hews us how deplo|rable a &s;tate they thought the pre&s;ent life, without Hope: To &s;et forth the ut|mo&s;t condition of mi&s;ery they tell us, that our forefather, according to the Pa|gan Theology, had a great ve&s;&s;el pre|&s;ented him by <HI>Pandora:</HI> Upon his lifting up the lid of it, &s;ays the fable, there flew out all the calamities and di&s;tempers in|cident to men, from which, till that time, they had been altogether exempt. <HI>Hope,</HI> who had been enclo&s;ed in the cup with &s;o much bad company, in&s;tead of flying of with the re&s;t, &s;tuck &s;o clo&s;e to the lid of it, that it was &s;hut down up|on her.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make but two reflections upon what I have hitherto &s;aid. Fir&s;t, that no kind of life is &s;o happy as that which is full of hope, e&s;pecially when the hope is well grounded, and when the object of it is of an exalted kind, and in its na|ture proper to make the per&s;on happy who enjoys it. This propo&s;ition mu&s;t be very evident to tho&s;e who con&s;ider how few are the pre&s;ent enjoyments of
<PB N="276" REF="304">
the mo&s;t happy man, and how in&s;uffi|cient to give him an entire &s;atisfaction and acquie&s;cence in them.</P>
<P>My next ob&s;ervation is this, That a religious life is that which mo&s;t abounds in a well-grounded Hope, and &s;uch an one as is fixed on objects that are capa|ble of making us entirely happy. This hope in a religious man, is much more &s;ure and certain than the hope of any temporal ble&s;&s;ing, as it is &s;trengthened not only by rea&s;on, but by faith. It has at the &s;ame time its eye perpetually fixed on that &s;tate, which implies in the very notion of it the mo&s;t full and the mo&s;t compleat happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I have before &s;hewn how the influ|ence of hope in general &s;weetens life, and makes our pre&s;ent condition &s;up|portable, if not plea&s;ing; but a religious hope has &s;till greater advantages. It does not only bear up the mind under her &s;ufferings, but makes her rejoice in them, as they may be the in&s;truments of pro|curing her the great and ultimate end of all her hope.</P>
<P>Religious hope has likewi&s;e this ad|vantage above any other kind of hope, that it is able to revive the <HI>dying</HI> man,
<PB N="277" REF="305">
and to fill his mind not only with &s;ecret comfort and refre&s;hment, but &s;ometimes with rapture and tran&s;port. He triumphs in his agonies, whil&s;t the &s;oul &s;prings forward with delight to the great ob|ject which &s;he has always had in view, and leaves the body with an expectation of being re-united to her in a glorious and joyful re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this E&s;&s;ay with tho&s;e em|phatical expre&s;&s;ions of a lively hope, which the P&s;almi&s;t made u&s;e of in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e dangers and adver&s;ities which &s;ur|rounded him; for the following pa&s;&s;age had its pre&s;ent and per&s;onal, as well as its fu|ture and prophetick &s;en&s;e. <HI>I have &s;et the Lord always before me: Becau&s;e he is at right hand I &s;hall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my fle&s;h al&s;o &s;hall re&s;t in hope. For thou wilt not leave my &s;oul in hell, neither wilt thou &s;uffer thine holy one to &s;ee corruption. Thou wilt &s;hew me the path of life: in thy pre&s;ence is fulne&s;s of joy, at thy right hand there are plea&s;ures for evermore.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To the <HI>SPECTATOR.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been u&s;ual to remind per&s;ons of rank, on great occa&s;ions in life, of their race and quality, and to what expectations they were born; that by con&s;idering what is worthy of them, they may be withdrawn from mean pur&s;uits, and encouraged to laudable undertakings. This is turning Nobility into a principle of virtue, and making it productive of merit, as it is under|&s;tood to have been originally a reward of it.</P>
<P>It is for the like rea&s;on, I imagine, that you have in &s;ome of your &s;pecula|tions a&s;&s;erted to your readers the <HI>Dig|nity of Human Nature.</HI> But you can|not be in&s;en&s;ible that this is a contro|verted doctrine; there are Authors who con&s;ider human nature in a very diffe|rent view, and books of maxims have been written to &s;hew the <HI>Fal&s;ity of all Human Virtues.</HI> The reflections which
<PB N="279" REF="307">
are made on this &s;ubject u&s;ually take &s;ome tincture from the tempers and characters of tho&s;e that make them. Politicians can re&s;olve the mo&s;t &s;hining actions among men into artifice and de&s;ign; others, who are &s;oured by di&s;|content, repul&s;es, or ill u&s;age, are apt to mi&s;take their &s;pleen for philo&s;ophy; men of profligate lives, and &s;uch as find them&s;elves incapable of ri&s;ing to any di&s;tinction among their fellow-crea|tures, are for pulling down all appea|rances of merit, which &s;eem to upbraid them: and Satiri&s;ts de&s;cribe nothing but deformity. From all the&s;e hands we have &s;uch draughts of mankind as are repre&s;ented in tho&s;e burle&s;que pi|ctures, which the <HI>Italians</HI> call <HI>Caraca|tura's</HI>; where the art con&s;i&s;ts in pre|&s;erving, amid&s;t di&s;torted proportions and aggravated features, &s;ome di&s;tin|gui&s;hing likene&s;s of the per&s;on, but in &s;uch a manner as to transform the mo&s;t agreeable beauty into the mo&s;t odious mon&s;ter.</P>
<P>It is very di&s;ingenuous to level the be&s;t of mankind with the wor&s;t, and for the faults of particulars to degrade the whole &s;pecies. Such methods tend
<PB N="280" REF="308">
not only to remove a man's good opi|nion of others, but to de&s;troy that re|verence for him&s;elf, which is a great guard of innocence, and a &s;pring of virtue.</P>
<P>It is true indeed that there are &s;ur|prizing mixtures of beauty and defor|mity, of wi&s;dom and folly, virtue and vice in the human make; &s;uch a di&s;|parity is found among numbers of the &s;ame kind, and every individual, in &s;ome in&s;tances, or at &s;ome times, is &s;o unequal to him&s;elf, that <HI>man</HI> &s;eems to be the mo&s;t wavering and incon&s;i&s;tent Being in the whole Creation. So that the que&s;tion in morality, concerning the dignity of our nature, may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear like &s;ome difficult que|&s;tions in natural Philo&s;ophy, in which the arguments on both &s;ides &s;eem to be of equal &s;trength. But as I began with con&s;idering this point, as it re|lates to action, I &s;hall here borrow an admirable reflection from Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pa&s;cal,</HI> which I think &s;ets it in its pro|per light.</P>
<P><HI>It is of dangerous con&s;equence,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>to repre&s;ent to man how near he is to the level of bea&s;ts, without &s;hewing him at the
<PB N="281" REF="309">
&s;ame time his</HI> Greatne&s;s. <HI>It is likewi&s;e dangerous to let him &s;ee his</HI> Greatne&s;s <HI>without his</HI> Meanne&s;s. <HI>It is more dange|rous yet to leave him ignorant of either; but very beneficial that he &s;hould be made &s;en&s;ible of both.</HI> Whatever imperfecti|ons we may have in our nature, it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion and virtue to rectify them, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with our pre&s;ent &s;tate, In the mean time, it is no &s;mall encouragement to gene|rous minds to con&s;ider that we &s;hall put them all off with our mortality. That &s;ublime manner of &s;alutation with which the <HI>Jews</HI> approached their Kings,
<Q><HI>O King,</HI> live for ever!</Q>
may be addre&s;&s;ed to the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;pi&s;ed mortal among us, under all the infirmities and di&s;tre&s;&s;es with which we &s;ee him &s;urrounded. And whoever believes the <HI>Immortality of the Soul,</HI> will not need a better argument for the dignity of his nature, nor a &s;tronger incitement to actions &s;uitable to it.</P>
<P>I am naturally led by this reflection to a &s;ubject I have already touched up|on
<PB N="282" REF="310">
in a former letter, and cannot with|out plea&s;ure call to mind the thoughts of <HI>Cicero</HI> to this purpo&s;e, in the clo&s;e of his book concerning <HI>Old Age.</HI> Every one who is acquainted with his writings will remember that the elder <HI>Cato</HI> is introduced in that di&s;cour&s;e as the Speaker, and <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Lelius</HI> as his Auditors. This venerable per&s;on is re|pre&s;ented looking forward as it were from the verge of extreme old age, in|to a future &s;tate, and ri&s;ing into a con|templation on the unperi&s;hable part of his nature, and its exi&s;tence after death. I &s;hall collect part of his di&s;cour&s;e. And as you have formerly offered &s;ome arguments for the Soul's Immortality, agreeable both to rea&s;on and the Chri|&s;tian doctrine, I believe your readers will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee how the &s;ame great truth &s;hines in the pomp of <HI>Roman</HI> eloquence.</P>
<P>This, &s;ays <HI>Cato,</HI> is my firm, per&s;ua|&s;ion, that &s;ince the human Soul exerts it &s;elf with &s;o great activity, &s;ince it has &s;uch a remembrance of the Pa&s;t, &s;uch a concern for the Future, &s;ince it is en|riched with &s;o many arts, sciences, and di&s;coveries, it is impo&s;&s;ible but the
<PB N="283" REF="311">
Being which contains all the&s;e mu&s;t be Immortal.</P>
<P>The elder <HI>Cyrus,</HI> ju&s;t before his death, is repre&s;ented by XENOPHON &s;peaking after this manner.<Q REND="margQuotes">Think not, my deare&s;t Children, that when I depart from you I &s;hall be no more, but remember, that my Soul, even while I lived among you, was invi&s;ible to you; yet by my acti|ons you were &s;enfible it exi&s;ted in this body. Believe it therefore exi&s;ting &s;till, though it be &s;till un&s;een. How quickly would the honours of illu&s;trious men peri&s;h after death, if their Souls performed nothing to pre&s;erve their fame? For my own part, I could never think that the Soul while in a mortal body, lives; but when departed out of it, dies; or that its con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is lo&s;t when it is di&s;charged out of an uncon&s;cious habitation. But when it is freed from all corporeal al|liance, then it truly exi&s;ts. Further, &s;ince the human frame is broken by death, tell us what becomes of its parts? It is vi&s;ible whether the materials of other Beings are tran&s;lated, namely, to the &s;ource from whence they had their birth. The &s;oul a|lone, neither pre&s;ent nor departed, is the object of our eyes.</Q></P>

<P>The following que&s;tion is &s;tarted by one of the Schoolmen. Suppo&s;ing the whole body of the earth were a great ball or ma&s;s of the fine&s;t &s;and, and that a &s;ingle grain or particle of this &s;and &s;hould be annihilated every thou&s;and years. Suppo&s;ing then that you had it in your choice to be happy all the while this prodigious ma&s;s of &s;and was con&s;u|ming by this &s;low method 'till there was not a grain of it left, on condition you were to be mi&s;erable for ever after; or, &s;uppo&s;ing that you might be happy for ever after, on condition you would be mi&s;erable 'till the whole ma&s;s of &s;and were thus annihilated at the rate of one &s;and in
<PB N="290" REF="322">
a thou&s;and years: Which of the&s;e two ca&s;es would you make your choice?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed in this ca&s;e, &s;o many thou&s;ands of years are to the ima|gination as a kind of Eternity, tho' in reality they do not bear &s;o great a pro|portion to that duration which is to follow them, as an Unite does to the greate&s;t number which you can put together in figures, or as one of tho&s;e &s;ands to the &s;uppo&s;ed heap. Rea&s;on therefore tells us, without any manner of he&s;itation, which would be the better part in this choice. However, as I have before intimated, our rea&s;on might in &s;uch ca&s;e be &s;o over&s;et by the imagination, as to di&s;po&s;e &s;ome per&s;ons to &s;ink under the con&s;ideration of the great length of the fir&s;t part of this duration, and of the great di&s;tance of that &s;econd duration which is to &s;uc|ceed it. The mind, I &s;ay, might give it &s;elf up to that happine&s;s which is at hand, con&s;idering that it is &s;o very near, and that it would la&s;t &s;o very long. But when the choice we actually have before us is this, Whether we will chu&s;e to be happy for the &s;pace only of three&s;core and ten, nay perhaps of only twenty or ten years, I might &s;ay of only a day or
<PB N="291" REF="323">
an hour, and mi&s;erable to all eternity; or, on the contrary, mi&s;erable for this &s;hort term of years, and happy for a whole Eternity: What words are &s;uffi|cient to expre&s;s that folly and want of con&s;ideration which in &s;uch a ca&s;e makes a wrong choice?</P>
<P>I here put the ca&s;e even at the wor&s;t, by &s;uppo&s;ing (what &s;eldom happens) that a cour&s;e of virtue makes us mi&s;erable in this life: But if we &s;uppo&s;e (as it gene|rally happens) that virtue would make us more happy even in this life than a con|trary cour&s;e of vice; how can we &s;uffi|ciently admire the &s;tupidity or madne&s;s of tho&s;e per&s;ons who are capable of ma|king &s;o ab&s;urd a choice?</P>
<P>Every wi&s;e man therefore will con&s;i|der this life only as it may conduce to the happine&s;s of the other, and chearful|ly &s;acrifice the Plea&s;ures of a few years to tho&s;e of an Eternity.</P>

<P>THERE are none of your &s;pecu|lations which plea&s;e me more than tho&s;e upon Infinitude and Eternity. You have already con&s;idered that part of E|ternity which is pa&s;t, and I wi&s;h you would give us your thoughts upon that which is to come.</P>
<P>Your readers will perhaps receive greater plea&s;ure from this view of Eter|nity than the former, &s;ince we have every one of us a concern in that which is to come: Whereas a &s;pecula|tion on that which is pa&s;t is rather cu|rious than u&s;eful.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, we can ea&s;ily conceive it po&s;&s;ible for &s;ucce&s;&s;ive duration never to have an end; tho', as you have ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that Eternity which never had a beginning is altogether incom|prehen&s;ible; That is, we can conceive an eternal duration which <HI>may be,</HI> tho' we cannot an eternal duration which <HI>hath been</HI>; or, if I may u&s;e the philo&s;o|phical

terms, we may apprehend a <HI>po|tential</HI> though not an <HI>actual</HI> Eternity.</P>
<P>This notion of a future Eternity, which is natural to the mind of man, is an unan&s;werable argument that he is a Being de&s;igned for it: e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider that he is capable of being virtuous or vicious here; that he hath faculties improvable to all Eternity; and by a proper or wrong employ|ment of them, may be happy or mi&s;e|rable throughout that infinite duration. Our idea indeed of this Eternity is not of an adequate or fixed nature, but is perpetually growing and enlarging it|&s;elf toward the object, which is too big for human comprehen&s;ion. As we are now in the beginnings of Exi|&s;tence, &s;o &s;hall we always appear to our &s;elves as if we were for ever entring upon it.

<P>THE following E&s;&s;ay comes from the ingenious Author of the letter upon <HI>Novelty,</HI> printed in a late <HI>Spectator:</HI> The notions are drawn from the <HI>Platonick</HI> way of thinking, but as they contribute to rai&s;e the mind, and may in&s;pire noble &s;entiments of our own future grandeur and happine&s;s, I think it well de&s;erves to be pre&s;ented to the publick.</P>
<P>IF the univer&s;e be the creature of an In|telligent Mind, this Mind could have no immediate regard to him&s;elf in pro|ducing it. He needed not to make trial of his Omnipotence, to be informed what effects were within its reach: The world as exi&s;ting in his eternal idea was then as beautiful as now it is drawn forth in|to Being; and in the immen&s;e aby&s;s of
<PB N="295" REF="327">
his E&s;&s;ence are contained far brighter &s;cenes than will be ever &s;et forth to view; it being impo&s;&s;ible that the great Author of Nature &s;hould bound his own power by giving Exi&s;tence to a &s;y&s;tem of crea|tures &s;o perfect that he cannot improve upon it by any other exertions of his Al|mighty Will. Between finite and infi|nite there is an unmea&s;ured interval, not to be filled up in endle&s;s ages; for which rea&s;on, the mo&s;t excellent of all God's works mu&s;t be equally &s;hort of what his power is able to produce as the mo&s;t im|perfect, and may be exceeded with the &s;ame ea&s;e.</P>
<P>This thought hath made &s;ome ima|gine, (what, it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, is not impo&s;&s;ible) that the unfathomed &s;pace is ever teeming with new births, the youn|ger &s;till inheriting a greater perfection than the elder. But as this doth not fall within my pre&s;ent view, I &s;hall content my &s;elf with taking notice, that the con|&s;ideration now mentioned proves undeni|ably, that the ideal worlds in the Divine Under&s;tanding yield a pro&s;pect incom|parably more ample, various and delight|ful than any created world can do: And that therefore as it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="296" REF="328">
that God &s;hould make a world merely of inanimate matter, however diver&s;ified; or inhabited only by creatures of no higher an order than brutes; &s;o the end for which he de&s;igned his rea&s;onable off|&s;pring is the contemplation of his works, the enjoyment of him&s;elf, and in both to be happy, having, to this purpo&s;e, en|dowed them with corre&s;pondent facul|ties and de&s;ires. He can have no greater plea&s;ure from a bare review of his works, than from the &s;urvey of his own ideas, but we may be a&s;&s;ured that he is well plea&s;ed in the &s;atisfaction derived to Be|ings capable of it, and, for who&s;e enter|tainment, he hath erected this immen&s;e theatre. Is not this more than an inti|mation of our Immortality? Man, who when con&s;idered as on his probation for a happy Exi&s;tence hereafter is the mo&s;t remarkable in&s;tance of Divine Wi&s;dom; if we cut him off from all relation to E|ternity, is the mo&s;t wonderful and un|accountable compo&s;ition in the whole creation. He hath capacities to lodge a much greater variety of knowledge than he will be ever ma&s;ter of, and an un&s;atisfied curio&s;ity to tread the &s;ecret paths of nature and providence: But,
<PB N="297" REF="329">
with this, his organs, in their pre&s;ent &s;tructure, are rather fitted to &s;erve the nece&s;&s;ities of a vile body, than to mini|&s;ter to his under&s;tanding? and from the little &s;pot to which he is chained, he can frame but wandering gue&s;&s;es concerning the innumerable worlds of light that en|compa&s;s him, which, tho' in them&s;elves of a prodigious bigne&s;s, do but ju&s;t glimmer in the remote &s;paces of the hea|vens; and, when with a great deal of time and pains he hath laboured a little way up the &s;teep a&s;cent of truth, and beholds with pity the groveling multi|tude beneath, in a moment, his foot &s;lides, and he tumbles down headlong into the grave.</P>
<P>Thinking on this, I am obliged to be|lieve, in ju&s;tice to the Creator of the world, that there is another &s;tate when man &s;hall be better &s;ituated for contem|plation, or rather have it in his power to remove from object to object, and from world to world; and be accommo|dated with &s;en&s;es, and other helps, for making the quicke&s;t and mo&s;t amazing di&s;coveries. How doth &s;uch a genius as Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> from amid&s;t the darkne&s;s that involves human under|&s;tanding,
<PB N="298" REF="330">
break forth, and appear like one of another species! The va&s;t machine, we inhabit, lies open to him, he &s;eems not unacquainted with the general laws that govern it; and while with the tran|&s;port of a Philo&s;opher he beholds and admires the glorious work, he is capable of paying at once a more devout and more rational homage to his maker. But alas! how narrow is the pro&s;pect even of &s;uch a mind? and how ob&s;cure to the compa&s;s that is taken in by the ken of an Angel; or of a Soul but newly e&s;caped from its impri&s;onment in the bo|dy! For my part, I freely indulge my &s;oul in the confidence of its future gran|deur; it plea&s;es me to think that I who know &s;o &s;small a portion of the works of the Creator, and with &s;low and painful steps creep up and down on the &s;urface of this globe, &s;hall e'er long &s;hoot away with the &s;wiftne&s;s of imagination, trace out the hidden &s;prings of nature's ope|rations, be able to keep pace with the heavenly bodies in the rapidity of their career, be a spectator of the long chain of events in the natural and moral worlds, vi&s;it the &s;everal apartments of the crea|tion, know how they are furni&s;hed and
<PB N="299" REF="331">
how inhabited, comprehend the order, and mea&s;ure the magnitudes, and di&s;tan|ces of tho&s;e orbs, which to us &s;eem di&s;|po&s;ed without any regular de&s;ign, and &s;et all in the &s;ame circle; ob&s;erve the dependance of the parts of each &s;y&s;tem, and (if our minds are big enough to gra&s;p the theory) of the &s;everal &s;y&s;tems upon one another, from whence re&s;ults the harmony of the univer&s;e. In Eternity a great deal may be done of this kind. I find it of u&s;e to cheri&s;h this generous ambition; for be&s;ides the &s;ecret refre&s;h|ment it diffu&s;es through my &s;oul, it en|gages me in an endeavour to improve my faculties, as well as to exerci&s;e them conformably to the rank I now hold a|mong rea&s;onable Beings, and the hope I have of being once advanced to a more exalted &s;tation.</P>
<P>The other, and that the ultimate end of man, is the enjoyment of God, be|yond which he cannot form a wi&s;h. Dim at be&s;t are the conceptions we have of the Supreme Being, who, as it were, keeps his creatures in &s;u&s;pence, neither di&s;covering, nor hiding him&s;elf; by which means, the Libertine hath a handle to di&s;|pute his Exi&s;tence, while the mo&s;t are
<PB N="300" REF="332">
content to &s;peak him fair, but in their hearts prefer every trifling &s;atisfaction to the favour of their Maker, and ridicule the good man for the &s;ingularity of his choice. Will there not a time come, when the Free-thinker &s;hall &s;ee his im|pious &s;chemes overturned, and be made a convert to the truths he hates; when deluded mortals &s;hall be convinced of the folly of their pur&s;uits, and the few wi&s;e who followed the guidance of heaven, and, &s;corning the blandi&s;hments of &s;en&s;e and the &s;ordid bribery of the world, a&s;|pired to a cele&s;tial abode, &s;hall &s;tand po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of their utmo&s;t wi&s;h in the vi&s;ion of the Creator? Here the mind heaves a thought now and then towards him, and hath &s;ome tran&s;ient glances of his Pre|&s;ence: When, in the in&s;tant it thinks it &s;elf to have the fa&s;te&s;t hold, the object eludes its expectations, and it falls back tired and baffled to the ground. Doubt|le&s;s there is &s;ome more perfect way of conver&s;ing with heavenly Beings. Are not Spirits capable of mutual intelli|gence, unle&s;s immer&s;ed in bodies, or by their intervention? Mu&s;t &s;uperior natures depend on inferior for the main privi|lege of &s;ociable Beings, that of conver|&s;ing
<PB N="301" REF="333">
with them, and knowing each other? What would they have done, had mat|ter never been created? I &s;uppo&s;e, not have lived in eternal &s;olitude. As incor|poreal &s;ub&s;tances are of a nobler order, &s;o be &s;ure, their manner of intercour&s;e is an&s;werably more expedite and inti|mate. This method of communication, we call intellectual Vi&s;ion, as &s;omewhat analogous to the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, which is the medium of our acquaintance with this vi&s;ible world. And in &s;ome &s;uch way can God make him&s;elf the object of immediate intuition to the Ble&s;&s;ed; and as he can, 'tis not improbable that he will, always conde&s;cending, in the cir|cum&s;tances of doing it, to the weakne&s;s and proportion of finite minds. His works but faintly reflect the Image of his Perfections, 'tis a &s;econd-hand know|ledge: To have a ju&s;t idea of him, it may be nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;ee him as he is. But what is that? 'Tis &s;omething, that never entered into the heart of man to conceive; yet, what we can ea&s;i|ly conceive, will be a fountain of un|&s;peakable, of everla&s;ting rapture. All created glories will fade and die away in his Pre&s;ence. Perhaps it will be my hap|pine&s;s

<P>If any thing looks like a recompence of calamitous virtue on this &s;ide the grave, it is either an a&s;&s;urance that there|by we obtain the favour and protection of heaven, and &s;hall, whatever befalls us in this, in another life meet with a ju&s;t return; or el&s;e that applau&s;e and repu|tation, which is thought to attend vir|tuous actions.

The con&s;e|quence of which was, that they often pa&s;&s;ed wrong judgments. <HI>Pluto,</HI> there|fore, who pre&s;ided in <HI>Tartarus,</HI> and the Guardians of the ble&s;&s;ed I&s;lands, finding that on the other &s;ide many unfit per|&s;ons were &s;ent to their re&s;pective domi|nions, complain'd to <HI>Jove,</HI> who pro|mi&s;ed to redre&s;s the evil.

Hence many conceal the blemi&s;hes and imperfections of their minds by beauty, birth and riches; not to mention, that at the time of trial there are crowds of witne&s;&s;es to atte&s;t their having lived well.

the belief of what is &s;upernaturally re|vealed.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on blind and deaf from his birth, who being grown to man's e&s;tate, is by the Dead-pal&s;y, or &s;ome other cau&s;e, deprived of his Feel|ing, Ta&s;ting, and Smelling; and at the &s;ame time has the impediment of his Hearing removed, and the film taken from his eyes: What the five Sen&s;es are to us, that the Touch, Ta&s;te and Smell were to him. And any other ways of perception of a more refined and exten|&s;ive nature were to him as inconceivable, as to us tho&s;e are which will one day be adapted to perceive tho&s;e things which <HI>Eye hath not &s;een, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to con|ceive.</HI> And it would be ju&s;t as rea&s;on|able in him to conclude, that the lo&s;s of tho&s;e three Sen&s;es could not po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ucceeded by any new inlets of percep|tion; as in a modern <HI>Free-thinker</HI> to ima|gine there can be no &s;tate of life and per|ception without the Sen&s;es he enjoys at pre&s;ent.

gay and plea&s;ing objects, and his ears with a melodious con&s;ort of vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ick: Behold him ama|zed, ravi&s;hed, tran&s;ported; and you have &s;ome di&s;tant repre&s;entation, &s;ome faint and glimmering idea of the ec&s;tatic &s;tate of the Soul in that article in which &s;he emerges from this Sepulchre of fle&s;h into life and immortality.</P>

<P>THE &s;ame faculty of Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding, which placeth us above the Brute part of the Creation, doth al&s;o &s;ubject our minds to greater and more manifold di&s;quiets than crea|tures of an inferior rank are &s;en&s;ible of. It is by this that we anticipate future di&s;a&s;ters, and oft create to our&s;elves real pain from imaginary evils, as well as multiply the pangs ari&s;ing from tho&s;e which cannot be avoided.</P>
<P>It behoves us therefore to make the be&s;t u&s;e of that &s;ublime talent, which,
<PB N="310" REF="342">
&s;o long as it continues the in&s;trument of pa&s;&s;ion, will &s;erve only to make us more mi&s;erable, in proportion as we are more excellent than other Beings.</P>
<P>It is the privilege of a Thinking Be|ing to withdraw from the objects that &s;ollicit his &s;en&s;es, and turn his thoughts inward on him&s;elf. For my own part, I often mitigate the pain ari&s;ing from the little mi&s;fortunes and di&s;appoint|ments that chequer human life by this introver&s;ion of my faculties, wherein I regard my own Soul as the image of her Creator, and receive great con&s;ola|tion from beholding tho&s;e perfections which te&s;tify her Divine Original, and lead me into &s;ome knowledge of her e|verla&s;ting Archetype.</P>
<P>But there is not any property or cir|cum&s;tance of my Being that I contem|plate with more joy than my Immorta|lity. I can ea&s;ily overlook any pre&s;ent momentary &s;orrow, when I reflect that it is in my power to be happy a thou|&s;and years hence. If it were not for this thought, I had rather be an Oy&s;ter than a Man, the mo&s;t &s;tupid and &s;en&s;ele&s;s of animals than a rea&s;onable mind tortured
<PB N="311" REF="343">
with an extream innate de&s;ire of that perfection which it de&s;pairs to ob|tain.</P>
<P>It is with great plea&s;ure that I be|hold In&s;tinct, Rea&s;on and Faith con|curring to atte&s;t this comfortable truth. It is revealed from Heaven, it is di&s;co|vered by Philo&s;ophers, and the ignorant, unenlightened part of mankind have a natural propen&s;ity to believe it. It is an agreeable entertainment to reflect on the various &s;hapes under which this do|ctrine has appeared in the world. The <HI>Pythagorean</HI> tran&s;migration, the &s;en&s;ual habitations of the <HI>Mahometan,</HI> and the &s;hady realms of <HI>Pluto,</HI> do all agree in the main points, the continuation of our Exi&s;tence, and the di&s;tribution of rewards and puni&s;hments, proportioned to the merits or demerits of men in this life.</P>
<P>But in all the&s;e &s;chemes there is &s;ome|thing gro&s;s and improbable, that &s;hocks a rea&s;onable and &s;peculative mind. Where|as nothing can be more rational and &s;ub|lime than the Chri&s;tian idea of a future State. <HI>Eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of
<PB N="312" REF="344">
man to conceive the things which God hath prepared for tho&s;e that love him.</HI> The above-mentioned &s;chemes are narrow tran&s;cripts of our pre&s;ent &s;tate: But in this indefinite de&s;cription there is &s;omething ineffably great and noble. The mind of man mu&s;t be rai&s;ed to a higher pitch, not only to partake the enjoyments of the Chri&s;tian Paradi&s;e, but even to be able to frame any notion of them.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, in order to gratify our imagination, and by way of conde&s;cen|&s;ion to our low way of thinking, the Ideas of Light, Glory, a Crown, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are made u&s;e of to adumbrate that which we cannot directly under&s;tand. <HI>The Lamb which is in the mid&s;t of the throne &s;hall feed them, and &s;hall lead them into living fountains of waters; and God &s;hall wipe a|way all tears from their eyes. And there &s;hall be no more death, neither &s;orrow, nor crying, neither &s;hall there be any more pain; for the former things are pa&s;&s;ed away, and behold all things are new. There &s;hall be no night there, and they need no candle, neither light of the &s;un: for the Lord God giveth them light, and &s;hall make them
<PB N="313" REF="345">
drink of the river of his plea&s;ures: and they &s;hall reign for ever and ever. They &s;hall receive a crown of glory which fadeth not away.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are chearing reflections: And I have often wondered that men could be found &s;o dull and phlegmatick, as to prefer the thought of annihilation before them; or &s;o ill-natur'd, as to endeavour to per&s;uade mankind to the disbelief of what is &s;o plea&s;ing and profitable even in the pro&s;pect; or &s;o blind, as not to &s;ee that there is a Deity, and if there be, that this &s;cheme of things flows from his attributes, and evidently corre|&s;ponds with the other parts of his cre|ation.</P>
<P>I know not how to account for this ab&s;urd turn of thought, except it pro|ceed from a want of other employment joined with an affectation of &s;ingularity. I &s;hall, therefore, inform our modern <HI>Free-thinkers</HI> of two points, whereof they &s;eem to be ignorant. The fir&s;t is, that it is not the being &s;ingular, but be|ing &s;ingular for &s;omething that argues either extraordinary endowments of na|ture, or benevolent intentions to man|kind,
<PB N="314" REF="346">
which draws the admiration and e&s;teem of the world. A mi&s;take in this point naturally ari&s;es from that con|fu&s;ion of thought which I do not re|member to have &s;een &s;o great in&s;tances of in any Writers, as in certain modern <HI>Free-Thinkers.</HI></P>
<P>The other point is, that there are innumerable objects within the reach of a human mind, and each of the&s;e objects may be viewed in innumerable lights and po&s;itions, and the relations ari&s;ing between them are innumerable. There is, therefore, an infinity of things whereon to employ their thoughts, if not with advantage to the world, at lea&s;t with amu&s;ement to them&s;elves, and without offence or prejudice to other people. If they proceed to exert their talent of <HI>Free-thinking</HI> in this way; they may be innocently dull, and no one take any notice of it. But to &s;ee men with|out either Wit or Argument pretend to run down Divine and Human Laws, and treat their fellow-&s;ubjects with con|tempt for profe&s;&s;ing a belief of tho&s;e points on which the pre&s;ent as well as future intere&s;t of Mankind depends, is
<PB N="315" REF="347">
not to be endured. For my own part, I &s;hall omit no endeavours to render their per&s;ons as de&s;picable, and their practices as odious, in the eye of the world, as they de&s;erve.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE indi&s;po&s;ition which has long hung upon me, is at la&s;t grown to &s;uch a head, that it mu&s;t quickly
<PB N="317" REF="349">
make an end of me, or of it &s;elf. You may imagine, that whil&s;t I am in this bad &s;tate of health, there are none of your works which I read with greater plea&s;ure than your <HI>Saturday</HI>'s papers. I &s;hould be very glad if I could fur|ni&s;h you with any hints for that day's entertainment.

<P>Among all the reflections which u|&s;ually ri&s;e in the mind of a &s;ick man, who has time and inclination to con|&s;ider his approaching end, there is none more natural than that of his going to appear naked and unbodied before Him who made him. When a man con&s;iders, that as &s;oon as the vital union is di&s;&s;olved, he &s;hall &s;ee that Supreme Being, whom he now con|templates at a di&s;tance, and only in his works; or, to &s;peak more philo|&s;ophically, when by &s;ome faculty in the Soul he &s;hall apprehend the Di|vine
<PB N="318" REF="350">
Being, and be more &s;en&s;ible of his Pre&s;ence, than we are now of the Pre&s;ence of any object which the eye beholds, a man mu&s;t be lo&s;t in care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s and &s;tupidity, who is not a|larmed at &s;uch a thought. Dr. <HI>Sher|lock,</HI> in his excellent treati&s;e upon death, has repre&s;ented, in very &s;trong and lively colours, the &s;tate of the Soul in its fir&s;t &s;eparation from the Body, with regard to that invi&s;ible world which every where &s;urrounds us, tho' we are not able to di&s;cover it through this gro&s;&s;er world of matter, which is accommodated to our &s;en&s;es in this life. His words are as follow.</P>
<P>That death, which is our leaving this world, is nothing el&s;e but our putting off the&s;e bodies, teaches us, that it is only our union to the&s;e bodies, which intercepts the &s;ight of the other world: The other world is not at &s;uch a di&s;tance from us, as we may imagine; the throne of God indeed is at a great remove from this earth, above the third heavens, where he di&s;plays his glory to tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Spirits which encompa&s;s his throne; but as &s;oon
<PB N="319" REF="351">
as we &s;tep out of the&s;e bodies, we &s;tep into the other world, which is not &s;o pro|perly another world, (for there is the &s;ame heaven and earth &s;till) as a new &s;tate of life. To live in the&s;e bodies is to live in this world; to live out of them is to remove into the next: For while our Souls are confined to the&s;e bodies, and can look only through the&s;e material ca&s;e|ments, nothing but what is material can affect us; nay, nothing but what is &s;o gro&s;s, that it can reflect light, and con|vey the &s;hapes and colours of things with it to the eye: So that though within this vi&s;ible world, there be a more glorious &s;cene of things than what appears to us, we perceive nothing at all of it; for this veil of fle&s;h parts the vi&s;ible and in|vi&s;ible world: But when we put off the&s;e bodies, there are new and &s;urpri|zing wonders pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our views; when the&s;e material &s;pectacles are taken off, the Soul, with its own naked eyes, &s;ees what was invi&s;ible before: And then we are in the other world, when we can &s;ee it, and conver&s;e with it: Thus St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, That <HI>when we are at home in the body,, we are ab&s;ent from
<PB N="320" REF="352">
the Lord; but when we are ab&s;ent from the body, we are pre&s;ent with the Lord, 2</HI> Cor. <HI>5.6, 8.</HI> And me|thinks this is enough to cure us of our fondne&s;s for the&s;e bodies, unle&s;s we think it more de&s;irable to be confined to a pri|&s;on, and to look through a grate all our lives, which gives us but a very narrow pro&s;pect, and that none of the be&s;t neither, than to be &s;et at liberty to view all the glories of the world. What would we give now for the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of that in|vi&s;ible world, which the fir&s;t &s;tep we take out of the&s;e bodies will pre&s;ent us with? There are &s;uch things <HI>as eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to con|ceive:</HI> Death opens our eyes, enlarges our pro&s;pect, pre&s;ents us with a new and more glorious world, which we can never &s;ee while we are &s;hut up in fle&s;h; which &s;hould make us as willing to part with this veil, as to take the film off our eyes, which hinders our &s;ight.</P>
<P>As a thinking man cannot but be very much affected with the idea of his appearing in the Pre&s;ence of that
<PB N="321" REF="353">
Being <HI>whom none can &s;ee and live</HI>; he mu&s;t be much more affected when he con&s;iders that this Being whom he appears before, will examine all the actions of his pa&s;t life, and reward or puni&s;h him accordingly. I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s that I think there is no &s;cheme of Religion, be&s;ides that of Chri&s;ti|anity, which can po&s;&s;ibly &s;upport the mo&s;t virtuous per&s;on under this thought.

<P>THE pro&s;pect of death is &s;o gloomy and di&s;mal, that if it were con|&s;tantly before our eyes, it would imbit|ter all the &s;weets of life. The gracious Author of our Being hath therefore &s;o formed us, that we are capable of ma|ny plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations and reflections,
<PB N="224" REF="356">
and meet with &s;o many amu&s;ements and &s;olicitudes, as divert our thoughts from dwelling upon an evil, which by rea|&s;on of its &s;eeming di&s;tance, makes but languid impre&s;&s;ions upon the mind. But how di&s;tant &s;oever the time of our death may be, &s;ince it is certain that we mu&s;t die, it is nece&s;&s;ary to allot &s;ome portion of our life to con&s;ider the end of it; and it is highly convenient to fix &s;ome &s;tated times to meditate upon the final period of our Exi&s;tence here. The prin|ciple of &s;elf-love, as we are men, will make us enquire, what is like to be|come of us after our di&s;&s;olution? and our con&s;cience, as we are Chri&s;tians, will inform us, that according to the good or evil of our actions here, we &s;hall be tran&s;lated to the man&s;ions of eternal bli&s;s or mi&s;ery. When this is &s;eriou&s;ly weighed, we mu&s;t think it madne&s;s to be unprepared again&s;t the black mo|ment; but when we reflect that perhaps that black moment may be to-night, how watchful ought we to be!</P>
<P>I was wonderfully affected with a di&s;|cour&s;e I had lately with a Clergyman of my acquaintance upon this head,
<PB N="325" REF="357">
which was to this effect:
<Q REND="margQuotes">The con&s;i|deration, &s;aid the good man, that my Being is precarious, moved me many years ago to make a re&s;olution, which I have diligently kept, and to which I owe the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction that a mortal man can enjoy. Every night before I addre&s;s my &s;elf in private to my Creator, I lay my hand upon my heart, and ask my &s;elf, Whether if God &s;hould require my Soul of me this night, I could hope for mercy from him? The bitter agonies I un|derwent, in this my fir&s;t acquaintance with my &s;elf, were &s;o far from throw|ing me into de&s;pair of that mercy which is over all God's works, that they rather proved motives to greater circum&s;pection in my future conduct. The oftner I exerci&s;ed my &s;elf in me|ditations of this kind, the le&s;s was my anxiety; and by making the thoughts of death familiar, what was at fir&s;t &s;o terrible and &s;hocking is become the &s;weete&s;t of my enjoyments. The&s;e con|templations have indeed made me &s;e|rious, but not &s;ullen; nay, they are &s;o far from having &s;our'd my temper
<PB N="326" REF="358">
that as I have a mind perfectly com|po&s;ed, and a &s;ecret &s;pring of joy in my heart, &s;o my conver&s;ation is plea|&s;ant, and my countenance &s;erene.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU formerly ob&s;erved to me, that nothing made a more ridiculous figure in a man's life, than the di&s;pari|ty we often find in him &s;ick and well. Thus one of an unfortunate con&s;titu|tion is perpetually exhibiting a mi&s;era|ble example of the weakne&s;s of his Mind, or of his Body, in their turns. I have had frequent opportunities of late to con&s;ider my &s;elf in the&s;e different views, and hope I have received &s;ome advantage by it. If what Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> &s;ays be true, that
<Q><L>The Soul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,</L>

Then &s;urely &s;ickne&s;s, contributing no le&s;s than old-age to the &s;haking down this &s;caffolding of the body, may di&s;|cover the inclo&s;ed &s;tructure more plainly. Sickne&s;s is a &s;ort of early old-age; it teaches us a diffidence in our earthly &s;tate, and in&s;pires us with the thoughts of a future, better than a thou&s;and volumes of Philo&s;ophers and
<PB N="328" REF="360">
Divines. It gives &s;o warning a con|cu&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e props of our vanity, our &s;trength and youth, that we think of fortifying our &s;elves within, when there is &s;o little dependance on our out-works. Youth, at the very be&s;t, is but a betrayer of human life in a gentler and &s;moother manner than age: 'Tis like a &s;tream that nou|ri&s;hes a plant upon its bank, and cau&s;es it to flouri&s;h and blo&s;&s;om to the &s;ight, but at the &s;ame time is undermining it at the root in &s;ecret. My youth has dealt more fairly and openly with me; it has afforded &s;everal pro|&s;pects of my danger, and given me an advantage not very common to young men, that the attractions of the world have not dazzled me very much; and I began where mo&s;t people end, with a full conviction of the emptine&s;s of all &s;orts of ambition, and the un&s;a|tisfactory nature of all human plea|&s;ures.</P>
<P>When a &s;mart fit of &s;ickne&s;s tells me this &s;curvy tenement of my body will fall in a little time, I am e'en as unconcerned as was that hone&s;t <HI>Hiber|nian,</HI>

When I reflect what an incon&s;iderable little atome every &s;ingle man is, with re|&s;pect to the whole creation, methinks 'tis a &s;hame to be concerned at the removal of &s;uch a trivial animal as I am.
