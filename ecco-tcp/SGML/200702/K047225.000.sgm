<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE general &s;cope of the following publi|cation has been already intimated in the Preface to a former collection of po&s;thumous Tracts by the &s;ame illu&s;trious author. It carries forward the &s;eries of Mr. Burke's opinions relative to our dome&s;tick parties, from the "Appeal to the old Whigs" in 1791, which is contained in the quarto edition of his works, to the Letter which he publi&s;hed in 1796, on occa&s;ion of the attack made upon him by the Duke of Bedford.</P>
<P>The principal piece, indeed, (in magnitude certainly, though perhaps not in temporary in|tere&s;t, the principal) is not altogether new.
<PB N="vi" REF="3">
The "Ob&s;ervations on the Conduct of the Minority in the Se&s;&s;ion of 1793," were &s;urrep|titiou&s;ly printed at the beginning of the pre&s;ent year; but, as it u&s;ually happens with &s;uch frauds, in a very mangled &s;tate, under a fal&s;e title, and without the real letter to the Duke of Portland, which &s;hould have been prefixed.</P>
<P>The paper it&s;elf was of the mo&s;t private kind. It was not intended to come at any time, and under any circum&s;tances, to the view of the publick. Mr. Burke wrote it as his ju&s;tification to the two noble heads of his party, for &s;eeming to take (he did not in reality take) a different &s;ide from them, when he acted on their own principles with more prompt and vigorous de|ci&s;ion, than they believed their duty at that time required them to do. He was &s;en&s;ible, that in its &s;tyle, it was not wholly free from the in|fluence of re&s;entment, though &s;uch as he deli|berately believed to be ju&s;t. He knew that the &s;harpne&s;s of his fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions was vi&s;ible on
<PB N="vii" REF="4">
it; but he knew al&s;o to whom it was to be con|fided. He was to be judged by two of the mo&s;t candid minds which the earth ever bore; men, who through the whole cour&s;e of his political life, had given him indubitable proofs of an unbounded affection, tru&s;t, and veneration. Nor was the paper to be &s;een by them till <Q REND="inline">"a mo|ment of compul&s;ory reflexion,"</Q> when it could not operate to the injury of any man, and would find in their bo&s;oms &s;omething congenial with his feelings, when he wrote it. Clearly fore|&s;eeing that the di&s;&s;imilarity of their views mu&s;t ultimately force them to a &s;eparation from Mr. Fox, he depo&s;ited it with the elder of his noble friends, de&s;iring that it might not be opened till after that event. Of this confidential Memorial he never had a &s;econd copy made; but he did keep a copy of the Letter which accompanied it to the Duke of Portland, as a &s;hort &s;ummary, containing all the principle and general &s;enti|ment, without the nece&s;&s;arily invidious details, of his other more &s;olemn Prote&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="5">
About two years after, he ca&s;ually learned from a friend, that the rough draft of the "Ob&s;ervations" &s;till exi&s;ted in the hands of the per&s;on whom he had employed to tran&s;cribe it. He immediately expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t anxiety to get it back. It was accordingly &s;urrendered, with an a&s;&s;urance that no copy of it had been taken, and was immediately de&s;troyed. A copy however, has &s;ince been publi&s;hed in the man|ner above related, by the very per&s;on who gave that a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>What Mr. Burke felt on receiving intelligence of the injury thus done him by one, from whom his kindne&s;s de&s;erved a very different return, will be be&s;t conveyed in his own words. The following is an extract of a Letter to a Friend, which he dictated on this &s;ubject from a &s;ick|bed: the re&s;t of the Letter entirely relates to a law-&s;uit which he was then carrying on to obtain redre&s;s again&s;t another kindred fraud.</P>

<SALUTE>"MY DEAR ********,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"ON the appearance of the Adverti&s;ement, all New&s;papers, and all letters have been kept back from me till this time. Mrs. Burke opened yours, and finding that all the mea|&s;ures in the power of Dr. King, your&s;elf, and Mr. Woodford, had been taken to &s;uppre&s;s the publication, &s;he ventured to deliver me the letters of to-day, which were read to me in my bed, about two o'clock.</P>
<P>"This affair does vex me; but I am not in a &s;tate of health at pre&s;ent to be deeply vexed at any thing. Wherever this matter comes into di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, I authori&s;e you to contradict the infamous reports, which (I am informed) have been given out; that this paper had been circulated through the Mini&s;try, and was intended gradually to &s;lide into the pre&s;s. To the be&s;t of my recollection, I never had
<PB N="x" REF="7">
a clean copy of it but one, which is now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; I never communicated that, but to the Duke of Portland, from whom I had it back again. But the Duke will &s;et this matter to rights, if in reality there were two copies and he has one. I never &s;hewed it, as they know, to any one of the Mini&s;try. If the Duke has really a copy, I believe his and mine are the only ones that exi&s;t, except what was taken by fraud from loo&s;e and in|correct papers by S****, to whom I gave the letter to copy. As &s;oon as I began to &s;u&s;pect him capable of any &s;uch &s;candalous breach of tru&s;t, you know with what anxiety I got the loo&s;e papers out of his hands, not having rea&s;on to think that he kept any other. Neither do I believe in fact (unle&s;s he medi|tated this villainy long ago) that he did, or does now po&s;&s;e&s;s any clean copy. I never communicated that paper to any out of the very &s;mall circle of tho&s;e private friends, from whom I concealed nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="8">
"But I beg you and my friends to be cautious how you let it be under&s;tood, that I di&s;claim any thing but the mere act and intention of publication. I do not retract any one of the &s;entiments contained in that Memorial, which was and is my ju&s;tification, addre&s;&s;ed to the friends, for who&s;e u&s;e alone I intended it. Had I de&s;igned it for the publick, I &s;hould have been more exact and full. It was written in a tone of indignation, in con&s;equence of the re&s;olutions of the Whig Club, which were directly pointed again&s;t my&s;elf and others, and occa&s;ioned our &s;ece&s;&s;ion from that Club; which is the la&s;t act of my life that I &s;hall under any circum&s;tances repent. Many temperaments and explanations there would have been, if ever I had a notion that it &s;hould meet the publick eye."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The moral &s;en&s;e of mankind on this occa|&s;ion, ran along with the authority of the Law, in endeavouring to defeat the mercenary &s;pecu|lations
<PB N="xii" REF="9">
of &s;o aggravated a fraud; yet not le&s;s than three thou&s;and copies of the pamphlet are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;old in the three kingdoms. It was reprinted both in Scotland and Ireland, retailed and commented upon in New&s;papers, noticed in Reviews, and quoted in the Hou&s;e of Commons, as Mr. Burke's. The very injunction which i&s;&s;ued again&s;t it from the Court of Chancery, authenticated it. Mr. Burke him&s;elf, whenever he was a&s;ked, as he frequently was at Bath, con&s;tantly gave in &s;ub&s;tance the explanation which is contained in the foregoing letter. In this account, indeed, there was one trifling mi&s;take. The &s;ingle fair copy, which he had received back from the Duke of Portland, was not in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: it was, where it &s;till remains, in the hands of his other noble friend, to whom it was jointly ad|dre&s;&s;ed. Probably he afterwards recollected the circum&s;tance, as, at his lei&s;ure, he corrected, with his own hand, one of the printed copies. But no e&s;&s;ential change of any kind could
<PB N="xiii" REF="10">
now be made. The mi&s;chief which had been done in a &s;ingle day, by the di&s;hone&s;ty of one man, was irreparable.</P>
<P>Had it been po&s;&s;ible to have let the paper &s;leep in total &s;ilence, the friends of the author might have he&s;itated to give a genuine edition. But no man in the lea&s;t acquainted with the literary hi&s;tory of this century, or even of our own times, could, for a moment, entertain any &s;uch hope. After the lap&s;e of years, &s;ometimes inqui&s;itive malice, &s;ometimes officious zeal, in this in&s;tance the cold pedantry of poring curi|o&s;ity, in that ca&s;e the imaginary triumph of di&s;|covering &s;ome hidden value in things which others had pa&s;&s;ed over with neglect, have brought again to light productions, which had dropped without a name from the pre&s;s, which had never excited general attention, and which the mature judgment of the writers had wi&s;hed for ever to abandon. How then could it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a tract, avowed to be Mr. Burke's
<PB N="xiv" REF="11">
at the period of his proude&s;t eminence, which had circulated &s;o widely, and in it&s;elf abounded with hi&s;torical matter, would not be received, with all its imperfections on its head, into future collections of his works? Nothing remained, therefore, but to publi&s;h it in a le&s;s mutilated form; to re&s;tore the true title, which had been malignantly fal&s;ified; and to add the introductory letter, which, if it had originally been given, might have repre&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the murmurs di&s;|tingui&s;hable in the half-&s;tifled cry, that was be|ginning to ri&s;e on the appearance of the &s;purious edition.</P>
<P>The &s;econd piece in this publication, though it has never hitherto been in print, was written with a view to the pre&s;s. It was occa&s;ioned by a &s;peech of a noble Duke, on the 8th of May, 1795, in the debate on the recall of Lord Fitzwilliam. It is in the epi&s;tolary form, and is addre&s;&s;ed to a gentleman, of whom Mr. Burke always ju&s;tly entertained a very
<PB N="xv" REF="12">
high opinion, and who&s;e merit has &s;ince recom|mended him, honourably for him&s;elf, and benefi|cially, it is hoped, for the &s;ervice of the empire, to an important &s;ituation in the &s;i&s;ter kingdom. From an an&s;wer of the mo&s;t flowing gaiety to the at|tack which had been made upon him, he pa&s;&s;es to the exultations of the republican faction over him, on account of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's defec|tion from the common cau&s;e, whom he treats him&s;elf with &s;evere plea&s;antry and dignified ridi|cule. He then proceeds more &s;eriou&s;ly to com|plain of the difficulties impo&s;ed by governments and the higher orders of &s;ociety on all who di&s;|intere&s;tedly &s;truggle to &s;upport, defend, and &s;ave them amid&s;t the perils of the pre&s;ent cri&s;is: he exhibits a beautiful picture of the &s;tate of Europe the day before the revolution in France: in a &s;ublime &s;train of morality, he developes the pure and exalted motives of his own actions; and avows his de&s;pair of our &s;afety from either of the two great parties, which domineer in the councils, and divide the opinions, of the na|tion.
<PB N="xvi" REF="13">
Nothing, perhaps, that ever came from his pen, would have placed him per&s;onally in a more elevated point of view; but his own indi|vidual glory was ever the lea&s;t of his cares. The &s;peech, which gave ri&s;e to it, having been &s;oon forgotten, this letter was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. And it may not be impertinent to remark, that the &s;ame had nearly been the fate of the eloquent performance, which he publi&s;hed the following year, on a &s;imilar provocation from the Duke of Bedford. He had determined to have forty copies only taken for his own u&s;e, and the pre&s;s broken up; when Lord Lauderdale, by a no|tice in the Hou&s;e of Peers, revived the &s;ubject of the grants, which his Sovereign had been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to confer upon Mr. Burke, in reward of his long, laborious, and &s;plendid &s;ervices.</P>
<P>His rupture with the Minority, which, till the &s;e&s;&s;ion of 1793, was never con&s;idered on his part as final and irreconcileable, drew down
<PB N="xvii" REF="14">
upon him much obloquy and reproach. He was loudly charged with a dereliction of all his publick principles, with infidelity to his party, and with a violation of private friend&s;hip. On the other hand, for the di&s;&s;atisfaction which he early intimated, and which he began from 1795 more decidedly to entertain, at the mea&s;ures of Government, he has not e&s;caped the imputation of ingratitude. The&s;e are heavy accu&s;ations; though all do not pre&s;s with equal weight upon his memory. It is the fir&s;t prai&s;e of moral wi&s;dom to know the ju&s;t time and place of each re&s;pective virtue. The be&s;t motives of human actions may lo&s;e not only their proper grace, but their very nature; they may become crimes, if they are not &s;uch as are &s;uited to the occa&s;ion. Happily for the infirmity of our kind in mo&s;t ca&s;es the choice is &s;imple; it is between po&s;itive right and po&s;itive wrong. There are &s;ituations, however (and the pre&s;ent is a &s;ea&s;on full of them) which make it nece&s;&s;ary for us to di&s;tingui&s;h more nicely; which leave us only an alternative
<PB N="xviii" REF="15">
of difficulties between evil and evil, and a painful choice among conflicting virtues. In free &s;tates, the union of publick men in a common cau&s;e cannot be too much re&s;pected and cheri&s;hed; for without the combined efforts of many, who think alike of the commonwealth, the pure&s;t and be&s;t publick principles can &s;eldom, if ever, prevail. We &s;hould endeavour to &s;trengthen publick connexion by private friend&s;hip; for without the cohe&s;ion of that attraction, without the charm of that endearment which winds it&s;elf round the heart, the bond of party would be found, &s;ometimes a loo&s;e and weak, &s;ometimes a fretting and galling tie. Neither is it to be doubted that we owe a liberal attachment and &s;upport, to the power of tho&s;e from whom we have con&s;ented to accept benefits, and by whom, on the &s;ure&s;t evidence of our own experience, if we mean not to confe&s;s our&s;elves utterly un|worthy, we mu&s;t believe that power to be well and laudably exerci&s;ed. To gratitude, to friend|&s;hip, to party, we ought cheerfully to yield
<PB N="xix" REF="16">
every inferior opinion on every collateral and &s;ubordinate que&s;tion: within tho&s;e limits they have lawful dominion: but to require that to them we &s;hould &s;urrender our deliberate judge|ment, and &s;ettled conviction on a &s;y&s;tem of fundamental policy, which involves the leading intere&s;ts, the &s;afety, or the honour of our country, what is it, but in the name of virtue to preach up con&s;piracy and corruption? All the other &s;ocial charities are &s;wallowed up and lo&s;t in the comprehen&s;ive relation of our country. For her they exi&s;t; by her we are protected in the enjoyment of them; to her they ought, on grave and con&s;cientious rea&s;ons, to be &s;acrificed. Her danger may call upon us to do what touches us &s;till more nearly. It may be our duty to re|view, perhaps to remodel, our very principles. New and unfore&s;een circum&s;tances may teach us the errour of conclu&s;ions which were formed with &s;ufficient accuracy for general application to ordinary times. Con&s;i&s;tency, however, is the fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umption both of integrity
<PB N="xx" REF="17">
and wi&s;dom. Sudden and great changes in the &s;y&s;tem of thinking and acting, &s;hake the cha|racter of the man to the foundation. He who has broken with all his publick and private friends, may have been uniformly right. He is at i&s;&s;ue with them on equal terms, before his country, the world, and po&s;terity. There is only their authority again&s;t his, and authority is not e&s;timated by mere numbers. But he who is avowedly incon&s;i&s;tent, puts him&s;elf at once on his defence, and &s;ets out with an admi&s;&s;ion again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke &s;o felt it. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Strip him of his con&s;i&s;tency," &s;aid he, &s;peaking of him&s;elf in his Appeal, "and you leave him naked indeed."</Q> It was to the charge on that particular head, that he more di&s;tinctly applied his an&s;wer; yet profe&s;&s;ing to adduce only &s;ome few, among many, of his former declarations, which he thought in uni&s;on with his view of the French Revolution. The perfect, and perhaps &s;ingu|lar, con&s;i&s;tency of his character, can only be
<PB N="xxi" REF="18">
fully known, when the publick &s;hall have be|fore them the documents of his mo&s;t &s;ecret motives and confidential coun&s;els; which, during a very important epoch, from the year 1766 to the end of the American war, have been fortu|nately di&s;covered more entire, than his friends had dared to hope. For the pre&s;ent, it will be &s;ufficient to give a &s;light outline of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in his political life, and of his early principles, as introductory to the particular occa&s;ions of the pieces which are compri&s;ed in this publication. This will incidentally afford &s;ome te&s;t of all the charges.</P>
<P>Nine and twenty years of an exi&s;tence, not prolonged to a very advanced age, he devoted with unremitting zeal to the &s;ervice of his country. During all that period, he never acted but with one party, which he always believed to be, in all its &s;uperiour members, the pure&s;t that our hi&s;tory can &s;hew. When he came a new man among them, he at once proved him&s;elf worthy of their confidence. He declined taking

any &s;alary for his employment under Lord Rockingham, as Secretary to the fir&s;t Lord of the Trea&s;ury; and, at his own co&s;t, he obtained a &s;eat in parliament to defend their mea&s;ures. Chance fir&s;t led him to that connexion; but when it was &s;oon after di&s;&s;olved, he entered into it a &s;econd time from choice, even again&s;t the affectionate remon&s;trances of &s;ome of the leaders in it, who pre&s;&s;ed him to follow without regard to them, the ea&s;y path, which his great re|putation had already opened before him to power and fortune.</P>
<P>The &s;acrifices which he made to that con|nexion, are little known. He never boa&s;ted of them, nor voluntarily &s;uffered any friend of his to blazon them. He regarded them but as ordinary acts of duty. Indeed, though not in&s;en&s;ible to &s;ober and judicious prai&s;e, he was &s;o abhorrent from that artificial fame, which is made and unmade at plea&s;ure in our popular journals, that he &s;hunned the mo&s;t di&s;tant ap|pearance
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22">
of being gratified by it, with &s;crupulous &s;olicitude. He re&s;trained all, over whom he had any influence, even from refuting the ab&s;urd calumnies, of which he was perpetually the object. His old ma&s;ter, companion, and friend (for he was all the&s;e) did not go without a reprimand from him for revealing, with &s;ome degree of innocent pride, the real place of his education, in contradiction to the &s;illy tale of his having been bred in France. He was daily vilified as an ob&s;cure and needy adventurer, yet he did not tell, what he had in his hands the means of &s;ub&s;tantiating, that he was &s;prung from a family anciently ennobled in &s;everal of its branches, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an ample e&s;tate, which his grandfather had actually enjoyed; nor that he had him&s;elf &s;unk a hand&s;ome competency in his adherence to his party. Once, and but once, in debate, he was provoked to declare his private circum&s;tances. It was in an&s;wer to a coar&s;e aggre&s;&s;ion. He &s;aid, that by the death of a brother, whom he loved and lamented, he had &s;ucceeded to upwards of &pound;.20,000; part of
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23">
which he had &s;pent, and the re&s;t then remained to be &s;pent in the independent &s;upport of his principles. In truth, without a &s;ingle per&s;onal extravagance, he did &s;pend that, and con&s;ider|ably more, of his own, chiefly derived from a &s;ource, which Cicero e&s;teemed the mo&s;t honour|able to him&s;elf, the la&s;t remembrances of dying friend&s;hip. This was not, on his part, a &s;pecula|tion from which he had formed hopes that de|ceived him. He repeatedly proclaimed to the world, that he knew the road which he had taken, was not the way to preferment.</P>
<P>The advantages which offered them&s;elves, he was not eager to improve, when he might with unfullied honour. Early in his oppo&s;i|tion to Lord North, the ruling Directors of the Ea&s;t-India Company, wi&s;hing to &s;top a po|pular cry, and to take from Government the be&s;t plea for intermeddling in their affairs, propo&s;ed to &s;end Mr. Burke, on his own terms, at the head of a commi&s;&s;ion to reform the abu&s;es of the Ea&s;t. Some of the corre&s;pondence on this occa&s;ion is
<PB N="xxv" REF="24">
&s;till extant. He re&s;olved not to go, actually refu&s;ed the appointment, and then, not before, acquainted Lord Rockingham with his deter|mination. At &s;everal &s;ub&s;equent junctures he might readily have commanded, in other arrangements, much higher &s;ituations than he ever held, or expected to hold, with his own party. The only office which he ever did hold, he took with the intention of reforming. Under the old Con&s;titution of that office every Pay|ma&s;ter-General was nece&s;&s;arily, for a time, <Q REND="inline">"the defaulter of unaccounted millions."</Q> He could not be admitted, however ready, to make up his accounts, till tho&s;e of all his predece&s;&s;ors had been clo&s;ed; and he was obliged to have in his hands large advances, to an&s;wer the drafts of the inferior payma&s;ters. Mr. Burke, from the circum&s;tances of the period when he came into his office, had he kept it on its old footing, might have been rich in the publick money. He might, with certainty and &s;afety, have re|alized (and it was actually &s;ugge&s;ted to him, how he might fairly realize) more than the value,
<PB N="xxvi" REF="25">
many times told, of all the grants which he ul|timately received from the Royal Bounty. But by a law, of which he was the author, and which has &s;ince been imitated in the payment of the navy, he changed the mode of the office, and, when he re&s;igned it, clo&s;ed his accounts.</P>
<P>On &s;ome of the occa&s;ions above related, he re&s;i&s;ted the temptations, not of avarice only, but of ambition; a pa&s;&s;ion much more difficult for a &s;tate&s;man to &s;ubdue. How exempt he was from the latter vice, he &s;till more clearly &s;hewed in another in&s;tance. From what he thought his duty, and for the general good of his party, he declined a &s;tation, which he might have been mo&s;t expected to covet: on the death of Mr. Dowde&s;well, he was pre&s;&s;ed to become the leader of his friends in the Hou&s;e of Commons, but he would not con&s;ent. It was his &s;y&s;tematick opi|nion, that before any man &s;hould a&s;pire &s;o high, he ought to have ca&s;t his root more broadly, and driven it more deeply, than he had him&s;elf then
<PB N="xxvii" REF="26">
done, into the &s;oil of the country. Po&s;terity may lament his virtuous delicacy.</P>
<P>Mr. Fox, at that period, generally voted on the &s;ame &s;ide, but was not yet directly connected with the party of Lord Rockingham. He had, from his childhood, been acquainted with Mr. Burke; and, from his entrance into Parliament, had cultivated a clo&s;e intimacy with him, even while, for years, he was one of his mo&s;t for|midable antagoni&s;ts in publick debate. Their friend&s;hip was, of cour&s;e, encrea&s;ed by acting together in oppo&s;ition; though in that &s;ituation for years, Mr. Fox kept him&s;elf open for any other political engagement, and was not con|&s;idered as actually a member of the &s;ame party with his friend. Mr. Burke never urged him to become &s;o. He fairly repre&s;ented to him, as he con&s;tantly did to others, that he had little hope of &s;ucce&s;s. He never gave any man advice to act contrary to his intere&s;ts, but &s;tating tho&s;e for the con&s;ideration of the per&s;on him&s;elf, he

laid before him all the facts and the principles on which he might form his own deci&s;ion. In this manner he certainly did prepare the mind of Mr. Fox to join the party, and the minds of the party to receive Mr. Fox, and place him at their head; an event, in which, when it happened, no man more &s;incerely rejoiced.</P>
<P>The principles on which Mr. Burke &s;upported the party wherein he &s;pent his life, are not left to be collected from detached &s;entences in his various productions, or ca&s;ual phra&s;es dropped in debate, and ill pre&s;erved by memories, on which, if even the intentions of the reporters were always upright, little reliance could be placed in a que&s;tion of any delicacy. They were early recorded by him&s;elf at large, and in a body. He found the Whig party under Lord Rockingham, when they were compelled to &s;et up a methodized oppo&s;ition, to be, indeed, men of &s;entiments eminently good and ju&s;t: yet what they felt rightly, they had not deduced &s;y&s;tema|tically.
<PB N="xxix" REF="28">
They were new to their &s;ituation. It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, in erecting their &s;tand|ard, to publi&s;h their declaration to their coun|try. The ta&s;k of preparing it, was undertaken by Mr. Burke; and, in 1770, executed by him, in a pamphlet called, "Thoughts on the Cau&s;es of the pre&s;ent Di&s;contents." The materials of it were collected from various con|ver&s;ations with all the leading members of the party; and before it was &s;ent abroad into the world, the particular and di&s;tinct approbation of each was obtained. From this he &s;hould be judged, if he is to be fairly tried for incon|&s;i&s;tency. But, among all his works, the pam|phlet of 1770 has been lea&s;t quoted, if at all. It certainly does not contain any tenets of de|mocracy. The clear object of the whole is to recommend, as the be&s;t practical government for this country, an open ari&s;tocracy of rank, property, virtue and talents, acting in concert together, on a known and avowed &s;y&s;tem of opinions, agreeable to the exi&s;ting con&s;titution of
<PB N="xxx" REF="29">
the kingdom, acquiring by their principles and conduct the publick confidence of the people, and, in all tho&s;e titles claiming the publick con|fidence of the Sovereign.</P>
<P>None of his writings on the French Revolu|tion were ever pur&s;ued with a more violent cry than was that pamphlet, by the Republicans of the day. But they were then of little compa|rative &s;trength in numbers or influence. By one writer, his book was called, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an impo&s;i|tion on the publick," and "a &s;cheme, cal|culated to perpetuate our di&s;tre&s;&s;es;" he was "the organ of a di&s;contented faction," and "the ma&s;k of patrioti&s;m dropped while he was writing." </Q>Another <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"wondered at the cor|ruptne&s;s of his heart, and the deception of his head;" and, in language &s;imilar to that of the writer ju&s;t quoted, de&s;cribed the pam|phlet as de&s;igned "to guard again&s;t the po&s;&s;ible con&s;equence of an effectual reformation in the vitiated parts of our con&s;titution and govern|ment."</Q>
<PB N="xxxi" REF="30">
What &s;ort of reform it was, to which Mr. Burke, on that occa&s;ion, was &s;up|po&s;ed to be an enemy, may be collected from the great principle which is laid down by this adver&s;ary, in the &s;pirit, and almo&s;t in the very words, of the Revolutioni&s;ts in France. It is &s;aid, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the modes of government which have ever been impo&s;ed on credulous man, have been not only deficient in producing the ju&s;t ends of government, viz. the full and impartial &s;ecurity of the rights of nature; but al&s;o have been rather formidable and dangerous cabals again&s;t the peace, happine&s;s and dignity of &s;ociety. In tracing the origin of all governments," (it is added a little lower down) "we find them either the produce of lawle&s;s power, or accident, acted on by cor|rupt intere&s;t. The &s;ame circum&s;tance that attends the formation of governments, attends what is called their reformation: and of this the hi&s;tory of our own country affords a melancholy example."</Q> Mr. Paine's two parts
<PB N="xxxii" REF="31">
of the Rights of Man are but a paraphra&s;e of the&s;e texts.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke and his friends at that time, never denied that it was their purpo&s;e to re&s;i&s;t with all their might the <Q REND="inline">"effectual reformations"</Q> there &s;ugge&s;ted, and to &s;upport the <Q REND="inline">"melancholy ex|ample"</Q> afforded by the <HI>&s;ettlement</HI> of our own revolution in the la&s;t century. They always gloried in the accu&s;ation. To convict &s;uch of them as yet remain, before any impartial tribunal, on a charge of incon&s;i&s;tency, in not depreciating that example, and not admiring tho&s;e effectual reformations now, will require more than decla|mation for argument, and mutilated fragments for evidence again&s;t them. Indeed an author who is by no means deficient in &s;everity again&s;t Mr. Burke, but who appears to be well read in his works, drawing a parallel between his con|duct and that of Mr. Fox, has very ju&s;tly and candidly acquitted Mr. Burke from this charge. He repre&s;ents the "Thoughts on the cau&s;es of
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="32">
the pre&s;ent di&s;contents" as a Creed of Ari&s;tocracy; and the fault which he finds with the framer of that creed is not that he had &s;werved from it, but that he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"had neglected the progre&s;s of the hu|man mind, &s;ub&s;equent to its adoption."</Q></P>
<P>The principles, however, which led Mr. Burke to condemn the French Revolution, are to be traced to a much more di&s;tant date, and long before he became a publick man. They are to be di&s;cerned in his fir&s;t acknowledged pro|duction, the "Vindication of natural &s;ociety." This was an ironical expo&s;ure of Lord Bolin|broke's fal&s;e philo&s;ophy. His cau&s;e of quarrel was the mi&s;chievous tendency of the principles in&s;inuated by that lively but di&s;ingenuous writer, who, in his opinion <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;apped the foundation of every virtue, and all government, while he attacked every mode of religion."</Q> The fol|lowers of that &s;chool were then chiefly if not wholly confined to the higher cla&s;&s;es, and he wi&s;hed to warn them in time of the dangers
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="33">
which they incurred, and which, in other Coun|tries have &s;ince actually fallen upon them, from the u&s;e that might be made of their own arms in the hands of others. His de&s;ign, as he him|&s;elf explained it, was <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to &s;hew that without the exertion of any con&s;iderable forces, the &s;ame engines which were employed for the de&s;truc|tion of religion, might be employed with equal &s;ucce&s;s for the &s;ubver&s;ion of Govern|ment; and that &s;pecious arguments might be u&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e things, which they who doubted of every thing el&s;e, would (at that period) never permit to be que&s;tioned."</Q> Accordingly the vindication of natural &s;ociety con&s;i&s;ts wholly in touching with vivacity on a number of common-place topicks from the abu&s;es incident to, or rather from the evils &s;uffered under, all the &s;everal forms of political &s;ociety, with an intimation that our own mixed con&s;titution could no more &s;tand this te&s;t, than the &s;imple forms. Copying the accu&s;tomed fallacy of the noble author, whom he per&s;onated, he de|clined
<PB N="xxxv" REF="34">
giving any &s;y&s;tem of his own, well aware as he was even then, how much more ea&s;y it was in the &s;cheme of that philo&s;ophy, to demoli&s;h, than to rebuild. He urged the&s;e &s;ophi&s;tries then as too futile to be taken for any thing but ridicule; yet they have &s;ince been gravely pro|duced as wonderful di&s;coveries. He thought them &s;ufficient to &s;tartle the di&s;ciples of Lord Bolingbroke in that day; but, the French, who profe&s;s to have taken that noble philo&s;opher as one of their ma&s;ters, have gone the whole length in a de&s;perate experiment on a great kingdom; and Mr. Burke, in his la&s;t labours, was only waging with more &s;erious vigour the &s;ame war, in which, with lighter weapons, he made the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay of his juvenile &s;trength. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s over without notice in the preface, which di&s;clo&s;es the real intention of that tract, a beauti|ful &s;train of the &s;ame pious humility which cha|racterized his wi&s;dom to the la&s;t moment of his life. He expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;atisfied that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a mind which has no re&s;traint from a &s;en&s;e of its own
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="35">
weakne&s;s, of its &s;ubordinate rank in the cre|ation, and of the extreme danger of letting the imagination loo&s;e upon &s;ome &s;ubjects, may very plau&s;ibly attack every thing the mo&s;t ex|cellent and venerable."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Even in matters (adds he) which are, as it were, ju&s;t within our reach, what would become of the world, if the practice of all moral duties, and the foun|dations of &s;ociety re&s;ted upon having their rea&s;ons made clear and demon&s;trative to every individual?"</Q></P>
<P>This fixed per&s;ua&s;ion of his youth, as to the pernicious effects of the new philo&s;ophy, was many years after confirmed, when he was at Paris not long before the acce&s;&s;ion of Louis the XVIth. He was courted and care&s;&s;ed, as a man of emi|nence, by the literary cabal which was then pre|paring the way for the overthrow of Altars and Thrones. They daily be&s;et him, and commu|nicated to him enough to let a mind &s;o ob&s;ervant, as his, into all their &s;ecrets. From that time he
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="36">
always dated tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, which made him fore&s;ee, in their fir&s;t rudiments, the hideous con|&s;equences of the doctrines propagated, and the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued, by the pretended National A&s;&s;embly of France. Not long after his return from Paris he took occa&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of Commons to te&s;tify tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions. In a &s;peech, of which no &s;atisfactory report was ever given, but which was taken in &s;hort-hand, and of which a copy remains corrected by him&s;elf, he pointed out the con&s;piracy of Athei&s;m to the watchful jealou&s;y of Governments. He pro|fe&s;&s;ed that he was not over-fond of calling in the aid of the &s;ecular arm to &s;uppre&s;s doctrines and opinions; but if ever it was to be rai&s;ed, it &s;hould be again&s;t tho&s;e enemies of their kind, who would take from us the noble&s;t prerogative of our nature, that of being a religious animal. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Already</HI> (continued he) <HI>under the &s;y&s;tematick attacks of tho&s;e men, I &s;ee many of the props of good government beginning to fail; I &s;ee propa|gated principles which will not leave to religion</HI>
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="37">
<HI>even a toleration, and make virtue her &s;elf le&s;s than a name.</HI>"</Q> He recommended that a grand alliance &s;hould be formed among all believers <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>again&s;t tho&s;e mini&s;ters of rebellious darkne&s;s, who were endeavouring to &s;hake all the works of God, e&s;tabli&s;hed in beauty and order.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>With a mind thus long before prepared, he could not be &s;low in forming his notions of the French Revolution. Neverthele&s;s he &s;ought information from every quarter, as if the &s;ubject had been wholly new to him. He de&s;ired all per&s;ons of his acquaintance who were going to Paris, (and curio&s;ity attracted many) to bring him whatever they could collect of the greate&s;t circulation, both on the one &s;ide and the other. He had al&s;o many corre&s;pondents, not only among the Engli&s;h and Americans re&s;iding there, but al&s;o among the natives, to whom, as well as to other foreigners, he had always done the honours of this country, as far as his means would permit him, with liberal ho&s;pitality.
<PB N="xxxix" REF="38">
Among others, he received letters endea|vouring to trick out the events of the Revolution in the mo&s;t gaudy colouring, from Mr. Paine, Mr. Chri&s;tie, and Baron Cloots, afterwards better, known by the name of Anachar&s;is. It was in an&s;wer to a letter of this kind, from a French Gentleman, that he wrote his celebrated "Re|flexions."</P>
<P>While he was employed upon that work, in the beginning of the year 1790, the prai&s;e be|&s;towed by Mr. Fox on the behaviour of the French Guards, in taking part with the populace, fir&s;t induced him to deliver his &s;entiments on that &s;ubject in the Hou&s;e of Commons. The circum&s;tances of that debate, and the noble deportment of Mr. Fox, who profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to have learned more from Mr. Burke than from all men and all books put together, and who, aften having heard his friend's &s;peech, declared that there was, there could be, no difference in their princi|ples, however they might differ in their application
<PB N="xl" REF="39">
of the &s;ame principles, cannot but be too well remembered to need repetition. In con&s;equence of what then pa&s;&s;ed, the "Reflexions" were con&s;iderably enlarged from the fir&s;t &s;ketch of them, and &s;till further additions were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively made, as the plot of the con&s;pirators in France daily more and more unfolded it&s;elf in all it's parts. The book was publi&s;hed in the following Autumn; and Mr. Burke had the &s;atisfaction of receiving explicit te&s;timonies of concurrence and applau&s;e from the principal members of the party, with whom he had begun his political career.</P>
<P>Having given this &s;olemn warning to his country, and to Europe, he in no way brought the &s;ubject again before the publick, till Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan the next year, in three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive debates, introduced the prai&s;es of the French Revolution. On the la&s;t of the&s;e occa|&s;ions, Mr. Burke immediately ro&s;e to an&s;wer Mr. Fox, but was prevented (it was then three
<PB N="xli" REF="40">
in the morning) by a loud cry for the que&s;tion. He afterwards took the fir&s;t opportunity, which he thought regular, and mo&s;t favourable to his &s;ituation, un&s;upported as he was, to at|tempt a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the principle. He was, however, repeatedly interrupted. The debate, at length, was forced into a per&s;onal contention between him and Mr. Fox. The &s;cene, alto|gether, was of the mo&s;t afflicting kind.</P>
<P>Having found him&s;elf on that night alone, oppo&s;ed to a ho&s;t of enemies, he con&s;idered him&s;elf as ab&s;olved from every obligation of party. He made his appeal, as he called it, from the New to the Old Whigs; from the de|clamations of his contemporaries in debate, to the recorded doctrines of the great actors in our Revolution, affirmed by both Hou&s;es of Parliament, on an important trial projected and pro&s;ecuted to that very end. He knew, in|deed, that many of tho&s;e whom he had left, en|tertained in their hearts the &s;ame &s;entiments with
<PB N="xlii" REF="41">
him&s;elf, but till they &s;hould have publickly and explicitly avowed them&s;elves, &s;o that he could con&s;i&s;tently and honourably act with them, he regarded him&s;elf as a mere individual member of Parliament, con&s;cientiou&s;ly pur&s;uing what the di&s;cipline of his early &s;tudies, the ob&s;ervation of his more mature years, and his recent exa|mination of the event &s;o long anticipated by him, had firmly per&s;uaded him to be right. He did not &s;eek to engage him&s;elf with any other party. It was not till &s;ome months after, that he fir&s;t &s;aw Mr. Pitt in private &s;ociety, &s;ince the latter had been placed at the head of admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e of the year 1791, a private friend of Mr. Burke's, connected with Mini&s;try, fir&s;t made him acquainted with the re&s;idence of Mr. Adair at the Court of St. Peter&s;burgh, and with the circum&s;tance of a letter having been intercepted from that Gentleman to Mr. Fox, which was repre&s;ented to be of a very criminal complexion. The whole proceeding was in it's
<PB N="xliii" REF="42">
very e&s;&s;ence contrary to Mr. Burke's notions of propriety and duty. He manife&s;ted this in his own conduct. When his &s;on went to Coblentz in that very Summer, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to obtain the approbation of Government. When, too, about the &s;ame time, the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia had written him a very gracious letter on &s;ome of his publications, and he had prepared an an&s;wer, intended to confirm that Sovereign in the warm intere&s;t which &s;he then appeared to take, in what he thought the common cau&s;e of Europe, he conceived him&s;elf bound to communicate it to Mini&s;ters. He did &s;o; and in con&s;equence of &s;ome doubts which they entertained (ju&s;t doubts, as &s;ub&s;equent events have &s;hewn) he con&s;ented to &s;uppre&s;s it. With the&s;e &s;entiments, he was &s;incerely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at the intelligence which he received re&s;pecting Mr. Adair; the more &s;o, as it was intimated to him, that &s;ome &s;erious mea|&s;ures were in contemplation on that &s;ubject. Mr. Fox him&s;elf afterwards told him that he did expect &s;ome motion of that de&s;cription to be
<PB N="xliv" REF="43">
brought before the Hou&s;e. Mr. Burke, in con|&s;equence, purpo&s;ely ab&s;ented him&s;elf from the debate, unable to defend, and unwilling to join in accu&s;ing, a man for whom he &s;till cheri&s;hed the memory of pa&s;t friend&s;hip. The &s;ubject in truth was never agitated. He had therefore no opportunity of checking the account which he had received. But when the &s;purious edition of his private Memorial to the Duke of Portland came forth, he watched the publick prints with &s;ome attention, looking for an explanation which was promi&s;ed. Had any been given, which might have &s;atisfied his mind, it is believed, that he meant to have corrected any errour of fact. On the principle of his cen&s;ure he was not to be &s;haken.</P>
<P>The formation of the Society, calling it&s;elf the Friends of the People, on the one &s;ide, and the King's Proclamation again&s;t &s;editious writings on the other, brought Mr. Burke, in 1792, once more into contact with &s;ome of his old
<PB N="xlv" REF="44">
friends, by whom the former mea&s;ure was con|demned, and the latter &s;upported. After the retreat of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia out of France, thinking that the &s;tate of this country, and of Europe, demanded the united efforts of all pub|lick men, he made an attempt again to collect around him &s;uch of them as &s;aw in the &s;ame light with him&s;elf, the danger which menaced the whole &s;ocial and moral order of the world. In one of the&s;e con&s;ultations he expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t regard for Mr. Fox, his regret for the difference between them, and his eager de&s;ire that all con&s;ideration of him&s;elf &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, if Mr. Fox could be won to the true in|tere&s;ts and &s;ervice of his Country. He &s;aid, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if an objection per&s;onal to him&s;elf could po&s;|&s;ibly lurk in the heart of any one, which might make him &s;tand in the way of &s;uch a broad and exten&s;ive &s;ettlement, as that alarm|ing Cri&s;is demanded, be&s;ides freely abandon|ing any preten&s;ions of his own, he was ready to go out of the kingdom, and to render
<PB N="xlvi" REF="45">
him&s;elf a voluntary exile."</Q> The earne&s;t manner in which he uttered this effu&s;ion, was felt and is &s;till remembered by tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent; and they who be&s;t knew him, are &s;atisfied, that he would have executed, if nece&s;|&s;ary, what he then propo&s;ed. At the &s;ame period too, and indeed at all times in all his occa&s;ional intercour&s;e with Mini&s;ters, he laboured nothing more than to di&s;po&s;e them, in whatever arrange|ment they might project for &s;trengthening Government, above all things to include Mr. Fox. With him, it was Mr. Burke's opinion, that the &s;afety of Europe might have been rea|&s;onably hoped; without him, that it ought to be attempted. But Mr. Fox per&s;i&s;ted in the cour&s;e on which he had already entered; and the great body of tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ented from him, could not at once bring them&s;elves to break through their long habits of confidence in him, &s;o as to act &s;teadily again&s;t his coun&s;els.</P>
<P>At the opening of the next Se&s;&s;ion of Parlia|ment, the Mini&s;ter had vacated his &s;eat. From
<PB N="xlvii" REF="46">
his ab&s;ence the &s;pirit and vigour of oppo&s;ition &s;eemed to ri&s;e; and on the &s;ide of Government there was more room and more nece&s;&s;ity for in|dividuals to &s;tand forward in the conte&s;t. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, Mr. Burke was the principal per&s;on, to who&s;e &s;entiments the nation looked on the que&s;tions of that day. In the fir&s;t debate he employed towards Mr. Fox a tone of friendly remon&s;trance, unmixed with any thing of a&s;pe|rity. Afterwards, in one of the pa&s;&s;ages of the Hou&s;e of Commons, he accidentally met Mr. Fox, who, taking him by the hand, told him <Q REND="inline">"that he would do more in that way, than in any other."</Q> But on the two following days the purport of Mr. Fox's repeated motions, and the vehemence of his manner (which is impetuous even where there is nothing violent in the matter) made it impracticable, as Mr. Burke &s;aid, to pre|&s;erve a &s;imilar &s;tyle of conciliation. He was con&s;cious that he kindled, as on the other &s;ide the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions grew more and more enflamed, or produced a more inten&s;e &s;en&s;ation from the
<PB N="xlviii" REF="47">
continued action of the &s;ame heat. His feelings on the occa&s;ion will be &s;een in his "Ob&s;erva|tions" on the proceedings of that Se&s;&s;ion. From that moment he &s;aw, and he &s;aw with pain, that the die was ca&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke was by no means &s;ingular in re|ceiving the impre&s;&s;ion, which he did, from the conduct of Mr. Fox. The current of popular opinion &s;et &s;trongly again&s;t the latter. He &s;oon became &s;en&s;ible, that his con&s;tituents in general di&s;approved what he had done, and that even among tho&s;e, who&s;e partiality to him was mo&s;t con&s;picuous, there were many, who, when he was attacked on that &s;core, profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves neither able nor willing to defend him. In con|&s;equence he felt him&s;elf obliged not only to &s;ign a loyal a&s;&s;ociation of his own pari&s;h, contrary to his own avowed opinion, as Mr. Burke has re|marked, but al&s;o to explain his principles and mea&s;ures in a printed letter to his con&s;tituents.</P>
<P><PB N="xlix" REF="48">
This publication was &s;oon taken up by the mo&s;t zealous &s;upporters of Mr. Fox, in the Whig Club; a &s;ociety which had been founded chiefly with a view to embody, &s;trengthen, and extend his per&s;onal intere&s;t in We&s;tmin&s;ter, though not wholly without regard al&s;o to the general principles and the political &s;ucce&s;s of the party to which he belonged. At the monthly meeting of February, a vote of thanks to him for his late conduct was moved, but withdrawn at his own de&s;ire. He did not conceal that as many of his friends, whom he mo&s;t re&s;pected, were known to differ in &s;entiments from him, &s;uch a vote mu&s;t inevitably tend to di&s;union, and that it was in it&s;elf unnece&s;&s;ary, as even his enemies did not charge him with bad motives. His di&s;cretion, however, on this occa&s;ion, as in &s;ome other memorable in&s;tances, was unable to controul the zeal of tho&s;e, who call them&s;elves his Friends, and who avowing his elevation to Power to be the fir&s;t aim of all their politicks, &s;eem always to treat him as incapable of chu&s;ing
<PB N="l" REF="49">
for him&s;elf, or as &s;peaking a language of ma|nagement foreign to the heart. They doubt either his judgment or his &s;incerity. They think, that they can do him no greater &s;ervice than by plunging, where they tru&s;t that in any event he will follow, becau&s;e he cannot de&s;ert tho&s;e, who profe&s;s to &s;acrifice every thing for him. In this &s;pirit, notwith&s;tanding his di&s;|&s;ua&s;ion of the &s;tep, as both unnece&s;&s;ary and mi&s;chievous, on the very &s;ame day a requi&s;ition was made, and the next day adverti&s;ed in the publick papers, for the holding of an extra|ordinary meeting; the purpo&s;e of which was to con&s;ider of voting the approbation and thanks of the Club to Mr. Fox, for the principles and arguments of his letter to his con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>The prudent part even of tho&s;e who agreed with Mr. Fox, looked forward to the motion with alarm. It was not their inclination, it was not their policy, to precipitate a breach. They would be left in the hands of tho&s;e, whom they
<PB N="li" REF="50">
had already found them&s;elves unable to govern; and the &s;eparation of others, in who&s;e pub|lick virtue and integrity &s;ober-minded men mo&s;t confided, would give their enemies a deci&s;ive advantage over them, e&s;pecially in what they knew to be a moment of unpopularity. The authority of tho&s;e, who &s;hould &s;ecede, would of cour&s;e be wre&s;ted into evidence again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould remain, and would be u&s;ed to lend a colour to the wor&s;t con&s;tructions of their motives. They could not &s;top what they dreaded; they tried, therefore, to negociate a compromi&s;e. They brought &s;ome of the more violent to &s;omething of apparent moderation. On the other &s;ide, they urged all the con&s;iderations which they profe&s;&s;ed to have determined them|&s;elves; and they put it to the friend&s;hip, to the ju&s;tice, to the candour of tho&s;e whom they ad|dre&s;&s;ed, whether they could, directly or indi|rectly, &s;anction what were called the calumnies malevolently &s;pread again&s;t a man, to whom all declared a warm affection. The two noble
<PB N="lii" REF="51">
chiefs of the party, who were convinced, with Mr. Burke, how much depended on gaining Mr. Fox to the common cau&s;e of all e&s;tabli&s;hed order, but who had not yet, with Mr. Burke, de&s;paired of gaining him, con&s;ented at la&s;t to acquie&s;ce &s;ilently in &s;ome general contradiction of the a&s;&s;erted calumnies. Accordingly, when the day of the meeting came, as the under&s;tood price of their continuance in the &s;ociety, (they were not then pre&s;ent) a new motion was &s;ub|&s;tituted for that which had been adverti&s;ed. But it was exactly what every attempt at com|prehending oppo&s;ite &s;entiments mu&s;t ever be, vague, loo&s;e, ambiguous, admitting any future interpretation. It did not at all a&s;certain, as it &s;hould have done, what were the mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions, and by whom employed, which were &s;o very injurious to Mr. Fox, as to make this de|claration nece&s;&s;ary now, which he him&s;elf &s;o &s;hort a time before had pronounced and &s;hewn to be unnece&s;&s;ary. In propo&s;ing the amended re&s;olve, the chairman, Lord Wil|liam
<PB N="liii" REF="52">
Ru&s;&s;ell, &s;poke of it as virtually the &s;ame with that which it had &s;uper&s;eded, and only in|tended to &s;upply what was there thought defi|cient, by adding a di&s;approbation of the calum|nies propagated again&s;t Mr. Fox to the appro|bation of his principles and arguments. Of cour&s;e it pa&s;&s;ed unanimou&s;ly. Mr. Burke has abbreviated it, but at full length it ran; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Whig Club think it their duty, at this extraordinary juncture, to a&s;&s;ure the Right Hon. Charles James Fox, that all the arts of mi&s;repre&s;entation, which have been &s;o indu&s;|triou&s;ly u&s;ed of late, for the purpo&s;e of calumniating him, have had no other effect upon them, than that of confirming, &s;trength|ening, and encrea&s;ing their attachment to him."</Q></P>
<P>When this re&s;olution was made publick, many gentlemen quitted the club, for which they &s;tated their rea&s;ons in a letter &s;igned by all of them but one. They expre&s;&s;ed great per&s;onal re&s;pect
<PB N="liv" REF="53">
for Mr. Fox, but, combining all the circum|&s;tances, they could not con&s;true the vote otherwi&s;e than as approving, without qualification, what had been done by Mr. Fox in that &s;e&s;&s;ion: they did not agree in that approval, and they could not come to the conclu&s;ion, that their attachment to him was encrea&s;ed. Mr. Burke was in the number of the &s;eceders, but had no concern in drawing up the letter. The fir&s;t movers of the whole bu&s;ine&s;s congratulated them&s;elves upon the event, as upon a victory. It was trumpeted about by the runners of the party as a deci&s;ion (though in reality it was nothing le&s;s than a de|ci&s;ion) of Mr. Burke's two noble friends again&s;t his opinions; and his &s;peeches in Parliament were plainly enough intimated to have been the mi&s;repre&s;entations, by which Mr. Fox was &s;up|po&s;ed to have been calumniated.</P>
<P>The &s;ece&s;&s;ion gave ri&s;e for a &s;hort time to the appearance of a third party, with which Mr. Burke might have acted in full conformity with
<PB N="lv" REF="54">
all his principles; he might have placed him|&s;elf at the head of it; and, had he been an in|tere&s;ted or an ambitious man, he might ea&s;ily have &s;tepped from that eminence into a &s;tation, which good men wi&s;hed to &s;ee him fill, and which his enemies, for the purpo&s;e of maligning his motives, more than once fal&s;ely reported that he actually had accepted. But he &s;till kept aloof from every new connexion. He contented him&s;elf with drawing up at the inter|vals, which his occupation in the impeachment of Mr. Ha&s;tings afforded him, tho&s;e Ob&s;erva|tions, which he afterwards &s;ent to the Duke of Portland, on the conduct of the Minority in that Se&s;&s;ion. This he thought nece&s;&s;ary from the proceedings of the Whig Club, and &s;till more from the &s;ub&s;equent con&s;truction put upon them. His motives and his objects in writing this paper are affectingly &s;tated in the letter, which accompanied it to his Noble Friend.</P>
<P><PB N="lvi" REF="55">
Having thus lodged his "Te&s;tamentary Prote&s;t," he waited with impatience for his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from publick life. For &s;ome time pa&s;t, nothing had detained him in Parliament, but the &s;acred duty, which he felt, of &s;truggling to the la&s;t for the coercion and puni&s;hment of what he mo&s;t unfeignedly and &s;tedfa&s;tly believed to be the flagrant enormities of the Ea&s;t, the cold-blooded tyranny of avarice, which oppre&s;&s;ed millions of the innocent natives, and the baneful corruptions, which &s;preading thence, threatened to infect and poi&s;on the whole body of this realm. Having no per&s;onal inducement whatever (bold as have been the fal&s;ehoods to the contrary) he had never &s;ought that Herculean labour. When the Select Committee, of which he was &s;o effi|cient a Member, and in which all that followed had its origin, was fir&s;t appointed in the admi|ni&s;tration of Lord North, it is well known to many, that he very reluctantly, and not without much importunity of his friends, accepted the honour of being put on the li&s;t for the ballot.
<PB N="lvii" REF="56">
He too well fore&s;aw how ob&s;tinate and perilous a combat he was to wage. In refu&s;ing, &s;o long before, the commi&s;&s;ion to reform abu&s;es in Ben|gal, one of his rea&s;ons had been a &s;u&s;picion, that the Company did not &s;incerely de&s;ire any radical reform. He had &s;een a faction of their &s;ervants, for years, baffle a Majority of the Directors &s;up|ported by the Mini&s;ter Lord North; and he was not ignorant, how much every year had encrea&s;ed the &s;trength of that faction. But from the mo|ment that he undertook the enquiry, he deter|mined that nothing &s;hould divert him from car|rying it, as far as it depended upon him, to its proper and legitimate conclu&s;ion. While a publick clamour was rai&s;ed about the delay of the impeachment, and he was reproached as the cau&s;e of it, he was in reality di&s;charging an irk|&s;ome tru&s;t, that alone retarded the execution of all the plans, to which he had long looked for the repo&s;e and comfort of his declining age. At length, having fini&s;hed his ta&s;k towards the clo&s;e of the Se&s;&s;ion in 1794, he received the thanks
<PB N="lviii" REF="57">
of the Hou&s;e for his management of their Pro|&s;ecution.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time his exertions in the only other publick bu&s;ine&s;s, to which he had for a long time pa&s;t attended, obtained the &s;anction of both Hou&s;es of Parliament. The plot for the overthrow of our Con&s;titution, on which he had given the fir&s;t alarm, had now gained &s;o much head, as to force it&s;elf on the attention of the Legi&s;lature. A Secret Committee of the Lords, and another of the Commons &s;everally made re|ports, on which the mo&s;t &s;erious proceedings were afterwards grounded. Men of ingenious minds and practi&s;ed &s;kill in the arts of popular eloquence, may di&s;pute (and what may they not di&s;pute?) the preci&s;e extent of legal criminality, which may have attached to the actual conduct of the per&s;ons then put on their trials for high trea&s;on; but no man of common apprehen&s;ion and common hone&s;ty can read the evidence there adduced, and &s;ay, that no plot at all of the na|ture
<PB N="lix" REF="58">
&s;o often charged by Mr. Burke exi&s;ted, and grew, and was &s;preading it&s;elf rapidly over the country.</P>
<P>The Debates on the&s;e Reports of the Secret Committee effected, at length, what the example and arguments of Mr. Burke had failed to ac|compli&s;h. The principles of the Oppo&s;ition Party were brought to the te&s;t on a fundamental que&s;tion of dome&s;tick policy; and from that time the &s;eparation between them and the Noble friends of Mr. Burke was complete. The latter &s;oon after formed a junction with Admini&s;tra|tion; a mea&s;ure, of which Mr. Burke has been erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed the author, but of which, in fact, he knew nothing, till it was actually &s;et|tled; not, indeed, in all the particular details, but in the general outline.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the Negotiation Mr. Burke vacated his Seat. It was generally expected by the Nation, and even called for in a very hand|&s;ome
<PB N="lx" REF="59">
manner by &s;ome members of the Mino|rity, that &s;uch a publick provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for him, as would afford ea&s;e and dignity to his retirement. Nor were Mini&s;ters wanting in the conte&s;t of genero&s;ity. They voluntarily ac|quainted &s;ome of his friends with their intentions of advi&s;ing the King to be&s;tow upon him an affluent income, and the honour of the Peerage, not as a mark of favour in a new arrangement of power, but as a debt &s;trictly due to him from his country.</P>
<P>Every thing, beyond what he had ever &s;uffered him&s;elf to indulge to his de&s;ires, &s;eemed now to be within his reach, and he had only to enjoy the retreat, which he had laid out in pro|&s;pect on the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of moral duty, that governed all the deliberate acts of his life; when his &s;on, in whom every thing centered, and whom he had ju&s;t &s;een elected into that a&s;&s;embly which he had him&s;elf &s;o long delighted, in|&s;tructed and adorned, was unexpectedly &s;natched
<PB N="lxi" REF="60">
from him for ever. From that day he thought only of preparing for his own departure with decency and in quiet, by &s;atisfying all ju&s;t de|mands upon him. He received, therefore, with gratitude, the munificence of his Sovereign, in the pen&s;ion which was &s;ettled on him&s;elf and Mrs. Burke &s;oon after their common misfor|tune, accompanied with a gracious intimation, that &s;till more was intended. But, from the death of his &s;on, (except, on his part, to with|draw his claims) no mention was made of the fir&s;t and highe&s;t reward, which, for the &s;ake of that &s;on alone, had ever been a tran&s;ient object of his ambition. To the memory of the child whom he &s;o tenderly loved, and who by his filial piety repaid, as by his other virtues and talents he ju&s;tified that love, he has rendered an elegant tribute of affectionate prai&s;e in the Letter which he publi&s;hed on the Duke of Bed|ford's &s;peech; and in that, now fir&s;t publi&s;hed on the &s;peech of another noble Duke, will be
<PB N="lxii" REF="61">
found two pa&s;&s;ages, perhaps &s;till more intere&s;t|ing, becau&s;e more &s;imple, when his &s;orrow was more fre&s;h.</P>
<P>His grief was undoubtedly &s;trong and deep; but it was never of that exce&s;&s;ive kind which was weakly, perhaps wickedly, reported. It never relaxed the vigour of his mind, whatever &s;ubject called upon him to exert it, nor the intere&s;t which he took, to the la&s;t moment, in the public weal. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A country," (he &s;aid, not many months before his death) "which has been dear to us from our birth, ought to be dear to us from our entrance into the &s;tage, to our final exit from the &s;tage, upon which we have been appointed to act."</Q> He found, however, as was natural, a &s;uperiour plea&s;ure in tho&s;e &s;ub|jects which were mingled up with the remem|brance of his &s;on. His attention, therefore, was particularly excited by the nomination of Earl Fitzwilliam to the government of Ireland;
<PB N="lxiii" REF="62">
a Nobleman with whom he had not only a long and cordial friend&s;hip, but under who&s;e imme|diate au&s;pices his &s;on was to have commenced his publick career; and who was going to a &s;cene of action, in which that &s;on had lately di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as agent for the Roman Catholicks of that kingdom. His own &s;enti|ments on the political expediency of granting relief to that great body, which, with the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions to Monarchy, and to the reigning Monarch, (from whom they know the fir&s;t miti|gation of their condition to have directly come,) contains more than three-fourths of the whole population of Ireland, are well known from &s;everal publications of his on that que&s;tion. He would have rai&s;ed them finally, but, by due degrees, to the level of other Di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, too many of whom are much le&s;s friendly to the Con&s;titution of their Country.</P>
<P><PB N="lxiv" REF="63">
The leading principle of Lord Fitzwilliam's admini&s;tration was to convert that, which is now our weakne&s;s, into our mo&s;t efficient &s;trength. He wi&s;hed to unite, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the affec|tions of all cla&s;&s;es. The pride of the higher orders he would have flattered by cheri&s;hing among them, what had mo&s;t re&s;emblance of a country-party, in &s;ubordination to the enlarged intere&s;ts of the Briti&s;h Empire, he would have &s;ubdued faction and con&s;piracy by conciliating the great ma&s;s of the people; and far from em|ploying &s;o large a part of our own natural force in defeating the attempts of dome&s;tick rebellion and foreign inva&s;ion in that quarter, he would have made that i&s;land a place of arms, from whence, if the vigour of our coun&s;els had ri&s;en to meet the exigencies of our &s;ituation, we might have poured forth unexhau&s;ted armies of a brave and loyal nation to the &s;uccour of our be&s;t and mo&s;t meritorious allies in France. The experi|ment was not fully tried; but, as far as it went, every appearance indicated &s;ucce&s;s. Tho&s;e
<PB N="lxv" REF="64">
publick men, who certainly then enjoyed the greate&s;t &s;hare of popular favour, &s;tood forth in the &s;upport of government and the war. Never was the parliament of that country &s;o unanimous. Never were &s;uch large &s;upplies voted, and with|out a murmur. Never did a Governor receive &s;uch incontrovertible proofs of publick love and veneration in the addre&s;&s;es of all ranks, all civil de&s;criptions, all religious per&s;ua&s;ions, even after that which in other ca&s;es would have been called di&s;grace. Into the immediate merits of his recall, as the que&s;tion was put, Mr. Burke would never enter. He conceived it of mo&s;t importance, as a &s;ymptom and progno&s;tick. He was in&s;tantly &s;atisfied, though it happened many months before our fir&s;t indirect &s;olicitation for peace, that we were then preparing to abandon what he always maintained as the great object of the war. For, he argued, if Mini&s;ters had been earne&s;t in pro|&s;ecuting the momentous cau&s;e, in which we were engaged, and had entertained a &s;erious &s;en&s;e or the encrea&s;ing danger, that menaced every thing
<PB N="lxvi" REF="65">
valuable to us, they would not have a&s;ked, whe|ther the Lord Lieutenant had anticipated re|que&s;ts, by which he &s;hould have waited to be importuned; or whether he had removed from their &s;tations at one &s;troke two con&s;iderable officers of the Crown in whom he had no confi|dence, in&s;tead of di&s;placing them &s;eparately, and at intervals: they would only have enquired, whether the King's bu&s;ine&s;s had been done with zeal and effect. Had there been a cordial con|&s;ent of principle on both &s;ides the water, he was per&s;uaded, that &s;ome way or other would ea&s;ily have been found to compromi&s;e all inferiour con|&s;iderations. He did not di&s;&s;emble the&s;e opinions: on the contrary, he &s;pared no exertion, though in vain, to impre&s;s them on all the leading Members of Government in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>An enquiry into the cau&s;es of the Lord Lieu|tenant's &s;udden recall was moved in both Hou&s;es of Parliament here. In the Hou&s;e of Lords, a Peer of the highe&s;t rank, in urging the motion,
<PB N="lxvii" REF="66">
took occa&s;ion to throw out &s;ome in&s;inuations again&s;t Mr. Burke, as having de&s;erted his ancient friends and principles, and as having written a book, which, amid&s;t much &s;plendour of elo|quence, contained much pernicious doctrine, and had provoked on the other &s;ide a very mi&s;|chievous an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke was probably the more ready to notice this attack, becau&s;e the topicks were the &s;ame with tho&s;e, of which he had complained much in private, as having been unfairly in|troduced in &s;ome of the State-Trials. In one of them e&s;pecially, having been &s;ummoned as a witne&s;s &s;oon after the lo&s;s of his &s;on, having much again&s;t his will been kept in hourly atten|dance for two whole days in the neighbourhood of the Court, and having then been di&s;charged without examination, he was much &s;urpri&s;ed to read afterwards, that a principal part of the defence had con&s;i&s;ted in commenting upon various extracts from his works; and, by a
<PB N="lxviii" REF="67">
learned per&s;on too, who had never taken up any of the challenges, which he had him&s;elf repeatedly thrown out, where the truth might have been fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed face to face, in the Hou&s;e of Commons. Perhaps al&s;o, there were &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances of the time, which did not di&s;po&s;e him in general to regard the Noble Duke's con|duct in Parliament with much indulgence. All the&s;e may be traced in the plea&s;ant, though &s;e|vere, cha&s;ti&s;ement of the letter which forms the &s;econd part of this publication. But it is chiefly worthy of attention, as it contains, in their very germ and &s;eed, tho&s;e notions, which are un|folded and di&s;played in his later productions with &s;o much luxuriant beauty. It is a ma&s;terly drawing, from which he afterwards painted on a larger canvas his grand and &s;triking pictures of our awful &s;ituation, ari&s;ing out of what he thought the fal&s;e policy of both our contending parties. As he would not &s;urrender to his long friend&s;hip with Mr. Fox tho&s;e principles, which he had him&s;elf modelled for his party, and which he
<PB N="lxix" REF="68">
had unalterably fixed as his own canon long be|fore that party had an exi&s;tence; &s;o neither from a &s;en&s;e of recent obligation to Mr. Pitt, would he accommodate them to the fluctuating chances of a campaign, or the accidental languor and la&s;&s;itude of a people, which, like every high|&s;pirited people too long repre&s;&s;ed, is only to be animated by a congenial character of deci&s;ion, energy, and enterpri&s;e. Before the actual ag|gre&s;&s;ion of the French he had &s;aid; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is impo&s;&s;ible to tell what will be the event of any war: it is impo&s;&s;ible to tell, how it will be conducted either by mini&s;ters or military men: yet with all the&s;e dreadful uncertainties, I am clear it mu&s;t be ri&s;ked, or our ruin is no un|certainty at all."</Q> In the cour&s;e of our ar|duous conte&s;t, he &s;aw no indication of any e&s;&s;ential change in the di&s;po&s;ition and principles of the common enemy; the real danger again&s;t which we were driven, unwilling as we were, to &s;eek &s;afety in arms. He &s;aw therefore no pro&s;|pect of a rationally &s;ecure peace, which is the
<PB N="lxx" REF="69">
only end of any ju&s;tifiable war, in whatever cau&s;e undertaken. Till the calamities of war by the le&s;&s;ons of that terrible nece&s;&s;ity, which is the &s;tern but faithful guardian of the moral and &s;ocial world, &s;hall have taught the di&s;turbers and de|&s;troyers of Europe to look for their own hap|pine&s;s in the truly pacifick mind, which re&s;pects the rights of others, all negociations and trea|ties appeared to him but &s;nares to catch cre|dulity, and &s;creens to conceal the &s;hame of pu&s;illanimity. With mo&s;t of the dreadful un|certainties of war now become, in his opinion, afflicting certainties, he thought that we mu&s;t per&s;evere. To the great talents of the Mini&s;ter he bore invariable te&s;timony, but he could never allow, that to humiliate and pro&s;trate a great nation at the feet of an in&s;olent and ran|courous enemy, was the conduct of a &s;tate&s;man, equal to the mighty cri&s;is, which ought to render us for ever worthy of our rank among the &s;tates of Europe, or for ever glorious in our fall. He wi&s;hed them to be &s;timulated and urged on
<PB N="lxxi" REF="70">
to a more re&s;olute di&s;charge of their high duty, by all of independent &s;pirit and virtue, that can be found in the country; yet, at the &s;ame time, he wi&s;hed their continuance in power, becau&s;e in whatever hands the pre&s;ent alarming &s;ituation of the civilized world had found the govern|ment of the kingdom, to have wre&s;ted it from them by force would have put all good govern|ment to the hazard; and becau&s;e they have no competitors for publick confidence on the grounds of our ancient, appropriate, local in|tere&s;ts, in connexion with that &s;y&s;tem on which the liberties, the tranquillity, and the pro&s;perity of Europe have hitherto re&s;ted. The&s;e &s;entiments did not leave him but with his breath. He te&s;tified them on the la&s;t day of his life, in the la&s;t conver&s;ation which he held, hardly an hour before his di&s;&s;olution. If with the ex|pre&s;&s;ion of them in his di&s;putes with the political friends of his earlier days, he ever mingled <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"any thing of general human infirmity, or his own particular infirmity,"</Q> as he &s;aid with his accu&s;|tomed
<PB N="lxxii" REF="71">
humility in the will, which he wrote with his own hand, almo&s;t over the dead body of his Son, and which he confirmed in the full and near contemplation of his own death,&mdash;he has a&s;ked their forgivene&s;s. On the other &s;ide he had no forgivene&s;s to a&s;k. To have &s;uppo&s;ed, that by the grants which his Sovereign was advi&s;ed to confer upon him, the Mini&s;ter meant to purcha&s;e his &s;ilence, would not only have been contrary to the kind and generous manner, in which they were &s;ignified to him; it would have been to incur the guilt of the blacke&s;t ingratitude by &s;uppo&s;ing, that under the colour of rewarding his &s;ervices to his country, they were in&s;idiou&s;ly given to tarni&s;h and ob&s;cure the lu&s;tre of all his pa&s;t life.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER TO THE DUKE OF PORTLAND, WITH OBSERVATIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF THE MINORITY, PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST SESSION OF PARLIAMENT, 1793.</HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB REF="73">
<HEAD>TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF PORTLAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Paper which I take the liberty of &s;ending to Your Grace, was, for the greater part, written during the la&s;t Se&s;|&s;ion. A few days after the prorogation &s;ome few ob&s;ervations were added. I was however re&s;olved to let it lie by me for a con&s;iderable time; that on viewing the matter at a proper di&s;tance, and when the &s;harpne&s;s of recent impre&s;&s;ions had been worn off, I might be better able to form a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the va|lue of my fir&s;t opinions.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="74">
I have ju&s;t now read it over very coolly and deliberately. My late&s;t judgment owns my fir&s;t &s;entiments and rea&s;onings, in their full force, with regard both to per&s;ons and things.</P>
<P>During a period of four years, the &s;tate of the world, except for &s;ome few and &s;hort in|tervals, has filled me with a good deal of &s;erious inquietude. I con&s;idered a general war again&s;t Jacobins and Jacobini&s;m, as the only po&s;&s;ible chance of &s;aving Europe (and England as included in Europe) from a truly frightful Revolution. For this I have been cen&s;ured, as receiving, through weakne&s;s, or of &s;preading, through fraud and artifice, a fal&s;e alarm. Whatever others may think of the matter, that alarm, in my mind, is by no means quieted. The &s;tate of affairs <HI>abroad</HI> is not &s;o much mended, as to make me, for one, full of confidence. At <HI>home,</HI> I &s;ee no abatement what&s;oever in the zeal' of the Par|ti&s;ans of Jacobini&s;m towards their cau&s;e, nor any ce&s;&s;ation in their efforts to do mi&s;chief. What is doing by Lord Lauderdale on the fir&s;t &s;cene of Lord George Gordon's actions,
<PB N="5" REF="75">
and in his &s;pirit, is not calculated to remove my apprehen&s;ions. They pur&s;ue their fir&s;t object with as much eagerne&s;s as ever, but with more dexterity. Under the plau&s;ible name of peace, by which they delude or are deluded, they would deliver us unarmed, and defencele&s;s, to the confederation of Jacobins, who&s;e center is indeed in France, but who&s;e rays proceed in every direction throughout the world. I under&s;tand that Mr. Coke, of Norfolk, has been lately very bu&s;y in &s;pread|ing a di&s;&s;affection to this War (which we carry on for our being) in the country in which his property gives him &s;o great an in|fluence. It is truly alarming to &s;ee &s;o large a part of the ari&s;tocratick intere&s;t engaged in the cau&s;e of the new &s;pecies of democracy, which is openly attacking, or &s;ecretly under|mining, the &s;y&s;tem of property by which mankind has hitherto been governed. But we are not to delude our&s;elves. No man can be connected with a party, which profe&s;&s;es publickly to admire, or may be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;|pected of &s;ecretly abetting, this French Re|volution, who mu&s;t not be drawn into its vortex, and become the in&s;trument of its de&s;igns.</P>

What I have written is in the manner of apology. I have given it that form, as being the mo&s;t re&s;pectful; but I do not &s;tand in need of any apology for my principles, my &s;entiments, or my conduct. I wi&s;h the paper I lay before your Grace, to be con&s;idered as my mo&s;t deliberate, &s;olemn, and even Te&s;ta|mentary Prote&s;t; again&s;t the proceedings and doctrines which have hitherto produced &s;o much mi&s;chief in the world, and which will infallibly produce more, and po&s;&s;ibly greater. It is my prote&s;t again&s;t the delu&s;ion, by which &s;ome have been taught to look upon this Jacobin conte&s;t at home, as an ordinary party &s;quabble about place or patronage; and to regard this Jacobin War abroad as a common War about trade or territorial boundaries, or about a political balance of power among rival or jealous &s;tates: Above all, it is my prote&s;t again&s;t that mi&s;take or perver&s;ion of &s;entiment, by which they who agree with us in our prin|ciples, may on collateral con&s;iderations be re|garded as enemies; and tho&s;e who, in this perilous cri&s;is of all human affairs, differ from us fundamentally and practically, as our be&s;t friends. Thus per&s;ons of great importance

may be made to turn the whole of their in|fluence to the de&s;truction of their prin|ciples.</P>
<P>I now make it my humble reque&s;t to your Grace, that you will not give any &s;ort of an&s;wer to the paper I &s;end, or to this Letter, except barely to let me know that you have received them. I even wi&s;h that at pre&s;ent you may not read the paper which I tran&s;mit; lock it up in the drawer of your library table; and when a day of compul&s;ory reflection comes, then be plea&s;ed to turn to it. Then remember that your Grace had a true friend, who had, comparatively with men of your de&s;cription, a very &s;mall intere&s;t in oppo&s;ing the modern &s;y&s;tem of morality and policy; but who under every di&s;couragement, was faithful to publick duty and to private friend&s;hip. I &s;hall then probably be dead. I am &s;ure I do not wi&s;h to live to &s;ee &s;uch things. But whil&s;t I do live, I &s;hall pur&s;ue the &s;ame cour&s;e; although my merits &s;hould be taken for unpardonable faults, and as &s;uch avenged, not only on my|&s;elf, but on my po&s;terity.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>APPROACHING towards the clo&s;e of a long period of publick &s;ervice, it is natural I &s;hould be de&s;irous to &s;tand well (I hope I do &s;tand tolerably well) with that public, which, with whatever fortune, I have endeavoured faithfully and zealou&s;ly, to &s;erve.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o not a little anxious for &s;ome place in the e&s;timation of the two per&s;ons to whom I addre&s;s this paper. I have always acted with them, and with tho&s;e whom they repre&s;ent. To my knowledge I have not deviated, no not in the minute&s;t point, from their opinions and principles. Of late, without any alter|ation in their &s;entiments, or in mine, a dif|ference of a very unu&s;ual nature, and which,
<PB N="10" REF="80">
under the circum&s;tances, it is not ea&s;y to de|&s;cribe, has ari&s;en between us.</P>
<P>In my journey with them through life, I met Mr. Fox in my road; and I travelled with him very chearfully as long as he ap|peared to me to pur&s;ue the &s;ame direction with tho&s;e in who&s;e company I &s;et out. In the latter &s;tage of our progre&s;s, a new &s;cheme of liberty and equality was produced in the world, which either dazzled his imagination, or was &s;uited to &s;ome new walks of ambition, which were then opened to his view. The whole frame and fa&s;hion of his politics appear to have &s;uffered about that time a very ma|terial alteration. It is about three years &s;ince, in con&s;equence of that extraordinary change, that, after a pretty long preceding period of di&s;tance, coolne&s;s, and want of confidence, if not total alienation on his part, a compleat public &s;eparation has been made between that gentleman and me. Until lately the breach between us appeared reparable. I tru&s;ted that time and reflexion, and a deci&s;ive experience of the mi&s;chie&s;s which have flowed from the proceedings and the &s;y&s;tem of France, on which our difference had ari&s;en, as well as the
<PB N="11" REF="81">
known &s;entiments of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of our common friends upon that &s;ubject, would have brought him to a &s;afer way of thinking. Several of his friends &s;aw no &s;ecurity for keep|ing things in a proper train after this excur&s;ion of his, but in the reunion of the party on its old grounds, under the Duke of Portland. Mr. Fox, if he plea&s;ed, might have been com|prehended in that &s;y&s;tem, with the rank and con&s;ideration to which his great talents entitle him, and indeed mu&s;t &s;ecure to him in any party arrangement that <HI>could</HI> be made. The Duke of Portland knows how much I wi&s;hed for, and how earne&s;tly I laboured that re-union, and upon terms that might every way be honourable and advantageous to Mr. Fox.&mdash;His conduct in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion has extingui&s;hed the&s;e hopes for ever.</P>
<P>Mr. Fox has lately publi&s;hed in print, a defence of his conduct. On taking into con|&s;ideration that defence, a &s;ociety of gentle|men, called the Whig Club, thought proper to come to the following re&s;olution&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That their confidence in Mr. Fox is confirmed, &s;trengthened, and increa&s;ed, by the calumnies again&s;t him."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="82">
To that re&s;olution my two noble friends, the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam, have given their concurrence.</P>
<P>The calumnies &s;uppo&s;ed in that re&s;olution, can be nothing el&s;e than the objections taken to Mr. Fox's conduct in this &s;e&s;&s;ion of Par|liament; for to them, and to them alone, the re&s;olution refers. I am one of tho&s;e who have publickly and &s;trongly urged tho&s;e objections. I hope I &s;hall be thought only to do what is nece&s;&s;ary to my ju&s;tification, thus publickly, &s;olemnly, and heavily cen&s;ured by tho&s;e whom I mo&s;t value and e&s;teem, when I firmly con|tend, that the objections which I, with many others of the friends to the Duke of Portland, have made to Mr. Fox's conduct, are not <HI>ca|lumnies,</HI> but founded on truth; that they are not <HI>few,</HI> but many; and that they are not <HI>light and trivial,</HI> but in a very high degree, &s;erious and important.</P>
<P>That I may avoid the imputation of throw|ing out, even privately, any loo&s;e random imputations again&s;t the public conduct of a gentleman, for whom I once entertained a very warm affection, and who&s;e abilities I
<PB N="13" REF="83">
regard with the greate&s;t admiration, I will put down di&s;tinctly and articulately, &s;ome of the matters of objection which I feel to his late doctrines and proceedings, tru&s;ting that I &s;hall be able to demon&s;trate to the friends, who&s;e good opinion I would &s;till cultivate, that not levity, nor caprice, nor le&s;s defen&s;ible motives, but that very grave rea&s;ons influence my judgment. I think that the &s;pirit of his late proceedings is wholly alien to our national policy, and to the peace, to the pro&s;perity, and to the legal liberties of this nation, <HI>ac|cording to our ancient dome&s;tic and appropriated mode of holding them.</HI></P>
<P>Viewing things in that light, my confi|dence in him is not encrea&s;ed, but totally de&s;troyed by tho&s;e proceedings. I cannot conceive it a matter of honour or duty (but the direct contrary) in any member of par|liament, to continue &s;y&s;tematick oppo&s;ition for the purpo&s;e of putting Government under dif|ficulties, until Mr. Fox (with all his pre&s;ent ideas) &s;hall have the principal direction of af|fairs placed in his hands; and until the pre|&s;ent body of admini&s;tration (with their ideas
<PB N="14" REF="84">
and mea&s;ures) is of cour&s;e overturned and di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>To come to particulars:</P>
<P N="1">1. The Laws and Con&s;titution of the King|dom, entru&s;t the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right of treating with foreign potentates, to the King. This is an undi&s;puted part of the legal pre|rogative of the Crown. However, notwith|&s;tanding this, Mr. Fox, without the know|ledge or participation of any one per&s;on in the Hou&s;e of Commons, with whom he was bound by every party principle, in matters of deli|cacy and importance, confidentially to com|municate, thought proper to &s;end Mr. Adair, as his repre&s;entative, and with his cypher, to St. Peter&s;burgh, there to fru&s;trate the objects for which the Mini&s;ter from the Crown was authorized to treat. He &s;ucceeded in this his de&s;ign, and did actually fru&s;trate the King's Mini&s;ter in &s;ome of the objects of his nego|ciation.</P>
<P>This proceeding of Mr. Fox does not (as I conceive) amount to ab&s;olute high trea&s;on; Ru&s;&s;ia, though on bad terms, not having
<PB N="15" REF="85">
been then declaredly at war with this king|dom. But &s;uch a proceeding is, in law, not very remote from that offence, and is un|doubtedly a mo&s;t uncon&s;titutional act, and an high trea&s;onable mi&s;demeanor.</P>
<P>The legitimate and &s;ure mode of commu|nication between this nation and foreign powers, is rendered uncertain, precarious, and treacherous, by being divided into two channels, one with the Government, one with the head of a party in Oppo&s;ition to that Go|vernment; by which means the foreign powers can never be a&s;&s;ured of the real au|thority or validity of any public tran&s;action what&s;oever.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the advantage taken of the di&s;content which at that time prevailed in parliament and in the nation, to give to an individual an influence directly again&s;t the Government of his country, in a foreign court, has made a highway into England for the intrigues of foreign courts in our affairs. This is a &s;ore evil; an evil from which, before this time, England was more free than any other nation. Nothing can
<PB N="16" REF="86">
pre&s;erve us from that evil&mdash;which connects cabinet factions abroad with popular factions here,&mdash;but the keeping &s;acred the Crown, as the only channel of communication with every other nation.</P>
<P>This proceeding of Mr. Fox has given a &s;trong countenance and an encouraging ex|ample to the doctrines and practices of the Revolution and Con&s;titutional Societies, and of other mi&s;chievous &s;ocieties of that de|&s;cription, who, without any legal authority, and even without any corporate capacity, are in the habit of propo&s;ing, and to the be&s;t of their power, of forming leagues and alliances with France.</P>
<P>This proceeding, which ought to be re|probated on all the general principles of go|vernment, is, in a more narrow view of things, not le&s;s reprehen&s;ible. It tends to the prejudice of the whole of the Duke of Portland's late party, by di&s;crediting the principles upon which they &s;upported Mr. Fox in the Ru&s;&s;ian bu&s;ine&s;s, as if they, of that party al&s;o, had proceeded in their parlia|mentary oppo&s;ition, on the &s;ame mi&s;chievous
<PB N="17" REF="87">
principles which actuated Mr. Fox in &s;end|ing Mr. Adair on his emba&s;&s;y.</P>
<P N="2">2. Very &s;oon after his &s;ending this em|ba&s;&s;y to Ru&s;&s;ia, that is, in the Spring of 1792, a covenanting club or a&s;&s;ociation was formed in London, calling it&s;elf by the am|bitious and invidious title of "<HI>The Friends of the People.</HI>" It was compo&s;ed of many of Mr. Fox's own mo&s;t intimate, per&s;onal, and party friends, joined to a very con&s;iderable part of the members of tho&s;e mi&s;chievous a&s;&s;ociations called the Revolution Society, and the Con&s;titutional Society. Mr. Fox mu&s;t have been well apprized of the progre&s;s of that &s;ociety, in every one of its &s;teps; if not of the very origin of it. I certainly was informed of both, who had no connexion with the de&s;ign, directly or indirectly. His influence over the per&s;ons who compo&s;ed the leading part in that a&s;&s;ociation, was, and is unbounded. I hear, that he expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;approbation of this club in one ca&s;e, (that of Mr. St. John) where his con&s;ent was formally a&s;ked; yet he never attempted &s;eriou&s;ly to put a &s;top to the a&s;&s;ociation, or to di&s;avow it, or to controul, check, or modify
<PB N="18" REF="88">
it in any way what&s;oever. If he had plea&s;ed, without difficulty, he might have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it in its beginning. However, he did not only not &s;uppre&s;s it in its beginning, but encou|raged it in every part of its progre&s;s, at that particular time, when Jacobin Clubs (under the very &s;ame, or &s;imilar titles) were making &s;uch dreadful havock in a country not thirty miles from the coa&s;t of England, and when every motive of moral prudence called for the di&s;couragement of &s;ocieties formed for the encrea&s;e of popular preten&s;ions to power and direction.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the proceedings of this &s;ociety of the Friends of the People, as well as others acting in the &s;ame &s;pirit, had cau&s;ed a very &s;erious alarm in the mind of the Duke of Portland, and of many good patriots, he publickly, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, treated their apprehen&s;ions and conduct with the greate&s;t a&s;perity and ridicule. He condemned and vilified, in the mo&s;t in&s;ulting and out|rageous terms, the proclamation i&s;&s;ued by Go|vernment on that occa&s;ion&mdash;though he well knew, that it had pa&s;&s;ed through the Duke of Portland's hands, that it had received his
<PB N="19" REF="89">
fulle&s;t approbation, and that it was the re|&s;ult of an actual interview between that noble Duke and Mr. Pitt. During the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of its merits in the Hou&s;e of Commons, Mr. Fox countenanced and ju&s;tified the chief promoters of that a&s;&s;ociation; and he re|ceived in return, a publick a&s;&s;urance from them of an inviolable adherence to him, &s;ingly and per&s;onally. On account of this proceeding, a very great number (I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, not the lea&s;t grave and wi&s;e part) of the Duke of Portland's friends in Parliament, and many out of Parliament, who are of the &s;ame de&s;cription, have become &s;eparated from that time to this from Mr. Fox's particular Cabal; very few of which Cabal are, or ever have, &s;o much as pretended to be attached to the Duke of Portland, or to pay any re&s;pect to him or his opinions.</P>
<P N="4">4. At the beginning of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, when the &s;ober part of the nation was a &s;econd time generally and ju&s;tly alarmed at the pro|gre&s;s of the French arms on the Continent, and at the &s;preading of their horrid princi|ples and cabals in England, Mr. Fox did not (as had been u&s;ual in ca&s;es of far le&s;s
<PB N="20" REF="90">
moment) call together any meeting of the Duke of Portland's friends in the Hou&s;e of Commons, for the purpo&s;e of taking their opinion on the conduct to be pur&s;ued in Par|liament at that critical Juncture. He con|certed his mea&s;ures (if with any per&s;ons at all) with the friends of Lord Lan&s;downe, and tho&s;e calling them&s;elves Friends of the People, and others not in the &s;malle&s;t de|gree attached to the Duke of Portland; by which conduct he wilfully gave up (in my opinion) all preten&s;ions to be con&s;idered as of that party, and much more to be con|&s;idered as the Leader and Mouth of it in the Hou&s;e of Commons. This could not give much encouragement to tho&s;e who had been &s;eparated from Mr. Fox, on account of his conduct on the fir&s;t proclamation, to rejoin that party.</P>
<P N="5">5. Not having con&s;ulted any of the Duke of Portlands party in the Hou&s;e of Commons; and not having con&s;ulted them, becau&s;e he had rea&s;on to know, that the cour&s;e he had re&s;olved to pur&s;ue would be highly di&s;agreeable to them, he repre&s;ented the alarm, which was a &s;econd time given and taken, in &s;till more invidious
<PB N="21" REF="91">
colours than tho&s;e in which he painted the alarms of the former year. He de&s;cribed tho&s;e alarms in this manner, although the cau&s;e of them was then grown far le&s;s equi|vocal, and far more urgent. He even went &s;o far as to treat the &s;uppo&s;ition of the growth of a Jacobin &s;pirit in England as a libel on the nation. As to the danger from <HI>abroad,</HI> on the fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, he &s;aid little or nothing upon the &s;ubject. He contented him&s;elf with defending the ruling factions in France, and with accu&s;ing the publick Councils of this kingdom of every &s;ort of evil de&s;ign on the liberties of the people; declaring di&s;tinctly, &s;trongly, and preci&s;ely, that the whole danger of the nation was from the growth of the Power of the Crown. The policy of this de|claration was obvious. It was in &s;ub&s;ervience to the general plan of di&s;abling us from taking any &s;teps again&s;t France. To counteract the alarm given by the progre&s;s of Jacobin arms and principles, he endeavoured to excite an oppo&s;ite alarm concerning the growth of the Power of the Crown. If that alarm &s;hould prevail, he knew that the nation never would be brought by arms to oppo&s;e the growth of the Jacobin empire; becau&s;e it is obvious that
<PB N="22" REF="92">
war does, in its very nature, nece&s;&s;itate the Commons con&s;iderably to &s;trengthen the hands of Government; and if that &s;trength &s;hould it&s;elf be the object of terrour, we could have no war.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the extraordinary and violent &s;peeches of that day, he attributed all the evils which the publick had &s;uffered, to the Proclamation of the preceding &s;ummer; though he &s;poke in pre&s;ence of the Duke of Portland's own &s;on, the Marquis of Titchfield, who had &s;econded the Addre&s;s on that Proclamation; and in pre&s;ence of the Duke of Portland's brother, Lord Edward Bentinck, and &s;e|veral others of his be&s;t friends and neare&s;t relations.</P>
<P N="7">7. On that day, that is, on the 13th of December, 1792, he propo&s;ed an amendment to the Addre&s;s, which &s;tands on the Journals of the Hou&s;e, and which is, perhaps, the mo&s;t extraordinary record which ever did &s;tand upon them. To introduce this amendment, he not only &s;truck out the part of the propo&s;ed Addre&s;s which alluded to in&s;urrections, upon the ground of the objections which he took
<PB N="23" REF="93">
to the legality of calling together Parlia|ment, (objections which I mu&s;t ever think litigious and &s;ophi&s;tical) but he likewi&s;e &s;truck out that <HI>part which related to the Cabals and Con&s;piracies of the French Faction in England,</HI> although their practices and corre&s;pondences were of public notoriety. Mr. Cooper and Mr. Watt had been deputed from Manche&s;ter to the Jacobins. The&s;e amba&s;&s;adors were re|ceived by them as Briti&s;h Repre&s;entatives. Other deputations of Engli&s;h had been re|ceived at the bar of the National A&s;&s;embly. They had gone the length of giving &s;upplies to the Jacobin armies; and they in return had received promi&s;es of military a&s;&s;i&s;tance to for|ward their de&s;igns in England. A regular corre&s;pondence for fraternizing the two na|tions had al&s;o been carried on by &s;ocieties in London with a great number of the Jacobin &s;ocieties in France. This corre&s;pondence had al&s;o for its object the pretended improvement of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution.&mdash;What is the mo&s;t remarkable, and by much the more mi&s;chiev|ous part of his proceedings that day, Mr. Fox likewi&s;e &s;truck out every thing in the Addre&s;s which <HI>related to the lokens of Ambilion given by France, her aggre&s;&s;ions upon our allies, and the</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="94">
<HI>&s;udden and dangerous growth of her power upon every &s;ide;</HI> and in&s;tead of all tho&s;e weighty, and at that time, nece&s;&s;ary matters, by which the Hou&s;e of Commons was (in a cri&s;is, &s;uch as perhaps Europe never &s;tood) to give a&s;&s;u|rances to our allies, &s;trength to our Govern|ment, and a check to the common enemy of Europe, he &s;ub&s;tituted nothing but a criminal charge on the conduct of the Briti&s;h Govern|ment for calling Parliament together, and an engagement to enquire into that conduct.</P>
<P N="8">8. If it had plea&s;ed God to &s;uffer him to &s;ucceed in this his project, for the amendment to the Addre&s;s, he would for ever have ruined this nation, along with the re&s;t of Europe. At home all the Jacobin &s;ocieties, formed for the utter de&s;truction of our Con&s;titution, would have lifted up their heads, which had been beaten down by the two Proclamations. Tho&s;e &s;ocieties would have been infinitely &s;trengthened and multiplied in every quarter; their dangerous foreign communications would have been left broad and open; the Crown would not have been authorized to take any mea&s;ure whatever for our immediate defence by &s;ea or land. The clo&s;e&s;t, the mo&s;t natural,
<PB N="25" REF="95">
the neare&s;t, and, at the &s;ame time, from many internal as well as external circum&s;tances, the weake&s;t of our allies, Holland, would have been given up, bound hand and foot, to France, ju&s;t on the point of invading that republick. A general con&s;ternation would have &s;eized upon all Europe; and all alliance with every other power, except France, would have been for ever rendered impracticable to us. I think it impo&s;&s;ible for any man, who regards the dignity and &s;afety of his country, or indeed the common &s;afety of mankind, ever to forget Mr. Fox's proceedings in that tremendous cri&s;is of all human affairs.</P>
<P N="9">9. Mr. Fox very &s;oon had rea&s;on to be appri&s;ed of the general di&s;like of the Duke of Portland's friends to this conduct. Some of tho&s;e who had even voted with him, the day after their vote expre&s;&s;ed their abhor|rence of his amendment, their &s;en&s;e of its inevitable tendency, and their total aliena|tion from the principles and maxims upon which it was made; yet, the very next day, that is, on Friday, the 14th of December, he brought on what in effect was the very &s;ame
<PB N="26" REF="96">
bu&s;ine&s;s, and on the &s;ame principles, a <HI>&s;e|cond</HI> time.</P>
<P N="10">10. Although the Hou&s;e does not u&s;ually fit on Saturday, he a <HI>third</HI> time brought on another propo&s;ition, in the &s;ame &s;pirit, and pur&s;ued it with &s;o much heat and per&s;everance as to &s;it into Sunday; a thing not known in Parliament for many years.</P>
<P N="11">11. In all the&s;e motions and debates he wholly departed from all the political prin|ciples relative to France, (con&s;idered merely as a &s;tate, and independent of its Jacobin form of government) which had hitherto been held fundamental in this country, and which he had him&s;elf held more &s;trongly than any man in Parliament. He at that time &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;eparated him&s;elf from tho&s;e to who&s;e &s;entiments he u&s;ed to profe&s;s no &s;mall regard, although tho&s;e &s;entiments were pub|lickly declared. I had then no concern in the party, having been for &s;ome time, with all outrage, excluded from it; but, on ge|neral principles, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that a per&s;on who a&s;&s;umes to be leader of a party com|po&s;ed of freemen and of gentlemen, ought to
<PB N="27" REF="97">
pay &s;ome degree of deference to their feel|ings, and even to their prejudices. He ought to have &s;ome degree of management for their credit and influence in their country. He &s;hewed &s;o very little of this delicacy, that he compared the alarm rai&s;ed in the minds of the Duke of Portland's party, (which was his own) an alarm in which they &s;ym|pathized with the greater part of the nation, to the panick produced by the pretended Popi&s;h plot in the reign of Charles the Second&mdash;de&s;cribing it to be, as that was, a contriv|ance of knaves, and believed only by well|meaning dupes and madmen.</P>
<P N="12">12. The Monday following, (the 17th of December) he pur&s;ued the &s;ame conduct. The means u&s;ed in England to co-operate with the Jacobin army in politicks, agreed with their modes of proceeding; I allude to the mi&s;chievous writings circulated with much indu&s;try and &s;ucce&s;s, as well as the &s;e|ditious clubs, which at that time, added not a little to the alarm taken by ob&s;erving and well-informed men. The writings and the clubs were two evils which marched together. Mr. Fox di&s;covered the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;|po&s;ition
<PB N="28" REF="98">
to favour and countenance the one as well as the other of the&s;e two grand in&s;tru|ments of the French &s;y&s;tem. He would hardly con&s;ider any political writing what&s;oever, as a libel, or as a fit object of pro&s;ecution. At a time in which the pre&s;s has been the grand in&s;trument of the &s;ubver&s;ion of order, of mo|rals, of religion, and I may &s;ay of human &s;o|ciety it&s;elf, to carry the doctrines of its liberty higher than ever it has been known by its mo&s;t extravagant a&s;&s;ertors even in France, gave oc|ca&s;ion to very &s;erious reflections. Mr. Fox treated the a&s;&s;ociations for pro&s;ecuting the&s;e libels, as tending to prevent the improvement of the human mind, and as a mobbi&s;h tyranny. He thought proper to compare them with the riotous a&s;&s;emblies of Lord George Gordon in 1780, declaring that he had advi&s;ed his friends in We&s;tmin&s;ter, to &s;ign the a&s;&s;ociations whe|ther they agreed to them or not, in order that they might avoid de&s;truction to their per&s;ons or their hou&s;es, or a de&s;ertion of their &s;hops. This in&s;idious advice tended to confound tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to the object of the a&s;&s;ocia|tion, with the &s;editious, again&s;t whom the a&s;&s;ociation was directed. By this &s;tratagem, the confederacy intended for pre&s;erving the
<PB N="29" REF="99">
Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and the public peace, would be wholly defeated. The magi&s;trates, utterly incapable of di&s;tingui&s;hing the friends from the enemies of order, would in vain look for &s;upport when they &s;tood in the greate&s;t need of it.</P>
<P N="13">13. Mr. Fox's whole conduct, on this oc|ca&s;ion, was without example. The very morn|ing after the&s;e violent declamations in the Hou&s;e of Commons again&s;t the a&s;&s;ociation, (that is on Tue&s;day the 18th) he went him&s;elf to a meeting of St. George's pari&s;h, and there &s;igned an a&s;&s;ociation of the nature and ten|dency of tho&s;e he had the night before &s;o ve|hemently condemned; and &s;everal of his par|ticular and mo&s;t intimate friends, inhabitants of that pari&s;h, attended and &s;igned along with him.</P>
<P N="14">14. Immediately after this extraordinary &s;tep, and in order perfectly to defeat the ends of that a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t Jacobin publica|tions, (which, contrary to his opinions, he had promoted and &s;igned) a mi&s;chievous &s;o|ciety was formed under his au&s;pices, called, the <HI>Friends of the Liberty of the Pre&s;s.</HI> Their
<PB N="30" REF="100">
title groundle&s;sly in&s;inuated, that the freedom of the pre&s;s had lately &s;uffered, or was now threatened with &s;ome violation. This &s;ociety was only, in reality, another modification of the &s;ociety calling it&s;elf the <HI>Friends of the People,</HI> which, in the preceding &s;ummer had cau&s;ed &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s in the Duke of Portland's mind, and in the minds of &s;everal of his friends. This new &s;ociety was com|po&s;ed of many, if not mo&s;t of the members of the club of the <HI>Friends of the People,</HI> with the addition of a va&s;t multitude of others (&s;uch as Mr. Horne Tooke) of the wor&s;t and mo&s;t &s;editious di&s;po&s;itions that could be found in the whole kingdom. In the fir&s;t meeting of this club, Mr. Er&s;kine took the lead, and di|rectly (without any di&s;avowal ever &s;ince on Mr. Fox's part) <HI>made u&s;e of his name and au|thority in favour of its formation and purpo&s;es.</HI> In the &s;ame meeting Mr. Er&s;kine had thanks for his defence of <HI>Paine,</HI> which amounted to a complete avowal of that Jacobin incendiary; el&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to know how Mr. Er&s;kine &s;hould have de&s;erved &s;uch marked applau&s;es for acting merely as a lawyer for his fee, in the ordinary cour&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="15"><PB N="31" REF="101">
15. Indeed Mr. Fox appeared the general patron of all &s;uch per&s;ons and proceedings. When Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and other per&s;ons, for practices of the mo&s;t dangerous kind, in Paris and in London, were removed from the King's Guards, Mr. Fox took occa|&s;ion, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, heavily to cen&s;ure that act as unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive, and tending to make officers bad citizens. There were few, however, who did not call for &s;ome &s;uch mea&s;ures on the part of Government, as of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for the King's per&s;onal &s;afety, as well as that of the publick; and no|thing but the mi&s;taken lenity (with which &s;uch practices were rather di&s;countenanced than puni&s;hed) could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve repre|hen&s;ion in what was done with regard to tho&s;e gentlemen.</P>
<P N="16">16. Mr. Fox, regularly and &s;y&s;tematically, and with a diligence long unu&s;ual to him, did every thing he could to countenance the &s;ame principle of fraternity and connexion with the Jacobins abroad, and the National Con|vention of France, for which the&s;e officers had been removed from the Guards. For when a bill (feeble and lax indeed, and far &s;hort of
<PB N="32" REF="102">
the vigour required by the conjuncture) was brought in for removing out of the kingdom the emi&s;&s;aries of France, Mr. Fox oppo&s;ed it with all his might. He pur&s;ued a vehement and detailed oppo&s;ition to it through all its &s;tages, de&s;cribing it as a mea&s;ure contrary to the exi&s;ting treaties between Great Britain and France; as a violation of the law of nations, and as an outrage on the great charter it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="17">17. In the &s;ame manner, and with the &s;ame heat, he oppo&s;ed a bill, which, (though aukward and inartificial in its con&s;truction) was right and wi&s;e in its principle, and was precedented in the be&s;t times, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary at that juncture,&mdash;I mean the Trai|torous Corre&s;pondence Bill. By the&s;e means the enemy, rendered infinitely dangerous by the links of real faction and pretended com|merce, would have been (had Mr. Fox &s;uc|ceeded) enabled to carry on the war again&s;t us by our own re&s;ources. For this purpo&s;e that enemy would have had his agents and trai|tors in the mid&s;t of us.</P>
<P N="18">18. When at length war was actually de|clared, by the u&s;urpers in France, again&s;t this
<PB N="33" REF="103">
kingdom, and declared whil&s;t they were pre|tending a negociation through Dumourier with Lord Auckland, Mr. Fox &s;till continued, through the whole of the proceedings, to di&s;|credit the national honour and ju&s;tice, and to throw the entire blame of the war on Parlia|ment, and on his own country, as acting with violence, haughtine&s;s, and want of equity. He frequently a&s;&s;erted, both at the time and ever &s;ince, that the war, though declared by France, was provoked by us, and that it was wholly un|nece&s;&s;ary, and fundamentally unju&s;t.</P>
<P N="19">19. He has lo&s;t no opportunity of railing, in the mo&s;t virulent manner, and in the mo&s;t unmea&s;ured language, at every foreign power with whom we could now, or at any time, con|tract any u&s;eful or effectual alliance again&s;t France, declaring that he hoped no alliance with tho&s;e powers was made, or was in a train of being made<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is an exception, that in one of his la&s;t &s;peeches, (but not before) Mr. Fox &s;eemed to think, an alliance with Spain might be proper.</NOTE>. He always expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t horror concerning &s;uch alliances, &s;o did all his phalanx. Mr. Sheridan, in particular, after one of his invectives again&s;t tho&s;e powers,
<PB N="34" REF="104">
fitting by him, &s;aid, with manife&s;t marks of his approbation, that if we mu&s;t go to war, he had rather go to war alone than with &s;uch allies.</P>
<P N="20">20. Immediately after the French declaration of war again&s;t us, Parliament addre&s;&s;ed the King in &s;upport of the war again&s;t them, as ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, and provoked as well as formally declared again&s;t Great Britain. He did not divide the Hou&s;e upon this mea&s;ure; yet he immediately followed this our &s;olemn Parlia|mentary engagement to the King, with a motion propo&s;ing a &s;et of re&s;olutions, the effect of which was, that the two Hou&s;es were to load them&s;elves with every kind of reproach for having made the addre&s;s, which they had ju&s;t carried to the Throne. He commenced this long &s;tring of criminatory re&s;olutions again&s;t his country, (if King, Lords and Commons of Great Britain, and a decided majority without doors are his country) <HI>with a declaration again&s;t intermeddling in the interior concerns of France.</HI> The purport of this re&s;olution of non-interference, is a thing unexampled in the hi&s;tory of the world, when one nation has been actually at war with another. The be&s;t writers on the law of nations, give no
<PB N="35" REF="105">
&s;ort of countenance to his doctrine of non-inter|ference, in the extent and manner in which he u&s;ed it, <HI>even when there is no war.</HI> When the war exi&s;ts, not one authority is again&s;t it in all its latitude. His doctrine is equally contrary to the enemy's uniform practice, who, whether in peace or in war, makes it his great aim, not only to change the Government, but to make an entire revolution in the whole of the &s;ocial order in every country.</P>
<P>The object of the la&s;t of this extraordinary &s;tring of re&s;olutions moved by Mr. Fox, was to advi&s;e the Crown not to enter into &s;uch an engagement with any foreign power, &s;o as to hinder us from making a <HI>&s;eparate</HI> peace with France, or which might tend to enable any of tho&s;e powers to introduce a government in that country, other than &s;uch as tho&s;e per&s;ons whom he calls the people of France, &s;hall choo&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;h. In &s;hort, the whole of the&s;e re&s;olu|tions appeared to have but one drift&mdash;namely, the &s;acrifice of our own dome&s;tick dignity and &s;afety, and the independency of Europe, to the &s;upport of this &s;trange mixture of anarchy and tyranny which prevails in France, and which Mr. Fox and his party were plea&s;ed to call a
<PB N="36" REF="106">
Government. The immediate con&s;equences of the&s;e mea&s;ures was (by an example, the ill effects of which, on the whole world, are not to be calculated) to &s;ecure the robbers of the inno|cent nobility, gentry, and eccle&s;ia&s;ticks of France, in the enjoyment of the &s;poil they have made of the e&s;tates, hou&s;es, and goods of their fellow|citizens.</P>
<P N="21">21. Not &s;atisfied with moving the&s;e re&s;olu|tions, tending to confirm this horrible tyranny and robbery, and with actually dividing the Hou&s;e on the fir&s;t of the long &s;tring which they compo&s;ed, in a few days afterwards he encou|raged and &s;upported Mr. Grey in producing the very &s;ame &s;trings in a new form, and in moving, under the &s;hape of an addre&s;s of Parliament to the Crown, another virulent libel on all its own proceedings in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, in which not only all the ground of the re&s;olutions was again travelled over, but much new inflammatory matter was introduced. In particular, a charge was made, that Great Britain had not interpo&s;ed to prevent the la&s;t partition of Poland. On this head the party dwelt very largely, and very vehemently. Mr. Fox's intention, in the choice of this ex|traordinary topic, was evident enough. He
<PB N="37" REF="107">
well knows two things; fir&s;t, that no wi&s;e or hone&s;t man can approve of that partition, or can contemplate it without progno&s;ticating great mi&s;|chief from it to all countries at &s;ome future time. Secondly, he knows quite as well, that, let our opinions on that partition be what they will, Eng|land, by it&s;elf, is not in a &s;ituation to afford to Poland any a&s;&s;i&s;tance what&s;oever. The purpo&s;e of the introduction of Poli&s;h politics into this di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, was not for the &s;ake of Poland; it was to throw an odium upon tho&s;e who are obliged to de|cline the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice from their impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;upporting a cau&s;e which they approve; as if we, who think more &s;trongly on this &s;ubject than he does, were of a party again&s;t Poland, becau&s;e we are obliged to act with &s;ome of the authors of that inju&s;tice, again&s;t our common enemy, France. But the great and leading purpo&s;e of this introduction of Poland into the debates on the French war, was to divert the public atten|tion from what was in our power, that is, from a &s;teady co-operation again&s;t France, to a quarrel with the Allies for the &s;ake of a Poli&s;h war, which, for any u&s;eful purpo&s;e to Poland, he knew it was out of our power to make. If England can touch Poland ever &s;o remotely, it mu&s;t be through the medium of alliances.
<PB N="38" REF="108">
But by attacking all the combined powers toge|ther for their &s;uppo&s;ed unju&s;t aggre&s;&s;ion upon France, he bound them by a new common inte|re&s;t, not &s;eparately to join England for the re&s;|cue of Poland. The propo&s;ition could only mean to do what all the writers of his party in the Morning Chronicle have aimed at per&s;uading the public to, through the whole of the la&s;t au|tumn and winter, and to this hour; that is, to an alliance with the Jacobins of France, for the pretended purpo&s;e of &s;uccouring Poland. This curious project would leave to Great Britain no other Ally in all Europe, except its old ene|my, France.</P>
<P N="22">22. Mr. Fox, after the fir&s;t day's di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on the que&s;tion for the addre&s;s, was at length driven to admit&mdash;(to admit rather than to urge, and that very faintly) that France had di&s;covered ambitious views, which none of his partizans, that I recollect, (Mr. Sheridan excepted) did, however, either urge or admit. What is re|markable enough, all the points admitted again&s;t the Jacobins, were brought to bear in their favour as much as tho&s;e in which they were defended. For when Mr. Fox admitted that the conduct of the Jacobins did di&s;cover ambi|tion,
<PB N="39" REF="109">
he always ended his admi&s;&s;ion of their am|bitious views by an apology for them, in&s;i&s;ting, that the univer&s;ally ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition &s;hewn to them, rendered their ambition a &s;ort of defen|&s;ive policy. Thus, on whatever roads he tra|velled, they all terminated in recommending a recognition of their pretended Republic, and in the plan of &s;ending an amba&s;&s;ador to it. This was the burthen of all his &s;ong&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Every thing which we could rea&s;onably hope from war, would be obtained from treaty."</Q> It is to be ob&s;erved, however, that in all the&s;e debates, Mr. Fox never once &s;tated to the Hou&s;e upon what ground it was he conceived, that all the objects of the French &s;y&s;tem of united fanatici&s;m and ambition would in&s;tantly be given up when|ever England &s;hould think fit to propo&s;e a treaty. On propo&s;ing &s;o &s;trange a recognition, and &s;o humiliating an emba&s;&s;y as he moved, he was bound to produce his authority, if any au|thority he had. He ought to have done this the rather, becau&s;e Le Brun, in his fir&s;t propo|&s;itions, and in his an&s;wers to Lord Grenville, defended, <HI>on principle, not on temporary conveni|ence,</HI> every thing which was objected to France, and &s;hewed not the &s;malle&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to give up any one of the points in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Mr.
<PB N="40" REF="110">
Fox mu&s;t al&s;o have known, that the Convention had pa&s;&s;ed to the order of the day, on a propo|&s;ition to give &s;ome &s;ort of explanation or modi|fication to the ho&s;tile decree of the 19th of November, for exciting in&s;urrections in all countries; a decree known to be peculiarly pointed at Great Britain. The whole proceeding of the French admini&s;tration was the mo&s;t re|mote that could be imagined from furni&s;hing any indication of a pacific di&s;po&s;ition: for at the very time in which it was pretended that the Jacobins entertained tho&s;e boa&s;ted pacific inten|tions, at the very time in which Mr. Fox was urging a treaty with them, not content with re|fu&s;ing a modification of the decree for in&s;ur|rections, they publi&s;hed their ever memorable decree of the 15th of December, 1792, for di&s;organizing every country in Europe, into which they &s;hould on any occa&s;ion &s;et their foot; and on the 25th and the 30th of the &s;ame month, they &s;olemnly, and on the la&s;t of the&s;e days, practically confirmed that de|cree.</P>
<P N="23">23. But Mr. Fox had him&s;elf taken good care in the negociation he propo&s;ed, that France &s;hould not be obliged to make any
<PB N="41" REF="111">
very great conce&s;&s;ions to her pre&s;umed mo|deration&mdash;for he had laid down one general comprehen&s;ive rule, with him (as he &s;aid) con&s;tant and inviolable. This rule, in fact, would not only have left to the faction in France, all the property and power they had u&s;urped at home, but mo&s;t, if not all, of the conque&s;ts which by their atrocious perfidy and violence, they had made abroad. The principle laid down by Mr. Fox, is this, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>That every &s;tate, in the conclu&s;ion of a war, has a right to avail it&s;elf of its conque&s;ts to|wards an indemnification.</HI>"</Q> This principle (true or fal&s;e) is totally contrary to the policy which this country has pur&s;ued with France, at various periods, particularly at the treaty of Ry&s;wick, in the la&s;t century, and at the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in this. Whatever the merits of his rule may be, in the eyes of neutral judges, it is a rule, which no &s;tate&s;man before him ever laid down in favour of the adver&s;e power with whom he was to negotiate. The adver&s;e party him&s;elf, may &s;afely be tru&s;ted to take care of his <HI>own</HI> aggrandizement. But (as if the black boxes of the&s;everal parties had been exchanged) Mr. Fox's Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, by &s;ome odd mi&s;take, would find him&s;elf
<PB N="42" REF="112">
cahrged with the concerns of France. If we were to leave France as &s;he &s;tood at the time when Mr. Fox propo&s;ed to treat with her, that formidable power mu&s;t have been infinitely &s;trengthened, and almo&s;t every other power in Europe as much weakened, by the extra|ordinary ba&s;is which he laid for a treaty. For Avignon mu&s;t go from the Pope; Savoy (at lea&s;t) from the King of Sardinia, if not Nice. Liege, Mentz, Salm, Deux Ponts, and B&acirc;le, mu&s;t be &s;eparated from Germany. On this &s;ide of the Rhine, Liege, at lea&s;t, mu&s;t be lo&s;t to the empire, and added to France. Mr. Fox's general principal fully covered all this. How much of the&s;e territories came within his rule, he never attempted to define. He kept a profound &s;ilence as to Germany. As to the Netherlands he was &s;omething more explicit. He &s;aid, (if I recollect right) that France, on that &s;ide, might expect &s;ome|thing towards &s;trengthening her frontier. As to the remaining parts of the Netherlands, which he &s;uppo&s;ed France might con&s;ent to &s;urrender, he went &s;o far as to declare that England ought not to permit the Emperor to be repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the remainder of the ten Provinces, but that <HI>the People</HI> &s;hould choo&s;e
<PB N="43" REF="113">
&s;uch a form of independent Government as they liked. This propo&s;ition of Mr. Fox was ju&s;t the arrangement which the u&s;urpa|tion in France had all along propo&s;ed to make. As the circum&s;tances were at that time, and have been ever &s;ince, his propo&s;ition fully indicated what Gevernment the Flem|mings <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have in the &s;tated extent of what was left to them. A Government &s;o &s;et up in the Netherlands, whether compul&s;ory, or by the choice of the Sans-Culottes, (who he well knew were to be the real electors, and the &s;ole electors) in whatever name it was to exi&s;t, mu&s;t evidently depend for its exi&s;t|ence, as it had done for its original forma|tion, on France. In reality, it mu&s;t have ended in that point, to which, piece by piece, the French were then actually bring|ing all the Netherlands; that is, an incor|poration with France, as a body of new departments, ju&s;t as Savoy and Liege, and the re&s;t of their pretended independent po|pular &s;overeignties, have been united to their republic. Such an arrangement mu&s;t have de&s;troyed Au&s;tria; it mu&s;t have left Holland always at the mercy of France; it mu&s;t totally and for ever cut off all political
<PB N="44" REF="114">
communication between England and the Continent. Such mu&s;t have been the &s;itua|tion of Europe, according to Mr. Fox's &s;y&s;tem of politicks, however laudable his per|&s;onal motives may have been in propo&s;ing &s;o complete a change in the whole &s;y&s;tem of Great Britain, with regard to all the Conti|nental powers.</P>
<P N="24">24. After it had been generally &s;uppo&s;ed that all publick bu&s;ine&s;s was over for the &s;e&s;|&s;ion, and that Mr. Fox had exhau&s;ted all the modes of pre&s;&s;ing this French &s;cheme, he thought proper to take a &s;tep beyond every expectation, and which demon&s;trated his wonderful eagerne&s;s and per&s;everance in his cau&s;e, as well as the nature and true character of the cau&s;e it&s;elf. This &s;tep was taken by Mr. Fox immediately after his giv|ing his a&s;&s;ent to the Grant of Supply voted to him by Mr. Serjeant Adair and a Com|mittee of Gentlemen, who a&s;&s;umed to them|&s;elves to act in the name of the publick. In the in&s;trument of his acceptance of this Grant, Mr. Fox took occa&s;ion to a&s;&s;ure them, that he would always per&s;evere <HI>in the &s;ame conduct</HI> which had procured to him &s;o honour|able
<PB N="45" REF="115">
a mark of the public approbation. He was as good as his word.</P>
<P N="25">25. It was not long before an opportunity was found, or made, for proving the &s;incerity of his profe&s;&s;ions, and demon&s;trating his gra|titude to tho&s;e who had given publick and un|equivocal marks of their approbation of his late conduct. One of the mo&s;t virulent of the Jacobin Faction, Mr. Gurney, a banker at Norwich, had all along di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf by his French politicks. By the means of this Gentleman, and of his a&s;&s;ociates of the &s;ame de&s;cription, one of the mo&s;t in&s;idious and dangerous hand-bills that ever was &s;een, had been circulated at Norwich again&s;t the war, drawn up in an hypocritical tone of compa&s;&s;ion for the Poor. This Addre&s;s to the Populace of Norwich was to play in concert with an Addre&s;s to Mr. Fox; it was &s;igned by Mr. Gurney and the higher part of the French Fraternity in that town. In this paper Mr. Fox is applauded for his Conduct throughout the &s;e&s;&s;ion; and reque&s;ted, before the prorogation, to make a motion for an im|mediate Peace with France.</P>
<P N="26"><PB N="46" REF="116">
26. Mr. Fox did not revoke to this &s;uit: he readily and thankfully undertook the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned to him. Not content, however, with merely falling in with their wi&s;hes, he propo&s;ed a ta&s;k on his part to the Gentle|men of Norwich, which was, <HI>that they &s;hould move the people without doors to petition again&s;t the War.</HI> He &s;aid, that without &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, little good could be expected from any thing he might attempt within the walls of the Hou&s;e of Commons. In the mean time, to animate his Norwich friends in their en|deavours to be&s;iege Parliament, he &s;natched the fir&s;t opportunity to give notice of a motion, which he very &s;oon after made, namely, to addre&s;s the Crown to make Peace with France. The Addre&s;s was &s;o worded as to co-operate with the hand-bill in bringing for|ward matter calculated to inflame the manu|facturers throughout the kingdom.</P>
<P N="27">27. In &s;upport of his motion, he declaimed in the mo&s;t virulent &s;train, even beyond any of his former invectives, again&s;t every power with whom we were then, and are now, acting again&s;t France.

<P N="28">28. Mr. Fox could not be ignorant of the mi&s;taken ba&s;is upon which his motion was grounded. He was not ignorant, that, though the attempt of Dumourier on Hol|land (&s;o very near &s;ucceeding), and the na|vigation of the Scheld (a part of the &s;ame piece), were among the <HI>immediate</HI> cau&s;es, they were by no means the only cau&s;es alledged for Parliament's taking that offence at the proceedings of France, for which the Jacobins were &s;o prompt in declaring war upon this kingdom. Other full as weighty cau&s;es had been alledged: They were, 1. The general overbearing and de&s;perate am|bition
<PB N="48" REF="118">
of that Faction. 2. Their actual at|tacks on every nation in Europe. 3. Their u&s;urpation of territories in the empire with the governments of which they had no pre|tence of quarrel. 4. Their perpetual and irrevocable con&s;olidation with their own do|minions of every territory of the Nether|lands, of Germany, and of Italy, of which they got a temporary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. 5. The mi&s;chiefs attending the prevalence of their &s;y&s;tem, which would make the &s;ucce&s;s of their ambitious de&s;igns a new and peculiar &s;pecies of calamity in the world. 6. Their formal publick decrees; particularly tho&s;e of the 19th of November, and 15th and 25th of December. 7. Their notorious attempts to undermine the Con&s;titution of this coun|try. 8. Their public reception of deputa|tions of traitors for that direct purpo&s;e. 9. Their murder of their Sovereign, declared by mo&s;t of the members of the Convention, who &s;poke with their vote (without a di&s;|avowal from any) to be perpetrated, as an example to <HI>all</HI> Kings, and a precedent for <HI>all</HI> &s;ubjects to follow. All the&s;e, and not the Scheld alone, or the inva&s;ion of Holland, were urged by the Mini&s;ter, and by Mr.
<PB N="49" REF="119">
Windham, by my&s;elf, and by others who &s;poke in tho&s;e debates, as cau&s;es for bring|ing France to a &s;en&s;e of her wrong in the war which &s;he declared again&s;t us. Mr. Fox well knew, that not one man argued for the nece&s;&s;ity of a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance to France, who did not &s;tate the war as being for the very exi&s;tence of the &s;ocial order here, and every part of Europe; who did not &s;tate his opinion, that this war was not at all a foreign War of Empire, but as much for our Liberties, Properties, Laws, and Religion; and even more &s;o than any we had ever been engaged in. This was the war, which, according to Mr. Fox and Mr. Gurney, we were to abandon before the enemy had felt, in the &s;lighte&s;t degree, the impre&s;&s;ion of our arms.</P>
<P N="29">29. Had Mr. Fox's di&s;graceful propo&s;al been complied with, this kingdom would have been &s;tained with a blot of perfidy hi|therto without an example in our hi&s;tory, and with far le&s;s excu&s;e than any act of per|fidy which we find in the hi&s;tory of any other nation. The moment, when by the incredible exertions of Au&s;tria (very little
<PB N="50" REF="120">
through our's) the temporary deliverance of Holland (in effect our own deliverance) had been atchieved, he advi&s;ed the Hou&s;e in|&s;tantly to abandon her to that very enemy, from who&s;e arms &s;he had freed our&s;elves, and the clo&s;e&s;t of our allies.</P>
<P N="30">30. But we are not to be impo&s;ed on by forms of language. We mu&s;t act on the &s;ub|&s;tance of Things. To abandon Au&s;tria in this manner, was to abandon Holland it&s;elf. For &s;uppo&s;e France, encouraged and &s;trengthened as &s;he mu&s;t have been by our treacherous de|&s;ertion, &s;uppo&s;e France, I &s;ay, to &s;ucceed again&s;t Au&s;tria, (as &s;he had &s;ucceeded the very year before) England would, after its di&s;|armament, have nothing in the world but the inviolable faith of Jacobini&s;m, and the &s;teady politics of anarchy to depend upon, again&s;t France's renewing the very &s;ame attempts upon Holland, and renewing them (con&s;ider|ing what Holland was and is) with much bet|ter pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s. Mr. Fox mu&s;t have been well aware, that if we were to break with the greater Continental Powers, and par|ticularly to come to a rupture with them, in the violent and intemperate mode in which
<PB N="51" REF="121">
he would have made the breach, the defence of Holland again&s;t a foreign enemy, and a &s;trong dome&s;tick faction, mu&s;t hereafter re&s;t &s;olely upon England, without the chance of a &s;ingle Ally, either on that or on any other occa&s;ion. So far as to the pretended &s;ole ob|ject of the war, which Mr. Fox &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o completely obtained, (but which then was not at all, and at this day is not com|pletely obtained,) as to leave us nothing el&s;e to do than to cultivate a peaceful, quiet cor|re&s;pondence with tho&s;e quiet, peaceable and moderate people, the Jacobins of France.</P>
<P N="31">31. To induce us to this, Mr. Fox labour|ed hard to make it appear, that the powers with whom we acted, were full as ambitious and as perfidious as the French. This might be true as to <HI>other</HI> nations. They had not, however, been &s;o to <HI>Us</HI> or to Holland. He produced no proof of active ambition and ill faith again&s;t Au&s;tria. But &s;uppo&s;ing the com|bined Powers had been all thus faithle&s;s, and had been all alike &s;o, there was one circum|&s;tance which made an e&s;&s;ential difference be|tween them and France. I need not therefore be at the trouble of conte&s;ting this point, which,
<PB N="52" REF="122">
however, in this latitude, and as at all affecting Great Britain and Holland, I deny utterly: Be it &s;o. But the great Monarchies have it in their power to keep their faith <HI>if they plea&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e they are Governments of e&s;tabli&s;hed and recognized authority at home and abroad. France had, in reality, no Government. The very factions who exerci&s;ed power, had no &s;tability. The French Convention had no powers of peace or war. Suppo&s;ing the Con|vention to be free (mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly it was not) they had &s;hewn no di&s;po&s;ition to abandon their projects. Though long driven out of Liege, it was not many days before Mr. Fox's mo|tion, that they &s;till continued to claim it as a country, which their principles of fraternity bound them to protect, that is, to &s;ubdue and to regulate at their plea&s;ure. That party which Mr. Fox inclined mo&s;t to favour and tru&s;t, and from which he mu&s;t have received his a&s;&s;urances (if any he did receive) that is, the <HI>Bri&s;&s;otins,</HI> were then either pri&s;oners or fugitives. The Party which prevailed over them (that of Danton and Marat) was it&s;elf in a tottering condition, and was di&s;owned by a very great part of France. To &s;ay nothing of the Royal Party who were powerful and
<PB N="53" REF="123">
growing, and who had full as good a right to claim to be the legitimate Government as any of the Pari&s;ian Factions with whom he pro|po&s;ed to treat&mdash;or rather (as it &s;eemed to me) to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P N="32">32. But when Mr. Fox began to come from his general hopes of the moderation of the Jacobins, to particulars, he put the ca&s;e, that they might not perhaps be willing to &s;urren|der Savoy. He certainly was not willing to conte&s;t that point with them; but plainly and explicitly (as I under&s;tood him) propo&s;ed to let them keep it; though he knew (or he was much wor&s;e informed than he would be thought) that England had, at the very time, agreed on the terms of a Treaty with the King of Sardinia, of which the recovery of Savoy was the <HI>Ca&s;us Federis.</HI> In the teeth of this Treaty, Mr. Fox propo&s;ed a direct and mo&s;t &s;candalous breach of our faith, for|mally and recently given. But to &s;urrender Savoy, was to &s;urrender a great deal more than &s;o many &s;quare acres of land, or &s;o much revenue. In its con&s;equences, the &s;urrender of Savoy, was to make a &s;urrender to France of Switzerland and Italy, of both which
<PB N="54" REF="124">
countries, Savoy is the key&mdash;as it is known to ordinary &s;peculators in politicks, though it may not be known to the Weavers in Nor|wich, who, it &s;eems are, by Mr. Fox, called to be the judges in this matter.</P>
<P N="33">33. A &s;ure way indeed, to encourage France not to make a &s;urrender of this key of Italy and Switzerland, or of Mayence, the key of Germany, or of any other object what&s;oever which &s;he holds, is to let her &s;ee, <HI>that the People of England rai&s;e a clamour again&s;t the War before terms are &s;o much as propo&s;ed on any &s;ide.</HI> From that moment, the Jacobins would be ma&s;ters of the terms.&mdash;They would know, that Parliament, at all hazards, would force the King to a &s;eparate Peace. The Crown could not, in that ca&s;e, have any u&s;e of its judgment. Parliament could not po&s;&s;e&s;s more judgment than the Crown, when be&s;ieged (as Mr. Fox propo&s;ed to Mr. Gurney) by the cries of the Manufac|turers. This de&s;cription of men, Mr. Fox endeavoured in his &s;peech, by every method, to irritate and inflame. In effect, his two &s;peeches were, through the whole, nothing more than an amplification of the Norwich
<PB N="55" REF="125">
Hand-bill. He re&s;ted the greate&s;t part of his argument on the di&s;tre&s;s of Trade, which he attributed to the war; though it was obvious, to any tolerably good ob&s;ervation, and much more mu&s;t have been clear to &s;uch an ob&s;er|vation as his, that the then difficulties of the Trade and Manufacture could have no &s;ort of connection with our &s;hare in it. The war had hardly begun. We had &s;uffered neither by &s;poil, nor by defeat, nor by di&s;grace of any kind. Public credit was &s;o little impaired, that in&s;tead of being &s;upported by any extra|ordinary aids from individuals, it advanced a credit to individuals to the amount of five millions, for the &s;upport of Trade and Manu|factures, under their temporary difficulties, a thing before never heard of;&mdash;a thing of which I do not commend the policy&mdash;but only &s;tate it, to &s;hew, that Mr. Fox's ideas of the effects of war were without any trace of foun|dation.</P>
<P N="33">33. It is impo&s;&s;ible not to correct the ar|guments and proceedings of a Party with that of its leader&mdash;e&s;pecially when not di&s;avowed or controlled by him. Mr. Fox's partizans declaim again&s;t all the powers of Europe, ex|cept
<PB N="56" REF="126">
the Jacobins, ju&s;t as he does; but not having the &s;ame rea&s;ons for management and caution which he has, they &s;peak out. He &s;atisfies him&s;elf merely with making his in|vectives, and leaves others to draw the con|clu&s;ion. But they produce their Poli&s;h inter|po&s;ition, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of leading to a French alliance. They urge their French Peace, in order to make a junction with the Jacobins to oppo&s;e the powers, whom, in their language, they call De&s;pots, and their leagues, a combination of De&s;pots. Indeed, no man can look on the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of Europe with the lea&s;t degree of di&s;cernment, who will not be thoroughly convinced, that England mu&s;t be the fa&s;t friend or the determined enemy of France. There is no medium; and I do not think Mr. Fox to be &s;o dull as not to ob&s;erve this. His Peace would have involved us in&s;tantly in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and mo&s;t ruinous wars; at the &s;ame time that it would have made a broad highway (acro&s;s which no human wi&s;dom could put an effectual barrier) for a mutual intercour&s;e with the fraternizing Jacobins on both &s;ides. The con&s;equences of which, tho&s;e will certainly not provide again&s;t, who do not dread or di&s;like them.</P>
<P N="34"><PB N="57" REF="127">
34. It is not ami&s;s in this place to enter a little more fully into the &s;pirit of the principal arguments on which Mr. Fox thought proper to re&s;t this his grand and concluding motion, particularly &s;uch as were drawn from the in|ternal &s;tate of our affairs. Under a &s;pecious appearance (not uncommonly put on by men of un&s;crupulous ambition) that of tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion to the Poor; he did his be&s;t to appeal to the judgments of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t ignorant of the people on the merits of the War. He had before done &s;omething of the &s;ame dangerous kind in his printed Letter. The ground of a political War is of all things that which the poor labourer and manufacturer are the lea&s;t capable of conceiving. This &s;ort of people know in general that they mu&s;t &s;uffer by War. It is a matter to which they are &s;ufficiently competent, becau&s;e it is a matter of feeling. The <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of a war are not matters of feeling, but of rea&s;on and fore&s;ight, and often of remote con&s;iderations, and of a very great combination of circum&s;tances, which <HI>they</HI> are utterly incapable of comprehending; and, indeed, it is not every man in the highe&s;t cla&s;&s;es who is altogether equal to it. Nothing, in a general &s;en&s;e, appears to me le&s;s fair and
<PB N="58" REF="128">
ju&s;tifiable, (even if no attempt were made to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions) than to &s;ubmit a matter on di&s;cu&s;&s;ion to a Tribunal incapable of judg|ing of more than <HI>one &s;ide</HI> of the que&s;tion. It is at lea&s;t as unju&s;tifiable to inflame the pa&s;|&s;ions of &s;uch Judges again&s;t <HI>that &s;ide,</HI> in favor of which they cannot &s;o much as comprehend the arguments. Before the prevalence of the French Sy&s;tem (which as far as it has gone has extingui&s;hed the &s;alutary prejudice called our Country) nobody was more &s;en&s;ible of this important truth than Mr. Fox; and nothing was more proper and pertinent, or was more felt at the time, than his reprimand to Mr. Wilberforce for an incon&s;iderate expre&s;&s;ion which tended to call in the judgment of the poor, to e&s;timate the policy of war upon the &s;tandard of the taxes they may be obliged to pay towards its &s;upport.</P>
<P N="35">35. It is fatally known, that the great Ob|ject of the Jacobin Sy&s;tem is to excite the lowe&s;t de&s;cription of the People to range them&s;elves under ambitious men, for the pil|lage and de&s;truction of the more eminent orders and cla&s;&s;es of the community. The thing, therefore, that a man not fanatically at|tached
<PB N="59" REF="129">
to that dreadful project, would mo&s;t &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid, is, to act a part with the French <HI>Propagandi&s;ts,</HI> in attributing (as they con&s;tantly do) all Wars and all the con&s;e|quences of Wars, to the pride of tho&s;e orders, and to their contempt of the weak and indi|gent part of the &s;ociety. The ruling Jaco|bins in&s;i&s;t upon it, that even the Wars which they carry on with &s;o much ob&s;tinacy again&s;t all Nations, are made to prevent the Poor from any longer being the in&s;truments and victims of Kings, Nobles, and the Ari&s;to|cracy of Burghers and Rich Men. They pre|tend that the de&s;truction of Kings, Nobles, and the Ari&s;tocracy of Burghers and Rich Men, is the only means of e&s;tabli&s;hing an univer&s;al and perpetual Peace. This is the great drift of all their writings from the time of the meeting of the States of France, in 1789, to the publication of the la&s;t Morning Chro|nicle. They in&s;i&s;t that even the War which, with &s;o much boldne&s;s, they have declared again&s;t all Nations, is to prevent the poor from becoming the In&s;truments and Victims of the&s;e per&s;ons and de&s;criptions. It is but too ea&s;y, if you once teach poor labourers and mechanics to de&s;y their prejudices, and as this
<PB N="60" REF="130">
has been done with an indu&s;try &s;carcely cre|dible, to &s;ub&s;titute the principles of frater|nity in the room of that &s;alutary prejudice called our Country; it is, I &s;ay, but too ea&s;y to pur&s;uade them agreeably to what Mr. Fox hints in his public Letter, that this War is, and that the other Wars have been, the Wars of Kings; it is ea&s;y to per&s;uade them that the terrors even of a foreign conque&s;t are not terrors for <HI>them</HI>&mdash;It is ea&s;y to per&s;uade them that, for their part, <HI>they</HI> have nothing to lo&s;e; and that their condition is not likely to be altered for the wor&s;e, whatever party may happen to prevail in the War. Under any circum&s;tances this doctrine is highly danger|ous, as it tends to make &s;eparate parties of the higher and lower orders, and to put their intere&s;ts on a different bottom. But if the enemy you have to deal with &s;hould appear, as France now appears, under the very name and title of the deliverer of the poor, and the cha&s;ti&s;er of the rich, the former cla&s;s would readily become, not an indifferent &s;pectator of the War, but would be ready to enli&s;t in the faction of the enemy; which they would con&s;ider, though under a foreign name, to be more connected with them than an adver&s;e
<PB N="61" REF="131">
de&s;cription in the &s;ame land. All the props of Society would be drawn from us by the&s;e doctrines, and the very foundations of the publick defence would give way in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P N="36">36. There is no point which the Faction of Fraternity in England have laboured more than to excite in the Poor the horror of any War with France upon any occa&s;ion. When they found that their open attacks upon our Con&s;titution in favor of a French Republick were for the pre&s;ent repelled&mdash;they put that matter out of &s;ight, and have taken up the more plau&s;ible and popular ground of general peace, upon merely general principles, al|though the&s;e very men, in the corre&s;pondence of their clubs with tho&s;e of France, had re|probated the neutrality which now they &s;o earne&s;tly pre&s;s. But, in reality, their maxim was and is <Q REND="inline">"Peace and Alliance with France, and War with the re&s;t of the World."</Q></P>
<P N="37">37. This la&s;t motion of Mr. Fox bound up the whole of his politics during the &s;e&s;&s;ion. This motion had many circum&s;tances, parti|cularly in the Norwich Corre&s;pondence, by which the mi&s;chief of all the others, was ag|gravated
<PB N="62" REF="132">
beyond mea&s;ure. Yet, this la&s;t mo|tion, far the wor&s;t of Mr. Fox's proceedings, was the be&s;t &s;upported of any of them, except his amendment to the Addre&s;s. The Duke of Portland had directly engaged to &s;upport the War&mdash;Here was a motion as directly made to force the Crown to put an end to it before a blow had been &s;truck. The efforts of the Faction have &s;o prevailed that &s;ome of his Grace's neare&s;t friends have actually voted for that motion: &s;ome, after &s;hewing them&s;elves, went away, others did not appear at all. So it mu&s;t be where a man is for any time &s;up|ported from per&s;onal con&s;iderations, without reference to his public conduct. Through the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s, the &s;pirit of fra|ternity appears to me to have been the go|verning principle. It might be &s;hameful for any man, above the vulgar, to &s;hew &s;o blind a partiality even to his own Country, as Mr. Fox appears, on all occa&s;ions, this Se&s;&s;ion, to have &s;hewn to France. Had Mr. Fox been a Mini&s;ter, and proceeded on the principles laid down by him, I believe there is little doubt he would have been con&s;idered as the mo&s;t criminal State&s;man that ever lived in this Country. I do not know why a State&s;|man
<PB N="63" REF="133">
out of place is not to be judged in the &s;ame manner, unle&s;s we can excu&s;e him by pleading in his favor a total indifference to principle; and that he would act and think in quite a different way if he were in office. This I will not &s;uppo&s;e. One may think better of him; and that in ca&s;e of his power he might change his mind. But &s;uppo&s;ing, that from better or from wor&s;e motives, he might change his mind on his acqui&s;ition of the favor of the Crown, I &s;eriou&s;ly fear that if the King &s;hould to-morrow put power into his hands, and that his good genius would in|&s;pire him with maxims very different from tho&s;e he has promulgated, he would not be able to get the better of the ill temper, and the ill doctrines he has been the means of ex|citing and propagating throughout the king|dom. From the very beginning of their inhu|man and unprovoked rebellion and tyrannick u&s;urpation, he has covered the predominant Faction in France, and their adherents here, with the mo&s;t exaggerated panegyricks; neither has he mi&s;&s;ed a &s;ingle opportunity of abu&s;ing and vilifying tho&s;e, who in uniform concur|rence with the Duke of Portland's and Lord Fitzwilliam's opinion, have maintained the
<PB N="64" REF="134">
true grounds of the Revolution Settlement in 1688. He lamented all the defeats of the French; he rejoiced in all their victories; even when the&s;e victories threatened to over|whelm the Continent of Europe, and by faci|litating their means of penetrating into Hol|land, to bring this mo&s;t dreadful of all evils with irre&s;i&s;tible force to the very doors, if not into the very heart, of our Country. To this hour he always &s;peaks of every thought of overturning the French Jacobini&s;m by force, on the part of any Power what&s;oever, as an attempt unju&s;t and cruel, and which he re|probates with horror. If any of the French Jacobin leaders are &s;poken of with hatred or &s;corn, he falls upon tho&s;e who take that li|berty, with all the zeal and warmth with which men of honour defend their particular and bo|&s;om friends, when attacked. He always re|pre&s;ents their cau&s;e as a cau&s;e of Liberty; and all who oppo&s;e it as partizans of de&s;poti&s;m. He ob&s;tinately continues to con&s;ider the great and growing vices, crimes and di&s;orders of that country, as only evils of pa&s;&s;age, which are to produce a permanently happy &s;tate of order and freedom. He repre&s;ents the&s;e di&s;|orders exactly in the &s;ame way, and with the
<PB N="65" REF="135">
&s;ame limitations which are u&s;ed by one of the two great Jacobin Factions, I mean that of PETION and BRISSOT. Like them he &s;tudiou&s;ly confines his horror and reprobation only to the ma&s;&s;acres of the &s;econd of September, and pa&s;&s;es by tho&s;e of the 10th of Augu&s;t, as well as the impri&s;onment and depo&s;ition of the King, which were the con&s;equences of that day, as indeed were the ma&s;&s;acres them&s;elves to which he confines his cen&s;ure, though they were not actually perpetrated till early in Sep|tember. Like that Faction, he condemns, not the depo&s;ition, or the propo&s;ed exile, or perpetual impri&s;onment, but only the murder of the King. Mr. Sheridan, on every occa|&s;ion, palliates all their ma&s;&s;acres committed in every part of France, as the effects of a natural indignation at the exorbitances of de&s;poti&s;m, and of the dread of the people of returning under that yoke&mdash;He has thus taken occa&s;ion to load, not the actors in this wicked|ne&s;s, but the Government of a mild, merciful, beneficent and patriotick Prince, and his &s;uf|fering, faithful &s;ubjects, with all the crimes of the new anarchical tyranny, under which the one has been murdered, and the others are oppre&s;&s;ed. Tho&s;e continual either praifes or
<PB N="66" REF="136">
palliating apologies of every thing done in France, and tho&s;e invectives as uniformly vo|mited out upon all tho&s;e who venture to ex|pre&s;s their di&s;approbation of &s;uch proceedings, coming from a man of Mr. Fox's fame and authority, and one who is con&s;idered as the per&s;on to whom a great party of the wealthie&s;t men of the Kingdom look up, have been the cau&s;e why the principle of French fraternity formerly gained the ground which at one time it had obtained in this Country. It will infallibly recover it&s;elf again, and in ten times a greater degree, if the kind of Peace, in the manner which he preaches, ever &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed with the reigning faction in France.</P>
<P N="38">038. So far as to the French practices with regard to France, and the other Powers of Eu|rope&mdash;as to their principles and doctrines, with regard to the Con&s;titution of States, Mr. Fox &s;tudiou&s;ly, on all occa&s;ions, and indeed when no occa&s;ion calls for it, (as on the Debate of the petition for Reform) brings forward and a&s;&s;erts their fundamental and fatal principle, pregnant with every mi&s;chief and every crime, namely, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in every Country the People is the legiti|mate Sovereign;"</Q> exactly conformable to the

Declaration of the French Clubs and Legi&s;lators,&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"La Souverainet&eacute; e&s;t <HI>une, indivi&s;ible, inalienable, et impre&s;criptible:</HI>&mdash;Elle appartient a la Na|tion:&mdash;Aucune <HI>Section</HI> du peuple, ni aucun <HI>Individu</HI> ne peut s'en attribuer l'exerci&s;e."</Q> This confounds, in a manner equally mi&s;chievous and &s;tupid, the origin of a Government from the people with its continuance in their hands. I believe, that no &s;uch doctrine has ever been heard of in any publick act of any Government what&s;oever, until it was adopted (I think from the writings of Rou&s;&s;eau) by the French A&s;&s;em|blies, who have made it the ba&s;is of their Con|&s;titution at home, and of the matter of their apo&s;tolate in every country. The&s;e, and other wild declarations of ab&s;tract principle, Mr. Fox &s;ays, are in them&s;elves perfectly right and true; though in &s;ome ca&s;es he allows the French draw ab&s;urd con&s;equences from them. But I con|ceive he is mi&s;taken. The con&s;equences are mo&s;t logically, though mo&s;t mi&s;chievou&s;ly drawn from the premi&s;es and principles by that wicked and ungracious faction. The fault is in the foundation.</P>
<P N="39">39. Before &s;ociety, in a multitude of men, it is obvious, that &s;overeignty and &s;ubjection are
<PB N="68" REF="138">
ideas which cannot exi&s;t. It is the compact on which &s;ociety is formed that makes both. But to &s;uppo&s;e the people, contrary to their com|pacts, both to give away and retain the &s;ame thing, is altogether ab&s;urd. It is wor&s;e, for it &s;uppo&s;es in any &s;trong combination of men a power and right of always di&s;&s;olving the &s;ocial union; which power, however, if it exi&s;ts, ren|ders them again as little &s;overeigns as &s;ubjects, but a mere unconnected multitude. It is not ea&s;y to &s;tate for what good end, at a time like this, when the foundations of all antient and pre&s;criptive Governments, &s;uch as ours (to which people &s;ubmit, not becau&s;e they have cho&s;en them, but becau&s;e they are born to them) are undermined by perilous theories, that Mr. Fox &s;hould be &s;o fond of referring to tho&s;e theories, upon all occa&s;ions, even though &s;peculatively they might be true, which God forbid they &s;hould! Particularly I do not &s;ee the rea&s;on why he &s;hould be &s;o fond of declaring, that the prin|ciples of the Revolution have made the Crown of Great Britain <HI>elective;</HI> why he thinks it &s;ea|&s;onable to preach up with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, for now three years together, the doctrine of re&s;i&s;tance and Revolution at all; or to a&s;&s;ert that our la&s;t Revolution of 1688 &s;tands on the

&s;ame or &s;imilar principles with that of France. We are not called upon to bring forward the&s;e doctrines, which are hardly ever re&s;orted to but in ca&s;es of extremity, and where they are fol|lowed by corre&s;pondent actions. We are not called upon by any circum&s;tance, that I know of, which can ju&s;tify a revolt, or which demands a Revolution, or can make an election of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the Crown nece&s;&s;ary, whatever la|tent right may be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t for effectu|ating any of the&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P N="40">40. Not the lea&s;t alarming of the proceedings of Mr. Fox and his friends in this Se&s;&s;ion, e&s;pe|cially taken in concurrence with their whole proceedings, with regard to France and its principles, is their eagerne&s;s at this Sea&s;on, un|der pretence of Parliamentary Reforms (a pro|ject which had been for &s;ome time rather dor|mant) to di&s;credit and di&s;grace the Hou&s;e of Commons. For this purpo&s;e the&s;e Gentlemen had found a way to in&s;ult the Hou&s;e by &s;everal atrocious libels in the form of petitions. In particular they brought up a libel, or rather a complete dige&s;t of libellous matter, from the Club called the Friends of the People. It is indeed at once the mo&s;t audacious and the mo&s;t
<PB N="70" REF="140">
in&s;idious of all the performances of that kind which have yet appeared. It is &s;aid to be the penman&s;hip of Mr. Tierney, to bring whom into Parliament the Duke of Portland formerly had taken a good deal of pains, and expended, as I hear, a con&s;iderable &s;um of money.</P>
<P N="41">41. Among the circum&s;tances of danger from that piece, and from its precedent, it is ob&s;ervable that this is the fir&s;t petition (if I re|member right) <HI>coming from a Club or A&s;&s;ociation, &s;igned by Individuals, denoting neither local re&s;i|dence, nor corporate capacity.</HI> This mode of pe|tition not being &s;trictly illegal or informal, though in its &s;pirit in the highe&s;t degree mi&s;|chievous, may and will lead to other things of that nature, tending to bring the&s;e Clubs and A&s;&s;ociations to the French model, and to make them in the end an&s;wer French purpo&s;es: I mean, that without legal names, the&s;e Clubs will be led to a&s;&s;ume political capacities; that they may debate the forms of Con&s;titution; and that from their Meetings they may in&s;olently dictate their will to the regular authorities of the Kingdom, in the manner in which the Jacobin Clubs i&s;&s;ue their mandates to the National A&s;|&s;embly, or the National Convention. The au|dacious
<PB N="71" REF="141">
remon&s;trance, I ob&s;erve, is &s;igned by all of that A&s;&s;ociation (the Friends of the Peo|ple) <HI>who are not in Parliament,</HI> and it was &s;up|ported mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly by all the A&s;&s;ociators <HI>who are Members,</HI> with Mr. Fox at their head. He and they contended for referring this libel to a committee. Upon the que&s;tion of that reference, they grounded all their debate for a change in the Con&s;titution of Parliament. The pretended Petition is, in fact, a regular charge or impeachment of the Hou&s;e of Commons, dige&s;ted into a number of Articles. This plan of reform is not a criminal Impeachment, but a matter of prudence, to be &s;ubmitted to the pub|lick wi&s;dom, which mu&s;t be as well appri&s;ed of the facts as petitioners can be. But tho&s;e accu|&s;ers of the Hou&s;e of Commons have proceeded upon the principles of a criminal proce&s;s; and have had the effrontery to offer proof on each Article.</P>
<P N="42">42. This charge, the party of Mr. Fox maintained article by article, beginning with the fir&s;t; namely, the interference of Peers at Elec|tions, and their nominating in effect &s;everal of the Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons. In the printed li&s;t of grievances which they made
<PB N="72" REF="142">
out on the occa&s;ion, and in &s;upport of their charge, is found the Borough, for which, under Lord Fitzwilliams' influence, I now &s;it. By this Remon&s;trance, and its object, they hope to defeat the operation of property in Elections, and in reality to di&s;&s;olve the connexion and communication of intere&s;ts which makes the Hou&s;es of Parliament a mutual &s;upport to each other. Mr. Fox and the Friends of the People are not &s;o ignorant as not to know, that Peers do not interfere in Elections as Peers, but as men of property&mdash;They well know that the Hou&s;e of Lords is by it&s;elf the feeble&s;t part of the Con&s;titution; they know that the Hou&s;e of Lords is &s;upported only by its connexions with the Crown, and with the Hou&s;e of Commons; and that without this double connexion the Lords could not exi&s;t a &s;ingle year. They know, that all the&s;e parts of our Con&s;titution, whil&s;t they are balanced as oppo&s;ing intere&s;ts, are al&s;o connected as friends; otherwi&s;e nothing but confu&s;ion could be the re&s;ult of &s;uch a com|plex Con&s;titution. It is natural, therefore, that they who wi&s;h the common de&s;truction of the whole, and of all its parts, &s;hould contend for their total &s;eparation. But as the Hou&s;e of Commons is that link which connects both the
<PB N="73" REF="143">
other parts of the Con&s;titution (the Crown and the Lords) <HI>with the Ma&s;s of the People,</HI> it is to that link (as it is natural enough) that their ince&s;&s;ant attacks are directed. That artificial repre&s;entation of the people being once di&s;credited and overturned, all goes to pieces, and nothing but a plain <HI>French</HI> democracy or arbitrary monarchy can po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t.</P>
<P N="43">43. Some of the&s;e gentlemen who have attacked the Hou&s;e of Commons, lean to a repre&s;entation of the people by the head, that is, to <HI>individual repre&s;entation.</HI> None of them that I recollect, except Mr. Fox, directly rejected it. It is remarkable, how|ever, that he only rejected it by &s;imply de|claring an opinion. He let all the argument go again&s;t his opinion. All the proceedings and arguments of his reforming friends lead to individual repre&s;entation and to nothing el&s;e. It de&s;erves to be attentively ob&s;erved, <HI>that this individual repre&s;entation is the only plan of their reform, which has been explicitly propo&s;ed.</HI> In the mean time, the conduct of Mr. Fox appears to be far more inexplicable, on any good ground, than theirs, who pro|po&s;e
<PB N="74" REF="144">
the individual repre&s;entation; for he neither propo&s;es any thing, nor even &s;ugge&s;ts that he has any thing to propo&s;e, in lieu of the pre&s;ent mode of con&s;tituting the Hou&s;e of Commons. On the contrary, he declares again&s;t all the plans which have yet been &s;ugge&s;ted, either from him&s;elf or others: yet, thus unprovided with any plan what&s;oever, he pre&s;&s;ed forward this unknown reform with all po&s;&s;ible warmth; and for that purpo&s;e, in a &s;peech of &s;everal hours, he urged the referring to a committee, the libellous im|peachment of the Hou&s;e of Commons by the a&s;&s;ociation of the Friends of the People. But for Mr. Fox to di&s;credit Parliament <HI>as it &s;tands,</HI> to countenance leagues, cove|nants, and a&s;&s;ociations for its further di&s;|credit, to render it perfectly odious and contemptible, and at the &s;ame time to pro|po&s;e nothing at all in place of what he di&s;|graces, is wor&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, than to contend for per&s;onal individual repre&s;entation, and is little le&s;s than demanding, in plain terms, to bring on plain anarchy.</P>
<P N="44">44. Mr. Fox and the&s;e gentlemen have, for the pre&s;ent, been defeated; but they are
<PB N="75" REF="145">
neither converted nor di&s;heartened. They have &s;olemnly declared, that they will per|&s;evere until they &s;hall have obtained their ends; per&s;i&s;ting to a&s;&s;ert, that the Hou&s;e of Com|mons not only is not the true repre&s;entative of the people, but that it does not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of &s;uch repre&s;entation; mo&s;t of them in&s;i&s;t that all the debts, the taxes, and the burthens of all kinds on the people, with every other evil and inconvenience, which we have &s;uffered &s;ince the Revolution, have been owing &s;olely to an Hou&s;e of Com|mons which does not &s;peak the &s;en&s;e of the people.</P>
<P N="45">45. It is al&s;o not to be forgotten, that Mr. Fox, and all who hold with him, on this, as on all other occa&s;ions of pretended Reform, mo&s;t bitterly reproach Mr. Pitt with treachery, in declining to &s;upport the &s;candalous charges and indefinite projects of this infamous libel from the Friends of the People. By the animo&s;ity with which they per&s;ecute all tho&s;e who grow cold in this cau&s;e of pretended Reform, they hope, that if through levity, inexperience, or ambi|tion, any young per&s;on (like Mr. Pitt, for
<PB N="76" REF="146">
in&s;tance) happens to be once embarked in their de&s;ign, they &s;hall, by a fal&s;e &s;hame, keep him fa&s;t in it for ever. Many they have &s;o hampered.</P>
<P N="46">46. I know it is u&s;ual, when the peril and alarm of the hour appears to be a little over|blown, to think no more of the matter. But for my part, I look back with horror on what we have e&s;caped; and am full of anxiety with regard to the dangers, which, in my opinion, are &s;till to be apprehended both at home and abroad. This bu&s;ine&s;s has ca&s;t deep roots. Whether it is nece&s;&s;arily con|nected in theory with Jacobini&s;m is not worth a di&s;pute: The two things are con|nected in fact. The partizans of the one are the partizans of the other. I know it is common with tho&s;e who are favourable to the Gentlemen of Mr. Fox's party, and to their leader, though not at all devoted to all their reforming projects, or their Gallican politics, to argue in palliation of their con|duct, that it is not in their power to do all the harm which their actions evidently tend to. It is &s;aid, that as the people will not &s;up|port them, they may &s;afely be indulged in
<PB N="77" REF="147">
tho&s;e eccentric fancies of Reform, and tho&s;e theories which lead to nothing. This apo|logy is not very much to the honour of tho&s;e politicians, who&s;e intere&s;ts are to be adhered to in defiance of their conduct. I cannot flat|ter my&s;elf that the&s;e ince&s;&s;ant attacks on the Con&s;titution of Parliament are &s;afe. It is not in my power to de&s;pi&s;e the uncea&s;ing ef|forts of a Confederacy of about fifty per|&s;ons of eminence; men, for the far greater part, of very ample fortunes either in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or in expectancy; men of decided characters and vehement pa&s;&s;ions, men of very great talents of all kinds; of much boldne&s;s, and of the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;pirit of artifice, intrigue, adventure, and enter|prize, all operating with unwearied activity and per&s;everance. The&s;e gentlemen, are much &s;tronger too without doors than &s;ome calculate. They have the more active part of the di&s;&s;enters with them; and the whole clan of &s;peculators of all denominations&mdash;a large and growing &s;pecies. They have that floating multitude which goes with events and which &s;uffers the lo&s;s or gain of a battle, to decide it's opinions of right and wrong. As long as by every art this party keeps
<PB N="78" REF="148">
alive a &s;pirit of di&s;affection again&s;t the very Con&s;titution of the kingdom, and attributes, as lately it has been in the habit of doing, all the public misfortunes to that Con&s;titution, it is ab&s;olutely <HI>impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> but that &s;ome mo|ment mu&s;t arrive, in which they will be enabled to produce a pretended Reform and a real Revolution. If ever the body of this <HI>compound Con&s;titution</HI> of ours is &s;ubverted either in favour of unlimited Monarchy, or of wild Democracy, that ruin will <HI>mo&s;t certainly</HI> be the re&s;ult of this very &s;ort of machinations again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Commons. It is not from a confidence in the views or intentions of any State&s;man, that I think he is to be indulged in the&s;e perilous amu&s;e|ments.</P>
<P N="47">47. Before it is made the great object of any man's political life to rai&s;e another to power, it is right to con&s;ider what are the real di&s;po&s;itions of the per&s;on to be &s;o elevated. We are not to form our judg|ment on the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions from the rules and principles of a court of Ju&s;tice, but from tho&s;e of private di&s;cretion; not looking for what would &s;erve to criminate another, but
<PB N="79" REF="149">
what is &s;ufficient to direct our&s;elves. By a compari&s;on of a &s;eries of the di&s;cour&s;es and actions of certain men, for a rea&s;onable length of time, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to obtain &s;ufficient indication of the general tendency of their views and principles. There is no other rational mode of proceeding. It is true, that in &s;ome one or two, perhaps not well-weighed expre&s;&s;ions, or &s;ome one or two unconnected and doubtful affairs, we may and ought to judge of the actions or words by our previous good or ill opinion of the man. But this allowance has its bounds. It does not extend to any regular cour&s;e of &s;y&s;tematick action, or of con&s;tant and repeated di&s;cour&s;e. It is again&s;t every principle of common &s;en&s;e and of ju&s;tice to one&s;elf, and to the public, to judge of a &s;eries of &s;peeches and actions from the man, and not of the man from the whole tenor of his language and conduct. I have &s;tated the above matters, not as inferring a cri|minal charge of evil intention. If I had meant to do &s;o, perhaps they are &s;tated with tolerable exactne&s;s&mdash;But I have no &s;uch view. The intentions of the&s;e Gentlemen may be very pure. I do not di&s;pute it.
<PB N="80" REF="150">
But I think they are in &s;ome great errour. If the&s;e things are done by Mr. Fox and his friends, with good intentions, they are not done le&s;s dangerou&s;ly; for it &s;hews the&s;e good intentions are not under the direction of &s;afe maxims and principles.</P>
<P N="48">48. Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, and the Gen|tlemen who call them&s;elves the phalanx, have not been &s;o very indulgent to others. They have thought proper to a&s;cribe to tho&s;e Mem|bers of the Hou&s;e of Commons, who, in ex|act agreement with the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam, abhor and oppo&s;e the French &s;y&s;tem, the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t unworthy motives for their conduct;&mdash;as if none could oppo&s;e that athei&s;tick, immoral, and impolitick project &s;et up in France, &s;o di&s;graceful and de&s;tructive, as I conceive, to human nature it&s;elf, but with &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter intentions. They treat tho&s;e Members on all occa&s;ions with a &s;ort of lordly in&s;olence, though they are per&s;ons that (whatever homage they may pay to the eloquence of the Gentlemen who chu&s;e to look down upon them with &s;corn), are not their inferiors in any particular which calls for and obtains ju&s;t con&s;ideration from the
<PB N="81" REF="151">
public; not their inferiors in knowledge of public law, or of the Con&s;titution of the king|dom; not their inferiors in their acquaintance with its foreign and dome&s;tic intere&s;ts; not their inferiors in experience or practice of bu|&s;ine&s;s; not their inferiors in moral character; not their inferiors in the proofs they have given of zeal and indu&s;try in the &s;ervice of their country. Without denying to the&s;e Gentlemen, the re&s;pect and con&s;ideration which, it is allowed, ju&s;tly belongs to them, we &s;ee no rea&s;on why they &s;hould not as well be obliged to defer &s;omething to our opinions, as that we &s;hould be bound blindly and &s;er|vilely to follow tho&s;e of Mr. Fox, Mr. She|ridan, Mr. Grey, Mr. Courtney, Mr. Lamb|ton, Mr. Whitbread, Mr. Francis, Mr. Tay|lor, and others. We are Members of Parlia|ment and their equals. We never con&s;ider our&s;elves as their followers. The&s;e Gentle|men (&s;ome of them hardly born, when &s;ome of us came into Parliament) have thought proper to treat us as de&s;erters, as if we had been li&s;ted into their phalanx like &s;oldiers, and had &s;worn to live and die in their French principles. This in&s;olent claim of &s;uperiority on their part, and of a &s;ort of va&s;&s;alage to them
<PB N="82" REF="152">
on that of other Members, is what no liberal mind will &s;ubmit to bear.</P>
<P N="49">49. The Society of the Liberty of the Pre&s;s, the Whig Club, and the Society for Con&s;ti|tutional Information, and (I believe) the Friends of the People, as well as &s;ome Clubs in Scotland, have indeed declared, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That their confidence in and attachment to Mr. Fox, has lately been confirmed, &s;trength|ened, and encrea&s;ed by the calumnies (as they are called) again&s;t him."</Q> It is true, Mr. Fox and his friends have tho&s;e te&s;timonies in their favour, again&s;t certain old friends of the Duke of Portland. Yet on a full, &s;erious, and I think di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate con&s;ideration of the whole of what Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan and their friends have acted, &s;aid and written, in this Se&s;&s;ion, in&s;tead of doing any thing which might tend to procure power, or any &s;hare of it what&s;oever, to them or to their phalanx (as they call it) or to encrea&s;e their credit, influence, or popularity in the nation, I think it one of my mo&s;t &s;erious and impor|tant public duties, in what&s;oever &s;tation I may be placed for the &s;hort time I have to live, effectually to employ my be&s;t endeavours, by
<PB N="83" REF="153">
every prudent and every lawful means, to traver&s;e all their de&s;igns. I have only to la|ment, that my abilities are not greater, and that my probability of life is not better, for the more effectual pur&s;uit of that object. But I tru&s;t that neither the principles nor exertions will die with me. I am the rather confirmed in this my re&s;olution, and in this my wi&s;h of tran&s;mitting it, becau&s;e every ray of hope concerning a po&s;&s;ible controul or mitigation of the enormous mi&s;chiefs which the principles of the&s;e Gentlemen, and which their con|nexions full as dangerous as their principles, might receive from the influence of the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam, on be|coming their colleagues in office, is now en|tirely bani&s;hed from the mind of every one living.&mdash;It is apparent, even to the world at large, that &s;o far from having a power to di|rect or to guide Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Grey, and the re&s;t, in any important matter, they have not, through this Se&s;&s;ion, been able to prevail on them to forbear or to delay, or mitigate, or &s;often any one act, or any one expre&s;&s;ion upon &s;ubjects on which they e&s;&s;en|tially differed.</P>
<P N="50"><PB N="84" REF="154">
50. Even if this hope of a po&s;&s;ible con|troul did exi&s;t, yet the declared opinions and the uniform line of conduct conformable to tho&s;e opinions, pur&s;ued by Mr. Fox, mu&s;t become a matter of &s;erious alarm if he &s;hould obtain a power either at Court or in Parlia|ment, or in the nation at large; and for this plain rea&s;on&mdash;He mu&s;t be the mo&s;t active and efficient member in any Admini&s;tration of which he &s;hall form a part. That a man, or &s;et of men, are guided by &s;uch not dubious, but delivered and avowed principles and max|ims of policy as to need a watch and check on them, in the exerci&s;e of the highe&s;t power, ought, in my opinion, to make every man, who is not of the &s;ame principles, and guided by the &s;ame maxims, a little cautious how he makes him&s;elf one of the traver&s;es of a ladder, to help &s;uch a man or &s;uch a &s;et of men, to climb up to the highe&s;t authority. A mini&s;ter of this country is to be controulled by the Hou&s;e of Commons. He is to be tru&s;ted, not <HI>controulled,</HI> by his colleagues in of|fice; if he were to be controulled, Government, which ought to be the &s;ource of order, would it|&s;elf become a &s;cene of anarchy. Be&s;ides, Mr. Fox is a man of an a&s;piring and commanding
<PB N="85" REF="155">
mind, made rather to controul, than to be con|troulled, and he never will be, nor can be, in any Admini&s;tration, in which he will be guided by any of tho&s;e whom I have been accu&s;tomed to confide in. It is ab&s;urd to think that he would or could. If his own opinions do not controul him, nothing can. When we con&s;ider of an adherence to a man which leads to his power, we mu&s;t not only &s;ee what the man is, but how he &s;tands related. It is not to be forgotten that Mr. Fox acts in clo&s;e and in&s;eparable connection with another Gentleman of exactly the &s;ame de&s;cription as him&s;elf, and who, perhaps, of the two is the leader. The re&s;t of the body are not a great deal more tractable; and over them if Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan have authority, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly the Duke of Portland has not the &s;malle&s;t degree of in|fluence.</P>
<P N="51">51. One mu&s;t take care, that a blind par|tiality to &s;ome per&s;ons, and as blind an hatred to others, may not enter into our minds under a colour of inflexible publick principle. We hear, as a rea&s;on for cling|ing to Mr. Fox at pre&s;ent, that nine years
<PB N="86" REF="156">
ago Mr. Pitt got into power by mi&s;chievous intrigues with the Court, with the Di&s;&s;enters, and with other factious people out of Par|liament, to the di&s;credit and weakening of the power of the Hou&s;e of Commons. His conduct nine years ago I &s;till hold to be very culpable. There are, however, many things very culpable that I do not know how to puni&s;h. My opinion, on &s;uch matters, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the good of the &s;tate, as I have done on other occa&s;ions; and particu|larly with regard to the authors and ma|nagers of the American war, with whom I have acted, both in office and in oppo&s;ition, with great confidence and cordiality, though I thought many of their acts criminal and impeachable. Whil&s;t the mi&s;conduct of Mr. Pitt and his a&s;&s;ociates was yet recent, it was not po&s;&s;ible to get Mr. Fox of him|&s;elf to take a &s;ingle &s;tep, or even to counte|nance others in taking any &s;tep upon the ground of that mi&s;conduct and fal&s;e policy, though if the matters had been then taken up and pur&s;ued, &s;uch a &s;tep could not have ap|peared &s;o evidently de&s;perate as now it is.&mdash;So far from pur&s;uing Mr. Pitt, I know that then, and for &s;ome time after, &s;ome of Mr.

Fox's friends were actually, and with no &s;mall earne&s;tne&s;s, looking out to a coalition with that gentleman. For years I never heard this circum&s;tance of Mr. Pitt's mi&s;|conduct on that occa&s;ion mentioned by Mr. Fox, either in publick or in private, as a ground for oppo&s;ition to that mini&s;ter. All oppo&s;ition, from that period to this very Se&s;&s;ion, has proceeded upon the &s;eparate mea&s;ures as they &s;eparately aro&s;e, without any vindictive retro&s;pect to Mr. Pitt's con|duct in 1784. My memory, however, may fail me. I mu&s;t appeal to the printed de|bates, which, (&s;o far as Mr. Fox is concerned) are unu&s;ually accurate.</P>
<P N="52">52. Whatever might have been in our power, at an early period, at this day I &s;ee no remedy for what was done in 1784. I had no great hopes even at the time. I was therefore very eager to record a remon&s;trance on the journals of the Hou&s;e of Commons, as a caution again&s;t &s;uch a popular delu&s;ion in times to come; and this I then feared, and now am certain, is all that could be done. I know of no way of animadverting on the Crown. I know of no mode of calling
<PB N="88" REF="158">
to account the Hou&s;e of Lords, who threw out the India Bill, in a way not much to their credit. As little, or rather le&s;s, am I able to coerce the people at large, who be|haved very unwi&s;ely and intemperately on that occa&s;ion. Mr. Pitt was then accu&s;ed, by me as well as others, of attempting to be Mini&s;ter, without enjoying the confi|dence of the Hou&s;e of Commons, though he did enjoy the confidence of the Crown. That Hou&s;e of Commons, who&s;e confidence he did not enjoy, unfortunately did not it|&s;elf enjoy the confidence, (though we well de&s;erved it) either of the Crown or of the public. For want of that confidence, the then Hou&s;e of Commons did not &s;urvive the conte&s;t. Since that period Mr. Pitt has en|joyed the confidence of the Crown, and of the Lords, and <HI>of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> through two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Parliaments; and I &s;u&s;pect that he has ever &s;ince, and that he does &s;till, enjoy as large a portion, at lea&s;t, of the confidence of the people without doors, as his great rival. Before whom, then, is Mr. Pitt to be impeached, and by whom? The more I con&s;ider the matter, the more firmly I am convinced, that the
<PB N="89" REF="159">
idea of pro&s;cribing Mr. Pitt <HI>indirectly,</HI> when you cannot <HI>directly puni&s;h</HI> him, is as chime|rical a project, and as unju&s;tifiable, as it would be to have pro&s;cribed Lord North. For &s;uppo&s;ing, that by indirect ways of op|po&s;ition, by oppo&s;ition upon mea&s;ures which do not relate to the bu&s;ine&s;s of 1784, but which on other grounds might prove unpo|pular, you were to drive him from his &s;eat, this would be no example whatever of pu|ni&s;hment for the matters we charge as of|fences in 1784. On a cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ion|ate view of the affairs of this time and country, it appears obvious to me, that one or the other of tho&s;e two great men, that is, Mr. Pitt or Mr. Fox, mu&s;t be Mini&s;ter. They are, I am &s;orry for it, irreconcileable. Mr. Fox's conduct <HI>in this Se&s;&s;ion</HI> has rendered the idea of his power a matter of &s;erious alarm to many people, who were very little plea&s;ed with the proceedings of Mr. Pitt in the beginning of his admini&s;tration. They like neither the conduct of Mr. Pitt, in 1784, nor that of Mr. Fox, in 1793; but they e&s;timate, which of the evils is mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing at the time, and what is likely to be the con&s;equence of a change. If Mr. Fox
<PB N="90" REF="160">
be wedded, they mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that his opinions and principles, on the now exi&s;ting &s;tate of things at home and abroad, mu&s;t be taken as his portion. In his train mu&s;t al&s;o be taken the whole body of gentlemen, who are pledged to him and to each other, and to their common politicks and principles.&mdash;I believe no King of Great Britain ever will adopt for his confidential &s;ervants, that body of gentlemen, holding that body of principles. Even if the pre&s;ent King or his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould think fit to take that &s;tep, I apprehend a general di&s;content of tho&s;e, who wi&s;h that this nation and that Europe &s;hould continue in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, would en&s;ue; a di&s;content, which, combined with the principles and progre&s;s of the new men in power, would &s;hake this kingdom to its foundations. I do not believe any one po|litical conjecture can be more certain than this.</P>
<P N="53">53. Without at all defending or palliating Mr. Pitt's conduct in 1784, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the cri&s;is of 1793, with regard to every thing at home and abroad, is full as im|portant as that of 1784 ever was; and, if
<PB N="91" REF="161">
for no other rea&s;on, by being pre&s;ent is much more important. It is not to nine years ago we are to look for the danger of Mr. Fox's and Mr. Sheridan's conduct, and that of the Gentlemen who act with them. It is at <HI>this</HI> very time, and in <HI>this</HI> very &s;e&s;&s;ion, that, if they had not been &s;trenuou&s;ly re|&s;i&s;ted, they would not only merely have di&s;|credited the Hou&s;e of Commons (as Mr. Pitt did in 1784, when he per&s;uaded the King to reject their advice, and to appeal from them to the people), but, in my opi|nion, would have been the means of wholly &s;ubverting the Hou&s;e of Commons and the Hou&s;e of Peers, and the whole Con&s;titution actual and virtual, together with the &s;afety and independence of this nation, and the peace and &s;ettlement of every State in the now Chri&s;tian world. It is to our opinion of the nature of Jacobini&s;m, and of the probability by corruption, faction, and force, of its gaining ground every where, that the que&s;tion whom and what you are to &s;upport is to be determined. For my part, without doubt or he&s;itation, I look upon Jacobini&s;m, as the mo&s;t dreadful, and the mo&s;t &s;hame|ful evil, which ever afflicted mankind, a
<PB N="92" REF="162">
thing which goes beyond the power of all calculation in its mi&s;chief; and that if it is &s;uffered to exi&s;t in France, we mu&s;t in England, and &s;peedily too, fall into that calamity.</P>
<P N="54">54. I figure to my&s;elf the purpo&s;e of the&s;e Gentlemen accompli&s;hed, and this Mini&s;try de&s;troyed. I &s;ee that the per&s;ons who in that ca&s;e mu&s;t rule, can be no other than Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Grey, the Marquis of Lan&s;|downe, Lord Thurlow, Lord Lauderdale, and the Duke of Norfolk, with the other Chiefs of the Friends of the People, the Parliamentary Reformers, and the Admirers of the French Revolution. The principal of the&s;e are all formally pledged to their projects. If the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam &s;hould be admitted into that &s;y&s;tem (as they might and probably would be), it is quite certain they could not have the &s;malle&s;t weight in it; le&s;s, indeed, than what they now po&s;&s;e&s;s, if le&s;s were po&s;&s;ible: becau&s;e they would be le&s;s wanted than they now are; and becau&s;e all tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to join them, and to act under them, have been rejected by the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam them&s;elves;
<PB N="93" REF="163">
and Mr. Fox, finding them thus by them|&s;elves di&s;armed, has built quite a new fabric, upon quite a new foundation. There is no trifling on this &s;ubject. We &s;ee very di&s;tinctly before us the Mini&s;try that would be formed, and the plan that would be pur&s;ued. If we like the plan, we mu&s;t wi&s;h the power of tho&s;e who are to carry it into execution; but to pur&s;ue the political exaltation of tho&s;e who&s;e political mea&s;ures we di&s;approve, and who&s;e principles we di&s;&s;ent from, is a &s;pecies of modern politicks not ea&s;ily comprehen&s;ible, and which mu&s;t end in the ruin of the coun|try, if it &s;hould continue and &s;pread. Mr. Pitt may be the wor&s;t of men, and Mr. Fox may be the be&s;t; but, at pre&s;ent, the former is in the intere&s;t of his country, and of the order of things long e&s;tabli&s;hed in Europe: Mr. Fox is not. I have, for one, been born in this order of things, and would fain die in it. I am &s;ure it is &s;ufficient to make men as virtuous, as happy, and as knowing as any thing which Mr. Fox, and his friends abroad or at home, would &s;ub&s;titute in its place; and I &s;hould be &s;orry that any &s;et of politicians &s;hould obtain power in England, who&s;e principles or &s;chemes &s;hould lead them to countenance per|&s;ons
<PB N="94" REF="164">
or factions who&s;e object is to introduce &s;ome new devi&s;ed order of things into England, or to &s;upport that order where it is already introduced, in France; a place, in which if it can be fixed, in my mind, it mu&s;t have a certain and decided influence in and upon this kingdom. This is my account of my con|duct to my private friends. I have already &s;aid all I wi&s;h to &s;ay, or nearly &s;o, to the publick. I write this with pain, and with an heart full of grief!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER TO ******* *******, ESQUIRE. OCCASIONED BY THE ACCOUNT GIVEN IN A NEWSPAPER OF THE SPEECH MADE IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS, BY THE **** OF ******* IN THE DEBATE CONCERNING LORD FITZWILLIAM, 1795.</HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB REF="166">
<HEAD>LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Beaconsfield,</HI> <DATE><HI>May</HI> 26, 1795.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been told of the voluntary, which, for the entertainment of the Hou&s;e of Lords, has been lately played by His Grace the **** of *******, a great deal at my expence, and a little at his own. I confe&s;s I &s;hould have liked the compo&s;ition rather better, if it had been quite new. But every man has his ta&s;te, and His Grace is an admirer of antient mu&s;ick.</P>
<P>There may be &s;ometimes too much even of a good thing. A toa&s;t is good, and a bumper is not bad: but the be&s;t toa&s;ts may be &s;o often repeated as to di&s;gu&s;t the palate, and cea&s;ele&s;s rounds of bumpers may nau&s;eate and overload the &s;tomach. The ears of the mo&s;t &s;teady-vo|ting politicians may at la&s;t be &s;tunned with three times three. I am &s;ure I have been very grateful for the flattering remembrance made of me in the toa&s;ts of the Revolution Society, and of other clubs formed on the &s;ame laudable plan. After giving the brim|ming
<PB N="98" REF="167">
honours to Citizen Thomas Paine, and to Citizen Dr. Prie&s;tley, the gentlemen of the&s;e clubs &s;eldom failed to bring me forth in my turn, and to drink, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. Burke, and thanks to him for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion he has pro|voked."</Q></P>
<P>I found my&s;elf elevated with this honour; for even by the colli&s;ion of re&s;i&s;tance, to be the means of &s;triking out &s;parkles of truth, if not merit, is at lea&s;t felicity.</P>
<P>Here I might have re&s;ted. But when I found that the great advocate, Mr. Er&s;kine, conde&s;cended to re&s;ort to the&s;e bumper toa&s;ts, as the pure and exuberant fountains of poli|ticks and of rhetorick, (as I hear he did, in three or four &s;peeches made in defence of cer|tain worthy citizens) I was rather let down a little. Though &s;till &s;omewhat proud of my|&s;elf, I was not quite &s;o proud of my voucher. Though he is no idolater of fame, in &s;ome way or other, Mr. Er&s;kine will always do him|&s;elf honour. Methinks, however, in follow|ing the precedents of the&s;e toa&s;ts, he &s;eemed to do more credit to his diligence, as a &s;pecial pleader, than to his invention as an orator.
<PB N="99" REF="168">
To tho&s;e who did not know the abundance of his re&s;ources, both of genius and erudition, there was &s;omething in it that indicated the want of a good a&s;&s;ortment, with regard to rich|ne&s;s and variety, in the magazine of topicks and common-places, which I &s;uppo&s;e he keeps by him, in imitation of Cicero and other re|nowned declaimers of antiquity.</P>
<P>Mr. Er&s;kine &s;upplied &s;omething, I allow, from the &s;tores of his imagination, in meta|morpho&s;ing the jovial toa&s;ts of clubs, into &s;o|lemn &s;pecial arguments at the bar. So far the thing &s;hewed talent: however I mu&s;t &s;till prefer the bar of the tavern to the other bar. The toa&s;ts at the fir&s;t hand were better than the arguments at the &s;econd. Even when the toa&s;ts began to grow old as &s;arca&s;ms, they were wa&s;hed down with &s;till older pricked election port; then the acid of the wine made &s;ome amends for the want of any thing piquant in the wit. But when His Grace gave them a &s;econd transformation, and brought out the vapid &s;tuff, which had wearied the clubs and di&s;gu&s;ted the courts; the drug made up of the bottoms of rejected bottles, all &s;melling &s;o woefully of the cork and of the ca&s;k, and of
<PB N="100" REF="169">
every thing except the hone&s;t old lamp, and when that &s;ad draught had been farther in|fected with the gaol pollution of the Old Bailey, and was da&s;hed and brewed, and in|effectually &s;tummed again into a &s;enatorial ex|ordium in the Hou&s;e of Lords, I found all the high flavour and mantling of my honours, ta&s;tele&s;s, flat, and &s;tale. Unluckily, the new tax on wine is felt even in the greate&s;t for|tunes, and His Grace &s;ubmits to take up with the heel-taps of Mr. Er&s;kine.</P>
<P>I have had the ill or good fortune to pro|voke two great men of this age to the publi|cation of their opinions; I mean, Citizen Thomas Paine, and His Grace the **** of *******. I am not &s;o great a leveller as to put the&s;e two great men on a par, either in the &s;tate, or the republick of letters: but, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the field of glory is a field for all."</Q> It is a large one indeed, and we all may run, God knows where, in chace of glory, over the boundle&s;s expan&s;e of that wild heath, who&s;e horizon always flies before us. I a&s;&s;ure His Grace (if he will yet give me leave to call him &s;o) whatever may be &s;aid on the authority of the clubs, or of the bar, that Citizen Paine
<PB N="101" REF="170">
(who, they will have it, hunts with me in couples, and who only moves as I drag him along), has a &s;ufficient activity in his own na|tive benevolence to di&s;po&s;e and enable him to take the lead for him&s;elf. He is ready to bla&s;pheme his God, to in&s;ult his king, and to libel the con&s;titution of his country, without any provocation from me, or any encourage|ment from His Grace. I a&s;&s;ure him, that I &s;hall not be guilty of the inju&s;tice of charging Mr. Paine's next work again&s;t religion and human &s;ociety, upon His Grace's excellent &s;peech in the Hou&s;e of Lords. I farther a&s;&s;ure this noble Duke, that I neither encouraged nor provoked that worthy citizen to &s;eek for plenty, liberty, &s;afety, ju&s;tice or lenity, in the famine, in the pri&s;ons, in the decrees of convention, in the revolutionary tribunal, and in the guillotine of Paris, rather than quietly to take up with what he could find in the glutted markets, the unbarricadoed &s;treets, the drow&s;y Old Bailey judges, or, at wor&s;t, the airy, whole|&s;ome pillory of Old England. The choice of country was his own ta&s;te. The writings were the effects of his own zeal. In &s;pite of his friend Dr. Prie&s;tley, he was a free agent. I admit, indeed, that my prai&s;es of the Briti&s;h
<PB N="102" REF="171">
government loaded with all its encumbrances; clogged with its peers and its beef; its par&s;ons and its pudding; its Commons and its beer; and its dull &s;lavi&s;h liberty of going about ju&s;t as one plea&s;es, had &s;omething to provoke a Jockey of Norfolk<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Paine is a Norfolk man, from Thetford.</NOTE>, who was in&s;pired with the re&s;olute ambition of becoming a citizen of France, to do &s;omething which might ren|der him worthy of naturalization in that grand a&s;ylum of per&s;ecuted merit: &s;omething which &s;hould intitle him to a place in the &s;enate of the adoptive country of all the gallant, gene|rous and humane. This, I &s;ay, was po&s;&s;ible. But the truth is (with great deference to His Grace I &s;ay it) Citizen Paine acted without any provocation at all; he acted &s;olely from the native impul&s;es of his own excellent heart.</P>
<P>His Grace, like an able orator, as he is, begins with giving me a great deal of prai&s;e for talents which I do not po&s;&s;e&s;s. He does this to intitle him&s;elf, on the credit of this gratuitous kindne&s;s, to exaggerate my abu&s;e of the parts which his bounty, and not that of nature has be&s;towed upon me. In this, too,
<PB N="103" REF="172">
he has conde&s;cended to copy Mr. Er&s;kine. The&s;e prie&s;ts (I hope they will excu&s;e me: I mean prie&s;ts of the Rights of Man) begin by crowning me with their flowers and their fillets, and bedewing me with their odours, as a preface to their knocking me on the head with their con&s;ecrated axes. I have injured, &s;ay they, the Con&s;titution; and I have aban|doned the whig party and the whig principles that I profe&s;&s;ed. I do not mean, my dear &s;ir, to defend my&s;elf again&s;t His Grace. I have not much intere&s;t in what the world &s;hall think or &s;ay of me; as little has the world an intere&s;t in what I &s;hall think or &s;ay of any one in it; and I wi&s;h that His Grace had &s;uffered an unhappy man to enjoy, in his re|treat, the melancholy privileges of ob&s;curity and &s;orrow. At any rate, I have &s;poken, and I have written on the &s;ubject. If I have written or &s;poken &s;o poorly as to be quite forgot, a fre&s;h apology will not make a more la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I mu&s;t let the tree lie as it falls."</Q> Perhaps I mu&s;t take &s;ome &s;hame to my&s;elf. I confe&s;s that I have acted on my own principles of government, and not on tho&s;e of His Grace, which are, I dare &s;ay, profound and wi&s;e; but which I do not
<PB N="104" REF="173">
pretend to under&s;tand. As to the party to which he alludes, and which has long taken its leave of me, I believe the principles of the book which he condemns, are very conformable to the opinions of many of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and mo&s;t grave in that de&s;cription of politicians. A few indeed, who, I admit, are equally re&s;pect|able in all points, differ from me, and talk His Grace's language. I am too feeble to contend with them. They have the field to them&s;elves. There are others very young and very ingenious per&s;ons, who form, pro|bably, the large&s;t part of what His Grace, I believe, is plea&s;ed to con&s;ider as that party. Some of them were not born into the world, and all of them were children, when I en|tered into that connexion. I give due credit to the cen&s;orial brow, to the broad phylac|teries, and to the impo&s;ing gravity of tho&s;e magi&s;terial rabbins and doctors in the cabala of political &s;cience. I admit that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"wi&s;dom is as the grey hair to man, and that learning is like honourable old age."</Q> But, at a time when liberty is a good deal talked of, perhaps I might be excu&s;ed, if I caught &s;omething of the general indocility. It might not be &s;ur|pri&s;ing, if I lengthened my chain a link or
<PB N="105" REF="174">
two, and in an age of relaxed di&s;cipline, gave a trifling indulgence to my own notions. If that could be allowed, perhaps I might &s;ome|times (by accident, and without an unpardon|able crime) tru&s;t as much to my own very careful and very laborious, though, perhaps, &s;omewhat purblind di&s;qui&s;itions, as to their &s;oaring, intuitive, eagle-eyed authority; but the modern liberty is a precious thing. It mu&s;t not be profaned by too vulgar an u&s;e. It belongs only to the cho&s;en few, who are born to the hereditary repre&s;entation of the whole democracy, and who leave nothing at all, no, not the offal, to us poor outca&s;ts of the plebeian race.</P>
<P>Among&s;t tho&s;e gentlemen who came to au|thority, as &s;oon, or &s;ooner than they came of age, I do not mean to include His Grace. With all tho&s;e native titles to empire over our minds which di&s;tingui&s;h the others, he has a large &s;hare of experience. He certainly ought to under&s;tand the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution better than I do. He has &s;tudied it in the fundamental part. For one election I have &s;een, he has been concerned in twenty. Nobody is le&s;s of a vi&s;ionary theori&s;t; no|body
<PB N="106" REF="175">
has drawn his &s;peculations more from practice. No Peer has conde&s;cended to &s;u|perintend with more vigilance the declining franchi&s;es of the poor Commons. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"With thrice great Hermes he has out-watched the bear."</Q> Often have his candles been burned to the &s;nuff, and glimmered and &s;tunk in the &s;ockets, whil&s;t he grew pale at his con|&s;titutional &s;tudies; long &s;leeple&s;s nights has he wa&s;ted; long, laborious, &s;hiftle&s;s journies has he made, and great &s;ums has he expended, in order to &s;ecure the purity, the independ|ence, and the &s;obriety of elections, and to give a check, if po&s;&s;ible, to the ruinous charges that go nearly to the de&s;truction of the right of election it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e his labours, his Grace will be plea&s;ed to forgive me, if my zeal, le&s;s enlight|ened to be &s;ure than his by midnight lamps and &s;tudies, has pre&s;umed to talk too favour|ably of this Con&s;titution, and even to &s;ay &s;ome|thing &s;ounding like approbation of that body which has the honour to reckon his Grace at the head of it. Tho&s;e who di&s;like this par|tiality, or, if his Grace plea&s;es, this flattery of mine, have a comfort at hand. I may be
<PB N="107" REF="176">
refuted and brought to &s;hame by the mo&s;t convincing of all refutations, a practical re|futation. Every individual Peer for him&s;elf may &s;hew that I was ridiculou&s;ly wrong; the whole body of tho&s;e noble per&s;ons may refute me for the whole corps. If they plea&s;e, they are more powerful advocates again&s;t them|&s;elves, than a thou&s;and &s;cribblers like me can be in their favour. If I were even po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e powers which his Grace, in order to heighten my offence, is plea&s;ed to attribute to me, there would be little difference. The eloquence of Mr. Er&s;kine might &s;ave Mr. ***** from the gallows, but no eloquence could &s;ave Mr. Jack&s;on from the effects of his own potion.</P>
<P>In that unfortunate book of mine, which is put in the <HI>index expurgatorius</HI> of the modern whigs, I might have &s;poken too favourably not only of tho&s;e who wear coronets, but of tho&s;e who wear crowns. Kings however have not only long arms, but &s;trong ones too. A great Northern Potentate for in&s;tance, is able in one moment, and with one bold &s;troke of his diplomatick pen, to efface all the volumes which I could write in a century, or which
<PB N="108" REF="177">
the mo&s;t laborious publici&s;ts of Germany ever carried to the fair of Leip&s;ick, as an apology for monarchs and monarchy. Whil&s;t I, or any other poor puny private &s;ophi&s;t, was defending the declaration of Pilnitz, his Maje&s;ty might refute me by the treaty of B&acirc;&s;le. Such a mo|narch may de&s;troy one republick becau&s;e it had a king at its head, and he may balance this extraordinary act by &s;ounding another re|publick that has cut off the head of its king. I defended that great Potentate for a&s;&s;ociating in a grand alliance for the pre&s;ervation of the old governments of Europe; but he puts me to &s;ilence by delivering up all tho&s;e govern|ments (his own virtually included) to the new &s;y&s;tem of France. If he is accu&s;ed before the Pari&s;ian tribunal (con&s;tituted for the trial of kings) for having polluted the &s;oil of liberty by the tracks of his di&s;ciplined &s;laves, he clears him&s;elf by &s;urrendering the fine&s;t parts of Germany (with a hand&s;ome cut of his own territories) to the offended maje&s;ty of the re|gicides of France. Can I re&s;i&s;t this? Am I re&s;pon&s;ible for it, if with a torch in his hand, and a rope about his neck, he makes <HI>amende honorable</HI> to the <HI>Sans-Culotterie</HI> of the republick one and indivi&s;ible? In that humiliating atti|tude,

<P>What I &s;ay of the German Princes, that I &s;ay of all the other dignities and all the other in&s;titutions of the Holy Roman Empire. If they have a mind to de&s;troy them&s;elves, they may put their advocates to &s;ilence and their advi&s;ers to &s;hame. I have often prai&s;ed the Aulick Council. It is very true I did &s;o. I thought it a tribunal, as well formed as hu|man wi&s;dom could form a tribunal, for co|ercing the great, the rich and the powerful;
<PB N="113" REF="182">
for obliging them to &s;ubmit their necks to the imperial laws, and to tho&s;e of nature and of nations; a tribunal well conceived for ex|tirpating peculation, corruption and oppre&s;|&s;ion, from all the parts of that va&s;t heteroge|neous ma&s;s called the Germanic Body. I &s;hould not be inclined to retract the&s;e prai&s;es upon any of the ordinary lap&s;es into which human infirmity will fall; they might &s;till &s;tand, though &s;ome of their <HI>conclu&s;ums</HI> &s;hould ta&s;te of the prejudices of country or of faction, whether political or religious. Some degree, even of corruption, &s;hould not make me think them guilty of &s;uicide; but if we could &s;up|po&s;e, that the Aulick Council not regarding duty, or even common decorum, li&s;tening neither to the &s;ecret admonitions of con&s;ci|ence, nor to the publick voice of fame, &s;ome of the members ba&s;ely abandoning their po&s;t, and others continuing in it, only the more infamou&s;ly to betray it, &s;hould give a judg|ment &s;o &s;hamele&s;s and &s;o pro&s;titute, of &s;uch mon&s;trous and even portentous corruption, that no example in the hi&s;tory of human de|pravity, or even in the fictions of po&euml;tick imagination, could po&s;&s;ibly match it; if it &s;hould be a judgment which with cold un|feeling

cruelty, after long deliberations &s;hould condemn millions of innocent people to ex|tortion, to rapine and to blood, and &s;hould devote &s;ome of the fine&s;t countries upon earth to ravage and de&s;olation&mdash;does any one think that any &s;ervile apologies of mine, or any &s;trutting and bullying in&s;olence of their own, can &s;ave them from the ruin that mu&s;t fall on all in&s;titutions of dignity or of authority that are perverted from their purport to the op|pre&s;&s;ion of human nature in others, and to its di&s;grace in them&s;elves. As the wi&s;dom of men makes &s;uch in&s;titutions, the folly of men de&s;troys them. Whatever we may pretend, there is always more in the &s;oundne&s;s of the materials, than in the fa&s;hion of the work. The order of a good building is &s;omething. But if it be wholly declined from its perpen|dicular; if the cement is loo&s;e and incohe|rent; if the &s;tones are &s;caling with every change of the weather, and the whole top|pling on our heads, what matter is it whether we are cru&s;hed by a Corinthian or a Dorick ruin?

<P>I have been &s;timulated, I know not how, to give you this trouble by what very few, except my&s;elf, would think worth any trouble at all. In a &s;peech in the Hou&s;e of Lords, I have been attacked for the defence of a &s;cheme of government, in which that body inheres, and in which alone it can exi&s;t. Peers of Great Bri|tain may become as penitent as the Sovereign of Pru&s;&s;ia. They may repent of what they have done in a&s;&s;ertion of the honour of their King, and in favour of their own &s;afety. But never the gloom that lowers over the fortune of the cau&s;e, nor any thing which the great may do towards ha&s;tening their own fall, can make
<PB N="116" REF="185">
me repent of what I have done by pen or voice (the only arms I po&s;&s;e&s;s) in favour of the order of things into which I was born, and in which I fondly hoped to die.</P>
<P>In the long &s;eries of ages which have fur|ni&s;hed the matter of hi&s;tory, never was &s;o beautiful and &s;o augu&s;t a &s;pectacle pre&s;ented to the moral eye, as Europe afforded the day before the revolution in France. I knew in|deed that this pro&s;perity contained in it&s;elf the &s;eeds of its own danger. In one part of the &s;ociety it cau&s;ed laxity and debility. In the other it produced bold &s;pirits and dark de&s;igns. A fal&s;e philo&s;ophy pa&s;&s;ed from academies into courts, and the great them&s;elves were infected with the theories which conducted to their ruin. Knowledge which in the two la&s;t cen|turies either did not exi&s;t at all, or exi&s;ted &s;olidly on right principles and in cho&s;en hands, was now diffu&s;ed, weakened and perverted. General wealth loo&s;ened morals, relaxed vi|gilance, and increa&s;ed pre&s;umption. Men of talent began to compare, in the partition of the common &s;tock of public pro&s;perity, the proportions of the dividends, with the merits of the claimants. As u&s;ual, they found their
<PB N="117" REF="186">
portion not equal to their e&s;timate (or perhaps to the public e&s;timate) of their own worth. When it was once di&s;covered by the revolu|tion in France that a &s;truggle between e&s;ta|bli&s;hment and rapacity could be maintained, though but for one year, and in one place, I was &s;ure that a practicable breach was made in the whole order of things and in every country. Religion, that held the materials of the fabrick together, was fir&s;t &s;y&s;tematically loo&s;ened. All other opinions, under the name of prejudices, mu&s;t fall along with it; and Pro|perty, left undefended by principles, became a repo&s;itory of &s;poils to tempt cupidity, and not a magazine to furni&s;h arms for defence. I knew, that attacked on all &s;ides by the in|fernal energies of talents &s;et in action by vice and di&s;order, authority could not &s;tand upon authority alone. It wanted &s;ome other &s;up|port than the poi&s;e of its own gravity. Si|tuations formerly &s;upported per&s;ons. It now became nece&s;&s;ary that per&s;onal qualities &s;hould &s;upport &s;ituations. Formerly, where authority was found, wi&s;dom and virtue were pre&s;umed. But now the veil was torn, and to keep off &s;a|crilegious intru&s;ion, it was nece&s;&s;ary that in the &s;anctuary of government &s;omething &s;hould be
<PB N="118" REF="187">
di&s;clo&s;ed not only venerable, but dreadful. Government was at once to &s;hew it&s;elf full of virtue and full of force. It was to invite partizans by making it appear to the world that a generous cau&s;e was to be a&s;&s;erted; one fit for a generous people to engage in. From pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was it to expect re&s;olute defence? No! It mu&s;t have warm advocates and pa&s;&s;ionate defenders, which an heavy, di&s;|contented acquie&s;cence never could produce. What a ba&s;e and fooli&s;h thing is it for any con&s;olidated body of authority to &s;ay, or to act as if it &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"I will put my tru&s;t not in my own virtue, but in your patience; I will in|dulge in effeminacy, in indolence, in cor|ruption; I will give way to all my perver&s;e and vitious humours, becau&s;e you cannot puni&s;h me without the hazard of ruining your&s;elves?"</Q></P>
<P>I wi&s;hed to warn the people again&s;t the greate&s;t of all evils: a blind and furious &s;pirit of innovation, under the name of reform. I was indeed well aware that power rarely re|forms it&s;elf. So it is undoubtedly when all is quiet about it. But I was in hopes that pro|vident fear might prevent fruitle&s;s penitence.
<PB N="119" REF="188">
I tru&s;ted that danger might produce at lea&s;t circum&s;pection; I flattered my&s;elf in a mo|ment like this that nothing would be added to make authority top-heavy; that the very mo|ment of an earth-quake would not be the time cho&s;en for adding a &s;tory to our hou&s;es. I hoped to &s;ee the &s;ure&s;t of all reforms, perhaps the only &s;ure reform, the cea&s;ing to do ill. In the mean time I wi&s;hed to the people, the wi&s;dom of knowing how to tolerate a con|dition which none of their efforts can render much more than tolerable. It was a con|dition, however, in which every thing was to be found that could enable them to live to nature, and if &s;o they plea&s;ed, to live to virtue and to honour.</P>
<P>I do not repent that I thought better of tho&s;e to whom I wi&s;hed well, than they will &s;uffer me long to think that they de&s;erved. Far from repenting, I would to God, that new faculties had been called up in me, in favour not of this or that man, or this or that &s;y&s;tem, but of the general vital principle that whil&s;t it was in its vigour produced the &s;tate of things tran&s;mitted to us from our fathers; but which, through the joint operation of the
<PB N="120" REF="189">
abu&s;es of authority and liberty, may peri&s;h in our hands. I am not of opinion that the race of men, and the commonwealths they create, like the bodies of individuals, grow effete and languid and bloodle&s;s, and o&s;&s;ify by the ne|ce&s;&s;ities of their own conformation, and the fatal operation of longevity and time. The&s;e analogies between bodies natural and politick, though they may &s;ome times illu&s;trate argu|ments, furni&s;h no argument of them&s;elves. They are but too often u&s;ed under the colour of a &s;pecious philo&s;ophy, to find apologies for the de&s;pair of lazine&s;s and pu&s;illanimity, and to excu&s;e the want of all manly efforts, when the exigencies of our country call for them the more loudly.</P>
<P>How often has public calamity been arre&s;ted on the very brink of ruin by the &s;ea&s;onable energy of a &s;ingle man? Have we no &s;uch man among&s;t us? I am as &s;ure as I am of my being, that one vigorous mind without office, with|out &s;ituation, without public functions of any kind (at a time when the want of &s;uch a thing is felt, as I am &s;ure it is) I &s;ay, one &s;uch man, confiding in the aid of God, and full of ju&s;t reliance in his own fortitude, vigour, enter|prize
<PB N="121" REF="190">
and per&s;everance, would fir&s;t draw to him &s;ome few like him&s;elf, and then that mul|titudes, hardly thought to be in exi&s;tence, would appear and troop about him.</P>
<P>If I &s;aw this au&s;picious beginning, baffled and fru&s;trated as I am, yet on the very verge of a timely grave, abandoned abroad and de|&s;olate at home, &s;tripped of my boa&s;t, my hope, my con&s;olation, my helper, my coun|&s;ellor and my guide, (you know in part what I have lo&s;t, and would to God I could clear my&s;elf of all neglect and fault in that lo&s;s) yet thus, even thus, I would rake up the fire under all the a&s;hes that oppre&s;s it. I am no longer patient of the public eye; nor am I of force to win my way and to ju&s;tle and elbow in a crowd. But even in &s;olitude, &s;omething may be done for &s;ociety. The meditations of the clo&s;et have infected &s;enates with a &s;ubtle frenzy, and inflamed armies with the brands of the furies. The cure might come from the &s;ame &s;ource with the di&s;temper. I would add my part to tho&s;e who would animate the people (who&s;e hearts are yet right) to new exertions in the old cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="191">
Novelty is not the only &s;ource of zeal. Why &s;hould not a Maccabeus and his brethren ari&s;e to a&s;&s;ert the honour of the ancient law, and to defend the temple of their forefathers, with as ardent a &s;pirit, as can in&s;pire any innovator to de&s;troy the monuments of the piety and the glory of antient ages? It is not a hazarded a&s;&s;ertion, it is a great truth, that when once things are gone out of their ordinary cour&s;e, it is by acts out of the ordinary cour&s;e they can alone be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. Republican &s;pirit can only be combated by a &s;pirit of the &s;ame nature: of the &s;ame nature, but informed with another principle and pointing to another end. I would per&s;uade a re&s;i&s;tance both to the cor|ruption and to the reformation that prevails. It will not be the weaker, but much the &s;tronger, for combating both together. A victory over real corruptions would enable us to baffle the &s;purious and pretended reforma|tions. I would not wi&s;h to excite, or even to tolerate, that kind of evil &s;pirit which evokes the powers of hell to rectify the di&s;orders of the earth. No! I would add my voice with better, and I tru&s;t, more potent charms, to draw down ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom and fortitude from heaven, for the correction of human vice,
<PB N="123" REF="192">
and the recalling of human errour from the devious ways into which it has been betrayed. I would wi&s;h to call the impul&s;es of indi|viduals at once to the aid and to the controul of authority. By this which I call the true republican &s;pirit, paradoxical as it may appear, monarchies alone can be re&s;cued from the imbecillity of courts and the madne&s;s of the crowd. This republican &s;pirit would not &s;uffer men in high place to bring ruin on their country and on them&s;elves. It would reform, not by de&s;troying, but by &s;aving, the great, the rich and the powerful. Such a republican &s;pirit, we perhaps fondly conceive to have animated the di&s;tingui&s;hed heroes and patriots of old, who knew no mode of policy but re|ligion and virtue. The&s;e, they would have paramount to all con&s;titutions; they would not &s;uffer Monarchs or Senates or popular A&s;&s;emblies, under pretences of dignity or au|thority, or freedom, to &s;hake off tho&s;e moral riders which rea&s;on has appointed to govern every &s;ort of rude power. The&s;e, in appear|ance loading them by their weight, do by that pre&s;&s;ure augment their e&s;&s;ential force. The mo|mentum is encrea&s;ed by the extraneous weight. It is true in moral, as it is in mechanical &s;cience. It is true, not only in the draught,
<PB N="124" REF="193">
but in the race. The&s;e riders of the great, in effect, hold the reins which guide them in their cour&s;e, and wear the &s;pur that &s;timulates them to the goals of honour and of &s;afety. The great mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the dominion of pru|dence and of virtue; or none will long &s;ubmit to the dominion of the great.<Q>"<HI>Dis te minorem quod geris imperas.</HI>"</Q> This is the feudal tenure which they cannot alter.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear Sir, things are in a bad &s;tate. I do not deny a good &s;hare of diligence, a very great &s;hare of ability, and much pub|lick virtue to tho&s;e who direct our affairs. But they are encumbered, not aided, by their very in&s;truments, and by all the apparatus of the &s;tate. I think that our Mini&s;try (though there are things again&s;t them, which neither you nor I can di&s;&s;emble, and which grieve to the heart) is by far the mo&s;t hone&s;t and by far the wi&s;e&s;t &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration in Europe. Their fall would be no trivial calamity.</P>
<P>Not meaning to depreciate the Minority in Parliament, who&s;e talents are al&s;o great, and
<PB N="125" REF="194">
to whom I do not deny virtues, their &s;y&s;tem &s;eems to me to be fundamentally wrong. But whether wrong or right, they have not enough of coherence among them&s;elves, nor of e&s;ti|mation with the publick, nor of numbers. They cannot make up an admini&s;tration. No|thing is more vi&s;ible. Many other things are again&s;t them, which I do not charge as faults, but reckon among national misfortunes. Ex|traordinary things mu&s;t be done, or one of the parties cannot &s;tand as a Mini&s;try, nor the other even as an Oppo&s;ition. They cannot change their &s;ituations, nor can any u&s;eful coalition be made between them. I do not &s;ee the mode of it, nor the way to it. This a&s;pect of things I do not contemplate with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I well know that every thing of the daring kind which I &s;peak of, is critical&mdash;But the times are critical. New things in a new world! I &s;ee no hopes in the common tracks. If men are not to be found who can be got to feel within them &s;ome impul&s;e
<Q>"&mdash;<HI>quod nequeo mon&s;trare, &amp; &s;entio tantum,</HI>"</Q>
and which makes them impatient of the pre|&s;ent; if none can be got to feel that private per&s;ons may &s;ometimes a&s;&s;ume that &s;ort of ma|gi&s;tracy
<PB N="126" REF="195">
which does not depend on the nomina|tion of Kings, or the election of the people, but has an inherent and &s;elf-exi&s;tent power which both would recogni&s;e; I &s;ee nothing in the world to hope.</P>
<P>If I &s;aw &s;uch a group beginning to clu&s;ter, &s;uch as they are, they &s;hould have (all that I can give) my prayers and my advice. People talk of war, or cry for peace&mdash;have they to the bottom con&s;idered the que&s;tions either of war, or peace, upon the &s;cale of the exi&s;ting world? No. I fear they have not.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould not you, your&s;elf, be one of tho&s;e to enter your name in &s;uch a li&s;t as I &s;peak of. You are young; you have great talents, you have a clear head, you have a natural, fluent and unforced elocution; your ideas are ju&s;t, your &s;entiments benevolent, open and enlarged&mdash;but this is too big for your mode&s;ty. Oh! this mode&s;ty in time and place is a charming virtue, and the grace of all other virtues. But it is &s;ometimes the wor&s;t enemy they have. Let him, who&s;e print I gave you the other day, be engraved in your memory! Had it plea&s;ed Providence to have
<PB N="127" REF="196">
&s;pared him for the trying &s;ituations that &s;eem to be coming on, notwith&s;tanding that he was &s;ometimes a little di&s;pirited by the di&s;po&s;ition which we thought &s;hewn to depre&s;s him and &s;et him a&s;ide; yet he was always buoyed up again; and on one or two occa&s;ions, he di&s;|covered what might be expected from the vigour and elevation of his mind, from his unconquerable fortitude, and from the extent of his re&s;ources for every purpo&s;e of &s;pecu|lation and of action. Remember him, my friend, who in the highe&s;t degree honoured and re&s;pected you, and remember that great parts are a great tru&s;t. Remember too that mi&s;taken or mi&s;applied virtues, if they are not as pernicious as vice, fru&s;trate at lea&s;t their own natural tendencies, and di&s;appoint the purpo&s;es of the great giver.</P>
