<HEAD>THE State of the Exci&s;e After the UNION, compar'd with what it is now.</HEAD>
<P>THE burden of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Taxes, indu&s;triou&s;ly buzzed about into the Ears of the Commonalty, by &s;uch as upon other Views were prejudiced again&s;t the pre&s;ent Trea|ty of Union, has no doubt contributed in a great mea&s;ure, to work them into &s;o general a ferment again&s;t it. Their weakne&s;s and incapacity to inquire into, and examine the&s;e Matters, joined with &s;ome mean prejudices from the fear of lo&s;ing the Crown and the like, made them a &s;ubject ve|ry ea&s;y to be wrought upon this way.</P>
<P>That the De&s;ign might have the better Succe&s;s, all me|thods have been u&s;ed, to &s;crue up the&s;e Burdens to extra|vagant heights, that their appearance might be more fright|ful. It cannot be denied that in an Affair of this moment, to &s;et Matters in their due light, was the duty of every Per&s;on that ventured to give the Publick his Opinion; but to fi&s;h for ways to magnify things, &s;eems to have had &s;ome other End than the real Service of the Nation.</P>
<P>To give a fair and di&s;tinct view, and to rectify Mi&s;takes as to the&s;e on Liquors, is the de&s;ign of the following Sheet. For under&s;tanding of which, the Reader is de&s;ired to be in|formed of the following Particulars.</P>

<P>BY the above Calcul, it appears, how little ground there is for the common Report &s;pread about the country o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> our two <HI>Penny</HI> Ale being doubled in its Price; &s;ince &s;up|po&s;ing
<PB N="6" REF="7">
the Exci&s;e to be Exacted in its Rigour it hightens the Price only 3&frac12; <HI>Pennies per</HI> Pint, or 4 at mo&s;t. And con&s;i|dering that the Exci&s;e in <HI>England</HI> is managed by Collection, t cannot be thought the Surveys will be &s;o &s;evere as here, where the Farming the Exci&s;e by Roup Screws up its Price, and the Taxmen for their own gain Squeeze the poor Peo|ple to the outmo&s;t Law allows, if not beyond it.</P>
<P>This being the &s;tate of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Exci&s;e, with regard to Ale above 6 <HI>&s;h. &s;terl per</HI> Barrel; the le&s;&s;er Exci&s;e &s;up|po&s;ed largely to be 2 <HI>Pennies per</HI> Pint, falls next to be con|&s;idered. As to which that we &s;hall be ea&s;ier, is obvious, &s;ince the &s;malle&s;t Ale we can Brew now, pays 3 <HI>Pennies per</HI> Pint; and Ale of 9 <HI>Pennies</HI> true Price to the Brewer, which falls under the le&s;&s;er Exci&s;e, not being a full fourth part weaker then the pre&s;ent two <HI>Penny</HI> Ale, will be no contem|ptible Table Drink, and no &s;mall ea&s;e to the Poor Trades People, who will then find good Drink for 16 <HI>Pennies per</HI> Pint, whereas now none is under two <HI>Pence.</HI> This appears plainer by the following Calcul.</P>

<P>FRom the&s;e two Views of the greater and le&s;&s;er Exci&s;e, It not only appears that the greater is no &s;uch hideous mon&s;ter, as is commonly believed; but al&s;o that taking both Jointly we &s;hould be full as ea&s;y as now, e&s;pecially with regard to
<PB N="7" REF="8">
the Poorer &s;ort of People. Nay further, we &s;hould be much ea&s;ier, than we have been for &s;everal Years &s;ince the Revo|lution. For from the 1&s;t of <HI>June</HI> 1693, to the 1&s;t of <HI>May</HI> 1695, our Exci&s;e was 2 <HI>Merks per</HI> Boll, and 3 <HI>Pennies per</HI> Pint, in all 6 <HI>Pennies per</HI> Pint, only half a <HI>Penny</HI> le&s;s than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> greater Exci&s;e. And from 1&s;t of <HI>September</HI> 1695, to <HI>March</HI> 1697 5 <HI>Pennies per</HI> Pint, from thence to <HI>March</HI> 1698, 4 <HI>Pennies,</HI> and from thence to <HI>March</HI> 99, 6 <HI>Pennies</HI>; So that for a Tract of 6 Years, we were under an Exci&s;e near equal to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in quantity, but va&s;tly more burden|&s;ome, as will appear by the following two Con&s;iderations, 1<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> That the 4 Dear Years were part of the&s;e &s;ix, which con&s;idering the circum&s;tance of the Poor were hard enough under any Exci&s;e; but this is only a temporary Con&s;iderati|on, the next is perpetual, <HI>viz.</HI> That we neither had then, nor have now, any di&s;tinction betwixt Small and Strong Ale; The con&s;equence of which, was that the Brewers find|ing all Ale equal as to Exci&s;e, cho&s;e rather to Brew Strong Ale, which would yield them &s;ix <HI>Pennies</HI> profite <HI>per</HI> Pint, than &s;mall which yielded only two <HI>Pennies,</HI> yet Payed the &s;ame Exci&s;e; and accordingly the Ale commonly Sold then was 3 <HI>Pence per</HI> Pint, or 2 <HI>Pence</HI> and a Plack, which the poor People behooved either to Buy or Drink Water. Where|as &s;hould the Brewers Brew &s;trong Ale under the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Exci&s;e, yet there will &s;till be good whol&s;om Drink for the poorer &s;ort at an ea&s;ie Rate, by rea&s;on of the di&s;tinction of the Exci&s;e.</P>
<P>If what is here advanced be true, as there is little rea&s;on to doubt, &s;ince it depends on Uncontraverted matters of fact, and a Plain and &s;imple calcul: It may &s;eem odd, that the Author of the <HI>Short View of our pre&s;ent Trade and Taxes,</HI> Page 4. Should &s;uppo&s;e each Boll of Malt will produce 6. <HI>&s;h.</HI><PB N="8" REF="9"><HI>&s;terl.</HI> Exci&s;e, and &s;hould on this build his calcul of the In|crea&s;e of Exci&s;e in ca&s;e of the Union. No doubt, a Brewer for a Wager may produce near 8 <HI>&s;h.</HI> Exci&s;e from a Boll, by Brewing Ale at 10 <HI>pennies per</HI> Pint true value; but he's a Mad Man if he does &s;o for ordinary, &s;ince had he Brewed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> at 9 <HI>pennies,</HI> the Exci&s;e would only be near 2 <HI>&s;h.</HI> 8 <HI>d. &s;terl.</HI> and &s;ince we are &s;uppo&s;ing, I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e and make good, that a Brewer may bring the Exci&s;e of a Boll of Malt to 17 <HI>&s;h.</HI> and 4 <HI>d. Scots,</HI> by Brewing only 4. Gallons of very &s;trong Ale from it, which at 4 <HI>&s;h.</HI> 4 <HI>d. Scots per</HI> Gallon makes the fore+&s;aid Sum. But the Brewer will be regula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> by none of our &s;uppo&s;itions; he'll Brew &s;uch Ale, as will be&s;t bear the re|&s;pective Exci&s;es, and at the &s;ame time plea&s;e his Cu&s;tomers</P>
