<HEAD>An Hi&s;torical Account of the Bitter Sufferings
and Melancholly Circum&s;tances of the Epi&s;|copal
Church in Scotland, under the Bar|barous
U&s;age and Bloody Per&s;ecution of the
Presbyterian Church Government, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT is neither to An&s;wer the Clamours of tho&s;e, who Rail
at the <HI>Scots</HI> in General, nor to Vindicate the Church
or Nation in that part of <HI>Britain,</HI> again&s;t the Out-Cries
and Complaints of the Epi&s;copal Party, that
this Tract is at this time made publick.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e de&s;erves no An&s;wer, being Noi&s;e with|out
Ground, and Clamour without Fact, and will, as al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
&s;uch Furious Incon&s;i&s;tent E&s;capes generally do, die with
Time. The &s;econd needs no An&s;wer, that Party being fully
An&s;wer'd, and fairly Silenced already, partly by the Con|viction
of their own Con&s;ciences, and compleatly by the late
Reverend and Worthy Doctor <HI>Rule</HI> Principal of the College
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> in his An&s;wer to five Pamphlets printed in b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|half of the Epi&s;copal Clergy.</P>
<P>But this De&s;ign &s;eems to me equally nece&s;&s;ary, both to the
Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in this I&s;land, and to the general Peace
which every good Man wi&s;hes and hopes for among us, and
which, by the late happy Union, &s;eems nearer in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s Ap|proach
to us: And in order to which, I thought it a very
u&s;eful piece of Work, to &s;tate the Matter of Fact between the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> and the Di&s;&s;enters there, and enquire
into &s;ome things, in which the World has been not a little
impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>I do confe&s;s, when I came fir&s;t into <HI>Scotland,</HI> I was in no|thing
more &s;urprized, than in the Matter of the Di&s;&s;enters&punc;
I had, with the Generality of People in <HI>England,</HI> always be|liev'd,
tho I had wi&s;ht it otherwi&s;e, that the Epi&s;copal Cler|gy
<PB N="4" REF="3">
in <HI>Scotland</HI> were intirely depo&s;ed and &s;uppre&s;t, per&s;ecuted,
and not permitted to keep up any Form of a Separation in
Religious Matters.</P>
<P>And I think my &s;elf oblig'd to enter into this Ca&s;e, not
only to do the Kirk of <HI>Scotland</HI> Ju&s;tice, and defend her a|gain&s;t
her Enemies, but to defend her again&s;t her Friends:
If a Rake or a Scoundrel ill-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">reat me, I think it not worth
my notice, 'tis below my Concern, he does it becau&s;e he is a
Rake and a Scoundrel, and the Slander goes but a little way;
But if a Man of Virtue, a Man of Sen&s;e, a Man of Religi|on,
if a good man cen&s;ures me; I am concerned at it on a
Twofold Account, 1. Becau&s;e his Mi&s;take will Wound me
with other Good Men, and make the Slander be believed. 2.
Becau&s;e I am willing to undeceive him, and prevent his Ex|po&s;ing
him&s;elf in his Reproaching me, of which, when it
&s;hall appear I am Innocent, he will be A&s;hamed, and 'tis a
Friend&s;hip to him, to prevent his Blu&s;hes.</P>
<P>That the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> has carryed it with great Heat,
and rigid Severity (to put it now in the &s;ofte&s;t Terms I can)
towards the Epi&s;copal Clergy Di&s;&s;enting from them, and
Depo&s;ed by them at the Revolution, is the Charge I have al|ways
met with again&s;t them: A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d this is not only publi&s;hed
in Print, with Aggravations, Exclamations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by their
own Party, and that in &s;everal Pamphlets, and indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly
&s;pread over <HI>England,</HI> and which I e&s;teem wor&s;t of all,
it has pa&s;s'd too much for granted, and been too much re|ceived
and believed among the be&s;t &s;ort of People in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
Friends to the Con&s;titution, and Friends to the E&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of Religion in that Kingdom, who, tho they do
not take all for granted by whole Sale, which Noi&s;y and
Cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">orous People have publi&s;hed, yet having never &s;een any
Auth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">ick Vindication, or Direct An&s;wer to the&s;e Charges,
are b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ught to believe &s;o much of it, as makes them enter|tain
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">u&s;tly a too mean Opinion of their Brethren in <HI>Scot|land.</HI></P>
<P>To undeceive &s;uch, is worth any hone&s;t Mans while, and
tho I am perfectly a Volunteer in this Work on all &s;ides, I
am per&s;waded the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or the Reverend the
Mini&s;ters of that Church, cannot think it a needle&s;s Under|taking,
to let them right in the Judgment of tho&s;e, with
whom they are now more nearly joyn'd, and cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;er al|lyed
than ever, and to remove, as far as po&s;&s;ible, all Cau&s;es
of Jealou&s;y, Coldne&s;s, or Want of Charity between tho&s;e,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
who are &s;o nearly knit both in Religious Rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tion, as Pro|te&s;tants,
and al&s;o in Civil Intere&s;t, as to Safety, Liberty, and
Right.</P>
<P>The Hone&s;t, but pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iudiced People in <HI>England,</HI> who have
been impo&s;ed upon, by the publick Cryes of Sufferings,
Per&s;ecutions, Cruelties, and Mercile&s;s U&s;age of the Epi&s;copal
Party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> will, I doubt not, be plea&s;ed to be unde|ceived,
and be glad to re&s;tore the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> to their
entire Charity and good Opinion, and to have that Damp
removed, which they had, on good Ground, as they &s;uppo&s;ed,
felt on their Thoughts, when they believed, that the Exce&s;&s;es
pretended to had Truth enough in them to merit real Blame,
and that the Warmth of Northern Zeal had carryed the <HI>Scots</HI>
beyond that Moderation, which is the Beauty and Glory of
the Prote&s;tant Religion, and which I doubt not to make
appear, the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> has given Rea&s;on to believe, &s;he
at this time practi&s;es, <HI>and from the Revolution to this time has
done as much as any Church in the World.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis for the&s;e Rea&s;ons I write, 'tis for the &s;ake of the&s;e this
Book is publi&s;hed, 'tis to undeceive the Friends to Truth and
the Lovers of Peace, to remove the Prejudices of tho&s;e that
wou'd be inform'd, not of tho&s;e that &s;eek to be impo&s;ed up|on,
and hunt about for Subject to Cavil and Debate: 'Tis to
clear up the Reputation of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> among her
Friends, not among her Enemies, among the Friends to Re|ligion
in <HI>England,</HI> and among the Prote&s;tant Churches Abroad,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">his is the Rea&s;on of this Work, and the Author profe&s;&s;es to
have no other De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Not but that it may al&s;o &s;erve to &s;top the Mouths of &s;ome
People, who, with an Uncharitable Zeal, have rais'd a Cloud,
and ca&s;t Dirt on the E&s;tabli&s;ht Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> on this Ac|count,
and perhaps they may here find &s;ome Occa&s;ion to alter
their Mea&s;ures, and, with re&s;pect to their own Reputation,
change their Note; For it always weakens the Reputation of
either Per&s;on or Party, to a&s;&s;ert Fal&s;hoods, to rai&s;e Stories, that
mu&s;t, if Examined into, appear to be forged, and contrived
only to Defame.</P>
<P>Slander always flyes back upon the Head of the Slanderer,
and fir&s;t or la&s;t the Dirt he throws at others &s;ticks upon him|&s;elf,
at lea&s;t leaves &s;ome of the Filth behind it, when Time,
Truth, and Innocence clears up the Reputation of the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">her.</P>
<P>When therefore the&s;e Sheets are a little read and con&s;idered
in the World, I make no Que&s;tion, but &s;everal &s;orts of
<PB N="6" REF="5">
People may find Occa&s;ion to Blu&s;h: And <HI>I</HI> cannot have &s;o
little Charity, as not to hope they will &s;uffer the Convictions
of Truth in Fact, &s;o far to prevail upon their Rea&s;on and
Temper, as to cau&s;e them to dete&s;t the Practices of tho&s;e, who
having not been able, by any legal fair Proceedings, to charge
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> with any thing unbecoming her, as a
Chri&s;tian, a National, or a Prote&s;tant Church, have thought
to &s;upply that Defect with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of mo&s;t abominable
Slanders, depending upon the Di&s;tance of Place and Dark|ne&s;s
of Circum&s;tances, as Difficulties which would ob&s;truct
the Di&s;covery, and at lea&s;t concluding, it would &s;erve a Turn
for a Time, delude the Ignorant and Uninquiring Part of
the World, and in general, help to make the Reformation
and E&s;tabli&s;hment in <HI>Scotland</HI> odious and contemptible; and
thereby fix a Prejudice in the People of this I&s;land one again&s;t
another, a Temper they had &s;o often Occa&s;ion to make u&s;e
of, and was &s;o con&s;tantly &s;ub&s;ervient to their Mi&s;chievous
De&s;igns, that they could not fail always to reap &s;ome Ad|vantage
by it; Bad is that Cau&s;e, that flouri&s;hes only in Na|tional
Confu&s;ion, and that is always be&s;t propagated by Mi&s;|chief
and Di&s;&s;ention.</P>
<P>Nor could the Promoters of the&s;e things find a better
Handle in the World to take hold of, in order to defame and
render contemptible the <HI>Scots</HI> Presbyterians, than the Charge
of Cruelty and Per&s;ecution&mdash;. Per&s;ecution is a Word par|ticularly
hateful among Prote&s;tants, as what every Prote&s;tant
Church in the World has, fir&s;t or la&s;t, been &s;uffering under,
and the Churches of this I&s;land in e&s;pecial manner.&mdash;</P>
<P>When therefore they had gotten hold, as they thought, of
this Matter, they &s;eem'd fully &s;atisfied, that they had the Re|putation
not of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> only, but of Presbyte|rians
and Di&s;&s;enters in general, under Foot&mdash;. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To
prove the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> were of per&s;ecuting Prin|ciples,
Cruel and Tyrannical, was the ready way to ruine all
the Pro&s;pects of joyning Intere&s;ts in <HI>England</HI> between them
and the Moderate Church Men, <HI>a thing the High Party fore&s;aw
was coming forward, and which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y knew, if it ever come to pa&s;s,
would ruine the High-flying Intere&s;t.</HI> And, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> Nothing
could furni&s;h them with a more plau&s;ible ground of Sugge&s;t|ing
this upon the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> than fir&s;t to charge
it upon the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> directly.</P>
<P>Thus the Charge upon the Presbyterian Church in <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
of being Tyrannical, of a per&s;ecuting Spirit, and the
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ke, &s;erv'd the High Church Cau&s;e in <HI>England</HI> a great many
ways; And if we were to en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">er into the &s;ecret Hi&s;tory of it,
we &s;hould find, that mo&s;t of this Scandal was both formed
in <HI>England,</HI> and calculated for purpo&s;es particular to that
part of <HI>Britain:</HI> The &s;everal Pamphlets printed on that Sub|ject
were all printed in <HI>England,</HI> indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
and with as much Indu&s;try endeavour'd to be concealed in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> the Service they were to do was in <HI>England,</HI> and
they could in no wi&s;e be directly contradicted but from
<HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis with Regret <HI>I</HI> am oblig'd to acknowledge this Arti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;
of the Party has had but too much Succe&s;s, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To im|po&s;e
upon the ea&s;y and credulous People of their own Party,
and po&s;&s;e&s;s them with a Belief of all the pretended Cruelti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
and Violences practi&s;ed by the Presbyterian Church in <HI>Scot|land</HI>
upon the Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;And by con|&s;equence
fill them with prejudice again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters in
their own Country, as of the &s;ame Principle, and only
wanting the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ower to Exerci&s;e it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> But this is not all, nor, <HI>had it been all,</HI> had
this Piece been ever wrote, &s;ince the Mi&s;chief had been but of
&s;mall con&s;equence, and among them&s;elves. But <HI>I</HI> cannot
help ob&s;erving, in the &s;everal Occa&s;ions the World has had
of late to &s;peak of <HI>Scotland</HI> more than u&s;ual; this has taken
too much root among even the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> and
the&s;e of them who have been the be&s;t Friends to <HI>Scotland,</HI> that
they have been made to believe, there has been at lea&s;t too
much Truth in the General Charge, and that really the Epi&s;|copal
Party have been per&s;ecuted and &s;everely treated.</P>
<P>Nothing has been more common, than, in talking of the&s;e
things, to have the Hone&s;t People &s;peak with concern about
it, and bring it out with an, <HI>I wi&s;h the</HI> Scots <HI>would u&s;e the
Epi&s;copal Party more gently,</HI> and the like, when they have been
told it is otherwi&s;e, they would &s;hake their Heads doubting&punc;
and return, <HI>I am afraid there is &s;ome Truth in it:</HI> And to this day,
<HI>I</HI> believe <HI>I</HI> may &s;peak it without any He&s;itation, the great|e&s;t
part even of the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> are of this Opinion&punc;
that the Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> to really cru&s;h, op|pre&s;s,
per&s;ecute, and u&s;e hardly the Mini&s;ters of the Epi&s;co|pal
Party.</P>
<P>And indeed, if we con&s;ider the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tile of the &s;everal Pamph|lets
written on this Subject, the A&s;&s;urance of the Authors,
how po&s;itively they have a&s;&s;erted things; their &s;trange, yet
<PB N="8" REF="7">
frequent de&s;cending to particulars, which neverthele&s;s were
fal&s;e in Fact, and how &s;trangely they have impo&s;ed upon the
World&mdash;And withal, that not any Man, in <HI>England</HI> at
lea&s;t, has ever formally taken up this Cau&s;e, it is no wonder,
that both Friend and Enemy have received Impre&s;&s;ions, to the
prejudice of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and have taken up an
Opinion of the Truth of the&s;e things, as mo&s;t certain, and
not to be denyed.</P>
<P>Before <HI>I</HI> enter into the Matter of Fact, as it now &s;tands in
<HI>Scotland, I</HI> think it is very proper to quote a few of the parti|culars,
which the People, of whom <HI>I</HI> have been &s;peaking,
charge upon the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and which they call
Per&s;ecution, which, fir&s;t of all, cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e called Per&s;ecution,
if true: And, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> If they were to be called Per&s;ecuti|on,
can, by no means, be lay'd to the Charge of the Church.</P>
<P>As, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the Violences of the common People upon the
Revolution.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> The Depo&s;ing the Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>As to the Violences of the Mob, <HI>I</HI> would, by no means,
have <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men call that Per&s;ecution, becau&s;e the Rabbles,
in the Affair of the Revolution, were equally Violent in
<HI>England,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and promi&s;cuous in the per&s;ons, both
Church of <HI>England</HI> Rabble and Presbyterian Rabble, none
of which can be accu&s;ed by one another, nor were ever, that
<HI>I</HI> remember, ju&s;tifyed by either&mdash;But no Church Man
ought to Exclaim again&s;t a Presbyterian Rabble, le&s;t the Pa|pi&s;t
double it upon him, with a Hi&s;tory of the Church
Rabbles upon them, and they &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by this
unhappy Circum&s;tance, that, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Rabbles u&s;|ed
Violence with tho&s;e, who had Murther'd their Fathers,
Mothers, and near Relations, who had dipped their Hands
in Blood, and had prompted and appear'd in the greate&s;t
Barbarities, that any Age or Nation can parallel, and had
thereby provoked them to the highe&s;t Degree; Whereas, in
<HI>England,</HI> the Rabbles rifled, plundered, and in&s;ulted the
Hou&s;es, Parks, and Lands of peaceable Gentlemen, who had
been perfectly unconcerned in any of King <HI>James</HI>'s Malver|&s;ations,
and again&s;t whom they had no manner of Objecti|on,
but that they were <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks, or as they call'd it
in others, Di&s;affected.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, <HI>I</HI> would Advi&s;e the Gentlemen, that talk
of this as part of the Per&s;ecutions they complain of, to leave
it out of the Li&s;t&mdash;and let it ly as an Accident of the
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Revolution, and an effect of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">
a pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">ked People, in which Religion had no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ut that power being given by the Circum&s;tance of the Time, the&s;e &s;hewe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> them the Re|&s;entment
of their Bloody Treatment, in a manner, however
violent and unju&s;tifyable, yet much &s;hort of what they had
really de&s;erved; and &s;till more &s;hort of what they might rea|&s;onably
have expected.</P>
<P>Let all the Exce&s;&s;es of the Multitude therefore ly buried
under the &s;ame Charity, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> that covers your former
Barbarous Treatment: And if they did not Pi&s;tol in cold
Blood; If they did not Ty the Women to Stakes in the Sea,
and let the Tide Flow over them; If they did not Drag you
out of your Hou&s;es, and Shoot you, without giving you Time
to Commend your Souls to GOD's Mercy; If the&s;e Things
were not done, you ought to believe, none of the Po&s;terity
of the&s;e poor Innocents, that &s;o Suffered, were Alive to Re|venge
them; or that you had more Mercy from their Hands,
than you had Rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P>The&s;e things therefore cannot be called Per&s;ecution, and
the Violences of the Rabbles of the Revolution &s;hould be
raz'd out of the Catalogue&mdash;. An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> High-Church-Man
&s;hould not call it Per&s;ecution, becau&s;e, at their Revolu|tion,
it was practi&s;ed by them at Home: A <HI>Scots</HI> Epi&s;copal-Man
&s;hould not, becau&s;e of the ju&s;t Provocation his Party
had given the Poor People to Treat them more Violently.</P>
<P>Again, if, by nice Di&s;tinctions, they &s;hould chance to
&s;ay, they have proved this to be Per&s;ecution&mdash;. What's
this to the Church? It might be done by Presbyte|rians
<HI>of the Church;</HI> but it can never be &s;aid, it was done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y
<HI>THE PRESBYTERIANS as a Church:</HI> It was done by no Act
of the Church, no, nor of the Government; nor did either the
Church or the Government ever Approve, Ju&s;tify, or Employ
any of the Per&s;ons&mdash;. 'Tis true, there was no publick
puni&s;hing the Actors; neither did the Government in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
puni&s;h, neither was it a time to puni&s;h tho&s;e Exce&s;&s;es:
And particularly the Government in <HI>England</HI> thought fit, by
Parliament, &s;o far to bear with them, as to &s;top all Proce&s;s
again&s;t Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There is al&s;o another unhappy Circum&s;tance, that &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">f|fectually
clears the Church of this Charge, that I cannot
<PB N="10" REF="9">
but wonder, the Party could ever make u&s;e of it as an Ar|gument,
or bring this Matter of Rabbling into the Charge:
And that is, That the&s;e Tumults, Plunderings, and Driving
away the Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters, were all done and over,
before there was any &s;uch thing as a Presbyterian Church, I
mean, e&s;tabli&s;h'd, or in any Power to Act as a Judicatory,
or as a Body; So that, to charge the Church with this, is
like Indicting a Man for a Murder committed before he was
born.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore take up none of my time here, to Vindi|cate
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> from any part of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">harge; be|ing
what can, with no colour of Rea&s;on, put the lea&s;t Re|flection
upon her; and if it could, can, by no means, ob|tain
the Name of Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Depo&s;ing the Mini&s;ters</HI>&mdash;. This I think will hardly
come under the Name of Per&s;ecution, nor take up much of my
time&mdash;. What little I &s;hall &s;ay, will be perfectly new to
what has been &s;aid before, <HI>viz.</HI> If this Debate be entered
upon, it will &s;eem to me to depend upon the Original Con|&s;titution
of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Reformation,
and &s;o it will only remain to inquire, whether Epi&s;copacy
in <HI>Scotland</HI> was not an U&s;urpation, and a Per&s;ecution upon
the Rightful E&s;tabli&s;hment: And the Depo&s;ing it only a Re|&s;toring
the Presbyterian Church to its proper undoubted po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion:
And this being a <HI>Point remote to my pre&s;ent Debate,</HI>
I wave it here, not but that I &s;hall readily enter upon that

<P>My Method therefore &s;hall be, to give an Impartial Ac|count
of the general Proceedings of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
in the Matter of E&s;tabli&s;hing the Presbyterian Di&s;cipline, and
Depo&s;ing Epi&s;copacy, together with their Behaviour to the
Epi&s;copal Clergy, thro' the whole Cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent E&s;ta|bli&s;hment;
And tho the whole can be but an Ab&s;tract or
Abridgment, I mean as to Ca&s;es; yet I make no doubt, it

vindicate the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> from all the A&s;per&s;ions

of the Epi&s;copal Di&s;&s;enters &s;ince, being put all into the Ac|count,
the Con&s;equence will &s;how the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> the
mo&s;t Moderate, the farthe&s;t from Per&s;ecution, and the
mo&s;t Forbearing of any E&s;tabli&s;h'd church in the World.</P>
<P>It could not be expected, but that, upon the Revolution,
the Prelatic Tyranny would fall with the Regal; And,
were it worth Examining into, it would be ea&s;y to prove,
there was an Inevitable Nece&s;&s;ity it &s;hould do &s;o, they being
&s;o effectually &s;upported one by another, that they could not

<P>That the conjunct Tyranny of both Church and State had

I &s;hould enter here upon a particular of all that Treatment,
of all the Sufferings and Oppre&s;&s;ions that People underwent;
The exact Hi&s;tory of which, tho it be very much wanted in
the World, yet I cannot think of entring upon it here, un|le&s;s
forced to it, in the ju&s;t Defence of what is but hinted
at in the&s;e Papers.&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed the remote <HI>Idea's</HI> I had of the&s;e things, were &s;uf|ficient

u&s;ed; but I confe&s;s my &s;elf amazed and &s;urprized, when
at my enquiring into Particulars, I find all the Exce&s;&s;es of
Rapine, Violence, Blood, Cruelty, Torture and Barbarity,
that any Age can &s;how for &s;everal hundred years pa&s;t in the
World, till at la&s;t it came to down-right Ma&s;&s;acre; and the
Souldiers had power given them, <HI>and frankly Executed it,</HI> to drag
innocent people in time of full Peace, out of their Hou&s;es,
and murder them at their di&s;cretion; terrible In&s;tances of
which are to be given in &s;everal parts of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>If any man was to read the di&s;mal Stories of that Time,
and making the Ca&s;e his own, reflect upon what he &s;hould have
done in like ca&s;e, when the Revolution put tho&s;e very people,
into the power of &s;uch, who&s;e Blood they had dipt their
Hands in, let him cen&s;ure the enraged people if he can; <HI>in all
their Rabbles,</HI> they only drove their Curats away, and per|haps
plundered &s;ome of them; and was it not rather to be
expected, when gotten together in a Tumultuary way, they
&s;hould have torn them to pieces, and &s;acrificed them <HI>lege talione,</HI>
to the Gho&s;ts of their murdered Relations?</P>
<P>However therefore I avoid entring into the Hi&s;tory of the
Per&s;ecutions and Butcheries, exerci&s;ed by the people we are
&s;peaking of, I cannot help &s;aying here, that they are in their
general View, a mo&s;t direct Te&s;timony of the moderation of
the Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland;</HI> that when E&s;tabli&s;hed, they
contented them&s;elves with a bare Depo&s;ing the thing, with|out
bringing to Ju&s;tice the per&s;ons; among whom many of
the Clergy would have been found Principals, nay, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
even in &s;ome places Actors, in a mo&s;t unu&s;ual and unac|countable
manner.</P>
<P>But to come to particulars, I mean, as to Church Conduct,
let us go back to the Revolution.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops being Depo&s;ed, and the Presbyterian Govern|ment
of the Church being Re&s;tored and E&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
one of the fir&s;t things which the A&s;&s;embly did, was to con|&s;ider
of the planting Mini&s;ters in the Church; and in order
to this it was Debated,</P>
<P>1. Who were the people to be put out. And</P>
<P>2. Who to be put in.</P>
<P>As to the la&s;t, it is no part of the Subject here, nor at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
to the purpo&s;e: But as to the fir&s;t, the Mini&s;ters to be put ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
were of two &s;orts.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
1. Scandalous, Ignorant, and Immoral per&s;ons.</P>
<P>2. Unqualified per&s;ons.</P>
<P>As to the Scandalous and Immoral, I hope no body will
call it Per&s;ecution, that the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> thought it her
Duty to have them removed; and that her A&s;&s;emblies dili|gently
applyed them&s;elves to the Doing it; and yet even in
the doing this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary piece of Ju&s;tice to the Church,
the Lenity, the &s;pace given for Reformation, the pa&s;&s;ing by
a great many, that in &s;trict Ju&s;tice might have been
Depo&s;ed; the&s;e are &s;ufficient Te&s;timonies that it was not a
Spirit of Per&s;ecution, Cruelty, or Severity, which acted the
A&s;&s;emblies, or which acted the Commi&s;&s;ioners deputed by
them, to In&s;pect the Churches at that time; but a nece&s;&s;ary
Ju&s;tice, a Debt due to the Churches Safety, and to the work of
Reformation, and which they could with no tollerable Rea|&s;on,
either in Duty or Polity, have omitted.</P>
<P>If in the Depo&s;ing of Mini&s;ters who appeared Scandalous
or Ignorant, the Party think fit to complain of Inju&s;tice and
Oppre&s;&s;ion, Partiality and Per&s;ecution; and think fit to de|&s;ire
me to Exhibit to the World, a Li&s;t of the Names and
Circum&s;tances of the &s;everal Mini&s;ters Depo&s;ed, and the
Charges again&s;t them; together with the Form how proved,
and how in mo&s;t places confe&s;&s;ed; I am content, and &s;hall
on their fir&s;t notice let the World &s;ee, who, and how many
Mini&s;ters have been Depo&s;ed by the Church, and for what;
&amp; the Article of Per&s;ecution, &s;hall with all my heart turn upon
the Merits of it; but if they would take my Advice, it &s;hould
be to let this be one of the la&s;t things they do, le&s;t it
give the World too plain a Demon&s;tration of the ab&s;olute
Nece&s;&s;ity the church was under to Reform the Mini&s;try, and
tell a little too plainly, what a &s;ort of Clergy they had to
deal with.</P>
<P>The Depo&s;ing Scandalous, Ignorant or Immoral per&s;ons,
therefore I believe will not be called Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>The whole Que&s;tion then mu&s;t depend upon the &s;econd
Head, <HI>viz.</HI> Depo&s;ing Mini&s;ters for not qualifying them&s;elves
according to Law; and tho' this is a direct Act of the State,
and is the &s;ame in <HI>England,</HI> now practi&s;ed by the very &s;ame
High Church-Men that make this complaint; and I could
be very merry with our High-flying Jacobit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Clergy, who
<PB N="14" REF="13">
have Qualified them&s;elves in <HI>England,</HI> and yet retain their
Anti-Revolution-Principles&mdash;yet I wave that Advantage,
and I am content to call it, &s;o far as the Church was the im|mediate
In&s;trument, I &s;ay I am content to call it the Act
and Deed of the Church; becau&s;e giving them all the Lati|tude
in their own way of arguing, <HI>however unfair,</HI> their con|futation
will be with the greater force, and the more Fatal to
them.</P>
<P>The Government was no &s;ooner E&s;tabli&s;ht by the Revolu|tion,
&amp; the Kirk Re&s;tor'd to her Judicatorial Authority, but her
&s;everal Courts, as Se&s;&s;ion, Presbytery, Synod, and A&s;&s;embly
took their cour&s;es, and began to Act.</P>
<P>By the fir&s;t Act of Parliament for &s;ettling the&s;e Matters, pa&s;t
<HI>June</HI> 7. 1690, Intituled, <HI>Act Ratifying the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith,
and Settling Presbyterian Church Government,</HI> It is Ordained,
<HI>That the General A&s;&s;embly the Mini&s;ters and Elders, &s;hould have
Power to try and purge out all In&s;ufficient, Scandalous, and Errone|o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
Mini&s;ters, by due Cour&s;e of Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Proce&s;s and Cen&s;ures;</HI>
But this Act no where Impower'd them to Cen&s;ure any who
were not In&s;ufficient, Scandalous, or Erroneous, tho they
would not take the Oaths to the Government&mdash;. So that,
by this Law, the Church could not be capable of Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>It may be objected here, That to be Epi&s;copal, might be
adjudged Erroneous by this Judicatory, and &s;o come under
the Church Cen&s;ure, by Authority of this Act.</P>
<P>To this 'tis Replyed&mdash;. Fir&s;t, <HI>In Fact,</HI> No Man was ever
&s;ince the Revolution, Depo&s;ed by the Church, meerly for be|ing
Epi&s;copal, nor was any Proce&s;s ever commenc'd again&s;t
any Man on that Foundation.</P>
<P>And here by the way, if this be true, as I can challenge
the World to contradict it, I would humbly recommend it
to tho&s;e Gentlemen, who are now in <HI>England</HI> rai&s;ing Chari|ties,
and obtaining Contributions, pretending it is for the
Relief of the poor Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Epi&s;copal Clergy in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
who are &s;uffering Per&s;ecution, to tell the World, what it is
they are per&s;ecuted for.</P>

or his Vice; for his Religion, or for his Morals; for
Epi&s;copacy, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">or Relap&s;e Fornication.</P>
<P>But, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> To put this out of Que&s;tion, it was parti|cularly
Declared by the Fir&s;t General A&s;&s;embly after the Re|volution,
<HI>viz.</HI> in the Sixth Se&s;&s;ion in the Year 1690, <HI>That

them. Vid. Index</HI> of the Unprinted Acts of the A&s;&s;embly,
<HI>Se&s;&s;.</HI> 6. 1690.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame A&s;&s;embly, in their In&s;tructions given to their
Commi&s;&s;ion, which was to &s;it during their Rece&s;s, we have
the&s;e Words,</P>
<P>That they be very Cautious of receiving Informations again&s;t the

A&s;&s;embly 1690.</HI></P>
<P>Again, le&s;t the Presbyteries &s;hould be Ra&s;h or Severe, the
Commi&s;&s;ion is Impowered as follows, <HI>That if they &s;hall be in|form'd

<P>If then they were thus Moderate even in Scandalous Things,
and Declared again&s;t proceeding in Ca&s;es meerly Epi&s;copal,
where &s;hall we find the Article of Per&s;ecution?</P>
<P>'Tis true, That, in the Year 1693, an Act of Parliament
was made to Deprive all &s;uch Mini&s;ters, as would not both
Swear to the Government, and Acknowledge the Church Go|vernment
al&s;o, and the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith&mdash;. But the
Occa&s;ion of this Act is Vi&s;ible to all that know the Affai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
of that Time&mdash;, that it was pa&s;t to &s;atisfy the Minds
of the People, who were exceedingly Di&s;turb'd&punc; at the
Churches having been In&s;ulted in the A&s;&s;embly 1692,
by a general <HI>Formula</HI> procured by the Epi&s;copal Clergy, toge|ther
with their Appeal to the King on a Refu&s;al: And the
A&s;&s;embly being abruptly Di&s;&s;olved, or Di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <HI>&s;ine die,</HI>
which put the Nation into a very great Fermentation.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
Yet, upon this Act, I may challenge the Epi&s;copal Clergy to
&s;how me one Mini&s;ter, that ever was Depo&s;ed for not acknow|ledging
the Church, if at the &s;ame time he offered to ac|knowledge
the Government, and take the Oaths, and they
have been often challenged on this Head.</P>
<P>And to confirm this Lenity of Practice by a Law, that
Famous Act of Parliament was made in the Year 1695&punc;
wherein taking the Oaths to the Government is made the <HI>One|ly</HI>
and <HI>Fully Sufficient</HI> Qualification, and all Mini&s;ters that
would &s;o <HI>Qualifie them&s;elves</HI> are continued. As may be &s;een
at large by the Act, Intituled, <HI>Act Concerning the Church,
Anno</HI> 1695.</P>
<P>This very Act of Parliament, if I were to go no further,
effectually clears the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> from the charge of
Per&s;ecution; &s;ince 'tis plain there was no religious Tenet in
di&s;pute, but a civil Que&s;tion of owning or not owning the
Government.</P>
<P>It was by this Act of Parliament taken quite out of the
power of the Church, to Depo&s;e any Man meerly for being
Epi&s;copal in principle, or for refu&s;ing to owne the Presbyte|rian
Church; nay the Epi&s;copal Clergy who, by virtue of this
Act, remain in their Livings, many of them to this day, re|fu&s;e
to acknowledge the Church, to &s;ubmit to any of her
Judicatories, or to joyn, either in Di&s;cipline or Wor&s;hip; and
yet in all their Affronts of the E&s;tablish'd Church, they con|tinue
in their Paroches, preaching and u&s;ing all their Forma|lities;
however, contrary to the inclinations and de&s;ires of
the people, who in &s;ome places are fain to &s;et up Meeting-Hou&s;es
in their Paroches, and be at the charge of Entertain|ing
a Presbyterian Mini&s;ter as a Di&s;&s;enter, to preach to them,
becau&s;e they cannot bear the Fopperies and Oppo&s;ition of
their paroch Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>I would fain have tho&s;e people that cry out of the per&s;ecu|tion
of the Epi&s;copal Clergy, go to &s;ome of the&s;e Paroches,
and &s;ee this uncouth Je&s;t, where the per&s;ecuting e&s;tabli&s;h'd
Church is fain to &s;ubmit to a Meeting-hou&s;e, and the per&s;e|cuted
Epi&s;copal Clergy-man in&s;ults them from the pari&s;h-Church,
and keeps both the Pulpit and the Stipend, in &s;pight
of them all.&mdash;Here is the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church turn'd Di&s;|&s;enter,
and the Di&s;&s;enter made the Incumbent; the Per&s;ecutor
<PB N="17" REF="16">
become the per&s;ecuted, and <HI>per contra</HI> the per&s;ecuted made
the per&s;ecutor. But of this more pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The Churches power to per&s;ecute, being thus limited by
Act of Parliament, it remains to Examine, in what manner
&s;he has Exerci&s;ed that Power &s;he had; for in this Article mu&s;t
ly the Matter of this Charge, or they mu&s;t have more than a
&s;pirit of Divination that can find it out.</P>
<P>In order to this, I mu&s;t enquire what this Power they had
was, and that is a very &s;hort Que&s;tion&mdash;Their Power, 'tis
plain, was only again&s;t &s;uch Mini&s;ters who were Scandalous,
&amp;c. as before, or would not take the Oaths to the Govern|ment,
nor pray for King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>Whether they were, or were not ab&s;olutely bound up to
Cen&s;ure all &s;uch as would not thus qualifie them&s;elves, is a
Que&s;tion I &s;hall &s;peak to hereafter.</P>
<P>It follows to Examine how the Church has Executed this
Power; and whether Lenity or Severity has been her Temper
in the ca&s;e; and to &s;tate this, as clearly as po&s;&s;ible, I mu&s;t
make the Gentlemen one fair propo&s;al.</P>
<P>Before I entred upon this Work, I have not only &s;earched
into all the publick Records of this Matter, which I could
have Acce&s;s to, but have made as &s;trict Enquiry, as po&s;&s;ibly
I could, of the mo&s;t Impartial and Unbya&s;s'd Per&s;ons, for
any particular Ca&s;e, wherein any Excur&s;ion might have been
beyond this Power, or wherein the Charge of Per&s;ecution
might ly&mdash;. And having done this with the utmo&s;t Im|partiality,
and not being able to find any thing; and having
not the Honour to be Acquai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ted with any of the Depo&s;ed
Clergy, who might have furni&s;h'd me with &s;ome of the
particulars; I cannot but earne&s;tly intreat &s;ome of the&s;e Re|verend
Gentlemen, who have &s;uffered under the&s;e &s;evere Per|&s;ecutions,
to tell the World what they are, and wherein the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> has, either exceeded her Limited Power,
or indeed fully exerted it in any Ca&s;e, &s;o, as to de&s;erve the
black Charge of Per&s;ecution; A&s;&s;uring them, that if I
could, by all my Search and Inquiry, <HI>tho now upon the Spot,</HI>
have found out but one In&s;tance, in which the Church had
thus per&s;ecuted them, or any of them, I would never
have wrote one Line in her Defence.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">
Perhaps, it may be alledged here, That Impo&s;ing Oaths up|on
the Mini&s;ters, who, <HI>thinking them&s;elves bound by former Oath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
to their late King,</HI> could not in Con&s;cience comply with
them, is Per&s;ecution; e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered, that
this Impo&s;ing the &s;aid Oaths was enforced, on pain of De|privation;
And the Scruples of the&s;e Oaths, in many, who
could otherwi&s;e have complyed, being meerly con&s;cientious, to
deprive them on that Account, is Per&s;ecution in the Ab&s;tract,
being Per&s;ecution purely for Con&s;cience &s;ake.</P>
<P>In An&s;wering this, <HI>which is the mo&s;t material thing can be &s;aid,</HI>
I mu&s;t make &s;everal Remarks.</P>
<P>I. Really Gentlemen, &s;peaking to the Complainers in
the South; tho&s;e of the Clergy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who are per&s;e|cuted
at all, are only per&s;ecuted on this Account: And
therein two things will follow:</P>
<P>1. That all the Di&s;&s;enting Clergy in <HI>Scotland</HI> are <HI>Ja|cobites,</HI>
and &s;uffer only for refu&s;ing to take the Oaths to
the Government.</P>
<P>2. That really the&mdash;<HI>Jacobite</HI> Clergy in the North of
<HI>Britain,</HI> are much Hone&s;ter Men than their Brethren in the
South; &s;ince tho&s;e univer&s;ally have &s;uffered Deprivation
and Lo&s;s of their Livings for their Principle: But, in
the South, Hundreds retaining, <HI>in their Equivocating
Way,</HI> their Loyalty in Principle to their Abdicated King,
have Loaded them&s;elves with Oaths, Abjurations, and
every thing the Government has thought fit to lay upon
them; And yet, on all Occa&s;ions, Act again&s;t that
very Government they Swear to&mdash;Publickly Pray
for King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary;</HI> and now for Queen
<HI>Anne</HI>&mdash;And Privately for King <HI>James,</HI> both Father
and Son: Drink Queen <HI>Ann</HI>'s Health and King <HI>James</HI>
the VIIIth's Alternately, or Occa&s;ionally, as &s;uites their
Company: The&s;e are a &s;ort of Hypocrites equally De|te&s;ted
by both Parties, and equally Dangerous to both.
But of this by the way.</P>
<P>II. If the putting the&s;e Gentlemen out of their Livings
be a Per&s;ecution, then the Church and Government in
<HI>England</HI> have been as guilty of Per&s;ecution, as the Church
and Government in <HI>Scotland;</HI> &s;ince all the Clergy in
one, as well as in the other, were depo&s;ed, and turned
<PB N="19" REF="18">
out, who would not take the Oaths: And the High
Church-Men, who have joyn'd them&s;elves to the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> and con&s;equently made them&s;elves Parties to
that kind of Per&s;ecution, ought, by no means, to call
it &s;o in <HI>Scotland,</HI> unle&s;s they are content to &s;hare the
Scandal.</P>
<P>III. The Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> even under all the Ad|vantages
of Tolleration, are as much per&s;ecuted as the
Epi&s;copal Clergy in <HI>Scotland;</HI> &s;ince not one of their Mi|ni&s;ters
can Preach, (the <HI>Quakers</HI> excepted) without
taking the &s;ame Oaths; And not only &s;o, but &s;igning
the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, a
few &s;mall <HI>Provi&s;o's</HI> for their particular Principles only
excepted.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> All this Per&s;ecution, if it can be called by
that Name, is the Act and Deed of the State; 'Tis a
Debt to the publick Peace, 'tis the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence
of the Revolution, and of the Aboli&s;hing Epi&s;copacy,
things wholly National, Antecedent to the Church
Settlement, and not at all the Act or Concern of the
Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor can it be brought as part of a
Charge again&s;t them.</P>
<P>I come now to Examine, how the Church has Extended
and Exerted the real Power &s;he has, and how far &s;he has pro|ceeded
in the very Execution of the Law; And if I do prove
here, That &s;he has been &s;o far from enforcing the&s;e Laws, or
putting forth her Power in Extremities or Severities, that &s;he
has rather neglected her own Safety, &s;uffered her &s;elf to be
imperfectly &s;ettled, her Power contemned, her Mini&s;ters in|&s;ulted,
her Acts of A&s;&s;embly &s;lighted, and her Di&s;cipline di&s;|regarded&punc;
And this only, becau&s;e &s;he was loth to pu&s;h
things to Extremities, loth to make Examples, loth to u&s;e Se|verities,
and willing, as much as could con&s;i&s;t with Govern|ment
and Safety, to &s;pare, bear with, and deal gently with
tho&s;e, who, in their Power, &s;hew'd her no Favour&punc; and even,
under this Treatment, &s;hew her no manner of Re&s;pect&mdash;, If&punc;
I &s;ay, I prove this, I think I &s;hall effectually clear her of the
Slander, &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread abroad, and &s;o po&s;itively a&s;|&s;erted,
of her being of per&s;ecuting Principles: And if I do
not prove this, I do nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19">
I confe&s;s, this will drive me to the Nece&s;&s;ity of Expo&s;ing
&s;ome of the Names of the&s;e Gentlemen, who, by this Con|nivance
and Lenity of the Church, peaceably enjoy, <HI>tho I
cannot &s;ay they gratefully acknowledge it,</HI> tho&s;e Benefices and Liv|ings
which they had, by their other Circum&s;tance, Forfeited
to the Laws; But the nece&s;&s;ary Defence of Truth obliging
me to it, tho&s;e Gentlemen mu&s;t blame their Friends, who
have made this unhappy Nece&s;&s;ity, not me, who, I a&s;&s;ure
them, have no per&s;onal Grudge either at them, or at the
Connivance granted them, and only wi&s;h they would, in a
more peaceable and re&s;pectful manner, enjoy it.</P>
<P>The Li&s;t of Names contains two Ranks or &s;orts of People,
and either of them are Te&s;timonies of the publick Moderati|on,
one of the Government, and one of the Church in par|ticular;
and both of them will &s;erve to make the Complaint
of Per&s;ecution and Severities look very odly.</P>
<P>The Li&s;ts are twofold, and not to interrupt the Thread of
Di&s;cour&s;e, I have plac'd one of them by way of <HI>Appendix</HI> at the
end of this Book; I have forborn abundance of Reflections, and
ju&s;t Remarks on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ircum&s;tances, and particular Conduct
of the Gentlemen named there: Not that I am ignorant of the
particulars, and &s;hall, at any time gratify them with nece&s;&s;a|ry
Comments upon them, if they de&s;ire it&mdash;, But to let
them &s;ee, that even, in this Account, I forbear to expo&s;e
them farther, than the nece&s;&s;ary Defence of the Ca&s;e before
me calls for; and I am very &s;orry they have done any thing
to bring this upon them.</P>
<P>By the fir&s;t Li&s;t which I have not printed, but in the pub|lick
Regi&s;ters any one may &s;ee it, it will appear, that there
are now Preaching, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their re&s;pective Pari&s;h
Churches, above three&s;core Mini&s;ters, who were profe&s;tly
and openly Epi&s;copal; but, on their &s;ubmitting to, and ac|knowledging
the Presbyterian E&s;tabli&s;hment, were received
to Mini&s;terial Communion, and many of them are now
worthy Members of the pre&s;ent Church; by which one
thing will be unan&s;werably proved.</P>
<P><HI>viz.</HI> That not one Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ter, in the whole
Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> has been Depo&s;ed for his Prin|ciple;
That is, not for his being Epi&s;copal, or for his
Non-conformity to the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Presbyterian Church,
but meerly for <HI>Jacobiti&s;m,</HI> for his refu&s;ing to own
<PB N="21" REF="20">
the Government, and acknowledge the Queen; &s;ince,
would he have taken the Oaths, and prayed for the
Sovereign, it was not in the Power of the General <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;|&s;embly,
which is the Repre&s;entative of the Church,
to depo&s;e or per&s;ecute them at all.</P>
<P>I know this will be a &s;urprizing thing to abundance of
Hone&s;t People in <HI>England,</HI> who hitherto have had other No|tions;
and I cannot but de&s;ire them to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>1. How impo&s;&s;ible it is to be true, that the Church
of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould per&s;ecute the Epi&s;copal Clergy for
their Non-conformity, when, by Act of Parliament, it
was not in their Power to mole&s;t or depo&s;e any Mini|&s;ter,
however Epi&s;copal in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rinciple or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ractice, if
he would but take the Oaths to the Government, and
pray for the King or Queen; and when it was in their
Power, they reponed all tho&s;e that would come in.</P>
<P>2. This clears the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ivil Government al&s;o, from be|ing
any way cruel, &s;evere, or per&s;ecuting to the Epi&s;|copal
Clergy; &s;ince all they required, was only Con|formity
to the Civil Magi&s;trate, and Complying with
the Laws of the Land&mdash;. And in this Ca&s;e, it
would be worth notice al&s;o, how different the Terms of
this Conformity were in this Government, from the like
Terms of Conformity in the Times of Epi&s;copal Go|vernment
&mdash;. In this the Penalty of Refu&s;ing was
only Deprivation of their Benefices in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lergy, and
in the Laity nothing at all; in tho&s;e Days, Bani&s;h|ment,
Impri&s;onment, and Death at the Mercy of eve|ry
Soldier, was the Lot not of the Clergy only, but of
every Per&s;on, and many have been murdered in cold
Blood, without Mercy, for refu&s;ing not only to &s;wear
to the King, but only for refu&s;ing to &s;ay, <HI>GOD Save
the King.</HI></P>
<P>I know the poor People are branded here with Weakne&s;s
and Ob&s;tinacy&mdash;. But two things &s;eem to be a pre&s;ent
An&s;wer to that,</P>
<P>1. The&s;e were but a few, and tho&s;e of the meane&s;t
and weake&s;t of the People.</P>
<P>2. The weaker the People, the more cruel and bar|barous
the Severity of tho&s;e times, that &s;hould put them
to Death for &s;uch Trifles, taking them by the Handle
of their mi&s;taken Nicety.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">
3. It is evident, it was only taking Advantage of
the Zeal of a People, which run beyond the Bounds of
Rea&s;on&mdash;. Since, if they had not had that Handle,
they would have &s;ought &s;ome other: And it was plain,
that where they found the People complying with tho&s;e
Demands, they '&s;cap'd not the better, but they always
found Pretences to murder them.</P>
<P>4. The poor People are not &s;o much to be blam'd,
&s;ince they under&s;tood, <HI>GOD Save the King,</HI> was, to
pray GOD to pro&s;per the King in the Per&s;ecution of
their Brethren.</P>
<P>'Tis farther confirm'd, That the Civil Government
has not per&s;ecuted, or been cruel or &s;evere to the&s;e
Gentlemen; &s;ince not only they continued all the
Mini&s;ters, that would give but the Security of their
Oaths for their peaceable Behaviour, a thing no Govern|ment
in the World would di&s;pen&s;e with: <HI>But, &s;ince
that,</HI> the Treatment of tho&s;e that have been Depo&s;ed has
been &s;uch, &s;o Gentle, &s;o Tender, and &s;o Forbearing,
as I believe, all Circum&s;tances con&s;idered, no Nation in
the World can parallel; Of which, and their Beha|viour
to the Government, under that Lenity, I may
&s;peak by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>And I cannot but recommend the Gentlemen, Who are
Complainers here, to Her Maje&s;ties An&s;wer to the Depo&s;|ed
clergy, who Addre&s;&s;ed, in the Beginning of Her Reign,
for their Liberty, <HI>viz.</HI> To behave them&s;elves peaceably, and
&s;ubject them&s;elves to the Government; Which, however
&s;ome of them were willing to con&s;true as a Declaration of
Liberty, and to u&s;e it in a different way from Her Maje&s;ties
Intention, they might have found more Rea&s;on, had they
Judged Impartially, to have taken for a Reproof of their un|peaceable
Behaviour, and ungrateful Temper to the Govern|ment,
which had &s;o Gently Treated them.</P>
<P>Again I ob&s;erve, as this effectually clears the
Government of <HI>Scotland</HI> from the Charge of Per&s;ecu|tion;
So <HI>the Second Li&s;t</HI> will, with much more Rea|&s;on,
and no doubt, to the A&s;toni&s;hment of a great part of
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, who &s;hall read it, abundantly clear up
the Reputation of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the Horrid
<PB N="23" REF="22">
Slander of Per&s;ecution&punc; being an Account of 165 Epi&s;copal
Mini&s;ters, mu&s;t of whom have neither complyed with the
Church nor with the Government; have neither &s;ubmitted to
the Presbyterian E&s;tabli&s;hment in Di&s;cipline or Church Go|vernment,
nor qualified them&s;elves as by Act of Parliament
is required, that owne neither Civil Government nor Eccle|&s;ia&s;tick;
that neither pray for the Queen, nor Swear to the
Queen, nor acknowledge either Queen or Church; and yet
by the meer forbearance of the Church, are now peaceably
enjoying their Benefices, Stipends, and Appurtenances,
preach publickly to the people, and live in the open profe&s;&s;ion
of the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite Principles to the E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>Would any Man that knew all this, have the face to &s;ay,
this is a Per&s;ecuting Church? would any Church in the World
that had a legal and National E&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;uffer, in de|fyance
of her Authority, and in contempt of her E&s;tabli&s;h|ment,
what this Church &s;uffers, and what in meer back|wardne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
to per&s;ecution &s;he bears with?</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be ask'd here, What is it &s;he bears
with? and I know great Noi&s;e is made, that the Episcopal
people here are not &s;o different as in <HI>England</HI> from the Pre&s;|byterians,
having no Service-Book, Habits, or Ceremonies;
and therefore the things they bear with are but Trifles, and
the Moderation the le&s;s to be in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>But this is not &s;o ea&s;ie to make good as to &s;ay, for 'tis not
the meer Articles of Ceremony &amp; Habits that make the wei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ht
of the Difference in <HI>England,</HI> any more than here; and if the
Difference is but a Trifle, the Argument is &s;tronger again&s;t
tho&s;e who for Trifles divide from the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church,
than again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church who expect their Confor|mity.</P>
<P>But 'tis evident, let the differences in Religion be what
they will, the difference here lyes chiefly in Civil Matters&punc; all
their Qualifications depending upon Swearing to the Go|vernment;

that they, <HI>I mean generally &s;peaking,</HI> in all, or mo&s;t part of the

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They pray not for the Queen, &amp;c.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They refu&s;e to &s;ign the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They &s;ubmit not to Church Cen&s;ures, or acknow|ledge
Church Judicatories.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They refu&s;e to Lecture or Expound before Sermon,
which all other Mini&s;ters are obliged to, <HI>by an Act of A&s;|&s;embly,</HI>
every Morning.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. They keep no Se&s;&s;ion, but the Presbytery are obliged
to appoint others to do it, to pre&s;erve Ju&s;tice and Order in
the Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. They Ordain no Elders.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. They Examine not their Communicants before the Sa|crament,
as all other Mini&s;ters do, and are obliged to do.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I do not &s;ay every one of them are guilty of all the&s;e Omi&s;|&s;ions&mdash;.
But all are guilty of &s;ome of them; &s;ome of all of
them; and others of more than the&s;e&mdash;. And to this may
be added, that they are univer&s;ally declar'd Jacobites, and
profe&s;&s;ed Enemies to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>

I might here give a Li&s;t of Mini&s;ters, who having been De|po&s;ed
or &s;u&s;pended by re&s;pective Presbyteries, or by Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
appointed to In&s;pect, have yet, by the Tender|ne&s;s

been reponed, and placed in their Livings again, only

re-a&s;&s;umed their little Formalities, and profe&s;s'd them&s;elves
openly Epi&s;copal, and yet the Church has taken no Advan|tage
again&s;t them.</P>
<P>I might, as I hinted before, give a Li&s;t of Mini&s;ters, who&s;e
open Omi&s;&s;ion of Di&s;cipline, Lecturing, and all manner of
Church Order, together with their Slackne&s;s, Meanne&s;s, and
Formalities in their Performances, are &s;o perfectly di&s;agree|able
to their People, that they are obliged to get Presbyte|rian
Mini&s;ters to preach in Meeting-Hou&s;es like Di&s;&s;enters
among them, and yet the Church bears with all this, rather
than per&s;ecute them&mdash;. But I omit the&s;e things, till I am
farther nece&s;&s;itated to expo&s;e them; but they that que&s;tion
the Fact may inquire about Mr. <HI>Patrick Lyon</HI> at <HI>Kinghorn,</HI> and

<P>I come now to the Treatment tho&s;e really called Di&s;&s;enters,
tho&s;e who are actually Depo&s;ed meet with from the Church,
and this will almo&s;t force me to enter a little into a long and
black Account of the Treatment the Church meets with from
them, in which I &s;hall however be very tender, being unwil|ling
to expo&s;e any Bodies Frailties more than meer nece&s;&s;ity

<P>I doubt not, but if I &s;hould &s;ay, that the&s;e Di&s;&s;enting,
Epi&s;copal Mini&s;ters, who are thus Depo&s;ed, do, now and
then, take the Liberty very privately to preach, it would,
with &s;ome Wonder, and more Difficulty, be believed in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
where the general Opinion is, <HI>&s;o &s;trangely have People
been Impo&s;ed upon,</HI> that they are intirely &s;uppre&s;t, that they

<P>But how will the&s;e People behave them&s;elves? How will
ye be amaz'd to think in what manner you have been im|po&s;ed
upon? And how ea&s;ily you have &s;uffered your

the Epi&s;copal Party in <HI>Scotland</HI> enjoy at this time, and have
done for &s;everal Years, all the Liberty which the Di&s;&s;enters
in <HI>England</HI> do now enjoy, and that with Conditions va&s;tly
differing.</P>
<P>I<HI>&s;t,</HI> They have their full Liberty by the meer Leni|ty
and Forbearance of the Government, which in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
could never be obtained but in little Intervals, but
by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>2. They have the &s;ame Liberty, tho they not only re|fu&s;e
to take the Oaths, but refu&s;e to &s;ign the Doctrinal
Articles of the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, tho even the Church
of <HI>England</HI> owns them to be all Orthodox, a thing the
Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> are not permitted in, no not by
the Act of Tolleration.</P>
<P>3. They enjoy this Liberty, notwith&s;tanding they
openly, and in their publick A&s;&s;emblies, not only o|mit
praying for the Queen, but &s;ome of them actually
and di&s;tinctly pray for their <HI>James</HI> the VIII, and for his
Re&s;toration, which is not only praying for a Popi&s;h
Prince, but praying GOD to depo&s;e or cut off Her pre|&s;ent
Maje&s;ty, and Affront &s;o horridly Impious, and &s;o
Offen&s;ive to all Her Maje&s;ties Subjects, that one
would wonder the mo&s;t Moderate Principle in the

<P>And what will you &s;ay now Gentlemen of the High Church
in <HI>England?</HI> When I &s;hall tell you, there are now fourteen or
&s;ixteen of the&s;e Meeting-Hou&s;es in the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> ju&s;t
in the Face of the General A&s;&s;embly of the Church, and in the
Eyes of the Government, and that in any Town or place in the
Kingdom, where they have Hearers, they have the &s;ame&mdash;.
That in &s;ome of the&s;e, they have newly &s;et up the Com|mon
Prayer Book, a thing in the Heighth of Epi&s;copacy they
never attempted, and which even the Epi&s;copal Party in ge|neral
<PB N="27" REF="26">
were never reconciled to&mdash;. And that, in not one
of the&s;e Meetings, that ever I heard of, the Queen is pray'd
for by Name, but in &s;ome directly they pray for the King,
which mu&s;t mean their <HI>James</HI> the VIII, or wor&s;e, and in
others they pray in ambiguous Words, &s;uch as <HI>THE QUEEN,</HI>
or the <HI>ROYAL FAMILY,</HI> and if I am not mi&s;informed, in
&s;ome for King <HI>James</HI> the eighth in &s;o many Words.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that in the&s;e open In&s;ults both of Government

Oppo&s;itions from the people who have been provoked at
&s;uch Indignities done to their Sovereign, and to the Go|vernment
in the face of the Sun; and the&s;e little Rabbles
they would call Per&s;ecution&mdash;and yet even in the&s;e ca&s;es
the Government has carefully &s;uppre&s;t the Tumult, and
voluntarly made Reparation to private Families, for the
Damnages they have pretended to have &s;u&s;tained, and that
often beyond the real Spoil, tho' at the &s;ame time their own
Imprudent and provoking Carriage has been the principal
Occa&s;ion of the&s;e Damnages; and this is evident in the City
of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> in particular, the only time they can talk of, where
the Rabble a&s;&s;aulting a <HI>Jacobite</HI> Conventicle, or Epi&s;copal Meet|ing,
<HI>For there is very little difference between them at any time,

of the Hou&s;e &s;everal hundred pounds <HI>&s;terling,</HI> for the &s;up|po&s;ed
Damnage he received; <HI>Which in all appearance &s;o far
exceeded his Lo&s;s,</HI> that 'tis no breach of Charity to believe, he

put out for not taking the Oaths, are per&s;ecuted, and pro|&s;ecuted
for the private Exerci&s;e of their Function as Mini|&s;ters,

<P>I am &s;orry to be driven to the Nece&s;&s;ity of telling &s;uch un|happy

Gentlemen, be not afraid of the Mi&s;chiefs of Tolleration; if
the Epi&s;copal Clergy, or any Body for them, complain, if
they de&s;ire a Tolleration, tell them, <HI>with all your Hearts,</HI> on
the &s;ame Terms the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> have it, they &s;hall
have it when they plea&s;e: And &s;ince the Tolleration of Di&s;|&s;enters
in <HI>England</HI> is made the great Argument for Tollerati|on
here, they cannot have the Face to de&s;ire better Conditi|ons,

fear not the Con&s;equences, either they will accept it <HI>thus,</HI> or
they will not.</P>

De&s;truction of their Party, and the Aboli&s;hing the very
Name of Di&s;&s;enting in <HI>Scotland, as before.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If they will not accept it,</HI> you are for ever clear, either of the
Reproach of having denyed it to them, or of the Slander &s;o
much Noi&s;e has been made of, I mean <HI>Per&s;ecution.</HI></P>
<P>But I cannot omit one <HI>Note</HI> here, and that turns the Ar|gument
to a Third Party, <HI>viz.</HI> The Civil Magi&s;trate, and
here I &s;hall leave it only by way of Interrogation, and let
who will An&s;wer the Que&s;tion, I &s;hall wait to &s;ee it Debat|ed,

<P><HI>Are you &s;ure the Tolleration de&s;ir'd is con&s;i&s;tent with the Treaty

Treaty</HI>&mdash;? And as this merits very well to be enquir'd in|to
on both &s;ides, &s;o give me leave to &s;ay, <HI>if it does,</HI> no Power

The Words of the Act for S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">curing the Presbyt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rian Church

a Tolleration of Wor&s;hip, <HI>The Government of the Church of</HI>
Scotland <HI>continues without any Alteration.</HI></P>
<P>I do not make an Exception for the Gift and Con&s;ent of
the Church here, as if that could Qualify &s;uch a Law&mdash;For
even the Grant and Con&s;ent of the Church could not now
make it Lawful; the Church cannot now give away her own
Rights, they are a Debt to Po&s;terity, and &s;he is bound equal|ly
with the Government, <HI>in all Succeeding Generations,</HI> by the
Obligations of the Union.</P>
<P>But I grant the Church may, by their Moderation, Cha|rity
and Tenderne&s;s, &s;uffer and permit the Epi&s;copal Di&s;&s;en|ters
to Exerci&s;e their &s;eparate way of Wor&s;hip, without Exert|ing
their Power of Government to their Di&s;turbance, and
this I hope they will continue to do: And this leads me
naturally to two things, by way of Caution, to the Gentle|men
on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>1. This Lenity and Moderation is already practi&s;ed
to you, and the Church does bear with you, even to
Exce&s;s, <HI>if that Word</HI> be &s;uitable to Moderation, and it
cannot be grateful in you, to pu&s;h your Complaints
to &s;uch Extremities, and to force the Friends of the
Church to defend them&s;elves and her, by &s;tating the
Ca&s;e fairly in the Sight of the World; Since, in tho&s;e
Defences, &s;ome things mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily appear to your
Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">
2. It cannot but move you to behave &s;o, as to me|rit
the Continuance of that Moderation; For if it be
only in the Power of the Church, to make you ea&s;y,
as I believe will appear at la&s;t, you may de&s;pi&s;e it as
much as you plea&s;e, but your only prudent way is to
de&s;erve it, by a Mode&s;t, Peaceable, and Chri&s;tian Be|haviour;
and when you have tryed all other ways,
perhaps you may be the better convinc'd of the Sea&s;o|nablene&s;s
of &s;uch Advice, and this I leave to time to
open your Eyes in.</P>

<P><PB N="39" REF="38">
This is the Li&s;t mentioned in <HI>Page 23d.</HI> of this Tract, many
of whom, to this day, behave them&s;elves to the E&s;tabli&s;h'd
Church, much wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e than the profe&s;t <HI>Jacobites</HI> and Non-ju|rant
Di&s;&s;enters, in&s;ulting the Church Judicatories, and bid|ding
Defiance to their Authority&mdash;. Behaving them|&s;elves
with all manner of Rudene&s;s and Indecency.</P>
<P>Intruding into Churches without the Call of the People,
or any Legal Proceeding, and keeping Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t the
direct Authority of the Church, in Defiance of the re&s;pective
Presbyteries, and contrary to the Laws of the Land.</P>
<P>The&s;e indeed are things which de&s;erve a farther Di&s;covery
to the World, and may in time have it done to their Satis|faction;
But, mean time, the Matter of Fact is &s;ufficient
to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and the Inquiry into particulars may
remain to another Occa&s;ion.&mdash;</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>I Cannot conclude this Affair, without nothing &s;omething
to the &s;everal Parties.</P>
<P>1. To the Epi&s;copal Di&s;&s;enters, I do not &s;ay nor &s;ugge&s;t,
that there are none of them, who are Religious, Con&s;cienti|ous
Di&s;&s;enters, and Di&s;&s;ent meerly on Account of Con&s;ci|ence;
tho I believe &s;uch are very few&mdash;. But to &s;uch, I &s;ay,
the Church is, <HI>and I would be &s;orry they were not,</HI> as Tender as
po&s;&s;ible; They do not exclude them from even Mini&s;terial
Communion, if they plea&s;e to accept it; Nor do they ex|clude
the Lay Di&s;&s;enters from any Church Privileges, or
impo&s;e any Terms of Communion upon them.</P>
<P>2. To the Depo&s;ed Clergy, I would put them in Mind
to examine, whether the Clergy of the pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hurch have
not behaved to them, with Humanity and Charity in their
private Capacities, as well as in their publick; Whether
they have not rai&s;ed large Contributions among them, of
meer Tenderne&s;s to their Circum&s;tances, and given them
con&s;iderable Sums for their Relief; Whether they have not
endeavoured to recover the Funds formerly rai&s;ed, called the
<PB N="40" REF="39">
<HI>Cente&s;ima,</HI> being a Provi&s;ion for the Widows and Orphans
of the Clergy, and ordered it to be &s;et apart for the Widows
and Orphans of the Epi&s;copal Clergy only; And whether
they do not continue dayly to relieve the Di&s;&s;enting Epi&s;|copal
Clergy by Collections, and giving them&s;elves largely
to their Supply.</P>
<P>3. To tho&s;e who may be forward to object, that I &s;eem
to Invade the Churches Intrin&s;ic Power, in &s;aying, &s;he had
her Power to Act in an E&s;tabli&s;h'd Method from an Act of
Parliament, <HI>P.</HI> To the&s;e I &s;ay, if they plea&s;e to
compare it with other places of this Book, they will find no
Room for that Thought; Nor am I concerned to enter here
into that Debate, I take the Act in the Sen&s;e the Church ac|cepted
it, <HI>viz,</HI> A Civil Sanction to their Power, which, if
it did not add to their Real Power, might however add
to the Publick Regard pay'd to that Power.</P>
<P>4. To the&s;e who object, that I here acknowlege the
Church has not done her Duty, and that if &s;he had not per|&s;ecuted,
&s;he ought to have done it, I leave them to con&s;i|der
again a Declaration of the Church of <HI>England</HI> lately
made at the Head of the Occa&s;ional Bill, <HI>viz.</HI> That Per&s;e|cution
for Con&s;cience is incon&s;i&s;tent with, and contrary to
the Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> As to the Li&s;t above-mentioned, I do not po&s;i|tively
&s;ay, none of the Per&s;ons there named, have never
taken the Oaths, tho I am told they have not, no not one&punc;
But that they are all openly and declaredly Epi&s;copal, I be|lieve
no Man will Debate with me.</P>
<P>I however make the&s;e Cautionary Hints, becau&s;e I know
I am to expect all the Cavil Angry Men can rai&s;e at this
Book, which neverthele&s;s I hope, tho in my ab&s;ence it may
have no Defender, will &s;tand upon its own Foundation
of Truth in Fact, and I am &s;ure has been wrote with al
po&s;&s;ible Caution as to per&s;onal Wrong.&mdash;</P>
