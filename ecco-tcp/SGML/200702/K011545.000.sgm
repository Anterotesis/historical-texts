<HEAD>THE PREFACE To Mr. <HI>POPE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Am &s;o little inclin'd to trouble even Men of Merit, with the Addre&s;s of &s;uch Trifles as The&s;e, that it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hou'd &s;o much as have thought of Your&s;elf with that View, if Hone&s;t <HI>Bernard,</HI> your Book&s;eller, had not inform'd me, That You (I &s;uppo&s;e it was out of the Fulne&s;s of your known Zeal for our Church and Con&s;titution) had taken upon you to a&s;&s;ert, that Printing any thing in Prai&s;e of the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> wou'd be receiv'd as a Satyr on the Government.</P>
<P>'Tis po&s;&s;ible, that under this Di&s;gui&s;e of Opinion, Your Exce&s;s of Good-breeding may have conceal'd your Di&s;like of the Performance; for I find it a Difficulty to conceive, how &s;o whim&s;ical an Objection cou'd come into a Head, &s;o well &s;tor'd with Judgment, as we are to conclude Yours to be, from Your <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>Let either of the&s;e &s;age Ca&s;es be the Right, I con&s;ider their Importance as Equal; and take this Occa&s;ion, with a Frankne&s;s, like Your own, to a&s;&s;ure You, that my E&s;teem for Your <HI>Genius</HI> as a Poet, is &s;o very con&s;iderable, that it is hardly exceeded by my Con|tempt of Your Vanity.</P>
<P>What led me to embrace an Opportunity of knowing Your Opinion, was a Di&s;po&s;ition which two Lines in Your <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> above-mention'd &s;hall explain for me;</P>
<L>Tru&s;t not Your-&s;elf; but Your Defects to know,</L>
<L>Make U&s;e of Ev'ry Friend:&mdash;And Ev'ry Foe:</L>
<P>I cou'd not, I confe&s;s, con&s;ider you as a <HI>Friend,</HI> having that very great Misfortune to langui&s;h under, of not being reckon'd in the Number of Your Acquaintance: But in the <HI>La&s;t</HI> of the two Lights, I pre&s;um'd, I might regard You, &s;ince Mr. <HI>Dennis,</HI> for who&s;e Skill in Judging I profe&s;s an E&s;teem, has a&s;&s;ured us, that You are a Kind of <HI>Foe</HI> to e|very Body but Your-&s;elf, and on that Foundation, &s;upports his rough Attempt <HI>to pull the Lyon's Skin from a certain little A&s;s</HI> he there mentions, and I fear he means You, Sir.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider'd You in this Character, I made no doubt but any Poem wou'd have had the Good Fortune to come out of Your Hands well examined, that I &s;hou'd have heard of <HI>Rough Ver&s;e,</HI> improper <HI>Sentiments,</HI> and a World of <HI>Poetical</HI> Errors: But I profe&s;s Your Penetration over-&s;hot all my Fears, and I cannot find Words to expre&s;s my A&s;toni&s;h|ment at Your Capacity, when Mr. <HI>Lintott</HI> li&s;p'd out, That Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;aid, <HI>there were &s;everal good Things in the</HI> Northern-Star, <HI>BUT, it would be taken for an In&s;ult on the Government: FOR, tho' the</HI> Czar <HI>is King</HI> George <HI>'s Ally; yet we are like|ly to quarrel with</HI> Sweden; <HI>and</HI> Mu&s;covy, whi&s;per'd Bernard, <HI>lies, he &s;ays, in the North!</HI></P>
<P>If this plea&s;ant Di&s;covery was Your Real Opinion, we mu&s;t, I'm a&s;raid, learn to <HI>pity</HI> the Weakne&s;s of a Judgment, which, I know, is Heroic enough to wi&s;h rather for <HI>Envy, tho' a &s;turdier Pa&s;&s;ion, and agree with You heartily, that,</HI></P>
<L><HI>A</HI> Little Learning <HI>is a dangerous Thing.</HI></L>
<P>But if you di&s;lik'd the Poem, as a Poem, why did you not fairly avow the Di&s;reli&s;h? I could have own'd a Conviction of Error, with the &s;ame Satisfaction, I feel, when I repay a Civility. Shall I put you in Mind, that Di&s;like not own'd openly, &s;tands condemn'd by a Judge, who&s;e Sentence Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> of all Mankind, will be the la&s;t to appeal from,</P>
<L>Be Niggards of Advice, on no Pretence,</L>
<L>For the wor&s;t Avarice is that of Sen&s;e:</L>
<L>With mean Complacence ne'er betray your Tru&s;t,</L>
<L>Nor be &s;o civil, as to prove unju&s;t:</L>
<P>Pope <HI>'s E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t, by no Means, imagine, that a &s;upercilious Re&s;ult, from Neglect of examining into the Merits of a Cau&s;e, he pretends to decide, can he charg'd with any Ju&s;tice on the Au|thor of the following Lines, unle&s;s he was religious enough to write them, with De&s;ign to la&s;h him&s;elf by Way of Penance.</P>
<L><HI>Of all the Cau&s;es, which con&s;pire to blind</HI></L>
<L><HI>Man's Erring Judgment, and mi&s;guide the Mind;</HI></L>
<L><HI>What the weak Head, with &s;tronge&s;t Bya&s;s, rules,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is,</HI> Pride, <HI>the neverfailing Vice of Fools.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whatever Nature has, in Worth, deny'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>She gives. in large Recruits, of needful Pride:</HI></L>
<P>In &s;hort, if I writ Ver&s;e often enough to make my Vanity Rampant; I &s;hould &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect, that you were mightily taken with this Poem, &s;ince you thought it worth your while
<PB REF="3">
to give it an ill Char&agrave;cter; for You&punc; who rever iie, have told the World, and I &s;uppo&s;e you a&s;&s;ert Nothing but from Your own Knowledge,</P>
<L>That &s;till the Wor&s;t with mo&s;t Regret, Commend,</L>
<L>And each bad Writer is as bad a Friend.</L>
<L>And while Self-Love each jealous Writer rules,</L>
<L>Contending Wits become the Sport of Fools:</L>
<P>But. if I was not afraid, that You wou'd think me Ill-natur'd, I wou'd ob&s;erve in your Favour, on this Occa&s;ion, that tho' all the&s;e foregoing Ver&s;es are Your own Words, they way po&s;ibly be very different from Your Sentiments; for I remember, that, among the re&s;t, You, tell us, by Way of Warning.</P>
<P><HI>That Men of Wit may their own Rules invade,</HI></P>
<P><HI>As Kings di&s;pen&s;e with Laws, them&s;elves have made.</HI></P>
<P>I will therefore take Advantage, from my having been pretty conver&s;ant with your Writings, to &s;eek a better Rea&s;on yet, for the Oddne&s;s of your Notion, that this <HI>North|ern-Star</HI> is a Satyr on the <HI>Government.</HI> Your abovemention'd Cabinet of Sentences is &s;o well furni&s;hed, that, like a Ma&s;querade-&s;hop at <HI>Venice.</HI> it will give a Man what Face he plea&s;es in a Twinkling; but I pre&s;ume, I have hit the Right Nail, when I &s;top at the fol|lowing <HI>Simile.</HI></P>
<L>All &s;eems infected, that th' infected Spy,</L>
<L>As all looks Yellow to the Jaundic'd Eve:</L>
<P>But however, tho&punc; as <HI>Teague</HI> in the Comedy, finds his Mouth run from one Side to the other, and cannot for his Life &s;ay <HI>Lady&s;hip</HI> to Mrs. <HI>Day,</HI> without laughing in her Face, I cannot without much Difficulty grow Grave, when I compare the Judge with the Sen|tence; yet to allow all po&s;&s;ible fair Quarter, let us &s;uppo&s;e, that the <HI>Czar,</HI> as He is not; were now actually our Enemy&mdash;Are his Merits le&s;s &s;hining? Does His Glory depend on His Friend&s;hip for <HI>Britain?</HI> Contemptible Meanne&s;s of Thought! Is it nece&s;&s;ary to|wards becoming a <HI>Patriot,</HI> among the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that every Thing mu&s;t be hated, that is&punc; <HI>Foreign?</HI> At that Rate the <HI>toto divi&s;os orbe Britannos</HI> wou'd be more applicable to our Humour than it is to our Sitvation.</P>
<P>Next to de&s;erving well our&s;elves, it is the noble&s;t Perfection of Nature, to admire and applaud tho&s;e, who do &s;o; But to have no Ear open to Renown at a Di&s;tance, were ba&s;e, vain and brutal, equally di&s;ta&s;teful to Humanity and Wi&s;dom. We may talk what we plea&s;e of our <HI>Natural Advantages.</HI> There is one <HI>Natural Defect,</HI> which will &s;ha|dow them All; and which makes it impo&s;&s;ible to widen our Power, till we enlarge our Conceptions.</P>
<P>I am apt to believe that Nothing has contributed more to this Narrowne&s;s of Mind, than the Flatteries of our Poets: who generally writing for a precarious Sub&s;i&s;tance, can no Way &s;o ea&s;ily &s;ucceed, as by falling in with the Weakne&s;s and Bya&s;s of Mens Natures; and hence all our Women are Nymphs, Angels, or Godde&s;&s;es; our Men, Demi-Hero's; all our Soldiers are invincible; all our Generals beyond <HI>Cae&s;ar;</HI> all our Kings like <HI>Augu&s;|tus;</HI> and every Lord who has a Penny in his Pocket, and a Crotchet in His Imagination, a very <HI>Mecaenas.</HI></P>
<P>A Poet &s;hou'd &s;ometimes &s;tand high, and look wide for a Subject; If He is always Do|me&s;tic, He will be often unnatural. <HI>Virgil's</HI> celebrated Prai&s;e of his <HI>Italy,</HI> had been Fal&s;hood and F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">attery, apply'd to <HI>Great Britain.</HI> He knew and admired the Delights of His Country, and acted as became Him, when he ju&s;tly commended them. But our High|way-Poets, who&s;e utmo&s;t Reach of Skill is a <HI>Poor Imitation,</HI> forget that they make <HI>Them|&s;elves</HI> contemptible&punc; in&s;tead of ornamenting their Subject, when Peace in <HI>our</HI> Climate is dre&s;s'd in her <HI>Olives;</HI> when <HI>Pan</HI> fills our Woods, and <HI>Tritons</HI> our Seas; and our Shep|herds <HI>&s;it Piping,</HI> like the Swains of <HI>Arcadia.</HI></P>
<P>A meer Poet, that is to &s;ay, a Wretch, who has nothing but the Jingle in his Brain to ring Chimes to his Vanity, and who&s;e whole Trade is Rhyme-jobbirg; &s;uch a Creature is certainly the mo&s;t worthle&s;s Incumbrance of his Country. His Arrogance is the only Thing more Remarkable than his Ignorance. The fanta&s;tical Merit that &s;wells him, is, like o|ther Ill-Humors&punc; the more noxious for its Thinne&s;s. U&s;eful Science is an Air much too Gro&s;s for His Intellects: Biting Scorn, and Univer&s;al Neglect turn their Points on His Conceitedne&s;s, and while the whole World &s;trives in vain to correct him by Di&s;grace and Reproaches, All that Tempe&s;t to Him is no more, than Blowing Wind in a Bladder, the &s;tronger the Puff, the more boi&s;terous the Swelling.</P>
<P>All this, Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> mu&s;t reeds know, between his double Capacity, of <HI>Poet</HI> and <HI>Critic;</HI> and, if &s;o, He has given a Judgment, as well corrupt, as ridiculous, in attributing to <HI>Party</HI> the Endeavours of <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI> But if after all, it was not the <HI>Subject,</HI> but the <HI>Poem,</HI> that found no Favour in His Eyes, I will take upon me to a&s;&s;ure Him, it &s;ues not for the Ble&s;&s;ing: Let him like it as ill as He plea&s;es, I dare at lea&s;t, undertake, it &s;hall ea&s;ily defend it &s;elf again&s;t any Attack, of His making; which, pray Sir, inform Him, &s;ince you are His greate&s;t Admirer, and oblige</P>

<P N="1">(1) I Call <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia The Land of Night,</HI> not only <HI>Literally,</HI> as its general Di&s;tance from the Sun occa&s;ions tedious and uncomfortable Winters, but al&s;o in a <HI>Me|taphorical</HI> Sen&s;e, becau&s;e an almo&s;t total Ab&s;ence of the Arts (till this <HI>Czar</HI>'s Reign) had wrapt the Country in a Night of Ignorance.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>In that Contracted Name.

Nor is there any other Difference in the Words than the Contraction only, &s;ince the antient Latin Pronunciation was not <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> as we &s;peak it, but the <HI>C</HI> being pronounc'd as a <HI>K,</HI> made <HI>Kai&s;ar,</HI> and, in that Manner, it was undoubtedly &s;poken by the <HI>Romans.</HI> The Germans have no other Title for the Emperors to this Day, than <HI>Kai&s;ar,</HI> which the &s;malle&s;t Variation changes into <HI>Czar,</HI> according to the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Appellation.</P>
