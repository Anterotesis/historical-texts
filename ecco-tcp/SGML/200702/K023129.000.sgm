<P>_THE Reflections of <HI>Horace,</HI> and the Judgments pa&s;t in this Epi&s;tle to <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> &s;eem'd &s;o &s;ea&s;onable to the pre&s;ent Times, that I could not help applying them to the u&s;e of my own Country. The Author thought them con&s;iderable enough to addre&s;s them to His Prince; whom he paints with all the great and good Qualities of a Monarch, upon whom the <HI>Romans</HI> depended for the En|crea&s;e of an <HI>Ab&s;olute Empire.</HI> But to make the Poem en|tirely Engli&s;h, I was willing to add one or two &s;uch, as contribute to the Happine&s;s of a <HI>Free People,</HI> and are more con&s;i&s;tent with the Welfare of <HI>our Neighbours.</HI></P>
<P>This Epi&s;tle will &s;how the learned World to have fallen into two mi&s;takes; one, that <HI>Augu&s;tus was a Patron of Poets in general;</HI> whereas he not only prohibited all but the Be&s;t Writers to name him, but recommended that Care even to the Civil Magi&s;trate: <HI>Admonebat Praetores, ne paterentur Nomen &s;uum ob&s;olefieri,</HI> &amp;c. The other to imagine this Piece to be a <HI>general Di&s;cour&s;e of Poetry;</HI> whereas it is an <HI>Apology for the Poets,</HI> in order to render <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> more their Patron. <HI>Horace</HI> here pleads the Cau&s;e of his Cotemporaries, fir&s;t again&s;t the Ta&s;te of the
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
Town, who&s;e humour it was to magnify the Authors of the preceding Age; &s;econdly again&s;t the Court and Nobi|lity, who encouraged only the Writers for the Theatre; and la&s;tly again&s;t the Emperor him&s;elf, who had conceived them of little u&s;e to the Government. He &s;hews (by a view of the Progre&s;s of Learning, and the Change of Ta&s;te a|mong the <HI>Romans</HI>) that the Introduction of the Polite Arts of <HI>Greece</HI> had given the Writers of his Time great advan|tages over their Predece&s;&s;ors, that their <HI>Morals</HI> were much improved, and the Licence of tho&s;e ancient Poets re&s;train|ed: that <HI>Satire</HI> and <HI>Comedy</HI> were become more ju&s;t and u&s;eful; that whatever extravagancies were left on the Stage, were owing to the Ill Ta&s;te of the Nobility; that Poets, under due Regulations, were in many re&s;pects u&s;e|ful to the <HI>State;</HI> and concludes, that it was upon them the Emperor him&s;elf mu&s;t depend, for his Fame with Po&s;te|rity.</P>
<P>We may farther learn from this Epi&s;tle, that <HI>Horace</HI> made his Court to this Great Prince, by writing with a decent Freedom toward him, with a ju&s;t Contempt of his low Flatterers, and with a manly Regard to his own Character.</P>
