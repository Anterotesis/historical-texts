<P>_THERE is nothing &s;o difficult as writing on a &s;ubject, laid before you in vague terms, which have a double|de&s;ign'd meaning. Ambiguities mu&s;t ari&s;e, and therefore mu&s;t be excus'd.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider the paper I am to treat of, under its title of <HI>The account of the clear produce in every year,</HI> that is, of what is paid in of the civil-li&s;t in every year on, or before the very Mid&s;ummer-day, on which it was due.</P>
<P>This account was humbly pre&s;ented to Parlia|ment without any one voucher from the offices of revenue, and is the fir&s;t in&s;tance of the kind; &s;ome &s;ort of vouchers for appearance at lea&s;t having been always produc'd on the like oc|ca&s;ions. This is made up only from the trea&s;ury books of the receipt within every &s;ingle year.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4">
When the fir&s;t demand was made for a de|ficiency of the civil-li&s;t for 1728, the account of that year's receipt was &s;tated at no more than 684,407<HI>l.</HI> This new account of 33 years, &s;tates the receipt of that year at 708,228<HI>l.</HI> This dif|ference is it&s;elf a proof of fal&s;e accounts de|livered into Parliament at that time to defraud the nation. It is now publickly acknowledged, that this difference of 23,821<HI>l.</HI> was neither a de|ficiency, nor an arrear &s;tanding out at Mid&s;um|mer-day 1728; con&s;equently 91,772<HI>l.</HI> being the remainder of 708,228<HI>l.</HI> deducted from 800,000<HI>l.</HI> was the whole then wanting to com|plete the latter &s;um clear to his Maje&s;ty that very day it was due; yet the nation was obliged to give the crown 115,000<HI>l.</HI> for the arrears, which had at fir&s;t been demanded, as a deficiency in the produce.</P>
<P>This fal&s;e account &s;tands in the printed journals of 1729 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 321.</NOTE>, but by the late new ac|count is fully detected in a &s;urprizing, able, and
<PB N="7" REF="5">
ma&s;terly manner. Yet this was cramm'd down the whole legi&s;lature, which enacted that there was an arrear of 115,000<HI>l.</HI> and for the glory of tho&s;e times it &s;tands recorded in our &s;tatutes to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>In the new account the year 1729 is &s;aid to have produc'd but 753,576<HI>l.</HI> In the &s;ame ac|count the year 1728 produces, as &s;et down already, 708,228<HI>l.</HI> con&s;equently 1729 produces but 45,348<HI>l.</HI> more than 1728. Now it appear'd upon the examination of the committee in April 1729, that over and above the 708,228<HI>l.</HI> re|ceiv'd to the very Mid&s;ummer-day 1728, there had been &s;ince receiv'd on account of that year's pretended deficient civil-li&s;t 128,115<HI>l.</HI> by the April following, and that there &s;till remained ar|rears &s;tanding out in the cu&s;toms, and in the hands of the country po&s;t-ma&s;ters 76,165<HI>l.</HI> The&s;e three la&s;t mention'd &s;ums amount to 912,508<HI>l.</HI> be&s;ides the 115,000<HI>l.</HI> given for an ar|rear; and yet the next year 1729, &s;tands charged with a produce but of 45,348<HI>l.</HI> more than the preceeding 1728.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6">
I an&s;wer not for the veracity of any accounts; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s I have not the mo&s;t implicit faith in the trea&s;ury accounts: when I con&s;ider for how many years the revenue of the hawkers and pedlars e&s;cap'd them, and for how many more the 4&frac12; <HI>per cent.</HI> levied in Barbadoes and the Leeward-i&s;lands. Nor could I be &s;urpri&s;ed, if now and then a whole month's revenue of the civil-li&s;t &s;hould e&s;cape: but for the pre&s;ent I will acknowledge, that the Virginia quit|rents were mo&s;t properly, and with the <HI>nice&s;t oeconomy</HI> di&s;pos'd of for his maje&s;ty's <HI>&s;pecial &s;er|vice.</HI></P>
<P>It has been mention'd, that the money re|ceiv'd at the Exchequer for the year 1729 was 753,576<HI>l.</HI> Now the 115,000<HI>l.</HI> for arrears was paid in there that year, and therefore ought to have appear'd, and been added to the produce of that year, and over and above the 115,000<HI>l.</HI> it mu&s;t be remembered too, that from 1728 they had in advance the difference between the pretended produce that year of 708,228<HI>l.</HI> and the real produce of 912,508<HI>l.</HI> to an&s;wer any
<PB N="9" REF="7">
future arrears. But perhaps trea&s;ury books may look on the 115,000<HI>l.</HI> as a free gift only, and it may appear <HI>there as very properly di&s;pos'd of in that &s;hape again.</HI></P>
<P>This 33 years account &s;ays, there was re|ceiv'd by the exci&s;e for the year 1728, the &s;um of 227,864<HI>l.</HI> but when the deficiency for that year was demanded it was charg'd with the pro|duce of 194,234<HI>l.</HI> only. It was afterwards prov'd, that there had been paid to the late Queen within that time 18,750<HI>l.</HI> which added to the above 194,234<HI>l.</HI> makes a &s;um of 212,984<HI>l.</HI> &s;till 14,880<HI>l.</HI> is wanting to make up the 227,864<HI>l.</HI> It is probable, that without fore&s;eeing the con|&s;equences, the &s;um of 12,653<HI>l.</HI> remaining in the Exchequer at Mid&s;ummer 1728, for the civil-li&s;t lottery of 1713, may be included in the above 227,864<HI>l.</HI> though no notice is taken of it in this new account: but then there will be &s;till wanting 2227<HI>l.</HI> to make the total of the &s;aid clear produce in that year, as now de|liver'd in, agree with the &s;ame article laid be|fore the committee in 1729, upon the &s;ubject of the then deficiency of 115,000<HI>l.</HI> This &s;hort
<PB N="10" REF="8">
detail is given only as an in&s;tance of the&s;e in|accurate accounts.</P>
<P>It would be tedious and endle&s;s to make all the proper ob&s;ervations on this long period of accounts. I &s;hall therefore confine my&s;elf to that &s;econd mo&s;t extraordinary and delicate per|formance, I mean the account for the pretended deficiencies in the duties and revenues for &s;even years back at Mid&s;ummer 1746, amounting to no le&s;s than 456,733<HI>l.</HI> What a play of words is here? The duties and revenues are one thing; the art of making up accounts of the receipts only between Mid&s;ummer and Mid&s;ummer, without regard to the arrears either of that, or of former years, is another thing. Was not this &s;ufficiently expos'd in the examination into the 115,000<HI>l.</HI> deficiency of 1728? Why have they not now deliver'd to Parliament a &s;tate of the clear produce of the&s;e revenues for the whole 33 years? Why play'd the old exploded game fixing the title call'd for on the out&s;ide of the paper, and another title within relating to the clear produce of each year <HI>in every year.</HI> But had it been now deliver'd under the genuine
<PB N="11" REF="9">
title it was call'd for, which is, An account of the clear produce of the &s;everal branches of the re|venue, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which implies not only the receipts to each Mid&s;ummer-day, but all arrears out&s;tand|ing and afterwards receiv'd, it might have ap|pear'd, that in the two former in&s;tances of de|ficiencies the arrears in tho&s;e two periods, added to the receipts given in, would have been a re|dundance in 1728, and far &s;hort of 456,733<HI>l.</HI> demanded in 1746; by which means the gro&s;s|ne&s;s of the impo&s;itions then would have appear'd in too glaring a light.</P>
<P>What were the methods taken to cover &s;uch extraordinary impo&s;itions? It was to call for the accounts from the &s;everal officers of revenue to be laid before Parliament, under the proper titles, and then to give private orders to tho&s;e officers to make tho&s;e accounts up in a direct contrary way. This was di&s;cover'd and prov'd by the commi&s;&s;ioners them&s;elves of the &s;everal offices, on their examination before the committee, in the ca&s;e of the fir&s;t pretended deficiency of 115,000<HI>l.</HI> and was expre&s;sly confirmed by the letter of a per&s;on in authority, giving &s;uch pri|vate
<PB N="12" REF="10">
orders, and produc'd by a principal officer of the revenue in his own ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of the &s;econd deficiency in 1746, which had a retro&s;pect of 7 years, the only way that remain'd, was the hope, that the novelty and &s;urprize of it would carry it&s;elf, and not be liable to any detection from the offices. The Trea&s;ury therefore were fully re&s;olv'd to make up the account from their own books; (a prece|dent, we &s;ee follow'd in this 33 years account) for who could detect them there? Accordingly they deliver'd the accounts from their books, as of a certain round deficiency of duties and re|venue.</P>
<P>But to carry on &s;ome &s;hew of proper vouchers, as u&s;ual, they &s;ent their orders to the Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;e, and Po&s;t-office, to know what &s;ums they had applied out of their &s;everal branches by virtue of &s;tanding warrants from the Trea&s;ury, during this period of 7 years. To have a&s;k'd of them, as u&s;ual, what was the real produce of tho&s;e revenues in that period, however nece&s;&s;ary and proper for the public, was the very thing
<PB N="13" REF="11">
which the Trea&s;ury de&s;ir'd &s;hould not be known. To make up an account from their own books, was &s;ufficient for their purpo&s;e. Yet the pro|ducing &s;omething from tho&s;e offices would carry a plau&s;ible appearance, and be an aid to im|po&s;ition: They therefore ridiculou&s;ly produc'd certificates from the&s;e &s;everal offices of the pay|ments i&s;&s;ued by them upon the e&s;tabli&s;h'd war|rants; as if the Trea&s;ury could be &s;uppos'd igno|rant of &s;uch payments, and at the &s;ame time pre|tend to know the produce of tho&s;e revenues, from their own books, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the commi&s;&s;ioners. It may be indeed, that the&s;e curious books of account take no other notice of the produce in every year; but what they have the expenditure of in every year; and that the re&s;t is left to auditor's accounting. But does there not now ari&s;e a difficulty as to this 33 years account? Has any application been made to all, or any one of the offices for the lea&s;t informa|tion re&s;pecting the produce of the civil-li&s;t re|venue?</P>
<P>I &s;hall now compare &s;ome other particulars in this new account with what was formerly de|liver'd,
<PB N="14" REF="12">
when the deficiencies were in que&s;tion before Parliament, in order to &s;hew the inac|curacy of trea&s;ury-books. I begin with the land rents.</P>
<P>Whatever &s;ums the receivers pay upon trea|&s;ury warrants, is as much part of the produce, as the balances they pay into the Exchequer, after &s;uch warrants have been &s;atisfied; and are equally applicable to the intent of a civil-li&s;t, as tho&s;e balances, it being to &s;upport and maintain the honour and dignity of the crown. In the 33 years account the&s;e rents produce but 5480<HI>l.</HI> in the 3 years, 1742, 3, and 4; whereas it appears by the Exchequer vouchers relating to the 7 years pretended deficiency, that tho&s;e 3 years had produc'd 9364<HI>l.</HI> A &s;mall difference indeed of 3884<HI>l.</HI> in &s;o &s;mall an ar|ticle; and much to the credit of the new ac|count's correctne&s;s; and it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd that the trea&s;ury-books only can give an account of what the receivers had paid on warrants drawn by them&s;elves, exclu&s;ive of the monies paid by them into the Exchequer. I cannot conclude this paragraph without ob&s;erving, that in 1740,
<PB N="15" REF="13">
the fir&s;t year of the 7, the produce of the ex|ci&s;e was given in at the time that immen&s;e de|ficiency was claim'd, at 213,792<HI>l.</HI> whereas in the new 33 years account it &s;tands at no more than 209,852<HI>l.</HI> Another &s;mall difference of 3940<HI>l.</HI> between two trea&s;ury accounts of the &s;ame ar|ticle in the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>When the accounts for the&s;e pretended <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the printed Journal 1746, page 205.</NOTE> de|ficiencies of duties and revenue for 7 years were peru&s;ed, they were found not &s;atisfactory, other accounts were called for from the &s;everal offices of the revenue, and were delivered to the Hou&s;e by them; they are verily curious, and literaly fulfil what the Lords &s;ay in their prote&s;t the 10th of May, 1729, again&s;t the 115,000<HI>l.</HI> "When we reflect in what manner the&s;e ac|counts have been made up, and in what man|ner they have been brought in, we cannot but apprehend that a door is opened by this pre|cedent for laying new and exce&s;&s;ive charges on the nation; the revenues appropriated to the u&s;es of his Maje&s;ty's civil-li&s;t, are &s;ubject
<PB N="16" REF="14">
in their own nature to vary, and even when there is no deficiency in the produce, there may be arrears in the receipt. The&s;e arrears may ea&s;ily be increa&s;ed by the management of de&s;igning mini&s;ters, by private directions to receivers, and by artful methods of &s;tating accounts, from all which we cannot but ap|prehend, that now this precedent is made, we may have frequent accounts of arrears."</P>
<P>The&s;e accounts from the Cu&s;toms, Exci&s;e, and Po&s;t-office, have no regard to the arrears &s;tanding out on Mid&s;ummer 1739, which probably were about the &s;um of 200,000<HI>l.</HI> as they were about that &s;um at Mid&s;ummer 1728, and whatever &s;um they were ought to be reckon'd in aid of the deficiency of the &s;even years.</P>
<P>The accounts of the cu&s;toms are from Chri&s;t|mas 1738 to 1745. They &s;ay, "the account of the Cu&s;toms are made up from Chri&s;tmas to Chri&s;tmas, &s;o that this account could not be given from Mid&s;ummer to Mid&s;ummer;" they likewi&s;e &s;ay, "It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;hew what has been paid &s;ince Chri&s;tmas 1745 of
<PB N="17" REF="15">
the produce of the above years, becau&s;e there is no di&s;tinction in the payments, whether for arrears or growing receipts."</P>
<P>This is roundly a&s;&s;erted; but then how came it that they could in 1729 make up an account of the produce from Mid&s;ummer 1727, to Mid|&s;ummer 1728; and how did it happen that they could then make up the account of the arrears received &s;ince Mid&s;ummer 1728, and paid into the Exchequer, to the amount of 33,013<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>To account for the differences between the accounts, there was a mo&s;t ridiculous explana|tion given of them, in a paper from the Trea|&s;ury, I don't mean a publick one; it relates, that this revenue produced, as <HI>certified from the Ex|chequer,</HI> 1,647,221<HI>l.</HI> and that the Comptroller of the Cu&s;toms account, "for the &s;even years ended at Chri&s;tmas 1745, when he made up the net produce to be 1,807,766<HI>l.</HI> from which deduct the payments to the Prince of Wales 140,000<HI>l.</HI> leaves 1,667,766<HI>l.</HI> the dif|ference between the&s;e two accounts is little more than 20,534<HI>l.</HI> but as one is an account
<PB N="18" REF="16">
of a <HI>net receipt</HI> in one period, and the other of a <HI>net produce</HI> in another period, it is no won|der that there is a difference between the two accounts." This is acknowledging that the Records of the Exchequer received all the pro|duce as e&s;timated, except that difference, and &s;uch &s;ort of evidence we have for making up of the&s;e accounts; neverthele&s;s, the account from the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e certifies, that the arrears &s;tanding out at Mid&s;ummer 1746, was 146,040<HI>l.</HI> it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the u&s;ual arrears &s;tand|ing out in every year, during the reign of King George the Fir&s;t, as likewi&s;e in the fir&s;t year of his late Maje&s;ty, was about 102,000<HI>l.</HI> was this very extraordinary arrear left in the hands of the receiver or receivers, to create a deficiency of the duties for 7 years; does it not now appear upon the whole of this account of the produce of the Cu&s;toms, that it is founded on e&s;timated and fictitious valuations, to an&s;wer the pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>There was a remarkable difference between the Trea&s;ury-account of the net receipt, and the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Exci&s;e account of the
<PB N="19" REF="17">
net produce, to reconcile them, the &s;ame ex|planation as has already been mentioned as to the Cu&s;toms, &s;ays, "The account of the net pro|duce of the hereditary and temporary Exci&s;e, according to the commi&s;&s;ioners accounts given into Parliament, is <HI>1,437,373<HI>l.</HI> the Exchequer receipt</HI> of that revenue amounted to 1,326,861<HI>l.</HI> the difference 110,511<HI>l.</HI> after the hereditary and temporary Exci&s;e is paid into the Ex|chequer, it is chargeable with the payment of <HI>15,759<HI>l.</HI> per annum,</HI> to the South-Sea Com|pany for &s;ub&s;cription into their capital of the lottery 1713, which for 7 years is 110,318<HI>l.</HI> the difference 193<HI>l.</HI> therefore had the King charged him&s;elf with <HI>the produce</HI> in&s;tead of the receipt of this revenue, the difference would have been only 193<HI>l.</HI> in the 7 years."</P>
<P>The civil-li&s;t Lottery of 1713, which was for 35,000<HI>l.</HI> a year, and to be paid out of the Ex|ci&s;e, was for 32 years, to pay the intere&s;t and principal of 500,000<HI>l.</HI> There was &s;ub&s;cribed of it into the South-Sea Company 464,990<HI>l.</HI> at <HI>4<HI>l.</HI> per Cent.</HI> which is <HI>18,599<HI>l.</HI> per annum,</HI> which multiplied by 7 years would no ways an&s;wer what
<PB N="20" REF="18">
15,759<HI>l.</HI> was de&s;ired to do; the remaining an|nual &s;um of 16,400<HI>l.</HI> which ought to have gone to the &s;inking fund, to pay off that principal &s;um &s;ub&s;cribed, was taken from it, under the ini|quitous pretence of its having emerged into the civil-li&s;t, founded only, and no otherwi&s;e au|thorized, but by an opinion obtained from his Maje&s;ty's learned Council, on a fal&s;e &s;tate of the Ca&s;e. It now appears, that the &s;aid annual &s;um of 16,400<HI>l.</HI> has not been accounted for as a part of the civil-li&s;t revenue for the 7 years deficiency of duties, and that amounts to 114,800<HI>l.</HI> where has this emerged again.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Exci&s;e, in all their former accounts delivered to Parliament, in ac|counting for the produce of the civil-li&s;t revenue, have con&s;tantly deducted the &s;um of 35,000<HI>l.</HI> a year for that civil-li&s;t lottery, from the gro&s;s produce, and the remainder is the net produce of the civil-li&s;t revenue; and they are &s;till obliged by the law to pay annually into the Ex|chequer that &s;um of 35,000<HI>l.</HI> they have nothing to do with the di&s;po&s;ition of it afterwards, and
<PB N="21" REF="19">
therefore cannot lawfully alter their method of accounting for it, from a future di&s;po&s;ition of it.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners by their account to the Trea&s;ury of 21 November 1746, declare, that the monies which have been applied by the Ca&s;hier, to the u&s;es of his Maje&s;ty's civil govern|ment for the year 1745, was 22,922<HI>l.</HI> but in their account of the &s;econd of January 1746, was only 20,000<HI>l.</HI> though the remaining &s;um of 2922<HI>l.</HI> was fir&s;t charged by them as paid to Lord Orford for his pen&s;ion; and this is the only &s;um that appears to have been paid him out of the pro|duce of the &s;everal Offices of the Revenue, and is this all that has been paid him? but this is alone &s;ufficient to prove that this Exci&s;e account to Parliament cannot be right, and admini&s;ters &s;uf|ficient cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, as to other articles. I &s;hall now &s;tate this Exci&s;e account in another manner, as one &s;hort convincing propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>This account makes the net produce to be 1,437,373<HI>l.</HI> to which add only the 140,000<HI>l.</HI> paid the Prince of Wales, the real net pro|duce is 1,577,373<HI>l.</HI> the account of the Exche|quer
<PB N="22" REF="20">
is 1,326,861<HI>l.</HI> to which add, paid by the Ca&s;hier for his Maje&s;ty's warrants, the &s;um of 142,922<HI>l.</HI> makes the whole but 1,469,783<HI>l.</HI> which being deducted from the net produce there remains 117,590<HI>l.</HI> of which there was &s;tanding out in arrears at Mid&s;ummer 1746, the &s;um of 74,258<HI>l.</HI> and therefore there could be in that time only the &s;um of 43,342<HI>l.</HI> that could be applied for the civil-li&s;t lottery of 1713, for &s;even years.</P>
<P>This account &s;ays, the arrears &s;tanding out on Mid&s;ummer 1746, the very day they were due on was 74,258<HI>l.</HI> on Mid&s;ummer-day 1728, they were but 58,981<HI>l.</HI> which is now &s;o much more than u&s;ual, that it may be &s;u&s;pected to have been left in the hands of the receivers to create a greater deficiency in the duties and revenue. The date of this account is the Second of January 1746, and they there acknowledge that the &s;um of 70,060<HI>l.</HI> had been paid in for tho&s;e arrears &s;tanding out at Mid&s;ummer 1746.</P>
<P>The account delivered from the Po&s;t-Office for the produce of the &s;even years, on which I

mu&s;t fir&s;t make a &s;mall ob&s;ervation on the cor|rectne&s;s of the Trea&s;ury accounts, that for the &s;even years deficiency charges the receipt of the Po&s;t-Office for 1746, to be 15,943<HI>l.</HI> this new ac|count for 33 years but 13,443<HI>l.</HI> This is the mo&s;t delicate of all accounts that were delivered into Parliament. The Commi&s;&s;ioners have prudent|ly avoided the &s;igning of it, having no doubt heard what happened to others in 1729, when the account of the produce of the civil-li&s;t re|venue was called for by Parliament, and their receiving a letter from the Trea&s;ury to make them up in another manner, to impo&s;e on the Parliament; and the letter was produced for their own ju&s;tification, they therefore now left it to the accomptant to make up &s;omething of an account that might pa&s;s for the pre&s;ent; it is &s;o &s;lovenly done, that they have not ca&s;t up the to|tal of any of the &s;everal heads of deductions, nor the account of the net produce for the &s;even years.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t mo&s;t extraordinary article I &s;hall take notice of is the charges of the management, which as it &s;tands here for the&s;e &s;even years is
<PB N="24" REF="22">
nole&s;s than 1,070,392<HI>l.</HI> that it is greatly increa&s;ed during this period is certain, but it is impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould come to &s;o enormous a &s;um; and there mu&s;t be &s;omething not right in this article, which may be thus &s;tated, to cover &s;omething el&s;e, for the charges of management for the year 1728, was but 23,005<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>During the old &s;y&s;tem, we were not permit|ted to ea&s;e the nation of the heavy weight of unnece&s;&s;ary charges in the collection of the re|venues, but they were increa&s;ed for the &s;ake of a corrupt influence over the electors and elected; and the nation is greatly deceived in thinking that the crown pays for the charges of collecting the civil-li&s;t revenues; which is a rent-charge, and therefore the collection of it is a burden on the people; the mini&s;ters therefore have not been de&s;irous of ea&s;ing the nation of any part of &s;o unnece&s;&s;ary a burden, but our exhau&s;ted &s;tate may now require it.</P>
<P>This account from the Po&s;t-Office, makes the net produce for the &s;even years, including the payments of his Maje&s;ty's Warrants and
<PB N="25" REF="23">
Grants, to be 228,150<HI>l.</HI> the Trea&s;ury account of the deficiencies of tho&s;e duties for tho&s;e &s;even years acknowledges the receipt in every year on the very Mid&s;ummer-day they were due on, to amount to 214,264<HI>l.</HI> which leaves an arrear on the &s;even years but of 13,886<HI>l.</HI> yet this Po&s;t-Office account charges the arrears &s;tanding out on Mid&s;ummer-day 1746, to be 54,734<HI>l.</HI> is not this very &s;urpri&s;ing? The ac|count is dated the 27th of January 1746, and &s;ays, that there has been paid of tho&s;e ar|rears, before that date, the &s;um of 39,251<HI>l.</HI> I have all the&s;e arrears been artfully kept back for the &s;ake of the deficiencies of the duties.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery now leads us to examine the article of the Po&s;t-Office for 1747; in this new 33 years account, which is the year after the pretended deficiencies, it charged the net receipt of the Po&s;t-Office in every year to be but 24,602<HI>l.</HI> for that year; yet it now appears there was paid in, between Mid&s;ummer 1746, and Mid&s;ummer 1757, before the 27th of January 1747, the &s;um of 39,251l be&s;ides what was paid in of the remaining arrears of
<PB N="26" REF="24">
15,481<HI>l.</HI> and all that has been paid in for the produce of the year 1747. May we not there|fore &s;u&s;pect that this arrear of the Po&s;t-Office for 54,734<HI>l.</HI> the arrear of the Exci&s;e for 74,258<HI>l.</HI> and the arrear of the Cu&s;tom for 146,040<HI>l.</HI> amounting to 274,032<HI>l.</HI> has not been account|ed for &s;ince.</P>
<P>Some of the fir&s;t hours, at the very beginning of the la&s;t reign, pa&s;&s;ed in a due con&s;ideration of certain money affairs; to that immediately &s;uc|ceeded the bidding for the admini&s;tration, which ro&s;e from 700,000<HI>l.</HI> in the late reign, to 800,000<HI>l.</HI> a year, and in the &s;ame manner the bargain was &s;truck for it, it was opened &s;o to the Parliament, and a bill was ordered in for that purpo&s;e, but then a bidding <HI>after Game</HI> was play'd; it was ob&s;erved, that the revenue in the preceeding reign was not all paid on the day that they were due, but were in a few months afterwards, and that therefore a net receipt within every year, was pe|nuriou&s;ly calculated to be more advantageous. This occa&s;ioned the bringing into the bill that extraordinary clau&s;e which could not be then
<PB N="27" REF="25">
taken notice of, but was &s;ufficiently the next year, when the merit of the after-game was to be claimed; it was thought the revenue had pro|duced for that year but 684,407<HI>l.</HI> the intrigue of the clo&s;et obliged the mini&s;ter to make good that deficiency, and he demanded it as &s;uch of the Parliament; and when that was too much ex|po&s;ed for his own friends to vote it as a defici|ency, he was &s;till nece&s;&s;itated to take it as an arrear. No one could ever think that expo&s;ed and intriguing precedent would ever have been impo&s;ed again on the people.</P>
<P>We were engaged on the Continent in the war for the Au&s;trian &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, our part was directed and carried on, on the mo&s;t ab&s;urd, &s;elf-contradic|tory principles. We might have had a peace by the treaty at Hanau, and the favourite mea|&s;ure <HI>from natal predilection</HI> would have been &s;atisfied for that time by &s;ecularizations. It was approved of by his Maje&s;ty, and by his Mini&s;ter with him, who &s;ent it over to the Regency to be approved of here, four of them, though there were nineteen Lord Ju&s;tices,
<PB N="28" REF="26">
without communicating it to the re&s;t of them, clande&s;tinely took it upon them&s;elves to refu&s;e it. It would have de&s;troy'd their &s;y&s;tem for their own admini&s;tration. They kept the &s;e|cret, they added to the flame of the nation a|gain&s;t the mini&s;ter who was for peace, as being the only mini&s;ter that was for carrying on the war, they &s;ucceeded, and his Maje&s;ty was forced at the end of the year 1744, to part with the mini&s;ter that was for that peace, and we were then nece&s;&s;itated to go on with the war, to give hopes of obtaining at la&s;t the <HI>Favourite Mea&s;ure,</HI> which they had prevented being obtained by another; <HI>flattering them&s;elves that events would ari&s;e, to put him out of humour with his favourite mea&s;ure;</HI> which they happily obtain'd for that time, by carrying it on till they could rai&s;e no more money, and left the hopes to remain to the next broils that could be made or found on the Continent; in the mean time recover our finances; reduce the intere&s;t of the funds from four to three <HI>per cent.</HI> without giving the poor people any ea&s;e from it, by taking off their taxes; for they were re&s;erved to be applied to
<PB N="29" REF="27">
&s;uch proper u&s;es. In the beginning of the year 1746, the mini&s;ter had been guilty of a mo&s;t grievous provoking offence, did not all the&s;e hard&s;hips then require <HI>douceurs.</HI> On the eighth of December 1746, the demand was made for the deficiencies of the duties and revenues of the civil-li&s;t, for 456,733<HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>I will not touch upon votes of credit, &s;ub|&s;idies, payments of Foreign troops, nor on the true motives or cau&s;es of our de&s;perate bloody war, nor on the third partition treaty for the dividing of the Pru&s;&s;ian Bear-&s;kin; for they may be thought foreign to my Occa&s;ional Ob&s;erva|tions.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely believe that the only motive for calling for an account of the clear produce of the 33 years, was to do honour to his late Ma|je&s;ty, by undeceiving the people as to the enor|mity of his civil-li&s;t revenue; and with no view to do honour to his admini&s;trations, by &s;hewing with how little they had done &s;o much; nor that it could then be conceived, that a double-titled
<PB N="30" REF="28">
account would have been given of it, and of the unavoidable con&s;equences that mu&s;t ari&s;e from it. The experienced Old Sy&s;temites, with the hopes of a &s;ucce&s;sful after-game, highly blame the mea&s;ure of accepting the 800,000<HI>l.</HI> a year certain, and thereby the giving up the benefit of the late civil-li&s;t act, in not accounting for any years &s;urplus, and the benefit of accounting for fictitious deficiencies: &s;ome of the lower herd of murmurers, who judge of the Rectitude of mea&s;ures by names or epithets to names, have ca&s;t an eye only on the &s;um total of 26,182,981<HI>l.</HI> as the produce of 33 years in every year, and then dividing that by 33, they find by certain unerring occular demon&s;tration, that his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty has obtained a greater civil-li&s;t revenue than his late Maje&s;ty had. From all that has been urged in the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, it mu&s;t now appear, that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for the true infor|mation of the nation, and to do ju&s;tice to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, that the account of the clear produce of the civil-li&s;t revenues from Mid&s;um|mer 1727 to Mid&s;ummer la&s;t, as called for by
<PB N="31" REF="29">
the Parliament, be truly and faithfully laid before them.</P>
<P>The arts, the ridiculous in&s;inuations, the many in&s;ulting clamours, to &s;upport and revive the expiring Old Sy&s;tem, mu&s;t be de&s;pi&s;ed by every hone&s;t man, who rejoices in &s;eeing the true &s;pi|rit of our con&s;titution once more re&s;tored, which had been &s;o long de&s;paired of; not only by the mo&s;t &s;olemn words and a&s;&s;urances from the Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">e, but by publick acts; the taking of 800,000<HI>l.</HI> a year certain for the civil-li&s;t re|venue.&mdash;All our judges are confirmed to us, not one turned out, as was at the beginning of the late reign, to give another interpretation to the act of &s;ettlement than was before under&s;tood to be the true &s;en&s;e and meaning of it; by putting one out, and afterwards re&s;toring him upon the fir&s;t vacancy, to e&s;tabli&s;h that prerogative in the Crown; and by giving freedom to every place|man to vote for his own repre&s;entative in Parlia|ment.&mdash;In this &s;ituation of my King and Country, having &s;ome knowledge of the&s;e re|venues, I thought it might be of &s;ervice to the

publick to make the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, and give this. Sketch of the Conduct of our Money affairs un|der the Old Sy&s;tem; wi&s;hing &s;ome abler pen would do the &s;ame as to our Continent mea|&s;ures: And that All the People may be truly &s;en&s;ible and fully convinced of that great ble&s;&s;ing of Providence to them, in giving them a KING BORN AND EDUCATED A BRITON.</P>
