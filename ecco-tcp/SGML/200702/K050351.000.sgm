<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A Propo&s;al &s;o evidently calculated for the Publick as this is, &s;eems to want no Preface, and &s;hould have none, but for that dreadful Principle of Uncha|ritablene&s;s which rages among &s;ome Peo|ple, who &s;earch for Evil in every thing offered by a Hand they do not like, and &s;eek not to be Serv'd or Pleas'd, but to find Fault.</P>
<P>Let &s;uch know, that the Author of this Tract thus acting without Gain or Reward, equally &s;atisfied in his own &s;incere Endea|vour for the Publick Intere&s;t, whether accepted or rejected, and wholly Neglect|ing anyother Te&s;timonial, depends upon Time and Truth, for his Vindication.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">What is here offer'd, is upon a Point His Maje&s;ty has declar'd to be Important, and Experience has &s;hew'd has been always Dif|ficult. That Difficulty was the Spring of the&s;e Thoughts, and His Maje&s;ty's Speech the Spirit that gave them Motion; and the Author cannot doubt but his End being &s;incerely the &s;ame, the Endeavour will, at lea&s;t, give no Offence.</P>
<P>He could have gone farther in Schemes for Accompli&s;hing the Great Work of Encou|raging Seamen, but he is no Projector, and de&s;ires not to be Officious.</P>

<HEAD><PB N="1" REF="4">SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON THE REASONABLENESS and NECESSITY of Encrea&s;ing and Encouraging the SEAMEN.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A State of the Seamen's Ca&s;e: Whether their Numbers are decrea&s;ed, or not; and whether they are under Di&s;couragements, or not. What tho&s;e Di&s;couragements are; and by what Ways their Grievances may be redre&s;s'd.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Subject of this Tract, tho' it will be hand|led in a new and different manner from what has been done before, is not new in it&s;elf; nor is the End and De&s;ign of it new, tho' the Me|thods propo&s;ed will be &s;o. Many Attempts have been made, as well in this Age, as in the la&s;t, in Behalf of the poor Seamen (or at lea&s;t &s;aid to be &s;o) and much fruitle&s;s un&s;ucce&s;sful Pains has been taken, to &s;hew us the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of entring into &s;ome ju&s;t Mea&s;ures for their En|crea&s;e and Encouragement; but they have indeed been fruitle&s;s and un&s;ucce&s;sful, becau&s;e they have been weak and unperforming.</P>
<P>However, the&s;e frequent Attempts are a Concur|rence of Te&s;timonies to the Importance of the Subject, and &s;erve to let us &s;ee that it has all along been look'd upon as a Thing the Nation greatly wanted; that
<PB N="2" REF="5">
it was well worth the Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e that had the Pro&s;perity of their Country at heart; and that it would be a &s;ingular Service to the Publick, to find, if po&s;&s;ible, a Remedy for a thing which was &s;o &s;en&s;i|ble a Grievance to the whole Nation, and yet &s;o diffi|cult to be redre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>But in all the Attempts or E&s;&s;ays made on this Sub|ject, at lea&s;t &s;uch as have been made publick, I have ob&s;erved, they have rather run out into long Excla|mations upon the Grievance it&s;elf, crying out again&s;t the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Seamen, the Frauds committed by their Officers, the Violence of Impre&s;&s;ing Land|men in&s;tead of Sailors, tearing them in an injurious manner from their Families, their Trades, and Em|ployments, to carry them on board the Ships of War, where they are u&s;ele&s;s, ignorant, untractable, and rather burthen&s;ome than &s;erviceable: Likewi&s;e the impre&s;|&s;ing Seamen, who are really &s;uch, in an Illegal manner; as particularly, taking them out of Merchant-Ships, after Protections granted them, and while tho&s;e Ships lay upon Demorage, and at the Expence of Victuals and Wages, to the Ruin of the Voyage both to Mer|chants and Owners. The&s;e, and many other Oppre&s;|&s;ions and Injuries to the Seamen, and to the Merchants, things really great, and of Con&s;equence in them&s;elves, are the main Subject of the&s;e Complaints; and we find them frequently enlarged upon in former Writings, ve|ry emphatically.</P>
<P>But the Deficiency lies here, that in all that has been &s;aid on tho&s;e Heads, the Complaints take up the whole, or the main of their Di&s;cour&s;es, with perhaps a warm Recommendation to the Publick, or to the Parliament, to take it into their &s;erious Con&s;ideration. But very few, if any, of all tho&s;e laboured Pieces, <HI>at lea&s;t that I have met with,</HI> enter into the grand Que&s;tion, How, and which Way the&s;e things &s;hall be remedied; what Specifick may be propos'd for the effectual Re|dre&s;s of the Grievance, or in a Word, How, or which
<PB N="3" REF="6">
Way the Seamen &s;hall be <HI>Encreas'd</HI> or <HI>Encourag'd</HI>; and this Defect we &s;hall now endeavour to &s;upply.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain, that as to Encourage the Seamen, is to Encrea&s;e them, &s;o by the Di&s;couragements which they have met with, the Numbers of them have been very much decreas'd and dimini&s;h'd; and that not only at this time, but in former Reigns, in&s;omuch that the Publick has been made &s;en&s;ible of the Scarcity of Seamen, by the Difficulty of rai&s;ing them on any &s;ud|den Emergence; which Difficulty has been &s;uch, that no Undertaking of Importance, and which requir'd ex|traordinary Expedition, could be enter'd upon, 'till a &s;ufficient Number of Men could be procured, which was always a Work of Time.</P>
<P>This frequently retarded the Preparations in a mo&s;t remarkable manner; as in the time of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Wars, during the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and gave the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ometimes Opportunity to appear arm'd upon our Coa&s;t, and In&s;ult our Ports, before our Fleets were able, for want of Seamen, to go out to Sea. And not to look back &s;o far, the very &s;ame Defect gave the <HI>French</HI> the like Advantage again&s;t us &s;everal times, du|ring the late War; as particularly, at the Engagement off of <HI>Beachy,</HI> in the Year 1690, or thereabout; and on &s;everal other Occa&s;ions, which it is needle&s;s to re|peat.</P>
<P>Nor is the Encrea&s;e and Encouragement of Seamen, meerly as Seamen, the whole Sub&s;tance of the thing propos'd, but the Encouragement of them, as His Ma|je&s;ty expre&s;&s;es it in his Speech, <HI>That they may he Invi|ted, not Compelled to enter into the Service of their Coun|try.</HI> This is the Point in hand. As to the Merchants Service, it is a thing by it&s;elf, and may be &s;poken of apart; but the Publick Service, I &s;ay, is the Point be|fore me, and for which the Seamen are to be both <HI>en|creas'd</HI> and <HI>encourag'd</HI>; and for the bringing of which effectually to pa&s;s, this Tract is made publick.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">In all the former E&s;&s;ays of this kind (mentioned a|bove) this has been pretended, and we have often been made to expect it by flouri&s;hing Titles, and boa&s;ting Preambles, but little has been offered to make it Pra|cticable. Every body allow'd it was a nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful Work; that it ought to be done; that the Pub|lick Occa&s;ions call'd for it; that Ju&s;tice to the poor Seamen required it; and that, in a Word, it was almo&s;t every Body's Concern to put their helping Hands to &s;uch a Work, if it was in their Power to do any thing towards it. But whenever they came to con&s;ider (as the Hou&s;e terms it) of <HI>Ways and Means</HI> to bring it to pa&s;s, they could &s;ay very little to the Purpo&s;e; it proved a long perplexed Ca&s;e to enter upon the Debate of, <HI>on the Writer's Side</HI>; and a dry barren Subject on the <HI>Reader's Side,</HI> &s;o that in &s;hort, the World began to be &s;ick of reading their tedious Calculations, and mo&s;t People thought they knew little of the Matter.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this, as it often happens in knot|ty and perplex'd Schemes, all the Propo&s;als that I have yet &s;een or heard of, left the Ca&s;e ju&s;t where they found it; or rather, as it is &s;aid of <HI>Job</HI> and his Comfor|ters, <HI>they darkned Coun&s;el with Words without Knowledge</HI>; they &s;aid little but what had been &s;aid before, and the World &s;eemed not one Jot the wi&s;er for all their Pro|jects: The Grievance run on in the old Road of Con|fu&s;ion and Di&s;order, and the poor Seamen were but ju&s;t where they were 30 or 40 Years ago; be&s;ides groaning under additional Abu&s;es and Impo&s;itions, Violences and Injuries, as well private as publick.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Hard&s;hips, the Numbers of Seamen vi&s;ibly declined; and tho&s;e that were left were very hardly, and not without the utmo&s;t Reluctance, brought into the publick Service; and about, as well as a little before the time of the late Revolution, it was a Dif|ficulty not ea&s;y to be got over, to rai&s;e Seamen to Man 30 or 40 Men of War, and not at all without Time.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8">King <HI>William</HI> was very &s;en&s;ible of this, and found the Inconveniencies of it in the very fir&s;t Equipment after the Revolution; &s;ome of the Seamen fled from the Service, in publick Re&s;entment, and on Party Rea|&s;ons; &s;ome li&s;tned to <HI>French</HI> Allurements, and took Pay in the Navies of the Enemy; many fled abroad, and kept out in the Merchants Service, becau&s;e of the Advance of Pay; &s;ome one way, &s;ome another, and &s;ome (too many indeed) unhappily turn'd <HI>Pyrates.</HI></P>
<P>Several Proclamations were publi&s;hed to invite them home, <HI>but to little Purpo&s;e,</HI> &s;ome threatning them with Puni&s;hment if they continued abroad in Foreign Ser|vice, but all with very little Effect; at length they thought of a Method, &s;ince worn out and thread-bare (if you will pardon me that Word) I mean of giving a <HI>Bounty-Money</HI> to the Seamen, by way of Advance, to engage them to come in; at fir&s;t it an&s;wered the End pretty well, and abundance of Seamen bit at the Bait (I won't &s;ay were catch'd upon the Hook) but they were brought into the Service by it.</P>
<P>But as this was but a temporary thing, the Seamen began to make light of it, and that perhaps more than they ought to have done; &s;o that in a few Years the Government found Bounties, and little Advances upon the fir&s;t Entrance of Seamen, did not fully an&s;wer the End, and the Want of Seamen was greatly detrimental to the Service every Year, and e&s;pecially at the fir&s;t &s;it|ting out of the Fleets, the Service calling for more Men every Year than other, for &s;everal Years toge|ther.</P>
<P>It is true, that the Publick at length employing &s;o exceeding great Numbers of Seamen, as well for Winter as Summer-Service, and as well in the Tran&s;|port Service as in the Men of War, the Number in|creas'd, as it were, by the con&s;equence of the Service; &s;o that the War it&s;elf might be &s;aid to breed up its own Seamen; al&s;o the Regiments of Marines &s;erving long on Board, a&s;&s;i&s;ted to this Encrea&s;e, and the
<PB N="6" REF="9">
Soldier &s;erving always on Board the Fleet, became &s;o acquainted with the Sea and with the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of Sailors, that in few Years they dropt off from the Regiments, got their Di&s;charges of their Officers, and entred them&s;elves afore the Ma&s;t. And it was parti|cularly ob&s;erved, that at the end of the War, when tho&s;e Regiments were broke and disbanded, almo&s;t all the Men turn'd Sailors, and entred them&s;elves on Board the Man of War or Merchant Ships, as they could get Employment.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, among the great Number of vagrant un&s;ettled People who entred into the Service, by Vertue of the &s;everal Acts of Parliament made in tho&s;e Reigns, abundance of them proving diligent, and applying them&s;elves to the Work, of which they under&s;tood no|thing before, became able Seamen, and encreas'd the Number of the general <HI>Tar-Fraternity,</HI> &s;o that at la&s;t the Number of Seamen &s;eem'd to be &s;ufficient to the Service, at lea&s;t the Ships were more ea&s;ily Mann'd than before.</P>
<P>Had not this been the Ca&s;e, how could <HI>England</HI> have &s;u&s;tained the lo&s;s of &s;o many thou&s;and Seamen, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have dropt off during the continuance of that tedious, and to the Sailors fateaguing War? I make no doubt but during the Wars with <HI>France,</HI> in the two Reigns of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> a|bove 50000 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen went to the Bottom by Battle, Di&s;ea&s;e and Di&s;a&s;ter. And if other People who pretend to under&s;tand it may judge, I am very much within Compa&s;s in my Calculations.</P>
<P>It is true, Trade &s;uffer'd great Lo&s;&s;es and Convul|&s;ions during tho&s;e Reigns, and in particular met with great Ob&s;truction; &s;o that as the <HI>Navy Royal</HI> employ'd many thou&s;ands of Seamen more than ever before, Trade mo&s;t certainly employ'd fewer Ships, and con|&s;equently fewer Men; Hence the Gro&s;s of the Sea|men were then employ'd, and to the End of that War, in the Royal Navy.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">But as we have liv'd to &s;ee tho&s;e Wars ended, and a Glorious Pacific Interval &s;ucceeding, the <HI>Navy Royal</HI> (&s;ome Squadrons excepted) laid up, and Trade begin|ning to extend it&s;elf abroad, as we &s;hall &s;ee in the Se|quel of this Work; this has again employ'd, &s;catter'd and di&s;per&s;ed the Men. Tho&s;e very Men who in their Ca&s;tles and Wooden Walls were able to HUSH and de|fye the World, are now &s;quandred up and down in private Bu&s;ine&s;s in all the known Parts of the Globe, and that &s;o as not to be ea&s;ily, if ever, collected again into one Body; &s;o that the Number of our Seamen, e&s;pecially as to the publick Service, is greatly dimi|ni&s;h'd and decreas'd.</P>
<P>Some of the &s;everal Articles which have thus de|creas'd the Numbers of Seamen, and by which it is become &s;o difficult to find Men for the publick Ser|vice, are <HI>as follows.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Rate of Wages continuing low in the pub|lick Service, and beginning with the Peace to fall al&s;o in the Merchant Service, has cau&s;ed the Seamen to &s;eek abroad for Service, where they could have bet|ter Wages, or more con&s;tant Employment.</P>
<P N="2">2. To which mu&s;t be added, the Advantages offer'd by Foreign Princes and Powers at the &s;ame juncture of time, to invite our Seamen into their Service; par|ticularly the <HI>Czar</HI> or Emperor of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and the King of <HI>Spain</HI>; the former has, as I am a&s;&s;ur'd, great Numbers of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen, and the latter of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> always in their Service.</P>
<P N="3">3. The tempting Profits of <HI>going upon the Account,</HI> (&s;o our Sailors call that wicked Trade of turning Py|rates) in which horrid Employment (however &s;canda|lous) many thou&s;ands of our Seamen have engag'd &s;ince the late War, mo&s;t of them being of the able&s;t Sea|men, and be&s;t Arti&s;ts that were to be found among them; and by which, be&s;ides the Numbers that re|main, abundance have been lo&s;t to their Country by <HI>Shipwreck,</HI> by <HI>Battles,</HI> by the <HI>Gallows,</HI> by <HI>Starving,</HI> and
<PB N="8" REF="11">
other Di&s;tre&s;&s;es natural to tho&s;e de&s;perate Adventures; &s;o that this al&s;o has been a great Cau&s;e of the Decrea&s;e of the Numbers of Seamen among us, and will con|tinue to be &s;o, unle&s;s &s;ome Remedy may be found out to reduce them, and re&s;tore them to the Service and Intere&s;t of their Country.</P>
<P>But this leads me al&s;o to a popular and more ac|ceptable way of calculating this Deficiency of Num|bers among our Seamen, and that is, that our Trade is happily encreas'd and extended &s;ince the pro&s;pe|rous Reign of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and his Royal Prede|ce&s;&s;or, by which the Merchants of <HI>Great Britain</HI> main|tain and employ an extraordinary Number of Seamen more than ever was call'd for by Trade before; &s;o that at the &s;ame time that the Royal Navy cea&s;es to employ Marines and raw Men, by which to encrea&s;e the Num|ber, the Merchants require more Men by many thou|&s;ands, not only than they did during the War, but than ever they did before the War, in the Times of the mo&s;t profound Tranquility of Affairs: This ren|ders the Number of Seamen le&s;s, in regard to the Ser|vice, whether they are numerically fewer in Tale or no; for as every Number is great or &s;mall compa|ratively, &s;o it is here; if there were 200000 Seamen in <HI>England,</HI> yet if the Demand for them calls for more, they are then few, compared to that Demand, or compar'd to the Service they are demanded for, tho' their Number was more than had been ever known before.</P>
<P>This Encrea&s;e of our Demand for Seamen is the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and it is indeed in it&s;elf a very con&s;i|derable Article, if the Fact be true, <HI>and of that I &s;hall &s;peak pre&s;ently by it&s;elf</HI>; I &s;ay it is very con&s;ide|rable, for tho' our Seamen were not dimini&s;h'd or de|crea&s;ed by any of the Occa&s;ions mention'd above, yet if the Demand for Seamen, and e&s;pecially the De|mands of Trade, which lye in &s;everal di&s;tant and re|mote Places, are encreas'd, the Number at hand for the publick Service of their Country is le&s;s in propor|tion
<PB N="9" REF="12">
to the Occa&s;ion than it was before. <HI>For Example</HI>:</P>
<P>If the Encrea&s;e of our Commerce and Shipping is evident, more Seamen are con&s;equently wanting to carry on that Commerce and man tho&s;e Ships; &s;o that Trade employing the Men, and the Merchants giving better Wages than the King, <HI>which by the way is a Fault,</HI> they will be more ea&s;ily &s;upplied, and the pub|lick Service be in greater want of Hands than be|fore, tho' the Number of Seamen were the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It would indeed require a long Excur&s;ion here to demon&s;trate that Trade is &s;o encreas'd in <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI> and that the Merchants do call for and enter|tain more Seamen than they did, not only during the late War, but in the times of the profounde&s;t Peace; yet &s;omething mu&s;t be &s;aid to it, el&s;e we &s;hall be &s;aid to beg the Que&s;tion, which in a thing of &s;uch Im|portance I can by no means admit, but the Digre&s;&s;ion &s;hall be very &s;hort.</P>
<P>I think it mu&s;t be allow'd that &s;ince the late War there is a happy Encrea&s;e of Commerce carry'd on by the Subjects of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in &s;everal Parts of the World, and by which great Numbers of Seamen are call'd for, more than were before, not only in time of War, but even in times of the mo&s;t &s;ettled Peace; for example,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Greenland</HI> Fi&s;hery is a fair, open, and con|fe&s;t Addition to our Trade, and by which a con&s;iderable Number of Seamen are employ'd, where not a Man was employ'd before; and more are like to be call'd for every Year, as that Trade goes on.</P>
<P N="2">2. The White Fi&s;hery at <HI>Newfound-land,</HI> &s;ince by the late Peace the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that I&s;land was con|ceded to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> is very con&s;iderably encreas'd; and be&s;ides the Numbers of Ve&s;&s;els and of able Sea|men, who remain upon the Spot all the Winter, to carry on the Salmon Fi&s;hing on Shore, and the Banking Fi&s;hery in the Spring; we are a&s;&s;ured there are above 100 Sail of Ships yearly employ'd there, and by that
<PB N="10" REF="13">
Trade, more than ever were before; by both which Articles we may allow 2000 Seamen to be yearly wanted more in Trade than were before, even in Time of the mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd Tranquility.</P>
<P N="3">3. The like Addition is vi&s;ible to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fi&s;h|ing on the Northern Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> the Coa&s;t of <HI>Accadia,</HI> and the North Shores of <HI>New-England,</HI> mo&s;t of which were po&s;&s;e&s;t, or at lea&s;t di&s;turb'd, before by the <HI>French</HI>; whereas now the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>New-Engli&s;h</HI> Fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els, Ships and Seamen are fully and freely employ'd on all tho&s;e Coa&s;ts, and drive a very con&s;i|derable Trade, with the Fi&s;h they take, to <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> in which Places no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, or but few, were employ'd before; likewi&s;e more Ships in Propor|tion are employ'd by them to fetch Salt for that Fi&s;hery.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Trade of our Colonies is vi&s;ibly encreas'd, and con&s;equently their Shipping; as particularly the Addition of the <HI>French</HI> Part of the I&s;land of St. <HI>Chri|&s;topbers,</HI> being now become <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> is &s;o encreas'd in its Produce, and by that in its Inhabitants and Trade, that they &s;end near as many Ships and as many Hog&s;heads of Sugar yearly to <HI>England,</HI> as the I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> it&s;elf, and mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity employ &s;o many the more Sloops and Ships to furni&s;h them with Provi&s;ions from the Colonies on the Continent, than they did before, and in all tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els the greater Number of Seamen are al&s;o annually employ'd, where few were employ'd before.</P>
<P N="5">5. The vi&s;ible Encrea&s;e of the <HI>Jamaica</HI> Trade, and of the Number of Ships employ'd in it, within a few Years pa&s;t; this cannot be deny'd. The <HI>South-Sea</HI> Commerce, by the <HI>A&s;&s;iento,</HI> is al&s;o a farther Encrea&s;e of it, mo&s;t of that Trade being carry'd on from <HI>Africa</HI> to the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies,</HI> by way of <HI>Jamaica.</HI> I leave that to be adju&s;ted by the Merchants, and by any &s;uch as have liv'd upon the I&s;land any time, and knew what Number of Ships were formerly employ'd in it. Some, who are fully acquainted with the Trade
<PB N="11" REF="14">
of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> a&s;&s;ure me upon a &s;erious Enquiry into this Part, that there are above 100 Sail of Ships yearly, <HI>and mo&s;t of them Ships of Force,</HI> which are con|&s;tantly employ'd in the Trade between <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> including &s;uch Ships as go by the way of <HI>Madera</HI> with Wines, and by the way of <HI>Africa</HI> with Negroes, more than were u&s;ually employ'd in that Trade before; not including in this Number the great Num|ber of Ships and Sloops, employ'd between that I&s;land, and the Colonies on the North Part of <HI>America</HI> upon the Continent, who&s;e chief Bu&s;ine&s;s is carrying Provi|&s;ions of all kind.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>We had an Account printed here lately, of be|tween forty and fifty Sail of Ships come to</HI> Jamaica <HI>in about two Months upon the&s;e Accounts; only one &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el of them of forty Ton coming directly from</HI> England.</P>
<P>It might be to the Purpo&s;e al&s;o, to &s;hew how our Trade is encreas'd to almo&s;t all our other Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> and e&s;pecially to <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>Carolina,</HI> &s;ince the Encouragement given to the bringing Naval Stores, Tar, Turpentine, Rice, and &s;uch like things from thence; of which, e&s;pecially the Tar and Rice, very little was imported in former times.</P>
<P>Al&s;o we might mention the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, in which, in&s;tead of five or &s;ix Ships abroad at a time, there are now forty to fifty Ships con&s;tantly abroad together; and tho' the Ships are not quite &s;o large, yet they carry very near as many Men, and a great many more are employ'd in the Country on the Ships made u&s;e of from one Factory to another.</P>
<P>The Sum of all this is to demon&s;trate, that there are without doubt more Seamen call'd for in Trade, and employ'd by the Merchants on Board their Ships, than were before; and that as tho&s;e are made u&s;e of in remote and di&s;tant Places in the World, they may at lea&s;t be reckon'd as &s;o many lo&s;t Men to the pub|lick Service, becau&s;e they cannot be recall'd and re|&s;tor'd to the Service upon any &s;udden Emergence;
<PB N="12" REF="15">
and indeed not at all, without giving a deep and &s;en|&s;ible Blow to our Commerce, and weakening the In|tre&s;t of Trade in general.</P>
<P>Any Propo&s;als then for the <HI>Encrea&s;e</HI> or <HI>Encourage|ment</HI> of Seamen, ought to be &s;uppo&s;ed calculated for &s;uch an Encrea&s;e, as &s;hall bring up the Number of Seamen, to be equal to the Demand as well of the Public as of the Commerce. Otherwi&s;e, to encourage the Seamen and not &s;o to encrea&s;e their Number, is do|ing nothing, but encouraging them to quit the Mer|chants Service, and enter into the King's Service; which, as to the Nation in general, may be &s;aid to be like a Man taking Money out of one Pocket and put|ting it into another; with this Addition too, that it wounds one Part to heal another. For Trade and the Publick, in this Article, are like a Body under two contrary Operations, where if you heal one Di&s;ea&s;e, you revive another, &s;o that &s;till the Patient is oppre&s;s'd on one hand or other.</P>
<P>But to encrea&s;e the Number of Seamen to &s;uch a Degree, that there &s;hall always be a &s;ufficient Supply for all the Services which may call for them, whether for Trade or for Defence, whether for Peace or War; that taking them on this &s;ide, &s;hould not le&s;&s;en them on that; and that every Want might be &s;upply'd; this would be the true, and, I may &s;ay, the only effectual way of encrea&s;ing them.</P>
<P>But who is &s;ufficient for &s;uch an Undertaking, and how &s;hall we find a Scheme equal to the Difficulty? If there is not a &s;ufficient Number of Seamen to &s;upply every Exigence, whether of Trade or War, then when the Demand lyes on one hand, the other mu&s;t &s;uffer by the dead Weight running again&s;t it. If the Navy Royal is to be man'd, immediately Embar|goes are laid, Pre&s;s-Warrants are i&s;&s;ued out, the Na|tion is rummag'd for Seamen, by which it is alledged that abundance of injurious Violence is made u&s;e of, to bring them in, out of the Merchant's Service; and &s;o
<PB N="13" REF="16">
Trade &s;uffers. On the other hand, if in time of Peace Trade calls out for Seamen, the poor Sailors are fully employed and carried away to all Parts of the World, and every Skipper's Demand is &s;upply'd, while his Maje&s;ty's Navy is left naked, and liable to be in&s;ulted for want of Hands.</P>
<P>And who &s;hall reconcile the&s;e Contraries, or joyn the&s;e Extremes? There &s;eems to be an in&s;uperable Difficulty in it; for if you will encrea&s;e the Hands, you mu&s;t find them Work, or maintain them idle.</P>
<P>The Seamen are but one Species, and are wanted but upon two extraordinary Occa&s;ions; in Peace the King has no Occa&s;ion for them, the Merchants mu&s;t em|ploy them, or they &s;tarve: In War the King mu&s;t have them, or the Service is &s;tarv'd; and if the King takes them, the Merchant &s;tands &s;till, and the Trade &s;tarves: If they are encrea&s;ed to a Number equal to both <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>War,</HI> then, unle&s;s you have always a War, the Seamen are too many for the Merchants, and if they are not equal to both, then, in time of War, the Merchants are too many for the Seamen, becau&s;e the Government will be &s;erv'd, and takes them by force.</P>
<P>This makes a kind of a Struggle between Trade and the Government. The Government u&s;es Force, and takes the Seamen by Impre&s;s and Arre&s;t; the Merchants u&s;e a Force al&s;o, tho' of a different Kind, and that is the Force of Per&s;ua&s;ion, I mean the powerful Per|&s;ua&s;ion of Money, giving higher Wagers; and as they are always in a Condition to out-bid the Publick, they leave it to the Seamen to avoid the Impre&s;s, and keep out of the Hands of the Government as well as they can; and they do not, generally &s;peaking, want Stra|tagems to &s;ecure them&s;elves, for all Men will &s;erve tho&s;e they can get mo&s;t Money by.</P>
<P>Now to reconcile all the&s;e Difficulties, <HI>is the Ca&s;e before us.</HI> I have indeed &s;een very little offer'd towards it in the World; the thing &s;eems to have &s;omething
<PB N="14" REF="17">
Impracticable in it. The King's Speech, with all Duty and Regard to his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on and Expre&s;&s;ions, mentions indeed the Importance of it, but recommends it to his People, to con&s;ider of the Method. It can be no Offence, I hope, to His Maje&s;ty or to the Par|liament, to make an E&s;&s;ay at that without doors, which His Maje&s;ty him&s;elf recommends as a thing of the ut|mo&s;t Importance; and well worth their Con&s;idera|tion within doors.</P>
<P>To &s;peak then to that Fir&s;t which His Maje&s;ty fir&s;t mentions, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Encrea&s;e</HI> of the Seamen: I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that to encrea&s;e the Number of Seamen with|out finding them Employment, would be to bring a Rent-Charge upon the Nation, like a Work-hou&s;e full of Poor, with nothing for them to do.</P>
<P>How to have a Number of Seamen &s;ufficient for War and Trade together, &s;eems to me to be the Que&s;tion; and the An&s;wer &s;eems to be as natural, <HI>viz,</HI> that it is an Incon&s;i&s;tency in it&s;elf, that it cannot be done; that as, in time of War, the Publick entertains and employs fifty or &s;ixty thou&s;and Seamen, and in time of Peace none at all, that is to &s;ay very few; how is it po&s;&s;ible Trade &s;hould either have Men enough in time of War, or not too many in time of Peace.</P>
<P>Even His Maje&s;ty's Speech does not propo&s;e it; the King recommends it to his Parliament, to con&s;ider of Ways to <HI>encourage</HI> the Seamen, &s;o that they may willingly and by Choice enter into the Service of their Country, and without being forc'd in. But, with humble&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion to his Maje&s;ty, I would ask leave to propo&s;e a Difficulty here: From whence mu&s;t they come to Enter into the Service of their Country? They mu&s;t either be in Employment be|fore, or out of it.</P>
<P>If they are out of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and refu&s;e or decline the Publick Service, they are in a Fault, and de&s;erve Puni&s;hment; or, to &s;ay no more, de&s;erve to be brought in by force; for the Seamen, as they are a People
<PB N="15" REF="18">
nece&s;&s;ary to the Safety of the Publick, are, as it were, actually the Government's Servants, by the nature of the thing; and 'tis upon that Foot that they can be Impre&s;s'd by Warrant, as Phy&s;icians and Surgeons may be commanded by Authority to perform the Duty of their Profe&s;&s;ion, and may not only be obliged to it, but puni&s;h'd for refu&s;ing it.</P>
<P>On the other hand; if they are in Employment, it mu&s;t be in the Service of Private Per&s;ons, that is to &s;ay, in the Merchants Service, in the Collieries, the Fi&s;heries, the Coa&s;ting, or &s;ome other Trade, which requires their Labour, and gives them good Pay.</P>
<P>To prevail with, or per&s;uade the Sailors to quit this Bu&s;ine&s;s, and enter freely into the Service of their Country, there &s;eems to be but one Way that I can &s;ee; no Encouragement but Money, better Wages, and le&s;s Work, will weigh with any of them; and I doubt it is hard to find any other Medium. And this mu&s;t fall heavy upon the Merchant, becau&s;e what is gain'd by the Navy, I doubt, mu&s;t be lo&s;t by the Trade, and you take with the one Hand what you give with the other.</P>
<P>The Propo&s;al to Encrea&s;e the Number of Seamen, &s;eems to point at bringing more and greater Numbers of Seamen into the Cla&s;s, to breed up or introduce more than are ordinarily &s;o brought up to the Sea, of which I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething very particular in its Place.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's Speech &s;eems to intimate that the Ca&s;e is difficult, and therefore offers at a Medium, by joyning the Parts together, to <HI>Encrea&s;e</HI> them, and to <HI>Encourage</HI> them; by encrea&s;ing their Number, the Navy may be &s;ure of a Supply on an Exigence; and by encouraging them, that Number might be &s;o di&s;pos'd of that they might not &s;tarve one another, or be a Burthen to the Nation. And thus indeed His Maje&s;ty has as it were led us by the Hand to the Remedy, however difficult.</P>
<P>Having thus touch'd upon the two main Heads, <HI>viz. Encrea&s;e of the Number of Seamen,</HI> and <HI>Encouraging them</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="19">
<HI>to Enter</HI> into the Service of their Country, I come to take them a little in Pieces, and &s;tate the Ca&s;e between them all.</P>
<P N="1">1. I would &s;tate the Ca&s;e between the Seamen and the Publick, and enquire (if po&s;&s;ible) whether the Sea|men are at pre&s;ent under any Hard&s;hips with re&s;pect to the publick Service; what tho&s;e Hard&s;hips are; and what Redre&s;s can be thought of to do Ju&s;tice and Right between them and their Country.</P>
<P N="2">2. I would &s;tate the Ca&s;e between the Navy Service, and the Commerce, and enquire whether it is not po&s;|&s;ible to do &s;omething for the Encrea&s;e of the Seamen, which may be con&s;i&s;tent with the publick Service, and yet be not fatally injurious to the Seamen them&s;elves, or to the Trade.</P>
<P>N. B. <HI>Pray take it with you as you go, that I &s;ay not fatally Prejudicial, for I allow it is impo&s;&s;ible but Trade mu&s;t &s;uffer; but the Bu&s;ine&s;s is to have Trade duly con&s;idered, and its Intere&s;t regarded &s;o, that Trade may &s;uffer as little as may be, and yet the Publick Service may be duly attended; and perhaps I may find out &s;ome way to reconcile the&s;e Difficulties.</HI></P>
<P>A skilful Surgeon being called to a difficult Opera|tion in the cour&s;e of his Profe&s;&s;ion, is careful fir&s;t of the Patient's Safety, that's the main Article; to pre&s;erve which, his Bu&s;ine&s;s is to go on in a regular manner with his Work, and perform the nece&s;&s;ary Part according to Art.</P>
<P>But after this, his great Concern is to put the Patient (if po&s;&s;ible) to no Extremities; he knows he mu&s;t bear a great deal of Pain, Lo&s;s of Blood, and Decay of Strength, but his Care is to put him to as little Pain as he can, con&s;i&s;tent with the Cure; be it the Amputation of a Member, the Openings and Inci&s;ions of Lythotomy, the Cuttings and Scarifications needful in Mortifica|tions, Gangreens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or any other de&s;perate Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>In like manner, with re&s;pect to the Seamen; in Ca&s;e of a War, the Royal Navy mu&s;t be mann'd; perhaps
<PB N="17" REF="20">
an Inva&s;ion is threatned, or the Enemy is fitting out a powerful Fleet, we are not to &s;tand debating about Right and Wrong; the Seamen mu&s;t be had; you mu&s;t take them where-ever you can find them; in &s;uch Ca&s;es Trade may be a great Sufferer. But now as Trade is an important Article, and no wi&s;e Government &s;hews them|&s;elves unconcern'd about it, or willing to oppre&s;s and injure the Merchant in their Trade, where it can be avoided; &s;o it is an Enquiry of ju&s;t Concern to us all, to &s;ee what can be done in &s;uch Ca&s;es of Extremity to &s;erve the Government, and yet to oppre&s;s and in|jure Trade and the Merchant as little as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>And why may not &s;ome happy Medium be found out for this critical Ca&s;e? Let every Man ca&s;t his Mite into the Che&s;t; Who knows but &s;omething to the Purpo&s;e may be &s;aid, where you do not expect it, even perhaps where you do not de&s;ire to find it?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A farther State of the Seamen's Ca&s;e: With an Enquiry, Whether it is not po&s;&s;ible to do &s;omething for the Encrea&s;e of the Seamen, which may be con&s;i&s;tent with the Publick Service, and yet not fatally injurious to the Seamen them&s;elves, or to the Trade.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE I enter too far into the Debate, as I have &s;tated it, I de&s;ire to make a needful Explana|tion of Terms, that I may not be mi&s;under&s;tood, &s;tum|ble at the Thre&s;hold, and open the Door to the Cavils and Impertinencies of the Times.</P>
<P>In order to this, I lay it down as a <HI>Po&s;tulatum,</HI> That when I &s;ay the Seamen do labour under Hard&s;hips in the Publick Service, I am not to be under&s;tood as
<PB N="18" REF="21">
if I thought they were injured, u&s;ed ill, oppre&s;s'd, wrong'd, or anywi&s;e injuriou&s;ly treated, in Con&s;equence of the Service. They may indeed be u&s;ed ill, oppre&s;s'd, wrong'd, and injuriou&s;ly treated by this or that parti|cular Officer, or in this or that particular Ship; and I may take the Freedom to &s;peak of that Part too, in its Place. But I am now &s;peaking of the Hard&s;hips &s;uf|fered by the Seamen in general, and by the meer natu|ral Con&s;equence of the Service in general; and the&s;e may be call'd Hard&s;hips, I hope, without Offence; becau&s;e tho' it may be in the Power of the Publick to remove &s;ome of tho&s;e Hard&s;hips, yet we cannot com|plain of them as the Act and Deed of the pre&s;ent Ad|mini&s;tration, or lay them to the Charge of any parti|cular Per&s;on. <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Seamen employ'd in the Publick Service are in the &s;ame Condition, with re&s;pect to their Pay, and other Provi&s;ions, which they were in 50 or 60 Years ago; whereas they are not in the &s;ame Condition, with re&s;pect to Sub&s;i&s;ting on that Pay, as they were in at that time; and if this Difference is &s;uch, that they cannot really &s;ub&s;i&s;t on their Pay at this time, tho' they could &s;ub&s;i&s;t on it at that time, of not &s;o well, then they are under more Hard&s;hips than the Seamen were 50 or 60 Years ago.</P>
<P>We are told, how true I cannot particularly learn, or know how to enquire, that the Pay of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen on board the Royal Navy, in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, was after the Rate of Seven Shil|lings to Nine Shillings <HI>per</HI> Month; that afterwards in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time, the Rate was rais'd up to E|leven Shillings, and afterwards to Thirteen Shillings <HI>per</HI> Month. I refer the Enquirer to the proper Regi|&s;ters of tho&s;e Times, by which any Mi&s;take in tho&s;e Particulars may be rectified; tho' it is not material if it was not ju&s;t &s;o much to a Shilling or two, more or le&s;s, the Fact in the gro&s;s is, that their Wages was con&s;ide|rably le&s;s, and that is enough to my Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="22">But it is an&s;wered, and I allow the An&s;wer to be good, That if the Sailor was as well able to live and &s;ub&s;i&s;t his Family, furni&s;h him&s;elf with Cloaths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with Eleven to Thirteen Shillings <HI>per</HI> Month then, as he was with Twenty-three Shillings <HI>per</HI> Month in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Time, then Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> gave as good Wages as King <HI>Charles</HI> II. But then, by the &s;ame Rule, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, that if the Wages had continued at the &s;ame Standard of Queen <HI>Eliza|beth</HI>'s Pay, to the time of <HI>Charles</HI> II, the Way of Living, and the Sub&s;i&s;tence of the poor Men and their Families, being rai&s;ed and made different, as we know they were, the Seamen would have been under a Hard|&s;hip that mu&s;t have been un&s;ufferable; &s;ince 'tis a known Maxim in Bu&s;ine&s;s of all Kinds, That the Pay of the Labouring Poor, whether Seamen or Landmen, mu&s;t always bear a Proportion to the Rate of Living, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> to the Price of Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>To bring this down to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e: The Sea|men in <HI>England</HI> have here an evident Di&s;advantage, e&s;|pecially tho&s;e of them who &s;erve in the Royal Navy; and it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a great Di&s;couragement to the Service it&s;elf, as well as to the Seamen: Their Pay in the Royal Navy is (not to call it &s;mall) no more now than it was as far back as the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. namely twenty-three Shillings <HI>per</HI> Month for able Seamen, and Eighteen Shillings <HI>per</HI> Month for the inferior Sort, that is able-bodied, but unexperienc'd Men; and the Times being changed, and the Rate of Provi&s;ions and other Nece&s;&s;aries for the Sub&s;i&s;tence of Families be|ing rai&s;ed, and that to a very great Degree, this Pay is le&s;s &s;ufficient to their Maintenance than it formerly was, e&s;|pecially to &s;uch of them as have Families on Shore to &s;upport, and tho&s;e indeed are the Men who are the mo&s;t to be depended upon for the Service; the&s;e are anxious for their Wives and Children, carefully &s;ave and re|&s;erve their Wages for their Supply, and the&s;e merit on that Account the Encouragement I am &s;peaking of.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="23">Now the Support and Sub&s;i&s;tence of the&s;e Families is greatly le&s;&s;ened &s;ince the Times mentioned above, when they had twenty-three Shillings <HI>per</HI> Month Wa|ges as well as now, by the exceeding Dearne&s;s of Hou&s;e-keeping, and of almo&s;t all nece&s;&s;ary things for a Family, above what it formerly was.</P>
<P>This Advance of the Price of Provi&s;ions, Cloathing, and almo&s;t all nece&s;&s;ary things, is too evident to be di&s;puted; the Cau&s;es of it, at lea&s;t &s;ome of them, are known and felt by us all; and many poor Families groan (I do not &s;ay repine) under the weight of them; &s;uch as the Taxes, and Funds e&s;tabli&s;h'd on tho&s;e Taxes, and by which they are bound down upon us for ma|ny Years, upon Coals, Candles, Soap, Malt, Salt, Lea|ther, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The New Cu&s;toms and Impo&s;ts upon Imported Commodities, and particularly &s;uch as are u&s;e|ful in Families, &s;uch as Oil, Linnen, Fruit, Sugar, Spice, Tobacco, Brandy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The additional Exci&s;es upon Beer, Ale, Malt, Spirits, and other Liquors. The fir&s;t of the&s;e are things nece&s;&s;ary to their Families at home, and the La&s;t to the poor Men them&s;elves, when on board the Men of War; mo&s;t of which Taxes and Duties, and others not named, are of modern Standing, and were not known, or &s;o much as named in the &s;aid Times of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. when yet the Wages of Seamen was as great (the &s;ame) as it is now.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of the poor Seamen &s;eems harder in the&s;e Par|ticulars than that of any other Cla&s;s of the People, from the Nature of their Employment, which is always a|broad: Other Poor are not &s;eparated from their Mother Soil; the&s;e labour in a comfortle&s;s, unproducing Ele|ment: The poor Seamen neither Sow or Reap, Breed or Feed, Plant or Gather, &s;o that they have no A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Product of the Earth, as the poor Landmen generally have; the Sea yields nothing to|wards the Maintenance or Support of Life, but Fi&s;h and Salt, the &s;malle&s;t Article in an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI>'s Food, and
<PB N="21" REF="24">
which will go but a very little way in his Family; all he has he mu&s;t buy with his Money; and &s;o many ne|ce&s;&s;ary Kinds of his Supply being thus heavily load|ed with Taxes, tho&s;e Taxes fall harder upon him than upon any other Cla&s;s of the Poor whatever.</P>
<P>The poor Cottager and Labourer can glean his Corn, brew his Beer, rai&s;e his Poultry, keep a Cow upon the Common, and a Hog in his Yard, can Dig and Trench in a little Enclo&s;ure for his Vegetables, gather and cut his Fewel on the Heaths and in the Woods: But the poor Seaman buys all with dead Money, gain'd at the Hazard of his Life, and lay'd out with all the Di&s;|advantage imaginable; Things all di&s;couraging enough, and which render him an Object of our ju&s;t Concern; and as he is a u&s;eful nece&s;&s;ary Servant of his Country, his Ca&s;e not only moves our Compa&s;&s;ion, but &s;eems to claim that he &s;hould have all rea&s;onable Helps to en|courage his Services, and to keep him in heart, that he may go on cheerfully in the important Bu&s;ine&s;s he is bred up to.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Differences and Di&s;advantages in their Ex|pences, if we may not &s;ay the Seamen have a Hard&s;hip, we may at lea&s;t allow they have a very great Di&s;cou|ragement; particularly, they are &s;traitned, and kept low and poor by the Encrea&s;e of their Expence, having not at the &s;ame time any Encrea&s;e of Pay. And this may be a&s;&s;ign'd as a true Rea&s;on, or at lea&s;t as one of the Rea&s;ons, why they are &s;ometimes backward to en|ter into the Service of their Country when they are called upon to come in Voluntier, on any Publick Oc|ca&s;ions, having not Money wherewith to fit and fur|ni&s;h them&s;elves out, that is to &s;ay, to &s;upply them&s;elves with Cloaths, Bedding, and other Nece&s;&s;aries to cover them in a cold Climate, or to comfort them in a hot, and for want of which many Seamen (e&s;pecially &s;uch as have been pre&s;&s;ed into the Service, and on that Ac|count not entitled to the Bounty of the Government) have &s;uffered great Extremities by the Severities of the
<PB N="22" REF="25">
Sea&s;ons, and the Inclemency of the Climates, either &s;uch as extreme Cold, or exce&s;&s;ive Heats, as the Ser|vice may have pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>This Poverty, and the&s;e Hard&s;hips in the Circum|&s;tances of the Seamen, has been partly the Occa&s;ion that has mov'd the generous Compa&s;&s;ion of our Prin|ces, on many Occa&s;ions, to publi&s;h Bounties, and pro|mi&s;e Money to be advanced to them for their Supply, to encourage them to come voluntarily in, and enter them&s;elves on board the Royal Navy; and it has not been without its de&s;ired Effect in part, tho' not to &s;uch a Degree as was at fir&s;t expected. The Rea&s;ons for which we &s;hall &s;ee farther into pre&s;ently; but in the mean time, it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. That this very Grant of Bounty, which, if I mi&s;take not, was fir&s;t directed by the late Glorious King <HI>William,</HI> a Prince eminent for his Knowledge and Expe|rience in the true Methods of managing the Marine Service, was a Te&s;timony to the Truth of what I have alledg'd, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Poverty and Exigence of the Sea|men at their fir&s;t entering into the Service; and that this Exigence con&s;i&s;ted, as above, in their want of Money to furni&s;h them&s;elves with Nece&s;&s;aries at their &s;etting out.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Exigence being prov'd, as to the Fact of it, the Ju&s;tice of con&s;idering the poor Seamen, and be&s;tow|ing a Royal Bounty for their Encouragement, &s;eems to be tacitly acknowledg'd al&s;o; or if we mu&s;t not call it Ju&s;tice, but rather a Charity, for the Words Boun|ty and Ju&s;tice &s;eem to cla&s;h a little; yet then, the Rea|&s;onablene&s;s of the Charity &s;eems evident, and the Di|&s;tre&s;s moving; &s;o that it is as much, almo&s;t, as to ac|knowledge that there was a Nece&s;&s;ity to do &s;omething for them, or that it could not be expected they would come voluntarily into the Service.</P>
<P>The Effect indeed &s;hew'd that this was the Ca&s;e, for upon the publi&s;hing &s;uch a Benevolence, the Sea|men, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of them as had kept off upon

that very Foundation, began to come freely in, and the Navy felt the Benefit of it, by &s;aving very much the Expence of Pre&s;&s;ing; for impre&s;&s;ing Seamen to the Service, that is, as his Maje&s;ty is plea&s;ed to expre&s;s it, <HI>Compelling them by Force and Violence</HI> to enter into it, is not only grievous to the Seamen, but very expen|&s;ive, as well as tedious to the Publick.</P>
<P>It is Expen&s;ive by the incident Charges attending it, employing Officers and Gangs of Men to range about City and Country to pick Men up; Pre&s;s-Smacks, or Ve&s;&s;els to lye in the Rivers, and proper Ports to re|ceive the Men when Pre&s;s'd; attending the Commi&s;|&s;ioners appointed to hear and redre&s;s Grievances when Men are impre&s;s'd, who by Law ought not to be taken, and the Charge of Maintaining &s;uch Men 'till they are legally Di&s;charged by the Commi&s;&s;ioners; &s;ending Sloops, Smacks, and &s;ometimes Frigates, to pick up Men upon all the remote&s;t Coa&s;ts of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who&s;e Expences are very con&s;iderable, as well on board tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els as on Shore for the Pre&s;&s;ing Work.</P>
<P>Add to all this, the Length of time, which &s;ometimes the Capital Ships are oblig'd to wait before they are ready for the Service, for want of their Complement of Men; and &s;ometimes the whole Fleet has been de|lay'd, and the Service interrupted, for want of &s;uch and &s;uch Ships (who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance they could not &s;afely want) being &s;ufficiently mann'd.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Things had their Share among the Rea|&s;ons for granting the Bounty-money to the Seamen. But to bring it all back to its true Original, all tho&s;e Rea&s;ons are fir&s;t founded upon the nece&s;&s;itous Circum|&s;tance of the Seamen, occca&s;ion'd as above, by the Di&s;|parity between their Pay and their Wants; or if you will, between the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tance of the poor Men, and their pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Nor are the Taxes, mention'd above, the only Cau&s;e of the Dearne&s;s of poor Families Sub&s;i&s;tence; we may appeal to Experience, whether it is not occa&s;ion'd al&s;o by
<PB N="24" REF="27">
the real Encrea&s;e of People among us, or the Encrea&s;e of Commerce, or from a greater Cau&s;e than both, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Luxurious way of Living, which Cu&s;tom and the Pride of the Age has introduced among us, by which the Con&s;umption of Provi&s;ions being encrea&s;ed, the Rate of Provi&s;ion ri&s;es by the mere con&s;equence of that Con&s;umption; but be it which it will, if the Fact is true the Thing is the &s;ame: let us appeal to Expe|riences. The Rate of almo&s;t all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions are, and have been for many Years pa&s;t, exceedingly advanced; &s;o that a Family, whether great or &s;mall, whether Rich or Poor, are not maintain'd, fed, or cloathed upon the &s;ame Terms, and at the &s;ame Ex|pence as formerly they were.</P>
<P>If this be the Ca&s;e then, as the Rate of Wages to the Poor ever did, and we may &s;ay, ever will, ri&s;e or fall in Proportion to the Rate of Provi&s;ions at the Mar|ket: if the Poor Seaman's Wages is but the &s;ame that it was before, may he not be &s;aid to have a Hard&s;hip in this, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that, as we &s;ay, he has not Neighbour's Fare, he can gain no more, and yet mu&s;t &s;pend much more than he did before.</P>
<P>As to the Wages of other labouring Poor, I believe it may be prov'd, that almo&s;t in all kinds of Labour the Poor have rai&s;ed their Price upon us: In the Country, or Husbandry-work, we find it &s;o; in La|bourers, in Journey-men's Wages of almo&s;t all kinds it is &s;o, and the Works they fini&s;h are rai&s;ed in Propor|tion. It would be too tedious to make the Enquiry ge|neral in this Place: I appeal to the Knowledge of Trade&s;men, every one in their own way; I appeal to the Knowledge of Gentlemen in the Wages of their Servants, and in particular to the Ladies, in the Wages of their Maid-&s;ervants, Cooks, Waiting-women, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Advance of which is &s;uch, that 'tis ri&s;en up al|mo&s;t to a Common Grievance.</P>
<P>Does it not &s;eem &s;omewhat hard that all our Servants &s;hould have their Wages advanced, their Support and
<PB N="25" REF="28">
Sub&s;i&s;tence con&s;idered; but the poor Seamen who, we may &s;ay, are the Nation's Servants, and indeed their be&s;t Servants, had no &s;uch Advances made them in Price, however the Nece&s;&s;aries of their Sub&s;i&s;tence are advanc'd, and however heavy that Advance may lye up|on them?</P>
<P>There are other Di&s;couragements upon the poor Men be&s;ides the&s;e, and which, tho' not immediately re&s;pecting the Government, yet as they are in the Power of the Government to redre&s;s, and that His Maje&s;ty has been plea&s;ed to recommend the Encou|raging the Seamen in General to the Parliament, I can|not but think it a dutiful Concurrence with that Re|commendation, and hope it will be &s;o taken, for a pri|vate Hand to lay open &s;ome of tho&s;e Di&s;couragements, for the &s;pecial Cogni&s;ance of the Hou&s;e, in order to pave the way to that Encouragement and Relief which the Hou&s;e may think fit to give them, the poor Seamen.</P>
<P>One natural Con&s;equence of the Di&s;parity, as above, between the Pay or Wages of the Seamen, and their nece&s;&s;ary Expence for Sub&s;i&s;tence, is, that they are often &s;omething Nece&s;&s;itous; and, generally &s;peaking, the Seamen, e&s;pecially &s;uch as have Families, and &s;erve in the Navy-Royal at 23 <HI>s. per</HI> Month, with all the Deductions and Defalcations attending it, are not very rich.</P>
<P>If they were &s;o before, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. when 23 <HI>s.</HI> would go &s;o much farther in the providing for the Food and Cloaths of a Fami|ly, than it will now, it may be allow'd that they mu&s;t be &s;o now; nay, if it mu&s;t be allow'd, that all Things nece&s;&s;ary to Life and the Sub&s;i&s;tence of a Family are &s;o exalted in Price, the poor Seamen mu&s;t be, in the Con&s;equence, ju&s;t &s;o much impoveri&s;h'd and reduced as that Inequality amounts to.</P>
<P>Taking it for granted then, that the Seaman having a Family to provide for while he &s;erves in the Navy, is reduced as above; let us enquire a little into &s;ome of
<PB N="26" REF="29">
the Con&s;equences of this Poverty, for there are many, and tho&s;e very di&s;couraging.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Di&s;couragement is touch'd at already, <HI>namely,</HI> Declining the Service, with-drawing him&s;elf either into the Merchants Service, or, which is wor&s;e, the Devil's Service, and turning Pyrate, plundering our Ships and Merchants, and &s;etting up for a &s;ort of Ma|rine <HI>Highway-men</HI> to make his Fortune by Rapine, or revolting from Duty, and entring into the Ser|vice of the Enemy.</P>
<P>This &s;candalous Employment has indeed recommen|ded &s;o many of them to the Gallows, that the Num|bers of them &s;eem to wear out pretty much, and they &s;eem weary of it, &s;o that we may hope there are not &s;o many of our Seamen carried off that way as former|ly. The next Di&s;couragement, which however I mu&s;t place to the Account of the fir&s;t, is, that tho&s;e Sea|men who, tho' they may be poor and reduced, yet are hone&s;t, and willing to enter into the Service of their Country, and willing, at the &s;ame time, to &s;up|port and &s;ub&s;i&s;t their Families, are driven by their Po|verty to anticipate their Pay by borrowing Money be|fore-hand, either for furni&s;hing them&s;elves with Ne|ce&s;&s;aries at their &s;etting out, or for putting it into the Hands of their Wives for the Support and Sub&s;i&s;t|ence of the Family while they are abroad.</P>
<P>In doing this, they are not only expo&s;ed to the un|happy Nece&s;&s;ity of devouring their Pay before they earn it, or, as they ordinarily call it, eating the Calf in the Cow's Belly, which is very di&s;couraging in it&s;elf: But they are farther expos'd to the cruel Exactions and Extortions of tho&s;e who thus advance Money upon their Pay, who (that Security being &s;o many ways pre|carious) will not lend upon the ordinary Con&s;ideration of Legal Intere&s;t; and the poor Borrowers being di|&s;tre&s;t for Money, are oblig'd to &s;ubmit to the hard Conditions; by which Cruelty, or rather by which Nece&s;&s;ity, the poor Mens Pay, however &s;mall or in&s;uf|ficient
<PB N="27" REF="30">
of it&s;elf, is le&s;&s;en'd, and render'd yet &s;maller to a degree which really is very affecting, even but to relate: &s;o that if the Pay it&s;elf is at be&s;t but ill able to &s;up|port and &s;ub&s;i&s;t the Family of a poor Seaman; it is much le&s;s equal to it when thus reduced, perhaps one fourth, or one third, by U&s;ury and Extortion, and this exacted with the utmo&s;t Rigour; &s;o that the poor Sea|man, or his Family, when the Ship comes to be paid off, cannot receive one Farthing of his Pay 'till this Loan is fir&s;t wholly paid off and di&s;charged, the full Powers for receiving the &s;aid Pay being transferr'd from the poor Wife, or perhaps Widow of that Seaman, who&s;e Life perhaps is lo&s;t in the Service, or under the weight of the Di&s;couragement it&s;elf; for I verily believe, the Grief and Oppre&s;&s;ion of Mind which the poor Seamen (&s;uch of them as can think) feel from the con&s;tant Reflections on the Hard&s;hips they &s;uffer by &s;uch Things as the&s;e, kills as many as the Shot and the Swords of the Enemy.</P>
<P>But their Di&s;couragements do not end here; the Ex|actions as to Intere&s;t, as above, are great, but that is not all: The Abu&s;es put upon them by the Len|ders go farther; as fir&s;t, in taking Powers from them for larger Sums than their ju&s;t Debts, whether Prin|cipal or Intere&s;t, on pretence of Security for the Ac|cidents which attend the Loan of their Money; and &s;econdly, their taking Powers for the whole Pay ab|&s;olutely, leaving the poor Borrower to apply, not to the Publick, but to the unmerciful Creditor for the Over-plus; in which Ca&s;e many times the Lender proves In&s;olvent and Bankrupt more than the Borrower, and the poor Seaman lo&s;es it all; or if not, the Exactions for Trouble, pretended Charges in Attendance at the Office, Expence in receiving, and abundance of &s;uch like Pretences, are brought into the Account, 'till the poor Man's Pay is quite devour'd, or reduced to &s;o mi&s;erable a Pittance as makes him de&s;perate, and con|&s;equently mi&s;erable.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="31">Again: when all the&s;e Defalcations are allow'd and given up, yet the poor Man is left to wait, intreat, and perhaps, at la&s;t, to &s;ue for the Ballance; and &s;ome|times, if the Landlord keeps a Publick Hou&s;e, as of|ten is the ca&s;e, is drawn in to &s;pend the Ballance in Drunkenne&s;s and Exce&s;&s;es, and receives the la&s;t Pay|ment in extravagant Reckonings, long unju&s;t Scores, and &s;uch Methods as is u&s;ual among &s;uch People, to the utter Ruin of the Morals of the poor Seamen, as well as of their Families.</P>
<P>It may be true, that the poor Men them&s;elves, &s;ome for want of a ju&s;t Principle, and &s;ome made de&s;perate, and exa&s;perated by the&s;e Violences and Abu&s;es, do &s;ometimes act the unfair Part, and do enter into dou|ble Engagements upon their Pay; pledging it more than once for Money, affirming, tho' fal&s;ly, that it was not engag'd or pledg'd before; &s;o as it may be call'd Mort|gaging the &s;ame Effects to different Per&s;ons, grant|ing fal&s;e Powers, and making fraudulent Wills, and fraudulent A&s;&s;ignments of their Pay to particular Per|&s;ons, when the &s;ame Pay has been a&s;&s;ign'd and di&s;pos'd of to other Per&s;ons before.</P>
<P>This I &s;ay may be true, and I doubt does too often happen. Nor is this unfair Practice of &s;ome Seamen the lea&s;t of the Cau&s;es of the re&s;t being impos'd upon by the Lenders of Money, as above; who, con&s;idering the Hazards they run of the Seamens Integrity, as well as of their Lives (for if the Borrower dies, or runs from the Service the Debt is lo&s;t) in&s;i&s;t upon it, that they ought to have the greater Premium as a Con&s;ideration for the Ri&s;que, as well as for the Loan; and by this way of Rea&s;oning they pretend to &s;atisfie their Con|&s;ciences in their Exactions and Extortions upon, as well tho&s;e who are hone&s;t, as tho&s;e who are di&s;hone&s;t.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all this, the Complaint of the Di&s;couragement which the Seamen lie under in the Particulars above &s;tands good, and it is certainly well worth the Con&s;ideration of the Publick to re|dre&s;s
<PB N="29" REF="32">
them. The ill Conduct of &s;ome of them, is far from a ju&s;t Rea&s;on why Ju&s;tice &s;hould not be done to the re&s;t. And I make no doubt but were the general Di&s;|couragements of the whole Body removed, the Kna|very would be the le&s;s among the re&s;t, as we &s;hall &s;ee immediately.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, when the Parliament &s;hall be pleas'd to take the poor Seamen's Ca&s;e into their Con&s;ideration, and apply &s;uitable Remedies to the Di&s;couragements men|tion'd above, they will never want Ways and Means to prevent all tho&s;e Frauds of &s;uch Seamen as are di&s;|hone&s;t; which, as we &s;hall &s;ee in its Place, may be done without the lea&s;t Difficulty, and without Injury to the Borrower or the Lender. Nor can the Hou&s;e be at a lo&s;s to prevent the Oppre&s;&s;ions and Extortions of the Lenders, by which the poor and hone&s;t Part of the Seamen are &s;o abu&s;ed and di&s;couraged; of which I &s;hall al&s;o &s;peak in the Cour&s;e of this Work: for it is not de&s;ign'd to make this Work a meer Clamour of Grievances, without giving a due Pro&s;pect of the proper Means to redre&s;s them; that would be to write a kind of a Satyr upon the publick Management of the Navy, which is indeed no Part of the Bu&s;ine&s;s before me, or of my De&s;ign.</P>
<P>But I go on to the Detail of the Seamens Di&s;cou|ragements; another of them is the horrid Practice of forging and counterfeiting the Powers and A&s;&s;ignments of the Seamen for receiving their Wages, by which the poor Men are defrauded of the full Reward of their mo&s;t faithful Services; and when they have worn out a tedious Summer, and perhaps a Winter or two al&s;o, in all the Fateagues of Service, too ma|ny to reckon up, have born the exce&s;&s;ive Heat, the Storms, and Tempe&s;ts, the Di&s;ea&s;es and Di&s;tem|pers of contrary and unhealthy Climates, and the Hazards of Enemies, and come home in Expecta|tion of receiving their Wages, find them&s;elves robb'd, their Wages taken up and receiv'd by the
<PB N="30" REF="33">
help of Perjury and Forgery, and by tho&s;e wor&s;t &s;ort of Thieves, the Pretenders to Right, when they nei|ther had any Power to claim by, or real Debt to pre|tend to it from, and which is wor&s;e, know not who the Plunderer has been, or where to look for or en|quire after him.</P>
<P>Who can de&s;cribe, in Language moving like the thing it &s;elf, the Grief, the Agonies of the Soul of the poor injur'd Creature, and of his &s;tarving Family? who, after the Hard&s;hips they have &s;uffer'd, the poor Man abroad, and the poor Wife and Children at home, in a long &s;tarving Expectation of the Return of the Ship, run in Debt to all that would tru&s;t them on the Credit of the poor Man's Labour, and the certainty of his Pay, find them&s;elves after all thus cut off, at the very Hour of their greate&s;t Expectations; yet tho&s;e things we &s;ee often done in a manner too vile to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e Creatures have been detected, and, as often as they are, it will be acknowledg'd they have been &s;everely puni&s;h'd, as far as our Law directs. If the Law is defective, and the Puni&s;hment is neither equal to the Crime, or &s;ufficient to deter others from &s;uch Practice, that is the Misfortune of the Country, and in common with other Ca&s;es. It is but a little way from us, and even upon the &s;ame I&s;land, where it would be rewarded at the Gallows; which indeed I cannot but &s;ay, I think it richly de&s;erves. But neither is that our Bu&s;ine&s;s here.</P>
<P>This Practice al&s;o of counterfeiting Powers, and thereby receiving the poor Seamens Pay, is attended with another piece of Forgery, <HI>viz.</HI> forging of Wills, by which the poor Families of a decea&s;ed Seaman are defrauded of his Pay after his Death. This has been a Practice &s;o frequent, and has been &s;o much harder to detect than the other, that the wicked Contrivers of it have had but too much Encouragement, in carrying on the horrid Trade; &s;o that when a Ship or a Fleet comes into Harbour, they have no more to do but
<PB N="31" REF="34">
get a Sight of the Ship's Mu&s;ters, and &s;ee who are dead, getting their Names, and if po&s;&s;ible a Sight of their Hand-writing, or the knowledge whether they were able to write or no; and immediately they forge a la&s;t Will and Te&s;tnment for the deceas'd, make them&s;elves Executors, and then claiming a Debt from the Decea&s;ed, receive the Money as entitled to it, in &s;atisfaction of their pretended Debt.</P>
<P>I need not add that this likewi&s;e is among tho&s;e Grievances of Seamen, which are mo&s;t ea&s;y to be re|dre&s;&s;ed; the Parliament with the Breath of their Mouth are able to put an effectual Stop to all tho&s;e Practi|ces; a Clau&s;e of five Lines is &s;ufficient; that is to &s;ay, 'tis done with the greate&s;t ea&s;e imaginable; and 'tis in order to that Relief that I take the Freedom to mention it in this Place, and at a Time when the Sea|men have the happine&s;s of &s;eeing their Ca&s;e recom|mended to the Parliament from the Throne.</P>
<P>After what has been &s;aid thus briefly, and perhaps with rather too much Backwardne&s;s and Caution, le&s;t it &s;hould give Offence, and &s;o do the Seamen Harm rather than Good, and after what his Maje&s;ty has been plea&s;ed to &s;ay from the Throne, of the great Impor|tance of the thing in General, I flatter my &s;elf with the Belief, that none will &s;ay the Seamen do not want Encouragement, in order to bring them to en|ter <HI>freely and willingly, and without Force and Violence, into the Service of their Country.</HI> Nor can it be &s;aid, with ju&s;tice to the poor Men, that they are not at pre&s;ent under the&s;e Hard&s;hips and Di&s;couragements, their Numbers are greatly dimini&s;h'd, and the Diffi|culties of bringing them into Service are encreas'd; and, which is &s;till wor&s;e, many of them are by the&s;e things irretrievably di&s;per&s;ed and &s;cattered into the re|mote&s;t Parts of the World, and into the Service of al|mo&s;t all the Chri&s;tian Powers, and even &s;ome Heathen and Mahometan Powers, as well their Princes as their
<PB N="32" REF="35">
Merchants, from whence it is far from an ea&s;y Task to recover them, and bring them back.</P>
<P>It has been alledg'd, tho' I am loth to &s;ay much of it here, that many of our Seamen run from the Ser|vice in Circum&s;tances which render their Return hopele&s;s; for that, in &s;o many words, they dare not come home; and this not only as De&s;erters from the Service, for that an Act of Oblivion would take off; but as Debtors, having borrow'd Money on their Pay, or otherwi&s;e run into Debt at or before their entring in|to the Service, and not willing or not able to pay, cannot appear again in the Service, for fear of a Jail, the Service being no Protection again&s;t an Ar|re&s;t.</P>
<P>Some have &s;ugge&s;ted that the Seamen, having been thus ba&s;ely drawn in by the Money-lenders, mention'd above, to make over their whole Pay, for the Loan of but a little Money, and being vi&s;ibly oppre&s;&s;ed by the Avarice and Extortion of tho&s;e wicked People taking advantage of their Nece&s;&s;ity, and making them acknowledge more Debt than they owe, have in meer Revenge for that U&s;age run from the Service, for|feited their Pay, and in a manner bani&s;h'd them&s;elves for ever from their native Country, becau&s;e they ab|hor'd to be impo&s;ed upon in &s;o gro&s;s a manner. Thus puni&s;hing them&s;elves to the la&s;t Degree, on purpo&s;e to avoid paying &s;uch an unju&s;t Demand.</P>
<P>I will not take upon me to affirm this Part, tho' I doubt the Truth of it might too ea&s;ily be prov'd from the Acknowledgment of tho&s;e who have actually done &s;o. But this I venture to &s;ay, that tho' the Practice cannot be ju&s;tify'd in the Seamen them&s;elves, howe|ver provok'd by the ill U&s;age of tho&s;e Extortioners, yet it al&s;o &s;hows, that tho&s;e Abu&s;es of the Seamen are, together with the Inju&s;tice and Avarice of it, a very great Di&s;couragement to the poor Men, and by con|&s;equence an Injury to the publick Service; &s;eeing eve|ry thing that a&s;&s;i&s;ts to dimini&s;h the Number of Sea|men,
<PB N="33" REF="36">
bani&s;h them from the Service, and &s;catter them abroad in foreign and remote Countries, &s;o as that they are lo&s;t to their Country, is &s;o far a publick Grievance; and be&s;ides its being criminal in it &s;elf, as all &s;uch illegal Practices are, is criminal al&s;o in its Con&s;equences, as it is an Injury to the Publick, and indeed a Calamity to their Country.</P>
<P>It is true, the Seamen that act thus are not to be ju&s;tified by any means; on the contrary, they are Of|fenders in &s;everal Denominations, as acting unju&s;tly to their Creditors, whatever they can &s;ay of their Ex|tortion, as the Occa&s;ion or Pretence of it; for an In|jury receiv'd, does by no means ju&s;tifie an Injury done; nor does their extorting more than is their Due, di&s;|charge the Debtor in point of Con&s;cience from pay|ing what was really due. But the Right and Wrong of the Que&s;tion is not before us here: the pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s is, whether this is the Ca&s;e or no? and whether by this Extortion and Avarice on one hand, the Seamen being made de&s;perate, do fall upon tho&s;e unju&s;t de&s;perate Methods, to defraud the Lenders, on the other hand, or no? If the Affirmative is true, then they both concur to ob&s;truct the Service, and &s;o far both are Offenders; and 'tis worth while for the Le|gi&s;lature to enter into Mea&s;ures, to prevent the Pra|ctice; for all ju&s;t Governments chu&s;e rather to prevent Crimes, than puni&s;h them: The main End and In|tent of Laws is to deter Men from Offences, not to leave them at liberty to commit them, tho' at the Price of the Penalty; that would be to &s;uppo&s;e the Crime lawful to him, that is willing to run the Ri&s;que of the Puni&s;hment; a Principle fit for a Highwayman, or a Smuggler to act upon, not for Men of Con&s;cience and Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>There are many other Hard&s;hips and Di&s;cou|ragements which the poor Seamen often complain'd of formerly; &s;ome occa&s;ion'd by the Cheats and Frauds of their Officers; as in particular the Allowance
<PB N="34" REF="37">
of their Provi&s;ions, as to Quantity, and &s;ometimes in the Quality al&s;o; e&s;pecially in &s;uch Provi&s;ions as are added to the Ship's Stores abroad, where the laying in &s;uch Provi&s;ions is of cour&s;e left to the Prudence and Di&s;cretion of the Captain or Pur&s;ers, or the Agent of the Victualling abroad. But the&s;e things are pa&s;t, nor have been complain'd of for &s;ome Years.</P>
<P>It is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s, much le&s;s the De&s;ign of this Work, to arraign the King's Officers of Mi&s;manage|ment, or to make this Account a Charge upon any Body.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Abu&s;es of Officers are no part of our Ca&s;e; they are puni&s;hable, if the Fact be proved, by the Laws, as well as by their Superior Officers, and the Seamen have an open Door to make their Com|plaint, after they come Home. To recommend &s;uch things therefore to the Parliament, is to trouble the Hou&s;e with what they ought not to be troubled with, unle&s;s Redre&s;s could not be obtained in the Ordinary Way.</P>

<P>It remains, according to his Maje&s;ty's Gracious Re|commendation to his Parliament, to find a Remedy, if po&s;&s;ible, for the&s;e Evils, that the Seamen may be en|couraged, their Numbers encrea&s;ed, and they may be invited, not brought by Force and Violence to enter into the Service of their Country.</P>
<P>I am far from crowding the Heads of the Town with Projects: The unperforming Schemes of our Pro|jectors and Pretenders, tho&s;e Quacks and Mountebanks of the State, are my Aver&s;ion, as they have been the Mini&s;try's Burthen, in all our late Reigns; they have often perplexed this very Ca&s;e, but never, as I have yet &s;een, advanced one Step towards its effectual Cure and Redre&s;s.</P>
<P>But I remember a long and intricate Propo&s;al, once offered to the Publick, in the Reigns of King <HI>William,</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> which went &s;o far as to be thought worth con&s;idering of by his Royal Highne&s;s Prince <HI>George,</HI> then High-Admiral, and to be laid before a Committee of Parliament. I &s;hall give a Summary of the Scheme, becau&s;e it was new, and thought at fir&s;t to be practicable, but it is too long to repeat all the Particulars.</P>
<P>The Propo&s;al was, (1.) to form all the Seamen, or Sea|faring-men into a Body, and enter them all into the immediate Service and Pay of the Government. So that they were all at once the Government's hired Ser|vants, their Names and Abode always regi&s;tred, and Books kept di&s;tinctly in every Port, by the Cu&s;tomer or Collector of the Port; &s;o that there &s;hould be no Charge of new Offices and Officers, to eat out their Country's Trea&s;ure by unnece&s;&s;ary Salaries.</P>
<P>For the Encouragement and effectual Supply of Trade and Navigation, whether for the Merchant-Ships,
<PB N="36" REF="39">
Coa&s;ters, or Fi&s;hery, they &s;hould always be &s;upplied with Good and Able Seamen from the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, the Collector having no more to do than to &s;end a Summons to the Men to their Dwelling; knowing always by their Books who was abroad, and who was at home, with Orders what Ships to go on board of, and where; and One Port to borrow and lend to another, as Numbers were found over, or wanting.</P>
<P>For Encouragement of the Seamen to be always at hand, the Government was &s;uppo&s;ed to allow them Half-pay when out of Employ, and travelling Pay to return home when un&s;hip'd, or to go to the Port when &s;hipped where the Ship &s;hould lie.</P>
<P>That the current Pay of the Seamen from the Go|vernment being at that time 23 <HI>s. per</HI> Month when on board the King's Ships, the Merchants &s;hould pay to the Government 26 <HI>s. per</HI> Month for every able Sea|man, which was the ordinary Pay the Merchant gave at that time, and was not thought grievous, for it was rai&s;ed to 30 <HI>s. per</HI> Month, and higher, as the War made Men &s;carce. That by this Over-plus of Pay in the Merchants Service the Government would be able to pay all the Half-pay to the Seamen out of Employ|ment.</P>
<P>Al&s;o out of the &s;ame Fund Ho&s;pitals &s;hould be pro|vided, for taking Care of poor &s;ick Seamen, and a Che&s;t erected for Allowances to &s;uch as were maim'd, whe|ther their Maims were received in the Service of the Publick, or of the Merchant.</P>
<P>Al&s;o Ho&s;pitals to relieve at lea&s;t, if not to maintain the Widows and infant Children of &s;uch Seamen as died abroad in Service, as well in Merchant Ships as in the Royal Navy; others to be left to the Pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>All the Male-children of Seamen &s;o decea&s;ed to be bred up by the &s;aid Ho&s;pital to the age of 14 years, and then entred into Pay in Proportion to their Age, and to be &s;hipped as Occa&s;ion pre&s;ented.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="40">Commanders of Merchant Ships, and other Officers in proportion to their Commands, and to the Burthen of their Ships, to be obliged to take &s;uch Boys as their proper Servants, and to take care to in&s;truct them in the Art of Navigation, and to allow them Pay after the age of Fifteen Years, &s;uch as &s;hall be adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>The Re&s;t of this Propo&s;al is indeed too large to in|&s;ert it here: But the Propo&s;er &s;hews fully the Advan|tages to the Merchants, by removing all the Difficulties in getting Men, in abating the Expence of Victuals and Wages while in Port waiting 'till they are fully mann'd, and on many other Accounts.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the Advantages to the Government, that a cer|tain number of the&s;e Seamen, while out of Employ, and in Half-pay, &s;hould be always at hand, for doing the nece&s;&s;ary Works belonging to the Navy, clean&s;ing the Docks, Yards, Harbours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And for the Encrea&s;e of the Number of Seamen, the Government &s;hould entertain all &s;uch able-bodied Land|men as were de&s;irous to enter into the Marine-Service, who&s;e Half-pay &s;hould be proportioned to their u&s;ual Pay at Sea, and &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding their Half-pay, be at Liberty to work for them&s;elves, at any time when the publick Service did not call for them, either Abroad or at Home.</P>
<P>That every Merchant-Ship entertaining Ten Seamen and upwards, &s;hould be obliged to take one &s;uch able-bodied Landman at the Rate of 20 <HI>s. per</HI> Month, the Government to pay the &s;ame Men 18 <HI>s. per</HI> Month; by which means the able-bodied Landmen may be &s;up|po&s;ed in about two Years Service to be &s;ufficiently inur|ed to the Sea, and to be entertained as able Seamen.</P>
<P>This Propo&s;al in all its Parts, of which I have a Copy, tho' too long to in&s;ert it here, was &s;o far thought practicable, that it was as la&s;t declined only upon &s;ome Scruples about Liberty and Compul&s;ion, which &s;ome nice People, who have got over all the&s;e Difficulties in other Ca&s;es not le&s;s dangerous, pretend|ed to rai&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="41">Upon this Foot, I &s;ay, it was laid a&s;ide, (not re|jected) and had the Prince lived a little longer would, I believe, have been brought to be practicable. In which Ca&s;e there would always have been a &s;ufficient Number of Seamen on every Occa&s;ion, as well for private Service as Publick; for the growing Number of Landmen, upon the Encouragement of a Half-pay, with Liberty to work for their own Account while out of Service, would always have given you a Supply of Seamen for any Emergency, and yet their Number would not have been a Burthen to the Publick.</P>
<P>I have mentioned this, becau&s;e as I take the Encrea&s;|ing the Number of Able Seamen to be one of the greate&s;t Difficulties before us, as it &s;hocks our ad|ju&s;tment of Numbers, and makes that Number in Time of War, be as much too numerous for Trade in a Time of Peace, as the Number to be &s;pared in a Time of Peace is too &s;mall to Man out the Royal Navy in Time of War.</P>
<P>But by this Method the Number in general would be ek'd out, and greatly enlarg'd, and the Ways and Means taken by the Government to &s;upport the &s;u|pernumerary or extraordinary Men, will be doing that without a Burthen which would otherwi&s;e be an in|tolerable Weight upon them.</P>
<P>The Propo&s;al enters into &s;ome very ju&s;t Calculati|ons of the Number of Seamen in <HI>England,</HI> a Point &s;o very nice, that the mo&s;t critical in what they call Po|litical Arithmetick have been able to do nothing in it that we may depend upon. He judged that, includ|ing the Tran&s;port Service, and the extraordinary Num|ber of Ve&s;&s;els ju&s;t then employed in the Service, there were not le&s;s than 70000 Seamen at that time in the Go|vernment Pay, which notwith&s;tanding he &s;hews they could not rea&s;onably be thought &s;o, yet becau&s;e a given Number mu&s;t in all &s;uch Ca&s;es be the Ba&s;is of ju&s;t Calculations, he &s;uppo&s;es to be near one half of all the Seamen in <HI>England,</HI> that is to &s;ay, employed by the
<PB N="39" REF="42">
Navy and by the Commerce of <HI>England.</HI> So that he &s;tates the Number in General to be 150000 Seamen.</P>
<P>From this Number he inferrs, and for this Rea&s;on I mention it, That upon &s;uch a general Enrolling of Seamen there being one Man in Ten allow'd to be entertained, who he calls, according to the Language of the Navy, able-bodied Land-men, there would then be 15000 &s;uch Land-men always in Service, or on the Li&s;t: And the&s;e being &s;uppo&s;ed to be tran&s;|mitted from the Cla&s;s of Land-men to that of able Seamen in the Space of every Two Years; that very Article would &s;upply all the Incidents of Mortality by Di&s;a&s;ter among the able Seamen, allowing the nur|&s;ing up of Boys, the Children of Seamen, to go on in its ordinary Cour&s;e for a Succe&s;&s;ion to the general Fund of Seamen as it is already.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s this Scheme for the Encrea&s;e of Sea|men &s;eems the mo&s;t fitted for Practice of any I have yet met with, becau&s;e it provides a Fund for the Support of the &s;upernumerary Li&s;t, without bur|thening the Country, and lays a Foundation for the Supply of the Navy, upon any &s;udden Emergencies, in &s;o ea&s;y, certain and expeditious a manner, as would make the Naval Power of <HI>England</HI> very terrible in the World; for by this Method, whatever Exigence of &s;udden Service might pre&s;ent, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would be able to man out a formidable Fleet in a &s;horter Time than any other Nation in the World: For the Government would be &s;uppo&s;ed to have always 30000 Seamen at Home, or &s;o near Call, the coa&s;ting Naviga|tion included, that they might be all &s;hipp'd in four|teen Days time at farthe&s;t, and that without Hurry, without Violence, without Fail, and without Ex|pence.</P>
<P>I forbear to enlarge upon this Scheme, becau&s;e, as I have &s;aid, it may be called a Project, and is not I doubt likely to be attempted, and perhaps would re|quire &s;ome more than ordinary Application to be re|duc'd
<PB N="40" REF="43">
to Practice, e&s;pecially at fir&s;t; but I cannot quit it, without acknowledging, that if it might be &s;et on Foot, it &s;eems to me to be a Scheme the mo&s;t like|ly to an&s;wer all the Ends, as well of Encrea&s;ing, as of Encouraging the Seamen of <HI>England,</HI> and the mo&s;t capable of Improvement of any I ever met with.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t take a little Notice of the Schemes and Projects for this Work, which have been accepted by our Superiors, and have been reduc'd to Practice; &s;ome even of the&s;e we have found, cautiou&s;ly &s;peaking, Un|performing, or at lea&s;t In&s;ufficient, &s;uch as Ho&s;pitals for Sick and Wounded Seamen, which during the late War were found nece&s;&s;ary to be erected in &s;everal Places, I mean Temporary Ho&s;pitals on Shore, as well as Ho&s;pital Ships.</P>
<P>The&s;e were very u&s;eful indeed, and it was an En|couragement to the Seaman to &s;ee Provi&s;ion made for him in ca&s;e of Accident, whether by Wounds or other Di&s;ea&s;e; but I &s;ay, this is only Temporary, and the&s;e all cea&s;e with the War: Nor is this any thing at all to the Encrea&s;ing the Numbers of the Seamen, or Encouraging them in the Sen&s;e now propos'd, that is to &s;ay, to come in without Pre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The next and great Project, which made indeed a great Noi&s;e for a while, was that of Regi&s;tring the Seamen by Name in Books, and an Office for that Purpo&s;e to be kept at a great Expence, and for which the Seamen them&s;elves were to pay. But what has this done for them more than entitling them to an Ho&s;pital, which, with Submi&s;&s;ion, they were in|titled to Parochially before? which, tho' it was not an equal Provi&s;ion in the State and Magnificence of the Thing, or in the Plenty and Convenience of it, yet it may without Offence be &s;aid to be a &s;uperior Provi&s;ion for the Poor, as well Seamen as others, to any other of that Kind in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="44">It is true, and it has been often boa&s;ted abroad, that there are many more and greater Ho&s;pitals for Mainte|nance of the Poor in <HI>Spain, Italy, France,</HI> and <HI>Portu|gal,</HI> than there are in <HI>England</HI>; as the <HI>Mi&s;ericordia</HI> at <HI>Naples,</HI> which they tell us has 100000 Crowns a Year Revenue; another at <HI>Seville</HI>; and &s;everal others at <HI>Madrid,</HI> be&s;ides innumerable others; but this might be effectu|ally an&s;wered by telling them, that we have above 9000 Ho&s;pitals in <HI>England,</HI> be&s;ides all the Ho&s;pitals of private Endowment, every Pari&s;h being the poor Man's Ho&s;pital, in which he has a Legal Right by Inheri|tance to be maintained, and that therefore no poor Man in <HI>England</HI> can be &s;aid to &s;tarve, if the Pari&s;h-Of|ficers do their Duty.</P>
<P>But not to le&s;&s;en the Advantage to the Seamen of their Claim to a Retreat in the Royal Ho&s;pital of <HI>Greenwich,</HI> which the Regi&s;ter is &s;aid to entitle them to; nor to le&s;&s;en the Value of that glorious Founda|tion it&s;elf; yet it may be added, that &s;till in the main this &s;traitens the Circum&s;tances of the poor Seaman's Family, who&s;e Pay, tho' not large before, is yet made &s;o much le&s;s by the Allowances which he was obliged to make out of it towards this Ho&s;pital; be&s;ides all tho&s;e other Deductions made be|fore, &s;uch as to the Surgeon, to the Chaplain, to the Che&s;t at <HI>Chatham,</HI> &amp;c. all which may be &s;aid to a&s;&s;i&s;t in reducing the Pay of the Seamen; and this at a time when the Support and maintaining his Fami|ly is heavier upon him, than ever it was upon his Fore|fathers, the Seamen of the pa&s;t Ages.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty has indeed recommended the Ho&s;pital of <HI>Greenwich</HI> to the Con&s;ideration of his Parliament, and I will not doubt but Ways and Means may be found out to make that Foundation yet more exten&s;ive, and more capable of relieving the di&s;tre&s;s'd Seamen; I will, for once, &s;uppo&s;e it were, as I believe it might be made, an univer&s;al Support, &s;o that all the decay'd and invalid Seamen of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> were
<PB N="42" REF="45">
to have their A&s;&s;i&s;tance from it when they came to want it.</P>
<P>But I do not &s;ee much of the immediate Influence this will have on the pre&s;ent Encouragement of Sea|men, or on the Encrea&s;e of their Number; for,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Ho&s;pital does nothing, that I know of, for them 'till they come to be Old and Decayed, or Wounded and Di&s;abled, and 'tis a great Matter to do that; and were our Seamen a Generation of People that looked &s;o far be|fore them as from Youth and Strength, to Age and In|firmity, and from &s;ound and whole Limbs, to Wounds and Di&s;a&s;ters, things which they have as much Rea&s;on to think of as mo&s;t Men, it might be of &s;ome more Weight with them than I doubt it is. But it does not &s;eem to belong much to the Character of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seaman to think much, e&s;pecially of &s;uch remote things, and therefore we cannot &s;ay that Part is &s;o much of an Encouragement, as in the Nature and Rea|&s;on of the thing it ought to be.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Ho&s;pital is concerned principally in taking care of Seamen, <HI>out of</HI> the Service, not <HI>in it,</HI> and of Seamen pa&s;t Service, not encouraging them to the Service; it is the Seamen's Interval between the Sea and the Grave, where he is made comfortable to him|&s;elf, when he is good for nothing to any body el&s;e. Nor is this Undervaluing the Ho&s;pital in the lea&s;t, it is a very great Article in it&s;elf, and well worth the Cha|rity of a Chri&s;tian Nation to take care of the latter Days of tho&s;e poor Men who have &s;pent their Strength and Prime in the mo&s;t u&s;eful Service of their Coun|try.</P>
<P>But tho' the Ho&s;pital of <HI>Greenwich</HI> were in its utmo&s;t de&s;igned Perfection, it does not &s;eem to reach the pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e, or indeed to be much concern'd in it; 'tis the bringing Men into the Service, not the &s;ending them out of it, that is the pre&s;ent Enquiry.</P>
<P>The Introduction of Seamen is chiefly by breeding them up from Childhood on board the Ships, bringing
<PB N="43" REF="46">
them up to the Sea as an Employment or Trade; and 'tis chiefly done by our Colliers, Coa&s;ters, Fi&s;hing-Boats, Wherries, Keels, Lighters, and all the &s;mall Craft of Home-Navigation; the Merchant Ships in|deed carry &s;ome &s;uch, as Cabbin-Boys, chiefly by the Captain, and &s;ome Officers are allowed to take Boys, but the&s;e are few.</P>
<P>As the Seamen (at lea&s;t three-fourths of them) are thus bred to the Bu&s;ine&s;s from their mo&s;t early time, it can hard|ly be &s;ugge&s;ted that the Benefit of an Ho&s;pital for their late&s;t time is any Part of their Con&s;ideration, or is of weight in their Choice of the Employment; &s;o that this can have no great Share in a Propo&s;al for Encrea|&s;ing the Numbers of Seamen; that mu&s;t be a Work of a different Nature, and would well employ the Care of a Parliament, and indeed of any one el&s;e that can a&s;&s;i&s;t the Publick in an Affair of &s;uch Con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>To bring it into as narrow a Compa&s;s as I can, I &s;ee but two Ways by which the Numbers of Seamen can be <HI>encreas'd,</HI> I mean &s;uch as the Publick can concern it&s;elf in; for as for the Pari&s;h-Children, and the Chil|dren of di&s;tre&s;s'd Families, on or near the Sea-Coa&s;t, it is the natural Con&s;equence of their Situation, they flow as naturally into the Sea-Service, whether for War or Trade, as the Rivers run into the Ocean; but to do &s;omething in a publick Way, is to bring &s;uch Men or &s;uch Boys into and up for the Service of the Sea, which could not, or would not be done before.</P>
<P>For the Parliament to direct &s;ending &s;uch to Sea, as would of cour&s;e go there without that Direction, is doing nothing, or nothing to the Purpo&s;e, which is all one, and is below the Dignity as well as the Wi&s;dom of Parliament to be concerned in; but the Encrea&s;e which may be thought to come with &s;uch an Autho|rity as that of the Parliament, may be &s;uppos'd to be &s;ome of the&s;e, or &s;uch like:</P>
<P N="1">1. Some Mea&s;ures to be taken to bring up for this
<PB N="44" REF="47">
Service all that unhappy Swarm of young vagrant Boys, who at pre&s;ent are the Burthen, not of this City only, but of all the Towns in <HI>England,</HI> and who &s;eem to be brought up for the Devil, that is for the Gallows; for they generally learn to be fir&s;t Beggars, then Thieves, and if they are early tran&s;ported, 'tis a Mercy in their Fate which they have great Rea&s;on to be thankful for.</P>
<P>No Law, that I can think of, could be e&s;tabli&s;h'd up|on a more true Chri&s;tian Foundation; 'tis the height of Charity, and the mo&s;t &s;hining Virtue of a private Man, and the mo&s;t glorious of a Nation, for it &s;natch|es a Breed of Imps (as they may many of them be call'd) out of the Clutches of the Devil, out of the very Jaws of eternal De&s;truction, who&s;e Fate is &s;um|med up in few Words, thus, That they are born Beg|gars, bred Thieves, and dye Criminals.</P>
<P>Nor would the Number of them be incon&s;iderable; 'tis &s;carce credible what a black Throng they are; many of them indeed peri&s;h young, and dye mi&s;erable, before they may be &s;aid to look into Life; &s;ome are &s;tarv'd with Hunger, &s;ome with Cold, many are found frozen in the Streets and Fields, &s;ome drowned before they are old enough to be hang'd.</P>
<P>How noble a Foundation would an Ho&s;pital be, e|qual in Magnitude to that of <HI>Greenwich</HI> or <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> to receive the whole Body of the&s;e <HI>Mi&s;erables,</HI> to Feed, Cloath, Govern, and Teach them, from the Age of about Five to Fourteen, and then &s;end them out civi|lized, in&s;tructed, bred up to good Letters and good Manners, into the King's Service, or into the Mer|chants Service, as occa&s;ion &s;hould pre&s;ent. I &s;ay no more here; the Parliament, or the Government, if they e&s;pou&s;e &s;uch a Propo&s;al, know well enough how to improve upon it, and a &s;mall Payment to be made where I humbly think it would be no Burthen to the King, or to the Commerce, would rai&s;e a &s;ufficient Fund to endow and &s;upport it.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="48">Such a Step as this would rai&s;e a Succe&s;&s;ion of able Seamen, and in a few Years would come to remit a thou|&s;and, or perhaps two or three thou&s;and &s;turdy Youths every Year into the general Cla&s;s of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen; and it were ea&s;y to entail that Supply upon the Navy, by way of Preference to all other Service, by entailing &s;ome little Payment upon them from the Hou&s;e, as of|ten as the Navy giving a public Call, they &s;hall come chearfully in, and enter them&s;elves for the Service of their Country. I could enlarge very agreeably upon &s;uch a Propo&s;al as this, and upon the many Ways which it may be improv'd, and made u&s;eful to the Public, but I have not Room for it here.</P>
<P>As this Scheme would help to &s;upply the Navy with bred Seamen or Mariners, brought up to the Sea from their Childhood, &s;o another would bring a Supply of able-bodyed Landmen into the Service, equivalent to what is contain'd in the Scheme mention'd above, by which poor Men wanting Employment might be entertain'd in the Service of their Country, and brought in by Time and Experience to &s;erve as able Seamen.</P>
<P>The only Difficulty in either of the&s;e Propo&s;als, is, how the Government &s;hall find Bu&s;ine&s;s for any con|&s;iderable Number of Men in time of Peace; and if that time of Peace &s;hould la&s;t long, as &s;ometimes has been the Ca&s;e, what U&s;e &s;hall be made of them?</P>
<P>To this might be an&s;wer'd very directly, the Go|vernement are oblig'd to keep a very con&s;iderable Number of Men always at work in Naval Affairs, tho' it were a Time of continued, &s;ettled, and la|&s;ting Peace, and may keep more than they do now; and were I intending to make this Tract a Book of Schemes, I could lay &s;uch Ways open to the publick View, as would convince every Reader, there is no Difficulty in it, nor any Charge but what the things them&s;elves &s;hould &s;upply. But as I have &s;aid above that I am no Projector, &s;o I &s;hall not pretend to lead
<PB N="46" REF="49">
my Superiours in matters wherein they are &s;o abun|dantly &s;ufficient to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This is certain, that 4000 to 5000 able-bodyed Land-Men might with ea&s;e be employ'd in the Home Affair of the Navy, &s;uch as in Docks, Yards, Guard&s;hips, Rope|walks, repairing, building; and on every Occa&s;ion of Service, be transferred to the Navy with advantage. It would perhaps be thought Impertinent for an Au|thor without doors, to tell the Gentlemen in His Ma|je&s;ty's Service, how, and in what manner unexperienc'd and raw Men, &s;uch as by the U&s;age of the Navy are call'd <HI>Landmen,</HI> are to be fitted for the Sea Service, by tho&s;e &s;everal Employments about the King's Yards and Docks, which yet do not immediately denominate them to be Seamen: It is enough to &s;ay that tho&s;e Employments do &s;o much qualify them, as to make them handy at the Work, knowing in the Terms, and ready at many Particulars of the Sea Service, and they are with much the le&s;s Difficulty enur'd to the Sea, and made capable of every part of the Duty of a Seaman; and if other Men are two Years in ripen|ing up, or fini&s;hing for the Degree of an <HI>able Seaman,</HI> &s;uch Men will in one Year be equal to them.</P>
<P>Thus the King's Service will be its own Nur&s;ery, and the Navy be in a manner &s;ufficient to it&s;elf, or at lea&s;t as far as &s;uch yearly Encrea&s;e would contribute to it.</P>
<P>I could here al&s;o propo&s;e Mea&s;ures for the Encrea&s;e of Seamen, by the Method mention'd above, of obliging the Merchant-Ships to take always a certain Number of &s;uch able-bodyed Landmen on Board every Voyage they went, paying as is u&s;ual for raw unexperienc'd Seamen, the Publick paying an additional Sum to eke out their Pay. But tho&s;e Schemes are too tedious for this Work. I mu&s;t go on.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the &s;everal Ways and Means for encouraging Seamen to enter into the Public Service.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS I have given &s;ome Specificks for the Encrea&s;ing of Seamen, being the Fir&s;t Head mention'd in His Maje&s;ty's Speech, it remains to &s;peak of their En|couragement, which, tho' mention'd la&s;t, is indeed the mo&s;t important, and mo&s;t exten&s;ive Part of the Grie|vance, tho' it may perhaps admit of the plaine&s;t and ea&s;ye&s;t Remedies.</P>
<P>It is in a few Words expre&s;s'd thus; The contrary to tho&s;e things which have been enumerated as di&s;|couraging to the Seamen, and in which they are &s;aid to be under Hard&s;hips and Di&s;appointments, are the ju&s;t Mea&s;ures for their Encouragement: This is &s;peak|ing plain and to the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have &s;een a Propo&s;al in Print, and by an able Hand too, for an Addition to the Smallne&s;s of their Pay. If, <HI>as is &s;aid above,</HI> by Rea&s;on of the Difference between the Rate of things nece&s;&s;ary to the Support of a Family, the Seaman is under Hard&s;hip and Di&s;couragement, and is not able to live as the Seamen formerly could, then it may be properly &s;aid, his Pay is not &s;o &s;uffi|cient to him as it formerly was: For if it is not &s;o e|qual to his Expence, tho' it may not be le&s;s in Quan|tity, yet 'tis le&s;s in Effect; to give the Seamen what they cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon, tho' it be the &s;ame &s;pecific Pay which they had before, yet it is not the &s;ame in the Language of Wages, becau&s;e the poor Men cannot live as they did before, Provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary be|ing advanc'd in Price, their Money will not go &s;o far as it did before, neither in buying them Food or Fewel, Meat, Drink or Cloaths.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="51">It is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s to enter into a Calculation of the Proportions, in the difference of the Money, be|tween 23 <HI>s. per</HI> Month forty Years ago, and 23 <HI>s. per</HI> Month now; nor am I making a Demand for the Sea|men: I am rather &s;tating their Circum&s;tances, and lay|ing the poor Seamen at the Foot of the Parliament's Goodne&s;s, to con&s;ider their Condition, and to encou|rage them (as is the u&s;ual Terms of a Petition) in &s;uch manner as to the Honourable Hou&s;e, in their great Wi&s;|dom, &s;hall &s;eem meet: In &s;hort, I am only laying open the Fact, namely, that the Seamen are under &s;ome Di&s;advantages from the Proportion of their Pay, to the manife&s;t Difference in the way of Living, occa|&s;ion'd by the dearne&s;s of Provi&s;ions, Taxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as e|numerated above.</P>
<P>As far as their Di&s;couragements lie in this Particular of their Pay, &s;o far an addition of their Wages would be an Encouragement, that's certain; whether the Par|liament will think fit to encourage them by that Addi|tion, or by what other Method, is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But I cannot refrain earne&s;tly recommending to the Legi&s;lature, the &s;econd Head of Di&s;couragement, un|der which the Seamen &s;uffer the Abu&s;es and Injuries mention'd in our &s;econd Chapter, page 26. (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Exactions of U&s;ury and Extortion, lending Mo|ney to the poor Seamen upon their growing Wages, and taking exorbitant Intere&s;t on Pretence of the Ri&s;que they run of the Sailor's Hone&s;ty; be&s;ides taking A&s;|&s;ignments and Powers to receive their whole Pay, and leaving the Sailors to get the Overplus how they can, and &s;ometimes not at all.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Forging fal&s;e Powers, and taking up the poor Mens Pay without any legal Right; &s;o defraud|ing the poor Men of their Pay, after it being &s;o dear|ly earn'd at the Expence, or at lea&s;t the Hazard of their Lives.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e Evils call aloud to the Legi&s;lature for Redre&s;s, and both are mo&s;t ea&s;y to be redre&s;s'd; the
<PB N="49" REF="52">
fir&s;t, by e&s;tabli&s;hing an Office of Loan from the Go|vernment, by which the Seamen may be allow'd to borrow Money of the Government it&s;elf at a rea&s;ona|ble Intere&s;t, as the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company gave leave to the Owners of Stock to borrow Money upon it of the Company; which Loan upon their Pay, may be well &s;ecured, by only keeping a current Account for every Seaman, between their growing Pay and the Cre|dit given them: in which Ca&s;e the Seamen would be &s;av'd from U&s;ury and Extortion, and their Families be reliev'd, in&s;tead of ruin'd by the Loan. Whether it can be ju&s;t to prohibit the poor Men borrowing Mo|ney upon the Security of their Pay, without &s;ome &s;uch Medium as this for their Supply, I dare not determine without Doors, the Legi&s;lature will no doubt con&s;i|der that Part when it comes before them.</P>
<P>But if this Method is not taken, and yet the Sea|men left at Liberty (as Rea&s;on and Nece&s;&s;ity &s;eem to me to dictate, to borrow) then the Frauds of the Len|ders, and their Extortions on the poor Borrowers, may yet effectually be prevented by a Regi&s;ter of Powers; which if duly kept, as has been often pro|po&s;ed, no Counterfeit Powers could be made u&s;e of, nor any Per&s;on receive the Pay or Wages of a Seaman but tho&s;e who had a legal Claim to it, nor receive more of it than they had a Right to; &s;o the Seaman could not be abu&s;ed, or the Lenders defrauded of their Right.</P>
<P>This Regi&s;tring of Powers, like Regi&s;tring of Mort|gages, would al&s;o put an end at once to the Frauds of that &s;candalous &s;ort of People the Sollicitors, who go about to help People to their Wages, to get it receiv'd for them, and pretend to bring it to them; but much oftner conceal their having receiv'd it, and cheat the poor Men that labour'd for it.</P>
<P>While the&s;e Things are doing for the Safety of the Seaman's Property, and to &s;ecure him from the
<PB N="50" REF="53">
Cruelty and Extortion, the Frauds and Exactions of Lenders of Money and Sollicitors; there remains a|nother Clau&s;e on the Government's Side, which I &s;hall but mention, and recommend it to Authority, as a piece of Ju&s;tice to his Maje&s;ty's Service; namely, whether &s;ome Re&s;traint may not ju&s;tly be laid on the Commerce, that is, on the Merchants Service, that private Men, Ma&s;ters, Owners of Ships, Merchants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould not give more Pay to the Seamen than the King, or at lea&s;t be limited to a certain Rate.</P>
<P>It is certain Trade can have no Injury by this; for whatever Pay is given to the Seamen, in time of Scar|city of Men, tho' given by the Ma&s;ters and Owners, is all levied upon the Trade, and that with an Encrea&s;e, by advancing the Price of Fraight; This was evident in the late War, when Fraights of Ships were rais'd from 40 <HI>s. per</HI> Ton from <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> to 6 <HI>l:</HI> from 6 <HI>l. per</HI> Ton from our Colonies to 12 and 14 or 16 <HI>l. per</HI> Ton, and in others to a certain Rate on the Weight of the Goods, not the Bulk; all which was done on Pretence of the advance of Pay to the Seamen, who&s;e Wages were rai&s;ed from 24 <HI>s. per</HI> Month to 30 and 35 <HI>s.</HI> a-fore the Ma&s;t; and in proportion for Carpenters, Coopers, Cooks, and other Officers, to the great Ob&s;truction of the Publick Service, and no le&s;s to the Lo&s;s and Da|mage of the Commerce in General.</P>
<P>A due Re&s;traint upon this part would be no Hard|&s;hip upon the Seaman, but would make the Service of the Publick and of the Merchant more indifferent to him than it was before; nor wou'd it be any Damage to the Merchant, and would al&s;o be an Advantage to Trade in General. To conclude all, <HI>out of this Em|bryo</HI> may be brought forth a <HI>Sea-born Creature,</HI> which might out of its own Bowels effectually &s;upply the Publick all that it could be out of Pocket for the pro|pos'd advance of Wages to the Seamen, and yet Trade be &s;o far from &s;uffering, that the Merchants would ble&s;s
<PB N="51" REF="54">
the Propo&s;al, and think them&s;elves good Gainers by the Payment. But this is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s; it is enough that I have &s;tarted this Thought into the World, the Publick does not want more able Heads to work it in|to &s;hape, and make it, as it is abundantly capable of being, the be&s;t Scheme of its kind that has yet been laid before them.</P>
