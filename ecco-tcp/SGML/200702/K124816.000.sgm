<P>A Quaker is a <HI>Hogs-head of Phanatici&s;me</HI> drawn off to the Lees; a <HI>Common-Shore</HI> of Here&s;ie into which mo&s;t extravagant Opinions at la&s;t <HI>Disembogue</HI> them&s;elves and <HI>center,</HI> the <HI>fag-end</HI> of Reformation marked with a <HI>&s;ullen meagre-look,</HI> and this Characteri&s;tick <HI>Thou;</HI> A Fox in a <HI>Lamb|skin Coat,</HI> that retains his <HI>Subtlety</HI> though not his <HI>colour,</HI> a <HI>dough-baked</HI> piece of formality that decries <HI>Super&s;ti|tion,</HI> yet idolizes <HI>Garbs</HI> and <HI>Phra&s;es.</HI> You may know him by his <HI>diminitive-band,</HI> that looks like the <HI>Folorne|hope</HI> of his Shirt crawling out at his Collar; for his <HI>pu|rity</HI> con&s;i&s;ts only in his <HI>Dre&s;s,</HI> and his Religion is, <HI>Not to &s;peak like his Neighbours.</HI> His Orignal is as Ob&s;cure as the head of <HI>Nile;</HI> &s;ome refer it to <HI>Behmen</HI> the can|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Philo&s;opha&s;ter of <HI>Germany.</HI> Others run his Pe|digree higher, and &s;ay he was <HI>hatcht</HI> when the <HI>degra|ded Seraphm</HI> fir&s;t took on him to counterfeit an <HI>Angel of Light.</HI> He is a meer Compo&s;ition of <HI>Contradiction</HI> and <HI>Clowni&s;hne&s;sana,</HI> with a &s;ew odd <HI>Scruples</HI> of Hypo|cri&s;ie to give it a <HI>Tincture.</HI> Should the Parliament make a Law for Eating, he would Starve rather then be Guilty of obeying it; and if you would have him do a thing, you need only forbid it on Pain of Death: He thinks that to be <HI>Religious</HI> one is obliged to be <HI>Un|civil,</HI> and flings his Witts over Board to make room for <HI>In&s;pirations.</HI> His Dreams he Intitles Vi&s;ions, and each <HI>Crapicio</HI> of his Fancy mu&s;t pa&s;s for a divine <HI>Reve|lation,</HI> to which he Bla&s;phemou&s;ly puts a <HI>Probatum e&s;t, The Mouth of the Lord hath &s;poken it.</HI> The fir&s;t Article of

<P>For all his peaceable <HI>Sheepi&s;h</HI> Countenance, he de|lights in <HI>Contention,</HI> and when he is <HI>Thou-ing a Court</HI> of Ju&s;tice, thinks him&s;elf in his proper Element.

<P>In brief, a Quaker is a <HI>Cynick</HI> in Religion, one that would have <HI>Illnature</HI> tran&s;lated <HI>Grace;</HI> as if the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> (that <HI>pure &s;weet gentle Dove)</HI> did in&s;pire Men with <HI>&s;ullen Humours</HI> and <HI>wa&s;pi&s;h Di&s;po&s;ition:</HI> He hates both <HI>Magi&s;tracie</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;trie,</HI> and never &s;peaks, well of <HI>Authority</HI> or <HI>Obedience,</HI> but when he is going to la&s;h his <HI>Maid</HI> or his <HI>Apprentices;</HI> for though him&s;elf have &s;haken off all <HI>&s;ubjection</HI> to Superious, yet to his <HI>Dome|&s;ticks</HI> he is wor&s;e then an <HI>Egyptian Taskma&s;ter,</HI> and &s;peaks to his <HI>Servants</HI> in a tone as imperious as the <HI>Grand Seigniour</HI> to his <HI>Mutes;</HI> he cannot endure Cere|monies or Complements, e&s;pecially where his Belly is concerned, and therefore falls to all meat (as Gal|lants do to a Wench or Oy&s;ters) without &s;aying Grace, he is very diligent in his Generation-work, and may therefore have many Children but no Heirs; for his I&s;&s;ue comes into the World out-law'd, and can no more boa&s;t to be born in lawful Wedlock, then

the <HI>Kinchen-cove</HI> of a <HI>Gyp&s;ie</HI> got under a Hedge by a &s;trauling <HI>Tinker;</HI> he bannes the Banes, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> this Re&s;pect only refu&s;es <HI>Licen&s;e,</HI> Con&s;ummating his Marriage before it is Solemnized; for &s;o &s;oon as the Spirit begins to yield to the Rebellion of the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> and his Bowels Yearn to be Multiplying, he and his willing <HI>Doxy</HI> never wait the Par&s;ons Lei&s;ure, but take each others Word and &s;o to Bed.</P>
<P>The Devil that furni&s;hes others with his <HI>Tare</HI> but by Retail, deals with the Quaker by Whole &s;ale, &s;o many <HI>Here&s;ies</HI> Club to his Generation that 'tis Impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay which he Re&s;embles mo&s;t. Sure Satan had a Fancy to pre&s;ent the World with an <HI>Oglio,</HI> and therefore here hath Rendevouzed all his Hell bred Errours in <HI>Epitomie,</HI> and &s;et down a Catalogue of them in <HI>Short-hand.</HI></P>
<P>By his ob&s;tinate Zeal to keep his Noddle cover|ed, you may gue&s;s him a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> that re&s;ents nothing &s;o Di&s;honourable as a bare Head; and in|deed he hath no more Chri&s;tinaity in him than a <HI>Turk:</HI> His <HI>Good Fryday Looks</HI> &s;peak him a &s;uper&s;ti|tious <HI>Anchorite;</HI> his Subtlety and Equivocations would become a <HI>Je&s;uite;</HI> he Names his Children with as little Ceremony as other Folks do their <HI>Whelps;</HI> and &s;o far kees pace with the <HI>Anabapti&s;t,</HI> but of a &s;udden he out-&s;trips them, and falls in with the Seekers to deny all Ordinances.

<P>'Tis a prudent Maxime in the Art Military, never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o think too Contemptibly of an Enemy. Our Grandfathers &s;aw that <HI>Scotch-mi&s;t Presbytery</HI> ri&s;ing to bigger then a Mans Hand, and yet how Di&s;mal|ly did it in few Years over-&s;pread our whole <HI>Ho|ri&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;ider but this <HI>Quaking Gang</HI> in it's true Di|men&s;ions, and the Arts they have to promote their De&s;igns, and they will appear more formidable then mo&s;t of the other Eactions.</P>
<P>For Fir&s;t, They are a People generally Subtle, Frugal, Indu&s;trious, and Wary in their Dealing; by which and their large Preten&s;ions to a punctual Hone&s;ty, they have Ingro&s;&s;ed a grand part of the Nations Trade.</P>
<P>Secondly, Whereas other Per&s;wa&s;ions are di|vided into di&s;tinct Congregations, and &s;o have &s;e|veral particular TEACHERS, who frequent|ly Broaching different Whim&s;eys, Mince them into <HI>&s;ubdivi&s;ions,</HI> whil&s;t &s;ome dare not hear <HI>&s;uch an one,</HI> and others &s;cruple to Communicate with <HI>&s;uch a one,</HI> though all of a PARTY.</P>

The&s;e and &s;ome other <HI>Importants</HI> being due|ly weighed, render this <HI>&s;hivering Sect</HI> not &s;o in con&s;iderable as the common <HI>Rabble</HI> Deluded with their &s;pecious Pretences are apt to think them.

<LG>
<L>As white Powder di&s;charges without Noi&s;e,</L>
<L>So may Saint-&s;eeming Hypocrites De&s;troys,</L>
<L>Tru&s;t not too far, the &s;oft Hand &s;ometimes Smites</L>

<P>To conclude, a <HI>Quaker</HI> is a canting thing that Cozens the World by the Purity of his Cloaths, a few <HI>Clo&s;e-&s;tool Faces</HI> and whineing Expre&s;&s;ions, his Life is only a real Lye, his Doctrine contrary to all &s;ober Religon, and withal &s;o Trouble&s;ome that I am grown quite Weary of drawing his Character and cannot but wi&s;h him and all his Tribe fairly Embarqu'd for <HI>terra Incognita,</HI> of the late found <HI>I&s;le of Pines,</HI> under the Conduct of <HI>Penn</HI> their high <HI>Admiral.</HI></P>
