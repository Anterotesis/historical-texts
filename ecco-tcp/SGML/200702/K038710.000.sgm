<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour to receive your letter of the 17th of November la&s;t, in which, with &s;ome exceptions, you are plea&s;ed to con&s;ider favour|ably the letter I have written on the affairs of France. I &s;hall ever accept any mark of appro|bation, attended with in&s;truction, with more plea&s;ure than general and unqualified prai&s;es. The latter can &s;erve only to flatter our vanity; the former, whil&s;t it encourages us to proceed, may help to improve us in our progre&s;s.</P>
<P>Some of the errors you point out to me in my printed letter are really &s;uch. One only I find to be material. It is corrected in the edition which I take the liberty of &s;ending to you. As to the cavils which may be made on &s;ome part of my remarks, with regard to the <HI>gradations</HI> in your new con&s;titution, you ob&s;erve ju&s;tly,
<PB N="2" REF="5">
that they do not affect the &s;ub&s;tance of my ob|jections. Whether there be a round more or le&s;s in the ladder of repre&s;entation, by which your workmen a&s;cend from their parochial tyranny to their federal anarchy, when the whole &s;cale is fal&s;e, appears to me of little or no impor|tance.</P>
<P>I publi&s;hed my thoughts on that con&s;titution, that my countrymen might be enabled to e&s;ti|mate the wi&s;dom of the plans which were held out to their imitation. I conceived that the true character of tho&s;e plans would be be&s;t collected from the committee appointed to prepare them. I thought that the &s;cheme of their building would be better comprehended in the de&s;ign of the ar|chitects than in the execution of the ma&s;ons. It was not worth my reader's while to occupy him|&s;elf with the alterations by which bungling prac|tice corrects ab&s;urd theory. Such an inve&s;tiga|tion would be endle&s;s: becau&s;e every day's pa&s;t experience of impracticability has driven, and every day's future experience will drive, tho&s;e men to new devices as exceptionable as the old; and which are no otherwi&s;e worthy of ob&s;erva|tion than as they give a daily proof of the delu|&s;ion of their promi&s;es, and the fal&s;ehood of their profe&s;&s;ions. Had I followed all the&s;e changes,
<PB N="3" REF="6">
my letter would have been only a gazette of their wanderings; a journal of their march from error to error, through a dry dreary de&s;art, un|guided by the lights of heaven, or by the con|trivance which wi&s;dom has invented to &s;upply their place.</P>
<P>I am unalterably per&s;uaded, that the attempt to oppre&s;s, degrade, impoveri&s;h, confi&s;cate, and extingui&s;h the original gentlemen, and landed property of an whole nation, cannot be ju&s;ti|fied under any form it may a&s;&s;ume. I am &s;ati&s;|fied beyond a doubt, that the project of turn|ing a great empire into a ve&s;try, or into a col|lection of ve&s;tries, and of governing it in the &s;pirit of a parochial admini&s;tration, is &s;en&s;ele&s;s and ab&s;urd, in any mode, or with any qualifica|tions. I can never be convinced, that the &s;cheme of placing the highe&s;t powers of the &s;tate in churchwardens and con&s;tables, and other &s;uch officers, guided by the prudence of litigious attornies and Jew brokers, and &s;et in action by &s;hamele&s;s women of the lowe&s;t condition, by keepers of hotels, taverns, and brothels, by pert apprentices, by clerks, &s;hop-boys, hair-dre&s;&s;ers, fidlers, and dancers on the &s;tage, (who, in &s;uch a commonwealth as your's, will in future over|bear, as already they have overborne, the &s;ober in|capacity
<PB N="4" REF="7">
of dull unin&s;tructed men, of u&s;eful but la|borious occupations) can never be put into any &s;hape, that mu&s;t not be both di&s;graceful and de&s;tructive. The whole of this project, even if it were what it pretends to be, and was not in reality the dominion, through that di&s;graceful medium, of half a dozen, or perhaps fewer, in|triguing politicians, is &s;o mean, &s;o low-minded, &s;o &s;tupid a contrivance, in point of wi&s;dom, as well as &s;o perfectly dete&s;table for its wickedne&s;s, that I mu&s;t always con&s;ider the correctives which might make it in any degree practicable, to be &s;o many new objections to it.</P>
<P>In that wretched &s;tate of things, &s;ome are afraid that the authors of your mi&s;eries may be led to precipitate their further de&s;igns, by the hints they may receive from the very arguments u&s;ed to expo&s;e the ab&s;urdity of their &s;y&s;tem, to mark the incongruity of its parts, and its incon&s;i&s;tency with their own principles; and that your ma&s;ters may be led to render their &s;chemes more con&s;i&s;tent, by rendering them more mi&s;chievous. Excu&s;e the liberty which your indulgence authori&s;es me to take, when I ob&s;erve to you, that &s;uch apprehen&s;ions as the&s;e would prevent all exertion of our faculties in this great cau&s;e of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8">A ra&s;h recour&s;e to <HI>force</HI> is not to be ju&s;tified in a &s;tate of real weakne&s;s. Such attempts bring on di&s;grace; and, in their failure, di&s;counte|nance and di&s;courage more rational endeavours. But <HI>rea&s;on</HI> is to be hazarded, though it may be perverted by craft and &s;ophi&s;try; for rea&s;on can &s;uffer no lo&s;s nor &s;hame, nor can it impede any u&s;eful plan of future policy. In the unavoidable uncertainty, as to the effect, which attends on every mea&s;ure of human prudence, nothing &s;eems a &s;urer antidote to the poi&s;on of fraud than its detection. It is true the fraud may be &s;wal|lowed after this di&s;covery; and perhaps even &s;wallowed the more greedily for being a detected fraud. Men &s;ometimes make a point of honour not to be di&s;abu&s;ed; and they had rather fall into an hundred errors than confe&s;s one. But after all,&mdash;when neither our principles nor our di&s;|po&s;itions, nor, perhaps, our talents, enable us to encounter delu&s;ion with delu&s;ion, we mu&s;t u&s;e our be&s;t rea&s;on to tho&s;e that ought to be rea&s;on|able creatures, and to take our chance for the event. We cannot act on the&s;e anomalies in the minds of men. I do not conceive that the per&s;ons who have contrived the&s;e things can be made much the better or the wor&s;e for any thing which can be &s;aid to them. <HI>They</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="9">
are rea&s;on proof. Here and there, &s;ome men, who were at fir&s;t carried away by wild good intentions, may be led, when their fir&s;t fervors are abated, to join in a &s;ober &s;urvey of the &s;chemes into which they have been deluded. To tho&s;e only (and I am &s;orry to &s;ay they are not likely to make a large de&s;cription) we apply with any hope. I may &s;peak it upon an a&s;&s;urance almo&s;t approaching to ab&s;olute know|ledge, that nothing has been done that has not been contrived from the beginning, even before the &s;tates had a&s;&s;embled. <HI>Nulla nova mihi res inopinave &s;urgit.</HI> They are the &s;ame men and the &s;ame de&s;igns that they were from the fir&s;t, though varied in their appearance. It was the very &s;ame animal that at fir&s;t crawled about in the &s;hape of a caterpillar, that you now &s;ee ri&s;e into the air, and expand his wings to the &s;un.</P>
<P>Proceeding, therefore, as we are obliged to proceed, that is upon an hypothe&s;is that we addre&s;s rational men, can fal&s;e political principles be more effectually expo&s;ed, than by demon&s;trating that they lead to con&s;equences directly incon&s;i&s;tent with and &s;ubver&s;ive of the arrangements ground|ed upon them? If this kind of demon&s;tration is not permitted, the proce&s;s of rea&s;oning called
<PB N="7" REF="10">
<HI>deductio ad ab&s;urdum,</HI> which even the &s;everity of geometry does not reject, could not be employ|ed at all in legi&s;lative di&s;cu&s;&s;ions. One of our &s;tronge&s;t weapons again&s;t folly acting with autho|rity, would be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>You know, Sir, that even the virtuous efforts of you patriots to prevent the ruin of your coun|try have had this very turn given to them. It has been &s;aid here, and in France too, that the reigning u&s;urpers would not have carried their tyranny to &s;uch de&s;tructive lengths, if they had not been &s;timulated and provoked to it by the acrimony of your oppo&s;ition. There is a dilem|ma to which every oppo&s;ition to &s;ucce&s;sful ini|quity mu&s;t, in the nature of things, be liable. If you lie &s;till, you are con&s;idered as an accomplice in the mea&s;ures in which you &s;ilently acquie&s;ce. If you re&s;i&s;t, you are accu&s;ed of provoking ir|ritable power to new exce&s;&s;es. The conduct of a lo&s;ing party never appears right: at lea&s;t it never can po&s;&s;e&s;s the only infallible criterion of wi&s;dom to vulgar judgments&mdash;&s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The indulgence of a &s;ort of undefined hope, an ob&s;cure confidence, that &s;ome lurking re|mains of virtue, &s;ome degree of &s;hame, might exi&s;t in the brea&s;ts of the oppre&s;&s;ors of France, has been among the cau&s;es which have helped to
<PB N="8" REF="11">
bring on the common ruin of king and people. There is no &s;afety for hone&s;t men, but by believ|ing all po&s;&s;ible evil of evil men, and by acting with promptitude, deci&s;ion, and &s;teadine&s;s on that belief. I well remember, at every epocha of this wonderful hi&s;tory, in every &s;cene of this tragic bu&s;ine&s;s, that when your &s;ophi&s;tic u&s;ur|pers were laying down mi&s;chievous principles, and even applying them in direct re&s;olutions, it was the fa&s;hion to &s;ay, that they never intended to execute tho&s;e declarations in their rigour. This made men cautious in their oppo&s;ition, and remi&s;s in early precaution. By holding out this fallacious hope, the impo&s;tors deluded &s;ome|times one de&s;cription of men, and &s;ometimes another, &s;o that no means of re&s;i&s;tance were pro|vided again&s;t them, when they came to execute in cruelty what they had planned in fraud.</P>
<P>There are ca&s;es in which a man would be a&s;hamed not to have been impo&s;ed on. There is a confidence nece&s;&s;ary to human intercour&s;e, and without which men are often more injured by their own &s;u&s;picions than they could be by the perfidy of others. But when men, whom we <HI>know</HI> to be wicked, impo&s;e upon us, we are &s;omething wor&s;e than dupes. When we know them, their fair pretences become new motives
<PB N="9" REF="12" MS="y">
for di&s;tru&s;t. There is one ca&s;e, indeed, in which it would be madne&s;s not to give the fulle&s;t credit to the mo&s;t deceitful of men, that is, when they make declarations of ho&s;tility again&s;t us.</P>
<P>I find, that &s;ome per&s;ons entertain other hopes, which I confe&s;s appear more &s;pecious than tho&s;e by which at fir&s;t &s;o many were deluded and di&s;|armed. They flatter them&s;elves that the extreme mi&s;ery brought upon the people by their folly, will at la&s;t open the eyes of the multitude, if not of their leaders. Much the contrary, I fear. As to the leaders in this &s;y&s;tem of impo&s;ture,&mdash;you know, that cheats and deceivers never can repent. The fraudulent have no re&s;ource but in fraud. They have no other goods in their magazine. They have no virtue or wi&s;dom in their minds, to which, in a di&s;appointment concerning the pro|fitable effects of fraud and cunning, they can retreat. The wearing out of an old, &s;erves only to put them upon the invention of a new delu|&s;ion. Unluckily too, the credulity of dupes is as inexhau&s;tible as the invention of knaves. They never give people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but they always keep them in hope. Your &s;tate doctors do not &s;o much as pretend that any good what&s;oever has hitherto been derived from their operations, or that the public has pro&s;pered in any one in&s;tance, under their management. The nation is &s;ick,
<PB N="10" REF="13">
very &s;ick, by their medicines. But the <HI>charlatan</HI> tells them that what is pa&s;t cannot be helped;&mdash;they have taken the draught, and they mu&s;t wait its operation with patience;&mdash;that the fir&s;t effects indeed are unplea&s;ant, but that the very &s;ick|ne&s;s is a proof that the do&s;e is of no &s;lug|gi&s;h operation;&mdash;that &s;ickne&s;s is inevitable in all con&s;titutional revolutions;&mdash;that the body mu&s;t pa&s;s through pain to ea&s;e;&mdash;that the pre&s;criber is not an empirick who proceeds by vulgar expe|rience, but one who grounds his practice on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid in the la&s;t quacki&s;h addre&s;s of the National A&s;&s;embly to the people of France; that they have not formed their arrangements upon vulgar practice; but on a theory which cannot fail, or &s;omething to that effect.</NOTE> the &s;ure rules of art, which cannot po&s;&s;ibly fail. You have read Sir, the la&s;t Manife&s;to, or Moun|tebank's bill, of the National A&s;&s;embly. You &s;ee their pre&s;umption in their promi&s;es is not le&s;&s;ened by all their failures in the performance. Compare this la&s;t addre&s;s of the A&s;&s;embly, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate of your affairs with the early en|gagements of that body; engagements which, not content with declaring, they &s;olemnly de|po&s;ed upon oath, &s;wearing lu&s;tily that if they were &s;upported they would make their country glorious and happy; and then judge whether tho&s;e who can write &s;uch things, or tho&s;e who can bear
<PB N="11" REF="14">
to read them, are of <HI>them&s;elves</HI> to be brought to any rea&s;onable cour&s;e of thought or action.</P>
<P>As to the people at large, when once the&s;e mi&s;erable &s;heep have broken the fold, and have got them&s;elves loo&s;e, not from the re&s;traint, but from the protection of all the principles of na|tural authority, and legitimate &s;ubordination, they became the natural prey of impo&s;tors. When they have once ta&s;ted of the flattery of knaves, they can no longer endure rea&s;on, which appears to them only in the form of cen&s;ure and reproach. Great di&s;tre&s;s has never hitherto taught, and whil&s;t the world la&s;ts it never will teach, wi&s;e le&s;&s;ons to any part of mankind. Men are as much blinded by the extremes of mi&s;ery as by the extremes of pro&s;perity. De&s;perate &s;ituations produce de&s;perate councils, and de&s;perate mea|&s;ures. The people of France, almo&s;t generally, have been taught to look for other re&s;ources than tho&s;e which can be derived from order, frugality, and indu&s;try. They are generally armed; and they are made to expect much from the u&s;e of arms. <HI>Nihil non arrogant armis.</HI> Be&s;ides this, the retrograde order of &s;ociety has &s;omething flattering to the di&s;po&s;itions of man|kind. The life of adventurers, game&s;ters, gip|&s;ies, beggars, and robbers, is not unplea&s;ant. It requires re&s;traint to keep men from falling
<PB N="12" REF="15">
into that habit. The &s;hifting tides of fear and hope, the flight and pur&s;uit, the peril and e&s;cape, the alternate famine and fea&s;t, of the &s;avage and the thief, after a time, render all cour&s;e of &s;low, &s;teady, progre&s;&s;ive, unvaried occupation, and the pro&s;pect only of a limited mediocrity at the end of long labour, to the la&s;t degree tame, languid, and in&s;ipid. Tho&s;e who have been once in|toxicated with power, and have derived any kind of emolument from it, even though but for one year, never can willingly abandon it. They may be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in the mid&s;t of all their power; but they will never look to any thing but power for their relief. When did di&s;tre&s;s ever oblige a prince to abdicate his authority? And what effect will it have upon tho&s;e who are made to believe them&s;elves a people of princes?</P>
<P>The more active and &s;tirring part of the lower orders having got government, and the di&s;tribution of plunder, into their hands, they will u&s;e its re&s;ources in each municipality to form a body of adherents. The&s;e rulers, and their adherents, will be &s;trong enough to overpower the di&s;contents of tho&s;e who have not been able to a&s;&s;ert their &s;hare of the &s;poil. The unfor|tunate adventurers in the cheating lottery of plunder will probably be the lea&s;t &s;agacious, or the mo&s;t inactive and irre&s;olute of the gang.
<PB N="13" REF="16">
If, on di&s;appointment, they &s;hould dare to &s;tir, they will &s;oon be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed as rebels and muti|neers by their brother rebels. Scantily fed for a while, with the offal of plunder, they will drop off by degrees; they will be driven out of &s;ight, and out of thought; and they will be left to peri&s;h ob&s;curely, like rats, in holes and corners.</P>
<P>From the forced repentance of invalid muti|neers and di&s;banded thieves, you can hope for no re&s;ource. Government it&s;elf, which ought to con&s;train the more bold and dextrous of the&s;e robbers, is their accomplice. Its arms, its trea&s;ures, its all, are in their hands. Judi|cature, which above all things &s;hould awe them, is their creature and their in&s;trument. Nothing &s;eems to me to render your internal &s;ituation more de&s;perate than this one circum&s;tance of the &s;tate of your judicature. Many days are not pa&s;t &s;ince we have &s;een a &s;et of men brought forth by your rulers for a mo&s;t critical function. Your rulers brought forth a &s;et of men, &s;teaming from the &s;weat and drudgery, and all black with the &s;moak and foot of the forge of confi&s;cation and robbery&mdash;<HI>ardentis ma&s;&s;ae fuligine lippos,</HI> a &s;et of men brought forth from the trade of ham|mering arms of proof, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive,
<PB N="14" REF="17">
in aid of the enterprizes, and for the &s;ub&s;equent protection of hou&s;ebreakers, murderers, traitors, and malefactors; men, who had their minds &s;ea|&s;oned with theories perfectly conformable to their practice, and who had always laughed at po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion and pre&s;cription, and defied all the fundamental maxims of juri&s;prudence. To the horror and &s;tupefaction of all the hone&s;t part of this nation, and indeed of all nations who are &s;pectators, we have &s;een, on the credit of tho&s;e very practices and principles, and to carry them further into effect, the&s;e very men placed on the &s;acred &s;eat of ju&s;tice in the capital city of your late kingdom. We &s;ee, that in future, you are to be de&s;troyed with more form and re|gularity. This is not peace; it is only the in|troduction of a &s;ort of di&s;cipline in their ho&s;tility. Their tyranny is complete, in their ju&s;tice; and their lanthorn is not half &s;o dreadful as their court.</P>
<P>One would think that out of common de|cency they would have given you men who had not been in the habit of trampling upon law and ju&s;tice in the a&s;&s;embly, neutral men, or men apparently neutral, for judges, who are to di&s;po&s;e of your lives and fortunes.</P>
<P>Cromwell, when he attempted to legalize his power, and to &s;ettle his conquered country in a
<PB N="15" REF="18" MS="y">
&s;tate of order, did not look for his di&s;pen&s;ers of ju&s;tice in the in&s;truments of his u&s;urpation. Quite the contrary. He &s;ought out with great &s;ollicitude and &s;election, and even from the party mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to his de&s;igns, men of weight, and decorum of character; men un&s;tained with the violence of the times, and with hands not fouled with confi&s;cation and &s;acrilege: for he cho&s;e an <HI>Hales</HI> for his chief ju&s;tice, though he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to take his civic oaths, or to make any acknowledgment what&s;oever of the legality of his government. Cromwell told this great lawyer, that &s;ince he did not approve his title, all he required of him was, to admini&s;|ter, in a manner agreeable to his pure &s;entiments and un&s;potted character, that ju&s;tice without which human &s;ociety cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t: that it was not his particular government, but civil order it&s;elf, which as a judge he wi&s;hed him to &s;upport. Cromwell knew how to &s;eparate the in&s;titutions expedient to his u&s;urpation from the admini&s;tra|tion of the public ju&s;tice of his country. For Cromwell was a man in whom ambition had not wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, but only &s;u&s;pended the &s;enti|ments of religion, and the love (as far it could con&s;i&s;t with his de&s;igns) of fair and honourable reputation. Accordingly, we are indebted to this act of his for the pre&s;ervation of our laws,
<PB N="16" REF="19">
which &s;ome &s;en&s;ele&s;s a&s;&s;ertors of the rights of men were then on the point of entirely era&s;ing, as relicks of feudality and barbari&s;m. Be&s;ides, he gave in the appointment of that man, to that age, and to all po&s;terity, the mo&s;t brilliant ex|ample of &s;incere and fervent piety, exact ju&s;tice, and profound juri&s;prudence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Burnet's life of Hales.</NOTE>. But the&s;e are not the things in which your philo&s;ophic u&s;urpers choo&s;e to follow Cromwell.</P>
<P>One would think, that after an hone&s;t and ne|ce&s;&s;ary Revolution (if they had a mind that theirs &s;hould pa&s;s for &s;uch) your ma&s;ters would have imitated the virtuous policy of tho&s;e who have been at the head of revolutions of that glorious character. Burnet tells us, that no|thing tended to reconcile the Engli&s;h nation to the government of King William &s;o much as the care he took to fill the vacant bi&s;hoprics with men who had attracted the public e&s;teem by their learning, eloquence, and piety, and above all, by their known moderation in the &s;tate. With you, in your purifying Revolu|tion, whom have you cho&s;en to regulate the church? Mr. Mirabeau is a fine &s;peaker&mdash;and a fine writer,&mdash;and a fine&mdash;a very fine man;&mdash;but really nothing gave more &s;urprize to every
<PB N="17" REF="20" MS="y">
body here, than to find him the &s;upreme head of your eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. The re&s;t is of cour&s;e. Your A&s;&s;embly addre&s;&s;es a manife&s;to to France in which they tell the people, with an in&s;ulting irony, that they have brought the church to its primitive condition. In one re&s;pect their de|claration is undoubtedly true; for they have brought it to a &s;tate of poverty and per&s;ecution. What can be hoped for after this? Have not men (if they de&s;erve the name) under this new hope and head of the church, been made bi|&s;hops, for no other merit than having acted as in&s;truments of athei&s;ts; for no other merit than having thrown the children's bread to dogs; and in order to gorge the whole gang of u&s;urers; pedlars, and itinerant Jew-di&s;counters at the corners of &s;treets, &s;tarved the poor of their Chri&s;tian flocks, and their own brother pa&s;tors? Have not &s;uch men been made bi&s;hops to ad|mini&s;ter in temples, in which (if the patriotic donations have not already &s;tripped them of their ve&s;&s;els) the churchwardens ought to take &s;ecurity for the altar plate, and not &s;o much as to tru&s;t the chalice in their &s;acrilegious hands, &s;o long as Jews have a&s;&s;ignats on eccle&s;ia&s;tic plunder, to exchange for the &s;ilver &s;tolen from churches?</P>

<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, in concurrence with us, nobly interfered to &s;ave Holland from confu&s;ion.

If this is done in favour of a barbarous nation, with a barbarous neglect of police, fatal to the human race, in favour of a nation, by principle in eternal enmity with the Chri&s;tian name; a nation which will not &s;o much as give the &s;alutation of peace (Salam) to any of us; nor make any pact with any Chri&s;tian nation beyond a truce;&mdash;if this be done in favour of the Turk, &s;hall it be thought either impolitic, or unju&s;t, or un|charitable, to employ the &s;ame power, to re&s;cue from captivity a virtuous monarch (by the courte&s;y of Europe con&s;idered as Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian) who, after an intermi&s;&s;ion of 175 years, had called together the &s;tates of his kingdom, to re|form abu&s;es, to e&s;tabli&s;h a free government, and to &s;trengthen his throne; a monarch, who at the very out&s;et, without force, even without &s;ollicitation, had given to his people &s;uch a

Magna Charta of privileges, as never was given by any king to any &s;ubjects?&mdash;Is it to be tamely borne by kings who love their &s;ubjects, or by &s;ubjects who love their kings, that this monarch, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e gracious acts, was in&s;o|lently and cruelly torn from his palace, by a gang of traitors and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and kept in clo&s;e pri&s;on to this very hour, whil&s;t his royal name and &s;acred character were u&s;ed for the total ruin of tho&s;e whom the laws had appointed him to protect?</P>
<P>The only offence of this unhappy monarch towards his people, was his attempt, under a monarchy, to give them a free con&s;titution. For this, by an example hitherto unheard of in the world, he has been depo&s;ed. It might well di&s;grace &s;overeigns to take part with a depo&s;ed tyrant. It would &s;uppo&s;e in them a vitious &s;ym|pathy. But not to make a common cau&s;e with a ju&s;t prince, dethroned by traitors and rebels, who pro&s;cribe, plunder, confi&s;cate, and in every way cruelly oppre&s;s their fellow citizens, in my opinion is to forget what is due to the honour, and to the rights of all virtuous and legal government.</P>
<P>I think the king of France to be as much an object both of policy and compa&s;&s;ion as the
<PB N="24" REF="27">
Grand Seignor or his &s;tates. I do not conceive, that the total annihilation of France (if that could be effected) is a de&s;irable thing to Europe; or even to this its rival nation. Provident patriots did not think it good for Rome, that even Carthage &s;hould be quite de&s;troyed; and he was a wi&s;e Greek, wi&s;e for the general Grecian intere&s;ts, as well as a brave Lacedemo|nian enemy, and generous conqueror, who did not wi&s;h, by the de&s;truction of Athens, to pluck out the other eye of Greece.</P>
<P>However, Sir, what I have here &s;aid of the interference of foreign princes is only the opinion of a private individual; who is neither the re|pre&s;entative of any &s;tate, nor the organ of any party; but who thinks him&s;elf bound to expre&s;s his own &s;entiments with freedom and energy in a cri&s;is of &s;uch importance to the whole human race.</P>
<P>I am not apprehen&s;ive that in &s;peaking freely on the &s;ubject of the King and Queen of France, I &s;hall accelerate (as you fear) the execution of traiterous de&s;igns again&s;t them. You are of opinion, Sir, that the u&s;urpers may, and that they will, gladly lay hold of any pretext to throw off the very name of a king;&mdash;a&s;&s;uredly I do not wi&s;h ill to your king; but better for him not to

live (he does not reign) than to live the pa&s;&s;ive in&s;trument of tyranny and u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>I certainly meant to &s;hew, to the be&s;t of my power, that the exi&s;tence of &s;uch an exe|cutive officer, in &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of republic as theirs, is ab&s;urd in the highe&s;t degree. But in demon&s;trating this&mdash;to <HI>them,</HI> at lea&s;t, I can have made no di&s;covery. They only held out the royal name to catch tho&s;e Frenchmen to whom the name of king is &s;till venerable. They calcu|late the duration of that &s;entiment; and when they find it nearly expiring, they will not trouble them&s;elves with excu&s;es for extingui&s;hing the name, as they have the thing. They u&s;ed it as a &s;ort of navel-&s;tring to nouri&s;h their unnatural offspring from the bowels of royalty it&s;elf. Now that the mon&s;ter can purvey for its own &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, it will only carry the mark about it, as a token of its having torn the womb it came from. Tyrants &s;eldom want pretexts. Fraud is the ready mini&s;ter of inju&s;tice; and whil&s;t the currency of fal&s;e pretence and &s;ophi&s;tic rea&s;oning was expedient to their de&s;igns, they were under no nece&s;&s;ity of drawing upon me to furni&s;h them with that coin. But pretexts and &s;ophi&s;ms have had their day; and have done their work. The
<PB N="26" REF="29" MS="y">
u&s;urpation no longer &s;eeks plau&s;ibility. It tru&s;ts to power.</P>
<P>Nothing that I can &s;ay, or that you can &s;ay, will ha&s;ten them by a &s;ingle hour, in the execu|tion of a de&s;ign which they have long &s;ince en|tertained. In &s;pite of their &s;olemn declarations, their &s;oothing addre&s;&s;es, and the multiplied oaths which they have taken, and forced others to take, they will a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king when his name will no longer be nece&s;&s;ary to their de&s;igns; but not a moment &s;ooner. They will probably fir&s;t a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the queen, whenever the renewed menace of &s;uch an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination lo&s;es its effect upon the anxious mind of an affectionate hu&s;band. At pre&s;ent, the advantage which they derive from the daily threats again&s;t her life, is her only &s;ecurity for pre&s;erving it. They keep their &s;o|vereign alive for the purpo&s;e of exhibiting him, like &s;ome wild bea&s;t at a fair; as if they had a Bajazet in a cage. They choo&s;e to make monar|chy contemptible by expo&s;ing it to deri&s;ion, in the per&s;on of the mo&s;t benevolent of their kings.</P>
<P>In my opinion, their in&s;olence appears more odious even than their crimes. The horrors of the 5th and 6th of October were le&s;s dete&s;table than the fe&s;tival of the 14th of July. There are
<PB N="27" REF="30">
&s;ituations (God forbid I &s;hould think that of the 5th and 6th of October one of them) in which the be&s;t men may be confounded with the wor&s;t, and in the darkne&s;s and confu&s;ion, in the pre&s;s and medley of &s;uch extremities, it may not be &s;o ea&s;y to di&s;criminate the one from the other. The nece&s;&s;ities created, even by ill de&s;igns, have their excu&s;e. They may be forgotten by others, when the guilty them&s;elves do not choo&s;e to cheri&s;h their recollection, and by ruminating their offences, nouri&s;h them&s;elves through the example of their pa&s;t, to the perpetration of future crimes. It is in the relaxation of &s;ecurity, it is in the expan&s;ion of pro&s;perity, it is in the hour of dilatation of the heart, and of its &s;often|ing into fe&s;tivity and plea&s;ure, that the real character of men is di&s;cerned. If there is any good in them, it appears then or never. Even wolves and tygers, when gorged with their prey, are &s;afe and gentle. It is at &s;uch times that noble minds give all the reins to their good-na|ture. They indulge their genius even to intem|perance, in kindne&s;s to the afflicted, in genero&s;ity to the conquered; forbearing in&s;ults, forgiving injuries, overpaying benefits. Full of dignity them&s;elves, they re&s;pect dignity in all, but they feel it &s;acred in the unhappy. But it is then, and
<PB N="28" REF="31">
ba&s;king in the &s;un&s;hine of unmerited fortune, that low, &s;ordid, ungenerous, and reptile &s;ouls &s;well with their hoarded poi&s;ons; it is then that they di&s;play their odious &s;plendor, and &s;hine out in the full lu&s;tre of their native villainy and ba&s;e|ne&s;s. It is in that &s;ea&s;on that no man of &s;en&s;e or honour can be mi&s;taken for one of them. It was in &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, for them of political ea&s;e and &s;ecurity, tho' their people were but ju&s;t emerged from actual famine, and were ready to be plunged into a gulph of penury and beggary, that your philo&s;ophic lords cho&s;e, with an o&s;tentatious pomp and luxury, to fea&s;t an in|credible number of idle and thoughtle&s;s people collected with art and pains, from all quarters of the world.

On this pillory they &s;et their lawful king and queen, with an in&s;ulting figure over their heads. There they expo&s;ed the&s;e objects of pity and re|&s;pect to all good minds, to the deri&s;ion of an unthinking and unprincipled multitude, dege|nerated even from the ver&s;atile tenderne&s;s which marks the irregular and capricious feelings of the populace. That their cruel in&s;ult might have

nothing wanting to complete it, they cho&s;e the anniver&s;ary of that day in which they expo&s;ed the life of their prince to the mo&s;t imminent dangers, and the vile&s;t indignities, ju&s;t following the in&s;tant when the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, whom they had hired without owning, fir&s;t openly took up arms again&s;t their king, corrupted his guards, &s;urprized his ca&s;tle, butchered &s;ome of the poor invalids of his garri&s;on, murdered his governor, and, like wild bea&s;ts, tore to pieces the chief magi&s;trate of his capital city, on account of his fidelity to his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Till the ju&s;tice of the world is awakened, &s;uch as the&s;e will go on, without admonition, and without provocation, to every extremity. Tho&s;e who have made the exhibition of the 14th of July, are capable of every evil. They do not commit crimes for their de&s;igns; but they form de&s;igns that they may commit crimes. It is not their nece&s;&s;ity, but their nature, that impels them. They are modern philo&s;ophers, which when you &s;ay of them, you expre&s;s every thing that is ig|noble, &s;avage, and hard-hearted.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;ure tokens which are given by the &s;pirit of their particular arrangements, there are &s;ome characteri&s;tic lineaments in the general policy of your tumultuous de&s;po|ti&s;m,
<PB N="30" REF="33">
which, in my opinion, indicate beyond a doubt that no revolution what&s;oever <HI>in their di&s;|po&s;ition</HI> is to be expected. I mean their &s;cheme of educating the ri&s;ing generation, the principles which they intend to in&s;til, and the &s;ympathies which they wi&s;h to form in the mind, at the &s;ea&s;on in which it is the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible. In|&s;tead of forming their young minds to that do|cility, to that mode&s;ty, which are the grace and charm of youth, to an admiration of famous ex|amples, and to an aver&s;ene&s;s to any thing which approaches to pride, petulance, and &s;elf-conceit, (di&s;tempers to which that time of life is of it|&s;elf &s;ufficiently liable) they artificially foment the&s;e evil di&s;po&s;itions, and even form them into &s;prings of action. Nothing ought to be more weighed than the nature of books recommended by public authority. So recommended, they &s;oon form the character of the age. Uncertain indeed is the efficacy, limited indeed is the ex|tent of a virtuous in&s;titution. But if education takes in <HI>vice</HI> as any part of its &s;y&s;tem, there is no doubt but that it will operate with abundant energy, and to an extent indefinite. The ma|gi&s;trate, who in favour of freedom thinks him|&s;elf obliged to &s;uffer all &s;orts of publications, is under a &s;tricter duty than any other, well to
<PB N="31" REF="34" MS="y">
con&s;ider what &s;ort of writers he &s;hall authorize; and &s;hall recommend, by the &s;tronge&s;t of all &s;anctions, that is, by public honours and rewards.

He ought to be fearful of putting into the hands of youth writers indulgent to the peculiarities of their own complexion, le&s;t they &s;hould teach the humours of the profe&s;&s;or, rather than the prin|ciples of the &s;cience. He ought, above all, to be cautious in recommending any writer who has carried marks of a deranged under&s;tanding; for where there is no &s;ound rea&s;on, there can be no real virtue; and madne&s;s is ever vitious and malignant.</P>
<P>The National A&s;&s;embly proceeds on maxims the very rever&s;e of the&s;e. The A&s;&s;embly re|commends to its youth a &s;tudy of the bold expe|rimenters in morality. Every body knows that there is a great di&s;pute among&s;t their leaders, which of them is the be&s;t re&s;emblance to Rou&s;|&s;eau. In truth, they all re&s;emble him. His blood they transfu&s;e into their minds and into their man|ners. Him they &s;tudy; him they meditate; him they turn over in all the time they can &s;pare from the laborious mi&s;chief of the day, or the de|bauches of the night. Rou&s;&s;eau their canon of

holy writ; in his life he is their canon of <HI>Polycle|tus</HI>; he is their &s;tandard figure of perfection. To this man and this writer, as a pattern to authors and to Frenchmen, the founderies of Paris are now running for &s;tatues, with the kettles of their poor and the bells of their churches. If an author had written like a great genius on geometry, though his practical and &s;peculative morals were vitious in the extreme, it might ap|pear that in voting the &s;tatue, they honoured only the geometrician. But Rou&s;&s;eau is a mo|rali&s;t, or he is nothing. It is impo&s;&s;ible, there|fore, putting the circum&s;tances together, to mi&s;|take their de&s;ign in choo&s;ing the author, with whom they have begun to recommend a cour&s;e of &s;tudies.</P>
<P>Their great problem is to find a &s;ub&s;titute for all the principles which hitherto have been employed to regulate the human will and action. They find di&s;po&s;itions in the mind, of &s;uch force and quality, as may fit men, far better than the old morality, for the purpo&s;es of &s;uch a &s;tate as theirs, and may go much further in &s;upport|ing their power, and de&s;troying their enemies. They have therefore cho&s;en a &s;elfi&s;h, flattering, &s;eductive, o&s;tentatious vice, in the place of plain duty. True humility, the ba&s;is of the Chri&s;tian
<PB N="33" REF="36" MS="y">
&s;y&s;tem, is the low, but deep and firm founda|tion of all real virtue. But this, as very pain|ful in the practice, and little impo&s;ing in the appearance, they have totally di&s;carded. Their object is to merge all natural and all &s;ocial &s;en|timent in inordinate vanity. In a &s;mall degree, and conver&s;ant in little things, vanity is of little moment. When full grown, it is the wor&s;t of vices, and the occa&s;ional mimick of them all. It makes the whole man fal&s;e. It leaves no|thing &s;incere or tru&s;t-worthy about him. His be&s;t qualities are poi&s;oned and perverted by it, and operate exactly as the wor&s;t. When your lords had many writers as immoral as the ob|ject of their &s;tatue (&s;uch as Voltaire and others) they cho&s;e Rou&s;&s;eau; becau&s;e in him that pecu|liar vice which they wi&s;hed to erect into a ruling virtue, was by far the mo&s;t con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>We have had the great profe&s;&s;or and founder of <HI>the philo&s;ophy of vanity</HI> in England. As I had good opportunities of knowing his proceedings almo&s;t from day to day, he left no doubt in my mind, that he entertained no principle either to influence his heart, or to guide his under&s;tand|ing, but <HI>vanity.</HI> With this vice he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to a degree little &s;hort of madne&s;s. It is from the &s;ame deranged eccentric vanity, that this, the
<PB N="34" REF="37">
in&s;ane <HI>Socrates</HI> of the National A&s;&s;embly, was impelled to publi&s;h a mad Confe&s;&s;ion of his mad faults, and to attempt a new &s;ort of glory, from bringing hardily to light the ob&s;cure and vulgar vices which we know may &s;ometimes be blended with eminent talents. He has not ob&s;erved on the nature of vanity, who does not know that it is omnivorous; that it has no choice in its food; that it is fond to talk even of its own faults and vices, as what will excite &s;urprize and draw attention, and what will pa&s;s at wor&s;t for openne&s;s and candour. It was this abu&s;e and per|ver&s;ion, which vanity makes even of hypocri&s;y, which has driven Rou&s;&s;eau to record a life not &s;o much as chequered, or &s;potted here and there, with virtues, or even di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;ingle good action. It is &s;uch a life he choo&s;es to offer to the attention of mankind. It is &s;uch a life, that with a wild defiance, he flings in the face of his Creator, whom he acknowledges only to brave. Your A&s;&s;embly, knowing how much more powerful example is found than precept, has cho&s;en this man (by his own ac|count without a &s;ingle virtue) for a model. To him they erect their fir&s;t &s;tatue. From him they commence their &s;eries of honours and di&s;|tinctions.</P>
<P>It is that new-invented virtue which your

ma&s;ters canonize, that led their moral hero con|&s;tantly to exhau&s;t the &s;tores of his powerful rhetoric in the expre&s;&s;ion of univer&s;al benevo|lence; whil&s;t his heart was incapable of har|bouring one &s;park of common parental affection. Benevolence to the whole &s;pecies, and want of feeling for every individual with whom the profe&s;&s;ors come in contact, form the character of the new philo&s;ophy. Setting up for an un&s;ocial independence, this their hero of vanity refu&s;es the ju&s;t price of common labour, as well as the tribute which opulence owes to genius, and which, when paid, honours the giver and the receiver; and then he pleads his beggary as an excu&s;e for his crimes. He melts with tender|ne&s;s for tho&s;e only who touch him by the re|mote&s;t relation, and then, without one natural pang, ca&s;ts away, as a &s;ort of offal and excre|ment, the &s;pawn of his di&s;gu&s;tful amours, and &s;ends his children to the ho&s;pital of foundlings. The bear loves, licks, and forms her young; but bears are not philo&s;ophers. Vanity, however, finds its account in rever&s;ing the train of our na|tural feelings. Thou&s;ands admire the &s;entimental writer; the affectionate father is hardly known in his pari&s;h.</P>

State&s;men, like your pre&s;ent rulers, exi&s;t by every thing which is &s;purious, fictitious, and fal&s;e; by every thing which takes the man from his hou&s;e, and &s;ets him on a &s;tage, which makes him up an artificial creature, with painted theatric &s;entiments, fit to be &s;een by the glare of candle|light, and formed to be contemplated at a due di&s;tance.

<P>The next relation which they regenerate by their &s;tatues to Rou&s;&s;eau, is that which is next in &s;anctity to that of a father.

They &s;y&s;tematically corrupt a very corruptible race, (for &s;ome time a growing nui&s;ance among&s;t you) a &s;et of pert, petulant,
<PB N="38" REF="41">
literators, to whom, in&s;tead of their proper, but &s;e|vere, uno&s;tentatious duties, they a&s;&s;ign the brilliant part of men of wit and plea&s;ure, of gay, young, military &s;parks, and danglers at toilets. They call on the ri&s;ing generation in France, to take a &s;ympathy in the adventures and fortunes, and they endeavour to engage their &s;en&s;ibility on the &s;ide of pedagogues, who betray the mo&s;t awful family tru&s;ts, and vitiate their female pu|pils. They teach the people, that the de|bauchers of virgins, almo&s;t in the arms of their parents, may be &s;afe inmates in their hou&s;e, and even fit guardians of the honour of tho&s;e hu&s;|bands who &s;ucceed legally to the office which the young literators had pre-occupied, without a&s;king leave of law or con&s;cience.</P>

<PB N="39" REF="42">
Rou&s;&s;eau, a writer of great force and vivacity, is totally de&s;titute of ta&s;te in any &s;en&s;e of the word. Your ma&s;ters, who are his &s;cholars, con|ceive that all refinement has an ari&s;tocratic cha|racter. The la&s;t age had exhau&s;ted all its pow|ers in giving a grace and noblene&s;s to our na|tural appetites, and in rai&s;ing them into higher cla&s;s and order than &s;eemed ju&s;tly to belong to them. Through Rou&s;&s;eau, your ma&s;ters are re&s;olved to de&s;troy the&s;e ari&s;tocratic prejudices. The pa&s;&s;ion called love, has &s;o general and powerful an influence; it makes &s;o much of the entertainment, and indeed &s;o much the occupa|tion of that part of life which decides the cha|racter for ever, that the mode and the principles on which it engages the &s;ympathy, and &s;trikes the imagination, become of the utmo&s;t import|ance to the morals and manners of every &s;ociety. Your rulers were well aware of this; and in their &s;y&s;tem of changing your manners to ac|commodate them to their politics, they found nothing &s;o convenient as Rou&s;&s;eau. Through him they teach men to love after the fa&s;hion of philo&s;ophers; that is, they teach to men, to Frenchmen, a love without gallantry; a love without any thing of that fine flower of youth|fulne&s;s and gentility, which places it, if not
<PB N="40" REF="43">
among the virtues, among the ornaments of life. In&s;tead of this pa&s;&s;ion, naturally allied to grace and manners, they infu&s;e into their youth an unfa&s;hioned, indelicate, &s;our, gloomy, fero|cious medley of pedantry and lewdne&s;s; of me|taphy&s;ical &s;peculations, blended with the coar&s;e&s;t &s;en&s;uality. Such is the general morality of the pa&s;&s;ions to be found in their famous philo&s;opher, in his famous work of philo&s;ophic gallantry, the <HI>Noucelle Eloi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>When the fence from the gallantry of pre|ceptors is broken down, and your families are no longer protected by decent pride, and &s;alutary dome&s;tic prejudice, there is but one &s;tep to a frightful corruption. The rulers in the National A&s;&s;embly are in good hopes that the females of the fir&s;t families in France may become an ea&s;y prey to dancing-ma&s;ters, fidlers, pattern-draw|ers, fri&s;eurs, and valets de chambre, and other active citizens of that de&s;cription, who having the entry into your hou&s;es, and being half-do|me&s;ticated by their &s;ituation, may be blended with you by regular and irregular relations. By a law, they have made the&s;e people your equals. By adopting the &s;entiments of Rou&s;&s;eau, they have made them your rivals. In this man|ner, the&s;e great legi&s;lators complete their plan
<PB N="41" REF="44">
of levelling, and e&s;tabli&s;h their rights of men on a &s;ure foundation.</P>
<P>I am certain that the writings of Rou&s;&s;eau lead directly to this kind of &s;hameful evil. I have often wondered how he comes to be &s;o much more admired and followed on the conti|tinent than he is here. Perhaps a &s;ecret charm in the language may have its &s;hare in this extra|ordinary difference. We certainly perceive, and to a degree we feel, in this writer, a &s;tyle glowing, animated, enthu&s;ia&s;tic; at the &s;ame time that we find it lax, diffu&s;e, and not in the be&s;t ta&s;te of compo&s;ition; all the members of the piece being pretty equally laboured and ex|panded, without any due &s;election or &s;ubordi|nation of parts. He is generally too much on the &s;tretch, and his manner has little variety. We cannot re&s;t upon any of his works, though they contain ob&s;ervations which occa&s;ionally di&s;|cover a con&s;iderable in&s;ight into human nature. But his doctrines, on the whole, are &s;o inappli|cable to real life and manners, that we never dream of drawing from them any rule for laws or conduct, or for fortifying or illu&s;trating any thing by a reference to his opinions. They have with us the fate of older paradoxes,
<Q><L>Cum ventum ad <HI>verum</HI> e&s;t <HI>&s;en&s;us more&s;que</HI> repugnant,</L>
<L>Atque ip&s;a utilitas ju&s;ti prope mater et aequi.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="45">Perhaps bold &s;peculations are more acceptable, becau&s;e more new to you than to us, who have been long &s;ince &s;atiated with them. We con|tinue, as in the two la&s;t ages, to read more gene|rally, than I believe is now done on the continent, the authors of &s;ound antiquity. The&s;e occupy our minds. They give us another ta&s;te and turn; and will not &s;uffer us to be more than tran&s;iently amu&s;ed with paradoxical morality. It is not that I con&s;ider this writer as wholly de&s;titute of ju&s;t notions. Among&s;t his irregula|rities, it mu&s;t be reckoned, that he is &s;ometimes moral, and moral in a very &s;ublime &s;train. But the <HI>general &s;pirit and tendency</HI> of his works is mi&s;chie|vous; and the more mi&s;chievous for this mix|ture: For, perfect depravity of &s;entiment is not reconcileable with eloquence; and the mind (though corruptible, not complexionally vitious) would reject and throw off with di&s;gu&s;t, a le&s;&s;on of pure and unmixed evil. The&s;e writers make even virtue a pander to vice.</P>
<P>However, I le&s;s con&s;ider the author, than the &s;y&s;tem of the A&s;&s;embly in perverting morality, through his means. This I confe&s;s makes me nearly de&s;pair of any attempt upon the minds of their followers, through rea&s;on, honour, or con&s;cience. The great object of your tyrants,
<PB N="43" REF="46">
is to de&s;troy the gentlemen of France; and for that purpo&s;e they de&s;troy, to the be&s;t of their power, all the effect of tho&s;e relations which may render con&s;iderable men powerful or even &s;afe. To de&s;troy that order, they vitiate the whole community. That no means may exi&s;t of confederating again&s;t their tyranny, by the fal&s;e &s;ympathies of this Nouvelle Eloi&s;e, they endeavour to &s;ubvert tho&s;e principles of do|me&s;tic tru&s;t and fidelity, which form the di&s;ci|pline of &s;ocial life. They propagate principles by which every &s;ervant may think it, if not his duty, at lea&s;t his privilege, to betray his ma&s;ter. By the&s;e principles, every con&s;iderable father of a family lo&s;es the &s;anctuary of his hou&s;e. <HI>Debet &s;ua cuique domus e&s;&s;e perfugium tu ti&s;&s;imum,</HI> &s;ays the law, which your legi&s;lators have taken &s;o much pains fir&s;t to decry, then to repeal. They de|&s;troy all the tranquillity and &s;ecurity of dome&s;tic life; turning the a&s;ylum of the hou&s;e into a gloomy pri&s;on, where the father of the family mu&s;t drag out a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence, endangered in proportion to the apparent means of his &s;afety; where he is wor&s;e than &s;olitary in a croud of dome&s;tics, and more apprehen&s;ive from his &s;ervants and inmates, than from the hired blood-thir&s;ty

mob without doors, who are ready to pull him to the lanterne.</P>
<P>It is thus, and for the &s;ame end, that they endeavour to de&s;troy that tribunal of con&s;cience which exi&s;ts independently of edicts and decrees. Your de&s;pots govern by terror. They know, that he who fears God fears nothing el&s;e; and therefore they eradicate from the mind, through their Voltaire, their Helvetius, and the re&s;t of that infamous gang, that only &s;ort of fear which generates true courage. Their object is, that their fellow citizens may be under the dominion of no awe, but that of their committee of re|&s;earch, and of their lanterne.</P>
<P>Having found the advantage of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination in the formation of their tyranny, it is the grand re&s;ource in which they tru&s;t for the &s;upport of it. Whoever oppo&s;es any of their proceedings, or is &s;u&s;pected of a de&s;ign to oppo&s;e them, is to an&s;wer it with his life, or the lives of his wife and chil|dren. This infamous, cruel, and cowardly practice of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, they have the impudence to call <HI>merciful.</HI> They boa&s;t that they have operated their u&s;urpation rather by terror than by force; and that a few &s;ea&s;onable murders have prevented the blood&s;hed of many battles. There is no
<PB N="45" REF="48">
doubt they will extend the&s;e acts of mercy when|ever they &s;ee an occa&s;ion. Dreadful, however, will be the con&s;equences of their attempt to avoid the evils of war, by the merciful policy of murder. If, by effectual puni&s;hment of the guilty, they do not wholly di&s;avow that practice, and the threat of it too, as any part of their policy; if ever a foreign prince enters into France, he mu&s;t enter it as into a country of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. The mode of civilized war will not be practi&s;ed: nor are the French who act on the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem entitled to expect it. They, who&s;e known policy it is to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate every citizen whom they &s;u&s;pect to be di&s;contented by their tyranny, and to corrupt the &s;oldiery of every open enemy, mu&s;t look for no modified ho&s;tility. All war, which is not battle, will be military execution. This will beget acts of retaliation from you; and every retaliation will beget a new revenge. The hell-hounds of war, on all &s;ides, will be uncoupled and unmuzzled. The new &s;chool of murder and barbari&s;m, &s;et up in Paris, having de&s;troyed (&s;o far as in it lies) all the other manners and principles which have hitherto civilized Europe, will de&s;troy al&s;o the mode of civilized war, which, more than any thing el&s;e, has di&s;tingui&s;hed the Chri&s;tian world.

<P>In &s;uch a &s;ituation of your political, your civil, and your &s;ocial morals and manners, how can you be hurt by the freedom of any di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion? Caution is for tho&s;e who have &s;omething to lo&s;e. What I have &s;aid to ju&s;tify my&s;elf in not apprehending any ill con&s;equence from a free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the ab&s;urd con&s;equences which flow from the relation of the lawful King to the u&s;urped con&s;titution, will apply to my vindica|tion with regard to the expo&s;ure I have made of the &s;tate of the army under the &s;ame &s;ophi&s;tic u&s;urpation. The pre&s;ent tyrants want no argu|ments to prove, what they mu&s;t daily feel, that no good army can exi&s;t on their principles. They are in no want of a monitor to &s;ugge&s;t to them the policy of getting rid of the army, as well as of the King, whenever they are in a condition to effect that mea&s;ure. What hopes may be entertained of your army for the re&s;tora|tion of your liberties, I know not. At pre&s;ent, yielding obedience to the pretended orders of a King, who, they are perfectly appri&s;ed, has no will, and who never can i&s;&s;ue a mandate, which is not intended, in the fir&s;t operation, or

<P>You a&s;k me what I think of the conduct of General Monk. How this affects your ca&s;e, I cannot tell. I doubt whether you po&s;&s;e&s;s, in France, any per&s;ons of a capacity to &s;erve the French monarchy in the &s;ame manner in which Monk &s;erved the monarchy of England. The army which Monk commanded had been form|ed by Cromwell to a perfection of di&s;cipline which perhaps has never been exceeded. That army was be&s;ides of an excellent compo&s;ition. The &s;oldiers were men of extraordinary piety after their mode, of the greate&s;t regularity, and even &s;everity of manners; brave in the field, but mode&s;t, quiet and orderly, in their quarters; men who abhorred the idea of a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inating their officers or any other per&s;ons; and who (they at lea&s;t who &s;erved in this i&s;land) were firmly attached to tho&s;e generals, by whom they were well treated and ably com|manded. Such an army, once gained, might be depended on. I doubt much, if you could
<PB N="48" REF="51">
now find a Monk, whether a Monk could find, in France, &s;uch an army.</P>
<P>I certainly agree with you, that in all proba|bility we owe our whole con&s;titution to the re&s;toration of the Engli&s;h monarchy. The &s;tate of things from which Monk relieved England, was however by no means, at that time, &s;o de|plorable in any &s;en&s;e, as yours is now, and un|der the pre&s;ent &s;way is likely to continue. Cromwell had delivered England from anarchy. His government, though military and de&s;potic, had been regular and orderly. Under the iron, and under the yoke, the &s;oil yielded its produce. After his death, the evils of anar|chy were rather dreaded than felt. Every man was yet &s;afe in his hou&s;e and in his property. But it mu&s;t be admitted, that Monk freed this nation from great and ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions both of future anarchy and of probable tyranny in &s;ome form or other. The king whom he gave us was indeed the very rever&s;e of your benignant &s;o|vereign, who in reward for his attempt to be&s;tow liberty on his &s;ubjects, langui&s;hes him&s;elf in pri|&s;on. The per&s;on given to us by Monk was a man without any &s;en&s;e of his duty as a prince; without any regard to the dignity of his crown;
<PB N="49" REF="52">
without any love to his people; di&s;&s;olute, fal&s;e, venal, and de&s;titute of any po&s;itive good qua|lity what&s;oever, except a plea&s;ant temper, and the manners of a gentleman. Yet the re&s;tora|tion of our monarchy, even in the per&s;on of &s;uch a prince, was every thing to us; for without monarchy in England, mo&s;t certainly we never can enjoy either peace or liberty. It was under this conviction that the very fir&s;t regular &s;tep which we took on the Revolution of 1688, was to fill the throne with a real king; and even before it could be done in due form, the chiefs of the nation did not attempt them&s;elves to exer|ci&s;e authority &s;o much as by <HI>interim.</HI> They in|&s;tantly reque&s;ted the Prince of Orange to take the government on him&s;elf. The throne was not effectively vacant for an hour.</P>

Your zeal, Sir, in &s;tanding &s;o firmly for it as you have done, &s;hews not only a &s;acred re&s;pect for your honour and fidelity, but a well-informed attachment to the real wel|fare and true liberties of your country. I have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf ill, if I have given you cau&s;e to imagine, that I prefer the conduct of tho&s;e who have retired from this warfare to your beha|viour, who, with a courage and con&s;tancy almo&s;t

<P>The fault of Mr. Mounier and Mr. Lally was very great; but it was very general.

No, Sir, I faith|fully a&s;&s;ure you, my re&s;erve is owing to no &s;uch cau&s;es. Is this letter, &s;welled to a &s;econd book, a mark of national antipathy, or even of na|tional indifference? I &s;hould act altogether in the &s;pirit of the &s;ame caution, in a &s;imilar &s;tate of our own dome&s;tic affairs. If I were to venture any advice, in any ca&s;e, it would be my be&s;t. The &s;acred duty of an advi&s;er (one of the mo&s;t inviolable that exi&s;ts) would lead me, towards a real enemy, to act as if my be&s;t friend were the party concerned. But I dare not ri&s;que a &s;peculation with no better view of your affairs than at pre&s;ent I can command; my caution is not from di&s;regard, but from &s;ollicitude for your welfare. It is &s;ugge&s;ted &s;olely from my dread of becoming the author of incon&s;iderate coun&s;el.</P>
<P>It is not, that as this &s;trange &s;eries of actions has pa&s;&s;ed before my eyes, I have not indulged my mind in a great variety of political &s;pecula|tions concerning them. But compelled by no &s;uch po&s;itive duty as does not permit me to evade an opinion; called upon by no ruling

<P>Permit me to &s;ay, that if I were as confident, as I ought to be diffident in my own loo&s;e, ge|neral ideas, I never &s;hould venture to broach them, if but at twenty leagues di&s;tance from the centre of your affairs. I mu&s;t &s;ee with my own eyes, I mu&s;t, in a manner, touch with my own hands, not only the fixed, but the momentary circum&s;tances, before I could venture to &s;ugge&s;t any political project what&s;oever. I mu&s;t know the power and di&s;po&s;ition to accept, to execute, to per&s;evere. I mu&s;t &s;ee all the aids, and all the ob&s;tacles. I mu&s;t &s;ee the means of correcting the plan, where correctives would be wanted. I mu&s;t &s;ee the things; I mu&s;t &s;ee the men. Without a concurrence and adaptation of the&s;e to the de&s;ign, the very be&s;t &s;peculative projects might become not only u&s;ele&s;s, but mi&s;chievous. Plans mu&s;t be made for men.

They do not always an&s;wer to their reputation when you approach them. Nay, the per&s;pec|tive varies, and &s;hews them quite otherwi&s;e than you thought them.

<P>To illu&s;trate the mi&s;chief of a wi&s;e plan, with|out any attention to means and circum&s;tances, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to go farther than to your recent hi&s;tory. In the condition in which France was found three years ago, what better &s;y&s;tem could be propo&s;ed, what le&s;s, even &s;avouring of wild theory, what fitter to provide for all the exigen|cies, whil&s;t it reformed all the abu&s;es of go|vernment, than the convention of the States General? I think nothing better could be ima|gined.
<PB N="59" REF="62">
But I have cen&s;ured, and do &s;till pre|&s;ume to cen&s;ure your Parliament of Paris, for not having &s;ugge&s;ted to the King, that this pro|per mea&s;ure was of all mea&s;ures the mo&s;t cri|tical and arduous; one in which the utmo&s;t cir|cum&s;pection, and the greate&s;t number of pre|cautions, were the mo&s;t ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The very confe&s;&s;ion that a government wants either amendment in its conformation, or relief to great di&s;tre&s;s, cau&s;es it to lo&s;e half its reputa|tion, and as great a proportion of its &s;trength as depends upon that reputation. It was there|fore nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t to put government out of danger, whil&s;t at its own de&s;ire it &s;uffered &s;uch an operation, as a general reform at the hands of tho&s;e who were much more filled with a &s;en&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, than provided with rational means of a cure.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that this care, and the&s;e pre|cautions, were more naturally the duty of the King's mini&s;ters, than that of the Parliament. They were &s;o; but every man mu&s;t an&s;wer in his e&s;timation for the advice he gives, when he puts the conduct of his mea&s;ure into hands who he does not know will execute his plans according to his ideas. Three or four mini&s;ters were not to be tru&s;ted with the being of the French mo|narchy,
<PB N="60" REF="63">
of all the orders, and of all the di&s;|tinctions, and all the property of the kingdom. What mu&s;t be the prudence of tho&s;e who could think, in the then known temper of the people of Paris, of a&s;&s;embling the &s;tates at a place &s;ituated as Ver&s;ailles?</P>
<P>The Parliament of Paris did wor&s;e than to in&s;pire this blind confidence into the King. For, as if names were things, they took no notice of (indeed they rather countenanced) the deviations which were manife&s;t in the execution, from the true antient principles of the plan which they recommended. The&s;e deviations (as guardians of the antient laws, u&s;ages, and con&s;titution of the kingdom) the Parliament of Paris ought not to have &s;uffered, without the &s;tronge&s;t re|mon&s;trances to the throne. It ought to have &s;ounded the alarm to the whole nation, as it had often done on things of infinitely le&s;s importance. Under pretence of re&s;u&s;citating the antient con|&s;titution, the Parliament &s;aw one of the &s;tronge&s;t acts of innovation, and the mo&s;t leading in its con&s;equences, carried into effect before their eyes; and an innovation through the medium of de&s;poti&s;m; that is, they &s;uffered the King's mi|ni&s;ters to new model the whole repre&s;entation of the <HI>Tiers Etat,</HI> and, in a great mea&s;ure, that of the
<PB N="61" REF="64">
clergy too, and to de&s;troy the antient propor|tions of the orders. The&s;e changes, unque&s;|tionably the King had no right to make; and here the Parliaments failed in their duty, and along with their country, have peri&s;hed by this failure.</P>
<P>What a number of faults have led to this multitude of misfortunes, and almo&s;t all from this one &s;ource, that of con&s;idering certain ge|neral maxims, without attending to circum|&s;tances, to times, to places, to conjunctures, and to actors! If we do not attend &s;crupulou&s;ly to all the&s;e, the medicine of to-day becomes the poi&s;on of to-morrow. If any mea&s;ure was in the ab&s;tract better than another, it was to call the &s;tates&mdash;<HI>ea vi&s;a &s;alus morientibus una.</HI>&mdash;Cer|tainly it had the appearance.&mdash;But &s;ee the con&s;e|quences of not attending to critical moments, of not regarding the &s;ymptoms which di&s;crimi|nate di&s;ea&s;es, and which di&s;tingui&s;h con&s;titutions, complexions, and humours.

Thus the potion which was given to &s;trengthen the con&s;titution, to heal divi&s;ions, and to com|po&s;e
<PB N="62" REF="65">
the minds of men, became the &s;ource of debility, phrenzy, di&s;cord, and utter di&s;&s;olu|tion.</P>
<P>In this, perhaps, I have an&s;wered, I think, an|other of your que&s;tions&mdash;Whether the Briti&s;h con&s;titution is adapted to your circum&s;tances? When I prai&s;ed the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and wi&s;hed it to be well &s;tudied, I did not mean that its exterior form and po&s;itive arrangement &s;hould become a model for you, or for any people &s;er|vilely to copy. I meant to recommend the <HI>principles</HI> from which it has grown, and the po|licy on which it has been progre&s;&s;ively improved out of elements common to you and to us. I am &s;ure it is no vi&s;ionary theory of mine. It is not an advice that &s;ubjects you to the hazard of any experiment. I believed the antient princi|ples to be wi&s;e in all ca&s;es of a large empire that would be free. I thought you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed our principles in your old forms, in as great a perfection as we did originally. If your &s;tates agreed (as I think they did) with your circum&s;tances, they were be&s;t for you. As you had a con&s;titution formed upon principles &s;imilar to ours, my idea was, that you might have im|proved them as we have done, conforming them to the &s;tate and exigencies of the times,
<PB N="63" REF="66">
and the condition of property in your country, having the con&s;ervation of that property, and the &s;ub&s;tantial ba&s;is of your monarchy, as prin|cipal objects in all your reforms.</P>
<P>I do not advi&s;e an Hou&s;e of Lords to you. Your antient cour&s;e by repre&s;entatives of the Noble&s;&s;e (in your circum&s;tances) appears to me rather a better in&s;titution. I know, that with you, a &s;et of men of rank have betrayed their con&s;tituents, their honour, their tru&s;t, their King, and their country, and levelled them|&s;elves with their footmen, that through this de|gradation they might afterwards put them&s;elves above their natural equals. Some of the&s;e per&s;ons have entertained a project, that in re|ward of this their black perfidy and corruption, they may be cho&s;en to give ri&s;e to a new order, and to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves into an Hou&s;e of Lords. Do you think that, under the name of a Briti&s;h con&s;titution, I mean to recommend to you &s;uch Lords, made of &s;uch kind of &s;tuff? I do not however include in this de&s;cription all of tho&s;e who are fond of this &s;cheme.</P>
<P>If you were now to form &s;uch an Hou&s;e of Peers, it would bear, in my opinion, but little re&s;emblance to our's in its origin, character, or the purpo&s;es which it might an&s;wer, at the &s;ame
<PB N="64" REF="67">
time that it would de&s;troy your true natural no|bility. But if you are not in a condition to frame an Hou&s;e of Lords, &s;till le&s;s are you ca|pable, in my opinion, of framing any thing which virtually and &s;ub&s;tantially could be an|&s;werable (for the purpo&s;es of a &s;table, regular government) to our Hou&s;e of Commons. That Hou&s;e is, within it&s;elf, a much more &s;ubtle and artificial combination of parts and powers, than people are generally aware of. What knits it to the other members of the con&s;titution; what fits it to be at once the great &s;upport, and the great con|troul of government; what makes it of &s;uch admirable &s;ervice to that monarchy which, if it limits, it &s;ecures and &s;trengthens, would require a long di&s;cour&s;e, belonging to the lei&s;ure of a contemplative man, not to one who&s;e duty it is to join in communicating practically to the people the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;uch a con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Your <HI>Tiers Etat</HI> was not in effect and &s;ub|&s;tance an Hou&s;e of Commons. You &s;tood in ab&s;o|lute need of &s;omething el&s;e to &s;upply the manife&s;t defects in &s;uch a body as your Tiers Etat. On a &s;ober and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate view of your old con&s;titution, as connected with all the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, I was fully per&s;uaded, that the crown, &s;tanding as things have &s;tood (and are likely to &s;tand, if you
<PB N="65" REF="68">
are to have any monarchy at all) was and is inca|pable, alone and by it&s;elf, of holding a ju&s;t balance between the two orders, and at the &s;ame time of effecting the interior and exterior purpo&s;es of a protecting government. I, who&s;e leading prin|ciple it is, in a reformation of the &s;tate, to make u&s;e of exi&s;ting materials, am of opinion, that the re|pre&s;entation of the clergy, as a &s;eparate order, was an in&s;titution which touched all the orders more nearly than any of them touched the other; that it was well fitted to connect them; and to hold a place in any wi&s;e monarchical common|wealth. If I refer you to your original con&s;ti|tution, and think it, as I do, &s;ub&s;tantially a good one, I do not amu&s;e you in this, more than in other things, with any inventions of mine. A certain intemperance of intellect is the di&s;ea&s;e of the time, and the &s;ource of all its other di&s;|ea&s;es. I will keep my&s;elf as untainted by it as I can. Your architects build without a foun|dation. I would readily lend an helping hand to any &s;uper&s;tructure, when once this is effectually &s;ecured&mdash;but fir&s;t I would &s;ay <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P>You think, Sir, and you may think rightly, upon the fir&s;t view of the theory, that to provide for the exigencies of an empire, &s;o &s;ituated and &s;o related as that of France, its King ought to be inve&s;ted
<PB N="66" REF="69">
with powers very much &s;uperior to tho&s;e which the King of England po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es under the letter of our con&s;titution. Every degree of power ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the &s;tate, and not de&s;tructive to the rational and moral freedom of individuals, to that per&s;onal liberty, and per&s;onal &s;ecurity, which contribute &s;o much to the vigour, the pro&s;perity, the happine&s;s, and the dignity of a nation&mdash;every degree of power which does not &s;uppo&s;e the total ab&s;ence of all control, and all re&s;pon&s;ibility on the part of mini&s;ters,&mdash;a King of France, in common &s;en&s;e, ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s. But whether the exact mea&s;ure of authority, a&s;&s;igned by the letter of the law to the King of Great Britain, can an&s;wer to the exterior or interior purpo&s;es of the French monarchy, is a point which I cannot venture to judge upon. Here, both in the power given, and its limitations, we have always cautiou&s;ly felt our way. The parts of our con&s;titution have gradually, and almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly, in a long cour&s;e of time, accommodated them&s;elves to each other, and to their common, as well as to their &s;eparate purpo&s;es. But this adaptation of contending parts, as it has not been in our's, &s;o it can never be in your's, or in any country, the effect of a &s;ingle in&s;tantaneous re|gulation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> could ever think of doing it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="70">I believe, Sir, that many on the continent al|together mi&s;take the condition of a King of Great Britain. He is a real King, and not an execu|tive officer. If he will not trouble him&s;elf with contemptible details, nor wi&s;h to degrade him|&s;elf by becoming a party in little &s;quabbles, I am far from &s;ure, that a King of Great Britain, in whatever concerns him as a King, or indeed as a rational man, who combines his public in|tere&s;t with his per&s;onal &s;atisfaction, does not po&s;&s;e&s;s a more real, &s;olid, exten&s;ive power, than the King of France was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of before this mi&s;erable Revolution. The direct power of the King of England is con&s;iderable. His indirect, and far more certain power, is great indeed. He &s;tands in need of nothing towards dignity; of nothing towards &s;plendour; of nothing to|wards authority; of nothing at all towards con|&s;ideration abroad. When was it that a King of England wanted wherewithal to make him re&s;pected, courted, or perhaps even feared in every &s;tate in Europe?</P>
<P>I am con&s;tantly of opinion, that your &s;tates, in three orders, on the footing on which they &s;tood in 1614, were capable of being brought into a proper and harmonious combination with royal authority. This con&s;titution by e&s;tates,
<PB N="68" REF="71">
was the natural, and only ju&s;t repre&s;entation of France. It grew out of the habitual condi|tions, relations, and reciprocal claims of men. It grew out of the circum&s;tances of the country, and out of the &s;tate of property. The wretched &s;cheme of your pre&s;ent ma&s;ters, is not to fit the con&s;titution to the people, but wholly to de&s;troy conditions, to di&s;&s;olve relations, to change the &s;tate of the nation, and to &s;ubvert property, in order to fit their country to their theory of a con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Until you could make out practically that great work, a combination of oppo&s;ing forces, <Q REND="inline">"a work of labour long, and endle&s;s prai&s;e,"</Q> the utmo&s;t caution ought to have been u&s;ed in the reduction of the royal power, which alone was capable of holding together the comparatively heterogeneous ma&s;s of your &s;tates. But at this day, all the&s;e con&s;iderations are un&s;ea&s;onable. To what end &s;hould we di&s;cu&s;s the limitations of royal power? Your king is in pri&s;on. Why &s;peculate on the mea&s;ure and &s;tandard of liber|ty? I doubt much, very much indeed, whether France is at all ripe for liberty on any &s;tandard. Men are qualified for civil liberty, in exact pro|portion to their di&s;po&s;ition to put moral chains upon their own appetites; in proportion as their
<PB N="69" REF="72" MS="y">
love to ju&s;tice is above their rapacity; in pro|portion as their &s;oundne&s;s and &s;obriety of under|&s;tanding is above their vanity and pre&s;umption; in proportion as they are more di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to the coun&s;els of the wi&s;e and good, in pre|ference to the flattery of knaves. Society can|not exi&s;t unle&s;s a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed &s;omewhere, and the le&s;s of it there is within, the more there mu&s;t be without. It is ordained in the eternal con|&s;titution of things, that men of intemperate minds cannot be free. Their pa&s;&s;ions forge their fetters.</P>
<P>This &s;entence the prevalent part of your countrymen execute on them&s;elves. They po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, not long &s;ince, what was next to free|dom, a mild paternal monarchy. They de&s;pi&s;ed it for its weakne&s;s. They were offered a well-poi&s;ed free con&s;titution. It did not &s;uit their ta&s;te or their temper. They carved for them|&s;elves; they flew out, murdered, robbed, and rebelled. They have &s;ucceeded, and put over their country an in&s;olent tyranny, made up of cruel and inexorable ma&s;ters, and that too of a de&s;cription hitherto not known in the world. The powers and policies by which they have &s;ucceeded, are not tho&s;e of great &s;tate&s;men, or
<PB N="70" REF="73">
great military commanders, but the practices of incendiaries, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, hou&s;ebreakers, robbers, &s;preaders of fal&s;e news, forgers of fal&s;e orders from authority, and other delinquencies, of which ordinary ju&s;tice takes cognizance. Accordingly the &s;pirit of their rule is exactly corre&s;pondent to the means by which they obtained it. They act more in the manner of thieves who have got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an hou&s;e, than of conquerors who have &s;ubdued a nation.</P>

They are not hone&s;t; they are only ineffectual and un&s;y&s;tematic in their

iniquity. They are per&s;ons who want not the di&s;po&s;itions, but the energy and vigour, that is nece&s;&s;ary for great evil machinations. They find that in &s;uch de&s;igns they fall at be&s;t into a &s;econdary rank, and others take the place and lead in u&s;urpation, which they are not qualified to obtain or to hold. They envy to their com|panions, the natural fruit of their crimes; they join to run them down with the hue and cry of mankind, which pur&s;ues their common offences; and then hope to mount into their places on the credit of the &s;obriety with which they &s;hew them&s;elves di&s;po&s;ed to carry on what may &s;eem mo&s;t plau&s;ible in the mi&s;chievous projects they pur&s;ue in common.

the &s;corn of both parties; &s;ometimes the tool, &s;ometimes the incumbrance of that, who&s;e views they approve, who&s;e conduct they de|cry. The&s;e people are only made to be the &s;port of tyrants. They never can obtain, or communicate freedom.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me too, whether we have a com|mittee of re&s;earch. No, Sir,&mdash;God forbid! It is the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;trument of tyranny and u&s;urpa|tion; and therefore I do not wonder that it has had an early e&s;tabli&s;hment under your pre&s;ent Lords. We do not want it.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e my length. I have been &s;omewhat occupied, &s;ince I was honoured with your letter; and I &s;hould not have been able to an&s;wer it at all, but for the holidays, which have given me means of enjoying the lei&s;ure of the country. I am called to duties which I am neither able nor willing to evade. I mu&s;t &s;oon return to my old conflict with the corruptions and op|pre&s;&s;ions which have prevailed in our ea&s;tern dominions. I mu&s;t turn my&s;elf wholly from tho&s;e of France.</P>
<P>In England, we <HI>cannot</HI> work &s;o hard as French|men. Frequent relaxation is nece&s;&s;ary to us. You are naturally more inten&s;e in your applica|tion. I did not know this part of your national

character, until I went into France in 1773. At pre&s;ent, this your di&s;po&s;ition to labour is rather encrea&s;ed than le&s;&s;ened. In your A&s;&s;em|bly you do not allow your&s;elves a rece&s;s even on Sundays. We have two days in the week, be|&s;ides the fe&s;tivals; and be&s;ides five or &s;ix months of the &s;ummer and autumn. This continued unremitted effort of the members of your A&s;|&s;embly, I take to be one among the cau&s;es of the mi&s;chief they have done. They who always labour, can have no true judgment. You never give your&s;elves time to cool. You can never &s;urvey, from its proper point of &s;ight, the work you have fini&s;hed, before you decree its final execution. You can never plan the future by the pa&s;t. You never go into the country, &s;oberly and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately to ob&s;erve the effect of your mea&s;ures on their objects. You can|not feel di&s;tinctly how far the people are rendered better and improved, or more mi&s;erable and de|praved, by what you have done. You can|not &s;ee with your own eyes the &s;ufferings and afflictions you cau&s;e. You know them but at a di&s;tance, on the &s;tatements of tho&s;e who always flatter the reigning power, and who, amid&s;t their repre&s;entations of the grievances, inflame your
<PB N="74" REF="77">
minds again&s;t tho&s;e who are oppre&s;&s;ed. The&s;e are among&s;t the effects of unremitted labour, when men exhau&s;t their attention, burn out their can|dles, and are left in the dark.&mdash;<HI>Malo meorum negligentiam, quam i&s;torum ob&s;curam diligentiam.</HI></P>
