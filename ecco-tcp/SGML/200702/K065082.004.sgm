<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. <HI>Julian is declared Emperor by the Legions of Gaul.&mdash;His March and Succe&s;s.&mdash;The Death of Con&s;tan|tius.&mdash;Civil Admini&s;tration of Julian.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHILE the Romans langui&s;hed under the ignominious tyranny of eunuchs and bi&s;hops, the prai&s;es of Julian were <NOTE PLACE="marg">The jea|lou&s;y of Con&s;tan|tius again&s;t Julian.</NOTE> repeated with tran&s;port in every part of the empire, except in the palace of Con&s;tantius. The Barbarians of Germany had felt, and &s;till dreaded, the arms of the young Cae&s;ar; his &s;ol|diers were the companions of his victory; the grateful provincials enjoyed the ble&s;&s;ings of his reign; but the favourites, who had oppo&s;ed his elevation, were offended by his virtues; and they ju&s;tly con&s;idered the friend of the people as the enemy of the court. As long as the fame
<PB N="2" REF="9">
of Julian was doubtful, the buffoons of the palace, who were &s;killed in the language of &s;a|tire, tried the efficacy of tho&s;e arts which they had &s;o often practi&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s. They ea&s;ily di&s;covered, that his &s;implicity was not exempt from affectation: the ridiculous epithets of an hairy &s;avage, of an ape inve&s;ted with the purple, were applied to the dre&s;s and per&s;on of the phi|lo&s;ophic warrior; and his mode&s;t di&s;patches were &s;tigmatized as the vain and elaborate fictions of a loquacious Greek, a &s;peculative &s;oldier, who had &s;tudied the art of war amid&s;t the groves of the academy <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Omnes qui plus poterant in palatio, adulandi profe&s;&s;ores jam docti, recte con&s;ulta, pro&s;pereque completa vertebant in deridicu|lum: talia &s;ine modo &s;trepentes in&s;ul&s;e; in odium venit cum vic|toriis &s;uis; capella, non homo; ut hir&s;utum Julianum carpentes, appellante&s;que loquacem talpam, et purpuratam &s;imiam, et litterio|nem Graecum: et his congruentia plurima atque vernacula principi re&s;onantes, audire haec taliaque ge&s;tienti, virtutes ejus obruere verbis impudentibus conabantur, ut &s;egnem ince&s;&s;entes et timidum et um|bratilem, ge&s;taque &s;ecus verbis comptioribus exornantem. Ammi|anus, xvii. 11.</NOTE>. The voice of malicious folly was at length &s;ilenced by the &s;houts of victory; the conqueror of the Franks and Alemanni could no longer be painted as an object of contempt; and the monarch him&s;elf was meanly ambitious of &s;tealing from his lieutenant the honourable reward of his labours. In the letters crowned with laurel, which, according to ancient cu&s;tom, were addre&s;&s;ed to the provinces, the name of Julian was omitted. <Q>Con&s;tantius had made his di&s;po&s;itions in per&s;on; <HI>he</HI> had &s;ignalized his valour in the foremo&s;t ranks; <HI>his</HI> military
<PB N="3" REF="10">
conduct had &s;ecured the victory; and the captive king of the Barbarians was pre&s;ented to <HI>him</HI> on the field of battle,</Q> from which he was at that time di&s;tant above forty days jour|ney <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xvi. 12. The orator Themi&s;tius (iv. p. 56, 57.) believed whatever was contained in the Imperial letters, which were addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;enate of Con&s;tantinople. Aurelius Victor, who publi&s;hed his Abridgment in the la&s;t year of Con&s;tantius, a&s;cribes the German victories to the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> of the emperor, and the <HI>fortune</HI> of the Cae&s;ar. Yet the hi&s;torian, &s;oon afterwards, was indebted to the favour or e&s;teem of Julian for the honour of a bra&s;s &s;tatue; and the important offices of con&s;ular of the &s;econd Pannonia, and praefect of the city. Ammian. xxi. 10.</NOTE>. So extravagant a fable was incapable, however, of deceiving the public credulity, or even of &s;atisfying the pride of the emperor him|&s;elf. Secretly con&s;cious that the applau&s;e and favour of the Romans accompanied the ri&s;ing fortunes of Julian, his di&s;contented mind was prepared to receive the &s;ubtle poi&s;on of tho&s;e artful &s;ycophants, who coloured their mi&s;chiev|ous de&s;igns with the faire&s;t appearances of truth and candour <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Callido nocendi artificio, accu&s;atoriam diritatem laudum titulis peragebant. . . Hae voces fuerunt ad in&s;lammanda odia probris om|nibus potentiores. See Mamertin. in Actione Gratiarum in Vet. Panegyr. xi. 5, 6.</NOTE>. In&s;tead of depreciating the me|rits of Julian, they acknowledged, and even ex|aggerated, his popular fame, &s;uperior talents, and important &s;ervices. But they darkly in&s;i|nuated, that the virtues of the Cae&s;ar might in|&s;tantly be converted into the mo&s;t dangerous crimes; if the incon&s;tant multitude &s;hould pre|fer their inclinations to their duty; or if the general of a victorious army &s;hould be tempted
<PB N="4" REF="11">
from his allegiance by the hopes of revenge, and independent greatne&s;s. The per&s;onal fears of Con&s;tantius were interpreted by his council as <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fears and envy of Con&s;tan|tius.</NOTE> a laudable anxiety for the public &s;afety; whil&s;t in private, and perhaps in his own brea&s;t, he di&s;gui&s;ed, under the le&s;s odious appellation of fear, the &s;entiments of hatred and envy, which he had &s;ecretly conceived for the inimitable virtues of Julian.</P>
<P>The apparent tranquillity of Gaul, and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The le|gions of Gaul are ordered to march into the Ea&s;t, A. D. 360, April.</NOTE> imminent danger of the ea&s;tern provinces, offered a &s;pecious pretence for the de&s;ign which was art|fully concerted by the Imperial mini&s;ters. They re&s;olved to di&s;arm the Cae&s;ar; to recall tho&s;e faithful troops who guarded his per&s;on and dig|nity; and to employ in a di&s;tant war again&s;t the Per&s;ian monarch, the hardy veterans who had vanqui&s;hed, on the banks of the Rhine, the fierce&s;t nations of Germany. While Julian u&s;ed the laborious hours of his winter-quarters at Paris in the admini&s;tration of power, which, in his hands, was the exerci&s;e of virtue, he was &s;urpri&s;ed by the ha&s;ty arrival of a tribune and a notary; with po&s;itive orders from the emperor, which <HI>they</HI> were directed to execute, and <HI>he</HI> was commanded not to oppo&s;e. Con&s;tantius &s;ignified his plea&s;ure, that four entire legions, the Celtae, and Petulants, the Heruli, and the Batavians, &s;hould be &s;eparated from the &s;tandard of Julian, under which they had acquired their fame and di&s;cipline; that in each of the remaining bands, three hundred of the brave&s;t youths &s;hould be

&s;elected; and that this numerous detachment, the &s;trength of the Gallic army, &s;hould in&s;tantly begin their march, and exert their utmo&s;t dili|gence to arrive, before the opening of the cam|paign, on the frontiers of Per&s;ia <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">The minute interval, which may be interpo&s;ed between the <HI>byeme adult&acirc;</HI> and the <HI>primo vere</HI> of Ammianus (xx. 1. 4.), in&s;tead of allowing a &s;ufficient &s;pace for a march of three thou&s;and miles, would render the orders of Con&s;tantius as extravagant as they were unju&s;t. The troops of Gaul could not have reached Syria till the end of autumn. The memory of Ammianus mu&s;t have been inac|curate, and his language incorrect.</NOTE>. The Cae&s;ar fore&s;aw, and lamented, the con&s;equences of this fatal mandate. Mo&s;t of the auxiliaries, who engaged their voluntary &s;ervice, had &s;tipulated, that they &s;hould never be obliged to pa&s;s the Alps. The public faith of Rome, and the per|&s;onal honour of Julian, had been pledged for the ob&s;ervance of this condition. Such an act of treachery and oppre&s;&s;ion would de&s;troy the confidence, and excite the re&s;entment, of the independent warriors of Germany, who con&s;i|dered truth as the noble&s;t of their virtues, and freedom as the mo&s;t valuable of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The legionaries, who enjoyed the title and pri|vileges of Romans, were enli&s;ted for the general defence of the republic; but tho&s;e mercenary troops heard with cold indifference the anti|quated names of the republic and of Rome. Attached, either from birth or long habit, to the climate and manners of Gaul, they loved and admired Julian; they de&s;pi&s;ed, and perhaps hated, the emperor; they dreaded the laborious march, the Per&s;ian arrows, and the burning de|&s;erts

of A&s;ia. They claimed, as their own, the country which they had &s;aved; and excu&s;ed their want of &s;pirit, by pleading the &s;acred and more immediate duty of protecting their families and friends. The apprehen&s;ions of the Gauls were derived from the knowledge of the impending and inevitable danger. As &s;oon as the provinces were exhau&s;ted of their military &s;trength, the Germans would violate a treaty which had been impo&s;ed on their fears; and notwith&s;tanding the abilities and valour of Julian, the general of a nominal army, to whom the public calamities would be imputed, mu&s;t find him&s;elf, after a vain re&s;i&s;tance, either a pri&s;oner in the camp of the Barbarians, or a criminal in the palace of Con&s;tantius. If Julian complied with the orders which he had received, he &s;ub&s;cribed his own de&s;truction, and that of a people who de&s;erved his affection. But a po&s;itive refu&s;al was an act of rebellion, and a declaration of war. The in|exorable jealou&s;y of the emperor, the peremp|tory, and perhaps in&s;idious, nature of his com|mands, left not any room for a fair apology, or candid interpretation; and the dependent &s;tation of the Cae&s;ar &s;carcely allowed him to pau&s;e or to deliberate. Solitude encrea&s;ed the perplexity of Julian; he could no longer apply to the faithful coun&s;els of Sallu&s;t, who had been removed from his office by the judicious malice of the eunuchs: he could not even enforce his repre&s;entations by the concurrence of the mi|ni&s;ters, who would have been afraid, or a&s;hamed,

The latter, a crafty and corrupt &s;tate&s;man, declining to a&s;&s;ume a re&s;pon|&s;ible part on this dangerous occa&s;ion, eluded the pre&s;&s;ing and repeated invitations of Julian, who repre&s;ented to him, that in every important mea|&s;ure, the pre&s;ence of the praefect was indi&s;pen|&s;able in the council of the prince. In the mean while the Cae&s;ar was oppre&s;&s;ed by the rude and importunate &s;olicitations of the Imperial me&s;&s;en|gers, who pre&s;umed to &s;ugge&s;t, that if he ex|pected the return of his mini&s;ters, he would charge him&s;elf with the guilt of the delay, and re&s;erve for them the merit of the execution. Unable to re&s;i&s;t, unwilling to comply, Julian expre&s;&s;ed, in the mo&s;t &s;erious terms, his wi&s;h, and even his intention, of re&s;igning the purple, which he could not pre&s;erve with honour, but which he could not abdicate with &s;afety.</P>

alone was entitled to judge of the public welfare. He i&s;&s;ued the nece&s;&s;ary orders for car|rying into execution the commands of Con&s;tan|tius; a part of the troops began their march for the Alps; and the detachments from the &s;everal garri&s;ons moved towards their re&s;pective places of a&s;&s;embly.

in lively colours, the di&s;grace of the Cae&s;ar, the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Gallic army, and the feeble vices of the tyrant of A&s;ia. The &s;ervants of Con&s;tantius were a&s;toni&s;hed and alarmed by the progre&s;s of this dangerous &s;pirit. They pre&s;&s;ed the Cae&s;ar to ha&s;ten the departure of the troops; but they imprudently rejected the hone&s;t and judicious advice of Julian; who propo&s;ed that they &s;hould not march through Paris, and &s;ug|ge&s;ted the danger and temptation of a la&s;t in|terview.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the approach of the troops was <NOTE PLACE="marg">They pro|claim Ju|lian empo|ror.</NOTE> announced, the Cae&s;ar went out to meet them, and a&s;cended his tribunal, which had been erected in a plain before the gates of the city. After di&s;tingui&s;hing the officers and &s;oldiers, who by their rank or merit de&s;erved a peculiar attention, Julian addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a &s;tudied oration to the &s;urrounding multitude: he cele|brated their exploits with grateful applau&s;e; en|couraged them to accept, with alacrity, the honour of &s;erving under the eyes of a powerful and liberal monarch; and admoni&s;hed them, that the commands of Augu&s;tus required an in|&s;tant and cheerful obedience.

They retired from the fea&s;t, full of grief and perplexity; and lamented the hard&s;hip of their fate, which tore them from their beloved general and their native country. The only expedient which could prevent their &s;eparation was boldly agitated and approved; the popular re&s;entment was in&s;en&s;ibly moulded into a regular con&s;piracy; their ju&s;t rea&s;ons of complaint were heightened by pa&s;&s;ion, and their pa&s;&s;ions were inflamed by wine; as on the eve of their departure, the troops were indulged in licentious fe&s;tivity.

He gave a public and military audience to the quae&s;tor Leonas: the haughty epi&s;tle of Con&s;tan|tius was read to the attentive multitude; and Julian prote&s;ted, with the mo&s;t flattering defe|rence, that he was ready to re&s;ign the title of Augu&s;tus, if he could obtain the con&s;ent of tho&s;e whom he acknowledged as the authors of his elevation.

But the Imperial legions were &s;till in their di&s;tant quarters of A&s;ia; the Da|nube was feebly guarded; and if Julian could occupy, by a &s;udden incur&s;ion, the important provinces of Illyricum, he might expect that a people of &s;oldiers would re&s;ort to his &s;tandard, and that the rich mines of gold and &s;ilver would contribute to the expences of the civil war. He propo&s;ed this bold enterpri&s;e to the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;oldiers; in&s;pired them with a ju&s;t confidence in their general, and in them&s;elves; and exhort|ed them to maintain their reputation, of being terrible to the enemy, moderate to their fellow|citizens, and obedient to their officers.

The oath of fidelity was admini&s;tered; and the &s;oldiers, cla&s;hing their &s;hields, and pointing their drawn &s;words to their throats, devoted them&s;elves, with horrid imprecations, to the &s;ervice of a leader whom they celebrated as the deliverer of Gaul, and the conqueror of the Germans <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">See his oration, and the behaviour of the troops, in Am|mian. xxi. 5.</NOTE>. This &s;olemn engagement, which &s;eemed to be dictated by affection, rather than by duty, was &s;ingly oppo&s;ed by Nebridius, who had been admitted to the office of Praetorian praefect.

The captive general, uncertain of his life or death, was ha&s;tily thrown upon a hor&s;e, and conducted to the pre|&s;ence of Julian; who kindly rai&s;ed him from the ground, and di&s;pelled the terror and amazement which &s;eemed to &s;tupify his faculties. But Lu|cilian had no &s;ooner recovered his &s;pirits, than he betrayed his want of di&s;cretion, by pre&s;uming to admoni&s;h his conqueror, that he had ra&s;hly ventured, with a handful of men, to expo&s;e his per&s;on in the mid&s;t of his enemies. <Q>Re&s;erve for your ma&s;ter Con&s;tantius the&s;e timid remon|&s;trances, replied Julian, with a &s;mile of con|tempt; when I gave you my purple to ki&s;s, I received you not as a coun&s;ellor, but as a &s;uppliant.</Q> Con&s;cious that &s;ucce&s;s alone could ju&s;tify his attempt, and that boldne&s;s only could command &s;ucce&s;s, he in&s;tantly advanced, at the head of three thou&s;and &s;oldiers, to attack the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t populous city of the Illyrian provinces.

The notary Gaudentius had occupied in his name the provinces of Africa; the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of Rome was intercepted; and the di&s;tre&s;s of Julian was increa&s;ed, by an unexpected event, which might have been productive of fatal con&s;equences. Julian had received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of two legions and a cohort of archers, who were &s;tationed at Sirmium; but he &s;u&s;pected, with rea&s;on, the fide|lity of tho&s;e troops, which had been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the emperor; and it was thought expedient, under the pretence of the expo&s;ed &s;tate of the Gallic frontier, to di&s;mi&s;s them from the mo&s;t important &s;cene of action.

The vigilance of Julian per|ceived at once the extent of the mi&s;chief, and the nece&s;&s;ity of applying an immediate remedy. By his order, Jovinus led back a part of the army into Italy; and the &s;iege of Aquileia was formed with diligence, and pro&s;ecuted with vigour.

Eu&s;ebius, and his guilty a&s;&s;ociates, made a faint attempt to prolong the reign of the eunuchs, by the election of another emperor: but their intrigues were rejected with di&s;dain by an army which now abhorred the thought of civil di&s;|cord; and two officers of rank were in&s;tantly di&s;patched, to a&s;&s;ure Julian, that every &s;word in the empire would be drawn for his &s;ervice.

Without &s;hed|ding the blood of his fellow-citizens, he e&s;caped the dangers of a doubtful conflict, and acquired the advantages of a complete victory.

the vegetable kind) left his mind and body always free and active, for the various and important bu&s;ine&s;s of an author, a pontiff, a magi&s;trate, a general, and a prince. In one and the &s;ame day, he gave audience to &s;everal amba&s;&s;adors, and wrote, or dictated, a great number of letters to his generals, his civil magi&s;trates, his private friends, and the different cities of his dominions. He li&s;tened to the memorials which had been received, con&s;idered the &s;ubject of the petitions, and &s;ignified his intentions more rapidly than they could be taken in &s;hort-hand by the dili|gence of his &s;ecretaries. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch flex|ibility of thought, and &s;uch firmne&s;s of attention, that he could employ his hand to write, his ear to li&s;ten, and his voice to dictate; and pur&s;ue at once three &s;everal trains of ideas, without he&s;i|tation, and without error. While his mini&s;ters repo&s;ed, the prince flew with agility from one labour to another, and, after a ha&s;ty dinner, retired into his library, till the public bu&s;ine&s;s, which he had appointed for the evening, &s;um|moned him to interrupt the pro&s;ecution of his &s;tudies. The &s;upper of the emperor was &s;till le&s;s &s;ub&s;tantial than the former meal; his &s;leep was never clouded by the fumes of indige&s;tion; and, except in the &s;hort interval of a marriage, which was the effect of policy rather than love, the cha&s;te Julian never &s;hared his bed with a female companion. <NOTE N="50" PLACE="foot">Lectulus . . .

The wa&s;te of an enormous hou&s;ehold, the encrea&s;e of fees and perqui&s;ites, which were &s;oon claimed as a lawful debt, and the bribes which they extorted from tho&s;e who feared their enmity, or &s;olicited their favour, &s;uddenly enriched the&s;e haughty menials.

Their &s;ilken robes were embroidered with gold, their tables were &s;erved with delicacy and profu&s;ion; the hou&s;es which they built for their own u&s;e, would have covered the farm of an ancient con&s;ul; and the mo&s;t honourable citizens were obliged to di&s;mount from their hor&s;es, and re&s;pectfully to &s;alute an eunuch whom they met on the public highway. The luxury of the palace excited the contempt and indignation of Julian, who u&s;ually &s;lept on the ground, who yielded with reluctance

The functions of a judge, which are &s;ometimes incompatible with tho&s;e of a prince, were exerci&s;ed by Julian, not only as a duty, but as an amu&s;ement; and although he might have tru&s;ted the integrity and di&s;cernment of his Praetorian prefects, he often placed him|&s;elf by their &s;ide on the &s;eat of judgment.

<P>THE character of Apo&s;tate has injured the reputation of Julian; and the enthu&s;ia&s;m which clouded his virtues, has exaggerated the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion of Julian.</NOTE> real and apparent magnitude of his faults. Our partial ignorance may repre&s;ent him as a philo|&s;ophic monarch, who &s;tudied to protect, with an equal hand, the religious factions of the empire; and to allay the theological fever which had in|flamed the minds of the people, from the edicts of Diocletian to the exile of Athana&s;ius. A more accurate view of the character and conduct of Julian, will remove this favourable prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion for a prince who did not e&s;cape the general contagion of the times. We enjoy the &s;ingular advantage of comparing the pictures which have been delineated by his fonde&s;t admirers, and his implacable enemies. The actions of Julian are faithfully related by a judicious and candid hi&s;|torian, the impartial &s;pectator of his life and death. The unanimous evidence of his contem|poraries is confirmed by the public and private declarations of the emperor him&s;elf; and his

various writings expre&s;s the uniform tenor of his religious &s;entiments, which policy would have prompted him to di&s;&s;emble rather than to affect.

The vehement zeal of the Chri&s;tians, who de&s;pi&s;ed the wor&s;hip, and overturned the altars, of tho&s;e fabulous deities, engaged their votary in a &s;tate of irreconcileable ho&s;tility with a very numerous party of his &s;ub|jects; and he was &s;ometimes tempted, by the de&s;ire of victory, or the &s;hame of a repul&s;e, to violate the laws of prudence, and even of ju&s;tice. The triumph of the party, which he de&s;erted and oppo&s;ed, has fixed a &s;tain of infamy on the name of Julian; and the un&s;ucce&s;sful apo&s;tate has been overwhelmed with a torrent of pious invectives, of which the &s;ignal was given by the &s;onorous trumpet <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The orator, with &s;ome eloquence, much enthu&s;ia&s;m, and more vanity, addre&s;&s;es his di&s;cour&s;e to heaven and earth, to men and an|gels, to the living and the dead; and above all, to the great Con|&s;tantius (<GAP DESC="foreign">, an odd Pagan expre&s;&s;ion.)

<P>The cau&s;e of his &s;trange and fatal apo&s;tacy, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His edu|cation and apo&s;tacy.</NOTE> may be derived from the early period of his life, when he was left an orphan in the hands of the murderers of his family.

The mild di&s;po&s;ition of the younger brother was le&s;s repugnant to the precepts of the Go&s;pel; and his active curio&s;ity might have been gratified by a theological &s;y&s;tem, which explains the my&s;terious e&s;&s;ence of the Deity; and opens the boundle&s;s pro&s;pect of invi&s;ible and future worlds.

But in the a&s;&s;iduous pro&s;ecution of the&s;e theological &s;tudies, the emperor of the Romans imbibed the illiberal prejudices and pa&s;&s;ions of a polemic divine. He contracted an irrevocable obligation, to main|tain and propagate his religious opinions; and whil&s;t he &s;ecretly applauded the &s;trength and dexterity with which he wielded the weapons of controver&s;y, he was tempted to di&s;tru&s;t the &s;in|cerity, or to de&s;pi&s;e the under&s;tandings, of his antagoni&s;ts, who could ob&s;tinately re&s;i&s;t the force of rea&s;on and eloquence.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tians, who beheld with horror and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Univer&s;al toleration.</NOTE> indignation the apo&s;tacy of Julian, had much more to fear from his power than from his argu|ments. The pagans, who were con&s;cious of his fervent zeal, expected, perhaps with impa|tience, that the flames of per&s;ecution &s;hould be immediately kindled again&s;t the enemies of the gods; and that the ingenious malice of Julian would invent &s;ome cruel refinements of death and torture, which had been unknown to the rude and inexperienced fury of his predece&s;&s;ors. But the hopes, as well as the fears, of the religious factions were apparently di&s;appointed, by the

prudent humanity of a prince <NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">Libanius (Orat. Parent. c. lviii. p. 283, 284.) has eloquently explained the tolerating principles and conduct of his Imperial friend. In a very remarkable epi&s;tle to the people of Bo&s;tra, Julian him&s;elf (epi&s;t. lii.) profe&s;&s;es his moderation, and betrays his zeal; which is acknowledged by Ammianus, and expo&s;ed by Gregory (Orat. iii. p. 72.).</NOTE>, who was careful of his own fame, of the public peace, and of the rights of mankind. In&s;tructed by hi&s;tory and reflection, Julian was per&s;uaded, that if the di&s;ea&s;es of the body may &s;ometimes be cured by &s;alutary violence, neither &s;teel nor fire can era|dicate the erroneous opinions of the mind. The reluctant victim may be dragged to the foot of the altar; but the heart &s;till abhors and di&s;claims the &s;acrilegious act of the hand. Religious ob|&s;tinacy is hardened and exa&s;perated by oppre&s;&s;ion; and, as &s;oon as the per&s;ecution &s;ub&s;ides, tho&s;e who have yielded, are re&s;tored as penitents, and tho&s;e who have re&s;i&s;ted, are honoured as &s;aints and martyrs. If Julian adopted the un&s;ucce&s;sful cruelty of Diocletian and his colleagues, he was &s;en&s;ible that he &s;hould &s;tain his memory with the name of tyrant, and add new glories to the Ca|tholic church, which had derived &s;trength and encrea&s;e from the &s;everity of the pagan magi|&s;trates. Actuated by the&s;e motives, and appre|hen&s;ive of di&s;turbing the repo&s;e of an un&s;ettled reign, Julian &s;urpri&s;ed the world by an edict, which was not unworthy of a &s;tate&s;man, or a philo&s;opher. He extended to all the inhabit|ants of the Roman world, the benefits of a free and equal toleration; and the only hard&s;hip
<PB N="84" REF="91">
which he inflicted on the Chri&s;tians, was to de|prive them of the power of tormenting their fellow-&s;ubjects, whom they &s;tigmati&s;ed with the odious titles of idolaters and heretics. The Pagans received a gracious permi&s;&s;ion, or rather an expre&s;s order, to open ALL their temples <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">In Greece, the temples of Minerva were opened by his expre&s;s command, before the death of Con&s;tantius (Liban. Orat. Parent. c. 55. p. 280.); and Julian declares him&s;elf a pagan in his public manife&s;to to the Athenians. This unque&s;tionable evidence may correct the ha&s;ty a&s;&s;ertion of Ammianus, who &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e Con|&s;tantinople to be the place where he di&s;covered his attachment to the gods.</NOTE>; and they were at once delivered from the op|pre&s;&s;ive laws, and arbitrary vexations, which they had &s;u&s;tained under the reign of Con&s;tantine, and of his &s;ons. At the &s;ame time, the bi&s;hops and clergy, who had been bani&s;hed by the Arian monarch, were recalled from exile, and re&s;tored to their re&s;pective churches; the Donati&s;ts, the Novatians, the Macedonians, the Eunomians, and tho&s;e who, with a more pro&s;perous fortune, adhered to the doctrine of the council of Nice. Julian, who under&s;tood and derided their theo|logical di&s;putes, invited to the palace the leaders of the ho&s;tile &s;ects, that he might enjoy the agreeable &s;pectacle of their furious encounters. The clamour of controver&s;y &s;ometimes provoked the emperor to exclaim, <Q>Hear me! the Franks have heard me, and the Alemanni;</Q> but he &s;oon di&s;covered that he was now engaged with more ob&s;tinate and implacable enemies; and though he exerted the powers of oratory to per|&s;uade them to live in concord, or at lea&s;t in peace, he was perfectly &s;atisfied, before he di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed

As the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate prevented the emperor from joining every day in the public devotion of his &s;ubjects, he dedicated a dome&s;tic chapel to his tutelar deity the Sun; his gardens were filled with &s;tatues and altars of the gods; and each apartment of the palace di&s;played the appearance of a magnificent temple.

re&s;pective and &s;ea&s;onable honours from the inde|fatigable devotion of Julian. On &s;olemn fe&s;ti|vals, he regularly vi&s;ited the temple of the god or godde&s;s to whom the day was peculiarly con|&s;ecrated, and endeavoured to excite the religion of the magi&s;trates and people by the example of his own zeal. In&s;tead of maintaining the lofty &s;tate of a monarch, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;plendor of his purple, and encompa&s;&s;ed by the golden &s;hields of his guards, Julian &s;olicited, with re|&s;pectful eagerne&s;s, the meane&s;t offices which con|tributed to the wor&s;hip of the gods. Amid&s;t the &s;acred but licentious crowd of prie&s;ts, of inferior mini&s;ters, and of female dancers, who were de|dicated to the &s;ervice of the temple, it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the emperor to bring the wood, to blow the fire, to handle the knife, to &s;laughter the victim, and thru&s;ting his bloody hands into the bowels of the expiring animal, to draw forth the heart or liver, and to read, with the con|&s;ummate &s;kill of an haru&s;pex, the imaginary &s;igns of future events. The wi&s;e&s;t of the pagans cen|&s;ured this extravagant &s;uper&s;tition, which affected to de&s;pi&s;e the re&s;traints of prudence and decency. Under the reign of a prince, who practi&s;ed the rigid maxims of oeconomy, the expence of re|ligious wor&s;hip con&s;umed a very large portion of the revenue; a con&s;tant &s;upply of the &s;carce&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful birds was tran&s;ported from di&s;tant climates, to bleed on the altars of the gods; an hundred oxen were frequently &s;acri|ficed by Julian on one and the &s;ame day; and it &s;oon became a popular je&s;t, that if he &s;hould re|turn

with conque&s;t from the Per&s;ian war, the breed of horned cattle mu&s;t infallibly be extin|gui&s;hed. Yet this expence may appear incon&s;i|derable, when it is compared with the &s;plendid pre&s;ents which were offered, either by the hand, or by order, of the emperor, to all the celebrated places of devotion in the Roman world; and with the &s;ums allotted to repair and decorate the ancient temples, which had &s;uffered the &s;ilent decay of time, or the recent injuries of Chri&s;tian rapine. Encouraged by the example, the ex|hortations, the liberality, of their pious &s;ove|reign, the cities and families re&s;umed the practice of their neglected ceremonies. <Q>Every part of the world, exclaims Libanius, with devout tran&s;port, di&s;played the triumph of religion; and the grateful pro&s;pect of flaming altars, bleeding victims, the &s;moke of incen&s;e, and a &s;olemn train of prie&s;ts and prophets, with|out fear and without danger. The &s;ound of prayer and of mu&s;ic was heard on the tops of the highe&s;t mountains; and the &s;ame ox af|forded a &s;acrifice for the gods, and a &s;upper for their joyous votaries <NOTE N="36" PLACE="foot">The re&s;toration of the Pagan wor&s;hip is de&s;cribed by Julian (Mi&s;opogon, p. 346.), Libanius (Orat.

honoured Athana&s;ius with his &s;incere and peculiar hatred. For his &s;ake alone, he introduced an arbitrary di&s;tinction, repugnant, at lea&s;t to the &s;pirit, of his former declarations.

The pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations of the people &s;oon convinced him, that the majority of the Alexandrians were Chri&s;tians; and that the greate&s;t part of the Chri&s;tians were firmly attached to the cau&s;e of their oppre&s;&s;ed primate. But the knowledge of their &s;entiments, in&s;tead of per&s;uading him to recall his decree, provoked him to extend to all Egypt the term of the exile of Athana&s;ius. The zeal of the multitude ren|dered Julian &s;till more inexorable: he was alarmed by the danger of leaving at the head of a tumultuous city, a daring and popular leader; and the language of his re&s;entment di&s;covers the opinion which he entertained of the courage and abilities of Athana&s;ius.

From thence the emperor pur&s;ued his march, above ninety miles, along the winding &s;tream of the Euphrates, till, at length, about one month after his departure from Antioch, he di&s;covered the towers of Cir|ce&s;ium, the extreme limit of the Roman domi|nions.

Hormi&s;das, at fir&s;t, excited the compa&s;&s;ion, and, at length, acquired the e&s;teem, of his new ma&s;|ters; his valour and fidelity rai&s;ed him to the military honours of the Roman &s;ervice; and, though a Chri&s;tian, he might indulge the &s;ecret &s;atisfaction of convincing his ungrateful country, that an oppre&s;&s;ed &s;ubject may prove the mo&s;t dangerous enemy. Such was the di&s;po&s;ition of the three principal columns. The front and

Dagalaiphus, and Secundinus duke of O&s;rhoene, conducted the troops of the rear-guard; the baggage, &s;ecurely, proceeded in the intervals of the columns; and the ranks, from a motive either of u&s;e or o&s;ten|tation, were formed in &s;uch open order, that the whole line of march extended almo&s;t ten miles. The ordinary po&s;t of Julian was at the head of the centre column; but as he preferred the du|ties of a general to the &s;tate of a monarch, he rapidly moved, with a &s;mall e&s;cort of light ca|valry, to the front, the rear, the flanks, wherever his pre&s;ence could animate or protect the march of the Roman army.

Babylon had been converted into a royal park; but near the ruins of the ancient capital, new cities had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively ari&s;en, and the populou&s;ne&s;s of the country was di&s;played in the multitude of towns and villages, which were built of bricks, dried in the &s;un, and &s;trongly cemented with bitumen; the natural and peculiar production of the Babylonian &s;oil. While the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Cyrus reigned over A&s;ia, the province of A&s;&s;yria alone maintained, during a third part of the year, the luxurious plenty of the table and hou&s;ehold of the Great King. Four con&s;iderable villages were a&s;&s;igned for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of his Indian dogs; eight hundred &s;tallions, and &s;ixteen thou&s;and mares, were con|&s;tantly kept, at the expence of the country, for the royal &s;tables: and as the daily tribute, which was paid to the &s;atrap, amounted to one Engli&s;h bu&s;hel of &s;ilver, we may compute the annual revenue of A&s;&s;yria at more than twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling <NOTE N="56" PLACE="foot">A&s;&s;yria yielded to the Per&s;ian &s;atrap, an <HI>Artaba</HI> of &s;ilver each day.

The trembling A&s;&s;yrians &s;ummoned the rivers to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and completed, with their own hands, the ruin of their country. The roads were ren|dered impracticable; a flood of waters was poured into the camp; and, during &s;everal days, the troops of Julian were obliged to contend with the mo&s;t di&s;couraging hard&s;hips. But every ob&s;tacle was &s;urmounted by the per&s;everance of the legionaries, who were inured to toil as well as to danger, and who felt them&s;elves animated by the &s;pirit of their leader.

the &s;econd rank in the province: a city, large, populous, and well fortified, &s;urrounded with a double wall, almo&s;t encompa&s;&s;ed by a branch of the Euphrates, and defended by the valour of a numerous garri&s;on. The exhortations of Hor|mi&s;das were repul&s;ed with contempt; and the ears of the Per&s;ian prince were wounded by a ju&s;t reproach, that, unmindful of his royal birth, he conducted an army of &s;trangers again&s;t his king and country. The A&s;&s;yrians maintained their loyalty by a &s;kilful, as well as vigorous, defence; till the lucky &s;troke of a battering-ram, having opened a large breach, by &s;hattering one of the angles of the wall, they ha&s;tily retired into the fortifications of the interior citadel. The &s;oldiers of Julian ru&s;hed impetuou&s;ly into the town, and, after the full gratification of every military appetite, Peri&s;abor was reduced to a&s;hes; and the engines which a&s;&s;aulted the citadel were planted on the ruins of the &s;moking hou&s;es. The conte&s;t was continued by an ince&s;&s;ant and mutual di&s;charge of mi&s;&s;ile weapons; and the &s;uperiority which the Romans might derive from the mechanical powers of their bali&s;tae and cata|pultae was counterbalanced by the advantage of the ground on the &s;ide of the be&s;ieged. But as &s;oon as an <HI>Helepolis</HI> had been con&s;tructed, which could engage on equal terms with the loftie&s;t ramparts, the tremendous a&s;pect of a moving turret, that would leave no hope of re&s;i&s;tance or of mercy, terrified the defenders of the citadel into an humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and the place was &s;urrendered only two days after Julian fir&s;t ap|peared

under the walls of Peri&s;abor. Two thou|&s;and five hundred per&s;ons, of both &s;exes, the feeble remnant of a flouri&s;hing people, were per|mitted to retire: the plentiful magazines of corn, of arms, and of &s;plendid furniture, were partly di&s;tributed among the troops, and partly re&s;erved for the public &s;ervice: the u&s;ele&s;s &s;tores were de&s;troyed by fire, or thrown into the &s;tream of the Euphrates; and the fate of Amida was revenged by the total ruin of Peri&s;abor.</P>
<P>The city, or rather fortre&s;s, of Maogamalcha, <NOTE PLACE="marg">of Maoga|malcha.</NOTE> which was defended by &s;ixteen large towers, a deep ditch, and two &s;trong and &s;olid walls of brick and bitumen, appears to have been con|&s;tructed at the di&s;tance of eleven miles, as the &s;afeguard of the capital of Per&s;ia. The emperor, apprehen&s;ive of leaving &s;uch an important fortre&s;s in his rear, immediately formed the &s;iege of Maogamalcha; and the Roman army was di&s;tri|buted, for that purpo&s;e, into three divi&s;ions. Victor, at the head of the cavalry, and of a de|tachment of heavy-armed foot, was ordered to clear the country, as far as the banks of the Ti|gris, and the &s;uburbs of Cte&s;iphon. The con|duct of the attack was a&s;&s;umed by Julian him&s;elf, who &s;eemed to place his whole dependence in the military engines which he erected again&s;t the walls; while he &s;ecretly contrived a more effica|cious method of introducing his troops into the heart of the city. Under the direction of Ne|vitta and Dagalaiphus, the trenches were opened at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and gradually pro|longed as far as the edge of the ditch. The
<PB N="172" REF="179">
ditch was &s;peedily filled with earth; and, by the ince&s;&s;ant labour of the troops, a mine was car|ried under the foundations of the walls, and &s;u&s;|tained, at &s;ufficient intervals, by props of tim|ber. Three cho&s;en cohorts, advancing in a &s;in|gle file, &s;ilently explored the dark and danger|ous pa&s;&s;age; till their intrepid leader whi&s;pered back the intelligence, that he was ready to i&s;&s;ue from his confinement into the &s;treets of the ho&s;tile city. Julian checked their ardour, that he might en&s;ure their &s;ucce&s;s; and immediately diverted the attention of the garri&s;on, by the tumult and clamour of a general a&s;&s;ault. The Per&s;ians, who, from their walls, contemptuou&s;ly beheld the pro|gre&s;s of an impotent attack, celebrated, with &s;ongs of triumph, the glory of Sapor; and ventured to a&s;&s;ure the emperor, that he might a&s;cend the &s;tarry man&s;ion of Ormu&s;d, before he could hope to take the impregnable city of Mao|gamalcha. The city was already taken. Hi&s;tory has recorded the name of a private &s;oldier, the fir&s;t who a&s;cended from the mine into a de&s;erted tower. The pa&s;&s;age was widened by his com|panions, who pre&s;&s;ed forwards with impatient valour. Fifteen hundred enemies were already in the mid&s;t of the city. The a&s;toni&s;hed gar|ri&s;on abandoned the walls, and their only hope of &s;afety; the gates were in&s;tantly bur&s;t open; and the revenge of the &s;oldier, unle&s;s it were &s;u&s;pended by lu&s;t or avarice, was &s;atiated by an undi&s;tingui&s;hing ma&s;&s;acre. The governor, who had yielded on a promi&s;e of mercy, was burnt

alive, a few days afterwards, on a charge of hav|ing uttered &s;ome di&s;re&s;pectful words again&s;t the honour of Prince Hormi&s;das. The fortifications were razed to the ground; and not a ve&s;tige was left, that the city of Maogamalcha had ever exi&s;ted. The neighbourhood of the capital of Per&s;ia was adorned with three &s;tately palaces, laboriou&s;ly enriched with every production that could gratify the luxury and pride of an Ea&s;tern monarch. The plea&s;ant &s;ituation of the gardens along the banks of the Tigris, was improved, according to the Per&s;ian ta&s;te, by the &s;ymmetry of flowers, fountains, and &s;hady walks: and &s;pa|cious parks were inclo&s;ed for the reception of the bears, lions, and wild boars, which were main|tained at a con&s;iderable expence for the plea&s;ure of the royal chace. The park-walls were broke down, the &s;avage game was abandoned to the darts of the &s;oldiers, and the palaces of Sapor were reduced to a&s;hes, by the command of the Roman emperor. Julian, on this occa&s;ion, &s;hewed him|&s;elf ignorant, or carele&s;s, of the laws of civility, which the prudence and refinement of poli&s;hed ages have e&s;tabli&s;hed between ho&s;tile princes.

Coche was &s;ituate on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the Ti|gris; but it was naturally con&s;idered as a &s;uburb of Cte&s;iphon, with which we may &s;uppo&s;e it to have been connected by a permanent bridge of boats. The united parts contributed to form the common epithet of Al Modain, THE CITIES, which the Orientals have be&s;towed on the winter re&s;idence of the Sa&s;&s;anides; and the whole cir|cumference of the Per&s;ian capital was &s;trongly fortified by the waters of the river, by lofty walls, and by impracticable mora&s;&s;es. Near the ruins of Seleucia, the camp of Julian was fixed; and &s;ecured, by a ditch and rampart, again&s;t the &s;al|lies of the numerous and enterpri&s;ing garri&s;on of Coche.

<P>THE death of Julian had left the public affairs of the empire in a very doubtful and dangerous &s;ituation. The Roman army was <NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the church, A.

The indi&s;cretion of his predece&s;&s;or, in&s;tead of reconciling, had artfully fomented the religious war: and the balance which he affected to pre|&s;erve between the ho&s;tile factions, &s;erved only to perpetuate the conte&s;t, by the vici&s;&s;itudes of hope and fear, by the rival claims of ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and actual favour. The Chri&s;tians had forgotten the &s;pirit of the Go&s;pel; and the Pa|gans had imbibed the &s;pirit of the church. In private families, the &s;entiments of nature were

extingui&s;hed by the blind fury of zeal and re|venge: the maje&s;ty of the laws was violated or abu&s;ed; the cities of the Ea&s;t were &s;tained with blood; and the mo&s;t implacable enemies of the Romans were in the bo&s;om of their country. Jovian was educated in the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;|tianity; and as he marched from Ni&s;ibis to An|tioch, the banner of the Cro&s;s, the LABARUM of Con&s;tantine, which was again di&s;played at the head of the legions, announced to the people the faith of their new emperor. As &s;oon as he a&s;|cended the throne, he tran&s;mitted a circular epi&s;tle to all the governors of provinces: in which he confe&s;&s;ed the divine truth, and &s;ecured the legal e&s;tabli&s;hment, of the Chri&s;tian religion. The in&s;idious edicts of Julian were aboli&s;hed; the eccle&s;ia&s;tical immunities were re&s;tored and enlarged; and Jovian conde&s;cended to lament, that the di&s;tre&s;s of the times obliged him to di|mini&s;h the mea&s;ure of charitable di&s;tributions <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Jovian re&s;tored to the church <GAP DESC="foreign">; a forcible and comprehen&s;ive expre&s;&s;ion (Philo&s;torgius, l. viii. c. 5. with Gode|froy's Di&s;&s;ertations, p. 329.

of Cappadocia. The&s;e u&s;eful and innocent occupations were interrupted by the appearance of an officer, with a band of &s;oldiers, who, in the name of his new &s;overeigns, Valentinian and Va|lens, was di&s;patched to conduct the unfortunate Procopius, either to a perpetual pri&s;on, or an ignominious death. His pre&s;ence of mind pro|cured him a longer re&s;pite, and a more &s;plendid fate. Without pre&s;uming to di&s;pute the royal mandate, he reque&s;ted the indulgence of a few moments, to embrace his weeping family; and, while the vigilance of his guards was relaxed by a plentiful entertainment, he dexterou&s;ly e&s;caped to the &s;ea-coa&s;t of the Euxine, from whence he pa&s;&s;ed over to the country of Bo&s;phorus. In that &s;eque&s;tered region he remained many months, expo&s;ed to the hard&s;hips of exile, of &s;olitude, and of want; his melancholy temper brooding over his misfortunes, and his mind agitated by the ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion, that, if any accident &s;hould di&s;cover his name, the faithle&s;s Barbarians would violate, without much &s;cruple, the laws of ho|&s;pitality. In a moment of impatience and de&s;pair, Procopius embarked in a merchant ve&s;&s;el, which made &s;ail for Con&s;tantinople; and boldly a&s;pired to the rank of a &s;overeign, becau&s;e he was not allowed to enjoy the &s;ecurity of a &s;ubject.

tru&s;ted his life and fortune to the fidelity of two friends, a &s;enator and an eunuch, and con|ceived &s;ome hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, from the intel|ligence which he obtained of the actual &s;tate of public affairs. The body of the people was in|fected with a &s;pirit of di&s;content: they regretted the ju&s;tice and the abilities of Sallu&s;t, who had been imprudently di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the praefecture of the Ea&s;t. They de&s;pi&s;ed the character of Valens, which was rude without vigour, and feeble without mildne&s;s. They dreaded the in|fluence of his father-in-law, the Patrician Pe|tronius, a cruel and rapacious mini&s;ter, who ri|gorou&s;ly exacted all the arrears of tribute, that might remain unpaid &s;ince the reign of the em|peror Aurelian. The circum&s;tances were pro|pitious to the de&s;igns of an u&s;urper. The ho&s;tile mea&s;ures of the Per&s;ians required the pre&s;ence of Valens in Syria: from the Danube to the Eu|phrates the troops were in motion; and the capital was occa&s;ionally filled with the &s;oldiers who pa&s;&s;ed, or repa&s;&s;ed, the Thracian Bo&s;phorus. Two cohorts of Gauls were per&s;uaded to li&s;ten to the &s;ecret propo&s;als of the con&s;pirators; which were recommended by the promi&s;e of a liberal donative; and, as they &s;till revered the memory of Julian, they ea&s;ily con&s;ented to &s;upport the hereditary claim of his pro&s;cribed kin&s;man. At the dawn of day they were drawn up near the baths of Ana&s;ta&s;ia; and Procopius, clothed in a purple garment, more &s;uitable to a player than to a monarch, appeared, as if he ro&s;e from the

dead, in the mid&s;t of Con&s;tantinople. The &s;ol|diers, who were prepared for his reception, &s;aluted their trembling prince with &s;houts of joy, and vows of fidelity. Their numbers were &s;oon increa&s;ed by a &s;turdy band of pea&s;ants, collected from the adjacent country; and Procopius, &s;hielded by the arms of his adherents, was &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively conducted to the tribunal, the &s;enate, and the palace. During the fir&s;t moments of his tumultuous reign, he was a&s;toni&s;hed and terrified by the gloomy &s;ilence of the people; who were either ignorant of the cau&s;e, or apprehen&s;ive of the event. But his military &s;trength was &s;uperior to any actual re&s;i&s;tance: the malecontents flocked to the &s;tandard of rebellion; the poor were ex|cited by the hopes, and the rich were intimidated by the fear, of a general pillage; and the ob|&s;tinate credulity of the multitude was once more deceived by the promi&s;ed advantages of a revo|lution. The magi&s;trates were &s;eized; the pri&s;ons and ar&s;enals broke open; the gates, and the entrance of the harbour, were diligently occupied; and, in a few hours, Procopius became the ab|&s;olute, though precarious, ma&s;ter of the Imperial city. The u&s;urper improved this unexpected &s;ucce&s;s with &s;ome degree of courage and dexterity. He artfully propagated the rumours and opinions the mo&s;t favourable to his intere&s;t; while he deluded the populace by giving audience to the frequent, but imaginary, amba&s;&s;adors of di&s;tant nations. The large bodies of troops &s;tationed in the cities of Thrace, and the fortre&s;&s;es of the Lower Danube, were gradually involved in the

After an honourable defence, the city and i&s;land of Cyzicus yielded to his power; the renowned legions of the Jovians and Herculians embraced the cau&s;e of the u&s;urper, whom they were order|ed to cru&s;h; and, as the veterans were continually augmented with new levies, he &s;oon appeared at the head of an army, who&s;e valour, as well as numbers, were not unequal to the greatne&s;s of the conte&s;t.

In a &s;ea&s;on of tranquillity, Sallu&s;t had re&s;igned without a mur|mur; but as &s;oon as the public &s;afety was at|tacked, he ambitiou&s;ly &s;olicited the pre-eminence of toil and danger; and the re&s;toration of that virtuous mini&s;ter to the praefecture of the Ea&s;t, was the fir&s;t &s;tep which indicated the repentance of Valens, and &s;atisfied the minds of the people. The reign of Procopius was apparently &s;upport|ed by powerful armies, and obedient provinces. But many of the principal officers, military as well as civil, had been urged, either by motives of duty or intere&s;t, to withdraw them&s;elves from the guilty &s;cene; or to watch the moment of betraying, and de&s;erting, the cau&s;e of the u&s;urper. Lupicinus advanced by ha&s;ty marches, to bring the legions of Syria to the aid of Valens.

As &s;oon as the Chri&s;tians of the We&s;t had extricated them&s;elves from the &s;nares of the creed of Rimini, they happily relap&s;ed into the &s;lumber of orthodoxy; and the &s;mall remains of the Arian party, that &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at Sirmium or Milan, might be con&s;idered, rather as objects of contempt than of re&s;entment.

The two brothers had pa&s;&s;ed their private life in the condition of catechumens; but the piety of Valens prompted him to &s;olicit the &s;acrament of bapti&s;m, before he expo&s;ed his per&s;on to the dangers of a Gothic war.

After he had taken this deci&s;ive &s;tep, it was extremely difficult for him to pre&s;erve either the virtue, or the reputation, of impartiality.

Dama&s;us, bi&s;hop of Rome, was publicly read in the churches of the city.

The director was no longer permitted to receive any gift, or legacy, or inheritance, from the liberality of his &s;piritual daughter: every te&s;tament contrary to this edict was declared null and void; and the illegal donation was confi&s;|cated for the u&s;e of the trea&s;ury.

Two Roman counts were defeated and mortally wounded; and the &s;tandard of the Heruli and Batavians fell into the hands of the conquerors, who di&s;played, with in&s;ulting &s;houts and menaces, the trophy of their victory. The &s;tandard was recovered; but the Batavians had not redeemed the &s;hame of their di&s;grace and flight in the eyes of their &s;evere judge. It was the opinion of Valentinian, that his &s;oldiers mu&s;t learn to fear their commander, before they could cea&s;e to fear the enemy. The troops were &s;olemnly a&s;&s;embled: and the trem|bling Batavians were inclo&s;ed within the circle of the Imperial army.

The highlanders were condemned to the occupations of &s;hepherds and hunters; and, as they &s;eldom were fixed to any permanent habitation, they acquired the ex|pre&s;&s;ive name of SCOTS, which, in the Celtic tongue, is &s;aid to be equivalent to that of <HI>wan|derers,</HI> or <HI>vagrants.</HI> The inhabitants of a barren land were urged to &s;eek a fre&s;h &s;upply of food in the waters. The deep lakes and bays which in|ter&s;ect their country, are plentifully &s;tored with fi&s;h; and they gradually ventured to ca&s;t their nets in the waves of the ocean. The vicinity of the Hebrides, &s;o profu&s;ely &s;cattered along the

we&s;tern coa&s;t of Scotland, tempted their curio&s;ity, and improved their &s;kill; and they acquired, by &s;low degrees, the art, or rather the habit, of managing their boats in a tempe&s;tuous &s;ea, and of &s;teering their nocturnal cour&s;e by the light of the well-known &s;tars. The two bold headlands of Caledonia almo&s;t touch the &s;hores of a &s;pa|cious i&s;land, which obtained, from its luxuriant vegetation, the epithet of <HI>Green;</HI> and has pre|&s;erved, with a &s;light alteration, the name of Erin, or Ierne, or Ireland. It is <HI>probable,</HI> that in &s;ome remote period of antiquity, the fertile plains of Ul&s;ter received a colony of hungry Scots; and that the &s;trangers of the North, who had dared to encounter the arms of the legions, &s;pread their conque&s;ts over the &s;avage and unwarlike natives of a &s;olitary i&s;land. It is <HI>certain,</HI> that, in the declining age of the Roman empire, Caledonia, Ireland, and the I&s;le of Man, were inhabited by the Scots; and that the kindred tribes, who were often a&s;&s;ociated in military enterprize, were deeply affected by the various accidents of their mutual fortunes. They long cheri&s;hed the lively tradition of their common name and origin: and the mi&s;&s;ionaries of the I&s;le of Saints, who diffu&s;ed the light of Chri&s;tianity over North Bri|tain, e&s;tabli&s;hed the vain opinion, that their Iri&s;h countrymen were the natural, as well as &s;piritual, fathers of the Scotti&s;h race.

and the vines and fruit-trees of that rich territory were extirpated by the malicious &s;avages of Getulia. The unhappy provincials implored the protection of Romanus; but they &s;oon found that their military governor was not le&s;s cruel and rapacious than the Barbarians. As they were incapable of furni&s;hing the four thou&s;and camels, and the exorbitant pre&s;ent, which he required, before he would march to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Tri|poli; his demand was equivalent to a refu&s;al, and he might ju&s;tly be accu&s;ed as the author of the public calamity. In the annual a&s;&s;embly of the three cities, they nominated two deputies, to lay at the feet of Valentinian the cu&s;tomary offering of a gold victory; and to accompany this tribute, of duty, rather than of gratitude, with their humble complaint, that they were ruined by the enemy, and betrayed by their governor. If the &s;everity of Valentinian had been rightly directed, it would have fallen on the guilty head of Romanus. But the Count, long exerci&s;ed in the arts of corruption, had di&s;patched a &s;wift and tru&s;ty me&s;&s;enger to &s;ecure the venal friend&s;hip of Remigius, ma&s;ter of the offices. The wi&s;dom of the Imperial council was deceived by artifice; and their hone&s;t indignation was cooled by delay. At length, when the repetition of complaint had been ju&s;tified by the repetition of public misfor|tunes, the notary Palladius was &s;ent from the court of Treves, to examine the &s;tate of Africa, and the conduct of Romanus. The rigid im|partiality of Palladius was ea&s;ily di&s;armed: he
<PB N="303" REF="310">
was tempted to re&s;erve for him&s;elf a part of the public trea&s;ure, which he brought with him for the payment of the troops; and from the moment that he was con&s;cious of his own guilt, he could no longer refu&s;e to atte&s;t the innocence and merit of the Count. The charge of the Tripolitans was declared to be fal&s;e and frivolous; and Pal|ladius him&s;elf was &s;ent back from Treves to Africa, with a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion, to di&s;cover and pro&s;ecute the authors of this impious con|&s;piracy again&s;t the repre&s;entatives of the &s;overeign. His enquiries were managed with &s;o much dex|terity and &s;ucce&s;s, that he compelled the citizens of Leptis, who had &s;u&s;tained a recent &s;iege of eight days, to contradict the truth of their own decrees, and to cen&s;ure the behaviour of their own deputies. A bloody &s;entence was pronoun|ced, without he&s;itation, by the ra&s;h and head&s;trong cruelty of Valentinian. The pre&s;ident of Tri|poli, who had pre&s;umed to pity the di&s;tre&s;s of the province, was publicly executed at Utica; four di&s;tingui&s;hed citizens were put to death, as the accomplices of the imaginary fraud; and the tongues of two others were cut out, by the ex|pre&s;s order of the emperor.

Before he could procure any cer|tain intelligence, that the emperor of the We&s;t had fixed the choice of a general, or that a fleet of tran&s;ports was collected at the mouth of the Rhone, he was &s;uddenly informed, that the great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Theodo|&s;ius reco|vers Afri|ca, A.

Though Firmus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed arms and trea&s;ures, his de&s;pair of victory immediately reduced him to the u&s;e of tho&s;e arts, which, in the &s;ame country, and in a &s;imilar &s;ituation, had formerly been practi&s;ed by the crafty Jugurtha. He attempted to deceive, by an apparent &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the vigilance of the Roman general; to &s;educe the fidelity of his troops; and to protract the duration of the war, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ively engaging the independent tribes of Africa to e&s;pou&s;e his quarrel, or to protect his flight. Theodo&s;ius imitated the example, and obtained the &s;ucce&s;s, of his predece&s;&s;or Metel|lus. When Firmus, in the character of a &s;up|pliant, accu&s;ed his own ra&s;hne&s;s, and humbly &s;olicited the clemency of the emperor, the lieu|tenant of Valentinian received and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with a friendly embrace; but he diligently re|quired the u&s;eful and &s;ub&s;tantial pledges of a &s;in|cere repentance; nor could he be per&s;uaded, by the a&s;&s;urances of peace, to &s;u&s;pend, for an

in&s;tant, the operations of an active war. A dark con&s;piracy was detected by the penetration of Theodo&s;ius; and he &s;atisfied, without much re|luctance, the public indignation, which he had &s;ecretly excited. Several of the guilty accom|plices of Firmus were abandoned, according to ancient cu&s;tom, to the tumult of a military exe|cution; many more, by the amputation of both their hands, continued to exhibit an in&s;tructive &s;pectacle of horror; the hatred of the rebels was accompanied with fear; and the fear of the Ro|man &s;oldiers was mingled with re&s;pectful admi|ration. Amid&s;t the boundle&s;s plains of Getulia, and the innumerable vallies of Mount Atlas, it was impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the e&s;cape of Firmus: and if the u&s;urper could have tired the patience of his antagoni&s;t, he would have &s;ecured his per|&s;on in the depth of &s;ome remote &s;olitude, and expected the hopes of a future revolution. He was &s;ubdued by the per&s;everance of Theodo&s;ius; who had formed an inflexible determination, that the war &s;hould end only by the death of the tyrant, and that every nation of Africa, which pre&s;umed to &s;upport his cau&s;e, &s;hould be involved in his ruin. At the head of a &s;mall body of troops, which &s;eldom exceeded three thou&s;and five hundred men, the Roman general advanced, with a &s;teady prudence, devoid of ra&s;hne&s;s, or of fear, into the heart of a country, where he was &s;ometimes attacked by armies of twenty thou&s;and Moors. The boldne&s;s of his charge di&s;mayed the irregular Barbarians; they were di&s;concerted

When Theodo&s;ius entered the exten&s;ive dominions of Igmazen, king of the I&s;aflen&s;es, the haughty &s;avage required, in words of defiance, his name, and the object of his ex|pedition. <Q>I am, replied the &s;tern and di&s;dain|ful count, I am the general of Valentinian, the lord of the world; who has &s;ent me hither to pur&s;ue and puni&s;h a de&s;perate robber.

The guards that were placed to &s;ecure the per&s;on of Firmus, deprived him of the hopes of e&s;cape; and the Moori&s;h tyrant, after wine had extingui&s;hed the &s;en&s;e of danger, di&s;appoint|ed the in&s;ulting triumph of the Romans, by &s;trangling him&s;elf in the night. His dead body, the only pre&s;ent which Igmazen could offer to the conqueror, was carele&s;ly thrown upon a camel: and Theodo&s;ius, leading back his vic|torious troops to Siti&s;i, was &s;aluted by the warm|e&s;t acclamations of joy and loyalty <NOTE N="123" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xxix. 5.

He affected to prai&s;e the prudent and moderate conduct of the king of Armenia; and the un&s;u&s;picious Tiranus was per&s;uaded, by the repeated a&s;&s;urances of in&s;idious friend&s;hip, to deliver his per&s;on into the hands of a faithle&s;s and cruel enemy.

The kingdom of Armenia was reduced to the &s;tate of a Per&s;ian province; the admini&s;tration was &s;hared between a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed &s;atrap and a favourite eunuch; and Sa|por marched, without delay, to &s;ubdue the mar|tial &s;pirit of the Iberians.

to re&s;i&s;t the effort of his arms. The trea&s;ure depo&s;ited in that &s;trong fortre&s;s tempted the avarice of Sapor; but the danger of Olympias, the wife, or widow, of the Armenian king, ex|cited the public compa&s;&s;ion, and animated the de&s;perate valour of her &s;ubjects and &s;oldiers. The Per&s;ians were &s;urpri&s;ed and repul&s;ed under the walls of Artogera&s;&s;a, by a bold and well|concerted &s;ally of the be&s;ieged. But the forces of Sapor were continually renewed and increa&s;ed; the hopele&s;s courage of the garri&s;on was exhau&s;t|ed; the &s;trength of the walls yielded to the a&s;&s;ault; and the proud conqueror, after wa&s;ting the rebellious city with fire and &s;word, led away captive an unfortunate queen; who, in a more au&s;picious hour, had been the de&s;tined bride of the &s;on of Con&s;tantine <NOTE N="135" PLACE="foot">Tillemont (Hi&s;t. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 701.) proves, from chronology, that Olympias mu&s;t have been the mother of Para.</NOTE>.

The &s;atraps, whom he was obliged to tru&s;t, embraced the fir&s;t opportunity of regaining the affection of their countrymen, and of &s;ignali&s;ing their immortal hatred to the Per&s;ian name. Since the conver&s;ion of the Armenians and Iberians, tho&s;e nations con&s;idered the Chri&s;tians as the fa|vourites, and the Magians as the adver&s;aries, of the Supreme Being; the influence of the clergy, over a &s;uper&s;titious people, was uniformly exert|ed

in the cau&s;e of Rome; and as long as the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors of Con&s;tantine di&s;puted with tho&s;e of Artaxerxes the &s;overeignty of the intermediate provinces, the religious connexion always threw a deci&s;ive advantage into the &s;cale of the empire. A numerous and active party acknowledged Para, the &s;on of Tiranus, as the lawful &s;overeign of Armenia; and his title to the throne was deeply rooted in the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of five hundred years. By the unanimous con&s;ent of the Iberians, the country was equally divided between the rival princes; and A&s;pacuras, who owed his diadem to the choice of Sapor, was obliged to declare, that his regard for his child|ren, who were detained as ho&s;tages by the tyrant, was the only con&s;ideration, which prevented him from openly renouncing the alliance of Per&s;ia. The emperor Valens, who re&s;pected the obliga|tions of the treaty, and who was apprehen&s;ive of involving the Ea&s;t in a dangerous war, ven|tured, with &s;low and cautious mea&s;ures, to &s;up|port the Roman party in the kingdoms of Iberia and Armenia. Twelve legions e&s;tabli&s;hed the authority of Sauromaces on the banks of the Cyrus. The Euphrates was protected by the valour of Arintheus. A powerful army, under the command of count Trajan, and of Vadomair, king of the Alemanni, fixed their camp on the confines of Armenia.

<P>In the general picture of the affairs of the Ea&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Adven|tures of Para, king of Arme|nia.</NOTE> under the reign of Valens, the adventures of Para form one of the mo&s;t &s;triking and &s;ingular ob|jects. The noble youth, by the per&s;ua&s;ion of his mother Olympias, had e&s;caped through the Per|&s;ian ho&s;t that be&s;ieged Artogera&s;&s;a, and implored the protection of the emperor of the Ea&s;t. By his timid councils, Para was alternately &s;upport|ed, and recalled, and re&s;tored, and betrayed. The hopes of the Armenians were &s;ometimes rai&s;ed by the pre&s;ence of their natural &s;overeign; and the mini&s;ters of Valens were &s;atisfied, that they pre&s;erved the integrity of the public &s;aith, if their va&s;&s;al was not &s;uffered to a&s;&s;ume the diadem and title of King. But they &s;oon repent|ed of their own ra&s;hne&s;s. They were confounded by the reproaches and threats of the Per&s;ian mo|narch. They found rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t the cruel and incon&s;tant temper of Para him&s;elf: who
<PB N="317" REF="324">
&s;acrificed, to the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picions, the lives of his mo&s;t faithful &s;ervants; and held a &s;ecret and di&s;graceful corre&s;pondence with the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of his father, and the enemy of his country. Under the &s;pecious pretence of con&s;ulting with the em|peror on the &s;ubject of their common intere&s;t, Para was per&s;uaded to de&s;cend from the moun|tains of Armenia, where his party was in arms, and to tru&s;t his independence and &s;afety to the di&s;cretion of a perfidious court. The king of Armenia, for &s;uch he appeared in his own eyes and in tho&s;e of his nation, was received with due honours by the governors of the provinces through which he pa&s;&s;ed; but when he arrived at Tar&s;us in Cilicia, his progre&s;s was &s;topped under various pretences; his motions were watch|ed with re&s;pectful vigilance; and he gradually di&s;covered, that he was a pri&s;oner in the hands of the Romans. Para &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his indignation, di&s;&s;embled his fears, and, after &s;ecretly preparing his e&s;cape, mounted on hor&s;eback with three hundred of his faithful followers. The officer &s;tationed at the door of his apartment imme|diately communicated his flight to the con&s;ular of Cilicia, who overtook him in the &s;uburbs, and endeavoured, without &s;ucce&s;s, to di&s;&s;uade him from pro&s;ecuting his ra&s;h and dangerous de&s;ign. A legion was ordered to pur&s;ue the royal fugitive; but the pur&s;uit of infantry could not be very alarming to a body of light cavalry; and upon the fir&s;t cloud of arrows that was di&s;charged into the air, they retreated with precipitation to
<PB N="318" REF="325">
the gates of Tar&s;us. After an ince&s;&s;ant march of two days and two nights, Para and his Arme|nians reached the banks of the Euphrates; but the pa&s;&s;age of the river, which they were obliged to &s;wim, was attended with &s;ome delay and &s;ome lo&s;s. The country was alarmed; and the two roads, which were only &s;eparated by an interval of three miles, had been occupied by a thou&s;and archers on hor&s;eback, under the command of a count and a tribune. Para mu&s;t have yielded to &s;uperior force, if the accidental arrival of a friendly traveller had not revealed the danger, and the means of e&s;cape. A dark and almo&s;t impervious path &s;ecurely conveyed the Armenian troop through the thicket; and Para had left behind him the count and the tribune, while they pa|tiently expected his approach along the public highways. They returned to the Imperial court to excu&s;e their want of diligence or &s;ucce&s;s: and &s;eriou&s;ly alleged, that the king of Armenia, who was a &s;kilful magician, had transformed him&s;elf and his followers, and pa&s;&s;ed before their eyes under a borrowed &s;hape. After his return to his native kingdom, Para &s;till continued to profe&s;s him&s;elf the friend and ally of the Romans; but the Romans had injured him too deeply ever to forgive, and the &s;ecret &s;entence of his death was &s;igned in the council of Valens. The execution of the bloody deed was committed to the &s;ubtle prudence of Count Trajan; and he had the merit of in&s;inuating him&s;elf into the confidence of the credulous prince, that he might find an oppor|tunity
<PB N="319" REF="326">
of &s;tabbing him to the heart. Para was invited to a Roman banquet, which had been prepared with all the pomp and &s;en&s;uality of the Ea&s;t: the hall re&s;ounded with cheerful mu&s;ic, and the company was already heated with wine; when the count retired for an in&s;tant, drew his &s;word, and gave the &s;ignal of the murder. A robu&s;t and de&s;perate Barbarian in&s;tantly ru&s;hed on the king of Armenia; and though he bravely defended his life with the fir&s;t weapon that chance offered to his hand, the table of the Imperial <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

but the events &s;carcely de&s;erve the at|tention of po&s;terity, except as the preliminary &s;teps of the approaching decline and fall of the empire. In&s;tead of leading the nations of Ger|many and Scythia to the banks of the Danube, or even to the gates of Con&s;tantinople, the aged monarch of the Goths re&s;igned to the brave Atha|naric the danger and glory of a defen&s;ive war, again&s;t an enemy, who wielded with a feeble hand the powers of a mighty &s;tate. A bridge of boats was e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the Danube; the pre&s;ence of Valens animated his troops; and his ignorance of the art of war was compen&s;ated by per&s;onal bravery, and a wi&s;e deference to the advice of Victor and Arintheus, his ma&s;ters-gene|ral of the cavalry and infantry. The operations of the campaign were conducted by their &s;kill and experience; but they found it impo&s;&s;ible to drive the Vi&s;igoths from their &s;trong po&s;ts in the mountains: and the deva&s;tation of the plains obliged the Romans them&s;elves to repa&s;s the Danube on the approach of winter. The ince&s;|&s;ant rains, which &s;welled the waters of the river, produced a tacit &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms, and confined the emperor Valens, during the whole cour&s;e of the en&s;uing &s;ummer, to his camp of Marciana|polis. The third year of the war was more &s;a|vourable to the Romans, and more pernicious to the Goths. The interruption of trade deprived
<PB N="326" REF="333">
the Barbarians of the objects of luxury, which they already confounded with the nece&s;&s;aries of life; and the de&s;olation of a very exten&s;ive tract of country threatened them with the horrors of famine. Athanaric was provoked, or compelled, to ri&s;k a battle, which he lo&s;t, in the plains; and the pur&s;uit was rendered more bloody by the cruel precaution of the victorious generals, who had promi&s;ed a large reward for the head of every Goth, that was brought into the Imperial camp. The &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Barbarians appea&s;ed the re&s;entment of Valens and his council; the em|peror li&s;tened with &s;atisfaction to the flattering and eloquent remon&s;trance of the &s;enate of Con|&s;tantinople, which a&s;&s;umed, for the fir&s;t time, a &s;hare in the public deliberations; and the &s;ame generals, Victor and Arintheus, who had &s;uc|ce&s;sfully directed the conduct of the war, were empowered to regulate the conditions of peace. The freedom of trade, which the Goths had hi|therto enjoyed, was re&s;tricted to two cities on the Danube; the ra&s;hne&s;s of their leaders was &s;everely puni&s;hed by the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of their pen&s;ions and &s;ub&s;idies; and the exception, which was &s;tipulated in favour of Athanaric alone, was more advan|tageous than honourable to the Judge of the Vi&s;igoths. Athanaric, who, on this occa&s;ion, appears to have con&s;ulted his private intere&s;t, without expecting the orders of his &s;overeign, &s;upported his own dignity, and that of his tribe, in the per&s;onal interview which was propo&s;ed by the mini&s;ters of Valens. He per&s;i&s;ted in his de|claration, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him, without
<PB N="327" REF="334">
incurring the guilt of perjury, ever to &s;et his foot on the territory of the empire; and it is more than probable, that his regard for the &s;anc|tity of an oath was confirmed by the recent and fatal examples of Roman treachery. The Da|nube, which &s;eparated the dominions of the two independent nations, was cho&s;en for the &s;cene of the conference. The Emperor of the Ea&s;t, and the Judge of the Vi&s;igoths, accompanied by an equal number of armed followers, advanced in their re&s;pective barges to the middle of the &s;tream. After the ratification of the treaty, and the delivery of ho&s;tages, Valens returned in tri|umph to Con&s;tantinople; and the Goths remain|ed in a &s;tate of tranquillity about &s;ix years; till they were violently impelled again&s;t the Roman empire, by an innumerable ho&s;t of Scythians, who appeared to i&s;&s;ue from the frozen regions of the North <NOTE N="149" PLACE="foot">The Gothic war is de&s;cribed by Ammianus (xxvii. 5.), Zo&s;i|mus (l. iv. p. 211&mdash;214.), and Themi&s;tius (Orat. x. p. 129&mdash;141.).

The active policy of Valentinian was continually employed in adding new fortifications to the &s;ecurity of the frontier:
<PB N="328" REF="335">
but the abu&s;e of this policy provoked the ju&s;t re&s;entment of the Barbarians. The Quadi com|plained, that the ground for an intended fortre&s;s had been marked out on their territories; and their complaints were urged with &s;o much rea&s;on and moderation, that Equitius, ma&s;ter-general of Illyricum, con&s;ented to &s;u&s;pend the pro&s;ecu|tion of the work, till he &s;hould be more clearly informed of the will of his &s;overeign. This fair occa&s;ion of injuring a rival, and of advancing the fortune of his &s;on, was eagerly embraced by the inhuman Maximin, the praefect, or rather ty|rant, of Gaul. The pa&s;&s;ions of Valentinian were impatient of controul; and he credulou&s;ly li&s;ten|ed to the a&s;&s;urances of his favourite, that if the government of Valeria, and the direction of the work, were entru&s;ted to the zeal of his &s;on Mar|cellinus, the emperor &s;hould no longer be im|portuned with the audacious remon&s;trances of the Barbarians. The &s;ubjects of Rome, and the natives of Germany, were in&s;ulted by the arro|gance of a young and worthle&s;s mini&s;ter, who con&s;idered his rapid elevation as the proof and reward of his &s;uperior merit. He affected, how|ever, to receive the mode&s;t application of Gabi|nius, king of the Quadi, with &s;ome attention and regard: but this artful civility concealed a dark and bloody de&s;ign, and the credulous prince was per&s;uaded to accept the pre&s;&s;ing invitation of Marcellinus. I am at a lo&s;s how to vary the narrative of &s;imilar crimes; or how to relate, that, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame year, but in remote parts of the empire, the inho&s;pitable table
<PB N="329" REF="336">
of two Imperial generals was &s;tained with the royal blood of two gue&s;ts and allies, inhumanly murdered by their order, and in their pre&s;ence. The fate of Gabinius, and of Para, was the &s;ame: but the cruel death of their &s;overeign was re|&s;ented in a very different manner by the &s;ervile temper of the Armenians, and the free and dar|ing &s;pirit of the Germans. The Quadi were much declined from that formidable power, which, in the time of Marcus Antoninus, had &s;pread terror to the gates of Rome. But they &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed arms and courage; their courage was animated by de&s;pair, and they obtained the u&s;ual reinforcement of the cavalry of their Sar|matian allies. So improvident was the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in Marcellinus, that he cho&s;e the moment when the brave&s;t veterans had been drawn away, to &s;up|pre&s;s the revolt of Firmus; and the whole pro|vince was expo&s;ed, with a very feeble defence, to the rage of the exa&s;perated Barbarians. They invaded Pannonia in the &s;ea&s;on of harve&s;t; un|mercifully de&s;troyed every object of plunder which they could not ea&s;ily tran&s;port; and either di&s;regarded, or demoli&s;hed, the empty fortifica|tions. The prince&s;s Con&s;tantia, the daughter of the emperor Con&s;tantius, and the grand-daughter of the great Con&s;tantine, very narrowly e&s;caped. That royal maid, who had innocently &s;upported the revolt of Procopius, was now the de&s;tined wife of the heir of the We&s;tern empire. She traver&s;ed the peaceful province with a &s;plendid and unarmed train. Her per&s;on was &s;aved from
<PB N="330" REF="337">
danger, and the republic from di&s;grace, by the active zeal of Me&s;&s;ala, governor of the provinces. As &s;oon as he was informed that the village, where &s;he &s;topped only to dine, was almo&s;t en|compa&s;&s;ed by the Barbarians, he ha&s;tily placed her in his own chariot, and drove full &s;peed till he reached the gates of Sirmium, which were at the di&s;tance of &s;ix and twenty miles. Even Sir|mium might not have been &s;ecure, if the Quadi and Sarmatians had diligently advanced during the general con&s;ternation of the magi&s;trates and people. Their delay allowed Probus, the Prae|torian praefect, &s;ufficient time to recover his own &s;pirits, and to revive the courage of the citizens. He &s;kilfully directed their &s;trenuous efforts to repair and &s;trengthen the decayed fortifications; and procured the &s;ea&s;onable and effectual a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a company of archers, to protect the capital of the Illyrian provinces. Di&s;appointed in their attempts again&s;t the walls of Sirmium, the indignant Barbarians turned their arms again&s;t the ma&s;ter-general of the frontier, to whom they unju&s;tly attributed the murder of their king. Equitius could bring into the field no more than two legions; but they contained the veteran &s;trength of the Mae&s;ian and Pannonian bands. The ob&s;tinacy with which they di&s;puted the vain honours of rank and precedency, was the cau&s;e of their de&s;truction; and, while they acted with &s;eparate forces and divided councils, they were &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;laughtered by the active vigour of the Sarmatian hor&s;e. The &s;ucce&s;s of this inva|&s;ion

While the operations of war were &s;u&s;pended by the &s;everity of the weather, the Quadi made an humble attempt to deprecate the wrath of their conqueror; and, at the earne&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion of Equitius, their amba&s;&s;adors were introduced into the Imperial council. They approached the throne with bended bodies, and dejected countenances; and, without daring to complain of the murder of their king, they af|firmed, with &s;olemn oaths, that the late inva&s;ion was the crime of &s;ome irregular robbers, which the public council of the nation condemned and abhorred. The an&s;wer of the emperor left them but little to hope from his clemency or com|pa&s;&s;ion. He reviled, in the mo&s;t intemperate language, their ba&s;ene&s;s, their ingratitude, their in&s;olence.&mdash;His eyes, his voice, his colour, his ge&s;tures, expre&s;&s;ed the violence of his ungovern|ed fury; and, while his whole frame was agitated with convul&s;ive pa&s;&s;ion, a large blood-ve&s;&s;el &s;ud|denly bur&s;t in his body; and Valentinian fell &s;peechle&s;s into the arms of his attendants. Their pious care immediately concealed his &s;ituation from the crowd: but, in a few minutes, the emperor of the We&s;t expired in an agony of pain, <NOTE PLACE="marg">and death, of Valenti|nian,</NOTE> retaining his &s;en&s;es till the la&s;t; and &s;truggling,

He was the elde&s;t &s;on of a monarch, who&s;e glorious reign had confirmed the free and honourable choice of his fellow-&s;oldiers. Before he had attained the ninth year of his age, the royal youth received from the hands of his indulgent father the purple robe and diadem, with the title of Augu&s;tus: the election was &s;olemnly ratified by the con&s;ent and applau&s;e of the armies of Gaul <NOTE N="156" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xxvii. 6.) de&s;cribes the form of this military election, and <HI>augu&s;t</HI> inve&s;titure.

of reigning in the name of an infant, was artfully executed by Mellobaudes and Equitius, who commanded the attachment of the Illyrian and Italian bands. They contrived the mo&s;t honour|able pretences to remove the popular leaders, and the troops of Gaul, who might have a&s;&s;erted the claims of the lawful &s;ucce&s;&s;or: they &s;ugge&s;ted the nece&s;&s;ity of extingui&s;hing the hopes of foreign and dome&s;tic enemies, by a bold and deci&s;ive mea&s;ure. The empre&s;s Ju&s;tina, who had been left in a palace about one hundred miles from Bregetio, was re&s;pectfully invited to appear in the camp, with the &s;on of the decea&s;ed emperor. On the &s;ixth day after the death of Valentinian, the infant prince of the &s;ame name, who was only four years old, was &s;hewn, in the arms of his mother, to the legions; and &s;olemnly inve&s;ted, by military acclamation, with the titles and en|&s;igns of &s;upreme power. The impending dan|gers of a civil war were &s;ea&s;onably prevented by the wi&s;e and moderate conduct of the emperor Gratian.

<P>IN the &s;econd year of the reign of Valentinian and Valens, on the morning of the twenty|fir&s;t day of July, the greate&s;t part of the Roman <NOTE PLACE="marg">Earth|quakes, A.

The impre&s;&s;ion was communicated to the waters; the &s;hores of the Mediterranean were left dry, by the &s;udden retreat of the &s;ea; great quantities of fi&s;h were caught with the hand; large ve&s;&s;els were &s;tranded on the mud; and a curious &s;pectator <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Such is the bad ta&s;te of Ammianus (xxvi. 10.), that it is not ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h his facts from his metaphors.

But the tide &s;oon returned, with the weight of an immen&s;e and irre&s;i&s;tible deluge, which was &s;everely felt on the coa&s;ts of Sicily, of Dalmatia, of Greece, and of Egypt: large boats were tran&s;|ported, and lodged on the roofs of hou&s;es, or

This calamity, the report of which was magnified from one province to another, a&s;toni&s;hed and terrified the &s;ubjects of Rome; and their affrighted imagination enlarged the real extent of a momentary evil. They recol|lected the preceding earthquakes, which had &s;ub|verted the cities of Pale&s;tine and Bithynia: they con&s;idered the&s;e alarming &s;trokes as the prelude only of &s;till more dreadful calamities, and their fearful vanity was di&s;po&s;ed to confound the &s;ymp|toms of a declining empire, and a &s;inking world <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The earthquakes and inundations are variou&s;ly de&s;cribed by Libanius (Orat. de ulci&s;cend&acirc; Juliani nece, c. x. in Fabricius, Bibl.

It was the fa&s;hion of the times, to attribute every remarkable event to the particular will of the Deity; the alterations of nature were con|nected, by an invi&s;ible chain, with the moral and metaphy&s;ical opinions of the human mind; and the mo&s;t &s;agacious divines could di&s;tingui&s;h, according to the colour of their re&s;pective pre|judices, that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of here&s;y tended to produce an earthquake; or that a deluge was

the inevitable con&s;equence of the progre&s;s of &s;in and error. Without pre&s;uming to di&s;cu&s;s the truth or propriety of the&s;e lofty &s;peculations, the hi&s;torian may content him&s;elf with an ob&s;erva|tion, which &s;eems to be ju&s;tified by experience, that man has much more to fear from the pa&s;|&s;ions of his fellow-creatures, than from the con|vul&s;ions of the elements <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Dicaearchus, the Peripatetic, compo&s;ed a formal treati&s;e, to prove this obvious truth; which is not the mo&s;t honourable to the human &s;pecies (Cicero, de Officiis, ii. 5.).</NOTE>. The mi&s;chievous effects of an earthquake, or deluge, a hurricane, or the eruption of a volcano, bear a very incon|&s;iderable proportion to the ordinary calamities of war; as they are now moderated by the prudence or humanity of the princes of Europe, who amu&s;e their own lei&s;ure, and exerci&s;e the courage of their &s;ubjects, in the practice of the military art. But the laws and manners of modern nations protect the &s;afety and freedom of the vanqui&s;hed &s;oldier; and the peaceful citizen had &s;eldom rea|&s;on to complain, that his life, or even his fortune, is expo&s;ed to the rage of war. In the di&s;a&s;trous period of the fall of the Roman empire, which may ju&s;tly be dated from the reign of Valens, the happine&s;s and &s;ecurity of each individual were per&s;onally attacked; and the arts and labours of ages were rudely defaced by the Barbarians of Scythia and Germany.

In every age, the Scythians, and Tartars, have been renowned for their invincible courage, and rapid conque&s;ts.

The good-natured complaints of Plutarch, and the pathetic lamentations of Ovid, &s;educe our rea&s;on, by exciting our &s;en&s;ibility.</NOTE>. Yet if it be true, that the &s;entiment of compa&s;&s;ion is imper|ceptibly weakened by the &s;ight and practice of dome&s;tic cruelty, we may ob&s;erve, that the hor|rid objects which are di&s;gui&s;ed by the arts of European refinement, are exhibited in their naked and mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting &s;implicity, in the tent of a Tartarian &s;hepherd. The ox, or the &s;heep, are &s;laughtered by the &s;ame hand from which they were accu&s;tomed to receive their daily food; and the bleeding limbs are &s;erved, with very little preparation, on the table of their unfeeling mur|derer. In the military profe&s;&s;ion, and e&s;pecially in the conduct of a numerous army, the exclu&s;ive u&s;e of animal food appears to be productive of the mo&s;t &s;olid advantages. Corn is a bulky and peri&s;hable commodity; and the large magazines, which are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence of our troops, mu&s;t be &s;lowly tran&s;ported by the labour of men, or hor&s;es. But the flocks and herds, which accompany the march of the Tartars, afford a &s;ure and encrea&s;ing &s;upply of fle&s;h and milk: in the far greater part of the uncultivated wa&s;te, the vegetation of the gra&s;s is quick and luxuriant; and there are few places
<PB N="345" REF="352">
&s;o extremely barren, that the hardy cattle of the North cannot find &s;ome tolerable pa&s;ture. The &s;upply is multiplied and prolonged, by the un|di&s;tingui&s;hing appetite, and patient ab&s;tinence, of the Tartars. They indifferently feed on the fle&s;h of tho&s;e animals that have been killed for the table, or have died of di&s;ea&s;e. Hor&s;e-fle&s;h, which in every age and country has been pro|&s;cribed by the civili&s;ed nations of Europe and A&s;ia, they devour with peculiar greedine&s;s; and this &s;ingular ta&s;te facilitates the &s;ucce&s;s of their military operations. The active cavalry of Scy|thia is always followed, in their mo&s;t di&s;tant and rapid incur&s;ions, by an adequate number of &s;pare hor&s;es, who may be occa&s;ionally u&s;ed, either to redouble the &s;peed, or to &s;atisfy the hunger, of the Barbarians. Many are the re&s;ources of cou|rage and poverty. When the forage round a camp of Tartars is almo&s;t con&s;umed, they &s;laugh|ter the greate&s;t part of their cattle, and pre&s;erve the fle&s;h, either &s;moked, or dried in the &s;un. On the &s;udden emergency of a ha&s;ty march, they provide them&s;elves with a &s;ufficient quantity of little balls of chee&s;e, or rather of hard curd, which they occa&s;ionally di&s;&s;olve in water; and this un&s;ub&s;tantial diet will &s;upport, for many days, the life, and even the &s;pirits, of the patient warrior. But this extraordinary ab&s;tinence, which the Stoic would approve, and the hermit might envy, is commonly &s;ucceeded by the mo&s;t voracious indulgence of appetite. The wines of a happier climate are the mo&s;t grateful pre&s;ent,

or the mo&s;t valuable commodity, that can be offered to the Tartars; and the only example of their indu&s;try &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in the art of ex|tracting from mare's milk a fermented liquor, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a very &s;trong power of intoxica|tion.

The hou&s;es of the Tartars are no more than &s;mall tents, of an oval form, which afford a cold and

dirty habitation, for the promi&s;cuous youth of both &s;exes. The palaces of the rich con&s;i&s;t of wooden huts, of &s;uch a &s;ize that they may be conveniently fixed on large waggons, and drawn by a team perhaps of twenty or thirty oxen. The flocks and herds, after grazing all day in the adjacent pa&s;tures, retire, on the approach of night, within the protection of the camp. The nece&s;&s;ity of preventing the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous con|fu&s;ion, in &s;uch a perpetual concour&s;e of men and animals, mu&s;t gradually introduce, in the di&s;tri|bution, the order, and the guard, of the encamp|ment, the rudiments of the military art. As &s;oon as the forage of a certain di&s;trict is con&s;umed, the tribe, or rather army, of &s;hepherds, makes a regular march to &s;ome fre&s;h pa&s;tures; and thus acquires, in the ordinary occupations of the pa&s;|toral li&s;e, the practical knowledge of one of the mo&s;t important and difficult operations of war. The choice of &s;tations is regulated by the differ|ence of the &s;ea&s;ons: in the &s;ummer, the Tartars advance towards the North, and pitch their tents on the banks of a river, or, at lea&s;t, in the neighbourhood of a running &s;tream. But in the winter they return to the South, and &s;helter their camp, behind &s;ome convenient eminence, again&s;t the winds, which are chilled in their pa&s;&s;age over the bleak and icy regions of Siberia. The&s;e manners are admirably adapted to diffu&s;e, among the wandering tribes, the &s;pirit of emigration and conque&s;t. The connection between the people and their territory is of &s;o frail a texture, that it
<PB N="348" REF="355">
may be broken by the &s;lighte&s;t accident. The camp, and not the &s;oil, is the native country of the genuine Tartar. Within the precincts of that camp, his family, his companions, his property are always included; and, in the mo&s;t di&s;tant marches, he is &s;till &s;urrounded by the objects which are dear, or valuable, or familiar in his eyes. The thir&s;t of rapine, the fear, or the re|&s;entment of injury, the impatience of &s;ervitude, have, in every age, been &s;ufficient cau&s;es to urge the tribes of Scythia boldly to advance into &s;ome unknown countries, where they might hope to find a more plentiful &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or a le&s;s form|idable enemy. The revolutions of the North have frequently determined the fate of the South; and in the conflict of ho&s;tile nations, the victor and the vanqui&s;hed have alternately drove, and been driven, from the confines of China to tho&s;e of Germany <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">The&s;e Tartar emigrations have been di&s;covered by M. de Guignes (Hi&s;toire des Huns, tom. i. ii.), a &s;kilful and laborious interpreter of the Chine&s;e language; who has thus laid open new and important &s;cenes in the hi&s;tory of mankind.</NOTE>. The&s;e great emigrations, which have been &s;ometimes executed with almo&s;t incre|dible diligence, were rendered more ea&s;y by the peculiar nature of the climate. It is well known, that the cold of Tartary is much more &s;evere than in the mid&s;t of the temperate zone might rea&s;onably be expected: this uncommon rigour is attributed to the height of the plains, which ri&s;e, e&s;pecially towards the Ea&s;t, more than half a mile above the level of the &s;ea; and to the quantity of &s;altpetre, with which the &s;oil is deeply

<P N="3">III. The pa&s;toral life, compared with the la|bours <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exerci&s;es.</NOTE> of agriculture and manufactures, is un|doubtedly a life of idlene&s;s; and as the mo&s;t honourable &s;hepherds of the Tartar race devolve on their captives the dome&s;tic management of the cattle, their own lei&s;ure is &s;eldom di&s;turbed by any &s;ervile and a&s;&s;iduous cares. But this lei&s;ure, in&s;tead of being devoted to the &s;oft enjoyments of love and harmony, is u&s;efully &s;pent in the vio|lent and &s;anguinary exerci&s;e of the chace. The plains of Tartary are filled with a &s;trong and &s;er|viceable breed of hor&s;es, which are ea&s;ily trained for the purpo&s;es of war and hunting. The Scy|thians of every age have been celebrated as bold and &s;kilful riders: and con&s;tant practice had &s;eated them &s;o firmly on hor&s;eback, that they were &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;trangers to perform the ordi|nary duties of civil life, to eat, to drink, and even to &s;leep, without di&s;mounting from their
<PB N="350" REF="357">
&s;teeds. They excel in the dexterous management of the lance; the long Tartar bow is drawn with a nervous arm; and the weighty arrow is direct|ed to its object with unerring aim, and irre&s;i&s;t|ible force. The&s;e arrows are often pointed again&s;t the harmle&s;s animals of the de&s;ert, which increa&s;e and multiply in the ab&s;ence of their mo&s;t formid|able enemy; the hare, the goat, the roebuck, the fallow-deer, the &s;tag, the elk, and the ante|lope. The vigour and patience both of the men and hor&s;es are continually exerci&s;ed by the fa|tigues of the chace; and the plentiful &s;upply of game contributes to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and even luxury, of a Tartar camp. But the exploits of the hunters of Scythia are not confined to the de&s;truction of timid or innoxious bea&s;ts; they boldly encounter the angry wild-boar, when he turns again&s;t his pur&s;uers, excite the &s;luggi&s;h courage of the bear, and provoke the fury of the tyger, as he &s;lumbers in the thicket. Where there is danger there may be glory: and the mode of hunting, which opens the faire&s;t field to the exertions of valour, may ju&s;tly be con|&s;idered as the image, and as the &s;chool, of war. The general hunting-matches, the pride and delight of the Tartar princes, compo&s;e an in|&s;tructive exerci&s;e for their numerous cavalry. A circle is drawn, of many miles in circumfe|rence, to encompa&s;s the game of an exten&s;ive di&s;trict; and the troops that form the circle re|gularly advance towards a common centre; where the captive animals, &s;urrounded on every

&s;ide, are abandoned to the darts of the hunters. In this march, which frequently continues many days, the cavalry are obliged to climb the hills, to &s;wim the rivers, and to wind through the val|lies, without interrupting the pre&s;cribed order of their gradual progre&s;s. They acquire the habit of directing their eye, and their &s;teps, to a remote object; of pre&s;erving their intervals; of &s;u&s;pending, or accelerating, their pace, according to the motions of the troops on their right and left; and of watching and repeating the &s;ignals of their leaders. Their leaders &s;tudy, in this practical &s;chool, the mo&s;t important le&s;&s;on of the military art; the prompt and accurate judgment of ground, of di&s;tance, and of time. To employ again&s;t a human enemy the &s;ame patience and valour, the &s;ame &s;kill and di&s;cipline, is the only alteration which is required in real war; and the amu&s;ements of the chace &s;erve as a prelude to the conque&s;t of an empire <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Petit de la Croix (Vie de Gengi&s;can, l. iii. c. 7.) repre&s;ents the full glory and extent of the Mogul chace.

The cu&s;tom, which &s;till prevails, of adopting the brave&s;t, and mo&s;t faithful, of the captives, may countenance the very probable &s;u&s;picion, that this exten&s;ive con&s;anguinity is, in a great mea&s;ure, legal and fictitious. But the u&s;eful prejudice, which has obtained the &s;anction of time and opinion, produces the effects of truth; the haughty Barbarians yield a cheerful and voluntary obedience to the head of their blood; and their chief, or <HI>mur&s;a,</HI> as the repre|&s;entative of their great father, exerci&s;es the au|thority of a judge, in peace, and of a leader, in war. In the original &s;tate of the pa&s;toral world, each of the <HI>mur&s;as</HI> (if we may continue to u&s;e a modern appellation) acted as the independent chief of a large and &s;eparate family; and the limits of their peculiar territories were gradually fixed, by &s;uperior force, or mutual con&s;ent. But the con&s;tant operation of various and permanent cau&s;es contributed to unite the vagrant Hords into national communities, under the command of a &s;upreme head. The weak were de&s;irous of &s;upport, and the &s;trong were ambitious of domi|nion; the power, which is the re&s;ult of union, oppre&s;&s;ed and collected the divided forces of the

The mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful of the Tartar princes a&s;&s;umed the military command, to which he was entitled by the &s;uperiority, either of merit, or of power.

He was informed, that the North was agitated by a furious tempe&s;t; that the irruption of the Huns, an unknown and mon&s;trous race of &s;avages, had &s;ubverted the power of the Goths; and that the &s;uppliant multitudes of that warlike nation, who&s;e pride was now humbled in the du&s;t, covered a &s;pace of many miles along the banks of the river. With out-&s;tretched arms, and pathetic lament|ations, they loudly deplored their pa&s;t misfor|tunes and their pre&s;ent danger; acknowledged, that their only hope of &s;afety was in the clemency of the Roman government; and mo&s;t &s;olemnly prote&s;ted, that if the gracious liberality of the emperor would permit them to cultivate the wa&s;te lands of Thrace, they &s;hould ever hold them&s;elves bound, by the &s;tronge&s;t obligations of duty and gratitude, to obey the laws, and to guard the limits, of the republic. The&s;e a&s;&s;urances were confirmed by the amba&s;&s;adors of the Goths, who impatiently expected, from the mouth of Valens, an an&s;wer that mu&s;t finally determine the fate of their unhappy countrymen. The emperor of the Ea&s;t was no longer guided by the wi&s;dom and authority of his elder brother, who&s;e death hap|pened <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 375.

and as the di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation of the Goths re|quired an in&s;tant and peremptory deci&s;ion, he was deprived of the favourite re&s;ource of feeble and timid minds; who con&s;ider the u&s;e of dilatory and ambiguous mea&s;ures as the mo&s;t admirable efforts of con&s;ummate prudence. As long as the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts &s;ub&s;i&s;t among man|kind, the que&s;tions of war and peace, of ju&s;tice and policy, which were debated in the councils of antiquity, will frequently pre&s;ent them&s;elves as the &s;ubject of modern deliberation. But the mo&s;t experienced &s;tate&s;man of Europe, has never been &s;ummoned to con&s;ider the propriety, or the danger, of admitting, or rejecting, an innume|rable multitude of Barbarians, who are driven by de&s;pair and hunger to &s;olicit a &s;ettlement on the territories of a civili&s;ed nation. When that im|portant propo&s;ition, &s;o e&s;&s;entially connected with the public &s;afety, was referred to the mini&s;ters of Valens, they were perplexed and divided; but they &s;oon acquie&s;ced in the flattering &s;entiment which &s;eemed the mo&s;t favourable to the pride, the indolence, and the avarice of their &s;overeign. The &s;laves, who were decorated with the titles of praefects and generals, di&s;&s;embled or di&s;regard|ed the terrors of this national emigration; &s;o extremely different from the partial and acci|dental colonies, which had been received on the extreme limits of the empire. But they applaud|ed the liberality of fortune, which had conducted, from the mo&s;t di&s;tant countries of the globe, a numerous and invincible army of &s;trangers, to defend the throne of Valens; who might now add

to the royal trea&s;ures, the immen&s;e &s;ums of gold &s;upplied by the provincials to compen&s;ate their annual proportion of recruits. The prayers of the Goths were granted, and their &s;ervice was accepted by the Imperial court: and orders were immediately di&s;patched to the civil and military governors of the Thracian dioce&s;e, to make the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for the pa&s;&s;age and &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of a great people, till a proper and &s;uf|ficient territory could be allotted for their future re&s;idence. The liberality of the emperor was accompanied, however, with two har&s;h and ri|gorous conditions, which prudence might ju&s;tify on the &s;ide of the Romans; but which di&s;tre&s;s alone could extort from the indignant Goths. Before they pa&s;&s;ed the Danube, they were requir|ed to deliver their arms: and it was in&s;i&s;ted, that their children &s;hould be taken from them, and di&s;per&s;ed through the provinces of A&s;ia; where they might be civili&s;ed by the arts of edu|cation, and &s;erve as ho&s;tages to &s;ecure the fidelity of their parents.</P>

At this im|portant cri&s;is, the military government of Thrace was exerci&s;ed by Lupicinus and Maximus, in who&s;e venal minds the &s;lighte&s;t hope of private emolument outweighed every con&s;ideration of public advantage; and who&s;e guilt was only alle|viated by their incapacity of di&s;cerning the per|nicious effects of their ra&s;h and criminal admini|&s;tration. In&s;tead of obeying the orders of their &s;overeign, and &s;atisfying, with decent liberality, the demands of the Goths, they levied an unge|nerous and oppre&s;&s;ive tax on the wants of the hungry Barbarians. The vile&s;t food was &s;old at an extravagant price; and, in the room of whol|&s;ome and &s;ub&s;tantial provi&s;ions, the markets were filled with the fle&s;h of dogs, and of unclean ani|mals, who had died of di&s;ea&s;e. To obtain the valuable acqui&s;ition of a pound of bread, the Goths re&s;igned the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an expen&s;ive, though &s;erviceable, &s;lave; and a &s;mall quantity of meat was greedily purcha&s;ed with ten pounds of a precious, but u&s;ele&s;s, metal <NOTE N="69" PLACE="foot"><HI>Decem libras;</HI> the word <HI>&s;ilver</HI> mu&s;t be under&s;tood.

The mo&s;t lively re&s;entment is excited by the tyranny of pretended benefactors, who &s;ternly exact the debt of gratitude which they have cancelled by &s;ub|&s;equent injuries: a &s;pirit of di&s;content in&s;en&s;ibly aro&s;e in the camp of the Barbarians, who plead|ed, without &s;ucce&s;s, the merit of their patient and dutiful behaviour; and loudly complained of the inho&s;pitable treatment which they had re|ceived from their new allies. They beheld around them the wealth and plenty of a fertile province, in the mid&s;t of which they &s;uffered the intolerable hard&s;hips of artificial famine. But the means of relief, and even of revenge, were in their hands; &s;ince the rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of their tyrants had left, to an injured people, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and the u&s;e of arms. The clamours of a multitude, un|taught to di&s;gui&s;e their &s;entiments, announced the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of re&s;i&s;tance, and alarmed the timid and guilty minds of Lupicinus and Max|imus.

the cunning of temporary expedients to the wi&s;e and &s;alutary coun&s;els of general policy, attempted to remove the Goths from their dangerous &s;tation on the frontiers of the empire; and to di&s;per&s;e them, in &s;eparate quarters of cantonment, through the interior provinces. As they were con&s;cious how ill they had de&s;erved the re&s;pect, or con|fidence, of the Barbarians, they diligently col|lected, from every &s;ide, a military force, that might urge the tardy and reluctant march of a people, who had not yet renounced the title, or the duties, of Roman &s;ubjects. But the generals of Valens, while their attention was &s;olely direct|ed to the di&s;contented Vi&s;igoths, imprudently di&s;armed the &s;hips and the fortifications, which con&s;tituted the defence of the Danube. The fatal over&s;ight was ob&s;erved, and improved, by Alatheus and Saphrax, who anxiou&s;ly watched the favourable moment of e&s;caping from the pur|&s;uit of the Huns.

He re&s;trained the impa|tient &s;pirit of the Vi&s;igoths, till the injuries and the in&s;ults of their tyrants &s;hould ju&s;tify their re&s;i&s;tance in the opinion of mankind: but he was not di&s;po&s;ed to &s;acrifice any &s;olid advantages for the empty prai&s;e of ju&s;tice and moderation.

On that fatal &s;pot, the flames of di&s;cord and mutual hatred bur&s;t forth into a dreadful conflagration. Lupicinus had invited the Gothic chiefs to a &s;plendid entertainment; and their martial train remained under arms at the entrance of the palace. But the gates of the city were &s;trictly guarded; and the Barbarians were &s;ternly excluded from the u&s;e of a plentiful market, to which they a&s;&s;erted their equal claim of &s;ubjects and allies. Their humble prayers were rejected with in&s;olence and deri&s;ion; and as their pa|tience was now exhau&s;ted, the town&s;men, the &s;ol|diers, and the Goths, were &s;oon involved in a conflict of pa&s;&s;ionate altercation and angry re|proaches.

A blow was imprudently given; a &s;word was ha&s;tily drawn; and the fir&s;t blood that was &s;pilt in this accidental quarrel, became the &s;ignal of a long and de&s;tructive war. In the mid&s;t of noi&s;e and brutal intemperance, Lupi|cinus was informed, by a &s;ecret me&s;&s;enger, that many of his &s;oldiers were &s;lain, and de&s;poiled of their arms; and as he was already inflamed by wine, and oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;leep, he i&s;&s;ued a ra&s;h command, that their death &s;hould be revenged by the ma&s;&s;acre of the guards of Fritigern and Alavivus. The clamorous &s;houts and dying groans appri&s;ed Fritigern of his extreme danger: and, as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the calm and intrepid &s;pirit of a hero, he &s;aw that he was lo&s;t if he allowed a moment of deliberation to the man who had &s;o deeply injured him. <Q>A trifling di&s;pute, &s;aid the Gothic leader, with a firm but gentle tone of voice, appears to have ari&s;en between the two nations; but it may be productive of the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences, unle&s;s the tu|mult is immediately pacified by the a&s;&s;urance of our &s;afety, and the authority of our pre|&s;ence.</Q> At the&s;e words, Fritigern and his companions drew their &s;words, opened their pa&s;|&s;age through the unre&s;i&s;ting crowd, which filled the palace, the &s;treets, and the gates, of Marcia|nopolis, and, mounting their hor&s;es, ha&s;tily vani&s;hed from the eyes of the a&s;toni&s;hed Romans.

The Barbarians expected his approach about nine miles from Marcianopolis; and on this occa&s;ion the talents of the general were found to be of more prevailing efficacy than the weapons and di&s;cipline of the troops. The valour of the Goths was &s;o ably directed by the genius of Fritigern, that they broke, by a clo&s;e and vigorous attack, the ranks of the Roman legions.

The legions of Armenia &s;upported their fame in arms; but they were oppre&s;&s;ed by the irre&s;i&s;tible weight of the ho&s;tile multitude: the left wing of the Romans was thrown into di&s;order, and the field was &s;trewed with their mangled carca&s;&s;es. This partial defeat was balanced, however, by partial &s;ucce&s;s; and when the two armies, at a late hour of the evening, retreated to their re|&s;pective camps, neither of them could claim the honours, or the effects, of a deci&s;ive victory. The real lo&s;s was more &s;everely felt by the Ro|mans, in proportion to the &s;mallne&s;s of their numbers; but the Goths were &s;o deeply con|founded and di&s;mayed by this vigorous, and per|haps unexpected, re&s;i&s;tance, that they remained &s;even days within the circle of their fortifications.

The death of Valens had left the Ea&s;t without a &s;overeign; and Julius, who filled the important &s;tation of ma&s;ter-general of the troops, with a high reputation of diligence and ability, thought it his duty to con&s;ult the &s;enate of Con&s;tantinople; which he con&s;idered, during the vacancy of the throne, as the repre|&s;entative council of the nation. As &s;oon as he had obtained the di&s;cretionary power of acting as he &s;hould judge mo&s;t expedient for the good of the republic, he a&s;&s;embled the principal officers; and privately concerted effectual mea&s;ures for the execution of his bloody de&s;ign.

Whatever re&s;entment the ra&s;h and jealous vanity of his uncle might de&s;erve, the re&s;entment of a gene|rous mind is ea&s;ily &s;ubdued by the &s;ofter emotions of grief and compa&s;&s;ion: and even the &s;en&s;e of pity was &s;oon lo&s;t in the &s;erious and alarming con&s;ideration of the &s;tate of the republic. Gratian was too late to a&s;&s;i&s;t, he was too weak to revenge, his unfortunate colleague; and the valiant and mode&s;t youth felt him&s;elf unequal to the &s;upport of a &s;inking world. A formidable tempe&s;t of the Barbarians of Germany &s;eemed ready to bur&s;t
<PB N="421" REF="428">
over the provinces of Gaul; and the mind of Gratian was oppre&s;&s;ed, and di&s;tracted, by the ad|mini&s;tration of the We&s;tern Empire. In this important cri&s;is, the government of the Ea&s;t, and the conduct of the Gothic war, required the undivided attention of a hero and a &s;tate&s;man. A &s;ubject inve&s;ted with &s;uch ample command would not long have pre&s;erved his fidelity to a di&s;tant benefactor; and the Imperial council embraced the wi&s;e and manly re&s;olution, of con|ferring an obligation, rather than of yielding to an in&s;ult. It was the wi&s;h of Gratian to be&s;tow the purple as the reward of virtue; but, at the age of nineteen, it is not ea&s;y for a prince, edu|cated in the &s;upreme rank, to under&s;tand the true characters of his mini&s;ters and generals. He attempted to weigh, with an impartial hand, their various merits and defects; and, whil&s;t he checked the ra&s;h confidence of ambition, he di&s;|tru&s;ted the cautious wi&s;dom, which de&s;paired of the republic. As each moment of delay dimi|ni&s;hed &s;omething of the power and re&s;ources of the future &s;overeign of the Ea&s;t, the &s;ituation of the times would not allow a tedious debate. The choice of Gratian was &s;oon declared in favour of an exile, who&s;e father, only three years before, had &s;uffered, under the &s;anction of <HI>his</HI> authority, an unju&s;t and ignominious death.

of the reign of Theodo&s;ius, we are reduced to illu&s;trate the partial narrative of Zo&s;imus, by the ob&s;cure hints of fragments and chronicles, by the figurative &s;tyle of poetry or panegyric, and by the precarious a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical wri|ters, who, in the heat of religious faction, are apt to de&s;pi&s;e the profane virtues of &s;incerity and moderation. Con&s;cious of the&s;e di&s;advantages, which will continue to involve a con&s;iderable portion of the decline and fall of the Roman empire, I &s;hall proceed with doubtful and timo|rous &s;teps. Yet I may boldly pronounce, that the battle of Hadrianople was never revenged by any &s;ignal or deci&s;ive victory of Theodo&s;ius over the Barbarians; and the expre&s;&s;ive &s;ilence of his venal orators may be confirmed by the ob&s;erva|tion of the condition and circum&s;tances of the times. The fabric of a mighty &s;tate, which has been reared by the labours of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages, could not be overturned by the misfortune of a &s;ingle day, if the fatal power of the imagination did not exaggerate the real mea&s;ure of the cala|mity. The lo&s;s of forty thou&s;and Romans, who fell in the plains of Hadrianople, might have been &s;oon recruited in the populous provinces of the Ea&s;t, which contained &s;o many millions of inhabitants.

If the Barbarians were mounted on the hor&s;es,

and equipped with the armour, of their vanqui&s;h|ed enemies, the numerous &s;tuds of Cappadocia and Spain would have &s;upplied new &s;quadrons of cavalry; the thirty-four ar&s;enals of the empire were plentifully &s;tored with magazines of offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive arms; and the wealth of A&s;ia might &s;till have yielded an ample fund for the expences of the war. But the effects which were produced by the battle of Hadrianople on the minds of the Barbarians, and of the Romans, extended the victory of the former, and the defeat of the lat|ter, far beyond the limits of a &s;ingle day. A Gothic chief was heard to declare, with in&s;olent moderation, that, for his own part, he was fa|tigued with &s;laughter; but that he was a&s;toni&s;hed how a people, who fled before him like a flock of &s;heep, could &s;till pre&s;ume to di&s;pute the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their trea&s;ures and provinces <NOTE N="115" PLACE="foot">Chry&s;o&s;tom, tom. i. p. 344. edit.

The fortifications and garri&s;ons of the cities were &s;trengthened; and the troops, among whom a &s;en&s;e of order and di&s;cipline was revived, were in&s;en&s;ibly emboldened by the con|fidence of their own &s;afety.

A numerous colony of the Vi&s;igoths was &s;eated in Thrace: the remains of the O&s;trogoths were planted in Phrygia and Lydia; their immediate wants were &s;upplied by a di&s;tribution of corn and cattle; and their future indu&s;try was encouraged by an exemption from tribute, during a certain term of years. The Barbarians would have de|&s;erved to feel the cruel and perfidious policy of the Imperial court, if they had &s;uffered them|&s;elves to be di&s;per&s;ed through the provinces. They required, and they obtained, the &s;ole po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the villages and di&s;tricts a&s;&s;igned for their re&s;idence; they &s;till cheri&s;hed and propa|gated their native manners and language; a&s;&s;ert|ed, in the bo&s;om of de&s;poti&s;m, the freedom of

their dome&s;tic government; and acknowledged the &s;overeignty of the emperor, without &s;ub|mitting to the inferior juri&s;diction of the laws and magi&s;trates of Rome. The hereditary chiefs of the tribes and families were &s;till permitted to command their followers in peace and war; but the royal dignity was aboli&s;hed; and the generals of the Goths were appointed and removed at the plea&s;ure of the emperor. An army of forty thou|&s;and Goths was maintained for the perpetual &s;er|vice of the empire of the Ea&s;t; and tho&s;e haughty troops, who a&s;&s;umed the title of <HI>Foederati,</HI> or allies, were di&s;tingui&s;hed by their gold collars, liberal pay, and licentious privileges. Their native courage was improved by the u&s;e of arms, and the knowledge of di&s;cipline; and, while the republic was guarded, or threatened, by the doubtful &s;word of the Barbarians, the la&s;t &s;parks of the military flame were finally extingui&s;hed in the minds of the Romans <NOTE N="129" PLACE="foot">Compare Jornandes (c. xx. 27.), who marks the condition and number of the Gothic <HI>Foederati,</HI> with Zo&s;imus (l. iv. p. 258.), who mentions their golden collars; and Pacatus (in Panegyr. Vet. xii. 37.), who applauds, with fal&s;e or fooli&s;h joy, their bravery and di&s;|cipline.</NOTE>. Theodo&s;ius had the addre&s;s to per&s;uade his allies, that the con|ditions of peace which had been extorted from him by prudence and nece&s;&s;ity, were the volun|tary expre&s;&s;ions of his &s;incere friend&s;hip for the Gothic nation <NOTE N="130" PLACE="foot">Amator pacis generi&s;que Gothorum, is the prai&s;e be&s;towed by the Gothic hi&s;torian (c. xxix.), who repre&s;ents his nation as inno|cent, peaceable men, &s;low to anger, and patient of injuries.

Petav.). The philo&s;ophic bi&s;hop of Cyrene was near enough to judge; and he was &s;ufficiently removed from the temptation of fear, or flattery.</NOTE>. The calamities of the war were painted in the mo&s;t lively colours; and the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of the return of order, of plenty, and &s;ecurity, were diligently exaggerated. The advocates of Theodo&s;ius could affirm, with &s;ome appearance of truth and rea&s;on, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to extirpate &s;o many warlike tribes, who were rendered de&s;perate by the lo&s;s of their native country; and that the exhau&s;ted provinces would be revived by a fre&s;h &s;upply of &s;oldiers and hu&s;bandmen. The Barbarians &s;till wore an angry and ho&s;tile a&s;pect; but the experience of pa&s;t times might encourage the hope, that they would acquire the habits of indu&s;try and obe|dience; that their manners would be poli&s;hed by time, education, and the influence of Chri&s;tianity; and that their po&s;terity would in&s;en&s;ibly blend with the great body of the Roman people <NOTE N="132" PLACE="foot">Themi&s;tius (Orat. xvi. p. 211, 212.) compo&s;es an elaborate and rational apology, which is not, however, exempt from the pue|rilities of Greek rhetoric.

Their rude and in&s;olent behaviour expre&s;&s;ed their contempt of the citizens and provincials, whom they in|&s;ulted with impunity <NOTE N="133" PLACE="foot">Con&s;tantinople was deprived, half a day, of the public allow|ance of bread, to expiate the murder of a Gothic &s;oldier: <GAP DESC="foreign"> was the guilt of the people.

To the zeal and valour of the Barbarians, Theodo&s;ius was indebted for the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms: but their a&s;&s;i&s;tance was precarious; and they were &s;ometimes &s;educed, by a treacherous and incon&s;tant di&s;po&s;ition, to aban|don his &s;tandard, at the moment when their &s;er|vice was the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential. During the civil war again&s;t Maximus, a great number of Gothic de&s;erters retired into the mora&s;&s;es of Macedonia, wa&s;ted the adjacent provinces, and obliged the intrepid monarch to expo&s;e his per&s;on, and exert his power, to &s;uppre&s;s the ri&s;ing flame of rebel|lion <NOTE N="134" PLACE="foot">Zo&s;imus, l. iv. p. 267&mdash;271.

The public apprehen&s;ions were fortified by the &s;trong &s;u&s;picion, that the&s;e tumults were not the effect of accidental pa&s;&s;ion, but the re&s;ult of deep and premeditated de&s;ign. It was ge|nerally believed, that the Goths had &s;igned the treaty of peace with an ho&s;tile and in&s;idious &s;pirit; and that their chiefs had previou&s;ly bound them|&s;elves, by a &s;olemn and &s;ecret oath, never to keep faith with the Romans; to maintain the faire&s;t &s;hew of loyalty and friend&s;hip, and to watch the favourable moment of rapine, of conque&s;t,

and of revenge. But, as the minds of the Bar|barians were not in&s;en&s;ible to the power of gra|titude, &s;everal of the Gothic leaders &s;incerely devoted them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of the empire, or, at lea&s;t, of the emperor: the whole nation was in&s;en&s;ibly divided into two oppo&s;ite factions, and much &s;ophi&s;try was employed in conver&s;ation and di&s;pute, to compare the obligations of their fir&s;t, and &s;econd, engagements. The Goths, who con&s;idered them&s;elves as the friends of peace, of ju&s;tice, and of Rome, were directed by the authority of Fravitta, a valiant and honourable youth, di&s;tingui&s;hed above the re&s;t of his coun|trymen, by the politene&s;s of his manners, the liberality of his &s;entiments, and the mild virtues of &s;ocial life. But the more numerous faction adhered to the fierce and faithle&s;s Priulf, who inflamed the pa&s;&s;ions, and a&s;&s;erted the independ|ence, of his warlike followers. On one of the &s;olemn fe&s;tivals, when the chiefs of both parties were invited to the Imperial table, they were in|&s;en&s;ibly heated by wine, till they forgot the u&s;ual re&s;traints of di&s;cretion and re&s;pect; and betrayed, in the pre&s;ence of Theodo&s;ius, the fatal &s;ecret of their dome&s;tic di&s;putes. The emperor, who had been the reluctant witne&s;s of this extra|ordinary controver&s;y, di&s;&s;embled his fears and re&s;entment, and &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the tumultuous a&s;&s;embly. Fravitta, alarmed and exa&s;perated by the in&s;olence of his rival, who&s;e departure from the palace might have been the &s;ignal of a civil war, boldly followed him; and, drawing his

&s;word, laid Priulf dead at his feet. Their com|panions flew to arms; and the faithful champion of Rome would have been oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;uperior numbers, if he had not been protected by the &s;ea&s;onable interpo&s;ition of the Imperial guards <NOTE N="135" PLACE="foot">Compare Eunapius (in Excerpt.

Such were the &s;cenes of Barbaric rage, which di&s;graced the palace and table of the Roman emperor; and, as the impatient Goths could only be re&s;trained by the firm and temperate character of Theodo&s;ius, the public &s;afety &s;eem|ed to depend on the life and abilities of a &s;ingle man <NOTE N="136" PLACE="foot">Les Goths ravagerent tout depuis le Danube ju&s;qu'au Bo&s;|phore; exterminerent Valens et &s;on arm&eacute;e; et ne repa&s;&s;erent le Da|nube, que pour abandonner l'affreu&s;e &s;olitude qu'ils avoient faite (Oeuvres de Monte&s;quieu, tom. iii. p. 479; Con&s;iderations &s;ur les <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> de la Grandeur et de la Decadence des Romains, c. xvii.).
