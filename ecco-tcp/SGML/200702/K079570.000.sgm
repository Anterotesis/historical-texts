<L><HI>HEALTH</HI> to great GLOSTER&mdash;from a man unknown,</L>
<L>Who holds thy health as dearly as his own,</L>
<L>Accept this greeting&mdash;nor let mode&s;t fear</L>
<L>Call up one maiden blu&s;h&mdash;I mean not here</L>
<L>To wound with flatt'ry&mdash;'tis a Villain's art,</L>
<L>And &s;uits not with the frankne&s;s of my heart.</L>
<L>Truth be&s;t becomes an <HI>Orthodox</HI> Divine,</L>
<L>And, &s;pite of hell, that Character is mine;</L>
<L>To &s;peak e'en bitter truths I cannot fear;</L>

<L>I a&s;k no favour, not one note I crave,</L>
<L>And, when this bu&s;y brain re&s;ts in the grave,</L>
<L>(For till that time it never can have re&s;t)</L>
<L>I will not trouble you with one beque&s;t.</L>
<L>Some humbler Friend, my mortal journey done,</L>

<L>Sleep at my bidding crept from pew to pew,</L>

Much did I wi&s;h, tho' little could I hope,</L>

<L>Where they are ju&s;tly prais'd, and where thro' whim,</L>

<L>Should He (forbid it Heav'n) &s;o high in place,</L>
<L>So rich in knowledge, quit the work of Grace,</L>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JAMES V. 16th.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FOR the particular occa&s;ion on which the&s;e words were &s;poken, and the re|lation they bear to what preceded, I &s;hall refer you to the chapter from whence they are taken, and at pre&s;ent con&s;ider them as they &s;tand independently, and a&s;&s;ure us, that the duty of prayer, when practi&s;ed by a righteous man, and offered up in a proper manner, is of great efficacy to avert mi&s;|fortunes,
<PB N="2" REF="15">
and procure ble&s;&s;ings; premi&s;ing only, that, by a righteous man we are not to under&s;tand one who is perfectly pure, and free from &s;in, but one who performs his duty to the utmo&s;t of his power, and makes up for any infirmity in his Obe|dience, by the &s;trength of his Faith, and the &s;incerity of his Repentance.</P>
<P>The duty of prayer is in the pre&s;ent age by many entirely neglected, or imperfectly ob&s;erved, and by &s;ome openly decried. There are many who di&s;allow any other ap|plication to God than that of the mind, and not a few who, however con&s;tant in the outward forms of prayer, do yet by their lives but too plainly &s;hew that their minds are unaffected. Some too there are, who run into the contrary extreme, who are &s;o unwarrantably attentive to the performance of this duty, as to neglect obligations which are of much greater import, which are more immediately nece&s;&s;ary for their own good, and the benefit of &s;ociety, and which of con&s;equence mu&s;t be more agreeable to
<PB N="3" REF="16">
the will, and conducive to the glory, of God.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t mi&s;takes like the&s;e prevail, a con|&s;ideration of the duty of prayer cannot be out of &s;ea&s;on; it cannot prejudice tho&s;e who be&s;t under&s;tand it, and may be &s;er|viceable to tho&s;e who do not.</P>
<P>Prayer is a &s;olemn act of wor&s;hipping the Supreme Being; wherein we, on the one hand, acknowledge our weakne&s;s and indigence, on the other his power and ability to afford us relief; it naturally im|plies &s;ome defect in him who offers it up, and &s;ome authority in him to whom it is offered to pardon and amend it; it &s;up|po&s;es God to be the Maker and Governor of all things, and &s;o gracious and con|de&s;cending, &s;o potent and ab&s;olute in his nature, as always to be ready to hear, and able to redre&s;s the Grievances of his Crea|tures, &s;o that this duty is founded on the infinite goodne&s;s and power of God; he is infinitely good, and therefore willing, infi|nitely
<PB N="4" REF="17">
powerful, and therefore able to re|lieve us; and for the&s;e rea&s;ons he is, and he alone can be, the proper object of our Prayers.</P>
<P>The Heathens them&s;elves, as they were fully per&s;uaded of the&s;e perfections in God, and of the great need in which they &s;tood of having them exerted in their behalf, were al&s;o convinced that it was their duty to pray to him; and this duty was heartily acknowledged, earne&s;tly recommended, and &s;trictly practi&s;ed by the wi&s;e&s;t and &s;obere&s;t among them. The Scriptures, as they every where abound with earne&s;t and pa|thetick exhortations to the religious per|formance hereof, &s;o they afford us many &s;trong motives which the Heathens could not have; they &s;upply us with the names of many great and good men who were ex|emplary in the performance of it, among&s;t whom, as in all other works of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;hines with di&s;tin|gui&s;hed lu&s;tre; they fully in&s;truct us both as to the Object to, and the manner in
<PB N="5" REF="18">
which they ought to be offered; they apply them&s;elves to our fears by the mo&s;t &s;evere threats, to our hopes by the mo&s;t delightful promi&s;es, &s;upplying us with an encourage|ment to, and laying a foundation for the performance of this duty, which the Heath|ens could not have, in the veracity of God him&s;elf; who hath &s;aid and cannot lie; who hath declared and cannot deny him|&s;elf, that they who a&s;k &s;hall receive.</P>
<P>The rea&s;onablene&s;s of this duty in gene|ral appears from the &s;lighte&s;t attention to the particular branches of which it con&s;i&s;ts. If we con&s;ider Man merely as a Creature, as ju&s;t come out of the hands of his Maker, as rai&s;ed into being from the du&s;t of the earth, and, be&s;ides many other, endued with tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing privileges, Rea|&s;on and Immortality, &s;ure nothing can be more rea&s;onable than for him to pay his mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and reverential homage to that Being who employs Omnipotence in conferring Benefits upon him; to exert his rea&s;on in the prai&s;e of him who gave it,
<PB N="6" REF="19">
and endeavour to recommend him&s;elf to his infinite goodne&s;s, le&s;t he fall under the ter|rors of his Almighty Power. The ideas of Power are in them&s;elves great and terrible; it naturally in&s;pires us with awe and reve|rence, even when it is lodged in human hands, whence it is liable to be &s;natched by innumerable accidents, and where it hangs but on the &s;lender thread of life. What mu&s;t it do then, when we con&s;ider it infinite and unbounded, placed in the hands of a Being, who is &s;ubject to no acci|dents; who&s;e exi&s;tence is not bounded by any time, but extends it&s;elf unlimited, un|impaired through all ages? What Re&s;pect, what Homage, what Adoration can be too great, when paid to &s;uch a Being? Where can we find an office more agreeable to our Rea&s;on, where a better employment for our Immortality.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider Man as a Creature im|mer&s;t in &s;in, corrupt in his very nature, and prone to all evil, continually tempted by the Devil and the World from without,
<PB N="7" REF="20">
and betrayed by his own violent and head|&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions from within, upon &s;uch a di&s;mal review, &s;ure nothing can be more rea&s;onable, than to have recour&s;e to his Almighty Father, to acknowledge his ori|ginal weakne&s;s and infirmities, his actual &s;ins and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, to expre&s;s his aver|&s;ion to, and re&s;olution again&s;t them, unto him who is the perfection of Purity and Holine&s;s; to beg Pardon and Forgivene&s;s of him who delighteth in mercy, and de&s;ireth not the death of a Sinner; and to pray for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Grace from him, who giveth to them which a&s;k, who hath pro|mi&s;ed to &s;end us the comfort of his holy &s;pirit, who delighteth to dwell in the heart of the &s;incere and contrite.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider Man as &s;ubject to all kinds of mi&s;ery, &s;urrounded with difficulties and troubles which he can neither prevent nor remedy, with dangers which he can neither guard again&s;t nor repel, and with wants which he can neither fore&s;ee nor relieve, we &s;hall &s;urely &s;ee abundant rea&s;on for him
<PB N="8" REF="21">
to apply to God, to lay him&s;elf open, to make his di&s;tre&s;&s;es known, and pray to God that he will deliver him out of all his troubles, defend him in all his dangers, and relieve him in all his wants. When men are under any pre&s;&s;ure or calamity, they natu|rally apply to &s;uch of their fellow creatures as they think are inclined by the goodne&s;s of their di&s;po&s;ition, and enabled by their power or wealth to be of &s;ervice to them: if this is rea&s;onable and prudent, it is cer|tainly much more &s;o to make our addre&s;&s;es to God, who&s;e goodne&s;s as much &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es human goodne&s;s, as his power is be|yond human power, who hath &s;uch an ab|&s;olute command over trouble, &s;ickne&s;s, and any other adver&s;ity, that he &s;aith unto them Go, and they go; who is of &s;uch perfect Goodne&s;s, that he &s;u&s;taineth the Brutes, and feedeth the young Ravens which call upon him, that he openeth his hand, and filleth all things living with plenteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>To turn our eyes from the&s;e melancholy &s;cenes of &s;in and mi&s;ery, if we reflect
<PB N="9" REF="22">
upon the &s;ituation of Man, how impo&s;&s;ible it was for him to avoid &s;inning, and how impo&s;&s;ible to avoid the puni&s;hment due to it; if we con&s;ider him delivered from that terrible dilemma, and if not &s;ecured from &s;inning, directed, which is almo&s;t equiva|lent, how to e&s;cape the con&s;equences of it; if we con&s;ider God the Father as ordain|ing the means of our Redemption, God the Son as performing them, and God the Holy Gho&s;t as re&s;iding in, and &s;anctifying us, how can we ab&s;tain from breaking out in the lively eloquence of the P&s;almi&s;t, Prai&s;e the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me prai&s;e his holy name, Prai&s;e the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all his benefits. Such an unexpected, &s;uch an unde&s;erved change in our affairs, &s;o great a deliverance, &s;uch a mighty &s;alvation as it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily excite our joy, &s;o &s;hould it quicken our gratitude, and incline us to re|turn thee thanks, O God, as for our Crea|tion, Pre&s;ervation, and all the Ble&s;&s;ings of this life, &s;o above all, for thine ine&s;timable love in the redemption of the world by
<PB N="10" REF="23">
our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the means of Grace, and for the hope of Glory.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider, that the whole race of men are mutually related to each other, that their concerns are too clo&s;ely con|nected to bear a &s;eparation, that they came out of the hands of the &s;ame Creator, are &s;u&s;tained by the Providence of the &s;ame Pre&s;erver, and purcha&s;ed by the blood of the &s;ame Redeemer, we cannot but ac|knowledge the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Duty which the Scriptures lay upon every man, of praying for his neighbour as well as for him&s;elf; of offering up his petitions to Almighty God, and interceding for them, that he will turn from them whatever may do them harm, and be plea&s;ed to give unto them what he &s;ees needful either for their bodies, or their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>On the whole, if it is rea&s;onable that the Creature &s;hould acknowledge his de|pendance on the Creator, that tho&s;e who have done ami&s;s &s;hould confe&s;s it, and a&s;k
<PB N="11" REF="24">
forgivene&s;s, that tho&s;e who &s;tand in need of many good, and in fear of many evil things, &s;hould petition for the obtaining of the one, and preventing of the other, if it is rea&s;onable to return thanks for benefits received, and evils prevented, to love our brethren, and to pay regard to the con|cerns of tho&s;e per&s;ons with whom our own are connected, then it is in all the&s;e &s;eve|ral re&s;pects highly rea&s;onable, that we &s;hould di&s;charge the duty of Prayer to Al|mighty God.</P>
<P>This is &s;o evident, that we &s;hould &s;carce believe, did we not daily &s;ee it, that a ra|tional creature could live in the gro&s;s neg|lect and open contempt of a duty, which, merely as a rational creature, he cannot but know that he ought to perform; which is not more &s;trongly recommended by Scrip|ture, than by Rea&s;on it&s;elf, the darling idol of the modern world; and the contempt of which mu&s;t not only rank him among&s;t the irreligious, but which he may perhaps think wor&s;e, among&s;t the unrea&s;onable part
<PB N="12" REF="25">
of the creation. Notwith&s;tanding this, there are men in the world, and tho&s;e mighty Pretenders to Rea&s;on, who openly decry this duty, at lea&s;t all the external parts of it, well knowing that without them the duty it&s;elf cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and artfully found their objections again&s;t it, upon an acknowledgement of, and a &s;eeming veneration for, the divine attri|butes, and the honour of God's nature.</P>
<P>If, &s;ay they, God is of infinite knowledge, as tho&s;e who pray to him mu&s;t certainly allow, what occa&s;ion is there for us to confe&s;s our &s;ins, and expre&s;s our &s;orrow for them, to lay open our wants and nece&s;|&s;ities to him, who by the nece&s;&s;ary perfec|tion of his nature &s;ees into our hearts, and di&s;cerns every motion there much plainer than we can po&s;&s;ibly expre&s;s them.</P>
<P>Such objectors will do well to con&s;ider, that our Prayers are not intended to give any information to God, which he before had not, but to implant deeply in our own
<PB N="13" REF="26">
brea&s;ts a proper &s;en&s;e of what we have done, and a due e&s;timation of what we want; &s;o that the pardon of our &s;ins, and &s;upply of our nece&s;&s;ities may have their due weight with us. Our thoughts come upon us &s;o &s;ud|denly, and &s;o quickly pa&s;s away, that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible accurately to remember the thoughts even of a few hours; but when we give them birth, and bring them forth in proper words, they are then &s;trongly impre&s;t on our minds, and by a con&s;tant repetition of the &s;ame means by which they fir&s;t &s;truck root, mu&s;t always live and flouri&s;h in our memories. When the thoughts which we entertain upon a &s;urvey of our &s;ins and ne|ce&s;&s;ities &s;o far influence us as to incline us to Prayer, when we bring them forth be|fore the Mo&s;t High, cloathed in proper expre&s;&s;ions and attended with &s;uitable ge&s;|tures, they are thereby mo&s;t deeply im|printed on our minds, and by a &s;teady and uniform performance of this duty, are at la&s;t fixed in &s;uch &s;trong colours, as never to be di&s;charged; whereas had they never i&s;&s;ued from the clo&s;et of our hearts, they might
<PB N="14" REF="27">
have been &s;trangled in the birth, or proved the children but of a melancholy moment.</P>
<P>To be in fault, and a&s;hamed to confe&s;s it and a&s;k pardon, to be in want and a&s;hamed to acknowledge it and a&s;k relief, are mo&s;t certain &s;igns of an ob&s;tinate and proud tem|per; a temper not at all qualified to receive ble&s;&s;ings from God, who re&s;i&s;teth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Before we can expect favours from God, we mu&s;t en|tirely root out the&s;e faults, and in their &s;tead implant humility and meekne&s;s; nor is there any better way of enabling us &s;o to do, no other way of &s;hewing that we have &s;o done, than the performance of the duty of Prayer.</P>
<P>In the common affairs of this world we do not expect our faults to be pardoned, nor our wants to be relieved before they are made known, and &s;urely in point of com|mon decency we cannot expect ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings from a Being &s;uch as God is, upon ea&s;ier terms than tho&s;e which we perform
<PB N="15" REF="28">
to our Brethren, for things of little or no con&s;equence. However exten&s;ive the divine knowledge may be, how intimately &s;oever God may be acquainted with our wants be|fore we cry unto him, yet we mu&s;t not ex|pect that he will intere&s;t him&s;elf in our be|half, until we &s;hew by Prayer, that we are known not only to him, but al&s;o to our|&s;elves, the mo&s;t difficult but mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary of all knowledge, which &s;hould always accompany, and can &s;carce &s;ub&s;i&s;t, with|out the performance of this duty.</P>
<P>But, &s;ay they again, though it may be rea|&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary to pray to a Being of infinite knowledge, &s;urely it cannot be &s;o to pray to a Being of perfect Goodne&s;s, who is readier to hear than we to pray, readier to forgive our &s;ins, and relieve our wants, than we are even to acknowledge them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who argue thus have very mi&s;|taken notions of the divine nature; they con&s;ider God's Attributes ab&s;tractedly from, nay, in oppo&s;ition to, each other, and there|by
<PB N="16" REF="29">
make him incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf. We ought always to con&s;ider the perfec|tions of the deity as compatible with each other, as moving in the mo&s;t perfect har|mony, as being but &s;o many rays derived from, and centered in the &s;ame Body of Light and Perfection. His Mercy is not incon&s;i&s;tent with his Ju&s;tice, neither does his wi&s;dom exclude, or is it excluded by his Goodne&s;s; he is infinitely merciful, in &s;uch a manner as to be, at the &s;ame time, infinitely ju&s;t; infinitely wi&s;e, in &s;uch a manner as to be infinitely good. We mu&s;t not therefore entertain &s;uch high notions of any one Perfection, as to exalt it at the expence of any other; we mu&s;t not, as tho&s;e do who make God's goodne&s;s an ar|gument again&s;t prayer, magnify his good|ne&s;s at the expence of his Wi&s;dom. For whatever goodne&s;s it might &s;hew, yet cer|tainly it would be no mark of Wi&s;dom to confer Ble&s;&s;ings on us, what&s;oever we &s;tood in need of, without our petitioning for them. Tho&s;e per&s;ons can never be the proper objects of God's goodne&s;s who are
<PB N="17" REF="30">
above praying for the effects of it. The tendere&s;t Father breathing, although he plainly di&s;cerns in the whole behaviour of an offending Child that he is heartily &s;orry for his Offence, doth not extend to him the u&s;ual expre&s;&s;ions of his Love and Fa|vour, till he makes acknowledgement of his crime, and a&s;ks pardon for it; neither will God, how great &s;oever his delight in mercy and goodne&s;s, exert tho&s;e amiable attributes in our behalf, till we call upon him by Prayer and Supplication. If our wants were to be redre&s;&s;ed, and our de&s;ires fulfilled without any thing done on our parts, we might impute &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings to any rather than the true cau&s;e, and &s;o de|prive God of the glory of his di&s;pen&s;ations; whereas now, when they are made, as it were, the con&s;equence of our Prayers, we cannot but be &s;en&s;ible, that to God we owe them, and to God we ought to be thankful for them.</P>
<P>But, &s;ay they, though it may be rea&s;on|able and nece&s;&s;ary to pray to a Being of in|finite
<PB N="18" REF="31">
knowledge and goodne&s;s, &s;urely it cannot be &s;o, to pray to a Being of ab&s;o|lute immutability, who is not a Man that he &s;hould lie, nor the &s;on of Man, that he &s;hould repent; in whom there is no va|riablene&s;s, nor &s;hadow of turning; &s;o that our prayers cannot have any effect to the changing of his purpo&s;e, and rever&s;ing his decrees.</P>
<P>God's threats and promi&s;es have always a regard to the Behaviour of Men, and have a condition implied if not expre&s;t; &s;o that tho&s;e who fall off from virtue unto vice, in&s;tead of being heirs to his pro|mi&s;es, become liable to his threats; and tho&s;e who return from vice to virtue, in|&s;tead of being obnoxious to his threats be|come entitled to his promi&s;es; the change is not in God, but in us; his fixt and im|mutable purpo&s;e is to pur&s;ue vice with pu|ni&s;hment, and virtue with reward, through all the varying &s;cenes of man's behaviour; and therefore, upon a change in that, he alters his mea&s;ures, not thereby becoming
<PB N="19" REF="32">
mutable, but continuing con&s;tant to his fir&s;t re&s;olution, of puni&s;hing the wicked, and rewarding the good. It is therefore no diminution to the divine immutability to li&s;ten to the Petitions of his Creatures, and grant them tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings upon their praying to him, which he had withheld from them upon their neglecting to do it; to &s;upply or prevent tho&s;e wants which he had brought or determined to bring upon them, when they acknowledge their de|pendance and confidence in his goodne&s;s, together with tho&s;e other virtues, which Prayer does naturally &s;uppo&s;e, and out|wardly expre&s;s.</P>
<P>Trifling as the&s;e objections are found on examination, they are by much the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t plau&s;ible that the enemies of Prayer have been able to advance; they are of &s;uch a nature as to bring the under|&s;tanding, as well as the integrity, of tho&s;e who broach them into di&s;repute, and make us doubtful which to de&s;pi&s;e mo&s;t, the wickedne&s;s of their hearts, or the weak|ne&s;s
<PB N="20" REF="33">
of their heads. Little can be offered for tho&s;e who object to the my&s;teries of our mo&s;t holy religion, but le&s;s can be &s;aid for tho&s;e who object to the duties of it; the former, though not again&s;t, are yet much above our rea&s;on, but the latter lie exactly level to our under&s;tandings, and are not le&s;s &s;trongly recommended by Rea&s;on, than by Revelation; they are &s;uch as the heathen Philo&s;ophers were proud to em|belli&s;h their &s;y&s;tems with, though they cannot be dige&s;ted by &s;ome of our politer Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>It is not however to be wondered at, that tho&s;e who go on in a cour&s;e of wick|edne&s;s, &s;hould object to duties &s;o contrary to their head&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, and be willing to overthrow tho&s;e laws which lay a re|&s;traint upon their inclinations. It is In|tere&s;t, and not Rea&s;on, which &s;peaks in them, they are again&s;t Religion upon no other account, but becau&s;e Religion is again&s;t them, and think Chri&s;tianity un|rea&s;onable for no other cau&s;e, but that
<PB N="21" REF="34">
they wi&s;h it &s;o. In general it may be ob|&s;erved, that the lives of tho&s;e who object to this duty of Prayer, or any other en|joined in Scripture, are &s;ufficient to con|fute their objections, which can come with no &s;trength, but from the mouths of tho&s;e who appear in their lives to be at lea&s;t good moral men: but &s;uch, I tru&s;t, are in a much fairer way of believing the my&s;teries than objecting to the duties of the Chri&s;tian Religion, which is not le&s;s remarkable for matters of Faith than Practice, for the Revelation of truths, than the perfecting of virtue.</P>

<Q><HI>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Nature of Prayer, the Grounds on which that Duty is founded, and the rea&s;onablene&s;s of our performing it, are what I apprehend few can be ignorant of; none indeed, who are con&s;tant in the wor&s;hip of God and the &s;ervice of the Sanctuary. But I fear, we have not the &s;ame rea&s;on to believe, that the right man|ner of per&s;orming this duty is &s;o generally known, or at lea&s;t that it is &s;o generally practi&s;ed; &s;ince very &s;light ob&s;ervation may a&s;&s;ure us, that a great part even of tho&s;e who &s;trictly comply with the for|malities of prayer, are either ignorant of
<PB N="24" REF="36">
the manner in which it &s;hould be per|formed &s;o as to prove effectual, or indif|ferent whether it proves effectual or not. I &s;hall make it my bu&s;ine&s;s therefore to &s;hew,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The qualifications requi&s;ite to make our prayers acceptable to God&mdash;and in order to engage us more heartily therein, &s;hall,</P>
<P>Secondly, Mention tho&s;e advantages which we may rea&s;onably expect from a due di&s;charge of that Duty.</P>
<P>There are, it is to be feared, many per|&s;ons in the world who imagine them&s;elves worthy performers of this duty, merely becau&s;e they are regular and con&s;tant in &s;aying over a few prayers without recti|fying the temper of their minds, or alter|ing the method of their lives. But alas! how much are the&s;e mi&s;taken! No petition can po&s;&s;ibly be acceptable to God, which is not offered up with proper Affections,
<PB N="25" REF="37">
which is not attended with proper Actions. Was it merely the repetition of a Prayer which called down Ble&s;&s;ings from above, tho&s;e who pray through o&s;tentation, and a de&s;ire of being &s;een of men, or through prudential and intere&s;ted motives, might expect them equally with the &s;incere and contrite, and tho&s;e who, like the heathen, and our modern enthu&s;ia&s;ts, make u&s;e of long prayers, might expect ble&s;&s;ings &s;o much greater than others, as their prayers are longer. But of the fir&s;t of the&s;e our Saviour has a&s;&s;ured us that they have their reward; that is, they have the good opinion of men, which they &s;ought after, and mu&s;t not expect any reward from God; of the latter, he implies to us that they are not heard for their much &s;peaking; and of all in general who&s;e prayers are out&s;ide &s;hew, he pronounces, that the Lord dete&s;teth tho&s;e who approach him with their lips, whil&s;t their hearts are far from him.</P>
<P>Sincerity is the life of prayer; it is that which makes it an act of true devo|tion,
<PB N="26" REF="38">
and of high price in the &s;ight of God; and this virtue we may be &s;ure we have in a good degree, when we endeavour to purify our minds from all iniquity, and a&s;k nothing but with a good and upright intention. God, who &s;ees the heart, will not merely con&s;ider whether the things we pray for are good in them&s;elves, but whether they will be &s;o in our u&s;e of them; whether we &s;hall employ them to &s;uch good and virtuous purpo&s;es, as may pro|mote his glory, and our own good. If we therefore pray with a corrupt intention, we mu&s;t not expect that God will incline his ear to us; for the Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us, that on this account many a&s;k, and re|ceive not, becau&s;e they a&s;k ami&s;s, that they may con&s;ume it upon their lu&s;ts.</P>
<P>To &s;incerity we mu&s;t al&s;o add humility. This virtue naturally ari&s;es from the duty it&s;elf, the performance of which &s;uppo&s;es want in us who a&s;k, and power in him of whom we a&s;k; dependance on our parts, and &s;overeignty on God's. This humility
<PB N="27" REF="39">
con&s;i&s;ts not only in being &s;en&s;ible of and ac|knowledging our wants, but al&s;o in being &s;en&s;ible of, and acknowledging our un|worthine&s;s to have them redre&s;t. The man who is not &s;en&s;ible of his wants, will not be &s;en&s;ible of relief; he who feels his ne|ce&s;&s;ities, and yet is too proud to acknow|ledge them, will be too proud al&s;o to ac|knowledge the hand by which he is re|lieved; he la&s;tly, who is both &s;en&s;ible of his wants, and humble enough to acknow|ledge them, but yet is puffed up with an high opinion of his own worthine&s;s, will impute the relief of them not to God's free mercies, but to a con&s;ideration of his own de&s;erts; in&s;tead of coming boldly to the throne of Grace, he will come ra&s;hly to the throne of Judgement; in&s;tead of plead|ing and relying upon the merits of Chri&s;t, he will plead and rely upon his own. To make our prayers therefore acceptable to God, and our humility complete, we mu&s;t acknowledge that our &s;ins and wants are great, but our unworthine&s;s to have them pardoned and relieved &s;till greater; we
<PB N="28" REF="40">
mu&s;t confe&s;s that when we have done our be&s;t, we are but unprofitable &s;ervants, we mu&s;t throw our&s;elves upon the mercy of God, and plead no merits but tho&s;e of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>This humility of the heart will natu|rally produce that of the body, or a grave and reverend deportment in our devotions, expre&s;&s;ive of the low opinion which we have of our&s;elves, and of the high one which we entertain of God. When we are in the pre&s;ence of an earthly monarch we place a particular regard on all our words and actions, &s;o that they may de|clare the high veneration we have of his maje&s;ty and power; and if this is rea&s;on|able, &s;urely it is much more &s;o, that we &s;hould ob&s;erve the &s;ame method when we come into the pre&s;ence of the king of Heaven, and expre&s;s the utmo&s;t reverence when we con&s;ider that the place we &s;tand on is holy ground, is &s;anctified and con&s;e|crated by the gracious pre&s;ence of God him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="41">
To the&s;e qualifications of an acceptable prayer, we mu&s;t al&s;o add that of Confi|dence, or a firm per&s;ua&s;ion that we &s;hall obtain what we a&s;k for, if it is expedient for us. Upon fir&s;t coming into the pre|&s;ence of God, and con&s;idering his nature and our own, we &s;hould naturally be more apt to fear and to de&s;pair, than to re|po&s;e any confidence in him. To con&s;ider him as exalted in maje&s;ty and power, our|&s;elves as weak and impotent; him as a mo&s;t pure and holy Being, our&s;elves as &s;tained and polluted with &s;in, mu&s;t breed in us apprehen&s;ions far different from tho&s;e plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations which Confidence in|&s;pires. But when we con&s;ider that he is a God of Mercy, long-&s;uffering, and of great goodne&s;s, that he &s;o loved the world, as to &s;end his only &s;on to &s;uffer for it, that he hath commanded us to pray to him, and promi&s;ed to hear and grant our reque&s;ts, the fear which we before felt immediately &s;ub&s;ides, and Confidence, in its highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, ari&s;es in it's &s;tead; Confidence of being heard, forgiven, and relieved. We
<PB N="30" REF="42">
then find that not to pray to him is to di&s;|obey his authority, and not to believe that our Prayers &s;hall be heard and granted, is to derogate from his Goodne&s;s, and di&s;tru&s;t his promi&s;es. We mu&s;t not therefore let our humility &s;o far prevail as to plunge us into de&s;pair, or abate our Confidence; nor our confidence get &s;o much the better, as to overthrow our humility, and hurry us into pre&s;umption; but let both move in their proper &s;phere, and keep our &s;ouls in a due temper; when we con&s;ider our wants and unworthine&s;s let us be humble, when we con&s;ider God's mercies let us be confident, and &s;o offer up our Prayers a rea&s;onable and acceptable &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Another qualification of an acceptable Prayer, is Attention; this is not to be ac|quired &s;o ea&s;ily as &s;ome may imagine; our thoughts are in a perpetual flux, and of &s;o volatile a nature, that it is no ea&s;y matter to keep them fixt and &s;teady, even when we are retired from the world, and all outward objects are taken away. The mind is ever
<PB N="31" REF="43">
roving, and &s;o di&s;tracted with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h ideas which ari&s;e involuntarily in her, that it is no contemptible ta&s;k, after &s;he has made choice of any one, to &s;hut out the re&s;t, and keep her&s;elf attentive to that alone. Be&s;ides, the cares of this world are apt to intrude, and interrupt us, the enticing allurements of plea&s;ures are ever ready to in&s;inuate them&s;elves, and the Devil is always at hand to &s;econd every in|&s;trument, and improve every opportunity of diverting our thoughts from the &s;ervice of God. As our tempers and circum&s;tances are well known to him, he is particularly diligent in the time of our devotions to un|hinge our thoughts, by &s;upplying us with &s;uch objects and ideas as he thinks will be&s;t &s;erve his wicked purpo&s;es. It is evi|dent therefore, that our utmo&s;t care and re&s;olution is nece&s;&s;ary to acquire this vir|tue of Attention; and in order the better to effect it, we &s;hould rightly weigh the Maje&s;ty of him whom we pray to, and the importance of the things which we pray for. The man who petitions an
<PB N="32" REF="44">
earthly King for &s;uch things as are nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;upport his life, or for the pardon of &s;ome crime which forfeits it, mu&s;t na|turally be &s;uppo&s;ed to have his attention wholly engro&s;t with a con&s;ideration of the Maje&s;ty before whom he &s;tands, and of the va&s;t con&s;equence of tho&s;e things which are the &s;ubjects of his petition; and the &s;ame degree of Attention may we hope to obtain, if we will convince our&s;elves, that in our Prayers we come before the King of Kings, and that what we petition for is of the la&s;t con&s;equence to us, no le&s;s than the &s;upply of all our wants, no le&s;s than the forgivene&s;s of all our &s;ins.</P>
<P>If we thus u&s;e every method to &s;ettle our|&s;elves into an habit of Attention, if we en|deavour to repre&s;s every wandering thought in the birth, and are heartily &s;orry when they force them&s;elves into our minds, if we &s;incerely pray that God will enable us, by his grace, to overcome them, and give us this virtue to a greater degree, than our na|tural infirmities will permit us to acquire of
<PB N="33" REF="45">
our&s;elves, we have then all the rea&s;on in the world to conclude, that God will crown our endeavours with &s;ucce&s;s, or otherwi&s;e accept of the &s;incere endeavour, in&s;tead of the perfect performance; nor will the author of our nature require more of us, than our nature will enable us to perform, but will look upon our infirmities with an eye of pity and compa&s;&s;ion, and extend his grace and pardon to them.</P>
<P>To Attention we mu&s;t add Fervency: it is not a cold and unmeaning repetition of Prayers which calls down ble&s;&s;ings from above; it is not a mere form of words, but the effectual fervent Prayer, which availeth much. This qualification greatly depends upon Temper and Con&s;titution. Tho&s;e therefore &s;hould not be ca&s;t down who feel not the&s;e holy raptures in &s;uch a degree as others may &s;eem to do, nor &s;hould tho&s;e of a more &s;anguine complexion be over and above mea&s;ure elated, when they feel the&s;e tran&s;ports, and bla&s;phemou&s;ly fancy that they are, in the language of a modern
<PB N="34" REF="46">
Enthu&s;ia&s;t, &s;en&s;ibly actuated by the Holy Gho&s;t. Fervency, no doubt, is a very ne|ce&s;&s;ary and happy qualification of Prayer; it introduces us to a more intimate fami|liarity with God, and at the &s;ame time it procures us ble&s;&s;ings on earth, in &s;ome mea&s;ure gives us a foreta&s;te of Heaven. But great caution is requi&s;ite, that this fer|vency be &s;uch as is required by God; it &s;hould be a gentle, plea&s;ing, heavenly flame, and not an head&s;trong and outrageous fire, which hurries men into Enthu&s;ia&s;m; it &s;hould, like the Sun, not only afford a barren warmth to the &s;oul, but &s;uch an heat, as may promote fruitfulne&s;s in well doing.</P>
<P>To the foregoing qualifications we mu&s;t add Per&s;everance. We mu&s;t not imagine, that a tran&s;itory &s;park of devotion will in|flame our Prayers &s;o as to make them a &s;acrifice acceptable to God. Some heavy misfortune, or impending danger, &s;ome &s;troke of &s;ickne&s;s, &s;ome bad con&s;equence of our evil cour&s;es; &s;ome more than u&s;u|ally
<PB N="35" REF="47">
&s;evere remon&s;trance of con&s;cience, may make the wickede&s;t man alive, in his agony and fright, betake him&s;elf to Prayer, till his danger is over and his con&s;cience lulled a&s;leep. But the man who is really in earne&s;t, and concerned for the &s;ucce&s;s of his prayers, who is willing to perform the conditions, that he may be entitled to the ble&s;&s;ings which God has promi&s;ed, in whatever &s;tate he is, whether in &s;ickne&s;s or in health, in pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity, per&s;everes &s;teadily in an habit of Prayer; he reflects, that tho&s;e who are &s;o often in want, &s;o often entangled in &s;in, &s;hould often pray for the relief of the one and the forgivene&s;s of the other; and he con&s;iders it as his great ble&s;&s;ing, that in his di&s;tre&s;&s;es he has &s;o kind a God to whom he may betake him&s;elf, &s;o prevailing a means as Prayer by which he may apply to him. If his de&s;ires are not immediately granted, he does not conclude them ab&s;olutely rejected, he does not de&s;i&s;t from this duty, but per|&s;everes inviolably in it, firmly believing that he &s;hall &s;ee the goodne&s;s of the Lord
<PB N="36" REF="48">
in the land of the living. God may for a time, in his wi&s;e and good providence, with-hold our de&s;ires from us, and yet fulfill them afterwards, when they more contribute to his glory or our good; and the parable of the unju&s;t Judge, and poor Widow, doth very &s;trongly enforce on us that duty, which our Saviour intended to confirm in it, always to pray, and not to faint.</P>
<P>To the abovementioned qualifications of an acceptable Prayer we mu&s;t add, la&s;tly, a lively Faith in Chri&s;t; &s;uch a Faith as may be a proper foundation for us to build the other qualifications upon, &s;uch a Faith as doth not overthrow good works, but produceth them, her&s;elf working by Love. The light of natural rea&s;on directs us to offer up our Prayers to God only; but the Scriptures further inform us, that they mu&s;t be offered up through Chri&s;t. It is by his merits only, that we can expect to have our &s;ins forgiven, and our wants &s;up|plied. He is the merciful High Prie&s;t,
<PB N="37" REF="49">
who having felt our infirmities has learned to compa&s;&s;ionate them; having experienced our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, is become willing to relieve them; and having born temptation, is both able and willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in, and deliver us out of it: he receives our prayers, offers them up to God, intercedes in our behalf, and backs our petitions with his own pre|vailing merits; &s;o that there is no good thing which we may not hope for, through his mediation.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ure, Honour, and Profit, are the three great idols of the modern world, and engro&s;s the adoration of much the greate&s;t part of mankind, the Sen&s;ual, the Ambi|tious, and the Covetous. It is through the inducements of the&s;e prevailing pa&s;|&s;ions, that our hearts are entirely weaned from the con&s;ideration of another life, and rivetted on this; it is one or all of the&s;e which make us &s;it loo&s;e to the duty of Prayer, and think every moment &s;pent therein precious time lo&s;t from the pur&s;uit of our darling objects. But if it will appear
<PB N="38" REF="50">
(as to an unprejudiced per&s;on I am &s;ure it will) that Prayer is the be&s;t means of afford|ing not only one of the&s;e advantages &s;epa|rately, but all of them conjunctively, and each of them in a greater degree than we could enjoy without it, then we certainly have a very &s;trong argument to enforce this duty, as well upon the intere&s;ts as the con&s;ciences of mankind.</P>
<P>The man of Plea&s;ure may boa&s;t of his enjoyments, and tho&s;e noble indulgencies of his &s;en&s;uality, in which the Brutes may vie with him, nay, in one re&s;pect, far ex|cell him, in that they feel no remor&s;e, no compunction afterwards, and to &s;uch an one (whil&s;t he continues &s;uch) it will be in vain to repre&s;ent the more &s;olid, la&s;ting, and &s;uperior plea&s;ures which are to be found in a &s;incere performance of the duty of Prayer. But if we make our appeal to the hearts of tho&s;e who are inflamed with true devotion, and can reli&s;h the ex|erci&s;es of Piety, we may be ea&s;ily &s;atisfied, that one moment &s;pent in the di&s;charge of
<PB N="39" REF="51">
this duty, will much outweigh an whole life &s;pent in the indulgence of Sen&s;uality and Libertini&s;m. So much as the Soul is &s;uperior to the body, &s;o much are the plea&s;ures of the one beyond tho&s;e of the other. Corporeal gratifications are violent, but not la&s;ting; they &s;oon cloy, and pall upon the appetite, and, notwith&s;tanding the charm of variety, grow tedious and in|&s;ipid. The plea&s;ures of the &s;oul are more &s;edate and temperate, more la&s;ting and per|manent; the more we u&s;e, the more we reli&s;h them, the longer we are acquainted with them, the more lovely they appear, and the &s;tronger they engage us. But of all the plea&s;ures of the &s;oul, tho&s;e which &s;he receives from the communication of God in the exerci&s;e of Prayer, are undoubt|edly the mo&s;t excellent, when &s;he mounts upon the wings of Devotion, and, dive&s;ted of earthly thoughts and affections, pene|trates into the highe&s;t Heaven, and enjoys the glorious pre&s;ence, and the gracious conver&s;ation of her God. Sen&s;ual gratifi|cations leave a &s;ting behind them, which
<PB N="40" REF="52">
the greate&s;t libertine in the world cannot always appea&s;e; he mu&s;t &s;ometimes in his cooler hours, feel the terrors, and groan be|neath the burden of an accu&s;ing con&s;cience; but the plea&s;ures re&s;ulting from Prayer, as they are free from all di&s;quietudes at the time, &s;o they are not terminated with the exerci&s;e it&s;elf, but diffu&s;e a &s;olid and la&s;ting &s;atisfaction over the &s;oul; and the action is not only plea&s;ant in the performance, but al&s;o in our con&s;ideration of it afterwards. A plea&s;ure this, which Vice may always wi&s;h for, but never can enjoy. We may therefore with great truth a&s;&s;ert, that what|ever the world may think, and wicked men may talk of plea&s;ure, it is never to be found till we become acquainted with God, till we are made &s;en&s;ible of his love, and en|joy that happy friend&s;hip, and communion with him, which is only expre&s;&s;ed and maintained by Prayer, and &s;piritual exer|ci&s;es.</P>
<P>But the performance of this duty is not only attended with Plea&s;ure, but Honour
<PB N="41" REF="53">
al&s;o. To enjoy the intimacy and friend|&s;hip of a monarch, to be admitted to his Pre&s;ence at all times, to be at liberty to pre&s;ent our petitions and be a&s;&s;ured of &s;uc|ce&s;s, is de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed a great honour; but how much greater is it to enjoy the friend&s;hip of the King of Kings, to have freedom of acce&s;s at all times, to lay open our wants, and make our di&s;tre&s;&s;es known, with that freedom and liberty which a man u&s;eth to his friend. A mighty privilege this &s;urely! an honour as much greater than the familiarity of an earthly king, as God is &s;uperior to the greate&s;t monarch; an honour, which is not to be &s;ought through difficulties, dangers, and uncer|tainties, but may be ea&s;ily, &s;afely, and certainly obtained by the meane&s;t man on earth; an honour, which does not depend upon the breath of an un&s;table and mi&s;|judging man, but on the favour of an im|mutable and all-wi&s;e God; an honour which is not to be acquired by violating our integrity, and contradicting the frame
<PB N="42" REF="54">
of our nature, but by pre&s;erving and com|plying with it; which is not to be &s;ought through the labyrinth of lies, flattery, and deceit, but in the plain road of truth, &s;in|cerity, and hone&s;ty; which is not to be obtained by envy, hatred, and ambition, but by love, charity, and humility; an honour which will not leave us in the grave, but accompany us to, and be per|fected in another life.</P>
<P>To the con&s;ideration of Plea&s;ure and Honour, let us add that of Profit al&s;o; and Profit redounding to us both in temporal and &s;piritual matters. Prayer is the be&s;t means of obtaining God's favour for the ac|qui&s;ition of what we want, and the Pre|&s;ervation of what we have. If we &s;earch the &s;criptures, we cannot but ob&s;erve the great prevalence of this duty with God, and have in&s;tances, in the hi&s;torical parts of them, of the great temporal ble&s;&s;ings which are to be procured by it, which are at large &s;et forth by Solomon.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="55">
If thy people I&s;rael be &s;mitten down before the enemy; if Heaven be &s;hut up, and there be no rain; if there be in the land famine, or pe&s;tilence, or if thy people go out to battle again&s;t their enemy, then, if they pray towards this place, and con|fe&s;s thy name, hear thou their Prayer in Heaven, thy dwelling place, deliver them from their affliction, and maintain their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus, according to Solomon, if a nation labours under the mi&s;eries of an un&s;ucce&s;sful war, Prayer is the &s;ure&s;t means to procure a glorious victory, and a happy peace; if the windows of Heaven be &s;hut up, and drought and barrenne&s;s prevail in the land, this is the mo&s;t effectual method to obtain the fertile &s;howers, &s;o that the earth may bring forth her fruits, that the hills may dance and &s;kip, and the valleys laugh and &s;ing for joy; is the air tainted with noxious vapours, and doth Pe&s;tilence, hand in hand with Famine, &s;talk in our &s;treets, the holy breathing of an upright heart in prayer will
<PB N="44" REF="56">
purge the air, and procure for us health and plenty. In a word, whatever misfor|tunes we labour under, whether publick or private, a due di&s;charge of this duty is able to remove them, and obtain God's ble&s;&s;ing upon our&s;elves and familes, our friends and acquaintance, upon every thing we have, and every thing we do.</P>
<P>To the&s;e advantages, which relate only to this life, let us al&s;o add tho&s;e which na|turally lead us to happine&s;s hereafter. Let us reflect what an increa&s;e of grace, what a confirmation of faith, what a quicken|ing of hope we may expect herefrom; and la&s;tly, let us reflect how much Prayer mu&s;t conduce to the advancement of virtue, and holine&s;s of living.</P>
<P>It naturally breeds in us due apprehen|&s;ions of God and our&s;elves; it &s;ets before us the perfections of the Deity in their full glory; it &s;uppo&s;es them, as to his moral attributes, the objects of our imitation, and makes them the &s;ubjects of our contempla|tion;
<PB N="45" REF="57">
&s;o that a con&s;tant performance of this duty can &s;carce fail of awakening our emulation, and as it were in&s;en&s;ibly con|forming us to the image of God. As it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for a great &s;inner to continue con&s;tant in this duty, &s;o is it as unlikely for a man who continues con&s;tant in Prayer to adhere to any wilful &s;in. Prayer is the natural enemy of Sin; it cannot con&s;i&s;t with it, but mu&s;t either conquer or be conquered by it; Prayer is the natural friend and ally of Holine&s;s and cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it, &s;o as to be worthy the name of Prayer; Prayer has a natural ten|dency to produce holine&s;s, and holine&s;s is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;anctify our Prayers.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AFTER our Saviour had given his di&s;ciples a charge not to imitate the hypocrites, who prayed &s;tanding in the &s;y|nagogues, and at the corners of the &s;treets, that they might be &s;een of men, nor to follow the example of the heathen, who u&s;ed vain repetitions, and thought they &s;hould be heard for their much &s;peaking, he proceeds to direct them in what man|ner they &s;hould offer up their prayers, and delivers that form which hath ju&s;tly been the admiration of all ages, and the divine pattern whereby the Chri&s;tian church hath modelled her devotions.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="59">
If we con&s;ider the Per&s;on who gave this Prayer to us, it claims our highe&s;t regard upon his account; or if we duly weigh the value of the gift it&s;elf, it de&s;erves our e&s;pecial e&s;teem upon its own. The Per&s;on who gave it to us, was no other than our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, who knew the wants and infirmities of our nature, being man, and the propere&s;t manner in which we could petition for the redre&s;s and relief of them, being God. The Prayer it&s;elf, whether we con&s;ider the order and harmony of it, the connexion of the parts, or the beauty of the whole, is worthy of the highe&s;t admiration. It is &s;o plain, and per&s;picuous, that the weake&s;t capacity may under&s;tand it; &s;o &s;hort and conci&s;e, that the weake&s;t memory may retain it; &s;o full and com|prehen&s;ive, that all our wants may very properly be reduced within the compa&s;s of it; in a word, it is of &s;uch intrin&s;ick worth, that unbelievers mu&s;t admire, though none but Chri&s;tians can worthily repeat it.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="60">
Our church hath &s;hewn that deference to this Prayer, that &s;he hath in&s;erted it in every di&s;tinct office of the whole Liturgy, rightly judging, that it would diffu&s;e a brightne&s;s around it, and atone for the imperfections of tho&s;e &s;ervices among&s;t which it was placed; &s;en&s;ible that there mu&s;t be imperfections in all human com|po&s;itions (though, vanity apart, our Liturgy is as perfect a work as humanity mu&s;t ever hope to reach) &s;he endeavours, by the fre|quent repetition of this Prayer, where all is perfect, all is worthy of the great author, to make up for her own defects; and pro|vidently con&s;idering how un&s;ettled the mind of man is, how perpetually roving from one idea to another, even during the time of prayer, &s;he hath wi&s;ely contrived to recall and fix his wandering thoughts, which the chains of human eloquence are too weak to bind, by frequently calling upon him to join in the repetition of that Prayer, which, if we had not the word of God for it, would of it&s;elf proclaim its di|vine original.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="61">
The &s;ame regard which the church pays to this prayer in her publick &s;ervices, doth it become every pious Chri&s;tian to pay to it in his private devotions. Though, the &s;oul pouring out her&s;elf before her Maker in &s;ecret, is left at greater liberty than in the great congregation, and is not bound by &s;et forms of human compo&s;ition, yet even there &s;he is not freed from this form, and if &s;he hath any true judgment of the real value of things, will not de&s;ire to be. Man, retired from the world, may take a greater &s;cope, more explicitly dwell upon his wants, and acknowledge his &s;ins; but, after all, he will find them here &s;ummed up and epitomized in &s;uch a manner, and in &s;uch words, as will put the highe&s;t elo|quence of man to the blu&s;h.</P>
<P>As the good man will always u&s;e this Prayer, becau&s;e Chri&s;t hath commanded it, &s;o the wi&s;e man will u&s;e it, becau&s;e he can find none that is comparable with it; it is the only Prayer which many, and the be&s;t which all can repeat; it is, in a word, that
<PB N="51" REF="62">
Prayer which the good Chri&s;tian will re|gulate all his devotions by, and which he will never omit to make a part of them.</P>
<P>Thus much ob&s;erved in general, I &s;hall make it my bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;et before you, in as plain and practical a manner as po&s;&s;ible, the true purport of each part of this divine Prayer, to mention the proper affections, and enforce the re&s;pective duties which ought to accompany our repetition of it, beginning with Our Father which art in Heaven. In my con&s;ideration of which words I &s;hall &s;hew,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, In what re&s;pects God is &s;aid to be our Father.</P>
<P>Secondly, Why we are taught in our Prayers to make u&s;e of the name of Father, rather than any other.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Why we are in&s;tructed to &s;ay our, and not, my Father.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="63">
Fourthly, In what re&s;pect God is &s;aid to be in Heaven.</P>
<P>Fifthly and la&s;tly, Why we are taught to make a particular mention of God's re&s;idence in Heaven, in our Prayers.</P>
<P>One of the re&s;pects in which God is &s;aid to be our Father, is Creation. This is a language u&s;ual even with Heathen writers, who acknowledging God to be the Maker of the world, do frequently &s;tile him the Father of it; &s;uppo&s;ing the act of Creation to be equivalent to that of generation, and that we are as much the children of him who created us in general, as of that indi|vidual per&s;on who begat us in particular. In this re&s;pect, God is the Father of all things, and the generations of the Heaven and the Earth, confe&s;s his Paternity; the rain claims him for a Father, and the drops of dew declare their having been begotten by him; but in a more emi|nent and exalted &s;en&s;e he is the Father of Man, having created him after his own
<PB N="53" REF="64">
image; whence Adam is called the Son of God, and Man may more e&s;pecially &s;ay with the Prophet, Have we not all one Father? Hath not one God created us?</P>
<P>Pre&s;ervation is another rea&s;on for our calling God Father, and the continuation of our exi&s;tence a perpetual obligation on us to make u&s;e of that name. If the fir&s;t giving of being is a proper foundation of Paternity, the pre&s;ervation of that Being, which is not improperly &s;tiled a Continued Creation, mu&s;t be a foundation of Pater|nity likewi&s;e; &s;o that God, who is our Father in right of having graciou&s;ly created us, is &s;till farther &s;o, in right of having no le&s;s graciou&s;ly pre&s;erved us.</P>
<P>Redemption is another rea&s;on for our calling God Father. The di&s;obedience of our fir&s;t parents brought them&s;elves and their po&s;terity into &s;o mi&s;erable an e&s;tate, their nature was &s;o corrupted, their un|der&s;tanding &s;o darkened, and their will &s;o perver&s;e, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them
<PB N="54" REF="65">
to fulfill the law of nature, and without fulfilling it, it was ab&s;olutely certain, that they mu&s;t fall into condemnation. In this deplorable condition, the mercy of God regarded us; he made a covenant with his only begotten Son, that he &s;hould come into the world, and die for mankind, and, upon the merit of that, cancel the hand|writing of the law, which bore &s;o hard upon us; that he &s;hould afford us ea&s;ier con|ditions, greater a&s;&s;i&s;tances, and more glo|rious promi&s;es, that he &s;hould deprive Sin of her &s;trength, &s;wallow up Death in Vic|tory, and lead Captivity captive; that he &s;hould redeem us from the claim of Hell, and rein&s;tate us in our title to the joys of Heaven. For this rea&s;on therefore it is al&s;o, that we confe&s;s the Paternity of God, that we joyfully look upon our Creator and Pre&s;erver as amiably cloathed with the mercies of a Redeemer, and as thereby ac|quiring a fre&s;h title to the name of Father, in that he hath begotten us from the death of Sin, unto the life of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="66">
Regeneration is another rea&s;on for our calling God Father. In re&s;pect of Crea|tion, and Pre&s;ervation, all things in gene|ral may call upon God by this name; in re&s;pect of tho&s;e many excellent endow|ments by which human nature is exalted above the inferior parts of the creation, and in which &s;he bears the image of God, the whole race of men may with equal pro|priety make u&s;e of this appellation; and the Paternity ari&s;ing from Redemption is as univer&s;al as the Satisfaction of Chri&s;t, who died for all men; but in re&s;pect of Rege|neration, no one can call God Father, who is not actually entered into the Go&s;pel Covenant, and become a member of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath not been &s;prinkled with the laver of Regeneration, and &s;anctified by the Holy Gho&s;t; who&s;oever believeth that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, is born of God. If we con&s;ider indeed the wonderful altera|tion which is made in us by the gracious operations of God's holy Spirit in our Re|generation, how thoroughly we are puri|fied when baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t
<PB N="56" REF="67">
and with fire, upon what different prin|ciples we think, &s;peak, and act, we &s;hall readily &s;ee that &s;uch an alteration may ju&s;tly be &s;tiled a new birth, we who have undergone it new Creatures, and God who hath perfected it in us, and created us in good works unto Chri&s;t Je&s;us, upon this account al&s;o a Father to us.</P>
<P>Adoption is another rea&s;on for our calling God Father. It hath been u&s;ual among men, for tho&s;e who are childle&s;s to adopt the children of others, and to confer the &s;ame obligations on, and expect the &s;ame affection and obedience from them, as if they were their own offspring. Thus hath God dealt with us; he hath prede&s;tinated us to the adoption of Children, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to him&s;elf, and hath given us the &s;pirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father. But the motives on which men adopt children, and tho&s;e on which God adopts us, are widely different. They fly to adoption as the la&s;t re&s;ource and comfort of their &s;olitary condition, as an artificial
<PB N="57" REF="68">
means of &s;upplying them&s;elves with what Nature hath denied them, and in expecta|tion of plea&s;ure and ble&s;&s;ing to them&s;elves. Whereas God hath adopted us, not for his own, but for our &s;ake; not that he may be a Father, but that we may be children; the love is all his, the advantage all our own.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;een in what re&s;pects we call God Father, I proceed, Secondly, to &s;hew, Why we are taught in our prayers to make u&s;e of the name of Father, rather than any other.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider with what affections of the mind our prayers ought always to be accompanied, with what humility and re|verence, with what love and confidence, with what re&s;olution of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience, we &s;hall find that no other name could &s;o naturally in&s;pire us with them, as this of Father. The idea of Om|nipotence is great and terrible, and, ab|&s;tractedly con&s;idered, will indeed &s;uffici|ently
<PB N="58" REF="69">
excite our humility and reverence, but by no means our love. The idea of infinite Goodne&s;s is truly amiable and lovely, but, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, not at all calculated to rai&s;e in us humility and fear. The idea of perfect Ju&s;tice will breed de&s;pair, and the con&s;ideration of infinite Mercy create pre&s;umption rather than confidence. Eter|nity and Immen&s;ity &s;trike us with admira|tion, but are above our comprehen&s;ion; and perfect Holine&s;s and Purity, though exceeding lovely in them&s;elves, are too bright and dazzling for the eyes of &s;inners. But in the name of Father all the&s;e per|fections of the Deity are collectively un|der&s;tood, as centered in the &s;ame per&s;on, as moving in the mo&s;t perfect harmony, as being in fact the &s;ame &s;imple e&s;&s;ence di&s;playing it&s;elf &s;everal ways, and demand|ing of us &s;everal affections.</P>
<P>Humility and reverence are expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect, which all good children pay to their earthly parents, and which, if they are &s;incere when they call God Father,
<PB N="59" REF="70">
they mu&s;t in a much greater degree pay to him. His adorable Maje&s;ty, his incom|prehen&s;ible greatne&s;s, and Almighty Power, demand this of us. There is nothing which more powerfully works upon us to love any per&s;on, than his having conferred favours on us, and given us expre&s;&s;ions of his good will and affection; and the greater his good will appears to be, the greater the favours are which we receive, the greater in proportion &s;hould our love be to him. Now, as there is no per&s;on who hath conferred upon us, in any compari&s;on, &s;o great benefits as God, &s;o there is no name &s;o proper to remind us of them, as this of Father, which pre&s;ents him to our thoughts at once as our Creator, Pre&s;erver, and Redeemer, as regenerating us by his holy Spirit, and adopting us in his ble&s;&s;ed Son; and con&s;equently no name is &s;o pro|per to excite in us that ardent love and af|fection which God requires.</P>
<P>Upon coming into the pre&s;ence of a God, who declares him&s;elf of purer eyes
<PB N="60" REF="71">
than to behold iniquity, &s;inners &s;hould na|turally tremble and de&s;pair; but the name of Father conveys to us &s;o tender an idea, as calms our terrors, and in&s;pires hope and confidence, teaching us, that if our Fathers, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto their children, how much more &s;hall our Father which is in Heaven, give to tho&s;e who call upon him? But notwith&s;tanding the name of Father gives us &s;o favourable an idea, yet there is in it &s;ufficient awe and dignity to excite and claim our obedience. Parents after the fle&s;h love their children, li&s;ten to their petitions, forgive their faults, and relieve their wants; but parents after the fle&s;h expect al&s;o to be obeyed; and &s;o does God; we have no title to his mercy till we endeavour, by a &s;incere, though im|perfect, obedience, to &s;atisfy his Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>When we a&s;k any favours of our ac|quaintance, and meet with a denial, we are apt to harbour a re&s;entment again&s;t them, and to impute their refu&s;al to indifference, pride, ill-nature, or &s;uch like motives;
<PB N="61" REF="72">
but when our parents deny our reque&s;ts we feel no &s;uch re&s;entments, we are well &s;atisfied of their love, and repute even their denial an argument of it. Thus, when we offer up our prayers to God, we are, by making u&s;e of the name of Father, taught the mo&s;t profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re&s;ignation, committing the &s;ucce&s;s of our prayers entirely to his plea&s;ure, and de|termining to look on the afflictions which he lays on us as Fatherly corrections, and on the things which he withholds from us, as &s;uch which it is more our intere&s;t to want than to obtain. Thus we &s;ee, that the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;on why we are taught in our prayers to make u&s;e of the name of Father, rather than any other, is, becau&s;e that name is more proper than any other to &s;et before us the mercies we have received, and in|&s;pire us with &s;uch affections, as ought to &s;anctify our prayers.</P>
<P>The next thing in cour&s;e is to enquire, Why we are taught in our prayers to &s;ay <HI>our,</HI> and not <HI>my</HI> Father.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="73">
We are the children of God only in an improper &s;en&s;e, and as the phra&s;e of gene|ration is applied unto &s;everal acts of the &s;ame nature with, or is attended with the &s;ame con&s;equences as generation in its pro|per &s;en&s;e. But Chri&s;t is truly and properly the Son of God, by a true and proper ge|neration; we are &s;ons in &s;uch a manner as to have our &s;on&s;hip in common with others, &s;o that any other part of the creation may join with us in calling upon God as a Father; and therefore we &s;ay <HI>our</HI> Father. Chri&s;t is a Son in &s;uch a manner, that no one can call God Father in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e which he does; and therefore <HI>my</HI> Father &s;eems an expre&s;&s;ion which, though not im|proper in our mouths, is yet mo&s;t proper in his.</P>
<P>In Scripture our Lord &s;eems de&s;ignedly indu&s;trious to di&s;tingui&s;h between our Son|&s;hip and his own, never in his di&s;cour&s;es of <HI>his</HI> relation to God, &s;aying, <HI>our,</HI> but <HI>my</HI> Father; never, in his di&s;cour&s;es of <HI>our</HI> relation to God, &s;aying <HI>our,</HI> but <HI>your</HI> Father,

unle&s;s in this prayer; where we are to be &s;uppo&s;ed as the &s;peakers, exclu&s;ive of him; &s;o that this difference of expre&s;&s;ion &s;eems to be a di&s;tinction between the true, proper, and eternal generation of the Son of God, and the improper generation of the creature born in time.</P>
<P>In regard to practice, we are taught to &s;ay <HI>our,</HI> and not <HI>my</HI> Father, to inculcate the duty of an univer&s;al love and charity to all mankind, and that it is incumbent on us to extend our prayers to all per&s;ons what&s;o|ever, praying not only for our relations and friends, but al&s;o for our enemies, per&s;ecu|tors, and &s;landerers, that it may plea&s;e God to forgive them, and to turn their hearts. We are all the children of the &s;ame Father, we have all one Creator and Pre|&s;erver, and ought therefore to exerci&s;e an univer&s;al charity, in imitation of God's univer&s;al Providence, who cau&s;eth the &s;un to ri&s;e, and the rain to de&s;cend both upon the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t. But a more par|ticular love is due to our fellow Chri&s;tians;
<PB N="64" REF="75">
for the&s;e we ought to pray with the greate&s;t zeal, with the&s;e we ought to live in the mo&s;t perfect harmony, and as we are the children of one Father, namely, God, and the members of one Body, namely, Chri&s;t, &s;o ought we to have but one heart, and one mind.</P>
<P>On the whole therefore, if when we &s;ay <HI>our</HI> Father, our hearts are filled with hu|mility and reverence, with love and confi|dence, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience, with charity and benevolence, we may with good rea&s;on conclude, that we are properly qua|lified to repeat the&s;e words, that we are indeed God's Children, and he our Father. But on the contrary, if our hearts are puffed up with pride and haughtine&s;s, &s;unk into indifference, or overcome with di&s;tru&s;t, if there lurk in us any &s;eeds of di&s;content and di&s;obedience to God, of envy, hatred, malice, or uncharitablene&s;s to man, this name will but aggravate our guilt, and in|crea&s;e our condemnation, in that &s;o great mercies vouch&s;afed to us by God, and pre|&s;ented

to our thoughts by the name of Father, have had no greater effect on us, nor been &s;ufficient to root out tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions, which are directly repugnant to his nature. To come into God's pre&s;ence with the name of Father in our mouths, unle&s;s we have the affections flowing from it ever warm at our hearts, and influencing our lives, is a piece of hypocri&s;y which cannot lye hid from God's infinite knowledge, nor e&s;cape his perfect ju&s;tice. The mention of this name, at the &s;ame time it reminds us of what God has done for us, &s;hould remind us of what we ought, in obedience to him, to do for our&s;elves; and then only can we properly call God our Father, when we &s;incerely endeavour to approve our&s;elves his children.</P>
<P>The next part of this divine prayer which comes under con&s;ideration, pre&s;ents God to our minds as being in Heaven.</P>
<P>The&s;e words, which art in Heaven, are not de&s;igned to limit or confine the divine
<PB N="66" REF="77">
nature, to &s;ay here it is, and there it is not, but to breed in us a due apprehen&s;ion and e&s;teem of God's Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>In regard of his natural or e&s;&s;ential pre|&s;ence, he fills all his works, and is pre&s;ent with the whole creation; he knoweth our down-&s;itting and our up-ri&s;ing, he under|&s;tandeth our thoughts long before, he is about our path and about our bed, and &s;pieth out all our ways; if we climb up into Heaven, he is there, if we go down to hell, he is there al&s;o; no time or place, no action, word, or thought, are &s;o &s;ecret as to exclude him; the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the heart lye open to his view, and by the nece&s;&s;ary perfection of his nature he is intimately pre&s;ent with the minute&s;t particle of his works.</P>
<P>In regard of his gracious pre&s;ence, God is &s;aid to be pre&s;ent with good men, to dwell in their hearts, and to take up his re&s;idence with them that are of an humble and contrite &s;pirit; in regard of this, he
<PB N="67" REF="78">
draws near to us when we do any thing to plea&s;e him, and departs from us when we offend him.</P>
<P>In regard of his Maje&s;tick pre&s;ence, which we are to under&s;tand in the words under con&s;ideration, he is &s;aid to be in Heaven, becau&s;e he there affords brighter manife&s;tations of his glory; he from thence i&s;&s;ues out the decrees of his Providence, and lays open the purpo&s;e and de&s;ign of his di&s;pen&s;ations; he there &s;hines forth in that fullne&s;s of maje&s;ty, in that brightne&s;s of perfection, which we can but faintly ima|gine here, and the admiration of which will be part of our happy employment hereafter.</P>
<P>It remains for us to enquire, la&s;tly, For what purpo&s;es we are taught in our prayers to make mention of our Father's being in Heaven. The&s;e are to breed in us a pro|per notion of his all-perfect nature, to teach us that his ways are above our ways, and his thoughts above our thoughts as far
<PB N="68" REF="79">
as is the Heaven above the earth, to give us awful apprehen&s;ions of that Being who&s;e throne is in Heaven, and the earth is his foot&s;tool; to deter us from mea&s;uring the arm of Omnipotence by that of humanity, to compare the eternal God by mortal man, to in&s;truct us always to bear in mind the va&s;t difference between our earthly parents, and our Father which is in Heaven. This part of the prayer is mo&s;t admirably calcu|lated to in&s;pire us with the mo&s;t hearty and unfeigned &s;incerity, with the mo&s;t full and ab&s;olute reliance on God, with the mo&s;t thorough contempt of this, and ardent ex|pectation of another life.</P>
<P>One man cannot look into the heart of another, but mu&s;t be contented to judge by appearances; &s;o that a well conducted hypocri&s;y may gain a child as great ad|vantages from an earthly parent, as the mo&s;t unfeigned &s;incerity. But our Father which is in Heaven cannot be &s;o deceived, for the Lord &s;eeth not as man &s;eeth; man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="80">
Our earthly parents are &s;o un&s;table in their affections, &s;o weak in their under|&s;tanding, &s;o contracted in their abilities, &s;o &s;hort in their duration, that no certain dependance is to be had on them; but our Father which is in Heaven, is in his love and goodne&s;s fixt and immutable, in know|ledge infinite, in power almighty, in du|ration eternal, &s;o that on him, and him only we can place a &s;olid and rea&s;onable confidence.</P>
<P>There is nothing more proper than the con&s;ideration of our Father's being in Heaven to wean our affections from this world, and make us ga&s;p after the next; it reminds us of the &s;hortne&s;s and uncer|tainty of earthly things, where we have no continuing city, and that an inheritance is to be &s;ought by us in Heaven; for our Father is in Heaven, and where he is there &s;hould we de&s;ire to be al&s;o.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this di&s;cour&s;e with &s;um|ming up the full &s;en&s;e of the words we have been con&s;idering, according to the

When we con&s;ider thy infinite Maje&s;ty, Power, and Ju&s;tice, we are &s;truck with the mo&s;t pious

humility, reverence, and fear, are actuated with the mo&s;t firm re&s;olutions of obedience; when we contemplate thy goodne&s;s, wi&s;|dom, and knowledge, we feel the mo&s;t ex|alted &s;entiments of love and gratitude, &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion and re&s;ignation, confidence and &s;incerity; when we reflect on thy example we are in&s;pired with an univer&s;al love and charity for all men; when we con&s;ider that the Heavens are thy habitation, we look with indifference on things of this life, and de&s;ire to enjoy complete happine&s;s with thee in Heaven; and in order to en|&s;ure our&s;elves a place there, we make the&s;e affections the ruling principles of our lives and conver&s;ations; we always &s;et thy ex|ample before our eyes, and make, as chil|dren ought, the imitation of our Father's perfections the chief &s;tudy of our thoughts, the chief purport of our words, the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of our actions, the chief happine&s;s of our lives.</P>

<P>OUR Saviour having directed his di&s;|ciples to whom they were to offer their prayers, and by what name more e&s;pecially they &s;hould approach him, pro|ceeds to direct them likewi&s;e for what things they &s;hould pray to him, and in what order their petitions &s;hould be pre|&s;ented, beginning with, "Hallowed be thy Name." A petition which, as it naturally ari&s;es out of the words which went before, &s;o doth it very properly precede and obtain the preference over all that follow after.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="84">
When we receive any great and material ebligations from Man, when we are un|oxpectedly relieved from any great di&s;tre&s;s, or delivered from any impending danger, the fir&s;t motion of the &s;oul is all hurry and confu&s;ion, a mixture of pain and plea&s;ure rather to be felt than de&s;cribed. But when the&s;e fir&s;t tran&s;ports are over, when Rea&s;on re&s;umes her &s;eat, and Reflexion &s;ucceeds, the fir&s;t enquiry of a grateful &s;oul is this: I have received an obligation, how &s;hall I return it? If that appears impo&s;&s;ible, all that a generous benefactor will require, all that a grateful &s;oul can do, and more than &s;he can &s;ometimes expre&s;s, is to acknow|ledge her obligations, and to &s;ay, I thank thee.</P>
<P>Thus it is between us and God: when we have thoroughly weighed and examined the great and material benefits conferred on us by God, and &s;trongly conveyed to our minds, by the name of Father, when we view him at once as creating us out of the du&s;t of the earth, as pre&s;erving that
<PB N="75" REF="85">
being which he gave, and &s;afely conducting us through all the &s;torms of life, as re|deeming us from the claim of Hell, rege|nerating us by his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, and adopting us in his ble&s;&s;ed Son, all is joy, all is wonder, expre&s;&s;ing it&s;elf in the words of the P&s;almi&s;t, Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him, and the Son of man, that thou regarde&s;t him? Upon cooler recollection, gratitude induces us to think of making &s;ome return, and to cry out, What reward &s;hall I give unto the Lord for all the benefits he hath done unto me? What reward &s;halt thou give unto him in|deed! Thy intentions are good, but never to be executed. The mercies of God are as much above any returns of thine, as they are above thy de&s;erts. Thy Wealth is Poverty, thy Power Weakne&s;s, and thy Wi&s;dom Folly in the &s;ight of God. Pru|dently then, and piou&s;ly, content thy&s;elf with acknowledging his goodne&s;s, and &s;et|ting his mercies ever before thine eyes, with &s;aying, in the lively and grateful elo|quence of the P&s;almi&s;t, Prai&s;e the Lord,

O my &s;oul, and all that is within me prai&s;e his holy name; Prai&s;e the Lord, O my &s;oul, and forget not all his benefits; O God, our God, our Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy Name.</P>
<P>The order in which this petition &s;tands doth very properly point out to us what all of us mu&s;t know, and yet many of us are very apt, and too willing to forget, that the glory of God ought to be the great and chief pur&s;uit of man. It is apparent, that what&s;oever hath a right to our fir&s;t con&s;i|deration in our prayers, &s;hould have the &s;ame preference in our lives and conver&s;a|tions. Man may indeed, and too often doth divert and amu&s;e him&s;elf with vain and idle pur&s;uits, with wor&s;hipping idols of his own creation, and following phan|toms which he him&s;elf hath formed, but he can have no &s;olid and rational views, which have not a regard to, and do not ultimately terminate in, the glory of God; that mo&s;t noble and lively principle, that
<PB N="77" REF="87">
mo&s;t worthy and happy end of all his actions.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of God in the creation of the world was the glory of the Creator, and the good of the Creature; and then only doth the Creature attain to the utmo&s;t perfection of his nature, when both the&s;e ends are happily an&s;wered. But the mi&s;|fortune is, that the&s;e things, which in the de&s;ign of the Deity, and in the nature of things; are &s;trictly and in&s;eparably con|nected and united, become divided by the folly and corruption of man, and are con|&s;idered as incompatible, as two di&s;tinct and oppo&s;ite pur&s;uits, of which both are not attainable; and it is plain to be &s;een by the practice of the world, how much weight the glory of God will have with us, and how far it will influence our actions, when once it comes to be con&s;idered as incon|&s;i&s;tent with, and oppo&s;ite to, what we imagine to be our happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="88">
The greater part of mankind calling in|clination rea&s;on, and corruption happine&s;s, direct their cour&s;e to &s;ome di&s;tant goal, where imaginary happine&s;s takes up her abode; whil&s;t the wi&s;er and the happier few pur&s;ue the road which leads to the glory of God, and to the only true, &s;olid, and la&s;ting happine&s;s of man. Our wi&s;e Creator, well acquainted with the nature of the Creature which he had made, con|trived to implant in us a principle more quick and powerful to advance his glory than gratitude it&s;elf, when he made the &s;ame means which conduced to his glory, nece&s;&s;ary to our own happine&s;s; and that man who leads a religious and Chri&s;tian life, doth at the &s;ame time give glory to God, which is the one end of his creation, and procure happine&s;s to him&s;elf, which is the other.</P>
<P>Thus much ob&s;erved in general, I pro|ceed more particularly, to con&s;ider the petition before us, and &s;hall &s;hew,</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="89">
Fir&s;t, What we are to under&s;tand by God's Name. And,</P>
<P>Secondly, How we are to Hallow it.</P>
<P>By the Name of God we are to under|&s;tand, in the fir&s;t and mo&s;t important &s;en&s;e of the word, his all-perfect nature. Names are impo&s;ed on things to di&s;tingui&s;h them from each other, by conveying to us as clear an apprehen&s;ion as po&s;&s;ible of their nature. But God is a Being &s;o infinitely tran&s;cendent above all other, that no one name can give us any adequate conception of him, and the whole force of words is in&s;ufficient to &s;et before us God in that fullne&s;s of glory which dwells e&s;&s;entially in him. To rai&s;e our thoughts, however, as near as po&s;&s;ible to the Deity, he is in Scripture &s;et forth to us under &s;everal titles, expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;everal ways in which his all-perfect nature di&s;plays it&s;elf to man. Could any one word convey to us a proper notion of God's nature, that would be his name; but as this is impo&s;&s;ible, we mu&s;t
<PB N="80" REF="90">
by his name nece&s;&s;arily under&s;tand what|ever perfections we know to be e&s;&s;ential to him, whether manife&s;ted in his works, or revealed to us in his word, under how many different titles &s;oever.</P>
<P>By the name of God in a &s;econdary &s;en&s;e, we are to under&s;tand whatever hath an im|mediate relation to him; as the times and places &s;et apart for his &s;ervice, tho&s;e holy writings in which are contained the reve|lations of his will; the per&s;ons appointed to mini&s;ter in his &s;ervice, and the revenues allotted for their maintenance.</P>
<P>To hallow the name of God, in which &s;oever of the&s;e &s;en&s;es we take it, cannot &s;ignify to confer any holine&s;s upon it. In holine&s;s, as in his other adorable perfec|tions, God is infinite; nor is it in our power to dimini&s;h therefrom, or make any addition thereto; and tho&s;e things which bear &s;ome peculiar relation to God, are holy merely upon that account, and not according to the opinion which men may
<PB N="81" REF="91">
have, or the u&s;es they may make of them. It is not therefore for his own &s;ake, or any advantage, any fre&s;h increa&s;e of glory and holine&s;s accruing thereby to <HI>him,</HI> that God hath made the hallowing his name our duty, but for a proof of our love, gratitude, and obedience, and as a nece&s;&s;ary qualification to prepare us for being &s;ubjects of his kingdom. When therefore, we entertain high and worthy notions of God's nature; when we acknowledge his infinite perfec|tions, and act agreeably to &s;uch acknow|ledgments, viewing and adoring at a di&s;|tance his natural attributes, approaching to and imitating his moral, when we keep our mouths from profane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, and never mention the name of the high and holy One but with awe and reverence, piety and devotion; when we make God's glory the fir&s;t principle, the chief end of all our thoughts, words, and actions, and let the de&s;ire of hallowing his holy name &s;tand foremo&s;t in our hearts, as it doth in the petitions of this prayer, then
<PB N="82" REF="92">
do we hallow as we ought the name of God, as it &s;ignifies his nature.</P>
<P>When we e&s;teem tho&s;e things which bear any relation to God according to the dignity of him to whom they belong, and apply them to the purpo&s;es for which they were de&s;igned, when we rightly con&s;ider them as appointed by God to receive part of that reverence which we owe to him, and which he looks upon as paid to him|&s;elf, when we hallow the times and places &s;et apart for his &s;ervice by a con&s;tant at|tendance and devout behaviour; the Scrip|tures, by defending them on all occa&s;ions again&s;t the cavils and objections of infidels or evil-minded brethren, by e&s;teeming them the word of God containing all things ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, by diligently and de|voutly reading and meditating on them, and by giving them all honour in our con|ver&s;ation, forbearing to make a je&s;t of them, which is the practice of unbelievers, or to take a je&s;t out of them, which is the practice of many who gratify what they call wit
<PB N="83" REF="93">
at the expence of decency and religion, when we hallow the per&s;ons appointed to mini&s;ter in his &s;ervice by a proper regard of their function, a due attention to their in&s;tructions, and a practical ob&s;ervance of them, and their revenues by a cheerful and punctual payment of them whenever they are due, we do then hallow as we ought the name of God, according to the &s;e|condary explication here given of it.</P>
<P>Was it in our power to make any addi|tion to the Holine&s;s of God's Nature, or to add to his e&s;&s;ential Glory in any re&s;pect what&s;oever, certainly in point of gratitude we ought to do it, nay &s;hould be exceeding glad that we are able to make &s;ome return for the mercies we have received at his hands. As there is no plea&s;ure which is more &s;incere, no virtue which conveys greater delight along with it than the re|turning of obligations, unle&s;s it is the conferring them, what a delightful piece of &s;ervice mu&s;t it be to a generous &s;oul to indulge her gratitude to God, and in
<PB N="84" REF="94">
&s;ome mea&s;ure acquit her&s;elf of her obliga|tions, by hallowing his name. The &s;a|tisfaction ari&s;ing herefrom would be cheap|ly bought, though the performance was laborious and difficult; and the delight re&s;ulting from the action, when accom|pli&s;hed, would amply overpay all the la|bour undergone in the accompli&s;hment of it.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing then, that to hallow God's name was a laborious ta&s;k, whereas it is mo&s;t ea&s;y and plea&s;ant, and that it was pro|fitable to God, but not in the lea&s;t to our|&s;elves, gratitude &s;hould even then be &s;uffi|cient to induce us to perform it. Our &s;incere hallowing of God's name doth not render him one whit more holy, who is in him|&s;elf holy above all that is called holy; doth not render him in the lea&s;t more glorious, who is in him&s;elf great above all glory; our becoming faithful &s;ubjects of his king|dom doth not at all encrea&s;e his dominion, who in the right of his own e&s;&s;ential per|fections ruleth over all; nor our zealous
<PB N="85" REF="95">
performance of, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to, his will, make any addition to his authority who doeth what&s;oever he will in Heaven and in earth. It is for our own &s;akes therefore that we are taught thus to pray, and required thus to act; that by &s;o doing we may render our&s;elves proper objects of God's goodne&s;s, and partake of the ble&s;&s;ed effects of his beneficence.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, how few are there, if we look into the world, who are worthy repeaters of this petition, who hallow the name of God as they ought. Some, and tho&s;e not a few in this right honourable age of infidelity, wholly deny the Being of a God; others allow him in|deed a bare exi&s;tence, but impiou&s;ly &s;trip him of his attributes, and deny his Pro|vidence; whil&s;t many who profe&s;s the Chri&s;tian faith, and call them&s;elves the children of God, di&s;honour him by their wicked and profligate life, and bring into contempt, and cau&s;e to be evil &s;poken of, that holy name whereby they are called.</P>

All things &s;erious, &s;o|lemn, and &s;acred are wantonly thrown by, or treated only as proper &s;ubjects of ridi|cule; and the religion of Chri&s;t, which ought to warm the hearts and influence the practice of its profe&s;&s;ors, is no more than &s;kin-deep; it is made a plau&s;ible pre|tence to &s;erve a turn, and is put off and on as ea&s;ily as our cloaths. How thin is the church, how almo&s;t de&s;olate is the altar of God? What wonder? &s;ince a party of plea&s;ure, the dropping in of a friend, a too luxurious meal, an indolence of di&s;po&s;ition, in a word, any thing or nothing, is deemed a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for our &s;taying from church, and neglecting the publick wor&s;hip of our Maker.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WERE we but once thoroughly con|vinced of the exi&s;tence of a God, and of the great benefits which we have received at his hands, did we but con&s;ider, know, and acknowledge him to be our Father which is in Heaven, and &s;uffer &s;uch con&s;iderations to have their due weight and proper effect upon us, to incline us to re|verence his name, and render it holy and re&s;pectable among men, the next &s;tep would be our repeating as we ought, this Petition.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="102">
Thy Kingdom come. The great and ma|terial advantages of being under the imme|diate in&s;pection and government of an all|wi&s;e, powerful, ju&s;t and gracious King, are &s;o evident, that nothing but a dege|nerate and corrupted nature, nothing but a partial under&s;tanding blindly &s;ubmitting to the irregular dictates of a perver&s;e will could prevent our &s;eeing, acknowledging, pur&s;uing, and praying for them. Mo&s;t men, however, thus bia&s;&s;ed from their natural rectitude, &s;et up the throne of ex|travagant pa&s;&s;ions in their hearts, in&s;tead of chearfully and joyfully &s;ubmitting to the &s;ceptre of God; like the rebellious Jews, crying out for a King, when indeed the Lord their God was their King.</P>
<P>As this ari&s;es in a great mea&s;ure from a total ignorance of the nature of the King|dom here prayed for, I &s;hall &s;hew what we are to under&s;tand here by the Kingdom of God, and what we mean by the coming of that Kingdom; concluding with men|tioning
<PB N="93" REF="103">
tho&s;e affections with which this Petition ought always to be attended.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of God in Scripture is taken in &s;everal &s;en&s;es. Sometimes it means his natural or providential Kingdom, or that univer&s;al dominion which he exerci&s;es over all things, and which is the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of all his perfect nature.</P>
<P>In this &s;en&s;e holy David declares, thine, O Lord, is the greatne&s;s, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the maje&s;ty; for all that is in the Heaven, and in the Earth, is thine; thine is the Kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all.</P>
<P>Sometimes it means the Kingdom of grace, or the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P>This is called the Kingdom of God, be|cau&s;e though he doth not &s;et up an outward and vi&s;ible government, as in the Mo&s;aick di&s;pen&s;ation, yet he rules inwardly in the
<PB N="94" REF="104">
hearts and minds of tho&s;e who are entered into the Go&s;pel Covenant. This is the mo&s;t common acceptation of the phra&s;e in the New Te&s;tament. But it &s;ometimes &s;ignifies al&s;o the Kingdom of God's Glory, or that happy &s;tate into which at the day of Judgment, he &s;hall receive, and in which he &s;hall govern his &s;aints for ever.</P>
<P>Of this Kingdom our Saviour &s;peaks, &s;aying, then &s;hall the King &s;ay unto them on his right hand, Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;een in what general accep|tations the Kingdom of God is taken in Scripture, let us next con&s;ider in which of the&s;e it is to be under&s;tood in this petition.</P>
<P>As to the providential Kingdom of God, it is founded upon the perfection of his nature; and as that perfection is unalte|rably the &s;ame, &s;o mu&s;t the dominion re|&s;ulting from it be unalterable likewi&s;e, ca|pable
<PB N="95" REF="105">
neither of addition or diminution; and therefore we cannot here have any re|&s;pect to that kingdom.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Grace is capable of increa&s;e, both by the coming in of tho&s;e who do not now believe, and by &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed alteration in tho&s;e who do, that they may walk according to their profe&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Glory is capable of in|crea&s;e; both by receiving tho&s;e who do now, and &s;hall hereafter lead a godly life in the &s;tate of grace, and by admitting tho&s;e who are already departed out of this life in the fear of God, to a greater &s;hare of Glory, than they at pre&s;ent enjoy. In this petition therefore we have regard to the&s;e two kingdoms of grace and glory.</P>
<P>Though the kingdom of Grace is in fact but an introduction to that of Glory, and the kingdom of Glory the highe&s;t di&s;pen|&s;ation of God's grace, yet are they in &s;ome
<PB N="96" REF="106">
things different both as to the manner of the admini&s;tration, and the condition of the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In the kingdom of Grace we are in a &s;tate of tryal, liable to be drawn away by the deceit of the world, the fle&s;h, and the Devil, liable to pain and &s;orrow, to the fears of lo&s;ing what few comforts we en|joy, and to the trouble&s;ome certainty of leaving them if they leave not us; in the kingdom of Glory we are in a &s;tate of &s;e|cure and perfect felicity, our crown is fixt upon our heads too firm to be &s;haken, the flowers which bloom therein &s;hall always continue fre&s;h; Sin &s;hall be di&s;|armed of her &s;ting, and Death be &s;wallowed up in Victory.</P>
<P>In the kingdom of Grace, the good and the bad are mixed together, rewards and puni&s;hments are unequally di&s;tributed, and the worldly condition of the greate&s;t &s;inner is preferable to that of the mo&s;t righteous man on earth; but in the kingdom of
<PB N="97" REF="107">
Glory the good &s;hall be &s;eparated from the bad; tho&s;e who have been faithful &s;ervants of their Lord &s;hall be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the wicked and rebellious; the glorified Saint &s;hall no longer be the companion of the incorrigible Sinner; the latter &s;hall be a&s;&s;igned over to everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, and the former received into that glorious kingdom wherein is joy and peace for ever|more.</P>
<P>In the kingdom of Grace, we walk by Faith, we &s;ee through a gla&s;s darkly, our under&s;tanding is clouded, our rea&s;on weak, and our will perver&s;e; we are &s;carce able to comprehend the mo&s;t obvious things, and the ways of God, and the di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence, are far above out of our &s;ight; but in the kingdom of Glory we &s;hall &s;ee face to face, we &s;hall know even as we are known; all nature will be laid open to our view, and the God of Nature him&s;elf be fully manife&s;ted to us. The ways of Providence, which in many re|&s;pects appear to us dark, my&s;terious, and
<PB N="98" REF="108">
unintelligible, &s;hall be then cleared up, the cloud which &s;its upon them at pre&s;ent will be totally di&s;pelled, and they will ap|pear to us ju&s;t and uniform, worthy of the fountain of light from whence they i&s;&s;ued. The Nature of God, which in our pre&s;ent &s;tate we can have no adequate notion of, will then break forth upon us in its fulle&s;t tide of Glory, and the&s;e weak and frail bodies will be &s;o much &s;trengthned as to be able to &s;ee God and live; and our &s;ouls be &s;o far exalted above their pre&s;ent &s;tate in knowledge, as to be able fully to com|prehend, in purity, as to be able perfectly to enjoy the glorious object.</P>
<P>In the kingdom of Grace, upon account of our many &s;ins, and the utter impo&s;&s;i|bility of our making peace with God of our&s;elves, we are governed by our Me|diatour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; through the con&s;i|deration of who&s;e meritorious &s;ufferings and effectual interce&s;&s;ion, God overlooks our frailties, pardons our &s;ins, and accepts of a &s;incere repentance in&s;tead of a perfect
<PB N="99" REF="109">
obedience. But in the kingdom of Glory, when we &s;hall no more be liable to tempt|ation and &s;in, when our corruptible &s;hall have put on incorruption, and we bear the image of the heavenly, as we have born the image of the earthly, there will be no occa&s;ion for a mediatour, but we &s;hall be governed immediately by God him&s;elf; the mediatorial office of Chri&s;t &s;hall then cea&s;e, and the kingdom be delivered up to God even the Father, and the Son al&s;o him&s;elf &s;hall be &s;ubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</P>
<P>It remains for us to con&s;ider, in what &s;en&s;e we pray that the&s;e kingdoms of God may come.</P>
<P>For the kingdom of Grace we pray, that our hearts and minds may be thoroughly &s;ubdued thereto, that we may be worthy &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t's kingdom; that all per|&s;ons who are within the Chri&s;tian covenant may lead their lives an&s;werable thereto,
<PB N="100" REF="110">
and every member of Chri&s;t's holy church may in his vocation truly and godly &s;erve him; that God would plea&s;e to have mercy upon all Jews, Turks, Infidels, and Here|ticks, and take from them all ignorance, hardne&s;s of heart, and contempt of his word and commandment, and &s;o fetch them home to his flock, that they may be &s;aved among the remnant of the true I&s;|raelites, and be made one Fold under one Shepherd Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>
<P>For the kingdom of Glory we pray, that God will of his mercy &s;peedily relea&s;e us from the dangers and troubles of this life, and in&s;tate us with him&s;elf in joy and peace, that he will &s;hortly accompli&s;h the number of his elect, and receive his ble&s;&s;ed Saints into everla&s;ting happine&s;s.</P>
<P>To make us worthy repeaters of this petition, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould have a due &s;en&s;e of God's goodne&s;s in e&s;tabli&s;h|ing a kingdom among&s;t us, which is founded upon &s;uch mild and ea&s;y condi|tions

as that of Grace, and &s;trengthened with &s;uch great and glorious promi&s;es as that of Glory; we &s;hould acknowledge the great privilege of being under his government, who&s;e every action is dictated by infinite mercy, and guided by unerring wi&s;dom for the benefit of his creatures; we &s;hould entertain all tho&s;e affections for God which good &s;ubjects have for their kings, and perform all tho&s;e duties which they pay to them in as much greater a de|gree, as God is &s;uperior to the greate&s;t Monarch. We ought al&s;o, in u&s;ing this petition, to have an univer&s;al love and charity for all men, a due &s;en&s;e of the corruption of manners, of the prevalence of infidelity and vice, an holy &s;orrow for all who knowing the truth live not up to it, and for all who know it not, but walk in ignorance and in the &s;hadow of death. And the&s;e charitable affections &s;hould upon all occa&s;ions break forth into action, in|&s;piring us with a &s;incere zeal to in&s;truct the ignorant and reclaim the wicked.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="112">
A glorious employment this for a rea&s;on|able creature, and a nece&s;&s;ary qualification to make us true &s;ubjects of that kingdom which was founded and is governed by Chri&s;t, who &s;pent his whole life in doing good, in converting the Sinner from the evil of his ways, and bringing him to the knowledge of God. Chri&s;tianity was never intended to be kept in a corner, or confined, like the doctrines of the philo&s;ophers, to any particular &s;chool, but to &s;pread it&s;elf over the face of the whole earth. No one therefore can be a worthy &s;ubject of Chri&s;t's kingdom, who does not endeavour to ad|vance and propagate it.</P>
<P>It is not to be expected that we &s;hould, like the Apo&s;tles, vi&s;it remote and barba|rous nations, &s;ince we have not, as they had, the credentials of Miracles to pro|duce; but &s;urely it is our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to plant and propagate the Chri&s;tian religion in our own colonies, and as we reap their temporal things, to which we have I know not what right, to &s;ow in
<PB N="103" REF="113">
them &s;piritual things, to which our reli|gion entitles them, without any other con|&s;ideration. Had we been more careful to perform our parts in this re&s;pect, had we endeavoured to civilize tho&s;e rude nations, and in&s;til into them the principles of the Go&s;pel, we had not &s;o often lamented their virulent cruelty and repeated perfidies. Of late years indeed there has been e&s;tabli&s;hed among us a mo&s;t excellent charity for pro|pagating the Go&s;pel into foreign parts, and if the &s;ucce&s;s has not as yet an&s;wered our wi&s;hes, it has been &s;ufficient to quicken our endeavours.</P>
<P>It is evident from Scripture, that before the con&s;ummation of all things Chri&s;t's kingdom &s;hall be univer&s;al, that the earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the &s;ea, that the king|dom &s;hall be the Lord's, and he &s;hall go|vern the nations. It is our duty therefore to advance and ha&s;ten, to the utmo&s;t of our power, this happy aera, by approving our&s;elves true &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t, and &s;triving
<PB N="104" REF="114">
to erect his throne in the hearts of others; by endeavouring our&s;elves to promote Chri&s;tian knowledge at home, and encou|raging tho&s;e who &s;trive to propagate it abroad, admini&s;tring &s;uch means to them as may render their labours ea&s;y, and pave the way for their &s;ucce&s;s, &s;o that the word of God, and the kingdom of his Chri&s;t, may grow mightily and prevail.</P>
<P>It is our intere&s;t, as well as duty, to pray for the coming of Chri&s;t's kingdom, both in regard of the happy con&s;equences attending his univer&s;al dominion in the &s;tate of Grace, and our &s;peedier admi&s;&s;ion into that of Glory. Univer&s;al Happine&s;s mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of univer&s;al Chri&s;tianity, and the world &s;hall enjoy uninterrupted peace, when that religion which forbids all the motives to war, is &s;incerely pro|fe&s;&s;ed by all; the wolf &s;hall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard lie down with the kid, and the young lion and the fat|ling together, and a little child &s;hall lead them. All racking and malevolent pa&s;&s;ions

&s;hall then be extingui&s;hed, all ba&s;e and di&s;hone&s;t actions &s;hall then cea&s;e, and true religion &s;hall &s;anctify the hearts, pre&s;ide over the actions, and ble&s;s the lives of all men.</P>
<P>Thus univer&s;ally happy, thus univer&s;ally good &s;hall the &s;tate of Grace be, when the fullne&s;s of the Gentiles come in, and the remnant of I&s;rael is gathered together; and as the time of this great reformation is un|certain, as it may be even now at our doors, how much is it our duty, how much is it our intere&s;t to contribute every one of us his mite towards the ha&s;tening of this happy period.</P>
<P>And do thou, O God, who &s;ee&s;t how low religion is &s;unk, both in our minds and practice, be plea&s;ed to impart to us and to all people, &s;uch portions of thy grace as may purify our hearts, and amend our lives; as may incite us to the conver|&s;ion of others, as well as the reformation of our&s;elves; quicken our endeavours to

<P>THIS is the la&s;t of tho&s;e petitions which relate immediately to God, and is the be&s;t proof we can give of our being &s;incere in the foregoing.</P>
<P>The will of God may be under&s;tood either of tho&s;e laws which he has given us for the direction of our lives, or of tho&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations which in the cour&s;e of them he is plea&s;ed to lay on us.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="118">
In the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;en&s;es our &s;incere Obedience, in the la&s;t our chearful &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion is required. Both the&s;e duties I &s;hall con&s;ider in my pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ubjoin|ing &s;uch con&s;iderations as are proper to en|force them.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, Of obedience to the will of God, as it means the ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e laws which he has given us for the direc|tion of our lives.</P>
<P>The&s;e laws are contained in the holy &s;criptures; and as it is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould know the good, perfect, and ac|ceptable will of God, before it is po&s;&s;ible that we can do it, it is our duty to make our&s;elves thoroughly acquainted with the&s;e books, that we may have a competent knowledge of tho&s;e laws which are to be the &s;tandard of all our actions. In order to acquire this, we &s;hould be diligent in reading them our&s;elves, and attentive to &s;uch expo&s;itions as are delivered by others,
<PB N="109" REF="119">
for the more full and clearer illu&s;tration of them. Half the time which many of us be&s;tow upon reading Novels and Romances, would make us ma&s;ters of tho&s;e books wherein is contained our title to eternal &s;alvation.</P>
<P>One would imagine that a church like our's, wherein the Scriptures are publickly read in the vulgar tongue, and the duty of private reading and meditating on them is recommended, would abound with know|ledge and under&s;tanding, even among&s;t her poorer members; whereas on the contrary, many, even in con&s;iderable &s;tations, are &s;o gro&s;sly ignorant of them as can &s;carce be credited. For the knowledge of God's laws is not only ea&s;y to be acquired, but it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for us to be ac|quainted with them; as without knowing we cannot obey them, without obeying them we cannot obtain everla&s;ting &s;alva|tion. Let every per&s;on therefore make it his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;earch the Scriptures, to
<PB N="110" REF="120">
breed up his children in the knowledge of them, and to let their &s;tudies of things di|vine go hand in hand with their pur&s;uits after human knowledge; &s;o that we may every one of us attentively hear, con&s;tantly read, &s;eriou&s;ly mark, piou&s;ly learn, and profitably dige&s;t tho&s;e laws which God hath given us for the direction of our lives. The next thing to which is, that we act agreeably to that knowledge; if we know the will of God, happy are we if we do it.</P>
<P>The Obedience of the Angels is propo&s;ed to us by Chri&s;t as a pattern for our own, thy will be done in earth as it is in Heaven. Not that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, who knew the di&s;parity between them and us, and the many di&s;advantages which we labour under, that they are totally exempted from, de|mands from us that perfect performance of his will which they pay to him, and which we in our pre&s;ent &s;tate are incapable of di&s;charging. Great is the di&s;propor|tion
<PB N="111" REF="121">
between a glorified Spirit, free from the clog of fle&s;h, free from all tempta|tions, ble&s;t with an un&s;ullied clearne&s;s and rectitude of will, and a poor mortal crea|ture, encumbered with a load of matter, &s;urrounded with temptations, corrupt in his very nature, weak in his under&s;tanding, and in his will perver&s;e. Great therefore mu&s;t be the di&s;proportion in the &s;ervices which they pay to their Creator, in the purity and perfection of their obedience. But though we cannot equal the&s;e cele&s;tial beings, we may imitate them; though we cannot arrive at the excellency of their natures, we may by aiming at it arrive at the &s;ummit of our own. Sincerity and Univer&s;ality, Zeal and Alacrity, Diligence and Per&s;everance, con&s;picuous and in&s;epa|rable qualifications of their Obedience, may become ingredients of our own, though not in the &s;ame perfect degree; and every virtue which they in the excellency of the Angelick nature po&s;&s;e&s;s un&s;ullied, we in the infirmities of the human may imper|fectly
<PB N="112" REF="122">
imitate; and imitation is the thing propo&s;ed here, a practi&s;ing of the &s;ame virtues, though not in the &s;ame degree. A perfect and un&s;inning Obedience is not required of us, but a &s;incere and univer&s;al one is; which if we perform, the many acts of di&s;obedience which we commit through &s;urprize, ignorance, and infirmity, nay, through wilfulne&s;s it&s;elf, will upon a &s;incere repentance be graciou&s;ly pardoned by God, for his &s;ake who died for all men, and lives to make interce&s;&s;ion for all tho&s;e who do their be&s;t to approve them&s;elves his di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;een in what latitude our Obedience is expected, and in what man|ner God's will may be done in earth as it is in Heaven, I &s;hall now endeavour to enforce the practice of this Obedience to God's laws by &s;ome &s;uitable con&s;iderations. The fir&s;t of which is,</P>
<P>That, He, who made and delivered them to us, is a Being who has an indi&s;|putable
<PB N="113" REF="123">
authority to appoint laws, and in|finite power to puni&s;h tho&s;e who violate them. The be&s;t rules of action, unle&s;s enacted and enforced by proper authority, are weak and u&s;ele&s;s, in&s;ufficient to repre&s;s vice, and maintain virtue. Look into the &s;chools of the antient philo&s;ophers, and you will find that their many excellent na|tural precepts were confined within very narrow limits, and had little or no influ|ence, being generally more admired than practi&s;ed, even by their own &s;cholars. Rea&s;on was and ever will be too weak to combat with inclination, and Virtue, left to her&s;elf, unable to make a &s;tand again&s;t the corruptions of Vice. No law there|fore can be expected to be duly ob&s;erved, without an evident right of making it, a manife&s;t ability of puni&s;hing tho&s;e who break it, ve&s;ted in the law-giver. Both of which mo&s;t eminently concur in God; his right of giving laws to the Creatures whom he made is unque&s;tionable, his power of puni&s;hing the di&s;obedient is a nece&s;&s;ary perfection of his nature; he is wi&s;e in
<PB N="114" REF="124">
heart, and mighty in &s;trength; who hath hardened him&s;elf again&s;t him and pro&s;|pered? And his intention to puni&s;h them, as it might be fully proved from that perfect Ju&s;tice which is e&s;&s;ential to him, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Judgment are the ha|bitation of his throne, &s;o is it very plainly revealed in the &s;ame books wherein his laws are contained, that he will puni&s;h the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. All the motives therefore which &s;erve to enforce our obedience to the laws of man, do mo&s;t &s;trongly con&s;pire to bind on us Obedience to the laws of God.</P>
<P>Another motive to which duty is Grati|tude, ari&s;ing from a con&s;ideration of that per&s;on by who&s;e mediation God gave the&s;e laws to us, namely, Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If we reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on the mi&s;erable condi|tion from which Chri&s;t relieved us, and the means of Grace and hopes of Glory he hath afforded us, if we con&s;ider the means by which he effected this, how
<PB N="115" REF="125">
for our &s;akes he was incarnate, led a mean and inglorious life, and died a painful and ignominious death, we cannot acquit our|&s;elves of the ba&s;e&s;t ingratitude, if we trample on his authority, and refu&s;e Obe|dience to his laws. Generous tempers are willing, in many things, to bear with and oblige tho&s;e per&s;ons who have conferred favours on them, even in hard and unrea|&s;onable reque&s;ts. As the obligations there|fore which Chri&s;t has laid on us, are infi|nitely above any which man can confer, &s;o ought our gratitude to ri&s;e in proportion, and exert it&s;elf in a &s;teady Obedience, even if his laws were heavy and grievous to be borne; whereas on the contrary, his yoke is ea&s;y, and his burthen is light. And this &s;upplies us with another motive, drawn from the con&s;ideration of the laws them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Go&s;pel laws, if fairly and impar|tially con&s;idered, are undoubtedly the mo&s;t excellent in the world. God does not rule us in an arbitrary manner, and impo&s;e laws
<PB N="116" REF="126">
merely to demon&s;trate his authority, but governs us, as we are rea&s;onable creatures, in a rea&s;onable way. The laws which he has given us are adapted to the frame of our rea&s;on; and as creatures po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that faculty, we cannot help a&s;&s;enting to their equity, how much &s;oever we may neglect the performance of them; they carry full authority and conviction along with them, they &s;peak their original, and atte&s;t their author to be more than man.</P>
<P>Human laws are oftentimes perplext and ob&s;cure, cla&s;hing and incon&s;i&s;tent not only with rea&s;on, but with them&s;elves, liable to be mi&s;con&s;trued, perverted, and abu&s;ed; and the mo&s;t equitable of them are in a &s;tate of uncertainty, and &s;ubject to be re|pealed; but the laws of the Go&s;pel are free from all the&s;e imperfections; they are delivered in a clear, conci&s;e, and per&s;pi|cuous manner, and as they were de&s;igned for the direction of the ignorant, as well as of the learned, they lie level to the meane&s;t capacities, they are perfectly uni|form,
<PB N="117" REF="127">
con&s;i&s;tent, and harmonious, and the comments occa&s;ionally made on them by the Apo&s;tles &s;erve to reflect fuller light on them, and render the mo&s;t difficult pa&s;|&s;ages plain and ea&s;y; they are light it&s;elf, and in them is no darkne&s;s at all.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o fixt and immutable, liable to no change, &s;ubject to no repeal. The varying of circum&s;tances, the fallibility, &s;horti&s;ightedne&s;s, and want of integrity in human lawgivers, make it oftentimes ne|ce&s;&s;ary to vary their laws, but as God is free from all the&s;e blemi&s;hes, as there is in him no variablene&s;s nor &s;hadow of turn|ing, &s;o in the Go&s;pel laws which he has e&s;tabli&s;hed, there are no mi&s;takes, no in|firmities to require an alteration; they are a full, perfect, and perpetual &s;tandard of all our actions, to which all nations &s;hould bow and obey.</P>
<P>To the&s;e excellencies let us al&s;o join the &s;ublimity and u&s;efulne&s;s of the&s;e laws. In three &s;hort chapters of the New Te&s;ta|ment
<PB N="118" REF="128">
are contained more noble and &s;ublime doctrines, than the whole body of heathen philo&s;ophy can &s;upply us with; upon fir&s;t &s;ight indeed they appear &s;o ea&s;y and fa|miliar, that we may be induced to think, that we our&s;elves could have been the au|thors of them; but upon enquiry we &s;hall find, that the mo&s;t acute and diligent &s;pirits among the antients, after a whole life &s;pent in the &s;tudy of virtue, could, with all the advantages of human litera|ture, produce nothing which de&s;erved to be put in the &s;cale again&s;t Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy, indeed, whatever figure it might make before Chri&s;t appeared in the world, and his laws were promulged, did upon that promulgation very &s;en&s;ibly de|cline, and mu&s;t have entirely dropped to the ground long before it did, had not &s;ome profe&s;&s;ours of it, more artful than hone&s;t, tran&s;planted many of the Chri&s;tian precepts into their &s;y&s;tems, and embelli&s;hed them with virtues not their own.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="129">
To the foregoing motives to Obedience to the Go&s;pel laws, let us la&s;tly add, the u&s;efulne&s;s of them.</P>
<P>They are calculated to promote at the &s;ame time our virtue and happine&s;s, to make us at once better and happier men. They have a natural tendency to promote peace on earth and good will among men, as well as to advance the glory of God on high; they do not only pave our way to Heaven, but if religiou&s;ly obeyed, will make our life here an Heaven upon earth.</P>
<P>On the whole, the Go&s;pel laws are rea|&s;onable and ju&s;t, clear and conci&s;e, con|&s;i&s;tent and uniform, fixt and immutable, &s;ublime and u&s;eful; they are given by that God to whom our &s;ervice is due, through the mediation of that Saviour to whom we have the greate&s;t obligations, &s;o that in point of duty and rea&s;on, gratitude and in|tere&s;t, we are bound to perform a chearful, ready, and univer&s;al Obedience to the will of God, as it is manife&s;ted in tho&s;e laws
<PB N="120" REF="130">
contained in the Go&s;pel of his &s;on. Not|with&s;tanding which potent ties, we find it extremely difficult, and without the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of God's grace impo&s;&s;ible, to keep our&s;elves from falling; and therefore we are taught by our Saviour to pray to God that his will may be done in earth as in Heaven, to make us &s;en&s;ible that without his grace we cannot &s;o perform it, and even with it, in many things we offend all. How thankful therefore &s;hould we be to God, who has appointed a remedy for our weakne&s;s, and how joyful &s;hould we be to apply it, making up for the imperfection of our Obedience, by the &s;incerity of our Repentance. Such a cour&s;e will not only greatly redound to our temporal peace, but is al&s;o the only means, through Chri&s;t's blood, to entitle us to eternal glory; and the only way to become &s;harers of the hap|pine&s;s of Angels in Heaven, is to be &s;incere though imperfect imitators of their Obe|dience in earth.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="131">
I proceed now to con&s;ider the other duty included in doing God's will, namely, a patient and chearful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to whatever di&s;pen&s;ations God is plea&s;ed, in the cour&s;e of our lives, to lay upon us.</P>
<P>It is not in our power indeed to di&s;ap|point God's de&s;igns and rever&s;e his decrees, but it is in our power, and too often in our practice, to murmur and repine at them. By Submi&s;&s;ion therefore we are to under|&s;tand that virtue which enables us to ap|pear, in all &s;tations and under all circum|&s;tances, with an equal and re&s;igned tem|per, ari&s;ing from a full conviction that whatever happens unto us is according to God's appointment, and that whatever he appoints is always be&s;t. This is the only &s;olid foundation upon which our Submi&s;|&s;ion can be built; and Submi&s;&s;ion is that duty which of all others conduces to our ea&s;e and quiet, which conducts us with a &s;teady cour&s;e through all the &s;torms of life, which &s;oftens every &s;orrow, a&s;&s;wages every
<PB N="122" REF="132">
pain, and blunts the edge of the mo&s;t &s;e|vere misfortunes.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the &s;ufferings of human nature in general, and tho&s;e which we our&s;elves groan under in particular, the unequal di&s;tribution of them, &s;o that the lives of &s;ome men glide on in &s;erenity and peace, whil&s;t others know nothing but misfortunes from the cradle to the grave, and that oftentimes the righteous &s;uffer, and the wicked pro&s;per, upon &s;uch reflec|tions we are often tempted to call in que&s;|tion the Ju&s;tice of God, and cavil at his di&s;pen&s;ations; actuated by a principle of &s;elf-approbation, we are readier to con|demn any thing than our&s;elves, to impute our &s;ufferings to any rather than the true cau&s;e, to clear our&s;elves, and accu&s;e God. A practice this as unrea&s;onable as impious, greatly prejudicial to our own intere&s;ts, and injurious to his honour; in&s;tead of removing it augments our &s;ufferings, in|crea&s;es God's di&s;plea&s;ure, and in&s;pires all
<PB N="123" REF="133">
tho&s;e unea&s;y pa&s;&s;ions, and produces tho&s;e di&s;hone&s;t actions, which are the general con&s;equences of a di&s;contented mind. Sub|mi&s;&s;ion on the contrary, &s;uch a Submi&s;&s;ion as giveth thanks in all things, has not only a tendency in it&s;elf to alleviate our griefs, but al&s;o to prevail on God to remove them.</P>
<P>However dark and my&s;terious, unintel|ligible and incon&s;i&s;tent the ways of Provi|dence may appear, this patient and re&s;igned temper receives and &s;uffers all things with|out repining; and is firmly per&s;uaded, that in a future &s;tate all which &s;eems dark and my&s;terious in God's government &s;hall be cleared up, all that &s;eems unintelligible &s;hall be thoroughly explained, and all which &s;eems incon&s;i&s;tent &s;hall be fully re|conciled; &s;o that however we may repine at our &s;ufferings here, we &s;hall &s;ee the ju&s;|tice and good tendency of them hereafter. It is indeed impo&s;&s;ible for us to &s;uffer and not to feel, what is required of us is to feel like men, and bear like Chri&s;tians; neither are our endeavours to extricate our&s;elves,
<PB N="124" REF="134">
or our prayers that God would deliver us, any ways oppo&s;ite to this duty, but are them&s;elves duties which ought always to accompany our &s;ufferings as we are rea&s;on|able creatures, and as we are Chri&s;tians; only let us u&s;e no endeavours but &s;uch as are &s;trictly ju&s;t, no prayers but what are offered up with that re&s;ignation of which Chri&s;t has &s;et us an example; we may be|&s;eech God, that the cup may pa&s;s from us, but always with this conclu&s;ion, not my will, O Lord, but thy will be done. This is a temper which every man ought always to carry about with him, and yet it is a point in which the very be&s;t of us are apt to fall &s;hort; I &s;hall therefore conclude this di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ubjoining &s;ome of the many motives which might be offered for the enforcement of this duty.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, let us con&s;ider the per&s;on who brings the&s;e &s;ufferings upon us; it is God; a Being of who&s;e nature we can have no true notion, without acknowledging him
<PB N="125" REF="135">
endued with Almighty Power, perfect Goodne&s;s, and con&s;ummate Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the fir&s;t of the&s;e at|tributes he rules and governs all things, brings to pa&s;s what&s;oever he &s;ees fit, and &s;uffers no oppo&s;ition nor controul, he is mighty in &s;trength, who hath hardened him&s;elf again&s;t him and pro&s;pered? And if God, who brings the&s;e &s;ufferings upon us, is of &s;uch infinite power, how im|prudent is it in us to murmur and repine at what we can no ways prevent, how un&s;afe to provoke a power, which we are utterly incapable of re&s;i&s;ting? This argu|ment, however &s;trong when applied to our weakne&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity is, it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, but little calculated to engage and work upon the heart; it demands our &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion through fear, but not through love; it does not at all induce us to ki&s;s the rod, and ble&s;s the hand which gives the blow. To the perfect goodne&s;s of God we mu&s;t have recour&s;e, before we can be thoroughly reconciled to, and &s;atisfied with,
<PB N="126" REF="136">
our &s;ufferings; we may &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of them from his power, but are convinced of the u&s;efulne&s;s and advantage of them by his goodne&s;s only. It is this attribute which gives us patience, re&s;ignation, and love, for it is this which teaches us that God cannot take delight in the mi&s;eries of his creatures, that he does not grieve us willingly, but in mercy, and that his di&s;pen&s;ations, however &s;evere they may fall, are indeed the re&s;ult of an Almighty Power, but of an Almighty Power acting according to the dictates of perfect good|ne&s;s, and under the direction of unerring wi&s;dom. God is of infinite knowledge and wi&s;dom, he perfectly under&s;tands the nature of all things, with their qualities, powers, and circum&s;tances; he thoroughly comprehends the re&s;pects and relations of things one to another, the fitne&s;s of &s;uch and &s;uch means to produce &s;uch and &s;uch ends, and therefore, as his goodne&s;s always inclines and his power always enables him to act for the good of his creatures, &s;o his
<PB N="127" REF="137">
wi&s;dom &s;ecures him from any errour and mi&s;application.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations mu&s;t naturally tend to &s;uppre&s;s our complaints and confirm our patience; for as God is of infinite wi&s;|dom, goodne&s;s, and power, nothing can cloud his under&s;tanding, nothing can per|vert or re&s;i&s;t his will; and therefore in this we may re&s;t &s;atisfied, that God always knows what is for our good, and is always willing and able to afford it to us; and therefore we may with the greate&s;t &s;ecu|rity repo&s;e our&s;elves in him.</P>
<P>Another motive to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion ari&s;es from a con&s;ideration of our&s;elves.</P>
<P>We are God's creatures, and ought to be very thankful, that we are at all, and not to murmur that we are in no better condition. Shall the lump of Clay &s;ay to the Potter who fa&s;hioned it, why ha&s;t thou made me thus or thus? Our condition here was not de&s;igned to be completely
<PB N="128" REF="138">
happy, but to be intermixed with tryals, and troubles; we are in a &s;tate of proba|tion, not of felicity. Sufferings are the nece&s;&s;ary lot of our nature; Our Saviour was made perfect by them; and as we ought to follow him in other re&s;pects, &s;o mu&s;t we expect to follow him in this al&s;o. Why &s;hould we repine then at the com|mon burthen of our nature, why murmur at the ju&s;t and &s;alutary di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence? e&s;pecially con&s;idering that we are &s;inners, and as &s;uch, the very lea&s;t of God's mercies is more than we de&s;erve, the very &s;evere&s;t of his inflictions is milder than our crimes in &s;trict ju&s;tice demand; why then doth a living man complain, a man for the puni&s;hment of his &s;ins?</P>
<P>La&s;tly, let us con&s;ider the nature of the &s;ufferings them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Great part of tho&s;e afflictions which we place to God's account, ought in good rea|&s;on to be placed to our own. How many are poor through extravagance or indo|lence,
<PB N="129" REF="139">
how many &s;ick through debauchery and intemperance; and &s;o with many other afflictions, which being withdrawn from tho&s;e mi&s;eries we &s;o much complain of, would reduce them more than at fir&s;t view we could believe; and for tho&s;e which re|mained, they would not appear &s;o terrible as at pre&s;ent, if we would place the good which we unde&s;ervedly enjoy, again&s;t the ills which we de&s;ervedly feel; if we would con&s;ider how many per&s;ons were in a wor&s;e &s;tate, rather than ca&s;t up our eyes to tho&s;e who are in a better; if we would reflect on the quick and &s;udden tran&s;itions which we &s;ee from affliction to comfort, even in tho&s;e who &s;eem the farthe&s;t gone in mi&s;ery; and that even in the mid&s;t of our &s;ufferings we may have the &s;trong con&s;olation of hope; we may bear the pre&s;ent in expec|tation of the future, and not unrea&s;onably believe, that as we ebb with the one tide, we &s;hall flow with the other. But &s;up|po&s;ing that our &s;ufferings were as con&s;tant as they are &s;evere, that they were as con|&s;iderable in number as degree, and that
<PB N="130" REF="140">
we were a&s;&s;ured they would continue as long as our lives, yet even in this de|plorable condition we may with plea&s;ure reflect, that the man that is born of a woman is of few days, &s;o that our misfor|tunes will &s;oon have an end; we may tri|umphantly con&s;ider, that our momentary afflictions will work for us an eternal and far more exceeding weight of glory.</P>
<P>On the whole therefore, &s;ince trouble &s;pringeth not out of the ground, but is &s;ent and directed by an all-gracious, wi&s;e, and powerful God, &s;ince afflictions are the common burthen of our nature, and the very &s;evere&s;t of them are not the adequate wages of our crimes, &s;ince they are gene|rally more than counterpoi&s;ed with ble&s;&s;|ings, are to be endured but a &s;hort time, and will if properly borne turn to a good account, for the&s;e &s;everal rea&s;ons, if thou come to &s;erve the Lord, prepare thy &s;oul for temptation. Set thy heart, and con|&s;tantly endure and make not ha&s;te in time of trouble. Cleave unto him and depart
<PB N="131" REF="141">
not away, that thou may'&s;t be encrea&s;ed at thy latter end. What&s;oever is brought upon thee take chearfully, and be patient when thou art changed to a low e&s;tate; that &s;o &s;uffering according to the will of God, we may commit the keeping of our &s;ouls to him in well-doing, as unto a faith|ful Creator.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MATTHEW vi. 11th.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Give us this day our daily Bread.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is the only petition in the Lord's Prayer, which immediately relates to our temporal pro&s;perity, and the obtain|ing of &s;uch things as are nece&s;&s;ary to our Being and well-being in this life. Many of the primitive Chri&s;tians were of opinion, that the Bread which our Lord here teaches us to pray for, was not to be under&s;tood of any good things relating to the body, but of the Euchari&s;tical Bread in the Lord's Supper, and of the &s;piritual &s;u&s;tenance thereby conveyed to the &s;oul by the increa&s;e of grace; and hence aro&s;e the cu&s;tom of
<PB N="134" REF="143">
receiving that &s;acrament every day. The error of this opinion hower is &s;ufficiently evident, from a con&s;ideration of the time wherein our Saviour taught his di&s;ciples this prayer, and the time wherein he in&s;ti|tuted the &s;acrament, the one in the very infancy of his mini&s;try, the other, not till the eve of his crucifixion; &s;o that during that interval, the Apo&s;tles, and all who made u&s;e of this prayer, mu&s;t, in repeat|ing this petition for their daily bread, have petitioned for they knew not what, and prayed without any effect upon the under|&s;tanding and heart; a thing not &s;uppo&s;able in any, much le&s;s in &s;uch a ma&s;ter as Chri&s;t; who&s;e doctrines are all calculated for the edification of his di&s;ciples, and who cannot therefore be thought to have in|&s;erted in a form of prayer compo&s;ed for their u&s;e, a petition which, for &s;ome length of time, could not po&s;&s;ibly be of any u&s;e to them at all.</P>
<P>In&s;tead therefore of perplexing our&s;elves with vain &s;uppo&s;itions, I &s;hall embrace
<PB N="135" REF="144">
that plain and ea&s;y meaning, which is mo&s;t free from all objections, and was mo&s;t pro|bably intended by our Lord, and received by his di&s;ciples; namely, that by Bread here we are to under&s;tand all the nece&s;&s;a|ries, conveniencies, and comforts of this life, all that may be nece&s;&s;ary for our &s;up|port, and conduce to our refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>Bread being the chief &s;upport of life, is, by a figure very common with all, but more e&s;pecially with the Scripture writers, &s;et to denote all the other various things requi&s;ite for that purpo&s;e. By daily Bread here prayed for we are to under&s;tand &s;uch a portion of tho&s;e good things as may be &s;ufficient for the day being, which, con|&s;idering the weakne&s;s and mortality of our nature, is a great, nay and a greater con|tinuance, than we can with certainty pro|mi&s;e our&s;elves in this life. But though the term of our life may po&s;&s;ibly extend no farther than the pre&s;ent day, yet as it may, for any thing that we can tell, be lengthened out to many years, we are
<PB N="136" REF="145">
therefore taught to pray that this Bread may be given us this day, or, as &s;aint Luke has it, day by day, a phra&s;e, according to Hebrew writers, &s;ignifying the whole term of our lives, that God would during our Being here, be it longer or &s;horter, &s;up|ply us with &s;uch things as are nece&s;&s;ary for our well being here, in &s;uch a manner, and in &s;uch proportions as he &s;hall &s;ee mo&s;t conducive to our real benefit. This is the true purport of the petition, and though &s;piritual good things are of the greate&s;t moment, and con&s;equently demand our chief concern, yet, let zeal without know|ledge pretend what it will, temporal good things demand, and indeed de&s;erve our rea&s;onable attention. It is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that we &s;hould pray to the Author of our being for &s;uch things as are nece&s;|&s;ary to pre&s;erve it, for &s;uch things as rea|&s;on and &s;cripture make it our duty to &s;eek, and which yet without his concurrence we &s;hould &s;eek in vain; that we &s;hould pray in the words of our Lord, according to the &s;en&s;e now given of them, for our daily

bread, and in the language of our church, a&s;k tho&s;e things which are requi&s;ite and ne|ce&s;&s;ary, as well for the body as the &s;oul.</P>
<P>This petition is calculated to breed in us a thorough per&s;ua&s;ion of, and dependance upon the providence of God in general, and particularly as it relates to the &s;upply of our wants. It naturally implies to us, that the &s;ame God which at fir&s;t created, &s;till governs and pre&s;erves the world, that no per&s;ons are exempted from his juri&s;|diction, that the mo&s;t minute occurrences of life are at his di&s;po&s;al, that without his ble&s;&s;ing all our labours are ineffectual, and the wi&s;e&s;t, mo&s;t indu&s;trious, and careful man on earth, is not able without his con|currence to acquire even his daily bread. This is a le&s;&s;on, which many who are wi&s;e in their own conceits find it difficult to learn; exalted in dignity and power, great in human knowledge and worldly wi&s;dom, they imagine every thing to be within their own reach, there is nothing which they cannot do them&s;elves of them&s;elves, and
<PB N="138" REF="147">
therefore it is unnece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to a Providence, and apply for the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of foreign aid, when their own forces are &s;o amply &s;ufficient to accompli&s;h all their de&s;ires.</P>
<P>It is this vain and pre&s;umptuous way of thinking, which leads men into number|le&s;s mi&s;carriages, which induces them to de&s;pi&s;e the u&s;eful a&s;&s;i&s;tances of men, and to reject their nece&s;&s;ary dependance upon God, which renders them at length (when they experimentally find the vanity of hu|man wi&s;dom and the weakne&s;s of human &s;trength) the contempt of the greater part of mankind, and the pity of the wi&s;er few, who will happily learn from their error and di&s;appointment, to tru&s;t in the Lord with all their heart, and not to lean on their own under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>If we look into our&s;elves with an im|partial eye, we &s;hall ea&s;ily di&s;cern the num|berle&s;s things which we &s;tand in need of in this world, and at the &s;ame glance &s;ee
<PB N="139" REF="148">
the impo&s;&s;ibility of our acquiring them of our&s;elves; and &s;uch per&s;ons, as &s;eem the farthe&s;t removed from the&s;e wants, who are ble&s;t with the greate&s;t affluence, will find abundant rea&s;on, when they con&s;ider the uncertainty of human affairs, to di&s;tru&s;t their own pro&s;perous condition, and ap|ply to Providence, who was the fir&s;t giver, to be the continuer al&s;o of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, which are in them&s;elves &s;o uncertain, and always upon the wing. Man indeed, upon a fair review of him&s;elf, of his wants and weakne&s;s, ought to e&s;teem it his greate&s;t happine&s;s, that there is a re&s;ource above to which he may always betake him&s;elf, that there is an overruling Providence in whom are centered infinite power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s, which are continually di&s;playing them&s;elves in the mo&s;t perfect harmony, and graciou&s;ly co-operating for his good. Left to our&s;elves, what mi&s;erable creatures &s;hould we be? but happily for us we have a &s;upport much better than our&s;elves, and where man fails, God &s;trengthens and &s;up|ports. Happy are we, would we but be
<PB N="140" REF="149">
wi&s;e enough to know, and humble enough to acknowledge it, in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an almighty power, the direction of an all-comprehending wi&s;dom, the liberality of an all-&s;u&s;taining goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Here then is thy &s;tay O man, here is thy only &s;olid dependance. Throw off tho&s;e vain and deceitful dependances which ari&s;e from things tran&s;itory, repo&s;e thy&s;elf upon thy Maker, and get thee to thy God right humbly. To him apply who is always ready to hear, and able to relieve thee; on him depend, who will not, who cannot deceive thee. Whether thou do&s;t petition for the obtaining of what thou wante&s;t, or the continuance of what thou ha&s;t, for things of greater or le&s;s con&s;equence, whe|ther matters of conveniency and comfort are the &s;ubjects of thy prayers, or in the humility of thine heart thou a&s;ke&s;t only for thy daily Bread literally under&s;tood, be a&s;|&s;ured that if you pray as you ought, you &s;hall obtain what you pray for, if it is really for your good.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="150">
And this leads me to con&s;ider, which I &s;hall make the remaining bu&s;ine&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e, what qualifications are requi&s;ite to &s;anctify our offering up of this petition, to render it acceptable in the &s;ight of God, and procure an happy return to it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing nece&s;&s;ary towards pro|curing what we want, is a proper u&s;e of what we have; and this petition doth na|turally warn us again&s;t the dangerous ex|tremes of extravagance and avarice, and recommends to us that liberality on the one hand, which in oppo&s;ition to avarice, enables us to enjoy what we have, and that frugality on the other, which in op|po&s;ition to extravagance, &s;erves to render our enjoyments la&s;ting. Vain and pre&s;ump|tuous is it for man to expect that the li|beral hand of Providence will continue to &s;hower down ble&s;&s;ings upon him, which he ungratefully makes a bad u&s;e of, or not le&s;s ungratefully makes no u&s;e at all. In|&s;tances there are, and not a few in the world, of men, who &s;eem to think that
<PB N="142" REF="151">
Providence is employed entirely for them, and that the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of the gene|ral &s;upporter of mankind is a particular attention to, and a con&s;tant readine&s;s to furni&s;h them with materials to gratify their mo&s;t irregular inclinations, and &s;upport them in their extravagancies; whil&s;t others not le&s;s mi&s;taken, e&s;teem them&s;elves mo&s;t ju&s;tly entitled to the favours of Provi|dence, becau&s;e they with great good oeco|nomy make no u&s;e of them at all; have neither the heart to enjoy their riches them&s;elves, nor to communicate them to others. The truth indeed is this; both the&s;e extremes are bad, both di&s;qualify us from being worthy repeaters of this peti|tion, and cut off tho&s;e hopes which we otherwi&s;e might rea&s;onably entertain of of|fering it up with &s;ucce&s;s. The extravagant man is guilty of pre&s;umption, in daring to depend upon a continuance of tho&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings which he continually abu&s;es; and the covetous man, whil&s;t he is fearful of u&s;ing what he hath lea&s;t he &s;hould come to want, is guilty of that di&s;tru&s;t in Provi|dence,
<PB N="143" REF="152">
which is contrary to the de&s;ign, and de&s;tructive of the foundation of this petition. In a word, tho&s;e who &s;hew them&s;elves unworthy of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing what they have, &s;hew them&s;elves unworthy al&s;o of obtaining what they a&s;k.</P>
<P>The next thing nece&s;&s;ary to render this petition &s;ucce&s;sful, is moderation in our re|que&s;ts. A great privilege it is, a real ble&s;&s;ing, that God commands us to offer up, and promi&s;es to receive, our prayers; but great and ungrateful in&s;olence &s;urely it is in us, if we abu&s;e that privilege, if we pre&s;ume upon that promi&s;e &s;o far as to a&s;k more than God hath given us warrant to expect. Though the goodne&s;s of the divine nature is &s;uch, that he is willing to overlook our infirmities, and put our &s;ins far from us, though he hath graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed to li&s;ten to our petitions, and grant our reque&s;ts, yet this promi&s;e is made to us not ab&s;olutely, but &s;till at the di&s;|cretion of his perfect wi&s;dom; and greatly indeed is it to be feared, that if men were
<PB N="144" REF="153">
certainly to obtain what they prayed for, the efficacy of prayer would by the folly of man be turned into a cur&s;e, in&s;tead of proving a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Would men rightly con&s;ider, whereas indeed great numbers of them never con|&s;ider at all, they would ea&s;ily &s;ee that prayer was never de&s;igned as a means of gratifying ambition, avarice, or &s;en&s;uality; but of obtaining tho&s;e real nece&s;&s;aries, tho&s;e material conveniencies, tho&s;e &s;olid com|forts, from an all-&s;u&s;taining Providence, which nature requires, and could not be happy without. The real wants, nay, and the rea&s;onable comforts of man lye within a very &s;mall compa&s;s. Hurried on by mad pa&s;&s;ions indeed, and forming va&s;t and vi&s;ionary &s;chemes, we multiply, we aggravate our wants, and of one real create a thou&s;and imaginary nece&s;&s;ities; whereas Nature in her&s;elf, that is, Nature &s;upported and directed by Rea&s;on, is contented with a little, and doth not require a great deal to give her that happine&s;s which &s;he is ca|pable
<PB N="145" REF="154">
of in her pre&s;ent &s;tate. We deceive our&s;elves therefore, if we imagine that this petition gives us an unbounded right of a&s;king, in the extravagance of our hearts, for the delicacies and &s;uperfluities of life; all that our Saviour warrants is our peti|tioning for the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of it; for our daily bread, and that from day to day.</P>
<P>But after all, after we have worked our|&s;elves up to a proper pitch of confidence in the Providence of God, made a proper u&s;e of tho&s;e good things which he hath already ble&s;t us with, and regulated our de&s;ires for what we pray according to the dictates of rea&s;on, &s;till there remains &s;ome|thing farther to be done; and an hone&s;t indu&s;try is required on our parts to make us worthy of God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>From &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in Scripture, mi&s;|under&s;tood and wretchedly perverted, ex|plained in a manner contrary to rea&s;on, and contrary to other expre&s;s pa&s;&s;ages in
<PB N="146" REF="155">
Scripture which can never be mi&s;under|&s;tood, there have not been wanting, and perhaps never will be wanting, men who would willingly talk indu&s;try out of the world, and call lazine&s;s and indolence de|pendance upon Providence; who, truly en|thu&s;ia&s;t like, pretending to &s;eek the king|dom of God, pre&s;ume that all the&s;e things &s;hall be added unto them, without any care, any trouble on their &s;ide. How contrary is this to rea&s;on, to the circum&s;tances of the world, to the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity? The Scriptures do no where countenance a &s;upine throwing our&s;elves upon Provi|dence, without any farther concern for our&s;elves. We have no right to expect a miraculous interpo&s;ition in our behalf, to hope that we &s;hall be fed, as the I&s;raelites, with food from Heaven, or think that our lands, like Gideon's fleece, &s;hall be well|watered, whil&s;t all around us are dry and barren. The&s;e are particular vouch&s;afe|ments of Providence, and not to be ex|pected by us; but when we do the be&s;t we can, when we acquit our&s;elves like dili|gent,
<PB N="147" REF="156">
indu&s;trious and provident men, then may we pray to God to crown our labours with &s;ucce&s;s, then may we depend upon him for our daily bread, and live &s;ecurely under his care and protection, without perplexing our&s;elves with vain fears; and all fears are vain, when we have &s;ecured our&s;elves an intere&s;t in the mo&s;t high, who is always willing, always able to &s;upply our wants.</P>
<P>To crown the re&s;t, let us la&s;tly add Charity. Sen&s;ible of our own wants, let us con&s;ider our brethren; and whil&s;t we in this petition acknowledge our depend|ance upon Providence, let us in a more ac|ceptable manner acknowledge it, by &s;hew|ing our regard to his creatures. All that we have, all that we hope for, we here refer to God, and ought in good rea&s;on to be&s;tow &s;ome part of it in the manner which he hath appointed; to deal out our bread to the hungry, and to con&s;ider the cau&s;e of the poor; to be merciful to our brethren
<PB N="148" REF="157">
in proportion as God has been favourable to us.</P>
<P>There is no one duty which is &s;o highly extolled in Scripture, and hath &s;o many powerful motives to enforce it, as Charity; and if we expect the continuance of the ble&s;&s;ings of Providence, the be&s;t way to en&s;ure them is to be merciful as our Father is merciful.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood to mean (making that a general which was only a particular precept) that it is the duty of every rich man to &s;ell all, and give to the poor, much le&s;s, according to the maxims of our in&s;pired preachers, that it is the duty of the poor to &s;ell all, and give to the rich; &s;o far from it, that it is every man's duty to provide for his family, and Chri&s;ti|anity doth not de&s;troy, but confirms the law of nature, and the rules of prudence. What is required of us is, not to deceive our&s;elves, by fancying our nece&s;&s;ities greater and our abilities le&s;s than they really are,
<PB N="149" REF="158">
but to follow at once the dictates of Pru|dence and Charity, not giving away &s;o much as to expo&s;e our&s;elves to future want, nor yet di&s;tributing &s;o little, as to be un|worthy petitioners to Providence, for the &s;upply of our own nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;een the nature and extent of this petition, with the qualifications re|qui&s;ite to make our repeating of it accept|able to God, I &s;hall, according to the man|ner I have hitherto ob&s;erved, conclude this di&s;cour&s;e by &s;umming up the whole in the form of a prayer.</P>
<P>O thou all-gracious, all-&s;u&s;taining Pro|vidence, by who&s;e goodne&s;s we were cre|ated, and by who&s;e goodne&s;s we have hi|therto been pre&s;erved, continue to us thy favour and protection; give us &s;uch a ju&s;t knowledge both of thee, and of our&s;elves, that we may be thoroughly &s;en&s;ible we are thy dependants, that we are indebted to thee for all we have, and mu&s;t apply to thee for all we want. Grant, O Lord,
<PB N="150" REF="159">
that we may &s;o live in this world, as men that mu&s;t leave it at one time or other, that may continue perhaps for a few years, or may be taken off this very moment; make us &s;en&s;ible how few our real wants are, and let not our de&s;ires go beyond them. Let thy mercies crown our indu&s;trious endea|vours with &s;ucce&s;s, and a well timed &s;ea&s;on|able Charity, &s;anctify our works, and give &s;trength to our prayers.

<Q><HI>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the&s;e words are two things ob&s;erv|able;&mdash;the Petition&mdash;forgive us our debts,&mdash;and the condition on which we a&s;k forgivene&s;s&mdash;as we forgive our debt|ors. Both the&s;e are &s;ubjects that greatly de&s;erve our con&s;ideration&mdash;the one as it affords the highe&s;t in&s;tance of God's good|ne&s;s to the &s;ons of men, the other as con|taining a motive to the forgivene&s;s of our enemies, which is one of the harde&s;t of all Chri&s;tian duties. I &s;hall therefore particu|larly con&s;ider them, and &s;hall &s;hew that the
<PB N="152" REF="161">
mercy and goodne&s;s of God, is remarkably di&s;played, by the permi&s;&s;ion here given us to pray to him, for the forgivene&s;s of our &s;ins.</P>
<P>The temporal ble&s;&s;ings which his Pro|vidence di&s;pen&s;es for the &s;upply of our wants, are arguments indeed of great goodne&s;s to us, and de&s;erve our highe&s;t gratitude and love. But the&s;e are concerns of &s;mall moment to us, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e which look beyond the grave, and yield a pro&s;pect of better things to come. For what would it avail us to be &s;upplied by his bounty with the nece&s;&s;aries of this pre&s;ent life, if our &s;ins were to follow us in the next? If the &s;ins and offences of our youth and old age were regi&s;tered and trea&s;ured up again&s;t us, if no act of obli|vion was to pa&s;s on our actions, no pardon granted, no method of atonement appoint|ed to blot out our &s;ins, no a&s;&s;urance that our prayers &s;hall be heard, no direction to a&s;k that our debts may be forgiven as we forgive our debtors, we &s;hould as the
<PB N="153" REF="162">
Apo&s;tle &s;ays, all have been concluded un|der &s;in, and con&s;equently under puni&s;h|ment; our condemnation had been &s;ure, our &s;entence irrever&s;ible, and the ble&s;&s;ings and conveniencies we at pre&s;ent enjoy, would only have &s;erved to make ea&s;y our pa&s;&s;age to a &s;tate of everla&s;ting mi&s;ery; and who could be &s;o fond of a &s;hort momen|tary life, as to value it upon &s;uch terms as the&s;e? It is the glorious pro&s;pect we have before us, the certainty that if we are not wanting to our&s;elves we may work out our own &s;alvation, and obtain by the &s;atisfac|tion of our Saviour, what we were not able to &s;ecure for our&s;elves; the means of forgivene&s;s are placed in our own hands, and therefore it will be our own faults if we mi&s;carry. And when we con&s;ider the wretched &s;tate we were in before Chri&s;t undertook our ran&s;om, the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning, the certainty of our puni&s;hment, and how little rea&s;on there was for God to accept of a &s;atisfaction and reconcile us to him&s;elf, we cannot but e&s;teem it a won|derful in&s;tance of God's goodne&s;s that he
<PB N="154" REF="163">
was plea&s;ed to provide a remedy, and point out a method by which Mercy might take place, and yet Ju&s;tice be fully &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>The u&s;e therefore that we ought to make of this amazing goodne&s;s, is fir&s;t to reflect with gratitude, to acknowledge the &s;en&s;e we have of our unworthine&s;s to re|ceive it, and the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of our obtaining mercy without the free grace of God.</P>
<P>As there was nothing in our power to influence God to &s;hew us mercy, as there was no &s;atisfaction but the blood of our Redeemer that could con&s;i&s;tently with God's ju&s;tice, be accepted by him, our condition was quite de&s;perate; and no one could have expected, that God him|&s;elf &s;hould &s;ubmit to pay the ran&s;om for us, or indeed that it was po&s;&s;ible to unite the divine nature in &s;uch a manner to our &s;inful fle&s;h, that as man had &s;inned &s;o man &s;hould &s;uffer; and yet that his &s;ufferings by virtue of that Union, &s;hould
<PB N="155" REF="164">
be a full, perfect, and &s;ufficient &s;acrifice, though impo&s;&s;ible for mere man to make it. But thus it was ordered; thus was God &s;atisfied, and Man redeemed from mi&s;ery. And he who is not affected by &s;uch benefits as the&s;e, who can reflect on them without love and gratitude, as he cer|tainly will, &s;o he well de&s;erves to lo&s;e them, &s;ince notwith&s;tanding Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings, his portion will be no better for them.</P>
<P>And this leads me to ob&s;erve another u&s;e we ought to make of God's goodne&s;s thus manife&s;ted to us, which is, that we labour to &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings thus pur|cha&s;ed for us by the blood of Chri&s;t. It is true, there is now no other &s;acrifice re|quired by God, but the Blood of our Re|deemer, who was wounded for our tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, was brui&s;ed for our iniquities; the cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace was upon him, and by his &s;tripes were we healed. But we are not &s;o healed and recovered, as to be in no danger of relap&s;ing; we are not &s;o re&s;cued from the bondage of &s;in, as
<PB N="156" REF="165">
to be perfectly &s;ecure of God's favour for the future. The Chri&s;tian life is a &s;tate of trial and conflict; he who bought us with a price hath a right to our Obedience, and when he exempted us from the pu|ni&s;hment of our &s;ins, he required us to for&s;ake them, to ab&s;tain from all wilful, and premeditated offences, and to repent of tho&s;e mi&s;carriages, which through the frailty and infirmity of our nature are un|avoidable; above all to pray to God for mercy and forgivene&s;s, and in order to ob|tain it, to be ready to forgive others; as Chri&s;t hath taught us, forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. So that to for|give tho&s;e that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us, is a ne|ce&s;&s;ary condition without which we cannot pray for the forgivene&s;s of our own tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Since then it is a matter of &s;o much con&s;equence to our happine&s;s, and a duty, which if we may judge from the practice of mankind, is one of the mo&s;t difficult of any our religion requires, I &s;hall make it
<PB N="157" REF="166">
my bu&s;ine&s;s to con&s;ider it more particu|larly.</P>
<P>In order to come to a full knowledge of the&s;e words, we mu&s;t fir&s;t enquire in what extent they are to be under&s;tood; for in the &s;ame extent that we pray to be for|given, it is our duty to forgive. Now when we pray to God to forgive us our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, we do not only mean that he &s;hall not puni&s;h us for them, but al&s;o that he &s;hould re&s;tore us to the &s;ame degree of love and favour that we &s;tood in before we &s;inned, that he would extend the goodne&s;s of his Providence to us, and vouch&s;afe us both temporal and eternal ble&s;&s;ings. Of what great importance it is to us to be thus re&s;tored to God's favour is obvious to any one; but there is one condition annexed to it which is to be feared does &s;ometimes prevent men from attempting it, and this is the forgivene&s;s of our enemies; by which we are not to under&s;tand the mere ab&s;tain|ing from hurting them, but al&s;o the &s;eek|ing every opportunity to do them good.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="167">
We ought according to our Saviour's command to love our enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them which de&s;pitefully u&s;e and per&s;ecute us. This is the de&s;crip|tion that our Saviour gives us of this duty, and the greate&s;t objection again&s;t the prac|tice of it ari&s;es from the va&s;t difficulty that is &s;uppo&s;ed to attend it. Many have gone &s;o far as to &s;ay it might be performed by an holy Apo&s;tle or perfect Saviour, but was without the reach of a common Chri&s;tian; and indeed in our pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances, the corruption of our nature, the violence of our pa&s;&s;ions, and the mi&s;|taken notions of the world con&s;idered, it is of all Chri&s;tian duties by far the mo&s;t dif|ficult to perform. But &s;ince God has made it the condition upon which we are to ex|pect forgivene&s;s, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for us to perform it, before we can have any title to the promi&s;e; for as our Saviour a&s;&s;ures us, if ye forgive men their tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es, your heavenly Father will al&s;o for|give you; but if ye forgive not men their
<PB N="159" REF="168">
tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider in how much greater a degree we have offended again&s;t God, than it is po&s;&s;ible for any one to offend again&s;t us, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee the rea&s;onablene&s;s of performing the condition for the reward annexed to it. The hopes of having our &s;ins pardoned, and obtaining eternal &s;alva|tion &s;hould certainly appear of &s;uch value in our &s;ight, as no labour however hard, no ta&s;k however difficult &s;hould deter us from &s;uch great expectations, much le&s;s &s;hould the rea&s;onable duty of doing as we would be done by, of forgiving others that we our&s;elves may obtain forgivene&s;s. If God is willing to remit to us a debt of &s;o va&s;t amount as ten thou&s;and talents, &s;hall we, with the wicked &s;ervant in the Go&s;|pel, rigorou&s;ly exact from a fellow &s;ervant the payment of an hundred pence? Should not we al&s;o have compa&s;&s;ion on our fellow &s;ervants even as God has pity on us?</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="169">
There are many motives to enforce the forgivene&s;s of injuries be&s;ides this, and one of the&s;e is, that it is an action truely great and honourable. Whatever advantages an high and revengeful &s;pirit may have in the eyes of the world, and however mean it may be e&s;teemed to put up and forgive in|juries, Religion teaches us a quite different le&s;&s;on. It in&s;tructs us that nothing can be truly honourable, which is not truly good, that nothing can be truly good which is not agreeable to the will of God; and that nothing can be agreeable to the will of God which is contrary to the laws his ble&s;&s;ed Son has given us in the Go&s;pel; and the&s;e pre&s;cribe to us to be meek as he is meek, and lowly as he is lowly.</P>
<P>But to de&s;cend from Religion to the opi|nion of the world. If there is any honour in gaining a victory, then is the forgive|ne&s;s of injuries truly honourable. It places us in eminence above our enemy, it gives us an invincible &s;uperiority over him, it makes us proof again&s;t all his devices, and
<PB N="161" REF="170">
unhurt by all his attacks; we either make him our friend, or convince mankind that he ought not to be our enemy; we either deprive him of the inclination to prejudice us, or &s;ubject him to the contempt of all good men if he per&s;everes in it; and at the &s;ame time that we make known the meekne&s;s of our di&s;po&s;ition by forgiving his ill offices, we approve our re&s;olution by not attending to the con&s;equences of his anger. If our enemy is worth the gain|ing, Forgivene&s;s is the be&s;t and mo&s;t ap|proved method to accompli&s;h that end; if he is not, Forgivene&s;s is the be&s;t method of puni&s;hing him, as it &s;erves mo&s;t effec|tually to di&s;appoint his aim, to &s;hew that his malice cannot reach us, and to gall him with that thought which men can lea&s;t bear, that we hold him in contempt, and think him beneath our notice.</P>
<P>A fal&s;e notion of honour may repre&s;ent to us the conquering of an enemy as a great and glorious action; but true rea&s;on will
<PB N="162" REF="171">
tell us, that to conquer our&s;elves, and for|give an enemy, is much more great, and, as it is more difficult, more honourable likewi&s;e. This is indeed a &s;pecies of ho|nour which will &s;carce find its way into the brea&s;t of a Hero, and meet with a fa|vourable reception from tho&s;e who call ra&s;hne&s;s courage, and di&s;grace the name of Honour by applying it improperly. Con|&s;ider the pre&s;ent acceptation of that word; we might imagine that it was the &s;worn foe of Hone&s;ty, Rea&s;on, and Religion, in|&s;tead of being the genuine offspring of them all. A modern Man of Honour (as He calls him&s;elf, and as the World will be complai&s;ant enough to call him) lives to Pa&s;&s;ion, and not to Rea&s;on; He lives in a con&s;tant &s;ubjection to the opinions of others, nor for a moment &s;uffers him&s;elf to have an opinion of his own; he takes things up on tru&s;t from tho&s;e whom he ought lea&s;t to depend upon; he fears &s;hame more than guilt, the imputation of crimes more than being criminal; he trembles at
<PB N="163" REF="172">
reproach (though unde&s;erved) more than at danger, or even death, and prides him|&s;elf on his courage at the very in&s;tant that he gives the &s;tronge&s;t proof of his being a Coward. To revenge, even in what we mi&s;call an honourable way, is an effort which many a Coward hath again&s;t his na|ture forced him&s;elf to make, but we can|not meet with a &s;ingle in&s;tance where he could induce him&s;elf to forgive. This is a ta&s;k left for men of great and gen'rous di&s;po&s;itions, for men who are as much above fearing, as doing ill, for men who have a true &s;en&s;e of Honour, and, in con|&s;equence thereof, doing every thing which They ought to do, fear nothing but what They ought to fear.</P>
<P>Another, and no weak motive to the forgivene&s;s of our enemies, is that quiet, and &s;atisfaction of mind which naturally re&s;ults from it. The man of a revengeful &s;pirit lives in a perpetual &s;torm, he is his own tormentor, and his guilt of cour&s;e be|comes
<PB N="164" REF="173">
his puni&s;hment. Tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which prompt him to wreek his vengeance on his enemies, war again&s;t his own &s;oul, and are incon&s;i&s;tent with his peace. Whe|ther he is at home or abroad, alone or in company, They &s;till adhere to him, and engro&s;s his thoughts; and Providence hath with the greate&s;t rea&s;on ordained, that who&s;oever meditates again&s;t the peace of another &s;hall, even in the de&s;ign, lo&s;e his own. The thoughts of Revenge break in upon his mo&s;t &s;erious and important bu&s;i|ne&s;s, embitter his mo&s;t rational entertain|ments, and forbid him to reli&s;h any of tho&s;e good things which God hath placed within his reach; ever intent on the con|trivance of mi&s;chief, or engaged in the ex|ecution, mortified with di&s;appointments, or, his de&s;igns accompli&s;hed, tortured with reflection, he lives the life of a devil here on earth, and carries about a hell in his own brea&s;t. Whereas the meek man, who lives in a con&s;tant cour&s;e of good will to all, who gives no man cau&s;e to be his ene|my,
<PB N="165" REF="174">
and dares to forgive tho&s;e who are &s;o without a cau&s;e, hath a con&s;tant &s;pring of plea&s;ure in him&s;elf; let what will happen from without, he is &s;ure of peace within. So far from being afraid to conver&s;e with him&s;elf, he &s;eeks and is happy in the op|portunity of doing it, and meets with no|thing in his own brea&s;t but what encou|rages him to keep up and cheri&s;h that ac|quaintance. The Pa&s;&s;ions which he finds there, in&s;tead of being tyrants, are &s;er|vants; he knows the danger of obeying, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of rooting them out; and, whil&s;t he forbids them to a&s;&s;ume an undue influence, makes them the in&s;tru|ments of promoting his happine&s;s. Happy in him&s;elf, he is ea&s;y to all; he is a friend to mankind in general, and not an enemy even to tho&s;e who hate him; doth a mo|mentary thought of revenge ari&s;e in his mind he &s;uppre&s;&s;es it; if on no other con|&s;iderations, for his own &s;ake; this he knows to be his duty, and this he finds to be his plea&s;ure; ble&s;t with tho&s;e feelings, which
<PB N="166" REF="175">
&s;hall not leave him at the grave, he imi|tates the Deity in benevolence, and ob|tains, as far as mortals can obtain, the happine&s;s of the Deity in return.</P>
<P>Lea&s;t the&s;e con&s;iderations prove ineffec|tual, let me add the nece&s;&s;ity we lay un|der of forgiving our enemies, or of relin|qui&s;hing all hopes of being forgiven. There is no alternative. We mu&s;t do it, or re&s;ign all preten&s;ions to the benefits of Chri&s;t's pa&s;&s;ion. Though the performance of this duty alone will not entitle us to the forgivene&s;s of our &s;ins; yet this we are mo&s;t &s;pecially in&s;tructed in, that the per|formance of all other duties, without this, will be of no avail. The difficulty, attend|ing this work, in&s;tead of taking off our attention, ought to double it, and quicken our endeavours; That it is nece&s;&s;ary to be done, the Scriptures inform us, and there|fore it mu&s;t be undertaken; That it is dif|ficult to be done, our own feelings inform us, and therefore it &s;hould be undertaken
<PB N="167" REF="176">
with &s;pirit; That it is not impo&s;&s;ible to be done, and that we may accompli&s;h it if we will, the very enjoinment of the duty implies; That, when accompli&s;hed, we &s;hall not lo&s;e our reward, the Con&s;idera|tions I have already mentioned, with our own ob&s;ervation and experience, will hap|pily evince.</P>

<Q><HI>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Petition con&s;i&s;ts of two parts; the one, lead us not into tempta|tion, the other, but deliver us from evil. For the more particular under&s;tanding the former part, it will be proper to remove &s;uch acceptations of the word temp|tation, as are not intended in the u&s;e of this Petition: and &s;ince it is here &s;uppo&s;ed that God may lead a man into temptation, I will con&s;ider in what &s;en&s;e that mu&s;t be under&s;tood in this place.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="178">
A man may be &s;aid to lead another into temptation, when he entices him to &s;in, or by any argument, art, or violence, per|&s;uades or compels him to it. But we are not to under&s;tand any thing of this nature on God's part&mdash;for in this &s;en&s;e, God tempts no man. He neither de&s;igns, or lays any trap or &s;nares, to make men &s;in: he purpo&s;es nothing to their hopes or fears, to deceive, allure, or fright them into &s;in; nor does he by any impul&s;e on their minds, incline or nece&s;&s;itate them to &s;in; to conceive &s;uch things as the&s;e of God, would be the highe&s;t impiety.</P>
<P>Again. To tempt a man may &s;ignify in general to prove and try him, whether he will faithfully di&s;charge his duty, and an|&s;wer another's expectation of him, or not. In this &s;en&s;e, it is certain, God tempts every man; that is, he gives him occa&s;ions and opportunities of performing, or refu|&s;ing to do his duty. Thus the laws of God to mankind in general, or to Chri&s;tians in particular, the former by Nature, the
<PB N="171" REF="179">
latter by Revelation, are temptations or trials of our obedience, whether we will ob&s;erve them or not; and in regard that the circum&s;tances of men are very various, and that they have re&s;pective duties to be performed, therefore every man's particular condition of life, his honour or meanne&s;s, his wealth or poverty, his authority or &s;ub|jection, his &s;ingle or married &s;tate, his tem|per and con&s;titution of body, his health or &s;ickne&s;s, his calling and profe&s;&s;ion, in a word, his condition in life, with re&s;pect to circum&s;tances of this nature, which are infinite, is a temptation or trial, whether he will live up to the general rules of his religion, and perform that duty which his place, relation, and peculiar intere&s;t in the world, require of him. In this &s;en&s;e then, every man is led into temptation; that is, he hath the general rules of religion to ob&s;erve, and the particular duties proper to his place and condition to perform. And God who requires the&s;e, and by who&s;e pro|vidence men are put into &s;uch circum|&s;tances, may &s;o far be &s;aid to lead a man
<PB N="172" REF="180">
into Temptation. But as every man in this &s;en&s;e, is, and mu&s;t be tempted, this cannot be the meaning of the words, when we pray, not to be led into Temptation. By Temptation we may here al&s;o under&s;tand, tho&s;e hazardous tryals with which God is plea&s;ed &s;ometimes to prove good, and puni&s;h wicked men. So that God may be &s;aid to lead a man into Temptation, when he permits &s;ome extraordinary accidents to befal him, in order to try his &s;incerity. It is impo&s;&s;ible to mention the various kinds of Temptation to which we are liable, and perhaps it would be very hard for any man to declare which Temptation he could be&s;t re&s;i&s;t, or which would be mo&s;t difficult to him. We are &s;o ignorant of our&s;elves, in things of this nature, that we know not what trial we can be&s;t encounter; there|fore, we ought to leave the petition to God in general, as our Saviour hath here taught us, namely that God would not lead us into Temptation, or that he would keep tho&s;e Temptations from us, which he, who
<PB N="173" REF="181">
be&s;t knows our make and frame, by his infinite wi&s;dom &s;ees will mo&s;t endanger us.</P>
<P>Having thus con&s;idered the fir&s;t part of this petition, I proceed to the &s;econd.</P>
<P>But deliver us from evil: which &s;ignifies the &s;ame, and &s;omething more than the former. The &s;ame, as including deliver|ance from great and dangerous temptations; but more, as the evil is greater to fall under Temptations, than only to be tempted. If con&s;idered in the former &s;en&s;e, it implies God's providence in allotting us &s;uch a por|tion in this life, as he &s;ees is be&s;t for our &s;piritual e&s;tate, and in removing from us whatever he knows to be incon&s;i&s;tent there|with. It is al&s;o to be under&s;tood of tho&s;e innumerable methods of Providence, by which God keeps men from &s;undry temp|tations that would befal them, if he did not interpo&s;e to prevent them. Taking it in the latter &s;en&s;e, as keeping us from be|ing overcome by temptations when they happen, then the petition means, the good
<PB N="174" REF="182">
providence of God without us, and the motions and operations of his holy Spirit within us, whereby he &s;upports and pre|&s;erves tho&s;e who in the time of their trials tru&s;t in him. God delivers us by his out|ward providences, and which are very con|&s;iderable; &s;ometimes by the good examples of others labouring under the &s;ame circum|&s;tances, &s;ometimes by the faithful advice of a friend, the &s;ea&s;onable pre&s;ence of a good man, a &s;udden change in our for|tunes, and divers unfore&s;een accidents, ca|&s;ual indeed to us, but purpo&s;ely ordered by the wi&s;e di&s;po&s;al of God, to prevent our being led away by Temptations that a&s;&s;ault us; therefore, in this prayer, we commit our&s;elves to the good Providence of God, that he would &s;till continue to pre&s;erve us by &s;uch ways as to his wi&s;dom &s;eems mo&s;t requi&s;ite. By the operations of his holy &s;pirit within us, he delivers us from evil under Temptation, when he repre&s;ents to us the rea&s;ons of our duty, and &s;trongly impre&s;&s;es them on our minds; whereby good men have been often re&s;cued from
<PB N="175" REF="183">
their pa&s;&s;ions, and kept from falling when on the brink of danger. Therefore, in this prayer we intreat God not to ca&s;t us away from his pre&s;ence, nor take his holy &s;pirit from us, that he would not for&s;ake us when we are in the greate&s;t danger of forgetting him, but that his grace may prevent us from yielding to any Temptation, whether &s;udden, violent, or long, that &s;o we may never be tempted above what we are able to bear.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now offer &s;ome con&s;iderations that &s;hould make us in good earne&s;t pray again&s;t Temptations, that they may not overcome us, nor draw us into &s;in.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, let us con&s;ider the great con&s;e|quence of being overcome by Temptations.</P>
<P>If we are prevailed on to act contrary to our duty, the be&s;t end we can make is a &s;orrowful repentance; and which if &s;incere, brings abundantly more trouble, than the tran&s;itory enjoyment and &s;atisfaction of the
<PB N="176" REF="184">
mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;in. The advantage gained by con&s;enting to a Temptation, is gone long before we come to repent. Revenge is no longer &s;weet, than while the pa&s;&s;ion of malice la&s;ts, and what a man acquires un|ju&s;tly, mu&s;t be re&s;tored the moment true repentance begins. So that it is evidently nece&s;&s;ary for our own ea&s;e and quiet, not to enter into Temptation, or fall by it, though we &s;hould repent and reform, which is the be&s;t end we can promi&s;e our&s;elves; but if we &s;uppo&s;e the wor&s;t, that a man grows more ea&s;y to his &s;ins, and more rea|dily yields to the Devil's &s;ugge&s;tions, &s;o as to fill up the mea&s;ure of his iniquity, what follows? nothing le&s;s than fire unquench|able. If then we are concerned for the end, if we fear the dreadful &s;entence of everla&s;ting mi&s;ery, we have need, great need to pray, Lord, lead us not into Temp|tation, but deliver us from Evil.</P>
<P>The great difficulty of re&s;i&s;ting Temp|tations, is another rea&s;on for our u&s;ing this petition in good earne&s;t. For if we con|&s;ider
<PB N="177" REF="185">
the variety and number of Tempta|tions, we &s;hall find no age, calling, or con|dition of life, no con&s;titution of body or mind, totally free from all Temptations.</P>
<P>Youth is &s;ollicited by plea&s;ure and wan|tonne&s;s; riper years by the cares and pride of life; old age by di&s;content and &s;piteful|ne&s;s, and, to the admiration of all con&s;i|derate per&s;ons, by &s;en&s;ele&s;s covetou&s;ne&s;s. A calling gives an opportunity for di&s;ho|ne&s;ty and hard-dealing, griping and oppre&s;|&s;ions, and admini&s;ters Temptations to fal&s;e|hood and lying. A free &s;anguine temper is apt to run into improprietics, and good|nature into debauchery; a re&s;erved di&s;po|&s;ition into &s;ullene&s;s and di&s;content; &s;o that every con&s;titution hath its incident danger. If we conver&s;e with our friends, we are in danger of being flattered, if with our ene|mies, of increa&s;ing malice and revenge. Commendation is apt to make us vain, re|proof angry, reproach and contempt to fill us with hatred. If one hath more wealth, honour, beauty, or re&s;pect than
<PB N="178" REF="186">
another, he is ready to be elated with pride; or if he &s;ees him&s;elf herein excelled by any, that is a Temptation to envy.</P>
<P>If we live in ea&s;e and plenty, we are in danger of &s;alling into &s;loth and idlene&s;s; if we have much to do, then contention, peevi&s;hne&s;s, and all the vices incident to bu&s;ine&s;s, lie in wait to a&s;&s;ault us. It is hard to bear &s;ickne&s;s after long health, and to fall from wealth into poverty, or take up the cro&s;s. As in a &s;uffering condition, there are Temptations which naturally ari&s;e, and the change it&s;elf is a very &s;evere one, &s;o when a man unexpectedly comes into pro&s;perity, luxury and wantonne&s;s, pride and forgetfulne&s;s of God, will then more ea&s;ily be&s;et him.</P>
<P>In a word, we are expo&s;ed to the danger of divers &s;ins and lu&s;ts, each of which has &s;e|veral Temptations, and the one often makes the other &s;tronger. Being then thus be&s;et with dangers, it behoves us not only to be
<PB N="179" REF="187">
very circum&s;pect, but to pray al&s;o, Lord, &s;ave us, or we peri&s;h.</P>
<P>The frequency of Temptations, is al&s;o another argument to prove the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;tant prayer. The Temptation may be changed, but is never quite removed. Whil&s;t we are in the world we are &s;till on trial and duty. We have many enemies near at hand, always bu&s;y and urgent upon us, &s;o that we had need to watch and pray. A man's table is a &s;nare to him, his wealth an occa&s;ion of falling; he is often betrayed into exce&s;s, when he &s;u&s;pects no danger; if full of bu&s;ine&s;s, he is expo&s;ed to irreli|gion, covetou&s;ne&s;s, and anger; if inclined to company, he is ea&s;ily &s;educed to evil &s;peaking; he hath his tongue to bridle, his appetites and pa&s;&s;ions to manage, and to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from the temptations of fooli&s;h mirth, uncharitable cen&s;ures, and all the vices of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, we have our own depraved na|ture to &s;truggle with. Our outward &s;en&s;es
<PB N="180" REF="188">
are ever ready to let in Temptation, our imagination to entertain it, and our rea&s;on not &s;trong enough to re&s;i&s;t it. We are al&s;o be&s;et with a &s;ubtle and malicious adver&s;ary, who goeth about like a roaring lion, &s;eek|ing whom he may devour; his approaches are &s;ly and imperceptible; he is bu&s;y about us, when we think not of him. We are doing his work and con&s;enting to his &s;ug|ge&s;tions, when we only &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves to be gratifying an unrea&s;onable appetite, to plea&s;e a companion, or fal&s;e friend. On all the&s;e accounts then, it behoves us to pray in good earne&s;t, that we may not be led into Temptation, but delivered from Evil; and this brings me to ob&s;erve, la&s;tly, what qualifications are nece&s;&s;ary to make us &s;incere in praying to be delivered from Temptation. And the&s;e are, to have a mo|de&s;t and humble opinion of our&s;elves, to be &s;en&s;ible of the dangers, difficulties, and our own inability to prevail again&s;t them, without the &s;pecial grace of God. We mu&s;t al&s;o have a firm belief and tru&s;t in the grace and providence of God, acknow|ledging
<PB N="181" REF="189">
that he governs and over-rules all things; that the cour&s;e of this world is not merely conducted by natural cau&s;es, and the free-will of man; but that God always can, and &s;ometimes does interpo&s;e, to alter the cour&s;e of nature, and the inclinations of free agents, for the benefit of the good, and the puni&s;hment of the wicked.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, we mu&s;t be mo&s;t willing and de|&s;irous to keep innocence, and to do the thing that is right; otherwi&s;e we do not, in good earne&s;t, de&s;ire the concurrence of God's providence and grace to this purpo&s;e. And this our &s;incerity we &s;hould expre&s;s by a general care of doing all we can to contri|bute towards it; more particularly in not encouraging evil thoughts and imaginations, which tend to corrupt our wills and affec|tions, and to make them break out into practice. He that plays with wanton, am|bitious, or covetous fancies, is acting for the Devil again&s;t him&s;elf. To be often thinking on the riches and advantages of another, is the beginning of envy. We
<PB N="182" REF="190">
are therefore to watch and pray, that we enter not into Temptation, and the man who will not watch over him&s;elf, is not fit to pray that God would watch over him.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t al&s;o be careful to avoid all Temptation to &s;in as much as po&s;&s;ible, and every thing that will make our duty diffi|cult. If we do not our&s;elves carefully avoid Temptation, how can we de&s;ire God to keep us from it. Every man &s;hould con|&s;ider in what in&s;tances he is mo&s;t likely to be tempted. This, upon an examination of our pa&s;t actions we may ea&s;ily find. For if we are ignorant of our own temper, yet we may ea&s;ily know what our practice has been, and from thence learn what tho&s;e temptations and occa&s;ions of &s;in are, which we &s;hould principally &s;hun. To reflect on our pa&s;t conver&s;ation, cannot indeed undo what has happened, but it may prevent the like for the future, by rendering us more cautious and vigilant. And he who doth not &s;eriou&s;ly endeavour to know his greate&s;t danger, and how to avoid it, &s;peaks
<PB N="183" REF="191">
words at random, when he de&s;ires God to deliver him from Temptation.</P>
<P>To conclude; in all the prayers we offer to God for any ble&s;&s;ing or good thing in behalf of our&s;elves or others, it is thereby implied that we promi&s;e God to contribute all that we can towards their being effected; and therefore, if we do not perform what we &s;o promi&s;e, our prayer is no better than that of a hypocrite; whereas, if we do, we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that God will not &s;uffer us to be tempted above that we are able to bear, but that, with the Tempta|tion, he will al&s;o make a way for us to e&s;cape.</P>

I &s;hall therefore explain the mean|ing of the&s;e words, and &s;hew what &s;en&s;e we ought to have in our minds, when we
<PB N="186" REF="193">
expre&s;s them; and then ob&s;erve what duties we may learn, and are in&s;tructed in, by the u&s;e thereof.</P>
<P>The&s;e words may be under&s;tood as a re|cognition and acknowledgment of the greatne&s;s and maje&s;ty of God, and may be thus paraphra&s;ed. We heartily acknow|ledge thy &s;upreme dominion over us, and the whole world; we adore and wor&s;hip thee as the great King, the Sovereign Lord of all. We al&s;o humbly admire and prai&s;e that infinite power, whereby thou go|verne&s;t the world, and ordere&s;t all the affairs of it according to thine own plea|&s;ure; and we give thee the glory of thy Greatne&s;s and Power, for all the good thou do&s;t to any, e&s;pecially for what thou be|&s;towe&s;t on us: and la&s;tly, we hereby ac|knowledge that God is unchangeable, that he ever was, and will be, as great, power|ful, and glorious as he now is, being in|finitely and eternally the &s;ame, ye&s;terday, to-day and for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="194">
We may al&s;o under&s;tand the&s;e words as a&s;&s;igning &s;ome rea&s;ons inducing us to a&s;k, and God to grant us our &s;everal reque&s;ts; and the connection between the&s;e words, and the foregoing petition by the word For, &s;eems to favour this interpretation. And then the full &s;en&s;e that we ought to have in our minds, when we &s;ay this Conclu&s;ion of the Lord's Prayer, will be thus.</P>
<P>And having now offered up our Petitions for what we want, it is but fit that we &s;hould al&s;o render thee our prai&s;e and thanks for what we have received. We therefore acknowledge that thou art a great King, whom we ought to wor&s;hip with the lowe&s;t reverence, and that thy Power is infinite to grant what we have reque&s;ted. We confe&s;s that thy Glory is above all, and humbly de&s;ire that thou maye&s;t be glori|fied in all things. La&s;tly we acknowledge, that thy kingdom, power, and glory are for ever, eternal and immutable; and there|fore we will at all times put our whole
<PB N="188" REF="195">
tru&s;t in thee, becau&s;e thou can&s;t never fail us.</P>
<P>From this form of prai&s;e being added by our Lord, to that form of Prayer which he hath taught us to u&s;e, we may learn, that it is always our duty to join to our prayers for what we want, our prai&s;es and thank&s;|givings al&s;o for the mercies that we have received, with joyful acknowledgments of his maje&s;ty, greatne&s;s and bounty; that we &s;hould pray without cea&s;ing, and in every thing give thanks, and by prayer and &s;upplication with thank&s;giving let our re|que&s;ts be made known unto God. And in particular from the fir&s;t clau&s;e of this dox|ology, for thine is the kingdom, we are reminded that it is our duty in all things to &s;ubmit to the will of God, and to re&s;ign our&s;elves to his di&s;po&s;al, he having &s;ove|reign dominion over all.</P>
<P>From the &s;econd clau&s;e of it, thine is the power, we &s;hould learn that it is our duty, in all &s;traits and difficulties to apply
<PB N="189" REF="196">
for his grace to help, direct, and &s;upport us, and in all our dangers and wants to rely on his Almighty Power, to relieve and de|liver us.</P>
<P>From the third clau&s;e of it, thine is the glory, we are taught to direct all our ac|tions to his Glory, to whom we here ac|knowledge that all Glory is due. According to the Apo&s;tle therefore, whether ye eat or drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, from that eternity which we here acknowledge in all the divine attributes and perfections, we are taught to wor&s;hip God continually, to prai&s;e him evermore, and to give divine honours to none be&s;ides him; becau&s;e he is God from everla&s;ting to ever|la&s;ting, the only God, and will not give his Glory to another.</P>
<P>As to the word Amen, it &s;ignifies verily, truly, or the like; a phra&s;e often u&s;ed by our Saviour at the beginning of his &s;peeches,
<PB N="190" REF="197">
to engage the attention of his hearers to what he was going to &s;ay. This being the proper meaning of the word Amen, the de&s;ign of adding it at the conclu&s;ion of any di&s;cour&s;e, is to affirm what had been before &s;aid, thereby declaring our approbation and con&s;ent thereto. Thus when we repeat the Creed, we &s;ay Amen; where it &s;ignifies &s;o it is, this is the true Faith, or all this I &s;tedfa&s;tly believe. And in like manner is the word u&s;ed, in the Commination ordered to be read on the fir&s;t day of Lent.</P>
<P>When we &s;ay Amen at the end of the Creed, or any profe&s;&s;ion of our belief, it means the &s;ame as if we repeated over again all that profe&s;&s;ion of our Faith, which we had before made in &s;everal words and &s;en|tences, and is a fre&s;h declaration of our con|&s;ent to &s;uch articles of our Belief. But when the word Amen, is joined to the end of a Prayer, as here, it then means to ex|pre&s;s our wi&s;h and de&s;ire that what we have reque&s;ted may be granted. Thus when our Lord &s;aid, &s;urely I am come quickly, the
<PB N="191" REF="198">
Apo&s;tle immediately adds, Amen, even &s;o, come Lord Je&s;us; that is, may it be as thou ha&s;t promi&s;ed; and of the like u&s;e is this word when added at the end of tho&s;e bene|dictions, wherewith mo&s;t of the Epi&s;tles in the New Te&s;tament are concluded.</P>
<P>If therefore a Prayer is &s;aid by one, and Amen added to it, is &s;aid by another, as is common in our publick prayers, where the mini&s;ter only &s;peaks, and the people &s;ay Amen, then it &s;ignifies their con&s;ent to, and concurrence with the whole prayer ut|tered by the mini&s;ter; and is the &s;ame as when in the Litany we be&s;eech God to hear us; but if Amen is &s;aid by the &s;ame per&s;on who &s;peaks the Prayer, as when we add it to our private devotions, then Amen is a repitition in one word, of all that has been before &s;aid in the Prayer; 'tis a fre&s;h breathing forth of all tho&s;e pious de&s;ires and affections of the mind, that had been before more largely expre&s;&s;ed. Thus much for the meaning of the word Amen.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="199">
And as we are here taught by our Lord him&s;elf to add this word at the end of our prayers, to te&s;tify our con&s;ent thereto, it from hence plainly appears, that all publick prayers ought to be expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a lan|guage and &s;tile, as that all may under&s;tand them; or otherwi&s;e they cannot &s;ay Amen, as it means their approving of, and giving a rational con&s;ent thereto. It is therefore highly expedient, nay, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the edification of the Church, that the publick prayers which are intended for the u&s;e of all, &s;hould be &s;uited to the capaci|ties of all, and be as plain, ea&s;y, and fa|miliar as po&s;&s;ible, not only carefully avoid|ing all high flights, rhetorical figures, and flouri&s;hes, but all &s;uch words as are not of very ea&s;y meaning, and common u&s;e. In a word, the publick Prayers &s;hould be like tho&s;e of our Church; the words common, the &s;tile ea&s;y, the &s;entences &s;hort, the whole phra&s;e and compo&s;ure &s;uited to the meane&s;t capacity; and in general is a great advan|tage which premeditated Prayers have over &s;uch as are conceived extempore, &s;ince he
<PB N="193" REF="200">
that makes a prayer for publick u&s;e, takes time to &s;tudy plainne&s;s and per&s;picuity, which het hat prays extempore cannot do.</P>
<P>But above all, it is manife&s;tly mo&s;t ab|&s;urd, that the publick Prayers in which all are to join, &s;hould be in an unknown tongue, in a language not under&s;tood perhaps by one in twenty in the whole congregation. The mo&s;t ridiculous folly of this is &s;uffi|ciently expo&s;ed by St. Paul, and among other arguments by this; that no man can rationally &s;ay Amen to a prayer uttered in an unknown tongue. I will, &s;ays he, pray with the &s;pirit, and with the under&s;tand|ing al&s;o; I will &s;ing with the &s;pirit, and with the under&s;tanding al&s;o; el&s;e when thou &s;halt ble&s;s with the &s;pirit, how &s;hall he that occupieth the room of the un|learned &s;ay Amen, at the giving of thanks, &s;eeing he under&s;tands not what thou &s;aye&s;t; for thou verily who under&s;tande&s;t the lan|guage thou &s;peake&s;t in, give&s;t thanks well, but the other&mdash;he who under&s;tands it not&mdash;is not edified. But when we &s;ay Amen
<PB N="194" REF="201">
to any prayer we addre&s;s to God, it is &s;up|po&s;ed that we both under&s;tood and gave attention to what went before, &s;ince we thereby give our con&s;ent to, and declare our approbation of it. But how can we do that, unle&s;s we attend to what is &s;aid?</P>
<P>By the word Amen therefore, we are in&s;tructed in another duty, namely, that when we are at Prayer, to keep our mind to our bu&s;ine&s;s, diligently to attend to what we are about, to avoid if po&s;&s;ible all wan|dering thoughts, to be duly affected with every part of that prayer, we either &s;peak our&s;elves, or hear pronounced by the mi|ni&s;ter in our names; and to have &s;uch thoughts and de&s;ires in our minds through|out the whole office, as the words we then &s;peak do import and &s;ignify. For unle&s;s we thus attend to what we &s;ay, our &s;ervice will be only lip-wor&s;hip, neither accepta|ble to God, nor profitable to our&s;elves. But if in our minds we give &s;uch con&s;ent to every petition we offer up, as is fit and proper for us to give, then the word Amen
<PB N="195" REF="202">
at the end of all, uttered with fervency and devotion, will fully comprehend the whole prayer; and we &s;hall repeat in one devout breath, as much as we prayed for in the whole office.</P>
<P>Having thus gone through every part of the Lord's Prayer, I &s;hall make but one general ob&s;ervation, that the whole is &s;o framed and contrived, as to &s;erve both for an expre&s;&s;ion of our devotion to God, and an in&s;truction to our&s;elves; that the &s;ame words which teach us what to reque&s;t of God, al&s;o in&s;truct us in our duty, and ex|cite us to the performance of it; &s;o that its frequent u&s;e mu&s;t be of &s;ingular benefit and advantage to us. But then it is a cer|tain truth, that as no wicked man, who continues in his wickedne&s;s, can &s;ay this prayer with good attention and &s;erious de|votion, &s;o every good per&s;on who doth &s;ay it in that manner, mu&s;t needs by natural efficacy, as well as by the divine grace and ble&s;&s;ing, be rendered much better by the
<PB N="196" REF="203">
u&s;e thereof. For a wicked man continuing &s;uch, cannot have tho&s;e inward affections of mind towards God, that the words of this prayer do expre&s;s, nor yet any hearty de&s;ire to obtain what he reque&s;ts of God, becau&s;e &s;uch devout affections and holy de|&s;ires are directly contrary to, and incon|&s;i&s;tent with the love and practice of Sin. For how can he pre&s;ume to call upon God in prayer, who in works denies him? How can he with holy devotion call God his Father, who hath &s;old him&s;elf to the Devil to work wickedne&s;s, and continually exerci&s;es him&s;elf therein? For who&s;oever is born of God &s;inneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth him&s;elf pure, and that wicked one toucheth him not. How can he &s;ay to God with true devotion, hallowed be thy name, who di&s;honours him in his whole life? how can he be &s;e|rious in de&s;iring the holy name of God may be &s;anctified by all, who is him&s;elf conti|nually pro&s;aning and bla&s;pheming it by wicked oaths and horrid imprecations? how
<PB N="197" REF="204">
can he pray heartily that the kingdom of God may be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world, who will not him&s;elf be ruled and governed by him? mu&s;t not his heart give his tongue the lye, while he &s;ays with his mouth, thy kingdom come, but in his heart &s;ays unto God, depart from us, what is the Al|mighty that we &s;hould &s;erve him, and what profit &s;hould we have if we pray unto him? how can a man &s;ay with true and fervent devotion, thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven, who continually oppo&s;es and re&s;i&s;ts the divine will, who neither &s;ubmits to the providence of God, nor obeys his precepts, but is abominable and di&s;obedi|ent, and to every good work reprobate? Indeed in the petition, give us this day our daily bread, there is nothing as to the mat|ter but what a wicked man may agree to, for he may and often doth more earne&s;tly de&s;ire the things of this life than the good man. But then as to the manner of de|&s;iring them, he can no more utter this pe|tition with true devotion, than any of the
<PB N="198" REF="205">
former; becau&s;e he doth not depend on God, nor expect tho&s;e things from his ble&s;&s;ing, but from his own indu&s;try and cunning; for if he regarded them as divine ble&s;&s;ings, he would not acquire them by fraud and inju&s;tice, extortion and oppre&s;|&s;ion. Nor can the wicked man with true devotion &s;ay, forgive us our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, for though pardon of &s;ins is what he wants, and ought earne&s;tly to wi&s;h God would grant, yet it is ab&s;urd to imagine, he would offer up any petition to God, the matter of which he him&s;elf knows is highly unrea|&s;onable; and what can be more unrea&s;on|able or unfit for God to grant, or more profane and pre&s;uming in any to a&s;k, than that he would pardon an unrepenting &s;in|ner. To a&s;k this of God is the &s;ame as to de&s;ire him to abrogate all his holy laws, and to grant us a licen&s;e to tran&s;gre&s;s them. As little can a wicked man &s;incerely pray, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil; for as every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lu&s;t,
<PB N="199" REF="206">
this is what the wicked man chu&s;es, he gives him&s;elf up to his own heart's lu&s;ts, and delights to follow his wicked imagi|nations, &s;o that to pray again&s;t temptation, is to pray again&s;t him&s;elf, and therefore he cannot be hearty in this petition, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e what is impo&s;&s;ible; that a man &s;hould at the &s;ame time love and hate, chu&s;e and refu&s;e the &s;ame things. La&s;tly, when &s;uch an one &s;ays, for thine is the kingdom, and the power and the glory for ever, which is both an acknowledgement of the infinite and adorable perfections of God, and giving him the prai&s;e and glory due unto him, how can it be &s;uppo&s;ed his heart &s;hould go along with his words, when at the &s;ame time it appears by the whole cour&s;e and tenor of his wicked life, that he neither owns the &s;overeign dominion of God, dreads his power, nor &s;ecks his glory.</P>
<P>Thus it is very evident that a wicked man, continuing &s;uch, cannot &s;ay this
<PB N="200" REF="207">
prayer or any one petition in it, with good attention and fervent devotion; nor can he have &s;uch inward affections of mind towards God, as the words expre&s;s, nor any hearty de&s;ire to obtain tho&s;e things which he &s;eems to reque&s;t of God; for if he had, he would &s;oon become a better man. Whereas every good man by u&s;ing this prayer, mu&s;t natu|rally be rendered better. Since when he calls on God as his Father, he is reminded of that filial love and duty which he owes him; when he prays that God's name may be hallowed, his own mind mu&s;t then al&s;o be filled with an awful reverence towards him; when he &s;ays thy kingdom come, he is at the &s;ame time admoni&s;hed to &s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of God, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s; when he &s;ays thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven, he is then taught his own duty humbly to re&s;ign him&s;elf to God's plea&s;ure, and with all readine&s;s and chear|fulne&s;s to obey his commands. When he prays for his daily bread, he exerci&s;es an act of tru&s;t in God's providence, and is
<PB N="201" REF="208">
cautioned not to u&s;e any means to procure the good things of this life, but what he hath rea&s;on to expect for God's ble&s;&s;ing upon. When he begs of God forgivene&s;s of his &s;ins, this petition mu&s;t be grounded on the te&s;timony of his own con&s;cience, that he is truly penitent, and doth actually exerci&s;e &s;uch mercy and charity towards tho&s;e who have offended him, as God hath made the condition of his being pardoned. When he de&s;ires of God not to be led into temptation, if his reque&s;t is &s;incere, he will carefully avoid tho&s;e dangers, which he earne&s;tly prays to be delivered from. La&s;tly, when he gives glory to God, by a &s;olemn acknowledgment of the divine per|fections, &s;aying thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory for ever, if he is really affected with what he expre&s;&s;es, every time he devoutly repeats the&s;e words, his love to God will be increa&s;ed, his faith &s;trengthened, and his obedience confirmed.</P>
<P>To conclude; &s;uch being the excellency of this Prayer, &s;uch the advantages of our
<PB N="202" REF="209">
&s;incerely repeating it, what remains, but that, as the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, in compa&s;&s;ion to our infirmities, hath taught us how to pray, &s;o &s;hould we mo&s;t earne&s;tly implore his holy Spirit to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in Prayer, that by always pronouncing the&s;e words with at|tention and fervent devotion, we may thereby obtain his gracious promi&s;e, that what&s;oever we a&s;k the Father in his name, he will give us, that the Father may be glorified in his &s;on.</P>
<P>Now to God the Father, &amp;c.</P>
