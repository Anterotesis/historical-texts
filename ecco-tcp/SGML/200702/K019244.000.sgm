<P>&mdash;THOUGH the theatre is now breaking, it is allowed &s;till to &s;ell animals there; therefore, if any la|dy or gentleman have occa&s;ion for a tame elephant, let them enquire of Mr. Pinkethman, who has one to di&s;|po&s;e of at a rea&s;onable rate. The downfal of May-Faire has quite &s;unk the price of this noble creature, as well as of many other curio&s;ities of nature. A tiger will &s;ell almo&s;t as cheap as an ox; and I am credibly informed, a man may purcha&s;e a cat with three legs, for very near the value of one with four. I hear like|wi&s;e, that there is a great de&s;olation among the gen|tlemen and ladies who were the ornaments of the town, and u&s;ed to &s;hine in plumes and diadems; the heroes being mo&s;t of them pre&s;&s;ed, and the queens beating hemp. Mrs. Sarabrand, &s;o famous for her ingenious puppet-&s;how, has &s;et up a &s;hop in the Exchange, where &s;he &s;ells her little troop under the term of jointed ba|bies. I could not but be &s;ollicitous to know of her, how &s;he had di&s;po&s;ed of that rake hell Punch, who&s;e lewd life and conver&s;ation had given &s;o much &s;candal, and did not a little contribute to the ruin of the faire. She told me, with a &s;igh, that de&s;pairing of ever reclaiming him, &s;he would not offer to place him in a civil family, but got him in a po&s;t upon a &s;tall in Wapping, where he may be &s;een from &s;un-ri&s;ing to &s;un-&s;etting, with a gla&s;s in one hand, and a pipe in the other, as centry to a brandy-&s;hop. The great revolutions of this nature bring to my mind the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the unfortunate Ca|milla,
<PB N="2" REF="5">
who has had the ill luck to break before her voice, and to di&s;appear at a time when her beauty was in the height of its bloom. This lady entered &s;o throughly into the great characters &s;he acted, that when &s;he had fini&s;hed her part, &s;he could not think of re|trenching her equipage, but would appear in her own lodgings with the &s;ame magnificence that &s;he did upon the &s;tage. This greatne&s;s of &s;oul has reduced that un|happy prince&s;s to an involuntary retirement, where &s;he now pa&s;&s;es her time among the woods and fore&s;ts, think|ing on the crowns and &s;cepters &s;he has lo&s;t, and often humming over in her &s;olitude,
<Q><L>I was born of royal race,</L>
<L>Yet mu&s;t wander in di&s;grace, <HI>etc.</HI></L></Q>
But for fear of being over-heard, and her quality known, &s;he u&s;ually &s;ings it in Italian;
<Q><L>Naqui al Regno, naqui al Trono</L>
<L>E pur &s;ono</L>
<L>Iventurata Pa&s;torella&mdash;</L></Q>
Since I have touched upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hall commu|nicate to my reader part of a letter I have received from a friend at Am&s;terdam, where there is a very noble the|atre; though the manner of furni&s;hing it with actors is &s;omething peculiar to that place, and gives us occa&s;ion to admire both the politene&s;s and frugality of the people.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'MY friends have kept me here a week longer than ordinary to &s;ee one of their plays, which was perform|ed la&s;t night with great applau&s;e. The actors are all of them trade&s;men, who, after their day's work is over, earn about a gilder a night by per&s;onating kings and generals. The hero of the tragedy I &s;aw, was a jour|ney-man taylor, and his fir&s;t mini&s;ter of &s;tate a coffee-man. The empre&s;s made me think of Parthenope in
<PB N="3" REF="6">
the Rehear&s;al; for her mother keeps an ale-hou&s;e in the &s;uburbs of Am&s;terdam. When the tragedy was o|ver, they entertained us with a &s;hort farce, in which the cobler did his part to a miracle; but upon enqui|ry, I found he had really been working at his own trade, and repre&s;enting on the &s;tage what he acted eve|ry day in his &s;hop. The profits of the theatre main|tain an ho&s;pital: for as here they do not think the profe&s;&s;ion of an actor the only trade that a man ought to exerci&s;e, &s;o they will not allow any-body to grow rich on a profe&s;&s;ion that in their opinion &s;o little con|duces to the good of the common-wealth. If I am not mi&s;taken, your play-hou&s;es in England have done the &s;ame thing; for, unle&s;s I am mi&s;informed, the ho|&s;pital at Dulledge was erected and endowed by Mr. Allen a player: and it is al&s;o &s;aid, a famous &s;he-trage|dian has &s;ettled her e&s;tate, after her death, for the maintenance of decayed wits, who are to be taken in as &s;oon as they grow dull, at whatever time of their life that &s;hall happen.'</Q></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own apartment, <DATE>September 30.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM called off from public di&s;&s;ertations by a dome|&s;tic affair of great importance, which is no le&s;s than the di&s;po&s;al of my &s;i&s;ter Jenny for life. The girl is a girl of great merit, and plea&s;ing conver&s;ation; but I being born of my father's fir&s;t wife, and &s;he of his third, &s;he conver&s;es with me rather like a daughter than a &s;i&s;ter. I have indeed told her, that if &s;he kept her honour, and behaved her&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as became the Bicker&s;taffs, I would get her an agreeable man for her hu&s;band; which was a promi&s;e I made her after reading a pa&s;&s;age in Pliny's Epi&s;tles. That polite author had been employed to find out a con&s;ort for his friend's daughter, and gives the following character of the man he had pitched upon.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Aciliano plurimum vigoris et indu&s;triae quanquam in max|ima verecundia: e&s;t illi facies liberalis, multo &s;anguine, multo rubore, &s;uffu&s;a: e&s;t ingenua totius corporis pulchri|tudo, et quidam &s;enatorius decor, quae ego nequaquam arbitror negligenda; debet enim hoc ca&s;titati puellarum qua&s;i praemium dari.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Acilianus is a man of extraordinary vigour and in|du&s;try, accompanied with the greate&s;t mode&s;ty. He has very much of the gentleman, with a lively colour, and flu&s;h of health in his a&s;pect. His whole per&s;on is finely turned, and &s;peaks him a man of quality: which are qulifications, that, I think, ought by no means to be overlooked, and &s;hould be be&s;towed on a daugh|ter as the reward of her cha&s;tity.'</Q></P>
<P>A woman, that will give her&s;elf liberties, need not put her parents to &s;o much trouble; for if &s;he does not po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e ornaments in a hu&s;band, &s;he can &s;upply her&s;elf el&s;e|where. But this is not the ca&s;e of my &s;i&s;ter Jenny, who, I may &s;ay without vanity, is as un&s;potted a &s;pin|&s;ter
<PB N="7" REF="10">
as any in Great Britain. I &s;hall take this occa&s;ion to recommend the conduct of our own family in this particular.</P>
<P>We have, in the genealogy of our hou&s;e, the de&s;cri|ptions and pictures of our ance&s;tors from the time of king Arthur; in who&s;e days there was one of my own name, a knight of his round table, and known by the name of Sir I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff. He was low of &s;tature, and of a very &s;warthy complexion, not unlike a Portugue&s;e Jew. But he was more prudent than men of that height u&s;ual|ly are, and would often communicate to his friends his de&s;ign of lengthening and whitening his po&s;terity. His elde&s;t &s;on Ralph (for that was his name) was for this rea|&s;on married to a lady who had little el&s;e to recommend her but that &s;he was very tall and fair. The i&s;&s;ue of this match, with the help of his &s;hoes, made a tolerable figure in the next age; though the complexion of the family was ob&s;cure 'till the fourth generation from that marriage. From which time, till the reign of William the Conqueror, the females of our hou&s;e were famous for their needle-work and fine &s;kins. In the male line there happened an unlucky accident in the reign of Richard the third, the elde&s;t &s;on of Philip, then chief of the family, being born with an hump-back and very high no&s;e. This was the more a&s;toni&s;hing, becau&s;e none of his forefathers ever had &s;uch a blemi&s;h; nor in|deed was there any in the neighbourhood of that make, except the butler, who was noted for round &s;houlders, and a Roman no&s;e: what made the no&s;e the le&s;s excu&s;|able, was the remarkable &s;mallne&s;s of his eyes.</P>
<P>The &s;everal defects were mended by &s;ucceeding match|es; his eyes were opened in the next generation, and the hump fell in a century and half; but the greate&s;t dif|ficulty was how to reduce the no&s;e; which I do not find was accompli&s;hed till about the middle of Henry the &s;eventh's reign, or rather the beginning of that of Hen|ry the eighth.</P>
<P>But while our ance&s;tors were thus taken up in culti|vating
<PB N="8" REF="11">
the eyes and no&s;e, the face of the Bicker&s;taffs fell down in&s;en&s;ibly into chin; which was not taken notice of (their thoughts being &s;o much employed upon the more noble features) till it became almo&s;t too long to be remedied.</P>
<P>But length of time, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive care in our allian|ces, have cured this al&s;o, and reduced our faces into that tolerable oval which we enjoy at pre&s;ent. I would not be tedious in this di&s;cour&s;e, but cannot but ob&s;erve, that our race &s;uffered very much about three hundred years ago, by the marriage of one of her heire&s;&s;es with an eminent courtier, who gave us &s;pindle-&s;hanks, and cramps in our bones, in&s;omuch that we did not recover our health and legs till Sir Walter Bicker&s;taff married Maud the milk-maid, of whom the then Garter king at arms (a facetious per&s;on) &s;aid plea&s;antly enough, that &s;he had &s;poiled our blood, but mended our con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>After this account of the effect our prudent choice of matches has had upon our per&s;ons and features, I can|not but ob&s;erve, that there are daily in&s;tances of as great changes made by marriage upon men's minds and hu|mours. One might wear any pa&s;&s;ion out of a family by culture, as skilful gardiners blot a colour out of a tulip that hurts its beauty. One might produce an affable tem|per out of a &s;hrew, by gra&s;ting the mild upon the cho|leric; or rai&s;e a jackpudding from a prude, by inocu|lating mirth and melancholy. It is for want of care in the di&s;po&s;ing of our children, with regard to our bodies and minds, that we go into an hou&s;e and &s;ee &s;uch dif|ferent complexions and humours in the &s;ame race and family. But to me it is as plain as a pike&s;taff, from what mixture it is, that this daughter &s;ilently lowers, the other &s;teals a kind lock at you, a third is exactly well behaved, a fourth a &s;plenatic, and a fifth a coquerte.</P>
<P>In this di&s;po&s;al of my &s;i&s;ter, I have cho&s;en, with an eye to ber being a wit, and provided, that the bride|groom be a man of a found and excellent jedgment, who will &s;eldom mind what &s;he &s;ays when &s;he begins to
<PB N="9" REF="12">
harangue: for Jenny's only imperfection is an admira|tion of her parts, which inclines her to be a little, but a very little, &s;lutti&s;h; and you are ever to remark, that we are apt to cultivate mo&s;t, and bring into ob&s;ervation, what we think mo&s;t excellent in our&s;elves, or mo&s;t cap|able of improvement. Thus my &s;i&s;ter, in&s;tead of con|&s;ulting her gla&s;s and her toilet for an hour and an half after her private devotion, &s;its with her no&s;e full of &s;nuff, and a man's nightcap on her head, reading plays and romances. Her wit &s;he thinks her di&s;tinction; there|fore knows nothing of the &s;kill of dre&s;s, or making her per&s;on agreeable. It would make you laugh, to &s;ee me often with my &s;pectacles on lacing her &s;tays; for &s;he is &s;o very a wit, that &s;he under&s;tands no ordinary thing in the world.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on I have di&s;po&s;ed of her to a man of bu|&s;ine&s;s, who will &s;oon let her &s;ee, that to be well dre&s;&s;ed, in good humour, and chearful in the command of her family, are the arts and &s;ciences of female life. I could have be&s;towed her upon a fine gentleman, who extreme|ly admired her wit, and would have given her a coach and &s;ix: but I found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to cro&s;s the &s;train; for had they met, they had eternally been rivals in di&s;cour&s;e, and in continual contention for the &s;uperio|rity of under&s;tanding, and brought forth critics, pedants, or pretty good poets.</P>
<P>As it is, I expect an off-&s;pring fit for the habitation of city, town or country; creatures that are docile and tra|ctable in whatever we put them to.</P>
<P>To convince men of the nece&s;&s;ity of taking this me|thod, let any one, even below the skill of an a&s;trologer, behold the turn of faces he meets as &s;oon as he pa&s;&s;es Cheap&s;ide-conduit, and you &s;ee a deep attention and a certain unthinking &s;harpne&s;s in every countenance. They look attentive, but their thoughts are engaged on mean purpo&s;es. To me it is very apparent when I &s;ee a citizen pa&s;s by, whether his head is upon woollen, &s;ilks, iron, &s;ugar, indigo, or &s;tocks. Now this trace of
<PB N="10" REF="13">
thought appears or lies hid in the race for two or three generations.</P>
<P>I know at this time a per&s;on of a va&s;t e&s;tate, who is the immediate de&s;cendant of a fine gentleman, but the great-grand&s;on of a broker, in whom his ance&s;tor is now revived. He is a very hone&s;t gentleman in his prin|ciples, but cannot for his blood talk fairly: he is hearti|ly &s;orry for it; but he cheats by con&s;titution, and over|reaches by in&s;tinct.</P>
<P>The happine&s;s of the man who marries my &s;i&s;ter will be, that he has no faults to correct in her but her own, a little bya&s;s of fancy, or particularity of manners which grew in her&s;elf, and can be amended by her. From &s;uch an untainted couple, we can hope to have our family ri&s;e to its ancient &s;plendor of face, air, countenance, manner and &s;hape, without di&s;covering the product of ten nations in one hou&s;e. Obadiah Green-hat &s;ays, he never comes into any company in England, but he di|&s;tingui&s;hes the different nations of which we are compo&s;|ed: there is &s;carce &s;uch a living creature as a true Bri|tain. We &s;it down indeed all friends, acquaintance, and neighbours; but after two bottles, you &s;ee a Dane &s;tart up and &s;wear, the kingdom is his own. A Saxon drinks up the whole quart, and &s;wears, he will di&s;pute that with him. A Norman tells them both, he will a&s;&s;ert his liberty: and a Wel&s;hman cries, they are all foreigners and intruders of ye&s;terday, and beats them out of the room. Such accidents happen frequently among neigh|bours children, and cou&s;in-germans. For which rea&s;on I &s;ay, &s;tudy your race, or the &s;oil of your family will dwindle into cits or '&s;quires, or run up into wits or madmen.</P>

<P>THERE are two kinds of immortality; that which the &s;oul really enjoys after this life, and that imaginary exi&s;tence by which men live in their fame and reputation. The be&s;t and greate&s;t actions have proceeded from the pro&s;pect of the one or other of the&s;e; but my de&s;ign is to treat only of tho&s;e who have chiefly propo&s;ed to them&s;elves the latter as the principal reward of their labours. It was for this rea|&s;on that I excluded from my tables of fame all the great founders and votaries of religion; and it is for this rea|&s;on al&s;o that I am more than ordinarily anxious to do ju&s;tice to the per&s;ons of whom I am now going to &s;peak; for &s;ince Fame was the only end of all their en|terprizes and &s;tudies, a man cannot be too &s;crupulous in allotting them their due proportion of it. It was this con&s;ideration which made me call the whole body of the learned to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; to many of whom I mu&s;t own my obligations for the catalogues of illu&s;tri|ous per&s;ons which they have &s;ent me in upon this oc|ca&s;ion. I ye&s;terday employed the whole afternoon in comparing them with each other; which made &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion upon my imagination, that they broke my &s;leep for the fir&s;t part of the following night, and at length threw me into a very agreeable vi&s;ion, which I &s;hall beg leave to de&s;cribe in all its particulars.</P>
<P>I dreamed that I was conveyed into a wide and boundle&s;s plain, that was covered with prodigious mul|titudes

of people, which no man could number. In the mid&s;t of it there &s;tood a mountain, with its head above the clouds. The &s;ides were extremely &s;teep, and of &s;uch a particular &s;tructure, that no creature, which was not made in a human figure, could po&s;&s;ibly a&s;cend it. On a &s;udden there was heard from the top of it a &s;ound like that of a trumpet; but &s;o exceeding &s;weet and har|monious, that it filled the hearts of tho&s;e who heard it with raptures, and gave &s;uch high and delightful &s;en&s;a|tions, as &s;eemed to animate and rai&s;e human nature a|bove it&s;elf. This made me very much amazed to find &s;o very few in that innumerable multitude, who had ears fine enough to hear or reli&s;h this mu&s;ic with plea&s;ure: but my wonder abated, when, upon looking round me, I &s;aw mo&s;t of them attentive to three &s;irens clothed like godde&s;&s;es, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of Sloth, Ig|norance, and Plea&s;ure. They were &s;eated on three rocks, amid&s;t a beautiful variety of groves, meadows, and rivu|lets that lay on the borders of the mountain. While the ba&s;e and groveling multitude of different nations, ranks, and ages, were li&s;tening to the&s;e delu&s;ive deities, tho&s;e of a more erect a&s;pect and exalted &s;pirit &s;eparated them&s;elves from the re&s;t, and marched in great bodies towards the mountain; from whence they heard the &s;ound, which &s;till grew &s;weeter the more they li&s;tened to it.</P>
<P>On a &s;udden, methought this &s;elect band &s;prang for|ward, with a re&s;olution to climb the a&s;cent, and follow the call of that heavenly mu&s;ic. Every one took &s;ome|thing with him that he thought might be of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to him in his march. Several had their &s;words drawn, &s;ome carried rolls of paper in their hands, &s;ome had compa&s;&s;es, others quadrants, others tele&s;copes, and others pencils; &s;ome had laurels on their heads, and others bu&s;kings on their legs: in &s;hort, there was &s;carce any in&s;trument of a mechanic art or a liberal &s;cience, which was not made u&s;e of on this occa&s;ion. My good Daemon, who &s;tood at my right hand during the cour&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="16">
of this whole vi&s;ion, ob&s;erving in me a kind of burning de&s;ire to join that glorious company, told me he highly approved that generous ardor with which I &s;eemed tran&s;|ported; but at the &s;ame time advi&s;ed me to cover my face with a ma&s;k all the while I was to labour on the a|&s;cent. I took his coun&s;el without inquiring into his rea&s;ons. The whole body now broke into different parties, and began to climb the precipice by ten thou&s;and different paths. Several got into little allies, which did not reach far up the hill, before they ended and led no further: and I ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t of the arti|zans, which con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed our number, fell in|to the&s;e paths.</P>
<P>We left another con&s;iderable body of adventurers be|hind us, who thought they had di&s;covered by-ways up the hill, which proved &s;o very intricate and perplexed, that after having advanced in them a little, they were quite lo&s;t among the &s;everal turns and windings; and though they were as active as any in their motions, they made but little progre&s;s in the a&s;cent. The&s;e, as my guide informed me, were men of &s;ubtle tempers, and puzzled politics, who would &s;upply the place of real wi&s;dom with cunning and artifice. Among tho&s;e, who were far advanced in their way, there were &s;ome that by one fal&s;e &s;tep fell backward, and lo&s;t more ground in a moment, than they had gained for many hours, or could be ever able to recover. We were now advanced very high, and ob&s;erved, that all the different paths which ran about the &s;ides of the mountain, began to meet in two great roads, which in&s;en&s;ibly gathered the whole multitude of travellers into two great bodies. At a little di&s;tance from the enterance of each road, there &s;tood an hideous phantom, that oppo&s;ed our further pa&s;&s;age. One of the&s;e apparitions had his right hand filled with darts, which he brandi&s;hed in the face of all who came up that way. Crouds ran back at the ap|pearance of it, and cried out <HI>Death.</HI> The &s;pectre that guarded the other road, was <HI>Envy:</HI> &s;he was not armed
<PB N="14" REF="17">
with weapons of de&s;truction like the former; but by dreadful hi&s;&s;ings, noi&s;es of reproach, and a horrid di|&s;tracted laughter, &s;he appeared more frightful than death it&s;elf, in&s;omuch that abundance of our company were di&s;couraged from pa&s;&s;ing any further, and &s;ome appear|ed a&s;hamed of having come &s;o far. As for my&s;elf, I mu&s;t confe&s;s my heart &s;hrunk within me at the &s;ight of the&s;e gha&s;tly appearances: but on a &s;udden, the voice of the trumpet came more full upon us, &s;o that we felt a new re&s;olution reviving in us; and in proportion as this re&s;olution grew, the terrors before us &s;eemed to va|ni&s;h. Mo&s;t of the company, who had &s;words in their hands, marched on with great &s;pirit, and an air of defi|ance, up the road that was commanded by Death; while others, who had thought and contemplation in their looks, went forward in a more compo&s;ed manner up the road po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Envy. The way above the&s;e apparations grew &s;mooth and uniform, and was &s;o de|lightful, that the travellers went on with plea&s;ure, and in a little time arrived as the top of the mountain. They here began to breathe a delicious kind of aether, and &s;aw all the fields about them covered with a kind of purple light, that made them reflect with &s;atisfaction on their pa&s;t toils, and diffu&s;ed a &s;ecret joy through the whole a&s;&s;embly, which &s;hewed it&s;elf in every look and feature. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e happy fields, there &s;tood a palace of a very glorious &s;tructure: it had four great folding|doors, that faced the four &s;everal quarters of the world. On the top of it was enthroned the godde&s;s of the mountain, who &s;miled upon her votaries, and &s;ounded the &s;ilver trumpet which had called them up, and chear|ed them in their pa&s;&s;age to her palace. They had now formed them&s;elves into &s;everal divi&s;ions, a band of hi|&s;torians taking their &s;tations at each door, according to the per&s;ons whom they were to introduce.</P>
<P>On a &s;udden the trumpet, which had hitherto &s;ound|ed only a march or a point of war, now &s;welled all its notes into triumph and exultation: the whole fabric
<PB N="15" REF="18">
&s;hook, and the doors flew open. The fir&s;t who &s;tepped forward, was a beautiful and blooming hero, and as I heard by the murmurs round me, Alexander the Great. He was conducted by a croud of hi&s;torians. The per|&s;on who immediately walked before him, was remark|able for an embroidered garment, who not being well acquainted with the place, was conducting him to an a|partment appointed for the reception of fabulous heroes. The name of this fal&s;e guide was Quintus Curtius. But Arrian and Plutarch, who knew better the avenues of this palace, conducted him into the great hall, and placed him at the upper end of the fir&s;t table. My good Dae|mon, that I might &s;ee the whole ceremony, conveyed me to a corner of this room, where I might perceive all that pa&s;&s;ed, without being &s;een my&s;elf. The next who entered was a charming virgin, leading in a venerable old man that was blind. Under her left arm &s;he bore a harp, and on her head a garland. Alexander, who was very well acquainted with Homer, &s;tood up at his en|terance, and placed him on his right hand. The vir|gin, who it &s;eems was one of the nine &s;i&s;ters that at|tended on the godde&s;s of Fame, &s;miled with an ineffable grace at their meeting, and retired.</P>
<P>Julius Cae&s;ar was now coming forward; and though mo&s;t of the hi&s;torians offered their &s;ervice to introduce him, he left them at the door, and would have no con|ductor but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The next who advanced was a man of a homely but chearful a&s;pect, and attended by per&s;ons of greater fi|gure than any that appeared on this occa&s;ion. Plato was on his right hand, and Xenophon on his left. He bow|ed to Homer, and &s;at down by him. It was expected that Plato would him&s;elf have taken a place next to his ma&s;ter Socrates; but on a &s;udden there was heard a great clamour of di&s;putants at the door, who appeared with Ari&s;totle at the head of them. That philo&s;opher, with &s;ome rudene&s;s, but great &s;trength of rea&s;on, convinced
<PB N="16" REF="19">
the whole table, that a title to the fifth place was his due, and took it accordingly.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce &s;at, down, when the &s;ame beautiful virgin that had introduced Homer brought in another, who hung back at the enterance, and would have excu&s;|him&s;elf, had not his mode&s;ty been overcome by the in|vitation of all who &s;at at the table. His guide and be|haviour made me ea&s;ily conclude it was Virgil. Cicero next appeared, and took his place. He had inquired at the door for Lucceius to introduce him; but not find|ing him there, he contented him&s;elf with the atten|dance of many other writers, who all, except Sallu&s;t, ap|peared highly plea&s;ed with the office.</P>
<P>We waited &s;ome time in expectation of the next wor|thy, who came in with a great retinue of hi&s;torians, who&s;e names I could not learn, mo&s;t of them being na|tives of Carthage. The per&s;on thus conducted, who was Hannibal, &s;eemed much di&s;turbed, and could not forbear complaining to the board of the affronts he had met with among the Roman hi&s;torians, who attempted, &s;ays he, to carry me into the &s;ubterraneous apartment; and perhaps would have done it, had it not been for the impartiality of this gentleman, pointing to Polybius, who was the only per&s;on, except my own countrymen, that was willing to conduct me hither.</P>
<P>The Carthaginian took his &s;eat, and Pompey entered with great dignity in his own per&s;on, and preceded by &s;everal hi&s;torians. Lucan the poet was at the head of them, who ob&s;erving Homer and Virgil at the table, was going to &s;it down him&s;elf, had not the latter whi&s;|pered him, that whatever pretence he might otherwi&s;e have had, he for&s;eited his claim to it, by coming in as one of the hi&s;torians. Lucan was &s;o exa&s;perated with the repul&s;e, that he muttered &s;omething to him&s;elf, and was heard to &s;ay, that &s;ince he could not have a &s;eat a|mong them him&s;elf, he would bring in one, who alone had more merit than their whole a&s;&s;embly: upon which he went to the door, and brought in Cato of Utica. That
<PB N="17" REF="20">
great man approached the company with &s;uch an air, that &s;hewed he contemned the honour which he laid a claim to. Ob&s;erving the &s;eat oppo&s;ite to Cae&s;ar was va|cant, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and &s;poke two or three &s;mart &s;entences upon the nature of precedency, which, according to him, con&s;i&s;ted not in place, but in intrin|&s;ic merit; to which he added, that the mo&s;t virtuous man, where-ever he was &s;eated, was always at the upper end of the table. Socrates, who had a great &s;pirit of raillery with his wi&s;dom, could not forbear &s;miling at a virtue which took &s;o little pains to make it&s;elf agreeable. Cicero took the occa&s;ion to make a long di&s;cour&s;e in prai&s;e of Cato, which he uttered with much vehemence. Cae&s;ar an&s;wered with a great deal of &s;eeming temper: but as I &s;tood at a great di&s;tance from them, I was not able to hear one word of what they &s;aid. But I could not forbear taking notice, that in all the di&s;cour&s;e which pa&s;&s;ed at the table, a word or a nod from Homer decided the controver&s;y.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort pau&s;e, Augu&s;tus appeared looking round him with a &s;erene and affable countenance upon all the writers of his age, who &s;trove among them&s;elves which of them &s;hould &s;how him the greate&s;t marks of gratitude and re&s;pect. Virgil ro&s;e from the table to meet him; and though he was an acceptable gue&s;t to all, he appear|ed more &s;uch to the learned, than the military worthies. The next man a&s;toni&s;hed the whole table with his ap|pearance: he was &s;low, &s;olemn, and &s;ilent in his beha|viour, and wore a raiment curiou&s;ly wrought with hie|roglyphics. As he came into the middle of the room, he threw back the &s;kirt of it, and di&s;covered a golden thigh. Socrates, at the &s;ight of it, declared again&s;t keeping company with any who were not made of fle&s;h and blood; and therefore de&s;ired Diogenes the Laertian to lead him to the apartment allotted for fabulous he|roes, and worthies of dubious exi&s;tence. At his going out, he told them, that they did not know whom they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; that he was now Pythagoras, the fir&s;t of
<PB N="18" REF="21">
philo&s;ophers, and that formerly he had been a brave man at the &s;iege of Troy. That may be very true, &s;aid Socrates; but you forget that you have likewi&s;e been a ve|ry great harlot in your time. This exclu&s;ion made way for Archimedes, who came forward with a &s;cheme of ma|thematical figures in his hand; among which, I ob|&s;erved a cone or cylinder.</P>
<P>Seeing this table full, I de&s;ired my guide for variety to lead me to the fabulous apartment, the roof of which was painted with gorgons, chimera's and centaurs, with many other emblematical figures, which I wanted both time and &s;kill to unriddle. The fir&s;t table was almo&s;t full. At the upper end &s;at Hercules, leaning an arm upon his club. On his right hand were Achilles and Uly&s;&s;es, and between them Aeneas. On his left were Hector, The&s;eus, and Ja&s;on. The lower end had Orpheus, Ae&s;op, Phalaris, and Mu&s;aeus. The u&s;hers &s;eemed at a lo&s;s for a twelfth man, when me|thought, to my great joy and &s;urprize, I heard &s;ome at the lower end of the table mention I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff: but tho&s;e of the upper end received it with di&s;dain, and &s;aid, if they mu&s;t have a Briti&s;h worthy, they would have Robin Hood.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Octob. 24.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE orders from Sir Harry Quick&s;et, of Staf|ford&s;hire, Bar. to acquaint you, that his honour Sir Harry him&s;elf, Sir Giles Wheelbarrow Kt.

I thought it pro|per to acquaint you before-hand &s;o many per&s;ons of quality came, that you might not be &s;urprized there|with.

<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Your mo&s;t humble &s;ervant, John Thrifty.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>I received this me&s;&s;age with le&s;s &s;urprize than I be|lieved Mr. Thrifty imagined; for I knew the good company too well to feel any palpitations at their ap|proach: but I was in very great concern how I &s;hould adju&s;t the ceremonial, and demean my&s;elf to all the&s;e great men, who perhaps had not &s;een any thing above them&s;elves for the&s;e twenty years la&s;t pa&s;t. I am &s;ure that is the ca&s;e of Sir Harry. Be&s;ides which, I was &s;en|&s;ible that there was a great point in adju&s;ting my beha|viour
<PB N="20" REF="23">
to the &s;imple '&s;quire, &s;o as to give him &s;atisfaction, and not di&s;oblige the ju&s;tice of the Quorum.</P>
<P>The hour of nine was come this morning, and I had no &s;ooner &s;et chairs (by the &s;teward's letter) and fixed my tea-equipage, but I heard a knock at my door, which was opened, but no one entered; after which followed a long &s;ilence, which was broke at la&s;t by, Sir, I beg your pardon; I think I know better: and another voice, Nay, good Sir Giles&mdash;I looked out from my window, and &s;aw the good company all with their hats off, and arms &s;pread, offering the door to each other. After many offers, they entered with much &s;olemnity, in the order Mr. Thrifty was &s;o kind as to name them to me. But they are now got to my chamber-door, and I &s;aw my old friend Sir Harry enter. I met him with all the re&s;pect due to &s;o reverend a vegetable: for you are to know, that is my &s;en&s;e of a per&s;on who remains idle in the &s;ame place for half a century. I got him with great &s;ucce&s;s into his chair by the fire, without throwing down any of my cups. The knight bachelor told me, he had a great re&s;pect for my whole family, and would, with my leave, place him&s;elf next to Sir Harry, at who&s;e right hand he had &s;at at every quarter|&s;e&s;&s;ions this thirty years, unle&s;s he was &s;ick. The &s;tew|ard in the rear whi&s;pered the young templer, that is true to my knowlege. I had the misfortune, as they &s;tood cheek by jole, to de&s;ire the '&s;quire to &s;it down be|fore the ju&s;tice of the Quorum, to the no &s;mall &s;atisfa|ction of the former, and re&s;entment of the latter: but I &s;aw my error too late, and got them as &s;oon as I could into their &s;eats. Well, &s;aid I, gentlemen, after I have told you how glad I am of this great honour, I am to de&s;ire you to drink a di&s;h of tea. They an&s;wered one and all, that they never drank tea in a morning. Not in a morning, &s;aid I! &s;taring round me. Upon which the pert jackanapes Nick Doubt tipped me the wink, and put out his tongue at his grandfather. Here followed a profound &s;ilence, when the &s;teward in his boots and
<PB N="21" REF="24">
whip propo&s;ed, we &s;hould adjourn to &s;ome public|hou&s;e, where every body might call for what they plea&s;|ed, and enter upon the bu&s;ine&s;s. We all &s;tood up in an in&s;tant, and Sir Harry filed off from the left very di&s;|creetly, countermarching behind the chairs towards the door: after him, Sir Giles in the &s;ame manner. The &s;imple '&s;quire made a &s;udden &s;tart to follow; but the ju&s;tice of the Quorum whipped between upon the &s;tand of the &s;tairs. A maid going up with coals made us halt, and put us into &s;uch confu&s;ion, that we &s;tood all in a heap, without any vi&s;ible po&s;&s;iblity of recovering our order: for the young jackanapes &s;eemed to make a je&s;t of this matter, and had &s;o contrived, by pre&s;&s;ing a|mong&s;t us under pretence of making way, that his grandfather was got into the middle, and he knew no|body was of quality to &s;tir a &s;tep, till Sir Harry moved fir&s;t. We were fixed in this perplexity for &s;ome time, till we heard a very loud noi&s;e in the &s;treet; and Sir Harry a&s;king what it was, I, to make them move, &s;aid it was fire. Upon this, all ran down as fa&s;t as they could, without order or ceremony, till we got into the &s;treet, where we drew up in very good order, and filed off down Sheer-Lane, the impertinent templer driving us before him, as in a &s;tring, and pointing to his ac|quaintance who pa&s;&s;ed by.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I love to u&s;e people according to their own &s;en&s;e of good breeding, and therefore whipped in between the ju&s;tice and the &s;imple '&s;quire. He could not properly take this ill; but I over-heard him whi&s;per the &s;teward, that he thought it hard that a common con|jurer &s;hould take place of him, though an elder '&s;quire. In this order we marched down Sheer-lane, at the upper end of which I lodge. When we came to Temple-Bar, Sir Harry and Sir Giles got over; but a run of coaches kept the re&s;t of us on this &s;ide the &s;treet: however we all at la&s;t landed, and drew up in very good order before Ben. Tooke's &s;hop, who favoured our rallying with great humanity. From hence we proceeded again, till
<PB N="22" REF="25">
we came to Dick's coffee-hou&s;e, where I de&s;igned to carry them. Here we were at our old difficulty, and took up the &s;treet upon the &s;ame ceremony. We pro|ceeded through the entry, and were &s;o nece&s;&s;arily kept in order by the &s;ituation, that we were now got into the coffee-hou&s;e it&s;elf, where, as &s;oon as we arrived, we repeated our civilities to each other; after which, we marched up to the high table, which has an a&s;cent to it inclo&s;ed in the middle of the room. The whole hou&s;e was alarmed at this entry, made up of per&s;ons of &s;o much &s;tate and ru&s;ticity. Sir Harry called for a mug of ale, and Dyer's letter. The boy brought the ale in an in&s;tant; but &s;aid, they did not take in the letter. No! (&s;ays Sir Harry;) then take back your mug; we are like indeed to have good liquor at this hou&s;e! Here the templer tipped me a &s;econd wink, and if I had not look|ed very grave upon him, I found he was di&s;po&s;ed to be very familiar with me. In &s;hort, I ob&s;erved, after a long pau&s;e, that the gentlemen did not care to enter up|on bu&s;ine&s;s till after their morning-draught, for which rea&s;on I called for a bottle of mum; and finding that had no effect upon them, I ordered a &s;econd, and a third: after which, Sir Harry reached over to me, and told me in a low voice, that the place was too public for bu&s;i|ne&s;s; but he would call upon me again to morrow|morning at my own lodgings, and bring &s;ome more friends with him.&mdash;<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this paper.</NOTE></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own apartment, <DATE>October 31.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>&mdash;I was this morning awaked by a &s;udden &s;hake of the hou&s;e; and as &s;oon as I had got a little out of my
<PB N="23" REF="26">
con&s;ternation, I felt another, which was followed by two or three repetitions of the &s;ame convul&s;ion. I got up as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, girt on my rapier, and &s;natched up my hat, when my landlady came up to me, and told me that the gentlewoman of the next hou&s;e begged me to &s;tep thither; for that a lodger &s;he had taken in was run mad, and &s;he de&s;ired my advice; as indeed every body in the whole lane does upon important occa&s;ions. I am not like &s;ome arti&s;ts, &s;aucy, becau&s;e I can be beneficial, but went immediately. Our neighbour told us, &s;he had the day before let her &s;econd floor to a very genteel youngi&s;h man, who told her, he kept extraordinary good hours, and was generally at home mo&s;t part of the morning and evening at &s;tudy; but that this morning he had for an hour together made this extravagant noi&s;e which we then heard. I went up &s;tairs with my hand upon the hilt of my rapier, and approached this new lodger's door. I looked in at the key-hole, and there I &s;aw a well-made man look with great attention on a book, and on a &s;udden, jump into the air &s;o high, that his head almo&s;t touched the cieling. He came down &s;afe on his right foot, and again flew up alighting on his left; then looked again at his book, and holding out his right leg, put it into &s;uch a quivering motion, that I thought he would have &s;haked it off. He u&s;ed the left after the &s;ame manner; when on a &s;udden, to my great &s;urprize, he &s;tooped him&s;elf incredibly low, and turned gently on his toes. After this circular motion, he con|tinued bent in that humble po&s;ture for &s;ome time, look|ing on his book. After this he recovered him&s;elf with a &s;udden &s;pring, and flew round the room in all the vio|lence and di&s;order imaginable, till he made a full pau&s;e for want of breath. In this interim my woman asked what I thought: I whi&s;pered, that I thought this learn|ed per&s;on an enthu&s;ia&s;t, who po&s;&s;ibly had his fir&s;t edu|cation in the Peripatetic way, which was a &s;ect of phi|lo&s;ophers who always &s;tudied when walking.

time to ma&s;ter him if he were di&s;ordered, and knocked at his door. I was &s;urprized to find him open it, and &s;ay with great civility, and good mien, that he hoped he had not di&s;turbed us. I believed him in a lucid inter|val, and de&s;ired he would plea&s;e to let me &s;ee his book. He did &s;o, &s;miling. I could not make any thing of it, and therefore asked in what language it was writ. He &s;aid, it was one he &s;tudied with great application; but it was his profe&s;&s;ion to teach it, and could not communi|cate his knowlege without a con&s;ideration. I an&s;wered, that I hoped he would hereafter keep his thoughts to him&s;elf; for his meditation this morming had co&s;t me three coffee di&s;hes, and a clean pipe. He &s;eemed con|cerned at that, and told me, he was a dancing-ma&s;ter, and had been reading a dance or two before he went out, which had been written by one who taught at an academy in France. He ob&s;erved me at a &s;tand, and went on to inform me, that now articulate motions, as well as founds, were expre&s;&s;ed by proper characters; and that there is nothing &s;o common as to communicate a dance by a letter. I be&s;eeched him hereafter to me|ditate in a ground-room, for that otherwi&s;e it would be impo&s;&s;ible for an arti&s;t of any other kind to live near him; and that I was &s;ure, &s;everal of his thoughts this morning would have &s;haken my &s;pectacles off my no&s;e, had I been my&s;elf at &s;tudy.</P>
<P>I then took my leave of this virtuo&s;o, and returned to my chamber, meditating on the various occupations of rational creatures.</P>

<P>&mdash;The joining of plea&s;ure and pain together in &s;uch devices, &s;eems to me the only pointed thought I
<PB N="25" REF="28">
ever read which is natural; and it mu&s;t have proceeded from its being the univer&s;al &s;en&s;e and experience of man|kind, that they have all &s;poken of it in the &s;ame manner. I have in my own reading remarked an hundred and three epigrams, fifty odes, and ninety one &s;entences, tending to this &s;ole purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is certain, there is no other pa&s;&s;ion which does pro|duce &s;uch contrary effects in &s;o great a degree: but this may he &s;aid for love, that if you &s;trike it out of the &s;oul, life would be in&s;ipid, and our being but half animated. Human nature would &s;ink into deadne&s;s and lethargy, if not quickened with &s;ome active principle; and as for all others, whether ambition, envy, or avarice, which are apt to po&s;&s;e&s;s the mind in the ab&s;ence of this pa&s;&s;ion, it mu&s;t be allowed that they have greater pains, without the compen&s;ation of &s;uch exqui&s;ite plea&s;ures as tho&s;e we find in love. The great &s;kill is to heighen the &s;atisfactions, and deaden the &s;orrows of it, which has been the end of many of my labours, and &s;hall continue to be &s;o for the &s;ervice of the world in general, and in particular of the fair &s;ex, who are always the be&s;t or the wor&s;t part of it. It is pity that a pa&s;&s;ion, which has in it a capacity of making life happy, &s;hould not be cultivated to the utmo&s;t advantage. Rea&s;on, prudence, and good-nature, rightly applied, can thoroughly accompli&s;h this great end, pro|vided they have always a real and con&s;tant love to work upon. But this &s;ubject I &s;hall treat more at large in the hi&s;tory of my married &s;i&s;ter; and in the mean time &s;hall conclude my reflection on the pains and plea&s;ures which attend this pa&s;&s;ion with one of the fine&s;t allegories which I think I have ever read. It is invented by the divine Plato, and to &s;how the opinion he him&s;elf had of it, a|&s;cribed by him to his admired Socrates, whom he repre|&s;ents as di&s;cour&s;ing with his friends, and giving the hi|&s;tory of Love in the following manner.</P>
<P>At the birth of Beauty, &s;ays he, there was a great fea&s;t made, and many gue&s;ts invited: among the re&s;t, was the god Plenty, who was the &s;on of the godde&s;s Prudence,
<PB N="26" REF="29">
and inherited many of his mother's virtues. After a full entertainment, he retired into the garden of Jupiter, which was hung with a great variety of ambro&s;ial fruits, and &s;eems to have been a very proper retreat for &s;uch a gue&s;t. In the mean time an unhappy female, called Poverty, hav|ing heard of this great fea&s;t, repaired to it in hopes of finding relief. The fir&s;t place &s;he lights upon was Jupi|ter's garden, which generally &s;tands open to people of all conditions. Poverty enters, and by chance finds the god Plenty a&s;leep in it. She was immediately fired with his charms, laid her&s;elf down by his &s;ide, and managed matters &s;o well that &s;he conceived a child by him. The world was very much in &s;u&s;pence upon the occa&s;ion, and could not imagine to them&s;elves what would be the na|ture of an infant that was to have its original from two &s;uch parents. At the la&s;t, the child appears; and who &s;hould it be but Love. This infant grew up, and proved in all his behaviour what he really was, a compound of oppo&s;ite beings. As he is the &s;on of Plenty, who was the offspring of Prudence, he is &s;ubtle, intriguing, full of &s;tra|tagems and devices; as the &s;on of Poverty, he is fawning, begging, &s;erenading, delighting to lie at a thre&s;hold, or beneath a window. By the father he is audacious, full of hopes, con&s;cious of merit, and therefore quick of re&s;ent|ment: by the mother, he is doubtful, timorous, mean|&s;pirited, fearful of offending, and abject in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions. In the &s;ame hour you may &s;ee him tran&s;ported with rap|tures, talking of immortal plea&s;ures, and appearing &s;atis|fied as a god; and immediately after, as the mortal mother prevails in his compo&s;ition, you hehold him pining, lan|gui&s;hing, de&s;pairing, dying.</P>
<P>I have been always wonderfully delighted with fables, allegories, and the like inventions, which the polite&s;t and the be&s;t in&s;tuctors of mankind have always made u&s;e of: they take off from the &s;everity of in&s;truction, and in|force it at the &s;ame time that they conceal it: the &s;up|po&s;ing Love to be conceived immediately after the birth of Beauty, the parentage of Plenty, and the incon&s;i&s;tency
<PB N="27" REF="30">
of this pa&s;&s;ion with it&s;elf &s;o naturally derived to it, are great ma&s;ter-&s;trokes in this fable; and if they fell into good hands, might furni&s;h out a more plea&s;ing canto than any in Spen&s;er.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BELIEVE this is the fir&s;t letter that was ever &s;ent you from the middle region, where I am at this pre&s;ent writing. Not to keep you in &s;u&s;pence, it comes to you from the top of the highe&s;t mountain in Switzerland, where I am now &s;hivering among the eter|nal fro&s;ts and &s;nows. I can &s;carce forbear dating it in December, though they call it the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t at the bottom of the mountain. I a&s;&s;ure you, I can hardly keep my ink from freezing in the middle of the dog|days. I am here entertained with the prettie&s;t variety of &s;now-pro&s;pects that you can imagine, and have &s;eve|ral pits of it before me that are very near as old as the mountain it&s;elf; for in this country, it is as la&s;ting as marble. I am now upon a &s;pot of it, which they tell me fell about the reign of Charlemain or king Pepin. The inhabitants of the country are as great curio&s;ities as the country it&s;elf: they generally hire them&s;elves out in their youth, and if they are mu&s;quet-proof till about fifty, they bring home the money they have got, and the limbs they have left, to pa&s;s the re&s;t of their time among their native mountains. One of the gentlemen of the place, who is come off with the lo&s;s of an eye only, told me by way of boa&s;t, that there were now &s;even wooden legs in his family: and that for the&s;e four generations, there had not been one in his line that car|ried a whole body with him to the grave. I believe you will think the &s;tile of this letter a little extraordi|nary; but the Rehear&s;al will tell you, that <HI>people in clouds mu&s;t not be confined to &s;peak &s;en&s;e;</HI> and I hope

<P>I had &s;everal hints and adverti&s;ements from unknown hands, that &s;ome, who are enemies to my labours, de&s;ign to demand the fa&s;hionable way of &s;atisfaction for the di&s;turbance my lucubrations have given them. I confe&s;s, as things now &s;tand, I do not know how to deny &s;uch inviters, and am preparing my&s;elf accordingly: I have bought pumps and files, and am every morning practi&s;|ing in my chamber. My neighbour, the dancing-ma&s;ter, has demanded of me, why I take this liberty, &s;ince I would not allow it him? But I an&s;wered, His was an act of an indifferent nature, and mine of nece&s;&s;ity. My late treati&s;es again&s;t duels have &s;o far di&s;obliged the frater|nity of the noble &s;cience of defence, that I can get none of them to &s;how me &s;o much as one pa&s;s. I am therefore obliged to learn by book, and have accordingly &s;everal volumes, wherein all the po&s;tures are exactly delineated. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am &s;hy of letting people &s;ee me at this exerci&s;e, becau&s;e of my flannel wai&s;tcoat, and my &s;pecta|cles, which I am forced to fix on, the better to ob&s;erve the po&s;ture of the enemy.</P>
<P>I have upon my chamber-walls, drawn at full length, the figures of all &s;orts of men, from eight foot to three foot two inches. Within this height I take it, that all the fighting men of Great Britain are comprehended. But as I pu&s;h, I make allowances for my being of a lank and &s;pare body, and have chalked out in every figure my own di|men&s;ions; for I &s;corn to rob any man of his life, or to take
<PB N="29" REF="32">
advantage of his breadth: therefore I pre&s;s purely in a line down from his no&s;e, and take no more of him to a&s;&s;ault, than he has of me: for to &s;peak impartially, if a lean fellow wounds a fat one in any part to the right or left, whether it be in carte or in tierce, beyond the dimen&s;ions of the &s;aid lean fellow's own breadth, I take it to be mur|der, and &s;uch a murder as is below a gentleman to com|mit. As I am &s;pare, I am al&s;o very tall, and behave my&s;elf with relation to that advantage with the &s;ame punctilio; and I am ready to &s;toop or &s;tand, according to the &s;tature of my adver&s;ary. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have had great &s;ucce&s;s this morning, and have hit every figure round the room in a mortal part, without receiving the lea&s;t hurt, except a little &s;cratch by falling on my face, in pu&s;hing at one at the lower end of my chamber; but I recovered &s;o quick, and jumped &s;o nimbly into my guard, that if he had been alive he could not have hurt me. It is confe&s;&s;ed, I have writ again&s;t duels with &s;ome warmth; but in all my di&s;cour&s;es, I have not ever &s;aid, that I knew how a gentleman could avoid a duel if he were provoked to it; and &s;ince that cu&s;tom is now become a law, I know nothing but the legi&s;lative power, with new animadver&s;ions upon it, can put us in a capacity of denying challenges, though we are afterwards hanged for it. But no more of this at pre|&s;ent. As things &s;tand, I &s;hall put up no more affronts; and I &s;hall be &s;o far from taking ill words, that I will not take ill looks. I therefore warn all young hot fel|lows, not to look hereafter more terrible than their neighbours; for if they &s;tare at me with their hats cock|ed higher than other people, I will not bear it. Nay I give warning to all people in general to look kindly at me; for I will bear no frowns, even from ladies; and if any woman pretends to look &s;cornfully at me, I &s;hall demand &s;atisfaction of the next of kin of the ma&s;culine gender.</P>

<P>HAVING &s;wept away prodigious multitudes in one of my late papers, and brought a great de&s;truction upon my own &s;pecies, I mu&s;t endeavour in this to rai&s;e fre&s;h recruits, and if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;upply the places of the unborn and the decea&s;ed. It is &s;aid of Xerxes, that when he &s;tood upon a hill, and &s;aw the whole country round him covered with his army, he bru&s;t out in tears, to think that not one of that multitude would be alive a hundred years after. For my part, when I take a &s;urvey of this populous city, I can &s;carce forbear weeping, to &s;ee how few of its inhabitants are now living. It was with this thought that I drew up my la&s;t bill of mortality, and en|deavoured to &s;et out in it the great number of per&s;ons who have peri&s;hed by a di&s;temper, commonly known by the name of idlene&s;s, which has long raged in the world, and de&s;troys more in every great town than the plague has done at Dantzick. To repair the mi&s;chief it has done, and &s;tock the world with a better race of mortals, I have more hopes of bringing to life tho&s;e that are young, than of reviving tho&s;e that are old. For which rea&s;on, I &s;hall here &s;et down that noble allegory which was written by an old author called Prodicus, but recommended and embelli&s;hed by Socrates. It is the de&s;cription of Virtue and Plea&s;ure, making their court to Hercules under the appearances of two beautiful women.</P>
<P>When Hercules, &s;ays the divine morali&s;t, was in that part of his youth in which it was natural for him to con|&s;ider what cour&s;e of life he ought to pur&s;ue, he one day
<PB N="31" REF="34">
retired into a de&s;art, where the &s;ilence and &s;olitude of the place very much favoured his meditations. As he was mu|&s;ing on his pre&s;ent condition, and very much perplexed in him&s;elf on the &s;tate of life he &s;hould chu&s;e, he &s;aw two women of a larger &s;tature than ordinary approaching towards him. One of them had a very noble air, and graceful deportment; her beauty was natural and ea&s;y, her per&s;on clean and un&s;potted, her eyes ca&s;t towards the ground with an agreeable re&s;erve, her motion and behavi|our full of mode&s;ty, and her raiment as white as &s;now. The other had a great deal of health and floridne&s;s in her countenance, which &s;he had helped with an artificial white and red, and endeavoured to appear more graceful than ordinary in her mein, by a mixture of affectation in all her ge&s;tures. She had a wonderful confidence and a&s;&s;u|rance in her looks, and all the variety of colours in her dre&s;s that &s;he thought were the mo&s;t proper to &s;how her complexion to an advantage. She ca&s;t her eyes upon her&s;elf, then turned them on tho&s;e that were pre&s;ent, to &s;ee how they liked her, and often looked on the figure &s;he made in her own &s;hadow. Upon her nearer approach to Hercules, &s;he &s;tepped before the other lady, who came forward with a regular compo&s;ed carriage, and running up to him, acco&s;ted him after the following manner.</P>
<P>My dear Hercules, &s;ays &s;he, I find you are very much divided in your own thoughts upon the way of life that you ought to chu&s;e: be my friend, and follow me; I will lead you into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ure, and out of the reach of pain, and remove you from all the noi&s;e and di&s;quietude of bu&s;ine&s;s. The affairs of either war or peace &s;hall have no power to di&s;turb you. Your whole employ|ment &s;hall be to make your life ea&s;y, and to entertain eve|ry &s;en&s;e with its proper gratification. Sumptuous tables, beds of ro&s;es, clouds of perfumes, concerts of mu&s;ic, crouds of beauties, are all in a readine&s;s to receive you. Come along with me into this region of delights, this world of plea&s;ure, and bid farewel for ever to care, to pain, to bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="35">
Hercules, hearing the lady talk after this manner, de|&s;ired to know her name; to which &s;he an&s;wered, my friends, and tho&s;e who are well acquainted with me, call me Happine&s;s; but my enemies, and tho&s;e who would injure my reputation, have given me the name of Plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>By this time the other lady was come up, who ad|dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to the young hero in a very different manner.</P>
<P>Hercules, &s;ays &s;he, I offer my&s;elf to you, becau&s;e I know you are de&s;cended from the gods, and give proofs of that de&s;cent by your love to virtue, and application to the &s;tudies proper for your age. This makes me hope you will gain both for your&s;elf and me an immortal re|putation. But before I invite you into my &s;ociety and friend&s;hip, I will be open and &s;incere with you, and mu&s;t lay down this as an e&s;tabli&s;hed truth, that there is no|thing truly valuable which can be purcha&s;ed without pains and labour. The gods have &s;et a price upon every real and noble plea&s;ure. If you would gain the favour of the deity, you mu&s;t be at the pains of wor&s;hipping him; if the friend&s;hip of good men, you mu&s;t &s;tudy to oblige them; if you would be honoured by your country, you mu&s;t take care to &s;erve it. In &s;hort, if you would be emi|nent in war or peace, you mu&s;t become ma&s;ter of all the qualifications that can make you &s;o. The&s;e are the only terms and conditions upon which I can propo&s;e happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The godde&s;s of Plea&s;ure here broke in upon her di&s;|cour&s;e: you &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, Hercules, by her own confe&s;&s;ion, the way to her plea&s;ure is long and difficult, whereas that which I propo&s;e is &s;hort and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Alas! &s;aid the other lady, who&s;e vi&s;age glowed with a pa&s;&s;ion, made up of &s;corn and pity, what are the plea|&s;ures you propo&s;e? To eat before you are hungry, drink before you are athir&s;t, &s;leep before you are tired, to gratify appetites before they are rai&s;ed, and rai&s;e &s;uch appetites as nature never planted. You never heard the mo&s;t de|licious
<PB N="33" REF="36">
mu&s;ic, which is the prai&s;e of one's &s;elf; nor &s;aw the mo&s;t beautiful object, which is the work of one's own hands. Your votaries pa&s;s away their youth in a dream of mi&s;taken plea&s;ures, while they are hoarding up angui&s;h, torment, and remor&s;e for old-age. As for me, I am the friend of gods and of good men, an agreeable companion to the artizan, an hou&s;hold guardian to the fathers of families, a patron and protector of &s;ervants, and a&s;&s;ociate in all true and generous friend&s;hips. The banquets of my votaries are never co&s;tly, but always delicious; for none eat or drink at them who are not invited by hunger and thir&s;t. Their &s;lumbers are &s;ound, and their wakings chear|ful. My young men have the plea&s;ure of hearing them|&s;elves prai&s;ed by tho&s;e who are in years; and tho&s;e who are in years, of being honoured by tho&s;e who are young. In a word, my followers are favoured by the gods, be|loved by their acquaintance, e&s;teemed by their country, and, after the clo&s;e of their labours, honoured by po|&s;terity.</P>
<P>We know, by the life of this memorable hero, to which of the&s;e two ladies he gave up his heart; and I be|lieve, every one who reads this will do him the ju&s;tice to approve his choice.</P>
<P>I very much admire the &s;peeches of the&s;e ladies, as con|taining in them the chief arguments for a life of virtue, or a life of plea&s;ure, that could enter into the thoughts of an heathen; but am particularly plea&s;ed with the dif|ferent figures he gives the two godde&s;&s;es. Our modern authors have repre&s;ented Plea&s;ure or Vice with an al|luring face, but ending in &s;nakes and mon&s;ters: here &s;he appears in all the charms of beauty, though they are all fal&s;e and borrowed; and by that means, compo&s;es a vi&s;i|on entirely natural and plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>I have tran&s;lated this allegory for the benefit of the youth of Great Britain; and particularly of tho&s;e who are &s;till in the deplorable &s;tate of non-exi&s;tence, and whom I mo&s;t earne&s;tly intreat to come into the world. Let my embrios &s;how the lea&s;t inclination to any &s;ingle virtue,
<PB N="34" REF="37">
and I &s;hall allow it to be a &s;truggling towards birth. I do not expect of them, that, like the hero in the fore|going &s;tory, they &s;hould go about as &s;oon as they are born, with a club in their hands, and a lion's &s;kin on their &s;houlders, to root out mon&s;ters, and de&s;troy tyrants; but, as the fine&s;t author of all antiquity has &s;aid upon this very occa&s;ion, though a man has not the abilities to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in the mo&s;t &s;hining parts of a great character, he has certainly the capacity of being ju&s;t, faith|ful, mode&s;t, and temperate.</P>

<P>I WAS la&s;t week taking a &s;olitary walk in the garden of Lincolns-Inn, a favour that is indulged me by &s;everal of the benchers who are my intimate friends, and grown old with me in this neighbourhood, when, according to the nature of men in years, who have made but little progre&s;s in the advancement of their fortune or their fame, I was repining at the &s;udden ri&s;e many per&s;ons who are my juniors, and indeed at the unequal di&s;tribution of wealth, honour, and all other ble&s;&s;ings of life. I was lo&s;t in this thought when the night came upon me, and drew my mind into a far more agreeable contemplation. The heaven above me appeared in all its glories, and pre&s;ent|ed me with &s;uch an hemi&s;phere of &s;tars, as made the mo&s;t agreeable pro&s;pect imaginable to one who delights in the &s;tudy of nature. It happened to be a freezing night, which had purified the whole body of air into &s;uch a bright tran|&s;parent aether, as made every con&s;tellation vi&s;ible; and at the &s;ame time gave &s;uch a particular glowing to the &s;tars, that I thought it the riche&s;t &s;ky I had ever &s;een. I could not behold a &s;cene &s;o wonderfully adorned and lighted up, if I may be allowed that expre&s;&s;ion, with|out
<PB N="35" REF="38">
&s;uitable meditations on the author of &s;uch illu&s;trious and amazing objects. For on the&s;e occa&s;ions, philo&s;ophy &s;ugge&s;ts motives to religion, and religion adds plea&s;ures to philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had recovered my u&s;ual temper and &s;ere|nity of &s;oul, I retired to my lodgings with the &s;atisfaction of having pa&s;&s;ed away a few hours in the proper employ|ments of a rea&s;onable creature, and promi&s;ing my&s;elf that my &s;lumbers would be &s;weet. I no &s;ooner fell into them, but I dreamed a dream, or &s;aw a vi&s;ion, for I know not which to call it, that &s;eemed to ri&s;e out of my evening-meditation, and had &s;omething in it &s;o &s;olemn and &s;erious, that I cannot forbear communicating it; though I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the wildne&s;s of imagination, which in a dream is always loo&s;e and irregular, di&s;covers it&s;elf too much in &s;everal parts of it.</P>
<P>Methoughts I &s;aw the azure &s;ky diver&s;ified with the &s;ame glorious luminaries which had entertained me a little before I fell a&s;leep. I was looking very attentively on that &s;ign in the heavens which is called by the name of the Balance, when on a &s;udden there appeared in it an extra|ordinary light, as if the &s;un &s;hould ri&s;e at midnight. By its increa&s;ing in breadth and lu&s;tre, I &s;oon found that it approached towards the earth; and at length could di&s;|cern &s;omething like a &s;hadow hovering in the mid&s;t of a great glory, which in a little time after I di&s;tinctly per|ceived to be the figure of a woman. I fancied at fir&s;t it might have been the angel or intelligence that guided the con&s;tellation from which it de&s;cended; but upon a nearer view, I &s;aw about her all the emblems with which the godde&s;s of Ju&s;tice is u&s;ually de&s;cribed. Her countenance was un&s;peakably awful and maje&s;tic, but exqui&s;itely beautiful to tho&s;e who&s;e eyes were &s;trong enough to be|hold it; her &s;miles tran&s;ported with rapture, her frowns terrified to de&s;pair. She held in her hand a mirror, en|dued with the &s;ame qualities as that which the painters put into the hand of Truth.</P>
<P>There &s;treamed from it a light, which di&s;tingui&s;hed it|&s;elf
<PB N="36" REF="39">
from all the &s;plendors that &s;urrounded her, more than a fla&s;h of lightning &s;hines in the mid&s;t of day-light. As &s;he moved it in her hand, it brightened the heavens, the air, or the earth. When &s;he had de&s;cended &s;o low as to be &s;een and heard by mortals, to make the pomp of her appearance more &s;upportable, &s;he threw darkne&s;s and clouds about her, that tempered the light into a thou&s;and beautiful &s;hades and colours, and multiplied that lu&s;tre, which was before too &s;trong and dazling, into a variety of milder glories.</P>
<P>In the mean time the world was in an alarm, and all the inhabitants of it gathered together upon a &s;pacious plain; &s;o that I &s;eemed to have all the &s;pecies before my eyes. A voice was heard from the clouds, declaring the intention of this vi&s;it, which was to re&s;tore and ap|propriate to every one living what was his due. The fear and hope, joy and &s;orrow, which appeared in that great a&s;&s;embly after this &s;olemn declaration, are not to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed. The fir&s;t edict was then pronounced, <HI>That all titles and claims to riches and e&s;tates, or to any part of them, &s;hould be immediately ve&s;ted in the rightful owner.</HI> Upon this, the inhabitants of the earth held up the in&s;truments of their tenure, whether in parchment, paper, wax, or any other form of conveyance; and as the godde&s;s moved the mirror of Truth which &s;he held in her hand, &s;o that the light which flowed from it fell upon the multitude, they examined the &s;everal in&s;truments by the beams of it. The rays of this mirror had a particular quality of &s;etting fire to all forgery and fal&s;hood. The blaze of pa|pers, the melting of &s;eals, and crackling of parchments, made a very odd &s;cene. The fire very often ran through two or three lines only, and then &s;topped; though I could not but ob&s;erve, that the flame chiefly broke out among the interlineations and codicils. The light of the mirror, as it was turned up and down, pierced into all the dark cor|ners and rece&s;&s;es of the univer&s;e, and by that means de|tected many writings and records which had been hidden or buried by time, chance, or de&s;ign. This occa&s;ioned
<PB N="37" REF="40">
a wonderful revolution among the people. At the &s;ame time, the &s;poils of extortion, fraud, and robbery, with all the fruits of bribery and corruption, were thrown together into a prodigious pile, that almo&s;t reached to the clouds, and was called the Mount of Re&s;titution; to which all in|jured per&s;ons were invited, to receive what belonged to them.</P>
<P>One might &s;ee crouds of people in tattered garments come up, and change clothes with others that were dre&s;|&s;ed with lace and embroidery. Several who were Plumbs, or very near it, became men of moderate fortunes; and many others, who were overgrown in wealth and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, had no more le&s;t than what they u&s;ually &s;pent. What moved my concern mo&s;t, was, to &s;ee a certain &s;treet of the greate&s;t credit in Europe from one end to the other become bankrupt.</P>
<P>The next command was, for the whole body of man|kind to &s;eparate them&s;elves into their proper families; which was no &s;ooner done, but an edict was i&s;&s;ued out, requiring all children <HI>to repair to their true and natural fathers.</HI> This put a great part of the a&s;&s;embly in motion; for as the mirror was moved over them, it in&s;pired eve|ry one with &s;uch a natural in&s;tinct, as directed them to their real parents. It was a very melancholy &s;pectacle to &s;ee the fathers of very large families become childle&s;s, and bachelors undone by a charge of &s;ons and daughters. You might &s;ee a pre&s;umptive heir of a great e&s;tate a&s;k ble&s;|&s;ing of his coachman, and a celebrated toa&s;t paying her duty to a valet de chambre. Many under vows of celi|bacy appeared &s;orrounded with a numerous i&s;&s;ue. This change of parentage would have cau&s;ed great lamentation, but that the calamity was pretty common; and that ge|nerally tho&s;e who lo&s;t their children, had the &s;atisfacti|on of &s;ceing them put into the hands of their deare&s;t friends. Men were no &s;ooner &s;ettled in their right to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and their progeny, but there was a third order proclaimed, <HI>That all the po&s;ts of dignity and honour in the univer&s;e &s;hould be conferred on per&s;ons of the greate&s;t</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="41">
<HI>merit, abilities and perfection.</HI> The hand&s;ome, the &s;trong and the wealthy, immediately pre&s;&s;ed forward; but not being able to bear the &s;plendor of the mirror which play|ed upon their faces, they immediately fell back among the croud: but as the godde&s;s tried the multitude by her gla&s;s, as the eagle does its young ones by the lu&s;tre of the &s;un, it was remarkable, that every one turned a|way his face from it who had not di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf either by virtue, knowlege or capacity in bu&s;ine&s;s, either military, or civil. This &s;elect a&s;&s;embly was drawn up in the centre of a prodigious multitude, which was diffu&s;|ed on all &s;ides, and &s;tood ob&s;erving them, as idle people u&s;e to gather about a regiment that are exerci&s;ing their arms. They were drawn up in three bodies: in the fir&s;t were the men of virtue; in the &s;econd, men of know|lege; and in the third, the men of bu&s;ine&s;s. It was im|po&s;&s;ible to look at the fir&s;t column without a &s;ecret ve|neration, their a&s;pects were &s;o &s;weetened with humanity, rai&s;ed with contemplation, emboldened with re&s;olution, and adorned with the mo&s;t agreeable airs, which are tho&s;e that proceed from &s;ecret habits of virtue. I could not but take notice, that there were many faces among them which were unknown, not only to the multitude, but even to &s;everal of their own body.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd column, con&s;i&s;ting of the men of know|lege, there had been great di&s;putes before they fell into the ranks, which they did not do at la&s;t, without po&s;itive command of the godde&s;s who pre&s;ided over the a&s;&s;em|bly. She had &s;o ordered it, that men of the greate&s;t geni|us and &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e were placed at the head of the column: behind the&s;e, were &s;uch as had formed their minds very much on the thoughts and writings of o|thers. In the rear of the column, were men who had more wit than &s;en&s;e, or more learning than under&s;tanding. All living authors of any value were ranged in one of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was very much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a great body of editors, critics, commentators, and grammarians, meet with &s;o very ill a reception. They
<PB N="39" REF="42">
had formed them&s;elves into a body, and with a great deal of arrogance demanded the fir&s;t &s;tation in the column of knowlege; but the godde&s;s, in&s;tead of complying with their reque&s;t, clapped them all into liveries, and bid them know them&s;elves for no other but lacqueys of the learned.</P>
<P>The third column were men of bu&s;ine&s;s, and con&s;i&s;t|ing of per&s;ons in military and civil capacities. The for|mer marched out from the re&s;t, and placed them&s;elves in the front, at which the others &s;hook their heads at them, but did not think fit to di&s;pute the po&s;t with them. I could not but make &s;everal ob&s;evations upon this la&s;t column of people; but I have certain private rea&s;ons why I do not think fit to communicate them to the pub|lic. In order to fill up all the po&s;ts of honour, dignity, and profit, there was a draught made out of each co|lumn, of men who were ma&s;ters of all three qualificati|ons in &s;ome degree, and were preferred to &s;tations of the fir&s;t rank. The &s;econd draught was made out of &s;uch as were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any two of the qualifications, who were di&s;po&s;ed of in &s;tations of a &s;econd dignity. Tho&s;e who were left, and were endued only with one of them, had their &s;uitable po&s;ts. When this was over, there re|mained many places of tru&s;t and profit unfilled, for which there were fre&s;h draughts made out of the &s;urrounding multitude, who had any appearance of the&s;e excellencies, or were recommended by tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them in re|ality.</P>
<P>All were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o many new faces in the mo&s;t eminent dignities; and for my own part, I was ve|ry well plea&s;ed to &s;ee that all my friends either kept their pre&s;ent po&s;ts, or were advanced to higher.</P>
<P>Having filled my paper with tho&s;e particulars of man|kind, I mu&s;t re&s;erve for another occa&s;ion the &s;equel of it, which relates to the fair &s;ex.</P>

<P>THE progre&s;s of my intended account of what hap|pened when Ju&s;tice vi&s;ited mortals, is at pre&s;ent in|terrupted by the ob&s;ervation and &s;en&s;e of an inju&s;tice a|gain&s;t which there is no remedy, even in a kingdom more happy in the care taken of the liberty and property of the &s;ubject, than any other nation upon earth. This iniquity is committed by a mo&s;t impregnable &s;et of mor|tals, men who are rogues within the law; and in the very commi&s;&s;ion of what they are guilty of, profe&s;&s;edly own, that they forbear no injury but from the terror of being puni&s;hed for it. The&s;e mi&s;creants are a &s;et of wretch|es we authors call pirates, who print any book, poem, or &s;ermon, as &s;oon as it appears in the world, in a &s;mal|ler volume, and &s;ell it, as all other thieves do &s;tolen goods, at a cheaper rate. I was in my rage calling them ra&s;cals, plunderers, robbers, highway-men&mdash;But they acknow|lege all that, and are plea&s;ed with tho&s;e as well as any other titles; nay, will print them them&s;elves to turn the peny.</P>
<P>I am extremely at a lo&s;s how to act again&s;t &s;uch open enemies, who have not &s;hame enough to be touched with our reproaches, and are as well defended again&s;t what we can &s;ay, as what we can do. Railing therefore we mu&s;t turn into complaint, which I cannot forbear making, when I con&s;ider that all the labours of my long life may be di&s;appointed by the fir&s;t man that plea&s;es to rob me. I had flattered my&s;elf, that my &s;tock of learning was worth 150 l. per annum, which would very hand&s;omely maintain me and my little family, who are &s;o happy or &s;o wi&s;e as to want only nece&s;&s;aries. Before men had come up
<PB N="41" REF="44">
to this bare-faced impudence, it was an e&s;tate to have a competency of under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>An ingenious drole, who is &s;ince dead, and indeed it is well for him he is &s;o, for he mu&s;t have &s;tarved had he lived to this day, u&s;ed to give me an account of his good hu&s;bandry in the management of his learning. He was a general dealer, and had his amu&s;ements as well comical as &s;erious. The merry rogue &s;aid, when he wanted a dinner, he writ a paragraph of table-talk, and his book&s;eller upon &s;ight paid the reckoning. He was a very good judge of what would plea&s;e the people, and could aptly hit both the genius of his readers, and the &s;ea&s;on of the year in his writings. His brain, which was his e&s;tate, had as regular and different produce as other mens land. From the beginning of November till the o|pening of the campagne, he writ pamphlets and letters to members of parliament, or friends in the country: but &s;ometimes he would relieve his ordinary readers with a murder, and lived comfortably a week or two upon &s;trange and lamentable accidents. A little before the armies took the field, his way was to open your attention with a prodigy; and a mon&s;ter well writ, was two guineas the lowe&s;t price. This prepared his readers for his great and bloody news from Flanders in June and July. Poor Tom! He is gone&mdash;But I ob&s;erved, he always looked well after a battle, and was apparently fatter in a fighting year. Had this hone&s;t carele&s;s fellow lived till now, fa|mine had &s;tared him in the face, and interrupted his mer|riment; as it mu&s;t be a &s;olid affliction to all tho&s;e who&s;e pen is their portion.</P>
<P>As for my part, I do not &s;peak wholly for my own &s;ake in this point; for palmi&s;try and a&s;trology will bring me in greater gains than the&s;e my papers; &s;o that I am only in the condition of a lawyer, who leaves the bar for chamber-practice. However, I may be allowed to &s;peak in the cau&s;e of learning it&s;elf, and lament, that a liberal education is the only one which a polite nation makes unprofitable. All mechanic artizans are allowed
<PB N="42" REF="45">
to reap the fruit of their invention and ingenuity with|out inva&s;ion; but he that has &s;eparated him&s;elf from the re&s;t of mankind, and &s;tudied the wonders of the creation, the government of his pa&s;&s;ions, and the revolutions of the world, and has an ambition to communicate the effect of half his life &s;pent in &s;uch noble enquiries, has no pro|perty in what he is willing to produce, but is expo&s;ed to robbery and want, with this melancholy and ju&s;t reflection, that he is the only man who is not protected by his country, at the &s;ame time that he be&s;t de&s;erves it.</P>
<P>According to the ordinary rules of computation, the greater the adventure is, the greater ought to be the pro|fit of tho&s;e who &s;ucceed in it; and by this mea&s;ure, none have pretence of turning their labours to greater advan|tage than per&s;ons brought up to letters. A learned edu|cation, pa&s;&s;ing through great &s;chools and univer&s;ities, is very expen&s;ive, and con&s;umes a moderate fortune before it is gone through in its proper forms. The purcha&s;e of an hand&s;ome commi&s;&s;ion or employment, which would give a man a good figure in another kind of life, is to be made at a much cheaper rate. Now, if we con&s;ider this expen&s;ive voyage which is undertaken in the &s;earch of knowlege, and how few there are who take in any con|&s;iderable merchandi&s;e, how le&s;s frequent it is to be able to turn what men have gained into profit: how hard is it, that the very &s;mall number who are di&s;tingui&s;hed with abilities to know how to vend their wares, and have the good fortune to bring them into port, &s;hould &s;uffer being plundered by privateers under the very cannon that &s;hould protect them! The mo&s;t eminent and u&s;eful author of the age we live in, after having laid out a princely re|venue in works of charity and beneficence, as became the greatne&s;s of his mind, and the &s;anctity of his cha|racter, would have left the per&s;on in the world who was the deare&s;t to him in a narrow condition, had not the &s;ale of his immortal writings brought her in a very con&s;ider|able dowry; though it was impo&s;&s;ible for it to be equal to their value. Every one will know, that I here mean the
<PB N="43" REF="46">
works of the late archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the copy of which was &s;old for 2500 l.</P>
<P>I do not &s;peak with relation to any party; but it has happened, and may often &s;o happen, that men of great learning and virtue cannot qualify them&s;elves for being employed in bu&s;ine&s;s, or receiving preferments. In this ca&s;e, you cut them off from all &s;upport, if you take from them the benefit that may ari&s;e from their writings. For my own part, I have brought my&s;elf to con&s;ider things in &s;o unprejudiced a manner, that I e&s;teem more a man who can live by the product of his under&s;tanding, than one who does it by the favour of great men.</P>
<P>The zeal of an author has tran&s;ported me thus far, though I think my &s;elf as much concerned in the capaci|ty of a reader. If this practice goes on, we mu&s;t never expect to &s;ee again a beautiful edition of a book in Great Britain.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een the memoirs of Sir William Temple publi&s;hed in the &s;ame character and volume with the hi&s;tory of Tom Thumb, and the works of our greate&s;t poets &s;hrunk into peny books and garlands. For my own part, I expect to &s;ee my lucubrations printed on browner paper then they are at pre&s;ent; and if the humour continues, mu&s;t be forced to retrench my expen&s;ive way of living, and not &s;moke above two pipes a day.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A continuation of the Vi&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>THE male world were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the godde&s;s of Ju|&s;tice, and di&s;appeared, when on a &s;udden the whole plain was covered with women. So charming a mul|titude filled my heart with un&s;peakable plea&s;ure; and
<PB N="44" REF="47">
as the cele&s;tial light of the mirror &s;hone upon their faces, &s;everal of them &s;eemed rather per&s;ons that de&s;cended in the train of the godde&s;s, than &s;uch who were brought be|fore her to their trial. The clack of tongues, and confu|&s;ion of voices, in this new a&s;&s;embly, was &s;o very great, that the godde&s;s was forced to command &s;ilence &s;everal times, and with &s;ome &s;everity, before &s;he could make them attentive to her edicts. They were all &s;en&s;ible, that the mo&s;t important affair among womankind was then to be &s;ettled, which every one knows to be the point of place. This had rai&s;ed innumerable di&s;putes among them, and put the whole &s;ex into a tumult. Every one produced her claim, and pleaded her preten&s;ions. Birth, beauty, wit, or wealth, were words that rung in my ears from all parts of the plain. Some boa&s;ted of the merit of their husbands; others of their own power in governing them. Some pleaded their un&s;potted virginity; others their nu|merous i&s;&s;ue. Some valued them&s;elves as they were the mothers, and others as they were the daughters, of con|&s;iderable per&s;ons. There was not a &s;ingle accompli&s;hment unmentioned, or unpracti&s;ed. The whole congregation was full of &s;inging, dancing, to&s;&s;ing, ogling, &s;queaking, &s;miling, &s;ighing, fanning, frowning, and all tho&s;e irre&s;i&s;tible arts which women put in practice, to captivate the hearts of rea&s;onable creatures. The godde&s;s, to end this di&s;pute, cau&s;ed it to be proclaimed, <HI>That every one &s;hould take place according as &s;he was more or le&s;s beautiful.</HI> This declarati|on gave great &s;atisfaction to the whole a&s;&s;embly, which immediately bridled up, and appeared in all its beauties. Such as believed them&s;elves graceful in their motion, found an occa&s;ion of falling back, advancing forward, or making a fal&s;e &s;tep, that they might &s;how their per&s;ons in the mo&s;t becoming air. Such as had fine necks and bo&s;oms, were wonderfully curious to look over the heads of the multitude, and ob&s;erve the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the a&s;&s;embly. Several clapped their hands on their forheads, as helping their &s;ight to look upon the glories that &s;urrounded the godde&s;s, but in reality to &s;how
<PB N="45" REF="48">
fine hands and arms. The ladies were yet better plea&s;ed when they heard, that in the deci&s;ion of this great con|trover&s;y, each of them &s;hould be her own judge, and take her place according to her own opinion of her&s;elf, when &s;he con&s;ulted her looking-gla&s;s.</P>
<P>The godde&s;s then let down the mirror of truth in a golden chain, which appeared larger in proportion as it de&s;cended and approached nearer to the eyes of the be|holders. It was particular property of this looking-gla&s;s to bani&s;h all fal&s;e appearances, and &s;how people what they are. The whole woman was repre&s;ented, without regard to the u&s;ual external features, which were made entirely conformable to their real characters. In &s;hort, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed, taking in the whole circle of female per|fections, were the mo&s;t beautiful; and the mo&s;t defective, the mo&s;t deformed. The godde&s;s &s;o varied the motion of the gla&s;s, and placed it in &s;o many different lights, that each had an opportunity of &s;eeing her&s;elf in it.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the rage, the plea&s;ure, or a&s;toni&s;hment, that appeared in each face upon its repre|&s;entation in the mirror: multitudes &s;tarted at their own form, and would have broke the gla&s;s if they could have reached it. Many &s;aw their blooming features wither as they looked upon them, and their &s;elf-admiration turned into a loathing and abhorrence. The lady who was thought &s;o agreeable in her anger, and was &s;o often celebrated for a woman of fire and &s;pirit, was frighted at her own image, and fancied &s;he &s;aw a fury in the gla&s;s. The intere&s;ted mi&s;tre&s;s beheld a harpy, and the &s;ubtle jilt a &s;phinx. I was very much troubled in my own heart, to &s;ee &s;uch a de&s;truction of fine faces; but at the &s;ame time had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing &s;everal improved, which I had before looked upon as the greate&s;t ma&s;ter-pieces of nature. I ob&s;erved that &s;ome few were &s;o humble as to be &s;urpri&s;ed at their own charms; and that many a one who had lived in the retirement and &s;everity of a ve&s;tal, &s;hin|ed forth in all the graces and attractions of a &s;yren. I was ravi&s;hed at the &s;ight of a particular image in the mir|ror,
<PB N="46" REF="49">
which I think the mo&s;t beautiful object that my eyes ever beheld. There was &s;omething more than human in her countenance. Her eyes were &s;o full of light, that they &s;eemed to beautify every thing they looked upon. Her face was enlivened with &s;uch a florid bloom, as did not &s;o properly &s;eem the mark of health, as of immortali|ty. Her &s;hape, her &s;tature, and her mein, were &s;uch as di|&s;tingui&s;hed her even there where the whole fair &s;ex was a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>I was impatient to &s;ee the lady repre&s;ented by &s;o di|vine an image, whom I found to be the per&s;on that &s;tood at my right hand, and in the &s;ame point of view with my&s;elf. This was a little old woman, who in her prime had been about five foot high, though at pre&s;ent &s;hrunk to about three quarters of that mea&s;ure. Her natu|ral a&s;pect was puckered up with wrinkles, and her head covered with grey hairs. I had ob&s;erved all along an in|nocent chearfulne&s;s in her face, which was now height|ened into rapture as &s;he beheld her&s;elf in the gla&s;s. It was an odd circum&s;tance in my dream, but I cannot for|bear relating it, I conceived &s;o great an inclination to|wards her, that I had thoughts of di&s;cour&s;ing her upon the point of marriage, when on a &s;udden &s;he was carried from me: for the word was now given, that all who were plea&s;ed with their own images, &s;hould &s;eparate, and place them&s;elves at the head of their &s;ex.</P>
<P>This detachment was afterwards divided into three bodies, con&s;i&s;ting of maids, wives, and widows; the wives being placed in the middle, with the maids on the right, and the widows on the left; though it was with difficulty that the&s;e two la&s;t bodies were hindered from falling in|to the centre. This &s;eparation of tho&s;e, who liked their real &s;elves, not having le&s;&s;ened the number of the main body &s;o con&s;iderably as it might have been wi&s;hed, the godde&s;s, after having drawn up her mirror, thought fit to make new di&s;tinctions among tho&s;e who did not like the figure which they &s;aw in it. She made &s;everal whol&s;ome edicts, which are &s;lipt out of my mind; but there were two

which dwelt upon me, as being very extraordinary in their kind, and executed with great &s;everity. Their de&s;ign was, to make an example of two extremes in the female world; of tho&s;e who are very &s;evere on the conduct of o|thers, and of tho&s;e who are very regardle&s;s of their own. The fir&s;t &s;entence therefore the godde&s;s pronounced, was, <HI>That all females addicted to con&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s and detraction, &s;hould lo&s;e the u&s;e of &s;peech;</HI> a puni&s;hment which would be the mo&s;t grievous to the offender, and, what &s;hould be the end of all puni&s;hments, effectual for rooting out the crime. Upon this edict, which was as &s;oon execut|ed as publi&s;hed, the noi&s;e of the a&s;&s;embly very con&s;ide|rably abated. It was a melancholy &s;pectacle, to &s;ee &s;o many who had the reputation of rigid virtue &s;truck dumb. A lady who &s;tood by me, and &s;aw my concern, told me, &s;he wondered how I could be concerned for &s;uch a pack of&mdash;I found, by the &s;haking of her head, &s;he was going to give me their characters; but by her &s;aying no more, I perceived &s;he had lo&s;t the command of her tongue. This calamity fell very heavy upon that part of women who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Prudes, a courtly word for female hypocrites, who have a &s;hort way to being virtuous, by &s;howing that others are vicious. The &s;econd &s;entence was then pronounced again&s;t the loo&s;e part of the &s;ex, <HI>That all &s;hould immediately be preg|nant, who in any part of their lives had ran the hazard of it.</HI> This produced a very goodly appearance, and reveal|ed &s;o many mi&s;conducts, that made tho&s;e who were lately &s;truck dumb, repine more than ever at their want of ut|terance, though at the &s;ame time, as afflictions &s;eldom come &s;ingle, many of the mutes were al&s;o &s;eized with this new calamity. The ladies were now in &s;uch a con|dition, that they would have wanted room, had not the plain been large enough to let them divide their ground, and extend their lines on all &s;ides. It was a &s;en&s;ible affliction to me, to &s;ee &s;uch a multitude of fair ones either dumb or big-bellied: but I was &s;omething more at ea&s;e, when I &s;ound that they agreed upon &s;everal regu|lations

to cover &s;uch misfortunes. Among others that it &s;hould be an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim in all nations, that a wo|man's fir&s;t child might come into the world within &s;ix months after her acquaintance with her hu&s;band; and that grief might retard the birth of her la&s;t till fourteen months after his decea&s;e.</P>
<P>This vi&s;ion la&s;ted till my u&s;ual hour of waking, which I did with &s;ome &s;urprize, to find my&s;elf alone, after hav|ing been engaged almo&s;t a whole night in &s;o prodigious a multitude. I could not but reflect with wonder, at the partiality and extravagance of my vi&s;ion; which accord|ing to my thoughts, has not done ju&s;tice to the &s;ex. If virtue in men is more venerable, it is in women more lovely; which Milton has very finely expre&s;&s;ed in his Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, where Adam, &s;peaking of Eve, after hav|ing a&s;&s;erted his own pre-eminence, as being fir&s;t in crea|tion and internal faculties, breaks out into the following rapture:<Q><L>&mdash;Yet when I approach</L>

<P>THERE is nothing gives a man greater &s;atisfaction, than the &s;en&s;e of having di&s;patched a great deal of bu|&s;ine&s;s, e&s;pecially when it turns to the public emolument. I have much plea&s;ure of this kind upon my &s;pirits at pre|&s;ent, occa&s;ioned by the fatigue of affairs which I went through la&s;t Saturday. It is &s;ome time &s;ince I &s;et apart that day for examining the preten&s;ions of &s;everal who had applied to me, for canes, per&s;pective-gla&s;&s;es, &s;nuff|boxes, orange-flower-waters, and the like ornaments of life. In order to adju&s;t this matter, I had before directed Charles Lillie of Beau&s;ord-buildings to prepare a great bundle of blank licences in the following words:
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>You are hereby required to permit the bearer of this cane to pa&s;s and repa&s;s through the &s;treets and &s;uburbs of London, or any place within ten miles of it, without left or mole&s;ta|tion; provided that he does not walk with it under his arm, brandi&s;h it in the air, or hang it on a button: in which ca&s;e it &s;hall be forfeited; and I hereby declare it forfeited to any one who &s;hall think it &s;afe to take it from him.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taffe.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The &s;ame form, differing only in the provi&s;os, will &s;erve for a per&s;pective, &s;nuff-box, or perfumed handker|chief. I had placed my&s;elf in my elbow-chair at the up|per end of my great parlour, having ordered Charles Lil|lie to take his place upon a joint-&s;tool with a writing-de&s;k before him. John Morphew al&s;o took his &s;tation at the door; I having, for his good and faithful &s;ervices, ap|pointed him my chamber-keeper upon court-days. He let me know that there were a great number attending with|out.
<PB N="50" REF="53">
Upon which, I ordered him to give notice, that I did not intend to &s;it upon &s;nuff-boxes that day; but that tho&s;e who appeared for canes might enter. The fir&s;t pre&s;ented me with the following petition, which I or|dered Mr. Lillie to read.
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>To I&s;aac Bicker&s;taffe, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Cen&s;or of Great-Britain. The humble petition of Simon Trippit,</HEAD>
<P>Sheweth,</P>
<P>That your petitioner having been bred up to a cane from his youth, it is now become as nece&s;&s;ary to him as any other of his limbs.</P>
<P>That a great part of his behaviour depending upon it, he &s;hould be reduced to the utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ities if he &s;hould lo&s;e the u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>That the knocking of it upon his &s;hoe, leaning one leg up|on it, or whi&s;tling with it on his mouth, are &s;uch great re|liefs to him in conver&s;ation, that he does not know how to be good company without it.</P>
<P>That he is at pre&s;ent engaged in an amour, and mu&s;t de|&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s, if it be taken from him.</P>
<P>Your petitioner therefore hopes, that, the premi&s;&s;es ten|derly con&s;idered, your wor&s;hip will not deprive him of &s;o u&s;eful and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a &s;upport.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>And your petitioner &s;hall ever, <HI>etc.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Upon the hearing of his ca&s;e, I was touched with &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion, and the more &s;o, when upon ob&s;erving him nearer I found he was a Prig. I bid him produce his cane in court, which he had left at the door. He did &s;o, and I finding it to be very curiou&s;ly clouded, with a tran&s;|parent amber head, and a blue ribbon to hang upon his wri&s;t, I immediately ordered my clerk Lillie to lay it up, and deliver out to him a plain joint headed with walnut; and then, in order to wean him from it by degrees, per|mitted him to wear it three days in the week, and to
<PB N="51" REF="54">
abate proportionably till he found him&s;elf able to go a|lone.</P>
<P>The &s;econd who appeared, came limping into the court: and &s;etting forth in his petition many pretences for the u&s;e of a cane, I cau&s;ed them to be examined one by one; but finding him in different &s;tories, and confronting him with &s;everal witne&s;&s;es who had &s;een him walk upright, I ordered Mr. Lillie to take in his cane, and rejected his petition as frivolous.</P>
<P>A third made his entery with great difficulty, leaning upon a &s;light &s;tick, and in danger of falling every &s;tep he took. I &s;aw the weakne&s;s of his hams; and hearing that he had married a young wife about a fortnight before, I bid him leave his cane, and gave him a new pair of crutches, with which he went off in great vigour and alacrity. This gentleman was &s;ucceeded by another, who &s;eemed very much plea&s;ed while his petition was reading, in which he had repre&s;ented, that he was ex|tremely afflicted with the gout, and &s;et his foot upon the ground with the caution and dignity which accompany that di&s;temper. I &s;u&s;pected him for an impo&s;tor, and hav|ing ordered him to be &s;earched, I committed him into the hands of Dr. Thomas Smith in King-Street, my own corn-cutter, who attended in an outward room; and wrought &s;o &s;peedy a cure upon him, that I thought fit to &s;end him al&s;o away without his cane.</P>
<P>While I was thus di&s;pen&s;ing ju&s;tice, I heard a noi&s;e in my outward room; and enquiring what was the occa&s;i|on of it, my door-keeper told me, that they had taken up one in the very fact as he was pa&s;&s;ing by my door. They immediately brought in a lively fre&s;h-coloured young man, who made great re&s;i&s;tance with hand and foot, but did not offer to make u&s;e of his cane, which hung on his fifth button. Upon examination, I found him to be an Oxford &s;cholar, who was ju&s;t entered at the Temple. He at fir&s;t di&s;puted the juri&s;diction of the court; but being driven out of his little law and logic, he told me very pertly, that he looked upon &s;uch a perpendicular
<PB N="52" REF="55">
creature as a man to make a very imperfect figure with|out a cane in his hand. It is well known, &s;ays he, we ought, according to the natural &s;ituation of our bodies, to walk upon our hands and feet; and that the wi&s;dom of the ancients had de&s;cribed man to be an animal of four legs in the morning, two at noon, and three at night; by which they intimated, that a cane might very pro|perly become part of us in &s;ome period of life. Upon which I a&s;ked him, whether he wore it at his brea&s;t to have it in readine&s;s when that period &s;hould arrive? My young lawyer immediately told me, he had a pro|perty in it, and a right to hang it where he plea&s;ed, and to make u&s;e of it as he thought fit, provided that he did not break the peace with it: and further &s;aid, that he never took it off his button unle&s;s it were to lift it up at a coachman, hold it over the head of a drawer, point out the circum&s;tances of a &s;tory, or for other &s;ervices of the like nature, that are all within the laws of the land. I did not care for di&s;couraging a young man, who, I &s;aw, would come to good; and becau&s;e his heart was &s;et upon his new purcha&s;e, I only ordered him to wear it about his neck, in&s;tead of hanging it upon his button, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal appeared in court, who&s;e preten&s;i|ons I found to be very good, and therefore gave many their licences upon paying their fees; as many others had their licences renewed, who required more time for recovery of their lamene&s;s than I had before allowed them.</P>
<P>Having di&s;patched this &s;et of my petitioners, there came in a well dre&s;&s;ed man, with a gla&s;s-tube in one hand and his petition in the other. Upon his entering the room, he threw back the right &s;ide of his wig, put for|ward his right leg, and advancing the gla&s;s to his right eye, aimed it directly at me. In the mean while, to make my ob&s;ervations al&s;o, I put on my &s;pectacles; in which po&s;ture we &s;urveyed each other for &s;ome time. Upon the removal of our gla&s;&s;es, I de&s;ired him to read his petition, which he did very promptly and ea&s;ily; though at the
<PB N="53" REF="56">
&s;ame time it &s;et forth, that he could &s;ee nothing di&s;tinctly, and was within very few degrees of being utterly blind; concluding with a prayer, that he might be permitted to &s;trengthen and extend his &s;ight by a gla&s;s. In an&s;wer to this, I told him, he might &s;ometimes extend it to his own de&s;truction. As you are now, &s;aid I, you are out of the reach of beauty; the &s;nafts of the fine&s;t eyes lo&s;e their force before they can come at you; you cannot di&s;tin|gui&s;h a toa&s;t from an orange-wench: you can &s;ee a whole circle of beauty without any interruption from an imper|tinent face to di&s;compo&s;e you. In &s;hort, what are &s;nares for others&mdash;My petitioner would hear no more, but told me very &s;eriou&s;ly, Mr. Bicker&s;taffe, you quite mi&s;take your man; it is the joy, the plea&s;ure, the employment of my life, to frequent public a&s;&s;emblies, and gaze upon the fair. In a word, I found his u&s;e of a gla&s;s was occa&s;i|oned by no other infirmity but his vanity, and was not &s;o much de&s;igned to make him &s;ee, as to make him be &s;een and di&s;tingui&s;hed by others. I therefore refu&s;ed him a li|cence for a per&s;pective, but allowed him a pair of &s;pecta|cles, with full permi&s;&s;ion to u&s;e them in any public a&s;&s;em|bly as he &s;hould think fit. He was followed by &s;o very few of this order of men, that I have rea&s;on to hope this &s;ort of cheats are almo&s;t at an end.</P>
<P>The orange-flower-men appeared next with petitions, per&s;umed &s;o &s;trongly with mu&s;k, that I was almo&s;t over|come with the &s;cent; and for my own &s;ake was obliged forthwith to licen&s;e their handkerchiefs, e&s;pecially when I found they had &s;weetened them at Charles Lillie's, and that &s;ome of their per&s;ons would not be altogether inof|fen&s;ive without them. John Morphew, whom I have made general of my dead men, acquainted me, that the peti|tioners were all of that order, and could produce certifi|cates to prove it if I required it. I was &s;o well plea&s;ed with this way of their embalming them&s;elves, that I com|manded the above&s;aid Morphew to give it in orders to his whole army, that every one who did not &s;urrender him&s;elf up to be di&s;po&s;ed of by the upholders, &s;hould u&s;e the &s;ame
<PB N="54" REF="57">
method to keep him&s;elf &s;weet during his pre&s;ent &s;tate of putrefaction.</P>
<P>I fini&s;hed my &s;e&s;&s;ion with great content of mind, re|flecting upon the good I had done; for however &s;light|ly men may regard the&s;e particularities and little follies in dre&s;s and behaviour, they lead to greater evils. The bearing to be laughed at for &s;uch &s;ingularities, teaches us in&s;en&s;ibly an impertinent fortitude, and enables us to bear public cen&s;ure for things which more &s;ub&s;tantially de&s;erve it. By this means they open a gate to folly, and oftentimes render a man &s;o ridiculous, as di&s;credit his virtues and capacities, and unqualify them from doing any good in the world. Be&s;ides, the giving into uncommon habits of this nature, is a want of that humble deference which is due to mankind; and, what is wor&s;t of all, the certain indication of &s;ome &s;ecret flaw in the mind of the per&s;on that commits them. When I was a young man I re|member a gentleman of great integrity and worth was very remarkable for wearing a broad belt, and a hanger in&s;tead of a fa&s;honable &s;word, though in all other points a very well-bred man. I &s;u&s;pected him at fir&s;t &s;ight to have &s;ome|thing wrong in him, but was not able for a long while to di&s;cover any collateral proofs of it. I watched him nar|rowly for &s;ix and thirty years, when at la&s;t, to the &s;ur|prize of every body but my&s;elf, who had long expected to &s;ee the folly break out, he married his own cook|maid.</P>

<P>IT is not to be imagined, how great an effect well-di&s;|po&s;ed lights, with proper forms and orders in a&s;&s;em|blies, have upon &s;ome tempers. I am &s;ure I feel it in &s;o extraordinary a manner, that I cannot in a day or two get out of my imagination any very beautiful or di&s;agree|able impre&s;&s;ion which I receive on &s;uch occa&s;ions. For this rea&s;on, I frequently look in at the play-hou&s;e, in or|der to enlarge my thoughts, and warm my mind with &s;ome new ideas, that may be &s;erviceable to me in my lu|cubrations.</P>
<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition I entered the theatre the other day, and placed my&s;elf in a corner of it, very convenient for &s;eeing, without being my&s;elf ob&s;erved. I found the au|dience hu&s;hed in a very deep attention, and did not que|&s;tion but &s;ome noble tragedy was ju&s;t then in its cri|&s;is, or that an incident was to be unravelled which would determine the fate of an hero. While I was in this &s;u|&s;pence, expecting every moment to &s;ee my friend Mr. Betterton appear in all the maje&s;ty of di&s;tre&s;s, to my un|&s;peakable amazement, there came up a mon&s;ter with a face between his feet; and as I was looking on, he rai&s;ed him&s;elf on one leg in &s;uch a perpendicular po&s;ture, that the other grew in a direct line above his head. It after|wards twi&s;ted it&s;elf into the motions and wreathings of &s;everal different animals, and after great variety of &s;hapes and transformations, went off the &s;tage in the figure of an human creature. The admiration, the applau&s;e, the &s;atis|faction of the audience, during this &s;trange entertainment, is not to be expre&s;&s;ed. I was very much out of counte|nance for my dear country-men, and looked about with &s;ome apprehen&s;ion for fear any foreigner &s;hould be pre|&s;ent.
<PB N="56" REF="59">
Is it po&s;&s;ible, thought I, that human nature can re|joice in its di&s;grace, and take plea&s;ure in &s;eeing its own figure turned to ridicule, and di&s;torted into forms that rai&s;e horror and aver&s;ion? There is &s;omething di&s;in|genuous and immoral in the being able to bear &s;uch a &s;ight. Men of elegant and noble minds are &s;hocked at &s;eeing the characters of per&s;ons who de&s;erve e&s;teem for virtue, knowlege, or &s;ervices to their country, placed in wrong lights, and by mi&s;repre&s;entation made the &s;ub|ject of buffoonry. Such a nice abhorrence is not indeed to be found among the vulgar; but methinks it is wonderful, that the&s;e who have nothing but the outward figure to di&s;tingui&s;h them as men, &s;hould delight in &s;eeing it abu&s;|ed, vilified, and di&s;graced.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, there is nothing that more plea&s;es me, in all that I read in books, or &s;ee among mankind, than &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as repre&s;ent human nature in its proper dignity. As man is a creature made up of different ex|tremes, he has &s;omething in him very great and very mean: a &s;kilful arti&s;t may draw an excellent picture of him in either view. The fine&s;t authors of antiquity have taken him on the more advantagious &s;ide. They culti|vate the natural grandeur of the &s;oul, rai&s;e in her a ge|nerous ambition, feed her with hopes of immortality and perfection, and do all they can to widen the partition be|tween the virtuous and the vicious, by making the diffe|rence betwixt them as great as between gods and brutes. In &s;hort, it is impo&s;&s;ible to read a page in Plato, Tully, and a thou&s;and other ancient morali&s;ts, without being a great|er and a better man for it. On the contrary, I could never read any of our modi&s;h French authors, or tho&s;e of our own country, who are the imitators and admirers of that trifling nation, without being for &s;ome time out of humour with my&s;elf, and at every thing about me. Their bu&s;ine&s;s is, to depreciate human nature, and con|&s;ider it under its wor&s;t appearances. They give mean in|terpretations and ba&s;e motives to the worthie&s;t actions: they re&s;olve virtue and vice into con&s;titution. In &s;hort,
<PB N="57" REF="60">
they endeavour to make no di&s;tinction between man and man, between the &s;pecies of men and that of brutes. As an in&s;tance of this kind of authors among many others, let any one examine the celebrated Rochefoucault, who is the great philo&s;opher for admini&s;tering of con&s;olation to the idle, the envious, and worthle&s;s part of mankind.</P>
<P>I remember a young gentleman of moderate under|&s;tanding, but great vivacity, who by dipping into many au|thors of this nature, had got a little &s;mattering knowlege, ju&s;t enough to make an athei&s;t or a free-thinker, but not a philo&s;opher or a man of &s;en&s;e. With the&s;e accompli&s;h|ments, he went to vi&s;it his father in the country, who was a plain, rough, hone&s;t man, and wi&s;e, though not learned. The &s;on, who took all opportunities to &s;how his learning, began to e&s;tabli&s;h a new religion in the fa|mily, and to enlarge the narrowne&s;s of their country no|tions; in which he &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that he had &s;edu|ced the butler by his table-talk, and &s;taggered his elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter. The old gentleman began to be alarmed at the &s;chi&s;ms that aro&s;e among his children, but did not yet believe his &s;on's doctrine to be &s;o pernicious as it really was, till one day talking of his &s;etting-dog, the &s;on &s;aid he did not que&s;tion but Trey was as immortal as any one of the family: and in the heat of the argument told his father, that for his own part, he expected to die like a dog. Upon which, the old man, &s;tarting up in a very great pa&s;&s;ion, cried out, then, &s;irrah, you &s;hall live like one; and taking his cane in his hand, cudgelled him out of his &s;y|&s;tem. This had &s;o good an effect upon him, that he took up from that day, fell to reading good books, and is now a bencher in the Middle-Temple.</P>
<P>I do not mention this cudgelling part of the &s;tory with a de&s;ign to engage the &s;ecular arm in matters of this nature; but certainly, if it ever exerts it&s;elf in affairs of opinion and &s;peculation, it ought to do it on &s;uch &s;hal|low and de&s;picable pretenders to knowlege, who en|deavour to give man dark and uncomfortable pro&s;pects of his being, and de&s;troy tho&s;e principles which are the
<PB N="58" REF="61">
&s;upport, happine&s;s, and glory, of all public &s;ocieties, as well as private per&s;ons.</P>
<P>I think it is one of Pythagoras's golden &s;ayings, <HI>That a man &s;hould take care above all things to have a due re&s;pect for him&s;elf:</HI> And it is certain, that this licentious &s;ort of authors, who are for depreciating mankind, endeavoured to di&s;appoint and undo what the mo&s;t refined &s;pirits have been labouring to advance &s;ince the beginning of the world. The very de&s;ign of dre&s;s, good-breeding, outward ornaments, and ceremony, were to li&s;t up hu|man nature, and to &s;et it off to an advantage. Archite|cture, painting, and &s;tatuary, were invented with the &s;ame de&s;ign; as indeed every art and &s;cience contributes to the embelli&s;hment of life, and to the wearing off or throw|ing into &s;hades the mean and low parts of our nature. Poetry carries on this great end more than all the re&s;t, as may be &s;een in the following pa&s;&s;age, taken out of Sir Francis Bacon's Advancement of Learning, which gives a truer and better account of this art than all the volumes that were ever written upon it.</P>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Poetry, e&s;pecially heroical, &s;eems to be rai&s;ed alto|gether from a noble foundation, which makes much for the dignity of man's nature. For &s;eeing this &s;en&s;ible world is in dignity inferior to the &s;oul of man, poe&s;y &s;eems to endue human nature with that which hi&s;to|ry denies; and to give &s;atisfaction to the mind, with at lea&s;t the &s;hadow of things where the &s;ub&s;tance can|not be had. For if the matter be throughly con&s;idered, a &s;trong argument may be drawn from poe&s;y, that a more &s;tately greatne&s;s of things, a more perfect order, and a more beautiful variety, delights the &s;oul of man, than any way can be found in nature &s;ince the fall. Where|fore &s;eeing the acts and events, which are the &s;ubjects of true hi&s;tory, are not of that amplitude as to content the mind of man; poe&s;y is ready at hand to feign acts more heroical. Becau&s;e true hi&s;tory reports the &s;ucce&s;|&s;es of bu&s;ine&s;s not proportionable to the merit of virtues and vices, poe&s;y corrects it, and pre&s;ents events and
<PB N="59" REF="62">
fortunes according to de&s;ert, and according to the law of providence: becau&s;e true hi&s;tory, through the frequent &s;atiety and &s;imilitude of things, works a di&s;ta&s;te and mi&s;pri&s;ion in the mind of man, poe&s;y cheareth and refre&s;heth the &s;oul, chanting things rare and various, and full of vici&s;&s;itudes. So as poe&s;y &s;erveth and con|ferreth to delectation, magnanimity, and morality; and therefore it may &s;eem de&s;ervedly to have &s;ome partici|pation of divinene&s;s, becau&s;e it doth rai&s;e the mind, and exalt the &s;pirit with high raptures, by proportion|ing the &s;hews of things to the de&s;ires of the mind; and not &s;ubmitting the mind to things, as rea&s;on and hi|&s;tory do. And by the&s;e allurements and congruities, whereby it cheri&s;heth the &s;oul of man, joined al&s;o with concert of mu&s;ic, whereby it may more &s;weetly in&s;i|nuate it&s;elf, it hath won &s;uch acce&s;s, that it hath been in e&s;timation even in rude times, and barbarous nati|ons, when other learning &s;tood excluded.'</Q>
<P>But there is nothing which favours and falls in with this natural greatne&s;s and dignity of human nature &s;o much as religion, which does not only promi&s;e the en|tire refinement of the mind, but the glorifying of the body, and the immortality of both.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as I had placed my&s;elf in my chair of judi|cature, I ordered my clerk Mr. Lillie to read to the a&s;&s;embly, who were gathered together according to no|tice, a certain declaration, by way of charge, to open the purpo&s;e of my &s;e&s;&s;ion, which tended only to this expla|nation, that as other courts were often called to demand the execution of per&s;ons dead in law, &s;o this was held to give the la&s;t orders relating to tho&s;e who are dead in
<PB N="60" REF="63">
rea&s;on. The &s;ollicitor of the new company of uphold|ers near the Hay-Market appeared in behalf of that u&s;e|ful &s;ociety, and brought in an accu&s;ation of a young wo|man, who her&s;elf &s;tood at the bar before me. Mr. Lillie read her indictment, which was in &s;ub&s;tance, that whereas Mrs. Rebecca Pindu&s;t, of the pari&s;h of St. Martin in the Fields, had by the u&s;e of one in&s;trument called a looking|gla&s;s, and by the further u&s;e of certain attire, made ei|ther of cambric, mu&s;lin, or other linen wares, upon her head, attained to &s;uch an evil art and magical force in the motion of her eyes and turn of her countenance, that &s;he the &s;aid Rebecca had put to death &s;everal young men of the &s;aid pari&s;h; and that the &s;aid young men had ac|knowleged in certain papers, commonly called love-let|ters (which were produced in court, gilded on the edges, and &s;ealed with a particular wax, with certain amorous and enchanting words wrought upon the &s;aid &s;eals) that they died for the &s;aid Rebecca: and whereas the &s;aid Re|becca per&s;i&s;ted in the &s;aid evil practice; this way of life the &s;aid &s;ociety con&s;trued to be, according to former e|dicts, a &s;tate of death, and demanded an order for the in|terment of the &s;aid Rebecca.</P>
<P>I looked upon the maid with great humanity, and de|&s;ired her to make an&s;wer to what was &s;aid again&s;t her. She &s;aid, it was indeed true, that &s;he had practi&s;ed all the arts and means &s;he could to di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf happi|ly in marriage, but thought &s;he did not come under the cen&s;ure expre&s;&s;ed in my writings for the &s;ame; and hum|bly hoped, I would not condemn her for the ignorance of her accu&s;ers, who, according to their own words, had rather repre&s;ented her killing, than dead. She further alleged, that the expre&s;&s;ions mentioned in the papers written to her, were become mere words, and that &s;he had been always ready to marry any of tho&s;e who &s;aid they died for her; but that they made their e&s;cape as &s;oon as they found them&s;elves pitied or believed. She ended her di&s;cour&s;e, by de&s;iring I would for the future &s;ettle the meaning of the words, <HI>I die,</HI> in letters of love.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64">
Mrs. Pindu&s;t behaved her&s;elf with &s;uch an air of in|nocence, that &s;he ea&s;ily gained credit, and was acquitted. Upon which occa&s;ion, I gave it as a &s;tanding rule, that any per&s;ons, who in any letter, billet, or di&s;cour&s;e, &s;hould tell a woman he died for her, &s;hould, if &s;he plea&s;ed, be obliged to live with her, or be immediately interred upon &s;uch their own confe&s;&s;ion, without bail or mainprize.</P>
<P>It happened, that the very next who was brought be|fore me was one of her admirers, who was indicted up|on that very head. A letter, which he acknowleged to be his own hand, was read; in which were the follow|ing words; <HI>Cruel creature, I die for you.</HI> It was ob&s;er|vable that he took &s;nuff all the time his accu&s;ation was reading. I a&s;ked him, how he came to u&s;e the&s;e words, if he were not a dead man? He told me, he was in love with a lady, and did not know any other way of telling her &s;o; and that all his acquaintance took the &s;ame me|thod. Though I was moved with compa&s;&s;ion towards him by rea&s;on of the weakne&s;s of his parts, yet for ex|ample's &s;ake I was forced to an&s;wer, your &s;entence &s;hall be a warning to all the re&s;t of your companions; not to tell lies for want of wit. Upon this he began to beat his &s;nuff-box with a very &s;aucy air; and opening it again, Faith, I&s;aac, &s;aid he, thou art a very unaccountable old fellow&mdash;Prithee, who gave thee power of life and death? What-a-pox ha&s;t thou to do with ladies and lovers? I &s;uppo&s;e thou would&s;t have a man be in company with his mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ay nothing to her. Do&s;t thou call breaking a je&s;t telling a lie? Ha! Is that thy wi&s;dom, old Stiffrump, ha! He was going on with this in&s;ipid common-place mirth, &s;ometimes opening his box, &s;ometimes &s;hutting it, then viewing the picture on the lid, and then the workman&s;hip of the hinge, when, in the mid&s;t of his eloquence, I ordered his box to be taken from him; upon which he was immediately &s;truck &s;peech|le&s;s, and carried off &s;tone-dead.</P>
<P>The next who appeared, was a hale old fellow of &s;ix|ty. He was brought in by his relations, who de&s;ired
<PB N="62" REF="65">
leave to bury him. Upon requiring a di&s;tinct account of the pri&s;oner, a credible witne&s;s depo&s;ed, that he always ro&s;e at ten of the clock, played with his cat till twelve, &s;moaked tobacco till one, was at dinner till two, then took another pipe, played at backgammon till &s;ix, talked of one Madam Frances an old mi&s;tre&s;s of his, till eight, re|peated the &s;ame account at the tavern till ten, then re|turned home, took the other pipe, and then to bed. I a&s;ked him, what he had to &s;ay for him&s;elf? As to what, &s;aid he, they mention concerning Madam Frances &mdash; I did not care for hearing a Canterbury tale, and there|fore thought my&s;elf &s;ea&s;onably interrupted by a young gentleman who appeared in the behalf of the old man, and prayed an arre&s;t of judgment; for that he the &s;aid young man held certain lands by his the &s;aid old man's life. Upon this the &s;ollicitor of the upholders took an occa&s;i|on to demand him al&s;o, and thereupon produced &s;everal evidences that witne&s;&s;ed to his life and conver&s;ation. It appeared, that each of them divided their hours in mat|ters of equal moment and importance to them&s;elves and to the public. They ro&s;e at the &s;ame hour: while the old man was playing with his cat, the young one was looking out of his window; while the old man was &s;moaking his pipe, the young man was rubbing his teeth; while one was at dinner, the other was dre&s;&s;ing; while one was at backgammon, the other was at dinner; while the old fellow was talking of Madam Frances, the young one was either at play, or toa&s;ting women whom he never conver&s;ed with. The only difference was, that the young man had never been good for any thing; the old man, a man of worth before he knew Madam Frances. Upon the whole, I ordered them to be both interred together, with in&s;criptions proper to their characters, &s;ignifying, that the old man died in the year 1689, and was buried in the year 1709. And over the young one it was &s;aid, that he departed this world in the 25th year of his death.</P>
<P>The next cla&s;s of criminals, were authors in pro&s;e and ver&s;e. Tho&s;e of them who had produced any &s;till|born
<PB N="63" REF="66">
work were immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to their burial, and were followed by others, who, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome &s;prightly i&s;&s;ue in their life-time, had given proofs of their death, by &s;ome po&s;thumous children, that bore no re&s;em|blance to their elder brethren. As for tho&s;e who were the fathers of a mixed progeny, provided always they could prove the la&s;t to be a live child, they e&s;caped with life, but not without lo&s;s of limbs; for in this ca&s;e I was &s;atis|fied with amputation of the parts which were mortified.</P>
<P>The&s;e were followed by a great croud of &s;uperannua|ted benchers of the inns of court, &s;enior fellows of col|leges, and defunct &s;tate&s;men; all whom I ordered to be decimated indifferently, allowing the re&s;t a reprieve for one year, with a promi&s;e of a free pardon in ca&s;e of re|&s;u&s;citation.</P>
<P>There were &s;till great multitudes to be examined; but finding it very late, I adjourned the court; not without the &s;ecret plea&s;ure that I had done my duty, and furni&s;h|ed out an hand&s;ome execution.</P>
<P>Going out of the court, I received a letter, informing me, that in pur&s;uance of the edict of ju&s;tice in one of my late vi&s;ions, all tho&s;e of the fair &s;ex began to appear preg|nant who had ran any hazard of it; as was manife&s;t by a particular &s;welling in the petticoats of &s;everal ladies in and about this great city. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I do not attribute the ri&s;ing of this part of the dre&s;s to this occa&s;ion, yet mu&s;t own, that I am very much di&s;po&s;ed to be offended with &s;uch a new and unaccountable fa&s;hion. I &s;hall however pronounce nothing upon it, till I have examined all that can be &s;aid for and again&s;t it. And in the mean time think fit to give this notice to the fair ladies who are now making up their winter-&s;uits, that they may ab&s;tain from all dre&s;&s;es of that kind, till they &s;hall find what judgment will be pa&s;&s;ed upon them; for it would very much trouble me, that they &s;hould put them&s;elves to an unnece&s;&s;ary expence; and I could not but think my&s;elf to blame, if I &s;hould hereafter forbid them the wearing of &s;uch garments, when they have laid out money up|on
<PB N="64" REF="67">
on them, without having given them any previous ad|monitions.</P>

<P>THE watchman, who does me particular honours, as being the chief man in the lane, gave &s;o very great a thump at my door la&s;t night, that I awakened at the knock, and heard my&s;elf complimented with the u&s;u|al &s;alutation of, <HI>Good morrow, Mr. Bicker&s;taffe, good mor|row, my ma&s;ters all.</HI> The &s;ilence and darkne&s;s of the night di&s;po&s;ed me to be more than ordinarily &s;erious; and as my attention was not drawn out among exterior objects, by the avocations of &s;en&s;e, my thoughts naturally fell upon my&s;elf. I was con&s;idering, amid&s;t the &s;tilne&s;s of the night, what was the proper employment of a think|ing being? What were the perfections it &s;hould propo&s;e to it&s;elf? And, what the end it &s;hould aim at? My mind is of &s;uch a particular ca&s;t, that the falling of a &s;hower of rain, or the whi&s;tling of wind, at &s;uch a time, is apt to fill my thoughts with &s;omething awful and &s;olemn. I was in this di&s;po&s;ition, when our bellman began his midnight homily (which he has been repeating to us eve|ry winter night for the&s;e twenty years) with the u&s;ual exordium. <Q><L>Oh! mortal man, thou that art born in &s;in!</L></Q>
Sentiments of this nature, which are in them&s;elves ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, however deba&s;ed by the circum&s;tances that accompany them, do not fail to produce their natu|ral effect in a mind that is not perverted and depraved by wrong notions of gallantry, politene&s;s, and ridicule.
<PB N="65" REF="68">
The temper which I now found my&s;elf in, as well as the time of the year, put me in mind of tho&s;e lines in Shake|&s;pear, wherein, according to his agreeable wildne&s;s of imagination, he has wrought a country tradition into a beautiful piece of poetry. In the tragedy of Hamlet, where the gho&s;t vani&s;hes upon the cock's crowing, he takes occa&s;ion to mention its crowing all hours of the night about Chri&s;tmas time, and to in&s;inuate a kind of religious veneration for that &s;ea&s;on.<Q><L>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</L>
<L>Some &s;ay, that ever 'gain&s;t that &s;ea&s;on comes</L>
<L>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,</L>
<L>The bird of dawning &s;ingeth all night long;</L>
<L>And then, &s;ay they, no &s;pirit dares walk abroad:</L>
<L>The nights are whol&s;ome, then no planets &s;trike,</L>
<L>No fairy takes, no witch has power to charm:</L>
<L>So hallowed, and &s;o gracious is the time.</L></Q></P>
<P>This admirable author, as well as the be&s;t and great|e&s;t men of all ages, and of all nations, &s;eems to have had his mind throughly &s;ea&s;oned with religion, as is evident by many pa&s;&s;ages in his plays, that would not be &s;uffe|red by a modern audience; and are therefore certain in|&s;tances, that the age he lived in had a much greater &s;en&s;e of virtue than the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It is indeed a melancholy reflection to con&s;ider, that the Briti&s;h nation, which is now at a greater height of glory for its councils and conque&s;ts than it ever was be|fore, &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf by a certain loo&s;ene&s;s of prin|ciples, and a falling off from tho&s;e &s;chemes of thinking, which conduce to the happine&s;s and perfection of human nature. This evil comes upon us from the works of a few &s;olemn blockheads, that meet together with the zeal and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of apo&s;tles, to extirpate common &s;en&s;e, and propagate infidelity. The&s;e are the wretches, who, without any &s;how of wit, learning, or rea&s;on, publi&s;h their crude conceptions with the ambition of appearing more wi&s;e than the re&s;t of mankind, upon no other pre|tence,
<PB N="66" REF="69">
than that of di&s;&s;enting from them. One gets by heart a catalogue of title pages and editions; and imme|diately to become con&s;picuous, declares that he is an un|believer. Another knows how to write a receipt, or cut up a dog, and forthwith argues again&s;t the immortality of the &s;oul. I have known many a little wit, in the o|&s;tentation of his parts, rally the truth of the &s;cripture, who was not able to read a chapter in it. The&s;e poor wretches talk bla&s;phemy for want of di&s;cour&s;e, and are rather the objects of &s;corn or pity, than of our indigna|tion; but the grave di&s;putant, that reads, and writes, and &s;pends all his time in convincing him&s;elf and the world that he is no better than a brute, ought to be whipped out of a government, as a blot to a civil &s;ociety, and a defamer of mankind. I love to con&s;ider an infidel, whether di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of dei&s;t, athei&s;t, or free-thinker, in three different lights, in his &s;olitudes, his afflictions, and his la&s;t moments.</P>
<P>A wi&s;e man, that lives up to the principles of rea&s;on and virtue, if one con&s;iders him in his &s;olitude, as taking in the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, ob&s;erving the mutual de|pendence and harmony, by which the whole frame of it hangs together, beating down his pa&s;&s;ions, or &s;welling his thoughts with magnificent ideas of providence, makes a nobler figure in the eye of an intelligent being, than the greate&s;t conqueror amid&s;t the pomps and &s;olemnities of a triumph. On the contrary, there is not a more ridi|culous animal than an athei&s;t in his retirement. His mind is incapable of rapture or elevation: he can only con&s;ider him&s;elf as an in&s;ignificant figure in a land&s;kip, and wandering up and down in a field or meadow, un|der the &s;ame terms as the meane&s;t animals about him, and as &s;ubject to as total a mortality as they, with this aggra|vation, that he is the only one among&s;t them who lies under the apprehen&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>In di&s;tre&s;&s;es, he mu&s;t be of all creatures the mo&s;t help|le&s;s and forlorn; he feels the whole pre&s;&s;ure of a pre&s;ent calamity, without being relieved by the memory of any
<PB N="67" REF="70">
thing that is pa&s;&s;ed, or the pro&s;pect of any thing that is to come. Annihilation is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing that he propo&s;es to him&s;elf, and an halter or a pi&s;tol the only re|fuge he can fly to. But if you would behold one of the&s;e gloomy mi&s;creants in his poore&s;t figure, you mu&s;t con&s;i|der him under the terrors, or at the approach, of death.</P>
<P>About thirty years ago I was a &s;hipboard with one of the&s;e vermin, when there aro&s;e a bri&s;k gale, which could frighten no body but him&s;elf. Upon the rowling of the &s;hip he fell upon his knees, and confe&s;&s;ed to the chaplain, that he had been a vile athei&s;t, and had denied a &s;upreme being ever &s;ince he came to his e&s;tate. The good man was a&s;toni&s;hed, and a report immediately ran through the &s;hip, that there was an athei&s;t upon the up|per-deck. Several of the common &s;eamen, who had never heard the word before, thought it had been &s;ome &s;trange fi&s;h; but they were more &s;urprized when they &s;aw it was a man, and heard out of his own mouth, that he never believed till that day that there was a God. As he lay in the agonies of confe&s;&s;ion, one of the hone&s;t tarrs whi&s;pered to the boat&s;wain, that it would be a good deed to heave him overboard. But we were now within &s;ight of port, when of a &s;udden the wind fell, and the penitent relap&s;ed, begging all of us that were pre&s;ent, as we were gentlemen, not to &s;ay any thing of what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>He had not been a&s;hore above two days, when one of the company began to rally him upon his devotion on &s;hipboard, which the other denied in &s;o high terms, that it produced the lie on both &s;ides, and ended in a duel. The athei&s;t was thru&s;t through the body, and after &s;ome lo&s;s of blood became as good a Chri&s;tian as he was at &s;ea, till he found that his wound was not mortal. He is at pre&s;ent one of the free-thinkers of the age, and now writing a pamphlet again&s;t &s;everal received opinions con|cerning the exi&s;tence of fairies.</P>
<P>As I have taken upon me to cen&s;ure the faults of the age, and country which I live in, I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf inexcu&s;able to have pa&s;&s;ed over this crying one,
<PB N="68" REF="71">
which is the &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e. I &s;hall therefore from time to time give my countrymen particular cautions again&s;t this di&s;temper of the mind, that is almo&s;t become fa&s;hionable, and by that means more likely to &s;pread. I have &s;omewhere either read or heard a very memorable &s;entence, that a man would be a mo&s;t in&s;upportable mon|&s;ter, &s;hould he have the faults that are incident to his years, con&s;titution, profe&s;&s;ion, family, religion, age, and country; and yet every man is in danger of them all. For this rea&s;on, as I am an old man, I take particular care to avoid being covetous, and telling long &s;tories: as I am choleric, I forbear not only &s;wearing, but all interjections of fretting, as pugh! pi&s;h! and the like. As I am a layman, I re&s;olve not to conceive an aver&s;ion for a wi&s;e and good man, becau&s;e his coat is of a different co|lour from mine. As I am de&s;cended of the ancient fa|mily of the Bicker&s;taffes, I never call a man of merit an up&s;tart. As a Prote&s;tant, I do not &s;uffer my zeal &s;o far to tran&s;port me, as to name the pope and the devil to|gether. As I am fallen into this degenerate age, I guard my&s;elf particularly again&s;t the folly I have been now &s;peaking of. And as I am an Engli&s;hman, I am very cau|tious not to hate a &s;tranger, or de&s;pi&s;e a poor Palatine.</P>

<P>I WAS walking about my chamber this morning in a very gay humour, when I &s;aw a coach &s;top at my door, and a youth about fifteen alighting out of it, who I per|ceived to be the elde&s;t &s;on of my bo&s;om-friend that I gave &s;ome account of in my paper of the 17th of la&s;t
<PB N="69" REF="72">
month. I felt a &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure ri&s;ing in me at the &s;ight of him, my acquaintance having begun with his father when he was ju&s;t &s;uch a &s;tripling, and about that very age. When he came up to me, he took me by the hand, and bur&s;t into tears. I was extremely moved, and imme|diately &s;aid, child, how does your father do? He began to reply, my mother &mdash; but could not go on for weeping. I went down with him into the coach, and gathered out of him, that his mother was then dying, and that while the holy man was doing the la&s;t offices to her, he had taken that time to come and call me to his father, who, he &s;aid, would certainly break his heart if I did not go and comfort him. The child's di&s;cretion in coming to me of his own head, and the tenderne&s;s he &s;howed for his parents, would have quite overpowered me, had I not re&s;olved to fortify my&s;elf for the &s;ea&s;on|able performance of tho&s;e duties which I owed to my friend. As we were going, I could not but reflect upon the character of that excellent woman, and the greatne&s;s of his grief for the lo&s;s of one who has ever been the &s;upport to him under all other afflictions. How, thought I, will he be able to bear the hour of her death, that could not, when I was lately with him, &s;peak of a &s;ick|ne&s;s, which was then pa&s;t, without &s;orrow. We were now got pretty far into We&s;tmin&s;ter, and arrived at my friend's hou&s;e. At the door of it I met Favonius, not without a &s;ecret &s;atisfaction to find he had been there. I had formely conver&s;ed with him at his hou&s;e; and as he a|bounds with that &s;ort of virtue and knowlege which makes religion beautiful, and never leads the conver&s;a|tion into the violence and rage of party-di&s;putes, I li|&s;tened to him with great plea&s;ure. Our di&s;cour&s;e chanced to be upon the &s;ubject of death, which he treated with &s;uch a &s;trength of rea&s;on, and greatne&s;s of &s;oul, that in|&s;tead of being terrible, it appeared to a mind rightly cul|tivated, altogether to be contemned, or rather to be de|&s;ired. As I met him at the door, I &s;aw in his face a cer|tain glowing of grief and humanity, heightened with an
<PB N="70" REF="73">
air of fortitude and re&s;olution, which, as I afterwards found, had &s;uch an irre&s;i&s;tible force, as to &s;u&s;pend the pains of the dying, and the lamentation of the neare&s;t friends who attended her. I went up directly to the room where &s;he lay, and was met at the entrance by my friend, who, notwith&s;tanding his thoughts had been compo&s;ed a little before, at the &s;ight of me, turned away his face and wept. The little family of children renewed the ex|pre&s;&s;ions of their &s;orrow according to their &s;everal ages and degrees of under&s;tanding. The elde&s;t daughter was in tears, bu&s;ied in attendance upon her mother; others were kneeling about the bed-&s;ide: and what troubled me mo&s;t was, to &s;ee a little boy, who was too young to know the rea&s;on, weeping only becau&s;e his &s;i&s;ters did. The only one in the room who &s;eemed re&s;igned and comforted was the dying per&s;on. At my approach to the bed-&s;ide, &s;he told me, with a low broken voice, this is kindly done&mdash;Take care of your friend&mdash;Do not go from him. She had before taken leave of her hu&s;band and chil|dren, in a manner proper for &s;o &s;olemn a parting, and with a gracefulne&s;s peculiar to a woman of her character. My heart was torn to pieces to &s;ee the hu&s;band on one &s;ide &s;uppre&s;&s;ing and keeping down the &s;wellings of his grief, for fear of di&s;turbing her in her la&s;t moments; and the wife even at that time concealing the pains &s;he en|dured, for fear of encrea&s;ing his affliction. She kept her eyes upon him for &s;ome moments after &s;he grew &s;peechle&s;s, and &s;oon after clo&s;ed them for ever. In the moment of her departure, my friend, who had thus far commanded him|&s;elf, gave a deep groan, and fell into a &s;woon by her bed-&s;ide. The di&s;traction of the children, who thought they &s;aw both their parents expiring together, and now lying dead before them, would have melted the harde&s;t heart; but they &s;oon perceived their father recover, whom I helped to remove into another room, with a re&s;oluti|on to accompany him till the fir&s;t pangs of his affli|ction were abated. I knew con&s;olation would now be impertinent; and therefore contented my&s;elf to &s;it by
<PB N="71" REF="74">
him, and condole with him in &s;ilence. For I &s;hall here u&s;e the method of an ancient author, who in one of his e|pi&s;tles relating the virtues and death of Macrinus's wife, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;hall &s;u&s;pend my advice to this be&s;t of friends, till he is made capable of receiv|ing it by tho&s;e three great remedies, (<HI>nece&s;&s;itas ip&s;a, dies longa, et &s;atietas doloris</HI>) the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, length of time, and &s;atiety of grief."</Q></P>
<P>In the mean time, I cannot but con&s;ider, with much commi&s;eration, the melancholy &s;tate of one who has had &s;uch a part of him&s;elf torn from him, and which he mi&s;&s;es in every circum&s;tance of life. His condition is like that of one who has lately lo&s;t his right arm, and is every moment offering to help him&s;elf with it. He does not appear to him&s;elf the &s;ame per&s;on in his hou&s;e, at his table, in company, or in retirement; and lo&s;es the reli&s;h of all the plea&s;ures and diver&s;ions that were before en|tertaining to him by her participation of them. The mo&s;t agreeable objects recal the &s;orrow for her with whom he u&s;ed to enjoy them. This additional &s;atisfaction, from the ta&s;te of plea&s;ures in the &s;ociety of one we love, is ad|mirably de&s;cribed by Milton, who repre&s;ents Eve, though in paradi&s;e it&s;elf, no further plea&s;ed with the beautiful ob|jects around her, than as &s;he &s;ees them in company with Adam, in that pa&s;&s;age &s;o inexpre&s;&s;ibly charming.<Q><L>With thee conver&s;ing I forget all time,</L>

<P>THE court being prepared for proceeding on the cau&s;e of the Petticoat, I gave orders to bring in a crimi|nal who was taken up as &s;he went out of the puppet-&s;how about three nights ago, and was now &s;tanding in the &s;treet with a great concour&s;e of people about her. Word was brought me, that &s;he had endeavoured twice or thrice to come in, but could not do it by rea&s;on of her petti|coat, which was too large for the entrance of my hou&s;e, though I had ordered both the folding-doors to be thrown open for its reception. Upon this, I de&s;ired the jury of matrons, who &s;tood at my right hand, to inform them&s;elves of her condition, and know whether there were any private rea&s;ons why &s;he might not make her appearance &s;eparate from her petticoat. This was ma|naged with great di&s;cretion, and had &s;uch an effect, that upon the return of the verdict from the bench of ma|trons, I i&s;&s;ued out an order forthwith, that the criminal &s;hould be &s;tripped of her incumbrances, till &s;he became little enough to enter my hou&s;e. I had before given dire|ctions for an engine of &s;everal legs, that could contract or open it&s;elf like the top of an umbrello, in order to place the petticoat upon it, by which means I might take a lei&s;urely &s;urvey of it, as it &s;hould appear in its proper dimen&s;ions. This was all done accordingly; and forth|with, upon the clo&s;ing of the engine, the petticoat was brought into court. I then directed the machine to be &s;et upon the table, and dilated in &s;uch a manner as to &s;how the garment in its utmo&s;t circumference; but my great hall was too narrow for the experiment; for before it was half unfolded, it de&s;cribed &s;o immoderate a circle, that the lower part of it bru&s;hed upon my face as I &s;at in my chair of judicature. I then enquired for the per&s;on
<PB N="74" REF="77">
that belonged to the petticoat; and to my great &s;urprize, was directed to a very beautiful young dam&s;el, with &s;o pretty a face and &s;hape, that I bid her come out of the croud, and &s;eated her upon a little crock at my left hand. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My pretty maid, &s;aid I, do you own your&s;elf to have been the inhabitant of the garment before us?"</Q> The girl I found had good &s;en&s;e, and told me with a &s;mile, that notwith&s;tanding it was her own petticoat, &s;he &s;hould be very glad to &s;ee an example made of it; and that &s;he wore it for no other rea&s;on, but that &s;he had a mind to look as big and burly as other per&s;ons of her quality; that &s;he had kept out of it as long as &s;he could, and till &s;he began to appear little in the eyes of all her acquaintance; that if &s;he laid it a&s;ide, people would think &s;he was not made like other women. I always give great allowances to the fair &s;ex upon account of the fa&s;hion, and therefore was not di&s;plea&s;ed with the defence of the pretty criminal. I then ordered the ve&s;t which &s;tood before us to be drawn up by a pully to the top of my great hall, and af|terwards to be &s;pread open by the engine it was placed upon, in &s;uch a manner, that it formed a very &s;plendid and ample canopy over our heads, and covered the whole court of judicature with a kind of &s;ilken rotunda, in its form not unlike the cupola of St. Paul's. I entered up|on the whole cau&s;e with great &s;atisfaction as I &s;ate under the &s;hadow of it.</P>
<P>The council for the petticoat was now called in, and ordered to produce what they had to &s;ay again&s;t the po|pular cry which was rai&s;ed again&s;t it. They an&s;wered the objections with great &s;trength and &s;olidity of argument, and expatiated in very florid harangues, which they did not fail to &s;et off and furbelow, if I may be allowed the metaphor, with many periodical &s;entences and turns of oratory. The chief arguments for their client were taken, fir&s;t, from the great benefit that might ari&s;e to our woollen manufactury from this invention, which was cal|culated as follows: the common petticoat has not above four yards in the circumference; whereas this over
<PB N="75" REF="78">
our heads had more in the &s;emi-diameter; &s;o that by al|lowing it twenty-four yards in the circumference, the five millions of woollen petticoats, which according to Sir William Petty (&s;uppo&s;ing what ought to be &s;uppo&s;ed in a well-governed &s;tate, that all petticoats are made of that &s;tuff,) would amount to thirty millions of tho&s;e of the ancient mode. A prodigious improvement of the woollen trade! and what could not fail to &s;ink the power of France in a few years.</P>
<P>To introduce the &s;econd argument, they begged leave to read a petition of the rope-makers, wherein it was re|pre&s;ented, that the demand for cords, and the price of them, were much ri&s;en &s;ince this fa&s;hion came up. At this, all the company who were pre&s;ent lifted up their eyes into the vault; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s we did di&s;cover many traces of cordage which were interwoven in the &s;tiffening of the drapery.</P>
<P>A third argument was founded upon a petition of the Greenland trade, which likewi&s;e repre&s;ented the great con&s;umption of the whale-bone which would be occa&s;ioned by the pre&s;ent fa&s;hion, and the benefit which would there|by accrue to that branch of the Briti&s;h trade.</P>
<P>To conclude, they gently touched upon the weight and unweildine&s;s of the garment, which they in&s;inuated might be of great u&s;e to pre&s;erve the honour of families.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments would have wrought very much upon me, (as I then told the company in a long and elaborate di&s;cour&s;e) had I not con&s;idered the great and additional expence which &s;uch fa&s;hions would bring upon fathers and hu&s;bands; and therefore by no means to be thought of till &s;ome years after a peace. I further urged, that it would be a prejudice to the ladies them&s;elves, who could never expect to have any money in the pocket, if they laid out &s;o much on the petticoat. To this I added the great temptation it might give to virgins, of acting in &s;ecurity like married women, and by that means give a check to matrimony, an in&s;titution always encouraged by wi&s;e &s;ocieties.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="79">
At the &s;ame time, in an&s;wer to the &s;everal petitions produced on that &s;ide, I &s;hewed one &s;ub&s;cribed by the wo|men of &s;everal per&s;ons of quality, humbly &s;etting forth, that &s;ince the introduction of this mode, their re&s;pective ladies had (in&s;tead of be&s;towing on them their ca&s;t-gowns) cut them in &s;hreds, and mixed them with the cordage and backram, to complete the &s;tiffening of their under|petticoats. For which, and &s;undry other, rea&s;ons, I pro|nounced the petticoat a forfeiture. But to &s;hew that I did not make that judgment for the &s;ake of filthy lucre, I order|ed it to be &s;olded up, and &s;ent it as a pre&s;ent to a widow|gentlewoman, who has five daughters, de&s;iring &s;he would make each of them a petticoat out of it, and &s;end me back the remainder, which I de&s;ign to cut into &s;tomachers, caps, facings of my wa&s;tcoat-&s;leeves, and other garnitures &s;uitable to my age and quality.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood that, while I di&s;card this mon&s;trous invention, I am an enemy to the proper or|naments of the fair &s;ex. On the contrary, as the hand of nature has poured on them &s;uch a profu&s;ion of charms and graces, and &s;ent them into the world more amiable and fini&s;hed than the re&s;t of her works; &s;o I would have them be&s;tow upon them&s;elves all the additional beauties that art can &s;upply them with, provided it does not in|terfere with, di&s;gui&s;e, or pervert, tho&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider woman as a beautiful romantic animal, that may be adorned with furs and feathers, pearls and diamonds, ores and &s;ilks. The lynx &s;hall ca&s;t its &s;kin at her feet to make her a tippet; the peacock, parrat, and &s;wan, &s;hall pay contributions to her muff; the &s;ea &s;hall be &s;earched for &s;hells, and the rocks for gems; and e|very part of nature furni&s;h out its &s;hare towards the em|belli&s;hment of a creature that is the mo&s;t con&s;ummate work of it. All this I &s;hall indulge them in; but as for the petticoat I have been &s;peaking of, I neither can nor will allow it.</P>

<P>WHEN I look into the frame and con&s;titution of my own mind, there is no part of it which I ob&s;erve with greater &s;atisfaction, than that tenderne&s;s and concern which it bears for the good and happine&s;s of mankind. My own circum&s;tances are indeed &s;o narrow and &s;canty, that I &s;hould ta&s;te but very little plea&s;ure, could I receive it only from tho&s;e enjoyments which are in my own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but by this great tincture of humanity, which I find in all my thoughts and reflections, I am happier than any &s;ingle per&s;on can be, with all the wealth, &s;trength, beauty, and &s;ucce&s;s, that can be conferred upon a mortal, if he only reli&s;hes &s;uch a proportion of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings as is ve&s;ted in him&s;elf, and is his own private property. By this means, every man that does him&s;elf any real &s;ervice, does me a kindne&s;s. I come in for my &s;hare in all the good that happens to a man of merit and virtue, and partake of many gifts of fortune and power that I was never born to. There is nothing in particular in which I &s;o much rejoice, as the deliverance of good and gene|rous &s;pirits out of dangers, difficulties, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es. And becau&s;e the world does not &s;upply in&s;tances of this kind to furni&s;h out &s;ufficient entertainments for &s;uch an humanity and benevolence of temper, I have ever delighted in reading the hi&s;tory of ages pa&s;t, which draws together into a nar|row compa&s;s the great occurrences and events that are but thinly &s;own in tho&s;e tracts of time which ly within our own knowlege and ob&s;ervation. When I &s;ee the life of a great man, who has de&s;erved well of his country, af|ter having &s;truggled through all the oppo&s;itions of pre|judice and envy, breaking out with lu&s;tre, and &s;hining forth in all the &s;plendor of &s;ucce&s;s, I clo&s;e my book, and am an happy man for a whole evening.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="81">
But &s;ince in hi&s;tory, events are of a mixed nature, and often happen alike to the worthle&s;s and the de&s;erving, in&s;omuch that we frequently &s;ee a virtuous man dying in the mid&s;t of di&s;appointments and calamities, and the vicious ending their days in pro&s;perity and peace; I love to amu&s;e my&s;elf with the accounts I meet with in fabulous hi&s;tories and fictions: for in this kind of writings we have always the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing vice puni&s;hed, and virtue rewarded. Indeed, were we able to view a man in the whole circle of his exi&s;tence, we &s;hould have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing it clo&s;e with happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, according to his proper merit: but though our view of him is interrupted by death before the fini&s;hing of his ad|ventures, if I may &s;o &s;peak, we may be &s;ure that the con|clu&s;ion and cata&s;trophe is altogether &s;uitable to his be|haviour. On the contrary, the whole being of a man, con&s;idered as an hero, or a knight-errant, is comprehended within the limits of a poem or romance, and therefore al|ways ends to our &s;atisfaction; &s;o that inventions of this kind are like food and exerci&s;e to a good-natured di&s;po&s;ition, which they plea&s;e and gratify at the &s;ame time that they nouri&s;h and &s;trengthen. The greater the affliction is in which we &s;ee our favourites in the&s;e relations engaged, the greater is the plea&s;ure we take in &s;eeing them relieved.</P>
<P>Among the many feigned hi&s;tories which I have met with in my reading, there is none in which the hero's perplexity is greater, and the winding out of it more dif|ficult, than that in a Freneh author who&s;e name I have forgot. It &s;o happens, that the hero's mi&s;tre&s;s was the &s;i&s;ter of his mo&s;t intimate friend, who for certain rea&s;ons was given out to be dead, while he was preparing to leave his country in que&s;t of adventures. The hero having heard of his friend's death, immediately repaired to his mi&s;tre&s;s, to condole with her, and comfort her. Upon his arrival in her garden, he di&s;covered at a di&s;tance a man cla&s;ped in her arms, and embraced with the mo&s;t endearing tender|ne&s;s. What &s;hould he do? It did not con&s;i&s;t with the ge|tlene&s;s of a knight errant either to kill his mi&s;tre&s;s, or
<PB N="79" REF="82">
the man whom &s;he was plea&s;ed to favour. At the &s;ame time, it would have &s;poiled a romance, &s;hould he have laid vi|olent hands on him&s;elf. In &s;hort, he immediately entered upon his adventures; and after a long &s;eries of exploits, found out by degrees, that the per&s;on he &s;aw in his mi|&s;tre&s;s's arms was her own brother, taking leave of her be|fore he left his country, and the embrace &s;he gave him no|thing el&s;e but the affectionate farewel of a &s;i&s;ter: &s;o that he had at once the two greate&s;t &s;atisfactions that could en|ter into the heart of man, in &s;inding his friend alive, whom he thought dead; and his mi&s;tre&s;s faithful whom he had believed incon&s;tant.</P>
<P>There are indeed &s;ome di&s;a&s;ters &s;o very fatal, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for any accidents to rectify them. Of this kind was that of poor Lucretia; and yet we &s;ee Ovid has found an expedient even in a ca&s;e like hers. He de&s;cribes a beautiful and royal virgin walking on the &s;ea-&s;hore, where &s;he was di&s;covered by Neptune, and violated after a long and un&s;ucce&s;sful importunity. To mitigate her &s;orrow, he offers her whatever &s;he would wi&s;h for. Never certainly was the wit of woman more puzzled in finding out a &s;tratagem to retrieve her honour. Had &s;he de&s;ired to be turned into a &s;tock or &s;tone, a bea&s;t, fi&s;h or fowl, &s;he would have been a lo&s;er by it: or had &s;he de&s;ired to have been made a &s;ea-nymph, or a god|de&s;s, her immortality would have but perpetuated her di&s;|grace. Give me therefore, &s;aid &s;he, &s;uch a &s;hape as may make me incapable of &s;uffering again the like calamity, or of being reproached for what I have already &s;uffered. To be &s;hort, &s;he was turned into a man, and by that only means avoided the danger and imputation &s;he &s;o much dreaded.</P>
<P>I was once my&s;elf in agonies of grief that are unuttera|ble, and in &s;o great a di&s;traction of mind, that I thought my|&s;elf even out of the po&s;&s;ibility of receiving comfort. The occa&s;ion was as follows: when I was a youth in a part of the army which was then quartered at Dover, I fell in love with an agreeable young woman, of a good family in
<PB N="80" REF="83">
tho&s;e parts, and had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing my addre&s;|&s;es kindly received, which occa&s;ioned the perplexity I am going to relate.</P>
<P>We were in a calm evening diverting our&s;elves upon the top of the clift with the pro&s;pect of the &s;ea, and trifling away the time in &s;uch little fondne&s;&s;es, as are mo&s;t ridi|culous to people in bu&s;ine&s;s, and mo&s;t agreeable to tho&s;e in love.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e our innocent endearments, &s;he &s;natched a paper of ver&s;es out of my hand, and ran away with them. I was following her, when on a &s;udden the ground, though at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the verge of the precipice, &s;unk under her, and threw her down from &s;o prodigious an height upon &s;uch a range of rocks, as would have da&s;hed her into ten thou&s;and pieces, had her body been made of adamant.

<P>The impre&s;&s;ions of grief and horror were &s;o lively on this occa&s;ion, that while they la&s;ted, they made me more mi&s;erable than I was at the real death of this beloved per&s;on, (which happened a few months after, at a time when the match between us was concluded) ina&s;much as the imaginary death was untimely, and I my&s;elf in a &s;ort an acce&s;&s;ary; whereas her decea&s;e had at lea&s;t the alle|viations of being natural and inevitable.</P>

<P>I HAVE lately applied my&s;elf with much &s;atisfaction to the curious di&s;coveries that have been made by the help of micro&s;copes, as they are related by authors of our own and other nations. There is a great deal of plea&s;ure in prying into this world of wonders, which nature has laid out of &s;ight, and &s;eems indu&s;trious to conceal from us. Philo&s;ophy had ranged over all the vi&s;ible creation, and began to want objects for her enquiries, when the pre&s;ent age, by the invention of gla&s;&s;es opened a new and inex|hau&s;lible magazine of rarities, more wonderful and amaz|ing than any of tho&s;e which a&s;toni&s;hed our forefathers. I was ye&s;terday amu&s;ing my&s;elf with &s;peculations of this kind, and reflecting upon myriads of animals that &s;wim in tho&s;e little &s;eas of juices that are contained in the &s;eve|ral ve&s;&s;els of an human body. While my mind was thus fil|led with that &s;ecret wonder and delight, I could not but look upon my&s;elf as in an act of devotion, and am very well plea&s;ed with the thought of the great heathen anatomi&s;t,
<PB N="82" REF="85">
who calls his de&s;cription of the parts of an human body, <HI>An hymn to the &s;upreme being.</HI> The reading of the day produced in my imagination an agreeable morning's dream, if I may call it &s;uch; for I am &s;till in doubt, whether it pa&s;&s;ed in my &s;leeping or waking thoughts. However it was, I fancied that my good genius &s;tood at my bed's-head, and entertained me with the following di&s;cour&s;e; for upon my ri&s;ing, it dwelt &s;o &s;trongly upon me, that I writ down the &s;ub&s;tance of it, if not the very words.</P>
<P>If, &s;aid he, you can be &s;o tran&s;ported with tho&s;e pro|ductions of nature which are di&s;covered to you by tho&s;e artificial eyes that are the works of human invention, how great will your &s;urprize be, when you &s;hall have it in your power to model your own eye as your plea&s;e, and adapt it to the bulk of objects, which, with all the&s;e helps are by infinite degrees too minute for your per|ception. We who are unbodied &s;pirits, can &s;harpen our &s;ight to what degree we think fit, and make the lea&s;t work of the creation di&s;tinct, and vi&s;ible. This gives us &s;uch ideas as cannot po&s;&s;ibly enter into your pre&s;ent conceptions. There is not the lea&s;t particle of matter which may not furni&s;h one of us &s;ufficient employment for a whole eternity. We can &s;till divide it, and &s;till open it, and &s;till di&s;cover new wonders of providence, as we look into the different texture of its parts, and meet with beds of vegetables, mineral and metallic mix|tures, and &s;everal kinds of animals that ly hid, and as it were lo&s;t in &s;uch an endle&s;s fund of matter. I find you are &s;urpri&s;ed at this di&s;cour&s;e; but as your rea&s;on tells you there are infinite parts in the &s;malle&s;t portion of mat|ter, it will likewi&s;e convince you, that there is as great a variety of &s;ecrets, and as much room for di&s;coveries, in a particle no bigger than the point of a pin, as in the globe of the whole earth. Your micro&s;copes bring to &s;ight &s;hoals of living creatures in a &s;poonful of vinegar; but we, who can di&s;tingui&s;h them in their different mag|nitudes, &s;ee among them &s;everal huge Leviathans, that ter|rify
<PB N="83" REF="86">
the little fry of animals about them, and take their pa|&s;time as in an ocean, or the great deep. I could not but &s;mile at this part of his relation, and told him I doubt|ed not but he could give me the hi&s;tory of &s;everal invi|&s;ible giants, accompanied with their re&s;pective dwarfs, in ca&s;e that any of the&s;e little beings are of an human &s;hape. You may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, &s;aid he, that we &s;ee in the&s;e little animals different natures, in&s;tincts and modes of life, which corre&s;pond to what you ob&s;erve in creatures of bigger dimen&s;ions. We de&s;cry millions of &s;pecies &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on a green leaf, which your gla&s;&s;es repre&s;ent only in crouds and &s;warms. What appears to your eye but as an hair or down ri&s;ing on the &s;urface of it, we find to be woods and fore&s;ts, inhabited by bea&s;ts of prey, that are as dreadful in tho&s;e their haunts, as lions and tigers in the de&s;arts of Lybia. I was much delighted with his di&s;|cour&s;e, and could not forbear telling him, that I &s;hould be wonderfully plea&s;ed to &s;ee a natural hi&s;tory of Impercepti|bles, containing a true account of &s;uch vegetables and ani|mals as grow and live out of &s;ight. Such di&s;qui&s;itions, an|&s;wered he, are very &s;uitable to rea&s;onable creatures; and you may be &s;ure, there are many curious &s;pirits among&s;t us who employ them&s;elves in &s;uch amu&s;ements. For as our hands, and all our &s;en&s;es, may be formed to what degree of &s;trength and delicacy we plea&s;e in the &s;ame manner as our &s;ight, we can make what experiments we are inclined to, how &s;mall &s;oever the matter be in which we make them. I have been pre&s;ent at the di&s;&s;ection of a mite, and have &s;een the &s;keleton of a flea. I have been &s;hewn a fore&s;t of numberle&s;s trees, which has been picked out of an acorn. Your mi&s;cro&s;cope can &s;hew you in it a complete oak in miniature; and could you &s;uit all your organs as we do, you might pluck an acorn from this lit|tle oak, which contains another tree; and &s;o proceed from tree to tree, as long as you would think fit to con|tinue your di&s;qui&s;itions. It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, added he, to talk of things &s;o remote from common life, and the or|dinary notions which mankind receive from blunt and
<PB N="84" REF="87">
gro&s;s organs of &s;en&s;e, without appearing extravagant and ridiculous. You have often &s;een a dog opened, to ob&s;erve the circulation of the blood, or make any other u&s;eful enquiry; and yet would be tempted to laugh if I &s;hould tell you, that a circle of much greater philo&s;ophers than any of the royal &s;ociety, were pre&s;ent at the cutting up of one of tho&s;e little animals which we find in the blue of a plumb; that it was tied down alive before them; and that they ob&s;erved the palpitations of the heart, the cour&s;e of the blood, the working of the mu&s;cles, and the convul&s;ions in the &s;everal limbs, with great accu|racy and improvement. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;aid I, for my own part, I go along with you in all your di&s;coveries with great plea&s;ure; but it is certain, they are too fine for the gro&s;s of mankind, who are more &s;truck with the de&s;cription of every thing that is great and bulky. Ac|cordingly we find the be&s;t judge of human nature &s;etting forth his wi&s;dom, not in the formation of the&s;e minute animals, though indeed no le&s;s wonderful than the other, but in that of the Leviathan and Behemoth, the Hor&s;e and the Crocodile. Your ob&s;ervation, &s;aid he, is very ju&s;t; and I mu&s;t acknowlege for my own part, that although it is with much delight that I &s;ee the traces of providence in the&s;e in&s;tances, I &s;till take greater plea&s;ure in con&s;i|dering the works of the creation in their immen&s;ity, than in their minutene&s;s. For this rea&s;on, I rejoice when I &s;trengthen my &s;ight &s;o as to make it pierce into the mo&s;t remote &s;paces, and take a view of tho&s;e heavenly bodies which lie out of the reach of human eyes though a&s;&s;i&s;ted by tele&s;copes. What you look upon as one confu&s;ed white in the milky-way, appears to me a long tract of heavens, di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;tars that are ranged in proper figures and con&s;tellations. While you are admiring the &s;ky in a &s;tarry night, I am entertained with a variety of worlds and &s;uns placed one above another, and ri&s;ing up to &s;uch an immen&s;e di&s;tance, that no created eye can &s;ee an end of them.</P>
<P>The latter part of this di&s;cour&s;e &s;lung me into &s;uch an
<PB N="85" REF="88">
a&s;toni&s;hment, that he had been &s;ilent for &s;ome time before I took notice of it; when on a &s;udden I &s;tarted up and drew my curtains, to look if any one was near me, but &s;aw no-body, and cannot tell to this moment, whether it was my good genius or a dream that left me.</P>

<P>INSTEAD of con&s;idering any particular pa&s;&s;ion or cha|racter in any one &s;et of men, my thoughts were la&s;t night employed on the contemplation of human life in general; and truly it appears to me, that the whole &s;pe|cies are hurried on by the &s;ame de&s;ires, and engaged in the &s;ame pur&s;uits, according to the different &s;tages and divi&s;ions of life. Youth is devoted to lu&s;t, middle-age to ambition, old-age to avarice. The&s;e are the three general motives and principles of action both in good and bad men; though it mu&s;t be acknowleged, that they change their names, and refine their natures, according to the temper of the per&s;on whom they direct and ani|mate. For with the good, lu&s;t becomes virtuous love; ambition, true honour; and avarice, the care of po&s;teri|ty. This &s;cheme of thought amu&s;ed me very agreeably till I retired to re&s;t, and afterwards formed it&s;elf into a plea&s;ing and regular vi&s;ion, which I &s;hall de&s;cribe in all its circum&s;tances, as the objects pre&s;ented them&s;elves, whether in a &s;erious or ridiculous manner.</P>
<P>I dreamed that I was in a wood, of &s;o prodigious an ex|tent, and cut into &s;uch a variety of walks and allies, that all mankind were lo&s;t and bewildered in it. After having wan|dered up and down &s;ome time, I came into the centre of it, which opened into a wide plain, filled with multitudes
<PB N="86" REF="89">
of both &s;exes. I here di&s;covered three great roads, very wide and long, that led into three different parts of the fore&s;t. On a &s;udden, the whole multitude broke into three parts, according to their different ages, and marched in their re&s;pective bodies into the three great roads that lay before them. As I had a mind to know how each of the&s;e roads terminated, and whither it would lead tho&s;e who pa&s;&s;ed through them, I joined my&s;elf with the a&s;|&s;embly that were in the flower and vigour of their age, and called them&s;elves <HI>The band of lovers.</HI> I found, to my great &s;urprize, that &s;everal old men be&s;ides my&s;elf had intruded into this agreeable company; as I had before ob&s;erved, there were &s;ome young men who had united them&s;elves to the band of mi&s;ers, and were walking up the path of Avarice; though both made a very ridiculous figure, and were as much laughed at by tho&s;e they joined, as by tho&s;e they for&s;ook. The walk which we marched up, for thick|ne&s;s of &s;hades, embroidery of flowers, and melody of birds, with the di&s;tant purling of &s;treams, and falls of water, was &s;o wonderfully delightful, that it charmed our &s;en&s;es, and intoxicated our minds with plea&s;ure. We had not been long here, before every man &s;ingled out &s;ome woman to whom he offered his addre&s;&s;es, and profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a lover; when on a &s;udden we perceived this delicious walk to grow more narrow as we advanced in it, till it ended in many intricate thickets, mazes and labyrinths, that were &s;o mixed with ro&s;es and brambles, brakes of thorns, and beds of flowers rocky paths, and plea&s;ing grottos, that it was hard to &s;ay, whether it gave greater delight or perplexity to tho&s;e who travelled in it.</P>
<P>It was here that the lovers began to be eager in their pur&s;uits. Some of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who only &s;eemed to retire for the &s;ake of form and decency, led them into plantations that were di&s;po&s;ed into regular walks; where, after they had wheeled about in &s;ome turns and wind|ings, they &s;uffered them&s;elves to be overtaken, and gave their hands to tho&s;e who pur&s;ued them. Others withdrew from their followers into little wilderne&s;&s;es, where there
<PB N="87" REF="90">
were &s;o many paths interwoven with each other in &s;o much confu&s;ion and irregularity, that &s;everal of the lovers quit|ted the pur&s;uits, or broke their hearts in the chace. It was &s;ometimes very odd to &s;ee a man pur&s;uing a fine woman that was following another, who&s;e eye was fixed upon a fourth, that had her own game in view in &s;ome other quarter of the wilderne&s;s. I could not but ob&s;erve two things in this place which I thought very particular, that &s;everal per&s;ons who &s;tood only at the end of the avenues, and ca&s;t a carele&s;s eye upon the nymphs, during their whole flight, often catched them, when tho&s;e who pre&s;&s;ed them the mo&s;t warmly through all their turns and doubles, were wholly un&s;ucce&s;sful: and that &s;ome of my own age, who were at fir&s;t looked upon with aver&s;ion and contempt, by being well acquainted with the wilderne&s;s, and by dodging their women in the particular corners and allies of it, catched them in their arms, and took them from tho&s;e who they really loved and admired. There was a particular grove, which was called <HI>The labyrinth of co|quettes;</HI> where many were enticed to the chace, but few returned with the purcha&s;e. It was plea&s;ant enough to &s;ee a celebrated beauty, by &s;miling upon one, ca&s;ting a glance upon another, beckoning upon a third, and ada|pting her charms and graces to the &s;everal &s;ollies of tho&s;e that admired her, drawing into the labyrinth a whole pack of lovers, that lo&s;t them&s;elves in the maze, and never could find their way out of it. However, it was &s;ome &s;a|tisfaction to me, to &s;ee many of the fair ones, who had thus deluded their followers, and left them among the intricacies of the labyrinth, obliged, when they came out of it, to &s;urrender to the fir&s;t partner that offered him&s;elf. I now had cro&s;&s;ed over all the difficult and perplexed pa&s;&s;ages that &s;eemed to bound our walk, when on the other &s;ide of them I &s;aw the &s;ame great road running on a little way, till it was terminated by two beautiful tem|ples. I &s;tood here for &s;ome time, and &s;aw mo&s;t of the mul|titude, who had been di&s;per&s;ed among&s;t the thickets, com|ing out two by two, and marching up in pairs towards
<PB N="88" REF="91">
the temples that &s;tood before us. The &s;tructure on the right hand was, as I afterwards found, con&s;ecrated to Virtuous Love, and could not be entered but by &s;uch as received a ring, or &s;ome other token, from a per&s;on who was pla|ced as a guard at the gate of it. He wore a garland of ro&s;es and mirtles on his head, and on his &s;houlders a robe like an imperial mantle, white and un&s;potted all over, excepting only, that where it was cla&s;ped at his brea&s;t, there were two golden turtle doves that buttoned it by their bills, which were wrought in rubies. He was cal|led by the name of Hymen, and was &s;eated near the tem|ple, in a delicious bower, made up of &s;everal trees, that were embraced by woodbines, je&s;&s;amines, and amaranths, which were as &s;o many emblems of marriage, and orna|ments to the trunks that &s;upported them. As I was &s;ingle and unaccompanied, I was not permitted to enter the tem|ple, and for that rea&s;on am a &s;tranger to all the my&s;te|ries that were performed in it. I had, however, the curio|&s;ity to ob&s;erve how the &s;everal couples that entered were di&s;po&s;ed of; which was after the following manner. There were two great gates on the back&s;ide of the edifice, at which the whole croud was let out. At one of the&s;e gates were two women, extremely beautiful, though in a different kind, the one having a very careful and compo&s;|ed air, and the other a &s;ort of &s;mile and ineffable &s;weetne&s;s in her countenance. The name of the fir&s;t was Di&s;cretion, and of the other Complacency. All who came out of this gate, and put them&s;elves under the direction of the&s;e two &s;i&s;ters, were immediately conducted by them into gardens, groves, and meadows, which abounded in delights, and were furni&s;hed with every thing that could make them the proper &s;eats of happine&s;s. The &s;econd gate of this temple let out all the couples that were unhappily married, who came out linked together by chains, which each of them &s;trove to break, but could not. Several of the&s;e were &s;uch as had never been acquainted with each other before they met in the great walk, or had been too well acquaint|ed in the thicket. The entrance of this gate was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="89" REF="92">
by three &s;i&s;ters, who joined them&s;elves with the&s;e wretch|es, and occa&s;ioned mo&s;t of their mi&s;eries. The younge&s;t of the &s;i&s;ters was known by the name of Levity, who, with the innocence of a virgin, had the dre&s;s and behavi|our of a harlot. The name of the &s;econd was Contention, who bore on her right arm a muff made of the &s;kin of a porcupine; and on her left carried a little lap-dog, that barked and &s;napped at every one that pa&s;&s;ed by her.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t of the &s;i&s;ters, who &s;eemed to have an haugh|ty and imperious air, was always accompanied with a tawny Cupid, who generally marched before her with a little mace on his &s;houlder, the end of which was fa&s;hi|oned into the horns of a &s;tag. Her garments were yellow, and her complexion pale. Her eyes were piercing, but had odd ca&s;ts in them, and that particular di&s;temper, which makes per&s;ons, who are troubled with it, &s;ee ob|jects double. Upon enquiry, I was informed that her name was Jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed my ob&s;ervations upon this temple, and its votaries, I repaired to that which &s;tood on the left hand, and was called <HI>The temple of lu&s;t.</HI> The front of it was rai&s;ed on Corinthian pillars, with all the mere|tricious ornaments that accompany that order; whereas that of the other was compo&s;ed of the cha&s;te and matron|like Ionic. The &s;ides of it were adorned with &s;everal grote&s;que figures of goats, &s;parrows, heathen gods, &s;atyrs, and mon&s;ters made up of half man and half bea&s;t. The gates were unguarded, and open to all that had a mind to enter. Upon my going in, I found the windows were blinded, and let in only a kind of twilight, that &s;erved to di&s;cover a prodigious number of dark corners and apartments, into which the whole temple was divid|ed. I was here &s;tunned with a mixed noi&s;e of clamour and jollity: on one &s;ide of me, I heard &s;inging and dan|cing; on the other, brawls and cla&s;hing of &s;words. In &s;hort, I was &s;o little plea&s;ed with the place, that I was going out of it; but found I could not return by the gate where I entered, which was barred again&s;t all that were
<PB N="90" REF="93">
come in, with bolts of iron, and locks of adamant. There was no going back from this temple through the paths of plea&s;ure which led to it: all, who pa&s;&s;ed through the cere|monies of the place, went out at an iron wicket, which was kept by a dreadful giant called Remor&s;e, that held a &s;courge of &s;corpions in his hand, and drove them into the only outlet from that temple. This was a pa&s;&s;age &s;o rugged, &s;o uneven, and choaked with &s;o many thorns and briars, that it was a melancholy &s;pectacle to behold the pains and difficulties which both &s;exes &s;uffered who walk|ed through it. The men, though in the prime of their youth, appeared weak and infeebled with old age: the women wrung her hands, and tore their hair; and &s;eve|ral lo&s;t their limbs before they could extricate them|&s;elves out of the perplexities of the path in which they were engaged. The remaining part of this vi&s;ion, and the adventures I met with in the two great roads of Am|bition and Avarice, mu&s;t be the &s;ubject of another paper.</P>

<P>I WAS recollecting the remainder of my vi&s;ion, when my maid came to me, and told me, there was a gen|tlewoman below who &s;eemed to be in great trouble, and pre&s;&s;ed very much to &s;ee me. When it lay in my power to remove the di&s;tre&s;s of an unhappy per&s;on, I thought I &s;hould very ill employ my time in attending matters of &s;peculation, and therefore de&s;ired the lady would walk in. When &s;he entered, I &s;aw her eyes full of tears: how|ever, her grief was not &s;o great as to make her omit rules; for &s;he was very long and exact in her civilities, which gave me time to view and con&s;ider her. Her clothes were very rich, but tarni&s;hed; and her words very fine, but ill applied. The&s;e di&s;tinctions made me without he&s;itation, though I had never &s;een her before, a&s;k her, if her lady had any commands for me? She then began to weep afre&s;h, and with many broken &s;ighs told me, that their family was in very great affliction&mdash;I be|&s;eeched her to compo&s;e her&s;elf, for that I might po&s;&s;ibly be capable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting them&mdash;She then ca&s;t her eye upon my little dog, and was again tran&s;ported with too much pa&s;&s;ion to proceed; but with much ado, &s;he at la&s;t gave me to under&s;tand, that Cupid her lady's lap-dog, was dangerou&s;ly ill, and in &s;o bad a condition, that her lady
<PB N="92" REF="95">
neither &s;aw company, nor went abroad, for which rea|&s;on &s;he did not come her&s;elf to con&s;ult me; that as I had mentioned with great affection my own dog, (here &s;he curt&s;ied, and looking fir&s;t at the cur, and then on me, &s;aid, Indeed I had rea&s;on, for he was very pretty) her lady &s;ent to me rather than to any other doctor, and hoped I would not laugh at her &s;orrow, but &s;end her my advice. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I had &s;ome indignation to find my&s;elf treat|ed like &s;omething below a farrier; yet well knowing, that the be&s;t as well as mo&s;t tender way of dealing with a wo|man, is to fall in with her humours, and by that means to let her &s;ee the ab&s;urdity of them; I proceeded accor|dingly: Pray, madam, &s;aid I, can you give me any metho|dical account of this illne&s;s, and how Cupid was fir&s;t taken? Sir, &s;aid &s;he, we have a little ignorant country|girl, who is kept to tend him: &s;he was recommended to our family by one, that my lady never &s;aw but once, at a vi&s;it; and you know, per&s;ons of quality are always inclined to &s;trangers; for I could have helped her to a cou|&s;in of my own, but&mdash;Good madam, &s;aid I, you neglect the account of the &s;ick body, while you are complaining of this girl. No, no, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, begging your pardon: but it is the general fault of phy&s;icians, they are &s;o in ha&s;te, that they ne|ver hear out the ca&s;e. I &s;ay, this &s;illy girl, after wa&s;hing Cupid, let him &s;tand half an hour in the window without his collar, where he catched cold, and in an hour after began to bark very hoar&s;e. He had however a pretty good night, and we hoped the danger was over; but for the&s;e two nights la&s;t pa&s;t, neither he nor my lady have &s;lept a wink. Has he, &s;aid I, taken any thing? No, &s;aid &s;he, but my lady &s;ays, he &s;hall take any thing that you pre&s;cribe, provided you do not make u&s;e of Je&s;uits powder, or the cold bath. Poor Cupid, continued &s;he, has always been pthi&s;ical, and as he lies under &s;omething like a chin-cough, we are afraid it will end in a con&s;um|ption. I then a&s;ked her, if &s;he had brought any of his wa|ter to &s;how me. Upon this, &s;he &s;tared me in the face, and &s;aid, I am afraid, Mr. Bicker&s;taffe, you are not &s;erious;
<PB N="93" REF="96">
but if you have any receipt that is proper on this occa&s;i|on, pray let us have it; for my mi&s;tre&s;s is not to be com|forted. Upon this, I pau&s;ed a little without returning any an&s;wer; and after &s;ome &s;hort &s;ilence, I proceeded in the following manner: I have con&s;idered the nature of the di&s;temper, and the con&s;titution of the patient, and by the be&s;t ob&s;ervation that I can make on both, I think it is &s;afe&s;t to put him into a cour&s;e of kitchin phy&s;ic. In the mean time, to remove his hoar&s;ne&s;s, it will be the mo&s;t natural way to make Cupid his own druggi&s;t; for which rea&s;on, I &s;hall pre&s;cribe to him, three mornings &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, as much powder as will ly on a groat, of that noble remedy which the apothecaries call Album Graecum. Upon hearing this advice, the young woman &s;miled, as if &s;he knew how ridiculous an errand &s;he had been employ|ed in; and indeed I found by the &s;equel of her di&s;cour&s;e that &s;he was an arch baggage, and of a character that is frequent enough in per&s;ons of her employment, who are &s;o u&s;ed to conform them&s;elves in every thing to the hu|mours and pa&s;&s;ions of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, that they &s;acrifice &s;uperiority of &s;en&s;e to &s;uperiority of condition, and are in&s;en&s;ibly betrayed into the pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices of tho&s;e whom they &s;erve, without giving them&s;elves leave to con&s;ider, that they are extravagant and ridiculous. How|ever I thought it very natural, when her eyes were thus open, to &s;ee her give a new turn to her di&s;cour&s;e, and from &s;ympathizing with her mi&s;tre&s;s in her follies, to fall a railing at her. You cannot imagine, &s;aid &s;he, Mr. Bick|er&s;taffe, what a life &s;he makes us lead for the &s;ake of this ugly cur: if he dies we are the mo&s;t unhappy family in town. She chanced to lo&s;e a parrat la&s;t year, which, to tell you truly, brought me into her &s;ervice; for &s;he turned off her woman upon it, who had lived with her ten years, becau&s;e &s;he neglected to give him water, though every one of the family &s;ays, &s;he was as innocent of the bird's death as the babe that is unborn. Nay, &s;he told me this very morning, that if Cupid &s;hould die, &s;he would &s;end the poor innocent wench I was telling you of, to
<PB N="94" REF="97">
Bridewell, and have the milk-woman tried for her life at the Old-Baily, for putting water into his milk. In &s;hort, &s;he talks like any di&s;tracted creature.</P>
<P>Since it is &s;o, young woman, &s;aid I, I will by no means let you offend her, by &s;taying on this me&s;&s;age longer than is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and &s;o forced her out.</P>
<P>While I am &s;tudying to cure tho&s;e evils and di&s;tre&s;&s;es that are nece&s;&s;ary or natural to human life, I find my ta&s;k growing upon me, &s;ince by the&s;e accidental cares, and acquired calamities, if I may &s;o call them, my patients contract di&s;tempers to which their con&s;titution is of it|&s;elf a &s;tranger. But this is an evil I have for many years remarked in the fair &s;ex; and as they are by nature very much formed for affection and dalliance, I have ob&s;erved, that when by too ob&s;tinate a cruelty, or any other means, they have di&s;appointed them&s;elves of the proper objects of love, as hu&s;bands, or children, &s;uch virgins have exact|ly at &s;uch a year grown fond of lap-dogs, parrats, or o|ther animals. I know at this time a celebrated toa&s;t, whom I allow to be one of the mo&s;t agreeable of her &s;ex, that, in the pre&s;ence of her admirers, will give a torrent of ki&s;&s;es to her cat, any one of which a Chri&s;tian would be glad of. I do not at the &s;ame time deny but there are as great enormities of this kind committed by our &s;ex as theirs. A Roman emperor had &s;o very great an e&s;teem for an hor&s;e of his, that he had thoughts of making him a con&s;ul; and &s;everal moderns of that rank of men, whom we call country &s;quires, will not &s;cruple to ki&s;s their hounds before all the world, and declare in the pre&s;ence of their wives, that they had rather &s;alute a favourite of the pack, than the fine&s;t woman in England. The&s;e voluntary friend&s;hips between animals of different &s;pecies &s;eem to ari&s;e from in&s;tinct; for which rea&s;on, I have always looked upon the mutual good-will between the &s;quire and the hound, to be of the &s;ame nature with that between the lion and the jackall.</P>
<P>The only extravagance of this kind which appears to me excu&s;able, is one that grew out of an exce&s;s of grati|tude,
<PB N="95" REF="98">
which I have &s;omewhere met with in the life of a Turki&s;h emperor. His hor&s;e had brought him &s;afe out of a field of battle, and from the pur&s;uit of a victorious enemy. As a reward for &s;uch his good and faithful &s;er|vice, his ma&s;ter built him a &s;table of marble, &s;hod him with gold, fed him in an ivory manger, and made him a rack of &s;ilver. He annexed to the &s;table &s;everal fields and meadows, lakes, and running &s;treams. At the &s;ame time he provided for him a &s;eraglio of mares, the mo&s;t beautiful that could be found in the whole Ottoman em|pire. To the&s;e were added a &s;uitable train of dome&s;tics, con&s;i&s;ting of grooms, farriers, rubbers, <HI>etc.</HI> accommodat|ed with proper liveries and pen&s;ions. In &s;hort, nothing was omitted that could contribute to the ea&s;e and happi|ne&s;s of his life who had pre&s;erved the emperor's.</P>
<P><HI>By rea&s;on of the extreme cold, and the changeablene&s;s of the weather, I have been prevailed upon to allow the free u&s;e of the fardingal till the 20th of February next en&s;uing.</HI></P>

<P>I FIND it is thought nece&s;&s;ary, that I, who have taken upon me to cen&s;ure the irregularities of the age, &s;hould give an account of my actions when they appear doubtful, or &s;ubject to mi&s;con&s;truction. My appearing at the play on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>N.B.</HI> A per&s;on dre&s;&s;ed for I&s;aac Bicker&s;taffe did ap|pear at the play-hou&s;e on this occa&s;ion.</NOTE> Monday la&s;t, is looked upon as a &s;tep in my conduct, which I ought to explain, that others may not be mi&s;-led by my example. It is true in matter of fact, I was pre&s;ent at the ingenious entertainment of that day, and placed my&s;elf in a box which was prepar|ed for me with great civility and di&s;tinction. It is &s;aid of Virgil, when he entered a Roman theatre, where there
<PB N="96" REF="99">
were many thou&s;ands of &s;pectators pre&s;ent, that the whole a&s;&s;embly ro&s;e up to do him honour; a re&s;pect which was never before paid to any but the emperor. I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, that univer&s;al clap, and other te&s;timonies of applau&s;e, with which I was received at my fir&s;t appearance in the theatre of Great Britain, gave me as &s;en&s;ible delight as the abovementioned reception could give to that im|mortal poet. I &s;hould be ungrateful at the &s;ame time, if I did not take this opportunity of acknowleging the great civilities that were &s;hown me by Mr. Thomas Dog|get, who made his compliments to me between the acts after a mo&s;t ingenuous and di&s;creet manner; and at the &s;ame time communicated to me, that the company of up|holders de&s;ired to receive me at their door at the end of the Hay-market, and to light me home to my lodg|ings. That part of the ceremony I forbad, and took par|ticular care during the whole play to ob&s;erve the con|duct of the drama, and give no offence by my own be|haviour. Here I think it will not be foreign to my cha|racter, to lay down the proper duties of an audience, and what is incumbent upon each individual &s;pectator in pu|blic diver&s;ions of this nature. Every one &s;hould on the&s;e occa&s;ions &s;hew his attention, under&s;tanding, and virtue. I would undertake to find out all the per&s;ons of &s;en&s;e and breeding by the effect of a &s;ingle &s;entence, and to di|&s;tingui&s;h a gentleman as much by his laugh as his bow. When we &s;ee the footman and his lord diverted by the &s;ame je&s;t, it very much turns to the diminution of the one, or the honour of the other. But though a man's quality may appear in his under&s;tanding and ta&s;te, the regard to virtue ought to be the &s;ame in all ranks and conditions of men, however they make a profe&s;&s;ion of it under the name of honour, religion, or morality. When therefore we &s;ee any thing divert an audience, either in tragedy or comedy, that &s;trikes at the duties of civil life, or expo&s;es what the be&s;t men in all ages have looked upon as &s;acred and inviolable, it is the certain &s;ign of a profli|gate race of men, who are fallen from the virtue of their
<PB N="97" REF="100">
forefathers, and will be contemptible in the eyes of their po&s;terity. For this rea&s;on I took great delight in &s;eeing the generous and di&s;intere&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion of the lovers in this comedy (which &s;tood &s;o many trials, and was proved by &s;uch a variety of diverting incidents) received with an univer&s;al approbation. This brings to my mind a pa&s;&s;age in Cicero, which I could never read without being in love with the virtue of a Roman audience. He there de&s;cribes the &s;houts and applau&s;es which the people gave to the per|&s;ons who acted the parts of Pylades and Ore&s;tes, on the noble&s;t occa&s;ion that a poet could invent to &s;hew friend|&s;hip in perfection. One of them had forfeited his life by an action which he had committed; and as they &s;tood in judgment before the tyrant, each of them &s;trove who &s;hould be the criminal, that he might &s;ave the life of his friend. Amid&s;t the vehemence of each a&s;&s;erting him&s;elf to be the offender, the Roman audience gave a thunder of applau&s;e, and by that means, as the author hints, approved in o|thers what they would have done them&s;elves on the like occa&s;ion. Methinks, a people of &s;o much virtue were de|&s;ervedly placed at the head of mankind: but, alas! plea|&s;ures of this nature are not frequently to be met with on the Engli&s;h &s;tage.</P>
<P>The Athenians, at a time when they were the mo&s;t po|lite, as well as the mo&s;t powerful government in the world, made the care of the &s;tage one of the chief parts of the admini&s;tration: and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;pirit of virtue which appeared in that people upon &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions in a &s;cene of a famous tragedy; an ac|count of which we have in one of Seneca's Epi&s;tles. A covetous per&s;on is repre&s;ented &s;peaking the common &s;en|timents of all who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with that vice in the fol|lowing &s;oliloquy, which I have tran&s;lated literally.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>Let me be called a ba&s;e man, &s;o I am called a rich one. If a man is rich, who a&s;ks if he is good? The que&s;tion is, how much we have; not from whence, and by what means we have it. Every one has &s;o much merit as he has wealth. For my own part let me be rich, oh ye gods! or let me die. The</HI>
<PB N="98" REF="101">
<HI>man dies happily, who dies increa&s;ing his trea&s;ure. There is more plea&s;ure in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth, than in that of parents, children, wife, or friends.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The audience were very much provoked by the fir&s;t words of this &s;peech; but when the actor came to the clo&s;e of it, they could bear no longer. In &s;hort, the whole a&s;|&s;embly ro&s;e up at once in the greate&s;t fury, with a de&s;ign to pluck him off the &s;tage, and brand the work it&s;elf with infamy. In the mid&s;t of the tumult, the author came out from behind the &s;cenes, begging the audience to be com|po&s;ed for a little while, and they &s;hould &s;ee the tragical end which this wretch &s;hould come to immediately. The promi&s;e of puni&s;hment appea&s;ed the people, who &s;at with great attention and plea&s;ure to &s;ee an example made of &s;o odious a criminal. It is with &s;hame and concern that I &s;peak it; but I very much que&s;tion, whether it is po&s;&s;ible to make a &s;peech &s;o impious, as to rai&s;e &s;uch a laudable horror and indignation in a modern audience.</P>
<P>It is very natural for an author to make o&s;tentation of his reading, as it is for an old man to tell &s;tories; for which rea&s;on I mu&s;t beg the reader will excu&s;e me, if I for once indulge my&s;elf in both the&s;e inclinations. We &s;ee the attention, judgment, and virtue of a whole audience, in the foregoing in&s;tances. If we would imitate the be|haviour of a &s;ingle &s;pectator, let us reflect upon that of Socrates, in a particular which gives me as great an idea of that extraordinary man, as any circum&s;tance of his life; or, what is more, of his death. This venerable per&s;on often frequented the theatre, which brought a great many thither, out of a de&s;ire to &s;ee him. On which occa&s;ion it is recorded of him, that he &s;ometimes &s;tood to make him|&s;elf the more con&s;picuous, and to &s;atisfy the curio&s;ity of the beholders. He was one day pre&s;ent at the fir&s;t repre&s;en|tation of a tragedy of Euripides, who was his intimate friend, and whom he is &s;aid to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;everal of his plays. In the mid&s;t of the tragedy, which had met with very great &s;ucce&s;s, there chanced to be a line that &s;eemed to encourage vice and immorality.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="102">
This was no &s;ooner &s;poken, but Socrates ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and without any regard to his affection for his friend, or to the &s;ucce&s;s of the play, &s;howed him&s;elf di&s;|plea&s;ed at what was &s;aid, and walked out of the a&s;&s;em|bly. I que&s;tion not but the reader will be curious to know what the line was that gave this divine heathen &s;o much offence. If my memory fails me not, it was in the part of Hippolitus, who when he is pre&s;&s;ed by an oath, which he had taken to keep &s;ilence, returned for an&s;wer, that he had taken the oath with his tongue, but not with his heart. Had a per&s;on of a vicious character made &s;uch a &s;peech, it might have been allowed as a proper repre&s;en|tation of the ba&s;ene&s;s of his thoughts: but &s;uch an ex|pre&s;&s;ion out of the mouth of the virtuous Hippolitus, was giving a &s;anction to fal&s;hood, and e&s;tabli&s;hing perjury by a maxim.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A continuation of the Vi&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>WITH much labour and difficulty I pa&s;&s;ed through the fir&s;t part of my vi&s;ion, and recovered the centre of the wood, from whence I had the pro&s;pect of the three great roads. I here joined my&s;elf to the middle-aged party of mankind, who marched behind the &s;tandard of Ambition. The great road lay in a direct line, and was terminated by the Temple of Virtue. It was planted on each &s;ide with laurels, which were intermixed with mar|ble trophies, carved pillars, and &s;tatues of lawgivers, he|roes, &s;tate&s;men, philo&s;ophers, and poets. The per&s;ons who travelled up this great path, were &s;uch who&s;e thoughts
<PB N="100" REF="103">
were bent upon doing eminent &s;ervices to mankind, or promoting the good of their country. On each &s;ide of this great road were &s;everal paths that were al&s;o laid out in &s;traight lines, and ran parallel with it. The&s;e were mo&s;t of them covered walks, and received into them men of retired virtue, who propo&s;ed to them&s;elves the &s;ame end of their journey, though they cho&s;e to make it in &s;hade and ob&s;curity. The edifices at the extremity of the walk were &s;o contrived, that we could not &s;ee the Temple of Honour, by rea&s;on of the Temple of Virtue which &s;tood before it. At the gates of this temple we were met by the godde&s;s of it, who conducted us into that of Honour, which was joined to the other edifice by a beautiful tri|umphal arch, and had no other entrance into it. When the deity of the inner &s;tructure had received us, &s;he pre|&s;ented us in a body to a figure that was placed over the high altar, and was the emblem of Eternity. She &s;at on a globe in the mid&s;t of a golden zodiac, holding the fi|gure of a &s;un in one hand, and a moon in the other. Her head was veiled, and her feet covered. Our hearts glowed within us as we &s;tood amid&s;t the &s;phere of light which this image ca&s;t on every &s;ide of it.</P>
<P>Having &s;een all that happened to this band of adven|turers, I repaired to another pile of building that &s;tood within view of the Temple of Honour, and was rai&s;ed in imitation of it, upon the very &s;ame model; but at my ap|proach to it, I found, that the &s;tones were laid together without mortar, and that the whole fabric &s;tood upon &s;o weak a foundation, that it &s;hook with every wind that blew. This was called the Temple of Vanity. The godde&s;s of it &s;at in the mid&s;t of a great many tapers, that burn|ed day and night, and made her appear much bet|ter than &s;he would have done in open day-light. Her whole art was to &s;hew her&s;elf more beautiful and ma|je&s;tic than &s;he really was. For which rea&s;on, &s;he had painted her face, and wore a clu&s;ter of fal&s;e jewels upon her brea&s;t: but what I more particularly ob&s;erved, was, the breadth of her petticoat, which was made altogether
<PB N="101" REF="104">
in the fa&s;hion of a modern fardingal. This place was filled with hypocrites, pedants, free-thinkers, and prating poli|ticians; with a rabble of tho&s;e who have only titles to make them great men. Female votaries crouded the temple, choaked up the avenues of it, and were more in number than the &s;and upon the &s;ea &s;hore. I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s in my return towards that part of the wood from whence I fir&s;t &s;et out, to ob&s;erve the walks which led to this temple, for I met in it &s;everal who had begun their journey with the band of virtuous per&s;ons, and travelled &s;ome time in their company: but upon examination I found, that there were &s;everal paths which led out of the great road into the &s;ides of the wood, and ran into &s;o many crooked turns and windings, that tho&s;e who tra|velled through them often turned their backs upon the Temple of Virtue, then cro&s;&s;ed the &s;traight road, and &s;ometimes marched in it for a little &s;pace, till the crooked path, which they were engaged in, again led them into the wood. The &s;everal alleys of the&s;e wanderers had their particular ornaments: one of them I could not but take notice of in the walk of the mi&s;chievous pretenders to politics, which had at every turn the figure of a per&s;on, whom by the in&s;cription I found to be Machiavel, point|ing out the way with an extended finger like a Mercury.</P>
<P>I was now returned in the &s;ame manner as before, with a de&s;ign to ob&s;erve carefully every thing that pa&s;&s;ed in the region of Avarice, and the occurrences in that a&s;&s;em|bly, which was made up of per&s;ons of my own age. This body of travellers had not gone far in the third great road, before it led them in&s;en&s;ibly into a deep valley, in which they journied &s;everal days with great toil and un|ea&s;ine&s;s, and without the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments of food and &s;leep. The only relief they met with, was in a river that ran through the bottom of the valley on a bed of golden &s;and: they often drank of this &s;tream, which had &s;uch a particular quality in it, that though it refre&s;hed them for a time. it rather inflamed than quenched their thir&s;t. On each &s;ide of the river was a range of hills full
<PB N="102" REF="105">
of precious ore; for where the rains had wa&s;hed off the earth, one might &s;ee in &s;everal parts of them veins of gold, and rocks that looked like pure &s;ilver. We were told, that the deity of the place had forbad any of his votaries to dig into the bowels of the&s;e hills, or convert the trea&s;ures they contained to any u&s;e under pain of &s;tarving. At the end of the valley &s;tood the Temple of Avarice, made after the manner of a fortification, and &s;urrounded with a thou&s;and triple-headed dogs, that were placed there to keep off beggars. At our approach they all fell a barking, and would have very much terrified us, had not an old woman who had called her&s;elf by the forged name of Competency offered her&s;elf for our guide. She carried under her garment a golden bough, which &s;he no &s;ooner held up in her hand, but the dogs lay down, and the gates flew open for our reception. We were led through an hundred iron doors, before we entered the temple. At the upper end of it &s;at the god of Avarice, with a long filthy beard, and a meagre &s;tarved counte|nance, enclo&s;ed with heaps of ingots and pyramids of mo|ney, but half naked and &s;hivering with cold. On his right hand was a fiend called Rapine, and on his left a particu|lar favourite to whom he had given the title of Par&s;imo|ny. The fir&s;t was his collector, and the other his ca&s;hier.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal long tables placed on each &s;ide of the temple, with re&s;pective officers attending behind them. Some of the&s;e I enquired into. At the fir&s;t table was kept the office of Corruption. Seeing a &s;olicitor extremely bu&s;y, and whi&s;pering every body that pa&s;&s;ed by, I kept my eye upon him very attentively, and &s;aw him often going up to a per&s;on that had a pen in his hand, with a multiplication table and an almanack before him, which as I afterwards heard, was all the learning he was ma|&s;ter of. The &s;olicitor would often apply him&s;elf to his ear, and at the &s;ame time convey money into his hand, for which the other would give him out a piece of paper or parchment, &s;igned and &s;ealed in form. The name of this dextrous and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;olicitor was Bribery. At the
<PB N="103" REF="106">
next table was the office of Extortion. Behind it &s;at a per&s;on in a bob-wig, counting over a great &s;um of money. He gave out little pur&s;es to &s;everal, who, after a &s;hort tour, brought him in return &s;acks full of the &s;ame kind of coin. I &s;aw at the &s;ame time a per&s;on called Fraud, who &s;at behind a counter with fal&s;e &s;cales, light weights, and &s;canty mea&s;ures; by the &s;kilful application of which in&s;truments, &s;he had got together an immen&s;e heap of wealth. It would be endle&s;s to name the &s;everal offi|cers, or de&s;cribe the votaries that attended in this temple. There were many old men panting and breathle&s;s, repo&s;ing their heads on bags of money; nay many of them actu|ally dying, who&s;e very pangs and convul&s;ions, which ren|dered their pur&s;es u&s;ele&s;s to them, only made them gra&s;p them the fa&s;ter. There were &s;ome tearing with one hand all things, even to the garments and fle&s;h of many mi&s;e|rable per&s;ons who &s;tood before them, and with the other hand throwing away what they had &s;eized, to harlots, flat|terers, and panders, that &s;tood behind them.</P>
<P>On a &s;udden the whole a&s;&s;embly fell a trembling, and upon enquiry, I found, that the great room we were in was haunted with a &s;pectre, that many times a day ap|peared to them, and terrified them to di&s;traction.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of their terror and amazement the appa|rition entered, which I immediately knew to be Poverty. Whether it were by my acquaintance with this phantom, which had rendered the &s;ight of her more familiar to me, or however it was, &s;he did not make &s;o indigent or fright|ful a figure in my eye, as the god of this loth&s;ome temple. The mi&s;erable votaries of this place were, I found, of another mind. Every one fancied him&s;elf threatened by the apparition as &s;he &s;talked about the room, and began to lock their coffers, and tie their bags, with the utmo&s;t fear and trembling.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I look upon the pa&s;&s;ion which I &s;aw in this unhappy people to be of the &s;ame nature with tho&s;e unaccountable antipathies which &s;ome per&s;ons are born with, or rather as a kind of phren&s;y, not unlike
<PB N="104" REF="107">
that which throws a man into terrors and agonies at the &s;ight of &s;o u&s;eful and innocent a thing as water. The whole a&s;&s;embly was &s;urpri&s;ed, when, in&s;tead of paying my devotions to the deity whom they all adored, they &s;aw me addre&s;s my&s;elf to the phantom.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oh Poverty! &s;aid I, my fir&s;t petition to thee is, that thou would&s;t never appear to me hereafter; but if thou wilt not grant me this, that thou would&s;t not bear a form more terrible than that in which thou ap|peare&s;t to me at pre&s;ent. Let not thy threats and me|naces betray me to any thing that is ungrateful or un|ju&s;t. Let me not &s;hut my ears to the cries of the needy. Let me not forget the per&s;on that has de&s;erved well of me. Let me not, for any fear of thee, de&s;ert my friend, my principles, or my honour. If Wealth is to vi&s;it me, and to come with her u&s;ual attendants, Vanity and Avarice, do thou, oh Poverty! ha&s;ten to my re|&s;cue; but bring along with thee the two &s;i&s;ters, in who&s;e company thou art always chearful, Liberty and Innocence."</Q></P>

<P>THERE is in this city a certain fraternity of chymical operators, who work under ground in holes, caverns, and dark retirements, to conceal their my&s;teries from the eyes and ob&s;ervation of mankind. The&s;e &s;ubterraneous philo&s;ophers are daily employed in the tran&s;migration of liquors, and, by the power of magical drugs and incan|tations, rai&s;ing under the &s;treets of London the choice&s;t products of the hills and valleys of France. They can
<PB N="105" REF="108">
&s;queeze Bourdeaux out of a Sloe, and draw Champagne from an Apple. Virgil, in that remarkable prophecy,
<Q><L>Inculti&s;que rubens pendebit &s;entibus uva;</L></Q>
<Q><L>The ripening grape &s;hall hang on every thorn;</L></Q>
&s;eems to have hinted at this art, which can turn a plan|tation of Northern hedges into a vineyard. The&s;e adepts are known among one another by the name of wine|brewers, and I am afraid do great injury, not only to her maje&s;ty's cu&s;toms, but to the bodies of many of her good &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Having received &s;undry complaints again&s;t the&s;e invi|&s;ible workmen, I ordered the proper officer of my court to ferret them out of their re&s;pective caves, and bring them before me, which was ye&s;terday executed accord|ingly.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who appeared again&s;t them was a merchant, who had by him a great magazine of wines that he had laid in before the war: but the&s;e gentlemen, as he &s;aid, had &s;o vitiated the nation's palate, that no man could be|lieve his to be French, becau&s;e it did not ta&s;te like what they &s;old for &s;uch. As a man never pleads better than where his own per&s;onal intere&s;t is concerned, he exhi|bited to the court with great eloquence, that this new corporation of druggi&s;ts had inflamed the bills of mor|tality, and puzzled the college of phy&s;icians with di&s;ea&s;es, for which they neither knew a name nor cure. He ac|cu&s;ed &s;ome of giving all their cu&s;tomers cholics and me|grims; and mentioned one who had boa&s;ted, he had a tun of claret by him, that in a fortnight's time &s;hould give the gout to a dozen of the healthfulle&s;t men in the city, provided that their con&s;titutions were prepared for it by wealth and idlene&s;s. He then enlarged, with a great &s;how of rea&s;on, upon the prejudice which the&s;e mixtures and compo&s;itions had done to the brains of the Engli&s;h nation; as is too vi&s;ible, &s;aid he, from many late pamphlets, &s;peech|es
<PB N="106" REF="109">
and &s;ermons, as well as from the ordinary conver&s;ati|ons of the youth of this age. He then quoted an inge|nious per&s;on who would undertake to know by a man's writings, the wine he mo&s;t delighted in; and on that occa&s;ion named a certain &s;atyri&s;t, whom he had di&s;cover|ed to be the author of a lampoon, by a manife&s;t ta&s;te of the &s;loe, which &s;howed it&s;elf in it by much roughne&s;s, and little &s;pirit.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place, he a&s;cribed to the unnatural tumults and fermentations, which the&s;e mixtures rai&s;e in our blood, the divi&s;ions, heats and animo&s;ities, that reign a|mong us; and in particular, a&s;&s;erted mo&s;t of the modern enthu&s;ia&s;ms and agitations to be nothing el&s;e but the ef|fects of adulterated Port.</P>
<P>The council for the brewers had a face &s;o extremely inflamed and illuminated with carbuncles, that I did not wonder to &s;ee him an advocate for the&s;e &s;ophi&s;tications. His rhetoric was likewi&s;e &s;uch as I &s;hould have expect|ed from the common draught, which I found he often drank to a great exce&s;s. Indeed, I was &s;o &s;urprized at his figure and parts, that I ordered him to give me a ta&s;te of his u&s;ual liquor; which I had no &s;ooner drank, but I found a pimple ri&s;ing in my forehead; and felt &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible decay in my under&s;tanding, that I would not proceed in the trial till the fume of it was entirely di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P>This notable advocate had little to &s;ay in the defence of his clients, but that they were under a nece&s;&s;ity of making claret if they would keep open their doors, it be|ing the nature of mankind to love every thing that is pro|hibited. He further pretended to rea&s;on, that it might be as profitable to the nation to make French wine as French hats; and concluded with the great advantage that this had already brought to part of the kingdom. Upon which he informed the court, that the lands in Hereford&s;hire were rai&s;ed two years purcha&s;e &s;ince the beginning of the war.</P>
<P>When I had &s;ent out my &s;ummons to the&s;e people, I
<PB N="107" REF="110">
gave at the &s;ame time orders to each of them to bring the &s;everal ingredients he made u&s;e of in di&s;tinct phials, which they had done accordingly, and ranged them in|to two rows on each &s;ide of the court. The workmen were drawn up in ranks behind them. The merchant in|formed me, that in one row of phials were the &s;everal colours they dealt in, and in the other the ta&s;tes. He then &s;hewed me on the right hand one who went by the name of Tom. Tintoret, who, as he told me, was the greate&s;t ma&s;ter in his colouring of any vintner in London. To give me a proof of his art, he took a gla&s;s of fair water; and by the infu&s;ion of three drops out of one of his phi|als converted it into a mo&s;t beautiful pale Burgundy. Two more of the &s;ame kind heightened it into a perfect Lan|guedoc: from thence it pa&s;&s;ed into a florid Hermitage: and after having gone through two or three other chang|es, by the addition of a &s;ingle drop, ended in a very deep Pontack. This ingenious virtuo&s;o, &s;eeing me very much &s;urpri&s;ed at his art, told me, that he had not an opportu|nity of &s;hewing it in perfection, having only made u&s;e of water for the ground-work of his colouring: but that if I were to &s;ee an operation upon liquors of &s;tronger bo|dies, the art would appear to much greater advantage. He added, that he doubted not but it would plea&s;e my cu|rio&s;ity to &s;ee the cyder of one apple take only a ver|milion, when another, with a le&s;s quantity of the &s;ame in|fu&s;ion, would ri&s;e into a dark purple, according to the different texture of parts in the liquor. He informed me al&s;o, that he could hit the different &s;hades and degrees of red, as they appear in the pink and the ro&s;e, the clove and the carnation, as he had Rheni&s;h or Mo&s;elle, Perry or White Port, to work in.</P>
<P>I was &s;o &s;atisfied with the ingenuity of this virtuo&s;o, that, after having advi&s;ed him to quit &s;o di&s;hone&s;t a pro|fe&s;&s;ion, I promi&s;ed him, in con&s;ideration of his great ge|nius, to recommend him as a partner to a friend of mine, who has heaped up great riches, and is a &s;carlet|dyer.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="111">
The arti&s;ts on my other hand were ordered in the &s;e|cond place to make &s;ome experiments of their &s;kill be|fore me: upon which the famous Harry Sippet &s;tept out, and asked me, what I would be plea&s;ed to drink? At the &s;ame time he filled out three or four white liquors in a gla&s;s, and told me, that it &s;hould be what I plea&s;ed to call for; adding very learnedly, that the liquor before him was as the naked &s;ub&s;tance or fir&s;t matter of his com|pound, to which he and his friend, who &s;tood over-a|gain&s;t him, could give what accidents or form they plea|&s;ed. Finding him &s;o great a philo&s;opher, I de&s;ired he would convey into it the qualities and e&s;&s;ence of right Bourdeaux. Coming, coming, Sir, &s;aid he, with the air of a drawer; and after having ca&s;t his eye on the &s;everal ta&s;tes and flavours that &s;tood before him, he took up a little cruet that was filled with a kind of inky juice, and pouring &s;ome of it out into the gla&s;s of white-wine, pre&s;ent|ed it to me, and told me, this was the wine over which mo&s;t of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the la&s;t term had been di&s;patch|ed. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I looked upon that &s;ooty drug which he held up in his cruet as the quinte&s;&s;ence of Engli&s;h Bour|deaux, and therefore de&s;ired him to give me a gla&s;s of it by it&s;elf, which he did with great unwillingne&s;s. My cat at that time &s;at by me upon the elbow of my chair; and as I did not care for making the experiment upon my|&s;elf, I reached it to her to &s;ip of it, which had like to have co&s;t her her life; for notwith&s;tanding it flung her at fir&s;t into freaki&s;h tricks, quite contrary to her u&s;ual gravity, in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour &s;he fell into convul&s;ions; and had it not been a creature more tenacious of life than any other, would certainly have died under the o|peration.</P>
<P>I was &s;o incen&s;ed by the tortures of my innocent do|me&s;tic, and the unworthy dealings of the&s;e men, that I told them, if each of them had as many lives as the injured creature before them, they de&s;erved to forfeit them for the pernicious arts which they u&s;ed for their pro|fit. I therefore bid them look upon them&s;elves as no bet|ter
<PB N="109" REF="112">
than a kind of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins and murderers within the law. However, &s;ince they had dealt &s;o clearly with me, and laid before me their whole practice, I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them for that time; with a particular reque&s;t, That they would not poi&s;on any of my friends and acquaintance, and take to &s;ome hone&s;t livelihood without lo&s;s of time.</P>
<P>For my own part, I am re&s;olved hereafter to be very careful in my liquors, and have agreed with a friend of mine in the army, upon their next march, to &s;ecure me two hog&s;heads of the be&s;t &s;tomach-wine in the cellars of Ver&s;ailles, for the good of my lucubrations, and the comfort of my old-age.</P>

<P>SILENCE is &s;ometimes more &s;ignificant and &s;ublime than the mo&s;t noble and mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive eloquence, and is on many occa&s;ions the indication of a great mind. Several authors have treated of &s;ilence as a part of duty and di&s;cretion, but none of them have con&s;idered it in this light. Homer compares the noi&s;e and clamour of the Trojans advancing towards the enemy, to the crackling of cranes when they invade an army of pygmies. On the contrary, he makes his countrymen and favourites, the Greeks, move forward in a regular determined march, and in the depth of &s;ilence. I find in the accounts which are given us of &s;ome of the more Ea&s;tern nations, where the inhabitants are di&s;po&s;ed by their con&s;titutions and cli|mates to higher &s;trains of thought, and more elevated ra|ptures, than what we &s;eel in the Northern regions of the world, that &s;ilence is a religious exerci&s;e among them. For when their public devotions are in the greate&s;t &s;er|vour, and their hearts lifted up as high as words can rai&s;e them, there are certain &s;u&s;pen&s;ions of found and
<PB N="110" REF="113">
motion, for a time, in which the mind is left to it&s;elf, and &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;well with &s;uch &s;ecret conceptions as are too big for utterance. I have my&s;elf been wonderfully delighted with a ma&s;ter-piece of mu&s;ic, when in the very tumult and ferment of their harmony, all the voices and in&s;truments have &s;topped &s;hort on a &s;udden, and after a little pau&s;e recovered them&s;elves again as it were, and renewed the concert in all its parts. Methoughts this &s;hort interval of &s;ilence has had more mu&s;ic in it than any the &s;ame &s;pace of time before or after it. There are two in&s;tances of &s;ilence in the two greate&s;t poets that ever wrote, which have &s;omething in them as &s;ublime as any of the &s;peeches in their whole works. The fir&s;t is that of Ajax, in the eleventh book of the Ody&s;&s;ey. Uly&s;|&s;es, who had been the rival of this great man in his life, as well as the occa&s;ion of his death, upon meeting his &s;hade in the region of departed heroes, makes his &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to him with an humility next to adoration, which the other pa&s;&s;es over with dumb &s;ullen maje&s;ty, and &s;uch a &s;ilence, as, to u&s;e the words of Longinus, had more greatne&s;s in it than any thing he could have &s;poken.</P>
<P>The next in&s;tance I &s;hall mention is in Virgil, where the poet, doubtle&s;s, imitates this &s;ilence of Ajax in that of Dido; though I do not know that any of his commen|tators have taken notice of it. Aeneas finding, among the &s;hades of de&s;pairing lovers, the gho&s;t of her who had late|ly died for him, with the wound &s;till fre&s;h upon her, ad|dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to her with expanded arms, floods of tears, and the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate profe&s;&s;ions of his own in|nocence as to what had happened; all which Dido re|ceives with dignity and di&s;dain of a re&s;enting lover, and an injured queen; and is &s;o far from vouch&s;afing him an an&s;wer, that &s;he does not give him a &s;ingle look. The poet repre&s;ents her as turning away her face from him while he &s;poke to her; and after having kept her eyes for &s;ome time upon the ground, as one that heard and contemned his prote&s;tations, flying from him into the grove of myrtle,
<PB N="111" REF="114">
and into the arms of another, who&s;e fidelity had de&s;erved her love.</P>
<P>I have often thought our writers of tragedy have been very defective in this particular, and that they might have given great beauty to their works, by certain &s;tops and pau&s;es in the repre&s;entation of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions, as it is not in the power of language to expre&s;s. There is &s;omething like this in the la&s;t act of Venice Pre&s;erved, where Pierre is brought to an infamous execution, and begs of his friend, as a reparation for pa&s;t injuries, and the only fa|vour he could do him, to re&s;cue him from the ignominy of the wheel, by &s;tabbing him. As he is going to make this dreadful reque&s;t, he is not able to communicate it, but withdraws his face from his friend's ear, and bur&s;ts into tears. The melancholy &s;ilence that follows hereup|on, and continues till he has recovered him&s;elf enough to reveal his mind to his friend, rai&s;es in the &s;pectators a grief that is inexpre&s;&s;ible, and an idea of &s;uch a complica|ted di&s;tre&s;s in the actor as words cannot utter. It would look as ridiculous to many readers to give rules and di|rections for proper &s;ilences, as for <HI>penning a whi&s;per:</HI> but it is certain, that in the extremity of mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, par|ticularly &s;urprize, admiration, a&s;toni&s;hment, nay, rage it&s;elf, there is nothing more graceful than to &s;ee the play &s;tand for a few moments, and the audience fixed in an a|greeable &s;u&s;pence during the &s;ilence of a &s;kilful actor.</P>
<P>But &s;ilence never &s;hews it&s;elf to &s;o great an advantage, as when it is made the reply to calumny and defamation, provided that we give no ju&s;t occa&s;ion for them. We might produce an example of it in the behaviour of one in whom it appeared in all its maje&s;ty, and one who&s;e &s;ilence, as well as his per&s;on, was altogether divine. When one con&s;iders this &s;ubject only in its &s;ublimity, this great in&s;tance could not but occur to me; and &s;ince I only make u&s;e of it to &s;hew the highe&s;t example of it, I hope I do not offend in it. To forbear replying to an unju&s;t reproach, and overlook it with a generous, or, if po&s;&s;ible, with an entire neglect of it, is one of the mo&s;t
<PB N="112" REF="115">
heroic acts of a great mind. And I mu&s;t confe&s;s, when I reflect upon the behaviour of &s;ome of the greate&s;t men of antiquity, I do not &s;o much admire them that they de&s;erv|ed the prai&s;e of the whole age they lived in, as becau&s;e they contemned the envy and detraction of it.</P>
<P>All that is incumbent on a man of worth, who &s;uffers under &s;o ill a treatment, is to ly by for &s;ome time in &s;ilence and ob&s;curity, till the prejudice of the times be over, and his reputation cleared. I have often read with a great deal of plea&s;ure a legacy of the famous lord Bacon, one of the greate&s;t geniu&s;es that our own or any country has produced; after having bequeathed his &s;oul, body, and e&s;tate, in the u&s;ual form, he adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My name and memory I leave to foreign nations, and to my coun|trymen, after &s;ome time be pa&s;&s;ed over."</Q></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that I recommend this philo&s;ophy to others, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am &s;o poor a pro&s;icient in it my|&s;elf, that if in the cour&s;e of my lucubrations it happens, as it has done more than once, that my paper is duller than in con&s;cience it ought to be, I think the time an age till I have an opportunity of putting out another, and grow|ing famous again for two days.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not clo&s;e my di&s;cour&s;e upon &s;ilence, without informing my reader, that I have by me an elaborate trea|ti&s;e on the Apo&s;iope&s;is called an <HI>Et caetera,</HI> it being a figure much u&s;ed by &s;ome learned authors, and particu|larly by the great Littleton, who, as my lord chief ju&s;tice Coke ob&s;erves, had a mo&s;t admirable talent at an <HI>etc.</HI></P>

<P>AMONG the various &s;ets of corre&s;pondents who apply to me for advice, and &s;end up their ca&s;es from all parts of Great Britain, there are none who are more im|portunate with me, and whom I am more inclined to an&s;wer, than the Complainers. One of them dates his let|ter to me from the banks of a purling &s;tream, where he u&s;ed to rominate in &s;olitude upon the divine Clari&s;&s;a, and where he is now looking about for a convenient leap, which he tells me he is re&s;olved to take, unle&s;s I &s;upport him un|der the lo&s;s of that charming perjured woman. Poor Lavinia pre&s;&s;es as much for con&s;olation on the other &s;ide, and is reduced to &s;uch an extremity of de&s;pair by the in|con&s;tancy of Philander, that &s;he tells me &s;he writes her letter with her pen in one hand, and her garter in the other. A gentleman of an ancient family in Norfolk is almo&s;t out of his wits upon account of a greyhound, that, after having been his in&s;eparable companion for ten years, is at la&s;t run mad. Another, who I believe is &s;e|rious, complains to me, in a very moving manner, of the lo&s;s of a wife: and another, in terms &s;till more mov|ing, of a pur&s;e of money that was taken from him on Bag&s;hot Heath, and which, he tells me, would not have troubled him if he had given it to the poor. In &s;hort, there is &s;carce a calamity in human life that has not produced me a letter.</P>
<P>It is indeed wonderful to con&s;ider, how men are able to rai&s;e affliction to them&s;elves out of every thing. Lands

and hou&s;es, &s;heep and oxen, can convey happine&s;s and mi&s;ery into the hearts of rea&s;onable creatures. Nay, I have known a muff, a &s;carf, or a tippet, become a &s;olid ble&s;&s;ing or misfortune. A lap-dog has broke the hearts of thou&s;ands. Flavia, who had buried five children, and two hu&s;bands, was never able to get over the lo&s;s of her parrat. How often has a divine creature been thrown into a fit by a neglect at a ball or an a&s;&s;embly! Mop&s;a has kept her chamber ever &s;ince the la&s;t ma&s;querade, and is in greater danger of her life upon being left out of it, than Clarinda from the violent cold which &s;he caught at it. Nor are the&s;e dear creatures the only &s;ufferers by &s;uch imaginary calamities: many an author has been de|jected at the cen&s;ure of one whom he ever looked upon as an idiot; and many a hero ca&s;t into a fit of melancho|ly, becau&s;e the rabble have not hooted at him as he pa&s;|&s;ed through the &s;treets. Theron places all his happine&s;s in a running hor&s;e, Suffenus in a gilded chariot, Fulvius in a blue &s;tring, and Florio a tulip-root. It would be endle&s;s to enumerate the many fanta&s;tical afflictions that di&s;turb mankind; but as a mi&s;ery is not to be mea&s;ured from the nature of the evil, but from the temper of the &s;ufferer, I &s;hall pre&s;ent my readers, who are unhappy either in re|ality or imagination, with an allegory, for which I am indebted to the great father and prince of poets.</P>
<P>As I was &s;itting after dinner in my elbow-chair, I took up Homer, and dipped into that famous &s;peech of Achilles to Priam, in which he tells him, that Jupiter has by him two great ve&s;&s;els, the one filled with ble&s;&s;ings, and the o|ther with misfortunes; out of which he mingles a com|po&s;ition for every man that comes into the world. This pa&s;&s;age &s;o exceedingly plea&s;ed me, that as I fell in&s;en|&s;ibly into my afternoon's &s;lumber, it wrought my imag|ination into the following dream.</P>
<P>When Jupiter took into his hands the government of the world, the &s;everal parts of nature, with the pre&s;iding deities, did homage to him. One pre&s;ented him with a mountain of winds, another with a magazine of hail,
<PB N="115" REF="118">
and a third with a pile of thunder-bolts. The &s;tars of|fered up their influences, the ocean gave in his trident, the earth her fruits, and the &s;un his &s;ea&s;ons. Among the &s;everal deities who came to make their court on this oc|ca&s;ion, the De&s;tinies advanced with two great tuns carried before them, one of which they fixed at the right hand of Jupiter as he &s;at upon his throne, and the other on his left. The fir&s;t was filled with all the ble&s;&s;ings, and the other with all the calamities of human life. Jupiter, in the begin|ning of his reign, finding the world much more innocent than it is in this iron age, poured very plentifully out of the tun that &s;tood at his right hand; but as mankind de|generated, and became unworthy of his ble&s;&s;ings, he &s;et abroach the other ve&s;&s;el, that filled the world with pain and poverty, battles and di&s;tempers, jealou&s;y and fal&s;hood, intoxicating plea&s;ures and untimely deaths.</P>
<P>He was at length &s;o very much incen&s;ed at the great depravation of human nature, and the repeated provo|cations which he received from all parts of the earth, that having re&s;olved to de&s;troy the whole &s;pecies, except Deu|calion and Pyrrha, he commanded the De&s;tinies to gather up the ble&s;&s;ings which he had thrown away upon the &s;ons of men, and lay them up till the world &s;hould be inhabit|ed by a more virtuous and de&s;erving race of mortals.</P>
<P>The three &s;i&s;ters immediately repaired to the earth, in &s;earch of the &s;everal ble&s;&s;ings that had been &s;cattered on it; but found the ta&s;k which was enjoined them, to be much more difficult than they had imagined. The fir&s;t places they re&s;orted to, as the mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed in, were cities, palaces, and courts; but in&s;tead of meeting with what they looked for here, they found nothing but envy, repining, unea&s;ine&s;s, and the like bitter ingredients of the left-hand ve&s;&s;el. Whereas, to their great &s;urprize, they di&s;covered content, chearfulne&s;s, health, innocence, and other the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial ble&s;&s;ings of life, in cottages, &s;hades, and &s;olitudes.</P>
<P>There was another circum&s;tance no le&s;s unexpected than the former, and which gave them very great perplexi|ty
<PB N="116" REF="119">
in the di&s;charge of the tru&s;t which Jupiter had commit|ted to them. They ob&s;erved that &s;everal ble&s;&s;ings had de|generated into calamities, and that &s;everal calamities had improved into ble&s;&s;ings, according as they fell into the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of wi&s;e or fooli&s;h men. They often found power with &s;o much in&s;olence and impatience cleaving to it, that it be|came a misfortune to the per&s;on on whom it was confer|red. Youth had often di&s;tempers growing about it, wor&s;e than the infirmities of old-age: wealth was often united to &s;uch a &s;ordid avarice, as made it the mo&s;t uncomfortable and painful kind of poverty. On the contrary, they often found pain made glorious by fortitude, poverty lo&s;t in con|tent, de&s;ormity beautified with virtue. In a word, the ble&s;|&s;ings were often like good fruits planted in a bad &s;oil, that by degrees fall off from their natural reli&s;h, into ta&s;tes al|together in&s;ipid or unwhol&s;ome; and the calamities like har&s;h fruits, cultivated in a good &s;oil, and enriched by proper grafts and inoculations, till they &s;well with ge|nerous and delightful juices.</P>
<P>There was &s;till a third circum&s;tance that occa&s;ioned as great a &s;urprize to the three &s;i&s;ters as either of the fore|going, when they di&s;covered &s;everal ble&s;&s;ings and calami|ties which had never been in either of the tuns that &s;tood by the throne of Jupiter, and were neverthele&s;s as great occa&s;ions of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery as any there. The&s;e were that &s;purious crop of ble&s;&s;ings and calamities which were never &s;own by the hand of the deity, but grow of them&s;elves out of the fancies and di&s;po&s;itions of human creatures. Such are dre&s;s, titles, place, equipage, fal&s;e &s;hame, and groundle&s;s &s;ear, with the like vain imaginati|ons that &s;hoot up in trifling, weak, and irre&s;olute minds.</P>
<P>The De&s;tinies, finding them&s;elves in &s;o great a perplexi|ty, concluded, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to execute the commands that had been given them accord|ing to their fir&s;t intention; for which rea&s;on they agreed to throw all the ble&s;&s;ings and calamities together into one large ve&s;&s;el, and in that manner offer them up at the feet of Jupiter.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="120">
This was performed accordingly, the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter pre|&s;enting her&s;elf before the ve&s;&s;el and introducing it with an apology for what they had done.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>O Jupiter! &s;ays &s;he, we have gathered together all the good and evil, the comforts and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of human life, which we thus pre&s;ent before thee in one promi&s;cuous heap.

<P>READING is to the mind, what exerci&s;e is to the bo|dy: as by the one, health is pre&s;erved, &s;trengthened and invigorated; by the other, virtue, which is the health of the mind, is kept alive, cheri&s;hed and confirmed. But as exerci&s;e becomes tedious and painful when we make u&s;e of it only as the means of health, &s;o reading is apt to grow unea&s;y and burden&s;ome, when we apply our&s;elves to it only for our improvement in virtue. For this rea&s;on, the virtue which we gather from a &s;able, or an allegory, is like the health we get by hunting; as we are engaged in an agreeable pur&s;uit that draws us on with plea&s;ure, and makes us in&s;en&s;ible of the fatigues that accompany it.</P>
<P>After this preface, I &s;hall &s;et down a very beautiful alle|gorical fable of the great poet whom I mentioned in my la&s;t paper, and whom it is very difficult to lay a&s;ide when one is engaged in the reading of him; and this I parti|cularly de&s;ign for the u&s;e of &s;everal of my fair corre&s;pon|dents, who in their letters have complained to me, that they have lo&s;t the affections of their hu&s;bands, and de&s;ire my advice how to recover them.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="121">
Juno, &s;ays Homer, &s;eeing her Jupiter &s;eated on the top of mount Ida, and knowing that he conceived an aver&s;ion to her, began to &s;tudy how &s;he &s;hould regain his affecti|ons, and make her&s;elf amiable to him. With this thought &s;he immediately retired into her chamber, where &s;he bath|ed her&s;elf in ambro&s;ia, which gave her per&s;on all its beau|ty, and diffu&s;ed &s;o divine an odour, as refre&s;hed all na|ture, and &s;weetened both heaven and earth. She let her immortal tre&s;&s;es flow in the mo&s;t graceful manner, and took a particular care to dre&s;s her&s;elf in &s;everal orna|ments, which the poet de&s;cribes at length, and which the godde&s;s cho&s;e out as the mo&s;t proper to &s;et off her per&s;on to the be&s;t advantage. In the next place, &s;he made a vi&s;it to Venus, the deity who pre&s;ides over love, and begged of her, as a particular favour, that &s;he would lend her for a while tho&s;e charms with which &s;he &s;ubdued the hearts both of gods and men. For, &s;ays the godde&s;s, I would make u&s;e of them to reconcile the two deities, who took care of me in my infancy, and who, at pre&s;ent, are at &s;o great a variance, that they are e&s;tranged from each other's bed. Venus was proud of an opportunity of obliging &s;o great a godde&s;s, and therefore made her a pre&s;ent of the Ce&s;tus which &s;he u&s;ed to wear about her own wai&s;t, with advice to hide it in her bo&s;om, till &s;he had accom|pli&s;hed her intention. This Ce&s;tus was a fine party-co|loured girdle, which, as Homer tells us, had all the attra|ctions of the &s;ex wrought into it. The four principal fi|gures in the embroidery were love, de&s;ire, fondne&s;s of &s;peech, and conver&s;ation, filled with that &s;weetne&s;s and complacency which, &s;ays the poet, in&s;en&s;ibly &s;teal away the hearts of the wi&s;e&s;t men.</P>
<P>Juno, after having made the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary preparations, came as by accident into the pre&s;ence of Jupiter, who is &s;aid to have been as much inflamed with her beauty, as when he fir&s;t &s;tole to her embraces without the con&s;ent of their parents. Juno, to cover her real thoughts, told him, as &s;he had told Venus, that &s;he was going to make a vi&s;it to Oceanus and Tethys. He prevailed upon her to &s;tay
<PB N="119" REF="122">
with him, prote&s;ting to her, that &s;he appeared more ami|able in his eye, than ever any mortal, godde&s;s, or even her&s;elf, had appeared to him till that day. The poet then repre&s;ents him in &s;o great an ardour, that (without going up to the hou&s;e which had been built by the hands of Vulcan, according to Juno's direction) he threw a gol|den cloud over their heads as they &s;at upon the top of mount Ida, while the earth beneath them &s;prung up in lo|tus's, &s;affrons, hyacinths, and a bed of the &s;ofte&s;t flow|ers for their repo&s;e.</P>
<P>This clo&s;e tran&s;lation of one of the fine&s;t pa&s;&s;ages in Homer, may &s;ugge&s;t abundance of in&s;truction to a woman who has a mind to pre&s;erve or recal the affection of her hu&s;band. The care of the per&s;on, and the dre&s;s, with the particular blandi&s;hments woven in the Ce&s;tus, are &s;o plainly recommended by this fable, and &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in every female who de&s;ires to plea&s;e, that they need no further explanation. The di&s;cretion likewi&s;e in covering all matrimonial quarrels from the knowlege of others, is taught in the pretended vi&s;it to Tethys, in the &s;peech where Juno addre&s;&s;es her&s;elf to Venus; as the cha&s;te and prudent management of a wife's charms is inti|mated by the &s;ame pretence for her appearing before Ju|piter, and by the concealment of the Ce&s;tus in her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave this tale to the con&s;ideration of &s;uch good hou&s;ewives who are never well dre&s;&s;ed but when they are abroad, and think it nece&s;&s;ary to appear more agreeable to all men living than their hu&s;bands: as al&s;o to tho&s;e prudent ladies, who, to avoid the appearance of being over-fond, entertain their hu&s;bands with indifference, a|ver&s;ion, &s;ullen &s;ilence, or exa&s;perating language.</P>

<P>Upon my coming home la&s;t night, I found a very hand|&s;ome pre&s;ent of wine left for me, as a ta&s;te of 216 <HI>hog|&s;heads which are to be put to &s;ale at</HI> 20 <HI>l. a hog&s;head, at Garraway's coffee hou&s;e in Exchange-alley, on the</HI> 22<HI>d in|&s;tant,</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="123">
<HI>at three in the afternoon, and to be ta&s;ted in major Long's vaults from the</HI> 20<HI>th in&s;tant till the time of &s;ale.</HI> This having been &s;ent to me with a de&s;ire that I would give my judgment upon it, I immediately impannelled a jury of men of nice palates and &s;trong heads, who be|ing all of them very &s;crupulous, and unwilling to proceed ra&s;hly in a matter of &s;o great importance, refu&s;ed to bring in their verdict till three in the morning; at which time the foreman pronounced, as well as he was able, extra-a-ordinary French claret.

<P>Having mentioned this tribute of wine, I mu&s;t give notice to my corre&s;pondents for the future, who &s;hall ap|ply to me on this occa&s;ion, that as I &s;hall decide nothing unadvi&s;edly in matters of this nature, I cannot pretend to give judgment of a right good liquor, without examin|ing at lea&s;t three dozen bottles of it. I mu&s;t at the &s;ame time do my&s;elf the ju&s;tice to let the world know, that I have re&s;i&s;ted great temptations in this kind; as it is well known to a butcher in Clare-Market, who endeavoured to corrupt me with a dozen and a half of marrow-bones. I had likewi&s;e a bribe &s;ent me by a fi&s;h-monger, con&s;i&s;ting of a collar of brawn, and a joll of &s;almon; but not find|ing them excellent in their kinds, I had the integrity to eat them both up without &s;peaking one word of them. However, for the future, I &s;hall have an eye to the diet of this great city, and will recommend the be&s;t and mo&s;t whole&s;ome food to them, if I receive the&s;e proper and re|&s;pectful notices from the &s;ellers, that it may not be &s;aid hereafter my readers were better taught than fed.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own apartment, <DATE>March 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING intimated in my la&s;t paper, that I de&s;ign to take under my in&s;pection the diet of this great city, I &s;hall begin with a very earne&s;t and &s;erious exhortation to all my well-di&s;po&s;ed readers, that they would return to the food of their forefathers, and reconcile them&s;elves to beef and mutton. This was that diet which bred that hardy race of mortals who won the fields of Cre&s;&s;y and Agincourt. I need not go up &s;o high as the hi&s;tory of Guy earl of Warwick, who is well known to have eat|en up a dun cow of his own killing. The renowned king Arthur is generally looked upon as the fir&s;t who ever &s;at down to a whole roa&s;ted ox, which was certainly the be&s;t way to pre&s;erve the gravy; and it is further ad|ded, that he and his knights &s;at about it at his round table, and u&s;ually con&s;umed it to the very bones before they would enter upon any debate of moment. The Black prince was a profe&s;&s;ed lover of the bri&s;ket; not to men|tion the hi&s;tory of the &s;irloin, or the in&s;titution of the order of beef-eaters, which are all &s;o many evident and undeniable marks of the great re&s;pect which our warlike predece&s;&s;ors have paid to this excellent food. The tables of the ancient gentry of this nation were covered thrice a day with hot roa&s;t beef; and I am credibly informed by an antiquary who has &s;earched the regi&s;ters in which the bills of fare of the court are recorded, that in&s;tead of tea, and bread and butter, which have prevailed of late years, the maids of honour in queen Elizabeth's time were allowed three rumps of beef for their breakfa&s;t. Mutton has likewi&s;e been in great repute among our valiant country|men, but was formerly ob&s;erved to be the food rather of men of nice and delicate appetites, than tho&s;e of &s;trong
<PB N="122" REF="125">
and robu&s;t con&s;titutions. For which rea&s;on, even to this day, we u&s;e the word &s;heep-biter as a term of reproach, as we do beef-eater in a re&s;pectful and honourable &s;en&s;e. As for the fle&s;h of lamb, veal, chicken, and other animals under age, they were the invention of &s;ickly and degene|rate palates, according to that whole&s;ome remark of Da|niel the hi&s;torian, who takes notice, That in all taxes up|on provi&s;ions, during the reigns of &s;everal of our kings, there is nothing mentioned be&s;ides the fle&s;h of &s;uch fowl and cattle as were arrived at their full growth, and were ma|ture for &s;laughter. The common people of this kingdom do &s;till keep up the ta&s;te of their ance&s;tors; and it is to this that we in a great mea&s;ure owe the unparalleled victories that have been gained in this reign: for I would de&s;ire my reader to con&s;ider, what work our countrymen would have made at Blenheim and Ramillies, if they had been fed with fricacies and ragou&s;ts.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on we at pre&s;ent &s;ee the florid complexi|on, the &s;trong limb, and the hale con&s;titution, are to be found chiefly among the meaner &s;ort of people, or in the wild gentry, who have been educated among the woods and mountains: whereas many great families are in&s;en&s;i|bly fallen off from the athletic con&s;titution of their pro|genitors, and are dwindled away into a pale, &s;ickly, &s;pin|dle-legged, generation of valetudinarians.</P>
<P>I may perhaps be thought extravagant in my notion; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am apt to impute the di&s;honours that &s;ometimes happen in great families to the inflaming kind of diet which is &s;o much in fa&s;hion. Many di&s;hes can excite de&s;ire without giving &s;trength, and heat the body vithout nouri&s;hing it: as phy&s;icians ob&s;erve, that the poore&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;pirited blood is mo&s;t &s;ubject to fevers. I look upon a French ragou&s;t to be as pernicious to the &s;tomach as a gla&s;s of &s;pirits; and when I have &s;een a young lady &s;wallow all the in&s;tigations of high &s;oupes, &s;ea&s;oned &s;auces, and forced meats, I have won|dered at the de&s;pair or tedious &s;ighing of her lovers.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="126">
The rules among the&s;e fal&s;e delicates, are to be as con|tradictory as they can be to nature.</P>
<P>Without expecting the return of hunger, they eat for appetite, and prepare di&s;hes not to allay, but to excite it.</P>
<P>They admit of nothing at their tables in its natural form, or without &s;ome di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>They are to eat every thing before it comes in &s;ea&s;on, and to leave it off as &s;oon as it is good to be eaten.</P>
<P>They are not to approve any thing that is agreeable to ordinary palates; and nothing is to gratify their &s;en&s;es, but what would offend tho&s;e of their inferiors.</P>
<P>I remember I was la&s;t &s;ummer invited to a friend's hou&s;e, who is a great admirer of the French cookery, and, as the phra&s;e is, <HI>eats well.</HI> At our &s;itting down, I found the table covered with a great variety of unknown di&s;hes. I was mightily at a lo&s;s to learn what they were, and therefore did not know where to help my&s;elf. That which &s;tood before me I took to be a roa&s;ted porcupine, however did not care for a&s;king que&s;tions: and have &s;ince been informed, that it was only a larded turkey. I afterwards pa&s;&s;ed my eye over &s;everal ha&s;hes, which I do not know the names of to this day; and hearing that they were delicacies, did not think fit to meddle with them.</P>
<P>Among other dainties, I &s;aw &s;omething like a phea|&s;ant, and therefore de&s;ired to be helped to a wing of it; but to my great &s;urprize, my friend told me it was a rab|bet, which is a &s;ort of meat I never cared for. At la&s;t I di&s;covered, with &s;ome joy, a pig at the lower end of the table, and begged a gentleman that was near to cut me a piece of it. Upon which the gentleman of the hou&s;e &s;aid with great civility, I am &s;ure you will like the pig, for it was whipped to death. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I heard him with horror, and could not eat of an animal that had died &s;uch a tragical death: I was now in great hunger and confu&s;ion, when, methought, I &s;melled the agreeable &s;a|vour of roa&s;t-beef, but could not tell from which di&s;h it aro&s;e, though I did not que&s;tion but it lay di&s;gui&s;ed in one
<PB N="124" REF="127">
of them. Upon turning my head, I &s;aw a noble &s;irloin on the &s;ide-table &s;moking in the mo&s;t delicious manner. I had recour&s;e to it more than once, and could not &s;ee, without &s;ome indignation, that &s;ub&s;tantial Engli&s;h di&s;h bani&s;hed in &s;o ignominious a manner, to make way for French kick&s;haws.</P>
<P>The de&s;&s;ert was brought up at la&s;t, which in truth was as extraordinary as any thing that had come before it. The whole, when ranged in its proper order, looked like a very beautiful winter-piece. There were &s;everal pyra|mids of candyed &s;weetmeats, that hung like icicles, with fruits &s;cattered up and down, and hid in an artificial kind of fro&s;t. At the &s;ame time there were great quan|tities of cream beaten up into a &s;now, and near them lit|tle plates of &s;ugar-plumbs, di&s;po&s;ed like &s;o many heaps of hail-&s;tones, with a multitude of congelations in jel|lies of various colours. I was indeed &s;o plea&s;ed with the &s;everal objects which lay before me, that I did not care for di&s;placing any of them, and was half angry with the re&s;t of the company, that for the &s;ake of a piece of lemmon-peel, or a &s;ugar-plumb, would &s;poil &s;o plea&s;ing a picture. In|deed, I could not but &s;mile to &s;ee &s;everal of them cooling their mouths with lumps of ice, which they had ju&s;t be|fore been burning with &s;alts and peppers.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as this &s;how was over I took my leave, that I might fini&s;h my dinner at my own hou&s;e: for as I in every thing love what is &s;imple and natural, &s;o particular|ly in my &s;ood; two plain di&s;hes, with two or three good|natured, chearful, ingenious friends, would make me more plea&s;ed and vain, than all that pomp and luxury can be&s;tow. For it is my maxim, that <HI>he keeps the greate&s;t table, who has the mo&s;t valuable company at it.</HI></P>

<P>A MAN, who confines his &s;peculations to the time pre|&s;ent, has but a very narrow province to employ his thoughts in. For this rea&s;on, per&s;ons of &s;tudious and contemplative natures often entertain them&s;elves with the hi&s;tory of pa&s;t ages, or rai&s;e &s;chemes and conjectures upon futurity. For my own part, I love to range through that half of eternity which is &s;till to come, rather than look on that which is already run out; becau&s;e I know I have a real &s;hare and intere&s;t in the one, whereas all that was tran&s;acted in the other can be only matter of cu|rio&s;ity to me.</P>
<P>Upon this account, I have been always very much de|lighted with meditating on the &s;oul's immortality, and in reading the &s;everal notions which the wi&s;e&s;t of men, both ancient and modern, have entertained on that &s;ub|ject. What the opinions of the greate&s;t philo&s;ophers have been, I have &s;everal times hinted at, and &s;hall give an account of them from time to time as occa&s;ion requires. It may likewi&s;e be worth while to con&s;ider, what men of the mo&s;t exalted genius, and elevated imagination, have thought of this matter. Among the&s;e, Homer &s;tands up as a prodigy of mankind, that looks down upon the re&s;t of human creatures as a &s;pecies beneath him. Since he is the mo&s;t ancient heathen author, we may gue&s;s from his relation, what were the common opinions in his time concerning the &s;tate of the &s;oul after death.</P>
<P>Uly&s;&s;es, he tells us, made a voyage to the regions of the dead, in order to con&s;ult Tire&s;ias how he &s;hould re|turn to his own country, and recommend him&s;elf to the
<PB N="126" REF="129">
favour of the gods. The poet &s;carce introduces a &s;ingle per&s;on, who doth not &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome u&s;eful precept to his reader, and de&s;igns his de&s;cription of the dead for the amendment of the living.</P>
<P>Uly&s;&s;es, after having made a very plenteous &s;acrifice, &s;at him down by the pool of holy blood, which attracted a prodigious a&s;&s;embly of gho&s;ts of all ages and conditi|ons, that hovered about the hero, and fea&s;ted upon the &s;teams of his oblation. The fir&s;t he knew, was the &s;hade of Elpenor, who, to &s;hew the activity of a &s;pirit a|bove that of body, is repre&s;ented as arrived there long before Uly&s;&s;es, notwith&s;tanding the winds and &s;eas had contributed all their force to ha&s;ten his voyage thither. This Elpenor, to in&s;pire the reader with a dete&s;tation of drunkenne&s;s, and at the &s;ame time with a religious care of doing proper honours to the dead, de&s;cribes him&s;elf as hav|ing broken his neck in a debauch of wine; and begs Uly&s;|&s;es, that for the repo&s;e of his &s;oul, he would build a mo|nument over him, and perform funeral rites to his me|mory. Uly&s;&s;es with great &s;orrow of heart promi&s;es to ful|fil his reque&s;t, and is immediately diverted to an object much more moving than the former. The gho&s;t of his own mother Anticlea, whom he &s;till thought living, appears to him among the multitudes of &s;hades that &s;urrounded him, and &s;its down at a &s;mall di&s;tance from him by the lake of blood, without &s;peaking to him, or knowing who he was. Uly&s;&s;es was exceedingly troubled at the &s;ight, and could not forbear weeping as he looked upon her: but being all a|long &s;et forth as a pattern of con&s;ummate wi&s;dom, he makes his affection give way to prudence; and therefore, upon his &s;eeing Tire&s;ias, does not reveal him&s;elf to his mother, till he had con&s;ulted that great prophet, who was the occa|&s;ion of this his de&s;cent into the empire of the dead. Tire&s;ias having cautioned him to keep him&s;elf and his compani|ons free from the guilt of &s;acrilege, and to pay his devo|tions to all the gods, promi&s;es him a return to his king|dom and family, and a happy old-age in the enjoyment of them.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="130">
The poet having thus with great art kept the curio&s;i|ty of his reader in &s;u&s;pence, repre&s;ents his wife man, after the di&s;patch of his bu&s;ine&s;s with Tire&s;ias, as yielding him|&s;elf up to the calls of natural affection, and making him|&s;elf known to his mother. Her eyes were no &s;ooner o|pened, but &s;he cries out in tears, <HI>Oh my &s;on!</HI> and en|quires into the occa&s;ions that brought him thither, and the fortune that attended him.</P>
<P>Uly&s;&s;es on the other hand de&s;ires to know, what the &s;ickne&s;s was that had &s;ent her into tho&s;e regions, and the condition in which &s;he had left his father, his &s;on, and more particularly his wife. She tells him, they were all three incon&s;olable for his ab&s;ence; <HI>and as for my&s;elf,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>That was the &s;ickne&s;s of which I died. My impatience for your return, my anxiety for your welfare, and my fondne&s;s for my dear Uly&s;&s;es, were the only di&s;tempers that preyed up|on my life, and &s;eparated my &s;oul from my body.</HI> Uly&s;&s;es was melted with the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s, and thrice endeavoured to catch the apparition in his arms, that he might hold his mother to his bo&s;om and weep over her.</P>
<P>This gives the poet occa&s;ion to de&s;cribe the notion the heathens at that time had of an unbodied &s;oul, in the excu&s;e which the mother makes for &s;eeming to with|draw her&s;elf from her &s;on's embraces. <HI>The &s;oul,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>is compo&s;ed neither of bones, fle&s;h, nor &s;inews, but leaves be|hind her all tho&s;e incumbrances of mortality to be con&s;umed on the funeral pile. As &s;oon as &s;he hath thus ca&s;t her burden, &s;he makes her e&s;cape, and flies away from it like a dream.</HI></P>
<P>When this melancholy conver&s;ation is at an end, the poet draws up to view as charming a vi&s;ion as could en|ter into man's imagination. He de&s;cribes the next who appeared to Uly&s;&s;es, to have been the &s;hades of the fine&s;t women that had ever lived upon the earth, and who had either been the daughters of kings, the mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of gods, or mothers of heroes; &s;uch as Antiope, Alcmena, Leda, Ariadne, Iphimedia, Eriphyle, and &s;everal others of whom he gives a catalogue, with a &s;hort hi&s;tory of their adven|tures. The beautiful a&s;&s;embly of apparitions were all ga|thered
<PB N="128" REF="131">
together about the blood: each of them, &s;ays U|ly&s;&s;es, as a gentle &s;atire upon female vanity, <HI>giving me an account of her birth and family.</HI> This &s;cene of extraordina|ry women &s;eems to have been de&s;igned by the poet as a lecture of mortality to the whole &s;ex, and to put them in mind of what they mu&s;t expect, notwith&s;tanding the great|e&s;t perfections, and highe&s;t honours, they can arrive at.</P>
<P>The circle of beauties at length di&s;appeared, and was &s;ucceeded by the &s;hades of &s;everal Grecian heroes who had been engaged with Uly&s;&s;es in the &s;iege of Troy. The fir&s;t that approached was Agamemnon, the generali&s;&s;imo of that great expedition, who at the appearance of his old friend wept very bitterly, and without &s;aying any thing to him, endeavoured to gra&s;p him by the hand. Uly&s;&s;es, who was much moved at the &s;ight, poured out a flood of tears, and a&s;ked him the occa&s;ion of his death, which Agamemnon related to him in all its tragical cir|cum&s;tances; how he was murdered at a banquet by the contrivance of his own wife, in confederacy with her a|dulterer: from whence he takes occa&s;ion to reproach the whole &s;ex, after a manner which would be inexcu&s;able in a man who had not been &s;o great a &s;ufferer by them. <HI>My wife,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>has di&s;graced all the women that &s;hall e|ver be born into the world, even tho&s;e who hereafter &s;hall be innocent. Take care how you grow too fond of your wife. Never tell her all you know. If you reveal &s;ome things to her, be &s;ure you keep others concealed from her. You indeed have nothing to fear from your Penelope, &s;he will not u&s;e you as my wife has treated me; however, take care how you tru&s;t a woman.</HI> The poet, in this and other in&s;tances, ac|cording to the &s;y&s;tem of many Heathen as well as Chri|&s;tian philo&s;ophers, &s;hews, how anger, revenge, and other habits which the &s;oul had contracted in the body, &s;ub&s;i&s;t and grow in it under its &s;tate of &s;eparation.</P>
<P>I am extremely plea&s;ed with the companions which the poet in the next de&s;cription a&s;&s;igns to Achilles. <HI>A|chilles,</HI> &s;ays the hero, <HI>came up to me with Patroclus and Antilochus.</HI> By which we may &s;ee that it was Homer's o|pinion,
<PB N="129" REF="132">
and probably that of the age he lived in, that the friend&s;hips which are made among the living, will like|wi&s;e continue among the dead. Achilles enquires after the welfare of his &s;on, and of his father, with a fierce|ne&s;s of the &s;ame character that Homer has every where expre&s;&s;ed in the actions of his life. The pa&s;&s;age relating to his &s;on is &s;o extremely beautiful, that I mu&s;t not omit it. Uly&s;&s;es, after having de&s;cribed him as wife in coun|cil and active in war, and mentioned the foes whom he had &s;lain in battle, adds an ob&s;ervation that he him&s;elf had made of his behaviour whil&s;t he lay in the wooden hor&s;e. <HI>Mo&s;t of the generals,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that were with us, either wept or trembled: as for your &s;on, I never &s;aw him wipe a tear from his cheeks, or change his countenance. On the contrary, he would often lay his hand upon his &s;word, or gra&s;p his &s;pear, as impatient to employ them again&s;t the Trojans.</HI> He then informs his father of the great honour and rewards which he had purcha&s;ed before Troy, and of his return from it without a wound. The &s;hade of Achil|les, &s;ays the poet, was &s;o plea&s;ed with the account he received of his &s;on, that he enquired no further, but &s;talked away with more than ordinary maje&s;ty over the green meadow that lay before them.</P>
<P>This la&s;t circum&s;tance of a decea&s;ed father's rejoicing in the behaviour of his &s;on, is very finely contrived by Homer, as an incentive to virtue, and made u&s;e of by none that I know be&s;ides him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription of Ajax, which follows, and his re|fu&s;ing to &s;peak to Uly&s;&s;es, who had won the armour of A|chilles from him, and by that means occa&s;ioned his death, is admired by every one that reads it. When Uly&s;&s;es re|lates the &s;ullenne&s;s of his deportment, and con&s;iders the greatne&s;s of the hero, he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with generous and noble &s;entiments. <HI>Oh! that I had never gained a prize which co&s;t the life of &s;o brave a man as Ajax! who, for the beauty of his per&s;on, and greatne&s;s of his actions, was infe|rior to none but the divine Achilles.</HI> The &s;ame noble con|de&s;cen&s;ion, which never dwells but in truly great minds,
<PB N="130" REF="133">
and &s;uch as Homer would repre&s;ent that of Uly&s;&s;es to have been, di&s;covers it&s;elf likewi&s;e in the &s;peech which he made to the gho&s;t of Ajax on that occa&s;ion. <HI>Oh Ajax!</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Will you keep your re&s;entment even after death? what de&s;tructions hath this fatal armour brought upon the Greeks by robbing them of you, who was their bulwark and defence? Achilles is not more bitterly lamented among us than you. Impute not then your death to any one but Jupi|ter, who out of his anger to the Greeks, took you away from among them: let me entreat you to approach me; re&s;train the fiercene&s;s of your wrath, and the greatne&s;s of your &s;oul. and hear what I have to &s;ay to you.</HI> Ajax, without making any reply, turned his back upon him, and retired into a croud of gho&s;ts.</P>
<P>Uly&s;&s;es, after all the&s;e vi&s;ions, took a view of tho&s;e impious wretches who lay in tortures for the crimes they had committed upon the earth, whom he de&s;cribes under all the varieties of pain, as &s;o many marks of divine ven|geance, to deter others from following their example. He then tells us, that notwith&s;tanding he had a great curio&s;i|ty to &s;ee the heroes that lived in the ages before him, the gho&s;ts began to gather about him in &s;uch prodigious multitudes, and with &s;uch confu&s;ion of voices, that his heart trembled as he &s;aw him&s;elf amid&s;t &s;o great a &s;cene of horrors. He adds, that he was afraid le&s;t &s;ome hideous &s;pectre &s;hould appear to him, that might terrify him to di&s;traction; and therefore withdrew in time.</P>
<P>I que&s;tion not but my reader will be plea&s;ed with this de&s;cription of a future &s;tate, repre&s;ented by &s;uch a noble and fruitful imagination, that had nothing to direct it be|&s;ides the light of nature, and the opinions of a dark and ignorant age.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own apartment, <DATE>March 31.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE heard of a very valuable picture, wherein all the painters of the age in which it was drawn, are re|pre&s;ented &s;itting together in a circle, and joining in a con|cert of mu&s;ic. Each of them plays upon &s;uch a particular in&s;trument as is the mo&s;t &s;uitable to his character, and ex|pre&s;&s;es that &s;tile and manner of painting which is pecu|liar to him. The famous cupola-painter of tho&s;e times, to &s;hew the grandeur and boldne&s;s of his figures, hath a horn in his mouth, which he &s;eems to wind with great &s;trength and force. On the contrary, an eminent arti&s;t, who wrought up his pictures with the greate&s;t accuracy, and gave them all tho&s;e delicate touches which are apt to plea&s;e the nice&s;t eye, is repre&s;ented as tuning a theorbo. The &s;ame kind of humour runs through the whole piece.</P>
<P>I have often from this hint imagined to my&s;elf, that different talents in di&s;cour&s;e might be &s;hadowed out after the &s;ame manner by different kinds of mu&s;ic; and that the &s;everal conver&s;able parts of mankind in this great city might be ca&s;t into the proper characters and divi&s;ions, as they re&s;emble &s;everal in&s;truments that are in u&s;e among the ma&s;ters of harmony. Of the&s;e therefore in their or|der, and fir&s;t of the drum.</P>
<P>Your drums are the blu&s;terers in conver&s;ation, that with a loud laugh, unnatural mirth, and a torrent of noi&s;e, domineer in public a&s;&s;emblies, over-bear men of &s;en&s;e, &s;tun their companions, and fill the place they are in with a ratling &s;ound, that hath &s;eldom any wit, humour, or good breeding in it. The drum notwith&s;tanding, by this boi&s;terous vivacity, is very proper to impo&s;e upon the ignorant; and in conver&s;ation with ladies, who are not of the &s;ine&s;t ta&s;te, often pa&s;&s;es for a man of mirth and wit,
<PB N="132" REF="135">
for wonderful plea&s;ant company. I need not ob&s;erve, that the emptine&s;s of the drum very much contributes to its noi&s;e.</P>
<P>The lute is a character directly oppo&s;ite to the drum, that &s;ounds very finely by it&s;elf or in a very &s;mall concert. Its notes are exqui&s;itely &s;weet, and very low, ea&s;ily drown|ed in a multitude of in&s;truments, and even lo&s;t among a few, unle&s;s you give a particular attention to it. A lute is &s;eldom heard in a company of more than five, whereas a drum will &s;hew it&s;elf to advantage in an a&s;&s;embly of five hundred. The lutani&s;ts therefore are men of a fine genius, uncommon reflection, great affability, and e&s;teemed chief|ly by per&s;ons of a good ta&s;te, who are the only proper judges of &s;o delightful and &s;oft a melody.</P>
<P>The trumpet is an in&s;trument that has in it no com|pa&s;s of mu&s;ic, or variety of &s;ound, but is notwith&s;tanding very agreeable, &s;o long as it keeps within its pitch. It has not above four or five notes, which are however very plea&s;ing, and capable of exqui&s;ite turns and modulations. The gentlemen, who fall under this denomination, are your men of the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable education and refined breed|ing, who have learned a certain &s;moothne&s;s of di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;prightline&s;s of air, from the polite company they have kept; but at the &s;ame time have &s;hallow parts, weak judgments, and a &s;hort reach of under&s;tanding; a play|hou&s;e, a drawing-room, a ball, a vi&s;iting day, or a ring at Hide-park, are the few notes they are ma&s;ters of, which they touch upon in all conver&s;ations. The trumpet how|ever is a nece&s;&s;ary in&s;trument about a court, and a pro|per enlivener of a concert, though of no great harmony by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Violins are the lively, forward, importunate wits, that di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by the flouri&s;hes of imagination, &s;harpne&s;s of repartee, glances of &s;atire, and bear away the upper part in every concert. I cannot however but ob|&s;erve, that when a man is not di&s;po&s;ed to hear mu&s;ic, there is not a more di&s;agreeable &s;ound in harmony than that of a violin.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="136">
There is another mu&s;ical in&s;trument, which is more frequent in this nation than any other; I mean your ba&s;s-viol, which grumbles in the bottom of the concert, and with a &s;urly ma&s;culine &s;ound &s;trengthens the harmony, and tempers the &s;weetne&s;s of the &s;everal in&s;truments that play along with it. The ba&s;s-viol is an in&s;trument of a quite different nature to the trumpet, and may &s;ignify men of rough &s;en&s;e, and unpoli&s;hed parts, who do not love to hear them&s;elves talk, but &s;ometimes break out with an agreeable bluntne&s;s, unexpected wit, and &s;urly plea|&s;antries, to the no &s;mall diver&s;ion of their friends and companions. In &s;hort, I look upon every &s;en&s;ible true|born Briton to be naturally a ba&s;s-viol.</P>
<P>As for your rural wits, who talk with great eloquence and alacrity of foxes, hounds, hor&s;es, quick-&s;et-hedges, and &s;ix-bar-gates, double ditches, and broken necks, I am in doubt, whether I &s;hould give them a place in the con|ver&s;able world. However, if they will content them&s;elves with being rai&s;ed to the dignity of hunting-horns, I &s;hall de&s;ire for the future that they may be known by that name.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not here omit the bagpipe &s;pecies, that will entertain you from morning to night with the repetiti|on of a few notes, which are played over and over, with the perpetual humming of a drone running underneath them. The&s;e are your dull, heavy, tedious &s;tory-tellers, the load and burden of conver&s;ations, that &s;et up for men of importance, by knowing &s;ecret hi&s;tory, and giv|ing an account of tran&s;actions, that whether they ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in the world or not, doth not &s;ignify a half-penny <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> its in&s;truction, or its welfare. Some have ob&s;erved, that the Northern parts of this i&s;land are more particular|ly fruitful in bagpipes.</P>
<P>There are &s;o very few per&s;ons who are ma&s;ters in every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of conver&s;ation, and can talk on all &s;ubjects, that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> know whether we &s;hould make a di&s;tinct &s;pecies of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> neverthele&s;s, that my &s;cheme may not be defective, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> of tho&s;e few who are endowed with &s;uch ex|traordinary
<PB N="134" REF="137">
talents, I &s;hall allow them to be harp&s;icords, a kind of mu&s;ic which every one knows is a concert by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>As for your pa&s;&s;age-bells, who look upon mirth as cri|minal, and talk of nothing but what is melancholy in it|&s;elf and mortifying to human nature, I &s;hall not mention them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall likewi&s;e pa&s;s over in &s;ilence all the rabble of man|kind, that croud our &s;treets, coffee-hou&s;es, fea&s;ts, and public tables. I cannot call their di&s;cour&s;e conver&s;ation, but rather &s;omething that is practi&s;ed in imitation of it. For which rea&s;on, if I would de&s;cribe them by any mu&s;ical in&s;trument, it &s;hould be by tho&s;e modern inven|tions of the bladder and &s;tring, tongs and key, marrow|bone and cleaver.</P>
<P>My reader will doubtle&s;s ob&s;erve, that I have only touched here upon male in&s;truments, having re&s;erved my female concert to another occa&s;ion. If he has a mind to know where the&s;e &s;everal characters are to be met with, I could direct him to a whole club of drums; not to menti|on another of bagpipes, which I have before given &s;ome account of in my de&s;cription of our nightly meetings in Sheer-Lane. The lutes may often be met with in couples upon the banks of a chry&s;tal &s;tream, or in the retreats of &s;hady woods and &s;lowery meadows; which for different rea&s;ons are likewi&s;e the great re&s;ort of your hunting-horns. Ba&s;s-viols are frequently to be found over a gla&s;s of &s;tale|beer, and a pipe of tobacco, whereas tho&s;e who &s;et up for violins, &s;eldom fail to make their appearance at Will's once every evening. You may meet with a trumpet any where on the other &s;ide of Charing-cro&s;s.</P>
<P>That we may draw &s;omething for our advantage in life out of the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e, I mu&s;t intreat my rea|der to make a narrow &s;earch into his life and conver&s;a|tion, and upon his leaving any company, to examine him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly, whether he has behaved him&s;elf in it like a dram or a trumpet, a violin or a ba&s;s-viol; and ac|cordingly endeavour to mend his mu&s;ic for the future.
<PB N="135" REF="138">
For my own part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was a drum for ma|ny years; nay, and a noi&s;y one, till having poli&s;hed my|&s;elf a little in good company, I threw as much of the trum|pet into my conver&s;ation as was po&s;&s;ible for a man of an impetuous temper, by which mixture of different mu|&s;ics, I look upon my&s;elf, during the cour&s;e of many years, to have re&s;embled a tabor and pipe. I have &s;ince very much endeavoured at the &s;weetne&s;s of the lute; but in &s;pite of all my re&s;olutions, I mu&s;t confe&s;s with great con|fu&s;ion, that I find my&s;elf daily degenerating into a bag|pipe; whether it be the effect of my old-age, or of the com|pany I keep, I know not. All that I can do, is to keep a watch over my conver&s;ation, and to &s;ilence the drone as &s;oon as I find it begin to hum in my di&s;cour&s;e, being determinated rather to hear the notes of others, than to play out of time, and encroach upon their parts in the concert by the noi&s;e of &s;o tire&s;ome an in&s;trument.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this paper with a letter which I receiv|ed la&s;t night from a friend of mine who knows very well my notions upon this &s;ubject, and invites me to pa&s;s the evening at his hou&s;e, with a &s;elect company of friends, in the following words:

<P>WE have already examined Homer's de&s;cription of a future &s;tate, and the condition in which he hath placed the &s;ouls of the decea&s;ed. I &s;hall in this paper make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the account which Virgil hath given us of the &s;ame &s;ubject, who, be&s;ides a greatne&s;s of genius, had all the lights of philo&s;ophy and human learning to a&s;&s;i&s;t and guide him in his di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>Aeneas is repre&s;ented as de&s;cending into the empire of death, with a prophete&s;s by his &s;ide, who in&s;tructs him in the &s;ecrets of tho&s;e lower regions.</P>
<P>Upon the confines of the dead, and before the very gates of this in&s;ernal world, Virgil de&s;cribes &s;everal inha|bitants, who&s;e natures are wonderfully &s;uited to the &s;itu|ation of the place, as being either the occa&s;ions, or re|&s;emblances of death. Of the fir&s;t kind are the &s;hadows of Sickne&s;s, Old-age, Fear, Famine, and Poverty, apparitions very terrible to behold; with &s;everal others, as Toil, War, Contention, and Di&s;cord, which contribute all of them to people this common receptacle of human &s;ouls. As this was likewi&s;e a very proper re&s;idence for every thing that re&s;embles Death, the poet tells us that Sleep, whom he repre&s;ents as a near relation to Death, has likewi&s;e his habitation in the&s;e quarters, and de&s;cribes in them a huge gloomy elm-tree, which &s;eems a very proper ornament for the place, and is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an innumerable &s;warm of Dreams, that hang in clu&s;ters under every leaf of it. He then gives us a li&s;t of imaginary per&s;ons, who very na|turally ly within the &s;hadow of the Dream-tree, as being of the &s;ame kind of make in them&s;elves, and the materials, or, to u&s;e Shake&s;pear's phra&s;e, the &s;tuff of which dreams are made. Such are the &s;hades of the giant with a hun|dred hands, and of his brother with three bodies; of the
<PB N="137" REF="140">
double-&s;haped Centaur, and Scylla; the Gorgon with &s;nakey hair; the Harpy with a woman's face and lion's talons; the &s;even-headed Hydra; and the Chimaera, which breathes forth a flame, and is a compound of three animals. The&s;e &s;everal mixed natures, the creatures of imagination, are not only introduced with great art after the dreams; but as they are planted at the very en|trance, and within the very gates of tho&s;e regions, do probably denote the wild deliriums and extravagancies of fancy, which the &s;oul u&s;ually falls into when &s;he is ju&s;t upon the verge of death.</P>
<P>Thus far Aeneas travels in an allegory. The re&s;t of the de&s;cription is drawn with great exactne&s;s, according to the religion of the heathens, and the opinions of the Platonic philo&s;ophy. I &s;hall not trouble my reader with a common dull &s;tory, that gives an account why the heathens fir&s;t of all &s;uppo&s;ed a ferryman in hell, and his name to be Charon; but mu&s;t not pa&s;s over in &s;ilence the point of doctrine which Virgil hath very much in|&s;i&s;ted upon in this book, that the &s;ouls of tho&s;e, who are unburied, are not permitted to go over into their re&s;pe|ctive places of re&s;t, till they have wandered a hundred years upon the banks of Styx. This was probably an inven|tion of the heathen prie&s;thood, to make the people ex|tremely careful of performing proper rites and ceremo|nies to the memory of the dead. I &s;hall not however, with the infamous &s;criblers of the age, take an occa&s;ion from &s;uch a circum&s;tance, to run into declamations again&s;t prie&s;tcraft, but rather look upon it even in this light as a religious artifice, to rai&s;e in the minds of men an e&s;teem for the memory of their &s;orefathers, and a de&s;ire to re|commend them&s;elves to that of po&s;terity; as al&s;o to ex|cite in them an ambition of imitating the virtues of the decea&s;ed, and to keep alive in their thoughts the &s;en&s;e of the &s;oul's immortality. In a word, we may &s;ay in defence of the &s;evere opinions relating to the &s;hades of unburied per&s;ons, what hath been &s;aid by &s;ome of our divines in re|gard to the rigid doctrines concerning the &s;ouls of &s;uch who
<PB N="138" REF="141">
die without being initiated into our religion, that &s;uppo&s;|ing they &s;hould be erroneous, they can do no hurt to the dead, and will have a good effect upon the living, in mak|ing them cautious of neglecting &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary &s;olemnities.</P>
<P>Charon is no &s;ooner appea&s;ed, and the triple-headed dog laid a&s;leep, but Aeneas makes his entrance into the do|minions of Pluto. There are three kinds of per&s;ons de&s;crib|ed, as being &s;ituated on the borders; and I can give no rea|&s;on for their being &s;tationed there in &s;o particular a man|ner, but becau&s;e none of them &s;eem to have had a proper right to a place among the dead, as not having run out the whole thread of their days, and fini&s;hed the term of life that had been allotted them upon earth. The fir&s;t of the&s;e are the &s;ouls of infants, who are &s;natched away by untimely ends: the &s;econd, are of tho&s;e that are put to death wrongfully, and by an unju&s;t &s;entence; and the third, of tho&s;e who grew weary of their lives and laid vio|lent hands upon them&s;elves. As for the &s;econd of the&s;e, Virgil adds with great beauty, that Minos, the judge of the dead, is employed in giving them a rehearing, and a&s;|&s;igning them their &s;everal quarters &s;uitable to the parts they acted in life. The poet, after having mentioned the &s;ouls of tho&s;e unhappy men who de&s;troyed them&s;elves, breaks out into a fine exclamation; <HI>Oh! how gladly,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>would they now endure life with all its mi&s;eries! But the De&s;tinies forbid their return to earth, and the waters of Styx &s;urround them with nine &s;treams that are unpa&s;&s;able.</HI> It is very re|markable, that Virgil notwith&s;tanding &s;elf-murder was &s;o frequent among the heathens, and had been practi&s;ed by &s;ome of the greate&s;t men in the very age before him, hath here repre&s;ented it as &s;o heinous a crime. But in this particular he was guided by the doctrines of his great ma&s;ter Plato, who &s;ays on this &s;ubject, that a man is placed in his &s;tation of life like a &s;oldier in his proper po&s;t, which he is not to quit whatever may happen, until he is called off by his commander who planted him in it.</P>
<P>There is another point in the Platonic philo&s;ophy, which Virgil has made the ground-work of the greate&s;t
<PB N="139" REF="142">
part of the piece we are now examining, having with wonderful art and beauty materialized, if I may &s;o call it, a &s;cheme of ab&s;tracted notions, and clothed the mo&s;t nice re&s;ined conceptions of philo&s;ophy in &s;en&s;ible images, and poetical repre&s;entations. The Platoni&s;ts tell us, that the &s;oul, during her re&s;idence in the body, contracts many virtuous and vicious habits, &s;o as to become a beneficent, mild, charitable, or an angry, malicious, revengeful being; a &s;ub&s;tance inflamed with lu&s;t, avarice, and pride; or, on the contrary, brightened with pure, generous, and hum|ble di&s;po&s;itions: that the&s;e and the like habits of virtue and vice, growing into the very e&s;&s;ence of the &s;oul, &s;urvive and gather &s;trength in her after her di&s;&s;olution: that the torments of a vicious &s;oul in a future &s;tate, ari&s;e princi|pally from tho&s;e importunate pa&s;&s;ions which are not capa|ble of being gratified without a body; and that on the con|trary, the happine&s;s of virtuous minds very much con&s;i&s;ts in their being employed in &s;ublime &s;peculations, innocent diver&s;ions, &s;ociable affections, and all the ec&s;ta&s;ies of pa&s;|&s;ion and rapture which are agreeable to rea&s;onable natures, and of which they gained a reli&s;h in this life.</P>
<P>Upon this foundation, the poet rai&s;es that beautiful de|&s;cription of the &s;ecret haunts and walks, which he tells us are inhabited by decea&s;ed lovers.</P>
<P>Not far from hence, &s;ays he, lies a great wa&s;te of plains that are called the Fields of Melancholy. In the&s;e there grows a fore&s;t of myrtle, divided into many &s;hady retirements and covered walks, and inhabited by the &s;ouls of tho&s;e who pined away with love. The pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ays he, continues with them after death. He then gives a li&s;t of this langui&s;hing tribe, in which his own Dido makes the principal figure, and is de&s;cribed as living in this &s;oft romantic &s;cene, with the &s;hade of her fir&s;t hu&s;|band Sichaeus.</P>
<P>The poet in the next place mentions another plain that was peopled with the gho&s;ts of warriors, as &s;till delight|ing in each others company and plea&s;ed with the exerci&s;e of arms. He there repre&s;ents the Grecian generals and
<PB N="140" REF="143">
common &s;oldiers who peri&s;hed in the &s;iege of Troy as drawn up in &s;quadrons, and terrified at the approach of Aeneas, which renewed in them tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions of fear they had before received in battle with the Trojans. He afterwards likewi&s;e, upon the &s;ame notion, gives a view of the Trojan heroes who lived in former ages, amid&s;t a vi&s;ionary &s;cene of chariots and arms, flowery meadows, &s;hining &s;pears, and generous &s;teeds, which he tells us were their plea&s;ures upon earth, and now make up their happine&s;s in Ely&s;ium. For the &s;ame rea&s;on al&s;o, he mentions others as &s;inging pae|ans, and &s;ongs of triumph, amid&s;t a beautiful grove of laurel. The chief of the concert was the poet Mu&s;aeus, who &s;tood inclo&s;ed with a circle of admirers, and ro&s;e by the head and &s;houlders above the throng of &s;hades that &s;urrounded him. The habitations of unhappy &s;pirits, to &s;hew the du|ration of their torments and the de&s;perate condition they are in, are repre&s;ented as guarded by a fury, moated round with a lake of fire, &s;trengthened with towers of iron, en|compa&s;&s;ed with a triple wall, and fortified with pillars of adamant, which all the gods together are not able to heave from their foundations. The noi&s;e of &s;tripes, the clank of chains, and the groans of the tortured, &s;trike the pious Aeneas with a kind of horror. The poet afterwards divides the criminals into two cla&s;&s;es: the fir&s;t and blacke&s;t cata|logue con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch as were guilty of outrages again&s;t the gods; and the next, of &s;uch who were convicted of inju&s;tice between man and man: the greate&s;t number of whom, &s;ays the poet, are tho&s;e who followed the dictates of avarice.</P>
<P>It was an opinion of the Platoni&s;ts, that the &s;ouls of men having contracted in the body great &s;tains and pol|lutions of vice and ignorance, there were &s;everal pur|gations and clean&s;ings nece&s;&s;ary to be pa&s;&s;ed through both here and hereafter, in order to refine and purify them.</P>
<P>Virgil, to give this thought likewi&s;e a clothing of poe|try, de&s;cribes &s;ome &s;pirits as bleaching in the winds, o|thers as clean&s;ing under great falls of waters, and others
<PB N="141" REF="144">
as purging in fire, to recover the primitive beauty and purity of their natures.</P>
<P>It was likewi&s;e an opinion of the &s;ame &s;ect of philo&s;o|phers, that the &s;ouls of all men exi&s;t in a &s;eparate &s;tate long before their union with the bodies; and that upon their immer&s;ion into fle&s;h, they forget every thing which pa&s;|&s;ed in the &s;tate of pre-exi&s;tence; &s;o that what we here call knowlege, is nothing el&s;e but memory, or the recovery of tho&s;e things which we knew before.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this &s;cheme, Virgil gives us a view of &s;everal &s;ouls, who, to prepare them&s;elves for living upon earth, flock about the banks of the river Lethe, and &s;will them&s;elves with the waters of oblivion.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;cheme gives him an opportunity of making a noble compliment to his countrymen, where Anchi&s;es is repre&s;ented taking a &s;urvey of the long train of heroes that are to de&s;cend from him, and giving his &s;on Aeneas an account of all the glories of his race.</P>
<P>I need not mention the revolution of the Platonic year, which is but ju&s;t touched upon in this book; and as I have con&s;ulted no author's thoughts in this explica|tion, &s;hall be very well plea&s;ed, if it can make the noble&s;t piece of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed poet more agreeable to my female readers, when they think fit to look into Dryden's tran&s;lation of it.</P>

<P>THERE lived &s;ome years &s;ince within my neighbour|hood a very grave per&s;on, an Uphol&s;terer, who &s;eemed a man of more than ordinary application to bu&s;ine&s;s. He was a very early ri&s;er, and was often abroad two or three hours before any of his neighbours. He had a particular
<PB N="142" REF="145">
carefulne&s;s in the knitting of his brows, and a kind of impatience in all his motions, that plainly di&s;covered he was always intent on matters of importance. Upon my enquiry into his life and conver&s;ation, I found him to be the greate&s;t new&s;monger in our quarter; that he ro&s;e up before day to read the Po&s;t-man; and that he would take two or three turns to the other end of the town before his neighbours were up, to &s;ee if there were any Dutch mails come in. He had a wife and &s;everal children; but was much more inqui&s;itive to know what pa&s;&s;ed in Po|land than in his own family, and was in greater pain and anxiety of mind for king Augu&s;tus's welfare than that of his neare&s;t relations. He looked extremely thin in a dearth of news, and never enjoyed him&s;elf in a we&s;terly wind. This indefatigable kind of life was the ruin of his &s;hop; for about the time that his favourite prince left the crown of Poland he broke and di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>This man and his affairs had been long out of my mind, till about three days ago, as I was walking in St. James's park, I heard &s;ome body at a di&s;tance hemming after me: and who &s;hould it be but my old neighbour the Uphol&s;terer! I &s;aw he was reduced to extreme poverty, by certain &s;habby &s;uperfluities in his dre&s;s: for notwith|&s;tanding that it was a very &s;ultry day for the time of the year, he wore a loo&s;e great coat and a muff, with a long campaign-wig out of curl; to which he had added the ornament of a pair of black garters buckled under the knee. Upon his coming up to me, I was going to enquire into his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances; but was prevented by his a&s;king me, with a whi&s;per, whether the la&s;t letters brought any accounts that one mght rely upon from Bender? I told him, none that I heard of; and a&s;ked him, whether he had yet married his elde&s;t daughter? He told me, no. But pray, &s;ays he, tell me &s;incerely, what are your thoughts of the king of Sweden? (for though his wife and children were &s;tarving, I found his chief concern at pre&s;ent was for this great monarch.) I told him, that I looked upon him as one of the fir&s;t heroes of the age. But pray, &s;ays he, do you
<PB N="143" REF="146">
think there is any thing in the &s;tory of his wound? and finding me &s;urprized at the que&s;tion, Nay, &s;ays he, I only propo&s;e it to you. I an&s;wered, that I thought there was no rea&s;on to doubt of it. But why in the heel, &s;ays he, more than in any other part of the body? Becau&s;e, &s;ays I, the bullet chanced to light there.</P>
<P>This extraordinary dialogue was no &s;ooner ended, but he began to launch out into a long di&s;&s;ertation upon the affairs of the North; and after having &s;pent &s;ome time on them, he told me, he was in a great perplexity how to reconcile the Supplement with the Engli&s;h-po&s;t, and had been ju&s;t now examining what the other papers &s;ay upon the &s;ame &s;ubject. The Daily-courant, &s;ays he, has the&s;e words, <HI>We have advices from very good hands, that a cer|tain prince has &s;ome matters of great importance under con|&s;ideration.</HI> This is very my&s;terious; but the Po&s;t-boy leaves us more in the dark, for he tells us, <HI>That there are private intimations of mea&s;ures taken by a certain prince, which time will bring to light.</HI> Now the Po&s;t-man, &s;ays he, who u&s;es to be very clear, refers to the &s;ame news in the&s;e words; <HI>The late conduct of a certain prince affords great matter of &s;peculation.</HI> This certain prince, &s;ays the uphol&s;terer, whom they are all &s;o cautious of naming, I take to be&mdash;Upon which, though there was no body near us, he whi&s;|pered &s;omething in my ear, which I did not hear, or think worth my while to make him repeat.</P>
<P>We were now got to the upper end of the Mall, where were three or four very odd fellows &s;itting together upon the bench. The&s;e I found were all of them politicians, who u&s;ed to &s;un them&s;elves, in that place every day a|bout dinner-time. Ob&s;erving them to be curio&s;ities in their kind, and my friend's acquaintance, I fat down a|mong them.</P>
<P>The chief politician of the bench was a great a&s;&s;erter of paradoxes. He told us, with a &s;eeming concern, that by &s;ome news he had lately read from Mu&s;covy, it ap|peared to him that there was a &s;torm gathering in the Black|&s;ea, which might in time do hurt to the naval forces of
<PB N="144" REF="147">
this nation. To this he added, that for his part, he could not wi&s;h to &s;ee the Turk driven out of Europe, which he believed could not but be prejudicial to our woollen ma|nufacture. He then told us, that he looked upon tho&s;e ex|traordinary revolutions which had lately happened in the&s;e parts of the world, to have ri&s;en chiefly from two per&s;ons who were not much talked of; and tho&s;e, &s;ays he, are prince Menzikoff, and the duche&s;s of Mirandola. He backed his a&s;&s;ertions with &s;o many broken hints, and &s;uch a &s;how of depth and wi&s;dom, that we gave our|&s;elves up to his opinions.</P>
<P>The di&s;cour&s;e at length fell upon a point which &s;el|dom e&s;capes a knot of true-born Engli&s;hmen, whether in ca&s;e of a religious war, the prote&s;tants would not be too &s;trong for the papi&s;ts? This we unanimou&s;ly determined on the prote&s;tants &s;ide. One who &s;ate on my right hand, and, as I found by his di&s;cour&s;e, had been in the We&s;t-Indies, a&s;&s;ured us, that it would be a very ea&s;y matter for the prote&s;tants to beat the pope at &s;ea; and added, that whenever &s;uch a war does break out, it mu&s;t turn to the good of the Leeward i&s;lands. Upon this, one who &s;at at the end of the bench, and, as I afterwards found, was the geographer of the company, &s;aid, that in ca&s;e the papi&s;ts &s;hould drive the prote&s;tants from the&s;e parts of Europe, when the wor&s;t came to the wor&s;t, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to beat them out of Norway and Greenland, provided the northern crowns hold together, and the Czar of Mu&s;covy &s;tand neuter.</P>
<P>He further told us for our comfort, that there were va&s;t tracts of land about the pole, inhabited neither by prote&s;tants nor papi&s;ts, and of greater extent than all the Roman catholic dominions in Europe.</P>
<P>When we had fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed this point, my friend the Uphol&s;terer began to exert him&s;elf upon the pre&s;ent ne|gotiations of peace, in which he depo&s;ed princes, &s;ettled the bounds of kingdoms, and balanced the power of Eu|rope, with great ju&s;tice and impartiality.</P>
<P>I at length took my leave of the company, and was
<PB N="145" REF="148">
going away; but had not been gone thirty yards, before the Uphol&s;terer hemmed again after me. Upon his advan|cing towards me, with a whi&s;per, I expected to hear &s;ome &s;ecret piece of news, which he had not thought fit to com|municate to the bench; but in&s;tead of that, he de&s;ired me in my ear to lend him half-a-crown. In compa&s;&s;ion to &s;o needy a &s;tate&s;man, and to di&s;&s;ipate the confu&s;ion I found he was in, I told him, if he plea&s;ed, I would give him five &s;hillings, to receive five pounds of him when the Great Turk was driven out of Con&s;tantinople; which he very readily accepted, but not before he had laid down to me the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch an event, as the affairs of Europe now &s;tand.</P>
<P>This paper I de&s;ign for the particular benefit of tho&s;e worthy citizens who live more in a coffee-hou&s;e than in their &s;hops, and who&s;e thoughts are &s;o taken up with the affairs of the allies, that they forget their cu&s;tomers.</P>

<P>WE have already de&s;cribed out of Homer the voyage of Uly&s;&s;es to the infernal &s;hades, with the &s;everal adventures that attended it. If we look into the beauti|ful romance publi&s;hed not many years &s;ince by the arch|bi&s;hop of Cambray, we may &s;ee the &s;on of Uly&s;&s;es bound on the &s;ame expedition, and after the &s;ame manner mak|ing his di&s;coveries among the regions of the dead. The &s;tory of Telemachus is formed altogether in the &s;pirit of Homer, and will give an unlearned reader a notion of that great poet's manner of writing, more than any tran&s;lation of him can po&s;&s;ibly do. As it was written for the in|&s;truction of a young prince, who may one day &s;it upon the throne of France, the author took care to &s;uit the &s;e|veral parts of his &s;tory, and particularly the de&s;cription
<PB N="146" REF="149">
we are now entering upon, to the character and quality of his pupil. For which rea&s;on, he in&s;i&s;ts very much on the mi&s;ery of bad, and the happine&s;s of good kings, in the account he hath given of puni&s;hments and rewards in the other world.</P>
<P>We may however ob&s;erve, notwith&s;tanding the en|deavours of this great and learned author, to copy after the &s;tile and &s;entiments of Homer, that there is a certain tincture of Chri&s;tianity running through the whole rela|tion. The prelate in &s;everal places mixes him&s;elf with the poet; &s;o that his future &s;tate puts me in mind of Mi|chael Angelo's la&s;t judgment, where Charon and his boat are repre&s;ented as bearing a part in the dreadful &s;olemni|ties of that great day.</P>
<P>Telemachus, after having pa&s;&s;ed through the dark ave|nues of death in the retinue of Mercury, who every day delivers up a certain tale of gho&s;ts to the ferryman of Styx, is admitted into the infernal bark. Among the com|panions of his voyage, is the &s;hade of Nabopharzon, a king of Babylon, and tyrant of all the Ea&s;t. Among the ceremonies and pomps of his funeral, there were four &s;laves &s;acrificed, according to the cu&s;tom of the country, in order to attend him among the &s;hades. The author having de&s;cribed this tyrant in the mo&s;t odious colours of pride, in&s;olence, and cruelty, tells us, that his four &s;laves, in&s;tead of &s;erving him after death, were perpetually in&s;ulting him with reproaches and affronts for his pa&s;t u|&s;age; that they &s;purned him as he lay upon the ground, and forced him to &s;how his face, which he would fain have covered, as lying under all the confu&s;ions of guilt and infamy; and in &s;hort, that they kept him bound in a chain, in order to drag him before the tribunal of the dead.</P>
<P>Telemachus, upon looking out of the bark, &s;ees all the &s;trand covered with an innumerable multitude of &s;hades, who, upon his jumping a&s;hore, immediately vani&s;hed. He then pur&s;ues his cour&s;e to the palace of Pluto, who is de|&s;cribed as &s;eated on his throne in terrible maje&s;ty, with
<PB N="147" REF="150">
Pro&s;erpine by his &s;ide. At the foot of his throne was the pale hideous &s;pectre, who, by the gha&s;tline&s;s of his vi&s;age, and the nature of his apparitions that &s;urrounded him, di&s;covers him&s;elf to be Death. His attendants are Melan|choly, Di&s;tru&s;t, Revenge, Hatred, Avarice, De&s;pair, Am|bition, Envy, Impiety, with frightful Dreams, and waking Cares, which are all drawn very naturally in proper acti|ons and po&s;tures. The author, with great beauty, places near his frightful Dreams an a&s;&s;embly of Phantoms, which are often employed to terrify the living, by appearing in the &s;hape and likene&s;s of the dead.</P>
<P>The young hero, in the next place, takes a &s;urvey of the different kinds of criminals that lay in torture a|mong clouds of &s;ulphur, and torrents of fire. The fir&s;t of the&s;e were &s;uch as had been guilty of impieties, which e|very one hath an horror for: to which is added, a cata|logue of &s;uch offenders that &s;carce appear to be faulty, in the eyes of the vulgar. Among the&s;e, &s;ays the author, are malicious critics, that have endeavoured to ca&s;t a blemi&s;h upon the perfections of others; with whom he likewi&s;e places &s;uch as have often hurt the reputation of the inno|cent, by pa&s;&s;ing a ra&s;h judgment on their actions, without knowing the occa&s;ion of them. The&s;e crimes, &s;ays he, are more &s;everely puni&s;hed after death, becau&s;e they ge|nerally meet with impunity upon earth.</P>
<P>Telemachus, after having taken a &s;urvey of &s;everal o|ther wretches in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, arrives at that region of torments in which wicked kings are puni&s;hed. There are very fine &s;trokes of imagination in the de&s;cri|ption which he gives of this unhappy multitude. He tells us, that on one &s;ide of them there &s;tood a revengful Fury, thundering in their ears ince&s;&s;ant repetitions of all the crimes they had committed upon earth, with the aggra|vations of ambition, vanity, hardne&s;s of heart, and all tho&s;e &s;ecret affections of mind that enter into the compo&s;i|tion of a tyrant. At the &s;ame time, &s;he holds up to them a large mirror, in which every one &s;ees him&s;elf repre&s;ented in the natural horror and deformity of his character.
<PB N="148" REF="151">
On the other &s;ide of them &s;tands another Fury, that, with an in&s;ulting deri&s;ion, repeats to them all the prai&s;es that their flatterers had be&s;towed upon them while they &s;at up|on their re&s;pective thrones. She too, &s;ays the author, pre|&s;ents a mirror before their eyes, in which every one &s;ees him&s;elf adorned with all tho&s;e beauties and perfections in which they had been drawn by the vanity of their own hearts, and the flattery of others. To puni&s;h them for the wantonne&s;s or the cruelty which they formerly exerci&s;|ed, they are now delivered up to be treated according to the fancy and caprice of &s;everal &s;laves, who have here an opportunity of tyrannizing in their turns.</P>
<P>The author having given us a de&s;cription of the&s;e gha&s;tly &s;pectres, who, &s;ays he, are always calling upon Death, and are placed under the di&s;tillation of that burn|ing vengeance which falls upon them drop by drop, and is never to be exhau&s;ted, leads us into a plea&s;ing &s;cene of groves, filled with the melody of birds, and the odours of a thou&s;and different plants. The&s;e groves are repre|&s;ented as ri&s;ing among a great many flowery meadows, and watered with &s;treams that diffu&s;e a perpetual fre&s;h|ne&s;s in the mid&s;t of an eternal day, and a never-fading &s;pring. This, &s;ays the author, was the habitation of tho&s;e good princes who were friends of the gods, and parents of the people. Among the&s;e Telemachus conver&s;es with the &s;hade of one of his ance&s;tors, who makes a mo&s;t a|greeable relation of the joys of Ely&s;ium, and the nature of its inhabitants. The re&s;idence of Se&s;o&s;tris among the&s;e happy &s;hades, with his character and pre&s;ent employment, is drawn in a very lively manner, and with a great ele|vation of thought.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription of that pure and gentle light which overflows the&s;e happy regions, and clothes the &s;pirits of the&s;e virtuous per&s;ons, hath &s;omething in it of that en|thu&s;ia&s;m which this author was accu&s;ed of by his enemies in the church of Rome; but however it may look in re|ligion, it makes a very beautiful figure in poetry.</P>
<P>The rays of the fun, &s;ays he, are darkne&s;s in compari|&s;on
<PB N="149" REF="152">
with this light, which rather de&s;erves the name of glory, than that of light. It pierces the thicke&s;t bodies, in the &s;ame manner as the &s;un-beams pa&s;s through chry|&s;tal; it &s;trengthens the &s;ight in&s;tead of dazling it; and nouri&s;hes in the mo&s;t inward rece&s;&s;es of the mind, a per|petual &s;erenity that is not to be expre&s;&s;ed. It enters and incorporates it&s;elf with the very &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;oul: the &s;pirits of the ble&s;&s;ed feel it in all their &s;en&s;es, and in all their perceptions. It produces a certain &s;ource of peace and joy that ari&s;es in them for ever, running through all the faculties, and refre&s;hing all the de&s;ires of the &s;oul, External plea&s;ures and delights, with all their charms and allurements, are regarded with the utmo&s;t indifference and neglect by the&s;e happy &s;pirits who have this great prin|ciple of plea&s;ure within them, drawing the whole mind to it&s;elf, calling off their attention from the mo&s;t delight|ful objects, and giving them all the tran&s;ports of inebri|ation, without the confu&s;ion and folly of it.</P>
<P>I have here only mentioned &s;ome ma&s;ter-touches of this admirable piece, becau&s;e the original it&s;elf is under|&s;tood by the greater part of my readers. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I take a particular delight in the&s;e pro&s;pects of futurity, whether grounded upon the probable &s;ugge&s;tions of a fine imagination, or the more &s;evere conclu&s;ions of phi|lo&s;ophy; as a man loves to hear all the di&s;coveries or con|jectures relating to a foreign country which he is, at &s;ome time, to inhabit. Pro&s;pects of this nature lighten the bur|den of any pre&s;ent evil; and refre&s;h us under the wor&s;t and lowe&s;t circum&s;tances of mortality. They extingui&s;h in us both the fear and envy of human grandeur. In|&s;olence &s;hrinks its head, power di&s;appears; pain, poverty, and death fly before them. In &s;hort, the mind, that is habitutated to the lively &s;en&s;e of an hereafter, can hope for what is the mo&s;t terrifying to the generality of man|kind, and rejoice in what is the mo&s;t afflicting.</P>

<P>TOM FOLIO is a broker in learning, employed to get together good editions, and &s;tock the libraries of great men. There is not a &s;ale of books begins till Tom Folio is &s;een at the door. There is not an auction where his name is not heard, and that too in the very nick of time, in the critical moment, before the la&s;t de|ci&s;ive &s;troke of the hammer. There is not a &s;ub&s;cription goes forward, in which Tom is not privy to the fir&s;t rough draught of the propo&s;als; nor a catalogue printed, that doth not come to him wet from the pre&s;s. He is an uni|ver&s;al &s;cholar, &s;o far as the title-page of all authors, knows the manu&s;cripts in which they were di&s;covered, the editions through which they have pa&s;&s;ed, with the prai&s;es or cen&s;ures which they have received from the &s;everal members of the learned world. He has a greater e&s;teem for Aldus and Elzevir, than for Virgil and Ho|race. If you talk of Herodotus, he breaks out into a pane|gyric upon Harry Stephens. He thinks he gives you an account of the author, when he tells the &s;ubject he treats of, the name of the editor, and the year in which it was printed. Or if you draw him into further particulars, he cries up the goodne&s;s of the paper, extols the diligence of the corrector, and is tran&s;ported with the beauty of the letter. This he looks upon to be &s;ound learning and &s;ub&s;tantial critici&s;m. As for tho&s;e who talk of the finene&s;s of &s;tile, and the ju&s;tne&s;s of thought, or de&s;cribe the bright|ne&s;s of any particular pa&s;&s;ages; nay, though they write them&s;elves in the genius and &s;pirit of the author they admire, Tom looks upon them as men of &s;uperficial learn|ing, and fla&s;hy parts.</P>
<P>I had ye&s;terday morning a vi&s;it from this learning idi|ot, for that is the light in which I con&s;ider every pedant,
<PB N="151" REF="154">
when I di&s;covered in him &s;ome little touches of the cox|comb, which I had not before ob&s;erved. Being very full of the figure which he makes in the republic of letters, and wonderfully &s;atisfied with his great &s;tock of know|lege, he gave me broad intimations, that he did not believe in all points as his forefathers had done. He then com|municated to me a thought of a certain author upon a pa&s;&s;age of Virgil's account of the dead, which I made the &s;ubject of a late paper. This thought hath taken ve|ry much among men of Tom's pitch and under&s;tanding, though univer&s;ally exploded by all that know how to con|&s;true Virgil, or have any reli&s;h of antiquity. Not to trou|ble my reader with it, I found upon the whole, that Tom did not believe a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, becau&s;e Aeneas, at his living the empire of the dead, pa&s;|&s;ed through the gate of ivory, and not through that of horn. Knowing that Tom had not &s;en&s;e enough to give up an opinion which he had once received, that he might avoid wrangling, I told him, that Virgil po&s;&s;ibly had his over&s;ights as well as another author. Ah! Mr. Bicker|&s;taffe, &s;ays he, you would have another opinion of him, if you would read him in Daniel Hein&s;ius's edition. I have peru&s;ed him my&s;elf &s;everal times in that edition, continued he; and after the &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t malicious examination could find but two faults in him: one of them is in the Aeneid, where there are two commas in|&s;tead of a parenthe&s;is; and another in the third Geor|gic, where you may find a &s;emicolon turned up&s;ide down. Perhaps, &s;aid I, the&s;e were not Virgil's faults but tho&s;e of the tran&s;criber. I do not de&s;ign it, &s;ays Tom as a re|flection on Virgil: on the contrary, I know that all the manu&s;cripts reclaim again&s;t &s;uch a punctuation. Oh! Mr. Bicker&s;taffe, &s;ays he, what would a man give to &s;ee one &s;imile of Virgil writ in his own hand? I a&s;ked him which was the &s;imile he meant; but was an&s;wered, any &s;i|mile in Virgil. He then told me all the &s;ecret hi&s;tory in the common-wealth of learning; of modern pieces that had the names of the ancient authors annexed to them; of all
<PB N="152" REF="155">
the books that were now writing or printing in the &s;e|veral parts of Europe; of many amendments which are made, and not yet publi&s;hed; and a thou&s;and other parti|culars, which I would not have my memory burdened with for a Vatican.</P>
<P>At length, being fully per&s;uaded that I thoroughly ad|mired him, and looked upon him as a prodigy of learn|ing, he took his leave. I know &s;everal of Tom's cla&s;s who are profe&s;&s;ed admirers of Ta&s;&s;o without under&s;tand|ing a word of Italian; and one in particular, that carries a Pa&s;tor-fido in his pocket, in which I am &s;ure he is ac|quainted with no other beauty but the clearne&s;s of the character.</P>
<P>There is another kind of pedant, who, with all Tom Folio's impertinences, hath greater &s;uper&s;tructures and embelli&s;hments of Greek and Latin, and is &s;till more in|&s;upportable than the other, in the &s;ame degree as he is more learned. Of this kind very often are editors, com|mentators, interpreters, &s;cholia&s;ts, and critics; and in &s;hort, all men of deep learning without common &s;en&s;e. The&s;e per&s;ons &s;et a greater value on them&s;elves for having found out the meaning of a pa&s;&s;age in Greek, than upon the author for having written it; nay, will allow the pa&s;|&s;age it&s;elf not to have any beauty in it, at the &s;ame time that they would be con&s;idered as the greate&s;t men of the age for having interpreted it. They will look with con|tempt upon the mo&s;t beautiful poems that have been com|po&s;ed by any of their contemporaries; but will lock them|&s;elves up in their &s;tudies for a twelvemonth together, to correct, publi&s;h, and expound &s;uch trifles of antiquity as a modern author would be contemned for. Men of the &s;tricte&s;t morals, &s;evere&s;t lives, and the grave&s;t profe&s;&s;ions, will write volumes upon an idle &s;onnet that is originally in Greek or Latin; give editions of the mo&s;t immoral au|thors, and &s;pin out whole pages upon the various readings of a lewd expre&s;&s;ion. All that can be &s;aid in excu&s;e for them, is, that their works &s;ufficiently &s;hew they have no ta&s;te of their authors; and that what they do in this kind,
<PB N="153" REF="156">
is out of their great learning, and not out of any levity or la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s of temper.</P>
<P>A pedant of this nature is wonderfully well de&s;cribed in &s;ix lines of Boileau, with which I &s;hall conclude his character.<Q><L>Un pedant enyvre de &s;u vaine &s;cience,</L>

<P>A COMMON civility to an impertinent fellow, often draws upon one a great many unfore&s;een troubles; and if one doth not take particular care, will be interpre|ted by him as an overture of friend&s;hip and intimacy. This I was very &s;en&s;ibly of this morning. About two hours before day, I heard a great rapping at my door, which continued &s;ome time, till my maid could get her|&s;elf ready to go down and &s;ee what was the occa&s;ion of it. She then brought me up word, that there was a gen|tleman who &s;eemed very much in ha&s;te, and &s;aid he mu&s;t needs &s;peak with me. By the de&s;cription &s;he gave me of him, and by his voice, which I could hear as I lay in my bed, I fancied him to be my old acquaintance the Up|hol&s;terer, whom I met the other day in St. James's-Park. For which rea&s;on, I bid her tell the gentleman, whoever he was, that I was indi&s;po&s;ed, that I could &s;ee no body, and that, if he had any thing to &s;ay to me, I de&s;ired he would leave it in writing. My maid, after having delivered her me&s;&s;age, told me, that the gentleman &s;aid he would &s;tay at the next coffee-hou&s;e till I was &s;tirring, and bid her be &s;ure to tell me, that the French were driven from the Scarp, and that Douay was inve&s;ted. He gave her the
<PB N="154" REF="157">
name of another town, which I found &s;he had dropped by the way.</P>
<P>As much as I love to be informed of the &s;ucce&s;s of my brave countrymen, I do not care for hearing of a victory before day, and was therefore very much out of humour as this un&s;ea&s;onable vi&s;it. I had no &s;ooner recovered my temper, and was falling a&s;leep, but I was immediately &s;tartled by a &s;econd rap; and upon my maid's opening the door, heard the &s;ame voice a&s;k her, if her ma&s;ter was yet up? And at the &s;ame time bid her tell me, that he was come on purpo&s;e to talk with me about a piece of home|news that every body in the town will be full of two hours hence. I ordered my maid as &s;oon as &s;he came in|to the room, without hearing her me&s;&s;age, to tell the gen|tleman, that whatever his news was, I would rather hear it two hours hence than now; and that I per&s;i&s;ted in my re&s;olution not to &s;peak with any body that morning. The wench delivered my an&s;wer pre&s;ently, and &s;hut the door. It was impo&s;&s;ible for me to compo&s;e my&s;elf to &s;leep after two &s;uch unexpected alarms; for which rea&s;on I put on my clothes in a very peevi&s;h humour. I took &s;everal turns about my chamber, reflecting with a great deal of anger and contempt on the&s;e volunteers in politics, that un|dergo all the pain, watchfulne&s;s and di&s;quiet of a fir&s;t mini&s;ter, without turning it to the advantage either of them&s;elves or their country; and yet it is &s;urprizing to con&s;ider how numerous this &s;pecies of men is. There is nothing more frequent than to find a taylor breaking his re&s;t on the affairs of Europe, and to &s;ee a clu&s;ter of por|ters &s;itting upon the mini&s;try. Our &s;treets &s;warm with politicians, and there is &s;carce a &s;hop which is not held by a &s;tate&s;man. As I was mu&s;ing after this manner, I heard the Uphol&s;terer at the door, delivering a letter to my maid, and begging her, in a very great hurry, to give it to her ma&s;ter as &s;oon as ever he was awake, which I opened and found as follows:

<P>But this is not my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s. If you remember, I whi&s;pered a word in your ear as we were walking up the Mall, and you &s;ee what has happened &s;ince.

<P>I WAS walking two or three days ago in a very plea&s;ing retirement, and amu&s;ing my&s;elf with the reading of that ancient and beautiful allegory, called The Table of Cebes. I was at la&s;t &s;o tired with my walk, that I &s;at down to re&s;t my&s;elf upon a bench, that &s;tood in the mid&s;t of an agreeable &s;hade. The mu&s;ic of the birds, that filled all the trees about me, lulled me a&s;leep before I was aware of it; which was followed by a dream, that I impute in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the foregoing author, who had made an impre&s;&s;ion upon my imagination, and put me into his own way of thinking.</P>
<P>I fancied my&s;elf among the Alpes, and, as it is natural in a dream, &s;eemed every moment to bound from one &s;ummit to another, till at la&s;t, after having made this airy progre&s;s over the tops of &s;everal mountains, I arrived at the very centre of tho&s;e broken rocks and precipices. I here, methought, &s;aw a prodigious circuit of hills, that
<PB N="157" REF="160">
reached above the clouds, and encompa&s;&s;ed a large &s;pace of ground, which I had a great curio&s;ity to look into. I thereupon continued my former way of travelling through a great variety of winter &s;cenes, till I had gained the top of the&s;e white mountains, which &s;eemed another Alpes of &s;now. I looked down from hence into a &s;pacious plain, which was &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by this mound of hills, and which pre&s;ented me with the mo&s;t agreeable pro&s;pect I had ever &s;een. There was a greater variety of colours in the embroidery of the meadows, a more lively green in the leaves and gra&s;s, a brighter chry&s;tal in the &s;treams, than what I ever met with in any other region. The light it&s;elf had &s;omething more &s;hining and glorious in it than that of which the day is made in other places. I was wonderfully a&s;toni&s;hed at the di&s;covery of &s;uch a pa|radi&s;e amid&s;t the wildne&s;s of tho&s;e cold hoary land&s;kips which lay about it; but found at length, that this happy region was inhabited by the Godde&s;s of Liberty; who&s;e pre&s;ence &s;oftened the rigours of the climate, enriched the barrenne&s;s of the &s;oil, and more than &s;upplied the ab&s;ence of the &s;un. The place was covered with a wonderful pro|fu&s;ion of flowers, that, without being di&s;po&s;ed into regular borders and parterres, grew promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and had a great|er beauty in their natural luxuriancy and di&s;order, than they could have received from the checks and re&s;traints of art. There was a river that aro&s;e out of the &s;outh &s;ide of the mountain, that by an infinite number of turns and windings, &s;eemed to vi&s;it every plant, and cheri&s;h the &s;everal beauties of the &s;pring, with which the fields a|bounded. After having run to and fro in a wonderful variety of Meanders, it at la&s;t throws it&s;elf into the hol|low of a mountain, from whence it pa&s;&s;es under a long range of rocks, and at length ri&s;es into that part of the Alpes where the inhabitants think it the fir&s;t &s;ource of the Rhone. This river, after having made its progre&s;s through tho&s;e free nations, &s;tagnates in a huge lake at the leaving of them, and no &s;ooner enters into the regions of Slavery,
<PB N="158" REF="161">
but runs through them with an incredible rapidity, and takes its &s;horte&s;t way to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>I de&s;cended into the happy fields that lay beneath me, and in the mid&s;t of them, beheld the godde&s;s &s;itting up|on a throne. She had nothing to enclo&s;e her but the bounds of her own dominions, and nothing over her head but the heavens. Every glance of her eye ca&s;t a track of light where it fell, that revived the &s;pring, and made all things &s;mile about her. My heart grew chearful at the &s;ight of her, and as &s;he looked upon me, I found a cer|tain con&s;idence growing in me, and &s;uch an inward re|&s;olution as I never felt before that time.</P>
<P>On the left hand of the godde&s;s &s;at the genius of a com|monwealth, with the cap of liberty on her head, and in her hand a wand, like that with which a Roman citizen u&s;|ed to give his &s;laves their freedom. There was &s;omething mean and vulgar, but at the &s;ame time exceeding bold and daring in her air; her eyes were full of fire, but had in them &s;uch ca&s;ts of &s;iercene&s;s and cruelty, as made her ap|pear to me rather dreadful than amiable. On her &s;houl|ders &s;he wore a mantle, on which there was wrought a great confu&s;ion of figures. As it flew in the wind, I could not di&s;cern the particular de&s;ign of them, but &s;aw wounds in the bodies of &s;ome, and agonies in the faces of others; and over one part of it could read in letters of blood, The Ides of March.</P>
<P>On the right hand of the godde&s;s was the genius of monarchy. She was clothed in the white&s;t ermin, and wore a crown of the pure&s;t gold upon her head. In her hand &s;he held a &s;ceptre like that which is born by the Briti&s;h monarchs. A couple of tame lions lay crouching at her feet: her countenance had in it a very great maje&s;ty without any mixture of terror: her voice was like the voice of an angel, filled with &s;o much &s;weetne&s;s, accom|panied with &s;uch an air of conde&s;cen&s;ion, as tempered the awfulne&s;s of her appearance, and equally in&s;pired love and veneration into the hearts of all that beheld her.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="162">
In the train of the godde&s;s of liberty were the &s;everal Arts and Sciences, who all of them flouri&s;hed underneath her eye. One of them in particular made a greater figure than any of the re&s;t, who held a thunderbolt in her hand, which had the power of melting, piercing, or breaking every thing that &s;tood in its way. The name of this god|de&s;s was Eloquence.</P>
<P>There were two other dependent godde&s;&s;es, who made a very con&s;picuous figure in this bli&s;sful region. The fir&s;t of them was &s;eated upon an hill, that had every plant growing out of it, which the &s;oil was in its own nature capable of producing. The other was &s;eated in a little i&s;land, that was covered with groves of &s;pices, olives, and orange-trees; and in a word, with the products of every foreign clime. The name of the fir&s;t was Plenty, of the &s;econd Commerce. The fir&s;t leaned her right arm upon a plough, and under her left held a huge horn, out of which &s;he poured a whole autumn of fruits. The other wore a ro&s;tral crown upon her head, and kept her eyes fixed upon a compa&s;s.</P>
<P>I was wonderfully plea&s;ed in ranging through this de|lightful place, and the more &s;o, becau&s;e it was not incumbe|red with fences and enclo&s;ures; till at length, methoughts, I &s;prung from the ground, and pitched upon the top of an hill, that pre&s;ented &s;everal objects to my &s;ight which I had not before taken notice of. The winds that pa&s;&s;ed o|ver the flowery plain, and through the tops of trees which were full of blo&s;&s;oms, blew upon me in &s;uch a continued breeze of &s;weets, that I was wonderfully charmed with my &s;ituation. I here &s;aw all the inner declivities of that great circuit of mountains, who&s;e out&s;ide was covered with &s;now, overgrown with huge fore&s;ts of fir-trees, which indeed are very frequently found in other parts of the Alpes. The&s;e trees were inhabited by &s;torks, that came thither in great &s;lights from very di&s;tant quarters of the world. Methought I was plea&s;ed in my dream to &s;ee what became of the&s;e birds, when upon leaving the places to which they make an annual vi&s;it, they ri&s;e in great flocks
<PB N="160" REF="163">
&s;o high till they are out of &s;ight; and for that rea&s;on have been thought by &s;ome modern philo&s;ophers to take a flight to the moon. But my eyes were &s;oon diverted from this pro&s;pect, when I ob&s;erved two great gaps that led through this circuit of mountains, where guards and watches were po&s;ted day and night. Upon examination I found, that there were two formidable enemies encamped before each of the&s;e avenues, who kept the place in a perpetual alarm, and watched all opportunities of inva|ding it.</P>
<P>Tyranny was at the head of one of the&s;e armies, dre&s;|&s;ed in an Ea&s;tern habit, and gra&s;ping in her hand an iron &s;ceptre. Behind her was Barbarity, with the garb and complexion of an Aethiopian; Ignorance with a turbant upon her head; and Per&s;ecution holding up a bloody flag, embroidered with flower-de-luces. The&s;e were followed by Oppre&s;&s;ion, Poverty, Famine, Torture, and a dreadful train of appearances, that made me tremble to behold them. Among the baggage of this army, I could di&s;cover racks, wheels, chains, and gibbets, with all the in&s;tru|ments art could invent to make human nature mi&s;e|rable.</P>
<P>Before the other avenue I &s;aw Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, dre&s;&s;ed in a garment not unlike the Poli&s;h ca&s;&s;ock, and, leading up a whole army of mon&s;ters, &s;uch as Clamour, with a hoar&s;e voice and a hundred tongues; Confu&s;ion, with a mi&s;-&s;hapen body and a thou&s;and heads; Impudence, with a forehead of bra&s;s; and Rapine, with hands of iron. The tumult, noi&s;e, and uproar in this quarter were &s;o very great, that they di&s;turbed my imagination more than is con&s;i&s;tent with &s;leep, and by that means awaked me.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own apartment, <DATE>April 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN my younger years I u&s;ed many endeavours to get a place at court, and indeed continued my pur&s;uits till I arrived at my Grand Climacteric: but at length altoge|ther de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s, whether it were for want of capacity, friends, or due application, I at la&s;t re&s;olved to erect a new office, and for my encouragement, to place my&s;elf in it. For this rea&s;on, I took upon me the title and dignity of Cen&s;or of Great Britain, re&s;erving to my|&s;elf all &s;uch perqui&s;ites, profits, and emoluments as &s;hould ari&s;e out of the di&s;charge of the &s;aid office. The&s;e in truth have not been incon&s;iderable; for be&s;ides tho&s;e weekly contributions which I receive from John Mor|phew, and tho&s;e annual &s;ub&s;criptions which I propo&s;e to my&s;elf from the mo&s;t elegant part of this great i&s;land, I daily live in a very comfortable affluence of wine, &s;tale beer, Hungary water, beef, books, and marrow-bones, which I receive from many well-di&s;po&s;ed citizens; not to mention the forfeitures which accrue to me from the &s;everal offenders that appear before me on court-days.</P>
<P>Having now enjoyed this office for the &s;pace of a twelvemonth, I &s;hall do, what all good officers ought to do, take a &s;urvey of my behaviour, and con&s;ider carefully whether I have di&s;charged my duty, and acted up to the character with which I am inve&s;ted. For my direction in this particular, I have made a narrow &s;earch into the na|ture of the old Roman Cen&s;ors, whom I mu&s;t always re|gard, not only as my predece&s;&s;ors, but as my patterns in this great employment; and have &s;everal times a&s;ked my own heart, with great impartiality, whether Cato will not bear a more venerable figure among po&s;terity than Bicker&s;ta&s;&s;e?</P>
<P>I find the duty of the Roman Cen&s;or was twofold.
<PB N="162" REF="165">
The fir&s;t part of it con&s;i&s;ted in making frequent reviews of the people, in ca&s;ting up their numbers, ranging them un|der their &s;everal tribes, di&s;po&s;ing them into proper cla&s;|&s;es, and &s;ubdividing them into their re&s;pective centuries.</P>
<P>In compliance with this part of the office, I have taken many curious &s;urveys of this great city. I have collected into particular bodies the Dappers and the Smarts, the Natural and Affected Rakes, the Pretty fel|lows and the Very pretty fellows. I have likewi&s;e drawn out in &s;everal di&s;tinct parties your Pedants and Men of fire, your Game&s;ters and Politicians. I have &s;eparated Cits from Citizens, Free-thinkers from Philo&s;ophers, Wits from Snuff-takers, and Duelli&s;ts from Men of honour. I have likewi&s;e made a calculation of E&s;quires, not only con&s;idering the &s;everal di&s;tinct &s;warms of them that are &s;ettled in the different parts of this town, but al&s;o that more rugged &s;pecies that inhabit the fields and woods, and are often found in pot-hou&s;es and upon hay-cocks.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s the &s;oft &s;ex over in &s;ilence, having not yet reduced them into tolerable order; as likewi&s;e the &s;ofter tribe of lovers, which will co&s;t me a great deal of time, before I &s;hall be able to ca&s;t them into their &s;everal cen|turies and &s;ub-divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The &s;econd part of the Roman Cen&s;or's office was to look into the manners of the people, and to check any growing luxury, whether in diet, dre&s;s, or building. This duty likewi&s;e I have endeavoured to di&s;charge, by tho&s;e whol&s;ome precepts which I have given my country-men in regard to beef and mutton, and the &s;evere cen&s;ures which I have pa&s;&s;ed upon ragouts and fricacies. There is not, as I am informed, a pair of red heels to be &s;een within ten miles of London, which I may likewi&s;e a&s;cribe, without vanity, to the becoming zeal which I expre&s;&s;ed in that particular. I mu&s;t own, my &s;ucce&s;s with the pet|ticoat is not &s;o great; but as I have not yet done with it, I hope I &s;hall in a little time put an effectual &s;top to that growing evil. As for the article of building, I intend hereafter to enlarge upon it, having lately ob&s;erved &s;eve|ral
<PB N="163" REF="166">
warehou&s;es, nay, private &s;hops, that &s;tand upon Co|rinthian pillars, and whole rows of tin pots &s;hewing them|&s;elves, in order to their &s;ale, through a &s;a&s;h-window.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e followed the example of the Roman Cen&s;ors, in puni&s;hing offences according to the quality of the offender. It was u&s;ual for them to expel a &s;enator who had been guilty of great immoralities out of the &s;e|nate-hou&s;e, by omitting his name when they called over the li&s;t of his brethren. In the &s;ame manner, to remove effectually &s;everal worthle&s;s men who &s;tand po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great honours, I have made frequent draughts of dead men out of the vicious part of the nobility, and given them up to the new &s;ociety of upholders, with the ne|ce&s;&s;ary orders for their interment. As the Roman Cen&s;ors u&s;ed to puni&s;h the knights or gentlemen of Rome, by taking away their hor&s;es from them, I have &s;eized the canes of many criminals of figure, whom I had ju&s;t rea|&s;on to animadvert upon. As for the offenders among the common people of Rome, they were generally cha&s;ti&s;ed, by being thrown out of a higher tribe, and placed in one which was not &s;o honourable. My reader cannot but think I have had an eye to this puni&s;hment, when I have degraded one &s;pecies of men into bombs, &s;quibs, and crackers, and another into drums, ba&s;s-viols, and bag|pipes; not to mention whole packs of delinquents whom I have &s;hut up in kennels, and the new ho&s;pital which I am at pre&s;ent erecting, for the reception of tho&s;e of my country-men who give me but little hopes of their a|mendment, on the borders of Moor-fields. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve upon this particular, that &s;ince &s;ome late &s;urveys I have taken of this i&s;land, I &s;hall think it nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge the plan of the buildings which I de&s;ign in this quarter.</P>
<P>When my great predece&s;&s;or Cato the elder &s;tood for the cen&s;or&s;hip of Rome, there were &s;everal other compe|titors who offered them&s;elves; and to get an intere&s;t a|mong the people, gave them great promi&s;es of the mild and gentle treatment which they would u&s;e towards them
<PB N="164" REF="167">
in that office. Cato on the contrary told them, he pre|&s;ented him&s;elf as a candidate, becau&s;e he knew the age was &s;unk in immorality and corruption; and that if they would give him their votes he would promi&s;e them to make u&s;e of &s;uch a &s;trictne&s;s and &s;everity of di&s;cipline as &s;hould re|cover them out of it. The Roman hi&s;torians, upon this occa&s;ion, very much celebrated the public-&s;piritedne&s;s of that people, who cho&s;e Cato for their Cen&s;or, not|with&s;tanding his method of recommending him&s;elf. I may in &s;ome mea&s;ure extol my own country-men upon the &s;ame account, who, without any re&s;pect to party, or any application from my&s;elf, have made &s;uch generous &s;ub&s;criptions for the Cen&s;or of Great Britain, as will give a magnificence to my old-age, and which I e&s;teem more than I would any po&s;t in Europe of an hundred times the value. I &s;hall only add, that upon looking into my ca|talogue of &s;ub&s;cribers, which I intend to print alphabeti|cally in the front of my lucubrations, I find the names of the greate&s;t beauties and wits in the whole i&s;land of Great Britain, which I only mention for the benefit of any of them who have not yet &s;ub&s;cribed; it being my de&s;ign to clo&s;e the &s;ub&s;cription in a very &s;hort time.</P>

<P>I YESTERDAY came hither about two hours before the company generally make their appearance, with a de|&s;ign to read over all the news-papers; but upon my &s;it|ting
<PB N="165" REF="168">
down, I was acco&s;ted by Ned Softly, who &s;aw me from a corner in the other end of the room, where I found he had been writing &s;omething. Mr. Bicker&s;taffe, &s;ays he, I ob&s;erve by a late paper of yours, that you and I are ju&s;t of a humour; for you mu&s;t know, of all imper|tinencies there is nothing which I &s;o much hate as news. I never read a Gazette in my life; and never troubled my head about our armies, whether they win or lo&s;e, or in which part of the world they ly encamped. Without giving me time to reply, he drew a paper of ver&s;es out of his pocket, telling me, that he had &s;omething which would entertain me more agreeably, and that he would de&s;ire my judgment upon every line, for that we had time enough before us till the company came in.</P>
<P>Ned Softly is a very pretty poet, and a great admirer of ea&s;y lines. Waller is his favourite: and as that admi|rable writer has the be&s;t and wor&s;t ver&s;es of any among our Engli&s;h poets, Ned Softly has got all the bad ones without book, which he repeats upon occa&s;ion, to &s;hew his reading, and garni&s;h his conver&s;ation. Ned is indeed a true Engli&s;h reader, incapable of reli&s;hing the great and ma&s;terly &s;trokes of this art; but wonderfully plea&s;ed with the little Gothic ornaments of epigrammatical conceits, turns, points, and quibbles, which are &s;o frequent in the mo&s;t admired of our Engli&s;h poets, and practi&s;ed by tho&s;e who want genius and &s;trength to repre&s;ent, after the manner of the ancients, &s;implicity in its natural beauty and perfection.</P>
<P>Finding my&s;elf unavoidably engaged in &s;uch a con|ver&s;ation, I was re&s;olved to turn my pain into a plea&s;ure, and to divert my&s;elf as well as I could with &s;o very odd a fellow. You mu&s;t under&s;tand, &s;ays Ned, that the &s;on|net I am going to read to you was written upon a lady, who &s;hewed me &s;ome ver&s;es of her own making, and is perhaps the be&s;t poet of our age. But you &s;hall hear it, Upon which he begun to read as follows:<Q><PB N="166" REF="169">
To Mira on her incomparable poems.<LG>
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<L>When dre&s;s'd in laurel wreaths you &s;hine,</L>
<L>And tune your &s;oft melodious notes,</L>
<L>You &s;eem a &s;i&s;ter of the nine,</L>
<L>Or Phoebus' &s;elf in petticoats.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>I fancy, when your &s;ong you &s;ing,</L>
<L>(Your &s;ong you &s;ing with &s;o much art)</L>
<L>Your pen was pluck'd from Cupid's wing;</L>
<L>For ah! it wounds me like his dart.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Why, &s;ays I, this is a little no&s;egay of conceits, a very Jump of &s;alt: every ver&s;e hath &s;omething in it that piques; and then the dart in the la&s;t line is certainly as pretty a &s;ting in the tail of an epigram, for &s;o I think your cri|tics call it, as ever entered into the thought of a poet. Dear Mr. Bicker&s;taffe, &s;ays he, &s;haking me by the hand, every body knows you to be a judge of the&s;e things; and to tell you truly, I read over Ro&s;common's tran&s;lation of Horace's Art of Poetry three &s;everal times, before I &s;ate down to write the &s;onnet which I have &s;hewn you. But you &s;hall hear it again, and pray ob&s;erve every line of it, for not one of them &s;hall pa&s;s without your appro|bation.<Q><L>When dre&s;s'd in laurel wreaths you &s;hine.</L></Q></P>
<P>That is, &s;ays he, when you have your garland on; when you are writing ver&s;es. To which I replied, I know your meaning: a metaphor! The &s;ame, &s;aid he, and went on:<Q><PB N="167" REF="170">
<L>And tune your &s;oft melodious notes.</L></Q></P>
<P>Pray ob&s;erve the gliding of that ver&s;e; there is &s;carce a con&s;onant in it: I took care to make it run upon li|quids. Give me your opinion of it. Truly, &s;aid I, I think it as good as the former. I am very glad to hear you &s;ay &s;o, &s;ays he; but mind the next:<Q><L>You &s;eem a &s;i&s;ter of the nine.</L></Q></P>
<P>That is, &s;ays he, you &s;eem a &s;i&s;ter of the mu&s;es; for if you look into ancient authors, you will find it was their opinion, that there were nine of them. I remember it very well, &s;aid I; but pray proceed.<Q><L>Or Phoebus' &s;elf in petticoats.</L></Q></P>
<P>Phoebus, &s;ays he, was the god of poetry. The&s;e little in&s;tances, Mr. Bicker&s;taffe, &s;hew a gentleman's reading. Then to take off from the air of learning, which Phoebus and the mu&s;es have given to this fir&s;t &s;tanza, you may ob|&s;erve, how it falls all of a &s;udden into the familiar; <HI>in petticoats.</HI><Q><L>Or Phoebus' &s;elf in petticoats.</L></Q></P>
<P>Let us now, &s;ays I, enter upon the &s;econd &s;tanza. I find the fir&s;t line is &s;till a continuation of the metaphor.<Q><L>I fancy when your &s;ong you &s;ing.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is very right, &s;ays he; but pray ob&s;erve the turn of words in the&s;e two lines. I was a whole hour in adju&s;ting of them, and have &s;till a doubt upon me, whether in the &s;econd line it &s;hould be, <HI>Your &s;ong you &s;ing;</HI> or, <HI>you &s;ing your &s;ong.</HI> You &s;hall hear them both:<Q><PB N="168" REF="171">
<L>I fancy, when your &s;ong you &s;ing</L>
<L>(Your &s;ong you &s;ing with &s;o much art.)</L></Q> OR,
<Q><L>I fancy, when your &s;ong you &s;ing,</L>
<L>(You &s;ing your &s;ong with &s;o much art.)</L></Q></P>
<P>Truly, &s;aid I, the turn is &s;o natural either way, that you have made me almo&s;t giddy with it. Dear Sir, &s;aid he, gra&s;ping me by the hand, you have a great deal of patience; but what do you think of the next ver&s;e?<Q><L>Your pen was pluck'd from Cupid's wing.</L></Q> Think! &s;ays I; I think you have made Cupid look like a little goo&s;e. That was my meaning, &s;ays he; I think the ridicule is well enough hit off. But we now come to the la&s;t, which &s;ums up the whole matter.<Q><L>For ah! it wounds me like his dart.</L></Q></P>
<P>Pray how do you like that Ah! Doth it not make a pretty figure in that place? Ah! It looks as if I felt the dart, and cried out as being pricked with it.<Q><L>For ah! it wounds me like his dart.</L></Q></P>
<P>My friend Dick Ea&s;y, continued he, a&s;&s;ured me, he would rather have written that Ah! than to have been the author of the Aeneid. He indeed objected, that I made Mira's pen like a quill in one of the lines, and like a dart in the other. But as to that&mdash;Oh! as to that, &s;ays I, it is but &s;uppo&s;ing Cupid to be like a porcupine, and his quills and darts will be the &s;ame thing. He was going to embrace me for the hint; but half a dozen cri|tics coming into the room, who&s;e faces he did not like,
<PB N="169" REF="172">
he conveyed the &s;onnet into his pocket, and whi&s;pered me in the ear, he would &s;how it me again as &s;oon as his man had written it over fair.</P>

<P>IT has always been my endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h between realities and appearances, and to &s;eparate true merit from the pretence to it. As it ever &s;hall be my &s;tudy to make di&s;coveries of this nature in human life, and to &s;et|tle the proper di&s;tinctions between the virtues and per|fections of mankind, and tho&s;e fal&s;e colours and re&s;em|blances of them that &s;hine alike in the eyes of the vulgar; &s;o I &s;hall be more particularly careful to &s;earch into the various merits and pretences of the learned world. This is the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e there &s;eems to be a general combination among the pedants to extol one another's la|bours, and cry up one another's parts; while men of &s;en&s;e, either through that mode&s;ty which is natural to them, or the &s;corn they have for &s;uch trifling commendations, enjoy their &s;tock of knowlege like a hidden trea&s;ure with &s;atisfaction and &s;ilence. Pedantry indeed in learning is like hypocri&s;y in religion, a form of knowlege with|out the power of it, that attracts the eyes of the common people, breaks out in noi&s;e and &s;how, and finds its re|ward not from any inward plea&s;ure that attends it, but from the prai&s;es and approbations which it receives from men.</P>
<P>Of this &s;hallow &s;pecies there is not a more importunate, empty, and conceited animal, than that which is general|ly known by the name of a critic. This, in the com|mon acceptation of the word, is one that, without enter|ing into the &s;en&s;e and &s;oul of an author, has a few gene|ral rules, which, like mechanical in&s;truments, he applies to the works of every writer, and as they quadrate with them, pronounces the author perfect or defective. He is ma&s;ter of a certain &s;et of words, as unity, &s;tile, fire,
<PB N="170" REF="173">
flegm, ea&s;y, natural, turn, &s;entiment, and the like; which he varies, compounds, divides, and throws together, in every part of his di&s;cour&s;e, without any thought or mean|ing. The marks you may know him by are, an elevat|ed eye, and dogmatical brow, a po&s;itive voice, and a con|tempt for every thing that comes out, whether he has read it or not. He dwells altogether in generals. He prai&s;es or di&s;prai&s;es in the lump. He &s;hakes his head very frequently at the pedantry of univer&s;ities, and bur&s;ts into laughter when you mention an author that is known at Will's. He hath formed his judgment upon Homer, Ho|race, and Virgil, not from their own works, but from tho&s;e of Rapin and Bo&s;&s;u. He knows his own &s;trength &s;o well, that he never dares prai&s;e any thing in which he has not a French author for his voucher.</P>
<P>With the&s;e extraordinary talents and accompli&s;hments, Sir Timothy Tittle puts men in vogue, or condemns them to ob&s;curity, and &s;its as judge of life and death upon e|very author that appears in public. It is impo&s;&s;ible to re|pre&s;ent the pangs, agonies, and convul&s;ions, which Sir Timothy expre&s;&s;es in every feature of his face and mu&s;|cle of his body, upon the reading of a bad poet.</P>
<P>About a week ago I was engaged at a friend's hou&s;e of mine in an agreeable conver&s;ation with his wife and daughters, when in the height of our mirth, Sir Timothy, who makes love to my friend's elde&s;t daughter, came in among&s;t us puffing and blowing, as if he had been very much out of breath. He immediately called for a chair, and de&s;ired leave to &s;it down, without any further cere|mony. I a&s;ked him, where he had been? Whether he was out of order? He only replied, that he was quite &s;pent, and fell a cur&s;ing in &s;oliloquy. I could hear him cry, <HI>A wicked rogue&mdash;An execrable wretch&mdash;was there ever &s;uch a mon&s;ter</HI>&mdash;The young ladies upon this began to be affrighted, and a&s;ked, whether any one had hurt him? He an&s;wered nothing, but &s;till talked to him&s;elf. <HI>To lay the fir&s;t &s;cene,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>in St. James's Park, and the la&s;t in Northampton&s;hire!</HI> Is that all? &s;ays I: then I &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="171" REF="174">
you have been at the rehear&s;al of a play this morn|ing. Been! &s;ays he; I have been at Northampton, in the Park, in a lady's bed-chamber, in a dining-room, every where; the rogue has led me &s;uch a dance&mdash;Though I could &s;carce forbear laughing at his di&s;cour&s;e, I told him I was glad it was no wor&s;e, and that he was on|ly metaphorically weary. In &s;hort, Sir, &s;ays he, the au|thor has not ob&s;erved a &s;ingle unity in his whole play; the &s;cene &s;hifts in every dialogue: the villain has hurried me up and down at &s;uch a rate, that I am tired off my legs. I could not but ob&s;erve with &s;ome plea&s;ure, that the young lady whom he made love to, conceived a very ju&s;t aver&s;i|on towards him, upon &s;eeing him &s;o very pa&s;&s;ionate in trifles. And as &s;he had that natural &s;en&s;e which makes her a better judge than a thou&s;and critics, &s;he began to rally him upon this fooli&s;h humour. For my part, &s;ays &s;he, I never knew a play take that was written up to your rules, as you call them. How, madam! &s;ays he, is that your opinion? I am &s;ure you have a better ta&s;te. It is a pretty kind of magic, &s;ays &s;he, the poets have to tran&s;port an audience from place to place without the help of a coach and hor&s;es. I could travel round the world at &s;uch a rate. It is &s;uch an entertainment as an enchantre&s;s finds, when &s;he fancies her&s;elf in a wood, or upon a mountain, at a fea&s;t, or a &s;olemnity; though at the &s;ame time &s;he has never &s;tirred out of her cottage. Your &s;imile, madam, &s;ays Sir Timothy, is by no means ju&s;t. Pray, &s;ays &s;he, let my &s;imiles pa&s;s without a critici&s;m. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, continued &s;he, for I found &s;he was re|&s;olved to exa&s;perate him, I laughed very heartily at the la&s;t new comedy which you found &s;o much fault with. But madam, &s;ays he, you ought not to have laughed; and I defy any one to &s;how me a &s;ingle rule that you could laugh by. Ought not to laugh! &s;ays &s;he, pray who &s;hould hinder me? Madam, &s;ays he, there are &s;uch people in the world as Rapin, Dacier, and &s;everal others, that ought to have &s;poiled your mirth. I have heard, &s;ays the young lady, that your great critics are always very bad poets: I
<PB N="172" REF="175">
fancy there is as much difference between the works of one and the other, as there is between the carriage of a dancing-ma&s;ter and a gentleman. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, continu|ed &s;he, I would not be troubled with &s;o fine a judgment as yours is; for I find you feel more vexation in a bad come|dy, than I do in a deep tragedy. Madam, &s;ays Sir Timothy, that is not my fault, they &s;hould learn the art of writing. For my part, &s;ays the young lady, I &s;hould think the greate&s;t art in your writers of comedies is to plea&s;e. To plea&s;e! &s;ays Sir Timothy; and immediately fell a laugh|ing. Truly, &s;ays &s;he, that is my opinion. Upon this, he compo&s;ed his countenance, looked upon his watch, and took his leave.</P>
<P>I hear that Sir Timothy has not been at my friend's hou&s;e &s;ince this notable conference, to the &s;atisfaction of the young lady, who by this means has got rid of a very impertinent fop.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I could not but ob&s;erve, with a great deal of &s;urprize, how this gentleman by his ill-nature, folly and affectation, hath made him&s;elf capable of &s;uf|fering &s;o many imaginary pains, and looking with &s;uch a &s;en&s;ele&s;s &s;everity upon the common diver&s;ions of life.</P>

<P>SOME years &s;ince I was engaged with a coach full of friends to take a journey as far as the Land's-end. We were very well plea&s;ed with one another the fir&s;t day, every one endeavouring to recommend him&s;elf by his good-humour and complai&s;ance to the re&s;t of the company. This good corre&s;pondence did not la&s;t long; one of our party was &s;owred the very fir&s;t evening by a plate of butter which had not been melted to his mind, and which &s;poiled his temper to &s;uch a degree, that he con|tinued upon the fret to the end of our journey. A &s;econd fell off from his good-humour the next morning, for no
<PB N="173" REF="176">
other rea&s;on I could imagine, but becau&s;e I chanced to &s;tep into the coach before him, and place my&s;elf on the &s;hady &s;ide. This however was but my own private gue&s;s, for he did not mention a word of it, nor indeed of any thing el&s;e, for three days following. The re&s;t of our com|pany held out very near half the way, when of a &s;ud|den Mr. Sprightly fell a&s;leep; and in&s;tead of endeavour|ing to divert and oblige us, as he had hitherto done, car|ried him&s;elf with an unconcerned, carele&s;s drowzy beha|viour, till we came to our la&s;t &s;tage. There were three of us who &s;till held up our heads, and did all we could to make our journey agreeable; but, to my &s;hame be it &s;po|ken, about three miles on this &s;ide Exeter I was taken with an unaccountable fit of &s;ullenne&s;s, that hung upon me for above three&s;core miles; whether it were for want of re&s;pect, or from an accidental tread upon my foot, or from a fooli&s;h maid's calling me The old Gentleman, I cannot tell. In &s;hort, there was but one who kept his good-humour to the Land's-end.</P>
<P>There was another coach that went along with us, in which I likewi&s;e ob&s;erved, that there were many &s;ecret jealou&s;ies, heart-burnings, and animo&s;ities: for when we joined companies at night, I could not but take notice, that the pa&s;&s;engers neglected their own company, and &s;tudied how to make them&s;elves e&s;teemed by us, who were altogether &s;trangers to them; till at length they grew &s;o well acquainted with us, that they liked us as lit|tle as they did one another. When I reflect upon this journey, I often fancy it to be a picture of human life, in re&s;pect to the &s;everal friend&s;hips, contracts, and allian|ces, that are made and di&s;&s;olved in the &s;everal periods of it. The mo&s;t delightful and mo&s;t la&s;ting engagements are generally tho&s;e which pa&s;s between man and woman; and yet upon what trifles are they weakened, or entirely bro|ken? Sometimes the parties &s;ly a&s;under even in the mid&s;t of court&s;hip, and &s;ometimes grow cool in the very honey|month. Some &s;eparate before the fir&s;t child, and &s;ome after the fifth; others continue good till thirty, others
<PB N="174" REF="177">
till forty; while &s;ome few, who&s;e &s;ouls are of an happier make, and better fitted to one another, travel on toge|ther to the end of their journey, in a continual inter|cour&s;e of kind offices and mutual endearments.</P>
<P>When we therefore chu&s;e our companions for life, if we hope to keep both them and our&s;elves in good hu|mour to the la&s;t &s;tage of it, we mu&s;t be extremely care|ful in the choice we make, as well as in the conduct on our own part. When the per&s;ons to whom we join our|&s;elves can &s;tand an examination, and bear the &s;crutiny, when they mend upon our acquaintance with them, and di&s;cover new beauties the more we &s;earch into their cha|racters, our love will naturally ri&s;e in proportion to their perfections.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e there are very few po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch acom|pli&s;hments of body and mind, we ought to look after tho&s;e qualifications both in our&s;elves and others, which are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary towards this happy union, and which are in the power of every one to acquire, or at lea&s;t to cultivate and improve. The&s;e, in my opinion, are chearfulne&s;s and con&s;tancy. A chearful temper, joined with innocence, will make beauty attractive, knowlege delightful, and with good-natured. It will lighten &s;ickne&s;s, poverty, and affliction; convert ignorance into an ami|able &s;implicity, and render deformity it&s;elf agreeable.</P>
<P>Con&s;tancy is natural to per&s;ons of even tempers and uniform di&s;po&s;itions, and may be acquired by tho&s;e of the greate&s;t ficklene&s;s, violence and pa&s;&s;ion, who con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly the terms of union upon which they come toge|ther, the mutual intere&s;t in which they are engaged, with all the motives that ought to incite their tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion towards tho&s;e who have their dependance up|on them, and are embarked with them for life in the &s;ame &s;tate of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. Con&s;tancy, when it grows in the mind upon con&s;iderations of this nature, becomes a moral virtue, and a kind of good-nature, that is not &s;ubject to any change of health, age, fortune, or any of tho&s;e accidents which are apt to un&s;ettle the be&s;t di&s;po&s;i|tions
<PB N="175" REF="178">
that are founded rather in con&s;titution than in rea|&s;on. Where &s;uch a con&s;tancy as this is wanting, the mo&s;t inflamed pa&s;&s;ion may fall away into coldne&s;s and in|difference, and the mo&s;t melting tenderne&s;s degenerate in|to hatred and aver&s;ion. I &s;hall conclude this paper with a &s;tory that is very well known in the north of England.</P>
<P>About thirty years ago, a packet-boat that had &s;everal pa&s;&s;engers on board was ca&s;t away upon a rock, and in &s;o great danger of &s;inking, that all who were in it endea|voured to &s;ave them&s;elves as well as they could, though only tho&s;e who could &s;wim well had a bare po&s;&s;ibility of doing it. Among the pa&s;&s;engers there were two women of fa&s;hion, who, &s;eeing them&s;elves in &s;uch a di&s;con&s;olate condition, begged of their hu&s;bands not to leave them. One of them cho&s;e rather to die with his wife, than to for&s;ake her; the other, though he was moved with the utmo&s;t compa&s;&s;ion for his wife, told her, that for the good of their children, it was better one of them &s;hould live, than both peri&s;h. By a great piece of good luck, next to a miracle, when one of our good men had taken the la&s;t and long farewel in order to &s;ave him&s;elf, and the other held in his arms the per&s;on that was dearer to him than life, the &s;hip was pre&s;erved. It is with a &s;ecret &s;orrow and vexation of mind that I mu&s;t tell the &s;equel of the &s;tory, and let my reader know, that this faithful pair who were ready to have died in each other's arms, about three years after their e&s;cape, upon &s;ome trifling di&s;gu&s;t, grew to a coldne&s;s at fir&s;t, and at length fell out to &s;uch a degree, that they left one another, and parted for ever. The other couple lived together in an uninterrupted friend|&s;hip and felicity; and what was remarkable, the hu&s;band, whom the &s;hipwreck had like to have &s;eparated from his wife, died a few months after her, not being able to &s;ur|vive the lo&s;s of her.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, there is &s;omething in the changeable|ne&s;s and incon&s;tancy of human nature, that very often both dejects and terrifies me. Whatever I am at pre&s;ent, I tremble to think what I may be. While I find this prin|ciple
<PB N="176" REF="179">
in me, how can I a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf, that I &s;hall be al|ways true to my God, my friend, or my&s;elf? in &s;hort, without con&s;tancy there is neither love, friend&s;hip, or virtue in the world.</P>

<P>NATURE is full of wonders; every atom is a &s;tand|ing miracle, and endowed with &s;uch qualities, as could not be impre&s;&s;ed on it by a power and wi&s;dom le&s;s than infinite. For this rea&s;on, I would not di&s;courage any &s;earches that are made into the mo&s;t minute and trivial parts of the creation. However, &s;ince the world a|bounds in the noble&s;t fields of &s;peculation, it is, methinks, the mark of a little genius to be wholly conver&s;ant a|mong in&s;ects, reptiles, animalcules, and tho&s;e trifling ra|rities that furni&s;h out the apartment of a virtuo&s;o.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome men who&s;e heads are &s;o odly turned this way, that though they are utter &s;trangers to the com|mon occurrences of life, they are able to di&s;cover the &s;ex of a cockle, or de&s;cribe the generation of a mite, in all its circum&s;tances. They are &s;o little ver&s;ed in the world, that they &s;carce know a hor&s;e from an ox; but at the &s;ame time will tell you, with a great deal of gravity, that a flea is a rhinoceros, and a &s;nail an hermaphrodite. I have known one of the&s;e whim&s;ical philo&s;ophers who has &s;et a greater value upon a collection of &s;piders than he would upon a flock of &s;heep, and had &s;old his coat off his back to purcha&s;e a tarantula.</P>
<P>I would not have a &s;cholar wholly unacquainted with the&s;e &s;ecrets and curio&s;ities of nature; but certainly the mind of man, that is capable of &s;o much higher contem|plations, &s;hould not be altogether fixed upon &s;uch mean and di&s;proportioned objects. Ob&s;ervations of this kind are apt to alienate us too much from the knowlege of
<PB N="177" REF="180">
the world, and to make us &s;erious upon trifles, by which means they expo&s;e philo&s;ophy to the ridicule of the witty, and the contempt of the ignorant. In &s;hort, &s;tudies of this nature &s;hould be the diver&s;ions, relaxations and a|mu&s;ements, not the care, bu&s;ine&s;s, and concern of life.</P>
<P>It is indeed wonderful to con&s;ider, that there &s;hould be a &s;ort of learned men who are wholly employed in ga|thering together the refu&s;e of nature, if I may call it &s;o, and hoarding up in their che&s;ts and cabinets &s;uch crea|tures as others indu&s;triou&s;ly avoid the &s;ight of. One does not know how to mention &s;ome of the mo&s;t precious parts of their trea&s;ure, without a kind of an apology for it. I have been &s;hewn a beetle valued at twenty crowns, and a toad at an hundred: but we mu&s;t take this for a general rule, that whatever appears trivial or ob&s;cene in the com|mon notions of the world, looks grave and philo&s;ophical in the eye of a virtuo&s;o.</P>
<P>To &s;hew this humour in its perfection, I &s;hall pre&s;ent my reader with the legacy of a certain virtuo&s;o, who laid out a con&s;iderable e&s;tate in natural rarities and curio&s;ities, which upon his death-bed he bequeathed to his relations and friends in the following words:

<P>I CHANCED to ri&s;e very early one particular morning this &s;ummer, and took a walk into the country to di|vert my&s;elf among the fields and meadows, while the green was new, and the flowers in their bloom. As at this &s;ea&s;on of the year every lane is a beautiful walk, and every hedge full of no&s;egays, I lo&s;t my&s;elf with a great deal of plea&s;ure among &s;everal thickets and bu&s;hes that were filled with a great variety of birds, and an agreeable confu&s;ion of notes, which formed the plea&s;ante&s;t &s;cene in the world to one who had pa&s;&s;ed a whole winter in noi&s;e and &s;moke. The fre&s;hne&s;s of the dews that lay up|on every thing about me, with the cool breath of the morning, which in&s;pired the birds with &s;o many delight|ful in&s;tincts, created in me the &s;ame kind of animal plea|&s;ure,
<PB N="180" REF="183">
and made my heart overflow with &s;uch &s;ecret emo|tions of joy and &s;atisfaction as are not to be de&s;cribed or accounted for. On this occa&s;ion, I could not but re|flect upon a beautiful &s;imile in Milton:<Q><L>As one who long in populous city pent,</L>
<L>Where hou&s;es thick, and &s;ewers, annoy the air,</L>
<L>Forth i&s;&s;uing on a &s;ummer's morn, to breathe</L>
<L>Among the plea&s;ant villages, and farms</L>
<L>Adjoin'd, from each thing met conceives delight:</L>
<L>The &s;mell of grain, or tedded gra&s;s, or kine,</L>
<L>Or dairy, each rural &s;ight, each rural &s;ound.</L></Q></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant in the writings of polite authors, receive an additional entertainment from the country, as it revives in their memories tho&s;e charming de&s;criptions with which &s;uch authors do frequently a|bound.</P>
<P>I was thinking of the foregoing beautiful &s;imile in Milton, and applying it to my&s;elf, when I ob&s;erved to the windward of me a black cloud falling to the earth in long trails of rain, which made me betake my&s;elf for &s;helter to a hou&s;e which I &s;aw at a little di&s;tance from the place where I was walking. As I &s;at in the porch, I heard the voices of two or three per&s;ons, who &s;eemed very ear|ne&s;t in di&s;cour&s;e. My curio&s;ity was rai&s;ed when I heard the names of Alexander the Great and Artaxerxes; and as their talk &s;eemed to run on ancient heroes, I concluded there could not be any &s;ecret in it; for which rea&s;on I thought I might very fairly li&s;ten to what they &s;aid.</P>
<P>After &s;everal parallels between great men, which ap|peared to me altogether groundle&s;s and chimerical, I was &s;urprized to hear one &s;ay, that he valued the Black Prince more than the duke of Vendo&s;me. How the duke of Ven|do&s;me &s;hould become a rival of the Black Prince's, I could not conceive: and was more &s;tartled when I heard a &s;econd affirm with great vehemence, that if the emperor of Germany was not going off, he &s;hould like him better
<PB N="181" REF="184">
than either of them. He added, That though the &s;ea&s;on was &s;o changeable, the duke of Marlborough was in blom|ing beauty. I was wondering to my&s;elf from whence they had received this odd intelligence, e&s;pecially when I heard them mention the names of &s;everal other great generals, as the prince of He&s;&s;e, and the king of Sweden, who, they &s;aid, were both running away. To which they added, what I entirely agreed with them in, that the crown of France was very weak, but that the mare&s;chal Villars &s;till kept his colours. At la&s;t one of them told the company, if they would go along with him, he would &s;hew them a chimney-&s;weeper and a painted lady in the &s;ame bed, which he was &s;ure would very much plea&s;e them. The &s;hower which had driven them, as well as my&s;elf, into the hou&s;e, was now over: and as they were pa&s;&s;ing by me into the garden, I a&s;ked them to let me be one of their company.</P>
<P>The gentleman of the hou&s;e told me, If I delighted in flowers, it would be worth my while, for that he believ|ed he could &s;hew me &s;uch a blow of tulips as was not to be matched in the whole country.</P>
<P>I accepted the offer, and immediately found that they had been talking in terms of gardening, and that the kings and generals they had mentioned were only &s;o many tulips, to which the gardeners, according to their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, had given &s;uch high titles and appellations of honour.</P>
<P>I was very much plea&s;ed and a&s;toni&s;hed at the glorious &s;how of the&s;e gay vegetables, that aro&s;e in great profu&s;ion on all the banks about us. Sometimes I con&s;idered them with the eye of an ordinary &s;pectator as &s;o many beauti|ful objects, varni&s;hed over with a natural glo&s;s, and &s;tained with &s;uch a variety of colours, as are not to be equalled in any artificial dyes or tinctures. Sometimes I con&s;idered every leaf as an elaborate piece of ti&s;&s;ue, in which the threads and fibres were woven together into different configurations, which gave a different colouring to the light as it glanced on the &s;everal parts of the &s;ur|face.
<PB N="182" REF="185">
Sometimes I con&s;idered the whole bed of tulips, according to the notion of the greate&s;t mathematician and philo&s;opher that ever lived, as a multitude of optic in&s;truments, de&s;igned for the &s;eparating light into all tho&s;e various colours of which it is compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I was awakened out of the&s;e my philo&s;ophical &s;pecu|lations, by ob&s;erving the company often &s;eemed to laugh at me. I accidentally prai&s;ed a tulip as one of the fine&s;t that I ever &s;aw; upon which they told me, it was a com|mon fool's-coat. Upon that I prai&s;ed a &s;econd, which it &s;eems was but another kind of fool's-coat. I had the &s;ame fate with two or three more; for which rea&s;on I de&s;ired the owner of the garden to let me know which were the fine&s;t of the flowers, for that I was &s;o un&s;kilful in the art, that I thought the mo&s;t beautiful were the mo&s;t valu|able, and that tho&s;e which had the gaye&s;t colours were the mo&s;t beautiful. The gentleman &s;miled at my ignorance: he &s;eemed a very plain hone&s;t man, and a per&s;on of good &s;en&s;e, had not his head been touched with that di&s;temper which Hippocrates calls the Tulippo-Mania, <GAP DESC="foreign" EXTENT="1 word">; in&s;omuch that he would talk very rationally on any &s;ubject in the world but a tulip.</P>
<P>He told me, that he valued the bed of flowers which lay before us, and was not above twenty yards in length, and two in breadth, more than he would the be&s;t hundred acres of land in England; and added, that it would have been worth twice the money it is, if a fooli&s;h cook-maid of his had not almo&s;t ruined him the la&s;t winter, by mi&s;taking an handful of tulip-roots for an heap of onions, and by that means, &s;ays he, made me a di&s;h of pottage, that co&s;t me above 1000 l. &s;terling. He then &s;hewed me what he thought the fine&s;t of his tulips, which I found received all their value from their rarity and oddne&s;s, and put me in mind of your great fortunes, which are not always the greate&s;t beauties.</P>
<P>I have often looked upon it as a piece of happine&s;s, that I have never fallen into any of the&s;e fanta&s;tical ta&s;tes, nor e&s;teemed any thing the more for its being uncommon
<PB N="183" REF="186">
and hard to be met with. For this rea&s;on, I look upon the whole country in &s;pring-time as a &s;pacious garden, and make as many vi&s;its to a &s;pot of dai&s;ies, or a bank of violets, as a flori&s;t does to his borders and parterres. There is not a bu&s;h in blo&s;&s;om within a mile of me which I am not acquainted with, nor &s;carce a daffadil or cow|&s;lip that withers away in my neighbourhood without my mi&s;&s;ing it. I walked home in this temper of mind through &s;everal fields and meadows with an un&s;peakable plea&s;ure, not without reflecting on the bounty of providence, which has made the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and mo&s;t beautiful ob|jects the mo&s;t ordinary and mo&s;t common.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own apartment, <DATE>September 4.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING received many letters filled with compli|ments and acknowlegements for my late u&s;eful di&s;|covery of the political barometer, I &s;hall here commu|nicate to the public an account of my eccle&s;ia&s;tical ther|mometer, the latter giving as manife&s;t progno&s;tications of the changes and revolutions in church, as the former does of tho&s;e in &s;tate, and both of them being ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary for every prudent &s;ubject who is re&s;olved to keep what he has, and get what he can.</P>
<P>The church thermometer, which I am now to treat of, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been invented in the reign of Henry the eighth, about the time when that religious prince put &s;ome to death for owning the pope's &s;upremacy, and o|thers for denying tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. I do not find, how|ever, any great u&s;e made of this in&s;trument till it fell into the hands of a learned and viligant prie&s;t or mini&s;ter, for he frequently wrote him&s;elf both one and the other, who was &s;ome time vicar of Bray. This gentleman lived in
<PB N="184" REF="187">
his vicarage to a good old age; and after having &s;een &s;eve|ral &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of his neighbouring clergy either burnt or bani&s;hed, departed this life with the &s;atisfaction of having never de&s;erted his flock, and died vicar of Bray. As this gla&s;s was fir&s;t de&s;igned to calculate the different degrees of heat in religion, as it raged in popery, or as it cooled and grew temperate in the reformation, it was marked at &s;everal di&s;tances, after the manner our ordinary thermo|meter is to this day, <HI>viz. Extreme hot, Sultry hot, Very hot, Hot, Warm, Temperate, Cold, Ju&s;t freezing, Fro&s;t, Hard fro&s;t, Great fro&s;t, Extreme cold.</HI></P>
<P>It is well known, that Torricellius, the inventor of the common weather-gla&s;s, made the experiment in a long tube which held thirty-two foot of water; and that a more modern virtuo&s;o finding &s;uch a machine altogether unwieldy and u&s;ele&s;s, and con&s;idering that thirty-two inches of quick&s;ilver weighed as much as &s;o many foot of water in a tube of the &s;ame circumference, invented that &s;izeable in&s;trument which is now in u&s;e. After this manner, that I might adapt the thermometer I am now &s;peaking of to the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of our church, as divided in|to High and Low, I have made &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary variations both in the tube and the fluid it contains. In the fir&s;t place, I ordered a tube to be ca&s;t in a planetary hour; and took care to &s;eal it hermetically, when the &s;un was in conjunction was Saturn. I then took the proper pre|cautions about the fluid, which is a compound of two very different liquors: one of them a &s;pirit drawn out of a &s;trong heady wine; the other a particular &s;ort of rock-water, colder than ice, and clearer than cry&s;tal. The &s;pirit is of a red fiery colour, and &s;o very apt to ferment, that unle&s;s it be mingled with a proportion of the water, or pent up very clo&s;e, it will bur&s;t the ve&s;&s;el that holds it, and fly up in fume and &s;moke. The water on the contrary is of &s;uch a &s;ubtle piercing cold, that unle&s;s it be mingled with a proportion of the &s;pirits, it will &s;ink through almo&s;t every thing that it is put into, and &s;eems to be of the &s;ame nature as the water mentioned by
<PB N="185" REF="188">
Quintus Curtius, which, &s;ays the hi&s;torian, could be con|tained in nothing but in the hoof, or, as the Oxford manu&s;cript has it, in the &s;kull of an a&s;s. The thermo|meter is marked according to the following figure, which I &s;et down at length, not only to give my reader a clear idea of it, but al&s;o to fill up my paper.<LIST>

<ITEM>Wrath.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Zeal.</ITEM>
<ITEM>CHURCH.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Moderation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Lukewarmne&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>In&s;idelity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Ignorance.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The reader will ob&s;erve that the church is placed in the middle point of the gla&s;s, between Zeal and Mode|ration, the &s;ituation in which &s;he always flouri&s;hes, and in which every good Engli&s;hman wi&s;hes her who is a friend to the con&s;titution of his country. However, when it mounts to Zeal, it is not ami&s;s; and when it &s;inks to Moderation, is &s;till in a mo&s;t admirable temper. The wor&s;t of it is, that when once it begins to ri&s;e, it has &s;till an inclination to a&s;cend, in&s;omuch that it is apt to climb from Zeal to Wrath, and from Wrath to Per&s;ecution, which always ends in Ignorance, and very often proceeds from it. In the &s;ame manner it frequently takes its pro|gre&s;s through the lower half of the gla&s;s; and when it has a tendency to fall, will gradually de&s;cend from Mo|deration to Lukewarmne&s;s, and from Lukewarmne&s;s to In&s;idelity, which very often terminates in Ignorance, and always proceeds from it.</P>
<P>It is a common ob&s;ervation, that the ordinary ther|mometer will be affected by the breathing of people who are in the room where it &s;tands; and indeed it is almo&s;t incredible to conceive how the gla&s;s I am now de&s;cribing will fall by the breath of a multitude crying Popery; or on
<PB N="186" REF="189">
on the contrary, how it will ri&s;e when the &s;ame multi|tude, as it &s;ometimes happens, cry out in the &s;ame breath, <HI>the Church is in danger.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had fini&s;hed this my gla&s;s, and adju&s;ted it to the abovementioned &s;cale of religion, that I might make proper experiments with it, I carried it under my cloak to &s;everal coffee-hou&s;es, and other places of re&s;ort about this great city. At St. James's coffee-hou&s;e, the liquor &s;tood at Moderation; but at Wills's to my ex|treme &s;urprize, it &s;ub&s;ided to the very lowe&s;t mark on the gla&s;s. At the Grecian it mounted but ju&s;t one point higher; at the Rainbow it &s;till a&s;cended two degrees: Child's fetched it up to Zeal, and other adjacent coffee-hou&s;es to Wrath.</P>
<P>It fell into the lower half of the gla&s;s as I went fur|ther into the city, till at length it &s;ettled at Moderation, where it continued all the time I &s;tayed about the Change, as al&s;o whil&s;t I pa&s;&s;ed by the Bank. And here I cannot but take notice, that through the whole cour&s;e of my re|marks, I never ob&s;erved my gla&s;s to ri&s;e at the &s;ame time that the &s;tocks did.</P>
<P>To complete the experiment, I prevailed upon a friend of mine, who works under me in the occult &s;cien|ces, to make a progre&s;s with my gla&s;s through the whole i&s;land of Great Britain; and after his return, to pre&s;ent me with a regi&s;ter of his ob&s;ervations. I gue&s;&s;ed before|hand at the temper of &s;everal places he pa&s;&s;ed through, by the characters they have had, time out of mind. Thus that facetious divine, Dr. Fuller, &s;peaking of the town of Banbury, near a hundred years ago, tells us, it was a place famous for cakes and Zeal, which I find by my gla&s;s is true to this day as to the latter part of this de|&s;cription; though I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it is not in the &s;ame reputation for cakes that it was in the time of that learn|ed author; and thus of other places. In &s;hort, I have now by me, dige&s;ted in an alphabetical order, all the coun|ties, corporations and boroughs in Great Britain, with their re&s;pective tempers, as they &s;tand related to my ther|mometer:
<PB N="187" REF="190">
but this I &s;hall keep to my&s;elf, becau&s;e I would by no means do any thing that may &s;eem to influence any en&s;uing elections.</P>
<P>The point of doctrine which I would propagate by this my invention, is the &s;ame which was long ago ad|vanced by that able teacher Horace, out of whom I have taken my text for this di&s;cour&s;e: we &s;hould be care|ful not to over&s;hoot our&s;elves in the pur&s;uits even of virtue. Whether Zeal or Moderation be the point we aim at, let us keep fire out of the one, and fro&s;t out of the other. But alas! the world is too wi&s;e to want &s;uch a precaution. The terms High Church and Low Church, as commonly u&s;ed, do not &s;o much denote a principle, as they di&s;tingui&s;h a party. They are like words of battle, that have nothing to do with their original &s;ignification, but are only given out to keep a body of men together, and to let them know friends from enemies.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have con&s;idered with &s;ome little at|tention the influence which the opinions of the&s;e great national &s;ects have upon their practice; and do look up|on it as one of the unaccountable things of our times, that multitudes of hone&s;t gentlemen, who entirely agree in their lives, &s;hould take it in their heads to differ in their religion.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From my own apartment, <DATE>September 13.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT is my cu&s;tom in a dearth of news, to entertain my|&s;elf with tho&s;e collections of adverti&s;ements that appear at the end of all our public prints. The&s;e I con&s;ider as ac|counts of news from the little world, in the &s;ame manner that the foregoing parts of the paper are from the great. If in one we hear that a &s;overeign prince is fled from his capital city, in the other we hear of a trade&s;man who hath &s;hut up his &s;hop, and run away. If in one we find
<PB N="188" REF="191">
the victory of a general, in the other we &s;ee the de&s;ertion of a private &s;oldier. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have a certain weakne&s;s in my temper, that is often very much affected by the&s;e little dome&s;tic occurrences, and have frequently been caught with tears in my eyes over a melancholy adverti&s;ement.</P>
<P>But to con&s;ider this &s;ubject in its mo&s;t ridiculous lights, adverti&s;ements are of great u&s;e to the vulgar: fir&s;t of all, as they are in&s;truments of ambition. A man that is by no means big enough for the Gazette, may ea&s;ily creep into the adverti&s;ements; by which means we often &s;ee an apothecary in the &s;ame paper of news with a plenipo|tentiary, or a running-footman with an amba&s;&s;ador. An adverti&s;ement from Pickadilly goes down to po&s;terity, with an article from Madrid; and John Bartlett of Good|man's Fields is celebrated in the &s;ame paper with the emperor of Germany. Thus the fable tells us, that the wren mounted as high as the eagle, by getting upon his back.</P>
<P>A &s;econd u&s;e which this &s;ort of writings have been turned to of late years, has been the management of con|trover&s;y, in&s;omuch that above half the adverti&s;ements one meets with now-a-days are purely polemical. The inventors of Strops for Razors have written again&s;t one another this way for &s;everal years, and that with great bitterne&s;s; as the whole argument <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI> in the ca&s;e of the Morning Gowns is &s;till carried on after the &s;ame manner. I need not mention the &s;everal proprietors of Dr. Ander&s;on's pills; nor take notice of the many &s;a|tirical works of this nature &s;o frequently publi&s;hed by Dr. Clark, who has had the confidence to adverti&s;e upon that learned knight, my very worthy friend, Sir William Read: But I &s;hall not interpo&s;e in their quarrel; Sir Wil|liam can give him his own in adverti&s;ements, that, in the judgment of the impartial, are as well penned as the do|ctor's.</P>
<P>The third and la&s;t u&s;e of the&s;e writings is, to inform the world where they may be furni&s;hed with almo&s;t every
<PB N="189" REF="192">
thing that is nece&s;&s;ary for life. If a man has pains in his head, cholics in his bowels, or &s;pots in his clothes, he may here meet with proper cures and remedies. If a man would recover a wife or a hor&s;e that is &s;tolen or &s;trayed; if he wants new &s;ermons, electuaries, a&s;&s;es milk, or any thing el&s;e, either for his body or his mind, this is the place to look for them in.</P>
<P>The great art in writing adverti&s;ements, is the find|ing out a proper method to catch the reader's eye, with|out which a good thing may pa&s;s over unob&s;erved, or be lo&s;t among commi&s;&s;ions of bankrupt. A&s;teri&s;ks and hands were formerly of great u&s;e for this purpo&s;e. Of late years, the <HI>N.B.</HI> has been much in fa&s;hion; as al&s;o little cuts and figures, the invention of which we mu&s;t a&s;cribe to the author of &s;pring-tru&s;&s;es. I mu&s;t not here omit the blind Italian character, which being &s;carce legible, always fixes and detains the eye, and gives the curious reader &s;omething like the &s;atisfaction of prying into a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>But the great &s;kill in an adverti&s;er is chiefly &s;een in the &s;tile which he makes u&s;e of. He is to mention <HI>the univer&s;al e&s;teem, or general reputation,</HI> of things that were never heard of. If he is a phy&s;ician or a&s;trologer, he mu&s;t change his lodgings frequently, and (though he never &s;aw any body in them be&s;ides his own family) give public notice of it, <HI>For the information of the nobility and gentry.</HI> Since I am thus u&s;efully employed in writing cri|tici&s;ms on the works of the&s;e diminutive authors, I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over in &s;ilence an adverti&s;ement which has lately made its appearance, and is written altogether in the Ci|ceronian manner. It was &s;ent to me, with five &s;hillings, to be in&s;erted among my adverti&s;ements; but as it is a pattern of good writing in this way, I &s;hall give it a place in the body of my paper.</P>
<P>THE highe&s;t compound &s;pirit of lavender, the mo&s;t glorious, if the expre&s;&s;ion may be u&s;ed, enlivening &s;cent and flavour that can po&s;&s;ibly be, which &s;o raptures the &s;pirits, delights the gu&s;t, and gives &s;uch airs to the countenance,
<PB N="190" REF="193">
as are not to be imagined but by tho&s;e that have tried it. The meane&s;t &s;ort of the thing is admired by mo&s;t gentle|men and ladies; but this far more, as by far it exceeds it, to the gaining among all a more than common e&s;teem. It is &s;old (in neat flint bottles fit for the pocket) only at the Golden-key in Wharton's-court near Holborn-bars, for 3 s. 6 d. with directions.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that I recommend the &s;everal flow|ers in which this &s;pirit of lavender is wrapped up, if the expre&s;&s;ion may be u&s;ed, I cannot excu&s;e my fellow-la|bourers for admitting into their papers &s;everal uncleanly adverti&s;ements, not at all proper to appear in the works of polite writers. Among the&s;e I mu&s;t reckon the Car|minitive Wind-expelling pills. If the doctor had called them his carminitive pills, he had done as cleanly as any one could have wi&s;hed; but the &s;econd word entirely de|&s;troys the decency of the fir&s;t. There are other ab&s;urdi|ties of this nature &s;o very gro&s;s, that I dare not mention them; and &s;hall therefore di&s;mi&s;s this &s;ubject, with a public admonition to Michael Parrot, that he do not pre&s;ume any more to mention a certain worm he knows of, which, by the way, has grown &s;even foot in my me|mory; for, if I am not much mi&s;taken, it is the &s;ame that was but nine foot long about &s;ix months ago.</P>
<P>By the remarks I have here made, it plainly appears, that a collection of adverti&s;ements is a kind of mi&s;cellany; the writers of which, contrary to all authors, except men of quality, give money to the book&s;ellers who publi&s;h their copies. The genius of the book&s;eller is chiefly &s;hewn in his method of ranging and dige&s;ting the&s;e lit|tle tracts. The la&s;t paper I took up in my hands, places them in the following order.<LIST>

<P>IT is one of the de&s;igns of this paper to tran&s;mit to po|&s;terity an account of every thing that is mon&s;trous in my own times. For this rea&s;on I &s;hall here publi&s;h to the world the life of a per&s;on who was neither man nor wo|man, as written by one of my ingenious corre&s;pondents, who &s;eems to have imitated Plutarch in that multifarious erudition, and tho&s;e occa&s;ional di&s;&s;ertations, which he has wrought into the body of his hi&s;tory. The life I am putting out, is that of Margery, alias John Young, commonly known by the name of Dr. Young, who, as the town very well knows, was a woman that practi&s;ed phy&s;ic in man's clothes, and after having had two wives and &s;everal children, died about a month &s;ince.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HERE make bold to trouble you with a &s;hort ac|count of the famous doctor Young's life, which you may call, if you plea&s;e, a &s;econd part of the farce of the Sham Doctor. This perhaps will not &s;eem &s;o &s;trange to you, who, if I am not mi&s;taken, have &s;ome where mentioned with honour your &s;i&s;ter Kirleus, as a pra|ctitioner both in phy&s;ic and a&s;trology: but in the com|mon opinion of mankind, a She-quack is altogether as &s;trange and a&s;toni&s;hing a creature as a centaur that practi&s;ed phy&s;ic in the days of Achilles, or as king Phys in the Rehear&s;al. Ae&s;culapius, the great founder of your
<PB N="192" REF="195">
art, was particularly famous for his beard, as we may conclude from the behaviour of a tyrant, who is brand|ed by heathen hi&s;torians as guilty both of &s;acrilege and bla&s;phemy, having robbed the &s;tatue of Ae&s;cula|pius of a thick bu&s;hy golden beard, and then alleged for his excu&s;e, <HI>That it was a &s;hame that the &s;on &s;hould have a beard when his father Apollo had none.</HI> This latter in&s;tance indeed &s;eems &s;omething to favour a female pro|fe&s;&s;or, &s;ince, as I have been told, the ancient &s;tatues of Apollo are generally made with the head and face of a woman: nay I have been credibly informed by tho&s;e who have &s;een them both, that the famous Apollo in the Belvidera did very much re&s;emble Dr. Young. Let that be as it will, the doctor was a kind of Amazon in phy&s;ic, that made as great deva&s;tations and &s;laughters as any of our chief heroes in the art, and was as fatal to the Engli&s;h in the&s;e our days, as the famous Joan d' Arc was in tho&s;e of our forefathers.</P>
<P>I do not find any thing remarkable in the life I am about to write till the year 1695, at which time the do|ctor being about twenty-three years old, was brought to bed of a ba&s;tard child. The &s;candal of &s;uch a misfortune gave &s;o great unea&s;ine&s;s to pretty Mrs. Peggy, (for that was the name by which the doctor was then called) that &s;he left her family, and follow|ed her lover to London, with a fixed re&s;olution &s;ome way or other to recover her lo&s;t reputation; but in|&s;tead of changing her life, which one would have ex|pected from &s;o good a di&s;po&s;ition of mind, &s;he took it in her head to change her &s;ex This was &s;oon done by the help of a &s;word, and a pair of breeches. I have rea&s;on to believe, that her fir&s;t de&s;ign was to turn man-mid|wife, having her&s;elf had &s;ome experience in tho&s;e affairs: but thinking this too narrow a foundation for her fu|ture fortune, &s;he at length bought her a gold button coat, and &s;et up for a phy&s;ician. Thus we &s;ee the &s;ame fatal mi&s;carriage in her youth made Mrs. Young a doctor, that formerly made one of the &s;ame &s;ex a pope.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="196">
The doctor &s;ucceeded very well in his bu&s;ine&s;s at fir&s;t, but very often met with accidents that di&s;quieted him. As he wanted that deep magi&s;terial voice, which gives authority to a pre&s;cription, and is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the right pronouncing of tho&s;e words, <HI>Take the&s;e pills,</HI> he unfortunately got the nick-name of the Squeak|ing Doctor. If this circum&s;tance alarmed the Doctor, there was another that gave him no &s;mall di&s;quiet, and very much dimini&s;hed his gains. In &s;hort, he found him&s;elf run down as a &s;uperficial prating quack, in all families that had at the head of them a cautious father, or a jealous hu&s;band. The&s;e would often com|plain among one another, that they did not like &s;uch a &s;mock-faced phy&s;ician; though in truth had they known how ju&s;tly he de&s;erved that name, they would rather have favoured his practice, than have appre|hended any thing from it.</P>
<P>Such were the motives that determined Mrs. Young to change her condition, and take in marriage a vir|tuous young woman, who lived with her in good re|putation, and made her the father of a very pretty girl. But this part of her happine&s;s was &s;oon after de|&s;troyed by a di&s;temper which was too hard for our phy&s;ician, and carried off his wife. The doctor had not been a widow long, before he married his &s;econd lady, with whom al&s;o he lived in a very good under|&s;tanding. It &s;o happened that the doctor was with child at the &s;ame time that his lady was; but the lit|tle ones coming both together, they pa&s;&s;ed for twins. The doctor having entirely e&s;tabli&s;hed the reputation of his manhood, e&s;pecially by the birth of the boy of whom he had been lately delivered, and who very much re&s;embles him, grew into good bu&s;ine&s;s, and was parti|cularly famous for the cure of venereal di&s;tempers; but would had much more practice among his own &s;ex, had not &s;ome of them been &s;o unrea&s;onable as to demand certain proofs of their cure, which the doctor was not able to give them. The florid blooming look, which
<PB N="194" REF="197">
gave the doctor &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s at fir&s;t, in&s;tead of be|traying his per&s;on, only recommended his phy&s;ic. Upon this occa&s;ion I cannot forbear mentioning what I thought a very agreeable &s;urprize in one of Moliere's plays, where a young woman applies her&s;elf to a &s;ick per&s;on in the habit of a quack, and &s;peaks to her pa|tient who was &s;omething &s;candalized at the youth of his phy&s;ician, to the following purpo&s;e&mdash;<HI>I begun to pra|cti&s;e in the reign of Francis</HI> I. <HI>and am now in the hundred and fiftieth year of my age; but by the virtue of my me|dicaments, have maintained my&s;elf in the &s;ame beauty and fre&s;hne&s;s I had at fifteen.</HI> For this rea&s;on Hippocrates lays it down as a rule, that a &s;tudent in phy&s;ic &s;hould have a &s;ound con&s;titution, and a healthy look; which indeed &s;eems as nece&s;&s;ary qualifications for a phy&s;ician, as a good life, and virtuous behaviour, for a divine. But to return to our &s;ubject. About two years ago the doctor was very much afflicted with the vapours, which grew upon him to &s;uch a degree, that about &s;ix weeks &s;ince they made an end of him. His death di&s;covered the di&s;gui&s;e he had acted under, and brought him back again to his former &s;ex. It is &s;aid, that at his burial the pall was held up by &s;ix women of &s;ome fa&s;hion. The doctor left behind him a widow and two father|le&s;s children, if they may be called &s;o, be&s;ides the lit|tle boy before mentioned. In relation to whom we may &s;ay of the doctor, as the good old ballad, about <HI>the children in the wood,</HI> &s;ays of the unnatural un|cle, that he was father and mother both in one. The&s;e are all the circum&s;trnces that I could learn of doctor Young's life, which might have given occa&s;ion to many ob&s;cene fictions: but as I know tho&s;e would never have gained a place in your paper, I have not troubled you with any impertinence of that nature; having &s;tuck to the truth very &s;crupulou&s;ly, as I always do when I &s;ub|&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<P>THE whole creation preys upon it&s;elf: every living creature is inhabited. A &s;lea has a thou&s;and invi&s;ible in&s;ects that teaze him as he jumps from place to place, and revenge our quarrels upon him. A very ordinary micro&s;cope &s;hews us, that a lou&s;e is it&s;elf a very lou&s;y creature. A whale, be&s;ides tho&s;e &s;eas and oceans in the &s;everal ve&s;&s;els of his body, which are filled with innume|rable &s;hoals of little animals, carries about it a whole world of inhabitants; in&s;omuch that, if we believe the calcula|tions &s;ome have made, there are more living creatures, which are too &s;mall for the naked eye to behold, about the leviathan, than there are of vi&s;ible creatures upon the face of the whole earth. Thus every nobler creature is as it were the ba&s;is and &s;upport of multitudes that are his inferiors.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration very much comforts me, when I think on tho&s;e numberle&s;s vermin that feed upon this paper, and find their &s;u&s;tenance out of it; I mean the &s;mall wits and &s;cribblers that every day turn a penny by nibbling at my lucubrations.

Should I lay down my paper, what a famine would there be among the hawkers, printers, book&s;ellers and authors? it would be like Dr. B&mdash;s's dropping his cloak, with the whole congregation hanging upon the &s;kirts of it. To enumerate &s;ome of the&s;e my doughty antagoni&s;ts, I was threatened to be an&s;wered weekly Tit for Tat: I was undermined by the Whi&s;perer, haunted by Tom Brown's Gho&s;t, &s;colded at by a Female Tatler, and &s;landered by another of the &s;ame character, under the title of Atalan|tis. I have been <HI>annotated, retattled, examined,</HI> and <HI>condo|led:</HI> but it being my &s;tanding maxim, never to &s;peak ill of the dead; I &s;hall let the&s;e authors re&s;t in peace, and take great plea&s;ure in thinking that I have &s;ometimes been the means of their getting a belly-full. When I &s;ee my&s;elf thus &s;urrounded by &s;uch formidable enemies, I of|ten think of the knight of the Red Cro&s;s in Spen&s;er's Den of Error, who, after he has cut off the dragon's head, and le&s;t it wallowing in a flood of ink, &s;ees a thou&s;and mon&s;trous reptiles making their attempts upon him, one with many heads, another with none, and all of them without eyes.<Q><LG>

<P>IT is ridiculous for any man to critici&s;e on the works of another, who has not di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his own performances. A judge would make but an indiffe|rent figure who had never been known at the bar. Ci|cero was reputed the greate&s;t orator of his age and coun|try before he wrote a book De Oratore; and Horace the greate&s;t poet before he publi&s;hed his Art of Poetry. The ob&s;ervation ari&s;es naturally in any one who ca&s;ts his eye upon this la&s;t mentioned author, where he will find the critici&s;ms placed in the latter end of his book, that is, after the fine&s;t odes and &s;atires in the Latin tongue.</P>
<P>A modern, who&s;e name I &s;hall not mention, becau&s;e I would not make a &s;illy paper &s;ell, was born a critic and an examiner, and, like one of the race of the &s;er|pent's teeth, came into the world with a &s;word in his hand. His works put me in mind of the &s;tory that is told of a German monk, who was taking a catalogue of a friend's library, and meeting with a Hebrew book in it, entered it under the title of, <HI>A book that has the beginning where the end &s;hould be.</HI> This author, in the la&s;t of his crudities, has ama&s;&s;ed together a heap of quotations, to prove that Horace and Virgil were both of them mode&s;ter men than my&s;elf, and if his works were to live as long as mine, they might po&s;&s;ibly give po&s;terity a notion, that I&s;aac Bicker&s;taffe was a very conceited old fellow, and as vain a man as either Tully or Sir Francis Bacon. Had this &s;erious writer fallen upon me only, I could have o|ver-looked it; but to &s;ee Cicero abu&s;ed, is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, what I cannot bear. The cen&s;ure he pa&s;&s;es upon this great man runs thus; <HI>The itch of being very abu&s;ive, is almo&s;t in|&s;eparable from vain-glory. Tully has the&s;e two faults in &s;o high a degree, that nothing but his being the be&s;t writer</HI>
<PB N="199" REF="202">
<HI>in the world can make amends for them.</HI> The &s;currilous wretch goes on to &s;ay I am as bad as Tully. His words are the&s;e; <HI>and yet the Tatler, in his paper of September</HI> 26<HI>th, has out done him in both. He &s;peaks of him&s;elf with more ar|rogance, and with more in&s;olence of others.</HI> I am afraid, by his di&s;cour&s;e, this gentleman has no more read Plutarch than he has Tully. If he had, he would have ob&s;erved a pa&s;&s;age in that hi&s;torian, wherein he has with great deli|cacy di&s;tingui&s;hed between two pa&s;&s;ions which are u&s;ually complicated in human nature, and which an ordinary wri|ter would not have thought of &s;eparating. Not having my Greek &s;pectacles by me, I &s;hall quote the pa&s;&s;age word for word, as I find it tran&s;lated to my hand.<HI>Neverthe|le&s;s, though he was intemperately fond of his own prai&s;e, yet he was very free from envying others, and mo&s;t liberally profu&s;e in commending both the antients and his contemporaries, as is to be under&s;tood by his writings; and many of tho&s;e &s;ayings are &s;till recorded, as that concerning Ari&s;totle, that he was a river of flowing gold: of Plato's dialogue, that if Jupiter were to &s;peak, he would di&s;cour&s;e as he did. Theophra&s;tus he was wont to call his peculiar delight; and being asked, which of Demo&s;thenes's orations he liked be&s;t? He an&s;wered, the longe&s;t.</HI> </P>
<P><HI>And as for eminent men of his own time, either for eloquence or philo&s;ophy, there was not one of them whom he did not, by writing or &s;peaking favourably of, render more illu&s;trious.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the critic tells us, That Cicero was exce&s;&s;ively vain-glorious and abu&s;ive; Plutarch, that he was vain, but not abu&s;ive. Let the reader believe which of them he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>After this he complains to the world, that I call him names; and that in my pa&s;&s;ion I &s;aid, He was a Flea, a Lou&s;e, an Owl, a Bat, a &s;mall Wit, a Scribler, and a Ni|bler. When he has thus be&s;poken his reader's pity, he falls into that admirable vein of mirth, which I &s;hall &s;et, down at length, it being an exqui&s;ite piece of raillery, and written in great gaiety of heart. <HI>After this li&s;t of names,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> Flea, Lou&s;e, Owl, Bat, <HI>etc.</HI>) <HI>I was &s;urpri&s;ed</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="203">
<HI>to hear him &s;ay, that he has hitherto kept his temper pretty well; I wonder how he will write when he has lo&s;t his tem|per! I &s;uppo&s;e, as he now is very angry and unmannerly, he will then be exceeding courteous and good-humoured.</HI> If I can outlive this raillery, I &s;hall be able to bear any thing.</P>
<P>There is a method of critici&s;m made u&s;e of by this au|thor, (for I &s;hall take care how I call him a &s;cribler a|gain) which may turn into ridicule any work that was ever written, wherein there is a variety of thoughts: this the reader will ob&s;erve in the following words; <HI>He,</HI> meaning me, <HI>is &s;o intent upon being &s;omething extraordi|nary, that he &s;carce knows what he would be; and is as fruit|ful in his &s;imiles, as a brother of his whom I lately took notice of. In the compa&s;s of a few lines he compares him&s;elf to a fox, to Daniel Burge&s;s, to the knight of the red cro&s;s, to an oak with ivy about it, and to a great man with an equipage.</HI> I think my&s;elf as much honoured by being joined in this part of his paper with the gentleman whom he here calls my brother, as I am in the beginning of it by being men|tioned with Horace and Virgil.</P>
<P>It is very hard that a man cannot publi&s;h ten papers without &s;tealing from him&s;elf; but to &s;hew you that this is only a knack of writing, and that the author is got in|to a certain road of critici&s;m, I &s;hall &s;et down his remarks on the works of the gentleman whom he here glances upon, as they &s;tand in his 6th paper, and de&s;ire the rea|der to compare them with the foregoing pa&s;&s;age upon mine.</P>
<P><HI>In thirty lines his patron is a river, the Primum Mobile, a pilot, a victim, the &s;un, any thing, and nothing. He be&s;tows increa&s;e, conceals his &s;ource, makes the machine move, teaches to &s;teer, expiates our offences, rai&s;es vapours, and looks larg|er as he &s;ets.</HI></P>
<P>What poem can be &s;afe from this &s;ort of critici&s;m? I think I was never in my life &s;o much offended as at a wag whom I once met with in a coffee-hou&s;e: he had in his hand one of the mi&s;cellanies, and was reading the following &s;hort copy of ver&s;es, which without flattery to
<PB N="201" REF="204">
the author, is, I think, as beautiful in its kind as any one in the Engli&s;h tongue.<Q><L>Flavia the lea&s;t and &s;lighte&s;t toy</L>
<L>Can with re&s;i&s;tle&s;s art employ.</L>
<L>This fan in meaner hands would prove</L>
<L>An engine of &s;mall force in love;</L>
<L>But &s;he with &s;uch an air and mein,</L>
<L>Not to be told or &s;afely &s;een,</L>
<L>Directs its wanton motions &s;o,</L>
<L>That it wounds more than Cupid's bow;</L>
<L>Gives coolne&s;s to the matchle&s;s dame,</L>
<L>To every other brea&s;t a flame.</L></Q></P>
<P>When this coxcomb had done reading them, hey-day! &s;ays he, what in&s;trument is this that Flavia employs in &s;uch a manner as is not to be told, or &s;afely &s;een? In ten lines it is a toy, a Cupid's bow, a fan, and an engine in love. It has wanton motions, it wounds, it cools, and inflames.</P>
<P>Such critici&s;ms make a man of &s;en&s;e &s;ick, and a fool merry.</P>
<P>The next paragraph of the paper we are talking of, falls upon &s;ome body whom I am at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s at: but I find the whole invective turns upon a man who, it &s;eems, has been impri&s;oned for debt. Whoever he was, I mu&s;t heartily pity him; but at the &s;ame time mu&s;t put the Examiner, in mind, that notwith&s;tanding he is a cri|tic, he &s;till ought to remember he is a Chri&s;tian. Poverty was never thought a proper &s;ubject for ridicule; and I do not remember that I ever met with a &s;atire upon a beggar.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e little retortings of my own expre&s;&s;ions, of <HI>being dull by de&s;ign, witty in October, &s;hining, excelling,</HI> and &s;o forth; they are the common cavils of every wit|lin, who has no other method of &s;hewing his parts, but by little variations and repetitions of the man's words whom he attacks.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="205">
But the truth of it is, the paper before me, not only in this particular, but in its very e&s;&s;ence is like Ovid's echo:
<Q><L>&mdash;Quae nec reticere loquenti,</L>
<L>Nec prior ip&s;a loqui didicit.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hould not have de&s;erved the character of a Cen&s;or, had I not animadverted upon the above-mentioned au|thor by a gentle cha&s;ti&s;ement: But I know my reader will not pardon me, unle&s;s I declare, that nothing of this nature for the future, unle&s;s it be written with &s;ome wit, &s;hall divert me from my care of the public.</P>

<P>I DO not remember that in any of my lucubrations I have touched upon that u&s;eful &s;cience of phy&s;ic, not|with&s;tanding I have declared my&s;elf more than once a pro|fe&s;&s;or of it. I have indeed joined the &s;tudy of a&s;trology with it, becau&s;e I never knew a phy&s;ician recommend him&s;elf to the public who had not a &s;i&s;ter art to embelli&s;h his knowlege in medicine. It has been commonly ob&s;er|ved in compliment to the ingenious of our profe&s;&s;ion, that Apollo was the god of ver&s;e as well as phy&s;ic; and in all ages the mo&s;t celebrated practitioners of our coun|try were the particular favourites of the mu&s;es. Poetry to phy&s;ic is indeed like the gilding to a pill; it makes the art &s;hine, and covers the &s;everity of the doctor with the agreeablene&s;s of the companion.</P>
<P>The very foundation of poetry is good &s;en&s;e, if we may allow Horace to be a judge of the art.<Q><L>Scribendi recte &s;apere e&s;t, et principium, et fons.</L></Q></P>

man who writes well can pre&s;cribe well, if he has applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of both. Be&s;ides, when we &s;ee a man making profe&s;&s;ion of two different &s;ciences, it is natural for us to believe he is no pretender in that which we are not judges of, when we find him &s;kilful in that which we under&s;tand.</P>
<P>Ordinary quacks and charlatans are throughly &s;en&s;i|ble how nece&s;&s;ary it is to &s;upport them&s;elves by the&s;e collateral a&s;&s;i&s;tances, and therefore always lay their claim to &s;ome &s;upernumerary accompli&s;hments which are whol|ly foreign to their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>About twenty years ago, it was impo&s;&s;ible to walk the &s;treets without having an adverti&s;ement thru&s;t into your hand of a doctor <HI>who was arrived at the knowlege of the green and red dragon, and had di&s;covered the female fern &s;eed.</HI> No body every knew what this meant; but the green and red dragon &s;o amu&s;ed the people, that the doctor lived very comfortably upon them. About the &s;ame time there was pa&s;ted a very hard word upon every corner of the &s;treets. This, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, was<Q>TETRACHYMAGOGON,</Q> which drew great &s;hoals of &s;pectators about it, who read the bill that it introduced with un&s;peakable curio&s;ity; and when they were &s;ick, would have no body but this learn|ed man for their phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>I once received an adverti&s;ement of one <HI>who &s;tudied thirty years by candle-light for the good of his countrymen.</HI> He might have &s;tudied twice as long by day-light, and ne|ver have been taken notice of: but elucubrations cannot be over-valued. There are &s;ome who have gained them&s;elves great reputation &s;or phy&s;ic by their birth, as the <HI>&s;eventh &s;on of a &s;eventh &s;on;</HI> and others by not being born at all, as the Unborn Doctor, who, I hear, is lately gone the way of his patients, having died worth five hundred pounds per annum, though he was not <HI>born</HI> to a halfpenny.</P>
<P>My ingenious friend doctor Saffold &s;ucceeded my old
<PB N="204" REF="207">
contemporary doctor Lilly in the &s;tudies both of phy&s;ic and a&s;trology, to which he added that of poetry, as was to be &s;een both upon the &s;ign where he lived, and in the bills which he di&s;tributed. He was &s;ucceeded by doctor Ca&s;e, who era&s;ed the ver&s;es of his predece&s;&s;or out of the &s;ign-po&s;t, and &s;ub&s;tituted in their &s;tead two of his own, which were as follow:
<Q><L>Within this place</L>
<L>Lives doctor Ca&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>He is &s;aid to have got more by this di&s;tich, than Mr. Dryden did by all his works. There would be no end of enumerating the &s;everal imaginary perfections and unac|countable artifices by which this tribe of men en&s;nare the minds of the vulgar, and gain crouds of admirers. I have &s;een the whole front of a mountebank's &s;tage from one end to the other faced with patents, certificates, me|dals, and great &s;eals, by which the &s;everal princes of Europe have te&s;tified their particular re&s;pect and e&s;teem for the doctor. Every great man with a &s;ounding title has been his patient. I believe I have &s;een twenty mountebanks that have given phy&s;ic to the Czar of Mu&s;covy. The great duke of Tu&s;cany e&s;capes no better. The elector of Bran|denburg was likewi&s;e a very good patient.</P>
<P>This great conde&s;cen&s;ion of the doctor draws upon him much good-will from his audience; and it is ten to one, but if any of them be troubled with an aching tooth, his ambition will prompt him to get it drawn by a per&s;on who has had &s;o many princes, kings, and emperors un|der his hands.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not leave this &s;ubject without ob&s;erving, that as phy&s;icians are apt to deal in poetry, apothecaries endea|vour to recommend them&s;elves by oratory, and are there|fore without controver&s;y the mo&s;t eloquent per&s;ons in the whole Briti&s;h nation. I would not willingly di&s;cou|rage any of the arts, e&s;pecially that of which I am an humble profe&s;&s;or; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, for the good of
<PB N="205" REF="208">
my native country, I could wi&s;h there might be a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of phy&s;ic for &s;ome years, that our kingdom, which has been &s;o much exhau&s;ted by the wars, might have leave to recruit it&s;elf.</P>
<P>As for my&s;elf, the only phy&s;ic which has brought me &s;afe to almo&s;t the age of man, and which I pre&s;cribe to all my friends, is ab&s;tinence. This is certainly the be&s;t phy&s;ic for prevention, and very often the mo&s;t effectual again&s;t the pre&s;ent di&s;temper. In &s;hort, my <HI>recipe</HI> is, <HI>Take nothing.</HI></P>
<P>Were the body politic to be phy&s;icked like particular per&s;ons, I &s;hould venture to pre&s;cribe to it after the &s;ame manner. I remember when our whole i&s;land was &s;haken with an earthquake &s;ome years ago, there was an impu|dent mountebank who &s;old pills, which (as he told the country people) were very good again&s;t an earthquake. It may perhaps be thought as ab&s;urd to pre&s;cribe a diet for the allaying popular commotions, and national fer|ments. But I am verily per&s;uaded, that if in &s;uch a ca&s;e a whole people were to enter into a cour&s;e of ab&s;tinence, and eat nothing but water-gruel for a fortnight, it would abate the rage and animo&s;ity of parties, and not a little contribute to the cure of a di&s;tracted nation. Such a fa&s;t would have a natural tendency to the procuring of tho&s;e ends for which a fa&s;t is u&s;ually proclaimed. If any man has a mind to enter on &s;uch a voluntary ab&s;tinence, it might not be improper to give him the caution of Py|thagoras in particular,
<Q><L>Ab&s;tine a fabis.</L></Q><Q><L>Ab&s;tain from beans.</L></Q>
That is, &s;ay the interpreters, meddle not with elections, beans having been made u&s;e of by the voters among the Athenians in the choice of magi&s;trates.</P>

<P>I HAVE &s;omewhere made mention of Gyges's ring, and intimated to my reader, that it was at pre&s;ent in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, though I have not &s;ince made any u&s;e of it. The tradition concerning this ring is very romantic, and taken notice of both by Plato and Tully, who each of them make an admirable u&s;e of it for the advancement of morality. This Gyges was the ma&s;ter &s;hepherd to king Candaules. As he was wandering over the plains of Ly|dia, he &s;aw a great cha&s;m in the earth, and had the curi|o&s;ity to enter it. After having de&s;cended pretty far into it, he found the &s;tatue of an hor&s;e in bra&s;s, with doors in the &s;ides of it. Upon opening of them, he found the body of a dead man bigger than ordinary, with a ring upon his finger, which he took off, and put it upon his own. The virtues of it were much greater than he at fir&s;t imagined; for upon his going into the a&s;&s;embly of &s;hepherds, he ob&s;erved, that he was invi&s;ible when he turn|ed the &s;tone of the ring within the palm of his hand, and vi&s;ible when he turned it towards his company. Had Pla|to and Cicero been as well ver&s;ed in the occult &s;ciences as I am, they would have found a great deal of my&s;tic learn|ing in this tradition; but it is impo&s;&s;ible for an adept to be under&s;tood by one who is not an adept.</P>
<P>As for my&s;elf, I have with much &s;tudy and application arrived at this great &s;ecret of making my&s;elf invi&s;ible, and by that means conveying my&s;elf where I plea&s;e; or to &s;peak in Ro&s;ycrucian lore, I have entered into the clefts of the earth, di&s;covered the brazen hor&s;e, and robbed the dead giant of his ring. The tradition &s;ays further of Gy|ges, that by the means of this ring he gained admi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="207" REF="210">
into the mo&s;t retired parts of the court, and made &s;uch u&s;e of tho&s;e opportunities, that he at length became king of Lydia. For my own part, I, who have always rather endeavoured to improve my mind than my fortune, have turned this ring to no other advantage than to get a thorough in&s;ight into the ways of men, and to make &s;uch ob&s;ervations upon the errors of others as may be u&s;eful to the public, whatever effect they may have upon my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>About a week ago, not being able to &s;leep, I got up and put on my magical ring, and with a thought tran&s;|ported my&s;elf into a chamber where I &s;aw a light. I found it inhabited by a celebrated beauty, though &s;he is of that &s;pecies of women which we call a &s;lattern. Her head-dre&s;s and one of her &s;hoes lay upon a chair, her petticoat in one corner of the room, and her girdle, that had a copy of ver&s;es made upon it but the day before, with her thread &s;tockings, in the middle of the floor. I was &s;o fooli&s;hly officious, that I could not forbear gathering up her clothes together to lay them upon the chair that &s;tood by her bed-&s;ide, when, to my great &s;urprize, after a little mut|tering, &s;he cried out, <HI>What do you do? Let my petticoat a|lone.</HI> I was &s;tartled at fir&s;t, but &s;oon found that &s;he was in a dream; being one of tho&s;e who (to u&s;e Shake&s;pear's expre&s;&s;ion) are <HI>&s;o loo&s;e of thought,</HI> that they utter in their &s;leep every thing that pa&s;&s;es in their imagination. I left the apartment of this female rake, and went into her neigh|bour's, where there lay a male-coquet. He had a bottle of &s;alts hanging over his head, and upon the table, by his bed-&s;ide, <HI>Suckling</HI>'s poems, with a little heap of black patches on it. His &s;nuff-box was within reach on a chair: but while I was admiring the di&s;po&s;ition which he made of the &s;everal parts of his dre&s;s, his &s;lumber &s;eemed in|terrupted by a pang, that was accompanied by a &s;udden oath, as he turned him&s;elf over ha&s;tily in his bed. I did not care for &s;eeing him in his nocturnal pains, and left the room.</P>
<P>I was no &s;ooner got into another bed-chamber, but I
<PB N="208" REF="211">
heard very har&s;h words uttered in a &s;mooth uniform tone. I was amazed to hear &s;o great a volubility in reproach, and thought it too coherent to be &s;poken by one a&s;leep; but upon looking nearer, I &s;aw the head dre&s;s of the per|&s;on who &s;poke, which &s;hewed her to be a female with a man lying by her &s;ide broad awake, and as quiet as a lamb. I could not but admire his exemplary patience, and di&s;|covered by his whole behaviour, that he was then lying under the di&s;cipline of a curtain-lecture.</P>
<P>I was entertained in many other places with this kind of nocturnal eloquence, but ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t of tho&s;e whom I found awake, were kept &s;o either by envy or by love. Some of the&s;e were &s;ighing, and others cur&s;ing, in &s;oliloquy; &s;ome hugged their pillows, and others gna&s;h|ed their teeth.</P>
<P>The covetous I likewi&s;e found to be a very wakeful people. I happened to come into a room where one of them lay &s;ick. His phy&s;ician and his wife were in clo&s;e whi&s;per near his bed-&s;ide. I overheard the doctor &s;ay to the gentlewoman, He cannot po&s;&s;ibly live till five in the morning. She received it like the mi&s;tre&s;s of a family prepared for all events. At the &s;ame in&s;tant came in a &s;ervant maid, who &s;aid, <HI>Madam, The undertaker is below according to your order.</HI> The words were &s;carce out of her mouth, when the &s;ick man cried out with a feeble voice, Pray, doctor, how went bank &s;tock to day at <HI>Change?</HI> This melancholy object made me too &s;erious for divert|ing my&s;elf further this way; but as I was going home, I &s;aw a light in a garret, and entering into it, heard a voice crying, And, Hand, Stand, Band, Fann'd, Tann'd. I con|cluded him by this and the furniture of his room to be a lunatic; but upon li&s;tening a little longer, perceived it was a poet, writing an heroic upon the en&s;uing peace.</P>
<P>It was now towards morning, an hour when &s;pirits, witches, and conjurers are obliged to retire to their own apartments; and feeling the influence of it, I was ha&s;ten|ing home, when I &s;aw a man had got half way into a neighbour's hou&s;e. I immediately called to him, and turn|ing
<PB N="209" REF="212">
my ring, appeared in my proper per&s;on. There is &s;omething magi&s;terial in the a&s;pect of the Bicker&s;taffes, which made him run away in confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>As I took a turn or two in my own lodging, I was thinking, that, old as I was, I need not go to bed alone, but that it was in my power to marry the fine&s;t lady in this kingdom, if I would wed her with this ring. For what a figure would &s;he, that &s;hould have it, make at a vi|&s;it, with &s;o perfect a knowlege as this would give her of all the &s;candal in the town! But in&s;tead of endeavouring to di&s;po&s;e of my&s;elf and it in matrimony, I re&s;olved to lend it to my loving friend the author of the Atalantis, to fur|ni&s;h a new Secret Hi&s;tory of Secret Memoirs.</P>

<P>I WAS la&s;t night vi&s;ited by a friend of mine, who has an inexhau&s;tible fund of di&s;cour&s;e, and never fails to en|tertain his company with a variety of thoughts and hints that are altogether new and uncommon. Whether it were in complai&s;ance to my way of living, or his real opinion, he advanced the following paradox, That it required much greater talents to fill up and become a retired life, than a life of bu&s;ine&s;s. Upon this occa&s;ion he rallied very a|greeably the bu&s;y men of the age, who only valued them|&s;elves for being in motion, and pa&s;&s;ing through a &s;eries of trifling and in&s;ignificant actions. In the heat of his di&s;|cour&s;e, &s;eeing a piece of money lying on my table, I de|fy, &s;ays he, any of the&s;e active per&s;ons to produce half the adventures that this twelvepeny-piece has been en|gaged in, were it po&s;&s;ible for him to give us an account of his life.</P>
<P>My friends's talk made &s;o odd an impre&s;&s;ion upon my
<PB N="210" REF="213">
mind, that &s;oon after I was a-bed I fell into a mo&s;t un|accountable re&s;verie, that had neither moral nor de&s;ign in it, and cannot be &s;o properly called a dream as a de|lirium.</P>
<P>Methoughts the &s;hilling that lay upon the table rear|ed it&s;elf upon its edge, and turning the face towards me, opened its mouth, and in a &s;oft &s;ilver &s;ound gave me the following account of his life and adventures:</P>
<P>I was born, &s;ays he, on the fide of a mountain, near a little village of Peru, and made a voyage to England in an ingot, under the convoy of Sir Francis Drake. I was, &s;oon after my arrival, taken out of my Indian habit, re|&s;ined, naturalized, and put into the Briti&s;h mode, with the face of queen Elizabeth on one fide, and the arms of the country on the other. Being thus equipped, I found in me a wonderful inclination to ramble, and vi&s;it all the parts of the new world into which I was brought. The people very much favoured my natural di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;hifted me &s;o fa&s;t from hand to hand, that before I was five years old, I had travelled into almo&s;t every corner of the nation. But in the beginning of my &s;ixth year, to my un&s;peakable grief, I fell into the hands of a mi&s;e|rable old fellow, who clapped me into an iron che&s;t, where I found five hundred more of my own quality who lay under the &s;ame con&s;inement. The only relief we had, was to be taken out and counted over in the fre&s;h air e|very morning and evening. After an impri&s;onment of &s;everal years, we heard &s;ome body knocking at our che&s;t, and breaking it open with an hammer. This we found was the old man's heir, who, as his father lay a dying, was &s;o good as to come to our relea&s;e: he &s;eparated us that very day. What was the fate of my companions I know not: as for my&s;elf, I was &s;ent to the apothecary's &s;hop for a pint of &s;ack. The apothecary gave me to an herb-woman, the herb-woman to a butcher, the butcher to a brewer, and the brewer to his wife, who made a pre|&s;ent of me to a nonconformi&s;t preacher. After this man|ner I made my way merrily through the world; for, as
<PB N="211" REF="214">
I told you before, we &s;hillings love nothing &s;o much as travelling. I &s;ometimes fetched in a &s;houlder of mutton, &s;ometimes a play-book, and often had the &s;atisfaction to treat a Templer at the twelve-peny ordinary, or carry him with three friends to We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this plea&s;ant progre&s;s which I made from place to place, I was arre&s;ted by a &s;uper&s;titious old woman, who &s;hut me up in a greazy pur&s;e, in pur&s;uance of a fooli&s;h &s;aying, That while &s;he kept a queen Eliza|beth's &s;hilling about her, &s;he &s;hould never be without mo|ney. I continued here a clo&s;e pri&s;oner for many months, till at la&s;t I was exchanged for eight and forty farthings.</P>
<P>I thus rambled from pocket to pocket till the begin|ning of the civil wars, when, to my &s;hame be it &s;poken, I was employed in rai&s;ing &s;oldiers again&s;t the king: for being of a very tempting breadth, a &s;ergeant made u&s;e of me to inveigle country fellows, and li&s;t them in the &s;er|vice of the parliament.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had made one man &s;ure, his way was to oblige him to take a &s;hilling of a more homely figure, and then practi&s;e the &s;ame trick upon another. Thus I continued doing great mi&s;chief to the crown, till my of|ficer, chancing one morning to walk abroad earlier than ordinary, &s;acrificed me to his plea&s;ures, and made u&s;e of me to &s;educe a milk-maid. This wench bent me, and gave me to her &s;weet-heart, applying more properly than &s;he intended the u&s;ual form of, <HI>To my love and from my love.</HI> This ungenerous gallant, marrying her within few days after, pawned me for a dram of brandy, and drink|ing me out next day, I was beaten flat with an hammer, and again &s;et a running.</P>
<P>After many adventures, which it would be tedious to relate, I was &s;ent to a young &s;pendthrift, in company with the will of his decea&s;ed father. The young fellow, who I found was very extravagant, gave great demon&s;trations of joy at the receiving of the will: but opening it, he found him&s;elf di&s;inherited and cut off from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fair e&s;tate, by virtue of my being made a pre&s;ent to
<PB N="212" REF="215">
him. This put him into &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion, that after hav|ing taken me in his hand, and cur&s;ed me, he &s;quirred me away from him as far as he could fling me. I chanced to light in an unfrequented place under a dead wall, where I lay undi&s;covered and u&s;ele&s;s, during the u&s;urpation of Oliver Cromwell.</P>
<P>About a year after the king's return, a poor cavalier, that was walking there about dinner-time, fortunately ca&s;t his eye upon me, and, to the great joy of us both, car|ried me to a cook's &s;hop, where he dined upon me, and drank the king's health. When I came again into the world, I found that I had been happier in my retirement than I thought, having probably by that means e&s;caped wearing a mon&s;trous pair of breeches.</P>
<P>Being now of great credit and antiquity, I was rather looked upon as a medal than an ordinary coin; for which rea&s;on a game&s;ter laid hold of me, and converted me to a counter, having got together &s;ome dozens of us for that u&s;e. We led a melancholy life in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, be|ing bu&s;y at tho&s;e hours wherein current coin is at re&s;t, and partaking the fate of our ma&s;ter, being in a few mo|ments valued at a crown, a pound, or a &s;ixpence, accord|ing to the &s;ituation in which the fortune of the cards placed us. I had at length the good luck to &s;ee my ma|&s;ter break, by which means I was again &s;ent abroad un|der my primitive denomination of a &s;hilling.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s over many other accidents of le&s;s moment, and ha&s;ten to that fatal cata&s;trophe when I fell into the hands of an arti&s;t who conveyed me under ground, and with an unmerciful pair of &s;heers cut off my titles, clip|ped my brims, retrenched my &s;hape, rubbed me to my in|mo&s;t ring, and, in &s;hort, &s;o &s;poiled and pillaged me, that he did not leave me worth a groat. You may think what a confu&s;ion I was in to &s;ee my&s;elf thus curtailed and dis|figured. I &s;hould have been a&s;hamed to have &s;hewn my head, had not all my old acquaintance been reduced to the &s;ame &s;hameful figure, excepting &s;ome few that were punched through the belly. In the mid&s;t of this gene|ral
<PB N="213" REF="216">
calamity, when every body thought our misfortune irretrievable, and our ca&s;e de&s;perate, we were thrown in|to the furnace together, and (as it often happens with cities ri&s;ing out of a fire) appeared with greater beauty and lu&s;tre than we could ever boa&s;t of before. What has happened to me &s;ince this change of &s;ex which you now &s;ee, I &s;hall take &s;ome other opportunity to relate. In the mean time I &s;hall only repeat two adventures, as being very extraordinary, and neither of them having ever hap|pened to me above once in my life. The fir&s;t was, my being in a poet's pocket, who was &s;o taken with the bright|ne&s;s and novelty of my appearance, that it gave occa&s;ion to the fine&s;t burle&s;que poem in the Briti&s;h language, en|titled from me, The &s;plendid Shilling. The &s;econd ad|venture, which I mu&s;t not omit, happened to me in the year 1703, when I was given away in charity to a blind man; but indeed this was by a mi&s;take, the per&s;on who gave me having heedle&s;ly thrown me into the hat among a penyworth of farthings.</P>

<P>I LAST winter erected a court of ju&s;tice for the cor|recting of &s;everal enormities in dre&s;s and behaviour, which are not cognizable in any other courts of this realm. The vintner's ca&s;e, which I there tried, is &s;till fre&s;h in every man's memory. That of the petticoat gave al&s;o a general &s;atisfaction, not to mention the more important points of the cane and per&s;pective; in which, if I did not give judgments and decrees according to the &s;tricte&s;t rules of equity and ju&s;tice, I can &s;afely &s;ay, I acted according to the be&s;t of my under&s;tanding. But as for the proceed|ings of that court, I &s;hall refer my reader to an account
<PB N="214" REF="217">
of them, written by my &s;ecretary, which is now in the pre&s;s, and will &s;hortly be publi&s;hed under the title of, Lillie's Reports.</P>
<P>As I la&s;t year pre&s;ided over a court of ju&s;tice, it is my intention this year to &s;et my&s;elf at the head of a court of honour. There is no court of this nature any where at pre&s;ent, except in France, where, according to the be&s;t of my intelligence, it con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch only as are mar&s;hals of that kingdom. I am likewi&s;e informed, that there is not one of that honourable board at pre&s;ent who has not been driven out of the field by the duke of Marlbo|rough: but whether this be only an accidental or a ne|ce&s;&s;ary qualification, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am not able to de|termine.</P>
<P>As for the court of honour of which I am here &s;peak|ing, I intend to &s;it my&s;elf in it as pre&s;ident, with &s;everal men of honour on my right hand, and women of virtue on my left, as my a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The fir&s;t place of the bench I have given to an old Tangereen captain with a wooden leg. The &s;econd is a gentleman of a long twi&s;ted periwig without a curl in it, a muff with very little hair upon it, and a thread-bare coat with new buttons, being a per&s;on of great worth, and &s;econd brother to a man of quality. The third is a gentleman u&s;her, extremely well read in ro|mances, and grand&s;on to one of the greate&s;t wits in Ger|many, who was &s;ome time ma&s;ter of the ceremonies to the duke of Wolfembuttel.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e who &s;it further on my right hand, as it is u&s;ual in public courts, they are &s;uch as will fill up the number of faces upon the bench, and &s;erve rather, for or|nament than u&s;e.</P>
<P>The chief upon my left hand are, an old maiden lady, that pre&s;erves &s;ome of the be&s;t blood of England in her veins.</P>
<P>A Wel&s;h woman of a little &s;tature, but high &s;pirit.</P>
<P>An old prude that has cen&s;ured every marriage for the&s;e thirty years, and is lately wedded to a young rake.</P>

with the hor&s;e-guards, and the veterans of Chel&s;ea-College; the former to furni&s;h me with twelve men of honour as often as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion for a grand jury, and the latter with as many good men and true for a petty jury.</P>
<P>As for the women of virtue, it will not be difficult for me to find them about mid-night at crimp and ba&s;|&s;et.</P>
<P>Having given this public notice of my court, I mu&s;t further add, that I intend to open it on this day &s;even|night, being Monday the twentieth in&s;tant; and do here|by invite all &s;uch as have &s;uffered injuries and affronts, that are not to be redre&s;&s;ed by the common laws of this land, whether they be &s;hort bows, cold &s;alutations, &s;u|percilious looks, unreturned &s;miles, di&s;tant behaviour, or forced familiarity; as al&s;o all &s;uch as have been aggrieved by any ambiguous expre&s;&s;ion, accidental ju&s;tle, or unkind repartee; likewi&s;e all &s;uch as have been defrauded of their right to the wall, tricked out of the upper end of the table, or have been &s;uffered to place them&s;elves in their own wrong on the back-&s;eat of the coach: The&s;e, and all of the&s;e, I do, as is above-&s;aid, invite to bring in their &s;everal ca&s;es and complaints, in which they &s;hall be relieved with all imaginable expedition.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible, that the office I have now taken up|on me will engage me in the di&s;qui&s;ition of many weigh|ty points that daily perplex the youth of the Briti&s;h na|tion, and therefore I have already di&s;cu&s;&s;ed &s;everal of them for my future u&s;e; as, How far a man may brandi&s;h his cane in the telling a &s;tory, without in&s;ulting his hearer? What degree of contradiction amounts to the lie? How a man &s;hould re&s;ent another's &s;taring and cocking a hat in his face? If a&s;king pardon is an atonement for tread|ing upon one's toes? Whether a man may put up a box on the ear received from a &s;tranger in the dark? Or, Whether a man of honour may take a blow of his wife? with &s;everal other &s;ubtilties of the like nature.</P>
<P>For my direction in the duties of my office, I have fur|ni&s;hed
<PB N="216" REF="219">
my&s;elf with a certain a&s;trological pair of &s;cales which I have contrived for this purpo&s;e. In one of them I lay the injuries, in the other the reparations. The fir&s;t are repre&s;ented by little weights made of a metal re&s;embling iron, and the other in gold. The&s;e are not only lighter than the weights made u&s;e of in averdupois, but al&s;o than &s;uch as are u&s;ed in troy-weight. The heavie&s;t of tho&s;e that repre&s;ent the injuries, amount to but a &s;cruple; and decrea&s;e by &s;o many &s;ub-divi&s;ions, that there are &s;everal imperceptible weights which cannot be &s;een without the help of a very fine micro&s;cope. I might acquaint my reader, that the&s;e &s;cales were made under the influence of the &s;un when he was in libra, and de&s;cribe many &s;igna|tures on the weights both of injury and reparation: but as this would look rather to proceed from an o&s;tentation of my own art than any care for the public, I &s;hall pa&s;s it over in &s;ilence.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Die Lunae vice&s;imo Novembris, hora nona Antemeridiana.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE court being &s;ate, an oath prepared by the cen|&s;or was admini&s;tered to the a&s;&s;i&s;tants on his right hand, who were all &s;worn upon their honour. The women on his left hand took the &s;ame oath upon their reputation. Twelve gentlemen of the hor&s;e-guards were impannelled, having unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en Mr. Alexander Truncheon, who is their right-hand man in the troop, for their fore|man in the jury. Mr. Truncheon immediately drew his &s;word, and holding it with the point towards his own body, pre&s;ented it to the cen&s;or. Mr. Bicker&s;taffe receiv|ed
<PB N="217" REF="220">
it, and after having &s;urveyed the breadth of the blade, and &s;harpne&s;s of the point, with more than ordinary at|tention, returned it to the foreman in a very graceful manner. The re&s;t of the jury, upon the delivery of the &s;word to their foreman, drew all of them together as one man, and &s;aluted the bench with &s;uch an air, as &s;ignified the mo&s;t re&s;igned &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e who commanded them, and the greate&s;t magnanimity to execute what they &s;hould command.</P>
<P>Mr. Bicker&s;taffe, after having received the compliments on his right-hand, ca&s;t his eye upon the left, where the whole female jury paid their re&s;pects by a low curt&s;ie, and by laying their hands upon their mouths. Their fore|woman was a profe&s;&s;ed Platoni&s;t, that had &s;pent much of her time in exhorting the &s;ex to &s;et a ju&s;t value upon their per&s;ons, and to make the men know them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There followed a profound &s;ilence, when at length, af|ter &s;ome recollection, the cen&s;or, who continued hither|to uncovered, put on his hat with great dignity; and af|ter having compo&s;ed the brims of it in a manner &s;uitable to the gravity of his character, he gave the following charge, which was received with &s;ilence and attention, that being the only applau&s;e which he admits of, or is ever given in his pre&s;ence.</P>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>The nature of my office, and the &s;olemnity of this occa&s;ion, requiring that I &s;hould open my fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, I &s;hall ca&s;t what I have to &s;ay under two principal heads:</P>
<P>Under the fir&s;t, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how the nece&s;|&s;ity and u&s;efulne&s;s of this new erected court; and un|der the &s;econd, I &s;hall give a word of advice and in|&s;truction to every con&s;tituent part of it.</P>
<P>As for the fir&s;t, it is well ob&s;erved by Phaedrus an heathen poet,
<Q><L>Ni&s;i utile e&s;t quod facimus, fru&s;lra e&s;t gloria.</L></Q>
Which is the &s;ame, ladies, as if I &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>It would be of no reputation for me to be pre&s;ident of a court which is</HI>
<PB N="218" REF="221">
<HI>of no benefit to the public.</HI> Now the advantages that may ari&s;e to the weal public from this in&s;titution will more plainly appear if we con&s;ider what it &s;uffers for the want of it. Are not our &s;treets daily filled with wild pieces of ju&s;tice and random penalties? Are not crimes undetermined, and reparations di&s;proportioned? How often have we &s;een the lie puni&s;hed by death, and the liar him&s;elf deciding his own cau&s;e; nay, not only acting the judge, but the executioner? Have we not known a box on the ear more &s;everely accounted for than man&s;laughter? In the&s;e extrajudicial proceed|ings of mankind, an unmannerly je&s;t is frequently as capital as a premeditated murder.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t pernicious circum&s;tance in this ca&s;e is, that the man who &s;uffers the injury mu&s;t put him&s;elf upon the &s;ame foot of danger with him that gave it, before he can have his ju&s;t revenge; &s;o that the puni&s;h|ment is altogether accidental, and may fall as well up|on the innocent as the guilty. I &s;hall only mention a ca&s;e which happens frequently among the more polite nations of the world, and which I the rather mention, becau&s;e both &s;exes are concerned in it, and which there|fore you gentlemen and you ladies of the jury will the rather take notice of; I mean that great and known ca&s;e of cuckoldom. Suppo&s;ing the per&s;on who has &s;uf|fered in&s;ults in his dearer and better half; &s;uppo&s;ing, I &s;ay, this per&s;on &s;hould re&s;ent the injuries done to his tender wife; What is the reparation he may expect? Why, to be u&s;ed wor&s;e than his poor lady, run through the body, and left breathle&s;s upon the bed of honour. What then, will you on my right hand &s;ay, mu&s;t the man do that is affronted? Mu&s;t our &s;ides be elbowed, our &s;hins broken? Mu&s;t the wall, or perhaps our mi|&s;tre&s;s, be taken from us? May a man knit his forehead into a frown, to&s;s up his arm, or pi&s;h at what we &s;ay; and mu&s;t the villain live after it? Is there no redre&s;s for injured honour? Yes, gentlemen, that is the de&s;ign of the judicature we have here e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="222">
A court of con&s;cience, we very well know, was fir&s;t in&s;tituted for the determining of &s;everal points of pro|perty, that were too little and trivial for the cognizance of higher courts of ju&s;tice. In the &s;ame manner, our court of honour is appointed for the examination of &s;everal niceties and punctilios that do not pa&s;s for wrongs in the eye of our common laws. But notwith|&s;tanding no legi&s;lators of any nation have taken into con&s;ideration the&s;e little circum&s;tances, they are &s;uch as often lead to crimes big enough for their in&s;pecti|on, though they come before them too late for their re|dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I appeal to you, ladies, [<HI>Here Mr. Bicker|&s;taffe turned to his left hand</HI>] if the&s;e are not the little &s;lings and thorns in life that make it more unea&s;y than its mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial evils? Confe&s;s ingenuou&s;ly, did you never lo&s;e a morning's devotions, becau&s;e you could not offer them up from the highe&s;t place of the pew? Have you not been in pain, even at a ball, becau&s;e an|other has been taken out to dance before you? Do you love any of your friends &s;o much as tho&s;e that are below you? Or have you any favourites that walk on your right hand? You have an&s;wered me in your looks, I a&s;k no more.</P>
<P>I come now to the &s;econd part of my di&s;cour&s;e, which obliges me to addre&s;s my&s;elf in particular to the re&s;pective members of the court, in which I &s;hall be very brief.</P>
<P>As for you, gentlemen and ladies, my a&s;&s;i&s;tants and grand juries, I have made choice of you on my right hand, becau&s;e I know you very jealous of your honour; and you on my left, becau&s;e I know you very much concerned for the reputation of others; for which rea|&s;on I expect great exactne&s;s and impartiality in your verdicts and judgments.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t in the next place addre&s;s my&s;elf to you, gentle|men of the council: You all know, that I have not cho&s;en you for your knowlege in the litigious parts of
<PB N="220" REF="223">
the law, but becau&s;e you have all of you formerly fought duels, of which I have rea&s;on to think you have repent|ed, as being now &s;ettled in the peaceable &s;tate of bench|ers. My advice to you is, only that in your pleadings you are &s;hort and expre&s;&s;ive: to which end you are to bani&s;h out of your di&s;cour&s;es all &s;ynonymous terms, and unnece&s;&s;ary multiplications of verbs and nouns. I do moreover forbid you the u&s;e of the words <HI>al&s;o</HI> and <HI>like|wi&s;e;</HI> and mu&s;t further declare, that if I catch any one among you, upon any pretence what&s;oever, u&s;ing the particle <HI>or,</HI> I &s;hall ince&s;&s;antly order him to be &s;tripped of his gown, and thrown over the bar.</P>

<P>THERE are no books which I more delight in than in travels, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that de&s;cribe remote coun|tries, and give the writer an opportunity of &s;hewing his parts without incurring any danger of being examined or contradicted. Among all the authors of this kind, our re|nowned country-man Sir John Mandeville has di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf by the copiou&s;ne&s;s of his invention, and greatne&s;s of his genius. The &s;econd to Sir John I take to have been Ferdinand Mendez Pinto, a per&s;on of in|finite adventure, and unbounded imagination. One reads the voyages of the&s;e two great wits with as much a&s;to|ni&s;hment
<PB N="221" REF="224">
as the travels of Uly&s;&s;es in Homer, or of the Red-Cro&s;s knight in Spen&s;er. All is enchanted ground, and fairy land.</P>
<P>I have got into my hands by great chance &s;everal ma|nu&s;cripts of the&s;e two eminent authors, which are filled with greater wonders than any of tho&s;e they have com|municated to the public; and indeed, were they not &s;o well atte&s;ted, would appear altogether improbable. I am apt to think, the ingenious authors did not publi&s;h them with the re&s;t of their works, le&s;t they &s;hould pa&s;s for fi|ctions and fables: a caution not unnece&s;&s;ary, when the re|putation of their veracity was not yet e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world. But as this rea&s;on has now no further weight, I &s;hall make the public a pre&s;ent of the&s;e curious pieces at &s;uch times as I &s;hall find my&s;elf unprovided with other &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent paper I intend to fill with an extract of Sir John's journal, in which that learned and worthy knight gives an account of the freezing and thawing of &s;everal &s;hort &s;peeches which he made in the territories of Nova Zembla. I need not inform my reader, that the author of Hudibras alludes to this &s;trange quality in that cold climate, when, &s;peaking of ab&s;tracted notions clothed in a vi&s;ible &s;hape, he adds that apt &s;imile,
<Q><L>Like words congeal'd in northern air.</L></Q></P>
<P>Not to keep my reader any longer in &s;u&s;pence, the re|lation put into modern language is as follows:</P>
<P>We were &s;eparated by a &s;torm in the latitude of 73, in|&s;omuch that only the &s;hip which I was in; with a Dutch and a French ve&s;&s;el, got &s;afe into a creek of Nova Zembla. We landed, in order to re&s;it our ve&s;&s;els, and &s;tore our&s;elves with provi&s;ions. The crew of each ve&s;&s;el made them&s;elves a cabin of turf and wood, at &s;ome di&s;tance from each o|ther, to fence them&s;elves again&s;t the inclemencies of the weather, which was &s;evere beyond imagination. We &s;oon ob&s;erved, that in talking to one another we lo&s;t &s;everal of our words, and could not hear one another at above
<PB N="222" REF="225">
two yards di&s;tance, and that too when we &s;ate very near the fire. After much perplexity, I found that our words froze in the air before they could reach the ears of the per&s;on to whom they were &s;poken. I was &s;oon confirm|ed in this conjecture, when, upon the encrea&s;e of the cold, the whole company grew dumb or rather deaf; for every man was &s;en&s;ible, as we afterwards found, that he &s;poke as well as ever; but the &s;ounds no &s;ooner took air, than they were conden&s;ed and lo&s;t. It was now a mi&s;erable &s;pectacle to &s;ee us nodding and gaping at one another, e|very man talking, and no man heard. One might ob|&s;erve a &s;eaman, that could hail a &s;hip at a league di&s;tance, beckoning with his hands, &s;training his lungs, and tear|ing his throat, but all in vain.<Q><L>&mdash;Nee vox, nec verba, &s;equuntur.</L></Q></P>
<P>We continued here three weeks in this di&s;mal plight. At length, upon a turn of wind, the air about us began to thaw. Our cabin was immediately filled with a dry clat|tering &s;ound, which I afterwards found to be the crack|ling of con&s;onants that broke above our heads, and were often mixed with a gentle hi&s;&s;ing, which I imputed to the letter S, that occurs &s;o frequently in the Engli&s;h tongue. I &s;oon after felt a breeze of whi&s;pers ru&s;hing by my ear; for tho&s;e being of a &s;oft and gentle &s;ub&s;tance, immediate|ly liquefied in the warm wind that blew acro&s;s our cabin. The&s;e were &s;oon followed by &s;yllables and &s;hort words, and at length by entire &s;entences, that melted &s;ooner or latter, as they were more or le&s;s congealed; &s;o that we now heard every thing that had been <HI>&s;poken</HI> during the whole three weeks that we had been <HI>&s;ilent,</HI> if I may u&s;e that expre&s;&s;ion. It was now very early in the morning, and yet, to my &s;urprize, I heard &s;ome body &s;ay, <HI>Sir John, it is midnight, and time for the &s;hip's crew to go to bed.</HI> This I knew to be the pilot's voice, and upon recollect|ing my&s;elf, I concluded that he had &s;poken the&s;e words to me &s;ome days before, though I could not hear them be|fore the pre&s;ent thaw. My reader will ea&s;ily imagine how
<PB N="223" REF="226">
the whole crew was amazed, to hear every man talking, and &s;ee no man opening his mouth. In the mid&s;t of this great &s;urprize we were all in, we heard a volley of oaths and cur&s;es, la&s;ting for a long while, and uttered in a ve|ry hoar&s;e voice, which I knew belonged to the boat&s;wain, who was a very choleric fellow, and had taken his oppor|tunity of cur&s;ing and &s;wearing at me when he thought I could not hear him; for I had &s;everal times given him the &s;trapado on that account, as I did not fail to repeat it for the&s;e his pious &s;oliloquies when I got him on &s;hip|board.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit the names of &s;everal beauties in Wap|ping, which were heard every now and then, in the mid&s;t of a long &s;igh that accompanied them; as, Dear Kate! Pretty Mrs. Peggy! When &s;hall I &s;ee my Sue again? this betrayed &s;everal amours which had been concealed till that time, and furni&s;hed us with a great deal of mirth in our return to England.</P>
<P>When this confu&s;ion of voices was pretty well over, though I was afraid to offer at &s;peaking, as fearing I &s;hould not be heard, I propo&s;ed a vi&s;it to the Dutch cabin, which lay about a mile further up into the country. My crew were extremely rejoiced to find they had again recover|ed their hearing, though every man uttered his voice with the &s;ame apprehen&s;ions that I had done:<Q><L>&mdash;Et timide verba intermi&s;&s;a retentat.</L></Q></P>
<P>At about half a mile's di&s;tance from our cabin, we heard the groanings of a bear, which at fir&s;t &s;tartled us; but upon enquiry we were informed by &s;ome of our compa|ny, that he was dead, and now lay in &s;alt, having been killed upon that very &s;pot about a fortnight before, in the time of the fro&s;t. Not far from the &s;ame place we were likewi&s;e entertained with &s;ome po&s;thumous &s;narls and barkings of a fox.</P>
<P>We at length arrived at the little Dutch &s;ettlement, and upon entering the room, found it filled with &s;ighs that &s;melt of brandy, and &s;everal other unfavoury &s;ounds
<PB N="224" REF="227">
that were altogether inarticulate. My valet, who was an Iri&s;hman, fell into &s;o great a rage at what he heard, that he drew his &s;word; but not knowing where to lay the blame, he put it up again. We were &s;tunned with the&s;e confu&s;ed noi&s;es, but did not hear a &s;ingle word till about half an hour after; which I a&s;cribed to the har&s;h and ob|durate &s;ounds of that language, which wanted more time than ours to melt and become audible.</P>
<P>After having here met with a very hearty welcome, we went to the French cabin, who, to make amends for their three weeks &s;ilence, were talking and di&s;puting with great|er rapidity and confu&s;ion than ever I heard in an a&s;&s;em|bly even of that nation. Their language, as I found, up|on the fir&s;t giving of the weather, fell a&s;under and di&s;|&s;olved. I was here convinced of an error into which I had before fallen; for I fancied, that for the freezing of the &s;ound, it was nece&s;&s;ary for it to be wrapped up, and, as it were, pre&s;erved in breath; but I found my mi&s;take, when I heard the &s;ound of a kit playing a minuit over our heads. I a&s;ked the occa&s;ion of it; upon which one of the company told me, that it would play there above a week longer if the thaw continued; for, &s;ays he, find|ing our&s;elves bereft of &s;peech, we prevailed upon one of the company, who had this mu&s;ical in&s;trument about him, to play to us from morning to night; all which time we employed in dancing, in order to di&s;&s;ipate our chagrin, <HI>et tuer le temps.</HI></P>
<P>Here Sir John gives very good philo&s;ophical rea&s;ons, why the kit could be heard during the fro&s;t; but as they are &s;omething prolix, I pa&s;s over them in &s;ilence, and &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the honourable author &s;eems, by his quotations, to have been well ver&s;ed in the ancient poets, which perhaps rai&s;ed his fancy above the ordina|ry pitch of hi&s;torians, and very much contributed to the embelli&s;hment of his writings.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM at pre&s;ent under very great difficulties, which it is not in the power of any one, be&s;ides your&s;elf, to redre&s;s. Whether or no you &s;hall think it a proper ca&s;e to come before your Court of Honour, I cannot tell; but thus it is: I am chaplain to an honourable family, very regular at the hours of devotion, and I hope of an unblameable life; but for not of|fering to ri&s;e at &s;econd cour&s;e, I found my patron and his la|dy very &s;ullen and out of humour, though at fir&s;t I did not know the rea&s;on of it. At length, when I happened to help my&s;elf to a jelly, the lady of the hou&s;e, otherwi&s;e a devout woman, told me, That it did not become a man of my cloth to delight in &s;uch frivolous food: but as I &s;till continued to &s;it out the la&s;t cour&s;e, I was ye&s;terday informed by the butler, that his lord&s;hip had no further occa&s;ion for my &s;ervice.

</LETTER>
<P>The ca&s;e of this gentleman de&s;erves pity, e&s;pecially if he loves &s;weet-meats, to which, if I may gue&s;s by his letter, he is no enemy. In the mean time, I have often wondered at the indecency of di&s;carding the holie&s;t man from the table as &s;oon as the mo&s;t delicious parts of the entertainment are &s;erved up, and could never conceive a rea&s;on for &s;o ab&s;urd a cu&s;tom. Is it becau&s;e a liquori&s;h palate, or a &s;weet tooth (as they call it) is not con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;anctity of his character? This is but a trifling pretence. No man of the mo&s;t rigid virtue gives offence
<PB N="226" REF="229">
by any exce&s;&s;es in plumb-pudding or plumb-porridge, and that becau&s;e they are the fir&s;t parts of the dinner. Is there any thing that tends to incitation in &s;weetmeats more than in ordinary di&s;hes? Certainly not. Sugar-plumbs are a very innocent diet, and con&s;erves of a much colder nature than our common pickles. I have &s;ometimes thought, that the ceremony of the chaplain's flying away from the de&s;&s;ert was typical and figurative, to mark out to the company how they ought to retire from all the lu|&s;cious baits of temptation, and deny their appetites the gratifications that are mo&s;t plea&s;ing to them; or at lea&s;t to &s;ignify, that we ought to &s;tint our&s;elves in our mo&s;t lawful &s;atisfactions, and not make our plea&s;ure, but our &s;upport, the end of eating: but mo&s;t certainly, if &s;uch a le&s;&s;on of temperance had been nece&s;&s;ary at a table, our clergy would have recommended it to all the lay-ma&s;ters of families, and not have di&s;turbed other mens tables with &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable examples of ab&s;tinence. The original therefore of this barbarous cu&s;tom, I take to have been meerly accidental. The chaplain retired out of pure com|plai&s;ance to make room for the removal of the di&s;hes, or po&s;&s;ibly for the ranging of the de&s;&s;ert. This by degrees grew into a duty, till at length, as the fa&s;hion improved, the good man found him&s;elf cut off from the third part of the entertainment; and if the arrogance of the patron goes on, it is not impo&s;&s;ible but, in the next generation, he may &s;ee him&s;elf reduced to the tythe, or tenth di&s;h of the table; a &s;ufficient caution not to part with any pri|vilege we are once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. It was u&s;ual for the prie&s;t in old times to fea&s;t upon the &s;acrifice, nay the ho|ney-cake, while the hungry laity looked upon him with great devotion, or as the late lord Roche&s;ter de&s;cribes it in a lively manner,
<Q><L>And while the prie&s;t did eat, the people &s;tared.</L></Q></P>
<P>At pre&s;ent the cu&s;tom is inverted; the laity fea&s;t, while the prie&s;t &s;tands by as an humble &s;pectator. This nece&s;|&s;arily puts the good man upon making great ravages upon
<PB N="227" REF="230">
all the di&s;hes that &s;tand near him, and di&s;tingui&s;hing him|&s;elf by voraciou&s;ne&s;s of appetite, as knowing that his time is &s;hort. I would fain a&s;k the&s;e &s;tiffnecked patrons, whe|ther they would not take it ill of a chaplain that, in his grace after meat, &s;hould return thanks for the whole en|tertainment, with an exception to the de&s;&s;ert? And yet I cannot but think, that in &s;uch a proceeding he would but deal with them as they de&s;erved. What would a Ro|man catholic prie&s;t think, who is always helped fir&s;t, and placed next the ladies, &s;hould he &s;ee a clergyman giving his company the &s;lip at the fir&s;t appearance of the tarts or &s;weet-meats? Would not he believe that he had the &s;ame antipathy to a candied orange, or a piece of puff|pa&s;te, as &s;ome have to a Che&s;hire chee&s;e, or a brea&s;t of mutton? Yet to &s;o ridiculous a height is this fooli&s;h cu|&s;tom grown, that even the Chri&s;tmas pye, which in its very nature is a kind of con&s;ecrated cate, and a badge of di&s;tinction, is often forbidden to the druid of the fami|ly. Strange! that a &s;irloin of beef, whether boiled or roa&s;t|ed, when entire, is expo&s;ed to his utmo&s;t depredations and inci&s;ions; but if minced into &s;mall pieces, and to&s;|&s;ed up with plumbs and &s;ugar, changes its property, and &s;or&s;ooth, is meat for his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e I know not which to cen&s;ure, the patron or the chaplain, the in&s;olence of power, or the abjectne&s;s of dependence. For my own part, I have often blu&s;hed to &s;ee a gentleman, whom I knew to have much more wit and learning than my&s;elf, and who was bred up with me at the univer&s;ity upon the &s;ame foot of a liberal edu|cation, treated in &s;uch an ignominious manner, and &s;unk beneath tho&s;e of his own rank, by rea&s;on of that chara|cter which ought to bring him honour. This deters men of generous minds from placing them&s;elves in &s;uch a &s;ta|tion of life, and by that means frequently excludes per|&s;ons of quality from the improving and agreeable con|ver&s;ation of a learned and ob&s;equious friend.</P>
<P>Mr. Oldham lets us know, that he was affrighted from
<PB N="228" REF="231">
the thought of &s;uch an employment, by the &s;candalous &s;ort of treatment which often accompanies it.<Q><L>Some think them&s;elves exalted to the sky,</L>
<L>If they light in &s;ome noble family:</L>
<L>Diet, a hor&s;e, and thirty pounds a year,</L>
<L>Be&s;ides th' advantage of his lord&s;hip's ear,</L>
<L>The credit of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and the &s;tate,</L>
<L>Are things that in a young&s;ter's &s;en&s;e &s;ound great.</L>
<L>Little the unexperienc'd wretch does know,</L>
<L>What &s;lavery he oft mu&s;t undergo:</L>
<L>Who tho' in &s;ilken &s;carf, and ca&s;&s;oc dre&s;t,</L>
<L>Wears but a gayer livery at be&s;t.</L>
<L>When dinner calls, the implement mu&s;t wait</L>
<L>With holy words to con&s;ecrate the meat.</L>
<L>But hold it for a favour &s;eldom known,</L>
<L>If he be deign'd the honour to &s;it down.</L>
<L>Soon as the tarts appear, Sir Crape withdraw,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e danties are not for a &s;piritual maw.</L>
<L>Ob&s;erve your di&s;tance, and be &s;ure to &s;tand</L>
<L>Hard by the ci&s;tern with your cap in hand:</L>
<L>There for diver&s;ion you may pick your teeth,</L>
<L>Till the kind voider comes for your relief.</L>
<L>Let others who &s;uch meanne&s;&s;es can brook,</L>
<L>Strike countenance to ev'ry great man's look;</L>
<L>I rate my freedom higher.</L></Q></P>
<P>This author's raillery is the raillery of a friend, and does not turn the &s;acred order into ridicule, but is a ju&s;t cen&s;ure on &s;uch per&s;ons as take advantage from the nece&s;&s;ities of a man of merit, to impo&s;e on him hard|&s;hips that are by no means &s;uitable to the dignity of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The proceedings of the Court of Honour, held in Sheer-lane on Monday the 20th of November 1710, before I&s;aac Bicker&s;taffe <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> cen&s;or of Great Britain.</HEAD>
<P>PETER PLUMB, of London, merchant, was in|dicted by the honourable Mr. Thomas Gules of Gule-hall in the county of Salop, for that the &s;aid Pe|ter Plumb did in Lombard-&s;treet, London, between the hours of two and three in the afternoon, meet the &s;aid Mr. Thomas Gules, and after a &s;hort &s;alutation, put on his hat, value fivepence, while the honourable Mr. Gules &s;tood bareheaded for the &s;pace of two &s;econds. It was further urged again&s;t the criminal, that during his di&s;|cour&s;e with the pro&s;ecutor, he feloniou&s;ly &s;tole the wall of him, having clapped his back again&s;t it in &s;uch a man|ner that it was impo&s;&s;ible for Mr. Gules to recover it a|gain at his taking leave of him. The pro&s;ecutor al|leged, that he was the cadet of a very ancient family, and that according to the principles of all the younger brothers of the &s;aid family, he had never &s;ullied him&s;elf with bu&s;ine&s;s, but had cho&s;en rather to &s;tarve like a man of honour, than do any thing beneath his quality. He produced &s;everal witne&s;&s;es, that he had never employed him&s;elf beyond the twi&s;ting of a whip, or the making of a pair of nut-crackers, in which he only worked for his diver&s;ion, in order to make a pre&s;ent now and then to his friends. The pri&s;oner being a&s;ked what he could &s;ay for him&s;elf, ca&s;t &s;everal reflections upon the honour|able Mr. Gules; as, that he was not worth a groat; that no body in the city would tru&s;t him for a halfpenny; that he owed him money which he had promi&s;ed to pay him &s;everal times, but never kept his word: and in &s;hort, that he was an idle, beggarly fellow, and of no u&s;e to the
<PB N="230" REF="233">
public. This &s;ort of language was very &s;everely repri|manded by the cen&s;or, who told the criminal, that he &s;poke in contempt of the court, and that he &s;hould be proceeded again&s;t for contumacy, if he did not change his &s;tyle. The pri&s;oner therefore de&s;ired to be heard by his council, who urged in his defence, that he put on his hat through ignorance, and took the wall by accident. They likewi&s;e produced &s;everal witne&s;&s;es, that he made &s;everal motions with his hat in his hand, which are generally under&s;tood as an invitation to the per&s;on we talk with to be covered; and that the gentleman not taking the hint, he was forced to put on his hat, as being troubled with a cold. There was likewi&s;e an Iri&s;hman who de|po&s;ed, that he had heard him cough three and twenty times that morning. And as for the wall, it was alleged, that he had taken it inadvertently, to &s;ave him&s;elf from a &s;hower of rain which was then falling. The cen&s;or hav|ing con&s;ulted the men of honour who &s;ate at his right hand on the bench, found they were of opinion, that the defence made by the pri&s;oner's council did rather aggra|vate than extenuate his crime; that the motions and in|timations of the hat were a token of &s;uperiority in con|ver&s;ation, and therefore not to be u&s;ed by the criminal to a man of the pro&s;ecutor's quality, who was likewi&s;e ve&s;ted with a double title to the wall at the time of their conver&s;ation, both as it was the upper hand, and as it was a &s;helter from the weather. The evidence being ve|ry full and clear, the jury, without going out of the court, declared their opinion unanimou&s;ly by the mouth of their foreman, that the pro&s;ecutor was bound in honour to make the &s;un &s;hine through the criminal, or, as they af|terwards explained them&s;elves, to whip him through the lungs.</P>
<P>The cen&s;or knitting his brows into a frown, and look|ing very &s;ternly upon the jury, after a little pau&s;e, gave them to know, that this court was erected for the find|ing out of penalties &s;uitable to offences, and to re&s;train the outrages of private ju&s;tice; and that he expected they
<PB N="231" REF="234">
&s;hould moderate their verdict. The jury therefore re|tired, and being willing to comply with the advices of the cen&s;or, after an hour's con&s;ultation, declared their opi|nion as follows:</P>
<P>That in con&s;ideration this was Peter Plumb's fir&s;t of|fence, and that there did not appear any <HI>malice propen&s;e</HI> in it, as al&s;o that he lived in good reputation among his neighbours, and that his taking the wall was only <HI>&s;e de|fendendo,</HI> the pro&s;ecutor &s;hould let him e&s;cape with life, and content him&s;elf with the &s;litting of his no&s;e, and the cutting off both his ears. Mr. Bicker&s;taffe &s;miling upon the court, told them, that he thought the puni&s;hment, even under its pre&s;ent mitigation, too &s;evere; and that &s;uch penalties might be of ill con&s;equence in a trading nation. He therefore pronounced &s;entence again&s;t the criminal, in the following manner: That his hat, which was the in&s;trument of offence, &s;hould be forfeited to the court; that the criminal &s;hould go to the warehou&s;e from whence he came, and thence, as occa&s;ion &s;hould require, proceed to the Exchange, or Garraway's coffee-hou&s;e, in what manner he plea&s;ed; but that neither he nor any of the family of the Plumbs &s;hould hereafter appear in the &s;treets of London out of their coaches, that &s;o the foot-way might be left open and undi&s;turbed for their betters.</P>
<P>Dathan, a peddling Jew, and T. R&mdash;, a Wel&s;h|man, were indicted by the keeper of an ale-hou&s;e in We&s;t|min&s;ter, for breaking the peace and two earthen mugs, in a di&s;pute about the antiquity of their families, to the great detriment of the hou&s;e, and di&s;turbance of the whole neighbourhood. Dathan &s;aid for him&s;elf, that he was provoked to it by the Wel&s;hman, who pretended, that the Wel&s;h were an ancienter people than the Jews; where|as, &s;ays he, I can &s;hew by this genealogy in my hand, that I am the &s;on of Me&s;heck, that was the &s;on of Naboth, that was the &s;on of Shalem, that was the &s;on of&mdash;The Wel&s;hman here interrupted him, and told him, that he could produce &s;hennalogy as well as him&s;elf; for that he was John ap Rice, ap Shenkin, ap Shones. He then
<PB N="232" REF="235">
turned him&s;elf to the cen&s;or, and told him in the &s;ame broken accent, and with much warmth, that the Jew would needs uphold, that king Cadwallader was younger than I&s;&s;achar. Mr. Bicker&s;taffe &s;eemed very much inclined to give &s;entence again&s;t Dathan, as being a Jew, but find|ing rea&s;ons, by &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions which the Wel&s;hman let fall in a&s;&s;erting the antiquity of his family, to &s;u&s;pect that the &s;aid Wel&s;hman was a Prae-Adamite, he &s;uffered the jury to go out, without any previous admonition. Af|ter &s;ome time they returned, and gave their verdict, that it appearing the per&s;ons at the bar did neither of them wear a &s;word, and that con&s;equently they had no right to quarrel upon a point of honour; to prevent &s;uch frivolous appeals for the future, they &s;hould both of them be to&s;|&s;ed in the &s;ame blanket, and there adju&s;t the &s;uperiority as they could agree it between them&s;elves. The cen&s;or confirmed the verdict.</P>
<P>Richard Newman was indicted by major Punto, for having u&s;ed the words, <HI>Perhaps it may be &s;o,</HI> in a di&s;pute with the &s;aid major. The major urged, that the word, <HI>perhaps,</HI> was que&s;tioning his veracity, and that it was an indirect manner of giving him the lie. Richard Newman had nothing more to &s;ay for him&s;elf, than that he intend|ed no &s;uch thing, and threw him&s;elf upon the mercy of the court. The jury brought in their verdict &s;pecial.</P>
<P>Mr. Bicker&s;taffe &s;tood up, and after having ca&s;t his eyes over the whole a&s;&s;embly, hemmed thrice. He then acquainted them, that he had laid down a rule to him&s;elf, which he was re&s;olved never to depart from, and which, as he conceived, would very much conduce to the &s;hort|ening the bu&s;ine&s;s of the court; I mean, &s;ays he, never to allow of the lie being given by con&s;truction, implica|tion, or induction, but by the &s;ole u&s;e of the word it&s;elf. He then proceeded to &s;hew the great mi&s;chiefs that had ari&s;en to the Engli&s;h nation from that pernicious mono|&s;yllable; that it had bred the mo&s;t fatal quarrels between the deare&s;t friends; that it had frequently thinned the guards, and made great havoc in the army; that it had
<PB N="233" REF="236">
&s;ometimes weakened the city trained-bands; and, in a word, had de&s;troyed many of the brave&s;t men in the i&s;le of Great Britain. For the prevention of which evils for the future, he in&s;tructed the jury to <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> the word it&s;elf as a nui&s;ance in the Engli&s;h tongue; and further promi&s;ed them, that he would, upon &s;uch their pre&s;entment, pub|li&s;h an edict of the court for the entire bani&s;hment and exclu&s;ion of it out of the di&s;cour&s;es and conver&s;ation of all civil &s;ocieties.</P>

<P>EVERY nation is di&s;tingui&s;hed by productions that are peculiar to it. Great Britain is particularly fruit|ful in religions, that &s;hoot up and flouri&s;h in this climate more than in any other. We are &s;o famous abroad for our great variety of &s;ects and opinions, that an ingenious friend of mine, who is lately returned from his travels, a&s;&s;ures me, there is a &s;how at this time <HI>carried</HI> up and down in Germany, which repre&s;ents all the religions in Great Britain in wax-work. Notwith&s;tanding that the pliancy of the matter in which the images are wrought
<PB N="234" REF="237">
makes it capable of being moulded into all &s;hapes and fi|gures, my friend tells me, that he did not think it po&s;|&s;ible for it to be twi&s;ted and tortured into &s;o many &s;krew|ed faces and wry features as appeared in &s;everal of the fi|gures that compo&s;ed the &s;how. I was indeed &s;o plea&s;ed with the de&s;ign of the German arti&s;t, that I begged my friend to give me an account of it in all its particulars, which he did after the following manner:</P>
<P>I have often, &s;ays he, been pre&s;ent at a &s;how of ele|phants, camels, dromedaries, and other &s;trange creatures, but I never &s;aw &s;o great an a&s;&s;embly of &s;pectators as were met together at the opening of this great piece of wax|work. We were all placed in a large hall, according to the price that we had paid for our &s;eats: the curtain that hung before the &s;how was made by a ma&s;ter of tape&s;try, who had woven it in the figure of a mon&s;trous Hydra that had &s;everal heads, which brandi&s;hed out their tongues, and &s;eemed to hi&s;s at each other. Some of the&s;e heads were large and entire; and where any of them had been lopped away, there &s;prouted up &s;everal in the room of them; in&s;omuch that for one head cut off, a man might &s;ee ten, twenty, or an hundred of a &s;maller &s;ize, creeping through the wound. In &s;hort, the whole picture was no|thing but confu&s;ion and blood&s;hed. On a &s;udden, &s;ays my friend, I was &s;tartled with a flouri&s;h of many mu&s;ical in&s;truments that I had never heard before, which was fol|lowed by a &s;hort tune (if it might be &s;o called) wholly made up of jars and di&s;cords. Among the re&s;t, there was an organ, a bag-pipe, a groaning-board, a Stentoropho|nic trumpet, with &s;everal wind-in&s;truments of a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;ound, which I do not &s;o much as know the names of. After a &s;hort flouri&s;h, the curtain was drawn up, and we were pre&s;ented with the mo&s;t extraordinary a&s;&s;embly of figures that ever entered into a man's ima|gination. The de&s;ign of the workman was &s;o well ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the dumb thow before us, that it was not hard for an Engli&s;hman to comprehend the meaning of it.</P>
<P>The principal figures were placed in a row, con&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="235" REF="238">
of &s;even per&s;ons. The middle figure, which immediate|ly attracted the eyes of the whole company, and was much bigger than the re&s;t, was formed like a matron, dre&s;&s;ed in the habit of an elderly woman of quality in queen E|li&s;abeth's days. The mo&s;t remarkable parts of her dre&s;s, was the beaver with the &s;teeple crown, the &s;carf that was darker than &s;able, and the lawn apron that was whiter than ermin. Her gown was of the riche&s;t black velvet, and ju&s;t upon her heart &s;tudded with large diamonds of an ine&s;timable value, di&s;po&s;ed in the form of a cro&s;s. She bore an inexpre&s;&s;ible chearfulne&s;s and dignity in her a&s;|pect; and though &s;he &s;eemed in years, appeared with &s;o much &s;pirit and vivacity, as gave her at the &s;ame time an air of old age and immortality. I found my heart touch|ed with &s;o much love and reverence at the &s;ight of her, that the tears ran down my face as I looked upon her; and &s;till the more I looked upon her, the more my heart was melted with the &s;entiments of filial tenderne&s;s and duty. I di&s;covered every moment &s;omething &s;o charm|ing in this figure, that I could &s;carce take my eyes off it. On its right hand there &s;ate the figure of a woman &s;o co|vered with ornaments, that her face, her body, and her hands, were almo&s;t entirely hid under them. The little you could &s;ee of her face was painted; and what I thought very odd, had &s;omething in it like artificial wrinkles; but I was the le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed at it, when I &s;aw upon her fore|head an old fa&s;hioned tower of grey hairs. Her head|dre&s;s ro&s;e very high by three &s;everal &s;tories or degrees; her garments had a thou&s;and colours in them, and were embroidered with cro&s;&s;es in gold, &s;ilver and &s;ilk: &s;he had nothing on, &s;o much as a glove or a &s;lipper, which was not marked with this figure; nay, &s;o &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly fond did &s;he appear of it, that &s;he &s;ate cro&s;s-legged. I was quickly &s;ick of this tawdry compo&s;ition of ribands, &s;ilks and jewels, and therefore ca&s;t my eye on a dame which was ju&s;t the rever&s;e of it. I need not tell my reader, that the lady before de&s;cribed was Popery, or that &s;he I am going to de&s;cribe is Pre&s;bytery. She &s;ate on the left
<PB N="236" REF="239">
hand of the venerable matron, and &s;o much re&s;embled her in the features of her countenance, that &s;he &s;eemed her &s;i&s;ter; but at the &s;ame time that one ob&s;erved a likene&s;s in her beauty, one could not but take notice, that there was &s;omething in it &s;ickly and &s;plenetic. Her face had e|nough to di&s;cover the relation, but it was drawn up into a peevi&s;h figure, &s;oured with di&s;content, and overca&s;t with melancholy. She &s;eemed offended at the matron for the &s;hape of her hat, as too much re&s;embling the triple coronet of the per&s;on who &s;ate by her. One might &s;ee likewi&s;e, that &s;he di&s;&s;ented from the white apron and the cro&s;s; for which rea&s;on &s;he had made her&s;elf a plain home|ly dowdy, and turned her face towards the &s;ectaries that &s;ate on the left hand, as being afraid of looking upon the matron, left &s;he &s;hould &s;ee the harlot by her.</P>
<P>On the right hand of Popery &s;ate Judai&s;m, repre&s;ent|ed by an old man embroidered with phylacteries, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by many typical figures, which I had not &s;kill enough to unriddle. He was placed among the rub|bi&s;h of a temple; but in&s;tead of weeping over it, (which I &s;hould have expected from him) he was counting out a bag of money upon the ruins of it.</P>
<P>On his right hand was Dei&s;m, or Natural Religion. This was a figure of an half-naked aukward country wench, who with proper ornaments and education would have made an agreeable and beautiful appearance; but for want of tho&s;e advantages, was &s;uch a &s;pectacle as a man would blu&s;h to look upon.</P>
<P>I have now, continued my friend, given you an ac|count of tho&s;e who were placed on the right hand of the matron, and who, according to the order in which they &s;ate, were Dei&s;m, Judai&s;m, and Popery On the left hand, as I told you, appeared Pre&s;bytery. The next to her was a figure which &s;omewhat puzzled me: It was that of a man looking, with horror in his eyes, upon a &s;ilver ba|&s;on filled with water. Ob&s;erving &s;omething in his coun|tenance that looked like lunacy, I fancied at fir&s;t that he was to expre&s;s that kind of di&s;traction which the phy&s;i|cians
<PB N="237" REF="240">
call the hydro-phobia; but con&s;idering what the intention of the &s;how was, I immediately recollected my|&s;elf, and concluded it to be Anabapti&s;m.</P>
<P>The next figure was a man that &s;ate under a mo&s;t profound compo&s;ure of mind: he wore an hat who&s;e brims were exactly parallel with the horizon: his gar|ment had neither &s;leeve nor &s;kirt, nor &s;o much as a &s;u|perfluous button. What he called his cravat, was a lit|tle piece of white linnen quilled with great exactne&s;s, and hanging below his chin about two inches. Seeing a book in his hand, I a&s;ked our arti&s;t what it was, who told me it was the Quakers religion; upon which I de|&s;ired a &s;ight of it. Upon peru&s;al, I found it to be no|thing but a new-fa&s;hioned grammar, or an art of abridg|ing ordinary di&s;cour&s;e. The nouns were reduced to a very &s;mall number, as the <HI>light, friend, Babylon.</HI> The principal of his pronouns was <HI>thou,</HI> and as for <HI>you, ye,</HI> and <HI>yours,</HI> I found they were not looked upon as parts of &s;peech in this grammar. All the verbs wanted the &s;econd per&s;on plural; the participles ending all in <HI>ing</HI> or <HI>ed,</HI> which were marked with a particular accent. There were no adverbs be&s;ides <HI>yea</HI> and <HI>nay.</HI> The &s;ame thrift was ob&s;erved in the prepo&s;itions. The conjunctions were only <HI>hem!</HI> and <HI>ha!</HI> and the interjections brought under the three heads of &s;ighing, &s;obbing, and groaning. There was at the end of the grammar a little nomencla|ture, called, <HI>the Chri&s;tian man's vocabulary,</HI> which gave new appellations, or (if you will) Chri&s;tian names to al|mo&s;t every thing in life. I replaced the book in the hand of the figure, not without admiring the &s;implicity of its garb, &s;peech and behaviour.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to this row of religions, there was a &s;tatue dre&s;&s;ed in a fool's coat, with a cap of bells upon his head, laughing and pointing at the figures that &s;tood before him. This ideot is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ay in his heart what David's fool did &s;ome thou&s;ands of years ago, and was therefore de&s;igned as a proper repre&s;entative of tho&s;e
<PB N="238" REF="241">
among us who are called Athei&s;ts and Infidels by others, and Free-thinkers by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There were many other groupes of figures which I did not know the meaning of; but &s;eeing a collection of both &s;exes turning their backs upon the company, and laying their heads very clo&s;e together, I enquired after their religion, and found that they called them&s;elves the Philadelphians, or the family of love.</P>
<P>In the oppo&s;ite corner there &s;ate another little con|gregation of &s;trange figures, opening their mouths as wide as they could gape, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of the <HI>&s;weet &s;ingers of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit, that in this a&s;&s;embly of wax there were &s;everal pieces that moved by clock-work, and gave great &s;atisfaction to the &s;pectators. Behind the matron there &s;tood one of the&s;e figures, and behind Popery ano|ther, which, as the arti&s;t told us, were each of them the genius of the per&s;on they attended. That behind Po|pery repre&s;ented Per&s;ecution, and the other Moderation. The fir&s;t of the&s;e moved by &s;ecret &s;prings towards a great heap of dead bodies that lay piled upon one another at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance behind the principal figures. There were written on the foreheads of the&s;e dead men &s;everal hard words, as Prae-Adamites, Sabbatarians, Ca|meronians, Muggletonians, Browni&s;ts, Independents, Ma&s;onites, Cami&s;ars, and the like. At the approach of Per&s;ecution, it was &s;o contrived, that as &s;he held up her bloody flag, the whole a&s;&s;embly of dead men, like tho&s;e in the Rehear&s;al, &s;tarted up and drew their &s;words. This was followed by great cla&s;hings and noi&s;e, when, in the mid&s;t of the tumult, the figure of Moderation moved gently towards this new army, which, upon her hold|ing up a paper in her hand, in&s;cribed Liberty of Con&s;ci|ence, immediately fell into a heap of carca&s;&s;es, remain|ing in the &s;ame quiet po&s;ture that they lay at fir&s;t.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A continuation of the journal of the Court of Honour, held in Sheer-Lane on Monday the 27th of November, before I&s;aac Bicker&s;taffe, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> cen&s;or of Great Britain.</HEAD>
<P>ELIZABETH MAKEBATE, of the pari&s;h of St Ca|therine's, &s;pin&s;ter, was indicted for &s;urreptitiou&s;ly taking away the ha&s;&s;oc from under the lady Grave-Airs, between the hours of four and five, on Sunday the 26th of November. The pro&s;ecutor depo&s;ed, that as &s;he &s;tood up to make a curt&s;y to a per&s;on of quality in a neigh|bouring pew, the criminal conveyed away the ha&s;&s;oc by &s;tealth, in&s;omuch that the pro&s;ecutor was obliged to &s;it all the while &s;he was at church, or to &s;ay her prayers in a po&s;ture that did not become a woman of her quality. The pri&s;oner pleaded inadvertency, and the jury were going to bring it in chance-medly, had not &s;everal wit|ne&s;&s;es been produced again&s;t the &s;aid Elizabeth Make|bate, that &s;he was an old offender, and a woman of a bad reputation. It appeared in particular, that on the Sun|day before &s;he had detracted from a new petticoat of Mrs. Mary Doelittle, having &s;aid in the hearing of &s;eve|ral credible witne&s;&s;es, that the &s;aid petticoat was &s;cowr|ed, to the great grief and detriment of the &s;aid Mary Doelittle. There were likewi&s;e many evidences produ|ced again&s;t the criminal, that though &s;he never failed to come to church on Sunday, &s;he was a mo&s;t notorious Sabbath-breaker, and that &s;he &s;pent her whole time, du|ring divine &s;ervice, in di&s;paraging other people's clothes, and whi&s;pering to tho&s;e who &s;ate next her. Upon the whole, &s;he was found guilty of the indictment, and re|ceived &s;entence to a&s;k pardon of the pro&s;ecutor upon her bare knees, without either cu&s;hion or ha&s;&s;oc under her, in the face of the court.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="243"><HI>N.B.</HI> As &s;oon as the &s;entence was executed on the criminal, which was done in open court with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, the fir&s;t lady of the bench on Mr. Bicker&s;taffe's right hand &s;tood up, and made a motion to the court, that whereas it was impo&s;&s;ible for women of fa&s;hion to dre&s;s them&s;elves before the church was half done, and whereas many confu&s;ions and inconveniencies did ari&s;e thereupon, it might be lawful for them to &s;end a foot|man, in order to keep their places, as was u&s;ual in o|ther polite and well-regulated a&s;&s;emblies. The motion was ordered to be entered in the books, and con&s;idered at a more convenient time.</P>
<P>Charles Cambric, linen-draper, in the city of We&s;t|min&s;ter, was indicted for &s;peaking ob&s;cenely to the la|dy Penelope Touchwood. It appeared, that the pro&s;e|cutor and her woman going in a &s;tage-coach from Lon|don to Brentford, where they were to be met by the la|dy's own chariot, the criminal and another of his ac|quaintance travelled with them in the &s;ame coach, at which time the pri&s;oner talked bawdy for the &s;pace of three miles and a half. The pro&s;ecutor alleged, that over-again&s;t <HI>the old fox</HI> at Knight&s;bridge he mentioned the word <HI>linen;</HI> that at the further end of Ken&s;ington he made u&s;e of the term <HI>&s;mock;</HI> and that before he came to Hammer&s;mith, he talked almo&s;t a quarter of an hour upon wedding-&s;hifts. The pro&s;ecutor's woman con|firmed what her lady had &s;aid, and added further, that &s;he had never &s;een her lady in &s;o great a confu&s;ion, and in &s;uch a taking, as &s;he was during the whole di&s;cour&s;e of the criminal. The pri&s;oner had little to &s;ay for him|&s;elf, but that he talked only in his own trade, and meant no hurt by what he &s;aid. The jury however found him guilty, and repre&s;ented by their forewoman, that &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es were apt to &s;ully the imagination, and that by a concatenation of ideas, the word <HI>linen</HI> implied many things that were not proper to be &s;tirred up in the mind of a woman who was of the pro&s;ecutor's qua|lity, and therefore gave it as their verdict, that the li|nen-draper
<PB N="241" REF="244">
&s;hould lo&s;e his tongue. Mr. Bicker&s;taffe &s;aid, he thought the pro&s;ecutor's ears were as much to blame as the pri&s;oner's tongue, and therefore gave &s;en|tence as follows: that they &s;hould both be placed over|again&s;t one another in the mid&s;t of the court, there to remain for the &s;pace of one quarter of an hour, during which time, the linen-draper was to be gagged, and the lady to hold her hands clo&s;e upon both her ears, which was executed accordingly.</P>
<P>Edward Callicoat was indicted as an accomplice to Charles Cambric, for that he the &s;aid Edward Callicoat did, by his &s;ilence and his &s;miles, &s;eem to approve and a|bet the &s;aid Charles Cambric in every thing he &s;aid. It appeared, that the pri&s;oner was foreman of the &s;hop to the afore&s;aid Charles Cambric, and by his po&s;t obliged to &s;mile at every thing that the other &s;hould be plea&s;ed to &s;ay: upon which he was acquitted.</P>
<P>Jo&s;ias Shallow was indicted in the name of dame Wi|nifred, &s;ole relict of Richard Dainty, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for having &s;aid &s;everal times in company, and in the hearing of &s;e|veral per&s;ons there pre&s;ent, that he was extremely obli|ged to the widow Dainty, and that he &s;hould never be able &s;ufficiently to expre&s;s his gratitude. The pro&s;ecu|tor urged, that this might bla&s;t her reputation, and that it was in effect a boa&s;ting of favours which he had ne|ver received. The pri&s;oner &s;eemed to be much a&s;to|ni&s;hed at the con&s;truction which was put upon his words, and &s;aid, that he meant nothing by them, but that the widow had befriended him in a lea&s;e, and was very kind to his younger &s;i&s;ter. The jury finding him a little weak in his under&s;tanding, without going out of the court, brought in their verdict Ignoramus.</P>
<P>Ur&s;ula Goodenough was accu&s;ed by the the lady Betty Wou'dbe, for having &s;aid, that &s;he the lady Betty Wou'd|be was painted. The pri&s;oner brought &s;everal per&s;ons of good credit to witne&s;s to her reputation, and proved by undeniable evidences, that &s;he was never at the place where the words were &s;aid to have been uttered. The
<PB N="242" REF="245">
cen&s;or, ob&s;erving the behaviour of the pro&s;ecutor, found rea&s;on to believe that &s;he had indicted the pri&s;oner for no other rea&s;on but to make her complexion be taken notice of, which indeed was very fre&s;h and beautiful: he therefore a&s;ked the offender with a very &s;tern voice, how &s;he could pre&s;ume to &s;pread &s;o groundle&s;s a report? and whether &s;he &s;aw any colours in the lady Wou'dbe's face that could procure credit to &s;uch a fal&s;hood? do you &s;ee (&s;ays he) any lilies or ro&s;es in her cheeks, any bloom, any probability?&mdash;The pro&s;ecutor, not able to bear &s;uch language any longer, told him, that he talk|ed like a blind old fool, and that &s;he was a&s;hamed to have entertained any opinion of his wi&s;dom: but &s;he was put to &s;ilence, and &s;entenced to wear her ma&s;k for five months, and not to pre&s;ume to &s;hew her face till the town &s;hould be empty.</P>
<P>Benjamin Buzzard, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was indicted for having told the lady Everbloom at a public ball, that &s;he looked ve|ry well for a woman of her years. The pri&s;oner not denying the fact, and pre&s;i&s;ting before the court that he looked upon it as a compliment, the jury brought him in <HI>non compos mentis.</HI></P>

<P>WE have a very learned and elaborate di&s;&s;ertation upon thumbs in Montaigne's E&s;&s;ays, and another upon ears in the <HI>Tale of a Tub.</HI> I am here going to write one upon no&s;es, having cho&s;on for my text the fol|lowing ver&s;es out of Hudibras:<Q><PB N="243" REF="246">
<L>So learned Talicotius from</L>
<L>The brawny part of Porter's bum</L>
<L>Cut &s;upplemental no&s;es, which</L>
<L>La&s;ted as long as parent breech:</L>
<L>But when the date of nock was out,</L>
<L>Off drop'd the &s;ympathetic &s;nout.</L></Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding that there is nothing ob&s;cene in na|tural knowlege, and that I intend to give as little offence as may be to readers of a well-bred imagination, I mu&s;t, for my own quiet, de&s;ire the critics (who in all times have been famous for good no&s;es) to refrain from the lecture of this curious tract. The&s;e gentlemen were formerly marked out and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the little rhi|nocerical no&s;e, which was always looked upon as an in|&s;trument of deri&s;ion, and which they were u&s;ed to cock, to&s;s, or draw up in a contemptuous manner, upon read|ing the works of their ingenious contemporaries. It is not therefore for this generation of men that I write the pre&s;ent tran&s;action,
<Q><L>&mdash;Minus aptus acutis</L>
<L>Naribus horum hominum&mdash;</L></Q>
But for the &s;ake of &s;ome of my philo&s;ophical friends in the royal &s;ociety, who peru&s;e di&s;cour&s;es of this nature with a becoming gravity, and a de&s;ire of improving by them.</P>
<P>Many are the opinions of learned men concerning the ri&s;e of that fatal di&s;temper which has always taken a particular plea&s;ure in venting its &s;pight upon the no&s;e. I have &s;een a little burle&s;que poem in Italian that gives a very plea&s;ant account of this matter. The fable of it runs thus: Mars, the God of war, having &s;erved during the &s;iege of Naples in the &s;hape of a French colonel, re|ceived a vi&s;it one night from Venus, the godde&s;s of love, who had been always his profe&s;&s;ed mi&s;tre&s;s and admirer. The poem &s;ays, &s;he came to him in the di&s;gui&s;e of a &s;ut|tling
<PB N="244" REF="247">
wench, with a bottle of brandy under her arm. Let that be as it will, he managed matters &s;o well, that &s;he went away big-bellied, and was at length brought to bed of a little Cupid. This boy, whether it were by rea|&s;on of any bad food that his father had eaten during the &s;iege, or of any particular malignity in the &s;tars that reigned at his nativity, came into the world with a ve|ry &s;ickly look, and crazy con&s;titution. As &s;oon as he was able to handle his bow, he made di&s;coveries of a mo&s;t perver&s;e di&s;po&s;ition. He dipped all his arrows in poi&s;on, that rotted every thing they touched; and what was more particular, aimed all his &s;hafts at the no&s;e, quite contrary to the practice of his elder brothers, who had made a human heart their butt in all countries and ages. To break him of this rogui&s;h trick, his parents put him to &s;chool to Mercury, who did all he could to hinder him from demoli&s;hing the no&s;es of mankind; but in &s;pight of education, the boy continued very unlucky; and though his malice was a little &s;oftened by good in|&s;tructions, he would very frequently let fly an invenom|ed arrow, and wound his votaries oftner in the no&s;e than in the heart. Thus far the fable.</P>
<P>I need not tell my learned reader, that Correggio has drawn a Cupid taking his le&s;&s;on from Mercury, confor|mable to this poem; nor that the poem it&s;elf was de|&s;igned as a burle&s;que upon Fraca&s;torius.</P>
<P>It was a little after this fatal &s;iege of Naples that Ta|licotius begun to practi&s;e in a town of Germany. He was the fir&s;t clap-doctor that I meet with in hi&s;tory, and a greater man in his age than our celebrated Dr. Wall. He &s;aw his &s;pecies extremely mutilated and disfigured by this new di&s;temper that was crept into it; and therefore, in pur&s;uance of a very &s;ea&s;onable invention, &s;et up a ma|nufacture of no&s;es, having fir&s;t got a patent that none &s;hould pre&s;ume to make no&s;es be&s;ides him&s;elf. His fir&s;t patient was a great man of Portugal, who had done good &s;ervices to his country, but in the mid&s;t of them unfor|tunately lo&s;t his no&s;e. Talicotius grafted a new one
<PB N="245" REF="248">
on the remaining part of the gri&s;tle or cartilaginous &s;ub|&s;tance, which would &s;neeze, &s;mell, take &s;nuff, pronounce the letters <HI>M</HI> or <HI>N,</HI> and in &s;hort, do all the functions of a genuine and natural no&s;e. There was however one misfortune in this experiment. The Portugue&s;e's complexion was a little upon the &s;ubfu&s;c, with very black eyes and dark eyebrows, and the no&s;e being taken from a porter that had a white German &s;kin, and cut out of tho&s;e parts that are not expo&s;ed to the &s;un, it was very vi&s;ible that the features of his face were not fellows. In a word, the Conde re&s;embled one of tho&s;e maimed an|tique &s;tatues that has often a modern no&s;e of fre&s;h mar|ble glewed to a face of &s;uch a yellow ivory complexion as nothing can give but age. To remedy this particular for the future, the doctor got together a great collecti|on of porters, men of all complexions, black, brown, fair, dark, &s;allow, pale, and ruddy; &s;o that it was im|po&s;&s;ible for a patient of the mo&s;t out-of-the-way colour not to find a no&s;e to match it.</P>
<P>The doctor's hou&s;e was now very much enlarged, and become a kind of college, or rather ho&s;pital, for the fa&s;hionable cripples of both &s;exes that re&s;orted to him from all parts of Europe. Over his door was fa&s;tened a large golden &s;nout, not unlike that which is placed o|ver the great gates at Brazen-No&s;e college in Oxford; and as it is u&s;ual for the learned in foreign univer&s;ities to di&s;tingui&s;h their hou&s;es by a Latin &s;entence, the do|ctor writ underneath this great golden probo&s;cis two ver&s;es out of Ovid:
<Q><L>Militat omnis amans, habet et &s;ua ca&s;tra Cupido,</L>
<L>Pontice, crede mihi, militat omnis amans.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is reported, that Talicotius had at one time in his hou&s;e twelve German counts, nineteen French marqui&s;|&s;es, and a hundred Spani&s;h cavaliers, be&s;ides one &s;olita|ry Engli&s;h e&s;quire, of whom more hereafter. Though the doctor had the monopoly of no&s;es in his own hands,
<PB N="246" REF="249">
he is &s;aid not to have been unrea&s;onable. Indeed if a man had occa&s;ion for a high Roman no&s;e, he mu&s;t go to the price of it. A carbuncle no&s;e likewi&s;e bore an ex|ce&s;&s;ive rate: but for your ordinary &s;hort turned-up no|&s;es, of which there was the greate&s;t con&s;umption, they co&s;t little or nothing; at lea&s;t the purcha&s;ers thought &s;o, who would have been content to have paid much dearer for them, rather than to have gone without them.</P>
<P>The &s;ympathy betwixt the no&s;e and its parent was very extraordinary. Hudibras has told us, that when the porter died, the no&s;e dropped of cour&s;e, in which ca&s;e it was always u&s;ual to return the no&s;e, in order to have it interred with its fir&s;t owner. The no&s;e was like|wi&s;e affected by the pain as well as death of the original proprietor. An eminent in&s;tance of this nature happen|ed to three Spaniards, who&s;e no&s;es were all made out of the &s;ame piece of brawn. They found them one day &s;hoot and &s;well extremely, upon which they &s;ent to know how the porter did, and heard upon enquiry, that the parent of the no&s;es had been &s;everely kicked the day be|fore, and that the porter kept his bed on account of the brui&s;es it had received. This was highly re&s;ented by the Spaniards, who found out the per&s;on that had u&s;ed the porter &s;o unmercifully, and treated him in the &s;ame manner as if the indignity had been done to their own no&s;es. In this and &s;everal other ca&s;es it might be &s;aid, that the porters led the gentlemen by the no&s;e.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if any thing went ami&s;s with the no&s;e, the porter felt the effects of it, in&s;omuch that it was generally articled with the patient, that he &s;hould not only ab&s;tain from all his old cour&s;es, but &s;hould on no pretence what&s;oever &s;mell pepper, or eat mu&s;tard; on which occa&s;ion, the part where the inci&s;ion had been made was &s;eized with un&s;peakable twinges and prick|ings.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;hman I before mentioned was &s;o very ir|regular, and relap&s;ed &s;o frequently into the di&s;temper
<PB N="247" REF="250">
which at fir&s;t brought him to the learned Talicotius, that in the &s;pace of two years he wore out five no&s;es, and by that means &s;o tormented the porters, that if he would have given 500<HI>l.</HI> for a no&s;e, there was not one of them that would accommodate him. This young gentleman was born of hone&s;t parents, and pa&s;&s;ed his fir&s;t years in foxhunting; but accidentally quitting the woods, and coming up to London, he was &s;o charmed with the beau|ties of the play-hou&s;e, that he had not been in town two days before he got the misfortune which carried off this part of his face. He u&s;ed to be called in Germa|ny, the Engli&s;hman of five no&s;es, and, the gentleman that had thrice as many no&s;es as he had ears: &s;uch was the raillery of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this paper with an admonition to the young men of this town, which I think the more nece&s;|&s;ary, becau&s;e I &s;ee &s;everal new fre&s;h-coloured faces, that have made their fir&s;t appearance in it this winter. I mu&s;t therefore a&s;&s;ure them, that the art of making no|&s;es is entirely lo&s;t; and in the next place, beg of them not to &s;ollow the example of our ordinary town-rakes, who live as if there was a Talicotius to be met with at the corner of every &s;treet. Whatever young men may think, the no&s;e is a very becoming part of the face, and a man makes but a very &s;illy figure without it. But it is the nature of youth not to know the value of any thing till they have lo&s;t it. The general precept there|fore I &s;hall leave with them is, to regard every town-wo|man as a particular kind of &s;iren, that has a de&s;ign upon their no&s;es; and that, amid&s;t her flatteries and allure|ments, they will fancy &s;he &s;peaks to them in that humo|rous phra&s;e of old Plautus:<Q><L>Ego tibi faciem dena&s;abo mordicus.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Keep your face out of my way or I'll bite off your no&s;e.</L></Q></P>

<P>TIMOTHY TREATALL, gent. was indicted by &s;e|veral ladies of his &s;i&s;ter's acquaintance for a very rude affront offered to them at an entertainment, to which he had invited them on Tue&s;day the 7<HI>th</HI> of November la&s;t pa&s;t, between the hours of eight and nine in the e|vening. The indictment &s;et forth, that the &s;aid Mr. Treatall, upon the &s;erving up of the &s;upper, de&s;ired the ladies to take their places according to their different age and &s;eniority, for that it was the way always at his table to pay re&s;pect to years. The indictment added, that this produced an un&s;peakable confu&s;ion in the company; for that the ladies, who before had pre&s;&s;ed together for a place at the upper end of the table, immediately croud|ed with the &s;ame di&s;order towards the end that was quite oppo&s;ite; that Mrs. Frontly had the in&s;olence to clap her&s;elf down at the very lowe&s;t place of the table; that the widow Partlett &s;eated her&s;elf on the right hand of Mrs Frontly, alleging for her excu&s;e, that no ceremo|ny was to be u&s;ed at a round table; that Mrs. Fidget and Mrs. Fe&s;cue di&s;puted above half an hour for the &s;ame chair, and that the latter would not give up the cau&s;e till it was decided by the pari&s;h regi&s;ter, which happened to be kept hard by. The indictment further &s;aid, that the re&s;t of the company who &s;ate down, did it with a re&s;erve to their right, which they were at liberty to a&s;&s;ert on a|nother occa&s;ion; and that Mrs. Mary Pippe, an old maid, was placed by the unanimous vote of the whole company at the upper end of the table, from whence &s;he had the confu&s;ion to behold &s;everal mothers of families
<PB N="249" REF="252">
among her inferiors. The criminal alleged in his de|fence, that what he had done, was to rai&s;e mirth, and a|void ceremony, and that the ladies did not complain of his rudene&s;s till the next morning, having eaten up what he had provided for them with great readine&s;s and ala|crity. The cen&s;or frowning upon him, told him, that he ought not to di&s;cover &s;o much levity in matters of a &s;e|rious nature, and (upon the jury's bringing in him guil|ty) &s;entenced him to treat the whole a&s;&s;embly of ladies over again, and to take care that he did it with the de|corum which was due to per&s;ons of their quality.</P>
<P>Rebecca Shapely, &s;pin&s;ter, was indicted by Mrs. Sarah Smack, for &s;peaking many words reflecting upon her re|putation, and the heels of her &s;ilk &s;lippers, which the pri|&s;oner had maliciou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ted to be two inches higher than they really were. The pro&s;ecutor urged, as an aggra|vation of her guilt, that the pri&s;oner was her&s;elf guilty of the &s;ame kind of forgery which &s;he had laid to the pro|&s;ecutor's charge, for that &s;he the &s;aid Rebecca Shapely did always wear a pair of &s;teel bodice, and a fal&s;e rump. The cen&s;or ordered the &s;lippers to be produced in open court, where the heels were adjudged to be of the &s;tatutable &s;ize. He then ordered the grand jury to &s;earch the criminal, who, after &s;ome time &s;pent therein, acquitted her of the bodice, but found her guilty of the rump; upon which &s;he received &s;entence as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>
<P>William Trippitt, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of the Middle Temple, brought his action again&s;t the lady Elizabeth Prudely, for hav|ing refu&s;ed him her hand as he offered to lead her to her coach from the opera. The plaintiff &s;et forth, that he had entered him&s;elf into the li&s;t of tho&s;e volunteers who offi|ciate every night behind the boxes as gentlemen-u&s;hers of the play-hou&s;e; that he had been at a con&s;iderable charge in white gloves, periwigs, and &s;nuff-boxes, in or|der to qualify him&s;elf for that employment, and in hopes of making his fortune by it. The council for the defen|dant replied, that the plaintiff had given out that he was within a month of wedding their client, and that &s;he had
<PB N="250" REF="253">
refu&s;ed her hand to him in ceremony, le&s;t he &s;hould in|terpret it as a promi&s;e that &s;he would give it him in mar|riage. As &s;oon as their pleadings on both &s;ides were fi|ni&s;hed, the cen&s;or ordered the plaintiff to be ca&s;hiered from his office of gentleman-u&s;her to the play-hou&s;e, &s;ince it was too plain that he had undertaken it with an ill de|&s;ign; and at the &s;ame time ordered the defendent either to marry the &s;aid plaintiff, or to pay him half a crown for the new pair of gloves and coach-hire that he was at the expence of in her &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The lady Townly brought an action of debt again&s;t Mrs. Flambeau, for that Mrs. Flambeau had not been to &s;ee the &s;aid lady Townly, and wi&s;h her joy, &s;ince her marriage with Sir Ralph, notwith&s;tanding &s;he the &s;aid la|dy Townly had paid Mrs. Flambeau a vi&s;it upon her fir&s;t coming to town. It was urged in the behalf of the de|fendant, that the plaintiff had never given her any regu|lar notice of her being in town; that the vi&s;it &s;he alleged had been made on a Monday, which &s;he knew was a day on which Mrs. Flambeau was always abroad, having &s;et a&s;ide that only day in the week to mind the affairs of her family; that the &s;ervant who enquired whether &s;he was at home, did not give the vi&s;iting knock; that it was not between the hours of five and eight in the evening; that there were no candles lighted up; that it was not on Mrs. Flambeau's day; and in &s;hort, that there was not one of the e&s;&s;ential points ob&s;erved that con&s;titute a vi&s;it. She further proved by her porter's book, which was produced in court, that &s;he had paid the lady Town|ly a vi&s;it on the twenty fourth day of March, ju&s;t before her leaving the town, in the year 1709-10, for which &s;he was &s;till creditor to the &s;aid lady Townly. To this the plaintiff only replied, that &s;he was now only under covert, and not liable to any debts contracted when &s;he was a &s;ingle woman. Mr. Bicker&s;taffe finding the cau&s;e to be very intricate, and that &s;everal points of honour were likely to ari&s;e in it, he deferred giving judgment upon it till the next &s;e&s;&s;ion day, at which time he ordered the
<PB N="251" REF="254">
ladies on his left hand to pre&s;ent to the court a table of all the laws relating to vi&s;its.</P>
<P>Winifred Leer brought her action again&s;t Richard Sly, for having broken a marriage contract, and wedded an|other woman, after he had engaged him&s;elf to marry the &s;aid Winifred Leer. She alleged, that he had ogled her twice at an opera, thrice in St. James's church, and once at Powel's puppet-&s;how, at which time he promi&s;ed her marriage by a &s;ide-glance, as her friend could te&s;tify that &s;ate by her. Mr. Bicker&s;taffe finding that the defendant had made no further overture of love or marriage, but by looks and ocular engagement; yet at the &s;ame time con|&s;idering how very apt &s;uch impudent &s;educers are to lead the ladies hearts a&s;tray, ordered the criminal to &s;tand up|on the &s;tage in the Hay-market, between each act of the next opera, there to be expo&s;ed to public view as a fal&s;e <HI>ogler.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the ri&s;ing of the court, Mr. Bicker&s;taffe having taken one of the&s;e counterfeits in the very fact, as he was ogling a lady of the grand jury, ordered him to be &s;eiz|ed, and pro&s;ecuted upon the &s;tatute of ogling. He like|wi&s;e directed the clerk of the court to draw up an e|dict again&s;t the&s;e common cheats that make women be|lieve they are di&s;tracted for them by &s;taring them out of countenance, and often bla&s;t a lady's reputation whom they never &s;poke to, by &s;aucy looks and di&s;tant famili|arities.</P>

now in force, relating to vi&s;its and vi&s;iting-days, metho|dically dige&s;ted under their re&s;pective heads, which the cen&s;or ordered to be laid upon the table, and afterwards proceeded upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day.</P>
<P>Henry Heedle&s;s, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was indicted by colonel Tou|chy, of her maje&s;ty's trained-bands, upon an action of a&s;&s;ault and battery; for that he the &s;aid Mr. Heedle&s;s hav|ing e&s;pied a feather upon the &s;houlder of the &s;aid colo|nel, &s;truck it off gently with the end of a walking-&s;taff, value three pence. It appeared, that the pro&s;ecutor did not think him&s;elf injured till a few days after the afore|&s;aid blow was given him; but that having ruminated with him&s;elf for &s;everal days, and conferred upon it with other officers of the militia, he concluded, that he had in effect been cudgelled by Mr. Heedle&s;s, and that he ought to re&s;ent it accordingly. The council for the pro&s;ecu|tor alleged, that the &s;houlder was the tendere&s;t part in a man of honour; that it had a natural antipathy to a &s;tick, and that every touch of it, with any thing made in the fa&s;hion of a cane, was to be interpreted as a wound in that part, and a violation of the per&s;on's honour who re|ceived it. Mr. Heedle&s;s replied, that what he had done was out of kindne&s;s to the pro&s;ecutor, as not thinking it proper for him to appear at the head of the trained|bands with a feather upon his &s;houlder; and further add|ed, that the &s;tick he had made u&s;e of on this occa&s;ion was &s;o very &s;mall, that the pro&s;ecutor could not have felt it, had he broken it on his &s;houlders. The cen&s;or here|upon directed the jury, to examine into the nature of the &s;taff, for that a great deal would depend upon that particular. Upon which he explained to them the diffe|rent degrees of offence that might be given by the touch of crab-tree from that of cane, and by the touch of cane from that of a plain hazle &s;tick. The jury, after a &s;hort peru&s;al of the &s;taff, declared their opinion by the mouth of their foreman, that the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;taff was Briti&s;h oak. The cen&s;or then ob&s;erving that there was &s;ome du&s;t on the &s;kirts of the criminal's coat, order|ed
<PB N="253" REF="256">
the pro&s;ecutor to beat it off with his afore&s;aid oaken plant; and thus, &s;aid the cen&s;or, I &s;hall decide this cau&s;e by the law of retaliation: If Mr. Heedle&s;s did the colo|nel a good office, the colonel will by this means return it in kind; but if Mr. Heedle&s;s &s;hould at any time boa&s;t that he had cudgelled the colonel, or laid his &s;taff over his &s;houlders, the colonel might boa&s;t in his turn, that he has bru&s;hed Mr. Heedle&s;s jacket, or (to u&s;e the phra&s;e of an ingenious author) that he has rubbed him down with an oaken towel.</P>
<P>Benjamin Bu&s;y, of London, merchant, was indicted by Ja&s;per Tattle, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for having puiled out his watch and looked upon it thrice, while the &s;aid e&s;quire Tattle was giving him an account of the &s;uneral of the &s;aid e&s;quire Tattle's fir&s;t wife. The pri&s;oner alleged in his defence, that he was going to buy &s;tocks at the time when he met the pro&s;ecutor; and that, during the &s;tory of the pro&s;e|cutor, the &s;aid &s;tocks ro&s;e above two <HI>per cent.</HI> to the great detriment of the pri&s;oner. The pri&s;oner further brought &s;everal witne&s;&s;es, that the &s;aid Ja&s;per Tattle, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was a mo&s;t notorious &s;tory teller; that before he met the pri&s;o|ner, he had hindered one of the pri&s;oner's acquaintance from the pur&s;uit of his lawful bu&s;ine&s;s, with the account of his &s;econd marriage; and that he had detained another by the button of his coat that very morning, till he had heard &s;everal witty &s;ayings and contrivances of the pro|&s;ecutor's elde&s;t &s;on, who was a boy of about five years of age. Upon the whole matter, Mr. Bicker&s;taffe di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the accu&s;ation, as frivolous, and &s;entenced the pro&s;ecu|tor to pay damages to the pri&s;oner for what the pri&s;oner had lo&s;t by giving him &s;o long and patient an hearing. He further reprimanded the pro&s;ecutor very &s;everely, and told him, that if he proceeded in his u&s;ual manner to interrupt the bu&s;ine&s;s of mankind, he would &s;et a fine upon him for every quarter of an hour's impertinence, and regulate the &s;aid fine according as the time of the per&s;on &s;o injured &s;hould appear to be more or le&s;s pre|cious.</P>

Sir Paul Swa&s;h, kt. was indicted by Peter Double, gent. for not returning the bow which he received of the &s;aid Peter Double, on Wedne&s;day the &s;ixth in&s;tant, at the play|hou&s;e in the Hay-market. The pri&s;oner denied the re|ceipt of any &s;uch bow, and alleged in his defence, that the pro&s;ecutor would oftentimes look full in his face, but that when he bowed to the pro&s;ecutor he would take no notice of it; or bow to &s;ome body el&s;e that &s;ate quite on the other &s;ide of him. He likewi&s;e alleged, that &s;everal ladies had complained of the pro&s;ecutor, who, after og|ling them a quarter of an hour, upon their making a curt|&s;y to him, would not return the civility of a bow. The cen&s;or ob&s;erving &s;everal glances of the pro&s;ecutor's eye, and perceiving, that when he talked to the court, he look|ed upon the jury, found rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that there was a wrong ca&s;t in his &s;ight, which upon examination proved true. The cen&s;or therefore ordered the pri&s;oner (that he might not produce any more confu&s;ions in public a&s;&s;em|blies) never to bow to any body whom he did not at the &s;ame time call to by his name.</P>
<P>Oliver Bluff, and Benjamin Browbeat, were indicted for going to fight a duel &s;ince the erection of the Court of Honour. It appeared, that they were both taken up in the &s;treet as they pa&s;&s;ed by the court, in their way to the fields behind Montague-hou&s;e. The criminals would an&s;wer nothing for them&s;elves, but that they were going to execute a challenge which had been made above a week before the Court of Honour was erected. The cen&s;or finding &s;ome rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect (by the &s;turdine&s;s of their behaviour) that they were not &s;o very brave as they would have the court believe them, ordered them both to be &s;earched by the grand jury, who found a brea&s;t-plate up|on the one, and two quires of paper upon the other. The brea&s;t-plate was immediately ordered to be hung upon a peg over Mr. Bicker&s;taffe's tribunal, and the paper to be laid upon the table for the u&s;e of his clerk. He then or|dered the criminals to button up their bo&s;oms, and, if they plea&s;ed, proceed to their duel. Upon which they

<P>I HAVE heard, that it is a rule among the conventuals of &s;everal orders in the Romi&s;h church, to &s;hut them|&s;elves up at a certain time of the year, not only from the world in general, but from the members of their own fraternity, and to pa&s;s away &s;everal days by them&s;elves in &s;ettling accounts between their maker and their own &s;ouls, in cancelling unrepented crimes, and renewing their contracts of obedience for the future. Such &s;tated times for particular acts of devotion, or the exerci&s;e of certain religious duties, have been enjoined in all civil govern|ments, whatever deity they wor&s;hipped, or whatever re|ligion they profe&s;&s;ed. That which may be done at all times is often totally neglected and forgotten, unle&s;s fix|ed and determined to &s;ome time more than another; and therefore, though &s;everal duties may be &s;uitable to every day of our lives, they are mo&s;t likely to be performed if &s;ome days are more particularly &s;et apart for the practice of them. Our church has accordingly in&s;tituted &s;everal &s;ea&s;ons of devotion, when time, cu&s;tom, pre&s;cription, and (if I may &s;o &s;ay) the fa&s;hion it&s;elf, call upon a man to be &s;erious and attentive to the great end of his being.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="259">
I have hinted in &s;ome former papers, that the great|e&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of men in all ages and countries, particu|larly in Rome and Greece, were renowned for their pie|ty and virtue. It is now my intention to &s;hew how tho&s;e in our nation. that have been unque&s;tionably the mo&s;t e|minent for learning and knowlege, were likewi&s;e the mo&s;t eminent for their adherence to the religion of their country.</P>
<P>I might produce very &s;hining examples from among the clergy; but becau&s;e prie&s;t cra&s;t is the common cry of every cavilling empty &s;cribler, I &s;hall &s;hew, that all the laymen who have exerted a more than ordinary genius in their writings, and were the glory of their times, were men who&s;e hopes were filled with immortality, and the pro&s;pect of future rewards, and men who lived in a dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all the doctrines of revealed reli|gion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in this paper only in&s;tance Sir Francis Bacon, a man, who, for the greatne&s;s of genius, and compa&s;s of knowlege, did honour to his age and country; I could almo&s;t &s;ay to human nature it&s;elf. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at once all tho&s;e extraordinary talents which were divided among&s;t the greate&s;t authors of antiquity. He had the &s;ound, di|&s;tinct, comprehen&s;ive knowlege of Ari&s;totle, with all the beautiful lights, graces and embelli&s;hments of Cicero. One does not know which to admire mo&s;t in his writ|ings, the &s;trength of rea&s;on, force of &s;tyle, or brightne&s;s of imagination.</P>
<P>This author has remarked in &s;everal parts of his works, that a thorough in&s;ight into philo&s;ophy makes a good be|liever, and that a &s;mattering in it naturally produces &s;uch a race of de&s;picable infidels as the little profligate writ|ers of the pre&s;ent age, whom (I mu&s;t confe&s;s) I have al|ways accu&s;ed to my&s;elf, not &s;o much for their want of faith as their want of learning.</P>
<P>I was infinitely plea&s;ed to find among the works of this extraordinary man a prayer of his own compo&s;ing, which, for the elevation of thought, and greatne&s;s of ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="257" REF="260">
&s;eems rather the devotion of an angel than of a man. His principal fault &s;eems to have been the ex|ce&s;s of that virtue which covers a multitude of faults. This betrayed him to &s;o great an indulgence towards his &s;ervants, who made a corrupt u&s;e of it, that it &s;tripped him of all tho&s;e riches and honours which a long &s;eries of merits had heaped upon him. But in this prayer, at the &s;ame time that we find him pro&s;trating him&s;elf before the great mercy-&s;eat, and humbled under afflictions which at that time lay heavy upon him; we &s;ee him &s;upported by the &s;en&s;e of his integrity, his zeal, his devotion, and his love to mankind, which give him a much higher fi|gure in the minds of thinking men, than that greatne&s;s had done from which he was fallen. I &s;hall beg leave to write down the prayer it&s;elf, with the title to it, as it was found among his lord&s;hip's papers, written in his own hand; not being able to furni&s;h my reader with an enter|tainment more &s;uitable to this &s;olemn time.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="prayer">
<HEAD>A Prayer or P&s;alm made by my Lord Bacon, chan|cellor of England.</HEAD>
<P>MOST gracious Lord God, my merciful Father; from my youth up, my Creator, my Redeemer, my comforter. Thou, O Lord, &s;ounde&s;t and &s;earche&s;t the depths and &s;ecrets of all hearts; Thou acknowlege&s;t the upright of heart; Thou judge&s;t the hypocrite; Thou pondere&s;t men's thoughts and doings as in a balance; Thou mea&s;ure&s;t their intentions as with a line; vanity and crooked ways cannot be hid from Thee.</P>
<P>Remember, O Lord! how thy &s;ervant hath walked before thee; remember what I have fir&s;t &s;ought, and what hath been principal in my intentions. I have loved thy a&s;&s;emblies, I have mourned for the divi&s;ions of thy church, I have de|lighted in the brightne&s;s of thy &s;anctuary. This vine, which thy right hand hath planted in this nation, I have ever pray|ed unto Thee, that it might have the fir&s;t and the latter rain, and that it might &s;tretch her branches to the &s;eas, and to
<PB N="258" REF="261">
the floods. The &s;tate and bread of the poor and oppre&s;&s;ed have been precious in mine eyes; I have hated all cruelty and hardne&s;s of heart; I have (though in a de&s;pi&s;ed weed) pro|cured the good of all men. If any have been my enemies, I thought not of them, neither hath the &s;un almo&s;t &s;et upon my di&s;plea&s;ure; but I have been as a dove, free from &s;uperfluity of maliciou&s;ne&s;s. Thy creatures have been my books, but thy &s;criptures much more. I have &s;ought Thee in the courts, fields and gardens, but I have found Thee in thy temples.</P>
<P>Thou&s;ands have been my &s;ins, and ten thou&s;ands my tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, but thy &s;anctifications have remained with me, and my heart (through thy grace) hath been an unquenched coal upon thine altar.</P>
<P>O Lord, my &s;trength! I have &s;ince my youth met with Thee in all my ways, by thy fatherly compa&s;&s;ions, by thy comfortable cha&s;ti&s;ements, and by thy mo&s;t vi&s;ible providence. As thy fa|vours have encrea&s;ed upon me, &s;o have thy corrections; &s;o as thou ha&s;t been always near me, O Lord! And ever as my worldly ble&s;&s;ings were exalted, &s;o &s;ecret darts from Thee have pierced me; and when I have a&s;cended before men, I have de|&s;cended in humiliation before Thee. And now when I thought mo&s;t of peace and honour, thy hand is heavy upon me, and hath humbled me according to thy former loving-kindne&s;s, keeping me &s;till in thy fatherly &s;chool, not as a ba&s;tard but as a child. Ju&s;t are thy judgments upon me for my &s;ins, which are more in number than the &s;ands of the &s;ea, but have no proportion to thy mercies; for what are the &s;ands of the &s;ea? Earth, hea|vens, and all the&s;e, are nothing to thy mercies. Be&s;ides my in|numerable &s;ins, I confe&s;s before Thee, that I am debtor to Thee for the gracious talent of thy gifts and graces, which I have neither put into a napkin, nor put it (as I ought) to ex|changers, where it might have made be&s;t profit, but mi&s;pent it in things for which I was lea&s;t fit: So I may truly &s;ay, my &s;oul hath been a &s;tranger in the cour&s;e of my pilgrimage. Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for my Saviour's &s;ake, and receive me unto thy bo&s;om, or guide me in thy ways.</P>
