<P>_IT will be nece&s;&s;ary to enter a little into the Hi&s;tory of our Trade with
<HI>France,</HI> for the la&s;t 40 or 45 Years: And becau&s;e &s;ome Period of Time is
proper in all &s;uch Ca&s;es to take a Ri&s;e from, it &s;hall be placed at the
Year 1660. If any think that Time is not &s;ufficiently remote, they &s;hall
be fairly followed, let them go back as far as they plea&s;e: In the mean
while, I mu&s;t take Notice to the <HI>Reader,</HI> that the Particulars are too copious and exten|&s;ive,
and e&s;pecially their Numbers &s;o pre&s;&s;ing; that no Time or Room can be &s;par'd
for <HI>Preambles,</HI> and <HI>Introductions.</HI></P>
<P>About the Year 1660, the general Book of Rates was made in <HI>England,</HI> according
to an Act of Parliament, whereby a Sub&s;idy of Tonnage was laid on <HI>Wines</HI> and <HI>Bran|dies,</HI>
and a Sub&s;idy of Poundage after the Rate of 5 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> upon all Goods and Mer|chandizes
Imported.</P>
<P>In Imitation of this, in the Year 1664, the <HI>French</HI> made a General <HI>Tariff</HI> or Book
of Rates, wherein they followed us in Rating all Goods and Merchandizes at a Tax
of about 5<HI>l. per Cent. ad Valorem,</HI> except that, for the Encouragement of their own
People to improve in Trade and Manufactures, all the Manufactures of <HI>Silk, Gold, Silver,
Hair, Thread,</HI> and <HI>Wool,</HI> were Rated at 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> according to their Value. This <HI>Tariff</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
was e&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eemed by all the Nations in the&s;e parts of Europe, to be very ea&s;y, and not
the lea&s;t Interruption to their Trade with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>Reader</HI> may &s;ee at once what was paid upon our <HI>Engli&s;h Manufactures</HI> by
that <HI>Tariff,</HI> and what has been laid on in <HI>France</HI> &s;ince that time, the foregoing Table
is plac'd at the begining of this Paper; and al&s;o, as what there will be Occa&s;ion often
to mention, and refer to: Out of which the <HI>Whale-bone, Fins,</HI> and <HI>Oyl,</HI> might have
been omitted; becau&s;e we have no Share of that Trade: But as it may be u&s;eful for
the Information of &s;ome People, the whole is above Incerted.</P>
<P>All our <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> Exported from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> are reduced to the
old Duties payable by the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664. Except <HI>Broad-Cloth</HI> and <HI>Serges,</HI> which are
to pay, (as by the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1699) (that al&s;o being capable of being moderated by Com|mi&s;&s;ioners)
thus:</P>
<P><HI>Broad-Cloth,</HI> which from the Year 1667, paid 80 <HI>Livres,</HI> will now pay only 55 <HI>Livres.</HI></P>
<P>Mill'd <HI>Serges,</HI> which paid 15 <HI>Livres,</HI> now 11 <HI>Livres.</HI></P>
<P>All other wollen Goods pay after the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664, (as afore&s;aid,) when their
<HI>Wines</HI> paid Duty here but 7 <HI>l. 10 s. per Ton,</HI> and <HI>Brandy</HI> but 1 <HI>l. 10 s.</HI></P>
<P>This part being thus &s;tated, let us turn the Tables, and view the other &s;ide of the Trade,
(viz.) Our Import from <HI>France,</HI> where the Particulars will be very &s;urprizing; and this
following Conclu&s;ion is mo&s;t natural there from, (viz.) That if we Traded with <HI>France</HI>
to our Advantage before, much more mu&s;t we do &s;o now; for the State of the Trade
between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> &s;tands thus.</P>
<P>An Account of the &s;everal Duties which were payable upon <HI>French</HI> Goods Imported into <HI>England</HI>

<P>That nothing might be wanting to &s;ecure to <HI>Great Britain</HI> a compleat Freedom of their
Trade to <HI>France;</HI> all the Advantages of the Treaties <HI>France</HI> has made with other Na|tions,
are contained in this Treaty, and all the Privileges &s;tipulated for them, are by
her Maje&s;ty's Care for her Subjects Profit made our own, as by the <HI>Eighth</HI> and other
<HI>Article<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">;</HI> whereby it is &s;tipulated, that her Maje&s;ty's Subjects &s;hall be Treated in <HI>France</HI>
in the &s;ame manner as the Nations they mo&s;t favoured, and even as the <HI>French</HI> King's
own Subjects.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Ninth Article <HI>adds,</HI> And all Prohibitions, Tariffs, Edicts, Declarations, Decrees made
in <HI>France</HI> &s;ince the &s;aid <HI>Tariff,</HI> of 1664 contrary thereunto, in Re&s;pect of the Goods and Mer|chandizes
of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> &s;hall be repealed.</P>
<P>As to this it is objected; that it is not &s;aid <HI>Goods and Merchandizes of the Subjects of</HI>
Great Britain, but <HI>Goods and Merchandizes of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>which implyes</HI> (&s;ay they) <HI>the
Manufactures of</HI> Great Britain <HI>only.</HI> But the Ab&s;urdity here is &s;o gro&s;s, that it is &s;trange
the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Turkey Company</HI> &s;hould fall into it: For (1.) if it had been meant of
the Manufactures of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> only, it would have been &s;aid, <HI>The</HI> GROWTH <HI>and</HI>
PRODUCE, <HI>not the Goods and Merchandizes.</HI> By Growth and Produce, indeed the
Manufactures had been under&s;tood; but by the Goods and Merchandizes of <HI>Great
Britain</HI> mu&s;t be under&s;tood, the Goods and Merchandizes, which the Subjects
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> TRADE IN. But (2.) it is out of Que&s;tion, That if the taking
off the Prohibitions, &amp;c. of the Goods and Merchandizes of <HI>Great Britain</HI> was meant
only of the Manufactures, then was the whole <HI>Levant Trade</HI> prohibited &s;till; which
the Gentlemen do not pretend to.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the Con&s;truction the Company would have put on&punc; the Words
of the 9th. <HI>Article,</HI> (viz.) Goods and Merchandizes of <HI>Britain,</HI> would be the Ruin of that
very Trade which they Petition to &s;upport, and would Prohibit all their <HI>Levant</HI> Goods
in <HI>France.</HI> Such People, like Children, mu&s;t be dealt with by the Nature of things, and
mu&s;t have given them not always what they DO ask, but what they WOULD ask.</P>

Some Con&s;iderations might be offered here, upon the <HI>Turkey</HI> Companies de&s;iring the

that the Silk Manuf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ctures here &s;hould receive Encouragement, as if carrying
the Silk abroad (which is a means to keep up the Price of Silk) &s;hould at the &s;ame time

It would be rea&s;onable here to de&s;ire tho&s;e People who in&s;i&s;t &s;o much upon this Re|&s;erve
of <HI>Cloths</HI> and <HI>Serges</HI> out of the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664, to con&s;ider what the exception
amounts to, and how far it may hurt the Trade, that they may Judge whether the
Damage is equal to the Complaint: To this purpo&s;e the Difference in the <HI>Serges</HI> is &s;et
down again here; (viz.) That the <HI>Serges</HI> which paid 10 Livres in 1664, and were af|terwards
brought to 15, and then to 24, and after that prohibited, may now be freely Im|ported
into <HI>France</HI> paying only 11 Livres, that is to &s;ay, one Livre advance upon a
piece of 15 Ells; and the Difference upon <HI>Cloths</HI> is, that the Piece which paid 40
Livres before, in 1664, mu&s;t pay now 55, being 15 Livres upon about 31 Yards <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>To make this E&s;timate more plain, it is to be noted, that the <HI>Ell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> mention'd in all
the&s;e Ca&s;es is to be under&s;tood the <HI>French Ell</HI> containing 5 Quarters of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Yard,
and &s;o the Account of the Exception of <HI>Cloths,</HI> and <HI>Cloth Serges,</HI> may be read thus.</P>
<P><HI>Cloths per piece</HI> containing 25 <HI>Ells,</HI> that is, 31 <HI>Engli&s;h Yards</HI> and a <HI>Quarter,</HI> to pay 15
<HI>Livres</HI> more than by the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664.</P>
<P><HI>Cloth Serges per piece</HI> containing 15 <HI>Ells,</HI> that is 18 <HI>Yards</HI> and 3 <HI>Quarters,</HI> to pay 1
<HI>Livre</HI> more than by the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering Men, when they come to weigh this, will be apt to wonder what it is
the Trading part of this Nation have been &s;o much allarm'd at in the Treaty with
<HI>France,</HI> and will hardly be brought to believe that the Complaints which have been
made of ruining our <HI>Manufactures</HI> and encouraging the <HI>French,</HI> &s;hould all be rai&s;ed from
the&s;e &s;mall Differences.</P>
<P>Would the&s;e People turn the <HI>Tables,</HI> and make the Ca&s;e of <HI>France</HI> here the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r own, what
loud Complaints would they make in <HI>England,</HI> if any <HI>Manufactures</HI> which our own Peo|ple
were endeavouring to make at home, &s;hould have been admitted by the Treaty
from <HI>France,</HI> with alike &s;mall Advance on the <HI>French</HI> Goods more than they paid in
1664. Whereas every body is &s;en&s;ible that the <HI>French</HI> are to pay here upon all their
Goods 2, 3, 4 or 500<HI>l. per Cent</HI> higher Duties than they paid in 1664, and in &s;ome Goods
much more. Had the&s;e advanced Duties been taken off, how would they alledge that
Foreigners were encouraged; that the Bread was taken out of the Mouths of our own Peo|ple;
that the Importing <HI>Manufactures</HI> from abroad, which we could make at Home, was
taking away the Employment from our own Poor to give to the <HI>French:</HI> Yet this is
the Ca&s;e here. The <HI>French</HI> have given all the Encouragment they could to their Peo|ple
to fall upon the making the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> it is &s;uppo&s;ed
none can blame them for that; &s;ome &s;teps they have taken in it which promi&s;ed them
Succe&s;s, while the Duties of 80 <HI>Livres</HI> and 120 <HI>Livres</HI> were laid on <HI>Engli&s;h Cloths;</HI> and
yet even then, great Quantities of <HI>Engli&s;h Cloth</HI> were carried into <HI>France,</HI> which obli|ged
the King of <HI>France</HI> at la&s;t, to make a Prohibition of <HI>Engli&s;h Woollon Manufactures</HI>
in general, (viz) in the Year 1701.</P>
<P>But after all the&s;e <HI>Advances</HI> in the <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King being obli|ged

<P>There is ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">dly a <HI>Manufacture</HI> Erected by us in <HI>Britain</HI> in the memory of Man,
but that if the high <HI>Duties</HI> laid upon Forreign Goods of the &s;ame kind were taken

thereof mu&s;t lay them down: If the <HI>Manufacturers</HI> of <HI>Paper, Linnen Cloth,

<P><PB N="8" REF="7">

of</HI> Wool, <HI>and wrought in</HI> Great Britain, <HI>all are reduced by this</HI> Tariff <HI>to the Duties paya|ble
in</HI> 1664.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid of the Liberty of Commerce obtained by the Treaty with <HI>France,</HI>
the Reduction of the Duties in <HI>France</HI> to the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664, and the Re&s;erve or Limi|tation
of two Species of our <HI>Manufactures</HI> only, (viz) of <HI>Broad Cloths</HI> and <HI>Serges,</HI> to a &s;mall
Advance of Duty; has been more than &s;ufficient to explain tho&s;e things to any Mens
Under&s;tandings, which are not politically dull: Unle&s;s the&s;e People expected that her
Maje&s;ty &s;hould have made a Condition with the <HI>French</HI> King, that his Subjects &s;hould
make no <HI>Woollen Cloth,</HI> or that when they had made it, they &s;hould not export it to
<HI>Turkey,</HI> for fear of prejudicing our <HI>Levant</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>If the <HI>French</HI> Merchants in <HI>Turkey</HI> hold their <HI>Cloths</HI> up to equal Price with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
no Buyer will take them, except when a &s;ufficient Quantity of <HI>Engli&s;h Cloth</HI> cannot be
had to &s;upply the Market.</P>
<P>The <HI>French Cloths</HI> being inferiour to the <HI>English</HI> in Quality, are for that Rea&s;on, and
no other, Sold in <HI>Turkey</HI> at a lower Price.</P>
<P>It is evident that the <HI>French</HI> want the Materials, (viz) the <HI>Wool,</HI> e&s;pecially in tho&s;e
parts of <HI>France</HI> where their <HI>Cloths</HI> for the <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade are made; and whither the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Iri&s;h Wool</HI> which they get by Stealth, cannot be carried without very great
Expence; and that the <HI>Wool</HI> they make u&s;e of in&s;tead thereof, and to mix with the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h
Wool,</HI> is of an inferiour Quality to the <HI>Engli&s;h Wool,</HI> they them&s;elves will not deny.
But if the&s;e were not &s;o, and they were to make <HI>Cloth</HI> wholly of <HI>Spani&s;h Wool,</HI> or of
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h Wool</HI> mixt, yet the general Way of Workman&s;hip of the <HI>French</HI> Na|tion,
is known to be &s;lighter and loo&s;er in all their <HI>Manufactures,</HI> than the <HI>Manufa|ctures</HI>
of the like kind made here, and that our Workmen perform almo&s;t all kinds of
Work-firmer and more &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">antial, not only than the <HI>French,</HI> but al&s;o than any other
People. So that our <HI>Cloths,</HI> and even all our <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> will Sell for a better
Price, than <HI>Manufactures</HI> of the &s;ame Denomination from other Countries.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Silk Manufactures,</HI> they have &s;uch a &s;ufficient Provi&s;ion, made for them,
and &s;uch Encouragement given them already by the high Duties on Foreign wrought
<HI>Silks,</HI> as well of <HI>France</HI> as of any other Country, that as they &s;tood in no need of Pro|hibitions
during the War, &s;o they &s;tand in need of no farther A&s;&s;i&s;tance during the
Peace.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, as they have nothing to ask but that tho&s;e Duties &s;hould remain;
&s;o the <HI>Treaty of Commerce</HI> has taken none of them away; and if the <HI>Silk Manufacture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t with that Difference upon them which tho&s;e Duties have laid, neither
would they &s;ub&s;i&s;t with a Total Prohibition.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable, that during the &s;aid high Duties, particularly upon <HI>Alamodes,</HI> and
<HI>Lustrings,</HI> none of them have been Imported here, that is, legally Imported; as for
Clande&s;tine Importation, or Running of Goods, that can be no Argument, becau&s;e nei|ther
<PB N="9" REF="8">
can the Quantity be great, or is it po&s;&s;ible entirely to prevent tho&s;e things either
in this Country or in any other. The Difference between the Manufactures of <HI>Silk</HI>
at home, and tho&s;e imported, &s;tands thus:</P>
<P>Foreign wrought <HI>Silks</HI> of all kinds, pay for every 20 pound Weight, <HI>L. 12. 3. 7. Netts Duty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Alamodes</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;trings,</HI> pay for every 20 pound Weight, <HI>L. 31. 17. 3. Nett Duty.</HI></P>
<P>Now if the Foreign wrought <HI>Silks</HI> pay above 12 <HI>Shillings per Pound</HI> Weight, Duty up|on
Importation, all Di&s;counts taken off; the Di&s;advantage which they mu&s;t lie under,
mu&s;t exceedingly le&s;&s;en that Importation, and &s;eems &s;ufficient not only to encourage,
but to quicken the Indu&s;try of our own <HI>Weavers.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ince the Encouragement of the <HI>Silk</HI> Trade, and Employment of the <HI>Weavers</HI>
is &s;poken of as a thing of &s;uch extraordinary Weight, it may be very nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate
the Ca&s;e of <HI>Manufacturing</HI> in general, that our Opinion of things may be rightly bal|lanc'd.</P>
<P>It
is an undoubted Rule of Trade, that the Employment of our own Poor, and Con|&s;umption
of our own Growth, is the fir&s;t Principal of <HI>Commerce,</HI> and &s;hould be the la&s;t
End of all our National Improvement.</P>
<P>As <HI>Great Britain</HI> is &s;tated in Matters of Trade, this Concern for the General Inte|re&s;t
of that Trade, centers upon our <HI>Woollen Manufacture:</HI> There is a ju&s;t Concern
due to every Branch of Trade, but to that mo&s;t, which mo&s;t contributes to, and is
mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, in the two great Ends of Trade above-mentioned; (viz) <HI>Employment of
the People, and Con&s;umption of the Produce.</HI> This the <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI> is &s;o far &s;upe|rior
in, to all other Branches of our <HI>Commerce,</HI> as admits of no Compari&s;on; and
therefore the principal Concern of the Nation is, and ought to be the <HI>Woollen Manufacture.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, Prudence may &s;o guide, as that this Concern for the <HI>Woollen Manufacture,</HI>
tho' it be with a Preference to all our other Goods, yet may not be in Oppo&s;ition to
them; there being a manife&s;t Difference between, &s;hewing a peculiar Regard to one, and
injuring the other; as a Man having many Children, may &s;hew a peculiar Affection
to his elde&s;t, without injuring the re&s;t: But then, on the other hand, neither mu&s;t
any of the other Branches of Trade claim or expect &s;uch a Regard or Concern to be
&s;hewn to them, as &s;hould be injurious to the <HI>Woollen Manufactures.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Silk</HI> Trade is u&s;eful and advantageous, but <HI>Silk</HI> is a modern <HI>Manufacture,</HI> and
is u&s;eful and advantageous, as it is a Return for, and encourages the Exportation of
the <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> and no otherwi&s;e: The <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI> is the Elde&s;t
Child of the Nation's <HI>Commerce:</HI> The <HI>Silk</HI> Trade is a Fo&s;ter-Child taken into the
Family, made u&s;eful and meriting to be encouraged, but always with a Sub&s;erviency
to the Good of the Heir.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Turky</HI> Merchants drive any con&s;iderable Trade to <HI>France</HI> with raw <HI>Silk,</HI> whe|ther
from <HI>England</HI> by Re-Exportations, or from the <HI>Levant</HI> directly; the <HI>Silk</HI> they car|ry,
it is allowed, mu&s;t be the Product of <HI>Engli&s;h Manufactures;</HI> &s;o that by that Method,
not only our own <HI>Silks,</HI> but, even the <HI>French Silks</HI> al&s;o, as to the Materials they are
made of, are the Product and Return of the <HI>Engli&s;h Woollen Manufactures.</HI> The next
Difference is the Workman&s;hip, which lies thus, that one is perform'd by the <HI>French,</HI>
whom we ought to have no Regard to in Trade; the other is perform'd by our own
People, whom we ought to &s;upport.</P>
<P>But granting this; if on the other hand, a Bale of wrought <HI>Silks</HI> &s;hould be brought
from <HI>France,</HI> bought there with a Bale or Bales of <HI>Spani&s;h Cloth,</HI> or other <HI>Woollen
Goods,</HI> it is ea&s;y to prove that it is more our Intere&s;t to bring over that Bale of wrought
<HI>Silk;</HI> and that the &s;aid wrought <HI>Silks</HI> are more our own <HI>Manufacture,</HI> than if they
had been wrought in <HI>Spittle-Fields;</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> which were fir&s;t
&s;ent to <HI>Turky</HI> to purcha&s;e the raw <HI>Silk,</HI> which this Bale of <HI>Silks</HI> was wrought from,
and the <HI>Spani&s;h Cloths</HI> or other <HI>Woollen Goods</HI> &s;ent to <HI>France</HI> to purcha&s;e the &s;aid <HI>Silks,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
when wrought, not only con&s;umed the Growth of <HI>England,</HI> but employed above Six|teen
times the Number of People in their making, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> more than the Bale of wrought
<HI>Silks</HI> would have done, if they had been made in <HI>Spittle-Fields.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand, this implies no Danger at all to the <HI>Engli&s;h Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Silk,</HI>
becau&s;e tho' the Humours and Fancies of &s;ome expen&s;ive People may run them upon buy|ing
Foreign wrought <HI>Silks,</HI> yet while the high Duties here remain as they are to do by
the <HI>Treaty,</HI> the Difference of Price will be always &s;uch as will le&s;&s;en the Demand of
Foreign <HI>Silks,</HI> re&s;train the Humour afore&s;aid to a few People, and pre&s;erve the Bulk
of the <HI>Manufacture</HI> in our hands.</P>
<P>It is objected by &s;ome, That the Difference is not &s;ufficient; that notwith&s;tanding
12 <HI>l. 3 s. 7 d.</HI> to be paid upon the Importation for every 20 Pound Weight of wrought
<HI>Silks,</HI> yet that the <HI>French</HI> will bring in their <HI>Silks.</HI> But this amounts to no more than
this (viz) That they will bring in &s;ome few: Which is what as above, may be to
our Advantage. But they will not pretend, that the Difference of the &s;aid Duty &s;hall
not le&s;&s;en that Importation, and reduce it to a &s;mall Quantity, and that the Gro&s;s of
the Trade &s;hall remain in our own hands.</P>
<P>The Sub&s;tance of the Petitions of the <HI>Silk Weavers,</HI> and of others who pretend to ap|pear
in their Behalf, is in &s;hort this, That the Importation of <HI>French</HI> wrought <HI>Silks</HI>
may be prevented: The Pretence to make their Petitioning national, is the Danger,
they &s;ay appears, that <HI>French</HI> wrought <HI>Silks</HI> will now, by Virtue of <HI>the Treaty of Com|merce,</HI>
be imported in great Quantities into <HI>Britain,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> being able to un|der-work
us, will al&s;o Under-&s;ell us, and the Weavers thereby be ruin'd.</P>
<P>What Foundation there is to &s;upport the&s;e Things, will appear, upon making a few
Enquiries into matters of Fact; and &s;ome ju&s;t Calculation of the Proportions of one to
the other.</P>
<P>The Affairs of the high Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ies upon wrought <HI>Silks</HI> Imported, is given in An&s;wer to
the <HI>Weavers,</HI> and &s;eems to make their Apprehen&s;ions appear very irrational: Above
31<HI>s. per Pound</HI> Duty on the Importation mu&s;t be paid upon <HI>Alamodes</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;trings,</HI> and
above 12<HI>s. per Pound</HI> upon all other wrought <HI>Silks;</HI> except <HI>Italian Silks</HI> Imported in <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
Ships, which pay Duty 10 <HI>s. 6 d.</HI></P>
<P>The Force of Rea&s;on prevailed in the fir&s;t, and the <HI>Weavers</HI> have given it up,
owning at the Bar of the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> that the Difference is &s;ufficient in the <HI>A|lamodes</HI>
and <HI>Lu&s;trings,</HI> and that the <HI>French</HI> can do them no harm there; but it &s;eems they
think 12 <HI>s.</HI> or 10 <HI>s 6 d. per pound</HI> too little upon the other wrought <HI>Silks:</HI> But they ei|ther
did not know, or omitted to take notice, that the Raw <HI>Silk</HI> which tho&s;e <HI>French</HI>
Goods are made of, pays Sixteen <HI>Livres per pound</HI> Duty at the fir&s;t Importation into
<HI>France;</HI> that the wrought <HI>Silks,</HI> when &s;hipp'd again to be brought hither, pay 5<HI>l. per
Cent.</HI> Cu&s;tom <HI>ad Valorem</HI> upon their Exportation, both by the <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664; and that
the other Charges, &s;uch as Tran&s;portation by Land-Carriage to the Ports they are &s;hipp'd
at, Commi&s;&s;ion for <HI>Buying, Fraight, Ri&s;que</HI> of the <HI>Sea,</HI> &amp;c. cannot be &s;o little as 5 <HI>per
Cent.</HI> more. So that here is about 12 <HI>per Cent.</HI> more upon the Value of the Goods to
be added to the Difference of <HI>12s.</HI> or <HI>10s. 6 d. per pound;</HI> all which put together,
makes &s;uch a Weight upon the Foreign wrought <HI>Silks,</HI> and gives &s;uch an Advantage
to the <HI>Engli&s;h Weavers,</HI> that it is wonderful to think they &s;hould complain.</P>
<P>To add to the Conviction of the&s;e Things, it &s;hall be a little examin'd, what effect
this Difference has already had upon the <HI>Silk</HI> Trade; from whence may be E&s;timated
&s;ome thing of what may be expected for the time to come.</P>
<P>The <HI>Weavers</HI> &s;aid Them&s;elves, at the Committee of the Hou&s;e of Commons, that they
make to the Value of Three hundred thou&s;and Pounds every Year, in <HI>Black Silks</HI> only;
whether it be Truth or not, is not ea&s;y to be examined: But in this Ca&s;e, if they al|low
it, we are not to que&s;tion it, for if it be an Error, it is again&s;t them&s;elves; their
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Quantity of other <HI>Silks</HI> they &s;pake of as prodigiou&s;ly great. It cannot be ami&s;s to
ob&s;erve then, what Quantity of Foreign wrought <HI>Silks</HI> have been imported here from
all parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> under our high <HI>Duties,</HI> and &s;ee what Proportion they bear to the
Quantity which the&s;e People &s;ay they make at Home, whether the&s;e Foreign wrought
<HI>Silks</HI> have been <HI>French</HI> or no, is not the Ca&s;e; The <HI>Duties</HI> are near the &s;ame; and as they
are Imported from Countries to which <HI>France</HI> had an open Trade, it is not improbable
many <HI>French Silks</HI> have been among them, and if more has not come in, the Difference
made by the <HI>Duties</HI> have been the apparent and only Rea&s;on, and the &s;ame Rea&s;on
mu&s;t hold good &s;till, as long as the &s;ame <HI>Duties</HI> remain.</P>

<P>All that can be alledged again&s;t this is, to beg the <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> and &s;ay, <HI>That There will
be more Imported now;</HI> but before that can be allowed, they &s;hould &s;hew a good Rea&s;on
why more was not Imported in the&s;e Years above-&s;tated, being the Quantity from <HI>I|taly</HI>
was always much greater, before the rai&s;ing the <HI>Duties</HI> here; and that Rea&s;on
which is good for preventing the Importation from <HI>Italy,</HI> will be good for preventing it
from any other Country.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid again&s;t the Rea&s;on of this, is &s;o little to the Purpo&s;e, and with
&s;uch little Force, that it is worth no Notice, the Facts are &s;o clearly made out, that
they amount even to Demon&s;tration: The high Duties have effectually check'd the im|portation
of wrought <HI>Silks,</HI> and will do &s;o &s;till. If the <HI>French</HI> had their <HI>raw Silks</HI> chea|per
than we have it, how comes it to pa&s;s, that &s;o much weight has been put upon
the <HI>Levant</HI> Company's obtaining a Liberty of Exporting <HI>Raw Silk</HI> from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France?</HI>
which is obtain'd for them by the <HI>Treaty,</HI> and which the Company are now fully &s;a|tisfied,
is &s;ettled to their advantages. If the <HI>French</HI> had <HI>raw Silks</HI> cheaper than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
it would be ab&s;ur'd to &s;pake of our &s;ending <HI>raw Silks</HI> from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France.</HI> Goods
<PB N="12" REF="11">
are &s;hipped from Port to Port, to mend their Market, not to le&s;&s;en their Value; if our
Merchants did not advance the Price, they would never &s;end their Goods abroad.</P>
<P>Not only the <HI>French</HI> have not their raw <HI>Silk</HI> Cheaper than <HI>England;</HI> but on the con|trary,
<HI>England</HI> has their <HI>raw Silks</HI> cheaper than all the World; tho&s;e Countries excep|ted,
who have it of their own; and this will appear, by the great Quantity of <HI>raw
Silk</HI> Exported from <HI>England</HI> to other Countries; as al&s;o of <HI>Mohair Yarn,</HI> which is equal|ly
concern'd in the <HI>Argument;</HI> and the following <HI>Ab&s;tract</HI> of One Year may give a
&s;pecimen.</P>

<P>It would be an unaccountable Trade, if it &s;hould be true, that other Nations had
<HI>Raw Silk</HI> cheaper than we have it, when at the &s;ame time they &s;hould buy &s;uch Quan|tities
of it every Year from us.</P>
<P>If any Nation in the World can have <HI>Raw Silk</HI> cheaper than <HI>England, Italy</HI> may be
thought to be the Place, becau&s;e they have great Quantities (<HI>Sicily</HI> included) of <HI>Silks</HI>
of their own Growth. It will be hard to a&s;&s;ign a Rea&s;on why <HI>Italy,</HI> who have
<HI>Silk</HI> of their own, and with whom our Trade has been always open, &s;hould by our
high Duties be ob&s;tructed from &s;ending their wrought <HI>Silks</HI> to <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> who
buy great Quantities of <HI>Silk</HI> from us, &s;hould not.</P>
<P>As the like Arts have been made u&s;e of to po&s;&s;e&s;s the People with an Opinion, that
the Intere&s;t of <HI>Britain</HI> has been neglected with re&s;pect to the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade, which

done with the like Weakne&s;s, and 'tis hop'd it &s;hall be with the like Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>It is alledged, That the Treaty with <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>Treaty</HI> formerly made with <HI>Por|tugal,</HI>
and no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, are incon&s;i&s;tent with one another; That the Effect of the

our <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> in <HI>Portugal</HI> as it was before the War: <HI>And the like.</HI></P>
<P>It is needful to go back and look into the former State of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade, before
the late <HI>Treaty,</HI> and enquire into the Nature and Rea&s;on of the Alterations, Additions
and Encrea&s;es, which have been Accidents to that Trade, and which have brought it
from what it was, to what it now is; in which, if the Cau&s;es a&s;&s;ign'd for it's Encrea&s;e
are mi&s;taken, the Notions we entertain of &s;uch and &s;uch things endangering its Decrea&s;e,
will appear equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ly groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>Two general and Vulgar Errors, or Mi&s;takes, are entertained among us relating to
the fir&s;t part of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade; (viz) what it was before the <HI>Treaty</HI> with <HI>Portugal;</HI>
and two more relating to what it now is, or will be by rea&s;on of the <HI>Peace.</HI> The Mi|&s;takes
about what it was, are (1) That the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> had prohibited all our <HI>Woolllen Ma|nufactures.</HI>
(2) That the Encrea&s;e of our Trade or Export to <HI>Portugal,</HI> was occa&s;ioned
by, and depended upon the Encrea&s;e of our Demand for Their Wines. Our Mi&s;takes
about what the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade is now, or is like to be, are, (1) That upon our reducing
the Duties of <HI>French Wine</HI> by the <HI>Treaty of Commerce</HI> with <HI>France</HI> to an Equality with the
<HI>Portugue&s;e Wines,</HI> the <HI>Wine</HI> Trade from <HI>Portugal</HI> will be ruined, and we &s;hall import no more.
<PB N="13" REF="12">
(2) That upon this, the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> will immediately prohibit our <HI>Woollen Manufactures;</HI>
and &s;o that great Trade which it is alledged, tho' fal&s;ly too, Exports two Millions Year|ly
in the <HI>Growth</HI> and <HI>Manufacture</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> will be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>If every one of the&s;e may be clearly proved to be Mi&s;takes, and that neither the
things &s;ugge&s;ted, or the Con&s;equences drawn from them, can be &s;upported by Truth
or Rea&s;on, then all our Unea&s;ine&s;s about this <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade; will appear cau&s;ele&s;s and
ill grounded. To do this, there needs no more than to &s;tate Matters of Fact; and
give &s;uch Proofs of every thing as the Ca&s;e will admit.</P>
<P>1. That all our <HI>Woolen Manufactures</HI> were Prohibited before the War, is a Mi&s;take;
and truly this is a Mi&s;take of &s;uch a Nature, &s;o obvious, and &s;o ea&s;y to be confuted,
that it is wonderful it &s;hould be expected by any body to do their Arguments any
Service. It is well known upon the Exchange, and no <HI>Portugal</HI> Merchants of any
long &s;tanding, can be ignorant that the Prohibition was ONLY of our <HI>Medley Cloths,</HI>
which were forbidden not only to be imported there, but to be worn; the Rea&s;ons
whereof al&s;o were a&s;&s;igned, (viz.) Not that they &s;et about the making them there,
as &s;ome alledged, but becau&s;e they found their People forward to run into the <HI>French</HI>
way of Clothing and Dre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, which the Court for many Rea&s;ons thought
fit to prevent. But no Man who has any competent Knowledge of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade,
will pretend that the <HI>Bays, Says, Perpets, Serges, Stuffs, Stockings, Cotions, Plains, Ker&s;eys,</HI>
&amp;c. which were always the Gro&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Exportations to <HI>Portugal,</HI> were ever
under any Prohibition there, or any other of our <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> the <HI>Woollen
Cloths</HI> as above only excepted.</P>
<P>That what is &s;aid here may, as <HI>it is Re&s;olved all things in this Paper &s;hall,</HI> carry it's
Evidence along with it, the Words of the late Treaty with <HI>Portugal</HI> may be produced
for Proof: In the Second Articles after the Proportion between the Cu&s;toms of <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI>
Wines and the Cu&s;tom of <HI>French</HI> Wines is &s;ettled, follow the&s;e Words; <HI>Butt if this
Abatements of Cu&s;toms as is pre&s;umed to be made, &s;hall be after any manner prejudiced or Abo|li&s;hed,
&s;hall be just and lawful for his Sacred Royal Maje&s;ty of</HI> Portugal, <HI>again to forbid the</HI>
WOOLLEN CLOTHS.</P>
<P>From he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ce may be noted al&s;o, that <HI>this part</HI> of the Agreement was not &s;o ab&s;o|lutely
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> laid down, as an E&s;&s;ential of the Treaty between <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Portugal,</HI> without which the Peace of the two Nations could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but Provi&s;ion
was expre&s;ly made in the very Article, that if it &s;hould be ABOLISHED, yet the
Peace &s;hould r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">main entire; only the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> would then be at Liberty if he
thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> make him&s;elf Amend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon <HI>England,</HI> by prohibiting the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> WOOL|LEN
CLOTHS.</P>
<P>The next vulgar Error, or Mi&s;take, which we are led into about the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade,
is, that the Encrea&s;e of our Exports of the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to
<HI>Portugal,</HI> is occa&s;ion'd by, and depends upon the Encrea&s;e of our Demand for their
Wines: This, however ab&s;urd, and in its Nature contrary to the Truth of Fact, is the
thing on which the Argument is made to turn; from which they would infer, that
as our Demand for <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine decrea&s;ed, &s;o will their Demand for our <HI>Manufa|ctures</HI>
decline: And in &s;hort, that if by the coming in of <HI>French</HI> Wines, the <HI>Portugal</HI>
Wine &s;hall be wholly left off, as they vainly &s;ugge&s;t, &s;o will al&s;o the Demand for our
<HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> in <HI>Portugal</HI> cea&s;e, and that Trade be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The People who argue thus, confute them&s;elves in their own Calculations: For
Fir&s;t to magnify the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade, they tell us that we export thither Annually the
Value of Two Millions <HI>Sterling,</HI> mo&s;t of it in the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI>
again&s;t this, give them leave to make their own E&s;timates of the <HI>Wine</HI> we Im|port
from thence, and take the large&s;t Year and the highe&s;t Price they can rea&s;onably
&s;uppo&s;e, the Quantity will not amount to above 8 or 9000 <HI>Ton,</HI> which Account there
<PB N="14" REF="13">
will in the pur&s;uit of this Article, appear Rea&s;on to make great Abatement of too; but
were it &s;o, and account the Wines prime Co&s;t one with another, at 15 <HI>l. per Ton,</HI>
or, <HI>to plea&s;e them,</HI> at 20 <HI>l. per Ton,</HI> which is much above the true Co&s;t in in <HI>Portugal,</HI> they
will not amount to 200,000 <HI>l.</HI> which by their own Account, is le&s;s than one Tenth
part of the Demand for our <HI>Manufactures.</HI> This will very ill make it out that their
Demand for our <HI>Manufactures</HI> is occa&s;ion'd by, and depends upon our Demand for
their Wines; by which they mu&s;t make it appear, that the Nine parts of the Trade de|pend
upon the Tenth, and the greater is occa&s;ioned by the le&s;s, which is an Ab&s;ur|dity
in the very Nature of the thing.</P>
<P>But the matter of Fact is evident, and known to all that have any tolerable Know|ledge
of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade, (viz) That the Encrea&s;e of the Trade to <HI>Portugal,</HI> has
been occa&s;ion'd by the Di&s;covery within the&s;e few Years of the Gold Mines of St.
<HI>Paul</HI> in the <HI>Brazils,</HI> by which an immen&s;e Trea&s;ure is gain'd yearly to the <HI>Portugueze</HI>
Nation, as well as to their King; that by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s means the People in <HI>Brazil</HI> are &s;o in|creas'd
in Wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">th, and the Trade to <HI>Brazil</HI> are &s;o increa&s;ed as a Con&s;equence, that the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">leets which about twelve Years ago, were u&s;ually Twenty-three to Twenty-Eight
Sail of Ships from <HI>Lisbon</HI> to <HI>Brazil,</HI> are now Seventy, Eighty, to a hundred Sail, and
the Exports of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods to <HI>Portugal</HI> are increa&s;ed in Proportion.</P>
<P>This is the true and the only Rea&s;on of the Encrea&s;e of their Demand for <HI>Engli&s;h
Manufactures;</HI> and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s has no more Dependance upon, or is occa&s;ion'd by our De|mand
for their <HI>Wines,</HI> than it depends upon any thing that has no Relation at all to it.</P>
<P>It is very &s;trange to find the Oppo&s;ers of any Argument lay the whole Stre&s;s and
Weight of what they have to &s;ay upon any thing which they are not very &s;ure they
can &s;upport the Truth of. But it is perfectly &s;urprizing to &s;ee Men value them&s;elves
and their Cau&s;e upon Accounts and Calculations which are fraudulent and errone|ous,
known by Them&s;elves to be &s;o, and which they might be &s;ure, in an Age like
this, when Men take nothing upon Tru&s;t, would by inquiring Heads be &s;oon detect|ed
and expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Nothing of this kind can be more wonderful, than what we &s;ee practi&s;ed ju&s;t now
by &s;ome People, in handing about a Paper call'd, <HI>A SCHEME of the Trade between</HI>
England <HI>and</HI> France, in order to make the Trade between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> look
with an A&s;pect to plea&s;e them, and to an&s;wer all the <HI>Romantick</HI> things they have
&s;aid of it; which Paper or SCHEME, was Printed in 1674, and &s;aid to be Sign'd by
&s;everal eminent Merchants of the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Something might be &s;aid to the De&s;ign of that Paper, when it was fir&s;t publi&s;hed,
and to the Per&s;ons who Sign'd it (viz.) <HI>That it was Calculated for a De&s;ign then on
foot, to expo&s;e the Publick Management, and divide the People again&s;t the Court.</HI></P>
<P>It may be proper than for the detecting the Fraud of this <HI>Scheme,</HI> to enter into an Exa|mination
of &s;ome of the Particulars wherein it differs from the true Account of that
Year; which &s;hall be done by giving a brief <HI>Abstract</HI> of the &s;aid <HI>Scheme,</HI> and likewi&s;e
of the true Account from the <HI>Custom Hou&s;e,</HI> as it is now laid before the Honourable
Hou&s;e of Commons by the Commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>By both which it will appear, that the De&s;ign of this Paper, call'd A <HI>SCHEME,</HI>
was then, and the making it publick is now, to le&s;&s;en in the publick Opinion the Va|lue

from <HI>France;</HI> a De&s;ign in it &s;elf di&s;hone&s;t, but much more &s;o from the man|ner
of doing it, as will appear by what follows.</P>
<P>Our Exportat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ons to <HI>France</HI> from <HI>Michaelmas</HI> to <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1668-9, are made by the
Scheme to amount to l. 171, 021. 06. 08, and all the &s;pecies of Goods are re&s;trated
to the&s;e few, (viz.) <HI>Woollen Cloths, Dozens, Ker&s;eys, Ra&s;hes, Penny&s;tones, Cott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ns, Flannels,
Ho&s;e, Bays, Stuffs, Serges,</HI> and <HI>Perpets,</HI> with &s;ome <HI>Petties,</HI> which are Crowded toge|ther
at the Value of 20000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
Two <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> &s;hall contain what is &s;ufficient to &s;ay to this part of it, and nothing
can be de&s;ired to expo&s;e it more.</P>
<P>1: That here is not half of the &s;pecies of Goods named which are every Year Expor|ted

<P>2. That of the &s;pecies of Goods which they have named, they have not &s;et down

<P>The&s;e are &s;uch Tokens of a de&s;ign'd <HI>Collu&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Prevarication,</HI> that nothing of that

<P>If their Imports take in the whole Kingdom, then they have committed two Frauds
in&s;tead of one (1.) In the Quantities: And (2.) In offering to &s;tate the Debtor &s;ide of
the Account upon the Port of <HI>London,</HI> with a Gue&s;s at one Third more of the Out-Ports,
AGAINST all that they &s;ay was Imported in the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>If they had de&s;ign'd a fair and ju&s;t Account, They ought to have &s;tated the Ex|ports
and Imports exactly for the Port of <HI>London,</HI> and have made the Addition of one
Third for the out Ports equal to both &s;ides; and have &s;tated both &s;ides upon the Im|ports
and Exports of the whole Kingdom; For if the Exports exceed the Imports for
the Port of <HI>London</HI> only, as appears by the <HI>Custom-Hou&s;e</HI> Books: It would have been
much more &s;o for the Out-Ports, becau&s;e many of our Out-Ports, which lye in or near
tho&s;e Countries where the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> are made, <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> cured, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Export
much greater Quantities to <HI>France,</HI> than they could con&s;ume the Value of in <HI>French</HI>
Goods, as <HI>Exeter, Colche&s;ter, Yarmouth,</HI> and many other Ports.</P>
<P>But the Prevarications are yet more gro&s;s, and the Value greater; As one part makes the
Exportations to <HI>France</HI> &s;eem le&s;s; &s;o the other as dexterou&s;ly makes the Importa|tions
from <HI>France</HI> &s;eem more: Nor will their making a Gue&s;s or Whol&s;ale Al|lowance
of one Third for the Out-Ports on one &s;ide an&s;wer for it, unle&s;s they had
either made the &s;ame allowance &s;erve on both &s;ides, or extended the Account to the
&s;ame period of Time on both &s;ides without it; but acting fairly did not &s;eem to &s;uit
the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who would &s;upport the Paper call'd <HI>A Scheme,</HI> produce a Paper, &s;aid to be
Signed by the Farmers of the Cu&s;toms, containing an Account of the Importations
of <HI>Wines, Brandies,</HI> and <HI>Linnen</HI> from <HI>France,</HI> from <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1667, to <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1669,
which they make to be very large, and from whence they would argue, that one half
thereof mu&s;t be the Rule of the Year 1669. Had this been a meer Gue&s;s, or had it
been at any other time, the Calculation might have been le&s;s &s;u&s;pected. But there lies
&s;o ju&s;t an Exception again&s;t the Year 1667, and it was &s;o well known to them, that
it cannot be any thing but a meer De&s;ign.</P>
<P>It is well known, the Plague had in the Year 1665 put an univer&s;al &s;top to all
Trade, except &s;uch as Nece&s;&s;ity forc'd the People to, for meer Provi&s;ions. The next
Year the Fire of <HI>London</HI> happen'd; and as the Fire began near the water &s;ide, and a|mong
the Warehou&s;es and Cellars of the Merchants, the Quantities of <HI>Wines</HI> as well
as of other Goods which were &s;poil'd or de&s;troy'd, were very great. Add to this
a War with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> by which the Trade with both was &s;top'd, and which
War was not ended till the Treaty at <HI>Breda</HI> in <HI>July</HI> 1667.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things might well &s;uppo&s;e <HI>England</HI> to be &s;o Exhau&s;ted of <HI>French</HI> Goods, as that
the Importation of the next Year, (viz) 1667, mu&s;t be prodigious great; and no ratio|nal
Judgment can be made of the Trade to or from <HI>France</HI> by the Accounts of that
Year. This is farther demon&s;trated by the Article of the <HI>Brandies</HI> which the Account
<PB N="17" REF="16">
of the Farmers afore&s;aid makes for the &s;aid Two Years to be but 3775 <HI>Ton.</HI> But by an
Account of the &s;ame Farmers for the la&s;t Five Quarters of the &s;aid two Years, (viz.)
from <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1668, to <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1669, the whole Quantity of Brandy Imported,
amounts to no more than 680 <HI>Ton;</HI> and yet the <HI>SCHEME</HI> affirms, there was 4000
<HI>Ton</HI> of <HI>Brandy</HI> Imported from <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1668, to <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1669. And this is of|fer'd
as one undeniable Evidence of the Fraud of that <HI>SCHEME.</HI></P>
<P>There may be a parallel Ca&s;e found out to illu&s;trate this, and that is of the Expor|tation
of <HI>Lead</HI> from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France</HI> in the Year 1662, which amounts to, as by the
<HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e</HI> Books, a mo&s;t prodigious and unu&s;ual Quantity (viz.) From <HI>Michaelmas</HI>
1662, to <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1663, there was Exported from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> 21,757 Fod|der
of <HI>Lead,</HI> which at 12 <HI>l. per Fodder,</HI> as the <HI>Scheme</HI> allows the Price to be, amounts
to 261,084 <HI>l.</HI> It would be acknowledged very unfair, that this &s;hould be given in as
an Article of our u&s;ual Export of Lead to <HI>France;</HI> for, as an extraordinary Year is no
ju&s;t Rule to take a Medium of Calculation from, &s;o no more is the Year 1667, to be
taken as a proper time to Calculate our Importation of <HI>Wine</HI> from <HI>France;</HI> the prece|ding
Accidents of a Plague, the Fire, and the War, joining together to make the De|mand
for Wines that Year extraordinary great.</P>
<P>Perhaps it is a Fate upon us, that the Inconveniencies and Ill-Con&s;equences of re|jecting
a Trade &s;o evidently Beneficial to <HI>England,</HI> mu&s;t be di&s;covered by our Experi|ence,
and mu&s;t be felt before they will be known; in which Ca&s;e this Paper will
have Occa&s;ion not only to mention tho&s;e Inconveniencies before hand, but to remind
you of them when they happen.</P>
<P>This Paper &s;hall al&s;o, in its Cour&s;e, be adapted to the &s;everal Trading Counties and
Towns of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to make appear, that now the War is ended, all the Goods
and Commodities of <HI>France</HI> may be Imported into this Kingdom, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are
to be Re-exported, as <HI>Brandies, Linens, Silks, Paper, Laces,</HI> &amp;c. Since upon &s;uch Re-exportation
all the additional Duties are drawn back; when at the &s;ame time not
one Yard of the <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which are all prohibited in
<HI>France,</HI> nor of our <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> and other material Commodities, can be Imported into <HI>France,</HI>
the Articles not being made effectual.</P>
<P>The In&s;tances of this, &s;hall be hereafter e&s;pecially applyed to the particular Trading
places of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who will thereby be able to judge whether this is not the
true State of their Ca&s;e, and whether the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Flemings</HI> will now have the Im|portation
of our <HI>Manufactures</HI> into <HI>France,</HI> as they have had for above 20 Years la&s;t
pa&s;t, and re&s;erve to them&s;elves the <HI>Dre&s;&s;ing, Dying</HI> and <HI>Fini&s;hing</HI> of tho&s;e Goods;
whereby the <HI>Manufacturers</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> will become Slaves to Foreigners, who
will either &s;et their own Price upon our <HI>Manufactures,</HI> or &s;et up Fabricks of their
own in Imitation of them, all which might have been avoided, by having an open
and direct Trade with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>This Paper &s;hall not &s;ugge&s;t &s;o much Unhappine&s;s to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who&s;e general
Good it is de&s;ign'd to promote, as to propo&s;e that the Articles of <HI>Commerce</HI> &s;hall not
in time to come be farther con&s;ider'd. The Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> who are the true
Judges of their Countries Good, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to omit any thing that &s;hall be
apparently for the publick Advantage; and therefore when it &s;hall appear to them
which we will not que&s;tion, that the&s;e Articles are proper to be Re-con&s;ider'd, they
will no doubt, act therein, as Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice requires.</P>
<P>In the mean time, &s;eeing we are to carry on our Trade without the Advantages
which were expected from the <HI>Treaty,</HI> let us enquire upon what Terms we are to
carry it on, and how we &s;hall Trade with <HI>France</HI> for the time coming.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tariff</HI> of 1664 is now no more to be mentioned in this Affair: The low Du|ties
which our Goods would have paid in <HI>France,</HI> are out of the Que&s;tion. The Edict
of 1701 mu&s;t now be the Rule of our Trade in <HI>France:</HI> And that this may be un|der&s;tood

that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade was the only De&s;tructive thing to the Indu&s;try of the <HI>French</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Arguments</HI> are &s;o pungent, and carry with them &s;o much Weight, that it makes
a mo&s;t pointed <HI>Satyre</HI> upon the <HI>French</HI> King, that he &s;hould not comply with their
De&s;ires; but it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that if their Rea&s;ons are ju&s;t on the <HI>French</HI> &s;ide,
it will be hard to find that our Complaints of this Trade can be rea&s;onable on the o|ther
&s;ide; for it is hardly Rational to &s;ugge&s;t, that the Trade between the&s;e Two Na|tions
can be to the Di&s;advantage and Lo&s;s on both &s;ides</P>
<P>Many Delu&s;ions have been &s;pread about to amu&s;e and deceive the People in this
Matter of the <HI>Treaty of Commerce</HI> with <HI>France;</HI> &s;ome of which have been Detected and
duly Expo&s;ed, and many who have been Deceived by them begin to recover their
Judgments, and to find that the <HI>Treaty</HI> which they have been prevail'd upon to Reject
and Contemn, is really a Foundation of the mo&s;t advantageous Commerce that <HI>Britain</HI>
can be engaged in; That the <HI>French</HI> mu&s;t Trade with us under the mo&s;t di&s;advan|tageous
Conditions imaginable; That our Export will be ea&s;y to us, their Imports here
hard and Loaden with Burthens to them; and we begin to &s;ee the&s;e People now
repent the Oppo&s;ition they have all along made to their Countries Good, and would
undo what others have done if it was in their Power to do &s;o.</P>
<P>But there are &s;till Mi&s;takes behind, which mu&s;t be removed, and Objections which
however they may be ill-grounded, yet require &s;ome Notice of them; as e&s;pecially
this (viz) That there are but three Ports in <HI>France</HI> at which our <HI>Manufactures</HI> are ad|mitted
to be Imported, (viz.) St. <HI>Vallery</HI> on the <HI>Soame, Roan,</HI> and <HI>Bourdaux.</HI> It is won|derful
to reflect how much this prevails in the Minds of the People, con&s;idering it is
evident that the limiting the Ports for Entry, concern only the two Species, (viz.)
the <HI>Cloths</HI> and <HI>Cloth-Serges,</HI> which is plain by the Specifications of the <HI>Treaty,</HI> and not
all the re&s;t of our <HI>Woollen Manufactures.</HI> But as to all our other <HI>Woollen Manufactures,
Bays, Says, Serges, Perpets, Stuffs, Druggets, Dozens, Ker&s;ies, Stockings,</HI> &amp;c. All our Re-exported
Goods, &s;uch as <HI>Cottons, Indicoes, Sugars, Ea&s;t-India</HI> and <HI>Turky</HI> Goods, and all
other, they are f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eely allow'd by the <HI>Treaty</HI> to be Imported into all the Ports of <HI>France;</HI>
and before this <HI>Treaty,</HI> the &s;aid two &s;pecies of <HI>Manufactures</HI> were confined to but Two
Ports, (viz.) <HI>Calais,</HI> and St. <HI>Vallery</HI> on the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the Rea&s;on why the <HI>French</HI> Confined our &s;aid <HI>Woollen Manufa|ctures</HI>
to certain Ports for their Importations was, that the Land Carriage and Local
Duties of the &s;aid Goods &s;hould ri&s;e &s;o h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">gh upon them, that the Price &s;hould thereby be
made too great for the Buyer, and give the advantage to their own <HI>Manufactures.</HI> Let
&s;uch People but look Back upon their Own <HI>Arguments,</HI> they are not only fal&s;e in them|&s;elves,
but incon&s;i&s;tent with one another; for if this were true, then it mu&s;t be true
al&s;o, that their own <HI>Manufactures</HI> &s;tood in need of tho&s;e Helps; that their own <HI>Manu|factures</HI>
were &s;o Inferiour to the <HI>Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h</HI> that if the utmo&s;t Di&s;couragements were not put
upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods, the <HI>French Manufactures</HI> would not be told, that the <HI>Engli&s;h Ma|nufactures</HI>
&s;o excelled the <HI>French,</HI> in the real intrin&s;ick Value, that if the&s;e were ad|mitted,
tho' upon the harde&s;t Terms to be Imported into <HI>France,</HI> yet they would gain
Ground there; and to be brief, would Sell before the <HI>French,</HI> albeit the Difference
made by the Burthen of Duties there, was at that time above 40 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and the&s;e
things they will not allow, having on many Occa&s;ions publi&s;hed that the <HI>French Ma|nufactures</HI>
are as good as Ours, and if permitted to come into <HI>England,</HI> would ruin our
own.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
But on the other hand, this &s;ugge&s;tion cannot in general be True; for had it been
&s;o that the limiting the Importation of the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> to a few cer|tain
Ports, was contriv'd to Load the &s;aid Goods with the farther Burthens of Land-carriage,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Why then &s;hould the Ports they were limited to, be cho&s;en out upon
the greate&s;t Navigable Rivers in <HI>France,</HI> neare&s;t to the Place where the Centre of their
Trade lay, and where the chief Con&s;umption of our <HI>Manufactures</HI> was to be expect|ed.
For Example; <HI>Roan</HI> and <HI>Bourdeaux.</HI> The City of <HI>Roven</HI> lies on the River <HI>Sein,</HI>
and is to <HI>Paris</HI> as <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> is to <HI>London:</HI> From thence the Navigation of the <HI>Sein</HI>
conveys every thing by Water upon Five great Rivers, (viz) by the <HI>Oy&s;e</HI> and the
<HI>Ai&s;ne</HI> into the I&s;le of <HI>France</HI> and the lower <HI>Champain</HI> to the City of <HI>Rhiemes,</HI> the <HI>Rhe|telois</HI>
and the Edge of the Dutchy of <HI>Bar;</HI> by the River <HI>Maza</HI> through the whole Pro|vince
of <HI>Champain,</HI> by the <HI>Yonne</HI> into <HI>Burgundy</HI> and <HI>Nivernois,</HI> and by the River <HI>Loyng</HI>
and the <HI>Canal de Briare</HI> into the great River <HI>Loyre</HI> to the Cities of <HI>Orleans, Nevers, Blais
Tours, Angers,</HI> &amp;c. even down to the <HI>Occean,</HI> and through the very Heart of <HI>France:</HI>
Again the City of <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> is the Centre of the <HI>Engli&s;h Commerce</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and where
the greate&s;t Number of our Ships re&s;ort for the <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Brandies</HI> which are brought
from thence, Therefore appointing <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> as one of the Ports for the Import of
our <HI>Manufactures,</HI> was rather making the Trade ea&s;y than difficult to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and
&s;o far from a de&s;ign of making our Goods dear, and encrea&s;ing the Charges upon them,
that it was rather giving Ea&s;e to it by opening that only Port to which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could
bring them upon the ea&s;ie&s;t Terms of <HI>Fraight,</HI> and where the greate&s;t Demand for
tho&s;e Goods was to be found; where the principal Con&s;umption of them might be
excepted, and where the greate&s;t Convenience of <HI>Ireland</HI> Navigation was to be had,
in order to convey the &s;aid <HI>Manufactures</HI> to all Parts of the Kingdom of <HI>France:</HI> For
the City of <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> &s;tands on the <HI>Garonne,</HI> from whence they have a Navigation by
other Rivers; (viz.) the <HI>Dordonne</HI> quite through <HI>Perigott</HI> and <HI>Limo&s;in</HI> into <HI>Auvergne;</HI>
by the River <HI>Lot</HI> through <HI>Quercy</HI> and <HI>Rovergne</HI> even to the <HI>Sevennes,</HI> and by the Royal
Canal from the City of <HI>Thoulou&s;e</HI> on the <HI>Garonne</HI> quite through the Province of <HI>Lan|guedoc</HI>
to <HI>Narbonne,</HI> and into the mediterranean Sea; &s;upplying the whole Provinces of
<HI>Ga&s;coign, Guienne,</HI> and <HI>Languedock</HI> with <HI>Briti&s;h Manufactures</HI> by Water Carriage.</P>
<P>This rather &s;eems to intimate to us, that the <HI>French</HI> King finding it convenient on
other Accounts to limit the Importation of the&s;e Goods to certain Ports, yet appoin|ted
tho&s;e Ports &s;o, as that his Subjects might have the Goods brought with the great|e&s;t
Ea&s;e and the lea&s;t Charge that could be to tho&s;e Markets, where the greate&s;t Con|&s;umption
of them was, and where the Principal Traders in tho&s;e Goods were &s;ettled;
who from thence &s;upplyed the whole Kingdom by the Convenience of Water-Carriage:
As to the Rea&s;on of naming particular Ports and Places for the Importation of the&s;e
Goods, it is known to tho&s;e who are acquainted with the Affairs of <HI>France, That it
was occa&s;ioned by the differing Circum&s;tances of the Contracts with the Farmers,</HI> and was a
thing practi&s;ed in other Ca&s;es in <HI>France</HI> as well as in this of the <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI>
as particularly the <HI>Drugs</HI> and <HI>Spices</HI> which are limited in almo&s;t the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>Al&s;o this limiting the Importation of Goods to certain Ports, is not a new Practice
or peculiar to <HI>France</HI> only; the like is done in <HI>England,</HI> particularly the <HI>Alamodes</HI> and
<HI>Lu&s;trings,</HI> are confined to the Port of <HI>London;</HI> and the Importation of <HI>Wooll</HI> from <HI>Ireland</HI>
is limited to Three or Four Ports only, but however is &s;o ordered, not that the <HI>Iri&s;h
Wooll</HI> &s;hould by Rea&s;on of Land-Carriage be made dearer to our <HI>Manufactures</HI> than the
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in order to di&s;courage the Importation of it; But for other particular Rea&s;ons,
drawn from the Circum&s;tances of the thing it &s;elf; and therefore the Towns to which
the Importations of <HI>Iri&s;h Wooll</HI> is limited are &s;uch, as are not only neare&s;t and mo&s;t con|venient
by their Situation for the coming from <HI>Ireland,</HI> but neare&s;t and mo&s;t conveni|ent
to tho&s;e parts of <HI>England</HI> where the <HI>Manufacturers</HI> live, who make u&s;e of <HI>Iri&s;h Wooll,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="21">
and are the principal Buyers and Con&s;umers thereof; as <HI>Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ead</HI> for the <HI>Serge-Ma|kers</HI>

<P>Had not the Convenience of the <HI>Manufacturers</HI> been con&s;ulted in this Limitation,
but on the contrary, had it been contrived or appointed on purpo&s;e to add the Burthen
and Expence of Land-Carriage to the Price of the <HI>Wooll, Bri&s;toll</HI> might have been na|med,

of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, would yet have greatly encrea&s;ed the Price of the <HI>Wooll</HI> to the
<HI>Manufacturers,</HI> by the Charges of carrying it on Hor&s;eback after it was landed; in like
manner had the King of <HI>France</HI> limited the Importation of the <HI>Engli&s;h&punc; Manufactures</HI>
with De&s;ign, as it is alledged, to Enhance the Price by Land-Carriage, he would have
cho&s;en &s;uch Ports for their Importation as were mo&s;t remote from tho&s;e Parts, where the
principal Con&s;umptions of them was known to be, and mo&s;t remote from the Conveniences
of Water-Carriage: This was very ea&s;y for him to have done, had he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">amed the Cities
of <HI>Rochell</HI> and St. <HI>Mall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> for Example, in&s;tead of <HI>Roan</HI> and <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> the Ca&s;e had been
qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e altered, there being no River Navigable near them; and then it would have
been difficult to have a&s;&s;igned any other Rea&s;on for &s;uch Limitation, than that of
Di&s;couraging and Burthening the Trade: But as it is now, there is no room for any
Suppo&s;ition of that kind.</P>
<P>Further it might be demanded why the <HI>French</HI> King &s;hould not rather lay &s;till high|er
D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ties on the &s;aid <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> than &s;tudy to rai&s;e their Price by the Diffi|culties
of their Importation; the former being the readie&s;t Method of Di&s;cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ging
their Market, and which would at the &s;ame time have brought in &s;ome Gain to the
Crown, which is an Article they are far from being forgetful of in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid in Di&s;cour&s;ing on this Subject, about the Ballance of the <HI>French</HI>
Trade being again&s;t <HI>England:</HI> That the Ballance formerly again&s;t <HI>England</HI> has been Di&s;pu|ted,
and that with good Rea&s;on; the contrary in many Particulars evidently appearing;
But that the Ballance will be again&s;t <HI>England</HI> NOW, is too evident; for it is impo&s;&s;ible
to be otherwi&s;e: the Nature of the Trade will not permit it to be otherwi&s;e; The <HI>French</HI>
will bring in great Quantities of their Goods here, of which &s;ome will always be
con&s;umed at home, what Price &s;oever they co&s;t; and all that we want for Re-Expor|tation,
whether to our own Colonies or other Parts will go abroad, drawing back
the high Duties, which, as it is alledged, are to hinder our Trading in them. So that
&s;till all our Foreign <HI>Commerce,</HI> &s;o far as the&s;e Kind of <HI>Goods</HI> are Demanded, will be <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Again&s;t this, it is demanded, how mu&s;t Payment be made? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">all our Trade to <HI>France</HI>
is in &s;ome Re&s;pect prohibited, as has been &s;hewn by the Edict of 1701, publi&s;hed
MERCATOR (No. 13.) and what is not prohibited is loaded with &s;uch high Duties,
as are almo&s;t equal to a Prohibition: We have been told that we pay for all the Goods
we buy in <HI>France</HI> with ready Money, whether we did or no BEFORE may be debated
another time, but it is evident that we &s;hall buy NOW; the Articles not being made
Effectual, mu&s;t be paid for with Money, or not paid for at all; for the <HI>French</HI> will take
nothing of us. So that they having formerly &s;hut the Door of <HI>Commerce</HI> again&s;t <HI>En|gland,</HI>
we have bolted it now on the wrong &s;ide, and will not &s;uffer them to open it
again, altho' they are willing to do it.</P>
<P>If the Ballance of Trade by this means runs again&s;t <HI>Britain,</HI> which before always ran
again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> we cannot blame them, but mu&s;t blame our &s;elves, who have been wil|ling
to have it &s;o, and have &s;o blamed our Party-Intere&s;t with our Trading-Intere&s;t,
as to ruin the one, in order to carry on the other.</P>
<P>The Objection upon which all this Matter &s;eem'd to turn, has been, that the <HI>French</HI>
have NOW all kinds of <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> of their own making, and have no
need of our Trade; this is carryed &s;uch a Length by &s;ome, that they in&s;i&s;t, that the
<PB N="23" REF="22">
<HI>French</HI> make all the &s;orts of our <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> as good as the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and much
cheaper than they can be made here; that they are able not only to &s;upply them&s;elves
but other Countries, nay all Countries &s;ays one Author; and <HI>Britain</HI> too, &s;ays another
Author: But it would be ask'd of the&s;e warm People, <HI>Why then do they &s;o &s;trictly and
carefully Exclude, Prohibit, or Load with Duties, all the</HI> Engli&s;h Woollen Manufactures? If
their own are better and cheaper than the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> their Quality would be a Prohibition
as effectual as an Edict or <HI>Arrest du Con&s;eil,</HI> and much more, and other Prohibitions
would be needle&s;s.</P>
<P>But whatever we are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, the <HI>French</HI> know better, and as they have good
Rea&s;on to be mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the Defects of their own <HI>Manufactures,</HI> &s;o they are very
careful to keep the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods out, that the Goodne&s;s of one again&s;t the Meanne&s;s
of the other, may not be di&s;covered by the Trade it &s;elf: Nothing can be a more un|deniable
Proof of the Mi&s;take of tho&s;e People who talk &s;o warmly of the Goodne&s;s and
Cheapne&s;s of the <HI>French Manufactures,</HI> than the <HI>French</HI> King laying &s;uch repeated Bur|thens
upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods; and after this was done, and &s;everal times encrea&s;ed,
yet, when the <HI>Manufacturers</HI> there found, that notwith&s;tanding their high Duties and
Burthens, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods would be bought by their People, whatever they co&s;t, be|ing
recommended &s;o effectually by their own Worth and Goodne&s;s, that all the <HI>French</HI>
could do in the meer way of Trade would be of no Signification to it, They Petitioned
the <HI>French</HI> King to grant a Total Prohibition of <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> which he did:
And this was all done during a Time of Peace; &s;o that the War is not the Rea&s;on of
this Ca&s;e, but the meer Nature of the Trade, and it is ea&s;y to be di&s;covered that it
had been to &s;mall Purpo&s;e to go about making <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> if the
<HI>Engli&s;h Woollen Manufactures</HI> were not effectually Prohibited.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty, on the other hand, has &s;o effectually &s;ecur'd to her Subjects all the
Advantages of the <HI>French</HI> Trade, that &s;he has not only obtain'd the Revocation of all
that the King of <HI>France</HI> had been doing for 50 Years, for the Encouragement of his
Subjects in the <HI>Woollen Manufactures,</HI> by which &s;he gives her own People a full Oppor|tunity
to extend their Trade into all parts of <HI>France</HI> with Advantage, but on the con|trary,
has continued upon the <HI>French</HI> Importations hither, all tho&s;e Inequalities and
extraordinary Duties which were needful to exclude them from any prejudicial Ex|ce&s;&s;es
in <HI>England</HI> to the Di&s;advantage of her own People: By both which the Ballance
of that Trade is effectually &s;ecured to be on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ide, and we are in a fair way
to recover all the Injury done to our <HI>Commerce</HI> by the la&s;t impungent Prohibitions.</P>
<P>Would the&s;e People turn the Tables and make this Ca&s;e their own, what may we
&s;uppo&s;e they would &s;ay if the Queen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> had, in Her Maje&s;ty's <HI>Treaty of
Commerce,</HI> Con&s;ented to take off the high Duties laid on the Importation of tho&s;e <HI>French
Manufactures,</HI> which our People have been Encouraged by tho&s;e high Duties to make
here, and given Permi&s;&s;ion by this <HI>New Treaty</HI> to the <HI>French,</HI> to Import the &s;aid Goods
upon the low Duties, which the &s;ame Goods paid here before the Year, 1664. <HI>For
Example,</HI> Should the Duties on <HI>French Alamodes</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;trings</HI> have been reduced to
6 <HI>s. per l.</HI> which they paid before the War, in&s;tead of 31 s. 10 d. which they are to

as we find the <HI>French</HI> Merchants and <HI>Manufactures</HI> in <HI>France</HI> have done on their &s;ide to
their King, and for which we mu&s;t acknowledge they have very good Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>It is &s;carcely worth while to mention here, much le&s;s to give an An&s;wer to a Re|port
very Confidently &s;pread about, and which &s;ome people are weak enough to take

<P>They mu&s;t be no <HI>Manufacturers</HI> them&s;elves, nor much concern'd for tho&s;e who are,
or for the <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> in general, who can read this Table with|out
<PB N="25" REF="24">
being &s;en&s;ible of the Di&s;advantage our Trade lyes under in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation
of our Commerce with <HI>France:</HI> When they &s;hall Read the Word <HI>Prohibited</HI> continually
before every <HI>Article</HI> of our <HI>Woollen Manufacture,</HI> and &s;hall remember, that for Twelve
Years pa&s;t, none of all tho&s;e Goods have been admitted into <HI>France</HI> but by way of
<HI>Holland;</HI> whereas very great Quantities of <HI>Woollen Manufactures</HI> were Yearly Expor|ted
thither before, be&s;ides other Goods of the Growth and Production of our own
Country, or of our Plantations, which is the &s;ame thing, and ought &s;o to be e&s;teem|med.</P>
<P><HI>When
the QUEEN,</HI> who always had the Good of Her Subjects, and the Pro&s;perity of
their Commerce at Her Heart, <HI>found it was in Her Power to open &s;uch a Door of Trade
to Her People,</HI> on Terms &s;o much to the Lo&s;s and Di&s;advantage of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;o evident|ly
to the Advantage of Her own Kingdoms; <HI>it could not but be with great Satisfaction,
that Her Maje&s;ty gave in Charge to Her Mini&s;ters and Plenipotentiaties,</HI> to Conclude
a Treaty, which took off all the Burthens and Prohibitions, which the Mi&s;takes of former
Years had brought upon the Trade, and by which Her Enemies were obliged to make deep
Wounds in their own Trade, to comply with tho&s;e Demands.</P>
<P>But, it mu&s;t be very di&s;obliging to the QUEEN, as well as very &s;urprizing to her
Faithful Subjects, to &s;ee in what manner <HI>&s;ome People</HI> receive, and how di&s;ingeniou&s;ly
they Con&s;true <HI>all Her Maje&s;ty's Endeavours to &s;hew Her affectionate Concern for the Welfare
of Her Subjects, and the Pro&s;perity of Their Commerce;</HI> as if that very Care, which Her
Maje&s;ty has &s;o Eminently expre&s;s'd, <HI>for Their Good,</HI> was a Contrivance of Her and
their Enemies, to betray us to the <HI>French,</HI> and to give up the <HI>Briti&s;h Intere&s;t in Trade,</HI> to
the mo&s;t dangerous Rivals they have in the World.</P>
<P>Certainly Mankind cannot be &s;o far carried away with the &s;tream of their Pa&s;&s;ions,
as to deny this general Maxim; <HI>That nothing ought to be believed in &s;uch publick Debates
as the&s;e, but what is proved.</HI> This <HI>Paper</HI> has from its beginning, taken this for a Rule,
<HI>and therefore brings Authentick Proofs with it, of every Thing it &s;ays, yet the&s;e Men &s;ay it is
all Lies;</HI> on the contrary, <HI>they bring no</HI> Proof <HI>at all of what they &s;ay, and yet they expect
to be believed.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;horten the <HI>Di&s;pute,</HI> the <HI>MERCATOR</HI> &s;hall as mode&s;tly as the <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> will allow
make a fair Challenge to all <HI>Oppo&s;ers;</HI> which if they do not An&s;wer, they can but ill
Ju&s;tify any of their future <HI>Objections</HI> again&s;t the Truth of what is alledg'd in this Pa|per.</P>
<P>The
<HI>Challenge</HI> is&punc; <HI>That whereas they charge this Paper with Lying,</HI> they ought to de|&s;cend
to Particulars; and &s;tating it truly, <HI>let the World know what ONE THING it
is the MERCATOR has Affirm'd, A&s;&s;erted, made Publick as Truth, which is not &s;o:</HI>
If this cannot be done, <HI>the charge of Lying will turn back upon them, with great Di&s;ad|vantage
to them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>One Condition only mu&s;t be de&s;ir'd of them, (viz.) <HI>That they will not expect any thing
&s;hould be taken upon Trust on one &s;ide more than on the other;</HI> and therefore that they will
be careful, as the MERCATOR has always done, to quote their Authorities for all they
&s;hall &s;ay; the Validity of which, when Confronted with tho&s;e of this Paper, may be
ea&s;ily examined, and the <HI>Readers</HI> may judge whether are in the Right; if they do not
think fit to do this, as the MERCATOR will not think it worth while to take any
Notice of them, &s;o neither can they expect it of any one el&s;e.</P>
<P>That their <HI>Scheme</HI> of which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oa&s;ted, is it &s;elf one general Complication of
Fraud; and fal&s;e Repre&s;entations has been made appear, even to both Hou&s;es of Par|liament;
The MERCATOR in that, as in every other Ca&s;e of like Nature, &s;ays no|thing
from him&s;elf, but &s;pakes the Language of the <HI>Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e</HI> Books, gives exact
Copies of the Commi&s;&s;ioners Reports, &s;ign'd under their Hands, and proves every thing
in particular by Authentick Papers; if the&s;e are fal&s;e, the MERCATOR would be
<PB N="26" REF="25">
very willing to &s;ee the Proof of it; if any mi&s;take has happened, whether wilful or
by the negligence of Clerks, the Books are remaining, and may be referr'd to: Why
do not the&s;e People tell us where the&s;e Mi&s;takes lye? why do they not prove that the
MERCATORS has made fal&s;e Draughts of tho&s;e Accounts and Reports? omitted any
thing or added any thing to make his Arguments appear the Better; as on the other
Hand has been proved to be their practice, even in a mo&s;t &s;candalous manner, in their
late SCHEME, under the hands of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the <HI>Cu&s;toms,</HI> and by them
Laid before both Hou&s;es of Parliament.</P>
<P>All the u&s;e this Paper &s;hall make of this unfair U&s;age, is only to proceed with
the &s;ame Caution in all that it &s;hall make publick, &s;till taking care to offer nothing
but what is &s;ufficiently confirm'd by &s;uch Authorities, as &s;hall always &s;tand the Te&s;t
of the &s;tricte&s;t Examination; taking no notice of any thing which &s;hall be &s;aid in
Oppo&s;ition to it, unle&s;s it comes likewi&s;e &s;upported by &s;uch Proofs as may give a due
Weight, and make it rea&s;onable to be Inquired into.</P>
<P><HI>But to return to the Subject of Trade, from which as few Digre&s;&s;ions as po&s;&s;ible, &s;hall be
made in this</HI> Paper.</P>
<P>The la&s;t MERCATOR gave a true Pro&s;pect of the State of one Branch of our Trade in
<HI>France</HI> as it now &s;tands, and as it might now have &s;tood, had the <HI>Treaty</HI> taken place, that
is to &s;ay, <HI>the Branch of Trade which concerns our</HI> Woollen Manufactures <HI>in particular.</HI>
The <HI>Manufacturers</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> may there &s;ee what Circum&s;tances they are now in
as to <HI>Trade,</HI> and what their unnatural Joy is built upon which they have &s;o publickly
&s;hewn at the Delay of the Advantages which they might by this time have rafted of
in their Trade.</P>
<P>Next to the &s;aid Exportation of our <HI>Woollen Manufacture,</HI> the <HI>Fi&s;hing Trade</HI> is our im|mediate
Concern, and that more e&s;pecially &s;ince our <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Scotland:</HI> The <HI>Northern</HI>
Parts of <HI>Britain</HI> have a peculiar Intere&s;t in the <HI>Fi&s;hery,</HI> and the &s;ecuring a Market in
<HI>France</HI> for the great Quantities of <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> that are or may be Cured in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in the
<HI>North,</HI> and <HI>West</HI> parts of <HI>England,</HI> is of &s;o great Con&s;equence to this Nation, that it can|not
be omitted in a <HI>Treaty of Commerce.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> had not forgotten this part, or to encourage their own Subjects to launch
into the <HI>Fi&s;hery</HI> as well as into the other Branches of our <HI>Trade:</HI> The high Duties in
<HI>France</HI> laid upon <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> from <HI>Great Britain, were an effectual Support to the</HI> French <HI>Projects
of</HI> Fi&s;hing, <HI>and a Bar to the</HI> Fi&s;hing of Great Britain: For <HI>Scotland</HI> by the <HI>Union</HI> being
brought into the &s;ame Prohibitions, and being e&s;teemed as the &s;ame Nation, came
thereby al&s;o under <HI>the &s;ame Inconveniencies of Trade,</HI> and <HI>lost the Advantage of their Trade
to</HI> France, which before was very con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially in <HI>Fi&s;h; Scotland</HI> having al|ways
before the <HI>Union,</HI> Exported to <HI>France</HI> yearly, a very great Quantity of <HI>Herring, Salmon</HI> and white <HI>Fi&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot but be grateful to all tho&s;e Parts of <HI>Britain</HI> which are &s;en&s;ible of the <HI>Benefit</HI>
of the <HI>Fi&s;hery,</HI> and who depend <HI>upon the Exportation of the</HI> Fi&s;h <HI>when taken,</HI> to under&s;tand
<HI>That the Importation of our</HI> Fi&s;h <HI>into</HI> France <HI>is now, by this</HI> Treaty, <HI>left open upon very ea&s;y
Terms,</HI> and particularly, <HI>upon the &s;ame Terms with the</HI> Dutch; which could never be ob|tained
before.</P>
<P>The ju&s;t Care and Concern which Her Maje&s;ty has &s;hewn for the Intere&s;t of Her
own Subjects, and the Extent of their Commerce, has been &s;een in removing that
Inequality, and providing that our Fi&s;hery &s;hall now be upon the &s;ame Foot with
that of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and have the &s;ame Encouragement of an open Trade to <HI>France;</HI> a
thing which however the <HI>Dutch</HI> have Taught us to reject here, they always took care
to &s;ecure for them&s;elves, and found no little advantage in it.</P>
<P>The Merchants and Gentlemen of the <HI>North</HI>-part of <HI>Britain,</HI> and of the <HI>We&s;t</HI> al&s;o,
have frequently expre&s;s'd to the Government their great Concern for the obtaining
<PB N="27" REF="26">
this Liberty of Commerce; and the great Advantages which it would be to them, if
obtain'd; as may be &s;een by the <HI>Repre&s;entation</HI> of the Royal Buroughs in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for|merly
&s;ent up to the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade; and of others al&s;o: And unle&s;s
we could &s;uppo&s;e them to Act in Contradiction to them&s;elves, it mu&s;t be a particular
Satisfaction to them all, to &s;ee what provi&s;ion Her Maje&s;ty has made for the &s;aid <HI>Fi|&s;hing-Trade</HI>
by this <HI>Treaty;</HI> and it mu&s;t be impo&s;&s;ible, without an Infatuation, which it
would be rude to &s;ugge&s;t, that the Merchants and Trading People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> of the
<HI>North</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> of the Coa&s;ts about <HI>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">mouth</HI> and <HI>Loe&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ff,</HI> or the Counties of <HI>Corn|wall</HI>
and <HI>Devon,</HI> can be drawn into &s;ay, <HI>they are pleas'd that the Articles of this Treaty re|main
Ineffectual.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus often mention'd <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the <HI>Fi&s;hing-Trade,</HI> it is proper al&s;o to take
notice how, by the pre&s;ent Treaty, Her Maje&s;ty made it Her e&s;pecial Care, in behalf
of Her <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects as well as <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to have all tho&s;e new Burthens which were
laid upon the <HI>Briti&s;h Fi&s;hing Trade</HI> only, and which gave that Trade away from us to
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> taken away in <HI>France;</HI> and as it is very &s;urprizing, that the Power of any
Party-Influence, &s;hould make us in <HI>England</HI> in&s;en&s;ible of &s;uch advantages. So the next
Paper &s;hall let you &s;ee what tho&s;e Advantages are, and that they are not equally di&s;|regarded
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as they are here.</P>
