<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS relation is Matter of Fact, and attended with &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances as may induce any Rea&s;onable Man to believe it. It was &s;ent by a Gentleman, a Ju&s;tice of Peace at <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and a very Intelligent Per&s;on, to his Friend in <HI>London,</HI> as it is here Worded; which Di&s;cour&s;e is atte&s;ted by a very &s;ober and under&s;tanding Gentlewoman, a Kin&s;woman of the &s;aid Gen|tlemans, who lives in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> within a few Doors of the Hou&s;e in whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> the within named Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> lives; who believes his Kin&s;woman to be of &s;o di&s;cerning a Spirit, as not to be put upon by any Fallacy, and who po&s;&s;itively a&s;&s;ured him, that the whole Matter, as it is here Related and laid down, is what is really True; and what She her &s;elf had in the &s;ame Words (as near as may be) from Mrs. <HI>Bargraves</HI> own Mouth, who &s;he knows had no Rea&s;on to Invent and publi&s;h &s;uch a Story, nor any de&s;ign to forge and tell a Lye, being a Woman of much Hone&s;ty and Vir|tue, and her whole Life a Cour&s;e as it were of Piety. The u&s;e which we ought to make of it is, to con&s;ider, That there is a Life to come after this, and a Ju&s;t God, who will retribute to every one according to the Deeds done in the Body; and therefore, to reflect upon our Pa&s;t cour&s;e of Life we have led in the World; That our Time is Short and &V;ncertain, and that if we would e&s;cape the Puni&s;hment of the Ungodly, and receive the Reward of the Righteous, which is the laying hold of Eternal Life, we ought for the time to come, to turn to God by a &s;peedy Repentance, cea&s;ing to do Evil and Learning to do Well: To &s;eek after God Early, if happily he may be found of us, and lead &s;uch Lives for the future, as may be well plea&s;ing in his &s;ight.</P>

<HEAD>A RELATION OF THE APPARITION Of Mrs. VEAL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS thing is &s;o rare in all its Circum&s;tances, and on &s;o good Authority, that my Reading and Conver&s;ation has not given me any thing like it; it is fit to gratifie the mo&s;t Ingenious and Serious Enquirer. Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> is the Per&s;on to whom Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> Appeared after her Death; &s;he is my Intimate Friend, and I can avouch for her Reputation, for the&s;e la&s;t fifteen or &s;ixteen Years, on my own Knowledge; and I can confirm the Good Character &s;he had from her Youth, to the time of my Acquaintance. Tho' &s;ince this Relation, &s;he is Calumniated by &s;ome People, that are Friends to the Brother of Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> who Ap|peared; who think the Relation of this Appearance to be a Reflecti|on, and endeavour what they can to Bla&s;t Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI>'s Reputa|tion; and to Laugh the Story out of Countenance&punc; But the Circum|&s;tances thereof, and the Chearful Di&s;po&s;ition of Mrs. <HI>Bargrave,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the unheard of ill U&s;age of a very Wicked Husband, there is not the lea&s;t &s;ign of Dejection in her Face; nor did I ever hear her let fall a De&s;ponding or Murmuring Expre&s;&s;ion; nay, not when actually under her Husbands Barbarity; which I have been Witne&s;s to, and &s;everal other Per&s;ons of undoubted Reputation.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">Now you mu&s;t know, that Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> was a Maiden Gentlewoman of about 30 Years of Age, and for &s;ome Years la&s;t pa&s;t, had been troubled with Fits; which were perceived coming on her, by her going off from her Di&s;cour&s;e very abruptly, to &s;ome impertinence: She was maintain'd by an only Brother, and kept his Hou&s;e in <HI>Dover.</HI> She was a very Pious Woman, and her Brother a very Sober Man to all appearance: But now he does all he can to Null or Qua&s;h the Story. Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> was intimately acquainted with Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> from her Childhood. Mrs <HI>Veals</HI> Circum&s;tances were then Mean; her Fa|ther did not take care of his Children as he ought, &s;o that they were expo&s;ed to Hard&s;hips: And Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> in tho&s;e days, had as Unkind a Father, tho' She wanted for neither Food nor Cloathing, whil&s;t Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> wanted for both: So that it was in the Power of Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> to be very much her Friend in &s;everal In&s;tances, which mightily endear'd Mrs <HI>Veal</HI>; in&s;omuch that &s;he would often &s;ay, Mrs. <HI>Bargrave you are not only the Be&s;t, but the only Friend I have in the World; and no Circum&s;tances of Life, &s;hall ever di&s;&s;olve my Friend&s;hip.</HI> They would often Condole each others adver&s;e Fortune, and read together, <HI>Drelincourt upon Death,</HI> and other good Books: And &s;o like two Chri&s;tian Friends, they comforted each other under their Sorrow.</P>
<P>Sometime after, Mr. <HI>Veals</HI> Friends got him a Place in the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e at <HI>Dover,</HI> which occa&s;ioned Mrs <HI>Veal</HI> by little and little, to fall off from her Intimacy with Mrs. <HI>Bargrave,</HI> tho' there was never any &s;uch thing as a Quarrel; but an Indifferency came on by degrees, till at la&s;t Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> had not &s;een her in two Years and a half; tho' above a Twelve Month of the time, Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> had been ab&s;ent from <HI>Dover,</HI> and this la&s;t half Year, has been in <HI>Canterbury</HI> about two Months of the time, dwelling in a Hou&s;e of her own.</P>
<P>In this Hou&s;e, on the Eighth of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, <HI>viz</HI> 1705. She was &s;itting alone in the Forenoon, thinking over her Unfortunate Life, and arguing her &s;elf into a due Re&s;ignation to Providence, tho' her condition &s;eem'd hard. And &s;aid &s;he, <HI>I have been provided for hither|to, and doubt not but I &s;hall be &s;till, and am well &s;atisfied, that my Af|flictions &s;hall end, when it is mo&s;t fit for me:</HI> And then took up her Sewing-Work, which &s;he had no &s;ooner done, but &s;he hears a Knock|ing at the Door; &s;he went to &s;ee who it was there, and this prov'd to be Mrs. <HI>Veal,</HI> her Old Friend, who was in a Riding Habit: At that Moment of Time, the Clock &s;truck Twelve at Noon.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">Madam &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Bargrave,</HI> I am &s;urprized to &s;ee you, you have been &s;o long a &s;tranger, but told her, &s;he was glad to &s;ee her and offer'd to Salute her, which Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> complyed with, till their Lips almo&s;t touched, and then Mrs <HI>Veal</HI> drew her hand cro&s;s her own Eyes, and &s;aid, <HI>I am not very well,</HI> and &s;o waved it. She told Mrs. <HI>Bargrave,</HI> &s;he was going a Journey, and had a great mind to &s;ee her fir&s;t: But &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Bargrave, how came you to take a Journey alone? I am amaz'd at it, becau&s;e I know you have &s;o fond a Brother.</HI> O! &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Veal, I gave my Brother the Slip, and came away, becau&s;e I had &s;o great a Mind to &s;ee you before I took my Journy.</HI> So Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> went in with her, into another Room within the fir&s;t, and Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> &s;at her &s;elf down in an Elbow-chair, in which Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> was &s;itting when &s;he heard Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> Knock. Then &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Veal, My Dear Friend, I am come to renew our Old Friend&s;hip again, and to beg your Pardon for my breach of it, and if you can forgive me you are one of the be&s;t of Women.</HI> O! &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Bar|grave, don't mention &s;uch a thing, I have not had an unea&s;ie thought about it, I can ea&s;ily forgive it.</HI> What did you think of me &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Veal?</HI> Says Mrs. <HI>Bargrave, I thought you were like the re&s;t of the World, and that Pro&s;perity had made you forget your &s;elf and me.</HI> Then Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> reminded Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> of the many Friendly Offices &s;he did her in former Days, and much of the Conver&s;ation they had with each other in the time of their Adver&s;ity; what Books they Read, and what Comfort in particular they received from <HI>Drelincourt</HI>'s, <HI>Book of Death,</HI> which was the be&s;t &s;he &s;aid on that Sub|ject, was ever Wrote. She al&s;o mentioned Dr. <HI>Sherlock,</HI> and two <HI>Dutch</HI> Books which were Tran&s;lated, Wrote upon Death, and &s;everal others: But <HI>Drelincourt</HI> &s;he &s;aid, had the cleare&s;t Notions of Death, and of the Future State, of any who have handled that Subject. Then &s;he asked Mrs. <HI>Bargrave,</HI> whether &s;he had <HI>Drelincourt</HI>; &s;he &s;aid yes. Says Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> fetch it, and &s;o Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> goes up Stairs, and brings it down. Says Mrs. <HI>Veal,</HI> Dear Mrs. <HI>Bargrave, If the Eyes of our Faith were as open as the Eyes of our Body, we &s;hould &s;ee numbers of Angels about us for our Guard: The Notions we have of Heaven now, are nothing like what it is, as</HI> Drelincourt <HI>&s;ays. Therefore be comforted under your Afflictions, and believe that the Almighty has a particular regard to you; and that your Afflictions are Marks of Gods Favour: And when they have done the bu&s;ine&s;s they were &s;ent for, they &s;hall be removed from you.</HI> And believe me my Dear Friend, believe what I &s;ay to you, <HI>One Minute of future Happine&s;s will infinitely reward you for
<PB N="4" REF="6">
all your Sufferings. For I can never believe,</HI> (and claps her Hand upon her Knee, with a great deal of Earne&s;tne&s;s, which indeed ran through all her Di&s;cour&s;e) <HI>that ever God will &s;uffer you to &s;pend all your Days in this Afflicted State: But be a&s;&s;ured, that your Afflictions &s;hall leave you, or you them in a &s;hort time.</HI> She &s;pake in that Pathetical and Hea|venly manner, that Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> wept &s;everal times; &s;he was &s;o deeply affected with it. Then Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> mentioned Dr. <HI>Hornecks A&s;cetick,</HI> at the end of which, he gives an account of the Lives of the Primitive Chri&s;tians. <HI>Their Pattern &s;he recommended to our Imitation</HI>; and &s;aid, <HI>their Conver&s;ation was not like this of our Age. For now</HI> (&s;ays &s;he) <HI>there is nothing but frothy vain Di&s;cour&s;e, which is far different from theirs. Theirs was to Edification, and to Build one another up in the Faith: So that they were not as we are, nor are we as they are; but</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>We might do as they did. There was a Hearty Friend&s;hip among them, but where is it now to be found?</HI> Says Mrs. Bargrave, <HI>'tis hard indeed to find a true Friend in the&s;e days.</HI> Says Mrs. <HI>Veal,</HI> Mr. <HI>Norris</HI> has a Fine Coppy of Ver&s;es, call'd <HI>Friend&s;hip in Perfection,</HI> which I wonderfully admire, have you &s;een the Book &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI>? No, &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Bargrave, but I have the Ver&s;es of my own writing out. Have you,</HI> &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Veal, then fetch them</HI>; which &s;he did from above Stairs, and offer'd them to Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> to read, who refu&s;ed, and wav'd the thing, &s;aying, <HI>holding down her Head would make it ake,</HI> and then de&s;ired Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> to read them to her, which &s;he did. As they were admiring Friend&s;hip, Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> &s;aid, Dear Mrs. <HI>Bar|grave,</HI> I &s;hall love you for ever: In the Ver&s;es, there is twice u&s;ed the Word <HI>Ely&s;ium.</HI> Ah! &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Veal, The&s;e Poets have &s;uch Names for Heaven.</HI> She would often draw her Hand cro&s;s her own Eyes; and &s;ay, Mrs. <HI>Bargrave Don't you think I am mightily impaired by my Fits?</HI> No, &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Bargrave,</HI> I think you look as well as ever I knew you.</P>
<P>After all this di&s;cour&s;e, which the Apparition put in Words much finer than Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> &s;aid &s;he could pretend to, and was much more than &s;he can remember (for it cannot be thought, that an hour and three quarters Conver&s;ation could all be retained, tho' the main of it, &s;he thinks &s;he does.) She &s;aid to Mrs. <HI>Bar|grave, &s;he would have her write a Letter to her Brother, and tell him, &s;he would have him give Rings to &s;uch and &s;uch; and that there was a Pur&s;e of Gold in her Cabinet, and that &s;he would have Two Broad Pieces given to her Cou&s;in Wat&s;on.</HI> Talking at this Rate, Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> thought that a Fit was coming upon her, and &s;o placed
<PB N="5" REF="7">
her &s;elf in a Chair, ju&s;t before her Knees, to keep her from fal|ling to the Ground, if her Fits &s;hould occa&s;ion it; for the Elbow Chair &s;he thought would keep her from falling on either &s;ide. And to divert Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> as &s;he thought, &s;he took hold of her Gown Sleeve &s;everal times, and commended it. Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> told her, it was a Scower'd Silk, and newly made up. But for all this Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> per&s;i&s;ted in her Reque&s;t, and told Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> &s;he mu&s;t not deny her: and &s;he would have her tell her Brother all their Conver&s;ation, when &s;he had an opportunity. Dear Mrs. <HI>Veal,</HI> &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Bargrave, this &s;eems &s;o impertinent, that I cannot tell how to comply with it; and what a mortifying Story will our Conver&s;ation be to a Young Gentleman?</HI> Well, &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Veal, I mu&s;t not be deny'd.</HI> Why, &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Bargrave, 'tis much better methinks to do it your &s;elf,</HI> No, &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Veal; tho' it &s;eems im|pertinent to you now, you will &s;ee more rea&s;on for it hereafter.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> then to &s;atisfie her importunity, was going to fetch a Pen and Ink; but Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> &s;aid, <HI>let it alone now, and do it when I am gone; but you mu&s;t be &s;ure to do it:</HI> which was one of the la&s;t things &s;he enjoin'd her at parting; and &s;o &s;he promi&s;ed her.</P>
<P>Then Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> asked for Mrs. <HI>Bargraves</HI> Daughter; &s;he &s;aid &s;he was not at home; but if you have a mind to &s;ee her &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Bargrave,</HI> I'le &s;end for her. <HI>Do,</HI> &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Veal.</HI> On which &s;he left her, and went to a Neighbours, to &s;end for her; and by the Time Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> was returning, Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> was got without the Door in the Street, in the face of the <HI>Bea&s;t-Market</HI> on a Saturday (which is Market day) and &s;tood ready to part, as &s;oon as Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> came to her. She askt her, <HI>why &s;he was in &s;uch ha&s;t?</HI> &s;he &s;aid, <HI>&s;he mu&s;t be going; tho' perhaps &s;he might not go her journey till Monday.</HI> And told <HI>Mrs.</HI> Bargrave <HI>&s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould &s;ee her again, at her Cou&s;in</HI> Wat&s;ons <HI>before &s;he went whether &s;he was a going.</HI> Then &s;he &s;aid, <HI>&s;he would not take her Leave of her,</HI> and walk'd from Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> in her view, till a turning interrupted the &s;ight of her, which was three quarters after One in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> Dyed the 7th of <HI>September</HI> at 12 a Clock at Noon, of her Fits, and had not above four hours Sen&s;es before her Death, in which time &s;he received the Sacrament. The next day after Mrs. <HI>Veals</HI> appearing being Sunday, Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> was mightily indi&s;po&s;ed with a Cold, and a Sore Throat, that &s;he could not
<PB N="6" REF="8">
go out that day: but on Monday morning &s;he &s;ends a per&s;on to Captain <HI>Wat&s;ons</HI> to know if Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> were there. They won|dered at Mrs. <HI>Bargraves</HI> enquiry, and &s;ent her Word, that &s;he was not there, nor was expected. At this An&s;wer Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> told the Maid &s;he had certainly mi&s;took the Name, or made &s;ome blunder. And tho' &s;he was ill, &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> put on her Hood, and went her &s;elf to Captain <HI>Wat&s;ons,</HI> tho' &s;he knew none of the Family, to &s;ee if Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> was there or not. They &s;aid, they wonder|ed at her asking, for that &s;he had not been in Town; they were &s;ure, if &s;he had, &s;he would have been there. Says Mrs. <HI>Bargrave, I am &s;ure &s;he was with me on Saturday almo&s;t two hours.</HI> They &s;aid it was impo&s;&s;ible, for they mu&s;t have &s;een her if &s;he had. In comes Captain <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI> while they were in Di&s;pute, and &s;aid that Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> was certainly Dead, and her E&s;cocheons were ma|king. This &s;trangely &s;urpri&s;ed Mrs. <HI>Bargrave,</HI> who went to the Per&s;on immediately who had the care of them, and found it true. Then &s;he related the whole Story to Captain <HI>Wat&s;ons</HI> Family, and what Gown &s;he had on, and how &s;triped. And that Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> told her it was Scowred. Then Mrs. <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> cry'd out, <HI>you have &s;een her indeed, for none knew but</HI> Mrs. <HI>Veal and my &s;elf, that the Gown was Scowr'd</HI>; and Mrs <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> own'd that &s;he de&s;cribed the Gown exactly; for, &s;aid &s;he, <HI>I helpt her to make it up.</HI> This, Mrs. <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> blaz'd all about the Town, and avouch'd the De|mon&s;tration of the Truth of Mrs. <HI>Bargraves</HI> &s;eeing Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI>'s Apparition. And Captain <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> carried two Gentlemen im|mediately to Mrs. <HI>Bargraves</HI> Hou&s;e, to hear the Relation from her own Mouth. And then it &s;pread &s;o fa&s;t, that Gentlemen and Per&s;ons of Quality, the Judicious and Sceptical part of the World, flock't in upon her, which at la&s;t became &s;uch a Task, that &s;he was forc'd to go out of the way. For they were in general, extreamly &s;atisfyed of the truth of the thing; and plain|ly &s;aw, that Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> was no Hypochondriack, for &s;he al|ways appears with &s;uch a chearful Air, and plea&s;ing Mien, that &s;he has gain'd the favor and e&s;teem of all the Gentry. And its thought a great favor if they can but get the Relation from her own Mouth. I &s;hould have told you before, that Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> told Mrs. <HI>Bargrave,</HI> that her Si&s;ter and Brother in Law, were ju&s;t come down from <HI>London</HI> to &s;ee her. Says Mrs. <HI>Bargrave, how came you to order matters &s;o &s;trangely? it could not be helpt &s;aid</HI> Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI>; and her Si&s;ter and Brother did come to &s;ee her, and
<PB N="7" REF="9">
entred the Town of <HI>Dover,</HI> ju&s;t as Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> was expiring. Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> asked her, whether &s;he would not drink &s;ome Tea. Says Mrs. <HI>Veal, I do not care if I do: But I'le Warrant this Mad Fellow</HI> (meaning Mrs. <HI>Bargraves</HI> Husband,) <HI>has broke all your Trinckets.</HI> But, &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Bargrave, I'le get &s;omething to Drink in for all that</HI>; but Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> wav'd it, and &s;aid, <HI>it is no matter, let it alone,</HI> and &s;o it pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>All the time I &s;at with Mrs. <HI>Bargrave,</HI> which was &s;ome Hours, &s;he recollected fre&s;h &s;ayings of Mrs. <HI>Veal.</HI> And one material thing more &s;he told Mrs. <HI>Bargrave,</HI> that Old Mr. <HI>Breton</HI> allowed Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> Ten pounds a Year, which was a &s;ecret, and unknown to Mrs. <HI>Bar|grave,</HI> till Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> told it her. Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> never varies in her Story, which puzzles tho&s;e who doubt of the Truth, or are unwilling to believe it. A Servant in a Neighbours Yard adjoining to Mrs. <HI>Bargraves</HI> Hou&s;e, heard her talking to &s;ome body, an hour of the Time Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> was with her. Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> went out to her next Neighbours the very Moment &s;he parted with Mrs. <HI>Veal,</HI> and told what Ravi&s;hing Conver&s;ation &s;he had with an Old Friend, and told the whole of it. <HI>Drelincourt</HI>'s <HI>Book of Death</HI> is, &s;ince this happened, Bought up &s;trangely. And it is to be ob&s;erved, that notwith&s;tand|ing all this Trouble and Fatigue Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> has undergone upon this Account, &s;he never took the value of a Farthing, nor &s;uffer'd her Daughter to take any thing of any Body, and therefore can have no Intere&s;t in telling the Story.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Veal</HI> does what he can to &s;tifle the matter, and &s;aid he would &s;ee Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI>; but yet it is certain matter fact, that he has been at Captain <HI>Wat&s;ons</HI> &s;ince the Death of his Si&s;ter, and yet never went near Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI>; and &s;ome of his Friends report her to be a great Lyar, and that &s;he knew of Mr. <HI>Breton</HI>'s Ten Pounds a Year. But the Per&s;on who pretends to &s;ay &s;o, has the Reputation of a Notorious Lyar, among per&s;ons which I know to be of undoubted Repute. Now Mr. <HI>Veal</HI> is more a Gentleman, than to &s;ay &s;he Lyes; but &s;ays, a bad Husband has Craz'd her. But &s;he needs only to pre&s;ent her &s;elf, and it will effectually confute that Pretence. Mr. <HI>Veal</HI> &s;ays he ask'd his Si&s;ter on her Death Bed, whether &s;he had a mind to di&s;po&s;e of any thing, and &s;he &s;aid, No. Now what the things which Mrs. <HI>Veals</HI> Apparition would have di&s;po&s;ed of, were &s;o Trifling, and nothing of Ju&s;tice aimed at in their di&s;po&s;al, that the de|&s;ign of it appears to me to be only in order to make Mrs.
<PB N="8" REF="10">
<HI>Bargrave,</HI> &s;o to demon&s;trate the Truth of her Appearance, as to &s;atisfie the World of the Reality thereof, as to what &s;he had &s;een and heard: and to &s;ecure her Reputation among the Rea|&s;onable and under&s;tanding part of Mankind. And then again, Mr. <HI>Veal</HI> owns that there was a Pur&s;e of Gold; but it was not found in her Cabinet, but in a Comb-Box This looks impro|bable, for that Mrs. <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> own'd that Mrs. <HI>Veal</HI> was &s;o very careful of the Key of her Cabinet, that &s;he would tru&s;t no Bo|dy, with it. And if &s;o, no doubt &s;he would not tru&s;t her Gold out of it. And Mrs. <HI>Veals</HI> often drawing her hand over her Eyes, and asking Mrs. <HI>Bargrave,</HI> whether her Fits had not impair'd her; looks to me, as if &s;he did it on purpo&s;e to remind Mrs. <HI>Bar|grave</HI> of her Fits, to prepare her not to think it &s;trange that &s;he &s;hould put her upon Writing to her Brother to di&s;po&s;e of Rings and Gold, which lookt &s;o much like a dying Per&s;ons Beque&s;t; and it took accordingly with Mrs. <HI>Bargrave,</HI> as the effect of her Fits coming upon her; and was one of the many In&s;tances of her Won|derful Love to her, and Care of her, that &s;he &s;hould nor be affright|ed: which indeed appears in her whole management; particularly in her coming to her in the day time, waving the Salutation, and when &s;he was alone; and then the manner of her parting, to pre|vent a &s;econd attempt to Salute her.</P>
<P>Now, why Mr. <HI>Veal</HI> &s;hould think this Relation a Reflection, (as 'tis plain he does by his endeavouring to &s;tifle it) I can't imagine, becau&s;e the Generality believe her to be a good Spirit, her Di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o Heavenly. Her two great Errands were to comfort Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> in her Affliction, and to ask her Forgivene&s;s for her Breach of Friend|&s;hip, and with a Pious Di&s;cour&s;e to encourage her. So that after all, to &s;uppo&s;e that Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> could Hatch &s;uch an Invention as this from <HI>Friday-Noon,</HI> till <HI>Saturday-Noon,</HI> (&s;uppo&s;ing that &s;he knew of Mrs. <HI>Veals</HI> Death the very fir&s;t Moment) without jumbling Cir|cum&s;tances, and without any Intere&s;t too; &s;he mu&s;t be more Witty, Fortunate, and Wicked too, than any indifferent Per&s;on I dare &s;ay, will allow. I asked Mrs. <HI>Bargrave</HI> &s;everal times, <HI>If &s;he was &s;ure &s;he felt the Gown.</HI> She an&s;wered Mode&s;tly, <HI>if my Sen&s;es be to be relied on, I am &s;ure of it.</HI> I asked her, <HI>If &s;he heard a Sound, when &s;he clapt her Hand upon her Knee:</HI> She &s;aid, <HI>&s;he did not remember &s;he did:</HI> And &s;he &s;aid, <HI>&s;he Appeared to be as much a Sub&s;tance as I did, who talked with her. And I may</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>be as &s;oon per&s;uaded that your Apparition is talking to me now, as that I did not really &s;ee her; for I was under no
<PB N="9" REF="11">
manner of Fear, I received her as a Friend, and parted with her as &s;uch. I would not,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>give one Farthing to make any one believe it, I have no Intere&s;t in it; nothing but trouble is entail'd upon me for a long time for ought that I know; and had it not come to Light by Accident, it would never have been made Publick</HI> But now &s;he &s;ays, <HI>&s;he will make her own Private &V;&s;e of it, and keep her &s;elf out of the way as much as &s;he can.</HI> And &s;o &s;he has done &s;ince. She &s;ays, <HI>&s;he had a Gentleman who came thirty Miles to her to hear the Relation; and that &s;he had told it to a Room full of People at a time.</HI> Several particular Gentlemen have had the Story from Mrs <HI>Bargraves</HI> own Mouth.</P>
<P>This thing has very much affected me, and I am as well &s;atisfied, as I am of the be&s;t grounded Matter of Fact. And why &s;hould we di&s;pute Matter of Fact, becau&s;e we cannot &s;olve things, of which we can have no certain or demon&s;trative Notions, &s;eems &s;trange to me: Mrs. <HI>Bargraves</HI>'s Authority and Sincerity alone, would have been un|doubted in any other Ca&s;e.</P>
