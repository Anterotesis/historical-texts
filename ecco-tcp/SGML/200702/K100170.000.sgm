<HEAD>THE Grumbletonians; OR, THE DOGS without-Doors.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>_A Wealthy Farmer in the We&s;t,</L>
<L>With Life's Enjoyments amply ble&s;t,</L>
<L>A Man e&s;teem'd both far and near,</L>
<L>Who in his Hou&s;e kept &s;pecial Beer;</L>
<L>Twelve Children eke around his Table,</L>
<L>All lu&s;ty, lively, brisk and able:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He carried wondrous well his Age,</L>
<L>His Wife was Hou&s;ewifely and Sage;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="3">
They throve, and pick'd up Wealth apace,</L>
<L>And none at Church of them took Place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Two Ma&s;tiff Dogs he kept, to guard</L>
<L>His Hou&s;e, his Poultry, and his Yard;</L>
<L>With Offal from the Meat he kill'd,</L>
<L>Their hungry Paunches well he fill'd:</L>
<L>All &s;leek they were, and in good Ca&s;e,</L>
<L>And &s;hew'd the Plenty of the Place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But in the Hou&s;e they dur&s;t not enter,</L>
<L>My Dame her Crock'ry would not venture;</L>
<L>For &s;he had Tea-Table, and China,</L>
<L>And held her Head as high as any:</L>
<L>Her Hou&s;e was kept too nice and neat</L>
<L>For Dogs to traip&s;e with dirty Feet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For many Years the&s;e Currs were quiet,</L>
<L>Nor grumbled at their Bounds or Diet,</L>
<L>Would bark at Beggar or at Stranger,</L>
<L>And make much Noi&s;e at little Danger;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4">
But, to the Comers too and fro,</L>
<L>No Marks of Surline&s;s they'd &s;hew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Hound the Farmer had be&s;ide,</L>
<L>A Hound! His Hearts delight and Pride;</L>
<L>Peerle&s;s he was of all his Kind,</L>
<L>So fleet! he would out-&s;trip the Wind,</L>
<L>The be&s;t that ever follow'd Game,</L>
<L>Frolick he was, and FLY his Name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Care&s;t and lov'd by ev'ry Soul,</L>
<L>He rang'd the Hou&s;e without Controul;</L>
<L>This made the angry Ma&s;tiffs jealous,</L>
<L>FLY &s;hould be rais'd above his Fellows:</L>
<L>Keep his No&s;e warm and lick the Plates,</L>
<L>While they &s;tood &s;hiv'ring at the Gates.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They grudge each Bit that goes be&s;ide 'em,</L>
<L>And vow Revenge what e'er betide 'em;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5">
In &s;hort &s;o wond'rous fell they grew,</L>
<L>At Friend and Foe they fiercely flew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The&s;e ugly Currs kept &s;uch a Rout,</L>
<L>That no one dur&s;t &s;tir in or out;</L>
<L>To quiet them their Ma&s;ter try'd,</L>
<L>But they his Threats and Him defy'd:</L>
<L>Their Fury would not be abated,</L>
<L>They bark'd the more, the more he rated;</L>
<L>And made &s;uch a confounded Din,</L>
<L>He thought 'twas be&s;t to let 'em in:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For why, their Noi&s;e di&s;turb'd the Head</L>
<L>Of my good Dame, now &s;ick a-bed;</L>
<L>So, rather than her Head &s;hould ake,</L>
<L>He let 'em in for Quiet's &s;ake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But le&s;t their Rage on him &s;hould fall,</L>
<L>He wi&s;ely rais'd his Plowmen all,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="6">
With Prong, and Fork, and Bill in Hand,</L>
<L>The&s;e furious Creatures to with&s;tand;</L>
<L>But for this Caution was no need,</L>
<L>As by the Sequel you may read:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For &s;oon as e'er the Door was ope,</L>
<L>They both into the Kitchen crope,</L>
<L>Wagging their Tails, all tame and mild,</L>
<L>As harmle&s;s Lamb, or &s;ucking Child.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The&s;e Currs who were &s;o fierce before,</L>
<L>Now crouch and wriggle on the Floor;</L>
<L>Fawn at the very Servants Feet,</L>
<L>And tremble le&s;t they &s;hould be beat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next they traver&s;e the Kitchen round,</L>
<L>To &s;ee what Prog is to be found;</L>
<L>Where, having fed to Hearts de&s;ire,</L>
<L>They &s;tretch'd them&s;elves before the Fire,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7">
Content and &s;nug they lay till broad day Light,</L>
<L>The Hou&s;e was &s;till, my Dame &s;lept well that Night.</L>
