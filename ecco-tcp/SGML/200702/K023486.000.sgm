</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Pa&s;&s;age of Scripture is under&s;tood,
by all Chri&s;tian Interpreters, to refer
to the Days of the Go&s;pel. The Prophet is
de&s;cribing in the Context the Influence of the
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>'s Reign, extending thro' all Nature,
and producing univer&s;al Happine&s;s. This, in
its full Accompli&s;hment, doubtle&s;s, is yet fu|ture,
and re&s;pects &s;ome more advanced Period
<PB N="2" REF="3">
of the Kingdom of God, foretold in other Pa&s;|&s;ages
of the prophetick Writings; when true
Religion &s;hall univer&s;ally prevail, and the na|tive
Tendency of the Go&s;pel attain its entire
Effect. In the Pro&s;pect of this, the Prophet
&s;eems to ri&s;e above him&s;elf, and celebrates tho&s;e
happy Days in the mo&s;t &s;ublime, figurative
Strain of Ea&s;tern Poetry. He opens a beau|tiful
View of the State of the World, as a State
of returning Innocence. He repre&s;ents all Na|ture
flouri&s;hing in Peace; Di&s;cord and Guile
aboli&s;hed; the mo&s;t ho&s;tile Natures reconciled,
and the mo&s;t &s;avage tamed and reformed. <HI>The
Wolf al&s;o &s;hall dwell with the Lamb; and the
Leopard &s;hall ly down with the Kid: And the
Calf and the young Lion, and the Fatling toge|ther,
and a little Child &s;hall lead them. And the
Cow and the Bear &s;hall feed, their young Ones
&s;hall ly down together; and the Lion &s;hall eat
Straw like the Ox; and the &s;ucking Child &s;hall
play on the Hole of the A&s;p, and the weaned Child
&s;hall put his Hand on the Cockatrice Den. They
&s;hall not hurt nor de&s;troy in all my holy Moun|tain:
For</HI> (a&s;&s;igning in the Text the Cau&s;e of
this great and happy Revolution) <HI>the Earth &s;hall
be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Wa|ters
cover the Sea.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">
UPON reading the&s;e Words, we mu&s;t imme|diately
perceive the great <HI>Encouragement</HI> they
give to all good De&s;igns, for promoting Reli|gion
in the World. When we engage in this
Cau&s;e, we have the Comfort, not only of be|ing
engaged in a <HI>good</HI> Cau&s;e, but al&s;o in one
that will undoubtedly be <HI>&s;ucce&s;sful.</HI> For we
are here a&s;&s;ured, by the Divine Promi&s;e, that
Truth and Goodne&s;s &s;hall at length prevail,
and the increa&s;ing Light and Influence of
Religion prove the Cau&s;e of general Order
and Happine&s;s. It is a noble and animating
Thought, that, in &s;uch De&s;igns, we co-ope|rate
with God for advancing the Kingdom of
the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and work upon his Plan with all
the Force of eternal Providence on our Side.
Nor ought we to be di&s;couraged by tho&s;e un|favourable
Circum&s;tances, which at pre&s;ent
&s;eem to make again&s;t us. Tho' the Ignorance,
Super&s;tition and Corruption that now fill &s;o
much of the World, have a dark and my&s;terious
A&s;pect, it is not beyond the Power of that &s;u|preme
Being, who brings Light out of Dark|ne&s;s,
to unravel all tho&s;e perplexed Appearan|ces,
and gradually to extricate Mankind from
the Labyrinth of Vice and Error. From the
<PB N="4" REF="5">
<HI>pre&s;ent</HI> State of the World, it is not more un|likely,
that the Go&s;pel &s;hall one Day be univer|&s;ally
received, and exert its <HI>entire</HI> Influence on
the Hearts of Men; than <HI>once</HI> it was, that it
&s;hould reach <HI>&s;o far,</HI> and demoli&s;h <HI>&s;o much</HI> e|&s;tabli&s;hed
Super&s;tition as it has <HI>already</HI> done.
At the Ri&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, there was as great
a Di&s;proportion betwixt the apparent human
Cau&s;es, and the Effect which has been <HI>actually</HI>
produced, as there is, in our Times, betwixt
the Circum&s;tances of Religion in the World,
and the Effect which we <HI>farther</HI> expect. The
<HI>Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> having exerted its Influence
&s;o far, in breaking thro' the thicke&s;t Darkne&s;s,
we may ju&s;tly hope, that it is powerful enough
to di&s;pel all remaining Ob&s;curity, and that it
will a&s;cend by Degrees to that <HI>perfect Day,</HI>
when <HI>Healing &s;hall be under its Wings</HI> to all the
Nations. <HI>A little One &s;hall become a Thou&s;and,
and a &s;mall One a &s;trong Nation: I the Lord will
ha&s;ten it in its Time</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. lx. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BESIDES this <HI>Encouragement</HI> to our Endea|vours
for advancing Religion, there is to be
ob&s;erved in the Text, a preci&s;e <HI>Connection</HI> mark|ed
<PB N="5" REF="6">
betwixt the Increa&s;e of religious Knowledge
and the Happine&s;s of Mankind. <HI>The Know|ledge
of the Lord filling the Earth,</HI> is di&s;tinctly
a&s;&s;igned as the <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> why <HI>they &s;hall not hurt nor
de&s;troy in all God's holy Mountain.</HI> To this I
am principally to lead your Thoughts; as a Sub|ject
properly &s;uited to the Occa&s;ion of our Meet|ing,
and peculiarly <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> as I conceive, to
be inculcated, in the pre&s;ent Times, which &s;eem
to be waxing indifferent, more and more, to all
religious Principles. Whether Chri&s;tianity &s;hall
be propagated further or not, is treated as a
Matter of no great Concern to Mankind. O|pinions
prevail, that moral Virtue may &s;ub&s;i&s;t,
with equal Advantage, independent of Religi|on.
For <HI>moral Principles</HI> great Regard is pre|tended:
But <HI>Articles of religious Belief</HI> are
thought ab&s;tract Things; remote from Life;
Points of mere Speculation and Debate; of very
incon&s;iderable Influence on the Actions of
Men. The general Conduct of Mankind, it
is argued, will always proceed upon Principles
and Views of another Nature; and therefore,
religious Knowledge &s;tands in no nece&s;&s;ary
Connection with their Improvement or Hap|pine&s;s.
Fact and Experience is alledged for
<PB N="6" REF="7">
this. Even among&s;t many, who would not be
ranged on the Side of Unbelief, this loo&s;e and
indifferent Spirit too much prevails; and hence,
the Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion among&s;t us is too
vi&s;ibly &s;inking into Di&s;repute. How adver&s;e
all this is to the De&s;ign which the pre&s;ent Di&s;|cour&s;e
is intended to recommend, needs not be
&s;aid. How adver&s;e it is to the general Welfare
and mo&s;t real Intere&s;ts of Mankind, I hope,
&s;hall be made evident to candid Minds.</P>
<P>BY the <HI>Knowledge of the Lord,</HI> is not to be
under&s;tood the natural Knowledge of God only.
It is plain, the Prophet &s;peaks of tho&s;e Times
of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> when more enlarged Di&s;coveries
&s;hould be made to Mankind of the Divine Per|fections,
and of the Mea&s;ures of the Divine Ad|mini&s;tration,
than mere una&s;&s;i&s;ted Rea&s;on could
reach. Our natural Notices of God and Re|ligion
are not laid a&s;ide by Chri&s;tianity, but
cleared from Error, confirmed by higher Evi|dence,
and carried into a wider Field. In this
<HI>enlarged</HI> Sen&s;e of religious Knowledge, to make
its Importance to the Happine&s;s of Mankind
appear, let us con&s;ider Man,<LIST>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<ITEM>I. As an <HI>Individual,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>AND II. As a <HI>Member of Society.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. CONSIDERING Man, in his &s;ingle Capa|city,
as an <HI>Individual,</HI> our Inquiry &s;hall here
begin, of what <HI>Importance</HI> it is to him to have
ju&s;t and true Principles of religious Belief. This
divides it&s;elf unto two grand Branches: With
re&s;pect, fir&s;t, to his <HI>Improvement;</HI> and next, to
his <HI>Con&s;olation.</HI></P>
<P>1. As to the real <HI>Improvement</HI> of Man; the
Advancement of his Nature in what is morally
valuable and u&s;eful; the Acqui&s;ition of &s;uch
Di&s;po&s;itions and Habits, as fit him for acting
his Part well on this Stage, and prepare him
for a higher State of Life and Action hereaf|ter:
What Benefit does he receive, in the&s;e
Re&s;pects, from religious Knowledge and Belief?
It mu&s;t be obvious, that all Increa&s;e of Know|ledge
is Improvement to the <HI>Under&s;tanding.</HI>
The further its Sphere extends, the more Ob|jects
that are &s;ubmitted to its View and Con|templation,
e&s;pecially when tho&s;e Objects are
of intrin&s;ick <HI>Excellence,</HI> the more that under|&s;tanding
Power, which is the Glory of Man,
<PB N="8" REF="9">
is in the Cour&s;e of attaining its proper Strength
and Maturity. Hence <HI>Truth</HI> is ju&s;tly &s;aid to be
<HI>the Food of the Soul.</HI> But were the Knowledge
of Religion merely &s;peculative, tho' the Specu|lation
mu&s;t be allowed to be noble, yet le&s;s
could be &s;aid of its Importance. We recom|mend
it to Mankind, as forming their <HI>Hearts.</HI>
Pure and exalted Conceptions of the Deity,
&s;uch as Religion gives us;&mdash;The univer&s;al Fa|ther
and righteous Governor of the Univer&s;e;&mdash;the
Author of <HI>every good and perfect Gift;</HI> him|&s;elf
the Standard of un&s;potted Perfection and
Goodne&s;s;&mdash;conducting his whole Admini&s;tra|tion
with an eternal Regard to Order, Virtue
and Truth;&mdash;ever favouring the Cau&s;e, and
&s;upporting the Intere&s;ts of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and
righteous Men;&mdash;and applying to this the whole
Force of Omnipotence, and the whole Art of
unerring Wi&s;dom, from the Beginning to the
End of Things:&mdash;Such Conceptions of the Dei|ty
naturally de&s;cend into the Heart; kindle in
it the <HI>Love</HI> of Goodne&s;s, and e&s;tabli&s;h a Per&s;ua|&s;ion
of its being our highe&s;t <HI>Intere&s;t.</HI> They
give a peculiar <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Fortitude</HI> to the
Mind in the Practice of Virtue; and they pro|mote
a chearful <HI>Acquie&s;cence</HI> in this &s;upremely
<PB N="9" REF="10">
wi&s;e and righteous Admini&s;tration, <HI>whatever</HI>
Trials and Sufferings may ari&s;e.</P>
<P>ALL the Doctrines <HI>peculiar</HI> to Chri&s;tian Re|velation
are great Improvements of what the
Light of Nature imperfectly &s;ugge&s;ts. A Di&s;|pen&s;ation
of Providence is made known to us,
particularly &s;uited to the Exigencies of Man:
Calculated for recovering him from that cor|rupt
and guilty State, into which, <HI>Experience</HI>
bears Witne&s;s that he is fallen, and re&s;toring
him to a State of Integrity and Favour with his
Creator. The Method of carrying on this
great Plan is &s;uch as gives us the mo&s;t affecting
Views of the <HI>Importance</HI> of Holine&s;s and Good|ne&s;s,
and of the <HI>high Account</HI> in which it &s;tands
with God. The Son of God appearing on the
Earth, and dying as a <HI>Propitiation for the Sins
of the World,</HI> that he might <HI>bring in everla&s;ting
Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dan. ix. 24.</NOTE>; that he might <HI>purge our Con|&s;cience&s;
from dead Works, to &s;erve the living
God</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 14.</NOTE>; <HI>that he might redeem us from all Ini|quity,
and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar People,
zealous of good Works</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 14.</NOTE>. Such a gracious and
merciful Interpo&s;ition of the Creator of the
<PB N="10" REF="11">
World, &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hing a Proof of his Con|cern
for the moral Intere&s;ts of Mankind, is
mo&s;t proper to warm the Heart with <HI>Devoti|on;</HI>
and <HI>adds</HI> to the Cau&s;e of Goodne&s;s the
Force of every Motive from <HI>Gratitude</HI> and in|genuous
Affection. The&s;e Di&s;coveries of the
Go&s;pel have this further Effect, to e&s;tabli&s;h an
un&s;haken Confidence in God. They afford
&s;omething to the Mind, on which it can lay
hold as the <HI>Security</HI> of its Hope; when, with
a Certainty far beyond that of mere <HI>ab&s;tract
Argument,</HI> it appeals to <HI>Matter of Fact;</HI> and
is taught to &s;ay, <HI>He that &s;pared not his own Son,
but delivered him up for us all, how &s;hall he not
with him al&s;o freely give us all Things</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 32.</NOTE>? Hence
the great Encouragement to the <HI>Repentance</HI> and
Reformation of Sinners, from the Hope of
Acceptance with God thro' JESUS CHRIST,
and from the Belief of a Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance
communicated to the Upright in Heart. Whil&s;t
the Government of God is thus rendered mo&s;t
<HI>amiable,</HI> placed in a Light mo&s;t encouraging to
every virtuous Mind; there is, at the &s;ame
Time, &s;omething extremely <HI>awful</HI> and <HI>&s;olemn</HI>
in the whole Doctrine of the <HI>Redemption.</HI> It
<PB N="11" REF="12">
naturally &s;trikes the Mind with Reverence for
the Divine Law; pointing at &s;ome <HI>deep</HI> Malig|nity
in Sin, &s;ome dreadful Con&s;equences flow|ing
from it, <HI>unknown</HI> perhaps in their Cau&s;es,
and in their <HI>whole</HI> Extent, to the human Mind,
which moved the Creator of the World to de|part
from the ordinary Laws of Providence,
and to undertake the Re&s;toration of guilty Crea|tures,
by a Method &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing. Hence,
Mankind are <HI>awakened</HI> to &s;erious Reflection.
Hence, &s;uch Views ari&s;e of the Laws under
which they are placed, and of the Ends of Be|ing
they are bound to fulfil, as give <HI>Solemnity</HI>
to Virtue, and re&s;train them from trifling with
Life: E&s;pecially, when to this is joined the Di&s;|covery
of <HI>Life and Immortality</HI> by the Go&s;pel;
the Connection in which this Life &s;tands with
a future eternal State, for which we are now
under Probation; in a Cour&s;e of Di&s;cipline;
which, according as by Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance it
terminates in our Improvement in Virtue, or,
thro' our own Mi&s;conduct, leaves us in a cor|rupt
unimproved State, will di&s;mi&s;s us to la&s;ting
Abodes either of Puni&s;hment or Reward. This
is far above tho&s;e faint interrupted Hopes, tho&s;e
feeble ineffectual Rea&s;onings, which mere na|tural
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Light &s;ugge&s;ts, concerning the future Con|dition
of Mankind. Here we find, what alone
can be of any con&s;iderable Weight with Men
in Practice,&mdash;direct Promi&s;e and Threatning,&mdash;an
authoritative Sanction given to a Law,&mdash;the
Governor revealed,&mdash;and the Motives addre&s;&s;ed
to Hope and Fear, urged home on the Mind
by, <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> Nor are Cir|cum&s;tances
wanting to impre&s;s the <HI>Imagination</HI>
in the livelie&s;t Manner. The Re&s;urrection of
the Body, the Solemnity of a future Judgment,
the deci&s;ive Sentence, the final Separation, and
the everla&s;ting Man&s;ions of the Good and the
Bad, are all &s;et forth in &s;trong and affecting Co|lours.
In &s;hort, a great and magnificent <HI>Plan</HI>
of Divine Admini&s;tration is in Part opened;
and nothing is omitted that may give Mankind
the deepe&s;t Sen&s;e of their being all the Subjects
of the <HI>moral Government</HI> of God.</P>
<P>THE Bounds of this Di&s;cour&s;e have allowed
me to give but an imperfect View of the great
Principles of Religion. From the&s;e Hints, how|ever,
we may recollect &s;o much of the Chri&s;ti|an
Doctrine, as will be a &s;ufficient Foundation
for an Appeal to every impartial Mind, whether
<PB N="13" REF="14">
the <HI>Knowledge,</HI> the real and firm <HI>Belief</HI> of the&s;e
Principles of Religion, be not &s;trictly connected
with the <HI>Improvement</HI> of Man; and thereby of
the highe&s;t Importance to his <HI>Happine&s;s.</HI> I rea|&s;on
now with tho&s;e who admit, that to be vir|tuous
and good is real Improvement and Hap|pine&s;s.
Let them lay what Stre&s;s they will
upon Con&s;cience, upon its natural Authority
within, and the Force and Evidence of its Dic|tates:
Ob&s;tinate &s;ure they mu&s;t be, who will
not grant, that the natural Tendency of the&s;e
religious Principles is to <HI>&s;upport</HI> the Dictates,
and <HI>confirm</HI> the Authority of Con&s;cience; to
<HI>awaken,</HI> on various Occa&s;ions, the mo&s;t u&s;eful
Feelings; to provide <HI>additional</HI> Re&s;traints from
Vice, and <HI>additional</HI> Motives to every Virtue.
Who dares &s;ay, that there is no Ca&s;e in which
Con&s;cience &s;tands in real <HI>Need</HI> of &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
to <HI>direct,</HI> where there is &s;o much Uncer|tainty
and Darkne&s;s; and to <HI>prompt,</HI> where
there is &s;o much Feeblene&s;s and Irre&s;olution,
and &s;uch a fatal Pronene&s;s to Vice and Folly?</P>
<P>BUT how good &s;oever the <HI>Tendency</HI> of reli|gious
Principles may be, their <HI>actual</HI> Significan|cy
and Influence on Life will &s;till be called in
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Que&s;tion. This <HI>Tendency</HI> is by various Cau&s;es
defeated: Betwixt the <HI>Belief</HI> of religious Prin|ciples,
and corre&s;pondent <HI>Practice,</HI> it will be
&s;aid, that Experience &s;hows there is no nece&s;|&s;ary
Connection; nor can the Propagation of
the <HI>one</HI> at all a&s;&s;ure us, that proportionable Im|provements
will follow in the <HI>other.</HI>&mdash;This is
in Part allowed: As we allow, that Knowledge
and Belief admit of various Degrees, before they
arrive at that Chri&s;tian Faith, which the Scrip|ture
repre&s;ents as certainly <HI>purifying the Heart.</HI>
But, tho' the Connection be not <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> be|twixt
Knowledge and Practice, I hope it will
not be denied, that <HI>&s;ome</HI> Connection there is.
Here there is <HI>one</HI> Avenue to the Heart. If
the <HI>Tendency</HI> of religious Knowledge be good,
Wi&s;dom mu&s;t direct, and Duty oblige us to cul|tivate
it. For <HI>Tendency</HI> will, at lea&s;t in <HI>&s;ome</HI>
Ca&s;es, become <HI>effectual;</HI> in <HI>more</HI> Ca&s;es, proba|bly,
than are taken notice of amid&s;t the Hurry
of the World. Be&s;ides the <HI>known</HI> and <HI>di&s;tin|gui&s;hed</HI>
Examples of true Religion and Virtue,
which, in every Age of Chri&s;tianity, have &s;hone,
more or le&s;s, as <HI>Lights of the World:</HI> How ma|ny
may there be, in the more <HI>&s;ilent</HI> Scenes of
Life, overlooked by &s;uperficial Ob&s;ervers of
<PB N="15" REF="16">
Mankind, on who&s;e Hearts and Lives religious
Principles have a great and happy Influence?
Even on loo&s;e and giddy Minds, where they
are far from operating their full Effect, their
Influence is not altogether lo&s;t. Religious Prin|ciples
are at lea&s;t a <HI>Clog</HI> on Vice in its Career;
they &s;top it from going its <HI>full</HI> Length; and,
tho' they do not entirely reform the Mind, are
however the Means of pre&s;erving external Or|der,
and giving a Check to open Profligatene&s;s
and Di&s;&s;olution of Manners. Men, that are
now <HI>bad,</HI> might probably have been <HI>wor&s;e</HI>
without them; and the World have &s;uffered
more from their Licentiou&s;ne&s;s. Be&s;ides, they
often &s;ow latent Seeds of Goodne&s;s in the
Heart, which proper Circum&s;tances and Occa|&s;ions
ripen; when the Reformation of the Of|fender,
perhaps, is not &s;o con&s;picuous to the
World, as his former bad Manners have been.
From the <HI>native</HI> Tendency of religious Know|ledge
there is Rea&s;on to believe, that tho&s;e
good Effects of it are not <HI>&s;o rare,</HI> as &s;ome would
per&s;uade us; e&s;pecially, when we con&s;ider it
as accompanied with a <HI>Divine Ble&s;&s;ing.</HI> By the
Nature and plain Tendency of a Thing, it is
more rea&s;onable to judge of it, than to lay the
<PB N="16" REF="17">
<HI>whole</HI> Stre&s;s on Ob&s;ervations drawn from a <HI>&s;up|po&s;ed</HI>
Experience, which often is narrow in its
Compa&s;s, and fallacious in its Conclu&s;ions.
One great Cau&s;e of the Tendency of Religion
being often defeated, certainly is, that the
Knowledge of Divine Things is not thoroughly
imbibed, nor the Belief of them fully received.
Were a ju&s;t Sen&s;e and a firm Per&s;ua&s;ion of them
more general among&s;t Men, we may rationally
hope their good Effects would more exten&s;ively
appear.</P>
<P>I ADMIT indeed, that mere Knowledge will
prove unavailing again&s;t the Power of <HI>Temper</HI>
and &s;ettled <HI>Habits:</HI> The&s;e, 'tis &s;aid, govern the
Life of Men far more than religious Belief, and
will be too hard for all Principles whatever.
Perhaps this is &s;aid with Truth. But then we
ought to con&s;ider, that it is the Nature of Re|ligion
to work it&s;elf gradually into the Affecti|ons,
to acquire the <HI>Dominion</HI> of the Temper,
and &s;o to give Ri&s;e to Habits of acting. Hence
the Perfection of religious Influence is, with
great Ju&s;tice and Propriety, de&s;cribed in Scrip|ture,
by a <HI>new Heart and a new Spirit;</HI> when
the Mind is not involuntarily con&s;trained by
<PB N="17" REF="18">
Principle, but Principle forms the inward Con|&s;titution,
and becomes, in a Manner, the <HI>&s;ame</HI>
with Temper and Affection.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>actual</HI> Influence of Principle and
Belief on Mankind admits of further Illu&s;tra|tion,
from <HI>unconte&s;ted</HI> Matter of Fact. They
who hold the good Influence of Chri&s;tian Prin|ciples
to be <HI>&s;o incon&s;iderable,</HI> as to render the
Propagation of them of no great Importance,
will be at no Lo&s;s to give us In&s;tances of cor|rupt
and wrong Principles having had a <HI>great</HI>
Influence on the World. Loud Complaints
we hear from this Quarter, of the direful <HI>Ef|fects</HI>
which <HI>Super&s;tition</HI> and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> have
produced; how they have <HI>poi&s;oned</HI> the Tempers,
and <HI>tran&s;formed</HI> the Manners of Men; and
have <HI>overcome</HI> the &s;tronge&s;t Re&s;traints of Law,
of Rea&s;on and Humanity.&mdash;Is this then the
Ca&s;e, that <HI>all</HI> Principles, <HI>except good ones,</HI> are
&s;uppo&s;ed to be of &s;uch mighty <HI>Energy?</HI> Strange!
that fal&s;e Religion &s;hould do <HI>&s;o much,</HI> and true
Religion <HI>&s;o little.</HI>&mdash;No impartial Inquirer,
&s;ure, can be of &s;uch an ab&s;urd Opinion. The
whole Hi&s;tory of Mankind &s;hows, that religi|ous
Belief is no incon&s;iderable Principle of
<PB N="18" REF="19">
Action. The Mi&s;chief &s;uch Belief has done,
when mi&s;led, is indeed a good Argument to be
on our Guard again&s;t Error: But, as it is a
Proof of what Belief <HI>can</HI> do, it is an Argument
to hope the more from it, when rightly direct|ed.
The <HI>&s;ame</HI> Torrent that overflows and lays
wa&s;te a Country, when put out of its natural
Cour&s;e, enriches the Soil, when it runs in its
proper Bed. If it be alledged, that <HI>Super&s;tition</HI>
is the more powerful Principle, by falling in
with the weak and corrupt Propen&s;ities of
Mankind; it may be oppo&s;ed to this, that
<HI>Truth</HI> has the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing, and the Coun|tenance
of Heaven, on its Side. Let us always
hope well of a Cau&s;e that is good in it&s;elf, and
beneficial to Mankind. Truth is mighty, and
will prevail. Let us &s;pread the <HI>incorruptible
Seed</HI> as widely as we can, and tru&s;t in God, that
<HI>he will give the Increa&s;e.</HI> So much for the Im|portance
of religious Knowledge to every In|dividual,
in the Way of <HI>Improvement.</HI> Let us
next con&s;ider,</P>
<P>2. WHAT it promi&s;es in the Way of <HI>Con|&s;olation,</HI>
of Aid and Relief to Man, amid&s;t the
Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Life. Here it mu&s;t be allowed by
<PB N="19" REF="20">
all, that Religion triumphs; and its valuable
Influence in this Re&s;pect, mu&s;t be a &s;trong
Argument to every benevolent Mind, for wi&s;h|ing
that Influence to be further &s;pread thro'
the World. For, without religious Principle
and Hope, Man is a Creature <HI>mi&s;erable</HI> and
<HI>forlorn.</HI> He finds him&s;elf here a <HI>Stranger</HI> in a
wide World, where the Powers and Operations
of Nature are very imperfectly known; where
both the Cau&s;es and the I&s;&s;ues of Things are
wrapt up in much Darkne&s;s; where he is quite
at a Lo&s;s, or at be&s;t can form only an uncer|tain
Gue&s;s, whence he comes; for what Pur|po&s;e
he was brought unto this State of Being;
and whither he is to go, when he departs from
hence. What a <HI>di&s;con&s;olate</HI> Situation is this to
a &s;erious inquiring Mind! Even tho' it were in
a Man's Power to fill up the Hours of Life
with perpetual Amu&s;ement, void of Care; Life,
enjoyed on &s;uch Terms, would, upon Reflec|tion,
appear <HI>poor</HI> and <HI>trifling:</HI> But how much
<HI>wor&s;e,</HI> when we con&s;ider the real Condition of
Man; a Being frail and feeble, be&s;et with vari|ous
Dangers and Ills, and expo&s;ed to many a
melancholy Reflection, when he &s;ees all Things
around him &s;o tran&s;itory and decaying, and
<PB N="20" REF="21">
meets with <HI>Di&s;appointment</HI> and <HI>Sorrow,</HI> with
<HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Vexation,</HI> in all the Paths of Life!
In this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Condition, to reveal to him
&s;uch Di&s;coveries of God, and his Admini&s;tra|tion,
as the Chri&s;tian Religion affords, is to re|veal
to him a <HI>Father</HI> and a <HI>Friend;</HI> is to let in
a Ray of mo&s;t comforting Light upon the
Darkne&s;s of human E&s;tate. He who was be|fore
a de&s;titute Orphan, wandering in the in|ho&s;pitable
De&s;art, has now gained a Shelter
from the bitter and inclement Bla&s;t. He now
knows to <HI>whom</HI> to pray, and in <HI>whom</HI> to tru&s;t;
<HI>where</HI> to unbo&s;om his Sorrows; from <HI>what</HI>
Hand to look for Relief. Certain it is, that
when the Heart bleeds, from &s;ome Wound of
recent Mi&s;fortune, there is nothing of equal
Efficacy with religious Comfort. It is of Power
to chear the darke&s;t Hours, and to a&s;&s;wage the
deepe&s;t Woe, by the Belief of Divine Favour,
and the Pro&s;pect of happy Immortality. Here
the Mind expatiates with Joy; and, when be|reaved
of all its earthly Friends, &s;olaces it&s;elf
with the Thoughts of <HI>One</HI> Friend that will never
for&s;ake it. The&s;e Views have a greater and
better Effect on the Heart of a plain, but &s;in|cere
<HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> than all the Refinements of Phi|lo&s;ophy
<PB N="21" REF="22">
have on the <HI>Learned.</HI> Refined Rea&s;on|ings
may plea&s;e and amu&s;e the Mind when it is
at Ea&s;e; may, perhaps, help to relieve it, when
&s;lightly touched with Sorrow; but when it is
torn with any &s;ore Di&s;tre&s;s, they are <HI>cold</HI> and
<HI>feeble,</HI> compared with a direct <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> from the
Word of God. This is <HI>an Anchor to the Soul
both &s;ure and &s;tedfa&s;t.</HI> This has given <HI>Refuge and
&s;trong Con&s;olation</HI> to many a pious and virtuous
Soul, at a Time when mere <HI>Rea&s;onings</HI> would
have proved utterly unavailing. Be&s;ides, that
they can never be &s;o accommodated to the Bulk
of Mankind, as to be <HI>generally</HI> u&s;eful; this great
Di&s;advantage attends them, that they rai&s;e more
<HI>Perplexities</HI> in an <HI>inquiring</HI> Mind than it is in
their Power to re&s;olve. Upon the Approach
of <HI>Death,</HI> e&s;pecially, this will be felt; when, if
a Man thinks at all, his Anxiety mu&s;t naturally
increa&s;e about the future Concerns of his Soul.
<HI>Then</HI> it is, that the great Importance of the
Di&s;coveries of the Go&s;pel will appear: Not
only <HI>Life and Immortality</HI> brought to Light,
but the Path opened that leads to Life: A <HI>Me|diator</HI>
di&s;covered: <HI>Mercy</HI> proclaimed by the Go|vernor
of the World, thro' this Mediator, to
the Frailties and Errors of tho&s;e who are peni|tent,
<PB N="22" REF="23">
humble and &s;incere in Heart; and the
<HI>Pre&s;ence</HI> of their Redeemer promi&s;ed to con|duct
them thro' the Valley of the Shadow
of Death, to un&s;een Habitations of Re&s;t and
Glory, where he hath prepared their Place.
Here is Ground for good Men's leaving the
World with <HI>Comfort</HI> and <HI>Peace.</HI> But in this
<HI>&s;evere</HI> and <HI>trying</HI> Period, this <HI>labouring</HI> Hour
of Nature, how &s;hall the wretched Man &s;up|port
him&s;elf, who believes not, or knows not
the Hope of Religion?&mdash;Secretly con&s;cious to
him&s;elf, that he has not acted the Part he ought,
the Failings and Vices of his pa&s;t Life ari&s;e be|fore
him in &s;ad Remembrance. He <HI>wi&s;hes</HI> to
exi&s;t after Death; and yet is <HI>afraid</HI> of that Ex|i&s;tence.
The Governor of the World is <HI>un|known.</HI>
His Mercy, for any thing that he can
tell, may be implored <HI>in vain;</HI> all is my&s;terious
Ob&s;curity: And in the mid&s;t of endle&s;s Per|plexities
and Doubts, the trembling Soul is for|ced
away from the Body.&mdash;As the Mi&s;fortunes
of Life mu&s;t have been in&s;upportable to &s;uch
a Man, &s;o its End is bitter. His &s;etting Sun
goes down in a dark Cloud; and the Night
of Death clo&s;es over his Head, full of Mi&s;ery.
<HI>Having no Hope,</HI> and <HI>being without God,</HI> that
<PB N="23" REF="24">
is, without the Knowledge of God <HI>in the World,</HI>
are two Things mo&s;t ju&s;tly connected by the
Apo&s;tle, when he is de&s;cribing the Mi&s;ery of
the Heathen Nations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 12.</NOTE>. Thus, by Means of
<HI>the Knowledge of the Lord,</HI> Man, con&s;idered as
an <HI>Individual,</HI> is both <HI>improved</HI> and <HI>comforted.</HI>
We are next to &s;how,</P>
<P N="2">II. WHAT Benefit he receives from this
Knowledge, as a <HI>Member of Society.</HI> This
Branch of the Subject is in Part anticipated, by
what has been already &s;aid. For all the <HI>Im|provement</HI>
that Man, as an <HI>Individual,</HI> receives
from religious Knowledge, redounds to the Be|nefit
of the <HI>Publick.</HI> Society reaps the Fruits
of the Virtue of all its Members; and as <HI>each,</HI>
apart, is made better, the <HI>whole</HI> mu&s;t propor|tionably
flouri&s;h. But, be&s;ides this, religious
Knowledge has a <HI>direct</HI> Tendency to improve
the &s;ocial Intercour&s;es of Men, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t
them in co-operating for common Good.</P>
<P>FOR, fir&s;t of all, it <HI>forms</HI> them for Society.
It <HI>civilizes</HI> Mankind. It tames the Fiercene&s;s
of their Pa&s;&s;ions, and wears off the Barbarity of
their Manners. Without &s;ome Notions of Re|ligion,
<PB N="24" REF="25">
it is much to be que&s;tioned, whether any
regular Society ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, or could &s;ub&s;i&s;t,
in the World. All tho&s;e who, in early Times,
attempted to reduce wandering and &s;cattered
Men unto Society, found it nece&s;&s;ary to begin
with &s;ome In&s;titution of Religion: And the
wi&s;e&s;t Legi&s;lators of old, thro' the whole Pro|gre&s;s
of their Sy&s;tems of Government, treated
it as nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential to Civil Polity. If
even tho&s;e <HI>imperfect</HI> Forms of Religion, mixed
with &s;o much Error, were important to Socie|ty;
<HI>how much more,</HI> that rea&s;onable and true
Wor&s;hip of God which the Go&s;pel teaches?
True Religion introduces the Idea of regular
Subjection, by accu&s;toming Mankind to the
<HI>Awe</HI> of &s;uperior Power, in the Deity, <HI>joined</HI>
with the <HI>E&s;teem</HI> of &s;uperior Wi&s;dom and Good|ne&s;s.
It is, by its Natnre, an <HI>a&s;&s;ociating</HI> Prin|ciple,
creating new and &s;acred Bonds of Union
among&s;t Men. Common A&s;&s;emblies for reli|gious
Wor&s;hip, and the joint Veneration of
one God; the Sen&s;e of being all, in common,
dependent on the &s;ame &s;upreme Protection,
and bound by the &s;ame Ties to Duty, Sharers
of the &s;ame Benefits of Religion, and Expec|tants
of the &s;ame Reward; all this has a Ten|dency
<PB N="25" REF="26">
to awaken the Sen&s;e of our friendly Re|lation,
to knit us together, and &s;trengthen our
mutual Connection.</P>
<P>FURTHER, religious Knowledge a&s;&s;i&s;ts in
preparing the Way for all u&s;eful and ornamen|tal
Improvements in Society. It has, in Fact,
been found, that, along with the Increa&s;e of
<HI>religious</HI> Light, <HI>Learning</HI> has flouri&s;hed, and
u&s;eful <HI>Arts</HI> have been cultivated and advanced.
The true Knowledge of the Lord promotes a
<HI>free</HI> and <HI>manly</HI> Spirit. It teaches Men to think
for them&s;elves, to form their Principles upon a
a fair Inquiry unto the Word of God; and not
to re&s;ign their Con&s;ciences implicitely to Men.
Hence, it is &s;trongly connected with a Dete&s;ta|tion
of Oppre&s;&s;ion of every kind; and forms a
Ta&s;te for <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Laws.</HI> We &s;ee that ty|rannical
Governments have taken the firme&s;t
Root, in Nations blinded by <HI>Mahometan</HI> and
<HI>Pagan</HI> Darkne&s;s, where the Throne of Vio|lence
is <HI>&s;upported</HI> by Ignorance and Error. In
the Chri&s;tian World, as long as <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Super&s;ti|tion
reigned undi&s;turbed, <HI>Darkne&s;s, Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI>
and <HI>Slavery</HI> were in its Train. For &s;ome Cen|turies,
the Cloud &s;at <HI>thick</HI> and <HI>deep</HI> over all <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="27">
and threatned a Relap&s;e unto ancient Bar|barity:
Till, at the au&s;picious Aera of the <HI>Refor|mation,</HI>
together with the true <HI>Knowledge of
the Lord, Learning, Liberty</HI> and <HI>Arts,</HI> began
to &s;hine forth, and re&s;ume their Lu&s;tre. At
this Day, the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion</HI> is, in our own,
and &s;ome other States, the great Bulwark of
<HI>Liberty.</HI> The Promoters of arbitrary Power
know this well; and hence, it has been their
con&s;tant Aim to bear it down; and in place of
the <HI>Knowledge of the Lord,</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h an <HI>im|plicit</HI>
Submi&s;&s;ion to the Dictates of <HI>Men,</HI> in
Matters of Religion.</P>
<P>BUT this is not the whole of that happy In|fluence
which religious Knowledge hath on
Society. It is not only &s;ub&s;idiary to its <HI>Im|provement,</HI>
but nece&s;&s;ary to its <HI>Pre&s;ervation.</HI>
It is the very <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> on which it re&s;ts. For re|ligious
Principle is what gives Mankind the
&s;ure&s;t Hold of one another. That la&s;t and
greate&s;t Pledge of Veracity, an <HI>Oath,</HI> without
which no Society can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, derives its whole
Authority from the Reverence of God, to
whom it is a &s;olemn Appeal. Bani&s;h religious
Principle, and you loo&s;en all the Bonds of So|ciety:
<PB N="27" REF="28">
You &s;hake the fundamental Pillar of all
mutual Tru&s;t and Confidence among&s;t Men;
nay, you de&s;troy the Security ari&s;ing from
<HI>Laws</HI> them&s;elves. For human Laws and hu|man
Sanctions cannot extend to numberle&s;s
Ca&s;es, in which the Safety of Mankind is high|ly
concerned. They would be very ineffectual
Means of maintaining the Order and Peace of
Society, if there were no Checks upon Men,
from the Sen&s;e of Divine Legi&s;lation; if no Be|lief
of Divine Rewards and Puni&s;hments were
to come in Aid, of what human Rewards and
Puni&s;hments &s;o imperfectly provide for.</P>
<P>INDEED, the Belief of Religion is of &s;uch
Importance to publick Welfare, that the mo&s;t
expre&s;&s;ive De&s;cription we could give of a Soci|ety,
in the utmo&s;t Circum&s;tances of Di&s;order,
would be to &s;ay, There was no <HI>Fear of God</HI>
left among&s;t them.&mdash;Our Imagination would
immediately conceive of them as loo&s;e and law|le&s;s;
abandoned to Rapine and Violence, to
Perfidy and Treachery; deceiving and deceived;
oppre&s;&s;ing and oppre&s;t; con&s;umed by inte&s;tine
Broils, and ripe for becoming a Prey to the fir&s;t
Invader.&mdash;On the other hand, in order to any
<PB N="28" REF="29">
Society's flouri&s;hing in its highe&s;t <HI>Perfection</HI>
and <HI>Glory,</HI> we need only &s;uppo&s;e the Belief of
Chri&s;tian Principles prevailing in &s;uch a De|gree,
as to exert their <HI>entire</HI> Influence on the
Hearts and Lives of all its Members. <HI>Then</HI>
would the mo&s;t amiable Scene open. We would
&s;ee the <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> of publick Di&s;union in&s;tantly re|moved,
when Men were once formed to the
Pur&s;uit of tho&s;e higher Intere&s;ts, which give
no Occa&s;ion to <HI>Competitions</HI> and <HI>Jealou&s;ies;</HI> and
warmed in Heart with that noble Spirit of <HI>Love</HI>
which our holy Religion breathes; and of
which it hath &s;et before us &s;uch illu&s;trious Ex|amples
in Almighty God, and our ble&s;&s;ed Re|deemer.
We would &s;ee the Principles of Chri|&s;tian
Faith &s;hedding over Families, Neighbour|hoods
and Communities; the comfortable In|fluences
of Unity and Peace, like the <HI>Dew of
Hermon, and the Dew that de&s;cendeth upon the
Mountains of Zion, where the Lord commandeth
the Ble&s;&s;ing, even Life for evermore</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxxxiii. 3.</NOTE>. We
would &s;ee them in&s;piring private Faith and pub|lick
Loyalty; re&s;toring Sobriety of Manners
and Simplicity of Life; promoting in every
Man Contentment with his Lot, Re&s;ignation
<PB N="29" REF="30">
to Divine Appointment, continual Regard to
the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven.&mdash;We may extol <HI>Riches</HI>
and <HI>Traffick;</HI> but, in Truth, the Prevalency
of &s;uch Principles of publick <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Con|cord,</HI>
forms the real <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of a
Nation. In Proportion as the&s;e prevail, they
give us the Pro&s;pect of human Society ri&s;ing
from that &s;ad <HI>Degeneracy</HI> into which it is at
pre&s;ent &s;unk, and advancing, under the Ble&s;|&s;ing
of Heaven, towards that happy Period,
when <HI>Nation &s;hall not lift up their Sword again&s;t
Nation, nor War be learned any more</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. ii. 4.</NOTE>; <HI>when
there &s;hall be nothing to hurt nor de&s;troy in all
the holy Mountain of God.</HI></P>
<P>To convince us yet further of the Impor|tance
of religious Knowledge to the Welfare
of Society, there is one Con&s;ideration which
de&s;erves particular Attention. It is this; That
if <HI>good Seed</HI> be not &s;own in the Field, <HI>Tares</HI>
will infallibly ari&s;e. There is a &s;trong <HI>Propen|&s;ion</HI>
in human Nature to Religion: A natural
Preparation of the Mind for receiving &s;ome
Impre&s;&s;ions of religious Belief. In ignorant
and uncultivated Minds, <HI>Super&s;tition</HI> or <HI>Enthu|&s;ia&s;m</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="31">
never fail to graft them&s;elves upon this
Root. Into what mon&s;trous Forms <HI>the&s;e</HI> have
&s;hot forth, and what various Mi&s;chiefs they
have produced in Society, is too well known.
But this is not the <HI>whole</HI> of the Danger. For
de&s;igning Men are &s;eldom wanting to take <HI>Ad|vantage</HI>
of popular Weakne&s;s; and to <HI>improve</HI>
a &s;uper&s;titious Bia&s;s to their own ambitious and
intere&s;ted <HI>Ends.</HI> Hence Super&s;tition, in it&s;elf
a formidable Evil, threatens Con&s;equences &s;till
more formidable, when it is made the <HI>Tool</HI> of
Ambition and Intere&s;t. In this Way <HI>Popery</HI>
has become the Means of en&s;laving the People,
and exalting the Church to exorbitant Power;
and, like &s;ome baneful Planet, has &s;hed mo&s;t
malignant Influences both on the civil and re|ligious
Intere&s;ts of Chri&s;tian Society.</P>
<P>As it is the <HI>Ignorance</HI> of true Religion which
gives Ri&s;e to tho&s;e Evils, this furni&s;hes us with
one &s;trong Argument, for promoting the Know|ledge
of it in the World; that ju&s;t and rational
Principles of Religion may fill up the <HI>Room</HI> in
Mens Minds, which Super&s;tition will otherwi&s;e
u&s;urp; and the Enemies of Society will make
their Advantage of. This brings the Ca&s;e near|er
<PB N="31" REF="32">
to our&s;elves, by &s;ugge&s;ting to us the Condi|tion
of that Part of our own Country, upon
which the <HI>Society for propagating Chri&s;tian
Knowledge</HI> have chiefly be&s;towed their Care.
A Part of the Country, which may be con&s;i|dered
as yet <HI>rude</HI> and <HI>uncivilized;</HI> where Society
has &s;carcely got beyond its <HI>Infant</HI> State; and
whither the Influence of Government and Or|der
has very imperfectly reached: Where the
Inhabitants, hitherto accu&s;tomed to no Subjec|tion,
except a &s;lavi&s;h Dependence on their Chief|tains,
are inured to Rapine, totally negligent of
the Arts of Peace, and Strangers to cultivated
Life: Where the gro&s;&s;e&s;t <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Su|per&s;tition</HI>
have remarkably reigned, and have
nouri&s;hed, as their <HI>proper</HI> Off&s;pring, a blind At|tachment
to &s;ome pernicious Notions of Go|vernment,
artfully in&s;tilled into their Minds.
If ever the Aid of religious Knowledge was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to e&s;tabli&s;h and a&s;&s;i&s;t Society, it mu&s;t
be allowed to be nece&s;&s;ary here: E&s;pecially, as
we know Popi&s;h Emi&s;&s;aries have not been want|ing
among them, to &s;ow their <HI>poi&s;onous</HI> Prin|ciples;
and to foment that <HI>di&s;affected</HI> Spirit, the
violent Effects of which were felt a few Years
ago; when we &s;aw them ru&s;hing, like a Torrent
<PB N="32" REF="33">
from their own bleak Mountains, to &s;pread
Confu&s;ion and Terror through a peaceful
Land.&mdash;If &s;o many of our Countrymen have
hitherto been not only <HI>u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> but even <HI>danger|ous</HI>
to the re&s;t of the Society, ought not <HI>all</HI> wi&s;e
and good Men to encourage the De&s;ign of pro|pagating
among them tho&s;e Principles of true
religious Knowledge, which may <HI>reform</HI> them
from Barbarity, and <HI>unite</HI> them to the re&s;t of
the Society? Regard to our own Safety and
Tranquility might alone recommend this De|&s;ign,
tho' no <HI>higher</HI> Motive were applied to.
The Method, that is employed in carrying it
on, mu&s;t be allowed to be inconte&s;tably proper;
the E&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Schools</HI> for the religious
Education of Youth, who mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have
been void of all moral Culture, and of Cour&s;e
have been the prepared In&s;truments of Vio|lence
and Cruelty. The good De&s;igns of the
<HI>Legi&s;lature</HI> for introducing regular Govern|ment,
Indu&s;try and Arts, into tho&s;e Parts of the
Country, can never be pur&s;ued with Succe&s;s, if
Endeavours be not <HI>early</HI> u&s;ed, to root out bad
Principles, both of Religion and Government,
from their Minds, and to plant right ones in
their &s;tead. The more directly to co-operate
<PB N="33" REF="34">
with the Legi&s;lature for <HI>civil</HI> Good, the <HI>Society</HI>
have not confined them&s;elves to the Care of
<HI>religious</HI> Education; but make it their Endea|vour
to bani&s;h <HI>Idlene&s;s,</HI> and to in&s;truct Youth
in <HI>&s;uch Arts</HI> as may qualify them to be u&s;eful
Members of Civil Society<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Society are authori&s;ed, by a &s;econd Patent obtained from the Crown, in the Year 1738, to <HI>cau&s;e &s;uch of the Children as they &s;hall think fit, to be in&s;tructed and bred up to Hu&s;bandry, Trades and Manufactures, or to &s;uch other manual Operations as the Society &s;hall think proper.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE Con&s;iderations directly re&s;pect the
Good of Society. But, when we take the Ar|gument
that has been treated, in its <HI>full</HI> Extent;
when we con&s;ider the Importance of religious
Knowledge, to the <HI>Improvement</HI> and the <HI>Con&s;o|lation</HI>
of every <HI>Individual,</HI> to their <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Happi|ne&s;s,
and their Preparation for <HI>future</HI> Glory, the
Motive for &s;preading that Knowledge through
the World receives a great Addition of Strength.
Is it not an affecting Thought, that there &s;hould
be &s;o many of our Fellow-creatures, nay of

<HEAD>STATE
OF THE
SOCIETY in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
FOR
Propagating CHRISTIAN KNOW|LEDGE,
in the Year 1750.</HEAD>
<P>THIS SOCIETY took its Ri&s;e about the
Year 1700; and, in the Year 1709, was
erected into a Body corporate, by Letters pa|tent
from her late Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> The
Intention was to promote the Knowledge of
Chri&s;tianity thro' the remote Corners of the
Highlands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> mi&s;erably &s;unk in Dark|ne&s;s
and in Ignorance; a De&s;ign, which every
one mu&s;t acknowledge laudable, and worthy of
Encouragement.</P>
<P>THIS Encouragement it met from many
pious and well-di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons, who, from
<PB N="40" REF="40">
time to time, did, and do &s;till contribute to|wards
its Support, by charitable Donations, in
&s;o much, that at pre&s;ent the Society finds it&s;elf
in Condition to maintain no fewer than 136
Schools, at which are educated to the Number
of 7000 Children of both Sexes.</P>
<P>THE Directors u&s;e the Word <HI>educate,</HI> be|cau&s;e
that comes up be&s;t to the De&s;ign of the
Society, which is, to in&s;truct the Children, fir&s;t
of all, in the Knowledge of Chri&s;tianity, the
reformed Prote&s;tant Religion. 2<HI>dly,</HI> In Writ|ing,
Orthography, Arithmetick and Church
Mu&s;ick. 3<HI>dly,</HI> In the Knowledge of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Tongue, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to root out the
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> altogether. And, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> To teach them
right Principles of Government, to in&s;til a
Love of true Liberty and Affection to King
<HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>WITH this De&s;ign did the Society &s;et out,
with this De&s;ign does it &s;till go on, and in this
De&s;ign it has, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, happily &s;uc|ceeded;
&s;o that, from the Beginning of its E|rection,
until now, (at the mo&s;t moderate Com|putation)
it has been the Means of in&s;tructing
<PB N="41" REF="41">
50,000 Children, of both Sexes, in the Know|ledge
of Chri&s;tianity. The fir&s;t Step to intro|duce
Religion into the Heart, is to di&s;pel the
Clouds of Ignorance in the Head.&mdash;The So|ciety
can do no more than Men can do; they
may endeavour to convey Knowledge into the
Head, but it is the Office of the &s;upreme Be|ing
to bring it home to the Heart.</P>
<P>AND, &s;ure, the Means which this Society
u&s;es are of all others the mo&s;t proper. They
are applied to the Minds of the Inhabitants,
when the&s;e Minds and the&s;e inhabitants are
young, and their Tempers, like the Willow,
are more ea&s;ily bent any Way.&mdash;If they cannot
&s;ucceed at this Age, they never will at any;
and it is believed, that if this Method of re|forming
the Highlands of <HI>Scotland</HI> proves a|bortive,
all other human Methods certainly will.</P>
<P>SURE then, it cannot but be the Duty, and
mu&s;t be the Intere&s;t of every good Man, of e|very
<HI>Briton,</HI> to encourage this De&s;ign;&mdash;tend|ing
&s;o evidently to make us a happy,&mdash;a
free,&mdash;and an united Nation.&mdash;Religion and
Liberty, and Indu&s;try and Joy, are Si&s;ters, and
<PB N="42" REF="42">
never appear to &s;uch Advantage, as in Compa|ny
with one another.&mdash;While Super&s;tition and
Slavery, and Idlene&s;s and Sullene&s;s, are Spectres
the mo&s;t hideous, and ought to have their
Dwelling not upon the Earth, but under it.</P>
<P>THE Society obtained a new Patent in the
Year 1738, enabling them to in&s;truct the Chil|dren,
under their Care, in the Knowledge of
Hu&s;bandry and Hou&s;ewifery, Trade and Ma|nufacture,
or in &s;uch like manual Operations.
This they have already done in &s;everal remark|able
In&s;tances, and are de&s;ireous to do &s;o in
more, as their Stock enables them. And they
apply the Benefactions made, either to the
Purpo&s;es of the fir&s;t, or of the &s;econd Charter,
as the Donor is plea&s;ed to direct; &s;o that now,
Religion and Indu&s;try go Hand in Hand,
&s;trengthen and e&s;tabli&s;h one another.</P>
<P>AMONG the various In&s;tances of Genero&s;ity
which the Year 1749 has produced, the Direc|tors
judge them&s;elves bound to take particular
Notice of the two following, both from one
Country, that of <HI>Ireland.</HI> The one is the Li|berality
of an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Gentleman of Di&s;tinction,
who has not only paid into the Society 100 <HI>l.</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="43"> <HI>Sterl.</HI> towards the Support of Charity Schools
in the I&s;lands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but al&s;o cau&s;ed
tran&s;late Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>'s <HI>Call to the Unconverted,</HI>
&amp;c. into the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Language, (for the U&s;e of
&s;uch as cannot learn <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>) under Direction
of this Society, and has given a very con&s;ider|able
Sum, and engaged to pay what further
may be nece&s;&s;ary for defraying the Expence of
it.&mdash;The Work is now fini&s;hed, by the La|bours
of a Reverend Member of the Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and will be printed without De|lay,
and di&s;tributed at the Sight of the Society.</P>
<P>THE other is a Legacy, which the Society
has received from Mr. <HI>Hall,</HI> Surgeon in <HI>Dub|lin,</HI>
for no le&s;s than 100 <HI>l. Sterl.</HI>&mdash;of which
they have now actually got Payment.&mdash;Two
In&s;tances worthy to be imitated by all, (where
Circum&s;tances will allow) who hope for that
melting Acknowledgement of the Saviour of
Sinners: <HI>In as much as ye have done tho&s;e Things
to one of the lea&s;t of my Brethren, ye have done
them unto me.</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES tho&s;e Endeavours u&s;ed by the So|ciety
to promote the Knowledge of true Reli|gion
at home, they have al&s;o in Conformity
<PB N="44" REF="44">
to a Clau&s;e in their fir&s;t Patent, extended their
Care to Places abroad, particularly to the wild
and wandering <HI>Indians</HI> on the Borders of <HI>New
York, New Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Pen&s;ilvania.</HI> The fir&s;t
Attempt of this Kind was made in the Year
1731, and another and more &s;ucce&s;sful one in
the Year 1741 and 1747. Of the Succe&s;s of
this la&s;t Mi&s;&s;ion the World has had a printed
Account (under the Care of Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI>)
in Mr. <HI>Brainard</HI>'s Journal. To this the Di|rectors
beg Leave to refer, after adding the fol|lowing
Extract of the Society's late&s;t Advices
from Mr. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> Pre&s;es of the Society of
<HI>American</HI> Corre&s;pondents.<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>New York, <DATE>April 27th 1749.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INCLOSED you have the Journals of the
Society's two Mi&s;&s;ionaries, who diligent|ly
attend their re&s;pective Charges, and the
mo&s;t of tho&s;e, whom we charitably hoped
were the Subjects of a &s;aving Change, con|tinue
to adorn their Profe&s;&s;ion by a Behavi|our
and exemplary Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Brainard</HI>'s <HI>Indians</HI> are daily forming
them&s;elves more and more into a civilized
<PB N="45" REF="45">
and orderly Society.&mdash;The Men cultivate
their Lands, the Women are learning to &s;pin,
and they have, in a great Mea&s;ure, abandon|ed
that &s;lothful Cour&s;e of Life, which is &s;o
natural to all <HI>Indians,</HI> that they are brought
off from it with the utmo&s;t Difficulty.</P>
<P>We have &s;et up a Seminary of Learning
in <HI>New Jer&s;ey;</HI> and if the Society, by re|commending
our De&s;ign to pious and chari|table
Per&s;ons, could procure us any A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,
it would doubtle&s;s be of exten&s;ive Ser|vice
to the Intere&s;t of Religion in the&s;e
Parts. <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>By the two la&s;t Journals which the Society
have received from Mr. <HI>Brainard,</HI> it appears,
among other Things, that many of the <HI>Indi|ans</HI>
are grown extremely de&s;irous of reading and
under&s;tanding the Word of God;&mdash;For that
End, &s;ays he, they attend an Evening School,
which the Schoolma&s;ter has &s;et up on Purpo&s;e.&mdash;The greater Part of the young People attend
this School al&s;o, and &s;ome that are 40 or 50
Years of Age; and it is hoped, that mo&s;t of
them will, in a little Time, be able to read the
<PB N="46" REF="46">
Bible. The School is increa&s;ing, and the Chil|dren
make good Progre&s;s in their Learning.</P>
<P>As to the College propo&s;ed to be erected in
<HI>New Jersey,</HI> the Society have done every Thing
in their Power to encourage it, and have &s;et a|part
the Sum of 30 <HI>l. Sterl.</HI> to be employed in
buying proper Books for the Students; &s;o that,
in a little Time, there is rea&s;on to hope, that
there will be no more Rea&s;on for a Complaint,
&s;o often made in the&s;e Parts, That <HI>the Harve&s;t
is great, but the Labourers are few.</HI>&mdash;Neither
can the Directors omit taking this Opportunity
of recommending this good De&s;ign to others.
The Thing indeed recommends it&s;elf, and mu&s;t
do &s;o to every Per&s;on, who&s;e Heart is capable
of the lea&s;t Tincture of Compa&s;&s;ion for &s;uch
va&s;t Numbers of poor forlorn <HI>Indians.</HI>&mdash;Nor
would &s;uch a Seminary an&s;wer a religious End
only, it would al&s;o &s;erve a political View; for
&s;ure, if from us Learning and good Manners
could be propagated thro' the&s;e Savages, it
would be a Mean of engaging them more firm|ly
in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t. And if, along with
Learning and good Manners, true Religion
&s;hould take place among them, and they be|come
<PB N="47" REF="47">
come Subjects, willing Subjects of the KING
of all Kings, what Joy would not this yield to
every &s;incere Chri&s;tian?</P>
<P>BY this Means, Streams would break out
in that va&s;t Wilderne&s;s, and Rivers run in that
immen&s;e De&s;art.&mdash;Nay, the De&s;art would re|joice
and blo&s;&s;om as the Ro&s;e; &s;o that from the
Ri&s;ing of the Sun unto where he goeth down,
a pure Offering &s;hould be offered unto the true
God.&mdash;Men &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed in Je&s;us, and all
Nations call him Ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Prayers of this Society, and
they are the Prayers of every true Chri&s;tian.</P>
