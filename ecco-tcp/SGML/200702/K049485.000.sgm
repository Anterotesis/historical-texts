<HEAD>TO THE Right Honourable THE Earl of Jer&s;ey, Lord Chamberlain of his Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;hold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF any thing may attone for the Liberty I take in offering this trifle to your Lord&s;hip, it is, that I will Engage not to be guilty of the Common Vice of Dedications, nor pre|tend to give the World an account of the many good qualities they ought to admire in your Lord&s;hip. I hope I may reckon on it as &s;ome little piece of merit, in an age where there are &s;o many people write Panegyricks, and &s;o few de&s;erve 'em. I am &s;ure you ought not to &s;it for your Picture, to &s;o ill a hand as mine. Men of your Lord&s;hip's Figure and Station, tho U&s;eful and Ornamantal to the Age they live in, are yet re&s;erv'd for the Labours of the Hi&s;torian, and the Entertain|ment of Po&s;terity; nor ought to be a&s;pers'd with &s;uch pieces of Flattery while living, as may render the true Hi&s;tory &s;u&s;|pected
<PB REF="3">
to tho&s;e that come after. That which &s;hould take up all my Care at pre&s;ent, is mo&s;t humbly to beg your Lord&s;hips pardon for Importuning you upon this account; for imagin|ing that your Lord&s;hip, (who&s;e hours are all dedicated to the be&s;t and mo&s;t important u&s;es) can have any lei&s;ure for this piece of Poetry. I beg, my Lord, that you will receive it, as it was meant, a mark of my Entire Re&s;pect and Veneration.</P>
<P>I hope it may be &s;ome advantage to me, that the Town has not receiv'd this Play ill; to have depended meerly upon your Lord&s;hips good nature, and have offer'd &s;omething without any degree of merit, would have been an unpardonable fault, e&s;pe|cially to &s;o good a Judge. The Play it &s;elf, as I pre&s;ent it to your Lord&s;hip, is a much more perfect Poem than it is in the repre&s;entation on the Stage. I was led into an Error in the writing of it, by thinking that it would be ea&s;ier to retrench than to add: But when I was at la&s;t nece&s;&s;itated, by rea&s;on of the extreme length, to cut off near &s;ix hundred Lines, I found that it was maim'd by it to a great di&s;advantage. The Fable (which has no manner of relation to any part of true Hi&s;tory,) was left dark and intricate, for want of a great part of the narration, which was left out in the fir&s;t Scene; and the Chain and Connexion, which ought to be in the Dialogue, was inter|rupted in many other places. But &s;ince what was omitted in the Acting, is now kept in, I hope it may indifferently Enter|tain your Lord&s;hip at an unbending hour. The faults which are mo&s;t generally found, (and which I could be very proud of &s;ubmitting to your Lord&s;hip's Judgment, if you can have lei&s;ure for &s;o trivial a cau&s;e,) are, that the Cata&s;trophe in the fifth Act is barbarous, and &s;hocks the Audience. Some people, who&s;e Judgment I ought to have a deference for, have told me that they wi&s;ht I had given the latter part of the &s;tory quite another turn; that <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> and <HI>Ame&s;tris</HI> ought to have been pre&s;erv'd, and made happy in the Conclu&s;ion of the Play; that be&s;ides the &s;atisfaction which the Spectators would have had to have &s;een two Vertuous (or at lea&s;t Innocent) Characters, re|warded and &s;ucce&s;sful, there might have been al&s;o a more No|ble and In&s;tructive Moral drawn that way. I mu&s;t confe&s;s if this be an Error, (as I perhaps it may,) it is a voluntary one
<PB REF="4">
and an Error of my Judgment: Since in the writing I actually made &s;uch a &s;ort of an Objection to my &s;elf; and cho&s;e to wind up the &s;tory this way. Tragedies have been al|low'd, I know, to be written both ways very beautifully. But &s;ince Terror and Pity are laid down for the Ends of Tragedy, by the great Ma&s;ter and Father of Critici&s;m, I was always inclin'd to fancy, that the la&s;t and remaining Impre&s;&s;ions, which ought to be left on the minds of an Audience, &s;hould proceed from one of the&s;e two. They &s;hould be &s;truck with Terror in &s;everal parts of the Play, but always Conclude and go away with Pity, a &s;ort of regret proceeding from good nature, which, tho an unea&s;ine&s;s, is not always di&s;agreeable, to the per&s;on who feels it. It was this pa&s;&s;ion that the famous Mr <HI>Otway</HI> &s;ucceeded &s;o well in touching, and mu&s;t and will at all times affect people, who have any tenderne&s;s or humanity. If therefore I had &s;av'd <HI>Ar|taxerxes</HI> and <HI>Ame&s;tris,</HI> I believe (with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to my Judges) I had de&s;troy'd the greate&s;t occa&s;ion for Compa&s;&s;ion in the whole Play. Any body may perceive, that &s;he is rais'd to &s;ome degrees of happine&s;s, by hearing that her Father and Husband are living, (whom &s;he had &s;uppos'd dead,) and by &s;eeing the Enemy and Per&s;ecuter of her Family dying at her feet, purpo&s;e|ly, that the turn of her death may be more &s;urprizing and pitiful. As for that part of the Objection, which &s;ays, that Innocent per&s;ons ought not to be &s;hewn unfortunate; The &s;uc|ce&s;s and general approbation, which many of the be&s;t Trage|dies that have been writ, and which were built on that founda|tion, have met with, will be &s;ufficient an&s;wer for me.</P>
<P>That which they call the Poetical Ju&s;tice, is, I think, &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd, the two principal Contrivers of Evil, the State&s;man and Prie&s;t, are puni&s;h'd with death; and the Queen is depos'd from her authority by her own Son; which, I &s;uppo&s;e, will be allowed as the &s;evere&s;t mortification that could happen to a woman of her Imperious temper.</P>
<P>If there can be any excu&s;e for my Entertaining your Lord&s;hip with this <HI>Detail</HI> of Critici&s;ms, it is, That I would have this fir&s;t mark of the honour I have for your Lord&s;hip appear with as few faults as po&s;&s;ible. Did not the prevailing Character of your Lord&s;hip's Excellent humanity and good nature encourage
<PB REF="5">
me, what ought I not to fear from the nicene&s;s of your Ta&s;te and Judgment? The delicacy of your reflexions may be very &s;atal to &s;o rough a Draught as this is; but if I will believe, (as I am &s;ure I ought to do) all men that I have heard &s;peak of your Lord&s;hip, they bid me hope every thing from your Good|ne&s;s. This is that I mu&s;t &s;incerely own, which made me ex|tremely Ambitious of your Lord&s;hip's Patronage for this Piece. I am but too &s;en&s;ible, that there are a multitude of faults in it; but &s;ince the good nature of the Town has cover'd, or not taken notice of 'em, I mu&s;t have &s;o much di&s;cretion, as not to look with an affected nicety into 'em my &s;elf. With all the Faults and Imperfections which it may have, I mu&s;t own, I &s;hall be yet very well &s;atisfied with it, if it gives me an opportunity of reckoning my &s;elf from this time,</P>
