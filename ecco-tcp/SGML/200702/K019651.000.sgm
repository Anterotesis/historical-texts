<HEAD>THE OLD WHIG.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">On the State of the PEERAGE; with REMARKS upon the PLEBEIAN.</HEAD>
<P>_I Find that Men, who have turn'd their Thoughts to what is now the great Sub|ject, not only of our Parliamentary De|bates, but of our private Conver&s;ation, are apt to complain, it is a Matter of &s;uch a perplext Nature, and admits of &s;o many Arguments on either Side, that they are rather bewilder'd than in&s;tru|cted, by what they have heard in Di&s;cour&s;e, or &s;een in Print, upon this Occa&s;ion. But as, I think, this Per|plexity does not ari&s;e in Men's Minds from the Nature of the Thing it &s;elf, &s;o much as from the way of handling it; I &s;hall endeavour to draw out the whole State of this Af|fair with &s;uch Brevity and Method, as may neither tire nor puzzle the Reader; but carry his Thoughts through a Series of Ob&s;ervations and Arguments, that will regu|larly grow out of one another, and &s;et this Matter in its full Light.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e who are thought the be&s;t Writers upon Govern|ment, both Ancients and Moderns, have unanimou&s;ly a|greed in Opinion, that the mo&s;t perfect and rea&s;onable Form is a mixt Government, in oppo&s;ition to that of any &s;ingle Per&s;on, or any &s;ingle Order of Men. For whether the Supreme, that is, the Legi&s;lative Power be
<PB N="2" REF="4">
lodg'd entirely in a Prince, or in an Ari&s;tocracy, or in a Democracy, it is &s;till looked upon as Tyrannical, and not properly calculated for the Happine&s;s of the whole Com|munity.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;h'd as a Maxim among Political Writers, that the Divi&s;ion of the Supreme or Legi&s;lative Power is mo&s;t perfect, when it is di&s;tributed into three Branches. If it all centers in one Man, or in a Body of Men of the &s;ame Quality, it is that Form of Govern|ment which is call'd Tyrannical. If it be thrown into two Branches, it wants a ca&s;ting Power, and is under &s;uch a divided Authority as wou'd often draw two different Ways, and produce &s;ome time or other &s;uch a Di&s;cord as wou'd expo&s;e the Weaker to that which had mo&s;t Strength in it, and by degrees end in a &s;ingle Authority. If it con&s;i&s;t of four Branches, it wants likewi&s;e a ca&s;t|ing Power, and is liable to the &s;ame Inconveniences, as when it is compo&s;ed of Two. And if it be divided into Five, or more Parts, it nece&s;&s;arily runs into Confu&s;ion, and will not long retain either the Form, or the Name of Government. For this Rea&s;on, three Branches in a Le|gi&s;lature have been always fixed upon, as the proper Number; becau&s;e it affords a ca&s;ting Power, and may moderate any Heats in any two contending Branches, and overpower the Third in ca&s;e it &s;hould prove unrea&s;onable, or refu&s;e to come into Mea&s;ures apparently nece&s;&s;ary for the Good and Pre&s;ervation of the Community.</P>
<P N="3">3. The mo&s;t natural and equitable Divi&s;ion of the&s;e Three Branches of the Legi&s;lature, is the Regal, the Noble, and the Plebeian: Becau&s;e the whole Communi|ty is ca&s;t under the&s;e &s;everal Heads, and has not in it a &s;ingle Member who is without his Repre&s;entative in the Legi&s;lature of &s;uch a Con&s;itution.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="3" REF="5">
4. In the next place it is nece&s;&s;ary that the&s;e Three Branches &s;hould be entirely &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from each other, &s;o that no one of them may lie too much under the Influence and Controul of either of the col|lateral Branches. For if one part of the Legi&s;lature may any ways be inve&s;ted with a Power to force either of the other Two to concur with it, the Legi&s;lative Power is in Reality, whatever it may pretend to, divided into no more than Two Branches.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is the u&s;ual Boa&s;t of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> that our Go|vernment is fixed upon this triple Ba&s;is, which has been allowed even in Speculation, and that by Per&s;ons who could have no Eye to our Con&s;titution, a Form the mo&s;t accommodated to the Happine&s;s of a Commu|nity, and the mo&s;t likely to &s;tand &s;ecure in its own Strength. But if upon Examination one Branch of its Legi&s;lature is liable on any Occa&s;ion to be entirely ma|&s;ter'd and control'd by one of the other, it is certain that nothing can be more de&s;irable than &s;uch an Improve|ment in our Con&s;titution as may remove out of it this vi&s;ible Imperfection. If a King has Power, when he plea|&s;es, to add what Number he &s;hall think fit to a Body of Nobles, who have a Vote in the Legi&s;lature, it is plain he may &s;ecure his Point in that Branch of the Legi&s;lature, and by that Means command two Votes out of Three. This has made many a&s;&s;ert, and I wi&s;h I could hear a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer to it, that there are not properly more than Two Branches in our Legi&s;lature, notwith&s;tanding we flatter our &s;elves that they are Three.</P>
<P N="6">6. In this Ca&s;e, a precarious Power of Nobles, &s;o far &s;ubject to the Regal Power in their Legi&s;lative Capacity, might &s;ometimes be more pernicious to the Publick than if the Power of both the Branches were confe&s;&s;edly united
<PB N="4" REF="6">
in the Soveraign: Becau&s;e we might well &s;uppo&s;e a bad King would &s;carce venture upon &s;ome Things, were the whole Odium of them to turn upon him&s;elf; whereas a Body of Peerage, &s;hould they only be created in an Emergency to carry any unju&s;tifiable De&s;ign, would &s;erve to divert or &s;ilence the Murmurs of the Publick.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is a known Saying of a late <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> King, That if his Friends cou'd gain him a Hou&s;e of Commons, he wou'd throw his Troop of Guards into the Hou&s;e of Lords, rather than mi&s;carry in his Mea&s;ures. And whe|ther it is impo&s;&s;ible for a Court to gain a Hou&s;e of Com|mons of what Complection they plea&s;e, and what wou'd be the Con&s;equences at &s;ome time or other of their Suc|ce&s;s in &s;uch an Attempt, whil&s;t the Crown is po&s;&s;e&s;t of a certain Means, by Vertue of its Prerogative, of filling the Hou&s;e of Lords with its own Creatures, are Points too evident in them&s;elves to be in&s;i&s;ted upon.</P>
<P N="8">8. The foregoing Reflections are like fir&s;t Principles that have &s;carce been ever called into Di&s;pute, and have not only been the avowed Maxims of tho&s;e who have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Names of Whigs, but have fur|ni&s;hed Matter of Complaint to every Party in its Turn. This Power of the Prerogative has always occa&s;ion'd Murmurs, when either Side has found it exerted to their Prejudice. We have often wi&s;hed for a Redre&s;s of it, and have now an Opportunity of coming at it, which if we do not lay hold of is not likely to offer it &s;elf again &s;o long as we are a People.</P>
<P N="9">9. It is propos'd, to prevent tho&s;e many Inconveniences which may ari&s;e from an Arbitrary Creation of Peers, in what Proportion, and at what Time the Sovereign &s;hall plea&s;e, to re&s;train the Peers to a certain Number. It is evi|dent that &s;uch a Law wou'd remedy tho&s;e many Evils that
<PB N="5" REF="7">
may proceed from &s;uch &s;udden and numerous Additions which have been made to the Hou&s;e of Lords in the mo&s;t critical Conjunctures. But I find there are Objections made to this Expedient, from the Con&s;equences it wou'd have upon the Crown.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is repre&s;ented, That it will be the cutting off a Branch from the Prerogative. But if this be only the cut|ting off a Branch which is pernicious to the Publick, it is certainly a very good Argument for doing it, when we can: And that this Power is of &s;uch a Nature can &s;carce admit of a Di&s;pute. Be&s;ides, that the Crown, far from be|ing le&s;&s;en'd by it, will receive a greater Lu&s;tre, by par|ting with a Prerogative that has &s;o often given Offence, and may &s;ome Time turn to the De&s;truction of the Subject.</P>
<P N="11">11. The Crown, as a Branch of the Legi&s;lature, cannot de&s;ire a greater Prerogative than that of a Negative in the pa&s;&s;ing of a Law; and as it ought not to influence either Hou&s;e in their Debates, what can a good King de&s;ire more than the Power of approving or rejecting any &s;uch Bill, as cannot pa&s;s into a Law without the Royal A&s;&s;ent?</P>
<P N="12">12. The Crown will have &s;till all the Power in it of doing Good to the People, in which the Prerogative of our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Kings will be &s;till unlimited. In &s;hort, it nei|ther touches the Executive nor the Legi&s;lative Power of the Crown, nor takes away the Prerogative of creating Peers, but only of doing it in &s;uch a Manner as &s;eems repugnant to Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> King will &s;till be the Source of Nobility, and hold in him&s;elf the Prin|ciple of Peerage, though it is not to be lavi&s;h'd away on Multitudes, or given occa&s;ionally to the Detriment of the Publick.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="6" REF="8">
13. Be&s;ides, What do's the Crown do more in parting with a Branch of its Prerogative, than what the two other Parts of the Legi&s;lature have frequently done, with Re|gard to their re&s;pective Bodies, when they have found a|ny of their Rights or Privileges prejudicial to the Com|munity? All &s;uch &s;elf-denying Acts are of a popular Na|ture, and have been pa&s;&s;ed with the Good-liking and Ap|plau&s;e of their Fellow-Subjects. Nay the Crown has ne|ver more recommended it &s;elf to the Affection of the People, than when it has retrench'd it &s;elf in any exorbi|tance of Power that did not &s;eem con&s;i&s;tent with their Liberty; as in pa&s;&s;ing the Bill of <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> and that for e&s;tabli&s;hing Triennial Parliaments.</P>
<P N="14">14. Indeed were this a Point extorted from the Crown in its Nece&s;&s;ities, it might be generous at &s;uch a Juncture to appear in the Defence of the Prerogative; but this is not our Ca&s;e, we are only di&s;puting whether we &s;hall ac|cept of a voluntary Conce&s;&s;ion made by the Sovereign him&s;elf, who out of his unparallel'd Goodne&s;s has &s;hown, by this In&s;tance, that he places the true Dignity of a <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Monarch, where it always ought to be plac'd, in the Liberty of his People.</P>
<P N="15">15. Having con&s;idered this Alteration propo&s;ed to be made in our Con&s;titution with relation to the Crown, let us now con&s;ider it with regard fir&s;t to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, and in the next place to the whole Body of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commonalty; and if we find that it will prove advantageous in its Con&s;equences under both the&s;e Views, it is undoubtedly an Alteration very much to be wi&s;h'd for.</P>
<P N="16">16. The Number of Peers is in a few Reigns increa&s;ed from 59 to near 220, and there is no que&s;tion but that in as few
<PB N="7" REF="9">
&s;ucceeding Reigns their pre&s;ent Number will be doubled; nor will Po&s;terity be able to &s;ee an End of them, unle&s;s it be timely prevented. Nay, we have all the Rea&s;on in the World to apprehend that their Number will hereafter &s;well in greater Proportions than it has done hitherto. It is a general Remark, that &s;ince the Act has pa&s;&s;ed for Triennial Elections, Commoners of great E&s;tates are more de&s;irous than ever of gaining a Place in the Upper Hou&s;e, which will exempt them from &s;uch a con&s;tant De|pendance on their Electors, and the frequent Returns of Trouble and Expence in their Elections. At lea&s;t it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that every King will make &s;uch Addi|tions as will give his Friends a Majority; nay, if we may conclude from Experience, every Mini&s;ter who differs in his Politicks from his Predece&s;&s;or, will bring to his A&s;&s;i|&s;tance a &s;ufficient Number to turn the Ballance in his Fa|vour. And it is obvious to every one how quick is the Succe&s;&s;ion of Mini&s;ters in this Country.</P>
<P N="17">17. The fir&s;t good Con&s;equence therefore of the propo|&s;ed Alteration to the Hou&s;e of Commons will be this, That it will fill that Hou&s;e with Men of the large&s;t For|tunes, and the greate&s;t Abilities; for we may well &s;up|po&s;e that &s;uch Men will &s;et them&s;elves forward to be e|lected into &s;uch a Seat, when it is the highe&s;t Honour they can have immediately in their View. By this Means, tho&s;e will be the Repre&s;entatives of the People, who have the greate&s;t Stake among them. Tho&s;e will have the giving of Money in their Power, who have the mo&s;t of it in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But above all, the Influence of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and con&s;equently of all the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> will pre&s;erve its &s;elf in its due Strength; for, of all Maxims, none is more unconte&s;ted than that Power follows Property. But what additional Strength wou'd this give the Hou&s;e of Lords, if the rich|e&s;t Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons may be draught|ed
<PB N="8" REF="10">
out of it in &s;uch Numbers as the pre&s;ent Frame of our Con&s;titution permits? Nor wou'd the Inconvenience be le&s;s with re&s;pect to Men of great Parliamentary Abilities, if in&s;tead of continuing to add Weight and Authority to the Lower Hou&s;e, they may be called up at any time to employ the &s;ame Abilities in aggrandizing the Figure of another Hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="18">18. And as the propo&s;ed Alteration will be a proper Means to give a Figure to the Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;o will it likewi&s;e be an Expedient to pre&s;erve their Inte|grity, as it will take off one Method, and indeed the mo&s;t effectual Method, of bribing Men of over-grown Fortunes. When a Peerage dangles before the Eyes of the mo&s;t wealthy Commoner, it may have Charms in it to one, who would have a Contempt for any Offers of a|nother kind. A Man's Ambition is as &s;u&s;ceptible of Bribes as his Avarice, and it &s;hould be the Care of a Legi&s;|lature to cut off all Temptations to Corruption, in the one as well as the other. It is true, the Alteration pro|po&s;ed would not utterly remove the Influence of &s;uch a Motive, but it would certainly very much weaken it, and render it infinitely more ineffectual, than what it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="19">19. If this Method re&s;trains Men of the greate&s;t Figure of the Lower Hou&s;e from making their way &s;o ea&s;ily to the Upper, it will evidently tend to the bringing a great|er Number of Places of the highe&s;t Tru&s;t, Honour or Profit into the Hands of the mo&s;t able and wealthy Com|moners. Men &s;o accompli&s;h'd will have a diffu&s;ive Influence both in their own Hou&s;e, and in their re&s;pective Coun|tries, and it will be nece&s;&s;ary for all Governments to find out proper Rewards and Gratifications for &s;uch Men; and Gratifications of this kind no Commoner will envy them, &s;ince they enable them to be beneficial to the Body
<PB N="9" REF="11">
of People whom they Repre&s;ent, and do not in their Na|ture deprive us of their Strength and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in that Branch of the Legi&s;lature to which we belong.</P>
<P N="20">20. However, the propo&s;ed Re&s;traint on the Number of Peers, is far from being an Exclu&s;ion of &s;uch Com|moners, who are recommended by their Fortunes, or their Abilities. According to the Calculation generally receiv'd, there may happen two Extinctions or Va|cancies, taking one Year with another, in the Body of Peers, as fix'd and a&s;certain'd by the new Scheme, in ca&s;e it &s;hould obtain. And &s;urely the Commons of <HI>England</HI> will think it &s;ufficient to lo&s;e annually two of their mo&s;t con&s;iderable Members, whatever may be the Opinion of particular Per&s;ons, who are in ha&s;te to leave their Com|pany.</P>
<P N="21">21. A Re&s;traint upon the Number of the Lords will nece&s;&s;arily re&s;train the Influence of that Body in the E|lection of Members to &s;erve in the Lower Hou&s;e. It is very well known, that few Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons are advanc'd to Peerage, who have not one or more Corporations under their Direction: Nay, that very often, this is one Rea&s;on for their Promotion. If, there|fore, this perpetually increa&s;ing Body of Lords conti|nues on the Foot it is now, in Proportion as their Num|ber is augmented, their Influence in Elections will grow more general, till at length, as the Upper Hou&s;e are the Creature of the Crown, the Lower Hou&s;e may be in a great Mea&s;ure the Creature of the Lords: And it is worth while to con&s;ider, whether in Proce&s;s of Time, unle&s;s &s;ea&s;onably prevented, the Hou&s;e of Commons may not be filled with the Stewards and Bayliffs of our Peers.</P>
<P N="22">22. In the next Place, let us &s;ee what would be the Con&s;equences from &s;uch an Alteration, upon the whole
<PB N="10" REF="12">
Bulk of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commonalty, which &s;hou'd always find the fir&s;t Place in the Thoughts of their Repre&s;entatives. If they &s;hould gain only this &s;ingle Advantage, I think it is a very con&s;iderable One, that it will hinder the Nati|on from being over-run with Lords. We know that in the Sale of an E&s;tate, it is no &s;mall Recommendation to the Buyer, that there is no Lord within &s;o many Miles of it, and the Di&s;tance of &s;uch a Borderer is often look'd upon as an Equivalent to a Year's Purcha&s;e. But who can be &s;ecure from &s;uch a Neighbour, whil&s;t the Species is &s;o apt to increa&s;e and multiply? I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon paying of Debts, which is look'd upon as a moral Duty among Commoners, who cannot but be &s;orry to &s;ee any Additions to an Order of Men, that are &s;helter'd by Pri|vileges from the Demands of their hone&s;t and indu&s;trious Creditors. To which many Con&s;iderations of the like Nature might be added, were they not obvious to the private Reflection of every Reader.</P>
<P N="23">23. But the great Point, and which ought to carry the chief Weight with us in this Ca&s;e is, that the Alteration now propo&s;ed will give &s;uch a mighty Power to the Bulk of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commons, as can be never counter|ballanc'd by the Body of the Nobility. Should we &s;up|po&s;e 235 Peers po&s;&s;e&s;t, one with another, of 5000 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> this would amount to no more than 1175000 <HI>l. per Annum;</HI> and what is &s;uch a Property, and the Pow|er ari&s;ing out of it, compar'd with the Power ari&s;ing out of the Property of tho&s;e many Millions po&s;&s;e&s;t by the Com|mons? Be&s;ides, that the great Acce&s;&s;ions of Wealth yearly made in the Body of the Commons, would give it con|tinually an Increa&s;e of Property and Power, which wou'd accrue to the Body of the Nobles, in ca&s;e their Door was always open to Men of overflowing Fortunes, who might find no great Difficulty in procuring an Entrance.</P>
<P N="24"><PB N="11" REF="13">
24. I &s;hall now offer Two fair Que&s;tions to any Man, who impartially weighs the&s;e Matters.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, If two Schemes of Government were propos'd to him, in both of which the Legi&s;lature &s;hou'd con&s;i&s;t of three Branches, whether he wou'd prefer that Scheme, in which one of the Branches might be increas'd at Plea|&s;ure by another of them, or that Scheme in which every Branch &s;hould be limited to a certain &s;tated Number: Nay, if the two Schemes were placed in Parallel with one another, and con&s;ider'd in their re&s;pective Con&s;equences, whether the fir&s;t would not appear a mo&s;t wild and indi|ge&s;ted Project?</P>
<P>In the &s;econd Place I wou'd propo&s;e this Que&s;tion; If the Lords had been limited to a certain Number by our Con&s;titution, whether it would not have been thought unpardonable in any one who &s;hould have pro|pos'd to have taken off that Limitation, and left it to the Plea&s;ure of the Crown arbitrarily to add to them any Number at any Time?</P>
<P>No body can be at a lo&s;s to determine him&s;elf in the&s;e Que&s;tions, who con&s;iders this Subject by tho&s;e plain Lights, which are already exhibited in this Di&s;cour&s;e, and which may be &s;trengthen'd by many other Con&s;ide|rations.</P>
<P N="25">25. This Subject naturally engages me in one Task more, which is, to examine the Objections that have been &s;tarted again&s;t this Alteration propos'd to be made in the Con&s;titution of the Hou&s;e of Peers. And here I cannot di&s;cover any Inconvenience which can be &s;aid to follow from &s;uch an Alteration, that do's not now &s;ub&s;i&s;t, or is not an&s;wer'd by &s;ome much greater Inconvenience
<PB N="12" REF="14">
in the pre&s;ent State of the Peerage. But, that I may not follow the Example of tho&s;e who have appear'd in Print on the other &s;ide of this Debate, in putting weak Arguments into the Mouth of their Antagoni&s;ts, I &s;hall an&s;wer &s;uch Objections as have been the mo&s;t ap|proved by tho&s;e who declare them&s;elves again&s;t this Bill, as they are laid together in a Pamphlet, intitled <HI>The Plebeian.</HI></P>
<P N="26">26. As for the Introduction, the Digre&s;&s;ion upon the <HI>E|phori,</HI> and the concluding Paragraph, they are only Ar|guments <HI>ad conflandam invidiam,</HI> and &s;uch as are not to be an&s;wer'd by Rea&s;on, but by the &s;ame angry Strain in which they are Written, and which wou'd di&s;credit a Cau&s;e that is able to &s;upport it &s;elf without &s;uch an A&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P N="27">27. At fir&s;t Sight, &s;ays the <HI>Plebeian,</HI> this Propo&s;al mu&s;t appear very Shocking. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 3.</NOTE><HI>It carries with it too great an Alte|ration of the Con&s;titution.</HI> This is the fir&s;t general Ob|jection, and I wi&s;h it had been pur&s;ued regularly; but becau&s;e it is dropt and re&s;umed in the following Part of the Di&s;cour&s;e, I mu&s;t be forced to collect tho&s;e &s;catter'd Pa&s;&s;ages on this Head, as I find them in different Parts of the Book. This great Objection will be &s;ufficiently an|&s;wer'd, if this Alteration of the Con&s;titution is from Wor&s;e to Better; which I think has been fully proved. As every thing is formed into Perfection by Degrees, the Wi&s;dom of all Legi&s;latures has embraced every Opportunity of making &s;uch Changes in their Government, as have been advantageous to tho&s;e who live under it. This Author him|&s;elf gives us an eminent In&s;tance of a great Alteration of our Con&s;titution in the Lower Hou&s;e, under the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 9.</NOTE><HI>when the Crown erected &s;everal new Corporations, and relieved &s;everal ancient and decayed ones from &s;ending any Members at all.</HI> I do not make u&s;e of this Increa&s;e in the Number of
<PB N="13" REF="15">
the Commons, as an Argument for an Increa&s;e of the Number of the Lords, which the Author produces as the Rea&s;oning of &s;ome People who are for the Bill. Such People, if any there are, mu&s;t talk incon&s;i&s;tently with them&s;elves, &s;ince it is the Purport of the Bill to prevent the Hou&s;e of Lords from growing too Numerous. But it is an unan&s;werable Argument to &s;hew, that there has been as great an Alteration in one Branch of our Legi&s;la|ture, as is now propo&s;ed to be made in Another, and that &s;uch an Alteration &s;hould be introduc'd into our Form of Government, when there are good Rea&s;ons for it; on which Account our Author him&s;elf ju&s;tifies the above|mention'd Alteration in the Hou&s;e of Commons. Our Au|thor furni&s;hes us with another very good Argument in this Particular again&s;t him&s;elf. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 6.</NOTE><HI>Whiggi&s;m,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>if I under|&s;tand it aright, is a De&s;ire of Liberty, and a Spirit of Op|po&s;ition to all exorbitant Power in any part of the Con|&s;titution. Formerly the Danger on this Account was from the Crown; but &s;ince the</HI> Habeas Corpus <HI>Act, and the many Re&s;traints laid upon the Crown in King</HI> William<HI>'s Time, and the great and numerous Limitations of the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion Acts, the Prerogative of the Crown is reduced &s;o low, that it is not at all dangerous to the Commons.</HI> As we have the Author's Confe&s;&s;ion in the aforemention'd In&s;tance of an Alteration in the Plebeian, he has here given us an Account of as remarkable Changes in the Re|gal Branch of our Government. The Prerogative was re|trenched in tho&s;e &s;everal In&s;tances, becau&s;e without &s;uch Retrenchment the Power of it appeared exorbitant and dangerous to the Commons. If therefore there &s;till in|heres in the Crown a Power that is exorbitant and dan|gerous to the Commons, there is the &s;ame Rea&s;on why the Commons &s;hould lay hold of the pre&s;ent Opportuni|ty to retrench it. This is the Matter in Debate betwixt us; but be that as it will, the Argument which the Au|thor
<PB N="14" REF="16">
here makes u&s;e of, again&s;t the Bill in Que&s;tion, <HI>that it carries in it too great an Alteration of the Con&s;titution,</HI> would have been as good an Argument again&s;t the <HI>Ha|beas Corpus</HI> Act, or any other of tho&s;e above-mentioned. What is further &s;aid upon this Subject in P. 14. wou'd make a hand&s;ome Sentence in a popular Speech, but will never &s;tand the Te&s;t of a &s;trict Examination in a Di&s;cour&s;e addre&s;t to the Rea&s;ons and not the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men. <HI>In &s;hort it has been for our ancient Con&s;titution,</HI> &s;ays the Au|thor, <HI>that we have &s;truggled with &s;o much Vigour for many Years together: 'Tis for that we have pour'd out a River of</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Blood, and a Trea&s;ure unheard of in a|ny former Age. This Con&s;titution may have its Imper|fections; but faulty as it is, our Ance&s;tors have convey'd down Liberty to us thro' that Channel: And we ought to continue it on, as well as we can, to our Po&s;terity, and not give way to the new-modelling Schemes of every ex|traordinary Genius.</HI> This is not Arguing but Declaiming. Our Ance&s;tors remedied &s;everal Imperfections from time to time, and we are obliged to them for having convey|ed Liberty down to us through the Channel which they had &s;o often alter'd and reform'd. And will not our Po|&s;terity be as thankful to us, if we tran&s;mit to them their Liberty through the &s;ame Channel, when it &s;hall be only alter'd for the better Conveyance of it?</P>
<P N="28">28. Having taken off the Force of this main Objection, I &s;hall follow others as the Author leads me. He tells us that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 4.</NOTE><HI>the &s;hutting up the Door of the Hou&s;e of Lords in the manner talked of, cannot but prove a great Di&s;cou|ragement to virtuous Actions, to Learning and Indu&s;try, and very detrimental to the Hou&s;e of Peers it &s;elf, by preventing &s;uch frequent Supplies from going into it as the Nature of &s;uch a Body requires; for want of which, it may in time become corrupt and offen&s;ive like a &s;tagna|ted</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="17">
<HI>Pool, which hitherto has been pre&s;erved whole&s;ome and pure by the fre&s;h Streams that pa&s;s continually into it.</HI> This Con&s;ideration, if it has any Force, cuts down all the other Arguments drawn from the new Acce&s;&s;ions of Figure and Power, which he &s;uppo&s;es wou'd accrue to the Hou&s;e of Lords by the pa&s;&s;ing of the Bill &s;o much talked of. Can it be detrimental to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and at the &s;ame time throw into their Hands all the Places and Honours that the Crown can con&s;er upon them? Will that Body of Men, which wou'd become mean and de&s;picable and offen&s;ive as a &s;tagnated Pool by the Means of this Alteration, be rai&s;ed by the &s;ame Means to be the mo&s;t formidable, and the mo&s;t honoured Part in our Con&s;titution? Or could the &s;ame Body degenerate into a publick Nui&s;ance, as our Author repre&s;ents it, and at the &s;ame time be able to over-awe both King and Peo|ple? Can two fuch contrary Effects be produced from one and the &s;ame Cau&s;e? But could we &s;uppo&s;e that this Body of Men might thus degenerate; Wou'd they be a|ble, without numerous Recruits of Wealth, Learning and Indu&s;try, to oppo&s;e any thing for the Good of the Com|munity, in Contradiction to the King and People? But more of this hereafter.</P>
<P N="29">29. Our Author adds, <HI>I am not unaware it will be &s;aid that the frequent Extinctions of noble Families will &s;alve this Inconvenience, and make room for the rewarding of Merit. But,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>this Expedient, I fear, is not much to be depended on; for the &V;ncertainty of the Time when the Crown will have any &s;uch Power, will make it much the &s;ame, as if it were never to have it at all;</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, That unle&s;s the Crown has Power of making what Number of Lords it plea&s;es, and at what Time it plea&s;es, and to &s;erve what Turn it plea&s;es, it had as good have no Power at all of making Peers, which the Author &s;uppo&s;es is the only adequate Power it has of rewarding Merit. Not to
<PB N="16" REF="18">
ask the Author whether it be generally virtuous Actions, Learning, or Indu&s;try, that recommend Commoners to the Peerage, or of what other kind the Merit is, which has been often thus rewarded; I &s;hall only ask him, Whether any Man has &s;o crying a Merit as immediately requires a Peerage for its Reward? Or whether the Ex|tinction of Two Titles in a Year will not leave room e|nough for the Crown to reward tho&s;e extraordinary Per|&s;ons, who&s;e Merits give them &s;uch a Demand upon it? As for another Argument which the Author puts into the Mouth of tho&s;e whom he calls Patrons of the Bill pro|po&s;ed, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 4.</NOTE><HI>that it will ea&s;e the Crown of Importunities,</HI> as I think it has no great Weight in it, I am not concerned to urge any thing in its Defence again&s;t the <HI>Plebeian</HI>'s An&s;wer to it.</P>
<P N="30">30. We come now to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Paragraph of the whole Book, which I &s;hall therefore tran&s;cribe at length. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 5 <HI>and</HI> 6.</NOTE><HI>But another Con&s;equence of a much higher Na|ture, attending the Limitation of the Number of Peers, is the Danger there will be of changing the Con&s;titution by this means into an Ari&s;tocracy: And this may at any time in &s;uch ca&s;e be effected by the Confederacy of two or three Great Families, which would form &s;uch a Body in the Hou&s;e of Lords, as the Crown would not be able to controul. That this kind of Government is one of the wor&s;t Sorts of Knavery, is too well known to be di&s;puted. In a Democracy, a great many different Per&s;ons may come to have a Share of Power by &s;everal Incidents, but in the other ca&s;e it is Birth only that intitles to Su|periority: And the Milk &s;uch Nobles are nur&s;ed up with is Hatred and Contempt for every human Crea|ture, but tho&s;e of their own imaginary Dignity.</HI> The Que&s;tion to be &s;tated here is, Whether the Hou&s;e of Lords under their pre&s;ent Con&s;titution is not as likely to run into an Ari&s;tocracy, as it would be in
<PB N="17" REF="19">
ca&s;e their Number &s;hould be limited. It appears very plain to me, that a Body of Peers perpetually Increa|&s;ing, and capable of Additions, has in it a natural Ten|dency to an Ari&s;tocracy. Suppo&s;ing that the Hou&s;e of Lords from 60 Members is now &s;well'd to 200: The&s;e, if increa&s;ed by the &s;ame Proportion, wou'd in the &s;ame Number of Years amount to 666, to which we may pre&s;ume there wou'd be &s;till the like proportionable Ad|ditions. By this Means they would in time receive &s;uch va&s;t Acce&s;&s;ions of Property, as might Encourage them not only to entertain &s;o ambitious a De&s;ign, but in a great Mea&s;ure to render it effectual; e&s;pecially when any Men could be admitted into their own Order, with their great Abilities in Parliament, or their great Influ|ence among the People, who might be mo&s;t capable of oppo&s;ing their Incroachments upon the Commons. I do allow that &s;uch Additions would be prejudicial to the Crown; but, this is no Rea&s;on, why they would not be made, as it has not prevented the Additions that have been made in our own Memory. For tho' the Crown in general would be a Sufferer by this Method; yet it would naturally have Recour&s;e to it, as it has formerly, when it labours under any pre&s;ent Exigency, that can only be re|moved by &s;uch an Expedient. This Danger of an Ari|&s;tocracy, every one mu&s;t confe&s;s would be very much a|bated, and, I think, utterly removed, by the Limitation of the Lords to &s;uch a Number, as is now propo&s;ed. In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, their Property would be &s;o very incon&s;ide|rable, when compared with that of the Commons (as I have before &s;hew'd to a Demon&s;tration) that it would render &s;uch a De&s;ign in them the mo&s;t Chimerical, and the mo&s;t Impracticable. And &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible, that the whole Body of Lords in their United Strength could be able to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves into an Ari&s;tocracy, the Author's Imagination vani&s;hes, that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 5.</NOTE><HI>this may at any Time, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, be effected by the Confederacy of two or</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="20">
<HI>three great Families, which would form &s;uch a Body among the Lords, as the Crown would not be able to controul.</HI> If the Author means in this Place by the Crown not being able to controul the Lords, that it would be re&s;trained from pouring in &s;uch a Number as would al|ways &s;way them to its Inclinations, it is what ought to be wi&s;hed for. If he means, that this want of Power in the Crown would enable them to erect an Ari&s;tocracy, it is certainly a wrong Con&s;equence: Becau&s;e not only the Crown, but the People would have a Superior Power in them to the Body of Nobles, and are equally concern'd to pre&s;erve their Stations in the Government. The Author after this brings an Argument to prove, that an Ari&s;to|cracy is a bad Form of Government, and that a Demo|cracy is preferable to it, in which I entirely agree with him; but mu&s;t add, that a mixt Government made out of Ari&s;tocracy, Democracy and Monarchy, is better than either of them. The Author &s;ubjoins, that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 6.</NOTE><HI>the Milk which Nobles are nur&s;t up with is Hatred and Contempt of every Humane Creature, but tho&s;e of their own imagi|nary Dignity.</HI> If &s;o, the fewer of them the better. What Commoner wou'd not de&s;ire to put a &s;top to the Increa&s;e of them?</P>
<P N="31">31.

<P N="33">33. I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over another remarkable Paragraph of the Author upon the &s;ame Argument for increa&s;ing the Lords at Plea&s;ure. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 9.</NOTE><HI>The great Advantage,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that the Number of their Body cannot be increas'd, is at pre|&s;ent the mo&s;t valuable Privilege of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the only thing that makes them con&s;iderable.</HI> This is indeed a very poor Advantage, to found upon it the Gran|deur of a Hou&s;e of Commons. Is not the Power of gi|ving Money and rai&s;ing Taxes confin'd to that Body, and which can never fail to give them the greate&s;t Weight in the Legi&s;lature? Will not this be always the mo&s;t valua|ble Privilege of the Commons, and what other Privilege can make them more con&s;iderable? He goes on, <HI>The Lords are po&s;&s;e&s;t of many great Privileges that they will not permit the Commons to &s;hare with them; and therefore the Commons wou'd be highly wanting to them&s;elves, if</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="22">
<HI>they &s;hou'd add this Advantage likewi&s;e to the Lords, which is the only one that they can enjoy di&s;tinct from them.</HI> Our Author, as it may turn to his Account, &s;ometimes con|&s;iders the Lords in their per&s;onal Privileges as they are Individuals, and &s;ometimes as they are a Body of Men in the Legi&s;lature. If he here means their Privileges in the former View, I do allow they are very great ones, and therefore certainly every Commoner cannot de&s;ire an Encrea&s;e of &s;uch Individuals. But if he here means their Privileges as a Legi&s;lative Body, it is certain that all their Privileges together are not equal to that One, of com|manding the Pur&s;e of the Community. So that it is wonderful how he cou'd advance, that the Number of the Hou&s;e of Commons not being &s;ubject to an Increa&s;e, <HI>is the only Advantage that they enjoy di&s;tinct from the Hou&s;e of Lords.</HI></P>
<P N="34">34. Our Author next proceeds to &s;peak of the pro|portion of Property between the two Hou&s;es of Lords and Commons, which is a Point already &s;o fully di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed, that I &s;hall not trouble the Reader with any Re|petitions; but cannot omit what the Author a&s;&s;erts as an indi&s;putable Point, and which in it &s;elf is the greate&s;t Pa|radox I ever heard advanced. His Words are <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 10.</NOTE><HI>indeed if a re&s;training Bill &s;hou'd pa&s;s, I do not doubt but it wou'd be &s;oon follow'd with a Bill to prevent Lords from alie|nating their E&s;tates, for which many plau&s;ible Rea&s;ons are to be produc'd: And then without all Di&s;pute the Bal|lance of Property will be &s;oon turn'd on the &s;ide of their Lord&s;hips:</HI> Which is as much as to &s;ay, in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that the Lords will have as much Wealth among&s;t 'em as the whole Body of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commons, or that one Million will be a Balance again&s;t a hundred Millions. Indeed the Hou&s;e of Lords in their pre&s;ent Con&s;titution may be always approaching to a Balance in Property with the Commons, from whence they are continually re|ceiving
<PB N="21" REF="23">
into their Body &s;uch large Supplies; but if their Number be once limited, you cut off their Recruits, and lay them under an Impo&s;&s;ibility of ever rivalling the other Branch of the Legi&s;lature in this Particular.</P>
<P N="35">35. Our Author's Argument, that a new Power wou'd a|ri&s;e to the Hou&s;e of Lords from the Alteration &s;o much talked of, is founded upon a Fact which every one denies at fir&s;t &s;ight. His Words are the&s;e: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 10, 11.</NOTE><HI>For as to what is commonly &s;aid that the Lords wou'd get nothing, no new Power wou'd be added to them by this Means; I beg leave to &s;tate this Matter in a proper Light. Suppo&s;e the Bal|lance to be now</HI> even <HI>betwixt the Lords and the Crown, as it certainly is, or el&s;e the Con&s;titution wou'd not &s;ub|&s;i&s;t in quiet: Is it not plain to the mo&s;t common Capacity, that when two Scales are upon an equal Poi&s;e, if you take any Weight out of one of them, you give the Advantage to the other without putting any Thing into it.</HI> The Au|thor here &s;uppo&s;es that the Ballance between the&s;e two Parts of the Legi&s;lature <HI>&s;hould</HI> be even, and &s;o far I con|cur with him, that being the chief End which this Alte|ration has in view. But I can by no Means &s;uppo&s;e with him that they <HI>are</HI> even, becau&s;e it is contrary to Matter of Fact. For we plainly &s;ee that the Sovereign has it always in his Power to make what Divi&s;ion of Party or Opinion he plea&s;es prevail in that Hou&s;e. As for the Rea&s;on of their pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ed Equality, <HI>that other|wi&s;e they cou'd not &s;ub&s;i&s;t in quiet,</HI> it has no Force in it, becau&s;e we &s;ee very ill-con&s;tituted Governments will &s;ub&s;i&s;t in quiet for many Ages, not that they are pre|&s;erved by a rightly temper'd Con&s;titution, which wou'd give them the greate&s;t Strength, but by other accidental Cau&s;es.

36. I have now gone through every Thing that carries the Face of an Argument for the Con&s;titution of the Hou&s;e of Lords, as it now &s;tands, or of an Objection again&s;t the Alteration propo&s;ed to be made, having only avoid|ed &s;aying any thing in this Ca&s;e as it affects the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nobility, becau&s;e I have here con&s;ider'd it only as an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commoner, and becau&s;e I have Thoughts of pro|&s;ecuting the Subject, as it relates to <HI>Scotland,</HI> in another Pamphlet, being unwilling to &s;well this to a greater Bulk.</P>
<P N="37">37. Since the writing of the foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e, I have peru&s;ed a Pamphlet, intituled, <HI>The Thoughts of a Mem|ber of the Lower Hou&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. in which the Author fir&s;t approves our Con&s;titution as divided into its Three Branches, and through the whole Cour&s;e of his Book con|tends in Effect, that it &s;hou'd con&s;i&s;t of no more than Two; for he &s;uppo&s;es the Hou&s;e of Lords in&s;tituted only as Guar|dians, and Ornaments to the Throne, and to be augmen|ted by the Crown in &s;uch a Proportion, as may &s;trengthen it in Oppo&s;ition to the Hou&s;e of Commons.

<P N="38">38. Suppo&s;e, &s;ays the Objection, there &s;hould be an inflex|ible Ob&s;tinacy in a Hou&s;e of Peers, what Method would there be left to bring them to a Concurrence with the two other Branches of the Legi&s;lature, when it will not be in the Power of the King to bring them over to Rea|&s;on, by flinging in &s;ufficient Numbers among them? To this I an&s;wer, That if the Lords are ob&s;tinate in a Point, that is <HI>Rea&s;onable</HI> and <HI>Beneficial</HI> to the Community, it will be happy for their Country that they &s;hould be in|ve&s;ted with the proper Power of a Legi&s;lative Branch, not to be over-ruled to wrong Mea&s;ures. This may &s;ome|times be of great Advantage to the Publick, if we can po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e, that the two other Branches may con|cur in any thing that is not con&s;i&s;tent with Ju&s;tice, or the National Intere&s;t. If the Peers are thus inflexibly ob|&s;tinate in any Methods that are <HI>Di&s;honourable, &V;n|ju&s;t</HI> or <HI>Pernicions</HI> to their Country; can we imagine, they could not be influenced into a Compliance, by the Authority of the two &s;haring Branches in the Legi&s;la|ture? Or, can we think, they would per&s;i&s;t in Mea&s;ures which would draw upon them the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Crown, and the Re&s;entments of the whole Commons of <HI>Great Britain?</HI> Every Body of Men takes as much Care as po&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve their Credit, and to render

them&s;elves Popular; and we cannot think that any Branch of a Legi&s;lature would be made up of Madmen, or pur|&s;ue &s;uch Mea&s;ures as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily end in their Infamy, or their De&s;truction; e&s;pecially, when they are infinitely weaker than either of the other con|&s;tituent Parts of our Legi&s;lature. Could any Per&s;on ap|prehend &s;uch a Behaviour from them, I am &s;ure the &s;ame Per&s;on cannot in his Heart apprehend their growing up into an Ari&s;tocracy. The Peers are &s;o little a Match for the Crown in Power, or the Commons in Property, much le&s;s able to cope with the united Force of Both; that it is Wildne&s;s to &s;uppo&s;e them Guilty of &s;uch an unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable Ob&s;tinacy, as they know might en|danger their very Being in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution. And now, I &s;hall only propo&s;e it to every ones Thoughts, whether an Expedient, which will remedy the greate&s;t Inconvenience that may ari&s;e to us, from one of the Branches of the Legi&s;lature, and of which we have had Experience, as has been already &s;ufficiently explained, &s;hould prevail with us to lay it a&s;ide, out of a groundle&s;s Fear, that it &s;hould expo&s;e us to an Inconvenience from another Branch of the Legi&s;lature, which mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e 'em de&s;titute of common Sen&s;e, void of Honour and E|quity, and regardle&s;s of Self-pre&s;ervation, before it can po&s;&s;ibly befall us. To this I &s;hall only add, that whatever Objections are made again&s;t this Alteration in the Con|&s;titution may be made again&s;t every Form of Govern|ment, in which the Legi&s;lature con&s;i&s;ts of Three di&s;tinct Branches, and that is, again&s;t &s;uch a Form as has been pronounced the mo&s;t perfect, by tho&s;e who have been the mo&s;t skilful Politicians, and the mo&s;t famous for their Ob&s;ervations on the Nature of Government.</P>
