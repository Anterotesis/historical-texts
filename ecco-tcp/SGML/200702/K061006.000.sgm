<HEAD>THE SHORTEST-WAY WITH THE DISSENTERS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SIR <HI>Roger L'E&s;trange</HI> tell us a Story in his Collection of Fables, of the Cock and the Hor&s;es. The Cock was gotten to Roo&s;t in the Stable, among the Hor&s;es, and there be|ing no Racks, or other Conveniencies for him, it &s;eems, he was forc'd to roo&s;t upon the Ground; the Hor&s;es jo&s;tling about for room, and putting the Cock in danger of his Life, he gives them this grave Advice; <HI>Pray Gentlefolks let us &s;tand &s;till, for fear we &s;hould tread upon one another.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">THERE are &s;ome People in the World, who now they are <HI>unpearcht,</HI> and reduc'd to an E|quality with other People, and under &s;trong and very ju&s;t Apprehen&s;ions of being further treat|ed as they de&s;erve, begin with <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s-Cock, to Preach up Peace and Union, and the Chri&s;tian Duties of Moderation, forgetting, that when they had the Power in their Hands, tho&s;e Graces were Strangers in their Gates.</P>
<P>It is now near Fourteen Years, that the Glo|ry and Peace of the pure&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Church in the World has been Ecclips'd, Buf|fetted, and Di&s;turb'd, by a &s;ort of Men, who God in his Providence has &s;uffer'd to in&s;ult o|ver her, and bring her down; the&s;e have been the Days of her Humiliation and Tribulation: She has born with an invincible Patience the Re|proach of the Wicked, and God has at la&s;t heard her Prayers, and deliver'd her from the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Stranger.</P>
<P>And now they find their Day is over, their Power gone, and the Throne of this Nation po&s;|&s;e&s;t by a Royal, <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> True, and ever Con|&s;tant Member of, and Friend to the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Now they find that they are in danger of the Church of <HI>England</HI>'s ju&s;t Re&s;ent|ments;
<PB N="3" REF="5">
now they cry out <HI>Peace, &V;nion, Forbear|ance,</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> as if the Church had not too long harbour'd her Enemies under her Wing, and nouri&s;h'd the viperous Brood, till they hi&s;s and fly in the Face of the Mother that cheri&s;h'd them.</P>
<P><HI>No Gentlemen,</HI> the Time of Mercy is pa&s;t, your <HI>Day of Grace is over</HI>; you &s;hou'd have practis'd Peace, and Moderation, and Charity, if you ex|pected any your &s;elves.</P>
<P>We have heard none of this Le&s;&s;on for Four|teen Years pa&s;t: We have been huff'd and bul|ly'd with your Act of Tolleration; you have told us that you are the <HI>Church e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law,</HI> as well as others; have &s;et up your Canting-Synagogues at our Church-Doors, and the Church and her Members have been loaded with Re|proaches, with Oaths, A&s;&s;ociations, Abjurations, and what not; where has been the Mercy, the Forbearance, the Charity you have &s;hewn to <HI>ten|der Con&s;ciences of the Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> that cou'd not take Oaths <HI>as fa&s;t as you made 'em</HI>; that having &s;worn Allegiance to their lawful and rightful King, cou'd not di&s;pence with that Oath, <HI>their King being &s;till alive,</HI> and &s;wear to your new <HI>Hodge-podge of a Dutch-Government.</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="6">
The&s;e ha' been turn'd out of their Livings, and they and their Families left to &s;tarve; their E|&s;tates double Tax'd, to carry on a War they had <HI>no Hand in,</HI> and you <HI>got nothing by</HI>: What Account can you give of the Multitudes you have forc'd to comply, again&s;t their Con&s;ciences, with your new <HI>&s;ophi&s;tical Politicks,</HI> who like the new Converts in <HI>France,</HI> Sin becau&s;e they can't Starve. And now the Tables are turn'd upon you, you <HI>mu&s;t not be Per&s;ecuted, 'tis not a Chri|&s;tian Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>You have <HI>Butcher'd</HI> one King, <HI>Depos'd</HI> another King, and made a <HI>mock King</HI> of a Third; and yet you cou'd have the Face to expect to be employ'd and tru&s;ted by the Fourth; any body that did not know the Temper of your Party, wou'd &s;tand amaz'd at the Impudence, as well as Folly, to think of it.</P>
<P>Your Management of your <HI>Dutch Monarch,</HI> whom you reduc'd to a meer <HI>King of Cl&mdash;s,</HI> is enough to give any future Princes &s;uch an Idea of your Principles, as to warn them &s;ufficiently from coming into your Clutches; and God be thank'd, the Queen is out of your Hands, knows you, and will have a care of you.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">There is no doubt but the &s;upreme Autho|rity of a Nation has in its &s;elf a Power, <HI>and a Right to that Power,</HI> to execute the Laws upon any Part of that Nation it governs. The exe|cution of the known Laws of the Land, and that with but a weak and gentle Hand neither, was all that the phanatical Party of this Land have ever call'd Per&s;ecution; this they have magnifi|ed to a height, that the Sufferings of the <HI>Hugonots</HI> in <HI>France</HI> were not to be compar'd with&mdash; Now to execute the known Laws of a Nation upon tho&s;e who tran&s;gre&s;s them, after having fir&s;t been voluntarily con&s;enting to the making tho&s;e Laws, can never be call'd Per|&s;ecution, but Ju&s;tice. But Ju&s;tice is always Violence to the Party offending, for every Man is Innocent in his own Eyes. The fir&s;t execution of the Laws again&s;t Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> was in the Days of King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t; and what did it amount to, truly, the wor&s;t they &s;uffer'd, was at their own reque&s;t, to let them go to <HI>New-England,</HI> and erect a new Collony, and give them great Privileges, Grants, and &s;uitable Pow|ers, keep them under Protection, and defend them again&s;t all Invaders, and receive no Taxes or Revenue from them. This was the cruelty
<PB N="6" REF="8">
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> fatal Lenity! 'Twas the ruin of that excellent Prince, King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t. Had King <HI>James</HI> &s;ent all the Puritans in <HI>England</HI> away to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> we had been a national unmix'd Church; the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> had been kept undivided and entire.</P>
<P>To requite the Lenity of the Father, they take up Arms again&s;t the Son; Conquer, Pur|&s;ue, Take, Impri&s;on, and at la&s;t put to Death the anointed of God, and De&s;troy the very Being and Nature of Government, &s;etting up a &s;ordid Impo&s;tor, who had neither Title to Govern, nor Under&s;tanding to Manage, but &s;upplied that want with Power, bloody and de&s;perate Councils and Craft, without Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Had not King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t witheld the full execution of the Laws; had he given them &s;trict Ju&s;tice, he had clear'd the Nation of them, and the Con&s;equences had been plain; his <HI>Son had never been murther'd by them,</HI> nor the Monar|chy overwhelm'd; 'twas <HI>too much Mercy</HI> &s;hewn them, was the ruin of his Po&s;terity, and the ruin of the Nation's Peace. One would think the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould not have the Face to believe that we are to be wheedl'd and canted into Peace and Toleration, when they know that they
<PB N="7" REF="9">
have once requited us with a civil War, and once with an intollerable and unrighteous Per&s;e|cution for our former Civillity.</P>
<P>Nay, to encourage us to be Ea&s;y with them, 'tis apparent, that they never had the Upper-hand of the Church, but they treated her with all the Severity, with all the Reproach and Con|tempt as was po&s;&s;ible: What Peace, and what Mercy did they &s;hew the Loyal Gentry of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in the time of their Trium|phant Common-wealth? How did they put all the Gentry of <HI>England</HI> to ran&s;om, whether they were actually in Arms for the King or not, making People compound for their E&s;tates, and &s;tarve their Families? How did they treat the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;eque&s;ter'd the Mini&s;ters, devour'd the Patrimony of the Church, and divided the Spoil, by &s;haring the Church-Lands among their Soldiers, and turning her Clergy out to &s;tarve; ju&s;t &s;uch Mea&s;ure as they have mete, &s;hou'd be mea&s;ur'd to them again.</P>
<P>Charity and Love is the known Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and 'tis plain &s;he has put it in practice towards the Di&s;&s;enters, even beyond what they ought, till &s;he has been want|ing to her &s;elf, and in effect, unkind to her
<PB N="8" REF="10">
own Sons; particularly, in the too much Leni|ty of King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, mentioned before, had he &s;o rooted the Puritans from the Face of the Land, which he had an opportunity ear|ly to ha' done, they had not the Power to vex the Church, as &s;ince they have done.</P>
<P>IN the Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, how did the Church reward their bloody Do|ings with Lenity and Mercy, <HI>except the barbar|ous Regicides of the pretended Court of Ju&s;tice</HI>; not a Soul &s;uffer'd for all the Blood in an un|natural War: King <HI>Charles</HI> came in all Mer|cy and Love, cheri&s;h'd them, preferr'd them, employ'd them, witheld the rigour of the Law, and oftentimes, even again&s;t the Advice of his Parliament, gave them liberty of Con&s;cience; and how did they requite him with the vil|lainous Contrivance to Depo&s;e and Murther him and his Succe&s;&s;or at the <HI>Rye-Plot.</HI></P>
<P>KING <HI>James,</HI> as if Mercy was the inhe|rent Quality of the Family, began his Reign with unu&s;ual Favour to them: Nor could their join|ing with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> again&s;t him, move him to do him&s;elf Ju&s;tice upon them; but that mi&s;|taken
<PB N="9" REF="11">
Prince thought to win them by Gentle|ne&s;s and Love, proclaim'd an univer&s;al Liberty to them, and rather di&s;countenanc'd the Church of <HI>England</HI> than them; how they requited him all the World knows.</P>
<P>THE late Reign is too fre&s;h in the Me|mory of all the World to need a Comment; how under Pretence of joining with the Church in redre&s;&s;ing &s;ome Grievances, they pu&s;ht things to that extremity, in conjunction with &s;ome mi&s;|taken Gentlemen, as to Depo&s;e the late King, as if the Grievance of the Nation cou'd not ha' been redre&s;s'd but by the ab&s;olute ruin of the Prince: Here's an In&s;tance of their Temper, their Peace, and Charity. To what height they carried them&s;elves during the Reign of a King of their own; how they crope into all Places of Tru&s;t and Profit; how they in&s;inuated into the Favour of the King, and were at fir&s;t pre|ferr'd to the highe&s;t Places in the Nation; how they engro&s;t the Mini&s;try, and <HI>above all, how pitifully they Manag'd,</HI> is too plain to need any Remarks.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12">BUT particularly, their Mercy and Chari|ty, the Spirit of Union, they tell us &s;o much of, has been remarkable in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if any Man wou'd &s;ee the Spirit of a Di&s;&s;enter, let him look into <HI>Scotland</HI>; there they made an entire Conque&s;t of the Church, trampled down the &s;acred Orders, and &s;uppre&s;t the Epi&s;copal Go|vernment, with an ab&s;olute, and as they &s;up|po&s;e, irretrievable Victory, tho', 'tis po&s;&s;ible, <HI>they may find them&s;elves mi&s;taken</HI>: Now 'twou'd be a very proper Que&s;tion to ask their <HI>Impudent Advocate, the Ob&s;ervator,</HI> Pray how much Mercy and Favour did the Members of the Epi&s;copal Church find in <HI>Scotland,</HI> from the <HI>Scotch</HI> Pres|byterian-Government; and I &s;hall undertake for the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hall &s;till receive as much here, tho' they de&s;erve but little.</P>
<P>In a &s;mall Treati&s;e of the Sufferings of the Epi&s;copal Clergy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> 'twill appear, what U&s;age they met with, how they not only lo&s;t their Livings, but in &s;everal Places, were plun|der'd and abus'd in their Per&s;ons; the Mini|&s;ters that cou'd not conform, turn'd out, with numerous Families, and no Maintenance, and hardly Charity enough left to relieve them with
<PB N="11" REF="13">
a bit of Bread; and the Cruelties of the Party are innumerable, and not to be attempted in this &s;hort Piece.</P>
<P>And now to prevent the di&s;tant Cloud which they perceiv'd to hang over their Heads from <HI>England</HI>; with a true Presbyterian Policy, they put in for <HI>a union of Nations,</HI> that <HI>England</HI> might unite their Church with the Kirk of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and their Presbyterian Members &s;it in our Hou&s;e of Commons, and their A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Scotch</HI> canting Long-Cloaks in our Convocation; what might ha' been, if our Phanatick, Whiggi&s;h-States-men had continu'd, God only knows; but we hope we are out of fear of that now.</P>
<P>'Tis alledg'd by &s;ome of the Faction, and they began to Bully us with it; that if we won't unite with them, they will not &s;ettle the Crown with us again, but when her Maje&s;ty dies, will chu&s;e a King for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>If they won't, we mu&s;t make them, and 'tis not the fir&s;t time we have let them know that we are able: The Crowns of the&s;e Kingdoms have not &s;o far di&s;owned the right of Succe&s;|&s;ion, but they may retrieve it again, and if <HI>Scotland</HI> thinks to come off from a Succe&s;&s;ive to an Elective State of Government, <HI>England</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="14">
has not promi&s;ed not to a&s;&s;i&s;t the right Heir, and put them into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, without any re|gard to their ridiculous Settlements.</P>
<P>THESE are the Gentlemen, the&s;e their ways of treating the Church, both at home and abroad. Now let us examine the Rea&s;ons they pretend to give why we &s;hou'd be favourable to them, why we &s;hould continue and tolle|rate them among us.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THEY are very Numerous, they &s;ay, they are a great Part of the Nation, and we cannot &s;uppre&s;s them.</P>
<P>To this may be an&s;wer'd 1. THEY are not &s;o Numerous as the Prote&s;tants in <HI>France,</HI> and yet the <HI>French</HI> King effectually clear'd the Nation of them at once, and we don't find he mi&s;&s;es them at home.</P>
<P>But I am not of the Opinion they are &s;o Numerous as is pretended; their Party is more Numerous than their Per&s;ons, and tho&s;e mi&s;taken People of the Church, who are mi&s;led and de|luded by their wheedling Artifices, to join with them, make their Party the greater; but tho&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="15">
will open their Eyes, when the Government &s;hall &s;et heartily about the work, and come off from them, as &s;ome Annimals, which they &s;ay, always de&s;ert a Hou&s;e when 'tis likely to fall.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> The more Numerous, the more Danger|ous, and therefore the more need to &s;uppre&s;s them; and God has &s;uffer'd us to bear them as Goads in our &s;ides, for not utterly extingui&s;hing them long ago.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> If we are to allow them, only becau&s;e we cannot &s;uppre&s;s them, then it ought to be tryed whether we can or no; and I am of Opinion 'tis ea&s;y to be done, and cou'd pre&s;cribe Ways and Means, if it were proper, but I doubt not but the Government will find effectual Me|thods for the rooting the Contagion from the Face of this Land.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Argument they u&s;e, which is this, That 'tis a time of War, and we have need to unite again&s;t the common Enemy.</P>
<P>WE an&s;wer, this common Enemy had been no Enemy, if they had not made him &s;o; he was quiet, in peace, and no way di&s;turb'd, or
<PB N="14" REF="16">
encroach'd upon us, and we know no rea&s;on we had to quarrel with him.</P>
<P>But further, We make no que&s;tion but we are able to deal with this common Enemy with|out their help; but why mu&s;t we unite with them becau&s;e of the Enemy, will they go over to the Enemy, if we do not prevent it by a union with them&mdash; We are very well contented they &s;hou'd; and make no que&s;tion, we &s;hall be ready to deal with them and the common E|nemy too, and better without them than with them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if we have a common Enemy, there is the more need to be &s;ecure again&s;t our pri|vate Enemies; if there is one common Ene|my, we have the le&s;s need to have an Enemy in our Bowels.</P>
<P>'Twas a great Argument &s;ome People u&s;ed again&s;t &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Old-Money, that 'twas a time of War, and 'twas too great a Ri&s;que for the Nation to run, if we &s;hou'd not ma&s;ter it, we &s;hou'd be undone; and yet the Sequel prov'd the Hazard was not &s;o great, but it might be ma&s;tered; and the Succe&s;s was an&s;werable. The &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Di&s;&s;enters is not a harder Work, nor a Work of le&s;s nece&s;&s;ity to the Pub|lick;
<PB N="15" REF="17">
we can never enjoy a &s;ettled uninterrupted Union and Tranquility in this Nation, till the Spirit of Whiggi&s;me, Faction, and Schi&s;m is melted down like the Old-Money.</P>
<P>To talk of the Difficulty, is to Frighten our &s;elves with Chimaeras and Notions of a Power|ful Party, which are indeed a Party without Power; Difficulties often appear greater at a di&s;tance, than when they are &s;earch'd into with Judgment, and di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the Vapours and Shadows that attend them.</P>
<P>We are not to be frightned with it; this Age is wi&s;er than that, by all our own Experience, <HI>and theire's too</HI>; King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, had early &s;up|pre&s;t this Party, if he had took more deliberate Mea|&s;ures. In &s;hort, 'tis not worth arguing, to talk of their Arms, their <HI>Monmouths,</HI> and <HI>Shaftsburys,</HI> and <HI>Argiles</HI> are gone, their <HI>Dutch-Sanctuary</HI> is at an end, Heaven has made way for their De&s;truction, and if we do not clo&s;e with the Divine occa&s;ion, we are to blame our &s;elves, and may remember that we had once an opportunity to &s;erve the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> by extirpating her implacable Enemies, and having let &s;lip the Minute that Heaven pre&s;ented, may experimentally Complain, <HI>Po&s;t e&s;t Occa&s;io Calvo.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">Here are &s;ome popular Objections in the way.</P>
<P>As fir&s;t, THE Queen has promis'd them, to continue them in their tollerated Liberty; and has told us &s;he will be a religious Ob&s;erver of her Word.</P>
<P>WHAT her Maje&s;ty will do we cannot help, but what, as the Head of the Church, &s;he ought to do, is another Ca&s;e: Her Ma|je&s;ty has promi&s;ed to Protect and Defend the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and if &s;he cannot effectual|ly do that without the De&s;truction of the Di&s;|&s;enters, &s;he mu&s;t of cour&s;e di&s;pence with one Promi&s;e to comply with another. But to an|&s;wer <HI>this Cavil more effectually</HI>: Her Maje&s;ty did never promi&s;e to maintain the Tolleration, to the De&s;truction of the Church; but it is upon &s;uppo&s;ition that it may be compatible with the well being and &s;afety of the Church, which &s;he had declar'd &s;he would take e&s;pecial Care of: Now if the&s;e two Intere&s;ts cla&s;h, 'tis plain her Maje&s;ties Intentions are to Uphold, Pro|tect, Defend, and E&s;tabli&s;h the Church, and this we conceive is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">Perhaps it may be &s;aid, THAT the Church is in no immediate danger from the Di&s;|&s;enters, and therefore 'tis time enough: But this is a weak An&s;wer.</P>
<P>For fir&s;t, IF a Danger be real, the Di&s;tance of it is no Argument again&s;t, but rather a Spur to quicken us to prevention, le&s;t it be too late hereafter.</P>
<P>And 2dly, Here is the Opportunity, and the only one perhaps that ever the Church had to &s;ecure her &s;elf, and de&s;troy her Enemies.</P>
<P>The Repre&s;entatives of the Nation have now an Opportunity, the Time is come which all good Men ha' wi&s;h'd for, that the Gentlemen of <HI>England</HI> may &s;erve the Church of <HI>England</HI>; now they are protected and encouraged by a Church of <HI>England</HI> Queen.</P>
<P><HI>What will ye do for your Si&s;ter in the Day that &s;he &s;hall be &s;poken for.</HI></P>
<P>If ever you will e&s;tabli&s;h the be&s;t Chri&s;tian Church in the World.</P>
<P>If ever you will &s;uppre&s;s the Spirit of Enthu|&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">If ever you will free the Nation from the viper|ons Brood that have &s;o long &s;uck'd the Blood of their Mother.</P>
<P>If you will leave your Po&s;terity free from Faction and Rebellion, this is the time.</P>
<P>This is the time to pull up this heretical Weed of Sedition, that has &s;o long di&s;turb'd the Peace of our Church, and poi&s;oned the good Corn.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;ays another Hot and Cold Object|or, this is renewing Fire and Faggot, reviv|ing the Act <HI>De Heret. Comburendo</HI>: This will be Cruelty in its Nature, and Barbarous to all the World.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, 'TIS Cruelty to kill a Snake or a Toad in cold Blood, but the Poy&s;on of their Nature makes it a Charity to our Neighbours, to de&s;troy tho&s;e Creatures, not for any per&s;onal Injury receiv'd, but for prevention; not for the Evil they have done, but the Evil they may do.</P>
<P>Serpents, Toads, Vipers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are noxious to the Body, and poi&s;on the &s;en&s;ative Life; the&s;e poy&s;on the Soul, corrupt our Po&s;terity, en&s;nare our Children, de&s;troy the Vitals of our Happy|ne&s;s,
<PB N="19" REF="21">
our future Felicity, and contaminate the whole Ma&s;s.</P>
<P>Shall any Law be given to &s;uch wild Crea|tures: Some Bea&s;ts are for Sport, and the Hunt&s;men give them advantages of Ground; but &s;ome are knock'd on Head by all po&s;&s;ible ways of Violence and Surprize.</P>
<P>I do not pre&s;cribe Fire and Fagot, but a <HI>Sci|pio</HI> &s;aid of <HI>Carthage, Dilenda e&s;t Carthago</HI>; they are to be rooted out of this Nation, if ever we will live in Peace, &s;erve God, or enjoy our own: As for the Manner, I leave it to tho&s;e Hands who have a right to execute God's Ju&s;tice on the Nation's and the Church's Enemies.</P>
<P>BUT if we mu&s;t be frighted from this Ju&s;tice, under the &s;pecious Pretences, and odious Sen&s;e of Cruelty, nothing will be effected: 'Twill be more Barbarous and Cruel to our own Chil|dren, and dear Po&s;terity, when they &s;hall reproach their Fathers, as we do ours, and tell us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'You had an Opportunity to root out this cur&s;ed Race from the World, under the Favour and Protection of a true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Queen; and out of your fooli&s;h Pity you &s;pared them, be|cau&s;e, for&s;ooth, you would not be Cruel, and

now our Church is &s;uppre&s;t and per&s;ecuted, our Religion trampl'd under Foot, our E&s;tates plun|dred, our Per&s;ons impri&s;oned and dragg'd to Jails, Gibbets, and Scaffolds; your &s;paring this <HI>Amalakite</HI> Race is our De&s;truction, your Mer|cy to them proves Cruelty to your poor Po&s;te|rity.'</Q></P>
<P>HOW ju&s;t will &s;uch Reflections be, when our Po&s;terity &s;hall fall under the mercile&s;s Clut|ches of this uncharitable Generation, when our Church &s;hall be &s;wallow'd up in Schi&s;m, Facti|on, Enthu&s;ia&s;me, and Confu&s;ion; when our Go|vernment &s;hall be devolv'd upon Foreigners, and our Monarchy dwindled into a Republick.</P>
<P>'Twou'd be more rational for us, if we mu&s;t &s;pare this Generation, to &s;ummon our own to a general Ma&s;&s;acre, and as we have brought them into the World Free, &s;end them out &s;o, and not betray them to De&s;truction by our &s;upine negligence, and then cry <HI>it is Mercy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a merciful meek Man, and yet with what Fury did he run thro' the Camp, and cut the Throats of Three and thirty thou&s;and of his dear <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> that were fallen into Idolatry; what was the rea&s;on? 'twas Mercy to the re&s;t,
<PB N="21" REF="23">
to make the&s;e be Examples, to prevent the De|&s;truction of the whole Army.</P>
<P>How many Millions of future Souls we &s;ave from Infection and Delu&s;ion, if the pre&s;ent Race of poi&s;on'd Spirits were purg'd from the Face of the Land.</P>
<P>'TIS vain to trifle in this matter, the light fooli&s;h handling of them by Mulcts, Fines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 'tis their Glory and their Advantage; if the Gallows in&s;tead of the Counter, and the Gal|lies in&s;tead of the Fines, were the Reward of going to a Conventicle, to preach or hear, there wou'd not be &s;o many Sufferers, the Spirit of Martyrdom is over; they that will go to Church to be cho&s;en Sheriffs and Mayors, would go to forty Churches rather than be Hang'd.</P>
<P>If one &s;evere Law were made, and punctually executed, that who ever was found at a Con|venticle, &s;hou'd be Bani&s;hed the Nation, and the Preacher be Hang'd, we &s;hou'd &s;oon &s;ee an end of the Tale, they wou'd all come to Church; and one Age wou'd make us all One again.</P>
<P>TO talk of 5 <HI>s.</HI> a Month for not coming to the Sacrament, and 1 <HI>s. per</HI> Week for not com|ing
<PB N="22" REF="24">
to Church, this is &s;uch a way of convert|ing People as never was known, this is felling them a Liberty to tran&s;gre&s;s for &s;o much Mo|ney: If it be not a Crime, why don't we give them full Licence? And if it be, no Price ought to compound for the committing it, for that is &s;elling a Liberty to People to &s;in again&s;t God and the Government.</P>
<P>If it be a Crime of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence, both again&s;t the Peace and Welfare of the Na|tion, the Glory of God, the Good of the Church, and the Happyne&s;s of the Soul, let us rank it among capital Offences, and let it receive a Puni&s;h|ment in proportion to it.</P>
<P>We Hang Men for Trifles, and Bani&s;h them for things not worth naming, but an Offence again&s;t God and the Church, again&s;t the Wel|fare of the World, and the Dignity of Religi|on, &s;hall be bought off for 5 <HI>s.</HI> this is &s;uch a &s;hame to a Chri&s;tian Government, that 'tis with regret I tran&s;mit it to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>IF Men &s;in again&s;t God, affront his Ordi|nances, rebell again&s;t his Church, and di&s;obey the Precepts of their Superiors, let them &s;uffer as &s;uch capital Crimes de&s;erve, &s;o will Religi|on
<PB N="23" REF="25">
on flouri&s;h, and this divided Nation be once again united.</P>
<P>And yet the Title of Barbarous and Cruel will &s;oon be taken off from this Law too. I am not &s;uppo&s;ing that all the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Eng|land</HI> &s;hou'd be Hang'd or Bani&s;h'd, but as in ca&s;es of Rebellions and In&s;urrections, if a few of the Ring-leaders &s;uffer, the Multitude are di&s;|mi&s;t, &s;o a few ob&s;tinate People being made Examples there's no doubt but the Severity of the Law would find a &s;top in the Compliance of the Multitude.</P>
<P>To make the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this matter out of que&s;tion, and more unan&s;werably plain, let us examine for what it is that this Nation is divided into Parties and Factions, and let us &s;ee how they can ju&s;tify a Separation, or we of the Church of <HI>England</HI> can ju&s;tify our bearing the In&s;ults and Inconveniencies of the Party.</P>
<P>ONE of their leading Pa&s;tors, and a Man of as much Learning as mo&s;t among them, in his An&s;wer to a Pamphlet, entituled, <HI>A En|quiry into the occa&s;ional Conformity,</HI> hath the&s;e Words, P. 27 <HI>Do the Religion of the Church and the Meeting-hou&s;es make two Religions? Where|in</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="26">
<HI>do they differ? The Sub&s;tance of the &s;ame Reli|gion is common to them both; and the Modes and Accidents are the things in which only they differ.</HI> P. 28 <HI>Thirty nine Articles are given us for the &s;ummary of our Religion, Thirty &s;ix contain the Sub&s;tance of it, wherein we agree; Three the additional Appendices, about which we have &s;ome differences.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if as by their own acknowledgment, the Church of <HI>England</HI> is a true Church, and the Difference between them is only a few <HI>Modes and Accidents,</HI> Why &s;hou'd we expect that they will &s;uffer Gallows and Gallies, cor|poreal Puni&s;hment and Bani&s;hment for the&s;e Trifles; there is no que&s;tion but they will be wi&s;er; even their own Principles won't bear them out in it, they will certainly comply with the Laws, and with Rea&s;on, and tho' at the fir&s;t, Severity may &s;eem hard, the next Age will feel nothing of it; the Contagion will be rooted out; the Di&s;ea&s;e being cur'd, there will be no need of the Operation, but if they &s;hould ven|ture to trangre&s;s, and fall into the Pit, all the World mu&s;t condemn their Ob&s;tinacy, as being without Ground from their own Principles.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">Thus the Pretence of Cruelty will be taken off, and the Party actually &s;uppre&s;t, and the Di&s;quiets they have &s;o often brought upon the Na|tion, prevented.</P>
<P>THEIR Numbers, and their Wealth, makes them Haughty, and tha tis &s;o far from being an Argument to per&s;wade us to forbear them, that 'tis a Warning to us, without any more delay, to reconcile them to the Unity of the Church, or remove them from us.</P>
<P>AT pre&s;ent, Heaven be prais'd, they are not &s;o Formidable as they have been, and 'tis our own fault if ever we &s;uffer them to be &s;o; Providence, and the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;eems to join in this particular, that now the De&s;troy|ers of the Nations Peace may be overturn'd, and to this end the pre&s;ent Opportunity &s;eems to be put into our Hands.</P>
<P>To this end her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty &s;eems re&s;erv'd to enjoy the Crown, that the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick as well as Civil Rights of the Nation may be re&s;tor'd by her Hand.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28">To this end the Face of Affairs have re|ceiv'd &s;uch a Turn in the proce&s;s of a few Months, as never has been before; the leading Men of the Nation, the univer&s;al Cry of the People, the unanimous Reque&s;t of the Clergy, agree in this, that the Deliverance of our Church is at hand.</P>
<P>For this end has Providence given us &s;uch a Parliament, &s;uch a Convocation, &s;uch a Gentry, and &s;uch a Queen as we never had before.</P>
<P>AND what may be the Con&s;equences of a Neglect of &s;uch Opportunities? The Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown has but a dark Pro&s;pect, another <HI>Dutch</HI> Turn may make the Hopes of it ridicu|lous, and the Practice impo&s;&s;ible: Be the Hou&s;e of our future Princes never &s;o well inclin'd, they will be Foreigners; and many Years will be &s;pent in &s;uiting the Genius of Strangers to the Crown, and to the Intere&s;ts of the Nation; and how many Ages it may be before the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Throne be fill'd with &s;o much Zeal and Candour, &s;o much Tenderne&s;s, and hearty Af|fection to the Church, as we &s;ee it now cover'd with, who can imagine.</P>
<P>'Tis high time then for the Friends of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to think of Building up,
<PB N="27" REF="29">
and E&s;tabli&s;hing her, in &s;uch a manner, that &s;he may be no more Invaded by Foreigners, nor Divided by Factions, Schi&s;ms, and Error.</P>
<P>IF this cou'd be done by gentle and ea&s;y Methods, I &s;hou'd be glad, but the Wound is coroded, the Vitals begin to mortifie, and no|thing but Amputation of Members can compleat the Cure&punc; all the ways of Tenderne&s;s and Compa&s;|&s;ion, all per&s;wa&s;ive Arguments have been made u&s;e of in vain.</P>
<P>THE Humour of the Di&s;&s;enters has &s;o encreas'd among the People, that they hold the Church in Defiance, and the Hou&s;e of God is an Abomination among them: Nay, they have brought up their Po&s;terity in &s;uch pre-po&s;&s;e&s;t Aver&s;ions to our Holy Religion, that the ig|norant Mob think we are all Idolaters, and Wor&s;hippers of <HI>Baal</HI>; and account it a Sin to come within the Walls of our Churches.</P>
<P>The primitive Chri&s;tians were not more &s;hie of a Heathen-Temple, or of Meat offer'd to I|dols, nor the <HI>Jews</HI> of Swine's-Fle&s;h, than &s;ome of our Di&s;&s;enters are of the Church, and the Divine Service &s;olemnized therein.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="30">THIS Ob&s;tinacy mu&s;t be rooted out with the Profe&s;&s;ion of it, while the Generation are left at liberty daily to affront God Almighty, and Di&s;honour his Holy Wor&s;hip, we are want|ing in our Duty to God, and our Mother the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>How can we an&s;wer it to God, to the Church, and to our Po&s;terity, to leave them en|tangled with Fanatici&s;me, Error, and Ob&s;tinacy, in the Bowels of the Nation; to leave them an Enemy in their Streets, that in time may involve them in the &s;ame Crimes, and endanger the utter Extirpation of Religion in the Nation.</P>
<P>WHAT's the Difference betwixt this, and being &s;ubjected to the Power of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> from whence we have reform'd? If one be an extreme on one Hand, and one on ano|ther, 'tis equally de&s;tructive to the Truth, to have Errors &s;ettled among us, let them be of what Nature they will.</P>
<P>Both are Enemies of our Church, and of our Peace, and why &s;hou'd it not be as criminal to admit an Enthu&s;ia&s;t as a Je&s;uit? Why &s;hou'd the <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> with his Seven Sacraments be wor&s;e than the <HI>Quaker</HI> with no Sacraments at all?
<PB N="29" REF="31">
Why &s;hou'd Religious-hou&s;es be more intollerable than Meeting-hou&s;es&mdash; <HI>Alas the Church of England!</HI> What with Popery on one Hand, and Schi&s;maticks on the other; how has &s;he been Crucify'd between two Thieves.</P>
<P>Now <HI>let us Crucifie the Thieves.</HI> Let her Foundations be e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon the De&s;tructi|on of her Enemies: The Doors of Mercy be|ing always open to the returning Part of the deluded People: Let the Ob&s;tinate be rul'd with the Rod of Iron.</P>
<P>Let all true Sons of &s;o Holy an Oppre&s;&s;ed Mother, exa&s;perated by her Afflictions, harden their Hearts again&s;t tho&s;e who have oppre&s;s'd her.</P>
<P><HI>And may God Almighty put it into the Hearts of all the Friends of Truth, to lift up a Standard again&s;t Pride and Antichri&s;t, that the Po&s;terity of the Sons of Error may be rooted out from the Face of this Land for ever&mdash;.</HI></P>
