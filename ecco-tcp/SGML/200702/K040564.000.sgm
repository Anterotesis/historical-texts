<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c</HEAD>
<P>I GUESS Bu&s;ine&s;s has prevented your calling on me, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, as I know you do not want good Nature; be&s;ides, I am certain you had me in your Mind, having been in|formed you were kind enough to &s;peak in my behalf, when my Character was attacked by a <HI>low Fellow,</HI> who <HI>unworthi|ly</HI> bears the <HI>Name</HI> of a <HI>Comedian,</HI> becau&s;e during a Dearth of decent Performers, he is &s;uffered unnoticed to murder many a Part, to the Reproach of our pre&s;ent &s;te|rile Stage, while he mode&s;tly mi&s;con&s;trues the <HI>Forbearance</HI> of the <HI>Town</HI> into an <HI>Ap|probation:</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
This Slanderer, who&s;e Soul is darker than his du&s;ky Countenance, which often dingily degrades a genteel Comedy, by his di&s;graceful Appearance, has, as I am well informed, been very bu|&s;y in propagating &s;ome Fal&s;hoods to my Prejudice, at this mo&s;t unpardonable Juncture, when I can't come Abroad to give him an An&s;wer, if he were worthy one.</P>
<P>If his Mind had the lea&s;t Tincture of a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> (a Name which, indeed, neither his Birth, Education, or Morals give him the lea&s;t Preten&s;ions to) he would know, that now to utter even a &s;evere Truth, were an Act of Inhumanity; and that to indulge Spleen again&s;t the Unfortu|nate, is as ba&s;e as cowardly &s;triking the Pro&s;tate. What he may be plea&s;|ed to &s;ay of me as an Actor, is de|lightfully de&s;picable; I have too proper a Contempt for his Mock-Judgment, not to con&s;ider his Di&s;approbation as a Com|pliment; and mu&s;t imagine any one of True Ta&s;te would regard his Prai&s;e as the &s;evere&s;t Satire.</P>
<P>Were I di&s;po&s;ed to throw away my Time in Drawing this Notorious Man at full Length, and Paint him in his
<PB N="7" REF="6">
proper Colours (which I may po&s;&s;ibly be provoked to, if he does not learn to re&s;train his Fibbing Tongue) I could exhibit to View a Mon&s;ter, which every one but his &s;curvy &s;elf would &s;tart at: I &s;hould have held him quite beneath my Notice, as is all he utters, but that the Appetite of Slander, in many, is too pre|dominant; and, 'tis po&s;&s;ible, when the filthie&s;t Fellow throws a Profu&s;ion of Dirt, &s;ome may chance to &s;tick, if not timely thrown off; I &s;hall endeavour therefore, to wipe away the &s;ooty Smears of this Chimney-&s;weeper, by relating a &s;imple Fact, which will, I flatter my|&s;elf, amply confute the malicious Tales of this unprovoked, rancorous Mortal:&mdash;I &s;ay unprovoked, for I am not con&s;cious I was ever guilty of an Injury towards him in Thought, Word, or Deed; and as this Viperous Gnatho has ever, to my Face, affected to be my Friend, his Back|biting appears the more &s;urpri&s;ingly inju|rious and &s;hocking. Why this bad Man has thus endeavoured to blacken me I &s;hould not readily have been able to ac|count for, had not the entertaining <HI>In|&s;pector</HI> furni&s;hed me with the following Paragraph, in his E&s;&s;ay on Detraction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
<Q>One would imagine by the Spirit and eager Plea&s;ure with which Calum|nies are rai&s;ed and propagated, that Men &s;uppo&s;ed they obtained into their own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion all tho&s;e good Qualities, of the Credit of which they robbed another: With tho&s;e who are warm|e&s;t in the Practice, &s;omething like this is perhaps the Ca&s;e. Virtue they place in no E&s;teem farther than as an Article of Reputation; and in this they &s;ee it only as owing its Lu&s;tre to Compa|ri&s;on: They feel a thou&s;and Ob&s;tacles to rai&s;ing them&s;elves up to the Level of tho&s;e whom they envy; but they &s;ee the &s;ame End is to be an&s;wered by bringing them down to theirs: If they cannot add to the Merchandi&s;e in one Scale, they will &s;teal away the Weights from the other, and the Balance will this Way al&s;o appear equal.</Q></P>
<P>Let me add a Line or two more from that Writer, which &s;eem <HI>apropos.</HI></P>
<P><Q>He who is him&s;elf abandoned, and has not Virtue to in&s;pire a Re&s;olution of reclaiming, will &s;natch at every Op|portunity of Scandal in another, and
<PB N="9" REF="8">
he will urge it as a Proof, that all Mankind are like him, only that they are Hypocrites.</Q></P>
<P>While I am expre&s;&s;ing my <HI>Contempt</HI> and <HI>Dete&s;tation</HI> of this <HI>Detractor,</HI> let me confe&s;s my Obligation to Mr. MACK|LIN, who, I under&s;tand, was candid e|nough, in my Ab&s;ence, to contradict, on his own Knowledge, &s;ome of the Slan|der uttered again&s;t me; This he is the more prai&s;e-worthy for, and the Act more particularly merits my Regard as there was not any &s;trong Intimacy &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting between us:&mdash;Be &s;o good, to make my Compliments to him, and let him know, <HI>I have a grateful Sen&s;e of his Behaviour to me.</HI></P>
<P>There are other <HI>Chatterers</HI> in a Cof|fee-Hou&s;e, I am told, <HI>"who, like to Vil|lage-Curs, bark when their Fellows do,"</HI> The mo&s;t of the&s;e are the mere <HI>Fag|gots</HI> of a <HI>Theatre,</HI> who ju&s;t &s;erve to fill up the <HI>Mu&s;ter-Roll</HI> of a <HI>Company;</HI> NAMES that now and then <HI>clutter up</HI> a <HI>Play-Bill,</HI> with as little Significancy as ROE and DOE in a <HI>Writ,</HI> or JOHN A|NOKES and TOM A-STILES in a <HI>Law Ca&s;e:</HI> When you hear any of 'em
<PB N="10" REF="9">
mentioned, you no more annex the I|dea of an Actor to the Names of the former, than you do to the latter the I|dea of any one Breathing: Might not one cry out, with FALSTAEF, when they are &s;een or mentioned<HI>&mdash;I am a Rogue if I am not a&s;hamed of my Company!&mdash;</HI>The&s;e are a Kind of Parrots, who fancy they entertain, while their Prating is but the Pe&s;t of the Public Society; yet they will be heard, though they are more di&s;turbing to a rational Conver&s;ation, than the pert and noi&s;y Chirpings of caged Birds in a &s;mall Room, on a &s;un-&s;hiny Day.&mdash;Among the&s;e may be one or two, perhaps, who, by a lucky Hit in &s;ome farcical Extravaganza, with Buffoon|ery and Impudence, (which with the Million, too frequently pa&s;s for Humour and Spirit) &s;ans Judgment, or Genius, gain the Applau&s;e of a Day, and then deem them&s;elves Actors; much as &s;ome modern Metre-mongers, from the Suc|ce&s;s of a &s;light Sonnet (&s;ung with univer|&s;al Applau&s;e, for&s;ooth, at <HI>Sadlers-Wells)</HI> a&s;&s;ume the Character of Poets.</P>
<P>The&s;e choice Brethren of the Bu&s;kin and Sock (with which our pre&s;ent Thea|tres too much abound) are a &s;ort of
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Things, who have no Chance for being Con&s;picuous but by the Removal or Abu&s;e of Actors to whom the Encouragement and continued Approbation of the Town, may have given an e&s;tabli&s;hed Reputa|tion: their little malicious Envy is ea&s;ily accounted for, and their cobweb Arts pre|&s;ently &s;een through<HI>&mdash;Pour ces Petits Hommes du Jour je me mocque de ceux.</HI> But now to an&s;wer the two particular LIES this <HI>Bad Man</HI> has told of me, <HI>viz.</HI> That I ran away from <HI>Ireland</HI> in <HI>Debt,</HI> and left my <HI>Bail to pay a Debt</HI> for me in <HI>Liverpool.</HI></P>
<P>How I &s;ucceeded in <HI>Dublin,</HI> as an Ac|tor you may have heard, and a Gentle|man, a Well-wi&s;her of mine, having publi&s;hed an Account of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Theatre in a Letter from <HI>Dublin</HI> to a Friend in <HI>London,</HI> printed in the <HI>In&s;pector,</HI> or <HI>Lon|don Daily Adverti&s;er,</HI> la&s;t Summer, which I &s;end you inclo&s;ed; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the</HI> Appendix, p. 18.</NOTE> to that I refer you, as far as relates to Stage Affairs:&mdash;As to my Conduct off the Stage: I may affirm I lived reputably, and de|cently; and my Mind being more at Ea&s;e while I was there for three Years, than it had been for a long time before, I know of No Irregularities I gave way
<PB N="12" REF="11">
to there, that could either bring Shame to my&s;elf, or cau&s;e my Friends to blu&s;h for me.</P>
<P>I remained in <HI>Dublin</HI> a Fortnight af|ter the Theatre was clo&s;ed, and my Contract with the Manager was deter|mined: I always openly declared I in|tended for <HI>London</HI> in the Summer&mdash;But &s;ome private Bu&s;ine&s;s calling me hi|ther &s;ooner than I expected, I com|mi&s;&s;ion'd a Friend to pay any Debts I might accidentally have forgot; and immediately after my Sailing, an Adver|ti&s;ement was publi&s;hed, and continued to that Effect, for &s;everal Days, in ES|DAL's NEWS LETTER, of which I have &s;ome in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to produce, if requi&s;ite: And now, I think, I may fairly aver, there is No one Per&s;on there has any Demand upon me.</P>
<P>But now to return to <HI>Liverpool:&mdash;</HI>That I was, two Years &s;ince, arre&s;ted at <HI>Liverpool,</HI> is certain;&mdash;A Gen|tleman there pa&s;&s;ed his Word for my Appearance;&mdash;This he was the more inclineable to do, as He knew the o|riginal Plaintiff was not the Be&s;t of Men; and had Rea&s;on to believe the
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Debt was hone&s;tly di&s;putable:&mdash;I yielded my&s;elf to the Attorney the next Day:&mdash;The Gentleman knowing how much the Benefits (for I was then acting in a Company there) depended on my Performance (and a fa|voured friend of his having one come|ing on) continued his Security to the Attorney:&mdash;Some Time after, I came Po&s;t to <HI>London,</HI> in order to &s;et|tle a Bill in Chancery, which I was preparing to ju&s;tify my&s;elf. And the Opening of the Theatre in <HI>Dublin,</HI> to which I was engaged, was &s;o near at Hand, being pinched in Time, I was under a Nece&s;&s;ity of getting thither as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>In the Interim a <HI>Re&s;pon&s;ible Friend</HI> of <HI>mine</HI> gave the Gentleman at <HI>Liverpool</HI> a <HI>Satisfactory Counter Security.</HI></P>
<P>Had Things turned out ever &s;o Bad (as who can an&s;wer for Law Proceed|ings) the Gentleman at <HI>Liverpool</HI> could not &s;uffer: But the Plaintiff dying, the Affair was at an End&mdash;And nei|ther one, nor t'other of the Securities ever did, or can &s;u&s;tain any Damage.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
<HI>"Somewhat too much of this."</HI></P>
<P>And now I have only to add my Reque&s;t, that you would make my Com|pliments to all good natured Friends that enquire after me;&mdash;As the Way from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> hither is Now A|BRIDG'D, and the Road clean and plea|&s;ant, I am in Hopes (having given Se|curity for the Rules) to &s;ee &s;ome of 'em at my Habitation, in <HI>Falcon Court,</HI> where (oh &s;trange to tell!) I lodge op|po&s;ite to No le&s;s a Per&s;on than my Half Name - &s;ake THEO&mdash;, K&mdash;g of C&mdash;CA.</P>
<Q><L>Thus &s;port the Fates with all &s;ublunar Things,</L>
<L>And Pri&s;oners make of Players and of Kings.</L></Q>
<P>When the Term comes, <HI>(Diu mul|tumque De&s;iderat.)</HI> I may with the Con|venience of a Day - Rule, contrive to break from this <HI>Retirement</HI> (if properly called on) and, like the ROMAN CIN|CINNATUS from the <HI>Plough,</HI> once more enter on a Scene of PUBLIC ACTION.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Dublin,</HI> <DATE><HI>June</HI> 30, 1752,</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s that de|tains me here longer than I ex|expected; I &s;hall now give you an Epi&s;tolary Account of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Thea|tre, which I propo&s;ed to have re&s;erved as a Topic of Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="18">
Know then, I have &s;till continued a con&s;tant Play-Hunter, and have found my Time not mi&s;-employed; I ever thought Plays the mo&s;t rational, as well as the mo&s;t agreeable Amu&s;ement; and the Company of the Theatre Royal in <HI>Dub|lin,</HI> is well worthy of Encouragement: The numerous and polite Audiences they have had this Sea&s;on, &s;hew the whole Town are of my Mind. We have two Theatres here, but they are both rented by one Per&s;on. That in <HI>Aungier-&s;treet,</HI> has the large&s;t and loftie&s;t Stage; but not being &s;o conveniently &s;ituated for the Town in general, is rarely u&s;ed, unle&s;s for A&s;&s;emblies, a Dramatic Opera, or now and then a Play. That in <HI>Smock-Alley</HI> is chiefly for Plays. It is a compleat pretty Hou&s;e, not &s;o large as tho&s;e of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> con&s;equently the Decorations cannot be &s;o magnificent; but the Scenes are ve|ry decent, and the Habits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> extremely hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>The Performances are various, and re|gularly conducted (no Per&s;on whatever be|ing admitted behind the Scenes) Mr. SHERIDAN is the chief Director, and me|rits the Encouragement of the Public for
<PB N="20" REF="19">
his Abilities as an Actor; particularly in the Characters of HORATIO in the <HI>Fair Penitent,</HI> MACBETH, HAMLET, and CO|RIOLANUS. They perform near twice the Number of Plays here, to what they do in <HI>London;</HI> and act near as many Nights, tho' their Company is not near &s;o large in Number. Some Plays have been re|peated a dozen Times in the Sea&s;on to very crowded Audiences, particularly the <HI>Provoked Husband,</HI> the <HI>Trip to the Jubilee,</HI> and the <HI>Nonjuror;</HI> the <HI>Relap&s;e, Sir Fop|ling Flutter,</HI> the <HI>Carele&s;s Husband,</HI> the <HI>Double Dealer,</HI> the <HI>Di&s;tre&s;t Mother, King John, Jane Shore,</HI> the <HI>Mourning Bride,</HI> and <HI>Henry the 8th,</HI> have been often acted, which is greatly owing to the inimitable Performance of Mrs. WOFFINGTON, who charms all (but chiefly the Judicious) in the Characters of <HI>Lady Townly, Sir H. Wildair,</HI> and <HI>Maria;</HI> this la&s;t mention|ed Part is, I think, one of the highe&s;t drawn Characters in Comedy, and &s;he does the excellent Author Ju&s;tice; nor is the Succe&s;s of the <HI>Nonjuror</HI> a little owing to the ma&s;terly Performance of Mr. CIB|BER, who &s;upports the Character of Dr. <HI>Wolf</HI> throughout, with a drole Dignity, a prie&s;tly Pride, in&s;inuating Cunning, and affected Humility, as marks the Character
<PB N="21" REF="20">
with true Humour, Spirit, and Propriety; and &s;hews him a ju&s;t Comedian. The&s;e two Comedians in mo&s;t of their Parts ex|cel others; but in the&s;e they may be &s;aid to excel them&s;elves.&mdash;I always e&s;teemed him a good Actor, but had not &s;een him act &s;ince the Beginning of 1749, when he appeared not in &s;uch perfect Health as he &s;eems now to enjoy, with a happy Flow of Spirits. He has this la&s;t Winter given great Delight in the &s;everal Charac|ters of <HI>Lord Foppington, Sir Fopling Flutter, Sir Francis Wronghead, Beau Clincher, Po|lonius, Scrub, Sir Paul Pliant, Clodio, Don Manuel, Barnaby Brittle, Gomez, Abel Drug|ger, &amp;c.</HI> in all which he &s;hew'd a thorough Knowledge of Life, and an unconfined Genius; he pur&s;ues Nature, and plays them with admirable Variety.</P>
<P>Were I to expatiate on the various Me|rits of the three before-mentioned Perfor|mers, I &s;hould &s;end you a Pamphlet in|&s;tead of an Epi&s;tle, &s;o &s;hall only add, that the Contention here concerning WOF|FINGTON has been wherein &s;he &s;hone mo&s;t; whether in Tragedy or Comedy. She's great in both, but the latter gives her an Opportunity of &s;hewing the great|er Variety; and &s;he's &s;o much a Mi&s;tre&s;s of
<PB N="22" REF="21">
her Profe&s;&s;ion, 'tis &s;carce ea&s;y to determine what Ca&s;t of Parts mo&s;t properly belong to her; &s;ince I have beheld her with un|common Admiration, as a <HI>Jane Shore,</HI> an <HI>Hermione,</HI> and <HI>Andromache,</HI> a <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> a <HI>Lady Betty Modi&s;h,</HI> and a <HI>Lady Pliant,</HI> in the Space of a few Weeks. Mr. SHERI|DAN is excellent in <HI>Ma&s;kwell,</HI> and CIB|BER and WOFFINGTON are highly enter|taining in the drole Characters of <HI>Sir Paul</HI> and <HI>Lady Phant.</HI> Tho' my Paper is al|mo&s;t full, and your Patience, I doubt not, well nigh tired, I mu&s;t mention her ex|traordinary Performance in <HI>Phoedra.</HI> Her Attitudes were gracefully picture&s;que, ju&s;t|ly adapted to her various De&s;criptions and Pa&s;&s;ions; None &s;eem'd forced or &s;tudied: Her Countenance was equally expre&s;&s;ive, and &s;he &s;o well managed her Voice, &s;he neither wanted Power or Variety through the whole Part. Her <HI>Queen Catherine</HI> al|&s;o in <HI>Henry the 8th,</HI> and <HI>Volumnia</HI> in <HI>Co|riolanus</HI> were fine Performances. Nor can I decline giving Prai&s;e to CIBBER in the Character of <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI> which he performed at his &s;econd Benefit (the principal Actors here have two each, in one Sea&s;on) to a va&s;t Audience, with de&s;erved Applau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
To conclude: Of the three Performers I have here mention'd, I think, may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, (what a late celebrated Writer ob&s;erved of one of them) <Q>Judiciou&s;ly con&s;idered in their various Lights, they are but barely received as they de&s;erve, when the Audience appears mo&s;t fa|vourable to them.</Q></P>
