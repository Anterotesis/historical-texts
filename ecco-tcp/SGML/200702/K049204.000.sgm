<P>_THAT I decline the Honour of attending, with at lea&s;t one <HI>hone&s;t Addre&s;s,</HI> is from &s;ome Hazard there might be, of your mi&s;taking the true Motive of it. Free from all Ambition to make One, among the Wor&s;hippers of your <HI>Fortune,</HI> I pre&s;ent you, and at Di&s;tance too, a bare Confe&s;&s;ion of your <HI>Virtues.</HI></P>
<P>TO know the Writer of this Piece, can be of no Importance to your Lord&s;hip. He lies too low to merit a great Mini&s;ter's In|quiry. It will plea&s;e the Public better, that he knows YOU, rightly: and, that he does &s;o, he appeals to the Poem.</P>

HE is too well acquainted with the mo|dern Turn of Sentiment, in &s;ome, (who, for a few Years, mu&s;t be <HI>called)</HI> Great Men, to look for any pre&s;ent Con&s;equence, from <HI>Poetry;</HI> where even the Be&s;t finds more Contempt than due <HI>Di&s;cernment.</HI> But, at the &s;ame time he knows, that this is One, among the Faults of bad Admini&s;tration, which a Soul like Yours came qualified to think <HI>worth mending:</HI> And we might have had more Certainty, that you would do it, had you been as plea&s;ed with your own Pro|fit, as the Public's; &s;ince the cleare&s;t Inte|re&s;t is <HI>His,</HI> in every Honour done the <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> who is born for Actions, of a Pitch <HI>above the Spirit</HI> of cold Writers.</P>
<P>I HAVE nothing more to trouble you with, except the warm and ju&s;t good Wi&s;hes of</P>
