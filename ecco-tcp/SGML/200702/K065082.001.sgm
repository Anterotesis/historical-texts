<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not my intention to detain the reader by expatiating on the variety, or the import|ance of the &s;ubject, which I have undertaken to treat; &s;ince the merit of the choice would &s;erve to render the weakne&s;s of the execution &s;till more apparent, and &s;till le&s;s excu&s;able. But as I have pre&s;umed to lay before the Public a <HI>fir&s;t</HI> volume only <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t volume of the quarto, is now contained in the two fir&s;t volumes of this octavo, edition.</NOTE> of the Hi&s;tory of the De|cline and Fall of the Roman Empire, it will perhaps be expected that I &s;hould explain, in a few words, the nature and limits of my general plan.</P>
<P>The memorable &s;eries of revolutions, which, in the cour&s;e of about thirteen centuries, gra|dually undermined, and at length de&s;troyed, the &s;olid fabric of Roman greatne&s;s, may, with &s;ome propriety, be divided into the three fol|lowing periods.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="iv" REF="4">
1. The fir&s;t of the&s;e periods may be traced from the age of Trajan and the Antonines, when the Roman monarchy, having attained its full &s;trength and maturity, began to verge towards its decline; and will extend to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the We&s;tern Empire, by the barbarians of Germany and Scythia, the rude ance&s;tors of the mo&s;t poli&s;hed nations of mo|dern Europe. This extraordinary revolution, which &s;ubjected Rome to the power of a Gothic conqueror, was completed about the beginning of the &s;ixth century.</P>
<P N="2">II. The &s;econd period of the Decline and Fall of Rome, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to commence with the reign of Ju&s;tinian, who by his laws, as well as by his victories, re&s;tored a tran&s;ient &s;plendour to the Ea&s;tern Empire. It will comprehend the inva&s;ion of Italy by the Lombards; the conque&s;t of the A&s;iatic and African provinces by the Arabs, who embraced the religion of Mahomet; the revolt of the Roman people again&s;t the feeble princes of Con&s;tantinople; and the elevation of Char|lemagne, who, in the year eight hundred, e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;econd, or German Empire of the we&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">III. The la&s;t and longe&s;t of the&s;e periods includes about &s;ix centuries and a half; from
<PB N="v" REF="5" MS="y">
the revival of the We&s;tern Empire, till the taking of Con&s;tantinople by the Turks, and the extinction of a degenerate race of princes, who continued to a&s;&s;ume the titles of Cae&s;ar and Augu&s;tus, after their dominions were contracted to the limits of a &s;ingle city; in which the language, as well as manners, of the ancient Romans, had been long &s;ince for|gotten. The writer who &s;hould undertake to relate the events of this period, would find him&s;elf obliged to enter into the general hi&s;tory of the Cru&s;ades, as far as they con|tributed to the ruin of the Greek Empire; and he would &s;carcely be able to re&s;train his curio&s;ity from making &s;ome inquiry into the &s;tate of the city of Rome, during the darkne&s;s and confu&s;ion of the middle ages.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="postscript">
<P>As I have ventured, perhaps too ha&s;tily, to commit to the pre&s;s, a work, which, in every &s;en&s;e of the word, de&s;erves the epithet of im|perfect, I con&s;ider my&s;elf as contracting an engagement to fini&s;h, mo&s;t probably in a &s;e|cond volume <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The Author, as it frequently happens, took an inade|quate mea&s;ure of his growing work. The remainder of the fir&s;t period has filled <HI>two</HI> volumes in quarto, the <HI>four</HI> la&s;t volumes of this octavo edition.</NOTE>, the fir&s;t of the&s;e memorable periods; and to deliver to the Public, the complete hi&s;tory of the Decline and Fall of
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
Rome, from the age of the Antonines, to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the We&s;tern Empire. With regard to the &s;ub&s;equent periods, though I may entertain &s;ome hopes, I dare not pre&s;ume to give any a&s;&s;urances. The execution of the exten&s;ive plan which I have de&s;cribed, would connect the ancient and modern hi&s;tory of the World; but it would require many years of health, of lei&s;ure, and of per&s;everance.</P>

<P><HI>P. S.</HI> The entire Hi&s;tory, which is now publi&s;hed, of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire in the We&s;t, abundantly di&s;|charges my engagements with the Public. Perhaps their favourable opinion may encou|rage me to pro&s;ecute a work, which, how|ever laborious it may &s;eem, is the mo&s;t agree|able occupation of my lei&s;ure hours.</P>

<P>An Author ea&s;ily per&s;uades him&s;elf that the public opinion is &s;till favourable to his labours;
<PB N="vii" REF="7" MS="y">
and I have now embraced the &s;erious re&s;olu|tion of proceeding to the la&s;t period of my original de&s;ign, and of the Roman Empire, the taking of Con&s;tantinople by the Turks, in the year one thou&s;and four hundred and fifty-three. The mo&s;t patient Reader, who computes that three ponderous volumes <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The &s;ix volumes of this octavo edition.</NOTE> have been already employed on the events of four centuries, may, perhaps, be alarmed at the long pro&s;pect of nine hundred years. But it is not my intention to expatiate with the &s;ame minutene&s;s on the whole &s;eries of the Byzan|tine hi&s;tory. At our entrance into this period, the reign of Ju&s;tinian, and the conque&s;ts of the Mahometans, will de&s;erve and detain our attention, and the la&s;t age of Con&s;tantinople (the Cru&s;ades and the Turks) is connected with the revolutions of Modern Europe. From the &s;eventh to the eleventh century, the ob|&s;cure interval will be &s;upplied by a conci&s;e narrative of &s;uch facts, as may &s;till appear either intere&s;ting or important.</P>

The Hi&s;tory of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is now delivered to the Pub|lic in a more convenient form. Some altera|tions and improvements had pre&s;ented them|&s;elves to my mind, but I was unwilling to injure or offend the purcha&s;ers of the preced|ing editions. The accuracy of the Corrector of the pre&s;s has been already tried and ap|proved: and, perhaps, I may &s;tand excu&s;ed, if, amid&s;t the avocations of a bu&s;y winter, I have preferred the plea&s;ures of compo&s;ition and &s;tudy, to the minute diligence of revi&s;ing a former publication.</P>

<P>DILIGENCE and accuracy are the only merits which an hi&s;torical writer may a&s;cribe to him&s;elf; if any merit indeed can be a&s;&s;umed from the performance of an indi&s;pen&s;able duty. I may therefore be allowed to &s;ay, that I have carefully examined all the original materials that could illu&s;trate the &s;ubject which I had un|dertaken to treat. Should I ever complete the exten&s;ive de&s;ign which has been &s;ketched out in the Preface, I might perhaps conclude it with a critical account of the authors con&s;ulted during the progre&s;s of the whole work; and however &s;uch an attempt might incur the cen&s;ure of o&s;ten|tation, I am per&s;uaded, that it would be &s;u&s;cep|tible of entertainment as well as information.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent I &s;hall content my&s;elf with a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation. The Biographers, who, under the reigns of Diocletian and Con&s;tantine, compo&s;ed, or rather compiled, the lives of the Emperors, from Hadrian to the &s;ons of Carus, are u&s;ually mentioned under the names of Aelius Spartianus, Julius Capitolinus, Aelius Lampridius, Vulcatius Gallicanus, Trebellius Pollio, and Flavius Vopi&s;|cus. But there is &s;o much perplexity in the titles
<PB N="x" REF="10">
of the MSS.; and &s;o many di&s;putes have ari&s;en among the critics (&s;ee Fabricius, Biblioth. La|tin. l. iii. c. 6.) concerning their number, their names, and their re&s;pective property, that for the mo&s;t part I have quoted them without di&s;tinction, under the general and well-known title of the <HI>Augu&s;tan Hi&s;tory.</HI></P>

<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. 1. <HI>The Extent and Military Force of the Empire in the Age of the Antonines.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the &s;econd century of the Chri&s;tian Aera, the empire of Rome comprehended the fair|e&s;t part of the earth, and the mo&s;t civilized <NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduc|tion.</NOTE> portion of mankind. The frontiers of that ex|ten&s;ive monarchy were guarded by ancient re|nown and di&s;ciplined valour. The gentle, but powerful influence of laws and manners had gra|dually cemented the union of the provinces. Their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed and abu&s;ed the advantages of wealth and luxury. The image of a free con&s;titution was pre&s;erved with decent reverence: The Roman &s;enate appeared to po&s;|&s;e&s;s the &s;overeign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of govern|ment. During a happy period of more than <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 98,&mdash;180.</NOTE>
<PB N="2" REF="26">
four&s;core years, the public admini&s;tration was conducted by the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines. It is the de&s;ign of this, and of the two &s;ucceeding chapters, to de&s;cribe the pro&s;perous condition of their empire; and afterwards, from the death of Marcus Antoninus, to deduce the mo&s;t im|portant circum&s;tances of its decline and fall; a revolution which will ever be remembered, and is &s;till felt by the nations of the earth.</P>
<P>The principal conque&s;ts of the Romans were <NOTE PLACE="marg">Modera|tion of Augu&s;tus.</NOTE> atchieved under the republic; and the empe|rors, for the mo&s;t part, were &s;atisfied with pre|&s;erving tho&s;e dominions which had been acquir|ed by the policy of the &s;enate, the active emula|tion of the con&s;uls, and the martial enthu&s;ia&s;m of the people. The &s;even fir&s;t centuries were filled with a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of triumphs; but it was re&s;erved for Augu&s;tus, to relinqui&s;h the ambi|tious de&s;ign of &s;ubduing the whole earth, and to introduce a &s;pirit of moderation into the pub|lic councils. Inclined to peace by his temper and &s;ituation, it was ea&s;y for him to di&s;cover, that Rome, in her pre&s;ent exalted &s;ituation, had much l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s to hope than to fear from the chance of arms; and that, in the pro&s;ecution of remote wars, the undertaking became every day more difficult, the event more doubtful, and the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion more precarious, and le&s;s beneficial. The experience of Augu&s;tus added weight to the&s;e &s;a|lutary reflections, and effectually convinced him, that, by the prudent vigour of his coun&s;els, it
<PB N="3" REF="27">
would be ea&s;y to &s;ecure every conce&s;&s;ion, which the &s;afety or the dignity of Rome might require from the mo&s;t formidable Barbarians. In&s;tead of expo&s;ing his per&s;on and his legions to the ar|rows of the Parthians, he obtained, by an ho|nourable treaty, the re&s;titution of the &s;tandards and pri&s;oners which had been taken in the defeat of Cra&s;&s;us <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Dion Ca&s;&s;ius (l. liv. p. 736.), with the annotations of Reymar, who has collected all that Roman vanity has left upon the &s;ubject. The marble of Ancyra, on which Augu&s;tus recorded his own ex|ploits, a&s;&s;erts that <HI>he compelled</HI> the Parthians to re&s;tore the en&s;igns of Cra&s;&s;us.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His generals, in the early part of his reign, attempted the reduction of Aethiopia and Ara|bia Felix. They marched near a thou&s;and miles to the &s;outh of the tropic; but the heat of the climate &s;oon repelled the invaders, and protected the unwarlike natives of tho&s;e &s;eque&s;tered regi|ons <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Strabo (l. xvi. p. 780.), Pliny the elder (Hi&s;t. Natur. l. vi. c. 32. 35.), and Dion. Ca&s;&s;ius (l. liii. p. 723. and l. liv. p. 734.), have left us very curious details concerning the&s;e wars. The Ro|mans made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Mariaba, or Merab, a city of Ara|bia Felix, well known to the Orientals (&s;ee Abulfeda and the Nu|bian geography, p. 52.). They were arrived within three days jour|ney of the Spice country, the rich object of their inva&s;ion.</NOTE>. The northern countries of Europe &s;carcely de&s;erved the expence and labour of conque&s;t. The fore&s;ts and mora&s;&s;es of Germany were filled with a hardy race of barbarians, who de&s;pi&s;ed life when it was &s;eparated from freedom; and though, on the fir&s;t attack, they &s;eemed to yield to the weight of the Roman power, they &s;oon, by a &s;ig|nal act of de&s;pair, regained their independence, and reminded Augu&s;tus of the vici&s;&s;itude of for|tune <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">By the &s;laughter of Varus and his three legions. See the fir&s;t book of the Annals of Tacitus. Sueton. in Augu&s;t. c. 23. and Velleius Paterculus, l. ii. c. 117, &amp;c. Augu&s;tus did not receive the melancholy news with all the temper and firmne&s;s that might have been expected from his character.</NOTE>.
<PB N="4" REF="28">
On the death of that emperor, his te&s;ta|ment was publicly read in the &s;enate. He be|queathed, as a valuable legacy to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the advice of confining the empire within tho&s;e limits, which Nature &s;eemed to have placed as its permanent bulwarks and boundaries; on the we&s;t the Atlantic ocean; the Rhine and Danube on the north; the Euphrates on the ea&s;t; and towards the &s;outh, the &s;andy de&s;arts of Arabia and Africa <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Annal. l. ii. Dion Ca&s;&s;ius, l. lvi. p. 833. and the &s;peech of Augu&s;tus him&s;elf, in Julian's Cae&s;ars. It receives great light from the learned notes of his French tran&s;lator, M. Spanheim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Happily for the repo&s;e of mankind, the mo|derate <NOTE PLACE="marg">Imitated by his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors.</NOTE> &s;y&s;tem recommended by the wi&s;dom of Augu&s;tus, was adopted by the fears and vices of his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Engaged in the pur|&s;uit of plea&s;ure, or in the exerci&s;e of tyranny, the fir&s;t Cae&s;ars &s;eldom &s;hewed them&s;elves to the armies, or to the provinces; nor were they di&s;|po&s;ed to &s;uffer, that tho&s;e triumphs which <HI>their</HI> indolence neglected, &s;hould be u&s;urped by the conduct and valour of their lieutenants. The military fame of a &s;ubject was con&s;idered as an in&s;olent inva&s;ion of the Imperial prerogative; and it became the duty, as well as intere&s;t, of every Roman general, to guard the frontiers intru&s;ted to his care, without a&s;piring to conque&s;ts which
<PB N="5" REF="29">
might have proved no le&s;s fatal to him&s;elf than to the vanqui&s;hed barbarians <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Germanicus, Suetonius Paulinus, and Agricola, were checked and recalled in the cour&s;e of their victories. Corbulo was put to death. Military merit, as it is admirably expre&s;&s;ed by Tacitus, was, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, <HI>imperatoria virtus.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The only acce&s;&s;ion which the Roman empire <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conque&s;t of Britain was the fir&s;t excep|tion to it.</NOTE> received, during the fir&s;t century of the Chri&s;tian Aera, was the province of Britain. In this &s;in|gle in&s;tance the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Cae&s;ar and Augu&s;tus were per&s;uaded to follow the example of the for|mer, rather than the precept of the latter.

If, in the con&s;ideration of their ar|mies, we pa&s;s from their di&s;cipline to their num|bers, we &s;hall not find it ea&s;y to define them with any tolerable accuracy.

In&s;tead of being confined within the walls of fortified cities, which the Romans con&s;idered as the refuge of weakne&s;s or pu&s;illani|mity, the legions were encamped on the banks of the great rivers, and along the frontiers of the barbarians. As their &s;tations, for the mo&s;t part, remained fixed and permanent, we may venture to de&s;cribe the di&s;tribution of the troops. Three legions were &s;ufficient for Britain. The principal &s;trength lay upon the Rhine and Danube, and con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ixteen legions, in the following pro|portions: two in the Lower, and three in the Upper Germany; one in Rhaetia, one in Nori|cum, four in Pannonia, three in Mae&s;ia, and two in Dacia. The defence of the Euphrates was

entru&s;ted to eight legions, &s;ix of whom were planted in Syria, and the other two in Cappa|docia.

When Augu&s;tus gave laws to the conque&s;ts of his father, he introduced a divi&s;ion of Gaul equally adapted to the progre&s;s of the legions, to the cour&s;e of the rivers, and to the principal national di&s;tinctions, which had comprehended above an hundred independent &s;tates <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">One hundred and fifteen <HI>cities</HI> appear in the Notitia of Gaul; and it is well known that this appellation was applied not only to the capital town, but to the whole territory of each &s;tate.

Before Britain lo&s;t her freedom, the country was irregularly divided between thirty tribes of barbarians, of whom the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able were the Belgae in the We&s;t, the Brigantes in the North, the Silures in South Wales, and the Iceni in Norfolk and Suffolk <NOTE N="73" PLACE="foot">Whitaker's Hi&s;tory of Manche&s;ter, vol. i. c. 3.</NOTE>.

Notwith&s;tanding the change of ma&s;ters and of religion, the new city of Rome, founded by Con&s;tantine on the banks of the Bo&s;phorus, has ever &s;ince remained the capital of a great mo|narchy. The kingdom of Macedonia, which,

under the reign of Alexander, gave laws to A&s;ia, derived more &s;olid advantages from the policy of the two Philips; and with its dependencies of Epirus and The&s;&s;aly, extended from the Aegean to the Ionian &s;ea. When we reflect on the fame of Thebes and Argos, of Sparta and Athens, we can &s;carcely per&s;uade our&s;elves, that &s;o many immortal republics of antient Greece were lo&s;t in a &s;ingle province of the Roman empire, which, from the &s;uperior influence of the Achaean league, was u&s;ually denominated the province of Achaia.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of Europe under the Roman <NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;ia Mi|nor.</NOTE> emperors. The provinces of A&s;ia, without ex|cepting the tran&s;ient conque&s;ts of Trajan, are all comprehended within the limits of the Turki&s;h power. But, in&s;tead of following the arbitrary divi&s;ions of de&s;poti&s;m and ignorance, it will be &s;afer for us, as well as more agreeable, to ob&s;erve the indelible characters of nature. The name of A&s;ia Minor is attributed with &s;ome propriety to the penin&s;ula, which, confined between the Eux|ine and the Mediterranean, advances from the Euphrates towards Europe. The mo&s;t exten&s;ive and flouri&s;hing di&s;trict, we&s;tward of mount Tau|rus and the river Halys, was dignified by the Romans with the exclu&s;ive title of A&s;ia. The juri&s;diction of that province extended over the ancient monarchies of Troy, Lydia, and Phrygia, the maritime countries of the Pamphylians, Ly|cians, and Carians, and the Grecian colonies of Ionia, which equalled in arts, though not in arms, the glory of their parent. The kingdoms of Bithynia and Pontus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the northern &s;ide
<PB N="39" REF="63">
of the penin&s;ula from Con&s;tantinople to Trebi|zond. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, the province of Cilicia was terminated by the mountains of Syria: the inland country, &s;eparated from the Roman A&s;ia by the river Halys, and from Armenia by the Euphrates, had once formed the independent kingdom of Cappadocia. In this place we may ob&s;erve, that the northern &s;hores of the Euxine, beyond Trebizond in A&s;ia, and beyond the Da|nube in Europe, acknowledged the &s;overeignty of the emperors, and received at their hands, either tributary princes or Roman garri&s;ons. Budzak, Crim Tartary, Circa&s;&s;ia, and Mingrelia, are the modern appellations of tho&s;e &s;avage coun|tries <NOTE N="82" PLACE="foot">See the Periplus of Arrian.

<P>The family of Herod, at lea&s;t after it had been <NOTE PLACE="marg">Example of Herodes Atticus.</NOTE> favoured by fortune, was lineally de&s;cended from Cimon and Miltiades, The&s;eus and Cecrops, Aeacus and Jupiter. But the po&s;terity of &s;o many gods and heroes was fallen into the mo&s;t abject &s;tate. His grandfather had &s;uffered by the hands of ju&s;tice, and Julius Atticus, his father, mu&s;t have ended his life in poverty and contempt, had he not di&s;covered an immen&s;e trea&s;ure buried under an old hou&s;e, the la&s;t remains of his pa|trimony. According to the rigour of law, the emperor might have a&s;&s;erted his claim, and the

prudent Atticus prevented, by a frank confe&s;&s;ion, the officiou&s;ne&s;s of informers. But the equitable Nerva, who then filled the throne, refu&s;ed to accept any part of it, and commanded him to u&s;e, without &s;cruple, the pre&s;ent of fortune. The cautious Athenian &s;till in&s;i&s;ted, that the trea&s;ure was too con&s;iderable for a &s;ubject, and that he knew not how to <HI>u&s;e it.

But in the execution of the work the charge amounted to more than double the e&s;timate, and the officers of the revenue began to murmur, till the generous Atticus &s;ilenced their complaints, by reque&s;ting that he might be per|mitted to take upon him&s;elf the whole additional expence <NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot">Philo&s;trat. in Vit.

Agriculture is the foundation of manufactures; &s;ince the productions of nature are the materials of art. Under the Roman empire, the labour of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Arts of luxury.</NOTE> an indu&s;trious and ingenious people was variou&s;ly, but ince&s;&s;antly employed, in the &s;ervice of the rich. In their dre&s;s, their table, their hou&s;es, and their furniture, the favourites of fortune united every refinement of convenience, of ele|gance, and of &s;plendour; whatever could &s;ooth their pride, or gratify their &s;en&s;uality. Such refinements, under the odious name of luxury, have been &s;everely arraigned by the morali&s;ts of every age; and it might perhaps be more con|ducive to the virtue, as well as happine&s;s, of mankind, if all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the nece&s;&s;aries, and none the &s;uperfluities, of life. But in the pre&s;ent im|perfect condition of &s;ociety, luxury, though it may proceed from vice or folly, &s;eems to be the only means that can correct the unequal di&s;tribution of property. The diligent mechanic, and the &s;kilful arti&s;t, who have obtained no &s;hare in the divi&s;ion of the earth, receive a voluntary tax from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of land; and the latter are prompt|ed, by a &s;en&s;e of intere&s;t, to improve tho&s;e e&s;tates, with who&s;e produce they may purcha&s;e additional plea&s;ures. This operation, the par|ticular effects of which are felt in every &s;ociety, acted with much more diffu&s;ive energy in the Roman world. The provinces would &s;oon have been exhau&s;ted of their wealth, if the manufac|tures and commerce of luxury had not in&s;en&s;ibly re&s;tored to the indu&s;trious &s;ubjects, the &s;ums which
<PB N="88" REF="112">
were exacted from them by the arms and autho|rity of Rome. As long as the circulation was confined within the bounds of the empire, it im|pre&s;&s;ed the political machine with a new degree of activity, and its con&s;equences, &s;ometimes be|neficial, could never become pernicious.</P>
<P>But it is no ea&s;y ta&s;k to confine luxury within <NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign trade.</NOTE> the limits of an empire. The mo&s;t remote countries of the ancient world were ran&s;acked to &s;upply the pomp and delicacy of Rome. The fore&s;t of Scythia afforded &s;ome valuable furs. Amber was brought over land from the &s;hores of the Baltic to the Danube; and the barbarians were a&s;toni&s;hed at the price which they received in exchange for &s;o u&s;ele&s;s a commodity <NOTE N="101" PLACE="foot">Tacit.

Every year, about the time of the &s;um|mer &s;ol&s;tice, a fleet of an hundred and twenty ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed from Myos-hormos, a port of Egypt, on the Red Sea.

The labour and ri&s;k of the voyage was rewarded with almo&s;t incredible profit; but the profit was made upon Roman &s;ubjects, and a few indivi|duals were enriched at the expence of the Pub|lic. As the natives of Arabia and India were <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gold and &s;ilver.</NOTE> contented with the productions and manufactures of their own country, &s;ilver, on the &s;ide of the Romans, was the principal, if not the only in|&s;trument of commerce.

<P>The love of letters, almo&s;t in&s;eparable from <NOTE PLACE="marg">of genius.</NOTE> peace and refinement, was fa&s;hionable among the &s;ubjects of Hadrian and the Antonines, who were them&s;elves men of learning and curio&s;ity.

The authority of Plato and Ari&s;totle, of Zerno and Epicurus, &s;till reigned in the &s;chools; and their &s;y&s;tems, tran&s;mitted with blind deference from one gene|ration of di&s;ciples to another, precluded every generous attempt to exerci&s;e the powers, or en|large the limits, of the human mind.

But the pro|vincials of Rome, trained by a uniform artificial foreign education, were engaged in a very un|equal competition with tho&s;e bold ancients, who, by expre&s;&s;ing their genuine feelings in their na|tive tongue, had already occupied every place of honour. The name of Poet was almo&s;t forgot|ten; that of Orator was u&s;urped by the &s;ophi&s;ts.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Of the Con&s;titution of the Roman Empire, in the Age of the Antonines.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE obvious definition of a monarchy &s;eems to be that of a &s;tate, in which a &s;ingle per|&s;on, by what&s;oever name he may be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Idea of a monarchy.</NOTE> is intru&s;ted with the execution of the laws, the management of the revenue, and the command of the army. But, unle&s;s public liberty is protected by intrepid and vigilant guardians, the authority of &s;o formidable a magi&s;trate will &s;oon degenerate into de&s;poti&s;m. The influence of the clergy, in an age of &s;uper&s;tition, might be u&s;efully employ|ed to a&s;&s;ert the rights of mankind; but &s;o inti|mate is the connexion between the throne and the altar, that the banner of the church has very &s;eldom been &s;een on the &s;ide of the people. A martial nobility and &s;tubborn commons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of arms, tenacious of property, and collected into con&s;titutional a&s;&s;emblies, form the only balance capable of pre&s;erving a free con&s;titution again&s;t enterpri&s;es of an a&s;piring prince.</P>
<P>Every barrier of the Roman con&s;titution had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation of Augu&s;|tus.</NOTE> been levelled by the va&s;t ambition of the dic|tator; every fence had been extirpated by the cruel hand of the Triumvir. After the victory of Actium, the fate of the Roman world de|pended on the will of Octavianus, &s;urnamed Cae|&s;ar, by his uncle's adoption, and afterwards Au|gu&s;tus,
<PB N="96" REF="120">
by the flattery of the &s;enate. The con|queror was at the head of forty-four veteran le|gions <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Oro&s;ius, vi. 18.</NOTE>, con&s;cious of their own &s;trength, and of the weakne&s;s of the con&s;titution, habituated, during twenty years civil war, to every act of blood and violence, and pa&s;&s;ionately devoted to the hou&s;e of Cae&s;ar, from whence alone they had received, and expected, the mo&s;t lavi&s;h rewards. The provinces, long oppre&s;&s;ed by the mini&s;ters of the republic, &s;ighed for the government of a &s;ingle per&s;on, who would be the ma&s;ter, not the accomplice, of tho&s;e petty tyrants. The people of Rome, viewing, with a &s;ecret plea&s;ure, the humiliation of the ari&s;tocracy, demanded only bread and public &s;hows; and were &s;upplied with both by the liberal hand of Augu&s;tus. The rich and polite Italians, who had almo&s;t univer&s;ally embraced the philo&s;ophy of Epicurus, enjoyed the pre&s;ent ble&s;&s;ings of ea&s;e and tranquillity, and &s;uffered not the plea&s;ing dream to be interrupted by the memory of their old tumultuous freedom. With its power, the &s;enate had lo&s;t its dignity; many of the mo&s;t noble families were extinct. The republicans of &s;pirit and ability had peri&s;h|ed in the field of battle, or in the pro&s;cription. The door of the a&s;&s;embly had been de&s;ignedly left open, for a mixed multitude of more than a thou&s;and per&s;ons, who reflected di&s;grace upon their rank, in&s;tead of deriving honour from it <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Julius Cae&s;ar introduced &s;oldiers, &s;trangers, and half-barbarians, into the &s;enate (Sueton. in Cae&s;ar. c. 77, 80.).

The reformation of the &s;enate, was one of the fir&s;t &s;teps in which Augu&s;tus laid a&s;ide the ty|rant, and profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf the father of his <NOTE PLACE="marg">He re|forms the &s;enate.</NOTE> country. He was elected cen&s;or; and, in con|cert with his faithful Agrippa, he examined the li&s;t of the &s;enators, expelled a few members, who&s;e vices or who&s;e ob&s;tinacy required a pub|lic example, per&s;uaded near two hundred to pre|vent the &s;hame of an expul&s;ion by a voluntary retreat, rai&s;ed the qualification of a &s;enator to about ten thou&s;and pounds, created a &s;ufficient number of Patrician families, and accepted for him&s;elf, the honourable title of Prince of the Senate, which had always been be&s;towed, by the cen&s;ors, on the citizen the mo&s;t eminent for his honours and &s;ervices <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Dion Ca&s;&s;ius, l. iii. p. 693.

The memory of this comedy, repeated &s;everal times during the life of Augu&s;tus, was pre&s;erved to the la&s;t ages of the empire, by the peculiar pomp with which the perpetual monarchs of Rome always &s;olemnized the tenth years of their reign <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Dion, l. liii. p. 703, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Without any violation of the principles of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Power of the Roman generals:</NOTE> con&s;titution, the general of the Roman armies might receive and exerci&s;e an authority almo&s;t de&s;potic over the &s;oldiers, the enemies, and the &s;ubjects of the republic. With regard to the &s;oldiers, the jealou&s;y of freedom had, even from the earlie&s;t ages of Rome, given way to the hopes of conque&s;t, and a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of military di&s;cipline. The dictator, or con&s;ul, had a right to command the &s;ervice of the Roman youth; and to puni&s;h an ob&s;tinate or cowardly di&s;obe|dience by the mo&s;t &s;evere and ignominious pe|nalties,

The choice of the enemies of Rome was regularly decided by the legi&s;lative authority. The mo&s;t important re&s;olutions of peace and war were &s;eriou&s;ly debated in the &s;enate, and &s;olemnly ratified by the people. But when the arms of the legions were carried to a great di&s;tance from Italy, the generals a&s;&s;umed the liberty of direct|ing them again&s;t whatever people, and in what|ever manner, they judged mo&s;t advantageous for the public &s;ervice. It was from the &s;ucce&s;s, not from the ju&s;tice, of their enterpri&s;es, that they expected the honours of a triumph. In the u&s;e of victory, e&s;pecially after they were no longer controlled by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the &s;enate, they exerci&s;ed the mo&s;t unbounded de&s;poti&s;m. When Pompey commanded in the ea&s;t, he re|warded his &s;oldiers and allies, dethroned princes,

The ra|tification of his acts met with &s;ome oppo&s;ition and delays in the &s;enate. See Plutarch, Appian, Dion Ca&s;&s;ius, and the fir&s;t book of the epi&s;tles to Atticus.</NOTE>. Such was the power over the &s;oldiers, and over the enemies of Rome, which was either granted to, or a&s;&s;umed by, the generals of the republic. They were, at the &s;ame time, the governors, or rather monarchs, of the conquered provinces, united the civil with the military character, admini&s;tered ju&s;tice as well as the finances, and exerci&s;ed both the executive and legi&s;lative power of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>From what has been already ob&s;erved in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lieute|nants of the empe|ror.</NOTE> fir&s;t chapter of this work, &s;ome notion may be formed of the armies and provinces thus intru&s;t|ed to the ruling hand of Augu&s;tus. But as it was impo&s;&s;ible that he could per&s;onally command the legions of &s;o many di&s;tant frontiers, he was indulged by the &s;enate, as Pompey had already been, in the permi&s;&s;ion of devolving the execu|tion of his great office on a &s;ufficient number of lieutenants. In rank and authority the&s;e officers &s;eemed not inferior to the ancient procon&s;uls; but their &s;tation was dependent and precarious. They received and held their commi&s;&s;ions at

the will of a &s;uperior, to who&s;e <HI>au&s;picious</HI> influ|ence the merit of their action was legally attri|buted <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Under the commonwealth, a triumph could only be claimed by the general, who was authori&s;ed to take the Au&s;pices in the name of the people. By an exact con&s;equence drawn from this principle of policy and religion, the triumph was re&s;erved to the emperor; and his mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful lieutenants were &s;atisfied with &s;ome marks of di&s;tinction, which, under the name of triumphal honours, were invented in their favour.</NOTE>. They were the repre&s;entatives of the emperor. The emperor alone was the general of the republic, and his juri&s;diction, civil as well as military, extended over all the conque&s;ts of Rome. It was &s;ome &s;atisfaction, however, to the &s;enate, that he always delegated his power to the members of their body. The Imperial lieute|nants were of con&s;ular or praetorian dignity; the legions were commanded by &s;enators, and the praefecture of Egypt was the only important tru&s;t committed to a Roman knight.</P>
<P>Within &s;ix days after Augu&s;tus had been com|pelled <NOTE PLACE="marg">Divi&s;ion of the pro|vinces be|tween the emperor and the &s;e|nate.</NOTE> to accept &s;o very liberal a grant, he re|&s;olved to gratify the pride of the &s;enate by an ea&s;y &s;acrifice. He repre&s;ented to them, that they had enlarged his powers, even beyond that degree which might be required by the melancholy con|dition of the times. They had not permitted him to refu&s;e the laborious command of the ar|mies and the frontiers; but he mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on being allowed to re&s;tore the more peaceful and &s;ecure provinces, to the mild admini&s;tration of the civil magi&s;trate. In the divi&s;ion of the pro|vinces, Augu&s;tus provided for his own power,
<PB N="103" REF="127">
and for the dignity of the republic. The pro|con&s;uls of the &s;enate, particularly tho&s;e of A&s;ia, Greece, and Africa, enjoyed a more honourable character than the lieutenants of the emperor, who commanded in Gaul or Syria. The former were attended by lictors, the latter by &s;oldiers. A law was pa&s;&s;ed, that wherever the emperor was pre&s;ent, his extraordinary commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould &s;uper&s;ede the ordinary juri&s;diction of the go|vernor; a cu&s;tom was introduced, that the new conque&s;ts belonged to the Imperial portion; and it was &s;oon di&s;covered, that the authority of the <HI>Prince,</HI> the favourite epithet of Augu&s;tus, was the &s;ame in every part of the empire.</P>
<P>In return for this imaginary conce&s;&s;ion, Au|gu&s;tus <NOTE PLACE="marg">The for|mer pre|&s;erves his military command, and guards in Rome it&s;elf.</NOTE> obtained an important privilege, which rendered him ma&s;ter of Rome and Italy. By a dangerous exception to the ancient maxims, he was authorized to pre&s;erve his military command, &s;upported by a numerous body of guards, even in time of peace, and in the heart of the capital. His command, indeed, was confined to tho&s;e citizens who were engaged in the &s;ervice by the military oath; but &s;uch was the propen&s;ity of the Romans to &s;ervitude, that the oath was volun|tarily taken by the magi&s;trates, the &s;enators, and the eque&s;trian order, till the homage of flattery was in&s;en&s;ibly converted into an annual and &s;o|lemn prote&s;tation of fidelity.</P>
<P>Although Augu&s;tus con&s;idered a military force <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;ular and tribu|nitian powers.</NOTE> as the firme&s;t foundation, he wi&s;ely rejected it, as a very odious in&s;trument of government. It was more agreeable to his temper, as well as to his

policy, to reign under the venerable names of ancient magi&s;tracy, and artfully to collect, in his own per&s;on, all the &s;cattered rays of civil juri&s;|diction. With this view, he permitted the &s;enate to confer upon him, for his life, the powers of the con&s;ular <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">Cicero (de Legibus, iii. 3.) gives the con&s;ular office the name of <HI>Regia pote&s;tas:</HI> and Polybius (l. vi. c. 3.) ob&s;erves three powers in the Roman con&s;titution.

See his own Commentaries, de Bell. Civil. l. i.</NOTE>, which were, in the &s;ame manner, continued to all his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. The con&s;uls had &s;ucceeded to the kings of Rome, and repre&s;ented the dignity of the &s;tate. They &s;uperintended the ceremonies of religion, levied and commanded the legions, gave audience to foreign amba&s;&s;adors, and pre|&s;ided in the a&s;&s;emblies both of the &s;enate and people. The general control of the finances was intru&s;ted to their care; and though they &s;eldom had lei&s;ure to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice in per&s;on, they were con&s;idered as the &s;upreme guardians of law, equity, and the public peace. Such was their ordinary juri&s;diction; but whenever the &s;enate empowered the fir&s;t magi&s;trate to con&s;ult the &s;afety of the commonwealth, he was rai&s;ed by that degree above the laws, and exerci&s;ed, in the defence of liberty, a temporary de&s;poti&s;m <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">Augu&s;tus exerci&s;ed nine annual con&s;ul&s;hips without interrup|tion.

Augu&s;tus, as well as his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, affected, however, to conceal &s;o invidious a title.</NOTE>.
<PB N="105" REF="129">
The character of the tribunes was, in every re|&s;pect, different from that of the con&s;uls. The appearance of the former was mode&s;t and hum|ble; but their per&s;ons were &s;acred and inviolable. Their force was &s;uited rather for oppo&s;ition than for action. They were in&s;tituted to defend the oppre&s;&s;ed, to pardon offences, to arraign the enemies of the people, and, when they judged it nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;top, by a &s;ingle word, the whole machine of government. As long as the repub|lic &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, the dangerous influence, which ei|ther the con&s;ul or the tribune might derive from their re&s;pective juri&s;diction, was dimini&s;hed by &s;everal important re&s;trictions. Their authority expired with the year in which they were elected; the former office was divided between two, the latter among ten per&s;ons; and, as both in their private and public intere&s;t they were aver&s;e to each other, their mutual conflicts contributed, for the mo&s;t part, to &s;trengthen rather than to de&s;troy the balance of the con&s;titution. But when the con&s;ular and tribunitian powers were united, when they were ve&s;ted for life in a &s;ingle per&s;on, when the general of the army was, at the &s;ame time, the mini&s;ter of the &s;enate and the repre&s;entative of the Roman people, it was im|po&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the exerci&s;e, nor was it ea&s;y to define the limits, of his Imperial prerogative.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="130">

Every power was derived from their authority, every law was ratified by their &s;anction. Their regular meetings were held on three &s;tated days in every month, the Calends, the Nones, and the Ides.

In the con&s;ideration of the Imperial govern|ment, we have frequently mentioned the artful founder, under his well-known title of Augu&s;tus, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Titles of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI></NOTE> which was not however conferred upon him, till the edifice was almo&s;t completed. The ob&s;cure name of Octavianus, he derived from a mean family, in the little town of Aricia. It was &s;tain|ed with the blood of the pro&s;cription; and he was de&s;irous, had it been po&s;&s;ible, to era&s;e all memory of his former life. The illu&s;trious &s;ur|name of Cae&s;ar, he had a&s;&s;umed, as the adopted &s;on of the dictator; but he had too much good &s;en&s;e, either to hope to be confounded, or to wi&s;h to be compared, with that extraordinary man. It was propo&s;ed in the &s;enate, to dignify their mini&s;ter with a new appellation: and after a very &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, that of Augu&s;tus was cho&s;en, among &s;everal others, as being the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of the character of peace and &s;anctity, which he uniformly affected <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">Dion Ca&s;&s;ius, l. liii. p. 710. with the curious Annotations of Reymar.</NOTE>. <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> was therefore a per&s;onal, <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> a family di&s;tinction.

But, at the time of his death, the practice of a century had in&s;eparably connected tho&s;e appellations with the Imperial dignity, and they have been pre&s;erved by a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of

emperors, Romans, Greeks, Franks, and Ger|mans, from the fall of the republic to the pre|&s;ent time. A di&s;tinction was, however, &s;oon introduced. The &s;acred title of Augu&s;tus was always re&s;erved for the monarch, whil&s;t the name of Cae&s;ar was more freely communicated to his relations; and, from the reign of Hadrian, at lea&s;t, was appropriated to the &s;econd per&s;on in the &s;tate, who was con&s;idered as the pre&s;umptive heir of the empire.</P>
<P>The tender re&s;pect of Augu&s;tus for a free con|&s;titution <NOTE PLACE="marg">Character and policy of Augu&s;|tus.</NOTE> which he had de&s;troyed, can only be explained by an attentive con&s;ideration of the character of that &s;ubtle tyrant. A cool head, an unfeeling heart, and a cowardly di&s;po&s;ition, prompted him, at the age of nineteen, to a&s;&s;ume the ma&s;k of hypocri&s;y, which he never afterwards laid a&s;ide. With the &s;ame hand, and probably with the &s;ame temper, he &s;igned the pro&s;cription of Cicero, and the pardon of Cinna.

The fidelity of the legions might defend his authority again&s;t open rebellion; but their vigi|lance could not &s;ecure his per&s;on from the dag|ger of a determined republican; and the Romans, who revered the memory of Brutus <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">Two centuries after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of monarchy, the empe|ror Marcus Antoninus recommends the character of Brutus as a per|fect model of Roman virtue.</NOTE>, would ap|plaud the imitation of his virtue.

<P>There appears, indeed, <HI>one</HI> memorable occa|&s;ion, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt of the &s;e|nate after the death of Caligu|la.</NOTE> in which the &s;enate, after &s;eventy years of patience, made an ineffectual attempt to rea&s;&s;ume its long forgotten rights.

De&s;erted by the people, and threatened by a military force, that feeble a&s;&s;embly was compelled to ratify the choice of the Praetorians, and to embrace the benefit of an amne&s;ty, which Claudius had the prudence to offer, and the ge|nero&s;ity to ob&s;erve <NOTE N="28" PLACE="foot">It is much to be regretted, that we have lo&s;t the part of Tacitus, which treated of that tran&s;action.

<P>During a long period of two hundred and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their obe|dience.</NOTE> twenty years, from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this art|ful &s;y&s;tem to the death of Commodus, the dan|gers inherent to a military government were, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;u&s;pended.

Caligula and Domitian were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in their palace by their own dome&s;tics: the convul&s;ions which agitated Rome on the death of the former, were confined to the walls of the city. But Nero involved the

<P>Upon the death of his father, Commodus <NOTE PLACE="marg">He returns to Rome.</NOTE> found him&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed with the command of a great army, and the conduct of a difficult war again&s;t the Quadi and Marcomanni <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">According to Tertullian (Apolog. c. 25.), he died at Sirmium.

The &s;ervile and profligate youths whom Marcus had bani&s;hed, &s;oon regained their &s;tation and influ|ence about the new emperor.

By a dextrous application to his &s;en&s;ual appetites, they compared the tranquillity, the &s;plendour, the refined plea&s;ures of Rome, with the tumult of a Pannonian camp, which afforded neither lei&s;ure nor materials for luxury <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Herodian, l. i. p. 12.</NOTE>. Commodus li&s;tened to the plea&s;ing advice; but whil&s;t he he&s;itated between his own inclination, and the awe which he &s;till retained for his father's coun&s;ellors, the &s;ummer in&s;en&s;ibly elap&s;ed, and his triumphal entry into the capital was deferred till the autumn.

The young prince and his profligate favourites revel|led in all the licence of &s;overeign power; but his hands were yet un&s;tained with blood; and he had even di&s;played a genero&s;ity of &s;entiment, which might perhaps have ripened into &s;olid virtue <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">Manilius, the confidential &s;ecretary of Avidius Ca&s;&s;ius, was di&s;covered after he had lain concealed &s;everal years.

not in the &s;tate, but within the walls of the palace. Lucilla, the emperor's &s;i&s;ter, and widow of Lucius Verus, impatient of the &s;econd rank, and jealous of the reigning empre&s;s, had armed the murderer again&s;t her brother's life.

Tho&s;e whom he had dreaded as importunate mini&s;ters, he now &s;u&s;pected as &s;ecret enemies. The Delators, a race of men di&s;cou|raged, and almo&s;t extingui&s;hed, under the for|mer reigns; again became formidable, as &s;oon as they di&s;covered that the emperor was de&s;irous of finding di&s;affection and trea&s;on in the &s;enate. That a&s;&s;embly, whom Marcus had ever con&s;idered as the great council of the nation, was compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of the Romans; and di&s;tinction of every kind &s;oon became criminal.

The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth &s;timulated the diligence of the informers; rigid virtue implied a tacit cen&s;ure of the irregularities of Commodus; im|portant &s;ervices implied a dangerous &s;uperiority of merit; and the friend&s;hip of the father always en&s;ured the aver&s;ion of the &s;on. Su&s;picion was equivalent to proof. Trial to condemnation. The execution of a con&s;iderable &s;enator was at|tended with the death of all who might lament or revenge his fate; and when Commodus had once ta&s;ted human blood, he became incapable of pity or remor&s;e.</P>

Their &s;tudies and their occupations, their pur&s;uits and their plea&s;ures, were &s;till the &s;ame. In the enjoyment of a great e&s;tate, they never admitted the idea of a &s;eparate intere&s;t; &s;ome fragments are now extant of a treati&s;e which they compo&s;ed in common; and in every action of life it was ob&s;erved, that their two bodies were animated by one &s;oul.

<P>The tyrant's rage, after having &s;hed the noble&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">The mi|ni&s;ter Per|ennis.</NOTE> blood of the &s;enate, at length recoiled on the principal in&s;trument of his cruelty. Whil&s;t Com|modus was immer&s;ed in blood and luxury, he devolved the detail of the public bu&s;ine&s;s on Per|ennis; a &s;ervile and ambitious mini&s;ter, who had obtained his po&s;t by the murder of his pre|dece&s;&s;or, but who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable &s;hare of vigour and ability. By acts of extortion, and the forfeited e&s;tates of the nobles &s;acrificed to his avarice, he had accumulated an immen&s;e trea|&s;ure. The Praetorian guards were under his im|mediate command; and his &s;on, who already di&s;covered a military genius, was at the head of the Illyrian legions. Perennis a&s;pired to the empire; or what, in the eyes of Commodus, amounted to the &s;ame crime, he was capable of a&s;piring to it, had he not been prevented, &s;ur|pri&s;ed, and put to death. The fall of a mini&s;ter <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 186.</NOTE> is a very trifling incident in the general hi&s;tory of the empire; but it was ha&s;tened by an extra|ordinary circum&s;tance, which proved how much the nerves of di&s;cipline were already relaxed. The legions of Britain, di&s;contented with the admini&s;tration of Perennis, formed a deputation of fifteen hundred &s;elect men, with in&s;tructions to march to Rome, and lay their complaints before the emperor. The&s;e military petitioners,

<P>The negligence of the public admini&s;tration <NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of Maternus.</NOTE> was betrayed &s;oon afterwards, by a new di&s;order which aro&s;e from the &s;malle&s;t beginnings. A &s;pirit of de&s;ertion began to prevail among the troops; and the de&s;erters, in&s;tead of &s;eeking their &s;afety in flight or concealment, infe&s;ted the highways. Maternus, a private &s;oldier, of a daring boldne&s;s above his &s;tation, collected the&s;e bands of robbers into a little army, &s;et open the pri&s;ons, invited the &s;laves to a&s;&s;ert their freedom, and plundered with impunity the rich and de|fencele&s;s cities of Gaul and Spain. The gover|nors of the provinces, who had long been the &s;pectators, and perhaps the partners, of his de|predations, were, at length, rou&s;ed from their &s;upine indolence by the threatening commands of the emperor.

For a few minutes they &s;at in &s;ilent &s;u&s;pence, doubtful of their unexpected deliver|ance, and &s;u&s;picious of the cruel artifices of Com|modus; but when at length they were a&s;&s;ured that the tyrant was no more, they re&s;igned them|&s;elves to all the tran&s;ports of joy and indignation.

<P>THE power of the &s;word is more &s;en&s;ibly felt in an exten&s;ive monarchy, than in a &s;mall community. It has been calculated by the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Proportion of the mi|litary force, to the num|ber of the people.</NOTE> able&s;t politicians, that no &s;tate, without being &s;oon exhau&s;ted, can maintain above the hun|dredth part of its members in arms and idlene&s;s. But although this relative proportion may be uniform, the influence of the army over the re&s;t of the &s;ociety will vary according to the degree of its po&s;itive &s;trength. The advantages of mi|litary &s;cience and di&s;cipline cannot be exerted, unle&s;s a proper number of &s;oldiers are united into one body, and actuated by one &s;oul. With a handful of men, &s;uch an union would be ineffec|tual; with an unwieldy ho&s;t, it would be im|practicable; and the powers of the machine would be alike de&s;troyed by the extreme mi|nutene&s;s, or the exce&s;&s;ive weight, of its &s;prings. To illu&s;trate this ob&s;ervation we need only reflect, that there is no &s;uperiority of natural &s;trength, artificial weapons, or acquired &s;kill, which could
<PB N="168" REF="192">
enable one man to keep in con&s;tant &s;ubjection one hundred of his fellow-creatures: the tyrant of a &s;ingle town, or a &s;mall di&s;trict, would &s;oon di&s;cover that an hundred armed followers were a weak defence again&s;t ten thou&s;and pea&s;ants or citi|zens; but an hundred thou&s;and well-di&s;ciplined &s;oldiers will command, with de&s;potic &s;way, ten millions of &s;ubjects; and a body of ten or fifteen thou&s;and guards will &s;trike terror into the mo&s;t numerous populace that ever crowded the &s;treets of an immen&s;e capital.</P>
<P>The Praetorian bands, who&s;e licentious fury <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Praetorian guards.</NOTE> was the fir&s;t &s;ymptom and cau&s;e of the decline of the Roman empire, &s;carcely amounted to the la&s;t mentioned number <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">They were originally nine or ten thou&s;and men (for Tacitus and Dion are not agreed upon the &s;ubject), divided into as many cohorts. Vitellius increa&s;ed them to &s;ixteen thou&s;and, and as far as we can learn from in&s;criptions, they never afterwards &s;unk much below that number. See Lip&s;ius de magnitudine Roman&acirc;, i. 4.</NOTE>. They derived their in&s;ti|tution <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their in|&s;titution.</NOTE> from Augu&s;tus. That crafty tyrant, &s;en|&s;ible that laws might colour, but that arms alone could maintain, his u&s;urped dominion, had gradually formed this powerful body of guards in con&s;tant readine&s;s to protect his per&s;on, to awe the &s;enate, and either to prevent or to cru&s;h the fir&s;t motions of rebellion. He di&s;tingui&s;hed the&s;e favoured troops by a double pay, and &s;u|perior privileges; but, as their formidable a&s;pect would at once have alarmed and irritated the Roman people, three cohorts only were &s;tationed in the capital; whil&s;t the remainder was di&s;|per&s;ed

Under the fair pretences of relieving Italy from the heavy burthen of military quarters, and of introdu|cing a &s;tricter di&s;cipline among the guards, he a&s;&s;embled them at Rome, in a permanent camp <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Tacit.

<P>Such formidable &s;ervants are always nece&s;&s;ary, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their &s;trength and con|fidence.</NOTE> but often fatal to the throne of de&s;poti&s;m. By thus introducing the Praetorian guards as it were into the palace and the &s;enate, the emperors taught them to perceive their own &s;trength, and the weakne&s;s of the civil government; to view the vices of their ma&s;ters with familiar contempt, and to lay a&s;ide that reverential awe, which di&s;|tance only, and my&s;tery, can pre&s;erve, towards an imaginary power. In the luxurious idlene&s;s of an opulent city, their pride was nouri&s;hed by the &s;en&s;e of their irre&s;i&s;tible weight; nor was it po&s;&s;ible to conceal from them, that the per&s;on of the &s;overeign, the authority of the &s;enate, the public trea&s;ure, and the &s;eat of empire, were all

in their hands. To divert the Praetorian bands from the&s;e dangerous reflections, the firme&s;t and be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed princes were obliged to mix blan|di&s;hments with commands, rewards with puni&s;h|ments, to flatter their pride, indulge their plea|&s;ures, connive at their irregularities, and to pur|cha&s;e their precarious faith by a liberal donative; which, &s;ince the elevation of Claudius, was ex|acted as a legal claim, on the acce&s;&s;ion of every new emperor <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Claudius, rai&s;ed by the &s;oldiers to the empire, was the fir&s;t who gave a donative.

<P>The advocates of the guards endeavoured to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their &s;pe|cious claims.</NOTE> ju&s;tify by arguments, the power which they a&s;|&s;erted by arms; and to maintain that, accord|ing to the pure&s;t principles of the con&s;titution, <HI>their</HI> con&s;ent was e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary in the ap|pointment of an emperor.

<P>The Praetorians had violated the &s;anctity of <NOTE PLACE="marg">They offer the empire to &s;ale.</NOTE> the throne, by the atrocious murder of Pertinax; they di&s;honoured the maje&s;ty of it, by their &s;ub|&s;equent conduct. The camp was without a leader, for even the praefect Laetus, who had excited the tempe&s;t, prudently declined the public indigna|tion. Amid&s;t the wild di&s;order Sulpicianus, the emperor's father-in-law, and governor of the city, who had been &s;ent to the camp on the fir&s;t alarm of mutiny, was endeavouring to calm the fury of the multitude, when he was &s;ilenced by the clamorous return of the murderers, bearing on a lance the head of Pertinax. Though hi&s;|tory has accu&s;tomed us to ob&s;erve every principle and every pa&s;&s;ion yielding to the imperious dic|tates of ambition, it is &s;carcely credible that, in the&s;e moments of horror, Sulpicianus &s;hould have a&s;pired to a&s;cend a throne polluted with the
<PB N="172" REF="196">
recent blood of &s;o near a relation, and &s;o excel|lent a prince. He had already begun to u&s;e the only effectual argument, and to treat for the Imperial dignity; but the more prudent of the Praetorians, apprehen&s;ive that, in this private contract, they &s;hould not obtain a ju&s;t price for &s;o valuable a commodity, ran out upon the ram|parts; and, with a loud voice, proclaimed that the Roman world was to be di&s;po&s;ed of to the be&s;t bidder by public auction <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Dion, l. lxxiii. p. 1234.

His wife and his daughter, his freedmen and his para&s;ites, ea&s;ily convinced him that he de&s;erved the throne, and earne&s;tly con|jured him to embrace &s;o fortunate an oppor|tunity. The vain old man ha&s;tened to the Prae|torian camp, where Sulpicianus was &s;till in treaty with the guards; and began to bid again&s;t him from the foot of the rampart. The unworthy negociation was tran&s;acted by faithful emi&s;&s;aries, who pa&s;&s;ed alternately from one candidate to the other, and acquainted each of them with the

Sulpicianus had already pro|mi&s;ed a donative of five thou&s;and drachms (above one hundred and &s;ixty pounds) to each &s;oldier; when Julian, eager for the prize, ro&s;e at once to the &s;um of &s;ix thou&s;and two hundred and fifty drachms, or upwards of two hundred pounds &s;terling. The gates of the camp were in&s;tantly thrown open to the purcha&s;er; he was declared emperor, and received an oath of allegiance from the &s;oldiers, who retained humanity enough to &s;tipulate that he &s;hould pardon and forget the competition of Sulpicianus.</P>
<P>It was now incumbent on the Praetorians to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Julian is acknow|ledged by the &s;enate.</NOTE> fulfil the conditions of the &s;ale.

civility of the emperor with &s;miles of com|placency, and profe&s;&s;ions of duty. But the peo|ple, &s;ecure in their numbers and ob&s;curity, gave a free vent to their pa&s;&s;ions. The &s;treets and public places of Rome re&s;ounded with clamours and imprecations. The enraged multitude af|fronted the per&s;on of Julian, rejected his libera|lity, and con&s;cious of the impotence of their own re&s;entment, they called aloud on the legions of the frontiers to a&s;&s;ert the violated maje&s;ty of the Roman empire.</P>
<P>The public di&s;content was &s;oon diffu&s;ed from <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ar|mies of Britain, Syria, and Pannonia declare a|gain&s;t Ju|lian.</NOTE> the centre to the frontiers of the empire.

They received with &s;urpri&s;e, with indignation, and perhaps with envy, the extraordinary intelligence, that the Praetorians had di&s;po&s;ed of the empire by public auction; and they &s;ternly refu&s;ed to ratify the ignominious bargain. Their immediate and una|nimous revolt was fatal to Julian, but it was fatal at the &s;ame time to the public peace; as the generals of the re&s;pective armies, Clodius Albinus, Pe&s;cennius Niger, and Septimius Se|verus, were &s;till more anxious to &s;ucceed than to revenge the murdered Pertinax. Their forces were exactly balanced. Each of them was at the head of three legions <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">Dion, l. lxxiii. p. 1235.</NOTE>, with a numerous train of auxiliaries; and however different in their

But the branch from whence he claimed his de&s;cent, was &s;unk into mean circum&s;tances, and tran&s;planted into a remote province. It is dif|ficult to form a ju&s;t idea of his true character. Under the philo&s;ophic cloak of au&s;terity, he &s;tands accu&s;ed of concealing mo&s;t of the vices which degrade human nature <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">Spartianus, in his undige&s;ted collections, mixes up all the vir|tues and all the vices that enter into the human compo&s;ition, and be&s;tows them on the &s;ame object.

But his accu&s;ers are tho&s;e venal writers who adored the fortune of Severus, and trampled on the a&s;hes of an un|&s;ucce&s;sful rival. Virtue, or the appearances of virtue, recommended Albinus to the confidence and good opinion of Marcus; and his pre&s;erving with the &s;on the &s;ame intere&s;t which he had ac|quired with the father, is a proof at lea&s;t that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very flexible di&s;po&s;ition.

But the concealed ambu&s;cades of the Caledonians, who hung un|&s;een on the rear and flanks of his army, the coldne&s;s of the climate, and the &s;everity of a winter march acro&s;s the hills and mora&s;&s;es of Scotland, are reported to have co&s;t the Romans above fifty thou&s;and men.

But their apparent &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion la&s;ted no longer than the pre&s;ent terror. As &s;oon as the Roman legi|ons had retired, they re&s;umed their ho&s;tile inde|pendence.

It was propo&s;ed, that &s;ince it was im|po&s;&s;ible to reconcile their minds, they &s;hould &s;eparate their intere&s;t, and divide the empire between them.

But no &s;ooner had he a&s;&s;umed the reins of government, than he fre|quently intimated the in&s;ufficiency of the tri|butes, and the nece&s;&s;ity of throwing an equitable proportion of the public burden upon Rome and Italy. In the pro&s;ecution of this unpopular de|&s;ign, he advanced, however, by cautious and well-weighed &s;teps. The introduction of cu&s;toms was followed by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an exci&s;e,
<PB N="261" REF="285">
and the &s;cheme of taxation was completed by an artful a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment on the real and per&s;onal pro|perty of the Roman citizens, who had been ex|empted from any kind of contribution above a century and a half.</P>
<P N="1">I. In a great empire like that of Rome, a <NOTE PLACE="marg">The cu&s;|toms.</NOTE> natural balance of money mu&s;t have gradually e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf. It has been already ob&s;erved, that as the wealth of the provinces was attracted to the capital by the &s;trong hand of conque&s;t and power; &s;o a con&s;iderable part of it was re&s;tored to the indu&s;trious provinces by the gentle influ|ence of commerce and arts. In the reign of Augu&s;tus and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, duties were im|po&s;ed on every kind of merchandi&s;e, which through a thou&s;and channels flowed to the great centre of opulence and luxury; and in what|&s;oever manner the law was expre&s;&s;ed, it was the Roman purcha&s;er, and not the provincial mer|chant, who paid the tax <NOTE N="97" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Annal. xiii. 31.</NOTE>. The rate of the cu&s;toms varied from the eighth to the fortieth part of the value of the commodity; and we have a right to &s;uppo&s;e that the variation was directed by the unalterable maxims of policy: that a higher duty was fixed on the articles of luxury than on tho&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, and that the produc|tions rai&s;ed or manufactured by the labour of the &s;ubjects of the empire, were treated with more indulgence than was &s;hewn to the pernicious, or at lea&s;t the unpopular commerce of Arabia and

India <NOTE N="98" PLACE="foot">See Pliny (Hi&s;t. Natur. l. vi. c. 23. l. xii. c. 18.).

There is &s;till extant a long but im|perfect catalogue of ea&s;tern commodities, which about the time of Alexander Severus were &s;ubject to the payment of duties; cinnamon, myrrh, pepper, ginger, and the whole tribe of aromatics, a great variety of precious &s;tones, among which the diamond was the mo&s;t remarkable for its price, and the emerald for its beauty <NOTE N="99" PLACE="foot">The ancients were unacquainted with the art of cutting dia|monds.</NOTE>: Parthian and Babylonian leather, cottons, &s;ilks, both raw and manufactured, ebony, ivory, and eunuchs <NOTE N="100" PLACE="foot">M.

<P N="2">II. The exci&s;e, introduced by Augu&s;tus after the civil wars, was extremely moderate, but it <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ex|ci&s;e.</NOTE> was general.

Such a tax, as it affects the body of the people, has ever been the occa&s;ion of clamour and di&s;content. An emperor well acquainted
<PB N="263" REF="287">
with the wants and re&s;ources of the &s;tate, was obliged to declare by a public edict, that the &s;upport of the army depended in a great mea&s;ure on the produce of the exci&s;e <NOTE N="101" PLACE="foot">Tacit.

The ample revenue of the exci&s;e, though peculiarly appro|priated to tho&s;e u&s;es, was found inadequate. To &s;upply the deficiency, the emperor &s;ugge&s;ted a new tax of five <HI>per cent.</HI> on all legacies and inheritances. But the nobles of Rome were more tenacious of property than of freedom. Their indignant murmurs were received by Au|gu&s;tus with his u&s;ual temper. He candidly re|ferred the whole bu&s;ine&s;s to the &s;enate, and ex|horted them to provide for the public &s;ervice by &s;ome other expedient of a le&s;s odious nature.

<P>Such a tax, plentiful as it mu&s;t prove in every <NOTE PLACE="marg">Suited to the laws and man|ners.</NOTE> wealthy community, was mo&s;t happily &s;uited to the &s;ituation of the Romans, who could frame their arbitrary wills, according to the dictates of rea&s;on or caprice, without any re&s;traint from the modern fetters of entails and &s;ettlements. From various cau&s;es the partiality of paternal affection often lo&s;t its influence over the &s;tern patriots of the commonwealth, and the di&s;&s;olute nobles of the empire; and if the father bequeathed to his &s;on the fourth part of his e&s;tate, he removed all ground of legal complaint <NOTE N="106" PLACE="foot">See Heineccius in the Antiquit.

Yet, while &s;o many unju&s;t and extravagant wills were every day dictated by cunning, and &s;ub&s;cribed by folly, a few were the re&s;ult of rational e&s;teem and vir|tuous gratitude.

<P>In the fir&s;t and golden years of the reign of Nero, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Regulati|ons of the emperors.</NOTE> that prince, from a de&s;ire of popularity, and perhaps from a blind impul&s;e of benevolence, conceived a wi&s;h of aboli&s;hing the oppre&s;&s;ion of the cu&s;toms and exci&s;e.

Nor was the rapacious &s;on of Severus contented with &s;uch a mea&s;ure of taxation, as had appeared &s;ufficient to his moderate predece&s;&s;ors.

<P>OF the various forms of government, which have prevailed in the world, an hereditary monarchy &s;eems to pre&s;ent the faire&s;t &s;cope for ridicule.

Satire and declamation may paint the&s;e obvious topics in the mo&s;t dazzling colours, but our more &s;erious thoughts will re|&s;pect a u&s;eful prejudice, that e&s;tabli&s;hes a rule of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, independent of the pa&s;&s;ions of man|kind; and we &s;hall cheerfully acquie&s;ce in any expedient which deprives the multitude of the dangerous, and indeed the ideal, power of giving them&s;elves a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the cool &s;hade of retirement, we may ea&s;ily <NOTE PLACE="marg">and &s;olid advantages of heredi|tary &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> devi&s;e imaginary forms of government, in which
<PB N="271" REF="295">
the &s;ceptre &s;hall be con&s;tantly be&s;towed on the mo&s;t worthy, by the free and incorrupt &s;uffrage of the whole community. Experience overturns the&s;e airy fabrics, and teaches us, that, in a large &s;ociety, the election of a monarch can never de|volve to the wi&s;e&s;t, or to the mo&s;t numerous, part of the people. The army is the only order of men &s;ufficiently united to concur in the &s;ame &s;en|timents, and powerful enough to impo&s;e them on the re&s;t of their fellow-citizens: but the tem|per of &s;oldiers, habituated at once to violence and to &s;lavery, renders them very unfit guardians of a legal, or even a civil con&s;titution. Ju&s;tice, humanity, or political wi&s;dom, are qualities they are too little acquainted with in them&s;elves, to appreciate them in others. Valour will acquire their e&s;teem, and liberality will purcha&s;e their &s;uffrage; but the fir&s;t of the&s;e merits is often lodged in the mo&s;t &s;avage brea&s;ts; the latter can only exert it&s;elf at the expence of the public; and both may be turned again&s;t the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the throne, by the ambition of a daring rival.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior prerogative of birth, when it has <NOTE PLACE="marg">Want of it in the Ro|man em|pire pro|ductive of the greate&s;t calamities.</NOTE> obtained the &s;anction of time and popular opi|nion, is the plaine&s;t and lea&s;t invidious of all di&s;tinctions among mankind. The acknowledged right extingui&s;hes the hopes of faction, and the con&s;cious &s;ecurity di&s;arms the cruelty of the mo|narch. To the firm e&s;tabli&s;hment of this idea, we owe the peaceful &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and mild admi|ni&s;tration, of European monarchies. To the de|fect of it, we mu&s;t attribute the frequent civil
<PB N="272" REF="296">
wars, through which an A&s;iatic De&s;pot is obliged to cut his way to the throne of his fathers. Yet, even in the Ea&s;t, the &s;phere of contention is u&s;ually limited to the princes of the reigning hou&s;e, and as &s;oon as the more fortunate compe|titor has removed his brethren, by the &s;word and the bow-&s;tring, he no longer entertains any jea|lou&s;y of his meaner &s;ubjects. But the Roman empire, after the authority of the &s;enate had &s;unk into contempt, was a va&s;t &s;cene of confu&s;ion. The royal, and even noble, families of the pro|vinces, had long &s;ince been led in triumph before the car of the haughty republicans. The ancient families of Rome had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively fallen beneath the tyranny of the Cae&s;ars; and whil&s;t tho&s;e princes were &s;hackled by the forms of a common|wealth, and di&s;appointed by the repeated failure of their po&s;terity <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">There had been no example of three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations on the throne; only three in&s;tances of &s;ons who &s;ucceeded their fathers.

The right to the throne, which none could claim from birth, every one a&s;&s;umed from merit. The daring hopes of ambition were &s;et loo&s;e from the &s;alutary re&s;traints of law and prejudice; and the meane&s;t of mankind might, without folly, entertain a hope of being rai&s;ed by valour and fortune to a rank in the army, in which a &s;ingle crime would enable him to wre&s;t the &s;ceptre of the world from his feeble and unpopular ma&s;ter. After the mur|der
<PB N="273" REF="297">
of Alexander Severus, and the elevation of Maximin, no emperor could think him&s;elf &s;afe upon the throne, and every barbarian pea&s;ant of the frontier might a&s;pire to that augu&s;t, but dan|gerous &s;tation.</P>
<P>About thirty-two years before that event, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Birth and fortunes of Maximin.</NOTE> emperor Severus, returning from an ea&s;tern ex|pedition, halted in Thrace, to celebrate, with military games, the birth-day of his younger &s;on, Geta. The country flocked in crowds to behold their &s;overeign, and a young barbarian of gigantic &s;tature earne&s;tly &s;olicited, in his rude dialect, that he might be allowed to contend for the prize of wre&s;tling. As the pride of di&s;cipline would have been di&s;graced in the overthrow of a Roman &s;oldier by a Thracian pea&s;ant, he was matched with the &s;toute&s;t followers of the camp, &s;ixteen of whom he &s;ucce&s;&s;ively laid on the ground. His victory was rewarded by &s;ome trifling gifts, and a permi&s;&s;ion to inli&s;t in the troops. The next day, the happy barbarian was di&s;tingui&s;hed above a crowd of recruits, dancing and exulting after the fa&s;hion of his country. As &s;oon as he perceived that he had attracted the emperor's notice, he in&s;tantly ran up to his hor&s;e, and fol|lowed him on foot, without the lea&s;t appearance of fatigue, in a long and rapid career. <Q>Thra|cian, &s;aid Severus, with a&s;toni&s;hment, art thou di&s;po&s;ed to wre&s;tle after thy race?</Q> Mo&s;t willingly, Sir, replied the unwearied youth, and, almo&s;t in a breath, overthrew &s;even of the &s;tronge&s;t &s;oldiers in the army. A gold collar was

the prize of his matchle&s;s vigour and activity, and he was immediately appointed to &s;erve in the hor&s;e-guards who always attended on the per&s;on of the &s;overeign <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Augu&s;t. p. 138.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Maximin, for that was his name, though born on the territories of the empire, de&s;cended from <NOTE PLACE="marg">His mili|tary &s;ervice and ho|nours.</NOTE> a mixed race of barbarians. His father was a Goth, and his mother, of the nation of the Alani. He di&s;played, on every occa&s;ion, a valour equal to his &s;trength; and his native fiercene&s;s was &s;oon tempered or di&s;gui&s;ed by the knowledge of the world. Under the reign of Severus and his &s;on, he obtained the rank of centurion, with the favour and e&s;teem of both tho&s;e princes, the for|mer of whom was an excellent judge of merit. Gratitude forbade Maximin to &s;erve under the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of Caracalla. Honour taught him to decline the effeminate in&s;ults of Elagabalus. On the acce&s;&s;ion of Alexander he returned to court, and was placed by that prince in a &s;tation u&s;eful to the &s;ervice, and honourable to him&s;elf. The fourth legion, to which he was appointed tribune, &s;oon became, under his care, the be&s;t di&s;ciplined of the whole army. With the general applau&s;e of the &s;oldiers, who be&s;towed on their favourite hero the names of Ajax and Hercules, he was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively promoted to the fir&s;t military com|mand <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

<P>In&s;tead of &s;ecuring his fidelity, the&s;e favours <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;pi|racy of Maximin.</NOTE> &s;erved only to inflame the ambition of the Thra|cian pea&s;ant, who deemed his fortune inadequate to his merit, as long as he was con&s;trained to acknowledge a &s;uperior. Though a &s;tranger to real wi&s;dom, he was not devoid of a &s;elfi&s;h cun|ning, which &s;hewed him, that the emperor had lo&s;t the affection of the army, and taught him to improve their di&s;content to his own advantage. It is ea&s;y for faction and calumny to &s;hed their poi&s;on on the admini&s;tration of the be&s;t of princes, and to accu&s;e even their virtues, by artfully con|founding them with tho&s;e vices to which they bear the neare&s;t affinity. The troops li&s;tened with plea&s;ure to the emi&s;&s;aries of Maximin. They blu&s;hed at their own ignominious patience, which, during thirteen years, had &s;upported the vexatious di&s;cipline impo&s;ed by an effeminate Sy|rian, the timid &s;lave of his mother and of the &s;enate. It was time, they cried, to ca&s;t away that u&s;ele&s;s phantom of the civil power, and to elect for their prince and general a real &s;oldier, educated in camps, exerci&s;ed in war, who would a&s;&s;ert the glory, and di&s;tribute among his com|panions the trea&s;ures of the empire. A great

army was at that time a&s;&s;embled on the banks of the Rhine, under the command of the emperor him&s;elf, who, almo&s;t immediately after his return from the Per&s;ian war, had been obliged to march again&s;t the barbarians of Germany. The im|portant care of training and reviewing the new levies was intru&s;ted to Maximin. One day, as he entered the field of exerci&s;e, the troops, either from a &s;udden impul&s;e or a formed con&s;pi|racy, &s;aluted him emperor, &s;ilenced by their loud acclamations his ob&s;tinate refu&s;al, and ha&s;tened to con&s;ummate their rebellion by the murder of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

The writers, who &s;uppo&s;e that he died in ignorance of the ingratitude and ambition of Maximin, affirm, that, after taking a frugal re|pa&s;t in the &s;ight of the army, he retired to &s;leep, and that, about the &s;eventh hour of the day, a part of his own guards broke into the Imperial tent, and, with many wounds, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated their virtuous and un&s;u&s;pecting prince <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

public declarations of the great army. Alexan|der had &s;ufficient time to awaken a faint &s;en&s;e of loyalty among his troops; but their reluctant profe&s;&s;ions of fidelity quickly vani&s;hed on the ap|pearance of Maximin, who declared him&s;elf the friend and advocate of the military order, and was unanimou&s;ly acknowledged emperor of the Romans by the applauding legions. The &s;on of Mamaea, betrayed and de&s;erted, withdrew into his tent, de&s;irous at lea&s;t to conceal his approach|ing fate from the in&s;ults of the multitude. He was &s;oon followed by a tribune and &s;ome centu|rions, the mini&s;ters of death; but, in&s;tead of re|ceiving with manly re&s;olution the inevitable &s;troke, his unavailing cries and entreaties di&s;|graced the la&s;t moments of his life, and con|verted into contempt &s;ome portion of the ju&s;t pity which his innocence and misfortunes mu&s;t in&s;pire. His mother Mamaea, who&s;e pride and avarice he loudly accu&s;ed as the cau&s;e of his ruin, peri&s;hed with her &s;on. The mo&s;t faithful of his friends were &s;acrificed to the fir&s;t fury of the &s;oldiers. Others were re&s;erved for the more deliberate cruelty of the u&s;urper; and tho&s;e who experi|enced the milde&s;t treatment, were &s;tripped of their employments, and ignominiou&s;ly driven from the court and army <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Herodian, l. vi. p. 223&mdash;227.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The former tyrants, Caligula and Nero, Com|modus <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tyranny of Maxi|min.</NOTE> and Caracalla, were all di&s;&s;olute and un|experienced youths <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Caligula, the elde&s;t of the four, was only twenty-five years of age when he a&s;cended the throne; Caracalla was twenty-three, Commodus nineteen, and Nero no more than &s;eventeen.</NOTE>, educated in the purple, and
<PB N="278" REF="302">
corrupted by the pride of empire, the luxury of Rome, and the perfidious voice of flattery. The cruelty of Maximin was derived from a different &s;ource, the fear of contempt. Though he de|pended on the attachment of the &s;oldiers, who loved him for virtues like their own, he was con|&s;cious that his mean and barbarian origin, his &s;a|vage appearance, and his total ignorance of the arts and in&s;titutions of civil life <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">It appears that he was totally ignorant of the Greek language; which, from its univer&s;al u&s;e in conver&s;ation and letters, was an e&s;&s;ential part of every liberal education.</NOTE>, formed a very unfavourable contra&s;t with the amiable manners of the unhappy Alexander. He remembered, that, in his humbler fortune, he had often waited before the door of the haughty nobles of Rome, and had been denied admittance by the in&s;olence of their &s;laves. He recollected too the friend&s;hip of a few who had relieved his poverty, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted his ri&s;ing hopes. But tho&s;e who had &s;purned, and tho&s;e who had protected the Thracian, were guilty of the &s;ame crime, the knowledge of his original ob&s;curity. For this crime many were put to death; and by the execution of &s;everal of his benefactors, Maximin publi&s;hed, in charac|ters of blood, the indelible hi&s;tory of his ba&s;ene&s;s and ingratitude <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

with the &s;ound of trea&s;on, his cruelty was un|bounded and unrelenting. A con&s;piracy again&s;t his life was either di&s;covered or imagined, and Magnus, a con&s;ular &s;enator, was named as the principal author of it. Without a witne&s;s, with|out a trial, and without an opportunity of de|fence, Magnus, with four thou&s;and of his &s;up|po&s;ed accomplices, were put to death. Italy and the whole empire were infe&s;ted with innumerable &s;pies and informers. On the &s;lighte&s;t accu&s;ation, the fir&s;t of the Roman nobles, who had governed provinces, commanded armies, and been adorned with the con&s;ular and triumphal ornaments, were chained on the public carriages, and hurried away to the emperor's pre&s;ence. Confi&s;cation, exile, or &s;imple death, were e&s;teemed uncommon in&s;tances of his lenity. Some of the unfortunate &s;ufferers he ordered to be &s;ewed up in the hides of &s;laughtered animals, others to be expo&s;ed to wild bea&s;ts, others again to be beaten to death with clubs. During the three years of his reign, he di&s;dained to vi&s;it either Rome or Italy. His camp, occa&s;ionally, removed from the banks of the Rhine to tho&s;e of the Danube, was the &s;eat of his &s;tern de&s;poti&s;m, which trampled on every principle of law and ju&s;tice, and was &s;upported by the avowed power of the &s;word <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">The wife of Maximin, by in&s;inuating wi&s;e coun&s;els with fe|male gentlene&s;s, &s;ometimes brought back the tyrant to the way of truth and humanity.

But the tyrant's avarice, &s;timulated by the in&s;atiate de&s;ires of the &s;oldiers, at length attacked the public pro|perty. Every city of the empire was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an independent revenue, de&s;tined to purcha&s;e corn for the multitude, and to &s;upply the ex|pences of the games and entertainments. By a &s;ingle act of authority, the whole ma&s;s of wealth was at once confi&s;cated for the u&s;e of the Impe|rial trea&s;ury. The temples were &s;tripped of their mo&s;t valuable offerings of gold and &s;ilver, and the &s;tatues of gods, heroes, and emperors were melted down and coined into money. The&s;e im|pious orders could not be executed without tu|mults and ma&s;&s;acres, as in many places the people cho&s;e rather to die in the defence of their altars, than to behold in the mid&s;t of peace their cities expo&s;ed to the rapine and cruelty of war.

Whil&s;t Maximus was preparing to defend Italy again&s;t the common foe, Balbinus, who remain|ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sedition at Rome.</NOTE> at Rome, had been engaged in &s;cenes of blood and inte&s;tine di&s;cord. Di&s;tru&s;t and jealou&s;y reigned in the &s;enate; and even in the temples where they a&s;&s;embled, every &s;enator carried either open or concealed arms. In the mid&s;t of their deliberations, two veterans of the guards, actu|ated either by curio&s;ity or a &s;ini&s;ter motive, auda|ciou&s;ly thru&s;t them&s;elves into the hou&s;e, and ad|vanced by degrees beyond the altar of Victory. Gallicanus, a con&s;ular, and Maecenas, a Praeto|rian &s;enator, viewed with indignation their in&s;o|lent intru&s;ion: drawing their daggers, they laid the &s;pies, for &s;uch they deemed them, dead at the foot of the altar, and then advancing to the door of the &s;enate, imprudently exhorted the multitude to ma&s;&s;acre the Praetorians, as the &s;ecret adherents of the tyrant. Tho&s;e who e&s;|caped the fir&s;t fury of the tumult took refuge in the camp, which they defended with &s;uperior advantage again&s;t the reiterated attacks of the people, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the numerous bands of gla|diators, the property of opulent nobles.

the factions at Rome. But their animo&s;ity, though &s;mothered for a while, burnt with re|doubled violence.

<P>After the tyrant's death, his formidable army <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;content of the Prae|torian guards.</NOTE> had acknowledged, from nece&s;&s;ity rather than from choice, the authority of Maximus, who tran&s;ported him&s;elf without delay to the camp before Aquileia. As &s;oon as he had received their oath of fidelity, he addre&s;&s;ed them in terms full of mildne&s;s and moderation; lamented, ra|ther than arraigned, the wild di&s;orders of the times, and a&s;&s;ured the &s;oldiers, that of all their pa&s;t conduct, the &s;enate would remember only their generous de&s;ertion of the tyrant, and their voluntary return to their duty. Maximus en|forced his exhortations by a liberal donative, purified the camp by a &s;olemn &s;acrifice of expia|tion, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the legions to their &s;eve|ral provinces, impre&s;&s;ed, as he hoped, with a lively &s;en&s;e of gratitude and obedience <NOTE N="41" PLACE="foot">Herodian, l. viii. p. 213.</NOTE>.

From the reign of Au|gu&s;tus to the time of Alexander Severus, the enemies of Rome were in her bo&s;om; the tyrants, and the &s;oldiers; and her pro&s;perity had a very di&s;tant and feeble intere&s;t in the revolutions that might happen beyond the Rhine and the Eu|phrates. But when the military order had le|velled, in wild anarchy, the power of the prince, the laws of the &s;enate, and even the di&s;cipline of the camp, the barbarians of the north and of the ea&s;t, who had long hovered on the frontier, boldly attacked the provinces of a declining mo|narchy. Their vexatious inroads were changed into formidable irruptions, and, after a long vi|ci&s;&s;itude of mutual calamities, many tribes of the victorious invaders e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in the provinces of the Roman empire. To obtain a clearer knowledge of the&s;e great events, we &s;hall endeavour to form a previous idea of the cha|racter, forces, and de&s;igns of tho&s;e nations who avenged the cau&s;e of Hannibal and Mithridates.</P>

In the more early ages of the world, whil&s;t the fore&s;t that covered Europe afforded a retreat to a few wandering &s;avages, the inhabitants of A&s;ia <NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolu|tions of A&s;ia.</NOTE> were already collected into populous cities, and reduced under exten&s;ive empires, the &s;eat of the arts, of luxury, and of de&s;poti&s;m.

As the latter of the&s;e great events hap|pened 289 years before Chri&s;t, the former may be placed 2184 years before the &s;ame aera. The A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations, found at Babylon by Alexander, went fifty years higher.</NOTE>, till the &s;ceptre of Ninus and Semiramis dropt from the hands of their enervated &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.

The fir&s;t and original Being, in whom, or by whom, the univer&s;e exi&s;ts, is denominated in the writings of Zoroa&s;ter, <HI>Time without bounds;</HI> but it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that this infinite &s;ub&s;tance &s;eems rather a metaphy&s;ical ab&s;traction of the mind, than a real object endowed with &s;elf-con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of moral perfections. From either the blind, or the intelligent operation of this in|finite Time, which bears but too near an affinity with the chaos of the Greeks, the two &s;econdary but active principles of the univer&s;e, were from all eternity produced, Ormu&s;d and Ahriman, each of them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the powers of creation, but each di&s;po&s;ed, by his invariable nature, to exerci&s;e them with different de&s;igns. The prin|ciple of good is eternally ab&s;orbed in light; the principle of evil eternally buried in darkne&s;s. The wi&s;e benevolence of Ormu&s;d formed man capable of virtue, and abundantly provided his fair habitation with the materials of happine&s;s. By his vigilant providence, the motion of the planets, the order of the &s;ea&s;ons, and the tem|perate mixture of the elements, are pre&s;erved. But the malice of Ahriman has long &s;ince pierced <HI>Ormu&s;d's egg;</HI> or, in other words, has violated the harmony of his works.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>The State of Germany till the Inva&s;ion of the Bar|barians, in the Time of the Emperor Decius.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE government and religion of Per&s;ia have de&s;erved &s;ome notice from their connexion with the decline and fall of the Roman empire. We &s;hall occa&s;ionally mention the Scythian, or Sarmatian tribes, which, with their arms and hor&s;es, their flocks and herds, their wives and families, wandered over the immen&s;e plains which &s;pread them&s;elves from the Ca&s;pian Sea to the Vi&s;tula, from the confines of Per&s;ia to tho&s;e of Germany. But the warlike Germans, who fir&s;t re&s;i&s;ted, then invaded, and at length overturned, the we&s;tern monarchy of Rome, will occupy a much more important place in this hi&s;tory, and po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;tronger, and, if we may u&s;e the expre&s;|&s;ion, a more dome&s;tic, claim to our attention and regard. The mo&s;t civilized nations of mo|dern Europe i&s;&s;ued from the woods of Germany, and in the rude in&s;titutions of tho&s;e barbarians we may &s;till di&s;tingui&s;h the original principles of our pre&s;ent laws and manners. In their primi|tive &s;tate of &s;implicity and independence, the Germans were &s;urveyed by the di&s;cerning eye, and delineated by the ma&s;terly pencil, of Tacitus, the fir&s;t of hi&s;torians who applied the &s;cience of philo&s;ophy to the &s;tudy of facts. The expre&s;&s;ive conci&s;ene&s;s of his de&s;criptions has de&s;erved to ex|erci&s;e
<PB N="345" REF="369">
the diligence of innumerable antiquarians, and to excite the genius and penetration of the philo&s;ophic hi&s;torians of our own times. The &s;ubject, however various and important, has al|ready been &s;o frequently, &s;o ably, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;s|fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, that it is now grown familiar to the reader, and difficult to the writer. We &s;hall therefore content our&s;elves with ob&s;erving, and indeed with repeating, &s;ome of the mo&s;t impor|tant circum&s;tances of climate, of manners, and of in&s;titutions, which rendered the wild barba|rians of Germany &s;uch formidable enemies to the Roman power.</P>
<P>Ancient Germany, excluding from its inde|pendent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Extent of Germany.</NOTE> limits the province we&s;tward of the Rhine, which had &s;ubmitted to the Roman yoke, extended it&s;elf over a third part of Europe. Al|mo&s;t the whole of modern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Livonia, Pru&s;&s;ia, and the greater part of Poland, were peopled by the various tribes of one great nation, who&s;e com|plexion, manners, and language denoted a com|mon origin, and pre&s;erved a &s;triking re&s;emblance. On the we&s;t, ancient Germany was divided by the Rhine from the Gallic, and on the &s;outh, by the Danube, from the Illyrian provinces of the empire. A ridge of hills, ri&s;ing from the Da|nube, and called the Carpathian Mountains, co|vered Germany on the &s;ide of Dacia or Hungary. The ea&s;tern frontier was faintly marked by the mutual fears of the Germans and the Sarmatians, and was often confounded by the mixture of war|ring and confederating tribes of the two nations.

Among a poli&s;hed people, a ta&s;te for poetry is rather an amu&s;ement of the fancy, than a pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul.

But how faint, how cold is the &s;en&s;ation which a peaceful mind can receive from &s;olitary &s;tudy! It was in the hour of battle, or in the fea&s;t of victory, that the bards celebrated the glory of heroes of ancient days, the ance&s;tors of tho&s;e warlike chieftains, who li&s;tened with tran&s;port to their artle&s;s but animated &s;trains. The view of arms and of danger heightened the effect of the military &s;ong; and the pa&s;&s;ions which it tended to excite, the de&s;ire of fame, and the contempt of death, were the habitual &s;entiments of a German mind <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">See Tacit.

In the heart of the Roman mo|narchy, the I&s;aurians long continued a nation of wild barbarians.
