<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Mayor, and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am extremely plea&s;ed at the appearance of this large and re&s;pectable meeting. The &s;teps I may be obliged to take will want the &s;anction of a con&s;iderable authority; and in ex|plaining any thing which may appear doubtful in my public conduct, I mu&s;t naturally de&s;ire a very full audience.</P>
<P>I have been backward to begin my canva&s;s. The di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament was uncertain; and it did not become me, by an un&s;ea&s;onable importunity, to appear diffident of the effect of my &s;ix years endeavours to plea&s;e you. I had &s;erved the city of Bri&s;tol honourably; and the city of Bri&s;tol had no rea&s;on to think, that the means of honourable &s;ervice to the public, were become indifferent to me.</P>
<P>I found on my arrival here, that three gen|tlemen had been long in eager pur&s;uit of an object which but two of us can obtain. I found, that they had all met with encouragement. A conte&s;ted election in &s;uch a city as this, is no light thing. I pau&s;ed on the brink of the precipice. The&s;e three gentlemen, by various
<PB N="2" REF="4">
merits, and on various titles, I made no doubt, were worthy of your favour. I &s;hall never attempt to rai&s;e my&s;elf by depreciating the merits of my competitors. In the complexity and confu&s;ion of the&s;e cro&s;s pur&s;uits, I wi&s;hed to take the authentic public &s;en&s;e of my friends upon a bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o much delicacy. I wi&s;hed to take your opinion along with me; that if I &s;hould give up the conte&s;t at the very beginning, my &s;urrender of my po&s;t may not &s;eem the effect of incon&s;tancy, or timidity, or anger, or di&s;gu&s;t, or indolence, or any other temper un|becoming a man who has engaged in the public &s;ervice. If, on the contrary, I &s;hould under|take the election, and fail of &s;ucce&s;s, I was full as anxious, that it &s;hould be manife&s;t to the whole world, that the peace of the city had not been broken by my ra&s;hne&s;s, pre&s;umption, or fond conceit of my own merit.</P>
<P>I am not come, by a fal&s;e and counterfeit &s;hew of deference to your judgment, to &s;educe it in my favour. I a&s;k it &s;eriou&s;ly and un|affectedly. If you wi&s;h that I &s;hould retire, I &s;hall not con&s;ider that advice as a cen|&s;ure upon my conduct, or an alteration in your &s;entiments; but as a rational &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the circum&s;tances of affairs. If, on the contrary, you &s;hould think it proper for me to proceed on my canva&s;s, if you will ri&s;que the trouble on your part, I will ri&s;que it on mine. My pre|ten&s;ions are &s;uch as you cannot be a&s;hamed of, whether they &s;ucceed or fail.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
If you call upon me, I &s;hall &s;olicit the favour of the city upon manly ground. I come before you with the plain confidence of an hone&s;t &s;er|vant in the equity of a candid and di&s;cerning ma&s;ter. I come to claim your approbation not to amu&s;e you with vain apologies, or with profe&s;|&s;ions &s;till more vain and &s;en&s;ele&s;s. I have lived too long to be &s;erved by apologies, or to &s;tand in need of them. The part I have acted has been in open day; and to hold out to a con|duct, which &s;tands in that clear and &s;teady light for all its good and all its evil, to hold out to that conduct the paltry winking tapers of excu&s;es and promi&s;es&mdash;I never will do it.&mdash;They may ob&s;cure it with their &s;moke; but they never can illumine &s;un&s;hine by &s;uch a flame as theirs.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that no endeavours have been left untried to injure me in your opinion. But the u&s;e of character is to be a &s;hield again&s;t ca|lumny. I could wi&s;h, undoubtedly (if idle wi&s;hes were not the mo&s;t idle of all things) to make every part of my conduct agreeable to every one of my con&s;tituents. But in &s;o great a city, and &s;o greatly divided as this, it is weak to expect it.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a di&s;cordancy of &s;entiments, it is better to look to the nature of things than to the humours of men. The very attempt towards plea&s;ing every body, di&s;covers a temper always fla&s;hy, and often fal&s;e and in&s;incere. Therefore, as I have proceeded &s;trait onward in my conduct,
<PB N="4" REF="6">
&s;o I will proceed in my account of tho&s;e parts of it which have been mo&s;t excepted to. But I mu&s;t fir&s;t beg leave ju&s;t to hint to you, that we may &s;uffer very great detriment by being open to every talker. It is not to be imagined, how much of &s;ervice is lo&s;t from &s;pirits full of activity and full of energy, who are pre&s;&s;|ing, who are ru&s;hing forward, to great and ca|pital objects, when you oblige them to be conti|nually looking back. Whil&s;t they are defend|ing one &s;ervice, they defraud you of an hundred. Applaud us when we run; con&s;ole us when we fall; cheer us when we recover; but let us pa&s;s on&mdash;for God's &s;ake, let us pa&s;s on.</P>
<P>Do you think, Gentlemen, that every public act in the &s;ix years &s;ince I &s;tood in this place be|fore you&mdash;that all the arduous things which have been done in this eventful period, which has crowded into a few years &s;pace the revolutions of an age, can be opened to you on their fair grounds in half an hour's conver&s;ation?</P>
<P>But it is no rea&s;on, becau&s;e there is a bad mode of enquiry, that there &s;hould be no exa|mination at all. Mo&s;t certainly it is our duty to examine; it is our intere&s;t too.&mdash;But it mu&s;t be with di&s;cretion; with an attention to all the circum&s;tances, and to all the motives; like &s;ound judges, and not like cavilling pettyfoggers and quibbling pleaders, prying into flaws and hunt|ing for exceptions. Look, Gentlemen, to the <HI>whole tenour</HI> of your member's conduct. Try
<PB N="5" REF="7">
whether his ambition or his avarice have ju&s;tled him out of the &s;trait line of duty; or whether that grand foe of the offices of active life, that ma&s;ter-vice in men of bu&s;ine&s;s, a degenerate and inglorious &s;loth, has made him flag and langui&s;h in his cour&s;e? This is the object of our enquiry. If our member's conduct can bear this touch, mark it for &s;terling. He may have fallen into errors; he mu&s;t have faults; but our error is greater, and our fault is radically ruinous to our&s;elves, if we do not bear, if we do not even applaud, the whole compound and mixed ma&s;s of &s;uch a character. Not to act thus is folly; I had almo&s;t &s;aid it is impiety. He cen&s;ures God, who quarrels with the imperfections of man.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, we mu&s;t not be peevi&s;h with tho&s;e who &s;erve the people. For none will &s;erve us whil&s;t there is a court to &s;erve, but tho&s;e who are of a nice and jealous honour. They who think every thing, in compari&s;on of that honour, to be du&s;t and a&s;hes, will not bear to have it &s;oiled and impaired by tho&s;e, for who&s;e &s;ake they make a thou&s;and &s;acrifices, to pre&s;erve it immaculate and whole. We &s;hall either drive &s;uch men from the public &s;tage, or we &s;hall &s;end them to the court for protection; where, if they mu&s;t &s;acrifice their reputation, they will at lea&s;t &s;ecure their intere&s;t. Depend upon it, that the lovers of freedom will be free. None will violate their con&s;cience to plea&s;e us, in order afterwards to di&s;charge that con&s;cience, which they
<PB N="6" REF="8">
have violated, by doing us faithful and affection|ate &s;ervice. If we degrade and deprave their minds by &s;ervility, it will be ab&s;urd to expect, that they who are creeping and abject toward us, will ever be bold and uncorruptible a&s;&s;ertors of our freedom, again&s;t the mo&s;t &s;educing and the mo&s;t formidable of all powers. No! human na|ture is not &s;o formed; nor &s;hall we improve the faculties, or better the morals of public men, by our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t infallible receipt in the world for making cheats and hypocrites.</P>
<P>Let me &s;ay with plainne&s;s, I who am no longer in a public character, that if by a fair, by an in|dulgent, by a gentlemanly behaviour to our re|pre&s;entatives, we do not give confidence to their minds, and a liberal &s;cope to their under&s;tand|ings; if we do not permit our members to act upon a <HI>very</HI> enlarged view of things; we &s;hall at length infallibly degrade our national repre|&s;entation into a confu&s;ed and &s;cuffling bu&s;tle of local agency. When the popular member is narrowed in his ideas, and rendered timid in his proceedings, the &s;ervice of the crown will be the &s;ole nur&s;ery of &s;tate&s;men. Among the frolics of the court, it may at length take that of attending to its bu&s;ine&s;s. Then the monopoly of mental power will be added to the power of all other kinds it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. On the &s;ide of the people there will be nothing but impotence: for ig|norance is impotence; narrowne&s;s of mind is impotence; timidity is it&s;elf impotence, and
<PB N="7" REF="9">
makes all other qualities that go along with it, impotent and u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, it is the plan of the court to make its &s;ervants in&s;ignificant. If the people &s;hould fall into the &s;ame humour, and &s;hould choo&s;e their &s;ervants on the &s;ame principles of mere ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, and flexibility, and total vacancy or indifference of opinion in all public matters, then no part of the &s;tate will be &s;ound; and it will be in vain to think of &s;aving of it.</P>
<P>I thought it very expedient at this time to give you this candid coun&s;el; and with this coun&s;el I would willingly clo&s;e, if the matters which at various times have been objected to me in this city concerned only my&s;elf, and my own election. The&s;e charges, I think, are four in number;&mdash;my neglect of a due attention to my con&s;tituents; the not paying more frequent vi&s;its here;&mdash;my conduct on the affairs of the fir&s;t Iri&s;h trade acts;&mdash;my opinion and mode of proceed|ing on Lord Beauchamp's Debtors Bills;&mdash;and my votes on the late affairs of the Roman Ca|tholics. All of the&s;e (except perhaps the fir&s;t) relate to matters of very con&s;iderable public concern; and it is not le&s;t you &s;hould cen&s;ure me improperly, but le&s;t you &s;hould form im|proper opinions on matters of &s;ome moment to you, that I trouble you at all upon the &s;ub|ject. My conduct is of &s;mall importance.</P>
<P>With regard to the fir&s;t charge, my friends have &s;poken to me of it in the &s;tyle of amicable expo&s;tulation; not &s;o much blaming the thing,
<PB N="8" REF="10">
as lamenting the effects.&mdash;Others, le&s;s partial to me, were le&s;s kind in a&s;&s;igning the motives. I admit, there is a decorum and propriety in a member of parliament's paying a re&s;pectful court to his con&s;tituents. If I were con&s;cious to my|&s;elf that plea&s;ure or di&s;&s;ipation, or low unworthy occupations, had detained me from per&s;onal attendance on you, I would readily admit my fault, and quietly &s;ubmit to the penalty. But, Gentlemen, I live at an hundred miles di&s;tance from Bri&s;tol; and at the end of a &s;e&s;&s;ion I come to my own hou&s;e, fatigued in body and in mind, to a little repo&s;e, and to a very little attention to my family and my private concerns. A vi&s;it to Bri&s;tol is always a &s;ort of canva&s;s; el&s;e it will do more harm than good. To pa&s;s from the toils of a &s;e&s;&s;ion to the toils of a canva&s;s, is the furthe&s;t thing in the world from repo&s;e. I could hardly &s;erve you <HI>as I have done,</HI> and court you too. Mo&s;t of you have heard, that I do not very remarkably &s;pare my&s;elf in <HI>public</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s; and in the <HI>private</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s of my con|&s;tituents I have done very near as much as tho&s;e who have nothing el&s;e to do. My canva&s;s of you was not on the Change, nor in the county meetings, nor in the clubs of this city. It was in the Hou&s;e of Commons; it was at the Cu&s;tom|hou&s;e; it was at the Council; it was at the Trea|&s;ury; it was at the Admiralty. I canva&s;&s;ed you through your affairs, and not your per&s;ons. I was not only your repre&s;entative as a body; I was the agent, the &s;olicitor of individuals; I ran
<PB N="9" REF="11">
about wherever your affairs could call me; and in acting for you I often appeared rather as a &s;hip-broker, than as a member of parliament. There was nothing too laborious, or too low for me to undertake. The meanne&s;s of the bu&s;ine&s;s was rai&s;ed by the dignity of the object. If &s;ome le&s;&s;er matters have &s;lipped through my fingers, it was becau&s;e I filled my hands too full; and in my eagerne&s;s to &s;erve you, took in more than any hands could gra&s;p. Several gentlemen &s;tand round me who are my willing witne&s;&s;es; and there are others who, if they were here, would be &s;till better; becau&s;e they would be unwilling witne&s;&s;es to the &s;ame truth. It was in the mid|dle of a &s;ummer re&s;idence in London, and in the middle of a negociation at the Admiralty for your trade, that I was called to Bri&s;tol; and this late vi&s;it, at this late day, has been po&s;&s;ibly in prejudice to your affairs.</P>
<P>Since I have touched upon this matter, let me &s;ay, Gentlemen, that if I had a di&s;po&s;ition, or a right to complain, I have &s;ome cau&s;e of complaint on my &s;ide. With a petition of this city in my hand, pa&s;&s;ed through the corporation without a di&s;&s;enting voice, a petition in uni&s;on with almo&s;t the whole voice of the kingdom, (with who&s;e formal thanks I was covered over) whil&s;t I la|boured on no le&s;s than five bills for a public re|form, and fought, again&s;t the oppo&s;ition of great abilities, and of the greate&s;t power, every clau&s;e, and every word of the large&s;t of tho&s;e bills, al|mo&s;t to the very la&s;t day of a very long &s;e&s;&s;ion; all this time a canva&s;s in Bri&s;tol was as calmly
<PB N="10" REF="12">
carried on as if I were dead. I was con&s;idered as a man wholly out of the que&s;tion. Whil&s;t I watched, and fa&s;ted, and &s;weated in the Hou&s;e of Commons&mdash;by the mo&s;t ea&s;y and ordinary arts of election, by dinners and vi&s;its, by "How do you do's," and, "My worthy friends," I was to be quietly moved out of my &s;eat&mdash;and pro|mi&s;es were made, and engagements entered into, without any exception or re&s;erve, as if my labo|rious zeal in my duty had been a regular abdi|cation of my tru&s;t.</P>
<P>To open my whole heart to you on this &s;ub|ject, I do confe&s;s, however, that there were other times be&s;ides the two years in which I did vi&s;it you, when I was not wholly without lei&s;ure for repeating that mark of my re&s;pect. But I could not bring my mind to &s;ee you. You remem|ber, that in the beginning of this American war (that aera of calamity, di&s;grace and downfall, an aera which no feeling mind will ever mention with|out a tear for England) you were greatly divided; and a very &s;trong body, if not the &s;tronge&s;t, op|po&s;ed it&s;elf to the madne&s;s which every art and every power were employed to render popular, in order that the errors of the rulers might be lo&s;t in the general blindne&s;s of the nation. This oppo&s;ition continued until after our great, but mo&s;t unfortunate victory at Long I&s;land. Then all the mounds and banks of our con&s;tancy were borne down at once; and the phren&s;y of the American war broke in upon us like a deluge. This victory, which &s;eemed to put an immediate end to all difficulties, perfected us in that &s;pirit
<PB N="11" REF="13">
of domination, which our unparalleled pro&s;perity had but too long nurtured. We had been &s;o very powerful, and &s;o very pro&s;perous, that even the humble&s;t of us were degraded into the vices and follies of kings. We lo&s;t all mea&s;ure between means and ends; and our headlong de&s;ires be|came our politics and our morals. All men who wi&s;hed for peace, or retained any &s;entiments of moderation, were overborne or &s;ilenced; and this city was led by every artifice (and probably with the more management, becau&s;e I was one of your members) to di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf by its zeal for that fatal cau&s;e. In this temper of yours and of my mind, I &s;hould &s;ooner have fled to the ex|tremities of the earth, than have &s;hewn my&s;elf here. I, who &s;aw in every American victory (for you have had a long &s;eries of the&s;e misfortunes) the germ and &s;eed of the naval powers of France and Spain, which all our heat and warmth a|gain&s;t America was only hatching into life,&mdash;I &s;hould not have been a welcome vi&s;itant with the brow and the language of &s;uch feelings. When afterwards, the other face of your cala|mity was turned upon you, and &s;hewed it&s;elf in defeat and di&s;tre&s;s, I &s;hunned you full as much. I felt &s;orely this variety in our wretchedne&s;s; and I did not wi&s;h to have the lea&s;t appearance of in&s;ulting you with that &s;hew of &s;uperiority, which, though it may not be a&s;&s;umed, is gene|rally &s;u&s;pected in a time of calamity, from tho&s;e who&s;e previous warnings have been de&s;pi&s;ed. I
<PB N="12" REF="14">
could not bear to &s;hew you a repre&s;entative who&s;e face did not reflect that of his con&s;tituents; a face that could not joy in your joys, and &s;orrow in your &s;orrows. But time at length has made us all of one opinion; and we have all opened our eyes on the true nature of the American war, to the true nature of all its &s;ucce&s;&s;es and all its failures.</P>
<P>In that public &s;torm too I had my private feelings. I had &s;een blown down and pro&s;trate on the ground &s;everal of tho&s;e hou&s;es to whom I was chiefly indebted for the honour this city has done me. I confe&s;s, that whil&s;t the wounds of tho&s;e I loved were yet green, I could not bear to &s;hew my&s;elf in pride and triumph in that place into which their partiality had brought me, and to appear at fea&s;ts and rejoicings, in the mid&s;t of the grief and calamity of my warm friends, my zealous &s;upporters, my generous benefactors. This is a true, unvarni&s;hed, un|di&s;gui&s;ed &s;tate of the affair. You will judge of it.</P>
<P>This is the only one of the charges in which I am per&s;onally concerned. As to the other matters objected again&s;t me, which in their turn I &s;hall mention to you, remember once more I do not mean to extenuate or excu&s;e. Why &s;hould I, when the things charged are among tho&s;e upon which I found all my reputation? What would be left to me, if I my&s;elf was the man, who &s;oftened, and blended, and diluted, and weakened, all the di&s;tingui&s;hing colours of my life, &s;o as
<PB N="13" REF="15">
to leave nothing di&s;tinct and determinate in my whole conduct?</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, and it is the &s;econd charge, that in the que&s;tions of the Iri&s;h trade, I did not con&s;ult the intere&s;t of my con&s;tituents, or, to &s;peak out &s;trongly, that I rather acted as a na|tive of Ireland, than as an Engli&s;h member of parliament.</P>
<P>I certainly have very warm good wi&s;hes for the place of my birth. But the &s;phere of my duties is my true country. It was, as a man attached to your intere&s;ts, and zealous for the con&s;ervation of your power and dignity, that I acted on that occa&s;ion, and on all occa&s;ions. You were involved in the American war. A new world of policy was opened, to which it was nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould conform whether we would or not; and my only thought was how to con|form to our &s;ituation in &s;uch a manner as to unite to this kingdom, in pro&s;perity and in affection, whatever remained of the empire. I was true to my old, &s;tanding, invariable principle, that all things, which came from Great Britain, &s;hould i&s;&s;ue as a gift of her bounty and beneficence, ra|ther than as claims recovered again&s;t a &s;truggling litigant; or at lea&s;t, that if your beneficence ob|tained no credit in your conce&s;&s;ions, yet that they &s;hould appear the &s;alutary provi&s;ions of your wi&s;dom and fore&s;ight; not as things wrung from you with your blood, by the cruel gripe of a rigid nece&s;&s;ity. The fir&s;t conce&s;&s;ions, by being (much again&s;t my will) mangled and &s;tripped of
<PB N="14" REF="16">
the parts which were nece&s;&s;ary to make out their ju&s;t corre&s;pondence and connection in trade, were of no u&s;e. The next year a feeble attempt was made to bring the thing into better &s;hape. This attempt (countenanced by the mini&s;ter) on the very fir&s;t appearance of &s;ome popular unea&s;ine&s;s, was, after a con&s;iderable progre&s;s through the hou&s;e, thrown out by <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>What was the con&s;equence? The whole king|dom of Ireland was in&s;tantly in a flame. Threat|ened by foreigners, and, as they thought, in&s;ulted by England, they re&s;olved at once to re&s;i&s;t the power of France, and to ca&s;t off yours. As for us, we were able neither to protect nor to re&s;train them. Forty thou&s;and men were rai&s;ed and di&s;|ciplined without commi&s;&s;ion from the crown. Two illegal armies were &s;een with banners di&s;|played at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame coun|try. No executive magi&s;trate, no judicature, in Ireland, would acknowledge the legality of the army which bore the king's commi&s;&s;ion; and no law, or appearance of law, authori&s;ed the army commi&s;&s;ioned by it&s;elf. In this unexampled &s;tate of things, which the lea&s;t error, the lea&s;t tre&s;pa&s;s on the right or left, would have hurried down the precipice into an aby&s;s of blood and confu&s;ion, the people of Ireland demand a freedom of trade with arms in their hands. They interdict all com|merce between the two nations. They deny all new &s;upply in the Hou&s;e of Commons, although in time of war. They &s;tint the tru&s;t of the old revenue, given for two years to all the king's
<PB N="15" REF="17">
predece&s;&s;ors, to &s;ix months. The Briti&s;h Parliament, in a former &s;e&s;&s;ion frightened into a limited con|ce&s;&s;ion by the menaces of Ireland, frightened out of it by the menaces of England, was again frightened back again, and made an univer&s;al &s;urrender of all that had been thought the pe|culiar, re&s;erved, uncommunicable rights of Eng|land;&mdash;The exclu&s;ive commerce of America, of Africa, of the We&s;t-Indies&mdash;all the enumerations of the acts of navigation&mdash;all the manufactures,&mdash;iron, gla&s;s, even the la&s;t pledge of jealou&s;y and pride, the intere&s;t hid in the &s;ecret of our hearts, the inveterate prejudice moulded into the con&s;titution of our frame, even the &s;acred fleece it&s;elf, all went together. No re&s;erve; no ex|ception; no debate; no di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. A &s;udden light broke in upon us all. It broke in, not through well-contrived and well-di&s;po&s;ed win|dows, but through flaws and breaches; through the yawning cha&s;ms of our ruin. We were taught wi&s;dom by humiliation. No town in England pre&s;umed to have a prejudice; or dared to mutter a petition. What was wor&s;e, the whole Parlia|ment of England, which retained authority for no|thing but &s;urrenders, was de&s;poiled of every &s;ha|dow of its &s;uperintendance.

This &s;cene of &s;hame and di&s;grace, has, in a manner whil&s;t I am &s;peaking, ended by the perpetual e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a military power, in the dominions of this crown, without con&s;ent of the Briti&s;h

<P>What! Gentlemen, was I not to fore&s;ee, or fore&s;eeing, was I not to endeavour to &s;ave you from all the&s;e multiplied mi&s;chiefs and di&s;graces?

Was I an Iri&s;hman on that day, that I boldly with&s;tood our pride? or on the day that I hung down my head, and wept in &s;hame and &s;ilence over the humiliation of Great Britain? I became unpopular in England for the one, and in Ireland for the other. What then! What obligation lay on me to be popular? I was bound to &s;erve both kingdoms. To be plea&s;ed with my &s;ervice, was their affair, not mine.</P>
<P>I was an Iri&s;hman in the Iri&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s, ju&s;t as much as I was an American, when on the &s;ame

principles, I wi&s;hed you to concede to America, at a time when &s;he prayed conce&s;&s;ion at our feet. Ju&s;t as much was I an American when I wi&s;hed Parliament to offer terms in victory, and not to wait the well-cho&s;en hour of defeat, for making good by weakne&s;s, and by &s;upplication, a claim of prerogative, pre-eminence, and authority.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of requiring it from me, as a point of duty, to kindle with your pa&s;&s;ions, had you all been as cool as I was, you would have been &s;aved di&s;graces and di&s;tre&s;&s;es that are unutterable. Do you remember our commi&s;&s;ion? We &s;ent out a &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y acro&s;s the Atlantic ocean, to lay the Crown, the Peerage, the Commons of Great Britain, at the feet of the American Congre&s;s. That our di&s;grace might want no &s;ort of brighten|ing and burni&s;hing, ob&s;erve who they were that compo&s;ed this famous emba&s;&s;y. My Lord Car|li&s;le is among the fir&s;t ranks of our nobility. He is the identical man who but two years be|fore, had been put forward, at the opening of a &s;e&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of Lords, as the mover of an haughty and rigorous addre&s;s again&s;t America. He was put in the front of the emba&s;&s;y of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. Mr. Eden was taken from the of|fice of Lord Suffolk, to whom he was then un|der &s;ecretary of &s;tate; from the office of that Lord Suffolk, who but a few weeks before, in his place in parliament, did not deign to enquire where a Congre&s;s of vagrants was to be found. This Lord Suffolk &s;ent Mr. Eden to find the&s;e vagrants, without knowing where his King's
<PB N="18" REF="20">
Generals were to be found, who were joined in the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion of &s;upplicating tho&s;e whom they were &s;ent to &s;ubdue. They enter the capi|tal of America only to abandon it; and the&s;e a&s;&s;ertors and repre&s;entatives of the dignity of England, at the tail of a flying army, let fly their Parthian &s;hafts of memorials and remon|&s;trances at random behind them. Their pro|mi&s;es and their offers, their flatteries, their menaces, were all de&s;pi&s;ed; and we were &s;aved the di&s;grace of their formal reception, only becau&s;e the Congre&s;s &s;corned to receive them; whil&s;t the State-hou&s;e of independent Phila|delphia opened her doors to the public entry of the amba&s;&s;ador of France. From war and blood, we went to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and from &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion plunged back again to war and blood; to de&s;olate and be de&s;olated, without mea|&s;ure, hope, or end. I am a Royali&s;t, I blu&s;h|ed for this degradation of the Crown. I am a Whig, I blu&s;hed for the di&s;honour of Parlia|ment. I am a true Engli&s;hman, I felt to the quick for the di&s;grace of England. I am a Man, I felt for the melancholy rever&s;e of human af|fairs, in the fall of the fir&s;t power in the world.</P>
<P>To read what was approaching in Ireland, in the black and bloody characters of the Ameri|can war, was a painful, but it was a nece&s;&s;ary part of my public duty. For, Gentlemen, it is not your fond de&s;ires or mine that can alter the nature of things; by contending again&s;t which what have we got, or &s;hall ever get, but defeat
<PB N="19" REF="21">
and &s;hame? I did not obey your in&s;tructions: No. I conformed to the in&s;tructions of truth and nature, and maintained your intere&s;t, again&s;t your opinions, with a con&s;tancy that became me. A repre&s;entative worthy of you, ought to be a per|&s;on of &s;tability. I am to look, indeed, to your opinions; but to &s;uch opinions as you and I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have five years hence. I was not to look to the fla&s;h of the day. I knew that you cho&s;e me, in my place, along with others, to be a pillar of the &s;tate, and not a weathercock on the top of the edifice, exalted for my levity and ver|&s;atility, and of no u&s;e but to indicate the &s;hift|ings of every fa&s;hionable gale. Would to God, the value of my &s;entiments on Ireland and on America had been at this day a &s;ubject of doubt and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion! No matter what my &s;ufferings had been, &s;o that this kingdom had kept the authority I wi&s;hed it to maintain, by a grave fore&s;ight, and by an equitable temperance in the u&s;e of its power.</P>
<P>The next article of charge on my public conduct, and that which I find rather the mo&s;t prevalent of all, is Lord Beauchamp's bill. I mean his bill of la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion for reforming the law|proce&s;s concerning impri&s;onment. It is &s;aid, to aggravate the offence, that I treated the petition of this city with contempt even in pre&s;enting it to the Hou&s;e, and expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in terms of marked di&s;re&s;pect. Had this latter part of the charge been true, no merits on the &s;ide of the que&s;tion which I took, could po&s;&s;ibly excu&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="22">
me. But I am incapable of treating this city with di&s;re&s;pect. Very fortunately, at this minute (if my bad eye&s;ight does not deceive me) <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Williams.</NOTE>the worthy gentleman deputed on this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;tands directly before me. To him I appeal, whether I did not, though it militated with my olde&s;t and my mo&s;t recent public opinions, deliver the pe|tition with a &s;trong, and more than u&s;ual recom|mendation to the con&s;ideration of the Hou&s;e, on account of the character and con&s;equence of tho&s;e who &s;igned it. I believe the worthy gentleman will tell you, that the very day I received it, I applied to the Solicitor, now the Attorney Ge|neral, to give it an immediate con&s;ideration; and he mo&s;t obligingly and in&s;tantly con&s;ented to em|ploy a great deal of his very valuable time, to write an explanation of the bill. I attended the Committee with all po&s;&s;ible care and diligence, in order that every objection of yours might meet with a &s;olution; or produce an alteration. I en|treated your learned Recorder (always ready in bu&s;ine&s;s in which you take a concern) to attend. But what will you &s;ay to tho&s;e who blame me for &s;upporting Lord Beauchamp's bill, as a di&s;re|&s;pectful treatment of your petition, when you hear, that out of re&s;pect to you, I my&s;elf was the cau&s;e of the lo&s;s of that very bill? for the no|ble Lord who brought it in, and who, I mu&s;t &s;ay, has much merit for this and &s;ome other mea&s;ures, at my reque&s;t con&s;ented to put it off for a week, which the Speaker's illne&s;s lengthened to a fort|night; and then the frantic tumult about Popery,
<PB N="21" REF="23">
drove that and every rational bu&s;ine&s;s from the Hou&s;e. So that if I cho&s;e to make a de|fence of my&s;elf, on the little principles of a culprit pleading in his exculpation, I might not only &s;ecure my acquittal, but make merit with the oppo&s;ers of the bill. But I &s;hall do no &s;uch thing. The truth is, that I did occa&s;ion the lo&s;s of the bill, and by a delay cau&s;ed by my re&s;pect to you. But &s;uch an event was never in my contemplation. And I am &s;o far from taking credit for the defeat of that mea&s;ure, that I cannot &s;ufficiently lament my misfortune, if but one man, who ought to be at large, has pa&s;&s;ed a year in pri&s;on by my means. I am a debtor to the debtors. I confe&s;s judgment. I owe, what, if ever it be in my power, I &s;hall mo&s;t certainly pay,&mdash;ample atonement, and u&s;u|rious amends to liberty and humanity for my unhappy lap&s;e. For, Gentlemen, Lord Beau|champ's bill was a law of ju&s;tice and policy, as far as it went; I &s;ay as far as it went, for its fault was its being, in the remedial part, mi&s;era|bly defective.</P>
<P>There are two capital faults in our law with relation to civil debts. One is, that every man is pre&s;umed &s;olvent. A pre&s;umption, in innume|rable ca&s;es, directly again&s;t truth. Therefore the debtor is ordered, on a &s;uppo&s;ition of ability and fraud, to be coerced his liberty until he makes payment. By this means, in all ca&s;es of civil in|&s;olvency, without a pardon from his creditor, he is to be impri&s;oned for life:&mdash;and thus a
<PB N="22" REF="24">
mi&s;erable mi&s;taken invention of artificial &s;cience, operates to change a civil into a criminal judg|ment, and to &s;courge misfortune or indi&s;cretion with a puni&s;hment which the law does not in|flict on the greate&s;t crimes.</P>
<P>The next fault is, that the inflicting of that puni&s;hment is not on the opinion of an equal and public judge; but is referred to the arbitrary di&s;cretion of a private, nay intere&s;ted, and irri|tated, individual. He, who formally is, and &s;ub&s;tantially ought to be, the judge, is in rea|lity no more than mini&s;terial, a mere executive in&s;trument of a private man, who is at once judge and party. Every idea of judicial order is &s;ubverted by this procedure. If the in&s;olvency be no crime, why is it puni&s;hed with arbitrary impri&s;onment? If it be a crime, why is it deli|vered into private hands to pardon without di&s;|cretion, or to puni&s;h without mercy and with|out mea&s;ure?</P>
<P>To the&s;e faults, gro&s;s and cruel faults in our law, the excellent principle of Lord Beau|champ's bill applied &s;ome &s;ort of remedy. I know that credit mu&s;t be pre&s;erved; but equity mu&s;t be pre&s;erved too; and it is impo&s;&s;ible, that any thing &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to commerce, which is incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice. The principle of credit was not weakened by that bill. God forbid! The enforcement of that credit was only put into the &s;ame public judicial hands on which we depend for our lives, and all that makes life dear to us. But, indeed, this bu&s;ine&s;s was taken
<PB N="23" REF="25">
up too warmly both here and el&s;ewhere. The bill was extremely mi&s;taken. It was &s;uppo&s;ed to enact what it never enacted; and complaints were made of clau&s;es in it as novelties, which exi&s;ted before the noble Lord that brought in the bill was born. There was a fallacy that run through the whole of the objections. The gentlemen who oppo&s;ed the bill, always argued, as if the option lay between that bill and the antient law.&mdash;But this is a grand mi&s;take. For practically, the option is between, not that bill and the old law, but between that bill and tho&s;e occa&s;ional laws called acts of grace. For the operation of the old law is &s;o &s;avage, and &s;o inconvenient to &s;ociety, that for a long time pa&s;t, once in every parliament, and lately twice, the legi&s;lature has been obliged to make a general arbitrary jail-delivery, and at once to &s;et open, by its &s;overeign authority, all the pri&s;ons in England.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I never reli&s;hed acts of grace; nor ever &s;ubmitted to them but from de&s;pair of bet|ter. They are a di&s;honourable invention, by which, not from humanity, not from policy, but merely becau&s;e we have not room enough to hold the&s;e victims of the ab&s;urdity of our laws, we turn loo&s;e upon the public three or four thou&s;and naked wretches, corrupted by the habits, deba&s;ed by the ignominy of a pri&s;on. If the creditor had a right to tho&s;e carca&s;es as a na|tural &s;ecurity for his property, I am &s;ure we have no right to deprive him of that &s;ecurity.
<PB N="24" REF="26">
But if the few pounds of fle&s;h were not nece&s;|&s;ary to his &s;ecurity, we had not a right to detain the unfortunate debtor, without any benefit at all to the per&s;on who confined him.&mdash;Take it as you will, we commit inju&s;tice. Now Lord Beau|champ's bill intended to do deliberately, and with great caution and circum&s;pection, upon each &s;everal ca&s;e, and with all attention to the ju&s;t claimant, what acts of grace do in a much greater mea&s;ure, and with very little care, cau|tion, or deliberation.</P>
<P>I &s;u&s;pect that here too, if we contrive to op|po&s;e this bill, we &s;hall be found in a &s;truggle again&s;t the nature of things. For as we grow enlightened, the public will not bear, for any length of time, to pay for the maintenance of whole armies of pri&s;oners; nor, at their own ex|pence, &s;ubmit to keep jails as a &s;ort of garri&s;ons, merely to fortify the ab&s;urd principle of making men judges in their own cau&s;e. For credit has little or no concern in this cruelty. I &s;peak in a commercial a&s;&s;embly. You know, that credit is given, becau&s;e capital <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be employed; that men calculate the chances of in&s;olvency; and they either withhold the credit, or make the debtor pay the ri&s;que in the price. The count|ing-hou&s;e has no alliance with the jail. Hol|land under&s;tands trade as well as we, and &s;he has done much more than this obnoxious bill intended to do. There was not, when Mr. Howard vi&s;ited Holland, more than one pri&s;oner for debt in the great city of Rotterdam. Although
<PB N="25" REF="27">
Lord Beauchamp's act (which was previous to this bill, and intended to feel the way for it) has already pre&s;erved liberty to thou&s;ands; and though it is not three years &s;ince the la&s;t act of grace pa&s;&s;ed, yet by Mr. Howard's la&s;t account, there were near three thou&s;and again in jail. I cannot name this gentleman without re|marking, that his labours and writings have done much to open the eyes and hearts of mankind. He has vi&s;ited all Europe,&mdash;not to &s;urvey the &s;ump|tuou&s;ne&s;s of palaces, or the &s;tateline&s;s of temples; not to make accurate mea&s;urements of the re|mains of ancient grandeur, nor to form a &s;cale of the curio&s;ity of modern art; not to collect me|dals, or collate manu&s;cripts:&mdash;but to dive into the depths of dungeons; to plunge into the in|fection of ho&s;pitals; to &s;urvey the man&s;ions of &s;orrow and pain; to take the gage and dimen|&s;ions of mi&s;ery, depre&s;&s;ion, and contempt; to re|member the forgotten, to attend to the neglect|ed, to vi&s;it the for&s;aken, and to compare and col|late the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of all men in all countries. His plan is original; and it is as full of genius as it is of humanity. It was a voyage of di&s;covery; a circumnavigation of charity. Already the benefit of his labour is felt more or le&s;s in every country: I hope he will anticipate his final reward, by &s;eeing all its effects fully rea|lized in his own. He will receive, not by retail but in gro&s;s, the reward of tho&s;e who vi&s;it the pri|&s;oner; and he has &s;o fore&s;talled and monopolized this branch of charity, that there will be, I
<PB N="26" REF="28">
tru&s;t, little room to merit by &s;uch acts of be|nevolence hereafter.</P>
<P>Nothing remains now to trouble you with, but the fourth charge again&s;t me&mdash;the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the Roman Catholics. It is a bu&s;ine&s;s clo&s;ely connected with the re&s;t. They are all on one and the &s;ame principle. My little &s;cheme of conduct, &s;uch as it is, is all arranged. I could do nothing but what I have done on this &s;ub|ject, without confounding the whole train of my ideas, and di&s;turbing the whole order of my life. Gentlemen, I ought to apologize to you, for &s;eem|ing to think any thing at all nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid upon this matter. The calumny is fitter to be &s;crawled with the midnight chalk of incendiaries, with <Q REND="inline">"No Popery,"</Q> on walls and doors of devoted hou&s;es, than to be mentioned in any ci|vili&s;ed company. I had heard, that the &s;pirit of di&s;content on that &s;ubject was very prevalent here. With plea&s;ure I find that I have been gro&s;sly mi&s;informed. If it exi&s;ts at all in this city, the laws have cru&s;hed its exertions, and our morals have &s;hamed its appearance in day-light. I have pur&s;ued this &s;pirit where-ever I could trace it; but it &s;till fled from me. It was a gho&s;t, which all had heard of, but none had &s;een. None would acknowledge that he thought the public proceeding with regard to our Catho|lic di&s;&s;enters to be blameable; but &s;everal were &s;orry it had made an ill impre&s;&s;ion upon others, and that my intere&s;t was hurt by my &s;hare in the bu&s;ine&s;s. I find with &s;atisfaction and pride, that
<PB N="27" REF="29">
not above four or five in this city (and I dare &s;ay the&s;e mi&s;led by &s;ome gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation) have &s;igned that &s;ymbol of delu&s;ion and bond of &s;edition, that libel on the national religion and Engli&s;h character, the Prote&s;tant A&s;&s;ociation. It is therefore, Gentlemen, not by way of cure but of prevention, and le&s;t the arts of wicked men may prevail over the integrity of any one among&s;t us, that I think it nece&s;&s;ary to open to you the me|rits of this tran&s;action pretty much at large; and I beg your patience upon it: for, although the rea&s;onings that have been u&s;ed to depreciate the act are of little force, and though the authority of the men concerned in this ill de&s;ign is not very impo&s;ing; yet the audaciou&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e con&s;pi|rators again&s;t the national honour, and the ex|ten&s;ive wickedne&s;s of their attempts, have rai&s;ed per&s;ons of little importance to a degree of evil eminence, and imparted a &s;ort of &s;ini&s;ter dignity to proceedings that had their origin in only the meane&s;t and blinde&s;t malice.</P>
<P>In explaining to you the proceedings of Par|liament which have been complained of, I will &s;tate to you,&mdash;fir&s;t, the thing that was done;&mdash;next, the per&s;ons who did it;&mdash;and la&s;tly, the grounds and rea&s;ons upon which the legi&s;lature proceeded in this deliberate act of public ju&s;tice and public prudence.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, The condition of our nature is &s;uch, that we buy our ble&s;&s;ings at a price. The Reformation, one of the greate&s;t periods of hu|man improvement, was a time of trouble and
<PB N="28" REF="30">
confu&s;ion. The va&s;t &s;tructure of &s;uper&s;tition and tyranny, which had been for ages in rearing, and which was combined with the intere&s;t of the great and of the many; which was moulded into the laws, the manners, and civil in&s;titutions of nations, and blended with the frame and policy of &s;tates; could not be brought to the ground without a fearful &s;truggle; nor could it fall without a violent concu&s;&s;ion of it&s;elf and all about it. When this great revolution was attempted in a more regular mode by government, it was oppo&s;ed by plots and &s;editions of the people; when by popular efforts, it was repre&s;&s;ed as re|bellion by the hand of power; and bloody exe|cutions (often bloodily returned) marked the whole of its progre&s;s through all its &s;tages. The affairs of religion, which are no longer heard of in the tumult of our pre&s;ent contentions, made a principal ingredient in the wars and politics of that time; the enthu&s;ia&s;m of religion threw a gloom over the politics; and political intere&s;ts poi&s;oned and perverted the &s;pirit of religion upon all &s;ides. The Prote&s;tant religion in that vio|lent &s;truggle, infected, as the Popi&s;h had been before, by worldly intere&s;ts and worldly pa&s;&s;ions, became a per&s;ecutor in its turn, &s;ometimes of the new &s;ects, which carried their own principles further than it was convenient to the original reformers; and always of the body from whom they parted; and this per&s;ecuting &s;pirit aro&s;e, not only, from the bitterne&s;s of retaliation, but from the mercile&s;s policy of fear.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31">
It was long before the &s;pirit of true piety and true wi&s;dom, involved in the principles of the Reformation, could be depurated from the dregs and feculence of the contention with which it was carried through. However, until this be done, the Reformation is not complete; and tho&s;e who think them&s;elves good Prote&s;tants, from their animo&s;ity to others, are in that re&s;pect no Prote&s;tants at all. It was at fir&s;t thought nece&s;|&s;ary, perhaps, to oppo&s;e to Popery another Pope|ry, to get the better of it. Whatever was the cau&s;e, laws were made in many countries, and in this kingdom in particular, again&s;t Papi&s;ts, which are as bloody as any of tho&s;e which had been enacted by the Popi&s;h princes and &s;tates; and where tho&s;e laws were not bloody, in my opi|nion, they were wor&s;e; as they were &s;low, cruel outrages on our nature, and kept men alive only to in&s;ult in their per&s;ons, every one of the rights and feelings of humanity. I pa&s;s tho&s;e &s;tatutes, becau&s;e I would &s;pare your pious ears the repetition of &s;uch &s;hocking things; and I come to that parti|cular law, the repeal of which has produced &s;o many unnatural and unexpected con&s;equences.</P>
<P>A &s;tatute was fabricated in the year 1699, by which the &s;aying ma&s;s (a church-&s;ervice in the Latin tongue, not exactly the &s;ame as our Li|turgy, but very near it, and containing no of|fence what&s;oever again&s;t the laws, or again&s;t good morals) was forged into a crime puni&s;h|able with perpetual impri&s;onment. The teach|ing &s;chool, an u&s;eful and virtuous occupation,
<PB N="30" REF="32">
even the teaching in a private family, was in every Catholic &s;ubjected to the &s;ame unpropor|tioned puni&s;hment. Your indu&s;try, and the bread of your children, was taxed for a pecuni|ary reward to &s;timulate avarice to do what na|ture refu&s;ed, to inform and pro&s;ecute on this law. Every Roman Catholic was, under the &s;ame act, to forfeit his e&s;tate to his neare&s;t Pro|te&s;tant relation, until, through a profe&s;&s;ion of what he did not believe, he redeemed by his hy|pocri&s;y, what the law had transferred to the kin&s;man as the recompence of his profligacy. When thus turned out of doors from his pater|nal e&s;tate, he was di&s;abled from acquiring any other by any indu&s;try, donation, or charity; but was rendered a foreigner in his native land, only becau&s;e he retained the religion, along with the property, handed down to him from tho&s;e who had been the old inhabitants of that land before him.</P>
<P>Does any one who hears me approve this &s;cheme of things, or think there is common ju&s;tice, common &s;en&s;e, or common hone&s;ty in any part of it? If any does, let him &s;ay it, and I am ready to di&s;cu&s;s the point with temper and candour. But in&s;tead of approving, I per|ceive a virtuous indignation beginning to ri&s;e in your minds on the mere cold &s;tating of the &s;tatute.</P>
<P>But what will you feel, when you know from hi&s;tory how this &s;tatute pa&s;&s;ed, and what were the motives, and what the mode of making it? A party in this nation, enemies to the &s;y&s;tem of
<PB N="31" REF="33">
the Revolution, were in oppo&s;ition to the go|vernment of King William. They knew, that our glorious deliverer was an enemy to all per|&s;ecution. They knew that he came to free us from &s;lavery and Popery, out of a country, where a third of the people are contented Catho|lics under a Prote&s;tant government. He came with a part of his army compo&s;ed of tho&s;e very Catholics, to over&s;et the power of a Popi&s;h prince. Such is the effect of a tolerating &s;pirit; and &s;o much is liberty &s;erved in every way, and by all per&s;ons, by a manly adherence to its own principles. Whil&s;t freedom is true to it&s;elf, every thing becomes &s;ubject to it; and its very adver&s;aries are an in&s;trument in its hands.</P>
<P>The party I &s;peak of (like &s;ome among&s;t us who would di&s;parage the be&s;t friends of their coun|try) re&s;olved to make the King either violate his principles of toleration, or incur the odium of protecting Papi&s;ts. They therefore brought in this bill, and made it purpo&s;ely wicked and ab|&s;urd that it might be rejected. The then court|party, di&s;covering their game, turned the tables on them, and returned their bill to them &s;tuffed with &s;till greater ab&s;urdities, that its lo&s;s might lie upon its original authors. They, finding their own ball thrown back to them, kicked it back again to their adver&s;aries. And thus this act, loaded with the double inju&s;tice of two parties, neither of whom intended to pa&s;s, what they hoped the other would be per&s;uaded to reject,
<PB N="32" REF="34">
went through the legi&s;lature, contrary to the real wi&s;h of all parts of it, and of all the parties that compo&s;ed it. In this manner the&s;e in&s;olent and profligate factions, as if they were playing with balls and counters, made a &s;port of the fortunes and the liberties of their fellow-crea|tures. Other acts of per&s;ecution have been acts of malice. This was a &s;ubver&s;ion of ju&s;tice from wantonne&s;s and petulance. Look into the hi&s;|tory of Bi&s;hop Burnet. He is a witne&s;s without exception.</P>
<P>The effects of the act have been as mi&s;chievous, as its origin was ludicrous and &s;hameful. From that time every per&s;on of that communion, lay and eccle&s;ia&s;tic, has been obliged to fly from the face of day. The clergy, concealed in garrets of private hou&s;es, or obliged to take a &s;helter (hardly &s;afe to them&s;elves, but infinitely dangerous to their country) under the privileges of foreign mini&s;ters, officiated as their &s;ervants, and under their protection. The whole body of the Catholics, condemned to beggary and to ignorance in their native land, have been obliged to learn the prin|ciples of letters, at the hazard of all their other principles, from the charity of your enemies. They have been taxed to their ruin at the plea|&s;ure of nece&s;&s;itous and profligate relations, and ac|cording to the mea&s;ure of their nece&s;&s;ity and pro|fligacy. Examples of this are many and affecting. Some of them are known by a friend who &s;tands near me in this hall. It is but &s;ix or &s;even years &s;ince a clergyman of the name of Malony, a
<PB N="33" REF="35">
man of morals, neither guilty nor accu&s;ed of any thing noxious to the &s;tate, was condemned to perpetual impri&s;onment for exerci&s;ing the func|tions of his religion; and after lying in jail two or three years, was relieved by the mercy of go|vernment from perpetual impri&s;onment, on con|dition of perpetual bani&s;hment. A brother of the Earl of Shrew&s;bury, a Talbot, a name re|&s;pectable in this county, whil&s;t its glory is any part of its concern, was hauled to the bar of the Old Bailey among common felons, and only e&s;caped the &s;ame doom, either by &s;ome error in the proce&s;s, or that the wretch who brought him there could not correctly de&s;cribe his per&s;on; I now forget which.&mdash;In &s;hort, the per&s;ecution would never have relented for a moment, if the judges, &s;uper&s;eding (though with an ambiguous example) the &s;trict rule of their artificial duty by the higher obligation of their con&s;cience, did not con&s;tantly throw every difficulty in the way of &s;uch informers. But &s;o ineffectual is the power of legal eva&s;ion again&s;t legal iniquity, that it was but the other day, that a lady of condition, beyond the middle of life, was on the point of being &s;tripped of her whole fortune by a near relation, to whom &s;he had been a friend and be|nefactor: and &s;he mu&s;t have been totally ruined, without a power of redre&s;s or mitigation from the courts of law, had not the legi&s;lature it&s;elf ru&s;hed in, and by a &s;pecial act of Parliament re&s;cued her from the inju&s;tice of its own &s;ta|tutes. One of the acts authori&s;ing &s;uch things
<PB N="34" REF="36">
was that which we in part repealed, knowing what our duty was; and doing that duty as men of honour and virtue, as good Prote&s;tants, and as good citizens. Let him &s;tand forth that di&s;|approves what we have done!</P>
<P>Gentlemen, Bad laws are the wor&s;t &s;ort of ty|ranny. In &s;uch a country as this, they are of all bad things the wor&s;t, wor&s;e by far than any where el&s;e; and they derive a particular malig|nity even from the wi&s;dom and &s;oundne&s;s of the re&s;t of our in&s;titutions. For very obvious rea|&s;ons you cannot tru&s;t the Crown with a di&s;pen&s;|ing power over any of your laws. However, a government, be it as bad as it may, will, in the exerci&s;e of a di&s;cretionary power, di&s;criminate times and per&s;ons; and will not ordinarily pur&s;ue any man, when its own &s;afety is not concerned. A mercenary informer knows no di&s;tinction. Un|der &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, the obnoxious people are &s;laves, not only to the government, but they live at the mercy of every individual; they are at once the &s;laves of the whole community, and of every part of it; and the wor&s;t and mo&s;t unmerciful men are tho&s;e on who&s;e goodne&s;s they mo&s;t depend.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation men not only &s;hrink from the frowns of a &s;tern magi&s;trate; but they are obliged to fly from their very &s;pecies. The &s;eeds of de&s;truction are &s;own in civil intercour&s;e, in &s;ocial habitudes. The blood of whole&s;ome kindred is infected. Their tables and beds are &s;urrounded with &s;nares. All the means given by Providence to make life &s;afe and comfortable,
<PB N="35" REF="37">
are perverted into in&s;truments of terror and tor|ment. This &s;pecies of univer&s;al &s;ub&s;erviency, that makes the very &s;ervant who waits behind your chair, the arbiter of your life and fortune, has &s;uch a tendency to degrade and deba&s;e man|kind, and to deprive them of that a&s;&s;ured and liberal &s;tate of mind, which alone can make us what we ought to be, that I vow to God I would &s;ooner bring my&s;elf to put a man to immediate death for opinions I di&s;liked, and &s;o to get rid of the man and his opinions at once, than to fret him with a feveri&s;h being, tainted with the jail-di&s;temper of a contagious &s;ervitude, to keep him above ground, an animated ma&s;s of putre|faction, corrupted him&s;elf, and corrupting all about him.</P>
<P>The act repealed was of this direct tendency; and it was made in the manner which I have re|lated to you. I will now tell you by whom the bill of repeal was brought into Parliament. I find it has been indu&s;triou&s;ly given out in this city (from kindne&s;s to me unque&s;tionably) that I was the mover or the &s;econder. The fact is, I did not once open my lips on the &s;ubject dur|ing the whole progre&s;s of the bill. I do not &s;ay this as di&s;claiming my &s;hare in that mea&s;ure. Very far from it. I inform you of this fact, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;eem to arrogate to my&s;elf the merits which belong to others. To have been the man cho&s;en out to redeem our fellow-citizens from &s;lavery; to purify our laws from ab&s;urdity and inju&s;tice; and to clean&s;e our religion from the
<PB N="36" REF="38">
blot and &s;tain of per&s;ecution, would be an ho|nour and happine&s;s to which my wi&s;hes would undoubtedly a&s;pire; but to which nothing but my wi&s;hes could po&s;&s;ibly have entitled me. That great work was in hands in every re&s;pect far bet|ter qualified than mine. The mover of the bill was Sir George Savile.</P>
<P>When an act of great and &s;ignal humanity was to be done, and done with all the weight and autho|rity that belonged to it, the world could ca&s;t its eyes upon none but him. I hope that few things, which have a tendency to ble&s;s or to adorn life, have wholly e&s;caped my ob&s;ervation in my pa&s;&s;age through it. I have &s;ought the acquaintance of that gentleman, and have &s;een him in all &s;itu|ations. He is a true genius; with an under|&s;tanding vigorous, and acute, and refined, and di&s;tingui&s;hing even to exce&s;s; and illuminated with a mo&s;t unbounded, peculiar, and original ca&s;t of imagination. With the&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many external and in&s;trumental advantages; and he makes u&s;e of them all. His fortune is among the large&s;t; a fortune which, wholly unincum|bred, as it is, with one &s;ingle charge from lux|ury, vanity, or exce&s;s, &s;inks under the benevo|lence of its di&s;pen&s;er. This private benevolence, expanding it&s;elf into patrioti&s;m, renders his whole being the e&s;tate of the public, in which he has not re&s;erved a <HI>peculium</HI> for him&s;elf of profit, diver&s;ion, or relaxation. During the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the fir&s;t in, and the la&s;t out of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons; he pa&s;&s;es from the &s;enate to the camp;
<PB N="37" REF="39">
and, &s;eldom &s;eeing the &s;eat of his ance&s;tors, he is always in Parliament to &s;erve his country, or in the field to defend it. But in all well-wrought compo&s;itions, &s;ome particulars &s;tand out more eminently than the re&s;t; and the things which will carry his name to po&s;terity, are his two bills; I mean that for a limitation of the claims of the crown upon landed e&s;tates; and this for the relief of the Roman Catholics. By the former, he has emancipated property; by the latter, he has quieted con&s;cience; and by both, he has taught that grand le&s;&s;on to government and &s;ub|ject,&mdash;no longer to regard each other as adver&s;e parties.</P>
<P>Such was the mover of the act that is com|plained of by men, who are not quite &s;o good as he is; an act, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly not brought in by him from any partiality to that &s;ect which is the object of it. For, among his faults, I really cannot help reckoning a greater degree of pre|judice again&s;t that people, than becomes &s;o wi&s;e a man. I know that he inclines to a &s;ort of di&s;gu&s;t, mixed with a con&s;iderable degree of a&s;perity, to the &s;y&s;tem; and he has few, or rather no habits with any of its profe&s;&s;ors. What he has done was on quite other motives. The motives were the&s;e, which he declared in his excellent &s;peech on his motion for the bill; namely, his extreme zeal to the Prote&s;tant religion, which he thought utterly di&s;graced by the act of 1699; and his rooted hatred to all kind of oppre&s;&s;ion, under any colour or upon any pretence what&s;oever.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="40">
The &s;econder was worthy of the mover, and the motion. I was not the &s;econder; it was Mr. Dunning, Recorder of this city. I &s;hall &s;ay the le&s;s of him, becau&s;e his near relation to you makes you more particularly acquainted with his merits. But I &s;hould appear little acquainted with them, or little &s;en&s;ible of them, if I could utter his name on this occa&s;ion without expre&s;|&s;ing my e&s;teem for his character. I am not afraid of offending a mo&s;t learned body, and mo&s;t jealous of its reputation for that learning, when I &s;ay he is the fir&s;t of his profe&s;&s;ion. It is a point &s;ettled by tho&s;e who &s;ettle every thing el&s;e; and I mu&s;t add (what I am enabled to &s;ay from my own long and clo&s;e ob&s;ervation) that there is not a man, of any profe&s;&s;ion, or in any &s;itu|ation, of a more erect and independent &s;pirit; of a more proud honour; a more manly mind; a more firm and determined integrity. A&s;&s;ure your&s;elves, that the names of two &s;uch men will bear a great load of prejudice in the other &s;cale, before they can be entirely outweighed.</P>
<P>With this mover, and this &s;econder, agreed the <HI>whole</HI> Hou&s;e of Commons; the <HI>whole</HI> Hou&s;e of Lords; the <HI>whole</HI> Bench of Bi&s;hops; the King; the Mini&s;try; the Oppo&s;ition; all the di&s;tingui&s;hed Clergy of the E&s;tabli&s;hment; all the eminent lights (for they were con&s;ulted) of the Di&s;&s;ent|ing churches. This according voice of national wi&s;dom ought to be li&s;tened to with reverence. To &s;ay that all the&s;e de&s;criptions of Engli&s;h|men unanimou&s;ly concurred in a &s;cheme for
<PB N="39" REF="41">
introducing the Catholic religion, or that none of them under&s;tood the nature and effects of what they were doing, &s;o well as a few ob&s;cure clubs of people, who&s;e names you never heard of, is &s;hamele&s;sly ab&s;urd. Surely it is paying a mi&s;erable compliment to the religion we pro|fe&s;s, to &s;ugge&s;t, that every thing eminent in the kingdom is indifferent, or even adver&s;e to that religion, and that its &s;ecurity is wholly aban|doned to the zeal of tho&s;e, who have nothing but their zeal to di&s;tingui&s;h them. In weighing this unanimous concurrence of whatever the nation has to boa&s;t of, I hope you will recollect, that all the&s;e concurring parties do by no means love one another enough to agree in any point, which was not both evidently, and importantly, right.</P>
<P>To prove this; to prove, that the mea&s;ure was both clearly and materially proper, I will next lay before you (as I promi&s;ed) the political grounds and rea&s;ons for the repeal of that pe|nal &s;tatute; and the motives to its repeal at that particular time.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, America&mdash;When the Engli&s;h nation &s;eemed to be dangerou&s;ly, if not irreco|verably divided; when one, and that the mo&s;t growing branch, was torn from the parent &s;tock, and engrafted on the power of France, a great terror fell upon this kingdom. On a &s;udden we awakened from our dreams of conque&s;t, and &s;aw our&s;elves threatened with an immediate inva&s;ion; which we were, at that time, very ill prepared to re&s;i&s;t. You remember the cloud that gloomed
<PB N="40" REF="42">
over us all. In that hour of our di&s;may, from the bottom of the hiding-places, into which the indi&s;criminate rigour of our &s;tatutes had driven them, came out the body of the Roman Catho|lics. They appeared before the &s;teps of a tot|tering throne, with one of the mo&s;t &s;ober, mea|&s;ured, &s;teady, and dutiful addre&s;&s;es, that was ever pre&s;ented to the crown. It was no holiday cere|mony; no anniver&s;ary compliment of parade and &s;how. It was &s;igned by almo&s;t every gentleman of that per&s;ua&s;ion, of note or property, in Eng|land. At &s;uch a cri&s;is, nothing but a decided re&s;olution to &s;tand or fall with their country could have dictated &s;uch an addre&s;s; the direct tendency of which was to cut off all retreat; and to render them peculiarly obnoxious to an in|vader of their own communion. The addre&s;s &s;hewed, what I long langui&s;hed to &s;ee, that all the &s;ubjects of England had ca&s;t off all foreign views and connexions, and that every man looked for his relief from every grievance, at the hands only of his own natural government.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary, on our part, that the natu|ral government &s;hould &s;hew it&s;elf worthy of that name. It was nece&s;&s;ary, at the cri&s;is I &s;peak of, that the &s;upreme power of the &s;tate &s;hould meet the conciliatory di&s;po&s;itions of the &s;ubject. To delay protection would be to reject allegiance. And why &s;hould it be rejected, or even coldly and &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly received? If any independent Catholic &s;tate &s;hould choo&s;e to take part with this kingdom in a war with France and Spain, that bigot (if &s;uch a bigot could be found)
<PB N="41" REF="43">
would be heard with little re&s;pect, who could dream of objecting his religion to an ally, whom the nation would not only receive with its free&s;t thanks, but purcha&s;e, with the la&s;t remains of its exhau&s;ted trea&s;ure. To &s;uch an ally we &s;hould not dare to whi&s;per a &s;ingle &s;yllable of tho&s;e ba&s;e and invidious topics, upon which, &s;ome un|happy men would per&s;uade the &s;tate, to reject the duty and allegiance of its own members. Is it then, becau&s;e foreigners are in a condition to &s;et our malice at defiance, that with <HI>them,</HI> we are willing to contract engagements of friend&s;hip, and to keep them with fidelity and honour; but that, becau&s;e we conceive, &s;ome de&s;criptions of our countrymen are not powerful enough to puni&s;h our malignity, we will not permit them to &s;upport our common intere&s;t? Is it on that ground, that our anger is to be kindled by their offered kindne&s;s, and that they are to be &s;ubjected to penalties, becau&s;e they are willing, by actual merit, to purge them&s;elves from im|puted crimes? Le&s;t by an adherence to the cau&s;e of their country they &s;hould acquire a title to fair and equitable treatment, are we re&s;olved to furni&s;h them with cau&s;es of eternal enmity; and rather &s;upply them with ju&s;t and founded motives to di&s;affection, than not to have that di&s;affection in exi&s;tence to ju&s;tify an oppre&s;&s;ion, which, not from policy but di&s;po&s;ition, we have determined to exerci&s;e?</P>
<P>What &s;hadow of rea&s;on could be a&s;&s;igned, why, at a time, when the mo&s;t Prote&s;tant part of
<PB N="42" REF="44">
this Prote&s;tant empire found it for its advantage to unite with the two principal Popi&s;h &s;tates, to unite it&s;elf in the clo&s;e&s;t bonds with France and Spain, for our de&s;truction, that we &s;hould refu&s;e to unite with our own Catholic countrymen for our own pre&s;ervation? Ought we, like madmen, to tear off the plai&s;ters, that the lenient hand of prudence had &s;pread over the wounds and ga&s;hes, which in our delirium of ambition we had given to our own body? No per&s;on ever reprobated the American war more than I did, and do, and ever &s;hall. But I never will con&s;ent that we &s;hould lay additional voluntary penalties on our|&s;elves, for a fault which carries but too much of its own puni&s;hment in its own nature. For one, I was delighted with the propo&s;al of internal peace. I accepted the ble&s;&s;ing with thankfulne&s;s and tran&s;port; I was truly happy, to find <HI>one</HI> good effect of our civil di&s;tractions, that they had put an end to all religious &s;trife and heart-burning in our own bowels. What mu&s;t be the &s;entiments of a man, who could wi&s;h to perpetuate dome&s;tic ho&s;tility, when the cau&s;es of di&s;pute are at an end; and who, crying out for peace with one part of the nation on the mo&s;t humiliating terms, &s;hould deny it to tho&s;e, who offer friend&s;hip without any terms at all?</P>
<P>But if I was unable to reconcile &s;uch a de|nial to the contracted principles of local duty, what an&s;wer could I give to the broad claims of general humanity? I confe&s;s to you freely, that the &s;ufferings and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the people of
<PB N="43" REF="45">
America in this cruel war, have at times af|fected me more deeply than I can expre&s;s. I felt every Gazette of triumph as a blow upon my heart, which has an hundred times &s;unk and fainted within me at all the mi&s;chiefs brought upon tho&s;e who bear the whole brunt of war in the heart of their country. Yet the Americans are utter &s;trangers to me; a nation, among whom I am not &s;ure, that I have a &s;ingle acquaint|ance. Was I to &s;uffer my mind to be &s;o unac|countably warped; was I to keep &s;uch iniquitous weights and mea&s;ures of temper and of rea&s;on, as to &s;ympathi&s;e with tho&s;e who are in open rebellion again&s;t an authority which I re&s;pect, at war with a country which by every title ought to be, and is mo&s;t dear to me; and yet to have no feeling at all for the hard&s;hips and indigni|ties &s;uffered by men, who, by their very vicinity, are bound up in a nearer relation to us; who contribute their &s;hare, and more than their &s;hare, to the common pro&s;perity; who perform the common offices of &s;ocial life, and who obey the laws to the full as well as I do? Gentlemen, the danger to the &s;tate being out of the que&s;tion (of which, let me tell you, &s;tate&s;men them&s;elves are apt to have but too exqui&s;ite a &s;en&s;e) I could a&s;|&s;ign no one rea&s;on of ju&s;tice, policy, or feeling, for not concurring mo&s;t cordially, as mo&s;t cor|dially I did concur, in &s;oftening &s;ome part of that &s;hameful &s;ervitude, under which &s;everal of my worthy fellow-citizens were groaning.</P>
<P>Important effects followed this act of wi&s;dom. They appeared at home and abroad, to the great
<PB N="44" REF="46">
benefit of this kingdom; and, let me hope, to the advantage of mankind at large. It be|tokened union among our&s;elves. It &s;hewed &s;oundne&s;s, even on the part of the per&s;ecuted, which generally is the weak &s;ide of every com|munity. But its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential operation was not in England. The act was immediately, though very imperfectly, copied in Ireland; and this im|perfect tran&s;cript of an imperfect act, this fir&s;t faint &s;ketch of toleration, which did little more than di&s;clo&s;e a principle, and mark out a di&s;po|&s;ition, completed in a mo&s;t wonderful manner the re-union to the &s;tate, of all the Catholics of that country. It made us, what we ought always to have been, one family, one body, one heart and &s;oul, again&s;t the family-combination, and all other combinations of our enemies. We have indeed obligations to that people, who received &s;uch &s;mall benefits with &s;o much gra|titude; and for which gratitude and attachment to us, I am afraid they have &s;uffered not a little in other places.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay, you have all heard of the privi|leges indulged to the Iri&s;h Catholics re&s;iding in Spain. You have likewi&s;e heard with what cir|cum&s;tances of &s;everity they have been lately ex|pelled from the &s;ea-ports of that kingdom; driven into the inland cities; and there detained as a &s;ort of pri&s;oners of &s;tate. I have good rea&s;on to believe, that it was the zeal to our go|vernment and our cau&s;e, (&s;omewhat indi&s;creetly expre&s;&s;ed in one of the addre&s;&s;es of the Catholics of Ireland) which has thus drawn down on
<PB N="45" REF="47">
their heads the indignation of the Court of Madrid; to the inexpre&s;&s;ible lo&s;s of &s;everal in|dividuals, and in future, perhaps, to the great detriment of the whole of their body. Now that our people &s;hould be per&s;ecuted in Spain for their attachment to this country, and per&s;ecuted in this country for their &s;uppo&s;ed enmity to us, is &s;uch a jarring reconciliation of contradictory di&s;tre&s;&s;es, is a thing at once &s;o dreadful and ridi|culous, that no malice &s;hort of diabolical, would wi&s;h to continue any human creatures in &s;uch a &s;ituation. But hone&s;t men will not forget either their merit or their &s;ufferings. There are men, (and many, I tru&s;t, there are) who, out of love to their country and their kind, would tor|ture their invention to find excu&s;es for the mi&s;|takes of their brethren; and who, to &s;tifle di&s;&s;en|&s;ion, would con&s;true, even doubtful appearances, with the utmo&s;t favour: &s;uch men will never per|&s;uade them&s;elves to be ingenious and refined in di&s;covering di&s;affection and trea&s;on in the ma|nife&s;t palpable &s;igns of &s;uffering loyalty. Per|&s;ecution is &s;o unnatural to them, that they gladly &s;natch the very fir&s;t opportunity of lay|ing a&s;ide all the tricks and devices of penal po|litics; and of returning home, after all their irk|&s;ome and vexatious wanderings, to our natural family man&s;ion, to the grand &s;ocial principle, that unites all men, in all de&s;criptions, under the &s;hadow of an equal and impartial ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Men of another &s;ort, I mean the bigotted ene|mies to liberty, may, perhaps, in their politics, make no account of the good or ill affection of
<PB N="46" REF="48">
the Catholics of England, who are but an hand|ful of people (enough to torment, but not enough to fear) perhaps not &s;o many, of both &s;exes and of all ages, as fifty thou&s;and. But, Gentlemen, it is po&s;&s;ible you may not know, that the people of that per&s;ua&s;ion in Ireland, amount at lea&s;t to &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls. I do not at all exaggerate the number. A <HI>nation</HI> to be per&s;ecuted! Whil&s;t we were ma&s;|ters of the &s;ea, embodied with America, and in alliance with half the powers of the continent, we might perhaps, in that remote corner of Eu|rope, afford to tyranni&s;e with impunity. But there is a revolution in our affairs, which makes it prudent to be ju&s;t. In our late awkward con|te&s;t with Ireland about trade, had religion been thrown in, to ferment and embitter the ma&s;s of di&s;contents, the con&s;equences might have been truly dreadful. But very happily, that cau&s;e of quarrel was previou&s;ly quieted by the wi&s;dom of the acts I am commending.</P>
<P>Even in England, where I admit the danger from the di&s;content of that per&s;ua&s;ion to be le&s;s than in Ireland; yet even here, had we li&s;tened to the coun&s;els of Fanatici&s;m and Folly, we might have wounded our&s;elves very deeply; and wounded our&s;elves in a very tender part. You are appri&s;ed, that the Catholics of England con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of your be&s;t manufacturers. Had the legi&s;lature cho&s;en, in&s;tead of returning their declarations of duty with corre&s;pondent good-will, to drive them to de&s;pair, there is a country at their very door,
<PB N="47" REF="49">
to which they would be invited; a country in all re&s;pects as good as ours, and with the fine&s;t cities in the world ready built to receive them. And thus the bigotry of a free country, and in an enlightened age, would have repeopled the cities of Flanders, which, in the darkne&s;s of two hun|dred years ago, had been de&s;olated by the &s;u|per&s;tition of a cruel tyrant. Our manufactures were the growth of the per&s;ecutions in the Low Countries. What a &s;pectacle would it be to Eu|rope, to &s;ee us at this time of day, balancing the account of tyranny with tho&s;e very countries, and by our per&s;ecutions, driving back Trade and Manufacture, as a &s;ort of vagabonds, to their original &s;ettlement! But I tru&s;t we &s;hall be &s;aved this la&s;t of di&s;graces.</P>
<P>So far as to the effect of the act on the intere&s;ts of this nation. With regard to the intere&s;ts of mankind at large, I am &s;ure the benefit was very con&s;iderable. Long before this act, indeed, the &s;pi|rit of toleration began to gain ground in Europe. In Holland, the third part of the people are Catholics; they live at ea&s;e; and are a &s;ound part of the &s;tate. In many parts of Germany, Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts partake the &s;ame cities, the &s;ame councils, and even the &s;ame churches. The unbounded liberality of the king of Pru&s;|&s;ia's conduct on this occa&s;ion is known to all the world; and it is of a piece with the other grand maxims of his reign. The magnanimity of the Imperial Court, breaking through the narrow principles of its predece&s;&s;ors, has indulged its
<PB N="48" REF="50">
Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, not only with property, with wor&s;hip, with liberal education; but with honours and tru&s;ts, both civil and military. A worthy Pro|te&s;tant gentleman of this country now fills, and fills with credit, an high office in the Au&s;trian Netherlands. Even the Lutheran ob&s;tinacy of Sweden has thawed at length, and opened a toleration to all religions. I know my&s;elf, that in France the Prote&s;tants begin to be at re&s;t. The army, which in that country is every thing, is open to them; and &s;ome of the mili|tary rewards and decorations which the laws deny, are &s;upplied by others, to make the &s;er|vice acceptable and honourable. The fir&s;t mi|ni&s;ter of finance in that country, is a Prote&s;tant. Two years war without a tax, is among the fir&s;t|fruits of their liberality. Tarni&s;hed as the glory of this nation is, and far as it has waded into the &s;hades of an eclip&s;e, &s;ome beams of its former illu|mination &s;till play upon its &s;urface; and what is done in England is &s;till looked to, as argument, and as example. It is certainly true, that no law of this country ever met with &s;uch univer&s;al ap|plau&s;e abroad, or was &s;o likely to produce the perfection of that tolerating &s;pirit, which, as I ob|&s;erved, has been long gaining ground in Europe; for abroad, it was univer&s;ally thought that we had done, what, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, we had not; they thought we had granted a full toleration. That opi|nion was however &s;o far from hurting the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e, that I declare, with the mo&s;t &s;erious &s;olemni|ty, my firm belief, that no one thing done for the&s;e
<PB N="49" REF="51">
fifty years pa&s;t, was &s;o likely to prove deeply bene|ficial to our religion at large as Sir George Savile's act. In its effects it was, <Q REND="inline">"an act for tolerating and protecting Prote&s;tanti&s;m throughout Eu|rope:"</Q> and I hope, that tho&s;e who were taking &s;teps for the quiet and &s;ettlement of our Prote&s;tant brethren in other countries, will even yet, rather con&s;ider the &s;teady equity of the greater and bet|ter part of the people of Great Britain, than the vanity and violence of a few.</P>
<P>I perceive, Gentlemen, by the manner of all about me, that you look with horror on the wicked clamour which has been rai&s;ed on this &s;ubject; and that in&s;tead of an apology for what was done, you rather demand from me an ac|count, why the execution of the &s;cheme of to|leration, was not made more an&s;werable to the large and liberal grounds on which it was taken up. The que&s;tion is natural and proper; and I remember that a great and learned magi&s;trate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Chancellour.</NOTE>, di&s;tingui&s;hed for his &s;trong and &s;y&s;tematic un|der&s;tanding, and who at that time was a mem|ber of the Hou&s;e of Commons, made the &s;ame objection to the proceeding. The &s;tatutes, as they now &s;tand, are, without doubt, perfectly ab&s;urd. But I beg leave to explain the cau&s;e of this gro&s;s imperfection, in the tolerating plan, as well and as &s;hortly as I am able. It was uni|ver&s;ally thought, that the &s;e&s;&s;ion ought not to pa&s;s over without doing <HI>&s;omething</HI> in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s. To revi&s;e the whole body of the penal
<PB N="50" REF="52">
&s;tatutes was conceived to be an object too big for the time. The penal &s;tatute therefore which was cho&s;en for repeal (cho&s;en to &s;hew our di&s;po&s;ition to conciliate, not to perfect a toleration) was this act of ludicrous cruelty, of which I have ju&s;t given you the hi&s;tory. It is an act, which, though not by a great deal &s;o fierce and bloody as &s;ome of the re&s;t, was infinitely more ready in the execution. It was the act which gave the greate&s;t encourage|ment to tho&s;e pe&s;ts of &s;ociety, mercenary infor|mers, and intere&s;ted di&s;turbers of hou&s;hold peace; and it was ob&s;erved with truth, that the pro&s;ecu|tions, either carried to conviction or compounded, for many years, had been all commenced upon that act. It was &s;aid, that whil&s;t we were deliberating on a more perfect &s;cheme, the &s;pirit of the age would never come up to the execution of the &s;tatutes which remained; e&s;pecially as more &s;teps, and a co-operation of more minds and powers, were required towards a mi&s;chievous u&s;e of them, than for the execution of the act to be repealed: that it was better to unravel this texture from be|low than from above, beginning with the late&s;t, which, in general practice, is the &s;evere&s;t evil. It was alledged, that this &s;low proceeding would be attended with the advantage of a progre&s;&s;ive expe|rience; and that the people would grow reconciled to toleration, when they &s;hould find by the effects, that ju&s;tice was not &s;o irreconcileable an enemy to convenience as they had imagined.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Gentlemen, were the rea&s;ons why we left this good work in the rude unfini&s;hed &s;tate, in
<PB N="51" REF="53">
which good works are commonly left, through the tame circum&s;pection with which a timid prudence &s;o frequently enervates beneficence. In doing good, we are generally cold, and languid, and &s;luggi&s;h; and of all things afraid of being too much in the right. But the works of malice and inju&s;tice are quite in another &s;tyle. They are fini&s;hed with a bold ma&s;terly hand; touched as they are with the &s;pirit of tho&s;e vehement pa&s;&s;ions that call forth all our energies whenever we op|pre&s;s and per&s;ecute.</P>
<P>Thus this matter was left for the time, with a full determination in Parliament, not to &s;uffer other and wor&s;e &s;tatutes to remain for the purpo&s;e of counteracting the benefits propo&s;ed by the re|peal of one penal law; for nobody then dreamed of defending what was done as a benefit, on the ground of its being no benefit at all. We were not then ripe for &s;o mean a &s;ubterfuge.</P>
<P>I do not wi&s;h to go over the horrid &s;cene that was afterwards acted. Would to God it could be expunged for ever from the annals of this coun|try! But &s;ince it mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t for our &s;hame, let it &s;ub&s;i&s;t for our in&s;truction. In the year 1780 there were found in this nation men deluded enough (for I give the whole to their delu&s;ion) on pre|tences of zeal and piety, without any &s;ort of pro|vocation what&s;oever, real or pretended, to make a de&s;perate attempt, which would have con&s;umed all the glory and power of this country in the flames of London; and buried all law, order, and re|ligion, under the ruins of the metropolis of the
<PB N="52" REF="54">
Prote&s;tant world. Whether all this mi&s;chief done, or in the direct train of doing, was in their original &s;cheme, I cannot &s;ay; I hope it was not; but this would have been the unavoidable con&s;equence of their proceedings, had not the flames they had lighted up in their fury been extingui&s;hed in their blood.</P>
<P>All the time that this horrid &s;cene was acting, or avenging, as well as for &s;ome time before, and ever &s;ince, the wicked in&s;tigators of this unhappy multi|tude, guilty, with every aggravation, of all their crimes, and &s;creened in a cowardly darkne&s;s from their puni&s;hment, continued, without interruption, pity, or remor&s;e, to blow up the blind rage of the populace, with a continued bla&s;t of pe&s;tilential libels, which infected and poi&s;oned the very air we breathed in.</P>
<P>The main drift of all the libels, and all the riots, was, to force Parliament (to per&s;uade us was hope|le&s;s) into an act of national perfidy, which has no example. For, Gentlemen, it is proper you &s;hould all know what infamy we e&s;caped by re|fu&s;ing that repeal, for a refu&s;al of which, it &s;eems, I, among others, &s;tand &s;omewhere or other accu&s;ed. When we took away, on the motives which I had the honour of &s;tating to you, a few of the innumerable penalties upon an oppre&s;&s;ed and injured people, the relief was not ab&s;olute, but given on a &s;tipulation and compact between them and us; for we bound down the Roman Ca|tholics with the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths, to bear true allegiance to this government; to abjure all &s;ort of
<PB N="53" REF="55">
temporal power in any other; and to renounce, under the &s;ame &s;olemn obligations, the doctrines of &s;y&s;tematic perfidy, with which they &s;tood (I con|ceive very unju&s;tly) charged. Now our mode&s;t petitioners came up to us, mo&s;t humbly praying nothing more, than that we &s;hould break our faith without any one cau&s;e what&s;oever of forfeiture a&s;|&s;igned; and when the &s;ubjects of this kingdom had, on their part, fully performed their engagement, we &s;hould refu&s;e, on our part, the benefit we had &s;tipu|lated on the performance of tho&s;e very conditions that were pre&s;cribed by our own authority, and taken on the &s;anction of our public faith&mdash;That is to &s;ay, when we had inveigled them with fair pro|mi&s;es within our door, we were to &s;hut it on them; and, adding mockery to outrage&mdash;to tell them, <Q REND="inline">"Now we have got you fa&s;t&mdash;your con&s;ciences are bound to a power re&s;olved on your de&s;truc|tion. We have made you &s;wear, that your reli|gion obliges you to keep your faith; fools as you are! we will now let you &s;ee, that our reli|gion enjoins us to keep no faith with you."</Q> They who would advi&s;edly call upon us to do &s;uch things, mu&s;t certainly have thought us not only a convention of treacherous tyrants, but a gang of the lowe&s;t and dirtie&s;t wretches that ever di&s;graced humanity. Had we done this, we &s;hould have indeed proved, that there were <HI>&s;ome</HI> in the world whom no faith could bind; and we &s;hould have <HI>convicted</HI> our&s;elves of that odious principle of which Papi&s;ts &s;tood <HI>accu&s;ed</HI> by tho&s;e very &s;avages,
<PB N="54" REF="56">
who wi&s;hed us, on that accu&s;ation, to deliver them over to their fury.</P>
<P>In this audacious tumult, when our very name and character, as gentlemen, was to be cancelled for ever along with the faith and honour of the nation, I, who had exerted my&s;elf very little on the quiet pa&s;&s;ing of the bill, thought it nece&s;&s;ary then to come forward. I was not alone; but though &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed members on all &s;ides, and par|ticularly on ours, added much to their high reputa|tion by the part they took on that day, (a part which will be remembered as long as honour, &s;pi|rit, and eloquence have e&s;timation in the world) I may and will value my&s;elf &s;o far, that yielding in abilities to many, I yielded in zeal to none. With warmth, and with vigour, and animated with a ju&s;t and natural indignation, I called forth every fa|culty that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and I directed it in every way which I could po&s;&s;ibly employ it. I laboured night and day. I laboured in Parliament: I la|boured out of Parliament. If therefore the re&s;olu|tion of the Hou&s;e of Commons, refu&s;ing to com|mit this act of unmatched turpitude, be a crime, I am guilty among the foremo&s;t. But indeed, what|ever the faults of that Hou&s;e may have been, no one member was found hardy enough to propo&s;e &s;o infamous a thing; and on full debate we pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;olution again&s;t the petitions with as much unanimity, as we had formerly pa&s;&s;ed the law of which the&s;e petitions demanded the repeal.</P>
<P>There was a circum&s;tance (ju&s;tice will not &s;uffer
<PB N="55" REF="57">
me to pa&s;s it over) which, if any thing could enforce the rea&s;ons I have given, would fully ju&s;tify the act of relief, and render a repeal, or any thing like a re|peal, unnatural, impo&s;&s;ible. It was the behaviour of the per&s;ecuted Roman Catholics under the acts of violence and brutal in&s;olence, which they &s;uffered. I &s;uppo&s;e there are not in London le&s;s than four or five thou&s;and of that per&s;ua&s;ion from my country, who do a great deal of the mo&s;t laborious works in the metropolis; and they chiefly inhabit tho&s;e quar|ters, which were the principal theatre of the fury of the bigotted multitude. They are known to be men of &s;trong arms, and quick feelings, and more remarkable for a determined re&s;olution, than clear ideas, or much fore&s;ight. But though provoked by every thing that can &s;tir the blood of men, their hou&s;es and chapels in flames, and with the mo&s;t atrocious profanations of every thing which they hold &s;acred before their eyes, not a hand was moved to retaliate, or even to defend. Had a conflict once begun, the rage of their per&s;ecutors would have redoubled. Thus fury encrea&s;ing by the reverberation of outrages, hou&s;e being fired for hou&s;e, and church for chapel, I am con|vinced, that no power under heaven could have prevented a general conflagration; and at this day London would have been a tale. But I am well informed, and the thing &s;peaks it, that their clergy exerted their whole influence to keep their people in &s;uch a &s;tate of forbearance and quiet, as, when I look back, fills me with a&s;toni&s;h|ment; but not with a&s;toni&s;hment only. Their
<PB N="56" REF="58">
merits on that occa&s;ion ought not to be forgot|ten; nor will they, when Engli&s;hmen come to recollect them&s;elves. I am &s;ure it were far more proper to have called them forth, and given them the thanks of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, than to have &s;uffered tho&s;e worthy clergymen, and excel|lent citizens, to be hunted into holes and corners, whil&s;t we are making low-minded inqui&s;itions into the number of their people; as if a tolerating prin|ciple was never to prevail, unle&s;s we were very &s;ure that only a few could po&s;&s;ibly take advantage of it. But indeed we are not yet well recovered of our fright. Our rea&s;on, I tru&s;t, will return with our &s;ecurity; and this unfortunate temper will pa&s;s over like a cloud.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I have now laid before you a few of the rea&s;ons for taking away the penalties of the act of 1699, and for refu&s;ing to e&s;tabli&s;h them on the riotous requi&s;ition of 1780. Becau&s;e I would not &s;uffer any thing which may be for your &s;atisfac|tion to e&s;cape, permit me ju&s;t to touch on the ob|jections urged again&s;t our act and our re&s;olves, and intended as a ju&s;tification of the violence offered to both Hou&s;es. <Q REND="inline">"Parliament," they a&s;&s;ert, "was too ha&s;ty, and they ought, in &s;o e&s;&s;ential and alarming a change, to have proceeded with a far greater degree of deliberation."</Q> The di|rect contrary. Parliament was too &s;low. They took four&s;core years to deliberate on the repeal of an act which ought not to have &s;urvived a &s;econd &s;e&s;&s;ion. When at length, after a procra&s;|tination of near a century, the bu&s;ine&s;s was taken up, it proceeded in the mo&s;t public manner, by
<PB N="57" REF="59">
the ordinary &s;tages, and as &s;lowly as a law &s;o evi|dently right as to be re&s;i&s;ted by none, would na|turally advance. Had it been read three times in one day, we &s;hould have &s;hewn only a becoming readine&s;s to recogni&s;e by protection the undoubted dutiful behaviour of tho&s;e whom we had but too long puni&s;hed for offences of pre&s;umption or con|jecture. But for what end was that bill to linger beyond the u&s;ual period of an unoppo&s;ed mea&s;ure? Was it to be delayed until a rabble in Edinburgh &s;hould dictate to the Church of England what mea&s;ure of per&s;ecution was fitting for her &s;afety? Was it to be adjourned until a fanatical force could be collected in London, &s;ufficient to frighten us out of all our ideas of policy and ju&s;tice? Were we to wait for the profound lectures on the rea|&s;on of &s;tate, eccle&s;ia&s;tical and political, which the Prote&s;tant A&s;&s;ociation have &s;ince conde&s;cended to read to us? Or were we, &s;even hundred Peers and Commoners, the only per&s;ons ignorant of the rib|bald invectives which occupy the place of argu|ment in tho&s;e remon&s;trances, which every man of common ob&s;ervation had heard a thou&s;and times over, and a thou&s;and times over had de&s;pi&s;ed? All men had before heard what they have to &s;ay; and all men at this day know what they dare to do; and I tru&s;t, all hone&s;t men are equally influenced by the one, and by the other.</P>
<P>But they tell us, that tho&s;e our fellow-citizens, who&s;e chains we have a little relaxed, are enemies to liberty and our free con&s;titution.&mdash;Not enemies, I pre&s;ume, to their <HI>own</HI> liberty. And as to the
<PB N="58" REF="60">
con&s;titution, until we give them &s;ome &s;hare in it, I do not know on what pretence we can examine into their opinions about a bu&s;ine&s;s in which they have no intere&s;t or concern. But after all, are we equally &s;ure, that they are adver&s;e to our con&s;ti|tution, as that our &s;tatutes are ho&s;tile and de&s;truc|tive to them? For my part, I have rea&s;on to be|lieve, their opinions and inclinations in that re&s;pect are various, exactly like tho&s;e of other men; and if they lean more to the Crown than I, and than many of you think <HI>we</HI> ought, we mu&s;t remember, that he who aims at another's life, is not to be &s;urpri&s;ed if he flies into any &s;anctuary that will receive him. The tenderne&s;s of the executive power is the natural a&s;ylum of tho&s;e upon whom the laws have declared war; and to complain that men are inclined to favour the means of their own &s;afety, is &s;o ab&s;urd, that one forgets the inju&s;tice in the ridicule.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t fairly tell you, that &s;o far as my prin|ciples are concerned, (principles, that I hope will only depart with my la&s;t breath) that I have no idea of a liberty unconnected with hone&s;ty and ju&s;tice. Nor do I believe, that any good con&s;titutions of government or of freedom, can find it nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ecurity to doom any part of the people to a permanent &s;lavery. Such a con&s;titution of freedom, if &s;uch can be, is in effect no more than another name for the tyranny of the &s;tronge&s;t faction; and factions in republics have been, and are, full as capable as monarchs, of the mo&s;t cruel oppre&s;&s;ion and in|ju&s;tice. It is but too true, that the love, and even
<PB N="59" REF="61">
the very idea, of genuine liberty, is extremely rare. It is but too true, that there are many, who&s;e whole &s;cheme of freedom, is made up of pride, perver&s;e|ne&s;s, and in&s;olence. They feel them&s;elves in a &s;tate of thraldom, they imagine that their &s;ouls are cooped and cabbined in, unle&s;s they have &s;ome man, or &s;ome body of men, dependent on their mercy. This de&s;ire of having &s;ome one below them, de&s;cends to tho&s;e who are the very lowe&s;t of all,&mdash;and a Prote&s;tant cobler, deba&s;ed by his poverty, but exalted by his &s;hare of the ruling church, feels a pride in knowing, it is by his genero&s;ity alone, that the peer, who&s;e footman's in&s;tep he mea&s;ures, is able to keep his chaplain from a jail. This di&s;po&s;ition is the true &s;ource of the pa&s;&s;ion, which many men in very humble life, have taken to the American war. <HI>Our</HI> &s;ubjects in America; <HI>our</HI> colonies; <HI>our</HI> dependants. This lu&s;t of party-power, is the liberty they hunger and thir&s;t for; and this Syren &s;ong of ambition, has charmed ears, that one would have thought were never organi&s;ed to that &s;ort of mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>This way, of <HI>pro&s;cribing the citizens by denomina|tions and general de&s;criptions,</HI> dignified by the name of rea&s;on of &s;tate, and &s;ecurity for con&s;titutions and commonwealths, is nothing better at bottom, than the mi&s;erable invention of an ungenerous ambition, which would fain hold the &s;acred tru&s;t of power, without any of the virtues or any of the energies, that give a title to it; a receipt of policy, made up of a dete&s;table compound of ma|lice, cowardice, and &s;loth. They would govern
<PB N="60" REF="62">
men again&s;t their will; but in that government they would be di&s;charged from the exerci&s;e of vigi|lance, providence, and fortitude; and therefore, that they may &s;leep on their watch, they con&s;ent to take &s;ome one divi&s;ion of the &s;ociety into partner|&s;hip of the tyranny over the re&s;t. But let govern|ment, in what form it may be, comprehend the whole in its ju&s;tice, and re&s;train the &s;u&s;picious by its vigilance; let it keep watch and ward; let it di&s;co|ver by its &s;agacity, and puni&s;h by its firmne&s;s, all delinquency again&s;t its power, whenever delin|quency exi&s;ts in the overt acts; and then it will be as &s;afe as ever God and nature intended it &s;hould be. Crimes are the acts of individuals, and not of deno|minations; and therefore arbitrarily to cla&s;s men under general de&s;criptions, in order to pro&s;cribe and puni&s;h them in the lump for a pre&s;umed delinquency, of which perhaps but a part, perhaps none at all, are guilty, is indeed a compendious method, and &s;aves a world of trouble about proof; but &s;uch a method, in&s;tead of being law, is an act of unnatural rebellion again&s;t the legal dominion of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice; and this vice, in any con&s;titu|tion that entertains it, at one time or other will certainly bring on its ruin.</P>
<P>We are told, that this is not a religious per&s;e|cution, and its abettors are loud in di&s;claiming all &s;everities on account of con&s;cience. Very fine indeed! then let it be &s;o; they are not per&s;ecu|tors; they are only tyrants. With all my heart. I am perfectly indifferent concerning the pretexts upon which we torment one another; or whether it be for the con&s;titution of the Church of England,
<PB N="61" REF="63">
or for the con&s;titution of the State of England, that people choo&s;e to make their fellow-crea|tures wretched. When we were &s;ent into a place of authority, you that &s;ent us had your&s;elves but one commi&s;&s;ion to give. You could give us none to wrong or oppre&s;s, or even to &s;uffer any kind of oppre&s;&s;ion or wrong, on any grounds what&s;oever; not on political, as in the affairs of America; not on commercial, as in tho&s;e of Ireland; not in civil, as in the laws for debt; not in religious, as in the &s;tatutes again&s;t Prote&s;tant or Catholic Di&s;&s;enters. The diver&s;ified but connected fabric of univer&s;al ju&s;tice, is well cramped and bolted together in all its parts; and depend upon it, I never have em|ployed, and I never &s;hall employ, any engine of power which may come into my hands, to wrench it a&s;under. All &s;hall &s;tand, if I can help it, and all &s;hall &s;tand connected. After all, to complete this work, much remains to be done; much in the Ea&s;t, much in the We&s;t. But great as the work is, if our will be ready, our powers are not deficient.</P>
<P>Since you have &s;uffered me to trouble you &s;o much on this &s;ubject, permit me, Gentlemen, to detain you a little longer. I am indeed mo&s;t &s;oli|citous to give you perfect &s;atisfaction. I find there are &s;ome of a better and &s;ofter nature than the per&s;ons with whom I have &s;uppo&s;ed my&s;elf in de|bate, who neither think ill of the act of relief, nor by any means de&s;ire the repeal, not accu&s;ing but lamenting what was done, on account of the con|&s;equences, have frequently expre&s;&s;ed their wi&s;h,
<PB N="62" REF="64">
that the late act had never been made. Some of this de&s;cription, and per&s;ons of worth, I have met with in this city. They conceive, that the prejudices, whatever they might be, of a large part of the people, ought not to have been &s;hock|ed; that their opinions ought to have been pre|viou&s;ly taken, and much attended to; and that thereby the late horrid &s;cenes might have been pre|vented.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, my notions are widely different; and I never was le&s;s &s;orry for any action of my life. I like the bill the better, on account of the events of all kinds that followed it. It relieved the real &s;ufferers; it &s;trengthened the &s;tate; and, by the di&s;orders that en&s;ued, we had clear evidence, that there lurked a temper &s;omewhere, which ought not to be fo&s;tered by the laws. No ill con&s;equences whatever could be attributed to the act it&s;elf. We knew before-hand, or we were poorly in&s;tructed, that toleration is odious to the intolerant; freedom to oppre&s;&s;ors; property to robbers; and all kinds and degrees of pro&s;perity to the envious. We knew, that all the&s;e kinds of men would gladly gratify their evil di&s;po&s;itions under the &s;anction of law and religion, if they could: if they could not, yet, to make way to their objects, they would do their utmo&s;t to &s;ubvert all religion and all law. This we certainly knew. But knowing this, is there any rea&s;on, becau&s;e thieves break in and &s;teal, and thus bring detriment to you, and draw ruin on them&s;elves, that I am to be &s;orry that you are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;hops, and of warehou&s;es, and of
<PB N="63" REF="65">
whole&s;ome laws to protect them? Are you to build no hou&s;es, becau&s;e de&s;perate men may pull them down upon their own heads? Or, if a malignant wretch will cut his own throat, becau&s;e he &s;ees you give alms to the nece&s;&s;itous and de&s;erving; &s;hall his de&s;truction be attributed to your charity, and not to his own deplorable madne&s;s? If we repent of our good actions, what, I pray you, is left for our faults and follies? It is not the beneficence of the laws, it is the unnatural temper which beneficence can fret and &s;our, that is to be lamented. It is this temper which, by all rational means, ought to be &s;weetened and corrected. If froward men &s;hould refu&s;e this cure, can they vitiate any thing but them&s;elves? Does evil &s;o react upon good, as not only to retard its motion, but to change its nature? If it can &s;o operate, then good men will always be in the power of the bad; and virtue, by a dreadful rever&s;e of order, mu&s;t lie un|der perpetual &s;ubjection and bondage to vice.</P>
<P>As to the opinion of the people, which &s;ome think, in &s;uch ca&s;es, is to be implicitly obeyed; near two years tranquillity, which followed the act, and its in&s;tant imitation in Ireland, proved abundantly, that the late horrible &s;pirit was, in a great mea&s;ure, the effect of in&s;idious art, and per|ver&s;e indu&s;try, and gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entation. But &s;uppo&s;e that the di&s;like had been much more delibe|rate, and much more general than I am per&s;uaded it was&mdash;When we know, that the opinions of even the greate&s;t multitudes, are the &s;tandard of rectitude, I &s;hall think my&s;elf obliged to make tho&s;e opinions
<PB N="64" REF="66">
the ma&s;ters of my con&s;cience. But if it may be doubted whether Omnipotence it&s;elf is competent to alter the e&s;&s;ential con&s;titution of right and wrong, &s;ure I am, that &s;uch <HI>things,</HI> as they and I, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no &s;uch power. No man carries further than I do the policy of making govern|ment plea&s;ing to the people. But the wide&s;t range of this politic complai&s;ance is confined with|in the limits of ju&s;tice. I would not only con&s;ult the intere&s;t of the people, but I would chearfully gratify their humours. We are all a &s;ort of chil|dren, that mu&s;t be &s;oothed and managed. I think I am not au&s;tere or formal in my nature. I would bear, I would even my&s;elf play my part in, any innocent buffooneries, to divert them. But I ne|ver will act the tyrant for their amu&s;ement. If they will mix malice in their &s;ports, I &s;hall never con&s;ent to throw them any living, &s;entient, creature what&s;oever, no not &s;o much as a kitling, to tor|ment.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But if I profe&s;s all this impolitic &s;tubbornne&s;s, I may chance never to be elected into Parliament."</Q> It is certainly not plea&s;ing to be put out of the public &s;ervice. But I wi&s;h to be a member of Parliament, to have my &s;hare of doing good, and re&s;i&s;ting evil. It would therefore be ab&s;urd to re|nounce my objects, in order to obtain my &s;eat. I deceive my&s;elf indeed mo&s;t gro&s;sly, if I had not much rather pa&s;s the remainder of my life hidden in the rece&s;&s;es of the deepe&s;t ob&s;curity, feeding my mind even with the vi&s;ions and imaginations of &s;uch things, than to be placed on the mo&s;t &s;plendid

throne of the univer&s;e, tantalized with a denial of the practice of all which can make the greate&s;t &s;ituation any other than the greate&s;t cur&s;e. Gen|tlemen, I have had my day. I can never &s;uffici|ently expre&s;s my gratitude to you, for having &s;et me in a place, wherein I could lend the &s;lighte&s;t help to great and laudable de&s;igns. If I have had my &s;hare, in any mea&s;ure giving quiet to private property, and private con&s;cience; if by my vote I have aided in &s;ecuring to families the be&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, peace; if I have joined in reconciling kings to their &s;ubjects, and &s;ubjects to their prince; if I have a&s;&s;i&s;ted to loo&s;en the foreign holdings of the citizen, and taught him to look for his protection to the laws of his country, and for his comfort to the goodwill of his countrymen;&mdash;if I have thus taken my part with the be&s;t of men in the be&s;t of their actions, I can &s;hut the book;&mdash;I might wi&s;h to read a page or two more&mdash;but this is enough for my mea&s;ure.&mdash;I have not lived in vain.</P>
<P>And now, Gentlemen, on this &s;erious day, when I come, as it were, to make up my account with you, let me take to my&s;elf &s;ome degree of hone&s;t pride on the nature of the charges that are again&s;t me. I do not here &s;tand before you ac|cu&s;ed of venality, or of neglect of duty. It is not &s;aid, that, in the long period of my &s;ervice, I have, in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, &s;acrificed the &s;lighte&s;t of your intere&s;ts to my ambition, or to my for|tune. It is not alledged, that to gratify any anger, or revenge of my own, or of my party, I have had a &s;hare in wronging or oppre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="66" REF="68">
any de&s;cription of men, or any one man in any de&s;cription. No! the charges again&s;t me, are all of one kind, that I have pu&s;hed the principles of general ju&s;tice and benevolence too far; further than a cautious policy would warrant; and further than the opinions of many would go along with me.&mdash;In every accident which may happen through life, in pain, in &s;orrow, in depre&s;&s;ion, and di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;I will call to mind this accu&s;ation; and be com|forted.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I &s;ubmit the whole to your judg|ment. Mr. Mayor, I thank you for the trouble you have taken on this occa&s;ion. In your &s;tate of health, it is particularly obliging. If this company &s;hould think it advi&s;eable for me to withdraw, I &s;hall re&s;pectfully retire; if you think otherwi&s;e, I &s;hall go directly to the Council-hou&s;e and to the Change, and without a moment's de|lay, begin my canva&s;s.</P>
