<HEAD>Respect to Age.</HEAD>
<P>In the Panathenaea, (a course of solemn games at Athens) an old Athenian came late to the theatre, and found it difficult to procure a seat. The audience even made a jest of him, calling to him <HI>Here is room;</HI> and sitting close when he came fo the spot, so as always to reject him. The old man, being in great distress, not only with toiling along, but with being made a public laughing stock, at length came to the seats of the Spartans, who, all rising to a man, gave him the best place among them. At this, the whole theatre resounded with shouts of applause; and the old Athenian rising up, exclaimed, "the Athenians <HI>know</HI> what is right, but the Spartans <HI>practise</HI> it."</P>

Let me kill this Omer, my master, and I shall die contented. It is for thy sake only I desire this." The king, laughing at this new mode of clearing his own justice, acquitted the wretch.</P>

After Jack had finished this account with a transport of joy, he lengthened his visage, by telling the doctor all was ruined, for without two guineas to buy a cage for the mice, he could not present them. The doctor, unfortunately, as he said himself, had but half a guinea in the world, which he offered to lend him. But Pilkington was not to be beat out of his scheme; he perceived the doctor's watch hanging up in his room, and, after premising on the indelicacy of the proposal, hinted, that "if he could spare that watch for a week, he could raise a few guineas on it, which he would pay him with gratitude. The doctor would not be the means of spoiling a man's fortune for such a trifle. He accordingly took down the watch, and gave it to him; which Jack immediately took to the pawnbroker's, raised what he could on it, and never once looked after the doctor, till he sent to borrow another half guinea from him on his death bed, which the doctor very generously sent him.</P>

<HEAD>A Detection.</HEAD>
<P>A clever young fellow being at dinner at a friend's house, and observing one of the company

slily pocket a table spoon, let it pass till he pre|pared to take his leave; and then marching up to the sideboard, took one and put it through his button-hole. Upon being asked his motive for so curious a manoeuvre, he replied, "I saw my neighbour here at dinner put a spoon in his pocket: and, supposing it was a customary thing at this house, I preferred taking mine away in my button-hole."</P>
<P>It should have been mentioned first, that the same gentleman, during dinner, having observed that the top dish of fish was not quite so fresh as might have been wished, took one, and put it to his mouth, and then to his ear. The lady of the house having asked him the reason, he answered, "I had a brother who was shipwrecked the day before yesterday, so was asking if the fish could give any information concerning his body, to which it replied, it knew nothing of the transac|tion, not having been at sea these <HI>three weeks.</HI>"</P>

<HEAD>A Pillory Conversation.</HEAD>
<P>An English and a French gentleman had a dis|pute which nation most excelled in wit. The English gentleman insisted that it was common here among the very mob; and to convince the other of the English superiority, he carried him to Charing-cross, where a man stood in the pillory for keeping a disorderly house. The populace looking on it as an inconsiderable offence, they did not throw any thing at, or ill-treat him, as is usual for crimes of a different nature; therefore the fel|low was quite easy and unconcerned, and lifted the upper part of the pillory, sometimes higher, and then let it lower again, just to suit himself.
<PB N="19" REF="18">
Upon which, one of the spectators, who stood there with a load upon his head, seeing the offender so dexterous, said, "It is my opinion this fellow has served his time to the pillory, he is so handy about it." To which a droll rogue in a leather apron replied, "Served his time to it! You may be sure he has; do you not see that he has set up for himself?" "Set up!" said another, "how can that be set up, when he stands?" "Why you foolish dog," rejoined the second who spoke, "do you not know it is a standing business?" And now a fellow in a woollen cap calls out to the man in the pillory, "Harkee, cocky," said he, "had you not rather the jokes should fly about than the rotten eggs?" "Aye, sure, master," replies the man, "though it was on account of some sort of jokes I got my head into this hole." At this time a barrow woman added one more to the assembly; when a porter accosts her with, "Well, Moll, what brought you here?" To which she returned, "Curiosity, and my legs, Jack; now I hope the fool's answered." "Fool!" says the fellow, "what do you mean by that, you slut?" "Why," re|joined she, "you must be a fool because you can neither read nor write." "Very true," answered the porter, "but I can set my mark;" and imme|diately striking her in the face, gave her a black eye: this brought on a battle between the porter and a man who took the woman's part; when the Frenchman, seeing the English fight like bull-dogs, said, "The English shine in <HI>war</HI> as well as <HI>wit.</HI>"</P>

"Poor duckeys!" he cried, "I am sorry I am in a hurry, and cannot get you some bread; but here is sixpence for you to buy some;" and there|upon threw a sixpence to the ducks, which one of them gobbled up.

<L>A London taylor, as 'tis said,</L>
<L>By buckram, canvass, tape, and thread,</L>
<L>Sleeve-linings, pockets, silk, and twist,</L>
<L>And all the long expensive list</L>

<L>By these and other arts in trade,</L>

<L>And did what few had ever done,</L>
<L>Left <HI>thirty thousand</HI> to his son!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The son, a gay young swagg'ring blade,</L>
<L>Abhorr'd the very name of trade,</L>
<L>And lest reflection should be thrown</L>
<L>On him, resolv'd to quit the town,</L>
<L>And travel where he was not known.</L>
<L>In gilded coach and liv'ries gay,</L>
<L>To Oxford first he took his way;</L>
<L>There beaux and belles his taste admire,</L>
<L>His equipage and rich attire;</L>
<L>But nothing was so much ador'd</L>

<L>The purse-proud coxcomb took the hint,</L>
