<HEAD>SUBSTANCE OF THE SPEECH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE EDMUND BURKE.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Burke's &s;peech on the Report of the army has not been correctly &s;tated in &s;ome of the public papers, It is of con|&s;equence to him not to be mi&s;under&s;tood. The matter which incidentally came into di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is of the mo&s;t &s;erious import|ance. It is thought that the heads and
<PB N="2" REF="3">
&s;ub&s;tance of the &s;peech will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e &s;ufficiently. If in making the ab&s;tract, through defect of memory, in the per&s;on who now gives it, any dif|ference at all &s;hould be perceived from the &s;peech as it was &s;poken, it will not, the editor imagines, be found in any thing which may amount to a retraction of the opinions he then maintained, or to any &s;oftening in the expre&s;&s;ions in which they were conveyed.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke &s;poke a con&s;iderable time in an&s;wer to various arguments which had been in&s;i&s;ted upon by Mr. Grenville and Mr. Pitt, for keeping an increa&s;ed peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, and again&s;t an improper jealou&s;y of the Mini&s;ters, in whom a full confidence, &s;ubject to re&s;pon&s;ibility, ought to be placed, on account of their knowledge of the real &s;ituation of af|fairs; the exact &s;tate of which it fre|quently
<PB N="3" REF="4">
happened, that they could not di&s;clo&s;e, without violating the con&s;titu|tional and political &s;ecrecy, nece&s;&s;ary to the well being of their country.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke &s;aid in &s;ub&s;tance, "that confidence might become a vice, and jea|lou&s;y a virtue, according to circum|&s;tances. That confidence, of all public virtues, was the mo&s;t dangerous, and jea|lou&s;y in an Hou&s;e of Commons, of all public vices, the mo&s;t tolerable; e&s;pecially where the number and the charge of &s;tanding armies, in time of peace, was the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>That in the annual mutiny bill, the annual army was declaredly to be for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving the balance of power in Europe. The propriety of its being larger or &s;maller depended, therefore, upon the true &s;tate of that balance. If the in|crea&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="5">
of peace e&s;tabli&s;hments demanded of Parliament agreed with the manife&s;t appearance of the balance, confidence in Mini&s;ters, as to the particulars, would be very proper. If the increa&s;e was not at all &s;upported by any &s;uch appear|ance, he thought great jealou&s;y might, and ought to be, entertained on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>That he did not find, on a review of all Europe, that, politically, we &s;tood, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, of danger from any one &s;tate or kingdom it contained; nor that any other foreign powers than our own allies were likely to obtain a con&s;iderable preponderance in the &s;cale.</P>
<P>That France had hitherto been our fir&s;t object, in all con&s;iderations, con|cerning the balance of power. The pre|&s;ence or ab&s;ence of France totally varied
<PB N="5" REF="6" MS="y">
every &s;ort of &s;peculation relative to that balance.</P>
<P>That France was, at this time, in a po|litical light, to be con&s;idered, as expunged out of the &s;y&s;tem of Europe. Whether &s;he ever could appear in it again, as a lead|ing power, was not ea&s;y to determine: but at pre&s;ent he con&s;idered France as not politically exi&s;ting; and mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly it would take up much time to re&s;tore her to her former active exi&s;tence &mdash; <HI>Gallos quoque in bellis florui&s;&s;e audivimus,</HI> might po&s;&s;ibly be the language of the ri&s;ing generation. He did not mean to deny that it was our duty to keep our eye on that nation, and to regulate our preparation by the &s;ymp|toms of her recovery.</P>
<P>That it was to her <HI>&s;trength,</HI> not to her <HI>form of government</HI> which we were to attend; becau&s;e Republics, as well as
<PB N="6" REF="7" MS="y">
monarchies, were &s;u&s;ceptible of ambition, jealou&s;y, and anger, the u&s;ual cau&s;es of war.</P>
<P>But if, while France continued in this &s;woon, we &s;hould go on increa&s;ing our expences, we &s;hould certainly make our|&s;elves le&s;s a match for her, when it be|came our concern to arm.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid, that as &s;he had &s;peedily fallen, &s;he might &s;peedily ri&s;e again. He doubted this. That the fall from an height was with an accelerated velo|city; but to lift a weight up to that height again was difficult, and oppo&s;ed by the laws of phy&s;ical and political gravita|tion.</P>
<P>In a political view, France was low in|deed. She had lo&s;t every thing, even to her name
<Q><PB N="7" REF="8" MS="y">
<L>"Jacet ingens littere truncus</L>
<L>"Avol&s;umque humeris <HI>caput,</HI> et &s;ine <HI>nomine</HI> corpus."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> Mr. Burke, probably, had in his mind the remainder of the pa&s;&s;age, and was filled with &s;ome congenial apprehen|&s;ions: <Q><L>Haec finis Priami fatorum; hic exitus illum</L><L>"Sorte tulit, Trojam incen&s;am, &amp; prolap&s;a videntem</L><L>"Pergama; tot quondam populis, terri&s;que, &s;uperbum</L><L>"Regnatorem A&s;iae. Jacet ingens littore truncus,</L><L>"Avol&s;umque humeris caput, &amp; &s;ine nomine corpus.</L><L><HI>"At me</HI> tum primum &s;oevus circum&s;tetit horror;</L><L><HI>"Ob&s;tupui:</HI> &s;ubiit chari genitoris imago"&mdash;</L></Q></NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>He was a&s;toni&s;hed at it&mdash;he was alarmed at it&mdash;he trembled at the uncertainty of all human greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>Since the Hou&s;e had been prorogued in the &s;ummer much work was done in France. The French had &s;hewn them|&s;elves the able&s;t architects of ruin that had hitherto exi&s;ted in the world. In that very
<PB N="8" REF="9" MS="y">
&s;hort &s;pace of time they had completely pulled down to the ground, their mo|narchy; their church; their nobility; their law; their revenue; their army; their navy; their commerce; their arts; and their manufactures. They had done their bu&s;ine&s;s for us as rivals, in a way in which twenty Ramilies or Blenheims could never have done it. Were we ab&s;olute conquerors, and France to lye pro&s;trate at our feet, we &s;hould be a&s;hamed to &s;end a commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ettle their affairs, which could impo&s;e &s;o hard a law upon the French, and &s;o de&s;tructive of all their con&s;equence as a nation, as that they had impo&s;ed upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>France, by the mere circum&s;tance of its vicinity, had been, and in a degree always mu&s;t be, an object of our vigilance, either with regard to her actual power, or to her
<PB N="9" REF="10">
influence and example. As to the former, he had &s;poken; as to the latter, (her example) he &s;hould &s;ay a few words: for by this ex|ample our friend&s;hip and our intercour&s;e with that nation had once been, and might again, become more dangerous to us than their wor&s;t ho&s;tility.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t century, Louis the Fourteenth had e&s;tabli&s;hed a greater and better di&s;ci|plined military force than ever had been before &s;een in Europe, and with it a perfect de&s;poti&s;m. Though that de&s;poti&s;m was proudly arrayed in manners, gallantry, &s;plendor, magnificence, and even covered over with the impo&s;ing robes of &s;cience, literature, and arts, it was, in government, nothing better than a painted and gilded tyranny; in religion, an hard &s;tern intole|rance, the &s;it companion and auxiliary to the de&s;potic tyranny which prevailed in its
<PB N="10" REF="11">
government. The &s;ame character of de&s;po|ti&s;m in&s;inuated it&s;elf into every court of Europe&mdash;the &s;ame &s;pirit of di&s;proportioned magnificence&mdash;the &s;ame love of &s;tanding armies, above the ability of the people. In particular, our then Sovereigns, King Charles and King James, fell in love with the government of their neighbour, &s;o flat|tering to the pride of Kings. A &s;imilarity of &s;entiments brought on connections equally dangerous to the intere&s;ts and li|berties of their country. It were well that the infection had gone no farther than the Throne. The admiration of a govern|ment flouri&s;hing and &s;ucce&s;sful, unchecked in its operations, and &s;eeming therefore to compa&s;s its objects more &s;peedily and effectually, gained &s;omething upon all ranks of people. The good patriots of that day, however, &s;truggled again&s;t it. They &s;ought nothing more anxiou&s;ly than to break off all communication with France, and
<PB N="11" REF="12">
to beget a total alienation from its councils and its example; which, by the animo&s;ity prevalent between the abettors of their religious &s;y&s;tem and the a&s;&s;ertors of ours, was, in &s;ome degree, effected.</P>
<P>This day the evil is totally changed in France: but there is an evil. The di&s;ea&s;e is altered; but the vicinity of the two countries remains, and mu&s;t remain; and the natural mental habits of mankind are &s;uch, that the pre&s;ent di&s;temper of France it is far more likely to be contagious than the old one; for it is not quite ea&s;y to &s;pread a pa&s;&s;ion for &s;ervitude among the people: but in all evils of the oppo&s;ite kind our natural inclinations are flattered. In the ca&s;e of de&s;poti&s;m there is the <HI>foedum crimen &s;ervitutis</HI>; in the la&s;t the <HI>fal&s;a</HI> &s;pe|cies <HI>libertatis</HI>; and accordingly, as the hi&s;|torian &s;ays, <HI>pronis auribus accipitur.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13" MS="y">In the la&s;t age we were in danger of be|ing entangled by the example of France in the net of a relentle&s;s de&s;poti&s;m. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing upon that example. It exi&s;ts no longer. Our pre|&s;ent danger from the example of a peo|ple, who&s;e character knows no medium, is, with regard to government, a danger from anarchy; a danger of being led through an admiration of &s;ucce&s;sful fraud and violence, to an imitation of the exce&s;&s;es of an irrational, unprincipled, pro&s;cribing, confi&s;cating, plundering, ferocious, bloody, and tyrannical democracy. On the &s;ide of religion, the danger of their example is no longer from intolerance, but from Athei&s;m; a foul, unnatural vice, foe to all the dig|nity and con&s;olation of mankind; which &s;eems in France, for a long time, to have been embodie into a faction, accredited, and almo&s;t avowed.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14">The&s;e are our pre&s;ent dangers from France: but, in his opinion, the very wor&s;t part of the example &s;et is, in the late a&s;&s;umption of citizen&s;hip by the army, and the whole of the arrangement, or rather di&s;arrangement of their military.</P>
<P>He was &s;orry that his right honourable friend (Mr. Fox) had dropped even a word expre&s;&s;ive of exultation on that circum|&s;tance; or that he &s;eemed of opinion that the objection from &s;tanding armies was at all le&s;&s;ened by it. He attributed this opi|nion of Mr. Fox entirely to his known zeal for the be&s;t of all cau&s;es, Liberty. That it was with a pain inexpre&s;&s;ible he was obliged to have even the &s;hadow of a difference with his friend, who&s;e authority would be always great with him, and with all thinking people &mdash; <HI>Quae maxima &s;emper cen&s;etur nobis, et</HI> erit <HI>quae maxima &s;emper.</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="14" REF="15">
His confidence in Mr. Fox was &s;uch, and &s;o ample, as to be almo&s;t implicit. That he was not a&s;hamed to avow that de|gree of docility. That when the choice is well made, it &s;trengthens in&s;tead of oppre&s;s|ing our intellect. That he who calls in the aid of an equal under&s;tanding, doubles his own. He who profits of a &s;uperior under|&s;tanding, rai&s;es his powers to a level with the height of the &s;uperior under&s;tanding he unites with. He had found the benefit of &s;uch a junction, and would not lightly depart from it. He wi&s;hed almo&s;t, on all occa&s;ions, that his &s;entiments were under|&s;tood to be conveyed in Mr. Fox's words; and that he wi&s;hed, as among&s;t the greate&s;t benefits he could wi&s;h the country, an emi|nent &s;hare of power to that right honou|rable gentleman; becau&s;e he knew that, to his great and ma&s;terly under&s;tanding, he had joined the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree of that natural moderation, which is the be&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="16" MS="y">
corrective of power; that he was of the mo&s;t artle&s;s, candid, open, and benevolent di&s;po&s;ition; di&s;intere&s;ted in the extreme; of a temper mild and placable, even to a fault; without one drop of gall in his whole con&s;titution.</P>
<P>That the Hou&s;e mu&s;t perceive, from his coming forward to mark an expre&s;&s;ion or two of his be&s;t friend, how anxious he was to keep the di&s;temper of France from the lea&s;t countenance in England, where he was &s;ure &s;ome wicked per&s;ons had &s;hewn a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition to recommend an imitation of the French &s;pirit of Re|form. He was &s;o &s;trongly oppo&s;ed to any the lea&s;t tendency towards the <HI>means</HI> of in|troducing a democracy like theirs, as well as to the <HI>end</HI> it&s;elf, that much as it would afflict him, if &s;uch a thing could be at|tempted, and that any friend of his could concur in &s;uch mea&s;ures, (he was far,
<PB N="16" REF="17" MS="y">
very far, from believing they could); he would abandon his be&s;t friends, and join with his wor&s;t enemies to oppo&s;e either the means or the end; and to re&s;i&s;t all vio|lent exertions of the &s;pirit of innovation, &s;o di&s;tant from all principles of true and &s;afe reformation; a &s;pirit well calculated to overturn &s;tates, but perfectly unfit to amend them.</P>
<P>That he was no enemy to reformation. Almo&s;t every bu&s;ine&s;s in which he was much concerned, from the fir&s;t day he &s;at in that Hou&s;e to that hour, was a bu&s;ine&s;s of reformation; and when he had not been employed in correcting, he had been em|ployed in re&s;i&s;ting abu&s;es. Some traces of this &s;pirit in him now &s;tand on their &s;ta|tute book. In his opinion, any thing which unnece&s;&s;arily tore to pieces the con|texture of the &s;tate, not only prevented all real reformation, but introduced evils
<PB N="17" REF="18" MS="y">
which would call, but, perhaps, call in vain, for new reformation.</P>
<P>That he thought the French nation very unwi&s;e. What they valued them&s;elves on, was a di&s;grace to them. They had gloried (and &s;ome people in England had thought fit to take &s;hare in that glory) in making a revolution; as if revolutions were good things in them&s;elves. All the horrors, and all the crimes of the anarchy which led to their revolution, which attend its progre&s;s, and which may virtually attend it in its e&s;tabli&s;hment, pa&s;s for nothing with the lovers of revolutions. The French have made their way through the de&s;truction of their country, to a bad con&s;titution, when they were ab&s;olutely in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a good one. They were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it the day the States met in &s;eparate orders. Their bu&s;ine&s;s, had they been either virtuous, or wi&s;e, or had been left to their own judge|ment,
<PB N="18" REF="19">
was to &s;ecure the &s;tability and inde|pendence of the States, according to tho&s;e orders, under the Monarch on the Throne. It was then their duty to redre&s;s griev|ances.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of redre&s;&s;ing grievances, and im|proving the fabric of their State, to which they were called by their Monarch, and &s;ent by their Country, they were made to take a very different cour&s;e. They fir&s;t de&s;troyed all the balances and counterpoi&s;es which &s;erve to fix the &s;tate; and to give it a &s;teady direction; and which furni&s;h &s;ure correctives to any violent &s;pirit which may prevail in any of the orders. The&s;e ba|lances exi&s;ted in their olde&s;t con&s;titution; and in the con&s;titution of this country; and in the con&s;titution of all the countries in Europe. The&s;e they ra&s;hly de&s;troyed, and then they melted down the whole into one incongruous, ill-connected ma&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20" MS="y">When they had done this, they in&s;tantly, with the mo&s;t atrocious perfidy and breach of all faith among men, laid the axe to the root of all property, and con&s;equently of all national pro&s;perity, by confi&s;cating all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the church. They made and recorded a &s;ort of in&s;titute and dige&s;t of anarchy, called the rights of man in &s;uch a pedantic abu&s;e of elementary principles as would have di&s;graced boys at &s;chool; but this declaration of rights was wor&s;e than trifling and pedantic in them; as by their name and authority they &s;y&s;te|matically de&s;troyed every hold of authority by opinion, religious or civil, on the minds of the people. By this mad declaration they &s;ubverted the &s;tate; and brought on &s;uch calamities as no country, without a long war, has ever been known to &s;uffer, and which may in the end produce &s;uch a war, and, perhaps, many &s;uch.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21" MS="y">With them the que&s;tion was not be|tween de&s;poti&s;m and liberty. The &s;acrifice they made of the peace and power of their country was not made on the altar of Free|dom. They brought them&s;elves into all the calamities they &s;uffer, not that through them they might obtain the Briti&s;h con&s;ti|tution; they plunged them&s;elves head|long into tho&s;e calamities, to prevent them|&s;elves from &s;ettling into that con&s;titution, or into any thing re&s;embling it.</P>
<P>That if they &s;hould perfectly &s;ucceed in what they propo&s;e, as they are likely enough to do, and e&s;tabli&s;h a democracy, or a mob of democracies, in a country circum&s;tanced like France, they will e&s;ta|bli&s;h a very bad government &mdash; a very bad &s;pecies of tyranny.</P>
<P>That, the wor&s;t effect of all their pro|ceeding was on their military, which was
<PB N="21" REF="22" MS="y">
rendered an army for every purpo&s;e but that of defence. That, if the que&s;tion was, whether &s;oldiers were to forget they were citizens, as an ab&s;tract propo&s;ition, he could have no difference about it; though, as it is u&s;ual, when ab&s;tract principles are to be applied, much was to be thought on the manner of uniting the character of citizen and &s;oldier. But as applied to the events which had happened in France, where the ab&s;tract principle was cloathed with its cir|cum&s;tances, he thought that his friend would agree with him, that what was done there furni&s;hed no matter of exulta|tion, either in the act or the example. The&s;e &s;oldiers were not citizens; but ba&s;e hireling mutineers, and mercenary &s;ordid de&s;erters, wholly de&s;titute of any honou|rable principle. Their conduct was one of the fruits of that anarchic &s;pirit, from the evils of which a democracy it&s;elf was to be received by tho&s;e who were the
<PB N="22" REF="23">
lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to that form as a cure. It was not an army in corps and with di&s;|cipline, and embodied under the re&s;pecta|ble patriot citizens of the &s;tate in re&s;i&s;ting tyranny. Nothing like it. It was the ca&s;e of common &s;oldiers de&s;erting from their officers, to join a furious, licentious popu|lace. It was a de&s;ertion to a cau&s;e, the real object of which was to level all tho&s;e in&s;titutions, and to break all tho&s;e connec|tions, natural and civil, that regulate and hold together the community by a chain of &s;ubordination; to rai&s;e &s;oldiers again&s;t their officers; &s;ervants again&s;t their ma&s;ters; trade&s;men again&s;t their cu&s;tomers; arti|ficers again&s;t their employers; tenants again&s;t their landlords; curates again&s;t their bi&s;hops; and children again&s;t their parents. That this cau&s;e of theirs was not an enemy to &s;ervitude, but to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>He wi&s;hed the Hou&s;e to con&s;ider, how
<PB N="23" REF="24">
the members would like to have their man&s;ions pulled down and pillaged, their per&s;ons abu&s;ed, in&s;ulted, and de&s;troyed; their title deeds brought out and burned before their faces, and them&s;elves and their families driven to &s;eek refuge in every nation throughout Europe, for no other rea&s;on than this, that without any fault of theirs, they were born gentlemen, and men of property, and were &s;u&s;pected of a de&s;ire to pre&s;erve their con&s;ideration and their e&s;tates. The de&s;ertion in France was to aid an abominable &s;edition, the very profe&s;&s;ed principle of which was an impla|cable ho&s;tility to nobility and gentry, and who&s;e &s;avage war-whoop was <HI>"a l' Ari&s;|tocrate,"</HI> by which &s;en&s;ele&s;s, bloody cry, they animated one another to rapine and murder; whil&s;t abetted by ambitious men of another cla&s;s, they were cru&s;hing every thing re&s;pectable and virtuous in their na|tion, and to their power di&s;gracing almo&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="25" MS="y">
every name, by which we formerly knew there was &s;uch a country in the world as France.</P>
<P>He knew too well, and he felt as much as any man, how difficult it was to accommodate a &s;tanding army to a free con&s;titution, or to any con&s;titu|tion. An armed, di&s;ciplined body is, in its e&s;&s;ence, dangerous to liberty; undi&s;ci|plined, it is ruinous to &s;ociety. Its com|ponent parts are, in the latter ca&s;e, neither good citizens, nor good &s;oldiers. What have they thought of in France, under &s;uch a difficulty as almo&s;t puts the human faculties to a &s;tand? They have put their army under &s;uch a variety of principles of duty, that it is more likely to breed liti|gants, pettyfoggers, and mutineers, than &s;oldiers. They have to balance their Crown army, another army, deriving under ano|ther authority, called a municipal army&mdash;
<PB N="25" REF="26" MS="y">
a balance of armies, not of orders. The&s;e latter they have de&s;troyed with every mark of in&s;ult and oppre&s;&s;ion. States may, and they will be&s;t, exi&s;t with a partition of power. Armies cannot exi&s;t under a di|vided command. This &s;tate of things he thought, in effect, a &s;tate of war, or, at be&s;t, but a truce in&s;tead of peace, in the country.</P>
<P>What a dreadful thing is a &s;tanding army, for the conduct of the whole, or any part of which, no man is re&s;pon&s;ible! In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the French crown army, is there any General who can be re&s;pon&s;ible for the obedience of a Brigade? Any Colonel for that of a Regiment? Any Captain for that of a Company? And as to the municipal army, reinforced as it is by the new citizen-de&s;erters, under who&s;e command are they? Have we not &s;een them, not led by, but dragging their
<PB N="26" REF="27" MS="y">
nominal Commander with a rope about his neck, when they, or tho&s;e whom they accompanied, proceeded to the mo&s;t attro|cious acts of trea&s;on and murder? Are any of the&s;e armies? Are any of the&s;e citi|zens!</P>
<P>We have in &s;uch a difficulty as that of fitting a &s;tanding army to the &s;tate, as he conceived, done much better. We have not di&s;tracted our army by divided princi|ples of obedience. We have put them un|der a &s;ingle authority, with a &s;imple (our common) oath of fidelity; and we keep the whole under our annual in&s;pection. This was doing all that could be &s;afely done.</P>
<P>He felt &s;ome concern that this &s;trange thing, called a Revolution in France, &s;hould be compared with the glorious event, commonly called the Revolution in
<PB N="27" REF="28" MS="y">
England; and the conduct of the &s;oldiery, on that occa&s;ion, compared with the beha|viour of &s;ome of the troops of France in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. At that period the Prince of Orange, a prince of the blood royal in England, was called in by the flower of the Engli&s;h ari&s;tocracy to defend its ancient con&s;titution, and not to level all di&s;tinctions. To this Prince, &s;o invited, the ari&s;tocratic leaders who commanded the troops went over with their &s;everal corps, in bodies, to the deliverer of their country. Ari&s;tocratic leaders brought up the corps of citizens who newly enli&s;ted in this cau&s;e. Military obedience changed its ob|ject; but military di&s;cipline was not for a moment interrupted in its principle. The troops were ready for war, but indi&s;po&s;ed to mutiny.</P>
<P>But as the conduct of the&s;e armies was different, &s;o was that of the whole Engli&s;h
<PB N="28" REF="29" MS="y">
nation at that time. In truth, the circum|&s;tances of our revolution (as it is called) and that of France are ju&s;t the rever&s;e of each other in almo&s;t every particular, and in the whole &s;pirit of the tran&s;action. With us it was the ca&s;e of a legal Monarch at|tempting arbitrary power&mdash;in France it is the ca&s;e of an arbitrary Monarch, begin|ning, from whatever cau&s;e, to legali&s;e his authority. The one was to be re&s;i&s;ted, the other was to be managed and directed; but in neither ca&s;e was the order of the &s;tate to be changed, le&s;t government might be ruined, which ought only to be corrected and legali&s;ed. With us we got rid of the man, and pre&s;erved the con|&s;tituent parts of the &s;tate. There they get rid of the con&s;tituent parts of the &s;tate, and keep the man. What we did was in truth and &s;ub&s;tance, and in a con&s;titutional light, a revolution, not made, but pre|vented. We took &s;olid &s;ecurities; we &s;et|led
<PB N="29" REF="30" MS="y">
doubtful que&s;tions; we corrected ano|malies in our law. In the &s;table funda|mental parts of our con&s;titution we made no revolution; no, nor any alteration at all. We did not impair the monarchy. Per|haps it might be &s;hewn that we &s;trength|ened it very con&s;iderably. The nation kept the &s;ame ranks, the &s;ame orders, the &s;ame privileges, the &s;ame franchi&s;es, the &s;ame rules for property, the &s;ame &s;ubordi|nations, the &s;ame order in the law, in the revenue, and in the magi&s;tracy; the &s;ame lords, the &s;ame commons, the &s;ame corpo|rations, the &s;ame electors.</P>
<P>The church was not impaired. Her e&s;tates, her maje&s;ty, her &s;plendor, her orders and gradations continued the &s;ame; &s;he was pre&s;erved in her full efficiency, and cleared only of a certain intolerance, which was her weakne&s;s and di&s;grace. The church and the &s;tate were the &s;ame after the revo|lution
<PB N="30" REF="31" MS="y">
that they were before, but better &s;e|cured in every part.</P>
<P>Was little done becau&s;e a revolution was not made in the con&s;titution? No! Every thing was done; becau&s;e we com|menced with reparation not with ruin. Accordingly the &s;tate flouri&s;hed. In&s;tead of lying as dead, in a &s;ort of trance, or expo&s;ed as &s;ome others, in an epi|leptic fit, to the pity or deri&s;ion of the world, for her wild, ridiculous, convul|&s;ive movements, impotent to every pur|po&s;e but that of da&s;hing out our brains again&s;t the pavement, Great Britain ro&s;e above the &s;tandard, even of her former &s;elf. An aera of a more improved do|me&s;tic pro&s;perity then commenced, and &s;till continues, not only unimpaired, but growing, under the wa&s;ting hand of time. All the energies of the country were awakened. England never pre&s;ented a
<PB N="31" REF="32">
firmer countenance, or a more vigorous arm, to all her enemies, and to all her rivals. Europe under her re&s;pired and revived. Every where &s;he appeared as the protector, a&s;&s;ertor, or avenger, of liberty. A war was made and &s;upported again&s;t for|tune it&s;elf. The treaty of Ry&s;wick, which fir&s;t limited the power of France, was &s;oon after made: the grand alliance very &s;hortly followed, which &s;hook to the foundations the dreadful power which menaced the independence of mankind. The &s;tates of Europe lay happy under the &s;hade of a great and free monarchy, which knew how to be great without endangering its own peace at home, or the internal or external peace of any of its neighbours.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke &s;aid he &s;hould have felt very unplea&s;antly if he had not delivered the&s;e &s;entiments. He was near the end of his natural, probably &s;till nearer to the end of
<PB N="32" REF="33">
his political career; that he was weak and weary; and wi&s;hed for re&s;t. That he was little di&s;po&s;ed to controver&s;ies, or what is called a detailed oppo&s;ition. That at his time of life, if he could not do &s;omething by &s;ome &s;ort of weight of opinion, natu|ral or acquired, it was u&s;ele&s;s and indeco|rous to attempt any thing by mere &s;truggle. <HI>Turpe &s;enex Miles.</HI> That he had for that rea&s;on little attended the army bu&s;ine&s;s, or that of the revenue, or almo&s;t any other matter of detail for &s;ome years pa&s;t. That he had, however, his ta&s;k. He was far from condemning &s;uch oppo&s;ition; on the contrary, he mo&s;t highly applauded it, where a ju&s;t occa&s;ion exi&s;ted for it, and gentlemen had vigour and capacity to pur|&s;ue it. Where a great occa&s;ion occurred, he was, and while he continued in Parlia|ment, would be among&s;t the mo&s;t active and the mo&s;t earne&s;t, as he hoped he had &s;hewn on a late event. With re&s;pect to
<PB N="33" REF="34" MS="y">
the con&s;titution it&s;elf, he wi&s;hed few al|terations in it. Happy if he left it not the wor&s;e for any &s;hare he had taken in its &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Mr. Fox then ro&s;e, and declared, in &s;ub|&s;tance, that &s;o far as regarded the French army, he went no farther than the general principle, by which that army &s;hewed it&s;elf indi&s;po&s;ed to be an in&s;trument in the &s;ervi|tude of their fellow citizens, but did not enter into the particulars of their conduct. He declared, that he did not affect a demo|cracy. That he always thought any of the &s;imple, unbalanced governments bad; &s;imple monarchy, &s;imple ari&s;tocracy, &s;imple democracy; he held them all imperfect or vicious: all were bad by them&s;elves: the compo&s;ition alone was good. That the&s;e had been always his principles, in which he had agreed with his friend, Mr. Burke, of whom he &s;aid many kind and flattering
<PB N="34" REF="35">
things, which Mr. Burke, I take it for granted, will know him&s;elf too well to think he merits, from any thing but Mr. Fox's acknowledged good nature. Mr. Fox thought, however, that, in many ca&s;es, he was rather carried too far by his hatred to innovation.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke &s;aid, he well knew that the&s;e had been Mr. Fox's invariable opinions; that they were a &s;ure ground for the con|fidence of his country. But he had been fearful, that cabals of very different inten|tions, would be ready to make u&s;e of his great name, again&s;t his character and &s;en|timents, in order to derive a credit to their de&s;tructive machinations.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan then ro&s;e, and made a lively and eloquent &s;peech again&s;t Mr. Burke; in which, among other things, he &s;aid that Mr. Burke had libelled the Na|tional
<PB N="35" REF="36">
A&s;&s;embly of France, and had ca&s;t out reflections on &s;uch characters as tho&s;e of the Marquis de la Fayette and Mr. Bailly.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke &s;aid, that he did not libel the National A&s;&s;embly of France, whom he con&s;idered very little in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e matters. That he thought all the &s;ub&s;tantial power re&s;ided in the republic of Paris, who&s;e authority guided, or who&s;e example was followed by all the Republics of France. The Republic of Paris had an army under their orders, and not under tho&s;e of the National A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>N. B. As to the particular gentlemen, I do not remember that Mr. Burke men|tioned either of them&mdash; certainly not Mr. Bailly. He alluded, undoubtedly, to the ca&s;e of the Marquis de la Fayette; but whether what he a&s;&s;erted of him be a libel
<PB N="36" REF="37">
on him, mu&s;t be left to tho&s;e who are ac|quainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Pitt concluded the debate with becoming gravity and dignity, and a re|&s;erve on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, as related to France, fit for a per&s;on in a mini&s;terial &s;ituation. He &s;aid, that what he had &s;poken only regarded France when &s;he &s;hould unite, which he rather thought &s;he &s;oon might, with the liberty &s;he had acquired, the ble&s;&s;ings of law and order. He, too, &s;aid &s;everal civil things concern|ing the &s;entiments of Mr. Burke, as applied to this country.</P>
