<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON THE CAUSE OF THE PRESENT DISCONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an undertaking of &s;ome degree of delicacy to examine into the cau&s;e of public di&s;orders. If a man happens not to &s;ucceed in &s;uch an enquiry, he will be thought weak and vi&s;ionary; if he touches the true grievance, there is a danger that he may come near to per&s;ons of weight and con&s;equence, who will rather be exa&s;perated at the di&s;covery of their errors, than thankful for the occa&s;ion of correcting them. If he &s;hould be obliged to blame the favourites of the people, he will be con&s;idered as the tool of power; if he cen&s;ures tho&s;e in power, he will be looked on as an in&s;trument of faction. But in all exertions of duty &s;omething is to be hazarded. In ca&s;es of tumult and di&s;order, our law has inve&s;ted every man, in &s;ome &s;ort, with the authority of a magi&s;trate. When the affairs of the nation are di&s;tracted, private people are, by the &s;pirit of that law, ju&s;tified in &s;tepping a little out of their ordinary &s;phere. They enjoy a privilege, of &s;omewhat more dignity and effect, than that of idle lamentation over the calamities of their country. They may look into them narrowly; they may rea&s;on upon them liberally; and if they &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to di&s;cover the true &s;ource of the mi&s;chief, and to &s;ug|ge&s;t any probable method of removing it, though they may di&s;plea&s;e the rulers for the day, they are certainly of &s;ervice to the cau&s;e of Govern|ment. Government is deeply intere&s;ted in every thing which, even through the medium of &s;ome temporary unea&s;ine&s;s, may tend finally to
<PB N="2" REF="3">
compo&s;e the minds of the &s;ubject, and to conciliate their affections. I have nothing to do here with the ab&s;tract value of the voice of the people. But as long as reputation, the mo&s;t precious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every individual, and as long as opinion, the great &s;upport of the State, depend entirely upon that voice, it can never be con&s;idered as a thing of little con&s;equence either to individuals or to Government. Nations are not primarily ruled by laws; le&s;s by violence. Whatever original energy may be &s;uppo&s;ed either in force or regulation; the operation of both is, in truth, merely in&s;trumental. Nations are governed by the &s;ame methods, and on the &s;ame principles, by which an individual without authority is often able to govern tho&s;e who are his equals or his &s;uperi|ours; by a knowledge of their temper, and by a judicious management of it; I mean when ever publick affairs are &s;teadily and quietly conducted; not when Government is nothing but a continued &s;cu&s;&s;le between the magi&s;trate and the multitude; in which &s;ometimes the one and &s;ome times the other is uppermo&s;t; in which they alternately yield and prevail in a &s;eries of contemptible victories and &s;candalous &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions. The temper of the people among&s;t whom he pre&s;ides ought therefore to be the fir&s;t &s;tudy of a State&s;man. And the knowledge of this temper it is by no means impo&s;&s;ible for him to attain, if he has not an intere&s;t in being ignorant of what it is his duty to learn.</P>
<P>To complain of the age we live in, to murmur at the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of power, to lament the pa&s;t, to conceive extravagant hopes of the future, are the common di&s;po&s;itions of the greate&s;t part of mankind; indeed the nece&s;&s;ary effects of the ignorance and levity of the vulgar. Such complaints and humours have exi&s;ted in all times; yet as all times have <HI>not</HI> been alike, true political &s;agacity manife&s;ts it&s;elf, in di&s;tingui&s;hing that complaint, which only characterizes the general infirmity of human nature, from tho&s;e which are &s;ymptoms of the particular di&s;tempera|ture of our own air and &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Nobody, I believe, will con&s;ider it merely as the language of &s;pleen or di&s;appointment, if I &s;ay, that there is &s;omething particularly alarming in the pre&s;ent conjuncture. There is hardly a man in or out of power who holds any other language. That Government is at once dreaded and contemned; that the laws are de&s;poiled of all their re&s;pected and &s;alutary terrors; that their inaction is a &s;ubject of ridicule, and their ex|ertion of abhorrence; that rank, and office, and title, and all the &s;olemn plau&s;ibilities of the world, have lo&s;t their reverence and effect; that our foreign politicks are as much deranged as our dome&s;tic oeconomy; that our dependencies are &s;lackened in their affection, and loo&s;ened from their obedience; that we know neither how to yield nor how to inforce; that hardly any thing above or below, abroad or at home, is &s;ound and entire;
<PB N="3" REF="4">
but that di&s;connection and confu&s;ion, in offices, in parties, in families, in Parliament, in the nation, prevail beyond the di&s;orders of any former time: the&s;e are facts univer&s;ally admitted and lamented.</P>
<P>This &s;tate of things is the more extraordinary, becau&s;e the great parties which formerly divided and agitated the kingdom are known to be in a manner entirely di&s;&s;olved. No great external calamity has vi&s;ited the nation; no pe&s;tilence or famine. We do not labour at pre&s;ent under any &s;cheme of taxation new or oppre&s;&s;ive in the quantity or in the mode. Nor are we engaged in un&s;ucce&s;sful war; in which, our misfortunes might ea&s;ily pervert our judgement; and our minds, &s;ore from the lo&s;s of national glory, might feel every blow of Fortune as a crime in Government.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible that the cau&s;e of this &s;trange di&s;temper &s;hould not &s;ometimes become a &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e. It is a compliment due, and which I willingly pay, to tho&s;e who admini&s;ter our affairs, to take notice in the fir&s;t place of their &s;peculation. Our Mini&s;ters are of opinion, that the encrea&s;e of our trade and manufactures, that our growth by colo|nization and by conque&s;t, have concurred to accumulate immen&s;e wealth in the hands of &s;ome individuals; and this again being di&s;per&s;ed among&s;t the the people, has rendered them univer&s;ally proud, ferocious, and ungovern|able; that the in&s;olence of &s;ome from their enormous wealth, and the bold|ne&s;s of others from a guilty poverty, have rendered them capable of the mo&s;t atrocious attempts; &s;o that they have trampled upon all &s;ubordina|tion, and violently born down the unarmed laws of a free Government; barriers too feeble again&s;t the fury of a populace &s;o fierce and licentious as ours. They contend, that no adequate provocation has been given for &s;o &s;preading a di&s;content; our affairs having been conducted throughout with remarkable temper and con&s;ummate wi&s;dom. The wicked indu&s;try of &s;ome libellers, joined to the intrigues of a few di&s;appointed politicians, have, in their opinion, been able to produce this unnatural ferment in the nation.</P>
<P>Nothing indeed can be more unnatural than the pre&s;ent convul&s;ions of this country, if the above account be a true one. I confe&s;s I &s;hall a&s;&s;ent to it with great reluctance, and only on the compul&s;ion of the cleare&s;t and firme&s;t proofs; becau&s;e their account re&s;olves it&s;elf into this &s;hort, but di&s;couraging propo&s;ition, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That we have a very good Mini&s;try, but that we are a very bad people;"</Q>  that we &s;et our&s;elves to bite the hand that feeds us; that with a malignant in&s;anity we oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures, and un|gratefully vilify the per|gratefully vilify the per&s;ons of tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;ole object is our own peace and pro&s;perity. If a few puny libellers, acting under a knot of factions politicians, without virtue, parts, or character (&s;uch they are con&s;tantly repre&s;ented by the&s;e gentlemen), are &s;ufficient to excite this di&s;turbance, very perver&s;e mu&s;t be the di&s;po&s;ition of that people, among&s;t whom &s;uch
<PB N="4" REF="5">
a di&s;turbance can be excited by &s;uch means. It is be&s;ides no &s;mall aggravation of the public misfortune, that the di&s;ea&s;e, on this hypothe&s;is, appears to be without remedy. If the wealth of the nation be the cau&s;e of its turbulence, I imagine, it is not propo&s;ed to introduce poverty, as a con|&s;table to keep the peace. If our dominions abroad are the roots which feed all this rank luxuriance of &s;edition, it is not intended to cut them off in order to fami&s;h the fruit. If ourliberty has enfeebled the executive power, there is no de&s;ign, I hope, to call in the aid of de&s;poti&s;m, to fill up the deficiencies of law. Whatever may be intended, the&s;e things are not yet profe&s;&s;ed. We &s;eem therefore to be driven to ab&s;olute de&s;|pair; for we have no other materials to work upon, but tho&s;e out of which God has been plea&s;ed to form the inhabitants of this i&s;land. If the&s;e be radically and e&s;&s;entially vitious, all that can be &s;aid is, that tho&s;e men are very unhappy, to who&s;e fortune or duty it falls to admini&s;ter the affairs of this untoward people. I hear it indeed &s;ometimes a&s;&s;erted, that a &s;teady per&s;everance in the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, and a rigorous puni&s;hment of tho&s;e who oppo&s;e them, will in cour&s;e of time infallibly put an end to the&s;e di&s;orders. But this in my opinion is &s;aid without much ob&s;ervation of our pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition, and without any knowledge at all of the gene|ral nature of mankind. If the matter of which this nation is compo&s;ed be &s;o very fermentable as the&s;e gentlemen de&s;cribe it, leaven never will be wanting to work it up, as long as di&s;content, revenge, and ambition, have exi&s;tence in the world. Particular puni&s;hments are the cure for acci|dental di&s;tempers in the State; they inflame rather than allay tho&s;e heats which ari&s;e from the &s;ettled mi&s;management of the Government, or from a natural ill di&s;po&s;ition in the people. It is of the utmo&s;t moment not to make mi&s;takes in the u&s;e of &s;trong mea&s;ures; and firmne&s;s is then only a virtue when it accompanies the mo&s;t perfect wi&s;dom. In truth, incon|&s;tancy is a &s;ort of natural corrective of folly and ignorance.</P>
<P>I am not one of tho&s;e who think that the people are never in the wrong. They have been &s;o, frequently and outrageou&s;ly, both in other countries and in this. But I do &s;ay, that in all di&s;putes between them and their rulers, the pre&s;umption is at lea&s;t upon a par in favour of the people. Experience may perhaps ju&s;tify me in going further. Where popular di&s;|contents have been very prevalent; it may well be affirmed and &s;up|ported, that there has been generally &s;omething found ami&s;s in the con&s;titution, or in the conduct of Government. The people have no intere&s;t in di&s;order. When they do wrong, it is their error, and not their crime. But with the governing part of the State, it is far otherwi&s;e. They certainly may act ill by de&s;ign, as well as by mi&s;take. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Les revolutions qui arrivent dans les grands etats ne &s;ont point un effect du hazard, ni du caprice des peuples.

I. p. 133.</NOTE>."</Q> The&s;e are the words of a great man; of a Mini&s;ter of &s;tate; and a zealous a&s;&s;ertor of Monarchy. They are applied to the <HI>&s;y&s;tem of Favouriti&s;m</HI> which was adopted by Henry the Third of France, and to the dreadful con&s;e|quences it produced. What he &s;ays of revolutions is equally true of all great di&s;turbances. If this pre&s;umption in favour of the &s;ubjects again&s;t the tru&s;tees of power be not the more probable, I am &s;ure it is the more comfortable &s;peculation; becau&s;e it is more ea&s;y to change an admi|ni&s;tration than to reform a people.</P>
<P>Upon a &s;uppo&s;ition therefore, that in the opening of the cau&s;e the pre|&s;umptions &s;tand equally balanced between the parties, there &s;eems &s;uffi|cient ground to entitle any per&s;on to a fair hearing, who attempts &s;ome other &s;cheme be&s;ides that ea&s;y one which is fa&s;hionable in &s;ome fa&s;hionable companies, to account for the pre&s;ent di&s;contents. It is not to be argued that we endure no grievance, becau&s;e our grievances are not of the &s;ame &s;ort with tho&s;e under which we laboured formerly; not preci&s;ely tho&s;e which we bore from the Tudors, or vindicated on the Stuarts. A great change has taken place in the affairs of this country. For in the &s;ilent lap&s;e of events as material alterations have been in&s;en&s;ibly brought about in the policy and character of governments and nations, as tho&s;e which have been marked by the tumult of public revolutions.</P>
<P>It is very rare indeed for men to be wrong in their feelings concerning public mi&s;conduct; as rare to be right in their &s;peculation upon the cau&s;e of it. I have con&s;tantly ob&s;erved, that the generality of people are fifty years, at lea&s;t, behind-hand in their politicks. There are but very few, who are capable of comparing and dige&s;ting what pa&s;&s;es before their eyes at different times and occa&s;ions, &s;o as to form the whole into a di&s;tinct &s;y&s;tem. But in books every thing is &s;ettled for them, without the exertion of any con&s;iderable diligence or &s;agacity. For which rea&s;on men are wi&s;e with but little reflexion, and good with little &s;elf|denial, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of all times except their own. We are very uncorrupt and tolerably enlightened judges of the tran&s;actions of pa&s;t ages; where no pa&s;&s;ions deceive, and where the whole train of cir|cum&s;tances, from the trifling cau&s;e to the tragical event, is &s;et in an orderly &s;eries before us. Few are the partizans of departed tyranny; and to be a Whig on the bu&s;ine&s;s of an hundred years ago, is very con&s;i&s;tent with every advantage of pre&s;ent &s;ervility. This retro&s;pective wi&s;dom, and hi&s;torical patrioti&s;m, are things of wonderful conventence; and &s;erve admirably to reconcile the old quarrel between &s;peculation and prac|tice.
<PB N="6" REF="7">
Many a &s;tern republican, after gorging him&s;elf with a full fea&s;t of admiration of the Grecian commonwealths and of our true Saxon con|&s;titution, and di&s;charging all the &s;plendid bile of his virtuous indignation on King John and King James, &s;its down perfectly &s;atisfied to the coar&s;|e&s;t work and homelie&s;t job of the day he lives in. I believe there was no profe&s;&s;ed admirer of Henry the Eighth among the in&s;truments of the la&s;t King James; nor in the court of Henry the Eighth, was there, I dare &s;ay, to be &s;ound a &s;ingle advocate for the favourites of Richard the Second.</P>
<P>No complai&s;ance to our Court, or to our age, can make me believe na|ture to be &s;o changed, but that public liberty will be among us, as among our ance&s;tors, obnoxious to &s;ome per&s;on or other; and that op|portunities will be furni&s;hed, for attempting at lea&s;t, &s;ome altera|tion to the prejudice of our con&s;titution. The&s;e attempts will naturally vary in their mode according to times and circum&s;tances. For ambition, though it has ever the &s;ame general views, has not at all times the &s;ame means, nor the &s;ame particular objects. A great deal of the furniture of ancient tyranny is worn to rags; the re&s;t is entirely out of fa&s;hion. Be&s;ides, there are few State&s;men &s;o very clum&s;y and awkward in their bu&s;ine&s;s, as to fall into the identical &s;nare which has proved fatal to their predece&s;&s;ors. When an arbitrary impo&s;ition is attempted upon the &s;ubject, undoubtedly it will not bear on its fore-head the name of <HI>Ship|moncy.</HI> There is no danger that an exten&s;ion of the <HI>Fore&s;t laws</HI> &s;hould be the cho&s;en mode of oppre&s;&s;ion in this age. And when we hear any in&s;tance of mini&s;terial rapacity, to the prejudice of the rights of private life, it will certainly not be the exaction of two hundred pullets, from a woman of fa&s;hion, for leave to lye with her own hu&s;band<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Uxor Hugonis de Nevill dat Domino Regi ducentas Gallinas, eo quod po&s;&s;it jacere una nocte cum Domino &s;uo Hugone de Nevill." <BIBL>Maddox, Hi&s;t.

<P>Every age has its own manners, and its politicks dependent upon them; and the &s;ame attempts will not be made again&s;t a con&s;titution fully form|ed and matured, that were u&s;ed to de&s;troy it in the cradle, or to re&s;i&s;t its growth during its infancy.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the being of Parliament, I am &s;atisfied no de&s;igns have ever been entertained &s;ince the Revolution. Every one mu&s;t perceive, that it is &s;trongly the intere&s;t of the Court, to have &s;ome &s;econd cau&s;e inter|po&s;ed between the Mini&s;ters and the people. The gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons have an intere&s;t equally &s;trong, in &s;u&s;taining the part of that intermediate cau&s;e. However they may hire out the <HI>u&s;ufruct</HI> of their voices, they never will part with the <HI>fee and inheritance.</HI> Accordingly tho&s;e who have been of the mo&s;t known devotion to the will and plea&s;ure of a Court, have at the &s;ame time been mo&s;t forward in a&s;&s;erting an high authority in the Hou&s;e of Commons. When they knew who
<PB N="7" REF="8">
were to u&s;e that authority, and how it was to be employed, they thought it never could be carried too far. It mu&s;t be always the wi&s;h of an un|con&s;titutional State&s;man, that an Hou&s;e of Commons who are entirely dependent upon him, &s;hould have every right of the people entirely de|pendent upon their plea&s;ure. It was &s;oon di&s;covered, that the forms of a free, and the ends of an arbitrary Government, were things not alto|gether incompatible.</P>
<P>The power of the Crown, almo&s;t dead and rotten as Prerogative, has grown up anew, with much more &s;trength, and far le&s;s odium, under the name of Influence. An Influence, which operated without noi&s;e and with|out violence, an influence which converted the very antagoni&s;t, into the in|&s;trument, of power, which contained in it&s;elf a perpetual principle of growth and renovation, and which the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and the pro&s;perity of the country equally tended to augment, was an admirable &s;ub&s;titute for a Prerogative, that being only the off&s;pring of antiquated prejudices, had moulded in its original &s;tamina irre&s;i&s;tible principles of decay and di&s;&s;olu|tion. The ignorance of the people is a bottom but for a temporary &s;y&s;tem; the intere&s;t of active men in the &s;tate is a foundation perpetual and infal|lible. However, &s;ome circum&s;tances, ari&s;ing, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, in a great degree from accident, prevented the effects of this influence for a long time from breaking out in a manner capable of exciting any &s;e|rious apprehen&s;ions. Although Government was &s;trong and flouri&s;hed exceedingly, the <HI>Court</HI> had drawn far le&s;s advantage than one would imagine from this great &s;ource of power.</P>
<P>At the Revolution, the Crown, deprived, for the ends of the Revolu|tion it&s;elf, of many prerogatives, was found too weak to &s;truggle again&s;t all the difficulties which pre&s;&s;ed &s;o new and un&s;ettled a Govern|ment. The Court was obliged therefore to delegate a part of its powers to men of &s;uch intere&s;t as could &s;upport, and of &s;uch fidelity as would adhere to, its e&s;tabli&s;hment. Such men were able to draw in a greater number to a concurrence in the common defence. This con|nexion, nece&s;&s;ary at fir&s;t, continued long after conventent; and properly conducted might indeed, in all &s;ituations, be an u&s;eful in&s;trument of Government. At the &s;ame time through the intervention of men of popular weight and character, the people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;ecurity for their ju&s;t portion of importance in the State. But as the title to the Crown grew &s;tronger by long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and by the con&s;tant encrea&s;e of its in|fluence, the&s;e helps have of late &s;eemed to certain per&s;ons no better than in|cumbrances. The powerful managers for Government, were not &s;uffici|ently &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the plea&s;ure of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of immediate and per&s;onal favour, &s;ometimes from a confidence in their own &s;trength natural and acquired; &s;ometimes from a fear of offending their friends, and weak|ening
<PB N="8" REF="9">
that lead in the country, which gave them a con&s;ideration in|dependent of the Court. Men acted as if the Court could receive, as well as confer an obligation. The influence of Government, thus di|vided in appearance between the Court and the leaders of parties, be|came in many ca&s;es an acce&s;&s;ion rather to the popular than to the royal &s;cale; and &s;ome part of that influence which would otherwi&s;e have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as in a &s;ort of mortmain and unalienable domain, returned again to the great occan from whence it aro&s;e, and circulated among the people. This method therefore of governing by men of great natural intere&s;t or great acquired con&s;ideration, was viewed in a very invidious light by the true lovers of ab&s;olute monarchy. It is the nature of de&s;poti&s;m to abhor power held by any means but its own momentary plea&s;ure; and to annihilate all intermediate &s;ituations be|tween boundle&s;s &s;trength on its own part, and total debility on the part of the people.</P>
<P>To get rid of all this intermediate and independent importance, and <HI>to &s;ecure to the Court the unlimited and uncontrolled u&s;e of its own va&s;t influence, under the &s;ole direction of its own private favour,</HI> has for &s;ome years pa&s;t been the great object of policy. If this were compa&s;&s;ed, the influence of the Crown mu&s;t of cour&s;e produce all the effects which the mo&s;t &s;an|guine partizans of the Court could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire. Government might then be carried on without any concurrence on the part of the people; without any attention to the dignity of the greater, or to the affections of the lower &s;orts. A new project was therefore devi&s;ed, by a certain &s;et of intriguing men, totatly different from the &s;y&s;tem of Admini&s;tration which had prevailed &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick. This pro|ject, I have heard, was fir&s;t conceived by &s;ome per&s;ons in the court of Frederick Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>The carlie&s;t attempt in the execution of this de&s;ign was to &s;et up for Mini&s;ter, a per&s;on, in rank indeed re&s;pectable, and very ample in fortune; but who, to the moment of this va&s;t and &s;udden clevation, was little known or con&s;idered in the kingdom. To him the whole nation was to yield an immediate and implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But whether it was for want of &s;irmne&s;s to bear up again&s;t the fir&s;t oppo&s;ition; or that things were not yet fully ripened, or that this method was not found the mo&s;t eligible; that idea was &s;oon abandoned. The in&s;trumental part of the project was a little altered, to accommodate it to the time, and to bring things more gradually and more &s;urely to the one great end propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of the reformed plan was to draw <HI>a line which &s;hould &s;epa|rate the Court from the Mini&s;try.</HI> Hitherto the&s;e names had been looked upon as &s;ynonymous; but for the future, Court and Admini&s;tration were to be con&s;idered as things totally di&s;tinct. By this operation, two &s;y&s;tems of
<PB N="9" REF="10">
Admini&s;tration were to be formed; one which &s;hould be in the real &s;ecret and confidence; the other merely o&s;ten&s;ible, to perform the official and executory duties of Government. The latter were alone to be re&s;pon&s;i|ble; whil&s;t the real advi&s;ers, who enjoyed all the power, were effectually removed from all the danger.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>A party under the&s;e leaders was to be formed in favour of the Court again&s;t the Mini&s;try:</HI> this party was to have a large &s;hare in the emoluments of Government, and to hold it totally &s;eparate from, and in|dependent of, o&s;ten&s;ible Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>The third point, and that on which the &s;ucce&s;s of the whole &s;cheme ul|timately depended, was <HI>to bring Parliament to an acquie&s;cence in this project.</HI> Parliament was therefore to be taught by degrees a total indiffer|ence to the per&s;ons, rank, influence, abilities, connexions, and character, of the Mini&s;ters of the Crown. By means of a di&s;cipline, on which I &s;hall &s;ay more hereafter, that body was to be habituated to the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, and the mo&s;t di&s;cordant politicks. All connexions and dependencies among &s;ubjects were to be entirely di&s;&s;olved. As hitherto bu&s;ine&s;s had gone through the hands of leaders of Whigs or Tories, men of talents to conciliate the people, and to engage their confidence, now the method was to be altered; and the lead was to be given to men of no &s;ort of con&s;ideration or credit in the country. This want of natural importance was to be their very title to delegated power. Members of Parliament were to be hardened into an in&s;en&s;ibility to pride as well to duty. Tho&s;e high and haughty &s;entiments, which are the great &s;upport of indepen|dence, were to be let down gradually. Point of honour and precedence were no more to be regarded in Parliamentary decorum, than in a Turki&s;h army. It was to be avowed, as a con&s;titutional maxim, that the King might appoint one of his footmen, or one of your foot-men, for Mini&s;ter; and that he ought to be, and that he would be, as well followed as the fir&s;t name for rank or wi&s;dom in the nation. Thus Parliament was to look on, as if perfectly unconcerned; while a cabal of the clo&s;et and back-&s;tairs was &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of a national Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>With &s;uch a degree of acquie&s;cence, any mea&s;ure of any Court might well be deemed thoroughly &s;ecure. The capital objects, and by much the mo&s;t flattering characteri&s;ticks of arbitrary power, would be obtained. Every thing would be drawn from its holdings in the country to the per&s;onal favour and inclination of the Prince. This favour would be the &s;ole introduction to power, and the only tenure by which it was to be held: &s;o that no per&s;on looking towards another, and all looking to|wards the Court, it was impo&s;&s;ible but that the motive which &s;olely in|fluenced every man's hopes mu&s;t come in time to govern every man's
<PB N="10" REF="11">
conduct; till at la&s;t the &s;ervility became univer&s;al, in &s;pite of the dead letter of any laws or in&s;titutions what&s;oever.</P>
<P>How it &s;hould happen that any man could be tempted to venture upon &s;uch a project of Government, may at fir&s;t view appear &s;urprizing. But the fact is, that opportunities very inviting to &s;uch an attempt have offered; and the &s;cheme it&s;elf was not de&s;titute of &s;ome arguments not wholly unplau&s;ible to recommend it. The&s;e opportunities and the&s;e ar|guments, the u&s;e that has been made of both, the plan for carrying this new &s;cheme of government into execution, and the effects which it has produced, are in my opinion worthy of our &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty came to the throne of the&s;e kingdoms with more ad|vantages than any of his predece&s;&s;ors &s;ince the Revolution. Fourth in de&s;cent, and third in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his Royal family, even the zealots of hereditary right, in him, &s;aw &s;omething to flatter their favourite pre|judices; and to ju&s;tify a transfer of their attachments, without a change in their principles. The per&s;on and cau&s;e of the Pretender were become contemptible; his title di&s;owned throughout Europe, his party di&s;|banded in England. His Maje&s;ty came indeed to the inheritance of a mighty war; but, victorious in every part of the globe, peace was always in his power, not to negociate, but to dictate. No foreign habitudes or attachments withdrew him from the cultivation of his power at home. His revenue for the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, fixed (as it was then thought) at a large, but definite &s;um, was ample, without being invidious. His influence, by additions from conque&s;ts, by an augmentation of debt, by an increa&s;e of military and naval e&s;tabli&s;hment, much &s;trengthened and ex|tended. And coming to the throne in the prime and full vigour of youth, as from affection there was a &s;trong di&s;like, &s;o from dread there &s;eemed to be a general aver&s;ene&s;s, from giving any thing like offence to a Monarch, again&s;t who&s;e re&s;entment oppo&s;ition could not look for a refuge in any &s;ort of rever&s;ionary hope.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ingular advantages in&s;pired his Maje&s;ty only with a more ardent de&s;ire to pre&s;erve unimpaired the &s;pirit of that national freedom, to which he owed a &s;ituation &s;o full of glory. But to others it &s;ugge&s;ted &s;entiments of a very different nature. They thought they now beheld an opportunity (by a certain &s;ort of State&s;men never long undi&s;covered or unemployed) of drawing to them&s;elves, by the aggrandi&s;ement of a Court faction, a degree of power which they could never hope to derive from natural influence or from honourable &s;ervice; and which it was impo&s;&s;i|ble they could hold with the lea&s;t &s;ecurity, whil&s;t the &s;y&s;tem of Admini&s;|tration re&s;ted upon its former bottom. In order to facilitate the execu|tion of their de&s;ign, it was nece&s;&s;ary to make many alterations in political arrangement, and a &s;ignal change in the opinions, habits, and connexions of the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who acted then in publick.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
In the fir&s;t place, they proceeded gradually, but not &s;lowly, to de&s;troy every thing of &s;trength which did not derive its principal nouri&s;hment from the immediate plea&s;ure of the Court. The greate&s;t weight of popular opinion and party connexion were then with the Duke of Newca&s;tle and Mr. Pitt. Neither of the&s;e held their importance by the <HI>new tenure</HI> of the Court; they were not therefore thought to be &s;o proper as others for the &s;ervices which were required by that tenure. It hap|pened very favourably for the new &s;y&s;tem, that under a forced coalition there rankled an incurable alienation and di&s;gu&s;t between the parties which compo&s;ed the Admini&s;tration. Mr. Pitt was fir&s;t attacked. Not &s;atisfied with removing him from power, they endeavoured by various artifices to ruin his character. The other party &s;eemed rather plea&s;ed to get rid of &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive a &s;upport; not perceiving, that their own fall was prepared by his, and involved in it. Many other rea&s;ons prevented them from daring to look their true &s;ituation in the face. To the great Whig families it was extremely di&s;agreeable, and &s;eemed almo&s;t unna|tural, to oppo&s;e the Admini&s;tration of a Prince of the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick. Day after day they he&s;itated, and doubted, and lingered, expecting that other coun&s;els would take place; and were &s;low to be per&s;uaded, that all which had been done by the cabal, was the effect not of humour, but of &s;y&s;tem. It was more &s;trongly and evidently the intere&s;t of the new Court faction, to get rid of the great Whig connexions, than to de&s;troy Mr. Pitt. The power of that gentleman was va&s;t indeed and merited; but it was in a great degree per&s;onal, and therefore tran&s;ient. Theirs was rooted in the country. For, with a good deal le&s;s of popularity, they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a far more natural and fixed influence. Long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Government, va&s;t property, obligations of favours given and re|ceived, connexion of office, ties of blood, of alliance, of friend&s;hip (things at that time &s;uppo&s;ed of &s;ome force), the name of Whig, dear to the majority of the people, the zeal early begun and &s;teadily continued to the Royal Family; all the&s;e together formed a body of power in the nation, which was criminal and devoted. The great ruling prin|ciple of the cabal, and that which animated and harmonized all their proceedings, how various &s;oever they may have been, was to &s;ignify to the world, that the Court would proceed upon its own proper forces only; and that the pretence of bringing any other into its &s;ervice was an affront to it, and not a &s;upport. Therefore, when the chiefs were re|moved, in order to go to the root, the whole party was put under a pro|&s;cription, &s;o general and &s;evere as to take their hard-earned bread from the lowe&s;t officers, in a manner which had never been known before, even in general revolutions. But it was thought nece&s;&s;ary effectually to de&s;troy all dependencies but one; and to &s;hew an example of the firm|ne&s;s and rigour with which the new &s;y&s;tem was to be &s;upported.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">
Thus for the time were pulled down, in the per&s;ons of the Whig leaders and of Mr. Pitt (in &s;pite of the &s;ervices of the one at the acce&s;&s;ion of the Royal Family, and the recent &s;ervices of the other in the war), the <HI>two only &s;ecurities for the importance of the people; power ari&s;ing from popularity; and power ari&s;ing from connexion.</HI> Here and there indeed a few individuals were left &s;tanding, who gave &s;ecurity for their total e&s;trangement from the odious principles of party connexion and per&s;onal attachment; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that mo&s;t of them have religiou&s;ly kept their faith. Such a change could not however be made without a mighty &s;hock to Government.</P>
<P>To reconcile the minds of the people to all the&s;e movements, principles corre&s;pondent to them had been preached up with great zeal. Every one mu&s;t remember that the cabal &s;et out with the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing prudery, both moral and political. Tho&s;e who in a few months after &s;ou&s;ed over head and ears into the deepe&s;t and dirtie&s;t pits of corruption, cried out violently again&s;t the indirect practices in the electing and managing of Parliaments, which had formerly prevailed. This marvellous abhorrence which the Court had &s;uddenly taken to all influence, was not only circulated in conver&s;ation through the kingdom, but pompou&s;ly announced to the publick, with many other extraordinary things, in a pamphlet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sentiments of an hone&s;t Man.</NOTE> which had all the appearance of a manife&s;to preparatory to &s;ome con&s;iderable enterprize. Throughout, it was a &s;atire, though in terms managed and decent enough, on the politicks of the former Reign. It was indeed written with no &s;mall art and addre&s;s.</P>
<P>In this piece appeared the fir&s;t dawning of the new &s;y&s;tem; there fir&s;t appeared the idea (then only in &s;peculation) of <HI>&s;eparating the Court from the Admini&s;tration;</HI> of carrying every thing from national connexion to per&s;onal regards; and of forming a regular party for that purpo&s;e, under the name of <HI>King's men.</HI></P>
<P>To recommend this &s;y&s;tem to the people, a per&s;pective view of the Court gorgeou&s;ly painted, and finely illuminated from within, was exhibited to the gaping multitude. Party was to be totally done away, with all its evil works. Corruption was to be ca&s;t down from Court, as <HI>At&egrave;</HI> was from heaven. Power was thenceforward to be the cho&s;en re&s;idence of public &s;pirit; and no one was to be &s;uppo&s;ed under any &s;ini&s;ter influence, except tho&s;e who had the misfortune to be in di&s;grance at Court, which was to &s;tand in lieu of all vices and all corruptions. A &s;cheme of perfection to be realized in a monarchy far beyond the vi&s;ionary republick of Plato. The whole &s;cenery was ex|actly di&s;po&s;ed to captivate tho&s;e good &s;ouls, who&s;e credulous morality is &s;o invaluable a trea&s;ure to crafty politicians. Indeed there was where|withall
<PB N="13" REF="14">
to charm every body, except tho&s;e few who are not much plea&s;ed with profe&s;&s;ions of &s;upernatural virtue, who know of what &s;tuff &s;uch profe&s;&s;ions are made, for what purpo&s;es they are de&s;igned, and in what they are &s;ure con&s;tantly to end. Many innocent gentlemen, who had been talking pro&s;e all their lives without knowing any thing of the matter, began at la&s;t to open their eyes upon their own merits, and to at|tribute their not having been Lords of the Trea&s;ury and Lords of Trade many years before merely to the prevalence of party, and to the Mini&s;terial power, which had fru&s;trated the good intentions of the Court in favour of their abilities. Now was the time to unlock the &s;ealed fountain of Royal bounty, which had been infamou&s;ly monopolized and huck&s;tered, and to let it flow at large upon the whole people. The time was come, to re&s;tore Royalty to its original &s;plendour. <HI>Mettre le Roy hors de page,</HI> became a &s;ort of watch-word. And it was con&s;tantly in the mouths of all the runners of the Court, that nothing could pre&s;erve the balance of the con&s;titution from being overturned by the rabble, or by a faction of the nobility, but to free the Sovereign effectually from that Mini&s;terial tyranny under which the Royal dignity had been oppre&s;&s;ed in the per|&s;on of his Maje&s;ty's grand-father.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;ome of the many artifices u&s;ed to reconcile the people to the great change which was made in the per&s;ons who compo&s;ed the Mini&s;try, and the &s;till greater which was made and avowed in its con|&s;titution. As to individuals, other methods were employed with them; in order &s;o thoroughly to di&s;unite every party, and even every family, that <HI>no concert, order, or effect, might appear in any future oppo&s;ition.</HI> And in this manner an Admini&s;tration without connexion with the people. or with one another, was fir&s;t put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Government. What good effects followed from it, we have all &s;een; whether with regard to virtue, public or private; to the ea&s;e and happine&s;s of the Sovereign; or to the real &s;trength of Government. But as &s;o much &s;tre&s;s was then laid on the nece&s;&s;ity of this new project, it will not be ami&s;s to take a view of the effects of this Royal &s;ervitude and vile durance, which was &s;o deplored in the reign of the late Monarch, and was &s;o carefully to be avoided in the reign of his Succe&s;&s;or. The effects were the&s;e.</P>
<P>In times full of doubt and danger to his per&s;on and family, George the Second maintained the dignity of his Crown connected with the liberty of his people, not only unimpaired, but improved, for the &s;pace of thirty three years. He overcame a dangerous rebellion, abetted by foreign force, and raging in the heart of his kingdoms; and thereby de&s;troyed the &s;eeds of all future rebellion that could ari&s;e upon the &s;ame principle. He carried the glory, the power, the commerce of England, to an height unknown even to this renowned nation in the times of its greate&s;t pro&s;pe|rity;
<PB N="14" REF="15">
and he left his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion re&s;ting on the true and only true founda|tions of all national and all regal greatne&s;s; affection at home, reputation abroad, tru&s;t in allies, terror in rival nations. The mo&s;t ardent lover of his country cannot wi&s;h for Great Britain an happier fate than to continue as &s;he was then left. A people emulous as we are in affection to our pre|&s;ent Sovereign, know not how to form a prayer to Heaven for a greater ble&s;&s;ing upon his virtues, or an higher &s;tate of felicity and glory, than that, that he &s;hould live, and &s;hould reign, and, when Providence ordains it, &s;hould die, exactly like his illu&s;trious Predece&s;&s;er.</P>
<P>A great Prince may be obliged (though &s;uch a thing cannot happen very often) to &s;acrifice his private inclination to his public intere&s;t. A wi&s;e Prince will not think that &s;uch a re&s;traint implies a condition of &s;ervility; and truly if &s;uch was the condition of the la&s;t reign, and the effects were al&s;o &s;uch as we have de&s;cribed, we ought, no le&s;s for the &s;ake of the Sovereign whom we love, than for our own, to hear arguments con|vincing indeed, before we depart from the maxims of that reign, or fly in the face of this great body of &s;trong and recent experience.</P>
<P>One of the principal topicks which was then, and has been &s;ince much employed by that political <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See the Political Writings of the late Dr. Brown, and many others.</NOTE> &s;chool, is an affected terror of the growth of an ari&s;tocratic power, prejudicial to the rights of the Crown, and the balance of the con&s;titution. Any new powers exerci&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, or in the Hou&s;e of Commons, or by the Crown, ought certainly to excite the vigilant and anxious jealou&s;y of a free people. Even a new and unprecedented cour&s;e of action in the whole Legi&s;lature, without great and evident rea&s;on, may be a &s;ubject of ju&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s. I will not affirm, that there may not have lately appeared in the Hou&s;e of Lords a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ome attempts derogatory to the legal rights of the &s;ubject. If any &s;uch have really appeared, they have ari&s;en, not from a power properly ari&s;tocratic, but from the &s;ame influence which is charged with having excited attempts of a &s;imilar nature in the Hou&s;e of Commons; which Hou&s;e, if it &s;hould have been betrayed into an unfortunate quarrel with its con&s;tituents, and involved in a charge of the very &s;ame nature, could have neither power nor inclination to repell &s;uch attempts in others. Tho&s;e attempts in the Hou&s;e of Lords can no more be called ari&s;tocratic proceedings, than the proceedings with regard to the county of Middle&s;ex in the Hou&s;e of Commons can with any &s;en&s;e be called democratical.</P>
<P>It is true, that the Peers have a great influence in the kingdom, and in every part of the public concerns. While they are men of property, it is impo&s;&s;ible to prevent it, except by &s;uch means as mu&s;t prevent all property from its natural operation; an event not ea&s;ily to be compa&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
while property is power; or by any means to be wi&s;hed, while the lea&s;t notion exi&s;ts of the method by which the &s;pirit of liberty acts, and of the means by which it is pre&s;erved. If any particular Peers, by their uni|form, upright, con&s;titutional conduct, by their public and their private virtues, have acquired an influence in the country; the people, on who&s;e favour that influence depends, and from whom it aro&s;e, will never be duped into an opinion, that &s;uch greatne&s;s in a Peer is the de&s;poti&s;m of an ari&s;tocracy, when they know and feel it to be the effect and pledge of their own importance.</P>
<P>I am no friend to ari&s;tocracy, in the &s;en&s;e at lea&s;t in which that word is u&s;ually under&s;tood. If it were not a bad habit to moot ca&s;es on the &s;up|po&s;ed ruin of the con&s;titution, I &s;hould be free to declare, that if it mu&s;t peri&s;h, I would rather by far &s;ee it re&s;olved into any other form, than lo&s;t in that au&s;tere and in&s;olent domination. But, whatever my di&s;likes may be, my fears are not upon that quarter. The que&s;tion, on the influence of a Court, and of a Peerage, is not, which of the two dangers is the mo&s;t eligible, but which is the mo&s;t imminent. He is but a poor ob&s;erver, who has not &s;een, that the generality of Peers, far from &s;upporting them&s;elves in a &s;tate of independent greatne&s;s, are but too apt to fall into an oblivion of their proper dignity, and to run headlong into an abject &s;ervitude. Would to God it were true, that the fault of our Peers were too much &s;pirit! It is worthy of &s;ome ob&s;erva|tion, that the&s;e gentlemen, &s;o jealous of ari&s;tocracy, make no com|plaints of the power of tho&s;e Peers (neither few nor incon&s;iderable) who are always in the train of a Court, and who&s;e whole weight mu&s;t be con|&s;idered as a portion of the &s;ettled influence of the Crown. This is all &s;afe and right: but if &s;ome Peers (I am very &s;orry they are not as many as they ought to be) &s;et them&s;elves, in the great concern of Peers and Commons, again&s;t a back-&s;tairs influence, and clande&s;tine government, then the alarm begins; then the con&s;titution is in danger of being forced into an ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>I re&s;t a little the longer on this Court topick, becau&s;e it was much in|&s;i&s;ted upon at the time of the great change, and has been &s;ince frequently revived by many of the agents of that party: for, whil&s;t they are terrifying the great and opulent with the horrors of mob-government, they are by other managers attempting (though hitherto with little &s;ucce&s;s) to alarm the people with the phantom of the tyranny of the Nobles. All this is done upon their favourite principle of di&s;union, of &s;owing jealou&s;ies among&s;t the different orders of the State, and of disjointing the natural &s;trength of the kingdom; that it may be rendered incapable of re&s;i&s;ting the &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns of wicked men, who have engro&s;&s;ed the Royal power.</P>
<P>Thus much of the topicks cho&s;en by the Courtiers to recommend their &s;y&s;tem; it will be nece&s;&s;ary to open a little more at large the nature of
<PB N="16" REF="17">
that party which was formed for its &s;upport. Without this, the whole would have been no better than a vi&s;ionary amu&s;ement, like the &s;cheme of Harrington's political club, and not a bu&s;ine&s;s in which the nation had a real concern. As a powerful party, and a party con&s;tructed on a new principle, it is a very inviting object of curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remembered, that &s;ince the Revolution, until the period we are &s;peaking of, the influence of the Crown had been always employed in &s;upporting the Mini&s;ters of State, and in carrying on the public bu&s;i|ne&s;s according to their opinions. But the party now in que&s;tion is formed upon a very different idea. It is to intercept the favour, protection and confidence of the Crown in the pa&s;&s;age to its Mini&s;ters; it is to come between them and their importance in Parliament; it is to &s;eparate them from all their natural and acquired dependencies; it is intended as the controul, not the &s;upport, of Admini&s;tration. The machinery of this &s;y&s;|tem is perplexed in its movements, and fal&s;e in its principle. It is form|ed on a &s;uppo&s;ition that the King is &s;omething external to his govern|ment; and that he may be honoured and aggrandized, even by its debi|lity and di&s;grace. The plan proceeds expre&s;sly on the idea of enfeebling the regular executory power. It proceeds on the idea of weakening the State in order to &s;trengthen the Court. The &s;cheme depending intirely on di&s;tru&s;t, on di&s;connection, on mutability by principle, on &s;y&s;tematic weakne&s;s in every particular member; it is impo&s;&s;ible that the total re&s;ult &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tantial &s;trength of any kind.</P>
<P>As a foundation of their &s;cheme, the Cabal have e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ort of <HI>Rota</HI> in the Court. All &s;orts of parties, by this means, have been brought into Admini&s;tration, from whence few have had the good fortune to e&s;cape without di&s;grace; none at all without con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es. In the begin|ning of each arrangement no profe&s;&s;ions of confidence and &s;upport are wanting, to induce the leading men to engage. But while the Mini&s;ters of the day appear in all the pomp and pride of power, while they have all their canvas &s;pread out to the wind, and every &s;ail filled with the fair and pro&s;perous gale of royal favour, in a &s;hort time they find, they know not how, a current, which &s;ets directly again&s;t them; which prevents all progre&s;s; and even drives them backwards. They grow a&s;hamed and mortified in a &s;ituation, which, by its vicinity to power, only &s;erves to remind them the more &s;trongly of their in&s;ignificance. They are obliged either to execute the orders of their inferiors, or to &s;ee them&s;elves op|po&s;ed by the natural in&s;truments of their office. With the lo&s;s of their dignity, they lo&s;e their temper. In their turn they grow trouble&s;ome to that Cabal, which, whether it &s;upports or oppo&s;es, equally di&s;graces and equally betrays them. It is &s;oon found nece&s;&s;ary to get rid of the heads of Admini&s;tration; but it is of the heads only. As there always are
<PB N="17" REF="18">
many rotten members belonging to the be&s;t connexions, it is not hard to per&s;uade &s;everal to continue in office without their leaders. By this means the party goes out much thinner than it came in; and is only reduced in &s;trength by its temporary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power. Be&s;ides, if by accident, or in cour&s;e of changes, that power &s;hould be recovered, the Junto have thrown up a retrenchment of the&s;e carca&s;es, which may &s;erve to cover them&s;elves in a day of danger. They conclude, not unwi&s;ely, that &s;uch rotten members will become the fir&s;t objects of di&s;gu&s;t and re&s;entment to their antient connexions.</P>
<P>They contrive to form in the outward Admini&s;tration two parties at the lea&s;t; which, whil&s;t they are tearing one another to pieces, are both competitors for the favour and protection of the Cabal; and, by their emulation, contribute to throw every thing more and more into the hands of the interior managers.</P>
<P>A Mini&s;ter of State will &s;ometimes keep him&s;elf totally e&s;tranged from all his collegues; will differ from them in their councils, will privately traver&s;e, and publicly oppo&s;e, their mea&s;ures. He will, how|ever, continue in his employment. In&s;tead of &s;uffering any mark of di&s;plea&s;ure, he will be di&s;tingui&s;hed by an unbounded profu&s;ion of Court rewards and care&s;&s;es; becau&s;e he does what is expected, and all that is expected, from men in office. He helps to keep &s;o me form of Admi|ni&s;tration in being, and keeps it at the &s;ame time as weak and divided as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>However, we mu&s;t take care not to be mi&s;taken, or to imagine that &s;uch per&s;ons have any weight in their oppo&s;ition. When, by them, Admi|ni&s;tration is convinced of its in&s;ignificancy, they are &s;oon to be convinced of their own. They never are &s;uffered to &s;ucceed in their oppo&s;ition. They and the world are to be &s;atisfied, that, neither office, nor authority, nor property, nor ability, eloquence, council, &s;kill, or union, are of the lea&s;t importance; but that the mere influence of the Court, naked of all &s;upport, and de&s;titute of all management, is abundantly &s;ufficient for all its own purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>When any adver&s;e connexion is to be de&s;troyed, the Cabal &s;eldom ap|pear in the work them&s;elves. They find out &s;ome per&s;on of whom the party entertains an high opinion. Such a per&s;on they endeavour to de|lude with various pretences. They teach him fir&s;t to di&s;tru&s;t, and then to quarrel with his friends; among whom, by the &s;ame arts, they excite a &s;imilar diffidence of him; &s;o that, in this mutual fear and di&s;tru&s;t, he may &s;uffer him&s;elf to be employed as the in&s;trument in the change which is brought about. Afterwards they are &s;ure to de&s;troy him in his turn; by &s;etting up in his place &s;ome per&s;on in whom he had him&s;elf re|po&s;ed
<PB N="18" REF="19">
the greate&s;t confidence, and who &s;erves to carry off a con&s;iderable part of his adherents.</P>
<P>When &s;uch a per&s;on has broke in this manner with his connexions, he is &s;oon compelled to commit &s;ome flagrant act of iniquitous per&s;onal ho&s;tility again&s;t &s;ome of them (&s;uch as an attempt to &s;trip a particular friend of his family e&s;tate), by which the cabal hope to render the parties utterly irreconcilable. In truth, they have &s;o contrived mat|ters, that people have a greater hatred to the &s;ubordinate in&s;truments than to the principal movers.</P>
<P>As in de&s;troying their enemies they make u&s;e of in&s;truments not im|mediately belonging to their corps, &s;o, in advancing their own friends, they pur&s;ue exactly the &s;ame method. To promote any of them to con&s;ider|able rank or emolument, they commonly take care that the recom|mendation &s;hall pa&s;s through the hands of the o&s;ten&s;ible mini&s;try: &s;uch a recommendation might however appear to the world, as &s;ome proof of the credit of Mini&s;ters, and &s;ome means of encrea&s;ing their &s;trength. To prevent this, the per&s;ons &s;o advanced are directed, in all companies indu&s;triou&s;ly to declare, that they are under no obligations what&s;oever to Admini&s;tration; that they have received their office from another quarter; that they are totally free and independent.</P>
<P>When the faction has any job of lucre to obtain, or of vengeance to per|petrate, their way is, to &s;elect, for the execution, tho&s;e very per&s;ons to who&s;e habits, friend&s;hips, principles, and declarations, &s;uch proceedings are publicly known to be the mo&s;t adver&s;e; at once to render the in&s;tru|ments more odious, and therefore the more dependent, and to prevent the people from ever repo&s;ing a confidence in any appearance of private friend&s;hip, or public principle.</P>
<P>If the Admini&s;tration &s;eem now and then, from remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, or from &s;ear of making them&s;elves di&s;agreeable, to &s;uffer any popular exce&s;&s;es to go unpuni&s;hed, the cabal immediately &s;ets up &s;ome creature of theirs to rai&s;e a clamour again&s;t the Mini&s;ters, as having &s;hamefully betrayed the dignity of Government. Then they compel the Mini&s;try to become active in con&s;erring rewards and honours on the per&s;ons who have been the in|&s;truments of their di&s;grace; and, after having fir&s;t vilified them with the higher orders for &s;uffering the laws to &s;leep over the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the populace, they drive them (in order to make amends for their former inactivity) to &s;ome act of atrocious violence, which renders them com|pletely abhorred by the people. They who remember the riots which attended the Middle&s;ex Election; the opening of the pre&s;ent Parliament; and the tran&s;actions relative to Saint George's Fields, will not be at a lo&s;s for an application of the&s;e remarks.</P>

That this body may be enabled to compa&s;s all the ends of its in&s;titution, its members are &s;carcely ever to aim at the high and re&s;pon&s;ible offices of the State. They are di&s;tributed with art and judgement through all the &s;econdary, but efficient, departments of office, and through the hou&s;e|holds of all the branches of the Royal Family: &s;o as on one hand to occupy all the avenues to the Throne; and on the other to forward or fru&s;trate the execution of any mea&s;ure, according to their own intere&s;ts. For with the credit and &s;upport which they are known to have, though for the greater part in places which are only a genteel excu&s;e for &s;alary, they po&s;&s;e&s;s all the influence of the highe&s;t po&s;ts; and they dictate pub|licly in almo&s;t every thing, even with a parade of &s;uperiority. Whenever they di&s;&s;ent (as it often happens) from their nominal leaders, the trained part of the Senate, in&s;tinctively in the &s;ecret, is &s;ure to follow them; provided the leaders, &s;en&s;ible of their &s;ituation, do not of them&s;elves re|cede in time from their mo&s;t declared opinions. This latter is generally the ca&s;e. It will not be conceivable to any who has not &s;een it, what plea|&s;ure is taken by the cabal in rendering the&s;e heads of office thoroughly contemptible and ridiculous. And when they are become &s;o, they have then the be&s;t chance for being well &s;upported.</P>
<P>The members of the court faction are fully indemnified for not holding places on the &s;lippery heights of the kingdom, not only by the lead in all affairs, but al&s;o by the perfect &s;ecurity in which they enjoy le&s;s con&s;pi|cuous, but very advantageous &s;ituations. Their places are, in expres&s; legal tenure, or in effect, all of them for life. Whil&s;t the fir&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;ons in the kingdom are to&s;&s;ed about like tennis balls, the &s;port of a blind and in&s;olent caprice, no mini&s;ter dares even to ca&s;t an ob|lique glance at the lowe&s;t of their body. If an attempt be made upon one of this corps, immediately he flies to &s;anctuary, and pretends to the mo&s;t inviolable of all promi&s;es. No conveniency of public arrangement is a|vailable to remove any of them from the &s;pecific &s;ituation he holds; and the &s;lighte&s;t attempt upon one of them, by the mo&s;t powerful Mini&s;ter, is a certain preliminary to his own de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious of their independence, they bear them&s;elves with a lo&s;ty air to the exterior Mini&s;ters. Like Jani&s;&s;aries, they derive a kind of free|dom from the very condition of their &s;ervitude. They may act ju&s;t as they plea&s;e; provided they are true to the great ruling principle of their in&s;titution. It is, therefore, not at all wonderful, that people &s;hould be &s;o de&s;irous of adding them&s;elves to that body, in which they may po&s;&s;e&s;s and reconcile &s;atisfactions the mo&s;t alluring, and &s;eemingly the mo&s;t con|tradictory; enjoying at once all the &s;pirited plea&s;ure of independence, and all the gro&s;s lucre and fat emoluments of &s;ervitude.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21">
Here is a &s;ketch, though a &s;light one, of the con&s;titution, laws, and po|licy, of this new Court corporation. The name by which they chu&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, is that of <HI>King's men,</HI> or the <HI>King's friends,</HI> by an invidious exclu&s;ion of the re&s;t of his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t loyal and affection|ate &s;ubjects. The whole &s;y&s;tem, comprehending the exterior and interior Admini&s;trations, is commonly called, in the technical language of the Court, <HI>Double Cabinet;</HI> in French or Engli&s;h, as you choo&s;e to pro|nounce it.</P>
<P>Whether all this be a vi&s;ion of a di&s;tracted brain, or the invention of a malicious heart, or a real faction in the country, mu&s;t be judged by the appearances which things have worn for eight years pa&s;t. Thus far I am certain, that there is not a &s;ingle public man, in or out of office, who has not, at &s;ome time or other, born te&s;timony to the truth of what I have now related. In particular, no per&s;ons have been more &s;trong in their a&s;|&s;ertions, and louder and more indecent in their complaints, than tho&s;e who compo&s;e all the exterior part of the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration; in who&s;e time that faction has arrived at &s;uch an height of power, and of boldne&s;s in the u&s;e of it, as may, in the end, perhaps bring about its total de&s;truction.</P>
<P>It is true, that about four years ago, during the admini&s;tration of the Marquis of Rockingham, an attempt was made to carry on Government without their concurrence. However, this was only a tran&s;ient cloud; they were hid but for a moment; and their con&s;tellation blazed out with greater brightne&s;s, and a far more vigorous influence, &s;ome time after it was blown over. An attempt was at that time made (but without any idea of pro&s;cription) to break their corps, to di&s;countenance their doctrines, to revive connexions of a different kind, to re&s;tore the principles and policy of the Whigs, to reanimate the cau&s;e of Liberty by Mini&s;terial counte|nance; and then for the fir&s;t time were men &s;een attached in office to every principle they had maintained in oppo&s;ition. No one will doubt, that &s;uch men were abhorred and violently oppo&s;ed by the Court faction, and that &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem could have but a &s;hort duration.</P>
<P>It may appear &s;omewhat affected, that in &s;o much di&s;cour&s;e upon this extraordinary party, I &s;hould &s;ay &s;o little of the Earl of Bute, who is the &s;uppo&s;ed head of it. But this was neither owing to affectation nor inadvertence. I have carefully avoided the introduction of per&s;onal reflexions of any kind. Much the greater part of the topicks which have been u&s;ed to blacken this Nobleman, are either unju&s;t or frivolous. At be&s;t, they have a tendency to give the re&s;entment of this bitter cala|mity a wrong direction, and to turn a public grievance into a mean per&s;onal, or a dangerous national quarrel. Where there is a regular &s;cheme of operations carried on, it is the &s;y&s;tem, and not any individual
<PB N="21" REF="22">
per&s;on who acts in it, that is truly dangerous. This &s;y&s;tem has not ri&s;en &s;olely from the ambition of Lord Bute, but from the circum&s;tances which favoured it, and from an indifference to the con&s;titution which had been for &s;ome time growing among our gentry. We &s;hould have been tried with it, if the Earl of Bute had never exi&s;ted; and it will want neither a con|triving head nor active members, when the Earl of Bute exi&s;ts no longer. It is not, therefore, to rail at Lord Bute, but firmly to embody again&s;t this Court party and its practices, which can afford us any pro&s;pect of relief in our pre&s;ent condition.</P>
<P>Another motive induces me to put the per&s;onal con&s;ideration of Lord Bute wholly out of the que&s;tion. He communicates very little in a di|rect manner with the greater part of our men of bu&s;ine&s;s. This has never been his cu&s;tom. It is enough for him that he &s;urrounds them with his creatures. Several imagine therefore, that they have a very good excu&s;e for doing all the work of this faction, when they have no per&s;onal con|nexion with Lord Bute. But whoever becomes a party to an Admini|&s;tration, compo&s;ed of in&s;ulated individuals, without faith plighted, tie, or common principle; an Admini&s;tration con&s;titutionally impotent, be|cau&s;e &s;upported by no party in the nation; he who contributes to de&s;troy the connexions of men and their tru&s;t in one another, or in any &s;ort to throw the dependence of public coun&s;els upon private will and favour, po&s;&s;ibly may have nothing to do with the Earl of Bute. It matters little whether he be the friend or the enemy of that particular per&s;on. But let him be who or what he will, he abets a faction that is driving hard to the ruin of his country. He is &s;apping the foundation of its liberty, di&s;turbing the &s;ources of its dome&s;tic tranquillity, weakening its government over its depen|dencies, degrading it from all its importance in the &s;y&s;tem of Europe.</P>
<P>It is this unnatural infu&s;ion of a <HI>&s;y&s;tem of Favouriti&s;m</HI> into a Govern|ment which in a great part of its con&s;titution is popular, that has rai&s;ed the pre&s;ent ferment in the nation. The people without entering deeply into its principles could plainly perceive its effects, in much violence, in a great &s;pirit of innovation, and a general di&s;order in all the functions of Government. I keep my eye &s;olely on this &s;y&s;tem; if I &s;peak of tho&s;e mea&s;ures which have ari&s;en from it, it will be &s;o far only as they illu&s;trate the general &s;cheme. This is the fountain of all tho&s;e bitter waters of which, through an hundred different conduits, we have drunk until we are ready to bur&s;t. The di&s;cretionary power of the Crown in the formation of Mini&s;try, abu&s;ed by bad or weak men, has given ri&s;e to a &s;y&s;tem, which, without directly violating the letter of any law, ope|rates again&s;t the &s;pirit of the whole con&s;titution.</P>
<P>A plan of Favouriti&s;m for our executory Government is e&s;&s;entially at variance with the plan of our Legi&s;lature. One great end undoubtedly of
<PB N="22" REF="23">
a mixed Government like ours, compo&s;ed of Monarchy, and of controls, on the part of the higher people and the lower, is that the Prince &s;hall not be able to violate the laws. This is u&s;eful indeed and funda|mental. But this, even at fir&s;t view, is no more than a negative advantage; an armour merely defen&s;ive. It is therefore next in order, and equal in importance, <HI>that the di&s;cretionary powers which are nece&s;&s;arily ve&s;ted in the Monarch, whether for the execution of the laws, or for the nomination to magi&s;tracy and office, or for conducting the affairs of peace and war, or for ordering the revenue, &s;hould all be exerci&s;ed upon public principles and national grounds, and not on the likings or prejudices, the intrigues or policies of a Court.</HI> This, I &s;aid, is equal in importance to the &s;ecuring a Government according to law. The laws reach but a very little way. Con&s;titute Government how you plea&s;e, infinitely the greater part of it mu&s;t depend upon the exerci&s;e of the powers which are left at large to the prudence and uprightne&s;s of Mini&s;ters of State. Even all the u&s;e and potency of the laws depends upon them. Without them, your Com|monwealth is no better than a &s;cheme upon paper; and not a living, acting, effective con&s;titution. It is po&s;&s;ible, that through negligence, or ignorance, or de&s;ign artfully conducted, Mini&s;ters may &s;uffer one part of Government to langui&s;h, another to be perverted from its purpo&s;es, and every valuable intere&s;t of the country to fall into ruin and decay, without po&s;&s;ibility of fixing any &s;ingle act on which a criminal pro&s;ecution can be ju&s;tly grounded. The due arrangement of men in the active part of the &s;tate, far from being foreign to the purpo&s;es of a wi&s;e Govern|ment, ought to be among its very fir&s;t and deare&s;t objects. When, there|fore, the abettors of the new &s;y&s;tem tell us, that between them and their oppo&s;ers there is nothing but a &s;truggle for power, and that therefore we are noways concerned in it; we mu&s;t tell tho&s;e who have the impudence to in&s;ult us in this manner, that of all things we ought to be the mo&s;t concerned, who and what &s;ort of men they are, that hold the tru&s;t of every thing that is dear to us. Nothing can render this a point of indifference to the nation, but what mu&s;t either render us totally de&s;perate, or &s;ooth us into the &s;ecurity of ideots. We mu&s;t &s;often into a credulity below the milkine&s;s of infancy, to think all men virtuous. We mu&s;t be tainted with a malignity truly diabolical, to believe all the world to be equally wicked and corrupt. Men are in public life as in private, &s;ome good, &s;ome evil. The elevation of the one, and the depre&s;&s;ion of the other, are the fir&s;t objects of all true policy. But that form of Government, which, nei|ther in its direct in&s;titutions, nor in their immediate tendency, has con|trived to throw its affairs into the mo&s;t tru&s;t-worthy hands, but has left its whole executory &s;y&s;tem to be di&s;po&s;ed of agreeably to the uncontrolled
<PB N="23" REF="24">
plea&s;ure of any one man, however excellent or virtuous, is a plan of po|lity defective not only in that member, but con&s;equentially erroneous in every part of it.</P>
<P>In arbitrary Governments, the con&s;titution of the Mini&s;try follows the con&s;titution of the Legi&s;lature. Both the law and the magi&s;trate are the creatures of Will. It mu&s;t be &s;o. Nothing, indeed, will appear more certain, on any tolerable con&s;ideration of this matter, than that <HI>every &s;ort of Government ought to have its Admini&s;tration corre&s;pon|dent to its Legi&s;lature.</HI> If it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, things mu&s;t fall into an hideous di&s;order. The people of a free commonwealth, who have taken &s;uch care that their laws &s;hould be the re&s;ult of general con&s;ent, cannot be &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s as to &s;uffer their executory &s;y&s;tem to be compo&s;ed of per&s;ons on whom they have no dependence, and whom no proofs of the public love and confidence have recommended to tho&s;e powers, upon the u&s;e of which the very being of the State depends.</P>
<P>The popular election of magi&s;trates, and popular di&s;po&s;ition of rewards and honours, is one of the fir&s;t advantages of a free State. Without it, or &s;omething equivalent to it, perhaps the people cannot long enjoy the &s;ub&s;tance of freedom; certainly none of the vivifying energy of good Go|vernment. The frame of our Commonwealth did not admit of &s;uch an actual election: but it provided as well, and (while the &s;pirit of the con|&s;titution is pre&s;erved) better for all the effects of it than by the method of &s;uffrage in any democratic State what&s;oever. It had always, until of late, been held the fir&s;t duty of Parliament, <HI>to refu&s;e to &s;upport Government, until power was in the hands of per&s;ons who were acceptable to the people, or while factions predominated in the Court in which the nation had no confidence.</HI> Thus all the good effects of popular election were &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ecured to us, without the mi&s;chiefs attending on perpetual intrigue, and a di&s;tinct canva&s;s for every particular office throughout the body of the people. This was the mo&s;t noble and refined part of our con&s;titution. The people, by their repre&s;entatives and grandees, were intru&s;ted with a deliberative power in making laws; the King with the control of his negative. The King was intru&s;ted with the deliberative choice and the election to office; the people had the negative in a Parliamentary refu&s;al to &s;upport. Formerly this power of control was what kept Mini&s;ters in awe of Parliaments, and Parliaments in reverence with the people. If the u&s;e of this power of control on the &s;y&s;tem and per&s;ons of Admini&s;tration is gone, every thing is lo&s;t, Parliament and all. We may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that if Parliament will tamely &s;ee evil men take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the &s;trong-holds of their country, and allow them time and means to fortify them&s;elves, under a pretence of giving them a fair trial, and upon a hope of di&s;covering, whether they will not be reformed by power, and whether their mea&s;ures will
<PB N="24" REF="25">
not be better than their morals, &s;uch a Parliament will give countenance to their mea&s;ures al&s;o, whatever that Parliament may pretend, and whatever tho&s;e mea&s;ures may be.</P>
<P>Every good political in&s;titution mu&s;t have a preventive operation as well as a remedial. It ought to have a natural tendency to exclude bad men from Government, and not to tru&s;t for the &s;afety of the State to &s;ub&s;equent puni&s;hment alone: puni&s;hment, which has ever been tardy and uncer|tain; and which, when power is &s;uffered in bad hands, may chance to fall rather on the injured than the criminal.</P>
<P>Before men are put forward into the great tru&s;ts of the &s;tate, they ought by their conduct to have obtained &s;uch a degree of e&s;timation in their country, as may be &s;ome &s;ort of pledge and &s;ecurity to the publick, that they will not abu&s;e tho&s;e tru&s;ts. It is no mean &s;ecurity for a proper u&s;e of power, that a man has &s;hewn by the general tenor of his actions, that the affection, the good opinion, the confidence, of his fellow citizens have been among the principal objects of his life; and that he has owed none of the gradations of his power or fortune to a &s;ettled contempt, or occa&s;ional forfeiture of their e&s;teem.</P>
<P>That man who before he comes into power has no friends, or who coming into power is obliged to de&s;ert his friends, or who lo&s;ing it has no friends to &s;ympathize with him; he who has no &s;way among any part of the landed or commercial intere&s;t, but who&s;e whole importance has begun with his office, and is &s;ure to end with it; is a per&s;on who ought never to be &s;uffered by a controlling Parliament to continue in any of tho&s;e &s;ituations which confer the lead and direction of all our public affairs; becau&s;e &s;uch a man <HI>has no connexion with the intere&s;t of the people.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e knots or cabals of men who have got together, avowedly with|out any public principle, in order to &s;ell their conjunct iniquity at the higher rate, and are therefore univer&s;ally odious, ought never to be &s;uffered to domineer in the State; becau&s;e they have <HI>no connexion with the &s;entiments and opinions of the people.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are con&s;iderations which in my opinion enforce the nece&s;&s;ity of having &s;ome better rea&s;on, in a free country, and a free Parliament, for &s;up|porting the Mini&s;ters of the Crown, than that &s;hort one, <HI>That the King has thought proper to appoint them.</HI> There is &s;omething very courtly in this. But it is a principle pregnant with all &s;orts of mi&s;chief, in a con&s;ti|tution like ours, to turn the views of active men from the country to the Court. Whatever be the road to power, that is the road which will be trod. If the opinion of the country be of no u&s;e as a means of power or con|&s;ideration, the qualities which u&s;ually procure that opinion will be no longer cultivated. And whether it will be right in a &s;tate, &s;o popular in its
<PB N="25" REF="26">
con&s;titution as ours, to leave ambition without popular motives, and to tru&s;t all to the operation of pure virtue in the minds of Kings and Mini|&s;ters, and public men, mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to the judgement and good &s;en&s;e of the people of England.</P>
<P>Cunning men are here apt to break in, and, without directly con|troverting the principle, to rai&s;e objections from the difficulty under which the Sovereign labours, to di&s;tingui&s;h the genuine voice and &s;entiments of his people, from the clamour of a faction, by which it is &s;o ea&s;ily counterfeited. The nation, they &s;ay, is generally divided into parties, with views and pa&s;&s;ions utterly irreconcileable. If the King &s;hould put his affairs into the hands of any one of them, he is &s;ure to di&s;gu&s;t the re&s;t; if he &s;elect particular men from among them all, it is an hazard that he di&s;gu&s;ts them all. Tho&s;e who are left out, however divided before, will &s;oon run into a body of oppo&s;ition; which, being a collection of many di&s;contents into one focus, will without doubt be hot and violent enough. Faction will make its cries re&s;ound through the nation, as if the whole were in an uproar, when by far the majority, and much the better part, will &s;eem for a while as it were annihilated by the quiet, in which their virtue and moderation incline them to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of Government. Be&s;ides that the opinion of the meer vulgar is a mi&s;erable rule even with regard to them&s;elves, on account of their violence and in&s;tability. So that if you were to gratify them in their humour to-day, that very gratification would be a ground of their di&s;&s;atisfaction on the next. Now as all the&s;e rules of public opinion are to be collected with great difficulty, and to be applied with equal uncertainty as to the effect, what better can a King of England do, than to employ &s;uch men as he finds to have views and inclinations mo&s;t conformable to his own; who are lea&s;t infected with pride and &s;elf-will, and who are lea&s;t moved by &s;uch popular humours as are perpetually traver&s;ing his de&s;igns, and di&s;turbing his &s;ervice; tru&s;ting that, when he means no ill to his people, he will be &s;upported in his appointments, whether he choo&s;es to keep or to change, as his private judgement or his plea&s;ure leads him? He will find a &s;ure re&s;ource in the real weight and influence of the Crown, when it is not &s;uffered to become an in&s;trument in the hands of a faction.</P>
<P>I will not pretend to &s;ay that there is nothing at all in this mode of rea&s;oning; becau&s;e I will not a&s;&s;ert, that there is no difficulty in the art of Government. Undoubtedly the very be&s;t Admini&s;tration mu&s;t en|counter a great deal of oppo&s;ition; and the very wor&s;t will find more &s;up|port than it de&s;erves. Sufficient appearances will never be wanting to tho&s;e who have a mind to deceive them&s;elves. It is a fallacy in con&s;tant u&s;e with tho&s;e who would level all things, and confound right with wrong, to in&s;i&s;t upon the inconveniencies which are attached to every
<PB N="26" REF="27">
choice, without taking into con&s;ideration the different weight and con&s;e|quence of tho&s;e inconveniencies. The que&s;tion is not concerning <HI>ab&s;o|lute</HI> di&s;content or <HI>perfect</HI> &s;atisfaction in Government; neither of which can be pure and unmixed at any time, or upon any &s;y&s;tem. The con|trover&s;y is about that degree of good humour in the people, which may po&s;&s;ibly be attained, and ought certainly to be looked for. While &s;ome politicians may be waiting to know whether the &s;en&s;e of every individual be again&s;t them, accurately di&s;tingui&s;hing the vulgar from the better &s;ort, drawing lines between the enterprizes of a faction and the efforts of a people, they may chance to &s;ee the Government, which they are &s;o nicely weighing, and dividing, and di&s;tingui&s;hing, tumble to the ground in the mid&s;t of their wi&s;e deliberation. Prudent men, when &s;o great an object as the &s;ecurity of Government, or even its peace, is at &s;take, will not run the ri&s;que of a deci&s;ion which may be fatal to it. They who can read the political &s;ky will &s;ee an hurricane in a cloud no bigger than an hand at the very edge of the horizon, and will run into the fir&s;t harbour. No lines can be laid down for civil or political wi&s;dom. They are a matter incapable of exact definition. But, though no man can draw a &s;troke between the confines of day and night, yet light and darkne&s;s are upon the whole tolerably di&s;tingui&s;hable. Nor will it be impo&s;&s;ible for a Prince to find out &s;uch a mode of Government, and &s;uch per&s;ons to admini&s;ter it, as will give a great degree of content to his people; with|out any curious and anxious re&s;earch for that ab&s;tract, univer&s;al, perfect harmony, which while he is &s;eeking, he abandons tho&s;e means of ordi|nary tranquillity which are in his power without any re&s;earch at all.</P>
<P>It is not more the duty than it is the intere&s;t of a Prince, to aim at giv|ing tranquillity to his Government. But tho&s;e who advi&s;e him may have an intere&s;t in di&s;order and confu&s;ion. If the opinion of the people is again&s;t them, they will naturally wi&s;h that it &s;hould have no prevalence. Here it is that the people mu&s;t on their part &s;hew them&s;elves &s;en&s;ible of their own value. Their whole importance, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and afterwards their whole freedom, is at &s;take. Their freedom cannot long &s;urvive their importance. Here it is that the natural &s;trength of the king|dom, the great peers, the leading landed gentlemen, the opulent merchants and manufacturers, the &s;ub&s;tantial yeomanry, mu&s;t interpo&s;e, to re&s;cue their Prince, them&s;elves, and their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>We are at pre&s;ent at i&s;&s;ue upon this point. We are in the great cri&s;is of this contention; and the part which men take one way or other, will &s;erve to di&s;criminate their characters and their principles. Until the matter is decided, the country will remain in its pre&s;ent confu&s;ion. For while a &s;y&s;tem of Admini&s;tration is attempted, entirely repugnant to the genius of the people, and not conformable to the plan of their Government,
<PB N="27" REF="28">
every thing mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be di&s;ordered for a time, until this &s;y&s;tem de&s;troys the con&s;titution, or the con&s;titution gets the better of this &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>There is, in my opinion, a peculiar venom and malignity in this poli|tical di&s;temper beyond any that I have heard or read of. In former times the projectors of arbitrary Government attacked only the liberties of their country; a de&s;ign &s;urely mi&s;chievous enough to have &s;atisfied a mind of the mo&s;t unruly ambition. But a &s;y&s;tem unfavourable to freedom may be &s;o formed, as con&s;iderably to exalt the grandeur of the State; and men may find in the pride and &s;plendor of that pro&s;perity &s;ome &s;ort of con&s;o|lation for the lo&s;s of their &s;olid privileges. Indeed the increa&s;e of the power of the State has often been urged by artful men, as a pretext for &s;ome abridgement of the public liberty. But the &s;cheme of the junto un|der con&s;ideration, not only &s;trikes a pal&s;y into every nerve of our free con&s;titution, but in the &s;ame degree benumbs and &s;tupifies the whole executive power; rendering Government in all its grand operations lan|guid, uncertain, ineffective; making Mini&s;ters fearful of attempting, and incapable of executing any u&s;eful plan of dome&s;tic arrangement, or of foreign politicks. It tends to produce neither the &s;ecurity of a free Government, nor the energy of a Monarchy that is ab&s;olute. Ac|cordingly the Crown has dwindled away, in proportion to the unnatural and turgid growth of this excre&s;cence on the Court.</P>
<P>The interior Mini&s;try are &s;en&s;ible, that war is a &s;ituation which &s;ets in its full light the value of the hearts of a people; and they well know, that the beginning of the importance of the people mu&s;t be the end of theirs. For this rea&s;on they di&s;cover upon all occa&s;ions the utmo&s;t fear of every thing, which by po&s;&s;ibility may lead to &s;uch an event. I do not mean that they manife&s;t any of that pious fear which is backward to commit the &s;afety of the country to the dubious experi|ment of war. Such a fear, being the tender &s;en&s;ation of virtue, excited, as it is regulated, by rea&s;on, frequently &s;hews it&s;elf in a &s;ea&s;onable boldne&s;s, which keeps danger at a di&s;tance, by &s;eeming to de&s;pi&s;e it. Their fear betrays to the fir&s;t glance of the eye, its true cau&s;e, and its real object. Foreign powers, confident in the knowledge of their character, have not &s;crupled to violate the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties; and, in defiance of them, to make conque&s;ts in the mid&s;t of a general peace, and in the heart of Europe. Such was the conque&s;t of Cor&s;ica, by the profe&s;&s;ed enemies of the freedom of mankind, in defiance of tho&s;e who were formerly its pro|fe&s;&s;ed defenders. We have had ju&s;t claims upon the &s;ame powers; rights which ought to have been &s;acred to them as well as to us, as they had their origin in our lenity and genero&s;ity towards France and Spain in the day of their great humiliation. Such I call the ran&s;om of Mamlia, and the demand on France for the Ea&s;t India pri&s;oners. But the&s;e powers put a
<PB N="28" REF="29">
ju&s;t confidence in their re&s;ource of the <HI>double Cabinet.</HI> The&s;e demands (one of them at lea&s;t) are ha&s;tening fa&s;t towards an acquittal by pre&s;cription. Oblivion begins to &s;pread her cobwebs over all our &s;pirited remon&s;trances. Some of the mo&s;t valuable branches of our trade are al&s;o on the point of peri&s;hing from the &s;ame cau&s;e. I do not mean tho&s;e branches which bear without the hand of the vine-dre&s;&s;er; I mean tho&s;e which the policy of treaties had formerly &s;ecured to us; I mean to mark and di&s;tingui&s;h the trade of Portugal, the lo&s;s of which, and the power of the cabal, have one and the &s;ame aera.</P>
<P>If by any chance the Mini&s;ters, who &s;tand before the curtain, po&s;&s;e&s;s or affect any &s;pirit, it makes little or no impre&s;&s;ion. Foreign Courts and Mini&s;ters, who were among the fir&s;t to di&s;cover and to profit by this in|vention of the <HI>double Cabinet,</HI> attend very little to their remon&s;trances. They know that tho&s;e &s;hadows of Mini&s;ters have nothing to do in the ul|timate di&s;po&s;al of things. Jealou&s;ies and animo&s;ities are &s;edulou&s;ly nou|ri&s;hed in the outward Admini&s;tration, and have been even con&s;idered as a <HI>cau&s;a &s;ine qua non</HI> in its con&s;titution: thence foreign Courts have a cer|tainty, that nothing can be done by common coun&s;el in this nation. If one of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters officially takes up a bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;pirit, it &s;erves only the better to &s;ignalize the meanne&s;s of the re&s;t, and the di&s;cord of them all. His collegues in office are in ha&s;te to &s;hake him off, and to di&s;claim the whole of his proceedings. Of this nature was that a&s;toni&s;h|ing tran&s;action, in which Lord Rochford, our Amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, re|mon&s;trated again&s;t the attempt upon Cor&s;ica, in con&s;equence of a direct authority from Lord Shelburne. This remon&s;trance the French Mini&s;ter treated with the contempt that was natural; as he was a&s;&s;ured, from the Amba&s;&s;ador of his Court to ours, that the&s;e orders of Lord Shelburne were not &s;upported by the re&s;t of the (I had like to have &s;aid Briti&s;h) Ad|mini&s;tration. Lord Rochford, a man of &s;pirit, could not endure this &s;ituation. The con&s;equences were, however, curious. He returns from Paris, and comes home full of anger. Lord Shelburne, who gave the orders, is obliged to give up the &s;eals. Lord Rochford, who obeyed the&s;e orders, re|ceives them. He goes, however, into another department of the &s;ame office, that he might not be obliged officially to acquie&s;ce in one &s;ituation under what he had officially remon&s;trated again&s;t in another. At Paris, the Duke of Choi&s;eul con&s;idered this office arrangement as a compliment to him: here it was &s;poke of as an attention to the delicacy of Lord Roch|ford. But whether the compliment was to one or both, to this nation it was the &s;ame. By this tran&s;action the condition of our Court lay ex|po&s;ed in all its nakedne&s;s. Our office corre&s;pondence has lo&s;t all pre|tence to authenticity; Briti&s;h policy is brought into deri&s;ion in tho&s;e nati|ons, that a while ago trembled at the power of our arms, whil&s;t they
<PB N="29" REF="30">
looked up with confidence to the equity, firmne&s;s, and candour, which &s;hone in all our negotiations. I repre&s;ent this matter exactly in the light in which it has been univer&s;ally received.</P>
<P>Such has been the a&s;pect of our foreign politicks, under the influence of a <HI>double Cabinet</HI> With &s;uch an arrangement at Court, it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould have been otherwi&s;e. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible that this &s;cheme &s;hould have a better effect upon the government of our dependencies, the fir&s;t, the deare&s;t, and mo&s;t delicate objects, of the interior policy of this empire. The Colonies know, that Admini&s;tration is &s;eparated from the Court, divided within it&s;elf, and dete&s;ted by the nation. The <HI>double Cabinet</HI> has, in both the parts of it, &s;hewn the mo&s;t malignant di&s;po|&s;itions towards them, without being able to do them the &s;malle&s;t mi&s;|chief.</P>
<P>They are convinced, by &s;ufficient experience, that no plan, either of lenity or rigour, can be pur&s;ued with uniformity and per&s;everance. There|fore they turn their eyes entirely from Great Britain, where they have neither dependence on friend&s;hip, nor apprehen&s;ion from enmity. They look to them&s;elves, and their own arrangements. They grow every day into alienation from this country; and whil&s;t they are becoming di&s;connected with our Government, we have not the con&s;olation to find, that they are even friendly in their new independence. Nothing can equal the futility, the weakne&s;s, the ra&s;hne&s;s, the timidity, the perpetual contra|diction in the management of our affairs in that part of the world. A volume might be written on this melancholy &s;ubject; but it were better to leave it entirely to the reflexions of the reader him&s;elf than not to treat it in the extent it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>In what manner our dome&s;tic oeconomy is affected by this &s;y&s;tem, it is needle&s;s to explain. It is the perpetual &s;ubject of their own com|plaints.</P>
<P>The Court party re&s;olve the whole into faction. Having &s;aid &s;omething before upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve here, that when they give this account of the prevalence of faction, they pre&s;ent no very favourable a&s;pect of the confidence of the people in their own Government. They may be a&s;&s;ured, that however they amu&s;e them|&s;elves with a variety of projects for &s;ub&s;tituting &s;omething el&s;e in the place of that great and only foundation of Government, the confidence of the people, every attempt will but make their condition wor&s;e. When men imagine that their food is only a cover for poi&s;on, and when they neither love nor tru&s;t the hand that &s;erves it, it is not the name of the roa&s;t beef of Old England, that will per&s;uade them to &s;it down to the table that is &s;pread for them. When the people conceive that laws, and tribunals, and even popular a&s;&s;emblies, are perverted from the ends
<PB N="30" REF="31">
of their in&s;titution, they find in tho&s;e names of degenerated e&s;tabli&s;hments only new motives to di&s;content. Tho&s;e bodies, which, when full of life and beauty, lay in their arms, and were their joy and comfort, when dead and putrid, become but the more loath&s;ome from remembrance of former endearments. A &s;ullen gloom, and furious di&s;order, prevail by fits; the nation lo&s;es its reli&s;h for peace and pro&s;perity, as it did in that &s;ea&s;on of fullne&s;s which opened our troubles in the time of Charles the Fir&s;t. A &s;pecies of men to whom a &s;tate of order would become a &s;entence of ob|&s;curity, are nouri&s;hed into a dangerous magnitude by the heat of inte&s;tine di&s;turbances; and it is no wonder that, by a &s;ort of &s;ini&s;ter piety, they cheri&s;h, in their turn, the di&s;orders which are the parents of all their con&s;equence. Superficial ob&s;ervers con&s;ider &s;uch per&s;ons as the cau&s;e of the public unea&s;ine&s;s, when, in truth, they are nothing more than the effect of it. Good men look upon this di&s;tracted &s;cene with &s;orrow and indignation. Their hands are tied behind them. They are de&s;poiled of all the power which might enable them to reconcile the &s;trength of Government with the rights of the people. They &s;tand in a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing alternative. But in the election among evils they hope bet|ter things from temporary confu&s;ion, than from e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ervitude. In the mean time, the voice of law is not to be heard. Fierce licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s begets violent re&s;traints. The military arm is the &s;ole reliance; and then, call your con&s;titution what you plea&s;e, it is the &s;word that governs. The civil power, like every other that calls in the aid of an ally &s;tronger than it&s;elf, peri&s;hes by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance it receives. But the contrivers of this &s;cheme of Government will not tru&s;t &s;olely to the military power; becau&s;e they are cunning men. Their re&s;tle&s;s and crooked &s;pirit drives them to rake in the dirt of every kind of ex|pedient. Unable to rule the multitude, they endeavour to rai&s;e di|vi&s;ions among&s;t them. One mob is hired to de&s;troy another; a pro|cedure which at once encourages the boldne&s;s of the populace, and ju&s;tly increa&s;es their di&s;content. Men become pen&s;ioners of &s;tate on account of their abilities in the array of riot, and the di&s;cipline of con|fu&s;ion. Government is put under the di&s;graceful nece&s;&s;ity of pro|tecting from the &s;everity of the laws that very licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which the laws had been before violated to repre&s;s. Every thing partakes of the original di&s;order. Anarchy predominates without freedom, and &s;ervi|tude without &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion or &s;ubordination. The&s;e are the con&s;equences inevitable to our public peace, from the &s;cheme of rendering the ex|ecutory Government at once odious and feeble; of freeing Admini&s;tra|tion from the con&s;titutional and &s;alutary control of Parliament, and inventing for it a <HI>new control,</HI> unknown to the con&s;titution, an <HI>interior Cabinet;</HI> which brings the whole body of Government into confu&s;ion and contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32">
After having &s;tated, as &s;hortly as I am able, the effects of this &s;y&s;tem on our foreign affairs, on the policy of our Government with regard to our dependencies, and on the interior oeconomy of the Commonwealth; there remains only, in this part of my de&s;ign, to &s;ay &s;omething of the grand principle which fir&s;t recommended this &s;y&s;tem at Court. The pretence was, to prevent the King from being en&s;laved by a faction, and made a pri&s;oner in his clo&s;et. This &s;cheme might have been expected to an&s;wer at lea&s;t its own end, and to indemnify the King, in his per&s;onal capacity, for all the confu&s;ion into which it has thrown his Government. But has it in reality an&s;wered this purpo&s;e? I am &s;ure, if it had, every affectionate &s;ubject would have one motive for enduring with patience all the evils which attend it.</P>
<P>In order to come at the truth in this matter, it may not be ami&s;s to con&s;ider it &s;omewhat in detail. I &s;peak here of the King, and not of the Crown; the intere&s;ts of which we have already touched. Independent of that greatne&s;s which a King po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es merely by being a repre&s;entative of the national dignity, the things in which he may have an individual intere&s;t &s;eem to be the&s;e: wealth accumulated; wealth &s;pent in magni|ficence, plea&s;ure, or beneficence; per&s;onal re&s;pect and attention; and above all, private ea&s;e and repo&s;e of mind. The&s;e compo&s;e the inventory of pro&s;perous circum&s;tances, whether they regard a Prince or a &s;ubject; their enjoyments differing only in the &s;cale upon which they are formed.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then we were to a&s;k, whether the King has been richer than his predece&s;&s;ors in accumulated wealth, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the plan of Favouriti&s;m? I believe it will be found that the picture of royal in|digence which our Court has pre&s;ented until this year, has been truly humiliating. Nor has it been relieved from this un&s;eemly di&s;tre&s;s, but by means which have hazarded the affection of the people, and &s;haken their confidence in Parliament. If the public trea&s;ures had been exhau&s;ted in magnificence and &s;plendour, this di&s;tre&s;s would have been accounted for, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure ju&s;tified. Nothing would be more unworthy of this nation, than with a mean and mechanical rule, to mete out the &s;plendour of the Crown. Indeed I have found very few per&s;ons di&s;po&s;ed to &s;o ungenerous a procedure. But the generality of people, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, do feel a good deal mortified, when they compare the wants of the Court with its expences. They do not behold the cau&s;e of this di&s;tre&s;s in any part of the apparatus of royal magnificence. In all this, they &s;ee nothing but the operations of par&s;imony, attended with all the con&s;equences of profu&s;ion. Nothing expended, nothing &s;aved. Their wonder is increa&s;ed by their knowledge, that be&s;ides the revenue &s;ettled on his Maje&s;ty's Civil Li&s;t to the amount of 800,000<HI>l.</HI> a year, he has a farther aid, from a large pen&s;ion li&s;t, near 90,000<HI>l.</HI> a year, in Ireland; from
<PB N="32" REF="33">
the produce of the Dutchy of Lanca&s;ter (which we are told has been greatly improved); from the revenue of the Dutchy of Cornwall; from the American quit-rents; from the four and a half per cent duty in the Leeward I&s;lands; this la&s;t worth to be &s;ure con&s;iderably more than 40,000<HI>l.</HI> a year. The whole is certainly not much &s;hort of a million annually.</P>
<P>The&s;e are revenues within the knowledge and cognizance of our national Councils. We have no direct right to examine into the receipts from his Maje&s;ty's German Dominions, and the Bi&s;hoprick of O&s;nabrug. This is unque&s;tionably true. But that which is not within the province of Parliament, is yet within the &s;phere of every man's own reflexion. If a foreign Prince re&s;ided among&s;t us, the &s;tate of his revenues could not fail of becoming the &s;ubject of our &s;peculation. Filled with an anxious concern for whatever regards the welfare of our Sovereign, it is im|po&s;&s;ible, in con&s;idering the mi&s;erable circum&s;tances into which he has been brought, that this obvious topick &s;hould be entirely pa&s;&s;ed over. There is an opinion univer&s;al, that the&s;e revenues produce &s;omething not incon&s;iderable, clear of all charges and e&s;tabli&s;hments. This produce the people do not believe to be hoarded, nor perceive to be &s;pent. It is ac|counted for in the only manner it can, by &s;uppo&s;ing that it is drawn away, for the &s;upport of that Court faction, which, whil&s;t it di&s;tre&s;&s;es the nation, impoveri&s;hes the Prince in every one of his re&s;ources. I once more caution the reader, that I do not urge this con&s;ideration concerning the foreign revenue, as if I &s;uppo&s;ed we had a direct right to examine into the expenditure of any part of it; but &s;olely for the purpo&s;e of &s;hew|ing how little this &s;y&s;tem of Favouriti&s;m has been advantageous to the Monarch him&s;elf; which, without magnificence, has &s;unk him into a &s;tate of unnatural poverty; at the &s;ame time that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every means of affluence, from ample revenues, both in this country, and in other parts of his dominions.</P>
<P>Has this &s;y&s;tem provided better for the treatment becoming his high and &s;acred character, and &s;ecured the King from tho&s;e di&s;gu&s;ts attached to the nece&s;&s;ity of employing men who are not per&s;onally agree|able? This is a topick upon which for many rea&s;ons I could wi&s;h to be &s;ilent; but the pretence of &s;ecuring again&s;t &s;uch cau&s;es of unea&s;ine&s;s, is the corner-&s;tone of the Court party. It has however &s;o happened, that if I were to fix upon any one point, in which this &s;y&s;tem has been more particularly and &s;hamefully blameable, the effects which it has produced would ju&s;tify me in choo&s;ing for that point its tendency to degrade the per&s;onal dignity of the Sovereign, and to expo&s;e him to a thou&s;and contra|dictions and mortifications. It is but too evident in what manner the&s;e projectors of royal greatne&s;s have fulfilled all their magnificent promi&s;es. Without recapitulating all the circum&s;tances of the reign, every one of
<PB N="33" REF="34">
which is more or le&s;s a melancholy proof of the truth of what I have ad|vanced, let us con&s;ider the language of the Court but a few years ago, con|cerning mo&s;t of the per&s;ons now in the external Admini&s;tration: let me a&s;k, whether any enemy to the per&s;onal feelings of the Sovereign, could po&s;&s;ibly contrive a keener in&s;trument of per&s;onal mortification, and degra|dation of all dignity, than almo&s;t every part and member of the pre&s;ent arrangement? nor, in the whole cour&s;e of our hi&s;tory, has any compliance with the will of the people ever been known to extort from any Prince a greater contradiction to all his own declared affections and di&s;likes than that which is now adopted, in direct oppo&s;ition to every thing the people approve and de&s;ire.</P>
<P>An opinion prevails that greatne&s;s has been more than once advi&s;ed to &s;ubmit to certain conde&s;cen&s;ions towards individuals, which have been denied to the entreaties of a nation. For the meane&s;t and mo&s;t dependent in&s;trument of this &s;y&s;tem knows, that there are hours when its exi&s;tence may depend upon his adherence to it; and he takes his advantage accord|ingly. Indeed it is a law of nature, that whoever is nece&s;&s;ary to what we have made our object, is &s;ure in &s;ome way, or in &s;ome time or other, to become our ma&s;ter. All this however is &s;ubmitted to, in order to avoid that mon&s;trous evil of governing in concurrence with the opinion of the people. For it &s;eems to be laid down as a maxim, that a King has &s;ome &s;ort of intere&s;t in giving unea&s;ine&s;s to his &s;ubjects: that all who are plea&s;ing to them, are to be of cour&s;e di&s;agreeable to him: that as &s;oon as the per&s;ons who are odious at Court, are known to be odious to the people, it is &s;natched at as a lucky occa&s;ion of &s;howering down upon them all kinds of emoluments and honours. None are con&s;idered as well|wi&s;hers to the Crown, but tho&s;e who advi&s;e to &s;ome unpopular cour&s;e of action; none capable of &s;erving it, but tho&s;e who are obliged to call at every in&s;tant upon all its power for the &s;afety of their lives. None are &s;uppo&s;ed to be fit prie&s;ts in the temple of Government, but the per&s;ons who are compelled to fly into it for &s;anctuary. Such is the effect of this refined project; &s;uch is ever the re&s;ult of all the contrivances which are u&s;ed to free men from the &s;ervitude of their rea&s;on, and from the nece&s;&s;ity of ordering their affairs according to their evident intere&s;ts. The&s;e contrivances oblige them to run into a real and ruinous &s;ervitude, in order to avoid a &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;traint that might be attended with ad|vantage.</P>
<P>If therefore this &s;y&s;tem has &s;o ill an&s;wered its own grand pretence of &s;a|ving the King from the nece&s;&s;ity of employing per&s;ons di&s;agreeable to him, has it given more peace and tranquillity to his Maje&s;ty's private hours? No, mo&s;t certainly. The father of his people cannot po&s;&s;ibly enjoy repo&s;e, while his family is in &s;uch a &s;tate of di&s;traction. Then what has the Crown
<PB N="34" REF="35">
or the King profited by all this fine-wrought &s;cheme? Is he more rich, or more &s;plendid, or more powerful, or more at his ea&s;e, by &s;o many labours and contrivances? Have they not beggared his exchequer, tarni&s;hed the &s;plendor of his Court, &s;unk his dignity, galled his feelings, di&s;compo&s;ed the whole order and happine&s;s of his private life?</P>
<P>It will be very hard, I believe, to &s;tate in what re&s;pect the King has pro|fited by that faction which pre&s;umptuou&s;ly choo&s;e to call them&s;elves <HI>his friends.</HI></P>
<P>If particular men had grown into an attachment, by the di&s;tingui&s;hed honour of the &s;ociety of their Sovereign; and, by being the partakers of his amu&s;ements, came &s;ometimes to prefer the gratification of his per|&s;onal inclinations to the &s;upport of his high character, the thing would be very natural; and it would be excu&s;able enough. But the plea&s;ant part of the &s;tory is, that the&s;e <HI>King's friends</HI> have no more ground for u&s;urping &s;uch a title, than a re&s;ident freeholder in Cumberland or in Cornwall. They are only known to their Sovereign by ki&s;&s;ing his hand, for the offices, pen&s;ions, and grants, into which they have deceived his benignity. May no &s;trom ever come, which will put the firmne&s;s of their attachment to the proof; and which, in the mid&s;t of confu&s;ions, and terrors, and &s;ufferings, may demon&s;trate the eternal difference between a true and &s;evere friend to the Monarchy, and a &s;lippery &s;ycophant of the Court! <HI>Quantum infido &s;curroe di&s;tabit amicus.</HI></P>
<P>So far I have con&s;idered the effect of the Court &s;y&s;tem, chiefly as it ope|rates upon the executive Government, on the temper of the people, and on the happine&s;s of the Sovereign. It remains, that we &s;hould con&s;ider, with a little attention, its operation upon Parliament.</P>
<P>Parliament was indeed the great object of all the&s;e politicks, the end at which they aimed, as well as the in&s;trument by which they were to operate. But, before Parliament could be made &s;ub&s;ervient to a &s;y&s;tem, by which it was to be degraded from the dignity of a national council, into a mere member of the Court, it mu&s;t be greatly changed from its original character.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of this body, I have my eye chiefly on the Hou&s;e of Com|mons. I hope I &s;hall be indulged in a few ob&s;ervations on the nature and character of that a&s;&s;embly; not with regard to its <HI>legal form and power,</HI> but to its <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> and to the purpo&s;es it is meant to an&s;wer in the con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons was &s;uppo&s;ed originally to be <HI>no part of the &s;tanding Government of this country.</HI> It was con&s;idered as a <HI>control,</HI> i&s;&s;uing <HI>immediately</HI> from the people, and &s;peedily to be re&s;olved into the ma&s;s from whence it aro&s;e. In this re&s;pect it was in the higher part of Govern|ment what juries are in the lower. The capacity of a magi&s;trate being
<PB N="35" REF="36">
tran&s;itory, and that of a citizen permanent, the latter capacity it was hoped would of cour&s;e preponderate in all di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, not only between the people and the &s;tanding authority of the Crown, but between the people and the fleeting authority of the Hou&s;e of Commons it&s;elf. It was hoped that, being of a middle nature between &s;ubject and Government, they would feel with a more tender and a nearer intere&s;t every thing that concerned the people, than the other remoter and more permanent parts of Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Whatever alterations time and the nece&s;&s;ary accommodation of bu&s;ine&s;s may have introduced, this character can never be &s;u&s;tained, unle&s;s the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;hall be made to bear &s;ome &s;tamp of the actual di&s;po&s;ition of the people at large. It would (among public misfortunes) be an evil more natural and tolerable, that the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;hould be in|fected with every epidemical phren&s;y of the people, as this would indicate &s;ome con&s;anguinity, &s;ome &s;ympathy of nature with their con&s;tituents, than that they &s;hould in all ca&s;es be wholly untouched by the opinions and feelings of the people out of doors. By this want of &s;ympathy they would cea&s;e to be an Hou&s;e of Commons. For it is not the derivation of the power of that Hou&s;e from the people, which makes it in a di&s;tinct &s;en&s;e their repre&s;entative. The King is the repre&s;entative of the people; &s;o are the Lords; &s;o are the Judges. They all are tru&s;tees for the people, as well as the Commons; becau&s;e no power is given for the &s;ole &s;ake of the holder; and although Government certainly is an in&s;titution of Divine authority, yet its forms, and the per&s;ons who admini&s;ter it, all originate from the people.</P>
<P>A popular origin cannot therefore be the characteri&s;tical di&s;tinction of a popular repre&s;entative. This belongs equally to all parts of Government, and in all forms. The virtue, &s;pirit, and e&s;&s;ence of a Hou&s;e of Commons con&s;i&s;ts in its being the expre&s;s image of the feelings of the nation. It was not in&s;tituted to be a controul <HI>upon</HI> the people, as of late it has been taught, by a doctrine of the mo&s;t pernicious tendency. It was de&s;igned as a controul <HI>for</HI> the people. Other in&s;titutions have been formed for the purpo&s;e of checking popular exce&s;&s;es; and they are, I apprehend, fully adequate to their object. If not, they ought to be made &s;o. The Hou&s;e of Commons, as it was never intended for the &s;upport of peace and &s;ubor|dination, is mi&s;erably appointed for that &s;ervice; having no &s;tronger weapon than its Mace, and no better officer than its Serjeant at Arms, which it can command of its own proper authority. A vigilant and jealous eye over executory and judicial magi&s;tracy; an anxious care of public money, an openne&s;s, approaching towards facility, to public complaint: the&s;e &s;eem to be the true characteri&s;tics of an Hou&s;e of Commons. But an addre&s;&s;ing Hou&s;e of Commons, and a petitioning nation; an Hou&s;e of Commons full of con&s;idence, when the nation is plunged in de&s;pair; in the utmo&s;t harmony with Mini&s;ters, whom the people regard with the utmo&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="37">
abhorrence; who vote thanks, when the public opinion calls upon them for impeachments; who are eager to grant, when the general voice demands account; who, in all di&s;putes between the people and Admini&s;tration, pre&s;ume again&s;t the people; who puni&s;h their di&s;orders, but refu&s;e even to enquire into the provocations to them; this is an unnatural, a mon&s;trous &s;tate of things in this con&s;titution. Such an A&s;&s;embly may be a great, wi&s;e, awful Senate; but it is not to any popular purpo&s;e an Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>This change from an immediate &s;tate of procuration and delegation to a cour&s;e of acting as from original power, is the way in which all the popular magi&s;tracies in the world have been perverted from their purpo&s;es. It is indeed their greate&s;t and &s;ometimes their incurable cor|ruption. For there is a material di&s;tinction between that corruption by which particular points are carried again&s;t rea&s;on, (this is a thing which cannot be prevented by human wi&s;dom, and is of le&s;s con&s;equence) and the corruption of the principle it&s;elf. For then the evil is not accidental, but &s;ettled. The di&s;temper becomes the natural habit.</P>
<P>For my part, I &s;hall be compelled to conclude the principle of Parliament to be totally corrupted, and therefore its ends entirely defeated, when I &s;ee two &s;ymptoms: fir&s;t, a rule of indi&s;criminate &s;upport to all Mini&s;ters; be|cau&s;e this de&s;troys their very end as a controul, and is a general previous &s;anction to mi&s;government: and &s;econdly, the &s;etting up any claims ad|ver&s;e to the right of free election; for this tends to &s;ubvert the legal au|thority by which they &s;it.</P>
<P>I know that, &s;ince the Revolution, along with many dangerous, many u&s;eful powers of Government have been weakened. It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to have frequent recour&s;e to the Legi&s;lature. Parliaments mu&s;t therefore &s;it every year, and for great part of the year. The dread&s;ul di&s;orders of frequent elections have al&s;o nece&s;&s;itated a &s;eptennial in&s;tead of a triennial duration. The&s;e circum&s;tances, I mean the con&s;tant habit of authority, and the unfrequency of elections, have tended very much to draw the Hou&s;e of Commons towards the character of a &s;tanding Senate. It is a di&s;order which has ari&s;en from the cure of greater di&s;orders; it has ari&s;en from the extreme difficulty of reconciling liberty under a monarchical Government, with external &s;trength and with internal tranquillity.</P>
<P>It is very clear that we cannot free our&s;elves entirely from this great inconvenience; but I would not encrea&s;e an evil, becau&s;e I was not able to remove it; and becau&s;e it was not in my power to keep the Hou&s;e of Commons religiou&s;ly true to its fir&s;t principles, I would not argue for carrying it to a total oblivion of them. This has been the great &s;cheme of power in our time. They who will not conform their conduct to the public good, and cannot &s;upport it by the prerogative of the Crown,
<PB N="37" REF="38">
have adopted a new plan. They have totally abandoned the &s;hattered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd old-fa&s;hioned fortre&s;s of prerogative, and made a lodgement in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">trong hold of Parliament it&s;elf. If they have any evil de&s;ign to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">here is no ordinary legal power commen&s;urate, they bring it into Par|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">iament. In Parliament the whole is executed from the beginning to the end. In Parliament the power of obtaining their object is ab&s;olute; and the &s;afety in the proceeding perfect; no rules to con&s;ine, no after|reckonings to terrify. Parliament cannot with any great propriety puni&s;h others, for things in which they them&s;elves have been accomplices. Thus the controul of Parliament upon the executory power is lo&s;t; becau&s;e Par|liament is made to partake in every con&s;iderable act of Government. <HI>Impeachment, that great guardian of the purity of the Con&s;titution, is in danger of being lo&s;t, even to the idea of it.</HI></P>
<P>By this plan &s;everal important ends are an&s;wered to the Cabal. If the authority of Parliament &s;upports it&s;elf, the credit of every act of Government which they contrive, is &s;aved; but if the act be &s;o very odious that the whole &s;trength of Parliament is in&s;ufficient to recommend it, then Parliament is it&s;elf di&s;credited; and this di&s;credit increa&s;es more and more that indifference to the con&s;titution, which it is the con&s;tant aim of its enemies, by their abu&s;e of Parliamentary powers, to render general among the people. Whenever Parliament is per&s;uaded to a&s;&s;ume the offices of executive Government, it will lo&s;e all the confidence, love, and veneration, which it has ever enjoyed whil&s;t it was &s;uppo&s;ed the <HI>corrective and controul</HI> of the acting powers of the &s;tate. This would be the event, though its conduct in &s;uch a perver&s;ion of its functions &s;hould be tolerably ju&s;t and moderate; but if it &s;hould be iniquitous, violent, full of pa&s;&s;ion, and full of faction, it would be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t intolerable of all the modes of tyranny.</P>
<P>For a con&s;iderable time this &s;eparation of the repre&s;entatives from their con&s;tituents went on with a &s;ilent progre&s;s; and had tho&s;e, who conducted the plan for their total &s;eparation, been per&s;ons of temper and abilities any way equal to the magnitude of their de&s;ign, the &s;ucce&s;s would have been infallible: but by their precipitancy they have laid it open in all its naked|ne&s;s; the nation is alarmed at it; and the event may not be plea&s;ant to the contrivers of the &s;cheme. In the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, the corps called the <HI>King's friends</HI> made an hardy attempt all at once, <HI>to alter the right of election it&s;elf;</HI> to put it into the power of the Hou&s;e of Commons to di&s;able any per&s;on di&s;agreeable to them from &s;itting in Parliament, without any other rule than their own plea&s;ure; to make incapacities, either general &s;or de&s;criptions of men, or particular for individuals; and to take into their body, per&s;ons who avowedly had never been cho&s;en by the majority of legal electors, nor agreeably to any known rule of law.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39">
The arguments upon which this claim was founded and combated, are not my bu&s;ine&s;s here. Never has a &s;ubject been more amply and more learnedly handled; nor upon one &s;ide in my opinion more &s;atisfactorily; they who are not convinced by what is already written would not receive conviction <HI>though one aro&s;e from the dead.</HI></P>
<P>I too have thought on this &s;ubject: but my purpo&s;e here, is only to con&s;ider it as a part of the favourite project of Government; to ob&s;erve on the motives which led to it; and to trace its political con&s;equences.</P>
<P>A violent rage for the puni&s;hment of Mr. Wilkes was the pretence of the whole. This gentleman, by &s;etting him&s;elf &s;trongly in oppo&s;ition to the Court cabal, had become at once an object of their per&s;ecution, and of the popular favour. The hatred of the Court party pur&s;uing, and the countenance of the people protecting him, it very &s;oon became not at all a que&s;tion on the man, but a trial of &s;trength between the two parties. The advantage of the victory in this particular conte&s;t was the pre&s;ent, but not the only, nor by any means, the principal object. Its operation upon the character of the Hou&s;e of Commons was the great point in view. The point to be gained by the cabal was this; that a precedent &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed tending to &s;hew, <HI>That the favour of the People was not &s;o &s;ure a road as the favour of the Court even to popular honours and popular tru&s;ts.</HI> A &s;trenuous re&s;i&s;tance to every appearance of lawle&s;s power; a &s;pirit of inde|pendence carried to &s;ome degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m; an inqui&s;itive character to di&s;cover, and a bold one to di&s;play, every corruption and every error of Government; the&s;e are the qualities which recommend a man to a &s;eat in the Hou&s;e of Commons, in open and merely popular elections. An indolent and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition; a di&s;po&s;ition to think charitably of all the actions of men in power, and to live in a mutual intercour&s;e of favours with them; an inclination rather to countenance a &s;trong u&s;e of authority, than to bear any &s;ort of licentiou&s;ne&s;s on the part of the people; the&s;e are unfavourable qualities in an open election for Members of Parliament.</P>
<P>The in&s;tinct which carries the people towards the choice of the former, is ju&s;tified by rea&s;on; becau&s;e a man of &s;uch a character, even in its ex|orbitancies, does not directly contradict the purpo&s;es of a tru&s;t, the end of which is a controul on power. The latter character, even when it is not in its extreme, will execute this tru&s;t but very imperfectly; and if deviating to the lea&s;t exce&s;s, will certainly fru&s;trate in&s;tead of forwarding the purpo&s;es of a controul on Government. But when the Hou&s;e of Commons was to be new modelled, this principle was not only to be changed, but rever&s;ed. Whil&s;t any errours committed in &s;upport of power, were left to the law, with every advantage of favourable con&s;truction, of mitigation, and finally of pardon; all exce&s;&s;es on the &s;ide of liberty, or in pur&s;uit of popular favour, or in defence of popular rights and privileges, were not only to be
<PB N="39" REF="40">
puni&s;hed by the rigour of the known law, but by a <HI>di&s;cretionary</HI> proceed|ing which brought on <HI>the lo&s;s of the popular object it&s;elf.</HI> Popularity was to be rendered, if not directly penal, at lea&s;t highly dangerous. The favour of the people might lead even to a di&s;qualification of repre&s;enting them. Their odium might become, &s;trained through the medium of two or three con&s;tructions, the means of &s;itting as the tru&s;tee of all that was dear to them. This is puni&s;hing the offence in the offending part. Until this time, the opinion of the people, through the power of an A&s;&s;embly, &s;till in &s;ome &s;ort popular, led to the greate&s;t honours and emoluments in the gift of the Crown. Now the principle is rever&s;ed; and the favour of the Court is the only &s;ure way of obtaining and holding tho&s;e honours which ought to be in the di&s;po&s;al of the people.</P>
<P>It &s;ignifies very little how this matter may be quibbled away. Example, the only argument of effect in civil life, demon&s;trates the truth of my pro|po&s;ition. Nothing can alter my opinion concerning the pernicious ten|dency of this example, until I &s;ee &s;ome man for his indi&s;cretion in the &s;upport of power, for his violent and intemperate &s;ervility, rendered incapable of &s;itting in Parliament. For as it now &s;tands, the fault of over&s;training popu|lar qualities, and, irregularly if you plea&s;e, a&s;&s;erting popular privileges, has led to di&s;qualification; the oppo&s;ite fault never has produced the &s;lighte&s;t puni&s;hment. Re&s;i&s;tance to power, has &s;hut the door of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons to one man; ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s and &s;ervility, to none.</P>
<P>Not that I would encourage popular di&s;order, or any di&s;order. But I would leave &s;uch offences to the law, to be puni&s;hed in mea&s;ure and pro|portion. The laws of this country are for the mo&s;t part con&s;tituted, and wi&s;ely &s;o, for the general ends of Government, rather than for the pre&s;ervation of our particular liberties. Whatever therefore is done in &s;up|port of liberty, by per&s;ons not in publick tru&s;t, or not acting merely in that tru&s;t, is liable to be more or le&s;s out of the ordinary cour&s;e of the law; and the law it&s;elf is &s;ufficient to animadvert upon it with great &s;everity. Nothing indeed can hinder that &s;evere letter from cru&s;hing us, except the temperaments it may receive from a trial by jury. But if the habit prevails of <HI>going beyond the law,</HI> and &s;uper&s;eding this judicature, of carrying offences, real or &s;uppo&s;ed, into the legi&s;lative bodies, who &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves into <HI>courts of criminal equity</HI> (&s;o the <HI>Star Chamber</HI> has been called by Lord Bacon), all the evils of the <HI>Star Chamber</HI> are revived. A large and liberal con&s;truction in a&s;certaining offences, and a di&s;cretionary power in puni&s;hing them, is the idea of <HI>criminal equity;</HI> which is in truth a mon&s;ter in Juri&s;prudence. It &s;ignifies nothing whether a court for this purpo&s;e be a Committee of Council, or an Hou&s;e of Com|mons, or an Hou&s;e of Lords; the liberty of the &s;ubject will be equally &s;ubverted by it. The true end and purpo&s;e of that Hou&s;e of Parliament which entertains &s;uch a juri&s;diction will be de&s;troyed by it.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41">
I will not believe, what no other man living believes, that Mr. Wilkes was puni&s;hed for the indecency of his publications, or the impiety of his ran&s;acked clo&s;et. If he had fallen in a common &s;laughter of libellers and bla&s;phemers, I could well believe, that nothing more was meant than wa|pretended. But when I &s;ee that, for years together, full as impious, and perhaps more dangerous writings to religion and virtue and order, have not been puni&s;hed, nor their authors di&s;countenanced; that the mo&s;t audacious libels on Royal Maje&s;ty have pa&s;&s;ed without notice; that the mo&s;t trea&s;onable invectives again&s;t the laws, liberties, and con&s;titution of the country, have not met with the &s;lighte&s;t animadver&s;ion; I mu&s;t con|&s;ider this as a &s;hocking and &s;hamele&s;s pretence. Never did an envenomed &s;ecurrility again&s;t every thing &s;acred and civil, public and private, rage through the kingdom with &s;uch a furious and unbridled licence. All this while the peace of the nation mu&s;t be &s;haken, to ruin one libeller, and to tear from the populace a &s;ingle favourite.</P>
<P>Nor is it that vice merely &s;kulks in an ob&s;cure and contemptible impu|nity. Does not the publick behold with indignation, per&s;ons not only generally &s;candalous in their lives, but the identical per&s;ons who by their &s;ociety, their in&s;truction, their example, their encouragement, have drawn t is man into the very faults which have furni&s;hed the Cabal with a pretence for his per&s;ecution, loaded with every kind of favour, honour and di&s;tinction which a Court can be&s;tow? Add but the crime of &s;ervility (the <HI>foedum crimen &s;ervitutis</HI>) to every other crime, and the whole ma&s;s is immediately tran&s;muted into virtue, and becomes the ju&s;t &s;ubject of reward and honour. When therefore I reflect upon this method pur&s;ued by the cabal in di&s;tributing rewards and puni&s;hments, I mu&s;t conclude that Mr. Wilkes is the object of per&s;ecution, not on account of what he has done in common with others who are the objects of reward, but for that in which he differs from many of them: that he is pur&s;ued for the &s;pirited di&s;po&s;itions which are blended with his vices; for his un|conquerable firmne&s;s, for his re&s;olute, indefatigable, &s;trenuous re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, therefore, it was not the man that was to be puni&s;hed, nor his faults that were to be di&s;countenanced. Oppo&s;ition to acts of power was to be marked by a kind of civil pro&s;cription. The popularity which &s;hould ari&s;e from &s;uch an oppo&s;ition was to be &s;hewn unable to protect it. The qualities by which court is made to the people, were to render every fault inexpiable, and every error irretrievable. The qualities by which court is made to power, were to cover and to &s;anctify every thing. He that will have a &s;ure and honourable &s;eat in the Hou&s;e of Commons, mu&s;t take care how he adventures to cultivate popular qualities; otherwi&s;e he may re|member the old maxim, <HI>Breves et infau&s;tos populi Romani amores.</HI> If,
<PB N="41" REF="42">
therefore, a pur&s;uit of popularity expo&s;e a man to greater dangers than a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ervility, the principle which is the life and &s;oul of popular elections, will peri&s;h out of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It behoves the people of England to con&s;ider how the Hou&s;e of Com|mons under the operation of the&s;e examples mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be con&s;ti|tuted. On the &s;ide of the Court will be, all honours, offices, emolu|ments; every &s;ort of per&s;onal gratification to avarice or vanity; and, what is of more moment to mo&s;t gentlemen, the means of growing, by innu|merable petty &s;ervices to individuals, into a &s;preading intere&s;t in their country. On the other hand, let us &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on unconnected with the Court, and in oppo&s;ition to its &s;y&s;tem. For his own per&s;on, no office, or emolu|ment, or title; no promotion, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, or civil, or military, or naval, for children, or brothers, or kindred. In vain an expiring intere&s;t in a borough calls for offices, or &s;mall livings, for the children of mayors, and aldermen, and capital burge&s;&s;es. His Court rival has them all. He can do an infinite number of acts of genero&s;ity and kindne&s;s, and even of public &s;pirit. He can procure indemnity from quarters. He can procure advantages in trade. He can get pardons for offences. He can obtain a thou&s;and favours, and avert a thou&s;and evils. He may, while he betrays every valuable intere&s;t of the kingdom, be a benefactor, a patron, a father, a guardian angel, to his borough. The unfortunate independent member has nothing to offer but har&s;h refu&s;al, or pitiful excu&s;e, or de&s;pondent repre&s;entation of an hopele&s;s intere&s;t. Except from his private fortune, in which he may be equalled, perhaps exceeded, by his Court competitor, he has no way of &s;hewing any one good quality, or of making a &s;ingle friend. In the Hou&s;e, he votes for ever in a di&s;pirited minority. If he &s;peaks, the doors are locked. A body of loquacious place-men go out to tell the world, that all he aims at, is to get into office. If he has not the talent of elocution, which is the ca&s;e of many as wi&s;e and knowing men as any in the Hou&s;e, he is liable to all the&s;e inconveniencies, without the eclat which attends upon any tolerably &s;ucce&s;sful exertion of eloquence. Can we conceive a more di&s;|couraging po&s;t of duty than this? Strip it of the poor reward of popularity; &s;uffer even the exce&s;&s;es committed in defence of the popular intere&s;t, to become a ground for the majority of that Hou&s;e to form a di&s;qualification out of the line of the law, and at their plea&s;ure, attended not only with the lo&s;s of the franchi&s;e, but with every kind of per&s;onal di&s;grace.&mdash;If this &s;hall happen, the people of this kingdom may be a&s;&s;ured, that they cannot be firmly or faithfully &s;erved by any man. It is out of the nature of men and things that they &s;hould; and their pre&s;umption will be equal to their folly, if they expect it. The power of the people, within the laws, mu&s;t &s;hew it&s;elf &s;ufficient to protect every repre&s;entative in the animated per|formance of his duty, or that duty cannot be performed. The Hou&s;e
<PB N="42" REF="43">
of Commons can never be a controul on other parts of Governmen unle&s;s they are controlledthem&s;elves by their con&s;tituents; and unle&s;s the&s;e con&s;tituents po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome right in the choice of that Hou&s;e, which it is not in the power of that Hou&s;e to take away. If they &s;uffer this power of ar|bitrary incapacitation to &s;tand, they have utterly perverted every other power of the Hou&s;e of Commons. The late proceeding, I will not &s;ay, <HI>is</HI> contrary to law; it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;o; for the power which is claimed cannot, by any po&s;&s;i|bility, be a legal power in any limited member of Government.</P>
<P>The power which they claim, of declaring incapacities, would not be above the ju&s;t claims of a final judicature, if they had not laid it down as a leading principle, that they had no rule in the exerci&s;e of this claim, but their own <HI>di&s;cretion.</HI> Not one of their abettors has ever undertaken to a&s;&s;ign the prin|ciple of unfitne&s;s, the &s;pecies or degree of delinquency, on which the Hou&s;e of Commons will expel, nor the mode of proceeding upon it, nor the evidence upon which it is e&s;tabli&s;hed. The direct con&s;equence of which is, that the fir&s;t franchi&s;e of an Engli&s;hman, and that on which all the re&s;t vitally depend, is to be forfeited for &s;ome offence which no man knows, and which is to be proved by no known rule what&s;oever of legal evidence. This is &s;o anomalous to our whole con&s;titution, that I will venture to &s;ay, the mo&s;t trivial right which the &s;ubject claims, never was, nor can be, forfeited in &s;uch a manner.</P>
<P>The whole of their u&s;urpation is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon this method of arguing. We do not <HI>make</HI> laws. No; we do not contend for this power. We only <HI>declare</HI> law; and, as we are a tribunal both competent and &s;upreme, what we declare to be law becomes law, although it &s;hould not have been &s;o before. Thus the circum&s;tance of having no <HI>appeal</HI> from their juri&s;diction is made to imply that they have no <HI>rule</HI> in the ex|erci&s;e of it; the judgement does not derive its validity from its conformity to the law; but prepo&s;terou&s;ly the law is made to attend on the judgement; and the rule of the judgement is no other than the <HI>occa&s;ional will of the Hou&s;e.</HI> An arbitrary di&s;cretion leads, legality follows; which is ju&s;t the very nature and de&s;cription of a legi&s;lative act.</P>
<P>This claim in their hands was no barren theory. It was pur&s;ued into its utmo&s;t con&s;equences; and a dangerous principle has begot a corre&s;pon|dent practice. A &s;y&s;tematic &s;pirit has been &s;hewn upon both &s;ides. The electors of Middle&s;ex cho&s;e a per&s;on whom the Hou&s;e of Commons had voted incapable; and the Hou&s;e of Commons has taken in a member whom the electors of Middle&s;ex had not cho&s;en. By a con&s;truction on that le|gi&s;lative power which had been a&s;&s;umed, they declared that the true legal &s;en&s;e of the county was contained in the minority, on that occa&s;ion; and might, on a re&s;i&s;tance to a vote of incapacity, be contained in any minority.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="44">
When any con&s;truction of law goes again&s;t the &s;pirit of the privilege it was meant to &s;upport, it is a vicious con&s;truction. It is material to us to be repre&s;ented really and <HI>bona fide,</HI> and not in forms, in types, and &s;hadows, and fictions of law. The right of election was not e&s;tabli&s;hed merely as a <HI>matter of form,</HI> to &s;atisfy &s;ome method and rule of technical rea&s;oning; it was not a principle which might &s;ub&s;titute a <HI>Titius</HI> or a <HI>Maevius,</HI> a <HI>John Doe</HI> or <HI>Richard Roe,</HI> in the place of a man &s;pecially cho&s;en; not a principle which was ju&s;t as well &s;atisfied with one man as with another. It is a right, the effect of which is to give to the people, that man, and <HI>that man only,</HI> whom by their voices, actually, not con&s;tructively given, they declare that they know, e&s;teem, love, and tru&s;t. This right is a matter within their own power of judging and feeling; not an <HI>ens rati|onis</HI> and creature of law: nor can tho&s;e devices, by which any thing el&s;e is &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of &s;uch an actual choice, an&s;wer in the lea&s;t degree the end of repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>I know that the courts of law have made as &s;trained con&s;tructions in other ca&s;es. Such is the con&s;truction in common recoveries. The method of con&s;truction which in that ca&s;e gives to the per&s;ons in remainder, for their &s;ecurity and repre&s;entative, the door-keeper, cryer, or &s;weeper of the Court, or &s;ome other &s;nadowy being without &s;ub&s;tance or effect, is a fiction of a very coar&s;e texture. This was however &s;uffered, by the ac|quie&s;cence of the whole kingdom, for ages; becau&s;e the eva&s;ion of the old &s;tatute of We&s;tmin&s;ter, which authori&s;ed perpetuities, had more &s;en&s;e and utility than the law which was evaded. But an attempt to turn the right of election into &s;uch a farce and mockery as a fictitious fine and recovery, will, I hope, have another fate; becau&s;e the laws which give it are infinitely dear to us, and the eva&s;ion is infinitely contemptible.</P>
<P>The people indeed have been told, that this power of di&s;cretionary di&s;|qualification is ve&s;ted in hands that they may tru&s;t, and who will be &s;ure not to abu&s;e it to their prejudice. Until I find &s;omething in this argument di&s;|fering from that on which every mode of de&s;poti&s;m has been defended, I &s;hall not be inclined to pay it any great compliment. The people are &s;a|tisfied to tru&s;t them&s;elves with the exerci&s;e of their own privileges, and do not de&s;ire this kind intervention of the Hou&s;e of Commons to free them from the burthen. They are certainly in the right. They ought not to tru&s;t the Hou&s;e of Commons with a power over their franchi&s;es: becau&s;e the con|&s;titution, which placed two other coordinate powers to controul it, repo&s;ed no &s;uch con&s;idence in that body. It were a folly well de&s;erving &s;ervitude for its puni&s;hment, to be &s;ull of confidence where the laws are &s;ull of di&s;|tru&s;t; and to give to an Hou&s;e of Commons, arrogating to its &s;ole re&s;olu|tion the mo&s;t har&s;h and odious part of legi&s;lative authority, that degree of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which is due only to the Legi&s;lature it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45">
When the Hou&s;e of Commons, in an endeavour to obtain new advantages at the expence of the other orders of the &s;tate, for the benefit of the <HI>Com|mons at large,</HI> have pur&s;ued &s;trong mea&s;ures; if it were not ju&s;t, it was at lea&s;t natural, that the con&s;tituents &s;hould connive at all their proceed|ings; becau&s;e we were our&s;elves ultimately to profit. But when this &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion is urged to us, in a conte&s;t between the repre&s;entatives and our&s;elves, and where nothing can be put into their &s;cale which is not taken from ours, they fancy us to be children when they tell us they are our repre&s;entatives, our own fle&s;h and blood, and that all the &s;tripes they give us are for our good. The very de&s;ire of that body to have &s;uch a tru&s;t contrary to law repo&s;ed in them, &s;hews that they are not worthy of it. They certainly will abu&s;e it; becau&s;e all men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an uncontrolled di&s;cretionary power leading to the aggrandi&s;ement and profit of their own body have always abu&s;ed it: and I &s;ee no particular &s;anctity in our times, that is at all likely, by a miraculous operation, to overrule the cour&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t purpo&s;ely &s;hut our eyes, if we con&s;ider this matter merelyas a conte&s;t between the Hou&s;e of Commons and the Electors. The true conte&s;t is between the Electors of the kingdom and the Crown; the Crown acting by an in&s;trumental Hou&s;e of Commons. It is preci&s;ely the &s;ame, whether the Mini&s;ters of the Crown can di&s;qualify by a dependent Hou&s;e of Com|mons, or by a dependent court of <HI>Star Chamber,</HI> or by a dependent court of King's Bench. If once Members of Parliament can be practically con|vinced, that they do not depend on the affection or opinion of the people for their political being; they will give them&s;elves over, without even an appearance of re&s;erve, to the influence of the Court.</P>
<P>Indeed, a Parliament unconnected with the people, is e&s;&s;ential to a Mini&s;try unconnected with the people; and therefore tho&s;e who &s;aw through what mighty difficulties the interior Mini&s;try waded, and the ex|terior were dragged, in this bu&s;ine&s;s, will conceive of what prodigious importance, the new corps of <HI>King's men</HI> held this principle of occa&s;ional and per&s;onal incapacitation, to the whole body of their de&s;ign.</P>
<P>When the Hou&s;e of Commons was thus made to con&s;ider it&s;elf as the ma&s;ter of its con&s;tituents, there wanted but one thing to &s;ecure that Hou&s;e again&s;t all po&s;&s;ible future deviation towards popularity; an <HI>unlimited</HI> fund of money to be laid out according to the plea&s;ure of the Court.</P>
<P>To compleat the &s;cheme of bringing our Court to a re&s;emblance to the neighbouring Monarchies, it was nece&s;&s;ary, in effect, to de&s;troy tho&s;e ap|propriations of revenue, which &s;eem to limit the property, as the other laws had done the powers, of the Crown. An opportunity for this pur|po&s;e was taken, upon an application to Parliament for payment of the debts of the Civil Li&s;t; which in 1769 had amounted to 513,000<HI>l.</HI> Such application had been made upon former occa&s;ions; but to do it in the former manner would by no means an&s;wer the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46">
Whenever the Crown had come to the Commons to de&s;ire a &s;upply for the di&s;charging of debts due on the Civil Li&s;t; it was always a&s;ked and granted with one of the three following qualifications; &s;ometimes with all of them. Either it was &s;tated, that the revenue had been diverted from its purpo&s;es by Parliament: or that tho&s;e duties had fallen &s;hort of the &s;um for which they were given by Parliament, and that the intention of the Legi&s;lature had not been fulfilled: or that the money required to di&s;|charge the Civil Li&s;t debt, was to be rai&s;ed chargeable on the Civil Li&s;t duties. In the reign of Queen Anne, the Crown was found in debt. The le&s;&s;ening and granting away &s;ome part of her revenue by Parliament was alledged as the cau&s;e of that debt, and pleaded as an equitable ground, &s;uch it cer|tainly was, for di&s;charging it. It does not appear that the duties which were then applied to the ordinary Government produced clear above 580,000<HI>l.</HI> a year; becau&s;e, when they were afterwards granted to George the Fir&s;t, 120,000<HI>l.</HI> was added to complete the whole to 700,000<HI>l.</HI> a year. Indeed it was then a&s;&s;erted, and, I have no doubt, truely, that for many years the net produce did not amount to above 550,000<HI>l.</HI> The Queen's extraordinary charges were be&s;ides very con&s;iderable; equal, at lea&s;t, to any we have known in our time. The application to Parlia|ment was not for an ab&s;olute grant of money; but to empower the Queen to rai&s;e it by borrowing upon the Civil Li&s;t funds.</P>
<P>The Civil Li&s;t debt was twice paid in the reign of George the Fir&s;t. The money was granted upon the &s;ame plan which had been followed in the reign of Queen Anne. The Civil Li&s;t revenues were then mortgaged for the &s;um to be rai&s;ed, and &s;tood charged with the ran&s;om of their own deliverance.</P>
<P>George the Second received an addition to his Civil Li&s;t. Duties were granted for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing 800,000<HI>l.</HI> a year. It was not until he had reigned nineteen years, and after the la&s;t rebellion, that he called upon Parliament for a di&s;charge of the Civil Li&s;t debt. The ex|traordinary charges brought on by the rebellion, account fully for the nece&s;&s;ities of the Crown. However, the extraordinary charges of Govern|ment were not thought a ground &s;it to be relied on.</P>
<P>A deficiency of the Civil Li&s;t duties for &s;everal years before, was &s;tated as the principal, if not the whole, ground on which an application to Par|liament could be ju&s;tified. About this time the produce of the&s;e duties had fallen pretty low, and even upon an average of the whole reign never produced 800,000<HI>l.</HI> a year clear to the Trea&s;ury</P>
<P>That Prince reigned &s;ourteen years afterwards: not only no new de|mands were made; but with &s;o much good order were his revenues and expences regulated, that, although many parts of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Court were upon a larger and more liberal &s;cale than they have been &s;ince, there
<PB N="46" REF="47">
was a con&s;iderable &s;um in hand, on his decea&s;e, amounting to about 170,000<HI>l.</HI> applicable to the &s;ervice of the Civil Li&s;t of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty. So that, if this Reign commenced with a greater charge than u&s;ual, there was enough, and more than enough, abundantly to &s;upply all the extraordinary expence. That the Civil Li&s;t &s;hould have been exceeded in the two former reigns, e&s;pecially in the reign of George the Fir&s;t, was not at all &s;urprizing. His revenue was but 700,000<HI>l.</HI> annually; if it ever produced &s;o much clear. The prodigious and dangerous di&s;affection to the very being of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, and the cau&s;e of a Pretender then powerfully abetted from abroad, produced many demands of an extraordinary nature both abroad and at home. Much management and great expences were nece&s;&s;ary. But the throne of no Prince has &s;tood upon more un&s;haken foundations than that of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>To have exceeded the &s;um given for the Civil Li&s;t, and to have incurred a debt without &s;pecial authority of Parliament, was, <HI>prima facie,</HI> a crimi|nal act: as &s;uch, Mini&s;ters ought naturally rather to have withdrawn it from the in&s;pection, than to have expo&s;ed it to the &s;crutiny, of Parliament. Certainly they ought, of them&s;elves, officiou&s;ly to have come armed with every &s;ort of argument, which, by explaining, could excu&s;e, a matter in it&s;elf of pre&s;umptive guilt. But the terrors of the Hou&s;e of Commons are no longer for Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the peculiar character of the Hou&s;e of Commons, as tru&s;tee of the public pur&s;e, would have led them to call with a punctilious &s;olicitude for every public account, and to have examined into them with the mo&s;t rigorous accuracy.</P>
<P>The capital u&s;e of an account is, that the reality of the charge, the rea&s;on of incurring it, and the ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;charging it, &s;hould all appear antecedent to the payment. No man ever pays fir&s;t, and calls for his account afterwards; becau&s;e he would thereby let out of his hands the principal, and indeed only effectual, means of compelling a full and fair one. But, in national bu&s;ine&s;s, there is an additional rea&s;on for a previous production of every account. It is a check, perhaps the only one, upon a corrupt and prodigal u&s;e of public money. An account after payment is to no rational purpo&s;e an account. However, the Hou&s;e of Commons thought all the&s;e to be antiquated principles; they were of opinion, that the mo&s;t Parliamentary way of proceeding was, to pay fir&s;t what the Court thought proper to demand, and to take its chance for an examina|tion into accounts at &s;ome time of greater lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>The nation had &s;ettled 800,000<HI>l.</HI> a year on the Crown, as &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of its dignity, upon the e&s;timate of its own Mini&s;ters. When Mini&s;ters came to Parliament, and &s;aid that this allowance had not been &s;uf|ficient for the purpo&s;e, and that they had incurred a debt of 500,000<HI>l.</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="48">
would it not have been natural for Parliament fir&s;t to have a&s;ked, how, and by what means, their appropriated allowance came to be in&s;ufficient? Would it not have &s;avoured of &s;ome attention to ju&s;tice, to have &s;een in what periods of Admini&s;tration this debt had been originally incurred? that they might di&s;cover, and, if need were, animadvert on the per&s;ons who were found the mo&s;t culpable? To put their hands upon &s;uch articles of ex|penditure as they thought improper or exce&s;&s;ive, and to &s;ecure, in future, again&s;t &s;uch mi&s;application or exceeding? Accounts for any other purpo&s;es are but a matter of curio&s;ity, and no genuine parliamentary object. All the accounts which could an&s;wer any of the&s;e purpo&s;es were refu&s;ed, or po&s;tponed by previous que&s;tions. Every idea of prevention was rejected, as conveying an improper &s;u&s;picion of the Mini&s;ters of the Crown.</P>
<P>When every leading account had been refu&s;ed, many others were granted with &s;ufficient facility. But with great candour al&s;o, the Hou&s;e was informed, that hardly any of them could be ready until the next &s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;ome of them perhaps not &s;o &s;oon. But, in order firmly to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the precedent of <HI>payment previous to account,</HI> and to form it into a &s;ettled rule of the Hou&s;e, the god in the machine was brought down, nothing le&s;s than the wonder-working <HI>Law of Parliament.</HI> It was alledge'd, that it is the law of Parliament, when any demand comes from the Crown, that the Hou&s;e mu&s;t go immediately into the Committee of Supply; in which Committee it was allowed, that the production and examination of accounts would be quite proper and regular. It was therefore carried, that they &s;hould go into the Committee without delay, and without accounts, in order to examine with great order and regularity things that could not po&s;&s;ibly come before them. After this &s;troke of orderly and Parliamentary wit and humour, they went into the Committee; and very generou&s;ly voted the payment.</P>
<P>There was a circum&s;tance in that debate too remarkable to be over|looked. This debt of the Civil Li&s;t was all along argued upon the &s;ame footing as a debt of the State, contracted upon national authority. Its pay|ment was urged as equally pre&s;&s;ing upon the public faith and honour: and when the whole year's account was &s;tated, in what is called <HI>The Budget,</HI> the Mini&s;try valued them&s;elves on the payment of &s;o much public debt, ju&s;t is if they had di&s;charged 500,000<HI>l.</HI> of navy or exchequer bills. Though, in truth, their payment, from the Sinking Fund, of debt which was never contracted by Parliamentary authority, was, to all intents and purpo&s;es, &s;o much debt incurred. But &s;uch is the pre&s;ent notion of public credit, and payment of debt. No wonder that it produces &s;uch effects.</P>
<P>Nor was the Hou&s;e at all more attentive to a provident &s;ecurity again&s;t future, than it had been to a vindictive retro&s;pect to pa&s;t, mi&s;managements. I &s;hould have thought indeed that a Mini&s;terial promi&s;e, during their own
<PB N="48" REF="49">
continuance in office, might have been given, though this would have been but a poor &s;ecurity for the publick. Mr. Pelham gave &s;uch an a&s;&s;urance, and he kept his word. But nothing was capable of extorting from our Mini&s;ters any thing which had the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to a promi&s;e of con|fining the expences of the Civil Li&s;t within the limits which had been &s;ettled by Parliament. This re&s;erve of theirs I look upon to be equivalent to the cleare&s;t declaration, that they were re&s;olved upon a contrary cour&s;e.</P>
<P>However, to put the matter beyond all doubt, in the Speech from the Throne, after thanking Parliament for the relief &s;o liberally granted, the Mini&s;ters inform the two Hou&s;es, that they will <HI>endeavour</HI> to confine the expences of the Civil Government&mdash;within what limits think you? Tho&s;e which the law had pre&s;cribed? Not in the lea&s;t.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;uch limits as the <HI>honour of the Crown</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly admit."</Q></P>
<P>Thus they e&s;tabli&s;hed an <HI>arbitrary</HI> &s;tandard for that dignity which Parli|ament had defined and limited to a <HI>legal</HI> &s;tandard. They gave them&s;elves under the lax and indeterminate idea of the <HI>Honour of the Crown,</HI> a full loo&s;e for all manner of di&s;&s;ipation, and all manner of corruption. This arbitrary &s;tandard they were not afraid to hold out to both Hou&s;es.; while an idle and unoperative Act of Parliament, e&s;timating the dignity of the Crown at 800,000<HI>l.</HI> and confining it to that &s;um, adds to the number of ob&s;olete &s;tatutes which load the &s;helves of libraries without any &s;ort of advantage to the people.</P>
<P>After this proceeding, I &s;uppo&s;e that no man can be &s;o weak as to think that the Crown is limited to any &s;ettled allowance what&s;oever. For if the Mini&s;try has 800,000<HI>l.</HI> a year by the law of the land; and if by the law of Parliament all the debts which exceed it are to be paid previous to the production of any account; I pre&s;ume that this is equivalent to an income with no other limits than the abilities of the &s;ubject and the moderation of the Court; that is to &s;ay, it is &s;uch an income as is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by every ab|&s;olute Monarch in Europe. It amounts, as a per&s;on of great ability &s;aid in the debate, to an unlimited power of drawing upon the Sinking Fund. Its effect on the public credit of this kingdom mu&s;t be obvious; for in vain is the Sinking Fund the great buttre&s;s of all the re&s;t, if it be in the power of the Mini&s;try to re&s;ort to it for the payment of any debts which they may choo&s;e to incur, under the name of the Civil Li&s;t, and through the medium of a Committee, which thinks it&s;elf obliged by law to vote &s;upplies without any other account than that of the mere exi&s;tence of the debt.</P>
<P>Five hundred thou&s;and pounds is a &s;erious &s;um. But it is nothing to the prolific principle upon which the &s;um was voted; a principle that may be well called, <HI>the fruitful mother of an hundred more.</HI> Neither is the damage to public credit of very great con&s;equence, when compared with that which re&s;ults to public morals and to the &s;afety of the con&s;titution, from the ex|hau&s;tle&s;s
<PB N="49" REF="50">
mine of corruption opened by the precedent, and to be wrought by the principle, of the late payment of the debts of the Civil Li&s;t. The power of di&s;cretionary di&s;qualification by one law of Parliament, and the nece&s;&s;ity of paying every debt of the Civil Li&s;t by another law of Parliament, if &s;uffered to pa&s;s unnoticed, mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a fund of rewards and terrors as will make Parliament the be&s;t appendage and &s;upport of arbitrary power that ever was invented by the wit of man. This is felt. The quarrel is begun between the Repre&s;entatives and the People. The Court faction have at length committed them.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;trait the wi&s;e&s;t may well be perplexed, and the bolde&s;t &s;tag|gered. The circum&s;tances are in a great mea&s;ure new. We have hardly any land-marks from the wi&s;dom of our ance&s;tors, to guide us. At be&s;t we can only follow the &s;pirit of their proceeding in other ca&s;es. I know the diligence with which my ob&s;ervations on our public di&s;orders have been made; I am very &s;ure of the integrity of the motives on which they are publi&s;hed; I cannot be equally confident in any plan for the ab&s;olute cure of tho&s;e di&s;orders, or for their certain future prevention. My aim is to bring this matter into more public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Let the &s;agacity of others work upon it. It is not uncommon for medical writers to de&s;cribe hi&s;tories of di&s;ea&s;es very accurately, on who&s;e cure they can &s;ay but very little.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ideas which generally &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves, for the cure of Parlia|mentary di&s;orders, are, to &s;horten the duration of Parliaments; and to di&s;|qualify all, or a great number of placemen, from a &s;eat in the Hou&s;e of Commons. Whatever efficacy there may be in tho&s;e remedies, I am &s;ure in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things it is impo&s;&s;ible to apply them. A re&s;toration of the right of free election is a preliminary indi&s;pen&s;able to every other reformation. What alterations ought afterwards to be made in the con|&s;titution, is a matter of deep and difficult re&s;earch.</P>
<P>If I wrote merely to plea&s;e the popular palate, it would indeed be as little trouble&s;ome to me as to another, to extol the&s;e remedies, &s;o famous in &s;peculation, but to which their greate&s;t admirers have never attempted &s;eriou&s;ly to re&s;ort in practice. I confe&s;s then, that I have no &s;ort of re|liance upon either a Triennial Parliament, or a Place-bill. With regard to the former, perhaps it might rather &s;erve to counteract, than to promote the ends that are propo&s;ed by it. To &s;ay nothing of the horrible di&s;orders among the people attending frequent elections, I &s;hould be fearful of com|mitting, every three years, the independent gentlemen of the country into a conte&s;t with the Trea&s;ury. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee which of the contending parties would be ruined fir&s;t. Whoever has taken a careful view of public pro|ceedings, &s;o as to endeavour to ground his &s;peculations on his experience, mu&s;t have ob&s;erved how prodigiou&s;ly greater the power of Mini&s;try is in the fir&s;t and la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of a Parliament, than it is in the intermediate period, when
<PB N="50" REF="51">
Members &s;it a little firm on their &s;eats. The per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Parli|amentary experience, with whom I have conver&s;ed, did con&s;tantly, in can|va&s;&s;ing the fate of que&s;tions, allow &s;omething to the Court-&s;ide, upon ac|count of the elections depending or imminent. The evil complained of, if it exi&s;ts in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, would hardly be removed by a triennial Parliament: for, unle&s;s the influence of Government in elections can be entire|ly taken away, the more frequently they return, the more they will harra&s;s private independence; the more generally men will be compelled to fly to the &s;ettled, &s;y&s;tematic intere&s;t of Government, and to the re&s;ources of a boundle&s;s Civil Li&s;t. Certainly &s;omething may be done, and ought to be done, towards le&s;&s;ening that influence in elections; and this will be nece&s;&s;ary upon a plan either of longer or &s;horter duration of Parliament. But nothing can &s;o perfectly remove the evil, as not to render &s;uch contentions, too frequently repeated, utterly ruinous, fir&s;t to independence of fortune, and then to independence of &s;pirit. As I am only giving an opinion on this point, and not at all debating it in an adver&s;e line, I hope I may be ex|cu&s;ed in another ob&s;ervation. With great truth I may aver, that I never remember to have talked on this &s;ubject with any man much conver&s;ant with public bu&s;ine&s;s, who con&s;idered &s;hort Parliaments as a real improve|ment of the con&s;titution. Gentlemen, warm in a popular cau&s;e, are ready enough to attribute all the declarations of &s;uch per&s;ons to corrupt motives. But the habit of affairs, if, on one hand, it tends to corrupt the mind, furni&s;hes it, on the other, with the means of better information. The authority of &s;uch per&s;ons will always have &s;ome weight. It may &s;tand upon a par with the &s;peculations of tho&s;e who are le&s;s practi&s;ed in bu&s;ine&s;s; and who, with perhaps purer intentions, have not &s;o effectual means of judging. It is, be&s;ides, an effect of vulgar and puerile malignity to imagine, that every State&s;man is of cour&s;e corrupt; and that his opinion, upon every con&s;titutional point, is &s;olely formed upon &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The next favourite remedy is a place-bill. The &s;ame principle guides in both; I mean, the opinion which is entertained by many, of the infalli|bility of laws and regulations, in the cure of public di&s;tempers. With|out being as unrea&s;onably doubtful as many are unwi&s;ely confident, I will only &s;ay, that this al&s;o is a matter very well worthy of &s;erious and mature reflexion. It is not ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, what the effect would be, of di&s;connecting with Parliament, the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who hold civil employments, and of &s;uch mighty and important bodies as the military and naval e&s;tabli&s;hments. It were better, perhaps, that they &s;hould have a corrupt intere&s;t in the forms of the con&s;titution, than that they &s;hould have none at all. This is a que&s;tion altogether different from the di&s;qua|lification of a particular de&s;cription of Revenue Officers from &s;eats in Parliament; or, perhaps, of all the lower &s;orts of them from
<PB N="51" REF="52">
votes in elections. In the former ca&s;e, only the few are affected; in the latter, only the incon&s;iderable. But a great official, a great profe&s;&s;ional, a great military and naval intere&s;t, all nece&s;&s;arily comprehending many people of the fir&s;t weight, ability, wealth, and &s;pirit, has been gra|dually formed in the kingdom. The&s;e new intere&s;ts mu&s;t be let into a &s;hare of repre&s;entation, el&s;e po&s;&s;ibly they may be inclined to de&s;troy tho&s;e in&s;titutions of which they are not permitted to partake. This is not a thing to be trifled with; nor is it every well-meaning man, that is fit to put his hands to it. Many other &s;erious con&s;iderations occur. I do not open them here, becau&s;e they are not directly to my purpo&s;e; propo&s;ing only to give the reader &s;ome ta&s;te of the difficulties that attend all capital changes in the con&s;titution; ju&s;t to hint the uncertainty, to &s;ay no wor&s;e, of pre|venting the Court, as long as it has the means of influence abundantly in its power, of applying that influence to Parliament; and perhaps, if the public method were precluded, of doing it in &s;ome wor&s;e and more dangerous method. Underhand and oblique ways would be &s;tudied. The &s;cien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e of eva&s;ion, already tolerably under&s;tood, would then be brought to the greate&s;t perfection. It is no incon&s;iderable part of wi&s;dom, to know how much of an evil ought to be tolerated; le&s;t, by attempting a degree of purity imprac|ticable in degenerate times and manners, in&s;tead of cutting off the &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting ill practices, new corruptions might be produced for the conceal|ment and &s;ecurity of the old. It were better, undoubtedly, that no in|fluence at all could affect the mind of a Member of Parliament. But of all modes of influence, in my opinion, a place under the Government is the lea&s;t di&s;graceful to the man who holds it, and by far the mo&s;t &s;afe to the country. I would not &s;hut out that &s;ort of influence which is open and vi&s;ible, which is connected with the dignity and the &s;ervice of the State, when it is not in my power to prevent the influence of contracts, of &s;ub|&s;criptions, of direct bribery, and tho&s;e innumerable methods of clande&s;tine corruption, which are abundantly in the hands of the Court, and which will be applied as long as the&s;e means of corruption, and the di&s;po&s;ition to be corrupted, have exi&s;tence among&s;t us. Our con&s;titution &s;tands on a nice equipoi&s;e, with &s;teep precipices, and deep waters upon all &s;ides of it. In removing it from a dangerous leaning towards one &s;ide, there may be a ri&s;que of over&s;etting it on the other. Every project of a material change in a Government &s;o complicated as ours, combined at the &s;ame time with external circum&s;tances &s;till more complicated, is a matter full of difficulties; in which a con&s;iderate man will not be too ready to decide; a prudent man too ready to undertake; or an hone&s;t man too ready to promi&s;e. They do not re&s;pect the publick nor them&s;elves, who engage for more, than they are &s;ure that they ought to attempt, or that they are able to perform. The&s;e are my &s;entiments, weak perhaps, but hone&s;t and unbia&s;&s;ed; and
<PB N="52" REF="53">
&s;ubmitted, entirely to the opinion of grave men, well affected to the con|&s;titution of their country, and of experience in what may be&s;t promote or hurt it.</P>
<P>Indeed, in the &s;ituation in which we &s;tand, with an immen&s;e revenue, an enormous debt, mighty e&s;tabli&s;hments, Government it&s;elf a great banker and a great merchant, I &s;ee no other way for the pre&s;ervation of a decent at|tention to public intere&s;t in the Repre&s;entatives, but <HI>the interpo&s;ition of the body of the people it&s;elf,</HI> whenever it &s;hall appear, by &s;ome flagrant and no|torious act, by &s;ome capital innovation, that the&s;e Repre&s;entatives are going to over-leap the fences of the law, and to introduce an arbitrary power. This interpo&s;ition is a mo&s;t unplea&s;ant remedy. But, if it is a legal remedy, it is intended on &s;ome occa&s;ion to be u&s;ed; to be u&s;ed then only, when it is evident that nothing el&s;e can hold the con&s;titution to its true principles.</P>
<P>The di&s;tempers of Monarchy were the great &s;ubjects of apprehen&s;ion and redre&s;s, in the la&s;t century; in this the di&s;tempers of Parliament. It is not in Parliament alone that the remedy for Parliamentary di&s;orders can be compleated; hardly indeed can it begin there. Until a confidence in Government is re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, the people ought to be excited to a more &s;trict and detailed attention to the conduct of their Repre&s;entatives. Standards, for judging more &s;y&s;tematically upon their conduct, ought to be &s;ettled in the meetings of counties and corporations. Frequent and correct li&s;ts of the voters in all important que&s;tions ought to be procured.</P>
<P>By &s;uch means &s;omething may be done. By &s;uch means it may appear who tho&s;e are, that, by an indi&s;criminate &s;upport of all Admini&s;trations, have totally bani&s;hed all integrity and confidence out of public proceed|ings; have confounded the be&s;t men with the wor&s;t; and weakened and di&s;&s;olved, in&s;tead of &s;trengthening and compacting, the general frame of Government. If any per&s;on is more concerned for government and order, than for the liberties of his country; even he is equally concerned to put an end to this cour&s;e of indi&s;criminate &s;upport. It is this blind and undi&s;tingui&s;hing &s;upport, that feeds the &s;pring of tho&s;e very di&s;orders, by which he is frighted into the arms of that faction which con|tains in it&s;elf the &s;ource of all di&s;orders by enfeebling all the vi&s;ible and re|gular authority of the &s;tate. The di&s;temper is encrea&s;ed by his, judicious and prepo&s;terous endeavours, or pretences for the cure of it.</P>
<P>An exterior Admini&s;tration cho&s;en for its impotency, or after it is cho&s;en purpo&s;ely rendered impotent, in order to be rendered &s;ub&s;ervient, will not be obeyed. The laws them&s;elves will not be re&s;pected when tho&s;e who execute them are de&s;pi&s;ed; and they will be de&s;pi&s;ed, when their power is not immediate from the Crown, or natural in the king|dom. Never were mini&s;ters better &s;upported in Parliament. Parli|amentary
<PB N="53" REF="54">
&s;upport comes and goes with office, totally regardle&s;s of the man, or the merit. Is Government &s;trengthened? It grows weaker and weaker; the popular torrent gains upon it every hour. Let us learn from our experience. It is not &s;upport that is wanting to Government, but re|formation. When Mini&s;try re&s;ts upon publick opinion, it is not indeed built upon a rock of adamant; but when it &s;tands upon private humour, its &s;tructure is of &s;tubble, and its foundation is on quick&s;and. I repeat it again. He that &s;upports every Admini&s;tration, &s;ubverts all Government. As the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, in which Courts u&s;ually take an intere&s;t, goes on at pre&s;ent equally well, in whatever hands, whether high or low, wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, &s;candalous or reputable; there is nothing to hold it firm to any one body of men, or to any one con&s;i&s;tents cheme of politicks. Nothing interpo&s;es, to prevent the full operation of all the caprices and all the pa&s;&s;ions of a Court upon the &s;ervants of the publick. The &s;y&s;tem of Admini&s;tration is therefore open to continual &s;hocks and changes, upon the principles of the meane&s;t cabal, and the mo&s;t contemptible in|trigue. Nothing can be &s;olid and permanent. All good men at length fly with horrour from &s;uch a &s;ervice. Men of rank and ability, with the &s;pirit which ought to animate &s;uch men in a free &s;tate, while they decline the juri&s;diction of dark cabal on their actions and their fortunes, will, for both, chearfully put them&s;elves upon their country. They will tru&s;t an inqui&s;itive and di&s;tingui&s;hing Parliament; becau&s;e it does enquire, and does di&s;tingui&s;h; if they act well, they know, that in &s;uch a Parliament, they will be &s;upported again&s;t any intrigue; if they act ill, they know that no intrigue can protect them. This &s;ituation, however aweful, is honourable. But in one hour, and in the &s;elf-&s;ame A&s;&s;embly, without any a&s;&s;igned or a&s;&s;ignable cau&s;e, to be precipitated from the highe&s;t authority to the mo&s;t marked neglect, po&s;&s;ibly into the greate&s;t peril of life and reputation, is a &s;ituation full of danger, and de&s;titute of honour. It will be &s;hunned equally by every man of prudence, and every man of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Such are the con&s;equences of the divi&s;ion of the Court from the Admi|ni&s;tration; and of the divi&s;ion of public men among them&s;elves. By the former of the&s;e, lawful Government is undone; by the latter, all oppo|&s;ition to lawle&s;s power is rendered impotent. Government may in a great mea&s;ure be re&s;tored, if any con&s;iderable bodies of men have hone&s;ty and re&s;olution enough never to accept Admini&s;tration, unle&s;s this garri&s;on of <HI>King's men,</HI> which is &s;tationed, as in a citadel, to controul and en&s;lave it, be entirely broken and di&s;banded, and every work they have thrown up be leveled with the ground. The di&s;po&s;ition of public men to keep this corps together, and to act under it, or to co-operate with it, is a touch&s;tone by which every Admini&s;tration ought in future to be tried.
<PB N="54" REF="55">
There has not been one which has not &s;ufficiently experienced the utter in|compatibility of that faction with the public peace, and with all the ends of good Government: &s;ince, if they oppo&s;ed it, they &s;oon lo&s;t every power of &s;erving the Crown; if they &s;ubmitted to it, they lo&s;t all the e&s;teem of their country. Until Mini&s;ters give to the publick a full proof of their entire alienation from that &s;y&s;tem, however plau&s;ible their pre|tences, we may be &s;ure they are more intent on the emoluments than the duties of office. If they refu&s;e to give this proof, we know of what &s;tuff they are made. In this particular, it ought to be the electors bu&s;ine&s;s to look to their Repre&s;entatives. The electors ought to e&s;teem it no le&s;s culpable in their member to give a &s;ingle vote in Parliament to &s;uch an Ad|mini&s;tration than to take an office under it; to endure it than to act in it. The notorious infidelity and ver&s;atility of Members of Parliament in their opinions of men and things ought in a particular manner to be con|&s;idered by the electors in the inquiry which is recommended to them. This is one of the principal holdings of that de&s;tructive &s;y&s;tem, which has en|deavoured to unhinge all the virtuous, honourable, and u&s;eful connexions in the kingdom.</P>
<P>This cabal has, with great &s;ucce&s;s, propagated a doctrine which &s;erves for a colour to tho&s;e acts of treachery; and whil&s;t it receives any degree of countenance, it will be utterly &s;en&s;ele&s;s to look for a vigorous oppo&s;ition to the Court party. The doctrine is this: That all political con|nexions are in their nature factious, and as &s;uch ought to be di&s;&s;ipated, and de&s;troyed; and that the rule for forming Admini&s;trations is mere per&s;onal ability (on the judgement of this cabal upon it) taken by draughts from every divi&s;ion and denomination of public men. This decree was &s;olemnly promulgated by the head of the Court corps, the Earl of Bute him&s;elf, in a &s;peech which he made, in the year 1766, again&s;t the then Admini&s;tration, the only Admini&s;tration which he has ever been known directly and publicly to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is indeed in no way wonderful, that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould make &s;uch declarations. That connexion and faction are equivalent terms, is an opi|nion which has been carefully inculcated at all times by uncon&s;titutional State&s;men. The rea&s;on is evident. Whil&s;t men are linked together, they ea&s;ily and &s;peedily communicate the alarm of any evil de&s;ign. They are enabled to &s;athom it with common coun&s;el, and to oppo&s;e it with united &s;trength. Whereas, when they lie di&s;per&s;ed, without concert, order, or di&s;cipline, communication is uncertain, coun&s;el difficult, and re&s;i&s;tance impracticable. Where men are not acquainted with each other's principles, nor experienced in each other's talents, nor at all practi&s;ed in their mutual habitudes and di&s;po&s;itions by joint efforts in bu|&s;ine&s;s; no per&s;onal confidence, no friend&s;hip, no common intere&s;t, &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing

among them; it is evidently impo&s;&s;ible that they can act a public part with uniformity, per&s;everance, or efficacy. In a connexion, the mo&s;t incon|&s;iderable man, by adding to the weight of the whole, has his value, and his u&s;e; out of it, the greate&s;t talents are wholly un&s;erviceable to the pub|lick. No man, who is not inflamed by vain-glory into enthu&s;ia&s;m, can flatter him&s;elf that his &s;ingle, un&s;upported, de&s;ultory, un&s;y&s;tematic endeavours are of power to defeat the &s;ubtle de&s;igns and united cabals of ambitious citizens. When bad men combine, the good mu&s;t a&s;&s;ociate; el&s;e they will fall, one by one, an unpitied &s;acrifice in a contemptible &s;truggle.</P>
<P>It is not enough, in a &s;ituation of tru&s;t in the commonwealth, that a man means well to his country; it is not enough that in his &s;ingle per&s;on he never did an evil act, but always voted according to his con&s;cience, and even ha|rangued again&s;t every de&s;ign which he apprehended to be prejudicial to the intere&s;ts of his country. This innoxious and ineffectual character, that &s;eems formed upon a plan of apology and di&s;culpation, falls mi&s;erably &s;hort of the mark of public duty. That duty demands and requires, that what is right &s;hould not only be made known, but made prevalent; that what is evil &s;hould not only be detected, but defeated. When the public man omits to put him&s;elf in a &s;ituation of doing his duty with effect, it is an omi&s;&s;ion that fru&s;trates the purpo&s;es of his tru&s;t almo&s;t as much as if he had formally betrayed it. It is &s;urely no very rational account of a man's life, that he has always acted right; but has taken &s;pecial care, to act in &s;uch a manner that his endeavours could not po&s;&s;ibly be productive of any con&s;equence.</P>
<P>I do not wonder that the behaviour of many parties &s;hould have made per&s;ons of tender and &s;crupulous virtue &s;omewhat out of humour with all &s;orts of connexion in politicks. I admit that people frequently acquire in &s;uch confederacies a narrow, bigoted, and pro&s;criptive &s;pirit; that they are apt to &s;ink the idea of the general good in this circum&s;cribed and partial intere&s;t. But, where duty renders a critical &s;ituation a nece&s;&s;ary one, it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to keep free from the evils attendant upon it; and not to fly from the &s;ituation it&s;elf. If a fortre&s;s is &s;eated in an unwhole|&s;ome air, an officer of the garri&s;on is obliged to be attentive to his health, but he mu&s;t not de&s;ert his &s;tation. Every profe&s;&s;ion, not excepting the glorious one of a &s;oldier, or the &s;acred one of a prie&s;t, is liable to its own particular vices; which, however, form no argument again&s;t tho&s;e ways of li&s;e; nor are the vices them&s;elves inevitable to every individual in tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions. Of &s;uch a nature are connexions in politicks; e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the full performance of our public duty, accidentally liable to degenerate into faction. Commonwealths are made of families, free com|monwealths of parties al&s;o; and we may as well affirm, that our natural regards and ties of blood tend inevitably to make men bad citizens, as that the bonds of our party weaken tho&s;e by which we are held to our country.</P>

Some legi&s;lators went &s;o far as to make neutrality in party a crime again&s;t the State. I do not know whether this might not have been rather to over&s;train the principle. Certain it is, the be&s;t patriots in the greate&s;t commonwealths have always commended and promoted &s;uch connexions. <HI>Idem &s;entire de republica,</HI> was with them a principal ground of friend&s;hip and attachment; nor do I know any other capable of forming firmer, dearer, more plea&s;ing, more honourable, and more virtuous habitudes. The Romans carried this principle a great way. Even the holding of offices together, the di&s;po&s;ition of which aro&s;e from chance not &s;election, gave ri&s;e to a relation, which continued for life. It was called <HI>nece&s;&s;itudo &s;ortis;</HI> and it was looked upon with a &s;acred reverence. Breaches of any of the&s;e kinds of civil relation were con&s;idered as acts of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed turpitude. The whole people was di&s;tributed into political &s;ocieties, in which they acted in &s;upport of &s;uch intere&s;ts in the State as they &s;everally affected. For it was then thought no crime, to endea|vour by every hone&s;t means to advance to &s;uperiority and power tho&s;e of your own &s;entiments and opinions. This wi&s;e people was far from imagin|ing that tho&s;e connexions had no tie, and obliged to no duty; but that men might quit them without &s;hame, upon every call of intere&s;t. They believed private honour to be the great foundation of public tru&s;t; that friend&s;hip was no mean &s;tep towards patrioti&s;m; that he who, in the com|mon intercour&s;e of life, &s;hewed he regarded &s;omebody be&s;ides him&s;elf, when he came to act in a public &s;ituation, might probably con&s;ult &s;ome other intere&s;t than his own. Never may we become <HI>plus &s;ages que les &s;ages,</HI> as the French comedian has happily expre&s;&s;ed it, wi&s;er than all the wi&s;e and good men who have lived before us. It was their wi&s;h, to &s;ee public and private virtues, not di&s;&s;onant and jarring, and mutually de&s;tructive, but harmoniou&s;ly combined, growing out of one another in a noble and orderly gradation, reciprocally &s;upporting and &s;upported. In one of the mo&s;t fortu|nate periods of our hi&s;tory this country was governed by a <HI>connexion;</HI> I mean, the great connexion of Whigs in the reign of Q. Anne. They were complimented upon the principle of this connexion by a Poet who was in high e&s;teem with them. Addi&s;on, who knew their &s;entiments, could not prai&s;e them for what they con&s;idered as no proper &s;ubject of commendation.

The Whigs of tho&s;e days believed that the only proper method of ri&s;ing into power was through hard e&s;&s;ays of practi&s;ed friend&s;hip and experimented fidelity. At that time it was not imagined, that patrioti&s;m was a bloody idol, which required the &s;acrifice of children and parents, or deare&s;t con|nexions in private life, and of all the virtues that ri&s;e from tho&s;e relations. They were not of that ingenious paradoxical morality, to imagine that a &s;pirit of moderation was properly &s;hewn in patiently bearing the &s;ufferings of your friends; or that di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s was clearly manife&s;ted at the expence of other peoples fortune. They believed that no men could act with effect, who did not act in concert; that no men could act in concert, who did not act with confidence; and that no men could act with confi|dence, who were not bound together by common opinions, common affections, and common intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The&s;e wi&s;e men, for &s;uch I mu&s;t call Lord Sunderland, Lord Godol|phin, Lord Sommers, and Lord Marlborough, were too well principled in the&s;e maxims upon which the whole fabrick of public &s;trength is built, to be blown off their ground by the breath of every childi&s;h talker. They were not afraid that they &s;hould be called an ambitious junto, or that their re&s;olution to &s;tand or fall together &s;hould, by placemen, be interpreted into a &s;cuffle for places.</P>
<P>Party is a body of men united, for promoting by their joint endeavours the national intere&s;t, upon &s;ome particular principle in which they are all agreed. For my part, I find it impo&s;&s;ible to conceive, that any one believes in his own politicks, or thinks them to be of any weight, who refu&s;es to adopt the means of having them reduced into practice. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;peculative philo&s;opher to mark the proper ends of Government. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the politician, who is the philo&s;opher in action, to find out proper means towards tho&s;e ends, and to employ them with effect. Therefore every honourable connexion will avow it as their fir&s;t purpo&s;e, to pur&s;ue every ju&s;t method to put the men who hold their opinions into &s;uch a condition as may enable them to carry their common plans into execution, with all the power and authority of the State. As this power is attached to certain &s;ituations, it is their duty to contend for the&s;e &s;ituations. Without a pro&s;cription of others, they are bound to give to their own party the preference in all things; and by no means, for pri|vate con&s;iderations, to accept any offers of power in which the whole body is not included; nor to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be led, or to be controlled, or to be over-balanced, in office or in council, by tho&s;e who contradict the very fundamental principles on which their party is formed, and even tho&s;e upon which every fair connexion mu&s;t &s;tand. Such a generous contention for power, on &s;uch manly and honourable maxims, will ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the mean and intere&s;ted &s;truggle for place and emolument. The
<PB N="58" REF="59">
very &s;tile of &s;uch per&s;ons will &s;erve to di&s;criminate them from tho&s;e numberle&s;s impo&s;tors, who have deluded the ignorant with profe&s;&s;ions in|compatible with human practice, and have afterwards incen&s;ed them by practices below the level of vulgar rectitude.</P>
<P>It is an advantage to all narrow wi&s;dom and narrow morals, that their maxims have a plau&s;ible air; and, on a cur&s;ory view, appear equal to fir&s;t principles. They are light and portable. They are as current as copper|coin; and about as valuable. They &s;erve equally the fir&s;t capacities and the lowe&s;t; and they are, at lea&s;t, as u&s;eful to the wor&s;t men as the be&s;t. Of this &s;tamp is the cant of <HI>Not men, but mea&s;ures;</HI> a &s;ort of charm, by which many people get loo&s;e from every honourable engagement. When I &s;ee a man acting this de&s;ultory and di&s;connected part, with as much detriment to his own fortune as prejudice to the cau&s;e of any party, I am not per&s;uaded that he is right; but I am ready to believe he is in earne&s;t. I re&s;pect virtue in all its &s;ituations; even when it is found in the un&s;uitable com|pany of weakne&s;s. I lament to &s;ee qualities, rare and valuable, &s;quandered away without any public utility. But when a gentleman with great vi&s;i|ble emoluments abandons the party in which he has long acted, and tells you, it is becau&s;e he proceeds upon his own judgement; that he acts on the merits of the &s;everal mea&s;ures as they ari&s;e; and that he is obliged to follow his own con&s;cience, and not that of others; he gives rea&s;ons which it is impo&s;&s;ible to controvert, and di&s;covers a character which it is impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take. What &s;hall we think of him who never differed from a certain &s;et of men until the moment they lo&s;t their power, and who never agreed with them in a &s;ingle in&s;tance afterwards? Would not &s;uch a coincidence of intere&s;t and opinion be rather fortunate? Would it not be an extraordinary ca&s;t upon the dice, that a man's connexions &s;hould degenerate into faction, preci&s;ely at the critical moment when they lo&s;e their power, or he accepts a place? When people de&s;ert their connex|ions, the de&s;ertion is a manife&s;t <HI>fact,</HI> upon which a direct &s;imple i&s;&s;ue lies, triable by plain men. Whether a <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> of Government be right or wrong, is <HI>no matter of fact,</HI> but a mere affair of opinion, on which men may, as they do, di&s;pute and wrangle without end. But whether the individual <HI>thinks</HI> the mea&s;ure right or wrong, is a point at &s;till a greater di&s;tance from the reach of all human deci&s;ion. It is therefore very convenient to politicians, not to put the judgement of their conduct on overt-acts, cognizable in any ordinary court, but upon &s;uch matter as can be triable only in that &s;ecret tribunal, where they are &s;ure of being heard with &s;avour, or where at wor&s;t the &s;entence will be only private whipping.</P>
<P>I believe the reader would wi&s;h to find no &s;ub&s;tance in a doctrine which has a tendency to de&s;troy all te&s;t of character as deduced from conduct.
<PB N="59" REF="60">
He will therefore excu&s;e my adding &s;omething more, towards the further clearing up a point, which the great convenience of ob&s;curity to di&s;hone&s;ty has been able to cover with &s;ome degree of darkne&s;s and doubt.</P>
<P>In order to throw an odium on political connexion, the&s;e politicians &s;uppo&s;e it a nece&s;&s;ary incident to it, that you are blindly to follow the opinions of your party when in direct oppo&s;ition to your own clear ideas; a degree of &s;ervitude that no worthy man could bear the thought of &s;ub|mitting to; and &s;uch as, I believe, no connexions (except &s;ome Court fac|tions) ever could be &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;sly tyrannical as to impo&s;e. Men thinking freely, will, in particular in&s;tances, think differently. But &s;till, as the greater part of the mea&s;ures which ari&s;e in the cour&s;e of public bu&s;ine&s;s are related to, or dependent on, &s;ome great <HI>leading general principles in Government,</HI> a man mu&s;t be peculiarly unfortunate in the choice of his political company if he does not agree with them at lea&s;t nine times in ten. If he does not concur in the&s;e general principles upon which the party is founded, and which nece&s;&s;arily draw on a concurrence in their ap|plication, he ought from the beginning to have cho&s;en &s;ome other, more conformable to his opinions. When the que&s;tion is in its nature doubt|ful, or not very material, the mode&s;ty which becomes an individual, and (in &s;pite of our Court morali&s;ts) that partiality which becomes a well|cho&s;en friend&s;hip, will frequently bring on an acquie&s;cence in the general &s;entiment. Thus the di&s;agreement will naturally be rare; it will be only enough to indulge freedom, without violating concord or di&s;turbing ar|rangement. And this is all that ever was required for a character of the greate&s;t uniformity and &s;teadine&s;s in connexion. How men can proceed without any connexion at all, is to me utterly incomprehen&s;ible. Of what &s;ort of materials mu&s;t that man be made, how mu&s;t he be tempered and put together, who can &s;it whole years in Parliament, with five hundred and fifty of his fellow citizens, amid&s;t the &s;torm of &s;uch tempe&s;tuous pa&s;&s;ions, in the &s;harp conflict of &s;o many wits, and tempers, and cha|racters, in the agitation of &s;uch mighty que&s;tions, in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of &s;uch va&s;t and ponderous intere&s;ts, without &s;eeing any one &s;ort of men, who&s;e character, conduct, or di&s;po&s;ition, would lead him to a&s;&s;ociate him&s;elf with them, to aid and be aided in any one &s;y&s;tem of public utility?</P>
<P>I remember an old &s;chola&s;tic aphori&s;m, which &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the man who lives wholly detached from others, mu&s;t be either an angel or a devil."</Q> When I &s;ee in any of the&s;e detached gentlemen of our times the angelic purity, power, and beneficence, I &s;hall admit them to be angels. In the mean time we are born only to be men. We &s;hall do enough if we form our&s;elves to be good ones. It is therefore our bu&s;ine&s;s carefully to cultivate in our minds, to rear to the mo&s;t perfect vigour and
<PB N="60" REF="61">
maturity, every &s;ort of generous and hone&s;t feeling that belongs to our nature. To bring the di&s;po&s;itions that are lovely in private life into the &s;ervice and conduct of the commonwealth; &s;o to be patriots, as not to forget we are gentlemen. To cultivate friend&s;hips, and to incur enmities. To have both &s;trong, but both &s;elected: in the one, to be placable; in the other, immoveable. To model our principles to our duties and our &s;itu|ation. To be fully per&s;uaded, that all virtue which is impracticable is &s;purious; and rather to run the ri&s;que of falling into faults in a cour&s;e which leads us to act with effect and energy, than to loiter out our days without blame, and without u&s;e. Public life is a &s;ituation of power and energy; he tre&s;pa&s;&s;es again&s;t his duty who &s;leeps upon his watch, as well as he that goes over to the enemy.</P>
<P>There is, however, a time for all things. It is not every conjuncture which calls with equal force upon the activity of hone&s;t men; but critical exigences now and then ari&s;e; and I am mi&s;taken, if this be not one of them. Men will &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of hone&s;t combination; but they may &s;ee it when it is too late. They may embody, when it will be ruinous to them&s;elves, and of no advantage to the country; when, for want of &s;uch a timely union as may enable them to oppo&s;e in favour of the laws, with the laws on their &s;ide, they may, at length, find them&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;piring, in&s;tead of con&s;ulting. The law, for which they &s;tand, may become a weapon in the hands of its bittere&s;t enemies; and they will be ca&s;t, at length, into that mi&s;erable alternative, between &s;lavery and civil confu&s;ion, which no good man can look upon without hor|ror; an alternative in which it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould take either part, with a con&s;cience perfectly at repo&s;e. To keep that &s;ituation of guilt and remor&s;e at the utmo&s;t di&s;tance, is, therefore, our fir&s;t obligation. Early activity may prevent late and fruitle&s;s violence. As yet we work in the light. The &s;cheme of the enemies of public tranquillity has di&s;|arranged, it has not de&s;troyed us.</P>
<P>If the reader believes that there really exi&s;ts &s;uch a faction as I have de&s;cribed; a faction ruling by the private inclinations of a Court, again&s;t the general &s;en&s;e of the people; and that this faction, whil&s;t it pur&s;ues a &s;cheme for undermining all the foundations of our freedom, weakens (for the pre&s;ent at lea&s;t) all the powers of executory Government, rendering us abroad contemptible, and at home di&s;tracted; he will believe al&s;o, that nothing but a firm combination of public men again&s;t this body, and that, too, &s;upported by the hearty concurrence of the people at large, can po&s;&s;ibly get the better of it. The people will &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;toring public men to an attention to the public opinion, and of re&s;toring the con&s;titution to its original principles. Above all, they will endeavour to keep the Hou&s;e of Commons from a&s;&s;uming a character which does not belong to it. They
<PB N="61" REF="62">
will endeavour to keep that Hou&s;e, for its exi&s;tence, for its powers, and its privileges, as independent of every other, and as dependent upon them&s;elves, as po&s;&s;ible. This &s;ervitude is to an Hou&s;e of Commons (like the obedience to the Divine law) <Q REND="inline">"perfect freedom."</Q> For if they once quit this natural, rational, and liberal obedience, having de&s;erted the only proper foundation of their power, they mu&s;t &s;eek a &s;upport in an abject and unnatural dependence &s;omewhere el&s;e. When, through the medium of this ju&s;t connexion with their con&s;tituents, the genuine dignity of the Hou&s;e of Commons is re&s;tored, it will begin to think of ca&s;ting from it, with &s;corn, as badges of &s;ervility, all the fal&s;e ornaments of illegal power, with which it has been, for &s;ome time, di&s;graced. It will begin to think of its old office of CONTROUL. It will not &s;uffer, that la&s;t of evils, to predominate in the country; men without popular con|fidence, public opinion, natural connexion, or mutual tru&s;t, inve&s;ted with all the powers of Government.</P>
<P>When they have learned this le&s;&s;on them&s;elves, they will be willing and able to teach the Court, that it is the true intere&s;t of the Prince to have but one Admini&s;tration; and that one compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who recommend them&s;elves to their Sovereign through the opinion of their country, and not by their ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s to a favourite. Such men will &s;erve their Sovereign with affection and fidelity; becau&s;e his choice of them, upon &s;uch principles, is a compliment to their virtue. They will be able to &s;erve him effectually; becau&s;e they will add the weight of the country to the force of the executory power. They will be able to &s;erve their King with dig|nity; becau&s;e they will never abu&s;e his name to the gratification of their private &s;pleen or avarice. This, with allowances for human frailty, may probably be the general character of a Mini&s;try, which thinks it&s;elf ac|countable to the Hou&s;e of Commons; when the Hou&s;e of Commons thinks it&s;elf accountable to its con&s;tituents. If other ideas &s;hould prevail, things mu&s;t remain in their pre&s;ent confu&s;ion; until they are hurried into all the rage of civil violence; or until they &s;ink into the dead repo&s;e of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
