<P>WHEN Addre&s;&s;es of this Sort are made to Per&s;ons of your Royal Highne&s;s's elevated State, it is, I believe u&s;ual, previou&s;ly to &s;upplicate Leave for their Reception&mdash;But here I pre|&s;ume, it would have been as equally needle&s;s for the author, to have implor|ed your royal highne&s;s's name, for pro|tectre&s;s in the Cau&s;e of Virtue, as it would be for the Ma&s;ter of the Mint, to petition in Form your royal Father, for Leave to &s;tamp his Name on our coin to give Sanction to its Currency.</P>
<P>The Inducements, Madam, to throw this Piece, therefore, under your royal highne&s;s's protection, were &s;olely from con&s;idering it as an act of duty, added to the Pride of having the high ho|nour to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>

<L>AS in the airy Regions of Romance,</L>
<L>Th' adventrous Knight &s;ets out with Shield and Lance,</L>
<L>Strait his di&s;intere&s;ted Valour flies</L>
<L>To helple&s;s Dam&s;els, and to Beauty's Cries;</L>
<L>This only Motive ri&s;ing in his Brea&s;t,</L>
<L>The Godlike Plea&mdash;of Innocence di&s;tre&s;s'd.</L>
<L>Thus dares our Author-Errant of To-Night,</L>
<L>In Virtue's Aid romantically fight;</L>
<L>Sacred to Her, the Champion Pen he draws,</L>
<L>Enough rewarded&mdash;to &s;upport her Cau&s;e.</L>
<L>To-Night his hone&s;t Labour means to prove,</L>
<L>A low-born Virtue worth a great Man's Love;</L>
<L>An hone&s;t Pride, where con&s;cious Honour glows;</L>
<L>An artle&s;s Innocence&mdash;whence Truth &s;till flows;</L>
<L>A Sen&s;e proceeding but from Nature's Light,</L>
<L>(For little Knowledge &s;erves us to be right)</L>
<L>A Merit greatly poor, that far out&s;hines</L>
<L>The Glare of Titles, or the Wealth of Mines.</L>
<L>Such &s;tedfa&s;t Hone&s;ty &s;hould find Succe&s;s</L>
<L>O'er the abandon'd Authors of Di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>O'er tho&s;e who glory to betray a Maid,</L>
<L>Who welcome Guilt, and make Deceit a Trade.</L>
<L>Yet &s;ome there are le&s;s liable to blame,</L>
<L>Who only want Reflection to reclaim,</L>
<L>Who bend unthinking to the Syren's Voice,</L>
<L>The Reprobates of Cu&s;tom, not of Choice;</L>
<L>Who deaf to Precept, plead Example &s;till,</L>
<L>And think the Mode indemnifies the Ill.</L>
<L>To &s;uch our Author offers this Addre&s;s,</L>
<L>Not certain, nor de&s;pairing of Succe&s;s;</L>
<L>Among&s;t this Ca&s;t of Men he hopes to find</L>
<L>Some Converts&mdash;for the Honour of Mankind;</L>
<L>On Minds like the&s;e his Morals may prevail,</L>

<P>Why la&s;t Market-day I came home, as 'twere a little tip&s;y, and laid me down i'th' Stable, on a Tru&s;s of Straw, and fell fa&s;t a&s;leep; and there, what &s;hould I dream, but that our Hou&s;e was turn'd into a Windmill.</P>

<P>Merciful, Sirs!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, a Windmill,&mdash;and that Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> Ma&s;ter's <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> Hou&s;e keeper, was the Miller's Man, and we four, to be &s;ure, turn'd into A&s;&s;es&mdash;and&mdash;murrain take her&mdash;nothing would &s;erve her turn, but &s;he would have us to draw in place o'th' Hor&s;es;&mdash;but methought we were plaguy re&s;ty&mdash;for, to be &s;ure, never was the like heard of; and jirk us about &s;he did mo&s;t cruelly.&mdash;</P>

<P>So methought, at a little Di&s;tance from the Mill, was good Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> our Hou&s;e-keeper here, and pretty Mrs. <HI>Pamela,</HI> my late Lady's waiting Wo|man, with each a Bundle under their Arms, as if &s;o be they were going to &s;eek their Fortunes&mdash;And is not all this now plainly made out&mdash;is not the whole Hou&s;e in a Quandary, and a terrible Uproar? Is not the 'Squire, as it were, turn'd to another &s;ort of a Man, and mainly alter'd for the wor&s;e?

<P>What a murrain makes the 'Squire in &s;uch a Flu&s;ter with them tho'?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you mu&s;t know Mrs. <HI>Pamela,</HI> they &s;ay, has been a little too bold, and given Ma&s;ter untoward An&s;wers and you know he's deadly haughty and pa&s;|&s;ionate but, poor Soul, I wonder how it &s;hould chance &s;o, for to be &s;ure I never heard her give any living Soul in the Hou&s;e a wry Word.</P>

<P>I hope, Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> you find every Thing properly and ju&s;tly accounted for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>So ju&s;tly, good Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> that I am under great Concern to find my Ma&s;ter's Warmth of Temper &s;o little con&s;i&s;tent with his Intere&s;t, to di&s;charge a Per&s;on from his Family who has many Years with
<PB N="10" REF="9">
&s;uch Prudence and Ju&s;tice &s;o well acquitted her Tru&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Jerv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Approbation of my Conduct, Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> (next to that of our Ma&s;ter's) is its be&s;t Ju&s;tification.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have more than that, good Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> the Approbation and good Wi&s;hes of the whole Family, which &s;eldom go hand in hand with a Fruga|lity like yours, for the good Opinion of the lower Ser|vants in a Family is rarely obtain'd but by Indulgencies hurtful to the Intere&s;t of its Ma&s;ter&mdash;And I cou'd wi&s;h you'd give me Leave (for the Advantage and Plea|&s;ure of our's) to &s;olicit Mr. <HI>Belvile</HI> for your Continu|ance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Jerv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> there are many prevailing Rea&s;ons to accept with Plea&s;ure your kind offer&mdash;And what I am apt to think may induce his Honour not to reject it, is the Removal of the dear, un|happy, tho' innocent Occa&s;ion of his Re&s;entment to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>The lovely <HI>Pamela</HI> you mean! Oh, Mrs. <HI>Jervis!</HI> there is I fear another Motive which your Di&s;cretion and Regard to my Ma&s;ter's Honour has con|cealed, that renders his Re&s;entment, as you call it, in|excu&s;able to both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs.</HI> Jerv.</SPEAKER>
<P>But his complying with the good Girl's earne&s;t Reque&s;t to be &s;ent home to her Father and Mo|ther, is, I think, a &s;ufficient Proof of his Re&s;olution no longer to entertain &s;uch Thoughts that might (as you but too ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pect) prove hurtful to dear <HI>Pamela</HI>'s Virtue and his own Honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mr.</HI> Long.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true&mdash;and I am heartily re|joiced to find the Temptation will be remov'd from both, for 'twou'd be a hard Task, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> for poor <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;trong as &s;he is in Virtue, to with&s;tand the artful in&s;inuating Snares of a hand&s;ome wealthy Man, like our Ma&s;ter, and I fear a much harder for him to overcome his too warm De&s;ire for &s;o tempting an Object, were they to have con&s;tant Opportunities of &s;eeing each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
