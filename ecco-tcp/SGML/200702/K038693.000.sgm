<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour of &s;ending you the two la&s;t acts which have been pa&s;&s;ed with regard to the troubles in America. The&s;e acts are &s;imilar to all the re&s;t which have been made on the &s;ame &s;ubject. They operate by the &s;ame principle; and they are derived from the very &s;ame policy. I think they complete the number of this &s;ort of &s;tatutes to nine. It affords no matter for very plea&s;ing reflection, to ob&s;erve, that our &s;ubjects dimini&s;h, as our laws encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>If I have the misfortune of differing with &s;ome of my fellow-citizens on this great and arduous &s;ubject, it is no &s;mall con&s;olation to me, that I do not differ from you. With you,
<PB N="4" REF="3">
I am perfectly united. We are heartily agreed in our dete&s;tation of a civil war. We have ever expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t unqualified di&s;appro|bation of all the &s;teps which have led to it, and of all tho&s;e which tend to prolong it. And I have no doubt that we feel exactly the &s;ame emotions of grief and &s;hame on all its mi&s;e|rable con&s;equences; whether they appear, on the one &s;ide or the other, in the &s;hape of vic|tories or defeats; of captures made from the Engli&s;h on the continent, or from the Engli&s;h in the&s;e i&s;lands; of legi&s;lative regulations which &s;ubvert the liberties of our brethren, or which undermine our own.</P>
<P>Of the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;tatutes (that for the letter of marque) I &s;hall &s;ay little: Excep|tionable as it may be, and as I think it is in &s;ome particulars, it &s;eems the natural, perhaps nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of the mea&s;ures we have taken, and the &s;ituation we are in. The other (for a partial &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI>) appears to me of a much deeper malignity. During its progre&s;s through the Hou&s;e of Commons, it has been amended, &s;o as to ex|pre&s;s more di&s;tinctly than at fir&s;t it did, the avowed &s;entiments of tho&s;e who framed it: and the main ground of my exception to it is, becau&s;e it does expre&s;s, and does carry into execution, purpo&s;es which appear to me &s;o contradictory to all the principles, not only of the con&s;titutional policy of Great Britain, but
<PB N="5" REF="4">
even of that &s;pecies of ho&s;tile, ju&s;tice, which no a&s;perity of war wholly extingui&s;hes in the minds of a civilized people.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to have in view two capital objects; the fir&s;t, to enable admini&s;tration to confine, as long as it &s;hall think proper, (within the dura|tion of the act) tho&s;e, whom that act is plea&s;ed to qualify by the name of <HI>Pirates.</HI> Tho&s;e &s;o qualified, I under&s;tand to be, the commanders and mariners of &s;uch privateers and &s;hips of war belonging to the colonies, as in the cour&s;e of this unhappy conte&s;t may fall into the hands of the crown. They are therefore to be detained in pri&s;on, under the criminal de|&s;cription of piracy, to a future trial and igno|minious puni&s;hment, whenever circum&s;tances &s;hall make it convenient to execute vengeance on them, under the colour of that odious and infamous offence.</P>
<P>To this fir&s;t purpo&s;e of the law, I have no &s;mall di&s;like. Becau&s;e the act does not (as all laws, and all equitable tran&s;actions ought to do) fairly de&s;cribe its object. The per&s;ons, who make a naval war upon us, in con&s;equence of the pre&s;ent troubles, may be <HI>rebels</HI>; but to call and treat them as <HI>pirates,</HI> is confounding, hot only the natural di&s;tinction of things, but the order of crimes; which, whether by put|ting them from a higher part of the &s;cale to the lower, or from the lower to the higher, is
<PB N="6" REF="5">
never done without dangerou&s;ly di&s;ordering the whole frame of juri&s;prudence. Though piracy may be, in the eye of the law, a <HI>le&s;s</HI> offence than trea&s;on; yet as both are, in effect, pu|ni&s;hed with the &s;ame death, the &s;ame forfei|ture, and the &s;ame corruption of blood, I never would take from any fellow-creature what|ever, any &s;ort of advantage, which he may de|rive to his &s;afety from the pity of mankind, or to his reputation from their general feelings, by degrading his offence, when I cannot &s;often his puni&s;hment. The general &s;en&s;e of man|kind tells me, that tho&s;e offences, which may po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from mi&s;taken virtue, are not in the cla&s;s of infamous actions. Lord Coke, the oracle of the Engli&s;h law, conforms to that general &s;en&s;e, where he &s;ays, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"tho&s;e things which are of the highe&s;t criminality may be of the lea&s;t di&s;grace."</Q>
The act pre|pares a &s;ort of ma&s;qued proceeding, not ho|nourable to the ju&s;tice of the kingdom, and by no means nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;afety. I cannot enter into it. If lord Balmerino, in the la&s;t rebellion, had driven off the cattle of twenty clans, I &s;hould have thought it a &s;candalous and low juggle, utterly unworthy of the man|line&s;s of an Engli&s;h judicature, to have tried him for felony, as a &s;tealer of cows.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I mu&s;t hone&s;tly tell you, that I could not vote-for, or countenance in any way, a &s;tatute, which &s;tigmatizes with the crime of
<PB N="7" REF="6">
piracy, tho&s;e men, whom an act of parliament had previou&s;ly put out of the protection of the law. When the legi&s;lature of this kingdom had ordered all their &s;hips and goods, for the mere new-created offence of exerci&s;ing trade, to be divided as a &s;poil among the &s;eamen of the navy,&mdash;for the &s;ame legi&s;lature afterwards to treat the nece&s;&s;ary repri&s;al of an unhappy, pro&s;cribed, interdicted people, as the crime of piracy, &s;eems, har&s;h and incongruous. Such a procedure would have appeared (in any other legi&s;lature than ours) a &s;train of the mo&s;t in&s;ult|ing, and mo&s;t unnatural cruelty and inju&s;tice. I a&s;&s;ure you, I do not remember to have heard of any thing like it in any time or country.</P>
<P>The &s;econd profe&s;&s;ed purpo&s;e of the act is to detain in England for trial, tho&s;e who &s;hall commit high trea&s;on in America.</P>
<P>That you may be enabled to enter into the true &s;pirit of the pre&s;ent law, it is nece&s;&s;ary, gentlemen, to appri&s;e you, that there is an act, made &s;o long ago as the reign of Henry the eighth, before the exi&s;tence or thought of any Engli&s;h colonies in America, for the trial in this kingdom of trea&s;ons committed out of the realm. In the year 1769, parliament thought proper to acquaint the crown with their con|&s;truction of that act, in a formal addre&s;s, wherein they intreated his Maje&s;ty, to cau&s;e per&s;ons, charged with high trea&s;on in America, to be brought into this kingdom for trial. By
<PB N="8" REF="7">
this act of Henry the eighth, <HI>&s;o con&s;trued and &s;o applied,</HI> almo&s;t all that is &s;ub&s;tantial and beneficial in a trial by jury is taken away from the &s;ubject in the colonies. This is how|ever &s;aying too little; for to try a man under that act is, in effect, to condemn him unheard, A per&s;on is brought hither in the dungeon of a &s;hip's hold: thence he is vomited into a dun|geon on land; loaded with irons, unfurni&s;hed with money, un&s;upported by friends, three thou&s;and miles from all means of calling upon, or confronting evidence, where no one local circum&s;tance that tends to detect perjury, can po&s;&s;ibly be judged of;&mdash;&s;uch a per&s;on may be executed according to form, but he can never be tried according to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I therefore could by no means reconcile my|&s;elf to the bill I &s;end you; which is expre&s;sly provided to remove all inconveniences from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a mode of trial, which has ever appeared to me mo&s;t unju&s;t and mo&s;t un|con&s;titutional. Far from removing the diffi|culties which impede the execution of &s;o mi&s;|chievous a project, I would heap new difficul|ties upon it, if it were in my power. All the ancient, hone&s;t juridical principles, and in&s;titu|tions of England, are &s;o many clogs to check and retard the headlong cour&s;e of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion. They were invented for this one good purpo&s;e;&mdash;that what was not ju&s;t &s;hould not be convenient. Convinced of this, I would
<PB N="9" REF="8">
leave things as I found them. The old, cool|headed, general law, is as good as any deviation dictated by pre&s;ent heat.</P>
<P>I could &s;ee no fair ju&s;tifiable expedience pleaded to favour this new &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the liberty of the &s;ubject. If the Engli&s;h in the colonies can &s;upport the independency to which they have been unfortunately driven, I &s;uppo&s;e nobody has &s;uch a fanatical zeal for the criminal ju&s;tice of Henry the eighth, that he will contend for executions which mu&s;t be retaliated tenfold on his own friends; or who has conceived &s;o &s;trange an idea of Engli&s;h dignity, as to think the defeats in America compen&s;ated by the triumphs at Tyburn. If, on the contrary, the colonies are reduced to the obedience of the crown, there mu&s;t be, under that authority, tribunals in the country it&s;elf, fully competent to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice on all offenders. But if there are not, and that we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e a thing &s;o humiliating to our government, as that all this va&s;t continent &s;hould unanimou&s;ly concur in thinking, that no ill fortune can convert re&s;i&s;tance to the royal authority into a criminal act, we may call the effect of our victory peace, or obedi|ence, or what we will; but the war is not ended: The ho&s;tile mind continues in full vigour; and it continues under a wor&s;e form. If your peace be nothing more than a &s;ullen pau&s;e from arms; if their quiet be nothing
<PB N="10" REF="9">
but the meditation of revenge, where &s;mitten pride, &s;marting from its wounds, fe&s;ters into new rancour, neither the act of Henry the eighth, nor its handmaid of this reign, will an&s;wer any wi&s;e end of policy or ju&s;tice. For if the bloody fields, which they &s;aw and felt, are not &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue the rea&s;on of Ame|ricans (to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ive phra&s;e of a great lord in office) it is not the judicial &s;laughter, which is made in another hemi&s;phere again&s;t their univer&s;al &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, that will ever reconcile them to the Briti&s;h government.</P>
<P>I take it for granted, gentlemen, that we &s;ympathize in a proper horror of all puni&s;h|ment further than as it &s;erves for an example. To whom then does the example of an execu|tion in England for this American rebellion apply? Remember, you are told every day, that the pre&s;ent is a conte&s;t between the two countries; and that we in England are at war for <HI>our own</HI> dignity again&s;t our rebellious chil|dren. Is this true? If it be, it is &s;urely among &s;uch rebellious children that examples for di&s;|obedience &s;hould be made. For who ever thought of in&s;tructing parents in their duty by an example from the puni&s;hment of a di&s;o|bedient &s;on? As well might the execution of a fugitive negro in the plantations, be con&s;idered as a le&s;&s;on to teach ma&s;ters humanity to their &s;laves. Such executions may indeed &s;atiate our revenge; they may
<PB N="11" REF="10">
harden our hearts: and puff us up with pride and arrogance. Alas! this is not in|&s;truction.</P>
<P>If anything can be drawn from &s;uch ex|amples by a parity of the ca&s;e, it is to &s;hew, how deep their crime, and how heavy their puni&s;hment will be, who &s;hall at any time dare to re&s;i&s;t a di&s;tant power actually di&s;|po&s;ing of their property, without their voice or con&s;ent to the di&s;po&s;ition; and overturning their franchi&s;es without charge or hearing. God forbid, that England &s;hould ever read this le&s;&s;on written in the blood of <HI>any</HI> of her off-&s;pring!</P>
<P>War is at pre&s;ent carried on, between the king's natural and foreign troops, on one &s;ide, and the Engli&s;h in America, on the other, upon the u&s;ual footing of other wars; and accordingly an exchange of pri&s;oners has been regularly made from the beginning. If, not|with&s;tanding this hitherto equal procedure, upon &s;ome pro&s;pect of ending the war with &s;ucce&s;s, (which however may be delu&s;ive) ad|mini&s;tration prepares to act again&s;t tho&s;e as <HI>traitors</HI> who remain in their hands at the end of the troubles, in my opinion we &s;hall exhibit to the world as indecent a piece of inju&s;tice as ever civil fury has produced. If the pri&s;oners who have been exchanged have not by that exchange been <HI>virtually pardoned,</HI> the cartel
<PB N="12" REF="11">
(whether avowed or under&s;tood) is a cruel fraud: for you have received the life of a man; and you ought to return a life for it, or there is no parity or fairne&s;s in the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, we admit, that they, who are actually exchanged are pardoned, but contend that we may ju&s;tly re&s;erve for ven|geance, tho&s;e who remain unexchanged; then this unplea&s;ant and unhand&s;ome con&s;equence will follow; that you judge of the delinquency of men merely by the time of their guilt, and not by the heinou&s;ne&s;s of it; and you make fortune and accidents, and not the moral qua|lities of human action, the rule of your ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;trange incongruities mu&s;t ever per|plex tho&s;e, who confound the unhappine&s;s of civil di&s;&s;ention, with the crime of trea&s;on, Whenever a rebellion really and truly exi&s;ts, (which is as ea&s;ily known in fact, as it is diffi|cult to define in words) government has not entered into &s;uch military conventions; but has ever declined all intermediate treaty, which &s;hould put rebels in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the law of nations with regard to war. Com|manders would receive no benefits at their hands, becau&s;e they could make no return for them. Who has ever heard of capitulation, and parole of honour, and exchange of pri|&s;oners, in the late rebellions in this kingdom? The an&s;wer to all demands of that &s;ort was,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes"><PB N="13" REF="12">"we can engage for nothing; you are at the king's plea&s;ure."</Q>
We ought to remember, that if our pre&s;ent enemies be, in reality and truth, rebels, the king's generals have no right to relea&s;e them upon any conditions what&s;o|ever; and they are them&s;elves an&s;werable to the law, and as much in want of a pardon for doing &s;o, as the rebels whom they relea&s;e.</P>
<P>Lawyers, I know, cannot make the di&s;tinc|tion, for which I contend; becau&s;e they have their &s;trict rule to go by. But legi&s;lators ought to do what lawyers cannot; for they have no other rules to bind them, but the great prin|ciples of rea&s;on and equity, and the general &s;en&s;e of mankind. The&s;e they are bound to obey and follow; and rather to enlarge and enlighten law by the liberality of legi&s;lative rea&s;on, than to fetter and bind their higher capacity by the narrow con&s;tructions of &s;ubor|dinate artificial ju&s;tice. If we had adverted to this, we never could con&s;ider the convul&s;ions of a great empire, not di&s;turbed by a little di&s;|&s;eminated faction, but divided by whole com|muities and provinces, and entire legal repre|&s;entatives of a people, as fit matter of di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion under a commi&s;&s;ion of oyer and terminer. It is as oppo&s;ite to rea&s;on and prudence, as it is to humanity and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>This act, proceeding on the&s;e principles, that is, preparing to end the pre&s;ent troubles
<PB N="14" REF="13">
by a trial of one &s;ort of ho&s;tility, under the name of piracy, and of another by the name of trea&s;on, and executing the act of Henry the eighth according to a new and uncon&s;titutio|nal interpretation, I have thought evil and dangerous, even though the in&s;truments of effecting &s;uch purpo&s;es had been merely of a neutral quality.</P>
<P>But it really appears to me, that the means which this act employs are, at lea&s;t, as excep|tionable as the end. Permit me to open my|&s;elf a little upon this &s;ubject, becau&s;e it is of importance to me, when I am obliged to &s;ub|mit to the power without acquie&s;cing in the rea&s;on of an act of legi&s;lature, that I &s;hould ju&s;tify my di&s;&s;ent, by &s;uch arguments as may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have weight with a &s;ober man.</P>
<P>The main operative regulation of the act is to &s;u&s;pend the common law, and the &s;tatute <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> (the &s;ole &s;ecurities either for liberty or ju&s;tice) with regard to all tho&s;e who have been out of the realm or on the high &s;eas, within a given time. The re&s;t of the people, as I under&s;tand, are to continue as they &s;tood before.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, gentlemen, that this appears to me, as bad in the principle, and far wor&s;e in its con&s;equence, than an univer&s;al &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> act; and the limiting
<PB N="15" REF="14">
qualification, in&s;tead of taking out the &s;ting, does in my humble opinion &s;harpen and enve|nom it to a greater degree. Liberty, if I un|der&s;tand it at all, is a <HI>general</HI> principle, and the clear right of all the &s;ubjects within the realm, or of none. Partial freedom &s;eems to me a mo&s;t invidious mode of &s;lavery. But, unfortu|nately, it is the kind of &s;lavery the mo&s;t ea&s;ily admitted in times of civil di&s;cord. For parties are but too apt to forget their own future &s;afety in their de&s;ire of &s;acrificing their ene|mies. People without much difficulty admit the entrance of that inju&s;tice of which they are not to be the immediate victims. In times of high proceeding, it is never the faction of the predominant power that is in danger; for no tyranny cha&s;ti&s;es its own in&s;truments. It is the obnoxious and the &s;u&s;pected who want the protection of law; and there is nothing to bridle the partial violence of &s;tate factions, but this great, &s;teady, uniform principle;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that whenever an act is made for a ce&s;&s;ation of law and ju&s;tice, the whole people &s;hould be univer&s;ally &s;ubjected to the &s;ame &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of their franchi&s;es."</Q>
The alarm of &s;uch a proceeding would then be univer&s;al. It would operate as a &s;ort of <HI>call of the nation.</HI> It would become every man's immediate and in&s;tant concern to be made very &s;en&s;ible of <HI>the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of this total eclip&s;e of liberty. They would more carefully advert to every renewal, and more powerfully re&s;i&s;t it. The&s;e great determined mea&s;ures are not commonly
<PB N="16" REF="15">
&s;o dangerous to freedom. They are marked with too &s;trong lines to &s;lide into u&s;e. No plea or pretence of mere <HI>inconvenience or evil example</HI> (which mu&s;t in their nature be daily and ordi|nary incidents) can be admitted as a rea&s;on for &s;uch mighty operations. But the true danger is, when liberty is nibbled away, for expedi|ents, and by parts. The <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> act &s;uppo&s;es (contrary to the genius of mo&s;t other laws) that the lawful magi&s;trate may &s;ee par|ticular men with a malignant eye; and it pro|vides for that identical ca&s;e. But when men, <HI>in particular de&s;criptions, marked out by the magi&s;trate him&s;elf,</HI> are delivered over by par|liament to this po&s;&s;ible malignity, it is not the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> that is occa&s;ionally &s;u&s;pended, but its &s;pirit that is mi&s;taken, and its principle that is &s;ubverted. Indeed nothing is &s;ecurity to any individual but the common intere&s;t of all.</P>
<P>This act, therefore, has this di&s;tingui&s;hed evil in it, that it is the fir&s;t <HI>partial</HI> &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> which has been made. The precedent, which is always of very great impor|tance, is now e&s;tabli&s;hed. For the fir&s;t time a di&s;tinction is made among the people within this realm. Before this act, every man put|ting his foot on Engli&s;h ground, every &s;tran|ger owing only a local and temporary allegi|ance, even a negro &s;lave, who had been &s;old in the colonies and under an act of parliament,
<PB N="17" REF="16">
became as free as every other man who breathed the &s;ame air with him. Now a line is drawn, which may be advanced further and further at plea&s;ure, on the &s;ame argument of mere expedience, on which it was fir&s;t de|&s;cribed. There is no equality among us; we are not fellow-citizens, if the mariner who lands on the quay does not re&s;t on as firm legal ground, as the merchant who &s;its in his compting-hou&s;e. Other laws may injure the community, this tends to di&s;&s;olve it. It de&s;troys <HI>equality,</HI> which is the e&s;&s;ence of community. As things now &s;tand, every man in the We&s;t Indies, every one inhabitant of three unoffend|ing provinces on the continent, every per&s;on coming from the Ea&s;t Indies, every gentleman who has travelled for his health or education, every mariner who has navigated the &s;eas, is, for no other offence, under a temporary pro|&s;cription. Let any of the&s;e facts (now become pre&s;umptions of guilt) be proved again&s;t him, and the bare &s;u&s;picion of the crown puts him out of the law. It is even by no means clear to me, whether the negative proof does not lie upon the per&s;on apprehended on &s;u&s;picion, to the &s;ubver&s;ion of all ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I have not debated again&s;t this bill in its progre&s;s through the Hou&s;e; becau&s;e it would have been vain to oppo&s;e, and impo&s;&s;ible to correct it. It is &s;ome time &s;ince I have been clearly convinced, that in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, all oppo&s;ition to any mea&s;ures propo&s;ed
<PB N="18" REF="17">
by mini&s;ters, where the name of America ap|pears, is vain and frivolous. You may be &s;ure, that I do not &s;peak of my oppo&s;ition, which in all circum&s;tances mu&s;t be &s;o; but that of men of the greate&s;t wi&s;dom and authority in the nation. Every thing propo&s;ed <HI>again&s;t</HI> America is &s;uppo&s;ed of cour&s;e to be <HI>in favour</HI> of Great Britain. Good and ill &s;ucce&s;s are equally admitted as rea&s;ons for per&s;evering in the pre&s;ent methods. Several very prudent, and very well intentioned per&s;ons were of opi|nion, that during the prevalence of &s;uch di&s;po|&s;itions, all &s;truggle tended rather to inflame than to abate the di&s;temper of the public coun|&s;els. Finding &s;uch re&s;i&s;tance to be con&s;idered as factious by mo&s;t within doors, and by very many without, I could not con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;up|port what is again&s;t my opinion, nor prudently contend with what I know is irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>Pre&s;erving my principles un&s;haken, I re|&s;erve my activity for rational endeavours; and I hope my pa&s;t conduct has given &s;ufficient evi|dence, that if I am a &s;ingle day from my place, it is not owing to indolence or love of di&s;&s;ipa|tion. The &s;lighte&s;t hope of doing good is &s;uf|ficient to recal me to a &s;tation which I quit|ted with regret. In declining my u&s;ual &s;trict attendance, I do not in the lea&s;t condemn the &s;pirit of tho&s;e gentlemen, who, with a ju&s;t confidence in their abilities, (in which I claim a &s;ort of &s;hare from my love and admiration of them) were of opinion that their exertions in this de&s;perate ca&s;e might be of &s;ome &s;ervice.

They thought, that by contracting the &s;phere of its application, they might le&s;&s;en the ma|lignity of an evil principle. Perhaps they were in the right.

<P>I mu&s;t add, in further explanation of my conduct, that, far from &s;oftening the features of &s;uch a principle, and thereby removing any part of the popular odium or natural terrors attending it, I &s;hould be &s;orry, that any thing framed in contradiction to the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution did not in&s;tantly produce in fact, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of the evils, with which it was pregnant in its nature.

<P>The act of which I have &s;aid &s;o much is among the fruits of the American war; a war, in my humble opinion, productive of many mi&s;|chiefs of a kind, which di&s;tingui&s;h it from all others. Not only our policy is deranged, and our empire di&s;tracted, but our laws and our legi&s;lative &s;pirit are in danger of being totally perverted by it. We have made war on our Colonies, not by arms only, but by laws. As ho&s;tility and law are not very concordant ideas, every &s;tep we have taken in this bu|&s;ine&s;s, has been made by trampling on &s;ome maxim of ju&s;tice, or &s;ome capital principle of wi&s;e government. What precedents were e&s;|tabli&s;hed, and what principles overturned, (I will not &s;ay of Engli&s;h privilege, but of ge|neral ju&s;tice), in the Bo&s;ton Port, the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets Charter, the Military Bill, and all that long array of ho&s;tile acts of parliament, by which the war with America has been begun and &s;upported? Had the principles of any of the&s;e acts been fir&s;t planted on Engli&s;h ground they would probably have expired as &s;oon as they touched it. But by being re|moved from our per&s;ons, they have rooted in our laws; and the late&s;t po&s;terity will ta&s;te the fruits of them.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">Nor is it the wor&s;t effect of this unnatural contention, that our <HI>laws</HI> are corrupted. Whil&s;t <HI>manners</HI> remain entire, they will correct the vices of law, and &s;often it at length to their own temper. But we have to lament, that in mo&s;t of the late proceedings we &s;ee very few traces of that genero&s;ity, humanity, and dig|nity of mind, which formerly characterized this nation. War &s;u&s;pends the rules of moral obligation; and what is long &s;u&s;pended is in danger of being totally abrogated. Civil wars &s;trike deepe&s;t of all into the manners of a people. They vitiate their politicks; they corrupt their morals; they pervert even the natural ta&s;te and reli&s;h of equity and ju&s;tice. By teaching us to con&s;ider our fellow-citizens in an ho&s;tile light, the whole body of our nation becomes gradually le&s;s dear to us. The very names of affection and kindred, which were the bond of charity whil&s;t we agreed, become new incentives to hatred and rage, when the communion of our coun|try is di&s;&s;olved. We may flatter our&s;elves that we &s;hall not fall into this misfortune. But we have no charter of exemption, that I know of, from the ordinary frailties of our nature.</P>
<P>What but that blindne&s;s of heart which ari&s;es from the phren&s;y of civil contention, could have made any per&s;ons conceive the

pre&s;ent &s;ituation of the Briti&s;h affairs as an object of triumph to them&s;elves, or of congra|tulation to their &s;overeign?

We behold (and it &s;eems &s;ome people rejoice in beholding) our native land, which u&s;ed to &s;it the envied arbiter of all her neighbours, reduced to a &s;ervile dependence on their mercy; acquie&s;cing in a&s;&s;urances of friend&s;hip which &s;he does not tru&s;t; com|plaining of ho&s;tilities which &s;he dares not re|&s;ent; deficient to her allies; lofty to her &s;ub|jects; and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to her enemies; whil&s;t the liberal government of this free nation is &s;upported by the hireling &s;word of German boors and va&s;&s;als; and three millions of the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain are &s;eeking for pro|tection to Engli&s;h privileges in the arms of France!</P>

me for my declining to participate in this joy; and my rejecting all &s;hare what&s;oever in &s;uch a triumph. I am too old, too &s;tiff in my in|veterate partialities, to be ready at all the fa&s;hionable evolutions of opinion. I &s;carcely know how to adapt my mind to the feelings with which the Court Gazettes mean to im|pre&s;s the people. It is not in&s;tantly that I can be brought to rejoice, when I hear of the &s;laughter and captivity of long li&s;ts of tho&s;e names which have been familiar to my ears from my infancy; and to rejoice that they have fallen under the &s;word of &s;trangers, who&s;e barbarous appellations I &s;carcely know how to pronounce. The glory acquired at the <HI>White Plains</HI> by <HI>Colonel Raille,</HI> has no charms for me; and I fairly acknowledge, that I have not yet learned to delight in finding <HI>Fort Kniphau&s;en</HI> in the heart of the Briti&s;h do|minions.</P>
<P>It might be &s;ome con&s;olation for the lo&s;s of our old regards, if our rea&s;on were enlightened in proportion as our hone&s;t prejudices are re|moved. Wanting feelings for the honour of our country, we might then in cold blood be brought to think a little of our intere&s;ts as in|dividual citizens, and our private con&s;cience as moral agents.</P>
<P>Indeed our affairs are in a bad condition. I do a&s;&s;ure tho&s;e Gentlemen who have prayed
<PB N="24" REF="23">
for war, and obtained the ble&s;&s;ing they have &s;ought, that they are at this in&s;tant in very great &s;traits. The abu&s;ed wealth of this coun|try continues a little longer to feed its di&s;tem|per. As yet they, and their German allies of twenty hireling &s;tates, have contended only with the unprepared &s;trength of our own in|fant colonies. But America is not &s;ubdued. Not one unattacked village, which was ori|ginally adver&s;e, throughout that va&s;t continent, has yet &s;ubmitted from love or terror. You have the ground you encamp on; and you have no more. The cantonments of your troops and your dominions are exactly of the &s;ame extent. You &s;pread deva&s;tation, but you do not enlarge the &s;phere of authority.</P>
<P>The events of this war are of &s;o much greater magnitude than tho&s;e who either wi&s;hed or feared it, ever looked for, that this alone ought to fill every con&s;iderate mind with anxiety and diffidence. Wi&s;e men often tremble at the very things which fill the thoughtle&s;s with &s;ecurity. For many rea&s;ons I do not choo&s;e to expo&s;e to public view, all the particulars of the &s;tate in which you &s;tood with regard to foreign powers, during the whole cour&s;e of the la&s;t year. Whether you are yet wholly out of danger from tho&s;e powers, is more than I know, or than your rulers can divine. But even if I were certain of my &s;afety, I could not ea&s;ily forgive tho&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="24">
who had brought me into the mo&s;t dreadful perils, becau&s;e by accidents, unfore&s;een by them or me, I have e&s;caped.</P>
<P>Believe me, gentlemen, the way &s;till before you is intricate, dark, and full of perplexed and treacherous mazes. Tho&s;e who think they have the clue, may lead us out of this labyrinth. We may tru&s;t them as amply as we think proper. But as they have mo&s;t certainly a call for all the rea&s;on which their &s;tock can furni&s;h, why &s;hould we think it proper to di&s;turb its operation by inflaming their pa&s;&s;ions? I may be unable to lend an helping hand to tho&s;e who direct the &s;tate; but I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to make my&s;elf one of a noi&s;y multitude to hollow and hearten them into doubtful and dangerous cour&s;es. A con&s;cientious man would be cautious how he dealt in blood. He would feel &s;ome apprehen&s;ion at being called to a tremendous account for engaging in &s;o deep a play, without any &s;ort of knowledge of the game. It is no excu&s;e for pre&s;umptuous ignorance, that it is directed by in&s;olent pa&s;|&s;ion. The poore&s;t being that crawls on earth, contending to &s;ave it&s;elf from inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, is an object re&s;pectable in the eyes of God and man. But I cannot conceive any exi&s;tence under heaven, (which, in the depths of its wi&s;dom, tolerates all &s;orts of things) that is more truly odious and di&s;|gu&s;ting, than an impotent helple&s;s creature,
<PB N="26" REF="25">
without civil wi&s;dom or military &s;kill, with|out a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of any other qualifica|tion for power but his &s;ervility to it, bloated with pride and arrogance, calling for battles which he is not to fight, contending for a vi|olent dominion which he can never exerci&s;e, and &s;atisfied to be him&s;elf mean and mi&s;erable, in order to render others contemptible and wretched.</P>
<P>If you and I find our talents not of the great and ruling kind, our conduct at lea&s;t is con|formable to our faculties. No man's life pays the forfeit of our ra&s;hne&s;s. No de&s;olate widow weeps tears of blood over our ignorance. Scru|pulous and &s;ober in our well-grounded di&s;tru&s;t of our&s;elves, we would keep in the port of peace and &s;ecurity: and perhaps in recommending to others &s;omething of the &s;ame diffidence, we &s;hew our&s;elves more charitable to their wel|fare, than injurious to their abilities.</P>
<P>There are many circum&s;tances in the pre&s;ent zeal for civil war, which &s;eem to di&s;cover but little of real magnanimity. The addre&s;&s;ers offer their own per&s;ons; and they are &s;atisfied with hiring Germans. They promi&s;e their private fortunes; and they mortgage their country. They have all the merit of volunteers, without ri&s;que of per&s;on or charge of contribution; and when the unfeeling arm of a foreign &s;oldiery pours out their kindred blood like water, they exult and triumph, as if they them&s;elves had
<PB N="27" REF="26">
performed &s;ome notable exploit. I am really a&s;hamed of the fa&s;hionable language which has been held for &s;ome time pa&s;t; which, to &s;ay the be&s;t of it, is full of levity. You know, that I allude to the general cry again&s;t the cowardice of the Americans, as if we de&s;pi&s;ed them for not making the King's &s;oldiery pur|cha&s;e the advantages they have obtained, at a dearer rate. It is not, Gentlemen, it is not to re&s;pect the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence, nor to provide any decent retreat in the mutability of human affairs. It leaves no medium be|tween in&s;olent victory and infamous defeat. It tends to alienate our minds further and further from our natural regards, and to make an eternal rent and &s;chi&s;m in the Briti&s;h nation. Tho&s;e who do not wi&s;h for &s;uch a &s;eparation, would not di&s;&s;olve that cement of reciprocal e&s;teem and regard, which can alone bind to|gether the parts of this great fabrick. It ought to be our wi&s;h, as it is our duty, not only to forbear this &s;tyle of outrage our&s;elves, but to make every one as &s;en&s;ible as we can of the impropriety and unworthine&s;s of the tempers which gave ri&s;e to it, and which de&s;igning men are labouring with &s;uch malignant indu&s;|try to diffu&s;e among&s;t us. It is our bu&s;ine&s;s to counteract them, if po&s;&s;ible; if po&s;&s;ible to awake our natural regards; and to revive the old partiality to the Engli&s;h name. Without &s;omething of this kind I do not &s;ee how it is ever practicable really to reconcile with tho&s;e,
<PB N="28" REF="27">
who&s;e affections, after all, mu&s;t be the &s;ure&s;t hold of our government; and which are a thou|&s;and times more worth to us, than the merce|nary zeal of all the circles of Germany.</P>
<P>I can well conceive a country completely over-run, and mi&s;erably wa&s;ted, without ap|proaching in the lea&s;t to &s;ettlement. In my apprehen&s;ion as long as Engli&s;h government is attempted to be &s;upported over Engli&s;hmen by the &s;word alone, things will thus continue. I anticipate in my mind the moment of the final triumph of foreign military force. When that hour arrives, (for it may arrive) then it is, that all this ma&s;s of weakne&s;s and violence will ap|pear in its full light. If we &s;hould be expelled from America, the delu&s;ion of the partizans of military government might &s;till continue. They might &s;till feed their imaginations with the po&s;|&s;ible good con&s;equences which might have at|tended &s;ucce&s;s. Nobody could prove the con|trary by facts. But in ca&s;e the &s;word &s;hould do all that the &s;word can do, the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms and the defeat of their policy, will be one and the &s;ame thing. You will never &s;ee any revenue from America. Some increa&s;e of the means of corruption, without any ea&s;e of the public burthens, is the very be&s;t that can happen. Is it for this that we are at war; and in &s;uch a war?</P>
<P>As to the difficulties of laying once more the foundations of that government, which, for
<PB N="29" REF="28">
the &s;ake of conquering what was our own, has been voluntarily and wantonly pulled down by a court faction here, I tremble to look at them. Has any of the&s;e Gentlemen, who are &s;o eager to govern all mankind, &s;hewed him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the fir&s;t qualification towards government, &s;ome knowledge of the object, and of the diffi|culties which occur in the ta&s;k they have under|taken?</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, that on the mo&s;t pro&s;perous i&s;&s;ue of your arms, you will not be where you &s;tood, when you called in war to &s;upply the defects of your political e&s;tabli&s;hment. Nor would any di&s;order or di&s;obedience to govern|ment which could ari&s;e from the mo&s;t abject conce&s;&s;ion on our part, ever equal tho&s;e which will be felt, after the mo&s;t triumphant vio|lence. You have got all the intermediate evils of war into the bargain.</P>
<P>I think I know America. If I do not, my ignorance is incurable, for I have &s;pared no pains to under&s;tand it; and I do mo&s;t &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure tho&s;e of my Con&s;tituents who put any &s;ort of confidence in my indu&s;try and integri|ty, that every thing that has been done there has ari&s;en from a total mi&s;conception of the object: that our means of originally holding America, that our means of reconciling with it after quarrel, of recovering it after &s;eparation, of keeping it after victory, did depend, and
<PB N="30" REF="29">
mu&s;t depend, in their &s;everal &s;tages and pe|riods, upon a total renunciation of that un|conditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which has taken &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the minds of violent men. The whole of tho&s;e maxims, upon which we have made and continued this war, mu&s;t be aban|doned. Nothing indeed (for I would not de|ceive you) can place us in our former &s;ituation. That hope mu&s;t be laid a&s;ide. But there is a difference between bad and the wor&s;t of all. Terms relative to the cau&s;e of the war ought to be offered by the authority of parliament. An arrangement at home promi&s;ing &s;ome &s;e|curity for them ought to be made. By doing this, without the lea&s;t impairing of our &s;trength, we add to the credit of our modera|tion, which in it&s;elf, is always &s;trength more or le&s;s.</P>
<P>I know many have been taught to think, that moderation, in a ca&s;e like this, is a &s;ort of trea&s;on: and that all arguments for it are &s;ufficiently an&s;wered by railing at rebels and rebellion, and by charging all the pre&s;ent or future mi&s;eries which we may &s;uffer, on the re&s;i&s;tance of our brethren. But I would wi&s;h them, in this grave matter, and if peace is not wholly removed from their hearts, to con|&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, fir&s;t,&mdash;that to criminate and re|criminate never yet was the road to reconci|liation, in any difference among&s;t men. In the next place, it would be right to reflect,
<PB N="31" REF="30">
that the American Engli&s;h (whom they may abu&s;e, if they think it honourable to revile the ab&s;ent) can, as things now &s;tand, neither be provoked at our railing, or bettered by our in&s;truction. All communication is cut off be|tween us. But this we know with certainty; that though we cannot reclaim them, we may reform our&s;elves. If mea&s;ures of peace are nece&s;&s;ary, they mu&s;t begin &s;omewhere; and a conciliatory temper mu&s;t precede and prepare every plan of reconciliation. Nor do I con|ceive that we &s;uffer any thing by thus regu|lating our own minds. We are not di&s;armed by being di&s;encumbered of our pa&s;&s;ions. De|claiming on Rebellion never added a bayonet, or a charge of powder, to your military force; but I am afraid that it has been the means of taking up many a mu&s;ket again&s;t you.</P>
<P>This outrageous language, which has been encouraged and kept alive by every art, has al|ready done incredible mi&s;chief. For a long time, even amid&s;t the de&s;olations of war, and the in&s;ults of ho&s;tile laws daily accumulated on one another, the American leaders &s;eem to have had the greate&s;t difficulty in bringing up their people to a declaration of total indepen|dence. But the Court Gazette accompli&s;hed what the abettors of independence had attemp|ted in vain. When that di&s;ingenuous compila|tion, and &s;trange medley of railing and flattery, was adduced, as a proof of the united &s;enti|ments
<PB N="32" REF="31">
of the people of Great Britain, there was a great change throughout all America. The tide of popular affection, which had &s;till &s;et towards the parent country, began immediate|ly to turn; and to flow with great rapidity in a contrary cour&s;e. Far from concealing the&s;e wild declarations of enmity, the author of the celebrated pamphlet which prepared the minds of the people for independence, in&s;i&s;ts largely on the multitude and the &s;pirit of the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es; and he draws an argument from them, which (if the fact were as he &s;uppo&s;es) mu&s;t be irre&s;i&s;tible. For I never knew a writer on the theory of government, &s;o partial to au|thority, as not to allow, that the <HI>ho&s;tile mind</HI> of the rulers to their people, did fully ju&s;tify a change of government. Nor can any rea&s;on whatever be given, why one people &s;hould vo|luntarily yield any degree of pre-eminence to another, but on a &s;uppo&s;ition of great affection and benevolence towards them. Unfortu|nately your rulers, tru&s;ting to other things, took no notice of this great principle of con|nexion. From the beginning of this affair, they have done all they could to alienate your minds from your own kindred; and if they could excite hatred enough in one of the par|ties towards the other, they &s;eemed to be of opinion that they had gone half way towards reconciling the quarrel.</P>
<P>I know it is &s;aid, that your kindne&s;s is only alienated on account of their re&s;i&s;tance; and

therefore if the colonies &s;urrender at di&s;cretion all &s;ort of regard, and even much indulgence is meant towards them in future.

Will they tell us what they call indulgences? Do they not at this in|&s;tant call the pre&s;ent war and all its horrors, a lenient and merciful proceeding?</P>
<P>No conqueror, that I ever heard of, has <HI>profe&s;&s;ed</HI> to make a cruel, har&s;h, and in&s;olent u&s;e of his conque&s;t. No! The man of the mo&s;t declared pride, &s;carcely dares to tru&s;t his own heart, with this dreadful &s;ecret of ambi|tion. But it will appear in its time; and no man who profe&s;&s;es to reduce another to the in|&s;olent mercy of a foreign arm, ever had any &s;ort of good-will towards him. The profe&s;|&s;ion of kindne&s;s, with that &s;word in his hand, and that demand of &s;urrender, is one of the mo&s;t provoking acts of his ho&s;tility. I &s;hall be told, that all this is lenient, as again&s;t re|bellious adver&s;aries. But are the leaders of their faction more lenient to tho&s;e who &s;ubmit! Lord Howe and General Howe have powers under an Act of Parliament, to re&s;tore to the King's peace and to free trade any men, or di&s;trict, which &s;hall &s;ubmit. Is this done? We have been over and over informed by the

authori&s;ed Gazette, that the city of New York and the countries of Staten and Long I&s;land have &s;ubmitted voluntarily and cheerfully, and that many in the&s;e places are full even of zeal to the cau&s;e of Admini&s;tration. Were they in&s;tantly re&s;tored to trade? Are they yet re&s;tored to it? Is not the benig|nity of two commi&s;&s;ioners, naturally mo&s;t humane and generous men, &s;ome way fet|tered by in&s;tructions, equally again&s;t their di&s;po&s;itions and the &s;pirit of parliamentary faith, when Mr. Tryon, vaunting of the fidelity of the City in which he is Governor, is obliged to apply to mini&s;try for leave to pro|tect the King's loyal &s;ubjects, and to grant to them (not the di&s;puted rights and privileges of freedom) but the common rights of men, by the name of <HI>Graces</HI>? Why do not the com|mi&s;&s;ioners re&s;tore them on the &s;pot? Were they not named as commi&s;&s;ioners for that expre&s;s purpo&s;e? But we &s;ee well enough to what the whole leads.

<P>Tolerated in their pa&s;&s;ions, let them learn not to per&s;ecute the moderation of their fellow-citizens. If all the world joined them in a full cry again&s;t rebellion, and were as hotly inflamed again&s;t the whole theory and enjoy|ment of freedom, as tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t factious for &s;ervitude, it could not in my opi|nion an&s;wer any one end what&s;oever in this conte&s;t. The leaders of this war could not hire (to gratify their friends) one German more, than they do; or in&s;pire him with le&s;s feeling for the per&s;ons, or le&s;s value for the privileges of their revolted brethren. If we all adopted their &s;entiments to a man, their allies the &s;avage Indians, could not be more ferocious than they are: They could not murder one more helple&s;s woman or child, or with more exqui&s;ite refinements of cruelty torment to death one more of their Engli&s;h fle&s;h and blood, than they do already. The public money is given to purcha&s;e this alli|ance;&mdash;and they have their bargain.</P>
<P>They are continually boa&s;ting of unanimity, or calling for it. But before this unanimity
<PB N="37" REF="36">
can be matter either of wi&s;h or congratulation, we ought to be pretty &s;ure, that we are engaged in a rational pur&s;uit. Phren&s;y does not be|come a &s;lighter di&s;temper on account of the number of tho&s;e who may be infected with it. Delu&s;ion and weakne&s;s produce not one mi&s;|chief the le&s;s, becau&s;e they are univer&s;al. I declare, that I cannot di&s;cern the lea&s;t advan|tage, which could accrue to us, if we were able to per&s;uade our Colonies that they had not a &s;ingle friend in Great Britain. On the contrary, if the affections and opinions of mankind be not exploded as principles of con|nexion, I conceive it would be happy for us, if they were taught to believe, that there was even a formed American party in England, to whom they could always look for &s;upport! Happy would it be for us, if in all tempers they might turn their eyes to the parent &s;tate; &s;o that their very turbulence and &s;edition &s;hould find vent in no other place than this. I believe there is not a man (except tho&s;e who prefer the intere&s;t of &s;ome paltry faction to the very being of their country) who would not wi&s;h that the Americans &s;hould from time to time carry many points, and even &s;ome of them not quite rea&s;onable, by the aid of any denomination of men here, rather than they &s;hould be driven to &s;eek for protection again&s;t the fury of foreign mercenaries, and the wa&s;te of &s;avages, in the arms of France.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37">When any community is &s;ubordinately con|nected with another, the great danger of the connexion is the extreme pride and &s;elf-com|placency of the &s;uperior, which in all matters of controver&s;y will probably decide in its own favour. It is a powerful corrective to &s;uch a very rational cau&s;e of fear, if the inferior body can be made to believe, that the party inclina|tion or political views of &s;everal in the princi|pal &s;tate, will induce them in &s;ome degree to counteract this blind and tyrannic partiality. There is no danger that any one acquiring con|&s;ideration or power in the pre&s;iding &s;tate &s;hould carry this leaning to the inferior too far. The fault of human nature is not of that &s;ort. Power in whatever hands is rarely guilty of too &s;trict limitations on it&s;elf. But one great advantage to the &s;upport of authority attends &s;uch an ami|cable and protecting connexion, that tho&s;e who have conferred favours obtain influence; and from the fore&s;ight of future events can per&s;uade men who have received obligations &s;ometimes to return them. Thus by the mediation of tho&s;e healing principles, (call them good or evil) trouble&s;ome di&s;cu&s;&s;ions are brought to &s;ome &s;ort of adju&s;tment; and every hot con|trover&s;y is not a civil war.</P>
<P>But, if the Colonies (to bring the general matter home to us) could &s;ee, that in Great Britain the ma&s;s of the people is melted into its Government, and that every di&s;pute with the

Mini&s;try mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be always a quarrel with the nation; they can &s;tand no longer in the equal and friendly relation of fellow-citizens to the &s;ubjects of this Kingdom. Humble as this relation may appear to &s;ome, when it is once broken, a &s;trong tie is di&s;&s;olved. Other &s;ort of connexions will be &s;ought. For, there are very few in the world, who will not pre|fer an u&s;eful ally to an in&s;olent ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Such di&s;cord has been the effect of the una|nimity into which &s;o many have of late been &s;educed or bullied, or into the appearance of which they have &s;unk through mere de&s;pair. They have been told that their di&s;&s;ent from violent mea&s;ures is an encouragement to re|bellion. Men of great pre&s;umption and little knowledge will hold a language Which is con|tradicted by the whole cour&s;e of hi&s;tory. <HI>Ge|neral</HI> rebellions and revolts of an whole peo|ple never were <HI>encouraged,</HI> now or at any time. They are always <HI>provoked.</HI> But if this un|heard-of doctrine of the encouragement of re|bellion were true, if it were true, that an a&s;|&s;urance of the friend&s;hip of numbers in this country towards the colonies, could become an encouragement to them to break off all con|nexion with it, what is the inference? Does any body &s;eriou&s;ly maintain, that, charged with my &s;hare of the public councils, I am obliged not to re&s;i&s;t projects which I think mi&s;|chievous, le&s;t men who &s;uffer &s;hould be en|couraged
<PB N="40" REF="39">
to re&s;i&s;t? The very tendency of &s;uch projects to produce rebellion is one of the chief rea&s;ons again&s;t them. Shall that rea&s;on not be given? Is it then a rule, that no man in this nation &s;hall open his mouth in favour of the Colonies, &s;hall defend their rights, or complain of their &s;ufferings? Or, when war finally breaks out, no man &s;hall expre&s;s his de|&s;ires of peace? Has this been the law of our pa&s;t, or is it to make the terms of our future connexion? Even looking no further than our|&s;elves, can it be true loyalty to any govern|ment, or true patrioti&s;m towards any country, to degrade their &s;olemn councils into &s;ervile drawing-rooms, to flatter their pride and pa&s;|&s;ions, rather than to enlighten their rea&s;on, and to prevent them from being cautioned again&s;t violence, le&s;t others &s;hould be encouraged to re&s;i&s;tance! By &s;uch acquie&s;cence great Kings and mighty nations have been undone; and if any are at this day in a perilous &s;ituation from rejecting truth, and li&s;tening to flattery, it would rather become them to reform the errors under which they &s;uffer, than to re|proach tho&s;e who have forewarned them of their danger.</P>
<P>But the rebels looked for a&s;&s;i&s;tance from this country. They did &s;o in the beginning of this controver&s;y mo&s;t certainly; and they &s;ought it by earne&s;t &s;upplications to Government, which dignity rejected, and by a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of com|merce,
<PB N="41" REF="40">
which the wealth of this nation enabled you to de&s;pi&s;e. When they found that neither prayers nor menaces had any &s;ort of weight, but that a firm re&s;olution was taken to re|duce them to unconditional obedience by a military force, they came to the la&s;t extremity. De&s;pairing of us, they tru&s;ted in them&s;elves. Not &s;trong enough them&s;elves, they &s;ought &s;uccour in France. In proportion as all en|couragement here le&s;&s;ened, their di&s;tance from this country encrea&s;ed. The encouragement is over; the alienation is compleat.</P>
<P>In order to produce this favourite unanimity in delu&s;ion, and to prevent all po&s;&s;ibility of a return to our antient happy concord, argu|ments for our continuance in this cour&s;e are drawn from the wretched &s;ituation it&s;elf into which we have been betrayed. It is &s;aid, that being at war with the Colonies, whatever our &s;entiments might have been before, all ties be|tween us are now di&s;&s;olved; and all the policy we have left is to &s;trengthen the hands of Government to reduce them. On the prin|ciple of this argument, the more mi&s;chiefs we &s;uffer from any admini&s;tration, the more our tru&s;t in it is to be confirmed. Let them but once get us into a war, their power is then &s;afe, and an act of oblivion pa&s;t for all their mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="41">But is it really true, that Government is always to be &s;trengthened with the in&s;truments of war, but never furni&s;hed with the means of peace? In former times mini&s;ters, I allow, have been &s;ometimes driven by the popular voice to a&s;&s;ert by arms the national honour again&s;t foreign powers. But the wi&s;dom of the nation has been far more clear, when tho&s;e mini&s;ters have been compelled to con&s;ult its intere&s;ts by treaty. We all know that the &s;en&s;e of the nation obliged the Court of King Charles the 2d, to abandon the <HI>Dutch war</HI>; a war next to the pre&s;ent the mo&s;t impolitic which we ever carried on. The good people of England con|&s;idered Holland as a &s;ort of dependency on this Kingdom; they dreaded to drive it to the pro|tection, or to &s;ubject it to the power of France, by their own incon&s;iderate ho&s;tility. They paid but little re&s;pect to the court jargon of that day: They were not inflamed by the pretended rival&s;hip of the Dutch in trade; by their Ma&s;|&s;acre at Amboyna, acted on the &s;tage to pro|voke the public vengeance; nor by declama|tions again&s;t the ingratitude of the United Provinces for the benefits England had confer|red upon them in their infant &s;tate. They were not moved from their evident intere&s;t by all the&s;e arts; nor was it enough to tell them, they were at war; that they mu&s;t go through with it; and that the cau&s;e of the di&s;pute was lo&s;t in the con&s;equences. The people of England were
<PB N="43" REF="42">
then, as they are now, called upon to make government &s;trong. They thought it a great deal better to make it wi&s;e and hone&s;t.</P>
<P>When I was among&s;t my con&s;tituents at the la&s;t Summer A&s;&s;izes, I remember that men of all de&s;criptions did then expre&s;s a very &s;trong de&s;ire for peace, and no &s;light hopes of attaining it from the commi&s;&s;ion &s;ent out by my lord Howe. And it is not a little remark|able, that in proportion as every per&s;on &s;hewed a zeal for the court mea&s;ures, he was at that time earne&s;t in circulating an opinion of the extent of the &s;uppo&s;ed powers of that com|mi&s;&s;ion. When I told them that lord Howe had no powers to treat, or to promi&s;e &s;atis|faction on any point what&s;oever of the con|trover&s;y, I was hardly credited; &s;o &s;trong and general was the de&s;ire of terminating this war by the method of accommodation. As far as I could di&s;cover, this was the temper then prevalent through the kingdom. The king's forces, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, had at that time been obliged to evacuate Bo&s;ton. The &s;upe|riority of the former campaign re&s;ted wholly with the Coloni&s;ts. If &s;uch powers of treaty were to be wi&s;hed, whil&s;t &s;ucce&s;s was very doubtful, how came they to be le&s;s &s;o, &s;ince his Maje&s;ty's arms have been crowned with many con&s;iderable advantages? Have the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es induced us to alter our mind, as thinking the &s;ea&s;on of victory not the time
<PB N="44" REF="43">
for treating with honour or advantage? Whatever changes have happened in the na|tional character, it can &s;carcely be our wi&s;h, that terms of accommodation never &s;hould be propo&s;ed to our enemy, except when they mu&s;t be attributed &s;olely to our fears. It has happened, let me &s;ay unfortunately, that we read of his Maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ion for making peace, and his troops evacuating his la&s;t town in the thirteen colonies at the &s;ame hour, and in the &s;ame Gazette. It was &s;till more unfor|tunate, that no commi&s;&s;ion went to America to &s;ettle the troubles there, until &s;everal months after an act had been pa&s;&s;ed to put the colonies out of the protection of this govern|ment, and to divide their trading property with|out a po&s;&s;ibility of re&s;titution, as &s;poil among the &s;eamen of the navy. The mo&s;t abject &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion on the part of the colonies could not redeem them. There was no man on that whole continent, or within three thou&s;and miles of it, qualified by law to follow alle|giance with protection, or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion with pardon. A proceeding of this kind has no example in hi&s;tory. Independency, and inde|pendency with an enmity (which putting our|&s;elves out of the que&s;tion would be called natu|ral and much provoked) was the inevitable con|&s;equence. How this came to pa&s;s, the nation may be one day in an humour to enquire.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="44">All the attempts made this &s;e&s;&s;ion to give fuller powers of peace to the commanders in America, were &s;tifled by the fatal confidence of victory, and the wild hopes of uncondi|tional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. There was a moment, fa|vourable to the king's arms, when if any powers of conce&s;&s;ion had exi&s;ted, on the other &s;ide of the Atlantick, even after all our errors, peace in all probability might have been re&s;|tored. But calamity is unhappily the u&s;ual &s;ea&s;on of reflexion; and the pride of men will not often &s;uffer rea&s;on to have any &s;cope until it can be no longer of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I have always wi&s;hed, that as the di&s;pute had its apparent origin from things done in Parlia|ment, and as the acts pa&s;&s;ed there had provoked the war, that the foundations of peace &s;hould be laid in Parliament al&s;o. I have been a&s;to|ni&s;hed to find, that tho&s;e who&s;e zeal for the dignity of our body was &s;o hot, as to light up the flames of civil war, &s;hould even publickly declare, that the&s;e delicate points ought to be wholly left to the Crown. Poorly as I may be thought affected to the authority of Parlia|ment, I &s;hall never admit that our con&s;titu|tional rights can ever become a matter of mi|ni&s;terial negociation.</P>
<P>I am charged with being an American. If warm affection, towards tho&s;e over whom I claim any &s;hare of authority, be a crime, I
<PB N="46" REF="45">
am guilty of this charge. But I do a&s;&s;ure you (and they who know me publickly and pri|vately will bear witne&s;s to me) that if ever one man lived, more zealous than another, for the &s;upremacy of Parliament, and the rights of this imperial Crown, it was my&s;elf. Many others indeed might be more knowing in the extent, or in the foundation of the&s;e rights. I do not pretend to be an Antiquary, or a Lawyer, or qualified for the chair of Pro|fe&s;&s;or in Metaphy&s;ics. I never ventured to put your &s;olid intere&s;ts upon &s;peculative grounds. My having con&s;tantly declined to do &s;o has been attributed to my incapacity for &s;uch di&s;qui&s;itions; and I am inclined to be|lieve it is partly the cau&s;e. I never &s;hall be a&s;hamed to confe&s;s, that where I am ignorant I am diffident. I am indeed not very &s;olli|citous to clear my&s;elf of this imputed inca|pacity; becau&s;e men, even le&s;s conver&s;ant than I am, in this kind of &s;ubtleties, and placed in &s;tations, to which I ought not to a&s;pire, have, by the mere force of civil di&s;cre|tion, often conducted the affairs of great na|tions with di&s;tingui&s;hed felicity and glory.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t came into a publick tru&s;t, I found your Parliament in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an un|limited legi&s;lative power over the Colonies. I could not open the Statute-Book, without &s;ee|ing the actual exerci&s;e of it, more or le&s;s, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever. This po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="47" REF="46">
with me for a title. It does &s;o in all human affairs. No man examines into the defects of his title to his paternal e&s;tate, or to his e&s;tabli&s;hed government. Indeed common &s;en&s;e taught me, that a legi&s;lative authority, not actually limited by the expre&s;s terms of its foundation, or by its own &s;ub&s;equent acts, cannot have its powers parcelled out by ar|gumentative di&s;tinctions, &s;o as to enable us to affirm, that here they can, and there they cannot bind. Nobody was &s;o obliging as to produce to me any record of &s;uch di&s;tinc|tions, by compact or otherwi&s;e, either at the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive formation of the &s;everal Colonies, or during the exi&s;tence of any of them. If other Gentlemen were able to &s;ee, how one power could be given up, (merely on ab&s;tract rea&s;oning) without giving up the re&s;t, I can only &s;ay, that they &s;aw further than I could; nor did I ever pre&s;ume to condemn any one for being clear-&s;ighted, when I was blind. I prai&s;e their penetration and learning; and hope that their practice has been corre&s;pondent to their theory.</P>
<P>I had indeed very earne&s;t wi&s;hes to keep the whole body of this authority perfect and entire as I found it, and to keep it &s;o, not for our advantage &s;olely, but principally for the &s;ake of tho&s;e, on who&s;e account all ju&s;t authority exi&s;ts; I mean the people to be governed. For I thought I &s;aw, that many ca&s;es might
<PB N="48" REF="47">
well happen, in which the exerci&s;e of every power, comprehended in the broade&s;t idea of legi&s;lature, might become, in its time and cir|cum&s;tances, not a little expedient for the peace and union of the Colonies among&s;t them&s;elves, as well as for their perfect har|mony with Great-Britain. Thinking &s;o, (perhaps erroneou&s;ly) but being hone&s;tly of that opinion, I was at the &s;ame time very &s;ure, that the authority of which I was &s;o jealous, could not, under the actual circum|&s;tances of our Plantations, be at all pre&s;erved in any of its members, but by the greate&s;t re&s;erve in its application; particularly in tho&s;e delicate points, in which the feelings of man|kind are the mo&s;t irritable. They who thought otherwi&s;e, have found a few more difficulties in their work, than (I hope) they were thoroughly aware of, when they under|took the pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, that it is not only the invidious branch of taxation that will be re&s;i&s;ted, but that no other given part of legi&s;lative rights can be &s;afely exerci&s;ed, without regard to the general opinion of tho&s;e who are to be governed. That general opi|nion is the vehicle, and organ of legi&s;lative omnipotence. Without this, the extent of legi&s;lative power may be a theory to entertain the mind, but it is nothing in the direction of affairs. The compleatne&s;s of the legi&s;lative
<PB N="49" REF="48">
authority of Parliament <HI>over this kingdom</HI> is not que&s;tioned; and yet there are many things indubitably included in the ab&s;tract idea of that power, and which carry no ab&s;olute in|ju&s;tice in them&s;elves, which, being contrary to the opinions and feelings of the people, can as little be exerci&s;ed, as if Parliament in &s;uch ca&s;es had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no right at all. I &s;ee no ab&s;tract rea&s;on, which can be given, why the &s;ame power that made and repealed the High Commi&s;&s;ion Court and the Star Chamber, might not revive them again; and the&s;e courts, warned by their former fate, might po&s;&s;ibly exerci&s;e their powers with &s;ome degree of ju&s;tice. But the madne&s;s would be as unque&s;tionable, as the competence, of that Parliament, which &s;hould make &s;uch attempts. If any thing can be &s;uppo&s;ed out of the power of human legi&s;lature, it is Re|ligion; I admit however that the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of this country has been three or four times altered by act of parliament; and there|fore that a &s;tatute binds even in that ca&s;e. But we may very &s;afely affirm, that notwith|&s;tanding this apparent omnipotence, it would be now found as impo&s;&s;ible for King and Par|liament to change the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of this country, as it was to King <HI>James</HI> alone, when he attempted to make &s;uch an altera|tion without a Parliament. In effect, to fol|low, not to force the publick inclination; to give a direction, a form, a technical dre&s;s and
<PB N="50" REF="49">
a &s;pecifick &s;anction, to the general &s;en&s;e of the community, is the true end of legi&s;lature. When it goes beyond this, its authority will be precarious, let its rights be what they will.</P>
<P>It is &s;o with regard to the exerci&s;e of all the powers, which our con&s;titution knows in any of its parts, and indeed to the &s;ub&s;tantial exi&s;t|ence of any of the parts them&s;elves. The King's negative to bills is one of the mo&s;t in|di&s;puted of the royal prerogatives; and it ex|tends to all ca&s;es what&s;oever. I am far from certain, that if &s;everal laws, which I know, had fallen under the &s;troke of that &s;ceptre, that the publick would have had a very heavy lo&s;s. But it is not the <HI>propriety</HI> of the ex|erci&s;e which is in que&s;tion. The exerci&s;e it&s;elf is wi&s;ely foreborne. Its repo&s;e may be the pre&s;ervation of its exi&s;tence; and its ex|i&s;tence may be the means of &s;aving the con|&s;titution it&s;elf, on an occa&s;ion worthy of bringing it forth.</P>
<P>As the di&s;putants, who&s;e accurate and lo|gical rea&s;onings have brought us into our pre|&s;ent condition, think it ab&s;urd that powers, or members of any con&s;titution &s;hould exi&s;t, rarely if ever to be exerci&s;ed, I hope, I &s;hall be excu&s;ed in mentioning another in&s;tance, that is material. We know, that the Convo|cation of the Clergy had formerly been called,
<PB N="51" REF="50">
and &s;at with nearly as much regularity to bu&s;i|ne&s;s as Parliament it&s;elf. It is now called for form only. It &s;its for the purpo&s;e of making &s;ome polite eccle&s;ia&s;tical compliments to the King; and when that grace is &s;aid, retires and is heard of no more. It is however <HI>a part of the Con&s;titution,</HI> and may be called out into act and energy, whenever there is occa&s;ion; and whenever tho&s;e, who conjure up that &s;pirit, will choo&s;e to abide the con&s;equences. It is wi&s;e to permit its legal exi&s;tence; it is much wi&s;er to continue it a legal exi&s;tence only. So truly has Prudence, (con&s;tituted as the God of this lower world) the entire dominion over every exerci&s;e of power, committed into its hands; and yet I have lived to &s;ee prudence and conformity to circum&s;tances, wholly &s;et at naught in our late controver&s;ies, and treated as if they were the mo&s;t contemptible and irrational of all things. I have heard it an hundred times very gravely alledged, that in order to keep power in wind, it was nece&s;&s;ary, by preference, to exert it in tho&s;e very points in which it was mo&s;t likely to be re&s;i&s;ted, and the lea&s;t likely to be productive of any advantage.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the con&s;iderations, Gentlemen, which led me early to think, that in the com|prehen&s;ive dominion which the divine Provi|dence had put into our hands, in&s;tead of trou|bling our under&s;tandings with &s;peculations
<PB N="52" REF="51">
concerning the unity of empire, and the iden|tity or di&s;tinction of legi&s;lative powers, and inflaming our pa&s;&s;ions with the heat and pride of controver&s;y, it was our duty, in all &s;ober|ne&s;s, to conform our Government to the cha|racter and circum&s;tances of the &s;everal people who compo&s;e this mighty and &s;trangely di|ver&s;ified ma&s;s. I never was wild enough to conceive, that one method would &s;erve for the whole; I could never conceive that the na|tives of <HI>Hindo&s;tan</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Virginia</HI> could be ordered in the &s;ame manner; or that the <HI>Cutchery</HI> Court and the grand Jury of <HI>Salem</HI> could be regulated on a &s;imilar plan. I was per&s;uaded, that Government was a practical thing, made for the happine&s;s of mankind, and not to furni&s;h out a &s;pectacle of uni|formity, to gratify the &s;chemes of vi&s;ionary politicians. Our bu&s;ine&s;s was to rule, not to wrangle; and it would have been a poor com|pen&s;ation that we had triumphed in a di&s;pute, whil&s;t we lo&s;t an empire.</P>
<P>If there be one fact in the world perfectly clear, it is this;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the di&s;po&s;ition of the people of America is wholly aver&s;e to any other than a free Government;"</Q>  and this known character of the people is indication enough to any hone&s;t &s;tate&s;man, how he ought to adapt whatever power he finds in his hands to their ca&s;e.
If any a&s;k me what a free Government is? I an&s;wer, that, for any

<P>Civil freedom, gentlemen, is not, as many have endeavoured to per&s;uade you, a thing that lies hid in the depths of ab&s;tru&s;e &s;cience. It is a ble&s;&s;ing and a benefit, not an ab&s;tract &s;peculation; and all the ju&s;t rea&s;oning that can be upon it, is of &s;o coar&s;e a texture, as perfectly to &s;uit the ordinary capacities of tho&s;e who are to enjoy, and of tho&s;e who are to defend it. Far from any re&s;emblance to tho&s;e propo&s;itions in Geometry and Metaphy|&s;ics, which admit no medium, but mu&s;t be true or fal&s;e in all their latitude, &s;ocial and civil freedom, like all other things in com|mon life, are variou&s;ly mixed and modified, enjoyed in very different degrees, and &s;haped
<PB N="55" REF="54">
into an infinite diver&s;ity of forms, according to the temper and circum&s;tances of every com|munity. The <HI>extreme</HI> of liberty (which is its ab&s;tract perfection, but its real fault) obtains no where, nor ought to obtain any where. Becau&s;e extremes, as we all know, in every point which relates either to our duties or &s;a|tisfactions in life, are de&s;tructive both to virtue and enjoyment. Liberty too mu&s;t be limited in order to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The degree of re&s;traint it is impo&s;&s;ible in any ca&s;e to &s;ettle preci&s;ely. But it ought to be the con&s;tant aim of every wi&s;e publick coun&s;el, to find out by cautious experiments, and rational, cool endeavours, with how little, not how much of this re&s;traint, the community can &s;ub&s;i&s;t. For liberty is a good to be improved, and not an evil to be le&s;&s;ened. It is not only a private ble&s;&s;ing of the fir&s;t order, but the vital &s;pring and energy of the &s;tate it&s;elf, which has ju&s;t &s;o much life and vigour as there is liberty in it. But whether liberty be advantageous or not, (for I know it is a fa&s;hion to decry the very principle) none will di&s;pute that peace is a ble&s;&s;ing; and peace mu&s;t in the cour&s;e of hu|man affairs be frequently bought by &s;ome in|dulgence and toleration at lea&s;t to liberty. For as the Sabbath (though of divine in&s;titu|tion) was made for man, not man for the Sab|bath, government, which can claim no higher origin or authority, in its exerci&s;e at lea&s;t, ought to conform to the exigencies of the time

and the temper and character of the people, with whom it is concerned; and not always to attempt violently to bend the people to their theories of &s;ubjection.

opinion and practice at lea&s;t) or they will not be provinces at all. I know, and have long felt, the difficulty of reconciling the unwieldy haughtine&s;s of a great ruling nation, habituated to command, pampered by enormous wealth, and confident from a long cour&s;e of pro&s;perity and victory, to the high &s;pirit of free depen|dencies, animated with the fir&s;t glow and acti|vity of juvenile heat, and a&s;&s;uming to them|&s;elves as their birth-right, &s;ome part of that very pride which oppre&s;&s;es them. They who perceive no difficulty in reconciling the&s;e tem|pers, (which however to make peace mu&s;t &s;ome way or other be reconciled), are much above my capacity, or much below the magnitude of the bu&s;ine&s;s. Of one thing I am perfectly clear, that it is not by deciding the &s;uit, but by compromi&s;ing the difference, that peace can be re&s;tored or kept. They who would put an end to &s;uch quarrels, by declaring roundly in favour of the whole demands of either party, have mi&s;taken in my humble opinion, the office of a mediator.</P>
<P>The war is now of full two years &s;tanding; the controver&s;y of many more. In different periods of the di&s;pute, different methods of re|conciliation were to be pur&s;ued.

The Colonies were from the beginning &s;ubject to the legi&s;lature of Great Britain, on princi|ples which they never examined; and we per|mitted to them many local privileges, without a&s;king how they agreed with that legi&s;lative authority. Modes of admini&s;tration were formed in an in&s;en&s;ible, and very un&s;y&s;tematick manner. But they gradually adapted them|&s;elves to the varying condition of things.&mdash;What was fir&s;t a &s;ingle kingdom &s;tretched into an empire; and an imperial &s;uperintendency of &s;ome kind or other became nece&s;&s;ary. Parlia|ment, from a mere repre&s;entative of the people, and a guardian of popular privileges for its own immediate con&s;tituents, grew into a mighty &s;overeign. In&s;tead of being a control on the Crown on its own behalf, it communi|cated a &s;ort of &s;trength to the Royal authority; which was wanted for the con&s;ervation of a new object, but which could not be &s;afely tru&s;ted to the Crown alone. On the other hand, the Colonies advancing by equal &s;teps, and governed by the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity, had form|ed within them&s;elves, either by royal in&s;truc|tion, or royal charter, a&s;&s;emblies &s;o exceed|ingly re&s;embling a parliament, in all their forms, functions, and powers, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould not imbibe &s;ome opinion of a &s;imilar authority.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t de&s;ignation of the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, they were probably not intended for any thing
<PB N="59" REF="58">
more, (nor perhaps did they think them&s;elves much higher) than the municipal corporations within this I&s;land, to which &s;ome at pre&s;ent love to compare them. But nothing in pro|gre&s;&s;ion can re&s;t on its original plan. We may as well think of rocking a grown man in the cradle of an infant. Therefore, as the Colonies pro&s;pered and encrea&s;ed to a numerous and mighty people, &s;preading over a very great tract of the globe; it was natural that they &s;hould attribute to a&s;&s;emblies, &s;o re&s;pectable in their formal con&s;titution, &s;ome part of the dig|nity of the great nations which they repre&s;ent|ed. No longer tied to bye-laws, the&s;e a&s;&s;emb|lies made acts of all &s;orts and in all ca&s;es what|&s;oever. They levied money, not for parochial purpo&s;es, but upon regular grants to the Crown, following all the rules and principles of a Parliament, to which they approached every day more and more nearly. Tho&s;e who think them&s;elves wi&s;er than Providence and &s;tronger than the cour&s;e of nature, may com|plain of all this variation, on the one &s;ide or the other, as their &s;everal humours and pre|judices may lead them. But things could not be otherwi&s;e; and Engli&s;h Colonies mu&s;t be had on the&s;e terms, or not had at all. In the mean time neither party felt any inconvenience from this double legi&s;lature, to which they had been formed by imperceptible habits, and old cu&s;tom, the great &s;upport of all the govern|ments in the world. Though the&s;e two legi&s;|latures
<PB N="60" REF="59">
were &s;ometimes found perhaps per|forming the very &s;ame functions, they did not very gro&s;sly or &s;y&s;tematically cla&s;h. In all likelyhood this aro&s;e from mere neglect; po&s;|&s;ibly from the natural operation of things, which, left to them&s;elves, generally fall into their proper order. But whatever was the cau&s;e, it is certain, that a regular revenue by the authority of Parliament for the &s;upport of civil and military e&s;tabli&s;hments, &s;eems not to have been thought of until the Colonies were too proud to &s;ubmit, too &s;trong to be forced, too enlightened not to &s;ee all the con&s;equences which mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>If ever this &s;cheme of taxation was to be pu&s;hed again&s;t the inclinations of the people, it was evident, that di&s;cu&s;&s;ions mu&s;t ari&s;e, which would let loo&s;e all the elements that compo&s;ed this double con&s;titution; would &s;hew how much each of their members had departed from its original principles; and would di&s;|cover contradictions in each legi&s;lature, as well to its own fir&s;t principles, as to its relation to the other, very difficult if not ab&s;olutely im|po&s;&s;ible to be reconciled.</P>
<P>Therefore at the fir&s;t fatal opening of this conte&s;t, the wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e &s;eemed to be to put an end as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to the immediate cau&s;es of the di&s;pute; and to quiet a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, not ea&s;ily &s;ettled upon clear principles, and
<PB N="61" REF="60">
ari&s;ing from claims, which pride would permit neither party to abandon, by re&s;orting as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, to the old &s;ucce&s;sful cour&s;e. A mere repeal of the obnoxious tax, with a de|claration of the legi&s;lative authority of this kingdom, was then fully &s;ufficient to procure peace to <HI>both &s;ides.</HI> Man is a creature of habit; and the fir&s;t breach being of very &s;hort con|tinuance, the Colonies fell back exactly into their antient &s;tate. The Congre&s;s has u&s;ed an expre&s;&s;ion with regard to this pacification which appears to me truly &s;ignificant. After the re|peal of the Stamp Act, <Q REND="inline">"the Colonies fell,"</Q> &s;ays this a&s;&s;embly,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"into their antient &s;tate of <HI>un&s;u&s;pecting confidence in the Mother Country.</HI>"</Q>
This un&s;u&s;pecting confidence is the true center of gravity among&s;t mankind, about which all the parts are at re&s;t. It is this <HI>un&s;u&s;pecting con|fidence</HI> that removes all difficulties, and recon|ciles all the contradictions which occur in the complexity of all antient puzzled political e&s;ta|bli&s;hments. Happy are the rulers which have the &s;ecret of pre&s;erving it!</P>
<P>The whole empire has rea&s;on to remember with eternal gratitude, the wi&s;dom and temper of that man and his excellent a&s;&s;ociates, who, to recover this confidence, formed the plan of pacification in 1766. That plan, being built upon the nature of man, and the circum&s;tances and habits of the two countries, and not on any vi&s;ionary &s;peculations, perfectly an&s;wered
<PB N="62" REF="61">
its end, as long as it was thought proper to ad|here to it. Without giving a rude &s;hock to the dignity (well or ill under&s;tood) of this Parliament, it gave perfect content to our de|pendencies. Had it not been for the mediato|rial &s;pirit and talents of that great man, be|tween &s;uch cla&s;hing preten&s;ions and pa&s;&s;ions, we &s;hould then have ru&s;hed headlong (I know what I &s;ay) into the calamities of that civil war, in which, by departing from his &s;y&s;tem, we are at length involved; and we &s;hould have been precipitated into that war, at a time, when cir|cum&s;tances both at home and abroad were far, very far, more unfavourable unto us than they were at the breaking out of the pre&s;ent troubles.</P>
<P>I had the happine&s;s of giving my fir&s;t votes in Parliament for that pacification. I was one of tho&s;e almo&s;t unanimous members, who, in the nece&s;&s;ary conce&s;&s;ions of Parliament, would as much as po&s;&s;ible have pre&s;erved its autho|rity, and re&s;pected its honour. I could not at once tear from my heart prejudices which were dear to me, and which bore a re&s;emblance to virtues. I had then, and I have &s;till, my partia|lities. What Parliament gave up I wi&s;hed to be given, as of grace, and favour, and affec|tion, and not as a re&s;titution of &s;tolen goods. High dignity relented as it was &s;oothed; and an act of benignity from old acknowledged greatne&s;s had its full effect on our dependen|cies. Our unlimited declaration of legi&s;lative
<PB N="63" REF="62">
authority produced not a &s;ingle murmur. If this undefined power has become odious &s;ince that time, and full of horror to the Colonies, it is becau&s;e the <HI>un&s;u&s;picious confidence</HI> is lo&s;t; and the parental affection, in the bo&s;om of who&s;e boundle&s;s authority they repo&s;ed their privileges, is become e&s;tranged and ho&s;tile.</P>
<P>It will be a&s;ked, if &s;uch was then my opinion of the mode of pacification, how I came to be the very per&s;on who moved, not only for a re|peal of all the late coercive &s;tatutes, but for mutilating, by a po&s;itive law, the entirene&s;s of the legi&s;lative power of Parliament, and cutting off from it the whole right of taxation? I an&s;wer, becau&s;e a different &s;tate of things re|quires a different conduct. When the di&s;pute had gone to the la&s;t extremities (which no man laboured more to prevent than I did) the conce&s;&s;ions which had &s;atisfied in the beginning, could &s;atisfy no longer; the violation of tacit faith required explicit &s;ecurity. The &s;ame cau&s;e, which has introduced all formal com|pacts and covenants among men made it ne|ce&s;&s;ary: I mean, habits of &s;orene&s;s, jealou&s;y, and di&s;tru&s;t. I parted with it, as with a limb: but as with a limb to &s;ave the body; and I would have parted with more, if more had been nece&s;&s;ary. Any thing rather than a fruit|le&s;s, hopele&s;s, unnatural civil war. This mode of yielding would, it is &s;aid, give way to independency, without a war. I am per|&s;uaded
<PB N="64" REF="63">
from the nature of things, and from every information, that it would have had a directly contrary effect. But if it had this ef|fect, I confe&s;s, that I &s;hould prefer indepen|dency without war, to independency with it; and I have &s;o much tru&s;t in the inclinations and prejudices of mankind, and &s;o little in any thing el&s;e, that I &s;hould expect ten times more benefit to this Kingdom from the affection of America, though under a &s;eparate e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, than from her perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Crown and Parliament, accompanied with her terror, di&s;gu&s;t, and abhorrence. Bodies tied together by &s;o unnatural a bond of union, as mutual hatred, are only connected to their ruin.</P>
<P>One hundred and ten re&s;pectable Members of Parliament voted for that conce&s;&s;ion. Many not pre&s;ent, when the motion was made, were of the &s;entiments of tho&s;e who voted. I knew it would then have made peace. I am not without hopes that it would do &s;o at pre&s;ent, if it were adopted. No benefit, no revenue, could be lo&s;t by it. For be fully a&s;&s;ured, that, of all the phantoms that ever deluded the fond hopes of a credulous world, a parliamentary revenue in the Colonies is the mo&s;t perfectly chime|rical. Your breaking them to any &s;ubjection, far from relieving your burthens, (the pretext for this war,) will never pay that military force which will be kept up to the de&s;truction

<P>Gentlemen; you have my opinion on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of public affairs. Mean as the&s;e opinions may be in them&s;elves, your partiality has made them of &s;ome importance. Without troubling my&s;elf to enquire whether I am under a formal obligation to it, I have a plea|&s;ure in accounting for my conduct to my Con|&s;tituents. I feel warmly on this &s;ubject, and I expre&s;s my&s;elf as I feel. If I pre&s;ume to blame any public proceeding, I cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed to be per&s;onal. Would to God I could be &s;u&s;pected of it. My fault might be greater, but the public calamity would be le&s;s exten&s;ive. If my conduct has not been able to make any impre&s;&s;ion on the warm part of that antient and powerful party, with who&s;e &s;upport, I was not honoured at my Election; on my &s;ide, my re&s;pect, regard, and duty to them is not at all le&s;&s;ened. I owe the Gentlemen who compo&s;e it my mo&s;t humble &s;ervice in every thing. I hope that whenever any of them were plea&s;ed to command me, that they found me perfectly equal in my obedience. But flattery and friend&s;hip are very different things; and to mi&s;lead is not to &s;erve them. I cannot purcha&s;e the favour of any man by concealing from him what I think his ruin.</P>

<P>Not that I think it fit for any one to rely too much on his own under&s;tanding; or to be filled with a pre&s;umption, not becoming a Chri&s;tian man, in his own per&s;onal &s;tability and rectitude.

If I have wandered out of the paths of rectitude, into tho&s;e of intere&s;ted faction, it was in company with the Saviles, the Dowde&s;wells, the Went-worths, the Bentincks; with the Lenoxes, the Manche&s;ters, the Keppels, the Saunders's; with the temperate, permanent, hereditary virtue of the whole hou&s;e of Cavendi&s;h; names, among which, &s;ome have extended your fame and empire in arms, and all have fought the battle of your liberties in fields not le&s;s glorious.&mdash;The&s;e, and many more like the&s;e, grafting public principles on private honour, have re|deemed the pre&s;ent age, and would have adorn|ed the mo&s;t &s;plendid period in your hi&s;tory.

But that it &s;hould be heard among tho&s;e who pretend to be &s;trong a&s;&s;ertors of liberty, is not only &s;ur|pri&s;ing, but hardly natural. This moral level|ling is a <HI>&s;ervile principle.</HI> It leads to practical pa&s;&s;ive obedience far better, than all the doc|trines, which the pliant accommodation of Theology to power, has ever produced. It cuts up by the roots, not only all idea of forci|ble re&s;i&s;tance, but even of civil oppo&s;ition. It di&s;po&s;es men to an abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, not by opinion, which may be &s;haken by argument or altered by pa&s;&s;ion, but by the &s;trong ties of public and private intere&s;t. For if all men who act in a public &s;ituation are equally &s;elfi&s;h, corrupt, and venal, what rea&s;on can be given for de&s;iring any &s;ort of change, which, be&s;ides the evils which mu&s;t attend all changes, can be productive of no po&s;&s;ible advantage? The active men in the &s;tate are true &s;amples of the ma&s;s. If they are univer&s;ally depraved, the common-wealth it&s;elf is not found. We may amu&s;e our&s;elves with talking as much as we plea&s;e of the virtue of middle or humble life; that is, we may place our confidence in the virtue of tho&s;e who have never been tried. But if the per&s;ons who are continually emerging out of that &s;phere, be no better than tho&s;e whom
<PB N="71" REF="70">
birth has placed above it, what hopes are there in the remainder of the body which is to fur|ni&s;h the perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the &s;tate? All who have ever written on government, are unanimous, that among a people generally cor|rupt, liberty cannot long exi&s;t. And indeed how is it po&s;&s;ible? when tho&s;e who are to make the laws, to guards, to enforce, or to obey them, are, by a tacit confederacy of manners, indi&s;po&s;ed to the &s;pirit of all generous and noble in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>I am aware that the age is not what we all wi&s;h. But I am &s;ure, that the only means of checking its precipitate degeneracy, is heartily to concur with whatever is the be&s;t in our time; and to have &s;ome more correct &s;tandard of judging what that be&s;t is, than the tran&s;ient and uncertain favour of a court. If once we are able to find, and can prevail on our&s;elves to &s;trengthen an union of &s;uch men, whatever accidentally becomes indi&s;po&s;ed to ill-exerci&s;ed power, even by the ordinary operation of hu|man pa&s;&s;ions, mu&s;t join with that &s;ociety, and cannot long be joined, without in &s;ome degree a&s;&s;imilating to it. Virtue will catch as well as vice by contact; and the public &s;tock of hone&s;t manly principle will daily accumulate. We are not too nicely to &s;crutinize motives as long as action is irreproachable. It is enough, (and for a worthy man perhaps too much) to
<PB N="72" REF="71">
deal out its infamy to convicted guilt and de|clared apo&s;tacy.</P>
<P>To act on the principles of the con&s;titution, with the be&s;t men the time affords, has been from the beginning the rule of my conduct; and I mean to continue it, as long as &s;uch a body as I have de&s;cribed, can by any po&s;&s;ibility be kept together. For I &s;hould think it the mo&s;t dreadful of all offences, not only towards the pre&s;ent generation but to all the future, if I were to do any thing which could make the minute&s;t breach in this great con&s;ervatory of free principles. Tho&s;e who perhaps have the &s;ame intentions, but are &s;eparated by &s;ome little political animo&s;ities, will, I hope, di&s;cern at la&s;t, how little conducive it is to any rational purpo&s;e, to lower its reputation. For my part, Gentlemen, from much experience, from no little thinking, and from comparing a great variety of things, I am thoroughly per&s;uaded, that the la&s;t hopes of pre&s;erving the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, or of re-uniting the di&s;&s;ipated members of the Engli&s;h race upon a common plan of tranquillity and liberty, does entirely depend on the firm and la&s;ting union of &s;uch men; and above all on their keeping them&s;elves from that de&s;pair, which is &s;o very apt to fall on tho&s;e, whom a violence of cha|racter, and a mixture of ambitious views, do not &s;upport through a long, painful, and un|&s;ucce&s;sful &s;truggle.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="72">There never, Gentlemen, was a period in which the &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s of &s;ome men has been put to &s;o &s;ore a trial. It is not very difficult for well-formed minds to abandon their in|tere&s;t; but the &s;eparation of fame and virtue is an har&s;h divorce. Liberty is in danger of being made unpopular to Engli&s;hmen. Con|tending for an imaginary power, we begin to acquire the &s;pirit of domination, and to lo&s;e the reli&s;h of hone&s;t equality. The principles of our forefathers become &s;u&s;pected to us, be|cau&s;e we &s;ee them animating the pre&s;ent oppo|&s;ition of our children. The faults which grow out of the luxuriance of freedom, appear much more &s;hocking to us, than the ba&s;e vices which are generated from the rankne&s;s of &s;ervitude. Accordingly the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance to power ap|pears more inexcu&s;eable in our eyes than the greate&s;t abu&s;es of authority. All dread of a &s;tanding military force is looked upon as a &s;u|per&s;titious panick. All &s;hame of calling in foreigners and &s;avages in a civil conte&s;t is worn off. We grow indifferent to the con&s;equences inevitable to our&s;elves from the plan of ruling half the empire by a mercenary &s;word. We are taught to believe, that a de&s;ire of domi|neering over our countrymen, is love to our country; that tho&s;e who hate civil war abet rebellion; and that the amiable and concilia|tory virtues of lenity, moderation, and ten|derne&s;s to the privileges of tho&s;e who depend
<PB N="74" REF="73">
on this kingdom, are a &s;ort of trea&s;on to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould remain long in a &s;ituation, which breeds &s;uch notions and di&s;|po&s;itions, without &s;ome great alreration in the national character. Tho&s;e ingenuous and feel|ing minds, who are &s;o fortified again&s;t all other things, and &s;o unarmed to whatever approaches in the &s;hape of di&s;grace, finding the principles, which they con&s;idered as &s;ure means of honour, to be grown into di&s;repute, will retire di&s;heart|ened and di&s;gu&s;ted. Tho&s;e of a more robu&s;t make, the bold, able, ambitious men, who pay &s;ome part of their court to power through the people, and &s;ub&s;titute the voice of tran&s;ient opinion in the place of true glory, will give into the general mode. The &s;uperior under|&s;tandings, which ought to correct vulgar preju|dice, will confirm and aggravate its errors. Many things have been long operating towards a gradual change in our principles. But this American war has done more in a very few years than all the other cau&s;es could have ef|fected in a century. It is therefore not on its own &s;eparate account, but becau&s;e of its atten|dant circum&s;tances, that I con&s;ider its conti|nuance, or its ending in any way but that of an honourable and liberal accommodation, as the greate&s;t evils which can befal us. For that rea&s;on I have troubled you with this long letter. For that rea&s;on I intreat you again and again, nei|ther
<PB N="75" REF="74">
to be per&s;waded, &s;hamed, or frighted out of the principles that have hitherto led &s;o many of you to abhor the war, its cau&s;e, and its con&s;equences. Let us not be among&s;t the fir&s;t who renounce the maxims of our fore|fathers.</P>
