<HEAD>AN EPISTLE To the Right Honourable Sir <HI>ROBERT WALPOLE.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THO' Strength of Genius, by Experience taught,</L>
<L>Gives Thee to found the Depths of human Thought,</L>
<L>To trace the various Workings of the Mind,</L>
<L>And rule the &s;ecret Springs, that rule Mankind;</L>
<L>(Rare Gifts!) yet, WALPOLE, wilt thou conde&s;cend</L>
<L>To li&s;ten, if thy unexperienc'd Friend</L>
<L>Can ought of U&s;e impart, tho' void of Skill,</L>
<L>And win Attention by &s;incere good Will;</L>
<L>For Friend&s;hip, &s;ometimes, Want of Parts &s;upplies,</L>
<L>The Heart may furni&s;h what the Head denies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<L>As when the rapid <HI>Rhone,</HI> o'er &s;welling Tides,</L>
<L>To grace old <HI>Ocean</HI>'s Court, in Triumph rides;</L>
<L>Tho' rich his Source, he drains a thou&s;and Springs,</L>
<L>Nor &s;corns the Tribute each &s;mall Riv'let brings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So thou &s;halt hence ab&s;orb each feeble Ray,</L>
<L>Each Dawn of Meaning, in thy brighter Day;</L>
<L>Shalt like; or where thou can'&s;t not like, excu&s;e,</L>
<L>Since no mean Intere&s;t &s;hall prophane the Mu&s;e:</L>
<L>No Malice wrapp'd in Truth's Di&s;gui&s;e, offend,</L>
<L>Nor Flattery taint the Freedom of the Friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When fir&s;t a generous Mind &s;urveys the Great,</L>
<L>And views the Crowds that on their Fortune wait;</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the Show (tho' little under&s;tood)</L>
<L>He only &s;eeks the Power, to do the Good;</L>
<L>Thinks, 'till he tries, 'tis Godlike to di&s;po&s;e,</L>
<L>And Gratitude &s;till &s;prings, where Bounty flows;</L>
<L>That every Grant &s;incere Affection wins,</L>
<L>And where our Wants have End, our Love begins:</L>
<L>But tho&s;e who long the Paths of State have trod,</L>
<L>Learn from the Clamours of the murmuring Crowd;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="4">
Which cramm'd, yet craving &s;till, their Gates be&s;iege,</L>
<L>'Tis ea&s;ier far to give, than to oblige.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This of Thy Conduct &s;eems the nice&s;t Part,</L>
<L>The chief Perfection of the State&s;man's Art,</L>
<L>To give to fair A&s;&s;ent a fairer Face,</L>
<L>And &s;often a Refu&s;al into Grace.</L>
<L>But few there are that can be truly kind,</L>
<L>Or know to fix their Favours on the Mind:</L>
<L>Hence &s;ome, whene'er they would oblige, offend;</L>
<L>And while they make the Fortune, lo&s;e the Friend:</L>
<L>Still give unthank'd, &s;till &s;quander, not be&s;tow;</L>
<L>For great Men want not, what to give, but how.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Race of Men that follow Courts, 'tis true,</L>
<L>Think all they get, and more than all their Due:</L>
<L>Still ask, but ne'er con&s;ult their own De&s;erts;</L>
<L>And mea&s;ure by their Intere&s;t, not their Parts.</L>
<L>From this Mi&s;take, &s;o many Men we &s;ee,</L>
<L>But ill become the Thing they wi&s;h'd to be;</L>
<L>Hence Di&s;content, and fre&s;h Demands ari&s;e,</L>
<L>More Power, more Favour in the Great Man's Eyes:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5">
All feel a Want, tho' none the Cau&s;e &s;u&s;pects,</L>
<L>And hate their Patron, for their own Defects;</L>
<L>Such none can plea&s;e, but who reforms their Hearts,</L>
<L>And, when he gives them Places, gives them Parts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As the&s;e o'erprize their Worth, &s;o &s;ure the Great</L>
<L>May &s;ell their Favour at too dear a Rate;</L>
<L>When Merit pines, while Clamour is preferr'd,</L>
<L>And long Attachment waits among the Herd;</L>
<L>When no Di&s;tinction, where Di&s;tinction's due,</L>
<L>Marks from the many, the Superior few;</L>
<L>When &s;trong Cabal con&s;trains them to be ju&s;t,</L>
<L>And makes them give at la&s;t&mdash;becau&s;e they mu&s;t</L>
<L>What Hopes that Men of real Worth &s;hould prize,</L>
<L>What neither Friend&s;hip gives, nor Merit buys!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Man who ju&s;tly o'er the Whole pre&s;ides,</L>
<L>His well weigh'd Choice, with wi&s;e Affections, guides;</L>
<L>Knows when to &s;top with Grace, and when advance,</L>
<L>Nor gives from Importunity, or Chance;</L>
<L>But thinks how little Gratitude is ow'd,</L>
<L>When Favours are extorted, not be&s;tow'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
<L>When &s;afe on Shore our&s;elves, we &s;ee the Crowd</L>
<L>Surround the Great, importunate and loud;</L>
<L>Thro' &s;uch a Tumult, 'tis no ea&s;y Task</L>
<L>To drive the Man of real Worth to ask:</L>
<L>Surrounded thus, and giddy with the Show,</L>
<L>'Tis hard for great Men, rightly to be&s;tow;</L>
<L>From hence &s;o few are skill'd, in either Ca&s;e,</L>
<L>To ask with Dignity, or give with Grace.</L>
<L>Sometimes the Great, &s;educ'd by Love of Parts,</L>
<L>Con&s;ult our Genius, but neglect our Hearts;</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the glitt'ring Sparks, that Genius flings,</L>
<L>They lift us cow'ring on their Eagles Wings,</L>
<L>Mark out the Flights, by which them&s;elves begun,</L>
<L>And teach our dazzled Eyes to bear the Sun;</L>
<L>Till we forget the Hand that made us great,</L>
<L>And grow to envy, not to emulate.</L>
<L>To emulate, a general Warmth implies,</L>
<L>To reach the Virtues, that make great Men ri&s;e;</L>
<L>But Envy wears a mean malignant Face,</L>
<L>And aims not at their Virtues, but their Place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such to oblige, how vain is the Pretence?</L>
<L>When every Favour is a fre&s;h Offence,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7">
By which &s;uperior Power is &s;till imply'd,</L>
<L>And, while it helps their Fortune, hurts their Pride.</L>
<L>Slight is the Hate, Neglect or Hard&s;hips breed;</L>
<L>But tho&s;e, who hate from Envy, hate indeed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since &s;o perplex'd the Choice; whom &s;hall we tru&s;t,</L>
<L>Methinks I hear thee cry, the Brave and Ju&s;t.</L>
<L>The Man by no mean Fears, or Hopes controul'd,</L>
<L>Who &s;erves thee from Affection, not for Gold.</L>
<L>Who love the Hone&s;t, and e&s;teem the Brave,</L>
<L>De&s;pi&s;e the Coxcomb, but dete&s;t the Knave,</L>
<L>No Shew of Parts the truly wi&s;e &s;educe,</L>
<L>To think that Knaves can be of real U&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Man, who contradicts the publick Voice,</L>
<L>And &s;trives to dignify a worthle&s;s Choice,</L>
<L>Attempts a Task, that on that Choice reflects,</L>
<L>And lends us Light to point out new Defects.</L>
<L>One worthle&s;s Man, that gains what he pretends,</L>
<L>Di&s;gu&s;ts a thou&s;and unpretending Friends:</L>
<L>And &s;ince no Art can make a Counter pa&s;s,</L>
<L>Or add the Weight of Gold to mimick Bra&s;s;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="8">
When Princes to bad Oar their Image join,</L>
<L>They more deba&s;e the Stamp, than rai&s;e the Coin.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be thine the Care, true Merit to reward,</L>
<L>And gain the Good,&mdash;nor will that Task be hard;</L>
<L>Souls form'd alike, &s;o quick, by Nature blend;</L>
<L>An hone&s;t Man is more than half thy Friend.</L>

<LG>
<L>Him no mean Views, or Ha&s;te to ri&s;e, &s;hall &s;way,</L>
<L>Thy Choice to &s;ully, or thy Tru&s;t betray:</L>

<L>Nor is Wit dangerous in an hone&s;t Hand:</L>
<L>Be&s;ides, if Failings at the Bottom lie,</L>
<L>We view tho&s;e Failings with a Lover's Eye.</L>
<L>Tho' &s;mall his Genius, let him do his be&s;t;</L>
<L>Our Wi&s;hes and Relief &s;upply the re&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let others barter &s;ervile Faith for Gold,</L>
<L>His Friend&s;hip is not to be bought, or &s;old:</L>
<L>Fierce Oppo&s;ition he, unmov'd, &s;hall face;</L>
<L>Mode&s;t in Favour, daring in Di&s;grace;</L>
<L>To &s;hare thy adver&s;e Fate, alone pretend;</L>
<L>In Power, a Servant; out of Power, a Friend.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="9">
Here pour thy Favours in an ample Flood,</L>
<L>Indulge thy boundle&s;s Thir&s;t of doing Good:</L>
<L>Nor think that Good to him alone confin'd;</L>
<L>Such to oblige, is to oblige Mankind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If thus thy mighty Ma&s;ter's Steps thou trace,</L>
<L>The Brave to cheri&s;h, and the Good to grace;</L>
<L>Long &s;halt thou &s;tand from Rage and Faction free,</L>
<L>And teach us long to love the King, thro' Thee.</L>
<L>Or, fall a Victim dangerous to the Foe,</L>
<L>And make him tremble, when he &s;trikes the Blow;</L>
<L>While Honour, Gratitude, Affection join</L>
<L>To deck thy Clo&s;e, and brighten thy Decline;</L>
<L>(Illu&s;trious Doom!) the Great when thus di&s;plac'd,</L>
<L>With Friend&s;hip guarded, and with Virtue grac'd,</L>
<L>In awful Ruin like <HI>Rome</HI>'s Senate fall,</L>
<L>The Prey, and Wor&s;hip of the wondering <HI>Gaul.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No doubt, to Genius &s;ome Reward is due,</L>
<L>(Excluding that were &s;atyrizing You;)</L>
<L>But yet, believe thy unde&s;igning Friend,</L>
<L>When Truth and Genius for thy Choice contend,</L>
<L>Tho' both have Weight, when in the Balance ca&s;t,</L>
<L>Let Probity be fir&s;t, and Parts the la&s;t.</L>

<PB N="11" REF="10">
<L>On the&s;e Foundations if thou dur&s;t be great,</L>
<L>And check the Growth of Folly, and Deceit;</L>
<L>When Party Rage &s;hall droop thro' Length of Days,</L>
<L>And Calumny be ripened into Prai&s;e;</L>
