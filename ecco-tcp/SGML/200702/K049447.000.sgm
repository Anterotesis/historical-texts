<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on the <HI>Fifth Article of the Treaty of UNION,</HI> humbly offered to the Con&s;ideration of the Parliament, relat|ing to <HI>Foreign Ships.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Matter of Difficulty upon this Head, I take to be as follows. &mdash; By the Article, all Ships, any of who&s;e Owners were Foreigners at the Signing of the Treaty, &s;hall be Deem'd &s;till Fo|reign Bottoms within the Terms of the Act of Na|vigation.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of this is plain, Mo&s;t of the Ship|ping employ'd on the South-Ea&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> are Fo|reign Bottoms, and &s;everals of them own'd by Fo|reigners, principally <HI>Dutch.</HI> Now, as <HI>England</HI> is very careful to Encourage her own Shipping; and as <HI>Britain</HI> will after the Union &s;till be &s;o the Encrea&s;e, Employment and Building of Ships be|ing one of the Principal Foundations of her Wealth. &mdash; It would be hard to admit any Ships, which are Foreign built, to be free Ships in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when none that are &s;o in <HI>England</HI> can be admitted.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> freely admits all Ships built in <HI>Scotland</HI> to
<PB N="2" REF="2">
be free in all the Ports and Trade of <HI>Britain;</HI> &mdash; Nay, to go further, <HI>England</HI> allows by the Union, even <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, if bought by <HI>Scots</HI> Men, and belong|ing to <HI>Scots</HI> Owners, to be free, which is more than any <HI>Engli&s;h-man</HI> can be allow'd. &mdash; Nay, If a Fo|reign built Ship lay now at <HI>Leith</HI> Road, and her Owners were all <HI>Engli&s;h-men,</HI> &s;he would not be Deem'd a free Ship by the Union, but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Owners would loo&s;e the benefit of employing her; and the Rea&s;on of this is, to Encourage our own Shipping, on which &s;o much depends, and this Bene|fit will be plainly <HI>Scotland's</HI> at la&s;t.</P>
<P>But the Objection here, is, We have a great many Ships in our Trade that are Foreign built, and that are chiefly own'd by <HI>Scots-men,</HI> but perhaps may have one or more Owners abroad; and it would be hard that the&s;e <HI>Scots-men</HI> &s;hould lo&s;e the Benefit of their Ships which they employ in the Trade of their Native Country, only becau&s;e they have &s;ome <HI>Dutch-men</HI> concerned with them, &mdash; when at the &s;ame time 'tis plain, that if the&s;e <HI>Dutch-men</HI> were not concerned, the Trade of <HI>Scotland</HI> would with great difficulty be carried on.</P>
<P>The Expedient propo&s;ed for this, as I meet with it, is, That a rea&s;onable time &s;hould be given for the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> to buy out their <HI>Dutch</HI> Owners or &s;ell their own Intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y">
Or that it &s;hould have been &s;aid, All Ships &amp;c. who&s;e Owners were <HI>Scots-men,</HI> at the End, or Ratifi|cation of the Treaty, &amp;c. &s;ince till the Treaty is Con|cluded, every <HI>Scots-man</HI> has a Right to employ any Ship whatever.</P>
<P>To An&s;wer this, I crave leave to &s;ay, That this tho plau&s;ible in its &s;elf, has yet Inconveniencies of a nature Intolerable, becau&s;e by this, any Man in <HI>England,</HI> as well as in <HI>Scotland,</HI> may in the name of <HI>Scot&s;men,</HI> Buy what number of Ships in <HI>Holland</HI> they plea&s;e, and at the end of the Union, they become free Ships, to the general Ruine of the Shipping in the whole I&s;land.</P>
<P>And this was Remarkably true, to <HI>England</HI>'s pro|digious Lo&s;s, when in the la&s;t <HI>Dutch</HI> War, the Ships taken from <HI>Holland</HI> as Prize, were made free, the People bought <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, cau&s;ed &s;ham Privateers to take them, and for &s;everal years, &s;ome hundereds of them were Imployed in their Coal Trade, to the Ruine of the Town of <HI>Ip&s;wick,</HI> where all the large Coal Ships u&s;ed to be Built, &mdash; which Lo&s;s that Town never recovered.</P>
<P>To give a time therefore, to have all Ships Own'd by <HI>Scot&s;men</HI> come in to be free, is to open a Door to a Mi&s;chief, which it cannot be de&s;ired, <HI>England</HI> &s;hould &s;uffer in Trade; and the value now &s;uppo&s;ed to be Toucht here, is but very &s;mall.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">
All that I can &s;ee in this, is, That a <HI>Medium</HI> be found out, which if it mu&s;t be, tho I do not grant that nece&s;&s;ity neither, <HI>is this,</HI> That <HI>at the time of the Treaty,</HI> the MAJOR PART of &s;uch Ve&s;&s;el did belong to the Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I confe&s;s this &s;eems to have &s;ome colour of Rea&s;on in it, that the Majority &s;hould Denominate the whole, and I would hope <HI>England</HI> would not Di&s;pute it, &s;ince they do not deny any Foreigners, Holding or Owning any Share of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, but the Legitimacy of the Ve&s;&s;el con&s;i&s;ts in her Bottom.</P>
<P>Now if the Majority of Owners as to the Value, I mean, were not <HI>Scots,</HI> no Ship can be accounted Legitimate. If a <HI>Scots</HI> Merchant Owns &frac38; of a Ship, and a <HI>Dutchman</HI> &frac58; &s;he cannot be accounted in Rea&s;on, any thing but a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, e&s;pecially when her Bottom is <HI>Dutch</HI> too, for the Denomination mu&s;t go with the Major; and it's not the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant is a part Owner of the <HI>Scot&s;man</HI>'s Ship, but the <HI>Scot&s;|man</HI> is a part Owner of the <HI>Dutchman</HI>'s Ship.</P>
<P>This &s;mall <HI>Medium,</HI> I think, will reduce this Ar|ticle to a Square, and an Explanatorie Clau&s;e to that purpo&s;e, will in two Lines determine that Point.</P>
<CLOSER>All which is Humbly Remitted to the Con&s;iderati|on of the Right Honourable the E&s;tates of Par|liament.</CLOSER>
