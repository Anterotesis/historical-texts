<HEAD>DIALOGUE I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_CYNTHIO, Eugenius</HI> and <HI>Philander</HI> had retired together from the town to a country village, that lies upon the <HI>Thames.</HI> Their de&s;ign was to pa&s;s away the heats of the Summer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mong the fre&s;h breezes, that ri&s;e from the river, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the agreeable mixture of &s;hades and fountains, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which the whole country naturally abounds, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey were all three very well ver&s;ed in the po|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er parts of learning, and had travelled into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;t refined nations of <HI>Europe</HI>: &s;o that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere capable of entertaining them&s;elves on a

thou&s;and different &s;ubjects without running into the common topics of defaming publick parties, or particular per&s;ons. As they were intimate friends they took the freedom to di&s;&s;ent from one another in di&s;cour&s;e, or upon occa&s;ion to &s;peak a <HI>Latin</HI> &s;entence without fearing the imputation of pedantry or ill-breeding.</P>
<P>They were one evening taking a walk together in the fields when their di&s;cour&s;e accidentally fell upon &s;everal unprofitable parts of learning. It was <HI>Cynthio</HI>'s humour to run down every thing that was rather for o&s;tentation than u&s;e. He was &s;till preferring good &s;en&s;e to arts and &s;ciences, and often took a plea&s;ure to appear ignorant, that he might the better turn to ridicule tho&s;e that valued them&s;elves on their books and &s;tudies, though at the &s;ame time one might very well &s;ee that he could not have attacked many parts of learning &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, had not he borrowed his a&s;&s;i&s;tances from them. After having rally'd a &s;et or two of <HI>Virtuo&s;o's,</HI> he fell upon the Me|dalli&s;ts.</P>
<P>The&s;e gentlemen, &s;ays he, value them&s;elves upon being critics in Ru&s;t, and will undertake to tell you the different ages of it, by its colour. They are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a kind of learned avarice, and are for getting together hoards of &s;uch mony only as was current among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>La|tins.</HI> There are &s;everal of them that are better acquainted with the faces of the <HI>Antonines,</HI> than of the <HI>Stuarts,</HI> and would rather chu&s;e to count out a Sum in Se&s;terces, than in pounds &s;terling, I have heard of one in <HI>Italy</HI> that u&s;ed to &s;wear <HI>by the head of Otho.</HI> Nothing can be plea&s;anter than to &s;ee a circle of the&s;e <HI>Virtuo&s;o's</HI> about a cabinet
<PB N="11" REF="7">
of Medals, de&s;canting upon the value, rarity and authenticalne&s;s of the &s;everal pieces that lie before them. One takes up a coin of gold, and after having well weighed the figures and in&s;cription, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ells you very gravely, if it were bra&s;s, it would be invaluable. Another falls a ringing a <HI>Pe&s;cen|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ius Niger,</HI> and judiciou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hes the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound of it to be modern. A third de&s;ires you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o ob&s;erve well the <HI>Toga</HI> on &s;uch a rever&s;e, and asks you whether you can in con&s;cience believe the &s;leeve of it to be of the true <HI>Roman</HI> cut.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> the knowledge of Medals has mo&s;t of tho&s;e di&s;advantages that can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ender a &s;cience ridiculous, to &s;uch as are not well ver&s;ed in it. Nothing is more ea&s;y than to repre&s;ent as impertinences any parts of learning that have no immediate relation to the happine&s;s or convenience of mankind. When a man &s;pends his whole life among the Stars and Planets, or lays out a twelve-month on the &s;pots in the Sun, however noble his &s;peculations may be, they are very apt to fall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto burle&s;que. But it is &s;till more natural to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">augh at &s;uch &s;tudies as are employed on low and vulgar objects. What curious ob&s;ervations have been made on Spiders, Lob&s;ters, and Cockle|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hells? yet the very naming of them is almo&s;t &s;uf|ficient to turn them into raillery. It is no won|der therefore that the &s;cience of Medals, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s charged with &s;o many unconcerning parts of knowledge, and built on &s;uch mean materials, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould appear ridiculous to tho&s;e that have not ta|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en the pains to examine it.</P>
<P><HI>Eugenius</HI> was very attentive to what <HI>Philander</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid on the &s;ubject of Medals. He was one that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndeavoured rather to be agreeable than &s;hining

in conver&s;ation, for which rea&s;on he was more beloved, though not &s;o much admired as <HI>Cynthio.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;ays he, I find my &s;elf very much inclined to &s;peak again&s;t a &s;ort of &s;tudy that I know nothing of. I have however one &s;trong Prejudice in favour of it, that <HI>Philander</HI> has thought it worth his while to employ &s;ome time upon it. I am glad then, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> that I have thrown him on a &s;cience of which I have long wi&s;hed to hear the U&s;efulne&s;s. There, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> you mu&s;t excu&s;e me. At pre&s;ent you do not know but it may have its u&s;efulne&s;s. But &s;hould I endeavour to convince you of it, I might fail in my attempt, and &s;o render my &s;ci|ence &s;till more contemptible. On the contrary, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> we are already &s;o per&s;uaded of the unprofitablene&s;s of your &s;cience, that you can but leave us where you find us, but if you &s;ucceed you increa&s;e the number of your party. Well, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> in hopes of making two &s;uch con&s;iderable pro&s;elytes, I am very well content to talk away an evening with you on the &s;ubject; but on this condition, that you will communicate your thoughts to me freely when you di&s;&s;ent from me, or have any difficulties that you think me capable of removing. To make u&s;e of the li|berty you give us, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> I mu&s;t tell you what I believe &s;urprizes all beginners as well as my &s;elf. We are apt to think your Medalli&s;ts a little fanta&s;tical in the different prices they &s;et upon their coins, without any regard to the an|cient value or the metal of which they are com|po&s;ed. A &s;ilver Medal, for example, &s;hall be more e&s;teemed than a golden one, and a piece of bra&s;s than either. To an&s;wer you, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> it
<PB N="13" REF="9">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he language of a Medalli&s;t, you are not to look upon a cabinet of Medals as a trea&s;ure of mony, but of knowledge, nor mu&s;t you fancy any charms in gold, but in the figures and in&s;criptions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at adorn it. The intrin&s;ic value of an old coin does not con&s;i&s;t in its metal but its erudition. It is the Device that has rai&s;ed the &s;pecies, &s;o that at pre&s;ent an <HI>As</HI> or an <HI>Obolus</HI> may carry a higher price than a <HI>Denarius</HI> or a <HI>Drachma</HI>; and a piece of mony that was not worth a peny fif|teen hundred years ago, may be now rated at fifty crowns, or perhaps a hundred guineas. I find, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> that to have a reli&s;h for anci|ent coins it is nece&s;&s;ary to have a contempt of the modern. But I am afraid you will never be able, with all your Medallic eloquence, to per|&s;uade <HI>Eugenius</HI> and my &s;elf that it is better to have a pocket full of <HI>Otho's</HI> and <HI>Gordians</HI> than of <HI>Jaco|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us's</HI> or <HI>Louis d'ors.</HI> This however we &s;hall be judges of, when you have let us know the &s;everal u&s;es of old coins.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and mo&s;t obvious one, &s;ays <HI>Philan|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r,</HI> is the &s;hewing us the Faces of all the great per&s;ons of antiquity. A cabinet of Medals is a collection of pictures in miniature. <HI>Juvenal</HI> calls them very humorou&s;ly,

thoughts the face of a great Man with the chara|cter that authors have given us of him, and to try if we can find out in his looks and features either the haughty, cruel, or merciful temper that di&s;covers it &s;elf in the hi&s;tory of his actions. We find too on Medals the repre&s;entations of Ladies that have given occa&s;ion to whole volumes on the account only of a face. We have here the plea&s;ure to ex|amine their looks and dre&s;&s;es, and to &s;urvey at lei&s;ure tho&s;e beauties that have &s;ometimes been the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of whole kingdoms: Nor do you only meet the faces of &s;uch as are famous in hi&s;tory, but of &s;everal who&s;e names are not to be found any where except on Medals. Some of the Emperors, for example, have had Wives, and &s;ome of them Children, that no authors have mentioned. We are therefore obliged to the &s;tudy of coins for having made new di&s;coveries to the learned, and given them information of &s;uch per&s;ons as are to be met with on no other kind of records. You mu&s;t give me leave, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> to reject this la&s;t u&s;e of Medals. I do not think it worth while to trouble my &s;elf with a per&s;on's name or face that receives all his repu|tation from the mint, and would never have been known in the world had there not been &s;uch things as Medals. A man's memory finds &s;uf|ficient employment on &s;uch as have really &s;igna|lized them&s;elves by their great actions, without charging it &s;elf with the names of an in&s;ignificant people who&s;e whole hi&s;tory is written on the edges of an old coin.</P>
<P>If you are only for &s;uch per&s;ons as have made a noi&s;e in the world, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> you have on Medals a long li&s;t of heathen Deities, di&s;tingui&s;h|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d
<PB N="15" REF="11">
from each other by their proper titles and or|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aments. You &s;ee the copies of &s;everal &s;tatues that have had the polite&s;t nations of the world f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll down before them. You have here too &s;eve|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l per&s;ons of a more thin and &s;hadowy nature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Hope, Con&s;tancy, Fidelity, Abundance, Ho|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our, Virtue, Eternity, Ju&s;tice, Moderation, Hap|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine&s;s, and in &s;hort a whole creation of the like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">maginary &s;ub&s;tances. To the&s;e you may add the Genies of nations, provinces, cities, high-ways, and the like Allegorical Beings. In devices of this nature one &s;ees a pretty poetical invention, and may often find as much thought on the re|ver&s;e of a Medal as in a Canto of <HI>Spen&s;er.</HI> Not to interrupt you, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> I fancy it is this u&s;e of Medals that has recommended them to &s;e|veral hi&s;tory-painters, who perhaps without this a&s;&s;i&s;tance would have found it very difficult to have invented &s;uch an airy &s;pecies of beings, when they are obliged to put a moral virtue into co|lours, or to find out a proper dre&s;s for a pa&s;&s;ion. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is doubtle&s;s for this rea&s;on, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> that Painters have not a little contributed to bring the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">udy of Medals in vogue. For not to mention &s;everal others, <HI>Caraccio</HI> is &s;aid to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted <HI>A|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etine</HI> by de&s;igns that he took from the <HI>Spintriae</HI> of <HI>Tiberius. Raphael</HI> had thoroughly &s;tudied the figures on old Coins. <HI>Patin</HI> tells us that <HI>Lo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">run</HI> had done the &s;ame. And it is well known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at <HI>Rubens</HI> had a noble collection of Medals in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wn po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But I mu&s;t not quit this head <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">efore I tell you, that you &s;ee on Medals not on|ly the names and per&s;ons of Emperors, Kings, con&s;uls, Pro-con&s;uls, Praetors, and the like cha|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acters of importance, but of &s;ome of the Poets,
<PB N="16" REF="12">
and of &s;everal who had won the prizes at the Olympic games. It was a noble time, &s;ays <HI>Cyn|thio,</HI> when Trips and <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> hugs could make a man immortal. How many Heroes would <HI>Moor-fields</HI> have furni&s;hed out in the days of old? A fellow that can now only win a hat or a belt, had he lived among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> might have had his face &s;tampt upon their Coins. But the&s;e were the wi&s;e ancients, who had more e&s;teem for a <HI>Milo</HI> than a <HI>Homer,</HI> and heapt up greater Honours on <HI>Pindar</HI>'s Jockies, than on the Poet him&s;elf. But by this time I &s;uppo&s;e you have drawn up all your medallic people, and indeed they make a much more formidable body than I could have imagined. You have &s;hewn us all conditions, &s;exes and ages, emperors and empre&s;&s;es, men and children, gods and wre&s;tlers. Nay you have con|jured up per&s;ons that exi&s;t no where el&s;e but on old Coins, and have made our Pa&s;&s;ions and Vir|tues and Vices vi&s;ible. I could never have thought that a cabinet of Medals had been &s;o well peopled. But in the next place, &s;ays <HI>Phi|lander,</HI> as we &s;ee on coins the different Faces of per&s;ons, we &s;ee on them too their different Ha|bits and Dre&s;&s;es, according to the mode that pre|vailed in the &s;everal ages when the Medals were &s;tampt. This is another u&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> that in my opinion contributes rather to make a man learned than wi&s;e, and is neither capable of plea|&s;ing the under&s;tanding or imagination. I know there are &s;everal &s;upercilious Critics that will treat an author with the greate&s;t contempt imagi|nable, if he fancies the old <HI>Romans</HI> wore a girdle, and are amazed at a man's ignorance, who be|lieves the <HI>Toga</HI> had any Sleeves to it till the de|clen&s;ion
<PB N="17" REF="13">
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire.

You will find it very difficult, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> to per&s;uade tho&s;e &s;oci|eties of learned men to fall in with your project. They will tell you that things of this importance mu&s;t not be taken on tru&s;t; you ought to learn them among the Cla&s;&s;ic Authors and at the foun|tain-head.

In the mean time, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> you find on Medals every thing that you could meet with in your magazine of antiquities, and when you have built your ar&s;e|nals, wardrobes, and &s;acri&s;ties, it is from Medals that you mu&s;t fetch their furniture. It is here too that you &s;ee the figures of &s;everal in&s;truments of mu&s;ick, mathematics and mechanics. One might make an entire gally out of the plans that are to be met with on the rever&s;es of &s;everal old coins. Nor are they only charged with Things but with many ancient Cu&s;toms, as &s;acrifices, tri|umphs, congiaries, allocutions, decur&s;ions, lecti|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erniums, and a thou&s;and other antiquated names <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d ceremonies that we &s;hould not have had &s;o j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t a notion of, were they not &s;till pre&s;erved on Coins. I might add under this head of antiqui|ties, that we find on Medals the manner of &s;pel|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng in the old <HI>Roman</HI> in&s;criptions. That is, &s;ays
<PB N="20" REF="16">
<HI>Cynthio,</HI> we find that <HI>Felix</HI> is never written with an <HI>oe</HI> dipthongue, and that in <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s days <HI>Civis</HI> &s;tood for <HI>Cives,</HI> with other &s;ecrets in Or|thography of the &s;ame importance.</P>
<P>To come then to a more weighty u&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> it is certain that Medals give a very great light to hi&s;tory, in confirming &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as are true in old Authors, in &s;ettling &s;uch as are told after different manners, and in recording &s;uch as have been omitted. In this ca&s;e a cabinet of Medals is a body of hi&s;tory. It was indeed the be&s;t way in the world to perpetuate the me|mory of great actions, thus to coin out the life of an Emperor, and to put every great exploit in|to the mint. It was a kind of Printing, before the art was invented. It is by this means that Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Vaillant</HI> has di&s;embroiled a hi&s;tory that was lo&s;t to the world before his time, and out of a &s;hort collection of Medals has given us a chroni|cle of the Kings of <HI>Syria.</HI> For this too is an ad|vantage Medals have over books, that they tell their &s;tory much quicker, and &s;um up a whole volume in twenty or thirty rever&s;es. They are indeed the be&s;t epitomes in the world, and let you &s;ee with one ca&s;t of an eye the &s;ub&s;tance of above a hundred pages. Another u&s;e of Medals is, that they not only &s;hew you the actions of an Emperor, but at the &s;ame time mark out the year in which they were performed. Every exploit has its date &s;et to it. A &s;eries of an Emperor's Coins is his life dige&s;ted into annals. Hi&s;torians &s;eldom break their relation with a mixture of chronology, nor di&s;tribute the particulars of an Emperor's &s;tory into the &s;everal years of his reign: or where they do it they often differ in their &s;eve|ral
<PB N="21" REF="17">
periods. Here therefore it is much &s;afer to quote a Medal than an Author, for in this ca&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou do not appeal to a <HI>Suetonius</HI> or a <HI>Lampri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ius,</HI> but to the Emperor him&s;elf, or to the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ody of a <HI>Roman</HI> Senate. Be&s;ides that a Coin is in no danger of having its characters altered by copiers and tran&s;cribers. This I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> may in &s;ome ca&s;es be of great moment, but con&s;idering the &s;ubjects on which your chro|nologers are generally employed, I &s;ee but little u&s;e that ri&s;es from it. For example, what &s;igni|fies it to the world whether &s;uch an Elephant ap|peared in the Amphi-theatre in the &s;econd or the third year of <HI>Domitian?</HI> Or what am I the wi&s;er for knowing that <HI>Trajan</HI> was in the fifth year of his Tribune&s;hip when he entertained the people with &s;uch a Hor&s;e-race or Bull-baiting? Yet it is the fixing of the&s;e great periods that gives a man the fir&s;t rank in the republic of letters, and re|commends him to the world for a per&s;on of va|rious reading and profound erudition.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t always give your men of great reading leave to &s;how their talents on the meane&s;t &s;ubjects, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius</HI>; it is a kind of &s;hooting at rovers: where a man lets fly his arrow without taking any aim, to &s;hew his &s;trength. But there is one advantage, &s;ays he, turning to <HI>Philander,</HI> that &s;eems to me very con&s;iderable, although your Medalli&s;ts &s;el|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om throw it into the account, which is the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lp to memory one finds in Medals: for my own part I am very much embarra&s;&s;ed in the names and ranks of the &s;everal <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, and find it difficult to recollect upon occa&s;ion the different parts of their hi&s;tory: but your Medal|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ts upon the fir&s;t naming of an Emperor will

immediately tell you his age, family and life. To remember where he enters in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, they only con&s;ider in what part of the cabinet he lies; and by runinng over in their thoughts &s;uch a par|ticular drawer, will give you an account of all the remarkable parts of his reign.</P>
<P>I thank you, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> for helping me to an u&s;e that perhaps I &s;hould not have thought on. But there is another of which I am &s;ure you could not be but &s;en&s;ible when you were at <HI>Rome.</HI> I mu&s;t own to you it &s;urprized me to &s;ee my <HI>Ci|ceroni</HI> &s;o well acquainted with the bu&s;ts and &s;ta|tues of all the great people of antiquity. There was not an Emperor or Empre&s;s but he knew by &s;ight, and as he was &s;eldom without Medals in his pocket, he would often &s;hew us the &s;ame face on an old Coin that we &s;aw in the Statue. He would di&s;cover a <HI>Commodus</HI> through the di&s;gui&s;e of the club and lion's skin, and find out &s;uch a one to be <HI>Livia</HI> that was dre&s;&s;ed up like a <HI>Ceres.</HI> Let a bu&s;t be never &s;o di&s;figured, they have a thou&s;and marks by which to decipher it. They will know a <HI>Zenobia</HI> by the &s;itting of her Dia|dem, and will di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>Fau&s;tina's</HI> by their different way of tying up their hair. Oh! Sir, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> they will go a great deal farther, they will give you the name and titles of a Sta|tue that has lo&s;t his no&s;e and ears; or if there is but half a beard remaining, will tell you at fir&s;t &s;ight who was the owner of it. Now I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s to you, I u&s;ed to fancy they impo&s;ed upon me an Emperor or Empre&s;s at plea&s;ure, rather than appear ignorant.</P>
<P>All this however is ea&s;ily learnt from Medals, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> where you may &s;ee likewi&s;e the

<P>The &s;ame kind of fancy, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> has formerly gained upon &s;everal of your Medalli&s;ts, who were for hoording up &s;uch pieces of money only as had been half con&s;umed by time or ru&s;t. There were no Coins plea&s;ed them more than tho&s;e which had pa&s;&s;ed through the hands of an old <HI>Roman</HI> Clipper.

I fancy, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> there is nothing more ridicu|lous than an Antiquary's reading the <HI>Greek</HI> or

<HI>Latin</HI> Poets. He never thinks of the beauty of the thought or language, but is for &s;earching in|to what he calls the Erudition of the Author.

It is indeed odd enough to con&s;ider how all kinds of Readers find their account in the old Poets. Not only your men of the more refined or &s;olid parts of Learning, but even your Alchymi&s;t and Fortune-teller will di&s;cover the &s;ecrets of their art in <HI>Ho|mer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI> This, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> is a pre|judice of a very ancient &s;tanding.

One would be amazed to &s;ee what pains he takes to prove that <HI>Homer</HI> under&s;tood all the figures in Rhetoric, before they were invented.

But to fini&s;h the task you have &s;et me, we may ob&s;erve that not only the Virtues, and the like imaginary per&s;ons, but all the heathen Divinities appear generally in the &s;ame Dre&s;s among the Po|ets that they wear in Medals. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I believe both the one and the other took the Mode from the ancient <HI>Greek</HI> Statuaries. It will not perhaps be an improper tran&s;ition to pa&s;s from the heathen gods to the &s;everal mon&s;ters of antiquity,
<PB N="33" REF="29">
as <HI>Chimaeras, Gorgons, Sphinxes,</HI> and many others that make the &s;ame figure in ver&s;e as on coins.

<P>I wonder, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> that your Medalli&s;ts have not been as diligent in &s;earching the Poets as the Hi&s;torians, &s;ince I find they are &s;o capable of enlightning their art. I would have &s;ome bo|dy put the Mu&s;es under a kind of contribution to furni&s;h out whatever they have in them that bears any relation to Coins. Though they taught us but the &s;ame things that might be learnt in other writings, they would at lea&s;t teach us more agreeably, and draw &s;everal over to the &s;tudy of Medals that would rather be in&s;tructed in ver&s;e than in pro&s;e.

I am apt to think <HI>Virgil</HI> had a further view in this reque&s;t of <HI>Juno</HI> than what his Commenta|tors have di&s;covered in it.

He knew too that a main objection to this &s;tory was the great difference of Cu&s;toms, Language and Habits among the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Trojans.</HI> To obviate therefore &s;o &s;trong an objection, he makes this difference to ari&s;e from the foreca&s;t and prae|determination of the Gods them&s;elves.

After having thus far cleared our way to the Me|dal, I take the thought of the rever&s;e to be this. The &s;tranded ve&s;&s;el is the Commonwealth of <HI>Rome,</HI> that by the tyranny of <HI>Domitian,</HI> and the in&s;olence of the <HI>Praetorian</HI> Guards under <HI>Nerva,</HI> was quite run aground and in danger of peri&s;h|ing. Some of tho&s;e embarked in it endeavour at her recovery, but it is <HI>Trajan</HI> that by the adoption of <HI>Nerva</HI> &s;tems the tide to her relief, and like another <HI>Neptune</HI> &s;hoves her off the quick|&s;ands. Your Device, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> hangs very well together; but is not it liable to the &s;ame ex|ceptions that you made us la&s;t night to &s;uch expli|cations as have nothing but the writer's imagina|tion to &s;upport them? To &s;hew you, &s;ays <HI>Phi|lander,</HI> that the con&s;truction I put on this Medal is conformable to the fancies of the old <HI>Romans,</HI> you may ob&s;erve, that <HI>Horace</HI> repre&s;ents at length the Commonwealth of <HI>Rome</HI> under the figure of a &s;hip, in the Allegory that you meet with in the fourteenth Ode of his fir&s;t book.

not been explained by others, as many of them have been explained in a different manner. There are indeed others that have had very near the &s;ame explication put upon them, but as this explication has been &s;upported by no authority, it can at be&s;t be looked upon but as a probable conjecture. It is certain, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> there cannot be any more authentic illu&s;trations of <HI>Roman</HI> Medals, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that are full of fancy, than &s;uch as are drawn out of the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets. For as there is a great affinity between De&s;igning and Poetry, &s;o the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets, and the De&s;igners of the <HI>Roman</HI> Medals, lived very near one ano|ther, were acquainted with the &s;ame cu&s;toms, conver&s;ant with the &s;ame objects, and bred up to the &s;ame reli&s;h for wit and fancy. But who are the Ladies that we are next to examine? The&s;e are, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> &s;o many Cities, Nations and Provinces that pre&s;ent them&s;elves to you under the &s;hape of women.

<P>You have given us &s;ome quotations out of <HI>Per&s;ius</HI> this morning, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> that in my opinion have a great deal of poetry in them. I have often wondered at Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> for pa&s;&s;ing &s;o &s;evere a cen&s;ure on this Author. He fancies the de&s;cription of a Wreck that you have already ci|ted, is too good for <HI>Per&s;ius,</HI> and that he might be helpt in it by <HI>Lucan,</HI> who was one of his contemporaries. For my part, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> I am &s;o far from Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s opinion in this particu|lar, that I fancy <HI>Per&s;ius</HI> a better Poet than <HI>Lucan</HI>: and that had he been engaged on the &s;ame &s;ub|ject, he would at lea&s;t in his Expre&s;&s;ions and De|&s;criptions have out-writ the <HI>Phar&s;alia.</HI> He was indeed employed on &s;ubjects that &s;eldom led him into any thing like De&s;cription, but where he has an occa&s;ion of &s;hewing him&s;elf, we find very few of the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets that have given a grea|ter beauty to their Expre&s;&s;ions. His ob&s;curities are indeed &s;ometimes affected, but they generally ari&s;e from the remotene&s;s of the Cu&s;toms, Per|&s;ons and Things he alludes to: as Satyr is for this rea&s;on more difficult to be under&s;tood by tho&s;e that are not of the &s;ame Age with it, than any other kind of Poetry. Love-ver&s;es and
<PB N="142" REF="138">
Heroics deal in Images that are ever fixed and &s;ettled in the nature of things, but a thou&s;and ideas enter into Satyr, that are as changeable and un&s;teady as the mode or the humours of mankind.</P>
<P>Our three friends had pa&s;&s;ed away the whole morning among their Medals and <HI>Latin</HI> Poets. <HI>Philander</HI> told them it was now too late to enter on another Series, but if they would take up with &s;uch a dinner as he could meet with at his Lodgings, he would afterwards lay the re&s;t of his Medals before them. <HI>Cynthio</HI> and <HI>Euge|nius</HI> were both of them &s;o well plea&s;ed with the novelty of the &s;ubject, that they would not refu&s;e the offer <HI>Philander</HI> made them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A PARALLEL between the Ancient and Modern MEDALS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PHILANDER</HI> u&s;ed every morning to take a walk in a neighbouring wood, that &s;tood on the borders of the <HI>Thames.</HI> It was cut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hrough by abundance of beautiful allies, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erminating on the water, looked like &s;o many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ainted views in per&s;pective. The banks of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iver and the thickne&s;s of the &s;hades drew into them all the birds of the country, that at Sun-ri|&s;ing filled the wood with &s;uch a variety of notes, as made the prettie&s;t confu&s;ion imaginable. I know in de&s;criptions of this nature the &s;cenes are generally &s;uppo&s;ed to grow out of the Au|thor's imagination, and if they are not charming in all their parts, the Reader never imputes it to the want of &s;un or &s;oil, but to the Writer's bar|renne&s;s of invention. It is <HI>Cicero</HI>'s ob&s;ervation on the Plane-tree, that makes &s;o flouri&s;hing a fi|gure in one of <HI>Plato</HI>'s Dialogues, that it did not
<PB N="144" REF="140">
draw its nouri&s;hment from the fountain that ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by it and watered its roots, but from the rich|ne&s;s of the &s;tyle that de&s;cribes it. For my own part, as I de&s;ign only to fix the &s;cene of the fol|lowing Dialogue, I &s;hall not endeavour to give it any other ornaments than tho&s;e which nature has be&s;towed upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Philander</HI> was here enjoying the cool of the morning, among the dews that lay on every thing about him, and that gave the air &s;uch a fre&s;hne&s;s as is not a little agreeable in the hot part of the year. He not been here long before he was joined by <HI>Cynthio</HI> and <HI>Eugenius. Cyn|thio</HI> immediately fell upon <HI>Philander</HI> for breaking his night's re&s;t. You have &s;o filled my head, &s;ays he, with old Coins, that I have had nothing but figures and in&s;criptions before my eyes. If I chanced to fall into a little &s;lumber, it was im|mediately interrupted with the vi&s;ion of a <HI>Cadu|ceus</HI> or a <HI>Cornu-copiae.</HI> You will make me be|lieve, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> that you begin to be recon|ciled to Medals. They &s;ay it is a &s;ure &s;ign a man loves money, when he is u&s;ed to find it in his dreams. There is certainly, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> &s;omething like Avarice in the &s;tudy of Medals. The more a man knows of them, the more he de&s;ires to know. There is one &s;ubject in par|ticular that <HI>Cynthio,</HI> as well as my &s;elf, has a mind to engage you in. We would fain know how the Ancient and Modern Medals differ from one another, and which of them de&s;erves the preference. You have a mind to engage me in a &s;ubject, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> that is perhaps of a lar|ger extent than you imagine. To examine it thoroughly, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to take them
<PB N="145" REF="141">
in pieces, and to &s;peak of the difference that &s;hews it &s;elf in their Metals, in the Occa&s;ion of &s;tamp|ing them, in the In&s;criptions, and in the Figures that adorn them. Since you have divided your &s;ubject, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> be &s;o kind as to enter on it without any further preface.</P>
<P>We &s;hould fir&s;t of all, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> con&s;ider the difference of the Metals that we find in an|cient and modern Coins, but as this &s;peculation is more curious than improving, I believe you will excu&s;e me if I do not dwell long upon it. One may under&s;tand all the learned part of this &s;cience, without knowing whether there were Coins of iron or lead among the old <HI>Romans,</HI> and if a man is well acquainted with the Device of a Medal, I do not &s;ee what nece&s;&s;ity there is of being able to tell whether the Medal it &s;elf be of copper or <HI>Corinthian</HI> bra&s;s. There is how|ever &s;o great a difference between the antique and modern Medals, that I have &s;een an Antiquary lick an old Coin, among other tryals, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the age of it by its Ta&s;te. I remember when I laught at him for it, he told me with a great deal of vehemence, there was as much dif|ference between the reli&s;h of ancient and modern bra&s;s, as between an apple and a turnep. It is pity, &s;ays <HI>Engenius,</HI> but they found out the Smell too of an ancient Medal. They would then be able to judge of it by all the &s;en&s;es. The Touch, I have heard, gives almo&s;t as good evidence as the Sight, and the Ringing of a Me|dal is, I know, a very common experiment. But I &s;uppo&s;e this la&s;t proof you mention relates only to &s;uch Coins as are made of your ba&s;er &s;orts of metal. And here, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> we may ob|&s;erve
<PB N="146" REF="142">
the prudence of the Ancients above that of the Moderns, in the care they took to perpetuate the memory of great actions. They knew very well that &s;ilver and gold might fall into the hands of the covetous or ignorant, who would not re&s;pect them for the Device they bore, but for the Metal they were made of. Nor were their apprehen&s;ions ill-founded; for it is not ea&s;ily ima|gined how many of the&s;e noble monuments of hi&s;tory have peri&s;hed in the gold&s;miths hands, be|fore they came to be collected together by the learned men of the&s;e two or three la&s;t Centuries. In&s;criptions, Victories, Buildings, and a thou&s;and other pieces of antiquity were melted down in tho&s;e barbarous Ages, that thought figures and letters only &s;erved to &s;poil the gold that was charged with them. Your Medalli&s;ts look on this de&s;truction of Coins, as on the burning of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Library, and would be content to compound for them, with almo&s;t the lo&s;s of a <HI>Vatican.</HI> To prevent this in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the ancients placed the greate&s;t variety of their devi|ces on their bra&s;s and copper Coins, which are in no fear of falling into the clippers hands, nor in any danger of melting till the general confla|gration. On the contrary, our modern Medals are mo&s;t in &s;ilver or gold, and often in a very &s;mall number of each. I have &s;een a golden one at <HI>Vienna,</HI> of <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd, that weighed two and twenty pound, which is probably &s;ingular in its kind, and will not be able to keep it &s;elf long out of the furnace when it leaves the Emperor's Trea&s;ury. I remember another in the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI>'s collection, that has in it three pound weight of gold. The Princes who &s;truck the&s;e
<PB N="147" REF="143">
Medals, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> &s;eem to have de&s;igned them rather as an o&s;tentation of their Wealth, than of their Virtues. They fancied probably, it was a greater honour to appear in gold than in copper, and that a Medal receives all its value from the rarity of the metal. I think the next &s;ubject you propo&s;ed to &s;peak of, were the dif|ferent Occa&s;ions that have given birth to ancient and modern Medals.</P>
<P>Before we enter on this particular, &s;ays <HI>Phi|lander,</HI> I mu&s;t tell you by way of preliminary, that formerly there was no difference between Money and Medals. An old <HI>Roman</HI> had his pur&s;e full of the &s;ame pieces that we now pre|&s;erve in Cabinets. A&s;&s;oon as an Emperor had done any thing remarkable, it was immediately &s;tamped on a Coin, and became current through his whole Dominions. It was a pretty contri|vance, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> to &s;pread abroad the virtues of an Emperor, and make his actions circulate. A fre&s;h Coin was a kind of a <HI>Gazette,</HI> that pub|li&s;hed the late&s;t news of the Empire. I &s;hould fancy your <HI>Roman</HI> Bankers were very good Hi|&s;torians. It is certain, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> they might find their profit and in&s;truction mixed together. I have often wondered that no nation among the moderns has imitated the antient <HI>Romans</HI> in this particular. I know no other way of &s;ecuring the&s;e kinds of monuments, and making them nu|merous enough to be handed down to future ages. But where State&s;men are ruled by a &s;pi|rit of faction and intere&s;t, they can have no pa&s;|&s;ion for the glory of their country, nor any con|cern for the figure it will make among po&s;terity. A man that talks of his nation's honour a thou|&s;and
<PB N="148" REF="144">
years hence, is in very great danger of being laught at. We &s;hall think, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> you have a mind to fall out with the Government, becau&s;e it does not encourage Medals. But were all your ancient Coins that are now in Cabinets once current money? It is the mo&s;t probable opinion, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> that they were all of them &s;uch, excepting tho&s;e we call Meda|lions. The&s;e in re&s;pect of the other Coins were the &s;ame as modern Medals, in re&s;pect of mo|dern money. They were exempted from all commerce, and had no other value but what was &s;et upon them by the fancy of the owner. They are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;truck by Emperors for pre&s;ents to their Friends, foreign Princes, or Amba&s;&s;adors. However, that the &s;mallne&s;s of their number might not endanger the lo&s;s of the devices they bore, the <HI>Romans</HI> took care gene|rally to &s;tamp the &s;ubject of their Medalions on their ordinary Coins that were the running ca&s;h of the nation. As if in <HI>England</HI> we &s;hould &s;ee on our half-penny and farthing pieces, the &s;everal de&s;igns that &s;how them&s;elves in their perfection on our Medals.</P>
<P>If we now con&s;ider, continued <HI>Philander,</HI> the different Occa&s;ions or Subjects of ancient and modern Medals, we &s;hall find they both agree in recording the great actions and &s;ucce&s;&s;es in war, allowing &s;till for the different ways of making it, and the circum&s;tances that attended it in pa&s;t ages, and in the pre&s;ent. I &s;hall in&s;tance one. I do not remember in any old Coin to have &s;een the taking of a town mentioned: as indeed there were few conquerors could &s;ignalize them&s;elves that way before the invention of powder and
<PB N="149" REF="145">
fortifications, a &s;ingle battle often deciding the fate of whole kingdoms. Our modern Medals give us &s;everal &s;ieges and plans of fortified towns, that &s;how them&s;elves in all their parts to a great advantage on the rever&s;e of a Coin. It is indeed, a kind of ju&s;tice, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> that a Prince owes to po&s;terity, after he has ruined or defaced a &s;trong place to deliver down to them a model of it as it &s;tood whole and entire. The Coin re|pairs in &s;ome mea&s;ure the mi&s;chiefs of his Bombs and Cannons. In the next place, &s;ays <HI>Philan|der,</HI> we &s;ee both on the ancient and modern Me|dals the &s;everal noble pieces of Architecture that were fini&s;hed at the time when the Medals were &s;tamped. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve however, to the ho|nour of the latter, that they have repre&s;ented their buildings according to the rules of per&s;pe|ctive. This I remember to have &s;een but in ve|ry few of the plans on ancient Coins, which makes them appear much le&s;s beautiful than the modern, e&s;pecially to a mathematical eye. Thus far our two &s;etts of Medals agree as to their Subject. But old Coins go farther in their compliments to their Emperor, as they take occa&s;ion to celebrate his di&s;tingui&s;hing Virtues; not as they &s;howed them&s;elves in any particular action, but as they &s;hone out in the general view of his character. This humour went &s;o far, that we &s;ee <HI>Nero</HI>'s fid|ling, and <HI>Commodus</HI>'s skill in fencing, on &s;everal of their Medals. At pre&s;ent, you never meet with the King of <HI>France</HI>'s genero&s;ity, nor the Em|peror's devotion recorded after this manner. A|gain, the <HI>Romans</HI> u&s;ed to regi&s;ter the great actions of Peace that turned to the good of the people, as well as tho&s;e of War. The remi&s;&s;ion of a
<PB N="150" REF="146">
Debt, the taking off a Duty, the giving up a Tax, the mending a Port, or the making a Highway, were not looked upon as improper &s;ubjects for a Coin. They were glad of any opportunity to encourage their Emperors in the humour of do|ing good, and knew very well, that many of the&s;e acts of beneficence had a wider and more la&s;ting influence on the happine&s;s and welfare of a peo|ple, than the gaining a Victory, or the Conque&s;t of a nation. In <HI>England</HI> perhaps it would have looked a little odd to have &s;tamped a Medal on the aboli&s;hing of Chimney-money in the la&s;t Reign, or on the giving a hundred thou&s;and pound a year towards the carrying on a war, in this. I find, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> had we &s;truck in with the practice of the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> we &s;hould have had Medals on the fitting up our &s;everal Docks, on the making of our Rivers navigable, on the building our men of War, and the like &s;ubjects, that have certainly very well de&s;erved them. The rea&s;on why it has been neglected, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly be this. Our Princes have the coin|ing of their own Medals, and perhaps may think it would look like vanity to erect &s;o many Tro|phies and Monuments of prai&s;e to their own merit; whereas among the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> the Senate had &s;till a watchful eye on their Emperor, and if they found any thing in his life and actions that might furni&s;h out a Medal, they did not fail of making him &s;o acceptable an offering. 'Tis true, their flatteries betray often &s;uch a ba&s;e|ne&s;s of &s;pirit, as one would little expect to find among &s;uch an order of men. And here by the way we may ob&s;erve, that you never find any thing like Satyr or Raillery on old Coins.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="147">Whatever victories were got on foreign ene|mies, or the &s;everal pretenders to the Empire obtained over one another, they are recorded on Coins without the lea&s;t bitterne&s;s or reflection. The Emperors often je&s;ted on their rivals or predece&s;&s;ors, but their Mints &s;till maintained their gravity. They might publi&s;h invectives again&s;t one another in their di&s;cour&s;es or wri|tings, but never on their Coins. Had we no other hi&s;tories of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, but tho&s;e we find on their money, we &s;hould take them for the mo&s;t virtuous race of Princes that mankind were ever ble&s;&s;ed with: whereas, if we look in|to their lives, they appear many of them &s;uch mon&s;ters of lu&s;t and cruelty, as are almo&s;t a re|proach to human nature. Medals are therefore &s;o many compliments to an Emperor, that a|&s;cribe to him all the Virtues and Victories he him&s;elf pretended to. Were you to take from hence all your informations, you would fancy <HI>Claudius</HI> as great a Conqueror as <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> and <HI>Domitian</HI> a wi&s;er Prince than his brother <HI>Ti|tus. Tiberius</HI> on his Coins is all Mercy and Mo|deration, <HI>Caligula</HI> and <HI>Nero</HI> are Fathers of their Country, <HI>Galba</HI> the patron of public Liberty, and <HI>Vitellius</HI> the re&s;torer of the city of <HI>Rome.</HI> In &s;hort, if you have a mind to &s;ee the religious <HI>Commodus,</HI> the pious <HI>Caracalla,</HI> and the devout <HI>Heliogabalus,</HI> you may find them either in the in&s;cription or device of their Medals. On the contrary, tho&s;e of a modern make are often char|ged with Irony and Satyr. Our Kings no &s;oon|er fall out, but their mints make war upon one another, and their malice appears on their Me|dals. One meets &s;ometimes with very nice
<PB N="152" REF="148">
touches of Raillery, but as we have no in&s;tance of it among the ancient Coins, I &s;hall leave you to determine, whether or no it ought to find a place there. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> I be|lieve we are generally in the wrong, when we deviate from the ancients: becau&s;e their practice is for the mo&s;t part grounded upon rea&s;on. But if our fore-fathers have thought fit to be grave and &s;erious, I hope their po&s;terity may laugh with|out offence. For my part, I cannot but look on this kind of Raillery as a refinement on Me|dals: and do not &s;ee why there may not be &s;ome for diver&s;ion, at the &s;ame time that there are o|thers of a more &s;olemn and maje&s;tic nature, as a Victory may be celebrated in an Epigram as well as in an Heroic Poem. Had the ancients given place to Raillery on any of their Coins, I que&s;tion not but they would have been the mo&s;t valued parts of a collection. Be&s;ides the enter|tainment we &s;hould have found in them, they would have &s;hown us the different &s;tate of Wit, as it flouri&s;hed or decayed in the &s;everal ages of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. There is no doubt, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> but our fore-fathers, if they had plea|&s;ed, could have been as witty as their po&s;terity. But I am of opinion, they indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided it on their Coins, that they might not give us oc|ca&s;ion to &s;u&s;pect their &s;incerity. Had they run into mirth or &s;atyr we &s;hould not have thought they had de&s;igned &s;o much to in&s;truct as to di|vert us. I have heard, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> that the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;tamped &s;everal Coins on the &s;ame occa|&s;ion. If we follow their example, there will be no danger of deceiving po&s;terity: &s;ince the more &s;erious &s;ort of Medals may &s;erve as Comments
<PB N="153" REF="149">
on tho&s;e of a lighter character. However it is, the raillery of the Moderns cannot be wor&s;e than the flattery of the Ancients. But hitherto you have only mentioned &s;uch Coins as were made on the Emperor, I have &s;een &s;everal of our own time that have been made as a compliment to private per&s;ons. There are pieces of money, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> that during the time of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, were coined in honour of the Senate, Army or People. I do not remember to have &s;een in the upper Empire the face of any private per&s;on that was not &s;ome way related to the Im|perial family. <HI>Sejanus</HI> has indeed his Con&s;ul&s;hip mentioned on a Coin of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> as he has the honour to give a name to the year in which our Saviour was crucified. We are now come to the Legend or In&s;cription of our Medals, which as it is one of the more e&s;&s;ential parts of them, it may de&s;erve to be examined more at length. You have cho&s;en a very &s;hort Text to enlarge upon, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio</HI>: I &s;hould as &s;oon expect to &s;ee a Critique on the Po&s;ie of a Ring, as on the In|&s;cription of a Medal.</P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;everal modern Coins, &s;ays <HI>Phi|lander,</HI> that have had part of the Legend running round the edges, like the <HI>Decus et Tutamen</HI> in our milled money; &s;o that a few years will proba|bly wear out the action that the Coin was de|&s;igned to perpetuate. The ancients were too wi&s;e to regi&s;ter their exploits on &s;o nice a &s;ur|face. I &s;hould fancy, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> the mo|derns may have cho&s;en this part of the Medal for the in&s;cription, that the figures on each &s;ide might appear to a greater advantage. I have ob&s;erved in &s;everal old Coins a kind of confu&s;ion between
<PB N="154" REF="150">
the legend and the device. The figures and let|ters were &s;o mingled together, that one would think the Coiner was hard put to it on what part of the money to be&s;tow the &s;everal words of his in&s;cription. You have found out &s;ome|thing like an excu&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> for your milled Medals, if they carried the whole legend on their edges. But at the &s;ame time that they are lettered on the edges, they have other in&s;crip|tions on the face and the rever&s;e. Your modern De&s;igners cannot contract the occa&s;ion of the Medal into an in&s;cription that is proper to the Volume they write upon: &s;o that having &s;crib|bled over both &s;ides, they are forced, as it were to write upon the margin. The fir&s;t fault there|fore that I &s;hall find with a modern legend, is its Diffu&s;ivene&s;s. You have &s;ometimes the whole &s;ide of a Medal over-run with it. One would fancy the Author had a de&s;ign of being <HI>Ciceroni|an</HI> in his <HI>Latin,</HI> and of making a round period I will give you only the rever&s;e of a Coin &s;tampt by the pre&s;ent Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> on the rai|&s;ing of the &s;iege of <HI>Vienna.</HI> VIENNA AVSTRIA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 4/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">4 IVLII AB ACHMETE II.

I remember you repre&s;ented your ancient Coins as abridgements of hi&s;tory; but your modern, if there are many of them like this, &s;hould them&s;elves be epitomized.

What a maje&s;ty and force does one meet with in the&s;e &s;hort In&s;criptions! Are not you amazed to &s;ee &s;o much hi&s;tory gathered into &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s? You have often the &s;ubject of a Vo|lume in a couple of words.</P>
<P>If our modern Medals are &s;o very prolix in their pro&s;e, they are every whit as tedious in their ver&s;e. You have &s;ometimes a dull Epigram of four lines. This, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> may be of great u&s;e to immortalize Punns and Quibbles, and to let po&s;terity &s;ee their forefathers were a parcel of blockheads. A Coin, I find, may be of great u&s;e to a bad Poet. If he cannot become im|mortal by the goodne&s;s of his ver&s;e, he may by the durablene&s;s of the Metal that &s;upports it. I &s;hall give you an in&s;tance, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> from a Medal of <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> that will &s;tand as an eternal monument of Dullne&s;s and Bravery.

<P>It is well, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> you tell us this is a Medal of the Great <HI>Gu&s;tavus:</HI> I &s;hould have ta|ken it for &s;ome one of his <HI>Gothic</HI> Predece&s;&s;ors. Does it not bring into your mind <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great's being accompanied with a <HI>Chaerilus</HI> in his <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> expedition? If you are offended at the homeline&s;s of this In&s;cription, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> what would you think of &s;uch as have neither &s;en&s;e nor grammar in them? I a&s;&s;ure you I have &s;een the face of many a great Monarch hemmed in with fal&s;e <HI>Latin.</HI> But it is not only the &s;tupi|dity and tediou&s;ne&s;s of the&s;e In&s;criptions that I find fault with; &s;uppo&s;ing them of a moderate length and proper &s;en&s;e, why mu&s;t they be in ver&s;e? We &s;hould be &s;urprized to &s;ee the title of a &s;erious book in rhime, yet it is every whit as ri|diculous to give the &s;ubject of a Medal in a piece of an Hexameter. This however is the practice of our modern Medalli&s;ts. If you look into the ancient In&s;criptions, you &s;ee an air of &s;implicity in the words, but a great magnificence in the thought; on the contrary, in your modern Me|dals you have generally a trifling thought wrapt up in the beginning or end of an Heroic ver&s;e. Where the &s;en&s;e of an In&s;cription is low, it is not in the power of <HI>Dactyls</HI> and <HI>Spondees</HI> to rai&s;e it; where it is noble, it has no need of &s;uch af|fected ornaments. I remember a Medal of <HI>Phi|lip</HI> the &s;econd, on <HI>Charles le Quint</HI>'s re&s;igning to him the Kingdom of <HI>Spain,</HI> with this In&s;cription, <HI>Ut Quie&s;cat Atlas.</HI> The Device is a <HI>Hercules</HI> with the Sphere on his &s;houlders. Notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="157" REF="153">
the thought is poetical, I dare &s;ay you would think the beauty of the In&s;cription very much lo&s;t, had it been &mdash; <HI>requie&s;cat ut Atlas.</HI> To in&s;tance a Medal of our own nation. After the conclu&s;ion of the peace with <HI>Holland,</HI> there was one &s;tampt with the following Legend &mdash; <HI>Re|deant Commercia Flandris.</HI> The thought is here great enough, but in my opinion it would have looked much greater in two or three words of pro&s;e. I think truly, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> it is ridiculous enough to make the In&s;cription run like a piece of a ver&s;e, when it is not ta|ken out of an old Author. But I would fain have your opinion on &s;uch In&s;criptions as are borrowed from the <HI>Latin</HI> Poets. I have &s;een &s;everal of this &s;ort that have been very prettily ap|plied, and I fancy when they are cho&s;en with art, they &s;hould not be thought unworthy of a place in your Medals.</P>
<P>Which ever &s;ide I take, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> I am like to have a great party again&s;t me. Tho&s;e who have formed their reli&s;h on old Coins, will by no means allow of &s;uch an innovation; on the contrary, your men of wit will be apt to look on it as an improvement on ancient Medals. You will oblige us however to let us know what kind of rules you would have ob&s;erved in the choice of your quotations, &s;ince you &s;eem to lay a &s;tre&s;s on their being cho&s;en with Art. You mu&s;t know then, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> I do not think it enough that a quotation tells us plain matter of fact, unle&s;s it has &s;ome other accidental orna|ments to &s;et it off. Indeed if a great action that &s;eldom happens in the cour&s;e of human affairs, is exactly de&s;cribed in the pa&s;&s;age of an old Poet, it
<PB N="158" REF="154">
gives the Reader a very agreeable &s;urprize, and may therefore de&s;erve a place on a Medal.</P>
<P>Again, if there is more than a &s;ingle circum|&s;tance of the action &s;pecified in the quotation, it plea&s;es a man to &s;ee an old exploit copied out as it were by a Modern, and running parallel with it in &s;everal of its particulars.</P>
<P>In the next place, when the quotation is not only apt, but has in it a turn of Wit or Satyr, it is &s;till the better qualified for a Medal, as it has a double capacity of plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>But there is no In&s;cription fitter for a Medal, in my opinion, than a quotation that be&s;ides its aptne&s;s has &s;omething in it lofty and &s;ublime: for &s;uch an one &s;trikes in with the natural great|ne&s;s of the &s;oul, and produces a high idea of the per&s;on or action it celebrates, which is one of the principal de&s;igns of a Medal.</P>
<P>It is certainly very plea&s;ant, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> to &s;ee a ver&s;e of an old Poet, revolting as it were from its original &s;en&s;e, and &s;iding with a modern &s;ubject. But then it ought to do it wil|lingly of its own accord, without being forced to it by any change in the words, or the punctua|tion: for when this happens, it is no longer the ver&s;e of an ancient Poet, but of him that has converted it to his own u&s;e.</P>
<P>You have, I believe, by this time exhau&s;ted your &s;ubject, &s;ays <HI>Philander</HI>; and I think the critici&s;ms you have made on the poetical quota|tions that we &s;o often meet with in our modern Medals, may be very well applied to the Mottos of books, and other In&s;criptions of the &s;ame nature. But before, we quit the Legends of Me|dals, I cannot but take notice of a kind of wit
<PB N="159" REF="155">
that flouri&s;hes very much on many of the mo|dern, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Germany,</HI> when they re|pre&s;ent in the In&s;cription the year in which they were coined. As to mention to you another of <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus. C</HI>HR<HI>I</HI>ST<HI>V</HI>S <HI>DVX</HI> ER|GO TR<HI>IVM</HI>PH<HI>V</HI>S. If you take the pains to pick out the figures from the &s;everal words, and range them in their proper order, you will find they amount to 1627, the year in which the Me|dal was coined; for do not you ob&s;erve &s;ome of the letters di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the re&s;t, and top it over their fellows? the&s;e you mu&s;t con&s;ider in a double capacity, as letters and as cy|phers. Your laborious <HI>German</HI> Wits will turn you over a whole Dictionary for one of the&s;e in|genious Devices. You would fancy perhaps they were &s;earching after an apt cla&s;&s;ical term, but in|&s;tead of that, they are looking out a word that has an L. an M. or a D. in it. When there|fore you &s;ee any of the&s;e In&s;criptions, you are not &s;o much to look in them for the thought, as for the year of the Lord. There are foreign U|niver&s;ities where this kind of wit is &s;o much in vogue, that as you prai&s;e a man in <HI>England</HI> for being an excellent Philo&s;opher or Poet, it is an or|dinary character among them to be a great Chro|nogrammati&s;t. The&s;e are probably, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> &s;ome of tho&s;e mild provinces of Acro&s;tic land, that Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has a&s;&s;igned to his Anagrams, Wings and Altars. We have now done, I &s;up|po&s;e, with the Legend of a Medal. I think you promi&s;ed us in the next place to &s;peak of the Fi|gures.</P>
<P>As we had a great deal of talk on this part of a Coin, replied <HI>Philander,</HI> in our di&s;cour&s;e on
<PB N="160" REF="156">
the U&s;efulne&s;s of ancient Medals, I &s;hall only ju&s;t touch on the chief heads wherein the Ancient and the Modern differ. In the fir&s;t place, the <HI>Romans</HI> always appear in the proper Dre&s;s of their country, in&s;omuch that you &s;ee the little variations of the Mode in the drapery of the Medal. They would have thought it ridiculous to have drawn an Emperor of <HI>Rome</HI> in a <HI>Gre|cian</HI> Cloak or a <HI>Phrygian</HI> Mitre. On the con|trary, our modern Medals are full of <HI>Toga's</HI> and <HI>Tunica's, Trabea's</HI> and <HI>Paludamentums,</HI> with a multitude of the like antiquated garments, that have not been in fa&s;hion the&s;e thou&s;and years. You &s;ee very often a King of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>France</HI> dre&s;&s;ed up like a <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI> One would think they had a mind to pa&s;s them&s;elves upon po&s;teri|ty for <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation may run through &s;everal cu&s;toms and religions, that appear in our ancient and modern Coins. Nothing is more u&s;ual than to &s;ee Allu&s;ions to <HI>Roman</HI> cu&s;toms and ceremonies on the Medals of our own nation. Nay very often they carry the figure of a heathen god. If po&s;terity takes its notions of us from our Medals, they mu&s;t fancy one of our Kings paid a great devotion to <HI>Miner|va,</HI> that another was a profe&s;&s;ed Wor&s;hipper of <HI>Apollo,</HI> or at be&s;t that our whole religion was a mixture of Pagani&s;m and Chri&s;tianity. Had the old <HI>Romans</HI> been guilty of the &s;ame extravagance, there would have been &s;o great a confu&s;ion in their Antiquities, that their Coins would not have had half the u&s;es we now find in them. We ought to look on Medals as &s;o many monu|ments con&s;igned over to Eternity, that may po&s;|&s;ibly la&s;t when all other memorials of the &s;ame
<PB N="161" REF="157">
Age are worn out or lo&s;t. They are a kind of Pre&s;ent that tho&s;e who are actually in Being make over to &s;uch as lie hid within the depths of Futu|rity. Were they only de&s;igned to in&s;truct the three or four &s;ucceeding generations, they are in no great danger of being mi&s;under&s;tood: but as they may pa&s;s into the hands of a po&s;terity, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie many removes from us, and are like to act their part in the world, when its governments, manners and religions may be quite altered; we ought to take a particular care not to make any fal&s;e reports in them, or to charge them with any Devices that may look doubtful or unintelligible.</P>
<P>I have lately &s;een, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> a Medallic hi&s;tory of the pre&s;ent King of <HI>France.</HI> One might expect, methinks, to &s;ee the Medals of that na|tion in the highe&s;t perfection, when there is a &s;o|ciety pen&s;ioned and &s;et apart on purpo&s;e for the de&s;igning of them.</P>
<P>We will examine them, if you plea&s;e, &s;ays <HI>Phi|lander,</HI> in the light that our foregoing ob&s;erva|tions have &s;et them: but on this condition that you do not look on the faults I find in them any more than my own private opinion. In the fir&s;t place then, I think it is impo&s;&s;ible to learn from the <HI>French</HI> Medals either the religion, cu&s;tom, or habits of the <HI>French</HI> nation. You &s;ee on &s;ome of them the Cro&s;s of our Saviour, and on others <HI>Hercules</HI>' his Club. In one you have an Angel, and in another a <HI>Mercury.</HI> I fancy, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> po&s;terity would be as much puzzled on the reli|gion of <HI>Louis le Grand,</HI> were they to learn it from his Medals, as we are at pre&s;ent on that of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great. It is certain, &s;ays <HI>Phi|lander,</HI> there is the &s;ame mixture of Chri&s;tian and
<PB N="162" REF="158">
Pagan in their Coins; nor is there a le&s;s confu|&s;ion in their cu&s;toms. For example, what rela|tion is there between the figure of a Bull, and the planting of a <HI>French</HI> colony in <HI>America</HI>? The <HI>Romans</HI> made u&s;e of this type in allu&s;ion to one of their own cu&s;toms at the &s;ending out of a co|lony. But for the <HI>French,</HI> a Ram, a Hog, or an Elephant, would have been every whit as &s;igni|ficant an emblem. Then can any thing be more unnatural than to &s;ee a King of <HI>France</HI> dre&s;&s;ed like an Emperor of <HI>Rome,</HI> with his arms &s;tripped up to the elbows, a Laurel on his head, and a <HI>Chlamys</HI> over his &s;houlders? I fancy, &s;ays <HI>Euge|nius,</HI> the &s;ociety of Medalli&s;ts would give you their rea&s;ons for what they have done. You your &s;elf allow the Legend to be <HI>Latin,</HI> and why may not the cu&s;toms and ornaments be of the &s;ame country as the language? e&s;pecially &s;ince they are all of them &s;o univer&s;ally under&s;tood by the learned. I own to you, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> if they only de&s;ign to deliver down to po&s;terity the &s;everal parts of their Great Monarch's hi&s;to|ry, it is no matter for the other circum&s;tances of a Medal; but I fancy it would be as great a plea|&s;ure and in&s;truction for future ages, to &s;ee the Dre&s;|&s;es and Cu&s;toms of their ance&s;tors, as their Buil|dings and Victories. Be&s;ides, I do not think they have always cho&s;en a proper Occa&s;ion for a Me|dal. There is one &s;truck, for example, on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> failing in their attempts on <HI>Dunkirk</HI>: when in the la&s;t reign they endeavoured to blow up a Fort, and bombard the town. What have the <HI>French</HI> here done to boa&s;t of? A Medal how|ever you have with this in&s;cription, DVNKIRKA ILLAESA. Not to cavil at the two K's in
<PB N="163" REF="159">
<HI>Dunkirka,</HI> or the impropriety of the word <HI>Illae&s;a,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he whole Medal, in my opinion, tends not &s;o much to the honour of the <HI>French</HI> as of the <HI>Eng|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h,</HI>
<Q LANG="lat"><L>&mdash;quos opimus</L>
<L>Fallere et effugere e&s;t triumphus.</L></Q>
I could mention a few other faults, or at lea&s;t what I take for &s;uch. But at &s;ame time mu&s;t be forced to allow, that this Series of Medals is the mo&s;t perfect of any among the moderns in the beauty of the Work, the aptne&s;s of the De|vice, and the propriety of the Legend. In the&s;e and other particulars, the <HI>French</HI> Medals come nearer the ancients than tho&s;e of any other coun|try, as indeed it is to this nation we are indebted for the be&s;t lights that have been given to the whole &s;cience in general.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not here forget to mention the Medal|lic hi&s;tory of the Popes, where there are many Coins of an excellent workman&s;hip, as I think they have none of tho&s;e faults that I have &s;poken of in the preceding &s;ett. They are always <HI>Roman</HI>-Catholic in the Device and in the Legend, which are both of them many times taken out of the ho|ly Scriptures, and therefore not un&s;uitable to the character of the Prince they repre&s;ent. Thus when <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. lay under terrible apprehen|&s;ions of the <HI>French</HI> King, he put out a Coin, that on the rever&s;e of it had a &s;hip to&s;&s;ed on the waves to repre&s;ent the Church. Before it, was the figure of our Saviour walking on the waters, and St. <HI>Peter</HI> ready to &s;ink at his feet. The in|&s;cription, if I remember, was in <HI>Latin. Help
<PB N="164" REF="160">
Lord, or el&s;e I peri&s;h.</HI> This puts me in mind, &s;ays <HI>Cynthio,</HI> of a Pa&s;quinade, that at the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ime was fixed up at <HI>Rome. Ad Galli cantum Petrus flet.</HI> But methinks, under this head of the figures on ancient and modern Coins, we might expect to hear your opinion on the difference that appears in the Workman&s;hip of each. You mu&s;t know then, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> that till about the end of the third Century, when there was a gene|ral decay in all the arts of de&s;igning, I do not re|member to have &s;een the head of a <HI>Roman</HI> Em|peror drawn with a full face. They always ap|pear in <HI>profil,</HI> to u&s;e a <HI>French</HI> term of art, which gives us the view of a head, that, in my opinion, has &s;omething in it very maje&s;tic, and at the &s;ame time &s;uits be&s;t with the dimen&s;ions of a Medal. Be&s;ides that it &s;hows the no&s;e and eyebrows, with the &s;everal prominencies and fallings in of the fea|tures, much more di&s;tinctly than any other kind of figure. In the lower Empire you have abundance of broad <HI>Gothic</HI> faces, like &s;o many full Moons on the &s;ide of a Coin. Among the moderns too, we have of both &s;orts, though the fine&s;t are made after the antique. In the next place, you find the figures of many ancient Coins ri&s;ing up in a much more beautiful <HI>relief</HI> than tho&s;e on the modern. This too is a beauty that fell with the grandeur of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, &s;o that you &s;ee the face &s;inking by degrees in the &s;everal declen&s;ions of the Empire, till about <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI>'s time it lies al|mo&s;t even with the &s;urface of the Medal. After this it appears &s;o very plain and uniform, that one would think the Coiner look'd on the flatne&s;s of a figure as one of the greate&s;t beauties in Sculp|ture. I fancy, &s;ays <HI>Eugenius,</HI> the Sculptors of
<PB N="165" REF="161">
that age had the &s;ame reli&s;h as a <HI>Greek</HI> Prie&s;t that was buying &s;ome religious pictures at <HI>Venice.</HI> A|mong others he was &s;hown a noble piece of <HI>Ti|tian.</HI> The Prie&s;t having well &s;urvey'd it, was ve|ry much &s;candalized at the extravagance of the <HI>relief,</HI> as he termed it. You know, &s;ays he, our religion forbids all idolatry: We admit of no I|mages but &s;uch as are drawn on a &s;mooth &s;ur|face: The figure you have here &s;hown me, &s;tands &s;o much out to the eye, that I would no &s;ooner &s;uf|fer it in my Church than a Statue. I could re|commend your <HI>Greek</HI> Prie&s;t, &s;ays <HI>Philander,</HI> to a|bundance of celebrated Painters on this &s;ide of the <HI>Alps</HI> that would not fail to plea&s;e him. We mu&s;t own however, that the figures on &s;everal of our modern Medals are rai&s;ed and rounded to a very great perfection. But if you compare them in this particular with the mo&s;t fini&s;hed among the ancients, your men of art declare univer&s;ally for the latter.</P>
<P><HI>Cynthio</HI> and <HI>Eugenius,</HI> though they were well plea&s;ed with <HI>Philander</HI>'s di&s;cour&s;e, were glad how|ever to find it at an end: for the Sun began to gather &s;trength upon them, and had pierced the &s;helter of their walks in &s;everal places. <HI>Philan|der</HI> had no &s;ooner done talking, but he grew &s;en|&s;ible of the heat him&s;elf, and immediately propo|&s;ed to his friends the retiring to his lodgings, and getting a thicker &s;hade over their heads. They both of them very readily clo&s;ed with the propo|&s;al, and by that means give me an opportunity of fini&s;hing my Dialogue.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Author of the following E&s;&s;ay has endeavoured to draw into one continued &s;cheme the whole &s;tate of the pre&s;ent war, and the methods that appear to him the mo&s;t proper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or bringing it to a happy conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>After having con&s;idered that the <HI>French</HI> are the con&s;tant and mo&s;t dangerous enemies to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation, and that the danger from them is now grea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er than ever, and will &s;till increa&s;e till their pre&s;ent Union with <HI>Spain</HI> be broken, he &s;ets forth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;everal advantages which this Union has already given <HI>France,</HI> and taken from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> in re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> the woollen manufacture, the trade of the <HI>Levant,</HI> and the naval power of the two nations.</P>
<P>He &s;hews how the&s;e advantages will &s;till ri&s;e higher after a peace, notwith&s;tanding our pre&s;ent conque&s;ts, with new additions, &s;hould be confirmed to us, as well becau&s;e the monarchy of <HI>Spain</HI> would not be weakened by &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions, as becau&s;e no Guarantee could be found &s;ufficient to &s;ecure them to us. For which rea&s;ons he lays it down as a fixt Rule, that no peace is to be made without an entire di&s;union of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchies.</P>
<P>That this may be brought about, he endeavours to prove from the progre&s;s we have already made towards it, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;es w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have purcha&s;ed in
<PB REF="202">
the pre&s;ent war, which are very con&s;iderable if well pur&s;ued, but of no effect if we acquie&s;ce in them.</P>
<P>In order to complete this di&s;union in which we have gone &s;o far, he would not have us rely upon exhau&s;ting the <HI>French</HI> Trea&s;ury, attempts on the <HI>Spani&s;h Indies,</HI> De&s;cents on <HI>France,</HI> but chiefly upon out-numbring them in troops, <HI>France</HI> being already drained of her be&s;t &s;upplies, and the con|federates ma&s;ters of much greater forces for multi|tude and &s;trength, both in men and hor&s;e, and pro|vided with Generals of greater fame and abilities.</P>
<P>He then con&s;iders the wrong mea&s;ures we have hitherto taken in making too &s;mall levies after a &s;uc|ce&s;sful campaign, in regulating their number by that of the enemies forces, and hiring them of our confederates; &s;hewing at the &s;ame time the incon|veniences we &s;uffer from &s;uch hired troops, and &s;e|veral advantages we might receive from employing tho&s;e of our own nation.</P>
<P>He further recommends this augmentation of our forces, to prevent the keeping up a &s;tanding bo|dy of them in times of peace, to enable us to make an impre&s;&s;ion on the Enemy in the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of the war, and to &s;ecure our &s;elves again&s;t a Prince, who is now at the head of a powerful army, and has not yet declared him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place, he an&s;wers by &s;everal con&s;ide|rations tho&s;e two popular objections. That we fur|ni&s;h more towards the war than the re&s;t of the Allies, and That we are not able to contribute more than we do already.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the mo&s;t material heads of the follow|ing E&s;&s;ay, in which there are many other &s;ubordi|nate reflections that naturally grow out of &s;o copious a &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRESENT <HI>STATE</HI> of the <HI>WAR,</HI> AND The Nece&s;&s;ity of an Augmentation, con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>French</HI> are certainly the mo&s;t implacable, and the mo&s;t dangerous enemies of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> nation. Their form of government, their religion, their jealou&s;y of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> power, as well as their pro&s;ecutions or commerce, and pur&s;uits of univer&s;al Monarchy, will fix them for ever in their animo&s;ities and aver&s;ions to|wards us, and make them catch at all oppor|tunities of &s;ubverting our con&s;titution, de&s;troying our religion, ruining our trade, and &s;inking the figure which we make among the nations of
<PB N="242" REF="204">
<HI>Europe:</HI> Not to mention the particular ties of honour that lie on their pre&s;ent King to impo&s;e on us a Prince, who mu&s;t prove fatal to our country if he ever reigns over us.</P>
<P>As we are thus in a natural &s;tate of war, if I may &s;o call it, with the <HI>French</HI> nation; it is our misfortune, that they are not only the mo&s;t inve|terate, but mo&s;t formidable of our enemies; and have the greate&s;t power, as well as the &s;tronge&s;t inclination, to ruin us. No other &s;tate equals them in the force of their fleets and armies, in the nearne&s;s and conveniency of their &s;ituation, and in the number of friends and well-wi&s;hers, which, it is to be feared, they have among us.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, our wars with <HI>France</HI> have always affected us in our mo&s;t tender intere&s;ts, and concerned us more than tho&s;e we have had with any other nation; but I may venture to &s;ay, this Kingdom was never yet engaged in a war of &s;o great con&s;equence, as that which now lies up|on our hands. Our All is at &s;take, and irretrie|vably lo&s;t, if we fail of &s;ucce&s;s. At other times, if a war ended in a di&s;honourable peace, or with equal lo&s;s, we could comfort our &s;elves with the hopes of a more favourable juncture, that might &s;et the balance right, or turn it to our advan|tage. We had &s;till the pro&s;pect of forming the &s;ame alliance, or perhaps &s;trengthning it with new confederacies, and by that means of trying our fortune a &s;econd time, in ca&s;e the inju&s;tice or ambition of the enemy forced us into the field. At pre&s;ent, if we make a drawn game of it, or procure but moderate advantages, we are in a condition which every <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> heart mu&s;t tremble at the thought of. There are no &s;econd tryals,
<PB N="243" REF="205">
no wars in re&s;erve, no new &s;chemes of alliance to which we can have recour&s;e. Should the <HI>French</HI> King be able to bear down &s;uch an united force as now makes head again&s;t him, at a time when <HI>Spain</HI> affords him no greater a&s;&s;i&s;tance; what will he do when the trade of the <HI>Levant</HI> lies at his mercy; when the whole kingdom of <HI>Spain</HI> is &s;upplied with his manufactures, and the wealth of the <HI>Indies</HI> flows into his coffers; and, what is yet wor&s;e, when this additional &s;trength mu&s;t ari&s;e in all its particulars from a propor|tionable decay in the States that now make war upon him? It is no wonder therefore that our late King of glorious memory, who, by the confe&s;|&s;ion of his greate&s;t enemies, was a Prince that perfectly under&s;tood the intere&s;ts of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;hould in his la&s;t &s;peech recommend to his Par|liament the declaring war again&s;t <HI>France</HI> in tho&s;e memorable words: <HI>You have yet an opportunity, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, to &s;ecure to you and your po&s;teri|ty the quiet enjoyment of your religion and liber|ties, if you are not wanting to your &s;elves, but will exert the ancient vigour of the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>nation: but I tell you plainly, my opinion is, if you do not lay hold on this occa&s;ion, you have no rea&s;on to hope for another.</HI></P>
<P>We have already a dreadful proof of the in|crea&s;e of power that accrues to <HI>France</HI> from its conjunction with <HI>Spain.</HI> So expen&s;ive a war as that which the <HI>French</HI> Monarchy hath been car|rying on in &s;o many and &s;o remote parts at once, mu&s;t long &s;ince have drained and exhau&s;ted all its &s;ub&s;tance, had there not been &s;everal &s;ecret &s;prings, that &s;welled their trea&s;ury from time to time, in proportion as the war has &s;unk it. The King's
<PB N="244" REF="206">
coffers have been often reduced to the lowe&s;t ebb, but have &s;till been &s;ea&s;onably refre&s;hed by frequent and unexpected &s;upplies from the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h America.</HI> We hear indeed of the arrival but of very few &s;hips from tho&s;e parts; but as in eve|ry ve&s;&s;el there is &s;towage for immen&s;e trea&s;ures, when the cargo is pure Bullion, or merchandi&s;e of as great a value: &s;o we find by experience they have had &s;uch prodigious &s;ums of money con|veyed to them by the&s;e &s;ecret channels, that they have been enabled to pay more numerous armies, than they ever had on foot before; and that at a time when their trade fails in all its other branches, and is di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by all the arts and contrivances of their neighbouring nations. During the la&s;t four years, by a mode&s;t computation, there have been brought into <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> above &s;ix millions of pounds &s;terling in bullion. What then &s;hall we &s;uppo&s;e wou'd be the effect of this corre&s;pondence with <HI>America,</HI> might the wealth of tho&s;e parts come to them on &s;quadrons of men of war, and fleets of galeons? If the&s;e little by-currents, that creep into the country by &s;tealth, have &s;o great a force, how &s;hall we &s;tem the whole torrent, when it breaks in upon us with its full violence? and this certainly will be our ca&s;e, unle&s;s we find a means to di&s;&s;olve the union between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> I have dwelt the longer on this con&s;ideration, be|cau&s;e the pre&s;ent war hath already furni&s;hed us with the experiment, and &s;en&s;ibly convinced us of the increa&s;e of power, which <HI>France</HI> has recei|ved from its intercour&s;e with the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>As there are many who look upon every thing which they do not actually &s;ee and feel as b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="245" REF="207">
probability and &s;peculation, I &s;hall only touch on tho&s;e other rea&s;ons of which we have already had &s;ome experience, for our preventing this coalition of intere&s;ts and de&s;igns in the two monarchies.</P>
<P>The Woollen manufacture is the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;trength, the &s;taple commodity and proper growth of our country; if this fails us, our trade and e&s;tates mu&s;t &s;ink together, and all the ca&s;h of the nation be con&s;umed on foreign merchandize. The <HI>French</HI> at pre&s;ent gain very much upon us in this great article of our trade, and &s;ince the acce&s;|&s;ion of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> monarchy, &s;upply with cloth, of their own making, the very be&s;t mart we had in <HI>Europe.</HI> And what a melancholy pro&s;pect have we, if ever a peace gives them leave to enrich their manufacture with mixtures of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> wool, to multiply the hands employed in it, to improve them&s;elves in all the niceties of the art, and to vend their wares in tho&s;e places where was the greate&s;t con&s;umption of our woollen works, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable gain for the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> mer|chant? Notwith&s;tanding our many &s;ea&s;onable re|cruits from <HI>Portugal</HI> and our plantations, we al|ready complain of our want of bullion; and mu&s;t at la&s;t be reduced to the greate&s;t exigencies, if this great &s;ource be dryed up, and our traffick with <HI>Spain</HI> continue under its pre&s;ent di&s;courage|ment.</P>
<P>The trade of the <HI>Levant</HI> mu&s;t likewi&s;e flouri&s;h or decay in our hands, as we are friends or ene|mies of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> monarchy. The late con|que&s;t of <HI>Naples</HI> will very little alter the ca&s;e, though <HI>Sicily</HI> &s;hould follow the fate of her &s;i&s;ter kingdom. The <HI>Streight</HI>'s mouth is the key of the <HI>Levant,</HI> and will be always in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="246" REF="208">
tho&s;e who are Kings of <HI>Spain.</HI> We may only add, that the &s;ame cau&s;es which &s;traiten the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> commerce, will naturally enlarge the <HI>French</HI>; and that the naval force of either nation will thrive or langui&s;h in the &s;ame degree as their commerce gathers or lo&s;es &s;trength. And if &s;o powerful and populous a nation as that of <HI>France</HI> become &s;uperior to us by &s;ea, our whole is lo&s;t, and we are no more a people. The con&s;idera|tion of &s;o narrow a channel betwixt us, of &s;uch numbers of regular troops on the enemy's &s;ide, of &s;o &s;mall a &s;tanding force on our own, and that too in a country de&s;titute of all &s;uch forts and &s;trong places as might &s;top the progre&s;s of a victorious army, hath &s;omething in it &s;o terrify|ing, that one does not care for &s;etting it in its proper light. Let it not therefore enter into the heart of any one that hath the lea&s;t zeal for his religion, or love of liberty, that, hath any regard either to the honour or &s;afety of his country, or a well wi&s;h for his friends or po&s;terity, to think of a peace with <HI>France,</HI> till the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> monar|chy be entirely torn from it, and the hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> di&s;abled from ever giving the law to <HI>Eu|rope.</HI></P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>French</HI> King would grant us the mo&s;t advantageous terms we can de&s;ire; without the &s;eparation of the two monar|chies they mu&s;t infallibly end in our de&s;truction. Should he &s;ecure to us all our pre&s;ent acqui&s;i|tions; &s;hould he add two or three frontier-towns to what we have already in <HI>Flanders</HI>; &s;hould he join the kingdoms of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Sardinia</HI> to <HI>Mi|lan</HI> and <HI>Naples</HI>; &s;hould he leave King <HI>Charles</HI> in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Catalonia</HI>; &s;hould
<PB N="247" REF="209">
he make over to <HI>Great Britain</HI> the town and harbour of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> as well as that of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and at the &s;ame time re&s;ign his conque&s;ts in <HI>Portugal</HI>: it would all be of no effect towards the common &s;afety of <HI>Europe,</HI> while the bulk of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> continent and the riches of <HI>America</HI> remain in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Bourbon</HI> family.</P>
<P><HI>Boccalini</HI> when he weighs the States of <HI>Europe</HI> in his political balance, after having laid <HI>France</HI> ill one &s;cale, throws <HI>Spain</HI> into the other, which wanted but very little of being a counter-poi&s;e. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon this, &s;ays he, begun to pro|mi&s;e them&s;elves the honour of the ballance; reckoning that if <HI>Spain</HI> of it &s;elf weighed &s;o well, they could not fail of &s;ucce&s;s when the &s;everal parts of the monarchy were lumped in the &s;ame &s;cale. Their &s;urpri&s;e was very great when upon the throwing in of <HI>Naples</HI> they &s;aw the &s;cale ri&s;e, and was greater &s;till when they found that <HI>Milan</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI> had the &s;ame effect. The truth of it is, the&s;e parts of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> monarchy are ra|ther for ornament than &s;trength. They furni&s;h out Vice-royalties for the Grandees, and po&s;ts of honour for the noble families; but in a time of war are incumbrances to the main body of the kingdom, and leave it naked and expo&s;ed by the great number of hands they draw from it to their defence. Should we therefore continue in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what we have already made our &s;elves ma&s;ters, with &s;uch additions as have been mentioned, we &s;hould have little more than the excre&s;cencies of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> monarchy. The &s;trength of it will &s;till join it &s;elf to <HI>France,</HI> and grow the clo&s;er to it by its di&s;union from the re&s;t. And in this ca&s;e the advantages which mu&s;t ari&s;e
<PB N="248" REF="210">
to that people from their intimate alliance with the remaining part of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> dominions, would in a very few years not only repair all the damages they have &s;u&s;tained in the pre&s;ent war, but fill the kingdom with more riches than it hath yet had in its mo&s;t flouri&s;hing periods.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King hath often entered on &s;everal expen&s;ive projects, on purpo&s;e to di&s;&s;ipate the wealth that is continually gathering in his coffers in times of peace. He hath employed immen&s;e &s;ums on architecture, gardening, water-works, painting, &s;tatuary, and the like, to di&s;tribute his trea&s;ures among his people, as well as to hu|mour his plea&s;ures and his ambition; but if he once engro&s;&s;es the commerce of the <HI>Spani&s;h Indies,</HI> whatever quantities of gold and &s;ilver &s;tagnate in his private coffers, there will be &s;till enough to carry on the circulation among his &s;ubjects. By this means in a &s;hort &s;pace of time he may heap up greater wealth than all the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> joined together; and in the pre&s;ent con&s;ti|tution of the world, wealth and power are but different names for the &s;ame thing. Let us there|fore &s;uppo&s;e that after eight or ten years of peace, he hath a mind to infringe any of his treaties, or invade a neighbouring State; to revive the pre|ten&s;ions of <HI>Spain</HI> upon <HI>Portugal,</HI> or attempt the taking tho&s;e places which were granted us for our &s;ecurity; what re&s;i&s;tance, what oppo&s;ition can we make to &s;o formidable an enemy? Should the &s;ame alliance ri&s;e again&s;t him that is now in war with him, what could we hope for from it, at a time when the States engaged in it will be comparatively weakened, and the enemy who is
<PB N="249" REF="211">
now able to keep them at a &s;tand, will have re|ceived &s;o many new acce&s;&s;ions of &s;trength?</P>
<P>But I think it is not to be imagined that in &s;uch a conjuncture as we here &s;uppo&s;e, the &s;ame confederates, or any other of equal force, could be prevailed upon to join their arms, and endea|vour at the pulling down &s;o exorbitant a power. Some might be bought into his intere&s;ts by mo|ney, others drawn over by fear, and tho&s;e that are liable to neither of the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, might not think their own intere&s;t &s;o much concerned as in the pre&s;ent war; or if any appeared in a di&s;|po&s;ition to enter into &s;uch a confederacy, they might be cru&s;hed &s;eparately before they could con|cert mea&s;ures for their mutual defence.</P>
<P>The keeping together of the pre&s;ent alliance can be a&s;cribed to nothing el&s;e but the clear and evident conviction which every member of it is under, that if it &s;hould once break without ha|ving had its effect, they can never hope for ano|ther opportunity of reuniting, or of prevailing by all the joint efforts of &s;uch an union. Let us therefore agree on this as a fixt rule, and an in|violable maxim, never to lay down our arms a|gain&s;t <HI>France,</HI> till we have utterly disjoined her from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> monarchy. Let this be the fir&s;t &s;tep of a publick treaty, the ba&s;is of a general peace.</P>
<P>Had the pre&s;ent war indeed run again&s;t us, and all our attacks upon the enemy been vain, it might look like a degree of frenzy, or a mixture of ob&s;tinacy and de&s;pair, to be determined on &s;o impracticable an undertaking. But on the contra|ry, we have already done a great part of our work, and are come within view of the end that we
<PB N="250" REF="212">
have been &s;o long driving at. We remain victo|rious in all the &s;eats of war. In <HI>Flanders</HI> we have got into our hands &s;everal open countries, rich towns, and fortified places. We have dri|ven the enemy out of all his alliances, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him of his &s;trong holds, and ruined his allies in <HI>Germany.</HI> We have not only recovered what the beginning of the war had taken from us, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed our&s;elves of the kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> the dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> and the avenue of <HI>France</HI> in <HI>I|taly.</HI> The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> war hath given us a haven for our &s;hips, and the mo&s;t populous and wealthy province of that kingdom. In &s;hort, we have ta|ken all the outlying parts of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> monar|chy, and made impre&s;&s;ions upon the very heart of it. We have beaten the <HI>French</HI> from all their advanced po&s;ts in <HI>Europe,</HI> and driven them into their la&s;t entrenchments. One vigorous pu&s;h on all &s;ides, one general a&s;&s;ault will force the ene|my to cry out for quarter, and &s;urrender them|&s;elves at di&s;cretion. Another <HI>Blenheim</HI> or <HI>Ramil|lies</HI> will make the confederates ma&s;ters of their own terms, and arbitrators of a peace.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the advantages already gained are very con&s;iderable if we pur&s;ue them, they will be of no effect unle&s;s we improve them towards the carrying of our main point. The enemy &s;taggers; if you follow your blow, he falls at your feet; but if you allow him re&s;pite, he will recover his &s;trength, and come upon you with greater fury. We have given him &s;everal repeated wounds that have enfeebled him, and brought him low; but they are &s;uch as time will heal, unle&s;s you take advantage from his pre&s;ent weakne&s;s to redouble your attacks upon him.
<PB N="251" REF="213">
It was a celebrated part in <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s character, and what comes home to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that he thought nothing at all was done, while any thing remained undone. In &s;hort, we have been tugging a great while again&s;t the &s;tream, and have almo&s;t weathered our point; a &s;tretch or two more will do the work; but if in&s;tead of that we &s;lacken our arms, and drop our oars, we &s;hall be hurried back in a moment to the place from whence we fir&s;t &s;et out.</P>
<P>After having &s;een the nece&s;&s;ity of an entire &s;e|paration of the kingdoms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> our &s;ubject naturally leads us into the con&s;idera|tion of the mo&s;t proper means for effecting it.</P>
<P>We have a great while flattered our &s;elves with the pro&s;pect of reducing <HI>France</HI> to our own terms by the want of money among the peo|ple, and the exigencies of the publick trea&s;ury; but have been &s;till di&s;appointed by the great &s;ums imported from <HI>America,</HI> and the many new expedients which the Court hath found out for its relief. A long con&s;umptive war is more likely to break the grand alliance, than di&s;able <HI>France</HI> from maintaining &s;ufficient armies to op|po&s;e it. An arbitrary government will never want money &s;o long as the people have it; and &s;o active a people will always have it, whil&s;t they can &s;end what merchandi&s;es they plea&s;e to <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> &s;ince their al|liance with <HI>Spain</HI> keep thirty &s;hips in con&s;tant motion between the we&s;tern ports of <HI>France</HI> and the &s;outh &s;eas of <HI>America.</HI> The King him&s;elf is an adventurer in this traffick, and be&s;ides the &s;hare that he receives out of the gains of his &s;ubjects, has immen&s;e &s;ums that come directly from it into his own hands.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="214">We may further con&s;ider, that the <HI>French</HI> &s;ince their abandoning <HI>Bavaria</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> have very much retrenched the expence of the war, and lay out among them&s;elves all the money that is con&s;umed in it.</P>
<P>Many are of opinion, that the mo&s;t probable way of bringing <HI>France</HI> to rea&s;on would be by the making an attempt upon the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and by that means to cut off all commu|nication with this great &s;ource of riches, or turn the current of it into our own country. This I mu&s;t confe&s;s carries &s;o promi&s;ing an appear|ance, that I would by no means di&s;courage the attempt: but at the &s;ame time I think it &s;hould be a collateral project rather than our principal de|&s;ign. Such an undertaking (if well concerted, and put into good hands) would be of infinite advantage to the common cau&s;e: but certainly an enterpri&s;e that carries in it the fate of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;hould not turn upon the uncertainty of winds and waves, and be liable to all the accidents that may befal a naval expedition.</P>
<P>Others there are that have long deceived them|&s;elves with the hopes of an in&s;urrection in <HI>France,</HI> and are therefore for laying out all our &s;trength on a de&s;cent. The&s;e, I think, do not enough con&s;ider the natural love which the gro&s;s of mankind have for the con&s;titution of their fa|thers. A man that is not enlightened by travel or reflexion, grows as fond of arbitrary power, to which he hath been u&s;ed from his infancy, as of cold climates, or barren countries in which he hath been born and bred. Be&s;ides, there is a kind of &s;luggi&s;h re&s;ignation, as well as poorne&s;s and degeneracy of &s;pirit, in a &s;tate of &s;lavery,
<PB N="253" REF="215">
that we meet with but very few who will be at the pains or danger of recovering them&s;elves out of it; as we find in hi&s;tory in&s;tances of per|&s;ons who after their pri&s;ons have been flung open, and their fetters &s;truck off, have cho&s;en rather to lan|gui&s;h in their dungeons, than &s;take their mi&s;erable lives and fortunes upon the &s;ucce&s;s of a revolution. I need not in&s;tance the general fate of de&s;cents, the difficulty of &s;upplying men and provi&s;ions by &s;ea again&s;t an enemy that hath both at hand, and without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ecure tho&s;e conque&s;ts that are often made in the fir&s;t on&s;ets of an inva&s;ion. For the&s;e and other rea&s;ons I can never approve the nur&s;ing up commotions and in&s;urrections in the enemy's country, which for want of the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport are likely to end in the ma&s;&s;acre of our friends and the ruin of their families.</P>
<P>The only means therefore for bringing <HI>France</HI> to our conditions, and what appears to me, in all human probability, a &s;ure and infallible expe|dient, is to throw in multitudes upon them, and overpower them with numbers. Would the con|federacy exert it &s;elf as much to annoy the ene|my, as they them&s;elves do for their defence, we might bear them down with the weight of our armies, and in one &s;ummer over&s;et the whole power of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> monarchy is already exhau&s;ted of its be&s;t and brave&s;t &s;ubjects. The flower of the nation is con&s;umed in its wars: the &s;trength of their armies con&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent of &s;uch as have &s;aved them&s;elves by flight from &s;ome or other of the victorious confederates; and the only proper per&s;ons to recruit them are but the refu&s;e of tho&s;e
<PB N="254" REF="216">
who have been already picked out for the &s;ervice. Mare&s;chal <HI>de Vauban,</HI> though infinitely partial in his calculations of the power of <HI>France,</HI> reckons that the number of its inhabitants was two mil|lions le&s;s at the peace of <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> than in the be|ginning of the war that was there concluded: and though that war continued nine years, and this hath as yet la&s;ted but &s;ix, yet con&s;idering that their armies are more &s;trong and numerous; that there hath been much more action in the pre&s;ent war; and that their lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained in it have been very extraordinary; we may, by a moderate computa|tion, &s;uppo&s;e that the pre&s;ent war hath not been le&s;s prejudicial than the foregoing one in the ravage which it has made among the people. There is in <HI>France</HI> &s;o great a di&s;proportion between the num|ber of males and females; and among the former, between tho&s;e who are capable of bearing arms, and &s;uch as are too young, &s;ickly, or decrepit for the &s;ervice; and at the &s;ame time &s;uch va&s;t numbers of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, &s;ecular and religious, who live upon the labours of others, that when the &s;everal trades and profe&s;&s;ions are &s;upplied, you will find mo&s;t of tho&s;e that are proper for war ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for filling up the laborious part of life, and carrying on the underwork of the nation. They have already contributed all their &s;uperfluous hands, and every new levy they make mu&s;t be at the expence of their farms and vine|yards, their manufactures and commerce.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the grand Alliance have in|numerable &s;ources of recruits, not only in <HI>Bri|tain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> and <HI>Flan|ders</HI>; but in all the populous parts of <HI>Germany</HI> that have little trade or manufactures, in propor|tion
<PB N="255" REF="217">
to the number of their inhabitants. We may add, that the <HI>French</HI> have only <HI>Switzerland,</HI> be|&s;ides their own country, to recruit in; and we know the difficulties they meet with in getting thence a &s;ingle regiment: whereas the Allies have not only the &s;ame re&s;ource, but may be &s;upplied for money from <HI>Denmark</HI> and other neutral States. In &s;hort, the Confederates may bring to the field what forces they plea&s;e, if they will be at the charge of them: but <HI>France,</HI> let her wealth be what it will, mu&s;t content her&s;elf with the product of her own country.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> are &s;till in greater &s;treights for &s;up|plies of hor&s;e than men. The breed of their coun|try is neither &s;o good nor numerous as what are to be found in mo&s;t of the countries of the Allies. They had la&s;t &s;ummer about three&s;core thou&s;and in their &s;everal armies, and could not perhaps bring into the field thirty thou&s;and more, if they were di&s;po&s;ed to make &s;uch an augmentation.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> hor&s;e are not only few, but weak in compari&s;on of ours. Their cavalry in the battle of <HI>Blenheim</HI> could not &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> hor&s;e. For this rea&s;on our late way of attacking their troops &s;word in hand is very much to the advantage of our nation, as our men are more robu&s;t, and our hor&s;es of a &s;tronger make than the <HI>French</HI>; and in &s;uch attacks it is the weight of the forces, &s;uppo&s;ing equal courage and conduct, that will always carry it. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;trength turned very much to account in our wars again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> of old, when we u&s;ed to gall them with our long bows, at a greater di|&s;tance than they could &s;hoot their arrows: this advantage we lo&s;t upon the invention of fire-arms,
<PB N="256" REF="218">
but by the pre&s;ent method our &s;trength as well as bravery may again be of u&s;e to us in the day of battle.</P>
<P>We have very great encouragement to &s;end what numbers we are able into the field, becau&s;e our Generals at pre&s;ent are &s;uch as are likely to make the be&s;t u&s;e of them, without throwing them away on any fre&s;h attempts or ill-concert|ed projects. The Confederate armies have the happine&s;s of being commanded by per&s;ons who are e&s;teemed the greate&s;t leaders of the pre&s;ent age, and are perhaps equal to any that have prece|ded them. There is a &s;ort of re&s;emblance in their characters; a particular &s;edatene&s;s in their conver&s;ation and behaviour, that qualifies them for council, with a great intrepidity and re&s;olu|tion that fits them for action. They are all of them men of concealed fire, that doth not break out with noi&s;e and heat in the ordinary circum|&s;tances of life; but &s;hews it &s;elf &s;ufficiently in all great enterpri&s;es that require it. It is true, the General upon the <HI>Rhine</HI> hath not had the &s;ame occa&s;ions as the others to &s;ignalize him&s;elf; but if we con&s;ider the great vigilance, activity and courage, with the con&s;ummate prudence, and the nice &s;en&s;e of honour which appears in that Prince's character, we have great rea&s;on to hope, that as he purcha&s;ed the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s in the pre&s;ent war, by forcing into the &s;ervice of the Confederates an army that was rai&s;ed again&s;t them in the very heart of the Empire, he will give one of the fi|ni&s;hing &s;trokes to it, and help to conclude the great work which he &s;o happily begun. The &s;ud|den check that he gave to the <HI>French</HI> army the la&s;t campaign, and the good order he e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="257" REF="219">
in that of the <HI>Germans,</HI> look like happy pre&s;a|ges of what we may expect from his conduct. I &s;hall not pretend to give any character of the Generals on the enemies &s;ide; but I think we may &s;ay this, that in the eyes of their own nation they are inferior to &s;everal that have formerly com|manded the <HI>French</HI> armies. If then we have greater numbers than the <HI>French,</HI> and at the &s;ame time better Generals, it mu&s;t be our own fault if we will not reap the fruit of &s;uch advantages.</P>
<P>It would be lo&s;s of time to explain any farther our &s;uperiority to the enemy in numbers of men and hor&s;e. We &s;ee plainly that we have the means in our hands, and that nothing but the application of them is wanting. Let us only con|&s;ider what u&s;e the enemy would make of the ad|vantage we have mentioned, if it fell on their &s;ide; and is it not very &s;trange that we &s;hould not be as active and indu&s;trious for our &s;ecurity, as they would certainly be for our de&s;truction? But be|fore we con&s;ider more di&s;tinctly the method we ought to take in the pro&s;ecution of the war, un|der this particular view, let us reflect a little upon tho&s;e we have already taken in the cour&s;e of it for the&s;e &s;ix years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Allies after a &s;ucce&s;sful &s;ummer are too apt, upon the &s;trength of it, to neglect their pre|parations for the en&s;uing campaign, while the <HI>French</HI> leave no art nor &s;tratagem untried to fill up the empty &s;paces of their armies, and &s;well them to an equal bulk with tho&s;e of the Confede|rates. By this means our advantage is lo&s;t, and the fate of <HI>Europe</HI> brought to a &s;econd deci&s;ion. It is now become an ob&s;ervation, that we are to expect a very indifferent year after a very &s;ucce&s;s|ful
<PB N="258" REF="220">
one. <HI>Blenheim</HI> was followed by a &s;ummer that makes no noi&s;e in the war. <HI>Ramillies, Turin,</HI> and <HI>Barcelona,</HI> were the parents of our la&s;t cam|paign. So many dreadful blows alarmed the ene|my, and rai&s;ed their whole country up in arms. Had we on our &s;ide made proportionable prepara|tions, the war by this time had been brought to a happy i&s;&s;ue. If after having gained the great vi|ctories of <HI>Blenheim</HI> and <HI>Ramillies,</HI> we had made the &s;ame efforts as we &s;hould have done had we lo&s;t them, the power of <HI>France</HI> could not have with&s;tood us.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the winter we u&s;ually get what intelligence we can of the force which the enemy intends to employ in the campaigns of the &s;ucceeding year, and immediately ca&s;t about for a &s;ufficient number of troops to face them in the field of battle. This, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, would be a good method if we were engaged in a de|fen&s;ive war. We might maintain our ground with an equal number of forces; but our bu&s;ine&s;s is not only to &s;ecure what we are already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; we are to wre&s;t the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy out of the hands of the enemy; and in order to it, to work our way into the heart of his country by dint of arms. We &s;hould there|fore put forth all our &s;trength, and without hav|ing an eye to his preparations, make the greate&s;t pu&s;h that we are able on our own &s;ide. We are told that the enemy at pre&s;ent thinks of rai&s;ing three&s;core thou&s;and men for the next &s;ummer; if we regulate our levies in that view, we do no|thing; let us perform our utmo&s;t, as they do, and we &s;hall overwhelm them with our multitudes. We have it in our power at lea&s;t to be four times
<PB N="259" REF="221">
as &s;trong as the <HI>French,</HI> but if ten men are in war with forty, and the latter detach only an e|qual number to the engagement, what benefit do they receive from their &s;uperiority?</P>
<P>It &s;eems therefore to be the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Con|federates to turn to their advantage their apparent odds in men and hor&s;e; and by that means to out-number the enemy in all rencounters and en|gagements. For the &s;ame rea&s;on it mu&s;t be for the intere&s;t of the Allies to &s;eek all opportu|nities of battle, becau&s;e all lo&s;&s;es on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide are made up with infinitely more difficulty than on ours; be&s;ides that the <HI>French</HI> do their bu&s;ine&s;s by lying &s;till, and have no other con|cern in the war than to hold fa&s;t what they have already got into their hands.</P>
<P>The mi&s;carriage of the noble&s;t project that ever was formed in <HI>Europe,</HI> can be a&s;cribed to no|thing el&s;e but our want of numbers in the &s;everal quarters of the war. If our armies on all &s;ides had begun to bu&s;y and in&s;ult the enemy, at the &s;ame time that the forces marched out of <HI>Pie|mont, Toulon</HI> had been at pre&s;ent in the hands of the Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> But could that Prince ever have imagined that the <HI>French</HI> would have been at liberty to detach whole armies again&s;t him? or will it appear credible to po&s;terity, that in a war carried on by the joint force of &s;o many populous and powerful nations, <HI>France</HI> could &s;end &s;o great a part of its troops to one &s;eat of the war, without &s;uffering in any of the re&s;t? Whereas it is well known, that if the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> had continued before <HI>Toulon</HI> eight days longer, he had been attacked by an army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, which was more than double the
<PB N="260" REF="222">
number of his own; and yet the enemy was &s;trong enough every where el&s;e to prevent the Confederates from making any impre&s;&s;ion upon them. However, let us fall into the right mea|&s;ures, and we may hope that the &s;troke is only de|ferred. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> hath &s;ecured a pa&s;&s;age into <HI>Dauphiny,</HI> and if the Allies make &s;uch efforts in all parts, as we may rea&s;onably expect from them, that Prince may &s;till make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the <HI>French</HI> dominions on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Rhone.</HI></P>
<P>There is another part of our conduct which may perhaps de&s;erve to be con&s;idered. As &s;oon as we have agreed with the States-General upon any augmentation of our forces, we immediate|ly negotiate with &s;ome or other of the <HI>German</HI> Princes, who are in the &s;ame confederacy, to fur|ni&s;h out our quota in Mercenaries. This may be doubly prejudicial to the alliance; Fir&s;t, as it may have an ill influence on the re&s;olutions of tho&s;e Princes in the Diet of the Empire, who may be willing to &s;ettle as &s;mall a quota as they can for them&s;elves, that they may have more troops to hire out; and in the next place, as it may hin|der them from contributing the whole quota which they have &s;ettled This actually happened in the la&s;t campaign, when we are told the <HI>Ger|mans</HI> excu&s;ed them&s;elves for their want of troops upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> as having already put mo&s;t of their forces into the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ervice. Such an excu&s;e, indeed, is very unju&s;t, but it would be better to give them no occa&s;ion of making it; and on &s;uch occa&s;ions to con&s;ider what men are apt to do, as well as what they may do with rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="223">It might therefore be for our advantage that all the foreign troops in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> pay &s;hould be rai|&s;ed in neutral countries. <HI>Switzerland</HI> in parti|cular, if timely applied to, might be of great u&s;e to us; no only in re&s;pect of the reinforcements which we might draw from thence, but be|cau&s;e &s;uch a draught of forces would le&s;&s;en the number of tho&s;e that might otherwi&s;e be employ|ed in the <HI>French</HI> &s;ervice. The bulk of our levies &s;hould neverthele&s;s be rai&s;ed in our own coun|try, it being impo&s;&s;ible for neutral States to fur|ni&s;h both the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> with a &s;ufficient number of effective men; be&s;ides that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;oldiers will be more at the di&s;po&s;al of their Ge|neral, and act with greater vigour under the conduct of one for whom they have &s;o ju&s;t a va|lue, and whom they do not con&s;ider only as their leader, but as their country-man. We may like|wi&s;e &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;oldiers of a neutral &s;tate, who are not animated by any national intere&s;t, cannot fight for pay with the &s;ame ardour and alacrity, as men that fight for their Prince and country, their wives and children.</P>
<P>It may likewi&s;e be worth while to con&s;ider whether the military Genius of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nation may not fall by degrees, and become inferior to that of our neighbouring &s;tates, if it hath no oc|ca&s;ion to exert it &s;elf. Minds that are altogether &s;et on trade and profit, often contract a certain narrowne&s;s of temper, and at length become un|capable of great and generous re&s;olutions. Should the <HI>French</HI> ever make an unexpected de|&s;cent upon us, we might want &s;oldiers of our own growth to ri&s;e up in our defence; and might not have time to draw a &s;ufficient number of
<PB N="262" REF="224">
troops to our relief from the remote corners of <HI>Germany.</HI> It is generally &s;aid, that if King <HI>Charles</HI> II. had made war upon <HI>France</HI> in the be|ginning of his reign, he might have conquered it by the many veterans which were &s;cattered up and down this kingdom, and had been inured to &s;ervice in the civil wars. It is to be hoped we &s;hall never have &s;uch another nur&s;ery of &s;oldiers; but if the pre&s;ent war gives a more military turn to all other nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> than to our own, it is to be feared we may lo&s;e in &s;trength, what we gain in number. We may apply the &s;ame con|&s;ideration nearer home. If all our levies are made in <HI>Scotland</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> may not tho&s;e two parts of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> monarchy, after the disbanding of the pre&s;ent army, be too powerful for the re&s;t, in ca&s;e of a revolt? though, God be thanked, we are not in any danger of one at pre&s;ent. However, as the&s;e con&s;iderations do not concern the more e&s;&s;ential part of our de&s;ign, it is &s;uffi|cient to have mentioned them.</P>
<P>The &s;paring of our &s;elves in &s;o important a conjuncture, when we have but this &s;ingle op|portunity left for the pre&s;erving every thing that is precious among&s;t us, is the wor&s;t &s;ort of ma|nagement that we can po&s;&s;ibly fall into. The good husbandry of one age may intail an endle&s;s expence upon all po&s;terity. We mu&s;t venture the &s;acri|ficing a part of our lives and fortunes at pre&s;ent, if we will effectually &s;ecure both for the future. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Kingdom is &s;o well &s;tock'd with people, and &s;o much abounds in hor&s;e, that we have power enough in our own hands, did we make our outmo&s;t u&s;e of it, to humble <HI>France,</HI> and in a campaign or two to put an end to the war.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="225">There is not a more di&s;agreeable thought to the people of <HI>Great Britain</HI> than that of a &s;tanding ar|my. But if a peace be made before the di&s;union of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> there are few, perhaps, that will not think the maintaining a &s;ettled body of numerous forces indi&s;pen&s;able for the &s;afety of our country. We have it therefore in our choice to rai&s;e &s;uch a &s;trong reinforcement of troops as at pre&s;ent may be &s;ufficient, in conjunction with tho&s;e of the allies, for breaking the &s;trength of the enemy; or when the peace is concluded, to keep on foot &s;uch an army as will be nece&s;&s;a|ry for preventing his attempts upon us.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped that tho&s;e who would be the mo&s;t zealous again&s;t keeping up a con&s;tant body of regular troops after a general peace, will the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves for the promoting an augmentation of tho&s;e which are now on foot; and by that means take care that we &s;hall not &s;tand in need of &s;uch an expedient.</P>
<P>We are indeed obliged by the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of our affairs to bring more troops into the field than we have yet done. As the <HI>French</HI> are retired within their lines, and have collected all their &s;trength into a narrow compa&s;s, we mu&s;t have greater numbers to charge them in their in|trenchments, and force them to a battle. We &s;aw the la&s;t campaign that an army of four&s;core thou&s;and of the be&s;t troops in <HI>Europe,</HI> with the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> at the head of them, could do nothing again&s;t an enemy that were too nume|rour to be a&s;&s;aulted in their camps, or attacked in their &s;trong holds.</P>
<P>There is another con&s;ideration which de&s;erves our utmo&s;t attention. We know very well,
<PB N="264" REF="226">
that there is a Prince at the head of a powerful ar|my, who may give a turn to the war, in which we are engaged, if he thinks fit to &s;ide with either party. I cannot pre&s;ume to gue&s;s how far our mini&s;ters may be informed of his de&s;igns: but unle&s;s they have very &s;trong a&s;&s;urances of his falling in with the grand alliance, or not oppo&s;ing it, they cannot be too circum&s;pect and &s;peedy in taking their precautions again&s;t any contrary re|&s;olution. We &s;hall be unpardonable, if after &s;uch an expence of blood and trea&s;ure, we leave it in the power of any &s;ingle Prince to command a peace, and make us accept what conditions he thinks fit. It is certain, according to the po&s;ture of our affairs in the la&s;t campaign, this Prince could have turn'd the ballance on either &s;ide; but it is to be hoped the liberties of <HI>Europe</HI> will not depend any more on the determination of one man's will. I do not &s;peak this becau&s;e I think there is any appearance of that Prince's uni|ting him&s;elf to <HI>France.</HI> On the contrary, as he hath an extraordinary zeal for the reformed reli|gion, and great &s;entiments of honour, I think it is not improbable we &s;hould draw him over to the con|federacy, if we pre&s;s him to it by proper motives. His love for religion, and his &s;en&s;e of glory, will both have their effect on a Prince who hath already di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by being a patron of prote&s;tants, and guarantee of the <HI>We&s;tphalian</HI> trea|ty. And if his intere&s;t hath any part in his acti|ons, the allies may make him greater offers than the <HI>French</HI> King can do in the pre&s;ent conjun|cture. There are large extents of dominion in the forfeited principalities of the Empire; doubt|ful &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, to which the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;eems
<PB N="265" REF="227">
to have very ju&s;t preten&s;ions; and at the &s;ame time a great title not yet di&s;po&s;ed of, and a &s;eat of war on the <HI>Mo&s;elle,</HI> where none of our gene|rals have &s;ignalized them&s;elves. It would be pre|&s;umption to be particular in any propo&s;als on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; it is enough to have &s;hewn in gene|ral, that there are fair opportunities, of which the wi&s;dom of the confederates may make u&s;e.</P>
<P>Common &s;en&s;e will direct us, when we &s;ee &s;o warlike a prince at the head of &s;o great an army <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hovering on the borders of our confederates, ei|ther to obtain his friend&s;hip, or &s;ecure our &s;elves again&s;t the force of his arms. We are &s;ure, whatever numbers of troops we rai&s;e, we &s;hall have no hands but what will turn to account. Nay, we are certain, that extraordinary funds and augmentations for one or two campaigns may &s;pare us the expence of many years, and put an end to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">axes and levies for a whole age; whereas a long par&s;imonious war will drain us of more men and money, and in the end may prove inef|fectual.</P>
<P>There is &s;till a great popular objection, which will be made to every thing that can be urged on this &s;ubject. And indeed it is &s;uch a one as falls &s;o much in with the prejudices and little pa&s;&s;ions of the multitude, that when it is turned and &s;et off to advantage by ill-de&s;igning men, it throws a damp on the publick &s;pirit of the nation, and gives a check to all generous re&s;olutions for its honour and &s;afety. In &s;hort, we are to be told, that <HI>England</HI> contributes much more than any other of the Allies, and that therefore it is not rea&s;onable &s;he &s;hould make any addition to her pre&s;ent efforts. If this were true in fact, I do
<PB N="266" REF="228">
not &s;ee any tolerable colour for &s;uch a conclu|&s;ion. Suppo&s;ing among a multitude embarqued in the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el, there are &s;everal that in the fu|ry of a tempe&s;t will rather peri&s;h than work for their pre&s;ervation; would it not be madne&s;s in the re&s;t to &s;tand idle, and rather chu&s;e to &s;ink toge|ther than do more than comes to their &s;hare? Since we are engaged in a work &s;o ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary for our welfare, the remi&s;sne&s;s of our Al|lies &s;hould be an argument for us to redouble our endeavours rather than &s;lacken them. If we mu&s;t govern our &s;elves by example, let us rather imi|tate the vigilance and activity of the common enemy, than the &s;upinene&s;s and negligence of our friends.</P>
<P>We have indeed a much greater &s;hare in the war than any other part of the confederacy. The <HI>French</HI> King makes at us directly, keeps a King by him to &s;et over us, and hath very lately aug|mented the &s;alary of his court, to let us &s;ee how much he hath that de&s;ign at his heart. Few of the nations in war with him, &s;hould they ever fall into his hands, would lo&s;e their religion or form of government, or interfere at pre&s;ent with him in matters of commerce. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> who are likely to be the greate&s;t lo&s;ers after the <HI>Bri|tains,</HI> have but little trade to the <HI>Levant</HI> in com|pari&s;on with ours, have no con&s;iderable planta|tions or commerce in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> or any woollen-manufactures for <HI>Spain</HI>; not to men|tion the &s;trong barrier they have already purcha|&s;ed between <HI>France</HI> and their own country.</P>
<P>But after all, every nation in the confedera|cy makes the &s;ame complaint, and fancies it &s;elf the greate&s;t &s;ufferer by the war. Indeed in
<PB N="267" REF="229">
to common a pre&s;&s;ure, let the weight be never &s;o equally di&s;tributed, every one will be mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of that part which lies on his own &s;houlders. We furni&s;h, without di&s;pute, more than any other branch of the Alliance: but the que&s;tion is, whether others do not exert them|&s;elves in proportion according to their re&s;pective &s;trength. The Emperor, the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> the Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> as well as the States of <HI>Holland</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> &s;eem at lea&s;t to come up to us. The greate&s;t powers in <HI>Germa|ny</HI> are borrowing mony where they can get it, in order to maintain their &s;tated Quota's, and go thorough their part of the expence: and if any of the Circles have been negligent, they have paid for it much more in their late contributions, than what would have furni&s;hed out their &s;hares in the common charges of the war.</P>
<P>There are others who will object the poverty of the nation, and the difficulties it would find in furni&s;hing greater &s;upplies to the war than it doth at pre&s;ent. To this we might an&s;wer, that if the nation were really as poor as this ob|jection makes it, it &s;hould be an argument for en|forcing rather than dimini&s;hing our pre&s;ent efforts again&s;t <HI>France.</HI> The &s;inking our taxes for a few years would be only a temporary relief, and in a little time occa&s;ion far greater impo&s;itions, than tho&s;e which are now laid upon us. Whereas the &s;ea&s;onable expence of part of our riches, will not only pre&s;erve the re&s;t; but by the right u&s;e of them procure va&s;t additions to our pre&s;ent &s;tock. It may be nece&s;&s;ary for a per&s;on lan|gui&s;hing under an ill habit of body to lo&s;e &s;everal ounces of blood, notwith&s;tanding it will weaken
<PB N="268" REF="230">
him for a time, in order to put a new ferment into the remaining ma&s;s, and draw into it fre&s;h &s;upplies.</P>
<P>But we can by no means make this conce&s;&s;ion, to tho&s;e who &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly publi&s;h the nation's poverty. Our country is not only rich, but abounds in wealth much more than any other of the &s;ame extent in <HI>Europe. France,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding the goodne&s;s of its climate, the fertility of its &s;oil, the multitude of its inhabitants, its convenient harbours, both for the <HI>Ocean</HI> and <HI>Me|diterranean,</HI> and its pre&s;ent corre&s;pondence with the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> is not to compare with <HI>Great Britain</HI> in this particular. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe word for word the pa&s;&s;age of a late celebrated <HI>French</HI> Author, which will lay this matter in its full light; and leave the Reader to make the counter-part of the parallel between the two na|tions.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">According to all the inquiries that I have been able to make during &s;everal years, in which I have applied my &s;elf to this &s;ort of remarks, I have ob&s;erved, that about a tenth part of the people of this kingdom are reduced to begga|ry, and are actual beggars. That among the nine other parts, five are not in a condition to give alms or relief to tho&s;e aforementioned, being very near reduced them&s;elves to the &s;ame mi&s;erable condition. Of the four other remain|ing parts, three are very unea&s;y in their cir|cum&s;tances, and embarra&s;&s;ed with debts and law-&s;uits. In the tenth part, I reckon the Sol|diers, Lawyers, Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, Merchants and &s;ub&s;tantial Citizens, which cannot make up more than a hundred thou&s;and families. And
<PB N="269" REF="231">
I believe I &s;hould not be mi&s;taken, if I &s;hould &s;ay, that there are not above ten thou&s;and of the&s;e families, who are very much at their ea&s;e: and if out of the&s;e ten thou&s;and we &s;hould take the men that are employed in publick bu&s;ine&s;s, with their dependents and adherents, as al&s;o tho&s;e whom the King &s;upports by his boun|ty, with a few Merchants, the number of tho&s;e who remain will be &s;urprizingly little.</Q>
<HI>Dixme Royale.</HI></P>
<P>What a dreadful account is this of nineteen millions of people; for &s;o many the author rec|kons in that kingdom. How can we &s;ee &s;uch a multitude of &s;ouls ca&s;t under &s;o many &s;ubdivi|&s;ions of mi&s;ery, without reflecting on the ab&s;ur|dity of a form of government that &s;acrifices the ea&s;e and happine&s;s of &s;o many rea&s;onable Beings to the glory of one of their fellow-creatures? But this is not our affair at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>If we run over the other nations of <HI>Europe</HI> that have any part in the pre&s;ent war, we &s;hall only pa&s;s through &s;o many different &s;cenes of po|verty. <HI>Spain, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Savoy</HI> are reduced to great extremities. <HI>Germany</HI> is exhau&s;ted to the la&s;t degree in many parts of it, and in others plundered of all &s;he had left. <HI>Holland</HI> indeed flouri&s;hes above the re&s;t in wealth and plenty: but if we con&s;ider the infinite indu&s;try and penu|riou&s;ne&s;s of that people, the coar&s;ene&s;s of their food and raiment, their little indulgences of plea|&s;ure and exce&s;s, it is no wonder that notwith|&s;tanding they furni&s;h as great taxes as their neigh|bours, they make a better figure under them. In a common wealth there are not &s;o many over|grown e&s;tates as in monarchies, the wealth of the
<PB N="270" REF="232">
country is &s;o equally di&s;tributed, that mo&s;t of the community are at their ea&s;e, though few are placed in extraordinary points of &s;plendor and magnificence. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances may very much contribute to the &s;eem|ing pro&s;perity of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> we know they are indebted many millions more than their whole republick is worth, and if we con&s;ider the variety of taxes and impo&s;itions they groan under at a time when their private di&s;&s;entions run high, and &s;ome of the wealthie&s;t parts of the government refu&s;e to bear their &s;hare in the pub|lick expence, we &s;hall not think the condition of that people &s;o much to be envied as &s;ome among&s;t us would willingly repre&s;ent it.</P>
<P>Nor is <HI>Great Britain</HI> only rich as &s;he &s;tands in compari&s;on with other States, but is really &s;o in her own intrin&s;ick wealth. She had never more &s;hips at &s;ea, greater quantities of merchandi&s;e in her warehou&s;es, larger receipts of cu&s;toms, or more numerous commodities ri&s;ing out of her manufactures than &s;he has at pre&s;ent. In &s;hort, &s;he &s;its in the mid&s;t of a mighty affluence of all the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life. If our &s;ilver and gold dimini&s;hes, our publick credit con|tinues unimpaired, and if we are in want of bul|lion, it lies in our own power to &s;upply our &s;elves. The old <HI>Roman</HI> General, when he heard his ar|my complain of thir&s;t, &s;hewed them the &s;prings and rivers that lay behind the enemy's camp. It is our own ca&s;e: the rout of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> army would make us ma&s;ters of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>If Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> takes upon him the com|mand of the confederate forces in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and meets with that &s;upport from the alliance
<PB N="271" REF="233">
which they are capable of giving him, we have a fair pro&s;pect of reducing <HI>Spain</HI> to the entire obe|dience of the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> The <HI>Sile&s;ian</HI> fund (to the immortal reputation of tho&s;e generous pa|triots who were concerned in it) enabled that Prince to make a conque&s;t of <HI>Italy,</HI> at a time when our affairs were more de&s;perate there, than they are at pre&s;ent in the kingdom of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>When our Parliament has done their utmo&s;t, another publick-&s;pirited project of the &s;ame na|ture, which the common enemy could not fore|&s;ee nor prepare again&s;t, might in all probability &s;et King <HI>Charles</HI> upon the throne for which he hath &s;o long contended. One pitched battle would determine the fate of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> continent.</P>
<P>Let us therefore exert the united &s;trength of our whole I&s;land, and by that means put a new life and &s;pirit into the confederates, who have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir eyes fixed upon us, and will abate or increa&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir preparations according to the example that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;et them. We &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of an aug|mentation if we intend to bring the enemy to rea|&s;on, or re&s;cue our country from the mi&s;eries that may befall it; and we find our &s;elves in a condition of making &s;uch an augmentation as, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, cannot but prove effectual. If we carry it on vigorou&s;ly, we &s;hall gain for our &s;elves and our po&s;terity a long, a glorious and a la&s;ting peace; but if we neglect &s;o fair an opportunity, we may be willing to employ all our hands, and all our trea&s;ures, when it will be too late; and &s;hall be tormented with one of the mo&s;t melancholy reflexions of an afflicted heart, That it was once in our power to have made our &s;elves and our children happy.</P>

<P N="2">II. There are many rea&s;ons, why you &s;hould not expect that matters of &s;uch a wonderful na|ture &s;hould be taken notice of by tho&s;e eminent <HI>Pagan</HI> writers, who were contemporaries with <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> or by tho&s;e who lived before his Di&s;ciples had per&s;onally appeared among them, and a&s;certained the report which had gone abroad concerning a life &s;o full of miracles.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing &s;uch things had happened at this day in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> or among the <HI>Gri&s;ons,</HI> who make a gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter figure in <HI>Europe</HI> than <HI>Judaea</HI> did in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, would they be immediately be|lieved by tho&s;e who live at a great di&s;tance from them? or would any certain account of them be tran&s;mitted into foreign countries, within &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time as that of our Saviour's pub|lick mini&s;try? Such kinds of news, though never &s;o true, &s;eldom gain credit, till &s;ome time after they are tran&s;acted and expo&s;ed to the examina|tion of the curious, who by laying together cir|cum&s;tances, atte&s;tations, and characters of tho&s;e who are concerned in them, either receive or re|ject what at fir&s;t none but eye-witne&s;&s;es could ab|&s;olutely
<PB N="277" REF="237">
believe or disbelieve. In a ca&s;e of this &s;ort, it was natural for men of &s;en&s;e and learn|ing to treat the whole account as fabulous, or at farthe&s;t to &s;u&s;pend their belief of it, until all things &s;tood together in their full light.</P>
<P N="3">III. Be&s;ides, the <HI>Jews</HI> were branded not only for &s;uper&s;titions different from all the religions of the <HI>Pagan</HI> world, but in a particular manner ridiculed for being a credulous people; &s;o that whatever reports of &s;uch a nature came out of that country, were looked upon by the heathen world as fal&s;e, frivolous, and improbable.</P>
<P N="4">IV. We may further ob&s;erve that the ordina|ry practice of Magic in tho&s;e times, with the ma|ny pretended Prodigies, Divinations, Apparitions, and local Miracles among the Heathens, made them le&s;s attentive to &s;uch news from <HI>Judaea,</HI> till they had time to con&s;ider the nature, the occa&s;ion, and the end of our Saviour's miracles, and were awakened by many &s;urprizing events to allow them any con&s;ideration at all.</P>
<P N="5">V. We are indeed told by St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> that the fame of our Saviour, during his life, went throughout all <HI>Syria,</HI> and that there followed him great multitudes of people from <HI>Galilee, Judaea, Decapolis, Idumaea,</HI> from beyond <HI>Jordan,</HI> and from <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon.</HI> Now had there been any hi&s;torians of tho&s;e times and places, we might have expected to have &s;een in them &s;ome account of tho&s;e wonderful tran&s;actions in <HI>Judaea</HI>; but there is not any &s;ingle Author extant, in any kind, of that age, in any of tho&s;e countries.</P>
<P N="6">VI. How many books have peri&s;hed in which po&s;&s;ibly there might have been mention of our Saviour? Look among the <HI>Romans,</HI> how few of
<PB N="278" REF="238">
their writings are come down to our times? In the &s;pace of two hundred years from our Saviour's birth, when there was &s;uch a multitude of wri|ters in all kinds, how &s;mall is the number of Au|thors that have made their way to the pre&s;ent age?</P>
<P N="7">VII. One authentick Record, and that the mo&s;t authentick heathen Record, we are pretty &s;ure is lo&s;t. I mean the account &s;ent by the Go|vernor of <HI>Judaea,</HI> under whom our Saviour was judged, condemned, and crucified. It was the cu&s;tom in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, as it is to this day in all the governments of the world, for the praefects and vice-roys of di&s;tant provinces to tran&s;mit to their Soveraign a &s;ummary relation of every thing remarkable in their admini&s;tration. That <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> in his account, would have touched on &s;o extraordinary an event in <HI>Judaea,</HI> is not to be doubted; and that he actually did, we learn from <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr,</HI> who lived about a hundred years after our Saviour's death, re&s;i|ded, made Converts, and &s;uffered martyrdom at <HI>Rome,</HI> where he was engaged with Philo&s;ophers, and in a particular manner with <HI>Cre&s;cens</HI> the <HI>Cynick,</HI> who could ea&s;ily have detected, and would not fail to have expo&s;ed him, had he quo|ted a Record not in being, or made any fal&s;e cita|tion out of it. Would the great Apologi&s;t have challenged <HI>Cre&s;cens</HI> to di&s;pute the cau&s;e of Chri|&s;tianity with him before the <HI>Roman</HI> Senate, had he forged &s;uch an evidence? or would <HI>Cre&s;cens</HI> have refu&s;ed the challenge, could he have trium|phed over him in the detection of &s;uch a forgery? To which we mu&s;t add, that the Apology, which appeals to this Record, was pre&s;ented to a learn|ed Emperor, and to the whole body of the <HI>Ro|man</HI>
<PB N="279" REF="239">
Senate. This father in his apology, &s;peak|ing of the death and &s;uffering of our Saviour, re|fers the Emperor for the truth of what he &s;ays to the acts of <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> which I have here mentioned. <HI>Tertullian,</HI> who wrote his Apology about fifty years after <HI>Ju&s;tin,</HI> doubtle&s;s referred to the &s;ame Record, when he tells the Governor of <HI>Rome,</HI> that the Emperor <HI>Tiberius</HI> having recei|ved an account out of <HI>Pale&s;tine</HI> in <HI>Syria</HI> of the Divine per&s;on who had appeared in that country, paid him a particular regard, and threatned to puni&s;h any who &s;hould accu&s;e the chri&s;tians; nay, that the Emperor would have adopted him among the Deities whom they wor&s;hipped, had not the Senate refu&s;ed to come into his pro|po&s;al. <HI>Tertullian,</HI> who gives us this hi&s;tory, was not only one of the mo&s;t learned men of his age, but, what adds a greater weight to his au|thority in this ca&s;e, was eminently skilful and well read in the laws of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. Nor can it be &s;aid, that <HI>Tertullian</HI> grounded his quotation upon the authority of <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr,</HI> be|cau&s;e we find he mixes it with matters of fact which are not related by that Author. <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> mentions the &s;ame ancient Record, but as it was not extant in his time, I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon his authority in this point. If it be objected that this particular is not mentioned in any <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torian, I &s;hall u&s;e the &s;ame argument in a pa|rallel ca&s;e, and &s;ee whether it will carry any force with it. <HI>Ulpian</HI> the great <HI>Roman</HI> Lawyer gather|ed together all the Imperial Edicts that had been made again&s;t the chri&s;tians. But did any one ever &s;ay that there had been no &s;uch Edicts, be|cau&s;e they were not mentioned in the hi&s;tories of
<PB N="280" REF="240">
tho&s;e Emperors? Be&s;ides, who knows but this circum&s;tance of <HI>Tiberius</HI> was mentioned in o|ther hi&s;torians that have been lo&s;t, though not to be found in any &s;till extant? Has not <HI>Suetoni|us</HI> many particulars of this Emperor omitted by <HI>Tacitus,</HI> and <HI>Herodian</HI> many that are not &s;o much as hinted at by either? As for the &s;purious <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Pilate,</HI> now extant, we know the occa|&s;ion and time of their writing, and that had there not been a true and authentick Record of this nature, they would never have been forged.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The &s;tory of <HI>Agbarus</HI> King of <HI>Ede&s;&s;a,</HI> relating to the letter which he &s;ent to our Saviour, and to that which he received from him, is a re|cord of great authority; and though I will not in|&s;i&s;t upon it, may venture to &s;ay, that had we &s;uch an evidence for any fact in <HI>Pagan</HI> hi&s;tory, an Au|thor would be thought very unrea&s;onable who &s;hould reject it. I believe you will be of my o|pinion, if you will peru&s;e, with other Authors, who have appeared in vindication of the&s;e letters as genuine, the additional arguments which have been made u&s;e of by the late famous and learned Dr. <HI>Grabe,</HI> in the &s;econd volume of his <HI>Spicile|gium.</HI></P>

Such particulars are mo&s;t of the&s;e which follow, and which are all atte&s;ted by &s;ome one or other of tho&s;e heathen Authors, who lived in or near the age of our Saviour and his di&s;ciples. <HI>That</HI> Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar <HI>had ordered the whole em|pire to be cen&s;ed or taxed,</HI> which brought our Sa|viour's reputed parents to <HI>Bethlehem:</HI> This is mentioned by &s;everal <HI>Roman</HI> hi&s;torians, as <HI>Taci|tus,
<PB N="282" REF="242">
Suetonius,</HI> and <HI>Dion. That a great light or a new &s;tar appeared in the ea&s;t, which directed the wi&s;e men to our Saviour:</HI> This is recorded by <HI>Chalcidius. That</HI> Herod, <HI>the King of</HI> Pa|le&s;tine, <HI>&s;o often mentioned in the</HI> Roman <HI>hi&s;tory, made a great &s;laughter of innocent children,</HI> be|ing &s;o jealous of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, that he put to death his own &s;ons on that account: This cha|racter of him is given by &s;everal hi&s;torians, and this cruel fact mentioned by <HI>Macrobius,</HI> a heathen Author, who tells it as a known thing, without any mark of doubt upon it. <HI>That our Saviour had been in</HI> Egypt: This <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> though he rai&s;es a mon&s;trous &s;tory upon it, is &s;o far from denying, that he tells us our Saviour learned the arts of magic in that country. <HI>That</HI> Pontius Pilate <HI>was Governor of</HI> Judaea, <HI>that our Saviour was brought in judgment before him, and by him condemned and crucified:</HI> This is recorded by <HI>Tacitus. That many miraculous cures and works out of the ordinary cour&s;e of nature were wrought by him:</HI> This is confe&s;&s;ed by <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo&s;tate, <HI>Por|phyry,</HI> and <HI>Hierocles,</HI> all of them not only <HI>Pa|gans,</HI> but profe&s;&s;ed enemies and per&s;ecutors of Chri&s;tianity. <HI>That our Saviour foretold &s;everal things, which came to pa&s;s according to his predi|ctions:</HI> This was atte&s;ted by <HI>Phlegon</HI> in his an|nals, as we are a&s;&s;ured by the learned <HI>Origen</HI> again&s;t <HI>Cel&s;us. That at the time when our Saviour died, there was a miraculous darkne&s;s and a great earthquake:</HI> This is recorded by the &s;ame <HI>Phlegon</HI> the <HI>Trallian,</HI> who was likewi&s;e a <HI>Pagan</HI> and Freeman to <HI>Adrian</HI> the Emperor. We may here ob&s;erve, that a native of <HI>Trallium,</HI> which was not &s;ituate at &s;o great a di&s;tance from <HI>Pale|&s;tine,</HI>
<PB N="283" REF="243">
might very probably be informed of &s;uch remarkable events as had pa&s;&s;ed among the <HI>Jews</HI> in the age immediately preceding his own times, &s;ince &s;everal of his countrymen with whom he had conver&s;ed, might have received a confu&s;ed report of our Saviour before his crucifixion, and probably lived within the Shake of the earth|quake, and the Shadow of the eclip&s;e, which are recorded by this Author. <HI>That</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>was wor|&s;hipped as a God among the Chri&s;tians; that they would rather &s;uffer death than bla&s;pheme him; that they received a &s;acrament, and by it entered into a vow of ab&s;taining from &s;in and wickedne&s;s,</HI> conformable to the advice given by St. <HI>Paul; that they had private a&s;&s;emblies of wor&s;hip, and u&s;ed to join together in Hymns</HI>: This is the account which <HI>Pliny</HI> the younger gives of Chri&s;tianity in his days, about &s;eventy years after the death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and which agrees in all its circum&s;tances with the accounts we have in holy writ, of the fir&s;t &s;tate of Chri&s;tianity after the crucifixion of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. <HI>That St.</HI> Peter, <HI>who&s;e mi|racles are many of them recorded in holy writ, did many wonderful works,</HI> is owned by <HI>Julian</HI> the apo&s;tate, who therefore repre&s;ents him as a great Magician, and one who had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a book of magical &s;ecrets left him by our Saviour. <HI>That the devils or evil &s;pirits were &s;ubject to them,</HI> we may learn from <HI>Porphyry,</HI> who objects to Chri&s;tianity, that &s;ince <HI>Je&s;us</HI> had begun to be wor&s;hipped, <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> and the re&s;t of the gods did no more conver&s;e with men. Nay, <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> him&s;elf affirms the &s;ame thing in effect, when he &s;ays, that the power which &s;eemed to re&s;ide in Chri&s;tians, proceeded from the u&s;e of certain
<PB N="284" REF="244">
names, and the invocation of certain daemons. <HI>Origen</HI> remarks on this pa&s;&s;age, that the Author doubtle&s;s hints at tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who put to flight evil &s;pirits, and healed tho&s;e who were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with them; a fact which had been often &s;een, and which he him&s;elf had &s;een, as he de|clares in another part of his di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t <HI>Cel|&s;us.</HI> But at the &s;ame time he a&s;&s;ures us, that this miraculous power was exerted by the u&s;e of no other name but that of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to which were ad|ded &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in his hi&s;tory, but nothing like any invocation to <HI>Daemons.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> was &s;o hard &s;et with the report of our Saviour's miracles, and the confident atte|&s;tations concerning him, that though he often in|timates he did not believe them to be true, yet knowing he might be &s;ilenced in &s;uch an an&s;wer, provides him&s;elf with another retreat, when beat|ed out of this; namely, that our Saviour was a magician. Thus he compares the feeding of &s;o many thou&s;ands at two different times with a few loaves and fi&s;hes, to the magical fea&s;ts of tho&s;e <HI>Egyptian</HI> impo&s;tors, who would pre&s;ent their &s;pe|ctators with vi&s;ionary entertainments that had in them neither &s;ub&s;tance nor reality: which, by the way, is to &s;uppo&s;e, that a hungry and fainting multitude were filled by an apparition, or &s;trength|ned and refre&s;hed with &s;hadows. He knew very well that there were &s;o many witne&s;&s;es and actors, if I may call them &s;uch, in the&s;e two miracles, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to refute &s;uch multitudes, who had doubtle&s;s &s;ufficiently &s;pread the fame of them, and was therefore in this place forced to re|&s;ort to the other &s;olution, that it was done by ma|gic. It was not enough to &s;ay that a miracle
<PB N="285" REF="245">
which appeared to &s;o many thou&s;and eye-witne&s;|&s;es was a forgery of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s di&s;ciples, and there|fore &s;uppo&s;ing them to be eye-witne&s;&s;es, he en|deavours to &s;hew how they might be deceived.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The unconverted heathens, who were pre&s;&s;ed by the many authorities that confirmed our Saviour's miracles, as well as the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> who had actually &s;een them, were driven to account for them after the &s;ame manner: For, to work by magic in the heathen way of &s;peak|ing, was in the language of the <HI>Jews</HI> to ca&s;t out devils by <HI>Beelzebub</HI> the Prince of the devils. Our Saviour, who knew that unbelievers in all ages would put this perver&s;e interpretation on his miracles, has branded the malignity of tho&s;e men, who contrary to the dictates of their own hearts &s;tarted &s;uch an unrea&s;onable objection, as a bla&s;phemy again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, and decla|red not only the guilt, but the puni&s;hment of &s;o black a crime. At the &s;ame time he conde&s;cen|ded to &s;hew the vanity and emptine&s;s of this ob|jection again&s;t his miracles, by repre&s;enting that they evidently tended to the de&s;truction of tho&s;e powers, to who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance the enemies of his doctrine then a&s;cribed them. An argument, which, if duly weighed, renders the objection &s;o very fri|volous and groundle&s;s, that we may venture to call it even bla&s;phemy again&s;t common &s;en&s;e. Would Magic endeavour to draw off the minds of men from the wor&s;hip which was paid to &s;tocks and &s;tones, to give them an abhorrence of tho&s;e e|vil &s;pirits who rejoiced in the mo&s;t cruel &s;acrifi|ces, and in offerings of the greate&s;t impurity; and in &s;hort to call upon mankind to exert their whole &s;trength in the love and adoration of that
<PB N="286" REF="246">
one Being, from whom they derived their exi&s;t|ence, and on whom only they were taught to de|pend every moment for the happine&s;s and conti|nuance of it? Was it the bu&s;ine&s;s of magic to hu|manize our natures with compa&s;&s;ion, forgivene&s;s, and all the in&s;tances of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive cha|rity? Would evil &s;pirits contribute to make men &s;ober, cha&s;te, and temperate, and in a word to pro|duce that reformation, which was wrought in the moral world by tho&s;e doctrines of our Savi|our, that received their &s;anction from his miracles? Nor is it po&s;&s;ible to imagine, that evil &s;pirits would enter into a combination with our Saviour to cut off all their corre&s;pondence and intercour&s;e with mankind, and to prevent any for the future from addicting them&s;elves to tho&s;e rites and ceremonies, which had done them &s;o much ho|nour. We &s;ee the early effect which Chri&s;tianity had on the minds of men in this particular, by that number of books, which were filled with the &s;ecrets of magic, and made a &s;acrifice to Chri&s;tianity by the converts mentioned in the <HI>Acts</HI> of the Apo&s;tles. We have likewi&s;e an emi|nent in&s;tance of the incon&s;i&s;tency of our Religion with magic, in the hi&s;tory of the famous <HI>Aqui|la.</HI> This Per&s;on, who was a kin&s;man of the Emperor <HI>Trajan,</HI> and likewi&s;e a man of great learning, notwith&s;tanding he had embraced Chri|&s;tianity, could not be brought off from the &s;tudies of magic, by the repeated admonitions of his fel|low-chri&s;tians: &s;o that at length they expelled him their &s;ociety, as rather chu&s;ing to lo&s;e the reputation of &s;o con&s;iderable a Pro&s;elyte, than communicate with one who dealt in &s;uch dark and infernal practices. Be&s;ides we may ob&s;erve,
<PB N="287" REF="247">
that all the favourers of magic were the mo&s;t pro|fe&s;t and bitter enemies to the chri&s;tian religion. Not to mention <HI>Simon Magus</HI> and many others, I &s;hall only take notice of tho&s;e two great per&s;e|cutors of chri&s;tianity, the Emperors <HI>Adrian</HI> and <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo&s;tate, both them initiated in the my&s;teries of divination, and skilled in all the depths of magic. I &s;hall only add, that evil &s;pi|rits cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have concurred in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a religion which triumphed over them, drove them out of the places they po&s;&s;e&s;t, and dive&s;ted them of their influence on man|kind: nor would I mention this particular, though it be unanimou&s;ly reported by all the ancient chri&s;tian Authors; did it not appear from the authorities above-cited, that this was a fact con|fe&s;t by heathens them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="5">V. We now &s;ee what a multitude of <HI>Pagan</HI> te&s;timonies may be produced for all tho&s;e remark|able pa&s;&s;ages, which might have been expected from them: and indeed of &s;everal, that, I believe, do more than an&s;wer your expectation, as they were not &s;ubjects in their own nature &s;o expo&s;ed to publick notoriety. It cannot be expected they &s;hould mention particulars, which were tran&s;|acted among&s;t the Di&s;ciples only, or among &s;ome few even of the Di&s;ciples them&s;elves; &s;uch as the transfiguration, the agony in the garden, the ap|pearance of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> after his re&s;urrection, and o|thers of the like nature. It was impo&s;&s;ible for a heathen author to relate the&s;e things; becau&s;e if he had believed them, he would no longer have been a heathen, and by that means his te&s;timony would not have been thought of &s;o much vali|dity. Be&s;ides, his very report of facts &s;o favou|rable
<PB N="288" REF="248">
to Chri&s;tianity would have prompted men to &s;ay that he was probably tainted with their doctrine. We have a parallel ca&s;e in <HI>Hecataeus,</HI> a famous <HI>Greek</HI> Hi&s;torian, who had &s;everal pa&s;|&s;ages in his book conformable to the hi&s;tory of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> writers, which when quoted by <HI>Jo&s;e|phus,</HI> as a confirmation of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> hi&s;tory, when his heathen adver&s;aries could give no other an&s;wer to it, they would need &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>He|cataeus</HI> was a <HI>Jew</HI> in his heart, though they had no other rea&s;on for it, but becau&s;e his hi&s;tory gave greater authority to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> than the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Records.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. TO this li&s;t of heathen writers, who make mention of our Saviour, or touch upon any particulars of his life, I &s;hall add tho&s;e Authors who were at fir&s;t heathens, and after|wards concerted to Chri&s;tianity; upon which ac|count, as I &s;hall here &s;hew, their te&s;timonies are to be looked upon as the more authentick. And in this li&s;t of evidences, I &s;hall confine my &s;elf to &s;uch learned <HI>Pagans</HI> as came over to Chri&s;tianity in the three fir&s;t centuries, becau&s;e tho&s;e were the times in which men had the be&s;t means of infor|ming them&s;elves of the truth of our Saviour's hi|&s;tory, and becau&s;e among the great number of Philo&s;ophers who came in afterwards, under the reigns of chri&s;tian Emperors, there might be &s;eve|ral who did it partly out of worldly motives.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us now &s;uppo&s;e, that a learned heathen writer who lived within 60 years of our Savi|our's crucifixion, after having &s;hewn that fal&s;e mi|racles were generally wrought in ob&s;curity, and before few or no witne&s;&s;es, &s;peaking of tho&s;e which were wrought by our Saviour, has the fol|lowing pa&s;&s;age.
<Q REND="margQuotes">But his works were always &s;een, becau&s;e they were true, they were &s;een by tho&s;e who were healed, and by tho&s;e who were rai&s;ed from the dead. Nay the&s;e per&s;ons who were thus healed, and rai&s;ed, were &s;een not only at the time of their being healed, and rai&s;ed, but long afterwards. Nay they were &s;een not only all the while our Saviour was upon earth, but &s;urvived after his departure out of
<PB N="290" REF="250">
this world, nay &s;ome of them were living in our days.</Q></P>
<P N="3">III. I dare &s;ay you would look upon this as a glorious atte&s;tation for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, had it come from the hand of a famous <HI>Atheni|an</HI> Philo&s;opher. The&s;e forementioned words however are actually the words of one who lived about &s;ixty Years after our Saviour's crucifixion, and was a famous Philo&s;opher in <HI>Athens:</HI> but it will be &s;aid, he was a convert to Chri&s;tianity. Now con&s;ider this matter impartially, and &s;ee if his te&s;timony is not much more valid for that rea|&s;on. Had he continued a <HI>Pagan</HI> Philo&s;opher, would not the world have &s;aid that he was not &s;incere in what he writ, or did not believe it; for, if &s;o, would not they have told us he would have embraced Chri&s;tianity? This was indeed the ca&s;e of this excellent man: he had &s;o thoroughly examined the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, and the excellency of that religion which he taught, and was &s;o entirely convinced of both, that he be|came a Pro&s;elyte and died a Martyr.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> was an <HI>Athenian</HI> Philo&s;opher, at the &s;ame time, famed for his learning and wi&s;|dom, but converted to Chri&s;tianity. As it can|not be que&s;tioned that he peru&s;ed and approved the apology of <HI>Quadratus,</HI> in which is the pa&s;&s;age ju&s;t now cited, he joined with him in an apolo|gy of his own, to the &s;ame Emperor, on the &s;ame &s;ubject. This apology, tho' now lo&s;t, was extant in the time of <HI>Ado Viennen&s;is, A. D.</HI> 870, and highly e&s;teemed by the mo&s;t learned <HI>Atheni|ans,</HI> as that Author witne&s;&s;es. It mu&s;t have con|tained great arguments for the truth of our Sa|viour's hi&s;tory, becau&s;e in it he a&s;&s;erted the divi|nity
<PB N="291" REF="251">
of our Saviour, which could not but engage him in the proof of his miracles.</P>
<P N="5">V. I do allow that, generally &s;peaking, a man is not &s;o acceptable and unque&s;tioned an evi|dence in facts, which make for the advancement of his own party. But we mu&s;t con&s;ider that, in the ca&s;e before us, the per&s;ons to whom we ap|peal, were of an oppo&s;ite party, till they were per|&s;uaded of the truth of tho&s;e very facts, which they report. They bear evidence to a hi&s;tory in de|fence of Chri&s;tianity, the truth of which hi&s;to|ry was their motive to embrace Chri&s;tianity. They atte&s;t facts which they had heard while they were yet heathens, and had they not found rea|&s;on to believe them, they would &s;till have con|tinued heathens, and have made no mention of them in their writings.</P>
<P N="6">VI. When a man is born under chri&s;tian Parents, and trained up in the profe&s;&s;ion of that religion from a child, he generally guides him&s;elf by the rules of <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith</HI> in believing what is deli|vered by the Evangeli&s;ts; but the learned <HI>Pagans</HI> of antiquity, before they became Chri&s;tians, were only guided by the common rules of <HI>Hi&s;tori|cal Faith:</HI> That is, they examined the nature of the evidence which was to be met with in com|mon fame, tradition, and the writings of tho&s;e per&s;ons who related them, together with the num|ber, concurrence, veracity, and private characters of tho&s;e per&s;ons; and being convinced upon all accounts that they had the &s;ame rea&s;on to believe the hi&s;tory of our Saviour, as that of any other per&s;on to which they them&s;elves were not actual|ly eye-witne&s;&s;es, they were bound by all the rules of hi&s;torical faith, and of right rea&s;on, to give
<PB N="292" REF="252">
credit to this hi&s;tory. This they did accordingly, and in con&s;equence of it publi&s;hed the &s;ame truths them&s;elves, &s;uffered many afflictions, and very often death it &s;elf, in the a&s;&s;ertion of them. When I &s;ay, that an hi&s;torical belief of the acts of our Saviour induced the&s;e learned <HI>Pagans</HI> to em|brace his doctrine, I do not deny that there were many other motives, which conduced to it, as the excellency of his precepts, the fulfilling of prophecies, the miracles of his Di&s;ciples, the ir|reproachable lives and magnanimous &s;ufferings of their followers, with other con&s;iderations of the &s;ame nature: but whatever other collateral arguments wrought more or le&s;s with Philo&s;o|phers of that age, it is certain that a belief in the hi&s;tory of our Saviour was one motive with eve|ry new convert, and that upon which all others turned, as being the very ba&s;is and foundation of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P N="7">VII. To this I mu&s;t further add, that as we have already &s;een many particular facts which are recorded in holy writ, atte&s;ted by particular <HI>Pa|gan</HI> Authors: the te&s;timony of tho&s;e I am now going to produce, extends to the whole hi&s;tory of our Saviour, and to that continued &s;eries of actions, which are related of him and his Di&s;ci|ples in the books of the <HI>New-Te&s;tament.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. This evidently appears from their quo|tations out of the Evangeli&s;ts, for the confirma|tion of any doctrine or account of our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour. Nay a learned man of our nation, who examined the writings of the mo&s;t ancient Fathers in another view, refers to &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Ire|naeus, Tertullian, Clemens</HI> of <HI>Alexandria, Ori|gen,</HI> and <HI>Cyprian,</HI> by which he plainly &s;hows that
<PB N="293" REF="253">
each of the&s;e early writers a&s;cribe to the four E|vangeli&s;ts by name their re&s;pective hi&s;tories; &s;o that there is not the lea&s;t room for doubting of their belief in the hi&s;tory of our Saviour, as recor|ded in the Go&s;pels. I &s;hall add, that three of the five Fathers here mentioned, and probably four, were <HI>Pagans</HI> converted to Chri&s;tianity, as they were all of them very inqui&s;itive and deep in the knowledge of heathen learning and philo&s;ophy.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. IT happened very providentially to the ho|nour of the Chri&s;tian religion, that it did not take its ri&s;e in the dark illiterate ages of the world, but at a time when arts and &s;ciences were at their height, and when there were men who made it the bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives to &s;earch after truth, and &s;ift the &s;everal opinions of Phi|lo&s;ophers
<PB N="294" REF="254">
and wi&s;e men, concerning the duty, the end, and chief happine&s;s of rea&s;onable crea|tures.</P>
<P N="2">II. Several of the&s;e therefore, when they had informed them&s;elves of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, and examined with unprejudiced minds the doctrines and manners of his di&s;ciples and followers, were &s;o &s;truck and convinced, that they profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of that &s;ect; notwith&s;tanding, by this profe&s;&s;ion in that juncture of time, they bid fare|well to all the plea&s;ures of this life, renounced all the views of ambition, engaged in an unin|terrupted cour&s;e of &s;everities, and expo&s;ed them|&s;elves to publick hatred and contempt, to &s;uffer|ings of all kinds, and to death it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="3">III. Of this &s;ort we may reckon tho&s;e three early converts to Chri&s;tianity, who each of them was a member of a Senate famous for its wi&s;dom and learning. <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> the <HI>Arimathean</HI> was of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Sanhedrim, Diony&s;ius</HI> of the <HI>Athenian A|reopagus,</HI> and <HI>Flavius Clemens</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Se|nate; nay at the time of his death Con&s;ul of <HI>Rome.</HI> The&s;e three were &s;o throughly &s;atisfied of the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion, that the fir&s;t of them, according to all the reports of an|tiquity, died a martyr for it; as did the &s;econd, unle&s;s we disbelieve <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> his fellow-citi|zen and contemporary; and the third, as we are informed both by <HI>Roman</HI> and Chri&s;tian Authors.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Among tho&s;e innumerable multitudes, who in mo&s;t of the known nations of the world came over to Chri&s;tianity at its fir&s;t appearance, we may be &s;ure there were great numbers of wi&s;e and learned men, be&s;ide tho&s;e who&s;e names are in the Chri&s;tian records, who without doubt
<PB N="295" REF="255">
took care to examine the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, before they would leave the religion of their country and of their forefathers, for the &s;ake of one that would not only cut them off from the allurements of this world, but &s;ubject them to every thing terrible or di&s;agreeable in it. <HI>Tertullian</HI> tells the <HI>Roman</HI> Governors, that their corporations, councils, armies, tribes, compa|nies, the palace, &s;enate, and courts of judica|ture were filled with Chri&s;tians; as <HI>Arnobius</HI> a&s;|&s;erts, that men of the fine&s;t parts and learning, Orators, Grammarians, Rhetoricians, Lawyers, Phy&s;icians, Philo&s;ophers, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;entiments they had been once fond of, took up their re&s;t in the Chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P N="5">V. Who can imagine that men of this chara|cter did not thoroughly inform them&s;elves of the hi&s;tory of that per&s;on, who&s;e doctrines they em|braced? for however con&s;onant to rea&s;on his pre|cepts appeared, how good &s;oever were the ef|fects which they produced in the world, nothing could have tempted men to acknowledge him as their God and Saviour, but their being firmly per&s;uaded of the miracles he wrought, and the many atte&s;tations of his divine mi&s;&s;ion, which were to be met with in the hi&s;tory of his life. This was the ground-work of the Chri&s;tian re|ligion, and, if this failed, the whole &s;uper&s;tru|cture &s;unk with it. This point therefore, of the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, as recorded by the Evangeli&s;ts, is every where taken for granted in the writings of tho&s;e, who from <HI>Pagan</HI> Philo&s;o|phers became Chri&s;tian Authors, and who, by rea&s;on of their conver&s;ion, are to be looked upon as of the &s;tronge&s;t collateral te&s;timony for the
<PB N="296" REF="256">
truth of what is delivered concerning our Sa|viour.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Be&s;ides innumerable Authors that are lo&s;t, we have the undoubted names, works, or frag|ments of &s;everal <HI>Pagan</HI> Philo&s;ophers, which &s;hew them to have been as learned as any unconverted heathen Authors of the age in which the lived. If we look into the greate&s;t nur&s;eries of learn|ing in tho&s;e ages of the world, we find in <HI>Athens, Diony&s;ius, Quadratus, Ari&s;tides, Athenagoras</HI>; and in <HI>Alexandria, Diony&s;ius, Clemens, Ammo|nius, Arnobius,</HI> and <HI>Anatolius,</HI> to whom we may add <HI>Origen</HI>; for though his father was a Chri&s;tian martyr, he became, without all controver&s;y, the mo&s;t learned and able Philo&s;opher of his age, by his education at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> in that famous &s;emi|nary of arts and &s;ciences.</P>

<P N="1">I. IT now therefore only remains to con&s;ider, whether the&s;e learned men had means and opportunities of informing them&s;elves of the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory; for unle&s;s this point can be made out, their te&s;timonies will ap|pear invalid, and their enquiries ineffectual.</P>
<P N="2">II. As to this point, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that many thou&s;ands had &s;een the tran&s;actions of our Saviour in <HI>Judaea,</HI> and that many hundred thou|&s;ands had received an account of them from the mouths of tho&s;e who were actually eye-witne&s;|&s;es. I &s;hall only mention among the&s;e eye-wit|ne&s;&s;es the twelve Apo&s;tles, to whom we mu&s;t
<PB N="298" REF="258">
add St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who had a particular call to this high office, though many other di&s;ciples and fol|lowers of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had al&s;o their &s;hare in the pub|li&s;hing this wonderful hi&s;tory. We learn from the ancient records of Chri&s;tianity, that many of the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples made it the expre&s;s bu&s;ine&s;s of their lives, travelled into the remo|te&s;t parts of the world, and in all places gathered multitudes about them, to acquaint them with the hi&s;tory and doctrines of their crucified Ma|&s;ter. And indeed, were all Chri&s;tian records of the&s;e proceedings entirely lo&s;t, as many have been, the effect plainly evinces the truth of them; for how el&s;e during the Apo&s;tles lives could Chri&s;tianity have &s;pread it&s;elf with &s;uch an ama|zing progre&s;s through the &s;everal nations of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire? how could it fly like lightning, and carry conviction with it, from one end of the earth to the other?</P>
<P N="3">III. Heathens therefore of every age, &s;ex, and quality, born in the mo&s;t different climates, and bred up under the mo&s;t different in&s;titutions, when they &s;aw men of plain &s;en&s;e, without the help of learning, armed with patience and courage, in|&s;tead of wealth, pomp, or power, expre&s;&s;ing in their lives tho&s;e excellent doctrines of Morality, which they taught as delivered to them from our Saviour, averring that they had &s;een his mi|racles during his life, and conver&s;ed with him af|ter his death; when, I &s;ay, they &s;aw no &s;u&s;picion of fal&s;hood, treachery, or worldly intere&s;t, in their behaviour and conver&s;ation, and that they &s;ubmit|ted to the mo&s;t ignominious and cruel deaths, ra|ther than retract their te&s;timony, or even be &s;i|lent in matters which they were to publi&s;h by their
<PB N="299" REF="259">
Saviour's e&s;pecial command, there was no rea|&s;on to doubt of the veracity of tho&s;e facts which they related, or of the Divine Mi&s;&s;ion in which they were employed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. But even the&s;e motives to Faith in our Sa|viour would not have been &s;ufficient to have brought about in &s;o few years &s;uch an incredible number of conver&s;ions, had not the Apo&s;tles been able to exhibit &s;till greater proofs of the truths which they taught. A few per&s;ons of an odious and de&s;pi&s;ed country could not have filled the world with Believers, had they not &s;hown undoubted credentials from the Divine per&s;on who &s;ent them on &s;uch a me&s;&s;age. According|ly we are a&s;&s;ured, that they were inve&s;ted with the power of working miracles, which was the mo&s;t &s;hort and the mo&s;t convincing argument that could be produced, and the only one that was a|dapted to the rea&s;on of all mankind, to the capa|cities of the wi&s;e and ignorant, and could over|come every cavil and every prejudice. Who would not believe that our Saviour healed the &s;ick, and rai&s;ed the dead, when it was publi&s;hed by tho&s;e who them&s;elves often did the &s;ame mi|racles, in their pre&s;ence, and in his name! Could any rea&s;onable per&s;on imagine, that God Almigh|ty would arm men with &s;uch powers to autho|rize a lye, and e&s;tabli&s;h a religion in the world which was di&s;plea&s;ing to him, or that evil &s;pirits would lend them &s;uch an effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance to beat down vice and idolatry?</P>
<P N="5">V. When the Apo&s;tles had formed many a&s;|&s;emblies in &s;everal parts of the <HI>Pagan</HI> world, who gave credit to the glad tidings of the Go&s;pel, that, upon their departure, the memory of what they
<PB N="300" REF="260">
had related might not peri&s;h, they appointed out of the&s;e new converts, men of the be&s;t &s;en&s;e, and of the mo&s;t unblemi&s;hed lives, to pre&s;ide over the&s;e &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies, and to inculcate with|out cea&s;ing what they had heard from the mouths of the&s;e eye-witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Upon the death of any of tho&s;e &s;ub&s;titutes to the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> his place was filled up with &s;ome other per&s;on of emi|nence for his piety and learning, and generally a member of the &s;ame Church, who after his de|cea&s;e was followed by another in the &s;ame man|ner, by which means the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was continu|ed in an uninterrupted line. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> informs us, that every church pre&s;erved a catalogue of its Bi&s;hops in the order that they &s;ucceeded one a|nother, and (for an example) produces a cata|logue of tho&s;e who governed the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in that character, which contains eight or nine per&s;ons, though but at a very &s;mall remove from the times of the Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>Indeed the li&s;ts of Bi&s;hops, which are come down to us in other churches, are generally filled with greater numbers than one would expect. But the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was quick in the three fir&s;t centuries, becau&s;e the Bi&s;hop very often ended in the Martyr: for when a per&s;ecution aro&s;e in any place, the fir&s;t fury of it fell upon this Order of holy men, who abundantly te&s;tified by their Deaths and Sufferings that they did not under|take the&s;e offices out of any temporal views, that they were &s;incere and &s;atisfied in the belief of what they taught, and that they firmly adhe|red to what they had received from the Apo&s;tles, as laying down their lives in the &s;ame hope, and upon the &s;ame principles. None can be &s;uppo|&s;ed
<PB N="301" REF="261">
&s;o utterly regardle&s;s of their own happine&s;s as to expire in torment, and hazard their Eter|nity, to &s;upport any fables and inventions of their own, or any forgeries of their predece&s;&s;ors who had pre&s;ided in the &s;ame church, and which might have been ea&s;ily detected by the tradi|tion of that particular church, as well as by the concurring te&s;timony of others. To this purpo&s;e, I think it is very remarkable, that there was not a &s;ingle Martyr among tho&s;e many Hereticks, who di&s;agreed with the Apo&s;tolical church, and intro|duced &s;everal wild and ab&s;urd notions into the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity. They dur&s;t not &s;take their pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s on their own chimerical imaginations, and did not only &s;hun per&s;ecution, but affirmed that it was unnece&s;&s;ary for their followers to bear their religion through &s;uch fiery tryals.</P>
<P N="7">VII. We may fairly reckon, that this fir&s;t age of Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples, with that &s;econd gene|ration of many who were their immediate con|verts, extended it&s;elf to the middle of the &s;econd Century, and that &s;everal of the third generation from the&s;e la&s;t mentioned, which was but the fifth from <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> continued to the end of the third Century. Did we know the ages and numbers of the members in every particular church, which was planted by the Apo&s;tles, I doubt not but in mo&s;t of them there might be found five per&s;ons who in a continued &s;eries would reach through the&s;e three centuries of years, that is till the 265th from the death of our Saviour.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Among the accounts of tho&s;e very few out of innumerable multitudes, who had embra|ced Chri&s;tianity, I &s;hall &s;ingle out four per&s;ons, eminent for their lives, their writings, and their

&s;ufferings, that were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively contemporaries, and bring us down as far as to the year of our Lord 254. St. <HI>John,</HI> who was the beloved Di|&s;ciple, and conver&s;ed the mo&s;t intimately with our Saviour, lived till <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 100. <HI>Poly|carp,</HI> who was the Di&s;ciple of St. <HI>John,</HI> and had conver&s;ed with others of the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ci|ples of our Lord, lived till <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 167, though his life was &s;hortened by martyrdom. <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> who was the Di&s;ciple of <HI>Polycarp,</HI> and had con|ver&s;ed with many of the immediate Di&s;ciples of the Apo&s;tles, lived, at the lowe&s;t computation of his age, till the year 202, when he was likewi&s;e cut off by martyrdom; in which year the great <HI>Origen</HI> was appointed Regent of the Catechetick &s;chool in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and as he was the miracle of that age, for indu&s;try, learning and philo&s;o|phy, he was looked upon as the champion of Chri&s;tianity, till the year 254, when, if he did not &s;uffer martyrdom, as &s;ome think he did, he was certainly actuated by the &s;pirit of it, as ap|pears in the whole cour&s;e of his life and writings; nay, he had often been put to the torture, and had undergone tryals wor&s;e than death. As he con|ver&s;ed with the mo&s;t eminent Chri&s;tians of his time in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and in the Ea&s;t, brought over multitudes both from here&s;y and heatheni&s;m, and left behind him &s;everal Di&s;ciples of great fame and learning, there is no que&s;tion but there were con&s;iderable numbers of tho&s;e who knew him, and had been his hearers, &s;cholars, or pro&s;elytes, that lived till the end of the third century, and to the reign of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great.</P>
<P N="9">IX. It is evident to tho&s;e, who read the lives and writings of <HI>Polycarp, Irenaeus,</HI> and <HI>Origen,</HI> that the&s;e three Fathers believed the accounts

which are given of our Saviour in the four Evan|geli&s;ts, and had undoubted arguments that not only St. <HI>John,</HI> but many others of our Saviour's di&s;ciples, publi&s;hed the &s;ame accounts of him. To which we mu&s;t &s;ubjoin this further remark, that what was believed by the&s;e Fathers on this &s;ub|ject, was likewi&s;e the belief of the main body of Chri&s;tians in tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages when they flou|ri&s;hed; &s;ince <HI>Polycarp</HI> cannot but be looked up|on, if we con&s;ider the re&s;pect that was paid him, as the repre&s;entative of the Ea&s;tern Churches in this particular, <HI>Irenaeus</HI> of the We&s;tern upon the &s;ame account, and <HI>Origen</HI> of tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. To the&s;e I might add <HI>Paul</HI> the famous her|mite, who retired from the <HI>Decian</HI> per&s;ecution five or &s;ix years before <HI>Origen</HI>'s death, and lived till the year 343. I have only di&s;covered one of tho&s;e channels by which the hi&s;tory of our Savi|our might be conveyed pure and unadulterated, through tho&s;e &s;everal ages that produced tho&s;e <HI>Pagan</HI> Philo&s;ophers, who&s;e te&s;timonies I make u&s;e of for the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory. Some or other of the&s;e Philo&s;ophers came into the Chri&s;tian faith during its infancy, in the &s;eve|ral periods of the&s;e three fir&s;t centuries, when they had &s;uch means of informing them&s;elves in all the particulars of our Saviour's hi&s;tory. I mu&s;t fur|ther add, that though I have here only cho&s;en this &s;ingle link of martyrs, I might find out others among tho&s;e names which are &s;till extant, that delivered down this account of our Saviour in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive tradition, till the whole <HI>Roman</HI> em|pire became Chri&s;tian; as there is no que&s;tion but numberle&s;s &s;eries of witne&s;&s;es might follow

one another in the &s;ame order, and in as &s;hort a chain, and that perhaps in every &s;ingle Church, had the names and ages of the mo&s;t eminent pri|mitive Chri&s;tians have been tran&s;mitted to us with the like certainty.</P>
<P N="11">XI. But to give this con&s;ideration more force, we mu&s;t take notice, that the tradition of the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity had &s;everal circum&s;tances peculiar to it, which made it more authentick than any other tradition in any other age of the world. The Chri&s;tians, who carried their reli|gion through &s;o many general and particular per|&s;ecutions, were ince&s;&s;antly comforting and &s;up|porting one another, with the example and hi&s;tory of our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles. It was the &s;ub|ject not only of their &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies, but of their private vi&s;its and conver&s;ations. <HI>Our virgins,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Tatian,</HI> who lived in the &s;econd century, <HI>di&s;|cour&s;e over their di&s;taffs on divine &s;ubjects.</HI> In|deed, when religion was woven into the civil go|vernment, and flouri&s;hed under the protection of the Emperors, men's thoughts and di&s;cour&s;es were, as they are now, full of &s;ecular affairs; but in the three fir&s;t centuries of Chri&s;tianity, men, who embraced this religion, had given up all their intere&s;ts in this world, and lived in a perpe|tual preparation for the next, as not knowing how &s;oon they might be called to it: &s;o that they had little el&s;e to talk of but the life and doct|rines of that divine per&s;on, which was their hope, their encouragement, and their glory. We can|not therefore imagine, that there was a &s;ingle per&s;on arrived at any degree of age or con&s;idera|tion, who had not heard and repeated above a thou&s;and times in his life, all the particulars of
<PB N="305" REF="265">
our Saviour's birth, life, death, re&s;urrection, and a&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P N="12">XII. E&s;pecially if we con&s;ider, that they could not then be received as Chri&s;tians, till they had undergone &s;everal examinations. Per&s;ons of ri|per years, who flocked daily into the Church during the three fir&s;t centuries, were obliged to pa&s;s through many repeated in&s;tructions, and give a &s;trict account of their proficiency, before they were admitted to Bapti&s;m. And as for tho&s;e who were born of Chri&s;tian parents, and had been bapti&s;ed in their infancy, they were with the like care prepared and di&s;ciplined for confirma|tion, which they could not arrive at, till they were found upon examination to have made a &s;ufficient progre&s;s in the knowledge of Chri&s;ti|anity.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. We mu&s;t further ob&s;erve, that there was not only in tho&s;e times this religious conver&s;a|tion among private Chri&s;tians, but a con&s;tant cor|re&s;pondence between the Churches that were e|&s;tabli&s;hed by the Apo&s;tles or their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in the &s;everal parts of the world. If any new doct|rine was &s;tarted, or any fact reported of our Savi|our, a &s;trict enquiry was made among the Chur|ches, e&s;pecially tho&s;e planted by the Apo&s;tles them|&s;elves, whether they had received any &s;uch doct|rine or account of our Saviour, from the mouths of the Apo&s;tles, or the tradition of tho&s;e Chri|&s;tians, who had preceded the pre&s;ent members of the Churches which were thus con&s;ulted. By this means, when any novelty was publi&s;hed, it was immediately detected and cen&s;ured.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. St. <HI>John,</HI> who lived &s;o many years after our Saviour, was appealed to in the&s;e emergen|cies
<PB N="306" REF="266">
as the living Oracle of the Church; and as his oral te&s;timony la&s;ted the fir&s;t century, many have ob&s;erved that, by a particular providence of God, &s;everal of our Saviour's Di&s;ciples, and of the early converts of his religion, lived to a very great age, that they might per&s;onally convey the truth of the Go&s;pel to tho&s;e times, which were very remote from the fir&s;t publication of it. Of the&s;e, be&s;ides St. <HI>John,</HI> we have a remark|able in&s;tance in <HI>Simeon,</HI> who was one of the &s;eventy &s;ent forth by our Saviour, to publi&s;h the Go&s;pel before his crucifixion, and a near kin&s;|man of the Lord.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THUS far we &s;ee how the learned <HI>Pa|gans</HI> might apprize them&s;elves from oral information of the particulars of our Saviour's hi&s;tory. They could hear, in every Church planted in every di&s;tant part of the earth, the account which was there received and pre&s;er|ved among them, of the hi&s;tory of our Saviour. They could learn the names and characters of tho&s;e fir&s;t mi&s;&s;ionaries that brought to them the&s;e
<PB N="308" REF="268">
accounts, and the miracles by which God Al|mighty atte&s;ted their reports. But the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to pre&s;erve the hi&s;tory of his life, and to &s;ecure their accounts of him from error and oblivion, did not only &s;et a&s;ide certain per&s;ons for that purpo&s;e, as has been already &s;hewn, but appropriated certain days to the commemora|tion of tho&s;e facts which they had related con|cerning him. The fir&s;t day of the week was in all its returns a perpetual memorial of his re&s;ur|rection, as the devotional exerci&s;es adapted to <HI>Fri|day</HI> and <HI>Saturday,</HI> were to denote to all ages that he was crucified on the one of tho&s;e days, and that he re&s;ted in the grave on the other. You may apply the &s;ame remark to &s;everal of the annual fe&s;tivals in&s;tituted by the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, or at furthe&s;t by their immediate Succe&s;&s;ors, in me|mory of the mo&s;t important particulars in our Sa|viour's hi&s;tory; to which we mu&s;t add the Sacra|ments in&s;tituted by our Lord him&s;elf, and many of tho&s;e rites and ceremonies which obtained in the mo&s;t early times of the Church. The&s;e are to be regarded as &s;tanding marks of &s;uch facts as were delivered by tho&s;e, who were eye-witne&s;&s;es to them, and which were contrived with great wi&s;dom to la&s;t till time &s;hould be no more. The&s;e, without any other means, might have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, conveyed to po&s;terity, the memo|ry of &s;everal tran&s;actions in the hi&s;tory of our Sa|viour, as they were related by his Di&s;ciples. At lea&s;t, the rea&s;on of the&s;e in&s;titutions, though they might be forgotten, and ob&s;cured by a long cour&s;e of years, could not but be very well known by tho&s;e who lived in the three fir&s;t Cen|turies, and a means of informing the inqui&s;itive
<PB N="309" REF="269">
<HI>Pagans</HI> in the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, that being the view in which I am to con&s;ider them.</P>
<P N="2">II. But lea&s;t &s;uch a tradition, though guarded by &s;o many expedients, &s;hould wear out by the length of time, the four Evangeli&s;ts within about fifty, or, as <HI>Theodoret</HI> affirms, thirty years, after our Saviour's death, while the memory of his actions was fre&s;h among them, con&s;igned to writing that hi&s;tory, which for &s;ome years had been publi&s;hed only by the mouth of the Apo|&s;tles and Di&s;ciples. The further con&s;ideration of the&s;e holy penmen will fall under another part of this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">III. It will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve here, that in the age which &s;ucceeded the Apo&s;tles, many of their immediate Di&s;ciples &s;ent or carrried in per|&s;on the books of the four Evangeli&s;ts, which had been written by Apo&s;tles, or at lea&s;t approved by them, to mo&s;t of the Churches which they had planted in the different parts of the world. This was done with &s;o much diligence, that when <HI>Pantaenus,</HI> a man of great learning and piety, had travelled into <HI>India</HI> for the propagation of Chri|&s;tianity, about the year of our Lord 200, he found among that remote people the Go&s;pel of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> which upon his return from that country he brought with him to <HI>Alexandria.</HI> This Go&s;pel is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been left in tho&s;e parts by St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> the Apo|&s;tle of the <HI>Indies,</HI> who probably carried it with him before the writings of the three other Evan|geli&s;ts were publi&s;h'd.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That the hi&s;tory of our Saviour, as recor|ded by the Evangeli&s;ts, was the &s;ame with that which had been before delivered by the Apo&s;tles
<PB N="286" REF="270">
and Di&s;ciples, will further appear in the pro&s;ecu|tion of this di&s;cour&s;e, and may be gathered from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="5">V. Had the&s;e writings differed from the &s;er|mons of the fir&s;t planters of Chri&s;tianity, either in hi&s;tory or doctrine, there is no que&s;tion but they would have been rejected by tho&s;e Churches which they had already formed. But &s;o con|&s;i&s;tent and uniform was the relation of the Apo|&s;tles, that the&s;e hi&s;tories appeared to be nothing el&s;e but their tradition and oral atte&s;tations made fixt and permanent. Thus was the fame of our Saviour, which in &s;o few years had gone through the whole earth, confirmed and perpetuated by &s;uch records, as would pre&s;erve the traditionary account of him to after-ages; and rectifie it, if at at any time, by pa&s;&s;ing through &s;everal genera|tions, it might drop any part that was material, or contract any thing that was fal&s;e or fictitious.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Accordingly we find the &s;ame <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who was born of a Virgin, who had wrought many miracles in <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> who was crucified, ro&s;e again, and a&s;cended into Heaven; I &s;ay, the &s;ame <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> had been preached, and was wor&s;hipped, in <HI>Germany, France, Spain,</HI> and <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in <HI>Parthia, Media, Me&s;opotamia, Armenia, Phrygia, A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Pamphylia,</HI> in <HI>Ita|ly, Egypt, Afric,</HI> and beyond <HI>Cyrene, India</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and, in &s;hort, in all the i&s;lands and pro|vinces that are vi&s;ited by the ri&s;ing or &s;etting &s;un. The &s;ame account of our Saviour's life and do|ctrine was delivered by thou&s;ands of Preachers, and believed in thou&s;ands of places, who all, as fa&s;t as it could be conveyed to them, received the
<PB N="287" REF="271">
&s;ame account in writing from the four Evange|li&s;ts.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> to this purpo&s;e very aptly re|marks, that tho&s;e barbarous nations, who in his time were not po&s;&s;e&s;t of the written go&s;pels, and had only learned the hi&s;tory of our Saviour from tho&s;e who had converted them to Chri&s;tianity be|fore the Go&s;pels were written, had among them the &s;ame accounts of our Saviour, which are to be met with in the four Evangeli&s;ts. An uncon|te&s;tible proof of the harmony and concurrence between the holy &s;cripture and the tradition of the Churches in tho&s;e early times of Chri&s;tia|nity.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Thus we &s;ee what opportunities the learned and inqui&s;itive heathens had of informing them&s;elves of the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, during the three fir&s;t Centuries, e&s;pecially as they lay nearer one than another to the fountain-head: be&s;ide which, there were many uncontroverted traditions, records of Chri&s;tianity, and particular hi&s;tories, that then threw light into the&s;e matters, but are now entirely lo&s;t, by which, at that time, any appearance of contradiction, or &s;eeming dif|ficulties, in the hi&s;tory of the Evangeli&s;ts, were fully cleared up and explained: though we meet with fewer appearances of this nature in the hi&s;to|ry of our Saviour, as related by the four Evange|li&s;ts, than in the accounts of any other per&s;on, publi&s;hed by &s;uch a number of different hi&s;tori|ans who lived at &s;o great a di&s;tance from the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Among tho&s;e records which are lo&s;t, and were of great u&s;e to the primitive Chri&s;tians, is the letter to <HI>Tiberius,</HI> which I have already men|tioned;
<PB N="312" REF="272">
that of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> which I &s;hall take notice of hereafter; the writings of <HI>Hege&s;ip|pus,</HI> who had drawn down the hi&s;tory of Chri&s;ti|anity to his own time, which was not beyond the middle of the &s;econd Century; the genuine <HI>Sibyl|line</HI> oracles, which in the fir&s;t ages of the Church were ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;purious; the records pre&s;erved in particular Churches, with many other of the &s;ame nature.</P>

<P N="1">I. THERE were other means, which I find had a great influence on the learned of the three fir&s;t Centuries, to create and confirm in them the belief of our ble&s;&s;ed Savi|our's hi&s;tory, which ought not to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. The fir&s;t was, the opportunity they en|joyed
<PB N="313" REF="273">
of examining tho&s;e miracles, which were on &s;everal occa&s;ions performed by Chri&s;tians, and appeared in the Church, more or le&s;s, during the&s;e fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity. The&s;e had great weight with the men I am now &s;peaking of, who, from learned <HI>Pagans,</HI> became fathers of the Church; for they frequently boa&s;t of them in their writings, as atte&s;tations given by God him|&s;elf to the truth of their religion.</P>
<P N="2">II. At the &s;ame time, that the&s;e learned men de|clare how di&s;igenuous, ba&s;e and wicked it would be, how much beneath the dignity of Philo&s;ophy, and contrary to the precepts of Chri&s;tianity, to utter fal&s;hoods or forgeries in the &s;upport of a cau&s;e, though never &s;o ju&s;t in it &s;elf, they con|fidently a&s;&s;ert this miraculous power, which then &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the Church, nay, tell us that they them&s;elves had been eye-witne&s;&s;es of it at &s;everal times, and in &s;everal in&s;tances; nay, appeal to the heathens them&s;elves for the truth of &s;everal facts they relate, nay challenge them to be pre|&s;ent at their a&s;&s;emblies, and &s;atisfy them&s;elves, if they doubt of it; nay we find that <HI>Pagan</HI> Au|thors have in &s;ome in&s;tances confe&s;&s;ed this mira|culous power.</P>
<P N="3">III. The letter of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> who&s;e ar|my was pre&s;erved by a refre&s;hing &s;hower, at the &s;ame time that his enemies were di&s;comfited by a &s;torm of lightning, and which the heathen hi&s;tori|ans them&s;elves allow to have been &s;upernatural and the effect of magic: I &s;ay, this letter, which a&s;cribed this unexpected a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the prayers of the Chri&s;tians, who then &s;erved in the army, would have been thought an unque&s;tionable te&s;timony of the miraculous power I am &s;peaking of,
<PB N="314" REF="274">
had it been &s;till pre&s;erved. It is &s;ufficient for me in this Place to take notice, that this was one of tho&s;e miracles which had its influence on the lear|ned Converts, becau&s;e it is related by <HI>Tertullian,</HI> and the very letter appealed to. When the&s;e learned men &s;aw &s;ickne&s;s and frenzy cured, the dead rai&s;ed, the oracles put to &s;ilence, the <HI>Daemons</HI> and evil &s;pirits forced to confe&s;s them&s;elves no Gods, by per&s;ons who only made u&s;e of prayer and adjurations in the name of their crucified Sa|viour; how could they doubt of their Saviour's power on the like occa&s;ions, as repre&s;ented to them by the traditions of the Church, and the writings of the Evangeli&s;ts?</P>
<P N="4">IV. Under this head, I cannot omit that which appears to me a &s;tanding miracle in the three fir&s;t Centuries, I mean that amazing and &s;upernatural courage or patience, which was &s;hewn by innu|merable multitudes of Martyrs, in tho&s;e &s;low and painful torments that were inflicted on them. I cannot conceive a man placed in the burning iron chair at <HI>Lyons,</HI> amid the in&s;ults and mockeries of a crouded Amphitheatre, and &s;till keeping his &s;eat; or &s;tretched upon a grate of iron, over coals of fire, and breathing out his &s;oul among the ex|qui&s;ite &s;ufferings of &s;uch a tedious execution, ra|ther than renounce his religion, or bla&s;pheme his Saviour. Such tryals &s;eem to me above the &s;trength of human nature, and able to over-bear duty, rea&s;on, faith, conviction, nay, and the mo&s;t ab&s;olute certainty of a future &s;tate. Humanity, una&s;&s;i&s;ted in an extraordinary manner, mu&s;t have &s;haken off the pre&s;ent pre&s;&s;ure, and have deliver'd it &s;elf out of &s;uch a dreadful di&s;tre&s;s, by any means that could have been &s;ugge&s;ted to it. We can
<PB N="315" REF="275">
ea&s;ily imagine, that many per&s;ons, in &s;o good a cau&s;e, might have laid down their lives at the gib|bet, the &s;take, or the block: but to expire lei&s;ure|ly among the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tortures, when they might come out of them, even by a mental re&s;er|vation, or an hypocri&s;y which was not without a po&s;&s;ibility of being followed by repentance and for|givene&s;s, has &s;omething in it, &s;o far beyond the force and natural &s;trength of mortals, that one cannot but think there was &s;ome miraculous pow|er to &s;upport the &s;ufferer.</P>
<P N="5">V. We find the Church of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> in that ad|mirable letter which gives an account of the death of <HI>Polycarp</HI> their beloved Bi&s;hop, mentioning the cruel torments of other early Martyrs for Chri&s;ti|anity, are of opinion, that our Saviour &s;tood by them in a vi&s;ion, and per&s;onally conver&s;ed with them, to give them &s;trength and comfort during the bitterne&s;s of their long-continued agonies; and we have the &s;tory of a young man, who, having &s;uffered many tortures, e&s;caped with life, and told his fellow-chri&s;tians, that the pain of them had been rendered tolerable, by the pre&s;ence of an Angel who &s;tood by him, and wiped off the tears and &s;weat, which ran down his face whil&s;t he lay under his &s;ufferings. We are a&s;&s;ured at lea&s;t that the fir&s;t Martyr for Chri&s;tianity was encouraged in his la&s;t moments, by a vi&s;ion of that divine per|&s;on, for whom he &s;uffered, and into who&s;e pre|&s;ence he was then ha&s;tening.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Let any man calmly lay his hand upon his heart, and after reading the&s;e terrible conflicts in which the ancient Martyrs and Confe&s;&s;ors were engaged, when they pa&s;&s;ed through &s;uch new in|ventions and varieties of pain, as tired their tor|mentors;
<PB N="316" REF="276">
and ask him&s;elf, however zealous and &s;incere he is in his religion, whether under &s;uch acute and lingring tortures he could &s;till have held fa&s;t his integrity, and have profe&s;&s;ed his faith to the la&s;t, without a &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome kind or other. For my part, when I con&s;ider that it was not an unaccountable ob&s;tinacy in a &s;ingle man, or in any particular &s;ett of men, in &s;ome extraordinary juncture; but that there were multitudes of each &s;ex, of every age, of different countries and conditions, who for near 300 years together made this glorious confe&s;&s;ion of their faith, in the mid&s;t of tortures, and in the hour of death: I mu&s;t conclude, that they were ei|ther of another make than men are at pre&s;ent, or that they had &s;uch miraculous &s;upports as were peculiar to tho&s;e times of Chri&s;tianity, when without them perhaps the very name of it might have been extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P N="7">VII. It is certain, that the deaths and &s;ufferings of the primitive Chri&s;tians had a great &s;hare in the conver&s;ion of tho&s;e learned <HI>Pagans,</HI> who lived in the ages of Per&s;ecution, which with &s;ome inter|vals and abatements la&s;ted near 300 years after our Saviour. <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr, Tertullian, Lactan|tius, Arnobius,</HI> and others, tell us, that this fir&s;t of all alarmed their curio&s;ity, rou&s;ed their attenti|on, and made them &s;eriou&s;ly inqui&s;itive into the nature of that religion, which could endue the mind with &s;o much &s;trength, and overcome the fear of death, nay rai&s;e an earne&s;t de&s;ire of it, though it appeared in all its terrors. This they found had not been effected by all the doctrines of tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers, whom they had thoroughly &s;tudied, and who had been labouring at this great
<PB N="317" REF="277">
point. The &s;ight of the&s;e dying and tormented Martyrs engaged them to &s;earch into the hi&s;tory and doctrines of him for whom they &s;uffered. The more they &s;earched, the more they were con|vinced; till their conviction grew &s;o &s;trong, that they them&s;elves embraced the &s;ame truths, and ei|ther actually laid down their lives, or were always in a readine&s;s to do it, rather than depart from them.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THE &s;econd of tho&s;e extraordinary means, of great u&s;e to the learned and inqui&s;itive <HI>Pagans</HI> of the three fir&s;t Centuries, for evincing the truth of the hi&s;tory of our Saviour, was the completion of &s;uch prophecies as are
<PB N="318" REF="278">
recorded of him in the Evangeli&s;ts. They could not indeed form any arguments from what he foretold, and was fulfilled during his life, be|cau&s;e both the prophecy and the completion were over before they were publi&s;hed by the Evange|li&s;ts; though, as <HI>Origen</HI> ob&s;erves, what end could there be in forging &s;ome of the&s;e predictions, as that of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s denying his ma&s;ter, and all his Di&s;ciples for&s;aking him in the greate&s;t extremity, which reflects &s;o much &s;hame on the great A|po&s;tle, and on all his companions? Nothing but a &s;trict adherence to truth, and to matters of fact, could have prompted the Evangeli&s;ts to re|late a circum&s;tance &s;o di&s;advantageous to their own reputation; as that Father has well ob&s;er|ved.</P>
<P N="2">II. But to pur&s;ue his reflections on this Sub|ject. There are predictions of our Saviour re|corded by the Evangeli&s;ts, which were not com|pleted till after their deaths, and had no likeli|hood of being &s;o, when they were pronounced by our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. Such was that wonderful notice he gave them, that they &s;hould be brought before Governours and Kings for his &s;ake, for a te&s;timony again&s;t them and the <HI>Gentiles, Mat.</HI> 10.28. with the other like prophecies, by which he foretold that his Di&s;ciples were to be per&s;ecuted. Is there any other doctrine in the world, &s;ays this Father, who&s;e followers are puni&s;hed? Can the enemies of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;ay, that he knew his opinions were fal&s;e and impious, and that therefore he might well conjecture and foretell what would be the treatment of tho&s;e per&s;ons who &s;hould embrace them? Suppo&s;ing his doctrines were really &s;uch, why &s;hould this be the con&s;equence? what likeli|hood
<PB N="319" REF="279">
that men &s;hould be brought before Kings and Governours for opinions and tenets of any kind, when this never happened even to the <HI>Epicureans,</HI> who ab&s;olutely denied a Providence; nor to the <HI>Peripateticks</HI> them&s;elves, who laughed at the prayers and &s;acrifices which were made to the Divinity? Are there any but the Chri&s;tians who, according to this prediction of our Saviour, being brought before Kings and Governours for his &s;ake, are pre&s;&s;ed to their late&s;t ga&s;p of breath, by their re&s;pective judges, to renounce Chri&s;tiani|ty, and to procure their liberty and re&s;t, by of|fering the &s;ame &s;acrifices, and taking the &s;ame oaths that others did?</P>
<P N="3">III. Con&s;ider the time when our Saviour pro|nounced tho&s;e words, Matt. 10.32. <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall confe&s;s me before men, him will I confe&s;s al&s;o before my Father which is in heaven: but who&s;o|ever &s;hall deny me before men, him will I al&s;o de|ny before my Father which is in heaven.</HI> Had you heard him &s;peak after this manner, when as yet his Di&s;ciples were under no &s;uch tryals, you would certainly have &s;aid within your &s;elf, If the&s;e &s;peeches of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> are true, and if, accord|ing to his prediction, Governours and Kings under|take to ruin and de&s;troy tho&s;e who &s;hall profe&s;s them&s;elves his Di&s;ciples, we will believe (not only that he is a Prophet) but that he has re|ceived power from God &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve and propagate his religion; and that he would never talk in &s;uch a peremptory and di&s;courag|ing manner, were he not a&s;&s;ured that he was able to &s;ubdue the mo&s;t powerful oppo&s;ition, that could be made again&s;t the faith and doctrine which he taught.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="320" REF="280">IV. Who is not &s;truck with admiration, when he repre&s;ents to him&s;elf our Saviour at that time foretelling, that his Go&s;pel &s;hould be preached in all the world, for a witne&s;s unto all nations, or as St. <HI>Origen</HI> (who rather quotes the &s;en&s;e than the words) to &s;erve for a conviction to Kings and people, when at the &s;ame time he finds that his Go&s;pel has accordingly been preached to <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Barbarians,</HI> to the learned and to the ignorant, and that there is no quality or con|dition of life able to exempt men from &s;ubmitting to the doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> As for us, &s;ays this great Author, in another part of his book again&s;t <HI>Cel&s;us?</HI>
<Q REND="margQuotes">When we &s;ee every day tho&s;e events exactly accompli&s;hed which our Saviour foretold at &s;o great a di&s;tance: That his Go&s;pel is preached in all the world, <HI>Mat|thew</HI> 24.14. That his Di&s;ciples go and teach all nations, <HI>Matthew</HI> 28.19. And that tho&s;e, who have received his doctrine, are brought for his &s;ake before Governours, and before Kings, <HI>Matthew</HI> 10.18. we are filled with admiration, and our faith in him is confirmed more and more. What clearer and &s;tronger proofs can <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> ask for the truth of what he &s;poke?</Q></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Origen</HI> in&s;i&s;ts likewi&s;e with great &s;trength on that wonderful prediction of our Saviour, concerning the de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> pronoun|ced at a time, as he ob&s;erves, when there was no likelihood nor appearance of it. This has been taken notice of and inculcated by &s;o many others, that I &s;hall refer you to what this Father has &s;aid on the &s;ubject in the fir&s;t book again&s;t <HI>Cel&s;us.</HI> And as to the accompli&s;hment of this remarka|ble
<PB N="321" REF="281">
prophecy, &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that whoever reads the account given us by <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> without knowing his character, and compares it with what our Saviour foretold, would think the hi|&s;torian had been a Chri&s;tian, and that he had no|thing el&s;e in view but to adju&s;t the event to the prediction.</P>
<P N="6">VI. I cannot quit this head without taking notice, that <HI>Origen</HI> would &s;till have tri|umphed more in the foregoing arguments, had he lived an age longer, to have &s;een the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, and all their Governors and provin|ces, &s;ubmitting them&s;elves to the Chri&s;tian religi|on, and glorying in its profe&s;&s;ion, as &s;o many Kings and Soveraigns &s;till place their relation to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> at the head of their titles.</P>
<P>How much greater confirmation of his faith would he have received, had he &s;een our Saviour's prophecy &s;tand good in the de&s;truction of the temple, and the di&s;&s;olution of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Oeco|nomy, when <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Pagans</HI> united all their endeavours under <HI>Julian</HI> the Apo&s;tate, to baffle and fal&s;ifie the prediction? The great preparations that were made for rebuilding the temple, with the hurricane, earthquake, and eruptions of fire, that de&s;troyed the work, and terrified tho&s;e em|ployed in the attempt from proceeding in it, are related by many hi&s;torians of the &s;ame age, and the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;tory te&s;tified both by <HI>Pa|gan</HI> and <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> writers, as <HI>Ammianus Marcel|linus</HI> and <HI>Zemath-David.</HI> The learned <HI>Chry|&s;o&s;tome,</HI> in a &s;ermon again&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> tells them this fact was then fre&s;h in the memories even of their young men, that it happened but twen|ty years ago, and that it was atte&s;ted by all the
<PB N="322" REF="282">
inhabitants of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> where they might &s;till &s;ee the marks of it in the rubbi&s;h of that work, from which the <HI>Jews</HI> de&s;i&s;ted in &s;o great a fright, and which even <HI>Julian</HI> had not the cou|rage to carry on. This fact, which is in it &s;elf &s;o miraculous, and &s;o indi&s;putable, brought o|ver many of the <HI>Jews</HI> to Chri&s;tianity; and &s;hows us, that after our Saviour's prophecy again&s;t it, the temple could not be pre&s;erved from the plough pa&s;&s;ing over it, by all the care of <HI>Titus,</HI> who would fain have prevented its de&s;truction, and that in&s;tead of being re-edified by <HI>Julian,</HI> all his endeavours towards it did but &s;till more literally accompli&s;h our Saviour's prediction, that not one &s;tone &s;hould be left upon ano|ther.</P>
<P>The antient Chri&s;tians were &s;o entirely per|&s;uaded of the force of our Saviour's prophecies and of the puni&s;hment which the <HI>Jews</HI> had drawn upon them&s;elves, and upon their children, for the treatment which the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> had received at their hands, that they did not doubt but they would always remain an abandoned and di&s;per&s;ed people, an hi&s;&s;ing and an a&s;toni&s;hment among the nati|ons, as they are to this day. In &s;hort, that they had lo&s;t their peculiarity of being God's peo|ple, which was now transferred to the body of Chri&s;tians, and which pre&s;erved the Church of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> among all the conflicts, difficul|ties and per&s;ecutions, in which it was enga|ged, as it had pre&s;erved the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> government and oeconomy for &s;o many ages, whil&s;t it had the &s;ame truth and vital principle in it, notwith&s;tand|ing it was &s;o frequently in danger of being utterly aboli&s;hed and de&s;troyed. <HI>Origen,</HI> in his fourth
<PB N="323" REF="283">
book again&s;t <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> mentioning their being ca&s;t out of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the place to which their wor|&s;hip was annexed, deprived of their temple and &s;acrifice, their religious rites and &s;olemnities, and &s;cattered over the face of the earth, ventures to a&s;&s;ure them with a face of confidence, that they would never be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;ince they had committed that horrid crime again&s;t the Sa|viour of the world. This was a bold a&s;&s;ertion in the good man, who knew how this people had been &s;o wonderfully re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in former times, when they were almo&s;t &s;wallowed up, and in the mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;tate of de&s;olation, as in their deliverance out of the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> captivity, and the oppre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes.</HI> Nay, he knew that within le&s;s than a hundred years be|fore his own time, the <HI>Jews</HI> had made &s;uch a powerful effort for their re-e&s;tabli&s;hment under <HI>Barchocab,</HI> in the reign of <HI>Adrian,</HI> as &s;hook the whole <HI>Roman</HI> empire. But he founded his opi|nion on a &s;ure word of prophecy, and on the puni&s;hment they had &s;o ju&s;tly incurred; and we find, by a long experience of 1500 years, that he was not mi&s;taken, nay that his opinion gathers &s;trength daily, &s;ince the <HI>Jews</HI> are now at a grea|ter di&s;tance from any probability of &s;uch a re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, than they were when <HI>Origen</HI> wrote.</P>

<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> Pur&s;ued.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THERE was one other means enjoyed by the learned <HI>Pagans</HI> of the three fir&s;t centuries, for &s;atisfying them in the truth of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, which I might have flung under one of the foregoing heads; but as it is &s;o &s;hining a particular, and does &s;o much honour to our religion, I &s;hall make a di&s;tinct article of it, and only con&s;ider it with regard to the &s;ubject I am upon: I mean the lives and manners of tho&s;e holy men, who believed in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> during the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity. I &s;hould be thought to advance a paradox, &s;hould I affirm that there were More Chri&s;tians in the world during tho&s;e times of per&s;ecution, than there are at pre&s;ent in the&s;e which we call the
<PB N="325" REF="285">
flouri&s;hing times of Chri&s;tianity. But this will be found an indi&s;putable truth, if we form our calculation upon the opinions which prevailed in tho&s;e days, that every one who lives in the ha|bitual practice of any voluntary &s;in, actually cuts him&s;elf off from the benefits and profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, and whatever he may call him&s;elf, is in reality no Chri&s;tian, nor ought to be e&s;teem|ed as &s;uch.</P>
<P N="2">II. In the times we are now &s;urveying, the Chri&s;tian religion &s;howed its full force and effi|cacy on the minds of men, and by many examples demon&s;trated what great and generous &s;ouls it was capable of producing. It exalted and refined its pro&s;elytes to a very high degree of perfection, and &s;et them far above the plea&s;ures, and even the pains, of this life. It &s;trengthened the infir|mity, and broke the fiercene&s;s of human nature. It lifted up the minds of the ignorant to the know|ledge and wor&s;hip of him that made them, and in|&s;pired the vicious with a rational devotion, a &s;trict purity of heart, and an unbounded love to their fellow-creatures. In proportion as it &s;pread through the world, it &s;eemed to change mankind into another &s;pecies of Beings. No &s;ooner was a convert initiated into it, but by an ea&s;y figure he became a New Man, and both acted and look|ed upon him&s;elf as one regenerated and born a &s;econd time into another &s;tate of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P N="3">III. It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to be more particular in the accounts of primitive Chri&s;tianity, which have been exhibited &s;o well by others, but ra|ther to ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Pagan</HI> converts, of whom I am now &s;peaking, mention this great refor|mation of tho&s;e who had been the greate&s;t &s;in|ners,
<PB N="326" REF="286">
with that &s;udden and &s;urpri&s;ing change which it made in the lives of the mo&s;t profli|gate, as having &s;omething in it &s;upernatural, mi|raculous, and more than human. <HI>Origen</HI> repre|&s;ents this power in the Chri&s;tian religion, as no le&s;s wonderful than that of curing the lame and blind, or clean&s;ing the leper. Many others re|pre&s;ent it in the &s;ame light, and looked upon it as an argument that there was a certain divinity in that religion, which &s;howed it &s;elf in &s;uch &s;trange and glorious effects.</P>
<P N="4">IV. This therefore was a great means not on|ly of recommending Chri&s;tianity to hone&s;t and learned heathens, but of confirming them in the belief of our Saviour's hi&s;tory, when they &s;aw multitudes of virtuous men daily forming them|&s;elves upon his example, animated by his precepts, and actuated by that Spirit which he had promi&s;ed to &s;end among his Di&s;ciples.</P>
<P N="5">V. But I find no argument made a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the&s;e eminent <HI>Pagan</HI> converts, for &s;trengthening their faith in the hi&s;tory of our Saviour, than the predictions rela|ting to him in tho&s;e old prophetick writings, which were depo&s;ited among the hands of the greate&s;t enemies to Chri&s;tianity, and owned by them to have been extant many ages before his appearance. The learned heathen converts were a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee the whole hi&s;tory of their Sa|viour's life publi&s;hed before he was born, and to find that the Evangeli&s;ts and Prophets, in their ac|counts of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> differed only in point of time, the one foretelling what &s;hould happen to him, and the other de&s;cribing tho&s;e very particu|lars as what had actually happened. This our
<PB N="327" REF="287">
Saviour him&s;elf was plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of as the &s;tronge&s;t argument of his being the pro|mi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and without it would hardly have reconciled his Di&s;ciples to the ignominy of his death, as in that remarkable pa&s;&s;age which men|tions his conver&s;ation with the two Di&s;ciples, on the day of his re&s;urrection. St. <HI>Luke,</HI> chap. 24. ver&s;e 13. to the end.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The heathen converts, after having travel|led through all human learning, and fortified their minds with the knowledge of arts and &s;cien|ces, were particularly qualified to examine the&s;e prophecies with great care and impartiality, and without prejudice or prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. If the <HI>Jews</HI> on the one &s;ide put an unnatural interpretation on the&s;e prophecies, to evade the force of them in their controver&s;ies with the Chri&s;tians; or if the Chri&s;tians on the other &s;ide over-&s;trained &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in their applications of them, as it often happens among men of the be&s;t under&s;tanding, when their minds are heated with any con&s;i|deration that bears a more than an ordinary weight with it: the learned Heathens may be looked upon as neuters in the matter, when all the&s;e prophecies were new to them, and their educa|tion had left the interpretation of them free and indifferent. Be&s;ides, the&s;e learned men among the primitive Chri&s;tians, knew how the <HI>Jews,</HI> who had preceded our Saviour, interpreted the&s;e predictions, and the &s;everal marks by which they acknowledged the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> would be di&s;co|vered, and how tho&s;e of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Doctors who &s;ucceeded him, had deviated from the inter|pretations and doctrines of their forefathers, on purpo&s;e to &s;tifle their own conviction.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="328" REF="288">VII. This &s;ett of arguments had therefore an invincible force with tho&s;e <HI>Pagan</HI> Philo&s;ophers who became Chri&s;tians, as we find in mo&s;t of their writings. They could not disbelieve our Saviour's hi&s;tory, which &s;o exactly agreed with every thing that had been written of him many a|ges before his birth, nor doubt of tho&s;e circum|&s;tances being fulfilled in him, which could not be true of any per&s;on that lived in the world be|&s;ides him&s;elf. This wrought the greate&s;t confu|&s;ion in the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> and the greate&s;t conviction in the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who every where &s;peak with a&s;toni&s;hment of the&s;e truths they met with in this new magazine of learning which was opened to them, and carry the point &s;o far as to think whatever excellent doctrine they had met with among <HI>Pagan</HI> writers, had been &s;tole from their conver&s;ation with the <HI>Jews,</HI> or from the peru&s;al of the&s;e writings which they had in their cu&s;tody.</P>
