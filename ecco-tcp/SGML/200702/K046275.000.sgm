<HEAD>THE PUBLISHER's APPEAL TO THE CANDOUR AND JUSTICE OF THE NATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT would ill become me to make any re|marks on my examination before a com|mittee of the Hou&s;e of Commons, re&s;pecting the Author of <Q REND="inline">"Thoughts on the Engli&s;h Government."</Q> My conduct on that occa|&s;ion could give no ju&s;t offence to any party, and was &s;poken of in very favourable terms by Mr. Windham, Mr. Woodford his &s;e|cretary, and &s;everal of their friends. As a mark of their e&s;teem, they promi&s;ed me a pamphlet which Mr. Burke was then pre|paring for the pre&s;s, and which he &s;oon after put into my hands. On giving me the la&s;t &s;heet, with his final corrections, <Q REND="inline">"There," &s;aid he, "that is <HI>your own</HI></Q>&mdash;It is but a tri|vial thing&mdash;I do not know that it will <HI>pay you for paper and printing.</HI>&mdash;I mu&s;t al&s;o do Mr. Burke the ju&s;tice to acknowledge that
<PB N="2" REF="4">
he &s;eemed to rejoice at my &s;ucce&s;s; and to &s;hew his de&s;ire of farther promoting it, gave me his <Q REND="inline">"Thoughts on a Regicide Peace."</Q> I felt the full force of the favour, and chear|fully took upon me the trouble of dancing backwards and forwards alternately between Author and Printer, three or four times a day for almo&s;t three months, to attend to &s;uch a variety of alterations as can be con|ceived only by tho&s;e who are acquainted with the whims, the caprice and the eternal ver&s;atility of genius. After an interval of &s;ix months, the publication having been for that time &s;u&s;pended, and ju&s;t at the mo|ment that I expected to receive &s;ome little return for my fatiguing exertions, I was &s;uddenly called upon by the Rev. Dr. King, with a &s;ort of me&s;&s;age from Mr. Burke, de|&s;iring an account of the former work. I was really &s;hocked at a demand &s;o repug|nant to all my ideas of that gentleman's cha|racter. I know he has not &s;o &s;hort a me|mory as to forget the terms on which he made me a pre&s;ent of the manu&s;cript. I had made no provi&s;ion to &s;ettle for the profits of a voluntary gift, nor had I kept any account
<PB N="3" REF="5">
of them. I mu&s;t al&s;o a&s;&s;ert, that in order to &s;hew my&s;elf not inferior even to Mr. Burke in genero&s;ity, I liberally &s;upplied all his friends with copies of the work <HI>gratis,</HI> &s;o that I believe, if an exact account had been kept, it would not appear that I lay under any very weighty obligation. Rou&s;ed, how|ever, by &s;o &s;trange a demand, I called upon Mr. Windham's &s;ecretary to remon&s;trate on the illiberality, inju&s;tice, and unrea&s;on|ablene&s;s of &s;uch a claim for what I could not help con&s;idering as a pre&s;ent: he replied, <Q REND="inline">"It is very true:&mdash;it was meant &s;o:&mdash;but Mr. Burke has thought otherwi&s;e &s;ince."</Q>&mdash;I then called upon Mr. Nagle, the near re|lation and confidential friend of Mr. Burke, who had expre&s;&s;ed no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;e on hearing the matter fir&s;t mentioned by Dr. King, and who&s;e exact words were, <Q REND="inline">"By heavens! Owen conceived the Pamphlet to be his <HI>own;</HI> and &s;o did I."</Q>&mdash;If Mr. Burke's con|ceptions then &s;hould run counter in this in|&s;tance to the dictates of plain &s;en&s;e, and to the ideas of his own neare&s;t and deare&s;t friends, I hope my character can never be injured by his unaccountable eccenticities. The man, who

can write &s;o beautiful a panegyric on royal bounty, would never &s;urely incur the reproach of attempting to retract <HI>his own</HI> gifts, or even to &s;trip a poor book&s;eller of the accidental pro|fits of publi&s;hing an e&s;&s;ay on munificence. He has al&s;o, I am per&s;uaded, too much dig|nity of &s;entiment to be offended with my bringing forward the pre&s;ent work, on ac|count of its interfering in any &s;ort with his <HI>new</HI> arguments again&s;t a Peace with a <HI>Regi|cide Directory.</HI> I am in fact promoting his own wi&s;hes to cut off <HI>all intercour&s;e</HI> with <HI>Re|gicides;</HI> and I rely upon his kind and di&s;in|tere&s;ted recommendation of the&s;e <HI>old Thoughts</HI> on the &s;ubject, which are now pre&s;ented to the Public with the venerable marks, and &s;ilver honours of age.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. On the Overtures of Peace.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNTIL the beginning of this session, not|withstanding many untoward appearances, I still flattered myself that I should have no other than domestick afflictions to cloud the evening of my life: but a state of things is threatened, which, whatever room private griefs may occupy, leaves a vast vacuity to be filled with publick sorrow.</P>
<P>If I estimate rightly, what is going to be suf|fered, from what is going to be done, it is from something the very reverse of philosophy, that we are to learn content. In the interval between the treaty of peace with Regicide, and it's inevitable consequences, we must owe our repose not to deep thinking, but to the absence of all thought. To enjoy life, we must forget every thing of what England has been, and of what we have been our|selves. England has been happy; and change is
<PB N="2" REF="8">
a word of ill sound to happy ears. A great revolution is on the point of being accomplished. It is a revolution not in human affairs, but in man himself. The system of France aims at no|thing short of this. If we are tired of being the men we were, and disgusted with the society in which we have lived, France offers her <HI>regenera|tion.</HI> By whatever humiliations we buy a blessing, I admit that the nature of the object purchased remains the same. On that supposition, the ad|vances we have made to the Republick of Regi|cide, are made on a consistent plan. But if what she terms regeneration, is what we call death, then, instead of advancing, we should retreat, and fly from Jacobin remedies as from the most ter|rible of all diseases.</P>
<P>Observe at the outset, that I suppose a peace with Jacobinism, the submission to it's laws, and the adoption of it's whole scheme, to be so neces|sarily connected, that never, in sound logic, did the conclusion follow the premises with more cer|tainty, than as I conceive it, in the course of Na|ture, that effect will be the result of this cause.</P>
<P>In one thing we are lucky. The regicide has re|ceived our advances with scorn. We have an enemy, to whose virtues we can owe nothing; but on this occasion we are infinitely obliged to
<PB N="3" REF="9">
one of his vices. We owe more to his insolence than to our own precaution. The haughtiness by which the proud repel us, has this of good in it, that in making us keep our distance, they must keep their distance too. In the present case, the pride of the Regicide may be our safety. He has given time for our reason to operate; and for Bri|tish dignity to recover from its surprise.</P>
<P>There is always an augury to be taken of what a peace is likely to be, from the preliminary steps that are made to bring it about. We may gather something from the time in which the first over|tures are made; from the quarter whence they come; from the manner in which they are received. These discover the temper of the parties. If your enemy offers peace in the moment of success, it indicates that he is satisfied with something. It shews that there are limits to his ambition or his resentment. If he offers nothing under misfor|tune, it is probable, that it is more painful to him to abandon advantage than to endure calamity. If he rejects solicitation, and will not give even a nod to the suppliants for peace, until a change in the fortune of the war threatens him with ruin, then I think it evident, that he wishes nothing more than to disarm his adversary and to gain time. Afterwards a question arises, which of the
<PB N="4" REF="10">
parties is likely to obtain the greater advantages, by the use of time and by continuing disarmed?</P>
<P>With these few, plain indications in our minds, it will not be improper to re-consider the conduct of the enemy together with our own, from the day that a question of peace has been in agitation. In considering this part of the question, I do not proceed on my own hypothesis. I suppose, for a moment, that this body of Regicide, calling itself a Republick, is a politick person, with whom something deserving the name of peace may be made. On that supposition, let us examine our own proceeding. Let us compute the profit it has brought, and the advantage that it is likely to bring hereafter. A peace too eagerly sought, is not always the sooner obtained; and when obtained, it never can be every thing we wish. The discovery of vehement wishes generally frustrates their attainment; and your adversary has gained a great advantage over you when he finds you impatient to conclude a treaty. There is in reserve, not only something of dig|nity, but a great deal of prudence too. A sort of courage belongs to negotiation as well as to operations of the field. A negotiator must seem willing to hazard all, if he wishes to secure any material point.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="11">
The Regicide was the first to declare war. We are the first to sue for peace. We have twice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Once in the Speech from the Throne; once by a mes|sage. What other direct advances have been made I have not heard; nor do I know of any.</NOTE> solicited to be admitted to Jacobin embraces. Twice we have been repelled with cold disdain. It is true, that pride may reject a publick ad|vance, whilst interest listens to a secret suggestion of advantage. The opportunity has been afforded. A gentleman has been sent on an errand, of which, from the motive of it, whatever the event might be, we never can be ashamed. Humanity cannot be degraded by humiliation. It is it's very cha|racter to submit to such things. There is a con|sanguinity between benevolence and humility. They are virtues of the same stock. Dignity is of as good a race; but it belongs to the family of Fortitude. In the spirit of that benevolence, we sent a gentleman to beseech the Directory of Re|gicides, not to be quite so prodigal as they had been of judicial murder. We solicited them to spare the lives of some unhappy persons of the first distinction, whose safety at other times could not have been an object of solicitation. They had quitted France on the faith of the decla|ration of the rights of citizens. They never had been in the service of the Regicides, nor at their
<PB N="6" REF="12">
hands had received any stipend. The very system and constitution of government that now prevails, was settled subsequent to their emigration. They were under the protection of Great Britain, and in his Majesty's pay and service. Not an hostile invasion, but the disasters of the sea had thrown them upon a shore, more barbarous and inhospi|table than the inclement ocean under the most pitiless of its storms. Here was an opportunity to express a feeling for the miseries of war; and to open some sort of conversation, which, (after our public overtures had glutted their pride) at a cau|tious and jealous distance, might lead to something like an accommodation. What was the event? A strange uncouth thing, a theatrical figure of the opera, his head shaded with three coloured plumes, his body fantastically habited, strutted from the back scenes, and after a short speech, in the mock-heroic falsetto of stupid tragedy, delivered the gentleman who came to make the representation into the custody of a guard, with directions not to lose sight of him for a moment, and then ordered him to be sent from Paris in two hours.</P>
<P>Here it is impossible that a sentiment of tender|ness should not strike athwart the sternness of po|liticks, and make us recal to painful memory, the difference between this insolent and bloody thea|tre,
<PB N="7" REF="13">
and the temperate, natural majesty of a civi|lized court, where the afflicted family of Asgill did not in vain solicit the mercy of the highest in rank, and the most compassionate of the compas|sionate sex.</P>
<P>Whilst the fortune of the field was wholly with the Regicides, nothing was thought of but to fol|low where it led; and it led to every thing. Not so much as a talk of treaty. Laws were laid down with arrogance. The most moderate politician amongst them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boissy d'Anglas.</NOTE> was chosen as the organ, not so much for prescribing limits to their claims, as to mark what, for the present, they are content to leave to others. They made not laws, not Con|ventions, but late possession, but physical nature, and political convenience the sole foundation of their claims. The Rhine, the Mediterranean, and the ocean were the bounds which, for the time, they assigned to the empire of Regicide. In truth, with these limits, and their principle, they would not have left even the shadow of liberty or safety to any nation. This plan of empire was not taken up in the first intoxication of unexpected success. You must recollect, that it was projected just as the report has stated it, from the very first revolt of the faction against their Monarchy; and it has been uniformly pursued, as a standing maxim of national
<PB N="8" REF="14">
policy, from that time to this. It is in the season of prosperity that men discover their real tempers, principles, and designs. This report, combined with their conduct, forms an infallible criterion of the views of this Republick.</P>
<P>The tide of success began to turn. We are to see how their minds have been affected with this change. Some impression it made on them un|doubtedly. It produced some oblique notice of the submissions that were made by suppliant nations. The utmost they did, was to make some of those cold, formal, general professions of a love of peace which no power ever refused to make; because they mean little, and cost nothing. The first pa|per I have seen (the publication at Hamburgh) making a shew of that pacific disposition, disco|vered a rooted animosity, and incurable rancour, more than any of their military operations. They choose to suppose, that this war, on the part of England, is a war of Government, begun and carried on against the sense and interests of the people; thus sowing in their very overtures towards peace, the seeds of tumult and sedition; for they never have abandoned, and never will abandon, in peace, in war, in treaty, in any situation, or for one instant, their old steady maxim of separating the people from the Government.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="15">
We have since seen them take up the matter with great formality. On that occasion they dis|covered still more clearly the bottom of their cha|racter. The offers made to them by the message to Parliament was hinted at; but in an obscure and oblique manner as before. They accompanied their notice of the indications manifested on our side, with every kind of insolent and taunting reflexion. The Regicide Directory, on the day which, in their gipsy jargon, they call the 5th of Pluviose, in return for our ad|vances, charge us with eluding our declarations under <Q REND="inline">"evasive formalities and frivolous pretexts."</Q> They proceed to charge us, and, as it should seem, our allies in the mass, with direct <HI>perfidy</HI>&mdash;and go so far as to say, that this perfidious character was nothing new to us. However, notwithstanding this our habitual perfidy, they will offer peace <Q REND="inline">"on conditions <HI>as</HI> moderate"</Q>&mdash;as what? as reason and as equity require? No! as moderate <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as are suitable to their <HI>national dignity.</HI>"</Q> Dignity, hi|therto, has belonged to the mode of proceeding, not to the matter of a treaty. Never before has it been mentioned as the standard for rating the conditions of peace;&mdash;no, never by the most vio|lent of conquerors. Indemnity is capable of some estimate; dignity has no standard. It is impos|sible to guess what acquisitions pride and ambition may think fit for their <HI>dignity.</HI> But lest any doubt
<PB N="10" REF="16">
should remain on what they think for their dig|nity, the Regicides in the next paragraph tell us <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that they will have no peace with their enemies, until they have reduced them to a state which will put them under an <HI>impossibility</HI> of pursuing their unfortunate projects;"</Q> that is, in plain French or English, until they have accom|plished our utter and irretrievable ruin. This is their <HI>pacific</HI> language, and it is their unalterable principle in whatever language they speak, or whatever steps they take, whether of real war, or of pretended pacification. They have never, to do them justice, been at much trouble in concealing their intentions. We were as obstinately re|solved to think them not in earnest. I confess this sort of jests, whatever their urbanity may be, are not much to my taste.</P>
<P>To this obliging, conciliatory, and amicable communication, our sole answer, in effect, is this.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Citizen Regicides! whenever <HI>you</HI> find yourselves in the humour, you may have a peace with <HI>us.</HI> That is a point you may always command as se|cure. We are constantly in attendance, and no|thing you can do shall hinder us from the re|newal of our supplications."</Q></P>
<P>To those, who do not love to contemplate the fall of human greatness, I do not know a more
<PB N="11" REF="17">
mortifying spectacle, than to see the assembled majesty of the crowned heads of Europe waiting as patient suitors in the anti-chamber of Regicides. They wait, it seems, until the sanguinary tyrant, <HI>Rewbell,</HI> shall have snorted away the fumes of the indigested blood of his Sovereign;&mdash;then, when sunk on the down of usurped pomp, he shall have sufficiently indulged his meditations with what King he shall next glut his ravening maw, and he may condescend to signify that it is his pleasure to be awake, and ready to receive the proposals of his high and mighty clients for the terms on which he may respite the execution of the sentence he has passed upon them. Whatever may come of the object of all this suit and service, there seems to me a wonderful <Q REND="inline">"alacrity in sinking."</Q> To submit to be so treated is to be humbled indeed. It is to sink many degrees below Zero in the de|scending scale of political degradation. I never knew dignity much.</P>
<P>Our proceeding, which has produced this re|turn, appeared to me totally new, without being adapted to the new circumstances of affairs. I have called to my mind the speeches and messages in former times. I find nothing like these. Before this time, never was a ground of peace laid, as it were, in a parliamentary record, until it had been as good as concluded. This was a wise homage
<PB N="12" REF="18">
paid to the discretion of the Crown. It was known how much any negotiation must suffer by having any thing in the train towards it prematurely dis|closed.</P>
<P>I conceive that another circumstance in that transaction has been as little authorised by any example, and that it is as little prudent in itself; I mean the formal recognition of the French Re|publick. Without entering, for the present, into a question on the good faith manifested in that measure, or on it's general policy, I doubt, upon mere prudential considerations, whether it was perfectly adviseable. It is not within the rules of dexterous conduct to make an acknowledgment of a contested title in your enemy, before you are morally certain that your recognition will secure his friendship. Otherwise it is a measure worse than thrown away. It adds infinitely to the strength, and consequently to the demands of the adverse party. He has gained a fundamental point without an equivalent.</P>
<P>This sort of preliminary declarations, thrown out at random, and sown, as it were, broad cast, were never to be found in the mode of our pro|ceeding with France and Spain, whilst the great Monarchies of France and Spain existed. I do not say, that a diplomatick measure ought to be, like
<PB N="13" REF="19">
a parliamentary or a judicial proceeding, accor|ding to strict precedent. I hope I am far from that pedantry: but this I know, that a great state ought to have some regard to it's antient maxims; especially where they indicate it's dignity; where they concur with the rules of prudence; and above all, where the circumstances of the time require that a spirit of innovation should be resisted, which leads to the humiliation of sovereign powers. It would be ridiculous to assert, that those powers have suffered nothing in their estimation. I admit, that the greater interests of state will for a moment su|persede all other considerations: but if there was a rule that a sovereign never should let down his dignity without a sure payment to his interest, the dignity of Kings would be held high enough. At present, however, fashion governs in more serious things than furniture and dress. It looks as if so|vereigns abroad were emulous in bidding against their estimation. It seems as if the pre-eminence of Regicide was acknowleged; and that Kings tacitly ranked themselves below their sacrilegious murderers, as natural magistrates and judges over them. It appears as if dignity were the pre|rogative of crime; and a temporising humiliation the proper part for venerable authority. If the vilest of mankind are resolved to be the most wick|ed, they lose all the baseness of their origin, and take their place above Kings. This example in fo|reign
<PB N="14" REF="20">
Princes, I trust, will not spread. It is the concern of mankind, that the destruction of order should not be a claim to rank; that crimes should not be the only title to pre-eminence and honour.</P>
<P>If what I hear be true, the Mini&s;ters are not quite so much to be blamed, as their condition is to be lamented. I have been given to understand, that these proceedings are not in their origin pro|perly theirs. It is said that there is a secret in the House of Commons. That Ministers act not ac|cording to the votes, but according to the dispo|sitions, of the majority. I hear that the minority has long since spoken the general sense of the na|tion; and that to prevent those who compose it from having the open and avowed lead in that House, or perhaps in both Houses, it was necessary to pre-occupy their ground, and to take their pro|positions out of their mouths.</P>
<P>If the general disposition of the people be, as I hear it is, for an immediate peace with Regicide without so much as considering our publick and solemn engagements to the parties, or any enquiry into the terms, it is all over with us. It is strange, but it may be true, that as the danger from ad|vances to Jacobinism is increased in my eyes and in yours, the fear of it is lessened in theirs. It seems, they act under the impression of other sort
<PB N="15" REF="21">
of terrors, which frighten them out of their first apprehensions: but it is fit they should recollect, that they who would make peace without a pre|vious knowledge of the terms, make a surrender. They are conquered. They do not treat; they re|ceive the law. Then the people of England are con|tented to seek in the kindness of a foreign syste|matick enemy combined with a dangerous faction at home, a security which they cannot find in their own patriotism and their own courage. They are willing trust to the sympathy of Regicides, the guarantee of the British Monarchy. They are con|tent to rest their religion on the piety of atheists by establishment. They are satisfied to seek in the cle|mency of practised murderers the security of their lives. They are pleased to confide their property to the safeguard of those who are robbers by incli|nation, interest, habit, and system. If this be our deliberate mind, truly we deserve to lose, what we cannot long retain, the name of a nation.</P>
<P>In matters of state, a constitutional competence to act, is in many cases the smallest part of the question. Without disputing (God forbid I should dispute) the sole competence of the King and the Parliament, each in it's province, to decide on war and peace, I venture to say, no war <HI>can</HI> be long carried on against the will of the people. This war, in particular, cannot be carried on unless
<PB N="16" REF="22">
they are enthusiastically in favour of it. Acqui|escence will not do. There must be zeal. Uni|versal zeal in such a cause, and at such a time as this is, cannot be looked for; neither is it neces|sary. A zeal in the larger part carries the force of the whole. Without this, no Government, cer|tainly not our Government, is capable of a great war. None of the ancient regular Governments has wherewithal to fight abroad with a foreign foe, and at home to overcome repining, reluctance, and chicane. It must be some portentousthing, like Re|gicide France, that can exhibit such a prodigy. Yet even she, the mother of monsters, more proli|fic than the country of old called <HI>Feraxmonstrorum,</HI> shews symptoms of being almost effete already; and she will be so, unless the fallow of a peace comes to recruit her fertility. But whatever may be represented concerning the meanness of the popular spirit, I, for one, do not think so despe|rately of the British nation. Our minds are light, but they are not evil. We are dreadfully open to delusion and to dejection; but we are capable of being animated and undeceived.</P>
<P>It cannot be concealed. We are a divided people. But in divisions, where a part is to be taken, we are to make a muster of our strength. I have often endeavoured to class those who, in any political view, are to be called the people.
<PB N="17" REF="23">
Without doing &s;omething of this &s;ort we mu&s;t proceed ab&s;urdly. We &s;hould pre&s;ume as ab|&s;urdly, if we pretended to very great accuracy in our e&s;timate. But I think, in the calculation I have made, the error cannot be very material. In England and Scotland, I compute that tho&s;e of adult age, not declining in life, of tolerable lei&s;ure for &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and of &s;ome means of infor|mation, more or le&s;s, and who are above menial dependence, (or what virtually is &s;uch) may amount to about four hundred thou&s;and. In this number I include the women that take a concern in tho&s;e tran&s;actions, who cannot exceed twenty thou&s;and. There is &s;uch a thing as a natural re|pre&s;entative of the people. This body is that re|pre&s;entative; and on this body, more than on the legal con&s;tituent, the artificial repre&s;entative de|pends. This is the Briti&s;h publick; and it is a publick very numerous. The re&s;t, when feeble, are the objects of protection; when &s;trong, the means of force. They who affect to con&s;ider that part of us in any other light, in&s;ult while they cajole us; they do not want us for coun&s;ellors in deliberation, but to li&s;t us as &s;oldiers for battle.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e four hundred thou&s;and political citi|zens, I look upon one fifth, or about eighty thou|&s;and, to be pure Jacobins; utterly incapable of amendment; objects of eternal vigilance; and
<PB N="18" REF="24">
when they break out, of legal con&s;traint. On the&s;e, no rea&s;on, no argument, no example, no venerable authority, can have the &s;lighte&s;t influ|ence. They de&s;ire a change; and they will have it if they can. If they cannot have it by Engli&s;h cabal, they will make no &s;ort of &s;cruple of having it by the cabal of France, into which already they are virtually incorporated.</P>
<P>This minority is great and formidable. I do not know whether if I aimed at the total over|throw of a kingdom, I &s;hould wi&s;h to be encum|bered with a larger body of partizans. The&s;e, by their &s;pirit of intrigue, and by their re&s;tle&s;s agitating activity, are of a force far &s;uperior to their numbers; and if times grew the lea&s;t criti|cal, have the means of debauching or intimidat|ing many of tho&s;e who are now &s;ound, as well as of adding to their force large bodies of the more pa&s;&s;ive part of the nation. This minority is nu|merous enough to make a mighty cry for peace, or for war, or for any object they are led vehe|mently to de&s;ire. By pa&s;&s;ing from place to place with a velocity incredible, and diver&s;ifying their character and de&s;cription, they are capable of mimicking the general voice. We mu&s;t not al|ways judge of the generality of the opinion by the noi&s;e of the acclamation.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="25">
The majority, the other four fifths, is perfectly &s;ound; and of the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;po&s;itions to re|ligion, to government, to the true and undivided intere&s;t of their country. Such men are naturally di&s;po&s;ed to peace. They who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all they wi&s;h, are languid and improvident. With this fault, (and I admit it's exi&s;tence in all its extent) they would not endure to hear of a peace that led to the ruin of every thing for which peace is dear to them. However, the de|&s;ire of peace is e&s;&s;entially the weak &s;ide of all &s;uch men. All men that are ruined, are ruined on the &s;ide of their natural propen&s;ities. There they are unguarded. They do not &s;u&s;pect that their de&s;truction is attempted through their virtues. This their enemies are perfectly aware of&mdash;and accordingly they, the mo&s;t turbulent of mankind, who never made a &s;cruple to &s;hake the tranqui|lity of their country to its centre, rai&s;e a con|tinual cry for peace with France. Peace with Regicide, and war with the re&s;t of the world, is their true motto. From the beginning, and even whil&s;t the French gave the blows, and we hardly oppo&s;ed the <HI>vis inertiae</HI> to their efforts, from that day to this hour, like importunate Guinea-fowls crying one note day and night, they have called for a Regicide peace.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="26">
In this they are, as I confe&s;s in all things they are, perfectly con&s;i&s;tent. They who wi&s;h to unite them&s;elves to your enemies, naturally de|&s;ire, that you &s;hould di&s;arm your&s;elf by a peace with the&s;e enemies. But it pa&s;&s;es my conception, how they, who wi&s;h well to their country on it's ancient &s;y&s;tem of laws and manners, come not to be doubly alarmed, when they find nothing but a clamor for peace, in the mouths of the men on earth the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to it in their natural or in their habitual character.</P>
<P>I have a good opinion of the general abilities of the Jacobins: not that I &s;uppo&s;e them better born than others; but &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions awake the fa|culties. They &s;uffer not a particle of the man to be lo&s;t. The &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e gives them the full u&s;e of all their native energies. If I have rea&s;on to conceive that my enemy, who, as &s;uch, mu&s;t have an intere&s;t in my de&s;truction, is al&s;o a per&s;on of di&s;cernment and &s;agacity, then I mu&s;t be quite &s;ure, that in a conte&s;t, the object he violently pur&s;ues, is the very thing by which my ruin is the mo&s;t perfectly accompli&s;hed. Why do the Jacobins cry for peace? Becau&s;e they know, that this point gained, the re&s;t will follow of cour&s;e. On our part why are all the rules of prudence, as &s;ure as the laws of material nature to be at this time rever&s;ed? How comes it, that now
<PB N="21" REF="27">
for the fir&s;t time, men think it right to be governed by the coun&s;els of their enemies? Ought they not rather to tremble, when they are per&s;uaded to tra|vel on the &s;ame road; and to tend to the &s;ame place of re&s;t?</P>
<P>The minority I &s;peak of, is not &s;u&s;ceptible of an impre&s;&s;ion from the topics of argument, to be u&s;ed to the larger part of the community. I therefore do not addre&s;s to them any part of what I have to &s;ay. The more forcibly I drive my arguments again&s;t their &s;y&s;tem, &s;o as to make an impre&s;&s;ion where I wi&s;h to make it, the more &s;trongly I rivet them in their &s;entiments. As for us, who compo&s;e the far larger, and what I call the far better part of the people; let me &s;ay, that we have not been quite fairly dealt with when called to this deli|beration. The Jacobin minority have been abun|dantly &s;upplied with &s;tores and provi&s;ions of all kinds towards their warfare. No &s;ort of argumen|tative materials, &s;uited to their purpo&s;es, have been withheld. Fal&s;e they are, un&s;ound, &s;ophi&s;tical; but they are regular in their direction. They all bear one way; and they all go to the &s;upport of the &s;ub&s;tantial merits of their cau&s;e. The others have not had the que&s;tion &s;o much as fairly &s;tated to them.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="28">
There has not been in this century, any foreign peace or war in it's origin, the fruit of popular de&s;ire: except the war that was made with Spain in 1739. Sir Robert Walpole was forced into the war by the people who were inflamed to this mea&s;ure by the mo&s;t leading politicians, by the fir&s;t orators, and the greate&s;t poets of the time. For that war, Pope &s;ung his dying notes. For that war, John&s;on in more energetic &s;trains, employed the voice of his early genius. For that war, Glover di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the way in which his mu&s;e was the mo&s;t natural and happy. The crowd readily followed the politi|cians in the cry for a war, which threatened little blood&s;hed, and which promi&s;ed victories that were attended with &s;omething more &s;olid than glory. A war with Spain was a war of plunder. In the pre&s;ent conflict with Regicide, Mr. Pitt has not had, nor will for &s;ome little time have, many prizes to hold out in the lottery of war, to tempt the lower part of our character. He can only maintain it by an appeal to the higher; and to tho&s;e, in whom that higher part is mo&s;t predominant, he mu&s;t look the mo&s;t for his &s;upport. Whil&s;t he holds out no inducements to the wi&s;e, nor bribes to the avari|cious, he may be forced by a vulgar cry into a peace ten times more ruinous than the mo&s;t di&s;|a&s;trous war. The weaker he is in the fund of mo|tives which apply to our avarice, to our lazine&s;s,
<PB N="23" REF="29">
and to our la&s;&s;itude, if he means to carry the war to any end at all, the &s;tronger he ought to be in his addre&s;&s;es to our magnanimity and to our rea&s;on.</P>
<P>In &s;tating that Walpole was driven by a popular clamour into a mea&s;ure not to be ju&s;tified, I do not mean wholly to excu&s;e his conduct. My time of ob&s;ervation did not exactly coincide with that event; but I read much of the controver&s;ies then carried on. Several years after the conte&s;ts of par|ties had cea&s;ed, the people were amu&s;ed, and in a degree warmed with them. The events of that aera &s;eemed then of magnitude, which the revolu|tions of our time have reduced to parochial im|portance; and the debates, which then &s;hook the nation, now appear of no higher moment than a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in a ve&s;try. When I was very young, a general fa&s;hion told me I was to admire &s;ome of the writings again&s;t that Mini&s;ter; a little more maturity taught me as much to de&s;pi&s;e them. I ob&s;erved one fault in his general proceeding. He never manfully put forward the entire &s;trength of his cau&s;e. He tempori&s;ed; he managed; and adopting very nearly the &s;entiments of his adver&s;a|ries, he oppo&s;ed their inferences.&mdash;This, for a po|litical commander, is the choice of a weak po&s;t. His adver&s;aries had the better of the argument, as he handled it, not as the rea&s;on and ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e enabled him to manage it. I &s;ay this after
<PB N="24" REF="30">
having &s;een, and with &s;ome care examined, the ori|ginal documents concerning certain important tran&s;actions of tho&s;e times. They perfectly &s;ati&s;|fied me of the extreme inju&s;tice of that war, and of the fal&s;ehood of the colours, which to his own ruin, and guided by a mi&s;taken policy, he &s;uf|fered to be daubed over that mea&s;ure. Some years after, it was my fortune, to conver&s;e with many of the principal actors again&s;t that Mini&s;ter, and with tho&s;e, who principally excited that clamour. None of them, no not one, did in the lea&s;t defend the mea&s;ure, or attempt to ju&s;tify their conduct, which they as freely condemned as they would have done in commenting upon any proceeding in hi&s;|tory, in which they were totally unconcerned. Thus it will be. They who &s;tir up the people to improper de&s;ires, whether of peace or war, will be condemned by them&s;elves. They who weakly yield to them will be condemned by hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>In my opinion, the pre&s;ent mini&s;try are as far from doing full ju&s;tice to their cau&s;e in this war, as Walpole was from doing ju&s;tice to the peace which at that time he was willing to pre&s;erve. They throw the light on one &s;ide only of their ca&s;e; though it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould not ob&s;erve, that the other &s;ide which is kept in the &s;hade, has it's importance too. They mu&s;t know, that France is formidable, not only as &s;he is France,
<PB N="25" REF="31">
but as she is Jacobin France. They knew from the beginning that the Jacobin party was not confined to that country. They knew, they felt, the strong dispositions of the same faction in both countries to communicate and to co-ope|rate. For some time past, these two points have been kept, and even industriously kept, out of sight. France is considered as merely a foreign Power; and the seditious English only as a domes|tick faction. The merits of the war with the for|mer have been argued solely on political grounds. To prevent our being corrupted with the mischiev|ous doctrines of the latter, matter and argument have been supplied abundantly, and even to sur|feit on the excellency of our own government. But nothing has been done to make us feel in what manner the safety of that Government is connected with the principle and with the issue of this war. For any thing, which in the late dis|cussion has appeared, the war is intirely collateral to the state of Jacobinism; as truly a foreign war to us and to all our home concerns, as the war with Spain in 1739, about Gard da Costas, the Madrid Convention, and the fable of Captain <HI>Jenkins's</HI> ears.</P>
<P>Some who are advocates at once for Govern|ment, and for peace with the enemies of all Go|vernment, have even gone the length of consider|ing
<PB N="26" REF="32">
the proceedings in France, if at all they af|fect us, as rather advantageous to the cause of tranquillity and good order in this country. But I reserve my observations on this very extraordinary topic of argument to another occasion: it is now my business to point out to you, that when|ever the adverse party has raised a cry for peace with the Regicide, the answer has been little more than this, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the Administration wished for such a peace, full as much as the Opposition; but that the time was not convenient for making it."</Q> Whatever else has been said was much in the same spirit. Reasons of this kind never touched the sub|stantial merits of the war. They where in the na|ture of dilatory pleas, exceptions of form, and pre|vious questions. Accordingly all the arguments against a compliance with the popular desires, (urg|ed on with all possible vehemence and earnestness by the Jacobins) have appeared flat and languid, feeble and evasive. They appeared to aim only at gaining time. They never entered into the pe|culiar and distinctive character of the war. They spoke neither to the understanding nor to the heart. Cold as ice themselves, they never could kindle in our breasts a spark of that zeal, which is necessary to a conflict with an adverse zeal; much less are they made to infuse into our minds, that stubborn persevering spirit, which alone is capable of bear|ing up against those vicissitudes of fortune, that will
<PB N="27" REF="33">
probably occur, and those burthens which must be inevitably borne in a long war. I speak it empha|tically, and with a desire that it should be marked, in a <HI>long</HI> war; because, without such a war, no ex|perience has yet told us, that a dangerous power has ever been reduced to measure or to reason. I do not throw back my view to the Peloponnesian war of twenty-seven years; nor to two of the Pu|nick wars, the first of twenty-four, the second of eighteen; nor to the more recent war concluded by the treaty of Westphalia, which continued, I think, for thirty. I go to what is but just fallen behind living memory, and immediately touches our own country. Let the portion of our history from the year 1689 to 1713 be brought before us. We shall find, that in all that pe|riod of twenty-four years, there were not above six that could be called an interval of peace; and this interval was in reality nothing more than a very active preparation for war. During that pe|riod, every one of the propositions of peace came from the enemy. The first, when they were ac|cepted, at the peace of Ryswick. The second, where they were rejected at the congress at Ger|trudenburgh. The last, when the war ended by the treaty of Utrecht. Even then, a very great part of the nation, and that which contained by far the most intelligent statesmen, was against the conclusion of the war. I do not enter into the
<PB N="28" REF="34">
merits of that question as between the parties. I only state the existence of that opinion as a fact. I mention the length of the war as a proof, that though the countries which now compose the kingdom, for a part of the time were not united, and through all the time continued with a raw and ill cemented union, and though they were further split into parties as vehement, and more equally divided than now they are, and that we were possessed of far less abundant resources in all kinds than we now enjoy.&mdash;I mean to mark, that under all these disadvantages the English nation was then a great people; that we had then an high mind, and a constancy unconquerable; that we were then inspired with no flashy passions, but such as were durable as well as warm; such as cor|responded to the great interests we had at stake. This force of character was inspired, as all such spirit must ever be, from above. Government gave the impulse. As well may we fancy that of itself the sea will swell, and without winds the billows will insult the adverse shore, as that the gross mass of the people will be moved and elevated without the influence of superior authority, or superior mind.</P>
<P>This impulse ought, in my opinion, to have been given in this war; and it ought to have been con|tinued to it at every instant. It is made. if ever
<PB N="29" REF="35">
war was made, to touch all the great springs of action in the human breast. It ought not to have been a war of apology. The minister had, in this conflict wherewithal to glory in success; to be consoled in adversity; to hold high his principle in all fortunes. If it were not given him to sup|port the falling edifice, he ought to bury himself under the ruins of the civilized world. All the art of Greece, and all the pride and power of eastern Monarchs, never heaped upon their ashes so grand a monument.</P>
<P>There were days when his great mind was up to the crisis of the world he is called to act in. His manly eloquence was equal to the elevated wisdom of such sentiments. But the little have triumphed over the great; an unnatural, not an unusual victory. I am sure you cannot forget with how much uneasiness we heard in conversation, the language of more than one gentleman at the opening of this contest, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he was willing to try the war for a year or two, and if it did not succeed, then to vote for peace."</Q> As if war was a matter of experiment! As if you could take it up or lay it down as an idle frolick! As if the dire goddess that presides over it, with her mur|derous spear in her hand, and her gorgon at her breast, was a coquette to be flirted with! We ought with reverence to approach that tremendous
<PB N="30" REF="36">
divinity, that loves courage, but commands coun|sel. War never leaves a nation where it was found. The interval between that and peace is indeed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a very hideous dream, in which the ge|nius and the mortal instruments are seriously at work."</Q> It is never to be entered into without a mature deliberation; not a deliberation lengthened out into a perplexing indecision, but a deliberation leading to a sure and fixed judgment. When so taken up it is not to be abandoned without reason as valid, as fully, and as extensively considered; for peace may be made as unadvisedly as war. No|thing is so rash as fear: and the counsels of pusil|lanimity very rarely put off, whilst they are al|ways sure to aggravate the evils they would fly from.</P>
<P>In that great war carried on against Louis the XIVth, for near eighteen years Government spared no pains to satisfy the people, that though they were to be animated by a desire of glory, glory was not their ultimate object: but that every thing dear to them, in religion, in law, in liberty, every thing which as freemen, as Englishmen, and as citizens of the great commonwealth of Christen|dom, they had at heart, was then at stake. Whe|ther they did not exaggerate the danger I will not dispute. A danger, and no small danger, unques|tionably there was; and that long and arduous war was pursued, upon at least as solid and manly
<PB N="31" REF="37">
grounds, as the peace was made which put an end to it. A danger to avert a danger&mdash;a present incon|venience and suffering to prevent a foreseen fu|ture, and a worse calamity&mdash;these are the motives that belong to an animal, who, in his constitution, is at once adventurous and provident; circum|spect, and daring; whom his Creator has made, as the Poet says, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of large discourse, looking be|fore and after."</Q> But never can a vehement and sustained spirit of fortitude be kindled in a people by a war of calculation. It has nothing that can keep the mind erect under the gusts of adversity. Even where men are willing, as sometimes they are, to barter their blood for lucre, to hazard their safety to gratify their avarice, that passion, like all the passions, must see it's objects distinct and near at hand. The passions are hungry and impatient. Speculative plunder; contingent spoil; future long adjourned uncertain booty; pillage which must en|rich a late posterity, and which possibly may not reach to posterity at all; these, for any length of time, will never support a mercenary war. The people are in the right. The calculation of profit in all such wars is false. On balancing the ac|count of such wars, ten thousand hogsheads of sugar are purchased at ten thousand times their price. The blood of man should never be shed but to redeem the blood of man. It is well shed for our family, for our friends, for our God, for
<PB N="32" REF="38">
our country, for our kind. The rest is vanity; the rest is crime.</P>
<P>In the war of the Grand Alliance, most of these considerations voluntarily and naturally had their part. Some were pressed into the service. The political interest easily went in the track of the natural sentiment. In the reverse course the car|riage does not follow freely. I am sure the natu|ral feeling, as I have just said, is a far more pre|dominant ingredient in this war, than in that of any other that ever was waged by this kingdom.</P>
<P>If the war made to prevent the union of two crowns upon one head was a just war, this, which is made to prevent the tearing all crowns from all heads which ought to wear them, and with the crowns to smite off the sacred heads themselves, this is a just war.</P>
<P>If a war to prevent Louis the XIVth from im|posing his religion was just, a war to prevent the murderers of Louis the XVIth from imposing their irreligion upon us is just; a war to prevent the operation of a system, which makes life without dignity, and death without hope, is a just war.</P>
<P>If to preserve political independence and ci|vil freedom to nations, was a just ground of war;
<PB N="33" REF="39">
a war to preserve national independence, property, liberty, life, and honour, from certain universal havock, is a war just, necessary, manly, pious; and we are bound to persevere in it by every principle, divine and human, as long as the system which menaces them all, and all equally, has an existence in the world.</P>
<P>You, who have looked at this matter with as fair and impartial an eye as can be united with a feel|ing heart, you will not think it an hardy assertion, when I affirm, that it were far better to be con|quered by any other nation, than to have this fac|tion for a neighbour. Before I felt myself autho|rised to say this, I considered the state of all the countries in Europe for these last three hundred years, which have been obliged to submit to a fo|reign law. In most of those I found the condition of the annexed countries even better, certainly not worse, than the lot of those which were the patrimony of the conqueror. They wanted some blessings&mdash;but they were free from many very great evils. They were rich and tranquil. Such was Artois, Flanders, Lorrain, Alsatia, un|der the old Government of France. Such was Silesia under the King of Prussia. They who are to live in the vicinity of France, are to prepare to live in perpetual conspiracies and seditions; and to end at last, in being conquered, if not to
<PB N="34" REF="40">
her dominion, to her resemblance. But when we talk of conquest by other nations, it is only to put a case. This is the only power in Europe by which it is <HI>possible</HI> we should be conquered. To live under the continual dread of such immeasureable evils is itself a grievous calamity. To live without the dread of them, is to turn the danger into the disaster. The influence of such a France is equal to a war; it's example, more wasting than an hos|tile irruption. The hostility with any other state is separable and accidental; this state, by the very condition of it's existence, by it's very essential constitution, is in a state of hostility with us, and with all civilized people.</P>
<P>A Government of the nature of that set up at our very door has never been hitherto seen, or even imagined in Europe. What our relation to it will be cannot be judged by other relations. It is a serious thing to have a connexion with a people, who live only under positive, arbitrary, and changeable institutions; and those not perfected nor supplied, nor explained by any common ac|knowledged rule of moral science. I remember that in one of my last conversations with the late Lord Camden, we were struck much in the same manner with the abolition in France of the law, as a science of methodized and artificial equity. France, since her Revolution, is under the sway of
<PB N="35" REF="41">
a sect, whose leaders have deliberately, at one stroke, demolished the whole body of that juris|prudence which France had pretty nearly in com|mon with other civilized countries. In that juris|prudence were contained the elements and princi|ples of the law of nations, the great ligament of mankind. With the law they have of course de|stroyed all seminaries in which jurisprudence was taught, as well as all the corporations established for its conservation. I have not heard of any coun|try, whether in Europe or Asia, or even in Africa on this side of Mount Atlas, which is wholly with|out some such colleges and such corporations, except France. No man, in a public or private concern, can divine by what rule or principle her judgments are to be directed; nor is there to be found a Professor in any University, or a Practi|tioner in any Court, who will hazard an opinion of what is or is not law in France, in any case what|ever. They have not only annulled all their old treaties; but they have renounced the law of na|tions from whence treaties have their force. With a fixed design they have outlawed themselves, and to their power outlawed all other nations. Instead of the religion and the law by which they were in a great and politick communion with the Christian world, they have constructed their Republick on three basis; all fundamentally opposite to those on which the communities of Europe are built. It's
<PB N="36" REF="42">
foundation is laid in Regicide; in Jacobinism; and in Atheism; and it has joined to those prin|ciples, a body of systematick manners which se|cures their operation.</P>
<P>If I am asked how I would be understood in the use of those terms, Regicide, Jacobinism, A|theism, and a system of correspondent manners and their establishment, I will tell you.</P>
<P>I call a commonwealth <HI>Regicide,</HI> which lays it down as a fixed law of nature, and a fundamen|tal right of man, that all government, not being a democracy, is an usurpation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing could be more solemn than their promulgation of this principle as a preamble to the destructive code of their famous articles for the decomposition of society into whatever country they should enter. <Q REND="inline">"La Convention Nationale, apr&egrave;s avoir entendu le rapport de ses Comit&eacute;s de Finances, de la guerre, &amp; diplomatique r&eacute;unis, fidelle <HI>au principe de souve|rainet&eacute; du peuple qui ne lui permet pas de reconno&icirc;tre aucune institu|tion qui y porte atteinte,</HI>" <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></Q> D&eacute;cret sur le Rapport de Cambon. Dec. 18, 1792.</NOTE>. That all Kings, as such, are usurpers; and for being Kings, may and ought to be put to death, with their wives, fa|milies, and adherents. The commonwealth which acts uniformly upon those principles, and which af|ter abolishing every festival of religion, chooses the most flagrant act of a murderous Regicide treason for a feast of eternal commemoration, and which
<PB N="37" REF="43">
forces all her people to observe it.&mdash;<HI>This I call Regicide by establishment.</HI></P>
<P>Jacobinism is the revolt of the enterprising ta|lents of a country against it's property. When private men form themselves into associations for the purpose of destroying the pre-existing laws and institutions of their country; when they se|cure to themselves an army by dividing amongst the people of no property, the estates of the an|cient and lawful proprietors; when a state recog|nizes those acts; when it does not make confis|cations for crimes, but makes crimes for confisca|tions; when it has it's principal strength, and all it's resources in such a violation of property; when it stands chiefly upon such a violation; massacring by judgments, or otherwise, those who make any struggle for their old legal government, and their legal, hereditary, or acquired possessions, I call this <HI>Jacobinism by establishment.</HI></P>
<P>I call it <HI>Atheism by establishment,</HI> when any State, as such, shall not acknowledge the existence of God as a moral Governor of the World; when it shall offer to Him no religious or moral worship;&mdash;when it shall abolish the Christian religion by a regular decree;&mdash;when it shall persecute with a cold, unrelenting, steady cruelty, by every mode of confiscation, imprisonment, exile, and death,
<PB N="38" REF="44">
all its ministers;&mdash;when it shall generally shut up or pull down churches; when the few buildings which remain of this kind shall be opened only for the purpose of making a profane apotheosis of monsters, whose vices and crimes have no parallel amongst men, and whom all other men consider as objects of general detestation, and the severest animadversion of law. When, in the place of that religion of social benevolence, and of individual self-denial, in mockery of all religion, they insti|tute impious, blasphemous, indecent theatric rites in honor of their vitiated, perverted reason, and erect altars to the personification of their own corrupted and bloody Republick;&mdash;when schools and seminaries are erected at public expence to poison mankind, from generation to generation, with the horrible maxims of this impiety, I call this <HI>Atbeism by establishment.</HI></P>
<P>When to these establishments of Regicide, of Jacobinism, and of Atheism, you add the <HI>corres|pondent system of manners,</HI> no doubt can be left on the mind of a thinking man, concerning their de|termined hostility to the human race. Manners are of more importance than laws. In a great mea|sure the laws depend upon them. The law touches us but here and there, and now and then. Man|ners are what vex or sooth, corrupt or purify, exalt or debase, barbarize or refine us, by a con|stant, steady, uniform, insensible operation, like
<PB N="39" REF="45">
that of the air we breath in. They give their whole form and colour to our lives. According to their quality, they aid morals, they supply them, or they totally destroy them. Of this the new French Legislators were aware; therefore, with the same method, and under the same authority, they settled a system of manners, the most licen|tious, prostitute, and abandoned, and at the same time the most coarse, rude, savage, and ferocious. Nothing in the Revolution, no, not to a phrase or a gesture, not to the fashion of a hat or a shoe, was left to accident. All was the result of design; all was matter of institution. No mechanical means could be devised in favour of this incredi|ble system of wickedness and vice, that has not been employed. The noblest passions, the love of glory, the love of country, were debauched into means of it's preservation and it's propagation. All sorts of shews and exhibitions calculated to in|flame and vitiate the imagination, and pervert the moral sense, have been contrived. They have sometimes brought forth five or six hundred drunken women, calling at the bar of the Assem|bly for the blood of their own children, as being royalists or constitutionals. Sometimes they have got a body of wretches, calling themselves fathers, to demand the murder of their sons; boasting that Rome had but one Brutus, but that they could shew five hundred. There were instances, in
<PB N="40" REF="46">
which they inverted, and retaliated the impiety, and produced sons, who called for the execution of their parents. The foundation of their Repu|blick is founded in moral paradoxes. Their pa|triotism is always prodigy. All those instances to be found in history, whether real or fabulous, of a doubtful publick spirit, at which morality is perplexed, reason is staggered, and from which a frighted nature recoils, are their chosen, and almost sole examples for the instruction of their youth.</P>
<P>The whole drift of their institution is contrary to that of the wise Legislators of all countries, who aimed at improving instincts into morals, and at grafting the virtues on the stock of the natural af|fections. They, on the contrary, have omitted no pains to eradicate every benevolent and noble pro|pensity in the mind of men. In their culture it is a rule always to graft virtues on vices. They think everything unworthy of the name of publick virtue, unless it indicates violence on the private. All their new institutions, (and with them every thing is new) strike at the root of our social nature. Other Legislators, knowing that marriage is the origin of all relations, and consequently the first element of all duties, have endeavoured by every art to make it sacred. The Christian Religion, by confining it to the pairs, and by rendering that relation indisso|luble, has, by these two things, done more towards
<PB N="41" REF="47">
the peace, happiness, settlement, and civilization of the world, than by any other part in this whole scheme of Divine Wisdom. The direct contrary course was taken in the Synagogue of Antichrist, I mean in that forge and manufactory of all evil, the sect which predominated in the Constituent Assembly of 1789. Those monsters employed the same, or greater industry, to desecrate and degrade that State, which other Legislators have used to render it holy and honourable. By a strange, uncalled for declaration, they pronounced, that marriage was no better than a common, civil contract. It was one of their ordinary tricks, to put their sentiments into the mouths of certain personated characters, which they theatrically exhibited at the bar of what ought to be a serious Assembly. One of these was brought out in the figure of a prostitute, whom they called by the affected name of <Q REND="inline">"a mother without being a wife."</Q> This creature they made to call for a repeal of the incapacities, which in civilized States are put upon bastards. The prostitutes of the As|sembly gave to this their puppet the sanction of their greater impudence. In consequence of the principles laid down, and the manners authorised, bastards were not long after put on the footing of the issue of lawful unions. Proceeding in the &s;pi|rit of the first authors of their constitution, they went the full length of the principle, and gave a
<PB N="42" REF="48">
licence to divorce at the mere pleasure of either party, and at four day's notice. With them the matrimonial connexion was brought into so de|graded a state of concubinage, that, I believe, none of the wretches in London, who keep warehouses of infamy, would give out one of their victims to private custody on so short and insolent a tenure. There was indeed a kind of profligate equity in thus giving to women the same licentious power. The reason they assigned was as infamous as the act, declaring that women had been too long under the tyranny of parents and of husbands. It is not ne|cessary to observe upon the horrible consequen|ces of taking one half of the species wholly out of the guardianship and protection of the other.</P>
<P>The practice of divorce, though in some coun|tries permitted, has been discouraged in all. In the East, polygamy and divorce are in discredit; and the manners correct the laws. In Rome, were divorce was allowed, some hundreds of years had passed, without a single example of that kind. Of this circumstance they were pleased to take notice, as an inducement to adopt their regulation: hold|ing out an hope, that the permission would as rarely be made use of. They knew the contrary to be true; and they had taken good care, that the laws should be well seconded by the manners. Their law of divorce, like all their laws, had not for it's object
<PB N="43" REF="49">
the relief of domestick uneasiness, but the total corruption of all morals, the total disconnection of social life.</P>
<P>It is a matter of curiosity to observe the opera|tion of this encouragement to disorder. I have be|fore me the Paris paper, correspondent to the usu|al register of births, marriages, and deaths. Di|vorce, happily, is no regular head of registry a|mongst civilized nations. With the Jacobins it is remarkable, that divorce is not only a regular head but it has the post of honour. It occupies the first place in the list. In the three first months of the year 1793, the number of divorces amounted to 562. The marriages were 1785; so that the pro|portion of divorces to marriages was not much less than one to three. A thing unexampled, I believe, amongst mankind. I caused an enquiry to be made at Doctor's Commons, concerning the num|ber of divorces; and found that all the divorces, (which except by special act of Parliament, are separations, and not proper divorces) did not amount for all England, and in an hundred years, to much more than one fifth of those that passed, in the single city of Paris, in three months. I fol|lowed up the enquiry through several of the sub|sequent months until I was tired, and found the proportions still the same. By this we may take our estimate of the havock that has been made
<PB N="44" REF="50">
through all the relations of life. With the Jaco|bins of France, vague intercourse is without re|proach; marriage is reduced to the vilest concu|binage; children are encouraged to cut the throats of their parents; mothers are taught that tenderness is no part of their character; and to demonstrate their attatchment to their party, that they ought to make no scruple to rake wtih their bloody hands in the bowels of those who came from their own.</P>
<P>To all this let us join the practice of <HI>canniba|lism,</HI> with which, in the proper terms, and with the greatest truth, their several factions accuse each other. By cannibalism, I mean their devour|ing, as a nutriment of their ferocity, some part of the bodies of those they have murdered; their drinking the blood of their victims, and forcing the victims themselves to drink the blood of their kindred slaughtered before their faces. By canni|balism, I mean also to signify their nameless, un|manly and abominable insults on the bodies of those they slaughter.</P>
<P>As to those whom they suffer to die a natural death, they do not suffer them to enjoy the last con|solations of mankind, or those rights of sepulture, which indicate hope, and which meer nature has taught to mankind in all countries. to soothe the
<PB N="45" REF="51">
afflictions, and to cover the infirmity of moral condition. They disgrace men in the entry into life; they vitiate and enslave them through the whole course of it; and they deprive them of all comfort at the conclusion of their dishonoured and depraved existence. Endeavouring to per|suade the people that they are no better than beasts; the whole body of their institution tends to make them beasts of prey furious and savage. For this purpose the active part of them is disci|plined into a ferocity which has no parallel. To this ferocity there is joined not one of the rude, unfashioned virtues, which accompany the vices, where the whole are left to grow up together in the rankness of uncultivated nature. But nothing is left to nature in their systems.</P>
<P>The same discipline which hardens their hearts relaxes their morals. Whilst courts of justice were thrust out by revolutionary tribunals, and silent churches were only the funeral monuments of departed religion, no fewer than ten theatres were kept open at publick expence. At one time I have reckoned fourteen of their advertisements of publick diversion. Among the gaunt, hag|gard forms of famine and nakedness, amidst the yells of murder, the tears of affliction, and the cries of despair, the song, the dance, the mimick scene, the buffoon laughter, went on as regularly
<PB N="46" REF="52">
as in the gay hour of festive peace. I have it from good authority, that under the scaffold of judicial murder, and the gaping planks that poured down blood on the spectators, the space was hired out for a shew of dancing dogs. I think, without conceit, we made the very same remark on reading some of their pieces, which being written for other purposes, let us into a view of their social life. It struck us that the habits of Paris had no resem|blance to the finished virtues, or to the polished vice, and elegant, though not blameless luxury, of the capital of a great empire. Their society was more like that of a den of outlaws upon a doubt|ful frontier: of a lewd tavern for the revels and debauches of banditti, assassins, braves, smugglers, and their more desperate paramours, mixed with bombastick players, the refuse and rejected offal of strolling theatres, puffing out ill-sorted verses about virtue, mixed with the licentious and blas|phemous songs, proper to their brutal and hard|ened course of life. This system of manners in itself is at war with all orderly and moral society, and is in it's neighbourhood unsafe. If great bo|dies of that kind were any where established in a bordering territory, we should have a right to de|mand of their Governments the suppression of such a nuisance. What are we to do if the Go|vernment and the whole community is of the same description?</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="53">
The operation of dangerous and delusive first principles obliges us to have recourse to the true ones. In the intercourse between nations, we are apt to rely too much on the instrumental part. We lay too much weight upon the formality of treaties and compacts. We do not act much more wisely when we trust to the interest of men as guarantees of their engagements. The interests frequently tear to pieces the engagements; and the passions trample upon both. Entirely to trust to either is to disregard our own safety, or not to know mankind. Men are not tied to one an|other by papers and seals. They are led to asso|ciate by resemblances, by conformities, by sym|pathies. It is with nations as with individuals. Nothing is so strong a tie of amity between na|tion and nation as correspondence in laws, customs, manners, and habits of life. They have more than the force of treaties in themselves. They are obli|gations written in the heart. They approximate men to men, without their knowledge, and some|times against their intentions. The secret, unseen, but irrefragable bond of habitual intercourse, helds them together, even when their perverse and liti|gious nature sets them to equivocate, souffle, and fight about the terms of their written obligations.</P>
<P>As to war, if it be the means of wrong and vio|lence, it is the sole means of justice amongst nations.

Nothing can banish it from the world. They who say otherwise, intending to impose upon us, do not impose upon themselves. But it is one of the greatest objects of human wisdom to mitigate those evils which we cannot remove. The conformity and analogy of which I speak, incapable, like every thing else, of preserving perfect trust and tranquillity among men, has a strong tendency to facilitate accommodation, and to produce a ge|nerous oblivion of the rancour of their quarrels. With this similitude, peace is more of peace, and war is less of war. I will go further. There have been periods of time in which communities, appa|rently in peace with each other, have been more perfectly separated than, in later times, many na|tions in Europe have been in the course of long and bloody wars. The cause must be sought in the similitude in Europe of religion, laws, and manners. At bottom, these are all the same. The writers on public law have often called this <HI>aggre|gate</HI> of nations a Commonwealth. They had rea|son. It is virtually one great state having the same basis of general law; with some diversity of pro|vincial customs and local establishments. The na|tions of Europe have had the very same Christian religion, agreeing in the fundamental parts, vary|ing a little in the ceremonies and in the subordi|nate doctrines. The whole of the polity and oeconomy of every country in Europe have been
<PB N="49" REF="55">
derived from the &s;ame &s;ources. They were drawn from the old Germanic or Gothic cu&s;tumary; from the feudal in&s;titutions which mu&s;t be con|&s;idered as an emanation from tho&s;e cu&s;toms; and the whole has been improved and dige&s;ted into &s;y&s;tem and di&s;cipline by the Roman law. From hence aro&s;e the &s;everal orders, with or without a Monarch, which are called States in every coun|try; the &s;trong traces of which, where Monarchy predominated, were never wholly extingui&s;hed or merged in de&s;poti&s;m. In the few places where Monarchy was ca&s;t off, the &s;pirit of European Monarchy was &s;till left. Tho&s;e countries &s;till con|tinued countries of States, that is, of cla&s;&s;es, orders, and di&s;tinctions, &s;uch as had before &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, or nearly &s;o. Indeed the force and form of the in&s;ti|tution called States, continued in greater perfec|tion in tho&s;e republican countries than under Mo|narchies. From all tho&s;e &s;ources aro&s;e a &s;y&s;tem of manners and of education which was nearly &s;imilar in all countries, and which &s;oftened, blended, and harmonized the colours of the whole. There was little difference in the form of their Univer|&s;ities for the education of their youth, whether with regard to faculties, to &s;ciences, or to that erudition which is u&s;ed to impart, with liberal morals, a kind of elegance to the mind. From this re&s;emblance in the modes of intercour&s;e, and in the whole form and fa&s;hion of life, no citizen of Europe could
<PB N="50" REF="56">
be altogether an exile in any part of it. There nothing more than a plea&s;ing variety to recreate and in&s;truct the mind; to enrich the imagina|tion; and to meliorate the heart. When a man travelled or re&s;ided for health, plea&s;ure, bu&s;ine&s;s or nece&s;&s;ity, from his own country, he never felt him&s;elf quite abroad. My friend, Mr. Wyld, the late profe&s;&s;or of law in Edinburgh, a young man of infinite promi&s;e, and who&s;e lo&s;s at this time is ine&s;timable, has beautifully applied two lines of Ovid to this unity and diver&s;ity in Europe, before the cur&s;e of the French Revolution had fallen upon us all.<Q><L>&mdash;"Facies non omnibus una;</L>

<P>The whole body of this new &s;cheme of manners in &s;upport of the new &s;cheme of politicks, I con|&s;ider as a &s;trong and deci&s;ive proof of determined ambition and &s;y&s;tematick ho&s;tility. I defy the mo&s;t refining ingenuity to invent any other cau&s;e for the total departure of the Jacobin Republick from every one of the ideas and u&s;ages, religious, legal, moral, or &s;ocial, of this civilized world, and to tear her&s;elf from it's communion with &s;uch &s;tu|died violence, but from a formed re&s;olution of keeping no terms with that world. It has not been, as has been fal&s;ely and in&s;idiou&s;ly repre&s;ented, that the&s;e mi&s;creants had only broke with their old Go|vernment.
<PB N="51" REF="57">
They made a &s;chi&s;m with the whole univer&s;e, and that &s;chi&s;m extended to almo&s;t every thing great and &s;mall. For one, I wi&s;h, &s;ince it is gone thus far, that the breach had been &s;o com|pleat, as to make all intercour&s;e impracticable; but partly by accident, partly by de&s;ign, partly from the re&s;i&s;tance of the matter, enough is left to pre&s;erve intercour&s;e, whil&s;t amity is de&s;troyed or corrupted in its principle.</P>
<P>This violent breach of the community of Eu|rope, we mu&s;t conclude to have been made, (even if they had not expre&s;sly declared it over and over again) either to force mankind into an adoption of their &s;y&s;tem, or to live in perpetual enmity with a community the mo&s;t potent we have ever known. Can any per&s;on imagine, that in offering to man|kind this de&s;perate alternative, there is no indica|tion of a ho&s;tile mind, becau&s;e men are &s;uppo&s;ed to have a right to act without coercion in their own territories? As to the right of men to act any where according to their plea&s;ure, without any moral tie, no &s;uch right exi&s;ts. Men are never in a &s;tate of <HI>total</HI> independence of each other. It is not the condition of our nature; nor is it conceiv|able how any man can pur&s;ue a con&s;iderable cour&s;e of action without its having &s;ome effect upon others; or, of cour&s;e, without producing &s;ome de|gree of re&s;pon&s;ibility for his conduct. The <HI>&s;itu|ations</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="58">
in which men relatively &s;tand produce the rules and principles of that re&s;pon&s;ibility, and afford directions to prudence in exacting it.</P>
<P>Di&s;tance of place does not extingui&s;h the duties or the rights of men; but it often renders their exerci&s;e impracticable. The &s;ame circum&s;tance of di&s;tance renders the noxious effects of an evil &s;y&s;|tem in any community le&s;s pernicious. But there are &s;ituations where this difficulty does not oc|cur; and in which, therefore, the&s;e duties are obligatory, and the&s;e rights are to be a&s;&s;erted. It has ever been the method of publick juri&s;ts to draw the analogies on which they form the law of nations, from the principles of law which prevail in civil community. Civil laws are not all of them merely po&s;itive. Tho&s;e which are rather con|clu&s;ions of legal rea&s;on, than matters of &s;tatutable provi&s;ion, belong to univer&s;al equity, and are uni|ver&s;ally applicable. Almo&s;t the whole praetorian law is &s;uch. There is a <HI>Law of Neighbourhood</HI> which does not leave a man perfect ma&s;ter on his own ground. When a neighbour &s;ees a <HI>new erection,</HI> in the nature of a nui&s;ance, &s;et up at his door, he has a right to repre&s;ent it to the judge; who, on his part, has a right to order the work to be &s;taid; or if e&s;tabli&s;hed, to be removed. On this head, the parent law is expre&s;s and clear; and has made many wi&s;e provi&s;ions, which, without de&s;troying, regulate and
<PB N="53" REF="59">
re&s;train the right of <HI>owner&s;hip,</HI> by the right of <HI>vi|cinage.</HI> No <HI>innovation</HI> is permitted that may re|dound, even &s;econdarily, to the prejudice of a neighbour. The whole doctrine of that important head of pretorian law, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>De novi operis nunciatione,</HI>"</Q> is founded on the principle, that no <HI>new</HI> u&s;e &s;hould be made of a man's private liberty of operating upon his private property, from whence a detriment may be ju&s;tly apprehended by his neighbour. This law of denunciation is pro&s;pective. It is to anticipate what is called <HI>damnum infectum,</HI> or <HI>damnum nondum factum,</HI> that is a damage ju&s;tly apprehended but not actually done. Even before it is clearly known, whether the innovation be da|mageable or not, the judge is competent to i&s;&s;ue a prohibition to innovate, until the point can be de|termined. This prompt interference is grounded on principles favourable to both parties. It is pre|ventive of mi&s;cheif difficult to be repaired, and of ill blood difficult to be &s;oftened. The rule of law, therefore, which comes before the evil, is among&s;t the very be&s;t parts of equity, and ju&s;tifies the promptne&s;s of the remedy; becau&s;e, as it is well ob&s;erved, <HI>Res damni infecti celeritatem de&s;iderat, &amp; periculo&s;a e&s;t dilatio.</HI> This right of denunciation does not hold, when things continue, however in|conveniently to the neighbourhood, according to the <HI>antient</HI> mode. For there is a &s;ort of pre&s;ump|tion again&s;t novelty, drawn out of a deep con&s;ide|ration
<PB N="54" REF="60">
of human nature and human affairs; and the maxim of juri&s;prudence is well laid down, <HI>Vetu&s;tas pro lege &s;emper habetur.</HI></P>
<P>Such is the law of civil vicinity. Now where there is no con&s;tituted judge, as between indepen|dent &s;tates there is not, the vicinage it&s;elf is the natural judge. It is, preventively, the a&s;&s;ertor of it's own rights; or remedially, their avenger. Neigh|bours are pre&s;umed to take cognizance of each other's acts. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Vicini, vicinorum facta pre&s;umuntur &s;cire.</HI>"</Q> This principle, which, like the re&s;t, is as true of nations, as of men, has be&s;towed on the grand vicinage of Europe, a duty to know, and a right to prevent, any capital innovation which may amount to the erection of a dangerous nui&s;ance. Of the importance of that innovation, and the mi&s;cheif of that nui&s;ance, they are, to be &s;ure, bound to judge not litigiou&s;ly: but it is in their competence to judge. What in civil &s;ociety is a ground of action, in politic &s;ociety is a ground of war. But the exerci&s;e of that competent juri&s;dic|tion is a matter of moral prudence. As &s;uits in civil &s;ociety, &s;o war in the political, is ever a matter of great deliberation. It is not this or that particular proceeding picked out here and there, as a &s;ubject of quarrel, that will do. There mu&s;t be an aggregate of mi&s;chief. There mu&s;t be marks of deliberation; there mu&s;t be
<PB N="55" REF="61">
traces of de&s;ign. There mu&s;t be indications of malice; there mu&s;t be tokens of ambition. There mu&s;t be &s;orce in the body where they exi&s;t; there mu&s;t be energy in the mind. When all the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances combine, or the important parts of them, the duty of the vicinity calls for the exerci&s;e of it's competence; and the rules of prudence do not re&s;train, but demand it.</P>
<P>In de&s;cribing the nui&s;ance erected by &s;o pe&s;tilen|tial a manufactory, by con&s;tructing &s;o infamous a brothel, by digging a night cellar for &s;uch thieves, murderers, and hou&s;ebreakers, as never infe&s;ted the world, I am &s;o far from aggravating, that I have fallen infinitely &s;hort of the evil. No man who has attended to the particulars of what has been done in France, and combined them with the principles there a&s;&s;erted, can po&s;&s;ibly doubt it. When I compare with this great cau&s;e of nations, the trifling points of honour, the &s;till more con|temptible points of intere&s;t, the light ceremonies, the undefinable punctilios, the di&s;putes about pre|cedency, the lowering or the hoi&s;ting of a &s;ail, the dealing in a hundred or two of wild cat-&s;kins on the other &s;ide of the Globe, which have often kindled up the flames of war between nations, I &s;tand a&s;toni&s;hed at tho&s;e per&s;ons, who do not feel a re&s;entment, not more natural than politick, at the attrocious in&s;ults that this mon&s;trous com|pound
<PB N="56" REF="62">
offers to the dignity of every nation, and who are not alarmed with what it threatens to their &s;afety.</P>
<P>I have therefore been decidedly of opinion, that the vicinage of Europe had not only a right, but an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty, and an exigent intere&s;t, to de|nunciate this new work before it had produced the danger we have &s;o &s;orely felt, and which we &s;hall long feel. The example of what is done by France is too important not to have a va&s;t and exten&s;ive influence; and that example backed with it's power, mu&s;t bear with great force on tho&s;e who are near it; e&s;pecially on tho&s;e who &s;hall re|cognize the pretended Republick on the principle upon which it now &s;tands. It is not an old &s;truc|ture which you have found as it is, and are not to di&s;pute of the original end and de&s;ign with which it had been &s;o fa&s;hioned. It is a recent wrong, and can plead no pre&s;cription. It violates the rights upon which not only the community of France, but tho&s;e on which all communities are founded. The principles on which they proceed are <HI>general</HI> principles, and are as true in England as in any other country. They who recognize the authority of the&s;e Regicides and robbers upon principle, ju&s;tify their acts; and e&s;tabli&s;h them as precidents. It is a que&s;tion not between France and England. It is a que&s;tion between property and
<PB N="57" REF="63">
force. The property claims. Its claim has been allowed: but it &s;eems that we are to reject the property, and to take part with the force. The pro|perty of the nation is the nation. Tho&s;e who ma&s;|&s;acre, plunder, and expel the body of the proprie|tary, are murderers and robbers. They are no Re|publick, nor can be treated with as &s;uch. The State, in it's e&s;&s;ence, mu&s;t be moral and ju&s;t; and it may be &s;o, though a tyrant or u&s;urper may be accidentally at the head of it. This is a thing to be lamented: but this notwith&s;tanding, the body of the com|monwealth may remain in all it's integrity and be perfectly &s;ound in it's compo&s;ition. The pre&s;ent ca&s;e is different. It is not a revolution in govern|ment. It is a de&s;truction and decompo&s;ition of the whole &s;ociety, which never can be made of right, nor without terrible con&s;equences to all about it, both in the act and in the example. This pretended Republic is founded in crimes, and ex|i&s;ts by wrong and robbery; and wrong and rob|bery, far from a title to any thing, is war with mankind. To be at peace with robbery is to be an accomplice with it.</P>
<P>A body politick is not a geographical idea. They who proceed as if it were &s;uch, I tru&s;t, do not under&s;tand what they do. Locality does not con&s;titute a body politick. Had Cade and his gang got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of London, they would not have
<PB N="58" REF="64">
been the Lord-Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council. The body politick of France exi&s;ted in the maje&s;ty of it's throne; in the dignity of it's nobility; in the honour of its gentry; in the &s;anc|tity of its clergy; in the reverence of it's magi|&s;tracy; in the weight and con&s;ideration due to it's landed property, in the re&s;pect due to it's move|able &s;ub&s;tance repre&s;ented by the corporations of the kingdom in all countries. All the&s;e particular <HI>moleculae</HI> united, form the great ma&s;s of what is truly the body politick. They are &s;o many de|po&s;its and receptacles of ju&s;tice; becau&s;e they can only exi&s;t by ju&s;tice. Nation is a moral e&s;&s;ence, not a geographical arrangement, or a denomination of the nomenclator. France though out of her territorial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, exi&s;ts; becau&s;e the &s;ole po&s;&s;ible claimant, I mean the proprietary, and the government to which the proprietary adheres, exi&s;ts and claims. God forbid, that if you were expelled from your hou&s;e by ruffians and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, that I &s;hould call the material walls, doors and windows of &mdash;, the ancient and honour|able family of &mdash;.

Would this be the England that I, and even &s;trangers, admired, honoured, loved, and cheri&s;hed? Would not the exiles of England alone be my Government and my fellow citizens? Would not their places of refuge be my temporary country? Would not all my duties and all my affections be there and there only? Should I con&s;ider my&s;elf as a traitor to my country, and de&s;erving of death, if I knocked at the door and heart of every Potentate in Chri&s;tendom to &s;uccour my friends, and to avenge them on their enemies? Could I, in any way, &s;hew my&s;elf more a patriot? What &s;hould I think of tho&s;e Potentates who in&s;ulted their &s;uffer|ing brethren; who treated them as vagrants, and could find no allies, no friends, but in Regicide murderers and robbers? What ought I to think and feel, if being geographers in&s;tead of Kings, they recognized the de&s;olated cities, the wa&s;ted fields, and the rivers polluted with blood, of this geometrical mea&s;urement, as the honourable
<PB N="61" REF="67">
member of Europe, called England? In that condi|tion, what &s;hould we think of Sweden, Denmark, or Holland, or whatever power afforded us a churli&s;h and treacherous ho&s;pitality, if they &s;hould invite us to join the &s;tandard of our King, our Laws, and our Religion, if they &s;hould give us a direct promi&s;e of protection,&mdash;if after all this, taking ad|vantage of our deplorable &s;ituation, which left us no choice, they were to treat us as the lowe&s;t and vile&s;t of all mercenaries? If they were to &s;end us far from the aid of our King, and our &s;uffering Country, to &s;quander us away in the mo&s;t pe&s;tilen|tial climates, for a venal enlargement of their own territories, for the purpo&s;e of trucking them when obtained with our murderers? If in that mi&s;erable &s;ervice we were not to be con&s;idered either as Engli&s;h, or as Swedes, or Dutch, or Danes, but as outca&s;ts of the human race? Whil&s;t we were fight|ing tho&s;e battles of their intere&s;t, and as their &s;ol|diers, how &s;hould we feel if we were to be ex|cluded from all their cartels? How mu&s;t we feel, if the pride and flower of the Engli&s;h Nobility and Gentry, who might e&s;cape the pe&s;tilential clime, and the devouring &s;word, &s;hould, if taken pri|&s;oners, be delivered over as rebel &s;ubjects, to be condemned as rebels, as traitors, as the vile&s;t of all criminals, by tribunals formed of Maroon ne|groe &s;laves, covered over with the blood of their ma&s;ters, who were made free, and organi&s;ed into

judges, for their robberies and murders? What &s;hould we feel under this inhuman, in&s;ulting, and barbarous protection of Swedes and Hollanders? Should we not obte&s;t Heaven, and whatever ju&s;tice there is yet on earth? Oppre&s;&s;ion makes wi&s;e men mad; but the di&s;temper is &s;till the madne&s;s of the wi&s;e, which is better than the &s;obriety of fools. Her cry is the voice of &s;acred mi&s;ery, exalted, not into wild raving, but into the &s;anctified phren&s;y of in&s;piration and prophecy&mdash;in that bitterne&s;s of &s;oul, in that indignation of &s;uffering virtue, in that exaltation of de&s;pair, would not per&s;ecuted Engli&s;h Loyalty cry out, with an awful warning voice, and denounce the de&s;truction that waits on Monarchs, who con&s;ider fidelity to them as the mo&s;t degrading of all vices; who &s;uffer it to be puni&s;hed as the mo&s;t abominable of all crimes; and who have no re&s;pect but for rebels traitors, Regicides, and furious negro &s;laves, who&s;e crimes have broke their chains? Would not this warm language of high indignation have more of &s;ound rea&s;on in it, more of real affection, more of true attachment, than all the lullabies of flatterers, who would hu&s;h Monarchs to &s;leep in the arms of death? Let them be well convinced, that if ever this ex|ample &s;hould prevail in its whole extent, it will have its full operation. Whil&s;t Kings &s;tand firm on their ba&s;e, though under that ba&s;e there is a &s;ure|wrought mine, their levees will never want to
<PB N="63" REF="69">
&s;well them a &s;ingle per&s;on of tho&s;e who are attach|ed to their fortune, and not to their per&s;ons or cau&s;e. Hereafter none will &s;upport a tottering throne. Some will fly, for fear of being cru&s;hed under the ruin; &s;ome will join in making it. They will &s;eek in the pre&s;ervation of Royalty, fame, and power, and wealth, and the homage of Kings&mdash;with <HI>Reubel,</HI> with <HI>Carnot,</HI> and <HI>Rovelliere,</HI> rather than &s;uffer exile and beggary with the Cond&eacute;s, or the Broglios, the Ca&s;tries, the D'Avrais, the Ser|rents, the Cazal&eacute;s, and the long line of loyal &s;uf|fering Patriot Nobles, or to be butchered with the victims of the laws, the De Sezes, the d'E&s;preme|monils, and the Mal&s;herbes.</P>
<P>The&s;e examples are the &s;chool of mankind, and they will learn at no other. This war, therefore, is not a war for Louis the Eighteenth, or for the property, virtue, fidelity of France; but for George the Third, Francis the Second, and for all the property, honour, virtue and religion of England, of Germany, and all nations.</P>
<P>But, &s;ay &s;ome, you force opinion. You can never extirpate opinion without extirpating a whole nation. Nay, by pur&s;uing it, you only increa&s;e its partizans. Opinions are things out of human juri&s;diction. I have formerly heard this from the mouths of great men, with more &s;urprize than
<PB N="64" REF="70">
&s;atisfaction. They alledged as a proof of their doctrine, the wars of Charles the Fifth, and &s;ome of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, again&s;t the Reformation.</P>
<P>It is &s;o common, though &s;o unrea&s;onable, it is hardly worth remarking, that no per&s;ons pur&s;ue more fiercely with criminal proce&s;s, and with every kind of coercion, the publication of opinions con|trary to their own, than tho&s;e do, who claim in this re&s;pect the mo&s;t unbounded latitude to them|&s;elves. If it were not for this incon&s;i&s;tency, then war again&s;t opinions might be ju&s;tified as all others, more or le&s;s, according to the rea&s;on of the ca&s;e: for the ca&s;e judged on by moral prudence, and not by any univer&s;al ab&s;tract principle of right, is to guide government in this delicate point.</P>
<P>As to the mere matter of extirpation of all kinds of opinions, whether right or wrong, without the extirpation of a people, it is a thing &s;o very com|mon, that would be clouded and ob&s;cured rather than illu&s;trated by examples. Every revolution in the predominant opinion made by the force of do|me&s;tic legal government, by the force of any u&s;ur|pation, by the force of any conque&s;t, is a proof to the contrary;&mdash;and there is no nation which has not experienced tho&s;e changes. In&s;tances enough may be furni&s;hed of people who have enthu&s;ia&s;ti|cally, and with force, propagated tho&s;e opinions,
<PB N="65" REF="71">
which &s;ome time before they re&s;i&s;ted with their blood. Rarely have ever great changes in opinion taken place without the application of force, more or le&s;s: Like every thing el&s;e in human life and human affairs, it is not univer&s;ally true, that a per&s;ecution of opinions le&s;&s;ens or increa&s;es the number of their votaries. In finding where it may or may not have gathered the&s;e effects, the &s;agacity of Government &s;hines or is di&s;graced, as well as in the time, the manner, the choice of the opinions on which it ought to u&s;e or forbear the &s;word of dome&s;tick or of foreign ju&s;tice. But it is a fal&s;e maxim, that opinions ought to be indifferent to us, either as men or as a State. Opinion is the rudder of human action; and as the opinion is wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, vicious or moral, the cau&s;e of action is noxious or &s;alutary. It has even been the great pri|mary object of &s;peculative and doctrinal philo&s;ophy to regulate opinion. It is the great object of po|litical philo&s;ophy to promote that which is &s;ound; and to extirpate what is mi&s;chievous, and which directly tends to render men bad citizens in the community, and mi&s;chievous neighbours out of it. Opinions are of infinite con&s;equence. They make the manners&mdash;in fact, they make the laws: they make the Lagi&s;lator. They are, therefore, of all things, tho&s;e to which provident Government ought to look mo&s;t to in their beginnings. After a time they may look to them in vain. When,
<PB N="66" REF="72">
therefore, I am told that a war is a war of opinions, I am told that it is the mo&s;t important of all wars.</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t not be told that this would lead to eternal war and per&s;ecution. It would certainly, if we argued like metaphy&s;icians run mad, who do not correct prudence, the queen of virtues, to be any virtue at all,&mdash;and would either throw the bridle on the neck of headlong Nature, or tie it up for ever to the po&s;t. No &s;ophi&s;try&mdash;no chicane here. Government is not to refine men out of in|nocent and moral liberty by forced inferences, drawn by a torturing logic; or to &s;uffer them to go down hill the highway that leads directly to every crime and every vice.</P>
<P>Without entering much into the compari&s;on of the two ca&s;es, (that of this war and that of Charles the Fifth again&s;t the reformation) which holds very ill, I &s;hall only beg leave to remark, that theological opinions as &s;uch, whether &s;ound or er|roneous, do not go directly to the well being of &s;ocial, of civil, or of politick &s;ociety. But as long as opinion is the very ground and pillar of Government, and the main &s;pring of human ac|tion, there are opinions which directly affect the&s;e very things. An opinion, that it is a man's duty to take from me my goods, and to kill me if I re&s;i&s;t him. An opinion that he has a right, at his will,
<PB N="67" REF="73">
to pull down the Government by which I am pro|tected in that life and property, and to place it in the hands of the enemies of both. The&s;e it is very ex|traordinary to hear compared to the theological dog|mas concerning grace and ju&s;tification&mdash;and the nature and e&s;&s;ence of the &s;acrament and other pious opinions on the one &s;ide or on the other&mdash;which left human &s;ociety altogether, or nearly, as it was. They did not preach vices or crimes. The parties di&s;puted on the be&s;t means of promoting virtue, religion and morals. Whether any collateral points relative to the&s;e que&s;tions or other circum&s;tances of a more political nature mingled with them, might or might not ju&s;tify a war, is a matter of hi&s;torical critici&s;m, with which, at this day, we are little con|cerned. But in the ca&s;e before us, I mu&s;t declare, that the doctrine and di&s;cipline of this &s;ect is one of the mo&s;t alarming circum&s;tances relating to it, and the attempt to compare them with the opinions of &s;chool theologicians, is a thing in it&s;elf highly alarm|ing. I know that when men po&s;&s;e&s;s the be&s;t princi|ples, the pa&s;&s;ions lead them to act in oppo&s;ition to them. But when the moral principles are formed &s;y&s;tematically to play into the hand of the pa&s;&s;ions; when that which is to correct vice and to re&s;train violence, is by an infernal doctrine, daringly avow|ed, carefully propagated, enthu&s;ia&s;tically held, and practically followed, I &s;hall think my&s;elf treated like a child, when I hear this compared to a controver&s;y
<PB N="68" REF="74">
in the &s;chools. When I &s;ee a great country, with all its re&s;ources, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by this &s;ect, and turned to its purpo&s;es, I mu&s;t be wor&s;e than a child to con|ceive it a thing indifferent to me. When this great country is &s;o near me, and otherwi&s;e &s;o &s;ituated, that except through its territory, I can hardly have a communication with any other, the &s;tate of moral and political opinion, and moral and political di&s;ci|pline in that country, becomes of &s;till greater im|portance to me. When robbers, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and rebels, are not only debauched, but endoctrinated regularly, by a cour&s;e of inverted education, into murder, in|&s;urrection, and the violation of all property, I hold, that this, in&s;tead of excu&s;ing, or palliating their offences, in&s;pires a peculiar venom into every evil act they do; and that all &s;uch univer&s;ities of crimes, and all &s;uch profe&s;&s;ors of robbery, are in a perpetual &s;tate of ho&s;tility with mankind.</P>
<P>Let me now &s;ay a word upon another topic, and on the ca&s;e put to illu&s;trate it, that is, on the indif|ference with which we ought to regard the plan of Government, and the &s;cheme of morals that pre|vail in a State, in any que&s;tion of peace and war with it. In &s;upport of this doctrine, they cite the ca&s;e of Algiers as a &s;trong one&mdash;with an hint, that is the &s;tronger ca&s;e. I &s;hould take no notice of this &s;ort of inducement, if I had found it only where fir&s;t it was. I do not want re&s;pect for tho&s;e from
<PB N="69" REF="75">
whom I fir&s;t heard it&mdash;but having no controver&s;y at pre&s;ent with them, I only think it not ami&s;s to re&s;t on it a little, as I find it adopted with much more of the &s;ame kind, by &s;everal of tho&s;e on whom &s;uch rea&s;oning before made no apparent impre&s;&s;ion. I was however mi&s;taken; they were not rejected, but only &s;tored and laid by for an occa&s;ion&mdash;<HI>condo et compono quae mox depromere po&s;&s;im.</HI> If it had no force to prevent us from &s;ubmitting to this nece&s;&s;ary war, it furni&s;hes no better ground for our making an un|nece&s;&s;ary and ruinous peace To this Algerian parallel, however, I have to &s;ay, that arguments of analogy in law are of great weight. Of cour&s;e, in a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the ju&s;tice of the war I attend to them, provided they are analogies of principle, and not of mere practice. But when they are only ar|guments of analogy <HI>ad hominem,</HI> they only &s;erve to confute and &s;ilence an adver&s;ary, who has acted in &s;uch a manner, and on &s;uch principles; but to a per&s;on who doubts the propriety of the action and the motive which is made the ground of the analo|gy, it can neither &s;hame or perplex him. This analogical argument would lead us a good way. The fact is, we our&s;elves, with a little corn, others more directly, pay a <HI>tribute</HI> to the Republick of Al|giers. Is it meant to reconcile us to the payment of a <HI>tribute</HI> to the French Republick? That this, with other things more ruinous, will be demanded hereafter, I little doubt; but for the pre&s;ent, this
<PB N="70" REF="76">
will not be avowed&mdash;though our minds are to be gradually prepared for it.</P>
<P>In truth the arguments from this ca&s;e is worth little even to tho&s;e who approve the buying an Algerine forbearance of piracy. There are many things which men do not approve, that they mu&s;t do to avoid a greater evil. To argue from thence, that they are to act in the &s;ame manner in all ca&s;es, is turning nece&s;&s;ity into a law. Upon what is mat|ter of prudence, the argument concludes the con|trary way. Becau&s;e we have done one humiliat|ing act, we ought, with infmite caution, to admit more acts of the &s;ame nature, le&s;t humiliation &s;hould become our habitual &s;tate. Matters of pru|dence are under the dominion of circum&s;tances, and not of logical analogies. It is &s;o ab&s;urd to take it otherwi&s;e. In the mouths of the weak and igno|rant, it makes me laugh; in the mouths of men of learning and talents, it makes me &s;ick. I, for one do more than doubt the policy of this kind of con|vention with Algiers.</P>
<P>On tho&s;e who think as I do, the argument can make no &s;ort of impre&s;&s;ion. I know &s;omething of the Con&s;titution and compo&s;ition of this very extra|ordinary Republick. It has a Con&s;titution, I admit, &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent tumultuous military tyranny of France, by which an handful of ob&s;cure ru&s;&s;ians,
<PB N="71" REF="77">
domineer over a fertile country, and a brave people. For the compo&s;ition, too, I admit, the Algerine community re&s;embles that of France; being the very &s;cum, &s;candal, di&s;grace, and pe&s;t of the Turk|i&s;h A&s;ia. The grand Seignior, to di&s;burthen the country, &s;uffers the Dey to recruit, in his do|nions, the corps of Jani&s;&s;aries, or A&s;aphs which form the Directory, or Council of Elders of the African Republick, one and indvi&s;ible. But notwith&s;tanding this re&s;emblance, which I allow, I never &s;hall &s;o far injure the Jani&s;arian Repub|lick of Algiers, as to put it in compari&s;on for every &s;ort of crime, turpitude, and oppre&s;&s;ion with the Jacobin Republick of Paris. There is no que&s;tion with me to which of the two I &s;hould choo&s;e to be a neighbour or a &s;ubject. But &s;ituated as I am, I am in no danger of becoming to Algiers either the one or the other. It is not &s;o in my relation to the athei&s;tical fanaticks of France. Have the Gentle|men who borrowed this happy parallel, no idea of the different conduct to be held with re|gard to the very &s;ame evil at an immen&s;e di&s;|tance, and when it is at your door? when its power is enormous, as when it is comparatively as feeble as its di&s;tance is remote? and when there is a bar|rier of language and u&s;ages, which prevents your being corrupted through certain old corre&s;pon|dences and habitudes, which cannot for a long time be &s;o wholly taken away, as not to make many
<PB N="72" REF="78">
of your people &s;u&s;ceptible of contagion from hor|rible novelties that are introduced into every thing el&s;e? I can contemplate, without horror, a royal or a national tyger on the borders of Pegu. I can look at him, with an ea&s;y curio&s;ity, as pri|&s;oner within bars in the menagerie of the Tower. But if, by Habeas Corpus, or otherwi&s;e, he was to come into the Lobby of the Hou&s;e of Commons, whil&s;t your door was open, any of you would be more &s;tout than wi&s;e, who would not gladly make his e&s;cape out of the back windows. This Amba&s;&s;a|dor from Bengal, would di&s;per&s;e you &s;ooner than a di&s;&s;olution by Royal Prerogative. I certainly &s;hould dread more from a wild cat in my bed|chamber, than from all the lions that roar in the de&s;erts behind Algiers. But in this parallel it is the cat that is at a di&s;tance, and the lions and ty|gers that are in our anti-chambers and our lobbies. Algiers is not near; Algiers is not powerful; Al|giers is not our neighbour; Algiers is not infec|tious. Algiers, whatever it may be, is not an old creation; and we have good data to calculate all the mi&s;chief to be expected from it. When I find Algiers transferred to Calais, I will tell you what I think of that point. In the mean time, the ca&s;e quoted from the Algerine reports, will not apply as authority. We &s;hall put it out of court; and &s;o far as that goes, let the council for the Jacobin peace take nothing by their motion.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="79">
When we voted as we did, we were providing for dangers that were direct, home, pre&s;&s;ing, and not remote, contingent, uncertain, and formed upon loo&s;e analogies. The whole tenor of con|duct of France, not one or two doubtful or de|tached acts or expre&s;&s;ions. To us it appeared, that the whole body of its di&s;cipline, compre|hending the form of the State, and the &s;cheme of opinion and manners, were adopted both as means and ends; as means, to e&s;tabli&s;h univer&s;al empire; and as ends to fix the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem in every place to which their empire or their influence could extend. It was again&s;t this &s;y&s;tem that you and I voted for war. It is with this &s;y&s;tem that I &s;hall for ever de|precate a relation of peace and amity.</P>
<P>Various per&s;ons may concur in the &s;ame mea|&s;ure on various grounds. They may be various, without being contrary to, or exclu&s;ive of, each other. I thought the in&s;olent unprovoked ag|gre&s;&s;ion of the Regicide upon our Ally of Hol|land a good ground of war; I think his manife&s;t attempt to overturn the balance of Europe a good ground of war; as a good ground of war I con&s;ider his declaration of war on his Maje&s;ty and his kingdom. But though I have taken all the&s;e to my aid, I con&s;ider them as nothing more than as a &s;ort of evidence to indicate the trea&s;onable mind within. It was not for their
<PB N="74" REF="80">
former declaration of war, nor for any &s;pecific act of ho&s;tility that I primarily wi&s;hed to re&s;i&s;t them, or to per&s;evere in my re&s;i&s;tance. It was becau&s;e the faction in France had a&s;&s;umed a form, had adopted a body of principles and maxims, and had regularly and &s;y&s;tematically acted on them, by which &s;he virtually had put her&s;elf in a po&s;ture which was in it&s;elf a declaration of war again&s;t mankind.</P>
<P>It is fit that the people &s;hould know when the que&s;tion is concerning peace and amity, the true nature, habits, di&s;po&s;itions, and views of the party with whom they are to cultivate friend&s;hip. It is of le&s;s importance to you, what is the character of your enemy, than what are the habits and di&s;po|&s;itions of your friend. The relation of enemy to enemy is &s;imple. Enemies aim by force at each other's de&s;truction. They are always, there|fore, in a &s;tate of defiance and di&s;tru&s;t; but the character of a friend is a &s;erious matter. With a friend, the very nature of the relation mu&s;t take off the guard. The people of England have felt their enemies, it is fit that they &s;hould know their friends.</P>
<P>Before our opinions are quoted again&s;t our&s;elves, it is proper that, from our &s;erious deliberation they may be worth quoting. It is without rea&s;on we
<PB N="75" REF="81">
prai&s;e the wi&s;dom of our con&s;titution, in putting un|der the di&s;cretion of the Crown, the aweful tru&s;t of war and peace, if the Mini&s;ters of the Crown virtually return it again into our hands. It was placed there as a &s;acred depo&s;it, to &s;ecure us again&s;t popular ra&s;hne&s;s in plunging into wars, and again&s;t the effects of popular di&s;may, di&s;gu&s;t, or lu&s;&s;itude in getting out of them as imprudently as we might fir&s;t engage in them. To have no other mea&s;ure in judging of tho&s;e great objects than our momen|tary opinions and de&s;ires, is to throw us back upon that very democracy which, in this part, our con|&s;titution was formed to avoid.</P>
<P>It is no excu&s;e at all for a mini&s;ter, who at our de&s;ire, takes a mea&s;ure contrary to our &s;afety, that it is our own act. He who does not &s;tay the hand of a &s;uicide is guilty of murder. To be in&s;truct|ed, is not to be degraded or en&s;laved. Information is an advantage to us, and we have a right to demand it. He that is bound to act in the dark cannot be &s;aid to act freely. When it appears evi|dent to our governors, that our de&s;ires and our in|tere&s;ts are at variance, they ought not to gratify the former at the expence of the latter. State&s;men are placed on an eminence, that they may have a larger horizon than we can po&s;&s;ibly command. They have a whole before them, which we can contemplate only in the parts, and without the
<PB N="76" REF="82">
relations. Mini&s;ters are not only our natural rulers, but our natural guides. Rea&s;on clearly and man|fully delivered, has in it&s;elf a mighty force: but rea&s;on in the mouth of legal authority, is, I may fairly &s;ay, irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>I admit that rea&s;on of &s;tate will not, in many cir|cum&s;tances permit the di&s;clo&s;ure of the true ground of a public proceeding. In that ca&s;e &s;ilence is manly and it is wi&s;e. It is fair to call for tru&s;t when the principle of rea&s;on it&s;elf &s;u&s;pends its public u&s;e. I take the di&s;tinction to be this. The ground of a particular mea&s;ure, making a part of a plan, it is rarely proper to divulge. All the broader grounds of policy on which the general plan is to be adopted, ought as rarely to be con|cealed. They who have not the whole cau&s;e be|fore them, call them politicians, call them people, call them what you will, are no judges. The diffi|culties of the ca&s;e as well as its fair &s;ide, ought to be pre&s;ented. This ought to be done: and it is all that can be done. When we have our true &s;i|tuation di&s;tinctly pre&s;ented to us, if we re&s;olve with a blind and headlong violence, to re&s;i&s;t the admonitions of our friends, and to ca&s;t our&s;elves into the hands of our potent and irreconcileable foes, then, and not till then, the mini&s;ters &s;tand acquitted before God and man, for whatever may come.</P>

Lamenting as I do, that the matter has not had &s;o full and free a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as it requires, I mean to omit none of the points which &s;eem to me nece&s;&s;ary for con&s;ideration, previous to an ar|rangement which is for ever to decide the form and the fate of Europe, In the cour&s;e, there|fore, of what I &s;hall have the honour to addre&s;s to you, I propo&s;e the following que&s;tions to your &s;e|rious thoughts. 1. Whether the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, which &s;tands for a Government in France, be &s;uch as in peace and war affects the neighbouring States in a manner different from the internal Govern|ment that formerly prevailed in that country? 2. Whether that &s;y&s;tem, &s;uppo&s;ing it's views ho&s;|tile to other nations, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es any means of being hurtful to them peculiar to it&s;elf? 3. Whether there has been lately &s;uch a change in France, as to alter the nature of it's &s;y&s;tem or it's effect upon other Powers? 4. Whether any public de|clarations or engagements exi&s;t, on the part of the allied Powers, which &s;tand in the way of a treaty of peace, which &s;uppo&s;es the right and confirms the power of the Regicide faction in France? 5. What the &s;tate of the other Powers of Europe will be with re&s;pect to each other, and their colonies, on the conclu&s;ion of a Regicide Peace? 6. Whe|ther we are driven to the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of making that kind of peace?</P>

The&s;e heads of enquiry will enable us to make the application of the &s;everal matters of fact and topics of argument, that occur in this va&s;t di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, to certain fixed principles. I do not mean to confine my&s;elf to the order in which they &s;tand. I &s;hall di&s;cu&s;s them in &s;uch a manner as &s;hall appear to me the be&s;t adapted for &s;hewing their mutual bearings and relations. Here then I clo&s;e the public matter of my Letter; but before I have done, let me &s;ay one word in apology for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In wi&s;hing this nominal peace not to be precipi|tated, I am &s;ure no man living is le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to blame the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try than I am. Some of my olde&s;t friends, (and I wi&s;h I could &s;ay it of more of them,) make a part in that Mini&s;try. There are &s;ome indeed, <Q REND="inline">"whom my dim eyes in vain explore."</Q> In my mind, a greater calamity could not have fallen on the publick than their exclu&s;ion. But I drive away that, with other melancholy thoughts. As to the di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons to whom my friends who remain, are joined, if benefits, nobly and generou&s;ly conferred, ought to procure good wi&s;hes, they are entitled to my be&s;t vows; and they have them all. They have admini&s;tered to me the only con&s;olation I am capable of receiving, which is to know that no individual will &s;uffer by my
<PB N="79" REF="85">
thirty years &s;ervice to the public. If things &s;hould give us the comparative happine&s;s of a &s;truggle, I &s;hall be found, I was going to &s;ay, fighting, (that would be fooli&s;h) but dying by the &s;ide of Mr. Pitt. I mu&s;t add, that if any thing defen&s;ive in our do|me&s;tic &s;y&s;tem can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ave us from the di&s;&s;a&s;|ters of a Regicide peace, he is the man to &s;ave us. If the finances in &s;uch a ca&s;e can be repaired, he is the man to repair them. If I &s;hould lament any of his acts, it is only when they appear to me to have no re&s;emblance to acts of his. But let him not have a confidence in him&s;elf, which no human abilities can warrant. His abilities are fully equal (and that is to &s;ay much for any man) to tho&s;e that are oppo&s;ed to him. But if we look to him as our &s;ecurity again&s;t the con&s;equences of a Regicide Peace, let us be a&s;&s;ured, that a Re|gicide Peace and a Con&s;titutional Mini&s;try are terms that will not agree. With a Regicide Peace the King cannot long have a Mini&s;ter to &s;erve him, nor the Mini&s;ter a King to &s;erve. If the Great Di&s;po&s;er, in reward of the royal and the private virtues of our Sovereign, &s;hould call him from the calamitous &s;pectacles, which will attend a &s;tate of amity with Regicide, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or will &s;urely &s;ee them, unle&s;s the &s;ame Providence greatly antici|pates the cour&s;e of nature. Thinking thus, (and not as I conceive on light grounds) I dare not flatter the reigning &s;overeign, nor any Mini&s;ter he
<PB N="80" REF="86">
has or can have, nor his Succe&s;&s;or Apparent, nor any of tho&s;e who may be called to &s;erve him, with what appears to me a fal&s;e &s;tate of their &s;ituation. We cannot have them and that Peace together.</P>
<P>I do not forget that there had been a con&s;ider|able difference between me and the great man at the head of Mini&s;try in an early &s;tage of the&s;e di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions. Under this circum&s;tance, his &s;econding his Maje&s;ty's genero&s;ity to me &s;hines with the brighter lu&s;tre. But I am &s;ure there was a period in which we agreed better in the danger of a Jacobin exi&s;tence in France. At one time, he and all Europe &s;eemed to feel it. But why am not I converted with &s;o many great Powers, and &s;o many great Mini&s;ters? It is becau&s;e I am old and &s;low.&mdash;I am in this year, 1796, only where all the powers of Europe were in 1792. I cannot move with this proce&s;&s;ion of the Equinoxes, which is preparing for us the return of &s;ome very old, I am afraid no golden aera, or the commencement of &s;ome new aera that mu&s;t be denominated from &s;ome new metal. In this cri&s;is I mu&s;t hold my tongue, or I mu&s;t &s;peak with freedom. For the few days I have to linger here, I am removed from the bu&s;y &s;cene of the world; and not more in fact than in di&s;po&s;ition, retired from all it's affairs, and all its plea&s;ures. But I hold my&s;elf to be &s;till re&s;pon&s;ible for every thing I have done in the Hou&s;e, and in the World.

<HEAD>LETTER II. On the Genius and Character of the French Revolution as it regards other Nations.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Clo&s;ed my fir&s;t Letter with &s;erious matter; and I hope it has employed your thoughts. The &s;y&s;tem of peace mu&s;t have a reference to the &s;y&s;tem of the war. On that ground, I mu&s;t therefore again recal your mind to our original opinions, which time and events have not taught me to vary.</P>
<P>My ideas and my principles led me, in this conte&s;t, to encounter France, not as a State, but as a Faction. The va&s;t territorial extent of that country, it's immen&s;e population, it's riches of production, it's riches of commerce and con|vention&mdash;the whole aggregate ma&s;s of what, in ordinary ca&s;es, con&s;titutes the force of a State, to me were but objects of &s;econdary con&s;idera|tion. They might be balanced; and they have
<PB N="84" REF="89">
been often more than balanced. Great as the&s;e things are, they are not what make the faction formidable. It is the faction that makes them truly dreadful. That faction is the evil &s;pirit that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the body of France; that informs it as a &s;oul; that &s;tamps upon its ambition, and upon all its pur&s;uits, a characteri&s;tick mark, which &s;trongly di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the &s;ame general pa&s;&s;ions, and the &s;ame general views, in other men and in other communities. It is that &s;pirit which in&s;pires into them, a new, a perni|cious, a de&s;olating activity. Con&s;tituted as France was ten years ago, it was not in that France to &s;hake, to &s;hatter, and to over|whelm Europe in the manner that we behold. A &s;ure de&s;truction impends over tho&s;e infatuated Princes, who, in the conflict with this new and overheard-of power, proceeds as if they were en|gaged in a war that bore a re&s;emblance to their former conte&s;ts; or that they can make peace in the &s;pirit of their former arrangements of paci|fication. Here the beaten path is the very rever&s;e of the &s;afe road.</P>
<P>As to me, I was always &s;teadily of opi|nion, that this di&s;order was not in its nature intermittent. I conceived that the conte&s;t once begun, could not be laid down again, to be re&s;umed at our di&s;cretion; but that our
<PB N="85" REF="90">
fir&s;t &s;truggle with this evil would al&s;o be our la&s;t. I never thought we could make peace with this &s;y&s;tem; becau&s;e it was not for the &s;ake of an object we pur&s;ued in rivalry with each other, but with the &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf that we were at war. As I under&s;tood the matter, we were at war not with it's conduct, but with it's exi&s;t|ence; convinced that it's exi&s;tence and it's ho&s;|tility were the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The faction is not local or territorial. It is a general evil. Where it lea&s;t appears in action, it is &s;till full of life. In it's &s;leep it recruits it's &s;trength, and prepares it's exertion. It's &s;pirit lies deep in the corruptions of our common nature. The &s;ocial order which re&s;trains it, feeds it. It exi&s;ts in every country in Europe; and among all orders of men in every country, who look up to France as to a common head. The centre is there. The circumference is the world of Eu|rope, wherever the race of Europe may be &s;et|tled. Every where el&s;e the faction is militant; in France it is triumphant. In France is the bank of depo&s;it, and the bank of circulation, of all the pernicious principles that are forming in every State. It will be a folly &s;carcely de&s;erving of pity, and too mi&s;chievous for contempt, to think of re&s;training it in any other country whil&s;t it is predominant there. War, in&s;tead of
<PB N="86" REF="91">
being the cau&s;e of it's force, has &s;u&s;pended it's operation. It has given a reprieve, at lea&s;t, to the Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P>The true nature of a Jacobin war, in the be|ginning, was, by mo&s;t of the Chri&s;tian Powers, felt, acknowledged, and even in the mo&s;t pre|ci&s;e manner declared. In the joint manife&s;to publi&s;hed by the Emperor and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, on the 4th of Augu&s;t, 1792, it is ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the cleare&s;t terms, and on principles which could not fail, if they had adhered to them, of cla&s;&s;ing tho&s;e monarchs with the fir&s;t benefactors of mankind. This manife&s;to was publi&s;hed, as they them&s;elves expre&s;s it, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to lay open to the pre&s;ent generation, as well as to po&s;terity, their motives, their intentions, and the <HI>di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s</HI> of their per&s;onal views; taking up arms for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving &s;ocial and political order among&s;t all civilized nations, and to &s;ecure to <HI>each</HI> &s;tate it's reli|gion, happine&s;s, independence, territories, and real con&s;titution."&mdash;"On this ground, they hoped that all Empires, and all States, ought to be unanimous; and becoming the firm guardians of the happine&s;s of mankind, they cannot &s;ail to unite their efforts to re&s;cue a numerous nation from it's own fury, to pre|&s;erve Europe from the return of barbari&s;m,
<PB N="87" REF="92">
and the Univer&s;e from the &s;ubver&s;ion and anarchy with which it was threatened."</Q> The whole of that noble performance ought to be read at the fir&s;t meeting of any Congre&s;s, which a&s;&s;emble for the purpo&s;e of pacification. In that piece <Q REND="inline">"the&s;e Powers expre&s;sly renounce all views of per&s;onal aggrandizement,"</Q> and confine them&s;elves to objects worthy of &s;o generous, &s;o heroic, and &s;o perfectly wi&s;e and politick an en|terpri&s;e. It was to the principles of this confe|deration and to no other, that we wi&s;hed our Sovereign and our Country to accede, as a part of the commonwealth of Europe.</P>
<P>As long as the&s;e powers flattered them&s;elves that the means of force would produce the ef|fect of force, they acted on tho&s;e declarations: but when their menances failed of &s;ucce&s;s, their efforts took a new direction. It did not appear to them that virtue and heroi&s;m ought to be pur|cha&s;ed by millions of rix-dollars. It is a dreadful truth, but it is a truth that cannot be concealed. In ability, in dexterity, in the di&s;tinctne&s;s of their views, the Jacobins are our &s;uperiours. They &s;aw the thing right from the very beginning. What|ever were the fir&s;t motives to the war among politicians, they &s;aw that it is in it's &s;pirit, and for it's objects, a <HI>civil war;</HI> and as &s;uch they pur&s;ued it. It is a war between the partizans
<PB N="88" REF="93">
of the antient, civil, moral, and political order of Europe again&s;t a &s;ect of fanatical and ambi|tious athei&s;ts which mean to change them all. It is not France extending a foreign empire over other nations: it is a &s;ect aiming at univer&s;al empire, and beginning with the conque&s;t of France. The leaders of that &s;ect &s;ecured the <HI>centre of Europe;</HI> and that &s;ecured, they knew, that whatever might be the event of battles and &s;ieges, their <HI>cau&s;e</HI> was victorious. Whether it's territory had a little more or a little le&s;s peeled from it's &s;urface, or whether an i&s;land or two was detached from it's commerce, to them was of little moment. The conque&s;t of France was a glorious acqui&s;ition. That once well laid as a ba&s;is of empire, opportunities never could be wanting to regain or to replace what had been lo&s;t, and dreadfully to avenge them&s;elves on the faction of their adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>They &s;aw it was a <HI>civil war.</HI> It was their bu|&s;ine&s;s to per&s;uade their adver&s;aries that it ought to be a <HI>foreign</HI> war. The Jacobins every where &s;et up a cry again&s;t the new cru&s;ade; and they intrigued with effect in the cabinet, in the field, and in every private &s;ociety in Europe. Their ta&s;k was not difficult. The condition of Princes, and &s;ometimes of fir&s;t Mini&s;ters too, is to be pitied. The creatures of the de&s;k, and
<PB N="89" REF="94">
the creatures of favour, had no reli&s;h for the principles of the manife&s;toes. They pro|mi&s;ed no governments, no regiments, no reve|nues from whence emoluments might ari&s;e, by perqui&s;ite or by grant. In truth, the tribe of vulgar politicians are the lowe&s;t of our &s;pecies. There is no trade &s;o vile and mechanical as go|vernment in their hands. Virtue is not their habit. They are out of them&s;elves in any cour&s;e of conduct recommended only by con&s;cience and glory. A large, liberal, and pro&s;pective view of the intere&s;ts of States pa&s;&s;es with them for romance; and the principles that recom|mended it for the wanderings of a di&s;ordered imagination. The calculators compute them out of their &s;en&s;es. The je&s;ters and buffoons &s;hame them out of every thing grand and ele|vated. Littlene&s;s in object and in means, to them appears &s;oundne&s;s and &s;obriety. They think there is nothing worth pur&s;uit, but that which they can handle; which they can mea&s;ure with a two-foot rule; which they can tell upon ten fingers.</P>
<P>Without their principles, perhaps without any principles at all, they played the game of the Jacobins. There was a beaten road before them. The Powers of Europe were armed; France had always appeared dangerous; the
<PB N="90" REF="95">
war was ea&s;ily diverted from France as a fac|tion, to France as a &s;tate. The Princes were ea&s;ily taught to &s;lide back into their old habitual cour&s;e of politicks. They were ea&s;ily led to con&s;ider the flames that were con&s;uming France, not as a warning to protect their own buildings, (which were without any party wall, and linked by a contignation into the edifice of France,) as an happy occa&s;ion for the pillag|ing the goods, and for carrying off the materials of their neighbour's hou&s;e. Their provident fears were changed into avaricious hopes. They car|ried on their new de&s;igns without &s;eeming to abandon the principles of their old policy. They pretended to &s;eek, or they flattered them&s;elves that they &s;ought, in the acce&s;&s;ion of new for|tre&s;&s;es, and new territories, a <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> &s;ecurity. But the &s;ecurity wanted was again&s;t a kind of power, which was not dangerous in its for|tre&s;&s;es nor in it's territories, but in it's &s;pirit and it's principles. They aimed, or pretended to aim, at <HI>defending</HI> them&s;elves again&s;t a danger, from which there can be no &s;ecurity in any <HI>de|fen&s;ive</HI> plan. If armies and fortre&s;&s;es were a de|fence again&s;t Jacobini&s;m, Louis the Sixteenth would this day reign a powerful monarch over an happy people.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="96">
This error obliged them, even in their offen|&s;ive operations, to adopt a plan of war, again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s of which there was &s;omething little &s;hort of mathematical demon&s;tration. They refu&s;ed to take any &s;tep which might &s;trike at the heart of affairs. They &s;eemed unwilling to wound the enemy in any vital part. They acted through the whole, as if they really wi&s;hed the con&s;ervation of the Jacobin power; as what might be more favourable than the lawful Go|vernment to the attainment of the petty objects they looked for. They always kept on the cir|cumference; and the wider and remoter the circle was, the more eagerly they cho&s;e as their &s;phere of action. The plan they pur&s;ued, in it's na|ture demanded great length of time. In it's execution they who went the neare&s;t way to work were obliged to cover an incredible ex|tent of country. It left to the enemy every means of de&s;troying this extended line of weakne&s;s. Ill &s;ucce&s;s in any part was &s;ure to defeat the effect of the whole. This is true of Au&s;tria. It is &s;till more true of England. On this fal&s;e plan, even good fortune, by further weakening the victor, put him but the further off from his object.</P>
<P>As long as there was any appearance of &s;uc|ce&s;s, the &s;pirit of aggrandizement, and con&s;e|cuently
<PB N="92" REF="97">
the &s;pirit of mutual jealou&s;y &s;eized upon all the coale&s;ced Powers. Some &s;ought an ac|ce&s;&s;ion of territory at the expence of France, &s;ome at the expence of each other, &s;ome at the expence of third parties; and when the vici&s;&s;i|tude of di&s;a&s;ter took it's turn, they found com|mon di&s;tre&s;s a treacherous bond of faith and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t &s;kill conducting the greate&s;t military apparatus has been employed; but it has been wor&s;e than u&s;ele&s;sly employed, through the fal&s;e policy of the war. The ope|rations of the field &s;uffered by the errors of the Cabinet. If the &s;ame &s;pirit continues when peace is made, the peace will fix and perpetuate all the errors of the war; becau&s;e it will be made upon the &s;ame fal&s;e principle. What has been lo&s;t in the field, in the field may be regained. An arrangement of peace in it's na|ture is a permanent &s;ettlement; it is the effect of coun&s;el and deliberation, and not of fortui|tous events. If built upon &s;ome ba&s;is totally and fundamentally erroneous, it can only be retrieved by &s;ome of tho&s;e unfore&s;een di&s;po&s;i|tions, which the all-wi&s;e but my&s;terious Go|vernor of the World, &s;ometimes interpo&s;es, to &s;natch nations from ruin. It would not be a pious error, but a mad and impious pre&s;ump|tion
<PB N="93" REF="98">
for any one to tru&s;t in an unknown order of di&s;pen&s;ations, in defiance of the rules of pru|dence, which are formed upon the known march of the ordinary providence of God. It was not of that &s;ort of war that I was among&s;t the lea&s;t con&s;iderable, but among&s;t the mo&s;t zealous advi&s;ers; and it is not by the &s;ort of peace now talked of that I wi&s;h it concluded.</P>
<P>It would be to no great purpo&s;e to enter into the particular errours of the war. The whole has been but one errour. It was but nomi|nally a war of alliance. As the allies pur|&s;ued it there was nothing to hold an alli|ance together. There could be no tie of <HI>honour,</HI> in a &s;ociety for pillage. There could be no tie in a common <HI>intere&s;t</HI> where the object did not offer &s;uch a divi&s;ion among&s;t the parties, as could be equalized. The partition of Poland offered an object of &s;poil in which the parties <HI>might</HI> agree. They were circumjacent; and each might take a portion convenient to his own territory. They might di&s;pute about the value; but the contiguity to each of the demandants always furni&s;hed the means of an adju&s;tment. Though hereafter the world will have cau&s;e to rue this iniquitous mea&s;ure, for the moment there was wherewithal in the object to pre&s;erve peace among&s;t confederates in wrong. But in
<PB N="94" REF="99">
the &s;poil of France, it was obvious that this &s;cheme did not afford the &s;ame facilities for ac|commodation. What might &s;atisfy the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria in her Flemi&s;h frontier afforded no equivalent to tempt the cupidity of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. What might be de&s;ired by Great Bri|tain in the We&s;t-Indies, could be coldly and remotely, if at all, felt as an intere&s;t at Vienna; and it would be felt as &s;omething wor&s;e than a negative intere&s;t at Madrid. Au&s;tria, long po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with unwi&s;e and dangerous de&s;igns on Italy, could not be very much in earne&s;t about the con&s;ervation of the old patrimony of the Hou&s;e of Savoy: and Sardinia, who owed to an Italian force all her means of &s;hutting out France from Italy, of which &s;he has been &s;up|po&s;ed to hold the key, would not purcha&s;e the means of &s;trength upon one &s;ide by yielding it on the other. She would not readily give the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Novara for the hope of Savoy. No continental Power was willing to lo&s;e any of it's continental objects for the encrea&s;e of the naval power of Great Britain; and Great Bri|tain would not give up any of the objects &s;he &s;ought for as the means of an encrea&s;e to her naval power, to further their aggrandizement. There was no method of equalizing their &s;everal preten&s;ions. They are things incommen&s;urable. The moment this war came to be con&s;idered as

a war merely of profit, the actual circum|&s;tances are &s;uch, that it never could become really a war of alliance. Nor can the peace be a peace of alliance, until things are put upon their right bottom.</P>
<P>I don't find it denied, that when a treaty is entered into for peace, a demand will be made on the Regicides to &s;urrender their conque&s;ts on the Continent. Will they, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the war, make that &s;urrender without an equivalent? This continental ce&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be made in favour of that party in the alliance, that has &s;uffered lo&s;&s;es. That party has nothing to furni&s;h towards an equivalent. What equi|valent, for in&s;tance, has Holland to offer, who has lo&s;t her all? What equivalent can come from the Emperor, every part of who&s;e territo|ries contiguous to France, is already within the pale of the Regicide dominion? What equiva|lent has Sardinia to offer for Savoy and for Nice? What has &s;he taken from the faction of France? She has lo&s;t much; and &s;he has gained nothing. What equivalent has Spain to give? Alas! &s;he has already paid for her own ran&s;om the fund of equivalent, and a dreadful equiva|lent it is, to England and to her&s;elf. But I put Spain out of the que&s;tion. She is a province of the Jacobin Empire. She is in a &s;hocking dilemma.
<PB N="96" REF="101">
In effect and &s;ub&s;tance, her Crown is a fief of Regicide&mdash;Whence then can the compen&s;ation be demanded, but from that power which alone has made &s;ome conque&s;ts? That power is England. Will the Allies then give away their ancient patrimony, that England may keep I&s;lands in the We&s;t In|dies? They can never protract the war in good earne&s;t for that object. Nor can they act in concert with us, in our refu&s;al to grant any thing towards their redemption. In that ca&s;e we are thus &s;ituated&mdash;Either we mu&s;t give Europe, bound hand and foot to France; or we mu&s;t quit the We&s;t Indies without any one object, great or &s;mall, towards indemnity and &s;ecurity. If we look to the Ea&s;t, our mo&s;t decided conque&s;ts (&s;ome of them the mo&s;t important) are there. I look at the taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Cape of Good Hope to be the &s;ecuring a po&s;t of great moment: it is a mea|&s;ure which does infinite honour to tho&s;e who planned it, and to tho&s;e who executed that en|terprize. I &s;peak of it always as <HI>comparatively</HI> good; as good as any thing in this &s;cheme of war, which repels us from an, and em|ploys all our forces, where nothing can be finally deci&s;ive. It is evident, that if we keep our ea&s;tern conque&s;ts, we keep them at the ex|pence of Holland, our ally; the immediate
<PB N="97" REF="102">
cau&s;e of the war, the nation whom we had un|dertaken to protect, and not of the Republic which it was our bu&s;ine&s;s to de&s;troy. If we re|turn the African and the Afiatic conque&s;ts, we put them into the hands of a nominal State, (to that Holland is reduced) unable to retain them; and which will virtually leave them under the direction of France. If we withhold them, Holland declines &s;till more as a State: and &s;he lo&s;es that carriage and that means of keeping up the &s;mall degree of naval power &s;he holds; for which policy, and not for any commerical gain, &s;he maintains the Cape, or any &s;ettlement be|yond it. It that ca&s;e, re&s;entment, faction, and even nece&s;&s;ity will throw her more and more into the power of the new mi&s;chievous Repub|lic. But on the probable &s;tate of Holland, I &s;hall &s;ay more, when I come to talk over with you the &s;tate in which any &s;ort of Jacobin peace will leave all Europe.</P>
<P>So far as to the Ea&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>As to the We&s;t-Indies, indeed as to either, if we look for matter of exchange in order to ran|&s;ome Europe, it is ea&s;y to &s;hew that we have taken a terrible round-about road. I cannot conceive, even if, for the &s;ake of holding con|que&s;ts there, we &s;hould refu&s;e to redeem Hol|land,

and the Au&s;trian Netherlands, and the hither Germany, that Spain, merely as &s;he is Spain, (and forgetting that the Regicide Am|ba&s;&s;ador governs at Madrid) will &s;ee with per|fect &s;atisfaction, Great Britain &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of the I&s;les. In truth it appears to me, that, when we come to balance our account, we &s;hall find in the propo&s;ed peace only the pure, &s;imple, and unendowed charms of Jacobin amity. We &s;hall have the &s;atisfaction of knowing, that no blood or trea&s;ure has been &s;pared by the allies for &s;up|port of the Regicide &s;y&s;tem. They will reflect at lei&s;ure on one great truth, that it was ten times more ea&s;y totally to de&s;troy the &s;y&s;tem it|&s;elf, than when e&s;tabli&s;hed, it would be to re|duce its power&mdash;and that this Republic, mo&s;t formidable abroad, was, of all things, the weak|e&s;t at home. That her frontier was terrible&mdash;her interior feeble&mdash;that it was matter of choice to attack her where &s;he is invincible; and to &s;pare her where &s;he was ready to di&s;&s;olve by her own internal di&s;orders.

<P>My dear Friend, I hold it impo&s;&s;ible that the&s;e con&s;iderations &s;hould have e&s;caped the State&s;man on both &s;ides of the water, and on both &s;ides of the Hou&s;e of Commons. How a

que&s;tion of peace can be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed without hav|ing them in view, I cannot imagine. If you or others &s;ee a way out of the&s;e difficulties I am happy. I &s;ee indeed a fund from whence equi|valents will be propo&s;ed. I &s;ee it. But I can|not ju&s;t now touch it. It is a que&s;tion of high moment. It opens another Iliad of woes to Europe.</P>
<P>Such is the time propo&s;ed for making <HI>a com|mon political peace,</HI> to which no one circum&s;tance is propitious. As to the grand principle of the peace, it is left, as if by common con&s;ent, wholly out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me, as if the two parties, who have long divided and di&s;tracted this kingdom, without abandoning their animo&s;ities, had come to an agreement in their &s;entiments. It looks as if they concurred in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Jaco|bini&s;m in France, and in the nece&s;&s;ity, if not in the advantage, of admitting it as a &s;ociable and natural member in the republic of Chri&s;t|endom. So far, and no farther, they are agreed among&s;t them&s;elves. Our dome&s;tic peace re|mains where it was; and we &s;eek to make amends for this dome&s;tic di&s;traction, by giving (as far as it is in our power to give it) peace and e&s;tabli&s;hment to our enemies. In this
<PB N="100" REF="105">
peace to our foe, we are taught to look, it &s;eems, for the term of all our own evils.</P>
<P>Viewing things in this light, I have frequently &s;unk into a degree of de&s;pondency and dejec|tion hardly to be de&s;cribed: yet out of the profounde&s;t depths of this de&s;pair, an impul&s;e which I have in vain endeavoured to re&s;i&s;t, has urged me to rai&s;e one feeble cry again&s;t this unfortunate coalition which is formed at home, in order to make a coalition with France, &s;ubver&s;ive of the whole ancient order of the world. No di&s;a&s;ter of war, no calamity of &s;ea&s;on could ever &s;trike me with half the horror which I felt from what is introduced to us by this junction of parties, under the &s;oothing name of peace. We are apt to &s;peak of a low and pu|fillanimous &s;pirit as the ordinary cau&s;e by which dubious wars terminate in humiliating treaties. It is here the direct contrary. I am perfectly a&s;toni&s;hed at the boldne&s;s of character, at the intrepidity of mind, the firmne&s;s of nerve, in tho&s;e who are able with deliberation to face the perils of Jacobin fraternity.</P>
<P>This fraternity is indeed &s;o terrible in it's nature, and in it's manife&s;t con&s;equences, that there is no way of quieting our apprehen&s;ions about it, but by totally putting it out of &s;ight,
<PB N="101" REF="106">
by &s;ub&s;tituting for it, through a &s;ort of periphra|&s;is, &s;omething of an ambiguous quality, and de&s;cribing &s;uch a connection under the terms of <Q REND="inline">"<HI>the u&s;ual relations of peace and amity:</HI>"</Q> By this means the propo&s;ed fraternity is hu&s;tled in the crowd of tho&s;e treaties, which imply no change in the public law of Europe, and which do not upon &s;y&s;tem affect the interior condition of na|tions. It is confounded with tho&s;e conventions in which matters of di&s;pute among &s;overeign powers are compromi&s;ed, by the taking off a duty more or le&s;s, by the &s;urrender of a frontier town, or a di&s;puted di&s;trict on the one &s;ide or the other; by pactions in which the preten&s;ions of families are &s;ettled, (as by a conveyancer, making family &s;ub&s;titutions and &s;ucce&s;&s;ions) without any alte|ration in the laws, manners, religion, privileges and cu&s;toms of the cities or territories which are the &s;ubject of &s;uch arrangements.</P>
<P>All this body of old conventions, compo&s;ing the va&s;t and voluminous collection called the <HI>corps diplomatique,</HI> forms the code or &s;tatute law, as the methodized rea&s;onings of the great pub|lici&s;ts and juri&s;ts form the dige&s;t and juri&s;pru|dence of the Chri&s;tian world. In the&s;e trea|&s;ures are to be found the <HI>u&s;ual</HI> relations of peace and amity in civilized Europe; and there the
<PB N="102" REF="107">
relations of ancient France were to be found among&s;t the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem in France is not the an|cient France. It is not the ancient France with ordinary ambition and ordinary means. It is not a new power of an old kind. It is a new power of a new &s;pecies. When &s;uch a que&s;tionable &s;hape is to be admitted for the fir&s;t time into the bro|therhood of Chri&s;tendom, it is not a matter of idle curio&s;ity to con&s;ider how far it is in it's na|ture alliable with the re&s;t, or whether <Q REND="inline">"the re|lations of peace and amity"</Q> with this new State are likely to be of the &s;ame nature with the <HI>u&s;ual</HI> relations of the States of Europe.</P>
<P>The Revolution in France had the relation of France to other nations as one of it's princi|pal objects. The changes made by that Revo|lution were not the better to accommodate her to the old and u&s;ual relations, but to produce new ones. The Revolution was made, not to make France free, but to make her formid|able; not to make her a neighbour, but a mi&s;|tre&s;s; not to make her more ob&s;ervant of laws, but to put her in a condition to impo&s;e them. To make France truly formidable it was nece&s;|&s;ary that France &s;hould be new modelled. They
<PB N="103" REF="108">
who have not followed the train of the late pro|ceedings, have been led by deceitful repre&s;enta|tions (which deceit made a part in the plan) to conceive that this totally new model of a &s;tate, in which nothing e&s;caped a change, was made with a view to its internal relations only.</P>
<P>In the Revolution of France two &s;orts of men were principally concerned in giving a character and determination to its pur&s;uits; the philo&s;o|phers and the politicians. They took different ways, but they met in the &s;ame end. The philo|&s;ophers had one predominant object, which they pur&s;ued with a fanatical fury, that is, the utter extirpation of religion. To that every que&s;tion of empire was &s;ubordinate. They had rather domi|neer in a pari&s;h of Athei&s;ts, than rule over a Chri&s;|tian world. Their temporal ambition was wholly &s;ub&s;ervient to their pro&s;elytizing &s;pirit, in which they were not exceeded by Mahomet him&s;elf.</P>
<P>They who have made but &s;uperficial &s;tudies in the natural hi&s;tory of the human mind, have been taught to look on religious opinions as the only cau&s;e of enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal, and &s;ec|tarian propagation. But there is no doctrine whatever, on which men can warm, that is not capable of the very &s;ame effect. The &s;ocial nature of man impels him to propagate his prin|ciples,
<PB N="104" REF="109">
as much as phy&s;ical impul&s;es urge him to propagate his kind. The pa&s;&s;ions give zeal and vehemence. The under&s;tanding be&s;tows de&s;ign and &s;y&s;tem. The whole man moves under the di&s;cipline of his opinions. Religion is among the mo&s;t powerful cau&s;es of enthu&s;ia&s;m. When any thing concerning it becomes an object of much meditation, it cannot be indifferent to the mind. They who do not love religion, hate it. The rebels to God perfectly abhor the Author of their being. They hate him <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"with all their heart, with all their mind, with all their &s;oul, and with all their &s;trength."</Q> He never pre|&s;ents him&s;elf to their thoughts, but to menace and alarm them. They cannot &s;trike the Sun out of Heaven, but they are able to rai&s;e as moulder|ing &s;moke that ob&s;cures him from their own eyes. Not being able to revenge them&s;elves on God, they have a delight in vicariou&s;ly defacing, degrading, torturing, and tearing in pieces his image in man. Let no one judge of them by what he has conceived of them, when they were not incorporated, and had no lead. They were then only pa&s;&s;engers in a common vehicle. They were then carried along with the general motion of religion in the community, and with|out being aware of it, partook of its influence. In that &s;ituation, at wor&s;t their nature was left free to counterwork their principles. They de|&s;paired
<PB N="105" REF="110">
of giving any very general currency to their opinions. They con&s;ideder them as a re|&s;erved privilege for the cho&s;en few. But when the po&s;&s;ibility of dominion; lead, and propaga|tion pre&s;ented them&s;elves, and that the ambi|tion, which before had &s;o often made them hy|pocrites, might rather gain than lo&s;e by a daring avowal of their &s;entiments, then the nature of this infernal &s;pirit, which has <Q REND="inline">"evil for its good,"</Q> appeared in its full perfection. Nothing, indeed, but the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome power can, with any certainty, di&s;cover what at the bottom is the true character of any man. Without read|ing the &s;peeches of Verginaux, Fran&ccedil;ais of Nantz, I&s;nard, and &s;ome others of that &s;ort, it would not be ea&s;y to conceive the pa&s;&s;ion, ran|cour, and malice of their tongues and hearts. They worked them&s;elves up to a perfect phrenzy again&s;t religion and all its profe&s;&s;ors. They tore the deputation of the Clergy to pieces by their infuriated declamations and invectives, be|fore they lacerated their bodies by their ma&s;|&s;acres. This fanatical athei&s;m left out, we omit the principal feature in the French Revolution, and a principal con&s;ideration with regard to the effects to be expected from a peace with it.</P>
<P>The other &s;ort of men were the politicians. To them who had little or not at all reflected on
<PB N="106" REF="111">
the &s;ubject, religion was in it&s;elf no object of love or hatred. They di&s;believed it, and that was all. Neutral with regard to that object, they took the &s;ide which, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, might be&s;t an&s;wer their purpo&s;es. They &s;oon found that they could not do without the philo|&s;ophers; and the philo&s;ophers &s;oon made them &s;en&s;ible, that the de&s;truction of religion was to &s;upply them with means of conque&s;t fir&s;t at home, and then abroad. The philo&s;ophers were the active internal agitators, and &s;upplied the &s;pirit and principles: the &s;econd gave the general direction. Sometimes the one predo|minated in the compo&s;ition, &s;ometimes the other. The only difference between them was in the nece&s;&s;ity of concealing the general de&s;ign for a time, and in dealing with foreign nations; the fanaticks going &s;traight forward and openly, the politicians by the &s;urer mode of zig-zag. In the cour&s;e of events, this, among other cau&s;es, produced fierce and bloody contentions between them. But at the bottom they tho|roughly agreed in all the objects of ambition and irreligion, and &s;ub&s;tantially in all the means of promoting the&s;e ends.</P>
<P>Without que&s;tion, to bring about the un|exampled event of the French Revolution, the concurrence of a very great number of views
<PB N="107" REF="112">
and pa&s;&s;ions was nece&s;&s;ary. In that &s;tupen|dous work, no one principle by which the hu|man mind may have it's faculties at once in|vigorated and depraved, was left unemployed: but I can &s;peak it to a certainty, and &s;upport it by undoubted proofs, that the ruling prin|ciple of tho&s;e who acted in the Revolution <HI>as &s;tate&s;men,</HI> had the exterior aggrandizement of France as their ultimate end in the mo&s;t minute part of the interior changes that were made. We, who of late years, have been drawn from an attention to foreign affairs by the importance of our dome&s;tic di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, cannot ea&s;ily form a conception of the general eagerne&s;s of the French nation, previous to it's revolution, upon that &s;ubject. I am convinced that the foreign &s;pe|culators in France, under the old Government, were twenty to one of the &s;ame de&s;cription in England; and few of that de&s;cription there were, who did not emulou&s;ly &s;et forward the Revolu|tion. The whole official &s;y&s;tem, particularly in the diplomatic part, the regulars, the irregulars, down to the clerks in office (a corps, without all compari&s;on, more numerous than the &s;ame de&s;cription among&s;t us) co-operated in it. All the intriguers in foreign politicks, all the &s;pies, all the intelligencers, actually or late in function, all the candidates for that &s;ort of employment, acted &s;olely upon that principle.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="113">
On that &s;y&s;tem of aggrandizement there was but one mind: but two violent factions aro&s;e about the means. The fir&s;t wi&s;hed France, diverted from the politicks of the Continent, to attend &s;olely to her marine, to feed it by an encrea&s;e of commerce, and thereby to overpower England on her own element. They contended, that if England were di&s;abled, the Powers on the Continent would fall into their proper &s;ubordination; that it was England which deranged the whole conti|nental &s;y&s;tem of Europe. The others, who were by far the more numerous, though not the mo&s;t outwardly prevalent at Court, con&s;idered this plan as contrary to her genius, her &s;ituation, and her natural means. They agreed as to the ultimate object, the reduction of the Briti&s;h power; but they con&s;idered an a&s;cendancy on the Continent as a nece&s;&s;ary preliminary to that undertaking. They argued, that the proceed|ings of England her&s;elf had proved the &s;ound|ne&s;s of this policy. That her greate&s;t and able&s;t State&s;men had not con&s;idered the &s;upport of a continental balance again&s;t France as a devia|tion from the principle of her naval power, but as one of the mo&s;t effectual modes of carrying it into effect. That &s;uch had been her po|licy &s;ince the Revolution; during which pe|riod the naval &s;trength of Great Britain had
<PB N="109" REF="114">
gone on encrea&s;ing in the direct ratio of her interference in the politicks of the conti|nent. With much &s;tronger rea&s;on ought the politicks of France to take the &s;ame direction: as well for pur&s;uing objects which her &s;ituation would dictate to her, if England had no exi&s;t|ence, as for counteracting the politicks of that nation; to France continental politicks are pri|mary; they are only of &s;econdary con&s;ideration to England.</P>
<P>What is truly a&s;toni&s;hing, the partizans of tho&s;e two oppo&s;ite &s;y&s;tems were at once preva|lent, and at once employed, and in the very &s;ame tran&s;actions, the one o&s;ten&s;ibly, the other &s;ecretly, during the latter part of the reign of Lewis XV. Nor was there one Court in which an Amba&s;&s;ador re&s;ided on the part of the Mi|ni&s;ters, in which another as a &s;py on him did not al&s;o re&s;ide on the part of the King. They who pur&s;ued the &s;cheme for keeping peace on the continent, and particularly with Au&s;tria, acting officially and publickly, the other fac|tion counteracting and oppo&s;ing them. The&s;e private agents were continually going from their function to the Ba&s;tille, from the Ba&s;tille to em|ployment, and to intere&s;t or favour again. An inextricable cabal was formed, &s;ome of per&s;ons of rank, others of &s;ubordinates. But by this
<PB N="110" REF="115">
means the corps of politicians was augmented in number, and the whole formed a body of active, adventuring, ambitious, di&s;contented people, de&s;pi&s;ing the regular Mini&s;try, de&s;pi&s;|ing the Courts at which they were employed, de&s;pi&s;ing the Courts which employed them.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Lewis the Sixteenth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be right to do ju&s;tice to Lewis XVI. He did what he could to de&s;troy the double diplomacy of France.

<P>There was no point on which the di&s;contented diplomatic politicians &s;o bitterly arraigned their Cabinet, as for the decay of the French influ|ence in all others. From quarrelling with the Court, they began to complain of Mo|narchy it&s;elf; as a &s;y&s;tem of Government too variable for any regular plan of national ag|grandizement. They ob&s;erved, that in that &s;ort of regimen too much depended on the per&s;onal character of the Prince; that the vi|ci&s;&s;itudes produced by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Princes of a different character, and even the vici&s;&s;itudes produced in the &s;ame man, by the different views and inclinations belonging to youth, manhood, and age, di&s;turbed and di&s;tracted the policy of a country, made by nature for exten&s;ive empire, or what was &s;till more to their ta&s;te, for that &s;ort of general over-ruling influence which pre|pared empire or &s;upplied the place of it.

<PB N="112" REF="117">
&s;luctuations of a Monarchy. They ob&s;erved, the very &s;mall additions of territory which all the power of France, actuated by all the ambi|tion of France, had acquired in two centuries. The Romans had frequently acquired more in a &s;ingle year. They &s;everely and in every part of it criticifed the reign of Louis the XIVth, who&s;e irregular and de&s;ultory ambition had more provoked than endangered Europe. In|deed, they who will be at the pains of &s;eri|ou&s;ly con&s;idering the hi&s;tory of that period will &s;ee, that tho&s;e French politicians had &s;ome rea|&s;on.

Ru&s;&s;ia and Pru&s;&s;ia had been created almo&s;t within memory; and Au&s;|tria, though not a new power, and even cur|tailed in territory, was by the very colli&s;ion in which &s;he lo&s;t that territory, greatly improved in her military di&s;cipline and force: and that during the reign of Maria There&s;a the interior oeconomy of the country was made more to cor|re&s;pond with the &s;upport of great armies than formerly it had been. As to Pru&s;&s;ia, a merely military power, they ob&s;erved that one war had enriched her with as con&s;iderable a conque&s;t as France had acquired in centuries. Ru&s;&s;ia had broken the Turki&s;h power by which Au&s;tria might be, as formerly &s;he had been, balanced in favour of France. They felt it with pain, that the two northern powers of Sweden and Denmark were in general under the &s;way of Ru&s;&s;ia; or that at be&s;t, France kept up a very doubtful conflict, with many fluctuations of fortune, and at an enormous expence in Swe|den.

This alli|ance, they &s;aid, extingui&s;hed Spain by de&s;troying all it's energy, without adding any thing to the real power of France in the acce&s;&s;ion of the forces of it's great rival. In Italy, the &s;ame family accommodation, the &s;ame national in&s;ignificance were equally vi&s;ible. What cure for the radical weakne&s;s of the French Monarchy, to which all the means which wit could devi&s;e, or nature and fortune could be&s;tow, towards univer&s;al empire, was not of force to give life, or vigour, or con&s;i&s;tency,&mdash;but in a republick?

When I was in Paris in 1773, the treaty of 1756 between Au&s;tria and France was deplored as a national calamity; becau&s;e it united France in friend&s;hip with a Power, at who&s;e expence alone they could hope any continental aggran|dizement. When the fir&s;t partition of Poland was made, in which France had no &s;hare, and which had farther aggrandized every one of the three Powers of which they were mo&s;t jealous, I found them in a perfect phrenzy of rage and indignation: Not that they were hurt at the &s;hocking and uncoloured violence and inju&s;tice of that partition, but at the debility, improvi|dence, and want of activity in their Govern|ment, in not preventing it as a means of aggran|dizement to their rivals, or in not contriving, by exchanges of &s;ome kind or other, to obtain their &s;hare of advantage from that robbery.</P>
<P>In that, or nearly in that &s;tate of things and of opinions, came the Au&s;trian match which promi&s;ed to draw the knot, as after|wards in effect it did, &s;till more clo&s;ely be|tween the old rival hou&s;es. This added ex|ceedingly to their hatred and contempt of their monarchy. It was for this rea&s;on that the late glorious Queen, who on all accounts was formed to produce general love and admiration, and who&s;e life was as mild and beneficent as her

death was beyond example great and heroic, be|came &s;o very &s;oon and &s;o very much the object of an implacable rancour, never to be extin|gui&s;hed but in her blood. When I wrote my letter in an&s;wer to M. de Menonville, in the beginning of January, 1791, I had good rea&s;on for thinking that this de&s;cription of revolu|tioni&s;ts did not &s;o early nor &s;o &s;teadily point their murderous de&s;igns at the martyr King as at the Royal Heroine.

<P>From this their re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire of an over-rul|ing influence, they bent a very great part of their de&s;igns and efforts to revive the old French, which was a democratic party in Holland, and to make a revolution there. They were happy at the troubles which the &s;ingular imprudence of Jo&s;eph the Second had &s;tirred up in the Au&s;|trian Netherlands. They rejoiced, when they &s;aw him irritate his &s;ubjects, profe&s;s philo|&s;ophy, &s;end away the Dutch garri&s;ons, and di&s;mantle his fortifications. As to Holland, they never forgave either the King or the Mini|&s;try, for &s;uffering that object, which they ju&s;tly looked on as principal in their de&s;ign of reduc|ing the power of England, to e&s;cape out of their

hands. This was the true &s;ecret of the com|mercial treaty, made, on their part, again&s;t all the old rules and principles of commerce, with a view of diverting the Engli&s;h nation, by an at|tention to profit, from an attention to the pro|gre&s;s of France in it's de&s;igns upon that Repub|lic. The &s;y&s;tem of the oeconomi&s;ts, which led to the general opening of commerce, facilitated that treaty, but did not produce it. They were in de&s;pair when they found that the object, to which they had &s;acrificed their manufactures, was lo&s;t to their ambition. Above all, this eager de|&s;ire of rai&s;ing France from the condition into which &s;he had fallen, as they conceived, from her monarchical imbecility, had been the main &s;pring of their precedent interference in that un|happy American quarrel, the bad effects of which to this nation have not, as yet, fully di&s;clo&s;ed them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments had been long lurking in their brea&s;ts, though their views were only di&s;|covered now and then, in heat and as by e&s;capes; but on this occa&s;ion they exploded &s;uddenly.

The di&s;cour&s;es and cabals that it pro|duced, the intercour&s;e that it e&s;tabli&s;hed, and above all, the example, which made it &s;eem prac|ticable to e&s;tabli&s;h a Republick in a great extent of country, fini&s;hed the work, and gave to that part of the Revolutionary faction a degree of &s;trength which required other energies than the late King po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to re&s;i&s;t, or even to re&s;train. It &s;pread every where; but it was no where more prevalent than in the heart of the Court. The palace of Ver&s;ailles, by its language, &s;eemed a forum of democracy. To point out to mo&s;t of tho&s;e politicians, from the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions and move|ments, what has &s;ince happened, the fall of their own Monarchy, of their own Laws, of their own Religion, would have been to furni&s;h a motive the more for pu&s;hing forward a &s;y&s;tem on which they con&s;idered all the&s;e things as incumbrances.</P>
<P>When I contemplate the &s;cheme on which France is formed, and when I compare it with the&s;e &s;y&s;tems, with which it is, and ever mu&s;t be in conflict, the&s;e things which &s;eem as defects in her polity, are the very things which make me tremble.

The objects which they em|brace are of the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible variety, and have become in a manner infinite. In all the&s;e old countries the &s;tate has been made to the people, and not the people conformed to the &s;tate.

This comprehen&s;ive &s;cheme, vir|tually produced a degree of per&s;onal liberty in forms the mo&s;t adver&s;e to it. That was found, un|der monarchies &s;tiled ab&s;olute, in a degree un|known to the ancient commonwealths. From hence the powers of all our modern &s;tates, meet in all their movements, with &s;ome ob&s;truction. It is therefore no wonder, that when the&s;e &s;tates are to be con&s;idered as machines to operate for &s;ome one great end, that this di&s;&s;ipated and balanced force is not ea&s;ily concentred, or made to bear upon one point.</P>

and is the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to &s;acrifice any one of them to another, or to the whole. It aims at taking in the whole circle of human de&s;ires, and &s;ecuring for them their fair enjoyment. Our le|gi&s;lature has been ever clo&s;ely connected, in it's mo&s;t efficient part, with individual feeling and indivi|dual intere&s;t. Per&s;onal liberty, the mo&s;t lively of the&s;e feelings and the mo&s;t important of the&s;e in|tere&s;ts, which in other European countries has rather ari&s;en from the &s;y&s;tem of manners and the habitudes of life, than from the laws of the &s;tate, (in which it flouri&s;hed more from neglect than at|tention) in England, has been a direct object of Government.</P>
<P>Fortunately, the great riches of this kingdom, ari&s;ing from a variety of cau&s;es, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the people, which is as great to &s;pend as to accu|mulate, has ea&s;ily afforded a di&s;po&s;eable &s;urplus that gives a mighty momentum to the &s;tate. This dif|ficulty, with the&s;e advantages to overcome it, has called forth the talents of the Engli&s;h financiers, who, by the &s;urplus of indu&s;try poured out by pro|digality, has outdone every thing which has been accompli&s;hed in other nations. The pre&s;ent Mi|ni&s;ter has outdone his predece&s;&s;ors; and as a Mini&s;ter of revenue, is far above my power of prai&s;e. But &s;till there are ca&s;es in which Eng|land feels more than &s;everal others, (though they

What now &s;tands as Government in France is &s;truck out at a heat. The de&s;ign is wicked, im|moral, impious, oppre&s;&s;ive; but it is &s;pirited and daring: it is &s;y&s;tematick; it is &s;imple in it's princi|ple; it has unity and con&s;i&s;tency in perfection. In that country entirely to cut off a branch of com|merce, to extingui&s;h a manufacture, to de&s;troy the circulation of money, to violate credit, to &s;u&s;pend the cour&s;e of agriculture, even to burn a city, or to lay wa&s;te a province of their own, does not co&s;t them a moment's anxiety. To them, the will, the wi&s;h, the want, the liberty, the toil, the blood of indivi|duals is as nothing. Individuality is left out of their &s;cheme of Government. The &s;tate is all in all. Every thing is referred to the production of force; afterwards every thing is tru&s;ted to the u&s;e of it. It is military in it's principle, in it's maxims, in it's &s;pirit, and in all it's movements. The &s;tate has dominion and conque&s;t for it's &s;ole objects; do|minion over minds by pro&s;elyti&s;m, over bodies by arms.</P>

Thus con&s;tituted with an immen&s;e body of na|tural means, which are le&s;&s;ened in their amount only to be encrea&s;ed in their effect, France has &s;ince the accompli&s;hment of the Revolution, a complete unity in it's direction. It has de&s;troyed every re&s;ource of the State, which depends upon opinion and the good-will of individuals. The riches of convention di&s;appear. The advantages of nature in &s;ome con&s;iderable mea&s;ure remain; the command over them is complete and ab&s;olute.

We have not con|&s;idered as we ought the dreadful energy of a State, in which the property has nothing to do with the Government. Reflect, my dear Sir, reflect again and again on a Government, in which the property is in &s;ubjection, and where nothing rules but the minds of de&s;perate men. The condition of a com|monwealth not governed by its property was a combination of things, which the learned and in|genious &s;peculator Harrington, who has to&s;&s;ed about &s;ociety into all forms, never could imagine to be po&s;&s;ible. We have &s;een it; the world has felt

The di&s;covery is dreadful, the mine exhau&s;tle&s;s. They have every thing to gain, and they have nothing to lo&s;e. They have a boundle&s;s inheritance in hope; and there is no medium for them, betwixt the highe&s;t elevation, and death with infamy. Never can tho&s;e, who from the mi&s;erable &s;ervitude of the de&s;k have been rai&s;ed to Empire, again &s;ubmit to the bondage of a &s;tarving bureau, or the profit of copying mu&s;ic, or writing plaidoyers by the &s;heet.

<P>The unhappy Lewis XVI. was a man of the be&s;t intentions that probably ever reigned. He was by no means deficient in talents. He had a mo&s;t laudable de&s;ire to &s;upply by general reading, and
<PB N="125" REF="130">
even by the acqui&s;ition of elemental knowledge, an education in all points originally defective; but nobody told him (and it was no wonder he &s;hould not him&s;elf divine it) that the world of which he read, and the world in which he lived, were no longer the &s;ame. De&s;irous of doing every thing for the be&s;t, fearful of cabal, di&s;tru&s;ting his own judgment, he &s;ought his Mini&s;ters of all kinds upon public te&s;timony. But as Courts are the field for caballers, the public is the theatre for mountebanks and impo&s;tors. The cure for both tho&s;e evils is in the di&s;cernment of the Prince. But an accurate and penetrating di&s;cernment is what in a young Prince could not be looked for.</P>
<P>His conduct in it's principle was not unwi&s;e; but like mo&s;t other of his well-meant de&s;igns, it failed in his hands. It failed partly from mere ill fortune, to which &s;peculators are rarely plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign that very large &s;hare to which &s;he is ju&s;tly entitled in all human affairs. The failure, perhaps, in part was owing to his &s;uffering his &s;y&s;tem to be vitiated and di&s;turbed by tho&s;e intrigues, which it is, hu|manly &s;peaking, impo&s;&s;ible wholly to prevent in Courts, or indeed under any form of Government. However, with the&s;e aberrations, he gave him&s;elf over to a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the &s;tate&s;man of publick opinion. In other things he thought that he might be a King on the terms of his predece&s;&s;ors. He
<PB N="126" REF="131">
&s;lattered him&s;elf, as mo&s;t men in his &s;ituation will, that he might con&s;ult his ea&s;e without danger to his &s;afety. It is not at all wonderful that both he and his Mini&s;ters, giving way abundantly in other re|&s;pects to innovation, &s;hould take up in policy with the tradition of their monarchy. Under his an|ce&s;tors the Monarchy had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and even been &s;trengthened by the generation or &s;upport of Re|publicks. Fir&s;t, the Swi&s;s Republicks grew un|der the guardian&s;hip of the French Monarchy. The Dutch Republicks were hatched and che|ri&s;hed under the &s;ame incubation. Afterwards, a republican con&s;titution was under it's influence e&s;tabli&s;hed in the empire again&s;t the preten&s;ions of it's Chief. Even whil&s;t the Monarchy of France, by a &s;eries of wars and negotiations, and la&s;tly by the treaties of We&s;tphalia, had obtained the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the Prote&s;tants in Germany as a law of the Empire, the &s;ame Monarchy under Louis the XIIIth, had force enough to de&s;troy the re|publican &s;y&s;tem of the Prote&s;tants at home.</P>
<P>Louis the XVIth was a diligent reader of hi&s;|tory. But the very lamp of prudence blinded him. The guide of human life led him a&s;tray. A &s;ilent revolution in the moral world preceded the politi|cal, and prepared it. It became of more impor|tance than ever what examples were given, and what mea&s;ures were adopted. Their cau&s;es no

longer lurked in the rece&s;&s;es of cabinets, or in the private con&s;piracies of the factious. They were no longer to be controlled by the force and influ|ence of the grandees, who formerly had been able to &s;tir up troubles by their di&s;contents, and to quiet them by their corruption. The chain of &s;ub|ordination, even in cabal and &s;edition, was broken in its mo&s;t important links. It was no longer the great and the populace. Other intere&s;ts were formed, other dependencies, other connexions, other communications. The middle cla&s;s had &s;welled far beyond its former proportions. Like whatever is the mo&s;t effectively rich and great in &s;ociety, that became the &s;eat of all the active poli|ticks; and the preponderating weight to decide on them. There were all the energies by which for|tune is acquired, there the con&s;equence of their &s;ucce&s;s. There were all the talents which a&s;&s;ert their preten&s;ions, and are impatient of the place which &s;ettled &s;ociety pre&s;cribes to them. The&s;e de&s;criptions had got between the great and the po|pulace; and the influence on the lower cla&s;&s;es was with them. The &s;pirit of ambition had ta|ken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this cla&s;s as violently as ever it had done of any other. They felt the importance of this &s;ituation. The corre&s;pondence of the monied and the mercantile world, the literary in|tercour&s;e of academies; but, above all, the pre&s;s, of which they had in a manner, entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="128" REF="133">
made a kind of electrick communication every where. The pre&s;s, in reality, has made every Go|vernment, in its &s;pirit, democratick. Without it the great, the fir&s;t movements could not, perhaps, have been given. But the &s;pirit of ambition, now for the fir&s;t time connected with the &s;pirit of &s;pe|culation, was not to be re&s;trained at will. There was no longer any means of arre&s;ting a principle in its cour&s;e. When Louis the XVIth. under the influence of the enemies to Monarchy, meant to found but one Republick, he &s;et up two. When he meant to take away half the crown of his neigh|bour, he lo&s;t the whole of his own. Louis the XVIth could not countenance a new Republick: yet between that dangerous lodgment for an enemy, which he had erected, and his throne, he had the whole Atlantick for a ditch. He had for an out|work the Engli&s;h nation it&s;elf, friendly to liberty, adver&s;e to that mode of it. He was &s;urrounded by a rampart of Monarchies, mo&s;t of them allied to him, and generally under his influence. Yet even thus &s;ecured, a Republic erected under his au&s;pices, and dependent on his power, became fatal to his throne. The very money which he had lent to &s;upport this Republick, by a good faith, which to him operated as perfidy, was punctually paid to his enemies, and became a re&s;ource in the hands of his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins.</P>

With this example before their eyes, does any Admini&s;tration in England, does any Admini&s;tra|tion in Au&s;tria really flatter it&s;elf, that it can crect, not on the remote &s;hores of the Atlantick, but in their view, in their vicinity, in ab&s;olute con|tact with one of them, not a commercial but a martial Republick&mdash;a Republick not of &s;imple hu&s;bandmen or fi&s;hermen, but of intriguers, and of warriors&mdash;a Republick of a character the mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s, the mo&s;t enterprizing, the mo&s;t impious, the mo&s;t fierce and bloody, the mo&s;t hypocritical and perfidious that ever has been &s;een, or indeed that can be conceived to exi&s;t, without their own certain ruin?</P>

<P>Here I &s;uffer you to breathe, and leave to your meditation what has occurred to me on the genius and character of the French Revolution. From having this before us, we may be better able to judge on the fir&s;t que&s;tion I propo&s;ed, that is, How far nations, called foreign, are likely to be affected with the &s;y&s;tem e&s;tabli&s;hed within that territory?

I mean to proceed next on the que&s;tion of her fa|cilities, from the internal &s;tate of other nations, and particularly of this, for obtaining her ends: but I ought to be aware, that my notions are controvert|ed.&mdash;I mean, therefore, in my next letter, to take notice of what, in that way, has been recommend|ed to me as the mo&s;t de&s;erving of notice. In the examination of tho&s;e pieces, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to di&s;cu&s;s &s;ome others of the topics I have recom|mended to your attention.</P>
<P>This di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, my Friend, will be long. But the matter is &s;erious; and if ever the fate of the world could be truly &s;aid to depend in a particular mea&s;ure, it is upon this peace. For the pre&s;ent, farewell.</P>
