<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO be engaged in a contention with in|gratitude and fraud, is neither plea&s;ing nor honourable; but they who in di&s;charging the &s;acred obligations of friend&s;hip are forced into it, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the humiliation. They would them&s;elves be criminal in the next de|gree, were they to con&s;ult their own per&s;onal feelings; they are bound to con&s;ider only their duty.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the pre&s;ent year, a confidential paper, written by the late Mr. Burke, was &s;urreptitiou&s;ly publi&s;hed in his name; and at the end of it was adverti&s;ed a volume of pretended memoirs, anecdotes, and letters, of the Author. Some of his friends (he was him&s;elf at Bath, &s;truggling with the di&s;ea&s;e which ultimately proved fatal to him) obtained an injunction from the Court of
<PB N="2" REF="3">
Chancery, on the very day of publication. By this prompt interference of the law, by the general di&s;countenance of all liberal men, and by the bankruptcy of the book&s;eller, which &s;oon followed, the &s;ale, though not wholly &s;topped, was con&s;iderably checked; and the memoirs, for the time, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. But &s;carcely is the hand that wrote, and the tongue that dictated, yet cold in death, when, before it has been practicable even to examine and ar|range the numerous papers which that admi|rable man has left behind him, and which bear impre&s;&s;ed upon them the living traces of his great mind through his whole career of publick action, and during the previous cour&s;e of &s;evere &s;tudy, by which he prepared him|&s;elf to be what he became, a new notice is thrown forth, enlarged and improved a little in the language and arrangement, but in &s;ub|&s;tance nearly the &s;ame with the former. It clearly comes, it can only come, from the &s;ame quarter; though perhaps the work it|&s;elf may be coloured with &s;ome more o&s;ten|&s;ible name.</P>
<P>By this conduct, in addition to the turpi|tude which marked the former attempt, the
<PB N="3" REF="4">
will of the dead, regarded by all civilized na|tions with peculiar &s;anctity, is violated. The friends, to who&s;e care and judgment Mr. Burke confided the &s;election and u&s;e of his manu&s;cripts, are no longer at liberty to exer|ci&s;e their own di&s;cretion. They are not ma&s;|ters even of the time, order, and method to be ob&s;erved in the execution of their tru&s;t. Without a choice, they are dragged along to meet or to overtake the diver&s;ified arts of a man, who, fed by his bounty while alive, en|deavoured to di&s;quiet the la&s;t moments of his dying benefactor, and cea&s;es not to injure him in his grave. It is true, they have already obtained another injunction, but they are well aware, that crafty men will too often contrive to evade the law; de&s;perate men will dare to defy it. They know, indeed, from the for|mer experiment, that no deliberate encou|ragement will be given to the thefts and fa|brications of avarice or indigence: the new &s;y&s;tem of morals has not made quite &s;o much progre&s;s in this kingdom: but they al&s;o know that publick curio&s;ity, &s;trongly excited as it mu&s;t be, by a promi&s;e of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. Burke's &s;e|cret corre&s;pondence with the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="4" REF="5">
characters of Europe,"</Q> will demand to be indulged. It will &s;eek irregular, if it be denied regular means of gratification. The thir&s;t which is not permitted to drink of the fre&s;h fountain or the clear &s;tream, will &s;lake it&s;elf wherever it can, at the weedy pool or the muddy ditch.</P>
<P>Their determination therefore is taken. It is, upon the whole, they believe, the be&s;t which their circum&s;tances would allow; though they may be in &s;ome danger of thus furni&s;hing genuine materials, which are in their hands alone, and which mingled up with others of a different de&s;cription, may be employed to lend a fallacious credit to the idle tales of credulity and folly, or the ab&s;urd calumnies of enmity and envy.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent publication con&s;i&s;ts of three Memorials, which were written in the years 1791, 1792, 1793, and relate to three very intere&s;ting epochs in the French Revolution. They more particularly treat of the effects, which, at tho&s;e re&s;pective periods, the author imagined that event likely to produce on the
<PB N="5" REF="6">
political &s;tate of all Europe. There is rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that incorrect copies of two out of the three have been fraudulently taken.</P>
<P>Some other pieces are in the hands of the Printer, and will &s;hortly appear in a &s;econd pamphlet. They relate to the conduct of our two great parties at home, with a view to French politicks.</P>
<P>The&s;e two publications will fill up a very important cha&s;m in the recorded opinions of the Author. There is nothing on French af|fairs in the quarto edition of his works later than the middle of the year 1791; long before the fir&s;t approach to actual ho&s;tilities between the French and the neighbouring Powers of Germany. What he afterwards publi&s;hed takes up the &s;ubject at the point of time, when the King's Mini&s;ters, de&s;pairing of &s;uc|ce&s;s in the great purpo&s;e of continuing, what|ever was the immediate cau&s;e of beginning the war, had avowed a di&s;po&s;ition to nego|ciate a peace with the French Republick.</P>
<P>A collection al&s;o of Mr. Burke's more im|portant
<PB N="6" REF="7">
letters, during the la&s;t years of his life, e&s;pecially on the &s;ubject of France, is prepar|ing for the pre&s;s. Of cour&s;e it will be much more ample, than any thing which can be furni&s;hed by the per&s;on from who&s;e &s;canda|lous breach of tru&s;t alone any &s;purious com|pilation can draw it's materials.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e letters were intended, not for the pre&s;s indeed, but for free circulation in manu&s;cript; a channel, which through all the principal tran&s;actions of his political life, he u&s;ed in&s;tead of the publick prints, for explain|ing, as occa&s;ion required, his principles or his conduct. Of the&s;e compo&s;itions, &s;ometimes him&s;elf, and &s;ometimes tho&s;e around him kept copies.</P>
<P>Some few of his letters were pre&s;erved by him as a &s;ort of private prote&s;t and record of his opinions, when on que&s;tions of impor|tance he had the misfortune, (&s;uch he always &s;incerely felt it to be) of di&s;&s;enting from tho&s;e with whom he generally acted. He was, from conviction, a party-man; but he ever thought that party &s;hould be &s;ub&s;ervient to
<PB N="7" REF="8">
principle, not principle to party. His princi|ples are now, unhappily for his country and the world, become mere matter of hi&s;tory, and whatever can elucidate them is due to the in&s;truction of the publick.</P>
<P>His other letters, which pa&s;&s;ed in the un|re&s;erved freedom of confidential intercour&s;e, can only be obtained from the liberality of the friends to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed, many of whom have kindly promi&s;ed their contributions, and all of whom are re&s;pect|fully de&s;ired to tran&s;mit to Me&s;&s;rs. Riving|tons whatever they may have in that kind, which they may judge not unfit for the pub|lick eye. There is very little indeed of his corre&s;pondence (and no man wrote more) which does not contain &s;ome portion of a great body of ethicks and politicks, from which mankind may grow wi&s;er and better.</P>
<P>All the&s;e, and other &s;uch productions of his pen, as it may be thought right to print &s;epa|rately, will be given with all convenient &s;peed in the octavo &s;ize, which he him&s;elf in his life-time cho&s;e for the fir&s;t editions of his
<PB N="8" REF="9">
Speeches and Tracts. They will afterwards be formed, with many other original pieces of a le&s;s temporary nature, into quarto volumes; and to the whole will be prefixed a Life of the Author, accompanied with various letters and papers of a more early date, &s;ome of which were pointed out by him&s;elf as <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"do|cuments for the hi&s;tory, not of his own life," he ob&s;erved, "but of his times."</Q></P>
<P>It has been frequently &s;uppo&s;ed, that he was him&s;elf employed in writing &s;uch a hi&s;tory. But they who &s;uppo&s;ed this knew little of him. He bore too large a &s;hare, much be|yond what is commonly known, in the lite|rature and politicks of the age, to be him&s;elf the hi&s;torian. Though not without a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his own merits, he truly loved and practi&s;ed that humility, which he has &s;o beau|tifully called, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the low, but deep and firm foundation of all real virtue."</Q> On princi|ple, he would never have con&s;ented to under|take a ta&s;k, in performing which, to have done ju&s;tice to him&s;elf he mu&s;t have ri&s;ked the imputation of vanity; a vice which he abhorred to a degree, that by &s;uch as were
<PB N="9" REF="10">
not intimately acquainted with his heart, might have been &s;ometimes mi&s;taken for vanity it&s;elf. He has left in manu&s;cript &s;ome biographical &s;ketches both of his &s;on and his brother; none of him&s;elf. None are oftentatiou&s;ly in|troduced in any of his works. Cicero &s;eems to have written &s;ome of his books almo&s;t for the purpo&s;e of putting his own prai&s;es into the mouths of others, and of &s;cattering around tho&s;e numberle&s;s little intimations, which at this di&s;tance of time we gather up with &s;o much delight, of his childhood, his education, his &s;tudies, his amu&s;ements, his manners, his relations, his friends, his hou&s;es and plea&s;ure-grounds, the gallery of Tu&s;cu|lum, and the oak of Arpinum; but what|ever of that kind has fallen from Mr. Burke is only to be found incidentally inter&s;per&s;ed, where to have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it would have been to betray his own fair reputation, in which his family, friends, and country, had an in|tere&s;t as well as him&s;elf: it is to be found in his public or private an&s;wers to tho&s;e who had brought charges again&s;t him, and who were of a dignity to make a vindication of him&s;elf decorous, if not nece&s;&s;ary. The re&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="11">
mu&s;t be &s;upplied by the diligence and judg|ment of others, partly from memory and partly from information, which, it is hoped, all who in any part of his life have been in|timate with him will be &s;o obliging to com|municate; but principally from the different &s;ources already mentioned above, and the rich &s;tore of detached hints, loo&s;e notes, and un|fini&s;hed fragments which remain in his hand|writing, relative to all the more momentous bu&s;ine&s;s in which he was engaged. His pen was always in his hand. He &s;eldom thought or read without it.</P>
<P>In the mean time, &s;ome important parts of his conduct and character will receive light from this, and the &s;ucceeding publications. It will at once be &s;een, whether the &s;enti|ments recently expre&s;&s;ed by him were indeed the genuine conclu&s;ions of an early &s;agacity, anticipating calamities to come with a certainty that almo&s;t approached to in&s;pired prediction, or nothing more than the fal&s;e pretences of a tardy wi&s;dom too late in&s;tructed by the event.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
The&s;e papers will contain his inmo&s;t doc|trines. His countrymen have heard him in the Senate; they have read him in his deme|gorick writings de&s;igned for popular effect; they will now attend him, as it were, into the Cabinet.</P>
<P>The year 1791 was highly critical in the development of the French Revolution. Mr. Neckar and his colleagues had been driven with ignominy from their po&s;ts and the country. A new mini&s;try had been patched up from the accomplices and crea|tures of the original leaders in the National A&s;&s;embly. Tho&s;e leaders, to &s;ecure the power which they had obtained, &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition to put a &s;top to tho&s;e confu&s;ions, which they had them&s;elves excited or promoted. In their turn, they were them&s;elves attacked by a new &s;et of bolder, more ferocious, but more con|&s;i&s;tent demagogues. The Prie&s;ts were de|claredly per&s;ecuted; the Nobles plundered and hunted into emigration. Civil authority there was none. The army and navy were corrupted, and all di&s;cipline de&s;troyed. The King and Queen, after a &s;hort and in&s;ecure
<PB N="12" REF="13">
interval of comparative tranquillity, were again repeatedly in&s;ulted, and their lives open|ly endangered.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of things, Mr. Burke was of opinion, that our Amba&s;&s;ador ought not to be an idle &s;pectator of &s;uch &s;cenes at the Court of a Monarch, who was in effect a pri&s;oner; that he ought to be recalled, or to interpo&s;e the good-offices of our Court be|tween Louis the XVIth and his &s;editious &s;ub|jects, agreeably to our duty under the gene|ral law of nations, and the &s;pirit of our po&s;i|tive treaties. On this plan he drew up <Q REND="inline">"Hints for a Memorial to be delivered to M. Montmorin,"</Q> by Lord Gower.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e Hints were ever actually &s;een by the King's Mini&s;ters, there is no trace among his papers to &s;hew, neither can tho&s;e friends, from whom he was accu&s;tomed to conceal nothing, undertake to &s;ay from their recollection. It is probable, that they were not &s;een, as at that period he had no direct intercour&s;e with Government, and events &s;oon en&s;ued in France, which left no room
<PB N="13" REF="14">
for &s;uch a mediation. The paper, however, will be printed at the end of this Preface: it was di&s;covered too late to be in&s;erted, where it ought to have &s;tood in the body of this publication. It will bear a &s;trong, but not the only, te&s;timony to the Author's real prac|tical views, which have been &s;o malignantly mi&s;repre&s;ented, with regard to the French Revolution. However much he di&s;approved and contemned the fal&s;e and treacherous prin|ciples, &s;ince renounced even by them&s;elves, in which it glorified it&s;elf at it's out&s;et; how|ever early he warned his own country of their pernicious tendency, and the &s;teady and uniform march of their operation to break down a flouri&s;hing Monarchy into a hideous barba|ri&s;m; however feelingly his nature dete&s;ted the cruelties and atrocities of all kinds, with which their progre&s;s was &s;y&s;tematically ac|companied, for the purpo&s;e of cru&s;hing all oppo&s;ition under the dominion of terrour; yet while there appeared to him a chance of any quiet termination to the&s;e mi&s;eries and horrours, his coun&s;els were moderate, conci|liatory, and healing. The very ba&s;is of any agreement which the King of Great Britain,
<PB N="14" REF="15">
as the King of a people <Q REND="inline">"<HI>perfectly and &s;olidly, becau&s;e &s;oberly, rationally and legally</HI> free,"</Q> could undertake to negociate, was to be the &s;ettlement, and, if required, the guarantee of a free con&s;titution in France, but under an efficient Monarchy; both their government and their freedom being e&s;tabli&s;hed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"upon principles of moderation, as the only means of &s;ecuring permanence to both the&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings, as well as internal and external tran|quillity to the kingdom of France, and to all Europe"</Q> It will hereafter appear from his letters that, at a later period in the &s;ame year, he held a very &s;imilar language to the exiled French Princes and their agents, when they were preparing to a&s;&s;ert their rights by the &s;word. We mu&s;t now pa&s;s to the three Memorials, which form the immediate con|tents of this pamphlet.</P>
<P>The King of France in the April of that year was prevented by the populace, with every kind of menace and outrage, from going to his Palace at St. Cloud. He complained to the National A&s;&s;embly. The re&s;ult was that he was compelled to &s;anction a circular
<PB N="15" REF="16">
letter, which was &s;oon after &s;ent by M. Montmorin to all foreign Courts, announcing the new Con&s;titution of France, it's nature, and principles. This was followed by new indignities and encrea&s;ed licentiou&s;ne&s;s, by the flight to Montmedi, the actual cu&s;tody of the Royal Family, the mockery of revi&s;ing the Con&s;titution, and the final acceptance of it by the King, which was notified in another cir|cular letter from M. Montmorin. By the&s;e two official communications, unprecedented in diplomacy, the right of con&s;idering the in|ternal Con&s;titution of France was not only given to other States, if they had no &s;uch right before, but their attention was directly called to the &s;ubject. Nor was the purpo&s;e of the communications concealed. It was profe&s;&s;edly to lead to &s;imilar Revolutions in other countries. When the fir&s;t of the&s;e ex|traordinary di&s;patches was originally &s;ubmit|ted to the A&s;&s;embly, long before any concert of Princes again&s;t France, it was enthu&s;ia&s;ti|cally applauded as <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a &s;plendid example of a great King proclaiming afar the liberty of all people."</Q> It was, in fact, a general defi|ance to all the old Governments of Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">
Mr. Burke had particular means of know|ing the di&s;po&s;itions of the continental Powers. His &s;on during that &s;ummer was at Coblentz, though not at the expence, nor with the for|mal authority, yet with the knowledge and approbation of Government. He was early convinced that the Declaration &s;igned at Pil|nitz by the Emperor and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was in a manner extorted by the Count d'Ar|tois, and was never de&s;igned to be carried into &s;erious effect. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia refu&s;ed to &s;tir, till the Emperor &s;hould have put him|&s;elf in motion: and the Emperor he&s;itated to move from a real or pretended di&s;tru&s;t of this country. In general, the neighbouring Potentates &s;eemed for a long time blind to the peril of their &s;ituation, and when the au|dacity of Bri&s;&s;ot's faction, as &s;oon as he had e&s;tabli&s;hed his a&s;cendency in the &s;econd A&s;|&s;embly, made them reluctantly open their eyes, they were &s;truck with a &s;udden dread, from which they &s;ought refuge in &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>At home Mr. Burke found as little agree|ment with his views. Tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">ers of
<PB N="17" REF="18">
Oppo&s;ition, who in reality did not differ much from him, naturally wi&s;hed to avoid as long as they could, any que&s;tion that might preci|pitate a direct breach with &s;ome others of the &s;ame party, who from a long connexion &s;tood high in their confidence, and were dear to their affections. Between Mini&s;ters and him|&s;elf he believed there was a more e&s;&s;ential difference. He under&s;tood them to think (as he afterwards told one of them) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the new principles might be encouraged; that they might triumph over every interior and exterior re&s;i&s;tance, and even overturn other States, as they had that of France, without any &s;ort of hazard, that they would extend in their con&s;equences to this kingdom."</Q> His own opinion thus early was, that there never exi&s;ted a cri&s;is &s;o important to the world; that the power of France, which the preced|ing year had &s;een in a manner annihilated by her internal anarchy, now appeared more for|midable than ever; that all hope of a quiet &s;ettlement to the di&s;orders of that di&s;tracted country was gone; that the more furious part of the Jacobin faction, who from the fir&s;t had been eager to di&s;turb the peace of all
<PB N="18" REF="19">
Europe, was daily encrea&s;ing in &s;trength and &s;olidity; and as France had not then re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed her army after it's di&s;&s;olution by de|crees and intrigues, while the northern powers had not yet begun to di&s;band their forces after the Turki&s;h war, that every thing was to be gained to the former, every thing lo&s;t to the latter by delay.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions he wrote the Me|morial of December 1791. It was &s;ent to &s;ome of the leaders of Oppo&s;ition, and to the Mini|&s;ters, by one of whom it was communicated to the King. The &s;tyle and the topicks are tho&s;e of a &s;tate&s;man addre&s;&s;ing &s;tate&s;men. It takes it's ri&s;e from M. Montmorin's two letters. It points out the features and character which di&s;tingui&s;h this Revolution from mo&s;t others of ancient or modern times: it delineates with a ma&s;terly hand the political map of Europe, and marks with wonderful preci&s;ion the track which the new principles were likely to pur&s;ue in their progre&s;s: it combats the &s;uppo&s;ition that the Revolution would fall by it's own weak|ne&s;s, by internal force, or the di&s;credit of it's paper money: it con&s;iders the di&s;po|&s;itions
<PB N="19" REF="20">
of the neighbouring powers, who were mo&s;t intere&s;ted in &s;topping the cour&s;e of the mi&s;chief, and the general leaning of all Kings, Amba&s;&s;adors, and Mini&s;ters of State in the&s;e days; but it mode&s;tly profe&s;&s;es only to make a ca&s;e without offering advice, to &s;hew the nature of the evil, without &s;ugge&s;t|ing a remedy. His country, the world, and po&s;terity, will now be able to judge how far his &s;peculations on this great que&s;tion of poli|ticks were ju&s;t: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the paper," he conceived at the time, "did not meet the ideas of Mi|ni&s;ters."</Q></P>
<P>The inva&s;ion of France by the Duke of Brun&s;wick in 1792, after the French had declared war, and been repul&s;ed in an attack on the Netherlands, excited the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of many. Mr. Burke, it is known to tho&s;e who conver&s;ed with him, and will ap|pear by &s;ome of his letters, always di&s;tru&s;ted the event. Be&s;ides the incalculable difference which time had made, he &s;aw a radical error in not giving more importance and lead to the exiled Princes and Nobility of France. He had from the fir&s;t a &s;ettled conviction that neither
<PB N="20" REF="21">
in&s;urrections of the Royali&s;ts within, nor a foreign force from without, could &s;eparately avail. There was no &s;ound hope, in his judg|ment, but from a well-combined, and cordial co-operation of both. On the di&s;a&s;trous and ig|nominious retreat of the Duke of Brun&s;wick, he ha&s;tily threw down his thoughts in an unformal manner, and &s;ubmitted them to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e who had &s;een the for|mer paper. He now proceeded further, and intimated in general terms, what he thought &s;hould be done for the &s;afety of Europe. Upon all maxims of ancient policy, upon all views of the actual circum&s;tances, he was decided in his opinion, that England &s;hould interpo&s;e as the protectre&s;s of the balance of power. It was e&s;&s;ential, he thought, that &s;he &s;hould be the pre&s;iding &s;oul of that concert, which &s;eemed to be now indi&s;pen&s;able; that &s;he &s;hould govern it's coun&s;els, and direct it's efforts; &s;he &s;hould negociate and confederate, exhort on one &s;ide, and remon&s;trate on the other; &s;he &s;hould not precipitate a war, but ri&s;k it, and firmly meet it, for the &s;afety of Europe. But before this paper had been com|municated to tho&s;e for who&s;e u&s;e it was in|tended,
<PB N="21" REF="22">
the French Convention ventured on decrees and acts directly &s;triking at this coun|try, and her old ally Holland. A &s;ort of un|official negociation en&s;ued, which ended in a declaration of war by the French Republick again&s;t Great Britain and Holland. Thus forced &s;eparately into open ho&s;tility, Mini&s;ters were under the nece&s;&s;ity of joining the Powers already in arms, on their own conditions. They could not take that lead which, Mr. Burke believed, might have been conceded to them as the price of their voluntary interpo|&s;ition.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es of 1793, Mr. Burke was cur&s;orily informed in a conver&s;ation with one of the King's Mini&s;ters, that they pur|po&s;ed to i&s;&s;ue a declaration of the motives, objects, and end of the war. Sometime in the &s;ub&s;equent autumn, he heard again of the &s;ame de&s;ign. He doubted the prudence and expediency of the mea&s;ure, e&s;pecially at that time, ju&s;t after our retreat from Dunkirk. He &s;ought, but was not able to obtain, a con|ference on the &s;ubject.</P>

He had recour&s;e, therefore, to his pen. This was the origin of the third memorial. Accordingly at the head of one of the co|pies found in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it was called, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thoughts re&s;pectfully &s;ubmitted on the propo&s;ed Manife&s;to;"</Q> though it was en|dor&s;ed with the pre&s;ent title. He had not, however, proceeded far before he learnt that the Declaration was to be immediately i&s;&s;ued. He de&s;ired it might be delayed a &s;ingle day, that he might have an opportunity of previ|ou&s;ly &s;tating his doubts; but was told that no alteration could be admitted, as the paper had been approved by the allied Courts.</P>
<P>The Memorial in con&s;equence lay for &s;ome time unfini&s;hed. But &s;ome agents of the Royali&s;ts of Britanny and Poitou having about that period prevailed on Mr. Burke to &s;econd their repre&s;entations to Government with his influence, and the &s;urrender of Toulon having made an opening in their favour, he re|&s;umed what he had laid a&s;ide, and completed it upon a more comprehen&s;ive plan. It &s;eems in it's &s;tyle and &s;pirit to approach more near|ly,
<PB N="23" REF="24">
than either of the other two Memorials, to the animation and deci&s;ion of his own former publications. It begins by &s;tating the time to be that of calamity and defeat. When it proceeds to the main con&s;ideration, it paints with a firm but rapid pencil the mi&s;erable &s;ituation of France under the reign of Rober&s;|pierre and terrour, the full effects of which Mr. Burke confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf not to have fore|&s;een. The whole nation was divided into the oppre&s;&s;ors and the oppre&s;&s;ed. He then argues that the very &s;ucce&s;s of the Allies on their own plan would not re&s;tore France to a condition &s;afe for her&s;elf and for Europe, and he ultimately ventures to give his own ad|vice. Perhaps, if there is any pa&s;&s;age in it more e&s;pecially de&s;erving of attention than another, it is the noble &s;cheme of awful, but di&s;criminating ju&s;tice, tempered with enlight|ened mercy, which he recommends and en|forces, in the event of the Monarchy, and ancient orders of the State being once more re&s;tored in France. The Memorial concludes with an emphatick prote&s;t again&s;t what he al|ways con&s;idered as the great, fruitful &s;ource
<PB N="24" REF="25">
of every mi&s;carriage, the great leading mi&s;|take, that of conducting the war, by prece|dent, as a common war again&s;t a common enemy, for the u&s;ual objects of ordinary ap|peals to arms, and &s;earching hi&s;tory for le&s;|&s;ons of civil prudence, to be derived from former Revolutions, which re&s;embled this portent of our times in nothing but the name.</P>
<P>In every one of the&s;e three Memorials reference is made to the writers on the law of nations; and in one or two places Vattel is expre&s;sly named. It has been thought pro|per, therefore, to &s;ubjoin an Appendix, con|&s;i&s;ting of pa&s;&s;ages from that eminent publici&s;t, which were found among Mr. Burke's pa|pers, drawn out for his private u&s;e under di&s;|tinct heads, as they are here printed, and il|lu&s;trated in his hand-writing with marginal comments and &s;hort notes, which are here pre&s;erved. Some few notes have been added to complete his plan. Even the&s;e are not wholly without his authority. They are the faint ve&s;tiges of much di&s;cour&s;e had with him at different times on the effect and application
<PB N="25" REF="26">
of the extracts. A genius like his, rich in &s;o much natural and acquired wealth, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been confident in it&s;elf. Yet this was the laborious and accurate method which to the end of his life he was habitu|ated to pur&s;ue, in collecting and dige&s;ting the be&s;t information upon every &s;ubject that oc|cupied his mind; working upon all, and ever mingling up with it &s;omething of his own.</P>
<P>In explaining and connecting the hi&s;tory of the three Memorials, nothing, it is hoped, has been &s;aid, which can be con&s;trued to im|ply a cen&s;ure on tho&s;e who direct the affairs of this kingdom. They may have formed to them&s;elves a wi&s;er &s;y&s;tem of action, and been defeated in it by accidents, which could nei|ther be fore&s;een nor controuled; they may have unwillingly compromi&s;ed in their coun|&s;els with the irre&s;i&s;tible force of circum|&s;tances, and been compelled to adopt a &s;y&s;tem which they knew to be imperfect; they may even, by attempting le&s;s, have actually done more. The&s;e are que&s;tions too exten&s;ive and important for this place. All that it &s;eems
<PB N="26" REF="27">
proper to &s;ay here, is &s;imply, that whatever may have been their &s;y&s;tem, and the merits of that &s;y&s;tem, it was not that of Mr. Burke. And thus much is due to his memory, and to truth. Whatever has been the failure of the war, it is in no manner to be a&s;cribed to him: the time and mode of beginning it were not his choice: the plan of operations for con|ducting it was not his &s;ugge&s;tion: and the declaration of principles, on which it has been ju&s;tified, was not made by his advice, nor with his concurrence. Neither did he flatter tho&s;e in power by a &s;ilent acquie&s;cence in a cour&s;e of policy which he did not ap|prove. According to his practice, in more in|&s;tances than one, during his oppo&s;ition to Lord North's Admini&s;tration, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he cho&s;e ra|ther," as he has &s;aid, "re&s;pectfully to &s;tate a doubt to Mini&s;ters whil&s;t a mea&s;ure was depending, than to reproach them after|wards with it's con&s;equences."</Q></P>
<P>In truth, he who never u&s;ed any &s;olicita|tion to advance his own per&s;onal intere&s;ts, was indefatigable in &s;oliciting &s;upport to that
<PB N="27" REF="28">
cau&s;e, which he con&s;idered as the common intere&s;t of mankind. There was no per&s;on of rank or eminence in Europe with whom he had any occa&s;ion of corre&s;pondence, that he did not endeavour to conciliate, confirm, or animate on the &s;ide of religion, morals, and &s;ocial order, connected with moderated liberty. He applied to each the &s;everal to|picks which were be&s;t &s;uited to his circum|&s;tances, his condition, his prejudices, or his wants, but all centered in one point. If to the people he again and again recommended, and inculcated, and enforced, with all the varied beauty and energy of his fa&s;cinating elo|quence, a principle of obedience, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and re&s;pect to their lawful Rulers of every denomination; to Princes and to all men in the exerci&s;e of authority he did not &s;pare to recount, in the calmer tone of more argu|mentative di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the faults and errors to which their &s;tations render them peculiarly liable, to impre&s;s upon them the nece&s;&s;ity of that union between Mercy and Ju&s;tice, without which one degenerates into weakne&s;s, and the other into cruelty; and to admoni&s;h

them, for their own tranquillity and happi|ne&s;s, to protect, not oppre&s;s, their people, to improve, not impair, the legal &s;ecurity of the &s;ubject in his per&s;on and property, according to the true nature of their re&s;pective govern|ments, for the great end of all government. Founding, as he always did, his political on his moral philo&s;ophy, he told the different cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, not of their extreme rights, but of their duties, the root of which is in the rights of others. He ardently loved his country and wi&s;hed her pro&s;perity: yet he has not &s;crupled to &s;ay, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he dreaded our own power and our own ambition; he dreaded our being too much dreaded."</Q> He con&s;tantly pro&s;e&s;&s;ed a jealou&s;y of France as the natural rival and enemy of England; yet he was not le&s;s alarmed at her weakne&s;s, when, in the moment of the Monarchy being di&s;&s;olved, &s;he &s;eemed to leave a cha&s;m in the map of Europe, than afterwards at her terrific power, when the mon&s;trous republic of Bri&s;|&s;ot and Rober&s;pierre grew too big for her an|cient limits; nor was he without his fears of her being again reduced too low, if the Allies
<PB N="29" REF="30">
had &s;ucceeded in what he believed to be their &s;y&s;tem of di&s;membering her. In general, men &s;ee that &s;ide only, which is neare&s;t to them, in the order of things, by which they are &s;urrounded, and in which they are carried along; but the clear and penetrating &s;ight of his mind comprehended in one view all the parts of the immen&s;e whole, which varying from moment to moment, yet continuing through centuries e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame, ex|tends around and above to every civilized peo|ple in every age, and unites and incorporates the pre&s;ent with the generations which are pa&s;t. To pre&s;erve that whole unbroken to a late po&s;terity, he knew no other way than by re&s;i&s;ting all mad or wicked attempts to de|&s;troy any of the great prominent parts. Not that he was the enemy of re&s;ormations. Quite the rever&s;e. But he would allow the honour of that name to no changes which affected the very &s;ub&s;tance of the thing: tho&s;e he approved, tho&s;e he called true reforma|tions, which patiently &s;eeking the degree of perfection alone attainable by man, and or|dained to be only the &s;low re&s;ult of long ex|perience
<PB N="30" REF="31">
and much meditation, put the hap|pine&s;s of none to the hazard, while they bet|ter the condition of all. If, like the early &s;ages of Greece, he were to be characterized by &s;ome peculiar &s;entiment, it &s;hould be that to which he de&s;ired to give the currency of a proverb&mdash;<HI>to innovate is not to reform.</HI></P>
<P>This Preface has been drawn by degrees into an unexpected length. Much of Mr. Burke's character may have been here antici|pated, which might have come with more propriety and force, hereafter. But on the &s;pot where every object, to which the eye can be directed, is full of his image, it was impo&s;&s;ible that many little remembrances of his opinions and habits, which mu&s;t involun|tarily ari&s;e in the bo&s;om, &s;hould not run over on the paper. They will not be the lea&s;t in|tere&s;ting part to tho&s;e who enjoyed the ble&s;|&s;ing of an intimacy with him; and when the name of a decea&s;ed friend has been already forged to a de&s;picable libel again&s;t him, when intelligence has been received, even while this Preface has been pa&s;&s;ing under the pre&s;s,

of new artifices, which have been practi&s;ed through the country, to &s;olicit a party-&s;up|port to an in&s;idious attack upon his fame, that &s;ome correct notion of &s;uch a man &s;hould be early given, &s;eemed to be of moment to the cau&s;e of public virtue.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">[WRITTEN IN THE EARLY PART OF 1791.]</HEAD>
<P>THE King my Ma&s;ter, from his &s;incere de&s;ire of keeping up a good corre&s;pondence with his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, and the French na|tion, has for &s;ome time beheld with concern, the condition into which that &s;overeign and nation have fallen.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the reality and the warmth of tho&s;e &s;entiments, his Britannick Maje&s;ty has hither|to forborne in any manner to take a part in their affairs; in hopes, that the common intere&s;t of King and &s;ubjects would render all parties &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ettling, their government and their freedom, upon principles of moderation; as the only means of &s;ecuring permanence to both

the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, as well as internal and external tranquillity, to the Kingdom of France, and to all Europe.</P>
<P>His Britannick Maje&s;ty finds, to his great re|gret, that his hopes have not been realized. He finds, that confu&s;ions and di&s;orders have rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed, and that they now threaten to proceed to dangerous extremities.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of things, the &s;ame regard to a neighbouring Sovereign living in friend&s;hip with Great Britain, the &s;ame &s;pirit of good-will to the Kingdom of France, the &s;ame regard to the gene|ral tranquillity, which have cau&s;ed him to view with concern, the growth and continuance of the pre&s;ent di&s;orders, have induced the King of Great Britain to interpo&s;e his good offices towards a re|concilement of tho&s;e unhappy differences. This his Maje&s;ty does with the mo&s;t cordial regard to the good of all de&s;criptions concerned, and with the mo&s;t perfect &s;incerity, wholly removing from his Royal mind, all memory of every circum&s;tance which might impede him in the execution of a plan of benevolence which he has &s;o much at heart.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, having always thought it his great|e&s;t glory, that he rules over a people, perfectly

and &s;olidly, becau&s;e &s;oberly, rationally, and legally free, can never be &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed in offering thus his Royal mediation, but with an unaffected de&s;ire and full re&s;olution, to con&s;ider the &s;ettlement of a free con&s;titution in France, as the very ba&s;is of any agreement between the Sovereign and tho&s;e of his &s;ubjects who are unhappily at variance with him; to guarantee it to them, if it &s;hould be de|&s;ired, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and authentick manner, and to do all that in him lies to procure the like guarantee from other powers.</P>
<P>His Britannick Maje&s;ty, in the &s;ame manner, a&s;&s;ures the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, that he knows too well, and values too highly, what is due to the dignity and rights of crowned Heads, and to the implied faith of treaties which have always been made with the <HI>Crown</HI> of France, ever to li&s;ten to any propo&s;ition by which that Monarchy &s;hall be de&s;poiled of all its rights, &s;o e&s;&s;ential for the &s;up|port of the con&s;ideration of the Prince, and the concord and welfare of the people.</P>
<P>If unfortunately, a due attention &s;hould not be paid to the&s;e his Maje&s;ty's benevolent and neigh|bourly offers, or, if any circum&s;tances &s;hould pre|vent the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King from acceding, (as his Maje&s;ty has no doubt he is well di&s;po&s;ed to do) to this healing mediation in favour of him&s;elf and

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON FRENCH AFFAIRS, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WRITTEN IN DECEMBER, 1791.</HEAD>
<P>IN all our tran&s;actions with France, and at all periods, we have treated with that State on the footing of a Monarchy. Monarchy was con&s;idered in all the external relations of that kingdom with every Power in Europe as it's legal and con&s;titu|tional Government, and that in which alone it's federal capacity was ve&s;ted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Montmo|rin's Letter.</NOTE>It is not yet a year &s;ince Mon&s;ieur de Mont|morin, formally, and with as little re&s;pect as can be imagined, to the King, and to all crowned heads, announced a total revolution in that coun|try. He has informed the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try that it's frame of Government is wholly altered; that he is one of the Mini&s;ters of the new &s;y&s;tem; and in ef|fect, that the King is no longer his ma&s;ter (nor does he even call him &s;uch) but the <Q REND="inline">"<HI>fir&s;t of the Mini&s;ters</HI>"</Q> in the new &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="38">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acceptance of the Con|&s;titution ra|tified.</NOTE>The &s;econd notification was that of the King's acceptance of the new Con&s;titution; accompanied with fanfaronades in the modern &s;tyle of the French bureaus, things which have much more the air and character of the &s;aucy declamations of their clubs, than the tone of regular office.</P>
<P>It has not been very u&s;ual to notify to foreign Courts, any thing concerning the internal arrange|ments of any State. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the cir|cum&s;tance of the&s;e two notifications, with the ob+&s;ervations with which they are attended, does not leave it in the choice of the Sovereigns of Chri&s;|tendom to appear ignorant either of this French Revolution, or (what is more important) of it's principles.</P>
<P>We know that very &s;oon after this Manife&s;to of Mon&s;ieur de Montmorin, the King of France, in who&s;e name it was made, found him&s;elf obliged to fly, with his whole family: leaving behind him a Declaration, in which he di&s;avows and annuls that Con&s;titution, as having been the effect of force on his per&s;on and u&s;urpation on his authority. It is equally notorious that this unfortunate Prince was with many circum&s;tances of in&s;ult and outrage brought back pri&s;oner, by a deputation of the pre|tended National A&s;&s;embly, and afterwards &s;u&s;pend|ed by their authority, from his Government. Un|der <PB N="3" REF="39">
equally notorious con&s;traint, and under me|naces of total depo&s;ition, he has been compelled to accept what they call a Con&s;titution, and to agree to whatever el&s;e the u&s;urped power which holds him in con&s;inement, thinks proper to impo&s;e.</P>
<P>His next brother, who had fled with him, and his third brother, who had fled before him, all the Princes of his blood, who remained faithful to him, and the flower of his Magi&s;tracy, his Clergy, and his Nobility, continue in foreign countries, pro|te&s;ting again&s;t all acts done by him in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, on the grounds upon which he had him|&s;elf prote&s;ted again&s;t them at the time of his flight; with this addition, that they deny his very com|petence, (as on good grounds they may) to abro|gate the Royalty, or the ancient con&s;titutional Orders of the Kingdom. In this prote&s;t they are joined by three hundred of the late A&s;&s;embly it|&s;elf, and in effect, by a great part of the French Nation. The new Government (&s;o far as the people dare to di&s;clo&s;e their &s;entiments) is di&s;dain|ed, I am per&s;uaded, by the greater number; who as M. de la Fayette complains, and as the truth is, have declined to take any &s;hare in the new elec|tions to the National A&s;&s;embly, either as candi|dates or electors.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="40">
In this &s;tate of things (that is in the ca&s;e of a <HI>divided</HI> kingdom) by <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vattel, b. ii. c. 4. &s;ect. 56. and b. iii. c 18. &s;ect. 296.</NOTE>the law of nations, Great Britain, like every other Power, is free to take any part &s;he plea&s;es. She may decline, with more or le&s;s formality, according to her di&s;cretion, to ac|knowledge this new &s;y&s;tem; or &s;he may recognize it as a Covernment <HI>de facto,</HI> &s;etting a&s;ide all di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of it's original legality, and con&s;idering the ancient Monarchy as at an end. The law of na|tions leaves our Court open to it's choice. We have no direction but what is found in the well|under&s;tood policy of the King and kingdom.</P>
<P>This Declaration of a <HI>new &s;pecies</HI> of Government, on new principles (&s;uch it profe&s;&s;es it&s;elf to be) is a real cri&s;is in the politicks of Europe. The con|duct which prudence ought to dietate to Great-Britain, will not depend (as hitherto our connexion or quarrel with other States has for &s;ome time de|pended) upon merely <HI>external</HI> relations; but, in a great mea&s;ure al&s;o upon the &s;y&s;tem which we may think it right to adopt for the internal government of our own country.</P>
<P>If it be our policy to a&s;&s;imilate our Govern|ment to that of France, we ought to prepare for this change, by encouraging the &s;chemes of au|thority e&s;tabli&s;hed there. We ought to wink at
<PB N="5" REF="41">
the captivity and depo&s;ition of a Prince, with whom, if not in clo&s;e alliance, we were in friend|&s;hip. We ought to fall in with the ideas of Mon&s;. Montmorin's circular Manife&s;to; and to do bu&s;i|ne&s;s of cour&s;e with the functionaries who act under the new power, by which that King to whom his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ter has been &s;ent to re&s;ide, has been depo&s;ed and impri&s;oned. On that idea we ought al&s;o to with-hold all &s;orts of direct or indirect countenance from tho&s;e who are treating in Ger|many for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the French Mo|narchy and the ancient Orders of that State. This conduct is &s;uitable to this policy.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is, whether this policy be &s;uitable to the intere&s;ts of the Crown and &s;ubjects of Great Britain. Let us therefore a little con&s;ider the true nature and probable effects of the Revolution which, in &s;uch a very unu&s;ual manner, has been twice diplomatically announced to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference between this Revolution and others.</NOTE>There have been many internal revolutions in the Government of countries, both as to per&s;ons and forms, in which the neighbouring States have had little or no concern. Whatever the Govern|ment might be with re&s;pect to tho&s;e per&s;ons and tho&s;e forms, the &s;tationary intere&s;ts of the nation concerned, have mo&s;t commonly influenced the new Governments in the &s;ame manner in which
<PB N="6" REF="42">
they influenced the old; and the Revolution, turning on matter of local grievance or of local accommodation, did not extend beyond it's ter|ritory.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the French Revolution.</NOTE>The pre&s;ent Revolution in France &s;eems to me to be quite of another character and de&s;cription; and to bear little re&s;emblance or analogy to any of tho&s;e which have been brought about in Europe, upon principles merely political. <HI>It is a Revolu|tion of doctrine and theoretick dogma.</HI> It has a much greater re&s;emblance to tho&s;e changes which have been made upon religious grounds, in which a &s;pi|rit of pro&s;elyti&s;m makes an e&s;&s;ential part.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Revolution of doctrine and theory which has happened in Europe, is the Reformation. It is not for my purpo&s;e to take any notice here of the merits of that Revolution, but to &s;tate one only of it's effects.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">It's effects.</NOTE>That effect was <HI>to introduce other intere&s;ts into all countries, than tho&s;e which aro&s;e from their loca|lity and natural circum&s;tances.</HI> The principle of the Reformation was &s;uch, as by it's e&s;&s;ence, could not be local or confined to the country in which it had it's origin. For in&s;tance, the doctrine of <Q REND="inline">"Ju&s;ti|fication by Faith or by Works,"</Q> which was the ori|ginal ba&s;is of the Reformation, could not have one
<PB N="7" REF="43">
of it's alternatives true as to Germany, and fal&s;e as to every other country. Neither are que&s;tions of theoretick truth and fal&s;ehood governed by cir|cum&s;tances any more than by places. On that occa&s;ion, therefore, the &s;pirit of pro&s;elyti&s;m ex|panded it&s;elf with great ela&s;ticity upon all &s;ides; and great divi&s;ions were every where the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>The&s;e divi&s;ions however, in appearance merely dogmatick, &s;oon became mixed with the political; and their effects were rendered much more inten&s;e from this combination. Europe was for a long time divided into two great factions, under the name of Catholick and Prote&s;tant, which not only often alienated State from State, but al&s;o divided almo&s;t every State within it&s;elf. The warm parties in each State were more affectionately attached to tho&s;e of their own doctrinal intere&s;t in &s;ome other country than to their fellow citizens, or to their natural Government, when they or either of them happened to be of a different per&s;ua&s;ion. The&s;e factions, wherever they prevailed, if they did not ab&s;elutely de&s;troy, at lea&s;t weakened and di&s;tracted the locality of patrioti&s;m. The publick affections came to have other motives and other ties.</P>
<P>It would be to repeat the hi&s;tory of the two la&s;t centuries to exemplify the effects of this Revo|lution.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="44">
Although the principles to which it gave ri&s;e, did not operate with a perfect regularity and con|&s;tancy, they never wholly cea&s;ed to operate. Few wars were made, and few treaties were entered into in which they did not come in for &s;ome part. They gave a colour, a character, and direction to all the politicks of Europe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New &s;y&s;tem of Politicks.</NOTE>The&s;e principles of internal, as well as external divi&s;ion and coalition, are but ju&s;t now extin|gui&s;hed. But they who will examine into the true character and genius of &s;ome late events, mu&s;t be &s;atisfied that other &s;ources of faction, combining parties among the inhabitants of different coun|tries into one connexion, are opened, and that from the&s;e &s;ources are likely to ari&s;e effects full as important as tho&s;e which had formerly ari&s;en from the jarring intere&s;ts of the religious &s;ects. The intention of the &s;everal actors in the change in France, is not a matter of doubt. It is very openly pro&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the modern world, before this time, there has been no in&s;tance of this &s;pirit of general political faction, &s;eparated from religion, pervading &s;everal countries, and forming a principle of union be|tween the partizans in each.

The&s;e ancient factions in each com|monwealth of Greece, connected them&s;elves with tho&s;e of the &s;ame de&s;cription in &s;ome other States; and &s;ecret cabals and publick alliances were carried on and made, not upon a conformity of general po|litical intere&s;ts, but for the &s;upport and aggran|dizement of the two leading States which headed the Ari&s;tocratick and Democratick Factions. For, as in later times, the King of Spain was at the head of a Catholick, and the King of Sweden of a Prote&s;|tant intere&s;t, France, (though Catholick, acting &s;ub|ordinately to the latter,) in the like manner the Lacedemonians were every where at the head of the Ari&s;tocratick intere&s;ts, and the Athenians of the Democratick. The two leading Powers kept alive a con&s;tant cabal and con&s;piracy in every State, and the political dogmas concerning the con&s;titu|tion of a Republick, were the great in&s;truments by which the&s;e leading States cho&s;e to aggrandize them&s;elves.

<P>I might further exemplify the po&s;&s;ibility of a political &s;entiment running through various &s;tates and combining factions in them, from the hi&s;tory of the middle ages in the Guelfs and Ghibellines.

They became no more than names to di&s;tingui&s;h factions; but they were not the le&s;s powerful in their operation, when they had no direct point of doctrine, either religious or civil, to a&s;&s;ert. For a long time, how|ever, tho&s;e factions gave no &s;mall degree of influ|ence to the foreign Chiefs in every commonwealth in which they exi&s;ted.

The aggregation to France of the Democratick Swi&s;s Republicks appears to them to be a work half done by their very form; and it might &s;eem to them rather an encrea&s;e of impor|tance to the&s;e little Commonwealths, than a dero|gation from their independency, or a change in the manner of their Government. Upon any quarrel among&s;t the Cantons nothing is more like|ly than &s;uch an event. As to the Ari&s;tocratick Re|publicks, the general clamour and hatred which the French excite again&s;t the very name, (and with more facility and &s;ucce&s;s than again&s;t Monarchs) and the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of their Government making any &s;ort of re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t an in&s;urrec|tion, where they have no troops, and the people are all armed and trained, render their hopes in that quarter, far indeed from unfounded. It is certain that the Republick of Berne thinks it&s;elf obliged to a vigilance next to ho&s;tile, and to impri|&s;on or expel all the French whom they find in their territories. But indeed tho&s;e Ari&s;tocracies which comprehend whatever is con&s;iderable, wealthy, and valuable in Switzerland, do now &s;o wholly depend

upon opinion, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Old French maxims the &s;ecurity of its indepen|dence.</NOTE> and the humour of their multitude, that the lighte&s;t puff of wind is &s;ufficient to blow them down. If France, under it's antient regimen, and upon the antient principles of policy, was the &s;upport of the Germanick Con&s;titution, it was much more &s;o of that of Switzerland, which al|mo&s;t from the very origin of that con&s;ederacy re&s;t|ed upon the clo&s;ene&s;s of it's connexion with France, on which the Swi&s;s Cantons wholly re|po&s;ed them&s;elves for the pre&s;ervation of the parts of their body in their re&s;pective rights and perma|nent forms, as well as for the maintenance of all in their general independency.</P>
<P>Switzerland and Germany are the fir&s;t objects of the new French politicians. When I contem|plate what they have done at home, which is in effect little le&s;s than an amazing conque&s;t wrought by a change of opinion, in a great part (to be &s;ure far from altogether) very &s;udden, I cannot help letting my thoughts run along with their de&s;igns, and without attending to geographical order, to con&s;ider the other States of Europe &s;o far as they may be any way affected by this a&s;toni&s;hing Re|volution. If early &s;teps are not taken in &s;ome way or other to prevent the &s;preading of this influence, I &s;carcely think any of them perfectly &s;ecure.</P>

This much is certain, that the Roman people, if once the blind reverence they bear to the &s;anctity of the Pope, which is their only bridle, &s;hould relax, are naturally tur|bulent, &s;erocious, and headlong, whil&s;t the police is defective, and the Government feeble and re|&s;ourcele&s;s beyond all imagination.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spain.</NOTE>As to Spain, it is a nervele&s;s country. It does not po&s;&s;e&s;s the u&s;e, it only &s;uffers the abu&s;e of a nobility. For &s;ome time, and even before the &s;et|tlement of the Bourbon Dyna&s;ty, that body has been &s;y&s;tematically lowered, and rendered incapa|ble by exclu&s;ion, and for incapacity excluded from affairs. In this circle the body is in a manner annihilated&mdash;and &s;o little means have they of any weighty exertion either to controul or to &s;upport the Crown, that if they at all interfere, it is only
<PB N="32" REF="68">
by abetting de&s;perate and mobbi&s;h in&s;urrections, like that at Madrid which drove Squillace from his place. Florida Blanca is a creature of office, and has little connexion, and no &s;ympathy with that body.</P>
<P>As to the Clergy, they are the only thing in Spain that looks like an independent order, and they are kept in &s;ome re&s;pect by the Inqui&s;i|tion, the &s;ole but unhappy re&s;ource of publick tranquillity and order now remaining in Spain. As in Venice, it is become mo&s;tly an engine of State, which indeed to a degree it has always been in Spain. It wars no longer with Jews and Hereticks: It has no &s;uch war to carry on. It's great object is to keep athei&s;tick and republican doctrines from making their way in that kingdom. No French book upon any &s;ubject can enter there which does not contain &s;uch matter. In Spain, the clergy are of moment from their influence, but at the &s;ame time with the envy and jealou&s;y that attend great riches and power. Though the Crown has by ma|nagement with the Pope got a very great &s;hare of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues into it's own hands, much &s;till remains to them. There will always be about that Court tho&s;e who look out to a farther divi&s;ion of the Church property as a re&s;ource, and to be obtained by &s;horter methods than tho&s;e of negotia|tions with the Clergy and their Chief.

<P>It is a melancholy reflection that the &s;pirit of melioration which has been going on in that part of Europe, more or le&s;s during this century, and the various &s;chemes very lately on foot for further

Refor|mation certainly is nearly connected with innovation&mdash;and where that latter comes in for too large a &s;hare, tho&s;e who undertake to improve their coun|try may ri&s;que their own &s;afety. In times where the correction, which includes the confe&s;&s;ion of an abu&s;e, is turned to criminate the authority which has long &s;uffered it, rather than to honour tho&s;e who would amend it (which is the &s;pirit of this malignant French di&s;temper) every &s;tep out of the common cour&s;e becomes critical, and renders it a ta&s;k full of peril for Princes of moderate talents to engage in great undertakings. At pre&s;ent the only &s;afety of Spain is the old national hatred to the French. How far that can be depended upon, if any great ferments &s;hould be excited, it is impo&s;|&s;ible to &s;ay.</P>
<P>As to Portugal, &s;he is out of the high road of the&s;e politicks&mdash;I &s;hall, therefore, not divert my thoughts that way; but return again to the North of Europe, which at pre&s;ent &s;eems the part mo&s;t in|tere&s;ted, and there it appears to me that the French &s;peculation on the northern countries, may be valued in the following, or &s;ome &s;uch manner.</P>

The King by his a&s;toni&s;hing activity, his boldne&s;s, his deci&s;ion, his ready ver&s;atility, and by rouzing and employing the old military &s;pirit of Sweden, keeps up the top with continual agitation and la&s;hing. The mo|ment it cea&s;es to &s;pin, the Royalty is a dead bit of box.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poland.</NOTE>Poland, from one cau&s;e or another, is always un|quiet. The new Con&s;titution only &s;erves to &s;upply that re&s;tle&s;s people with new means, at lea&s;t new modes, of cheri&s;hing their turbulent di&s;po&s;ition. The bottom of the character is the &s;ame. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Saxony.</NOTE>It is a great que&s;tion, whether the joining that Crown with the Electorate of Saxony, will contribute mo&s;t to &s;trengthen the Royal authority of Poland, or to &s;hake the Ducal in Saxony. The Elector is a Ca|tholick; the people of Saxony are, &s;ix &s;evenths at the very lea&s;t, Prote&s;tants. He <HI>mu&s;t</HI> continue a Ca|tholick according to the Poli&s;h law, if he accepts that Crown. The pride of the Saxons, formerly flattered by having a Crown in the Hou&s;e of their Prince, though an honour which co&s;t them dear; the German probity, fidelity and loyalty; the weight of the Con&s;titution of the Empire under the Treaty of We&s;tphalia; the good temper and good nature of the Princes of the Hou&s;e of Saxony; had for|merly removed from the people all apprehen&s;ion with regard to their religion, and kept them per|fectly quiet, obedient, and even affectionate. The &s;even years war made &s;ome change in the minds of the Saxons. They did not, I believe, regret the lo&s;s of what might be con&s;idered almo&s;t as the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion to the Crown of Poland, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which, by annexing them to a foreign intere&s;t, had often obliged them to act an arduous part, towards the &s;upport of which that foreign intere&s;t afforded
<PB N="37" REF="73">
no proportionable &s;trength. In this very delicate &s;ituation of their political intere&s;ts, the &s;peculations of the French and German <HI>Oeconomi&s;ts,</HI> and the ca|bals, and the &s;ecret, as well as public doctrines of the <HI>Illuminatenordens</HI> and <HI>Free Ma&s;ons,</HI> have made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in that country; and a tur|bulent &s;pirit under colour of religion, but in reality ari&s;ing from the French Rights of Man, has al|ready &s;hewn it&s;elf, and is ready on every occa&s;ion to blaze out.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Elector is a Prince of a &s;afe and quiet temper, of great prudence, and goodne&s;s. He knows that in the actual &s;tate of things, not the power and re&s;pect belonging to Sovereigns, but their very exi&s;tence depends on a rea&s;onable fruga|lity. It is very certain that not one Sovereign in Europe can either promi&s;e for the continuance of his authority in a &s;tate of indigence and in&s;olvency, or dares to venture on a new impo&s;ition to relieve him&s;elf. Without abandoning wholly the ancient magnificence of his Court, the Elector has con|ducted his affairs with infinitely more oeconomy than any of his predece&s;&s;ors, &s;o as to re&s;tore his finances beyond what was thought po&s;&s;ible from the &s;tate in which the &s;even years war had left Saxony. Saxony during the whole of that dreadful period having been in the hands of an exa&s;perated enemy, rigorous by re&s;entment, by nature and by nece&s;|&s;ity,
<PB N="38" REF="74">
was obliged to bear in a manner the whole burthen of the war; in the intervals when their al|lies prevailed, the inhabitants of that country were not better treated.</P>
<P>The moderation and prudence of the pre&s;ent Elector, in my opinion, rather perhaps re&s;pites the troubles than &s;ecures the peace of the Electorate. The offer of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Crown of Poland is truly critical, whether he accepts, or whether he declines it. If the States will con&s;ent to his ac|ceptance, it will add to the difficulties, already great, of his &s;ituation between the King of Pru&s;&s;ia and the Emperor. But the&s;e thoughts lead me too far, when I mean to &s;peak only of the interior con|dition of the&s;e Princes. It has always however &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary connexion with their foreign politicks.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Holland.</NOTE>With regard to Holland and the ruling party there, I do not think it at all tainted, or likely to be &s;o except by fear; or that it is likely to be mi&s;|led unle&s;s indirectly and circuitou&s;ly. But the pre|dominant party in Holland is not Holland. The &s;uppre&s;&s;ed faction, though &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, exi&s;ts. Un|der the a&s;hes, the embers of the late commotions are &s;till warm.

hanker after a French connexion; and now that the internal Government in France has been a&s;&s;i|milated in &s;o con&s;iderable a degree to that which the immoderate Republicans began &s;o very lately to introduce into Holland, their connexion, as &s;till more natural, will be more de&s;ired. I do not well under&s;tand the pre&s;ent exterior politicks of the Stadtholder, nor the Treaty into which the news|papers &s;ay he has entered for the States with the Emperor. But the Emperor's own politicks with regard to the Netherlands &s;eem to me to be exactly calculated to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of the French Re|volutioni&s;ts.

<P>The&s;e Provinces in which the French game is &s;o well played, they con&s;ider as part of the Old French Empire: certainly they were among&s;t the olde&s;t parts of it.

As to the greater nations, they do not aim at making a direct conque&s;t of them, but by di&s;turbing them through a propagation of their principles, they hope to weaken, as they will weaken them, and to keep them in perpetual alarm and agitation, and thus render all their efforts again&s;t them utterly

As this paper is become in a manner the only vi&s;ible maintenance of the whole people, the dread of a bankruptcy is more apparently connected with the delay of a counter-revolution, than with the du|ration of this Republick; becau&s;e the intere&s;t of the new Republick manife&s;tly leans upon it; and in my opinion, the counter-revolution cannot exi&s;t along with it.

I believe that the chiefs of the Revolution (tho&s;e who led the Con&s;tituting A&s;&s;embly) have contrived as far as they can do it, to give the Em|peror &s;atisfaction on this head. He keeps a con|tinual tone and po&s;ture of menace to &s;ecure this his only point.

Though it is manife&s;tly under the con&s;traint of impri&s;onment and the fear of death, that this unhappy man has been guilty of all tho&s;e humilities which have a&s;toni&s;hed mankind, the advi&s;ers of the Emperor will con&s;ider nothing

<P>The pre&s;ent policy therefore of the Au&s;trian po|liticians, is to recover de&s;poti&s;m through demo|cracy; or at lea&s;t, at any expence, every where to ruin the de&s;cription of men who are every where the objects of their &s;ettled and &s;y&s;tematick aver&s;ion, but more e&s;pecially in the Netherlands. Compare this with the Emperor's refu&s;ing at fir&s;t all inter|cour&s;e with the pre&s;ent powers in France, with his endeavouring to excite all Europe again&s;t them, and then his not only withdrawing all a&s;&s;i&s;tance and all countenance from the fugitives who had been drawn by his declarations from their hou&s;es, &s;ituations, and military commi&s;&s;ions, many even from the means of their very exi&s;tence, but treat|ing them with every &s;pecies of in&s;ult and outrage.</P>

out to all &s;ubjects, tending to &s;hew what little &s;up|port, or even countenance they are to expect from tho&s;e for whom their principle of fidelity may in|duce them to ri&s;que life and fortune.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Effect of Fear on the Sovereign Powers.</NOTE>The powers of Europe have a pretext for con|cealing their fears, by &s;aying that this language is not u&s;ed by the King; though they well know that there is in effect no &s;uch per&s;on, that the A&s;|&s;embly is in reality, and by that King is acknow|ledged to be <HI>the Ma&s;ter,</HI> that what he does is but matter of formality, and that he can neither cau&s;e nor hinder, accelerate or retard any mea&s;ure what|&s;oever, nor add to or &s;often the manife&s;to which the A&s;&s;embly has directed to be publi&s;hed, with the declared purpo&s;e of exciting mutiny and rebellion in the &s;everal countries governed by the&s;e powers. By the generality al&s;o of the menaces contained in this paper (though infinitely aggravating the out|rage) they hope to remove from each power &s;epa|rately the idea of a di&s;tinct affront. The per&s;ons fir&s;t pointed at by the menace are certainly the Princes of Germany, who harbour the per&s;ecuted hou&s;e of Bourbon and the Nobility of France; the declaration, however, is general, and goes to every &s;tate with which they may have a cau&s;e of quarrel. But the terror of France has fallen upon all nations. A few months &s;ince all Sovereigns &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed
<PB N="78" REF="114">
to unite again&s;t her, at pre&s;ent they all &s;eem to combine in her favour. At no period has the power of France ever appeared with &s;o formidable an a&s;pect. In particular the liberties of the Empire can have nothing more than an exi&s;tence the mo&s;t tot|tering and precarious, whil&s;t France exi&s;ts with a great power of fomenting rebellion, and the greate&s;t in the weake&s;t; but with neither power nor di&s;po|&s;ition to &s;upport the &s;maller &s;tates in their indepen|dence again&s;t the attempts of the more powerful.</P>
<P>I wind up all in a full conviction within my own brea&s;t, and the &s;ub&s;tance of which I mu&s;t repeat over and over again, that the &s;tate of France is the fir&s;t con&s;ideration in the politicks of Europe, and of each &s;tate, externally as well as internally con|&s;idered.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the topicks I have u&s;ed are drawn from fear and apprehen&s;ion. Topicks derived from fear or addre&s;&s;ed to it, are, I well know, of doubtful appearance. To be &s;ure, hope is in general the incitement to action. Alarm &s;ome men&mdash;you do not drive them to provide for their &s;ecurity; you put them to a &s;tand; you induce them not to take mea&s;ures to prevent the approach of danger, but to remove &s;o unplea&s;ant an idea from their minds; you per&s;uade them to remain as they are, from a new fear that their activity may bring on the ap|prehended mi&s;chief before it's time. I confe&s;s
<PB N="79" REF="115">
freely that this evil &s;ometimes happens from an overdone precaution; but it is when the mea&s;ures are ra&s;h, ill cho&s;en, or ill combined, and the ef|fects rather of blind terror than of enlightened fore&s;ight. But the few to whom I wi&s;h to &s;ubmit my thoughts, are of a character which will enable them to &s;ee danger without a&s;toni&s;hment, and to provide again&s;t it without perplexity.</P>
<P>To what lengths this method of circulating mutinous manife&s;tos, and of keeping emi&s;&s;aries of &s;edition in every Court under the name of Am|ba&s;&s;adors, to propagate the &s;ame principles and to follow the practices, will go, and how &s;oon they will operate, it is hard to &s;ay&mdash;but go on it will&mdash;more or le&s;s rapidly, according to events, and to the humour of the time. The Princes menaced with the revolt of their &s;ubjects, at the &s;ame time that they have ob&s;equiou&s;ly obeyed the &s;overeign mandate of the new Roman Senate, have received with di&s;tinction, in a publick character, Amba&s;&s;a|dors from tho&s;e who in the &s;ame act had circulated the manife&s;to of &s;edition in their dominions. This was the only thing wanting to the degradation and di&s;grace of the Germanick Body.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors from the Rights of Man, and their admi&s;&s;ion into the diplomatick &s;y&s;tem, I hold to be a new aera in this bu&s;ine&s;s. It will be the mo&s;t important &s;tep yet taken to affect the exi&s;t|ence

of Sovereigns, and the higher cla&s;&s;es of life&mdash;I do not mean to exclude it's effects upon all cla&s;&s;es&mdash;but the fir&s;t blow is aimed at the more prominent parts in the ancient order of things.</P>
<P>What is to be done?</P>
<P>It would be pre&s;umption in me to do more than to make a ca&s;e. Many things occur. But as they, like all political mea&s;ures, depend on di&s;po&s;i|tions, tempers, means, and external circum&s;tances, for all their effect, not being well a&s;&s;ured of the&s;e, I do not know how to let loo&s;e any &s;peculations of mine on the &s;ubject. The evil is &s;tated in my opinion as it exi&s;ts. The remedy mu&s;t be where power, wi&s;dom and information, I hope are more united with good intentions than they can be with me. I have done with this &s;ubject, I believe for ever. It has given me many anxious moments for the two la&s;t years. If a great change is to be made in human affairs, the minds of men will be &s;itted to it; the general opinions and feelings will draw that way. Every fear, every hope, will forward it; and then they who per&s;i&s;t in oppo&s;ing this mighty current in human affairs, will appear rather to re|&s;i&s;t the decrees of Providence it&s;elf, than the mere de&s;igns of men.

<P>THAT France, by it's mere geographical po|&s;ition, independently of every other cir|cum&s;tance, mu&s;t affect every State of Europe; &s;ome of them immediately, all of them through mediums not very remote.</P>
<P>That the &s;tanding policy of this kingdom ever has been to watch over the <HI>external</HI> proceedings of France (whatever form the <HI>interiour</HI> Government of that kingdom might take) and to prevent the exten&s;ion of it's dominion or it's ruling influence, over other States.</P>
<P>That, there is nothing in the pre&s;ent <HI>internal</HI> &s;tate of things in France, which alters the na|tional policy with regard to the exteriour relations of that country.</P>
<P>That there are, on the contrary, many things in the internal circum&s;tances of France (and perhaps
<PB N="84" REF="119">
of this country too) which tend to &s;ortify the prin|ciples of that fundamental policy; and which ren|der the active a&s;&s;ertion of tho&s;e principles more pre&s;&s;ing at this, than at any former time.</P>
<P>That, by a change effected in about three weeks, France has been able to penetrate into the heart of Germany; to make an ab&s;olute conque&s;t of Savoy; to menace an immediate inva&s;ion of the Netherlands; and to awe and overbear the whole Helvetick Body, which is in a mo&s;t perilous &s;itua|tion. The great Ari&s;tocratick Cantons having, perhaps, as much or more to dread from their own people whom they arm, but do not chu&s;e or dare to employ, as from the foreign enemy, which again&s;t all publick faith has butchered their troops, &s;erving by treaty in France. To this picture, it is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to add, the means by which France has been enabled to effect all this, namely the apparently entire de&s;truction of one of the large&s;t, and certainly the highe&s;t di&s;ciplined, and be&s;t appointed army ever &s;een, headed by the fir&s;t military Sovereign in Europe, with a Captain un|der him of the greate&s;t renown; and that without a blow given or received on any &s;ide. This &s;tate of things &s;eems to me, even if it went no further, truly &s;erious.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="120">
Circum&s;tances have enabled France to do all this by <HI>land.</HI> On the other element &s;he has begun to exert her&s;elf; and &s;he mu&s;t &s;ucceed in her de|&s;igns, if enemies very different from tho&s;e &s;he has hitherto had to encounter, do not re&s;i&s;t her.</P>
<P>She has fitted out a naval force, now actually at &s;ea, by which &s;he is enabled to give law to the whole Mediterranean. It is known as a fact (and if not &s;o known, it is in the nature of things highly probable) that &s;he propo&s;es the ravage of the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical State, and the pillage of Rome, as her fir&s;t object; that next &s;he means to bombard Na|ples; to awe, to humble, and thus to command all Italy&mdash;to force it to a nominal neutrality, but to a real dependence&mdash;to compel the Italian Prin|ces and Republicks to admit the free entrance of the French commerce, an open intercour&s;e, and the &s;ure concomitant of that intercour&s;e, the <HI>affili|ated &s;ocieties,</HI> in a manner &s;imilar to tho&s;e &s;he has e&s;tabli&s;hed at Avignon, the Comtat, Chamberry, London, Manche&s;ter, &amp;c. &amp;c. which are &s;o many colonies planted in all the&s;e countries, for extend|ing the influence, and &s;ecuring the dominion of the French Republick.</P>
<P>That there never has been hitherto a period in which this kingdom would have &s;uffered a French fleet to domineer in the Mediterranean, and to
<PB N="86" REF="121">
force ITALY to &s;ubmit to &s;uch terms as France would think &s;it to impo&s;e&mdash;to &s;ay nothing of what has been done upon land in &s;upport of the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem. The great object for which we pre&s;erved Minorea, whil&s;t we could keep it, and for which we &s;till retain Gibraltar, both at a great expence, was, and is, to prevent the predominance of France over the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>Thus far as to the certain and immediate effect of that armament upon the Italian States. The probable effect which that armament, and the other armaments preparing at Toulon, and other ports may have upon SPAIN, on the &s;ide of the Medi|terranean, is worthy of the &s;erious attention of the Briti&s;h councils.</P>
<P>That it is mo&s;t probable, we may &s;ay, in a man|ner certain, that if there &s;hould be a rupture be|tween France and Spain, France will not confinc her offen&s;ive piratical operations again&s;t Spain, to her efforts in the Mediterranean; on which &s;ide, however, &s;he may grievou&s;ly affect Spain, e&s;pecially if &s;he excites Morocco and Algiers, which un|doubtedly &s;he will, to fall upon that power.</P>
<P>That &s;he will fit out armaments upon the ocean, by which the flota it&s;elf may be intercepted, and thus the trea&s;ures of all Europe, as well as the
<PB N="87" REF="122">
large&s;t and &s;ure&s;t re&s;ources of the Spani&s;h monar|chy, may be conveyed into France, and become powerful in&s;truments for the annoyance of all her neighbours.</P>
<P>That &s;he makes no &s;ecret of her de&s;igns.</P>
<P>That, if the inward and outward bound flota &s;hould e&s;cape, &s;till France has more and better means of di&s;&s;evering many of the provinces in the We&s;t and Ea&s;t Indies, from the &s;tate of Spain, than Hol|land had when &s;he &s;ucceeded in the &s;ame attempt. The French marine re&s;embles not a little the old ar|maments of the Flibu&s;triers, which about a century back, in conjunction with pirates of our nation, brought &s;uch calamities upon the Spani&s;h colonies. They differ only in this, that the pre&s;ent piratical force is, out of all mea&s;ure and compari&s;on, greater; one hundred and fifty &s;hips of the line, and frigates being ready built, mo&s;t of them in a manner new, and all applicable in different ways to that &s;ervice. Privateers and Moori&s;h cor&s;aires po&s;&s;e&s;s not the be&s;t &s;eaman&s;hip, and very little di&s;cipline, and in|deed can make no figure in regular &s;ervice, but in de&s;perate adventures, and animated with a lu&s;t of plunder, they are truly formidable.</P>
<P>That the land forces of France are well adapted to concur with their marine in conjunct expeditions
<PB N="88" REF="123">
of this nature. In &s;uch expeditions, enterprize &s;up|plies the want of di&s;cipline, and perhaps more than &s;upplies it. Both for this, and for other &s;ervice (however contemptible their military is, in other re|&s;pects) one arm is extremely good, the Engineer|ing and Artillery branch. The old officer corps in both being compo&s;ed for the greater part of tho&s;e who were not gentlemen, or gentlemen newly &s;uch, few have abandoned the &s;ervice, and the men are veterans well enough di&s;ciplined, and very expert. In this piratical way they mu&s;t make war with good advantage. They mu&s;t do &s;o, even on the &s;ide of Flanders, either offen&s;ively or defen&s;ively. This &s;hews the difference between the policy of Louis the XIVth. who built a wall of bra&s;s about his kingdom: and that of Jo&s;eph the Second, who premeditatedly uncovered his whole frontier.</P>
<P>That Spain from the actual and expected preva|lence of French power, is in a mo&s;t perilous &s;itua|tion: perfectly dependent on the mercy of that Republick. If Au&s;tria is broken, or even hum|bled, &s;he will not dare to di&s;pute it's mandates.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, we have nothing at all to dread from the power of Spain by &s;ea, or by land, or from any rivalry in commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="124">
That we have much to dread from the con|nexions into which Spain may be forced.</P>
<P>From the circum&s;tances of her territorial po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, of her re&s;ources, and the whole of her civil and political &s;tate, we may be authorized &s;afely, and with undoubted confidence to affirm, that</P>
<P><HI>Spain is not a &s;ub&s;tantive Power:</HI></P>
<P>That &s;he mu&s;t lean on France, or on England.</P>
<P>That it is as much for the intere&s;t of Great Britain to prevent the predominancy of a French intere&s;t in that kingdom, as if Spain were a province of the Crown of Great Britain, or a State actually depen|dent on it; full as much &s;o as ever Portugal was reputed to be. This is a dependency of much greater value: and it's de&s;truction, or it's being carried to any other dependency, of much more &s;erious misfortune.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e two things mu&s;t happen. Either Spain mu&s;t &s;ubmit to circum&s;tances, and take &s;uch conditions as France will impo&s;e; or &s;he mu&s;t en|gage in ho&s;tilities along with the Emperor, and the King of Sardinia.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="125">
If Spain &s;hould be forced or awed into a treaty with the Republick of France, &s;he mu&s;t open her ports and her commerce, as well as the land com|munication for the French labourers, who were ac|cu&s;tomed annually to gather in the harve&s;t in Spain. Indeed &s;he mu&s;t grant a free communica|tion for travellers and traders through her whole country. In that ca&s;e it is not conjectural, it is certain, the Clubs will give law in the Provinces; Bourgoing, or &s;ome &s;uch mi&s;creant, will give law at Madrid.</P>
<P>In this England may acquie&s;ee if &s;he plea&s;es; and France will conclude a triumphant peace, with Spain under her ab&s;olute dependence, with a broad highway into that, and into every State of Europe. She actually invites Great Britain to di|vide with her the &s;poils of the new world, and to make a partition of the Spani&s;h Monarchy. Clearly it is better to do &s;o, than to &s;uffer France to po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e &s;poils, and that territory alone; which, with|out doubt, unre&s;i&s;ted by us, &s;he is altogether as able, as &s;he is willing to do.</P>
<P>This plan is propo&s;ed by the French, in the way in which they propo&s;e all their plans; and in the only way in which indeed they can propo&s;e them, where there is no regular communication between his Maje&s;ty and their Republick.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="126">
What they propo&s;e is <HI>a plan.</HI> It is a <HI>plan</HI> al&s;o to re&s;i&s;t their predatory project. To remain quiet, and to &s;uffer them to make their own u&s;e of a na|val power before our face, &s;o as to awe and bully Spain into a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive peace, or to drive them into a ruinous war, without any mea&s;ure on our part, I fear is no plan at all.</P>
<P>However, if the plan of co-operation which France de&s;ires, and which her affiliated &s;ocieties here ardently wi&s;h and are con&s;tantly writing up, &s;hould not be adopted, and the war between the Emperor and France &s;hould continue, I think it not at all likely that Spain &s;hould not be drawn into the quarrel. In that ca&s;e, the neutrality of England will be a thing ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible. The time is only the &s;ubject of deliberation.</P>
<P>Then the que&s;tion will be, whether we are to de|fer putting our&s;elves into a po&s;ture for the common defence, either by armament, or negotiation, or both, until Spain is actually attacked; that is, whether our Court will take a decided part for Spain, whil&s;t Spain on her &s;ide, is yet in a condi|tion to act with whatever degree of vigour &s;he may have; whil&s;t that vigour is yet unexhau&s;ted;&mdash;or whether we &s;hall connect our&s;elves with her broken fortunes; after &s;he &s;hall have received material blows, and when we &s;hall have the whole &s;low
<PB N="92" REF="127">
length of that always unwieldy, and all con&s;tructed, and then wounded and crippled body, to drag af|ter us, rather than to aid us. Whil&s;t our di&s;po&s;i|tion is uncertain, Spain will not dare to put her&s;elf in &s;uch a &s;tate of defence as will make her ho&s;ti|lity formidable, or her neutrality re&s;pectable.</P>
<P>If the deci&s;ion is &s;uch as the &s;olution of this que&s;tion (I take it to be the true que&s;tion) con|ducts to&mdash;no time is to be lo&s;t. But the mea&s;ures though prompt, ought not to be ra&s;h and indi|ge&s;ted. They ought to be well cho&s;en, well com|bined, and well pur&s;ued. The &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t be ge|neral: but it mu&s;t be executed, not &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, or with interruption, but all together, <HI>uno flatu,</HI> in one melting, and one mould.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, we mu&s;t put Europe before us, which plainly is, ju&s;t now, in all it's parts, in a &s;tate of di&s;may, derangement and confu&s;ion; and very po&s;&s;ibly among&s;t all it's Sovereigns, full of &s;e|cret heart-burning, di&s;tru&s;t, and mutual accu&s;ation. Perhaps it may labour under wor&s;e evils. There is no vigour any where, except the di&s;tempered vi|gour and energy of France. That country has but too much life in it, when every thing around is &s;o di&s;po&s;ed to tamene&s;s and languor. The very vices of the French &s;y&s;tem at home tend to give force to foreign exertions. The Generals <HI>mu&s;t</HI> join
<PB N="93" REF="128">
the armies. They mu&s;t lead them to enterprize, or they are likely to peri&s;h by their hands. Thus without law or government of her own, France gives law to all the Governments in Europe.</P>
<P>This great ma&s;s of political matter mu&s;t, have been always under the view of thinkers for the pub|lick, whether they act in office or not. Among&s;t events, even the late calamitous events were in the book of contingency. Of cour&s;e, they mu&s;t have been in de&s;ign, at lea&s;t, provided for. A plan which takes in as many as po&s;&s;ible of the States concerned, will rather facilitate and &s;implify a ra|tional &s;cheme for pre&s;erving Spain, (if that were our &s;ole, as I think it ought to be our principal object) than to delay and perplex it.</P>
<P>If we &s;hould think that a provident policy (per|haps now more than provident, urgent and nece&s;|&s;ary) &s;hould lead us to act, we cannot take mea|&s;ures as if nothing had been done. We mu&s;t &s;ee the faults, if any, which have conducted to the pre&s;ent misfortunes; not for the &s;ake of critici&s;m, military or political, or from the common motives of blaming per&s;ons and coun&s;els which have not been &s;ucce&s;sful; but in order, if we can, to admi|ni&s;ter &s;ome remedy to the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters, by the adop|tion of plans, more bottomed in principle, and
<PB N="94" REF="129">
built on with more di&s;cretion. Mi&s;takes may be le&s;&s;ons.</P>
<P>There &s;eem indeed to have been &s;everal mi&s;takes in the political principles on which the War was en|tered into, as well as in the plans upon which it was conducted; &s;ome of them very fundamental, and not only vi&s;ibly, but I may &s;ay, palpably erroneous; and I think him to have le&s;s than the di&s;cernment of a very ordinary State&s;man. who could not fore|&s;ee from the very beginning, unplea&s;ant con&s;e|quences from tho&s;e plans, though not the unparal|leled di&s;graces and di&s;a&s;ters which really did attend them: for they were, both principles and mea|&s;ures, wholly new and out of the common cour&s;e, without any thing apparently very grand in the conception, to ju&s;tify this total departure from all rule.</P>
<P>For, in the fir&s;t place, the united Sovereigns very much injured their cau&s;e by admitting, that they had nothing to do with the interiour arrange|ments of France; in contradiction to the whole tenour of the publick Law of Europe, and to the corre&s;pondent practice of all it's States, from the time we have any hi&s;tory of them.

their own true intere&s;ts, and tho&s;e of all the Sove|reigns of Germany and Europe. This admi&s;&s;ion of a fal&s;e principle in the Law of Nations, brought them into an apparent contradiction, when they in&s;i&s;ted on the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Royal Au|thority in France. But this confu&s;ed and contra|dictory proceeding gave ri&s;e to a practical error of wor&s;e con&s;equence. It was derived from one and the &s;ame root; namely, that the per&s;on of the Mo|narch of France was every thing; and the Mo|narchy, and the intermediate orders of the State, by which the Monarchy was upheld, were nothing. So that, if the united Potentates had &s;ucceeded &s;o far, as to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the authority of that King, and that he &s;hould be &s;o ill-advi&s;ed as to confirm all the confi&s;eations, and to recognize as a lawful body, and to cla&s;s him&s;elf with, that rabble of mur|derers (and there wanted not per&s;ons who would &s;o have advi&s;ed him) there was nothing in the principle, or in the proceeding of the United Powers, to prevent &s;uch an arrangement.</P>
<P>An expedition to free a brother Sovereign from pri&s;on, was undoubtedly a generous and chival|rous undertaking. But the &s;pirit and genero&s;ity would not have been le&s;s, if the policy had been more profound, and more comprehen&s;ive; that is, if it had taken in tho&s;e con&s;iderations, and tho&s;e per&s;ons, by whom, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, for
<PB N="96" REF="131">
whom, Monarchy exi&s;ts. This would become a bottom for a &s;y&s;tem of &s;olid and permanent policy, and of operations conformable to that &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The &s;ame fruitful error was the cau&s;e why no|thing was done to impre&s;s the people of France (&s;o far as we can at all con&s;ider the inhabitants of France as a people) with an idea that the Govern|ment was ever to be really French, or indeed any thing el&s;e than the nominal government of a Mo|narch, a Monarch ab&s;olute as over them, but who&s;e &s;ole &s;upport was to ari&s;e from foreign Poten|tates, and who was to be kept on his Throne by German forces; in &s;hort, that the King of France was to be a Viceroy to the Emperor and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>It was the fir&s;t time that foreign Powers inter|fering in the concerns of a nation divided into par|ties, have thought proper to thru&s;t wholly out of their councils, to po&s;tpone, to di&s;countenance, to reject, and in a manner to di&s;grace the party whom tho&s;e Powers came to &s;upport. The &s;ingle per&s;on of a King cannot be a party. Woe to the King who is him&s;elf his party! The Royal party with the King or his Repre&s;entatives at it's head, is the <HI>Royal cau&s;e.</HI> Foreign Powers have hitherto cho&s;en to give to &s;uch wars as this, the appearance of a civil conte&s;t, and not that of an ho&s;tile inva&s;ion.
<PB N="97" REF="132">
When the Spaniards, in the &s;ixteenth century, &s;ent aids to the chiefs of the League, they appeared as Allies to that League, and to the impri&s;oned King (the Cardinal de Bourbon) which that League had &s;et up. When the Germans came to the aid of the Prote&s;tant Princes, in the &s;ame &s;eries of civil wars, they came as Allies. When the Engli&s;h came to the aid of Henry the Fourth, they appear|ed as Allies to that Prince. So did the French always when they intermeddled in the affairs of Germany. They came to aid a party there. When the Engli&s;h and Dutch intermeddled in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Spain, they appeared as Allies to the Emperor Charles the Sixth. In &s;hort, the po|licy has been as uniform as it's principles were ob|vious to an ordinary eye.</P>
<P>According to all the old principles of law and policy, a regency ought to have been appointed by the French Princes of the Blood, Nobles, and Par|liaments, and then recognized by the combined Powers. Fundamental law and antient u&s;age, as well as the clear rea&s;on of the thing, have always ordained it during an impri&s;onment of the King of France; as in the ca&s;e of John, and of Francis the Fir&s;t. A Monarchy ought not to be left a mo|ment without a Repre&s;entative, having an intere&s;t in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The orders of the State, ought al&s;o to have been recognized in tho&s;e among&s;t
<PB N="98" REF="133">
whom alone they exi&s;ted in freedom, that is, in the Emigrants.</P>
<P>Thus laying down a firm foundation on the re|cognition of the authorities of the Kingdom of France, according to nature and to it's fundamen|tal laws, and not according to the novel and incon|&s;iderate principles of the u&s;urpation which the United Powers were come to extirpate. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia and the Emperor, as Allies of the antient Kingdom of France, would have proceeded with dignity, fir&s;t, to free the Monarch, if po&s;&s;ible; if not, to &s;ecure the Monarchy as principal in the de&s;ign; and in order to avoid all ri&s;ques to that great object (the object of other ages than the pre&s;ent, and of other countries than that of France) they would of cour&s;e avoid proceeding with more ha&s;te, or in a different manner than what the nature of &s;uch an object required.</P>
<P>Adopting this, the only rational &s;y&s;tem, the ra|tional mode of proceeding upon it, was to com|mence with an effective &s;iege of Li&s;le, which the French Generals mu&s;t have &s;een taken before their faces, or be forced to fight. A plentiful country of friends, from whence to draw &s;upplies, would have been behind them; a plentiful country of enemies, from whence to force &s;upplies, would have been before them. Good towns were always
<PB N="99" REF="134">
within reach to depo&s;it their ho&s;pitals and maga|zines. The March from Li&s;le to Paris, is through a le&s;s defen&s;ible country, and the di&s;tance is hardly &s;o great as from Longwy to Paris.</P>
<P>If the <HI>old</HI> politick and military ideas had govern|ed, the advanced guard would have been formed of tho&s;e who be&s;t knew the country, and had &s;ome intere&s;t in it, &s;upported by &s;ome of the be&s;t light troops and light artillery, whil&s;t the grand &s;olid body of an army di&s;ciplined to perfection, proceeded lei|&s;urely, and in clo&s;e connexion with all it's &s;tores, provi&s;ions, and heavy cannon, to &s;upport the ex|pedite body in ca&s;e of mi&s;adventure, or to improve and compleat it's &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The direct contrary of all this was put in prac|tice. In con&s;equence of the original &s;in of this project, the army of the French Princes was every where thrown into the rear, and no part of it brought forward to the la&s;t moment, the time of the commencement of the &s;ecret negotiation. This naturally made an ill impre&s;&s;ion on the people, and furni&s;hed an occa&s;ion for the rebels at Paris to give out that the faithful &s;ubjects of the King were di&s;tru&s;ted, de&s;pi&s;ed, and abhorred by his allies. The march was directed through a &s;kirt of Lor|raine, and thence into a part of Champagne, the Duke of Brun&s;wick leaving all the &s;tronge&s;t places
<PB N="100" REF="135">
behind him; leaving al&s;o behind him, the &s;trength of his artillery; and by this means giving a &s;u|periority to the French, in the only way in which the pre&s;ent France is able to oppo&s;e a German force.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the adoption of tho&s;e fal&s;e politicks, which turned every thing on the King's &s;ole and &s;ingle per&s;on, the whole plan of the war was reduced to nothing but a <HI>coup de main,</HI> in or|der to &s;et that Prince at liberty. If that failed, every thing was to be given up.</P>
<P>The &s;cheme of a <HI>coup de main,</HI> might (under fa|vourable circum&s;tances) be very fit for a partizan at the head of a light corps, by who&s;e failure no|thing material would be deranged. But for a royal army of eighty thou&s;and men, headed by a King in per&s;on, who was to march an hundred and fifty miles through an enemy's country&mdash;&s;urely this was a plan unheard of.</P>
<P>Although this plan was not well cho&s;en, and proceeded upon principles altogether ill judged and impolitick, the &s;uperiority of the military force, might in a great degree have &s;upplied the defects, and furni&s;hed a corrective to the mi&s;takes. The greater probability was that the Duke of Brun&s;wick would make his way to Paris, over the bellies of the
<PB N="101" REF="136">
rabble of drunkards, robbers, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, rioters, mu|tineers, and half-grown boys, under the ill-obeyed command of a theatrical, vapouring, reduced Cap|tain of cavalry, who oppo&s;ed that great Comman|der and great army. But&mdash;<HI>Diis aliter vi&s;um</HI>&mdash;He began to treat, the winds blew, and the rains beat, the hou&s;e fell&mdash;becau&s;e it was built upon &s;and&mdash;and great was the fall thereof. This march was not an exact copy of either of the two marches made by the Duke of Parma into France.</P>
<P>There is &s;ome &s;ecret. Sickne&s;s and weather may defeat an army pur&s;uing a wrong plan; not that I believe the &s;ickne&s;s to have been &s;o great as it has been reported: but there is a great deal of &s;uperfluous humiliation in this bu&s;ine&s;s, a perfect prodigality of di&s;grace. Some advantage, real or imaginary, mu&s;t compen&s;ate to a great Sovereign, and to a great General, for &s;o immen&s;e a lo&s;s of reputation. Longwy, &s;ituated as it is, might (one &s;hould think) be evacuated without a capitulation with a Republick ju&s;t proclaimed by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia as an u&s;urping and rebellious body. He was not far from Luxembourg. He might have taken away the obnoxious French in his flight. It does not appear to have been nece&s;|&s;ary that tho&s;e Magi&s;trates who declared for their own King, on the faith, and under the immediate protection of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, &s;hould be deli|vered over to the gallows. It was not nece&s;&s;ary that
<PB N="102" REF="137">
the emigrant Nobility and Gentry who &s;erved with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's army, under his immediate command, &s;hould be excluded from the cartel, and given up to be hanged as rebels. Never was &s;o gro&s;s, and &s;o cruel a breach of the public faith, not with an enemy, but with a friend. Dumourier, has dropped very &s;ingular hints. Cu&s;tine, has &s;poken out more broadly. The&s;e accounts have never been contradicted. They tend to make an eternal rup|ture between the Powers. The French have given out, that the Duke of Brun&s;wick endeavoured to negotiate &s;ome name and place for the captive King, among&s;t the murderers and pro&s;cribers of tho&s;e who have lo&s;t their all for his cau&s;e. Even this has not been denied.</P>
<P>It is &s;ingular, and indeed, a thing, under all it's circum&s;tances, inconceivable, that every thing &s;hould by the Emperor be abandoned to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. That Monarch was con&s;idered as prin|cipal. In the nature of things, as well as in his po&s;ition with regard to the war, he was only an ally; and a new ally, with cro&s;&s;ing intere&s;ts in many particulars, and of a policy rather uncertain. At be&s;t, and &s;uppo&s;ing him to act with the greate&s;t fidelity, the Emperor, and the Empire, to him mu&s;t be but &s;econdary objects. Countries out of Ger|many, mu&s;t affect him in a &s;till more remote man|ner. France, other than from the fear of it's doc|trinal
<PB N="103" REF="138">
principles, can to him be no object at all. Accordingly, the Rhine, Sardinia, and the Swi&s;s, are left to their fate. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia has no <HI>direct</HI> and immediate concern with France; <HI>con&s;e|quentially,</HI> to be &s;ure, a great deal; but the Empe|ror touches France <HI>directly</HI> in many parts: he is a near neighbour to Sardinia, by his Milane&s;e terri|tories; he borders on Switzerland; Cologne, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by his uncle, is between Mentz and Treves, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's territories on the Lower Rhine. The Emperor is the natural guardian of Italy and Germany; the natural balance again&s;t the ambition of France, whether Republican or Monarchical. His Mini&s;ters and his Generals, therefore, ought to have had their full &s;hare in every material con&s;ultation, which I &s;u&s;pect they had not. If he has no Mini&s;ter capable of plans of policy, which comprehend the &s;uperintendancy of a war, or no General with the lea&s;t of a political head, things have been as they mu&s;t be. However, in all the parts of this &s;trange proceeding, there mu&s;t be a &s;ecret.</P>
<P>It is probably known to Mini&s;ters. I do not mean to penetrate into it. My &s;peculations on this head mu&s;t be only conjectural. If the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, under the pretext, or on the reality of &s;ome information relative to ill practice on the part of the Court of Vienna, takes advantage of his
<PB N="104" REF="139">
being admitted into the heart of the Emperor's do|minions in the character of an ally, afterwards to join the common enemy, and to enable France to &s;eize the Netherlands, and to reduce and humble the Empire, I cannot conceive, upon every prin|ciple, any thing more alarming for this country, &s;e|parately, and as a part of the general &s;y&s;tem. After all, we may be looking in vain in the regions of po|liticks, for what is only the operation of temper and character upon accidental circum&s;tances&mdash;But I never knew accidents to decide the <HI>whole</HI> of any great bu&s;ine&s;s; and I never knew temper to act, but that &s;ome &s;y&s;tem of politicks, agreeable to it's peculiar &s;pirit, was blended with it, &s;trengthened it, and got &s;trength from it. Therefore the poli|ticks can hardly be put out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Great mi&s;takes have been committed; at lea&s;t I hope &s;o. If there have been none, the ca&s;e in fu|ture is de&s;perate. I have endeayoured to point out &s;ome of tho&s;e which have occurred to me, and mo&s;t of them very early.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, on a full and mature view and compa|ri&s;on of the hi&s;torical matter, of the tran&s;actions that have pa&s;&s;ed before our eyes, and of the future pro&s;pect, I think I am authorized to form an opi|nion without the lea&s;t he&s;itation.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="140">
That there never was, nor is, nor ever will be, or ever can be, the lea&s;t rational hope of making an impre&s;&s;ion on France by any Continental Powers, if England is not a part, is not the directing part, is not the &s;oul, of the whole confederacy again&s;t it.</P>
<P>This, &s;o far as it is an anticipation of future, is grounded on the whole tenour of former hi&s;tory&mdash;In &s;peculation it is to be accounted for on two plain principles.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That Great Britain is likely to take a more fair and equal part in the alliance, than the other Powers, as having le&s;s of cro&s;&s;ing intere&s;t, or per|plexed di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with any of them.</P>
<P>Secondly, Becau&s;e France cannot have to deal with any of the&s;e continental Sovereigns, without their feeling that nation, as a maritime Power, greatly &s;uperiour to them all put together; a force which is only to be kept in check by England.</P>
<P>England, except during the excentrick aberration of Charles the Second, has always con&s;idered it as her duty and intere&s;t, to take her place in &s;uch a confederacy. Her chief di&s;putes mu&s;t ever be with France, and if England &s;hews her&s;elf indiffe|rent and unconcerned when the&s;e Powers are com|bined
<PB N="106" REF="141">
again&s;t the enterprizes of France, &s;he is to look with certainty for the &s;ame indifference on the part of the&s;e Powers, when &s;he may be at war with that nation. This will tend totally to di&s;connect this kingdom from the &s;y&s;tem of Europe, in which, if &s;he ought not ra&s;hly to meddle, &s;he ought never wholly to withdraw her&s;elf from it.</P>
<P>If then England is put in motion, whether by a con&s;ideration of the general &s;afety, or of the influ|ence of France upon Spain, or by the probable operations of this new &s;y&s;tem on the Netherlands, it mu&s;t embrace in it's project the whole as much as po&s;&s;ible, and the part it takes ought to be as much as po&s;&s;ible a leading and pre&s;iding part.</P>
<P>I therefore beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That a Mini&s;ter &s;hould forthwith be &s;ent to Spain, to encourage that Court to per&s;evere in the mea&s;ures they have adopted again&s;t France; to make a clo&s;e alliance and guarantee of po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, as again&s;t France, with that power, and whil&s;t the formality of the treaty is pending, to a&s;&s;ure them of our protection, po&s;tponing any le&s;&s;er di&s;|putes to another occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Secondly, To a&s;&s;ure the Court of Vienna, of our de&s;ire to enter into our antient connexions with
<PB N="107" REF="142">
her, and to &s;upport her effectually in the war which France has declared again&s;t her.</P>
<P>Thirdly, To animate the Swi&s;s, and the King of Sardinia, to take a part, as the latter once did on the principles of the Grand Alliance.</P>
<P>Fourthly, To put an end to our di&s;putes with Ru&s;&s;ia, and mutually to forget the pa&s;t. I believe if &s;he is &s;atisfied of this oblivion, &s;he will return to her old &s;entiments, with regard to this Court, and will take a more forward part in this bu&s;ine&s;s than any other Power.</P>
<P>Fifthly, If what has happened to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia is only in con&s;equence of a &s;ort of panick or of levity, and an indi&s;po&s;ition to per&s;evere long in one de&s;ign&mdash;the &s;upport and concurrence of Ru&s;&s;ia will tend to &s;teady him, and to give him re&s;olution. If he be ill di&s;po&s;ed, with that power on his back, and without one ally in Europe, I conceive he will not be ea&s;ily led to derange the plan.</P>
<P>Sixthly, To u&s;e the joint influence of our Court, and of our then Allied Powers, with Holland, to arm as fully as &s;he can by &s;ea, and to make &s;ome ad|dition by land.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="143">
Seventhly, To acknowledge the King of France's next brother (a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;uch a Council and &s;uch Repre&s;entatives of the Kingdom of France, as &s;hall be thought proper) Regent of France, and to &s;end that Prince a &s;mall &s;upply of money, arms, cloath|ing and artillery.</P>
<P>Eighthly, To give force to the&s;e negociations, an in&s;tant naval armament ought to be adopted; one &s;quadron for the Mediterranean; another for the Channel. The &s;ea&s;on is convenient, mo&s;t of our trade being, as I take it, at home.</P>
<P>After &s;peaking of a plan formed upon the an|tient policy and practice of Great Britain, and of Europe; to which this is exactly conformable in every re&s;pect, with no deviation what&s;oever, and which is, I conceive much more &s;trongly called for by the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, than by any former, I mu&s;t take notice of another which I hear, but cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf to believe, is in agitation. This plan is grounded upon the very &s;ame view of things which is here &s;tated, namely, the danger to all Sovereigns, and old Republicks, from the prevalence of French power and influ|ence.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="144">
It is to form a Congre&s;s of all the European powers, for the purpo&s;e of a general defen&s;ive alli|ance, the objects of which &s;hould be,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The recognition of this new Republick (which they well know is formed on the princi|ples, and for the declared purpo&s;e of the de&s;truc|tion of all Kings), and whenever the heads of this new Republick &s;hall con&s;ent to relea&s;e the Royal Captives, to make Peace with them.</P>
<P>Secondly, To defend them&s;elves with their joint forces again&s;t the open aggre&s;&s;ions or the &s;ecret practices, intrigues and writings, which are u&s;ed to propagate the French principles.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to di&s;cover from who&s;e &s;hop this com|modity comes. It is &s;o perfectly ab&s;urd, that if that, or any thing like it, meets with a &s;erious entertainment in any Cabinet, I &s;hould think it the effect of what is called a judicial blindne&s;s, the certain forerunner of the de&s;truction of all Crowns and Kingdoms.</P>
<P>An <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> alliance, in which union is pre|&s;erved, by common efforts in common dangers, again&s;t a common active enemy, may pre&s;erve it's con&s;i&s;tency, and may produce for a given time,
<PB N="110" REF="145">
&s;ome con&s;iderable effect; though this is not ea&s;y, and for any very long period, can hardly be ex|pected. But a <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> alliance, formed of long di&s;cordant intere&s;ts, with innumerable di&s;cu&s;&s;ions exi&s;ting, having no one pointed object to which it is directed, which is to be held together with an unremitted vigilance, as watchful in peace as in war, is &s;o evidently impo&s;&s;ible, is &s;uch a chimera, is &s;o contrary to human nature, and the cour&s;e of human affairs, that I am per&s;uaded no per&s;on in his &s;en&s;es, except tho&s;e who&s;e Country, Religion and Sovereign, are depo&s;ited in the French funds, could dream of it. There is not the &s;lighte&s;t petty boundary &s;uit, no difference between a family ar|rangement, no &s;ort of mi&s;under&s;tanding, or cro&s;s purpo&s;e between the pride and etiquette of Courts, that would not entirely disjoint this &s;ort of alli|ance, and render it as &s;utile in it's effects, as it is feeble in it's principle. But when we con&s;ider that the main drift of that defen&s;ive alliance mu&s;t be to prevent the operation of intrigue, mi&s;chievous doctrine and evil example, in the &s;ucce&s;s of un|provoked rebellion, regieide, and &s;y&s;tematick a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ination and ma&s;&s;acre, the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch a &s;cheme becomes quite lamentable. Open the communication with France, and the re&s;t follows of cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="146">
How far the interiour circum&s;tances of this coun|try &s;upport what is &s;aid with regard to it's foreign politicks, mu&s;t be left to better judgments. I am &s;ure the French faction here is infinitely &s;trength|ened by the &s;ucce&s;s of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins on the other &s;ide of the water.&mdash;This evil in the heart of Europe mu&s;t be extirpated from that center, or no part of the circumference can be free from the mi&s;chief which radiates from it, and which will &s;pread circle beyond circle, in &s;pite of all the little defen&s;ive precautions which can be employed again&s;t it.</P>
<P>I do not put my name to the&s;e hints &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of reflecting men. It is of too little importance to &s;uppo&s;e the name of the writer could add any weight to the &s;tate of things con|tained in this paper. That &s;tate of things pre&s;&s;es irre&s;i&s;tibly on my judgment, and it lies, and has long lain, with an heavy weight upon my mind. I cannot think that what is done in France, is bene|ficial to the human race. If it were, the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution ought no more to &s;tand again&s;t it than the antient Con&s;titution of the kingdom in which the new &s;y&s;tem prevails. I thought it the duty of a man, not unconcerned for the publick, and who is a faithful &s;ubject to the King, re&s;pect|fully to &s;ubmit this &s;tate of facts at this new &s;tep

REMARKS ON THE POLICY OF THE ALLIES.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">BEGUN IN OCTOBER, 1793.</HEAD>
<P>AS the propo&s;ed manife&s;to is, I under&s;tand, to promulgate to the world the general idea of a plan for the regulation of a great kingdom, and through the regulation of that kingdom probably to decide the fate of Europe for ever, nothing requires a more &s;erious deliberation with regard to the time of making it, the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed, and the matter it is to contain.</P>
<P>As to the time, (with the due diffidence in my own opinion) I have &s;ome doubts whether it is not rather unfavourable to the i&s;&s;uing any Manife&s;to, with regard to the intended government of France; and for this rea&s;on, that it is, (upon the principal

point of our attack) a time of calamity and defeat. Manife&s;toes of this nature are commonly made when the army of &s;ome Sovereign enters into the enemy's country in great force, and under the im|po&s;ing authority of that force employs menaces towards tho&s;e whom he de&s;ires to awe; and makes promi&s;es to tho&s;e whom he wi&s;es to engage in his favour.</P>
<P>As to a party, what has been done at Toulon leaves no doubt, that the party for which we de|clare mu&s;t be that which &s;ub&s;tantially declares for Royalty as the ba&s;is of the government.</P>
<P>As to menaces&mdash;Nothing, in my opinion, can contribute more effectually to lower any Sovereign in the publick e&s;timation, and to turn his defeats into di&s;graces, than to threaten in a moment of im|potence. The &s;econd Manife&s;to of the Duke of Brun&s;wick appeared therefore to the world to be extremely ill-timed. However, if his menaces in that Manife&s;to had been &s;ea&s;onable, they were not without an object. Great crimes then appre|hended, and great evils then impending, were to be prevented. At this time, every act, which early menaces might po&s;&s;ibly have <HI>prevented,</HI> is done. Puni&s;hment and vengeance alone remain, and God forbid that they &s;hould ever be forgotten. But the puni&s;hment of enormous offenders, will
<PB N="117" REF="151">
not be the le&s;s &s;evere, or the le&s;s exemplary when it is not threatened at a moment when we have it not in our power to execute our threats. On the other &s;ide, to pa&s;s by proceedings of &s;uch a nefa|rious nature, in all kinds, as have been carried on in France, without any &s;ignification of re&s;entment, would be in effect to ratify them; and thus to become acce&s;&s;aries after the fact, in all tho&s;e enor|mities which it is impo&s;&s;ible to repeat, or think of without horror. An ab&s;olute &s;ilence appears to me to be at this time the only &s;afe cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;econd u&s;ual matter of Manife&s;toes is com|po&s;ed of <HI>promi&s;es</HI> to tho&s;e who co-operate with our de&s;igns. The&s;e promi&s;es depend in a great mea|&s;ure, if not wholly, on the apparent power of the per&s;on who makes them to fulfil his engagements. A time of di&s;a&s;ter on the part of the promi&s;er, &s;eems not to add much to the dignity of his per|&s;on, or to the effect of his offers. One would hardly wi&s;h to &s;educe any unhappy per&s;ons to give the la&s;t provocation to a mercile&s;s tyranny, without very effectual means of protecting them.</P>
<P>The time therefore &s;eems (as I &s;aid) not favourable to a general Manife&s;to, on account of the unplea|&s;ant &s;ituation of our affairs. However, I write in a changing &s;cene, when a mea&s;ure very imprudent to day, may be very proper to-morrow. Some
<PB N="118" REF="152">
great victory may alter the whole &s;tate of the que&s;|tion, &s;o far as it regards our <HI>power</HI> of fulfilling any engagement we may think fit to make.</P>
<P>But there is another con&s;ideration of far greater importance for all the purpo&s;es of this Manife&s;to. The publick, and the parties concerned, will look &s;omewhat to the di&s;po&s;ition of the promi&s;er indi|cated by his conduct, as well as to his power of fulfilling his engagements.</P>
<P>Speaking of this nation as part of a general com|bination of powers, are we quite &s;ure, that others can believe us to be &s;incere, or that we can be even fully a&s;&s;ured of our own &s;incerity in the pro|tection of tho&s;e who &s;hall ri&s;que their lives for the re&s;toration of Monarchy in France, when the world &s;ees, that tho&s;e who are the natural, legal, con&s;ti|tutional repre&s;entatives of that Monarchy, if it has any, have not had their names &s;o much as men|tioned in any one publick act; that in no way whatever are their per&s;ons brought forward, that their rights have not been expre&s;sly or implicitly allowed, and that they have not been in the lea&s;t con&s;ulted on the important intere&s;ts they have at &s;take. On the contrary, they are kept in a &s;tate of ob&s;curity and contempt, and in a degree of in|digence at times bordering on beggary. They are in fact, little le&s;s pri&s;oners in the village of
<PB N="119" REF="153">
Hanau, than the Royal captives who are locked up in the tower of the Temple. What is this, according to the common indications which guide the judgment of mankind, but, under the pretext of protecting the crown of France, in reality to u&s;urp it?</P>
<P>I am al&s;o very apprehen&s;ive, that there are other circum&s;tances which mu&s;t tend to weaken the force of our declarations. No partiality to the allied powers, can prevent great doubts on the fairne&s;s of our intentions as &s;upporters of the Crown of France, or of the true principles of legitimate Government in oppo&s;ition to Jacobini&s;m, when it is vi&s;ible that the two leading orders of the State of France, who are now the victims, and who mu&s;t always be the true and &s;ole &s;upports of Mo|narchy in that country, are, at be&s;t, in &s;ome of their de&s;criptions, con&s;idered only as objects of charity, and others are, when employed, employed only as mercenary &s;oldiers; that they are thrown back out of all reputable &s;ervice, are in a manner di&s;owned, con&s;idered as nothing in their own cau&s;e, and never once con&s;ulted in the concerns of their King, their country, their laws, their religion, and their property! We even affect to be a&s;hamed of them. In all our proceedings we carefully avoid the appearance of being of a party with them. In all our ideas of Treaty we do not regard
<PB N="120" REF="154">
them as what they are, the two leading orders of the kingdom. If we do not con&s;ider them in that light, we mu&s;t recognize the &s;avages by whom they have been ruined, and who have declared war upon Europe, whil&s;t they di&s;grace and per&s;ecute human nature, and openly defy the God that made them, as real proprietors of France.</P>
<P>I am much afraid, too, that we &s;hall &s;carcely be believed fair &s;upporters of lawful Monarchy again&s;t Jacobini&s;m, &s;o long as we continue to make and to ob&s;erve cartels with the Jacobins, and on fair terms exchange pri&s;oners with them, whil&s;t the Royali&s;ts, invited to our &s;tandard, and employed under our publick faith, again&s;t the Jacobins, if taken by that &s;avage faction, are given up to the executioner without the lea&s;t attempt what&s;oever at repri&s;al. For this, we are to look at the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's conduct, compared with his Mani|fe&s;toes about a twelvemonth ago. For this we are to look at the capitulations of Mentz and Va|lenciennes, made in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent cam|paign. By the&s;e two capitulations, the Chri&s;tian Royali&s;ts were excluded from any participation in the cau&s;e of the combined powers. They were con&s;idered as the outlaws of Europe. Two armies were in effect &s;ent again&s;t them. One of tho&s;e armies (that which &s;urrendered Mentz) was very near overpowering the Chri&s;tians of Poitou, and
<PB N="121" REF="155">
the other (that which &s;urrendered at Valenciennes) has actually cru&s;hed the people whom oppre&s;&s;ion and de&s;pair had driven to re&s;i&s;tance at Lyons, has ma&s;&s;acred &s;everal thou&s;ands of them in cold blood, pillaged the whole &s;ub&s;tance of the place, and pur|&s;ued their rage to the very hou&s;es, condemning that noble city to de&s;olation, in the unheard of manner we have &s;een it devoted.</P>
<P>It is then plain by a conduct which overturns a thou&s;and declarations, that we take the Royali&s;ts of France only as an in&s;trument of &s;ome conve|nience in a temporary ho&s;tility with the Jacobins, but that we regard tho&s;e athei&s;tick and murderous barbarians as the bon&acirc; fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the &s;oil of France. It appears at lea&s;t, that we con&s;ider them as a fair Government <HI>de facto,</HI> if not <HI>de jure;</HI> a re&s;i&s;tance to which in favour of the King of France, by any man who happened to be born within that country, might equitably be con&s;idered by other nations, as the crime of trea&s;on.</P>
<P>For my part, I would &s;ooner put my hand into the fire than &s;ign an invitation to oppre&s;&s;ed men to fight under my &s;tandard, and then on every &s;ini&s;ter event of war, cruelly give them up to be puni&s;hed as the ba&s;e&s;t of traitors, as long as I had one of the common enemy in my hands to be put to death in order to &s;ecure tho&s;e under my protection, and to
<PB N="122" REF="156">
vindicate the common honour of Sovereigns. We hear nothing of this kind of &s;ecurity in favour of tho&s;e whom we invite to the &s;upport of our cau&s;e. Without it, I am not a little apprehen&s;ive that the proclamations of the combined powers might (contrary to their intention no doubt) be looked upon as frauds, and cruel traps laid for their lives.</P>
<P>So far as to the corre&s;pondence between our declarations and our conduct, let the declaration be worded as it will, the conduct is the practical comment by which, and which alone it can be un|der&s;tood. This conduct acting on the declara|tion, leaves a Monarchy without a Monarch; and without any repre&s;entative or tru&s;tee for the Mo|narch, and the Monarchy. It &s;uppo&s;es a kingdom without &s;tates and orders; a territory without pro|prietors; and faithful &s;ubjects, who are to be left to the fate of rebels and traitors.</P>
<P>The affair of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Govern|ment is a very difficult undertaking for foreign powers to act in as <HI>principals;</HI> though as <HI>auxiliaries and mediators,</HI> it has been not at all unu&s;ual, and may be a mea&s;ure full of policy and humanity, and true dignity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing we ought to do, &s;uppo&s;ing us not giving the law as conquerors, but acting as
<PB N="123" REF="157">
friendly powers applied to for coun&s;el and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the &s;ettlement of a di&s;tracted country, is well to con&s;ider the compo&s;ition, nature, and temper of its objects, and particularly of tho&s;e who actually do, or who ought to exerci&s;e power in that &s;tate. It is material to know who they are, and how con&s;tituted, whom we con&s;ider <HI>as the people of France?</HI></P>
<P>The next con&s;ideration is, through whom our arrangements are to be made, and on what princi|ples the Government we propo&s;e is to be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion on the people is this, Whether we are to con&s;ider the individuals <HI>now actually in France, numerically taken and arranged into Jacobin Clubs,</HI> as the body politick, con&s;tituting the nation of France? or, Whether we con&s;ider the original individual proprietors of lands, expelled &s;ince the Revolution, and the &s;tates and the bodies politick, &s;uch as the colleges of ju&s;tice called parliaments, the corporations noble and not noble of balliages, and towns, and cities, the bi&s;hops and the clergy, as the true con&s;tituent parts of the nation, and forming the legally organized parts of the people of France?</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="158">
In this &s;erious concern it is very nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould have the mo&s;t di&s;tinct ideas annexed to the terms we employ; becau&s;e it is evident, that an abu&s;e of the term <HI>people,</HI> has been the original fundamental cau&s;e of tho&s;e evils, the cure of which, by war and policy, is the pre&s;ent object of all the &s;tates of Europe.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the acting power in France in any legal con&s;truction of publick law, as the people, the que&s;tion is decided in favour of the Republick one and indivi&s;ible. But we have decided for Monarchy. If &s;o, we have a King and Subjects; and that King and Subjects have rights and privi|leges which ought to be &s;upported at home; for I do not &s;uppo&s;e that the Government of that king|dom can, or ought to be regulated, by the arbi|trary Mandate of a foreign Confederacy.</P>
<P>As to the faction exerci&s;ing power, to &s;uppo&s;e that Monarchy can be &s;upported by principled Regicides, Religion by profe&s;&s;ed Athei&s;ts, Order by Clubs of Jacobins, Property by Committees of Pro&s;cription, and Juri&s;prudence by Revolu|tionary Tribunals, is to be &s;anguine in a degree of which I am incapable. On them I decide, for my&s;elf, that the&s;e per&s;ons are not the legal Corpo|ration of France, and that it is not with them we can (if we would) &s;ettle the Government of France.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="159">
Since, then, we have decided for Monarchy in that kingdom, we ought al&s;o to &s;ettle who is to be the Monarch, who is to be the Guardian of a Minor, and how the Monarch and Monarchy is to be modified and &s;upported? If the Monarch is to be elected, who the Electors are to be: if heredi|tary, what order is e&s;tabli&s;hed corre&s;ponding with an hereditary Monarchy, and fitted to maintain it? Who are to modify it in its exerci&s;e? Who are to re&s;train its powers where they ought to be limited, to &s;trengthen them where they are to be &s;upported, or to enlarge them, where the ob|ject, the time, and the circum&s;tances, may de|mand their exten&s;ion? The&s;e are things which, in the outline, ought to be made di&s;tinct and clear; for if they are not (e&s;pecially with regard to tho&s;e great points, who are the proprietors of the &s;oil, and what is the corporation of the kingdom) there is nothing to hinder the compleat e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Jacobin Republick, (&s;uch as that formed in 1790 and 1791) under the name of a Democracie Royale. Jacobini&s;m does not con&s;i&s;t in the having or not having, a certain Pageant under the name of a King, but <Q REND="inline">"in taking the people as equal individuals, without any corporate name or de|&s;cription, without attention to property, without divi&s;ion of powers, and forming the governmen of delegates from a number of men &s;o con&s;tituted,

<P>I hope no one can be &s;o very blind as to ima|gine that Monarchy can be acknowledged and &s;upported in France upon any othe ba&s;is than that of its property, <HI>corporate and individual,</HI> or that it can enjoy a moment's permanence or &s;ecu|rity upon any &s;cheme of things, which &s;ets a&s;ide all the antient corporate capacities and di&s;tinctions of the kingdom, and &s;ubverts the whole fabrick of its antient laws and u&s;ages, political, civil and re|ligious, to introduce a &s;y&s;tem founded on the &s;up|po&s;ed <HI>Rights of the Man, and the ab&s;olute equality of the human race.</HI> Unle&s;s, therefore, we declare clearly and di&s;tinctly in favour of the <HI>re&s;toration</HI> of property, and confide to the hereditary property of the kingdom, the limitation and qualifications of its hereditary Monarchy, the blood and trea&s;ure of Europe is wa&s;ted for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Jacobini&s;m in France. There is no doubt that Danton and Robe&s;piere, Chaumette and Barrere, that Condorcet, that Thomas Paine, that La Fayette, and the Exbi&s;hop of Autun, the Abb&eacute; Gregoire, with all the gang of the Syeyes's, the Henriots, and the Santerres, if they could &s;ecure them&s;elves in the fruits of their rebellion and robbery, would be perfectly indifferent, whether the mo&s;t unhappy

<P>It cannot be too often and too &s;trongly incul|cated, that Monarchy and property mu&s;t, in France, go together; or neither can exi&s;t. To think of the po&s;&s;ibility of the exi&s;tence of a per|manent and hereditary Royalty, <HI>where nothing el&s;e is hereditary or permanent in point either of per&s;onal or corporate dignity,</HI> is a ruinous chimera worthy of the Abb&eacute; Syeyes and tho&s;e wicked Fools his A&s;&s;ociates, who u&s;urped Power by the Murders of the 19th of July, and the 6th of October 1789, and who brought forth the Mon&s;ter which they called Democracie Royale, or the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I believe that mo&s;t thinking men, would prefer infinitely &s;ome &s;ober and &s;en&s;ible form of a Re|publick, in which there was no mention at all of a King, but which held out &s;ome rea&s;onable &s;ecurity to property, life, and per&s;onal freedom, to a &s;cheme of things like this Democracie Royale, founded on impiety, immorality, fraudulent currencies, the confi&s;cation of innocent individuals, and the pre|tended Rights of Man; and which, in effect, excluding the whole body of the nobility, clergy,
<PB N="128" REF="162">
and landed property of a great nation, threw every thing into the hands of a de&s;perate &s;et of ob&s;cure adventurers who led to every mi&s;chief, a blind and bloody band of Sans-Culottes. At the head, or rather at the tail of this &s;y&s;tem, was a mi&s;erable pageant as its o&s;ten&s;ible in&s;trument, who was to be treated with every &s;pecies of indignity, till the moment, when he was conveyed from the Palace of Contempt to the Dungeon of Horrour, and thence led by a Brewer of his Capital through the applau&s;es of an hired, frantick, drunken multitude, to lo&s;e his head upon a &s;caffold.</P>
<P>This is the Con&s;titution, or Democracie Royale; and this is what infallibly would be again &s;et up in France to run exactly the &s;ame round, if the predominant power &s;hould &s;o far be forced to &s;ub|mit as to receive the name of a King, leaving it to the Jacobins, (that is, to tho&s;e who have &s;ub|verted Royalty and de&s;troyed Property) to modify the one, and to di&s;tribute the other as &s;poil. By the Jacobins I mean indi&s;criminately the Bri&s;&s;otins and the Marati&s;ts, knowing no &s;ort of difference between them. As to any other party, none exi&s;ts in that unhappy country. The Royali&s;ts (tho&s;e in Poitou excepted) are bani&s;hed and extingui&s;hed; and as to what they call the Con&s;titutionali&s;ts, or <HI>Democrats Royaux,</HI> they never had an exi&s;tence of the &s;malle&s;t degree of power, con&s;ideration or autho|rity;
<PB N="129" REF="163">
nor, if they differ at all from the re&s;t of the Athei&s;tick Banditti (which from their actions and principles I have no rea&s;on to think) were they ever other than the temporary tools and in&s;tru|ments of the more determined, able, and &s;y&s;te|matick Regicides. Several attempts have been made to &s;upport this chimerical Democracie Royale&mdash;the fir&s;t was by La Fayette&mdash;the la&s;t by Dumourier:&mdash;they tended only to &s;hew, that this ab&s;urd project had no party to &s;upport it. The Girondi&s;ts under Wimpfen, and at Bourdeaux, have made &s;ome &s;truggle. The Con&s;titutionali&s;ts never could make any; and for a very plain rea|&s;on; they were <HI>Leaders in Rebellion.</HI> All their principles, and their whole &s;cheme of government being Republican, they could never excite the &s;malle&s;t degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m in favour of the un|happy Monarch, whom they had rendered con|temptible, to make him the Executive Officer in their new Commonwealth. They only appeared as traitors to their own Jacobin cau&s;e, not as faith|ful adherents to the King.</P>
<P>In an Addre&s;s to France, in an attempt to treat with it, or in con&s;idering any &s;cheme at all relative to it, it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould mean the geogra|phical, we mu&s;t always mean the moral and poli|tical country. I believe we &s;hall be in a great errour if we act upon an idea that there exi&s;ts in

that country any organized body of men who might be willing to treat on equitable terms, for the re&s;toration of their Monarchy; but who are nice in balancing tho&s;e terms, and who would accept &s;uch as to them appeared rea&s;onable, but who would quietly &s;ubmit to the predominant power, if they were not gratified in the fa&s;hion of &s;ome con&s;titution which &s;uited with their fancies.</P>

di&s;po&s;itions to re&s;i&s;t, or to withdraw him&s;elf from their power, his wife and children are cruelly to an&s;wer for it. It is by means of the&s;e ho&s;tages; that they keep the troops, which they &s;orce by ma&s;&s;es (as they call it) into the field&mdash;true to their colours.</P>
<P>Another of their re&s;ources is not to be forgotten.&mdash;They have lately found a way of giving a &s;ort of ubiquity to the &s;upreme Sovereign Authority, which no Monarch has been able yet to give to any repre&s;entation of his.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners of the National Convention, who are the Members of the Convention it&s;elf, and really exerci&s;e all its powers, make continual circuits through every province, and vi&s;its to every army. There they &s;uper&s;ede all the ordinary Au|thorities civil and military, and change and alter every thing at their plea&s;ure. So that in effect no deliberative capacity exi&s;ts in any portion of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Toulon, republican in principle, having taken its deci&s;ion <HI>in a moment under the guillotine,</HI> and before the arrival of the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners, Toulon, being a place regularly fortified, and having in its bo&s;om a navy in part highly di&s;contented, has e&s;caped, though by a &s;ort of miracle; and it would not have e&s;caped, if two powerful fleets had not

been at the door to give them not only &s;trong, but prompt and immediate &s;uccour, e&s;pecially, as neither this nor any other &s;ea-port town in France can be depended on, from the peculiarly &s;avage di&s;po&s;itions, manners, and connexions among the lower &s;ort of people in tho&s;e places. This I take to be the true &s;tate of things in France; <HI>&s;o far as it regards any exi&s;ting bodies, whether of legal or voluntary a&s;&s;ociation, capable of acting or of treating in corps.</HI></P>
<P>As to the oppre&s;&s;ed <HI>individuals,</HI> they are many; and as di&s;contented as men mu&s;t be under the mon&s;trous and complicated tyranny of all &s;orts, with which they are cru&s;hed. They want no &s;timulus to throw off this dreadful yoke: but they do want (not Manife&s;toes, which they have had even to &s;urfeit, but) real protection, force and &s;uccour.</P>
<P>The di&s;putes and que&s;tions of men at their ea&s;e, do not at all affect their minds, or ever can occupy the minds of men in their &s;ituation. The&s;e theories are long &s;ince gone by; they have had their day, and have done their mi&s;chief. The que&s;tion is not between the Rabble of Sy&s;tems, Fayettei&s;m, Condorceti&s;m, Monarchi&s;m, or Democrati&s;m or Federali&s;m, on the one &s;ide, and the fundamental Laws of France on the other&mdash;or between all the&s;e &s;y&s;tems among&s;t them&s;elves. It is a controver&s;y
<PB N="136" REF="170">
(weak indeed and unequal on the one part) between the proprietor and the robber; between the pri&s;oner and the jailor; between the neck and the guillotine. Four-fifths of the French inhabitants would thankfully take protection from the Emperor of Morocco, and would never trouble their heads about the ab&s;tract principles of the power by which they were &s;natched from impri&s;onment, robbery, and murder. But then the&s;e men can do little or nothing for them&s;elves. They have no arms, nor magazines, nor chiefs, nor union, nor the po&s;&s;i|bility of the&s;e things within them&s;elves. On the whole therefore I lay it down as a certainty, that in the Jacobins, no change of mind is to be expected&mdash;and that no others in the territory of France have an independent and deliberative exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The truth is, that France is out of it&s;elf&mdash;The moral France is &s;eparated from the geographical. The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e is expelled, and the robbers are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. If we look for the <HI>corporate people</HI> of France exi&s;ting as corporate in the eye and intention of public Law, (that corpo|rate people, I mean, who are free to deliberate and to decide, and who have a capacity to treat and conclude) they are in Flanders, and Germany, in Switzerland, Spain, Italy, and England. There are all the Princes of the Blood, there are all the
<PB N="137" REF="171">
Orders of the State, there are all the Parliaments of the kingdom.</P>
<P>This being, as I conceive, the true &s;tate of France, as it exi&s;ts <HI>territorially,</HI> and as it exi&s;ts <HI>morally,</HI> the que&s;tion will be, with whom we are to concert our arrangements; and whom we are to u&s;e as our in&s;truments in the reduction, in the pacification, and in the &s;ettlement of France. The work to be done mu&s;t indicate the workmen. Suppo&s;ing us to have rational objects, we have two principal, and one &s;econdary. The fir&s;t two are &s;o intimately connected as not to be &s;eparated even in thought; the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Royalty, and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Property. One would think it requires not a great deal of argument to prove, that the mo&s;t &s;erious endeavours to re&s;tore Royalty, will be made by Royali&s;ts. Property will be mo&s;t energetically re&s;tored by the antient proprietors of that kingdom.</P>
<P>When I &s;peak of Royali&s;ts, I wi&s;h to be under|&s;tood of tho&s;e who were always &s;uch from prin|ciple. Every arm lifted up for Royalty from the beginning, was the arm of a man &s;o principled. I do not think there are ten exceptions.</P>
<P>The principled Royali&s;ts are certainly not of force to effect the&s;e objects by them&s;elves. If they
<PB N="138" REF="172">
were, the operations of the pre&s;ent great Combi|nation would be wholly unnece&s;&s;ary. What I con|tend for is, that they &s;hould be con&s;ulted with, treated with, and employed; and that no Foreigners what&s;oever are either in intere&s;t &s;o engaged, or in judgment and local knowledge &s;o competent, to an&s;wer all the&s;e purpo&s;es as the natural proprietors of the country.</P>
<P>Their number for an exiled party is al&s;o con|&s;iderable. Almo&s;t the whole body of the landed proprietors of France, eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil, have been &s;teadily devoted to the Monarchy. This body does not amount to le&s;s than &s;eventy thou|&s;and&mdash;a very great number in the compo&s;ition of the re&s;pectable cla&s;&s;es in any &s;ociety.&mdash;I am &s;ure, that if half that number of the &s;ame de&s;cription were taken out of this country, it would leave hardly any thing that I &s;hould call the people of England. On the faith of the Emperor and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, a body of ten thou&s;and Nobility on hor&s;eback, with the King's two brothers at their head, &s;erved with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia in the cam|paign of 1792, and equipped them&s;elves with the la&s;t &s;hilling of their ruined fortunes and exhau&s;ted credit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before the Revolution the French Noble&s;&s;e were &s;o re|duced in numbers, that they did not much exceed twenty thou&s;and, at lea&s;t of full grown men. As they have been very cruelly formed into entire corps of &s;oldiers, it is e&s;ti|mated, that by the &s;word, and di&s;tempers in the field, they have not lo&s;t le&s;s than five thou&s;and men; and if this cour&s;e is pur&s;ued, it is to be feared, that the whole body of the French nobility may be extingui&s;hed. Several hundreds have al&s;o peri&s;hed by famine and various accidents.</NOTE>. It is not now the que&s;tion how that great

force came to be rendered u&s;ele&s;s and totally di&s;&s;i|pated. I &s;tate it now, only to remark, that a great part of the &s;ame force exi&s;ts, and would act if it were enabled. I am &s;ure every thing has &s;hewn us that in this war with France, one Frenchman is worth twenty foreigners. La Vendee is a proof of this.</P>
<P>If we wi&s;h to make an impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of any per&s;ons in France, or to per&s;uade them to join our &s;tandard, it is impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould not be more ea&s;ily led, and more readily formed and di&s;ciplined, (civilly and martially di&s;ciplined) by tho&s;e who &s;peak their language, who are ac|quainted with their manners, who are conver&s;ant with their u&s;ages and habits of thinking, and who have a local knowledge of their country, and &s;ome remains of antient credit and con&s;ideration, than with a body congregated from all tongues and tribes. Where none of the re&s;pectable native intere&s;ts are &s;een in the tran&s;action, it is impo&s;&s;ible that any declarations can convince tho&s;e that are within, or tho&s;e that are without, that any thing
<PB N="140" REF="174">
el&s;e than &s;ome &s;ort of ho&s;tility in the &s;tyle of a conqueror is meant. At be&s;t it will appear to &s;uch wavering per&s;ons, (if &s;uch there are) whom we mean to fix with us, at be&s;t a choice whether they are to continue a prey to dome&s;tick banditti, or to be fought for as a carrion carca&s;s, and picked to the bone by all the crows and vultures of the &s;ky. They may take protection, (and they would I doubt not) but they can have neither alacrity nor zeal in &s;uch a cau&s;e. When they &s;ee nothing but bands of Engli&s;h, Spaniards, Neapolitans, Sardi|nians, Pru&s;&s;ians, Au&s;trians, Hungarians, Bohe|mians, Sclavonians, Croatians, <HI>acting as principals,</HI> it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould think we come with a beneficent de&s;ign. Many of tho&s;e fierce and bar|barous people have already given proofs how little they regard any French party what&s;oever. Some of the&s;e nations the people of France are jealous of; &s;uch are the Engli&s;h, and the Spaniards&mdash;others they de&s;pi&s;e; &s;uch are the Italians&mdash;others they hate and dread; &s;uch are the German and Danu|bian powers. At be&s;t &s;uch interpo&s;ition of antient enemies excites apprehen&s;ion; but in this ca&s;e, how can they &s;uppo&s;e that we come to main|tain their legitimate Monarchy in a truly paternal French Government, to protect their privileges, their laws, their religion, and their property, when they &s;ee us make u&s;e of no one per&s;on who has any intere&s;t in them, any knowledge of them, or
<PB N="141" REF="175">
any the lea&s;t zeal for them? On the contrary, they &s;ee, that we do not &s;uffer any of tho&s;e who have &s;hewn a zeal in that cau&s;e, which we &s;eem to make our own, to come freely into any place in which the Allies obtain any footing.</P>
<P>If we wi&s;h to gain upon any people, it is right to &s;ee what it is they expect. We have had a pro|po&s;al from the Royali&s;ts of Poitou. They are well intitled, after a bloody war maintained for eight months again&s;t all the powers of anarchy, to &s;peak the &s;entiments of the Royali&s;ts of France. Do they de&s;ire us to exclude their Princes, their Clergy, their Nobility? The direct contrary. They earne&s;tly &s;olicit that men of every one of the&s;e de&s;criptions &s;hould be &s;ent to them. They do not call for Engli&s;h, Au&s;trian, or Pru&s;&s;ian officers. They call for French emigrant officers. They call for the exiled prie&s;ts. They have demanded the Comte d'Artois to appear at their head. The&s;e are the demands, (quite natural demands) of tho&s;e who are ready to follow the &s;tandard of Monarchy.</P>
<P>The great means therefore of re&s;toring the Monarchy which we have made <HI>the main object of the war,</HI> is to a&s;&s;i&s;t the dignity, the religion, and the property of France, to repo&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the means of their natural influence. This
<PB N="142" REF="176">
ought to be the primary object of all our politicks, and all our military operations. Otherwi&s;e every thing will move in a prepo&s;terous order, and nothing but confu&s;ion and de&s;truction will follow.</P>
<P>I know that misfortune is not made to win re&s;|pect from ordinary minds. I know that there is a leaning to pro&s;perity however obtained, and a prejudice in its favour; I know there is a di&s;po&s;ition to hope &s;omething from the variety and incon|&s;tancy of villany, rather than from the tire&s;ome uniformity of fixed principle. There have been, I admit, &s;ituations in which a guiding per&s;on or party might be gained over, and through him or them, the whole body of a nation. For the hope of &s;uch a conver&s;ion, and of deriving advantage from enemies, it might be politick for a while to throw your friends into the &s;hade. But examples drawn from hi&s;tory in occa&s;ions like the pre&s;ent will be found dangerou&s;ly to mi&s;lead us. France has no re&s;emblance to other countries which have undergone troubles and been purified by them. If France, jacobini&s;ed as it has been for four full years, did contain any bodies of authority and di&s;po&s;ition to treat with you, (mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly &s;he does not) &s;uch is the levity of tho&s;e who have expelled every thing re&s;pectable in their country, &s;uch their ferocity, their arrogance, their mutinous &s;pirit, their habits of defying every thing human
<PB N="143" REF="177">
and divine, that no engagement would hold with them for three months; nor indeed could they cohere together for any purpo&s;e of civilized &s;ociety, if left as now they are. There mu&s;t be a means not only of breaking their &s;trength within them|&s;elves, but of <HI>civilizing</HI> them; and the&s;e two things mu&s;t go together, before we can po&s;&s;ibly treat with them, not only as a nation, but with any divi&s;ion of them. De&s;criptions of men of their own race, but better in rank, &s;uperiour in property and decorum, of honourable, decent and orderly habits, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to bring them to &s;uch a frame as to qualify them &s;o much as to come into contact with a civilized nation. A &s;et of tho&s;e ferocious &s;avages with arms in their hands, left to them&s;elves in one part of the coun|try, whil&s;t you proceed to another, would break forth into outrages at lea&s;t as bad as their former. They mu&s;t, as fa&s;t as gained (if ever they are gained) be put under the guide, direction and government of better Frenchmen than them&s;elves, or they will in&s;tantly relap&s;e into a &s;ever of aggra|vated Jacobini&s;m.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not judge of other parts of France by the temporary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Toulon, with two va&s;t fleets in its harbour, and a garri&s;on far more numerous than all the inhabitants able to bear arms. If they were left to them&s;elves I am quite
<PB N="144" REF="178">
&s;ure they would not retain their attachment to Mo|narchy of any name, for a &s;ingle week.</P>
<P>To admini&s;ter the only cure for the unheard of di&s;orders of that undone country, I think it infi|nitely happy for us, that God has given into our hands, more effectual remedies than human con|trivance could point out. We have in our bo&s;om, and in the bo&s;om of other civilized &s;tates, nearer forty than thirty thou&s;and per&s;ons, providentially pre&s;erved not only from the cruelty and violence, but from the contagion of the horrid practices, &s;entiments and language of the Jacobins, and even &s;acredly guarded from the view of &s;uch abominable &s;cenes. If we &s;hould obtain in any con&s;iderable di&s;trict, a footing in France, we po&s;&s;e&s;s an immen&s;e body of phy&s;icians and magi&s;trates of the mind, whom we now know to be the mo&s;t di&s;creet, gentle, well tempered, conciliatory, virtuous, and pious per&s;ons, who in any order probably exi&s;ted in the world. You will have a mi&s;&s;ioner of peace and order in every pari&s;h. Never was a wi&s;er national oeconomy than in the charity of the Engli&s;h and of other countries. Never was money better ex|pended than in the maintenance of this body of civil troops for re-e&s;tabli&s;hing order in France, and for thus &s;ecuring its civilization to Europe. This means, if properly u&s;ed, is of value ine&s;ti|mable.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="179">
Nor is this corps of in&s;truments of civilization confined to the fir&s;t order of that &s;tate, I mean the clergy. The allied powers po&s;&s;e&s;s al&s;o, an exceedingly numerous, well informed, &s;en&s;ible, ingenious, high principled and &s;pirited body of cavaliers in the expatriated landed intere&s;t of France, as well qualified at lea&s;t, as I, (who have been taught by time and experience to moderate my calculation of the expectancy of human abili|ties) ever expected to &s;ee in the body of any landed gentlemen and &s;oldiers by their birth. France is well winnowed and &s;ifted. Its virtuous men are, I believe, among&s;t the mo&s;t virtuous, as its wicked are among&s;t the mo&s;t abandoned upon earth. Whatever in the territory of France may be found to be in the middle between the&s;e, mu&s;t be attracted to the better part. This will be compa&s;&s;ed, when every gentleman, every where being re&s;tored to his landed e&s;tate, each on his patrimonial ground, may join the Clergy in reani|mating the loyalty, fidelity and religion of the people; that the&s;e gentlemen proprietors of land, may &s;ort that people according to the tru&s;t they &s;everally merit, that they may arm the hone&s;t and well affected, and di&s;arm and di&s;able the factious and ill di&s;po&s;ed. No foreigner can make this di&s;|crimination nor the&s;e arrangements. The antient corporations of Burghers according to their &s;everal modes &s;hould be re&s;tored; and placed, (as they
<PB N="146" REF="180">
ought to be) in the hands of men of gravity and property in the cities or baillages, according to the proper con&s;titutions of the commons or third e&s;tate of France. They will re&s;train and regulate the &s;editious rabble there, as the gentlemen will on their own e&s;tates. In this way, and <HI>in this way alone,</HI> the country (once broken in upon by foreign force well directed) may be gained and &s;ettled. It mu&s;t be gained and &s;ettled by <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> and through the medium of its <HI>own</HI> native dignity and property. It is not hone&s;t, it is not decent, &s;till le&s;s is it poli|tick, for foreign powers them&s;elves to attempt any thing in this minute, internal, local detail, in which they could &s;hew nothing but ignorance, imbecility, confu&s;ion and oppre&s;&s;ion. As to the Prince who has a ju&s;t claim to exerci&s;e the regency of France, like other men he is not without his faults and his defects. But faults or defects (always &s;uppo&s;ing them faults of common human infirmity) are not what in any country de&s;troy a legal title to Govern|ment. The&s;e princes are kept in a poor ob&s;cure country town of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's. Their reputation is entirely at the mercy of every calum|niator. They cannot &s;hew them&s;elves, they can|not explain them&s;elves, as princes ought to do. After being well informed, as any man here can be, I do not find, that the&s;e blemi&s;hes in this emi|nent per&s;on, are at all con&s;iderable, or that they at all affect a character, which is full of probity,

honour, genero&s;ity, and real goodne&s;s. In &s;ome points he has but too much re&s;emblance to his un|fortunate Brother; who with all his weakne&s;&s;es, had a good under&s;tanding and many parts of an excellent man, and a good King.

His conver&s;ation is open, agreeable and informed, his manners gracious and princely. His brother the Comte'd Artois &s;u&s;tains &s;till better the repre&s;entation of his place. He is eloquent, lively, engaging in the highe&s;t degree, of a deci|ded character, full of energy and activity. In a word he is a brave, honourable, and accompli&s;hed cavalier. Their brethren of Royalty, if they were true to their own cau&s;e and intere&s;t, in&s;tead of relegating the&s;e illu&s;trious per&s;ons to an ob&s;cure town, would bring them forward in their courts and camps, and exhibit them to, what they would &s;pee|dily obtain, the e&s;teem, re&s;pect, and affection of mankind.</P>

<P>I am well appri&s;ed, that the little intrigners, and whi&s;perers, and &s;elf-conceited thoughtle&s;s babblers, wor&s;e than either, run about to depreciate the fallen virtue of a great nation. But whil&s;t they talk, we mu&s;t make our choice&mdash;they or the Jacobins. We have no other option.

In&s;tead of in&s;piring me with di&s;like and di&s;tru&s;t of the unfortunate, engaged with us in a common cau&s;e again&s;t our jacobin enemy, they take away all my e&s;teem for their own characters, and all my deference to their judg|ment.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome few French gentlemen indeed who talk a language not wholly different from this jargon. Tho&s;e whom I have in my eye, I re&s;pect as gallant &s;oldiers, as much as any one can do, but
<PB N="150" REF="184">
on their political judgment, and prudence, I have not the &s;lighte&s;t reliance, nor on their knowledge of their own country, or of its laws and con&s;titu|tion. They are, if not enemies, at lea&s;t not friends to the orders of their own &s;tate; not to the Princes, the Clergy, or the Nobility; they po&s;&s;e&s;s only an attachment to the Monarchy, or rather to the per&s;ons of the late King and Queen. In all other re&s;pects their conver&s;ation is Jacobin. I am afraid they or &s;ome of them, go into the clo&s;ets of Mini&s;ters, and tell them that the affairs of France will be better arranged by the allied Powers than by the landed proprietors of the kingdom, or by the Princes who have a right to govern; and that if any French are at all to be employed in the &s;ettlement of their country, it ought to be only tho&s;e who have never declared any decided opinion or taken any active part in the Revolution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was the language of the Mini&s;teriali&s;ts.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I &s;u&s;pect that the authors of this opinion are mere &s;oldiers of fortune, who, though men of integrity and honour, would as gladly receive military rank from Ru&s;&s;ia, or Au&s;tria, or Pru&s;&s;ia, as from the Regent of France. Perhaps their not having as much importance at his court as they could wi&s;h, may incline them to this &s;trange imagination. Perhaps having no property in old France, they

are more indifferent about its re&s;toration. Their language is certainly flattering to all Mini&s;ters in all courts. We all are men; we all love to be told of the extent of our own power and our own faculties. If we love glory, we are jealous of partners, and afraid even of our own in&s;truments. It is of all modes of flattery the mo&s;t effectual to be told, that you can regulate the affairs of another kingdom better than its hereditary proprietors. It is formed to flatter the principle of conque&s;t &s;o natural to all men. It is this principle which is now making the partition of Poland. The powers concerned have been told by &s;ome perfidious Poles, and perhaps they believe, that their u&s;urpation is a great benefit to the people, e&s;pecially to the com|mon people. However this may turn out with regard to Poland, I am quite &s;ure that France could not be &s;o well under a foreign direction as under that of the repre&s;entatives of its own King, and its own antient E&s;tates.</P>
<P>I think I have my&s;elf &s;tudied France, as much as mo&s;t of tho&s;e whom the allied courts are likely to employ in &s;uch a work. I have likewi&s;e of my&s;elf as partial and as vain an opinion as men commonly have of them&s;elves. But if I could command the whole military arm of Europe, I am &s;ure, that a bribe of the be&s;t province in that kingdom, would not tempt me to intermeddle in their affairs, except

<P>The Government of that kingdom is funda|mentally Monarchical. The publick law of Europe has never recognized in it any other form of Go|vernment. The Potentates of Europe have by that law, a right, an intere&s;t, and a duty to know with what government they are to treat, and what they are to admit into the federative Society, or in other words into the diplomatick Republick of Europe. This Right is clear and indi&s;putable.</P>
<P>What other and further interference they have a right to in the interior of the concerns of another people, is a matter on which, as on every political &s;ubject, no very definite or po&s;itive rule can well be laid down. Our neighbours are men; and who will attempt to dictate the laws, under which it is allowable or forbidden to take a part in the concerns of men, whether they are con&s;idered individually or in a collective capacity, whenever charity to them, or a care of my own &s;afety, calls forth my

The late&s;t ca&s;ui&s;ts of public law are rather of a Repub|lican ca&s;t, and in my mind, by no means &s;o aver&s;e as they ought to be to a Right in the people (a word which ill defined is of the mo&s;t dangerous u&s;e) to make changes at their plea&s;ure in the fun|damental laws of their country.

This interfer|ence mu&s;t indeed always be a Right, whil&s;t the privilege of doing good to others, and of averting from them every &s;ort of evil, is a Right: Circum|&s;tances may render that Right a Duty. It depends wholly on this, whether it be a <HI>bona fide</HI> charity to a party, and a prudent precaution with regard to your&s;elf, or whether under the pretence of aiding one of the parties in a nation, you act in &s;uch a manner as to aggravate its calamities, and accom|pli&s;h its final de&s;truction.

It will be a ju&s;t and irre&s;i&s;tible pre&s;umption again&s;t the fairne&s;s of the interpo&s;ing power, that he takes with him no party or de&s;cription of men in the divided &s;tate. It is not probable, that the&s;e parties &s;hould all, and all alike, be more adver&s;e to the true intere&s;ts of their country, and le&s;s ca|pable of forming a judgment upon them, than tho&s;e who are ab&s;olute &s;trangers to their affairs, and to the character of the actors in them, and have but a remote, feeble, and &s;econdary &s;ympa|thy with their intere&s;t.

Except him, I do not recollect a man of rank or talents, who by his &s;peeches or his votes, by his pen or by his &s;word, has not been active on this &s;cene. The time indeed could admit no neutrality in any per&s;on worthy of the name of man. There were originally two great divi&s;ions in France; the one is that which overturned the whole of the Govern|ment in Church and State, and erected a Republic on the ba&s;is of Athei&s;m. Their grand engine was the Jacobin Club, a &s;ort of &s;ece&s;&s;ion from which, but exactly on the &s;ame principles, begat another &s;hort|lived one, called the Club of Eighty Nine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t object of this Club was the propagation of Jacobin principles.</NOTE>, which was chiefly guided by the Court Rebels, who, in addition to the crimes of which they were guilty in common with the others, had the merit of betray|ing a gracious Ma&s;ter, and a kind Benefactor. Subdivi&s;ions of this faction, which &s;ince we have &s;een, do not in the lea&s;t differ from each other in their principles, their di&s;po&s;itions, or the means they have employed. Their only quarrel has been about power: in that quarrel, like wave &s;ucceeding wave, one faction has got the better and expelled the other.

I can very truly &s;ay, that I have not found by ob|&s;ervation or enquiry, that any &s;en&s;e of the evils produced by their projects has produced in them, or any <HI>one</HI> of them, the &s;malle&s;t degree of repent|ance. Di&s;appointment and mortification undoubt|edly they feel: but to them, repentance is a thing impo&s;&s;ible. They are Athei&s;ts. This wretched opinion, by which they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed even to the height of fanatici&s;m, leading them to exclude from their ideas of a Commonwealth, the vital principle of the phy&s;ical, the moral, and the political world, engages them in a thou&s;and ab&s;urd contrivances, to fill up this dreadful void. Incapable of innoxious repo&s;e, or honourable action, or wi&s;e &s;peculation, in the lurking holes of a foreign land, into which (in a common ruin) they are driven to hide their heads among&s;t the innocent victims of their madne&s;s, they are at this very hour, as bu&s;y in the confection of the dirt-pyes of their imaginary Con&s;titutions, as if
<PB N="158" REF="192">
they had not been quite fre&s;h from de&s;troying by their impious and de&s;perate vagaries, the fine&s;t country upon earth.</P>
<P>It is however, out of the&s;e, or of &s;uch as the&s;e, guilty and impenitent, de&s;pi&s;ing the experience of others, and their own, that &s;ome people talk of chu&s;ing their Negotiators with tho&s;e Jacobins, who they &s;uppo&s;e may be recovered to a &s;ounder mind. They flatter them&s;elves, it &s;eems, that the friendly habits formed during their original partner&s;hip of iniquity, a &s;imilarity of character, and a con|formity in the ground-work of their principles, might facilitate their conver&s;ion, and gain them over to &s;ome recognition of Royalty. But &s;urely this is to read human nature very ill. The &s;everal Sectaries in this &s;chi&s;m of the Jacobins, are the very la&s;t men in the world to tru&s;t each other. Fellow|&s;hip in Trea&s;on, is a bad ground of confidence. The la&s;t quarrels are the &s;ore&s;t; and the injuries received or offered by your own a&s;&s;ociates, are ever the mo&s;t bitterly re&s;ented. The people of France of every name and de&s;cription, would a thou&s;and times &s;ooner li&s;ten to the Prince de Cond&eacute;, or to the Archbi&s;hop of Aix, or the Bi&s;hop of St. Pol, or to Mon&s;ieur De Cazal&egrave;s, than to La Fayette, or Dumourier, or the Vicomte De Noailles, or the Bi&s;hop of Autun, or Necker, or his Di&s;ciple Lally Tolendal. Again&s;t the fir&s;t de&s;cription they have

not the &s;malle&s;t animo&s;ity beyond that of a merely political di&s;&s;ention. The others they regard as Traitors.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t de&s;cription is that of the Chri&s;tian Royali&s;ts, men who as earne&s;tly wi&s;hed for refor|mation, as they oppo&s;ed innovation in the funda|mental parts of their Church and State. <HI>Their</HI> part has been <HI>very decided.</HI> Accordingly they are to be &s;et a&s;ide in the re&s;toration of Church and State. It is an odd kind of di&s;qualification where the re&s;toration of Religion and Monarchy is the que&s;tion. If England &s;hould (God forbid it &s;hould) fall into the &s;ame misfortune with France, and that the Court of Vienna &s;hould undertake the re&s;tora|tion of our Monarchy, I think it would be extraor|dinary to object to the admi&s;&s;ion of Mr. Pitt, or Lord Grenville, or Mr. Dundas into any &s;hare in the management of that bu&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e in a day of trial they have &s;tood up firmly and manfully, as I tru&s;t they always will do, and with di&s;tingui&s;hed powers, for the Monarchy and the legitimate Con|&s;titution of their country. I am &s;ure if I were to &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf at Vienna at &s;uch a time, I &s;hould, as a Man, as an Engli&s;hman, and as a Royali&s;t, prote&s;t in that ca&s;e, as I do in this, again&s;t a weak and ruin|ous principle of proceeding, which can have no other tendency, than to make tho&s;e who wi&s;h to &s;upport the Crown, meditate too profoundly on the con&s;e|quences

of the part they take&mdash;and con&s;ider whe|ther for their open and forward zeal in the Royal Cau&s;e, they may not be thru&s;t out from any &s;ort of confidence and employment, where the intere&s;t of crowned heads is concerned.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the <HI>Parties.</HI> I have &s;aid, and &s;aid truly, that I know of no neutrals. But as a general ob&s;ervation on this general principle of chu&s;ing neutrals on &s;uch occa&s;ions as the pre&s;ent, I have this to &s;ay&mdash;that it amounts to neither more nor le&s;s than this &s;hocking propo&s;ition&mdash;that we ought to ex|clude men of honour and ability from &s;erving theirs and our cau&s;e; and to put the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of our&s;elves and our po&s;terity into the hands of men of no decided character, without judgment to chu&s;e, and without courage to profe&s;s any prin|ciple what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Such men can &s;erve no cau&s;e, for this plain rea|&s;on&mdash;they have no cau&s;e at heart. They can at be&s;t work only as mere mercenaries. They have not been guilty of great crimes; but it is only be|cau&s;e they have not energy of mind to ri&s;e to any height of wickedne&s;s. They are not hawks or kites; they are only mi&s;erable fowls who&s;e flight is not above their dunghill or henroo&s;t. But they tremble before the authors of the&s;e horrors. They admire them at a &s;afe and re&s;pectful di&s;tance.
<PB N="161" REF="195">
There never was a mean and abject mind that did not admire an intrepid and dexterous villain. In the bottom of their hearts they believe &s;uch hardy mi&s;creants to be the only men qualified for great affairs: if you &s;et them to tran&s;act with &s;uch per|&s;ons, they are in&s;tantly &s;ubdued. They dare not &s;o much as look their antagoni&s;t in the face. They are made to be their &s;ubjects, not to be their arbiters or controllers.</P>
<P>The&s;e men to be &s;ure can look at atrocious acts without indignation, and can behold &s;uffering virtue without &s;ympathy. Therefore they are con&s;idered as &s;ober di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate men But they have their pa&s;&s;ions, though of another kind, and which are infinitely more likely to carry them out of the path of their duty. They are of a tame, timid, languid, inert temper wherever the welfare of <HI>others</HI> is concerned. In &s;uch cau&s;es, as they have no motives to action, they never po&s;&s;e&s;s any real ability, and are totally de&s;titute of all re&s;ource.</P>
<P>Believe a man who has &s;een much, and ob&s;erved &s;omething. I have &s;een in the cour&s;e of my life a great many of that family of men. They are generally cho&s;en, becau&s;e they have no opinion of their own; and as far as they can be got in good earne&s;t to embrace any opinion, it is that of who|ever happens to employ them (neither longer or
<PB N="162" REF="196">
&s;horter, narrower or broader) with whom they have no di&s;cu&s;&s;ion or con&s;ultation. The only thing which occurs to &s;uch a man when he has got a bu&s;ine&s;s for others into his hands, is how to make his own fortune out of it. The per&s;on he is to treat with, is not, with him, an adver&s;ary over whom he is to prevail, but a new friend he is to gain: therefore he always &s;y&s;tematically betrays &s;ome part of his tru&s;t. In&s;tead of thinking how he &s;hall defend his ground to the la&s;t, and if forced to re|treat, how little he &s;hall give up, this kind of man con&s;iders how much of the intere&s;t of his employer he is to &s;acrifice to his adver&s;ary. Having nothing but him&s;elf in view, he knows, that in &s;erving his principal with zeal, he mu&s;t probably incur &s;ome re&s;entment from the oppo&s;ite party. His object is to obtain the good will of the per&s;on with whom he contends, that when an agreement is made, he may join in rewarding him. I would not take one of the&s;e as my arbitrator in a di&s;pute for &s;o much as a fi&s;h-pond&mdash;for if he re&s;erved the mud to me, he would be &s;ure to give the water that fed the pool, to my adver&s;ary. In a great cau&s;e I &s;hould cer|tainly wi&s;h, that my agent &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s conciliat|ing qualities; that he &s;hould be of a frank, open, and candid di&s;po&s;ition, &s;oft in his nature, and of a temper to &s;often animo&s;ities and to win confidence. He ought not to be a man odious to the per&s;on he treats with, by per&s;onal injury, by violence, or by
<PB N="163" REF="197">
deceit, or, above all, by the dereliction of his cau&s;e in any former tran&s;actions. But I would be &s;ure that my Negotiator &s;hould be <HI>mine,</HI> that he &s;hould be as earne&s;t in the cau&s;e as my&s;elf, and known to be &s;o; that he &s;hould not be looked upon as a &s;tipendiary advocate, but as a principled partizan. In all treaty it is a great point that all idea of gaining your agent is hopele&s;s. I would not tru&s;t the cau&s;e of Royalty with a man, who, profe&s;&s;ing neutrality, is half a Republican. The Enemy has already a great part of his &s;uit without a &s;truggle&mdash;and he contends with advantage for all the re&s;t. The common principle allowed between your adver&s;ary and your agent, gives your adver&s;ary the advantage in every di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Before I &s;hut up this Di&s;cour&s;e about neutral Agency (which I conceive is not to be found, or if found, ought not to be u&s;ed) I have a few other remarks to make on the cau&s;e, which I conceive gives ri&s;e to it.</P>
<P>In all that we do, whether in the &s;truggle or after it, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould con&s;tantly have in our eye, the nature and character of the enemy we have to contend with. The Jacobin Revolution is carried on by men of no rank, of no con&s;idera|tion, of wild &s;avage minds, full of levity, arrogance and pre&s;umption, without morals, without probity,

without prudence.

If we meet this dreadful and portentous energy, re&s;trained by no con&s;ideration of God or man, that is always vigilant, always on the attack, that allows it&s;elf no repo&s;e, and &s;uffers none to re&s;t an hour with impu|nity; if we meet this energy with poor common|place proceeding, with trivial maxims, paltry old &s;aws, with doubts, fears and &s;u&s;picions, with a languid, uncertain he&s;itation, with a formal, official &s;pirit, which is turned a&s;ide by every ob&s;tacle from its purpo&s;e, and which never &s;ees a difficulty but to yield to it, or at be&s;t to evade it; down we go to the bottom of the aby&s;s&mdash;and nothing &s;hort of Omnipotence can &s;ave us. We mu&s;t meet a vi|cious and di&s;tempered energy with a manly and rational vigour. As virtue is limited in its re&s;ources&mdash;we are doubly bound to u&s;e all that, in the circle drawn about us by our morals, we are able to command.</P>
<P>I do not contend again&s;t the advantages of di&s;|tru&s;t. In the world we live in it is but too nece&s;|&s;ary.

Some of old called it the very &s;inews of di&s;cretion. But what &s;ignify common-places, that always run parallel and equal?

But in France we hold nothing. We are to break in upon a power in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; we are to carry every thing by &s;torm, or by &s;urprize, or by intelligence, or by all. Adventure therefore, and not caution, is our policy. Here to be too pre&s;uming is the better error.</P>
<P>The world will judge of the &s;pirit of our pro|ceeding in tho&s;e places of France which may fall into our power, by our conduct in tho&s;e that are already in our hands. Our wi&s;dom &s;hould not be vulgar. Other times, perhaps other mea&s;ures: But in this awful hour our politicks ought to be made up of nothing but courage, deci&s;ion, manline&s;s, and rectitude.

Never can we a&s;&s;ume this command if we will not ri&s;que the con&s;equences.

In the ca&s;e of the King of France, declared to be our friend and ally, we will &s;till be con&s;idering our&s;elves in the contradictory character of an ene|my. This contradiction, I am afraid, will, in &s;pite of us, give a colour of fraud to all our tran&s;|actions, or at lea&s;t will &s;o complicate our politicks, that we &s;hall our&s;elves be inextricably entangled in them.</P>
<P>I have Toulon in my eye. It was with infinite &s;orrow I heard that in taking the king of France's fleet in tru&s;t, we in&s;tantly unrigged and di&s;ma&s;ted the &s;hips, in&s;tead of keeping them in a condition to e&s;cape in ca&s;e of di&s;a&s;ter, and in order to fulfil our tru&s;t, that is, to hold them for the u&s;e of the owner, and, in the mean time, to employ them for our common &s;ervice.

But the Athenians ought not to be better than the Engli&s;h, or Mr. Pitt le&s;s virtuous than Ari&s;tides.</P>
<P>Are we then &s;o poor in re&s;ources that we can do no better with eighteen or twenty &s;hips of the line than to burn them?

It may be &s;aid that the&s;e French officers would take them for the King of France, and that they would not be in our power. Be it &s;o. The i&s;lands would not be ours, but they would not be jacobinized. This is how|ever a thing impo&s;&s;ible&punc; They mu&s;t in effect and &s;ub&s;tance be ours.

But the only way of keeping that jealous and di&s;cordant ma&s;s from tearing its component parts to pieces, and hazarding the lo&s;s of the whole, is to put the place into the nominal government of the regent, his officers being approved by us. This, I &s;ay, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for a poi&s;e among&s;t our&s;elves. Otherwi&s;e is it to be believed that the Spaniards, who hold that place with us in a &s;ort of part|ner&s;hip contrary to our mutual intere&s;t, will &s;ee us ab&s;olute ma&s;ters of the Mediterranean, with Gibraltar on one &s;ide, and Toulon on the other, with a quiet and compo&s;ed mind, whil&s;t we do little le&s;s than declare that we are to take the whole We&s;t Indies into our hands, leaving the va&s;t, unwieldy, and feeble body of the Spani&s;h dominions in that part of the world, ab&s;olutely at our mercy, without
<PB N="169" REF="203">
any power to balance us in the &s;malle&s;t degree. Nothing is &s;o fatal to a nation as an extreme of &s;elf-partiality, and the total want of con&s;ideration of what others will naturally hope or &s;ear. Spain mu&s;t think &s;he &s;ees, that we are taking advantage of the confu&s;ions which reign in France, to di&s;able that country, and of cour&s;e every country from affording her protection, and in the end to turn the Spani&s;h Monarchy into a province. If &s;he &s;aw things in a proper point of light, to be &s;ure, &s;he would not con&s;ider any other plan of politicks as of the lea&s;t moment in compari&s;on of the ex|tinction of jacobini&s;m. But her mini&s;ters (to &s;ay the be&s;t of them) are vulgar politicians. It is no wonder that they &s;hould po&s;tpone this great point, or balance it, by con&s;iderations of the common politicks, that is, the que&s;tions of power between <HI>&s;tate and &s;tate.</HI> If we manife&s;tly endeavour to de|&s;troy the balance, e&s;pecially the maritime and commercial balance, both in Europe and the We&s;t Indies, (the latter their &s;ore and vulnerable part) from fear of what France may do for Spain here|after, is it to be wondered, that Spain, infinitely weaker than we are, (weaker indeed that &s;uch a ma&s;s of empire ever was,) &s;hould feel the &s;ame fears from our uncontroled power, that we give way to our&s;elves from a &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;urrection of the antient power of France under a Monarchy? It &s;ignifies nothing whether we are wrong or right
<PB N="170" REF="204">
in the ab&s;tract; but in re&s;pect to our relation to Spain, with &s;uch principles followed up in practice, it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible that any cordial alliance can &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the two nations. If Spain goes, Naples will &s;peedily follow. Pru&s;&s;ia is quite certain, and thinks of nothing but making a market of the pre&s;ent confu&s;ions. Italy is broken and divided; Switzerland is jacobinized, I am afraid, completely. I have long &s;een with pain the pro|gre&s;s of French principles in that country. Things cannot go on upon the pre&s;ent bottom. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Toulon, which, well managed, might be of the greate&s;t advantage, will be the greate&s;t misfortune that ever happened to this nation. The more we multiply troops there, the more we &s;hall multiply cau&s;es and means of quarrel among&s;t our|&s;elves. I know but one way of avoiding it, which is to give a greater degree of &s;implicity to our politicks. Our &s;ituation does nece&s;&s;arily render them a good deal involved. And, to this evil, in|&s;tead of increa&s;ing it, we ought to apply all the remedies in our power.</P>
<P>See what is, in that place, the con&s;equence (to &s;ay nothing of every other) of this complexity. Toulon has, as it were, two gates, an Engli&s;h, and a Spani&s;h. The Engli&s;h gate is, by our policy, fa&s;t barred again&s;t the entrance of any Royali&s;ts. The Spaniards open theirs, I fear, upon no fixed principle, and with very little judgment. By
<PB N="171" REF="205">
means, however, of this fooli&s;h, mean, and jealous policy on our &s;ide, all the Royali&s;ts whom the Engli&s;h might &s;elect as mo&s;t practicable, and mo&s;t &s;ub&s;ervient to hone&s;t views, are totally excluded. Of tho&s;e admitted, the Spaniards are ma&s;ters. As to the inhabitants they are a ne&s;t of Jacobins which is delivered into our hands, not from principle, but from fear. The inhabitants of Toulon may be de&s;cribed in few words. It is <HI>differtum nautis, cauponibus atque malignis.</HI> The re&s;t of the &s;eaports are of the &s;ame de&s;cription.</P>
<P>Another thing which I cannot account for is, the &s;ending for the Bi&s;hop of Toulon, and afterwards forbidding his entrance. This is as directly con|trary to the declaration, as it is to the practice of the allied powers. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia did better. When he took Verdun, he actually re-in&s;tated the Bi&s;hop and his Chapter. When he thought he &s;hould be the ma&s;ter of Chalons, he called the bi&s;hop from Flanders, to put him into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The Au&s;trians have re&s;tored the clergy wherever they obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. We have propo&s;ed to re&s;tore Religion as well as Monarchy; and in Toulon we have re&s;tored neither the one nor the other. It is very likely that the Jacobin Sans-Culottes, or &s;ome of them, objected to this mea&s;ure, who rather chu&s;e to have the athei&s;tick buffoons of clergy they have got to &s;port with, till they are
<PB N="172" REF="206">
ready to come forward, with the re&s;t of their worthy brethren, in Paris and other places, to de|clare that they are a &s;et of impo&s;tors, that they never believed in God, and never will preach any &s;ort of religion. If we give way to our Jacobins in this point, it is fully and fairly putting the go|vernment, civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, not in the King of France, to whom, as the protector and go|vernor, and in &s;ub&s;tance the head of the Gallican Church, the nomination to the bi&s;hopricks belonged, and who made the bi&s;hop of Toulon; it does not leave it with him, or even in the hands of the King of England, or the King of Spain; but in the ba&s;e&s;t Jacobins of a low &s;ea-port, to exerci&s;e, <HI>pro tempore,</HI> the &s;overeignty. If this point of religion is thus given up, the grand in&s;trument for reclaiming France is abandoned. We cannot, if we would, delude our&s;elves about the true &s;tate of this dread|ful conte&s;t. <HI>It is a religious war.</HI> It includes in its object undoubtedly every other intere&s;t of &s;o|ciety as well as this; but this is the principal and leading feature. It is through this de&s;truction of religion that our enemies propo&s;e the accompli&s;h|ment of all their other views. The French Revo|lution, impious at once and fanatical, had no other plan for dome&s;tick power and foreign empire. Look at all the proceedings of the National A&s;&s;embly from the fir&s;t day of declaring it&s;elf &s;uch in the year 1789, to this very hour, and you will find full
<PB N="173" REF="207">
half of their bu&s;ine&s;s to be directly on this &s;ubject. In fact it is the &s;pirit of the whole. The religious &s;y&s;tem, called the Con&s;titutional Church, was on the face of the whole proceeding &s;et up only as a mere temporary amu&s;ement to the people, and &s;o con&s;tantly &s;tated in all their conver&s;ations, till the time &s;hould come, when they might with &s;afety ca&s;t off the very appearance of all religion what&s;oever, and per&s;ecute chri&s;tianity throughout Europe with fire and &s;word. The Con&s;titutional Clergy are not the Mini&s;ters of any religion: they are the agents and in&s;truments of this horrible con&s;piracy again&s;t all morals. It was from a &s;en&s;e of this, that in the Engli&s;h Addition to the Articles propo&s;ed at St. Domingo, tolerating all Religions, we very wi&s;ely refu&s;ed to &s;uffer that kind of traitors and buffoons.</P>
<P>This religious war is not a controver&s;y between &s;ect and &s;ect as formerly, but a war again&s;t all &s;ects and all religions. The que&s;tion is not whether you are to overturn the catholick, to &s;et up the prote&s;tant. Such an idea in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world is too contemptible. Our bu&s;ine&s;s is to leave to the &s;chools the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the contro|verted points, abating as much as we can the acrimony of di&s;putants on all &s;ides. It is for chri&s;tian State&s;men, as the world is now circum&s;tanced, to &s;ecure their common Ba&s;is, and not to ri&s;que the &s;ubver&s;ion of the whole Fabrick by pur&s;uing the&s;e
<PB N="174" REF="208">
di&s;tinctions with an ill-timed zeal. We have in the pre&s;ent grand Alliance, all modes of Govern|ment as well as all modes of religion. In Govern|ment, we mean to re&s;tore that which, notwith&s;tand|ing our diver&s;ity of forms we are all agreed in, as fundamental in Government. The &s;ame principle ought to guide us in the religious part; conforming the mode, not to our particular ideas (for in that point we have no ideas in common) but to what will be&s;t promote the great general ends of the Alliance. As State&s;men we are to &s;ee which of tho&s;e modes be&s;t &s;uits with the intere&s;ts of &s;uch a Commonwealth as we wi&s;h to &s;ecure and promote. There can be no doubt, but that the catholick religion, which is fundamentally the religion of France, mu&s;t go with the Monarchy of France; we know that the Monarchy did not &s;urvive the Hierarchy, no not even in appearance, for many months; in &s;ub&s;tance, not for a &s;ingle hour. As little can it exi&s;t in future, if that pillar is taken away, or even &s;hattered and impaired.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould plea&s;e God to give to the Allies the means of re&s;toring peace and order in that focus of war and confu&s;ion, I would, as I &s;aid in the beginning of this Memorial, fir&s;t replace the whole of the old Clergy: becau&s;e we have proof more than &s;ufficient, that whether they err or not in the &s;chola&s;tick di&s;putes with us, they are not tainted
<PB N="175" REF="209">
with athei&s;m, the great political evil of the time. I hope I need not apologize for this phra&s;e, as if I thought religion nothing but policy; it is far from my thoughts; and I hope it is not to be inferred from my expre&s;&s;ions. But in the light of policy alone I am here con&s;idering the que&s;tion. I &s;peak of policy too in a large light; in which large light, policy too is a &s;acred thing.</P>
<P>There are many, perhaps half a million or more, calling them&s;elves prote&s;tants, in the &s;outh of France, and in other of the provinces. Some rai&s;e them to a much greater number, but I think this nearer to the mark. I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that they have behaved &s;hockingly &s;ince the very be|ginning of this rebellion, and have been uniformly concerned in its wor&s;t and mo&s;t atrocious acts. Their Clergy are ju&s;t the &s;ame athei&s;ts with tho&s;e of the Con&s;titutional catholicks; but &s;till more wicked and daring. Three of their number have met, from their Republican a&s;&s;ociates, the reward of their crimes.</P>
<P>As the antient catholick religion is to be re&s;tored for the body of France, the antient calvini&s;tick religion ought to be re&s;tored for the prote&s;tants with every kind of protection and privilege. But not one Mini&s;ter concerned in this rebellion ought to be &s;uffered among&s;t them. If they have not
<PB N="176" REF="210">
Clergy of their own, men well recommended as untainted with Jacobini&s;m, by the &s;ynods of tho&s;e places where calvini&s;m prevails and French is &s;poken, ought to be &s;ought. Many &s;uch there are. The pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline ought, in my opinion, to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in its vigour, and the people pro|fe&s;&s;ing it ought to be bound to its maintenance. No man, under the fal&s;e and hypocritical pretence of liberty of con&s;cience, ought to be &s;uffered to have no con&s;cience at all. The King's com|mi&s;&s;ioner ought al&s;o to &s;it in their &s;ynods as before the revocation of the Edict of Nantz. I am con|&s;cious, that this di&s;cipline di&s;po&s;es men to Repub|licani&s;m: but it is &s;till a di&s;cipline, and it is a cure, (&s;uch as it is) for the perver&s;e and undi&s;ciplined habits which for &s;ome time have prevailed. Re|publicani&s;m repre&s;&s;ed may have its u&s;e in the com|po&s;ition of a State. In&s;pection may be practicable, and re&s;pon&s;ibility in the teachers and elders may be e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;uch an Hierarchy as the pre&s;byterian. For a time like ours, it is a great point gained, that people &s;hould be taught to meet, to combine, and to be cla&s;&s;ed and arrayed in &s;ome other way than in Clubs of Jacobins. If it be not the be&s;t mode of prote&s;tanti&s;m under a Monarchy, it is &s;till an orderly chri&s;tian church, orthodox in the fundamentals, and what is to our point, capable enough of rendering men u&s;eful citizens. It was the impolitick abolition of their di&s;cipline which
<PB N="177" REF="211">
expo&s;ed them to the wild opinions and conduct, that have prevailed among&s;t the Hugonots. The toleration in 1787 was owing to the good di&s;po|&s;ition of the late King; but it was modified by the profligate folly of his athei&s;tick Mini&s;ter the Cardinal de Lomenie. This mi&s;chievous Mini&s;ter did not follow, in the Edict of toleration, the wi&s;dom of the Edict of Nantz. But his toleration was granted to <HI>Non-Catholicks</HI>&mdash;a dangerous word, which might &s;ignify any thing, and was but too expre&s;&s;ive of a fatal indifference with regard to all piety. I &s;peak for my&s;elf: I do not wi&s;h any man to be converted from his &s;ect. The di&s;tinctions which we have reformed from animo&s;ity to emulation, may be even u&s;eful to the cau&s;e of religion. By &s;ome moderate contention they keep alive zeal. Whereas people who change, except under &s;trong convic|tion (a thing now rather rare) the religion of their early prejudices, e&s;pecially if the conver&s;ion is brought about by any political machine, are very apt to degenerate into indifference, laxity, and often downright athei&s;m.</P>
<P>Another political que&s;tion ari&s;es about the mode of Government which ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. I think the proclamation (which I read before I had proceeded far in this Memorial,) puts it on the be&s;t footing, by po&s;tponing that arrangement to a time of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="212">
When our politicks lead us to enterprize a great, and almo&s;t total political revolution in Europe, we ought to look &s;eriou&s;ly into the con&s;equences of what we are about to do. Some eminent per&s;ons di&s;cover an apprehen&s;ion that the Monarchy, if re&s;tored in France, may be re&s;tored in too great &s;trength for the liberty and happine&s;s of the natives, and for the tranquillity of other States. They are therefore of opinion that terms ought to be made for the modification of that Monarchy. They are per&s;ons too con&s;iderable from the powers of their mind, and from their &s;ituation, as well as from the real re&s;pect I have for them, who &s;eem to entertain the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, to let me pa&s;s them by un|noticed.</P>
<P>As to the power of France, as a State, and in its exteriour relations, I confe&s;s my fears are on the part of its extreme reduction. There is un|doubtedly &s;omething in the vicinity of France, which makes it naturally and properly an object of our watchfulne&s;s and jealou&s;y, whatever form its Government may take. But the difference is great between a plan for our own &s;ecurity, and a &s;cheme for the utter de&s;truction of France. If there were no other countries in the political map but the&s;e two, I admit that policy might ju&s;tify a wi&s;h to lower our neighbour to a &s;tandard which would even render her in &s;ome mea&s;ure, if not wholly,
<PB N="179" REF="213">
our dependent. But the &s;y&s;tem of Europe is ex|ten&s;ive and extremely complex. However formi|dable to us as taken in this one relation, France is not equally dreadful to all other States. On the contrary, my clear opinion is, that the Liberties of Europe cannot po&s;&s;ibly be pre&s;erved, but by her remaining a very great and preponderating power. The de&s;ign at pre&s;ent evidently pur&s;ued by the combined Potentates, or of the two who lead, is totally to de&s;troy her as &s;uch a Power. For Great Britain re&s;olves that &s;he &s;hall have no Colonies, no Commerce, and no Marine. Au&s;tria means to take away the whole frontier from the borders of Switzerland, to Dunkirk. It is their plan al&s;o to render the interiour Government lax and feeble, by pre&s;cribing by force of the arms of rival and jealous nations, and without con&s;ulting the natural intere&s;ts of the kingdom; &s;uch arrange|ments as in the actual &s;tate of Jacobini&s;m in France, and the un&s;ettled &s;tate in which property mu&s;t re|main for a long time, will inevitably produce &s;uch di&s;traction and debility in Government, as to reduce it to nothing, or to throw it back into its old con|fu&s;ion. One cannot conceive &s;o frightful a &s;tate of a Nation. A maritime country, without a ma|rine, and without commerce; a continental country without a frontier, and for a thou&s;and miles &s;ur|rounded with powerful, warlike, and ambitious neighbours! It is po&s;&s;ible, that &s;he might &s;ubmit
<PB N="180" REF="214">
to lo&s;e her commerce and her colonies; her &s;ecurity &s;he never can abandon. If, contrary to all expectations, under &s;uch a di&s;graced and im|potent Government, any energy &s;hould remain in that country, &s;he will make every e&s;&s;ort to recover her &s;ecurity, which will involve Europe for a cen|tury in war and blood. What has it co&s;t to France to make that frontier? What will it co&s;t to re|cover it? Au&s;tria thinks that without a Frontier &s;he cannot &s;ecure the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> But without her Frontier France cannot &s;ecure <HI>her&s;elf.</HI> Au&s;tria has been however &s;ecure for an hundred years in tho&s;e very Netherlands, and has never been di&s;po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of them by the chance of war, without a moral certainty of receiving them again on the re&s;toration of peace. Her late dangers have ari&s;en not from the power or ambition of the King of France. They aro&s;e from her own ill policy, which di&s;mantled all her towns, and di&s;contented all her &s;ubjects by Jacobinical innovations. She di&s;mantles her own towns, and then &s;ays, Give me the Frontier of France. But let us depend upon it, whatever tends, under the name of &s;ecu|rity, to aggrandize Au&s;tria, will di&s;content and alarm Pru&s;&s;ia. Such a length of Frontier on the &s;ide of France, &s;eparated from it&s;elf, and &s;epa|rated from the ma&s;s of the Au&s;trian country, will be weak, unle&s;s connected at the expence of the Elector of Bavaria (the Elector Palatine) and
<PB N="181" REF="215">
other le&s;&s;er Princes, or by &s;uch exchanges as will again convul&s;e the Empire.</P>
<P>Take it the other way, and let us &s;uppo&s;e that France &s;o broken in &s;pirit as to be content to re|main naked and defencele&s;s by &s;ea and by land, is &s;uch a country no prey? Have other Nations no views? Is Poland the only country of which it is worth while to make a partition? We cannot be &s;o childi&s;h as to imagine, that ambition is local, and that no others can be infected with it but tho&s;e who rule within certain parallels of latitude and longitude? In this way I hold war equally certain. But I can conceive that both the&s;e principles may operate, ambition on the part of Au&s;tria, to cut more and more from France, and French impa|tience under her degraded and un&s;afe condition. In &s;uch a Conte&s;t will the other Powers &s;tand by? Will not Pru&s;&s;ia call for indemnity as well as Au&s;tria and England? Is &s;he &s;atisfied with her gains in Poland? By no means. Germany mu&s;t pay; or we &s;hall infallibly &s;ee Pru&s;&s;ia leagued with France and Spain, and po&s;&s;ibly with other Powers for the reduction of Au&s;tria; and &s;uch may be the &s;itua|tion of things, that it will not be &s;o ea&s;y to decide what part England may take in &s;uch a Conte&s;t.</P>
<P>I am well aware how invidious a ta&s;k it is to oppo&s;e any thing which tends to the apparent
<PB N="182" REF="216">
aggrandizement of our own country. But I think no country can be aggrandized whil&s;t France is Jacobini&s;ed. This po&s;t removed, it will be a &s;erious que&s;tion how far her further reduction will contribute to the general &s;afety which I always con|&s;ider as included. Among precautions again&s;t am|bition, it may not be ami&s;s to take one precaution again&s;t our <HI>own.</HI> I mu&s;t fairly &s;ay, I dread our <HI>own</HI> power and our <HI>own</HI> ambition; I dread our being too much dreaded. It is ridiculous to &s;ay we are not men; and that, as men, we &s;hall never wi&s;h to aggrandize our&s;elves in &s;ome way or other. Can we &s;ay, that even at this very hour we are not invidiou&s;ly aggrandized? We are already in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of almo&s;t all the commerce of the world. Our Empire in India is an awful thing. If we &s;hould come to be in a condition not only to have all this a&s;cendant in commerce, but to be ab&s;o|lutely able, without the lea&s;t controul, to hold the commerce of all other Nations totally dependent upon our good plea&s;ure, we may &s;ay that we &s;hall not abu&s;e this a&s;toni&s;hing, and hitherto unheard of power. But every other Nation will think we &s;hall abu&s;e it. It is impo&s;&s;ible but that &s;ooner or later, this &s;tate of things mu&s;t produce a com|bination again&s;t us which may end in our ruin.</P>
<P>As to France, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that for a long time &s;he has been &s;tationary. She has, during this
<PB N="183" REF="217">
whole century, obtained far le&s;s by conque&s;t or negotiation than any of the three great continental Powers. Some part of Lorraine excepted, I re|collect nothing &s;he has gained; no not a village. In truth, this Lorraine acqui&s;ition does little more than &s;ecure her Barrier. In effect and &s;ub&s;tance it was her own before.</P>
<P>However that may be, I con&s;ider the&s;e things at pre&s;ent chiefly in one point of view, as ob&s;tructions to the war on Jacobini&s;m, which <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;tand as long as the Powers think its extirpation but a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> object, and think of taking advantage under the name of <HI>indemnity</HI> and <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> to make war upon the whole Nation of France Royal, and Jacobin, for the aggrandizement of the Allies on the ordi|nary principles of intere&s;t, as if no Jacobini&s;m exi&s;ted in the world.</P>
<P>So far is France from being formidable to its neighbours for its dome&s;tick &s;trength, that I conceive it will be as much as all its neighbours can do by a &s;teady guarantee, to keep that Monarchy at all upon its ba&s;is. It will be their bu&s;ine&s;s to nur&s;e France, not to exhau&s;t it. France, &s;uch as it is, s indeed highly formidable. Not formidable, however, as a great Republick; but as the mo&s;t dreadful gang of robbers and murderers that ever was embodied. But this di&s;tempered &s;trength of
<PB N="184" REF="218">
France, will be the cau&s;e of proportionable weak|ne&s;s on its recovery. Never was a country &s;o com|pletely ruined; and they who calculate the re&s;ur|rection of her power by former examples, have not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered what is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things. Without detailing the inventory of what organs of Government have been de&s;troyed, together with the very materials of which alone they can be recompo&s;ed, I wi&s;h it to be con&s;idered what an opero&s;e affair the whole &s;y&s;tem of taxa|tion is in the old &s;tates of Europe. It is &s;uch as never could be made but in a long cour&s;e of years. In France, all taxes are aboli&s;hed. The pre&s;ent powers re&s;ort to the capital; and to the capital in kind. But a &s;avage undi&s;ciplined people &s;uffer a <HI>rebbery</HI> with more patience than an <HI>impo&s;t.</HI> The former is in their habits and their di&s;po&s;itions. They con&s;ider it as tran&s;ient, and as what, in their turn, they may exerci&s;e. But the terrours of the pre&s;ent power are &s;uch as no regular Government can po&s;&s;ibly employ. They who enter into France do not &s;ucceed to <HI>their</HI> re&s;ources. They have not a &s;y&s;tem to reform, but a &s;y&s;tem to begin. The whole e&s;tate of Government is to be re-acquired.</P>
<P>What difficulties this will meet with in a coun|try exhau&s;ted by the taking of the capital, and among a people, in a manner new principled, trained, and actually di&s;ciplined to anarchy, rebel|lion,

di&s;order, and impiety, may be conceived by tho&s;e who know what Jacobin France is, and who may have occupied them&s;elves by revolving in their thoughts, what they were to do if it fell to their lot to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the affairs of France. What &s;upport, or what limitations the re&s;tored Monarchy mu&s;t have, may be a doubt, or how it will pitch and &s;ettle at la&s;t: But one thing I con|ceive to be far beyond a doubt: that the &s;ettle|ment cannot be immediate; but that it mu&s;t be preceded by &s;ome &s;ort of power, equal at lea&s;t in vigour, vigilance, promptitude and deci&s;ion to a military Government. For &s;uch a <HI>preparatery</HI> Government, no &s;low-paced, methodical, formal, Lawyer-like &s;y&s;tem, &s;till le&s;s that of a &s;hewy, &s;uperficial, trifling, intriguing Court, guided by cabals of ladies, or of men like ladies; lea&s;t of all, a philo|&s;ophic, theoretic, di&s;putatious &s;chool of &s;ophi&s;try. None of the&s;e ever will, or ever can lay the foun|dations of an order that can la&s;t. Whoever claims a right by birth to govern there, mu&s;t find in his brea&s;t, or mu&s;t conjure up in it, an energy not to be expected, perhaps not always to be wi&s;hed for, in well ordered States. The lawful Prince mu&s;t have, in every thing but crime, the character of an u&s;urper. He is gone, if he imagines him&s;elf the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a throne. He is to contend for it as much after an apparent conque&s;t as before. His ta&s;k is to win it; he mu&s;t leave po&s;terity to
<PB N="186" REF="220">
enjoy and to adorn it. No velvet cu&s;hions for him. He is to be always (I &s;peak nearly to the letter) on hor&s;eback. This opinion is the re&s;ult of much patient thinking on the &s;ubject, which I conceive no event is likely to alter.</P>
<P>A valuable friend of mine, who I hope will con|duct the&s;e affairs &s;o far as they fall to his &s;hare, with great ability, a&s;ked me what I thought of acts of general indemnity and oblivion, as a means of &s;ettling France, and reconciling it to Monarchy. Before I venture upon any opinion of my own in this matter, I totally di&s;claim the interference of foreign powers in a bu&s;ine&s;s that properly be|longs to the Government which we have declared legal. That Government is likely to be the be&s;t judge of what is to be done towards the &s;ecurity of that kingdom, which it is their duty and their intere&s;t to provide for by &s;uch mea&s;ures of ju&s;tice or of lenity, as at the time they &s;hould find be&s;t. But if we weaken it, not only by arbitrary limita|tions of our own, but pre&s;erve &s;uch per&s;ons in it as are di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;turb its future peace, as they have its pa&s;t, I do not know how a more direct declaration can be made of a di&s;po&s;ition to per|petual ho&s;tility again&s;t a Government. The per|&s;ons &s;aved from the ju&s;tice of the native Magi&s;|trate, by foreign authority, will owe nothing to his clemency. He will, and mu&s;t, look to tho&s;e to
<PB N="187" REF="221">
whom he is indebted for the power he has of di&s;|pen&s;ing it. A Jacobin faction, con&s;tantly fo&s;tered with the nouri&s;hment of foreign protection, will be kept alive.</P>
<P>This de&s;ire of &s;ecuring the &s;afety of the actors in the pre&s;ent &s;cene is owing to more laudable motives. Mini&s;ters have been made to con&s;ider the brothers of the late merciful King, and the Nobility of France, who have been faithful to their honor and duty, as a &s;et of inexorable and remor&s;ele&s;s tyrants. How this notion has been infu&s;ed into them, I cannot be quite certain. I am &s;ure it is not ju&s;tified by any thing they have done. Never were the two Princes guilty, in the day of their power, of a &s;ingle hard or ill-natured act. No one in&s;tance of cruelty on the part of the Gen|tlemen ever came to my ears. It is true that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Jacobins, (the natives have not thought of it) as an excu&s;e for their infernal &s;y&s;tem of mur|der, have &s;o repre&s;ented them. It is on this prin|ciple that the ma&s;&s;acres in the month of Sep|tember 1792 were ju&s;tified by a writer in the Morning Chronicle. <HI>He</HI> &s;ays, indeed, that <Q REND="inline">"the whole French nation is to be given up to the hands of an irritated and revengeful Noble&s;&s;e:"</Q>&mdash;and judging of others by him&s;elf and his brethren, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Whoever &s;ucceeds in a civil war, will be cruel. But here the emigrants flying to revenge
<PB N="188" REF="222">
in the cars of military victory, will almo&s;t in&s;atiably call for their victims and their booty; and a body of emigrant traitors were attending the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the Duke of Brun&s;wick, to &s;ugge&s;t the mo&s;t &s;anguinary coun&s;els."</Q> So &s;ays this wicked Jacobin; but &s;o cannot &s;ay the King of Pru&s;&s;ia nor the Duke of Brun&s;wick, who never did receive any &s;anguinary council; nor did the King's bro|thers, or that great body of Gentlemen who at|tended tho&s;e Princes, commit one &s;ingle cruel ac|tion, or hurt the per&s;on or property of one indi|vidual. It would be right to quote the in&s;tance. It is like the military luxury attributed to the&s;e unfortunate &s;ufferers in our common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Princes had &s;hewn a tyrannic di&s;po&s;ition, it would be much to be lamented. We have no others to govern France. If we &s;creened the body of murderers from their ju&s;tice, we &s;hould only leave the innocent in future to the mercy of men of fierce and &s;anguinary di&s;po&s;itions, of which in &s;pite of all our intermeddling in their Con&s;titution, we could not prevent the effects. But as we have much more rea&s;on to fear their feeble lenity than any blameable rigour, we ought, in my opinion, to leave the matter to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>If however I were a&s;ked to give an advice merely as &s;uch&mdash;here are my ideas. I am not for
<PB N="189" REF="223">
a total indemnity, nor a general puni&s;hment. And fir&s;t, the body and ma&s;s of the people never ought to be treated as criminal. They may become an object of more or le&s;s con&s;tant watchfulne&s;s and &s;u&s;picion, as their pre&s;ervation may be&s;t require, but they can never become an object of puni&s;h|ment. This is one of the few fundamental and unalterable principles of politicks.</P>
<P>To puni&s;h them capitally would be to make ma&s;&s;acres. Ma&s;&s;acres only increa&s;e the ferocity of men, and teach them to regard their own lives and tho&s;e of others as of little value; whereas the great policy of Government is to teach the people to think both of great importance in the eyes of God and the State, and never to be &s;acrificed or even hazarded to gratify their pa&s;&s;ions, or for any thing but the duties pre&s;cribed by the rules of morality, and under the direction of public law and public authority. To puni&s;h them with le&s;&s;er penalties would be to debilitate the commonwealth, and make the nation mi&s;erable, which it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of Government to render happy and flou|ri&s;hing.</P>
<P>As to crimes too, I would draw a &s;trong line of limitation. For no one offence, <HI>politically an offence of rebellion,</HI> by council, contrivance, per&s;ua&s;ion or compul&s;ion, for none properly a <HI>military offence of</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="224">
<HI>rebellion,</HI> or any thing done by open ho&s;tility in the field, &s;hould any man at all be called in que&s;|tion; becau&s;e &s;uch &s;eems to be the proper and natural death of civil di&s;&s;entions. The offences of war are obliterated by peace.</P>
<P>Another cla&s;s will of cour&s;e be included in the indemnity, namely, all tho&s;e who by their activity in re&s;toring lawful Government &s;hall obliterate their offences. The offence previou&s;ly known, the acceptance of &s;ervice is a pardon for crimes. I fear that this cla&s;s of men will not be very nu|merous.</P>
<P>So far as to indemnity. But where are the objects of ju&s;tice, and of example, and of future &s;ecurity to the public peace? They are naturally pointed out, not by their having outraged political and civil laws, nor their having rebelled again&s;t the &s;tate, as a State, but by their having rebelled again&s;t the law of nature, and outraged man, as man. In this li&s;t, all the regicides in general, all tho&s;e who laid &s;acrilegious hands on the King, who without any thing in their own rebellious mi&s;&s;ion to the convention to ju&s;tify them, brought him to his trial and unanimou&s;ly voted him guilty; all tho&s;e who had a &s;hare in the cruel murder of the Queen, and the dete&s;table proceedings with regard to the young King, and the unhappy Prin|ce&s;&s;es;
<PB N="191" REF="225">
all tho&s;e who committed cold-blooded murder any where, and particularly in their revo|lutionary tribunals, where every idea of natural ju&s;tice and of their own declared Rights of Man, have been trod under foot with the mo&s;t in&s;olent mockery; all men concerned in the burning and demolition of hou&s;es or churches, with audacious and marked acts of &s;acrilege and &s;corns offered to religion; in general, all the leaders of Jacobin Clubs;&mdash;not one of the&s;e &s;hould e&s;cape a puni&s;h|ment &s;uitable to the nature, quality and degree of their offence, by a &s;teady but a mea&s;ured ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, no man ought to be &s;ubject to any penalty, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, but by a trial according to the cour&s;e of law, carried on with all that caution and deliberation which has been u&s;ed in the be&s;t times and precedents of the French juri&s;prudence, the criminal law of which country, faulty to be &s;ure in &s;ome particulars, was highly landable and tender of the lives of men. In re&s;toring order and ju&s;tice, every thing like re|taliation, ought to be religiou&s;ly avoided; and an example ought to be &s;et of a total alienation from the Jacobin proceedings in their accur&s;ed revolu|tionary tribunals. Every thing like lumping men in ma&s;&s;es, and of forming tables of pro&s;cription ought to be avoided.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="226">
In all the&s;e puni&s;hments, any thing which can be alledged in mitigation of the offence &s;hould be fully con&s;idered. Mercy is not a thing oppo&s;ed to ju&s;tice. It is an e&s;&s;ential part of it; as nece&s;&s;ary in criminal ca&s;es, as in civil affairs equity is to law. It is only for the Jacobins never to pardon. They have not done it in a &s;ingle in&s;tance. A council of mercy ought therefore to be appointed, with powers to report on each ca&s;e, to &s;often the penalty, or entirely to remit it, according to cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>With the&s;e precautions, the very fir&s;t founda|tion of &s;ettlement mu&s;t be to call to a &s;trict account tho&s;e bloody and mercile&s;s offenders. With|out it Government cannot &s;tand a year. People little con&s;ider the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of getting tho&s;e who having emerged from very low, &s;ome from the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es, of &s;ociety, have exerci&s;ed a power &s;o high, and with &s;uch unrelenting and bloody a rage, quietly to fall back into their old ranks, and be|come humble, peaceable, laborious and u&s;eful members of &s;ociety. It never can be. On the other hand is it to be believed, that any worthy and virtuous &s;ubject, re&s;tored to the ruins of his hou&s;e, will with patience &s;ee the cold-blooded murderer of his father, mother, wife, or children, or perhaps all of the&s;e relations (&s;uch things have been) no&s;e him in his own village, and in&s;ult him
<PB N="193" REF="227">
with the riches acquired from the plunder of his goods, ready again to head a Jacobin Faction to attack his life? He is unworthy of the name of man who would &s;uffer it. It is unworthy of the name of a Government, which taking ju&s;tice out of the private hand, will not exerci&s;e it for the injured by the public arm.</P>
<P>I know it &s;ounds plau&s;ible, and is readily adopted by tho&s;e who have little &s;ympathy with the &s;uffer|ings of others, to wi&s;h to jumble the innocent and guilty into one ma&s;s, by a general indemnity. This cruel indifference dignifies it&s;elf with the name of humanity.</P>
<P>It is extraordinary that as the wicked arts of this regicide and tyrannous faction increa&s;e in number, variety, and atrocity, the de&s;ire of puni&s;hing them becomes more and more faint, and the talk of an indemnity towards them, every day &s;tronger and &s;tronger. Our ideas of ju&s;tice appear to be fairly conquered and overpowered by guilt when it is grown gigantick. It is not the point of view in which we are in the habit of viewing guilt. The crimes we every day puni&s;h are really below the penalties we inflict. The criminals are ob&s;cure and feeble. This is the view in which we &s;ee or|dinary crimes and criminals. But when guilt is &s;een, though but for a time, to be furni&s;hed with
<PB N="194" REF="228">
the arms and to be inve&s;ted with the robes of power, it &s;eems to a&s;&s;ume another nature, and to get, as it were, out of our juri&s;diction. This I fear is the ca&s;e with many. But there is another cau&s;e full as powerful towards this &s;ecurity to enor|mous guilt, the de&s;ire which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es people who have once obtained power, to enjoy it at their ea&s;e. It is not humanity, but lazine&s;s and inertne&s;s of mind which produces the de&s;ire of this kind of in|demnities. This de&s;cription of men love general and &s;hort methods. If they puni&s;h, they make a promi&s;cuous ma&s;&s;acre; If they &s;pare, they make a general act of oblivion. This is a want of di&s;po&s;i|tion to proceed laboriou&s;ly according to the ca&s;es, and according to the rules and principles of ju&s;tice on each ca&s;e; a want of di&s;po&s;ition to a&s;&s;ort criminals, to di&s;criminate the degrees and modes of guilt, to &s;eparate accomplices from principals, leaders from followers, &s;educers from the &s;educed, and then by following the &s;ame principles in the &s;ame detail, to cla&s;s puni&s;hments, and to fit them to the nature and kind of the delinquency. If that were once attempted, we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee that the ta&s;k was neither infinite, nor the execution cruel. There would be deaths, but for the number of criminals, and the extent of France, not many. There would be ca&s;es of tran&s;portation; ca&s;es of labour to re|&s;tore what has been wickedly de&s;troyed; ca&s;es of impri&s;onment, and ca&s;es of mere exile. But be
<PB N="195" REF="229">
this as it may, I am &s;ure that if ju&s;tice is not done there, there can be neither peace or ju&s;tice there, nor in any part of Europe.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory is re&s;orted to for other acts of indem|nity in other times. The Princes are de&s;ired to look back to Henry the Fourth. We are de&s;ired to look to the Re&s;toration of King Charles. The&s;e things, in my opinion, have no re&s;emblance what&s;oever. They were ca&s;es of a civil war; in France more ferocious, in Eng|land more moderate than common. In neither country were the orders of &s;ociety &s;ubverted; religion and morality de&s;troyed on principle, or property totally annihilated In England the Go|vernment of Cromwell was to be &s;ure &s;omewhat rigid, but for a new power, no &s;avage tyranny. The country was nearly as well in his hands as in tho&s;e of Charles the Second, and in &s;ome points much better. The laws in general had their cour&s;e, and were admirably admini&s;tered. The King did not in reality grant an act of in|demnity; the prevailing power, then in a manner the nation, in effect granted an indemnity to <HI>him.</HI> The idea of a preceding Rebellion was not at all admitted in that convention and that parliament. The Regicides were a common enemy, and as &s;uch given up.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="230">
Among the ornaments of their place which emi|nently di&s;tingui&s;h them, few people are better acquainted with the hi&s;tory of their own country than the illu&s;trious Princes now in exile: but I caution them not to be led into errour by that which has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be the guide of life. I would give the &s;ame caution to all Princes. Not that I derogate from the u&s;e of hi&s;tory. It is a great im|prover of the under&s;tanding, by &s;hewing both men and affairs in a great variety of views. From this &s;ource much political wi&s;dom may be learned; that is, may be learned as habit, not as precept; and as an exerci&s;e to &s;trengthen the mind, as furni&s;hing materials to enlarge and enrich it, not as a repertory of ca&s;es and precedents for a lawyer: if it were, a thou&s;and times better would it be that a State&s;man had never learned to read&mdash;<HI>vellem ne&s;cirent literas.</HI> This method turns their under&s;tanding from the object before them, and from the pre&s;ent exigencies of the world, to compari&s;ons with former times, of which after all, we can know very little and very imperfectly; and our guides, the hi&s;torians, who are to give us their true interpretation, are often preju|diced, often ignorant, often fonder of &s;y&s;tem than of truth. Whereas if a man with rea&s;onable good parts and natural &s;agacity, and not in the leading|&s;trings of any ma&s;ter, will look &s;teadily on the bu&s;ine&s;s before him, without being diverted by retro&s;pect and compari&s;on, he may be capable of
<PB N="197" REF="231">
forming a rea&s;onable good judgment of what is to be done. There are &s;ome fundamental points in which nature never changes&mdash;but they are few and obvious, and belong rather to morals than to poli|ticks. But &s;o far as regards political matter, the human mind and human affairs are &s;u&s;ceptible of infinite modifications, and of combinations wholly new and unlooked for. Very few, for in&s;tance, could have imagined that property, which has been taken for natural dominion, &s;hould, through the whole of a va&s;t kingdom, lo&s;e all its importance and even its influence. This is what hi&s;tory or books of &s;peculation could hardly have taught us. How many could have thought, that the mo&s;t com|plete and formidable Revolution in a great empire &s;hould be made by men of letters, not as &s;ubordi|nate in&s;truments and trumpeters of &s;edition, but as the chief contrivers and managers, and in a &s;hort time as the open admini&s;trators and &s;overeign Rulers? Who could have imagined that Athei&s;m could produce one of the mo&s;t violently operative principles of fanatici&s;m? Who could have ima|gined that, in a Commonwealth in a manner cradled in war, and in an exten&s;ive and dreadful war, military commanders &s;hould be of little or no account? That the Convention &s;hould not contain one military man of name? That admini&s;trative bodies in a &s;tate of the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, and of but a momentary duration, and compo&s;ed of men
<PB N="198" REF="232">
with not one impo&s;ing part of character, &s;hould be able to govern the country and its armies, with an authority which the mo&s;t &s;ettled Senates, and the mo&s;t re&s;pected Monarchs &s;carcely ever had in the &s;ame degree? This, for one, I confe&s;s I did not fore&s;ee, though all the re&s;t was pre&s;ent to me very early, and not out of my apprehen&s;ion even for &s;everal years.</P>
<P>I believe very few were able to enter into the effects of mere <HI>terrour,</HI> as a principle not only for the &s;upport of power in given hands or forms, but in tho&s;e things in which the &s;ounde&s;t political Spe|culators were of opinion, that the lea&s;t appearance of force would be totally de&s;tructive,&mdash;&s;uch is the the market, whether of money, provi&s;ion, or com|modities of any kind. Yet for four years we have &s;een loans made, trea&s;uries &s;upplied, and armies levied and maintained, more numerous than France ever &s;hewed in the field, by the <HI>effects of fear alone.</HI></P>
<P>Here is a &s;tate of things of which, in its totality, if hi&s;tory furni&s;hes any examples at all, they are very remote and feeble. I therefore am not &s;o ready as &s;ome are, to tax with folly or cowardice, tho&s;e who were not prepared to meet an evil of this nature. Even now, after the events, all the cau&s;es may be &s;omewhat difficult to a&s;certain. Very many are however traceable. But the&s;e things hi&s;tory and
<PB N="199" REF="233">
books of &s;peculation (as I have already &s;aid) did not teach men to fore&s;ee, and of cour&s;e to re&s;i&s;t. Now that they are no longer a matter of &s;agacity, but of experience, of recent experience, of our own experience, it would be unju&s;tifiable to go back to the records of other times, to in&s;truct us to manage what they never enabled us to fore&s;ee.</P>

<P>IT is a&s;ked if that Alliance &s;ub&s;i&s;ts with the King and the Royal Family, when by &s;ome Revolution they are deprived of their Crown? We have lately remarked, (&sect; 194) that a per&s;onal alliance expires with the reign of him who contracted it: but that is to be under&s;tood of an alliance with the &s;tate, limited as to its duration, to the reign of the contracting King. This, of which we are here &s;peaking, is of another nature. For though it binds the &s;tate, &s;ince it is bound by all the public acts of its Sovereign, it is made directly in favour of the King and his Family; it would therefore be ab&s;urd for it to terminate at the moment when they <HI>have need of it, and at an event again&s;t which it was made.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">When an alliance to pre&s;erve a King takes place.

<P><PB REF="238">
But who &s;hall judge, if the King be dethroned lawfully or by violence? An independent Nation acknowledges no judge. If the Body of the Nation declares the King deprived of his rights by the abu&s;e he has made of them, and depo&s;es him, it may ju&s;tly do it <HI>when its grievantes are well founded,</HI> and no other power has a right to cen|&s;ure it. The per&s;onal Ally of this King, ought not then to a&s;&s;i&s;t him again&s;t the Nation that has made u&s;e of its right in depo&s;ing him: if he attempts it, he injures that Nation. England declared war again&s;t Louis the XIVth, in the year 1688, for &s;upporting the intere&s;t of James the Second, who was depo&s;ed in form by the Nation. The &s;ame country declared war again&s;t him a &s;econd time, at the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, becau&s;e that Prince acknowledged the &s;on of the depo&s;ed James, under the name of James the Third. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e wherein aid may be given to a depo&s;ed King.</NOTE>In doubtful ca&s;es, and <HI>when the Body of the Nation has not pronounced, or</HI> HAS NOT PRONOUNCED FREELY, a Sovereign may naturally &s;up|port and defend an Ally, and it is then that the voluntary Law of Nations &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between different &s;tates. The party that has driven out the King, pretends to have right on its &s;ide: this unhappy King and his Ally, flatter them|&s;elves with having the &s;ame advantage, and as they have no common judge upon earth, they have no other method to take but to apply to arms to terminate the di&s;pute: they therefore engage in a formal war.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Not obliged to pur&s;ue his right be|yond a cer|tain point.</NOTE>In &s;hort, when the foreign Prince has faithfully fulfilled his engagements towards an unfortunate Monarch, when he has done in his defence, or to procure his re&s;toration, all he was obliged to perform, in virtue of the alliance; if his efforts are ineffectual, the dethroned Prince cannot require him to &s;upport an endle&s;s war in his favour, or expect that he will eternally remain the Enemy of the Nation, or of the Sovereign who has deprived him of the Throne. He mu&s;t think of peace, abandon the Ally, and con&s;ider him as having him&s;elf abandoned his right, through nece&s;&s;ity. Thus Louis XIV. was obliged to abandon James the Second, and to acknowledge K. Wil|liam, though he had at fir&s;t treated him as an U&s;urper.</P>
<P>The &s;ame que&s;tion pre&s;ents it&s;elf in real alliances, and in general, in all alliances made with the &s;tate, and not in particular with a King for the defence of his per&s;on.

If the Nation has depo&s;ed its King in form; if the people of a Republick have driven out their Magi&s;trates, and &s;et them&s;elves at liberty, or acknow|ledged the authority of an U&s;urper, either expre&s;sly or tacitly; to oppo&s;e the&s;e dome&s;tick regulations, by di&s;|puting their ju&s;tice or validity, would be to interfere in the Government of the Nation, and to do it an injury, (&s;ee &sect; 54, and following of this book). The Ally re|mains the Ally of the State, notwith&s;tanding the change that has happened in it. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e where real alli|ances may be re|nounced.</NOTE><HI>However, when this change renders the alliance u&s;ele&s;s, dangerous or di&s;agreeable, it may renounce it: for it may &s;ay, upon a good foundation, that it would not have entered into an alliance with that Nation, had it been under the pre&s;ent form of Government.</HI></P>
<P>We may &s;ay here, what we have &s;aid on a per&s;onal alliance: however ju&s;t the cau&s;e of that King may be, who is driven from the throne, either by his &s;ubjects or by a foreign u&s;urper; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Not an eternal war.</NOTE>his Allies are not obliged to &s;upport <HI>an eternal war</HI> in his favour. After having made in|effectual efforts to re&s;tore him, they mu&s;t at length give peace to their people, and come to an accommodation with the U&s;urper, and for that purpo&s;e treat with him as with a lawful Sovereign. Louis XIV. exhau&s;ted by a bloody and un&s;ucce&s;sful war, offered at Gertruidenburg to abandon his grand&s;on, whom he had placed on the throne of Spain: and when affairs had changed their appearance, Charles of Au&s;tria, the rival of Philip, &s;aw him&s;elf, in his turn, abandoned by his Allies. They grew weary of exhau&s;ting their &s;tates, in order to give him the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Crown, which they believed to be his due, but which, to all appearance, they &s;hould never be able to procure for him.</P>
