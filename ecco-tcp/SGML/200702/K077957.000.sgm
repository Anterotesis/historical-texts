<P>_I Should believe Mr. <HI>Cuningham</HI> very con&s;tant, if I had Faith enough to credit this Letter, <HI>Jeffry.</HI> What Complaints are here? But 'tis the Stile, that all young Lovers write.</P>

<P>Pray, Madam, believe me; you know I am a Man of Integrity: I cannot di&s;&s;emble. Let him write what he plea&s;es, If he did not love you, do you think I'd tell you &s;o?</P>

<P>Take my Word, Madam, my Ma&s;ter is not like other Men&mdash;Unle&s;s he loves a Lady, and loves her pa&s;&s;ionately too, he never troubles him&s;elf to com|pliment her much.</P>

<P>Never? Yes, <HI>Jeffry;</HI> &s;ometimes, you know, he compliments my Aunt.</P>

<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a convincing Proof of his Love to you; you cannot think him reduc'd to the Nece&s;&s;ity of making Love to an antiquated Piece, with de&s;ign to know her otherwi&s;e, than to obtain the Happine&s;s of &s;eeing you? But I &s;hall tell him, Madam&mdash;</P>

<P>All! Yes. Are you not content with that?</P>

<P>Any indifferent Per&s;on, that had Hands, and could but read, would have done, as much, as that.</P>

<P>For what, I be&s;eech you? Is not my Ma&s;ter bewitc'd, to court a Lady a whole Year, and &s;he hard|ly tell him &s;he loves him yet?</P>

<PB N="5" REF="5" MS="y">
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! She's but a Novice. Let me alone with her; I'll order the Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o, that if thy Ma&s;ter be di&s;creet and pa&s;&s;ionate enough in his Expre&s;&s;ions, he wins her Heart I'll warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>He can &s;ay nothing to her, but that damn'd Aunt of hers is harkning to't &s;till. What Plea&s;ure can &s;he find in Love at Fifty?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fie, <HI>Jeffry,</HI> you mu&s;t &s;ay Five and twenty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder any Woman can have the Impu|dence to live, and trouble Mankind after that Age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>There never was a Woman &s;o old, but &s;he re|tain'd a good Opinion of her &s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then &s;he dre&s;&s;es her &s;elf &s;o fanta&s;tically, that all may &s;ee &s;he &s;trives to appear Young in defiance of Nature. She is more gawdy in that &s;he calls Half-Mourning, than a young Bride is on her Wedding-Night. The Devil's in her if &s;he believes any one can love her: 'Tis jeering her, but to be commonly ci|vil to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little Flattery fires her. She believes all, that is &s;aid to her: And he that does not make love to her, and compliment her, &s;hall not be twice admit|ted to her Hou&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>O reverend Beauty! on my Con&s;cience, if I would grea&s;e her Chops with a few Compliments, &s;he'd mump and &s;mile upon me.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lovemore</HI> is thy Ma&s;ter's Friend, and is better belov'd here, than he imagines You mu&s;t per|&s;uade him to amu&s;e the Aunt, that Mr. <HI>Cuningham</HI> may have Convenience to court the Niece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lovemore</HI>'s tir'd with playing that part &s;o often; he is cloy'd with the Aunt, and &s;wears he'll have no more of her.</P>

<P>I'm &s;ure her Niece and I endure much more. Tell him, 'twill be Charity in him to relieve us.</P>

<P>This old Lady of mine has langui&s;h'd for a young Husband ever &s;ince Sir <HI>Oliver Laycock</HI> dy'd: She cares not what E&s;tate he has, or what Religion he's of, &s;o he be but young and lu&s;ty. Where is the great Vi&s;count <HI>Sans Terre,</HI> thy Ma&s;ter told her of? Methinks he's long a coming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some cro&s;s unlucky Bu&s;ine&s;s hinders him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has lately receiv'd &s;ome Letters, that have given a full Account of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much the wor&s;e. What is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>They &s;ay his Fortune is not very much, but he is greatly born, and very plea&s;ant; and that he is &s;o great a Lover of Mu&s;ick, he has not a Servant but can Sing or Dance, or Play upon &s;ome In&s;trument. You may know when he's come by the Noi&s;e; the Fiddlers will welcome him to Town; for all from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Wapping</HI> pay him Homage.</P>

<P>Wou'd he were but marry'd to her, <HI>Pru|dence.</HI></P>

<P>Whether he marries her or not, is not our Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>Jeffry.</HI> Let him but fool with us till thy Ma&s;ter has gain'd her Niece, and then our Work is done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jeff.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we have had enough of thy old Lady <HI>Laycock.</HI> Let us now talk of our own Affairs; &s;peak, do&s;t thou love me, <HI>Prudence?</HI></P>

<P>If you would have me credit you, &s;wear it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure you are jealous <HI>Jeffry?</HI></P>

<P>You're &s;omewhat near the Matter. I know your Humour well enough; you love a bold audaci|ous Fellow, that will &s;ay any thing, and &s;uch a one we have come to Town, one <HI>Merryman</HI> our Falconer; I fear you'll like him better than you do me.</P>

<P>Oh Fool! why &s;hould you think &s;o?</P>

<P>I have &s;ome Honour in me; but he's a Fellow that has eaten Shame, and drank after it. He is more impudent than a Court Page, and will take no De|nial.</P>

<P>You &s;ee what Power your Beauty has. Nei|ther can live a Moment without &s;eeing you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, they have other Bu&s;ine&s;s with me, <HI>Pru|dence;</HI> they came from <HI>Paris</HI> lately, and brought me a Letter from my Brother; and I believe they come for my An&s;wer now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does not one of 'em love you, Madam?</P>

<P>I have &s;ome Rea&s;on to believe he does; Mr. <HI>Lovemore</HI> has &s;par'd no Pains to per&s;uade me to quit my Widow-hood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been told, Madam, that Widow-hood is a Gift, Heaven &s;eldom be&s;tows but on its Favou|rites; you are rich, and know how trouble&s;ome Mar|riage is. For my part, I believe the faire&s;t Hair, the beautiful'&s;t Curls do not become your Fore-head &s;o well as <HI>Bando</HI> did; but every one, Madam, knows their own Nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confe&s;s, Widow-hood has its Conveniencies; but if Marriage be a Trouble to &s;ome, 'tis a Plea&s;ure to others, <HI>Prudence.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had the Experience of it thirty Years, how did you like it, Madam? They &s;ay, Sir <HI>Oliver Laycock</HI> lov'd your Lady&s;hip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>For all that he was jealous; and, what's wor&s;e, was Old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well; therefore you re&s;olve to have a young One now, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot blame me for that? Can you, <HI>Prudence?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no, 'tis well known Youth is comforta|ble. But, methinks, you &s;hould take one a little near|er your own Age, Madam. A very young Man may be too treacherous for you, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, is my Age &s;o vi&s;ible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam; with a little Help of Art you have &s;ome Remains of Beauty &s;till. You have &s;ome|thing about your Eyes as plea&s;ant now, as others have at Twenty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a very malicious World we live in, <HI>Pru|dence;</HI> they are &s;o apt to cen&s;ure, and &s;peak of any &s;ingle Woman, that one ought to marry to avoid that Scandal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some that are young are forc'd to marry, to avoid Detraction; others wou'd rather all that's Ill &s;hould be &s;aid of them, than to have no Notice ta|ken of 'em. I knew a young Lady that pin'd to a Con&s;umption, becau&s;e &s;he liv'd three Years about the Court, and never had the Honour to be lampoon'd. The Truth is, none that are Beautiful and Young can avoid Envy, but few are &s;o malicious, to &s;peak again&s;t the Old.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no Age exempt from Scandal, <HI>Pru|dence.</HI> When we are Young, they &s;ay we &s;ell our &s;elves; when Old, we are forc'd to hire, to buy our Lovers.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know what they &s;ay, Madam, of the old Marchione&s;s, your Friend, that was &s;o admir'd, &s;o courted in her Youth; who, when &s;he found &s;he was for&s;ook by all, was forc'd to hire a Player by the Quarter: How &s;oon rhe poor Fellow was tir'd too! How like a Sheep-biter he look'd after the fir&s;t two Months!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>This <HI>London</HI> is a very wicked Place, 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible to live without Scandal here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pru.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm afraid they'll &s;ay as much of you, Madam, if you bargain for a Husband. To covet one, that is both Young and Rich, is too much in Con&s;cience, Madam.</P>

<P>Con&s;ider his Quality, Madam, and 'bate him &s;omething for that. One thing I mu&s;t advi&s;e you; be not too prodigal of your Gold at fir&s;t; to be li|beral &s;ometimes will be convenient, and make him kinder to you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>For all this, I &s;hould think my &s;elf very happy, if I were certain of Mr. <HI>Cuningham</HI> or Mr. <HI>Lovemore.</HI></P>
</SP>
