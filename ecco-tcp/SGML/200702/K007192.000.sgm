<HEAD>A POLITICAL ROMANCE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IN my la&s;t, for want of &s;ome|thing better to write about, I told you what a World of Fending and Proving we have had of late, in this little Vil|lage of ours, about an <HI>old-ca&s;t-Pair-of-black-Plu&s;h-Breeches,</HI> which <HI>John,</HI> our Pa|ri&s;h-Clerk, about ten Years ago, it &s;eems, had made a Promi&s;e of to one <HI>Trim,</HI> who is our Sexton and Dog-Whipper.&mdash;To this you write me Word, that you have had more than either one or two Occa&s;ions to know a good deal of the &s;hifty Beha|viour of this &s;aid Ma&s;ter <HI>Trim,</HI>&mdash;and that
<PB N="2" REF="3">
you are a&s;toni&s;hed, nor can you for your Soul conceive, how &s;o worthle&s;s a Fellow, and &s;o worthle&s;s a Thing into the Bargain, could become the Occa&s;ion of &s;uch a Racket as I have repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Now, though you do not &s;ay expre&s;&s;ly, you could wi&s;h to hear any more about it, yet I &s;ee plain enough that I have rai&s;ed your Curio&s;ity; and therefore, from the &s;ame Motive, that I &s;lightly mentioned it at all in my la&s;t Letter, I will, in this, give you a full and very circum&s;tantial Account of the whole Affair.</P>
<P>But, before I begin, I mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;et you right in one very material Point, in which I have mi&s;&s;led you, as to the true Cau&s;e of all this Uproar among&s;t us;&mdash;which does not take its Ri&s;e, as I then told you, from the Affair of the <HI>Breeches;</HI>&mdash;but, on the contrary, the whole Affair of the <HI>Breeches</HI> has taken its Ri&s;e from it:&mdash;To under&s;tand which, you mu&s;t know, that the fir&s;t Beginning of the Squabble was not between <HI>John</HI> the Pari&s;h-Clerk and <HI>Trim</HI> the Sexton, but betwixt the Par|&s;on of the Pari&s;h and the &s;aid Ma&s;ter <HI>Trim,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="4">
about an old <HI>Watch-Coat,</HI> which had many Years hung up in the Church, which <HI>Trim</HI> had &s;et his Heart upon; and nothing would &s;erve <HI>Trim</HI> but he mu&s;t take it home, in order to have it converted into a <HI>warm Under-Petticoat</HI> for his Wife, and a <HI>Jerkin</HI> for him&s;elf, again&s;t Winter; which, in a plaintive Tone, he mo&s;t humbly begg'd his Reverence would con&s;ent to.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, Sir, who have &s;o often felt it, that a Principle of &s;trong Compa&s;&s;ion tran&s;ports a generous Mind &s;ometimes beyond what is &s;trictly right,&mdash;the Par&s;on was within an Ace of being an honourable Example of this very Crime;&mdash;for no &s;ooner did the di&s;tinct Words&mdash;<HI>Petticoat&mdash;poor Wife&mdash;warm&mdash;Winter</HI> &s;trike upon his Ear,&mdash;but his Heart warmed,&mdash;and, before <HI>Trim</HI> had well got to the End of his Petition, (being a Gentle|man of a frank and open Temper) he told him he was welcome to it, with all his Heart and Soul. But, <HI>Trim,</HI> &s;ays he, as you &s;ee I am but ju&s;t got down to my Living, and am an utter Stranger to all Pari&s;h-Matters, know nothing about this old Watch-Coat you beg of me, having never &s;een it in my
<PB N="4" REF="5">
Life, and therefore cannot be a Judge whether 'tis fit for &s;uch a Purpo&s;e; or, if it is, in Truth, know not whether 'tis mine to be&s;tow upon you or not;&mdash;you mu&s;t have a Week or ten Days Patience, till I can make &s;ome Inquiries about it;&mdash;and, if I find it is in my Power, I tell you again, Man, your Wife is heartily welcome to an Under-Petticoat out of it, and you to a Jerkin, was the Thing as good again as you repre&s;ent it.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to inform you, Sir, in this Place, That the Par&s;on was earne&s;tly bent to &s;erve <HI>Trim</HI> in this Affair, not only from the Motive of Genero&s;ity, which I have ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to him, but likewi&s;e from another Motive; and that was by way of making &s;ome Sort of Recompence for a Multitude of &s;mall Services which <HI>Trim</HI> had occa&s;ionally done, and indeed was continually doing, (as he was much about the Hou&s;e) when his own Man was out of the Way. For all the&s;e Rea&s;ons to|gether, I &s;ay, the Par&s;on of the Pari&s;h in|tended to &s;erve <HI>Trim</HI> in this Matter to the utmo&s;t of his Power: All that was want|ing was previou&s;ly to inquire, if any one
<PB N="5" REF="6">
had a <HI>Claim</HI> to it;&mdash;or whether, as it had, Time immemorial, hung up in the Church, the taking it down might not rai&s;e a Clamour in the Pari&s;h. The&s;e In|quiries were the very Thing that <HI>Trim</HI> dreaded in his Heart.&mdash;He knew very well that if the Par&s;on &s;hould but &s;ay one Word to the Church-Wardens about it, there would be an End of the whole Af|fair. For this, and &s;ome other Rea&s;ons not nece&s;&s;ary to be told you, at pre&s;ent, <HI>Trim</HI> was for allowing no Time in this Mat|ter;&mdash;but, on the contrary, doubled his Diligence and Importunity at the Vicarage-Hou&s;e;&mdash;plagued the whole Family to Death;&mdash;pre&s;&s;ed his Suit Morning, Noon, and Night; and, to &s;horten my Story, teazed the poor Gentleman, who was but in an ill State of Health, almo&s;t out of his Life about it.</P>
<P>You will not wonder, when I tell you, that all this Hurry and Precipitation, on the Side of Ma&s;ter <HI>Trim,</HI> produced its na|tural Effect on the Side of the Par&s;on, and that was, a Su&s;picion that all was not right at the Bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">
He was one Evening &s;itting alone in his Study, weighing and turning this Doubt every Way in his Mind; and, after an Hour and a half's &s;erious Deliberation up|on the Affair, and running over <HI>Trim</HI>'s Be|haviour throughout,&mdash;he was ju&s;t &s;aying to him&s;elf, <HI>It mu&s;t be &s;o;</HI>&mdash;when a &s;udden Rap at the Door put an End to his Solilo|quy,&mdash;and, in a few Minutes, to his Doubts too; for a Labourer in the Town, who deem'd him&s;elf pa&s;t his fifty-&s;econd Year, had been returned by the Con&s;table in the Militia-Li&s;t,&mdash;and he had come, with a Groat in his Hand, to &s;earch the Pari&s;h Regi&s;ter for his Age.&mdash;The Par&s;on bid the poor Fellow put the Groat into his Pocket, and go into the Kitchen:&mdash;Then &s;hutting the Study Door, and taking down the Pari&s;h Regi&s;ter,&mdash;<HI>Who knows,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>but I may find &s;omething here about this &s;elf|&s;ame Watch-Coat?</HI>&mdash;He had &s;carce un|cla&s;ped the Book, in &s;aying this, when he popp'd upon the very Thing he wanted, fairly wrote on the fir&s;t Page, pa&s;ted to the In&s;ide of one of the Covers, whereon was a Memorandum about the very Thing in Que&s;tion, in the&s;e expre&s;s Words:</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"><Q REND="inline"><P><HI REND="blackletterType">MEMORANDUM.</HI></P>
<P><HI REND="blackletterType">The great Watch-Coat was purcha&s;ed and given above two hundred Years ago, by the Lord of the Manor, to this Pari&s;h-Church, to the &s;ole U&s;e and Behoof of the poor Sextons thereof, and their Succe&s;&s;ors, for ever, to be worn up them re&s;pectively in winterly cold Nights, in ringing</HI> Com|plines, Pa&s;&s;ing-Bells, &amp;c. <HI REND="blackletterType">which the &s;aid Lord of the Manor had done, in Piety, to keep the poor Wretches warm, and for the Good of his own Soul, for which they were di|rected to pray,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. <HI>Ju&s;t Hea|ven!</HI> &s;aid the Par&s;on to him&s;elf, looking upwards, <HI>What an E&s;cape have I had I Give this for an Under-Petticoat to</HI> Trim<HI>'s Wife! I would not have con&s;ented to &s;uch a De&s;ecration to be Primate of all</HI> Eng|land; <HI>nay, I would not have di&s;turb'd a &s;ingle Button of it for half my Tythes!</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>Scarce were the Words out of his Mouth, when in pops <HI>Trim</HI> with the whole Sub|ject of the Exclamation under both his Arms.&mdash;I &s;ay, under both his Arms;&mdash;for he had actually got it ripp'd and cut out ready, his own Jerkin under one Arm, and the Petticoat under the other, in order to be carried to the Taylor to be made up,&mdash;
<PB N="8" REF="9">
and had ju&s;t &s;tepp'd in, in high Spirits, to &s;hew the Par&s;on how cleverly it had held out.</P>
<P>There are many good Similies now &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting in the World, but which I have nei|ther Time to recollect or look for, which would give you a &s;trong Conception of the A&s;toni&s;hment and hone&s;t Indignation which this unexpected Stroke of <HI>Trim</HI>'s Impudence impre&s;s'd upon the Par&s;on's Looks.&mdash;Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, That it ex|ceeded all fair De&s;cription,&mdash;as well as all Power of proper Re&s;entment,&mdash;except this, that <HI>Trim</HI> was ordered, in a &s;tern Voice, to lay the Bundles down upon the Table,&mdash;to go about his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and wait upon him, at his Peril, the next Morning at Eleven preci&s;ely:&mdash;Again&s;t this Hour, like a wi&s;e Man, the Par&s;on had &s;ent to de&s;ire <HI>John</HI> the Pari&s;h-Clerk, who bore an exceeding good Character as a Man of Truth, and who having, moreover, a pretty Freehold of about eighteen Pounds a Year in the Town&s;hip, was a leading Man in it; and, upon the whole, was &s;uch a one of whom it might be &s;aid,&mdash;That he rather did Honour to his Office,&mdash;than
<PB N="9" REF="10">
that his Office did Honour to him.&mdash;Him he &s;ends for, with the Church-Wardens, and one of the Sides-Men, a grave, know|ing, old Man, to be pre&s;ent:&mdash;For as <HI>Trim</HI> had with-held the whole Truth from the Par&s;on, touching the Watch-Coat, he thought it probable he would as certainly do the &s;ame Thing to others; though this, I &s;aid, was wi&s;e, the Trouble of the Precau|tion might have been &s;pared,&mdash;becau&s;e the Par&s;on's Character was unblemi&s;h'd,&mdash;and he had ever been held by the World in the E&s;timation of a Man of Honour and Inte|grity.&mdash;<HI>Trim</HI>'s Character, on the contrary, was as well known, if not in the World, yet, at lea&s;t, in all the Pari&s;h, to be that of a little, dirty, pimping, pettifogging, ambi|dextrous Fellow,&mdash;who neither cared what he did or &s;aid of any, provided he could get a Penny by it.&mdash;This might, I &s;ay, have made any Precaution needle&s;s;&mdash;but you mu&s;t know, as the Par&s;on had in a Manner but ju&s;t got down to his Living, he dreaded the Con&s;equences of the lea&s;t ill Impre&s;&s;ion on his fir&s;t Entrance among&s;t his Pari&s;hioners, which would have di&s;abled him from do|ing them the Good he wi&s;hed;&mdash;&s;o that, out of Regard to his Flock, more than the
<PB N="10" REF="11">
nece&s;&s;ary Care due to him&s;elf,&mdash;he was re|&s;olv'd not to lie at the Mercy of what Re|&s;entment might vent, or Malice lend an Ear to.&mdash;Accordingly the whole Matter was rehear&s;ed from fir&s;t to la&s;t by the Par&s;on, in the Manner I've told you, in the Hear|ing of <HI>John</HI> the Pari&s;h-Clerk, and in the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Trim.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Trim</HI> had little to &s;ay for him&s;elf, ex|cept <Q REND="inline">"That the Par&s;on had ab&s;olutely pro|mi&s;ed to be friend him and his Wife in the Affair, to the utmo&s;t of his Power: That the Watch-Coat was certainly in his Power, and that he might &s;till give it him if he plea&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P>To this, the Par&s;on's Reply was &s;hort, but &s;trong, <Q REND="inline">"That nothing was in his <HI>Power</HI> to do, but what he could do <HI>hone&s;t|ly:</HI>&mdash;That in giving the Coat to him and his Wife, he &s;hould do a manife&s;t Wrong to the <HI>next</HI> Sexton; the great Watch-Coat being the mo&s;t comfortable Part of the Place:&mdash;That he &s;hould, moreover, injure the Right of his own Succe&s;&s;or, who would be ju&s;t &s;o much a wor&s;e Patron, as the Worth of the Coat amounted to;&mdash;and, in
<PB N="11" REF="12">
a Word, he declared, that his whole Intent in promi&s;ing that Coat, was Charity to <HI>Trim;</HI> but <HI>Wrong</HI> to no Man; that was a Re&s;erve, he &s;aid, made in all Ca&s;es of this Kind:&mdash;and he declared &s;olemnly, <HI>in Verbo Sacerdotis,</HI> That this was his Meaning, and was &s;o under&s;tood by <HI>Trim</HI> him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>With the Weight of this Truth, and the great good Sen&s;e and &s;trong Rea&s;on which accompanied all the Par&s;on &s;aid upon the Subject,&mdash;poor <HI>Trim</HI> was driven to his la&s;t Shift,&mdash;and begg'd he might be &s;uffered to plead his Right and Title to the Watch-Coat, if not by <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> at lea&s;t by <HI>Servi|ces.</HI>&mdash;It was well known how much he was entitled to it upon the&s;e Scores: That he had black'd the Par&s;on's Shoes without Count, and grea&s;ed his Boots above fifty Times:&mdash;That he had run for Eggs into the Town upon all Occa&s;ions;&mdash;whetted the Knives at all Hours;&mdash;catched his Hor&s;e and rubbed him down:&mdash;That for his Wife &s;he had been ready upon all Occa&s;ions to charr for them;&mdash;and neither he nor &s;he, to the be&s;t of his Remembrance, ever took a Farthing, or any thing beyond a Mug of Ale.&mdash;To this Account of his Services he
<PB N="12" REF="13">
begg'd Leave to add tho&s;e of his Wi&s;hes, which, he &s;aid, had been equally great.&mdash;He affirmed, and was ready, he &s;aid, to make it appear, by Numbers of Witne&s;&s;es, <Q REND="inline">"He had drank his Reverence's Health a thou&s;and Times, (by the bye, he did not add out of the Par&s;on's own Ale): That he not only drank his Health, but wi&s;h'd it; and never came to the Hou&s;e, but a&s;k'd his Man kindly how he did; that in par|ticular, about half a Year ago, when his Reverence cut his Finger in paring an Ap|ple, he went half a Mile to a&s;k a cunning Woman, what was good to &s;tanch Blood, and actually returned with a Cobweb in his Breeches Pocket:&mdash;Nay, &s;ays <HI>Trim,</HI> it was not a Fortnight ago, when your Reve|rence took that violent Purge, that I went to the far End of the whole Town to bor|row you a Clo&s;e-&s;tool,&mdash;and came back, as my Neighbours, who flouted me, will all bear witne&s;s, with the Pan upon my Head, and never thought it too much."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Trim</HI> concluded his pathetick Remon|&s;trance with &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"He hoped his Re|verence's Heart would not &s;uffer him to requite &s;o many faithful Services by &s;o un|kind
<PB N="13" REF="14">
a Return:&mdash;That if it was &s;o, as he was the fir&s;t, &s;o he hoped he &s;hould be the la&s;t, Example of a Man of his Condition &s;o treated."</Q>&mdash;This Plan of <HI>Trim</HI>'s De|fence, which <HI>Trim</HI> had put him&s;elf upon,&mdash;could admit of no other Reply but a ge|neral Smile.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, let me inform you, That all that could be &s;aid, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> on both Sides, being fairly heard, it was plain, That <HI>Trim,</HI> in every Part of this Affair, had behaved very ill;&mdash;and <HI>one</HI> Thing, which was never expected to be known of him, happening in the Cour&s;e of this De|bate to come out again&s;t him;&mdash;namely, That he had gone and told the Par&s;on, be|fore he had ever &s;et Foot in his Pari&s;h, That <HI>John</HI> his Pari&s;h-Clerk,&mdash;his Church-Wardens, and &s;ome of the Heads of the Pari&s;h, were a Parcel of Scoundrels.&mdash;Up|on the Up&s;hot, <HI>Trim</HI> was kick'd out of Doors; and told, at his Peril, never to come there again.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t <HI>Trim</HI> huff'd and bounced mo&s;t terribly;&mdash;&s;wore he would get a War|rant;&mdash;then nothing would &s;erve him but
<PB N="14" REF="15">
he would call a Bye-Law, and tell the whole Pari&s;h how the Par&s;on had mi&s;u&s;ed him;&mdash;but cooling of that, as fearing the Par&s;on might po&s;&s;ibly bind him over to his good Behaviour, and, for aught he knew, might &s;end him to the Hou&s;e of Correc|tion,&mdash;he let the Par&s;on alone; and, to re|venge him&s;elf, falls foul upon his Clerk, who had no more to do in the Quarrel than you or I;&mdash;rips up the Promi&s;e of the old|ca&s;t-Pair-of-black-Plu&s;h-Breeches, and rai&s;es an Uproar in the Town about it, not|with&s;tanding it had &s;lept ten Years.&mdash;But all this, you mu&s;t know, is look'd upon in no other Light, but as an artful Stroke of General&s;hip in <HI>Trim,</HI> to rai&s;e a Du&s;t, and cover him&s;elf under the di&s;graceful Cha|&s;ti&s;ement he has undergone.</P>
<P>If your Curio&s;ity is not yet &s;atisfied,&mdash;I will now proceed to relate the <HI>Battle</HI> of the Breeches, in the &s;ame exact Manner I have done <HI>that</HI> of the Watch-Coat.</P>
<P>Be it known then, that, about ten Years ago, when <HI>John</HI> was appointed Pa|ri&s;h-Clerk of this Church, this &s;aid Ma&s;ter <HI>Trim</HI> took no &s;mall Pains to get into <HI>John</HI>'s
<PB N="15" REF="16">
good Graces; in order, as it afterwards appeared, to coax a Promi&s;e out of him of a Pair of Breeches, which <HI>John</HI> had then by him, of black Plu&s;h, not much the wor&s;e for wearing;&mdash;<HI>Trim</HI> only begging for God's Sake to have them be&s;towed up|on him when <HI>John</HI> &s;hould think fit to ca&s;t them.</P>
<P><HI>Trim</HI> was one of tho&s;e kind of Men who loved a Bit of Finery in his Heart, and would rather have a tatter'd Rag of a Bet|ter Body's, than the be&s;t plain whole Thing his Wife could &s;pin him.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> who was naturally un&s;u&s;picious, made no more Difficulty of promi&s;ing the Breeches, than the Par&s;on had done in pro|mi&s;ing the Great Coat; and, indeed, with &s;omething le&s;s Re&s;erve,&mdash;becau&s;e the Breeches were <HI>John's own,</HI> and he could give them, without Wrong, to whom he thought fit.</P>
<P>It happened, I was going to &s;ay un|luckily, but, I &s;hould rather &s;ay, mo&s;t luckily, for <HI>Trim,</HI> for he was the only Gainer by it,&mdash;that a Quarrel, about &s;ome
<PB N="16" REF="17">
&s;ix or eight Weeks after this, broke out between <HI>the late</HI> Par&s;on of the Pari&s;h and <HI>John</HI> the Clerk. Somebody (and it was thought to be Nobody but <HI>Trim</HI>) had put it into the Par&s;on's Head, "That <HI>John</HI>'s De&s;k in the Church was, at the lea&s;t, four Inches higher than it &s;hould be:&mdash;That the Thing gave Offence, and was indecorous, ina&s;much as it ap|proach'd too near upon a Level with the Par&s;on's De&s;k it&s;elf. This Hard&s;hip the Par&s;on complained of loudly,&mdash;and told <HI>John</HI> one Day after Prayers,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"He could bear it no longer:&mdash;And would have it al|ter'd and brought down as it &s;hould be."</Q> <HI>John</HI> made no other Reply, but, <Q REND="inline">"That the De&s;k was not of his rai&s;ing:&mdash;That 'twas not one Hair Breadth higher than he found it;&mdash;and that as he found it, &s;o would he leave it:&mdash;In &s;hort, he would neither make an Encroachment, nor would he &s;uffer one."</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>late</HI> Par&s;on might have his Virtues, but the leading Part of his Character was not <HI>Humility;</HI> &s;o that <HI>John</HI>'s Stiffne&s;s in this Point was not likely to reconcile Mat|ters.&mdash;This was <HI>Trim</HI>'s Harve&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18">
After a friendly Hint to <HI>John</HI> to &s;tand his Ground,&mdash;away hies <HI>Trim</HI> to make his Market at the Vicarage:&mdash;What pa&s;s'd there, I will not &s;ay, intending not to be uncharitable; &s;o &s;hall content my&s;elf with only gue&s;&s;ing at it, from the &s;udden Change that appeared in <HI>Trim</HI>'s Dre&s;s for the bet|ter;&mdash;for he had left his old ragged Coat, Hat and Wig, in the Stable, and was come forth &s;trutting acro&s;s the Church-yard, y'clad in a good creditable ca&s;t Coat, large Hat and Wig, which the Par&s;on had ju&s;t given him.&mdash;Ho!

<P>Here <HI>John</HI> mentioned <HI>Mark Slender,</HI> (who, it &s;eems, the Day before, had a&s;k'd <HI>John</HI> for 'em) not knowing they were un|der Promi&s;e to <HI>Trim.</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Come, <HI>Trim,</HI> &s;ays he, let poor <HI>Mark</HI> have 'em,&mdash;You know he has not a Pair to his A<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">: Be&s;ides, you &s;ee he is ju&s;t of my Size, and they will fit him to a T; where|as, if I give 'em to you,&mdash;look ye, they

<P>Every Tittle of this was mo&s;t undoubt|edly true; for <HI>Trim,</HI> you mu&s;t know, by &s;oul Feeding, and playing the good Fel|low at the Par&s;on's, was grown &s;omewhat gro&s;s about the lower Parts, <HI>if not higher:</HI> So that, as all <HI>John</HI> &s;aid upon the Occa|&s;ion was fact, <HI>Trim,</HI> with much ado, and after a hundred Hum's and Hah's, at la&s;t, out of mere Compa&s;&s;ion to <HI>Mark, &s;igns, &s;eals, and delivers up <HI REND="blackletterType">all Right, Intere&s;t, and Preten&s;ions what&s;oever, in and to the &s;aid Breeches; thereby binding his Heirs, Erecutors, Admini&s;trators, and A&s;&s;ignes, never mere to call the &s;aid Claim in Que|&s;tion.</HI></HI></P>
<P>All this Renunciation was &s;et forth in an ample Manner, to be in pure Pity to <HI>Mark</HI>'s Nakedne&s;s;&mdash;but the Secret was, <HI>Trim</HI> had an Eye to, and firmly expected in his own Mind, the great Green Pulpit-Cloth and old Velvet Cu&s;hion, which were that very Year to be taken down;&mdash;
<PB N="20" REF="21">
which, by the Bye, could he have wheed|led <HI>John</HI> a &s;econd Time out of 'em, as he hoped, he had made up the Lo&s;s of his Breeches Seven-fold.</P>
<P>Now, you mu&s;t know, this Pulpit-Cloth and Cu&s;hion were not in <HI>John's</HI> Gift, but in the Church-Wardens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;However, as I &s;aid above, that <HI>John</HI> was a leading Man in the Pari&s;h, <HI>Trim</HI> knew he could help him to them if he would:&mdash;But <HI>John</HI> had got a Surfeit of him;&mdash;&s;o, when the Pulpit-Cloth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were ta|ken down, they were immediately given (<HI>John</HI> having a great Say in it) to <HI>William Doe,</HI> who under&s;tood very well what U&s;e to make of them.</P>

<P><HI>John</HI> contented him&s;elf with giving a plain An&s;wer to every Article that <HI>Trim</HI> had laid to his Charge, and appealed to his Neighbours who remembered the whole Affair;&mdash;and as he knew there was never any Thing to be got in wre&s;tling with a

<P>I Have broke open my Letter to inform you, that I mi&s;s'd the Opportunity of &s;ending it by the Me&s;&s;enger, who I ex|pected would have called upon me in his Return through this Village to <HI>York,</HI> &s;o it has laid a Week or ten Days by me.</P>
<P>&mdash;I am not &s;orry for the Di&s;appoint|ment, becau&s;e &s;omething has &s;ince hap|pened, in Continuation of this Affair, which I am thereby enabled to tran&s;mit to you, all under one Trouble.</P>
<P>When I fini&s;hed the above Account, I thought (as did every Soul in the Pari&s;h) <HI>Trim</HI> had met with &s;o thorough a Rebuff from <HI>John</HI> the Pari&s;h - Clerk and the Town's Folks, who all took again&s;t him, that <HI>Trim</HI> would be glad to be quiet, and let the Matter re&s;t.</P>
<P>But, it &s;eems, it is not half an Hour ago &s;ince <HI>Trim</HI> &s;allied forth again; and, having borrowed a Sow-Gelder's Horn, with hard Blowing he got the whole Town round him, and endeavoured to rai&s;e a Di&s;turb|ance,
<PB N="26" REF="27">
and fight the whole Battle over again:&mdash;That he had been u&s;ed in the la&s;t Fray wor&s;e than a Dog;&mdash;not by <HI>John</HI> the Pari&s;h-Clerk,&mdash;for I &s;hou'd not, quoth <HI>Trim,</HI> have valued him a Ru&s;h &s;ingle Hands:&mdash;But all the Town &s;ided with him, and twelve Men in <HI>Buckram</HI> &s;et upon me all at once, and kept me in Play at Sword's Point for three Hours together.&mdash;Be&s;ides, quoth <HI>Trim,</HI> there were two mi&s;begotten Knaves in <HI>Kendal Green,</HI> who lay all the while in Ambu&s;h in <HI>John</HI>'s own Hou&s;e, and they all <HI>&s;ixteen</HI> came upon my Back, and let drive at me together.&mdash;A Plague, &s;ays <HI>Trim,</HI> of all Cowards!&mdash;<HI>Trim</HI> repeated this Story above a Dozen Times;&mdash;which made &s;ome of the Neighbours pity him, thinking the poor Fellow crack-brain'd, and that he actually believed what he &s;aid. After this <HI>Trim</HI> dropp'd the Affair of the <HI>Breeches,</HI> and begun a fre&s;h Di&s;pute about the <HI>Reading-De&s;k,</HI> which I told you had occa&s;ioned &s;ome &s;mall Di&s;pute be|tween the <HI>late</HI> Par&s;on and <HI>John,</HI> &s;ome Years ago.</P>
<P>This <HI>Reading-De&s;k,</HI> as you will ob&s;erve, was but an Epi&s;ode wove into the main Story by the Bye;&mdash;for the main Affair
<PB N="27" REF="28">
was the <HI>Battle of the Breeches</HI> and <HI>Great Watch-Coat.</HI>&mdash;However, <HI>Trim</HI> being at la&s;t driven out of the&s;e two Citadels,&mdash;he has &s;eized hold, in his Retreat, of this <HI>Reading-De&s;k,</HI> with a View, as it &s;eems, to take Shelter behind it.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay but the Man has fought it out ob&s;tinately enough;&mdash;and, had his Cau&s;e been good, I &s;hould have really pi|tied him. For when he was driven out of the <HI>Great Watch-Coat,</HI>&mdash;you &s;ee, he did not run away;&mdash;no,&mdash;he retreated be|hind the <HI>Breeches;</HI>&mdash;and, when he could make nothing of it behind the <HI>Breeches,</HI>&mdash;he got behind the <HI>Reading-De&s;k.</HI>&mdash;To what other Hold <HI>Trim</HI> will next retreat, the Politicians of this Village are not agreed.&mdash;Some think his next Move will be towards the Rear of the Par&s;on's Boot;&mdash;but, as it is thought he cannot make a long Stand there,&mdash;others are of Opinion, That <HI>Trim</HI> will once more in his Life get hold of the Par&s;on's Hor&s;e, and charge upon him, or perhaps behind him.&mdash;But as the Hor&s;e is not ea&s;y to be caught, the more general Opinion is, That, when he is driven out of the <HI>Reading-De&s;k,</HI> he will make his la&s;t Retreat in &s;uch a Manner as, if po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="28" REF="29">
to gain the <HI>Clo&s;e-Stool,</HI> and defend him|&s;elf behind it to the very la&s;t Drop. If <HI>Trim</HI> &s;hould make this Movement, by my Advice he &s;hould be left be&s;ides his Cita|del, in full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Field of Battle;&mdash;where, 'tis certain, he will keep every Body a League off, and may pop by him&s;elf till he is weary: Be&s;ides, as <HI>Trim</HI> &s;eems bent upon <HI>purging</HI> him&s;elf, and may have Abundance of foul Humours to work off, I think he cannot be better placed.</P>
<P>But this is all Matter of Speculation.&mdash;Let me carry you back to Matter of Fact, and tell you what Kind of a Stand <HI>Trim</HI> has actually made behind the &s;aid <HI>De&s;k.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Neighbours and Town&s;men all, I will be &s;worn before my Lord Mayor, That <HI>John</HI> and his nineteen Men in <HI>Buckram,</HI> have abu&s;ed me wor&s;e than a Dog; for they told you that I play'd fa&s;t and go-loo&s;e with the <HI>late</HI> Par&s;on and him, in that old Di&s;pute of theirs about the <HI>Reading-De&s;k;</HI> and that I made Matters wor&s;e between them, and not better."</Q></P>
<P>Of this Charge, <HI>Trim</HI> declared he was as innocent as the Child that was unborn:
<PB N="29" REF="30">
That he would be Book-&s;worn he had no Hand in it. He produced a &s;trong Wit|ne&s;s;&mdash;and, moreover, in&s;inuated, that <HI>John</HI> him&s;elf, in&s;tead of being angry for what he had done in it, had actually thank'd him. Aye, <HI>Trim,</HI> &s;ays the Wight in the Plu&s;h Breeches, but that was, <HI>Trim,</HI> the Day before <HI>John</HI> found thee out.&mdash;Be&s;ides, <HI>Trim,</HI> there is nothing in that:&mdash;For, the very Year that thou wa&s;t made Town's Pinder, thou knowe&s;t well, that I both thank'd thee my&s;elf; and, moreover, gave thee a good warm Supper for turning <HI>John Lund</HI>'s Cows and Hor&s;es out of my Hard-Corn Clo&s;e; which if thou had'&s;t not done, (as thou told'&s;t me) I &s;hould have lo&s;t my whole Crop: Whereas, <HI>John Lund</HI> and <HI>Thomas Patt,</HI> who are both here to te&s;tify, and will take their Oaths on't, That thou thy&s;elf wa&s;t the very Man who &s;et the Gate open; and, after all,&mdash;it was not thee, <HI>Trim,</HI>&mdash;'twas the Black&s;mith's poor Lad who turn'd them out: So that a Man may be thank'd and rewarded too for a good Turn which he never did, nor ever did intend.</P>
<P><HI>Trim</HI> could not &s;u&s;tain this unexpected Stroke;&mdash;&s;o <HI>Trim</HI> march'd off the Field,
<PB N="30" REF="31">
without Colours flying, or his Horn &s;ound|ing, or any other En&s;igns of Honour whatever.</P>
<P>Whether after this <HI>Trim</HI> intends to rally a &s;econd Time,&mdash;or whether <HI>Trim</HI> may not take it into his Head to claim the Vic|tory,&mdash;no one but <HI>Trim</HI> him&s;elf can in|form you:&mdash;However, the general Opi|nion, upon the whole, is this,&mdash;That, in three &s;everal pitch'd Battles, <HI>Trim</HI> has been &s;o <HI>trimm'd,</HI> as never di&s;a&s;trous Hero was trimm'd before him.</P>

<HEAD>THE KEY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS <HI>Romance</HI> was, by &s;ome Mi&s;|chance or other, dropp'd in the <HI>Min&s;ter-Yard, York,</HI> and pick'd up by a Member of a &s;mall Political Club in that City; where it was carried, and publickly read to the Members the la&s;t Club Night.</P>
<P>It was in&s;tantly agreed to, by a great Majority, That it was a <HI>Political Romance;</HI> but concerning what State or Potentate, could not &s;o ea&s;ily be &s;ettled among&s;t them.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident of the Night, who is thought to be as clear and quick-&s;ighted as any one of the whole Club in Things of this Nature, di&s;covered plainly, That the Di&s;turbances therein &s;et forth, related to tho&s;e on the <HI>Continent:</HI>&mdash;That <HI>Trim</HI> could be Nobody but the King of <HI>France,</HI> by who&s;e &s;hifting and intriguing Behaviour, all <HI>Europe</HI> was &s;et together by the Ears:&mdash;'That <HI>Trim</HI>'s Wife was certainly the <HI>Em|pre&s;s,</HI> who are as kind together, &s;ays he, as any Man and Wife can be for their

<P>I prote&s;t, &s;ays a Gentleman who &s;at next but one to the Pre&s;ident, and who, it &s;eems, was the Par&s;on of the Pari&s;h, a

Member not only of the Political, but al&s;o of a Mu&s;ical Club in the next Street;&mdash;I prote&s;t, &s;ays he, if this Explanation is right, which I think it is,&mdash;That the whole makes a very fine Symbol.&mdash;You have always &s;ome Mu&s;ical In&s;trument or other in your Head, I think, &s;ays the Al|derman.&mdash;Mu&s;ical In&s;trument! replies the Par&s;on, in A&s;toni&s;hment,&mdash;Mr. Alder|man, I mean an Allegory; and I think the greedy Di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Trim</HI> and his Wife, in ripping the <HI>Great Watch-Coat</HI> to Pieces, in order to convert it into a Petticoat for the one, and a Jerkin for the other, is one of the mo&s;t beautiful of the Kind I ever met with; and will &s;hew all the World what have been the true Views and Inten|tions of the Hou&s;es of <HI>Bourbon</HI> and <HI>Au|&s;tria</HI> in this abominable Coalition,&mdash;I might have called it Whoredom:&mdash;Nay, &s;ays the Alderman, 'tis downright Adul|terydom, or nothing.</P>
<P>This Hypothe&s;is of the Pre&s;ident's ex|plain'd every Thing in the <HI>Romance</HI> ex|treamly well; and, withall, was delivered with &s;o much Readine&s;s and Air of Cer|tainty, as begot an Opinion in two Thirds of the Club, that Mr. Pre&s;ident was actu|ally
<PB N="35" REF="40">
the Author of the <HI>Romance</HI> him&s;elf: But a Gentleman who &s;at on the oppo&s;ite Side of the Table, who had come piping|hot from reading the Hi&s;tory of King <HI>Wil|liam</HI>'s and Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Wars, and who was thought, at the Bottom, to envy the Pre&s;ident the Honour both of the <HI>Romance</HI> and Explanation too, gave an entire new Turn to it all. He acquainted the Club, That Mr. Pre&s;ident was altogether wrong in every Suppo&s;ition he had made, except that one, where the <HI>Great Watch-Coat</HI> was &s;aid by him to repre&s;ent <HI>Europe,</HI> or at lea&s;t a great Part of it:&mdash;So far he acknowledged he was pretty right; but that he had not gone far enough backwards into our Hi&s;|tory to come at the Truth. He then ac|quainted them, that the dividing the <HI>Great Watch-Coat</HI> did, and could, allude to no|thing el&s;e in the World but the <HI>Partition-Treaty;</HI> which, by the Bye, he told them, was the mo&s;t unhappy and &s;candalous Tran&s;action in all King <HI>William</HI>'s Life: It was that fal&s;e Step, and that only, &s;ays he, ri&s;ing from his Chair, and &s;triking his Hand upon the Table with great Violence; it was that fal&s;e Step, &s;ays he, knitting his Brows
<PB N="36" REF="41">
and throwing his Pipe down upon the Ground, that has laid the Foundation of all the Di&s;turbances and Sorrows we feel and lament at this very Hour; and as for <HI>Trim</HI>'s giving up the <HI>Breeches,</HI> look ye, it is al|mo&s;t Word for Word copied from the <HI>French</HI> King and <HI>Dauphin</HI>'s Renunciation of <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> which all the World knew (as was the very Ca&s;e of the <HI>Breeches</HI>) were renounced by them on pur|po&s;e to be reclaim'd when Time &s;hould &s;erve.</P>
<P>This Explanation had too much Inge|nuity in it to be altogether &s;lighted; and, in Truth, the wor&s;t Fault it had, &s;eem'd to be the prodigious Heat of it; which (as an Apothecary, who &s;at next the Fire, ob|&s;erv'd, in a very low Whi&s;per to his next Neighbour) was &s;o much incorporated into every Particle of it, that it was impo&s;&s;ible, under &s;uch Fermentation, it &s;hould work its de&s;ired Effect.</P>
<P>This, however, no way intimidated a little valiant Gentleman, though he &s;at the very next Man, from giving an Opinion as diametrically oppo&s;ite as <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> is from <HI>We&s;t.</HI></P>

<P>He told the Company, frankly, he did not under&s;tand what <HI>Ichnography</HI> meant:&mdash;But as for the Shape of a <HI>Pair of Breeches,</HI> as he had had the Advantage of cutting out &s;o many hundred Pairs in his

<P>Now, to my Mind, &s;ays he, there is nothing in all the Terraqueous Globe (a Map of which, it &s;eems, hung up in his Work-Shop) &s;o like a <HI>Pair of Breeches</HI> unmade up, as the I&s;land of <HI>Sicily:</HI>&mdash;Nor is there any thing, if you go to that, quoth an hone&s;t Shoe-maker, who had the Ho|nour to be a Member of the Club, &s;o much like a <HI>Jack-Boot,</HI> to my Fancy, as the Kingdom of <HI>Italy.</HI>&mdash;What the Duce has either <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>Sicily</HI> to do in the Affair? cries the Pre&s;ident, who, by this Time, began to tremble for his Hypothe&s;is,&mdash;What have they to do?&mdash;Why, an&s;wered the <HI>Partition-Treaty</HI> Gentleman, with great Spirit and Joy &s;parkling in his Eyes,&mdash;They have ju&s;t &s;o much, Sir, to do in the Debate as to overthrow your Suppo&s;itions, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the Certainty of mine be|yond the Po&s;&s;ibility of a Doubt: For, &s;ays he, (with an Air of Sovereign Triumph over the Pre&s;ident's Politicks)&mdash;By the <HI>Partition-Treaty,</HI> Sir, both <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI> were the very Kingdoms made to

<P>Almo&s;t every one apprehended the De|bate to be now ended, and that no one Member would venture any new Conjec|ture upon the <HI>Romance,</HI> after &s;o many clear and deci&s;ive Interpretations had been given. But, hold,&mdash;Clo&s;e to the Fire, and op|po&s;ite to where the Apothecary &s;at, there &s;at al&s;o a Gentleman of the Law, who, from the Beginning to the End of the Hearing of this Cau&s;e, &s;eem'd no way &s;atisfied in his Con&s;cience with any one Proceeding in it. This Gentleman had not yet opened his Mouth, but had waited patiently till they had all gone thro' their &s;everal Evi|dences on the other Side;&mdash;re&s;erving him|&s;elf, like an expert Practitioner, for the la&s;t Word in the Debate. When the

<HI>Partition-Treaty-</HI>Gentleman had fini&s;h'd what he had to &s;ay,&mdash;He got up,&mdash;and, advancing towards the Table, told them, That the Error they had all gone upon thus far, in making out the &s;everal Facts in the <HI>Romance,</HI>&mdash;was in looking too high; which, with great Candor, he &s;aid, was a very natural Thing, and very excu&s;able withall, in &s;uch a Political Club as theirs: For In&s;tance, continues he, you have been &s;earching the <HI>Regi&s;ters,</HI> and looking into the <HI>Deeds</HI> of <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Emperors,</HI>&mdash;as if Nobody had any <HI>Deeds</HI> to &s;hew or compare the <HI>Romance</HI> to but them&s;elves.&mdash;This, continued the Attorney, is ju&s;t as much out of the Way of good Practice, as if I &s;hould carry a Thing &s;lap-da&s;h into the Hou&s;e of Lords, which was under forty Shillings, and might be decided in the next County-Court for &s;ix Shillings and Eight|pence.&mdash;He then took the <HI>Romance</HI> in his Left Hand, and pointing with the Fore-Finger of his Right towards the &s;econd Page, he humbly begg'd Leave to ob&s;erve, (and, to do him Ju&s;tice, he did it in &s;ome|what of a <HI>foren&s;ic Air</HI>) That the <HI>Par&s;on, John,</HI> and <HI>Sexton,</HI> &s;hewed inconte&s;tably the Thing to be <HI>Tripartite;</HI> now, if you will take Notice, Gentlemen, &s;ays he,
<PB N="41" REF="46">
the&s;e &s;everal Per&s;ons, who are Parties to this In&s;trument, are merely Eccle&s;ia&s;tical; that the <HI>Reading-De&s;k, Pulpit-Cloth,</HI> and <HI>Velvet Cu&s;hion,</HI> are tripartite too; and are, by Intendment of Law, Goods and Chat|tles merely of an Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Nature, be|longing and appertaining 'only unto them,' <HI>and to them only.</HI>&mdash;So that it appears very plain to me, That the <HI>Romance,</HI> neither directly nor indirectly, goes upon Tempo|ral, but altogether upon Church-Matters.&mdash;And do not you think, &s;ays he, &s;often|ing his Voice a little, and addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to the Par&s;on with a forced Smile,&mdash;Do not you think Doctor, &s;ays he, That the Di&s;pute in the <HI>Romance,</HI> between the <HI>Par&s;on</HI> of the Pari&s;h and <HI>John,</HI> about the Height of <HI>John</HI>'s De&s;k, is a very fine Pa|negyrick upon the <HI>Humility</HI> of <HI>Church-Men?</HI>&mdash;I think, &s;ays the Par&s;on, it is much of the &s;ame Finene&s;s with that which your Profe&s;&s;ion is complimented with, in the pimping, dirty, pettyfogging Character of <HI>Trim,</HI>&mdash;which, in my Opinion, Sir, is ju&s;t &s;uch another Panegyrick upon the <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> of <HI>Attornies.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing whets the Spirits like an In|&s;ult:&mdash;Therefore the Par&s;on went on with
<PB N="42" REF="47">
a vi&s;ible Superiority and an uncommon Acutene&s;s.&mdash;As you are &s;o happy, Sir, continues he, in making Applications,&mdash;pray turn over a Page or two to the black Law-Letters in the <HI>Romance.</HI>&mdash;What do you think of them, Sir?&mdash;Nay,&mdash;pray read the Grant of the <HI>Great Watch-Coat</HI>&mdash;and <HI>Trim</HI>'s Renunciation of the <HI>Breeches.</HI>&mdash;Why, there is downright <HI REND="blackletterType">Lea&s;e</HI> and <HI REND="blackletterType">Relea&s;e</HI> for you,&mdash;'tis the very Thing, Man;&mdash;only with this &s;mall Difference,&mdash;and in which con&s;i&s;ts the whole Strength of the Panegyric,&mdash;That the Author of the <HI>Romance</HI> has convey'd and re-convey'd, in about ten Lines,&mdash;what you, with the glo|rious Prolixity of the Law, could not have crowded into as many Skins of Parch|ment.</P>
<P>The Apothecary, who had paid the At|torney, the &s;ame Afternoon, a Demand of Three Pounds Six Shillings and Eight-Pence, for much &s;uch another Jobb,&mdash;was &s;o highly tickled with the Par&s;on's Repartee in that particular Point,&mdash;that he rubb'd his Hands together mo&s;t fer|vently,&mdash;and laugh'd mo&s;t triumphantly thereupon.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="48">
This could not e&s;cape the Attorney's Notice, any more than the Cau&s;e of it did e&s;cape his Penetration.</P>
<P>I think, Sir, &s;ays he, (dropping his Voice a Third) you might well have &s;pared this immoderate Mirth, &s;ince you and your Profe&s;&s;ion have the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to tri|umph here of any of us.&mdash;I beg, quoth he, that you would reflect a Moment up|on the <HI>Cob-Web</HI> which <HI>Trim</HI> went &s;o far for, and brought back with an Air of &s;o much Importance, in his Breeches Pocket, to lay upon the Par&s;on's cut Finger.&mdash;This &s;aid Cob-Web, Sir, is a fine-&s;pun Satyre, upon the flim&s;y Nature of one Half of the Shop-Medicines, with which you make a Property of the Sick, the Ig|norant, and the Un&s;u&s;pecting.&mdash;And as for the Moral of the <HI>Clo&s;e-Stool-Pan,</HI> Sir, 'tis too plain,&mdash;Does not nine Parts in ten of the whole Practice, and of all you vend under <HI>its Colours,</HI> pa&s;s into and con|center in that one na&s;ty Uten&s;il?&mdash;And let me tell you, Sir, &s;ays he, rai&s;ing his Voice,&mdash;had not your un&s;ea&s;onable Mirth blinded you, you might have &s;een that <HI>Trim</HI>'s carrying the Clo&s;e-Stool-Pan upon his Head the whole Length of the Town,

without blu&s;hing, is a pointed Raillery,&mdash;and one of the &s;harpe&s;t Sarca&s;ms, Sir, that ever was thrown out upon you;&mdash;for it unveils the &s;olemn Impudence of the whole Profe&s;&s;ion, who, I &s;ee, are a&s;hamed of no|thing which brings in Money.</P>
<P>There were two Apothecaries in the Club, be&s;ides the Surgeon mentioned be|fore, with a Chemi&s;t and an Undertaker, who all felt them&s;elves equally hurt and aggrieved by this di&s;courteous Retort:&mdash;And they were all five ri&s;ing up together from their Chairs, with full Intent of Heart, as it was thought, to return the <HI>Reproof Va|liant</HI> thereupon.&mdash;But the Pre&s;ident, fear|ing it would end in a general Engagement, he in&s;tantly call'd out, <HI>To Order;</HI>&mdash;and gave Notice, That if there was any Member in the Club, who had not yet &s;poke, and yet did de&s;ire to &s;peak upon the main Sub|ject of the Debate,&mdash;that he &s;hould im|mediately be heard.</P>
<P>This was a happy Invitation for a &s;tam|mering Member, who, it &s;eems, had but a weak Voice at the be&s;t; and having often attempted to &s;peak in the Debate, but to
<PB N="45" REF="50">
no Purpo&s;e, had &s;at down in utter De&s;pair of an Opportunity.</P>
<P>This Member, you mu&s;t know, had got a &s;ad Cru&s;h upon his Hip, in the late <HI>Election,</HI> which gave him intolerable An|gui&s;h;&mdash;&s;o that, in &s;hort, he could think of nothing el&s;e:&mdash;For which Cau&s;e, and others, he was &s;trongly of Opinion, That the whole <HI>Romance</HI> was a ju&s;t Gird at the late <HI>York</HI> Election; and I think, &s;ays he, that the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Breeches</HI> broke, may well and truly &s;ignify <HI>Somebody's el&s;e Promi&s;e,</HI> which was broke, and occa&s;ion'd &s;o much Di&s;turbance among&s;t us.</P>
<P>&mdash;Thus every Man turn'd the Story to what was &s;wimming uppermo&s;t in his own Brain;&mdash;&s;o that, before all was over, there were full as many Satyres &s;pun out of it,&mdash;and as great a Variety of Per&s;on|ages, Opinions, Tran&s;actions, and Truths, found to lay hid under the dark Veil of its Allegory, as ever were di&s;covered in the thrice-renowned Hi&s;tory of the Acts of <HI>Gargantua</HI> and <HI>Pantagruel.</HI></P>
<P>At the Clo&s;e of all, and ju&s;t before the Club was going to break up,&mdash;Mr. Pre&s;i|dent
<PB N="46" REF="51">
ro&s;e from his Chair, and begg'd Leave to make the two following Motions, which were in&s;tantly agreed to, without any Divi&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Gentlemen, &s;ays he, as <HI>Trim</HI>'s Character in the <HI>Romance,</HI> of a &s;huffling intriguing Fellow,&mdash;whoever it was drawn for, is, in Truth, as like the <HI>French King</HI> as it can &s;tare,&mdash;I move, That the <HI>Ro|mance</HI> be forthwith <HI>printed:</HI>&mdash;For, conti|nues he, if we can but once turn the Laugh again&s;t him, and make him a&s;ham'd of what he has done, it may be a great Means, with the Ble&s;&s;ing of God upon our Fleets and Armies, to &s;ave the Liberties of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Place, I move, That Mr. Attorney, our worthy Member, be de&s;ired to take Minutes, upon the Spot, of every Conjecture which has been made upon the <HI>Romance,</HI> by the &s;everal Mem|bers who have &s;poke; which, I think, &s;ays he, will an&s;wer two good Ends:</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t,</HI> It will e&s;tabli&s;h the Political Know|ledge of our Club for ever, and place it in a re&s;pectable Light to all the World.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="52">
In the <HI>next</HI> Place, it will furni&s;h what will be wanted; that is, a <HI>Key</HI> to the <HI>Ro|mance.</HI>&mdash;In troth you might have &s;aid a whole Bunch of <HI>Keys,</HI> quoth a White|&s;mith, who was the only Member in the Club who had not &s;aid &s;omething in the Debate: But let me tell you, Mr. Pre&s;i|dent, &s;ays he, That the <HI>Right Key,</HI> if it could but be found, would be worth the whole Bunch put together.</P>
