<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief Thing I purpo&s;e in the following Lines, is to vindicate the <HI>Japone&s;es</HI> from that unju&s;t Character this Part of the World is plea&s;ed to give them, <HI>viz.</HI> of being a People much given to Super&s;tition. What Rea&s;ons they had who fir&s;t &s;poke &s;o of them, I cannot tell, but this I am &s;ure of, that no People under the Sun are farther from it than they are, as will more fully appear by the fol|lowing Dialogue.</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed, the meaner &s;ort of People are wholly led by Prie&s;t|craft, and &s;o are made to believe what the <HI>Bonzes</HI> plea&s;e: But as for the finer and better Sort, they
<PB REF="4">
would have you to know they &s;corn to captivate their Rea&s;ons to a few Writings of their Law-givers, con|&s;trued and altered (as they humbly conceive) by the Prie&s;ts, who&s;e Intere&s;t is to keep People in the greate&s;t Ignorance and Subje|ction.</P>
<P>I hope therefore that my &s;etting of 'em in a fair Light, will be taken by the World as a great Ar|gument of my Candor and Gene|ro&s;ity; and having this <HI>Collo|quium</HI> fre&s;h &s;till in my Memory, which I know will go a greater Way by far in vindicating them than all I could &s;ay of my own Head, I thought it would agree better with the Character I hope to gain by this, to publi&s;h it ju&s;t as I heard it, be|cau&s;e you have here the <HI>Japanner</HI> &s;tanding up for his Nation, as well as him&s;elf, and al&s;o a <HI>Formo&s;an</HI>
<PB REF="5">
making his Objections with the <HI>Ja|pone&s;e</HI>'s An&s;wers to them; &s;o that the whole Matter being ju&s;tly and impartially laid before you, the Rea|der may the better judge as he &s;hall &s;ee meet, and that I take to be the only hone&s;t way of dealing with Readers.</P>
<P>And I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that tho' I was Con&s;cious of my Ignorance of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, yet I would by no means &s;uffer any Body to me|thodize or correct it, becau&s;e I was afraid le&s;t the Reader &s;hould hence find Occa&s;ion of &s;u&s;pecting the Sin|cerity of my Narrative. Wherefore I here mu&s;t beg of him to excu&s;e all the Faults he &s;hall find in the Lan|guage, which he cannot rea&s;onably expect a Stranger to be free from, e&s;pecially in &s;uch a refin'd one, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at pre&s;ent is.</P>
<P>I flatter my &s;elf with the Hopes,
<PB REF="6">
that it will be not a little entertain|ing, the Que&s;tions therein handled bearing &s;o near a Re&s;emblance to the Di&s;putes, which make &s;o much Noi&s;e here at pre&s;ent. You'll &s;ee a <HI>Japanner,</HI> who out of meer Friend|&s;hip and kindne&s;s comes to free a Man from the Bondage of Prie&s;t|craft, Prejudice, and Ignorance; and on the other &s;ide, you'll &s;ee a <HI>For|mo&s;an,</HI> like a willing Pri&s;oner, en|deavouring to bring his Friend unto the &s;ame Condition as he is him&s;elf; and both u&s;ing all the Arguments they are Ma&s;ters of to|wards effecting their De&s;ign.</P>
<P>However, that the Reader may not expect more of me than he is likely to find at the long run, and &s;o be obliged to throw away the Book in a Fury, it will be very nece&s;&s;ary to tell him, that tho' I was &s;o for|tunate to be pre&s;ent at the opening
<PB REF="7">
of the Conference, yet I was un|luckily call'd away upon &s;ome very earne&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o that I could not &s;tay for the Conclu&s;ion, which was however &s;o near at Hand, that if he will take the &s;ame Liberty of gue&s;|&s;ing as I have done, he'll be able to find out which way the Victory turned: However, 'twill &s;till an|&s;wer my De&s;ign, which is to vindi|cate the <HI>Japanner,</HI> when the Rea|der ob&s;erves him all along arguing not like a Bigot, but like a Man of a <HI>free born Under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>One Favour more I mu&s;t beg of my Reader, is, that if he finds ei|ther of my <HI>Di&s;putants</HI> to be out in his <HI>Logick, Philo&s;ophy,</HI> or <HI>Divi|nity,</HI> he would not think the wor&s;e of me, or think me guilty of the &s;ame Errors in my private Opi|nions; as <HI>v. g.</HI> if one of them &s;hould happen to affirm Fire to be
<PB REF="8">
bot, contrary to the Modern Philo|&s;ophers, who affirm it to be cold: For as I have re&s;olved not to omit any of their Arguments, or dimi|ni&s;h the Strength of 'em, &s;o nei|ther will I add any thing to it; but &s;uch Blunders as they &s;hall commit, let them an&s;wer for them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>A DIALOGUE Between A <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> and a <HI>Formo&s;an,</HI> About &s;ome Points of The RELIGION of the TIME.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, you are heartily welcome to <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> it is &s;o long &s;ince we were ble&s;t with your Company, that I almo&s;t de&s;pair'd ever of enjoy|ing it again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I value yours &s;o much, that had I not been detain'd by Bu&s;ine&s;s, I had not been &s;o great a Stranger: But to tell you the Truth, I fell into the Ac|quaintance of &s;ome Gentlemen of great Parts, who made me freely acquainted with &s;ome new Notions of theirs which
<PB N="2" REF="10">
put me for &s;ome time into a brown Stu|dy, till at la&s;t, partly by their help, and partly by my own Application, I came to &s;ettle my Mind on the Matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you talk of Learned Men, pray give me leave to ask you how your Friend does?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>Meaning who?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the Prie&s;t that was here la&s;t time with you; do not you remem|ber?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes! Why I think he's well; but have &s;een him but once &s;ince I was here la&s;t: For you mu&s;t know we fell out mightily that time upon certain Points of Religion; and I believe ne|ver will be reconciled; at lea&s;t I never will with him, whatever he does with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="11">
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, fallen out with a Prie&s;t? I am &s;orry for that, with all my Heart. I thought you had more Re&s;pect for Men of his <HI>Robe</HI> and <HI>Dignity.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Fig for their Dignity and all that belongs to them; they &s;hall never catch me with &s;uch Chimeras again, I'll promi&s;e you; I have been their Fool and Slave long enough, to my &s;hame be it &s;poken; but now, I thank my Stars, I am grown a little wi&s;er, and have &s;hook off the Yoak, and &s;et my &s;elf free from their pretended Autho|rity; and to be plain with you, this is the very Bu&s;ine&s;s: The&s;e Gentlemen I was telling you of, communicated me, and which indeed did give me no little Trouble; but I am at pre&s;ent &s;o &s;ati&s;|fied of the Prie&s;t's Confidence in claim|ing any Authority, that I wonder how any Man can be &s;o be&s;otted as to ac|knowledge it. Neither is this my Opi|nion only, but al&s;o that of the greate&s;t Wits of our Age; tho' indeed, I mu&s;t own, it never broke out &s;o plainly as it has done within the&s;e Two Years, yet you mu&s;t needs think it had been a long while a brewing before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="12">
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a &s;udden alteration indeed, and &s;uch as I little dreamed of; but for G&mdash;d's &s;ake, Sir, do you con&s;ider what you are a doing? Do not you know that Prie&s;ts derive their Authority from the Law-givers, and their Law|givers from God? So that you cannot deny that of the one, without rebel|ling at the &s;ame time again&s;t the Two others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho! One may &s;ee plain enough: You live in a Land of Darkne&s;s and Ignorance, wholly influenced by Prie&s;t|craft; were you but to live 3 Months in <HI>Yedo</HI> or <HI>Meako,</HI> you would &s;ee what a refined Air we breath, and what a Learned Age we live in; and I don't doubt but the changing of Climate would make you alter your Notions. You cannot go into any Book-&s;eller's Shop, but you may &s;ee there &s;ome Books again&s;t the Authority of the Prie&s;ts; nay, even of the Law-givers them&s;elves; &s;o that in a &s;hort time, I hope, we'll &s;end them both a packing,
<PB N="5" REF="13">
which Work, if once done, will immor|talize this Generation; in&s;omuch, that I would not for the whole Empire be to be born in the next.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay if the&s;e be the Effects of your Climate, I'll e'en tarry at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may do what you plea&s;e for that, but I'll a&s;&s;ure you what I &s;ay is po&s;itively true; and the Authority of the Law-givers as well as of the Prie&s;ts is &s;inking down as fa&s;t as&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>You fill me with wonders, I pro|te&s;t&mdash;What, all the Writings of the Law-givers which have been &s;o long in the greate&s;t Veneration and Credit, oppo&s;ed now with &s;uch Violence? I thought it was &s;o well grounded, and &s;o univer&s;ally received, &s;o well con|firm'd by Miracles, that it was not in the Power of Man to overthrow it. But pray what Arguments do they make u&s;e of to overthrow the Authority of &s;uch great Men as <HI>Amida, Xakha, Camba|doxi,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="14">
and the re&s;t, who have ever been reverenc'd as Gods from the Time of their leaving the World? And what do the Prie&s;ts &s;ay to all the&s;e? Do they not oppo&s;e it with all their Strength and Might? I &s;hould think 'tis their Inte|re&s;t as well as their Duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>There have been a few who have endeavoured to do it, but after &s;uch a way, that it does more Good than Di&s;&s;ervice to our Cau&s;e. The genera|lity of them hold their Tongues; but however, this is agreed on by all the ju|dicious Per&s;ons, that our Arguments are unan&s;werable. I &s;hould have told you, that there is one (not a Prie&s;t) who pretends to an&s;wer it not all at once, but piece by piece; <HI>viz.</HI> to Day one, to Morrow another; but his Cha|racter is already &s;o blackned&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e by &s;ome of your Party on purpo&s;e to render him odious, and &s;o hinder People from reading his Papers. But pray what are the&s;e Arguments of yours, that you &s;ay all judicious Per|&s;ons
<PB N="7" REF="15">
own to be unan&s;werable, how do you know but if they appear &s;o to me, I'll be one of your Pro&s;elytes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Arguments! You mi&s;take me, Sir, I do not give them you as my own, neither would I have you to think that I am of their Mind, for they go upon one Ground and I upon another: Be|&s;ides, I don't carry the thing &s;o far by half as they do, I do a&s;&s;ure you; but however you &s;hall hear what they &s;ay.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t &s;ays one, If the Writings of <HI>Amida, Xakha, Cambadoxi,</HI> and other Law-givers do give the lea&s;t Authority to the Prie&s;ts over the People, then we may &s;afely &s;ay, they are of their own inventing; or el&s;e the&s;e Law-givers in the &s;tead of being encouraged and admired while alive, and deified and wor&s;hipped after their Deaths, de&s;erved rather to be puni&s;hed and made to &s;uffer the mo&s;t ignominious Deaths that ever Slave was put to, as being U&s;urpers of that Power lodg'd in every Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="16">
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Power do they mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, you mu&s;t know they'll have it to be, that neither Kings, nor God him&s;elf has any Power over Men, but what they have receiv'd from them. Now what do you &s;ay to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then God's Dominion and Power over us is as much denied as that of the Prie&s;ts: Is it not what I told you from the fir&s;t, that we could not refu&s;e our Submi&s;&s;ion to the latter, without turning Rebels to the former? How|ever, I did not much wonder at Peo|ple rebelling again&s;t the Prie&s;ts. But that Men &s;hould attack God's Autho|rity &s;o publickly, is &s;omething a|mazing to me. For I never thought that Men in their Sen&s;es would go to deny that as they had to their Co&s;t &s;o often felt; I mean the Judgments he has &s;ent to Men for their Sins. The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> tell us of an univer&s;al Flood: We can produce &s;ome &s;uch Puni&s;h|ments
<PB N="9" REF="17">
in our Hi&s;tory; and as for yours, it is brimful of 'em. Now this is a certain Sign of God's Power over us. Therefore either we mu&s;t &s;ay, that it was evilly gotten, namely, by U&s;ur|pation; or el&s;e we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Rea&s;on as well as the Wri|tings of the Law-givers tells us indeed, that God did give us Being, but not that he did give us any Power over it, and much le&s;s that we gave it him back again; and if we have not this Power in us, how can we pretend to give it to Kings, or any Body el&s;e? No Body can give what he has not him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But farther, granting that Rea&s;on goes very near to tell us, that we have a Power over our &s;elves; yet if the Writings of our Prophets, whom we have all the Rea&s;ons in the World to believe were &s;ent from God, do a&s;&s;ure us of the contrary; ought not our Rea&s;on to give place to them? Be&s;ides, that &s;ame Rea&s;on that tells me I have that Power, tells me al&s;o, that he who gave me Being, gave me that Power over it; and if &s;o he can take it from us when ever he plea&s;es: So that which
<PB N="10" REF="18">
way &s;oever we look, we'll find <HI>God</HI>'s Power and Authority <HI>to be over all his Works.</HI></P>
<P>One thing I wonder mightily at, is, that neither the Emperor, nor the High Prie&s;ts &s;hould hinder &s;uch Doctrines from taking Ground: For, if People are once per&s;waded that the Power of Kings and Prie&s;ts is derived from the People, nothing can hinder them from withdrawing it when ever they &s;ee Oc|ca&s;ion; &s;o that neither of 'em can be &s;afe on their Thrones.</P>
<P>Then as to the Argument, <HI>viz.</HI> that if the Writings of <HI>Amida, &amp;c.</HI> does give any Power to the Prie&s;ts, then it is of their own inventing, is to me not only a very bold, but al&s;o a mo&s;t &s;en&s;e|le&s;s A&s;&s;ertion. For how is it po&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch a Nation as yours &s;hould have all the&s;e Stories impo&s;ed upon you by a few Prie&s;ts; nay, not only yours, but al&s;o other neighbouring Nations, &s;uch as <HI>China, Tartary,</HI> &amp;c, in a Time when Learning &s;eemed to flouri&s;h in every one of 'em, erected, and made other Countries erect Statues
<PB N="11" REF="19">
to the&s;e pretended Gods; &s;uppo&s;e their Writings, which, as it might be made appear the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> them&s;elves copied while the Authors of them were alive, all the&s;e and &s;everal other Circum&s;tances make it a Demon&s;tration to me, that it was not in the Power of the Prie&s;ts to put &s;uch notorious Cheats upon &s;o many Nations together.</P>
<P>Neither can it be &s;aid, that the Prie&s;ts did alter the&s;e Writings; for as I told you before, &s;o many other Peo|ple having had Copies of 'em from the Beginning, and kept 'em ever &s;ince; and &s;ince they do all agree, it is un|rea&s;onable to think that ever they did &s;uffer the lea&s;t Corruption.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, do but con&s;ider the va|rious Sects, that are and have been in <HI>Japan</HI> ever &s;ince the Departure of the Law-givers, which Sects are in conti|nual Di&s;putes one with another about &s;ome Points of Religion, The&s;e Di&s;|putes do not ari&s;e from any Difference of the Copies, but from the Darkne&s;s of the Writings. Now had any one of the Sects gone to make any Altera|tion
<PB N="12" REF="20">
to &s;erve their Turn, the others would have immediately expo&s;ed them, or done the &s;ame them&s;elves, neither of which can be proved. Therefore it mu&s;t be owned that the&s;e Writings are the &s;ame that <HI>Amida, Xakha,</HI> &amp;c. wrote them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And &s;ince it does appear by all the Circum&s;tances that accompanied their Lives, as well during, as before and after it, that they were Men &s;ent from the Great GOD to give Laws, and to e&s;tabli&s;h his Wor&s;hip: And &s;ince, as I have proved, GOD has a Power over his Creatures, if the&s;e Prophets did claim any to them&s;elves, we ought to think that they had it from GOD, and that whom&s;oever they did communicate it to, might ju&s;tly, nay, were bound to exerci&s;e it in their &s;everal Stations. Which leads me to the re&s;t of the Argument, namely, that if <HI>Amida,</HI> &amp;c. are the true Authors of the&s;e Writings, they de&s;erv'd to be put to Death for pretending to any Authority, or to give it to others; which is indeed a very &s;evere and un|ju&s;t Sentence: For the&s;e that were &s;ent
<PB N="13" REF="21">
from GOD mu&s;t &s;urely know better to whom that Power belonged, and con&s;equently could lay the &s;urer Foun|dations; and yet we &s;ee that they were &s;o far from pretending to any Authority, in Matters of Civil Go|vernment, that they renounced it as contrary to their Profe&s;&s;ion; nay, they enjoin'd all their Followers to obey tho&s;e that were put in Authority over 'em; and &s;ettled the King's Rights up|on the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t Foundations that ever were, <HI>viz.</HI> on God's Autho|rity and Commands, his Rewards and Puni&s;hments. Now therefore, &s;ince all the Authority they claim, is only concerning Spiritual Matters, can any body be &s;o unju&s;t as to think them guilty of Death? Or &s;o incredulous as to refu&s;e them their Obedience, and &s;hut their Eyes to the great Proofs they bring of their ju&s;t Right to &s;uch Authority?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, hear what another Learn|ed Author &s;ays to this, <Q>There being &s;uch great Rea&s;ons for re&s;pecting and reverencing tho&s;e Men who are
<PB N="14" REF="22">
&s;ent from GOD; this might very well have pu&s;hed on &s;ome proud, ambitious Fellows to pretend to &s;uch Mi&s;&s;ion: But however (continueth he) if the&s;e Men do claim to them|&s;elves any Power over Men, we may ju&s;tly and lawfully &s;u&s;pect them.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>What I have &s;aid to the la&s;t Argu|ment will in &s;ome Mea&s;ure an&s;wer this; however, I'll add this, that as it is not the&s;e Men's bare Saying they are &s;ent from God, that ought to make us believe them &s;o; neither can &s;uch a &s;illy Exception as that of their pretending to &s;ome Authority, be a &s;ufficient Pre|tence for our rejecting of 'em. Every Man that pretends to be &s;ent from GOD, mu&s;t do &s;omething to confirm his Mi&s;&s;ion: Wherefore we &s;ee that all of 'em have wrought &s;ome kind of Mi|racles, then is it left to us to judge whether the&s;e Miracles were real and true ones, &s;uch as none but GOD, or them whom his Hand was with could work, or whether they were meer jug|ling Tricks. Now, that there have been &s;ome of the latter Stamp, every
<PB N="15" REF="23">
where mu&s;t be owned, becau&s;e they have been di&s;covered; and &s;ome re|ceived their Puni&s;hment in this World. But however, this can never be an Argument again&s;t the former. What Miracles <HI>Amida, Cambadoxy,</HI> &amp;c. have wrought, is &s;ufficiently known to the World, and by every impartial Man own'd to be above every Power but GOD's. It will be al&s;o granted, that God will never help Men in &s;o parti|cular a manner, to deceive People, and confirm an Impo&s;ture; it will there|fore follow, that the&s;e Prophets chal|lenging a Power in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Mat|ters, can be no &s;ufficent Bulwark again&s;t tho&s;e &s;trong Proofs given us by God him&s;elf in behalf of them. How ridiculous then would it look in me, becau&s;e I believe without any (or to &s;peak more properly) again&s;t all Rea|&s;on, that I am my own King, and that no Body has Power over me, but him whom I give it to, how fooli&s;h, I &s;ay, would it be in me to go to deny &s;uch &s;trong Evidence! Becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, it contradicts that Notion of mine, and demands that Submi&s;&s;ion of me, which I thought I did owe no Bo|dy
<PB N="16" REF="24">
but whom I plea&s;ed to give it freely.</P>
<P>Now farther, I would ask you whe|ther you know of any Law-giver that did not pretend to this Authority, I don't believe you can produce one: So then we mu&s;t at that Rate throw away all manner of Revelation, and go to the Play of <HI>Blind-mans-buff,</HI> or rather to the Childrens Play of <HI>Hide and Seek,</HI> we mu&s;t &s;hut our Eyes to this Light we have, and let our &s;hal|low Brains go and look for another. Now what can &s;uch a &s;hort-leg'd Jade as Rea&s;on ridden and led by Intere&s;t, Self-love, and many other &s;uch Blind and Sini&s;ter Rulers, find, but a Reli|gion &s;uitable to every one of them, and con&s;equently as far from God as he is from them. You &s;ee therefore, that while we endeavour to &s;et Rea|&s;on free, as we think, we rather make her the more a Slave, and in the &s;tead of one Ma&s;ter, <HI>viz.</HI> GOD, we find her Forty; &s;uch as Pride, Ambition, In|tere&s;t, Self-love, and Four and Thir|ty more of the like nature.</P>

To conclude therefore, &s;ince we find by woeful Experience, 1. how &s;hort|&s;ighted and weak our Rea&s;on is, and how unable of it &s;elf of finding the right Wor&s;hip of God; and &s;econdly, that God in Compa&s;&s;ion to this our Infirmity, did in&s;pire &s;ome Men to come and teach it; and has confirm'd their Doctrine with &s;o many Signs and Wonders, &s;uch as do not leave us the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion to doubt of it's coming from him; it will follow, that the&s;e in&s;pired Men, as well as their Succe&s;|&s;ors, not only might ju&s;tly, but al&s;o were and are in Duty bound to ex|erci&s;e this Authority which God gave 'em in their &s;everal Stations, and all the re&s;t are of Con&s;equence obliged to obey.</P>

<P>If the foregoing Arguments had been (as you &s;aid, <HI>all ingenious Per|&s;ons own)</HI> unan&s;werable, then this would have followed of Cour&s;e. But as we have &s;tated this Power, <HI>viz.</HI> up|on the inconte&s;table Power of the Law-giver, which was immediately and undoubtedly derived from God; their Author had as good tell me, that I have as much Right to go and &s;it in the Emperor's Privy-Council, or to lead his Army, as tho&s;e whom he has cho&s;en to it. However, not to take too much upon me, in pretending to know Religion better than your &s;elf: You may &s;atisfie your &s;elf this way, if by the Writings of the <HI>Law-givers,</HI> and other Authentick Hi&s;tories, it do not appear that <HI>Amida, Xakha,</HI> &amp;c. cho&s;e them&s;elves Succe&s;&s;ors from a|mong
<PB N="19" REF="27">
their DI&s;ciples, whom, and whom alone they communicated this Power to. But on the contrary, if it does ap|pear, that they gave Power to every one, and that they accordingly made u&s;e of it, then your Hypothe&s;is &s;tands firm enough; then the Door-keeper's Cook|maid can claim as much Right as the Prie&s;t: but if I mi&s;take not, both the Prophet's Writings, and the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Times tell us quite different things: In the Fir&s;t we read, that they cho&s;e &s;ome Men, whom in a particular manner they inve&s;ted with that Power of Preaching, and performing the Cere|monies of Divine Wor&s;hip; and that the&s;e Cho&s;en Men did do the &s;ame to others as the Doctrine did propagate. In the Second we have no mention of any particular Congregation, which was not with a Prie&s;t, not cho&s;en as <HI>a Servant,</HI> but ordained by other Prie&s;ts in a higher Degree, which has conti|nued from that time till this.</P>
<P>Now if you can from what has been &s;aid, find out your Author to be in the right, you had as good be of his Mind &s;till; but if the contrary,
<PB N="20" REF="28">
then I would advi&s;e you to put up that Pride of yours, and return to your pri|mitive State, and con&s;ider that the&s;e Prie&s;ts are as Amba&s;&s;adors from God; and con&s;equently ought to keep up their Dignity and Authority without bating one jot of it, con&s;idering whom they repre&s;ent: And if &s;ome Envoys have been &s;everely puni&s;hed by their Sovereigns, for doing of Things un|worthy the Per&s;ons they repre&s;ented; much more ought the&s;e Vicegerents of God to fear le&s;t by their too much facility, they make the People de|&s;pi&s;e them. Re&s;pect we cannot &s;hew 'em too much; but we can, and, I am afraid, generally do &s;hew 'em too little. However, this may always be &s;aid for us, that 'tis no Affront either to our Rea&s;on or our Manhood, to re|verence and obey the Prie&s;ts under the notion of Legates of the Almighty; be|cau&s;e then all our Submi&s;&s;ion is di|rectly paid to him, who&s;e Power and Authority over us, none but Fools and Madmen can call in question.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be plain with you, Sir, what the&s;e Gentlemen and I were alledging again&s;t the Prie&s;ts, was their impo&s;ing upon Mens Rea&s;ons things quite con|trary to it under the notions of My&s;te|ries; which they mu&s;t be either Fools for believing, or Kn&mdash;s for ma|king others believe. And this was the Thing that I told my <HI>quondam</HI> Friend that time we fell out; whereupon he was &s;o exa&s;perated at what I &s;aid to him, that he went away, and never came to me again; and I to be &s;ure was not &s;uch a Fool to go after him. Now therefore the Grounds I go upon are the&s;e; the Prie&s;ts cannot &s;tretch their
<PB N="22" REF="30">
Authority beyond the &s;et Bounds of it, without turning U&s;urpers, Tyrants, Deceivers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now when they are once liable to all the&s;e Denominations, they do no more an&s;wer the Intention of him that ordained 'em; and there|fore we may &s;afely deny them that Submi&s;&s;ion which they might have challenged, had they kept within their Compa&s;s. Now that they do de&s;erve the afore&s;aid Appellations, does &s;uffi|ciently appear by the Ab&s;urdities they crowd in their <HI>Creeds;</HI> and oblige every one under pain of Damnation mo&s;t firmly to believe: Therefore, I hope, you won't condemn me for ta|king my leave of them.</P>

<P>Before we call 'em all the&s;e odious Names, we ought to con&s;ider 2 Things; Fir&s;t, whether the Writings on which our Faith is grounded, be true or not: If they be true, whether they oblige us to believe the&s;e My&s;teries under pain of Damnation? For if they do, then the Prie&s;ts affirm no more than the Scriptures do. Now as for the Truth of the&s;e Writings, I believe we have
<PB N="23" REF="31">
&s;ufficiently &s;ettled; neither do you &s;eem to deny that Point. And as for their affirming &s;uch Doctrines, any body may be &s;atisfied that reads them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, if the&s;e Writings do tell me Contradictions, and Things that &s;hock my Rea&s;on, I mu&s;t believe them, mu&s;t I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, do but &s;ee how your great Zeal again&s;t Contradictions, leads you into a notorious one. You own the&s;e Writings to be of Authority, and at the &s;ame time &s;ay, If they teach me-Contradictions? Which is as plain a one as can be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, to &s;peak plainer, my Opinion is, that God cannot oblige us to believe Things contrary to Rea&s;on: If therefore there is any thing of that nature in the&s;e Writings, I'll very fairly reject it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="32">
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t be very &s;ure however, that the&s;e Things propo&s;ed do imply that Contradiction before you reject them; for there is no doubt, but if you find fault with one part of the Writings, you do quite overthrow the Credit and Authority of the re&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your Pardon for that, I may reject one part of them, and yet be|lieve the other, as fa&s;t as you do your whole Creed: For I don't think the whole Ma&s;s of Writings to be of that &s;ame Authority. Some there be that are undoubtedly and unque&s;tionably true, and of Divine In&s;piration; others that may be reckoned Apocriphas, tho' the Prie&s;ts would make them pa&s;s for Canonical; and there be others, which are apparently fal&s;e, which might perhaps have been very true and Authentick when fir&s;t written; but afterwards, either by the Carele&s;|ne&s;s of the Tran&s;cribers, or the Ma|lice of the Keepers, have been &s;o cor|rupted, that at pre&s;ent we may lawful|ly reject them as fal&s;e.</P>

<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, I can't &s;ay much; there may be Mi&s;takes committed by the Tran&s;cribers; yet I &s;hould think there is yet enough left of the Wri|tings in which all Copies do agree to prove the&s;e Doctrines; but as for the latter, <HI>viz.</HI> of their being corrupted by the Keepers, &s;o as to render them liable to Su&s;picion, I thought I had proved unfea&s;ible. But yet, grant all this, what <HI>Kriterion</HI> will you make u&s;e of to know which is which? That &s;eems to me a very difficult matter; and if you can furni&s;h me with any Rules for the di&s;tingui&s;hing the one from the other, <HI>eris mihi magnus Apollo.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, to &s;hew you I am not unprovided with that neither, I'll give you Three Rules, which indeed, are not the Product of my Brain; for I had 'em from one of our Party, who wrote &s;ometime ago a Book concerning <HI>In&s;piration.</HI> The whole would be worth your Reading; and if you did, I don't believe you would go away with your Bigotry, but to the Rules.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="34">
The Fir&s;t is, that <HI>Amida</HI> being the greate&s;t Law-giver, the greate&s;t Demi|god, and all the re&s;t being only Wit|ne&s;&s;es, as 'twere to him, we are obliged to believe no more than <HI>Amida</HI>'s own Writings, and that with this</P>
<P>Second Rule, that we ought to be|lieve no more even of <HI>Amida,</HI> but what we find all the Copies to agree in; and whatever we find in one of the Copies which is not, or is other|wi&s;e in another, that we may &s;afely reject.</P>
<P>The Third Rule is, that when we have &s;ummon'd up all that the Copies do agree in, I mean of <HI>Amida</HI>'s only; we are bound to believe no more of that neither than we find agreeable to our Rea&s;on. Now the&s;e be the Three Rules&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>And very good ones too, I prote&s;t: But, Sir, do you not perceive what a <HI>Credulous</HI> Man you are grown, when even you intend to be the Rever&s;e? you will not believe what God has re|vealed,
<PB N="27" REF="35">
becau&s;e it &s;eems to you again&s;t your Rea&s;on? But you can take the&s;e Rules, nay, I am confident a great part of your Gentlemen, as well as your &s;elf, can believe Things upon the Au|thority of another Man. Now, what would you think if a Man &s;hould over|throw the&s;e your Rules you depend &s;o much on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Japone&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould think he has at once undone what another has been a long while a hamering, but that I think impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Formo&s;an.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, 'tis worth aiming at; and to begin, your Author &s;ays that <HI>Amida</HI> being the greate&s;t God, and the re&s;t only Witne&s;&s;es to him; you'll believe the former, but not the latter; that's a Contradiction: For Fir&s;t, before you can believe in <HI>Amida,</HI> you mu&s;t be &s;ure that tho&s;e that witne&s;&s;ed of him are true Prophets, and do not lie: And then how can you unbelieve that again.</P>
<P>Secondly, the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es did prove the Truth of their Te&s;timony by Signs
<PB N="28" REF="36">
and Miracles, as well as <HI>Amida,</HI> and con&s;equently their Authority mu&s;t be equal, as being both confirmed by God; for a Thing, let it be ever &s;o true, can amount to no more than a Truth: I'll allow you therefore that <HI>Amida</HI> is a greater Hero in Dignity, but not in Credit than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Thirdly, You know very well that <HI>Amida</HI> refers the Authority of his Mi&s;|&s;ion to the Prophets that were before him, and bore witne&s;s of him; &s;o that if any of the Two may be que&s;tioned, it &s;hould be the former. Be&s;ides, we &s;ee that <HI>Amida</HI> &s;peaks with all the Re|&s;pect in the World of the&s;e Law-gi|vers, commends them, and in &s;hort, bears as much witne&s;s of them as they did of him: Now that a Man may be mi&s;taken in another Man, may be well &s;aid; but that a Prophet in&s;pired by God &s;hould give a good Character to an Impo&s;tor, is ab&s;urd; therefore the Authority of both, depending &s;o much upon one another, we cannot pull out one of the Pillars without bringing the whole Hou&s;e upon our Heads.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="37">
As to your Second Rule, <HI>viz.</HI> that you'll have all the Copies agree in one Article before you believe it, I'll tell you what the Con&s;equence of it will be; you mu&s;t fir&s;t take the Trou|ble to romage all the extant Copies, compare them very exactly, which by the way is no ea&s;y task, before you can &s;ettle your Religion; which, when done, may be in a little time altoge|ther de&s;troyed: For it is but bribing &s;ome Book&s;ellers or Tran&s;cribers to make a new Copy, contradicting one of your &s;ettled Articles; then off mu&s;t it go out of the Book, till at la&s;t by throwing out one Article after ano|ther, you proceed Religionle&s;s.</P>
<P>And your Third Rule, <HI>viz.</HI> of be|lieving nothing but what is agreeable to your Rea&s;on, is as comical a one as ever was invented: For fir&s;t, if it is a true one, and may be depended on, what need is there for the Two fore|going ones? If you'll believe nothing but what appears to you rea&s;onable, you need not trouble your &s;elf who it is that writ the&s;e Things, nor whe|ther
<PB N="30" REF="38">
the Copies do agree in: For let the Author be who he will, let the Copies contradict one another ever &s;o much, what is agreeable to Rea&s;on, will be &s;o &s;till for all that, and con&s;e|quently will challenge our Belief.</P>
<P>2dly, this is asmuch as if you &s;hould &s;ay, I'll believe no more of the&s;e Law|givers than I will of any other Man, nay, le&s;s: For when to my know|ledge, you have been told by &s;everal Men, that in very cold Countries they had &s;een the Water grow &s;o hard, that a Cart went over it: You have believ'd it upon the Hone&s;ty of the&s;e Relators; tho' I don't know how you'll make this and Rea&s;on agree.</P>
<P>If &s;o, what need have you to talk &s;o much of In&s;piration, Divine Autho|rity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ince it appears by this Rule that <HI>Amida, Xakha,</HI> and who&s;oever do pretend to any, may e'en go whi&s;tle with it: You'll a&s;&s;oon, if not rather believe any hone&s;t Men, as you will them with all their Divine In&s;piration. You had as good therefore coin your
<PB N="31" REF="39">
Three Rules into this one, <HI>viz. That we are not obliged to make a Di&s;tinction between a Man &s;ent from God, and an hone&s;t Learned Man, that &s;peaks of his own Head; but believe as much of either as our Rea&s;on will admit.</HI></P>
<P>What Nece&s;&s;ity was there then for God's working &s;o many and great Mi|racles, to confirm the Doctrine he re|vealed unto us, if after all, it is left to every body to &s;erve it as People do a Market, chu&s;e what be&s;t plea&s;es their Palate, and leave the re&s;t for le&s;s nice Cu&s;tomers; we might all have done that without the help of one &s;in|gle Miracle.</P>
<P>Farther, if God de&s;igned to reveal nothing to us but what was agreeable to our Rea&s;on, then that very Reve|lation was needle&s;s; for our Rea&s;on could have found it out of it &s;elf: But however, let that pa&s;s as a Suppo&s;ition, becau&s;e it is not much to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e whether it be true or no; this will however follow, that with|out the Help of any Supernatural Con|viction, we might have given our
<PB N="32" REF="40">
A&s;&s;ent to &s;uch rea&s;onable Propo&s;i|tions.</P>
<P>My Opinion therefore is, that the&s;e Law-givers were to declare to us &s;ome|thing above Rea&s;on; for which the Power of working Miracles was given them, that they might challenge our Belief to a Thing which Rea&s;on doth not comprehend; which when declar'd unto us, we mu&s;t not expect to under|&s;tand better than before; they will be above our Reach &s;till, as the Men who told you of the Water growing hard in cold Countries; they gained in|deed your A&s;&s;ent as to the matter of Fact; but as to the manner how, they left you as ignorant as they found you.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, you mu&s;t own that&punc; the Name of <HI>My&s;tery</HI> is u&s;ed in the Wri|tings of the Law-givers; under what Notion mu&s;t we under&s;tand it? Can we &s;ay, that what they call great and high My&s;teries, are only Things agreeable to Rea&s;on, but only more Sublime than the common Truths? Still does not this an&s;wer the No|tion of My&s;tery. Let us therefore
<PB N="33" REF="41">
conclude, that when the Prie&s;ts do teach us any thing that is above our Rea&s;on, under the Notion of My&s;te|ries, they do no more than the Law|givers them&s;elves have done: And if the&s;e Doctrines were My&s;teries to them that had, be&s;ides Divine In&s;piration, a great many other Advantages we want, well may they be &s;o unto us, and well may we be thought very pre&s;umptions to reject them, becau&s;e our &s;hallow Rea&s;on can't reach them.</P>
<P>Let me therefore make bold to give you the following Advice.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, always to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e Things that are above Rea&s;on, from tho&s;e that are again&s;t it. We call that Thing again&s;t Rea&s;on, that contradicts our former Ideas, framed on a due Con&s;ideration, or on &s;elf-evident Prin|ciples; as for In&s;tance, to &s;ay that Fire is cold, is again&s;t Rea&s;on; becau&s;e we have upon good Grounds conceived the Idea of Fire, as of a hot Thing. But when we come to &s;peak of God, and of his Nature, there is nothing can properly be &s;aid to contradict our Idea,
<PB N="34" REF="42">
becau&s;e we never did frame one that we could &s;ay was to be depended upon.</P>
<P>Now if we are to &s;et &s;o great Value upon tho&s;e Ideas our Rea&s;on has fra|med, how come Men all generally to agree in the Wor&s;hip of God, which is certainly again&s;t tho&s;e Ideas we had or ought to have framed of him. The Wor&s;hip of God con&s;i&s;ts in prai&s;ing of him, in praying to him for what we &s;tand in need of, and in giving Thanks for what we have received. The Idea we have of a God, is of a Being infi|nitely Good, Merciful, Ju&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We reckon up all the Excellencies that we find in Men, and attribute them to God in an infinite manner. When then we prai&s;e God, and tell of his Attri|butes, may not that &s;hock his Mode&s;ty as prai&s;ing a Man before his Face. To pray to him for any Ble&s;&s;ings, contra|dicts the Ideas we had of his Goodne&s;s and Liberality. He is no generous Per&s;on, that knows another to be in Nece&s;&s;ity, and will not relieve him till he asks for it: And &s;o to give Thanks to a generous Spirit for any Favour, is a kind of an Affront to them, like
<PB N="35" REF="43">
prai&s;ing of 'em; and much more to God, if we follow our Ideas before fram'd. I wonder therefore, that it never came into your Heads to aboli&s;h the Wor&s;hip of God, as contrary to Rea&s;on; and then you'll have a very lazy Religion, and a good Time on't.</P>
<P>Nay, what do you think to believe that God is a Spirit, is not that quite contradicting all the Ideas we had framed? And that &s;ame may al&s;o be &s;aid of believing God to be Infinite, Eternal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For our Under&s;tanding is too little to receive any Ideas, but what are limited to Time, Place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Infinity, Eternity, being infinitely too large to &s;queeze into &s;uch narrow Compa&s;s, are forced to lie without Doors. Farther, ask that Rea&s;on of yours that will believe nothing that contradicts it, how &s;he comes to be|lieve God's <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> and his Attributes, to be the &s;ame without Compo&s;ition; for it is certain, it will always apprehend his Wi&s;dom and Power as di&s;tinct, his <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> as oppo&s;ite. How can we believe God to be intire in all Places, and yet not circum&s;cribed to
<PB N="36" REF="44">
any; that he penetrates all Sub&s;tance, and is mixed with none; that he un|der&s;tands without the Reception of any <HI>Idea;</HI> that he loves without Pa&s;|&s;ion, is angry without Di&s;turbance, repents without Change, and &s;o many other Perfections that are e&s;&s;ential to his Godhead; ask your Rea&s;on, I &s;ay, whether it does fully under&s;tand them, and it will an&s;wer negatively; why then do you believe 'em. It is evident therefore, that it was left even to Rea&s;on to clip Religion, till it thought it enough, it would not cea&s;e, till it had made it imperceptible to the nice&s;t Eye.</P>
<P>Sccondly, before we can po&s;itively affirm, that a Propo&s;ition implies a Contradiction, we mu&s;t be &s;ure, that the contradictory Idea we had fram'd before, is well grounded. For In|&s;tance, before we can &s;ay, that 'tis a Contradiction to a&s;&s;irm that the Sun is cold or dark, we mu&s;t be &s;ure that he is both hot and light. But when we come to &s;peak of Things above Rea|&s;on's reach, we cannot &s;ay, that the Doctrine of <HI>Amida</HI> concerning God,
<PB N="37" REF="45">
contradicts our Rea&s;on, becau&s;e we can never be &s;o confident of our for|mer Notion of his Being; but we may reject them upon better Autho|rity, without offering any Affront to our Rea&s;on: Therefore, tho' we might very well think our Notions extraor|dinary good and firm at fir&s;t, <HI>i. e.</HI> be|fore the Revelation; yet when God's Authority comes and tells us the con|trary, I think <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> her &s;elf will think it mo&s;t <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> to give place.</P>
<P>Thirdly, how do you know but one time or other, if not here, at lea&s;t in the next World, our Under|&s;tandings will be opened &s;o, that (tho' at pre&s;ent they cannot &s;o much as &s;ee the po&s;&s;ibility of the&s;e <HI>Arcana)</HI> yet, then they &s;hall &s;ee all the&s;e plainly, even &s;o far as to be a&s;hamed of our Dulne&s;s, while on this &s;ide the Grave; and yet this is the Promi&s;e of one of the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Amida.</HI></P>
<P>What a heavy Rout would not a raw, untaught, Country Plow-man make, if you &s;hould go to per&s;wade him that the World turneth round as

<P>How many Things are there which have appeared contrary to Rea&s;on, impo&s;&s;ible, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which either by a more mature Con&s;ideration, or by ex|perience, have been made as clear as the Sun! And if we may be allow'd to compare mean little Things to great ones, I'll tell you a Story, not foreign to our purpo&s;e. A Centleman in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> having a mind to make him&s;elf merry with &s;ome of his Fellow-Ma|thematicians, came one Day to 'em
<PB N="39" REF="47">
with a chearful Countenance, and told them, He had found the way to make an Egg &s;tand on end on a Ta|ble, without any other Support at all; upon which they all &s;tood amaz'd; and after having debated the Matter &s;eriou&s;ly, they voted it <HI>Nemine Contra|dicente</HI> impo&s;&s;ible, and thought he was in je&s;t; wherefore to &s;hew he was in earne&s;t, took the Egg, and broke one end flat, and &s;o &s;et it to &s;tand up|on the Table.</P>

<P>When they &s;aw the Thing done, the next Word one &s;poke, was, I could have done it. Ble&s;s me! cries another, that I &s;hould not have thought on't. You &s;ee, by this, a Thing which ap|peared impo&s;&s;ible to a whole Compa|ny of truly learned Men, which when &s;hewn, nothing &s;eems ea&s;ier; I need not make any Application.</P>
<P>A certain Gentleman of your Par|ty wrote a Book in vindication of your
<PB N="40" REF="48">
Opinion, and concludes with the&s;e Words, That he refers his farther Conviction till the next World. I would not advi&s;e you to do the &s;ame, it will not be time then. And I had as good fancy fir&s;t, that a Man may be &s;aved without Holine&s;s, and &s;o wal|low in Sin all his Life-time, and refer his farther Conviction, and if need be his Conver&s;ion till the Day of Judg|ment; I think their Ca&s;e would not be much unlike, unle&s;s it be that the fir&s;t might have more Right to plead Igno|than the latter: You &s;ee I have been obliged to &s;tand up for your Religion, as much as if it had my own, and that becau&s;e we in our Religion have our My&s;teries as well as you in yours; and are bound to obey, re&s;pect and reve|verence our Prie&s;ts as well as you yours.

to &s;ee the Conclu&s;ion; and therefore I mu&s;t here leave off entreating the kind Reader not to cen&s;ure me for ma|king the <HI>Japanner</HI> begin a Speech, and not end it; as if I &s;hould go by the common Proverb, which &s;ays, that Pari&s;h-Clerks, Women and Fools will always &s;peak the la&s;t Word; which was very far from my Thoughts; but intending from the beginning to be as ju&s;t in this Relation as I could, I thought it would be took as an Argu|ment of my great Sincerity, not to omit even Three &s;uch in&s;ignificant Words as, <HI>But now, Sir.</HI></P>
