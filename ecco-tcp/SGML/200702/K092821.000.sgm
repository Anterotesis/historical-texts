<P>THE point here in&s;i&s;ted on is of the greate&s;t moment, tho' the lea&s;t regarded, or rightly under&s;tood. &mdash; Many think they truly know it, when they have but crude, carnal, indi|ge&s;ted notions of the &s;ame; which dead faith, not purifying their con&s;cience, and giving true peace, they are obliged to &s;upport by pa&s;t experience, frames, feelings, or works; and when they hear tho&s;e who &s;piritually under&s;tand the my&s;tery of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> talk of living upon <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and being perfectly holy by <HI>faith only,</HI> without the&s;e things, they imagine we mean to re&s;t contented with &s;uch a faith as theirs; namely, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has died to ward off the wrath of God, to purcha&s;e his fa|vour, and as an effect of that to obtain certain inherent qua|lities and di&s;po&s;itions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to make us <HI>meet</HI> for the kingdom of heaven, was <HI>this</HI> our faith, it would be certainly requi&s;ite to &s;eek after <HI>this &s;ort</HI> of &s;anctification, and not be at re&s;t with|out we felt &s;omething of it. But on the contrary we believe, that the blood&s;hed upon the cro&s;s, was the <HI>very</HI> attonement, and that <HI>that</HI> blood has purged, put away, and blotted out all our &s;ins; and that then there was an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s brought in: by believing which, our hearts and con&s;ciences are made as perfectly clean, as tho' we had never &s;inned; in <HI>this</HI> con&s;i&s;ts true purity of &s;oul, and <HI>not</HI> in habitual qualities, and who&s;o are <HI>thus</HI> made pure and perfect, have fellow&s;hip with God, have the Holy Gho&s;t, have con&s;tant peace, and are deliver'd from the dominion of &s;in. They do al&s;o bear forth the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s, not in order to become <HI>more</HI> holy either in the &s;ight of God, or in their own con&s;ciences; but becau&s;e they <HI>are</HI> perfectly holy through faith, and <HI>a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, we have &s;till the vile &s;inful body, which conti|nually di&s;po&s;es the mind to evil, but the blood of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> by pu|rifying the con&s;cience, makes <HI>us free from &s;in,</HI> and as it were de&s;troys the connexion. I would therefore recommend this little piece to the con&s;ideration tho&s;e who de&s;ire to walk in the <HI>highway of holine&s;s;</HI> and remain theirs to &s;erve in the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI></P>

<HEAD>JUSTIFICATION BY <HI>CHRIST</HI> alone.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Unto him that hath loved us, and wa&s;hed away our &s;ins in his own blood,</Q>
<BIBL>Rev. i. 5.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THe&s;e words contain the virtue, fruit, and effec|tualne&s;s of Chri&s;t's death, and the benefit, pri|vilege, and happine&s;s of the &s;ons of God by it.</P>
<P>In the&s;e words we are to con&s;ider, 1. The per&s;ons who&s;e &s;ins Chri&s;t <HI>wa&s;hed away,</HI> and they were all tho&s;e who <HI>were given to Chri&s;t, John</HI> 17.29. 2. What is he that <HI>wa&s;hed their &s;ins away,</HI> and that is the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, ver. 5. 3. How, and by what means he wa&s;hed them away, and that was with his blood. It is a&s;cribed to his blood, becau&s;e, <HI>Without blood there is no remi&s;&s;ion, Heb.</HI> 9.22. <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> Did Chri&s;t's blood, as blood, &s;imply &s;o con&s;ider'd, effect this work? <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> No, there is &s;omething el&s;e included in it; as appears, <HI>The blood of Chri&s;t, who through the eternal Spirit, offer'd him&s;elf with|out &s;pot to God,</HI> Heb. 9.14. <HI>The word was God, the word took fle&s;h,</HI> John 1.14. Chri&s;t, who is God, by taking fle&s;h, united the elect by his fle&s;h to him&s;elf, and &s;o be|came one with God, as God and Chri&s;t are one, <HI>John</HI> 17.22, 23. So that the fle&s;h of Chri&s;t became (in an un|&s;peakable manner) one with the perfection of the divine and infinite being, which was the life and &s;ub&s;tance of all, which lay hid under, <HI>This vail, that is to &s;ay his fle&s;h,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
Heb. 10.20. So that by the power of his divine nature, he might make &s;atisfaction in and by the human; and by rea&s;on of this union, there was an infinite value and worth in Chri&s;t's blood; therefore it is called, <HI>The precious blood of Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.9. yea <HI>the blood of God,</HI> Acts 20.28. So that we may not <HI>know Chri&s;t</HI> &s;imply <HI>after the fle&s;h,</HI> but in the fle&s;h, and in the &s;pirit together, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.16. 4. The time when he wa&s;hed their &s;ins away, which was then when he &s;hed his blood: for in his blood they were wa&s;hed away, Chri&s;t's blood and their &s;ins went away to|gether. 5. The ground and cau&s;e why he took their &s;in away; was his love which was in him&s;elf, nothing in us, or done by us, could move him to die for us.</P>
<P>The &s;um of all is, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t by once offering the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf, when he was upon the cro&s;s, he took away, put to an end, blotted out, and utterly de&s;troyed all the &s;ins of his people for ever; and pre&s;ented them ju&s;t, righteous, and holy, without &s;pot before God.</P>
<P>This will appear to be true, if ye con&s;ider the&s;e &s;everal rea&s;ons, which are proved by plain &s;criptures.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e that was the time which Chri&s;t was to do this work in. <HI>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon the holy city, to fini&s;h the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and to make an end of &s;ins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, and to &s;eal up the vi&s;ion and prophecy, and to anoint the mo&s;t holy. And after three&s;core and two weeks &s;hall the Me&s;&s;iah be cut off, but not for him|&s;elf. And he &s;hall confirm the covenant with many. &amp;c.</HI> Dan. 9.24, 25, 26, 27. Which time was at an end when Chri&s;t died, therefore it is &s;aid, <HI>The year of my re|deemed is come,</HI> I&s;a. 63.4. Yea, <HI>the hour is come, &s;aith Chri&s;t,</HI> John 17.1.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e Chri&s;t was ordained of God to take away &s;ins, and to pre&s;ent us holy, <HI>Who verily was fore ordained to redeem us with his precious blood,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.19, 20. <HI>For he hath made him to be &s;in for us that knew no &s;in, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.21. <HI>Who of God is made unto us wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctifica|tion, and redemption,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.30.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e Chri&s;t was mighty to &s;ave. Therefore he
<PB N="5" REF="5">
did do this work him&s;elf alone: <HI>Who is this that cometh from Edom with dy'd garments from Bozrah? that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatne&s;s of his &s;trength? I that &s;peak in righteou&s;ne&s;s, mighty to &s;ave. I have trodden the wine pre&s;s alone, and of the people there was none with me. I looked, and there was none to help, therefore my own arm brought &s;alvation unto me,</HI> I&s;a. 63. So that Chri&s;t did all this work alone, for none el&s;e could help. Then <HI>thou &s;pake&s;t in a vi&s;ion to thy holy One, and &s;aid, I have laid help upon one that is mighty,</HI> P&s;al. 89.19.</P>
<P N="4">4. Becau&s;e Chri&s;t took fle&s;h on purpo&s;e to effect this work: <HI>Wherefore when he came into the world, he &s;aid, &s;acrifices and offerings thou would&s;t not, but a body thou ha&s;t prepar'd for me: in burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices for &s;in thou had&s;t no plea&s;ure,</HI> Heb. 10.</P>
<P N="5">5. It was the will of God that Chri&s;t &s;hould by the &s;hedding his blood, &s;anctify his, by <HI>the which will we are &s;anctified, through the offering of the body of Je&s;us once for all,</HI> Heb. 10. 5, to 11.</P>
<P N="6">6. Becau&s;e Je&s;us Chri&s;t came on purpo&s;e to take away our &s;ins. <HI>&amp;c. Then, &s;aid I, lo, I come to do thy will, O God,</HI> Heb. 10. <HI>He was manife&s;ted to take away our &s;ins, and in him is no &s;in,</HI> 1 John 3.5. <HI>Once in the end of the world hath he appeared to take away &s;in by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf,</HI> Heb. 9.12, 25, 26, 28.</P>
<P N="7">7. Becau&s;e Je&s;us Chri&s;t was made a <HI>cur&s;e</HI> for <HI>us,</HI> and &s;uffer'd all the puni&s;hment due to us for &s;in: <HI>Chri&s;t has redeemed us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us,</HI> Gal. 3.13. <HI>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our &s;orrows: we did e&s;teem him &s;tricken, and &s;mitten of God, and afflicted. He was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, he was brui&s;ed for our iniquities; the cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace was upon him: the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He bare the &s;ins of many, and made interce&s;&s;ion for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors,</HI> I&s;a. 53.</P>
<P N="8">8. Becau&s;e the &s;criptures &s;aith he hath obtained eternal redemption for us: <HI>Having obtained eternal redemption for us,</HI> Heb. 9. <HI>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins</HI>&punc; Col. 1.7. Col. 1.14. <HI>Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the &s;ins of the world.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
John 1.29. And that he hath healed us, <HI>By who&s;e &s;tripes we are healed,</HI> I&s;a. 53. <HI>Who his own &s;elf bare our &s;ins in his own body, by who&s;e &s;tripes we are healed,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.24.</P>
<P N="9">9. Becau&s;e it was the promi&s;e of God, that this work &s;hould pro&s;per, and that he &s;hould ju&s;tify many, by bearing their &s;ins: <HI>When thou &s;halt make his &s;oul an offering for &s;in, the plea&s;ure of the Lord &s;hall pro&s;per in his hand. I have put my &s;pirit upon him, he &s;hall bring forth judgment to the Gen|tiles. He &s;hall not fail, nor be di&s;couraged, till he hath &s;et iudgment on the earth,</HI> I&s;a. 42.1, 4, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 55.11. <HI>My righteous &s;ervant &s;hall ju&s;tify many: for he &s;hall bear their iniquity,</HI> I&s;a. 53.11. Were the&s;e promi&s;es fulfilled con|cerning Chri&s;t, or no? Surely yea. Then he hath ju&s;ti|fied his.</P>
<P N="10">10. Becau&s;e el&s;e Chri&s;t had not an&s;wer'd the types un|der the law.</P>
<P><HI>Adam</HI> was a type of Chri&s;t, who was a publick per&s;on as Chri&s;t was, and as truly the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> by one act, made all that were in him &s;inners, which was true enough; &s;o really and truly did Chri&s;t, the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> by his own act, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf, he made all that were in him righteous, and that is as true, &s;ee <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12, to 19, and <HI>as by one man's di&s;obedience many were made &s;inners, &s;o by the obedience of One many are made righteous</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And as by our natural birth we become per&s;onally &s;in|ners from our &s;inful root <HI>Adam;</HI> &s;o by our &s;piritual birth, or believing, we become per&s;onally righteous in our <HI>righteous branch Chri&s;t.</HI> &mdash; And as being conceived in &s;in, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we bear forth &s;inful fruit in thought, word, and actions; &s;o by being per&s;onally righteous <HI>in con&s;cience, by faith,</HI> we bear forth good fruit in thought, word, and actions.</NOTE>. As by the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> condemnation came, &s;o by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one came upon all unto ju&s;tification of life. The prie&s;t was a type of Chri&s;t, who is &s;aid to <HI>make attonement for you, to clean&s;e you from all your &s;ins before the Lord,</HI> Levit. 16.30. Chri&s;t by his death did pre&s;ent all his <HI>people to God without &s;pot, or blemi&s;h, or wrinkle,</HI> Ephe&s;. 5.25, 26, 27. <HI>In the body of his fle&s;h through death, to pre&s;ent you holy, and unreproveable in his &s;ight,</HI> Col. 1.22. So then I hope they are free from all &s;in, if the &s;cripture &s;aith truth, as it doth.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7">The live goat was a type of Chri&s;t, upon who&s;e <HI>head all the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the children were laid, who did bear them, and carry them all away into a land not inhabited in the wilderne&s;s,</HI> Levit. 16.21, 22. <HI>Which were &s;hadows of things to come, but the body is Chri&s;t,</HI> Col. 2.17.</P>
<P N="11">11. Becau&s;e Chri&s;t did exceed all the prie&s;ts and &s;acri|fices under the law; for <HI>they could not make the comers thereunto perfect:</HI> But Chri&s;t, the &s;ub&s;tance of tho&s;e &s;a|crifices, hath made his perfect. If tho&s;e &s;acrifices could have purged them, as Chri&s;t hath purged us, they &s;hould have <HI>no more con&s;cience of &s;in</HI> than we have, that is, none at all: becau&s;e we are for <HI>ever</HI> fully and freely &s;et free, being <HI>perfected:</HI> Heb. 10.10, 11, 12, 14. The prie&s;t <HI>under the law</HI> made many offerings, and yet by all their offer|ings they could never take away one &s;in: but Chri&s;t by one offering hath taken away all their &s;ins for ever; they &s;tood daily mini&s;tring, and offering oftentimes the &s;ame &s;acrifice, which could never take away &s;in, but this man after he had offered one &s;acrifice, for ever &s;at down at the right hand of God. <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.9, to 15. Oh what a difference is there betwixt them! Chri&s;t hath wonderfully exceeded them; therefore this prie&s;t, this offering is more glorious and happy; yea, and all the elect are made happy by this perfect, effectual, glorious offering. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.</P>
<P N="12">12. Becau&s;e there needs no more offerings for &s;in: therefore &s;in is quite gone, and remitted. <HI>Now where remi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e is, there is no more offering for &s;in,</HI> Heb. 10.17, 18. becau&s;e there needs none. For this one of Chri&s;t is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P N="13">13. Becau&s;e there can be no more required to be done to make us ju&s;t and righteous, than Chri&s;t hath done for us: he hath done all that he was required to do to take away &s;in, therefore he hath done. <HI>Je&s;us knowing that all things were accompli&s;hed, that the &s;criptures might be ful|filled.</HI> John 19.28, 30. 2 Cor. 5.21.</P>
<P N="14">14. Becau&s;e if Chri&s;t had not fully accompli&s;hed what he came to do, <HI>viz.</HI> to make us ju&s;t and righteous, he would not have <HI>a&s;cended into heaven</HI> as he did: <HI>This man after he had offered one &s;acrifice, &s;ate down at the right hand of God.</HI> Heb. 9. and 10.12.</P>
<P N="15"><PB N="8" REF="8">15.

For this end <HI>Chri&s;t gave him|&s;elf for his church, that he might pre&s;ent it to him&s;elf a glo|rious church, not having &s;pot or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing, but that it might be holy without blemi&s;h,</HI> Ephe&s;. 5. There|fore the &s;criptures &s;ay, all our &s;ins are <HI>&s;cattered, removed, ca&s;t behind his back: Thou ha&s;t ca&s;t all my &s;ins behind thy back.</HI> I&s;a. 38.7. <HI>They are ca&s;t into the depth of the &s;ea.</HI> Mich. 7.19. <HI>As far as the ea&s;t is from the we&s;t, &s;o far hath he removed our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions from us.</HI> P&s;al. 103.12.

Yet the &s;oul is not &s;a|tisfied, becau&s;e a thing may have a being that is covered; therefore God &s;aith they are blotted out, <HI>I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and as a cloud thy &s;in.</HI> I&s;a. 44.22. This is more, for now they are not, they have no being. But God can remember that which is not: this is an&s;wered, for God &s;aith, <HI>I wiil not remem|ber thy &s;ins.</HI> I&s;a. 43.25. <HI>I will remember their &s;ins no more.</HI> Jer. 31.34. I hope now you are &s;atisfied.</P>
<P N="16">16. Becau&s;e they are holy, and without &s;pot.

<P N="17">17. Becau&s;e Chri&s;t &s;aith that we are without &s;in; we <HI>may have boldne&s;s in the day of judgment, becau&s;e as he is, &s;o are we in this world.</HI> 1 Joh. 4.17.

Thus we are now, as we are in Chri&s;t in re&s;pect of his righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is ours though it be in him; I &s;ay, this our per|fection
<PB N="9" REF="9">
and happine&s;s is in re&s;pect of our ju&s;tification, and as we are in Chri&s;t: for as we are in our&s;elves &s;imply &s;o con&s;idered (though we were never out of Chri&s;t) in our bodies, in the fle&s;h, we are not capable of &s;o great perfection in this Life; for the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>If any man &s;aith he hath no &s;in, he is a lyar, and deceives him&s;elf.</HI> 1 John 1.8, 9. But the&s;e Scriptures are all true: there|fore we are all <HI>fair,</HI> without <HI>fault</HI> and <HI>&s;pot,</HI> and we are &s;o as we are in Chri&s;t, and &s;o we were made all this by Chri&s;t when he died.

Is not he that is no &s;inner a righteous per&s;on? mu&s;t not he that is free from all &s;in, of nece&s;&s;ity appear ju&s;t to him that knows he is &s;o? as God doth: it is all one to be free from &s;in, and to be perfectly righteous. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21. 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.7. there is no medium betwixt them: <HI>By his know|ledge &s;hall my righteous &s;ervant ju&s;tify many: for he &s;hall bear their iniquities.</HI> So that his bearing their iniquity was that which did ju&s;tify them; and by his knowledge he knew who&s;e &s;ins he bore, <HI>viz.</HI> whom he ju&s;tified. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 53.11.</P>
<P N="19">19. Chri&s;t upon the cro&s;s did this work for us, be|cau&s;e the &s;cripture &s;aith, <HI>He hath wa&s;hed away our &s;ins in his own blood.</HI> Rev. 5.1. therefore they are done away.

Je&s;us knowing that all things were now accompli&s;hed (that the &s;cripture might be fulfilled) &s;aith, I thir&s;t.

The work God gave Chri&s;t to do was the work of our &s;alvation, which con&s;i&s;ted in taking and de&s;troying our &s;ins, and pre&s;enting us holy, without &s;pot to God; and this he did by being <HI>made &s;in us, that &s;o we might be made</HI> (being made &s;in for us) <HI>the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him.</HI> 2 Cor. 5.21.</P>
<P>Therefore if when Chri&s;t died that was the time this was to be done, and if Chri&s;t was ordained to do it, if Chri&s;t was mighty to &s;ave, if Chri&s;t took fle&s;h to do this work, if it was the will of God that he &s;hould do it, if Chri&s;t came on purpo&s;e to do it, if our &s;ins were laid upon Chri&s;t, and he &s;uffered the puni&s;hment the cur&s;e of them, if he hath redeemed us; if it was prophe&s;ied of him that he &s;hould ju&s;tify many, and that his work &s;hould pro&s;per; if Chri&s;t did an&s;wer his types, if he hath ex|ceeded all the prie&s;ts and &s;acrifices under the law, if there needs no more offerings for &s;in, if Chri&s;t hath done all the law required, if Chri&s;t hath done what he came to do, if we are ju&s;tified by his blood, if he hath made us holy, and pre&s;ented us without &s;pot, if we are free from all &s;in, if Chri&s;t hath done all that can be done to make us ju&s;t and righteous, if Chri&s;t did wa&s;h away our &s;ins in his own blood, if Chri&s;t hath &s;aid, It is fini&s;hed; then it's done, it's done, it's done! perfectly and com|pleatly done: and then what I have &s;aid is fully proved, namely, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t by once offering the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf, when he was on the cro&s;s, put an end to &s;in, and &s;o de&s;troyed all the &s;ins of his people for ever, and pre&s;ented them ju&s;t, righteous, and holy, without &s;pot,

<P><HI>Many having a notion in this day of being ju&s;tified by a faith which is &s;ometime out of exerci&s;e.
