<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Letters were not unfavourably received at their fir&s;t appearance; but the operation of &s;uch tran&s;ient publi|cations is &s;oon worn out; I venture, there|fore, to lay them once more before the public. They were written whil&s;t &s;ome of the mea&s;ures which have brought on our pre&s;ent unexampled calamities were in agitation. The&s;e effects were then fore|&s;een in their cau&s;es. It may be worth while to take a review of both. Perhaps a further con&s;ideration of the inevitable con|nection between &s;uch cau&s;es and &s;uch ef|fects, may have a tendency at length to open, late as it is, the eyes of &s;ome well|meaning, but mi&s;taken &s;upporters of that unfortunate &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="6" MS="y">
The great bu&s;ine&s;s of this time is the bu&s;ine&s;s of us all; mini&s;ters allow not only our concern in the que&s;tion, but our com|petency to judge of it. By courting our favour, they have confe&s;&s;ed our importance. Never was the public approbation of offi|cial mea&s;ures &s;olicited with &s;uch an impor|tunate a&s;&s;iduity. Not &s;atisfied with the labours of the pre&s;s, the pulpit is taken into the &s;ervice. We &s;ee the &s;pirit of pride, ambition, and de&s;poti&s;m domineering in the &s;anctuary of humility, long-&s;uffering, and &s;elf-denial. War and blood come recom|mended from the oracles of peace and for|givene&s;s. As our mini&s;try equally employ the regular and the &s;avage to fight their battles, &s;o they u&s;e indi&s;criminately the or|thodox divine, and the field preacher, to animate the unthinking multitude to their new We&s;tern cru&s;ade&mdash;a cru&s;ade far more wild than any of tho&s;e fanatick expeditions, which in the gloom of ob&s;cure ages, were preached by mona&s;tick enthu&s;ia&s;m to Go|thick ignorance&mdash;a cru&s;ade more adver&s;e to the ju&s;t rights, and far more repugnant to all the hone&s;t feelings of human nature.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="7" MS="y">
The&s;e in&s;truments of mi&s;chief, of all &s;orts and colours, have been employed not only to &s;timulate our wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, but by a perver&s;ion of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions to increa&s;e their natural blackne&s;s and malignity. We are taught cruelty and arrogance towards our countrymen, meanne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to foreign nations. In this glorious work they are all employed, from the rich con|tractor, who con&s;umes the public revenue, down to the poor exci&s;eman who collects it. The influence of the crown, con&s;ider|able in peace, in war is boundle&s;s. There is hardly any denomination of men who do not find &s;ome immediate advantage in war; all this advantage is dealt out by mini&s;try, and is dealt out not as it may be&s;t &s;erve the purpo&s;es of their war, but of their faction. The expence of every military corps they rai&s;e, is the means of retaining a large body of venal, and therefore mo&s;t zealous, ad|vocates in their cau&s;e. Their grand aim in all this circulation, is to per&s;uade us that our &s;ufferings are the re&s;ult of our own de&s;ires, and not of their mi&s;managements.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="8">
Availing them&s;elves of the hired loqua|city of their agents, they a&s;&s;ert, that the voice of the people is with them. Thus every Engli&s;hman &s;eems called upon to admit or deny the fact, to confe&s;s or di&s;|claim his being a party to the public ruin. How exten&s;ively this delu&s;ion and corrup|tion may operate, I cannot determine; I tru&s;t that they have not yet prevailed over the major part of the kingdom. There are &s;till <HI>ears</HI> not ab&s;olutely clo&s;ed to all en|quiry into our real &s;ituation, and the merits of that conduct which has plunged us into it. We are &s;till in temper enough to exa|mine, whether the policy which has alie|nated three millions of people, has been well calculated to conciliate the affections of men? whether the mea&s;ures that have lo&s;t an empire, have been well adapted to enforce univer&s;al obedience?</P>
<P>The following letters agitate the&s;e que&s;|tions. It &s;eems to me to be a &s;ubject that cannot appear too often, or in too great a variety of &s;hapes before the public tribunal. Engli&s;h good &s;en&s;e may be mi&s;led from pa&s;&s;ion, it may be &s;urpri&s;ed from inatten|tion;
<PB N="v" REF="9" MS="y">
but I hope this nation is not yet ca|pable of deliberate non&s;en&s;e, and cool ab|&s;urdity.</P>
<P>The weak and violent mea&s;ures that have been adopted, have, as we fore&s;aw and foretold, induced all the Engli&s;h of Ame|rica to ca&s;t off entirely the government of this country. The mini&s;ters have declar|ed that it was always the intention of America to do &s;o; and they have certainly taken care that they &s;hould want no &s;ort of provocation to ju&s;tify the carrying that intention into act. They have called for <Q REND="inline">"<HI>unconditioned &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,</HI>"</Q> and they have been an&s;wered by <Q REND="inline">"<HI>total independence.</HI>"</Q> How far good management may remedy the effects of bad, it is impo&s;&s;ible to di|vine; but by a war to force unconditioned &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, no good can re&s;ult to the Eng|li&s;h nation on either &s;ide of the water.</P>
<P>Whatever we may think of it, this war will decide on our own liberties, as well as on tho&s;e of America.</P>
<P>If America be reduced to &s;lavery by force of arms, the freedom of the conqueror will not long &s;urvive the liberty of the van|qui&s;hed.
<PB N="vi" REF="10" MS="y">
It is not &s;afe for a &s;tate which values it&s;elf upon its privileges, to contain within it&s;elf a large body of people, who have no privileges of their own to lo&s;e. They will always act with that politician who aims at introducing a &s;cheme of <HI>equa|lity.</HI> This equality will be much more ea&s;ily compa&s;&s;ed, as it will be much more natu|rally de&s;ired by the undertaker, by pulling down tho&s;e above the level, than by rai&s;ing tho&s;e who are below it. When a Prince &s;hall come, who wi&s;hes to have his &s;ubjects &s;laves, he will mo&s;t certainly have all the &s;laves in his dominions of his Party. When the Roman empire was turned into a monarchy, the &s;ubject provinces which had been &s;tripped of all their rights by the pride of Rome, were unanimou&s;ly de&s;irous of a Revolution, which &s;unk all di&s;tinction in a common &s;ervitude, <HI>nec earum rerum &s;tatum, provinciae abnuerant, &s;u&s;pecto &s;enatus populique imperio.</HI></P>
<P>The mini&s;terial writers and addre&s;&s;ers have indeed lately hit upon a curious topic of declamation, which has furni&s;hed abun|dant matter of invective again&s;t their op|ponents, and of compliment (as they pre|tend)
<PB N="vii" REF="11">
to the King. The King (&s;ay the&s;e gentlemen) with an unparalleled magna|nimity of &s;pirit, and an unequalled regard for the con&s;titution,
<Q><L>"Above all Greek, above all Roman fame,"</L></Q>
Refu&s;es the a&s;toni&s;hing offer which the Colo|nies make him of becoming an ab&s;olute mo|narch, free from the controul of Parliament, over that exten&s;ive and growing part of the empire. According to the&s;e writers their very natural conte&s;t is thus circum&s;tanced: We behold a Prince exhau&s;ting his Exchequer, &s;pilling the blood of his be&s;t troops, and by his requi&s;itions, fatiguing every ally he can purcha&s;e&mdash;and all, to prevent an un|heard of &s;ort of rape from his own &s;ub|jects, who would compel him again&s;t his will, to accept an arbitrary authority over them. In this repre&s;entation we &s;ee all the &s;ubjects in one part of his dominions united with a very large portion of them in another part, by every method of violence, of faction, of &s;edition, and of open rebel|lion, &s;truggling to inve&s;t him with a bound|le&s;s dominion over their lives, liberties,
<PB N="viii" REF="12">
and fortunes! This is what the mini&s;|ters are not a&s;hamed to a&s;&s;ert&mdash;and they have even been at the fooli&s;h pains and ex|pence of circulating pamphlets to prove it.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation on the &s;ide of the &s;ubject is certainly new! the di&s;tre&s;s on the part of the Prince truly affecting!&mdash;It is by &s;ome &s;uch mi&s;repre&s;entation, undoubtedly, that the mini&s;ters delude and betray their Sovereign. This con&s;ideration entirely takes off all <HI>real</HI> blame from the &s;acred per&s;on to whom no blame can be imputed <HI>con&s;titutionally.</HI> But whatever &s;ucce&s;s they may meet in their deception, I am afraid that the gentlemen concerned in making this repre&s;entation, are them&s;elves perfectly well appri&s;ed of its fallacy. They will one day tell the King what Lord Sandwich publicly told the Duke of Grafton, that they deceived him on purpo&s;e to lead him on in their mea&s;ures. For they mu&s;t be tolerably &s;en&s;ible how ridiculous it is to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Americans, whom they are &s;o violently accu&s;ing of republicani&s;m, &s;hould be &s;hedding their be&s;t blood to e&s;ta|bli&s;h an ab&s;olute monarchy. That they,
<PB N="ix" REF="13">
who are charged with having always affected an entire independence of this crown, mean to give the King an unqualified authority over them, is &s;urely rather a little paradoxi|cal.</P>
<P>The reality of the fears of our Mini&s;ters, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"lea&s;t the King &s;hould obtain a revenue independent of Parliament,"</Q> appears from their continual complaint that the Colony a&s;&s;emblies make &s;o very poor and precarious a provi&s;ion for civil Govern|ment. It is in truth the frugality of the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, which the Mini&s;ters hate, and not their prodigality, that they &s;tand in dread of. They find it much more <HI>con&s;titu|tional</HI> to deal with one compliant, than with twenty refractory a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>They are in the right, it is a cour&s;e in|finitely more plea&s;ant to tho&s;e who govern. Parliament will, they know, be &s;ufficiently liberal of money which is not theirs, &s;ince they find them &s;o very moderate in its oeconomy of what is properly their own.</P>
<P>This &s;erious mini&s;terial dread of the King's enjoying a va&s;t revenue independent of Par|liament,
<PB N="x" REF="14" MS="y">
appears al&s;o by their perfect com|po&s;ure in a danger of the &s;ame kind, but far more pre&s;&s;ing, by being &s;o much nearer home. Ireland has a pen&s;ion li&s;t of 90,000l. a year, intirely at his Maje&s;ty's di&s;po&s;al; there are al&s;o offices there, intirely in his gift, to as large an amount; be&s;ides the exten&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition of near a million of revenue wholly out of the in&s;pection of the Briti&s;h Parliament.</P>
<P>It is &s;urpri&s;ing with what compo&s;ure the mini&s;terial magnanimity enables them to &s;leep with &s;uch a mine of power and influence under their pillow, and without the lea&s;t controul. This revenue is already much larger than the mo&s;t &s;anguine &s;pecu|lation could promi&s;e from American a&s;&s;em|blies in an hundred years.</P>
<P>But the truth is this; leaving to the Americans the di&s;po&s;ition of their own property can an&s;wer no mini&s;terial pur|po&s;es whatever, whether the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies make a more liberal, or a more re&s;erved u&s;e of this power. For if the American a&s;&s;emblies &s;hould continue in their origi|nal
<PB N="xi" REF="15">
uncivilized, churli&s;h, &s;avage purity, they will certainly grant no more of the &s;ub&s;tance of their con&s;tituents, than they are &s;ure will be for the advantage of tho&s;e who tru&s;t them with the di&s;po&s;al of it. In this ca&s;e, there will be no additional pen|&s;ions from America for Mr. Jenkin&s;on, Lord Clare, or Mr. Ellis, and a long et caetera of Parliamentary and mini&s;terial worthies. This is a &s;erious lo&s;s, and a real &s;ubject of alarm to Mini&s;ters ruling on the principles that now actuate our pub|lic councils.</P>
<P>If on the contrary, the Crown &s;hould, by degrees, and by good management ob|tain an influence which might excite the American a&s;&s;emblies to greater genero&s;ity, the effect would be too remote, for the pre|&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of power and favour to hope any &s;ort of advantage from it. Corruption is not very long &s;ighted. Selfi&s;hne&s;s does not con&s;ult &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The intere&s;ted of to|day, will not provide at their own expence for the profit of the &s;elf intere&s;ted of future times. Such po&s;terity, they know, have
<PB N="xii" REF="16">
a comfortable inheritance in their own care of them&s;elves; and the pre&s;ent generation will not fore&s;tall their indu&s;try. Be&s;ides the mi|ni&s;ters may be rather apprehen&s;ive, con&s;ider|ing the growing number of the American Repre&s;entatives, that the labourers may de|vour the whole harve&s;t, and leave little or no rent to be returned to the lawful Lords Paramount of Sine-cure and pen&s;ion, in Great Britain.</P>
<P>The&s;e I imagine are the real apprehen|&s;ions which ari&s;e from the idea of permit|ting the Americans to continue in the old practice of granting their own money; &s;ince this is the &s;ingle in&s;tance in which we find our politicians under &s;uch panic and &s;uper&s;titious fears of the effect of Crown influence. In all other re&s;pects, they are true free thinkers; genuine, unaffected e&s;|prits forts.</P>
<P>Whatever their fears or hopes may be, they have got us into a war, for the charges of which in any event, their gain or their lo&s;s, the good or the ill &s;ucce&s;s of their arms, will afford to poor England a very poor indemnity.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="17">
The mini&s;ters have indeed gone &s;uch lengths, that they think it impo&s;&s;ible for us to look back. They &s;ay that we mu&s;t now, without reflecting on the pa&s;t, en|deavour to give all manner of effect to the mea&s;ures that are on <HI>trial.</HI> If any thing rational were on trial, it would indeed be wrong not to let it have a fair one; but the execution of an ill-concerted plan, is the very mi&s;chief of it; it turns &s;peculative ab&s;urdity into practical; and beginning in ridicule, ends in mi&s;ery. Every day that we po&s;tpone our remedy, it undoubtedly grows the more difficult; and the terms of peace will become le&s;s honourable.</P>
<P>But ill as our condition is, &s;omething yet remains to be done. We have lo&s;t autho|rity by injudiciou&s;ly attempting to ob|tain a great enlargement of it. We may try whether it may not &s;till be po&s;&s;ible to recover &s;ome &s;ub&s;titute, at lea&s;t in friend|&s;hip and mutual intere&s;t, for what we have lo&s;t in power. But a protracted war will de&s;troy even to the &s;eeds of future friend|&s;hip. I am &s;en&s;ible that much is expected
<PB N="xiv" REF="18" MS="y">
from the va&s;t army which German penury and Engli&s;h prodigality has enabled the mini&s;try to employ. They who think that &s;laughtering, burning, and plundering, are the means of reconciling the minds of the people to our government, have but very poor ideas of any government at all. Al|though the&s;e cruel injuries may compel &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they are not of power to can|cel memory. The effect of terror is not la&s;ting, but the impre&s;&s;ions of hate and re|&s;entment are deeply inlaid in the hearts of men. The day may come when the affec|tions of America will be looked for as &s;omething of value, and they are even now worth purcha&s;ing even though He&s;&s;e and Brun&s;wick were to be defrauded of the large&s;t part of the bloody glories they are to purcha&s;e by the &s;laughter of Engli&s;h|men&mdash;although fewer Engli&s;h &s;calps were to decorate the martial dwellings of the &s;avage allies of our humane mini&s;try.</P>

<SALUTE>Mr. MILLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE mini&s;terial writers, in one of tho&s;e pa|ragraphs with which they enrich the public papers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Public Adverti&s;er.</NOTE> are plea&s;ed, for the &s;pecial entertainment of the good people of England, to tell them a curious piece of news. This intelligence is the more valuable, becau&s;e according to Lord Bacon's ex|pre&s;&s;ion, it comes home to our own bu&s;ine&s;s and bo&s;oms.</P>
<P>The&s;e gentlemen kindly inform us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that in the annals of the world, there is not to be found &s;o extraordinary a nation as our's."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We place (it &s;eems,) our chief plea&s;ure in di&s;content, and by a retrograde propen&s;ity of thinking, are never <HI>compleatly happy,</HI> without being <HI>compleatly mi&s;erable.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="21">
The Mini&s;ters have made a valuable di&s;covery in the national character. It mu&s;t be admitted to their honour, that none have ever more perfectly profited of their knowledge of mankind, or have laboured more &s;ucce&s;sfully to give entire &s;atisfac|tion to their country. By continuing the &s;ame benevolent efforts a little longer, there is no doubt but that they will perfectly attain their end. The people of England are at length in a fair way of being compleatly happy, and happy in their own mode.</P>
<P>Ob&s;ervers have been for &s;ome time at a lo&s;s to account for the conduct of Mini&s;try. They were not able to enter into the cau&s;es of their &s;upine neglects and untimely endeavours. They could not penetrate into the motives for their violent de|nunciations, and their feeble efforts; for their di&s;inclination to peace, and their inability for war; for their irritating America to re&s;i&s;tance, by the au&s;terity of their laws; and encouraging that re|&s;i&s;tance, by the weakne&s;s of their military arange|ments. The whole is now explained. They were &s;eeking for popularity; they were conforming them&s;elves to our <HI>retrograde propen&s;ities;</HI> they were generou&s;ly labouring for the felicity of a nation, which, as they have &s;agaciou&s;ly di&s;covered, <Q REND="inline">"can never be compleatly happy, till they are rendered compleatly mi&s;erable."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="22">
The benevolence of the&s;e good men even extends to their wor&s;t enemies. They tell us in the &s;ame paragraph, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the modern Patriots &s;hudder at the probability of &s;ucce&s;s in the management of public affairs, and brood with a &s;avage de|light over the hopes of a national calamity."</Q></P>
<P>The modern Patriots are in truth as unrea&s;onable as they are repre&s;ented to be factious, if they do not gratefully acknowledge the incredible pains that Mini&s;try has taken to plea&s;e them. They have engaged us in a war, after &s;uch a Patriot's own heart. Envy and malignity would have be&s;poke it. In this war the object, the conduct, the probability of &s;ucce&s;s, are all exactly alike.</P>
<P>We are &s;truggling, it &s;eems, to obtain a revenue by force, which that very force mu&s;t for ever di&s;able the Colonies from yielding. At the &s;ame time we are incurring expences, that no wealth in the &s;ubjugated Provinces, and no chearfulne&s;s in granting it, can ever defray.</P>
<P>The &s;cene of the war is on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic ocean. There, we have no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, no alliance, not a &s;ingle friend. Thither we are to tran&s;port the flower of the Engli&s;h youth, con|&s;igned to &s;laughter, di&s;ea&s;e, and famine. Every thing nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of war, or to the &s;u&s;tenance of life, even to the minute&s;t articles of both, mu&s;t be conveyed to the Briti&s;h troops from hence, at the expence of millions, and at the
<PB N="4" REF="23">
mercy of winds and &s;eas. The &s;upply of great armies, even in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t plentiful countries, and in the mo&s;t commodious &s;ituations, is chargeable, difficult, and &s;ometimes precarious. What a work then mu&s;t the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of an army be, (I mean an army &s;ufficient to produce any effect,) in a country three thou&s;and miles di&s;tant from home? In a country where the provi&s;ion for a &s;ingle day cannot be purcha&s;ed? Every &s;ini&s;ter incident, every unfavourable event, mu&s;t be re|paired, if it can at all be repaired, from the di&s;tance of 70 degrees of longitude; and the lea&s;t delay or misfortune attending the &s;upply, puts an end to the operations of an whole campaign.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Mini&s;terial operations are clogged with the&s;e difficulties, the Americans are training and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The wonderful march of Arnold, in our Gazette, par excel|lence I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;tiled <HI>one</HI> Arnold, is &s;ome proof of the ju&s;tne&s;s of this rea&s;oning.</NOTE> hardening them&s;elves to war. The conti|nuance of the quarrel inures them to the &s;tate of things into which they are fallen. They are in the mid&s;t of their re&s;ources. With whatever vain hopes Mini&s;ters may flatter them&s;elves or attempt to delude their country, we may be a&s;|&s;ured, that where recruits, provi&s;ions, wood and iron, are furni&s;hed by the country, the re&s;t of the in&s;truments of war are ea&s;ily procured. No &s;ea|man will a&s;&s;ert, that powder cannot be conveyed
<PB N="5" REF="24">
to the Colonies from abroad. No naturali&s;t will affirm, that it cannot be made by them at home.</P>
<P>This is the true &s;tate of our affairs; this is the probability of &s;ucce&s;s, which it &s;eems is to glorify admini&s;tration, and to make patriots &s;hudder.</P>
<P><HI>Provided</HI> that no misfortune happens to the ar|my in America; <HI>provided</HI> no foreign power inter|feres to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Provincials; <HI>provided</HI> that the foreign powers in whom we tru&s;t will certainly a&s;&s;i&s;t us:&mdash;With all the&s;e provi&s;os, it is po&s;&s;ible, that this nation may, for one &s;ea&s;on more,&mdash;ju&s;t one more,&mdash;continue the expences of this de&s;pe|rate and ruinous conte&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mean time the mini&s;terial writers may manufacture paragraphs to amu&s;e the people of England; the Mini&s;ters may &s;end out more por|ter to keep up the &s;pirits of the di&s;heartened troops at Bo&s;ton; the yet remaining wealth of England may be &s;quandered in various ways, for the pur|po&s;e of hiding under lucrative contracts for war, the ha&s;ty declen&s;ion of trade; they may buy, or beg, or cheat corporations into flattering addre&s;&s;es. All the&s;e are but poor and temporary devices, which may for a while veil from our eyes the real &s;tate of our affairs, but are not of power to avert or &s;often the &s;malle&s;t part of the impending cala|mity. In&s;en&s;ibility of danger, and &s;ecurity from it, are very different things.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="25">
The African trade has felt the blow already. The We&s;t-India trade &s;taggers, and is doomed to fall the next. No trade can long &s;tand the pre&s;ent unwi&s;e conte&s;t. The lo&s;s of the Ameri|can commerce is a la&s;ting evil; the &s;ub&s;titute for it, in the flu&s;h which the Ru&s;&s;ian peace and the Spani&s;h armament have cau&s;ed, is contingent, ca&s;ual, inadequate.</P>
<P>The mini&s;terial Manife&s;to, from which I have quoted the above extraordinary pa&s;&s;ages, &s;peaks of it as of a circum&s;tance of a&s;toni&s;hing ab&s;urdity, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that an Engli&s;hman &s;hould look upon the TRIUMPH of the King's troops with regret."</Q> Engli&s;hmen will tell Mini&s;ters what they think of &s;uch a triumph, when they have the fortune to &s;ee it. As yet that triumph has not been cau&s;e of joy or &s;orrow to any man alive.</P>
<P>Do the&s;e men mock at our di&s;tre&s;s? Do they really think that the precipitous retreat of the King's troops from Lexington, was a triumph? Do they think that the action at Bunker's-hill, where at the expence of more than half the num|ber that fought, the&s;e troops purcha&s;ed a &s;mall enlargement of their burial ground, was a tri|umph? Do they imagine that it is a triumph of the&s;e poor half-&s;tarved troops, to have &s;uffered from the day of that action, as indeed they had
<PB N="7" REF="26" MS="y">
long before, as clo&s;e a blockade as any garri&s;on can &s;uffer in a place that is open to the &s;ea?</P>
<P>If the&s;e be the triumphs of the King's forces, every public &s;pirited, every humane and hone&s;t mind, beholds them with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow and regret. There is no man worthy of bearing the name of Engli&s;hman, who does not &s;ee with grief the mi&s;erable and di&s;graceful &s;ituation of the brave&s;t troops, and the be&s;t commanders in the world. That man mu&s;t be very indifferent to the glory of his country, who does not &s;ee and feel too, for the condition into which both have been brought, by the mo&s;t unexampled imbecility and ra&s;hne&s;s; a condition which originating from plans laid in gro&s;s mi&s;information and fundamental error, no courage in the troops, and no &s;kill in the commanders, can po&s;&s;ibly improve.</P>
<P>Here, for the pre&s;ent, I am obliged to leave the troops and the <HI>triumph.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ticonderoga, Chambli, St. John's, Montreal, may be added to the li&s;t of the&s;e triumphs.</NOTE> I now turn to the gentle|men who fight, under much more comfortable cir|cum&s;tances, the battles of the Mini&s;try in England. It is not only in the paragraph I quote, that they pre&s;ume to in&s;ult tho&s;e who differ from them in politics, by charging them with a delight in the national calamities.

<P>There are &s;ome indeed, who, if they do not delight in the national di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;eem at lea&s;t not to entertain a proper horror of them.

<HEAD>ADDRESSES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday, September 30.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Mr. MILLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE manner in which admini&s;tration is em|ployed, appears rather extraordinary in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the nation. That pe|riod, once &s;o awful; that day of account, once &s;o terrible to &s;tate&s;men, the <HI>meeting of Parliament,</HI> is at hand. It might be imagined, that at &s;uch a time, Mini&s;try were exceedingly bu&s;y in fabri|cating, for the &s;atisfaction of the two Hou&s;es, what they have hitherto thought proper to with|hold from the public,&mdash;&s;ome &s;ort of apology for the total failure of all their projects.</P>
<P>It might be &s;uppo&s;ed they were continually oc|cupied in a careful and detailed review of their former mea&s;ures; that by &s;uch a review they might di&s;cover to what mi&s;take in the plan, or to what weakne&s;s in the execution, we were to a&s;cribe the pre&s;ent calamitous &s;ituation of our
<PB N="10" REF="29">
affairs. One would think they were, at length, bending their attention on &s;ome &s;cheme for preventing, if po&s;&s;ible, the final di&s;member|ment of the empire. In&s;tead of this, they are wholly occupied in <HI>the manufacture of addre&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>To common ob&s;ervers this &s;eems to be an odd entertainment for men in their condition. If in|deed addre&s;&s;es to Mini&s;ters could in&s;ure victories to armies; if railing at enemies could repair de|feats; if flattery could cover di&s;graces; if &s;ervi|lity could give plenty to famine, health to di&s;ea&s;es, and cure to wounds, nothing could be more pro|perly applied to the exigencies of Mini&s;ters, and to the nece&s;&s;ities of tho&s;e who have the misfor|tune to bear arms in their &s;upport. If addre&s;&s;es had this virtue, the&s;e courtly performances would certainly merit all the care and expence which has been &s;o profu&s;ely lavi&s;hed in obtaining them.</P>
<P>Although I think this proceeding of Mini&s;try in many re&s;pects weak and trifling, yet I confe&s;s that nothing, <HI>no not an addre&s;s</HI> exi&s;ts in vain. The managers are able to perceive, among the fir&s;t ef|fects of this hopeful war (into which they have betrayed their country) an immen&s;e, an immediate increa&s;e of the public burthens. They &s;ee at length, and they &s;ee only, becau&s;e they are forced to feel, that they have drawn up the &s;luices of an expence, which will not be in their power to let down at plea&s;ure. They per&s;evere in their mea|&s;ures,
<PB N="11" REF="30">
becau&s;e they wi&s;h to continue in their places. They know that the mea&s;ures, ne|ce&s;&s;ary to their opulence, mu&s;t end in the beg|gary of their country. When the pur&s;e and pa|tience of the people are exhau&s;ted by the accu|mulated charges of an unnatural and di&s;graceful war, it is then that the pre&s;ent manoeuvres are to take their effect. The Mini&s;try will put the peo|ple in mind, that they &s;uffer at their own <HI>&s;pecial re|que&s;t.</HI> They will <HI>point to their addre&s;&s;es,</HI> and tell them <Q REND="inline">"TAXATION IS NO TYRANNY."</Q></P>
<P>In one part of their project, there is no doubt the Mini&s;try will &s;ucceed. They will get addre&s;&s;es enough. None have ever mi&s;&s;ed who have ever &s;ought them. All the little agitators in boroughs will ea&s;ily per&s;uade men of much vanity, and no reflection, that their names to an addre&s;s gives them a con&s;equence at Court. The little, cun|ning, bu&s;tling politicians, in a corporation, think they may with great &s;afety exert them&s;elves to oblige a particular friend, that knows who and who are together, and that, when he plea&s;es, may &s;ee tho&s;e who &s;ee the King. If things go well, they may plead merit; if ill, they are lo&s;t in the crowd, and protected by their ob&s;curity. One of the&s;e &s;nug Machiavels will rea&s;on thus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We are in for it. If the Mini&s;ter chu&s;es a war, he will go to war, whether we will or not. If the taxes go on, little places, and little jobs as
<PB N="12" REF="31">
well as great ones, will increa&s;e. We too, if we play our cards well, may come in for &s;nacks; whil&s;t the whole burthen of the war, without any alleviation, will fall on the grumblers."</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>little</HI> politician at the Town Hall is not al|together mi&s;taken. If his principal happens to think of him, after the purpo&s;e is &s;erved, he may be paid for his work; but the <HI>little politician</HI> at the Cockpit will find him&s;elf mi&s;erably deluded. When the national debt and national taxes begin to &s;well; when trade &s;inks under its oppre&s;&s;ions; when Europe begins to be involved; and the civil becomes but an introduction to a general war, the Mini&s;ter, whoever he is, will find that tho&s;e who are willing to flatter, are not able to protect him. Tho&s;e who are &s;o ready to advi&s;e him to plunge his country into a war, will not be in a capacity to furni&s;h him with the means of carrying on that war, nor with the expedient for extricating him|&s;elf out of it.</P>
<P>I believe there are very few of the&s;e &s;igners, or even of the original promoters of the&s;e addre&s;&s;es, who have once given them&s;elves the trouble to enquire, whether this war, of which they are &s;o enamoured, be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary? To a&s;k them&s;elves, how it is to be &s;upported? To con&s;i|der, what end it is to an&s;wer, if &s;ucce&s;sful? Or to reflect, if it be un&s;ucce&s;sful, what remedy is to be found in &s;o dreadful a di&s;a&s;ter?</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="32" MS="y">
One circum&s;tance methinks ought to make the&s;e gentlemen who halloo, or who are hallooed to war, a little cautious how they dip their hands in blood. The Mini&s;ters have &s;et out in their war with an avowed confe&s;&s;ion, <HI>that they are not able to carry it on with the &s;trength of this country.</HI> They are at this in&s;tant &s;uppliant at every Court in Europe. There is not a country in which want and &s;ervi|tude have turned the lives of the &s;ubject into an object of traffick to the Prince, in which Mini&s;try are not mortgaging the revenue of England, and plighting the faith of future Parliaments. It is to HANOVERIAN, to HESSIAN, to RUSSIAN Arms, that England is to owe the recovery, and the pre|&s;ervation of our authority in America.</P>
<P>Such arms are, I admit, the natural in&s;tru|ments for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of arbitrary power. But the addre&s;&s;ers of &s;uch mea&s;ures would do well to a&s;k them&s;elves, to whom that arbitrary power is to belong, if foreign force &s;hould prove &s;ucce&s;s|ful? To tho&s;e, by whom conque&s;ts are made, the benefits of conque&s;ts will belong. But I ab|hor the idea&mdash;Heaven forbid that &s;laves &s;hould ever become the ma&s;ters of freemen; or that Ru&s;&s;ian ferocity &s;hould triumph over Engli&s;h va|lour in any part of the world.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;try, though they are compleatly di&s;|graced in their principles, for the attempt to ter|minate
<PB N="14" REF="33">
Briti&s;h di&s;putes by foreign arms, may be further di&s;graced by their policy, by their failure in that enterpri&s;e. They have not yet been able to gratify their addre&s;&s;ers with any certain a&s;&s;urance that they &s;hall be permitted to tran&s;port over the Atlantic ocean 20,000 Calmucks and Co&s;&s;acks, to lay wa&s;te with fire and &s;word the habitations of Engli&s;hmen, and to turn one of the faire&s;t part of the Briti&s;h dominions into one of their Tarta|rian de&s;arts.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They have not yet been able to &s;ucceed with regard to Ru&s;&s;ia, but &s;ome German Princes have conde&s;cended to furni&s;h them with the means of ruining their country, by the mercenary aid of &s;everal regiments of He&s;&s;ians, Brun&s;wickers, Waldecks, and De&s;&s;aus.</NOTE></P>
<P>Whoever advi&s;es others to war, ought not only to be per&s;uaded that the war is ju&s;t, but he ought to have a rea&s;onable a&s;&s;urance, that tho&s;e to whom he applies him&s;elf, are of ability to carry it on with &s;ucce&s;s. Otherwi&s;e he is not only &s;acrificing the intere&s;t of his country, but he is di&s;gracing and ruining the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice it&s;elf. Of the abi|lity of the Mini&s;ters for this great ta&s;k, the ad|dre&s;&s;ers may have &s;ome private knowledge to which they tru&s;t. But I mu&s;t &s;ay their friends in power have not yet been plea&s;ed to favour the public, who&s;e approbation they court, with any means of doing their capacity the honour that
<PB N="15" REF="34">
perhaps it de&s;erves. Nothing has &s;ucceeded with them, either in their civil provi&s;ions, or in their military arrangements.</P>
<P>They have made a great number of acts of parliament, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bo&s;ton Port Act. Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Charter Act. Military Execution Act. Re&s;training fi&s;hery, (commonly called the Starvation) Act. The re&s;training intercour&s;e Act, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> which has left the &s;tate of govern|ment in a thou&s;and times a wor&s;e condition than they found it. They followed their acts of par|liament with above twenty of the be&s;t regiments in the &s;ervice; with almo&s;t the whole of the ma|rines; with &s;uch a &s;trength of artillery and artil|lery companies, as were never employed when we made war with France in America. To give ef|fect to this force, they have &s;ent no le&s;s than four Generals. To the great land force, they have added a great naval power. The re&s;ult of all the&s;e immen&s;e military arrangements has been, that the Mini&s;ters have <HI>one</HI> town in America&mdash;for their armies to &s;tarve and die in.&mdash;This is the faithful ab&s;tract of the fir&s;t year's hi&s;tory, of our <HI>new &s;ocial war.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are plain matters of fact. An hone&s;t man, who &s;ees no more than I can &s;ee of the probability of &s;ucce&s;s in the cour&s;e which has been hitherto pur&s;ued, would therefore have his &s;cruples about urging the &s;ame men to proceed in the &s;ame cour&s;e,
<PB N="16" REF="35">
which has been hitherto &s;o very unpro&s;perous. Have the&s;e flatterers any ground for confidence, that the future proceedings of Mini&s;ters will be more fortunate than the pa&s;t? If they have, it will be kind of them to open it a little to their expect|ing country. One circum&s;tance of incapacity in the&s;e Mini&s;ters is clear beyond all di&s;pute, they have known nothing of the difficulty of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s they were engaged in. As the difficulty was not known, it could not be provided for. In con&s;equence of this ignorance of the real &s;tate of America, all the force that has hitherto been &s;ent thither is lo&s;t. We have all to begin anew, as if nothing had been attempted. England, under their conduct, exhau&s;ted before &s;he has acted, is obliged to re&s;t all her hopes on the capricious al|liance of a de&s;potic Court, and the perilous a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of barbarian mercenary forces.</P>
<P>It is for this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and for the&s;e forces, that &s;ome deluded people are per&s;uaded to addre&s;s. Our misfortunes are aggravated by a morti&s;ying mixture of the ridiculous. We have been brought it &s;eems into this di&s;graceful &s;ituation of <HI>foreign dependance,</HI> in order to maintain the <HI>honour and dignity of Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this topic of our <HI>dignity,</HI> I may &s;ay &s;omething hereafter. For the pre&s;ent, I would &s;eriou&s;ly recommend it to my countrymen, to con|&s;ider
<PB N="17" REF="36">
(what never has been con&s;idered for them) the difficulties of their proceeding in the cour&s;e they have begun, and at the &s;ame time the facility which appears for getting out of them.</P>
<P>The way before us, if we pur&s;ue the pre&s;ent cour&s;e, grows every &s;tep more and more perplexed. The point at which we propo&s;e to re&s;t, recedes further and further from our view. The way, if we change our route, is &s;hort and &s;imple. The &s;ingle condition of peace propo&s;ed by America is, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>That we &s;hould put things on the footing they &s;tood in</HI> 1762."</Q> This is the propo&s;ition of the Con|gre&s;s; and this &s;urely is no har&s;h, cruel, or humi|liating injunction. We are de&s;ired to put our|&s;elves, and our colonies, into that &s;tate, in which, from our happy union, we were the envy of the world. But the fir&s;t terms propo&s;ed, are not the la&s;t conclu&s;ive ones; better may be obtained by <HI>treaty;</HI> all may be lo&s;t <HI>by violence.</HI></P>
<P>Have we then any rational ground of hope, that by an ob&s;tinate war un&s;kilfully carried on, we &s;hall be able to force from America more ad|vantageous terms of peace, than &s;he offers at this moment? Before any man &s;ets his hand to an ad|dre&s;s, he ought to have a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to the que&s;tion I have put. To abu&s;e America, and to talk of dignity, is not an an&s;wer.</P>

<HEAD>DIGNITY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday, October 7.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Mr. MILLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN this letter I intend to apply my&s;elf princi|pally to tho&s;e of my countrymen, who are commonly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the <HI>Tory Party.</HI></P>
<P>There are many things in the doctrine and practice of that body, which I never could per|fectly approve. A party who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic is a de&s;ire of exalting the pre|rogative of the Crown, ought never to take the lead in a government con&s;tituted like ours. But though I could not reli&s;h the doctrines of this po|litical &s;et, I did not of cour&s;e condemn the inten|tions of all who held them. I did not, I confe&s;s, think the Tory party entirely well affected to the con&s;titution. Their own favourite phra&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>The old con&s;titution,</HI>"</Q> which was, and is continually in
<PB N="19" REF="38">
their mouths, &s;eems to imply an invidious di&s;|tinction; and to intimate a di&s;like to the con&s;titu|tion, as perfected, or if they plea&s;e, new model|led at the Revolution. But whatever their opi|nions of the con&s;titution might be, I thought them zealous, according to their ideas, for the intere&s;t and honour of their country. In all things which di&s;tingui&s;h this i&s;land from any other nation, the exclu&s;ive and patriotic partiality of their affections has con&s;tantly broke out, and &s;ometimes not in the mo&s;t decent and orderly manner that could be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>It always appeared to me a circum&s;tance rather &s;ingular, that they who&s;e principles were &s;o much of foreign growth, &s;hould far out go the Whigs them&s;elves in the abhorrence of foreigners. The great ble&s;&s;ing derived from the Revolution, could not make them forget that King William was a Dutchman. They did not readily forgive even the founders of the fortune and greatne&s;s of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, that they were born in Ha|nover, and were &s;uppo&s;ed to entertain &s;entiments of partial regard to their native country.</P>
<P>In the principle of all this, though &s;ometimes car|ried too far, and &s;ometimes mi&s;applied, there was &s;omething re&s;pectable. I remember perfectly well, that when the He&s;&s;ian troops were brought hither in the la&s;t reign, this party complained very loudly.
<PB N="20" REF="39">
The imminent inva&s;ion of England at that time, did not reconcile them to the mea&s;ure of committing any part, even of our mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary defence, to fo|reign forces. Tho&s;e foreign troops who were brought over for the purpo&s;e of quieting <HI>the trou|bles in Scotland</HI> (for I mean to &s;peak gently) in the year 1745, did not meet from that party a more fa|vourable reception. Their unaffected dread of the prevalence of the Hou&s;e of Stuart in that criti|cal conte&s;t, could not make them permit a mo|mentary departure from their ancient maxims. Their pre&s;ervation from the greate&s;t of all cala|maties, a &s;ubjection to an irritated, a revengeful, a bigotted, even a foreign ma&s;ter, a ma&s;ter who founded his right upon the &s;uppo&s;ed nullity of every right in his &s;ubjects, could not excu&s;e this obnoxious mode of &s;afety.</P>
<P>It was in vain alledged in mitigation of that mea&s;ure, that the national troops were engaged abroad, that we had no time to get together, and to di&s;cipline a body of Engli&s;h; that our foreign enemies had interfered, that &s;ome forces in the French &s;ervice were actually in Scotland; and the arrival of more was daily apprehended. This was all urged to inattentive ears. The Tories &s;till ex|claimed, that the troops of our allies brought hi|ther on that occa&s;ion were <HI>foreigners;</HI> and no|thing but the con&s;ideration that a late capitulation
<PB N="21" REF="40" MS="y">
had bound them not to be of any u&s;e, could in|duce the Tory party to bear the pre&s;ence of &s;uch gue&s;ts, with any rea&s;onable patience.</P>
<P>Sudden emergencies may make the departure from the mo&s;t wi&s;e and &s;ettled principles ju&s;tifia|ble by the evident nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e. But cer|tainly, the general principle <HI>of keeping foreign powers from interfering in national di&s;putes,</HI> is founded in the true&s;t wi&s;dom, and &s;ounde&s;t po|licy. There is not only, no dignity, but no &s;afety in a different conduct. I was therefore a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed, when I found &s;o many of the Tories not only tolerating, but rejoicing in the attempts made by Mini&s;ters for engaging large bodies of foreigners to act in the <HI>pre&s;ent civil war.</HI> To what are we to attribute this extraor|dinary change, which that party has made in the only part of their &s;entiments, in which they were perfectly ju&s;tifiable? In&s;tead of murmurs, com|plaints, and remon&s;trances, we &s;ee the per&s;ons mo&s;t warm in that cau&s;e, almo&s;t every where ac|tive, and bu&s;tling to procure addre&s;&s;es of com|pliment, in order to give the Mini&s;ters all kind of credit and &s;upport in their negociations for <HI>fo|reign troops.</HI></P>
<P>In all this I &s;ee no &s;ort of attention to the ho|nour of this country. The fir&s;t principle of dig|nity is <HI>independence.</HI> A government in profound
<PB N="22" REF="41">
peace with all its neighbours, which is not able, without external a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to enforce obedience from its own &s;ubjects, is in effect annihilated. The powers on whom &s;uch a phantom of autho|rity depends, are the true and real government. The other is only a va&s;&s;al. If we cannot govern it but by the forces of Ru&s;&s;ia and Hanover, Hanover and Ru&s;&s;ia are not only the <HI>Rulers of America,</HI> but they are the <HI>Ma&s;ters of England.</HI></P>
<P>There mu&s;t be &s;ome extraordinary weakne&s;s in Admini&s;tration, &s;ome di&s;inclination to the &s;er|vice in the gro&s;s of the people, &s;omething unu|&s;ually colourable in the re&s;i&s;tance, that at the very <HI>out&s;et of the quarrel,</HI> has di&s;abled the &s;tronge&s;t power in the world. Our Mini&s;ters &s;tumble at the thre&s;hold; they are out of wind before they have run the fir&s;t heat. The fir&s;t year of this war in America, they implore foreign nations to bring them out of that &s;truggle, which, a little while ago, they told us might be ended by a very few of the &s;uperfluous regiments, which a <HI>prodi|gal peace e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> wantonly kept up for pa|rade and &s;hew&mdash;Such is the dignity of England in the hands of its pre&s;ent tru&s;tees!</P>
<P>If we cannot end our own quarrels by our own wi&s;dom, or our own power, they will never be ended. Foreigners very rarely, if ever, interfere
<PB N="23" REF="42">
with cordial purpo&s;es to the benefit of the party which calls them in. It will be their bu&s;ine&s;s, like lawyers, to prolong the &s;uit, in order to ex|hau&s;t the litigants.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the quarrel continues, foreign powers know that you mu&s;t comply with every demand, and &s;ubmit to every in&s;ult. The old enemies of the kingdom will be &s;ure to fan the flames of di&s;&s;ention. The very be&s;t affected of the foreign Courts will make them&s;elves nece&s;&s;ary as long as they can. They will a&s;&s;i&s;t you ju&s;t enough to <HI>continue</HI> the di&s;pute, but not to end it; becau&s;e that di&s;pute, and their &s;uperiority, mu&s;t have ex|actly the &s;ame duration.</P>
<P>Rather than con&s;ent to be thus at the mercy of foreigners, Dignity, if &s;he would conde&s;cend to take common-&s;en&s;e into her councils, would think, that the cruel alternative propo&s;ed by the American Congre&s;s, <Q REND="inline">"of returning to the &s;itua|tion in which we &s;tood in 1762,"</Q> ought to be ac|cepted. If Engli&s;h Dignity is to be compro|mi&s;ed, I had rather &s;ettle amicably with Ame|rica, than be obliged to too polite a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Hou&s;e of Bourbon. I &s;hould con&s;ent ra|ther to bear the Roughne&s;s of Engli&s;h Liberty, than &s;ubject my&s;elf to foreign Pride, and barba|rian In&s;olence. I had rather &s;hake Hancock and
<PB N="24" REF="43">
Adams by the hand, than cool my heels in the antichamber of Orloff and Potemkin.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I fear I ought to apologize for a &s;entiment &s;o oppo&s;ite to the notions adopted by the Mini&s;ter, and all his friends.

<HEAD>THE CAMPAIGN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday, October 11.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Mr. MILLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE proper an&s;wer to an addre&s;s for war, is a tax. There can be no doubt, but that &s;uch an an&s;wer will be returned fairly and &s;peedily, and without a &s;hadow of equivocation. In this point at lea&s;t, the Mini&s;ters are capable of giving perfect &s;atisfaction to their admirers. To <HI>exhau&s;t the &s;inking fund,</HI>&mdash;to <HI>accumulate debt,</HI>&mdash;to <HI>rai&s;e the land tax,</HI>&mdash;to put an <HI>additional duty on malt,</HI> and on <HI>malt liquors,</HI>&mdash;and <HI>to revive the home exci&s;e upon cyder,</HI>&mdash;the&s;e are things within the power of the mo&s;t common financier. The ways of taking the public money, or of &s;pend|ing it when taken, are tolerably obvious. There is nothing required for the&s;e purpo&s;es, but pa|tience on the part of the people. And Admini|&s;tration has had, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, comfort|able
<PB N="26" REF="45" MS="y">
a&s;&s;urances, that the good people of Eng|land po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;ufficient &s;hare of that &s;teady and u&s;eful, though not very &s;hining virtue.</P>
<P>The Addre&s;&s;ers, with an hone&s;t eagerne&s;s and anxiety, a&s;k for war, and they offer their for|tunes. They need be under no &s;ort of unea&s;i|ne&s;s. The one will be given, and the other will be taken; and as far as I can di&s;cover from the courtly language of the Gazette, this is what is de&s;ired, and all that is de&s;ired, in the many dutiful and loyal addre&s;&s;es with which that in&s;tructive paper has lately &s;welled &s;o much beyond its u&s;ual dimen&s;ions.</P>
<P>In former times, when the evil habits of fac|tion had rendered men importunate and difficult, a little more than this would have been looked for. People would have been de&s;irous of &s;ome account of the ends and purpo&s;es for which the public money had been expended; of the man|ner in which the war had been conducted; of the future pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s from the arrange|ments already made, or which were in apparent forwardne&s;s. If they received no &s;atisfaction in the&s;e points, war would, in tho&s;e times, have been thought very little more de&s;irable than peace. Succe&s;s, victory, glory, national reputation, na|tional power, were the circum&s;tances that for|merly made war, and the train of war tolerable
<PB N="27" REF="46">
to a nation. The probability of a favourable event, and the beneficial con&s;equences of victory, when attained, were always more or le&s;s in con|templation. At pre&s;ent the fa&s;hionable ta&s;te &s;eems to be, for <HI>efforts</HI> without <HI>vigour, expence</HI> without <HI>return, preparation</HI> without <HI>action,</HI> and <HI>war</HI> with|out an <HI>object.</HI></P>
<P>I will not &s;ay, whether I have been well or ill employed; but abounding in lei&s;ure, as you will ea&s;ily believe, I have read over all the public per|formances of the friends of Mini&s;try. Not one, I imagine, has e&s;caped me. The coffee hou&s;e I frequent is well &s;upplied with the papers. The papers are no le&s;s liberally &s;upplied with politi|cal e&s;&s;ays and paragraphs on the mini&s;terial &s;ide of the que&s;tion. At no time have Mini&s;ters more carefully attended to this mode of commu|nication with the public; and they have &s;pared no expence nor trouble to engage diligent and indu&s;trious writers in their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance has &s;truck me as very &s;ingu|lar. In all the cour&s;e of this exten&s;ive and va|rious reading, I never once ob&s;erved a letter, or even one &s;ingle paragraph, &s;o much as in&s;inuating, that <Q REND="inline">"the war with America had been hitherto conducted with common &s;en&s;e."</Q> If my recol|lection has failed me, &s;ome per&s;on of more reten|tive
<PB N="28" REF="47">
memory or more accurate ob&s;ervation will be &s;o good as to &s;upply my defects.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this trifling omi&s;&s;ion, the Mini&s;ters, I mu&s;t admit, have not been wholly wanting to them&s;elves. They have carried on a notable war with the <HI>Mile-End A&s;&s;embly.</HI> They have fought a very &s;trenuous battle with <HI>Mr. Ma&s;|call.</HI> In my opinion, they have gained a com|pleat victory over him. They have laid <HI>Mr. Joel</HI> on his back. <HI>Atkin&s;on Bu&s;h</HI> mu&s;t be a bold man if he ventures to &s;hew his face&mdash;For all the&s;e advantages, I give them full credit. But &s;till the <HI>pro&s;cribed Hancock</HI> &s;its at the head of <HI>The United Colonies;</HI> and <HI>Putnam the carpenter,</HI> be|&s;ieges and &s;tarves twelve thou&s;and Briti&s;h troops with four of the be&s;t Engli&s;h Generals at their head.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was written in October. Three winter months have not, we may believe, mended the &s;ituation of tho&s;e gallant men wantonly made the victims of mini&s;terial infatuation.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have concealed nothing which has happened in favour of our great &s;tate&s;man. The above is a &s;hort but fair and impartial account of the advantages obtained, and the lo&s;&s;es &s;uffered by the mini&s;terial arms of all &s;orts, at home and abroad, during the glorious campaign of 1775.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="48" MS="y">
At what a price all this glory has been ac|quired we &s;hall not immediately know, though our inqui&s;itive Parliament is &s;o &s;hortly to meet. Some part of the burthen we &s;hall feel very &s;oon. But the whole charge certainly will not be then di&s;played; le&s;t it &s;hould throw &s;ome damp on the &s;pirit of addre&s;&s;ing, which at pre&s;ent &s;eems the grand re&s;ource of the nation. There will un|doubtedly be a large and con&s;tant demand on this fund of national politene&s;s; and it will as largely and con&s;tantly an&s;wer the drafts at &s;ight. Whatever may become of others, there is no danger that <HI>this Bank</HI> &s;hould ever be obliged to &s;top payment.</P>
<P>The vein of addre&s;&s;ing, in a &s;ituation like the pre&s;ent, is a phaenomenon rather unu&s;ual in the political world, though in the moral it is highly commendable. The compliments paid to defeat and misfortune, are the effect of true genero|&s;ity. If the thing went no further, all might be well. But it grows &s;erious when a compliment conveys a tru&s;t. To this hour the want of &s;uc|ce&s;s was always deemed a pre&s;umption of the want of wi&s;dom. It went beyond a <HI>pre&s;umption,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="49">
if the ill &s;ucce&s;s had attended upon great forces. Men grew out of humour, and became unwilling to commit their lives and fortunes to the care of tho&s;e in who&s;e hands they found that nothing pro&s;pered.</P>
<P>If they thought a war eligible, this became a &s;trong motive again&s;t confiding to the unfortu|nate, in that preci&s;e &s;ituation, in which of all others Fortune has the greate&s;t &s;hare. They would not &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"we ought to go to war with America, therefore, make a complimentary ad|dre&s;s to tho&s;e who have <HI>lo&s;t</HI> that country. We ought to u&s;e <HI>force;</HI> therefore &s;upport tho&s;e under who&s;e direction <HI>power</HI> has &s;unk into <HI>impotence.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The period for the&s;e congratulatory addre&s;&s;es, and this &s;olemn approbation of mini&s;terial con|duct is well cho&s;en, and &s;trongly marked. It &s;urely de&s;erves to be as much di&s;tingui&s;hed as an <HI>Aera</HI> in the Chronicles of Great Britain, as any event that has happened &s;ince the foundation of this monarchy.

<HEAD>OBJECT OF THE WAR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday, October 24, 1775.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MR. MILLER.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Remember Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> &s;omewhere in his hi&s;tory ob&s;erves, that amid&s;t all the calamities of the great civil war between Charles the Fir&s;t and his people, the Engli&s;h enjoyed this &s;ingular good fortune, that <HI>no foreign nation interfered in their quarrels.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hume</HI> is in the right. The circum&s;tance was fortunate; and I am afraid it will continue to be &s;ingular. The pre&s;ent melancholy civil war is of another kind, and is to be carried on, as it was begun, upon very different principles. It is a war in which, as <HI>foreigners</HI> have the &s;ole intere&s;t, none but <HI>foreigners</HI> will finally decide. In the great civil war between Charles the Fir&s;t and the national Repre&s;entative, both parties had in view &s;uch an object as u&s;ually pa&s;&s;es for ra|tional.
<PB N="33" REF="52" MS="y">
Had Charles the Fir&s;t actually &s;ubdued his Parliament, he might po&s;&s;ibly have levied taxes without the con&s;ent of tho&s;e who were to pay them. He would then have been to England, what England claims to be to America, the &s;ole virtual Repre&s;entative of his people. Their con|&s;ent would have been involved in his will. To re&s;i&s;t would be to rebel. So far the politics of Charles the Fir&s;t and ours go on together; but there is a &s;light circum&s;tance in which they differ.</P>
<P>If he had carried his point, his power would have led to profit. The kingdom which he would have reduced, lay under his eye; and all its concerns were within his gra&s;p. By a common revenue e&s;tabli&s;hment, and a moderate &s;tanding army, there was no doubt but that he might ea&s;ily have drawn into his own coffers, as much of the property of his &s;ubjects as would have &s;upported that e&s;tabli&s;hment, and paid that army; and left a &s;urplus be&s;ides, for the purpo&s;es of avarice, ambition, or di&s;&s;ipation. The nation had the &s;ame intere&s;t to defend, which the King had to attack. Here was a war that had an ob|ject. Prince and people &s;trongly intere&s;ted, they wanted no intervention of foreigners to decide their quarrel.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="53" MS="y">
But if Charles the Fir&s;t had involved him&s;elf in all his difficulties, in order to tax, without their con&s;ent, a people who were 3000 miles by &s;ea di&s;tant from him&mdash;if the people at that di&s;tance were &s;cattered over a Wilderne&s;s, 1700 miles in length, and 500 in breadth&mdash;if their extended &s;ea co&s;t was pervious by a thou&s;and havens, bays and creeks to every fraud, and every elu|&s;ion of duties&mdash;if the&s;e duties, by the be&s;t col|lection, far from being able to &s;upport a va&s;t &s;tanding army, a powerful navy, and numerous fortifications, would con&s;e&s;&s;edly not &s;uffice for the maintenance of a tenth part of a competent Revenue e&s;tabli&s;hment&mdash;if &s;uch had been the at|tempts of Charles the Fir&s;t, nothing but the con|&s;ideration of his in&s;anity could have drawn the lea&s;t degree of pity upon his misfortunes. The great &s;ubject of curio&s;ity would be, how he came to find any abettors in &s;o frantic an attempt. It would have been but natural for him to &s;eek his in&s;truments in every country but his own; as tho&s;e people would be the mo&s;t fit to fight his battles who were the lea&s;t acquainted with his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Charles, be&s;ides the obvious lucrative advan|tage which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, had another apology for his arbitrary undertakings; and Mr. Hume is too &s;kilful an advocate to let it pa&s;s. His peo|ple
<PB N="35" REF="54" MS="y">
were far from liberal in their &s;upplies. They frequently even refu&s;ed any &s;ub&s;idy to his greate&s;t wants. What an aggravation would it have been of his mi&s;conduct, if all the world had known, and if he him&s;elf had confe&s;&s;ed on re|cord, that the grants of his people had outgone his <HI>requi&s;itions,</HI> and that their <HI>&s;upplies,</HI> while vo|luntary, had far exceeded their <HI>abilities?</HI> Join then together the two &s;uppo&s;itions which I have made, and let every candid man form a judg|ment on the wi&s;dom of that &s;overeign power (call it King or Parliament, or by what name you plea&s;e) which could wage a de&s;tructive war for an object of taxation impo&s;&s;ible to be attained, in order to avoid having recour&s;e to a quiet mode of application which had never failed.</P>
<P>It is in our power ob&s;tinately to &s;hut our eyes to the genuine appearances of things. If we plea&s;e, we may &s;top our ears again&s;t rea&s;on; or we may prevent the voice of truth from being heard, by the din of our own pa&s;&s;ionate talk|ing. But &s;till rea&s;on and truth will one way or other have their operation; and though not &s;een or heard, they will cau&s;e them&s;elves to be felt. They are at this minute in full energy; and are now, though not &s;o &s;en&s;ibly in the mode as in the effects, acting with irre&s;i&s;tible power. While Parliament votes, and Corporations ad|dre&s;s,
<PB N="36" REF="55">
a general torpor and deadne&s;s have be|numbed the whole community. The &s;tate is paralytic. We have nothing left alive, but that mi&s;erable and feeble voice, with which we &s;ue for compa&s;&s;ion to the enemies of our former greatne&s;s, and call upon foreign nations to ob|tain for us &s;ome &s;ort of authority among our own people.</P>
<P>England feels &s;he has no intere&s;t in this quar|rel. The army cannot be recruited to any to|lerable degree of &s;trength, much le&s;s to a force adequate to the nece&s;&s;ities of the pre&s;ent bloody &s;ervice. It is becau&s;e the yet uncorrupted body of the people of England are brave and generous, that they do not chu&s;e to &s;hed their blood in this quarrel. All the ink that has been, or ever can be &s;hed in addre&s;&s;es, will not per&s;uade them to join with <HI>German va&s;&s;als</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian &s;laves,</HI> in exterminating the little remnant of freedom which &s;till continues to ble&s;s the world.</P>
<P>Un&s;upported by Engli&s;h arms, the Mini&s;ters fly to Scotland. The gallant and &s;agacious peo|ple of that country, worthy to be for ever, in &s;entiments as in government, one with Eng|land, have declined to employ their valour for the de&s;truction of their &s;ole a&s;ylum from de&s;po|ti&s;m and oppr&s;&s;ioen. They will not chu&s;e to pa&s;s from praedial to military &s;ervitude. They
<PB N="37" REF="56">
will not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be turned into mer|chandize, for the profit of tho&s;e men who are bartering for lucrative places and for regiments, the lives that are not yet &s;acrificed to their ava|rice as landlords.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;omewhat mi&s;taken with re|gard to the <HI>Parliament</HI> of Ireland, and the <HI>people</HI> of Scotland.</NOTE> The Scotch are indeed going to America; but they are going as &s;ettlers, not as &s;oldiers. An illegal order has been i&s;&s;ued to compel them by force to continue in the hou&s;e of bondage, and to keep them from ta&s;ting the fertility and freedom of America.</P>
<P>The application to Ireland has been as un&s;uc|ce&s;sful as it was indecent. Did they imagine that generous people to be &s;uch an herd of blun|derers, as to &s;pill their blood, in order to enable Mini&s;ters to tax, without their con&s;ent, all the countries &s;ubject to this crown? The Iri&s;h Ro|man Catholics feel as the Prote&s;tants do. They al&s;o know America as an A&s;ylum. None but a very few vagabonds have been captivated by the half guinea liberality of the Earl of Ken|more, or the military rhetoric of Major Boyle Roche.</P>
<P>Engli&s;h, Scotch, Iri&s;h, failing; Canada, French and Popi&s;h, has been applied to as the la&s;t re|&s;ource among Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. Canada, French and Popi&s;h, have refu&s;ed. Laws have been &s;u&s;|pended, and military de&s;poti&s;m proclaimed in
<PB N="38" REF="57">
The Canadians have heard the &s;ound of liberty.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;try thus di&s;owned, not in words but in practice by every old and every new &s;ubject of this empire, are obliged to go about begging at the door of every petty Court and every venal State of Germany. They have pro&s;trated Eng|li&s;h dignity before Ru&s;&s;ian de&s;poti&s;m. They are &s;atisfied to &s;neak like &s;ervile Gentlemen U&s;hers before the <HI>State</HI> of the French Amba&s;&s;ador; while all Europe looks with deri&s;ion at their aukward, &s;econd-hand airs, and their imitated grimaces of exotic complai&s;ance. They &s;toop their &s;tiff backs, to ki&s;s the baffled hands of Spain. Our heroic Mini&s;ters tremble before <HI>the fugitives from Algiers.</HI> Sir Jo&s;eph Yorke, under their direc|tion, is employed in a manner that is certainly odious to &s;o liberal a mind as his; and, indeed, mu&s;t be &s;o to any man who has &s;erved his coun|try in better times. He is alert and active, and watches day and night. But he watches, not the Councils, but the Ports of Holland. He is obliged to thru&s;t his no&s;e into the hatchway of every Dutch Dogger, and to rummage and cro&s;s examine every paltry Package. The Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary of England is &s;unk into an atten|tive Tidewaiter. But all this expence of honour has purcha&s;ed &s;carce any &s;ort of advantage. Their
<PB N="39" REF="58">
negociations and their &s;earches have been as un|&s;ucce&s;sful and as impotent as their arms. All they can as yet do, is to deliver over Gibraltar and Minorca to Hanoverians. But though they have failed in procuring other nations to de&s;troy our Colonies, our Colonies may imitate their ex|ample in calling <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It does not appear that the Colonies have as yet made any attempt to call in foreign &s;uccours. That humiliating glory has been left to the haughty &s;uperior. We hear that we have lately had &s;ome appearance of &s;ucce&s;s in clearing the jails and ho&s;pitals of Germany, much to the relief of tho&s;e coun|tries, whatever it may be to ours. The He&s;&s;ian and Brun&s;wick reinforcements are for the greater part raw and new levies. A &s;pe|cimen of them, of about three hundred, has been lately exhibited on the &s;hore of Kent. If this complication of mi&s;ery and villainy can be manufactured into an army by the &s;kill and au|thority of a German Prince, yet will Lord G. Germaine be quite po&s;itive that an adventurous ambitious General of that &s;tamp with 16,000 men under his command, will indure the inconve|niences of &s;uch a &s;iege as our own troops have &s;u&s;tained? Would not, the ju&s;t complaints that General Carleton makes of being left unprovided with the &s;upplies he expected, ari&s;e to &s;ome|thing wor&s;e than complaints from a foreign Prince? Might not &s;uch a man &s;o treated, think him&s;elf ju&s;tified to re&s;ent as well as complain? Is it impo&s;&s;ible that he might quit the party, that did not &s;upport him in the manner &s;tipulated? Is it impo&s;&s;ible that a German Prince might find a territory as large and a revenue as great as what he left in Germany? The&s;e are hints, the con&s;ideration of the&s;e things may not be unworthy of the <HI>wi&s;e&s;t heads</HI> among them.</NOTE> in foreign aid; and as with
<PB N="40" REF="59">
a more decent excu&s;e, &s;o in all human probabi|lity with better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In this unparalelled &s;tate of di&s;tre&s;s and de|gradation of their country, the Mini&s;ters are not without their comforts. They hold their places; they enjoy their &s;alaries; they receive their ad|dre&s;&s;es. At pre&s;ent they are in high &s;pirits.

They inform us that they intend to change their mode of making war. They have it &s;eems, by &s;ome means or other, at length found out, that to be be&s;ieged is not the way to con|quer. They propo&s;e to ravage what they are not capable of governing; and abandoning all idea of being conquerors and legi&s;lators, they are in hopes of becoming &s;ucce&s;sful Pirates.</P>

<HEAD>THE PLOT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day, November 2.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Mr. MILLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Monday the 23d of October, 1775, in the morning, Mr. Sayre, Banker, in Ox|ford Road, was &s;eized by King's Me&s;&s;engers, upon an accu&s;ation of nothing le&s;s than an hor|rid and dete&s;table enterprize again&s;t the <HI>per&s;onal Liberty</HI> of our Sovereign. In the evening of that day he was committed to the Tower, by a war|rant for <HI>trea&s;onable practices.</HI> On the 24th the London Gazette announced to the world, that he was committed for <HI>High Trea&s;on.</HI> On the 25th all his friends, and even his coun&s;el, were refu&s;ed admittance to him. On the 27th he was carried before Lord Mansfield;&mdash;and without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, doubt, or delay, he was ad|mitted to bail, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">50l. for each of his two &s;ecurities, and 500l. for him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="61">
This is an exact, though &s;hort chronological Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Banker's</HI> Plot, one of the grand events, which, amid&s;t the &s;plendor of &s;o many illu&s;trious actions in peace and war, among &s;o many laws wi&s;ely planned and firmly executed, will, in future times, di&s;tingui&s;h the memorable period of the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration. The na|ture of the offence for which Mr. Sayre was committed to the Tower, and guarded with &s;uch unu&s;ual &s;trictne&s;s and &s;everity, or the validity of the charge, or the legality or ju&s;tice of the proceeding, will be e&s;timated from the extraor|dinary bail, which has been accepted on the Ha|beas Corpus of this eminent State Criminal.</P>
<P>It is known, that no bail can be admitted to an accu&s;ation of High Trea&s;on, laid upon any tolerable ground. I do not mean exactly to li|mit the power of the Chief Ju&s;tice of England on the&s;e occa&s;ions, but it is univer&s;ally known, that &s;uch is the general nature of the offence. The &s;ecurity in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e amounts (in effect) to no bail at all. The culprit him&s;elf, his partner, and his attorney, are the per&s;ons bound; and they are not all three bound in a &s;um amounting to more than a <HI>thou&s;and pound.</HI> It is this <HI>&s;pecial</HI> bail which forms at this moment the indi&s;&s;oluble texture of the triple cord of public &s;ecurity. It is at this price that the mo&s;t
<PB N="43" REF="62">
de&s;perate of traitors, if we believe the Mini&s;ter, has purcha&s;ed the means of e&s;caping from the puni&s;hment of the pa&s;t, or of en&s;uring the per|petration of his future crimes.</P>
<P>I believe there is no man under a &s;erious charge of High Trea&s;on, who would not readily redeem his life at the price of one thou&s;and pounds. There is no man daring enough to conceive &s;uch a Trea&s;on, to whom the fear of lo&s;ing a thou|&s;and pounds would prove any re&s;traint in his black de&s;igns. We all remember the clamour that was rai&s;ed again&s;t Lord Mansfield, for ad|mitting to bail, upon a &s;um nearly as con&s;i|derable as this, a man who was accu&s;ed of <HI>&s;teal|ing a few quires of paper.</HI> No faction has as yet gone &s;uch lengths in this ca&s;e; or been impudent enough to accu&s;e that great Magi&s;trate of illegality or partiality, in taking &s;uch bail for a per&s;on who &s;tood charged with an attempt to <HI>&s;teal the King.</HI></P>
<P>Attempts, which in private ca&s;es would be but mi&s;demeanors, or &s;ometimes no definite offence at all, change their nature in ca&s;es which relate to the King's per&s;on, and become crimes of the greate&s;t magnitude, as they certainly are of the blacke&s;t die. Some time ago the depriving a few <HI>Printers Devils</HI> of their liberty, for a &s;hort time, was e&s;timated at an higher &s;um than an
<PB N="44" REF="63">
attempt to take away the liberty of our Sove|reign, and with it of cour&s;e the liberty, as well as the happine&s;s of all his people. It could not be, that Lord Mansfield, who&s;e affection to his Maje&s;ty cannot be di&s;puted, did not value his gracious Sovereign, benefactor, and friend, at more than one thou&s;and pound. This e&s;tima|tion would fall below all precedents in &s;imilar ca&s;es, the value of money in different times and countries con&s;idered. It was not therefore the crime, but the charge and the proce&s;s that were treated with &s;uch ju&s;t contempt, by a firm, enlightened, and con&s;titutional Chief Ju&s;tice. Our guardian angel of the laws did but touch this diabolical plot with the &s;pear of his pointed &s;agacity, when in&s;tantly it &s;tarted up in its own proper &s;hape, and moved the deri&s;ion of the world.</P>
<P>Here we mu&s;t commend the Chief Ju&s;tice. No man ever &s;poke more con&s;titutional language, or ever acted in a more con&s;titutional manner. But when we have &s;aid this of Lord Mansfield, there end all the commendations that we can be&s;tow upon the &s;ervants of the crown. It does not appear why they &s;hould at all have taken up Mr. Sayre, much le&s;s why they &s;hould have committed him <HI>clo&s;e pri&s;oner</HI> to the Tower, upon grounds, which at the very fir&s;t view, a man of &s;en&s;e and knowledge perceived to be &s;o contemptible. It
<PB N="45" REF="64">
does not appear upon what grounds a Mini&s;ter of State cho&s;e to order &s;o clo&s;e and rigorous a con|finement, for a matter which the head of the law con&s;idered as meriting in effect no confine ment at all.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;es of our Mini&s;ters were &s;o compleatly taken away (I &s;uppo&s;e by the horror of &s;o dread|ful a plot) that they did not know for what par|ticular matter it was, that they had cho&s;en to commit this de&s;perate and formidable con&s;pi|rator. The warrant for <HI>taking</HI> Mr. Sayre is for <HI>High Trea&s;on,</HI>&mdash;the warrant for his <HI>commitment</HI> is for <HI>Trea&s;onable Practices;</HI>&mdash;but when they come to inform the public of their proceedings, thro' the Gazette, they return to their old ground, and tell us they have committed him upon a charge of <HI>High Trea&s;on.</HI> What could be the rea&s;on of all this confu&s;ion, contradiction, and prevarication? Their excu&s;e on this affair, as on the affairs of America, and indeed on mo&s;t others, is their want of knowledge on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Candour calls on me to admit, that a Secre|tary of State who has, or a&s;&s;umes the power of acting as a Magi&s;trate, is not therefore obliged, or &s;uppo&s;ed to have in him&s;elf any knowledge of <HI>law</HI> or of his own <HI>duty</HI> in that &s;ituation; or indeed any knowledge of tho&s;e rules of <HI>prudence,</HI> with which men, who have no authority to &s;up|port
<PB N="46" REF="65">
them in their errors, are obliged to regulate their conduct. What I lament in men of their excellent di&s;po&s;itions, and what they will join me in lamenting, is, that they have <HI>no power.</HI></P>
<P>The King's Privy Council was not able to cammand the attendance of any of the great Law Officers of the Crown. The Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>would</HI> not be pre&s;ent. The Attorney General (no one &s;u&s;pects it was through fear) declined attendance. It is &s;aid, that Mr. Wedderburne was the law director on this occa&s;ion. But un|til Mr. Wedderburne avows this folly, it is not hand&s;ome, and I fear it might po&s;&s;ibly be action|able to charge a gentleman of a learned profe&s;&s;ion with any &s;hare in &s;o <HI>unbooki&s;h</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Shake&s;pear's Othello.</NOTE> a proceeding.</P>
<P>One might have imagined that the ma&s;ter of the <HI>Thief-takers,</HI> whom (with that propriety which di&s;tingui&s;hes all their conduct) they thought pro|per to a&s;&s;ume as their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and on whom the &s;afety of the King and kingdom, and the exe|cution of their mo&s;t important laws, were re&s;ted in &s;uch a critical moment, he, one would ima|gine, might have acquired, in <HI>his</HI> exten&s;ive prac|tices, a little more knowledge of bu&s;ine&s;s. But it is po&s;&s;ible, that this great magi&s;trate, like &s;ome other great men on great occa&s;ions, was
<PB N="47" REF="66">
called to Council only for form, to give the &s;anc|tion of his important pre&s;ence to this very grave proceeding. His advice was, mo&s;t probably, not taken though his figure was exhibited. The Mini&s;ters very naturally meant to cover them&s;elves by the name and authority of Sir John Fielding.</P>
<P>They wi&s;ely con&s;idered, that the eyes not only of England and America, but of all Europe, were upon them. They therefore cho&s;e to be|&s;tow upon this tran&s;action a degree of public &s;olemnity equal to its intrin&s;ic value, To ac|compli&s;h this intention, the Property-man of the Court Theartre had orders to fill a part in this &s;plendid <HI>&s;pectacle</HI> with our blind &s;eer, the &s;age <HI>Tire&s;ias</HI> of the Briti&s;h Nation. The whole <HI>corps diplomatique</HI> was infinitely edified. The foreign Mini&s;ters now look with admiration (an admira|tion for the fir&s;t time wholly unmixed with envy) on the profound wi&s;dom, a&s;toni&s;hing re|&s;ources, and incredible &s;ucce&s;s of our State&s;men, in all their concerns, from the evacuation of Bo&s;ton to the di&s;charge of Mr. Sayre.</P>
<P>We are yet to &s;ee the &s;econd part of this bu&s;i|ne&s;s opened; and to behold Mr. Sayre in the character of a pro&s;ecutor, not a culprit; of an a&s;&s;ailant, not a defender. We &s;hall &s;ee him, like his brethren of Bo&s;ton, be&s;ieging that Mini|&s;ter
<PB N="48" REF="67">
who had blocked up his &s;hop. Here the ca&s;e will be greatly altered; and &s;uch contempt|ible bail will not, I apprehend, be taken, in the action, which Mr. Sayre, will probably bring again&s;t the Secretary of State, for having &s;eized and committed a man in trade upon &s;uch frivo|lous grounds, and by &s;uch an illegal method of proceeding. The King's Exchequer mu&s;t &s;up|port the credit of Mr. Sayre's Bank. There will be new rea&s;on to call upon this good|natured Parliament to pay the debts of his Maje&s;ty's Civil Li&s;t, incurred by the want of knowledge, precipitancy, and &s;hallow politics of his Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>This will now become a regular head, and &s;et|tled charge in the account of the Trea&s;urer of the Chamber: <TABLE>

<P>It is no trivial &s;um which has hitherto filled up, or which will hereafter fill the above blank. The charge is certain and infallible, and mu&s;t be pro|vided for; though, like the Navy Debt and the extraordinaries of the army, it cannot be brought into e&s;timate. There mu&s;t be &s;ome unknown, but important and &s;ingular advantage to a na|tion in being governed by fooli&s;h Mini&s;ters, &s;ince
<PB N="49" REF="68">
people are content to pay &s;o dearly for that bene|fit.</P>
<P>This &s;ham plot appears at fir&s;t view to have been a mi&s;erable and ludicrous affair from the beginning to the end. Yet, however conducted, I do not think it was wholly devoid of a <HI>certain &s;ort of policy</HI> in the original &s;cheme. It might an&s;wer a pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, and at a critical mo|ment. Its operation la&s;ted as long as political plots are nece&s;&s;ary to hold. Like <HI>Moor-Game</HI> brought from the North, the <HI>haut gout</HI> and <HI>fu|mette</HI> recommend it for a day; the next it &s;tinks.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion under a few &s;mall di&s;advantages. Among other items of charge, they were under &s;ome &s;light apprehen|&s;ions that they might po&s;&s;ibly be called to &s;ome account for the <HI>lo&s;s of an empire.</HI> They felt them&s;elves in danger. They were obliged, like tho&s;e they &s;ent to other di&s;agreeable &s;ervices, to fortify them&s;elves on the <HI>Neck.</HI> The addre&s;&s;es were their intrenchments; the plot was the mine; and thus well &s;ecured in front they did not fear the unpaid body of <HI>Rifle-Men,</HI> who were charged and ready to let fly at them.</P>
<P>The bringing down his Maje&s;ty to his Parlia|ment under a <HI>double</HI> guard, and with a double
<PB N="50" REF="69">
proportion of the mob of con&s;tables <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable that Mini&s;ters, as if in &s;corn of their own plot, &s;ent the King to his Parliament, with this extraordinary parade of guards <HI>while the con&s;pirator was &s;afely locked up in the Tower;</HI> but ever &s;ince he has been di&s;charged and at <HI>liberty</HI> to make any attempts, the attendance on the King has been re|markably trifling.</NOTE> and trading Ju&s;tices, in order to guard that guard, was on the whole, a manoeuvre not ill calculated to in&s;pire panic terrors, and rob the poor multitude of their little remaining &s;tock of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;try were &s;en&s;ible of the zeal and affection of the people to their Prince. They hoped that the danger of the &s;tate might be for|gotten in the &s;uppo&s;ed danger of the Soverign. They hoped that our anxiety for his Maje&s;ty's &s;afety might &s;u&s;pend our re&s;entment for the lo&s;s of his empire; and that in this general di&s;may and confu&s;ion, nobody would enquire into the merits of that invaluable &s;peech, which had e&s;|caped to the &s;anctuary of Parliament, through &s;o many &s;urrounding perils.</P>
<P>This ludicrous proceeding has a &s;erious mo|ral. Mini&s;ters ought not to trifle with the &s;afety of their ma&s;ter. They ought not to pre&s;ume to make that &s;acred object the play-thing of their paltry politics. They ought to be as far from en|couraging a manife&s;tly corrupt, or an evidently
<PB N="51" REF="70">
trivial charge, as from neglecting a grave and weighty information. The levity or low cun|ning which tempts them to &s;uch petty arts, have effects that may be fatal. They tend to le&s;&s;en that horror which u&s;ed to attend a charge of High Trea&s;on. By fal&s;e alarms they prepare the way for real dangers. They encourage con&s;piracies by weakening the public belief in them. That man is not without a large &s;hare of the guilt of any future, wicked enterprize, who with &s;ham plots and childi&s;h &s;tories amu&s;es the public cre|dulity, always prone to believe too much or too little.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t that the &s;pirit now ri&s;ing in Parliament will animate hone&s;t men to an enquiry into the affair, without being diverted from their other important enquiries. They will know how Mi|ni&s;ters come to &s;port with High Trea&s;on, whil&s;t impeachments are hanging over their own heads. They will a&s;k how they came to deceive into the &s;upport of their ruinous mea&s;ures, men in the highe&s;t offices, and the mo&s;t entitled to a faithful communication? They will a&s;k why they be|trayed private tru&s;t as well as public confi|dence? They will a&s;k the Mini&s;ters, why, in the la&s;t year, they demanded an implicit reliance from their exten&s;ive knowledge, and this year argue their innocence from their ignorance? They will call for an account of the trea&s;ures,
<PB N="52" REF="71">
the arms, the commerce, the reputation, the dominion of their country, which have been fooli&s;hly &s;quandered, feebly employed, wantonly &s;acrificed, &s;hamefully tarni&s;hed, lamentably lo&s;t. When the&s;e que&s;tions receive the only an&s;wers they can receive, and the&s;e an&s;wers the only re|ply they de&s;erve, then may there be &s;ome hopes of &s;alvation for this country.</P>

<P>I really do not conceive an object more worthy of a manly and re&s;pectful compa&s;&s;ion, than a great mind &s;acrificing its deare&s;t intere&s;t and ri&s;king even total ruin upon a principle of dignity. But, before a man becomes a martyr to any opinion, he ought to be &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ome notion of the merits of the cau&s;e in which he gives &s;o painful a proof of his &s;incerity. If we had not had ten years war with Mr. Wilkes, begun on the principles, and ended in the manner in which that ever memo|rable
<PB N="53" REF="72">
war was begun and ended, before our eyes, we might be at a lo&s;s to conceive what ideas of dig|nity our Mini&s;ters had conceived. I believe it is generally remembered, that that noble and &s;uc|ce&s;sful &s;truggle was made entirely for dignity. Our American war was al&s;o undertaken for dig|nity. All the world &s;ees with what dignity it is conducted. All the world &s;ees the dignity which was &s;o uniformly &s;u&s;tained in the Tragi-comedy of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Maje&s;ty pre&s;erved, or the Sayre Plot di&s;co|vered."</Q> The rule of the drama was there in|tirely well ob&s;erved.
<Q><L>&s;ervetur ad imum</L>
<L>Qualis ab incepto proce&s;&s;erit, et &s;ibi con&s;tet,</L></Q>
never was known a proceeding &s;o perfectly con|&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and with every other proceed|ing of it's authors.</P>
<P>The court Gazette, at the opening of Parlia|ment announces to all Europe a de&s;ign of &s;eizing the King in his capital, in the mo&s;t frequented &s;treet of that capital, &s;urrounded by his guards, and in the very act of his &s;olemn meeting of his nobles and his people. Since the grand Gun|powder Trea&s;on we have not heard of a more de&s;perate con&s;piracy. Does any man (out of the mini&s;try) imagine that the per&s;onal honour of the King, that the glory of our nation, in a word, that Briti&s;h dignity was enhanced by this public
<PB N="54" REF="73">
avowal of &s;o daring an attempt on the &s;acred per|&s;on of a King, without u&s;ing any means to puni&s;h the criminal, to guard again&s;t his farther attempts, or to prevent the terrible effects of &s;uch a glaring example of wickedne&s;s and impunity?</P>
<P>The reputation for courage and wi&s;dom has hitherto been con&s;idered as the only &s;ource of dignity. If the danger from this con&s;piracy was contempti|ble, it was a poor di&s;play of courage to manife&s;t &s;o great an alarm upon it. If deep and &s;erious, it &s;hewed a deplorable want of wi&s;dom in doing nothing whatever in con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P>I am not &s;peaking of the hone&s;ty and ju&s;tice of that mea&s;ure toward the &s;ubject. Of this Mini&s;ters may hear at another &s;ea&s;on. I confine my&s;elf &s;olely to the manner in which they con&s;ulted the <HI>dignity</HI> of their Sovereign, and his reputation among&s;t the other Crowned Heads of Europe. In&s;tead of an Object of awe and re&s;pect, he is at be&s;t held out as an object of compa&s;&s;ion; when with all his virtues he could not be pre&s;erved from &s;uch attempts; and with all the aid of his laws, and all the &s;upplementary authority of his Par|liament, he was not able to puni&s;h them.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters have no way to &s;ave them&s;elves from the&s;e imputations, but by admitting that they did not them&s;elves believe one word of that plot, which they announced to the world with &s;o much
<PB N="55" REF="74">
parade. Had they believed it, they would, they mu&s;t, have brought it before Parliament. It was their duty &s;o to do. That I confe&s;s is not &s;o &s;trong a proof that they would have done &s;o. But it was their intere&s;t to have done it; and in the cour&s;e of things, if they had known matter, that carried even a grave appearance, they certainly would have laid it before Parliament. But they have never opened their lips in either Hou&s;e upon the &s;ubject. Even their well trained majority was not to be tru&s;ted with di&s;gracing them&s;elves by the adoption of &s;o fooli&s;h and &s;o foul a &s;cheme. <HI>One</HI> act of public di&s;grace is merely mini&s;terial, and has not been communicated with Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>If they have been &s;ilent in Parliament, have they opened their mouths in the Courts of Ju&s;tice, were this daring attempt, (if it ever had birth,) ought to have been pur&s;ued to the death of the bold and bad contrivers? So far from pur&s;uing Mr. Sayre in a Court of Ju&s;tice, they were not to be provoked to a word of ju&s;tification of their conduct, when Mr. Sayre brought them there by claiming his right of &s;tanding in his country like other innocent men, free from charge and free from bail.</P>
<P>The&s;e abortive plots tend to di&s;grace the Crown, the Law, and the Magi&s;trates of England, with other &s;tates. They tend to render the King
<PB N="56" REF="75">
jealous of his people. In whatever light they are viewed, they are at once ridiculous and alarming.</P>
<P>But our worthy repre&s;entatives have looked on with perfect indifference. To them the wi&s;dom, or the folly; the reality, or the fal&s;ity of the plot; the danger of the King, or of the &s;ubject; the ba&s;e neglect of the mini&s;try in dropping, or the &s;candalous diligence in beginning, the pro&s;ecution; the honour of the national wi&s;dom, or the national ju&s;tice; the&s;e are matters in which they have no concern. This is an improvement in the fa&s;hion|able <HI>nonchalance</HI> and inattention in modern good breeding. One would have imagined that com|mon civility &s;hould have induced a Parliament, &s;o ver&s;ed in polite addre&s;s, to make &s;ome enquiry how his Maje&s;ty had re&s;ted after &s;uch an attempt. The circum&s;tance, of the attempt being made on a vi&s;it to them, might have called upon them for &s;ome &s;ort of notice. But times as well as coun|tries have their cu&s;toms.</P>

<SALUTE>MR. MILLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Duke of Grafton has been removed from the Office of Privy Seal. The mere re|moval of a Mini&s;ter is a matter of little moment to the people. But the cau&s;e of his removal may be of the highe&s;t importance; as it is frequently the &s;ure&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t indication of the &s;y&s;tem of politics which predominates at Court.</P>
<P>The offence given by the Duke of Grafton is known to all the world. A per&s;on of the highe&s;t rank in the kingdom, in an office of the highe&s;t rank in the State, very lately fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of State, in great per&s;onal favour with his Maje&s;ty, clo&s;ely connected by the &s;tronge&s;t ties of affinity, inclination, and intere&s;t with a leading part of the admini&s;tration, and a con&s;tant and powerful &s;upporter of their mea&s;ures.&mdash;This man, finding
<PB N="58" REF="77" MS="y">
the Briti&s;h empire in America lo&s;t by the mea|&s;ures he had implicitly &s;upported, at la&s;t pre|&s;umes to de&s;ire &s;ome little information in this pe|rilous &s;tate of our affairs. He is immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his employment, with every po&s;|&s;ible mark of di&s;plea&s;ure and di&s;grace.</P>
<P>The favourers of Admini&s;tration are now ac|quainted with the terms upon which they are to &s;upport government. A great deal of the &s;upport not only of well-wi&s;hers within doors but even of the Members of both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment, mu&s;t be implicit. Many matters of detail undoubtedly cannot, &s;ome matters certainly ought not, to be communicated. The advantage of having men of great rank and intere&s;t in their country, in high &s;tation, is this, and perhaps this only: we &s;uppo&s;e they have a &s;pirit proportioned to their &s;tation; that they look for &s;omething el&s;e in office be&s;ides the &s;alary; that they are entitled to information and explanation; that <HI>they</HI> at lea&s;t are depo&s;itaries of the real &s;ecret. On this pre|&s;umption, the &s;upport of &s;uch great per&s;ons be|comes a pledge to the public, that the &s;teps taken by the directing part of Mini&s;try, are taken upon proper ground. When the people at large have rea&s;on to believe this to be the ca&s;e, they are apt patiently to acquie&s;ce in the ruling wi&s;dom.

<P>It has been now, for the fir&s;t time, thought proper to remove the veil that was drawn between the people and the government. We are now in|formed, that the &s;upport of the greate&s;t men in the kingdom, and in the highe&s;t offices, is to be as blind and uninformed as that of Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officer, who by order of the Trea&s;ury votes at an election for a Nabob.</P>
<P>Ignorant credulity, pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, blind obedience, are the virtues which politicians have hitherto required, and &s;ometimes found&mdash;in the mob. Until our happy days, the&s;e laudable di&s;|po&s;itions have not been thought qualifications for the highe&s;t offices in a great empire. At pre&s;ent it is not enough to impo&s;e upon the people. The purpo&s;e for which one half of the Mini&s;try &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, is to impo&s;e upon the other half. By this happy invention it is, that a Mini&s;try, compo&s;ed of jar|ring principles and adver&s;e opinions, is to be ren|dered unanimous.</P>
<P>A &s;ort of frauds I admit have been often prac|ti&s;ed in matters of &s;tate. The public danger has been often repre&s;ented much beyond the reality, in order that the fulle&s;t preparations might be made again&s;t it; becau&s;e &s;uperfluous comprehends

nece&s;&s;ary exertion; and it is better to be a good deal beyond, than the lea&s;t degree &s;hort of &s;ecurity. But this is the fir&s;t time that real difficulties were concealed, in order that weak arrangements &s;hould be ju&s;tified; or that feeble arrangements were avowedly cho&s;en, in order to hide a danger of the fir&s;t magnitude. In former times, whate|ver little artifices were u&s;ed, were external. Till now, &s;y&s;tematical, internal delu&s;ion, and mutual impo&s;itions of Mini&s;ters, have not been openly profe&s;&s;ed as maxims of government.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Lords pre&s;ented the other day a &s;cene as in&s;tructive as it was &s;ingular. An alter|cation had ari&s;en on the &s;tate of the navy. It was thought extraordinary la&s;t year, when the reduc|tion of America by force was re&s;olved on, that the naval e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hould be reduced from 20,000 to 18,000 &s;eamen. It was then thought &s;omething unaccountable, that operations of vio|lence &s;hould be commenced by a reduction of &s;trength. At that time, however, the fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty, in the fir&s;t a&s;&s;embly of the na|tion, &s;olemnly declared, that that he <HI>knew</HI> the e&s;tabli&s;hment, as then voted at 18,000 men, to be &s;ufficient for all its purpo&s;es. This year, the &s;ame per&s;on, in the &s;ame office, in the &s;ame a&s;|&s;embly, has declared, that he la&s;t year <HI>knew</HI> it to be <HI>not</HI> &s;ufficient.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="80">
The &s;pecies of courage and magnanimity which &s;upports a man in &s;uch a declaration, excited no &s;urpri&s;e. The character of that truly noble per|&s;on is perfectly and univer&s;ally under&s;tood. It was the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> he a&s;&s;igned for the la&s;t year's im|po&s;ition, that &s;truck every man who heard it. He was obliged (he &s;aid) to make that repre&s;enta|tion to the Hou&s;e, becau&s;e if he had laid open the real extent and nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;ervice in which the naval power was to be employed, he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;hould not have been &s;upported by Lords in high office."</Q></P>
<P>The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for this gro&s;s impo&s;ition, on the hereditary council of the Crown who agreed to that e&s;tabli&s;hment, on the Commons who voted it, and on the nation which acqui|e&s;ced in it, is in effect, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that if the fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty had not deceived the public, he could not have been happy enough to de|ceive his colleagues."</Q> To &s;educe us into a war, it mu&s;t carry the appearance of peace. Our danger mu&s;t be concealed, le&s;t we &s;hould keep out of it, or prepare again&s;t it. A civil war is in it&s;elf &s;o de&s;irable to Mini&s;ters, that we mu&s;t run into it without either knowledge or prepara|tion. This pious and prudent war was to plea&s;e, like virtue, for its own &s;ake; and to be recom|mended, even by the mi&s;eries which were to at|tend it. We mu&s;t re&s;olve to cut the throats of
<PB N="62" REF="81">
the Americans, even though our own defeat, even though famine, blockade, lo&s;s of reputa|tion, and lo&s;s of empire, &s;hould be the inevit|able con&s;equence. The&s;e di&s;a&s;ters were to be|come the pledge of our per&s;everance in this glo|rious de&s;ign. When we &s;hould have &s;uffered enough of &s;hame, and enough of damage, in the fir&s;t feeble effort, it was pre&s;umed we &s;hould grow &s;ufficiently irritated (not with our advi&s;ers but our enemies) to continue in tho&s;e ho&s;tilities which, with information, we never could have commenced; that having been brought into dif|ficulties by ignorance, we &s;hould plunge deeper by pa&s;&s;ion; that feeling we had &s;uffered by weak exertions, we might be reconciled to the &s;tronge&s;t; that di&s;gu&s;ted with the ill effects of moderate expences, we might &s;et all on one de&s;perate ca&s;t, in the wild imagination that with a boundle&s;s charge we might either retrieve our error, or compleat our ruin. A timid and treacherous be|ginning; a bold and de&s;perate progre&s;s; a con|clu&s;ion to be apprehended in the &s;ilence of horror, not to be expre&s;&s;ed in words!</P>
<P>Avowing this &s;cheme, &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters have confe&s;&s;ed, that they had been deceivers; mo&s;t that they had been deceived. Tho&s;e who are not content to be deceivers, or deceived any

<P>One would think, that country gentlemen had too much of plain hone&s;ty, and plain &s;en&s;e, after &s;o public a manife&s;tation of impo&s;ture, de|lu&s;ion, and ignorance, to act their part any longer in this tragical farce. Implicit confi|dence in confe&s;&s;ed impo&s;ture, &s;eems rather too much. Ju&s;tice mu&s;t be done to many of the country gentlemen. Steady &s;upporters of go|vernment, they did not mean to be abettors of a faction. When they heard Mini&s;ters confe&s;s, that the facts were mi&s;taken and the rea&s;on|ings erroneous, on which the plans of govern|ment had been formed for &s;everal years pa&s;t, they thought them&s;elves obliged to look a little more carefully about them. The public misfor|tunes had taught them to pre&s;ume le&s;s, and to examine more. They thought they had a right, after &s;o many promi&s;es broken, and &s;o many ex|pectations di&s;appointed, to demand more ex|plicit information.</P>
<P>They ob&s;erved, that the per&s;on called the Mi|ni&s;ter, on the fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, was totally undecided concerning the part that he was to act. The &s;econd day they heard, or thought they heard him declare, that he would readily aban|don
<PB N="64" REF="83">
taxation, repeal the obnoxious acts, and reduce things to the condition of 1763. A day or two after, they heard him explain him&s;elf to have meant nothing like it. The &s;ucceeding day he explained away his explanation. One day conce&s;&s;ion was to &s;et all to rights; the next all depended on force. Sometimes a revenue was to be the true object of the war. Some|times an American revenue was the wilde&s;t pro|ject in the world. Sometimes the Americans aimed at independency, and nothing le&s;s could &s;atisfy them. Sometimes it was again&s;t nature, that they &s;hould &s;uffer all the evils of war, ra|ther than not accept of rea&s;onable conditions. Sometimes conce&s;&s;ions on our part were to pre|cede an armi&s;tice; &s;ometimes the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the rebels was to precede all treaty. No two men in office agreed among them&s;elves on the &s;ame day; no man agreed with him&s;elf for two days together. The beginning of almo&s;t all their &s;peeches, was at irreconcileable variance with the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>La&s;t year a few garbled papers were laid before parliament, and a civil and military plan, &s;uch as they were. This year one part of the mi|ni&s;try confe&s;&s;ing their bad information, and ano|ther their evil intentions, call for a much greater mea&s;ure of confidence than ever. In&s;tead of
<PB N="65" REF="84">
laying garbled, mutilated papers before the Hou&s;e, they produce none. The ta&s;k-ma&s;ters le&s;&s;en the provender of their hacks, in propor|tion as they increa&s;e their labour.</P>
<P>Gentlemen call for the advices from America. They are refu&s;ed. They demand the &s;tate of their troops in that quarter. It is denied them. The general outline of the mini&s;terial plan is &s;o|licited. It is dangerous to divulge it. It is a&s;ked, whether they have any plan at all? Still no &s;atisfaction. The public know nothing, ex|cept declarations of innocence, and acts of in|demnity; Hanoverians brought in contrary to law, and Ru&s;&s;ian Auxiliaries never to be brought at all; troops that cannot be rai&s;ed, and trea|ties that are never to be executed; powerful fleets and va&s;t armies, of which there is nothing certain but the ruinous expence.</P>
<P>Such was the language and &s;ituation of the Mini&s;ters, and &s;uch the view of affairs, even previous to the late changes. Every thing called on country gentlemen to begin to think for them&s;elves. But there is a further demand on their attention. American affairs are now taken out of the hands of Lord North. That noble Lord's Dartmouth, is re|moved, in order to mark, in the mo&s;t di&s;tinct and public manner, the total ce&s;&s;ation of Lord
<PB N="66" REF="85">
North's influence and direction in the American department.</P>
<P>A new Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord George Germaine, takes the lead in Ame|rican bu&s;ine&s;s. At pre&s;ent, therefore, Lord North's declarations, retractations, modifica|tions, explanations, and re&s;ervations, are wholly out of the que&s;tion. His Lord&s;hip is now to fall back, and, at be&s;t, to act only a &s;econdary part. Tho&s;e who &s;upported admini&s;tration, as declar|ing a per&s;onal confidence in Lord North, have that ground of confidence taken from under them. If from a &s;ort of hereditary party regard the Tories felt a re&s;pect for Lord North's family, I fear, whatever Lord George him&s;elf may do to plea&s;e them, his family does not afford him that recommendation. What then is to be the foundation of implicit tru&s;t in the new Mi|ni&s;ter? All we know is, that he has always &s;hewn a very rooted ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition to America. His Parliamentary prop is Mr. Wedderburne; his private coun&s;ellor is Governor Hutchin&s;on. This triumvirate compo&s;es the new American cabi|net. Some country gentlemen may think it right to &s;upport the&s;e Mini&s;ters with as blind a confidence as that with which they &s;upported Lord North and Lord Dartmouth, until the middle of la&s;t week. The&s;e new Mini&s;ters have been the under workmen of the late Premier.
<PB N="67" REF="86">
How they came to a&s;&s;ume the lead and direction, is a matter of curious, rather than important &s;peculation. But I &s;ee no rea&s;on for pre&s;uming, that tho&s;e who have helped to cau&s;e the&s;e di&s;trac|tions, while they were in a &s;ubordinate capacity, will re-e&s;tabli&s;h our affairs in a &s;uperior &s;itua|tion.</P>
<P>The&s;e affairs and times will &s;ift and &s;earch the principles of men. Former majorities were very mixed bodies. Many good and quiet men &s;upported Mini&s;ters from hatred of bu&s;tle and contention; from a &s;u&s;picion that oppo&s;ition was at bottom as intere&s;ted as admini&s;tration. At length mea&s;ures &s;peak a language not to be mi&s;under&s;tood. They &s;peak no longer in arguments and conjec|tures, but in effects. Our American empire is lo&s;t; and we know in who&s;e hands that calamity has happened. The Mini&s;ters are <HI>caught with the Mainer,</HI> as the Lawyers &s;ay. No majority can hide the principals or the abettors.</P>
<P>The true country gentleman will now be di&s;|tingui&s;hed from the courtier in ma&s;querade. The characteri&s;tic of a true country gentleman, is his care of the property of his con&s;tituents. He will not think that railing at rebellion is a rea&s;on for taxing his country, without any ac|count of the pa&s;t u&s;e of his &s;upplies, or any &s;e|curity for their future proper and effectual em|ployment.
<PB N="68" REF="87">
To tell him that the Americans are defective in their duty, will not be a rea&s;on for him to neglect his own, or to &s;uffer Mini&s;ters to neglect theirs. He will never believe, that the way of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing or quieting rebellion in Ame|rica, con&s;i&s;ts in encouraging deceit, negligence, or mi&s;management at home. At a time like this, a true Engli&s;h country gentleman will di&s;|tingui&s;h him&s;elf by a con&s;titutional &s;u&s;picion, and a con&s;tant de&s;ire of account and informa|tion. On the contrary, the courtier in ma&s;que|rade, like tho&s;e that compound felony in the news-papers, and adverti&s;e for &s;tolen goods, of|fers his money, and a&s;&s;ures that <Q REND="inline">"<HI>no que&s;tions will be a&s;ked.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>It is true that this latter de&s;cription of country gentlemen, not at all troubled with an imperti|nent, incommodious &s;olicitude, and teizing cu|rio&s;ity, have received, bountifully and of free grace (for they called for none) <HI>&s;ome</HI> &s;atisfaction from the Mini&s;ters for all the money they have voted. They were told, with due &s;olemnity, with much pomp, and true oracular gravity, in both Hou&s;es of Parliament, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That there is &s;omething in the nature and complexion of this country, which di&s;po&s;es it to be di&s;graced and beaten in the beginning of a war; that it has been always &s;o; and that as we have begun
<PB N="69" REF="88">
the American war in our natural and habitual manner, we &s;hall, as formerly, ri&s;e from contempt to honour, and from defeat to glory."</Q></P>
<P>I do not mean to derogate, in the &s;malle&s;t de|gree, from any one particle of this &s;atisfactory account of our pa&s;t failure, and this &s;olid ground of our future hopes. Let the facts and inferences remain for ever unimpeached. It would be cruel to nibble at the lea&s;t crum of this comfort. It is indeed the only apology that has been &s;o much as attempted, for Mini&s;ters and their &s;upporters. It is the &s;imple and &s;ole account which gentle|men have to render to their con&s;tituents at the Chri&s;tmas rece&s;s, of a <HI>Land Tax</HI> entailed on po&s;terity at four &s;hillings in the pound; and a <HI>&s;inking fund,</HI> alienated for ever from its original purpo&s;es, to an eternal but inadequate provi&s;ion for the intere&s;t of growing debts, and aggravated e&s;tabli&s;hments.</P>

<SALUTE>Mr. MILLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE gallery of the Hou&s;e of Commons has for about three weeks been &s;hut again&s;t &s;trangers, for &s;ome rea&s;on far more weighty, I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, than the mere accomodation of the few members, who, in this cold &s;ea&s;on, chu&s;e to &s;hiver on the half de&s;erted benches, or to huddle them&s;elves together, and blow their fin|gers about the Speaker's chair.</P>
<P>I am told, the Mini&s;ters complain, that their &s;peeches are mi&s;repre&s;ented; and this mi&s;repre|&s;entation is a&s;&s;igned to the Hou&s;e as a ju&s;tifiable cau&s;e for an utter exclu&s;ion of their con&s;titu|ents. With all the deference which I bear to the opinions of tho&s;e gentlemen, I mu&s;t think they are &s;omewhat mi&s;taken in this method of prevent|ing mi&s;repre&s;entation. The Hou&s;e cannot hin|der
<PB N="71" REF="90" MS="y">
the members from gratifying the curio&s;ity of their friends with accounts of what pa&s;&s;es in the debates. The &s;entiments and opinions of Mi|ni&s;ters, will very naturally be the fir&s;t object of that curio&s;ity. Pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice on the one &s;ide, and the ill conception of a drow&s;y and oblivious acquie&s;cence on the other, will, not un|naturally, render the accounts fallacious or erro|neous. Thus a material injury may be done to the language of the cleare&s;t &s;peakers, and to the &s;entiments of the mo&s;t accurate, clo&s;e, and &s;y&s;te|matic thinkers. A numerous auditory is there|fore the only &s;ecurity again&s;t the weak accounts of friends, and the malignant interpretation of enemies. Mo&s;t men, who would not have their &s;en&s;e mi&s;taken, wi&s;h to be their own interpre|ters; and tho&s;e who complain that malicious re|ports are circulated to their di&s;advantage, cannot object to an opportunity of clearing them&s;elves to the world; for I always take it as granted, that the &s;trangers, as we are called, are not more to be &s;u&s;pected by Mini&s;ters of an ill di&s;po|&s;ition towards them, than many of tho&s;e, whom it is not yet in their power to exclude.</P>
<P>This fear of mi&s;repre&s;entation being but a poor rea&s;on for turning a popular repre&s;entative into a &s;ecret conclave, I rather &s;u&s;pect, that &s;trangers are excluded, not becau&s;e Mini&s;ters are
<PB N="72" REF="91">
mi&s;repre&s;ented, but becau&s;e they cannot be un|der&s;tood. I have &s;ometimes the honour of being admitted, at a coffee hou&s;e where the members take refre&s;hment, to a conver&s;ation with &s;ome worthy gentlemen who always vote in the majo|rity. It mu&s;t be admitted in their favour, that if they are in the &s;ecret, they are perfectly worthy of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them; for they appear to be no more enlightened than my&s;elf, with regard to the objects which Mini&s;ters have in view, or with regard to their means of attaining any ob|ject whatever. In &s;aying this, I would not in&s;i|nuate a thing &s;o much to their prejudice, as that their total want of information concerning the plans, arguments, and opinions of Mini&s;ters, make the lea&s;t abatement in the zeal with which they &s;upport them.</P>
<P>Happily the Hou&s;e of Lords is more acce&s;&s;ible. What can be the cau&s;e? Is it, that this Hou&s;e, being the great natural council of the Crown, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be le&s;s in the &s;ecret of affairs, than an a&s;&s;embly merely popular? Or is it, that not being accountable to the people at a general election, the Lords are more indifferent than our worthy repre&s;entatives, about the di&s;covery of their &s;entiments? Or mu&s;t we &s;uppo&s;e, that the great Mini&s;ters there are &s;o much more clear and determinate in their ideas, than the involved

<P>In that re&s;idence of well-bred, ea&s;y, popular manners, I had lately the happine&s;s of hearing a noble and learned Peer, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es as great a &s;hare of clearne&s;s in explaining, as he does of power in guiding the public mea&s;ures. From him I thought I &s;hould have received that &s;atis|faction, which I had in vain &s;ought in other places. I was, however, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, perhaps to my &s;hame, a little di&s;appointed. <HI>Lord Mans|field,</HI> in&s;tead of opening new matter to us from his own abundant magazines of policy, thought proper to refer us to <HI>Doctor Tucker,</HI> who&s;e pam|phlet I had ju&s;t bought for a &s;hilling. Doctor Tucker is, it &s;eems, the only per&s;on who has put the long agitated que&s;tion of America on its proper bottom. Whatever many of us might have thought before, we dare no longer treat the projects of that worthy, political, and commer|cial divine, as vi&s;ionary. They have received the &s;anction of the highe&s;t authority in the kingdom for &s;tation, wit, learning, and abilities. The great author of the&s;e projects, we are told, has hit <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"upon the true alternative, either to make the Colonies &s;ubmit, or totally to abandon them, and <HI>then</HI> treat with them for peace, as an inde|pendent country."</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">With great deference, the commercial Divine is in &s;ort of agreement of opinion with this be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible Admini&s;trations. The Dean (and he is &s;worn never to be a Bi&s;hop,) is of opinion that the Colonies are po&s;itively prejedicial to this country, and the connection mi&s;chievous. The Dean therefore draws his conclu&s;ion fairly&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Get rid of the Colonis."</Q>&mdash;Allow his premi&s;es, and his conclu&s;ion is ju&s;t what every man in his &s;en&s;es would draw. If, therefore, the grave Judge agrees with the Divine, he mu&s;t allow the war to be the ab&s;urde&s;t act that madmen ever imagined in their phrenzy, yea, perhaps the mo&s;t expen&s;ive war that ever was undertaken, to in&s;ure an ob|ject that <HI>is mi&s;chievous.</HI></NOTE></P>

I &s;hould hardly have imagined, that a man of Lord Mansfield's real accuracy and penetration, could have been &s;o wonderfully &s;truck with this &s;tate of the important que&s;tion, which now en|gages the attention of the world. The alterna|tive propo&s;ed by the Doctor, under favour, &s;eems not to be a true &s;tate of the que&s;tion; for be|&s;ides <HI>ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>total &s;eparation</HI> there, is in all internal di&s;putes evidently a third me|thod, I mean that of <HI>reconciliation and compromi&s;e.</HI> This is a method which, though it &s;eems now out of fa&s;hion, has formerly been &s;ometimes men|tioned, when nations were involved in a Civil War.</P>

<P>The name of Murray, the pride of every alum|nus of We&s;tmin&s;ter, has led me into this fanciful excur&s;ion among the tombs.

The Divine is of opinion, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of America is of no advantage to us, and therefore with a &s;pi|rit becoming a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, as well as a good politician, he is for giving the Coloni&s;ts (though not with the be&s;t grace in the world) that independency, which, according to him, they &s;o much de&s;ire to obtain, and which, as he thinks,
<PB N="77" REF="96" MS="y">
it will co&s;t us little or nothing to be&s;tow. His ground appears to me to be exceedingly bad; but if he can once e&s;tabli&s;h it, he is far from rea&s;oning ill. His conclu&s;ion flows directly and irre&s;i&s;tibly from his premi&s;es.</P>
<P>The Bon Mot of the Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, con|cerning two Divines, is now rather trite. One of them, whom I &s;hall not name, he &s;aid, made his religion a trade; the other, Dr. Tucker, (much to his credit in a commercial country) made trade his religion. Without venturing on &s;o much freedom with the Dean, as his Bi&s;hop may be al|lowed to u&s;e, it is certain that next to religion he has applied to this &s;ubject with the mo&s;t diligence, and with very great &s;ucce&s;s. He would have ap|plied with very little diligence to it, and with no &s;ucce&s;s at all, if he did not know that fir&s;t ele|mental principle in the cri&s;s cro&s;s row of commerce, which is&mdash;the imprudence of throwing good money after bad, and expending a capital without ex|pectation of return.</P>
<P>Lord Mansfield did not, on that day, explain how it happens, that &s;eeming at lea&s;t entirely to agree with Dr. Tucker concerning the commer|cial importance of America, he is willing to ex|hau&s;t mines of trea&s;ure, and to &s;pill &s;eas of blood, to reduce the Colonies to what he calls <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and they term <HI>&s;lavery.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="97">
<Q REND="inline">"To compel them to &s;ubmit"</Q> are words of no preci&s;e meaning. To what is it the Americans are to &s;ubmit? To regulations of trade? If Lord Mansfield agrees with the Dean of Glou|ce&s;ter, the&s;e regulations, &s;o far from being valu|able, are in reality rather mi&s;chievous to our|&s;elves. A war to compel <HI>&s;uch</HI> &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, may well be called <HI>unnatural.</HI> Is it to taxation they are to &s;ubmit? If &s;o, the end and the &s;ole end of <HI>taxation</HI> being <HI>revenue,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>profit,</HI> it is, like all other profit, a matter of calculation. If our pre&s;ent proceedings promi&s;e at any time to produce a profit commen&s;urate to the blood, ex|pence, and ri&s;que, or any profit at all, we then have an object. Whether we are likely to &s;ucceed in it, by the means we u&s;e, is another que&s;tion; but mini&s;try acting wi&s;ely or unwi&s;ely, do, in that ca&s;e, pur&s;ue &s;omething.</P>
<P>I attended with all the diligence due to his great abilities, to Lord Mansfield on that his great day, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s I received no more &s;atisfaction from him on the probability of this revenue, than I had received from the Hou&s;e of Commons, whil&s;t that Hou&s;e permitted their con&s;tituents to hear the rea&s;ons they a&s;&s;ign for the burthens they impo&s;e.</P>
<P>The nation is not kindly treated. It is docile enough, but the ma&s;ters refu&s;e to teach. To
<PB N="79" REF="98">
make a war for <HI>taxation,</HI> without an e&s;timate of <HI>revenue,</HI> is not rational. I &s;ay no wor&s;e of it. Lord Mansfield &s;hould have given this e&s;timate. He has been Chancellor of the Exchequer, or a picture I have &s;omewhere &s;een belies him. The pre&s;ent Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his bu|&s;ine&s;s at lea&s;t, does not &s;eem to be more than a picture; a very faint repre&s;entation of a great financier. With &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, an e&s;timate of this &s;ort would be of &s;omething more importance, and a little more to the point, than this learned Lord's Hi&s;tory of American hereditary di&s;affection.

<HEAD>AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday, December 9.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MR. MILLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR unhappy civil conte&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the innumerable evils which it has produced, is attended with &s;ome advantage. The &s;tate of the provinces, lately our's, is come to be under|&s;tood, even by Mini&s;ters. The utter impractica|bility of drawing a revenue from America is uni|ver&s;ally acknowledged. The point of taxation has been over and over again abandoned. It is, however, thought nece&s;&s;ary to lengthen the dura|tion, and to augment the rigours of a war begun upon the &s;ole principle of taxation. Having fir&s;t made war for that object, and that object being found impracticable, we mu&s;t now provide an object for the war. Here is a demand for inge|nuity, and Lord Mansfield &s;teps forward.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="100" MS="y">
The aim of the Colonies at ab&s;olute <HI>indepen|dency,</HI> is now made the ground of war; and le&s;t the conduct of the pre&s;ent inhabitants &s;hould not furni&s;h proof enough for the purpo&s;e, they are to be vi&s;ited with the &s;ins of their forefathers, from the third and fourth generation; and ancient hi&s;|tory is to be &s;uborned as the evidence of recent guilt. I really do not reli&s;h this method of dig|ging up the bones of departed error, in order to render the fire of per&s;ecution more inten&s;e again&s;t pre&s;ent heterodoxy. I know and confe&s;s, that the people of New England were early in their <HI>re&s;i&s;t|ance</HI> to King James. I do not pretend to defend them in <HI>that</HI> act of rebellion; or in that fondne&s;s for innovation, which, for any proof I can bring to the contrary, was their true motive for &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to the government of King William. That they did &s;o re&s;i&s;t and &s;o &s;ubmit, is a matter of fact indi&s;putable. But whether the one is, or the other, or both equally are, to be alledged as va|lid proof of their former de&s;ire of <HI>independence,</HI> is more than I can pre&s;ume to determine.</P>
<P>But &s;omething I will beg leave to &s;ay upon the whole of this method of hi&s;torically criminating our provinces. I am very certain Lord Mans|field would not &s;o much as hear of it in his <HI>judicial</HI> capacity; and on this &s;ubject, I mu&s;t appeal from the politician to the magi&s;trate.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="101">
In the fir&s;t place, his Lord&s;hip would hardly think it fair to ran&s;ack the hi&s;tory of <HI>one,</HI> or at the utmo&s;t <HI>two</HI> provinces, and the Journals of one or two a&s;&s;emblies; and on account of every mu|tinous act, or peevi&s;h vote to be found in them, to conclude <HI>twelve</HI> more to be guilty, without ci|ting one &s;ingle act or vote of any of the twelve to prove the common charge in which they are <HI>all</HI> involved. But, according to the modern mode of proceeding, in the <HI>evidence</HI> we find Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts Bay, in the <HI>&s;entence</HI> we find the colonies. This little <HI>s,</HI> &s;lipped in as if by accident, forms the &s;mall, but venomed &s;ting in the <HI>tail,</HI> that is to be mortal to two million of people. Such a loo&s;e method of crimination would do well enough in a news-paper paragraph of a mini&s;terial writer, or in a dutiful and loyal addre&s;s from a fifth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such there are among the Addre&s;&s;es the Mini&s;ters alue them&s;elves upon.</NOTE> part of a Scotch borough; but it was hardly to be expected from the accuracy and preci&s;ion of a great rea&s;oner, or from the equity and impartiality of a con&s;cientious Judge.</P>
<P>The colonies have been (until our late proceed|ings united them) unconnected and independent of each other. If the hi&s;tory of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, or Rhode I&s;land, had been a ti&s;&s;ue of rebellions, without one moment's peace or obedience, how are Penn&s;ylvania, Virginia, Maryland, the two
<PB N="83" REF="102">
Jer&s;eys, the two Carolinas, or even Connecticut, or New Hamp&s;hire, an&s;werable? It was enough to make the&s;e Colonies re&s;pon&s;ible for the acts of their own forefathers in a right line, and not to charge them with collateral delinquency, for the offences of the political progenitors of other people.</P>
<P>I am obliged, in the next place, to lament &s;e|riou&s;ly, that Lord Mansfield, in reading the hi&s;|tory of even <HI>one,</HI> (the wor&s;t if he plea&s;e) of the colonies, in order from thence to infer the guilt of the <HI>whole,</HI> &s;hould not have been able to per|ceive any thing in all that hi&s;tory be&s;ides acts of re&s;i&s;tance and revolt. I &s;hall beg leave to remind his Lord&s;hip, that until this unfortunate period, that colony (Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay) certainly never did take up arms again&s;t the Crown. It certainly did make &s;ome provi&s;ion for the &s;upport of his Maje&s;ty's government. It certainly did rai&s;e &s;ums of money, and very large &s;ums too, at &s;e|veral times, for the public &s;ervice. It certainly did &s;pill a great deal of &s;uch blood as it had to &s;pill, in the quarrels of this country. The wealth of the colony was not equal to ours, nor their blood as noble as Lord Mansfield's. But there is an eye in which the widow's mite is not altogether di&s;regarded, and in which the blood of the yeoman is not without an account.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="103">
This total omi&s;&s;ion of every act of duty, fidelity, or affection, in &s;ettling the account even of this colony, is &s;o far from being judicially fair, that in the light of mere hi&s;tory, it mu&s;t be blamed as de|fective. If I had ob&s;erved that extraordinary omi&s;|&s;ion any where but in a &s;peech of Lord Mansfield, I &s;hould have taken it for one of the wor&s;t kinds of fal&s;hood, <Q REND="inline">"a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of truth."</Q> But that omi&s;&s;ion being his, I am per&s;uaded it ari&s;es from any thing &s;ooner than an intention to deceive. I have heard that his Lord&s;hip, like other great lawyers in great practice, has frequently employed a brother of le&s;s fame, and le&s;s occupation at the Bar, in the capacity of, what the cant of We&s;t|min&s;ter-Hall calls, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>a Ca&s;e Hunter,</HI>"</Q> or <HI>Searcher for Precedents.</HI> This more laborious than intelli|gent in&s;trument, mi&s;taking Lord Mansfield's di|rections, and forgetting that his Lord&s;hip was a great parliamentary Judge, and not a retained advocate in a party cau&s;e, produced all the pre|cedents which could be u&s;eful towards e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the charge again&s;t the colonies, and accord|ing to his low idea of prudence, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed every thing which might make in their favour. I &s;hould recommend to his Lord&s;hip in&s;tantly to di&s;mi&s;s his pre&s;ent <HI>Ca&s;e Hunter,</HI> and to take &s;ome other into his &s;ervice who may be more capable of en|tering
<PB N="85" REF="104">
into his real views, and of &s;u&s;taining the true dignity of his character.</P>
<P>In this plan of &s;ub&s;tituting hereditary di&s;affec|tion as a ground for a war, in the room of taxa|tion the original object of it, but now abandoned, I have mentioned two capital errors. The one, that the charge is general, and the proof partial. The other, that the evil actions are &s;tated, and the good omitted. I mu&s;t beg leave to add a third, of perhaps as much moment as the other two.&mdash;That the&s;e things are charged as <HI>peculiar</HI> crimes to the colonies; which if they are faults, are faults of human nature in their circum&s;tances; and which, if we go on to con&s;ider as crimes, and as grounds of war or of puni&s;hment, we can|not po&s;&s;ibly enjoy any peace now or hereafter. I will endeavour to explain my&s;elf. In countries pretending to any degree of freedom, &s;truggles again&s;t exertions of power are not uncommon nor unnatural; and even claims of right on the part of the &s;ubject, &s;ometimes better, &s;ometimes wor&s;e grounded, are not to &s;urprize us. I &s;uppo&s;e our whole civil hi&s;tory is made up of &s;uch di&s;putes. If men of a certain de&s;cription were to be the judges, the people of England would be called to a &s;evere account. Mr. Hume has pa&s;&s;ed judge|ment upon many of the&s;e claims, even tho&s;e claims which are now &s;anctified by (what &s;ome &s;tate&s;men
<PB N="86" REF="105">
think) the be&s;t of all arguments, Succe&s;s. That great author con&s;iders what we now deem the rights of the people, to have been formerly inva&s;ions on the rights of the Sovereign; and the &s;truggles relative to them, he pronounces to have been conte&s;ts, in which the Crown acted only on the defen&s;ive.</P>
<P>It is no miracle if a colony, at &s;uch an im|men&s;e di&s;tance, with ill defined rights, and under no trifling commercial re&s;traints, &s;hould, at one time or other, pa&s;s &s;ome votes derogatory to the power of Parliament. Did Parliament it&s;elf at no time pa&s;s votes derogatory even to its own rights? Did Parliament never compliment the Crown with the mo&s;t &s;acred rights of the people? On the other hand, did Parliament at no time &s;hew a violent, di&s;orderly, and factious &s;pirit in any of her proceedings?</P>
<P>I believe, if Lord Mansfield &s;ends his <HI>Prece|dent Hunter</HI> to the Journals of either, or both Hou&s;es, to &s;elect from &s;uch votes matter to ground an attack on the rights of the people of England, as having at &s;ome period factiou&s;ly abu&s;ed, or &s;ervilely betrayed them, he will be &s;upplied with far more abundant, and far le&s;s que&s;tionable matter for the purpo&s;e, than in the Journals, not &s;imply of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts A&s;&s;em|bly, but in all the Journals of that whole Conti|nent.
<PB N="87" REF="106">
Yet if Parliament &s;hould by any accident happen to come to a di&s;pute with the Crown, or (what is quite impo&s;&s;ible) with the people, would it be fair to prove from the&s;e re&s;olutions, a long premeditated &s;cheme in that body, either to rob the Crown of its rights, or to e&s;tabli&s;h an arbi|trary power in the King?</P>
<P>This learned Lord will con&s;ider, on a re-hear|ing of this cau&s;e, that the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies are <HI>not</HI> permanent bodies. That for the greater part they have but a year's duration. That an A&s;|&s;embly in ill-humour with their Governor, will pa&s;s an angry re&s;olution, which one in a better temper totally di&s;regards; which is, in &s;ome time, entirely forgot; which is never acted upon, and never thought of by them&s;elves, or by any body el&s;e; until &s;ome ingenious per&s;ons, being left de&s;titute of any other pretext, choo&s;e to put toge|ther all the&s;e unconnected &s;craps, in order to make them an excu&s;e for de&s;olating the fine&s;t countries, and ruining the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing commerce, by the cruel turpitude, and unprincipled vengeance of a piratical war.</P>
<P>That the&s;e kind of votes do not &s;erve as regu|lar principles to influence the conduct of men, we know by our examples at home. Several dor|mant votes and re&s;olutions, which Lord Mansfield will neither act upon nor expunge, &s;till remain
<PB N="88" REF="107">
on the Journals of that very Hou&s;e where he &s;o ju&s;tly &s;ways with an unbounded authority. The Commons have deemed &s;ome of them highly de|rogatory to their rights. The Lords held them nece&s;&s;ary to the rights of the &s;ubject, and to the pre&s;ervation of the law of the land. I &s;peak here of the re&s;olutions in the ca&s;e of A&s;hby and White on occa&s;ion of the Ayle&s;bury election; yet though the&s;e votes &s;till remain on the Journals of the Hou&s;e of Lords, who can accu&s;e the Hou&s;e of Lords, <HI>at this day,</HI> of any attempt to &s;upport the rights of the &s;ubject, or to a&s;&s;ert the law of the land&mdash;again&s;t the preten&s;ions of the Hou&s;e of Commons? Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Holt</HI> &s;at on the very &s;eat which Lord Mansfield now fills with &s;o much more prudence. <HI>Holt</HI> countenanced tho&s;e proceedings of the Hou&s;e of Lords; and indeed it was his ir|regular zeal for the law that fir&s;t gave ri&s;e to them. But is it fair, from thence to &s;uppo&s;e Lord Man&s;|field chargeable with the&s;e or any other irregular or blameable proceedings, or with the intemperate zeal of Chief Ju&s;tice Holt?</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ent I &s;ubmit the&s;e few ob&s;ervations to tho&s;e gentlemen, who &s;ome time ago made war with &s;o much eagerne&s;s to compel the Colonies to contribute to the &s;upport of empire.

<P>If we did not know to a certainty, that not a &s;hilling is &s;pent in England upon elections; and that the emoluments, &s;o liberally di&s;tributed in Parliament, have no &s;hare in producing any part of that complai&s;ance to government, which di&s;|tingui&s;hes our age, and puts to &s;hame the &s;tubborn &s;pirit of our ance&s;tors, we might, in&s;tead of being a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch in&s;tances of oppo&s;ition, be rather &s;urpri&s;ed, how it has happened, that in popular a&s;|&s;emblies &s;o little managed, the oppo&s;ition to govern|ment has not been greater, more frequent, more fierce, and more exten&s;ive.

rejected petitions, with now and then a challenge <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Governor Hutchin&s;on's famous &s;peech.</NOTE> to di&s;pute on the origin of government, I can find nothing that has been practi&s;ed to <Q REND="inline">"tame the genius of the &s;tubborn plain,"</Q> or to mollify the hereditary &s;pirit of independency, that is charged upon the American A&s;&s;emblies. Under &s;uch indolent neglect, and &s;uch churli&s;h attentions, I could not po&s;itively an&s;wer for the mellowne&s;s and tractability even of a civilized Briti&s;h Parlia|ment. I &s;hould not however conclude, from &s;ome &s;our humours in our Hou&s;es of Parliament, that a barren <HI>independence</HI> was the object of their wi&s;hes; but that, like pevi&s;h virgins, they longed for &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ition to the authority of acts of Parlia|ment is not a thing new in the dependencies of this empire, nor confined to America. A denial of that authority in much greater extent, had once been very popular in Ireland. <HI>Molineux,</HI> one of their mo&s;t celebrated authors, (a great natural philo&s;opher like Doctor Franklin) a friend and a corre&s;podent of Locke, wrote a book which is &s;till in reque&s;t. The object of this book is to prove, that England had no power to make <HI>any laws whatever</HI> to bind Ireland. The a&s;&s;ertion is not limited to taxes; it is as broad and general as legi&s;lature it|&s;elf on the large&s;t plan. That book indeed was

burnt by the hands of the common hangman <HI>here;</HI> but the doctrines gained &s;o much ground <HI>there,</HI> that the Judges who admitted appeals to England were per&s;ecuted by the Iri&s;h Hou&s;es of Lords and Commons with the greate&s;t rigour and a&s;perity, and obliged to fly in a body to England.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this a declaratory act was pa&s;&s;ed, a&s;&s;erting the &s;upreme legi&s;lative authority of Great Britain. Nothing further was done. No troops were &s;ent, or employed to enforce obedience. Time was given for the public ferment to &s;ub&s;ide. The appeal to the Hou&s;e of Lords in England, was left to find its own way by its own utility; and utility effected that which force could not have effected. The Iri&s;h &s;uitors found an advantage in a judicature removed from local affections and lo|cal prejudices. At the &s;ame time the Iri&s;h Par|liament was <HI>&s;oothed,</HI> in&s;tead of being <HI>bullied.</HI> The leading intere&s;ts were gained. The &s;tubborn were &s;oftened, and the angry pacified. By de|grees, as it was natural, the &s;torm was blown over. The Iri&s;h Parliament kept its re&s;olutions. England received its appeals. No har&s;h laws were pa&s;&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of a <HI>te&s;t.</HI> No <HI>tax</HI> was im|po&s;ed for a <HI>trial</HI> of obedience.

<P>In Ireland it was not only in votes and re&s;olu|tions of Parliament, that the authority of Great Britain has met with oppo&s;ition. The re&s;i&s;tance to the trade laws by tumultuous violence, has been frequent and often &s;ucce&s;sful. Wool was and is carried off in great quantities; and great mobs have frequently de&s;troyed imported goods in one of the principal cities of that kingdom; while other mobs intimidated officers from preventing an export of prohibited manufactures in the other. It is not long &s;ince the exportation of live cattle to England was prevented by violence; a violence at which the Magi&s;trates of Ireland thought pro|per to wink. Parliament thought proper to wink, in its turn, at that violence and that neglect.</P>
<P>But if Parliament, on hearing of the&s;e di&s;or|ders, had directed the offending Iri&s;h ports to be blocked up, until the King &s;hould think proper to open them: If, on the neglect of Magi&s;trates (full as chargeable on Ireland as America) an Act of Parliament had violently &s;ubverted the corpo|rate rights of their cities: If, on the votes of the Iri&s;h Parliament, derogatory to the authority of the &s;upreme legi&s;lature, they had violently changed the con&s;titution of the &s;econdary Parlia|ment:

If they had refu&s;ed all peace to Ireland, until the bani&s;hed Judges had re-a&s;&s;umed their function, and until full compen&s;ation was made to them for their lo&s;&s;es,&mdash;there is no doubt that war alone would have &s;ettled our controver&s;y with Ireland, as it mu&s;t, if we per&s;evere in the pre&s;ent mea&s;ure, &s;ettle our controver&s;y with America.</P>

<P>Admini&s;tration has lately furni&s;hed a &s;ignal proof of their own opinion of the wi&s;dom of en|forcing all the rights of the &s;upreme legi&s;lature. It was but the other day (the beginning of this &s;e&s;&s;ion) that government applied to the Iri&s;h Par|liament for liberal grants, in order to &s;upply very large deficiencies. One would &s;uppo&s;e, from the doctrines of Lord Mansfield and his colleagues, concerning America, that the Mini&s;ter in the Iri&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, in order to &s;ucceed, mu&s;t have opened his Budget by an high a&s;&s;ertion of the rights of the Engli&s;h Parliament to tax Ire|land; and that he had concluded by de&s;iring them, on the plan of Lord North's <HI>conciliatory</HI> motion, to furni&s;h &s;uch a contingent to the &s;upport of em|pire as Parliament here &s;hould think proper. The proceeding of that &s;ucce&s;sful Mini&s;ter was the direct rever&s;e. In&s;tead of getting the Iri&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons to acknowledge this right, he <HI>him&s;elf</HI> in effect di&s;claimed it. He even denied, that the Engli&s;h Mini&s;try ever had a&s;&s;erted it; and he de&s;cribed the &s;peeches on that &s;ubject in the Engli&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons (though made by men in the greate&s;t offices) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as nothing more than

have &s;hewn that the Parliament of Ireland never made any formal acknowledgement of the power of this legi&s;lature to bind that kingdom; that the power of England there aro&s;e from our not pu&s;h|ing every point; and that the a&s;toni&s;hing ob&s;e|quiou&s;ne&s;s of Ireland at this hour, is owing to our not having made u&s;e of any one of tho&s;e me|thods of a&s;&s;erting authority, which have been re|commended and u&s;ed in America.

<P>IT &s;eems to be in the natural cour&s;e of things, that men are very rarely brought to a &s;en&s;e of guilt or folly, but through the medium of &s;uf|fering. We are obliged to the Mini&s;try for hav|ing placed us in this &s;chool of whole&s;ome di&s;ci|pline.</P>
<P>The mi&s;conduct of the pre&s;ent war will by degrees lead the nation into a di&s;po&s;ition to en|quire into the ju&s;tice of it. Never was a war more open to an impartial examination of its me|rits. No Glare of fal&s;e glory in the execution of our American mea&s;ures, has hidden the de|fects, or gilded over the errors of the original plan. We have only to pray, that our in&s;truc|tion may not come too late for our amendment.</P>

I cannot ea&s;ily quit the opinion, that however bitterly we may quarrel, there is &s;till &s;uch a bot|tom of good nature, genero&s;ity, and good &s;en&s;e, both in the European and American part of the Engli&s;h nation, as will at length incline the one to hold out unequivocal, &s;olid, <HI>hone&s;t</HI> terms of ac|commodation, and induce the other to meet tho&s;e terms (though late and ungracious in the offer) with a cordial and dutiful acquie&s;cence.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Americans are at war," (&s;ays Lord Mansfield, the great a&s;&s;ertor of the plan of ho&s;|tility) "they are acting on the <HI>offen&s;ive</HI>&mdash;whe|ther we were <HI>right or wrong,</HI> we mu&s;t proceed&mdash;we mu&s;t add violence to violence, rigour to rigour&mdash;we are not to di&s;criminate the inno|cent from the guilty&mdash;if we do not kill them, they will kill us."</Q></P>
<P>It is really &s;ingular that a man in the cool de|cline of life, bred through the whole cour&s;e of it in a profe&s;&s;ion of peace, a Civil Magi&s;trate, a Judge, covered to the chin with judicial pur|ple, and bloodle&s;s un&s;potted ermins, &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed above all others, for a character of hazard and de&s;peratene&s;s in his coun&s;els. Lord Mansfield's politics always &s;tand upon a preci|pice. When he acted with others, in advi&s;ing the late coercive mea&s;ures, he alone was under no delu&s;ion.

When men have the bayonet to each other's brea&s;t, there is no time for rea&s;oning. But men deliberating at their ea&s;e, are not in that de&s;perate &s;ituation. It is not therefore nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be animated with the&s;e de&s;pe|rate &s;entiments. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the State&s;man, and that of the General, ought never to be con|founded. It is the Province of the latter to con|&s;ider only how War is to be <HI>made.</HI> It is the duty of the former &s;ometimes to con&s;ider how war is to be <HI>ended.</HI> Reconciliation, treaty, negocia|tion, and conce&s;&s;ion enter into the plan of the State&s;man, though not in the operations of the General. If Lord Mansfield's &s;entiments &s;hould prevail as maxims of policy, it would follow, that when men, upon whatever grounds, are driven to draw their &s;words, there mu&s;t be no peace until one party or the other is exter|minated.</P>
<P>That learned Lord re&s;ts much on the <HI>offen&s;ive war</HI> undertaken by the Americans, in (what is called) the Inva&s;ion of Canada. This he adduces as a proof of their de&s;ign of independency. If war had been as much Lord Mansfield's &s;tudy, as it &s;eems to be his inclination, he mu&s;t have perceived, that it never was, nor ever could be confined to &s;trict defence. The very idea is full of ab&s;urdity. When war is once begun, the
<PB N="106" REF="125">
manner of conducting it, will be &s;uch as bids the faire&s;t for &s;ucce&s;s. It concludes nothing concern|ing the original motive for ho&s;tility, nor con|cerning the propriety or impropriety of making peace.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things &s;tand upon grounds totally dif|ferent; the de&s;ire of independency, like every other motive to war, mu&s;t be judged of by the proceedings previous to that event.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, I can conceive a ca&s;e, in which <HI>Scotland</HI> might take up arms, Scotland might de|fend the terms of the treaty of union, even again&s;t the unlimitable authority of Parliament, which that treaty, by <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a prepo&s;terous parade of civil arrangements,"</Q> certainly does <HI>affect</HI> to limit. I can conceive in argument, that acts of parliament might pa&s;s to exclude the &s;ixteen Peers of Scotland from their &s;eats in the Hou&s;e of Lords&mdash;or to alter the pre&s;ent happy e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Church of Scotland&mdash;or to change her laws for tho&s;e of England&mdash;or on the plea of her increa&s;e of trade and wealth, to rai&s;e the proportion of their land-tax. I can conceive too the <HI>po&s;&s;ibility,</HI> that many Murrays, many Humes, many Campbells, many Stuarts, many Wedderburnes, many Dunda&s;&s;es, and many El|liotts, might take up arms in favour of tho&s;e limitations of the power of Parliament, which
<PB N="107" REF="126">
the act of Union <HI>affects</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h; and not contenting them&s;elves with defending <HI>Sterling,</HI> and blocking up <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> they might enter <HI>England,</HI> and lay &s;iege to <HI>Berwick,</HI> or penetrate to <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI> But I &s;hould not therefore infer, that our Northern Kin&s;men, who thus took up arms, were aiming at an <HI>independency,</HI> which would deprive &s;o many of them of the well-earned emoluments, which are the con&s;equence of their connection with England.</P>
<P>If &s;uch a ca&s;e were to happen, I venture to a&s;|&s;ure Lord Mansfield, that I, and many Engli&s;h|men of far other con&s;equence, would hear him plead in favour of peace, and for <HI>tho&s;e</HI> rebels in 1776, with as much approbation, as we felt when he pleaded for ju&s;tice again&s;t <HI>other</HI> rebels in 1746. If any Lord, heated with faction, or intoxicated with Court favour, &s;hould then tell him in debate, that Engli&s;hmen were not to look at the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e&mdash;that we mu&s;t not di&s;tingui&s;h the innocent from the guilty&mdash;that his countrymen had acted on the offen&s;ive&mdash;that if we did not kill them, they would kill us!&mdash;we might pardon &s;uch a Lord his prejudice, from our indulgence to his zeal; but we could never be brought to approve of his temper, or to adopt his opinions.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="127">
If another Lord at the expence of his can|dour and judgement, &s;hould chu&s;e to di&s;play his knowledge in hi&s;tory, and recapitulate all the ravages of the Scotch from the earlie&s;t times; their natural adherence to our natural enemy, France; their fierce &s;truggles for independency, notwith&s;tanding the well-proved rights of our ancient Kings&mdash;If a third (for &s;uch a load of calumny would be too great for the &s;houlders of any two ordinary orators) &s;hould carry down the &s;tory to the pre&s;ent day; if he &s;hould &s;tate the de&s;ign of a &s;eparate &s;ettlement of their crown in favour of the Pretender, from which their Chiefs were brought off with &s;o much difficulty, and at &s;o great an expence; if this odious remembrancer &s;hould then revive the memory of the two rebel|lions &s;ince the act of Union, for the purpo&s;e of de&s;troying that union, all this might &s;ound plau|&s;ible to &s;ome prejudiced ears; but I think in well di&s;po&s;ed minds, it would excite the &s;tronge&s;t in|dignation. I &s;hould rejoice to hear the thunder of that eloquence which Lord Mansfield would certainly hurl at the unfeeling &s;ophi&s;try of this unju&s;t, invidious, and plau&s;ible kind of ar|gument again&s;t peace. He would have the hearts and applau&s;es of all true Engli&s;hmen. True Engli&s;hmen would not fear that Scotland would be made ungovernable by our lenity; they

would readily tru&s;t to the fraternal affection of our Scotch brethren for a re&s;toration of la&s;ting peace; and with it, the rich Commerce of that country, and the &s;ervice and &s;ociety of tho&s;e few of its natives, who might not think fit to repa&s;s the Tweed, to enjoy at home the &s;weets of that liberty which their valour had purcha&s;ed for their country.</P>
<P>In this manner I &s;hould rea&s;on on a Scotch re|bellion growing from &s;uch a principle. I mean a rebellion for pre&s;erving them&s;elves in a &s;tate of freedom; not a rebellion for the purpo&s;e of re|ducing them&s;elves and us to a common &s;lavery. I cannot avoid applying the &s;ame rea&s;onings to America. I would endeavour to make peace with both on the <HI>avowed</HI> ground of the war; and I per&s;uade my&s;elf, that whatever the lan|guage of a few North-Britons about the Court, or expecting to get about the Court, may be, the body of the Scotch nation think and argue as I do.</P>
<P>I have no right to endeavour at di&s;covering by divination the &s;ecret motives of any man's con|duct; whil&s;t the o&s;ten&s;ible are &s;uch as may fairly influence an hone&s;t and a rea&s;onable man. To &s;upport in argument, that independency was the original object of American re&s;i&s;tance, we mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume, or prove, that they had no colourable
<PB N="110" REF="129">
complaint or grievance. Lord Mansfield has too much honour and good &s;en&s;e to a&s;&s;ert, that there was nothing colourable or plau&s;ible in their objection to their being taxed, in their circum|&s;tances and &s;ituation, without their con&s;ent. The practice on our &s;ide may, for aught I know, be reconciled to principles of &s;trict formal <HI>law;</HI> but we all know it can never be reconciled to any principles of <HI>liberty.</HI> The Que&s;tion is then, whether an attempt to govern them contrary to the principles of liberty, could be a real cau&s;e of quarrel, or was &s;o idle and frivolous, as to oblige us to &s;earch for &s;ome other ground of their conduct.</P>
<P>Whatever the fir&s;t cau&s;e was, or whatever di&s;orders aro&s;e from it, the Americans did not go to extremities upon <HI>that.</HI> It is &s;ome proof of their not having premeditated a &s;cheme of in|dependency, that they waited for &s;everal other grievances before they took up arms.</P>
<P>Bo&s;ton lo&s;t its port, and the Colony of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ett's Bay forfeited its Charter&mdash;ju&s;tly &s;ays Lord Mansfield, but certainly without charge, evidence or hearing. Men con&s;ider the right of being heard, as of &s;ome import in ju&s;tice; if it be not, Lord Mansfield's office mu&s;t become a finecure. Among other human frailties, men have a natural love for their local con&s;titutions

and particular privileges. We mu&s;t allow that (however merited) the lo&s;s of a favourite form of Government will be con&s;idered and felt as a very great hard&s;hip. Nations have thought an arbitrary and compul&s;ory change, even of ha|bits, to be grievous. A form of government changed, is a matter of &s;omewhat more con&s;e|quence than the compul&s;ory deprivation of a flapped hat at Madrid, or being &s;tripped of the plaid, and forced into breeches in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader need &s;carce be told, that in the year 1766 the attempt to oblige the Spaniards by force to leave off a &s;louched hat that was in u&s;e among them, created &s;uch a di&s;turbance among the people of Madrid, as obliged the King to fly from his capital, and made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to &s;end his Favourite out of the kingdom, who has never returned &s;ince. Much le&s;s do we &s;uppo&s;e it nece&s;&s;ary to inform the reader, that the permi&s;&s;ion of quitting his breeches, and re&s;uming his plaid, is at this moment held out as a bribe to allure the Highlanders into the new levies again&s;t America.</NOTE> High|lands.</P>
<P>The bringing the per&s;ons of the Americans to trial in England, by a revival and exten&s;ion of a Statute of Henry the VIIIth; and the &s;ending them by an original act of George the IIId, to England, to look for ju&s;tice on any &s;oldier or Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officer who &s;hould commit murder on their relation,&mdash;the&s;e have al&s;o &s;omething of the air of a grievance. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the

Act for preventing their Fi&s;hery, or of that for prohibiting all intercour&s;e between Colony and Co|lony,&mdash;all the&s;e have &s;urely &s;o much the air of hard&s;hips (I mean to tho&s;e who &s;uffer under them) that I &s;hould be much le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed to find a people at length provoked to independency by &s;uch acts, than I am to hear them accu&s;ed of originally &s;cheming that independency becau&s;e they re&s;i&s;ted them. Men are not always ready to humble them&s;elves even before their Creator, and to acknowledge his puni&s;hments for tokens of loving-kindne&s;s. With men they are more in|clined to di&s;pute; and the arguments which per|fectly &s;atisfy tho&s;e who are in ha&s;te to inflict pu|ni&s;hment, are not quite &s;o convincing to tho&s;e who are to &s;uffer it.</P>
<P>All tho&s;e laws (which look &s;evere even in cold reading) preceded the commencement of ho&s;tilities, offe&s;inve or defen&s;ive. It is not true, that a de&s;ire of free &s;ubjection is in nature the &s;ame thing with a &s;cheme of independence; and we may &s;uppo&s;e men earne&s;t to pre&s;erve privileges, without rejecting government.</P>
<P>The Colonies, like others who have engaged in wars with their Sovereign, had therefore their grievance. But there the likene&s;s &s;tops; for there are perhaps no in&s;tances on record of a people in &s;uch a &s;ituation, who have per&s;evered
<PB N="113" REF="132">
with &s;uch a pertinacious humility, in repeating their &s;upplications for redre&s;s. There are few or no in&s;tances of men in arms again&s;t the ordinary Authority, who have &s;o long confined their applications &s;olely to their own &s;overeign. Scarce any, where they have religiou&s;ly avoided all caballing and tampering with foreign Powers. None where they have &s;o nobly paid their debts to the commerce of that power, with which they were at war. Whatever power we have of &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting without them, or of acting again&s;t them, is owing in a great mea&s;ure to their de&s;ire of avoid|ing a final rupture with us. Men aiming at independency could never have acted in this man|ner.</P>
<P>Why, in common &s;en&s;e, &s;hould we be more irritated again&s;t the Coloni&s;t than again&s;t other nations? or why &s;hould we u&s;e other rules to prevent pacification, than we u&s;e towards a foreign power? I &s;hould be glad to know whether this mode of rea&s;oning concerning old delinquency, or modern ill de&s;ign, was adopted at the late treaty of Paris? Did the late Duke of Bedford's in&s;tructions oblige him to a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the mo|tives of France and Spain for half a century back? I don't find that our Court has received any &s;atisfaction on that head. If the zeal and in|du&s;try
<PB N="114" REF="133">
of Sir John Dalrymple, or Mr. Macpher&s;on have made any di&s;covery in this curious mode of negotiation, they will favour the world with a new quarto volume for the information of future State&s;men. In the mean time, I mu&s;t think, that I do Ju&s;tice to the late Duke of Bedford (a Man of &s;en&s;e, and a good practical man of bu&s;ine&s;s) in &s;uppo&s;ing that he troubled him&s;elf with no idle enquiries that could ob&s;truct the work of pacifica|tion. I do not hear that Lord Mansfield has ever accu&s;ed that Duke of a neglect duty.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t not treat with Rebels! What hi&s;|tory is it that &s;upplies us with this maxim? Lord Mansfield will allow, that the war again&s;t Charles the Fir&s;t was a rebellion; Lord Claren|don, I believe, &s;tiles it by pre-eminence the <HI>great rebellion,</HI>&mdash;does the hi&s;tory of that time &s;upply us with no treaty between Charles the Fir&s;t and the people in arms again&s;t him? Go to earlier times. How was the conte&s;t between Stephen and Henry? Stephen was con&s;idered as an u&s;ur|per, and perhaps he was &s;o. He treated Henry's partizans as rebels; but the&s;e har&s;h names of Rebel and U&s;urper never prevented negotiation. Treaty and battle went on, as it were, hand in hand; and at la&s;t the conte&s;t ended in a com|promi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="134">
The &s;hort and violent rebellion of Wat Ty|ler, &s;hort as it was, yet afforded time for treating, and that too by the King in per&s;on. Does the Scotch Hi&s;tory &s;upply no in&s;tances of treaties between the rebellious Lords and their Kings? All hi&s;tories are full of them. Government often finds it &s;afer to treat with her &s;ubjects, and to yield too, than to ri&s;k the uncertain event of arms.</P>
<P>But in all wars foreign or civil, in all di&s;|putes public or private, it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible to terminate a controver&s;y while one of the litigant parties chu&s;es to a&s;&s;ume a &s;ort of &s;upernatural ta|lent of di&s;covering the motives of mens actions; and loftily tells his adver&s;ary, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I dont value your offers and profe&s;&s;ions. I know you mean what you dont &s;ay; and I will not treat with you on the avowed and apparent cau&s;e of the quarrel, until my curio&s;ity is &s;atisfied upon the ground of a &s;u&s;picion which I am re&s;olved to entertain."</Q> I am per&s;uaded that this learned Lord would not argue &s;o inconclu&s;ively, or wa&s;te his breath upon a point not in i&s;&s;ue, if the real object of Mini&s;try was to terminate the di&s;pute. What his Lord&s;hip's object is, I who take the liberty of complaining of his faculty of divination, and who am, by no means, pro|vided with the endle&s;s line of his &s;agacity in fathom|ing

the motives of men, do not at all know,&mdash;and certainly dare not gue&s;s. But the effect of the conduct of his friends in pertinaciou&s;ly con|tinuing and weakly conducting a war without an object, will inevitably operate to the di&s;member|ment of the Briti&s;h Empire.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day, June 9, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MR. MILLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my paper of the 20th of January la&s;t, I com|pleated, to the be&s;t of my power, the little plan I had originally formed. I had propo&s;ed to take a view of the policy of the American war; its objects; its conduct; and the motives for en|gaging in it. When this was done, being no po|litician by profe&s;&s;ion, I laid down my pen. I re|&s;ume it for a moment, in order to make a few re|marks upon the manner in which the Mini&s;try have handled their's. I have formerly endea|voured to do ju&s;tice to their merit as State&s;men; I am now to con&s;ider their &s;kill as writers.</P>
<P>As all men have their virtues a little balanced by &s;ome failings, it is &s;urely a good-natured part not to dwell upon the qualities they are deficient
<PB N="118" REF="137">
in, but rather to fix our attention on tho&s;e points of their character, in which they evidently excell. I &s;hould think it the cruelle&s;t thing in the world to dwell upon Lord George Germain's conduct of the civil war; but I am happy to join with the world in applauding his Lord&s;hip's dexterous ma|nagement of the Gazette.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t under his au&s;pices, and animated by his example, our commanders, by happily <HI>&s;hifting</HI> of their po&s;ition, by taking the re&s;olution of <HI>eva|cuating</HI> towns, and by effecting <HI>retreats</HI> without lo&s;s, are (though quite in a new way) conquering Provinces abroad; his Lord&s;hip is employed, ac|cording to the &s;ounde&s;t principles of the be&s;t cri|tics, in recording their great exploits at home.</P>
<P>Livy has been cen&s;ured as diffu&s;e; Sallu&s;t, Thu|cydides, and Tacitus, have been criticized for an affected brevity, bordering on the ob&s;cure. The&s;e general remarks &s;avour of pedantry, and meer li|terary cant. To judge of the faults or excellence of the diffu&s;e, or the conci&s;e, of the per&s;picuous, or the ob&s;cure &s;tyles, we mu&s;t con&s;ider well the nature of the &s;ubject, and the de&s;ign of the au|thor. No univer&s;al rule can be laid down. Some things cannot be di&s;played too amply, and too minutely to the public curio&s;ity. Others had bet|ter be ju&s;t touched upon. Some &s;hould &s;hine in a glare of light; others &s;hould be ca&s;t mode&s;tly into
<PB N="119" REF="138" MS="y">
the &s;hade. Some ought to be proclaimed by the &s;ound of trumpet; others there are, in which &s;ilence is the real eloquence.</P>
<P>If you would know how well Lord George Germain has employed all the&s;e &s;tyles (and this no &s;tyle) you mu&s;t con&s;ider the end and purpo&s;e for which (be&s;ides fame and immortality) a Secretary of State conde&s;cends to become an author.</P>
<P>The world at large is not aware of the real ob|ject of our war in America. The &s;ole drift and end of all our operations there, has hitherto been, neither more nor le&s;s, than to di&s;po&s;e of the &s;ums of money that have been rai&s;ed here. The&s;e have been va&s;t; and the di&s;per&s;ion of them has not been &s;o perfectly ea&s;y, as the common run of people might imagine. But, by the aid of our kind and di&s;intere&s;ted friends, (the London contractors, and the German Princes) the thing may be done. The facility however, of the expenditure, may not always facilitate the &s;upply. A great State&s;man, like other ingenious arti&s;ts, mu&s;t tickle the ear, whil&s;t he extracts the pur&s;e. The mob out of doors love a little good news, though it be at their own co&s;t. A victory is worth a million; and a good bonfire compen&s;ates a tax. The wi&s;e Mini&s;|ter (like the indu&s;trious ant) foreca&s;ts the winter, and prepares the mind for the ways and means of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, by the intelligence with which he en|tertains
<PB N="120" REF="139">
us during the rece&s;s. In the execution of this plan, he &s;trictly follows the great ma&s;ters of an|tiquity.</P>
<P>The polite critic of the Court of Augu&s;tus, Horace, was intended by that great Emperor (not &s;o happy in obtaining obedience to his commands as our Sovereign) for the office of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ab Epi&s;tolis.</NOTE> Secretary of State. Whil&s;t that bu&s;ine&s;s was in agitation, he wrote tho&s;e excellent rules for Gazettes, which have been unaccountably mi&s;taken for the rules of dramatic poetry. A gro&s;s error! for what has a Secretary of State to do with <HI>writing</HI> tragedies? Or how can we imagine that Horace, after com|manding a Roman legion, and di&s;tingui&s;hing him|&s;elf in war, &s;hould conde&s;cend to undertake the direction of the opera? The Gazette is the pro|per bu&s;ine&s;s of his department. Be&s;ides the ob|&s;ervations on &s;tyle that I have ju&s;t made, and which I confe&s;s I borrowed from this great judge, he makes &s;everal others of moment. He advi&s;es his Gazette writer to mix his fal&s;hood with &s;ome truth, <HI>ita mentitur</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>ut veris fal&s;a remi&s;cet.</HI> And he gives his rea&s;on, and a very &s;olid one,
<Q><L>Primo ne medium, medio ne di&s;crepat imum.</L></Q>
<PB N="121" REF="140">
He recommends it to them to put off, and to bring on matters, as may be&s;t &s;uit political purpo&s;es. <Q><L>Ut uunc dicat jam nunc debentia dici,</L>
<L>Pleraque differat, et pre&s;ens in tempus omittat.</L></Q>
But if facts prove &s;o very untractable, as by no art of mixture or procra&s;tination, to be made plea&s;ant, why then he thinks they are to be totally omitted.
<Q><L>&mdash;Quae</L>
<L>De&s;perat tractata nite&s;cere po&s;&s;e, relinquit.</L></Q></P>
<P>To exemplify in the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory manner his Lord&s;hip's &s;kill in conducting his Gazette upon the&s;e rules, the reader may remember the ample account we had of the exploits of Lord Dunmore. Not one captive piece was omitted of tho&s;e mi&s;er|able old cannon, which, until they were to <Q REND="inline">"open their mouths, and &s;hew forth his prai&s;e,"</Q> had &s;lept and ru&s;ted in neglect on the wharfs of Virgi|nia. All the pompous di&s;play of Livy and Cla|rendon, were employed to decorate the triumph of this favourite General. After this great and de|ci&s;ive advantage obtained by Lord Dunmore (as far as we could di&s;cover from the Gazette) we had nothing to do, but to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a di&s;armed Province. The gratitude of the nation was equal to the &s;ervices of the General. His Lord&s;hip was immortalized in the Gazette. He was adopted
<PB N="122" REF="141">
into the &s;acred &s;ixteen, levees, a&s;&s;emblies, coffee|hou&s;es, all agreed (and they were certainly right) that if every Governor had acted with the &s;pirit of Lord Dunmore, we mu&s;t have e&s;tabli&s;hed our do|minion in all the other Provinces, as perfectly as we had done in Virginia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Lord&s;hip had the honour of being the fir&s;t Governor who thought it nece&s;&s;ary to quit his government, and take re|fuge on board his Maje&s;ty's fleet. His Lord&s;hip at length aban|doned to the mercy of their ma&s;ters the wretched 62 negroes, that remained alive out of the 1500, whom his promi&s;es and proclamations had engaged to join the mini&s;terial part, and with a few people in a &s;tarved condition, fled his province.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all the joy that aro&s;e from &s;uch important victories as Lord Dunmore's, &s;o amply di&s;played, an odd &s;ort of an account arrived. A very brave officer, as brave and as intelli|gent an officer as any in the King's &s;ervice, Major Fordyce, with a detachment of our be&s;t grena|diers, was &s;ent by this heroic Commander Lord Dunmore, upon a well-planned expedition, to which there were but two &s;mall objections. One, that it was perfectly impracticable; the other, that if it did &s;ucceed, it could be of no kind of u&s;e. Accordingly Major Fordyce was killed. The party was defeated; all the grenadiers &s;lain or made pri&s;oners&mdash;What &s;aid the lately communi|cative Gazette? Not a &s;yllable. The Secretary of State had wa&s;ted his &s;tock of eloquence in his Panegyric on Lord Dunmore. He had nothing
<PB N="123" REF="142">
left for the funeral oration of Fordyce. He was as &s;ilent as the grave in which that gallant officer and his brave &s;oldiers were laid. And where was the nece&s;&s;ity for much di&s;cour&s;e? The man was dead; and what did it &s;ignify to put our&s;elves into an ill humour about what we could not po&s;|&s;ibly help.</P>
<P>This Virginian hi&s;tory is an in&s;tance of the dif|fu&s;ed &s;tile of the Gazette, contra&s;ted with the op|po&s;ite extreme of excellence,&mdash;the expre&s;&s;ive and eloquent &s;ilence. The in&s;tances of a le&s;s violent, but equally judicious contra&s;t, are frequent, and happily mixed in. I will endeavour to recall them to the reader's memory. Without &s;uch a retro&s;pect it will not be ea&s;y to enter into the true &s;pirit of this exqui&s;ite politico-literary performance, which is now the &s;ole &s;ource of authentic intelli|gence, and the only vehicle of our &s;ummer's de|light and information.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Gazette, December 23.</NOTE>When the forts of St. John and Chambl&eacute; were taken by the Provincials, and upwards of 500 regular troops made pri&s;oners, there was a demand for the compact, clo&s;e, laconic, &s;tyle. The Gazette did not altogether omit the&s;e events; but with a wonderful energy and brevity, related them in much fewer lines than the &s;horte&s;t article of the capitulation, by which tho&s;e unhappy troops
<PB N="124" REF="143">
had &s;urrendered pri&s;oners of war. Of cannon and &s;tores, not one word. The&s;e were left to the imagination of the reader. All accounts of the taking of cannon, in the explicit &s;tile, belonged, exclu&s;ively, to Lord Dunmore.</P>
<P>We may remember too, that when Arnold made the a&s;toni&s;hing march, which will for ever immortalize his name, the Gazette was not ab|&s;olutely &s;ilent. It gave to merit <HI>one hone&s;t line;</HI> and in the laconic brevity of Lord George Ger|main, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>one</HI> Arnold appeared at Point Levi<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Gazette, December 23.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Of the taking of Montreal, which place with the whole &s;trength of England and America con|joined, had formerly given glory and Peerage to Lord Amher&s;t&mdash;on the part of the Gazette SILENCE;&mdash;Col. Pre&s;cot, his &s;hips, his &s;oldiers, his &s;tores taken afterwards&mdash;SILENCE.</P>
<P>This uniformity of &s;ilence, however prudent, and even cha&s;tly eloquent, might &s;eem rather dull, and at length begin to di&s;gu&s;t. People might learn an ugly habit of looking el&s;ewhere for intelligence. In this di&s;tre&s;s an event hap|pened, which ju&s;tified the drawing up the flood|gate, and letting out all that flow of eloquence which had been &s;o long dammed in. <HI>Montgomery,</HI> an ob&s;cure man, of whom we had heard <HI>nothing</HI> before <HI>from authority,</HI> was killed at Quebec, and
<PB N="125" REF="144">
his troops repul&s;ed. But unfortunately, even on this faire&s;t of all occa&s;ions, we were again &s;adly at a lo&s;s. This happy opportunity was in danger of being wholly thrown away. The que&s;tion aro&s;e, where is the authority for this good news? The conquering General was too clo&s;ely blocked up, to &s;end a me&s;&s;enger of the deci&s;ive victory he had obtained. To take intelligence from the Philadelphia news papers, and to put at the foot of the account, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Charles Thomp&s;on,</HI>"</Q> (not our <HI>Sir</HI> Charles) and <Q REND="inline">"<HI>by order of the Congre&s;s,</HI>"</Q> was too much. In effect, it was to regi&s;ter a rebellious libel among the con&s;ecrated records of office. This was hard undoubtedly.</P>
<P>The difficulty &s;taggered the American Secretary of State. In an hurry a council is called. The Attorney General, in his firm, &s;turdy, direct way, objected to the mea&s;ure, He relied on it, that &s;uch a &s;tep might teach people to put &s;ome tru&s;t in rebellious publications; and would, be|&s;ides, totally take away the be&s;t, and &s;ometimes only excu&s;e we had for our prudent re&s;erve on mo&s;t of our defeats, viz. that we had them only from the narrative of the rebels. This had &s;ome weight. But Mr. Weddurburne, who&s;e <HI>forte</HI> is dexterity and refinement, ob&s;erved, that the Congre&s;s, as they are a raw, new government, and to that time unacquainted with di&s;graces, had
<PB N="126" REF="145">
not learned the art of glo&s;&s;ing a misfortune, but had delivered <Q REND="inline">"a plain round, unvarni&s;hed tale"</Q> of their defeat. This advantage is not to be mi&s;&s;ed. Here (&s;aid Mr. Wedderburne) we may di|late at the expence of an enemy. The narrative, as far as it goes, is their own; and our imagi|nation is at liberty to add full enough on this foun|dation. We cloath our&s;elves with the &s;poils of the enemy. We may dre&s;s our&s;elves <Q REND="inline">"<HI>&agrave; la Con|gr&egrave;&s;s.</HI>"</Q></P>

Lord George carried it for his friend the Solici|tor's opinion. The Philadelphia Congre&s;s Ga|zette &s;upplied the materials for our's; and here, (but at their expence) we expatiated again. The &s;tunted Gazette once more &s;hot out into a full luxuriance of narrative.</P>
<P>This mode, however, of borrowing an enemy's account is too tickli&s;h to be adopted as a regu|lar practice. Then came in the great delicate point in all human affairs, <Q REND="inline">"to know when to leave off."</Q> For, unluckily tho&s;e exotic Congre&s;s News-papers began to &s;hoot out &s;ome things that would not bear tran&s;planting, and were not at all adapted to flouri&s;h in the &s;oil of the London Ga|zette.

<P>The end of writing is <HI>et prode&s;&s;e et delectare.</HI> In a paper where the profit of Mini&s;ters, and the delight of the people, were to be the great objects, it would be a piece of downright ab&s;urdity to men|tion &s;uch things as cannot po&s;&s;ibly tell to the ad|vantage of the one of the parties, or afford any &s;ort of &s;atisfaction to either of them.</P>
<P>Mr. Miller, I find it impo&s;&s;ible to do ju&s;tice to the merits of Mini&s;ters, as Hi&s;torians of their own exploits, in a &s;ingle paper. The &s;ubject grows upon me, as the matter ri&s;es in dignity, and importance. Re&s;erving therefore the inimi|table

beauties of the Bo&s;ton narrative to another time, I &s;hall for the pre&s;ent &s;atisfy my&s;elf with re|marking, that the naval part of the war, though probably it comes from another quarter, is related on the &s;ame principle, and with no le&s;s perfection than that, which is carried on upon the <HI>Terra firma.</HI></P>
<P>One of our men of war returns home rather in a &s;habby condition. But what does &s;he come home for? In reality to bring the news of her own e&s;cape from the Americans. Since our af|fairs are in that plea&s;ant &s;ituation, that retreats are <HI>happy &s;hiftings of po&s;ition,</HI> and, that e&s;capes are to take rank as victories, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;play this eminent advantage at full length; and it is accordingly related at large in the true technical &s;tyle, and with all the elegant per&s;pi|cuity of the nautical dialect. The Gazette, &s;o lately on the re&s;erve, here becomes prodigal of information. We have, on the e&s;cape of the Gla&s;|gow (for the fir&s;t time) an account of Com|modore Hopkins's &s;quadron; the number of ve&s;|&s;els; the number of guns; the number of men; an account as exact as if we were furni&s;hed with it from the Navy Office of Philadelphia. The &s;tate of the Briti&s;h Navy was refu&s;ed on the motion of a Marine officer in Parliament, la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion. Amends are now made by a preci&s;e detail (given gratis) of one of the American Fleets. We have the &s;atis|faction
<PB N="129" REF="148">
to find that this navy is in &s;hoal water, (but &s;afe enough) in New England. In the late war, the e&s;cape of one of our &s;tout frigates, built and furni&s;hed for war, from a little &s;quadron, con|&s;i&s;ting of a decayed merchantman, with a &s;loop and &s;chooner or two, ha&s;tily and ill fitted into privateers, would &s;carce have de&s;erved a long laboured account in the Gazette. But things are altered; Mr. Pitt <HI>was,</HI> Lord George Germaine <HI>is,</HI> Secretary of State.</P>
<P>In this la&s;t piece we are furni&s;hed at one and the &s;ame time with a curious example of the various excellencies of the full di&s;play, and of the judi|cious re&s;erve. The Gazette, which knows &s;o minutely every gun in Hopkins's fleet, and its weight of metal, &s;ays nothing at all of this fellow's carrying his convoy, and the military &s;tores with which he was heavily laden, &s;afely to the place of their de&s;tination: Nor does it know, that he had taken a tran&s;port and tender in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. It even omits a piece of good fortune of the Gla&s;|gow, who&s;e &s;hot in the very fir&s;t broad&s;ide damag|ed Hopkins's rudder in &s;uch a manner, that his &s;hip lay for two hours incapable of pur&s;uit or fight.</P>
<P>To compleat this account of the American Re|gatta, made for our &s;pecial amu&s;ement; by the &s;ame u&s;e of light and &s;hade in the narrative, we are informed that a great number of &s;hips and
<PB N="130" REF="149">
<HI>ve&s;&s;els</HI> have been taken. By this judicious choice of terms, the number is as effectually &s;welled by the &s;eizure of a cock boat, as by the taking of the large&s;t &s;hip that ever &s;ailed in the Virginia trade.</P>
<P>As to captures made on the part of the Ameri|cans, we might conclude from the prudent &s;ilence of the Gazette, that there were ab&s;olutely none. If it were not for an impertinent tell-tale in the city, called Lloyd's Li&s;t, (who, in all good policy ought to be &s;ilenced) we &s;hould never have gue&s;&s;ed that above FIFTY tran&s;port &s;hips had been taken by the Americans; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The number has &s;ince been very much increa&s;ed, the Portugal trade has &s;uffered not a little, and the Newfound|land trade has not e&s;caped; the&s;e rebellious privateers take our &s;hips upon our own coa&s;t.</NOTE> the &s;hips them&s;elves, ex|clu&s;ive of the cargoes, of as much value at lea&s;t as the whole of the prizes taken from the Ameri|cans.</P>
<P>In a word, whether by land or &s;ea, we are &s;carcely intitled from <HI>authority</HI> to believe, that one misfortune has happened in the whole war. All is Glory, Succe&s;s, and Victory. Yet Thirteen Provinces are lo&s;t.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day, July 11, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MR. MILLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE emi&s;&s;ion of authori&s;ed news-papers is an homage paid by the mo&s;t de&s;potic powers to public opinion. By the &s;ending abroad Gazettes, they tacitly, but fully admit two very material points. Fir&s;t. the right of the people to be informed of the &s;tate of national affairs. Se|condly, the influence of popular judgement on their own fortune. They know it would be an enterpri&s;e too de&s;perate, to think of keeping the people wholly in the dark.</P>
<P>We are apt to entertain rather too mean an opi|nion of the &s;pirit and under&s;tanding of our neigh|bours. There is not a nation in Europe &s;o &s;er|vilely pa&s;&s;ive, as to abandon all concern about its own welfare; and to give a credit ab&s;olutely un|limited
<PB N="132" REF="151" MS="y">
to its admini&s;tration. It is true, that the people under de&s;potic governments, have it not in their power to take a <HI>legal</HI> vengeance on tho&s;e who abu&s;e their tru&s;t, or to remove tho&s;e who &s;hew them&s;elves unequal to it. This is the grand defect of their &s;cheme of government. But na|ture &s;ometimes &s;upplies the place of law, and their illegal &s;en&s;ibility frequently takes a &s;evere vengeance on tho&s;e, who confiding in the weak|ne&s;s and imperfection of the con&s;titution of their country, pre&s;ume to act in violation of the &s;pirit of all laws. Even when &s;uch a people are not able to puni&s;h an un&s;kilful &s;tate actor, their voice is generally &s;ufficient to explode, and hi&s;s him from the public &s;tage.</P>
<P>We have &s;een not long ago, that the &s;ame King of Spain, who with an high hand protected, pro|moted, honoured, and rewarded Don Franci&s;co Bucarelli, although he was impeached of high crimes and mi&s;demeanors, even from the throne of Great Britain it&s;elf, was obliged to di&s;mi&s;s and bani&s;h the Marquis of Squillace, his Favourite and Prime Mini&s;ter, to appea&s;e the di&s;contents of the people of Madrid. The &s;ame King was but the other day obliged, on account of the di&s;plea|&s;ure of his &s;ubjects, to di&s;mi&s;s and remove from Court the Cond&eacute; O'Reilly, a Mini&s;ter and a
<PB N="133" REF="152" MS="y">
General high in his favour, upon his failure in an enterprize again&s;t Algiers.</P>
<P>The King of France, on the di&s;content of a part of his people, and the ill &s;ucce&s;s of &s;ome financial projects, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, Mon&s;ieur Turgot, as he had rai&s;ed that Mini&s;ter, to gratify the opinion of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters in other countries finding them&s;elves obliged to humble their pride before their nece&s;|&s;ities, do not venture to keep all information from the people. On the contrary, they affect to &s;up|ply them with it very liberally, and very hone&s;tly. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the only &s;ource of authentic intelli|gence, they indeed glo&s;s and varni&s;h, but never attempt gro&s;ly to mi&s;repre&s;ent, much le&s;s wholly to conceal. Even at Con&s;tantinople, the Mini&s;ter &s;tands in awe of public opinion. Not having a pre&s;s there, the government keeps in its pay a &s;et of walking Gazettes (&s;omewhat like our Court runners) who mount on a &s;tool in Coffee-hou&s;es, and entertain their grave turban'd hearers with an account of the de&s;igns of the Court of Peter&s;burgh, or the progre&s;s of the rebellion in Egypt.</P>
<P>As a nation declining from greatne&s;s is the mo&s;t mean, and a people &s;inking from freedom are the mo&s;t eminently &s;ervile, our Mini&s;ters think this is a fit &s;ea&s;on for an experiment, to find out the <HI>maximum</HI> of human patience, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and
<PB N="134" REF="153">
pa&s;&s;ive-obedience. Their proceedings in the Ga|zette, with regard to the late war in New-Eng|land, &s;hew what progre&s;s they have made in that experiment.</P>
<P>From the begining of our pre&s;ent troubles, our hopes and fears were all engaged at Bo&s;ton. This was the heart and vital &s;pring of all di&s;order. It was not &s;o much the metropolis of America, as the head-quarters of rebellion. Bo&s;ton accord|ingly became the object of all our civil regula|tions for &s;everal &s;e&s;&s;ions, and of all our mili|tary operations for two years together. Our eyes were never a moment turned from it. Expecta|tion panted on every We&s;tern breeze&mdash;when the Gazette &s;uddenly announced to a longing and anxious people, that General Howe had <HI>taken a re&s;olution</HI> to evacuate Bo&s;ton, and was actually on his way to Halifax. Habituated as we are to every thing extraordinary, the ea&s;y brevity of this account did excite &s;ome degree of &s;urpri&s;e. There was nothing in it which could give you the lea&s;t idea of war, or warlike operations. It was deli|vered with as ea&s;y and carele&s;s an air, as if the &s;tory was nothing more than that a corps had changed their country quarters; ju&s;t as if General Howe's regiment had &s;hifted their quarters from Bo&s;ton in Lincoln&s;hire, to Halifax in York&s;hire. And this is all the &s;atisfaction that the nation has ever
<PB N="135" REF="154" MS="y">
yet received for &s;ix millions expended, and the la&s;t town in thirteen Provinces lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Lord George Germain's experiment on the temper of the people of England was made, and it an&s;wered. This proud and jealous nation bore that treatment with a patience, that would have &s;hamed the hired credulity of contented cuck|oldom. Tho&s;e who would have impo&s;ed Ovid's Metamorpho&s;es for articles of faith, never pre|&s;umed &s;o much upon the weakne&s;s of the human under&s;tanding. A more perfect pa&s;&s;ive-obedience was never preached by intere&s;ted prie&s;ts, for the practice of the credulous laity. A Turk, blinded with the &s;moke of tobacco, and dozed with opium, would have pu&s;hed his live Gazette from his &s;tool, and kicked him out of the Coffee-hou&s;e, if he had dared to give this account of the evacuation of Ockzakow or Bender. Even the foreign Ga|zettes, &s;killed and practi&s;ed as they are in the trade and my&s;tery of intelligence, &s;tood in a&s;to|ni&s;hment at the bold pu&s;h of their dear brother of Whitehall; and publicly avowed their amaze|ment at this new political phaenomenon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Hague Gazette.</NOTE></P>
<P>That noble and venerable body, in which a Mini&s;ter of State<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Earl of Sandwich, the Fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty.</NOTE> lately boa&s;ted that he had con|cealed from them, and from his own colleagues,
<PB N="136" REF="155" MS="y">
the true &s;tate of their affairs, le&s;t they &s;hould be &s;low in entering into a civil war, they of cour&s;e de&s;ired to know nothing. They looked on the proceedings of their Mini&s;ter, as on the feats of Mr. Bre&s;law, in which a knowledge of the &s;light would only &s;poil their plea&s;ure in the deception. Both Hou&s;es are coolly and deliberately acting their part in this great work. Declaring them|&s;elves totally indifferent about every part of pub|lic duty, and even de&s;titute of common human feelings, they are preparing to make their coun|try as indifferent about the exi&s;tence of Parliament it&s;elf. Several worthy and diligent Members al|ready &s;hew them&s;elves heartily tired of parliamen|tary attendance. They imagine, that with <HI>their</HI> talents they might <HI>get</HI> as much under any other form of government as under this, with an at|tendance le&s;s fatiguing, and a far lighter expence. They think a Mini&s;ter's levee room, has as whole|&s;ome an air as St. Stephen's chapel; and that the dome&s;tics of a Court Favourite, are a cheaper ob|ject of bribery, and full as worthy an object of adulation, as the &s;cot and lot of a venal borough. Perhaps they may be in the right.</P>
<P>On occa&s;ion of this real <HI>Gazette Extraordinary,</HI> the Earl of Suffolk, one of his Maje&s;ty's princi|pal Secretaries of State, di&s;covered &s;ome marks of good breeding; though he does not come quite
<PB N="137" REF="156" MS="y">
up to all the graces which Lord Che&s;terfield re|quires as qualifications to office. He has, I &s;up|po&s;e, &s;ome remains of complai&s;ance to that mino|rity, in which he made &s;o flaming a prote&s;t again&s;t his pre&s;ent a&s;&s;ociates. In conde&s;cen&s;ion to the weakne&s;s of the Lords in oppo&s;ition, he &s;ubmitted to tell them the rea&s;on why he told them nothing. He lamented in the mo&s;t pathetic &s;trains to his noble audience, the nece&s;&s;ity he was under of not producing any part of General Howe's letter; for (he &s;aid) "the account of the retreat was &s;o mixed with matters that went before, and operations which were to follow after (very improper to be publicly known) that he could not po&s;&s;ibly di&s;en|tangle them; and that thus he was di&s;abled from doing ju&s;tice to the incomparable merits of the General, who had made &s;o happy <Q REND="inline">"<HI>a &s;hifting of po|&s;ition.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>Every thing has its place, and in the Hou&s;e of Lords <HI>this</HI> gave &s;atisfaction. We the rabble be|low the bar, however, thought it odd; that what had pa&s;&s;ed <HI>before</HI> General Howe's retreat &s;hould be concealed from us, &s;ince it could never have been concealed from the enemy. Perhaps what went <HI>before,</HI> might be the cau&s;e of the retreat that followed <HI>after.</HI> If indeed this preceding cau&s;e &s;hould con&s;i&s;t in &s;ome batteries too fierce to be borne, and too &s;trong to be forced, this I admit
<PB N="138" REF="157">
was a good rea&s;on for concealment. We ought not to know that the rebels have any cannon &s;ince Lord Dunmore &s;eized all their artillery; or that they know how to erect batteries, or that they have courage to defend them.</P>
<P>The other part of the rea&s;on for concealing the account of General Howe's retreat, I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, is not quite &s;o honourable to the clearne&s;s of head of that General, or demon|&s;trates &s;o fully as one could wi&s;h, the calm &s;itua|tion of one who makes an undi&s;turbed retreat. So perplexed and involved (if we believe Lord Suffolk) was General Howe's account, that the Secretary of State's office, in full practice of gar|bling papers for the diver&s;ion of Parliament, was not able to unravel the complicated texture of the commentaries of our American Cae&s;ar, or to give one particular of his proceedings for &s;everal months to the hour of his departure, without di&s;clo&s;ing all the &s;ecrets of the coming campaign.</P>
<P>With all due deference to my Lord Suffolk, I do not believe &s;o ill of the abilities either of Ge|neral Howe, or of his Lord&s;hip. I can never be|lieve the alledged confu&s;ion of General Howe's ideas, to be the real rea&s;on for concealing from us every &s;ingle circum&s;tance of his precipitate de|reliction of the precious purcha&s;e of millions. His Lord&s;hip told the Peers, that this confu&s;ion di&s;|abled
<PB N="139" REF="158">
him from doing ju&s;tice to General Howe's merits. Under favour there was no que&s;tion of that General's merits. We are very &s;ure that <HI>He</HI> did his duty, and that He gave an account of it naturally and clearly. This concealment was ne|ver for his &s;ake, or the &s;ake of his operations. But for whatever purpo&s;e this account of Lord Suffolk's was given, it could an&s;wer no rational end. If we could believe this account, the friends of the war would be obliged to entertain but gloomy hopes of its future &s;ucce&s;s. Partial as they are to the authors of civil contention, they mu&s;t condemn the Mini&s;ter for committing the fortune of their pious quarrel into &s;uch hands. To admit their plea in the ju&s;tification of their Gazette, is to find a verdict again&s;t the wi&s;dom of their Cabinet.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had that Gazette notified to us that General Howe had <HI>taken this re&s;olution,</HI> than we were entertained with verbal comments upon it, more curious than the original text. The Mini|&s;try a&s;&s;umed a face of joy equal to that which would have attended the mo&s;t deci&s;ive victory. As &s;oon as Bo&s;ton was evacuated, Bo&s;ton at once changed its nature. It no longer &s;tood under the &s;ame parallel of latitude. It then became the wor&s;t cho&s;en &s;pot on the whole continent for the operations of war. We were too happy in getting
<PB N="140" REF="159">
rid of it. The Americans were anew charged with cowardice for letting us e&s;cape. The Lords publicly congratulated each other on having &s;haken off &s;o intolerable a yoke.</P>
<P>In this exultation they forgot one trifling cir|cum&s;tance, which &s;omewhat regards their credit for the pre&s;ent; and may perhaps a little affect their &s;afety on &s;ome future day of account. Sup|po&s;e a &s;pirit of enquiry &s;hould ari&s;e, and it &s;hould be a&s;ked, who were they who brought his Ma|je&s;ty's army into a place from whence it was a tri|umph to e&s;cape? If Bo&s;ton was not a &s;pot worth holding for its own &s;ake, or for its convenience for other operations, why did the troops continue there for near two years? Why were they rein|forced day after day, and regiment after regiment, for the defence of that place, until they amount|ed to upwards of 12,000 men? Why were four Generals &s;ent to command them? Why was the Ordnance Office emptied to defend Bo&s;ton? Why was the &s;inking fund &s;wallowed up, only by its military <HI>extraordinaries,</HI> which amounted to up|wards of 850,000l.? Why were 60,000 ton of tran&s;ports employed in that &s;ervice? Why was this nation almo&s;t &s;tarved to feed that town? Why was a fleet commanded by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Briti&s;h Admirals, and at an incredible expence &s;tationed in its harbour? Why was &s;o much brave blood &s;hed
<PB N="141" REF="160">
at Bunker's-Hill to prevent its being in&s;ulted? Every &s;hilling &s;pent at Bo&s;ton is a peculation of public money; every life lo&s;t there is a cruel murder, if Bo&s;ton was not a place worth pre&s;erv|ing. To exhau&s;t your&s;elf in defence of an object that is not worth having, or not to take &s;ufficient means of defending an object of real value, are both of them crimes. If there be any difference, the fir&s;t crime is the wor&s;t; as it is wor&s;e wholly to mi&s;take the end, than to mi&s;calculate the means. It is, however, for this capital blunder, that the Mini&s;ters claim the applau&s;es of their country. According to this rule, the merit of our Generals is to e&s;cape from the place where the providence of our Mini&s;ters had &s;tationed them; no hopes are entertained by them&s;elves of the war, if all its plans are not wholly rever&s;ed in the exe|cution.</P>
<P>Such is the ca&s;e on their own repre&s;entation, which is wor&s;e than the mo&s;t malignant adver&s;ary could have &s;tated it. But as they are poor in coun&s;el, the Court mu&s;t not record the plea. General Howe did not abandon Bo&s;ton, becau&s;e it was a place ill fitted, and never went to Hali|fax, becau&s;e it was a place well fitted for a center of military operations. The Mini&s;ters of the Ga|zette &s;uppo&s;e we know nothing of American geo|graphy, when we are told that in order to direct
<PB N="142" REF="161" MS="y">
his operations on the <HI>middle</HI> colonies, General Howe fled to the very extremity of the <HI>northern.</HI> It is neither more nor le&s;s than to tell us, that a General in London, who intended to attack Do|ver Ca&s;tle, would find it his be&s;t way thither to march his troops from hence to Edinburgh.</P>
<P>I was at fir&s;t at a lo&s;s to know how the Mini&s;try could give into this apparently in&s;olent and un|feeling di&s;cour&s;e. How they could think to glory in their &s;hame, and to defend them&s;elves by the very circum&s;tances which aggravate their offence. But on putting things together, it may be ac|counted for. It was to prepare the minds of the people for the events which in &s;pite of any favour of fortune, mu&s;t inevitably follow from the cour&s;e they have pur&s;ued. They have told the public that Bo&s;ton was worth nothing, becau&s;e they were not able to keep it, and had no hopes of recover|ing it. If they find that the nation can be per|&s;uaded to make violent efforts, on a &s;uppo&s;ition of the value of the object, and then to take com|fort on their failure, from a con&s;ideration of its in&s;ignificance, all they wi&s;h is effected. They have already, by many &s;peeches and publications con|cerning the Colonies, been preparing the public for the lo&s;s of the whole. They are already &s;preading with infinite diligence, an opinion that exten&s;ive empire is mi&s;chievous, and that the va&s;t acqui&s;i|tions
<PB N="143" REF="162" MS="y">
in the ea&s;t and we&s;t corrupt our minds, and weaken our indu&s;try.</P>
<P>This is the con&s;olation they hoard up for us again&s;t the day of our bitter di&s;tre&s;s, when we &s;hall have undone our&s;elves in an attempt to ruin our countrymen. Stripped of her dependencies, the nakedne&s;s of England is to be covered with the tattered cloak of a compelled, beggarly, Cynic philo&s;ophy. The lo&s;s of glory and dominion are to be compen&s;ated by dull, common-place ob&s;er|vations on the in&s;tability of empire, and the emp|tine&s;s of all human honours. Our Mini&s;ters of State are preparing them&s;elves to become mini&s;ters of the church, and to preach patience and re&s;igna|tion to a tractable auditory, reduced at length to a real Chri&s;tian humility, and to a true po|verty of pur&s;e and of &s;pirit, by the &s;alutary oper|ation of their councils.</P>
<P>Hitherto they have done every thing to bring us to the &s;tate for which they are preparing us. But if the events of war &s;hould belye their plans; and if the bravery of General Hei&s;ter and his He&s;&s;ian troops, &s;hould recover what Briti&s;h valour (under the direction of our Mini&s;ters) could not keep, it is then that in their &s;ucce&s;s the mi&s;chief and weak|ne&s;s of their plans will appear in full lu&s;tre. The &s;un&s;hine of fortune will only di&s;play, in a glare of light, the inanity of the object for which the Mini&s;try and their German troops are contending.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="163">
The Colonies, in all the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of di&s;a&s;ter and defeat, will prove full as unfruitful of the revenue for which we are at war, and which alone can pay for that war, as the &s;ame colonies in all the heighth and in&s;olence of &s;ucce&s;sful re&s;i&s;tance. Then it will appear that the Mini&s;try and their runners were not idly employed when they told us the Colonies are of no advantage to this country. This will be the event when Lord George Sackville's Gazette &s;hall have &s;atiated us with the pompous narrative of the victories obtained by the troops of the Duke of Brun&s;wick (di&s;ciplined by Prince Ferdi|nand) over the mi&s;erable Engli&s;h on the other &s;ide of the water.</P>
<P>Until that glorious day, announced with &s;uch &s;ingular propriety, arrives, when the Gazette &s;hall flow in as copious &s;treams as the We&s;er or the Elbe, its &s;canty current continues to be directed &s;o as to fructify the proper plants, and to &s;tarve the re&s;t. In my la&s;t paper I remarked on the man|ner in which the Secretary's Office communicates and witholds intelligence. They profit of my prai&s;es; and &s;o encouraged, they per&s;evere reli|giou&s;ly in the plan, for which I had commended them.</P>
<P>In the Gazette of the 29th of la&s;t month, Lord George copies the be&s;t of examples, him|&s;elf. In the la&s;t war the captures of merchant
<PB N="145" REF="164" MS="y">
&s;hips was never the food of the Gazette.

<HEAD>PROSPECT from SUCCESS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Tue&s;day, Nov. 5, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MR. MILLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now the third winter &s;ince the commence|ment of the pre&s;ent natural and au&s;picious war again&s;t our Colonies. It is, I think, &s;o long &s;ince General Gage was &s;ent to Bo&s;ton with a fleet and army, together with a heavy train of artillery, formed of the well-tempered metal of tho&s;e &s;ound Acts of Parliament, which were to bat|ter down all re&s;i&s;tance to the authority of Briti&s;h Government. For the greate&s;t part of that period our expences were continually on the increa&s;e, and our hopes continually on the wane. At length news arrives, as unexpected as it is &s;atisfactory;&mdash;that 25,000 He&s;&s;ian and Briti&s;h troops, with the aid of a &s;quadron of men of war,
<PB N="148" REF="167">
had &s;urpri&s;ed 7000 Provincials out of their in|trenchments, turned their flanks, and thrown them into confu&s;ion; on which their lines are abandoned, and the city of New-York left ex|po&s;ed and untenable.</P>
<P>This news arrives in the very nick of time, as if it had been be&s;poke. It is done to a turn. It came ju&s;t at the meeting of Parliament. With|out it Mini&s;try had been &s;adly at a lo&s;s. With|out this victory, the expul&s;ion from Bo&s;ton, the repul&s;e at Charles-Town, and the petty defeats in almo&s;t every creek and harbour of North-America, together with the capture of &s;o many valuable merchantmen in the &s;eas of the We&s;t-Indies, and even of Europe, would have fur|ni&s;hed more &s;uitable matter for an impeachment of Mini&s;ters, than a &s;peech from the throne.</P>
<P>I have heard, that as this news did not arrive early in the &s;ea&s;on, the &s;peech, as fir&s;t prepared, was (as in rea&s;on, it ought) written in a very dif|ferent &s;tyle from the pre&s;ent. The expre&s;&s;ions were at lea&s;t as gracious to the Engli&s;h &s;ubject here; and the epithets not nearly &s;o high &s;ea|&s;oned with regard to tho&s;e on the other &s;ide of the great water. There was not a word of trea|&s;on in it. It expre&s;&s;ed, according to report, <HI>&s;ome</HI> di&s;po&s;ition to concede and reconcile, of which this &s;peech &s;hews no &s;igns at all. But on the whole,
<PB N="149" REF="168">
it was as fine a performance in the tender and pa|thetic &s;tyle, as the pre&s;ent is in the grand and lofty. It is a pity we are not favoured with the fir&s;t &s;ketch; for Mini&s;ters, like poets,
<Q><L>&mdash;Lo&s;e half the prai&s;e they would have got,</L>
<L>Were it but known what they di&s;crectly blot.</L></Q></P>
<P>Victory has deprived us for ever of that fine compo&s;ition. It has, however, made full amends. This victory, and the effect of it, is mo&s;t happily and ably de&s;cribed in the pre&s;ent (not eva&s;ive and hypocritical) but clear and ingenuous, as well as mo&s;t gracious, humane, and merciful oration. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The &s;ucce&s;s in that province (&s;ays the &s;peech) has been &s;o <HI>important,</HI> as to give <HI>the &s;tronge&s;t hopes</HI> of the <HI>mo&s;t deci&s;ive good con&s;equences.</HI>"</Q> I &s;uppo&s;e the royal and noble authors of this fini&s;hed performance, are &s;o intent on enforcing the laws of the land, that they quite forget tho&s;e of grammar; and are &s;o eager about breaking &s;tubborn heads, that in their hurry they mi&s;take Pri&s;cian for Yankee. I therefore make no remarks on the con&s;truction of this &s;entence. I am carried away by the higher beauties of the performance. I am &s;en&s;ible that it was fa&s;hioned on the principles of the &s;ciences now in the greate&s;t e&s;timation. Writers have done much for gardening. Gar|dening again has paid its tribute to literary com|po&s;ition.
<PB N="150" REF="169">
This rural &s;cience even Kings do not di&s;dain to cultivate. One of the leading prin|ciples in this modi&s;h gardening, is, as Pope ex|pre&s;&s;es it, <Q REND="inline">"Decently to hide."</Q> All mu&s;t not come upon us at once. We are to be on the very edge of the &s;kulking <HI>haha,</HI> and ready to tumble into it, before we are to be put on our guard. This the rules of the art require; and the principle is tran&s;planted into the &s;peech. Had that &s;peech bluntly and plainly told us, that the action was deci&s;ive, the terms would be well enough under&s;tood; that is, deci&s;ive of the for|tune of war; but then (ob&s;erve the judgment) the main point would be lo&s;t. For we &s;hould im|mediately begin to think of enjoying the revenue of the conquered country, and of &s;ome &s;ort of oeconomy in regard to our own. On the other hand, had the Mini&s;try, who are equally com|municative through their goodne&s;s, and re&s;erved through their wi&s;dom, held out no hopes at all of an end to that bu&s;ine&s;s, this nation would hardly be per&s;uaded to go on this journey with her u&s;ual alacrity. But here we have a new phra&s;e to ex|pre&s;s a new &s;ituation.&mdash;What <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>an hope of deci|&s;ive good con&s;equences</HI>"</Q> means, I do not per|fectly under&s;tand; though the words are brave words, and certainly very plea&s;ing; becau&s;e hope,
<PB N="151" REF="170">
deci&s;ion, and good con&s;equences, are always agreeable &s;ounds to well-tuned ears, let them be placed or connected in what manner they may. What the good con&s;equences are&mdash;when they will probably happen&mdash;from whence they are to ari&s;e&mdash;or how far they are to extend, we know not. All this lies wrapt in clouds and darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>But for this ob&s;curity we are &s;oon made ample amends, and the whole is cleared up in the next &s;entence. We lo&s;t &s;ight of the building in the mazes of the &s;erpentine walk; but we catch it again in a very agreeable manner; it breaks in upon us with double effect. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But notwith&s;tand|ing this <HI>fair pro&s;pect,</HI> (&s;ays the &s;peech) we mu&s;t at all events prepare for <HI>another</HI> campaign."</Q></P>
<P>Thus the riddle of the <Q REND="inline">"<HI>deci&s;ive good con&s;e|quences</HI>"</Q> is &s;olved. It &s;ignifies neither more nor le&s;s than this; that we are in an happy train of &s;pending twenty millions this year in addi|tion to the fifteen millions which we &s;pent in the la&s;t. I heartily congratulate the Mini&s;try and my country on tho&s;e <HI>&s;trong hopes,</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>deci|&s;ive good con&s;equences.</HI> If defeat entitled us to &s;pend fifteen millions, it is certainly rea&s;onable that victory, as it is more worth, &s;hould be more expen&s;ive. This is indeed at length di&s;tinctly promi&s;ed, though in terms rather unu&s;ual; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>This important con&s;ideration</HI> will nece&s;&s;arily be
<PB N="152" REF="171">
followed with <HI>great expence.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;With &s;ubmi&s;+&s;ion, I fear, that all the <HI>great expence</HI> incurred and likely to be incurred, has ari&s;en from <HI>want</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The next paragraph of the &s;peech is full of hopes too. It has likewi&s;e its windings and mazes. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The a&s;&s;urances of amity from the &s;everal Courts of Europe"</Q> are not (it &s;eems) now for the fir&s;t time given,&mdash;but his Maje&s;ty <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>continues</HI> to receive them."</Q> You would naturally ex|pect, in con&s;equence of this uniformity of faith|ful a&s;&s;urances, that his Maje&s;ty's mind &s;till re&s;ted in the &s;ame perfect repo&s;e it has hitherto enjoyed on that &s;oft cu&s;hion of &s;tate from the beginning of the&s;e troubles. From the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, nobody living, I am per&s;uaded, could expect the conclu|&s;ion, which comes on you like a &s;troke of thun|der, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>that it is expedient in the</HI> pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, <HI>that we &s;hould be in a re&s;pectable</HI> &s;tate of defence at home."</Q></P>
<P>It &s;eems then, that the effect of <HI>royal</HI> a&s;&s;ur|ances (I mean from abroad) is to le&s;&s;en confidence in the direct ratio of their continuance. When I read this, I was immediately put in mind of the good old adage
<Q><L>"Multa levant promi&s;&s;a fidem,"</L></Q>
Which I never &s;aw &s;o thoroughly exemplified be|fore.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="172">
In this part of the &s;peech we di&s;cover a &s;econd point, perfectly worthy the congratulations which our gracious Sovereign has conde&s;cended to make to his obedient people; namely,&mdash;that we are likely to have a Spani&s;h and French war to en|liven the dull uniformity of our civil di&s;&s;entions."</P>
<P>Such an event we were told la&s;t year was ab&s;o|lutely impo&s;&s;ible; and what is very remarkable, it was expre&s;sly &s;aid to be impo&s;&s;ible, <HI>then,</HI> for the very rea&s;ons given for apprehending it in the &s;peech of this year; that is, from the tendency of the &s;ucce&s;s of America to un&s;ettle the <HI>&s;y&s;tem of Europe.</HI> If I perfectly under&s;tand the expre&s;&s;ion in the &s;peech, it means, that the &s;ucce&s;s of the Americans would encourage the colonies of other nations, to rebel. Our rulers therefore (la&s;t year) concluded it impo&s;&s;ible that tho&s;e nations &s;hould give them encouragement. Be this as it may, we know that the impo&s;&s;ibility of la&s;t year on the principles a&s;&s;igned in the &s;peech of this year, has already co&s;t to our con&s;titution two illegal embar|goes; to our credit an heavy fall of &s;tock; and to our finances it will be immediately followed by an augmentation of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Only 17,000 for the pre&s;ent.</NOTE> 20,000 &s;eamen; a call of the militia; an increa&s;e of the &s;tanding army. The&s;e are &s;ome of the <HI>deci&s;ive good con&s;equences</HI> of "<HI>con|tinuing to receive a&s;&s;urances of</HI> amity from the &s;everal foreign Courts; and of a favourite and po|pular
<PB N="154" REF="173">
civil war; in which po&s;&s;ibility and impo&s;&s;i|bility, hope and fear, lo&s;s or gain, victory and defeat, all alike, as rays from every part of a va&s;t circumference, tend to a common centre, meeting in this one point&mdash;Public Bank|ruptcy.</P>
<P>I believe that tho&s;e who have addre&s;&s;ed &s;o duti|fully, and prayed &s;o charitably for the ble&s;&s;ing of an American war, hardly in&s;i&s;ted on this Euro|pean war into the bargain; even with all its <HI>de|ci&s;ive good con&s;equences.</HI> But a gracious and bountiful Mini&s;try always gives heaped mea&s;ure. Perhaps the addre&s;&s;ers, though they &s;o chearfully voted lives and fortunes, did not ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;t upon giving near a million &s;terling of their trad|ing property, in order to nur&s;e to maturity the infant naval power of the Colonies; though <HI>after</HI> the lo&s;s, the captures have, I admit, given the Admiralty an opportunity of di&s;playing its vigi|lance and <HI>&s;ore&s;ight</HI> in providing convoys. An|other advantage, not within the &s;tipulation, and which is given to the addre&s;&s;ers of free grace and bounty, is the ri&s;e of in&s;urance on the trade! which amounts to a prodigious &s;um; and is there|fore, to all intents and purpo&s;es, a <HI>tax</HI> to that amount on the commercial property of England.</P>
<P>I do not know whether the &s;laughters that have been made and &s;uffered in many parts of Ame|rica; and the burthens which have been impo&s;ed,
<PB N="155" REF="174" MS="y">
or are in a cour&s;e of being impo&s;ed at home, are &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy us. I remember it was the language of la&s;t year, in excu&s;e for not offering terms to North America, that we could not make peace with dignity until we had given our colo|nies &s;ome heavy blow. Is not this blow of New-York heavy enough for our dignity? We have al|ready &s;acrificed many millions of our own trea|&s;ure, a good many lives of the <HI>in&s;ular Engli&s;h,</HI> and at one &s;troke about 3000 of the <HI>Continental Engli&s;h</HI> to that fierce Court-God, Dignity. Is the &s;ea&s;on not yet arrived when we are to give &s;ome attention to that humble, hou&s;hold God, <HI>Self-Intere&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>But we are, <Q REND="inline">"at all events, to prepare for <HI>another</HI> campaign."</Q> We do not quite forget, that when 50,000 regular troops, and an hundred &s;hips of force, and &s;uch an artillery as never was employed in any foreign war, were &s;ent la&s;t year to America, all this va&s;t power and expence was &s;aid to be employed in order to prevent ho&s;tilities from being drawn out into length, and to fini&s;h the war in <HI>another</HI> campaign. But that <HI>&s;econd ano|ther</HI> is, we &s;ee, to produce <HI>a third another;</HI> and thus, as our poet &s;ays,<Q><L>"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow</L>
<L>"Creeps on his petty pace from day to day,</L>
<L>"To the la&s;t &s;yllable of recorded time,</L>
<L><PB N="156" REF="175">
"And all our ye&s;terdays have lighted fools</L>
<L>"The way to du&s;ty death."</L></Q></P>
<P>And thus &s;hall we war on, till after irreparable injuries done and received, we &s;hall, from mere wearine&s;s and fatigue, fall back to the mi&s;erable, vexatious, and precarious &s;tate of peace without reconciliation.</P>
<P>I will &s;uppo&s;e America <HI>laid at Lord North's feet,</HI> and reduced to Lord George Germaine's <Q REND="inline">"<HI>unconditioned &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,</HI>"</Q> yet without the formal e&s;tabli&s;hment of liberty to &s;atisfy and content, or the formal e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;lavery in its in&s;tru|ment a mercenary army, to awe and terrify, do you &s;eriou&s;ly, my countrymen, Whigs or Tories, as you may be, do you &s;eriou&s;ly expect a continu|ance of obedience?</P>
<P>There has been a great victory at Long I&s;land. Many Engli&s;h were butchered by the He&s;&s;ians after they had laid down their arms. This, it &s;eems, was proper, and was ju&s;tified by the law of arms, and &s;hews that a rabble of freemen are not to trifle with He&s;&s;ian &s;pirit and re&s;entment. Col. Balfour has brought an account of the tak|ing of the uninhabited walls of New York, which were &s;natched, half burnt, from the fire. Has he brought any account of any thing like a move|ment towards a general &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in all the Co|lonies? or even in any one of them? Very far
<PB N="157" REF="176">
from it. The He&s;&s;ians mu&s;t, ju&s;tifiably, &s;laughter more men in cold blood; your people mu&s;t aban|don, and in de&s;pair burn more of their towns; there mu&s;t be more mutual rapine of the pro|perty of Engli&s;h on Engli&s;h: Thus we mu&s;t go on&mdash;For what? To e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;tanding army in America for our ruin, in order to furni&s;h Com|mi&s;&s;ions to the younger Adelphi of antient decayed Northern Families. It can be for nothing el&s;e; for I do not believe that any one man living has the folly to imagine that all the taxes to be drawn from America for a century together, will even pay for the repair of New York, &s;o as to fit it, for its only purpo&s;e, a barrack for General Hei&s;ter's and General Howe's army.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e in &s;hort is this. Our war for taxa|tion, in America, has not yet, and never will produce a revenue. <HI>America is not taxed</HI>&mdash;but <HI>England is.</HI> America is impoveri&s;hed, undone if you plea&s;e, but England is not enriched. The Colonies have now avowed independence. I have ever &s;aid, and I think &s;hewn in my former let|ters, that it was in no &s;ort their original inten|tion in this conte&s;t; but that they would infalli|bly be driven to it by the mea&s;ures of violence hotly and ob&s;tinately pur&s;ued, and by the rejec|tion with the &s;ame intemperate pertinacity, of every means of reconciliation. But one phra&s;e
<PB N="158" REF="177">
&s;erves for all rea&s;ons. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They have avowed in|dependency."</Q> They have &s;o; and is it be|cau&s;e America has avowed independency, that England mu&s;t be ruined? can we be quite certain that the offer of terms of liberty, which will co&s;t us nothing, will not draw them from that inde|pendency; when we are &s;ure, that offers of &s;la|very, which have co&s;t us millions, have driven them to it?</P>
<P>It would, in my opinion, be wi&s;e to &s;eize this fir&s;t moment of &s;ucce&s;s to do proudly, what long &s;ince we ought to have done wi&s;ely&mdash;To repeal the obnoxious acts&mdash;To put things on the foot|ing they &s;tood on in 1763&mdash;To unite this coun|try, and to give a ju&s;tification to your friends in America, for adhering to the free and rea&s;onable dependence of that country on this&mdash;This &s;alu|tary and whole&s;ome end, is not to be effected by eva&s;ion and chicane. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Means of conciliation,</HI>"</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which makes &s;uch a figure in the &s;peech.</NOTE> one of the new invented phra&s;es, that aims to convey a &s;en&s;e which facts will not &s;upport. It would convey to the reader, that terms and con|ditions of reconciliation have been rejected by the Americans. It is a truth now univer&s;ally no|torious, that no terms have been offered to them. Lord George Germaine at the end of la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, po&s;itively and ju&s;tly declared, that the commi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="159" REF="178">
neither had, nor could have powers of giving other terms of peace; except tho&s;e of pardon on the laying down their arms. It carried &s;imply the power of accepting <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"unconditioned &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion."</Q> In the dialect of mini&s;ters, this is <HI>means of conciliation;</HI> in the language of common &s;en&s;e, it is a declaration of an eternal war. But, to make peace, terms and conditions mu&s;t be held out; and to &s;atisfy our grand idea of dig|nity, they ought to be held now, in this fir&s;t mo|ment of &s;ucce&s;s. For can we affirm, that war, however &s;ucce&s;sful, is not liable to rever&s;es of fortune? No man can &s;ay where a &s;park may ari&s;e from the apparently extingui&s;hed fire of revolt and in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the&s;e troubles, the majo|rity in both Hou&s;es have not been a&s;hamed to vote the rebellion in America, as confined to one &s;pot; when the very &s;ame di&s;temper, whatever it was, raged over the whole continent. This was done to in&s;tigate a civil war; why &s;hould they be a&s;hamed of a &s;imilar fine&s;&s;e to re&s;tore do|me&s;tic peace, at a time too when we are threat|ened with the ho&s;tility of foreign powers? Let them now vote, that all America is &s;ubdued, and to a people conquered, graciou&s;ly be&s;tow <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and the &s;ecurity of liberty."</Q> The &s;ucce&s;s, real or pretended, may, if they
<PB N="160" REF="179">
plea&s;e, be made the preamble to the act of re|peal and &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>If war be not exempt from mutability, even in this hitherto &s;ingle handed war with our Colonies alone, what will be the con&s;equences of an un|favourable turn in a war with France and Spain united? I would not therefore put my <HI>whole</HI> tru&s;t in war, &s;o as to neglect every thing el&s;e; le&s;t, agree|ably to the mini&s;terial progno&s;tic,) tho' I am far from pre&s;uming to adopt the lofty tone of the epithets &s;o becoming them, but &s;o little becom|ing me,) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if their trea&s;on be &s;uffered to take root, much mi&s;chief <HI>mu&s;t</HI> grow from it, to the &s;afety of the loyal Colonies&mdash;to the commerce of the&s;e kingdoms;&mdash;and indeed to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of all Europe."</Q></P>
<P>May trea&s;on (&s;ince this revolt mu&s;t be &s;o) never take root from the continuance of tyranny!&mdash;This is my prayer. My Lords the Bi&s;hops will hardly find a better, in their form for the fa&s;t.</P>
<P>You will not be farther troubled on the&s;e Ame|rican affairs by your humble &s;ervant, and his coun|try's true, di&s;intere&s;ted, and uninfluenced friend.</P>
