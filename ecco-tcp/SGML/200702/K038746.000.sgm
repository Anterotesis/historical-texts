<HEAD>LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR remembrance of me, with &s;entiments of &s;o much kindne&s;s, has given me the mo&s;t &s;incere &s;atisfaction. It perfectly agrees with the friendly and ho&s;pitable reception which my &s;on and I received from you, &s;ome time &s;ince, when, after an ab&s;ence of twenty-two years, I had the happine&s;s of embracing you, among my few &s;ur|viving friends.</P>
<P>I really imagined that I &s;hould not again in|tere&s;t my&s;elf in any public bu&s;ine&s;s. I had, to the be&s;t of my moderate faculties, paid my club to the Society, which I was born, in &s;ome way or other to &s;erve; and I thought I had a right to put on my night-gown and &s;lippers, and wi&s;h a cheerful evening to the good company I mu&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="3">
leave behind. But if our re&s;olutions of vigour and exertion are &s;o often broken or procra&s;tinated in the exertion; I think we may be excu&s;ed, if we are not very punctual in fulfilling our en|gagements to indolence and inactivity. I have indeed no power of action; and am almo&s;t a cripple, even with regard to thinking: but you de&s;cend with force into the &s;tagnant pool; and you cau&s;e &s;uch a fermentation, as to cure at lea&s;t one impotent creature of his lamene&s;s, though it cannot enable him either to run or to wre&s;tle.</P>
<P>You &s;ee by the paper I take<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The letter is written on folio &s;heets.</NOTE> that I am likely to be long, with malice prepen&s;e. You have brought under my view, a &s;ubject, always dif|ficult, at pre&s;ent critical.&mdash;It has filled my thoughts, which I wi&s;h to lay open to you with the clearne&s;s and &s;implicity which your friend&s;hip demands from me. I thank you for the com|munication of your ideas. I &s;hould be &s;till more plea&s;ed if they had been more your own. What you hint, I believe to be the ca&s;e; that if you had not deferred to the judgment of others, our opinions would not differ more materially at this day, than they did when we u&s;ed to confer on the &s;ame &s;ubject, &s;o many years ago. If I &s;till per&s;evere in my old opinions, it is no &s;mall com|fort
<PB N="5" REF="4">
to me, that it is not with regard to doctrines properly yours, that I di&s;cover my indocility.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e upon which your letter of the 10th of December turns, is hardly before me with preci&s;ion enough, to enable me to form any very certain judgment upon it. It &s;eems to be &s;ome plan of further indulgence propo&s;ed for Catholics of Ireland. You ob&s;erve,
<Q>"that your general principles are not changed, but <HI>that times and circum&s;tances are altered.</HI>"</Q>
I per|fectly agree with you, that times and circum|&s;tances, con&s;idered with reference to the public, ought very much to govern our conduct; though I am far from &s;lighting, when applied with di&s;|cretion to tho&s;e circum&s;tances, general principles and maxims of policy. I cannot help ob&s;erving, however, that you have &s;aid rather le&s;s upon the applicability of your own old principles to the <HI>circum&s;tances</HI> that are likely to influence your conduct again&s;t the&s;e principles, than of the <HI>ge|neral</HI> maxims of &s;tate; which I can very readily believe not to have great weight with you per|&s;onally.</P>
<P>In my pre&s;ent &s;tate of imperfect information, you will pardon the errors into which I may
<PB N="6" REF="5">
ea&s;ily fall. The principles you lay down are,
<Q>"that the Roman Catholics &s;hould enjoy every thing <HI>under</HI> the &s;tate, but &s;hould not be <HI>the &s;tate it&s;elf.</HI>"</Q>
And you add,
<Q>"that when you exclude them from being <HI>a part of the &s;tate,</HI> you rather conform to the &s;pirit of the age, than to any ab&s;tract doctrine;" but you con|&s;ider the con&s;titution is already e&s;tabli&s;hed&mdash;that our &s;tate is Prote&s;tant.</Q>
<Q>"It was declared &s;o at the revolution. It was &s;o provided in the acts for &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown:&mdash;the King's coronation oath was enjoined, in order to keep it &s;o. The King, as fir&s;t magi&s;trate of the &s;tate, is obliged to take the oath of ab|juration, and to &s;ub&s;cribe the declaration; and, by laws &s;ub&s;equent, every other magi&s;|trate and member of the &s;tate, and legi&s;lature and executive, are bound under the &s;ame obli|gation."</Q></P>
<P>As to the plan to which the&s;e maxims are applied, I cannot &s;peak, as I told you, po&s;itively about it. Becau&s;e, neither from your letter, nor from any information I have been able to collect, do I find any thing &s;ettled, either on the part of the Roman Catholics them&s;elves, or on that of any per&s;ons who may wi&s;h to conduct their affairs in Parliament. But if I have leave to
<PB N="7" REF="6">
conjecture, &s;omething is in agitation towards admitting them, under <HI>certain qualifications,</HI> to have <HI>&s;ome &s;hare</HI> in the election of members of par|liament. This I under&s;tand is the &s;cheme of tho&s;e who are intitled to come within your de&s;cription of per&s;ons of con&s;ideration, property, and charac|ter: and firmly attached to the king and con&s;titu|tion as by
<Q>"law e&s;tabli&s;hed, with a grateful &s;en&s;e of your former conce&s;&s;ions, and a patient re|liance on the benignity of parliament, for the further mitigation of the laws that &s;till affect them."</Q>&mdash;As to the low, thoughtle&s;s, wild and profligate, who have joined them&s;elves with tho&s;e of other profe&s;&s;ions, but of the &s;ame character; you are not to imagine, that, for a moment, I can &s;uppo&s;e them to be met, with any thing el&s;e than the manly and enlightened energy of a firm government, &s;upported by the united efforts of all virtuous men, if ever their proceedings &s;hould become &s;o con&s;iderable as to demand its notice. I really think that &s;uch a&s;&s;ociations &s;hould be cru&s;hed in their very commencement.</P>
<P>Setting this, therefore, out of the que&s;tion, it becomes an object of very &s;erious con&s;ideration, whether, becau&s;e wicked men of <HI>various</HI> de&s;criptions are engaged in &s;editious cour&s;es, the rational, &s;ober, and valuable part of <HI>one</HI> de&s;cription &s;hould not
<PB N="8" REF="7">
be indulged their &s;ober and rational expectations? You, who have looked deeply into the &s;pirit of the Popery laws, mu&s;t be perfectly &s;en&s;ible, that a great part of the pre&s;ent mi&s;chief, which we abhor in common, has ari&s;en from them. Their declared object was to reduce the Catholics of Ireland to a mi&s;erable populace, without property, with|out e&s;timation, without education. The profe&s;|&s;ed object was to deprive the few men who, in &s;pite of tho&s;e laws, might hold or obtain any property among&s;t them, of all &s;ort of influence or authority over the re&s;t. They divided the nation into two di&s;tinct bodies, without com|mon intere&s;t, &s;ympathy or connexion; one of which bodies was to po&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>all</HI> the franchi&s;es, <HI>all</HI> the property, <HI>all</HI> the education: The others were to be drawers of water and cutters of turf for them. Are we to be a&s;toni&s;hed that when, by the efforts of &s;o much violence in conque&s;t, and &s;o much policy in regulation, continued without intermi&s;&s;ion for near an hundred years, we had reduced them to a mob; that whenever they came to act at all, many of them would act exactly like a mob, with|out temper, mea&s;ure, or fore&s;ight? Surely it might be ju&s;t now a matter of temperate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, whether you ought not apply a remedy to the real cau&s;e of the evil&mdash;to rai&s;e an ari&s;tocratic intere&s;t; that is, an intere&s;t of property and education
<PB N="9" REF="8">
among&s;t them: and to &s;trengthen by every prudent means, the authority and influence of men of that de&s;cription. It will de&s;erve your be&s;t thoughts, to examine whether this can be done without giving &s;uch per&s;ons the means of de|mon&s;trating to the re&s;t, that &s;omething more is to be got by their temperate conduct, than can be expected from the will and &s;en&s;ele&s;s projects of tho&s;e, who do not belong to their body, who have no intere&s;t in their well being, and only wi&s;h to make them the dupes of their turbulent ambition.</P>
<P>If the ab&s;urd per&s;ons you mention find no way of providing for liberty, but by overturn|ing this happy con&s;titution, and introducing a frantic democracy, let us take care how we pre|vent better people from any rational expectations of partaking in the benefits of that con&s;titution <HI>as it &s;tands.</HI> The maxims you e&s;tabli&s;h cut the matter &s;hort. They have no &s;ort of connexion with the good or ill behaviour of the per&s;ons who &s;eek relief, or with the proper or improper means by which they &s;eek it. They form a per|petual bar to all pleas and to all expectations.</P>
<P>You begin by a&s;&s;erting that
<Q>"they ought to enjoy all things <HI>under</HI> the &s;tate, but that they
<PB N="10" REF="9">
ought not to <HI>be the &s;tate.</HI>"</Q>
A po&s;ition which, I believe, in the latter part of it, and in the lati|tude there expre&s;&s;ed, no man of common &s;en&s;e has ever thought proper to di&s;pute: becau&s;e the contrary implies, that the &s;tate ought to be in them <HI>exclu&s;ively.</HI> But before you have fini&s;hed the line, you expre&s;s your&s;elf as if the other mem|ber of your propo&s;ition, namely, that
<Q>"they ought not to be <HI>a part</HI> of the &s;tate," were nece&s;&s;arily included in your fir&s;t&mdash;Whereas I conceive it to be as different, as a part is from the whole; that is ju&s;t as different as po&s;&s;ible.</Q>
I know indeed that it is common with tho&s;e who talk very different from you, that is with heat and animo&s;ity, to confound tho&s;e things, and to argue the admi&s;&s;ion of the Catholics into any, however minute and &s;ubordinate parts of the &s;tate, as a &s;urrender into their hands of the whole government of the kingdom. To them I have nothing at all to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Wi&s;hing to proceed with a deliberative &s;pirit and temper in &s;o very &s;erious a que&s;tion, I &s;hall attempt to analyze, as well as I can, the prin|ciples you lay down, in order to &s;it them for the gra&s;p of an under&s;tanding &s;o little comprehen&s;ive as mine&mdash;'State'&mdash;'Prote&s;tant'&mdash;'Revolution'&mdash;The&s;e are terms, which if not well explained,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
may lead us into many errors.&mdash;In the word <HI>State,</HI> I conceive there is much ambiguity. The &s;tate is &s;ometimes u&s;ed to &s;ignify <HI>the whole com|mon-wealth,</HI> comprehending all its orders, with the &s;everal privileges belonging to each. Some|times it &s;ignifies only <HI>the higher and ruling part</HI> of the common-wealth; which we commonly call <HI>the Government.</HI> In the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e, to be under the &s;tate, but not the &s;tate it&s;elf, <HI>nor any part of it,</HI> is a &s;ituation perfectly intelligible: but to tho&s;e who fill that &s;ituation, not very plea|&s;ant, when it is under&s;tood. It is a &s;tate of <HI>civil &s;ervitude</HI> by the very force of the definition. <HI>Servorum non e&s;t re&s;publica,</HI> is a very old and a very true maxim. This &s;ervitude, which makes men <HI>&s;ubject</HI> to a &s;tate without being <HI>citizens,</HI> may be more or le&s;s tolerable from many cir|cum&s;tances: but the&s;e circum&s;tances, more or le&s;s favourable, do not alter the nature of the thing. The mildne&s;s by which ab&s;olute ma&s;ters exerci&s;e their dominion, leaves them ma&s;ters &s;till. We may talk a little pre&s;ently of the manner in which the majority of the people of Ireland (the Catholics) are affected by this &s;itu|ation; which at pre&s;ent undoubtedly is theirs, and which you are of opinion, ought to continue for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">In the other &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>State,</HI> by which is under&s;tood the <HI>Supreme Government</HI> only, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve this upon the que&s;tion: that to exclude whole cla&s;&s;es of men entirely from this <HI>part</HI> of government, cannot be con&s;idered as <HI>ab|&s;olute &s;lavery.</HI> It only implies a lower and de|graded &s;tate of citizen&s;hip; &s;uch is (with more or le&s;s &s;trictne&s;s) the condition of all countries, in which an hereditary nobility po&s;&s;e&s;s the ex|clu&s;ive rule. This may be no bad mode of government; provided that the per&s;onal autho|rity of individual nobles be kept in due bounds, that their cabals and factions are guarded again&s;t with a &s;evere vigilance: and that the people, (who have no &s;hare in granting their own money) are &s;ubjected to but light impo&s;itions, and are otherwi&s;e treated with attention, and with indul|gence to their humours and prejudices.</P>
<P>The republic of Venice is one of tho&s;e which &s;trictly confines all the great functions and of|fices, &s;uch as are truly <HI>&s;tate</HI>-functions and <HI>&s;tate</HI>-offices, to tho&s;e who, by hereditary right or ad|mi&s;&s;ion, are noble Venetians. But there are many offices, and &s;ome of them not mean nor unprofitable, which are re&s;erved for the <HI>Citadini.</HI> Of the&s;e all citizens of Venice are capable. The inhabitants of the <HI>Terra firma,</HI> who are mere &s;ub|jects
<PB N="13" REF="12">
of conque&s;t, that is, as you expre&s;s it, un|der the &s;tate, but "not a part of it," are not, however, &s;ubjects in &s;o very rigorous a &s;en&s;e as not to be capable of numberle&s;s &s;ubordinate em|ployments. It is indeed one of the advantages attending the narrow bottom of their ari&s;tocracy (narrow as compared with their acquired domi|nions, otherwi&s;e broad enough) that an exclu|&s;ion from &s;uch employments cannot po&s;&s;ibly be made among&s;t their &s;ubjects. There are, be&s;ides, advantages in &s;tates &s;o con&s;tituted, by which tho&s;e who are con&s;idered as of an inferior race, are indemnified for their exclu&s;ion from the govern|ment and from noble employments. In all the&s;e countries, either by expre&s;s laws, or by u&s;age more operative, the noble ca&s;ts are almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally, in their turn, excluded from commerce, manufacture, farming of land, and in general from all lucrative civil profe&s;&s;ions. The nobles have the monopoly of honour. The plebeians a monopoly of all the means of acquiring wealth. Thus &s;ome &s;ort of a balance is formed among conditions; a &s;ort of compen&s;ation is furni&s;hed to tho&s;e, who, in a <HI>limited &s;en&s;e,</HI> are excluded from the government of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Between the extreme of <HI>a total exclu&s;ion,</HI> to which your maxim goes, and <HI>an univer&s;al un|modified</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<HI>capacity,</HI> to which the fanatics pretend, there are many different degrees, and &s;tages, and a great variety of temperaments, upon which prudence may give full &s;cope to its exertions. For you know that the deci&s;ions of prudence (contrary to the &s;y&s;tem of the in&s;ane rea&s;oners) differ from tho&s;e of judicature: and that al|mo&s;t all the former are determined on the more or the le&s;s, the earlier or the later, and on a balance of advantage and inconvenience, of good and evil.</P>
<P>In all con&s;iderations which turn upon the que&s;tion of ve&s;ting or continuing the &s;tate &s;olely and exclu&s;ively in &s;ome one de&s;cription of citi|zens; prudent legi&s;lators will con&s;ider, how far <HI>the general form and principles of their common|wealth render it fit to be co&s;t into an cligarchi|cal &s;hape, or to remain always in it.</HI> We know that the government of Ireland (the &s;ame as the Briti&s;h) is not in its con&s;titution <HI>wholly</HI> Ari&s;to|cratical; and as it is not &s;uch in its form, &s;o neither is it in its &s;pirit. If it had been inve|terately ari&s;tocratical, exclu&s;ions might be more patiently &s;ubmitted to. The lot of one plebeian would be the lot of all; and an habitual reve|rence and admiration of certain families, might make the people content to &s;ee government
<PB N="15" REF="14">
wholly in hands to whom it &s;eemed naturally to belong. But our con&s;titution has <HI>a plebeian member,</HI> which forms an e&s;&s;ential integrant part of it. A plebeian oligarchy is a mon&s;ter in it&s;elf: and no people, not ab&s;olutely dome&s;tic or predial &s;laves, will long endure it. The Pro|te&s;tants of Ireland are not <HI>alone</HI> &s;ufficiently the people to form a democracy; and they are <HI>too numerous</HI> to an&s;wer the ends and purpo&s;es of <HI>an ari&s;tocracy.</HI> Admiration, that fir&s;t &s;ource of obe|dience, can be only the claim or the impo&s;ture of the few. I hold it to be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for two millions of plebeians, compo&s;ing certain|ly a very clear and decided majority in that cla&s;s, to become &s;o far in love with &s;ix or &s;even hun|dred thou&s;and of their fellow-citizens (to all out|ward appearance plebeians like them&s;elves, and many of them trade&s;men, &s;ervants, and other|wi&s;e inferior to them) as to &s;ee with &s;atisfaction, or even with patience, an exclu&s;ive power ve&s;ted in them, by which con&s;titutionally they become their ab&s;olute ma&s;ters; and by the manners derived from their circum&s;tances, mu&s;t be capa|ble of exerci&s;ing upon them, daily and hourly, an in&s;ulting and vexatious &s;uperiority; nor are they indemnified (as in &s;ome ari&s;tocracies) for this &s;tate of humiliating va&s;&s;alage (often inverting the nature of things and relations) by having the
<PB N="16" REF="15">
lower walks of indu&s;try wholly abandoned to them. They are rivalled, to &s;ay the lea&s;t of the matter, in every laborious and lucrative cour&s;e of life: while every franchi&s;e, every honour, every tru&s;t, every place down to the very lowe&s;t and lea&s;t confidential (be&s;ides whole profe&s;&s;ions), is re&s;erved for the ma&s;ter ca&s;t.</P>
<P>Our con&s;titution is not made for great, gene|ral, and pro&s;criptive exclu&s;ions; &s;ooner or later, it will de&s;troy them, or they will de&s;troy the con&s;titution. In our con&s;titution there has al|ways been a difference made between <HI>a fran|chi&s;e</HI> and <HI>an office,</HI> and between the capacity for the one and for the other. Franchi&s;es were &s;up|po&s;ed to belong to the <HI>&s;ubject,</HI> as <HI>a &s;ubject,</HI> and not <HI>as a member of the governing part of the &s;tate.</HI> The policy of Government has con|&s;idered them as things very different: for whil&s;t Parliament excluded by the te&s;t acts (and for a while the&s;e te&s;t acts were not a dead letter, as now they are in England) Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters from all civil and military employments, they <HI>never touched their right of voting for members of Parliament, or &s;itting in either Hou&s;e</HI>; a point I &s;tate, not as approving or condemning the mea|&s;ure of exclu&s;ion from employments, but to prove
<PB N="17" REF="16">
that the di&s;tinction has been admitted in legi&s;|lature, as, in truth, it is founded in rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I will not here examine, whether the princi|ples of the Briti&s;h [the Iri&s;h] con&s;titution, be wi&s;e or not. I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume that they are; and that tho&s;e who partake the franchi&s;es which make it, partake of a benefit. They who are excluded from votes (under proper qualifications inherent in the con&s;titution that gives them) are excluded, not from the <HI>&s;tate,</HI> but from <HI>the Briti&s;h con&s;titution.</HI> They cannot by any po&s;|&s;ibility, whil&s;t they hear its prai&s;es continually rung in their ears, and are pre&s;ent at the declara|tion which is &s;o generally and &s;o bravely made by tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s the privilege&mdash;that the be&s;t blood in their veins ought to be &s;hed, to pre&s;erve their &s;hare in it; they cannot, I &s;ay, think them&s;elves in an <HI>happy</HI> &s;tate, to be utterly excluded from all its direct and all its con&s;e|quential advantages. The popular part of the con&s;titution mu&s;t be to them, by far the mo&s;t odious part of it. To them it is not <HI>an actual,</HI> and, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till le&s;s a <HI>virtual</HI> repre&s;enta|tion. It is indeed the direct contrary. It is power unlimited, placed in the hands of <HI>an ad|ver&s;e</HI> de&s;cription, <HI>becau&s;e it is an adver&s;e de|&s;cription.</HI> And if they who compo&s;e the pri|vileged
<PB N="18" REF="17">
body have not an intere&s;t, they mu&s;t but too frequently have motives of pride, pa&s;&s;ion, petulance, peevi&s;h jealou&s;y, or tyrannic &s;u&s;pi|cion, to urge them to treat the people with con|tempt and rigour.</P>
<P>This is not a mere theory; though whil&s;t men are men, it is a theory that cannot be fal&s;e. I do not wi&s;h to revive all the particulars in my memory; I wi&s;h them to &s;leep for ever; but it it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould wholly forget, what happened in &s;ome parts of Ireland, with very few and &s;hort intermi&s;&s;ions, from the year 1761 to the year 1766, both inclu&s;ive. In a country of mi&s;erable police, pa&s;&s;ing from the extremes of laxity to the extremes of rigour, among a ne|glected, and therefore di&s;orderly populace&mdash;if any di&s;turbance or &s;edition, from any grievance real or imaginary happened to ari&s;e, it was pre|&s;ently perverted from its true nature (often criminal enough in it&s;elf to draw upon it a &s;evere appropriate puni&s;hment), it was meta|morpho&s;ed into a con&s;piracy again&s;t the &s;tate, and pro&s;ecuted as &s;uch. The object was, that tho&s;e per&s;ons in the obnoxious de&s;cription (in which all offenders will be mo&s;t commonly found, becau&s;e the mo&s;t numerous and the mo&s;t wretched) who could not ea&s;ily, from their character and property, be &s;u&s;pected of the
<PB N="19" REF="18">
crimes of the lowe&s;t people, might be involved in the odium, in the &s;u&s;picion, and &s;ometimes in the puni&s;hment, of a higher and far more criminal &s;pecies of offence. This did not ari&s;e from any one of the Popery laws &s;ince repealed, but from this circum&s;tance, that the people of that de&s;cription had no hold on the gentlemen who a&s;pired to be popular repre&s;entatives; and that the candidates neither loved, nor re&s;pected, nor feared them individually or collectively. I do not think this evil (an evil among&s;t a thou|&s;and others) at this day entirely over; for I conceive I have lately &s;een &s;ome indication of a di&s;po&s;ition perfectly &s;imilar to the old ones; that is, a di&s;po&s;ition to carry the imputation of crimes from per&s;ons to de&s;criptions, and wholly to alter the character and quality of the offences them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>This univer&s;al exclu&s;ion &s;eems to me a &s;eri|ous evil&mdash;becau&s;e many collateral oppre&s;&s;ions, be&s;ides what I have ju&s;t now &s;tated, have ari&s;en from it. In things of this nature, it would not be either ea&s;y or proper to quote chapter and ver&s;e: but I have great rea&s;on to believe, particularly &s;ince the octenial act, that &s;everal have refu&s;ed at all to let their lands to Roman Catholics; becau&s;e it would &s;o far di&s;|able them from promoting &s;uch intere&s;ts in
<PB N="20" REF="19">
counties as they were inclined to favour. They who con&s;ider al&s;o the &s;tate of all &s;orts of trade&s;|men, &s;hopkeepers, and particularly publicans in towns, mu&s;t &s;oon di&s;cern the di&s;advantages under which tho&s;e labour who have no votes. It cannot be otherwi&s;e, whil&s;t the &s;pirit of elec|tions, and the tendencies of human nature con|tinue as they are. If property be artificially &s;epa|rated from franchi&s;e, the franchi&s;e mu&s;t in &s;ome way or other, and in &s;ome proportion, naturally attract property to it. Many are the collateral di&s;advantages, among&s;t a <HI>privileged</HI> people, which mu&s;t attend tho&s;e who have <HI>no</HI> privileges. Among the rich, each individual is of import|ance; the poor and the middling are no other|wi&s;e &s;o, than as they obtain &s;ome collective ca|pacity, and can be aggregated to &s;ome corps. If legal ways are not found, illegal will be re|&s;orted to; and &s;editious clubs and confederacies, &s;uch as no man living holds in greater horror than I do, will grow and flouri&s;h, in &s;pite, I am afraid, of any thing which can be done to pre|vent the evil. Lawful enjoyment is the &s;ure&s;t method to prevent unlawful gratification. Where there is property, there will be le&s;s theft; where there is marriage, there will always be le&s;s fornication.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid enough of the que&s;tion of &s;tate,
<PB N="21" REF="20">
<HI>as it affects the people, merely as &s;uch.</HI> But it is complicated with a political que&s;tion relative to religion, to which it is very nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething; becau&s;e the term <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> which you apply, is too general for the conclu|&s;ions which one of your accurate under&s;tanding would wi&s;h to draw from it; and becau&s;e a great deal of argument will depend on the u&s;e that is made of that term.</P>
<P>It is <HI>not</HI> a fundamental part of the &s;ettlement at the revolution, that the &s;tate &s;hould be pro|te&s;tant without <HI>any qualification of the term.</HI> With a qualification it is unque&s;tionably true; not in all its latitude. With the qualification, it was true before the revolution. Our predece&s;|&s;ors in legi&s;lation were not &s;o irrational (not to &s;ay impious) as to form an opero&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment, and even to render the &s;tate it&s;elf in &s;ome degree &s;ub&s;ervient to it, when their reli|gion (if &s;uch it might be called) was nothing but a mere <HI>negation</HI> of &s;ome other&mdash;without any po|&s;itive idea either of doctrine, di&s;cipline, wor&s;hip, or morals, which they profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, and which they impo&s;ed upon others, even under penalties and incapacities&mdash;No! No! This never could have been done even by rea&s;onable Athei&s;ts. They who think religion of no import|ance
<PB N="22" REF="21">
to the &s;tate have abandoned it to the con|&s;cience, or caprice of the individual; they make no provi&s;ion for it what&s;oever, but leave every club to make, or not, a voluntary contribution according to their fancies. This would be con|&s;i&s;tent. The other always appeared to me to be a mon&s;ter of contradiction and ab&s;urdity. It was for that rea&s;on, that &s;ome years ago I &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the clergy who petitioned, to the number of about three hundred, to be freed from the &s;ub&s;cription to the 39 Articles, without propo&s;ing to &s;ub&s;titute any other in their place. There never has been a religion of the &s;tate (the few years of the Parliament only excepted) but that of <HI>the church of England</HI>; the church of England, before the reformation, connected with the See of Rome, &s;ince then, di&s;connected and pro|te&s;ting again&s;t &s;ome of her doctrines, and the whole of her authority, as binding in our na|tional church: nor did the fundamental laws of this kingdom (in Ireland it has been the &s;ame) ever know, at any period, any other church <HI>as an object of e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI>; or in that light, any other Prote&s;tant religion. Nay our Prote&s;tant <HI>toleration</HI> it&s;elf at the revolution, and until within a few years, required a &s;ignature of thirty-&s;ix, and a part of a thirty-&s;eventh, out of the thirty-nine Articles. So little idea had they at the re|volution of <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hing</HI> Prote&s;tanti&s;m indefinitely,
<PB N="23" REF="22">
that they did not indefinitely <HI>tolerate</HI> it under that name. I do not mean to prai&s;e that &s;trict|ne&s;s, where nothing more than merely religious toleration is concerned. Toleration being a part of moral and political prudence, ought to be tender and large, and not too &s;crupulous in its inve&s;tigations; but may bear without blame, not only very ill-grounded doctrines, but even many things that are po&s;itively vices, where they are <HI>adulta et praevalida.</HI> The good of the common-wealth is the rule which rides over the re&s;t; and to this every other mu&s;t completely &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>The church of Scotland knows as little of Prote&s;tanti&s;m <HI>undefined,</HI> as the church of Eng|land and Ireland do. She has by the articles of union &s;ecured to her&s;elf the perpetual e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of <HI>the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith,</HI> and the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> church government. In England, even during the troubled interregnum, it was not thought fit to e&s;tabli&s;h a <HI>negative</HI> religion; but the Parliament &s;ettled the <HI>Pre&s;byterian,</HI> as the church <HI>di&s;cipline</HI>; the directory, as the rule of public <HI>wor&s;hip</HI>; and the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter catechi&s;m,</HI> as the in&s;titute of <HI>faith.</HI> This is to &s;hew, that at no time was the Prote&s;tant religion <HI>undefined,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed here, or any where el&s;e, as I believe. I am &s;ure that when the three religions were
<PB N="24" REF="23">
e&s;tabli&s;hed in Germany, they were expre&s;sly characterized and declared to be the <HI>Evangelic</HI> and <HI>Reformed,</HI> and the <HI>Catholic</HI>; each of which has its confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and its &s;ettled di&s;ci|pline; &s;o that you always may know the be&s;t and the wor&s;t of them, to enable you to make the mo&s;t of what is good, and to correct or qualify, or guard again&s;t whatever may &s;eem evil or dangerous.</P>
<P>As to the coronation oath, to which you allude as oppo&s;ite to admitting a Roman Catholic to the u&s;e of any franchi&s;e what&s;oever, I cannot think that the king would be perjured if he gave his a&s;&s;ent to any regulation which Parliament might think fit to make, with regard to that affair. The king is bound by law, as clearly &s;pecified in &s;everal acts of Parliament, to be in communion with the church of England. It is a part of the tenure by which he holds his crown; and though no provi&s;ion was made till the revolution, which could be called po&s;itive and valid in law, to a&s;certain this great principle; I have always con&s;idered it as in fact funda|mental, that the king of England &s;hould be of the Chri&s;tian religion, according to the national legal church for the time being. I conceive it was &s;o before the reformation, and that &s;ince the reformation it became doubly nece&s;&s;ary;
<PB N="25" REF="24">
becau&s;e the king is the head of that church; in &s;ome &s;ort an eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;on; and it would be incongruous and ab&s;urd, to have the head of the church of one faith, and the members of another. The king may <HI>inherit</HI> the crown as a <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> but he cannot <HI>hold it</HI> according to law, without being a Prote&s;tant <HI>of the church of England.</HI></P>
<P>Before we take it for granted, that the king is bound by his coronation oath, not to admit any of his Catholic &s;ubjects to the rights and liberties, which ought to belong to them as Engli&s;hmen (not as religioni&s;ts) or to &s;ettle the conditions or proportions of &s;uch admi&s;&s;ion by an act of Parliament; I wi&s;h you to place before your eyes that oath it&s;elf, as it is &s;ettled in the act of William and Mary.</P>
<P><Q>"Will you to the utmo&s;t of your power main|tain&mdash;^1The laws of God&mdash;^2the true Profe&s;&s;ion of ^3the go&s;pel&mdash;and ^4The prote&s;tant reformed religion <HI>as it is e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</HI>&mdash;^5And will you pre&s;erve unto <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> and clergy, and the churches committed to <HI>their</HI> charge, all &s;uch rights and privileges as by law do, or &s;hall appertain to them, or any of them.&mdash;All this I promi&s;e to do."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25">Here are the coronation engagements of the King. In them I do not find one word to pre|clude his Maje&s;ty from con&s;enting to any arrangement which Parliament may make with regard to the civil privileges of any part of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s, on account of the light which it may throw on this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, to look a little more narrowly into the matter of that oath&mdash;in order to di&s;cover how far it has hi|therto operated as a bar to any proceedings of the Crown and Parliament, in favour of tho&s;e again&s;t whom it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that the king has engaged to &s;upport the Prote&s;tant church of England in the two kingdoms, in which it is e&s;tabli&s;hed by law. Fir&s;t, the king &s;wears he will maintain to the utmo&s;t of his power,
<Q>"the laws of God."</Q>
I &s;uppo&s;e it means the natural moral laws.&mdash;Secondly, he &s;wears to maintain "the true profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel." By which I &s;uppo&s;e is under&s;tood <HI>affirmatively</HI> the Chri&s;tian religion.&mdash;Thirdly, that he will maintain
<Q>"the Prote&s;tant reformed religion."</Q>
This leaves me no power of &s;uppo&s;ition or conjecture; for it is defined and de&s;cribed by the &s;ub&s;equent words, "e&s;tabli&s;hed by law," and in this in&s;tance to
<PB N="27" REF="26">
define it beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, he
<Q>"&s;wears to maintain the bi&s;hops and clergy, and the churches committed to their charge," in their rights, pre&s;ent and future.</Q></P>
<P>This oath as effectually prevents the King from doing any thing to the prejudice of the church in favour of Sectaries, Jews, Mahometans, or plain avowed Infidels; ju&s;t as if he &s;hould do the &s;ame thing in favour of the Catholics. You will &s;ee, that it is the &s;ame Prote&s;tant Church, &s;o de&s;cribed, which the King is to maintain and communicate with, according to the act of &s;et|tlement of the 12th and 13th of William III. The act of the 5th of Anne, made in pro&s;pect of the union, is entitled
<Q>"An act for &s;ecuring the Church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed."</Q>
It meant to guard the church implicitly again&s;t any other mode of Prote&s;tant religion which might creep in by means of the union. It proves be|yond all doubt, that the legi&s;lature did not mean to guard the church on one part only, and to leave it defencele&s;s and expo&s;ed upon every other. This church, in that act, is declared to be "fundamental and e&s;&s;ential" for ever, in the co&s;titution of the united kingdom, &s;o far as England is concerned; and I &s;uppo&s;e as the law
<PB N="28" REF="27">
&s;tands, even &s;ince the independence, it is &s;o in Ireland.</P>
<P>All this &s;hews, that the religion which the King is bound to maintain, has a po&s;itive part in it as well as a negative; and that the po&s;itive part of it (in which we are in perfect agreement with the Catholics and with the Church of Scot|land) is infinitely the mo&s;t valuable and e&s;&s;en|tial. Such an agreement we had with Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters in England, of tho&s;e de&s;criptions who came under the toleration act of King William and Queen Mary; an act coeval with the revo|lution; and which ought, on the principles of the gentlemen who oppo&s;e the relief to the Ca|tholics, to have been held &s;acred and unaltera|ble. Whether we agree with the pre&s;ent Pro|te&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters in the points at the revolution held e&s;&s;ential and fundamental among Chri&s;tians, or in any other fundamental, at pre&s;ent it is im|po&s;&s;ible for us to know; becau&s;e, at their own very earne&s;t de&s;ire, we have repealed the tole|ration act of William and Mary, and di&s;charged them from the &s;ignature required by that act; and becau&s;e we know that, for the far greater part, they publicly declare again&s;t all manner of confe&s;&s;ions of faith, even the <HI>con&s;en&s;us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="28">I dwell a little the longer upon this matter, and take the more pains, to put us both in mind that it was not &s;ettled at the revolution, that the &s;tate &s;hould be prote&s;tant, in the latitude of the term, but in a defined and limited &s;en&s;e only, and that, in that &s;en&s;e only, the King is &s;worn to main|tain it, for rea&s;ons forcible enough at all times, but at this time peculiarly &s;o. To &s;up|po&s;e that the King has &s;worn with his utmo&s;t power to maintain what it is wholly out of his power to di&s;cover, or which, if he could di&s;co|ver, he might di&s;cover to con&s;i&s;t of things di|rectly contradictory to each other, &s;ome of them perhaps, impious, bla&s;phemous, and &s;editious upon principle, would be not only a gro&s;s, but a mo&s;t mi&s;chievous ab&s;urdity. It would make a merit of di&s;&s;enting from the church of England, becau&s;e the man happens to di&s;&s;ent from the church of Rome al&s;o; for a man is certainly the mo&s;t perfect Prote&s;tant, and the mo&s;t perfect Di&s;&s;enter, who prote&s;ts again&s;t, and di&s;&s;ents from the whole Chri&s;tian Religion. Whether a per&s;on's having no Chri&s;tian Religion, be a title to favour in exclu&s;ion to the large&s;t de&s;cription of Chri&s;|tians who hold all the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, though holding along with them &s;ome errors and &s;ome &s;uperfluities, is rather more than any man
<PB N="30" REF="29">
who has not become recreant and apo&s;tate from his bapti&s;m, will, I believe, choo&s;e to affirm. The countenance given from a &s;pirit of contro|ver&s;y to that negative religion, may, by degrees, encourage light and unthinking people to a total indifference to every thing po&s;itive in matters of doctrine; and, in the end, of practice too. If continued, it would play the game of that &s;ort of of active, pro&s;elytizing, and per&s;ecuting athei&s;m, which is the di&s;grace and calamity of our time, and which we &s;ee to be as capable of &s;ubvert|ing a government, as any mode of mi&s;guided zeal for better things.</P>
<P>Now let us fairly &s;ee what cour&s;e has been taken relative to tho&s;e, again&s;t whom, in part at lea&s;t, the King has &s;worn to maintain a church, <HI>po&s;i|tive in its doctrine and its di&s;cipline.</HI> The fir&s;t thing done, even when the oath was fre&s;h in the mouth of the &s;overeigns, was to give a toleration to Pro|te&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, <HI>who&s;e doctrines they a&s;certained.</HI> As to the mere civil privileges which the Di&s;|&s;enters held as &s;ubjects before the revolution, the&s;e were not touched at all. The laws have fully permitted, in a qualification for all offices, to &s;uch Di&s;&s;enters, <HI>an occa&s;ional conformity</HI>; a thing I believe &s;ingular, where te&s;ts are admit|ted. The act called the Te&s;t Act it&s;elf, is, with
<PB N="31" REF="30">
regard to them, grown to be hardly any thing more than a dead letter. Whenever the Di&s;|&s;enters cea&s;e by their conduct to give any alarm to the government, in church and &s;tate, I think it very probable that even this matter, rather di&s;gu&s;tful than inconvenient to them, may be removed, or at lea&s;t &s;o modified as to di&s;tingui&s;h the qualification to tho&s;e offices which really <HI>guide the &s;tate,</HI> from tho&s;e which are <HI>merely in&s;trumental</HI>; or that &s;ome other and better te&s;ts may be put in their place.</P>
<P>So far as to England. In Ireland you have outran us. Without waiting for an Engli&s;h ex|ample, you have totally, and without any modi|fication what&s;oever, repealed the te&s;t as to Pro|te&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters. Not having the repealing act by me, I ought not to &s;ay po&s;itively that there is no exception in it; but if it be, what I &s;uppo&s;e you know very well, that a Jew in religion, or a Mahometan, or even <HI>a public, declared Athie&s;t,</HI> and bla&s;phemer, is perfectly qualified to be lord lieutenant, a lord ju&s;tice, or even keeper of the king's con&s;cience; and by virtue of his office (if with you it be as it is with us) admini&s;trator to a great part of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical patronage of the crown.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31">Now let us deal a little fairly. We mu&s;t ad|mit, that Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;ent was one of the quar|ters from which danger was apprehended at the revolution, and again&s;t which a part of the coro|nation oath was peculiarly directed. By this unqualified repeal, you certainly did not mean to deny that it was the duty of the crown to pre&s;erve the church again&s;t Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;en|ters; or taking this to be the true &s;en&s;e of the two revolution acts of King William, and of the previous and &s;ub&s;equent union acts of Queen Anne, you did not declare by this mo&s;t unqualified repeal, by which you broke down all the barriers, not invented, indeed, but carefully pre&s;erved at the revolution; you did not then and by that proceeding declare, that you had advi&s;ed the king to perjury towards God, and perfidy towards the church. No! far, very far from it! you never would have done it, if you did not think it could be done with perfect repo&s;e to the royal con&s;cience, and perfect &s;afety to the national e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. You did this upon a full con&s;ideration of the circum&s;tances of your country. Now if circum&s;tances required it, why &s;hould it be contrary to the king's oath, his par|liament judging on tho&s;e circum&s;tances, to re&s;tore to his Catholic people, in &s;uch mea&s;ure, and
<PB N="33" REF="32">
with &s;uch modifications as the public wi&s;dom &s;hall think proper to add, <HI>&s;ome part</HI> in the&s;e franchi&s;es which they formerly had held without any limitation at all, and which, upon no &s;ort of urgent rea&s;on at the time, they were deprived of? If &s;uch means can with any probability be &s;hewn, from circum&s;tances, rather to add &s;trength to our mixed eccle&s;ia&s;tical and &s;ecular con&s;titution, than to weaken it; &s;urely they are means infinitely to be preferred to penalties, incapacities and pro&s;criptions continued from generation to gene|ration. They are perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the other parts of the Coronation Oath, in which the king &s;wears to maintain
<Q>"the laws of God and the true profe&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel, and to govern the people according to the &s;tatutes in Parliament agreed upon, and the laws and cu&s;toms of the realm."</Q>
In con&s;enting to &s;uch a &s;tatute, the Crown would act at lea&s;t as agree|ble to the laws of God, and to the true pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel, and to the laws and cu&s;toms of the kingdom, as George I. did when he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tatute which took from the body of the people, every thing which, to that hour, and even after the mon&s;trous acts of the 2d and 8th of Anne, (the objects of common hatred) they &s;till enjoyed inviolate.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">It is hard to di&s;tingui&s;h with the la&s;t degree of accuracy, what laws are fundamental, and what not. However there is a di&s;tinction authorized by the writers on juri&s;prudence, and recognized in &s;ome of our &s;tatutes. I admit the acts of King William and Queen Anne to be fundamental, but they are not the <HI>only</HI> fundamental laws. The law called <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> by which it is pro|vided that,
<Q>"no man &s;hall be di&s;&s;eized of his liberties and free cu&s;toms but by the judg|ment of his peers, or the laws of the land" (meaning clearly for &s;ome proved crime tried and adjudged), I take to be a <HI>fundamental law.</HI></Q>
Now, although this Magna Charta, or &s;ome of the &s;tatutes e&s;tabli&s;hing it, provide that that law &s;hall be perpetual, and all &s;tatutes contrary to it &s;hall be void: yet I cannot go &s;o far as to deny the authority of &s;tatutes made in defiance of Magna Charta and all its principles. This how|ever I will &s;ay, that it is a very venerable law, made by very wi&s;e and learned men, and that the legi&s;lature in their attempt to perpetuate it, even again&s;t the authority of future parliaments, have &s;hewn their judgment that it is <HI>funda|mental,</HI> on the &s;ame grounds, and in the &s;ame manner that the act of the fifth of Anne has con&s;idered, and declared the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church of England to be fundamental. Magna Charta, which &s;ecured the&s;e franchi&s;es to the
<PB N="35" REF="34">
&s;ubjects, regarded the rights of freeholders in counties to be as much a fundamental part of the con&s;titution, as the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church of England was thought either at that time, or in the act of King William, or in the act of Queen Anne.</P>
<P>The churchmen, who led in that tran&s;action, certainly took care of the material intere&s;t of which they were the natural guardians. It is the fir&s;t article of Magna Charta,
<Q>"that the church of England &s;hall be free," &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q>
But churchmen, and barons, and knights, took care of the franchi&s;es and free cu&s;toms of the peo|ple too. Tho&s;e franchi&s;es are part of the con|&s;titution it&s;elf, and in&s;eparable from it. It would be a very &s;trange thing if there &s;hould not only exi&s;t, anomalies in our laws, a thing not ea&s;y to prevent, but, that the fundamental parts of the con&s;titution &s;hould be perpetually and irrecon|cilably at variance. I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf that the lovers of our church are not as able to find effectual ways of reconciling its &s;afety with the franchi&s;es of the people, as the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of the thirteenth century were able to do; I cannot conceive how any thing wor&s;e can be &s;aid of the Prote&s;tant religion of the church of England than this, that wherever it is judged proper to give it a legal e&s;tabli&s;hment,
<PB N="36" REF="35">
it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to deprive the body of the people, if they adhere to their old opinions, of "their liberties and of all their free cu&s;|toms," and to reduce them to a &s;tate of <HI>civil</HI> &s;er|vitude.</P>
<P>There is no man on earth, I believe, more willing than I am to lay it down as a fundamen|tal of the con&s;titution, that the church of Eng|land &s;hould be united and even identified with it: but allowing this, I cannot allow that all <HI>laws of regulation,</HI> made from time to time, in &s;upport of that fundamental law, are, of cour&s;e, equally fundamental and equally unchangeable. This would be to confound all the branches of legi&s;|lation and of juri&s;prudence.&mdash;The <HI>Crown</HI> and the per&s;onal &s;afety of the monarch are <HI>funda|mentals</HI> in our con&s;titution: Yet, I hope that no man regrets, that the rabble of &s;tatutes got toge|ther during the reign of Henry the Eighth, by which trea&s;ons are multiplied with &s;o prolific an energy, have been all repealed in a body; al|though they were all, or mo&s;t of them, made in &s;upport of things truly fundamental in our con|&s;titution. So were &s;everal of the acts by which the crown exerci&s;ed its &s;upremacy; &s;uch as the act of Elizabeth, for making the <HI>high commi&s;&s;ion courts,</HI> and the like; as well as things made trea&s;on in the time of Charles II. None of this &s;pecies of
<PB N="37" REF="36">
<HI>&s;econdary and &s;ub&s;idiary laws</HI> have been held funda|mental. They have yielded to circum&s;tances: particularly where they were thought, even in their con&s;equences, or obliquely, to affect other fundamentals. How much more, certainly, ought they to give way, when, as in our ca&s;e, they effect, not here and there, in &s;ome particular point, or in their con&s;equence, but univer&s;ally, collectively, and directly, the fundamental fran|chi&s;es of a people, equal to the whole inhabi|tants of &s;everal re&s;pectable kingdoms and &s;tates; equal to the &s;ubjects of the kings of Sardinia or Denmark; equal to tho&s;e of the United Nether|lands; and more than are to be found in all the &s;tates of Switzerland. This way of pro&s;cribing men by whole nations, as it were, from all the benefits of the con&s;titution to which they were born, I never can believe to be politic or expe|dient, much le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for the exi&s;tence of any &s;tate or church in the world. Whenever I &s;hall be convinced, which will be late and reluc|tantly, that the &s;afety of the church is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with all the civil rights what&s;oever of the far larger part of the inhabitants of our country, I &s;hall be extremely &s;orry for it; be|cau&s;e I &s;hall think the church to be truly in danger. It is putting things into the po&s;ition of
<PB N="38" REF="37">
an ugly alternative, into which, I hope in God, they never will be put.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid mo&s;t of what occurs to me on the topics you touch upon, relative to the religion of the king, and his coronation oath. I &s;hall conclude the ob&s;ervations which I wi&s;hed to &s;ub|mit to you on this point, by a&s;&s;uring you, that I think you the mo&s;t remote that can be con|ceived from the metaphy&s;icians of our times, who are the mo&s;t fooli&s;h of men, and who, dealing in univer&s;als and e&s;&s;ences, &s;ee no difference be|tween more and le&s;s; and who of cour&s;e would think that the rea&s;on of the law which obliged the king to be a communicant of the church of England, would be as valid to exclude a Catho|lic from being an exci&s;eman, or to deprive a man who has five hundred a year, under that de&s;crip|tion, from voting on a par with a factitious Pro|te&s;tant Di&s;&s;enting freeholder of forty &s;hillings.</P>
<P>Recollect, my dear friend, that it was a funda|mental principle in the French monarchy, whil&s;t it &s;tood, that the &s;tate &s;hould be Catholic; yet the edict of Nantz gave, not a full eccle&s;ia&s;tical, but a complete civil <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> with places of which only they were capable, to the Calvini&s;ts of France; and there were very few employments indeed of which they were not capable. The
<PB N="39" REF="38">
world prai&s;ed the Cardinal de Richlieu, who took the fir&s;t opportunity to &s;trip them of their fortified places and cautionary towns. The &s;ame world held and does hold in execration (&s;o far as that bu&s;ine&s;s is concerned) the memory of Louis the Fourteenth, for the total repeal of that favourable edict; though the talk of
<Q>"funda|mental laws, e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, religion of the prince, &s;afety to the &s;tate," <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> was then as largely held, and with as bitter a revival of the animo&s;ities of the civil confu&s;ions during the &s;truggles between the parties, as now they can be in Ireland.</Q></P>
<P>Perhaps there are tho&s;e who think that the &s;ame rea&s;on does not hold when the religious relation of the &s;overeign and &s;ubject is changed; but they who have their &s;hop full of fal&s;e weights and mea&s;ures, and who think that the adding or taking away the name of Prote&s;tant or Papi&s;t, Guelph or Ghibelline, alters all the principles of equity, policy, and prudence, leave us no com|mon data upon which we can rea&s;on. I therefore pa&s;s by all this, which on you will make no im|pre&s;&s;ion, to come to what &s;eems to be a &s;erious con&s;ideration in your mind; I mean the dread you expre&s;s of
<Q>"reviewing, for the purpo&s;e of altering, the <HI>principles of the Revolution.</HI>"</Q>
This is an intere&s;ting topic; on which I will, as fully
<PB N="40" REF="39">
as your lei&s;ure and mine permits, lay before you the ideas I have formed.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly confound in my mind all the things which were done at the Revolu|tion, with the <HI>principles</HI> of the Revolution. As in mo&s;t great changes many things were done from the nece&s;&s;ities of the time, well or ill un|der&s;tood, from pa&s;&s;ion or from vengeance, which were not only, not perfectly agreeable to its prin|ciples, but in the mo&s;t direct contradiction to them. I &s;hall not think that the <HI>deprivation of &s;ome millions of people of all the rights of citizens, and all intere&s;t in the con&s;titution, in and to which they were born,</HI> was a thing conformable to the <HI>declared principles</HI> of the Revolution. This I am &s;ure is true relatively to England (where the operation of the&s;e <HI>anti principles</HI> comparatively were of little extent), and &s;ome of our late laws on that &s;ubject admit it. But the Revolution operated differently in England and Ireland, in many, and the&s;e e&s;&s;ential particulars. Suppo&s;|ing the principles to have been altogether the &s;ame in both kingdoms, by the application of tho&s;e principles to very different objects, the whole &s;pirit of the &s;y&s;tem was changed, not to &s;ay rever&s;ed. In England it was the &s;truggle of the <HI>great body</HI> of the people for the e&s;tabli&s;hment
<PB N="41" REF="40">
of their liberties, again&s;t the efforts of a very <HI>&s;mall faction,</HI> who would have oppre&s;&s;ed them. In Ireland it was the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the power of the &s;maller number, at the expence of the civil liberties and properties of the far greater part; and at the expence of the political liber|ties of the whole. It was, to &s;ay the truth, not a revolution, but a conque&s;t; which is not to &s;ay a great deal in its favour. To in&s;i&s;t on every thing done in Ireland at the Revolution, would be to in&s;i&s;t on the &s;evere and jealous policy of a conqueror, in the crude &s;ettlement of his new acqui&s;ition, as a <HI>permanent</HI> rule for its future government. This, no power, in no country that ever I heard of, has done or profe&s;&s;ed to do&mdash;except in Ireland; where it is done, and po&s;|&s;ibly by &s;ome people will be profe&s;&s;ed. Time has, by degrees, in all other places and periods, blended and coalited the conquered with the conquerors. So, after &s;ome time, and after one of the mo&s;t rigid conque&s;ts that we read of in hi&s;tory, the Normans &s;oftened into the Engli&s;h. I wi&s;h you to turn your recollection to the fine &s;peech of Cerealis to the Gauls, to di&s;&s;uade them from revolt. Speaking of the Romans,&mdash;
<Q>"<HI>Nos</HI> quamvis toties lace&s;&s;iti, jure victoriae id &s;olum vobis addidimus, quo pacem tueremur; nam
<PB N="42" REF="41">
neque quies gentium &s;ine armis; neque arma &s;ine &s;tipendiis; neque &s;tipendia &s;ine tributis, haberi queant. <HI>Caetera in communi &s;ita &s;unt:</HI> ip&s;i plerumque no&s;tris exercitibus <HI>prae&s;idetis:</HI> ip&s;i has alia&s;que provincias, <HI>regitis: nil &s;eperatum clau|&s;umve</HI>&mdash;Proinde Pacem et urbem, quam <HI>victo|res victique eodem jure obtinemus,</HI> amate, colite."</Q>
You will con&s;ider, whether the arguments u&s;ed by that Roman to the&s;e Gauls, would apply to the ca&s;e in Ireland; and whether you could u&s;e &s;o plau&s;ible a preamble to any &s;evere warning you might think it proper to hold out to tho&s;e who &s;hould re&s;ort to &s;edition in&s;tead of &s;uppli|cation, to obtain any object that they may pur&s;ue with the governing power.</P>
<P>For a much longer period than that which had &s;ufficed to blend the Romans with the nation to which of all others they were the mo&s;t adver&s;e, the Prote&s;tants &s;ettled in Ireland, con&s;idered them&s;elves in no other light than that of a &s;ort of a colonial garri&s;on, to keep the natives in &s;ubjection to the other &s;tate of Great Britain. The whole &s;pirit of the revolution in Ireland, was that of not the milde&s;t conqueror. In truth, the &s;pirit of tho&s;e proceedings did not commence at that aera, nor was religion of any kind their
<PB N="43" REF="42">
primary object What was done, was not in the &s;pirit of a conte&s;t between two religious factions; but between two adver&s;e nations. The &s;tatutes of Kilkenny &s;hew, that the &s;pirit of the popery laws, and &s;ome even of their actual provi&s;ions, as applied between Engli&s;hry and Iri&s;hry, had exi&s;ted in that hara&s;&s;ed country before the words Prote&s;tant and Papi&s;t were heard of in the world. If we read Baron Finglas, Spen&s;er, and Sir John Davis, we cannot mi&s;s the true genius and policy of the Engli&s;h government there before the re|volution, as well as during the whole reign of Queen Elizabeth. Sir John Davis boa&s;ts of the benefits received by the natives, by extending to them the Engli&s;h law, and turning the whole kingdom into &s;hire ground. But the appearance of things alone was changed. The original &s;cheme was never deviated from for a &s;ingle hour. Unheard of confi&s;cations were made in the nor|thern parts, upon grounds of plots and con&s;pi|racies, never proved upon their &s;uppo&s;ed authors. The war of chicane &s;ucceeded to the war of arms and of ho&s;tile &s;tatutes; and a regular &s;eries of operations were carried on, particularly from Chiche&s;ter's time, in the ordinary courts of ju&s;|tice, and by &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ions and inqui&s;itions; fir&s;t, under pretence of tenures, and then of ti|tles in the crown, for the purpo&s;e of the total
<PB N="44" REF="43">
extirpation of the intere&s;t of the natives in their own &s;oil&mdash;until this &s;pecies of &s;ubtile ravage, being carried to the la&s;t exce&s;s of oppre&s;&s;ion and in&s;olence under Lord Stafford, it kindled at length the flames of that rebellion which broke out in 1641. By the i&s;&s;ue of that war, by the turn which the Earl of Clarendon gave to things at the re&s;toration, and by the total reduction of the kingdom of Ireland in 1691; the ruin of the native Iri&s;h, and in a great mea&s;ure too, of the fir&s;t races of the Engli&s;h, was completely accompli&s;hed. The new Engli&s;h intere&s;t was &s;ettled with as &s;olid a &s;tability as any thing in human affairs can look for. All the penal laws of that unparalleled code of oppre&s;&s;ion, which were made after the la&s;t event, were manife&s;tly the effects of national hatred and &s;corn towards a conquered people; whom the victors delighted to trample upon, and were not at all afraid to provoke. They were not the effect of their fears but of their &s;ecurity. They who carried on this &s;y&s;tem, looked to the irre&s;i&s;tible force of Great Britain for their &s;upport in their acts of power. They were quite certain that no com|plaints of the natives would be heard on this &s;ide of the water, with any other &s;entiments than tho&s;e of contempt and indignation. Their cries &s;erved only to augment their torture. Ma|chines
<PB N="45" REF="44">
which could an&s;wer their purpo&s;es &s;o well, mu&s;t be of an excellent contrivance. Indeed at that time in England, the double name of the complainants, Iri&s;h and Papi&s;ts (it would be hard to &s;ay, &s;ingly, which was the mo&s;t odious) &s;hut up the hearts of every one again&s;t them. Whil&s;t that temper prevailed, and it prevailed in all its force to a time within our memory, every mea|&s;ure was plea&s;ing and popular, ju&s;t in propor|tion as it tended to hara&s;s and ruin a &s;et of people, who were looked upon as enemies to God and man; and indeed as a race of bigotted &s;avages who were a di&s;grace to human nature it&s;elf.</P>
<P>However, as the Engli&s;h in Ireland began to be domiciliated, they began al&s;o to recollect that they had a country. The <HI>Engli&s;h intere&s;t</HI> at fir&s;t by faint and almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible degrees, but at length openly and avowedly, became an <HI>independ|ent Iri&s;h intere&s;t</HI>; full as independent as it could ever have been, if it had continued in the per|&s;ons of the native Iri&s;h; and it was maintained with more &s;kill, and more con&s;i&s;tency than pro|bably it would have been in theirs. With their views, they changed their maxims&mdash;it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to demon&s;trate to the whole people, that
<PB N="46" REF="45">
there was &s;omething at lea&s;t, of a common intere&s;t, combined with the independency, which was to become the object of common exertions. The mildne&s;s of government pro|duced the fir&s;t relaxation towards the Iri&s;h; the nece&s;&s;ities, and, in part too, the temper that predominated at this great change, pro|duced the &s;econd and the mo&s;t important of the&s;e relaxations. Engli&s;h government, and Iri&s;h legi&s;lature felt jointly the propriety of this mea&s;ure. The Iri&s;h parliament and nation be|came independent.</P>
<P>The true revolution to you, that which mo&s;t intrin&s;ically and &s;ub&s;tantially re&s;embled the Engli&s;h revolution of 1688, was the Iri&s;h revo|lution of 1782. The Iri&s;h Parliament of 1782, bore little re&s;emblance to that which &s;at in that kingdom, after the period of the fir&s;t revolution; it bore a much nearer re&s;emblance (though not at all in its temper) to that which &s;at under King James. The change of the Parliament in 1782 from the character of the Parliament which, as a token of its indignation, had burned all the journals indi&s;criminately of the former Parliament in the council chamber, was very vi&s;ible. The addre&s;s of King William's Parlia|ment,
<PB N="47" REF="46">
the Parliament which a&s;&s;embled after the Revolution, among&s;t other cau&s;es of complaint (many of them &s;ufficiently ju&s;t), complains of the repeal by their predece&s;&s;ors of Poyning's law; no ab&s;olute idol with the Parliament of 1782.</P>
<P>Great Britain finding the Anglo-Iri&s;h highly animated with a &s;pirit, which had indeed &s;hewn it&s;elf before, though with little energy, and many interruptions, and therefore &s;uffered a multitude of uniform precedents to be e&s;tabli&s;hed again&s;t it, acted in my opinion, with the greate&s;t tem|perance and wi&s;dom. She &s;aw, that the di&s;po|&s;ition of the <HI>leading part</HI> of the nation, would not permit them to act any longer the part of a <HI>gar|ri&s;on.</HI> She &s;aw, that true policy did not require that they ever &s;hould have appeared in that character; or if it had done &s;o formerly, the rea|&s;ons had now cea&s;ed to operate. She &s;aw that the Iri&s;h of her race, were re&s;olved, to build their con&s;titution and their politics, upon another bottom. With tho&s;e things under her view, &s;he in&s;tantly complied with the whole of your demands, without any re&s;ervation what&s;over. She &s;urrendered that boundle&s;s &s;uperiority, for the pre&s;ervation of which, and the acqui&s;ition, &s;he had &s;upported the Engli&s;h colonies in Ireland for &s;o long a time, and at &s;o va&s;t an expence

(according to the &s;tandard of tho&s;e ages) of her blood and trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>When we bring before us the matter which hi&s;tory affords for our &s;election, it is not im|proper to examine the &s;pirit of the &s;everal pre|cedents, which are candidates for our choice. Might it not be as well for your &s;tate&s;men, on the other &s;ide of the water, to take an exam|ple from this latter, and &s;urely more conciliatory revolution, as a pattern for your conduct towards your own fellow-citizens, than from that of 1688, when a paramount &s;overeignty over both you and them, was more loftily claimed, and more &s;ternly exerted, than at any former, or at any &s;ub&s;equent period? Great Britain in 1782, ro&s;e above the vulgar ideas of policy, the ordi|nary jealou&s;ies of &s;tate, and all the &s;entiments of national pride and national ambition, If &s;he had been more di&s;po&s;ed than, I thank God for it, &s;he was, to li&s;ten to the &s;ugge&s;tions of pa&s;&s;ion, than to the dictates of prudence; &s;he might have urged the principles, the maxims, the policy, the practice of the revolution, again&s;t the de|mands of the leading de&s;cription in Ireland, with full as much plau&s;ibility, and full as good a grace, as any among&s;t them can po&s;&s;ibly do, again&s;t the &s;upplications of &s;o va&s;t and exten&s;ive
<PB N="49" REF="48">
a de&s;cription of their own people. A good deal too, if the &s;pirit of domination and exclu&s;ion had prevailed in England, might be excepted again&s;t &s;ome of the means then employed in Ireland, whil&s;t her claims ware in agitation; they were, at lea&s;t, as much out of ordinary cour&s;e, as tho&s;e which are now objected again&s;t admitting your people to any of the benefits of an Engli&s;h con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t certainly, neither with you, nor here, was any one ignorant of what was at that time &s;aid, written, and done. But on all &s;ides we &s;e|parated the means from the end: and we &s;epa|rated the cau&s;e of the moderate and rational, from the ill-intentioned and &s;editious; which on &s;uch occa&s;ions are &s;o frequently apt to march to|gether. At that time, on your part, you were not afraid to review what was done at the revo|lution of 1688; and what had been continued during the &s;ub&s;equent flouri&s;hing period of the Briti&s;h empire. The change then made was a great and fundamental alteration. In the execu|tion, it was an opero&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s on both &s;ides of the water. It required the repeal of &s;everal laws; the modification of many, and a new cour&s;e to be given to an infinite number of legi&s;|lative, judicial, and official practices and u&s;ages
<PB N="50" REF="49">
in both kingdoms. This did not frighten any of us. You are now a&s;ked to give, in &s;ome mo|derate mea&s;ure, to your fellow-citizens, what Great Britain gave to you, without any mea&s;ure at all. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all the difficulties at the time, and the apprehen&s;ions which &s;ome very well-meaning people entertained, through the admirable temper in which this revolution (or re&s;toration in the nature of a revolution) was conducted in both kingdoms; it has hitherto produced no inconvenience to either; and I tru&s;t, with the continuance of the &s;ame temper, that it never will. I think that this &s;mall incon&s;idera|ble change relative to an exclu&s;ion &s;tatute (not made at the revolution) for re&s;toring the people to the benefits, from which the green &s;orene&s;s of a civil war had not excluded them, will be productive of no &s;ort of mi&s;chief what&s;oever. Compare what was done in 1782, with what is wi&s;hed in 1792; con&s;ider the &s;pirit of what has been done at the &s;everal periods of reformation; and weigh maturely, whether it be exactly true, that conciliatory conce&s;&s;ions, are of good policy only in di&s;cu&s;&s;ions between nations; but that among de&s;criptions in the &s;ame nation, they mu&s;t always be irrational and dangerous. What have you &s;uffered in your peace, your pro&s;perity, or, in what ought ever to be dear to a nation, your
<PB N="51" REF="50">
glory, by the la&s;t act by which you took the pro|perty of that people under the protection of the <HI>laws?</HI> What rea&s;on have you to dread the con|&s;equences of admitting the people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that propety to &s;ome &s;hare in the protection of the <HI>con&s;titution?</HI></P>
<P>I do not mean to trouble you with any thing to remove the objections, I will not call them arguments, again&s;t this mea&s;ure, taken from a ferocious hatred to all that numerous de&s;cription of Chri&s;tians. It would be to pay a poor com|pliment to your under&s;tanding or your heart. Neither <HI>your</HI> religion, nor <HI>your</HI> politics con&s;i&s;t "in odd perver&s;e antipathies." You are not re&s;olved to per&s;evere in pro&s;cribing from the con&s;titution, &s;o many millions of your country|men, becau&s;e, in contradiction to experience and to common &s;en&s;e, you think proper to imagine, that their principles are &s;ubver&s;ive of common human &s;ociety. To that I &s;hall only &s;ay, that whoever has a temper, which can be gratified by indulging him&s;elf in the&s;e good-natured fancies, ought to do a great deal more. For an exclu|&s;ion from the privileges of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, is not a cure for &s;o terrible a di&s;temper of the human mind, as they are plea&s;ed to &s;uppo&s;e in their countrymen. I rather conceive tho&s;e privileges
<PB N="52" REF="51">
to be it&s;elf a remedy for &s;ome mental di&s;or|ders.</P>
<P>As little &s;hall I detain you with matters that can as little obtain admi&s;&s;ion into a mind like yours; &s;uch as the fear, or pretence of fear, that in &s;pite of your own power, and the trifling power of Great Britain, you may be conquered by the Pope; or that this commodious bugbear (who is of infinitely more u&s;e to tho&s;e who pre|tend to fear, than to tho&s;e who love him) will ab&s;olve his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects from their allegi|ance, and &s;end over the cardinal of York to rule you as his viceroy; or that, by the plenitude of his power, he will take that fierce tyrant, the king of the French, out of his jail, and arm that nation (which on all occa&s;ions treats his Holine&s;s &s;o very politely) with his bulls and pardons, to invade poor old Ireland, to reduce you to popery and &s;lavery, and to force the free-born, naked feet of your people into the wooden &s;hoes of that arbitrary monarch. I do not believe that di&s;cour&s;es of this kind are held, or that any thing like them will be held, by any who walk about without a keeper. Yet, I confe&s;s, that on oc|ca&s;ions of this nature, I am the mo&s;t afraid of the weake&s;t rea&s;onings; becau&s;e they di&s;cover the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions. The&s;e things will never be
<PB N="53" REF="52">
brought out in definite propo&s;itions; they would not prevent pity towards any per&s;ons; they would only cau&s;e it for tho&s;e who were capable of talking in &s;uch a &s;train. But I know, and am &s;ure, that &s;uch ideas as no man will di&s;tinctly produce to another, or hardly venture to bring in any plain &s;hape to his own mind&mdash;he will ut|ter in ob&s;cure, ill explained doubts, jealou&s;ies, &s;urmi&s;es, fears, and apprehen&s;ions; and that in &s;uch a fog, they will appear to have a good deal of &s;ize, and will make an impre&s;&s;ion; when, if they were clearly brought forth and defined, they would meet with nothing but &s;corn and deri&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is another way of taking an objection to this conce&s;&s;ion, which I admit to be &s;omething more plau&s;ible, and worthy of a more attentive examination. It is, that this numerous cla&s;s of people is mutinous, di&s;orderly, prone to &s;edition, and ea&s;y to be wrought upon by the in&s;idious arts of wicked and de&s;igning men; that con&s;ci|ous of this, the &s;ober, rational, and wealthy part of that body, who are totally of another cha|racter, do by no means de&s;ire any participation for them&s;elves, or for any one el&s;e of their de&s;crip|tion, in the franchi&s;es of the Briti&s;h con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="53">I have great doubt of the exactne&s;s of any part of this ob&s;ervation. But let us admit that the body of the Catholics are prone to &s;edition (of which, as I have &s;aid, I entertain much doubt), is it po&s;&s;ible, that any fair ob&s;erver or fair rea&s;oner, can think of confining this de|&s;cription to them only? I believe it to be po&s;&s;ible for men to be mutinous and &s;editious who feel no grievance: but I believe no man will a&s;&s;ert &s;eri|ou&s;ly, that when people are of a turbulent &s;pirit, the be&s;t way to keep them in order, is to furni&s;h them with &s;omething &s;ub&s;tantial to complain of.</P>
<P>You &s;eparate very properly the &s;ober, rational, and &s;ub&s;tantial part of their de&s;cription from the re&s;t. You give, as you ought to do, weight only to the former. What I have always thought of the matter is this&mdash;that the mo&s;t poor, illiterate, and uninformed creatures upon earth, are judges of a <HI>practical</HI> oppre&s;&s;ion. It is a matter of feel|ing; and as &s;uch per&s;ons generally have felt mo&s;t of it, and are not of an over-lively &s;en&s;i|bility, they are the be&s;t judges of it. But for the <HI>real cau&s;e,</HI> or the <HI>appropriate remedy,</HI> they ought never to be called into council about the one or the other.

when once rou&s;ed, their pa&s;&s;ions are un|governed; becau&s;e they want information; be|cau&s;e the &s;mallne&s;s of the property which indi|vidually they po&s;&s;e&s;s, renders them le&s;s atten|tive to the con&s;equence of the mea&s;ures they adopt in affairs of moment. When I find a great cry among&s;t the people, who &s;peculate little, I think my&s;elf called &s;eriou&s;ly to examine into it, and to &s;eparate the real cau&s;e from the ill effects of the pa&s;&s;ion it may excite; and the bad u&s;e which artful men may make of an irrita|tion of the popular mind. Here we mu&s;t be aided by per&s;ons of a contrary character; we mu&s;t not li&s;ten to the de&s;perate or the furious; but it is therefore nece&s;&s;ary for us to di&s;tingui&s;h who are the <HI>really</HI> indigent, and the <HI>really</HI> in|temperate. As to the per&s;ons who de&s;ire this part in the con&s;titution, I have no rea&s;on to ima|gine that they are per&s;ons who have nothing to lo&s;e and much to look for in public confu&s;ion. The popular meeting from which apprehen&s;ions have been entertained, has a&s;&s;embled. I have accidentally had conver&s;ation with two friends of mine, who knew &s;omething of the gentle|man who was put into the chair upon that oc|ca&s;ion; one of them has had money tran&s;ac|tions with him; the other, from curio&s;ity, has been to &s;ee his concerns: they both tell me he is a man of &s;ome property; but you mu&s;t be
<PB N="56" REF="55">
the be&s;t judge of this, who by your office, are likely to know his tran&s;actions. Many of the others are certainly per&s;ons of fortune; and all, or mo&s;t, fathers of families, men in re&s;pectable ways of life; and &s;ome of them far from con|temptible; either for their information, or for the abilities which they have &s;hewn in the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of their intere&s;ts. What &s;uch men think it for their advantage to acquire, ought not, <HI>prima facia,</HI> to be con&s;idered as ra&s;h or heady, or incompatible with the public &s;afety or welfare.</P>
<P>I admit, that men of the be&s;t fortunes and reputations, and of the be&s;t talents and educa|tion too, may, by accident, &s;hew them&s;elves fu|rious and intemperate in their de&s;ires. This is a great misfortune when it happens; for the fir&s;t pre&s;umptions are undoubtedly in their favour. We have two &s;tandards of judging in this ca&s;e of the &s;anity and &s;obriety of any proceedings of the &s;ubject proceeding; of unequal certainty indeed, but neither of them to be neglected: the fir&s;t is by the value of the object &s;ought, the next is by the means through which it is pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>The object pur&s;ued, I under&s;tand, and have all along rea&s;oned as if it were &s;o, is in &s;ome degree or mea&s;ure to be admitted to the fran|chi&s;es of the con&s;titution. Men are con&s;idered
<PB N="57" REF="56">
as under &s;ome derangement of their intellects, when they &s;ee good and evil in a different light from other men; when they choo&s;e nau&s;eous and unwhole&s;ome food; and reject &s;uch as to the re&s;t of the world &s;eems plea&s;ant, and is known to be nutritive. I have always con&s;idered the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, not to be a thing in it&s;elf &s;o vitious, as that none but men of de|ranged under&s;tanding, and turbulent tempers could de&s;ire a &s;hare in it: on the contrary, I &s;hould think very indifferently of the under|&s;tanding and temper of any body of men, who did not wi&s;h to partake of this great and ac|knowledged benefit. I cannot think quite &s;o favourably either of the &s;en&s;e or temper of tho&s;e, if any &s;uch there are, who would volun|tarily per&s;uade their brethren that the object is not fit for them, or they for the object. What|ever may be my thoughts, I am quite &s;ure, that they who hold &s;uch language, mu&s;t forfeit all credit with the re&s;t. This is infallible&mdash;If they conceive any opinion of their judgment, they cannot po&s;&s;ibly think them their friends. There is, indeed, one &s;uppo&s;ition, which would re|concile the conduct of &s;uch gentlemen to found rea&s;on, and to the pure&s;t affection towards their fellow-&s;ufferers; that is, that they act under the impre&s;&s;ion of a well-grounded fear for the
<PB N="58" REF="57">
general intere&s;t. If they &s;hould be told, and &s;hould believe the &s;tory, that if they dare at|tempt to make their condition better, they will infallibly make it wor&s;e&mdash;that if they aim at obtaining liberty, they will have their &s;lavery doubled&mdash;that their endeavour to put them&s;elves upon any thing which approaches towards an equitable footing with their fellow-&s;ubjects, will be con&s;idered as an indication of a &s;editious and rebellious di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;&s;uch a view of things ought perfectly to re&s;tore the gentlemen, who &s;o anxiou&s;ly di&s;&s;uade their countrymen from wi&s;hing a participation with the privileged part of the people, to the good opinion of their fel|lows. But what is to <HI>them</HI> a very full ju&s;tifica|tion, is not quite &s;o honourable to that power from who&s;e maxims and temper &s;o good a ground of rational terror is furni&s;hed. I think arguments of this kind will never be u&s;ed by the friends of a government which I greatly re|&s;pect; or by any of the leaders of an oppo&s;ition whom I have the honour to know, and the &s;en&s;e to admire. I remember Polybius tells us, that during his captivity in Italy as a Pelopone|&s;ian ho&s;tage&mdash;he &s;olicited old Cato to intercede with the &s;enate for his relea&s;e, and that of his countrymen: this old politician told him that he had better continue in his pre&s;ent condition,

however irk&s;ome, than apply again to that for|midable authority for their relief; that he ought to imitate the wi&s;dom of his countryman Uly&s;&s;es, who, when he was once out of the den of the Cyclops, had too much &s;en&s;e to venture again into the &s;ame cavern. But I conceive too high an opinion of the Iri&s;h Legi&s;lature to think that they are to their fellow citizen, what the grand op|pre&s;&s;ors of mankind were to a people whom the fortune of war had &s;ubjected to their power. For though Cato could do &s;o with re|gard to his &s;enate, I &s;hould really think it nothing &s;hort of impious, to compare an Iri&s;h Parliament to a den of Cyclops. I hope the people, both here and with you, will always apply to their repre&s;entatives with becoming mode&s;ty; but at the &s;ame time with minds unembarra&s;&s;ed with any &s;ort of terror.</P>
<P>As to the means which they employ to obtain this object, &s;o worthy of the &s;ober and rational minds; I do admit that &s;uch means may be u&s;ed in the pur&s;uit of it, as may make it proper for legi&s;lature, in this ca&s;e, to defer their compli|ance until the demandants are brought to a pro|per &s;en&s;e of their duty. A conce&s;&s;ion in which the governing power of our country lo&s;es its dig|nity,
<PB N="60" REF="59">
is dearly bought even by him who obtains his object. All the people have a deep intere&s;t in the dignity of Parliament. But, as the refu&s;al of franchi&s;es which are drawn out of the fir&s;t vital &s;tamina of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, is a very &s;erious thing, we ought to be very &s;ure, that the manner and &s;pirit of the application is offen&s;ive and dangerous indeed, before we ultimately re|ject all applications of this nature. The mode of application, I hear, is by petition. It is the man|ner in which all the &s;overeign powers of the world are approached, and I never heard (except in the ca&s;e of James the &s;econd) that any prince con&s;idered this manner of &s;upplication to be contrary to the humility of a &s;ubject, or to the re&s;pect due to the per&s;on or authority of the &s;o|vereign. This rule, and a corre&s;pondent practice, are ob&s;erved, from the Grand Seignior, down to the mo&s;t petty Prince, or Republic in Europe.</P>
<P>You have &s;ent me &s;everal papers, &s;ome in print, &s;ome in manu&s;cript. I think I had &s;een all of them, except the formula of a&s;&s;ociation. I confe&s;s they appear to me to contain matter mi&s;chievous, and capable of giving alarm, if the &s;pirit in which they are written &s;hould be found to make any con&s;iderable progre&s;s. But I am at a lo&s;s to know how to apply them, as objections
<PB N="61" REF="60">
to the ca&s;e now before us. When I find that <HI>the general committee</HI> which acts for the Roman Catholics in Dublin, prefers the a&s;&s;ociation pro|po&s;ed in the written draft you have &s;ent me, to a re&s;pectful application in Parliament, I &s;hall think the per&s;ons who &s;ign &s;uch a paper, to be unworthy of any privilege which may be thought fit to be granted; and that &s;uch men ought, <HI>by name,</HI> to be excepted from any benefit under the con&s;titution to which they offer this violence. But I do not find that this form of a &s;editious league has been &s;igned by any per&s;on what&s;oever, either on the part of the &s;uppo&s;ed projectors, or on the part of tho&s;e whom it is calculated to &s;e|duce. I do not find, on enquiry, that &s;uch a thing was mentioned, or even remotely alluded to, in the general meeting of the Catholics, from which &s;o much violence was apprehended. I have con&s;idered the other publications, &s;igned by individuals, on the part of certain &s;ocieties&mdash;I may mi&s;take, for I have not the honour of know|ing them per&s;onally, but I take Mr. Butler and Mr. Tandy not to be Catholics, but members of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. Not <HI>one</HI> that I recollect of the&s;e publications, which you and I equally di&s;like, appears to be written by per&s;ons of that per&s;ua&s;ion. Now, if, whil&s;t a man is dutifully &s;oliciting a favour from Parliament, any per&s;on

&s;hould chu&s;e, in an improper manner, to &s;hew his inclination towards the cau&s;e depending; and if that <HI>mu&s;t</HI> de&s;troy the cau&s;e of the petitioner; then, not only the petitioner, but the legi&s;lature it&s;elf is in the power of any weak friend or artful enemy, that the &s;upplicant, or that the Parlia|ment may have. A man mu&s;t be judged by his own actions only. Certain Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters make &s;editious propo&s;itions to the Catholics, which it does not appear that they have yet ac|cepted. It would be &s;trange that the tempter &s;hould e&s;cape all puni&s;hment, and that he who, under circum&s;tances full of &s;eduction and full of provocation, has re&s;i&s;ted the temptation, &s;hould incur the penalty. You know, that, with regard to the Di&s;&s;enters, who are <HI>&s;tated</HI> to be the chief movers in this vile &s;cheme of altering the prin|ciples of election to a right of voting by the head, you are not able (if you ought even to wi&s;h &s;uch a thing) to deprive them of any part of the franchi&s;es and privileges which they hold on a footing of perfect equality with your&s;elves. <HI>They</HI> may do what they plea&s;e with con&s;titu|tional impunity; but the others cannot even li&s;ten with civility to an invitation from them to an ill-judged &s;cheme of liberty, without forfeit|ing, for ever, all hopes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> of tho&s;e liberties which we admit to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> rational.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="62">It is known, I believe, that the greater, as well as the &s;ounder part of our excluded countrymen, have not adopted the wild ideas, and wilder engagement, which have been held out to them; but have rather cho&s;en to hope &s;mall and &s;afe conce&s;&s;ions from the legal power, than boundle&s;s objects from trouble and confu&s;ion.

<P>Ob&s;erve, on the&s;e principles, the difference between the procedure of the Parliament and the Di&s;&s;enters, towards the people in que&s;tion. One employs court&s;hip, the other force. The Di&s;|&s;enters offer bribes, the Parliament nothing but the <HI>front negative</HI> of a &s;tern and forbidding au|thority. A man may be very wrong in his ideas of what is good for him. But no man affronts me, nor can therefore ju&s;tify my affronting him, by offering to make me as happy as him&s;elf, according to his own ideas of happine&s;s. This the Di&s;&s;enters do to the Catholics. You are on the different extremes.

large, in my opinion; and that &s;cheme of elec|tion is known to have been, at all times, per|fectly odious to me.

Our friend, the late Mr. Flood (no &s;light man) propo&s;ed in his place, and in my hearing, a repre&s;entation not much le&s;s exten&s;ive than this, for England; in which every hou&s;e was to be inhabited by a voter&mdash;<HI>in addition</HI> to all the actual votes by other titles&mdash;all tho&s;e (&s;ome of the corporate) which we know do not require a hou&s;e, or a &s;hed. Can I forget that a per&s;on of the very highe&s;t rank, of very large fortune, and of the fir&s;t cla&s;s of ability, brought a bill into the Hou&s;e of Lords, in the head-quarters of ari&s;tocracy, containing identi|cally

the &s;ame project, for the &s;uppo&s;ed adoption of which by a club or two, it is thought right to extingui&s;h all hopes in the Roman Catholics of Ireland?

But the Lords neither did di&s;avow the bill, nor treat it with any di&s;regard, nor expre&s;s any &s;ort of di&s;approbation of its noble author, who has never lo&s;t, with king or people, the lea&s;t degree of the re&s;pect and con&s;ideration which &s;o ju&s;tly belongs to him.</P>
<P>I am not at all enamoured, as I have told you, with this plan of repre&s;entation; as little do I reli&s;h any bandings or a&s;&s;ociations for procuring it. But if the que&s;tion was to be put to you and me&mdash;<HI>univer&s;al</HI> popular repre&s;entation, or <HI>none at all for us and ours</HI>&mdash;we &s;hould find our|&s;elves in a very awkward po&s;ition.

<P>Then, &s;ince our olde&s;t fundamental laws follow, or rather couple, freehold with franchi&s;e; &s;ince no principle of the Revolution &s;hakes the&s;e liberties; &s;ince the olde&s;t and one of the be&s;t monuments of the con&s;titution, demands for the Iri&s;h the privilege which they &s;upplicate; &s;ince the prin|ciples of the Revolution coincide with the de|clarations

of the Great Charter; &s;ince the prac|tice of the Revolution, in this point, did not contradict its principles; &s;ince, from that event, twenty-five years had elap&s;ed, before a domi|neering party, on a party principle, had ventur|ed to disfranchi&s;e, without any proof what&s;oever of abu&s;e, the greater part of the community; &s;ince the King's coronation oath does not &s;tand in his way to the performance of his duty to all his &s;ubjects; &s;ince you have given to all other Di&s;&s;enters the&s;e privileges without limit, which are hitherto withheld, without any limitation what&s;oever, from the Catholics; &s;ince no nation in the world has ever been known to exclude &s;o great a body of men (not born &s;laves) from the civil &s;tate, and all the benefits of its con&s;titution; the whole que&s;tion comes before Parliament, as a matter for its prudence. I do not put the thing on a que&s;tion of right. That di&s;cretion which in judicature is well &s;aid by Lord Coke to be a crooked cord, in legi&s;lature is a golden rule. Supplicants ought not to appear too much in the character of litigants.

For my own part, de&s;iring of all things that the authority of the legi&s;lature under which I was born, and which I cheri&s;h, not only with a duti|ful awe, but with a partial and cordial affection, to be maintained in the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect, I never will &s;uffer my&s;elf to &s;uppo&s;e, that, at bottom, their di&s;cretion will be found to be at variance with their ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The whole being at di&s;cretion, I beg leave ju&s;t to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome matters for your con&s;idera|tion&mdash;Whether the government in church or &s;tate is likely to be more &s;ecure by continuing cau&s;es of grounded di&s;content, to a very great number (&s;ay two millions) of the &s;ubjects? or, Whether the con&s;titution, combined and balanced as it is, will be rendered more &s;olid, by depriving &s;o large a part of the people of all concern, or intere&s;t, or &s;hare, in its repre&s;entation, actual or <HI>virtual?</HI> I here mean to lay an empha&s;is on the word <HI>virtual.</HI> Virtual repre&s;entation is that in which there is a communion of in|intere&s;ts,
<PB N="70" REF="69">
and a &s;ympathy in feelings and de&s;ires between tho&s;e who act in the name of any de|&s;cription of people, and the people in who&s;e name they act, though the tru&s;tees are not actually cho&s;en by them. This is virtual repre|&s;entation. Such a repre&s;entation I think to be, in many ca&s;es, even better than the actual. It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es mo&s;t of its advantages, and is free from many of its inconveniences: it corrects the irregularities in the literal repre&s;entation, when the &s;hifting current of human affairs, or the acting of public intere&s;ts in different ways, carry it obliquely from its fir&s;t line of direction. The people may err in their choice; but common intere&s;t and common &s;entiment are rarely mi&s;|taken. But this &s;ort of virtual repre&s;entation cannot have a long or &s;ure exi&s;tence, if it has not a &s;ub&s;tratum in the actual. The member mu&s;t have &s;ome relation to the con&s;tituent. As things &s;tands, the Catholic, as a Catholic and be|longing to a de&s;cription, has no <HI>virtual</HI> relation to the repre&s;entative; but the <HI>contrary.</HI> There is a relation in mutual obligation. Gratitude may not always have a very la&s;ting power; but the frequent recurrency for favours will re|vive and refre&s;h it, and will nece&s;&s;arily produce &s;ome degree of mutual attention. It will pro|duce,
<PB N="71" REF="70">
at lea&s;t, acquaintance; the &s;everal de&s;crip|tions of people will not be kept &s;o much apart, as if they were not only &s;eparate nations, but &s;e|parate &s;pecies.

Sure I am, that there have been thou&s;ands in Ireland, who have never conver&s;ed with a Roman Catholic in their whole lives, unle&s;s they happened to talk to their gar|diner's workmen, or to a&s;k their way, when they had lo&s;t it, in their &s;ports; or, at be&s;t, who had known them only as footmen, or other dome&s;tics of the &s;econd and third order: and &s;o aver&s;e were they, &s;ome time ago, to have them near their per&s;ons, that they would not employ even tho&s;e who could never find their way beyond the &s;ta|ble. I well remember a great, and, in many re|&s;pects, a good man, who adverti&s;ed for a black|&s;mith; but, at the &s;ame time, added, he mu&s;t be a Prote&s;tant.

If they are not &s;atisfied, you have two millions of &s;ubjects in our bo&s;om, full of unea&s;ine&s;s; not that they cannot overturn the act of &s;ettlement, and put them&s;elves and you under an arbitrary ma&s;ter; or, that they are not permitted to &s;pawn an hydra of wild republics, on principles of a pretended natural equality in man; but, becau&s;e you will not &s;uffer them to enjoy the ancient, fundamental, tried advantages of a Briti&s;h con|&s;titution: that you will not permit them to pro|fit of the protection of a common father, or the freedom of common citizens: and that the only rea&s;on which can be a&s;&s;igned for this disfranchi&s;e|ment, has a tendency more deeply to ulcerate their minds than the act of exclu&s;ion it&s;elf. What the con&s;equence of &s;uch feelings mu&s;t be, it is for you to look to. To warn, is not to menace.</P>
<P>I am far from a&s;&s;erting, that men will not excite di&s;turbances without ju&s;t cau&s;e. I know that &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion is not true. But, neither
<PB N="73" REF="72">
is it true that di&s;turbances have never ju&s;t com|plaints for their origin. I am &s;ure that it is hardly prudent to furni&s;h them with &s;uch cau&s;es of complaint, as every man who thinks the Bri|ti&s;h con&s;titution a benefit, may think, at lea&s;t, colourable and plau&s;ible.</P>
<P>Several are in dread of the manoeuvres of certain per&s;ons among the Di&s;&s;enters, who turn this ill humour to their own ill purpo&s;es. You know, better than I can, how much the&s;e proceedings of certain among the Di&s;&s;enters are to be feared. You are to weigh, with the temper which is natural to you, whether it may be for the &s;afety of our e&s;tabli&s;hment, that the Catholics &s;hould be ultimately per&s;uaded that they have no hope to enter into the con&s;titution, but through the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>Think, whether this be the way to prevent, or di&s;&s;olve factious combinations again&s;t the church, or the &s;tate. Reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on the po&s;&s;ible con&s;equences of keeping, in the heart of your country, a bank of di&s;content, every hour accumulating, upon which every de&s;crip|tion of &s;editious men may draw at plea&s;ure. They, who&s;e principles of faction would di&s;po&s;e
<PB N="74" REF="73">
them to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an arbitrary mo|narchy, will find a nation of men who have no &s;ort of intere&s;t in freedom; but who will have an intere&s;t in that equality of ju&s;tice or favour, with which a wi&s;e de&s;pot mu&s;t view all his &s;ub|jects who do not attack the foundations of his power. Love of liberty it&s;elf may, in &s;uch men, become the means of e&s;tabli&s;hing an arbi|trary domination. On the other hand, they who wi&s;h for a democratic republic, will find a &s;et of men who have no choice between civil &s;ervitude, and the entire ruin of a mixed con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the people or Ireland divided into three parts; of the&s;e (I &s;peak within compa&s;s) two are Catholic. Of the remaining third, one half is compo&s;ed of Di&s;&s;enters. There is no na|tural union between tho&s;e de&s;criptions. It may be produced. If the two parts Catholic be driven into a clo&s;e confederacy with half the third part of Prote&s;tants, with a view to a change in the con&s;titution in church or &s;tate, or both; and you re&s;t the whole of their &s;ecurity on a handful of gentlemen, clergy, and their dependants; compute the &s;trength <HI>you have in Ireland,</HI> to op|po&s;e to grounded di&s;content; to capricious inno|vation; to blind popular fury, and to ambitious
<PB N="75" REF="74">
turbulent intrigue. You mention that the minds of &s;ome gentlemen are a good deal heated: and that it is often &s;aid, that, rather than &s;ubmit to &s;uch per&s;ons having a &s;hare in their franchi&s;es, they would throw up their independence, and precipitate an union with Great Britain.</P>
<P>I have heard a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion concerning &s;uch an union among&s;t all &s;orts of men, ever &s;ince I re|member any thing. For my own part, I have never been able to bring my mind to any thing clear and deci&s;ive upon the &s;ubject. There can|not be a more arduous que&s;tion. As far as I can form an opinion, it would not be for the mutual advantage of the two kingdoms; but per&s;ons more able than I am, think otherwi&s;e. But, whatever the merits of this union may be, to make it a <HI>menace,</HI> it mu&s;t be &s;hewn to be an <HI>evil</HI>; and an evil more particularly to tho&s;e who are threatened with it, than to tho&s;e who hold it out as a terror. I really do not &s;ee how this threat of an union can operate, or that the Catholics are more likely to be lo&s;ers by that mea&s;ure than the churchmen.</P>
<P>The humours of the people, and of politicians too, are &s;o variable in them&s;elves and are &s;o
<PB N="76" REF="75">
much under the occa&s;ional influence of &s;ome lead|ing men, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to know what turn the public mind here would take in &s;uch an event. There is but one thing certain concerning it: that this union would excite a &s;trong ferment on both &s;ides of the water, with &s;trong animo&s;i|ties and violent pa&s;&s;ions, whil&s;t the arrangement continued in agitation. Great divi&s;ions and ve|hement pa&s;&s;ions would precede this union, both on the mea&s;ure it&s;elf and on its terms; and particularly, this very que&s;tion of a &s;hare in the repre&s;entation for the Catholics, from whence the project of an union originated, would form a principal part in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and in the temper in which &s;ome gentlemen &s;eem inclined to throw them&s;elves, by a &s;ort of high indig|nant pa&s;&s;ion, into the &s;cheme, tho&s;e points would not be deliberated with all po&s;&s;ible calm|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>From my be&s;t ob&s;ervation, I &s;hould greatly doubt, whether, in the end, the&s;e gentlemen would obtain their object, &s;o as to make the ex|clu&s;ion of two millions of their countrymen a fundamental article in the union. The demand would be of a nature quite unprecedented. You might obtain the union: and yet, a gentleman
<PB N="77" REF="76">
who, under the new union e&s;tabli&s;hment, wou'd a&s;pire to the honour of repre&s;enting his county, might po&s;&s;ibly be as much obliged, as he may fear to be, under the old &s;eparate e&s;tabli&s;hment, to the un&s;upportable mortification of a&s;king his neighbours, who have a different opinion concern|ing the elements in the &s;acrament, for their votes.</P>
<P>I believe, nay, I am &s;ure, that the people of Great Britain, with or without an union, might be depended upon, in ca&s;es of any real danger, to aid the government of Ireland with the &s;ame cordiality as they would &s;upport their own again&s;t any wicked attempts to &s;hake the &s;ecurity of the happy con&s;titution in church and &s;tate. But, before Great Britain engages in any quar|rel, the <HI>cau&s;e of the di&s;pute</HI> would certainly be a part of her con&s;ideration. If confu&s;ions &s;hould ari&s;e in that kingdom, from too &s;teady an attach|ment to a pro&s;criptive monopolizing &s;y&s;tem, and from the re&s;olution of regarding the fran|chi&s;e, and, in it the &s;ecurity of the &s;ubject, as belonging rather to religious opinions than to ci|vil qualification and civil conduct, I doubt whe|ther you might quite certainly reckon on obtain|ing an aid of force from hence, for the &s;upport of that &s;y&s;tem. We might extend your di&s;trac|tions
<PB N="78" REF="77">
to this country, by taking part in them. England will be indi&s;po&s;ed, I &s;u&s;pect, to &s;end an army for the conque&s;t of Ireland. What was done in 1782 is a deci&s;ive proof of her &s;enti|ments of ju&s;tice and moderation. She will not be fond of making another American war in Ire|land. The principles of &s;uch a war would but too much re&s;emble the former one. The well-di&s;po&s;ed and the ill-di&s;po&s;ed in England, would (for different rea&s;ons perhaps) be equally aver&s;e to &s;uch an enterprize. The confi&s;cations, the public auctions, the private grants, the planta|tions, the tran&s;plantations, which formerly ani|mated &s;o many adventurers, even among &s;ober citizens, to &s;uch Iri&s;h expeditions, and which po&s;&s;ibly might have animated &s;ome of them to the American, can have no exi&s;tence in the ca&s;e that we &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us form a &s;uppo&s;ition (no fooli&s;h or un|grounded &s;uppo&s;ition) that in an age, when men are infinitely more di&s;po&s;ed to heat them&s;elves with political than religious controver&s;ies, the former &s;hould entirely prevail, as we &s;ee that in &s;ome places they have prevailed, over the lat|ter: and that the Catholics of Ireland, from the court&s;hip paid them on the one hand, and the
<PB N="79" REF="78">
high tone of refu&s;al on the other, &s;hould, in order to enter into all the rights of &s;ubjects, all become Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters; and as the others do, take all your oaths. They would all obtain their civil objects, and the change; for any thing I know to the contrary, (in the dark as I am about the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enting tenets) might be of u&s;e to the health of their &s;ouls. But, what &s;ecurity our con&s;titution, in church or &s;tate, could derive from that event, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cern. De|pend upon it, it is as true as nature is true, that if you force them out of the religion of habit, education or opinion, it is not to yours they will ever go. Shaken in their minds, they will go to that where the dogmas are fewe&s;t; where they are the mo&s;t uncertain; where they lead them the lea&s;t to a con&s;ideration of what they have abandoned. They will go to that uniformly democratic &s;y&s;tem, to who&s;e fir&s;t movements they owed their emancipation. I recommend you &s;eriou&s;ly to turn this in your mind. Believe that it requires your be&s;t and mature&s;t thoughts. Take what cour&s;e you plea&s;e&mdash;union or no union; whether the people remain Catholics, or become Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;en|ters, &s;ure it is, that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of monopoly, <HI>cannot</HI> continue.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="79">If England were animated, as I think &s;he is not, with her former &s;pirit of domination, and with the &s;trong theological hatred which &s;he once cheri&s;hed for that de&s;cription of her fellow-chri&s;tians and fellow-&s;ubjects; I am yet con|vinced, that, after the fulle&s;t &s;ucce&s;s in a ruinous &s;truggle, you would be obliged finally to aban|don that monopoly. We were obliged to do this, even when every thing promi&s;ed &s;ucce&s;s in the American bu&s;ine&s;s. If you &s;hould make this experiment at la&s;t, under the pre&s;&s;ure of any nece&s;&s;ity, you never can do it well. But if, in|&s;tead of falling into a pa&s;&s;ion, the leading gentle|men of the country them&s;elves &s;hould undertake the bu&s;ine&s;s cheerfully, and with hearty affection towards it, great advantages would follow. What is forced, cannot be modified; but here, you may mea&s;ure your conce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is a con&s;ideration of great moment, that you may make the de&s;ired admi&s;&s;ion, without alter|ing the &s;y&s;tem of your repre&s;entation in the &s;malle&s;t degree, or in any part. You may leave that deliberation of a parliamentary change or reform, if ever you &s;hould think fit to engage in it, uncomplicated and unembarra&s;&s;ed with the other que&s;tion. Whereas, if they are mixed
<PB N="81" REF="80">
and confounded, as &s;ome people attempt to mix and confound them, no one can an&s;wer for the effects on the con&s;titution it&s;elf.</P>
<P>There is another advantage in taking up this bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ingly and by an arrangement for the &s;ingle object. It is, that you may proceed by <HI>degrees.</HI> We mu&s;t all obey the great law of change, it is the mo&s;t powerful law of nature, and the means perhaps of its con&s;ervation. All we can do, and that human wi&s;dom can do, is to provide that the change &s;hall proceed by in|&s;en&s;ible degrees. This has all the benefits which may be in change, without any of the inconve|niences of mutation. Every thing is provided for as it arrives. This mode will, on the one hand, prevent the <HI>unfixing old intere&s;ts at once</HI>; a thing which is apt to breed a black and &s;ullen di&s;content, in tho&s;e who are at once di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all their influence and con&s;ideration. This gradual cour&s;e, on the other &s;ide, will prevent men, long under depre&s;&s;ion, from being intoxi|cated with a large draught of new power, which they always abu&s;e with a licentious in&s;olence. But, wi&s;hing, as I do, the change to be gradual and cautious, I would, in my fir&s;t &s;teps, lean rather to the &s;ide of enlargement than re&s;triction.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="81">It is one excellence of our con&s;titution, that all our rights of election regard rather property than per&s;on. The &s;tandard may be &s;o low, or not &s;o judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en, as in &s;ome degree to fru&s;trate the end. But all this is for your pru|dence in the ca&s;e before you, You may ri&s;e, a &s;tep or two, the qualification of the Catholic voters. But if you were, to-morrow, to put the Catholic freeholder on the footing of the mo&s;t favoured forty-&s;hilling Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enter, you know that, &s;uch is the actual &s;tate of Ire|land, this would not make a &s;en&s;ible alteration in almo&s;t any <HI>one</HI> election in the kingdom. The effect in their favour, even defen&s;ively, would be infinitely &s;low. But it would be healing; it would be &s;atisfactory and protecting. The &s;tig|ma would be removed. By admitting &s;ettled per|manent &s;ub&s;tance in lieu of the numbers, you would avoid the great danger of our time, that of &s;etting up number again&s;t property. The numbers ought never to be neglected; becau&s;e, (be&s;ides what is due to them as men) collectively, though not individually, they have great pro|perty: they ought to have therefore protection: they ought to have &s;ecurity: they ought to have even con&s;ideration: but they ought not to pre|dominate.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="82">My dear Sir, I have nearly done; I meant to write you a long letter; I have written a long di&s;&s;ertation. I might have done it early and better. I might have been more forcible and more clear, if I had not been interrupted as I have been; and this obliges me not to write to you in my own hand. Though my hand but &s;igns it, my heart goes with what I have written. Since I could think at all, tho&s;e have been my thoughts. You know that thirty-two years ago they were as fully matured in my mind as they are now. A letter of mine to Lord Kenmare, though not by my de&s;ire, and full of le&s;&s;er mi&s;|takes, has been printed in Dublin. It was written ten or twelve years ago, at the time when I began the employment, which I have not yet fini&s;hed, in favour of another di&s;tre&s;&s;ed peo|ple, injured by tho&s;e who have vanqui&s;hed them, or &s;tolen a dominion over them. It contained my &s;entiments then; you will &s;ee how far they accord with my &s;entiments now. Time has more and more confirmed me in them all. The pre&s;ent circum&s;tances fix them deeper in my mind.</P>
<P>I voted la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, if a particular vote could be di&s;tingui&s;hed, in unanimity, for an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
<PB N="84" REF="83">
of the Church of England <HI>conjointly</HI> with the e&s;tabli&s;hment which was made &s;ome years before by act of parliament, of the Roman Ca|tholic, in the French conquered country of Ca|nada. At the time of making this Engli&s;h ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment, we did not think it nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;afety, to de&s;troy the former Gallican church &s;ettlement. In our fir&s;t act we &s;ettled a government altogether monarchical, or nearly &s;o. In that &s;y&s;tem, the Canadian Ca|tholics were far from being deprived of the ad|vantages or di&s;tinctions, of any kind, which they enjoyed under their former monarchy. It is true, that &s;ome people, and among&s;t them one eminent divine, predicted at that time, that by this &s;tep we &s;hould lo&s;e our dominions in Ame|rica. He foretold that the Pope would &s;end his indulgences thither; that the Canadians would fall in with France; declare their independence, and draw or force our colonies into the &s;ame de&s;ign. The independence happened according to his prediction; but in directly the rever&s;e or|der. All our Engli&s;h Prote&s;tant colonies re|volted. They joined them&s;elves to France; and it &s;o happened that Popi&s;h Canada was the only place which pre&s;erved its fidelity; the only place in which France got no footing; the only
<PB N="85" REF="84">
peopled colony which now remains to Great Britain. Vain are all the progno&s;tics taken from ideas and pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;urvive the &s;tate of things which give ri&s;e to them. When la&s;t year we gave a popular repre&s;entation to the &s;ame Canada, by the choice of the landholders, and an ari&s;tocratic repre&s;entation, at the choice of the crown, neither was the choice of the crown, nor the election of the landholders, limited by a con&s;ideration of religion. We had no dread for the Prote&s;tant church, which we &s;ettled there, becau&s;e we permitted the French Catholics, in the utmo&s;t latitude of the de&s;cription, to be free &s;ubjects. They are good &s;ubjects, I have no doubt; but I will not allow that any French Canadian Catholics are better men or better citizens than the Iri&s;h of the &s;ame communion. Pa&s;&s;ing from the extremity of the we&s;t, to the extremity almo&s;t of the ea&s;t; I have been many years (now entering into the twelfth) employed in &s;upporting the rights, privileges, laws and immunities of a very remote people. I have not as yet been able to fini&s;h my ta&s;k. I have &s;truggled through much di&s;couragement and much oppo&s;ition; much obloquy; much calumny, for a people with whom I have no tie, but the common bond of mankind. In this
<PB N="86" REF="85">
I have not been left alone. We did not &s;ly from our undertaking, becau&s;e the people were Ma|hometans or Pagans, and that a great majority of the Chri&s;tians among&s;t them were Papi&s;ts. Some gentlemen in Ireland, I dare &s;ay, have good rea&s;ons for what they may do, which do not occur to me. I do not pre&s;ume to condemn them; but, thinking and acting, as I have done, towards the&s;e remote nations, I &s;hould not know how to &s;hew my face, here or in Ireland, if I &s;hould &s;ay that all the Pagans, all the Mu&s;&s;ul|men, and even Papi&s;ts (&s;ince they mu&s;t form the highe&s;t &s;tage in the climax of evil) are wor|thy of a liberal and honourable condition, ex|cept tho&s;e of one of the de&s;criptions, which forms the majority of the inhabitants of the coun|try in which you I and were born. If &s;uch are the Catholics of Ireland; ill-natured and unju&s;t people, from our own data, may be inclined not to think better of the Prote&s;tants of a &s;oil, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to infu&s;e into its &s;ects a kind of venom unknown in other places.</P>
<P>You hated the old &s;y&s;tem as early as I did. Your fir&s;t juvenile lance was broken again&s;t that giant. I think you were even the fir&s;t who attacked the grim phantom. You have an ex|ceeding
<PB N="87" REF="86">
good under&s;tanding, very good humour, and the be&s;t heart in the world. The dictates of that temper and that heart, as well as the policy pointed out by that under&s;tanding, led you to abhor the old code. You abhorred it, as I did, for its vicious perfection. For I mu&s;t do it ju&s;tice: it was a complete &s;y&s;tem, full of coherence and con&s;i&s;tency; well dige&s;ted and well compo&s;ed in all its parts. It was a ma|chine of wi&s;e and elaborate contrivance; and as well fitted for the oppre&s;&s;ion, impoveri&s;hment and degradation of a people, and the deba&s;e|ment, in them, of human nature it&s;elf, as ever proceeded from the perverted ingenuity of man. It is a thing humiliating enough, that we are doubtful of the effect of the medicines we com|pound. We are &s;ure of our poi&s;ons. My opi|nion ever was (in which I heartily agreed with tho&s;e that admired the old code) that it was &s;o con&s;tructed, that if there was once a breach in any e&s;&s;ential part of it; the ruin of the whole, or nearly of the whole, was, at &s;ome time or other, a certainty. For that rea&s;on I honour, and &s;hall for ever honour and love you, and tho&s;e who fir&s;t cau&s;ed it to &s;tagger, crack, and gape.&mdash;Others may fini&s;h; the beginners have the glory; and, take what part you plea&s;e
<PB N="88" REF="87">
at this hour, (I think you will take the be&s;t) your fir&s;t &s;ervices will never be forgotten by a grateful country. Adieu! Pre&s;ent my be&s;t re|gards to tho&s;e I know, and as many as I know in our country, I honour. There never was &s;o much ability, or, I believe, virtue, in it. They have a ta&s;k worthy of both. I doubt not they will perform it, for the &s;tability of the church and &s;tate, and for the union and the &s;eparation of the people: for the union of the hone&s;t and peaceable of all &s;ects; for their &s;eparation from all that is ill-intentioned and &s;editious in any of them.</P>
