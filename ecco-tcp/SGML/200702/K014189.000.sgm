I have a &s;trange Inclination to Woman-Hunting ever &s;ince I clamber'd over the Hou&s;e-top, and got to Bed to <HI>Moll</HI> at the next Door, through the Garret-Window.

<P>Truly, Sir, if your Wor&s;hip plea&s;|es, I had rather be the Carver's Man, than the Statue; for if the old Knight &s;hou'd find out a Trick, my Di&s;gui&s;e wou'd be &s;o heavy that I cou'd not run away, and he might chance to &s;hoot me thro' the Head with his Blunderbu&s;s.</P>

<P>It's impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hou'd &s;u|&s;pect thee. I &s;aw the Statue at the Stone-Cutter's, who told me, the old Gentleman expects it to be brought home every day, My painted Canvas is exactly copied from the Original, and the Pede&s;tal 'tis to be plac'd on in the Hall is &s;o high, that he won't be able to reach your Sides; or if he did, the Daub is &s;o hard and &s;o thick, 'twou'd deceive a nicer Touch than his I'll warrant thee.

<P>They are all drinking at the next Ale-hou&s;e, and the Gentleman who is to act the Statue in&s;tead of me, Sir, is a Man every Inch of him.
