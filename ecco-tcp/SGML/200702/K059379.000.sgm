<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH is the Pride and invin|cible Ob&s;tinacy of Mankind, that nothing is more again&s;t Nature than to <HI>acknowledge their mi&s;takes</HI>: Not the power of their Rea&s;on, not the &s;ence of Mode&s;ty, no not the influence of &s;ecret Con|victions can prevail with them ever to own them&s;elves <HI>in the wrong:</HI> No, altho' they know it, and di&s;cover to every own they conver&s;e with that they do &s;o. Hence the innumerable Writings of Men ob&s;tinate in error,
<PB N="2" REF="3">
have in a great mea&s;ure proceeded, and the World has been fill'd with the labours of <HI>Hereticks,</HI> who have in all Ages broach'd fal&s;e Doctrines, and infamous <HI>Opinions,</HI> even &s;o gro&s;s, as <HI>Satan</HI> him&s;elf never had the front to &s;ugge&s;t; and yet rather than be thought to recant what they had once advanc'd, they have thought fit to maintain tho&s;e fal&s;e Doctrines and infamous Opinions, at the expence of Religion, Con&s;cience, and all manner of Reputation.</P>
<P>This I take to be the Ca&s;e, in due proportion to Circum&s;tances, of the Author of the late Libel, entituled, the <HI>State Anatomy</HI>; &s;uch I mu&s;t call it, becau&s;e it Libels and Slanders Per|&s;ons, Governments, and Nations. And as this has long been his practi&s;e in other things, for which a certain Author of Note &s;aid of him, That he had made the World believe him a wor&s;e Heretick than he is: <HI>So</HI> I &s;ee a great deal of ground to think he has gone upon the &s;ame foundation in bringing forth now a &s;econd part of his Libel in vindication of the fir&s;t; notwith&s;tanding it is manife&s;t that he
<PB N="3" REF="4">
was &s;o convinc'd of the Error of the fir&s;t, that the very nature of the thing now, extorts a Confe&s;&s;ion, That he had been ju&s;tly reprov'd. An example of this (to make things clear as I go) is in nothing more evident than in the great bu&s;tle he makes in his &s;econd Libel, to clear him&s;elf of his having mo&s;t &s;candalou&s;ly fore&s;poken the Hou&s;e of Lords, telling us po&s;i|tively, before their Lord&s;hips had &s;o much as debated it, that they <HI>really would</HI> receive more Foreigners into their Body, and pointing out to them who &s;hould be the Men. This he will not have call'd <HI>leading</HI> or <HI>dictating</HI> to the Hou&s;e, tho' there are innumera|ble precedents when the Hou&s;e have thought otherwi&s;e, and re&s;ented it accordingly, as well from greater as &s;maller Per&s;ons than this Author.</P>
<P>This hard task however he under|takes, tho' mo&s;t People think he will as ill come off, as he did from en|deavouring to prove him&s;elf no He|retick, when yet he owns him&s;elf to be of &s;ome Opinions contrary to Ortho|dox Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">It is neverthele&s;s to be acknow|ledged to him (for I &s;hall do him ju&s;tice, tho' he does no ju&s;tice to others) I &s;ay, it is to be acknowledg'd to him, that he grants leading and dictating to &s;o illu&s;trious a Body as the Hou&s;e of Lords, is an unju&s;tifya|ble practi&s;e; but when he comes to wa&s;h his hands of the Fact, <HI>Hoc opus, Hic labor e&s;t</HI>: I &s;hall examine it by it &s;elf pre&s;ently; but before I enter up|on that part, it is meet to attack his <HI>detach'd Parties,</HI> which he has pre|par'd to Satyrize tho&s;e he intends to fight with; for it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that he takes a new method with Mankind, &s;carce ever practis'd by any Man before; and this is, to find out an Author who he thinks fit for his encounter, and call him the Writer of the Book which he contends with, (it matters not with him whether he is the Man or no) and thus having dre&s;t up this <HI>Man of Straw,</HI> he begins the fight. This he has done in the Ca&s;e before me, where finding it greatly for his purpo&s;e, that <HI>De Foe,</HI> Author of the <HI>True born Engli&s;hman,</HI> &s;hould pa&s;s for the Author of the <HI>Argument</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="6">
<HI>again&s;t enabling Foreigners,</HI> &amp;c. he has &s;ingled him out, and fallen upon him in a mo&s;t mercile&s;s manner; for he has recommended him to the Re|venge of his Foreigners, (what mercy he will find there may be gue&s;sd at.) He has al&s;o, as far as his good Wi&s;hes may have effect, recommended him to the Re&s;entment of the Government. He has expos'd, ridicul'd, banter'd, and in a word, as far as in him lies, murther'd the Man; and yet all this while, this Man, as I find, was no more Author of this Book than the Man in the Moon: Nay, <HI>as I hear,</HI> for I have no Knowledge of the Man, he has been &s;ick in his Bed all the while. In carrying on this <HI>Tragi co|medy,</HI> he takes care to &s;ummon for Evidence, all that this <HI>D. F.</HI> has &s;aid upon the &s;ame &s;ubject in his Pamphlets and Poems formerly writ|ten; and to confront this with what I have &s;aid now; whereas if it were true that the &s;aid <HI>D. F.</HI> had been Au|thor of all tho&s;e things, and tho&s;e too, it had amounted to no more than this; either that he had been <HI>wrong before,</HI> and was now <HI>better inform'd</HI>;
<PB N="6" REF="7">
or <HI>&s;econd,</HI> that he had contradicted him&s;elf, and wrote one time one thing, and one time another, a fault which Mode&s;ty &s;hould have taught <HI>Toland</HI> to have pa&s;s'd over in &s;ilence, that it might not be retorted upon him&s;elf; and after all, neither of the&s;e things would prove at all that what Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> had &s;aid was right, or would have made his Libel one jot better than it was before, be&s;ides the Scan|dal of having taken a wrong aim, and charging a Man fal&s;ly with wri|ting this Book, who really has no manner of concern in it or about it. In the next place, I ob&s;erve Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> is of Opinion that I &s;hould not have publi&s;h'd his Name when I an&s;wer'd his Libel: The Truth is, he &s;hould have taken care to have had the Secret better kept, knowing how ill his Name recommends any Cau&s;e he embarks in the defen&s;e of, and how much di&s;advantage it is to tho&s;e he &s;erves, to have him known to be their Advocate; upon the&s;e Con&s;i|derations I &s;hould have forborn his Name, had it not been made publick before by his Eccho, Mr. <HI>Boyer,</HI> who
<PB N="7" REF="8">
in his Monthly Fables, call'd fal&s;ly <HI>the Political State,</HI> harang'd for him, thinking (<HI>by mi&s;take</HI>) to make his Book &s;ell. This Man openly told his Name, for which, I hear, the Book|&s;eller <HI>ow'd him no thanks.</HI> Since then his own Friend did him that injury, for I hear it gave a great check to the &s;ale of his Book; why &s;hould he blame the Author of the <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> who only nam'd him at &s;econd Hand, after it was no more a Secret, and who, even then, did it with caution too, knowing how &s;candalous a &s;orger of Names to Books that &s;ame <HI>Boyer</HI> was, and how little was to be built <HI>for truth</HI> upon what he had publi&s;h'd, who is the ea&s;ie&s;t Man to be impos'd upon, the mo&s;t unconcern'd at doing any in|nocent Man an Injury, and the back|warde&s;t to do Ju&s;tice when he was convinc'd of it, of any Man alive; which I &s;hall prove in a part by it &s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A farther Confirmation of <HI>the vi&s;ible De&s;ign</HI> there has been for &s;ome time carry'd on among <HI>a Party</HI> to propo&s;e the Introducing <HI>FOREIGNERS</HI> among the Nobility; and a little of the Li|berty Mr. <HI>TOLAND</HI> takes with Truth.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MR. <HI>Toland</HI> begins this Subject for me with two notable <HI>Fal|&s;ities; fir&s;t he &s;ays boldly,</HI> Page 30. (the&s;e are his words) <HI>I never knew or heard of any &s;uch De&s;ign, as he affirms there was to introduce the&s;e two Noble|men or any other Foreigners into the Hou&s;e of Peers.</HI> Stop there, and go back to Page 26. &s;ee his words again, <HI>My propo&s;al,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>contains nothing</HI> new or &s;trange, <HI>with re&s;pect either to the Di&s;pen&s;ation or the</HI> Per&s;ons. How can this be if &s;uch a De&s;ign was ne|ver heard of before, <HI>Oportet Menda|cem.</HI> The next <HI>Fal&s;ity</HI> is as evident as the former, and is taken from his own words al&s;o, Page 25. (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>As to the two foreign Noblemen, in con&s;ideration of who&s;e &s;ervice, I propos'd a legal Di&s;pen|&s;ation with the fifth limitation of the</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="10">
<HI>Act of Succe&s;&s;ion, an out-cry was imme|diately rais'd, as if all the Foreigners in</HI> Chri&s;tendom <HI>were to be prefer'd here</HI>; whereas <HI>I expre&s;ly</HI> confin'd my Propo|&s;al <HI>to tho&s;e two Per&s;ons</HI>: Here again Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> lets us &s;ee <HI>that great Wits have &s;hort Memories</HI>; for either he did not write the Memorial call'd the <HI>Ana|tomy,</HI> or el&s;e he had forgot him&s;elf &s;trangely; for look into his &s;aid <HI>A|natomy,</HI> Page 57, he expre&s;ly recom|mends Mon&s;ieur <HI>Robethon</HI> by Name thus, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>nor can it enter into my Thoughts, but that a way will be found out to recompence the Merit of the no le&s;s able and indefatigable Mr.</HI> Robe|thon; there's <HI>one more</HI> plainly pro|pos'd by Name: And to let us &s;ee that even this is not all that is de&s;ired, <HI>he mode&s;tly adds,</HI> Page 58, <HI>I am far from extending this to</HI> many <HI>others,</HI> pray ob&s;erve, not to <HI>many others</HI>; this, I think, &s;trongly acknowledges he is for extending it <HI>to &s;ome few others</HI>: And yet this Man has the Front to &s;ay in his <HI>Second Part,</HI> Page 25. that he <HI>expre&s;ly confin'd his Propo&s;als to two Per&s;ons.</HI> Is this the Man that charges <HI>D. F.</HI> with fal&s;hood, and gives him
<PB N="10" REF="11">
the <HI>Lie</HI> in publick Print! was ever any thing more notorious! and is this the Man that di&s;owns their being <HI>a De&s;ign laid</HI> to propo&s;e the bringing in Foreigners! and <HI>more</HI> Foreigners than he names into the Peerage! whereas he here acknowledges there is a De|&s;ign to bring in &s;ome, but not <HI>many:</HI> Thus he confe&s;&s;es in one Book, and denies in the other; talks hone&s;tly <HI>per accident,</HI> and knavi&s;hly <HI>per inci|dent:</HI> But this is not the fir&s;t time Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> has di&s;cover'd him&s;elf to be <HI>Ambo dexter</HI> in his Arguments, as well as in other things; and tho' I will have nothing to do with the quarrel between <HI>D. F.</HI> and him, (for by his treating <HI>D. F.</HI> there mu&s;t be &s;ome Malice among them) yet when I am ob&s;erving the Liberty Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> takes with <HI>Truth,</HI> I cannot pa&s;s by one of the Cour&s;e&s;t Shuffles that I have ordinarily met with in the World. It is in his fighting with his Man of Straw afore&s;aid. After he has plaid the Buffoon with him a great while, as if he was bringing him in&s;tantly to the <HI>Old Bayly</HI> or <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> to be Arraign'd, and that he
<PB N="11" REF="12">
was to be the Informer again&s;t him, he then falls to down right giving him the <HI>Lie,</HI> as a Man who there was no mea&s;ures to be us'd with, and he proves <HI>D. F.</HI> a Lyar in this quaint method.</P>
<P>He complains that <HI>D. F.</HI> had &s;aid in &s;ome of his writings, that <HI>he had &s;een the original Letter which he</HI> (To|land) <HI>had &s;ent to the Di&s;&s;enters</HI>; this is a <HI>Lie</HI> &s;ays <HI>Toland,</HI> for it was only <HI>written by an Amanuen&s;is, I kept the original by me.</HI></P>
<P>Now would one not think that <HI>To|land</HI> might have learnt, ever &s;ince he was expell'd the Univer&s;ity, a little more ju&s;tice in Di&s;pute than this? Let his Enemy be who he will, real, or imaginary, I &s;hall only ask him in a few Words, <HI>whether,</HI> let it be written by a Servant or not by a Servant, <HI>was not the Letter which he actually &s;ent to the Di&s;&s;enting Mini&s;ters, properly the Original?</HI> I'll give him a particular Ca&s;e, (<HI>viz.</HI>) as in drawing Writings. The rough Draught of a Lea&s;e or <HI>In|denture</HI> is drawn by the Attorney or Scrivener, and it is afterwards writ|ten over fair or engro&s;s'd by a Clerk
<PB N="12" REF="13">
or <HI>Amanuen&s;is,</HI> yet that Ingro&s;sment <HI>being executed,</HI> is call'd the <HI>Original Deed,</HI> and it would be look'd upon a mo&s;t egregious Shuffle, for any Man who had &s;een the &s;aid Writing, to &s;ay, if he was <HI>legally ask'd,</HI> that he had not &s;een the <HI>Original</HI> becau&s;e he had not &s;een the <HI>Draught.</HI> If Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> drew a Draught of a Letter <HI>to the Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and then cau&s;ed his Servant or <HI>Amanuen&s;is</HI> to draw it out fair, <HI>The fir&s;t perhaps having alterations, in|terpolations,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>in it,</HI> and on view|ing the fair Copy, cau&s;ed his Name to be &s;et to it, which is Executing it, and then &s;ent away; I de&s;ire to know which is <HI>the Original,</HI> That which is fir&s;t fini&s;hed and executed, or that which is Drawn out rough, to be re|drawn out for &s;uch fini&s;hing?</P>
<P>But this is <HI>by</HI> the <HI>by</HI>: I Note it as a Specimen of his &s;incere way of Ar|guing, and his bold giving <HI>the LYE</HI> on &s;uch Grounds as the&s;e: And I have remarked this, that the World may &s;ee what Advocates &s;uch a Cau&s;e as this has &s;ingled out among Mankind to defend it.</P>
<Q><PB N="13" REF="14">
<L>Non tali auxilio, nec defen&s;oribus i&s;tis.</L>

<P>However I &s;hall &s;ay the le&s;s of this here, becau&s;e I may yet give a Com|pleater Hi&s;tory of the Character of this Mr. <HI>Toland,</HI> to undeceive the World about him, and al&s;o of his fel|low Labourer in this Drudgery; That <HI>French</HI> Papi&s;t in di&s;gui&s;e, who flattering every Side in his turn, Writes now for a Tory Mini&s;try, now for a Whig, and under the pretence of &s;er|ving the Whigs, has always been the fir&s;t to Publi&s;h the Manife&s;tos of Re|bels, Declarations of the Pretender, and &s;uch like &s;tuff, of whom I &s;ay, to|gether with an Account of Mr. <HI>To|land,</HI> the <HI>Publick,</HI> not the <HI>Secret Hi|story,</HI> is as ready for the Pre&s;s as need|ful for the Publick; and to which I &s;hall refer for the mo&s;t Execrable Practi&s;es that any have been &s;uffer'd to be guilty of unpuni&s;h'd in a Chri&s;tian Government.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of Leading, Dictating or Pre&s;cribing to the Hou&s;e of Lords, by the Pam|phlet call'd <HI>The State Anatomy.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOR the Rea&s;ons already Given, I leave for a while talking any more of the Per&s;on of this Author, and come back to his Di&s;cour&s;e; I find him very much concern'd to wa&s;h off what &s;ticks to him in this Article of <HI>Dictating to the Hou&s;e of Lords,</HI> it will &s;oon appear whether he does this to purpo&s;e, or not to purpo&s;e: I need &s;pend no time to prove that Leading and Dictating to the Hou&s;e of Lords, is a Scandalous, In&s;olent and Offen|&s;ive Practice, and what the Hou&s;e has always thought fit to re&s;ent; <HI>Toland</HI> has given me up that Point in his <HI>Se|cond Libel,</HI> which therefore according to my Title I mu&s;t Anatomi&s;e here. <HI>Pag.</HI> 5. his Words aae the&s;e: <HI>They mu&s;t be mad them&s;elves, who can think any Man el&s;e mad enough to pre&s;cribe to any Publick A&s;&s;embly, much le&s;s to the Le|gi&s;lative Body of the Nation?</HI> Thus
<PB N="15" REF="16">
the Point is Granted, and there needs no more di&s;pute about that: It lies then before us to enquire whether what Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> in his Lybel has of|fer'd to the <HI>Hou&s;e of Lords,</HI> can be call'd <HI>Dictating to them,</HI> and Leading them, or no.</P>
<P>I will abate him all he &s;ays, to re|commend the Gentlemen; This I will call only <HI>Propo&s;ing to the Lords,</HI> which he &s;ays any Man may do. But when he comes to &s;ay, there is no need to fear but that the Lords <HI>will do it,</HI> p. 57. and again, that it would <HI>&s;avour of Ingratitude and Partiallity not to do it,</HI> p. <HI>ibid.</HI> What &s;hall we &s;ay to that mode&s;t Part! Is this Pre&s;cribing to and Leading the Hou&s;e of Peers, or is it not?</P>
<P>Let me be allow'd to make a &s;hort Comment upon this worthy Text, <HI>The Hou&s;e of Lords will Con&s;ent to make Baron</HI> Bothmar <HI>and Count</HI> Bern&s;dorf Peers, they cannot Honourably refu&s;e it, and they would be ungrateful and unju&s;t, <HI>for to be Partial is to be &V;nju&s;t,</HI> if they &s;hould not. The&s;e are Words well de&s;erving to be Remark'd: I would be very glad to hear when ever
<PB N="16" REF="17">
&s;uch Words were &s;poken of the Hou&s;e of Lords and not re&s;ented; and yet <HI>this Man is not &s;o mad as to Dedicate to the Parliament</HI>&punc; as if telling them they mu&s;t do a Certain thing, <HI>or be &V;ngrateful</HI> and <HI>Partial,</HI> was not Dic|tating: For the farther a&s;&s;certaining then what <HI>is, or is not</HI> Dictating to the Hou&s;e, I appeal to that Illu&s;tri|ous and mo&s;t Honourable A&s;&s;embly, who&s;e Journals are full of Eminent Precedents, as well in Ca&s;es where Men have Offended in the Point of Dictating, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as al&s;o of the con|&s;tant re&s;entment of the Hou&s;e in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Has this mo&s;t Venerable Body been &s;o Jealous of their Privileges, and &s;o Nice, as to forbid any Lybeller or Author, &s;o much as to Print the Name of a Peer, and to make the Offender Lyable to an Action of <HI>Scan|dalum Magnatum,</HI> tho' he &s;aid nothing offen&s;ive; nay, tho' he &s;poke in the prai&s;e of the Per&s;on named: And &s;hall it not be an Offence again&s;t the Privileges of the Hou&s;e, to reproach them in Print with <HI>Ingratitude</HI> and <HI>Partiality,</HI> if they do not do this or
<PB N="17" REF="18">
that which the Libeller &s;ays is fit to be done!</P>
<P>Shall the Hou&s;e be &s;o Jealous of their Privileges, as to make a Fence round their Actions (like the Rails in ancient Times to keep off the People from approaching Mount <HI>Sinai</HI>) &s;o that Authors are forbid to Print and Write any thing that is &s;aid or done within their Walls at their Peril; and &s;hall it be no Subject of Re&s;entment to pretend, in Print, that they <HI>will certainly</HI> do this or that, before they have &s;o much as Debated it or &s;poken a Word about it? Is not Mr. <HI>Red|path</HI> and Mr. <HI>Walker,</HI> and others, now in Cu&s;tody of the <HI>Black Rod,</HI> for but an unwary Tre&s;pa&s;s of this kind; and &s;hall <HI>Toland</HI> publickly &s;ay they <HI>&s;hall or will</HI> do <HI>this or that,</HI> and <HI>cannot omit to do it without In|gratitude and Partiallity?</HI> and yet wipe his Mouth and &s;ay, <HI>He has given their Lord&s;hips no Offence.</HI></P>
<P>I will not &s;ay the Hou&s;e cannot o|mit taking him up without Partial|lity; but I may &s;ay, that if it were any body but Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> I &s;hould wonder at his Impudence, and &s;hould

a Judgment be made only by the Succe&s;s of the pre&s;ent Undertaking; and let Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> ask him&s;elf &s;e|dately, Whether he thinks that the Cau&s;e he has e&s;pou&s;ed has gain'd or lo&s;t by him?

<P>It cannot be true that he him&s;elf believes he has better'd their Cau&s;e; it appears that he thinks otherwi&s;e, by his &s;hifting off from them the Scandal of Employing him; taking the Blame of it all upon him&s;elf; de|claring they know nothing of it, and that they are &s;o far from de&s;iring him to do it, that they do not &s;o much as Court or De&s;ire the Honour of being Peers, or to that purpo&s;e. Now if he found, upon his &s;tarting the Propo&s;al, that the Nation came generally and readily into it, he would never &s;trive with &s;o much Earne&s;tne&s;s to conceal the De&s;ign; endeavour to bring in the Propo&s;al

as a Brat of his own private Con|jectures, hatch'd for not bodies par|ticular Intere&s;t, directed by no body, and only offered by a fortuitous Efflux of Thought, without the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance, or &s;o much as the Approba|tion, of the Per&s;ons named or point|ed at.</P>
<P><HI>If this were the Truth of the Story,</HI> he mu&s;t acknowledge him&s;elf mighty Officious, <HI>and that he has Run before he was Sent.</HI> I doubt he will find as few People to believe this Part, as he has found to approve the Propo&s;al it &s;elf: <HI>But be that as it will,</HI> if his pro|jected Scheme of Enobling the&s;e two Foreigners, with his Sugge&s;tion of <HI>one</HI> afterwards, <HI>which he names,</HI> and his <HI>not many others,</HI> which he &s;lily in&s;inuates are to follow; I &s;ay, if the Method he has taken to introduce the&s;e, has effected the Thing; if the Generality of the Nation approve the Propo&s;al, and he &s;ees the Game &s;ure before them; Why &s;hould they oblige him to acknowledge thus, that they di&s;own him and his Schemes?

But on the contrary, the Heads are pull'd back, no body cares to own him, and he him&s;elf applies diligent|ly to clear tho&s;e Noble Per&s;ons of ha|ving any hand in the Con&s;piracy with him, as indeed I believe he has rea&s;on to do.</P>
<P>No body cares to own a Plot when it has mi&s;carried; and if <HI>Toland</HI> de|&s;igned to do his Principals a Service by the Propo&s;al, if it had &s;ucceeded; he is the Hone&s;ter, and cannot be blam'd to do them a Service by keeping them out of it now it proves Abor|tive.</P>
<P>Perhaps he will &s;ay I triumph with|out a Victory, <HI>very like &s;o</HI>; but let him &s;peak for him&s;elf, whether it be a Victory or no; if he has the Victo|ry, if he is as &s;ure of the Succe&s;s as he thought him&s;elf at fir&s;t, why is he &s;o concern'd, and why does he keep &s;uch a Bu&s;tle to wa&s;h the Dirt off of any; and why &s;o apprehen&s;ive lea&s;t the World &s;hould think they were in the Con&s;piracy? Why &s;o forward to take all upon him&s;elf? I think I may, without any boa&s;ting, &s;ay, he has not &s;o good an Opinion of his Cau&s;e as he

had when he began it; let him deny it if he can.</P>
<P>Nor will the ful&s;ome Encomiums of a Vain <HI>French</HI> Scribbler a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this Point at all, I think I may venture to &s;ay, That all Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> has &s;aid in this Ca&s;e, has but &s;erved to make it more difficult than he found it; and the Gentlemen who he has named, <HI>if it is, as he &s;ays, without their Con&s;ent,</HI> no que&s;tion if they know what a Champion they have that has e&s;pous'd, <HI>in meer Knight Er|rantry,</HI> their Cau&s;e, would civilly de|&s;ire him <HI>to &s;ay no more about them.</HI></P>
<P>Now having brought it to the Que|&s;tion of his Succe&s;s, he joins I&s;&s;ue with him on his own Merit al&s;o; and then the remaining Que&s;tion in De|bate is, Whether has the De&s;ign mi&s;|carried by the &s;candalous Nature of the Propo&s;al, or by the &s;candalous Name of the Propo&s;er? Would ever Men of any Foreca&s;t have &s;ingled out a Man &s;candalous among Chri&s;tians, to have &s;tarted their Friends Cau&s;e into the World! He &s;ays he is not a <HI>Socinian,</HI> and perhaps he may not be to now; but let him tell them what
<PB N="23" REF="24">
he was Expelled the Univer&s;ity of &mdash; for, and how he comes to ob|tain the general Title of a Heretick in Principles, if he had given no oc|ca&s;ion for it? <HI>Not that Reproach al|ways argues Guilt,</HI> but let him tell the World him&s;elf the occa&s;ion if he thinks fit; I forbear it, becau&s;e it is not the pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s; I &s;hall find another Time for it.</P>
<P>As to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, I cannot but ob&s;erve how I have heard many People who were not much con|cern'd to enquire about it before, &s;tart at the Propo&s;al now, becau&s;e it is handed into the World by &s;uch an Agent; and I leave it to univer&s;al Judgment, whether the Manner, the arrogant Manner of propo&s;ing it, has not ju&s;tly &s;hock'd the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>England,</HI> as to the Propo|&s;al it &s;elf; to have them told <HI>they will do it</HI> before they were ever &s;o much as asked! To have them told it will <HI>&s;avour of Ingratitude and Partiallity not to do it,</HI> before ever they &s;o much as denied! Is not this Bullying the Peers into it?

the Ca&s;e better than it was, or has not rather ju&s;tly filled many Minds with Re&s;entment, who were neither prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed one way or o|ther, let any rea&s;onable Per&s;on de|termine.</P>
<P>In the mean time I can a&s;&s;ure him, it is a very great Satisfaction to many good and impartial Men, that this De&s;ign of propo&s;ing the breaking down the Pale of our Nobility, is thus Detected and Expo&s;ed: But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that when &s;ome Gen|tlemen came to me the other Day, and gave me thanks for the Service I had done, in &s;etting it out in &s;o clear a Light as is done in the <HI>Argument, &amp;c.</HI> I told them frankly the Thanks were all due to Mr. <HI>Toland,</HI> who by &s;o in|&s;olent an Attempt, had ju&s;tly alarm'd and open'd the Eyes of almo&s;t as ma|ny as had read his Libel; and had e|ven <HI>in denying,</HI> proved effectually that this Propo&s;al of his was <HI>no new Thing</HI></P>
<P><HI>No indeed,</HI> it has been no new Thing either, that &s;ome Per&s;ons aimed at being &s;o Enobled, or that a Party aimed at complying, <HI>and</HI>

<PB N="27" REF="28">
while this is at the Pre&s;s, a particu|lar Account of that Part would be given: But it is none of my bu&s;ine&s;s to vindicate <HI>De Foe</HI> however injuri|ou&s;ly he may be treated; all I have to &s;ay is, That if Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> is di&s;po|&s;ed to make Honourable Amends for the in&s;olent Language which he gives <HI>ME,</HI> under the Cover of Charging the Work upon a Fellow that neither He nor I know any thing of, he &s;hall at any time have the Occa&s;ion to know who is not Concern'd in this Work, by knowing Face to Face who is Concern'd in it: And I &s;ay the &s;ame to that Cowardly <HI>Frenchman Boyer</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>I repeat again what I have &s;aid, That there is not the lea&s;t De&s;ign or Intention of Di&s;re&s;pect to the Per&s;on or Government of <HI>King George</HI> in all my An&s;wer to <HI>Toland</HI>'s Lybel, but a &s;ingle and di&s;intere&s;ted Zeal for the Liberties of my Country: I Honour with the profounde&s;t Duty, not the King only as on the Throne, but all his Royal Po&s;terity, and Raee, as Ca|pable of, and De&s;ign'd by Heaven to Reign in their Cour&s;es of time; and
<PB N="28" REF="29">
yet it is no impeachment of this Duty and Zeal, <HI>to &s;ay,</HI> that from the be&s;t of Kings have proceeded the wor&s;t of Tyrants: Our Laws are made as Fen|ces and Securities, not again&s;t good, but bad Kings. Were the Divine Ge|nius to be Immortal, as I &s;aid in the <HI>Argument,</HI> were all the Kings who &s;hall proceed from the Loyns of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, to Inherit King <HI>George</HI>'s Principles, his Ju&s;tice, Mo|deration, Love to his People, and Knowledge as well as De&s;ire of their Wellfare and Pro&s;perity; I would be as Ea&s;ie to give up all our Con&s;titu|tion to him, and to be Governed by his meer Will and Di&s;cretion, as I would be to any Man that ever wore a Crown.</P>
<P>But as Vertue, Honour, Probity, Wi&s;dom, Judgment, do not de&s;cend by Inheritance, and are no Entail with the Crown, but Kings may hereafter ari&s;e that <HI>knew not Jo&s;eph</HI>; it is a Du|ty to our Po&s;terity, that we endea|vour to pre&s;erve the Fences of our Liberties unbroken, and hand forward tho&s;e invaluable Rights to our Chil|dren,

Entire as we Receive them.</P>
<P>But this Mercenary, this bringer of a Railing Accu&s;ation, he is for break|ing down this Fence, and di&s;pen&s;ing with this Law, making a precedent to &s;erve a pre&s;ent <HI>Turn,</HI> and <HI>Party,</HI> which may hereafter be an Argument to bring in all the In&s;truments of Tyran|ny, which an Arbitrary unguided Prince may &s;tand in need of, for the De&s;truction of the Kingdom; and this, tho', <HI>as I &s;aid before, without the lea&s;t de&s;ign'd Reflection,</HI> they were of any Nation or Religion, even <HI>Turks,</HI> and <HI>Mahometans</HI>; whether tho&s;e who are for thus breaking in upon our Con&s;ti|tution to gratify <HI>Foreigners,</HI> or they who are for pre&s;erving our Con&s;titu|tion whole and unbroken, are the be&s;t Patriots, let impartial Po&s;terity in|quire.</P>
<P>Nor am I in this, offering in the lea&s;t to derogate from the ju&s;t E&s;teem due to the Honourable Per&s;ons who he mentions; <HI>but I ask him this Que|&s;tion,</HI> Is there no Reward can be &s;uit|able to the Character and Merit of tho&s;e Gentlemen, but that of being made Lords?

lo&s;s, and is the Kingdom of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> empty of means to Reward the&s;e Per&s;ons however great their Merit? Is there no way to make them amends but this one Method?

<PB N="31" REF="32">
Reward tho&s;e Eminent Services &s;ome other way; and I dare &s;ay, the Po&s;te|rity of that Noble Per&s;on do not Complain of the King's being unkind to them.</P>
<P>I am ready to grant that the Servi|ces of the&s;e Noble Per&s;ons now Pro|pos'd, are as great as my Oppo&s;er plea&s;es to &s;uppo&s;e them; yet I &s;ay, without le&s;&s;ening tho&s;e Suppo&s;itions, That <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is able to Reward them fully, tho' they are not receiv'd into our Peerage, and yet not merit to be Libell'd by <HI>Toland</HI> as partial and ungrateful.</P>
<P><HI>But be that as it will,</HI> Let His Ma|je&s;ty propo&s;e to his Parliament what he thinks fit, the Parliament will al|ways act as becomes them; the Hou&s;e of Peers will never act undutifully to the King, <HI>no,</HI> not in tho&s;e things which they cannot Grant; nor will they act unfaithfully to their Country, <HI>no,</HI> not in tho&s;e things which they cannot Refu&s;e: But this is not to the Ca&s;e in hand; for it does not appear that the King has any de&s;ire to have this thing done; nay, Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> does not pretend to it:
<PB N="32" REF="33">
But let us &s;ee here how the vain Man expo&s;es him&s;elf; for while he acknowleges no body to be privy to the Propo&s;al but him&s;elf, he Contra|dicts and Confounds him&s;elf mo&s;t pitiou&s;ly; He prote&s;ts, pa. 30. <HI>That he never knew or heard of any De&s;ign to introduce tho&s;e two Noble Men, or any other Foreigners into the Hou&s;e of Peers, Exore tuo:</HI> Call Mr. <HI>Toland</HI> to detect Mr. <HI>Toland,</HI> pa. 26. <HI>My Propo&s;al Con|tain'd nothing NEW with Re&s;pect either to the Thing, or to the Per&s;ons</HI>; the&s;e are the Words quoted before, but are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be brought in again here, becau&s;e this Man can have the A&s;&s;urance to pre|tend after this, to be believ'd upon his Word, That no body ever heard of this before.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hould believe him for once, and imagine that neither the King intended to Enoble the&s;e Per&s;ons, that the&s;e two Per&s;ons did not de&s;ire to be Enobled, or that the Hou&s;e of Peers ever intended to Re|peal or Di&s;pence with the Act for this End; How then can he have the Front to tell the Hou&s;e of Peers to
<PB N="33" REF="34">
their Faces, that if they do not do it, <HI>it &s;avours of Ingratitude and Partia|lity?</HI> He may be defy'd to &s;how an Impudence like this, &s;ince the Liber|ty of the Pre&s;s, which we now groan under, has Plagu'd us: I am &s;orry to u&s;e &s;uch Words in Print, but when we are talking to &s;uch Men, &s;uch Lan|guage is forc'd out of our Mouths as only proper to People of &s;uch Flagrant Merit.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> If neither the King, the Hou&s;e of Lords, or the two foreign Noblemen them&s;elves, have &s;o much as had any Thoughts of this matter, how will this <HI>fal&s;e Accu&s;er</HI> make good his Charge, that the oppo&s;ing it, is pointed at the Government, or the Mini&s;try? The Charge is pointed at tho&s;e Con&s;pirators who are in the De&s;ign, and as he declares, neither the King, the Mini&s;try, or the Parlia|ment are acquainted with it, then they are not pointed at: But we know who are in it perhaps better than he pretends to know, and as they are not too big to be charg'd, &s;o I mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ell him it is not his Raillery, and
<PB N="34" REF="35">
pretending it Points at the Govern|ment, who are not concern'd in it, that will wipe it off.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is <HI>in &s;hort</HI> this, the De&s;ign is blown, the Plot is di&s;cover'd, and thereby defeated; he thought it was Ripe before it was &s;o, and brought it out too &s;oon: He knows it well e|nough, for his own Friends blame him for it, and now he has no Re|medy, but to cry out <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI> and <HI>Trea&s;on</HI> in his oppo&s;ers, as if all the Men who are not for recommending <HI>Foreigners</HI> to the Nobility mu&s;t be <HI>Jacobites</HI>; or that all tho&s;e who were not for a <HI>Standing-Army</HI> in time of Peace were for the Pretender; and yet he confe&s;&s;es that I declar'd I was for an Army when there was any Danger of the Pretender, and while either a foreign Enemy or private Di&s;turbance threatned the Country.</P>
<P>But the Man is enrag'd becau&s;e he is fru&s;trated: He had &s;aid the Hou&s;e of Lords <HI>will</HI> open the Door to Fo|reigners, and now he is a&s;&s;ur'd they <HI>wont</HI>; nay, he knows he may with much more title to mode&s;ty &s;ay <HI>they</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="36">
<HI>will not,</HI> than he could before &s;ay <HI>they will</HI>; and this makes him raving at every body that comes in his way.</P>
<P>But let him Rave, the Nation is awake. <HI>Britains</HI> may be &s;urpriz'd into &s;uch things as may be dangerous in their Examples <HI>like this,</HI> but <HI>in vain is the Net &s;pread in the &s;ight of any Bird</HI>; while they are awake, and there Eyes are open, they are in no Danger.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve that this <HI>Toland</HI> makes him&s;elf merry with <HI>De Foe</HI>'s Ver&s;es from <HI>The True born Engli&s;hman:</HI> I have only this to &s;ay in that Ca&s;e, that if that Satyr was Ju&s;t upon our Country and Nobility, it certainly in|fers, that as we are now arriv'd to an Excellence which we believe is not <HI>out-done</HI> by other Nations, either in Science or Religion, and moral Virtue, <HI>we &s;hould keep were we are,</HI> and mix no farther <HI>if we can help it,</HI> unle&s;s we are &s;ure to improve; <HI>but to let that go for a je&s;t, as it was intended,</HI> our bu&s;ine&s;s is not now &s;o much about mixing of Blood, <HI>tho' that is not in&s;ignificant,</HI> but about mixing our Politicks: The Ar|gument which I brought from the

<P><PB N="39" REF="40">But not to re&s;ume the Debates of tho&s;e Days, &s;eeing he puts me to it, I &s;hall &s;tart another Ca&s;e as new as the former, and yet as pungent as can be de&s;ired to the pre&s;ent point of ad|mitting Foreigners: At the time of the <HI>Treaty of &V;nion,</HI> notwith&s;tand|ing the whole <HI>Scots</HI> Nation was to be incorporated into one body with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and that the Subjects of both were to enjoy <HI>equal Priviledges,</HI> yet &s;o re&s;olutely did our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> No|bility in&s;i&s;t upon not encorporating the Peerage of <HI>Scotland</HI> with them|&s;elves, &s;o jealous were they of pul|ling down the Fence about their own incommunicable Judicature, that the Union is &s;aid, not to allow even the Crown it &s;elf to create a <HI>Scots</HI> Peer, <HI>already a Peer,</HI> a Lord by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Title, &s;o as to make him <HI>an Heredita|ry Lord of Parliament.</HI> This is emi|nent in the Ca&s;e of the late Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> as Duke of <HI>Brandon</HI>; and albeit the <HI>Scots</HI> do di&s;pute this Point, we do not find the Hou&s;e of Lords take yet any notice of that Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>And &s;hall this Libeller tell us, the Hou&s;e of Peers will be <HI>Partial</HI> and
<PB N="40" REF="41">
<HI>&V;ngrateful</HI> if they admit not <HI>Ger|mans</HI> and Strangers into their Body; while at the &s;ame time they have barr'd the Door again&s;t their own en|corporated Brethren of <HI>Scotland?</HI> Let <HI>Toland</HI> or any of the Con&s;pira|tors <HI>tell us</HI> what was the Rea&s;on of this nicety, if it was not that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility had &s;een Rea&s;on to think they ought to be exceeding cautious of ever making more mix|tures, <HI>by Creation at lea&s;t,</HI> with the Blood of their Nobility: Rather let him prove that it would not be <HI>Par|tial</HI> and <HI>&V;ngrateful</HI> to the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobi|lity, if Foreigners &s;hould be receiv'd, while the <HI>Scots</HI> are excluded; and where is the general kindne&s;s which was promis'd, and <HI>exhorted to from the</HI> Throne to be pre&s;erv'd and culti|vated between the two united King|doms; I &s;ay, where is this mutual kindne&s;s, if &s;uch Partiality &s;hould be practis'd on our Side?</P>
<P>If indeed an <HI>encorporate &V;nion</HI> &s;hall come to be treated between his Ma|je&s;ty's Foreign Dominions and the I&s;land of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> then the Ca&s;e will be alter'd, and we &s;hould be all
<PB N="41" REF="42">
willing and ready, <HI>no doubt,</HI> to receive a Repre&s;entative of the <HI>Hanover Nobility</HI> into the Body of ours, &s;uch as to the King and Parliament &s;hall &s;eem convenient: But as to the Enno|bling Foreigners, it is firmly Provided again&s;t by the Con&s;titution, and our <HI>Libel-maker</HI> Pro&s;e&s;&s;es that neither does he know that his Maje&s;ty intends it, or the&s;e Foreign Noble Per&s;ons, who <HI>he has pre&s;um'd to Name,</HI> de&s;ire it; I am &s;ure the Hou&s;e of Peers have not Debated it. What A&s;&s;urance then mu&s;t He, and the Party who Dictate to him, who for that Rea&s;on I ju&s;tly call Con&s;pirators, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> what a&s;&s;u|rance mu&s;t they have, to be Officious in a thing of this Con&s;equence to their Country!</P>
<P>It has been &s;ugge&s;ted, and I have Rea&s;on to believe it is &s;o far true, that the thing is in its <HI>Embrio,</HI> that the Scheme is young, and that the Peo|ple concern'd were willing to let the Propo&s;al take wind, <HI>this way,</HI> to &s;ee how it would Reli&s;h with the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Gentry, and it was no imprudent &s;tep I acknowledge to do &s;o; for had they made the attempt at once, be|fore
<PB N="42" REF="43">
they had made a judgment of things, they would have run the ha|zard of a Mi&s;carriage much more to their Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P><HI>Be it as it will,</HI> they have now made the Experiment, and I dare &s;ay they will not find, upon telling No&s;es, that they have made one Convert by Mr. <HI>Toland</HI>'s <HI>Anatomy</HI>; on the contra|ry, there are &s;ome te&s;timony of many Eyes being opened, by the Detecting and ju&s;tly Expo&s;ing the Traiterous Contrivance; and I leave them to the Tryal, when they will find the Per&s;ons Concern'd in another Condi|tion to Repel them than perhaps they expected.</P>
<P>It might be worth while to note here, how Quaintly he would make it Criminal in me, to &s;peak of SOME <HI>Hone&s;t and Loyal Patriots REMAIN|ING in the Admini&s;tration,</HI> as if I thereby in&s;inuated that <HI>&s;ome there</HI> were otherwi&s;e, and that there were <HI>mi&s;|under&s;tandings</HI> among&s;t the Mini&s;try; That I would have it thought they were not all of a Piece, and he would have this be thought Mali|cious. Now, by what has &s;ince hap|ned
<PB N="43" REF="44">
in the Mini&s;try, it may be asked without any Reflection, whether, if I had look'd that way, <HI>tho' that is not granted,</HI> I were in the Right or not?

<P>All the re&s;idue of his Book, <HI>viz.</HI> His An&s;wer to the Clergy-man, his Letters to the Arch-bi&s;hop, and to the Di&s;&s;enters, and his wrangling and un&s;eemly Language upon <HI>De Foe,</HI> are worth no Notice at all, either by me, or any one el&s;e: Perhaps &s;uch Lan|guage may be &s;uitable to the Foreign <HI>Noble Lord without a Name,</HI> who he pretends to write to, and who, <HI>if he be any body,</HI> it's like is one of the <HI>not many more,</HI> who he pretends to &s;olli|cit for after the&s;e are got in, and who are <HI>all</HI> to be <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Peers, <HI>ad Graecos Calendas.</HI></P>
