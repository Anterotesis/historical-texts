<HEAD><HI>The Vi&s;ion,</HI> A POEM. Being an ANSWER to the Lord <HI>Beilhaven</HI>'s SPEECH.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By a Per&s;on of Quality.</BYLINE>
<L>COme hither ye Dreamers of Dreams,</L>
<L>Ye Sooth&s;ayers, Vizards and Witches,</L>
<L>That puzzle the World with hard Names,</L>
<L>And without any meaning make Speeches:</L>
<L>Here's a Lord in the North,</L>
<L>Near <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Frith;</L>
<L>Tho little has been &s;aid of his Name or his Worth;</L>
<L>He's &s;een &s;uch a Vi&s;ion, no Mortal can reach it,</L>
<L>I challenge the Clan of <HI>Egyptians</HI> to match it.</L>
<L>And fir&s;t, in the dark it was told him,</L>
<L>Which might very well appall us,</L>
<L>That the World was a fighting of old time,</L>
<L>From <HI>Nimrod</HI> to <HI>Sardanapalus</HI>;</L>
<L>That it's all Revelation,</L>
<L>You may pawn your Salvation,</L>
<L>For the Devil a Hi&s;tory gives the relation,</L>
<L>But it's all in the Deeps, no Mortal can reach it,</L>
<L>We may challenge the Clan of <HI>Egyptians</HI> to match it,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="2">Then <HI>Scotland</HI> comes next on the Stage,</L>
<L>For in Vi&s;ions you mu&s;t not be nice,</L>
<L>And a skip of three thou&s;and Years age,</L>
<L>Is nothing where Men are Conci&s;e;</L>
<L>I name it the rather</L>
<L>Becau&s;e you may gather,</L>
<L>How that every Man is the Son of his Father,</L>
<L>A Truth for the future no Mortal can doubt,</L>
<L>Whatever they might, before he found it out.</L>
<L>But heark, now the Wonders begin,</L>
<L>And take care lea&s;t the Vi&s;ion &s;hould fright ye;</L>
<L>For if it &s;hould make you unclean,</L>
<L>He has not told how he would dight ye.</L>
<L>Fir&s;t the National Church,</L>
<L>Left quite in the Lurch,</L>
<L>Was a truckling down to the Steeple and Porch,</L>
<L>But what is &s;till wor&s;e, &s;he's afraid of her Friends,</L>
<L>So Fevers make frantick Men-ha&s;ten their Ends.</L>
<L>Was ever &s;uch Conjuring known,</L>
<L>Or the Church &s;o claw'd by the Steeple,</L>
<L>Non-jurors are her Champions grown,</L>
<L>And the Prelati&s;ts vote for the People.</L>
<L>Prote&s;ters appear</L>
<L>And the <HI>Jacques</HI> they adhere,</L>
<L>And Anti-chri&s;t votes the true Church to &s;ecure,</L>
<L>O <HI>Scotland!</HI> Was ever &s;uch Conjuring known,</L>
<L>That the Mitre &s;upports the &s;ame Church pull'd her down.</L>
<L>Then the Nation in Sack-cloth appear'd,</L>
<L>And the Vi&s;ione&s;t &s;adly bewail'd her,</L>
<L>For Mi&s;chiefs the like were ne'er heard,</L>
<L>Her Priv'lege of Slavery fail'd her.</L>
<L>For the Mob he complain'd</L>
<L>That being born Chain'd,</L>
<L>Ble&s;t Bondage was lo&s;t, and damn'd Freedom remain'd,</L>
<L>So with Liberty &s;car'd, and afraid to grow Rich;</L>
<L>They &s;u'd for Repentance in a dolorous Speech.</L>
<L>And fir&s;t our Amazement 'll increa&s;e.</L>
<L>The Souldiers disbanded appear,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3">Poor Drudges put Prentices to Peace,</L>
<L>For want of the Ble&s;&s;ings of War;</L>
<L>For tho it's in the Book,</L>
<L>Yet the Scripture mi&s;took,</L>
<L>When it told us, our Swords &s;hould to Plow-&s;hares be broke:</L>
<L>It might be long ago a Happine&s;s there,</L>
<L>But it's plain by the Vi&s;ion it's otherwi&s;e here.</L>
<L>The Merchants are next on the Stage;</L>
<L>The Enchantment has circl'd them in;</L>
<L>For fear they in Wealth &s;hould engage,</L>
<L>They re&s;olve they'll never begin</L>
<L>The Burghs are afraid</L>
<L>They &s;hall have too much Trade,</L>
<L>And the Nation to Plenty be &s;afely betray'd,</L>
<L>So they gravely Addre&s;s, that to keep them &s;ecure,</L>
<L>As you find them, you leave them, both Fooli&s;h and Poor.</L>
<L>The next is indeed a &s;ad Sight,</L>
<L>The like on't has rarely been known,</L>
<L>'Twill ruin the Country quite,</L>
<L>It will never recover its own;</L>
<L>The Plow Man's undone,</L>
<L>From Father to Son;</L>
<L>For a terrible draw-back on Corn will come on,</L>
<L>In plenty they'll Ship it, be there never &s;o much;</L>
<L>And to load us with Money, &s;ell all to the <HI>Dutch.</HI></L>
<L>O ye Virgins! (both Sexes) draw near,</L>
<L>And tho it's but in Spectrum &s;howen,</L>
<L>In &s;ympathy lend us a Tear,</L>
<L>As the Ca&s;e may &s;ometime be your own;</L>
<L>The Ladies Condition</L>
<L>De&s;erves your Compa&s;&s;ion;</L>
<L>'Tis very &s;evere to make Beauty petition:</L>
<L>Yet here his &s;trange Tragedies turn'd to a Jigg,</L>
<L>That the Men want Employments, yet the Ladies &s;hou'd Beg.</L>
<L>Then a Crew of old Sailers were brought,</L>
<L>At their true Benefactors to Rail;</L>
<L>Their Freight for &s;trange Nations was bought,</L>
<L>And this will cut off the Entail;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4">They thought it was hard</L>
<L>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships to di&s;card,</L>
<L>And to force the poor <HI>Scots</HI> their own Trade to regard,</L>
<L>For Liberty claims a Freedom to ill,</L>
<L>And it's hard to get Money again&s;t a Man's Will</L>
<L>And now the Exorci&s;t in turn</L>
<L>Like a Gho&s;t in a Circle ari&s;es,</L>
<L>Without any Tears he can mourn.</L>
<L>He is Exta&s;ies all and Surpri&s;es.</L>
<L>But what's wilde&s;t of all,</L>
<L>And does &s;trangely appall,</L>
<L>Two hours he talk'd, and &s;aid nothing at all:</L>
<L>But let drop a few hypocritical Tears,</L>
<L>So the Crocodale weeps on the Carca&s;e &s;he tears;</L>
<L>Then in &s;trange Hebrew words he bewail'd ye,</L>
<L>Tho the Je&s;t was by few under&s;tood,</L>
<L><HI>Tu quoque mi fili Squadrone,</HI></L>
<L>Or in Scots, <HI>the Parliament</HI>'s <HI>wood,</HI></L>
<L>So <HI>Coe&s;ar</HI> they &s;ay,</L>
<L>Cry'd out in a fray,</L>
<L>When they kill'd him, becau&s;e he'd his Country betray,</L>
<L>For <HI>Brutus</HI> his Country's Liberty &s;ought,</L>
<L>Was a Simily e're-&s;oon happily brought?</L>
<L>Thus he rummag'd the Hi&s;tories old,</L>
<L>Like the Tale of the Bear, and the Fiddle;</L>
<L>For as 'twas unluckily told,</L>
<L>So the Story broke off in the middle.</L>
<L>Some &s;aid my Lord cry'd,</L>
<L>Tho others deny'd;</L>
<L>Which Matter of Moment it's hard to decide,</L>
<L>But here's a more difficult Matter remains,</L>
<L>To tell if he &s;hew'd us le&s;s Manners or Brains.</L>
