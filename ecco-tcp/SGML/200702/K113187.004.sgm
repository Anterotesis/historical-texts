<P>MORE poetry was written in the &s;ingle reign of Elizabeth, than in the two preceding centuries. The &s;ame cau&s;es, among others already enumerated and explained, which called forth genius and imagination, &s;uch as the new &s;ources of fiction opened by a &s;tudy of the cla&s;&s;ics, a familiarity with the French Italian and Spani&s;h writers, the growing elegancies of the Engli&s;h language, the diffu&s;ion of poli&s;hed manners, the felicities of long peace and public pro&s;|perity, and a certain freedom and activity of mind which im|mediately followed the national emancipation from &s;uper&s;tition, contributed al&s;o to produce innumerable compo&s;itions in poetry. In pro&s;ecuting my further examination of the poetical annals of this reign, it there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ore becomes nece&s;&s;ary to reduce &s;uch a latitude of materials to &s;ome &s;ort of methodical arrangement. On which account, I &s;hall cla&s;s and con&s;ider the poets of this reign, under the general heads, or divi&s;ions, of SATIRE, SON|NET, PASTORAL, and MISCELLANEOUS poetry. Spen&s;er will &s;tand alone, without a cla&s;s, and without a rival.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="2">
Satire, &s;pecifically &s;o called, did not commence in England till the latter end of the reign of queen Elizabeth. We have &s;een, indeed, that eclogues, and allegories were made the vehicle of &s;atire, and that many poems of a &s;atirical tendency had been publi&s;hed, long ago. And here, the cen&s;ure was rather confined to the corruptions of the clergy, than extended to popular follies and vices. But the fir&s;t profe&s;&s;ed Engli&s;h &s;atiri&s;t, to &s;peak technically, is bi&s;hop Jo&s;eph Hall, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly bi&s;hop of Exeter and Norwich, born at Bri&s;tow-park within the pari&s;h of A&s;hby de la Zouch in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, in the year 1574, and at the age of fifteen, in the year 1588, admitted into Emanuel-college at Cambridge, where he remained about eight years. He &s;oon became eminent in the theology of tho&s;e times, preached again&s;t prede&s;tination before prince Henry with unrivalled applau&s;e, and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the doctrines of Armi|niani&s;m in voluminous di&s;&s;ertations. But &s;o variable are our &s;tudies, and &s;o fickle is opinion, that the poet is better known to po&s;terity than the prelate or the polemic. His &s;atires have outlived his &s;ermons at court, and his laborious confutations of the Browni&s;ts. One of his later controver&s;ial tracts is, however, remembered on account of the celebrity of its an|tagoni&s;t. When Milton de&s;cended from his dignity to plead the cau&s;e of fanatici&s;m and ideal liberty, bi&s;hop Hall was the defender of our hierarchical e&s;tabli&s;hment. Bayle, who knew Hall only as a theologi&s;t, &s;eems to have written his life merely becau&s;e he was one of the Engli&s;h divines at the Synod of Dort, in 1618. From his inflexible and con&s;cientious attach|ment to the royal and epi&s;copal cau&s;e under king Charles the fir&s;t, he &s;uffered in his old age the &s;everities of impri&s;onment and &s;eque&s;tration; and lived to &s;ee his cathedral converted into a barrack, and his palace into an ale-hou&s;e. His uncommon learning was meliorated with great penetration and knowledge of the world, and his mildne&s;s of manners and his humility were characteri&s;tical. He died, and was ob&s;curely buried with|out a memorial on his grave, in 1656, and in his eighty &s;econd
<PB N="3" REF="3">
year, at Heigham a &s;mall village near Norwich, where he had &s;ought &s;helter from the &s;torms of u&s;urpation, and the intole|rance of pre&s;byteriani&s;m.</P>
<P>I have had the good fortune to &s;ee bi&s;hop Hall's funeral|&s;ermon, preached &s;ome days after his interment, on the thir|tieth day of September, 1656, at &s;aint Peter's church in Nor|wich, by one John Whitefoote, Ma&s;ter of Arts, and rector of Heigham. The preacher, no contemptible orator, before he proceeds to draw a parallel between our prelate and the pa|triarch I&s;rael, thus illu&s;trates that part of his character with which we are chiefly concerned, and which I am now ha&s;ten|ing to con&s;ider. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Two yeares together he was cho&s;en rheto|rick profe&s;&s;or in the univer&s;itie of Cambridge, and perform|ed the office with extraordinary applau&s;e. He was noted for a &s;ingular wit from his youth: a mo&s;t acute rhetorician, and an elegant poet. He under&s;tood many tongues; and in the rhetorick of his own, he was &s;econd to none that lived in his time <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fol. 3.</NOTE>."</Q> It is much to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, that the &s;tyle of his pro&s;e is &s;trongly tinctured with the man|ner of Seneca. The writer of the &s;atires is perceptible in &s;ome of his grave&s;t polemical or &s;criptural treati&s;es; which are per|petually inter&s;per&s;ed with excur&s;ive illu&s;trations, familiar allu&s;ions, and ob&s;ervations on life. Many of them were early tran&s;lated into French; and their character is well drawn by him&s;elf, in a dedication to James the fir&s;t, who perhaps would have much better reli&s;hed a more &s;edate and profound theology. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Seldome any man hath offered to your royall hands a greater bundle of his owne thoughts, nor perhaps more varietie of di&s;cour&s;e.

At the age of twenty-three, while a &s;tudent at Emanuel|college, and in the year 1597, he publi&s;hed at London three Books of anonymous Satires, which he called <HI>Toothle&s;s</HI> SATYRS, <HI>poetical, academical, moral</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In &s;mall duodecimo, Wh.

By VIR|GIDEMIA, an uncouth and uncommon word, we are to under|&s;tand a Gathering or Harve&s;t of rods, in reference to the nature of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;atires are marked with a cla&s;&s;ical preci&s;ion, to which Engli&s;h poetry had yet rarely attained. They are replete with animation of &s;tyle and &s;entiment. The indignation of the &s;atiri&s;t is always the re&s;ult of good &s;en&s;e. Nor are the thorns of &s;evere invective unmixed with the flowers of pure poetry. The characters are delineated in &s;trong and lively colouring, and their di&s;criminations are touched with the ma&s;terly traces of genuine humour. The ver&s;ification is equally energetic and elegant, and the fabric of the couplets approaches to the mo|dern &s;tandard. It is no incon&s;iderable proof of a genius pre|dominating over the general ta&s;te of an age when every preacher was a pun&s;ter, to have written ver&s;es, where laughter was to be rai&s;ed, and the reader to be entertained with &s;allies of plea&s;antry, without quibbles and conceits. His chief fault is ob&s;curity, ari&s;ing from a remote phra&s;eology, con&s;trained combinations, unfamiliar allu&s;ions, elleiptical apo&s;trophes, and abruptne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion. Perhaps &s;ome will think, that his manner betrays too much of the laborious exactne&s;s and pe|dantic anxiety of the &s;cholar and the &s;tudent. Ario&s;to in Ita|lian, and Regnier in French, were now almo&s;t the only mo|dern writers of &s;atire: and I believe there had been an Eng|li&s;h tran&s;lation of Ario&s;to's &s;atires. But Hall's acknowledged patterns are Juvenal and Per&s;ius, not without &s;ome touches of
<PB N="6" REF="6">
the urbanity of Horace. His parodies of the&s;e poets, or rather his adaptations of antient to modern manners, a mode of imitation not unhappily practiced by Oldham, Ro|che&s;ter, and Pope, di&s;cover great facility and dexterity of invention. The moral gravity and the cen&s;orial declamation of Juvenal, he frequently enlivens with a train of more refined reflection, or adorns with a novelty and variety of images.</P>
<P>In the opening of his general PROLOGUE, he expre&s;&s;es a decent con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the difficulty and danger of his new undertaking. The laurel which he &s;ought had been unworn, and it was not to be won without hazard.</P>

<P>His fir&s;t book, containing nine &s;atires, is aimed at the nu|merous impotent yet fa&s;hionable &s;cribblers with which his age was infe&s;ted. It mu&s;t be e&s;teemed a curious and valuable pic|ture, drawn from real life, of the abu&s;es of poetical compo&s;i|tion which then prevailed; and which our author has at once expo&s;ed with the wit of a &s;pirited &s;atiri&s;t, and the good ta&s;te of a judicious critic. Of Spen&s;er, who could not have been his cotemporary at Cambridge, as &s;ome have thought, but perhaps was his friend, he con&s;tantly &s;peaks with re&s;pect and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>I avail my&s;elf of a more minute analy&s;is of this Book, not only as di&s;playing the critical talents of our &s;atiri&s;t, but as hi&s;|torical of the poetry of the pre&s;ent period, and illu&s;trative of my general &s;ubject. And if in general, I &s;hould be thought too copious and prolix in my examination of the&s;e &s;atires, my apology mu&s;t be, my wi&s;h to revive a neglected writer of real genius, and my opinion, that the fir&s;t legitimate author in our language of a &s;pecies of poetry of the mo&s;t important and
<PB N="7" REF="7">
popular utility, which our countrymen have &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated, and from which Pope derives his chief celebrity, de&s;erved to be di&s;tingui&s;hed with a particular degree of attention.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t &s;atire, which I &s;hall exhibit at length, we learn what kinds of pieces were then mo&s;t in fa&s;hion, and in what manner they were written. They &s;eem to have been, tales of love and chivalry, amatorial &s;onnets, tragedies, come|dies, and pa&s;torals.</P>

<P>The compliment in the clo&s;e to Spen&s;er, is introduced and turned with &s;ingular addre&s;s and elegance. The allu&s;ion is to Spen&s;er's beautiful epi&s;ode of the marriage of Thames and Medway, recently publi&s;hed, in 1595, in the fourth book of the &s;econd part of the FAIRY QUEEN <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">B. iv.

<P>I ob&s;erve here in general, that Thomas Hud&s;on and Henry Lock, were the Bavius and Mevius of this age. In the RE|TURN FROM PARNASSUS, 1606, they are thus con&s;igned to oblivion by Judicio. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Locke and Hud&s;on, &s;leep you quiet

Lock applied the Sonnet to a &s;piritual purpo&s;e, and &s;ub&s;tituting chri&s;tian love in the place of amorous pa&s;&s;ion, made it the vehicle of humiliation, holy comfort, and thank&s;giving.

<P>In the Prologue to this book, our author &s;trives to obviate the objections of certain critics who fal&s;ely and fooli&s;hly thought his &s;atires too per&s;picuous. Nothing could be more ab&s;urd, than the notion, that becau&s;e Per&s;ius is ob&s;cure, therefore ob&s;curity mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily one of the qualities of &s;atire. If Per&s;ius, under the &s;everities of a pro&s;criptive and &s;anguinary government, was often obliged to conceal his meaning, this was not the ca&s;e of Hall. But the darkne&s;s and difficulties of Per&s;ius ari&s;e in great mea&s;ure from his own affectation and fal&s;e ta&s;te. He would have been enigmatical under the milde&s;t government. To be unintelligible can never naturally or properly belong to any &s;pecies of writing. Hall of him&s;elf is certainly ob&s;cure: yet he owes &s;ome of his ob&s;curity to an imitation of this ideal excellence of the Roman &s;atiri&s;ts.</P>
<P>The fourth Book breathes a &s;tronger &s;pirit of indignation,
<PB N="31" REF="31">
and abounds with applications of Juvenal to modern manners, yet with the appearance of original and unborrowed &s;atire.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is mi&s;cellaneous and excur&s;ive, but the &s;ubjects often lead to an unbecoming licentiou&s;ne&s;s of language and images. In the following nervous lines, he has caught and finely heightened the force and manner of his ma&s;ter.</P>

<L>And now the bribed midwife &s;weares apace,</L>
<L>The ba&s;tard babe doth beare his father's face.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>He thus enhances the value of certain novelties, by declaring them to be,
<Q><L>Worth little le&s;s than landing of a whale,</L>
<L>Or Gades &s;poils <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Cadiz was newly taken.</NOTE>, or a churl's funerale.</L></Q></P>

<Q><L>Gird but the cynicke's helmet on his head,</L>
<L>Cares he for Talus, or his flayle of leade?</L></Q></P>
<P>He adds, that the guilty per&s;on, when marked, de&s;troys all di&s;tinction, like the cuttle-fi&s;h concealed in his own blackne&s;s.</P>

<P>There is a carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and laxity in Mar&s;ton's ver&s;ification, but there is a freedom and facility, which Hall has too fre|quently mi&s;&s;ed, by labouring to confine the &s;en&s;e to the couplet. Hall's mea&s;ures are more mu&s;ical, not becau&s;e the mu&s;ic of ver&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in uniformity of pau&s;e, and regularity of cadence. Hall had a correcter ear; and his lines have a tuneful &s;trength, in proportion as his language is more poli&s;hed, his phra&s;eology more &s;elect, and his &s;tructure more &s;tudied. Hall's meaning, among other rea&s;ons, is not always &s;o &s;oon apprehended, on account of his compre&s;&s;ion both in &s;entiment and diction. Mar&s;ton is more per&s;picuous, as he thinks le&s;s and writes ha&s;tily. Hall is &s;uperiour in penetration, accurate conception of character, acutene&s;s of reflection, and the ac|cumulation of thoughts and images. Hall has more humour, Mar&s;ton more acrimony. Hall often draws his materials from books and the diligent peru&s;al of other &s;atiri&s;ts, Mar&s;ton from real life. Yet Hall has a larger variety of characters. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the talent of borrowing with addre&s;s, and of giving originality to his copies. On the whole, Hall is more elegant, exact, and elaborate.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="68">
It is Mar&s;ton's misfortune, that he can never keep clear of the impurities of the brothel. His &s;tream of poetry, if &s;ome|times bright and unpolluted, almo&s;t always betrays a muddy bottom. The &s;atiri&s;t who too freely indulges him&s;elf in the di&s;play of that licentiou&s;ne&s;s which he means to pro&s;cribe, ab|&s;olutely defeats his own de&s;ign. He inflames tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which he profe&s;&s;es to &s;uppre&s;s, gratifies the depravations of a prurient curio&s;ity, and &s;educes innocent minds to an acquaint|ance with ideas which they might never have known.</P>
<P>The &s;atires of Hall and Mar&s;ton were condemned to the &s;ame flame and by the &s;ame authority. But Hall certainly de&s;erved a milder &s;entence. Hall expo&s;es vice, not in the wantonne&s;s of de&s;cription, but with the re&s;erve of a cautious yet lively morali&s;t. Perhaps every cen&s;urer of ob&s;cenity does &s;ome harm, by turning the attention to an immode&s;t object. But this effect is to be counteracted by the force and propriety of his reproof, by &s;hewing the pernicious con&s;equences of volup|tuous exce&s;&s;es, by &s;ugge&s;ting motives to an oppo&s;ite conduct, and by making the picture di&s;gu&s;tful by da&s;hes of deformity. When Vice is led forth to be &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of virtue, the victim &s;hould not be too richly dre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>THE popularity of Hall's and Mar&s;ton's Satires, notwith&s;tanding their pro&s;cription or rather extermi|nation by &s;piritual authority, produced an innumerable crop of SATIRISTS, and of a &s;et of writers, differing but little more than in name, and now properly belonging to the &s;ame &s;pecies, EPIGRAMMATISTS.</P>
