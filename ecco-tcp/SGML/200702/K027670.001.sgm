<HEAD>DEDICATION. To DAVID GARRICK, E&s;q.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I was a&s;k'd to whom I &s;hould dedicate the&s;e volumes, I carele&s;sly an&s;wered to no one&mdash;Why not? (replied the per&s;on who put the que&s;tion to me.) Becau&s;e mo&s;t dedications
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
look like begging a protection to the book. Perhaps a wor&s;e interpretation may be given to it. No, no! already &s;o much obliged, I cannot, will not, put another tax upon the genero&s;ity of any friend of Mr. Sterne's, or mine. I went home to my lodgings, and gratitude warmed my heart to &s;uch a pitch, that I vow'd they &s;hould be dedicated to the man my father &s;o much ad|mired&mdash;who, with an unpre|judiced eye, read, and approved
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
his works, and moreover loved the man&mdash;'Tis to Mr. Garrick then, that I dedicate the&s;e Ge|nuine Letters.</P>
<P>Can I forget the &s;weet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Page 11.</NOTE> Epi|taph which proved Mr. Garrick's friend&s;hip, and opinion of him? 'Twas a tribute to friend&s;hip&mdash;and as a tribute of my gra|titude I dedicate the&s;e volumes to a man of under&s;tanding and
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
feelings&mdash;Receive this, as it is meant&mdash;May you, dear Sir, approve of the&s;e letters, as much as Mr. Sterne admired you&mdash;but Mr. Garrick, with all his ur|banity, can never carry the point half &s;o far, for Mr. Sterne was an enthu&s;ia&s;t, if it is po&s;&s;ible to be one, in favour of Mr. Garrick.</P>
<P>This may appear a very &s;im|ple dedication, but Mr. Garrick will judge by his own &s;en&s;i|bility,
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
that I can feel more than I can expre&s;s, and I believe he will give me credit for all my grateful acknowledgements.</P>
<P>I am, with every &s;entiment of gratitude, and e&s;teem,</P>

<P>IN publi&s;hing the&s;e Letters the Editor does but comply with her mother's reque&s;t, which was, that if any letters were publi&s;h'd under Mr. Sterne's name, that tho&s;e &s;he had in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, (as well as tho&s;e that her father's friends would be kind enough to &s;end to her) &s;hould be likewi&s;e publi&s;h'd&mdash;She depends much

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE AND FAMILY OF THE LATE Rev. Mr. LAURENCE STERNE.</HEAD>
<P>ROGER STERNE, (grand|&s;on to Archbi&s;hop Sterne) Lieutenant in Hand a&s;ide's regi|ment, was married to Agnes He|bert, widow of a captain of a good family: her family name was
<PB N="2" REF="20">
(I believe) Nuttle&mdash;though, upon recollection, that was the name of her father-in-law, who was a noted &s;utler in Flanders, in Queen Ann's wars, where my father married his wife's daugh|ter (N. B. he was in debt to him) which was in September 25, 1711, Old Stile.&mdash;This Nuttle had a &s;on by my grand|mother&mdash;a fine per&s;on of a man but a gracele&s;s whelp&mdash;what be|came of him I know not.&mdash;The family (if any left), live now at Clomwel in the &s;outh of Ire|land,
<PB N="3" REF="21">
at which town I was born November 24th, 1713, a few days after my mother arrived from Dunkirk.&mdash;My birth-day was ominous to my poor father, who was, the day after our ar|rival, with many other brave officers broke, and &s;ent adrift into the wide world with a wife and two children&mdash;the elder of which was Mary; &s;he was born in Li&s;le in French Flanders, July the tenth, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twelve, New Stile.&mdash;This child was mo&s;t un|fortunate&mdash;&s;he
<PB N="4" REF="22">
married one Wee|mans in Dublin&mdash;who u&s;ed her mo&s;t unmercifully&mdash;&s;pent his &s;ub&s;tance, became a bankrupt, and left my poor &s;i&s;ter to &s;hift for her&s;elf,&mdash;which &s;he was able to do but for a few months, for &s;he went to a friend's hou&s;e in the country, and died of a broken heart. She was a mo&s;t beautiful woman&mdash;of a fine figure, and de&s;erved a better fate.&mdash;The regiment, in which my father &s;erved, being broke, he left Ireland as &s;oon as I was able to
<PB N="5" REF="23">
be carried, with the re&s;t of his family, and came to the family &s;eat at Elvington, near York, where his mother lived. She was daughter to Sir Roger Jaques, and an heire&s;s. There we &s;o|journed for about ten months, when the regiment was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and our hou&s;hold de|camped with bag and baggage for Dublin&mdash;within a month of our arrival, my father left us, being ordered to Exeter, where, in a &s;ad winter, my mother and her two children followed him, travelling from
<PB N="6" REF="24">
Liverpool by land to Plymouth. (Melancholy de&s;cription of this journey not nece&s;&s;ary to be tran&s;|mitted here). In twelve months we were all &s;ent back to Dublin.&mdash;My mother, with three of us, (for &s;he laid in at Plymouth of a boy, Joram), took &s;hip at Bri&s;tol, for Ireland, and had a narrow e&s;cape from being ca&s;t away by a leak &s;pringing up in the ve&s;&s;el.&mdash;At length, after many perils, and &s;truggles, we got to Dublin.&mdash;There my father took a large hou&s;e, furni&s;hed it, and in a
<PB N="7" REF="25">
year and a half's time &s;pent a great deal of money.&mdash;In the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and nineteen, all unhing'd again; the regiment was ordered, with many others, to the I&s;le of Wight, in order to embark for Spain in the Vigo expedition. We accompanied the regiment, and was driven into Milford Haven, but landed at Bri&s;tol, from thence by land to Ply|mouth again, and to the I&s;le of Wight&mdash;where I remember we &s;tayed encamped &s;ome time be|fore
<PB N="8" REF="26">
the embarkation of the troops&mdash;(in this expedition from Bri&s;tol to Hamp&s;hire we lo&s;t poor Joram&mdash;a pretty boy, four years old, of the &s;mall-pox), my mother, &s;i&s;ter, and my&s;elf, re|mained at the I&s;le of Wight dur|ing the Vigo Expedition, and until the regiment had got back to Wicklow in Ireland, from whence my father &s;ent for us.&mdash;We had poor Joram's lo&s;s &s;up|plied during our &s;tay in the I&s;le of Wight, by the birth of a girl, Anne, born September the
<PB N="9" REF="27">
twenty-third, one thou&s;and &s;e|ven hundred and nineteen.&mdash;This pretty blo&s;&s;om fell at the age of three years, in the Bar|racks of Dublin&mdash;&s;he was, as I well remember, of a fine deli|cate frame, not made to la&s;t long, as were mo&s;t of my father's babes.&mdash;We embarked for Dub|lin, and had all been ca&s;t away by a mo&s;t violent &s;torm; but through the interce&s;&s;ions of my mother, the captain was prevailed upon to turn back into Wales, where we &s;tayed a month, and at length
<PB N="10" REF="28">
got into Dublin, and travelled by land to Wicklow, where my father had for &s;ome Weeks given us over for lo&s;t.&mdash;We lived in the barracks at Wicklow, one year, (one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and twenty) when Devije|her (&s;o called after Colonel De|vijeher,) was born; from thence we decamped to &s;tay half a year with Mr. Fether&s;ton, a clergy|man, about &s;even miles from Wicklow, who being a relation of my mother's, invited us to his par&s;onage at Animo.&mdash;It was
<PB N="11" REF="29">
in this pari&s;h, during our &s;tay, that I had that wonderful e&s;cape in falling through a mill-race whil&s;t the mill was going, and of being taken up unhurt&mdash;the &s;tory is incredible, but known for truth in all that part of Ire|land&mdash;where hundreds of the common people flocked to &s;ee me.&mdash;From hence we followed the regiment to Dublin, where we lay in the barracks a year.&mdash;In this year, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty-one, I learned to write, &amp;c.&mdash;The regiment,
<PB N="12" REF="30">
ordered in twenty-two, to Car|rickfergus in the north of Ire|land; we all decamped, but got no further than Drogheda, thence ordered to Mullengar, forty miles we&s;t, where by Providence we &s;tumbled upon a kind rela|tion, a collateral de&s;cendant from Archbi&s;hop Sterne, who took us all to his ca&s;tle and kindly en|treated us for a year&mdash;and &s;ent us to the regiment at Car|rickfergus, loaded with kind|ne&s;&s;es, &amp;c.&mdash;a mo&s;t rueful and tedious journey had we all, in
<PB N="13" REF="31">
March, to Carrickfergus, where we arrived in &s;ix or &s;even days&mdash;little Devijeher here died, he was three years old&mdash;He had been left behind at nur&s;e at a farm|hou&s;e near Wicklow, but was fetch'd to us by my father the &s;ummer after&mdash;another child &s;ent to fill his place, Su&s;an; this babe too left us behind in this weary journey&mdash;The autumn of that year, or the &s;pring afterwards, (I forget which) my father got leave of his colonel to fix me at &s;chool&mdash;which he did near Hali|fax,
<PB N="14" REF="32">
with an able ma&s;ter; with whom I &s;taid &s;ome time, 'till by God's care of me my cou&s;in Sterne, of Elvington, became a father to me, and &s;ent me to the univer&s;ity, &amp;c. &amp;c. To pur&s;ue the thread of our &s;tory, my fa|ther's regiment was the year after ordered to Londonderry, where another &s;i&s;ter was brought forth, Catherine, &s;till living, but mo&s;t un|happily e&s;tranged from me by my uncle's wickedne&s;s, and her own folly&mdash;from this &s;tation the regi|ment was &s;ent to defend Gibraltar,
<PB N="15" REF="33">
at the &s;eige, where my father was run through the body by Captain Phillips, in a duel, (the quarrel begun about a goo&s;e) with much difficulty he &s;urvived&mdash;tho' with an impaired con&s;titution, which was not able to with&s;tand the hard&s;hips it was put to&mdash;for he was &s;ent to Jamaica, where he &s;oon fell by the country fever, which took away his &s;en&s;es fir&s;t, and made a child of him, and then, in a month or two, walking about continually without complaining, till the
<PB N="16" REF="34">
moment he &s;at down in an arm chair, and breathed his la&s;t&mdash;which was at Port Antonio, on the north of the i&s;land.&mdash;My father was a little &s;mart man&mdash;active to the la&s;t degree, in all exerci&s;es&mdash;mo&s;t patient of fatigue and di&s;appointments, of which it plea&s;ed God to give him full mea&s;ure&mdash;he was in his temper &s;omewhat rapid, and ha&s;ty&mdash;but of a kindly, &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, void of all de&s;ign; and &s;o inno|cent in his own intentions, that he &s;u&s;pected no one; &s;o that
<PB N="17" REF="35">
you might have cheated him ten times in a day, if nine had not been &s;ufficient for your purpo&s;e&mdash;my poor father died in March 1731&mdash;I remained at Halifax 'till about the latter end of that year, and cannot omit mention|ing this anecdote of my&s;elf, and &s;chool-ma&s;ter&mdash;He had had the cieling of the &s;chool-room new white-wa&s;hed&mdash;the ladder re|mained there&mdash;I one unlucky day mounted it, and wrote with a bru&s;h in large capital letters, LAU. STERNE, for which the
<PB N="18" REF="36">
u&s;her &s;everely whipped me. My ma&s;ter was very much hurt at this, and &s;aid, before me, that never &s;hould that name be ef|faced, for I was a boy of genius, and he was &s;ure I &s;hould come to preferment&mdash;this expre&s;&s;ion made me forget the &s;tripes I had received&mdash;In the year thirty-two my cou&s;in &s;ent me to the univer|&s;ity, where I &s;taid &s;ome time. 'Twas there that I commenced a friend&s;hip with Mr. H... which has been mo&s;t la&s;ting on both &s;ides&mdash;I then came to York,
<PB N="19" REF="37">
and my uncle got me the living of Sutton&mdash;and at York I be|come acquainted with your mo|ther, and courted her for two years&mdash;&s;he owned &s;he liked me, but thought her&s;elf not rich enough, or me too poor, to be joined together&mdash;&s;he went to her &s;i&s;ter's in S&mdash;, and I wrote to her often&mdash;I believe then &s;he was partly determined to have me, but would not &s;ay &s;o&mdash;at her return &s;he fell into a con|&s;umption&mdash;and one evening that I was &s;itting by her with an al|mo&s;t

My uncle and my&s;elf were then upon very good terms, for he &s;oon got me the Prebendary of York&mdash;but he quarrelled with me afterwards, becau&s;e I would
<PB N="21" REF="39">
not write paragraphs in the news|papers&mdash;though he was a party|man, I was not, and dete&s;ted &s;uch dirty work: thinking it beneath me&mdash;from that period, he be|came my bittere&s;t enemy.&mdash;By my wife's means I got the living of Stillington&mdash;a friend of her's in the &s;outh had promi&s;ed her, that if &s;he married a clergyman in York&s;hire, when the living became vacant, he would make her a compliment of it.
