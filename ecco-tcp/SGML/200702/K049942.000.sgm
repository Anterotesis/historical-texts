<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM, LORD MARQUISS Of HARTINGTON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>EVery Body is now &s;o full of Bu&s;ine&s;s, that things of this kind, which are generally taken for the Entertainment of lei&s;ure Hours only, look like Impertinence and Interruption. I am &s;ure it is a Rea&s;on why I ought to beg your Lord&s;hip's Pardon, for troubling you with this Tragedy; Not but that Poetry has always been, and will &s;till be the En|tertainment of all wi&s;e Men, that have any Delicacy in their Knowledge; Yet at &s;o Critical a Juncture as this is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I think your Lord&s;hip ought to give intirely into tho&s;e Publick Affairs, which at this time &s;eem to Demand you. It is that happy Turn which your Lord&s;hip has to Bu&s;ine&s;s, that right Under&s;tand|ing of your Country's Intere&s;t, and that con&s;tant Zeal to pur&s;ue it, that ju&s;t Thinking, that &s;trong and per
<PB REF="4">
&s;ua&s;ive Elocution, that firm and generous Re&s;olution, which upon all Occa&s;ions you have &s;hewn in Parlia|ments; and to add, that which is the crowning good Quality, your Lord&s;hip's continual Adherence and Un|&s;haken Loyalty to His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, which make you at this time &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the Publick. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, (tho' there is no part in your Lord&s;hip's Cha|racter, but what the World &s;hould be fond of) I can|not help Di&s;tingui&s;hing the la&s;t In&s;tance very particular|ly: It is doing (methinks) &s;uch a Ju&s;tice to Goodne&s;s, to Greatne&s;s, and to Right Rea&s;on, that Po&s;terity will believe there could be no Man of good Sen&s;e, but what mu&s;t have agreed with your Lord&s;hip in it. When the next Age &s;hall Read the Hi&s;tory of this, What Ex|cu&s;e can they make for tho&s;e who did not Admire a Prince who&s;e Life has been a Series of good Offices done to Mankind? When they &s;hall reckon up his La|bours from the Battle of <HI>Seneff,</HI> to &s;ome Glorious Acti|on, which &s;hall be his La&s;t, (and which I therefore hope is very far remov'd from the Pre&s;ent Time?) Will they ever believe that he could have been too well lov'd, or too faithfully &s;erv'd and defended? The Great Things which he did before we had that immediate Intere&s;t in him, which we now happily have, is a noble and ju&s;t Subject for Panegyrick; but as Benefits done to Others, can never touch us &s;o &s;en&s;ibly as tho&s;e we receive our &s;elves, tho' the Actions may be equally great; &s;o, methinks, I can hardly have patience to run back to his having &s;av'd his own Country, when I con&s;ider he has &s;ince done the &s;ame for Us; Let that be &s;ufficient to Us, for all we can &s;ay of him or do for him. What Dangers and
<PB REF="5">
Difficulties has he not &s;truggled through, for the Ho|nour and Safety of the&s;e Kingdoms? 'Tis a common Prai&s;e, and what every one &s;peaks, to &s;ay, He has con|tinually expos'd his Life for his People; But there are &s;ome things more particular in his Character, &s;ome things rarely found among&s;t the Policies of Princes; a Zeal for Religion, moderated by Rea&s;on, without the Rage and Fire of Per&s;ecution; a charitable Compa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e who cannot be convinc'd, and an unalterable Per|&s;everance in tho&s;e Principles of who&s;e Truth he is &s;atis|fy'd; a de&s;ire of War for the &s;ake of Peace; and of Peace for the Good and Honour of his Subjects equal|ly with his own; a pious Care for compo&s;ing Factions, tho' to foment them might make him Arbitrary; and a generous Ambition that only aims at Pow'r, to en|able him to do good to all the re&s;t of the World. I might add here, that Inviolable and Religious Ob&s;ervance of his Royal Word, which the be&s;t part of the Pow'rs of <HI>Europe,</HI> have &s;o frequently and &s;o happily, for them|&s;elves, depended upon in the greate&s;t Emergencies. But as this Virtue is generally reckon'd as no more than that common Hone&s;ty, which the meane&s;t Man would blu&s;h to be without, &s;o it can hardly claim a Place among&s;t the more particular Excellencies of a Great Prince. It were to be wi&s;h'd, indeed, that the World were hone&s;t to &s;uch a degree, and that there were not that &s;candalous defect of common Morality. Certainly nothing can be more &s;hocking to Humanity, to the Peace and Order of the World; nothing can approach nearer to that Savage &s;tate of Nature, in which every Man is to eat
<PB REF="6">
his fellow if he can ma&s;ter him, than an avow'd Liber|ty of breaking thro' all the mo&s;t &s;olemn Engagements of publick Faith. 'Tis &s;omething that brands a Man with an Infamy, which nothing can extenuate or wipe out; he may prote&s;t and pretend to explain his mean|ing, but the World has generally too much indignati|on for the Affront, to bear it at that ea&s;ie rate. Mini|&s;ters and Secretaries of State, may di&s;play their own Parts in Memorials, with as much Pomp and Flouri&s;h as they plea&s;e: I fancy the common an&s;wer upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions will always be, You have deceiv'd us gro&s;ly, and we neither can nor will tru&s;t you any more. When this Vice comes among&s;t Men of the fir&s;t Rank, it is the more &s;hocking, and I could wi&s;h there were none &s;uch, to who&s;e charge it might be laid.</P>
<P>Some People (who do me a very great Honour in it) have fancy'd, that in the Per&s;on of <HI>Tamerlane</HI> I have alluded to the greate&s;t Character of the pre&s;ent Age, I don't know, whether I ought not to apprehend a great deal of Danger from avowing a De&s;ign like that. It may be a Task indeed worthy the greate&s;t Genius, which this, or any other Time has produc'd: But therefore I ought not to &s;tand the &s;hock of a Parallel, lea&s;t it &s;hould be &s;een, to my Di&s;advantage, how far the <HI>Hero</HI> has <HI>tran&s;cended the Poet's Thought.</HI> There are many Features, 'tis true, in that Great Man's Life, not unlike His Ma|je&s;ty: His Courage, his Piety, his Moderation, his Ju&s;tice, and his Fatherly Love of his People, but above all, his Hate of Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion, and his zea lous Care for the Common Good of Mankind, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">

large Re&s;emblance of Him: Several Incidents are alike in their Stories; and there wants nothing to his Maje&s;ty but &s;uch a deciding Victory, as that by which <HI>Tamerlane</HI> gave Peace to the World. That is yet to come: But I hope we may rea&s;onably expect it from the unanimi|ty of the pre&s;ent Parliament, and &s;o formidable a Force as that Unanimity will give Life and Vigour to.</P>
<P>If your Lord&s;hip can find any thing in this Poem like a Prince, who is &s;o ju&s;tly the Object of your Lord&s;hip's, and indeed of the World's Veneration, I per&s;uade my &s;elf it will prevail with you to forgive every thing el&s;e that you find ami&s;s. You will excu&s;e the Faults in Writing, for the goodne&s;s of the Intention. I hope too, your Lord&s;hip will not be di&s;pleas'd, that I take this opportunity of renewing the Honour which I formerly had, to be known to your Lord&s;hip, and which gives me at once the Plea&s;ure of expre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Ju&s;t and Dutiful Sentiments I have for his Maje&s;ty, and that &s;trong Inclination which I have always had to be thought,</P>
