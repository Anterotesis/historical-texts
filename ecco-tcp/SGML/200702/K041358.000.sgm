<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE author hopes it will not be thought impertinent to &s;ay &s;omething of the motives which in|duced him to enter into the following enquiry. The matters which make the &s;ubject of it had formerly engaged a great deal of his attention. But he often found him&s;elf greatly at a lo&s;s; he found that he was far from hav|ing any thing like an exact theory of our pa&s;&s;ions, or a knowledge of their genuine &s;ources; he found that he could not reduce his notions to any
<PB N="vi" REF="3">
fixed or con&s;i&s;tent principles; and he had remarked, that others lay under the &s;ame difficulties.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved that the ideas of the &s;ublime and beautiful were frequently confounded; and that both were in|di&s;criminately applied to things greatly differing, and &s;ometimes of natures directly oppo&s;ite. Even Longinus, in his incomparable di&s;cour&s;e upon a part of this &s;ubject, has comprehended things extremely repugnant to each other, un|der one common name of the <HI>Sublime.</HI> The abu&s;e of the word <HI>Beauty,</HI> has been &s;till more general, and attended with &s;till wor&s;e con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Such a confu&s;ion of ideas mu&s;t cer|tainly render all our rea&s;onings upon &s;ubjects of this kind extremely inaccu|rate and inconclu&s;ive. Could this ad|mit
<PB N="vii" REF="4">
of any remedy, I imagined it could only be from a diligent exami|nation of our pa&s;&s;ions in our own brea&s;ts; from a careful &s;urvey of the properties of things which we find by experience to influence tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions; and from a &s;ober and attentive inve&s;ti|gation of the laws of nature, by which tho&s;e properties are capable of affecting the body, and thus of exciting our pa&s;|&s;ions. If this could be done, it was imagined that the rules deducible from &s;uch an enquiry might be applied to the imitative arts, and to whatever el&s;e they concerned, without much dif|ficulty.</P>
<P>It is four years now &s;ince this en|quiry was fini&s;hed; during which time the author found no cau&s;e to make any material alteration in his theory.
<PB N="viii" REF="5">
He has &s;hewn it to &s;ome of his friends, men of learning and candour, who do not think it wholly unrea&s;onable; and he now ventures to lay it before the public, propo&s;ing his notions as probable conjectures, not as things certain and indi&s;putable; and if he has any where expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf more po&s;itively, it was owing to inatten|tion.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I. NOVELTY.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t and the &s;imple&s;t emotion which we di&s;cover in the human mind, is Curio&s;ity. By curio&s;ity, I mean whatever de&s;ire we have for, or what|ever plea&s;ure we take in novelty. We &s;ee children perpetually running from place to place to hunt out &s;omething new; they catch with great eagerne&s;s, and with very little choice, at whatever comes before them; their attention is engaged by every thing, becau&s;e every thing has, in that &s;tage of life, the charm of novelty to recommend it. But as tho&s;e things which engage us merely by their novelty, cannot attach us for any length of
<PB N="2" REF="15">
time, curio&s;ity is the mo&s;t &s;uperficial of all the affections; it changes it's object perpetually; it has an appetite which is very &s;harp, but very ea&s;ily &s;atisfied; and it has always an ap|pearance of giddine&s;s, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and anxiety. Curio&s;ity from it's nature is a very active prin|ciple; it quickly runs over the greate&s;t part of it's objects, and &s;oon exhau&s;ts the variety which is commonly to be met with in nature; the &s;ame things make frequent returns, and they return with le&s;s and le&s;s of any agreeable effect. In &s;hort, the occurrences of life, by the time we come to know it a little, would be incapable of affecting the mind with any other &s;en&s;ations than tho&s;e of loathing and wearine&s;s, if many things were not adapted to affect the mind by means of other powers be&s;ides novelty in them, and of other pa&s;&s;ions be&s;ides curio&s;ity in our&s;elves. These powers and pa&s;&s;ions &s;hall be con&s;idered in their place. But whatever the&s;e powers are, or upon what principle &s;oever they affect the mind, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould not be exerted in tho&s;e things which a daily and vulgar u&s;e have brought into a &s;tale unaffecting familiarity. Some de|gree of novelty mu&s;t be one of the materials in every in&s;trument which works upon the mind; and curio&s;ity blends it&s;elf more or le&s;s with all our pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="3" REF="16">
<HEAD>SECT. II. PAIN and PLEASURE.</HEAD>
<P>IT &s;eems then nece&s;&s;ary towards moving the pa&s;&s;ions of people advanced in life to any con&s;iderable degree, that the objects de&s;igned for that purpo&s;e, be&s;ides their being in &s;ome mea&s;ure new, &s;hould be capable of exciting pain or plea&s;ure from other cau&s;es. Pain and plea&s;ure are &s;imple ideas, incapable of defi|nition. People are not liable to be mi&s;taken in their feelings, but they are very frequently wrong in the names they give them, and in their rea&s;on|ings about them. Many people are of opinion, that pain ari&s;es nece&s;&s;arily from the removal of &s;ome plea&s;ure; as they think plea&s;ure does from the cea&s;ing or diminution of &s;ome pain. For my part I am rather inclined to imagine, that pain and plea&s;ure in their mo&s;t &s;imple and natural manner of affecting, are each of a po&s;itive nature, and by no means nece&s;&s;arily dependent upon each other for their exi&s;tence. The human mind is often, and I think it is for the mo&s;t part, in a &s;tate neither of pain nor plea&s;ure, which I call a &s;tate of indif|ference. When I am carried from this &s;tate into a &s;tate of actual plea&s;ure, it does not ap|pear
<PB N="4" REF="17">
nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould pa&s;s through the medium of any &s;ort of pain. If in &s;uch a &s;tate of indifference, or ea&s;e, or tranquility, or call it what you plea&s;e, you were to be &s;uddenly entertained with a concert of mu&s;ic; or &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome object of a fine &s;hape, and bright and lively colours to be pre&s;ented before you; or imagine your &s;mell is gratified with the fragrance of a ro&s;e; or if without any previous thir&s;t you were to drink of &s;ome plea&s;ant kind of wine; or to ta&s;te of &s;ome &s;weetmeat without being hungry; in all the &s;everal &s;en&s;es, of hearing, &s;melling, and ta&s;te|ing, you undoubtedly find a plea&s;ure: yet if I enquire into the &s;tate of your mind pre|vious to the&s;e gratifications, you will hardly tell me that they found you in any kind of pain; or having &s;atisfied the&s;e &s;everal &s;en&s;es with their &s;everal plea&s;ures, will you &s;ay that any pain has &s;ucceeded, though the plea&s;ure is ab&s;olutely over? Suppo&s;e on the other hand, a man in the &s;ame &s;tate of in|difference, to receive a violent blow, or to drink of &s;ome bitter potion, or to have his ears wounded with &s;ome har&s;h and grating &s;ound; here is no removal of plea&s;ure; and yet here is felt, in every &s;en&s;e which is affect|ed, a pain very di&s;tingui&s;hable. It may be &s;aid perhaps, that the pain in the&s;e ca&s;es had
<PB N="5" REF="18">
it's ri&s;e from the removal of that plea&s;ure which he enjoyed before, though that plea&s;ure was of &s;o low a degree as to be perceived only by the removal; but this &s;eems to me to be a &s;ubtilty, that is not di&s;coverable in nature. For if, previous to the pain, I do not feel any actual plea&s;ure, I have no rea&s;on to judge that any &s;uch thing exi&s;ts; &s;ince plea&s;ure is only plea&s;ure as it is felt. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of pain, and with equal rea&s;on. I can never per&s;uade my&s;elf that plea&s;ure and pain are mere relations, which can only exi&s;t as they are contra&s;ted: but I think I can di&s;cern clearly that there are po&s;itive pains and plea|&s;ures, which do not at all depend upon each other. Nothing is more certain to my own feelings than this. There is nothing which I can di&s;tingui&s;h in my mind with more clear|ne&s;s than the three &s;tates, of indifference, of plea&s;ure, and of pain. Every one of the&s;e I can perceive without any &s;ort of idea of it's relation to any thing el&s;e. Caius is af|flicted with a fit of the cholic; this man is actually in pain; &s;tretch Caius upon the rack, he will feel a much greater pain; but does this pain of the rack ari&s;e from the removal of any plea&s;ure? or is the fit of the cholic a plea&s;ure or a pain ju&s;t as we are plea&s;ed to con&s;ider it?</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. The difference between the removal of PAIN and po&s;itive PLEASURE.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall carry this propo&s;ition yet a &s;tep further. We &s;hall venture to propo&s;e, that pain and plea&s;ure are not only, not ne|ce&s;&s;arily dependent for their exi&s;tence on their mutual diminution or removal, but that, in reality, the diminution or cea&s;ing of plea&s;ure does not operate like po&s;itive pain; and that the removal or diminution of pain, in it's effect has very little re&s;emblance to po&s;itive plea&s;ure.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr Locke (e&s;&s;ay on human under&s;tanding, l. 2. c. 20. &s;ect. 16.) thinks that the removal or le&s;&s;ening of a pain is con&s;idered and operates as a plea&s;ure, and the lo&s;s or dimini&s;hing of plea&s;ure as a pain. It is this opinion which we con&s;ider here.</NOTE> The former of the&s;e propo&s;itions will, I believe, be much more readily allowed than the latter; becau&s;e it is very evident that plea&s;ure, when it has run it's career, &s;ets us down very nearly where it found us. Plea&s;ure of every kind quickly &s;atisfies; and when it is over, we relap&s;e into indifference, or rather we fall into a &s;oft tranquility, which is tinged with the agreeable colour of the
<PB N="7" REF="20">
former &s;en&s;ation. I own, it is not at fir&s;t view &s;o apparent, that the removal of a great pain does not re&s;emble po&s;itive plea&s;ure: but let us recollect in what &s;tate we have found our minds upon e&s;caping &s;ome imminent dan|ger, or on being relea&s;ed from the &s;everity of &s;ome cruel pain. We have on &s;uch occa&s;ions found, if I am not much mi&s;taken, the temper of our minds in a tenor very remote from that which attends the pre&s;ence of po&s;itive plea|&s;ure; we have found them in a &s;tate of much &s;obriety, impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of awe, in a &s;ort of tranquility &s;hadowed with horror. The fa&s;hion of the countenance and the ge&s;ture of the body on &s;uch occa&s;ions is &s;o corre&s;pondent to this &s;tate of mind, that any per&s;on, a &s;tranger to the cau&s;e of the appearance, would rather judge us under &s;ome con&s;ternation, than in the enjoyment of any thing like po&s;itive plea&s;ure.

This &s;triking appearance of the man whom Homer &s;uppo&s;es to have ju&s;t e&s;caped an im|minent danger, the &s;ort of mixt pa&s;&s;ion of terror and &s;urprize, with which he affects the &s;pectators, paints very &s;trongly the manner in which we find our&s;elves affected upon occa|&s;ions any way &s;imilar. For when we have &s;uf|fered from any violent emotion, the mind na|turally continues in &s;omething like the &s;ame condition, after the cau&s;e which fir&s;t produced it has cea&s;ed to operate; the to&s;&s;ing of the &s;ea remains after the &s;torm; and when this remain of horror has entirely &s;ub&s;ided, all the pa&s;&s;ion, which the accident rai&s;ed, &s;ub&s;ides along with it; and the mind returns to it's u&s;ual &s;tate of indifference. In &s;hort, plea&s;ure, (I mean any thing either in the inward &s;en&s;a|tion, or in the outward appearance like plea|&s;ure from a po&s;itive cau&s;e,) has never, I ima|gine, it's origin from the removal of pain or danger.</P>

That grief &s;hould be willingly endured, though far from a &s;imply plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation, is not &s;o difficult to be un|der&s;tood.

at particular times, I do not think it affects at all.

<P>THE final cau&s;e of the difference in character between the pa&s;&s;ions which regard &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and tho&s;e which are directed to the multiplication of the &s;pecies, will illu&s;trate the foregoing remarks yet fur|ther; and it is, I imagine, worthy of ob&s;er|vation even upon it's own account.

It is true, that they &s;tick &s;everally to their own &s;pecies in preference to all others; but this preference, I imagine, does not ari&s;e from any &s;en&s;e of beauty which they find in their &s;pecies, as Mr. Addi&s;on &s;uppo&s;es, but from a law of &s;ome other kind to which they are &s;ubject; and this we may fairly conclude, from their apparent want of choice among&s;t tho&s;e objects to which the barriers of their &s;pecies have confined them. But man, who is a creature adapted to a greater variety and intricacy of relation, connects with the gene|ral pa&s;&s;ion, the idea of &s;ome <HI>&s;ocial</HI> qualities, which direct and heighten the appetite which he has in common with all other ani|mals; and as he is not de&s;igned like them to live at large, it is fit that he &s;hould have &s;ome|thing to create a preference, and fix his choice; and this in general &s;hould be &s;ome &s;en&s;ible quality; as no other can &s;o quickly, &s;o pow|erfully; or &s;o &s;urely produce it's effect. The object therefore of this mixed pa&s;&s;ion which we call love, is the <HI>beauty</HI> of the <HI>&s;ex.</HI> Men are carried to the &s;ex in general, as it is the &s;ex, and by the common law of nature; but they are attached to particulars by per&s;onal <HI>beauty.</HI> I call beauty a &s;ocial quality; for where women and men, and not only they,

or it may turn upon ideas of plea&s;ure, and then, whatever has been &s;aid of the &s;ocial af|fections, whether they regard &s;ociety in gene|ral, or only &s;ome particular modes of it, may be applicable here. It is by this principle chiefly that poetry, painting, and other affecting arts, transfu&s;e their pa&s;&s;ions from one brea&s;t to ano|ther, and are often capable of grafting a de|light on wretchedne&s;s, mi&s;ery, and death it|&s;elf.

<P>TO examine this point concerning the ef|fect of tragedy in a proper manner, we mu&s;t previou&s;ly con&s;ider, how we are affected by the feelings of our fellow creatures in cir|cum&s;tances of real di&s;tre&s;s. I am convinced we have a degree of delight, and that no &s;mall one, in the real misfortunes and pains of others; for let the affection be what it will in appearance, if it does not make us &s;hun &s;uch objects, if on the contrary it induces us to approach them, if it makes us dwell upon them, in this ca&s;e I conceive we mu&s;t have a delight or plea&s;ure of &s;ome &s;pecies or other in contemplating objects of this kind. Do we not read the authentic hi&s;tories of &s;cenes of this nature with as much plea&s;ure as romances or poems, where the incidents are fictitious? The pro&s;perity of no empire, nor the gran|deur of no king, can &s;o agreeably affect in the reading, as the ruin of the &s;tate of Ma|cedon, and the di&s;tre&s;s of it's unhappy prince.
<PB N="24" REF="37">
Such a cata&s;trophe touches us in hi&s;tory as much as the de&s;truction of Troy does in fable, Our delight in ca&s;es of this kind, is very greatly heightened, if the &s;ufferer be &s;ome ex|cellent per&s;on who &s;inks under an unworthy fortune. Scipio and Cato are both virtuous characters; but we are more deeply affected by the violent death of the one, and the ruin of the great cau&s;e he adhered to, than with the de&s;erved triumphs and uninterrupted pro&s;perity of the other; for terror is a pa&s;&s;ion which always produces delight when it does not pre&s;s too clo&s;e, and pity is a pa&s;&s;ion accompanied with plea&s;ure, becau&s;e it ari&s;es from love and &s;ocial affection. Whenever we are formed by nature to any active purpo&s;e, the pa&s;&s;ion which animates us to it, is attended with de|light, or a plea&s;ure of &s;ome kind, let the &s;ub|ject matter be what it will; and as our Cre|ator has de&s;igned we &s;hould be united toge|ther by &s;o &s;trong a bond as that of &s;ympathy, he has therefore twi&s;ted along with it a pro|portionable quantity of this ingredient; and always in the greate&s;t proportion where our &s;ympathy is mo&s;t wanted, in the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others.

The delight we have in &s;uch things, hinders us from &s;hunning &s;cenes of mi&s;ery; and the pain we feel, prompts us to relieve our&s;elves in relieving tho&s;e who &s;uf|fer; and all this antecedent to any rea&s;oning, by an in&s;tinct that works us to its own pur|po&s;es, without our concurrence.</P>

And indeed in &s;ome ca&s;es we derive as much or more plea&s;ure from that &s;ource than from the thing it&s;elf. But then
<PB N="26" REF="39">
I imagine we &s;hall be much mi&s;taken if we attri|bute any con&s;iderable part of our &s;atisfaction in tragedy to a con&s;ideration that tragedy is a de|ceit, and its repre&s;entations no realities. The nearer it approaches the reality, and the further it removes us from all idea of fiction, the more perfect is its power. But be its power of what kind it will, it never approaches to what it repre&s;ents. Chu&s;e a day on which to repre&s;ent the mo&s;t &s;ublime and affecting tragedy which we have; appoint the mo&s;t favourite actors; &s;pare no co&s;t upon the &s;cenes and decorations; unite the greate&s;t efforts of poetry, painting and mu|&s;ic; and when you have collected your audi|ence, ju&s;t at the moment when their minds are erect with expectation, let it be reported that a &s;tate criminal of high rank is on the point of being executed in the adjoining &s;quare; in a moment the emptine&s;s of the theatre would demon&s;trate the comparative weakne&s;s of the imitative arts, and proclaim the triumph of the real &s;ympathy. I believe that this notion of our having a &s;imple pain in the reality, yet a delight in the repre&s;entation ari&s;es from hence, that we do not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h what we would by no means chu&s;e to do, from what we &s;hould be eager enough to &s;ee if it was once done.

But &s;up|po&s;e &s;uch a fatal accident to have happened, what numbers from all parts would croud to behold the ruins, and among&s;t them many who would have been content never to have &s;een London in it's glory? Nor is it either in real or fictitious di&s;tre&s;&s;es, our immunity from them which produces our delight; in my own mind I can di&s;cover nothing like it. I ap|prehend that this mi&s;take is owing to a &s;ort of &s;ophi&s;m, by which we are frequently im|po&s;ed upon; it ari&s;es from our not di&s;tingui&s;h|ing between what is indeed a nece&s;&s;ary con|dition to our doing or &s;uffering any thing, and what is the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of &s;ome particular act. If a man kills me with a &s;word; it is a nece&s;&s;ary condition to this that we &s;hould have been both of us alive before the fact; and yet it would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that our being both living creatures was the cau&s;e of his crime and of my death. So it is certain, that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary my li&s;e &s;hould be out of any im|minent hazard before I can take a delight in the &s;ufferings of others, real or imaginary,
<PB N="28" REF="41">
or indeed in any thing el&s;e from any cau&s;e what&s;oever. But then it is a &s;ophi&s;m to ar|gue from thence, that this immunity is the cau&s;e of my delight either on the&s;e or on any occa&s;ions. No one can di&s;tingui&s;h &s;uch a cau&s;e of &s;atisfaction in his own mind I believe; nay when we do not &s;uffer any very acute pain, nor are expo&s;ed to any imminent danger of of our lives, we can feel for others, whil&s;t we &s;uffer our&s;elves; and often then mo&s;t when we are &s;oftened by affliction; we &s;ee with pity even di&s;tre&s;&s;es which we would accept in the place of our own.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVI. IMITATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;econd pa&s;&s;ion belonging to &s;ociety is imitation, or, if you will, a de&s;ire of imi|tating, and con&s;equently a plea&s;ure in it. This pa&s;&s;ion ari&s;es from much the &s;ame cau&s;e with &s;ympathy. For as &s;ympathy makes us take a concern in whatever men feel, &s;o this affecti|on prompts us to copy whatever they do; and con&s;equently we have a plea&s;ure in imitating, and in whatever belongs to imitation merely as it is &s;uch, without any intervention of the rea&s;oning faculty, but &s;olely from our natural
<PB N="29" REF="42">
con&s;titution, which providence has framed in &s;uch a manner as to find either plea&s;ure or de|light according to the nature of the object, in whatever regards the purpo&s;es of our being. It is by imitation far more than by precept that we learn every thing; and what we learn thus we acquire not only more effectually, but more plea&s;antly. This forms our manners, our opinions, our lives. It is one of the &s;tronge&s;t links of &s;ociety; it is a &s;pecies of mutual com|pliance which all men yield to each other, without con&s;traint to them&s;elves, and which is extremely flattering to all. Herein it is that painting and many other agreeable arts have laid one of the principal foundations of their power. I &s;hall here venture to lay down a rule, which may inform us with a good degree of certainty when we are to attribute the power of the arts, to imitation, or to our plea&s;ure of the &s;kill of the imitator merely, and when to &s;ympathy, or &s;ome other cau&s;e in conjunction with it. When the object repre&s;ented in poe|try or painting is &s;uch, as we could have no de&s;ire of &s;eeing in reality; then I may be &s;ure that it's power in poetry or painting is owing to the power of imitation, and to no cau&s;e operating in the thing it&s;elf. So it is with mo&s;t of the pieces which the painters call Still life. In the&s;e a cottage, a dunghill, the meane&s;t and mo&s;t
<PB N="30" REF="43">
ordinary uten&s;ils of the kitchen, are capable of giving us plea&s;ure. But when the object of the painting or poem is &s;uch as we &s;hould run to &s;ee if real, let it affect us with what odd &s;ort of &s;en&s;e it will, we may rely upon it, that the power of the poem or picture is more owing to the nature of the thing it&s;elf than to the mere effect of imitation, or to a con&s;ideration of the &s;kill of the imitator however excellent. Ari&s;totle has &s;poken &s;o much and &s;o &s;olidly upon the force of imitation in his poetics, that it makes any further di&s;cour&s;e upon this &s;ubject the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVII. AMBITION.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHO' imitation is one of the great in&s;truments u&s;ed by providence in bring|ing our nature towards it's perfection, yet if men gave them&s;elves up to imitation entirely, and each followed the other, and &s;o on in an eternal circle, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that there never could be any improvement among&s;t them. Men mu&s;t remain as brutes do, the &s;ame at the end that they are at this day, and that they were in the beginning of the world. To prevent this, God has planted in man a
<PB N="31" REF="44">
&s;en&s;e of ambition, and a &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing from the contemplation of his excelling his fellows in &s;omething deemed valuable among&s;t them. It is this pa&s;&s;ion that drives men to all the ways we &s;ee in u&s;e of &s;ignalizing them&s;elves, and that tends to make whatever excites in a man the idea of this di&s;tinction &s;o very plea|&s;ant. It has been &s;o &s;trong as to make very mi&s;erable men take comfort that they were &s;upreme in mi&s;ery; and certain it is, that where we cannot di&s;tingui&s;h our&s;elves by &s;ome|thing excellent, we begin to take a compla|cency in &s;ome &s;ingular infirmities, follies, or defects of one kind or other. It is on this principle that flattery is &s;o prevalent; for flat|tery is no more than what rai&s;es in a man's mind an idea of a preference which he has not. Now whatever either on good or upon bad grounds tends to rai&s;e a man in his own opinion, produces a &s;ort of &s;welling and tri|umph that is extremely grateful to the human mind; and this &s;welling is never more per|ceived, nor operates with more force, than when without danger we are conver&s;ant with terrible objects, the mind always claim|ing to it&s;elf &s;ome part of the dignity and im|portance of the objects with which it is con|ver&s;ant; hence proceeds what Longinus has ob&s;erved of that glorying and &s;en&s;e of inward

<P>THE &s;econd head to which the pa&s;&s;ions are referred in relation to their final cau&s;e, is &s;ociety. There are two &s;orts of &s;ocieties. The fir&s;t is, the &s;ociety of &s;ex. The pa&s;&s;ion belonging to this is called love, and it contains a mixture of lu&s;t; its object is the beauty of women. The other is the great &s;ociety with man and all other animals. The pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub|&s;ervient to this is called likewi&s;e love, but it has no mixture of lu&s;t, and its object is beauty; which is a name I &s;hall apply to all &s;uch qua|lities in things as induce in us a &s;en&s;e of affecti|on and tenderne&s;s, or &s;ome other pa&s;&s;ion the mo&s;t nearly re&s;embling the&s;e. The pa&s;&s;ion of love has its ri&s;e in po&s;itive plea&s;ure; it is, like all things which grow out of plea&s;ure, capable of being mixed with a mode of un|ea&s;ine&s;s, that is, when an idea of its object is excited in the mind with an idea at the &s;ame time of having irretrievably lo&s;t it.

<HEAD>SECT. XXI. The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>I Believed that an attempt to range and me|thodize &s;ome of our mo&s;t leading pa&s;&s;ions would be a good preparative to an enquiry of the nature of that which is to be attempted in the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e. The pa&s;&s;ions I have
<PB N="35" REF="48">
mentioned are almo&s;t the only ones which it can be nece&s;&s;ary to our pre&s;ent de&s;ign to con|&s;ider; though the variety of the pa&s;&s;ions is great, and worthy in every branch of that va|riety of an attentive inve&s;tigation. The more accurately we &s;earch into the human mind, the &s;tronger traces we every where find of his wi&s;dom who made it. If a di&s;cour&s;e on the u&s;e of the parts of the body may be con&s;idered as an hymn to the Creator; the u&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ions, which are the organs of the mind, cannot be barren of prai&s;e to him, nor unpro|ductive to our&s;elves of that noble and uncommon union of &s;cience, and admiration, which a contemplation of the works of infinite wi&s;dom alone can afford to a rational mind; whil&s;t re|ferring to him whatever we find of right, or good, or fair in our&s;elves, di&s;covering his &s;trength and wi&s;dom even in our own weak|ne&s;s and imperfection, honouring them where we di&s;cover them clearly, and adoring their profundity where we are lo&s;t in our &s;earch, we may be inqui&s;itive without impertinence, and elevated without pride; we may be admit|ted, if I may dare to &s;ay &s;o, into the coun&s;els of the Almighty by a con&s;ideration of his works. This elevation of the mind ought to be the principal end of all our &s;tudies, which
<PB N="36" REF="49">
if they do not in &s;ome mea&s;ure effect, they are of very little &s;ervice to us. But be&s;ides this great purpo&s;e, a con&s;ideration of the rationale of our pa&s;&s;ions &s;eems to me very nece&s;&s;ary for all who would affect them upon &s;olid and &s;ure princi|ples. It is not enough to know them in ge|neral; to affect them after a delicate manner, or to judge properly of any work de&s;igned to affect them, we &s;hould know the exact boun|daries of their &s;everal juri&s;dictions; we &s;hould pur&s;ue them through all their variety of opera|tions, and pierce into the inmo&s;t, and what might appear inacce&s;&s;ible parts of our nature,
<Q>Quod latet arcan&acirc; non enarrabile fibr&acirc;.</Q>
Without all this it is po&s;&s;ible for a man after a confu&s;ed manner, &s;ometimes to &s;atisfy his own mind of the truth of his work; but he never can have a certain determinate rule to go by, nor can he ever make his propo&s;itions &s;ufficient|ly clear to others. Poets, and orators, and painters, and tho&s;e who cultivate other branches of the liberal arts, have without this critical knowledge &s;ucceeded well in their &s;e|veral provinces, and will &s;ucceed; as among artificers there are many machines made and even invented without any exact knowledge of
<PB N="37" REF="50">
the principles they are governed by. It is, I own, not uncommon to be wrong in theory and right in practice; and we are happy that it is &s;o. Men often act right from their feelings, who afterwards rea&s;on but ill on them from princi|ple; but as it is impo&s;&s;ible to avoid an attempt at &s;uch rea&s;oning, and equally impo&s;&s;ible to pre|vent its having &s;ome influence on our practice, &s;urely it is worth taking &s;ome pains to have it ju&s;t, and founded on the ba&s;is of &s;ure experi|ence. The arti&s;ts them&s;elves, who might be mo&s;t relied on here, have been too much oc|cupied in the practice; the philo&s;ophers have done little, and what they have done, was mo&s;tly with a view to their own &s;chemes and &s;y&s;tems; and as for tho&s;e called critics, they have generally &s;ought the rule of the arts in the wrong place; they &s;ought it among poems, pictures, engravings, &s;tatues and buildings. But art can never give the rules that make an art. This is, I believe, the rea&s;on why arti&s;ts in general, and poets principally, have been confined in &s;o narrow a circle; they have been rather imitators of one another than of nature; and this with &s;o faithful an unifor|mity, and to &s;o remote an antiquity, that it is hard to &s;ay who gave the fir&s;t model. Critics follow them, and therefore can do little as
<PB N="38" REF="51">
guides. I can judge but poorly of any thing whil&s;t I mea&s;ure it by no other &s;tandard than it&s;elf. The true &s;tandard of the arts is in every man's power; and an ea&s;y ob&s;ervation of the commone&s;t, &s;ometimes of the meane&s;t things in nature, will give the true&s;t lights, where the greate&s;t &s;agacity and indu&s;try that &s;lights &s;uch ob&s;ervation, mu&s;t leave us in the dark, or what is wor&s;e, amu&s;e and mi&s;lead us by fal&s;e lights. In an enquiry, it is almo&s;t every thing to be once in a right road. I am &s;atisfied I have done but little by the&s;e ob&s;ervations con&s;idered in them&s;elves, and I never &s;hould have taken the pains to dige&s;t them, much le&s;s &s;hould I have ever ventured to publi&s;h them, if I was not convinced that nothing tends more to the corruption of &s;cience than to &s;uffer it to &s;tagnate. The&s;e waters mu&s;t be troubled be|fore they can exert their virtues. A man who works beyond the &s;urface of things, though he may be wrong him&s;elf, yet clears the way for others, and may chance to make even his errors &s;ub&s;ervient to the cau&s;e of truth. In the following parts, I &s;hall enquire what things they are that cau&s;e in us the affections of the &s;ublime and beautiful, as in this I have con|&s;idered the affections them&s;elves. I only de|&s;ire one favour; that no part of this di&s;cour&s;e
<PB N="39" REF="52">
may be judged of by it&s;elf, and independently of the re&s;t; for I am &s;en&s;ible I have not di&s;|po&s;ed my materials to abide the te&s;t of a cap|tious controver&s;y, but of a &s;ober and even for|giving examination; that they are not armed at all points for battle; but dre&s;&s;ed to vi&s;it tho&s;e who are willing to give a peaceful en|trance to truth.</P>

<Q><L>Segnius irritant animos demi&s;&s;a per aures</L>
<L>Quam quae &s;unt oculis &s;ubjecta fidelibus.</L></Q>
On this the abbe du Bos founds a critici&s;m, wherein he gives painting the preference to poetry in the article of moving the pa&s;&s;ions;
<PB N="47" REF="59">
and that on account principally of the greater <HI>clearne&s;s</HI> of the ideas it repre&s;ents. I believe this excellent judge was led into this mi&s;take, (if it be a mi&s;take) by his &s;y&s;tem, to which he found it more conformable than I imagine it will be found to experience. I know &s;everal who admire and love painting, and yet who regard the objects of their admiration in that art, with coolne&s;s enough, in compari&s;on of that warmth with which they are animated by affecting pieces of poetry or rhethoric. Among the com|mon &s;ort of people, I never could perceive that painting had much influence on their pa&s;&s;ions. It is true that the be&s;t &s;orts of painting, as well as the be&s;t &s;orts of poetry, are not much under|&s;tood in that &s;phere. But it is mo&s;t certain, that their pa&s;&s;ions are very &s;trongly rou&s;ed by a fanatic preacher, or by the ballads of Chevy-cha&s;e, or the children in the wood, and by other little popular poems and tales that are current in that rank of life. I do not know of any paintings, bad or good, that produce the &s;ame effect. So that poetry with all its ob&s;cu|rity, has a more general as well as a more powerful dominion over the pa&s;&s;ions than the other art.

For, &s;uppo&s;ing the arms of the cro&s;s every way equal, if you &s;tand in a direction parallel to any of the &s;ide walls, or colonnades, in&s;tead of a deception that makes the building more extended than it is, you are cut off from a con&s;iderable part (two thirds) of its <HI>actual</HI> length; and to prevent all po&s;&s;ibility of progre&s;&s;ion, the arm of the cro&s;s taking a new direction, makes a right angle with the beam, and thereby wholly turns the imagination from the repetition of the former idea.

Some or all of the&s;e objections, will lie again&s;t every figure of a cro&s;s, in whatever view you take it.

The &s;ame may be &s;aid of a &s;ingle &s;troke on a drum, repeated with pau&s;es; and of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive firing of cannon at a di&s;tance; all the effects mentioned in this &s;ection have cau&s;es very nearly alike.</P>

<P>A LOW, tremulous, intermitting &s;ound, though it &s;eems in &s;ome re&s;pects oppo&s;ite to that ju&s;t mentioned, is productive of the &s;ub|lime. It is worth while to examine this a little.

Now &s;ome low, confu&s;ed, uncertain &s;ounds, leave us in the &s;ame fearful anxiety concerning their cau|&s;es, that no light, or an uncertain light does concerning the objects that &s;urround us.

<HEAD>SECT. II. Proportion not the cau&s;e of BEAUTY in VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<P>BEAUTY is u&s;ually &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in cer|tain proportions of parts; on con&s;ider|ing the matter, I have great rea&s;on to doubt, whether beauty be at all an idea belonging to proportion. Proportion relates almo&s;t wholly to convenience, as every idea of order &s;eems to do; and it mu&s;t therefore be con&s;idered as a creature of the under&s;tanding, rather than a primary cau&s;e acting on the &s;en&s;es and imagination. It is not by the force of long at|tention and enquiry that we find any object to be beautiful; beauty demands no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from our rea&s;oning; even the will is uncon|cerned: the appearance of beauty as effectu|ally cau&s;es &s;ome degree of love in us, as the application of ice or fire produces the ideas of heat or cold. To gain &s;omething like a &s;a|tisfactory conclu&s;ion in this point; it were well to examine, fir&s;t, in what things we find this quality of beauty; next, to &s;ee whether
<PB N="75" REF="87">
in the&s;e, we can find any a&s;&s;ignable propor|tions, in &s;uch a manner as ought to convince us, that our idea of beauty re&s;ults from them. We &s;hall con&s;ider this plea&s;ing power, as it appears in vegetables, in the inferior animals, and in man. Turning our eyes to the vege|table creation, we find nothing there &s;o beau|tiful as flowers; but flowers are of almo&s;t every &s;ort of &s;hape, and of every &s;ort of di&s;po&s;ition; they are turned and fa&s;hioned into an infinite variety of forms; and from the&s;e forms, bota|ni&s;ts have given them their names, which are almo&s;t as various. What proportion do we di&s;cover between the &s;talks and the leaves of flowers, or between the leaves and the pi&s;tils? How does the &s;lender &s;talk of the ro&s;e agree with the bulky head under which it bends? but the ro&s;e is a beautiful flower; and can we undertake to &s;ay that it does not owe a great deal of its beauty even to that di&s;propor|tion? the ro&s;e is a large flower, yet it grows upon a &s;mall &s;hrub; the flower of the apple is very &s;mall, and it grows upon a large tree; yet the ro&s;e and the apple blo&s;&s;om are both beautiful, and the plants that bear them are mo&s;t engagingly attired notwith&s;tanding this di&s;proportion. What by general con&s;ent is allowed to be a more beautiful object than an orange tree, flouri&s;hing at once with its leaves,
<PB N="76" REF="88">
its blo&s;&s;oms, and its fruit? but it is in vain that we &s;earch here for any proportion between the height, the breadth, or any thing el&s;e con|cerning the dimen&s;ions of the whole, or con|cerning the relation of the particular parts to each other. I grant that we may ob&s;erve in many flowers, &s;omething of a regular figure, and of a methodical di&s;po&s;ition of the leaves. The ro&s;e has &s;uch a figure and &s;uch a dipo&s;i|tion of its petals; but in an oblique view, when this figure is in a good mea&s;ure lo&s;t, and the order of the leaves confounded, it yet re|tains its beauty; the ro&s;e is even more beau|tiful before it is full blown; in the bud; before this exact figure is formed; and this is not the only in&s;tance wherein method and exact|ne&s;s, the &s;oul of proportion, are found rather prejudicial than &s;erviceable to the cau&s;e of beauty.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. Proportion not the cau&s;e of BEAUTY in ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>THAT proportion has but a &s;mall &s;hare in the formation of beauty, is full as evident among animals. Here the greate&s;t variety of &s;hapes, and di&s;po&s;itions of parts are well fitted,
<PB N="77" REF="89">
to excite this idea. The &s;wan, confe&s;&s;edly a beautiful bird, has a neck longer than the re&s;t of his body, and but a very &s;hort tail; is this a beautiful proportion? we mu&s;t allow that it is. But then what &s;hall we &s;ay to the pea|cock, who has comparatively but a &s;hort neck, with a tail longer than the neck and the re&s;t of the body taken together? How many birds are there that vary infinitely from each of the&s;e &s;tandards, and from every other which you can fix, with proportions different, and often directly oppo&s;ite to each other! and yet many of the&s;e birds are extremely beautiful; when upon con&s;idering them we find nothing in any one part that might determine us, <HI>a priori,</HI> to &s;ay what the others ought to be, nor indeed to gue&s;s any thing about them, but what expe|rience might &s;hew to be full of di&s;appointment and mi&s;take. And with regard to the colours either of birds or flowers, for there is &s;ome|thing &s;imilar in the colouring of both, whe|ther they are con&s;idered in their exten&s;ion or gradation, there is nothing of proportion to be ob&s;erved. Some are of but one &s;ingle colour; others have all the colours of the rainbow; &s;ome are of the primary colours, others are of the mixt; in &s;hort, an attentive ob&s;erver may &s;oon conclude, that there is as little of proportion in the colouring as in the
<PB N="78" REF="90">
&s;hapes of the&s;e objects. Turn next to bea&s;ts; examine the head of a beautiful hor&s;e; find what proportion that bears to his body, and to his limbs, and what relation the&s;e have to each other; and when you have &s;ettled the&s;e proportions as a &s;tandard of beauty, then take a dog or cat, or any other animal, and ex|amine how far the &s;ame proportions between their heads and their necks, between tho&s;e and the body, and &s;o on, are found to hold; I think we may &s;afely &s;ay, that they differ in every &s;pecies, yet that there are individuals found in a great many &s;pecies &s;o differing, that have a very &s;triking beauty.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV. Proportion not the cau&s;e of BEAUTY in the human &s;pecies.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are &s;ome parts of the hu|man body, that are ob&s;erved to hold certain proportions to each other; but before it can be proved, that the efficient cau&s;e of beauty lies in the&s;e, it mu&s;t be &s;hewn, that wherever the&s;e are found exact, the per&s;on to whom they belong is beautiful. I mean in the effect produced on the view, either of any member di&s;tinctly con&s;idered, or
<PB N="79" REF="91">
of the whole body together. It mu&s;t be like|wi&s;e &s;hewn, that the&s;e parts &s;tand in &s;uch a relation to each other, that the compari&s;on between them may be ea&s;ily made, and that the affection of the mind may naturally re&s;ult from it. For my part, I have at &s;everal times very carefully examined many of tho&s;e pro|portions, and found them hold very nearly, or altogether alike in many &s;ubjects, which were not only very different from one another, but where one has been very beautiful, and the other very remote from beauty. With re|gard to the parts which are found &s;o propor|tioned, they are often &s;o remote from each other, in &s;ituation, nature, and office, that I cannot &s;ee how they admit of any compari&s;on, nor con&s;equently how any effect owing to pro|portion can re&s;ult from them. The neck, &s;ay they, in beautiful bodies &s;hould mea&s;ure with the calf of the leg; it &s;hould likewi&s;e be twice the circumference of the wri&s;t. And an infi|nity of ob&s;ervations of this kind to be found in the writings, and conver&s;ations of many. The&s;e proportions are certainly to be found in hand&s;ome bodies. They are as certainly in ugly ones, as any who will take the pains to try, may find. Nay, I do not know but they may be lea&s;t perfect in &s;ome of the mo&s;t beau|tiful. How are the partizans of proportional
<PB N="80" REF="92">
beauty agreed about the proportions of the human body? &s;ome hold it to be &s;even heads; others make it eight; a va&s;t difference in &s;uch a &s;mall number of divi&s;ions! others take other methods of e&s;timating the proportions, and all with equal &s;ucce&s;s. But are the&s;e pro|portions exactly the &s;ame in all hand&s;ome men? or are they at all the proportions found in beautiful women? nobody will &s;ay that they are; yet both &s;exes are capable of beauty, but the female of the greate&s;t, which I believe will hardly be attributed to the &s;uperior exact|ne&s;s of proportion in the fair &s;ex. In fine, take the head as the mea&s;ure of proportion in any &s;pecies of animals, as in men; and having found what relation that bears to the other parts, examine the beautiful animals of the winged and four-footed kinds by this rule; and it will &s;hew evidently what a fallacious &s;tandard we have cho&s;en; the &s;ame will hap|pen if you take any other part of any other animal what&s;oever, as your rule to mea&s;ure by. The proportions of animals are relative to the <HI>u&s;ual form</HI> in which we &s;ee them; if this is changed, we are &s;hocked in the &s;ame manner that we are when any thing happens contrary to expectation. It mu&s;t not be denied, that if the parts of any animal are &s;o formed that they do not well &s;upport
<PB N="81" REF="93">
each other, the effect is di&s;agreeable; but to have them &s;imply otherwi&s;e, that is, not bur|then&s;ome to one another, does not by any means produce beauty.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. Proportion further con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>NOW if it be allowed, that almo&s;t every &s;ort of form, and every manner of ar|rangement is con&s;i&s;tent with beauty, I ima|gine it amounts to a conce&s;&s;ion that no par|ticular proportions are nece&s;&s;ary to it. But if I am not mi&s;taken, a great deal of the opi|nions concerning proportion have ari&s;en from this; that <HI>deformity</HI> has been con&s;idered as the oppo&s;ite to <HI>beauty</HI>; and that the removal of the former of the&s;e qualities gave birth to the latter. This I believe is a mi&s;take. For <HI>de|formity</HI> is oppo&s;ed, not to beauty, but to the <HI>compleat, common form.</HI> If one of the legs of a man be found &s;horter than the other, the man is deformed; becau&s;e there is &s;omething wanting to compleat the whole idea we form of a man; and this has the &s;ame effect in natural faults, as maiming and mutilation pro|duce from accidents. So if the back be humped, the man is deformed; becau&s;e his
<PB N="82" REF="94">
back has an unu&s;ual figure, and what carries with it the idea of &s;ome di&s;ea&s;e or misfortune; &s;o if a man's neck be con&s;iderably longer or &s;horter than u&s;ual, we &s;ay he is deformed in that part, becau&s;e men are not commonly made in that manner. But &s;urely every hour's expe|rience may convince us, that a man may have his legs of an equal length, and re&s;embling each other in all re&s;pects, and his neck of a ju&s;t &s;ize, and his back quite &s;trait, without hav|ing at the &s;ame time the lea&s;t perceivable beauty. Deformity ari&s;es from the want of the common proportions; but the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of their exi&s;tence in any object is not beauty. I &s;ay the common proportions in each &s;pecies of animals, becau&s;e the&s;e pro|portions vary in all of them; there can be no ab&s;olute proportion a&s;&s;igned which con|&s;titutes an univer&s;al beauty; and a proportion which cannot be a&s;&s;igned, is, in other words, no proportion at all. But if proportion in na|tural things be relative to cu&s;tom and u&s;e, the nature of u&s;e and cu&s;tom will &s;hew, that beauty, which is a po&s;itive and powerful quality, can|not re&s;ult from it. We are &s;o wonderfully formed, that at the &s;ame time that we are creatures vehemently de&s;irous of novelty, we are as &s;trongly attached to habit and cu&s;tom. But it is the nature of things which hold us
<PB N="83" REF="95">
by cu&s;tom to affect us very little whil&s;t we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, but &s;trongly when they are ab&s;ent. I remember to have frequented a certain place, every day for a long time toge|ther; and I may truly &s;ay, that &s;o far from finding plea&s;ure in it, that I was affected with a fort of wearine&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t; I came, I went, I returned without plea&s;ure; yet if by any means I pa&s;&s;ed by the u&s;ual time of my going thither, I was remarkably unea&s;y, and was not quiet till I had got into my old track. They who u&s;e &s;nuff take it almo&s;t without being &s;en&s;ible that they take it, and the acute &s;en&s;e of &s;mell is deadened &s;o as to feel hardly any thing from &s;o &s;harp a &s;timulus; yet deprive the &s;nuff-taker of his box, and he is the mo&s;t unea&s;y mortal in the world. So the want of the u&s;ual proportion in men and other animals is &s;ure to di&s;gu&s;t, though their pre&s;ence is by no means any cau&s;e of real plea&s;ure. It is true, that the proportions laid down as cau&s;es of beauty in the human body are frequently found in beautiful ones, becau&s;e they are generally found in all mankind; but if it can be &s;hewn too that they are found without beauty, and that beauty frequently exi&s;ts without them, and that this beauty, where it exi&s;ts, always can be a&s;&s;igned to other le&s;s equivocal cau&s;es, it will naturally lead us to conclude, that pro|portion
<PB N="84" REF="96">
and beauty are not ideas of the &s;ame nature. The true oppo&s;ite to beauty is not di&s;proportion or deformity, but <HI>ugline&s;s</HI>; and as it proceeds from cau&s;es oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of po&s;itive beauty, we cannot con&s;ider it until we come to treat of that. Between beauty and ugline&s;s there is a &s;ort of mediocrity, in which the a&s;&s;igned proportions are mo&s;t com|monly found, but this has no effect upon the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. FITNESS not the cau&s;e of BEAUTY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;aid that the idea of utility, or of a part's being well adapted to an&s;wer its end, is the cau&s;e of beauty, or indeed beauty it&s;elf. This notion is clo&s;ely allied to the former one of proportion, but &s;urely never aro&s;e from experience. For at that rate, the wedge-like &s;nout of a &s;wine, with its tough cartilage at the end, its little &s;unk eyes, and the whole make &s;o well adapted to its offices of digging, and rooting, would be extremely beautiful. The great bag hanging to the bill of a pelican, a thing highly u&s;eful to this animal, would be likewi&s;e as beautiful in our eyes. The hedgehog, &s;o well &s;ecured again&s;t all a&s;&s;aults
<PB N="85" REF="97">
by his prickly hide, or the porcupine with his mi&s;&s;ile quills, would be then con&s;idered as creatures of no &s;mall beauty. There are few animals, who&s;e parts are better contrived than tho&s;e of a monkey, he has the hands of a man, joined to the &s;pringy limbs of a bea&s;t; and is admirably calculated for running, leaping, grappling, and climbing: and yet there are few animals &s;eem to us to have le&s;s beauty. To leave the&s;e foreign examples; if beauty in our own &s;pecies, was annexed to u&s;e, men would be much more lovely than women; and &s;trength and agility would be con&s;idered as the only beauties. But to call &s;trength by the name of beauty, to have but one denomina|tion for the qualities of a Venus and Hercu|les, &s;o totally different in almo&s;t all re&s;pects, is &s;urely a &s;trange confu&s;ion of ideas, or abu&s;e of words. The cau&s;e of this confu&s;ion, I ima|gine, proceeds from our frequently per|ceiving the parts of the human and other animal bodies to be at once very beautiful, and very well adapted to their purpo&s;es; and we are deceived by a &s;ophi&s;m, which makes us take that for a cau&s;e which is only a conco|mitant; this is the &s;ophi&s;m of the fly; who imagined he rai&s;ed a great du&s;t, becau&s;e he &s;tood upon the chariot that really rai&s;ed it. The &s;tomach, the lungs, the liver, as well as
<PB N="86" REF="98">
other parts, are incomparably well adapted to their purpo&s;es; yet they are far from hav|ing any beauty. Again, many things are very beautiful, in which it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;|cern any idea of u&s;e. And I appeal to the fir&s;t and mo&s;t natural feelings of mankind, whether on beholding a beautiful eye, or a well-fa&s;hion|ed mouth, or a well-turned leg, any ideas of their being well fitted for &s;eeing, eating, or running, ever pre&s;ent them&s;elves. What idea of u&s;e is it that flowers excite, the mo&s;t beautiful part of the vegetable world? It is true, that the infinitely wi&s;e and good Creator has, of his bounty, frequently joined beauty to tho&s;e things which he has made u&s;eful to us; but this does not prove that an idea of u&s;e and beauty are the &s;ame thing, or that they are any way dependent on each other.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. The real effects of FITNESS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I excluded proportion and fit|ne&s;s from any &s;hare in beauty, I did not by any means intend to &s;ay that they were of no value, or that they ought to be di&s;|regarded in works of art. Works of art are the proper &s;phere of their power; and here it
<PB N="87" REF="99">
is that they have their full effect. Whenever the wi&s;dom of our Creator intended that we &s;hould be affected with any thing, he did not confide the execution of his de&s;ign to the languid and precarious operation of our rea|&s;on; but he endued it with powers and pro|perties that prevent the under&s;tanding, and even the will, which &s;eizing upon the &s;en&s;es and imagination, captivate the &s;oul before the under&s;tanding is ready either to join with them or to oppo&s;e them. It is by a long deduction and much &s;tudy that we di&s;cover the adorable wi&s;dom of God in his works: when we di&s;|cover it, the effect is very different, not only in the manner of acquiring it, but in its own nature, from that which &s;trikes us without any preparation from the &s;ublime or the beau|tiful. How different is the &s;atisfaction of an anatomi&s;t, who di&s;covers the u&s;e of the mu&s;cles and of the &s;kin, the excellent contrivance of the one for the various movements of the body, and the wonderful texture of the other, at once a general, covering and at once a general outlet, as well as inlet; how dif|ferent is this from the affection which po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es an ordinary man at the &s;ight of a de|licate &s;mooth &s;kin, and all the other parts of beauty which require no inve&s;tigation to be perceived? In the former ca&s;e, whil&s;t we
<PB N="88" REF="100">
look up to the Maker with admiration and prai&s;e, the object which cau&s;es it may be odious and di&s;ta&s;teful; the latter very often &s;o touches us by its power on the ima|gination, that we examine but little into the artifice of its contrivance, and we have need of a &s;trong effort of our rea&s;on to di&s;entangle our minds from the allurements of the object to a con&s;ideration of the wi&s;dom of that hand which invented &s;o powerful a machine. The effect of proportion and fitne&s;s, at lea&s;t &s;o far as they proceed from a mere con&s;ideration of the work it&s;elf, produce approbation, the ac|quie&s;cence of the under&s;tanding, but not love, nor any pa&s;&s;ion of that &s;pecies. When we examine the &s;tructure of a watch, when we come to know thoroughly the u&s;e of every part of it, &s;atisfied as we are with the fitne&s;s of the whole, we are far enough from per|ceiving any thing like beauty in the watch-work it&s;elf; but let us look on the ca&s;e, the labour of &s;ome curious arti&s;t in engraving, with little or no idea of u&s;e, we &s;hall have a much livelier idea of beauty than we ever could have had from the watch it&s;elf, though the ma&s;ter-piece of Graham. In beauty, as I &s;aid, the effect is previous to any know|ledge of the u&s;e; but to judge of proportion, we mu&s;t know the end for which any work is
<PB N="89" REF="101">
de&s;igned. According to the end the propor|tion varies. Thus there is one proportion of a tower, another of an hou&s;e; one proportion of a gallery, another of an hall, another of a chamber. To judge of the proportions of the&s;e, you mu&s;t be fir&s;t acquainted with the purpo&s;es for which they were de&s;igned. Good &s;en&s;e and experience acting together, find out what is fit to be done in every work of art. We are rational creatures, and in all our works we ought to regard their end and pur|po&s;e; the gratification of any pa&s;&s;ion, how innocent &s;oever, ought only to be of &s;econd|ary con&s;ideration. Herein is placed the real power of fitne&s;s and proportion; they ope|rate on the under&s;tanding con&s;idering them, which <HI>approves</HI> the work and acquie&s;ces in it. The pa&s;&s;ions, and the imagination which prin|cipally rai&s;es them, have here very little to do. When a room appears in its original naked|ne&s;s, bare walls and a plain cieling; let its proportion be ever &s;o excellent, it plea&s;es very little; a cold approbation is the utmo&s;t we can reach; a much wor&s;e proportioned room, with elegant mouldings and fine fe&s;toons, gla&s;&s;es, and other merely ornamental furniture, will make the imagination revolt again&s;t the rea&s;on; it will plea&s;e much more than the naked proportion of the fir&s;t room which
<PB N="90" REF="102">
the under&s;tanding has &s;o much approved, as admirably fitted for its purpo&s;es. What I have here &s;aid and before concerning propor|tion, is by no means to per&s;uade people ab|&s;urdly to neglect the idea of u&s;e in the works of art. It is only to &s;hew that the&s;e excellent things, beauty and proportion, are not the &s;ame; not that they &s;hould either of them be di&s;regarded.</P>

<P>THERE is another notion current, pretty clo&s;ely allied to the former; that <HI>Perfection</HI> is the con&s;tituent cau&s;e of beauty. This opinion has been made to extend much further than to &s;en&s;ible objects. But in the&s;e, &s;o far is perfection, con&s;idered as &s;uch, from being the cau&s;e of beauty; that this quality, where it is highe&s;t in the female &s;ex, almo&s;t always carries with it an idea of weakne&s;s and imperfection. Women are very &s;en&s;ible of this; for which rea&s;on, they learn to li&s;p, to tot|ter in their walk, to counterfeit weakne&s;s, and even &s;ickne&s;s. In all this, they are guided by nature. Beauty in di&s;tre&s;s is much the mo&s;t affecting beauty. Blu&s;hing has little le&s;s power; and mode&s;ty in general, which is a tacit allowance of imperfection, is it&s;elf con|&s;idered as an amiable quality, and certainly heightens every other that is &s;o. I know, that it is in every body's mouth, that we ought to love perfection. This is to me a &s;ufficient

<HEAD>SECT. X. How far the idea of BEAUTY may be ap|plied to the qualities of the MIND.</HEAD>
<P>NOR is this remark in general le&s;s appli|cable to the qualities of the mind. Tho&s;e virtues which cau&s;e admiration, and are of the &s;ublimer kind, produce terror rather than love. Such as fortitude, ju&s;tice, wi&s;dom, and the like. Never was any man amiable by force of the&s;e qualities. Tho&s;e which en|gage our hearts, which impre&s;s us with a &s;en&s;e of loveline&s;s, are the &s;ofter virtues; ea&s;ine&s;s of temper, compa&s;&s;ion, kindne&s;s and liberality; though certainly tho&s;e latter are of le&s;s immediate and momentous concern to &s;ociety, and of le&s;s dignity. But it is for that rea&s;on that they are &s;o amiable. The great virtues turn principally on dangers, puni&s;h|ments, and troubles, and are exerci&s;ed rather in preventing the wor&s;t mi&s;chiefs, than in di&s;|pen&s;ing favours; and are therefore not lovely,
<PB N="93" REF="105">
though highly venerable. The &s;ubordinate turn on reliefs, gratifications, and indulgences; and are therefore more lovely, though inferior in dignity. Tho&s;e per&s;ons who creep into the hearts of mo&s;t people, who are cho&s;en as the companions of their &s;ofter hours, and their reliefs from care and anxiety, are never per&s;ons of &s;hining qualities, nor &s;trong vir|tues. It is rather the &s;oft green of the &s;oul on which we re&s;t our eyes, that are fatigued with beholding more glaring objects. It is worth ob&s;erving, how we feel our&s;elves affected with reading the characters of Cae&s;ar, and Cato, as they are &s;o finely drawn and con|tra&s;ted in Salu&s;t. In one, the <HI>igno&s;cendo, largiundo</HI>; in the other, <HI>nil largiundo.</HI> In one, the <HI>mi&s;eris perfugium</HI>; in the other, <HI>malis perniciem.</HI> In the latter we have much to ad|mire, much to reverence, and perhaps &s;ome|thing to fear; we re&s;pect him, but we re|&s;pect him at a di&s;tance. The former makes us familiar with him; we love him, and he leads us whither he plea&s;es. To draw things clo&s;er to our fir&s;t and mo&s;t natural feelings; I will add to this a remark made upon reading this &s;ection by an ingenious friend. The authority of a father, &s;o u&s;eful to our well-being, and &s;o ju&s;tly venerable upon all accounts, hinders us from having that entire love for him that
<PB N="94" REF="106">
we have for our mothers, where the parental authority is almo&s;t melted down into the mo|ther's fondne&s;s and indulgence. But we gene|rally have a great love for our grandfathers, in whom this authority is removed a degree from us, and where the weakne&s;s of age mel|lows it into &s;omething of a feminine par|tiality.</P>

The general application of this metaphorical quality to virtue, has a &s;trong tendency to confound our ideas of things; and it has given ri&s;e to an infinite deal of whim&s;ical theory; as the affixing the name of beauty to proportion, congruity and perfec|tion, as well as to qualities of things yet more remote from our natural ideas of it, and from one another, has tended to confound our ideas of beauty, and left us no &s;tandard or rule to judge by, that was not even more uncertain and fallacious than our own fancies.</P>

And we ought there|fore to con&s;ider in what manner tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible qualities are di&s;po&s;ed, in &s;uch things as by ex|perience we find beautiful, or which excite in us the pa&s;&s;ion of love, or &s;ome corre&s;pond|ent affection.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIII. Beautiful objects &s;mall.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t obvious point that pre&s;ents it&s;elf to us in examining any object, is its extent or quantity. And what degree of extent prevails in bodies, that are held beau|tiful, may be gathered from the u&s;ual manner of expre&s;&s;ion concerning it. I am told that in mo&s;t languages, the objects of love are &s;poken of under diminutive epithets. It is &s;o in all the languages of which I have any knowledge. in Greek the <GAP DESC="foreign">, and other diminutive terms, are almo&s;t always the terms of affection and tenderne&s;s. The&s;e diminutives were com|monly added by the &s;ame people to the names of per&s;ons with whom they conver&s;ed on terms of friend&s;hip and familiarity. Though the Romans were a people of le&s;s quick and de|licate feelings, yet they naturally &s;lid into the le&s;&s;ening termination upon the &s;ame occa&s;ions. Anciently in the Engli&s;h language the di|mini&s;hing <HI>ling</HI> was added to the names of per&s;ons or things that were the objects of love. Some we retain &s;till, as darling, (or little dear) and a few others. But to this day in ordinary conver&s;ation, it is u&s;ual to add the endearing
<PB N="97" REF="109">
name of <HI>little</HI> to every thing we love; the French and Italians make u&s;e of the&s;e affection|ate diminutives even more than we. In the animal creation, out of our own &s;pecies, it is the &s;mall we are inclined to be fond of. Little birds, and &s;ome of the &s;maller kinds of bea&s;ts. A great beautiful thing, is a manner of ex|pre&s;&s;ion &s;carcely ever u&s;ed; but that of a great ugly thing, is very common. There is a wide difference between admiration and love. The &s;ublime, which is the cau&s;e of the former, always dwells on great objects, and terrible; the latter on &s;mall ones, and plea&s;ing; we &s;ubmit to what we admire; but we love what &s;ubmits to us; in one ca&s;e we are forced, in the other we are flattered into compliance. In &s;hort, the ideas of the &s;ublime and the beau|tiful &s;tand on foundations &s;o different, that it is hard, I had almo&s;t &s;aid impo&s;&s;ible, to think of reconciling them in the &s;ame &s;ubject, with|out con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ening the effect of the one or the other upon the pa&s;&s;ions.

<P>THE next property con&s;tantly ob&s;ervable in &s;uch objects is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part. 4 &s;ect. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Smoothne&s;s.</HI> A qua|lity &s;o e&s;&s;ential to beauty, that I do not now recollect any thing beautiful that is not &s;mooth. In trees and flowers, &s;mooth leaves are beau|tiful; &s;mooth &s;lopes of earth in gardens; &s;mooth &s;treams in the land&s;cape; &s;mooth coats of birds and bea&s;ts in animal beauties; in fine women, &s;mooth &s;kins; and in &s;everal &s;orts of ornamental furniture, &s;mooth and poli&s;h|ed &s;urfaces. A very con&s;iderable part of the effect of beauty is owing to this quality; in|deed the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. For take any beautiful object, and give it a broken and rugged &s;urface, and however well form|ed it may be in other re&s;pects, it plea&s;es no longer. Whereas let it want ever &s;o many of the other con&s;tituents, if it wants not this, it becomes more plea&s;ing than al|mo&s;t all the others without it. This &s;eems to me &s;o evident, that I am a good deal &s;ur|pri&s;ed, that none who have handled the &s;ub|ject

<P>AN air of robu&s;tne&s;s and &s;trength is very prejudicial to beauty. An appearance of <HI>delicacy,</HI> and even of fragility, is almo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential to it. Whoever examines the vege|table or animal creation, will find this ob&s;er|vation to be founded in nature. It is not the oak, the a&s;h, or the elm, or any of the robu&s;t trees of the fore&s;t which we con&s;ider as beautiful; they are awful and maje&s;tic; they in&s;pire a &s;ort of reverence. It is the delicate myrtle, it is the orange, it is the almond, it is the je&s;&s;amine, it is the vine, which we look on as vegetable beauties. It is the flowery &s;pecies, &s;o remarkable for its weakne&s;s and momentary duration, that gives us the livelie&s;t idea of beauty, and elegance. Among animals; the greyhound is more beautiful than the ma&s;tiff; and the delicacy of a gennet, a barb, or an Arabian hor&s;e, is much more amiable, than the &s;trength and &s;tability of &s;ome hor&s;es of war or carriage. I need here &s;ay little of the fair &s;ex, where I believe the point will be ea&s;ily allowed me. The beauty of women is con|&s;iderably owing to their weakne&s;s, or delicacy,
<PB N="102" REF="114">
and is even enhanced by their timidity, a quality of mind analogous to it. I would not here be under&s;tood to &s;ay, that weakne&s;s be|traying very bad health has any &s;hare in beau|ty; but the ill effect of this is not becau&s;e it is weakne&s;s, but becau&s;e the ill &s;tate of health which produces &s;uch weakne&s;s alters the other conditions of beauty; the parts in &s;uch a ca&s;e collap&s;e; the bright colour, the <HI>lumen purpu|reum juventae</HI> is gone; and the fine variation is lo&s;t in wrinkles, &s;udden breaks, and right lines.</P>

Thirdly, if the colours be &s;trong and vivid, they are always diver&s;ified, and the object is never of one &s;trong colour; there are almo&s;t always &s;uch a number of them (as in variegated flowers) that the &s;trength and glare of each is con&s;iderably abated.

I think then, that the beauty of the eye con&s;i&s;ts, fir&s;t, in its <HI>clearne&s;s</HI>; what <HI>coloured</HI> eye &s;hall plea&s;e mo&s;t, depends a good deal on particular fancies; but none are plea&s;ed with an eye, who&s;e water (to u&s;e that term) is dull and muddy. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 4. &s;ect. 25.</NOTE> We are plea&s;ed with the eye in this view, on the principle upon which we like diamonds, clear water, gla&s;s, and &s;uch like tran&s;parent &s;ub&s;tances. Secondly, the motion of the eye contributes to its beauty, by continually &s;hifting its direction; but a &s;low and languid motion is more beautiful than a bri&s;k one; the latter is enlivening; the former lovely. Thirdly, with regard to its union with the neighbouring parts, it is to hold the &s;ame rule that is given of other beautiful ones; it is not to make a &s;trong deviation from the
<PB N="106" REF="118">
line of the neighbouring parts; nor to verge into any exact geometrical figure. Be&s;ides all this, the eye affects, as it is expre&s;&s;ive of &s;ome qualities of the mind, and its principal power generally ari&s;es from this; &s;o that what we have ju&s;t &s;aid of the phy&s;iognomy is applicable here.</P>

<P>IT may perhaps appear like a &s;ort of repe|tition of what we have before &s;aid, to in&s;i&s;t here upon the nature of <HI>Ugline&s;s.</HI> As I ima|gine it to be in all re&s;pects the oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e qualities which we have laid down for the con|&s;tituents of beauty. But though ugline&s;s be the oppo&s;ite to beauty, it is not the oppo&s;ite to proportion and fitne&s;s. For it is po&s;&s;ible that a thing may be very ugly with any propor|tions, and with a perfect fitne&s;s to any u&s;es. Ugline&s;s I imagine likewi&s;e to be con&s;i&s;tent enough with an idea of the &s;ublime. But I would by no means in&s;inuate that ugline&s;s of it&s;elf is a &s;ublime idea, unle&s;s united with &s;uch qualities as excite a &s;trong terror.</P>

<P><HI>GRacefulne&s;s</HI> is an idea not very different from beauty; it con&s;i&s;ts in much the &s;ame things.

In this ea&s;e, this roundne&s;s, and de|licacy of attitude and motion, it is that all the magic of grace con&s;i&s;ts, and what is called its <HI>je ne &s;cai quoi,</HI> as will be more obvious to any body who con&s;iders attentively the Venus de Medicis, the Antinous, or any &s;tatue generally allowed to be graceful in an high degree.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXIV. The beautiful in FEELING.</HEAD>
<P>THE foregoing de&s;cription of beauty, &s;o far as is taken in by the eye, may be greatly illu&s;trated by de&s;cribing the nature of objects, which produce a &s;imilar effect through the touch. This I call the beautiful in <HI>Feeling.</HI> It corre&s;ponds wonderfully with what cau&s;es the &s;ame &s;pecies of plea&s;ure to the &s;ight. There is a chain in all our &s;en&s;ations, they are all but different &s;orts of feeling, calculated to be affected by various forts of objects, but
<PB N="109" REF="121">
all to be affected after the &s;ame manner. All bodies that are plea&s;ant to the touch, are &s;o by the &s;lightne&s;s of the re&s;i&s;tance they make. Re|&s;i&s;tance is either to motion along the &s;urface, or to the pre&s;&s;ure of the parts on one another; if the former be &s;light, we call the body, &s;mooth; if the latter, &s;oft. The chief plea&s;ure we receive by feeling, is in the one or the other of the&s;e qualities; and if there be a combination of both, our plea&s;ure is greatly increa&s;ed. This is &s;o plain, that it is rather more fit to illu&s;trate other things, than to be illu&s;trated it&s;elf by any exam|ple. The next &s;ource of plea&s;ure in this &s;en&s;e, as in every other, is the continually pre&s;enting &s;omewhat new; and we find that bodies which continually vary their &s;urface, are much the mo&s;t plea&s;ant, or beautiful, to the feeling, as any one that plea&s;es may experience. The third property in &s;uch objects is, that though the &s;urface continually varies its direction, it never varies it &s;uddenly. The application of any thing &s;udden, even though the impre&s;&s;ion it|&s;elf have little or nothing of violence, is di&s;|agreeable. The quick application of a finger a little warmer or colder than u&s;ual, without notice, makes us &s;tart; a &s;light tap on the &s;houlder, not expected, has the &s;ame effect. Hence it is that angular bodies, bodies that
<PB N="110" REF="122">
&s;uddenly vary the direction of the outline, af|ford &s;o little plea&s;ure to the feeling. Every &s;uch change is a &s;ort of climbing or falling in miniature; &s;o that &s;quares, triangles, and other angular figures, are neither beautiful to the &s;ight nor feeling. Whoever compares his &s;tate of mind, on feeling &s;oft, &s;mooth, va|riated, unangular bodies, with that in which he finds him&s;elf, on the view of a beautiful object, will perceive a very &s;triking analogy in the effects of both; and which may go a good way towards di&s;covering their common cau&s;e. Feeling and &s;ight in this re&s;pect, dif|fer in but a few points. The touch takes in the plea&s;ure of &s;oftne&s;s, which is not primarily an object of &s;ight; the &s;ight on the other hand comprehends colour, which can hardly be made perceptible to the touch; the touch again has the advantage in a new idea of plea&s;ure re&s;ulting from a moderate degree of warmth; but the eye triumphs in the infinite extent and multiplicity of its objects. But there is &s;uch a &s;imilitude in the plea&s;ures of the&s;e &s;en&s;es, that I am apt to fancy, if it were po&s;|&s;ible that one might di&s;cern colour by feeling, (as it is &s;aid &s;ome blind men have done) that the &s;ame colours, and the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition of colouring, which are found beautiful to the
<PB N="111" REF="123">
&s;ight, would be found likewi&s;e mo&s;t grateful to the touch. But &s;etting a&s;ide conjectures, let us pa&s;s to the other &s;en&s;e; of hearing.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXV. The beautiful in SOUNDS.</HEAD>
<P>IN this &s;en&s;e we find an equal aptitude to be affected in a &s;oft and delicate manner; and how far &s;weet or beautiful &s;ounds agree with our de&s;criptions of beauty in other &s;en&s;es, the experience of every one mu&s;t decide. Milton has de&s;cribed this &s;pecies of mu&s;ic in one of his juvenile poems <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Il allegro,</NOTE>. I need not &s;ay that Milton was perfectly well ver&s;ed in that art; and had as fine an ear, with as happy a man|ner of expre&s;&s;ing the affections of one &s;en&s;e by metaphors taken from another, as any man that ever was. The de&s;cription is as follows.
<Q><L>&mdash;And ever again&s;t eating cares,</L>
<L>Lap me in <HI>&s;oft</HI> Lydian airs;</L>

Let us parallel this with the &s;oftne&s;s, the wind|ing &s;urface, the unbroken continuance, the ea&s;y gradation of the beautiful in other things; and all the diver&s;ities of the &s;everal &s;en&s;es, with all their &s;everal affections, will rather help to throw lights from one another to fini&s;h one clear, con&s;i&s;tent idea of the whole, than to ob&s;cure it by their intricacy and variety.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVI. Continued.</HEAD>
<P>TO the abovementioned de&s;cription I &s;hall add one or two remarks. The fir&s;t is; that the beautiful in mu&s;ic will not bear that loudne&s;s and &s;trength of &s;ounds, that may be u&s;ed to rai&s;e other pa&s;&s;ions; nor notes, which are &s;hrill, or har&s;h, or deep; it agrees be&s;t with &s;uch as are clear, even, &s;mooth, and weak. The &s;econd is; that great variety, and quick tran&s;itions from one mea&s;ure or tone to another, are contrary to the genius of the beautiful in mu&s;ic. Such <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>I ne'er am merry, when I hear &s;weet mu&s;ic.<BIBL>SHAKESPEAR.</BIBL></Q></NOTE> tran&s;itions often
<PB N="113" REF="125">
excite mirth, or other &s;udden and tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions; but not that &s;inking, that melting, that languor, which is the characteri&s;tical effect of the beautiful, as it regards every &s;en&s;e. The pa&s;&s;ion excited by beauty is in fact nearer to a &s;pecies of melancholy, than to jol|lity and mirth. I do not here mean to con|fine mu&s;ic to any one &s;pecies of notes, or tones, neither is it an art in which I can &s;ay I have any great &s;kill. My &s;ole de&s;ign in this remark is, to &s;ettle a con&s;i&s;tent idea of beauty. The infinite variety of the affections of the &s;oul will &s;ugge&s;t to a good head, and &s;kilful ear, a va|riety of &s;uch &s;ounds, as are fitted to rai&s;e them. It can be no prejudice to this, to clear and di&s;tingui&s;h &s;ome few particulars, that be|long to the &s;ame cla&s;s, and are con&s;i&s;tent with each other, from the immen&s;e croud of dif|ferent, and &s;ometimes contradictory ideas, that rank vulgarly under the &s;tandard of beau|ty. And of the&s;e it is my intention to mark &s;uch only of the leading points as &s;hew the conformity of the &s;en&s;e of hearing, with all the other &s;en&s;es in the article of their plea&s;ures.</P>

<P>THIS general agreement of the &s;en&s;es is yet more evident on minutely con&s;idering tho&s;e of ta&s;te and &s;mell.

I do not think any thing better fitted to e&s;tabli&s;h a clear and &s;ettled idea of vi&s;ual beauty, than this way of examining the &s;imilar plea&s;ures of other &s;en&s;es; for one part is &s;ometimes clear in one of the &s;en&s;es, that is more ob&s;cure in another; and where there is a clear concurrence of all, we may with more certainty &s;peak of any one of them.

They are indeed ideas of a very different nature, one being founded on pain, the other on plea&s;ure; and however they may vary afterwards from the direct nature of their cau&s;es, yet the&s;e cau&s;es keep up an eternal di&s;tinction between them, a di&s;tinction never to be forgotten by any who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to affect the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I. Of the efficient cau&s;e of the SUBLIME and BEAUTIFUL.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I &s;ay, I intend to enquire into the efficient cau&s;e of &s;ubli|mity and beauty, I would not be under&s;tood to &s;ay, that I can come to the ul|timate cau&s;e. I do not pretend that I &s;hall ever be able to explain, why certain affections of the body produce &s;uch a di&s;tinct emotion of mind, and no other; or why the body is at all af|fected by the mind, or the mind by the body. A little thought will &s;hew this to be impo&s;&s;ible.
<PB N="118" REF="129">
But I conceive, if we can di&s;cover what af|fections of the mind produce certain emo|tions of the body; and what di&s;tinct feelings and qualities of body &s;hall produce certain determinate pa&s;&s;ions in the mind, and no others, I fancy a great deal will be done; &s;omething not unu&s;eful towards a di&s;tinct knowledge of our pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o far at lea&s;t as we have them at pre&s;ent under our con&s;ide|ration. This is all, I believe, we can do. If we could advance a &s;tep farther, difficulties would &s;till remain, as we &s;hould be &s;till equally di&s;tant from the fir&s;t cau&s;e. When Newton fir&s;t di&s;covered the property of attrac|tion, and &s;ettled its laws, he found it &s;erved very well to explain &s;everal of the mo&s;t re|markable phaenomena in nature; but yet with reference to the general &s;y&s;tem of things, he could con&s;ider attraction but as an effect, who&s;e cau&s;e at that time he did not attempt to trace. But when he afterwards began to account for it by a &s;ubtle ela&s;tic aether, this great man (if in &s;o great a man it be not im|pious to di&s;cover any thing like a blemi&s;h) &s;eemed to have quitted his u&s;ual cautious man|ner of philo&s;ophi&s;ing; &s;ince, perhaps, allowing all that has been advanced on this &s;ubject to be &s;ufficiently proved, I think it leaves us with as many difficulties as it found us. That
<PB N="119" REF="130">
great chain of cau&s;es, which linking one to another even to the throne of God him&s;elf, can never be unravelled by any indu&s;try of ours. When we go but one &s;tep beyond the immediately &s;en&s;ible qualities of things, we go out of our depth. All we do after, is but a faint &s;truggle, that &s;hews we are in an ele|ment, that does not belong to us. So that when I &s;peak of cau&s;e, and efficient cau&s;e, I only mean, certain affections of the mind, that cau&s;e certain changes in the body; or certain powers and properties in bodies, that work a change in the mind. As if I were to explain the motion of a body falling to the ground, I would &s;ay it was cau&s;ed by gravity, and I would en|deavour to &s;hew after what manner this power operated, without attempting to &s;hew why it operated in this manner; or if I were to ex|plain the effects of bodies &s;triking one another by the common laws of percu&s;&s;ion, I &s;hould not endeavour to explain how motion it&s;elf is communicated.</P>

<P>IT is no &s;mall bar in the way of our enqui|ries into the cau&s;es of the pa&s;&s;ions, that the occa&s;ion of many of them are given, and that their governing motions are impre&s;&s;ed at a time when we have not capacity to reflect on them; at a time of which all &s;orts of memory is worn out of our minds. For be&s;ides &s;uch things as affect us in various manners according to their natural powers, there are a&s;&s;ociations made at that early &s;ea&s;on, which we find it very hard afterwards to di&s;tingui&s;h from natural effects. Not to mention the unaccountable antipathies which we find in many per&s;ons, we all find it impo&s;&s;ible to remember when a &s;teep became more terrible than a plain; or fire or water more dreadful than a clod of earth; though all the&s;e are very probably either conclu&s;ions from experience, or ari&s;ing from the premonitions of others; and &s;ome of them impre&s;&s;ed, in all likelihood, pretty late.

<HEAD>SECT. III. Cau&s;e of PAIN and FEAR.</HEAD>
<P>I Have before ob&s;erved, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Part 1. &s;ect. 8.</NOTE> that whatever is qualified to cau&s;e terror, is a foundation capable of the &s;ublime; to which I add, that not only the&s;e, but many things from which we cannot probably apprehend any danger have a &s;imilar effect, becau&s;e they operate in a &s;imilar manner. I ob&s;erved too, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part 1. &s;ect. 10.</NOTE> whatever produces plea&s;ure, po&s;itive and ori|ginal plea&s;ure, is fit to have beauty engrafted on it. Therefore, to clear up the nature of the&s;e qualities, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to explain the nature of pain and plea&s;ure on which they depend. A man who &s;uffers under violent bodily pain; (I &s;uppo&s;e the mo&s;t violent, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="122" REF="133">
the effect may be the more obvious.) I &s;ay a man in pain has his teeth &s;et, his eye|brows are violently contracted, his forehead is wrinkled, his eyes are dragged inwards, and rolled with great vehemence, his hair &s;tands an end, the voice is forced out in &s;hort &s;hrieks and groans, and the whole fabric totters. Fear or terror, which is an apprehen&s;ion of pain or death, exhibits exactly the &s;ame effects, ap|proaching in violence to tho&s;e ju&s;t mentioned in proportion to the nearne&s;s of the cau&s;e, and the weakne&s;s of the &s;ubject. This is not only &s;o in the human &s;pecies, but I have more than once ob&s;erved in dogs, under an appre|hen&s;ion of puni&s;hment, that they have writh|ed their bodies, and yelped, and howled, as if they had actually felt the blows. From hence I conclude that pain, and fear, act upon the the &s;ame parts of the body, and in the &s;ame manner, though &s;omewhat differing in degree. That pain and fear con&s;i&s;t in an unnatural ten&s;ion of the nerves; that this is &s;ometimes accompanied with an unnatural &s;trength, which &s;ometimes &s;uddenly changes into an ex|traordinary weakne&s;s; that the&s;e effects often come on alternately, and &s;ometimes mixed with each other. This is the nature of all convul&s;ive agitations, e&s;pecially in weaker &s;ub|jects,
<PB N="123" REF="134">
which are the mo&s;t liable to the &s;e|vere&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of pain and fear. The only difference between pain and terror, is, that things which cau&s;e pain operate on the mind, by the intervention of the body; whereas things that cau&s;e terror generally affect the bodily organs by the operation of the mind &s;ugge&s;ting the danger; but both agreeing, either primarily, or &s;econdarily, in producing a ten&s;ion, contraction, or violent emotion of the nerves <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">I do not here enter into the que&s;tion debated among phy&s;iologi&s;ts, whether pain be the effect of a contraction, or a ten&s;ion of the nerves.

<P>TO this purpo&s;e Mr. Spon, in the Re|cherches d' Antiquite, gives us a cu|rious &s;tory of the celebrated phy&s;iognomi&s;t Campanella; this man, it &s;eems, had not only made very accurate ob&s;ervations on hu|man faces, but was very expert in mimick|ing &s;uch, as were any way remarkable. When he had a mind to penetrate into the inclinations of tho&s;e he had to deal with, he compo&s;ed his face, his ge&s;ture, and his whole body, as nearly as he could into the ex|act &s;imilitude of the per&s;on he intended to ex|amine; and then carefully ob&s;erved what turn of mind he &s;eemed to acquire by this change. So that, &s;ays my author, he was able to enter into the di&s;po&s;itions and thoughts of people, as effectually as if he had been changed into the very men. I have often ob&s;erved, that on mimicking the looks and ge&s;tures, of angry, or placid, or frighted, or daring men, I have involuntarily found my mind turned to that pa&s;&s;ion who&s;e appearance I endeavoured to imitate; nay, I am convinced it is hard to avoid it; though one &s;trove to &s;eparate the
<PB N="125" REF="136">

So that, though the image of one point &s;hould cau&s;e but a &s;mall ten&s;ion of this membrane, ano|ther, and another, and another &s;troke, mu&s;t

<P>IT may be objected to this theory, that the eye generally receives an equal number of rays at all times, and that therefore a great object cannot affect it by the number of rays, more than that variety of objects which the eye mu&s;t always di&s;cern whil&s;t it remains open. But to this I an&s;wer, that admitting an equal number of rays, or an equal quantity of lu|minous particles to &s;trike the eye at all times, yet if the&s;e rays frequently vary their nature, now to blue, now to red, and &s;o on, or their manner of termination as to a number of petty &s;quares, triangles, or the like, at every change, whether of colour or &s;hape, the organ has a &s;ort of relaxation or re&s;t, which prevents that ten&s;ion, that &s;pecies of labour which is allied to pain, and cau&s;es the &s;ublime. For the &s;um total of things of various kinds, though it &s;hould equal the number of the uniform parts compo&s;ing &s;ome <HI>one</HI> entire object, is not e|qual in its effect upon the organs of our bodies. It is next to re&s;t in all things, to vary our la|bour; and it is not &s;o only in our labours, but in our &s;tudies. Be&s;ides this, there is a very &s;trong rea&s;on for the difference. The mind
<PB N="134" REF="145">
in reality hardly ever can attend diligently to more than one thing at a time; if this thing be little, the effect is little, and a number of other little objects cannot engage the atten|tion; the mind is bounded by the bounds of the object; and what is not attended to, and what does not exi&s;t, are much the &s;ame in the effect; but the eye or the mind (for in this ca&s;e there is no difference) in great uniform ob|jects does not readily arrive at their bounds; it has no re&s;t, whil&s;t it contemplates them; the image is much the &s;ame every where.

is rather more obvious in the &s;en&s;e of hearing. And I &s;hall here once for all ob|&s;erve, that an inve&s;tigation of the natural and mechanical cau&s;es of our pa&s;&s;ions, be&s;ides the curio&s;ity of the &s;ubject, gives, if they are di&s;covered, a double &s;trength and lu&s;tre to any rules we deliver on &s;uch matters. When the ear receives any &s;imple &s;ound, it is &s;truck by a &s;ingle pul&s;e of the air, which makes the ear-drum and the other membranous parts vi|brate according to the nature and &s;pecies of the &s;troke. If the &s;troke be &s;trong, the organ of hearing &s;uffers a con&s;iderable degree of ten&s;ion. If the &s;troke be repeated pretty &s;oon after; the repetition cau&s;es an expectation of another &s;troke. And it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that expectation it&s;elf cau&s;es a ten&s;ion. This is apparent in many animals, who, when they prepare for hearing any &s;ound, rou&s;e them|&s;elves, and prick up their ears; &s;o that here the effect of the &s;ounds is con&s;iderably aug|mented by a new auxiliary, the expectation. But though after a number of &s;trokes, we ex|pect &s;till more, not being able to a&s;certain the exact time of their arrival, when they arrive, they produce a &s;ort of &s;urpri&s;e, which in|crea&s;es this ten&s;ion yet further. For, I have ob&s;erved, that when at any time I have wait|ed very earne&s;tly for &s;ome &s;ound, that return|ed at intervals, (as the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive firing of

cannon) though I fully expected the return of the &s;ound, when it came, it always made me &s;tart a little; the ear-drum &s;uffered a convul|&s;ion, and the whole body con&s;ented with it. The ten&s;ion of the part thus increa&s;ing at every blow, by the united forces of the &s;troke it&s;elf, the expectation, and the &s;urpri&s;e, it is worked up to &s;uch a pitch as to be capable of the &s;ublime; it is brought ju&s;t to the verge of pain. Even when the cau&s;e has cea&s;ed; the organs of hearing being often &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;truck in a &s;imilar manner, continue to vibrate in that manner for &s;ome time longer; this is an additional help to the greatne&s;s of the effect.</P>

To avoid the perplexity of general notions; let us &s;et before our eyes a colonnade of uniform pillars planted in a right
<PB N="138" REF="149">
line; let us take our &s;tand, in &s;uch a man|ner, that the eye may &s;hoot along this colon|nade, for it has its be&s;t effect in this view. In our pre&s;ent &s;ituation it is plain, that the rays from the fir&s;t round pillar will cau&s;e in the eye a vibration of that &s;pecies; an image of the pillar it&s;elf. The pillar immediately &s;ucceeding in|crea&s;es it; that which follows renews and en|forces the impre&s;&s;ion; each in its order as it &s;ucceeds, repeats impul&s;e after impul&s;e, and &s;troke after &s;troke, until the eye long exerci&s;ed in one particular way cannot lo&s;e that object immediately; and being violently rou&s;ed by this continued agitation, it pre&s;ents the mind with a grand or &s;ublime conception. But in|&s;tead of viewing a rank of uniform pillars; let us &s;uppo&s;e, that they &s;ucceed each other, a round and a &s;quare one alternately. In this ca&s;e the vibration cau&s;ed by the fir&s;t round pillar peri&s;hes as &s;oon as it is formed; and one of quite another &s;ort (the &s;quare) directly occupies its place; which however it re&s;igns as quickly to the round one; and thus the eye proceeds, al|ternately, taking up one image and laying down another, as long as the building continues. From whence it is obvious, that at the la&s;t pillar, the impre&s;&s;ion is as far from continuing as it was at the very fir&s;t; becau&s;e in fact, the &s;en&s;ory can receive no di&s;tinct impre&s;&s;ion but from
<PB N="139" REF="150">
the la&s;t; and it can never of it&s;elf re&s;ume a di&s;&s;imilar impre&s;&s;ion: be&s;ides, every variation of the object is a re&s;t and relaxation to the or|gans of &s;ight; and the&s;e reliefs prevent that violent emotion &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to produce the &s;ublime. To produce therefore a perfect grandeur in &s;uch things as we have been men|tioning, there &s;hould be a perfect &s;implicity, an ab&s;olute uniformity in di&s;po&s;ition, &s;hape and colouring. Upon this principle of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and uniformity it may be a&s;ked, why a long bare wall &s;hould not be a more &s;ublime object than a colonnade; &s;ince the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is no way interrupted; &s;ince the eye meets no check; &s;ince nothing more uniform can be conceived? A long bare wall is certainly not &s;o grand an object as a colonnade of the &s;ame length and height. It is not altogether difficult to account for this difference. When we look at a naked wall, from the evenne&s;s of the object, the eye runs along its whole &s;pace, and arrives quick|ly at its termination; the eye meets nothing which may interrupt its progre&s;s; but then it meets nothing which may detain it a proper time to produce a very great and la&s;ting effect. The view of a bare wall, if it be of a great height and length, is undoubtedly grand: but this is only <HI>one</HI> idea, and not a <HI>repetition</HI> of <HI>&s;imilar</HI> ideas; it is therefore great, not &s;o much

Among many remarkable particulars that attended his fir&s;t perceptions, and judg|ments on vi&s;ual objects, Che&s;elden tells us, that the fir&s;t time the boy &s;aw a black object, it gave him great unea&s;ine&s;s; and that &s;ome time after, upon accidentally &s;eeing a negro woman, he was &s;truck with great horror at the &s;ight. The horror, in this ca&s;e, can &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from any a&s;&s;ocia|tion. The boy appears by the account to be particularly ob&s;erving, and &s;en&s;ible for one of his age: and therefore, it is probable, if the great unea&s;ine&s;s he felt at the fir&s;t fight of black had ari&s;en from its connexion with any other di&s;agreeable ideas, he would have ob&s;erved and mentioned it. For an idea, di&s;agreeable only by a&s;&s;ociation, has the cau&s;e of its ill ef|fect on the pa&s;&s;ions evident enough at the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion; in ordinary ca&s;es, it is indeed fre|quently lo&s;t; but this is, becau&s;e the original a&s;&s;ociation was made very early, and the con|&s;equent impre&s;&s;ion repeated often. In our in&s;tance, there was no time for &s;uch an habit; and there is no rea&s;on to think, that the ill effects of black on his imagination were more owing to its connexion with any di&s;agreeable ideas, than that the good effects of more cheerful colours were derived from their con|nexion

<HEAD>SECT. XVI. The cau&s;e why DARKNESS is terrible.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be worth while to examine, how darkne&s;s can operate in &s;uch a manner as to cau&s;e pain; that is, to produce a ten&s;ion in tho&s;e nerves, which form the organs of &s;ight. It may be ob&s;erved, that &s;till as we recede from the light, nature has &s;o contrived it, that the pupil is enlarged by the retiring of the iris, in proportion to our rece&s;s. Now in|&s;tead of declining from it but a little, &s;uppo&s;e that we withdraw entirely from the light; it is rea&s;onable to think, that the expan&s;ion of the iris is proportionably greater, and that this part may by great darkne&s;s come to be &s;o expanded, as to &s;tretch the nerves that compo&s;e it far beyond their natural tone; and by this means to produce a painful &s;en&s;ation. Such a ten&s;ion it &s;eems there certainly is, whil&s;t we are involved in darkne&s;s; for in &s;uch a &s;tate whil&s;t the eye remains open, there is a continual ni&s;us to receive light, as appears by the fla&s;hes, and luminous appearances which often

It may perhaps be objected, that the ill effects of darkne&s;s or blackne&s;s &s;eem rather mental than corporeal; and I own it is true, that they do &s;o; and &s;o do all tho&s;e that depend on the affections of the finer parts of our &s;y&s;tem. The ill effects of bad weather appear often no otherwi&s;e, than in a melancholy and dejection of &s;pirits, though without doubt, in this ca&s;e, the bodily organs &s;uffer fir&s;t, and the mind through the&s;e organs.</P>

<P>BLackne&s;s is but a <HI>partial darkne&s;s</HI>; and therefore it derives &s;ome of its powers from being mixed and &s;urrounded with coloured bodies. In its own nature, it cannot be con|&s;idered as a colour. Black bodies, reflecting none, or but a few rays, with regard to &s;ight, are but as &s;o many vacant &s;paces di&s;per&s;ed among the objects we view. When the eye
<PB N="146" REF="157">
lights on one of the&s;e vacuities, after having been kept in &s;ome degree of ten&s;ion by the play of the adjacent colours upon it, it &s;udden|ly falls into a relaxation; out of which it as &s;uddenly recovers by a convul&s;ive &s;pring. To illu&s;trate this; let us con&s;ider, that when we intend to &s;it on a chair, and find it much lower than was expected, the &s;hock is very violent; much more violent than could be thought from &s;o &s;light a fall as the difference between one chair and another can po&s;&s;ibly make. Or if, after de&s;cending a flight of &s;tairs, we attempt inadvertently to take another &s;tep in the manner of the former ones, the &s;hock is extreamly rude and di&s;agreeable; and by no art, can we cau&s;e &s;uch a &s;hock by the &s;ame means, when we expect and prepare for it. When I &s;ay, that this is owing to having the change made contrary to expectation; I do not mean &s;olely, when the <HI>mind</HI> expects. I mean likewi&s;e, that when any organ of &s;en&s;e is for &s;ome time affected in &s;ome one manner, if it be &s;uddenly affected otherwi&s;e there en&s;ues a con|vul&s;ive motion; &s;uch a convul&s;ion as is cau&s;ed when any thing happens again&s;t the expectance of the mind. And though it may appear &s;trange that &s;uch a change as produces a relaxation, &s;hould immediately produce a &s;udden convul|&s;ion; it is yet mo&s;t certainly &s;o, and &s;o in all
<PB N="147" REF="158">
the &s;en&s;es. Every one knows that &s;leep is a relaxation; and that &s;ilence, where nothing keeps the organs of hearing in action, is in general fitte&s;t to bring on this relaxation; yet when a &s;ort of murmuring &s;ounds di&s;po&s;e a man to &s;leep, let the&s;e &s;ounds cea&s;e &s;uddenly, and the per&s;on immediately awakes; that is, the parts are braced up &s;uddenly, and he awakes. This I have often experienced my|&s;elf, and I have heard the &s;ame from ob&s;erv|ing per&s;ons. In like manner, if a per&s;on in broad day light were falling a&s;leep, to in|troduce a &s;udden darkne&s;s would prevent his &s;leep for that time, though &s;ilence and darkne&s;s in them&s;elves, and not &s;uddenly in|troduced, are very favourable to it. This I knew only by conjecture on the analogy of the &s;en&s;es when I fir&s;t dige&s;ted the&s;e ob&s;ervations; but I have &s;ince experienced it. And I have often ex|perienced, and &s;o have a thou&s;and others; that on the fir&s;t declining towards &s;leep, we have been &s;uddenly awaked with a mo&s;t violent &s;tart; and that this &s;tart was generally pre|ceded by a &s;ort of dream of our falling down a precipice: whence does this &s;trange motion ari&s;e; but from the too &s;udden relaxation of the body, which by &s;ome mechani&s;m in na|ture re&s;tores it&s;elf by as quick and vigorous an exertion of the contracting power of the mu&s;|cles? the dream it&s;elf is cau&s;ed by this relaxa|tion;

and it is of too uniform nature to be attributed to any other cau&s;e. The parts re|lax &s;oo &s;uddenly, which is in the nature of falling; and this accident of the body induces this image in the mind.

<P>THOUGH the effects of black be pain|ful originally, we mu&s;t not think they always continue &s;o. Cu&s;tom reconciles us to every thing.

<HEAD>SECT. XIX. The phy&s;ical cau&s;e of LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we have before us &s;uch objects as excite love and complacency, the body is affected, &s;o far as I could ob&s;erve, much in the following manner. The head reclines &s;omething on one &s;ide; the eyelids are more clo&s;ed than u&s;ual, and the eyes roll gently with an inclination to the object, the mouth is a little opened, and the breath drawn &s;lowly, with now and then a low &s;igh: the whole body is compo&s;ed, and the hands fall
<PB N="150" REF="161">
idly to the &s;ides. All this is accompanied with an inward &s;en&s;e of melting and languor. The&s;e appearances are always proportioned to the degree of beauty in the object, and of &s;en&s;ibility in the ob&s;erver. And this gradation from the highe&s;t pitch of beauty and &s;en&s;ibility, even to the lowe&s;t of mediocrity and indiffe|rence, and their corre&s;pondent effects, ought to be kept in view, el&s;e this de&s;cription will &s;eem exaggerated, which it certainly is not. But from this de&s;cription it is almo&s;t impo&s;|&s;ible not to conclude, that beauty acts by re|laxing the &s;olids of the whole &s;y&s;tem. There are all the appearances of &s;uch a relaxation; and a relaxation &s;omewhat below the natural tone &s;eems to me to be the cau&s;e of all po&s;i|tive plea&s;ure. This will, I conceive, appear beyond any rea&s;onable doubt, if we can &s;hew that &s;uch things as we have already ob&s;erved to be the genuine con&s;tituents of beauty, have each of them &s;eparately taken a natural ten|dency to relax the fibres. And if it be allowed us, that the appearance of the human body, when all the&s;e properties are united together before the &s;en&s;ory, further favours this opini|on, we may venture, I believe, to conclude, that the pa&s;&s;ion called love is produced by this relaxation. By the &s;ame method of rea&s;on|ing, which we have u&s;ed in the enquiry into
<PB N="151" REF="162">
the cau&s;es of the &s;ublime, we may likewi&s;e conclude, that as a beautiful object pre&s;ented to the &s;en&s;e, by cau&s;ing a relaxation in the body, produces the pa&s;&s;ion of love in the mind; &s;o if by any means the pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould fir&s;t have its origin in the mind, a relaxation of the out|ward organs will as certainly en&s;ue in a degree proportioned to the cau&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XX. Why SMOOTHNESS is beautiful.</HEAD>
<P>IT is to explain the true cau&s;e of vi&s;ual beauty, that I call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other &s;en&s;es. If it appears that <HI>&s;moothne&s;s</HI> is a principal cau&s;e of plea&s;ure to the touch, ta&s;te, &s;mell, and hearing, it will be ea&s;ily admitted a con&s;tituent of vi&s;ual beauty, e&s;pecially as we have before &s;hewn, that this quality is found almo&s;t without exception in all bodies that are by general con&s;ent held beautiful. Now with re&s;pect to the &s;en&s;e of <HI>feeling,</HI> there can be no doubt that bodies which are rough and angular, rou&s;e and vellicate the parts, cau&s;ing a &s;en&s;e of pain, which con&s;i&s;ts in the violent ten|&s;ion or contraction of the mu&s;cular fibres. On the contrary, the application of &s;mooth bodies relax; gentle &s;troking with a &s;mooth hand al|lays
<PB N="152" REF="163">
violent pains and cramps, and relaxes the &s;uffering parts from their unnatural ten&s;ion; and it has therefore very often no mean ef|fect in removing &s;wellings and ob&s;tructions. The &s;en&s;e of feeling is highly gratified with &s;mooth bodies. A bed &s;moothly laid, and &s;oft, that is, where the re&s;i&s;tance is every way incon&s;iderable, is a great luxury, di&s;po&s;ing to an univer&s;al relaxation, and inducing be|yond any thing el&s;e, that &s;pecies of it called &s;leep.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="21" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XXI. SWEETNESS, its nature.</HEAD>
<P>NOR is it only in the touch, that &s;mooth bodies cau&s;e po&s;itive plea&s;ure by relax|ation. In the &s;mell and ta&s;te, we find all things agreeable to them, and which are commonly called &s;weet, to be of a &s;mooth na|ture, and that they all evidently tend to relax their re&s;pective &s;en&s;ories. Let us fir&s;t con|&s;ider the ta&s;te. Since it is mo&s;t ea&s;y to en|quire into the property of liquids, and &s;ince all things &s;eem to want a fluid vehicle to make them ta&s;ted at all, I intend rather to con&s;ider the liquid than the &s;olid parts of our food. The vehicles of all ta&s;tes are <HI>water</HI> and <HI>oil.</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="164">
And what determines the ta&s;te is &s;ome &s;alt, which affects variou&s;ly according to its nature, or its manner of being combined with other things. Water and oil &s;imply con&s;idered are capable of giving &s;ome plea&s;ure to the ta&s;te. Water, when &s;imple, is in&s;ipid, inodorous, colourle&s;s, and &s;mooth, it is found when <HI>not cold</HI> to be a great re&s;olver of &s;pa&s;ms, and lu|bricator of the fibres; this power it probably owes to its &s;moothne&s;s. For as fluidity de|pends, according to the mo&s;t general opinion, on the roundne&s;s, &s;moothne&s;s, and weak co|he&s;ion of the component parts of any body; and as water acts merely as a &s;imple fluid, it follows, that the cau&s;e of its fluidity is like|wi&s;e the cau&s;e of its relaxing quality; namely, the &s;moothne&s;s and &s;lippery texture of its parts. The other fluid vehicle of ta&s;tes is <HI>oil.</HI> This too, when &s;imple, is &s;omewhat in&s;ipid, inodorous, colourle&s;s, and &s;mooth to the touch and ta&s;te. It is &s;moother than water, and in many ca&s;es yet more relaxing. Oil is in &s;ome degree plea&s;ant to the eye, the touch and the ta&s;te, in&s;ipid as it is. Water is not &s;o grateful, which I do not know on what principle to account for, other than that that water is not &s;o &s;oft and &s;mooth. Suppo&s;e that to this oil or water were added a certain quantity of a &s;pecific &s;alt, which had a power of putting
<PB N="154" REF="165">
the nervous papillae of the tongue into a gentle vibratory motion; as &s;uppo&s;e &s;ugar di&s;&s;olved in it. The &s;moothne&s;s of the oil, and the vibratory power of the &s;alt, cau&s;e the &s;en&s;e we call &s;weetne&s;s. In all &s;weet bodies, &s;ugar, or a &s;ub&s;tance very little different from &s;ugar, is con&s;tantly found; every &s;pecies of &s;alt ex|amined by the micro&s;cope has its own di&s;tinct, regular, invariable form. That of nitre is a pointed oblong; that of &s;ea &s;alt an exact cube; that of &s;ugar a perfect globe. If you have tried how &s;mooth globular bodies, as the marbles with which boys amu&s;e them&s;elves, have affected the touch when they are rolled backward and forward and over one another, you will ea&s;ily conceive how &s;weetne&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;alt of &s;uch nature, affects the ta&s;te; for a &s;ingle globe, though &s;omewhat plea&s;ant to the feeling, by the regularity of its form, and the &s;omewhat too &s;udden deviation of its parts from a right line, is nothing near &s;o plea&s;ant to the touch as &s;everal globes, where the hand gently ri&s;es to one and falls to another; and this plea&s;ure is greatly increa&s;ed if the globes are in motion, and &s;liding over one another; for this &s;oft variety prevents that wearine&s;s, which the uniform di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;everal globes would otherwi&s;e produce. Thus in &s;weet liquors, the parts of the fluid vehicle
<PB N="155" REF="166">
though mo&s;t probably round, are yet &s;o minute as to conceal the figure of their component parts from the nice&s;t inqui&s;ition of the micro|&s;cope; and con&s;equently being &s;o exce&s;&s;ively minute, they have a &s;ort of flat &s;implicity to the ta&s;te, re&s;embling the effects of plain &s;mooth bodies to the touch; for if a body be compo&s;ed of round parts exce&s;&s;ively &s;mall, and packed pretty clo&s;ely together, the &s;urface will be both to the &s;ight and touch as if it were nearly plain and &s;mooth. It is clear from their unveiling their figure to the micro&s;cope, that the particles of &s;ugar are con&s;iderably larger than tho&s;e of water or oil, and con&s;e|quently that their effects from their roundne&s;s will be more di&s;tinct and palpable to the ner|vous papillae of that nice organ the tongue: they will induce that &s;en&s;e called &s;weetne&s;s, which in a weak manner we di&s;cover in oil, and in a yet weaker in water; for in&s;ipid as they are, water and oil are in &s;ome degree &s;weet; and it may be ob&s;erved, that in&s;ipid things of all kinds approach more nearly to the nature of &s;weetne&s;s than to that of any other ta&s;te.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXII. SWEETNESS relaxing.</HEAD>
<P>IN the other &s;en&s;es we have remarked, that &s;mooth things are relaxing. Now it ought to appear that &s;weet things, which are the &s;mooth of ta&s;te, are relaxing too. That &s;weet things are generally &s;o is evident, becau&s;e all &s;uch, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which are mo&s;t oily, taken frequently or in a large quantity, very much enfeeble the tone of the &s;tomach. Sweet &s;mells, which bear a great affinity to &s;weet ta&s;tes, relax very remarkably. The &s;mell of flowers di&s;po&s;es people to drow&s;ine&s;s; and this relaxing effect is further apparent from the pre|judice which people of weak nerves receive from their u&s;e. It were worth while to examine, whether ta&s;tes of this kind, &s;weet ones, ta&s;tes that are cau&s;ed by &s;mooth oils and a relaxing &s;alt are not the originally plea&s;ant ta&s;tes. For many which u&s;e has rendered &s;uch, were not at all agreeable at fir&s;t. The way to examine this is, to try what nature has originally pro|vided for us, which &s;he has undoubtedly made originally plea&s;ant: and to analy&s;e this provi|&s;ion. <HI>Milk</HI> is the fir&s;t &s;upport of our childhood. The component parts of this are water, oil,
<PB N="157" REF="168">
and a &s;ort of a very &s;weet &s;alt called the &s;ugar of milk. All the&s;e when blended have a great <HI>&s;moothne&s;s</HI> to the ta&s;te, and a relaxing quality to the &s;kin. The next thing children covet is <HI>fruit,</HI> and of fruits, tho&s;e principally which are &s;weet; and every one knows that the &s;weetne&s;s of fruit is cau&s;ed by a &s;ubtle oil and &s;uch a &s;alt as that mentioned in the la&s;t &s;ection. Afterwards, cu&s;tom, habit, the de&s;ire of novelty, and a thou&s;and other cau&s;es, &s;o mix, adulte|rate, and change our palates, that we can no longer rea&s;on with any &s;atisfaction about them. Before we quit this article we mu&s;t ob&s;erve; that as &s;mooth things are, as &s;uch, agreeable to the ta&s;te, and are found of a re|laxing quality; &s;o on the other hand, things which are found by experience to be of a &s;trengthening quality, and fit to brace the fibres, are almo&s;t univer&s;ally rough and pungent to the ta&s;te, and in many ca&s;es rough even to the touch. We often apply the quality of &s;weet|ne&s;s, metaphorically, to vi&s;ual objects. For the better carrying on this remarkable analogy of the &s;en&s;es, we may here call &s;weetne&s;s the beautiful of the ta&s;te.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXIII. VARIATION, why beautiful.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER principal property of beau|tiful objects is, that the line of their parts is continually varying its direction; but it varies it by a very in&s;en&s;ible deviation, it never varies it &s;o quickly as to &s;urpri&s;e, or by the &s;harpne&s;s of its angle to cau&s;e any twitch|ing or convul&s;ion of the optic nerve. Nothing long continued in the &s;ame manner, nothing very &s;uddenly varied can be beautiful; becau&s;e both are oppo&s;ite to that agreeable relaxation, which is the characteri&s;tic effect of beauty. It is thus in all the &s;en&s;es. A motion in a right line, is that manner of moving next to a very gentle de&s;cent, in which we meet the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, yet it is not that manner of moving, which next to a de&s;cent, wearies us the lea&s;t. Re&s;t certainly tends to relax; yet there is a &s;pecies of motion which relaxes more than re&s;t; a gentle o&s;cillatory motion, a ri&s;ing and falling. Rocking &s;ets children to &s;leep better than ab&s;olute re&s;t; there is indeed &s;carce any thing at that age, which gives more plea&s;ure than to be gently lifted up and down; the manner of playing which their nur&s;es u&s;e
<PB N="159" REF="170">
with children, and the weighing and &s;winging u&s;ed afterwards by them&s;elves as a favourite a|mu&s;ement, evince this very &s;ufficiently. Mo&s;t people mu&s;t have ob&s;erved the &s;ort of &s;en&s;e they have had, on being &s;wiftly drawn in an ea&s;y coach, on a &s;mooth turf, with gradual a&s;cents and declivities. This will give a better idea of the beautiful, and point out its probable cau&s;e better than almo&s;t any thing el&s;e. On the contrary; when one is hurried over a rough, rocky, broken road, the pain felt by the&s;e &s;udden inequalities &s;hews why &s;imilar &s;ights, feelings and &s;ounds, are &s;o contrary to beau|ty; and with regard to the feeling, it is ex|actly the &s;ame in its effect, or very nearly the &s;ame, whether, for in&s;tance, I move my hand along the &s;urface of a body of a certain &s;hape, or whether &s;uch a body is moved along my hand. But to bring this analogy of the &s;en&s;es home to the eye; if a body pre&s;ented to that &s;en&s;e has &s;uch a waving &s;urface that the rays of light reflected from it are in a continual in&s;en&s;ible deviation from the &s;tronge&s;t to the weake&s;t, which is always the ca&s;e in a &s;urface gradually unequal, it mu&s;t be exactly &s;imilar in its effect on the eye and touch; one of which operates on it directly, on the other indirectly. And this body will be beautiful if the lines which compo&s;e its &s;urface are not

It is true, that having once fixed the &s;pecies of any object, and the dimen&s;ions common in the individuals of that &s;pecies, we may ob&s;erve &s;ome that exceed, and &s;ome that fall &s;hort of the ordinary &s;tandard: the&s;e which greatly exceed, are by that exce&s;s, provided the &s;pecies it&s;elf be not very &s;mall, rather great and terrible than beautiful; but as in the animal world, and in a good mea&s;ure in the vegetable world like|wi&s;e, the qualities that con&s;titute beauty may po&s;&s;ibly be united to things of greater dimen|&s;ions;
<PB N="161" REF="172">
when they are &s;o united they con&s;titute a &s;pecies &s;omething different both from the &s;ub|lime and beautiful, which I have before call|ed <HI>Fine</HI>; but this kind I imagine has not &s;uch a power on the pa&s;&s;ions, either as va&s;t bodies have which are endued with the corre&s;pondent qualities of the &s;ublime; or as the qualities of beauty have when united in a &s;mall object. The affection produced by large bodies adorned with the &s;poils of beauty, is a ten&s;ion continually re|lieved; which approaches nearer to the na|ture of mediocrity. But if I were to &s;ay how I find my&s;elf affected upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, I &s;hould &s;ay, that the &s;ublime &s;uffers le&s;s by be|ing united to &s;ome of the qualities of beauty, than beauty does by being joined to greatne&s;s of quantity, or any other properties of the &s;ublime. There is &s;omething &s;o over-ruling in whatever in&s;pires us with awe, in all things which belong ever &s;o remotely to terror, that nothing el&s;e can &s;tand in their pre&s;ence. There lie the qualities of beauty either dead and unoperative; or at mo&s;t exerted to mollify the rigour and &s;ternne&s;s of the terror, which is the natural concomitant of greatne&s;s. Be&s;ides the extraordinary great in every &s;pecies, the oppo&s;ite to this, the dwarfi&s;h and diminutive ought to be con&s;idered. Lit|tlene&s;s, merely as &s;uch, has nothing contrary to the idea of beauty. The humming bird both
<PB N="162" REF="173">
in &s;hape and colouring yields to none of the winged &s;pecies, of which it is the lea&s;t; and perhaps his beauty is enhanced by his &s;mall|ne&s;s. But there are animals, which when they are extremely &s;mall are rarely (if ever) beautiful. There is a dwarfi&s;h &s;ize of men and women, which is almo&s;t con&s;tantly &s;o gro&s;s and ma&s;&s;ive in compari&s;on of their height, that they pre&s;ent us with a very di&s;agree|able image. But if a man was found not above two or three feet high, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a per&s;on to have all the parts of his body of a delicacy &s;uitable to &s;uch a &s;ize, and other|wi&s;e endued with the common qualities of other beautiful bodies; I am pretty well convinced that a per&s;on of &s;uch a &s;tature might well be con&s;idered as beautiful; might be the object of love; might give us very plea&s;ing ideas on viewing him. The only thing which could po&s;&s;ibly interpo&s;e to check this plea&s;ure is, that &s;uch creatures, however formed, are unu&s;ual, and are often therefore con&s;idered as &s;omething mon&s;trous. The large and gigantic, though very compatible with the &s;ublime, is contrary to the beautiful. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e a giant to be the object of love. When we let our imaginations loo&s;e in romance, the ideas we naturally annex to that &s;ize are tho&s;e of ty|ranny, cruelty, inju&s;tice, and every thing hor|rid
<PB N="163" REF="174">
and abominable. We paint the giant ra|vaging the country, plundering the innocent traveller, and afterwards gorging him&s;elf with his half-living fle&s;h: &s;uch are Polyphemus, Cacus, and others, who make &s;uch a figure in romances and heroic poems. The event we attend to with the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction is their defeat and death. I do not remember in all that multitude of deaths with which the Iliad is filled, that the fall of any man remark|able for his great &s;tature and &s;trength touches us with pity; nor does it appear that the au|thor, &s;o well read in human nature, ever intend|ed it &s;hould. It is Simoi&s;ius in the &s;oft bloom of youth, torn from his parents, who trem|ble for a courage &s;o ill &s;uited to his &s;trength; it is another hurried by war from the new em|braces of his bride; young, and fair, and a novice to the field, who melts us by his un|timely fate. Achilles, in &s;pite of the many qualities of beauty which Homer has be&s;tow|ed on his outward form, and the many great virtues with which he has adorned his mind, can never make us love him. It may be ob|&s;erved, that Homer has given the Trojans, who&s;e fate he has de&s;igned to excite our com|pa&s;&s;ion, infinitely more of the amiable &s;ocial virtues than he has di&s;tributed among his Greeks. With regard to the Trojans, the
<PB N="164" REF="175">
pa&s;&s;ion he chu&s;es to rai&s;e is pity; a pa&s;&s;ion founded on love; and the&s;e <HI>le&s;&s;er,</HI> and if I may &s;ay, dome&s;tic virtues, are by far the mo&s;t amia|ble. But he has made the Greeks far their &s;uperiors in the politic and military virtues. The councils of Priam are weak; the arms of Hector comparatively feeble; his courage far below that of Achilles. Yet we love Priam more than Agamemnon, and Hector more than his conqueror Achilles. Admiration is the pa&s;&s;ion which Homer would excite in favour of the Greeks, and he has done it by be&s;towing on them the virtues which have but little to do with love. This &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion is perhaps not wholly be&s;ide our purpo&s;e, where our bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;hew, that objects of great dimen&s;ions are incompatible with beauty, the more incompatible as they are greater; whereas the &s;mall, if ever they fail of beauty, this failure is not to be attributed to their &s;ize.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVI. Of COLOUR.</HEAD>
<P>WITH regard to colour, the di&s;qui&s;ition is almo&s;t infinite; but I conceive the principles laid down in the beginning of this part are &s;ufficient to account for
<PB N="165" REF="176">
the effects of them all, as well as for the agreeable effect of tran&s;parent bodies, whe|ther fluid or &s;olid. Suppo&s;e I look at a bottle of muddy liquor, of a blue or red colour, the blue or red rays cannot pa&s;s clearly to the eye, but are &s;uddenly and unequally &s;topped by the intervention of little opaque bodies, which without preparation change the idea, and change it too into one di&s;agreeable in its own nature, conformable to the principles laid down in &s;ect. 24. But when the ray pa&s;&s;es without &s;uch oppo&s;ition through the gla&s;s or liquor, when the gla&s;s or liquor are quite tran&s;pa|rent, the light is &s;omething &s;oftened in the pa&s;&s;age, which makes it more agreeable even as light; and the liquor reflecting all the rays of its proper colour <HI>evenly,</HI> it has &s;uch an ef|fect on the eye, as &s;mooth opaque bodies have on the eye and touch. So that the plea&s;ure here is compounded of the &s;oftne&s;s of the tran&s;|mitted, and the evenne&s;s of the reflected light. This plea&s;ure may be heightened by the com|mon principles in other things, if the &s;hape of the gla&s;s which holds the tran&s;parent liquor be &s;o judiciou&s;ly varied, as to pre&s;ent the colour gradually and interchangeably weakened and &s;trengthened with all that variety which judg|ment in affairs of this nature &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t. On a review of all that has been &s;aid of the effects,
<PB N="166" REF="177">
as well as the cau&s;es of both; it will appear, that the &s;ublime and beautiful are built on principles very different, and that their affec|tions are as different: the great has terror for its ba&s;is; which, when it is modified, cau&s;es that emotion in the mind, which I have called a&s;toni&s;hment; the beautiful is founded on mere po&s;itive plea&s;ure, and excites in the &s;oul that feeling, which is called love.

<HEAD>SECT. II. The common effect of POETRY, not by rai&s;ing ideas of things.</HEAD>
<P>THE common notion of the power of poetry and eloquence, as well as that of words in ordinary conver&s;ation, is; that they affect the mind by rai&s;ing in it ideas of tho&s;e things for which cu&s;tom has appointed them to &s;tand. To examine the truth of this notion, it may be requi&s;ite to ob&s;erve that words may be divided into three &s;orts; the fir&s;t are &s;uch as repre&s;ent many &s;imple ideas <HI>united by nature</HI> to form &s;ome one determinate compo&s;ition, as man, hor&s;e, tree, ca&s;tle, &amp;c. The&s;e I call
<PB N="169" REF="180">
<HI>aggregate words.</HI> The &s;econd, are they that &s;tand for &s;ome one &s;imple idea of &s;uch compo&s;itions and no more, as red, blue, round, &s;quare, and the like; the&s;e I call <HI>&s;imple ab&s;tract</HI> words. The third, are tho&s;e, which are formed by an union, an <HI>arbitrary</HI> union of both the others, and of various relations concerning them, in greater or le&s;&s;er degrees of complexity, as virtue, honour, per&s;ua&s;ion, magi&s;trate, and the like; the&s;e I call <HI>compounded ab&s;tract</HI> words. Words, I am &s;en&s;ible, are capable of being cla&s;&s;ed into more curious di&s;tinctions; but the&s;e &s;eem to be natural, and enough for our purpo&s;e; and they are di&s;po&s;ed in that order in which they are commonly taught, and in which the mind gets the ideas they are &s;ub&s;ti|tuted for. I &s;hall begin with the third &s;ort of words; compound ab&s;tracts, &s;uch as virtue, honour, per&s;ua&s;ion, docility; of the&s;e I am convinced, that whatever power they may have on the pa&s;&s;ions, they do not derive it from any repre&s;entation rai&s;ed in the mind of the things for which they &s;tand. As compo&s;i|tions, they are not real e&s;&s;ences, and hardly cau&s;e, I think, any real ideas. No body, I be|lieve, immediately on hearing the &s;ounds, virtue, liberty, or honour, conceives any pre|ci&s;e notion of the particular modes of action and thinking, together with the mixt and
<PB N="170" REF="181">
&s;imple ideas, and the &s;everal relations of them for which the&s;e words are &s;ub&s;tituted; nei|ther has he any general idea, compounded of them; for if he had, then &s;ome of tho&s;e particular ones, though indi&s;tinct perhaps, and confu&s;ed, might come &s;oon to be perceived. But this, I take it, is hardly ever the ca&s;e. For put your&s;elf upon analy&s;ing one of the&s;e words, and you mu&s;t reduce it from one &s;et of gene|ral words to another, and then into the &s;imple ab&s;tracts and aggregates, in a much longer &s;eries than may be at fir&s;t imagined, before any real idea emerges to light, and before you come to di&s;cover any thing like the fir&s;t prin|ciples of &s;uch compo&s;itions; and when you have made &s;uch a di&s;covery of the original ideas, the effect of the compo&s;ition is utterly lo&s;t. A train of thinking of this &s;ort, is much too long to be pur&s;ued in the ordinary ways of conver&s;ation, nor is it at all nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould. Such words are in reality but mere &s;ounds; but they are &s;ounds, which being u&s;ed on particular occa&s;ions, wherein we receive &s;ome good, or &s;uffer &s;ome evil, or &s;ee others affected with good or evil, or that we hear applied to other intere&s;ting things or events, and which being applied in &s;uch a variety of ca&s;es that we know readily by habit to what things they belong, they produce in the mind,
<PB N="171" REF="182">
whenever they are afterwards mentioned, effects &s;imilar to tho&s;e of their occa&s;ions. The &s;ounds being often u&s;ed without reference to any particular occa&s;ion, and carrying &s;till their fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, they at la&s;t utterly lo&s;e their connection with the particular occa&s;ions that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ave ri&s;e to them; yet the &s;ound without any annexed notion continues to operate as before.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. General words before IDEAS.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Locke has &s;omewhere ob&s;erved with his u&s;ual &s;agacity, that mo&s;t general words, tho&s;e belonging to virtue and vice, good and evil, e&s;pecially, are taught before the particular modes of action to which they be|long are pre&s;ented to the mind; and with them, the love of the one, and the abhorrence of the other; for the minds of children are &s;o ductile, that a nur&s;e, or any per&s;on about a child, by &s;eeming plea&s;ed or di&s;plea&s;ed with any thing, or even any word, may give the di&s;po&s;ition of the child a &s;imilar turn. When afterwards, the &s;everal occurrences in life come to be applied to the&s;e words; and that which is plea&s;ant often appears under the name of evil; and what is di&s;agreeable to nature is
<PB N="172" REF="183">
called good and virtuous; a &s;trange confu&s;ion of ideas and affections ari&s;es in the minds of many; and an appearance of no &s;mall con|tradiction between their notions and their actions. There are many, who love virtue, and who dete&s;t vice, and this not from hypo|cri&s;y or affectation, who notwith&s;tanding this very frequently act ill and wickedly in par|ticulars without the lea&s;t remor&s;e; becau&s;e the&s;e particular occa&s;ions never came into view, when the pa&s;&s;ions on the &s;ide of virtue were &s;o warmly affected by certain words heated originally by the breath of others; and for this rea&s;on, it is hard to repeat certain &s;ets of words, though owned by them&s;elves unopera|tive, without being in &s;ome degree affected, e&s;pecially if a warm and affecting tone of voice accompanies them, as &s;uppo&s;e,
<Q>Wi&s;e, valiant, generous, good and great.</Q>
The&s;e words, by having no application, ought to be unoperative; but when words com|monly &s;acred to great occa&s;ions are u&s;ed, we are affected by them even without the occa|&s;ions. When words which have been gene|rally &s;o applied are put together without any rational view, or in &s;uch a manner that they do not rightly agree with each other, the &s;tile
<PB N="173" REF="184">
is called bomba&s;t. And it requires in &s;everal ca&s;es much good &s;en&s;e and experience to be guarded again&s;t the force of &s;uch language; becau&s;e the more that propriety is neglected, the greater number of the&s;e affecting words may be taken into the &s;ervice, and the greater variety may be indulged in combining them.</P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IV. The effect of WORDS.</HEAD>
<P>IF words have all their po&s;&s;ible extent of power, three effects ari&s;e in the mind of the hearer. The fir&s;t is, the <HI>&s;ound</HI>; the &s;econd, the <HI>picture,</HI> or repre&s;entation of the thing &s;ignified by the &s;ound; the third is, the <HI>affec|tion</HI> of the &s;oul produced by one or by both of the foregoing. <HI>Compounded ab&s;tract</HI> words, of which we have been &s;peaking, (honour, ju&s;tice, liberty, and the like,) produce the fir&s;t and the la&s;t of the&s;e effects, but not the &s;econd. <HI>Simple ab&s;tracts,</HI> are u&s;ed to &s;ignify &s;ome one &s;imple idea without much adverting to others which may chance to attend it, as blue, green, hot, cold, and the like; the&s;e are capable of affecting all three of the pur|po&s;es of words; as the <HI>aggregate</HI> words, man, ca&s;tle, hor&s;e, &amp;c. are in a yet higher degree.
<PB N="174" REF="185">
But I am of opinion, that the mo&s;t general ef|fect even of the&s;e words, does not ari&s;e from their forming pictures of the &s;everal things they would repre&s;ent in the imagination; be|cau&s;e on a very diligent examination of my own mind, and getting others to con&s;ider theirs, I do not find that once in twenty times any &s;uch picture is formed, and when it is, there is mo&s;t commonly a particular ef|fort of the imagination for that purpo&s;e. But the aggregate words operate as I &s;aid of the compound ab&s;tracts, not by pre&s;enting any image to the mind, but by having from u&s;e the &s;ame effect on being mentioned, that their original has when it is &s;een. Suppo&s;e we were to read a pa&s;&s;age to this effect. "The river Danube ri&s;es in a moi&s;t and mountainous &s;oil in the heart of Germany, where winding too and fro it waters &s;everal principalities, until turning into Au&s;tria and leaving the walls of Vienna it pa&s;&s;es into Hungary; there with a va&s;t flood augmented by the Saave and the Drave it quits Chri&s;ten|dom, and rolling through the barbarous coun|tries which border on Tartary, it enters by many mouths into the Black &s;ea." In this de|&s;cription many things are mentioned, as moun|tains, rivers, cities, the &s;ea, &amp;c. But let any body examine him&s;elf, and &s;ee whether he
<PB N="175" REF="186">
has had impre&s;&s;ed on his imagination any pictures of a river, mountain, watery &s;oil, Germany, &amp;c. Indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible, in the rapidity and quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of words in con|ver&s;ation, to have ideas both of the &s;ound of the word, and of the thing repre&s;ented; be|&s;ides, &s;ome words expre&s;&s;ing real e&s;&s;ences, are &s;o mixed with others of a general and nomi|nal import, that it is impracticable to jump from &s;en&s;e to thought, from particulars to ge|nerals, from things to words, in &s;uch a man|ner as to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of life; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. Examples that WORDS may affect with|out rai&s;ing IMAGES.</HEAD>
<P>I Find it very hard to per&s;uade &s;everal that their pa&s;&s;ions are affected by words from whence they have no ideas; and yet harder to convince them, that in the ordinary cour&s;e of conver&s;ation we are &s;ufficiently under&s;tood without rai&s;ing any images of the things con|cerning which we &s;peak. It &s;eems to be an odd &s;ubject of di&s;pute with any man, whether he has ideas in his mind or not. Of this at fir&s;t view, every man, in his own forum,
<PB N="176" REF="187" MS="y">
ought to judge without appeal. But &s;trange as it may appear, we are often at a lo&s;s to know what ideas we have of things, or whether we have any ideas at all upon &s;ome &s;ubjects. It even requires &s;ome attention to be thoroughly &s;atisfied on this head. Since I wrote the&s;e papers I found two very &s;triking in&s;tances of the po&s;&s;ibility there is, that a man may hear words without having any idea of the things which they repre&s;ent, and yet afterwards be capable of returning them to others, combined in a new way, and with great propriety, en|ergy and in&s;truction. The fir&s;t in&s;tance, is that of Mr. Blacklock, a poet blind from his birth. Few men ble&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t per|fect &s;ight can de&s;cribe vi&s;ual objects with more &s;pirit and ju&s;tne&s;s than this blind man; which cannot po&s;&s;ibly be owing to his having a clearer conception of the things he de&s;cribes than is common to other per&s;ons. Mr. Spence, in an elegant preface which he has written to the works of this poet, rea&s;ons very ingeniou&s;ly, and I imagine for the mo&s;t part very rightly upon the cau&s;e of this extraordinary phenomenon; but I cannot altogether agree with him, that &s;ome improprieties in language and thought which occur in the&s;e poems have ari&s;en from the blind poet's imperect conception of vi&s;ual ob|jects, &s;ince &s;uch improprieties, and much
<PB N="177" REF="188">
greater, may be found in writers even of an higher cla&s;s than Mr. Blacklock, and who, notwith&s;tanding, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the faculty of &s;eeing in its full perfection. Here is a poet doubtle&s;s as much affected by his own de&s;criptions as any that reads them can be; and yet he is af|fected with this &s;trong enthu&s;ia&s;m by things of which he neither has, nor can po&s;&s;ibly have any idea further than that of a bare &s;ound; and why may not tho&s;e who read his works be affected in the &s;ame manner that he was, with as little of any real ideas of the things de&s;cribed? The &s;econd in&s;tance is of Mr. Saunder&s;on, profe&s;&s;or of mathematics in the univer&s;ity of Cambridge. This learned man had acquired great knowledge in natural phi|lo&s;ophy, in a&s;tronomy, and whatever &s;ciences depend upon mathematical &s;kill. What was the mo&s;t extraordinary, and the mo&s;t to my purpo&s;e, he gave excellent lectures upon light and colours; and this man taught others the the|ory of tho&s;e ideas which they had, and which he him&s;elf undoubtedly had not. But the truth is, that the words red, blue, green, an&s;wered to him as well as the ideas of the colours them|&s;elves; for the ideas of greater or le&s;&s;er degrees of refrangibility being applied to the&s;e words, and the blind man being in&s;tructed in what other re&s;pects they were found to agree or to
<PB N="178" REF="189">
di&s;agree, it was as ea&s;y for him to rea&s;on upon the words as if he had been fully ma&s;ter of the ideas. Indeed it mu&s;t be owned he could make no new di&s;coveries in the way of experiment. He did nothing but what we do every day in common di&s;cour&s;e. When I wrote this la&s;t &s;entence, and u&s;ed the words <HI>every day and common di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> I had no images in my mind of any &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time; nor of men in conference with each other; nor do I ima|gine that the reader will have any &s;uch ideas on reading it. Neither when I &s;poke of red, blue, and green, as well as of refrangibility; had I the&s;e &s;everal colours, or the rays of light pa&s;&s;ing into a different medium, and there di|verted from their cour&s;e, painted before me in the way of images. I know very well that the mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a faculty of rai&s;ing &s;uch ima|ges at plea&s;ure; but then an act of the will is nece&s;&s;ary to this; and in ordinary conver&s;ation or reading it is very rarely that any image at all is excited in the mind. If I &s;ay, "I &s;hall go to Italy next &s;ummer," I am well under&s;tood. Yet I believe no body has by this painted in his imagination the exact figure of the &s;peaker pa&s;&s;ing by land or by water, or both; &s;ome|times on hor&s;eback, &s;ometimes in a carriage; with all the particulars of the journey. Still le&s;s has he any idea of Italy, the country to
<PB N="179" REF="190">
which I propo&s;ed to go; or of the greenne&s;s of the fields, the ripening of the fruits, and the warmth of the air, with the change to this from a different &s;ea&s;on, which are the ideas for which the word <HI>&s;ummer</HI> is &s;ub&s;tituted; but lea&s;t of all has he any image from the word <HI>next</HI>; for this word &s;tands for the idea of many &s;ummers, with the exclu&s;ion of all but one: and &s;urely the man who &s;ays <HI>next &s;um|mer,</HI> has no images of &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and &s;uch an exclu&s;ion.

<HEAD>SECT. VI. POETRY not &s;trictly an imitative art.</HEAD>
<P>HENCE we may ob&s;erve that poetry, taken in it's mo&s;t general &s;en&s;e, cannot with &s;trict propriety be called an art of imita|tion. It is indeed an imitation &s;o far as it de|&s;cribes the manners and pa&s;&s;ions of men, which their words can expre&s;s; where <HI>animi mo|tus
<PB N="180" REF="191">
effert interprete lingua.</HI> There it is &s;trictly imitation; and all merely <HI>dramatic</HI> poetry is of this &s;ort. But <HI>de&s;criptive</HI> poetry operates chiefly by <HI>&s;ub&s;titution</HI>; by the means of &s;ounds, which by cu&s;tom have the effect of realities. Nothing is an imitation further than as it re|&s;embles &s;ome other thing; and words un|doubtedly have no &s;ort of re&s;emblance to the ideas for which they &s;tand.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. How WORDS influence the pa&s;&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>NOW, as words affect, not by any ori|ginal power, but by repre&s;entation, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, that their influence over the pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould be but light; yet it is quite otherwi&s;e; for we find by experience that elo|quence and poetry are as capable, nay indeed much more capable of making deep and lively impre&s;&s;ions than any other arts, and even than nature it&s;elf in very many ca&s;es. And this ari&s;es chiefly from the&s;e three cau&s;es. Fir&s;t, that we take an extraordinary part in the pa&s;|&s;ions of others, and that we are ea&s;ily affected and brought into &s;ympathy by any tokens which are &s;hewn of them; and there are no tokens which can expre&s;s all the circum&s;tances
<PB N="181" REF="192">
of mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ions &s;o fully as words; &s;o that if a per&s;on &s;peaks upon any &s;ubject, he can not only convey the &s;ubject to you, but likewi&s;e the manner in which he is him&s;elf affected by it. Certain it is, that the influence of mo&s;t things on our pa&s;&s;ions is not &s;o much from the things them&s;elves, as from our opinions concerning them; and the&s;e again depend very much on the opinions of other men, con|veyable for the mo&s;t part by words only. Se|condly; there are many things of a very af|fecting nature, which can &s;eldom occur in the reality, but the words which repre&s;ent them often do; and thus they have an opportunity of making a deep impre&s;&s;ion and taking root in the mind, whil&s;t the idea of the reality was tran&s;ient; and to &s;ome perhaps never really oc|curred in any &s;hape, to whom it is notwith|&s;tanding very affecting, as war, death, famine, &amp;c. Be&s;ides, many ideas have never been at all pre&s;ented to the &s;en&s;es of any men but by words, as God, angels, devils, heaven and hell, all of which have however a great influence over the pa&s;&s;ions. Thirdly; by words we have it in our power to make &s;uch <HI>combinations</HI> as we cannot po&s;&s;ibly do otherwi&s;e. By this power of com|bining we can, by the addition of well-cho&s;en circum&s;tances, give a new life and force to the &s;imple object. In painting we may repre&s;ent
<PB N="182" REF="193">
any fine figure we plea&s;e; but we never can give it tho&s;e enlivening touches which it may receive from words. To repre&s;ent an angel in a picture, you can only draw a beautiful young man winged; but what painting can furni&s;h out any thing &s;o grand as the addition of one word, "the angel of the <HI>Lord</HI>?" It is true, I have here no clear idea, but the&s;e words affect the mind more than the &s;en&s;ible image did, which is all I contend for. A pic|ture of Priam dragged to the altar's foot, and there murdered, if it were well executed would undoubtedly be very moving; but there are very aggravating circum&s;tances, which it could never repre&s;ent.
<Q><HI>Sanguine foedantem</HI> quos ip&s;e &s;acraverat <HI>ignes.</HI></Q>
As a further in&s;tance, let us con&s;ider tho&s;e lines of Milton, where he de&s;cribes the tra|vels of the fallen angels through their di&s;mal habitation,
<Q><L>&mdash; O'er many a dark and dreary vale</L>
<L>They pa&s;s'd, and many a region dolorous.</L>
<L>O'er many a frozen, many a fiery Alp.</L>
<L>Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens and &s;hades of death.</L>
<L>A univer&s;e of death.</L></Q>
<PB N="183" REF="194">
Here is di&s;played the force of union in
<Q>Rocks, caves, lakes, dens, bogs, fens and &s;hades;</Q>
which yet would lo&s;e the greate&s;t part of their effect, if they were not the
<Q>Rocks, caves, lakes, dens, bogs, fens and &s;hades&mdash; &mdash;of death.</Q>
This idea or affection cau&s;ed by a word, which nothing but a word could annex to the others, rai&s;es a very great degree of the &s;ublime; and it is rai&s;ed yet higher by what follows, a <HI>"univer&s;e of death."</HI> Here are again two ideas not pre&s;entible but by language; and an union of them great and amazing beyond conception. Whoever attentively con&s;iders this pa&s;&s;age of Milton, and indeed all of the be&s;t and mo&s;t affecting de&s;criptions of poetry, will find, that it does not in general produce its end by rai&s;ing the images of things, but by exciting a pa&s;&s;ion &s;imilar to that which real objects excite by other in&s;truments. And in proportion as words of a &s;ublime effect, or words which are u&s;ed to expre&s;s the objects of love and tenderne&s;s, are joined in a manner found by experience the be&s;t for the&s;e pur|po&s;es; in that proportion the mo&s;t perfect
<PB N="184" REF="195" MS="y">
kinds of the &s;ublime and beautiful are formed in poetry. It compa&s;&s;es all its other ends in a manner analogous. It might be expected from the fertility of the &s;ubject, that I &s;hould con&s;ider poetry as it regards the &s;ublime and beautiful more at large; but it mu&s;t be ob|&s;erved that this matter has been handled by many authors before. It was not my de&s;ign to enter into the critici&s;m of the &s;ublime and beautiful in any art, but to attempt to lay down &s;uch principles as may tend to a&s;cer|tain, to di&s;tingu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h, and to form a &s;ort of &s;tandard for them; which purpo&s;es I thought might be be&s;t effected by an enquiry into the properties of &s;uch things in nature as rai&s;e love and a&s;toni&s;hment in us; and in what manner they operated to produce the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions. Words were only &s;o far to be con&s;i|dered, as to &s;hew upon what principle they were capable of being the repre&s;entatives of the&s;e natural things, and by what powers they were able to affect us often as &s;trongly as things in nature do, and &s;ometimes much more &s;trongly.</P>
