<P>TO your Cen&s;ures I commit the following Piece, &s;ince you are all the proper Judges of my Tryal.

you in mind that I have march'd under all your Banners in many Winter Colds and Summer Heats, and given Proofs of my <HI>Conduct,</HI> if not of my Courage, and have di&s;ciplin'd &s;ome of your Troops. <HI>Tho' my Enemies have beat me to the Pit</HI> (as <HI>Brutus</HI> &s;aid), yet, thank Heaven! &s;ome few Friends have interpos'd, and prevented my falling in: There is a Con&s;olation in Innocence that is our be&s;t Shield.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A PREFACE</HI> is Part of the Habit to a <HI>Book,</HI> and no Author can appear full|dre&s;s'd without it: 'Tis a <HI>Cockade</HI> to an Of|ficer, a <HI>No&s;egay</HI> to a Lawyer, a <HI>Patch</HI> or a <HI>Fan</HI> to a fine Lady, or, a <HI>Ribband</HI> to her Lap-Dog.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould tell my Readers, I am prevailed upon with great Intreaties from my Friends to publi&s;h this Piece, I &s;hould embark with a Fal&s;|hood (for it is my own Free-will, Act and Deed); and I would willingly have my Readers believe I publi&s;h nought but Truth. My Cargo is genu|ine, and I have taken up but little on Credit.</P>
<P>If the good Reader &s;hould find better Scraps of Rhyme than my own (which I pre&s;ume will not be over-difficult), I have given them di|&s;tingui&s;hing Marks, that there may be no Doubts on that Account.</P>
<P>The numerous Notes I have &s;queezed in, are meant to divert; if I lo&s;e my Aim, I &s;hall con|tent my&s;elf with con&s;idering, I may be but one among ten thou&s;and that have been mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>I have unnumbered Thanks to many in this Kingdom, and in particular to a young Gentleman who&s;e Good-nature has been indefatigable in my Intere&s;t. The other a Gentleman eminent in the
<PB REF="6">
Law, who has made my Cau&s;e his own. It gives me great Concern I am not permitted pub|licly to own their unbounded Goodne&s;s and Genero&s;ity, &s;ince &s;uch <HI>Sterling</HI> Friends are but &s;eldom met with by Wretches in Misfortune.</P>
<P>I am <HI>Unfortunate</HI> I own, but (as <HI>Oroonoko</HI> &s;ays) <HI>not a&s;hamed of being &s;o.</HI> I bear all with Patience and Chearfulne&s;s; which I find has occa&s;ion'd the following Flight of Poetry from a Friend. I know Authors often write to them|&s;elves; yet I'll a&s;&s;ure you, on my Veracity, it is not the Ca&s;e here; tho' I mu&s;t allow a little Vanity in my Compo&s;ition makes me willing to in&s;ert it.</P>

<HEAD>A General HISTORY OF THE STAGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE STAGE is almo&s;t as old as the &s;acred In&s;piration of the Mu&s;e; ad|mir'd, when at <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> and even in its Infant Prattle, plea&s;ing: Born in <HI>Greece,</HI> and nouri&s;h'd at <HI>Athens.</HI> A merry Author &s;ays, in a Prologue,
<Q><L><HI>The&s;pis,</HI> the fir&s;t Profe&s;&s;or of our Art,</L>
<L>At Country Wakes &s;ung Ballads in a Cart.</L></Q>
And tho' <HI>Bacchus</HI> is allowed to be the Father, yet all Nations, <HI>antient</HI> and <HI>modern,</HI> e&s;teem'd it to be a <HI>&s;ober</HI> and <HI>in&s;tructive</HI> Entertainment.</P>
<P>The early Stages were, indeed, no more than native Turf, or Sod; and what was fir&s;t exhibited, of a Piece, &s;imple Pa&s;toral Songs, &s;ometimes mix'd with Scandal or Abu&s;e, and, may be, home Truths; like the <HI>Terrae Filius</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> or the blazoning <HI>Peccadillos</HI> of two
<PB N="2" REF="9">
opponent Members &s;etting up for the &s;ame Borough. Yet, from the&s;e Seeds of Satire, we owe a <HI>Juvenal, Per&s;eus, Horace,</HI> and <HI>Petro|nius,</HI> and, indeed, the whole Race of <HI>Heroic, Epic, Dramatic,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;toral</HI> Poets and Po|etry; your <HI>Spondees</HI> and <HI>Dactyls,</HI> the <HI>Bu&s;kin</HI> and <HI>Sock,</HI> the <HI>Laurel</HI> and <HI>Bays.</HI></P>
<P>From the&s;e Turf Stages, the Players, &s;uch as they were, mounted a Cart, or &s;ome &s;uch Vehicle, and began to travel Bag and Baggage, perhaps like the Picture of the Itinerants in <HI>Scarron</HI>'s comical Romance. Hear what <HI>Ho|race</HI> &s;ays, in <HI>Latin:</HI></P>
<Q><L>Ignotum Tragicae genus inveni&s;&s;e Camoenae</L>

<P>The fir&s;t Theatre in <HI>Athens</HI> was built, by the Directions of <HI>Ae&s;chylus,</HI> at the public Charge. It was a wooden Pile, yet very &s;pacious. But at the Repre&s;entation of one of the Tragedies compos'd by <HI>Ae&s;chylus,</HI> according to <HI>Suidas,</HI> the Building gave way, by the mon&s;trous Weight of 20000 Spectators, and many were kill'd and maim'd. To prevent &s;uch fatal Ac|cidents for the future, the City order'd one more magnificent to be erected, intirely built with Stone, capable of holding half the Inhabitants without the former Danger: Some Authors &s;ay of Marble, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing, in Elegance, the Temples of their Gods. It con&s;i&s;ted of two Parts, the <HI>Scena,</HI> and <HI>Cavea:</HI> The <HI>Scena,</HI> that Part which form'd the Stage, and other Conveniencies be|longing to it; the upper Part for their <HI>Scenes</HI> and <HI>Machinery,</HI> which were generally flat Cur|tains, with all the Variety of Painting, let oc|ca&s;ionally down to vary the Pro&s;pect, and ma|nage
<PB N="4" REF="11">
the Machinery; as <HI>Lee</HI> intimates, in the Tragedy of <HI>Oedipus:</HI>
<Q><L>O! that, as oft I have at <HI>Athens</HI> &s;een</L>
<L>The Stage <HI>ari&s;e,</HI> and the big Clouds <HI>de&s;cend.</HI></L></Q>
The <HI>Cavea</HI> was the Place where the Spectators were &s;eated: The under Part of the Stage was form'd for rai&s;ing any thing particular for the different Performances, where were al&s;o placed the brazen Tubes for Thunder, and Uten&s;ils for Lightning, and many other Con|veniencies, according to <HI>Graevius:</HI>
<Q><L>With brazen Thunder, forked Lightning hurl'd,</L>
<L>That blazing &s;tream'd, to fright the mimic World.</L></Q>
They had al&s;o different Thunder, for good or bad Omens, according to <HI>Athenaeus:</HI>
<Q><L>Au&s;picious Omen rends the Womb of Night,</L>
<L>And forked Lightning fla&s;hes from the Right.</L></Q>
And again,
<Q><L>Ill-Omen'd Lightning has the Welkin cleft,</L>
<L>And rolling Thunder bellows from the Left.</L></Q></P>
<P>It may well be a&s;k'd by Numbers, If the&s;e <HI>Theatres</HI> were &s;o large and &s;pacious, what &s;ort of <HI>Theatrical</HI> Performers mu&s;t tho&s;e di&s;tant Ages produce? They mu&s;t either have <HI>Stentro|phon</HI> Voices, or their Auditors mo&s;t delicate auricular Faculties. No; in my Opinion the
<PB N="5" REF="12">
Sen&s;es of Hearing and Seeing were much the &s;ame as now: But as to the Voice, that, indeed, doubtle&s;s, wanted A&s;&s;i&s;tance; which to help, they had Coverings to the whole Head and Face, and over the Face a <HI>Ma&s;k,</HI> with a Mouth only, to &s;trengthen the Sound of the Voice; in my poor Opinion, wretched A&s;&s;i&s;tance! Where were the <HI>Eyes</HI> and Mu&s;cles of the Countenance, to command, implore, exult, upbraid, con&s;ent, refu&s;e, and all tho&s;e different Pa&s;&s;ions that agitate the Mind, wherein the Eyes are the <HI>Index?</HI> The&s;e <HI>Ma&s;ks</HI> were made to cover the Head, as was &s;aid before, adorn'd with Hair proper to the Character the Actor was to repre&s;ent upon the Stage. Madam <HI>Da|cier</HI> has given an engrav'd Specimen of &s;everal Ma&s;ks us'd on the <HI>Roman Theatre,</HI> in her Tran&s;lation of <HI>Terence,</HI> which &s;he procur'd in an ancient Manu&s;cript of that Author's Works. The <HI>Romans</HI> follow'd the <HI>Greeks</HI> in their <HI>Drama;</HI> &s;o, we may be a&s;&s;ured, the&s;e Helps came from <HI>Athens</HI> to <HI>Rome.</HI> But as the Voice was to be mo|dell'd, &s;o was the Per&s;on; therefore the <HI>Cothur|nus,</HI> or <HI>Bu&s;kin,</HI> was invented, not like our mo|dern <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Bu&s;kin, but an Elevation of Per&s;on, half a Yard, or &s;o, to emulate the Size of Immortals, or earthly Giants, and He|roes; like our waggi&s;h Boys, appearing upon Stilts. But the <HI>Cothurnus</HI> was only made u&s;e of in Tragedy to <HI>&s;tep &s;tately;</HI> for if they had hurry'd, they might have been in &s;ome Danger of ki&s;&s;ing the Ground: Neither could they, I &s;uppo&s;e, pay Homage to their Monarch, or

their Mi&s;tre&s;s, tho' perhaps, in tho&s;e Days, Kneeling was neither a Mark of Submi&s;&s;ion, or Adoration, at lea&s;t among the <HI>Greeks.</HI> But thus are their Actors pictur'd out by many Au|thors. <HI>Cornelius Nepos</HI> tells us, mo&s;t of the Per|formers on the <HI>Grecian</HI> Theatres were the chief of the Nobility, Per&s;ons of great Learning and Dignity, <HI>Poets, Orators,</HI> and <HI>Hi&s;torians;</HI> even <HI>Kings</HI> did not di&s;dain to appear on the <HI>Athe|nian</HI> Stage. But, what is mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing, the&s;e mon&s;trous Piles of Buildings were &s;o contriv'd, that two of the&s;e large Theatres could turn, join, and form an <HI>Amphitheatre</HI> for the hunting wild Bea&s;ts, &amp;c.</P>

Mr. <HI>Richard Allen,</HI> another great Actor, founded and endowed a College <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">This College was fir&s;t de&s;igned for the Relief and Support of &s;ix Men, &s;ix Women, with &s;ix Children, Per&s;ons thro' Indigence, Misfortunes, or old Age, be|longing to the Theatres of <HI>London.</HI> But, when the Building was going forward, Mr. <HI>Allen</HI> having left off acting, he recommended a Door-keeper to his quondam Brother Actors; they ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed him that &s;mall Favour, which &s;o enraged him, that he turned his Bounty another Way. Both Parties, perhaps, to blame; but, I believe, few cen&s;ured him <HI>out</HI> of the Theatres at that Time. He afterwards increa&s;ed the Number of Children to twelve, from the Age of five Years, to be taught and maintained till 14 or 15. We may imagine the Founder no very great Friend to Matrimony, &s;ince he left Directions, that the Governor &s;hould continue a Batchelor, and one of his own Name; and to give place to another <HI>Allen,</HI> &s;hould he once change his Condition. The College is a noble Building, with a very hand&s;ome Chapel, the Altar-piece elegantly painted, with a well-ton'd Organ; and it is the Duty of the Organi&s;t to teach the Children to &s;ing the proper Services of the Church. The decent Decorum is admired by all. There is al&s;o an elegant Plea&s;ure-Garden, with a u&s;eful Orchard and Kitchen-Garden, all well-&s;tock'd with the be&s;t Fruits, &amp;c. Fi&s;h-ponds, that yield large Quantities of <HI>Carp, Tench, Perch,</HI> and <HI>Eels.</HI> And, much to the Credit of the Managers of this Charity, the original E&s;tate left by the Founder is more than trebled in Va|lue, and they have Money in their Trea&s;ury ready for another Purcha&s;e. I &s;hall end this Account with what Sir <HI>Richard Baker</HI> writes in his Chronicle of <HI>England</HI> where he clo&s;es the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t: <Q>About this Time (1624.) <HI>Edward Allen,</HI> of <HI>Dulwich</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI> founded a fair Ho&s;pital at <HI>Dulwich,</HI> for &s;ix poor Men, &s;ix poor Women, and twelve poor Chil|dren from the Age of four to &s;ix Years, to be there maintained and taught till the Age of Fourteen or Sixteen, and to have a Schoolma&s;ter, with Diet, and a convenient Stipend. This Man may be an Exam|ple, who, having gotten his Wealth by Stage-play|ing, converted it to this pious U&s;e; not without a kind of Reputation to the Society of Stage-Players.</Q></NOTE>at <HI>Dulwich</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI> at his own private Ex|pence.</P>

We have had great Generals, knowing Ad|mirals, worthy Di&s;coverers of new Worlds, as well as illu&s;trious Poets, in the two la&s;t Ages; and why may not their cotemporary Theatrical Performers be as great in their Way? An Author, who wrote about Forty Years pa&s;t, &s;peaks thus of Mr. <HI>Betterton:</HI> <Q>In the Tragedy of <HI>Hamlet</HI> Prince of <HI>Den|mark,</HI> Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> performed the Part of young <HI>Hamlet.</HI> Sir <HI>William Davenant</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>William Davenant</HI> was, by many, &s;uppo&s;ed the natural Son of <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI> He &s;ucceeded <HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> as Poet-Laureat in 1637. and obtained a Patent for a Company of Comedians from King <HI>Charles,</HI> and was knighted by that Monarch. He was accounted a great Poet, in &s;everal Branches of that Science: His Poem of <HI>Gondibert</HI> is e&s;teemed a noble Poem, which he wrote in <HI>France</HI> during his Exile with King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second. His Works are printed in Folio 1673, which contains 17 Dramatic Pieces, be&s;ides his Poems, with his Head crowned with Laurel. The Features &s;eem to re&s;emble the open Countenance of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> but the want of a No&s;e gives an odd Ca&s;t to the Face. I &s;hall not inquire how he came No&s;ele&s;s, yet give you a &s;tale Je&s;t upon the Occa&s;ion. Sir <HI>William</HI> walking by <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> a Fi&s;hmonger's Boy, in watering his Fi&s;h upon the Stall, be&s;prinkled the <HI>Laureat;</HI> who, &s;nuffling, loudly com|plained of the Abu&s;e. The Ma&s;ter begged the Knight's Pardon, and was for cha&s;ti&s;ing his Servant with &s;ome Expo&s;tulations, as well as a Cudgel. <HI>Zounds, Sir,</HI> cry'd the Boy, <HI>it's very hard I mu&s;t be corrected for my Clean|line&s;s; the Gentleman blew his No&s;e upon my Fi&s;h, and I was wa&s;hing it off, that's all.</HI> The Je&s;t plea&s;ed Sir <HI>Wil|liam</HI> &s;o well, that he gave him a Piece of Money, and went away highly delighted. Since I have given you one old Je&s;t upon the No&s;e of Sir <HI>William,</HI> I'll venture to throw in another. As he was walking along the <HI>Mews,</HI> an importunate Beggar-woman teiz'd him for Charity, with often repeating, <HI>Heaven ble&s;s your Eye-&s;ight! God pre&s;erve your Wor&s;hip's Eye &s;ight&mdash;Why, what's the Mat|ter with my Eye-&s;ight, Woman?</HI> reply'd Sir <HI>William, I find no Defect there.

Sir <HI>William</HI> was the Contriver of painted Scenes in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Theatres, as well as one of the fir&s;t Introducers of &s;inging Operas. There is a Work of this Kind, who&s;e Title runs thus: <Q>The Cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> expre&s;&s;ed by In&s;trumental and Vocal Mu&s;ic, and by Art of Per|&s;pective in Scenes, at the <HI>Cock-Pit</HI> in <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> at three in the Afternoon, 1658.</Q></NOTE>

And <HI>Betterton,</HI> in the Memory of many, was
<PB N="23" REF="30">
e&s;teemed the greate&s;t Actor of his Time. Read what the great <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> writes of him, who may be allowed a Judge of the Drama, as well as the Performers.</P>
<Q><P>Such an Actor as Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> ought to be recorded with the &s;ame Re&s;pect as <HI>Ro|&s;cius</HI> among the <HI>Romans.</HI> The greate&s;t Orator <HI>(Tully)</HI> has thought fit to quote his Judgment, and celebrate his Life. <HI>Ro&s;cius</HI> was the Example to all that would form them&s;elves into proper and winning Beha|viour: His Action was &s;o well adapted to the Sentiments he expre&s;&s;ed, that the Youth of <HI>Rome</HI> thought they wanted only to be virtuous to be as graceful in their Appearance as <HI>Ro&s;cius.</HI> The Imagination took a lovely Impre&s;&s;ion of what was great and good; and they who never thought of &s;etting up for the Art of Imitation, became them&s;elves inimitable Characters. There is no human Invention &s;o aptly calculated for the form|ing a free-born People, as that of a <HI>Theatre. Tully</HI> reports, that the celebrated <HI>Ro&s;cius</HI> u&s;ed frequently to &s;ay, the Perfection of an <HI>Actor</HI> is, only to become what he is doing. I have hardly a Notion, that any Performer of Antiquity could &s;urpa&s;s the Action of Mr. <HI>Betterton,</HI> in any of the Occa&s;ions in which he has appeared on our Stage. The wonderful Agony which he appeared in, when he examined the Circum&s;tance of the Handkerchief in the Part of <HI>Othello;</HI> the Mixture of Love that intrudes upon his
<PB N="24" REF="31">
Mind upon the innocent An&s;wers <HI>De&s;demona</HI> makes; betrayed in his Ge&s;ture &s;uch a Va|riety, and Vici&s;&s;itude of Pa&s;&s;ion, as would admoni&s;h a Man to be afraid of his own Heart, and perfectly convince him, it is to &s;tab it, to admit that wor&s;t of Daggers, <HI>Jealou&s;y.</HI> Whoever reads in his Clo&s;et this admirable Scene will find, that he cannot (except he has as warm an Imagination as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> him&s;elf) find any but dry, in|coherent, and broken Sentences. But a Reader, that has &s;een <HI>Betterton</HI> act it, ob|&s;erves there could not be a Word added; that longer Speeches had been unnatural, nay, impo&s;&s;ible, in <HI>Othello</HI>'s Circum&s;tances. Mr. <HI>Rymer,</HI> the greate&s;t Critic of the Age he lived in, in his Di&s;&s;ertation on Tragedy, &s;peaks thus on Mr. <HI>Hart:</HI></P>
<P>The Eyes of the Audience are prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed and charmed by his Action, before ought of the Poet can approach their Ears; and, to the mo&s;t wretched of Characters, <HI>Hart</HI> gives a Lu&s;tre which dazzles the Sight, that the Deformities of the Poet cannot be perceived.</P></Q>
<P>Now, after the Opinions of two &s;uch emi|nent Judges, why may we not &s;uppo&s;e there were as great Stage Performers in Times pa&s;t, as the pre&s;ent, without le&s;&s;ening the Merit of tho&s;e that &s;urvive? If, in my &s;imple Judg|ment, I allow the pre&s;ent equal to the pa&s;t, I cannot allow that they exceed them, no more, perhaps, than the next Race of <HI>Theatrical</HI> Per|formers
<PB N="25" REF="32">
will excel many that now grace the Stage. Excellency, in this Science, does not always run in the Blood, or, like E&s;tates, fol|low hereditary. They mu&s;t be born <HI>Actors,</HI> as well as <HI>Poets</HI> and <HI>Painters:</HI> Yet there are many Dabblers in all three; but, alas! how few come to Perfection! We very rarely &s;ee Brothers or Si&s;ters, Sons or Daughters. or any of the relative Line (though they &s;ometimes take up the Calling, becau&s;e one of the Race flouri&s;hes in the Theatrical Field) &s;ucceed in their Attempts. A Monarch may give Rib|bands, Titles of Honour, or add to his Peers, but no Power but that immortal Godde&s;s <HI>Na|ture</HI> can form a perfect Actor: Yet &s;ome even of the&s;e forget their In&s;tructre&s;s, and Faults invade them to &s;ully their Perfections. Every Performer on the Stage ought to take Virtue for his Guide. Precepts from the Pulpit will not have all their Efficacy from a <HI>Monitor</HI> without <HI>Morals.</HI> A Di&s;cour&s;e on Sobriety, on a <HI>Sunday,</HI> would lo&s;e &s;omething of its In|tention from an Orator known to ba&s;te the Bottle about all the pa&s;t <HI>Saturday</HI> Evening till the <HI>Noon of Night,</HI> as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;ays. The Blind may hear, the Dumb and Deaf &s;ee, but every Sen&s;e mu&s;t be perfect to in&s;truct, and be in&s;tructed. Performers, of both Sexes, ought to imitate tho&s;e virtuous Characters they re|pre&s;ent upon the Stage; the Dignity of the Theatre, then, might emulate that of <HI>Athens.</HI> 'Tis not the Bu&s;ine&s;s brings Scandal to the Performers, if they will take care to avoid

drawing it upon them&s;elves. I have known the Managers of <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> and many of the re&s;t of the Fraternity, meet Regard, and even Re&s;pect, from Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t Rank, from their proper Behaviour; and I am con|vinced every one, with the like Conduct would meet with the like Treatment from People of Sen&s;e and good Breeding; but the Two-legg'd Brutes of the Creation will be ever incorrigible: A decent Dre&s;s will become their Station; but Pride ought to be as far di|&s;tant from them, as the licen&s;ed In&s;tructors of Divine In&s;titution: For if Theatrical Perform|ers are Servants to the Public (as an eminent Actor publicly declared), they &s;hould never attempt to out-dre&s;s their Ma&s;ters. <HI>Veluti in Speculum (behold as in a Gla&s;s),</HI> the Motto over the Front of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Theatre, will &s;erve both Auditors and Actors; and, I think, carries a more in&s;tructive Meaning than the other, of <HI>Vivitur Ingenio (we live by Wit),</HI> which only relates to the Stage. A bad Painter is &s;eldom copy'd, and Excellence is only worth Imitation; Dre&s;s beyond Station is Pride, and Pride very often brings Self-puni&s;hment. I have known Fidlers and Dancing-ma&s;ters wear lac'd Cloaths, but they &s;eldom improv'd any thing but the Taylor's Bill, and as much laugh'd at as the Baboon I have often &s;een in a lac'd Coat and a Bag-wig in the Parade at <HI>Bartholomew-Fair</HI>&mdash;Yet I have &s;een gold Fringe on &s;ilk Ve&s;ts, with white &s;ilk Stockens, worn by the Dancers on the Ropes at <HI>Sadlers-Wells,</HI>

Moral Virtue, and a decent Behaviour, will gain E&s;teem from People of every Rank, will add Weight to the Characters they repre&s;ent, and even may atone for want of Excellency.</P>
<P>Le&s;&s;ons for the Stage may be convey'd, in one re&s;pect, &s;tronger than from the Pulpit, if the Audience were attentive as they &s;hould be at Church: For a Play well wrote, and well perform'd, where Virtue &s;uffers, or meets its ju&s;t Reward, mu&s;t have &s;trong Force upon the Mind, where the Eye is &s;uppos'd to view the very Per&s;ons in the real Circum&s;tances of Hi&s;to|ry. What then will add to this Imagination? Why, the Performers to be as blamele&s;s as hu|man Nature will allow. I remember a virtuous Actre&s;s (or one reputed &s;o) repeating two Lines in King <HI>Lear,</HI> at her Exit in the Third Act,
<Q><L>Arm'd in my <HI>Virgin Innocence</HI> I'll fly,</L>
<L>My Royal Father to relieve, or die,</L></Q>
receive a Plaudit from the Audience, more as a Reward for her reputable Character, than, perhaps, her Acting claim'd; when a different <HI>Actre&s;s</HI> in the &s;ame Part, more fam'd for her Stage-Performance than the other, at the Words <HI>Virgin Innocence,</HI> has created a Hor&s;e|laugh (no Reflection on the Audience, &s;ince a Theatrical Term), and the Scene of generous Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion at the Clo&s;e turn'd to Ri|dicule. Here the Audience are di&s;concerted, and the Reality of the Subject before them lo&s;es much of its Force, with the Imagination
<PB N="29" REF="36">
debilitated, if not turn'd another Way. On the other hand, indeed, if a Per&s;on who acts <HI>Iago,</HI> be &s;u&s;pected to wear a Heart that way inclin'd, he appears &s;tronger in <HI>that</HI> Character, and meets with an Applau&s;e that condemns him. We may find, by the&s;e Examples, Vir|tue is of &s;ome U&s;e upon the Stage, and would be more &s;o, if more practis'd. To give In|&s;tructions to an Actor, is a very difficult Ta&s;k; for if much is wanting, it is not worth while to give any. A rough Diamond may be poli&s;h'd, but few Pebbles are worth cutting. After ma|ny Requi&s;ites for the Stage, bad Action will even cau&s;e a good Figure to appear aukward; and tho' there may be Rules for Action, yet Nature is the be&s;t Teacher; and if an Actor of good Under&s;tanding is truly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with his Character, the true Action will involunta|rily occur. I remember Mrs. <HI>Porter,</HI> to whom Nature had been niggard in Voice and Face, &s;o great in many Parts, as Lady <HI>Macbeth, Alicia</HI> in <HI>Jane Shore, Hermione</HI> in the <HI>Di&s;tre&s;t Mother,</HI> and many Parts of the Kind, that her ju&s;t Action, Eloquence of Look and Ge&s;ture, mov'd A&s;toni&s;hment! and yet I have heard her declare, &s;he left the Action to the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the Sentiments in the Part &s;he per|form'd. I have known &s;ome tolerable Actors, as to Countenance and Elocution, that have mortify'd both by the Badne&s;s of Action, more e&s;pecially the proper U&s;e of their Hands: Had they worn each in a Scarf, they had been much more tolerable, as it is the mo&s;t expre&s;|&s;ive

Part in the Action of the Body, &s;o as <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> &s;ays, <HI>like an ill-&s;heath'd Knife, it will mo&s;t hurt its Ma&s;ter.</HI> I think <HI>Quintilian</HI> &s;ays, all the Parts of the Body a&s;&s;i&s;t the Speaker; but the Hands &s;peak without a Tongue, &s;upplicate, threaten, call, di&s;mi&s;s, provoke, &s;hew every Pa&s;&s;ion of the Soul. The Hands are the ge|neral Language of Mankind, and we need no Grammar but Nature to under&s;tand it. So by their aukward U&s;e upon the Stage, we may turn the Serious into Ridicule. Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> would often regret the want of Opportunity for an Actor to continue in a graceful Attitude, which <HI>Nicolini</HI> the <HI>Italian</HI> Singer was &s;o ma|&s;terly familiar with, between the <HI>Retornels</HI> of a Song, and other Occa&s;ions: Yet when Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> had the lea&s;t Opportunity, he &s;hew'd he only wanted it. I remember in the 5th Act of <HI>Othello,</HI> while he is li&s;tening to <HI>Emilia</HI>'s &s;peak|ing to <HI>De&s;demona,</HI> after &s;he is &s;uppos'd to be &s;trangled, he &s;uited his Attitude and Coun|tenance to the Circum&s;tances of the Scene, that I have not Art to de&s;cribe, but the treble re|peated Applau&s;es of the Audience, while he was &s;ilent, &s;poke &s;uch high Approbation, that Mi&s;s <HI>Santlow</HI> (afterwards Mrs. <HI>Booth)</HI> us'd to &s;ay, <HI>She thought the Audience were pleas'd poor</HI> De&s;demona <HI>was &s;trangled out of the Way</HI></P>
<P>Of all the various Pa&s;&s;ions of Grief, a manly Sorrow is the mo&s;t difficult to expre&s;s. And of all the Actors I have ever yet &s;een, I mu&s;t be pardon'd if I give the Preference to

Mr. <HI>Wilks.</HI> No Heart, that was capable of being touch'd, but mu&s;t have &s;ympathiz'd at his Manner of &s;peaking one Line in the <HI>Orphan</HI> to <HI>Monimia,</HI> in the Fifth Act.</P>

<P><HI>Clau&s;e,</HI> I pray thee leave me; for, by my Troth, I have nothing now to give thee.</P>

The Voice, like an In&s;trument of Mu&s;ic, mu&s;t be put in Tune, and, if managed by a &s;kilful Actor, who&s;e Mind feels the Pa&s;&s;ions, will &s;end out the proper Tone, when a Bungler in Mu&s;ic does but har&s;hly grate upon the Ear. But who is ignorant of this? If this is the Di&s;ea&s;e of the Stage, where is the Remedy? It mu&s;t cer|tainly be in the Hands of the Manager, tho' no very ea&s;y Ta&s;k. The Circum&s;tances of a
<PB N="34" REF="41">
Theatre very often oblige the Directors to thru&s;t Per&s;ons into Characters too weak to &s;up|port the Weight of them: Vanity is blended in mo&s;t human Compo&s;itions, and the Stage is &s;eldom free from it; therefore, when an Actor is once in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Part (Male or Female), they think it a very great Hard&s;hip to give it up to a better Performer. There are a much larger Number of common Soldiers in an Army than commanding Officers, and we have &s;ome few In&s;tances of a Soldier ri&s;ing to Preferment by Merit, whil&s;t others grow grey with a Mu&s;|quet upon their Shoulders; and yet, at &s;ome Time or other, a Soldier may do the Duty of a Corporal, if he is indi&s;po&s;ed, or out of the Way: But that Exigence does not give him a Title to the Po&s;t. I remember an Actor was taken into the Theatre in <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> for playing the Part of <HI>Cae&s;ar Borgia</HI> in a private Play; and when Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> was &s;tudying the Part, he thought it the greate&s;t Oppre&s;&s;ion (as he call'd it) that could be thrown upon him: Nay, after Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> had perform'd the Part, with univer&s;al Applau&s;e, &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Nights, this Per&s;on &s;aid, nay, bound it with an Oath, that <HI>Booth did not know how to &s;peak a &s;ingle Line:</HI> Yet this Per&s;on was a Man of Sen&s;e and Learning. But there are more Requi&s;ites to make a fi|ni&s;h'd Actor: Therefore, as they do not al|ways judge candidly for them&s;elves, it is requi|&s;ite they &s;hould have one of unbya&s;s'd and &s;u|perior Knowledge to judge for them. When &s;uch Actors above-mention'd take Parts, as they

We are apt, even in &s;trange Company, to out with &s;ome Theatrical Quotation, that &s;el|dom fails of declaring what Bu&s;ine&s;s we follow.

I know an eminent Actor, in|vited to dine in a mix'd Company of both Sexes, of Condition: When the Dinner &s;eem'd a little tedious, before it made its Entrance, a Gentleman, one of the Invited, &s;tarts up, and cry'd, <HI>Zounds, Mr.&mdash;, give us the</HI> Gho&s;t <HI>in</HI> Hamlet, <HI>by way of Grace</HI>! The Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e reply'd, there was no Meat he could give him was worth one Speech; be&s;ides, <HI>he did not invite Mr.&mdash;to pay for his Dinner that Way. It was only in Retaliation for the Supper he gave him the Night before, on the Stage, where no Cook but him&s;elf could dre&s;s &s;uch a Di&s;h of black Broth</HI> (meaning <HI>Othello). So, by your Rule of Courte&s;y, if I had invited</HI> Fau&s;an, <HI>I &s;hould have de&s;ired him to dance the</HI> Buffoon <HI>before Dinner.</HI> This was the Height of Civility to one, and a &s;ufficient Rebuke to the other. The Fop (for he was no le&s;s), to plead his Excu&s;e, told the Company, he had been many Times with &s;everal Actors, who took as much Plea|&s;ure to &s;peak Speeches, as he to hear them; and he did not doubt but they were People of great Judgment; for they generally own'd, other Performers did not act &s;o well as them|&s;elves. <HI>Yes,</HI> reply'd the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, <HI>Self-prai&s;e is always to be believed; yet I have known a Sign-painter criticize upon</HI> Raphael.

The Gentlemen of the I&s;land, for &s;ome Time, took their Turns upon the Stage, to keep up the Diver&s;ion; but this did not hold long; for, in two Months more, there were but one old Man, a Boy, and a Woman of the Company, left: The re&s;t died, either with the Country-Di&s;temper <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">The Country Di&s;tempers are, the Dry-gripes, and <HI>Tene&s;mus,</HI> which generally ends in a Sanguinary Flux: Mo&s;t New-comers, for want of a proper Regimen, fall into it.

<P><HI>King Henry the Eighth,</HI> with the Coronation, in the utmo&s;t Magnificence, was performed in the Year of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne, at the Theatre Royal in <HI>Drury|lane, London:</HI> The Succe&s;s <HI>there</HI> was beyond the Bounds of Expectation; it was even added to every Play, as a <HI>Pantomime,</HI> &amp;c. and exhi|bited, that one Sea&s;on, 75 Times.</P>

<P>THIS Per&s;on was bred an Attorney in <HI>England;</HI> but, having a Smattering of Wit and Humour, he left the Study of the Law for Parts on the Stage. He &s;train'd &s;orth a Comedy which was acted on the Theatre in
<PB N="88" REF="95">
<HI>Smock-alley,</HI> call'd <HI>Love in a Hurry,</HI> but with no Succe&s;s. He play'd in all the Theatres in <HI>London,</HI> but never continued long in any; his Way of living was peculiar to him&s;elf and Fa|mily, re&s;orting to the principal Cities and Towns in <HI>England</HI> with his <HI>Medley,</HI> as he call'd it, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome capital Scenes o Humour out of the mo&s;t celebrated Plays. His Company were generally compos'd of his own Family, him&s;elf, his Wife and Son; between every Scene, a Song or Dialogue of his own Compo|&s;ition, fill'd up the Chinks of the &s;lender Meal. He pretended a Right to every Town he enter|ed; and if a Company came to any Place where he exhibited his Compo&s;itions, he would u&s;e all his Art to evacuate the Place of the&s;e Interlo|pers, as he called them. He was never out of his Way; or if he met with a &s;ightly Hou&s;e when he was Itinerant, he would &s;oon find the Name, Title, and Circum&s;tances of the Fami|ly, curry them over with his humorous Ver&s;e, and by that means get &s;omething to bear his Charges to his next Station. His <HI>Finances,</HI> like tho&s;e of Kingdoms, were &s;ometimes at the Tide of <HI>Flood,</HI> and as often at low <HI>Ebb.</HI> In one, where his Stream had left the Chanel dry, yet ready to launch out on a trading Voyage with|out a Cargo, or Provi&s;ion, he called up his Landlord, to whom there was &s;omething due, told him of his Lo&s;&s;es in his pre&s;ent Voyage, and being &s;ent for to another Place, de&s;ired he would lend him a &s;mall Sum upon his <HI>Wardrobe</HI> (which he &s;hew'd him in a large Box) ten times
<PB N="89" REF="96">
the Value of the Debt owing, or the Sum bor|row'd. The hone&s;t Landlord, &s;eeing a proper Security, ea&s;ily comply'd, gave him the Sum demanded, lock'd up the Trunk, put the Key in his Pocket, and retired. But as no Ve&s;&s;el can make a Voyage without Sails, and other proper Materials, he had contriv'd a fal&s;e Bot|tom to this great Box, took out the Stuffing, and by Degrees, &s;ent off his Wardrobe by his Emi&s;&s;aries, unperceiv'd. And that the Weight &s;hould not detect him, he filled up the Void with Cabbage-&s;talks, Bricks and Stones cloath'd in Rags to prevent moving, when the Vehicle was to be taken the next Morning into the Landlord's Cu&s;tody. Every thing &s;ucceeded to his Wi&s;h, and away went <HI>Tony,</HI> but far wide of the Place he mentioned to mine Ho&s;t. A Week was the &s;tated Time of Redemption, which the Landlord &s;aw elap&s;e with infinite Sa|tisfaction (for he had a Bill of Sale of the Con|tents in the Trunk); he open'd it with great Plea&s;ure; but when he &s;aw the fine Lining! he was motionle&s;s, like a Statue carv'd by a bungling Hand. He had recour&s;e to Re|venge. A Bailiff with proper Directions was &s;ent to the Place mentioned; but if he had di&s;cover'd the lea&s;t Wit in his Anger, he might have thought <HI>Tony</HI> knew better than to tell him Truth. I only mention this little Story, to let the Reader know the Shifts the <HI>Itinerant</HI> Gentry are &s;ometimes put to. For <HI>Tony,</HI> when his <HI>Finances</HI> were in Order, and cur'd of the Con&s;ump|tion, hone&s;tly paid him. I have had this Tale

both from <HI>Tony</HI> and the Landlord, who then kept the <HI>Black-Boy</HI> Inn at <HI>Chelmsford</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>Tony</HI> by chance ever came to a Town where a Company of <HI>Showmen</HI> (as People oft call them) had got in before him, he pre&s;ent|ly declar'd War with them; and his general Conditions of Peace were, that they &s;hould act a Play for his Benefit, that he might leave the Siege, and march with his &s;mall Troop to &s;ome other Place. And as he was a Per&s;on of Humour, and a proper A&s;&s;urance, he ge|nerally, like a Cat, &s;kimm'd off the fat Cream, and left the lean Milk to tho&s;e that &s;tay'd behind.

<HEAD>BARTON BOOTH, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS excellent Tragedian was Son to <HI>John Booth,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of the County Palatine of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> a Branch of the <HI>Warrington</HI> Fa|mily. He was born in the Year 1681. in that County; but &s;oon after his Birth his Father and Family removed to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and, at that celebrated School, the Son received his Education, under the Correction (as he call'd it) of the great Dr. <HI>Bu&s;by</HI> and Dr. <HI>Knipe.</HI> He
<PB N="91" REF="98">
inform'd me, the fir&s;t Look he ca&s;t towards the Theatre, was from the Applau&s;e he received in performing in the <HI>Andria</HI> of <HI>Terence</HI> in <HI>La|tin</HI> at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-School,</HI> which perverted his Thoughts from the Pulpit, for which his Fa|ther intended him. At Seventeen he was cho&s;e out for the Univer&s;ity, and had Orders to prepare for his Journey; but his Inclinations prevented the De&s;igns of his Friends.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t apply'd to Mr. <HI>Betterton,</HI> then to Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> Two celebrated Actors; but they decently refus'd him for Fear of the Re&s;ent|ment of his Family: But this did not prevent his pur&s;uing the Point in View; therefore he re&s;olv'd for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and &s;afely arrived in <HI>June</HI> 1698. His fir&s;t Rudiments Mr. <HI>A&s;hbury</HI> taught him, and his fir&s;t Appearance was in the Part of <HI>Oroonoko,</HI> where he acquitted him&s;elf &s;o well to a crouded Audience, that Mr. <HI>A&s;hbury</HI> re|warded him with a Pre&s;ent of Five Guineas, which was the more acceptable as his la&s;t Shil|ling was reduced to Bra&s;s (as he inform'd me). But an odd Accident fell out upon this Occa|&s;ion. It being very warm Weather, in his la&s;t Scene of the Play, as he waited to go on, he inadvertently wiped his Face, that, when he enter'd, he had the Appearance of a Chimney-Sweeper (his own Words). At his Entrance, he was &s;urpris'd at the Variety of Noi&s;es he heard in the Audience (for he knew not what he had done), that a little confounded him, till he received an extraordinary Clap of Applau&s;e, which &s;ettled his Mind. The Play was de&s;ir'd
<PB N="92" REF="99">
for the next Night of Acting, when an Actre&s;s fitted a Crape to his Face, with an Opening proper for the Mouth, and &s;hap'd in Form for the No&s;e; but, in the fir&s;t Scene, one Part of the Crape &s;lip'd off: <HI>And Zounds</HI>! &s;aid he (he was a little apt to &s;wear), <HI>I look'd like a Mag|pie! When I came off, they Lamp-black'd me for the re&s;t of the Night</HI> <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Compo&s;ition for blackening the Face are Ivory|black and Pomatum, which is, with &s;ome Pains, clean'd with fre&s;h Butter.</NOTE>, <HI>that I was flayed before it could be got off again.</HI></P>
<P>He remained here near Two Years, and, in that Time, by Letters, reconciled him&s;elf to his Friends in <HI>England,</HI> and return'd with great Theatrical Improvement, where he gra|dually &s;tept to Perfection. In 1704. he mar|ry'd the Daughter of Sir <HI>Wm. Barkham,</HI> Bart. an antient Family in the County of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> who died without I&s;&s;ue in the Year 1711. <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> in the <HI>Di&s;tre&s;t Mother</HI> plac'd him in the Seat of <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and <HI>Cato</HI> fix'd him there; and, to reward his Merit, he was join'd in the Patent, tho' great Intere&s;t was made again&s;t him by the other <HI>Patentees;</HI> who, to prevent his &s;oliciting his Patrons at Court, then at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> gave out Plays every Night, where Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> had a principal Part. Notwith|&s;tanding this Step, he had a Chariot and Six of a Nobleman's waiting for him at the End of every Play, that whipt him the Twenty Miles in three Hours, and brought him back to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Theatre the next Night.
<PB N="93" REF="100">
He told me, not one Nobleman in the Kingdom had &s;o many Sets of Hor&s;es at Command as he had at that Time, having no le&s;s than Eight; the fir&s;t Set carrying him to <HI>Houn&s;low</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> Ten Miles; and the next Set ready waiting with another Chariot to carry him to <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI></P>
<P>He had a va&s;t Fund of Under&s;tanding as well as Good-nature, and a per&s;ua&s;ive Elocu|tion even in common Di&s;cour&s;e, that would even compel you to believe him again&s;t your Judgment of Things. Notwith&s;tanding his Exuberance of Fancy, he was untainted in his Morals. In his younger Years he admir'd none of the Heathen Deities &s;o much as <HI>Jolly Bac|chus;</HI> to him he was very devout; yet, if he drank ever &s;o deep, it never marr'd his Study, or his Stomach. But, immediately after his Marriage with Mi&s;s <HI>Santlow,</HI> who&s;e wi&s;e Con|duct, Beauty, and winning Behaviour, &s;o wrought upon him, that Home, and her Com|pany, were his chief Happine&s;s, he intirely contemn'd the Folly of Drinking out of Sea&s;on, and from one Extreme fell, I think, into the other too &s;uddenly; for his Appetite for Food had no Abatement. I have often known Mrs. <HI>Booth,</HI> out of extreme Tenderne&s;s to him, order the Table to be remov'd, for fear of over|charging his Stomach.</P>
<P>His profound Learning was extraordinary, &s;ince he left School at Seventeen, took to the Stage at Eighteen, and, by his own Confe&s;&s;ion, that the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Stage, joined with his
<PB N="94" REF="101">
Devotion to <HI>Bacchus,</HI> had taken up mo&s;t of his Time &s;ince, yet I have &s;een him take a Cla&s;&s;ic, and render it in &s;uch elegant <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that no Tran&s;lator would hardly excel. I will &s;et down his Character from a Paper call'd the <HI>Prompter,</HI> by <HI>Aaron Hill,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who&s;e Writings will be a living Monument of his own Merit.</P>
<Q>Mr. <HI>Booth</HI> was a Man of a &s;trong, clear, and lively Imagination. His Conver&s;ation was lively and in&s;tructive: He had the Ad|vantage of a fini&s;h'd Education to improve and illu&s;trate the bountiful Gifts of Nature. Two Advantages di&s;tingui&s;hed him in the &s;tronge&s;t Light, from the re&s;t of the Frater|nity. He had Learning to under&s;tand per|fectly whatever it was his Part to &s;peak, and Judgment to know how far it agreed or di&s;agreed with his Character. Hence aro&s;e a peculiar Grace, which was vi&s;ible to every Spectator, tho' few were at the Pains of ex|amining into the Cau&s;e of their Plea&s;ure. He could &s;often, or &s;lide over, with a kind of elegant Negligence, the Improprieties in a Part he acted; while, on the contrary, he would dwell with Energy upon the Beauties, as if he exerted a latent Spirit, which had been kept back for &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, that he might alarm, waken, and tran&s;port, in tho&s;e Places only, where the Dignity of his own good Sen&s;e could be &s;upported with that of his Author. A little Reflection up|on this remarkable Quality, will teach us to account for that manife&s;t Languor which has
<PB N="95" REF="102">
&s;ometimes been ob&s;erved in his Action; and which was generally, tho', I think, fal&s;ly, imputed to the Indolence of his Temper. For the &s;ame Rea&s;on, tho' in the cu&s;tomary Round of his Bu&s;ine&s;s he would conde&s;cend to &s;ome Parts in Comedy, he &s;eldom ap|pear'd in any of them with much Advantage to his Character. The Pa&s;&s;ions which he found in Comedy, were not &s;trong enough to excite his Fire; and what &s;eem'd Want of Qualification, was only Ab&s;ence of Im|pre&s;&s;ion. He had a Talent of di&s;covering the Pa&s;&s;ions where they lay hid in &s;ome ce|lebrated Parts by the injudicious Practice of other Actors; when he had di&s;cover'd, he &s;oon grew able to expre&s;s them: And his Secret for attaining this great Le&s;&s;on of the Theatre, was an Adaption of his Looks to his Voice, by which artful Imitation of Na|ture, the Variations in the Sound of his Words gave Propriety to every Change in his Countenance: So that it was <HI>Booth</HI>'s Excellence to be heard and &s;een the &s;ame, whether as the pleas'd, the griev'd, the pi|tying, the reproachful, or the angry. His Ge&s;ture, or, as it is commonly call'd, his Action, was but the Re&s;ult and nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of his Dominion over his Voice and Countenance; for having, by a Concur|rence of Two &s;uch Cau&s;es, impre&s;&s;ed his Ima|gination with &s;uch a Stamp and Spirit of Pa&s;&s;ion, his Nerves obey'd the Impul&s;e by a kind of natural Dependency, or relaxed
<PB N="96" REF="103">
or braced &s;ucce&s;&s;ively into all that fine Ex|pre&s;&s;ivene&s;s with which he painted what he &s;poke without Re&s;traint, or Affectation.</Q>
<P>As a Proof of Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>'s Learning, I am de&s;ired to in&s;ert the <HI>Latin</HI> In&s;cription wrote by him on the Death of Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">This Gentleman, Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> was zealou&s;ly at|tach'd to the Intere&s;t of King <HI>James</HI> the Second, and &s;erved in his Army as a Volunteer, with Two Servants. After the Abdication, Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> return'd to the Thea|tre, by the Per&s;ua&s;ion of many Friends, and the De&s;ire of the Town, who admired his Performance. The fir&s;t Character he cho&s;e to appear in was that of <HI>Wilmore</HI> in the <HI>Rover,</HI> his original Part in that Comedy; but, being informed that he &s;hould be maltreated on account of his Principles, he gave Orders for the Curtain to drop, if any Di&s;turbance &s;hould come from the Audience. Ac|cordingly the Play began in the utmo&s;t Tranquillity; but when Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> entered in the Fir&s;t Act, the Storm began with the u&s;ual Noi&s;e upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions (an Up|roar not unknown to all Frequenters of Theatres, and by Time mightily improved by a particular Set that de|light in that agreeable Harmony, as plea&s;ing to the Ear, as a Sow-gelder's Horn, that &s;ets all the Village Curs to imitate the Sound); Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> gave the Signal, the Curtain dropp'd, and the Audience di&s;mi&s;s'd. No Per|&s;ua&s;ions could prevail upon him to appear on the Stage again, till that great Poet, Mr. <HI>Congreve,</HI> had wrote his Comedy of <HI>Love for Love,</HI> which was in the Year 1695. more than three Years void from the above Accident. This celebrated Author prevailed upon &s;everal Per&s;ons of the Fir&s;t Rank to move Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> to appear in the Character of <HI>Scandal</HI> in that excellent Comedy: But he yielded more to the Per&s;ua&s;ions of his &s;incere Friends, Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Barry,</HI> and accepted the Part; and his inimitable Performance added one Grace to the Play. He took his Station in many Plays afterwards, for, I think, three Years. He died of a Cold, occa|&s;ino'd by a violent Fit of the Cramp; for when he was fir&s;t &s;eiz'd, he threw him&s;elf out of Bed, and remained &s;o long before the Cramp left him (in that naked Con|dition), that a Cold fell upon his Lungs, a Fever en&s;u'd, and Death releas'd him in three Days after.</NOTE>the <HI>Actor,</HI>

<P>The fir&s;t Part he perform'd in this Kingdom was <HI>Othello</HI> the <HI>Moor</HI> of <HI>Venice:</HI> To the &s;ur|pri&s;ing Satisfaction of the general Audience, he &s;eem'd a fini&s;h'd Actor dropt from the Clouds.

<PB N="105" REF="112">
<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>Spranger Barry,</HI> from a Friend in the Country.</HEAD>
<P>AS I lately heard you were determin'd for the Stage, my Affection for your Per&s;on, and Concern for your Misfortunes, gave Oc|ca&s;ion to &s;ome Reflections which may, po&s;|&s;ibly, be of U&s;e to you in this new Scene of Life. In the Time of <HI>Athenian</HI> Elegance, when Learning was in Ta&s;te, when Liberty was the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Public, and the Pa|rent of Arts; which Excellence, alone, found Honour, Capacity, Employment, and Me|rit, Rewards; the Stage grew &s;uddenly from its Infancy to Maturity, and, from be|ing encouraged, became it&s;elf the Encou|rager of tho&s;e Talents and Geniu&s;es with which it was &s;upply'd. It was there that each Spectator was taught his particular Conduct, by &s;eeing his own Repre&s;entation in the ge|neral Picture of Life, where the Lights were thrown alone upon Virtue, and the Shades upon Vice; where Great and Eminent, of every Age, were &s;et up for Imitation; where every noble, tender, and exalted Sentiment, was recorded, and daily inculcated; where Purity was invited, Ob&s;cenity exiled; and where the Heart was attached to Virtue, by affectingly walking through all its Scenes of Misfortunes; and, la&s;tly, exulting in its fi|nal Reward. No In&s;titution, le&s;s than divine, could ever be of equal Efficacy, or Advan|tage:
<PB N="106" REF="113">
For when In&s;truction becomes our Entertainment, then, only, it is, that Vice grows dete&s;table, and Virtue delightful, from the Plea&s;ure it brings: And hence were the Sentiments of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Vulgar &s;o exalted, that an immoral Expre&s;&s;ion, tho' naturally introduced in an immoral Character, has been hi&s;s'd off the Stage. Shall we think, then, that where the Doctrine was &s;o glo|rious, the Preaching was di&s;honourable? No, &s;ure. To be an Actor, then, was not to be a <HI>Mimic;</HI> no Trick of Ge&s;ture, or Tone of Voice, could avail: Tho&s;e of Di&s;tinction were to be, by Nature, the very Per&s;ons they re|pre&s;ented; they were to have the &s;ame Ele|vation of Soul, the &s;ame Delicacy of Thought, the &s;ame Morality of Life, the &s;ame Huma|nity of Heart, and Sweetne&s;s of Affections, that could at once con&s;titute the Patriot, the Hero, the Lover, and the Friend. The Words only belonged to the Author, the Sen|timents were, by Nature, their own; and hence flowed that Aptne&s;s of Attitude, that Ea&s;e in Elocution, that expre&s;&s;ive Look, that eloquent Silence, that Freedom of Action, and that Harmony of the Whole, which at once exalted, melted, and &s;ubdued a mighty Nation to Elegance and Virtue. Where &s;uch an Actor was found, he was ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd a Ble&s;&s;ing to the Community. As his Talents were the Admiration, &s;o his Per|&s;on was the Delight, of all People; in his Life he was honoured, and his Po&s;terity provided
<PB N="107" REF="114">
for. You will now, perhaps, be tempted to wi&s;h, that this was the Stage of the <HI>Athe|nians;</HI> but Nature and Mankind are always the &s;ame; and even on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Theatre I have known &s;ome, who gain'd more Encou|ragement and Re&s;pect as Actors, than they de&s;erv'd as Men: But if the Members of your new Province have brought a Scandal on their Profe&s;&s;ion, let it be your Study to re|trieve it. If I have any Judgment, you are qualified to excel in this Way; nor would I have you imagine, that any will &s;hun you in Private, merely becau&s;e you give them Plea|&s;ure and Entertainment in Public. Let your Heart be the true Model of whatever is great, or good, in the Characters you re|pre&s;ent: Take In&s;truction with Plea&s;ure, and Applau&s;e with Humility; and then fear not to be received as the Man of Worth, and the Gentleman you have hitherto been e&s;teemed.

<HEAD>A &s;mall Animadver&s;ion on a late Affair in the Playhou&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>I Went, the other Night, to the Playhou&s;e, in full Expectation of &s;eeing the <HI>Rehear&s;al</HI> perform'd in as high a Manner as was po&s;&s;ible: But, to my great Surprize, the Performance was interrupted, and the Audience di&s;ap|pointed, by a Concert of mo&s;t unmu&s;ical In|&s;truments, in the Gallery. The Cau&s;e of this Noi&s;e and Hurly-burly was &s;oon found to be a private Di&s;pute between &s;omebody in the
<PB N="109" REF="116">
Gallery and <HI>Bardin</HI> the Player, which Di&s;|pute might (with the Con&s;ent of the whole Theatre) have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;even Years, &s;o it had not offended a numerous and polite Audience.</P>
<P>&mdash;If a Player, in his private Capacity, offends me, will this warrant my offending a thou|&s;and People at once? Should I have a Di&s;|pute at Law, or Play with Mr. <HI>G&mdash;ck,</HI> mu&s;t the whole Town, for this Rea&s;on, lo&s;e the En|tertainment of the rare&s;t King <HI>Lear</HI> and <HI>Mac|beth</HI> that ever were &s;een in this, or any other Country? If <HI>B&mdash;n</HI> had done any unwar|rantable and injurious Thing to a Gentleman, <HI>B&mdash;n</HI> &s;hould have made proper and ample Satisfaction, in his private Capacity, for the Offence. The Audience had no Right in, nor Care for <HI>B&mdash;n,</HI> but they certainly have for Prince <HI>Vol&s;cius;</HI> he was their Player; they had paid for him: The Prince had managed his Hor&s;e with wondrous Dexterity, and had an undoubted Right to have ridden him to the Battle. There is nothing more mi&s;taken than that Right which &s;ome People imagine they have in Theatres, and other publick Places; for, in Truth, their Right con&s;i&s;ts only in decently partaking of the Entertainment, and, where they think it de&s;erves it, giving a proper and timely Applau&s;e. It is the &s;ame Right that a Man has in a Ferry-boat, that is (if he behaves him&s;elf properly), to be &s;afe|ly and plea&s;antly landed on the oppo&s;ite Shore; but, if he di&s;turbs the Pa&s;&s;age, and en|dangers the Boat, the Ferryman and Pa&s;&s;en|gers
<PB N="110" REF="117">
will certainly join, and throw him over|board. A &s;urly Swain at a Hor&s;e-race, fan|&s;ying he had a Right to any Part of the Sod, would needs ride directly in the Cour&s;e; the fir&s;t of the Racers threw him and his Hor&s;e twenty Yards on the Ground; and better had it been if he had died with his Hor&s;e on the Spot; for he received a La&s;h from every Whip in the Field. Every Gentleman, pro|perly habited, has a Right to go to Court; but if a Per&s;on, having a Pique to a Battle-ax, &s;hould breed an Uproar in the Levee-room, he would certainly have a Halberd in his Guts, or be &s;ent to the Black Hole. There can be no Excu&s;e for doing an Injury to a Multitude.</P>
<P>I have often dined at a Two-di&s;h Ordinary, where I had a Right to partake of each; but if I &s;hould have taken it into my Head to have thrown one Di&s;h at the Waiter, and kick'd the other about the Floor, I do verily believe I &s;hould have been kick'd down Stairs. If a Gentleman (Heaven defend us!) &s;hould have a Quarrel on his Hands with a Porter, the Gentleman certainly has a Right to do him&s;elf Ju&s;tice; but I &s;hould think it &s;ome|what untimely, if he &s;hould knock the Fel|low down when he had a Dozen of my Wine on his Back. <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> who well under|&s;tood the Decorum of Theatres, gives &s;trong Advice for proper Behaviour: He &s;peaks it to the Players, but he meant it to the Spec|tators likewi&s;e, tho', in his Mode&s;ty, he held

<PB N="133" REF="140">
Plays together: when we were preparing to act <HI>Sophonisba,</HI> or, <HI>Hannibal</HI>'s <HI>Overthrow,</HI> af|ter I had wrote out my Part of <HI>Ma&s;&s;iva,</HI> I car|ried him the Book of the Play to &s;tudy the Part of King <HI>Ma&s;ini&s;&s;a;</HI> I found him fini&s;hing a Velvet Cu&s;hion, and gave him the Book; but alas! before he could &s;ecrete it, his Ma&s;ter (a hot voluble <HI>Frenchman)</HI> came in upon us, and the Book was thru&s;t under the Velvet of the Cu&s;hion. His Ma&s;ter, as u&s;ual, rated him for not working, with a <HI>Mortbleu! why a you not vark,</HI> Tom? and &s;tood over him &s;o long, that I &s;aw, with &s;ome Mortification, the Book irrecoverably &s;titch'd up in the Cu&s;hion, ne|ver to be retriev'd till the Cu&s;hion is worn to Pieces.

His Ma&s;ter ob&s;erving our Looks, turn'd to me, and with Words that broke their Necks over each other for Ha&s;te, abu&s;ed both of us: The mo&s;t intelligible of his great Num|ber of Words, were <HI>Jack Pudenges,</HI> and the like Expre&s;&s;ions of Contempt.</P>
<P>But our Play was gone for ever!

When he came to the Inn, Beds were &s;carce, and he was obliged to take up with that of the Daughter's behind the Bar: The young Woman, going to Bed, found the wearied Traveller in a pro|found Sleep; but, ob&s;erving the Shirt in&s;tead of a Shift, &s;he began to &s;u&s;pect her de&s;ign'd Bed|fellow; and, &s;tooping to look on the Dre&s;s that lay upon the Ground, &s;he &s;aw a Pair of Man's Shoes under the Bed, that convinced her &s;he might have been in an odd Situation, if &s;he had gone to Bed in the Dark.

In the la&s;t Year of the Reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> the Company of <HI>Dublin</HI> went down, in the Sum|mer Sea&s;on, to play at <HI>Corke:</HI> One Evening Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> was invited, by &s;ome Officers of a Regiment then on Duty in that City, to a Ta|vern: Many Healths were propos'd, and went round, without Reluctance; when it came to Mr. <HI>Evans</HI>'s Turn, he propo&s;ed the Health of her Maje&s;ty Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> which &s;o much di&s;|gu&s;ted one of the Company (tho' cloath'd in the Livery of his Royal Mi&s;tre&s;s), that he ran down Stairs, and &s;ent up a Drawer to whi&s;per Mr. <HI>Evans;</HI> who immediately put on his Sword, and went after him, without taking the lea&s;t Notice to the Company. He found his Anta|goni&s;t in a Room in the Pa&s;&s;age of the Tavern, with the Door half open, who courageou&s;ly made a Thru&s;t at Mr. <HI>Evans,</HI> which he put by with his left Hand; at this, Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> drew, thru&s;t the Door wide open, enter'd, and &s;oon drove his Oppo&s;er out to the Pa&s;&s;age, where he di&s;armed the doughty Hero, before the Com|pany above Stairs knew any thing of the Mat|ter. The re&s;t of the military Gentlemen ex|pre&s;&s;ed an Abhorrence to the Treatment Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> received, and, &s;eemingly, reconciled them on the Spot; but, notwith&s;tanding, when the Company return'd to <HI>Dublin,</HI> the Per&s;on who &s;ent the Challenge up Stairs at <HI>Corke,</HI> being then returned al&s;o, told his own Story in &s;uch a Man|ner, that &s;everal warm Gentlemen of the Army were made to believe, that Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> had af|fronted the whole Body Military; and when the
<PB N="145" REF="152">
poor &s;uppos'd Culprit came to his Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Theatre, their Clamour, in the Audience, was &s;o great, that the Hou&s;e was di&s;mi&s;s'd, and no Play to be acted till Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> had a&s;ked public Pardon upon the Stage. His high Spi|rit was, with great Difficulty, brought to &s;ub|mit, but at la&s;t he con&s;ented. I remember the Play was, <HI>The Rival Queens; or, The Death of Alexander the Great;</HI> the Part of <HI>Alexander</HI> to be acted by the Delinquent. He came to a&s;k Pardon before the Curtain: When he addre&s;s'd the Audience, one Smart, from the Pit, cried out, <HI>Kneel, you Ra&s;cal! Evans,</HI> then collected in him&s;elf, replied, in the &s;ame Tone of Voice, <HI>No, you Ra&s;cal! I'll kneel to none but God, and my Queen</HI>! A dangerous Paroxy&s;m, at &s;uch a Cri&s;is. However, as there were many worthy Gentlemen of the Army who knew the whole Affair, the new-rais'd Clamour ceas'd, and the Play went through without any Mole&s;tation, and, by Degrees, Things return'd to their pro|per Chanel. By this we may &s;ee, it is &s;ome Danger for an Actor to be in the right.</P>
<P>Three Years after this Affair, Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> went to the Theatre in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,</HI> and, in his Journey back to <HI>Ireland,</HI> was taken ill of a Fever, at the Town of <HI>Whitchurch</HI> in <HI>Shorp&s;hire;</HI> from whence he was removed, for better Advice, to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> where he ended his Progre&s;s of Life, in the 41&s;t Year of his Age; and was privately buried in the Cathedral, with|out Monument, Stone, or In&s;cription.</P>

<P>SINCE this Gentleman owes his Birth to this Kingdom, and on the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Stage com|menced Actor, I hope it will not be thought improper to give a &s;hort Account of him, which I &s;hall take from his Life, that I col|lected &s;everal Years pa&s;t, to prefix to his Works.

<P>Mr. <HI>George Farquhar</HI> was born, in the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> of Parents that held no mean Rank in that Part of the Country; who, having a nu|merous I&s;&s;ue, could be&s;tow on him no other Fortune than a genteel Education. As tho&s;e who are ble&s;s'd with a poetical Genius always &s;hew &s;ome Glimmerings of their Fancy in their Youth; &s;o he, ere he arriv'd at his tenth Year, gave &s;everal Specimens of a peculiar Turn that Way. One of his juvenile Productions I &s;hall here mention, in which he di&s;covered a Way

of Thinking, as well as an Elegancy of Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, far beyond his Years.</P>

<P>He was educated in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Dublin,</HI> where he acquired a con&s;iderable Reputation: He began very early to apply him&s;elf to the Stage as an <HI>Actor,</HI> following the Examples of <HI>Lee</HI> and <HI>Otway</HI> with our great <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> and with like Succe&s;s; who, tho' all excellent dra|matic Poets, made but indifferent Actors. However, Mr. <HI>Farquhar,</HI> having the Advantage of a very good Per&s;on, tho' with a weak Voice, was never repul&s;ed by the Audience; but the following Accident made him determine to leave off the Occupation: Playing the Part of <HI>Guyomar</HI> in the <HI>Indian Emperor,</HI> who is &s;up|po&s;ed to kill <HI>Va&s;quez,</HI> one of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gene|rals; not remembring to change his Sword for a <HI>Foil</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><HI>Foils</HI> are the Name of tho&s;e Swords us'd in the <HI>The|atre,</HI> with the Edges ground off, and a blunted Point.</NOTE>, in the Mock Engagement, he wounded the Per&s;on that repre&s;ented <HI>Va&s;quez,</HI> tho' (as it
<PB N="150" REF="157">
fell out) not dangerou&s;ly; neverthele&s;s, it put an End to his appearing on the Stage as an Actor.</P>
<P>He was very young when he wrote his fir&s;t Comedy of <HI>Love and a Bottle,</HI> acted at the The|atre Royal in <HI>Drury-lane</HI> 1698. He was pecu|liarly happy in the Choice of his Subjects, which he took Care to adorn with Variety of Characters and Incidents. He la&s;h'd the Vices of the Age, tho' with a merciful Hand. His Plays were wrote in the following Order:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Love and a Bottle, 1698.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Con&s;tant Couple, 1700. This Piece was play'd 53 Nights the fir&s;t Sea&s;on.</ITEM>

His la&s;t Comedy he wrote in &s;ix Weeks, with a &s;ettled Illne&s;s all the Time. He perceived the Approaches of Death before he had fini&s;h'd the la&s;t Act, and (as he had often foretold) died before the Run of the Play was over. It was affirm'd, by &s;ome of his near Acquaintance, his unfortunate Marriage &s;horten'd his Days; for his Wife (by whom he had two Daughters), through the Reputation of a great Fortune, trick'd him into Matrimony. This was chiefly
<PB N="151" REF="158">
the Fault of her Love, which was &s;o violent, that &s;he was re&s;olv'd to u&s;e all Arts to gain him. Tho' &s;ome Hu&s;bands, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, would have proved mere Hu&s;bands; yet he was &s;o much charm'd with her Love and Un|der&s;tanding, that he liv'd very happy with her. Therefore when I &s;ay an unfortunate Marriage, with other Circum&s;tances, conduced to the &s;hortening of his Days; I only mean, that his Fortune, being too &s;lender to &s;upport a Family, led him into a great many Cares and Inconve|niencies: For I have often heard him &s;ay <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s own Words.</NOTE>, <Q>That it was more Pain to him in imagining that his Family might want a needful Sup|port, than the mo&s;t violent Death that could be inflicted on him <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI> was a Per&s;on of infinite Humour, as I have been inform'd, even in his la&s;t Indi&s;po&s;ition.

In one of the&s;e Vi&s;its, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> told Mr. <HI>Farquhar,</HI> that Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> thought he had dealt too freely with the Character of Mrs. <HI>Sullen,</HI> in giving her to <HI>Archer</HI> without a proper Divorce, which was not a Security for her Honour. <HI>To &s;alve that,</HI> re|ply'd the Author, <HI>I'll get a real Divorce&mdash;Marry her my|&s;elf, and give her my Bond &s;he &s;hall be a real Widow in le&s;s than a Fortnight.</HI> While Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI> was in <HI>Tri|nity</HI> College, <HI>Dublin,</HI> he &s;ent to a Gentleman to borrow <HI>Burnet</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Reformation;</HI> but the Gentleman &s;ent him Word he never lent any Book out of his Cham|ber; but, if he would come there, he &s;hould make u&s;e of it as long as he pleas'd.

<P>AS I never had the Fortune to be pre&s;ent at this Gentleman's public Performance, I cannot pretend to be a competent Judge of his Merit; tho', I mu&s;t own, I have heard him launch out into <HI>Mimicry,</HI> which might perhaps give Plea&s;ure to others, but, I mu&s;t own, very little to me.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="160">
I remember an In&s;tance of this kind of <HI>Sa|tire</HI> in my Youth, that gave Satisfaction to &s;ome light Hearts, but greater Di&s;gu&s;t to the more judicious Sort of the Audience.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>George Powell,</HI> a reputable Actor, with many Excellencies, gave out, that he would perform the Part of Sir <HI>John Fal&s;taff</HI> in the Manner of that very excellent <HI>Engli&s;h Ro&s;cius,</HI> Mr. <HI>Betterton.</HI> He certainly hit his Manner, and Tone of Voice; yet, to make the Picture more like, he mimick'd the Infirmities of Di|&s;temper, old Age, and the afflicting Pains of the Gout, which that great Man was often &s;eiz'd with. Certainly <HI>Mimicry</HI> is a Gift from Nature, and laudable, if made u&s;e of like the antient <HI>Mimes,</HI> who could dumbly de&s;cribe every Pa&s;&s;ion of the Mind, and tell a <HI>Tale</HI> with|out a <HI>Tongue:</HI> But to mimic the Infirmities of Nature, may well be term'd Incivility, Barba|rity, and Inhumanity.</P>
<P>I remember <HI>D'Urfey,</HI> the late <HI>Lyric</HI> Poet, &s;tuttered extremely when in a Pa&s;&s;ion, tho' he could &s;peak an Oration, read a Scene in a Play, or &s;ing any of his own Songs or Dialogues, without the lea&s;t He&s;itation. He came one Morning to the Rehear&s;al a little di&s;turbed about a depending Benefit Play, and a&s;k'd, in a Pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>Wh, wh, where wa, wa, was M, M, Mr.</HI> Wi, Wilks? The Drole <HI>Penkethman</HI> an&s;wered, <HI>H, h, he d, d, did n, n, not kn, kn, know.</HI> But the choleric Poet broke his Head for his Joke, and it was with great Difficulty the Bard was appea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="161">
<HI>Mimicry,</HI> as it now &s;tands with us, is like a Statue, larger than the Life, made for a cer|tain Height and Di&s;tance; while upon the Level with you, its coar&s;e Proportion &s;eems mon&s;trous, and overdone. Many excellent Comedians have had this natural Talent. Mr. <HI>Rymer,</HI> that great Critic, tells us, that Mr. <HI>Mountford</HI> was &s;o excellently gifted that Way (if we may call it Excellence), that when he was Train-bearer to the late Chancellor <HI>Jefferies,</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Second, at an Entertainment for the mo&s;t eminent Lawyers, his Ma&s;ter ordered him to come before him, and plead a feigned Cau&s;e, which he perform'd with great Eloquence; and in his Pleadings, to the Admiration of all pre&s;ent, a&s;&s;um'd the Manner and Voice of &s;everal of the be&s;t Pleaders then at the <HI>Bar,</HI> even &s;ome of tho&s;e that were pre|&s;ent at the Entertainment. As I &s;aid before, every thing of this kind mu&s;t be over-done, to make it the more ridiculous; and Actors of great Merit, <HI>thus</HI> mimick'd, are liable to &s;ome little Di&s;grace, which is neither Ju&s;tice nor Good-nature. I have &s;een Faces painted in a Scene of a Multitude, which is generally u&s;ed in <HI>Drury lane</HI> Theatre at the Coronation of <HI>Anna Bullen,</HI> that make mo&s;t ridiculous Fi|gures, &s;o like to be known; and yet the Per|&s;ons they repre&s;ent have nothing particularly faulty in their Countenance or Figures.

<P>THIS complete Actor was born, in <HI>Staf|ford&s;hire,</HI> of an antient Family in that County; had a genteel Education, and was, by his Father, de&s;ign'd for the Law. I doubt not, from his good Sen&s;e and Affability, if he had continued in that honourable Society in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn,</HI> but he might have made a con|&s;iderable Figure at the Bar, and, by his Elo|cution, walk'd in the foremo&s;t Rank of emi|nent Orators.</P>
<P>His Genius led him early to &s;tudy Nature, and leave the crabbed Tracts of the Law. His facetious good Humour gained him Entrance behind the Scenes, two or three Years, in <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> before he commenced Actor; where his excellent Under&s;tanding could pro|fit by the Faults of others, mend them, and improve the Beauties.</P>

His Talent led him to Comedy, of the merry Ca&s;t, in which he gave great Plea&s;ure to the Audience.</P>
<P>His Wit and facetious Humour gained him many Friends, of the be&s;t Sort, and &s;uperior Rank. In the Year 1710. the late Lord <HI>South|well</HI> gave him a Po&s;t in the Revenue, which he enjoyed till Death, which fell out in <HI>January</HI> 24. 1743-4. in his grand Climacteric, two Days before the Night of his Benefit; which was performed for the Widow, his &s;econd Wife, who was Daughter to the Rev.

His Order bore, That he &s;hould retire to his E&s;tate the next Day; and therefore, as the la&s;t Remedy for his Love, he propo&s;ed in|&s;tant Marriage to Mrs. <HI>Oldfield,</HI> which pro|duced no other Effect than a mortifying Re|fu&s;al <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">We may gather, from this Author, that the Pa&s;&s;age mention'd was in the Year 1715. when the Rebel Lords &s;uffer'd Death, and Lord <HI>Nithi&s;dale</HI> made his E&s;cape from the <HI>Tower,</HI> di&s;gui&s;ed by his Lady in her Habit. Sir <HI>Ro|ger Mo&s;tings,</HI> then Commander in the Fourth Troop of Life-guards, &s;poke too freely in Favour of the impri&s;on'd Noblemen that were concern'd in the Rebellion, and therefore was order'd to leave the Court, and retire to his E&s;tate; as al&s;o the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Aile&s;|ford,</HI> the Lords <HI>Finche</HI> and <HI>Guern&s;ey,</HI> my Lord <HI>Portmore,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Orkney,</HI> Lord <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and many others; all depriv'd of their Po&s;ts and Places, with the &s;ame Or|ders to retire to their E&s;tates. Sir <HI>Roger</HI> was e&s;teemed one of the hand&s;ome&s;t Men in the Kingdom, witty, well|bred, and had a great E&s;tate; which proves that Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> de&s;pi&s;ed Intere&s;t, and would not give her Hand without her Heart.</NOTE>.

<P>It is, in &s;ome &s;ort, a Hard&s;hip to a ri&s;ing Genius, in the fir&s;t Entrance to a regular e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Company: The Parts are all &s;upplied, and, like Under-officers in an Army, they mu&s;t wait for Pre&s;erment, or do &s;omething extraor|dinary, before they can expect it. An Acci|dent fell out, that gave our young Actor a happy Opportunity.</P>
<P>The Managers had an Order, from the <HI>Lord Chamberlain,</HI> to revive the Play of <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> for the 4th of <HI>November</HI> 1716. which was got up with the utmo&s;t Magnificence.

The next Night he made him&s;elf perfect, and performed it with redoubled Applau&s;es of Approbation; and was
<PB N="215" REF="222">
complimented by &s;everal Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction, and dramatic Ta&s;te, upon his early ri&s;ing Ge|nius.</P>
<P>But as the Theatrical World is a Picture, in Miniature, of the Great, Envy will &s;hake her &s;naky Locks; People of twice his Age thought his Progre&s;s a little too rapid for their Appro|bation. His Temper took fire at the vi&s;ible Depre&s;&s;ion; he bore it &s;ome Time with Tem|per, but the fir&s;t Opportunity he engag'd with Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,</HI> where, by ju&s;t Degrees, he attained the highe&s;t Round of Perfection; and (not to take any Merit from other Performers) was certainly the chief Pillar that &s;upported all the Theatres where-ever he has performed.

<P>THIS Gentleman was once in <HI>Ireland</HI> with the celebrated Mr. <HI>Quin,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Clive,</HI> in the Year 1741. He was born in <HI>England</HI> in the Year 1694. The fir&s;t Part he was taken Notice of in, was that of <HI>Marcus</HI> in <HI>Cato,</HI> which was fir&s;t acted in 1712.</P>
<P>In the Run of that celebrated Tragedy he was accidentally brought into a Fray with &s;ome of our <HI>Tritons</HI> on the <HI>Thames;</HI> and, in the Scuffle, a Blow on the No&s;e was given him by one of the&s;e Water-bullies, who neither regard Men nor Manners: I remember, the &s;ame Night, as he was brought on the <HI>Bier,</HI> after his &s;uppos'd Death in the Fourth Act of <HI>Cato,</HI> the Blood, from the real Wound in the Face, gu&s;h'd out with Violence; that Hurt had no other Effect than ju&s;t turning his No&s;e a little, tho' not to Deformity; yet &s;ome People ima|gine it gave a very &s;mall Alteration to the Tone of his Voice, tho' nothing di&s;agreeable. He acquitted him&s;elf in many capital Parts, both in Tragedy and Comedy, to the Sati&s;|faction of his Auditors; and has been ever e&s;teemed in the fir&s;t Rank of Actors.</P>
<P>Some few Years ago another unfortunate Accident befel him: As he was going home to his Hou&s;e after his Night's Performance, he was attack'd by a Street robber; and, making Re&s;i&s;tance, the Villain &s;hot a Brace of Pi&s;tol-Bullets
<PB N="217" REF="224">
into his Mouth, which broke &s;ome Part of his Jaw: By the Help of a Lamp the Rob|ber knew Mr. <HI>Ryan,</HI> as I have been inform'd, begg'd his Pardon for his Mi&s;take, and ran off. Of this Hurt, too, he recover'd, after a long Illne&s;s, and play'd with Succe&s;s, as before, with|out any &s;eeming Alteration of Voice or Face. His Royal Highne&s;s, upon this Accident, &s;ent him a hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent; and others, of the Nobility, copy'd the laudable Example of the &s;econd illu&s;trious Per&s;on in the three King|doms.

<P>THE Ance&s;tors of this mo&s;t excellent Co|median, were &s;eated many Ages in an affluent Inheritance at <HI>Brom&s;grove</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Brom&s;grove</HI> is one of the chief trading Towns in the County for the fine&s;t Broad Cloths, containing about 500 well-built Hou&s;es on the Brink of the River <HI>Sal|warp,</HI> 93 mea&s;ur'd Miles from <HI>London.</HI></NOTE>in <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> where mo&s;t of the chief Inhabit|ants bear the Name of <HI>Wilks.</HI></P>
<P>The Grandfather of our excellent Comedian (Judge <HI>Wilks),</HI> in the Civil Wars, rais'd a Troop of Hor&s;e, at his own Expence, for the Service of the unfortunate King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, which was commanded by Col. <HI>Wilks,</HI> Brother to the Judge, and Great Uncle to our Comedian.</P>
<P>In that unnatural War, the Family &s;uffered greatly by Rapine and Per&s;ecution; which was the main Motive that &s;ent <HI>Edward Wilks,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> with his Wife, and the &s;hatter'd Remains of an ample Fortune, to <HI>Dublin,</HI> for the Security of his Per&s;on, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="238">
Our great Comedian was born at <HI>Rathfarn|ham</HI> near <HI>Dublin,</HI> in the Year 1670. His Fa|ther gave him a genteel Education. He wrote an excellent fine ma&s;terly Hand, with &s;uch Celerity that was &s;urpri&s;ing. His Genius re|commended him to Secretary <HI>Southwell,</HI> who confirm'd him one of his Clerks when Eighteen Years of Age.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t Inclination to the <HI>Theatre</HI> proceed|ed from the Prai&s;es of Mr. <HI>Richards,</HI> then an Actor on the <HI>Dublin</HI> Stage. Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> lodg'd near Mr. <HI>Wilks;</HI> and, being intimate with each other, he u&s;ed to hold the Book of the Play, to hear if <HI>Richards</HI> was perfect in the Part he was then &s;tudying. Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> u&s;ed to read the introductive Speeches, with &s;uch proper Empha&s;is, Cadence, and all the various Pa&s;&s;ions, that the Encomiums given by Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> began to fire his Mind for the <HI>Drama.</HI> It was with very little Per&s;ua|&s;ion he ventured to act privately the <HI>Colonel</HI> in the <HI>Spani&s;h Fryar,</HI> at Mr. <HI>A&s;hbury</HI>'s, the en&s;uing <HI>Chri&s;tmas;</HI> where he received &s;uch Approbation from that great Ma&s;ter, as confirm'd his Intention.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Part he played on the Theatre was <HI>Othello,</HI> with the utmo&s;t Applau&s;e; and, as he told me, plea&s;ed all but him&s;elf. He went on with great Succe&s;s, for Two Years, when his Friend Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>A&s;hbury</HI> informed me, that Mr. <HI>Richards</HI> was a very good Actor, both in Tragedy and Comedy, but not over-happy in his per&s;onal Appearance.</NOTE>advi&s;ed him to try his
<PB N="232" REF="239">
Fortune in <HI>England,</HI> and gave him Letters of Recommendation to Mr. <HI>Betterton,</HI> who re|ceiv'd him very kindly, and entered him at Fifteen Shillings a Week.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t Appearance on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage, was in the Part of the young Prince in the <HI>Maid's Tragedy,</HI> a very in&s;ignificant Character, requiring little more than an amiable Figure. Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> performed <HI>Melantius;</HI> but when that veteran Actor came to addre&s;s him on the Battlements, to excu&s;e him&s;elf for the Death of the King in the Play, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> affirmed to me, that the Dignity of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> &s;truck him with &s;uch an Awe, that he had much ado to utter the little he had to &s;ay. Mr. <HI>Bet|terton,</HI> ob&s;erving his Confu&s;ion, &s;aid to him, <HI>Young Man, this Fear does not ill become you; a Hor&s;e that &s;ets out at the Strength of his Speed will &s;oon be jaded.</HI></P>
<P>However, Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> &s;oon &s;hook off his Apprehen&s;ions, and began to ri&s;e in the E&s;teem of the Audience, and better Parts gained him a better Salary.</P>
<P>He often a&s;&s;i&s;ted Mr. <HI>Harris</HI> (an eminent Dancing-ma&s;ter at that time) in teaching his Scholars; and, by his genteel Addre&s;s, gained the Affection of a young Lady, Daughter to <HI>Ferdinand Knapton,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Steward of the New Fore&s;t in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and by Con&s;ent of the Father they were joined in Wedlock. By this Gentlewoman he had one Son and Daughter; the Son died in his Youth; the Daughter was
<PB N="233" REF="240">
married to Captain <HI>Price</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Mrs. <HI>Price</HI> did not &s;urvive her Marriage above a Twelvemonth. She expired childle&s;s in the Year 1712. the 20th Year of her Age.</NOTE>, to whom he made up a Fortune of a thou&s;and Pounds.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s Finances not well an&s;wering the State of an increa&s;ing Family, he pre&s;s'd for an Addition to his Salary, which every Per|&s;on but the <HI>Manager</HI> thought he de&s;erved; but his Reque&s;t was not complied with.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>A&s;hbury</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> hearing of his Di&s;|content, came over on Purpo&s;e to engage him. He agreed with Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> for Sixty Pounds a Year, and a clear Benefit, which in tho&s;e Times was much more than any other Actor ever had. When he went to take his Leave of Mr. <HI>Betterton,</HI> the <HI>Manager</HI> was with him. That great Actor expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome Concern at his leaving the Company. "I fan&s;y (&s;aid Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>) that Gentleman (pointing to the Manager), if he has not too much Ob|&s;tinacy to own it, will be the fir&s;t that re|pents your parting; for, if I fore&s;ee aright, you will be greatly wanted here."</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> told me this Speech gave him infinite Plea&s;ure; and made him re&s;olve to &s;earch into him&s;elf, to find out what Mr. <HI>Bet|terton</HI>'s known Judgment &s;eemed to promi&s;e he might find. Prai&s;e from an Adept in any Science will excite Emulation, and, with &s;ome People, do more than Reward. From this Time Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI> grew more a&s;&s;iduous, and thought every Moment lo&s;t, that was not laid

out upon his Studies, till he arrived at that &s;u|preme Excellence, even now remembered by innumerable Judges of the <HI>Drama.</HI></P>
<P>It was not long before the prophetic Words of Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> were fulfilled.

<P>Mr. <HI>Mountford</HI> was ba&s;ely murder'd by a Thru&s;t thro' the Back, while a fal&s;e Friend held him in his Arms with a treacherous Embrace, in <HI>Norfolk-&s;treet</HI> in the <HI>Strand,</HI> in the Year 1692. He was the Author of the following Plays.</P>

was the Sickne&s;s of all their genteel Comedies, till his Parts could be &s;upplied. Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> therefore, was immediately &s;ent to, with Propo&s;als of Four Pounds a Week; which was a Salary equal to Mr. <HI>Betterton.</HI> This was too advantageous an Offer to be refu&s;ed; therefore he prepared for his Journey privately. Mr. <HI>A&s;hbury</HI> was &s;o unwilling to part with him, that he procured an Order from the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> (then Lord Lieutenant) to prevent his going; but a par|ticular Friend giving him timely Notice there|of, he went &s;ecretly to <HI>Hoath,</HI> where a Boat waited to convey him on board, and he landed &s;afe in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="242">
The fir&s;t Part he performed of <HI>Mountford</HI>'s was <HI>Palamede</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> has, from this Play of <HI>Marriage Ala|mode,</HI> and the Comedy Part of <HI>Secret Love,</HI> or the <HI>Mai|den Queen,</HI> compounded (with &s;ome Ingredients of his own) an excellent Comedy called the <HI>Comical Lovers.</HI></NOTE>in <HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Marriage Alamode,</HI> a Comedy, with &s;uch extraordinary Succe&s;s, as he often &s;aid, it made him almo&s;t mad with Joy.

Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s Excellence in Comedy was never once di&s;puted, but the be&s;t Judges ex|tol him for the different Parts in Tragedy; as <HI>Hamlet, Ca&s;talio</HI> in the <HI>Orphan, Ziphares</HI> in <HI>Mithridates, Edgar</HI> in King <HI>Lear, Norfolk</HI> in the <HI>Albion Queens, Piercy</HI> in <HI>Anna Bullen,</HI> Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Shore, Macduff, Mone&s;es</HI> in <HI>Tamerlane, Jaffeir</HI> in <HI>Venice Pre&s;erv'd;</HI> and a countle&s;s Catalogue of other Parts in Tra|gedy, which he was allowed to perform in their full Perfection.</P>

<P><Q>This Performance <HI>(The Trip to the Ju|bilee)</HI> is the greate&s;t In&s;tance that we can have of the irre&s;i&s;tible Force of proper Action.

<P>In the Preface to the &s;ame Play the Au|thor &s;ays: "Whenever the Stage has the Misfortune to lo&s;e Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> that <HI>Wildair</HI> may go to the <HI>Jubilee.</HI>"</P>
<P>In the Preface to the <HI>Stratagem,</HI> the Author ends thus: <Q>The Reader may find &s;ome Faults in this Play, which my Illne&s;s pre|vented the amending of; but there is great Amends made in the Repre&s;entation, which cannot be matched, no more than

the friendly and indefatigable Care of Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> to whom I chiefly owe the Succe&s;s of the Play.</Q></P>
<P>Here is enough &s;aid to illu&s;trate the per|&s;onal Qualifications of this Gentleman as an Actor; therefore let me attempt to delineate his Mind.</P>
<P>His Pur&s;e was ever open to proper Objects of Charity; and I have often &s;een Tears in his Eyes at the Relation of any Misfortune that befel others. He was ever the fir&s;t Pro|po&s;er in any joint Charity from the Theatrical Stock, and, I am convinced, has often pre|vailed upon their unwilling Liberality. His Care of the Orphan Daughters of Mr. <HI>Far|quhar,</HI> by giving them &s;everal Benefit Plays, continued to the la&s;t of his Days; and, in lo&s;ing him, they have in Reality lo&s;t a Father: But, I hope, his con&s;tant Stream of Bounty has placed them above Want. In &s;hort, his private Acts of Charity are numberle&s;s. I &s;hall add one in particular.</P>
<P>A Gentleman, a Native of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who&s;e Name is <HI>Smith,</HI> who received a liberal Educa|tion in <HI>Trinity-College, Dublin,</HI> brought a Tra|gedy to the Managers of the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> for their Approbation: The Play was read, and returned, with De&s;ire to make &s;ome Alterations for the next Sea&s;on. This po&s;tponing but ill agreed with our Author's Circum&s;tances, that loudly called for a &s;peedy Supply. Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> knowing the ill State of his Finances, bought a Night of his Bro|ther

ther Managers, and gave it to Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> for a Benefit. Yet he did not think that &s;u&s;|ficient, but u&s;ed all his Intere&s;t to make it truly a Benefit, and put a Hundred Guineas clear in the Author's Pocket; with which he took Leave of his Benefactor, and the Mu&s;es; embarked for <HI>Holland,</HI> where he put him&s;elf under the Tuition of the great <HI>Boerhaave</HI> at <HI>Leyden;</HI> and, in time, profited &s;o well, that his great Ma&s;ter of Medicine &s;ent him to <HI>Peter&s;burgh,</HI> at the Reque&s;t of the <HI>Czarina,</HI> where, at his fir&s;t Arrival, a hand&s;ome Pen|&s;ion was &s;ettled upon him.

<P>THIS Per&s;on was born at <HI>Stamford</HI> in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> in the Year 1708. where his Father and Mother, belonging to a Country Company, were then playing. He play'd, as he inform'd me, the Part of the <HI>Duke of York</HI> in <HI>Richard the Third,</HI> before he could &s;peak plain; &s;o that it may be &s;aid, he was born an Actor.

<P>In the Year 1738. he came over into this Kingdom, and may be well remember'd; his Excellence, in &s;everal Parts of Comedy, having not yet been outdone. I cannot avoid men|tioning
<PB N="245" REF="252">
a Pa&s;&s;age in the Life of this truly good Comedian.</P>
<P>While he and his Family belong'd to the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-lane,</HI> after the Com|pany had fini&s;h'd the Sea&s;on of Playing in <HI>London</HI> (which generally is at the End of <HI>May),</HI> he, with his Father and Mother, went, for the Summer-&s;ea&s;on, to play at &s;everal Towns in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> (the Cu&s;tom of many of both e&s;tabli&s;hed Theatres). When the Company were &s;ummon'd to meet in <HI>London</HI> at the u&s;ual Time (the latter End of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI>) to begin the Winter-&s;ea&s;on, I receiv'd the following &s;hort Letter:</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. <HI>Wetherilt,</HI> and his Wife, beg you will excu&s;e them to Mr. <HI>Wilks;</HI> their Son is at the Point of Death. They beg an An&s;wer. Be pleas'd to direct to your humble Servant</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The Meaning why I mention this Letter is, that the Son, the very Night this Letter was wrote, in all Appearance, expir'd, was &s;tripp'd and wa&s;h'd, the Bed taken away, and he laid &s;tretch'd on a Mat, with a Ba&s;on of Salt (a common Cu&s;tom in <HI>England</HI>) placed on his Sto|mach, the incon&s;olable Parents remov'd to an|other Hou&s;e, the Coffin brought to the Son's
<PB N="246" REF="253">
Chamber, and the Windows all open. About Eight at Night a Per&s;on was &s;ent with a Light to watch the Corp&s;e: When &s;he open'd the Door, the fir&s;t Object &s;he perceiv'd was poor <HI>Bob</HI> (as he was generally call'd by his Fami|liars) &s;itting up, with his Teeth trembling in his Head (and well they might) with Cold. The Woman, in her Fright, dropp'd the Candle, and &s;cream'd out, <HI>The Devil! the Devil</HI>! This Fright alarm'd another Woman below, who ran up-&s;tairs to &s;ee what was the Matter: In the mean time <HI>Bob,</HI> with much ado, had made a Shift to get from the Bed; and, tak|ing up the Candle, which lay upon the Floor unextingui&s;h'd, was creeping to the Door to call for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, as naked as from the Womb of his Mother; which the two Women per|ceiving, with joint Voices repeated again, <HI>A Gho&s;t! a Gho&s;t! the Devil! the Devil</HI>! The Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, hearing this Uproar, ran him&s;elf, to know the Rea&s;on; where poor <HI>Bob,</HI> the &s;uppos'd Devil, and he, &s;oon came to a right Under&s;tanding. He was put into a warm Bed, to the un&s;peakable Joy of his de&s;ponding Pa|rents, and in ten Days after in <HI>London (viva voce)</HI> told me the whole Story of his Death.</P>
<P>This Accident, when real Death paid him a Vi&s;it, work'd &s;o &s;trongly upon his forlorn Pa|rents, that they would not let his Corp&s;e be coffin'd till five Days after he expir'd. Vain Hope! He died in 1743. in the 35th Year of his Age. Both his Parents died &s;oon after him. I am &s;orry to end this Account with &s;aying, his

<P>THIS Per&s;on was born in the Year 1700. In his Youth he was a very promi&s;ing Actor.

The Applau&s;e he gain'd from performing the Part of <HI>Macheath</HI> in the <HI>Beggars Opera,</HI> was fatal to him: He follow'd <HI>Bacchus</HI> too ar|dently, in&s;omuch that his Credit was often drown'd upon the Stage, and, by Degrees, al|mo&s;t render'd him u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>He was the &s;uppos'd Author of two dramatic Pieces; <HI>viz. The Quakers Opera,</HI> and a Tra|gedy call'd <HI>The Fate of Villainy.</HI> This Play he brought to <HI>Ireland</HI> in the Year 1744. and prevailed on the Proprietors to act it, under the Title of <HI>Love and Loyalty.</HI> The &s;econd Night was given out for his Benefit; but not being able to pay in Half the Charge of the common Expences, the Doors were order'd to be kept

<P>THIS facetious Per&s;on mu&s;t not be forgot, who&s;e Performance, as an Actor and a Poet, has often diverted the Town.

To give one In&s;tance of it: He and I were together, with|out any other Company; when, on the Back of a Play-bill, he &s;truck out the following Song, for his little Opera call'd <HI>A Cure for a Scold.</HI></P>
<Q><LG>
<L>WHoe'er to a Wife</L>
<L>Is link'd for his Life,</L>
<L>Is plac'd in a wretched Condition;</L>

<L>A Bone of the be&s;t,</L>

<L>He's hara&s;s'd and plagu'd, without Mea&s;ure, Poor Cur,</L>
<L>He's hara&s;s'd, &amp;c.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P>Now what convinces me of the quick Coin|age of this Song is, that the la&s;t Stanza was produced by the Accident of &s;eeing a Dog run, at that In&s;tant, by the Window, with a Bone ty'd to his Tail, follow'd by a hooting Mob.</P>
<P>This may certainly be &s;aid of him, that he had an inexhau&s;tible Fund of Good-humour, Good-nature, and Genero&s;ity; and might have had a heavier Pur&s;e, if he had not been &s;o light of Heart. I &s;hall end with two Lines of his own, with very little Variation.</P>

<P>THIS amiable Actre&s;s was born in <HI>Dublin</HI> of reputable Parents, who gave her a genteel Education.

<P><HI>Lothario,</HI> after he is kill'd by <HI>Altamont</HI> in the 4th Act, lies dead by Proxy in the 5th, rai&s;ed on a Bier covered with Black by the <HI>Property-man,</HI> and the Face whitened by the Barber, the Coat and Perriwig generally filled by one of the Dre&s;&s;ers. Mo&s;t of the capital Actors in the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Theatres have generally a Dre&s;&s;er to them|&s;elves, tho' they are paid by the Manager, to be ready, on all Occa&s;ions, for Stage-guards, Attendance, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Powell</HI> played <HI>Lothario,</HI> and one <HI>Warren,</HI> his Dre&s;&s;er, claimed a Right of lying for his Ma&s;ter, and performing the dead Part of <HI>Lothario,</HI> which he propo&s;ed to act to the be&s;t Advantage; tho' <HI>Powell</HI> was ignorant of the Matter. The Fifth Act began, and went on, as u&s;ual, with Applau&s;e; but, about the Middle of the di&s;|tre&s;sful Scene, <HI>Powell</HI> called aloud for his Man <HI>Warren,</HI> who as loudly replied, from the Bier on the Stage, <HI>Here, Sir! Powell</HI> (who, as I &s;aid before, was ignorant of the Part his Man was doing) repeated, without Lo&s;s of Time, <HI>Come here this Moment, you Son of a Whore! or I'll break all the Bones in your Skin. Warren</HI> knew his ha&s;ty Tem|per; therefore, without any Reply, jump'd off, with all his Sables about him, which, unfortunately, were tied fa&s;t to the Handles of the Bier, and dragg'd after him. But this was not all; the Laugh and Roar began in the Audience, till it frighten'd poor <HI>Warren</HI> &s;o much, that, with the Bier at his Tail, he threw down <HI>Cali&s;ta</HI> (Mrs. <HI>Barry),</HI> and overwhelm'd her with the Table, Lamp, Book, Bones, together with all the Lumber of the Char|nel-hou&s;e. He tugg'd, till he broke off his Trammels, and made his E&s;cape; and the Play, at once, ended with immoderate Fits of Laughter: Even the grave Mr. <HI>Bet|terton</HI>
<Q><L>Smil'd in the Tumult, and enjoy'd the Storm.</L></Q>
