<HEAD>THE
ADVANTAGES
OF
<HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Commerce.</HI></HEAD>
<P>PEACE and Trade have &s;o far got
the Start of War and the Sword,
that the <HI>Trading Nations</HI> of the
World are now become infinitely
&s;uperior in Wealth and Power, to tho&s;e who
might properly be call'd the <HI>Fighting Nations,</HI>
and who&s;e Grandure depended upon the Ex|tent
of their Dominions, and Number of con|quer'd
Countries.</P>
<P>Nor is this Superiority obtain'd by the Po|licy
of their Government, the Prudence of
their Coun&s;els, or the Valour of their Troops,
&s;o much as by the <HI>Increa&s;e of their Com|merce:</HI>
This has enlarg'd their Wealth and
Power, attracted Multitudes to dwell in the
mo&s;t narrow and pre&s;cribed Bounds, and found
<PB N="4" REF="4">
Sub&s;i&s;tence for them, where the Country it
&s;elf could not maintain the tenth Part of
them: By this they have rai&s;ed a Naval
Strength, which has made them terrible at
Sea, as well as formidable on Shore: By
this they have been able, on all Occa&s;ions,
to carry the War home to their Enemies
Coa&s;ts, however di&s;tant, and even in the
remote&s;t Parts of the Globe: By this they
look into every Port, knock at every Door,
command Peace or War; and, in a word,
awe the World.</P>
<P>All the formidable Fleets of <HI>England,
Holland, France, Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Baltick,</HI>
what would they &s;ignify, if the re&s;pective
Countries to which they belong, could not
find able Seamen to man and manage them?
'Tis as they are or not able to do this, that
even tho&s;e Maritime Powers are more or
le&s;s potent at Sea; and this is all in pro|portion
to their Trade. Their Seamen are
the Strength of their Fleet; and tho&s;e Sea|men
are nouri&s;h'd, increas'd, and in Time
of Peace employ'd, and thereby kept up to
their Number, only by Trade; nothing el&s;e
can do it.</P>
<P>Abundance of u&s;eful Inferences might be
drawn from the&s;e Ob&s;ervations; but I wave
them for the pre&s;ent, to bring all down to
the Point I have now more immediately in
view, which is this: That whoever would
learn to know the World, and would go
<PB N="5" REF="5">
the be&s;t and readie&s;t Way to obtain a ju&s;t
Idea of its pre&s;ent State, as well as of the Si|tuation
of the &s;everal Countries in it, has
nothing to do but to &s;tudy Trade.</P>
<P>Learn to under&s;tand the Commerce of
the World, and of cour&s;e you are led in|to
its Geography, or the De&s;cription of its
Situation: By this means you will be in|&s;en&s;ibly
drawn into a Knowledge of the
Di&s;tances of one Country from another, of
their Po&s;ition on the Globe, and how they
&s;tand with re&s;pect to one another: By in|quiring
which way their Commerce is car|ried
on, you nece&s;&s;arily come to know,
whether they are inland Countries, or bor|dering
on the Sea; whether I&s;lands, or con|tiguous
to one another and to the Conti|nent;
whether to be travell'd to and traded
with by Land or by Water, or perhaps by
both.</P>
<P>Nor is the Situation of Nations only
known by the Study of Trade; but by this
Means al&s;o their &s;everal Intere&s;ts are judg'd
of, as al&s;o their Ability to &s;upport one an|other
and them&s;elves, which way their
Strength lies, and how it exerts it &s;elf,
whether by Land or Sea: And all their na|vigable
Rivers and trading Ports are known
by the Navigation which is employ'd between
them, and the Trade which is carried on in
them.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="6">
The Number of the People, the Wealth,
and con&s;equently the Strength of Nations,
are all learnt by the &s;ame Study. By this
you &s;ee the Richne&s;s of their Product, the
Bulk of their Exportations, and Number of
Ships employ'd in their Trade. Even the
Diligence and Application of their People
is judg'd of by the Quantity and Goodne&s;s
of their Manufactures, and the Produce of
their Country appearing in Trade.</P>
<P>To know Trade then is to know the
World: And I may farther ob&s;erve, That
if any one Nation could govern Trade, that
Nation would govern the World; could it
give Laws to the Commerce, it would give
Laws to the People, and the whole World
would be its Dependents and Subjects.</P>
<P>Not &s;o much the Hi&s;tories of pa&s;t Times,
as the many Examples of the pre&s;ent, con|firm
this. The Trading Nations are certain|ly
the mo&s;t formidable at this time; and that
they are &s;o in con&s;equence of their Supe|riority
in Trade, may appear, in that all
tho&s;e Nations, which were formerly great
in Trade, but &s;ince declin'd, are in pro|portion
declin'd in their Strength as their
Trade has fallen off. The City of <HI>Antwerp</HI>
is a noted In&s;tance of this, as are almo&s;t
all the <HI>Hans Towns</HI> in <HI>Germany;</HI> al&s;o <HI>No|vogr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d</HI>
in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and &s;everal others, who&s;e
Hi&s;tory we may find, as it re&s;pects their
former Greatne&s;s, and particularly their pre|&s;ent
<PB N="7" REF="7">
Decay, with the Cau&s;es of it, in the
<HI>Atlas Maritimus,</HI> lately publi&s;h'd, which in
almo&s;t every Part of it confirms this Maxim
by Examples in the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Cities
and States in the World.</P>
<P>The late <HI>French</HI> King, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. (more
ju&s;tly on that account call'd <HI>Great,</HI> than for
the Glory of his Arms) &s;aw plainly that
the Way to make the <HI>French</HI> Nation the
Terror of the World, was not &s;o much by
the Succe&s;s of his Arms, and his Conque&s;ts
upon his Neighbours, as by encouraging
the Commerce of his own Country, and
employing the va&s;t Numbers of People,
which his Dominions were every where full
of, and which he found out of Bu&s;ine&s;s and
&s;tarving, in the &s;everal Branches of Trade,
as Arts, Manufactures, Navigation, Fi&s;hing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
by which means the Poor were every where
&s;et to work, if not made to work, and of
Con&s;equence fed and cloth'd; almo&s;t every
Province being put in a Capacity to feed and
employ their own Hands: and the Effects of
this are, to this Day, very vi&s;ible and plain
in the following In&s;tances.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. His <HI>Tallie</HI> (which is a Tax upon all
the Families of the <HI>Plebeii,</HI> or meaner
trading People only) is vi&s;ibly increas'd,
and rai&s;es now &s;ome Millions more than it
u&s;ually did.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="8" REF="8">
2. His Subjects, e&s;pecially in the ma|nufacturing
and trading Towns, grew rich;
and had he not been oblig'd by the Di|&s;tre&s;s
of the War to oppre&s;s them after|wards
with heavy and almo&s;t in&s;upport|able
Taxes, by which the publick Credit
&s;unk, and grew precarious, and the Bank
of <HI>Lyons</HI> in particular was ruin'd and fail'd,
and the Coin debas'd almo&s;t to nothing, &s;o
that their Crown was not worth the an|tient
<HI>Livre</HI> in exchange: I &s;ay, had not
the&s;e things follow'd by the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of
the War, the common trading People of
<HI>France</HI> had been rich; and 'tis evident
that they grow rich apace &s;ince the War,
by the meer Increa&s;e of their Manufactures
at home.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In a farther Pur&s;uit of the &s;ame Max|ims,
the King turn'd his Eye to the Sea,
and took proper Mea&s;ures for the Increa&s;e
of Shipping, the Encouragement of Sea|men,
the &s;etting up Companies, Fi&s;heries,
and the like, that his Subjects might be
employ'd as well by Water as by Land,
and that he might be able to man and fit
out his Ships of War with able Seamen of
his own; which the <HI>French</HI> have &s;ince
done, but were never able to do before.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Encouragement this gave to his Peo|ple,
and their Opulence by Sea, evidently
appear'd, even to the Terror of <HI>Europe,</HI> in
<PB N="9" REF="9">
the mighty Fleets which he fitted out in a few
Years after he began tho&s;e Regulations; Fleets
&s;uperior even to the united Naval Powers
of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland:</HI> Nor had this Naval
Power of <HI>France</HI> been broken, had it not
been for the meer Arrogance of the King
him&s;elf, who in a mi&s;taken Confidence of his
own Power, po&s;itively order'd Mon&s;. <HI>Tour|ville,</HI>
his Admiral, to fight the Confederate
Fleet, (not thinking they were join'd, and)
whether they were join'd or no; by which
means he was overthrown, and &s;ome of the
fine&s;t Ships in the World &s;et on fire in their
own Ports, and &s;ome even by their own
Hands; a Lo&s;s they never recover'd: But
this by the way. The fitting out &s;uch a
Fleet as the <HI>French</HI> had in the Action at
<HI>Beachy,</HI> in the Year 1690, is fully to the
Point in Hand, where they had 90 Men of
War of the Line, from 55 Guns and up|wards,
among which were no le&s;s than 17
three-Deck Ships, and as I have been told,
above 50000 Men, whereof 32000 were a|ble
Seamen of their own. All the&s;e Advan|ces
in the <HI>French</HI> King's Dominions, by
means of Trade, are at large de&s;crib'd in
the foremention'd Book, to which I refer
the Curious.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Effects of Trade, where the
Increa&s;e and Cultivation of it are made the
Care of the Publick. The States of <HI>Holland</HI>
are another In&s;tance hereof, who&s;e formida|ble
<PB N="10" REF="10">
Power has increas'd with their Trade,
and by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of that only; as on
the other hand, the Decay of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Power (which in the Time of <HI>Philip</HI> II.
was a Terror to the whole World, and was
rais'd on the meer Increa&s;e of their Trade)
has apparently been occa&s;ion'd by the De|cay
of their Trade, out of which they were
every where driven by the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>The whole World, as well Pagan as
Chri&s;tian, is full of Examples of this kind:
But to give one for all the re&s;t; a Com|pari&s;on
between the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Provinces of
<HI>A&s;ia</HI> (&s;uch as we call the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> and
<HI>China</HI>) and the whole Country of <HI>Africa,</HI>
will confirm this Ob&s;ervation beyond all
Contradiction.</P>
<P>We &s;ee the whole Quarter of the World
call'd <HI>Africa,</HI> large to an Extreme, &s;uited by
its Climate and Situation for all manner of
Improvements, as well by Cultivation as
Commerce; populous (at lea&s;t on the Sea
Coa&s;ts) equally almo&s;t to any other Part,
and in &s;ome Places more populous than mo&s;t
other Parts of the World.</P>
<P>Their Ports, Harbours, Rivers and Bays,
were they frequented, and the &s;afe Roads
fully de&s;cribed, are more in number than in
mo&s;t other Countries; and their prodigious
Length of Coa&s;t cannot but render this Part
of the World admirably &s;ituated for the Ad|vantages
of Commerce: For the whole
<PB N="11" REF="11">
Country call'd <HI>Africa</HI> is an I&s;land, except
the &s;mall I&s;thmus or Neck of Land from
<HI>Suez</HI> on the <HI>Red Sea</HI> to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> which
is not above 60 Miles. Nay, &s;o well fitted
for Trade is <HI>Africa,</HI> that a late Author tells,
us, there are more and greater Rivers in it,
and more adapted to Commerce, and to In|land
Navigation, than in all the Country of
<HI>America;</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Carolina</HI>
only excepted.</P>
<P>But in the mid&s;t of all the&s;e Advantages,
thro' the Indolence and Ignorance of the
Natives on one hand, and the barbarous
Tyranny of the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> on the
other, (the <HI>European</HI> Nations having planted
but few Colonies on her Continent) we &s;ee
this whole Country in a manner left de&s;o|late,
no Improvement, no &s;ettled Govern|ment;
but va&s;t Extents of Land neglected,
whole Provinces left wild, and like a <HI>Terra
de&s;erta,</HI> remaining in a meer State of Na|ture:
And all for want of Trade.</P>
<P>The Soil is in many Places very rich,
and the Product of Nature exceeds all the
re&s;t of the known World. The North Coa&s;t,
for almo&s;t 2000 Miles, commonly call'd the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary,</HI> produces the fine&s;t Cop|per,
and in great Quantities: All the Fruits
that the South Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain</HI> is &s;o famous
for, are produced here in the greate&s;t Plenty
and perfection; &s;uch as Rai&s;ins, Pomegra|nates,
Lemons, Oranges, Almonds; and to
&s;um up all, &s;uch a prodigious Quantity of the
<PB N="12" REF="12">
be&s;t Wheat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Capt,</HI> Braithwaite'<HI>s late Hi&s;tory of the Revolutions in</HI> Morocco.</NOTE>, that were it not inhabited by
the wor&s;t of Diones, and govern'd by the
wor&s;t of Tyrants, the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> it
would be the Granary of <HI>Europe:</HI> Where|as
now it is poor, naked, and much of it
barren, and almo&s;t &s;tarves its indolent, un|improving
Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The We&s;t Coa&s;t produces Honey, Wax,
<HI>Guinea</HI> Grains, Furrs, Civet, Drugs and
Gums, of very rich kinds; and be&s;ides all
the&s;e, Gold and Elephants Teeth in abun|dance.
The Ea&s;t Coa&s;t produces Gold and
Teeth al&s;o, and Black Cattle without Num|ber;
and going North from the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Zanguebar</HI> up to the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> it furni&s;hes
<HI>Arabia</HI> with the fine&s;t and be&s;t Breed of
Hor&s;es. And be&s;ides all this, were not the
We&s;t Shore of the <HI>Red Sea</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the
<HI>Turks,</HI> who will &s;uffer no free Trade with
<HI>Aethiopia,</HI> it is not to be expre&s;s'd what a
Scene of Wealth and Commerce would open
it &s;elf there.</P>
<P>And <HI>Africa</HI> is not only thus rich in its
actual Produce, but the Soil is of &s;uch a
Nature as to be capable of va&s;t Improve|ments,
were it duly cultivated and manag'd.
The Author of the <HI>Atlas</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that
the Sugars of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> as
al&s;o Cotton, Ginger, Indico and Cocoa, have
all been try'd there, and thrive to a Wonder:
And other Authors, as well <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as <HI>Dutch,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="13">
concur with him, and tell us that Experi|ments
have been made of the Coffee of
<HI>Mocha,</HI> the Tea of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> &amp;c.
and we are told there are Plants of both
now in the <HI>Africa</HI> Company's Garden at
<HI>Cape-Coa&s;t Ca&s;tle:</HI> And indeed why &s;hould
tho&s;e valuable Productions fail in <HI>Africa,</HI>
when planted in the very &s;ame Climate in
which they grow to &s;uch Perfection in
<HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>China?</HI> But for a farther Ac|count,
and indeed a very particular one, of
the probable 'Improvements that might be
made in this Part of the World, I mu&s;t re|fer
to the Book before mention'd; it not
being po&s;&s;ible to treat particularly of the&s;e
things in the Compa&s;s of &s;o &s;hort a Piece as
this is.</P>
<P>What we have now to ob&s;erve, and which
is to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, is; That with
all this Wealth in Nature, and all the Im|provements
which might be added by the
help of Indu&s;try and Art, there is no Com|merce
worth naming in <HI>Africa.</HI> The Nor|thern
People de&s;pi&s;ing Trade, live by Ra|pine,
being almo&s;t all Cor&s;airs and Pirates;
&s;uch as the <HI>Algerines, Tuni&s;eens</HI> and <HI>Tri|polins,</HI>
together with the <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Sallee</HI>
and <HI>Alfarache</HI> on the North-we&s;t Shore.
The other We&s;tern Coa&s;ts have &s;o little Em|ployment
for the many Millions that inha|bit
it, (I mean from the <HI>Rio Grande</HI> or <HI>Ni|ger,</HI>
North, to the <HI>Congo,</HI> South) that for
<PB N="14" REF="14">
want of Produce they &s;ell one another, and
the People are carried away by Thou&s;ands,
Men, Women and Children, to the Number,
as &s;ome think, of 300000 in a Year, to la|bour
and work for the more diligent <HI>Euro|peans</HI>
in <HI>America.</HI> Here is a flagrant Ex|ample
of the Weakne&s;s and Deficiency of a
Country for want of Trade, in &s;pite of all
the Bounty of Nature, and of the mo&s;t e|vident
Capacity for the be&s;t Trade in the
World.</P>
<P>I might enlarge here upon the Situation
of <HI>Africa</HI> for Improvement and Commerce,
as, its lying between all the Trading Quar|ters
of the World, and its Nearne&s;s to <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
which is the Market for all its Pro|ductions;
al&s;o how it might be encourag'd to
build, and employ Ships, and might rai&s;e a
&s;ufficient Fund of Goods for the Employ|ment
of Shipping, as well as Gold to pay
them. But all this is fully done in the <HI>At|las,</HI>
which gives a di&s;tinct Account of the
Commerce, both as it now is, and as it is
capable of being increas'd; and &s;hews how
much &s;uperior <HI>Africa</HI> would be to <HI>America,</HI>
or even to <HI>India</HI> it &s;elf, if it was encourag'd
by &s;ettled Colonies, as the former, or inha|bited
by a trading manufacturing People, as
the latter. I cannot therefore leave this
Particular, without recommending it to the
Age to &s;tudy the enlarging of Commerce,
the encouraging of Indu&s;try, the planting
<PB N="15" REF="15">
of de&s;olate Countries, and the employing
tho&s;e indolent Nations, who tho they may
be &s;aid to be idle, yet 'tis not &s;o much for
want of Will to work, as for want of &s;ome
to employ them, and in&s;truct them what to
do.</P>
<P>I have now done with one Branch of
the Compari&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> the State of <HI>Africa,</HI>
with re&s;pect to Trade: Let us next look in|to
an Extreme the other Way, I mean in
the <HI>Indies,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Countries of
<HI>Malabar, India Proper, Ceylon, Coromandel,
Bengal, Siam, Pegu, Cochin-China,</HI> with <HI>Chi|na</HI>
it &s;elf, and <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be &s;aid but that the Natives of
&s;ome if not mo&s;t of the&s;e Countries, are
(or were originally) as ignorant and &s;tupid
as the <HI>Negroes</HI> of <HI>Africa;</HI> excepting al|ways
the People of <HI>China,</HI> and even in
<HI>Africa</HI> the People of <HI>Aethiopia.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Indians</HI> are enur'd to Trade, and
have a natural Genius to Indu&s;try and Ap|plication;
and &s;o they fall upon Labour,
whil&s;t the <HI>Africans</HI> are indolent; and &s;pread
their Manufactures, the Work of their Peo|ple,
over the whole World, whereas the o|ther
&s;ell not the Work of the People but
the People them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And what is the Con&s;equence of all this,
but that the&s;e Nations of <HI>India</HI> are rich,
populous and powerful? Nay, the <HI>Mogul,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="16">
who is call'd the mo&s;t powerful Emperor
of <HI>India,</HI> and the <HI>Grand Tartar,</HI> who is
the like in <HI>China,</HI> are made &s;o rich and
&s;trong, meerly by the immen&s;e Wealth ari&s;ing
from their Trade.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> have not any Sea Coa&s;t, ex|cept
along the Ea&s;tern Shore of their Coun|try;
and yet they &s;pread the Sea with their
Ships, and have &s;uch an infinite Number, that
one who de&s;cribes that Country, &s;aid he be|lieved
they had Ships enough to make a
Bridge from thence into <HI>France.</HI> It is &s;up|po&s;ed
he would not be taken literally; but
we may venture to conclude from thence,
that he found there an infinite Number of
Ve&s;&s;els of all kinds.</P>
<P>The Power and Riches of <HI>China</HI> are well
worth a large De&s;cription; as al&s;o the Mul|titude
of Cities, of which &s;ome are &s;o great
as to contain, by Report, 5 or 6,000000
of People; and the Provinces, which how|ever
remote from the Sea, or from the ca|pital
City, are full of con&s;iderable Towns,
large Villages, &s;cattered Hamlets and Dwel|lings,
and all &s;urprizingly full of People.</P>
<P>If we inquire into the Rea&s;on of this, we
&s;hall find it all owing to Trade, and the
mighty Commerce they carry on as well by
Land as by Sea. We &s;ee the Produce of
their Land is coveted by all the <HI>Europeans,</HI>
and by us in particular; witne&s;s, e&s;pecially,
their Tea, their <HI>China</HI> Ware, and &s;everal of
<PB N="17" REF="17">
their Drugs and other Growth of their Soil:
And as for their Manufactures, they were not
only brought hither in va&s;t Quantities, but
they became, as it were, the Terror of <HI>Europe</HI>
in Trade, and of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in particu|lar;
&s;o that we were oblig'd to make Laws to
keep them out, and to prohibit the U&s;e and
Wearing of them; otherwi&s;e they would ru|in
and de&s;troy our own Manufacture.</P>
<P>How the&s;e populous Countries pur&s;ue their
Commerce, and e&s;pecially their Manufac|tures,
with an indefatigable Application, ap|pears
from the immen&s;e Quantity of Goods
they would import upon us, if they were
not prohibited; and the Author of the <HI>At|las</HI>
has prov'd, that the People of <HI>India</HI> and
<HI>China</HI> are able to clothe the whole World
with their Manufactures; and that they
trade with <HI>Europe</HI> infinitely to its Lo&s;s,
and to their own Gain, for that in effect
all the ready Money of the other three
Parts of the World, all the Gold and Silver of
<HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> would be hardly able to
&s;erve for Returns: all which he makes out
very clearly, even to the meane&s;t Capacity.</P>
<P>Hence we &s;ee the Ju&s;tice of the Prohi|bitions
in <HI>England,</HI> and al&s;o in <HI>France;</HI>
I mean the prohibiting the U&s;e and Wear|ing
of the&s;e foreign Manufactures: For if
Commerce be the Life and Soul of a Na|tion's
Pro&s;perity, if we are more or le&s;s
rich and powerful as our Trade is more or
<PB N="18" REF="18">
le&s;s flouri&s;hing; it mu&s;t be under&s;tood of
&s;uch Trade only as we gain by, not of
pernicious Trading, and which we cannot
carry on but to our Lo&s;s. And this may
occa&s;ion &s;ome unu&s;ual Speculations concern|ing
the great Strife we find among the <HI>Eu|ropean</HI>
Powers, about who &s;hall or &s;hall not
carry on this Trade to <HI>India:</HI> For if it be
true, that <HI>Europe</HI> in general lo&s;es by it,
and that it exhau&s;ts the Trea&s;ure of all our
Trading Countries, returning nothing but its
own Produce and its own Manufactures,
and receiving little from us but our Bulli|on
and Coin, which is the E&s;&s;ence of our
Produce (I mean by &V;s here the <HI>Europe|ans;</HI>)
I &s;ay, if this be true, it would be
the undoubted Intere&s;t of all <HI>Europe</HI> to prohi|bit
that Commerce, except what is ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upply of <HI>Europe</HI>'s
Wants, that is to &s;ay, things that we can|not
be without; &s;uch as Salt-petre, Pep|per,
Spices, needful Drugs and Dye-&s;tuffs,
and the like; all which are the natural
Product or Growth of the Country; and
not to meddle with any of their Manufac|tures,
which indeed are the things that in|jure
the Commerce of <HI>Europe,</HI> and impo|veri&s;h
the People.</P>
<P>As to the Coffee and Tea, which are the
two great Articles &s;o much in Demand,
'tis &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that we might
tran&s;plant tho&s;e Vegetables, and many more,
<PB N="19" REF="19">
from <HI>Arabia, India</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> into <HI>Africa;</HI>
and with a very little Application might
rai&s;e them all, and in &s;ufficient Quantities,
in our own Factories on the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Guinea.</HI> This the <HI>Dutch</HI> have begun with
&s;ucce&s;s in relation to the Coffee, which
they have rai&s;ed already in &s;o great a
Quantity at <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">avia,</HI> that they &s;etch very
little now from <HI>Mocha:</HI> And we are told
al&s;o, that they have made another Attempt
for planting Coffee at <HI>Surinam</HI> on the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Nova Audalu&s;ia</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> where
it al&s;o thrives very well. But this is a
Digre&s;&s;ion from the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e; and
for a farther Inquiry into the&s;e things, I
refer the Reader to the foremention'd <HI>Atlas,</HI>
where he will &s;ee them explain'd and treated
on at large.</P>
<P>However, I cannot quit this Di&s;cour&s;e of
the <HI>India</HI> Trade, without hinting as I go,
that I think, while this Part of <HI>Europe</HI> is
&s;o bu&s;ily engag'd, even almo&s;t to a War,
for preventing Encroachments upon this
Trade, it is very &s;trange they &s;hould entire|ly
neglect a Back-Door by which all the
mo&s;t hurtful Part of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade
is like (and very quickly too) to break in
upon them like a Flood, and that with a
Force which they will not find it ea&s;y to
re&s;i&s;t; I mean by the Way of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and
that as well by Caravans over Land from
<HI>China,</HI> as by Water, that is to &s;ay, by a
<PB N="20" REF="20">
River Navigation from the Great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s
Dominions, which is more properly and
particularly call'd <HI>Ea&s;t-India:</HI> Which I &s;hall
have occa&s;ion to mention again by and by.</P>
<P>Let me now &s;peak a little of the Bene|fit
and Advantage of <HI>Peace,</HI> in relation
to <HI>Trade;</HI> as I join'd them together at
fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Peace is certainly the Right Hand of
Trade; it is its Support and Defence: It
is by Peace alone that the flouri&s;hing and
pro&s;perous State of Trade is pre&s;erv'd, if
not procur'd. The Hi&s;tory of our Trade
in <HI>England</HI> would abundantly confirm this.
The fir&s;t Introduction of our Woollen Ma|nufacture
was under the peaceable Reign
of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. During tho&s;e twenty Years,
it took its fir&s;t and deepe&s;t Root. The
next Reign was not &s;o quiet: The Sup|pre&s;&s;ion
of Mona&s;teries at home, the Per|plexities
about the Queens, and the Wars
in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> embara&s;s'd the
Court and the Clergy; but the common
People were generally kept out of the
Quarrel, and their Trade &s;till took root at
home.</P>
<P>Per&s;ecution indeed in the latter End of
King <HI>Henvy</HI> VIII's Reign, and thro' the
whole Reign of his Daughter Queen <HI>Mary;</HI>
nay even during the Reformation in <HI>Ed|ward</HI>
VI's Reign, take them all together,
<PB N="21" REF="21">
hara&s;s'd the People, and extremely interrup|ted
Commerce. In one Reign one &s;ort of
People were unea&s;y, in the next another,
in the third another: Alternately, one Side
and the other fled from their Dwellings,
&s;ecur'd their Effects, and hid them&s;elves for
their Lives. In one Reign one Side rebell'd,
and in another Reign another: In king
<HI>Edward</HI> VI's Reign the <HI>Norfolk</HI> and the
<HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> People rebelled for the Ma&s;s;
in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Time Sir <HI>Thomas Wyatt</HI>
and the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Men rebelled for the Re|formation:
And by all the&s;e things Trade
was interrupted.</P>
<P>When Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> came to the Crown,
Trade flouri&s;h'd in &s;uch a manner as &s;urpriz'd
the World; becau&s;e the Glory of her Arms
gave her an Advantage to &s;pread it abroad,
as we may &s;ay, to all Nations; and the
Root it had taken in the Times of Peace,
under the two <HI>Henrys,</HI> had given the Mer|chants
a Strength of Stock to extend it into
the remote&s;t Parts of the World.</P>
<P>The Queen, whatever Part &s;he bore in
the Wars abroad, always kept her Subjects
in Peace at home; the Intervals occa&s;ion'd
by the In&s;urrection of the Earl of <HI>We&s;tmor|land</HI>
and others, were not worth naming.
This Peace at home, and the Support and
A&s;&s;i&s;tance the Queen gave to her Merchants
abroad, laid the Foundation of the mo&s;t
flouri&s;hing Branches of our Trade, <HI>viz.</HI> our
<PB N="22" REF="22">
<HI>Turkey, Hamborough,</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> Compa|nies;
and e&s;pecially the planting Colonies
abroad, particularly in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>Whoever con&s;ults the above-mention'd
Author, will find, that the Di&s;covery and
peopling of all our mo&s;t con&s;iderable Co|lonies
in <HI>America,</HI> were perform'd in her
Reign; and will &s;ee from what &s;mall Begin|nings
tho&s;e flouri&s;hing Plantations have been
rai&s;ed to their pre&s;ent Greatne&s;s, the peace|able
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion being pre&s;erv'd by the powerful
Influence of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>If War at any time interrupted them, as
the Wars they had with the Natives often
did, their Trade was greatly le&s;&s;en'd, the
Plantations &s;poil'd, and the whole very
much endanger'd; as has been the Ca&s;e of
<HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>New England</HI> more than
once.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Queen's Reign the fir&s;t Voy|ages
were made to the Gold Coa&s;t of <HI>A|frica,</HI>
which we now call <HI>Guinea;</HI> and all
was &s;upported by the Pur&s;es of her Mer|chants
and trading People, grown rich by
the &s;ucce&s;s of Trade in the peaceable Reigns
of her Predece&s;&s;ors: So that in her Reign
it might be &s;aid to arrive to its fir&s;t Glory,
and even to its Meridian Height, counting
one Hundred Years from its Beginning.</P>
<P>It may be true, that the great Succe&s;s of
Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in her Maritime Affairs,
and the Terror of her Name, gave a va&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="23">
Addition to the Glory of her Reign: But
it was her prodigious Extending and En|couraging
the Commerce of her Subjects,
that gave Stability of Greatne&s;s and Power
to the whole Kingdom; and it was upon
the foot of the Greatne&s;s of her Trade, that
the Nation became formidable over the whole
World.</P>
<P>Witne&s;s for this, the Regard &s;hewn to
her Emba&s;&s;ies (which, by the way, con&s;i&s;ted
of Merchants) chiefly at the Courts of <HI>Con|&s;tantinople,
I&s;pahan</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;cow;</HI>
in all which her Merchants were admitted,
and her Letters in their behalf receiv'd with
the greate&s;t Re&s;pect, tho no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter
of State or Envoy had ever been &s;een, or
perhaps heard of, in any of tho&s;e Courts
before.</P>
<P>From hence to this very Day, the Com|merce
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has been the Glory
of our Country, as it is the Fund of our
Power. Kings and Princes may declare War,
and lead Armies, and Victory &s;ometimes at|tend
the fortunate Inferior: But generally
&s;peaking, the longe&s;t Pur&s;e, not the longe&s;t
Sword, gets the Day in the End; and as
nothing can furni&s;h Money like Commerce,
&s;o the Trading Countries have manife&s;tly the
Advantage in a War.</P>
<P>This indeed is a good Rea&s;on why <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
of all other Nations, &s;hould be the
lea&s;t afraid of a War: And yet at the
<PB N="24" REF="24">
&s;ame time let me hint to our Countrymen
who are &s;o forward for Fighting, That we
are likely always to &s;uffer the greate&s;t Di&s;|advantages
in ca&s;e of a War; and the Rea|&s;on
is plain, becau&s;e of our infinite Num|ber
of Ships, and Merchants, and Mer|chants
Effects, which are abroad in every
Corner of the World: No Nation has &s;o
much to lo&s;e, and no Nation can &s;uffer &s;o
great Lo&s;s in ca&s;e of a War.</P>
<P>Therefore I cannot but pay a great De|ference
to the Endeavours of tho&s;e Mini|&s;ters,
who, notwith&s;tanding the Murmurs of
the People, apply them&s;elves to the pre&s;er|ving
the Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> and preventing a
War. War to a Trading Nation is a De|gree
of Death; it is a &s;trong Paralytick, it
&s;tagnates the Blood; and, in a word, is
fatal, if not to the Trade it &s;elf in general,
yet to the Pro&s;perity and Health of it.
And tho our Trade, being the greate&s;t with|out
Di&s;pute in the World, is therefore be&s;t
able to &s;upport us in a War; yet our Trade
too would &s;uffer mo&s;t by a War, even
for this very Rea&s;on, becau&s;e it is the
greate&s;t.</P>
<P>But to look a little abroad again: Other
Nations are vi&s;ibly increas'd in Power by
the Help of their Commerce, as well as
<HI>England;</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> are the next Ex|ample.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="25">
The Author of the <HI>Atlas</HI> gives a di&s;tinct
View of the prodigious Trade they carry
on. He touches upon their &s;mall Begin|nings,
and &s;hews how they were elevated,
meerly by their Commerce, from the <HI>Poor
and Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed States,</HI> the Style in which
they addre&s;&s;ed Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> for Aid
again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to that of the <HI>High
and Mighty Lords the States General,</HI> the
Style in which they now treat both with their
Allies and Enemies.</P>
<P>He de&s;cribes their foreign Trade, their
Fi&s;heries, and their <HI>Greenland</HI> Trade in an
e&s;pecial manner, of which there is indeed
a &s;urprizing Account: He gives the Hi&s;tory
of their fir&s;t Adventures to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI>
and their Progre&s;s and Conque&s;t there over
the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Settlements: He &s;hews the
Glory and Grandeur of their City of <HI>Bata|via;</HI>
and indeed that very Place is a con|vincing
Proof of what I have advanced, the
formidable Power of that City, and of all the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Settlements in the <HI>Indies,</HI> being en|tirely
rai&s;ed by Commerce, without the lea&s;t
A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Government or the publick
Stock in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>He gives an Account likewi&s;e of all their
Inland Trade, the greate&s;t perhaps of its kind
in the World; a Trade wholly carry'd on by
River Navigation, by the Help of Boats,
Hoys, Bylanders, and &s;uch Ve&s;&s;els, upon
the great Rivers of the <HI>Scheld,</HI> the <HI>Maes,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="26">
the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the <HI>Ems</HI> and the <HI>We&s;er;</HI> and
from tho&s;e Rivers again by the <HI>Lys,</HI> the
<HI>Scarp</HI> and <HI>Sambre,</HI> the <HI>Mo&s;elle,</HI> the <HI>Saar,</HI>
the <HI>Maine,</HI> the <HI>Neckar,</HI> and abundance of
other navigable Streams, into the very Heart
of <HI>Germany, France,</HI> and the <HI>Au&s;trian Ne|therlands,</HI>
and quite up into <HI>Switzerland.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis to be ob&s;erv'd here likewi&s;e, that
nothing but Peace could rai&s;e &s;uch a Com|merce
to a People di&s;tre&s;s'd, as they were
before, by all the Extremities of War, to
&s;uch a Degree, that we have been told,
they were once upon the Point of re&s;olving
to &s;hip them&s;elves all off, Poor and Rich,
to quit their Country to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
and go away to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> But the
War ending, fir&s;t in a Truce of twelve Years,
and after that in a perpetual Peace, how
&s;oon did the Ca&s;e alter with them! Peace
rai&s;ed Trade, their Trade rai&s;ed their Wealth,
and their Wealth rai&s;ed their Power; in which
their Fleets are &s;o formidable that, <HI>England</HI>
only excepted, they are able to fight all the
other Maritime Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> I had
almo&s;t &s;aid if they were join'd together.
Here is indeed an undoubted Te&s;timony to
my fir&s;t A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Trading
Nations are the mo&s;t powerful Nations.</P>
<P>I might run thro' the particular Ca&s;es of all
the Nations in <HI>Europe,</HI> but I &s;hall only add
the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> or <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="27">
How feeble this va&s;tly extended Empire
was about thirty Years ago, I need not &s;ay.
They had not one Port in all the Trading
Seas of the World, by which they could
corre&s;pond with any Part of <HI>Europe, Arch|angel</HI>
on the frozen Northern Coa&s;t only ex|cepted.</P>
<P>For
want of this, of what Con&s;ideration
were they in the Account of <HI>Europe</HI>'s
Strength? How little did they weigh in
the Balance of Power? And they were re|garded
in the &s;everal Courts of <HI>Europe</HI> ac|cordingly;
&s;o that the <HI>Turks</HI> told them up|on
&s;ome Occa&s;ion, that they neither under|&s;tood
how to make War or Peace. Thus
contemptible were they, tho at the &s;ame
time the <HI>Czar</HI> had a Country under his
Dominion as big as all the re&s;t of <HI>Europe.</HI>
And the Rea&s;on of all this low Figure they
made, was evidently this, and nothing
el&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That they had no Trade, no
Commerce or Corre&s;pondence with the re&s;t
of the World.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve now the Difference: When the
late Czar <HI>Peter</HI> came to the Government,
and by his Prudence and Politicks ally'd
him&s;elf with the Trading Countries of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
beginning to teach his People the
Arts of Navigation and Commerce; as &s;oon
as he did this, he got Money, rais'd Troops,
&s;hew'd the World that his Men might be
taught to fight as well as other Nations,
<PB N="28" REF="28">
and &s;oon brought them to do &s;o. As &s;oon
as the Pro&s;perity of Trade made them feel
&s;omething of the Advantages accruing by
it, we find him pu&s;hing him&s;elf upon the
<HI>Swedes,</HI> gaining from them the Maritime
Provinces they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in the <HI>Baltick;</HI>
and as he open'd the Seas for his People
to trade, they &s;oon enabled him to &s;pread
tho&s;e Seas with his Men of War, &s;o that
he became an Over-match either for the
<HI>Dane</HI> or the <HI>Swede;</HI> and had he lived a
few Years longer, he would have begun to
appear formidable in the Ocean as well as he
had done in the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>We have &s;een the Succe&s;&s;ors of this Prince,
however unactive in other Matters, extreme|ly
diligent in this of Trade. The pre&s;ent
<HI>Czar</HI> is now e&s;tabli&s;hing the Commerce of
his Subjects to all Parts of the World, and
his Ea&s;tern Commerce in particular in a &s;ur|prizing
manner, as well with <HI>China</HI> as <HI>In|dia,
Per&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Turkey.</HI> This he does
partly by a Communication of Rivers, and
partly by the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and al&s;o by Land.
And this brings me back to what I mention'd
before, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Trade with the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI>
was likely to break in upon <HI>Europe</HI>
this Way, in a Manner too powerful to be
re&s;i&s;ted, and in a Way more fatal than ei|ther
the Emperor's late Company erected at
<HI>O&s;tend,</HI> or any other Rivals what&s;oever.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="29">
It is but a few Days ago, that Letters
from <HI>Petersburg</HI> brought an Account of
the Return of Mon&s;. <HI>Winderowitz,</HI> the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador to the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI>
and of the Succe&s;s of his Emba&s;&s;y at that
Court: How he had &s;ettled the Limits of
the two Empires, which had in vain been
attempted for above &s;ixty Years before; and
withal had made a particular Treaty of Com|merce,
by which a free Trade is e&s;tabli&s;h'd
between the two Empires, and all the Hin|drances,
Scruples, and trouble&s;om Ceremo|nies,
which ob&s;tructed it, and in particular
the Tolls, Pre&s;ents, and other Demands made
by the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Officers at the pa&s;&s;ing the

other Tolls and Payments, Pre&s;ents or Fees
taken at the Entrance into any City or Pro|vince,
which were before uncertain and ar|bitrary,
are all remov'd, and turn'd into one
general Duty or Cu&s;tom of Import and Ex|port,
as in other Countries; and this Duty
or Cu&s;tom to be unalterable, except on due
Notice given on both Sides.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, they have &s;ettled the placing
of Guards in proper Places, and the building
of Caravan&s;eras or fortify'd Inns upon the
Road, for the Reception of Merchants and
their Goods; and the Governours of every
Province are to be made an&s;werable for any
Robberies committed by the <HI>Tartars</HI> or any
other Rovers within their Bounds; due Notice
<PB N="30" REF="30">
being always given of the Approach of &s;uch
Merchants or their Caravans.</P>
<P>By this means they a&s;&s;ure us, that the
Trade between <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> will be as
&s;afe and ea&s;y as it is or can be in <HI>Europe</HI>
between one Province and another; and
that the Caravans &s;hall go and come with
&s;uch Freedom, that there &s;hall arrive in
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> at lea&s;t one great Caravan, con&s;i&s;ting
of four, five, or &s;ix Hundred Camels, a
Month; and &s;ometimes three or four &s;uch in
a Month.</P>
<P>It would be worth while to de&s;cribe here
the Manner of the March of the&s;e Caravans,
how they are furni&s;h'd with Provi&s;ions in
&s;uch great De&s;arts as they are oblig'd to pa&s;s
over; what Hazards they run from the
Robbers and <HI>Tartars</HI> upon the way, and the
like: As al&s;o to de&s;cribe the Way it &s;elf,
and what va&s;t Circuits they take for the Con|venience
of coming to inhabited Countries
and navigable Rivers, e&s;pecially the great Ri|vers
<HI>Janizea</HI> and <HI>Oby,</HI> the River <HI>Irtisk,</HI> and at

but a &s;hort Pa&s;&s;age to the Lakes <HI>Onega</HI> and
<HI>Ladoga,</HI> by which they come to <HI>Petersburg.</HI>
But as this would be too tedious for the nar|row
Compa&s;s of this Work, &s;o it is not &s;o
directly to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>To return therefore to the Point which
is more immediately before me: We are told,
<PB N="31" REF="31">
that the&s;e Mea&s;ures being enter'd into by the
Government of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> the Trade is to be
carry'd on by a Company to be incorpo|rated,
and to be furni&s;h'd with all needful
royal Privileges, and A&s;&s;urances of Protecti|on,
and of a con&s;tant Care of their Intere&s;ts at
the Emperor of <HI>China</HI>'s Court by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI>
Emperor: And we are al&s;o told, that the
Merchants of <HI>Lubec</HI> are, or are to be, very
far intere&s;ted in the &s;aid Company.</P>
<P>The Goods to be imported this Way from
<HI>China,</HI> are (to be &s;ure) all the fine&s;t and mo&s;t
portable; &s;uch as wrought and raw Silks,
the former in the known Variety in which
we u&s;ually imported them from thence; al|&s;o
Gold in Specie, Drugs of various kinds,
and Tea. Whether any of the Goods u&s;ually
brought from the Bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> and other
Parts of <HI>India,</HI> may find their Way by this
Rout, we cannot determine. But if this
Trade &s;hould now be open'd as above, and
all the&s;e Goods be brought upon &s;uch ea&s;y
Terms of Carriage as they a&s;&s;ure us &s;hall be
done, and we &s;hould &s;ee them publickly put
up in open &s;ale at <HI>Petersburg,</HI> and perhaps
at <HI>Lubec;</HI> it naturally leads me to ask, to
what Purpo&s;e is all this Stre&s;s laid upon the
erecting an <HI>O&s;tend</HI> Company? Certainly the
opening a Trade to <HI>India</HI> in general is the
main thing to be con&s;ider'd; not whether
it &s;hall be done by one Nation or another,
one Prince or another: For a Sale of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="32">
and <HI>China</HI> Goods at <HI>Lubec</HI> or at
<HI>O&s;tend,</HI> at <HI>Petersburg</HI> in the Gulph of <HI>Fin|land,</HI>
or at <HI>Trie&s;te</HI> in the Gulph of <HI>Venice,</HI>
is much the &s;ame thing to the Commerce of
<HI>Europe.</HI> Unle&s;s therefore &s;ome Check can
be put to the erecting &s;uch a Company as this,
(and that I do not &s;ee is any way practi|cable)
the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing that at <HI>O&s;tend</HI> does
not, in my Opinion, &s;eem to promi&s;e much
to the Commerce. But to go on with the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Company:</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this Back-Door Trade (for &s;o it
may be ju&s;tly call'd) to <HI>China,</HI> the late Czar
had laid a Scheme for another; and I mu&s;t
acknowledge it &s;eems very practicable, ac|cording
to the Situation of the Country,
and the Sources and Cour&s;es of the Rivers
<HI>Indus, Ganges,</HI> and <HI>Oxus;</HI> as they are laid
down in the &s;aid <HI>Atlas Maritimus.</HI></P>
<P>This Trade, according to the Czar's De&s;ign,
was thus, <HI>viz.</HI> That by a &s;hort Pa&s;&s;age over
Land from the <HI>Ganges</HI> and the <HI>Indus,</HI> the one
running into the Bay of <HI>Bengal</HI> by the Fac|tories
of <HI>Hugeley</HI> and <HI>Calcuta,</HI> and the o|ther
running into the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean not far
from <HI>Suratte,</HI> and between that and the
Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> I &s;ay, the Czar's De&s;ign
was, that Caravans &s;hould be appointed from
both tho&s;e great Rivers to the River <HI>Oxus,</HI>
(the Di&s;tance from either of them being not
above 120 to 140 Miles) and all the rich
Goods of either Coa&s;t of <HI>India,</HI> viz. of the
<PB N="33" REF="33">
Coa&s;t of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Malabar,</HI> by the <HI>Indus,</HI>
and of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel</HI> and <HI>Gol|conda,</HI>
by the <HI>Ganges,</HI> &s;hould be brought
into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea; from thence by Ship
to <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> on the <HI>Wolga;</HI> and from <HI>A&s;|tracan,</HI>
by the <HI>Wolga,</HI> and by the new Ca|nal
which the Czar begun, into the Lake
<HI>Ladoga,</HI> and then by the <HI>Neva</HI> to <HI>Peter&s;|burg.</HI>
So that all this Trade would be
carry'd on by Water from the remote&s;t Parts
of <HI>India,</HI> except about 120 to 140 Miles,
as above.</P>
<P>I need not enumerate all the &s;everal &s;orts
of Goods which would come into <HI>Europe</HI>
by this Pa&s;&s;age; it is enough to &s;ay, that
they would leave us under no Nece&s;&s;ity to
bring any thing about by long Sea, except
the heavy and bulky Goods. As for Spices,
we &s;ee them even already &s;old at <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI>
cheaper than we can buy them here; and
the like of the raw Silk of <HI>Georgia</HI> and
<HI>Guylan,</HI> which has been brought, if I am
not mi&s;inform'd, to <HI>Petersburg,</HI> and thence
to <HI>Lubec</HI> and to <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> cheaper than by
the <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>If the Carriage by the&s;e Rivers and Ca|ravans
does not add too much to the Va|lue
of the&s;e Goods, as we are told it does
not, (the Labour of the People or Cattle
amounting to but very little in tho&s;e Coun|tries)
I do not &s;ee that the immoderate Length
of the Pa&s;&s;age bears any Weight in the Ac|count.
<PB N="34" REF="34">
Be&s;ides, here is one Advantage which
the Pa&s;&s;age by Sea wants, <HI>viz.</HI> here is no
hazard of Lo&s;s, no Premium to be given
for In&s;urance, no Fear of Enemies or Pi|rates,
or of long and chargeable Embargoes,
no Averages to allow upon damag'd Goods,
or Abatement for Goods touch'd with &s;alt
Water.</P>
<P>The Navigation of the Rivers is without
Risk, the Pa&s;&s;age over the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea is
a Trifle; if the Ve&s;&s;els are well built, they
very rarely mi&s;carry: Whereas we find the
Ships, which go on with our Trade, often
&s;ubjected to Lo&s;s and Mi&s;carriage, &s;ometimes
foundring at Sea, blown up by Accident with
Powder, taken by Pirates and Cor&s;airs, as
one of the <HI>O&s;tend</HI> Ships was lately by the
<HI>Turks</HI> of <HI>Barbary:</HI> And it is but a few
Years &s;ince no le&s;s than fourteen Sail of
the be&s;t Ships, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as well as <HI>Dutch,</HI>
very richly laden, were ca&s;t away at the
Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> as they rode there
at Anchor; and all the Goods and People
lo&s;t. If the&s;e Lo&s;&s;es are di&s;counted out of
the Profits of the Company they belong to,
I am of Opinion they would more than
balance the Difference of Freight in &s;even
Years Commerce. But let the Freight or
Carriage be what it will, if they &s;ell their
Goods as cheap at Market as our Com|panies
do or can do, I think the Que&s;tion
is an&s;wer'd; and it appears that the&s;e Back-Doors
<PB N="35" REF="35">
will in a very little time rob <HI>Eu|rope</HI>
of as much Money in their <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Commerce, as not the <HI>O&s;tend</HI> Company on|ly,
but as all the other Companies put to|gether.</P>
<P>Nor
is it po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t I do not &s;ee it
po&s;&s;ible, for all the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> to
prevent it. As for us, and the other Ma|ritime
Powers, our Naval Strength does not
&s;ignify one Farthing to it; for not a Ship,
if we had twenty times as many, can come
near to act in any Capacity in the whole
Trade from <HI>India</HI> to <HI>Petersburg:</HI> Fleets
and Navies are all out of the Que&s;tion;
the Carriage is all by Rivers, except one
great Pond (for the <HI>Mare Ca&s;pium</HI> is no
more;) and the&s;e Rivers, take the Czar and
the Great Mogul together, are all within their
own Territories, and out of every Body's
Reach.</P>
<P>All I &s;ee po&s;&s;ible to be done, is to pro|hibit
Trade with <HI>Petersburg</HI> and the other
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Ports; or, if you will go a &s;horter
Way, to commence a War, and beat the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> out of <HI>Livonia</HI> and <HI>Ingria,</HI> and
&s;o give them no Ingre&s;s to the <HI>Baltick</HI>
Sea; tho this is not &s;o ea&s;y to be done as
&s;ome may imagine: And yet if it were done,
they would &s;till find &s;ome Vent or other
for their Trade; and if they had the Goods,
we &s;hould find &s;ome Way or other to come
at them: For the Pro&s;pect of Gain is al|ways
<PB N="36" REF="36">
&s;uch a Spur to the Merchant, that no|thing
can re&s;train him:
<Q>&mdash;Extremos currit mercator ad Indos.</Q></P>
<P>That this Way of Trade from <HI>India</HI> to
<HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> is not impracticable, may appear
from hence, That it was always one of
the Gates by which the <HI>Indian</HI> Goods found
a Pa&s;&s;age into <HI>Europe,</HI> before the Pa&s;&s;age
by Sea about the Cape of <HI>Good Hope</HI> was
found out. For tho&s;e Goods were brought
from the <HI>Ganges</HI> and the <HI>Indus</HI> to the <HI>Oxus;</HI>
thence, touching at the great City <HI>Per&s;e|polis</HI>
de&s;troy'd by <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI>
down the &s;ame River into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea,
and &s;o into <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> by the <HI>Wolga.</HI> This
Channel of Trade the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> always
kept open; only they did not then find a
Way to carry on the Traffick into the re&s;t
of <HI>Europe,</HI> they having little or no Corre|&s;pondence
with the Princes or Nations of any
part of the World.</P>
<P>It were greatly to be wi&s;h'd indeed, that
the Trade to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>India</HI> were in it
&s;elf a profitable Trade to the re&s;t of <HI>Eu|rope;</HI>
then the opening the&s;e Back-Doors or
By-Channels might be of &s;ome U&s;e to us:
but as it is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s it &s;eems to be
nothing but opening a new Pa&s;&s;age to let
in more Thieves upon us, to carry away
our ready Money; and that neither this
<PB N="37" REF="37">
any more than the <HI>O&s;tend</HI> Company &s;hould
be allow'd, if it could be help'd, nor our
own be allow'd to bring any Goods but
&s;uch as are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for our U&s;e;
and that as to wrought Silks, Callicoes
printed or plain, they &s;hould be all entirely
expell'd, as things utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with
the Pro&s;perity of the Linen, Woollen, and
Silk Manufactures, not of <HI>England</HI> only, but
of all the Nations of <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI> But to
return.</P>
<P>By all the&s;e great Improvements in Trade
we &s;ee now the Opulence and Growth of
Power in the Empire of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia:</HI> 'Twas in|deed
the Czar's Conque&s;ts upon the unfor|tunate
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> which gave him the
Opportunity of launching thus out into
Trade; and being a Prince of a penetrating
Genius, he began him&s;elf, that he might
&s;hew his People the Advantages of Com|merce:
Thus he took Tar, and &s;ome of
his riche&s;t Furrs, and &s;everal other Goods, all
into his own Hands, and traded with them
infinitely to his own Advantage.</P>
<P>Then he erected a Silk Manufacture, and
having the Silk imported by his own Mer|chants
from <HI>Guilan,</HI> cau&s;ed Manufactures,
and Men skill'd in working and weaving
Broad Silks, to be brought from <HI>France:</HI> By
which he pre&s;ently found Means to &s;et up the
Silk Manufacture, and bred his own Subjects
to that and other mechanical Employments.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="38">
Above all he apply'd him&s;elf to the Study
of the Mathematicks, and more particularly
of Navigation, building and fitting out Ships
of War, till we &s;aw him his own Admi|ral
at the Head of a Royal Navy; whereas
he had not one Ship, no not a Yacht to
&s;et his Foot in, when he fir&s;t came into
<HI>England;</HI> nor a Port for them to enter, if
he had had any, <HI>Archangel</HI> in the <HI>White Sea</HI>
excepted.</P>
<P>Now we &s;ee his Subjects trading into <HI>Spain,</HI>
as well as into other Countries, with Ships
of good Burden; and carrying Naval Stores,
the Product of their own Country, into
<HI>France, Spain, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> as well
as to <HI>Lubec,</HI> and <HI>Hamburg,</HI> and other Ports
nearer home.</P>
<P>Since the Conclu&s;ion of the Treaty with
<HI>Sweden,</HI> call'd the Peace of <HI>Abo,</HI> how infi|nitely
are the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> increas'd in Know|ledge,
in Shipping, and indeed in Wealth as
well as Power! and all by Trade, and that
Trade made flouri&s;hing by Peace: And if
their young Emperor pur&s;ues the wi&s;e Mea|&s;ures
of his Grandfather, and encourages the
two in&s;eparable Friends, PEACE and
TRADE, he may in time bring the <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI>
to be the mo&s;t powerful Nation in all
the Northern World.</P>
<P>I might here enlarge upon what I hinted
before. <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;everal Nations having lo&s;t
their Trade, by which they were made &s;o
<PB N="39" REF="39">
formidable and con&s;iderable, they have al&s;o in
proportion &s;unk in their Strength, and lo&s;t
the Weight they bore in the Scale of Power
in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> are an eminent Example
of this, and the <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> both of them in
former times very powerful and rich, but
now much &s;unk thro' want or neglect of
Trade. As the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> lo&s;t their Trade fir&s;t,
and their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea af|terwards,
by the Aggre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Turks;</HI>
&s;o likewi&s;e they abated in Power; and
whereas before they could bring a &s;trong
Fleet into the <HI>Levant</HI> Sea, and di&s;puted e|ven
with the <HI>Venetians</HI> them&s;elves; now
they have not above five or &s;ix Gallies and
not one Man of War in their keeping: &s;o
naturally did their Power decline with their
Commerce.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing may in proportion be
ob&s;erv'd of the <HI>Flemings</HI> in general, and
the City of <HI>Antwerp</HI> in particular; and as
I &s;aid above, of the <HI>Hans Towns,</HI> who were
once &s;o powerful that they beat and burnt
the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Fleet in plain Fight at Sea;
and when any War happen'd in that Part
of the World, whoever had the <HI>Hans</HI> Fleet
on their &s;ide, were &s;ure to conquer: But as
their Trade &s;upported and indeed form'd all
that Power, &s;o their Trade declining, they
are no more a Body, their Power is gone,
and the little Name of a <HI>Hans</HI> or Union of
<PB N="40" REF="40">
Merchants, which once they had and made
&s;uch a Figure with, is &s;unk into &s;carce a
Memorial of it in the City of <HI>Lubec.</HI></P>
<P>The Inference from all this might be very
profitably turn'd upon our &s;elves in the pre|&s;ent
Conjuncture; namely, That if we would
&s;till enjoy our Wealth and Power, our Fame
and Glory, we mu&s;t pre&s;erve our Trade, and
to that End, as far as we can, &s;hould pre&s;erve
the publick Peace al&s;o; &s;eeing <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Trade</HI>
are Handmaids to one another.</P>
