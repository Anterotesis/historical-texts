only one Gentleman, is of &s;uch a

In the Year 1727, <HI>Edmund Curl,</HI> Book|&s;eller,
publi&s;hed a Collection of &s;everal pri|vate

<P>Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI> was acquainted with one

<P>AFTER &s;o long a Silence, as the
many and great Oppre&s;&s;ions I have
&s;igh'd under has occa&s;ion'd, one is at a
Lo&s;s how to begin a Letter to &s;o kind a
Friend as your &s;elf. But as it was always
my Re&s;olution, if I mu&s;t &s;ink to do it as
decently (that is as &s;ilently) as I could: So
when I found my &s;elf plung'd into unfore|&s;een,
and unavoidable Ruin, I retreated
from the World, and in a manner buried
my &s;elf in a di&s;mal Place, where I knew
none, nor none knew me. In this dull
unthinking Way, I have protracted a lin|gering
<PB N="3" REF="6">
Death (for Life it cannot be called)
ever &s;ince you &s;aw me, &s;eque&s;tered from
Company, deprived of my Books, and no|thing
left to conver&s;e with but the Letters
of my dead, or ab&s;ent Friends, among&s;t
which latter I always placed yours, and
Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s in the fir&s;t Rank. I lent &s;ome
of them indeed to an ingenious Per&s;on,
who was &s;o delighted with the Specimen,
that he importun'd me for a Sight of the
re&s;t, which having obtain'd, he conveyed
them to the Pre&s;s, I mu&s;t not &s;ay altoge|ther
with my Con&s;ent, nor wholly without
it. I thought them too good to be lo&s;t in
Oblivion, and no Cau&s;e to apprehend the
di&s;obliging of any. The Publick, <HI>viz.</HI>
All Per&s;ons of Ta&s;te and Judgment,
would be plea&s;ed with &s;o agreeable an

to publi&s;h the &s;olemn and private Profe&s;|&s;ions
of Love, Gratitude and Veneration,

<P>WHEN the&s;e Letters were fir&s;t
printed, I wonder'd how <HI>Curl</HI> could
come by them, and could not but laugh
at the pompous Title; &s;ince whatever you
wrote to me was Humour and familiar
Raillery. As &s;oon as I came from <HI>Ep&s;om,</HI>
I heard you had been to &s;ee me, and I
writ you a &s;hort Letter from <HI>Will</HI>'s, that
I long'd to &s;ee you. Mr. <HI>D&mdash;s</HI> about
that time charg'd me with giving them to
a Mi&s;tre&s;s, which I po&s;itively denied; not
in the lea&s;t, at that time, thinking of it:
But &s;ome time after finding in the News-Papers,
Letters from Lady <HI>Packington,</HI>
Lady <HI>Chudleigh,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Norris,</HI> to the
&s;ame <HI>Sapho,</HI> or <HI>E. T.</HI> I began to fear that
I was guilty. I have never &s;een the&s;e Let|ters
of <HI>Curl</HI>'s, nor would go to his Shop
about them; I have not &s;een this <HI>Sapho,</HI>
alias <HI>E. T.</HI> the&s;e &s;even Years;&mdash;her
writing, <HI>That I gave her them to do what &s;he
would with them,</HI> was &s;training the Point
too far: I thought not of it; nor do I
think &s;he did then: But &s;evere Nece&s;&s;ity,
which catches hold of a Twig, has pro|duced
<PB N="6" REF="9">
all this; which has lain hid, and for|got
by me, &s;o many Years. <HI>Curl</HI> &s;ent me
a Letter la&s;t Week, de&s;iring a po&s;itive An|&s;wer
about this Matter, but finding I would
give him none, he went to <HI>E. T.</HI> and writ
a Po&s;t&s;cript, in her long romantick Letter,
to direct my An&s;wer to his Hou&s;e, but
they not expecting an An&s;wer, &s;ent a young
Man to me, who&s;e Name it &s;eems is <HI>Pat|ti&s;&s;on;</HI>
I told him I &s;hould not write any
thing, but I believed it might be &s;o as &s;he
writ in her Letter. I am extreamly con|cern'd

<P>THO' I writ my long Narrative from
<HI>Ep&s;om</HI> till I was tired, yet was I not
&s;atisfied; left any Doubt &s;hould re&s;t upon
your Mind. I could not make Prote&s;tations
of my Innocence of a grievous Crime; but
I was impatient till I came to Town, that
I might &s;end you tho&s;e Letters, as a clear
Evidence, that I was a perfect Stranger to
all their Proceedings. Should I have pro|te&s;ted
again&s;t it, after the Printing, it
might have been taken for an Attempt to
decry his Purcha&s;e; and as the little Ex|ception
you have taken, has &s;erv'd him to
play his Game upon us for the&s;e two Years;
a new Incident from me might enable him
to play it on for two more:&mdash;The great
Value &s;he expre&s;&s;es for all you write, and
her Pa&s;&s;ion for having them, I believe was
what prevailed upon me to let her keep
them. By the Interval of twelve Years at
lea&s;t, from her Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to the Time of
printing them, 'tis manife&s;t that I had not
the lea&s;t Ground to apprehend &s;uch a De|&s;ign:
But as People in great Straits, bring
forth their Hoards of old Gold, and mo&s;t

valuable Jewels, &s;o <HI>Sapho</HI> had recour&s;e to
her hid Trea&s;ure of Letters, and plaid off,
not only yours to me, but all tho&s;e to
her &s;elf (as the Ladies la&s;t Stake) into the
Pre&s;s.&mdash;As for me, I hope, when you
&s;hall cooly con&s;ider the many thou&s;and
In&s;tances of our being deluded by Females,
&s;ince that great Original of <HI>Adam</HI> by <HI>Eve,</HI>

</LETTER>
<P>This Treatment being extreamly di&s;agree|able
to Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> he was advi&s;ed to recal
any Letters which might happen to be pre|&s;erved
by any of his Friends, particularly
tho&s;e written to Per&s;ons deceas'd, which
would be mo&s;t &s;ubject to &s;uch an Accident.
Many of the&s;e were return'd him.</P>
<P>Some of his Friends advi&s;ed him to print
a Collection him&s;elf, to prevent a wor&s;e;
but this he would by no means agree to.
However, as &s;ome of the Letters &s;erved to
revive &s;everal pa&s;t Scenes of Friend&s;hip, and
others to clear the Truth of <HI>Facts</HI> in which
<PB N="9" REF="12">
he had been mi&s;repre&s;ented by the com|mon
Scribblers, he was induced to pre&s;erve
a few of his own Letters, as well as of his
Friends. The&s;e, as I have been told, he
in&s;erted in TWO BOOKS, &s;ome Originals,
others Copies, with a few Notes and Ex|tracts
here and there added. In the &s;ame
Books he cau&s;ed to be copied &s;ome &s;mall
Pieces in Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e, either of his own,
or his Corre&s;pondents; which, tho' not fi|ni&s;h'd
enough for the Publick, were &s;uch
as the Partiality of any Friend would be
&s;orry to be depriv'd of.</P>
<P>To this Purpo&s;e, an Amanuen&s;is or two
were employ'd by Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> when the
Books were in the Country, and by the
Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> when they were in Town.</P>
<P>It happen'd &s;oon after, that the <HI>Po&s;t|humous
Works</HI> of Mr. <HI>Wycherly</HI> were pub|li&s;h'd,
in &s;uch a Manner, as could no way
increa&s;e the Reputation of that Gentleman,
who had been Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s fir&s;t Corre&s;pon|dent
and Friend; And &s;everal of the&s;e
Letters &s;o fully &s;hew'd the State of that
Ca&s;e, that it was thought but a Ju&s;tice to
Mr. <HI>Wycherly</HI>'s Memory to print a few, to
di&s;credit that Impo&s;ition. The&s;e were ac|cordingly
tran&s;crib'd for the Pre&s;s from the
<HI>Manu&s;cript Books</HI> above-mention'd.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">
They were no &s;ooner printed, but <HI>Ed|mund
Curl</HI> look'd on the&s;e too as his Pro|perty;
for a Copy is extant, which he
corrected in order to another Impre&s;&s;ion,
interlin'd, and added marginal Notes to,
in his own Hand.</P>
<P>He then advertis'd anew the Letters to Mr.
<HI>Cromwell,</HI> with <HI>Additions,</HI> and promis'd In|couragement
to all Per&s;ons who &s;hould &s;end
him more.</P>
<P>This is a Practice frequent with Book&s;el|lers,
to &s;well an Author's Works, in which
they have &s;ome Property, with any Tra&s;h
that can be got from any Hand; or where
they have no &s;uch Works, to procure &s;ome.
<HI>Curl</HI> has in the &s;ame manner &s;ince adver|tiz'd
the <HI>Letters</HI> of Mr. <HI>Prior,</HI> and Mr.
<HI>Addi&s;on.</HI> A Practice highly de&s;erving &s;ome
Check from the Legi&s;lature; &s;ince every
&s;uch Adverti&s;ement, is really a <HI>Watch-word</HI>
to every <HI>Scoundrel</HI> in the Nation, and to
every <HI>Dome&s;tick</HI> of a Family, to get a Pen|ny,
by producing any Scrap of a Man's Wri|ting,
(of what Nature &s;oever) or by picking
his Ma&s;ter's Pocket of Letters and Papers.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t flagrant In&s;tance of this kind
was the Adverti&s;ement of an intended Book,
call'd <HI>Gulliveriana Secunda;</HI> where it was
promis'd <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that <HI>any Thing,</HI> which <HI>any Body</HI>
&s;hould &s;end as Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s or Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s,
&s;hould be printed and in&s;erted <HI>as Theirs.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">
By the&s;e hone&s;t means, Mr. <HI>Curl</HI> went on
encrea&s;ing his Collection; and finding (as
will be &s;een hereafter by No. 5.) a further
Pro&s;pect of doing &s;o, he retarded his Edition

<P>UNder&s;tanding you propo&s;e to write
the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Mr. Pope,</HI> this is only to
inform you, I can &s;end you diver&s;e Me|moirs
which may be &s;erviceable, if your
De&s;ign be really to do him neither Inju&s;tice,
nor &s;hew him Favour. I was well ac|quainted
with his Father, and with the fir&s;t
part of his own Life, tho' &s;ince he has
treated me as a Stranger. It is certain
&s;ome late Pamphlets are not fair in re|&s;pect
to his Father, who was of the youn|ger
Branch of a Family in good Repute in
<HI>Ireland,</HI> and related to the Lords <HI>Downe,</HI>
formerly of the &s;ame Name. He was (as
he hath told me him&s;elf, and he was [very
different from his Son] a mode&s;t and plain
hone&s;t Man) a Po&s;thumous Son, and left
little provided for, his elder Brother having
what &s;mall E&s;tate there was, who afterwards
Study'd and dy'd at <HI>Oxford.</HI> He was put
<PB N="17" REF="20">
to a Merchant in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and acquir'd a
moderate Fortune by Merchandize, which
he quitted at the Revolution in very good
Circum&s;tances, and retir'd to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> For|re&s;t,
where he purchas'd a &s;mall E&s;tate, and
took great Delight in Husbandry and Gar|dens.
His Mother was one of &s;eventeen
Children of <HI>W. Turnor</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> formerly of
<HI>Burfit Hall</HI> in the&mdash;Riding of <HI>York&s;hire.</HI>
Two of her Brothers were kill'd in the
Civil Wars. This is a true Account of
Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s Family and Parentage. Of
his Manners I cannot give &s;o good an one,
yet as I would not wrong any Man, both
ought to be True; and if &s;uch be your
De&s;ign, I may &s;erve you in it, not enter|ing
into any Thing in any wi&s;e Libellous.
You may plea&s;e to direct an An&s;wer in the

Friend of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, in preparing for the

he cau&s;ed a Number over and above to be

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am ju&s;t again going to the Lords to fini&s;h
<HI>Pope.</HI> I de&s;ire you to &s;end me the Sheets
to perfect the fir&s;t fifty Books, and likewi&s;e
the remaining three hundred Books, and
pray be at the <HI>Standard</HI> Tavern this Even|ing,
and I will pay you twenty pounds more.
My Defence is right, I only told the Lords,
I did not know from whence the Books
came, and that my Wife receiv'd them.
This was &s;trict Truth, and prevented all
further Enquiry. The <HI>Lords declar'd</HI> they
had been made <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Tool.</HI> I put my
&s;elf upon this &s;ingle Point, and in&s;i&s;ted, as
there was not any Peer's Letter in the Book,
I had not been guilty of any Breach of Pri|vilege.
<HI>&mdash;Lord</HI> DELAWAR <HI>will be in the
Chair by Ten this Morning,</HI> and the Hou&s;e
will be up before Three.&mdash;I depend that
the Books and the Imperfections will be
&s;ent, and believe of <HI>P. T.</HI> what I hope he
believes of me.</P>

The Book was this Day produc'd, and it
appearing that, contrary to the Adverti&s;e|ment,
there were no Letters of Lords con|tain'd
in it, and con&s;equently not falling un|der

<P>1. I Am fal&s;ly accus'd, 2. I value not any
Man's Change of Temper; I will
never change MY VERACITY for Fal&s;hood,
in owning a Fact of which I am Inno|cent.
3. I did not own the Books came
from <HI>acro&s;s the Water,</HI> nor ever <HI>nam'd
you,</HI> all I &s;aid was, that the Books came
<HI>by Water.</HI> 4. When the Books were
&s;eiz'd I &s;ent my Son to convey a Letter
<PB N="33" REF="36">
to you, and as you told me every body
knew you in <HI>Southwark,</HI> I bid him make
a <HI>&s;trict Enquiry,</HI> as I am &s;ure you wou'd
have done in &s;uch an Exigency. 5. Sir I
HAVE ACTED JUSTLY in this Affair, and that
is what I &s;hall always think wi&s;ely. 6. I
will be kept no longer in the Dark: <HI>P. T.</HI>
is <HI>Will o' the Wi&s;p;</HI> all the Books I have
had are Imperfect; the Fir&s;t 50 had no
Titles nor Prefaces, the la&s;t 5 Bundles
&s;eiz'd by the Lords contain'd but 38 in
each Bundle, which amounts to 190, and
50, is in all but 240 Books. 7. As to the
Lo&s;s of a Future Copy, I de&s;pi&s;e it, nor
will I be concern'd with any more &s;uch
dark &s;u&s;picious Dealers. But now Sir I'll
tell you what I will do; when I have
the Books perfected which I have already
receiv'd, and the re&s;t of the Impre&s;&s;ion
I will pay you for them. But what do
you call this U&s;age? Fir&s;t take a Note
for a Month and then want it to be chang'd
for one of Sir <HI>Richard Hoare</HI>'s&mdash;My
Note is as good, for any Sum I give it, as
the BANK, and &s;hall be as punctually paid.
I always &s;ay, <HI>Gold is better than Paper,</HI>
and 20 <HI>l.</HI> I will pay, if the Books are per|fected
to morrow Morning, and the re&s;t
&s;ent, or to Night is the &s;ame thing to me.
But if this dark conver&s;e goes on, I will
In&s;tantly <HI>reprint the whole Book,</HI> and as
<PB N="34" REF="37">
a Supplement to it, <HI>all the Letters</HI> P. T.
<HI>ever &s;ent me,</HI> of which I have <HI>exact copies;</HI>

You talk of <HI>Tru&s;t; P. T.</HI> has not re|pos'd
any in me, for he has my Mony and
Notes for imperfect Books. Let me &s;ee,
