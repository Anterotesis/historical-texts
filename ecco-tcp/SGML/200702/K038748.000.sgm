<HEAD>LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>APPROACHING towards the clo&s;e of a long period of public &s;ervices, it is natural I &s;hould be de&s;irous to &s;tand well (I hope I do &s;tand tolerably well) with that public, which, with whatever fortune, I have endeavoured faith|fully and zealou&s;ly to &s;erve.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o not a little anxious for &s;ome place in the e&s;timation of the two per&s;ons to whom I addre&s;s this paper. I have always acted with them, and with tho&s;e whom they repre&s;ent. To my knowledge I have not deviated, no not in the minute&s;t point, from their opinions and prin|ciples. Of late, without any alteration in their &s;entiments, or in mine, a difference of a very unu&s;ual nature, and which, under the circum|&s;tances, it is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe, has ari&s;en be|tween us.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">In my journey with them through life, I met Mr. Fox in my road; and I travelled with him very chearfully as long as he appeared to me to pur&s;ue the &s;ame direction with tho&s;e in who&s;e company I &s;et out. In the latter &s;tage of our progre&s;s, a new &s;cheme of liberty and equality was produced in the world; which either daz|zled his imagination, or was &s;uited to &s;ome new walks of ambition, which were then opened to his view. The whole frame and fa&s;hion of his politics appear to have &s;uffered about that time a very material alteration. It is about three years &s;ince, [1790] in con&s;equence of that extraordinary change, that, after a pretty long preceding pe|riod of di&s;tance, coolne&s;s, and want of confi|dence, if not total alienation, on his part, a complete public &s;eparation has been made be|tween that Gentleman and me. Until lately the breach between us appeared reparable. I tru&s;t|ed that time and reflection, and the deci&s;ive ex|perience of the mi&s;chiefs which have flowed from the proceedings and the &s;y&s;tem of France, on which our difference had ari&s;en, as well as the known &s;entiments of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of our common friends upon that &s;ubject, would have brought him to a &s;afer way of thinking. Several of his friends &s;aw no &s;ecurity for keeping things in a proper train after this excur&s;ion of his, but in the re-union of the party on its old grounds, under the Duke of Portland. Mr. Fox, if he plea&s;ed, might have been comprehended in that &s;y&s;tem, with the rank and con&s;ideration to which
<PB N="5" REF="4">
his great talents entitle him, and indeed &s;ecure to him in any party arrangement that <HI>could</HI> be made. The Duke of Portland knows how much I wi&s;hed for, and how earne&s;tly I laboured that re-union, and upon terms that might every way be honourable and advantageous to Mr. Fox.&mdash;His conduct in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion has extingui&s;hed the&s;e hopes for ever.</P>
<P>Mr. Fox has lately publi&s;hed in print, a de|fence of his conduct. On taking into con&s;idera|tion that defence, a &s;ociety of gentlemen, called the Whig Club, thought proper to come to the following re&s;olution:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That their confidence in Mr. Fox is confirmed, &s;trengthened, and en|crea&s;ed, by the calumnies again&s;t him."</Q></P>
<P>To that re&s;olution my two noble friends, the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam, have given their concurrence.</P>
<P>The calumnies &s;uppo&s;ed in that re&s;olution, can be nothing el&s;e than the objections taken to Mr. Fox's conduct in this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament; for to them, and to them alone, the re&s;olution refers. I am one of tho&s;e who have publicly and &s;trongly urged tho&s;e objections. I hope I &s;hall be thought only to do what is nece&s;&s;ary to my ju&s;tification, thus publicly, &s;olemnly, and heavi|ly cen&s;ured by tho&s;e whom I mo&s;t value and e&s;teem, when I firmly contend, that the objec|tions which I, with many other of the friends to
<PB N="6" REF="5">
the Duke of Portland, have made to Mr. Fox's conduct, are not <HI>calumnies,</HI> but founded on truth; that they are not <HI>few,</HI> but many; and that they are not <HI>light and trivial,</HI> but in a very high degree, &s;erious and important.</P>
<P>That I may avoid the imputation of throwing out, even privately, any loo&s;e random imputa|tions again&s;t the public conduct of a Gentleman, for whom I once entertained a very warm affec|tion, and who&s;e abilities I regard with the great|e&s;t admiration, I will put down di&s;tinctly and articulately, &s;ome of the matters of objection which I feel to his late doctrines and proceed|ings, tru&s;ting that I &s;hall be able to demon&s;trate to the friends who&s;e good opinion I would &s;till cultivate, that not levity, nor caprice, nor le&s;s defen&s;ible motives, but that very grave rea&s;ons influence my judgment. I think that the &s;pirit of his late proceedings is wholly alien to our national policy, and to the peace, to the pro&s;pe|rity, and to the legal liberties of this nation, <HI>according to our ancient dome&s;tic and appropriat|ed mode of holding them.</HI></P>
<P>Viewing things in that light, my confidence in him is not encrea&s;ed, but totally de&s;troyed by tho&s;e proceedings. I cannot conceive it a mat|ter of honour or duty (but the direct contrary) in any member of parliament, to continue a &s;y&s;tematic oppo&s;ition for the purpo&s;e of putting Government under difficulties, until Mr. Fox
<PB N="7" REF="6">
(with all his pre&s;ent ideas) &s;hall have the prin|cipal direction of affairs placed in his hands; and until the pre&s;ent body of admini&s;tration (with their ideas and mea&s;ures) is of cour&s;e overturned and di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>To come to particulars:</P>
<P N="1">1. The laws and con&s;titution of the kingdom, entru&s;t the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right of treating with foreign potentates, to the King. This is an undi&s;puted part of the legal prerogative of the Crown. However, notwith&s;tanding this, Mr. Fox, without the knowledge or participa|tion of any one per&s;on in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, with whom he was bound by every par|ty principle, in matters of delicacy and impor|tance, confidentially to communicate, thought proper to &s;end Mr. Adair as his repre&s;entative, and with his cypher, to St. Peter&s;burgh, there to fru&s;trate the objects for which the Mini&s;ter of the Crown was authorized to treat:&mdash;He &s;uc|ceeded in this his de&s;ign, and did actually fru&s;|trate the King's Mini&s;ter in &s;ome of the objects of his negociation.</P>
<P>This proceeding of Mr. Fox does not (as I conceive) amount to ab&s;olute high trea&s;on; Ru&s;|&s;ia, though on bad terms, not having been then declaredly at war with this kingdom. But &s;uch a proceeding is, in law, not very remote from that offence, and is undoubtedly a mo&s;t uncon|&s;titutional
<PB N="8" REF="7">
act and an high trea&s;onable mi&s;de|meanour.</P>
<P>The ligitimate and &s;ure mode of communica|tion between this nation and foreign powers, is rendered uncertain, precarious, and treache|rous, by being divided into two channels, one with a Government, one with the head of a party in oppo&s;ition to that Government; by which means the foreign powers can never be a&s;&s;ured of the real authority or validity of any public tran&s;action what&s;oever.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the advantage taken of the di&s;content which at that time prevailed in parliament and in the nation, to give to an in|dividual an influence directly again&s;t the go|vernment of his country, in a foreign Court, has made a highway into England for the intrigues of foreign Courts in our affairs. This is a &s;ore evil; an evil from which, before this time, Eng|land was more free than any other nation. No|thing can pre&s;erve us from that evil&mdash;which connects cabinet factions with popular factions here and abroad&mdash;but the keeping &s;acred the Crown, as the only channel of communication with every other nation.</P>
<P>This proceeding of Mr. Fox has given a &s;trong countenance and an encouraging example to the doctrines and practices of the Revolution and Con&s;titutional &s;ocieties, and of other mi&s;chievous
<PB N="9" REF="8">
&s;ocieties of that de&s;cription, who, without any legal authority, and even without any corporate capacity are in the habit of propo&s;ing, and to the be&s;t of their power, of forming leagues and alli|ances with France. This proceeding, which ought to be reprobated on all the general princi|ples of Government is, in a more narrow view of things not le&s;s reprehen&s;ible; it tends to the pre|judice of the whole of the Duke of Portland's late party, by di&s;crediting the principles upon which they &s;upported Mr. Fox in the Ru&s;&s;ian bu&s;ine&s;s, as if they of that party al&s;o had proceeded in their Parliamentary oppo&s;ition on the &s;ame mi&s;|chievous principles which actuated Mr. Fox in &s;ending Mr. Adair on his emba&s;&s;y.</P>
<P N="2">2. Very &s;oon after his &s;ending this emba&s;&s;y to Ru&s;&s;ia, that is in &s;pring of 1792, a Covenanting Club or A&s;&s;ociation calling it&s;elf by the ambitious and invidious title of <Q REND="inline">"The Friends of the Peo|ple,"</Q> it was compo&s;ed of many of Mr. Fox's own mo&s;t intimate, per&s;onal and party friends, joined to a very con&s;iderable part of the members of tho&s;e mi&s;chievous a&s;&s;ociations called the Revolu|tion Society and the Con&s;titutional Society. Mr. Fox mu&s;t have been well apprized of the progre&s;s of that Society in every one of its &s;teps, if not of the very origin of it, I certainly was informed of both, who had no connection with the de&s;ign directly or indirectly. His influence over the per&s;ons who compo&s;ed the leading part of that A&s;&s;ociation was, and is unbounded; I hear that
<PB N="10" REF="9">
he expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;approbation of this Club in one ca&s;e (that of Mr. St. John) when his con&s;ent was formerly a&s;ked. Yet he never attempted &s;eri|ou&s;ly to put a &s;top to the A&s;&s;ociation, or to di&s;avow it, or controul, check or modify it in any way what&s;oever; if he had plea&s;ed, without difficulty he might have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it in its beginning, but he encouraged it in every part of its progre&s;s at that particular time when Jacobin Clubs (under the very &s;ame or &s;imilar titles) were making &s;uch dreadful havock in a country not thirty miles from the court of England, and when every mo|tive of moral prudence called for the di&s;courage|ment of Societies formed for the encrea&s;e of po|pular preten&s;ions to power and direction.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the proceedings of this Society of the Friends of the People, as well as others act|ing in the &s;ame &s;pirit, had cau&s;ed a very &s;erious alarm in the mind of the Duke of Portland and of many good patriots, he publicly in the Hou&s;e of Commons, treated their apprehen&s;ions and conduct with the greate&s;t a&s;perity and ridicule. He condemned and vilifyed, in the mo&s;t in&s;ult|ing and outrageous terms, the Proclamation i&s;&s;ued by Government on that occa&s;ion&mdash;though he well knew, that it had pa&s;&s;ed through the Duke of Port|land's hands, that it had received his fulle&s;t ap|probation, and that it was the re&s;ult of an actual interview between that noble Duke and Mr. Pitt. During the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of its merits in the Hou&s;e of Commons, Mr. Fox countenanced and ju&s;tifyed
<PB N="11" REF="10">
the chief promoters of that A&s;&s;ociation; and he received in return, a public a&s;&s;urance from them of an inviolable adherence to him, &s;ingly and per|&s;onally. On account of this proceeding, a very great number (I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, not the lea&s;t grave and wi&s;e part) of the Duke of Portland's friends in Parliament, and many out of Parliament, who are of the &s;ame de&s;cription, have become &s;eparated from that time to this, from Mr. Fox's particular cabal; very few of which cabal are, or ever have, &s;o much as pretended to be attached to the Duke of Portland, or to pay any re&s;pect to him or to his opinions.</P>
<P N="4">4. At the beginning of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, when the &s;ober part of the nation were a &s;econd time gene|rally and ju&s;tly alarmed at the progre&s;s of the French arms on the Continent, and at the &s;pread|ing of their horrid principles and cabals in Eng|land, Mr. Fox did not (as had been u&s;ual in ca&s;es of far le&s;s moment) call together any meeting of the Duke of Portland's, friends in the Hou&s;e of Commons, for the purpo&s;e of taking their opi|nion on the conduct to be pur&s;ued in Parliament at that critical juncture. He concerted his mea|&s;ures (if with any per&s;ons at all) with the friends of Lord Lan&s;down, and tho&s;e calling them&s;elves friends of the people, and others not in the &s;mall|e&s;t degree attached to the Duke of Portland; by which conduct he willfully gave up (in my opi|nion) all preten&s;ions to be con&s;idered of that par|ty, and much more of being con&s;idered as the
<PB N="12" REF="11">
leader and the mouth of it in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons. This could not give much encouragement to tho&s;e who had been &s;eparated from Mr. Fox, on account of his conduct on the fir&s;t proclama|tion, to re-join that party.</P>
<P N="5">5. Not having con&s;ulted any of his party in the Hou&s;e of Commons; and not having con&s;ult|ed them becau&s;e he had rea&s;on to know that the cour&s;e he had re&s;olved to pur&s;ue would be highly di&s;agreeable to them, he repre&s;ented the alarm, which was a &s;econd time given and taken, in &s;till more invidious colours than tho&s;e in which he painted the alarm of the former year. He de|&s;cribed tho&s;e alarms in this manner, altho' the cau&s;e of them was then grown far le&s;s equivocal, and far more urgent. He even went &s;o far as to treat the &s;uppo&s;ition of the growth of a Jacobin &s;pirit in England as a libel on the nation. As to the danger from <HI>abroad,</HI> on the fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, he &s;aid little or nothing on that &s;ubject. He contented him&s;elf with defending the ruling factions in France, and with accu&s;ing the public councils of this kingdom of every &s;ort of evil de|&s;ign on the liberties of the people, declaring di&s;|tinctly, &s;trongly and preci&s;ely, that the whole danger of the nation was from the growth of the power of the crown. The policy of this decla|ration was obvious. It was in &s;ub&s;ervience to the general plan of di&s;abling us to take any &s;teps again&s;t France. To counteract the alarm given by the progre&s;s of Jacobin arms and principles,
<PB N="13" REF="12">
he endeavoured to excite an oppo&s;ite alarm con|cerning the growth of the power of the crown. If the alarm &s;hould prevail, he knew that the na|tion never would be brought by arms to oppo&s;e the growth of the Jacobin empire; becau&s;e it is obvious that war does, in its very nature, nece&s;|&s;itate the Commons con&s;iderably to &s;trengthen the hands of government; and if that &s;trength &s;hould it&s;elf be the object of terror, we could have no war.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the extraordinary and violent &s;peeches of that day, he attributed all the evils which the public had &s;uffered to the proclamation of the preceding &s;ummer, though he had &s;poke in the pre&s;ence of the Duke of Portland's own &s;on, the Marquis of Litchfield, who &s;econded the addre&s;s on that proclamation; and in the pre|&s;ence of the Duke of Portland's brother, Lord Edward Bentinck, and &s;everal others of his be&s;t friends and neare&s;t relations.</P>
<P N="7">7. On that day, that is, on the 13th of Decem|ber 1792, he propo&s;ed an amendment to the ad|dre&s;s, which &s;tands on the journals of the Hou&s;e, and which is, perhaps, the mo&s;t extraordinary record which ever did &s;tand upon them. To in|troduce this amendment, he not only &s;truck out part of the propo&s;ed addre&s;s which alluded to in|&s;urrection, upon the ground of the objections which he took to the legality of the calling toge|ther Parliament, (objections which I mu&s;t ever
<PB N="14" REF="13">
think litigious and &s;ophi&s;tical) but he likewi&s;e &s;truck out that <HI>part which related to the cabals and con&s;piracies of the French faction in England,</HI> altho' their practices and corre&s;pondences were of pub|lic notoriety. Mr. Cooper and Mr. Watt had been deputed from Manche&s;ter to the Jacobins. The&s;e amba&s;&s;adors were received by them as Bri|ti&s;h repre&s;entatives; other deputations of Engli&s;h had been received at the bar of the National A&s;|&s;embly; they had gone the length of giving &s;up|plies to the Jacobin armies, and they, in return, had received promi&s;es of military a&s;&s;i&s;tance to forward their de&s;igns in England; a regular cor|re&s;pondence for fraternizing the two nations had al&s;o been carried on by &s;ocieties in London, with a great number of the Jacobin &s;ocieties in France; this corre&s;pondence had al&s;o for its object the pre|tended improvements of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. What is the mo&s;t remarkable and by much the more mi&s;chievous part of his proceedings that day, Mr. Fox likewi&s;e &s;truck out every thing in the addre&s;s which <HI>related to the tokens of ambition given by France, her aggre&s;&s;ions upon our allies, and the &s;udden and dangerous growth of her power upon every &s;ide</HI>; and in&s;tead of all tho&s;e weighty, and at that time, nece&s;&s;ary matters, by which the Hou&s;e of Commons was (in a cri&s;is, &s;uch as per|haps Europe never &s;tood) to give a&s;&s;urances to our allies, &s;trength to our government, and a check to the common enemy of Europe, he &s;ub&s;tituted nothing but a criminal charge on the conduct of the Briti&s;h government for calling Parliament toge|ther,
<PB N="15" REF="14">
and an engagement to enquire into that conduct.</P>
<P N="8">8. If it had plea&s;ed God to &s;uffer him to pro|ceed in this his project, for the amendment to the addre&s;s, he would for ever have ruined this na|tion, along with the re&s;t of Europe. At home all the Jacobin &s;ocieties, formed for the utter de&s;truc|tion of our Con&s;titution, would have lifted up their heads, which had been beaten down by the two proclamations. The&s;e &s;ocieties would have been infinitely &s;trengthened and multiplied in every quarter; their dangerous foreign communi|cations would have been left abroad and open; the crown would not have been authori&s;ed to take any mea&s;ure whatever for our immediate defence by &s;ea or land. The clo&s;e&s;t, the mo&s;t natural, from many internal as well as external circum&s;tances, the weake&s;t of our allies, Holland, would have been given up, bound hand and foot, to France, ju&s;t on the point of invading that republic. A ge|neral con&s;ternation would have &s;eized upon all Europe; and all alliance with every other power except France, would have been for ever ren|dered impracticable to us. I think it impo&s;&s;ible for any man, who regards the dignity and &s;afety of his country, or indeed the common &s;afety of mankind, ever to forget Mr. Fox's proceedings in that tremendous cri&s;is of all human affairs.</P>
<P N="9">9. Mr. Fox very &s;oon had rea&s;on to be apprized of the general di&s;like of the Duke of Portland's
<PB N="16" REF="15">
friends to his conduct. Some of tho&s;e who had even voted with him, the day after their vote ex|pre&s;&s;ed their abhorrence of his amendment, their &s;en&s;e of its inevitable tendency, and their total alienation from the principles and maxims upon which it was made; yet, the very next day, that is, on Friday, the 14th of December, he brought on what in effect was the very &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, and on the &s;ame principles a <HI>&s;econd</HI> time.</P>
<P N="10">10. Although the Hou&s;e does not u&s;ually fit on Saturday, he a <HI>third</HI> time brought on another pro|po&s;ition, in the &s;ame &s;pirit, and pur&s;ued it with &s;o much heat and per&s;everance as to fit into Sunday; a thing not known in Parliament for many years.</P>
<P N="11">11. In all the&s;e motions and debates he wholly departed from all the political principles relative to France, (con&s;idered merely as a &s;tate, and in|dependent of its Jacobin form of government) which had hitherto been held fundamental in this country, and which he had him&s;elf held more &s;trongly than any man in Parliament. He at that time &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;eparated him&s;elf from tho&s;e to who&s;e &s;entiments he u&s;ed to profe&s;s no &s;mall re|gard, altho' tho&s;e &s;entiments were publicly de|clared. I had then no concern in the party, having been for &s;ome time, with all outrage, excluded from it; but on general principles I mu&s;t &s;ay, that a per&s;on who a&s;&s;umes to be leader of a party com|po&s;ed of freemen and of gentlemen, ought to pay &s;ome degree of deference to their feelings, and
<PB N="17" REF="16">
even to their prejudices. He ought to have &s;ome degree of management for their credit and in|fluence in their country. He &s;hewed &s;o very lit|tle of this delicacy, that he compared the alarm rai&s;ed in the minds of the Duke of Portland's party, (which was his own) an alarm in which they &s;ympathized with the greater part of the na|tion, to the panic produced by the popi&s;h plot in the reign of Charles the &s;econd&mdash;de&s;cribing it to be, as that was, a contrivance of knaves, and believed only by well meaning dupes and madmen.</P>
<P N="12">12. The Monday following (the 17th of De|cember) he pur&s;ued the &s;ame conduct.&mdash;The means u&s;ed in England to co-operate with the Jacobin army in politics agreed; that is, the mi&s;chievous writings circulated with much in|du&s;try and &s;ucce&s;s, as well as the &s;editious clubs at that time, added not a little to the alarm taken by ob&s;erving and well-informed men. The writ|ings and the clubs were two evils which marched together. Mr. Fox di&s;covered the greate&s;t po&s;&s;i|ble di&s;po&s;ition to countenance the one as well as the other of the&s;e two grand in&s;truments of the French &s;y&s;tem. He would hardly con&s;ider any writing what&s;oever, as a libel, or as a fit object of pro&s;ecution. At a time in which the pre&s;s has been the grand in&s;trument of the &s;ubver&s;ion of order, of morals, of religion, and I may &s;ay of human &s;ociety it&s;elf, to carry the doctrines of its
<PB N="18" REF="17">
liberty higher than ever it has been known by in mo&s;t extravagant a&s;&s;erters in France, gave occa|&s;ion to very &s;erious reflections. Mr. Fox treated the a&s;&s;ociation for pro&s;ecuting tho&s;e libels, as tending to prevent the improvements of the hu|man mind, and as a mobbi&s;h tyranny. He thought proper to compare them with the riotous a&s;&s;em|blies of Lord George Gordon in 1780, declaring that he had advi&s;ed his friends in We&s;tmin&s;ter, to &s;ign the a&s;&s;ociation whether they agreed to them or not, in order that they might avoid de&s;truction to their per&s;ons or their hou&s;es, or a de&s;ertion of their &s;hops. This in&s;idious advice tended to con|found tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to the object of the a&s;&s;ociation with the &s;editious, again&s;t whom the a&s;&s;ociation was directed. By this &s;tratagem, the confederacy intended for pre&s;erving the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and the public peace, would be wholly defeated. The Magi&s;trates utterly inca|pable of di&s;tingui&s;hing the friends from the ene|mies of order, would in vain look for &s;upport when they &s;tood in the greate&s;t need of it.</P>
<P N="13">13. Mr. Fox's whole conduct on this occa&s;ion was without example. The very morning after the&s;e violent declamations in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons again&s;t the a&s;&s;ociation, (that is on Tue&s;day the 18th) he went him&s;elf to a meeting of St. George's Pari&s;h, and there &s;igned an a&s;&s;ociation of the nature and tendency of tho&s;e he had the night before &s;o vehemently condemned; and
<PB N="19" REF="18">
&s;everal of his particular and mo&s;t intimate friends, inhabitants of that pari&s;h, attended and &s;igned along with him.</P>
<P N="14">14. Immediately after this extraordinary &s;tep, and in order perfectly to defeat the ends of that a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t Jacobin publications, (which, contrary to his opinions, he had promoted and &s;igned) a mi&s;chievous &s;ociety was formed under his au&s;pices, called, the <HI>Friends of the Liberty of the Pre&s;s.</HI> Their title groundle&s;sly in&s;inuated, that the freedom of the Pre&s;s had lately &s;uffered, or was now threatened with &s;ome violation. This Society was only, in reality, another modification of a Society calling it&s;elf the <HI>Friends of the People,</HI> which, in the preceding &s;ummer had cau&s;ed &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s in the Duke of Portland's mind, and in the minds of &s;everal of his friends. This new Society was compo&s;ed of many, if not mo&s;t of the Members of the Club of the <HI>Friends of the People,</HI> with the addition of a va&s;t multitude of others (&s;uch as Mr. Horne Tooke) of the wor&s;t and mo&s;t &s;editious di&s;po&s;itions that could be &s;ound in the whole kingdom. In the fir&s;t meeting of this Club Mr. Er&s;kine took the lead, and directly (without any di&s;avowal ever &s;ince on Mr. Fox's part) <HI>made u&s;e of his name and authority in favour of its formation and purpo&s;es.</HI> In the &s;ame meet|ing Mr. Er&s;kine had thanks for his defence of <HI>Paine,</HI> which amounted to a complete avowal of that Jacobin incendiary; el&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible how
<PB N="20" REF="19">
Mr. Er&s;kine &s;hould have de&s;erved &s;uch marked applau&s;es for acting merely as a Lawyer for his fee, in the ordinary cour&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="15">15. Indeed Mr. Fox appeared the general pa|tron of all &s;uch per&s;ons and proceedings. When Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and other per&s;ons, for practices of the mo&s;t dangerous kind, in Paris and in London, were removed from the King's Guards, Mr. Fox took occa&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of Commons, heavily to cen&s;ure that act as unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive, and tending to make officers bad citizens. There were few, however, who did not call for &s;ome &s;uch mea&s;ures on the part of Go|vernment, as of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for the King's per&s;onal &s;afety, as well as that of the public; and nothing but the mi&s;taken lenity (with which &s;uch practices were rather di&s;countenanced than pu|ni&s;hed) could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve reprehen&s;ion in what was done with regard to tho&s;e gentlemen.</P>
<P N="16">16. Mr. Fox regularly and &s;y&s;tematically, and with a diligence long unu&s;ual to him, did every thing he could to countenance the &s;ame princi|ple of fraternity and connection with the Jaco|bins abroad, and the National Convention of France, for which tho&s;e officers had been remov|ed from the Guards. For when a Bill (feeble and lax indeed and far &s;hort of the vigour requir|ed by the conjuncture) was brought in for re|moving out of the kingdom the emi&s;&s;aries of
<PB N="21" REF="20">
France, Mr. Fox oppo&s;ed it with all his might. He pur&s;ued a vehement and detailed oppo&s;ition to it through all its &s;tages, de&s;cribing it as a mea|&s;ure contrary to the exi&s;ting treaties between Great Britain and France, as a violation of the law of Nations, and as an outrage on the Great Charter it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="17">17. In the &s;ame manner, and with the &s;ame heat, he oppo&s;ed a bill, which, (though aukward and artful in its con&s;truction) was right and wi&s;e in its principle, and was precedented in the be&s;t times, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary at that juncture, I mean the Traiterous Corre&s;pondence bill. By the&s;e means the enemy, rendered infinitely dangerous by the links of real faction and pretended com|merce, would have been (had Mr. Fox &s;ucceeded) enabled to carry on the war again&s;t us by our own re&s;ources. For this purpo&s;e that enemy would have its agents and traitors in the mid&s;t of us.</P>
<P N="18">18. When at length war was actually declared, by the u&s;urpers in France, again&s;t this kingdom, and declared whil&s;t they were pretending a nego|ciation through Dumourier with Lord Auckland, Mr. Fox continued through the whole of the pro|ceeding, to di&s;credit the national honour and ju&s;|tice, and to throw the entire blame of the war on Parliament and on his own country, as acting with violence, haughtine&s;s, and want of equity. He frequently a&s;&s;erted, both at the time and ever
<PB N="22" REF="21">
&s;ince, that the war, though declared by France, was provoked by us, and that it was wholly un|nece&s;&s;ary and fundamentally unju&s;t. He has lo&s;t no opportunity of railing, in the mo&s;t virulent manner, and in the mo&s;t unmea&s;ured language, again&s;t every foreign power with whom we could now, or at any time, contract any u&s;eful or effectual alliance again&s;t France; declaring that he hoped that no alliance with the&s;e powers was made, or was in a train of being made<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is an exception, that in one of his la&s;t &s;peeches (but not before) Mr. Fox &s;eemed to think, an alliance with Spain might be proper.</NOTE>. He always ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t horror con|cerning &s;uch alliances, &s;o did all his phalanx. Mr. Sheridan, in particular, after one of his invec|tives again&s;t thofe powers, &s;itting by him, &s;aid, with manife&s;t marks of his approbation, that if we mu&s;t go to war, he would rather go to war alone than with &s;uch allies.</P>
<P N="20">20. Immediately after the French declaration of war again&s;t us, Parliament addre&s;&s;ed the king in &s;upport of the war again&s;t them, as ju&s;t and ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and provoked as well as formally declar|ed, again&s;t Great Britain. He did not divide the Hou&s;e upon this mea&s;ure; yet he immediately followed this our &s;olemn Parliamentary engage|ment to the king, with a motion propo&s;ing a &s;et of re&s;olutions, the effect of which was, that the
<PB N="23" REF="22">
two Hou&s;es were to load them&s;elves with every kind of reproach for having made the addre&s;s, which they had ju&s;t carried to the throne. He commenced this long &s;tring of criminatory re&s;o|lutions again&s;t his country (if King, Lords and Commons of Great Britain, and a decided majo|rity without doors, are his country) <HI>with a declara|tion again&s;t intermeddling in the interior concerns of France.</HI> The purport of this re&s;olution of non-interference, is a thing unexampled in the hi&s;tory of the world, when one nation has been actually at war with another. The be&s;t writers on the law of nations give no &s;ort of countenance to this doctrine of non-interference in the extent and manner in which he u&s;ed it, <HI>even when there is no war.</HI> When the war exi&s;ts, not one authority is again&s;t it in all its latitude. His doctrine is equal|ly contrary to the enemy's uniform practice, who, whether in peace or in war, makes it her great aim, not only to change the Government, but to make an entire revolution in the whole of the &s;ocial order in every country.</P>
<P>The object of the la&s;t of this extraordinary &s;tring of re&s;olutions moved by Mr. Fox, was to advi&s;e the Crown not to enter into &s;uch an en|gagement with any foreign power, &s;o as to hin|der us from making a <HI>&s;eparate</HI> peace with France, or which might tend to enable any of tho&s;e powers to introduce in that country, a Govern|ment, other than &s;uch as tho&s;e per&s;ons, whom
<PB N="24" REF="23">
he calls The People of France, &s;hould choo&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;h. In &s;hort, the whole of the&s;e re&s;olu|tions appeared to have but one drift&mdash;namely, the &s;acrifice of our own dome&s;tic dignity and &s;afety, and the independency of Europe, to the &s;upport of this &s;trange mixture of anarchy and tyranny which prevails in France, and which Mr. Fox and his party were plea&s;ed to call a Government. The immediate con&s;equences of the&s;e mea&s;ures was (by an example, the ill ef|fects of which, on the whole world, are not to be calculated) to &s;ecure the robbers of the inno|cent nobility, gentry, and eccle&s;ia&s;tics of France, the enjoyment of the &s;poil they have made of the e&s;tates, hou&s;es, and goods of their fellow-citizens.</P>
<P N="21">21. Not &s;atisfied with moving the&s;e re&s;olu|tions, tending to confirm this horrible tyranny and robbery, and with actually dividing the Hou&s;e on the fir&s;t of the long &s;tring which they compo&s;ed, in a few days afterwards he encou|raged and &s;upported Mr. Grey in producing the very &s;ame &s;trings in a new form, and in mov|ing under the &s;hape of an addre&s;s of Parliament to the Crown, another virulent libel on all its own proceedings in this &s;e&s;&s;ion; in which not only all the ground of the re&s;olutions was again travelled over, but much new inflammatory mat|ter was introduced. In particular, a charge was made, that Great Britain had not interpo&s;ed to
<PB N="25" REF="24">
prevent the la&s;t partition of Poland. On this head the party dwelt very largely, and very vehemently. Mr. Fox's intention, in the choice of this extraordinary topic, was evident enough. He well knows two things; fir&s;t, that no wi&s;e or hone&s;t man can approve of that partition, and without progno&s;ticating great mi&s;chief from it to all countries at &s;ome future time. Second|ly, he knows quite as well, that, let our opi|nions on that partition be what they will, Eng|land, by it&s;elf, is not in a &s;ituation to afford to Poland any a&s;&s;i&s;tance what&s;oever. The purpo&s;e of the introduction of Poli&s;h politics into this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion was not for the &s;ake of Poland, it was to throw an odium upon tho&s;e who are obliged to decline the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, from their im|po&s;&s;ibility of &s;upporting a cau&s;e which they ap|prove, as if we, who think more &s;trongly on this &s;ubject than he does, were of a party again&s;t Poland, becau&s;e we are obliged to act with &s;ome of the authors of that inju&s;tice, again&s;t our com|mon enemy, France. But the great and lead|ing purpo&s;e of this introduction of Poland into the debates on the French war, was to direct the public attention from what was in our power, that is, from a &s;teady co-operation again&s;t France, to a quarrel with the allies for the &s;ake of a Poli&s;h war, which, for any u&s;eful purpo&s;e to Po|land, he knew it was out of our power to make. If England can touch Poland ever &s;o remotely, it mu&s;t be through the medium of alliances.
<PB N="26" REF="25">
But by attacking all the combined powers toge|ther for their &s;uppo&s;ed unju&s;t aggre&s;&s;ion upon France, he bound them by a new common in|tere&s;t, not &s;eperately to join England for the re&s;|cue of Poland. The propo&s;ition could only mean to do what all the papers of his party in the Morning Chronicle have aimed at per&s;uading the public to, through the whole of the la&s;t autumn and winter, and to this hour, that is, to an alliance with the Jacobins of France, for the pretended purpo&s;e of &s;uccouring Poland.&mdash;This curious project would leave to Great Bri|tain no other ally in all Europe, except its old enemy France.</P>
<P N="22">22. Mr. Fox, after the fir&s;t day's di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on the que&s;tion for the addre&s;s, was at length driven to admit (to admit rather than to urge, and that very faintly) that France had di&s;cover|ed ambitions views, which, none of his partizans, that I recollect, (Mr. Sheridan excepted) did, however, either urge or admit. What is remark|able enough, all the points admitted again&s;t the Jacobins, was brought to bear in their favour as much as tho&s;e in which they were defended. But when Mr. Fox admitted that the conduct of the Jacobins did di&s;cover ambition, he al|ways ended his admi&s;&s;ion of their ambitious views by an apology for them, in&s;i&s;ting, that the uni|ver&s;ally ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition &s;hewn to them, ren|dered their ambition a &s;ort of defen&s;ive policy.
<PB N="27" REF="26">
Thus whatever road he travelled, they all ter|minated in recommending a recognition of their pretended Republic, and in the plan of &s;ending an amba&s;&s;ador to it. This was the burden of all his &s;ong, <Q REND="inline">"Every thing that he could rea|&s;onably hope from war, would be obtained from treaty."</Q> It is to be ob&s;erved, however, that in all the&s;e debates, Mr. Fox never once &s;tated to the Hou&s;e, upon what ground it was he con|ceived that all the objects of the French &s;y&s;tem of united fanatici&s;m and ambition, would in|&s;tantly be given up whenever England &s;hould think fit to propo&s;e a treaty. On propo&s;ing &s;o &s;trange a recognition and &s;o humiliating an em|ba&s;&s;y as he moved, he was bound to produce his authority, if any authority he had. He ought to have done this the rather, becau&s;e Le Brun, in his fir&s;t proportions, and in his an|&s;wers to Lord Grenville, defended, <HI>on principle, not on temporary convenience,</HI> every thing which was objected to France, and &s;hewed not the &s;malle&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to give up any one of the points to di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Mr. Fox mu&s;t al&s;o have known, that the Convention had pa&s;&s;ed to the order of the day, on a propo&s;ition to give &s;ome &s;ort of explanation or modification to the ho&s;tile decree of the 19th of November, for exciting in&s;urrection in all countries; a decree known to be peculiarly pointed at Great Britain. The whole proceeding of the French Admini&s;tration was the mo&s;t remote that could be imagined
<PB N="28" REF="27">
from furni&s;hing any indication of a pacific di&s;|po&s;ition, for at the very time in which it was pre|tended that the Jacobins entertained tho&s;e boa&s;t|ed pacific di&s;po&s;itions, at the very time in which Mr. Fox was urging a treaty with them, not con|tent with refu&s;ing a modification of the decree for in&s;urrections, they publi&s;hed their ever-me|morable decree of the 15th of December, 1792, for di&s;organizing every country in Europe into which they &s;hould, on any occa&s;ion, &s;et their foot; and on the 25th and 30th of the &s;ame month, they &s;olemnly, and on the la&s;t of the&s;e days, practically confirmed that decree.</P>
<P N="23">23. But Mr. Fox had him&s;elf taken good care in the negociation he propo&s;ed, that France &s;hould not be obliged to make any very great conce&s;&s;ion to her pre&s;umed moderation&mdash;for he laid down one general comprehen&s;ive rule, with him (as he &s;aid) con&s;tant and inviolable. This rule, in fact, would not only have left to the faction in France, all the property and power they had u&s;urped at home, but mo&s;t, if not all, of the conque&s;ts which by their attrocious perfidy and violence they had made abroad. The principle laid down by Mr. Fox, is this,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That every State in the conclu&s;ion of a war, has a right to avail it&s;elf of its conque&s;ts towards an indemnification.</HI>"</Q>
This principle (true or fal&s;e) is totally contrary to the policy which this country has pur&s;ued with France, at various periods, particularly at the treaty of Ry&s;|wick,
<PB N="29" REF="28">
in the la&s;t century, and at the treaty of Aix|la-chapelle, in this: whatever the merits of this rule may be, in the eyes of neutral judges, it is a rule, which no State&s;men before him ever laid down in favour of the adver&s;e power with whom he was to negociate. The adver&s;e party him&s;elf, may be &s;afely tru&s;ted to take care of his <HI>own</HI> aggrandize|ment. But (as if the black boxes of the &s;everal parties had been exchanged) Mr. Fox's Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, by &s;ome odd mi&s;take, would find him|&s;elf charged with the concerns of France. If we were to leave France as &s;he &s;tood at the time when Mr. Fox propo&s;ed to treat with her, that formida|ble power mu&s;t have been infinitely &s;trengthened, and almo&s;t every power in Europe as much weak|ened, by the extraordinary ba&s;is which he laid for a treaty. For Avignon mu&s;t go from the Pope; Savoy (at lea&s;t) from the King of Sardinia, if not Nice. Liege, Mark, Salm, Deux-Ponts and Bale, mu&s;t be &s;eparated from Germany. On this &s;ide of the Rhine, Liege, at lea&s;t, mu&s;t be lo&s;t to the empire, and added to France. Mr. Fox's gene|ral principle covered all this. How much of the&s;e territories came within his rule, he never attempt|ed to define. He kept a profound &s;ilence as to Germany. As to the Netherlands, he was &s;ome|thing more explicit. He &s;aid, (if I recollect right) that France, on that &s;ide, might expect &s;omething towards &s;trengthening her frontier. As to the remaining parts of the Netherlands, which he &s;uppo&s;ed France might con&s;ent to &s;urrender, he

declared, went &s;o far as that England ought not to permit the Emperor to be repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the remainder of the ten Provinces, but that <HI>the Peo|ple</HI> &s;hould choo&s;e &s;uch a form of independent Government as they liked. This propo&s;ition of Mr. Fox was ju&s;t the arrangement which the u&s;ur|pation in France had all along propo&s;ed to make. As the circum&s;tances were at that time, and have been ever fince, his propo&s;ition fully indicated what Government the Flemings <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have in the &s;tated extent of what was left to them. A Go|vernment &s;o &s;et up in the Netherlands, whether compul&s;ory, or by the choice of the Sans-Culottes, (who he well knew were to be the real electors, and the &s;ole electors) in whatever name it was to exi&s;t, mo&s;t evidently depend for its exi&s;tence, as it has done for its original formation, on France. In reality, it mu&s;t have ended in that point, to which, piece by piece, the French were then ac|tually bringing all the Netherlands; that is, an incorporation with France, as a body of new de|partments, ju&s;t as Savoy and Liege, and the re&s;t of their pretended independent popular &s;ove|reignties, have been united to their republic. Such an arrangement mu&s;t have de&s;troyed Au&s;|ria; it mu&s;t have left Holland always at the mercy of France; it mu&s;t totally and for ever cut off all political communication between England and the Continent. Such mu&s;t have been the &s;ituation of Europe according to Mr. Fox's &s;y&s;tem of poli|tics, however laudable his per&s;onal motives may
<PB N="31" REF="32">
have been in propo&s;ing &s;o completea change in the whole &s;y&s;tem of Great Britain, with regard to all the continental powers.</P>
<P N="24">24. After it had been generally &s;uppo&s;ed that all publick bu&s;ine&s;s was over for the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and that Mr. Fox had exhau&s;ted all the modes of pre&s;&s;ing the French &s;cheme, he thought proper to take a &s;tep beyond every expectation, and which demon&s;trated his wonderful eagerne&s;s and per&s;everance in his cau&s;e, as well as the nature and true character of the cau&s;e it&s;elf. This &s;tep was taken by Mr. Fox immediately after his giv|ing his a&s;&s;ent to the grant of &s;upply voted to him by Mr. Serjeant Adair and a committee of gen|tlemen who a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves to act in the name of the public. In the in&s;trument of his acceptance of this grant, Mr. Fox took occa&s;ion to a&s;&s;ure them, that he would always per&s;evere <HI>in the &s;ame conduct</HI> which had procured to him &s;o honourable a mark of the public approbation. He was as good as his word.</P>
<P N="25">25. It was not long before an opportunity was found, or made, for proving the &s;incerity of his profe&s;&s;ions, and demon&s;trating his gratitude to tho&s;e who had given public and unequivocal marks of approbation of his late conduct. One of the mo&s;t virulent of the Jacobin faction, Mr. Gurney, a banker at Norwich, had all along di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his French politics. By
<PB N="32" REF="33">
the means of this gentleman, and of his a&s;&s;oci|ates of the &s;ame de&s;cription, one of the mo&s;t in|&s;iduous and dangerous hand bills that ever was &s;een, had been circulated at Norwich again&s;t the war, drawn up in an hypocritical tone of compa&s;&s;i|on for the poor. This addre&s;s to the populace of Norwich was to play in concert with an ad|dre&s;s to Mr. Fox, was &s;igned by Mr. Gurney and the higher order of the French fraternity in that town. In this paper Mr. Fox is applauded for his conduct throughout the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and reque&s;ted before the prorogation, to make a motion for an immediate peace with France.</P>
<P N="26">26. Mr. Fox did not revoke to this &s;uit; he readily and thankfully undertook the ta&s;k a&s;&s;ign|ed to him. Not content, however, with merely falling in with their wi&s;hes, he propo&s;ed a ta&s;k on his part to the gentlemen of Norwich which was, <HI>that they &s;hould move the people without doors to petition again&s;t the war.</HI> He &s;aid that without &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, little good could be expected from any thing he might attempt within the walls of the Hou&s;e of Commons. In the mean time to animate his Norwich friends in their endeavours to be&s;iege Parliament, he &s;natched the fir&s;t op|portunity to give notice of a motion, which he very &s;oon after made; namely, to addre&s;s the Crown to make peace with France. The addre&s;s was &s;o worded as to co-operate with the hand bill in bringing forward matter calculated to inflame the manufacturers throughout the kingdom.</P>
<P N="27"><PB N="33" REF="34">27. In &s;upport of his motion he declaimed in the mo&s;t virulent &s;train, even beyond any of his former invectives, again&s;t every power with whom we were then, and are now, acting again&s;t France. In the <HI>moral</HI> forum, &s;ome of the&s;e powers certainly de&s;erve all the ill he &s;aid of them; but the <HI>political</HI> effect aimed at, evidently was to turn our indignation from France, with whom we were at war, upon Ru&s;&s;ia, or Pru&s;&s;ia, or Au&s;tria, or Sardinia, or all of them together. In con&s;equece of his knowledge that we <HI>could</HI> not effectually do <HI>without</HI> them, and his re&s;olu|tion that we <HI>&s;hould</HI> not act <HI>with</HI> them, he there|fore propo&s;ed, that having, as he a&s;&s;erted,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ob|tained the only avowed object of the war (the evacuation of Holland) we ought to conclude an in&s;tant peace."</Q></P>
<P N="28">28. Mr. Fox could not be ignorant of the mi&s;|taken ba&s;is upon which his motion was grounded. He was not ignorant that the attempt of Dumou|rier on Holland (&s;o very near &s;ucceeding) and the navigation of the Scheld (a part of the &s;ame piece), even among the <HI>immediate</HI> cau&s;es, they were by no means the only cau&s;es alledged for Parliament's taking that offence at the proceedings of France, for which the Jacobins were &s;o prompt in declaring war upon this kingdom. Other full as weighty cau&s;es had been alledged: They were, 1. The general overbearing and de&s;perate ambition of that faction. 2. Their actual attacks on every nation in Europe. 3. Their u&s;urpation of territories in the empire with the Governments of which they had no pretence of quarrel. 4. Their perpetual and irrevocable con&s;olidation with their own domini|ons of every territory of the Netherlands, of Germany, and of Italy, of which they got a
<PB N="34" REF="35">
temporary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. 5. The mi&s;chief attend|ing the prevalence of their &s;y&s;tem, which would make the &s;ucce&s;s of their ambitious de&s;igns a new and peculiar &s;pecies of calamity in the world. 6. Their formal public decrees; particularly tho&s;e of the 19th of November and the 15th and 25th of December. 7. Their notorious at|tempts to undermine the con&s;titution of this country. 8. Their public reception of deputa|tions of traitors for that direct purpo&s;e. 9. Their murder of their &s;overeign declared by mo&s;t of the members of the Convention, who &s;poke with their vote (without a di&s;avowal from any) to be perpetrated, as an example to <HI>all</HI> kings and a precedent for <HI>all</HI> &s;ubjects to follow. All the&s;e and not the Scheld alone or the inva&s;ion of Holland were urged by the Mini&s;ter, and by Mr. Wyndham, by my&s;elf, and by others who &s;poke in tho&s;e debates, as cau&s;es for bringing France to a &s;en&s;e of her wrong in the war which &s;he declared again&s;t us. Mr. Fox well knew that not one man argued for the nece&s;&s;ity of a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance to France, who did not &s;tate the war as being for the very exi&s;tence of the &s;ocial order here, and every part of Europe; who did not &s;tate his opinion, that this war was not at all a foreign war of Empire, but as much for our liberties, properties, laws, and religion; and even more &s;o than any we had ever been engaged in. This was the war, which, according to Mr. Fox and Mr. Gurney, we were to abandon, be|fore the enemy had felt, in the &s;lighte&s;t degree, the impre&s;&s;ion of our arms.</P>
<P N="29">29. Had Mr. Fox's di&s;graceful propo&s;al been complied with, this kingdom would have been &s;tained with a blot of perfidy hitherto without an example in our hi&s;tory, and with far le&s;s excu&s;e

than any act of perfidy which we find in the hi&s;|tory of any nation. The moment when by the incredible exertions of Au&s;tria (very little through ours) the temporary deliverance of Holland (in effect our own deliverance) had been atchieved, he advi&s;ed the Hou&s;e in&s;tantly to abandon her to that very enemy, from who&s;e arms &s;he had freed our&s;elves, and the clo&s;e&s;t of our allies.</P>
<P N="30">30. But we are not to be impo&s;ed on by forms of language. We mu&s;t act on the &s;ub&s;tance of things. To abandon Au&s;tria in this manner, was to abandon Holland it&s;elf. For &s;uppo&s;e France, encouraged and &s;trengthened as &s;he mu&s;t have been, by our treacherous de&s;ertion; &s;uppo&s;e France, I &s;ay, to &s;ucceed again&s;t Au&s;tria, (as &s;he had &s;ucceeded the very year before) England would after its di&s;armament, have nothing in the world but the inviolable faith of Jacobini&s;m, and the &s;teady politics of anarchy to depend upon, again&s;t France's renewing the very &s;ame attempts upon Holland, and renewing them (con&s;idering what Holland was and is) with much better pro&s;|pects of &s;ucce&s;s, Mr. Fox mu&s;t have been well aware, that were we to break with the greater Continental Powers, and particularly to come to a rupture with them, in the violent and intempe|rate mode in which he would have made the breach, the defence of Holland again&s;t a foreign enemy, and a &s;trong dome&s;tic faction, mu&s;t here|after re&s;t &s;olely upon England, without the chance of a &s;ingle ally, either on that or on any other oc|ca&s;ion. So far as to the pretended &s;ole object of the war, which Mr. Fox &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o com|pletely obtained, but which then was not at all, and at this day is not completely obtained, as to leave us nothing el&s;e to do, than to cultivate a peaceful quiet corre&s;pondence with tho&s;e quiet,
<PB N="36" REF="37">
peaceable and moderate people, the Jacobins of France.</P>
<P N="31">31. To induce us to this, Mr. Fox laboured hard to make it appear, that the powers with whom we acted, were full as ambitious and as perfidious as the French. This might be true as to <HI>other</HI> nations. They had not, however, been &s;o to <HI>Us</HI> or to Holland. He produced no proof of active ambition and ill faith again&s;t Au&s;tria. But &s;uppo&s;ing the combined powers had been all thus faithle&s;s, and had been all alike &s;o, there was one circum&s;tance which made an e&s;&s;ential diffe|rence between them and France. I need not be at the trouble of conte&s;ting this point, (which, however, in this latitude, and as at all affecting Great Britain and Holland, I deny utterly.) Be it &s;o. But the great monarchies have it in their power to keep their faith <HI>if they plea&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e they are governments of e&s;tabli&s;hed and recog|nized authority at home and abroad. France had in reality, no government. The very factions who exerci&s;ed power, had no &s;tability. The French Convention had no power of peace or war. Suppo&s;ing the Convention to be free (mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly it was not) they had &s;hewn no di&s;po&s;i|tion to abandon their projects.&mdash;Though long dri|ven out of Leige, it was not many days before Mr. Fox's motion, that they &s;till continued to claim it as a country, which their principles of fraternity bound them to protect, that is, to &s;ubdue and to regulate at their plea&s;ure. That party which Mr. Fox inclined mo&s;t to favour and tru&s;t, and from which he mu&s;t have received his a&s;&s;urances (if any he did receive) that is the <HI>Bri&s;&s;otins,</HI> were then either pri&s;oners or fugitives. The party which prevailed over them (that of Danton and Marat) was it&s;elf in a tottering condition, and was di&s;|owned by a very great part of France. To &s;ay
<PB N="37" REF="38">
nothing of the Royal party who were powerful and growing, and who had full as good a right to claim to be the legitimate Government as any of the Pari&s;ian factions with whom he propo&s;ed to treat&mdash;or rather (as it &s;eemed to me) to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P N="32">32. But when Mr. Fox began to come from his general hopes of the moderation of the Jacobins to particulars, he put the ca&s;e, that they might not perhaps be willing to &s;urrender Savoy. He cer|tainly was not willing to conte&s;t that point with them; but plainly and explicitly (as I under&s;tood him) propo&s;ed to let them keep it; though he knew (or he was much wor&s;e informed than he would be thought) that England had at the very time, agreed on the terms of a treaty with the King of Sardinia, of which the recovery of Savoy was the <HI>Ca&s;us Federis.</HI> In the teeth of this treaty Mr. Fox propo&s;ed a direct and mo&s;t &s;candalous breach of our faith, formally and recently given. But to &s;urrender Savoy, was to &s;urrender a great deal more than &s;o many &s;quare acres of land, or &s;o much revenue. In its con&s;equences the &s;urrender of Savoy, was to make a &s;urrender to France of Switzerland and Italy, of both which countries, Savoy is the key&mdash;as it is known to ordinary &s;peculators in politics, though it may not be known to the weavers of Norwich, who, it &s;eems are, by Mr. Fox, called to be the judges in this matter.</P>
<P N="33">33. A &s;ure way indeed, to encourage France not to make a &s;urrender of this key of Italy and Switzerland, or of Mayence, the key of Germany, or of any other object what&s;oever which &s;he holds, is to let her &s;ee, <HI>that the people of England rai&s;e a clamour again&s;t the war before terms are &s;o much as propo&s;ed on any &s;ide.</HI> From that moment, the Ja|cobins
<PB N="38" REF="39">
would be ma&s;ters of the terms.&mdash;They would know, that Parliament, at all hazards, would force the King to a &s;eparate peace. The crown could not, in that ca&s;e, have any u&s;e of its judgment. Parliament could not po&s;&s;e&s;s more judgment than the crown, when be&s;ieged (as Mr. Fox propo&s;ed to Mr. Gurney) by the cries of the manufacturers. This de&s;cription of men, Mr. Fox endeavoured in his &s;peech, by every method, to irritate and inflame. In effect his two &s;peeches were, through the whole, nothing more than an amplification of the Norwich hand-bill. He re&s;ted the greate&s;t part of his argument on the di&s;tre&s;s of trade, which he attributed to the war, though it was obvious, to any tolerably good ob&s;ervation, and much more mu&s;t have been clear to &s;uch an ob&s;ervation as his, that the then difficulties of the trade and manufactures would have no &s;ort of con|nection with our &s;hare in it. The war had hardly begun. We had &s;uffered neither by &s;poil, nor by defeat, nor by di&s;grace of any kind. Public cre|dit was &s;o little impaired, that in&s;tead of being &s;upported by any extraordinary aids from indivi|duals, it advanced a credit to individuals to the amount of five millions, for the &s;upport of trade and manufactures, under their temporary difficul|ties; a thing before never heard of;&mdash;a thing of which I do not commend the policy&mdash;but only &s;tate it, to &s;hew, that Mr. Fox's ideas of the effects of war were without any trace of foundation.</P>
<P N="33">33. It is impo&s;&s;ible not to connect the argu|ments and proceedings of a party with that of its leader&mdash;e&s;pecially when not di&s;avowed or con|trolled by him. Mr. Fox's partizans declaim again&s;t all the powers of Europe, except the Jacobins, ju&s;t as he does; but not having the &s;ame rea&s;ons for management and caution which
<PB N="39" REF="40">
he has, they &s;peak out. He &s;atisfies him&s;elf merely with making his invectives, and leaves others to draw the conclu&s;ion. But they pro|duce their Poli&s;h interpo&s;ition, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of leading to a French alliance. They urge their French peace, in order to make a junction with the Jacobins to oppo&s;e the powers, whom, in their language, they call de&s;pots, and their leagues, a combination of de&s;pots. In|deed, no man can look on the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of Europe with the lea&s;t degree of di&s;cernment, who will not be thoroughly convinced, that Eng|land mu&s;t be the fa&s;t friend or the determined enemy of France. There is no medium; and I do not think Mr. Fox to be &s;o dull as not to ob&s;erve this. His peace would involve us in&s;tantly in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and mo&s;t ruinous wars; at the &s;ame time that it would not have made a broad highway (acro&s;s which no human wi&s;dom could put an effectual barrier) for a mu|tual intercour&s;e with the fraternizing Jacobins on both &s;ides. The con&s;equences of which, tho&s;e will certainly not provide again&s;t, who do not dread or di&s;like them.</P>
<P N="34">34. It is not ami&s;s in this place to enter a lit|tle more fully into the &s;pirit of the principal ar|guments on which Mr. Fox thought proper to re&s;t this his grand and concluding motion, particular|ly &s;uch as were drawn from the internal &s;tate of our affairs. Under a &s;pecious appearance (not uncommonly put on by men of un&s;crupulous am|bition) that of tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion to the poor; he did his be&s;t to appeal to the judgments of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t ignorant of the people on the merits of the war. He had before done &s;omething of the &s;ame dangerous kind in his printed letter. The ground of a political war is
<PB N="40" REF="41">
of all things that which the poor labourer and manufacturer are the lea&s;t capable of conceiving. This &s;ort of people know in general that they mu&s;t &s;uffer by war. It is a matter to which they are &s;ufficiently competent, becau&s;e it is a matter of feeling. The <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of a war are not matters of feeling, but of rea&s;on and fore&s;ight, and often of remote con&s;iderations, and of a very great combi|nation of circum&s;tances, which <HI>they</HI> are utterly in|capable of comprehending; and, indeed, it is not every man in the highe&s;t cla&s;&s;es who is altogether equal to it. Nothing, in a general &s;en&s;e, appears to me le&s;s fair and ju&s;tifiable (even if no attempt were made to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions) than to &s;ubmit a mat|ter on di&s;cu&s;&s;ion to a tribunal incapable of judg|ing of more than <HI>one &s;ide</HI> of the que&s;tion. It is at lea&s;t as unju&s;tifiable to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions of &s;uch judges again&s;t <HI>that &s;ide,</HI> in favour of which they cannot &s;o much as comprehend the arguments. Before the prevalence of the French &s;y&s;tem (which as far as it has gone has extingui&s;hed the &s;aluta|ry prejudice called our country) nobody was more &s;en&s;ible of this important truth than Mr. Fox; and nothing was more proper and pertinent, or was more felt at the time, than his reprimand to Mr. Wilberforce for an incon&s;iderate expre&s;&s;ion which tended to call in the judgment of the poor, to e&s;timate the policy of war upon the &s;tandard of the taxes they may be obliged to pay towards its &s;upport.</P>
<P N="35">35. It is fatally known, that the great object of the Jacobin &s;y&s;tem is to excite the lowe&s;t de&s;crip|tion of the people to range them&s;elves under am|bitious men, for the pillage and de&s;truction of the more eminent orders and cla&s;&s;es of the communi|ty. The thing, therefore, that a man not fanati|cally attached to that dreadful project would mo&s;t
<PB N="41" REF="42">
&s;tudiou&s;ly avoid, is, to act a part with the French <HI>Propagandi&s;ts,</HI> in attributing (as they con&s;tantly do) all wars, and all the con&s;equences of wars, to the pride of tho&s;e orders, and to their contempt of the weak and indigent part of the &s;ociety. The ruling Jacobins in&s;i&s;t upon it, that even the wars which they carry on with &s;o much ob&s;tinacy again&s;t all nations, are made to prevent the poor from any longer being the in&s;truments and victims of kings, nobles, and the ari&s;tocracy of burghers and rich men. They pretend that the de&s;truction of kings, nobles, and the ari&s;tocracy of burghers and rich men, is the only means of e&s;tabli&s;hing an univer&s;al and perpetual peace. This is the great drift of all their writings from the meeting of the &s;tates of France, in 1789, to the publication of the la&s;t Morning Chronicle. They in&s;i&s;t that even the war, which with &s;o much boldne&s;s they have declared again&s;t all nations, is to prevent the poor from becoming the in&s;truments and victims of the&s;e per&s;ons and de&s;criptions. It is but too ea&s;y, if you once teach poor labourers and mechanics to defy their prejudices, and as this has been done with an indu&s;try &s;carcely credible, to &s;ub&s;titute the principles of fraternity in the room of that &s;aluta|ry prejudice called our Country, it is, I &s;ay, but too ea&s;y to per&s;uade them, agreeably to what Mr. Fox hints in his public letter, that this war is, and that the other wars have been, the wars of Kings; it is ea&s;y to per&s;uade them, that the terrors even of a foreign conque&s;t are not terrors for <HI>them.</HI>&mdash;It is ea&s;y to per&s;uade them that, for their part, <HI>they</HI> have nothing to lo&s;e; and that their condi|tion is not likely to be altered for the wor&s;e, whatever party many happen to prevail in the war. Under any circum&s;tances this doctrine is highly dangerous, as it tends to make &s;eparate parties of the higher and lower orders, and to put their in|tere&s;ts
<PB N="42" REF="43">
on a different bottom. But if the enemy you have to deal with &s;hould appear, as France now appears, under the very name and title of the deliverer of the poor, and the cha&s;ti&s;er of the rich, the former cla&s;s would readily become, not an in|different &s;pectator of the war, but would be ready to enli&s;t in the faction of the enemy; which they would con&s;ider, though under a foreign name, to be more connected with them than an adver&s;e de|&s;cription in the &s;ame land. All the props of &s;o|ciety would be drawn from us by the&s;e doctrines, and the very foundations of the public defence would give way in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P N="36">36. There is no point which the faction of fra|ternity in England have laboured more, than to ex|cite in the poor the horror of any war with France upon any occa&s;ion.&mdash;When they found that their open attacks upon our con&s;titution in favour of a French Republic were for the pre&s;ent repelled&mdash;they put that matter out of &s;ight, and have taken the more plau&s;ible and popular ground of general peace, upon merely general principles, although the&s;e very men in the corre&s;pondence of their Clubs with tho&s;e of France, had reprobated the neutrality which now they &s;o earne&s;tly pre&s;s. But, in reality, their maxim was and is, <Q REND="inline">"Peace and alliance with France, and war with the re&s;t of the world."</Q></P>
<P N="37">37. This la&s;t motion of Mr. Fox bound up the whole of his politics during the &s;e&s;&s;ions. This mo|tion had many circum&s;tances, particularly in the Norwich corre&s;pondence, by which the mi&s;chief of all the others, was aggravated beyond mea&s;ure. Yet, this la&s;t motion, for the wor&s;t of Mr. Fox's proceedings was the be&s;t &s;upported of any of them, except his amendment to the addre&s;s. The
<PB N="43" REF="44">
Duke of Portland had directly engaged to &s;upport the war.&mdash;Here was a motion as directly made to force the crown to put an end to it before a blow had been &s;truck. The efforts of the faction have &s;o far prevailed that &s;ome of his Grace's neare&s;t friends have actually voted for that motion: &s;ome, after &s;hewing them&s;elves, went away&mdash;others did not appear at all. So it mu&s;t be where a man is for any time &s;upported from per&s;onal con&s;iderations, without reference to his public conduct. Through the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s, the &s;pirit of fraternity appears to me to have been the governing principle. It might be &s;hameful for any man, above the vul|gar, to &s;hew &s;o blind a partiality even to his own country, as Mr. Fox appears, on all occa&s;ions, this &s;e&s;&s;ion, to have &s;hewn to France. Had Mr. Fox been a Mini&s;ter, and proceeded on the principles laid down by him, I believe there is little doubt he would have been con&s;idered as the mo&s;t criminal &s;tate&s;man that ever lived in this country. I do not know why a &s;tate&s;man out of place is not to be judged in the &s;ame manner, unle&s;s we can excu&s;e him by pleading in his favour a total indifference to principle; and that he would act and think in quite a different way if he were in office. This I will not &s;uppo&s;e. One may think better of him; and that in ca&s;e of his power he might change his mind. But &s;uppo&s;ing, from better or from wor&s;e motives, he might change his mind on his acqui&s;i|tion of the favour of the crown, I &s;eriou&s;ly fear that if the king &s;hould to-morrow put power into his hands, and that his good genius would in&s;pire him with maxims very different from tho&s;e he has promulgated, he would not be able to get the bet|ter of the ill temper, and the ill doctrines he has been the means of exciting and propagating throughout the kingdom. From the very begin|ning of their inhuman and unprovoked rebellion
<PB N="44" REF="45">
and tyrannic u&s;urpation, he has covered the pre|dominant faction in France, and their adherents here, with the mo&s;t exaggerated panegyrics; nei|ther has he mi&s;&s;ed a &s;ingle opportunity of abu&s;ing and villifying tho&s;e, who in uniform concurrence with the Duke of Portland's and Lord Fitzwilliam's opinion, have maintained the true grounds of the Revolution &s;ettlement in 1688. He lamented all the defeats of the French; he rejoiced in all their victories; even when tho&s;e victories threatened to overwhelm the Continent of Europe, and by facilitating their means of penetrating Holland, to bring this mo&s;t dreadful of all evils with irre&s;i&s;tible force to the very doors, if not into the very heart of our country. To this hour he always &s;peaks of every thought of overturning the French Jaco|bini&s;m by force, on the part of any power what|&s;oever, as an attempt unju&s;t and cruel; and which he reprobates with horror. If any of the French Jacobin leaders be &s;poken of with hatred or &s;corn, he falls upon tho&s;e that take that liberty, with all the zeal and warmth with which men of honour defend their particular and bo&s;om friends, when attacked. He always repre&s;ents their cau&s;e as a cau&s;e of liberty, and all who oppo&s;e it as partizans of de&s;poti&s;m. He ob&s;tinately continues to con&s;ider the great and growing vices, crimes and di&s;orders of that country as only evils of pa&s;&s;age, which are to produce a permanently happy &s;tate of order and freedom. He repre&s;ents the&s;e di&s;orders exactly in the &s;ame way, and with the &s;ame limitations which are u&s;ed by one of the two great Jacobin factions, I mean that of PETION and BRISSOT. Like them he &s;tudiou&s;ly confines his horror and reprobation only to the ma&s;&s;acres of the &s;econd of September, and pa&s;&s;es by tho&s;e of the 10th of Augu&s;t, as well as the impri&s;onment and depo&s;ition of the king, which were the con&s;equences of that day, as
<PB N="45" REF="46">
indeed were the ma&s;&s;acres them&s;elves to which he confines his cen&s;ure, though they were not actually perpetrated till early in September. Like that faction, he condemns, not the depo&s;ition, or the propo&s;ed exile, or perpetual impri&s;onment, but only the murder of the king. Mr. SHERIDAN on every occa&s;ion, palliates all their ma&s;&s;acres commit|ted in every part of France, as the effects of a natural indignation at the exorbitances of de&s;po|ti&s;m, and of the dread of the people of returning under that yoke.&mdash;He has thus taken occa&s;ion to load, not the actors in this wickedne&s;s, but the Government of a mild, merciful, beneficent and patriotic Prince, and his &s;uffering faithful &s;ubjects, with all the crimes of the new anarchical tyranny, under which the new one has been murdered, and the others are oppre&s;&s;ed. Tho&s;e continual either prai&s;es or palliating apologies of every thing done in France, and tho&s;e invectives as uniformly vo|mitted out upon all tho&s;e who ventured to expre&s;s their di&s;approbation of &s;uch proceedings, coming from a man of Mr. Fox's fame and authority, and one who is con&s;idered as the per&s;on to whom a great party of the wealthie&s;t men in the kingdom look up, has been the cau&s;e why the principle of the French fraternity formerly gained the ground which it had obtained. It will infallibly recover it&s;elf again, and in ten times a greater degree, if the kind of peace, in the manner which he preaches, ever &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed with the reigning faction in France.</P>
<P N="38">38. So far as the French practices with regard to France and the other powers of Europe&mdash;as to their principles and doctrines, with regard to the con&s;tituton of &s;tates, Mr. Fox &s;tudiou&s;ly, on all oc|ca&s;ions, and indeed when no occa&s;ion calls for it, (as on the Debate of the petition for Reform) brings
<PB N="46" REF="47">
forward and a&s;&s;erts their fundamental and fatal principle, pregnant with every mi&s;chief and every crime, namely, that <Q REND="inline">"in every country the people is the legitimate &s;overeign,"</Q> exactly conformable to the Declaration of the French Clubs and Legi&s;la|tors.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"La Souverainet&eacute; e&s;t <HI>une, indivi&s;ible, inali|enable, et impre&s;criptible.</HI> Elle appertient a la nation. Aucune <HI>Section</HI> du-peuple, ni aucun <HI>Individu</HI> ne peut &s;'en attribuer l'exerci&s;e."</Q>
It con&s;ounds, in a manner equally mi&s;chievous and &s;tupid, the origin of a government from the people with its continuance in their hands. I believe, that no &s;uch doctrine has ever been heard of in any pub|lic act of any government what&s;oever, until it was adopted (I think from the writings of Rou&s;&s;eau) by the French a&s;&s;emblies, who have made it the ba&s;is of their con&s;titution at home, and of the matter of their apo&s;tate in every country. The&s;e and other wild declarations of ab&s;tract principle, Mr. Fox &s;ays, are in them&s;elves perfectly right and true; tho' in &s;ome ca&s;es he allows the French draw ab&s;urd con&s;equences from them. But I conceive he is mi&s;taken. The con&s;equences are mo&s;t logically, tho' mo&s;t mi&s;chievou&s;ly drawn from the premi&s;es and principles by that wicked and ungracious, fac|tion. The fault is in the foundation.</P>
<P N="39">39. Before &s;ociety, in a multitude of men, it is obvious, that &s;overeignty and &s;ubjection are ideas which cannot exi&s;t. It is the compact on which &s;ociety is formed that makes both. But to &s;uppo&s;e the people, contrary to their compacts, both to give away and retain the &s;ame thing, is altogether ab&s;urd. It is wor&s;e, for it &s;uppo&s;es in &s;ome things combination of men a power and right of always di&s;&s;olving the &s;ocial union; which power, however, if it exi&s;ts, renders them again as little &s;overeigns as &s;ubjects, but a mere unconnected multitude. It
<PB N="47" REF="48">
is not ea&s;y to &s;tate for what good end, at a time like this, when the foundations of all antient and pre|&s;umptive governments &s;uch as ours (to which peo|ple &s;ubmit, not becau&s;e they have cho&s;en them, but but becau&s;e they are born to them) are undermined by perilous theories, that Mr. Fox &s;hould be &s;o fond of referring to tho&s;e theories, upon all occa|&s;ions, even tho' &s;peculatively they might be true, which God forbid they &s;hould! Particularly I do not &s;ee the rea&s;on why he &s;hould be &s;o fond of de|claring, that the principles of the Revolution have made the Crown of Great Britain <HI>elective</HI>; why he thinks it &s;ea&s;onable to preach up with &s;o much ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, for now three years together, the doctrine of re&s;i&s;tance and Revolution at all; or to a&s;&s;ert that our la&s;t Revolution of 1688 &s;tands on the &s;ame and &s;imilar principles with that of France. We are not called upon to bring forward the&s;e doctrines, which are hardly ever re&s;orted to but in ca&s;es of extremi|ty, and where they are followed by corre&s;pondent actions. We are not called upon by any circum|&s;tance, that I know of, which can ju&s;tify a revolt, or which demands a Revolution, or can make an election of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the Crown nece&s;&s;ary, what|ever latent right may be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t for effec|tuating any of the&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P N="40">40. Not the lea&s;t alarming of the proceedings of Mr. Fox and his friends in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially taken in concurrence with their whole proceedings, with regard to France and its principles, is their eagerne&s;s at this &s;ea&s;on, under pretence of Parlia|mentary Reform (a project which had been for &s;ome time rather dormant) to di&s;credit and di&s;grace the Hou&s;e of Commons. For this purpo&s;e the&s;e Gen|tlemen have found a way to in&s;ult the Hou&s;e by &s;e|veral atrocious libels in the form of petitions. In particular they brought up a libel, or rather a com|plete

Among the circum&s;tances of danger from that piece and from its precedent, it is ob&s;ervable, that this is the fir&s;t petition (if I remember right) <HI>coming from a Club or a&s;&s;ociation, &s;igned by individuals, de|noting neither local re&s;idence, nor corporate capacity.</HI> This mode of petition not being &s;trictly illegal or informal, tho' in its &s;pirit in the highe&s;t degree mi&s;|chievous, may and will lead to other things of that nature, tending to bring the&s;e Clubs and A&s;&s;ocia|tions to the French model, and to make them in the end an&s;wer French purpo&s;es: I mean, that without legal names, the&s;e Clubs will be lead to a&s;&s;ume po|litical capacities; that they may debate the forms of Con&s;titution; and that from their meetings they may in&s;olently dictate their will to the regular autho|rities of the kingdom, in the manner in which the Jacobin Clubs i&s;&s;ue their mandates to the National A&s;&s;embly or the National Convention. The auda|cious remon&s;trance, which I ob&s;erve is &s;igned by all of that A&s;&s;ociation (the Friends of the People) <HI>who are not in Parliament,</HI> and it was &s;upported mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly by all a&s;&s;ociations <HI>who are members,</HI> with Mr. Fox at their head. He and they contended for referring this libel to a Committee. Upon the que&s;tion of that reference, they grounded all their debate for a change in the con&s;titution of Parliament. The pretended Petition is, in fact, a regular charge or impeachment of the Hou&s;e of Commons, dige&s;t|ed into a number of articles. This plan of Reform
<PB N="49" REF="50">
is not a criminal impeachment, but a matter of prudence, to be &s;ubmitted to the public wi&s;dom, which mu&s;t be as well apprized of the facts as peti|tioners can be. But tho&s;e acce&s;&s;ors of the Hou&s;e of Commons have proceeded upon the principles of a criminal proce&s;s; and have had the effrontery to offer proof on each article.</P>
<P N="42">42. This charge, the party of Mr. Fox main|tained article by article, beginning with the fir&s;t, namely, the interference of Peers at elections, and their nominating in effect &s;everal Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons. In the printed li&s;t of grievan|ces which they made out on the occa&s;ion, and in &s;upport of their charge, is found in the borough, which under Lord Fitzwilliam's influence, I now &s;it. By this remon&s;trance and its object, they hope to defeat the operation of property in electi|ons, and in reality to di&s;&s;olve the connection and communication of intere&s;ts which makes the Hou&s;es of Parliament a mutual &s;upport to each other. Mr. Fox and the friends of the people are not &s;o igno|rant as not to know, that Peers do not interfere in elections as Peers, but as men of property. They well know that the Hou&s;e of Lords is by it&s;elf the feeble&s;t part of the con&s;titution; they know that the Hou&s;e of Lords is &s;upported only by its connecti|ons with the crown and the Hou&s;e of Commons; and that without this double connection the Lords could not exi&s;t a &s;ingle year. They know, that all the&s;e parts of our con&s;titution, whil&s;t they are ba|lanced as oppo&s;ing intere&s;ts, are al&s;o connected as friends; otherwi&s;e nothing but confu&s;ion could be the re&s;ult of a complex con&s;titution. It is natu|ral, therefore, that they who wi&s;h the com|mon de&s;truction of the whole and of all its parts, &s;hould contend for their total &s;eparation. But as the Hou&s;e of Commons is that link which connects
<PB N="50" REF="51">
both the other parts of the con&s;titution (the Crown and the Lords) <HI>with the ma&s;s of the people,</HI> it is to that link (as it is natural enough) that their ince&s;&s;ant attacks are directed. That artificial repre&s;entation of the people being once di&s;credited and overturn|ed, all goes to pieces, and nothing but a plain <HI>French</HI> democracy or arbitrary monarchs can po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t.</P>
<P N="43">43. Some of the&s;e gentlemen who have attacked the Hou&s;e of Commons, lean to a repre&s;entation of the people by the head, that is, to <HI>individual repre|&s;entation.</HI> None of them that I recollect, except Mr. Fox, directly rejected it. It is remarkable, however, that he only rejected it by &s;imply declar|ing an opinion. He let all the argument go again&s;t his opinion. All the proceedings and arguments of his reforming friends lead to individual repre|&s;entation and to nothing el&s;e. It de&s;erves to be at|tentively ob&s;erved, <HI>that his individual repre&s;entation is the only plan of their reform, which has been expli|citly propo&s;ed.</HI> In the mean time, the conduct of Mr. Fox appears to be far more inexplicable, on any good ground, than theirs, who propo&s;e the individual repre&s;entation; for he neither propo&s;es any thing, nor even &s;ugge&s;ts that he has any thing to propo&s;e, in lieu of the pre&s;ent mode of con&s;ti|tuting the Hou&s;e of Commons.&mdash;On the contrary, he declares again&s;t all the plans which have yet been &s;ugge&s;ted, either from him&s;elf or others: yet, thus unprovided with any plan what&s;oever, he pre&s;&s;ed forward this unknown reform with all po&s;&s;ible warmth; and for that purpo&s;e, in a &s;peech of &s;eve|ral hours, he urged the referring to a committee, the libellous impeachment of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons by the a&s;&s;ociation of the friends of the peo|ple. But for Mr. Fox to di&s;credit Parliament <HI>as it &s;tands,</HI>&mdash;to countenance leagues, covenants, and
<PB N="51" REF="52">
a&s;&s;ociations for its further di&s;credit,&mdash;to render it perfectly odious and contemptible,&mdash;and at the &s;ame time to propo&s;e nothing at all in place of what he di&s;graces, (is wor&s;e if po&s;&s;ible) than to contend for per&s;onal individual repre&s;entation, and is little le&s;s than demanding, in plain terms, to bring on plain anarchy.</P>
<P N="44">44. Mr. Fox and the&s;e gentlemen have, for the pre&s;ent, been defeated; but they are neither con|verted nor di&s;heartened. They have &s;o &s;olemnly de|clared, that they will per&s;evere until they have ob|tained their ends; per&s;i&s;ting to a&s;&s;ert, that the Hou&s;e of Commons not only is not a true repre&s;en|tative of the people, but that it does not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of &s;uch repre&s;entation; mo&s;t of them in&s;i&s;t that all the debts, the taxes, and the burthens of all kinds on the people, with every other evil and in|convenience, which we have &s;uffered &s;ince the re|volution, have been owing &s;olely to the Hou&s;e of Commons which does not &s;peak the &s;en&s;e of the people.</P>
<P N="45">45. It is al&s;o not to be forgotten, that Mr. Fox, and all who hold with him, on this, as on all other occa&s;ions of pretended Reform, mo&s;t bitterly re|proached Mr. Pitt with treachery, in declining to &s;upport the &s;candalous charges and indefinite pro|jects of this infamous libel from the friends of the people. By the animo&s;ity with which they per&s;e|cute all tho&s;e who grow cold in this cau&s;e of pre|tended Reform, they hope, that if through levity, inexperience, or ambition, any young per&s;on (like Mr. Pitt, for in&s;tance) happens to be once em|barked in their de&s;ign, they &s;hall, by a fal&s;e &s;hame, keep him fa&s;t in it for ever. Many they have &s;o hampered.</P>
<P N="46"><PB N="52" REF="53">46. I know it is u&s;ual, when the peril and alarm of the hour appears to be a little overblown; to think no more of the matter.&mdash;But for my part, I look back with horror on what we have e&s;caped; and am full of anxiety with regard to the dangers, that, in my opinion, are &s;till to be ap|prehended both at home and abroad; this bu&s;ine&s;s has ca&s;t deep roots. Whether it is nece&s;&s;arily connected in theory with Jacobini&s;m is not worth a di&s;pute. The two things are connected in fact. The partizans of the one are the partizans of the other. I know it is common with tho&s;e who are favourable to the gentlemen of Mr. Fox's party, and to their leader, though not at all devoted to all their reforming projects, or their Gallican po|litics, to argue in palliation of their conduct, that it is not in their power to do all the harm their actions evidently tend to. It is &s;aid, that as the people will not &s;upport them, they may &s;afely be indulged in tho&s;e eccentric fancies of Reform, and tho&s;e theories which lead to nothing. This apo|logy is not very much to the honour of tho&s;e po|liticians, who&s;e intere&s;ts are to be adhered to in defiance of their conduct. I cannot flatter my&s;elf that the&s;e ince&s;&s;ant attacks on the con&s;titution of of Parliament are &s;afe. It is not in my power to de&s;pi&s;e the uncea&s;ing efforts of a confederacy of about fifty per&s;ons of eminence; men of the far greater part, of very ample fortunes either in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion or in expectancy; men of decided characters and vehement pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;men of very great talents of all kinds; of much boldne&s;s, and of the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;pirit of artifice, intrigue, adventure and enterprize, all operating with unwearied activity and per&s;everence. The&s;e gentlemen, are much &s;tronger too without doors than &s;ome calculate. They have the more active part of the Di&s;&s;enters with them; and the whole clan of &s;peculators of all denomina|tions
<PB N="53" REF="54">
&mdash;a large and growing &s;pecies. They have that floating multitude which goes with events and which &s;uffer the lo&s;s or gain of a battle, to decide their opi|nions of right and wrong. As long as by every art this party keeps alive a &s;pirit of di&s;affection again&s;t the very Con&s;titution of the kingdom, and attri|butes, as lately it has been in the habit of doing, all the public misfortunes to that Con&s;titution it is ab|&s;olutely <HI>impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> but that &s;ome moment mu&s;t arrive, in which they will be enabled to produce a pretended Reform and a real Revolution. If ever the body of this <HI>compound Con&s;titution</HI> of ours is &s;ubverted either in favour of unlimited Monarchy, or of wild Democracy, that ruin will <HI>mo&s;t certainly</HI> be the re&s;ult of this very &s;ort of machinations again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Commons. It is not from a confidence in the views or intentions of any &s;tate&s;man that I think he is to be indulged in the&s;e perilous amu&s;e|ments.</P>
<P N="47">47. Before it is made the great object of any man's political life to rai&s;e another to power, it is right to con&s;ider what are the real di&s;po&s;itions of the per&s;on to be &s;o elevated. We are not to form our judgment on the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions from the rules and principles of a court of Ju&s;tice, but from tho&s;e of private di&s;cretion; not looking for what would &s;erve to criminate another, but what is &s;uf|ficient to direct our&s;elves.&mdash;By a compari&s;on of a &s;eries of the di&s;cour&s;es and actions of certain men, for a rea&s;onable length of time, it is im|po&s;&s;ible not to obtain &s;ufficient indication of the general tendency of their views and principles. There is no other rational mode of proceeding. It is true, that in &s;ome one or two, perhaps not well weighed expre&s;&s;ions, or &s;ome one or two un|connected and doubtful affairs, we may and ought to judge of the actions or words by our previous
<PB N="54" REF="55">
good or ill opinion of the man. But this allow|ance has its bounds. It does not extend to any regular cour&s;e of &s;y&s;tematic action, or of con&s;tant and repeated di&s;cour&s;e. It is again&s;t every prin|ciple of common &s;en&s;e and of ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, and to the public, to judge of a &s;eries of &s;peeches and actions from the man, and not of the man from the whole tenor of his language and con|duct. Had Mr. Fox been a mini&s;ter, and pro|ceeded in that capacity on the principles and in the manner in which he has acted during the whole of the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, I believe he would be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t criminal &s;tate&s;man that ever exi&s;ted in this country. I do not &s;ee why a &s;tate&s;man out of place is not to be judged of in the &s;ame manner, unle&s;s we excu&s;e him by plead|ing in his favor a total indifference to moral prin|ciple, and that he would &s;peak and act in quite a different way, if he were in office. I have &s;tated the above matters, not as infering a criminal charge of evil intention. If I had meant to do &s;o, perhaps they are &s;tated with tolerable exact|ne&s;s&mdash;But I have no &s;uch view. The intentions of the&s;e Gentlemen may be very pure. I do not di&s;pute it. But I think they are in &s;ome great error. If the&s;e things are done by Mr. Fox and his friends, with good intentions, they are not done le&s;s dangerou&s;ly; for it &s;hews the&s;e good in|tentions are not under the direction of &s;afe max|ims and principles.</P>
<P N="48">48. Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, and the Gentle|men who call them&s;elves the phalanx, have not been &s;o very indulgent to others. They have thought proper to a&s;cribe to tho&s;e Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, who, in exact agreement with the Duke of Portland, and Lord Fitzwilliam, abhor and oppo&s;e the French &s;y&s;tem, the ba&s;e&s;t
<PB N="55" REF="56">
and mo&s;t unworthy motives for their conduct;&mdash;as if none could oppo&s;e that athei&s;tic, immoral and impolitic project &s;et up in France, &s;o di&s;|graceful and de&s;tructive, as I conceive, to human nature it&s;elf, but with &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter intentions. They treat tho&s;e Members on all occa&s;ions with a &s;ort of lordly in&s;olence, though they are per&s;ons that (whatever homage they may pay to the elo|quence of the Gentlemen who choo&s;e to look down upon them with &s;corn,) are not their in|feriors in any particular which calls for and ob|tains ju&s;t con&s;ideration from the public&mdash;not their inferiors on knowledge of public law, or of the Con&s;titution of the kingdom&mdash;not their inferiors in their acquaintance with its foreign and dome&s;tic intere&s;ts&mdash;not their inferiors in experience or practice of bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;not their inferiors in moral character&mdash;nor their inferiors in the proofs they have given of zeal and indu&s;try in the &s;ervice of their country. Without denying to the&s;e Gentle|men, the re&s;pect and con&s;ideration which, it is allowed, ju&s;tly belongs to them, we &s;ee no rea&s;on why they &s;hould not as well be obliged to concede &s;omething to our opinions, as that we &s;hould be bound blindly and &s;ervilely to follow tho&s;e of Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Grey, Mr. Court|ney, Mr. Lambton, Mr. Whitbread, Mr. Francis, Mr. Taylor, and others. We are Members of Parliament and their equals. We never con&s;ider our&s;elves as their followers. The&s;e Gentlemen (&s;ome of them hardly born, when &s;ome of us came into Parliament) have thought proper to treat us as de&s;erters, as if we had been li&s;ted into their phalanx like &s;oldiers, and had &s;worn to live and die in their French principles. This in&s;olent claim of &s;uperiority on their part, and of a &s;ort of va&s;|&s;alage to them on that of other Members, is what no liberal mind will &s;ubmit to.</P>

<P N="49"><PB N="56" REF="59">49. The Society of the Liberty of the Pre&s;s, the Whig Club, and the Society for Con&s;titutional Information, and (I believe) the Friends of the People, as well as &s;ome Clubs in Scotland, have indeed declared,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That their confidence in and attachment to Mr. Fox, has lately been con|firmed, &s;trengthened, and encrea&s;ed by the ca|lumnies (as they are called) again&s;t him."</Q>
It is true, Mr. Fox and his friends have tho&s;e te&s;ti|monies in their favour, again&s;t certain old friends of the Duke of Portland. Yet on a full, &s;erious, and I think di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate con&s;ideration of the whole of what Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan and their friends have acted, &s;aid and written, in this Se&s;&s;ion, in&s;tead of doing any thing which might tend to procure power, or any &s;hare of it what|&s;oever, to them or to their phalanx (as they call it) or to encrea&s;e their credit, influence, or popu|larity in the nation, I think it one of my mo&s;t &s;erious and important public duties, in what&s;oever &s;tation I may be placed for the &s;hort time I have to live, effectually to employ my be&s;t endeavours, by every prudent and every lawful means, to tra|ver&s;e all their de&s;igns. I have only to lament, that my abilities are not greater, and that my proba|bility of life is not better, for the more effectual pur&s;uit of that object. But I tru&s;t, that neither the principles nor exertions will die with me. I am the rather confirmed in this my re&s;olution, and in this my wi&s;h of tran&s;mitting it, becau&s;e every ray of hope concerning a po&s;&s;ible control or mitigation of the enormous mi&s;chiefs which the principles of the&s;e Gentlemen, and which their connections full as dangerous as their prin|ciples, might receive from the influence of the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam, on be|coming their colleagues in office, is now entirely bani&s;hed from the mind of every man living.&mdash;
<PB N="57" REF="60">
It is apparent, even to the world at large, that &s;o far from having a power to direct or to guide Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Grey, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. in any important matter, they have not, through this Se&s;&s;ion, been able to prevail on them to forbear or to delay, or mitigate, or &s;often any one act, or any one expre&s;&s;ion upon &s;ubjects on which they e&s;&s;entially differed.</P>
<P N="50">50. Even if this hope of a po&s;&s;ible control did exi&s;t, yet the declared opinions and the uniform line of conduct conformable to tho&s;e opinions, pur&s;ued by Mr. Fox, mu&s;t become a matter of &s;erious alarm if he &s;hould obtain a power either at Court or in Parliament, or in the Nation at large; and for this plain rea&s;on&mdash;He mu&s;t be the mo&s;t active and efficient member in any Ad|mini&s;tration of which he &s;hall form a part. That a man, or &s;et of men, are guided by &s;uch not du|bious, but delivered and avowed principles and maxims of policy as to need a watch and check on them, in the exerci&s;e of the highe&s;t power, ought in my opinion, to make every man, who is not of the &s;ame principles, and guided by the &s;ame maxims, a little cautious how he makes him|&s;elf one of the traver&s;ers of a ladder, to help &s;uch a man or &s;uch a &s;et of men, to climb up to the highe&s;t authority. A mini&s;ter of this country is to be controlled by the Hou&s;e of Commons. He is to be tru&s;ted, not <HI>controlled,</HI> by his col|leagues in office; if he were to be controlled, Government, which ought to be the &s;ource of order, would it&s;elf become a &s;cene of anarchy. Be&s;ides, Mr. Fox is a man of an a&s;piring and commanding mind, made rather to control, than to be controlled, and he never will be, nor can be, in any Admini&s;tration, in which he will be guided by any of tho&s;e whom I have been accu&s;|tomed
<PB N="58" REF="61">
to confide in. It is ab&s;urd to think that he would or could. If his own opinions do not control him, nothing can. When we con&s;ider of an adherence to a man which leads to his power, we mu&s;t not only &s;ee what the man is, but how he &s;tands related.</P>
<P>It is not to be forgotten that Mr. Fox acts in clo&s;e and in&s;eparable connection with another Gentleman of exactly the &s;ame de&s;cription as him&s;elf, and who, perhaps, of the two, is the leader. The re&s;t of the body are not a great deal more tractable; and over them if Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan have authority, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly the Duke of Portland has not the &s;malle&s;t degree of influence.</P>
<P N="51">51. One mu&s;t take care, that a blind partiality to &s;ome per&s;ons, and as blind an hatred to others, may not enter into our minds under a colour of inflexible public principle. We hear, as a rea&s;on for clinging to Mr. Fox at pre&s;ent, that nine years ago Mr. Pitt got into power by mi&s;chievous in|trigues with the Court, with the Di&s;&s;enters, and with other factious people out of Parliament, to the di&s;credit and weakening of the power of the Hou&s;e of Commons. His conduct nine years ago I &s;till hold to be very culpable. There are, however, many things very culpable that I do not know how to puni&s;h. My opinion, on &s;uch matters, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the good of the State, as I have done on other occa&s;ions; and particularly with regard to the authors and managers of the American war, with whom I have acted, both in office and in oppo&s;ition, with great confidence and cordiality, though I thought many of their acts criminal and impeach|able. Whil&s;t the mi&s;conduct of Mr. Pitt and his a&s;&s;ociates was yet recent, it was not po&s;&s;ible to get
<PB N="59" REF="62">
Mr. Fox of him&s;elf to take a &s;ingle &s;tep, or even to countenance others in taking any &s;tep upon the ground of that mi&s;conduct and fal&s;e policy, though if the matters had been then taken up and pur&s;ued, &s;uch a &s;tep could not have appeared &s;o evidently de&s;|perate as now it is.&mdash;So far from pur&s;uing Mr. Pitt, I know that then, and for &s;ome time after, &s;ome of Mr. Fox's friends were actually, and with no &s;mall earne&s;tne&s;s, looking out to a coalition with that gen|tleman. For years I never heard this circum&s;tance of Mr. Pitt's mi&s;conduct on that occa&s;ion mentioned by Mr. Fox, either in public or in private, as a ground for oppo&s;ition to that mini&s;ter. All oppo|&s;ition, from that period to this very Se&s;&s;ion, has pro|ceeded upon the &s;eparate mea&s;ures as they &s;eparately aro&s;e, without any vindictive retro&s;pect to Mr. Pitt's conduct in 1784. My memory, however, may fail me. I mu&s;t appeal to the printed debates, which (&s;o far as Mr. Fox is concerned) are unu&s;ually ac|curate.</P>
<P N="52">52. Whatever might be in our power, at an early period, at this day I &s;ee no remedy for what was done in 1784. I had no great hopes even at that time, I was therefore very eager to record a remon|&s;trance on the journals of the Hou&s;e of Commons, as a caution again&s;t &s;uch a popular delu&s;ion in times to come; and this I then feared, and now am cer|tain, is all that could be done. I know of no way of animadverting on the Crown. I know no mode of calling to account the Hou&s;e of Lords, who threw out the India Bill, in a way not much to their credit.</P>
<P>As little, or rather le&s;s, am I able to coerce the people at large, who behaved very unwi&s;ely and intemperately on that occa&s;ion. Mr. Pitt was then accu&s;ed, by me as well as others, of attempting to be mini&s;ter, without enjoying the confidence of the
<PB N="60" REF="63">
Hou&s;e of Commons, though he did enjoy the confi|dence of the Crown. That Hou&s;e of Commons, who&s;e confidence he did not enjoy, unfortunately did not it&s;elf enjoy the confidence, (though we well de&s;erved it) either of the Crown or of the pub|lic. For want of that confidence, the then Hou&s;e of Commons did not &s;urvive the conte&s;t. Since that period Mr. Pitt has enjoyed the confidence of the Crown, and of the Lords, and <HI>of the Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> through two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Parliaments; and I &s;u&s;pect that he has ever &s;ince, and that he does &s;till, enjoy as large a portion, at lea&s;t, of the confi|dence of the people without doors, as his great rival. <HI>Before</HI> whom, then, is Mr. Pitt to be im|peached, and by whom? the more I con&s;ider the matter, the more firmly I am convinced, that the idea of pro&s;cribing Mr. Pitt <HI>indirectly,</HI> when you cannot <HI>directly puni&s;h</HI> him is a chimerical a pro|ject, and as unju&s;tifiable, as it would be to have pre&s;cribed Lord North. For &s;uppo&s;ing, that by indirect ways of oppo&s;ition, by oppo&s;ition upon mea&s;ures which do not relate to the bu&s;ine&s;s of 1784, but which on other grounds might prove un|popular, you were to drive him from his &s;eat, this would be no example whatever of puni&s;hment for the matters we charge as offences in 1784. On a cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate view of the affairs of this time and country, it appears obvious to me, that one or the other of the&s;e two great men, that is, Mr. Pitt or Mr. Fox, mu&s;t be Mini&s;ter. They are, I am &s;orry for it, irreconcileable. Mr. Fox's con|duct <HI>in this Se&s;&s;ion</HI> has rendered the idea of his power a matter of &s;erious alarm to many people, who were very little plea&s;ed with the proceedings of Mr. Pitt in the beginning of his admini&s;tration. They like neither the conduct of Mr. Pitt in 1784, nor that of Mr. Fox in 1793; but they e&s;timate, which of the evils is mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing at the time, and
<PB N="61" REF="64">
what is likely to be the con&s;equence of a change. If Mr. Fox be wedded, they mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that his opinions and principles, on the now exi&s;ting &s;tate of things at home and abroad, mu&s;t be taken as his portion. In his train mu&s;t al&s;o be taken the whole body of gentlemen, who are pledged to him and to each other, and to their common politics and principles.&mdash;I believe no King of Great Bri|tain ever will adopt for his confidential &s;ervants, that body of gentlemen, holding that body of prin|ciples. Even if the pre&s;ent King or his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould think fit to take that &s;tep, I apprehend a general di&s;content of tho&s;e, who wi&s;h that this na|tion and that Europe &s;hould continue in their pre|&s;ent &s;tate, would en&s;ue; a di&s;content, which, com|bined with the principles and progre&s;s of the new men in power, would &s;hake this kingdom to its foundations. I do not believe any one political conjecture can be more certain than this.</P>
<P N="53">53. Without at all defending or palliating Mr. Pitt's conduct in 1784, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the cri&s;is of 1793, with regard to every thing at home and abroad, is full as important as that of 1784 ever was; and, if for no other rea&s;on, by being pre&s;ent, is much more important. It is not to nine years ago we are to look for the danger of Mr. Fox's and Mr. Sheridan's conduct, and that of the Gen|tlemen who act with them.</P>
<P>It is at <HI>this</HI> very time, and in <HI>this</HI> very &s;e&s;&s;i|on, that, if they had not been &s;trenuou&s;ly re&s;i&s;ted, they would not only merely have di&s;credited the Hou&s;e of Commons (as Mr. Pitt did in 1784, when he per&s;uaded the King to reject their advice, and to appeal from them to the people,) but, in my opinion, would have been the means of wholly &s;ubverting the Hou&s;e of Commons and the Hou&s;e of Peers, and the whole Con&s;titution actual and vertual, together with the &s;afety and independence

of this nation, and of the peace and &s;ettlement of every &s;tate in the now Chri&s;tian world. It is to our opinion of the nature of Jacobini&s;m, and of the probability by corruption, faction, and force, of its gaining ground every where, that the que&s;ti|on who and what are you to &s;upport is to be deter|mined. For my part, without doubt or he&s;itation, I look upon Jacobini&s;m as the mo&s;t dreadful, and mo&s;t &s;hameful evil, which ever afflicted mankind, a &s;ting which goes beyond the power of all calcu|lation in its mi&s;chief; and that if it is &s;uffered to exi&s;t in France, we mu&s;t in England, and &s;peedily too, fall into that calamity.</P>
<P N="54">54. I figure to my&s;elf the purpo&s;e of the&s;e Gen|tlemen accompli&s;hed, and this Mini&s;try de&s;troyed. I &s;ee that the per&s;ons who in that ca&s;e mu&s;t rule, can be no other than Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Grey, the Marquis of Lan&s;downe, Lord Thurlow, Lord Lauderdale, and the Duke of Norfolk, with the other Chiefs of the Friends of the People, the Parliamentary Reformers, and the admirers of the French Revolution. The principal of the&s;e are all formally pledged to their projects. If the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam &s;hould be admit|ted into that &s;y&s;tem (as they might and probably would be) it is quite certain they could not have the &s;malle&s;t weight in it; le&s;s, indeed, than what they now profe&s;s, if le&s;s were po&s;&s;ible: becau&s;e they would be le&s;s wanted than they now are; and be|cau&s;e all tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to join them, and to act under them, have been rejected by the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam them&s;elves; and Mr. Fox, finding them thus by them&s;elves di&s;arm|ed, has built quite a new fabric, upon quite a new foundation. There is no trifling on this &s;ubject. We &s;ee very di&s;tinctly before us the Mini&s;try that would be formed, and the plan that would be pur|&s;ued. If we like the plan, we mu&s;t wi&s;h the pow|er
<PB N="63" REF="66">
of tho&s;e who are to carry it into execution; but to pur&s;ue the political exaltation of tho&s;e who&s;e political mea&s;ures we di&s;approve, and who&s;e principles we di&s;&s;ent from, is a &s;pecies of modern politics not ea|&s;ily comprehen&s;ible, and which mu&s;t end in the ruin of the Country, if it &s;hould continue and &s;pread. Mr. Pitt may be the wor&s;t of men, and Mr. Fox may be the be&s;t, but at pre&s;ent, the former is in the intere&s;t of his country, and of the order of things long e&s;tabli&s;hed in Europe: Mr. Fox is not. I have, for one, been born in this order of things, and would fain die in it. I am &s;ure it is &s;ufficient to make men as virtuous, as happy, and as know|ing as any thing which Mr. Fox and his friends abroad or at home, would &s;ub&s;titute in its place; and I &s;hould be &s;orry that any &s;et of politicians &s;hould obtain power in England, who&s;e principles, or &s;chemes &s;hould lead them to countenance per&s;ons or factions who&s;e object is to introduce &s;ome new devi&s;ed order of things into England, or to &s;upport that order where it is already introduced in France; a place, in which if it can be fixed, in my mind, it mu&s;t have a certain and decided influence in and upon this kingdom. This is my account of my conduct to my private friends. I have already &s;aid all I wi&s;h to &s;ay, or nearly &s;o, to the public, I write this with pain, and with an heart full of grief!</P>
