<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following hi&s;torical
E&s;&s;ays were written as a
Sequel to one bearing the &s;ame
Title, publi&s;hed &s;ome time
&s;ince in the <HI>Craft&s;man,</HI> and
communicated to that Author;
but he having neglected to give
them to the Publick, I have
thought fit to become the Edi|tor
my&s;elf. Whether Mr. <HI>d'
Anvers</HI> e&s;teems other Subjects
more &s;ea&s;onable at this time;
whether he has been intimida|ted
with Pro&s;ecutions, or &s;of|ten'd
with Applications, I do
not take upon me to determine.
<PB REF="4">
I have the Plea&s;ure only to a&s;|&s;ure
the Reader, that I have
faithfully collected the Facts
that are related in the&s;e little
Tracts, as they have fallen out
from time to time, and &s;hall
continue to have a watchful
Eye over the Actions of our
Steward, and to record them
for the Benefit of Po&s;terity, that
tho&s;e who come after us at
lea&s;t may be deterr'd by this
Example, from intru&s;ting the
Management of their E&s;tates
to bad Hands. The Memoria|li&s;t
furni&s;hes Materials for the
Hi&s;torian, and &s;o far he has a
right to &s;hare in his Fame. Per|haps
the Character of this mo&s;t
remarkable Steward may, by
my means, be pre&s;erved thus to
<PB REF="5">
future Times; the Indulgence
of this Vanity, and the Con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s
of having done what
was in my Power to expo&s;e a
corrupt Servant, is all the Re|ward
I claim; as a Man has
&s;ome little Pretence to Merit
from the Publick, who only
crys out, <HI>Stop Thief.</HI></P>
<P>But before I take leave of my
Readers, I humbly intreat, as
they de&s;ire to be thought can|did,
or courteous, or to be o|bliged
with any other Epithets,
that the mo&s;t complai&s;ant Wri|ter
ever gave them, That they
will be &s;o good not to force the
Letters in the following Pages,
to convey to them any other
Meanings than what they &s;tand
<PB REF="6">
for in the Order they are there
placed, it being the Nature of
the Twenty-four Letters in our
Alphabet, as I am inform'd,
when they are tran&s;po&s;ed, to
give to the Reader what Ideas
the Tran&s;po&s;er plea&s;es; &s;o
large is the Field of Innuen|do's:
This Caution might per|haps
at any other Time or
Place than this appear ridicu|lous;
but as &s;ome People are
very tender, and others very
cen&s;orious, I thought this not
an unnece&s;&s;ary Adverti&s;ement.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I HAVE the Happiness to be
Tenant to Sir <HI>George Engli&s;h,</HI>
and there is not one among
them who has a more hearty
Affection for him and his
whole Family, than I have. When this Estate
(which he now enjoys, and which, Hea|ven
grant, he and his may long enjoy) was
fir&s;t left to him, by the general Attorn|ment
of the Tenants, and the Con&s;ent
and Act of brave Sir <HI>William,</HI> his An|ce&s;tor,
<PB N="2" REF="8">
I had the plea&s;ure, as a Witne&s;s and
a Tenant, to &s;ign the In&s;trument my
&s;elf: I &s;aw good Sir <HI>William</HI> ratify it, I be|held
him &s;oon after expire, and could
di&s;cern a plea&s;ing Satisfaction in his Fea|tures,
ri&s;ing from the Comfort he received
in having fini&s;hed what he believed mu&s;t
make his Tenants the happie&s;t and mo&s;t
ea&s;y of any People in our whole County.
You will forgive me, Sir, that I thus
dwell on the Prai&s;e of my good old
Ma&s;ter Sir <HI>William:</HI> He was a Man who
loved his whole Species, who had a ge|neral
Benevolence to Mankind; he did
not think any Man was born for him&s;elf
alone, nor could he bear to &s;ee any of his
neighbouring Landlords u&s;e their Te|nants
ill, or rack them too high; and more
than once he has engaged him&s;elf in ex|pen&s;ive
Law-&s;uits, to deliver them from
the Hands of the Oppre&s;&s;or. Mr. <HI>Lyn,</HI>
of whom I now complain to you, Sir,
was one of the Tenants; and tho' his lit|tle
Copy-hold was then not much in re|pair,
and a little incumbered with Debts,
however it has been &s;ince improved, he
<PB N="3" REF="9">
profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf very zealous, as well as
the re&s;t of us, in the Intere&s;t of our Land|lord,
and continued &s;o &s;ome Years: But
Time proves every thing; and a very lit|tle
while after he was appointed Steward
to our old Ma&s;ter, he began to &s;hew
him&s;elf; and tho' the Affairs of Sir <HI>George</HI>
grew every day wor&s;e and wor&s;e under
his Management, the Affairs of Mr.
<HI>Lyn</HI> grew better and better every day.
He began to look plump and round; his
little Farm was clear of all Incum|brances;
his Family, his Friends, his
Relations, his Acquaintance, all grew
plump likewi&s;e, and flouri&s;hed under his
Influence: He had indeed been very libe|ral
to them, not out of his own Money,
but his Ma&s;ter's; He put them into all
the Employments he could find in the
&s;everal Manors, and very frequently,
when there was no Employment rea|dy,
or open, or unenjoy'd by any Re|lation,
Friend, or Dependent of his, he
was ready to erect an Office, and to
give it a Name and an Appointment out
of his Ma&s;ter's Rents, without any Con|&s;ideration
<PB N="4" REF="10">
how much his Ma&s;ter was in
debt, how detrimental it mu&s;t prove to
his E&s;tate, or how ungrateful it was to
the Tenants, who &s;aw, and murmured to
&s;ee, that their Farms were racked to the
highe&s;t, to &s;upport the Family, and
other Self-Interests of Mr. <HI>Lyn.</HI> Well,
Sir, our Steward grew rich, he grew am|bitious
and vain, and haughty, and
humorous; and now took it into his
Head, that he was as accompli&s;h'd a
Gentleman even as Sir <HI>George</HI> him&s;elf,
and would needs be &s;tiled his <HI>Compa|nion:</HI>
He dre&s;s'd him&s;elf up in Blue,
and u&s;ed to &s;trut about in Pearl Co|lour
Stockings, a Silk Doublet, and a
Cap and Feather, and fancy'd he had
enrolled him&s;elf among Heroes and
Gods, &s;o hard it is for a Man in
Pro&s;perity to check the Folly of a vain
Mind; &s;ome time before this whim
of bedecking him&s;elf in Taffaty and
Blue, he had a Fancy to appear in
Red; and accordingly one Morning
with a very &s;olemn and grave Counte+nance,
he told &s;everal of his Intimate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="5" REF="11">
that now he was grown rich, he was re&s;ol|ved
to devote him&s;elf to the Service of
Religion, as a Knight-Errant; that he
would re&s;cue Virgins, protect Orphans,
de&s;troy Giants, and do every thing prai&s;e-worthy,
and becoming the great Office of
true Chivalry; he exhorted his Friends
likewi&s;e, who were very hone&s;t Men,
and meant well, to do the &s;ame, and told
them their Habiliments ought to be all a|like.
viz. Red Taffaty, Spurs, Feathers,
Caps, Faulchions, &amp;c. So &s;aid, &s;o done,
they dre&s;s'd them&s;elves, they &s;wore on the
Evangeli&s;ts to be good and true Knights,
they march'd in an affected Stage-&s;trut
round the Town, and made a Shew in their
whim&s;ical Dre&s;&s;es that &s;et all the Pari&s;h in
a Gape. Now one wou'd imagine that
Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI> was about to make amends for all
his Mi&s;management, and that the World,
as it had been the wor&s;e for him, would
be the better too: But this was only a Joke
it &s;eems; for as &s;oon as ever he had per&s;uad|ed
his Companions to this, on a &s;udden he
whipt off his Red Taffaty Doublet, and
put on a blue one, as I have &s;aid, and
<PB N="6" REF="12">
called him&s;elf his Ma&s;ter's Fellow, to the
great Surprize of every one. But the&s;e
Frolicks, you will &s;ay, might only take
Birth from the jocund Levities of a Head
a little giddy with Pro&s;perity, the plai&s;om
Gaities, the <HI>dulce de&s;ipere</HI> of a Heart &s;wol|len
with Joy and Power. We will go on
then to con&s;ider him only in his Character
of Steward.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>LYN</HI> was no &s;ooner got into the
Steward&s;hip, but he with very great A&s;|&s;urance
told his Ma&s;ter, that none of his
Tenants had any hearty Affection for him,
but him&s;elf and his Sons, his Brother
<HI>Townly</HI> and his Sons, with their Rela|tions
and Intimates; that if it were not
for his and their Management, Sir <HI>George</HI>
would not be able to make any thing of
the E&s;tate. And <HI>I&s;aac Tombrel,</HI> a Re|lation
to a Relation of Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI>'s by
Marriage, had the A&s;&s;urance to affirm be|fore
young Squire <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
elde&s;t Son, at Dinner at the Man&s;ion
Hou&s;e in <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> that the Pre&s;er|vation
of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s whole E&s;tate
<PB N="7" REF="13">
was owing to Mr. <HI>Lyn;</HI> for which, and
other unmannerly and indecent Expre&s;|&s;ions,
he was rebuked, di&s;graced, and
&s;ent back into <HI>Norfolk.</HI> Indeed Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI>
u&s;ed frequently in publick to applaud
him&s;elf for his good Management of the
E&s;tate, and to pronounce him&s;elf with
great Authority, the only Man in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
who knew how to keep a Rental.
He went farther, and frequently declared
that was it not for him, and his great Art
and Skill, the Tenants would not pay their
Rents, that they would forget all Re&s;pect
and Duty to Sir <HI>George,</HI> or join with Squire
<HI>Wel&s;h</HI> in the Law-&s;uit again&s;t him. Tho'
Squire <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> and his Law-&s;uit and Prenten|&s;ions
were very low and de&s;pi&s;ed, and al|mo&s;t
forgot by every body; yet Mr.
<HI>Lyn</HI> always endeavour'd to make his court
to his Ma&s;ter, by a&s;&s;uring him, that &s;eve|ral
of his Tenants, tho&s;e I mean who held
the large&s;t Farms, and who&s;e Hearts were
always with Sir <HI>George,</HI> were &s;ecretly Fa|vourers
of the Preten&s;ions of Mr. <HI>Wel|&s;h;</HI>
this, Sir, indeed appears to me one of Mr.
<PB N="8" REF="14">
<HI>Lyn</HI>'s greate&s;t Iniquities, as I think a Pick-thank
in a Family is mo&s;t odious Character.
But he was re&s;olved to &s;upport his Power
at the Expence of every thing; and now
finding him&s;elf, as he imagin'd, at lea&s;t in
Tru&s;t and Confidence with his Ma&s;ter,
(which we his poor Tenants hope is not real|ly
the Ca&s;e) he rai&s;ed his Cre&s;t, and threw
out his natural Bronze. And as In&s;olence
is ever the Mark of a little Mind, tho'
con&s;cious to him&s;elf of more Crimes than
any Man but him&s;elf can di&s;cover, he
&s;lighted his Superiors and de&s;pi&s;ed his Op|ponents.
The Pari&s;h-Officers, the A&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors
and Collectors of the Land-Tax, the
Con&s;tables, Portreve, and Jurymen, were
all his Creatures, Relations, Dependents
or Subdependents, &s;uch who&s;e Corrup|tion
and Con&s;ciences he could depend up|on.
Thus furni&s;hed, thus guarded and
&s;upported, he ventur'd on, he levy'd Mo|ney
upon the Tenants on the mo&s;t ridicu|lous
Pretence: an old Bridge was to be re|paired,
a new one to be built, the Pari&s;h
wanted a Set of Bells, a new Pair of
Stocks mu&s;t be provided; he made them
<PB N="9" REF="15">
contribute to the keeping &s;everal Packs
of Hounds; and &s;ometimes Ma&s;ter <HI>Lyn</HI>
wou'd demand a round Sum of Money
for private U&s;es, and &s;uch as were by
no means proper to be known to the Te|nants.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>George</HI> has a Park where his Te|nants
have Time out of Mind been per|mitted
to recreate and refre&s;h at lei&s;ure
Hours, as often as they plea&s;ed; and
thro' this Park many of them are oblig'd
to pa&s;s every Day to their Grounds; Mr.
<HI>Lyn,</HI> who valued him&s;elf on his Genius for
rai&s;ing Money, order'd his own Man to
&s;tand before the Park-Gate, and levy a
Penny for the Pa&s;&s;age of every Man, when
Bu&s;ine&s;s or Diver&s;ions oblig'd him to pa&s;s
that way; and this too under the Pretence
of &s;etting up a pair of Gates only, tho' the
Money levy'd would new pale the whole
Park. And this I mention only to &s;hew
you how ready he is at Undertakings of
this kind.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="16">
HOWEVER, notwith&s;tanding all
the Di&s;couragements that the Tenants lay
under, they might have thriven even under
the Steward&s;hip of Mr. <HI>Lyn,</HI> if he had
not with the utmo&s;t Art and Application
laboured to prevent it. The two greate&s;t
and known Enemies to Indu&s;try and Trade,
are Luxury and Gaming: the&s;e he careful|ly
encouraged; and in order to this, he in|vited
the Tenants to a large Gaming-table
which had been erected indeed in another
<HI>Robinocracy,</HI> in the very middle of the
Market-Place. To this Gaming-table the
Tenants, when they had di&s;po&s;ed of their
Wooll, their Corn, &amp;c. all hurry'd; and
as there is in mo&s;t Men a Lu&s;t after inordi|dinate
Gain, many of them play'd, and
every Day left behind them the Labours of
their Indu&s;try. But Mr. <HI>Lyn,</HI> ever pro|vident
for him&s;elf, took care that this &s;hould
turn to his Advantage; for (tho' he never
appeared there him&s;elf) he always employ'd
a few faithful Confidents to play for him,
and allow'd them to &s;hare in &s;ome Parts of
the Spoil. It was always his Method when
<PB N="11" REF="17">
he play'd thus by Deputy, to u&s;e loaded
Dice, either high or low as he fancy'd; and
when &s;ome of the Tenants, who by dear
Experience were now grown very peery,
ob&s;erv'd Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI>'s Dice in play, they
would very artfully, as they imagin'd, &s;et
their Dice accordingly; that is, if they ob|&s;erved
Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI> u&s;ed high Dice, they &s;et
expecting them to run high, and &s;o low,
when they &s;aw his Dice run low; but when
the Stakes were deep enough to invite Mr.
<HI>Lyn</HI>'s Acceptance, they were always invi|&s;ibly
changed upon them; and he was by
this ingenious Artifice Ma&s;ter of Part of
the Property of the Tenants. And as of|ten
as he plea&s;ed, by this he ama&s;&s;ed Wealth,
by this means the Manufactures of our
Country are very much hurt, and our Trade
decrea&s;es. This is at pre&s;ent the Ca&s;e un|der
our mo&s;t righteous Steward; and they
tell me, there is nothing he delights in at
this Hour, &s;o much as Gaming by Proxy,
and Fox-Hunting.</P>

The HISTORY of the
NORFOLK STEWARD.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART II. Containing a farther Account of Mr. Lyn's
Management; and al&s;o of his Method of
Stating and Ballancing Accounts.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Believe my <HI>la&s;t</HI> hath convinc'd you that
Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI>'s management of Sir <HI>George</HI>'s
<HI>Dome&s;tick Affairs,</HI> was full as extraordina|ry
as that of his <HI>Law&s;uits</HI> with his <HI>Neigh|bours.</HI>
But perhaps you will wonder that
<PB N="14" REF="19">
he &s;hould be &s;uffer'd to go on &s;o long in
the&s;e Practices; that he hath not been con|&s;tantly
<HI>pre&s;ented</HI> every <HI>Court-day</HI> for &s;o ma|ny
repeated Mi&s;doings; or that even all the
<HI>Tenants</HI> of the <HI>Mannor</HI> do not unanimou&s;ly
make it their reque&s;t to Sir <HI>George</HI> (who&s;e
Ears are always open to their Complaints)
that he would be plea&s;ed to remove a Stew|ard
who&s;e Mananagement is generally di&s;|liked
and complained of by all the Tenants.
But your Surprize will vani&s;h when you
recollect what I have told you in both my
former Letters; that all the <HI>Prime Officers</HI>
both of the <HI>Pari&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Mannor,</HI> as well
as mo&s;t of the <HI>Jurymen,</HI> were his own <HI>Re|lations</HI>
or <HI>Creatures;</HI> that a great number of
the <HI>principal Tenants</HI> were bribed into his In|tere&s;t,
and that many others, who had ho|ne&s;t
Intentions, were afraid to oppo&s;e a
Man, who had it in his Power to <HI>rai&s;e their
Rent, di&s;train their Goods,</HI> or <HI>turn them out of
their Farms</HI> at Plea&s;ure, by repre&s;enting them
as <HI>bad Tenants</HI> or <HI>Enemies to their Landlord;</HI>
tho' the&s;e very People were the be&s;t affect|ed
<PB N="15" REF="20">
to their Landlord, tho' they paid their
Rents punctually, and had no other deme|rit,
but that they faithfully adhered to
what they conceived to be the true Intere&s;t
of Sir <HI>George.</HI> In &s;hort, it is the peculiar
Character of Mr. <HI>Lyn,</HI> That when he took
up a Prejudice, however unrea&s;onable, a|gain&s;t
any of the <HI>Tenants,</HI> he always <HI>made
it a POINT</HI> (as he call'd it) to <HI>ruin</HI> them
with Sir <HI>George,</HI> and &s;tuck at nothing to
compa&s;s his End.</P>
<P>YET notwith&s;tanding all this Power,
and this extravagant U&s;e of it, there are
many Per&s;ons of con&s;iderable Intere&s;t and
Figure in the <HI>Mannor,</HI> who have con&s;tant|ly
oppo&s;ed him in all the&s;e Proceedings, and
have, at pre&s;ent, the Plea&s;ure to &s;ee a gene|ral
Spirit of Re&s;entment ri&s;ing again&s;t him.
The Number of his <HI>Opponents</HI> increa&s;es dai|ly;
whil&s;t many, &s;ome even of <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> who
are <HI>obliged</HI> to act with him, are frequently
heard to murmur again&s;t his Proceed|ings,
in publick as well as private; and
others who eat his Bread, as he is in&s;o|lently
<PB N="I6" REF="21">
plea&s;ed to call it, Sir <HI>George</HI>'s Bread,
the Tenants Bread he means, hang down
their Heads; and con&s;cious of their Crime
in not oppo&s;ing his Mea&s;ures, plead guilty
to the Charge again&s;t him in their Silence.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Freemen</HI> of the Town, where
Sir <HI>George</HI> lives him&s;elf, are heartily, almo&s;t
univer&s;ally, incen&s;ed again&s;t him, on <HI>divers
Accounts;</HI> particularly for having introdu|ced
&s;everal <HI>New Cu&s;toms</HI> among&s;t them;
for always interpo&s;ing his Authority in their
<HI>Elections of Pari&s;h-Officers;</HI> for making
them pay more for their <HI>Fewel</HI> than the re&s;t
of the Tenants; for refu&s;ing to read a
<HI>Letter</HI> written in their behalf, on this Ac|count,
and replying with an in&s;olent Air,
<HI>That he did not care a</HI> F&mdash;t <HI>for the whole
Town.</HI></P>
<P>GREAT Numbers of <HI>poor Trade&s;|men,</HI>
who &s;upplied the late Sir <HI>George</HI>
with Nece&s;&s;aries, are ready to &s;tarve for
want of the Money, he died in arrear
to them on that Account; which is the
more extraordinary, becau&s;e Sir <HI>George</HI>
had always a &s;ufficient Income to keep
<PB N="17" REF="22">
a noble Houfe, and pay every body, as
indeed he &s;eem'd always inclinable to do;
from whence they conclude, That Mr.
<HI>Lyn</HI> embezzled great Sums him&s;elf, and
&s;quandered away others, for his own Va|nity
and Grandeur, among&s;t a <HI>wor&s;e kind
of TRADESMEN</HI> than they are.
Nay, what adds to the Provocation is,
That Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI> will not &s;atisfy them <HI>whe|ther
they &s;hall ever be paid or not.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>neighbouring Country Gentlemen</HI>
complain of him for <HI>engro&s;&s;ing the Game,</HI>
and forbidding them to hunt, or ride in Sir
<HI>George</HI>'s PARKS, as they u&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>THE Clergy charging him with recom|mending
Men of &s;low Parts for Preferment
in the Church to old Sir <HI>George,</HI> when any
<HI>Livings</HI> fell; of which there was a great
Number, during <HI>his Life</HI> and the <HI>Steward|&s;hip</HI>
of Mr. <HI>Lyn.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Yeomanry</HI> grumble for want of
Money, the <HI>Manufacturers</HI> for want of
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the <HI>poor Labourers</HI> for want of
Bread; and all impute their Misfortunes, I
<PB N="18" REF="23">
think, after what has been &s;aid, not very
unju&s;tly, to Mr. <HI>Lyn,</HI> by engaging old Sir
<HI>George</HI> in a <HI>needle&s;s, expen&s;ive</HI> and <HI>chimerical
Law-&s;uit,</HI> and thereby preventing the u&s;ual
<HI>Circulation</HI> of Money in Commerce, by di|verting
it into other <HI>Channels.</HI></P>
<P>IN &s;hort, all Ranks of Men (except a
<HI>few particular Creatures</HI> of his own) &s;eem
to have their re&s;pective Complaints again&s;t
him, and unite in their Wi&s;hes for a <HI>new
Steward.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, we have a current Report about
the Country, that our <HI>pre&s;ent Landlord</HI>
(who is a Gentleman of <HI>great Penetration,</HI>
and applies him&s;elf very much to <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI>)
hath been, for &s;ome time, of the &s;ame Opi|nion
with his <HI>Tenants;</HI> and altho it may not
be convenient to di&s;charge him at pre&s;ent, at
lea&s;t till his Accounts, which are in the ut|mo&s;t
Confu&s;ion, are audited and &s;ettled, yet
it is certain that he hath already <HI>clipt his
Wings, and &s;o &s;hort too,</HI> that he is unable to
take his <HI>former Flights.</HI></P>
<P>THIS hath a little &s;unk his Cre&s;t, and
&s;often'd his Behaviour to his <HI>Fellow-Tenants,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="24">
tho' he &s;till endeavours to keep up his u&s;ual
Spirit of <HI>Defiance;</HI> but we can ea&s;ily ob|&s;erve,
from the frequent <HI>Tremulation of his
Voice, the faultring of his Accents, his Lo&s;s
of Temper and Confu&s;ion in his Sentences,</HI> that
he is inwardly very much <HI>chagrined</HI> and <HI>di|&s;turb'd.</HI></P>
<P>YOU may remember, I told you, in my
<HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that Sir <HI>George</HI>'s E&s;tate (when he came
to it) was charged with an <HI>heavy Debt:</HI> And
that when Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI> was call'd upon to give
an Account of the <HI>great Sums of Money,</HI>
which had pa&s;&s;ed thro' his Hands, he always
refu&s;ed to do it, and endeavoured to make a
Je&s;t of <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who demanded it. But at length,
the general Clamour obliged him to con&s;ent
to <HI>&s;ome Examination;</HI> upon which it appears,
even by his <HI>own Account,</HI> that his Ma&s;ter's
E&s;tate is &s;o far from being the <HI>better</HI> for his
Management, according to his <HI>former re|peated
Declarations,</HI> that it is <HI>&s;everal hundred
Pounds more in debt,</HI> than it was before he
came into the <HI>Steward&s;hip,</HI> notwith&s;tanding
the <HI>great Sums</HI> which ought to have been
<HI>yearly</HI> applied towards paying it off.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="25">
BUT his <HI>manner of &s;tating Accounts</HI> is
&s;o very extraordinary, that I believe you
will think it worth relating.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI> hath always boa&s;ted, that the
<HI>Family-Debt</HI> was very much <HI>dimini&s;hed</HI>
within the&s;e <HI>ten</HI> or <HI>eleven Years</HI> pa&s;t, and <HI>de|fied</HI>
his Enemies to prove the contrary.
Now, in order to &s;ee whether this was true
or not, it was propo&s;ed, fir&s;t, to &s;tate the
<HI>Debt,</HI> as it &s;tood <HI>eleven</HI> Years ago, <HI>is all its
Branches.</HI> Then to deduct from it the &s;e|veral
<HI>yearly Sums,</HI> which have, or ought to
have been paid out of a certain <HI>&s;trong Box,</HI>
where the Savings from the Rents, after the
Expences of the Family were paid, were
con&s;tantly laid up, to di&s;charge part of the
Mortgage upon the E&s;tate, as it was appoint|ed
to do &s;ince <HI>that time;</HI> and afterwards to
compute the <HI>whole Debt, of every kind,</HI> which
the <HI>Family</HI> owes at <HI>pre&s;ent.</HI> It was agreed,
I think, that the <HI>Debt, eleven</HI> Years ago,
amounted to about 51000 <HI>l.</HI> The <HI>&s;trong
Box</HI> was &s;aid to have produced, &s;ince <HI>that
time,</HI> about 7000 <HI>l.</HI> which reduces the Debt
(had no <HI>farther Debt</HI> been incurred, as the
Phra&s;e in vogue is) to 44000; and, in what|ever
<PB N="21" REF="26">
degree the <HI>pre&s;ent Debt</HI> &s;hould appear to
be <HI>le&s;s than that Sum,</HI> &s;o much, and no more,
ought to be allowed to be <HI>really dimini&s;hed,</HI>
&s;ince <HI>that Time,</HI> by the Management of Mr.
<HI>Lyn;</HI> &s;ince he could not pretend to arrogate
to him&s;elf the Merit of <HI>paying any Sums,
which would have paid them&s;elves</HI> had he let
them alone.</P>
<P>THIS &s;eem'd to be a fair <HI>Propo&s;al,</HI> as it
was generally e&s;teemed; but fair as it was,
Mr. <HI>Lyn</HI> demurred to it. At fir&s;t, indeed, he
crack'd, blu&s;ter'd, and defy'd, as u&s;ual; at
length, with much Difficulty, he agreed to
give in &s;ome Account. Accordingly he
gave in his <HI>own State of the Account;</HI> and a
Day was appointed for the <HI>Enquiry;</HI> when
that came, he made a <HI>con&s;iderable Alteration</HI>
in his own Account. And having after|wards
acknowledged <HI>that he had quite forgot
&s;everal other considerable Sums of the Debt
contracted,</HI> he run his u&s;ual Circle; he a&s;|&s;erted,
affirmed, deny'd, was po&s;itive, was
every thing but intelligible; he talk'd in
&s;hort till he had not only made him&s;elf but
many of his Hearers giddy. There is not,
perhaps, &s;o great a Ma&s;ter in <HI>Europe</HI> of the
<PB N="22" REF="27">
grand Art of Bambou&s;le as Mr. <HI>Lyn:</HI> The
Debt (&s;aid he) is incurred, but not increa|&s;ed;
there are real Debts and nominal Debts;
there are real nominal Debts, and nominal
real Debts; there were real Debts and per|&s;onal
Debts, which the Family mu&s;t pay;
there are Debts never-&s;tated tho 'incurred,
and Debts which tho' incurred and &s;tated,
might never be paid; &s;o that upon the whole
you &s;ee I have paid off a con&s;iderable part of
the Mortgage upon Sir <HI>George</HI>'s E&s;tate: But
when he was told, that tho' it was true that
part of the <HI>Norfolk</HI> Mortgage was paid off,
yet Sir <HI>George</HI> was really now as much in
debt as before, becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Lyn,</HI> to per|form
this mighty Deed, had borrow'd ju&s;t
as much upon Sir <HI>George</HI>'s E&s;tate in <HI>Leice&s;ter|&s;hire,</HI>
as he had paid off in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> &s;o that
the Ballance continued as before; he broke
into a loud Laugh, and told the Tenants they
knew nothing of Accounts, nor the diffe|rence
between a Debt incurred and a Debt
increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>BY the Help of the&s;e <HI>Di&s;tinctions,</HI> and
this Jumble of <HI>Sophi&s;tries,</HI> he &s;truck off one
Article of <HI>above three thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> which
<PB N="23" REF="28">
he a&s;&s;erted to be a <HI>very good Bargain to the
Family;</HI> another of almo&s;t <HI>two thou&s;and,</HI>
becau&s;e it was owing to <HI>very bad Manage|ment;</HI>
and a third of <HI>one thou&s;and,</HI> for no o|ther
Rea&s;on, that I could hear, than that he
did not know how to <HI>ju&s;tify the contracting</HI>
of it, or in what manner to provide <HI>for its
Payment.</HI></P>
<P>HE had al&s;o the Mode&s;ty to place <HI>ano|ther
con&s;iderable</HI> Sum among&s;t the <HI>Debts di&s;|charged,</HI>
within <HI>that Time;</HI> which ought
really to have been placed among&s;t <HI>tho&s;e in|curred.</HI></P>
<P>IT is likewi&s;e worth ob&s;erving, that Mr.
<HI>Lyn</HI> had previou&s;ly taken care to puzzle and
perplex the <HI>Accounts</HI> as much as po&s;&s;ible, in
order to &s;ecure him&s;elf from <HI>Detection,</HI> by
chopping and changing the <HI>Securities into
different Hands;</HI> borrowing of <HI>one</HI> to pay
off <HI>another;</HI> turning <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> into <HI>Principal,</HI>
and <HI>Principal</HI> into <HI>Intere&s;t;</HI> with a thou&s;and
other <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Stratagems</HI> of the &s;ame kind;
&s;o that he had a manife&s;t Advantage over
<HI>Tho&s;e</HI> who were not in the <HI>Secret.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="29">
NAY, what is &s;till more extraordinary,
he &s;tated his Account of <HI>Debts contracted</HI> to
<HI>Chri&s;tmas la&s;t only;</HI> whereas he calculated the
Sum of <HI>Debts di&s;charged</HI> to <HI>Lady-day</HI> next;
a Method of <HI>&s;tating</HI> and <HI>ballancing Accounts,</HI>
which was never before practi&s;ed or heard of
in the&s;e Parts!</P>
<P>AND yet after all the&s;e <HI>Fine&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Fal|lacies,</HI>
and <HI>arbitrary Po&s;tulata,</HI> the <HI>pre&s;ent
Family-Debt</HI> evidently appear'd to be, ju&s;t
as it was <HI>eleven</HI> Years ago, <HI>fifty one thou&s;and
Pounds,</HI> or thereabouts.</P>
<P>THO' it is generally believed here, that
this Affair will not redound much to the
Credit of Mr. <HI>Lyn;</HI> yet it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed,
that his <HI>Arithmetical Capacity</HI> is really
admirable, and that he hath proved him|&s;elf,
beyond all Contradiction, to be a
complete Ma&s;ter of <HI>Addition,</HI> as well as
<HI>Sub&s;traction.</HI></P>
<P>To be continued as the Steward goes on.</P>
