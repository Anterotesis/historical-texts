<HEAD>AN
ESSAY,
At Removing National Prejudices, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HAving wrote two E&s;&s;ays in <HI>England</HI> upon the Subject
of the Union, and particularly to remove National
and Party Prejudices again&s;t the Treaty then on foot. I
calculated tho&s;e E&s;&s;ays principally for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> part,
where I always expected the difficulty would lye, and
where I met with certain radicated tho ill grounded Preju|dices
again&s;t the <HI>Scots as a Nation,</HI> as well as again&s;t the
Union which I thought a general Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But I confe&s;s my &s;elf &s;urpriz'd, when coming to <HI>Edin|burgh,</HI>
on &s;ome private Affairs of my own, I found my two
E&s;&s;ays Re-printed here, and forwardly handed about as
Arguments again&s;t that very Subject they were written to
Promote, I mean the Union; and that only upon this
weak Suppo&s;ition, that becau&s;e I had only in&s;i&s;ted upon the
Advantages to <HI>England,</HI> in Union; that therefore I did
not pretend <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould any way be better'd by it.</P>
<P>To this my An&s;wer is very &s;hort; that I had always too
great a re&s;pect for the <HI>Scots,</HI> to write a Satyr upon the Na|tion:
And that thinking it impo&s;&s;ible any <HI>Scot&s;man</HI> could be
<PB N="4" REF="3">
to &s;eek in the real, numerous, and &s;o vi&s;ible Advantages,
<HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall reap by the Treaty; I thought it would &s;eem
to reflect too much upon the Gentlemen concern'd, to
pre&s;ume to tell them, what it was much better manners
for me to pre&s;ume they all knew already; and what by the
nature of the Thing became &s;o vi&s;ible, that to me it &s;eem'd,
none but the willfully Blind, <HI>whom I do not pretend to Cure,</HI>
could be at a lo&s;s about.</P>
<P>But &s;ince it is my misfortune to be thus mi&s;taken, and
that &s;ome People charge me with that Ignorance which
my re&s;pect for their Under&s;tanding, would not permitt me
to charge them with. I find my &s;elf oblig'd <HI>contrary to my
fixt re&s;olution of not medling on either &s;ide,</HI> to make this
&s;hort E&s;&s;ay on the re&s;pective Advantages of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the
depending Treaty of Union; and this I &s;hall do as conci&s;e|ly
as I can, and carefully avoiding needle&s;s Digre&s;&s;ions,
come immediately to the Matter in hand.</P>
<P>Only before I begin the attempt, give me leave in duty
to the Government, and in defference to her Maje&s;ty, to
note that the expre&s;&s;ions of Advantages accruing to <HI>Scot|land</HI>
by the Union, are &s;o plain in her Maje&s;ty's Royal
Letter, and &s;o a&s;&s;erted in the re&s;pective Speeches of his
Grace the Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner, and the Lord Chancellor,
at the opening the pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, that one
would think no Man could read that Letter, and tho&s;e
Speeches, and ask afterwards what the Advantages to
<HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall be by the Union.</P>
<P>When her Maje&s;ty tells her Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> She <Q REND="margQuotes">is
fully per&s;uaded it will prove the greate&s;t Happine&s;s of her
People; that it will be the &s;olid Foundation of la&s;ting
Peace; it will &s;ecure your Religion, Liberty and Proper|ty,
remove the Animo&s;ities among&s;t your &s;elves, and
<PB N="5" REF="4">
the Jealou&s;ies and Differences betwixt Our two King|doms:
It mu&s;t increa&s;e your Strength, Riches and
Trade; and by this Union the whole I&s;land being joyn'd
in Affection, and free from all apprehen&s;ion of different
Intere&s;ts, will be enabled to re&s;i&s;t all its Enemies, &s;up|port
the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t every where, and maintain
the Liberties of <HI>Europe.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">That to bring this Union to pa&s;s, is the only effectual
way to &s;ecure your pre&s;ent and future Happine&s;s, and
di&s;appoint the De&s;igns of your and her Maje&s;ty's Ene|mies.</Q></P>
<P>When his Grace her Maje&s;tie's high Commi&s;&s;ioner has
inculcated the&s;e things and reminds you, <Q REND="margQuotes">That the
Queen e&s;teems it as the greate&s;t Glory of her Reign;
(not her glorious Succe&s;&s;es abroad excepted) to have
this mighty Affair concluded.</Q></P>
<P>When my Lord Chancellor tells you, <Q REND="margQuotes">You have
now the opportunity of e&s;tabli&s;hing for your &s;elves and
Po&s;terity, by this Union, all that concerns your Religi|on
and Liberties, and the mo&s;t valuable Privileges of
Trade.</Q></P>
<P>After all this has been &s;aid, is it not hard Gentlemen
you &s;hould ask a poor Stranger here, what <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hall
get by this Union; and why I did not go upon that in my
former E&s;&s;ays?</P>
<P>Really, Gentlemen, when I wrote tho&s;e E&s;&s;ays, I con|ceiv'd
them of u&s;e to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to convince &s;ome unbe|lieving
<HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> that your great Advantages &s;hould be
no injury to them. It was a loud and continued Cry there,
<HI>Ay, ay, we know the</HI> Scots <HI>will gain by this Union;</HI> but what
SHALL WE, <HI>we in England,</HI> be the better for it: And I
was challeng'd often to make out, what the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould
Gain by it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
Upon this I undertook that Subject, and really there
lies &s;ome unhappine&s;s in the alternative of this Matter,
and an impartial Writer, <HI>as I hope I may pretend to be,</HI> has
a great difficulty before him in urging the Advantages of
either Nation; &s;ince the Arguments to prove the Advan|tages
of one, &s;eem to argue the Di&s;advantages of the other.</P>
<P>My remedy for this is, what I have undertaken in ano|ther
place, <HI>viz.</HI> To convince both Parties, that their Ad|vantages
are mutual, reciprocal and &s;o equal, that 'tis
hard to determine which &s;ide &s;hall be the greater Gainer.</P>
<P>And this happy conjunction of good Events, I mu&s;t
confe&s;s, comes to pa&s;s from a thing many People have not
without plenty of Ignorance oppo&s;ed; I mean, the Union's
being CENTERAL: And as to all the e&s;&s;ential parts of
Con&s;titution Univer&s;al; &s;o that we are at liberty to give
that Word its full extent, UNION: And here I think it
can not be improper to explain how exten&s;ive I think <HI>the
word Union</HI> to be in this Ca&s;e; and how <HI>even by the Treaty,</HI>
it ought to be under&s;tood. It is a word comprehen&s;ive of
every thing Good to both; exclu&s;ive of all manner of Pre|ference
or Di&s;parity of Parts, abhorring all things Injuri|ous
or Dimini&s;hing to either; a full Coallition, a general
Incorporation of Nations, of Intere&s;ts, of Power, and of
Safety:&mdash;A Samene&s;s of Circum&s;tances and of Sympa|thies;
becoming one and the &s;ame Body, with one and the
&s;ame Head, Life, Soul, Nutriment, Point and Period.</P>
<P>Some Gentlemen who talk much of this Union, and ha|ving
known the Heads of it, yet pretend not to under&s;tand
it, would do very well to turn to their Books, and putting
together all the Etymologies, receiv'd Significations, cu|&s;tomary
Acceptations, and common readings of the words
<HI>Union</HI> and <HI>Incorporation,</HI> tell us what they under&s;tand by
<PB N="7" REF="6">
them, and how the true meaning of the Words, and the
new &s;ugge&s;tions of &s;eparate Exi&s;tence in the Government
can Con&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>But if this be too nice, and the Thought too much &s;ub|limated
for them, let me recommend to them a cour&s;e Si|mily.</P>
<P>I
liken this Union to a Body receiving Food, as Fle&s;h,
Fi&s;h, Fruit, Liquids, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All which, being incorporated and
dige&s;ted, concoct together, Unite their very Sub&s;tance
and di&s;&s;olve them&s;elves into one and the &s;ame Nutriment,
to the health, life, vigour and growth of the whole Body,
proportionedly and univer&s;ally.</P>
<P>If wrong Dige&s;tion, di&s;temper of the Body, or defect of the
Food, produces corruption, contagion or improper fermen|tation,
the mo&s;t remote Member, and the neare&s;t or more
immediate, equally feel their proportion'd want of Nou|ri&s;hment,
decay of Strength, di&s;temper and di&s;order; the
deficiency cannot be felt in the Head, and not in the
Foot, but weakne&s;s &s;ucceeds to all the Parts.</P>
<P>If our Union be Partial, Federal, Periodical or indeed
Notional, as mo&s;t of tho&s;e &s;chemes have been; then the de|fects
may be &s;o al&s;o: One part may thrive, and another
decay; And <HI>Scotland</HI> would be but too &s;en&s;ible of that, in
tho&s;e &s;orts of Union.</P>
<P>But if the Union be an Incorporation, a Union accor|ding
to the extent of the Letter, it mu&s;t then be a Union
of the very SOUL OF THE NATION, all its
Con&s;titution, Cu&s;toms, Trade and Manners, mu&s;t be
blended together, dige&s;ted and concocted, for the mutual
united, undi&s;tingui&s;h't, good, growth and health of the one
whole united Body; and this I under&s;tand by Union
And no wonder, they who con&s;ider the Nations in a le&s;s
<PB N="8" REF="7">
or more contracted Capacity of Union, are at a lo&s;s, to
find the Advantages of it.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, as thus United, would you know your
Advantages? They con&s;i&s;t of four &s;orts.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Trade,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Religion,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Civil Government,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Liberty and Soveraignty.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>1. In Trade, the united Riches, Stocks, Settlements,
Factories, and Dependencies of <HI>England,</HI> are concern'd
to promote yours; not as their Si&s;ter-<HI>Scotland,</HI> but as their
own Riches, Stocks in Trade, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Not in a &s;eparate but
an immediate Capacity, their Ports are yours, and you are
immediately Naturalized to, and Legitimated in their Cu|&s;tome-Hou&s;es,
Ports and Commerce; Your Manfuactures
are Carried to them, and what you want Imported from
them without Taxes, Tolls Di&s;tinction or Interruption.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Indies</HI> lyes at your Door, and you want Stock
to Gra&s;p that Sea of wealth the Fi&s;hery, your Fi&s;h and
their Stocks will Unite to fall into that u&s;eful affair, by
which <HI>your People</HI> will be Employed, <HI>your Seamen</HI> kept at
home, <HI>your Provi&s;ion</HI> con&s;umed, <HI>your Lands</HI> Improved,
<HI>your Nation</HI> Enriched, they &s;hareing with you in every one
of the&s;e, and you with them in every other Advantage.</P>
<P>'Twill be endle&s;s to E&s;&s;ay on the Freedom of your Linen
Manufacture into <HI>England,</HI> and it's prodigous Increa&s;s by the
taking off the Exorbitant Duty now laid upon it; the
Freedom of an Immediate Trade to all Our Colonies, de|nied,
<HI>Even to the Engli&s;h Subjects Inhabiting Ireland,</HI> The
flu&s;h Stocks of <HI>Engli&s;h Men</HI> falling into Trade with you, and
<PB N="9" REF="8">
the Currency and Flux of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bullion and Coin into all
parts of your Kingdom.</P>
<P>'Twould be worth your con&s;idering the advantages of
Introduceing <HI>Engli&s;h Improvements</HI> on your E&s;tates, and per|haps
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Farmers and Stocks on your Lands; the Ex|portation
of your Corn and Coals to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mercats, And
whether it will not be your own fault, if the&s;e things do
not in a few Years, double the Fee &s;imple, and rai&s;e the
Value of your E&s;tates <HI>Two for One.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are a few of the Advantages in Trade, which
would bear a higher enlargement, if it needed that I &s;hould
fir&s;t prove, this would keep your People at home; and
then Examine the infinite Alterations and Con&s;equences,
both to Land-Trade and ready Mony, which doubling
or trebbling the number of your People would produce.</P>
<P>'Tis a Slander upon your Country, to &s;ay, '<HI>tis a Barren
Land.</HI> Nature was commanded not to let Man have his
Bread out of her, but by the Sweat of his Brows; and
with that Sweat &s;he never denys him.</P>
<P>'Tis want of Trade to whet Indu&s;try, Profit to whet
Trade, Vent of Goods and Stock to produce Profit;
The&s;e are the Barrenne&s;&s;es your Country Complains of, and
Declines for want of.</P>
<P>Your Lands Enclo&s;ed, Manured and Cultivated, would
be <HI>as Rich,</HI> your Cattel <HI>as Large,</HI> your Sheep <HI>as Fat,</HI> and
your Wool <HI>as Fine</HI> as in <HI>England,</HI> your Barren Muirs would
yield Corn, the Hills Feed Flocks of Sheep, and your bet|ter
Lands which you now wholly Imploy with the
Plough, would Feed Strong, and Valuable Cattel, from
hence would proceed <HI>Darys,</HI> Milk, Butter, Chee&s;e, &amp;c.
which being plentiful, and Cheap would feed your Poor
in a better manner, and deliver them from the Mi&s;ery and
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Hard&s;hip which now makes your People fly from their
Native Country, and makes you the Nur&s;es of <HI>Europe,</HI>
that you have the trouble and expen&s;e of your Children till
they are grown up; and then other Nations reap the
Profit of their Labour.</P>
<P>But I can but touch the&s;e things here, perhaps I may
more largely Di&s;cour&s;e of both the evil and its remedy on
another occa&s;ion: But to bring it to the pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e,
the immediate Remedy for them is an UNION,
and as it is the only Remedy, &s;o it mu&s;t be a Remedy, you
mu&s;t partake of the general Improvement, both in Land,
Living and Trade; and I need &s;ay no more.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Powers mu&s;t be your Defence, the whole
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wealth mu&s;t be Engaged to you; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Navys mu&s;t be your Convo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and in all parts of the
World, your Ships have the Immediate Protection of their
Fleet, Ports, Forts&punc; and Forces: And this by the natu|ral
Con&s;equences of the UNION, not as you are their
Friends, Neighbours and Confederates: But as you are
them&s;elves, their own, it is become a Debt to you, their Sub|jects
mu&s;t Pay it, or be Traytors to their Soveraign, and
to their Native Country, which is yours and theirs Indefi|nitely,
and Undi&s;tingui&s;ht.</P>
<P>I know &s;ome Gentlemen will allow all this much rather than
be convinced of equal Advantages in another, yet more valu|able
Ca&s;e, viz. Religion which is the Second head of Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t own, I am a&s;toni&s;ht that any one can
help &s;eeing the Safety, Settlement and Perpetuity of the
E&s;tabli&s;ht Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> entirely wrapt up in the UNI|ON;
and indeed only to be &s;ecured by it.</P>
<P>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">therto you have been jealous of <HI>England,</HI> putting upon
you Epi&s;copacy, Tyrany, &amp;c. And I cannot &s;ay, 'tis
<PB N="11" REF="10">
without cau&s;e, and in ca&s;e of Ruptures, War, diferent So|veraigns,
and a Thou&s;and Ca&s;ualties and uncertainties, to
which the Church as now E&s;tabli&s;hed is &s;ubject, both from
<HI>England</HI> without, as di&s;tinctly and di&s;unitedly con&s;ider'd,
<HI>Which after the Queen no Body can an&s;wer for;</HI> and from a
numerous and doubly Di&s;affected Party at Home: Who, I
&s;ay, in ca&s;e of tho&s;e things, &s;hall An&s;wer, for what may or
may not befal the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;ht Church&punc; I dare &s;ay,
no Man, that has a true Zeal for it can &s;ay, he is ea&s;y in
the pre&s;ent condition of the Church, ab&s;tracted from this
Union.</P>
<P>Upon an Union, all the&s;e Fears vani&s;h, 'Tis for ever
rendered impo&s;&s;ible to Overthrow the Settlement of the
Presbyterian Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> But by Subverting the
con&s;titution, by ab&s;olute Arbitrary Government, and the
opene&s;t Bare-Fac'd Tyranny. The Church, and the con&s;ti|tution
the Spiritual and Temporal Liberty, have the
&s;ame Sanction, Sub&s;i&s;t and Depend upon the &s;ame Securi|ty,
are Defended by the &s;ame Power, Demanded by the
&s;ame Right, Twi&s;ted and Connected together, cannot
fall, but by the &s;ame Di&s;a&s;ter, Nor &s;tand, but by the
Support of one another.</P>
<P>'Tis true, Tyrannies may happen; and &s;o they may, and
are much more likly to do under your pre&s;ent Un&s;et|tled
po&s;ture, as to Succe&s;&s;ion, than otherwi&s;e; And there|fore
you will &s;till be more Safe than you are now. And
with this addition, that then all <HI>Brittain</HI> will be concern'd
for your Liberty and you will demand it, as your un|doubted
indi&s;putable Right: Which Right the other can
never con&s;ent to Abrogate or make Null, without making
it lawful, by the &s;ame Majority, to lo&s;e their own, and &s;o
<PB N="12" REF="11">
&s;hould one day come to &s;uffer, by the &s;ame experiment&punc;</P>
<P>And indeed, this is the only way, to reconcile that &s;trange
ab&s;urdity, of which I have taken notice el&s;e where, now grow|ing
up in both Nations, viz. <HI>The Danger of the Church,</HI>
that <HI>England</HI> &s;hould &s;ay, her Church will be in Danger;
and <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;ay, her Church will be in Danger: If both
the&s;e can be true, I confe&s;s, it has &s;omething very odd in
it. But, what is yet more ab&s;urd, is, that this &s;hould be
from a Union. Ble&s;s us! Union work this! How can
this be? 'Tis the nature of Union, to pre&s;erve, not di|&s;troy;
to &s;ecure, not endanger; to confirm, not Under|mine.
<HI>No, Gentlemen,</HI> if either of your Churches are in
Danger, it will be for want of the Union; So, and no
other way, the ab&s;urdity may be reconciled, and both
Churches be in Danger.</P>
<P><HI>In Union,</HI> Love, Peace, Charity and Mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance,
are natural con&s;equences; And can tho&s;e pull down any
Church? When-ever either party attempts upon the other,
the Union is Broke; 'Tis no more the thing, and can no
longer bear the Name. When the Union is Broke, the Con|&s;titution
is Overthrown; For, one link of this Chain be|ing
Broken, the whole Chain is rendred u&s;ele&s;s; the Force
of the one depending, upon the continuity of the re&s;t. The
fundamental is di&s;troy'd, the Government di&s;&s;olves, and
the whole I&s;land becomes a Mob, one Univer&s;al Rabble.
Ju&s;t as in the ca&s;e of a Tyrant, di&s;pen&s;ing with the Laws
and Setting up Arbitrary Power, Property cea&s;es, Au|thority
Di&s;&s;olves, Con&s;titution &s;uffocates, and the National
Capacity dyes.</P>
<P>'Tis true, Human Wi&s;dom can make nothing Indi&s;&s;ol|vible.
This Union may be broke, &s;o may <HI>Magna Carta;</HI> So
may the Con&s;titution. But Gentlemen, you have the &s;ame
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Security for your Church Settlement, that you have for
your Lives, Liberties and E&s;tates, and the &s;ame on one
&s;ide, that you have on another.</P>
<P>But &s;ays one, fill'd with jealou&s;ies of remote po&s;&s;ibilities,
even The Legislature may be bya&s;t, and a Parliament may
come that &s;hall Re&s;cind the Settlement of the Church of
Scotland &amp;c.</P>
<P>Put this into Engli&s;h, <HI>A Parliament may come, that may
Di&s;&s;olve the Con&s;titution, that may Re&s;cind the Union, that may
Sacrifice the whole Kingdom;</HI> it is ab&s;urd in it's nature, the
Union in it's being is the very Con&s;titution, the Life and
Soul of Great <HI>Brittain</HI> as to Government: And to &s;ay, a Parlia|ment
may come that can break the Con&s;titution, is to &s;ay, a
Parliament may be mad, po&s;&s;e&s;t, and <HI>Felo de &s;e;</HI> as a Parlia|ment,
they can not do &s;o, they cea&s;e from that moment to
be a Parliament, and become a Hou&s;e of Tyrants and a Den
of Robbers, nay, and of the wor&s;t &s;ort of Robbers, Strip|ping
tho&s;e they come to Protect.</P>
<P>If they would do this therefore, they can not, without
Di&s;&s;olving their own Being, Annihilating their own
Body, and committing all Imaginable Ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>They may Di&s;&s;olve them&s;elves, but Original natural
Right mu&s;t remain: if they di&s;&s;olve the Form <HI>whether &s;hall
it return?</HI>&mdash;To its primitive State it cannot, becau&s;e
that is di&s;&s;olv'd; to Confu&s;ion it mu&s;t not, becau&s;e Right
mu&s;t be pre&s;erved: Whenever therefore a Parliament de|&s;troys
the Con&s;titution, by which a Nation is Form'd, that
Parliament cea&s;es, and Power reverts to its original Source
to Form a new One.</P>
<P>Thus the Nature of the thing is its own Security, and
there needs no addition of other Force; if there does, the
Mouths of tho&s;e Gentlemen mu&s;t be &s;topt, in his Grace the
<PB N="14" REF="13">
high Commi&s;&s;ioner's Speech, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="margQuotes">That his Grace is im|powered
to Con&s;ent to what may be farther Nece&s;|&s;ary.</Q></P>
<P>What can be made more Firm? Are there any liga|ments
in the Law, qualified to bind the Church and the
Con&s;titution together, &s;o as that One cannot be hurt with|out
the Other; <HI>they are offered you,</HI> take them and tie it as
fa&s;t as Laws or Oaths can bind, or the <HI>Sacra Imperii</HI> of any
Nation be made</P>
<P>After this what &s;hall we &s;ay, is there any thing in the
Scruples of &s;ome in either of the E&s;tabli&s;ht Churches, which
goes beyond the real Security of the Church?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h tho&s;e Gentlemen would examine, whether it be
any more than a Scruple? And whether all the Obligation
they think them&s;elves under, is not limited by Po&s;&s;ibilities?
Whether it can be under&s;tood they &s;hould be bound to do,
that which they cannot really wi&s;h, <HI>the Publick Good and pre|&s;ent
Circum&s;tances con&s;idered,</HI> were in their power to do?</P>
<P>Let &s;uch Gentlemen con&s;ider how far their Sincerity as
well as Judgment will be called in que&s;tion in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Whether really &s;ecuring the Church, which they embrace
as truly and only Orthodox, be not the mo&s;t effectual &s;tep
they can take to pull down all fal&s;e Churches, and con&s;e|quently
a full Di&s;charge of the &s;acred Obligation they think

<P>'Tis certain, as things are, the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is far
from Safe; and I &s;hould be excu&s;able if I &s;hould &s;ay no|thing
but Miracle or a Union, can make her &s;o: He then
that effectually E&s;tabli&s;hes the true Church of Chri&s;t in the
World, effectually &s;uppre&s;&s;es and pulls down all other
Churches in the language of his Capacity; as he a&s;&s;i&s;ts to
place that Church in a po&s;ture of Victory over all her Ene|mies,
<PB N="15" REF="14">
by a liberty of u&s;ing all her &s;piritual Weapons, <HI>viz.</HI>
The &s;uperiour Doctrine and &s;anctity of her Mini&s;try; and
I wi&s;h, there were no other Contention between the two
Churches.</P>
<P>If the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is now in a precarious, un&s;afe,
and un&s;ettled Condition, and may be Secured by the Uni|on,
then the Members of this Church, can no more ask
me what they Gain by the Union, nor an&s;wer it to their
Con&s;ciences, or their Po&s;terity, that they &s;hould op|po&s;e
her Settlement in this the day of her E&s;tabli&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>But,
&s;ay the Gentlemen, that in behalf of the Church ar|gue
again&s;t the Union as now propo&s;ed; <HI>We in</HI> Scotland
<HI>are not &s;afe by the Union,</HI> for we are deprived of our Parlia|ment,
and <HI>delivered over</HI> to the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> and
<HI>we do not know,</HI> but &s;uch a Time may come, when the Par|liament
of <HI>England who&s;e Con&s;titution is wholly Epi&s;copal,</HI> may
Vote our Church down, and Erect the Epi&s;copal Church of
<HI>England,</HI> as the E&s;tabli&s;hment of great <HI>Britain;</HI> putting us
off in <HI>Scotland</HI> with a Toleration, which al&s;o they may
by an occa&s;ional Bill, Reduce again to any thing they
plea&s;e.</P>
<P>This I take to be the &s;umm and &s;tate of the Que&s;tion;
For really, what the other Party objects, in my opinion, car|ries
with it no weight.</P>
<P>To argue what an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament may do,
and what they may not do, &s;eems to me to be &s;o conjectu|ral,
that it leaves no room to call it an Argument. And
let Opinion go which way it will, or Probability bya&s;s
which way it will; this will follow, 'tis as po&s;&s;ible, and I
mu&s;t ask pardon for thinking, that 'tis more probable, a
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<HI>Scots</HI> Parliament may be obtain'd, to ruine Presbytery,
than an <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>And I &s;hall turn the very &s;ame Arguments, which are
u&s;ed again&s;t this Matter, upon the Gentlemen <HI>that u&s;e them,</HI>
thus;</P>
<P>The &s;trong Rea&s;ons given, why an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament
may do this, are &s;uch as the&s;e,</P>
<P>The great Intere&s;t of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and her in|fluence
in the Parliament; Her having prevail'd to conti|nue
the Te&s;t-Act impo&s;e it on the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Di&s;&s;enters, and
attempt it on the Colonies; Her power to influence Electi|ons,
in both Kingdoms; the nearne&s;s to carrying the oc|ca&s;ional
Bill; Her &s;trong &s;truggles for it the ea&s;ine&s;s to
Bribe or take off the 45 Members <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons why there is no danger from a <HI>Scots</HI> Par|liament,
are &s;uch as the&s;e,</P>
<P>That the Act making it Trea&s;on to impugn any Article
of the Claim of Right, makes it dangerous to attempt it in
the Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>That the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Scotland</HI> are too &s;en|&s;ible
of the Calamities formerly brought upon the Nation,
have &s;uffered too much by them to offer at Embroiling the
Nation again upon that account.</P>
<P>That the example of the Parliament cho&s;en after King
<HI>William</HI>'s death is an Argument for this, in which an Au|thor
&s;ays, there were more High-Church-men Elected than
in any Parliament &s;ince the Re&s;toration&mdash;who were &s;o
far from re&s;toring Epi&s;copacy, that they would not allow
the Epi&s;copal Clergy the Toleration they Petitioned for.</P>
<P>This as the &s;umm of the projected Di&s;parity is what
is now offered upon this Head, which in &s;hort I abridge
thus '<HI>tis a Compari&s;on of Probabilities.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
That 'tis probable from both Circum&s;tances, and Ex|amples,
that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament may Undo the Church
Settlement of <HI>Scotland;</HI> but 'tis not probable, the Parlia|ment
of <HI>Scotland</HI> can do it.</P>
<P>This I de&s;ire to &s;peak briefly to; and if I &s;hould chance
to turn the &s;cale of Probabilities again&s;t them, then I leave
it to it's Con&s;equences; whether the World will not give it,
again&s;t the&s;e Gentlemen, who, with their Imperfect Union,
are for leaving us, ju&s;t where they found us, or wor&s;e.</P>
<P>That the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> is compo&s;ed of Church
Men, is true; and that the Par&s;ons, tho not near 10000
<HI>as is &s;aid,</HI> Vote, and the Church may Influence Elections ve|ry
much is all true; and yet under all this, and under &s;uch
Reigns, as in which the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> have been mo&s;t
hated, they could never obtain any Effectual Law to &s;up|pre&s;s
them And at la&s;t the Poweer of Truth, and the Rea|&s;on
and Nature of things &s;o prevailed, that the Di&s;&s;enters
are not only Secur'd, but the whole Nation is come over to
them, in the Doctrines of Government, Right and Li|berty.</P>
<P>The
Di&s;&s;enters are not gone back an Inch, but the
Church a&s;ham'd of their Per&s;ecutions and Oppre&s;&s;ions, <HI>which
like Excentrick motions always revolve of Cour&s;e to regularities,
and more Natural Rules,</HI> return'd again by length of time to
her &s;elf, and own'd her Error, Declar'd Per&s;ecution again&s;t
her Principles; and freely fall in with Tolleration and Li|berty.</P>
<P>They
&s;ee the Di&s;&s;enters and the Church have but one
Civil Intere&s;t, and that Liberty is the Safety of both,
they're Convinc'd not Conquerd, reduc't not by Power or Par|ty,
but by the nature of things, they come to their Sen&s;es a|gain.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">
After this, upon another Sally under a <HI>High-Church-Mini|&s;try,</HI>
the Te&s;t was foi&s;ted upon the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and
&s;ome extravagancies Acted in <HI>England;</HI> but mark, how
&s;oon did the&s;e Attempts in the Authors blow up the Mini|&s;try,
and meer Nature bring all things to Rights again?</P>
<P>To in&s;tance, in the Attempt on the Colonies, which is the
&s;tory of <HI>Carolina,</HI> me thinks is very odd, &s;ince to read the
misfortune of my Lord <HI>Gr&mdash;lle</HI> on that Head, with what
contempt he has been treated, and how mortified for offe|ring
&s;uch a thing, but on a poor handful of Planters, me
thinks, I &s;ay, it &s;hould &s;trangely weaken the Arguments of
tho&s;e, who &s;eem to &s;ugge&s;t the&s;e things.</P>
<P>The&s;e People &s;eem to me a little Infatuated, and to Ar|gue
again&s;t them&s;elves, for, in order to Prove that &s;uch a cer|tain
thing as attempting the Supre&s;&s;ion of Presbytry may
come to pa&s;s, they bring upon the Stage all the In&s;tances
of the&s;e attempts, in which the People attempting, have
mi&s;carried; and can tell but one in which they Succeeded,
viz. the putting the Te&s;t upon <HI>Ireland, which by the way,</HI>
had never pa&s;t neither, had not the Di&s;&s;enters in meer &s;elf de|nial
for the Publick Good, re&s;ted under the hard&s;hip, rather
than venture to lo&s;e the Bill again&s;t the growth of Popery;
a thing the&s;e Gentlemen, I &s;uppo&s;e, knew nothing of, and
a Genero&s;ity the other Party are but very little acquainted
with.</P>
<P>'Tis hard now Gentlemen, that becau&s;e the High-flying-Church-Men
have always attempted the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
and mi&s;carried, to argue from thence that therefore
they &s;hall in&s;ult the <HI>Scots</HI> Settlement and &s;ucceed. I think
it had been a much &s;tronger way of Arguing, to &s;ay, that
being unable with their united &s;trength, ever to gain upon
the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> who, by their own Calculation,
<PB N="19" REF="18">
are not above one to twelve, they &s;hall certainly be the
le&s;s able to prevail when in conjunction with the <HI>Scots</HI> In|tere&s;t
and Members.</P>
<P>As to the occa&s;ional Bill and the nearne&s;s of its being
pa&s;s'd; 'tis plain it was a &s;urprize, the &s;nare was not &s;een at
fir&s;t, but with what indignation the re&s;erves and &s;ecret
de&s;igns again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters were treated when di&s;co|vered,
I leave to the Reader to find in the Journals of both
Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>From hence we come to the Probabilities on the other
hand, <HI>viz.</HI> That there is no danger of the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament
being &s;educed; the &s;ame Author grants the new 45 and
16 may be bought by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court, but the whole
Parliament cannot be &s;o;&mdash;and yet I believe mo&s;t
People will join in this, that let the Court at any
time be &s;ure to buy 45 and 16 in either Parliament they
&s;hall generally &s;peaking, carry any thing they de&s;ire; &s;o
that this is ab&s;urd, and by no means a ju&s;t way of Argu|ing.</P>
<P>Another contradiction takes off very much of the Credit
of this kind of Arguing, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Act making it Trea|&s;on
to impugn any Article of the Claim of Right, makes
it dangerous to attempt this in the Parliament of <HI>Scot|land.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but be &s;urpriz'd to find any Man can &s;ay this
is not an Argument ju&s;t the other way, that it is not as
lawful a Security to the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Parliament, or in the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> as in that of
<HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Is not this Act to remain in Force after the Union, and
may it not be made a part of the Treaty, and can the Par|liament
<PB N="20" REF="19">
of <HI>Britain</HI> Vote what is declared by the Treaty to
be high Trea&s;on to attempt; 'tis certainly as great a
Security to the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> as can be de&s;ir'd,
that 'tis declar'd high Trea&s;on to impugn her Settle|ment.</P>
<P>Shall
it be objected, that the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> may
Repeal this; I an&s;wer, and &s;o may the Parliament of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
whenever they plea&s;e, as it now &s;tands, but if made a
Capitulation of the Treaty, according to my notion of the
Treaty, it can never be altered but by meer Tyranny, Per|jury,
Violence and U&s;urpation.</P>
<P>This is the pre&s;ent Security of the Presbyterian Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;he is E&s;tabli&s;h't by Parliament, the Soveraign
is Sworn not to alter it, and 'tis high Trea&s;on in the Sub|ject
to attempt it; and all this made a Stipulation previous
to the Treaty, which cannot be broken. If this be not
Security &s;ufficient, I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee &s;omething bet|ter
offered to the high Commi&s;&s;ioner, that according
to his Grace's Speech, it may be pa&s;t into &s;uch a Law,
as may make them fully ea&s;y.</P>
<P>It is unhappy, that the Gentlemen who argue on this
Head, will allow the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or the Court, or
both, may have an influence over the whole Parliament of
<HI>Britain;</HI> but cannot have an influence over the &s;o much
&s;maller Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I have heard it &s;ugge&s;ted by the Enemies of the Nation
of the <HI>Scots,</HI> that they are Poor and Mercenary, and may
be all bought by the Court with 100000. <HI>l.</HI> If this &s;lander
be true, 'tis fir&s;t a &s;ign that the pre&s;ent Government in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
does not Bribe them now. Secondly 'tis plain, that
they are not to be Brib'd into the Union, for that the Mo|ney
has not produc'd the Effect yet, and the Court of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="20">
or high-Church, have not on all occa&s;ions bought &s;uch
Bills as they have had occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the&s;e Gentlemen, put &s;o little &s;tre&s;s
on the 45 Votes in the Hou&s;e of Commons in <HI>Britain,</HI> that
they think they may be always out Voted, and the <HI>Scots</HI>
may have bad luck to have no Friends in the Hou&s;e of
Commons but their own 45.</P>
<P>Now, this is the very pretence on the other part of the
Que&s;tion in <HI>England,</HI> where the Gentlemen put us in mind
how fatal 45 <HI>Scots</HI> Members may be to the Church, in con|junction
with the Whigs there; and I am in &s;ome &s;eeming
&s;traight in pu&s;hing either part of the Argument, both &s;ides
taking hold of it: If I &s;ay in <HI>England</HI> they are too few to
Hurt us, then &s;ay the <HI>Scots,</HI> they are to few to Secure us:
If I &s;ay in <HI>Scotland</HI> they are enough to Secure you, then &s;ay
they in <HI>England</HI> they are enough to Hurt us.</P>
<P>This is a very unhappy Ca&s;e, and the Artifices of our
Writers on this Head &s;eem very mean here; they are forc'd
to run counter again&s;t one another, and make &s;uch &s;hifts,
turns and doubles, to bring things to bear, as I can not
but wonder at.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court <HI>&s;ay they,</HI> may Bribe the 45 Members
and 16 Lords in the Parliament of <HI>Britain</HI> and they may
join with their Counties Enemies to betray <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>But in the <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament they pretend they are &s;afe,
and the Church will be Secured by them, for <HI>they</HI> cannot
be Brib'd, Bought or Bya&s;st.</P>
<P>Again, the Court may get all Epi&s;copal Men to Repre&s;ent
the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> at the Parliament of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>But they can get none that will &s;o much as agree to a
Toleration of Epi&s;copacy, while they belong to the Parlia|ment
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;o that to Day they may be Brib'd, to
<PB N="22" REF="21">
Morrow they can not; to Day they may be all Epi&s;copal
Men, to Morrow they will be a Security again&s;t Epi&s;copa|cy.</P>
<P>Now,
take the high-Church-Men in <HI>England,</HI> and their
Ab&s;urdities are not fewer than the&s;e, to Day they tell us 45
<HI>Scots</HI> Men will bring Presbytery into <HI>England,</HI> and pull
down the Church; to Morrow the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI>
are not one to twelve, and we mu&s;t force the <HI>Scots</HI> to re|&s;tore
the Church. Thus, one way a thing is Great, and
another way Small; one way Secure, and another way in
Danger.</P>
<P>Now, let us place the&s;e People one again&s;t another in
each Kingdom. In <HI>England</HI> 45 <HI>Scots</HI> Commoners and
16 Lords, will certainly bring in Presbytery and pull down
the Church of <HI>England;</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> they will join to bring
in Epi&s;copacy being brib'd and bought to pull down the
Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>To Day they are &s;o many they will endanger the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Church, to Morrow &s;o few they can't defend their own.</P>
<P>To Day they will be &s;o true to Presbytery, they will
never leave Caballing to pull down Epi&s;copacy, to Mor|row
&s;o fal&s;e they will &s;ell their Country, join in voting
Epi&s;copacy up in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and reduce the pre&s;ent Church
to a Toleration.</P>
<P>The&s;e things are very counfounding, and no Man can
be prepar'd to debate with Men that will thus go upon all
manner of Po&s;&s;ibilities.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, in my weak Ob&s;ervation, I think they come
all from the &s;ame Fountain, and are agitated by the &s;ame
Spirit: <HI>I mean</HI> from <HI>England,</HI> where a vigorous Party
&s;truggles again&s;t the Union of the Kingdoms, as the only
mi&s;chief can befall their High-Church Cau&s;e, and effectual|ly
<PB N="23" REF="22">
deprive them of the opportunities of Embroiling both
Nations.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h this Kingdom a little better inform'd of the pra|ctices
of tho&s;e People, and entirely deliver'd from their In|fluence.
I ob&s;erve all or mo&s;t part of the Pamphlets again&s;t
the Union, are form'd in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ent from thence, in
which the Authors &s;ugge&s;t things falfe in Fact, pre&s;uming
upon the di&s;tance of the Place, and that they &s;hall be taken
upon their words.</P>
<P>They repre&s;ent the Union, as a thing which depends
wholly upon the Parliament in this Kingdom, and&mdash;the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> entirely acquie&s;cing in the matter; nay &s;ome have
repre&s;ented it as a thing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are courting and wheed|ling
this Kingdom to, in order to bring them under; and
that there is nothing to do, but to get the <HI>Scots</HI> to comply
with it.</P>
<P>In order to this, every <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> here, whether by his
Curio&s;ity, private Affairs, or by whatever other occa&s;ion
brought here, is rendred &s;u&s;pected as if &s;ent from <HI>England</HI>
as an Emi&s;&s;ary to officiate here, in preparing the <HI>Scots</HI> to
their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I do believe, that in <HI>England</HI> there is a general happy
di&s;po&s;ition to this Union, e&s;pecially in the wi&s;e&s;t, be&s;t and
gteate&s;t part of that Kingdom; and that this Temper is ex|ceedingly
promoted and encrea&s;ed by her Maje&s;tie's &s;teady
adherence to it, as the only means to &s;ecure the Peace and
Happine&s;s of both Nations, and as much as po&s;&s;ible, cru|&s;hing,
checking and di&s;couraging, the Party that are again&s;t
it: And I do acknowledge, to believe, that this happy
di&s;po&s;ition is &s;uch at this time, that if the Parliament of
<HI>Scotland</HI> clo&s;es with it, and no unrea&s;onable difficulties are
rai&s;ed from hence, it will be compleated there.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
But I intreate the Gentlemen on this &s;ide, to bear with
me in telling them, this happy temper in <HI>England</HI> has not
been &s;o ea&s;y a thing to procure. Abundance of vi&s;ible
Providences have been remarkably Concurring, to bring
this Conjuncture to &s;uch a Cri&s;is. Great havock has been
made, by their own follies, in the intere&s;t of a party, under
an admini&s;tration, that would never have made the at|tempt.</P>
<P>Victories,
of various &s;orts, have contributed to the
work, and a connexion of wonders have brought it to pa&s;s;
a conque&s;t at home, &s;uperiour to <HI>Blenheim</HI> or <HI>Ramellies,</HI>

Peace and Union has made large &s;trides and rid over the

and party &s;trife.</P>
<P>The Queen, nay the very Bi&s;hops too, have been called

that is Scandalous. Every Moderate Church Man has

<P>What Tacking, what Projecting, what Caballing have

<P>Nor are the Party yet in Di&s;pare, but with all Imaginable

they own the Union will De&s;troy them, and I am very &s;ory
to &s;ee the Subtilty of their Proceeding extends hither.</P>
<P>They leave no Stone untur'nd, they Play Whiggs again&s;t

<P>Why is it they talk &s;o much of the &s;ecurity of the Church,
and fill your Heads with fear of the Church, whence mu&s;t
this fear come? it mu&s;t come from the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> Pray
Gentlemen, how comes it to pa&s;s, that in <HI>England</HI> all your
Friends are again&s;t you, and all your Enemies are for you;

<P>All the High Church Men, all the Enemies of your Im|provement,

very In&s;truments of former Tyrannys in <HI>England,</HI> talk of
Pre&s;erving your Laws, Parliaments and Judicatorys.</P>
<P>This is really &s;o My&s;terious, that I think it's worth your
Ob&s;ervation, and no doubt, but you will find good rea&s;on
from it, to quicken your Application to the Union.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this E&s;&s;ay with two thinges for I cannot

<P>His Grace the hihg Commi&s;&s;ioner has Acquainted you, that

Scruples and Fears of tho&s;e really concerned for the Church.</P>
<P>Now, in laying hold of her Maje&s;ties offer by His Grace

&s;eems to me, to be one ready Step to make both &s;ides
ea&s;ie, and to remove the Jealou&s;ies on either hand, as to
the Danger of the Church, whether Presbyterian or Epi&s;|copal;
and the Matter is very &s;hort, viz. That an Act of

a Claim of Church Rights, a Declaration of the
State of either Church, its Con&s;titution and Government,
with a formal Capitulation, or Clau&s;e of E&s;tabli&s;hment,
for either Church, and proper Provi&s;ions, Articles and Li|mitations
between them, Declareing their Powers and Ex|tent.
Which Acts being fir&s;t Pa&s;t in either Kingdom, be
afterwards Incorporated into, and made part of the Treaty
as an E&s;&s;ential Condition of the &s;aid Union, and this no
Doubt will be Granted.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, this may be Ca&s;s'd Annull'd, or afterwards
made Void, &s;eems Invidious, and is to my Apprehen&s;ion
Talking nothing at all, for no Sub&s;equent Parliament can
make Null any Article of the Treaty,&mdash;it would be no
Treaty, if this could be. The Treaty is the Foundation
and Con&s;tituent Head of the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> and
gives it a Being, and therefore is &s;o far Superiour in it's
Power, as not to be De&s;troyed by its own Sub&s;titute, and
as I have &s;aid el&s;ewhere, to breake the Treaty, is to Di&s;|&s;olve
the Con&s;titution and very Being of the Parliament,
and Overthrow the Union; and to think <HI>England</HI> will Con|tribute
to Breaking the Treaty, is too hard a Sugge&s;tion,
and what I care not to enter upon the Di&s;cription of here.</P>
<P>How Prepo&s;terous is it to Judge, that a Parliament &s;hould
hereafter Annull and Aboli&s;h, in Prejudice of a whole King|dom,
<PB N="27" REF="26">
what, before the very Being of that Parliament was
Declar'd to be their Right, and A&s;&s;ented to, Granted and
Capitulated for, on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>'Tis true, 'tis po&s;&s;ible to be done, 'tis po&s;&s;ible that after
this <HI>England</HI> may Rai&s;e an Army, and come and De&s;troy
<HI>Scotland;</HI> but it mu&s;t be Contrary to Faith, Ju&s;tice, Ho|nour,
Right, Law and Liberty, and this mu&s;t in its Na|ture
Di&s;&s;olve the Con&s;titution, and return the whole I&s;land
to its Divided State.</P>
<P>But &s;till &s;ays an Objector, we can not help our &s;elves, to
take up Arms will be Trea&s;on and Rebellion &amp;c. And
we &s;hall be Treated as Perjur'd Rebells.</P>
<P>I An&s;wer, it will be Trea&s;on and Rebellion in the Letter
of the Thing, but not in the Meaning of the Law; &s;o the
taking up Arms to Joyn the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was Trea&s;on.
And had King <HI>James</HI> Defeated that Prince, and Fru&s;trated
the Revolution, the Gentlemen at <HI>Notingham</HI> would &s;oon
have found them&s;elves Treated as Rebells, and the Con&s;e|quences
would have been Bloody enough.</P>
<P>But here would be no other Ground for it, than was there;
and &s;hould ever &s;uch an Infraction of the Treaty happen,
I make no Scruple to &s;ay, the whole Con&s;titution would be
di&s;&s;olved, Authority dye, and things would as before Revolve
either to their Divided State, or into all kinds of Confu&s;ions.</P>
<P>'Tis unkind, I confe&s;s, to offer &s;uch things, of a Body
of Gentlemen, Cho&s;en out of the whole I&s;land, and 't would
be endle&s;s, to give them An&s;wers; 'tis Impo&s;&s;ible there can
be Men enough found in a Parliament, to clo&s;e with &s;o
open a Breach of the very Con&s;titution, upon which they
them&s;elves &s;tood. Nor is <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;o Incon&s;iderable a Na|tion,
that <HI>England</HI> &s;hould offer &s;o foully to Break with them,
and with &s;o little Rea&s;on; Since, in the Ca&s;e Propo&s;ed,
<PB N="28" REF="27">
there can be no pretence to u&s;e you &s;o hardly, but what
mu&s;t be meerly Tyrannical and an Original Violence: In
which, they could expect no Aid, from Heaven or Hone&s;t
Men. 'Tis a Pro&s;pect &s;o Horrid, that I cannot look into
it without concern. No Party-Heats can run to &s;uch a
length; Not the Parliament in King <HI>Charles</HI> the 2ds time,
<HI>tho' Loaded with Pen&s;ions and Places,</HI> could be brought to
Part with any Branch of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, neither
can they here, for it will be all one whole Settlement, and
a Di&s;&s;olution on one &s;ide, Di&s;&s;olves the other of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I think <HI>Scotland</HI> can have no Security like this Treaty, it
is back't with the Con&s;titution, 'tis Fortified with Capi|tulated
Rea&s;on, and when ever the Flood of Parties attacks
it, 'twill Run-Back and Drown its Contrivers.</P>
<P>If any Man talks of propo&s;ing more than can be had, it
gives good ground to &s;ugge&s;t he &s;hall be be&s;t plea&s;ed with
the denial.</P>
<P>I would cen&s;ure no body in their propo&s;ing higher De|mands
than are rea&s;onable, and &s;uch as in their nature
mu&s;t embarra&s;s the Treaty, alarm <HI>England,</HI> and de&s;troy
the hopes of an Union; but this I mu&s;t &s;ay, 'tis ju&s;t what
they are for, who wi&s;h the Treaty broke off: And 'tis
&s;trange Friends and Enemies &s;hould both hit on the &s;ame
thing, and both propo&s;e <HI>for &s;uch va&s;tly different rea&s;ons,</HI> the
&s;ame Conditions; tis to me a too vi&s;ible di&s;covery of the
Weakne&s;s on one hand, and the Policy on the other, and
that's all I &s;hall &s;ay to it.</P>
<P>I hope the Gentlemen concern'd here, will be too wary
to offer any thing too hard for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament to
grant; and this is the thing with which I &s;hall end this
Di&s;cour&s;e. To impo&s;e &s;omething on the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which
'tis known will not pa&s;s, or which Circum&s;tances con&s;ider'd
<PB N="29" REF="28">
can not; this would be to come to the Union, but not with
the Spirit of Union.</P>
<P>I frankly own, I &s;ee no di&s;po&s;ition in the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation
to do &s;o, and hope I &s;hall not be con&s;trued to &s;ugge&s;t it in
this Ca&s;e; I have too much re&s;pect for the <HI>Scots</HI> Na|tion
to imagine &s;uch a thing:&mdash;But I mu&s;t own I
believe, that very thing is the top of the Party-Politicks
now on foot in <HI>England</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, and a|gain&s;t
the Union in general; to bring <HI>Scotland</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, to
in&s;i&s;t upon &s;omething which they know <HI>England</HI> cannot
grant; and for this rea&s;on we have all their Books again&s;t
the Union crowded with Queries about Guarantees, Secu|rities,
&s;eparate Parliaments, partial and imperfect Unions,
and the like.</P>
<P>I acknowledge my &s;elf convinc'd, that the Union is the
general Safety of <HI>Britain,</HI> that it is the particular advan|tage
of either Nation; and if I was to be askt, whether
Nation have greater advantages from it, I profe&s;s my &s;elf
nncapable of giving a direct an&s;wer; on this Head it is
that I Di&s;cour&s;e, I am per&s;uaded mutual Security, mutual
Improvement and mutual Pro&s;perity, attends it on both
&s;ides.</P>
<P>But there mu&s;t be al&s;o mutual Confidences and mutual
Affections, or 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to Unite; Jealou&s;ies, Feuds
and Su&s;picions, will rob the Nations of the fruit even
of the Union it &s;elf. There cannot be a flux of profitable
Trade, an ea&s;y, free and uninterrupted conjunction in
Circum&s;tances and Families, a Coallition of Stocks, Under|takings
and Improvements, i&s; National prejudices are not
remov'd.</P>
<P>If a new Seal be made, or a new Armorial En&s;ign for
<HI>Britain</HI> directed, I wi&s;h the Motto might be, WE ARE
<PB N="30" REF="29">
BRETHREN, and the Text will add the re&s;t, <HI>Gen.</HI> 13. 8.
<HI>Let there be no &s;trife between us.</HI></P>
<P>Let firm Articles, compleat E&s;tabli&s;hments, and full Calu|&s;es
form the Union, and the fa&s;ter the better; but let us
not Treat with embarra&s;&s;ing Su&s;picions, politick Jealou&s;ies,
and uncharitable cenforious Apprehen&s;ions of one another,
e&s;pecially where the very Nature of things helps to make
them &s;afe; and where both Nations &s;eem to mean nothing
but what is &s;incere.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s when I con&s;ider this, I wonder to &s;ee <HI>&s;ome
Libels</HI> and Pamphlets appear here, in which they grant a
nearer Union of the Kingdoms nece&s;&s;ary for their mutual
Service, and yet endeavour all along to foment Jealou&s;ies
between the Nations; particularly that <HI>England</HI> &s;hall op|pre&s;s
<HI>Scotland</HI> after the League is Concluded, and that She
will not Perform the Conditions.</P>
<P>Nay, one Gentleman forgets him&s;elf &s;o far, as to tell
you very po&s;itively, if you agree for an Equivalent
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State of the Contro|ver&s;y. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. 22.</NOTE>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will not Pay you the Money, and
the rea&s;on he gives for it is this.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">'Tis Incident to the Nature of Man, not to
perform Bargains, or Pay their Debts, unle&s;s
they are Compell'd to it, and if not Private Men, far le&s;s
Societys.</Q></P>
<P>In <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> this is &s;aying all Men are Born Knaves and
Cheats, and <HI>when in Societys</HI> they grow wor&s;e than they
were before, and that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are Rogues and not to be
Tru&s;ted with the Money.</P>
<P>This is very Unkind Gentlemen, and very Severe Lan|guage;
and were not the Government in <HI>England</HI> much
more Moderate, than your Humble Servant once found
them, I wonder that Gentleman is not yet Taught better
<PB N="31" REF="30">
Manners, if this Book be as Publick there, as 'tis here.</P>
<P>But the Principle on which the&s;e Gentlemen go, is not to
be Wondred at, &s;ince they &s;o plainly di&s;cover their aim to
be, that you &s;hould Tru&s;t any Body rather than <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And lea&s;t what I mean &s;hould be hard to gue&s;s at, the &s;ame
Gentleman explains it for me, when having fir&s;t told you
<HI>England</HI> is not to be tru&s;ted, nor can give you any Security;
he proceeds to tell you, who can: <HI>P.</HI> 27 &s;peaking of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
not making the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;uitable returns, and their &s;eeking
&s;ome where el&s;e, he adds,</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">This they can ea&s;ily do, either by publick Treaties
or private Bargains with their Neighbours.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>HOW SIR! private Bargains with Neighbours!
How can this be?&mdash;<Q REND="margQuotes">It is incident to the Nature of
Man, that neither private Men, far le&s;s Societies, will
perform their Bargains.</Q> <BIBL>State of the Contro. p. 22.</BIBL></P>
<P>Is not this a partiallity intolerable, and can I be cen&s;ur'd
for &s;aying, the plain meaning of this is, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are
Knaves, and will keep no Bargain with you; but the <HI>French</HI>
are hone&s;t Fellows, and you may make a Bargain with
them.</P>
<P>To carry on this rudene&s;s farther upon <HI>England,</HI> he ex|plains
him&s;elf&mdash;<Q REND="margQuotes">if any Man does believe that 513
Men who have no power to an&s;wer to, will compel
them&s;elves to pay a great Sum of Money&mdash;he has
more Faith than Experience or Judgment.</Q></P>
<P>This is not only Scurrilous and Indecent, but &s;o contrary
to Truth and Experience, that I could fill this tract with
precedents, in the very Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> which are
the People he reproaches, how they have retriv'd and &s;up|ported
the publick Faith, and e&s;tabli&s;ht the Credit of Par|liaments,
in paying great Sums of Money which they were
<PB N="32" REF="31">
under no Parliamentary obligation to Pay, and which they went
no farther for, than to examine the ju&s;tice of the
Demand in general, not their own particular Engagement;
and let any Man examine the Payment and Debentures to
the Army in <HI>Ireland;</HI> to the tran&s;port Service; the de|ficiencies
of Tallies on former Funds; and above all, the
payment of 600000 <HI>l.</HI> to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> for &s;o much advanc'd
on the Expedition of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> which no Parli|ament
was ever engaged for.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Men that by this Book are born Knaves,
will keep no Bargains, pay no Debts, and con&s;equently are
not fit to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>I leave all hone&s;t Men to judge, whether there is not
rea&s;on to per&s;uade Men to come with a &s;pirit of Union and
Confidence to a Treaty of this Nature, and whether the&s;e
&s;ort of Writers do not while they pretend to object again&s;t
the particulars of the Union, really drive at having no
Union at all.</P>
<P>I &s;hall de&s;cend but to one more Head of this learned Au|thor's
Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>having not room for it here,</HI> and that is a
mo&s;t wonderful new invented Sy&s;tem of Politicks &s;et down
in his 7th p. the la&s;t paragraph, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">By the Con&s;titution of Parliaments, the Laws are to
have their ri&s;e from the Will and Humour of the People,
&s;ignifyed by the Lords and Commons.&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>This is a &s;ugge&s;tion de&s;erves &s;ome Mirth were not the
Subject too Serious; and I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee that Gentle|man
or &s;ome body for him, &s;hew me by what part of the
Con&s;titution he will prove &s;uch a &s;ugge&s;tion.</P>
<P>Then he &s;ays, this humour of the People is &s;ignifyed by
the Lords and Commons, by which he gives the Lords and
Commons a great deal of Honour, that their bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="33" REF="32">
is only to &s;ignify the Will and Humour of the People</P>
<P>I hope their Lord&s;hips know their parliamentary Dignity
and the Commons their Office, better than this Gentle|man,
and &s;o I take no notice of that, but I hint it upon
this &s;core, <HI>for 'tis in it &s;elf too ridiculous to de&s;erve any
note:</HI> That the humours of the People, tho not the ri&s;e of
Laws, ought not to be rai&s;ed by any Indi&s;cretions again&s;t
the Laws, and that to po&s;&s;e&s;s their Minds with greater
Dangers and greater Apprehen&s;ions than are ju&s;tly before
them, cannot con&s;i&s;t with the care of their Quiet, any
more than with the Publick good.</P>
<P>The third and fourth Heads, <HI>viz.</HI> Civil Government
and Soveraignty remain, which I cannot enter upon here,
this Tract having run further on than I expected, if it
may be to the publick Service to Treat further on
the Subject, they may be Spoken to by them&s;elves,
when the Objections of the&s;e popular Authors again&s;t
the po&s;&s;ibility and &s;ecurity of a civil Coallition may meet
with &s;ome Reply; and perhaps there may not appear &s;uch
weight in them, as &s;ome People imagine.</P>
<P>The&s;e things I humbly recomend to the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation to
Con&s;ider of, I acknowledge, as a Stranger it may be Ob|jected,
why I Engage in this Matter; but as I have al|ways
Profe&s;t a more than Common Regard to this Nati|on,
and am not come Hither without &s;ome thought of Set|tling
among&s;t them, on the foot of Trade and Improve|ment;
E&s;pecially if the Union follow this Treaty: So I
have pre&s;um'd with all the Calmne&s;s and Re&s;pect I can, to
recommend Impartially, not the Imaginary, but the real
Advantages and Securities of this Union, and I &s;hould be
very &s;ory, if any Per&s;on &s;hould mi&s;take me.</P>
<P>Nor am I affraid of being &s;u&s;pected here, the Treatment
<PB N="34" REF="33">
I have met with from Parties and Power in my Native
Country, I think will Secure me from the Scandal
of being an Emi&s;&s;ary; to a Party I have no Intere&s;t to Pur|&s;ue,
no Gain to make, no Party to Serve; I &s;eek no Advan|tages
from the Union, other than in Common with my Na|tive
Country. I Contemn the Sugge&s;tion, as I Scorn the
Employment of an Emi&s;&s;ary, a Spy, or a Mercenary; my
Bu&s;&s;ine&s;s is known here: Which tending to Trade, Settle|ment
and general Improvement, I never purpo&s;ed to
Meddle in this Affair, and I hope I have done it &s;o as can
give no offence to any.</P>
<P>And as I take this occa&s;ion, to &s;peak of my own de&s;ign
of &s;ettling in this Kingdom, I de&s;ire to &s;peak one word to
the Citizens of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> I know, it is Sugge&s;ted, that
this Union &s;hall Prejudice this City, as it &s;hall Prevent the
Concour&s;e of your Nobility and Gentry, and con&s;equently
the Trade of the City.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved, that, in all the Books, Railling Pam|phlets
and Voluminous Arguments again&s;t the Union, not
one has ever yet Spoke a Word, about your Trade; but all
allow, you &s;hall be prodigious Gainers there.</P>
<P>Shall you then lo&s;e &s;omething of the Concour&s;e of your
Gentry here? Tho I do not grant that neither, Be not con|cern'd;
you will Gain it Ten fold, in the concour&s;e of
Strangers. Not this Authors Family only, but Hundreds
of Familys in <HI>England</HI> have their Eyes this way, to Engage
in your Commerce, Embark their Stocks in your Trade,
Manufactures and Fi&s;hing, Encrea&s;e your Shipping, and
Improve your Lands.</P>
<P>It is Impo&s;&s;ible, but your City mu&s;t Encrea&s;e the Commo|diou&s;ne&s;s
of your Harbour for Shipping, Qualify this City
only to be the Metropolis of this Kingdom in Trade, as well
<PB N="35" REF="34">
as the Capital for Re&s;ort; and who ever lives 20 Years
here, will &s;ee you Encrea&s;e in Wealth and People, and in
Spight of an Unhappy Situation, Encrea&s;e in Buildings too&mdash;Trade
will, and mu&s;t bring Inhabitants, and <HI>Edinburgh</HI>
and <HI>Leith</HI> will certainly be one City in a few Years.</P>
<P>Trades Men mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of this, and 'tis plain to the
Meane&s;t Capacity, a Fleet of Ships in your Road, and con|&s;tant
Import and Export, will bring another &s;ort of Con|cour&s;e
to the City than Ten Parliaments; and 'tis too plain
to need Examination.</P>
<P>You will then fall to Importing Naval Stores, Building
of Ships, Exporting your own Growth, and Importing
Forreign Goods; And how many Familys will immedi|ately
follow &s;uch Employments!</P>
<P>The Citizens and Common People of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> have
therefore the greate&s;t Cau&s;e in the World to wi&s;h for this
Union, as the only way to Redeem them from the Poverty
and Mi&s;ery, the pre&s;ent want of Trade has Reduc't them to.</P>
