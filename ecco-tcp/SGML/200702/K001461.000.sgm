<HEAD>Captain <HI>TOM's</HI> Remembrance to his Old Friends the MOBB of <HI>London, We&s;tmin&s;ter, Southwark,</HI>  and <HI>Wapping.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR &s;o I love &s;till to call you, on the Score of old Acquaintance and Friend&s;hip. I take this occa&s;ion to wi&s;h you Joy on the happy Deliverance of our good Queen from the bloody De&s;ign of the Popi&s;h A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in Count <HI>Gui&s;card,</HI> and on your own E&s;cape, at the &s;ame time, from being dragoon'd into Popery and Slavery, and becoming Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Water to the <HI>French</HI> King, and his Journy-Man the Pretender. For cou'd his Unchri&s;tian Maje&s;ty have once got the Collar on your Necks, and &s;addled you with the St. <HI>Germain</HI>'s Yonker; pray think, what a whipping Bill of Charges he'd have brought in, for nur&s;ing, boarding and tutoring that Babe of Grace? He has no Con&s;cience, you know, in his Demands; and a Child &s;o dutifully bred up as that is, wou'd not have had the Boldne&s;s to higgle with his Fo&s;ter-Father, and make him abate. No, he would have paid him to the full; and you mu&s;t have found where-withal to quit the Reckoning. And &s;o your &s;elves and your Sons mu&s;t have been chain'd to the Oar, and turn'd Swabbers under <HI>French</HI> Boat&s;wains, or been tran&s;ported into Foreign Countries, to have had your Brains knock'd out in the <HI>French</HI> King's Quarrel, to make him Monarch of all <HI>Europe.</HI> And your Wives and Daughters mu&s;t &s;ome of 'em have been common Strumpets to an Outlandi&s;h Jacobite Army, and others the hand|&s;ome&s;t of 'em have been mew'd up in Nunnerys for the U&s;e of Prie&s;ts and Fryars.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of &s;ub&s;tantial Beef and Pudding, your Stomachs wou'd have been taken down with brown husky Bread, and Herbs, and Rot-gutSoop. And for Sunday Apparel, you mu&s;t have been content with coar&s;e tatter'd Jackets, Canva&s;s Shirts, and Wooden Shoes. Thus, my Boys, you had for ever lo&s;t all the Plea&s;ures of <HI>Ea&s;ter, Whit&s;ontide,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tmas:</HI> No more Holy-day Clothes, no more Cakes and Ale, no more Beans and Bacon in the Summer: no more Plum-Porridge, Mince-Pyes, and roa&s;ted Sir-Loins in the Winter.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of being eas'd of Taxes, the Nation mu&s;t have been drain'd to &s;atisfy the <HI>French</HI> King for the Expences of the War. And this wou'd have been skrew'd up to One Hundred and Fifty Millions, at lea&s;t, be&s;ides the Charge of keeping a Standing Army at home, and Troops abroad, to help him to ruin the Allies. All this Mony, you may be &s;ure, cou'd never be rais'd without &s;elling the Land, and the Stock, and Shipping of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> And then what wou'd you have done for Imployment to get your Living?</P>
<P>The Popi&s;h Gimcracks and Idolatry mu&s;t have been &s;et up in your Chur|ches, your Benefices have been given to <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts, and the Chief of our Prote&s;tant Lords, Gentlemen, and Clergy mu&s;t have been murder'd in their Hou&s;es, butcher'd in the Streets, or pil'd up in <HI>Smithfield</HI> Bonfires, and you mu&s;t have carry'd Faggots to the Flames, or have been fry'd your &s;elves.
<PB REF="2" MS="y">
For 'tis impo&s;&s;ible the <HI>French</HI> and their St. <HI>Germain</HI>'s Nur&s;ling, and Popery and Slavery &s;hou'd be e&s;tabli&s;h'd in this I&s;land, without making a Wilderne&s;s of our Country, a Sacrifice of our Per&s;ons, and a Seizure of our E&s;tates.</P>
<P>Don't think, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I carry things too far here: Con&s;ider how the <HI>French</HI> King has laid wa&s;te his own Country, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>Arbitrary Power</HI> and <HI>Romi&s;h Bigotry</HI> in it. Call to mind how many Ma&s;&s;acres the Pa|pi&s;ts have made in <HI>France</HI> &s;ince the Reformation; how many hundred thou|&s;ands of his own Prote&s;tant Subjects that King has de&s;troy'd by Sword, Jails, Galleys and Bani&s;hment: And can you imagine that He and the Pre|tender wou'd u&s;e <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tants better? Con&s;ider how many Prote|&s;tant Countrys he has ruin'd in <HI>Germany,</HI> and forc'd the Inhabitants to beg their Bread in other Lands: and do you believe he wou'd be more favoura|ble to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> which has been the chief Hindrance of his becoming <HI>&V;niver&s;al Monarch?</HI> Call to mind how the late King <HI>James</HI> cut off your Noble Patriots, under the Notion of Plotters: how he &s;ent your Bi&s;hops to the Tower, fill'd your Armys, Univer&s;itys, and Councils with Papi&s;ts, and &s;et up a <HI>High Commi&s;&s;ion Court,</HI> to turn out the be&s;t of your Clergy. Re|member how he de&s;ign'd to govern you with a Standing Army, and impo&s;e a Sham-Succe&s;&s;or on you, to make <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery</HI> perpetual. How did you ble&s;s the Day when our late Glorious Deliverer the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> ar|riv'd, to re&s;cue you from all the&s;e Mi&s;erys? Did not your Hearts o'erflow with Joy? And did not you &s;hout him to Town with loud Acclama|tions, as the Saviour, under GOD, of our Church and State? Did not you then take Heart of Grace, and under my Conduct rout the <HI>Monks</HI> and <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> frighten the Standing Army of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> King, and force him and his <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Teagues to &s;camper? Did we not on all Occa&s;ions &s;tand by the Revolution, Heart and Hand, in which we and our Brethren all over the Kingdom, had &s;o great a Share? And yet, to &s;ee the Impudence of a late <HI>Gallimaufry</HI> of mercenary Tatterdemalions, they wou'd fain top it on the World, that, for&s;ooth, this &s;ame free-born Mob of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> had for|&s;worn their Principles, turn'd Tail, and become arrant Enemys to the Re|volution, and to the Memory of the Glorious Prince who was the In&s;tru|ment of it, and had run in with a Herd of <HI>Jacobites</HI> and <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> to rai&s;e Tumults and Rebellions.</P>
<P>But to prevent your being gull'd with any Flam-Storys they may buz in your Ears, pray con&s;ider, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> if <HI>Gui&s;card</HI> and his Fellow Bravo's had carry'd their Point, to murder the Queen and your be&s;t Patriots, and to fire the City, what Havock the Pretender and the D. of <HI>Berwick</HI> wou'd have made among you, with their <HI>French, Iri&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Cut-throats, while we had no Army to oppo&s;e them, nor any Prote&s;tant Prince to make Head again&s;t them?</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I hope the&s;e things have open'd your Eyes, and brought you to your Sen&s;es, and that you are convinc'd of the Errors &s;ome of your Number have been drawn into; and of the Knavery of tho&s;e who mi&s;led them, and began to act the Tragedy la&s;t Winter that was to have been con|cluded in this. Attend therefore to the Advice of your old Captain, who exhorts you to continue faithful in the Duty you owe to your Queen and Country, to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, to your Religion and Liberty, and to your Selves and Families, as becomes true <HI>Britains;</HI> and to be ever ready to defend all the&s;e again&s;t <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Jacobites,</HI> who are &s;till brewing their Plots, and endeavouring to di&s;grace and ruin the Authentick Mob of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> by fal&s;e, &s;purious Anti-Mobs of their own Ca&s;t. But I am confident you under&s;tand your &s;elves better than to be thus deceiv'd; and that you will take Care not to forfeit your former Honour, and the Favour of your old tru&s;ty Leader,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>TOM.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
