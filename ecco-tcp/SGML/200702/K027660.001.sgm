<P>WHEN I had fini&s;h'd my din|ner, and drank the King of France's health, to &s;atisfy my mind that I bore him no &s;pleen, but, on the contrary, high honour for the huma|nity of his temper&mdash;I ro&s;e up an inch taller for the accommodation.</P>
<P>&mdash;No&mdash;&s;aid I&mdash;the Bourbon is by no means a cruel race: they may be mi&s;led like other people; but there is a mildne&s;s in their blood. As I ac|knowledged this, I felt a &s;uffu&s;ion of a finer kind upon my cheek&mdash;more warm and friendly to man, than
<PB N="5" REF="24">
what Burgundy (at lea&s;t of two livres a bottle, which was &s;uch as I had been drinking) could have produced.</P>
<P>&mdash;Ju&s;t God! &s;aid I, kicking my portmanteau a&s;ide, what is there in this world's goods which &s;hould &s;harpen our &s;pirits, and make &s;o many kind-hearted brethren of us, fall out &s;o cruelly as we do by the way?</P>
<P>When man is at peace with man, how much lighter than a feather is the heavie&s;t of metals in his hand! he pulls out his pur&s;e, and holding it airily and uncompre&s;s'd, looks round him, as if he &s;ought for an object to &s;hare it with&mdash;In doing this, I felt

<P>I'm confident, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, I &s;hould have over&s;et her creed.</P>

<HEAD>THE MONK.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD &s;carce utter'd the words, when a poor monk of the order of St. Francis came into the room to beg &s;omething for his convent. No man cares to have his virtues the &s;port of contingencies&mdash;or one man may be generous, as another man is pui&s;&s;ant&mdash;<HI>&s;ed non, quo ad hanc</HI>&mdash;or be it as it may&mdash;for there is no regular rea&s;oning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours; they may depend upon the &s;ame cau&s;es, for ought I know, which influence the tides them&s;elves&mdash;'twould oft be no di&s;|credit
<PB N="9" REF="28">
to us, to &s;uppo&s;e it was &s;o: I'm &s;ure at lea&s;t for my&s;elf, that in many a ca&s;e I &s;hould be more highly &s;atisfied, to have it &s;aid by the world, <Q REND="inline">"I had had an affair with the moon, in which there was neither &s;in nor &s;hame,"</Q> than have it pa&s;s altogether as my own act and deed, wherein there was &s;o much of both.</P>
<P>&mdash;But be this as it may. The moment I ca&s;t my eyes upon him, I was predetermined not to give him a &s;ingle &s;ous; and accordingly I put my pur&s;e into my pocket&mdash;button'd it up&mdash;&s;et my&s;elf a little more upon my centre, and advanced up gravely to him: there was &s;omething, I fear, forbidding in my look: I have his
<PB N="10" REF="29">
figure this moment before my eyes, and think there was that in it which de&s;erved better.</P>
<P>The monk, as I judged from the break in his ton&s;ure, a few &s;catter'd white hairs upon his temples, being all that remained of it, might be about &s;eventy&mdash;but from his eyes, and that &s;ort of fire which was in them, which &s;eemed more temper'd by courte&s;y than years, could be no more than &s;ixty&mdash;Truth might lie between&mdash;He was certainly &s;ixty-five; and the general air of his counte|nance, notwith&s;tanding &s;omething &s;eem'd to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time, agreed to the account.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="30">
It was one of tho&s;e heads, which Guido has often painted&mdash;mild, pale&mdash;penetrating, free from all com|mon-place ideas of fat contented ig|norance looking downwards upon the earth&mdash;it look'd forwards; but look'd, as if it look'd at &s;omething beyond this world. How one of his order came by it, heaven above, who let it fall upon a monk's &s;houlders, be&s;t knows: but it would have &s;uited a Bramin, and had I met it upon the plains of Indo&s;tan, I had reverenced it.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of his outline may be given in a few &s;trokes; one might put it into the hands of any one to de&s;ign, for 'twas neither elegant or
<PB N="12" REF="31">
otherwi&s;e, but as character and ex|pre&s;&s;ion made it &s;o: it was a thin, &s;pare form, &s;omething above the common &s;ize, if it lo&s;t not the di&s;|tinction by a bend forwards in the figure&mdash;but it was the attitude of Intreaty; and as it now &s;tands pre|&s;ented to my imagination, it gain'd more than it lo&s;t by it.</P>
<P>When he had enter'd the room three paces, he &s;tood &s;till; and lay|ing his left hand upon his brea&s;t, (a &s;lender white &s;taff with which he journey'd being in his right)&mdash;when I had got clo&s;e up to him, he intro|duced him&s;elf with the little &s;tory of the wants of his convent, and the poverty of his order&mdash;and did it with
<PB N="13" REF="32">
&s;o &s;imple a grace&mdash;and &s;uch an air of deprecation was there in the whole ca&s;t of his look and figure&mdash;I was be|witch'd not to have been &s;truck with it&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;A better rea&s;on was, I had pre|determined not to give him a &s;ingle &s;ous.</P>

<P>WHEN a man is di&s;contented with him&s;elf, it has one ad|vantage however, that it puts him into an excellent frame of mind for making a bargain. Now there being no travelling through France and Italy without a chai&s;e&mdash;and nature generally prompting us to the thing we are fitte&s;t for, I walk'd out into the coach yard to buy or hire &s;ome|thing of that kind to my purpo&s;e: an old <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A chai&s;e, &s;o called in France, from its bolding but one per&s;on.</NOTE> De&s;obligeant in the furthe&s;t corner of the court, hit my fancy at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;o I in&s;tantly got into it,

<HEAD>PREFACE, IN THE DESOBLIGEANT.</HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t have been ob&s;erved by many a peripatetic philo&s;opher, That nature has &s;et up by her own unque&s;tionable authority certain boundaries and fences to circum|&s;cribe the di&s;content of man: &s;he has effected her purpo&s;e in the quiete&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t manner by laying him under almo&s;t in&s;uperable obligations to work out his ea&s;e, and to &s;u&s;tain his &s;ufferings at home. It is there only that &s;he has provided him with the mo&s;t &s;uitable objects to partake of his happine&s;s, and bear a part of that burden which in all countries and ages, has ever been too heavy
<PB N="23" REF="42">
for one pair of &s;houlders. 'Tis true we are endued with an imperfect power of &s;preading our happine&s;s &s;ometimes beyond <HI>her</HI> limits, but 'tis &s;o ordered, that from the want of languages, connections, and de|pendencies, and from the difference in education, cu&s;toms and habits, we lie under &s;o many impediments in communicating our &s;en&s;ations out of our own &s;phere, as often amount to a total impo&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>It will always follow from hence, that the balance of &s;entimental com|merce is always again&s;t the expa|triated adventurer: he mu&s;t buy what he has little occa&s;ion for at their own price&mdash;his conver&s;ation
<PB N="24" REF="43">
will &s;eldom be taken in exchange for theirs without a large di&s;count&mdash;and this, by the by, eternally driv|ing him into the hands of more equitable brokers for &s;uch conver|&s;ation as he can find, it requires no great &s;pirit of divination to gue&s;s at his party&mdash;</P>
<P>This brings me to my point; and naturally leads me (if the &s;ee-&s;aw of this <HI>De&s;obligeant</HI> will but let me get on) into the efficient as well as the final cau&s;es of travelling&mdash;</P>

<P>I am well aware, at the &s;ame time, as both my travels and ob&s;ervations will be altogether of a different ca&s;t from any of my fore-runners; that I might have in&s;i&s;ted upon a whole nitch entirely to my&s;elf&mdash;but I &s;hould break in upon the confines of the <HI>Vain</HI> Traveller, in wi&s;hing to draw attention towards me, till I have &s;ome better grounds for it, than the mere <HI>Novelty of my Ve|hicle.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="50">
It is &s;ufficient for my reader, if he has been a traveller him&s;elf, that with &s;tudy and reflection hereupon he may be able to determine his own place and rank in the cata|logue&mdash;it will be one &s;tep towards knowing him&s;elf; as it is great odds, but he retains &s;ome tincture and re&s;emblance, of what he imbibed or carried out, to the pre&s;ent hour.</P>
<P>The man who fir&s;t tran&s;planted the grape of Burgundy to the Cape of Good Hope (ob&s;erve he was a Dutch man) never dreamt of drink|ing the &s;ame wine at the Cape, that the &s;ame grape produced upon the French mountains&mdash;he was too phlegmatic for that&mdash;but undoubt|edly
<PB N="30" REF="51">
he expected to drink &s;ome &s;ort of vinous liquor; but whether good, bad, or indifferent&mdash;he knew enough of this world to know, that it did not depend upon his choice, but that what is generally called <HI>chance</HI> was to decide his &s;ucce&s;s: however, he hoped for the be&s;t; and in the&s;e hopes, by an intemperate confidence in the fortitude of his head, and the depth of his di&s;cretion, <HI>Mynheer</HI> might po&s;&s;ibly over&s;et both in his new vineyard; and by di&s;covering his nakedne&s;s, become a laughing|&s;tock to his people.</P>

<PB N="31" REF="52">
in pur&s;uit of knowledge and im|provements.</P>
<P>Knowledge and improvements are to be got by &s;ailing and po&s;ting for that purpo&s;e; but whether u&s;e|ful knowledge and real improve|ments, is all a lottery&mdash;and even where the adventurer is &s;ucce&s;sful, the acquired &s;tock mu&s;t be u&s;ed with caution and &s;obriety to turn to any profit&mdash;but as the chances run prodigiou&s;ly the other way both as to the acqui&s;ition and application, I am of opinion, That a man would act as wi&s;ely, if he could prevail upon him&s;elf, to live con|tented without foreign knowledge or foreign improvements, e&s;pecially
<PB N="32" REF="53">
if he lives in a country that has no ab&s;olute want of either&mdash;and indeed, much grief of heart has it oft and many a time co&s;t me, when I have ob&s;erved how many a foul &s;tep the inqui&s;itive Traveller has mea&s;ured to &s;ee &s;ights and look into di&s;co|veries; all which, as Sancho Panca &s;aid to Don Quixote, they might have &s;een dry-&s;hod at home.

De&s;&s;ein's coach|yard; and having &s;allied out from thence but a vampt-up bu&s;ine&s;s at the fir&s;t, though it had been twice taken to pieces on Mount Sennis, it had not profited much by its adven|tures&mdash;but by none &s;o little as the &s;tanding &s;o many months unpitied in the corner of Mon&s;.

<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>De&s;&s;ein</HI> had <HI>diabled</HI> the key above fifty times before he found out he had come with a wrong one in his hand: we were as impatient as him&s;elf to have it open'd; and &s;o

<P>The triumphs of a true feminine heart are &s;hort upon the&s;e di&s;comfi|tures. In a very few &s;econds &s;he laid her hand upon the cuff of my coat, in order to fini&s;h her reply; &s;o &s;ome way or other, God knows how, I regained my &s;ituation.</P>

together; but I remember, Mr. Shandy the elder, who accounted for nothing like any body el&s;e, in &s;peak|ing one evening of the&s;e matters, averred, that children, like other ani|mals, might be increa&s;ed almo&s;t to any &s;ize, provided they came right into the world; but the mi&s;ery was, the citizens of Paris were &s;o coop'd up, that they had not actually room enough to get them&mdash;I do not call it getting any thing, &s;aid he&mdash;'tis get|ting nothing&mdash;Nay, continued he, ri&s;ing in his argument, 'tis getting wor&s;e than nothing, when all you have got, after twenty or five and twenty years of the tendere&s;t care and mo&s;t nutritious aliment be&s;towed up|on

<P>As this is not a work of rea&s;oning, I leave the &s;olution as I found it, and content my&s;elf with the truth only of the remark, which is verified in every lane and by-lane of Paris. I was walking down that which leads from the Carou&s;al to the Palais Royal, and ob&s;erving a little boy in &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s at the &s;ide of the gutter, which ran down the middle of it, I took hold of his hand, and help'd him over. Upon turning up his face to look at him after, I perceived he was about

forty&mdash;Never mind, &s;aid I; &s;ome good body will do as much for me when I am ninety.</P>
<P>I feel &s;ome little principles within me, which incline me to be merciful towards this poor blighted part of my &s;pecies, who have neither &s;ize or &s;trength to get on in the world&mdash;I cannot bear to &s;ee one of them trod upon; and had &s;carce got &s;eated be|&s;ide my old French officer, ere the di&s;gu&s;t was exerci&s;ed, by &s;eeing the very thing happen under the box we &s;at in.</P>
<P>At the end of the orche&s;tra, and betwixt that and the fir&s;t &s;ide-box,
<PB N="193" REF="230">
there is a &s;mall e&s;planade left, where, when the hou&s;e is full, numbers of all ranks take &s;anctuary. Though you &s;tand, as in the parterre, you pay the &s;ame price as in the orche&s;tra. A poor defencele&s;s being of this order had got thru&s;t &s;ome how or other in|to this luckle&s;s place&mdash;the night was hot, and he was &s;urrounded by be|ings two feet and a half higher than him&s;elf. The dwarf &s;uffered inex|pre&s;&s;ibly on all &s;ides; but the thing which incommoded him mo&s;t, was a tall corpulent German, near &s;even feet high, who &s;tood directly betwixt him and all po&s;&s;ibility of his &s;eeing either the &s;tage or the actors. The poor dwarf did all he could to get a
<PB N="194" REF="231">
peep at what was going forwards, by &s;eeking for &s;ome little opening be|twixt the German's arm and his body, trying fir&s;t one &s;ide, then the other; but the German &s;tood &s;quare in the mo&s;t unaccommodating po&s;ture that can be imagined&mdash;the dwarf might as well have been placed at the bottom of the deepe&s;t draw-well in Paris; &s;o he civilly reach'd up his hand to the German's &s;leeve, and told him his di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;The German turn'd his head back, look'd down-upon him as Go|liah did upon David&mdash;and unfeel|ingly re&s;umed his po&s;ture.</P>
<P>I was ju&s;t then taking a pinch of &s;nuff out of my monk's little horn box&mdash;And how would thy meek and

courteous &s;pirit, my dear monk! &s;o temper'd to <HI>bear and forbear!</HI>&mdash;how &s;weetly would it have lent an ear to this poor &s;oul's complaint!</P>
<P>The old French officer &s;eeing me lift up my eyes with an emotion, as I made the apo&s;trophe, took the li|berty to a&s;k me what was the matter&mdash;I told him the &s;tory in three words; and added, how inhuman it was.</P>
<P>By this time the dwarf was driven to extremes, and in his fir&s;t tran&s;|ports, which are generally unrea&s;on|able, had told the German he would cut off his long queue with his knife&mdash;The German look'd back coolly,
<PB N="196" REF="233">
and told him he was welcome if he could reach it.</P>
<P>An injury &s;harpened by an in&s;ult, be it to who it will, makes every man of &s;entiment a party: I could have leaped out of the box to have redre&s;&s;ed it.&mdash;The old French officer did it with much le&s;s confu&s;ion; for leaning a little over, and nodding to a centinel, and pointing at the &s;ame time with his finger to the di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;the centinel made his way up to it.&mdash;There was no occa&s;ion to tell the grievance&mdash;the thing told it&s;elf; &s;o thru&s;ting back the German in&s;tantly with his mu&s;ket&mdash;he took the poor dwarf by the hand, and placed him

before him.&mdash;This is noble! &s;aid I, clapping my hands together&mdash;And yet you would not permit this, &s;aid the old officer, in England.</P>
<P>&mdash;In England, dear Sir, &s;aid I, <HI>we &s;it all at our ea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The old French officer would have &s;et me at unity with my&s;elf, in ca&s;e I had been at variance,&mdash;by &s;aying it was a <HI>bon mot</HI>&mdash;and as a <HI>bon mot</HI> is always worth &s;omething at Paris, he offered me a pinch of &s;nuff.</P>

<P>He told me, it was &s;ome poor Abbe in one of the upper loges, who he &s;uppo&s;ed had got planted perdu behind a couple of gri&s;&s;ets in

<P>The old French officer delivered this with an air of &s;uch candour and good &s;en&s;e, as coincided with my fir&s;t favourable impre&s;&s;ions of his charac|ter&mdash;I thought I loved the man; but I fear I mi&s;took the object&mdash;'twas my own way of thinking&mdash;the dif|ference was, I could not have ex|pre&s;&s;ed it half &s;o well.</P>
