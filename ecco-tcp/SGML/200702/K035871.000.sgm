<HEAD>THE
CASE
OF
Di&s;&s;enters, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Spaniards</HI> u&s;e to glory in the wide Extent,
and pure Catholici&s;m, of their Dominion; the
<HI>Italians,</HI> from a Preten&s;ion of Superior Politene&s;s
and Sagacity, contemn all Tramontanes; the Mo|dern
<HI>French</HI> make to them&s;elves a daily Triumph of the
Succe&s;&s;es of their Grand Monarch; why may not my
Countrymen as well exult, that the Laws, by which we
are governed, are no other than &s;uch, as our &s;elves, by a
due Repre&s;entative, have cho&s;en? Oh happy <HI>England!</HI>
May thy People e&s;teem, as it de&s;erves, a Benefit &s;o &s;ingu|lar;
may that Noble Repre&s;entative of thine, called to
be Guardians of this Ble&s;&s;ing, never want Fore&s;ight to
di&s;cover, and Prudence to prevent, the Dangers which may
ari&s;e to threaten it.</P>
<P>The ordinary Method with us is well known to be,
that the Addition of new Laws, or Amendment of old ones,
are propo&s;ed fir&s;t by the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> and im|mediately
publick Notice given when the &s;ame are to
come under a &s;olemn Debate; which being &s;everal times
adjourn'd, there ari&s;es Opportunity &s;ufficient, for the Sub|jects
from all Parts of the Kingdom, to communicate to the
re&s;pective Members of Parliament, their Opinion &s;everally
<PB N="6" REF="4">
thereupon; &s;o that in this re&s;pect &s;eldom any thing of
Importance is concluded concerning the good People of
<HI>England,</HI> without their own tacit Con&s;ent at lea&s;t, over
and above the Benefit of their being repre&s;ented in com|mon.
Such being then the Ca&s;e, we cannot celebrate
enough our Happine&s;s; we may ba&s;ely overlook, but once
to lo&s;e it, would be Mi&s;ery to us beyond Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>'Tis frequent moreover, for our Laws to be made tem|porary
fir&s;t, till the Experiment of a few Years has re|commended
them for perpetual. As for tho&s;e of the
highe&s;t Concern, when the Benefits or Effects are liable
to Doubt, we have &s;een &s;ome Bills undergo the Scrutiny
of &s;everal &s;ucceeding Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament before they
pa&s;&s;ed the Signature of Authority. Sometimes al&s;o our
Courts of Legi&s;lature, when the Inducements and Rea|&s;ons
of a Bill were not obvious to common Eyes, or
at lea&s;t liable to Mi&s;con&s;truction, have thought good to
lay the &s;ame before the Publick, that their tender Regards
of general Emolument might the better appear.</P>
<P>Having ob&s;erv'd various Methods of our Propitious Le|gi&s;lature,
an In&s;tance of &s;everal of them, but more e&s;pe|cially
the latter, we are here to con&s;ider, I mean the late
Bill for Preventing Occa&s;ional Conformity, which was &s;o
differently apprehended in the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament,
as no Debates during it were able to reconcile; but that
Matter is of &s;uch Concern, that the Proceedings thereupon
being printed by Authority, it &s;eems not unworthy eve|ry
true Lover of his Country, to put the &s;ame into the be&s;t
Light po&s;&s;ible, in order to frame a right Judgment, how a
Bill like unto that (if at any time hereafter &s;uch &s;hould
be propo&s;ed) may affect the Commonweal; &s;eeing the O|pinion
which &s;hall prevail thereof, there can be no doubt,
will be duly weighed by our Repre&s;entees; and becau&s;e
one Intention of our Lawgivers, in publi&s;hing the Ac|count
of their Proceedings upon that Bill, might be (not
improbably) the better to collect the common Judgment
on it, a De&s;ire to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant unto that, with a Concern
le&s;t unhappy Animo&s;ities &s;hould grow among us, did en|gage
me to draw into a clear and familiar Method of Di&s;|cour&s;e,
what is very obvious touching that Matter.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="5">
The Bill, which is the de&s;igned Theme of what follows,
I under&s;tand &s;uch as it pa&s;&s;ed la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion the Hou&s;e of
Commons, with the &s;everal Amendments agreed afterwards,
touching which, that my Argument may be the more di|&s;tinct,
I take the Liberty to dige&s;t it under Three Heads,
which are ea&s;ily di&s;cernable on reading the &s;aid Bill, <HI>viz.</HI>
The Preamble, Extent, and Penalties, due Reference being
had thereto; however, the&s;e few things ought to be pre|mi&s;ed,
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the whole of it is Prudential and Politi|cal,
not cen&s;uring directly the Per&s;ons and Cau&s;e of the
Di&s;&s;enters beyond the Point of bearing Offices, nor inter|dicting
any to be pre&s;ent at their A&s;&s;emblies, except &s;uch
as are engaged in the Magi&s;tracy, or Places of Tru&s;t, there|by
leaving the Matter of Con&s;cience as it &s;tood before.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> The Communion of the Lord's Supper is con&s;i|dered
herein as a Di&s;crimination meerly civil; &s;o that tho'
Papi&s;ts and Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters are excluded from Offices
thereby, yet is there no Provi&s;ion by the Law to render the
&s;ame a Barr to the Prophane and Scandalous; which is a
Con&s;ideration &s;eems to concern the Honour of the Church
of <HI>England,</HI> as well as the good Admini&s;tration of the &s;e|veral
Tru&s;ts, to which it initiates: But becau&s;e, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Se|veral
Ca&s;es in Religion might be reducible under the Sub|ject
of this Bill, I &s;hall comply with the obvious Intenti|on
of our Lawgivers, and confine my Di&s;cour&s;e as much
as may be to a Secular Vein. To proceed therefore to the
Bill.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Touching the Preamble of it, it were not ea&s;ie, per|adventure,
in &s;o few Words, for our Supreme Governors
to have given more Satisfaction to &s;crupulous Con&s;ciences
than in the Religious Declaration, that &s;erves as an Introdu|ction
here; becau&s;e therein the Sen&s;e of the pre&s;ent Go|vernment
appears, that tho&s;e Severities, under which the
Di&s;&s;enters groaned, before the late Act of Indulgence, <HI>were
then to be deem'd Per&s;ecution for Con&s;cience &s;ake;</HI> under
which Acceptation it is, that their Exemption from them
for the future (unle&s;s new Matter of Secular Offence to
the Government ari&s;es) is to &s;tand upon Foundations no
le&s;s &s;afe, than <HI>the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and
particularly the Doctrine of the Church of</HI> England. This
<PB N="8" REF="6">
is the highe&s;t Atte&s;tation can be, that the Di&s;&s;enters
are no longer to be look'd upon <HI>obnoxious to the Church
and State, or chargeable with Schi&s;m, Sedition and Rebelli|on,</HI>
as the former Laws (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ow &s;u&s;pended) did in&s;i&s;t they
were; &s;o that the Rea&s;on given by tho&s;e Laws cea&s;ing,
<HI>and &s;ince it is on all Hands agreed, great Advantages have
accrued from the Act of Indulgence,</HI> they may henceforth
expect, with the re&s;t of their Fellow-Subjects, to partake
the Serenity and Benignity of a Government, which in all
other things ever was, and now is, the mo&s;t clement under
the Sun. Thus is the Bond of engaging Goodne&s;s laid upon
them for ever; &s;o that as &s;ince the late Glorious Revolu|tion
they are found equally affectionate as others, to the
Intere&s;ts and Settlement of the Crown, all the former &s;tig|matizing
Brands upon them are done away.</P>
<P><HI>As to the Recital of the pre&s;ent State of Law, which fol|lows
the Religious Declaration,</HI> (that it provides already,
every Per&s;on admitted into any Office, &s;hould be conforma|ble
to the Church) <HI>the Words of it cannot be taken in the
&s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e,</HI> there being many Offices and Employments,
to which Per&s;ons have been, and may be now, admitted,
without lying under an Obligation to receive the Sacrament,
or be conformable on that Account: For in&s;tance, Offices of
Inheritance, and in the Fore&s;ts, Non-Commi&s;&s;ion Offices in the
Fleet, with many more; <HI>therefore what is a&s;&s;erted in this
Paragraph in the general, we mu&s;t under&s;tand</HI> to relate to
&s;uch Per&s;ons and Offices only as are &s;ub&s;equently mention'd
in the Bill; but if tho&s;e who break the Intention of a Law,
break the Law, it were fit and de&s;ireable that no Words
(if po&s;&s;ible) might be u&s;ed in any, which in the Sequel may
lead Men into Mi&s;takes, touching that Intention.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Clau&s;e of the Preamble gives a very ju&s;t De&s;crip|tion
of the Ca&s;e, which the Bill is de&s;igned to bring a Re|medy
for; that is to &s;ay, <HI>No Man ordinarily frequenting
private Meetings, &s;hould qualifie him&s;elf for an Office, by re|ceiving
only on that Account the Sacrament with the Church.</HI>
Now that nothing however be under&s;tood beyond the natu|ral
Sen&s;e of the Words thereof, I take the&s;e Two Things
not to be ab&s;olutely concluded in them. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That whil&s;t
Conforming only for a Place has a Brand of Scandal affixed
<PB N="9" REF="7">
on it; yet it does not follow that Occa&s;ional Conformity
otherwi&s;e (without &s;uch De&s;ign) ought to be reproach'd; for
as to &s;uch Per&s;ons, who join them&s;elves to their Chri&s;tian So|cieties
&s;everally, as taking the Conduct of them to be mo&s;t
agreeable to the Word of God, and becau&s;e it plea&s;es the
Soveraign Spirit of Grace to co-operate more evidently up|on
them therein, for &s;uch to go &s;ometimes to a Divine
Service, different from what they frequent and chu&s;e, is
an Expre&s;&s;ion of Charity to others, and ought not therefore
to be blamed. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It can no Ways be taken for con|cluded,
that a Cen&s;ure upon the Conformity in this Bill
mention'd, does imply <HI>going to a Meeting to be</HI> malum in
&s;e, <HI>or &s;avouring of Faction, or Criminal, Illegal, and Schi&s;|matical,</HI>
as the &s;uperceded Laws did con&s;tantly a&s;&s;ert; for
the mention of it, as allowed by Law, does demon&s;trate
the contrary; the manife&s;t and primary Purpo&s;e of this
Bill being rather to keep Di&s;&s;enters from the Church,
than others from a Meeting; however, the mutual Free|dom
in this Point, to the great Glory of our Times, &s;a|vours
of that charitable Moderation, &s;o remarkably emi|nent
in the Primitive Ages of Chri&s;tianity, as to occa&s;ion
tho&s;e Univer&s;al Laws in the <HI>Creed,</HI> for every one <HI>to be|lieve
the Holy Catholick Church, and the Communion of
Saints.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The enacting Part of this Bill, I term the
Extent of it, becau&s;e it de&s;cribes both the Crime and the
Offices thereby to be affected, whereof di&s;tinctly; fir&s;t
then for the Crime, the Definition of it herein is the &s;ame
with that <HI>in Two &s;everal Acts, to prevent and &s;uppre&s;s
Seditious Conventicles;</HI> and 16 and 22 <HI>Car.</HI> II. &s;o that
what was criminal by them to all Per&s;ons, becomes a|gain
&s;o by this Bill to tho&s;e in Office; the Qualifica|tion
for Offices by expre&s;s Terms of Law required at
pre&s;ent, is, in this re&s;pect, no more than once previou&s;ly
to receive the Sacrament with the Church; but the Con|formity
which would be required herein, is, (be&s;ides that) <HI>ne|ver,
after once taking an Office, to be pre&s;ent at any Conventi|cle
or Meeting, under Colour or Pretence of any Exerci&s;e of Re|ligion,
in other manner than according to the Liturgy and Pra|ctice
of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>where Five (more than the Family)
<PB N="10" REF="8">
&s;hall be.</HI> This is a &s;ort of Qualification for Offices widely
different (as any may &s;ee) from what the Law requires
now; and we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that throughout the Bill &s;uch
Terms are only u&s;ed as have been commonly appropriated
to Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters; however, to be pre&s;ent at Ma&s;s is
tacitly included.</P>
<P>We do not go about to intimate, That the Injunctions of
the Law at pre&s;ent, <HI>to receive the Sacrament according
to the Rites and U&s;age of the Church,</HI> do not in the pri|mary
Meaning of them imply, that the Per&s;ons ought to
be of that Communion; however, none can deny, but they
will very well bear a larger Sence al&s;o; whereby none
ought to be excluded Offices, who can give a publick Te|&s;timony
they e&s;teem a Communion with the Church law|ful;
which latter Acceptation of the Laws, though the
generality of Di&s;&s;enters &s;tand Excluded by it, has all along,
for 40 Years pa&s;t, brought into the Service of the Go|vernment
(without very vi&s;ible, ruinous, Effects) no incon&s;i|derable
Number of Men, whom the propo&s;ed Bill in all
Appearance would finally render incapable.</P>
<P>Whether it may be for the publick Benefit any longer
to &s;uffer the &s;ame Latitude in reference to Di&s;&s;enters,
belongs only to the Supreme Powers to judge; but grant|ing
here that it were not, we do with all Humility of|fer
to Con&s;ideration, whether <HI>gentler Methods be not more
agreeable to the Engli&s;h Temper, Con&s;titution of Govern|ment;
nay, and the Intere&s;t of State, &s;o the End may be
duly attained;</HI> in the Ca&s;e then before us, if the Govern|ment
for Example &s;hould require from the e&s;tabli&s;h'd
Church, in&s;tead of one previous Communion (which is all
in the Law expre&s;s'd) that Men in Office &s;hould attend
Four times Yearly, or oftner, at the Sacrament, would it
not be equal Security to the State, and greatly for the
Honour of the Church, but give no Matter of Offence
or Jealou&s;ie to Di&s;&s;enters? Whereas if the Qualification
for Offices is to con&s;i&s;t not &s;o much in frequent and de|vout
Attendance on the publick Celebrations, as in a Di|&s;tance
and Aver&s;ion to Di&s;&s;enters, <HI>this cannot but mini&s;ter
ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Fear, that tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies, at which once to be
<PB N="11" REF="9">
pre&s;ent, expo&s;es to &s;o great a Cen&s;ure, are not likely to
continue long allowed by Law.</HI></P>
<P>No Man can doubt but a Cen&s;ure of this kind would
prove <HI>a Notorious Mark of Infamy upon the A&s;&s;emblies of
Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and in that re&s;pect would affect them beyond
the Ca&s;e of Officers; and the revived Definition of a Con|venticle,
being <HI>under the Pretence and Colour of the Exer|ci&s;e
of Religion,</HI> (it de&s;erves to be con&s;ider'd) whether it
might not be con&s;trued to allude to, and imply, &s;omewhat
of tho&s;e dangerous Practices the Su&s;pended Laws have
connected with the &s;aid Definition; but there are other
obvious Inconveniencies in this new Method of Qualifica|tion,
for it would expo&s;e more a great deal than the pre|&s;ent
Way (as will be &s;hewn el&s;ewhere) to the predatory
Mercy of Informers; it debarrs the common natural Re|&s;pects
of Relations, in Bapti&s;ms, Funeral Sermons, and
the like: <HI>It ca&s;ts a hazardous Di&s;couragement upon Family
Prayer, whereat often, among Per&s;ons of Quality, and &s;ome|times
others, more than Five may happen to be pre&s;ent;
and it brings all Foreign Churches under a Cen&s;ure too;
whereas the Act of Uniformity provides, that the Penalties
thereof &s;hould not extend to any Reformed Churches of
Aliens, allowed, or to be allowed, by His Maje&s;ty or His
Succe&s;&s;ors; &s;ome &s;uch have &s;ince had Encouragement for
their Settlement from Parliament, and have proved bene|ficial
in Manufactures to this Kingdom, toward which
their Liberty of Con&s;cience, without Reflection, has not a
little contributed.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd Di&s;tinction I have made of the Extent (or
enacting Part, of this Bill) is of the Offices intended by it
to be affected, which clearly falls under a twofold Defi|nition,
one the &s;ame with that in the Act, 25 <HI>Car.</HI> II. <HI>For
preventing Dangers which may happen from Popi&s;h Recu|&s;ants;</HI>
the other of the 13 of <HI>Car.</HI> II. <HI>For well governing
and regulating Corporations.</HI> Now becau&s;e this &s;eems the
mo&s;t tender and &s;en&s;ible Part of the Bill, mo&s;t liable to
Mi&s;take, and upon the right Apprehen&s;ion whereof our
Judgment of the whole mu&s;t very much depend; before
I de&s;cend into a Di&s;qui&s;ition of it, I beg leave to deviate
<PB N="12" REF="10">
a little from the ju&s;t Method of Di&s;cour&s;e; and therefore
before I endeavour to prove what the Bill, under this Head,
would have enacted&mdash;new, I will fir&s;t lay down and
con&s;ider the Rea&s;ons commonly alledg'd, why the &s;ame
ought to be.</P>
<P>What is commonly alledg'd, as the Ground of the new
Provi&s;ions in this Bill, amounts to thus much; that a
National Church being ab&s;olutely needful to a Govern|ment,
the only effectual Way to pre&s;erve it, is by keep|ing
the Civil Power in the Hands of &s;uch who&s;e Pra|ctice
and Principles are agreeable thereto; and that this
is equally nece&s;&s;ary to the Safety and Peace of the State
likewi&s;e; but &s;ay they, the pre&s;ent Laws proving too
weak to &s;ecure tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, becau&s;e they are eluded
by Occa&s;ional Conformity, therefore there wants &s;ome new
Expedients to &s;upport them; the&s;e Maxims we can readily
grant; &s;o far as the Security and Peace of the State ap|pear
undoubtedly concern'd, &s;o much is allowed on all
Hands for inconte&s;tible; but the Matter in que&s;tion be|fore
us &s;eems to be, whether Occa&s;ional Conformity of
Di&s;&s;enters has really endanger'd the Safety, and violated
the Peace, of Church and State? Or has any Principles in
it di&s;agreeable therewith? Which Matter cannot yet be
taken for concluded, as the Proceedings of Parliament
publi&s;h'd do evince, and whereof therefore the pre&s;ent
Juncture and Occa&s;ion gives Liberty to &s;peak.</P>
<P>In order to examine then this Matter aright, we think
proper to di&s;tingui&s;h the Relation which the Occa&s;ional
Conformity of Di&s;&s;enters may bear to the Church and
State &s;everally; fir&s;t therefore in Reference to the State,
<HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> (it may be agreed to us) <HI>is no new
thing, but even Coaeval with the Act of Uniformity it
&s;elf; &s;o that in 40 Years Experience, if it were evi|dent
that Injuries to the Peace of the Government had
aro&s;e thence, how came it to pa&s;s they &s;hould be overlookt
&s;o long?</HI> But while &s;everal Ways were taken to enjoin
Conformity, how Occa&s;ional &s;oever, it was in no kind
before made Penal to approve it, tho' thereby Offices
were attained; after &s;uch a large Atte&s;tation from Fact,
<PB N="13" REF="11">
it would be needle&s;s to &s;ay, Occa&s;ional Conformity of
Di&s;&s;enters has in it &s;elf no Principles dangerous to the
Peace of the Government, if there were not another
&s;ort of Conformity which does ob&s;tinately maintain &s;uch
as withdraw Men from their Allegiance to Her Gracious
Maje&s;ty, and from all Re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of the Crown; but as to Principles, further than
is obvious from Practice, it is not my proper Province to
di&s;cour&s;e, that being already &s;ufficiently treated of by Di|vines.</P>
<P>If
the Time pa&s;t has not produced a Nece&s;&s;ity of any
new Provi&s;ion again&s;t Accidental or Occa&s;ional Conformi|ty,
I think we may be confident the pre&s;ent much le&s;s
does; for if the Laws already in being do intend that
Men in Office &s;hould be entirely conformable, Her Gra|cious
Maje&s;ty has a&s;&s;ured all the World there can be no
Danger from Occa&s;ional Conformity in this Au&s;picious
Reign, by the&s;e Words of Her la&s;t Speech to the Parliament;
<HI>I &s;hall always make it my particular Care to Encourage
and Maintain this Church as by Law e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and eve|ry
the lea&s;t Member of it, in all their Ju&s;t Rights and
Priviledges.</HI> And now having deliver'd my Sentiment,
upon Ob&s;ervations of the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent Time, to go
further would be to wade into the Politicks beyond my
Depth. I can &s;ay nothing certain of Futurity; but &s;ince
the Di&s;&s;enters are known, beyond doubt, to be very cor|dially
affected to the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, methinks
whatever Qualifications may be judged requi&s;ite for Pla|ces
of Magi&s;tracy and Publick Tru&s;t, they may well ex|pect
(beyond a Provi&s;ion for that) no Hard&s;hips will be
laid upon them now.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> To con&s;ider Occa&s;ional Conformity in Reference
to the Church, it might &s;uffice to &s;ay, the Affairs of it
(di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the State) do no Ways lye un|der
the Cognizance of &s;uch, whom that may ve&s;t with
Government; but for what properly concerns the Honour
and Welfare of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> the fir&s;t Words
of this Bill do imply, that her greate&s;t Glory con&s;i&s;ts in
the Character of Moderation, Sweetne&s;s, and Charity,
<PB N="14" REF="12">
truly Chri&s;tian and Apo&s;tolick, and very ju&s;tly, for this
would recommend her to all the Reformed Churches of
<HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> as worthy to be acknowledg'd their Chief
and Be&s;t. <HI>In the Reign of Queen</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>all the Pa|pi&s;ts
in</HI> England <HI>came to Church, and were Occa&s;ional Con|formi&s;ts,
yet the Government was not Unea&s;ie, and in Dan|ger,
by it; but the Pope fearing what that was like &s;oon
to grow to, put a Stop to it by Bull, and the Church of</HI>
Rome <HI>does generally to this Day encourage every thing
like to Occa&s;ional Conformity of Prote&s;tants; and the Ef|fects
&s;hew they are in the right, and gain their Ends by
it.</HI> In like manner, can it be thought that the Church
has <HI>gained from any &s;ort of the Di&s;&s;enters among us, as
from tho&s;e who have allowed and practiced an Occa&s;ional
Conformity with her? Has &s;he not, by permitting it, obtained
many u&s;eful and worthy Members? Does not the Practice
of it weaken the Di&s;&s;enters, and encrea&s;e her Reputation
and Authority?</HI> Where then has been the Damage to
the Church from Occa&s;ional Conformity? It would be
difficult to &s;hew what Security, Honour or Intere&s;t, &s;he
ha&s;t lo&s;t, during the greate&s;t Indulgence to Di&s;&s;enters in
the late Reign, of any thing &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd before that
time, during the un&s;peakable Sufferings of others; there|fore
it mu&s;t be an Acce&s;&s;ion of Honour and Safety unto
her, that &s;he is now by Clemency become reverenced of
tho&s;e who formerly were &s;u&s;pected for her Enemies.</P>
<P>Having thus made Enquiry, what Rea&s;on there is to
apprehend that the Safety of the Church and State has
been, or is, endanger'd by the Latitude allowed to Di&s;|&s;enters,
from the pre&s;ent Condition of the Laws; I pro|ceed,
according to promi&s;e, to enquire what Alteration
would ari&s;e on the Head of Offices from the Bill now
under Con&s;ideration; which I &s;hall do in Two Denomi|nations
of them; I mean tho&s;e comprehended in the Te&s;t
Act, and tho&s;e peculiarly affected by that for regulating
Corporations; premi&s;ing here only, that the Offices of
the latter &s;ort, which do directly fall within the Te&s;t,
I judge better to con&s;ider in that Denomination, becau&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="13">
thereby what remains will be more di&s;tinct and intelli|gible,
when we handle it apart.</P>
<P><HI>1&s;t,</HI> For the Te&s;t Clau&s;e, which is the former in this
part of the Bill, without reciting the Words of it, we
may be allowed to &s;ay upon good Authority, <HI>That ma|nife&s;tly
and indi&s;putably it does comprehend all the con&s;i|derable
Offices and Imployments of Publick Tru&s;t in the
Kingdom, in which the Security of the Government may
be concerned; the Experience of 30 Years pa&s;t has ju&s;ti|fied
the Mea&s;ures taken by that Law, that it is exten|&s;ive
enough as to the &s;everal &s;orts of Offices for Publick
Security; the Terms of it are expre&s;s, clear, and univer|&s;ally,
under&s;tood, without any Uncertainty as to what Im|ployments
it relates, which is not &s;o evident in tho&s;e of
the Corporation Act; the &s;aid Act includes all Offices of
Magi&s;tracy, in e&s;pecial, as well within Corporations as
without; and at the enacting of it there was little Regard
had to the Act for Regulating Corporations, becau&s;e a
more effectual Security to the Church was given hereby.</HI>
It cannot be taxed as in&s;ufficient to compa&s;s the End de|&s;igned
by it, which was expre&s;ly to prevent Dangers
that might happen from Popi&s;h Recu&s;ants, and to ex|clude
from Offices all others who will not take the
Sacrament according to the U&s;age of the Church e&s;ta|bli&s;ht.
After this Manner, and in a due Medium, as would
be ea&s;ie in another &s;ort of Di&s;cour&s;e, to make appear the
Safety and Peace of Church and State, have been fully
provided for; nor have the Mea&s;ures of it to procure
tho&s;e been any Ways (in particular the Penalties) found
deficient.</P>
<P>This Act being &s;o exten&s;ive and compleat, that it
reaches whatever Offices concern the Safety of the Go|vernment,
and is not deficient in any Means to attain
its End. If Dangers &s;hould from Occa&s;ional Conformity
ari&s;e, it were ea&s;ie at any time to enjoin &s;uch Frequen|cy
at the Publick Offices of the Church, as might deno|minate
an entire Conformi&s;t, without a Brand upon &s;epa|rate
A&s;&s;emblies, to rai&s;e again the Seeds of Fatal Ani|mo&s;ities;
but as to the Places of Magi&s;tracy and Pub|lick
<PB N="16" REF="14">
Tru&s;t, already comprehended in the Te&s;t, as they
concern the Security of State much more, &s;o they affect
the Body of Di&s;&s;enters much le&s;s, than tho&s;e in the Cor|porations;
for which Cau&s;e, what is to be &s;aid in their
Behalf is more properly referr'd to that Head. It would al&s;o
be very unbecoming any &s;ort of Men to enter into Ar|gument
with their Governors upon tho&s;e high Points,
which are &s;o ab&s;olutely in the Legi&s;lature to judge of
and determine; 'tis not fit for me &s;o much as to offer an
Opinion: An Explanation of the Te&s;t, more to the Di&s;ad|vantage
of Di&s;&s;enters, might indeed deprive &s;everal of
&s;ome profitable Places, in the Royal Hou&s;hold, the Ex|chequer,
the Navy, the Exci&s;e, the Cu&s;toms, and el&s;e|where;
but the Magi&s;tracy of the City would be the
chief Import of this Matter; concerning which, what
Inconveniences have aro&s;e to the Government from the
Cour&s;e of Things for near 20 Years pa&s;t there, and how
an Alteration in it will any Ways tend to the Advantage
of the State, is equally to me undi&s;cernable; but this I
do adventure to &s;ay, that if Men, whom the Negative
Qualification of this Bill would have rendred incapable
to &s;erve in &s;uch Offices, &s;hould have been finable never|thele&s;s
for not &s;erving them, and that <HI>toties quoties,</HI> as
the Humour of the World might lead, that &s;ort of Per|&s;ecution
might po&s;&s;ibly ri&s;e pretty high.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> It remains to examine what the propo&s;ed Bill
would have introduced <HI>de novo,</HI> upon the Head of the
Corporation Act di&s;tinctly; the Clau&s;e whereof, expre&s;&s;ive
of the Offices it would affect, is in the&s;e Words: <HI>Any
Mayor, Alderman, Recorder, Bayliff, Town-Clerk, Common-Coun|cil-man,
or other Per&s;on, bearing any Office of Magi&s;tracy,
or Places, or Tru&s;ts, or other Imployment, relating to, or
concerning, the Government of the re&s;pective Cities, Cor|porations,
Boroughs, Cinque-Ports, and their Members, and
other Port-Towns.</HI> As to &s;o much hereof as concerns
Magi&s;tracy, the Te&s;t Act having better provided, my Di&s;|cour&s;e
is to be henceforth re&s;trained to what herein
touches only the Intrin&s;ick and Inferior Imployments, re|lating
to the &s;everal Boroughs re&s;pectively, wherein the
<PB N="17" REF="15">
Security of the Church and State does not &s;eem to be
much concerned.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;t of our Laws have &s;prung from the evident Nece&s;&s;ities
of the Times, and &s;o came in as Remedies to the pro|per
Di&s;tempers of them, which is in none more apparent
than this of the Corporations the</HI> 13. Car. II. Tho&s;e de|plorable
Confu&s;ions which had tormented the Nation, for
nigh 20 Years preceeding, lay fre&s;h upon the Minds of the
Parliament, when that Act was made; and 'tis evident
that nothing but &s;o extraordinary a Juncture could have
excu&s;ed &s;ome Parts of it: Nay, it was principally found|ed
upon Rea&s;ons &s;o peculiar to that time, they are &s;ar
from being pertinent to ours, for there is now no &s;olemn
League and Covenant needs to be renounced; the Decla|ration
in it, that it is not lawful, upon any Pretence what|&s;oever,
to take up Arms again&s;t the King, and of Abhor|rence
of that traiterous Po&s;ition of doing &s;o by his Autho|rity
again&s;t his Per&s;on, or tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ion'd by him,
(<HI>which was the Touch&s;tone of the &s;aid Act and Times</HI>)
is now utterly abrogated, and no Per&s;on henceforth can be
obliged to take the &s;ame, as appears in the Act <HI>Primo W.</HI>
and <HI>M.</HI> for appointing other Oaths; the Oaths of Supre|macy
and Allegiance therein are al&s;o chang'd; the Power
given by it to the Crown, to Con&s;titute Commi&s;&s;ioners for
Two Years to turn out, and put in the Corporation Offi|cers
<HI>ad libitum,</HI> though they were conformable to the Qua|lifications
required by the Act, was an Extravagance the
pre&s;ent Age would &s;carce approve; the Preamble &s;peaks
of it as a thing too well known, that notwith&s;tanding His
Maje&s;ties unparallell'd Goodne&s;s, in pardoning what was
pa&s;t, there were many evil Spirits &s;till working. <HI>We do
not therefore herein go about to cen&s;ure the Mea&s;ures of that
Act, as they were &s;uted to the Juncture; but as the
Rea&s;ons, the Jealou&s;ies and Foundations, whereon that
Act was built, were &s;o appropriate to that time, that the &s;e|veral
Parts of it here above mention'd (as un&s;uitable to
any other) are &s;ince aboli&s;h'd. It is pretty clear that the
primary Intent thereof had its full and due Effect from
the Commi&s;&s;ioners Power, and the Impo&s;ition of renoun|cing
<PB N="18" REF="16">
the Covenant and Declaration of Fidelity,</HI> for there
was little regard had to it at the time that a more effectual
Security to the Church was provided by the Te&s;t.</P>
<P>We come therefore to con&s;ider in the next Place, what
remains yet unrazed of that Act in 13. <HI>Car.</HI> II. <HI>for well
governing and regulating Corporations;</HI> and then will clear|ly
be di&s;cern'd what the propo&s;ed Bill would have &s;u|peradded,
touching the Offices of Magi&s;tracy, the Te&s;t
Act has much better and effectually provided, which has
been already con&s;ider'd; and therefore as to what is di|&s;tinctly
under my pre&s;ent Head of Di&s;cour&s;e to be treated
of, there remains in Sub&s;tance of the Corporation Act yet
in Force no more than this, <HI>That no Man &s;hall be Pla|ced,
Elected or Cho&s;en in or to any Offices, or Places, or
Tru&s;ts, or other Imployment relating to, or concerning the
Government of the re&s;pective Boroughs,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>who has not
within One Year before &s;uch Election taken the Sacrament
according to the Rites of the Church of</HI> England; <HI>in De|fault
whereof every &s;uch Election is thereby declared to
be void.</HI> This being the full Import of the &s;aid Act at pre|&s;ent,
it is upon that Foot a Mea&s;ure mu&s;t be taken, what
and how much the intended Bill would have enacted
new upon this Head; it cannot be ami&s;s here to ob&s;erve,
that the Corporation Act was the fir&s;t after the Re&s;taura|tion,
which directly affected the Di&s;&s;enters as &s;uch.</P>
<P><HI>Now</HI> in Corporations there are many Offices of a pri|vate
and inferior Nature, (<HI>which cannot be fully &s;peci|fied,
becau&s;e they are &s;o various in the re&s;pective Boroughs</HI>)
whereon the Safety of the State does not appear manife&s;tly
to depend, but regard only the Affairs of the particular Town
within it &s;elf. Some of the&s;e are Freeholds, and many of
them the whole Sub&s;i&s;tence of Families, which have been
obtained by Purcha&s;e or long Services, or attained by Cu|&s;tom
of Cour&s;e. Several of the&s;e the Di&s;&s;enters are now
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, and perhaps have enjoyed many Years, under an
Obedience to all &s;uch Terms, as the Law now in being has
pre&s;cribed; and to di&s;poil Men of their Freeholds and
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions by a new Law, without Imputation of any
Crime; and when the Security of the Government does not
<PB N="19" REF="17">
appear manife&s;tly concern'd, is &s;ure among Engli&s;h Alen very
hard.</P>
<P>That the Di&s;&s;enters at this Day are not Di&s;affected to
the Queen and E&s;tabli&s;h'd Government, nor chargea|ble
with Rebellion pa&s;t, nor meditating new Troubles, or
any ways dangerous to the State, (under which Characters
the Corporation-Act con&s;ider'd them) the Preamble of this
very Bill now in Debate does intimate: For it a&s;&s;erts,
That <HI>the Act in the fir&s;t Year of the Reign of the late
King</HI> William <HI>and Queen</HI> Mary, <HI>of Ever-glorious Memory,
entituled, An Act for Exempting Their Maje&s;ties Prote&s;tant
Subjects, Di&s;&s;enting from the Church of</HI> England, <HI>from the
Penalties of certain Laws, was in due Con&s;ideration, that
Per&s;ecution for Con&s;cience only was contrary to the Profe&s;|&s;ion
of the Chri&s;tian Religion and Doctrine of the Church of</HI>
England.</P>
<P><HI>If then the Di&s;&s;enters under an Obedience to all &s;uch Terms
as the Law now in being has pre&s;cribed,</HI> do po&s;&s;e&s;s many
inferior Offices in Corporations, which the pre&s;ent Bill,
when pa&s;&s;ed into an Act, would immediately &s;eclude from;
be&s;ides tho&s;e in the Magi&s;tracy, the Navy, the Cu&s;toms,
the Exci&s;e, the Royal Hou&s;hold, and others, which under
the Head of the Te&s;t-Act it would al&s;o deprive them of, then
(&s;ure enough) it takes from the Di&s;&s;enters, what they en|joyed
before by Law, and is not this to enact &s;omething
new? <HI>Moreover, the Di&s;&s;enters at any time, upon the pre|&s;ent
Terms of Conforming, are now admittable to any Office
of what Quality &s;oever in the Kingdom; but by this Bill they
would have a total Incapacity put upon them, in re&s;pect to
tho&s;e under the Te&s;t and Corporation Acts above-mentioned.</HI>
Which Incapacity after the fir&s;t Offence would extend to
Offices of Inheritance, and in the Fore&s;ts, Non Commi&s;&s;ion
Offices in the Fleet, and many more, &s;uch as neither the
Te&s;t or Corporation-Acts, or any other, ever did, or in|tended
to exclude them from.</P>
<P>It has been already in&s;i&s;ted, That <HI>all the Offices wherein
the Safety of Church and State are manife&s;tly concern'd,
are comprehended within the Te&s;t,</HI> and that the inferior Of|fices
in the Boroughs do not come under the &s;ame Con&s;idera|tions;
<PB N="20" REF="18">
to have therefore the &s;ame Rea&s;ons of State urged
for an equal Animadver&s;ion upon the latter, &s;eems very
unequal; for it brings great Difficulty on the Commercial
Sort of Men, to argue on tho&s;e Topicks, while they plead
for no more than quiet Cohabi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ation with their Neighbours.
But if it be argued, that tho&s;e poor Emolumen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s in the
Boroughs, which the Safety of the Government might
(doubtle&s;s) well enough indulge them, came within the In|tent
at lea&s;t of the Corporation-Act to deny to the Di&s;&s;enters,
how &s;hould they judge of it but very &s;evere, to have that
Act &s;o explained and enforced to their Di&s;advantage, that
it &s;hould take Place more in the Reign of Her Gracious Ma|je&s;ty
than it has done in any time preceding?</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e the Di&s;&s;enters do humbly apologize for
them&s;elves (as it imports them) that granting whatever was
de&s;igned by this Bill, was the Intent then of the Corporati|on-Act,
they do not now &s;tand in the &s;ame Place the la&s;t
Age did at the pa&s;&s;ing thereof; the pre&s;ent Generation it
cannot be pretended have brought upon the Church and
State, Confu&s;ions, Ruin and De&s;olation; they have no Ways
di&s;turbed the Peace of either, but have <HI>by Te&s;timonies in|conte&s;tible
&s;hew'd, that neither their Principles or Practice
are incon&s;i&s;tent with Monarchy, but contrariwi&s;e mo&s;t conform|able
to the pre&s;ent Government and Settlement of the Crown,
nor are there any evil Spirits working of Rebellion among
them.</HI> If therefore the Intent of the Corporation-Act was
built upon Rea&s;ons peculiar to that time, they do en|tirely
&s;ubmit it to Con&s;ideration, whether a pur&s;uing of the
&s;ame Intent now, and giving (by the negative Qualification
and Penalties of this Bill) an Extent and Force to it, which
in the In&s;titution, or fince it never had before, without any
like Cau&s;e on their Part, would not be in the Nature of
puni&s;hing the Innocent for the &s;ake of the Guilty, which
they do not doubt will be far from &s;o Wi&s;e, Ju&s;t and Good
a Government; but the propo&s;ed Bill they conceive upon the
Head only of the Corporation-Act, would have brought
upon them the extraordinary Hard&s;hips and Difficulties
here following.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="19">
1<HI>&s;t,</HI> The Qualification for Offices being made to con&s;i&s;t
in the utmo&s;t Di&s;tance and Aver&s;ion unto them, will be a
Brand of Ignominy and Reproach upon the whole Body of
Di&s;&s;enters, &s;o that an Emulation in ca&s;ting Injuries and Con|tempt
upon them may in a little time be thought the be&s;t
Recommendation, and neare&s;t Way to Preferment; is it
ju&s;t therefore that the whole Body &s;hould &s;uffer for the
&s;ake comparatively of a very few, who have occa&s;ionally
Conformed?</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> Reviving the Acts again&s;t Seditious Conventicles
in part, and giving a new Force to that of the Corpora|tions,
they fear will give too much Occa&s;ion to Men of
violent Tempers, to declaim that they lye &s;till under the
&s;ame odious Imputations of Di&s;loyalty charged upon them
by tho&s;e Acts, as if they gave really any manner of Jea|lou&s;ie
to the State now; which Clamour (however cau&s;e|le&s;s)
when it &s;hall be indu&s;triou&s;ly vented, would be in it
&s;elf a very heavy Affliction.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly, The Freeholds and Offices of an inferiour Nature,</HI>
in 600 Towns of <HI>England,</HI> or thereabouts, <HI>which have been
obtained by Purcha&s;e or long Services, or in Cour&s;e, &s;ome
of them the whole Sub&s;i&s;tence of Families, and of long time
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, under an Obedience to all the Terms pre&s;cribed
by Law,</HI> would not only be immediately lo&s;t to the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors,
but an Incapacity would lye upon all Di&s;&s;enters for
the future of attaining the like, and (after the fir&s;t Offence)
any other Offices in the Kingdom what&s;oever; but they
hope <HI>the Crime charged upon &s;ome few of them, is not of
&s;o dete&s;table a Nature, that they ought all to be reduced to &s;o
unhappy a Condition for it.</HI></P>
<P>4<HI>thly, In many Corporations the Election of Members to
&s;erve in Parliament, is only in &s;uch as are concern'd in
the Government of them, and giving a Vote for a Repre&s;enta|tive
in Parliament, is the e&s;&s;ential Privilege whereby every En|gli&s;hman
pre&s;erves his Property, and what&s;oever deprives
him of a Capacity for having &s;uch Vote, deprives him of
his Birthright.</HI> The Magi&s;tracy of Corporations, which by
the Te&s;t-Act now takes Place is one thing, but the Offices
affected by the new Bill would be quite another.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="20">
5<HI>thly,</HI> There have been for &s;everal Towns and Cities
Acts pa&s;&s;ed of late Years, for &s;etting the Poor on Work
therein, and puni&s;hing Vagrants, be&s;ides the former ancient
Ho&s;pitals; touching which the Di&s;&s;enters are likely by this
Bill to have been excluded the appearing u&s;efully in their
Places, which is a Mark of Di&s;honour on them, as well as
Di&s;couragement to charitable Intentions.</P>
<P>6thly, To leave Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters &s;ubject to Fines and
Penalties, if they do not accept Offices (<HI>toties quoties</HI>) and
at the &s;ame time if they do accept, to re&s;train them upon
the &s;evere Penalties of this Bill from doing what their Con|&s;cience
obliges to, whether this would not (<HI>again&s;t the In|tent

Men might be left to judge, but they only would feel,
and every Borough in</HI> England <HI>at Di&s;cretion be left to pro|portion
the Degree.</HI></P>
<P>7<HI>thly,</HI> The Di&s;&s;enters have Rea&s;on to fear innumerable In|juries
and Oppre&s;&s;ions (be&s;ides the&s;e mention'd) would be
their Lot, in all municipal Rates, Freedoms, Duties, Pri|vileges,
Services, Pari&s;h-Offices, and every &s;ort of Inter|cour&s;e
with their Town&s;men and Neighbours. When upon
Complaint of any &s;uch Injuries tho&s;e Fellow-Citizens, who
only have Power to do them Ju&s;tice, are like to &s;uffer in
their own Reputations, Intere&s;ts and Employments for &s;o do|ing,
as Favourers of the phanatical, excluded, Party.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations of their &s;uffering, though they ap|pear
evident and unavoidable, are with all Candor and Re|&s;ignation
referr'd to the Judgment of others; but the Di&s;|&s;enters
mu&s;t crave Leave to add, that they would be the
more pungent and &s;en&s;ible upon Per&s;ons not chargeable by
the Bill with any Offence, becau&s;e without Penal Laws and
their Attendants, with the clamorous In&s;ults of the Pro|phane
and de&s;igning, the very di&s;&s;enting from the Pub|lick,
is in it &s;elf (as to earthly Things) many ways a Mi&s;|fortune,
which nothing but unpretended Con&s;cience (how|ever
mi&s;taken) would oblige them to.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Penalties, which are the la&s;t Part of the
Bill, &s;hall be con&s;ider'd under Three Heads. 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> What
<PB N="23" REF="21">
Sutablene&s;s there is in them to the Act of Indulgence.
2<HI>dly,</HI> What Proportion between the Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters
and Popi&s;h. 3<HI>dly,</HI> What Danger from thence to the Inno|cent.</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t,</HI>
For the Sutablene&s;s there is in the&s;e Penalties to
the Act of Indulgence; it may &s;ure be granted, that <HI>the
good Effects of Liberty to tender Con&s;ciences are every|where
vi&s;ible, that the foregoing Bitterne&s;s and Animo&s;ities
are much calmed, the Di&s;&s;enters brought to a Temper of Re|&s;pect,
and more Candor towards the Church, and the Church
&s;atisfied by &s;ufficient Experience, that the Freedom of others
does not le&s;&s;en Her Security and Reputation. Thus is our</HI>
Sion <HI>at Unity within Her &s;elf, and the Unity of the Spi|rit
in the Bond of Peace (according to the Prayer of our
Church) pre&s;erv'd.</HI> One cannot therefore lay to Heart the
Peace of our <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> without &s;ome Concern, le&s;t the
Severities of this Bill &s;hould contribute to di&s;turb it;
for be&s;ides that it would di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s immediately Per&s;ons
legally ve&s;ted with Places, and affect many Offices which
no Law did before, and many ways be injurious in the
Boroughs, and leave Men to occa&s;ional Per&s;ecution for
Con&s;cience &s;ake, and be a Brand upon all the A&s;&s;emblies
of Di&s;&s;enters, as already has been in&s;tanced, there are in it
&s;ome further Peculiarities of Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>Before the Act of Indulgence, while Conventicles were Il|legal
and Criminal A&s;&s;emblies, even then a Man in Office,
who was pre&s;ent at them, was only liable to a
Fine of Ten Pounds, whereas by this Bill he is liable to
a Fine of 100 l. and 5 l.</HI> per Diem <HI>for Three Months, be|&s;ides
Lo&s;s of his Place.</HI> The Sum you &s;ee may amount
to 550 l. which is more than would need to beggar &s;ome
Thou&s;ands of Corporation; and other Officers in <HI>England,</HI>
whould be liable to it, and the more in Danger, becau&s;e
the whole Sum goes to the Informer, which is good Booty
for that &s;ort of Privateers; and the rather, when a Con|viction
on this Bill, would not be &s;o difficult, as in mo&s;t
other Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters during the wor&s;t of their Pro&s;ecutions here|tofore,
upon a vi&s;ible Conformity, without Renunciation or
<PB N="24" REF="22">
declared Abhorrence of their former Practice, were at any
time capable of Places of Profit and Tru&s;t, but this Bill
draws over all their Heads a di&s;mal Cloud of Incapacity.
<HI>None will deny but a total Incapacity to &s;erve his Prince and
Country is a Mark of high Infamy, &s;o that next to the Lo&s;s of
Life it &s;eems the heavie&s;t Puni&s;hment, and in the &s;everal
Towns Corporate of</HI> England (which may probably be 6 or
700) <HI>to be rendred by Law incapable, of ever acquiring
the Support of any of tho&s;e little Places which appertain
to them, be&s;ides tho&s;e of Profit under the Head of the Te&s;t-Act,
and tho&s;e many more (upon Conviction) which no Law
yet has ever affected, is altogether</HI> (if con&s;ider'd) <HI>a very
unhapyy Condition; but after the immediate Forfeiture of
all the &s;everal Offices, now legally po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Di&s;&s;en|ters,
upon the Pa&s;&s;ing of this Bill, then a Per&s;on might
&s;till go to a Meeting, without Breach of any Law (as long
as the Toleration continues</HI>) and one would think &s;uch a
Man were <HI>bonus &amp; legalis homo,</HI> and capable of the Pri|vileges
of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ree-born Subject, and at Liberty to provide
for his Family and Maintainance, but to impo&s;e a &s;evere
Cen&s;ure on any Action allowed by Law, &s;eems very un|rea&s;onable;
however that be, there would remain upon
all and every Man of the Di&s;&s;enters, an Incapacity not
only as above, but (after the fir&s;t Offence) for any Office
or Imployment what&s;oever within the Kingdom, in which
Regard this Bill would extend to Offices of Inheritance,
and in the Fore&s;ts, Non-Commi&s;&s;ion Offices in the Fleet,
with many more, which neither the Te&s;t or Corporation-Acts,
or any other, ever could affect, or ever intended &s;o
to do.</P>
<P>As to the Shame and Incapacity of one Convicted upon
this Bill; that is to &s;ay, <HI>before he ever again could enter
by Grant or Election, into any Office or Imployment within
the Kingdom of</HI> England, <HI>he mu&s;t at the next Quarter-Se&s;&s;i|ons
of the County where he re&s;ides, or in one of Her Ma|je&s;ties
Courts at</HI> We&s;tmin&s;ter, <HI>in publick and open Court
make Oath in writing, that within the Year foregoing he
has not once been pre&s;ent at any Conventicle, but has Three
times at the lea&s;t receiv'd the Sacrament at the Church;
<PB N="25" REF="23">
which Oath is to be kept upon Record.</HI> This would not be &s;o
much worthy of Con&s;ideration, nor the Aggravation of the
Sentence on a &s;econd Offence (as a Relap&s;e and Apo&s;tacy)
if the value of the Forfeiture, and Ea&s;ine&s;s of Conviction,
did not put too much Hazard on the Innocent, even af|ter
&s;uch Purgation, as well as before it.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> The Proportion by the Penalties of this Bill, be|tween
the Prote&s;tant and Papi&s;t, is to be &s;canned by Two
Ways: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By examining whether they are equally lia|ble
to Lo&s;s of Offices, and &s;uffering the Puni&s;hments.
<HI>2dly,</HI> What Difference there is otherwi&s;e. For the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI>
the Te&s;t being more expre&s;ly contrived, to eject all Popi&s;h
Recu&s;ants, and the Complexion of the Times &s;ince the
Grand Revolution, not favouring them, every Man will
agree with me, that the immediate Lo&s;s to them upon
pa&s;&s;ing this Bill would be nothing, they have no Con|cern
in the Matter; but on the other Hand the Di&s;&s;en|ters
(<HI>under the Terms hitherto required by Law</HI>) do po&s;|&s;e&s;s
many Offices, as has been di&s;tinctly intimated, the fir&s;t
Lo&s;s to them thereupon would upon many Accounts be very
con&s;iderable. Now for the Puni&s;hments &s;ufferable by this Bill,
the Di&s;&s;enters enjoying a Liberty upon Condition of open
Doors, a Conviction would at all times be more fea&s;able
upon them, than the Papi&s;ts, who are enforced to conceal
their Wor&s;hip by other Laws. Furthermore, the Nature
of the Prote&s;tant Wor&s;hip requires all their Attendants at
once, whereas that of private Ma&s;&s;es need not engage above
Five, be&s;ides the Family in the &s;ame In&s;tant. Thus the
Papi&s;t would not be &s;o expo&s;ed to the Forfeitures, Fine and
Incapacity, as the Prote&s;tant.</P>
<P>The Difference otherwi&s;e between the Popi&s;h and Pro|te&s;tant
Di&s;&s;enter is no more than this; that whereas the
Te&s;t-Act did more expre&s;ly intend the Papi&s;t, and the Pro|te&s;tant
was but tacitly included, the Bill under Con&s;ide|ration
u&s;es &s;uch Terms only as have been appropriate to Prote|&s;tants,
and herein the Papi&s;t is but tacitly included, however
he is equally reach'd by the Intention and Penalties hereof;
and thus the Popi&s;h Di&s;&s;enter and Prote&s;tant do &s;tand upon a
Par; but granting the Papi&s;t is not liable to Lo&s;s of Be|nefit
<PB N="26" REF="24">
at all, or to &s;uffering the Penalties like the Prote|&s;tant,
becau&s;e Conviction is more difficult upon him, <HI>no
Man is made liable to &s;uffer &s;o much by any other Law,
for a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the &s;olemne&s;t Acts of that Religion, as he
would by this Bill, for being pre&s;ent at a Conventicle. A
Popi&s;h Convict, receiving the Sacrament of the Church
is immediately clear'd; no &s;uch Shame of Renuntiation;
no Incapacity lyes upon him. A Papi&s;t that &s;hall relap&s;e,
and fall under a &s;econd Conviction, is to be convicted over
again, without any Aggravation of his Cen&s;ure. But Ju|&s;tice
and good Policy require there &s;hould be a Proportion
between the Offence and Puni&s;hment. Thus the Laws of</HI>
England <HI>have all along treated Papi&s;ts as the mo&s;t inve|terate,
re&s;tle&s;s and formidable Enemies of the State, be|cau&s;e
they depend upon a Foreign Power, and are &s;ub|ject
to it, which is &s;uch a one as always was, and ever will
be imployed to ruin us, there&s;ore there has con&s;tantly been
a le&s;s degree of Puni&s;hment in the Laws upon the Prote|&s;tant
Di&s;&s;enter than them.</HI> This Rea&s;on, if I be not mi&s;ta|ken,
has a con&s;iderable Acce&s;&s;ion of Weight to it in our
Days, the Papi&s;ts having refu&s;ed, &s;ince the late Revolu|tion,
their Allegiance to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> more than
ever from the early Days of the Reformation.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Let us con&s;ider what Danger would ari&s;e from
the Penalties of this Bill to the Innocent, for their Safe|ty
&s;eems the highe&s;t Concern of all Laws. <HI>Now for the
Admini&s;trations in publick, according to the Liturgy of the
Church, though for want of it before Univer&s;ity-Sermons,
or upon an Omi&s;&s;ion of Prayer for the Royal Family, or
upon contravening the Practice of the Church of</HI> England,
<HI>Men would come within the Letter of this Bill, which
is a Condition not wholly out of Danger,</HI> yet 'tis likely the
obvious De&s;ign of it being again&s;t Di&s;&s;enters, would ren|der
a Pro&s;ecution in tho&s;e Ca&s;es fruitle&s;s; <HI>however, Fami|ly
Prayers differing from the Liturgy, at which &s;hould be
pre&s;ent more than Five accidentally above the Hou&s;hold,</HI>
(Circum&s;tances not uncommon) <HI>would clearly come within
Reach, and then the Villany of a couple of bad Servants</HI>
(di&s;mi&s;t perhaps for ill Practices) <HI>would have &s;ufficient En|couragement:</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="25">
But the greate&s;t Danger to the Innocent a|ri&s;es
from Two Things in this Bill. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> From the Va|lue
of the Forfeiture, which may amount to 500 <HI>l.</HI> and
is all given to the Informers, <HI>a Temptation beyond what is
commonly &s;et before them by our Laws, or what the Inte|grity
of the Age can well a&s;&s;ure us again&s;t; for a dete|&s;table
&s;ort of Men there has been, who for much le&s;s Gains
have done wrongfully to a great many, and proved a very
Nu&s;ance to the Government, &s;everal of whom were Con|victed
of Perjury about 20 Years ago. 2dly,</HI> The Ea&s;ine&s;s
of Conviction is another Subject of Danger to the Innocent, for
<HI>as the Law in relation to Offices now &s;tands, every Man
chu&s;es his own Witne&s;&s;es to receiving of the Sacrament;
who&s;e Atte&s;tation, with that of the Mini&s;ters and Church|wardens,
being put upon Record, a Man is almo&s;t beyond
a Po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uffering by a fal&s;e Accu&s;ation.</HI> But in the
Bill before us 'tis not &s;o &s;afe, for <HI>fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es may chu&s;e
to a&s;&s;ign &s;uch a Time and Place</HI> (when they &s;aw him at a
Meeting) <HI>as they know the Party lea&s;t likely to di&s;prove,
and the Accu&s;ed in that Ca&s;e has but a kind of Negative
Proof, to defend him&s;elf withal.</HI></P>
<P>As I have not pre&s;umed to draw into Argument the
Di&s;po&s;al of Offices, wherein the Safety of Church and
State did appear manife&s;tly concern'd, &s;o neither &s;hall I
once enter into the Thoughts of tho&s;e high Affairs,
which might be any ways affected by this Bill; as whe|ther
the de&s;irable Union with <HI>Scotland</HI> may not be em|bara&s;&s;ed
thereby; whether putting all Foreign Churches
under a Cen&s;ure may weaken the good Under&s;tanding,
which ought to be between <HI>England</HI> and her Prote&s;tant
Allies; whether this Expedient bears due Regard to the
Condition of like Affairs among our neare&s;t Neighbours,
<HI>Holland, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> or whether in time of &s;o
dubious a War, e&s;pecially &s;ince a Pretender to our Throne
is &s;et up by the Enemy, it be proper to do any thing,
which may rai&s;e Heats and Animo&s;ities among our &s;elves;
the&s;e being Matters cognizable only, by the proper Mini|&s;ters
of State, or the High Court of Parliament, and not fit
for private Per&s;ons to debate.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="26">
As to the grand Point of their Loyalty and due Alle|giance,
which above all others the Di&s;&s;enters are concern'd
to vindicate them&s;elves about; Her Maje&s;ties Loving Sub|jects,
who (being Prote&s;tants, and by the Rights of Nature
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men) lye under the Unhappine&s;s of di&s;&s;enting in
&s;ome &s;maller Matters of Religion, from the E&s;tabli&s;h'd
Church, are abundantly &s;atisfied from the Chri&s;tian-like
Preamble of this Bill, and otherwi&s;e, that in the Sacred
Brea&s;t of Her mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ty, and in tho&s;e al&s;o of
the Highly Honoured Lords and Commons of <HI>England,</HI> they
&s;tand fully acquitted from the vile and dete&s;table Im|putation
of any Principles repugnant to the Safety of this
Government; the Te&s;timony of their own Con&s;ciences
does equally concur, and their Behaviour &s;hall (as they
hope it does) demon&s;trate to all the World, that none of
their Fellow-Subjects can be more devoted to the pre&s;ent
Rightful and Lawful Settlement of the Crown; were
&s;uch Imputations true, they could never with any Face
complain of whatever Hard&s;hips were put upon them;
but being in the Ca&s;e of the pre&s;ent Government ab&s;ol|ved
before God and Men, they do always allow them&s;elves
to hope, that during their con&s;onant and uniform Obe|dience,
no Difficulties or Di&s;tre&s;&s;es will be laid upon them;
and above all, nothing which may look like a Blemi&s;h
upon their Loyalty; Her mo&s;t Gracious Maje&s;ty (whom
God long pre&s;erve) has &s;everal times expre&s;t her Pious
Parental Candor and Compa&s;&s;ion unto them, who in|deed,
without the Severity of Penal Laws, are for the
&s;ake of undi&s;&s;embled Con&s;cience daily under various Tem|poral
Misfortunes, and as from that Di&s;po&s;ition of Her
Maje&s;ties, they hold the Benefits of the Act of Indulgence,
(dear to them above all other earthly Con&s;iderations)
none can more ardently and &s;incerely than they, con&s;tant|ly
do, and will implore the choice&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven,
upon Her Excellent Maje&s;ty, and all their Governors.</P>
<P>To di&s;&s;ent from the Publick, they are &s;en&s;ible is al|ways
to be in the Wrong; but if in&s;tead of the few
Things &s;crupled, wherein they are involuntarily &s;o, their
Union in the E&s;&s;ential, and more important Points of Reli|gion
<PB N="29" REF="27">
with the Church, might find a due Con&s;ideration,
they doubt not but all Reproaches upon them, of any
ho&s;tile Di&s;po&s;itions towards it, would al&s;o be done away.
This is what, next to an affectionate Allegiance to the
State they could de&s;ire mo&s;t, to vindicate to them&s;elves
the Character of, and which they have for many Years,
by all Means &s;o endeavour'd, that if the unfriendly Pa&s;|&s;ions
of &s;ome Men, with the vi&s;ible Intere&s;t of the Papi&s;ts,
had not hindred, the &s;ame would long e'er this have crown|ed
their Wi&s;hes with an univer&s;al Atte&s;tation: To di&s;&s;ent
touching Matters civil and common, from any Society
we are in, I appeal to all Men, does it imply Ill-will to
it? Why then &s;hould it be con&s;trued &s;o in the Ca&s;e before
us? Or if we plea&s;e, why not quite otherwi&s;e?</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England</HI> is it not as a City, which
has an ambitious and powerful Enemy in the Field? She
has indeed other Fortifications more near and proper, but
why may not the Di&s;&s;enters to her al&s;o be accounted, as
detached Outworks and Lines of Defence? Had ever the
common Enemy a De&s;ign immediate to execute upon this
City, but fir&s;t his &s;ecret Engines were wrought to breed
Mi&s;under&s;tanding between the Town and her Dependants,
then open Attacks were made upon the &s;eparated Forts;
and while many Storms have fallen upon tho&s;e, their Fi|delity
to the Town has been the more approv'd, but the
City it &s;elf &s;ecure? No Per&s;ecutions could extort any Pe|tition
from them for a Toleration of Popery. But after a
long and ob&s;tinate Defence, when tho&s;e outward Po&s;ts
came to be abandon'd and demoli&s;h'd, did not the Ene|my
&s;oon get within the Town? The Papi&s;ts ('tis true)
when once po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of their Conque&s;t, to &s;ecure again&s;t
the Revolt of it, though before by open Force they had
taken and levell'd all tho&s;e Redoubts, did then officiou&s;ly
erect them anew, thinking to &s;erve their Intere&s;t of them:
But the Di&s;&s;enters, glad of Liberty indeed (who can blame
them?) no &s;ooner di&s;cover'd the Enemy's De&s;ign, then
they adhered to their ancient Mother and Principal.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="28">
The Author hereof, to obviate undue Con&s;tructions&punc;
thinks fit to declare he is not liable to the Lo&s;s of any
Office by the fore&s;aid Bill, nor has he reaped any per|&s;onal
Advantage from the Revolution, or any ways from
the Government &s;ince; but the true Occa&s;ion of this Di&s;|cour&s;e
was not &s;o much a Re&s;pect to the Di&s;&s;enters, as
an accidental Computation in him&s;elf, of the flouri&s;hing
E&s;tate of the Reformed Intere&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> in the Com|mencement
of the la&s;t Century, and of the di&s;mal De|clen&s;ion
of it at the latter end, which gave him Occa&s;ion
to reflect, that in Humane Appearance, the only defen&s;i|ble
Bulwark of it now mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t, in the Welfare of
our Government, and an indi&s;&s;oluble Union with <HI>Holland.</HI>
Upon which Occa&s;ion, con&s;idering that <HI>the Indemnity of
Di&s;&s;enters from Penal Laws, was by the Act of Indulgence
declared an effectual Means to unite our Prote&s;tant Fel|low-Subjects
in Intere&s;t and Affection,</HI> He could not but
conclude, that the impo&s;ing new Penalties and Sufferings
would di&s;unite them; and what can look more fatal
upon us than to &s;ee buried Animo&s;ities flame out afre&s;h?
Who can tell but a Breach, when open'd, may, beyond
all our Fore&s;ight, grow in time &s;o wide, that the mer|cile&s;s
U&s;urpations of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> may enter at it?</P>
<P><HI>But as to our Days, the Hope and Wi&s;hes of our
Enemies &s;hall be di&s;appointed, if we will li&s;ten to the
Direction, which the pious and prudent Authority over

Fa&s;t</HI> (to obtain Succe&s;s in this War, whereon the Safe|ty

lay to Heart the great Dangers we are in, by our un|happy
Divi&s;ions; take away all Hatred and Prejudice, and
what&s;oever el&s;e may hinder us from Godly Union and
Concord. That as there is but one Body and one Spirit
and one Hope of our Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one

Bapti&s;m, one God and Father of us all, &s;o we may hence|forth
be all of one Heart, and of one Soul, united in one
Holy Bond of Truth and Peace, of Faith and Charity;
