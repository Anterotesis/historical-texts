<L>Clo&s;e up that very Moment&mdash;to prevent</L>
<L>The cour&s;e of JUSTICE, from her fair intent,</L>
<L>In vain my neare&s;t, deare&s;t friend &s;hall plead,</L>
<L>In vain my mother kneel&mdash;my &s;oul may bleed,</L>
<L>But mu&s;t not change&mdash;When JUSTICE draws the dart,</L>
<L>Tho' it is doom'd to, pierce a Fav'rite's Heart,</L>
<L>'Tis mine to give it force, to give it aim&mdash;</L>
<L>I know it Duty, and I feel it Fame.</L>
