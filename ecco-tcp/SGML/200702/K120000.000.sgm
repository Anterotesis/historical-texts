<HEAD>THE OLD WHIG. <HI>With</HI> REMARKS <HI>upon the</HI> PLEBEIAN, N^o II.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the <HI>Plebeian,</HI> to &s;hew him&s;elf a per|fect Ma&s;ter <HI>in the Vocation of Pamphlet Writing,</HI> begins like a Son of <HI>Grub&s;treet,</HI> with declaring the great E&s;teem he has for him&s;elf, and the Contempt he entertains for the Scribblers of the Age. One wou'd think, by his way of repre&s;enting it, that the unexpected Appear|ance of his Pamphlet was as great a Surprize upon the World as that of the late Meteor, or indeed &s;omething more terrible, if you will believe the Author's magnificent De&s;cription of his own Performance. <HI>The</HI> Plebeian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Page <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;tarting forth unexpectedly, they were forced like Peo|ple in a Surprize, or on an Inva&s;ion, to March immediate|ly any Troops they had.</HI> If Cardinal <HI>Alberoni</HI>'s Attempt, which furni&s;hes the Allu&s;ion, &s;ucceeds no better than that of his Friend the Pamphleteer, he won't have much to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>Our Author, in his triumphant Progre&s;s, fir&s;t animad|verts on a Writer, whom he &s;ays he never read, which being my own Ca&s;e, I &s;hall leave that Writer to defend him&s;elf. The &s;econd he mentions, con&s;idering the Strength of his Arguments, and the Clo&s;ene&s;s of his Rea&s;oning, de|&s;erved a little more regard from the <HI>Plebeian,</HI> who, it &s;eems, <HI>with much ado went thro' the Performance.</HI> This
<PB N="2" REF="3">
wou'd certainly have been true, had he gone through it with a de&s;ign to An&s;wer it.</P>
<P><HI>Having routed</HI> Baronius, <HI>and confounded</HI> Bellarmine, <HI>pa&s;s we on to the next,</HI> &s;aid the Country Curate to his admiring Audience. Our Author pur&s;ues his Conque&s;ts with the &s;ame Satisfaction and Intrepidity. In the fir&s;t place he is angry with a Writer for a&s;&s;uming the Name of the <HI>Old Whig,</HI> who may more ju&s;tly recriminate upon this Author for taking that of the <HI>Plebeian,</HI> a Title which he is by no means fond of retaining, if we may give Credit to many &s;hrewd Gue&s;&s;ers. But he tells the Old Whig, that he <HI>ex|pected</HI> from that Title <HI>no le&s;s than the utmo&s;t Wrath and In|dignation again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Lords.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>6</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> How does this agree with the Cen&s;ure he pa&s;&s;es upon him afterwards, for <HI>treat|ing that Species in &s;uch a manner as he dares not venture to repeat!</HI> I mu&s;t however remind this Author of the <HI>Milk</HI> with which he <HI>nur&s;es our Nobles,</HI> not to omit his <HI>&s;tagnated Pool</HI>; Pa&s;&s;ages of &s;uch a Nature, that in Imitation of the Author, I &s;hall di&s;patch them with an <HI>Horre&s;co refe|rens!</HI></P>
<P>The Author, in the next Paragraph, gives us a Definition of the Point in Debate, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>it is a Jumble and a Hodge-Podge.</HI> A mo&s;t clear, comprehen&s;ive, and elegant Account of the Matter!</P>
<P>The Author then continues his Animo&s;ities again&s;t the Ephori of <HI>Lacedaemon</HI>; but this Pa&s;&s;age I &s;hall wave for two Rea&s;ons, Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e it is nothing to the Purpo&s;e. Secondly, Becau&s;e I am informed there are two or three keen Di&s;putants, who will return a proper An&s;wer to it, when they have di&s;cover'd the Author.</P>
<P>The <HI>Plebeian</HI> proceeds to detect an imaginary Mi&s;take in the Old Whig, for having a&s;&s;erted that <HI>there has been as great an Alteration in one Branch of the Legi&s;lature, as is
<PB N="3" REF="4">
now propo&s;ed to be made in another.</HI> A Fact immediately puts an end to a Di&s;pute, and, in the Ca&s;e before us, &s;tands thus,
<LIST>
<ITEM><LABEL>King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. added to the Hou&s;e of Commons</LABEL> 38 Members.</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>King <HI>Edward</HI> VI.</LABEL> 44</ITEM>

<ITEM><LABEL>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI></LABEL> 62</ITEM>
<ITEM><LABEL>King <HI>James</HI> I.</LABEL> 27</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Que&s;tion now is, whether the Re&s;training the Num|ber of the Hou&s;e of Commons to what it is at pre&s;ent, was not as great an Alteration in that Branch of the Legi&s;lature, as the Re&s;triction now propo&s;ed wou'd be to the other Branch of the Legi&s;lature, &s;hou'd it take place in it. To which I &s;hall add the following Que&s;tion, Whether the In|conveniencies ari&s;ing from that continual Increa&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Commons, did not make the Re&s;traint upon it prudent and nece&s;&s;ary; and Whether if the like Inconve|niencies ari&s;e from this perpetually increa&s;ing Hou&s;e of Lords, it is not as nece&s;&s;ary and as prudent to put a &s;top to it? As for the little Towns of <HI>Watchet</HI> and <HI>Dun&s;ter,</HI> our Au|thor can draw nothing from them to the Advantage of his Cau&s;e, if he can be&s;tow Labour and Time enough, of which he finds it nece&s;&s;ary to be very &s;paring in this Argument, to peru&s;e the printed Li&s;t of Counties and Boroughs, to whom the Privilege of &s;ending Repre&s;entatives to Parliament was granted or re&s;tored by the &s;everal Princes above-mention|ed; and to An&s;wer the &s;hort Query propo&s;ed to him at the end of it, with relation to Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>After having propo&s;ed the&s;e Que&s;tions in plain Terms, I come in the next Place to one of the Plebeian's, which is carried on in Metaphor, till it ends in &s;ome|thing that is pa&s;t my Under&s;tanding. <HI>But the&s;e Retrench|ments being now made. The Que&s;tion,</HI> &s;ays he,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 6.</NOTE> <HI>at pre&s;ent is, whether the Commons ought to go on &s;tripping the Crown
<PB N="4" REF="5">
of every Jewel till it becomes le&s;s re&s;plendent than the Doge of</HI> Venice<HI>'s Coronet, or le&s;s comfortable than the Sword-bearer's Cap of Maintenance?</HI> I &s;hall only confront this metaphorical Query with one that is adapted to Men of or|dinary Capacities. <Q>The&s;e Retrenchments being made, whether the Commons ought to accept the Offer of the Crown, to part with a Prerogative that is &s;till exorbitant and dangerous to the Community?</Q></P>
<P>But our Author's chief Concern is for the poor Hou&s;e of Commons, whom he repre&s;ents as naked and defence|le&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 6.</NOTE> when the Crown, by lo&s;ing this Prerogative, wou'd be <HI>le&s;s able to protect them again&s;t the Power of a Hou&s;e of Lords.</HI> Who forbears laughing, when the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Friar repre&s;ents little <HI>Dickey,</HI> under the Per&s;on of <HI>Gomez,</HI> in|&s;ulting the Colonel that was able to fright him out of his Wits with a &s;ingle Frown? <HI>This Gomez,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>flew up|on him like a Dragon, got him down, the Devil being &s;trong in him, and gave him Ba&s;tinado on Ba&s;tinado, and Buffet upon Buffet, which the poor meek Colonel being pro&s;trate, &s;uffer'd with a mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Patience.</HI> The Improbability of the Fact never fails to rai&s;e Mirth in the Audience; and one may venture to an&s;wer for a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hou&s;e of Com|mons, if we may gue&s;s from it's Conduct hitherto, that it will &s;carce be either &s;o tame or &s;o weak, as our Author &s;uppo&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Plebeian,</HI> to turn off the Force of the Remark upon a|nother Paragraph, has Recour&s;e to a Shift that is of great U&s;e to controver&s;ial Writers, by affirming that his Antagoni&s;t mi&s;takes his Meaning. Let the impartial Reader judge whether an An&s;wer that proves this Alteration <HI>wou'd not be detrimental to the Hou&s;e of Peers,</HI> is not &s;uited to an Objection which &s;ays in &s;o many Words,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 7.</NOTE> that <HI>it wou'd be detrimental to the Hou&s;e of Peers it &s;elf.</HI> But &s;ays the <HI>Plebeian</HI> in this his Reply to the <HI>Old Whig, It will not be detrimental to them in point of Power, but it will be
<PB N="5" REF="6">
detrimental on Account of tho&s;e Talents which ought to ac|company Power, the Want of which the Commons will feel in their Judicature.</HI> Which is, in other Words, <Q>I do not mean when I &s;ay that it <HI>will be detrimental to the Hou&s;e of Peers it &s;elf,</HI> that it will be detrimental to the Peers, but that it will be detrimental to the Commons.</Q> I appeal to any Man, whether the <HI>Old Whig ignorantly mi&s;took</HI> the natural Sen&s;e of tho&s;e Words; or whether the <HI>Plebeian</HI> ignorantly expre&s;t, that which he now &s;ays was his Meaning in tho&s;e Words. The <HI>Plebeian</HI> having in his former Paper repre&s;ented, that this old &s;tanding Body of Peers without receiving numerous Additions from Time to Time, wou'd <HI>become corrupt and offen&s;ive like a &s;tagna|ted Pool,</HI> tells us here in excu&s;e for 'em,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 7</NOTE> that <HI>they will be offen&s;ive to others but not perceive it them&s;elves</HI>&punc; If I cou'd &s;uppo&s;e, with the Author, that they wou'd ever be in this Lamentable Pickle, I &s;hou'd be of his Opinion that they ought to be <HI>&s;weetned by &s;uch whol&s;ome, pure and fre&s;h Streams as are continually pa&s;&s;ing into them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Plebeian</HI> next Objects to the <HI>Old Whig</HI>'s Calcula|tion of the probable Extinction of two Titles, taking one Year with another. <HI>By the Calculation generally received,</HI> &s;ays this Author, <HI>I &s;uppo&s;e he means the Li&s;t publi&s;hed by way of Prelude to this Project.</HI> Whereas the <HI>Old Whig</HI> cou'd not take that Li&s;t for his Calculation, but formed his Cal|culation from that Li&s;t, and from the Nature of the Al|teration which is propo&s;ed. This Objection will imme|diately vani&s;h upon di&s;covering the Fallacy of the <HI>Plebeian</HI>'s Argument. He &s;uppo&s;es no greater Number of Extinctions wou'd happen among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lords, were their Num|bers &s;ettled at 184, than happen'd in that Body when they were only 59.104.142.153, 162. or 168. At this rate of calculating, the <HI>Plebeian</HI> will be &s;ure of gaining his Point, and affirms very truly that the Extinctions by a ju&s;t Medi|um amount to no more than a Peer and a half for every
<PB N="6" REF="7">
Year. But I appeal to hone&s;t Mr. <HI>Wingate,</HI> who was ne|ver looked upon as a Party-Writer, whether my Calcula|tion will not appear very ju&s;t, if examined by his Golden Rule, and other curious Operations of Arithmetick, which are to be met with in his Works. E&s;pecially when the Bill, as it evidently tends to multiply Extinctions, by preventing the Peerage from running into Collateral Lines, or de&s;cending to Females, will more than an&s;wer my Com|putation, if I &s;hould have the Misfortune to di&s;agree with the <HI>Plebeian</HI> about &s;ome very minute Fraction of a Lord, that might happen in the Space of 116 Years. As for tho&s;e contingent Vacancies which may be made by the Edge of the Law, our Author regards the Uncertainty of them as a very uncomfortable Pro&s;pect to the Candidates for Pa|trician Honours, &s;ince they may have <HI>time enough to try all their Patience,</HI> if they live in Hopes of &s;uch a Expe|dient for their Promotion. The a&s;certaining of this Point is indeed what I am not equal to, and mu&s;t therefore leave it to the Ma&s;ters of Political Calculation. But our Author is afraid, that if &s;uch lucky Opportunities of Extin|ction &s;hou'd happen, Lords may &s;till &s;it with their Heads on, unle&s;s a &s;ea&s;onable Increa&s;e may be made to 'em in &s;uch critical Junctures. This, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, is to me one very great Rea&s;on for the Alteration propo&s;ed; being fully of Opinion with the <HI>Old Whig,</HI> as expre&s;t in the following Words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whig. <HI>19.</HI></NOTE> <Q>Is this Inconvenience better pre|vented in a Hou&s;e of Peers on the Bottom it now &s;tands? Can any who has been a good Mini&s;ter be &s;e|cure, if the Crown &s;hou'd add a &s;ufficient Number of his Enemies to tho&s;e who &s;it in Judgment upon him? Or is a bad Mini&s;ter in any Danger, when he may be &s;helter'd by the Addition of a &s;ufficient Number of his Friends?</Q> The <HI>Plebeian</HI>'s An&s;wer to this Pa&s;&s;age is high|ly &s;atisfactory:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 9.</NOTE> <HI>In either of the&s;e Ca&s;es,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the ut|mo&s;t Iniquity mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd in the Crown, which I mu&s;t confe&s;s I cannot bring my &s;elf to do, and therefore my Argu|ment remains entire.</HI> I very much approve of the Author's
<PB N="7" REF="8">
dutiful and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Behaviour to the Crown, which puts one in mind of the worthy Alderman, who, upon hearing a Member of the Common-Council call the Emperor <HI>Nero a Mon&s;ter of Cruelty,</HI> told him, <HI>he ought not to &s;peak di&s;re|&s;pectfully of a Crowned Head.</HI> But if the Author will only go &s;uch Lengths with me, as to allow there ever has been a bad Soveraign, or not to &s;hock him with &s;uch a Suppo&s;iti|on, that there has ever been a wicked Mini&s;try, and that it is not utterly impo&s;&s;ible but there may be &s;uch in Times to come, my Argument &s;tands entire. God be thanked, we are now ble&s;t with a good King, and with the Pro|&s;pect of &s;uch for our Days, but cannot an&s;wer for tho&s;e who are yet unborn, &s;ince they will &s;till be Men, and therefore liable to Imperfection.</P>
<P>The <HI>Plebeian</HI> was hard &s;et by the An&s;wer of the <HI>Old Whig</HI> to his Arguments, That the <HI>Limitation of the Num|ber of the Lords wou'd run the Con&s;titution into an Ari&s;to|cracy,</HI> and has therefore very prudently &s;huffled the Con&s;i|deration of that Point under another Head, where he forgets the <HI>Old Whig</HI>'s Reply to what was urged again&s;t his Opinion in that Ca&s;e, &s;o that he has vi&s;ibly given up the Point which was mo&s;t material in his fir&s;t <HI>Plebeian.</HI> The <HI>Old Whig</HI>'s Re|mark therefore &s;till &s;tands out again&s;t him unan&s;wer'd; and plainly turns his own ill Con&s;equence upon him, by &s;hewing there is a vi&s;ible Tendency to an Ari&s;tocracy as the Con|&s;titution now &s;tands, which would be taken away by the Alteration propo&s;ed. But it is ungenerous to in&s;ult a baffled Adver&s;ary; I &s;hall therefore proceed to the next Particular in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>The <HI>Old Whig</HI> affirms that <HI>the Power of giving Mo|ney and rai&s;ing Taxes is confined to the Body of the Com|mons,</HI> and that <HI>all the Privileges together of the Lords are not equal to that One of commanding the Pur&s;e of the Community.</HI> The <HI>Plebeian</HI> allows the Con&s;equence, but cavils at the Po&s;ition, which is a received Maxim among the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> the Doctrine of the Hou&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="9">
of Commons in particular, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Practice of every Parliament in the Memory of Man. Let us now &s;ee what the <HI>Plebeian</HI> affirms in Contradiction to it, and by the way ob&s;erve whether he per&s;onates his Part well, and &s;peaks the Language of one who writes him&s;elf a <HI>Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons.</HI> The Author a&s;&s;erts, That <HI>whether a Money-Bill may not originally take its Ri&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Lords, is a Point never yet clearly given up by their Lord&s;hips, if he is not very much mi&s;in|formed.</HI> This Point, if I am not very much mi&s;informed, was never claimed by the Hou&s;e of Lords, and has not a &s;ingle Precedent in the Practice of that Body in the Legi&s;|lature.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 13.</NOTE> He afterwards a&s;&s;erts that <HI>the Commons have no more Power over their Fellow-Subjects E&s;tates than the Lords.</HI> Is not the Power of granting a Supply, fixing the Quantum of that Supply, appropriating every Part of it to particular U&s;es, and &s;ettling the Ways and Means for rai&s;ing it; is not this Power over their Fellow-Subjects E|&s;tates much greater than that of the Lords, who can neither add to, dimini&s;h, nor after any one of the&s;e Particulars? And if the Power of the Commons extends it &s;elf to all the&s;e Points, how can the Author further affirm, that <HI>all which is peculiar to the Commons in this Matter is, that they have hitherto been allow'd to chu&s;e what Tax they judged ea&s;ie&s;t for the People!</HI> But what Shadow of Rea&s;on is there for him to proceed in a&s;&s;erting, that <HI>every Day's Experience &s;hews us, that if the Lords differ in Opinion from the Com|mons, their Power is at an end</HI>; &s;ince, on the contrary, Ex|perience &s;hews us, that whenever the Lords have pretend|ed to &s;uch a Power, they have always been over-ruled by the Commons!<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 9.</NOTE> Our Author tells us <HI>the Concurrence of the Lords is as nece&s;&s;ary to a Money-Bill as to any other Bill.</HI> That is not deny'd; but he mu&s;t allow that the Lords Concurrence to a Money-Bill is not of the &s;ame Nature with their Concurrence to any other Bill, which they may undoubtedly change, amend, and return upon the Hands of the Hou&s;e of Commons for their Concur|rence in &s;uch Amendments as the Lords &s;hall think proper.
<PB N="9" REF="10">
Be&s;ides, to &s;hew the <HI>Plebeian</HI>&punc; how much the Pur&s;e of the Community is at the Command of the Commons, let him con&s;ider the Ca&s;e of a Vote of Credit, which is tran&s;act|ed wholly between the Soveraign and the Lower Hou&s;e. To this we may add, that the Soveraign him&s;elf, in his Speeches to Parliament, applies that Part which relates to Money to the Hou&s;e of Commons, di&s;tinct from that of the Lords; by which Method it is plain the Crown &s;up|po&s;es tho&s;e Privileges are ve&s;ted in the Hou&s;e of Commons, to which every Member of that Hou&s;e has always pretend|ed, excepting the pre&s;ent Author.</P>
<P>The <HI>Plebeian</HI> in the next Paragraph makes u&s;e of a very &s;ure and wi&s;e Method of confounding his Antagoni&s;t, by putting his own Sen&s;e upon a Pa&s;&s;age in that Author's Pam|phlet. The <HI>Old Whig</HI> repre&s;ents how dangerous it would be to our Con&s;titution, if the Crown, which is already po&s;|&s;e&s;t of a certain Means to over-rule one Branch of the Le|gi&s;lature, &s;hould ever be able to influence the Elections of a Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;o as to gain one to its Mea&s;ures; in which Ca&s;e, if Liberty was endanger'd in the Lower Hou&s;e, it could not make a Stand in the other. The <HI>Ple|beian</HI> perverts this Meaning after the following Manner; <HI>This Author,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>a&s;&s;ures us,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 10.</NOTE> <HI>that the Crown has Power enough to gain a Hou&s;e of Commons of what Complexion it plea&s;es</HI>; and after puzzling him&s;elf in his own voluntary Blunder, is di&s;plea&s;ed with the <HI>Old Whig</HI> for not propo&s;ing to cure an Inconvenience which he never affirmed to be in the Hou&s;e of Commons, as well as that which he proves to be in the Hou&s;e of Lords; &s;o that he would have had him quit the Subject which he had undertaken, to &s;peak of one which he had nothing to do with. But &s;up|po&s;ing the <HI>Plebeian</HI> had rightly &s;tated the Sen&s;e of the Au|thor, the Inconvenience in the Hou&s;e of Lords is that which is woven into its very Con&s;titution, and therefore at all times expo&s;es us to its ill Con&s;equences; whereas what the <HI>Plebeian</HI> &s;ugge&s;ts with regard to the Hou&s;e of
<PB N="10" REF="11">
Commons, is only extrin&s;ick, and accidental to that Body, if it ever happens in it.</P>
<P>It is not probable that this Di&s;pute between the <HI>Ple|beian</HI> and the <HI>Old Whig</HI> will la&s;t many Weeks: But if there was time to di&s;cu&s;s the whole Point, I think it may be &s;hown to a Demon&s;tration, that the Check of the Crown upon the Hou&s;e of Commons, which is the Power of <HI>Di&s;&s;olution,</HI> is, by infinite Degrees, a weaker Check than that it has in the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution upon the Hou&s;e of Lords, which is the Power of <HI>Adding</HI> to it what Num|ber, at what Time, and for what Purpo&s;e it plea&s;es: Nay, that the Power of Di&s;&s;olution is al&s;o in its Nature a Check upon the Hou&s;e of Lords as it di&s;&s;olves them in a Legi&s;lative Capacity, and may break the mo&s;t dangerous Cabals again&s;t the Crown, which are &s;uch as may be formed between the Leaders of the Two Hou&s;es. The&s;e two Points, if drawn out into &s;uch Con&s;iderations as naturally ri&s;e from them, wou'd fully e&s;tabli&s;h the Nece&s;&s;ity of three Branches in a perfect Legi&s;lature, and demon&s;trate that they &s;hou'd be &s;o far &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from each other, as is e&s;&s;ential to Legi&s;lative Bodies: Or, as the <HI>Old Whig</HI> has before ex|plained it, <Q>If one Part of the Legi&s;lature may any ways be inve&s;ted with a Power to force either of the other Two to concur with it, the Legi&s;lative Power is in Re|ality, whatever it may pretend to, divided into no more than two Branches.</Q></P>
<P>I have hitherto followed the <HI>Plebeian</HI> in his own Me|thod, by examining, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> his Replies to the Objections made by the <HI>Old Whig</HI>; and come now to his <HI>Second</HI> ge|neral Head, wherein he formally propo&s;es to <HI>con&s;ider the Argument as the Old Whig &s;tates it him&s;elf.</HI> And here I was not a little &s;urprized to find, that in&s;tead of an&s;wering the &s;everal di&s;tinct Arguments urged by that Author, in Defence of the Bill: as drawn from the Nature of Govern|ment in general; from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution; from its
<PB N="11" REF="12">
Effects on the Crown; on the Hou&s;e of Commons; on the whole Body of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commonalty; and from the ill Con&s;equences it wou'd remedy in the pre&s;ent Con&s;ti|tution; the <HI>Plebeian</HI> contents him&s;elf with attacking but one &s;ingle Argument of his Antagoni&s;t. Till the <HI>Plebeian</HI> &s;hall have an&s;wer'd tho&s;e other Points, I &s;hall take it for granted, that he gives them up. Not to multiply Words, I believe every Reader will allow me that an Author is not to be much regarded, who writes profe&s;&s;edly in An&s;wer to a Di&s;cour&s;e which proceeds on many Arguments, when he &s;ingles out the Argument only which he thinks is the weake&s;t; e&s;pecially when he fails in his An&s;wer even to that &s;ingle Argument. A famous <HI>French</HI> Author compares the imaginary Triumphs of &s;uch a kind of Di&s;putant, whom he was then dealing with, to tho&s;e of <HI>Claudius,</HI> which, in|&s;tead of being repre&s;ented by the &s;trong Towns he had taken, and the Armies he had defeated, were te&s;tified to the People of <HI>Rome,</HI> by a Pre&s;ent of Cockle-Shells that he had gather'd up on the Sea-Shore.</P>
<P>But to come to the Matter before us. The <HI>Old Whig,</HI> after having con&s;idered it in &s;everal Views, examines it with Regard to the whole Bulk of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commons. Un|der this Head he has the following Words. <Q>But the great Point, and which ought to carry the chief Weight with us in this Ca&s;e, is, that the Alteration now propos'd, will give &s;uch a mighty Power to the Bulk of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commons, as can be never counterbalanc'd by the Body of the Nobility.</Q> Now what the <HI>Old Whig</HI> here calls the Great Point with Regard to the Commonalty of <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Plebeian</HI> in&s;inuates he calls the Great Point with Regard to the whole Controver&s;y, and de&s;cants upon it accordingly. Whereas it is evident the Author in&s;i&s;ts upon many Points as Great as This in other Views of the Que&s;tion. The <HI>Old Whig</HI> affirms, that the <HI>Commonalty</HI> has infinitely more Wealth than the <HI>Nobility,</HI> which was the proper Con&s;ide|ration of this Place. The <HI>Plebeian</HI> returns for An&s;wer,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
that the <HI>Commonalty</HI> is indeed much richer than the <HI>Nobi|lity,</HI> but that the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> is not &s;o rich; which was not the proper Con&s;ideration of this Place. It is im|po&s;&s;ible for a Di&s;putant to lo&s;e the Cau&s;e, who is a Ma&s;ter of &s;uch Di&s;tinctions. I remember I was once pre&s;ent at an Univer&s;ity Di&s;putation, which was managed on the one Side by a notable <HI>Peripatetick.</HI> The Que&s;tion which he defended in the Negative was, <HI>Whether Comets are a|bove the Moon?</HI> The Sophi&s;ter being pre&s;s'd very hard by the Force of Demon&s;tration, very gravely extricated him|&s;elf out of it by the following Di&s;tinction. <HI>Comets,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>are Two-fold,</HI> Supra-lunar, <HI>and</HI> Sub-lunar. <HI>That</HI> Supra-lu|nar <HI>Comets are above the Moon I do allow; but that</HI> Sub-lunar <HI>Comets are above the Moon I utterly deny. And it is of this latter kind of Comets that the Que&s;tion is to be un|der&s;tood.</HI></P>
<P>The Fallacy of the <HI>Plebeian</HI>'s An&s;wer being thus far di&s;|cover'd, all that he further adds in his own way of arguing will be ea&s;ily confuted by unravelling the Matter which he has very artificially perplex'd. The <HI>Old Whig</HI> &s;uppo&s;es that every Lord in the Legi&s;lature, taken one with another, may be worth 5000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, in which, for Argument's &s;ake, every one knows his Conce&s;&s;ion has been va&s;tly too liberal. The <HI>Plebeian</HI> values every Member of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons at 800 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> one with another, in which 'tis plain he has been exceeding Scanty. Nay many are of Opinion that upon ca&s;ting up the whole Sum of Property that now re&s;ides in the Hou&s;e of Lords, it wou'd not exceed that which is in the Hou&s;e of Commons. If this Particular ap|proaches to the Truth, all the Arguments of a Superior Power ari&s;ing from its greater Property fall to the Ground of them&s;elves, as being rai&s;ed on a fal&s;e Foundation. To which I mu&s;t further add, that if this increa&s;ing Power &s;till continues in the Crown, the Property of the Hou&s;e of Peers will <HI>indi&s;putably</HI> &s;urmount that of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons; and that on the contrary, if the Bill pa&s;&s;es, it vi&s;i|bly
<PB N="13" REF="14">
tends to prevent the Impoveri&s;hment of the Hou&s;e of Commons in point of Property, and to fill it with Men of &s;uch E&s;tates, as in a few Years will be more than a Counter|balance to the Hou&s;e of Lords, even under this View.</P>
<P>But further to &s;hew the Weakne&s;s of the <HI>Plebeian</HI>'s Rea|&s;onings upon this Head, I will allow that the Hou&s;e of Lords enjoy at pre&s;ent, and may &s;till continue to enjoy, a greater Share of Property than the Hou&s;e of Commons. But not|with&s;tanding this Conce&s;&s;ion, to which the Nature of the Thing does not oblige me, it is &s;till evident that the immen&s;e Property which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the Bulk of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Com|mons, will render their Repre&s;entatives more powerful than the Body of the Lords. This will plainly appear from con&s;idering the very Nature of Repre&s;entatives; from tho&s;e Junctures which can po&s;&s;ibly give them an Occa&s;ion of ex|erting their Power; and from Matter of Fact.</P>
<P>It is implied in the very Nature of Repre&s;entatives, that they are back'd with the Power of tho&s;e whom they repre&s;ent: As the Demands of a Plenipotentiary, let his Per&s;onal Wealth or Power be as little as you plea&s;e, have the &s;ame Weight with them as if they were made by the Per&s;on of his Principal. I will beg leave to borrow from the <HI>Plebeian</HI> an Example of the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> which, as he makes u&s;e of it, has no manner of Analogy with the Subject of the Di&s;pute. Is not the whole Stock of that nu|merous Community under the Guidance of a few Directors? And will any one &s;ay, that the&s;e Directors have no other Influence on the Publick, than what ari&s;es to them from the Share which they per&s;onally enjoy in that Stock? The Author urges that the Peers are Principals, which in Reality is the rea&s;on why their Power is not to be apprehended in Oppo|&s;ition to that of the Commons; whereas were they only Repre&s;entatives of a Body immen&s;ely rich and numerous, they wou'd be&s;ide their own Per&s;onal Property have &s;uch a Support, as wou'd make them truly formidable. The
<PB N="14" REF="15">
whole Commons of <HI>England</HI> are the Principals on one &s;ide, as the Lords are the Principals on the other; and which of the&s;e Principals are arm'd with mo&s;t Power and Pro|perty?</P>
<P>To con&s;ider in the next place tho&s;e Junctures that can po&s;&s;ibly give them an Occa&s;ion of exerting their Power it is on both &s;ides &s;uppos'd to be in &s;uch Ca&s;es as will affect the Rights of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commonalty, in which Ca&s;e every Commoner of <HI>England</HI> is as much concern'd as any of their Repre&s;entatives. Thus if four <HI>London</HI> Citizens, to make the Ca&s;e exactly parallel, were deputed to maintain the Rights of their Principals, as Citizens, who can imagine that they wou'd not be &s;upported by the whole Power and Property of the City, and not be too hard for any two or three great Men, who had ten times their Per&s;onal E&s;tates? Now as the <HI>Plebeian</HI>'s Suppo&s;ition reduces things to the la&s;t Extremity, it can only take place in a Rupture, which is never likely to happen. And in that Ca&s;e, as the&s;e two great Bo|dies mu&s;t act &s;eparately, there is no room for con&s;idering how far the Concurrence of the Hou&s;e of Lords is nece&s;|&s;ary in a Money Bill, which entirely takes away the Author's Rea&s;oning in his 13th Page.</P>
<P>But Matters of Fact are the be&s;t Arguments. We both agree that Power ari&s;es out of Property, and the Author him&s;elf has given an In&s;tance of the Power of the Hou&s;e of Commons in having been able to effect the Ruin of the Monarchy and Peerage. Whence had the Commons this Power, but from being &s;upported by their Principals?</P>
<P>The <HI>Plebeian</HI> thinks he &s;trengthens his Point, by adding that the Lords are a fixt Body. To this I might reply, that the Principals of the Hou&s;e of Commons are as fixt a Body as the Lords; and therefore, however their Repre&s;enta|tives may vary, they will continue intent, from Age to Age, to a&s;&s;ert and vindicate their peculiar Rights and Privileges,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
unle&s;s we can believe that any Body of Men will act again&s;t tho&s;e two &s;trong Motives of Self-Intere&s;t and Self-Pre&s;er|vation. I might further venture to &s;ay, that Men of the greate&s;t Wealth and Weight in the Hou&s;e of Commons, are almo&s;t as &s;ure of a Seat there, as if it came to 'em by Inhe|ritance. But &s;uppo&s;ing the Hou&s;e of Lords never &s;o much fix'd, and &s;o manageable by two or three great Men (for which very rea&s;on Additions are very often made to 'em, which the Alteration wou'd prevent); we have &s;een that their United Power, if their Number is limited, can never be a Match for that of the Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;till &s;uch a Rupture, as the <HI>Plebeian</HI> all along imagines, in which each Body is to act &s;eparately for it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The Author, in the remaining part of his Pamphlet, ap|pears like every Writer that is driven out of all his Holds. He endeavours to &s;et the Crown, and the whole Body of Peers, upon his Adver&s;ary; accu&s;es him in effect of <HI>Scan|dalum Magnatum</HI>; nay, and gives very broad Intimations that he ought to be indicted for High-Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>I &s;hou'd not have given my &s;elf, or the Publick, all this Trouble, had I not been &s;o peremptorily call'd to it by the la&s;t <HI>Plebeian.</HI> I do a&s;&s;ure him, my Silence hitherto was not the effect of Old Age, as it has made me <HI>Slow,</HI> but to tell him the Truth, as it has made me a little <HI>Te&s;ty,</HI> and con&s;equently impatient of Contradiction, when I find my &s;elf in the right. I mu&s;t own however, that the Writer of the <HI>Plebeian</HI> has made the mo&s;t of a Weak Cau&s;e, and do be|lieve that a good one wou'd &s;hine in his Hands; for which rea&s;on I &s;hall advi&s;e him, as a Friend, if he goes on in his <HI>new Vocation,</HI> to take care that he be as happy in the Choice of his Subject, as he is in the Talents of a Pamphleteer.</P>
