<P>THE Sincerity of the Di&s;&s;enters VINDICATED, From the Scandal of <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity,</HI> WITH Some Con&s;iderations on a late Book, En|titul'd, <HI>Moderation a Vertue.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Defenders of <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> are at la&s;t come to a Point. They have given up the Cau&s;e &s;o far as ever the fir&s;t Oppo&s;er pu&s;ht it at them. The Au|thor of a Book, call'd, <HI>Moderation a Virtue,</HI> has very in|genuou&s;ly Acknowledg'd all that was de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>And, indeed, a Man of his Candor could do no le&s;s, &s;ince he is of too penetrating a Judgment not to know, and of too much Hone&s;ty of Principles, not to own that 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible to be Defended.</P>
<P>Wherefore I think it cannot give Offence either to him, or to any Body el&s;e, to Publi&s;h the Conclu&s;ion of the Ar|gument in his own Words, and to let all Men know,</P>
<P><HI>That 'tis Granted by the Di&s;&s;enters,</HI></P>
<P><HI>That to Conform to the Church of</HI> England, <HI>and receive the Sacrament, meerly to Qualify for a Civil Employ|ment, is a &s;candalous Practice, a Reproach to Religion, and Offen&s;ive to all good Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>If therefore, for the future, any Di&s;&s;enter &s;hall be Guil|ty of this &s;candalous, reproachful Practice, let no Man re|flect upon the Body of the Di&s;&s;enters for an Error of a &s;ingle Member, he is to bear the Burthen him&s;elf, for his Mi&s;take is his own, the Party di&s;owns the Practice.</P>
<P>But the Defenders of this Occa&s;ional Licen&s;e are like a re&s;olute Garri&s;on, who being Beaten out of a Town retire to the Ca&s;tle; the open and &s;candalous Conformity of &s;uch People who too notoriou&s;ly u&s;ed it as a Qualification for Ci|vil
<PB REF="3">
Employments, appearing too low a Step to bear a De|fence, they have politickly drawn in a great many hone&s;t, well-meaning Gentlemen to &s;ide with the thing, on account of a General Charity, and its being Lawful in its own Nature.</P>
<P>The Meaning is, that having brought People to be Re|concil'd to the thing in it &s;elf, it may look the le&s;s odious in the other Circum&s;tances of it.</P>
<P>But for what yet appears this Shift will fail too, and all that has been yet &s;aid, does not &s;eem to me to clear it up.</P>
<P>God forbid that I &s;hould &s;ay Conforming to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> ab&s;tractedly and &s;ingly con&s;ider'd, is a Sin. But I cannot &s;ee the lea&s;t Argument to prove what I alledge to be untrue, <HI>viz.</HI> That 'tis a Sin in a Di&s;&s;enter to Con|form to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or el&s;e his Di&s;&s;enting is a Sin, and he ought to Repent of one, or of the other.</P>
<P>This, I think, will appear, when all the Authorities for this Occa&s;ional Compliance are Examined, and, <HI>as I tru&s;t they &s;hall be,</HI> fairly Confuted.</P>
<P>This is what none of our Opponents have yet replied to, but continue to fetch a compa&s;s round it, and Reply to Things which really are not of &s;o much Con&s;equence in the Ca&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>Sincerity of the Di&s;&s;enters</HI> VINDICATED, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Argument again&s;t <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity,</HI> 'tis not improper to ob&s;erve, There are two Sorts of People blame the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters.</HI><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Their Brethren Di&s;&s;enters, who cannot Satisfy them&s;elves in the &s;ame Latitude of Principles.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Strict Conformi&s;t.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To me it &s;eems as nece&s;&s;ary to Examine the Dif|ferent Rea&s;ons of the&s;e Opponents, as it is to Examine the Lawfulne&s;s of the Fact; and as it is a part of the Di&s;pute which has not yet been brought upon the Stage, it may be very u&s;eful to bring Parties to a right Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>'Tis mo&s;t certain, That the&s;e two Parties do not Cavil at the <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> of the Di&s;&s;enters from the &s;ame Principle, nor with the &s;ame End and De|&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Stricter <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> Argues again&s;t it from a Con&s;cientious Di&s;like of the Practice; the <HI>Militant Church-man,</HI> from a Di&s;like of the Con&s;equence; the <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> is again&s;t the Communicating, as a Religi|ous
<PB N="2" REF="5">
Error; the <HI>Church-man,</HI> as a Politick One; the <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> Explodes it as a Sin again&s;t the Reputation and Intere&s;t of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI>; the <HI>Church-man,</HI> as a Sin again&s;t the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Church</HI>; the <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> as it weakens the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and prepares their Mem|bers to fall off, and Po&s;terity to Conform totally, to what their Fathers Conform'd to <HI>Occa&s;ionally</HI>; the <HI>Church-man</HI> di&s;likes it, as it lets the <HI>Whigs</HI> into Places, and State Employments, and weakens the Party that are to carry on other De&s;igns.</P>
<P>As the difference of De&s;ign is manife&s;t, &s;o the Ar|guments on both &s;ides exceedingly differ.</P>
<P>The <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> Charges the <HI>Occa&s;ional-Man</HI> with Breach of his relative Engagements to Church Socie|ties, de&s;erting his fir&s;t Principles, Condemning his fir&s;t Di&s;&s;ent, and the like: But the <HI>Church-man,</HI> with Hypocri&s;y, Tricking and Undermining the Govern|ment, Defeating the Laws, and the like.</P>
<P>As to the la&s;t I cannot but blame the Heat of the&s;e Men, who cry out upon the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> as Cheats and Hypocrites; tho', at the &s;ame time, I cannot approve the practice of <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> as &s;uch.</P>
<P>As to the Trick put upon the State by the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters,</HI> it is either an unju&s;t Charge, or it is but a Re|turn in kind, &s;ince 'tis plain that the Te&s;t was it &s;elf a Trick, being pretended to be not again&s;t them, but the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and is by a &s;train of Words bent at the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to &s;erve a Turn: And allow it had been the Sence of the Law, 'tis plain, by the Con&s;equence, it was not made to bring the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> to Church, but to keep them out of the Government, which &s;ince the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> have prevented by complying, they are angry the Trick is di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The Author of the&s;e Sheets freely owns him&s;elf an Oppo&s;er of <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity,</HI> but 'tis becau&s;e he
<PB N="3" REF="6">
would have the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> pre&s;erve what he has often advanc'd in their Favour, <HI>viz. That they are really</HI> Di&s;|&s;enters <HI>for Con&s;cience Sake,</HI> and this he conceives can|not be reconcil'd to an Occa&s;ional complying with that from which they had before Di&s;&s;ented, and on account whereof they could ju&s;tify a Separation from the E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Church.</P>
<P>This being premis'd, the Defenders of this Practice are manife&s;tly in an Error in their manner of Ju&s;tify|ing it, &s;ince they &s;eem to bend the &s;trength of their Replies again&s;t the Friendly Oppo&s;er, and not again&s;t the furious A&s;&s;aults made upon their Integrity, tho' the la&s;t will appear the much ea&s;ier Enemy to be over|come.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be ob&s;erv'd in the late Author of a Book; Entituled, <HI>Moderation a Virtue,</HI> and I cannot but let that Gentleman know, that from his Title the World expected an An&s;wer to tho&s;e Hot Gentlemen who rally the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> with Hypocri&s;y, and State Tricks, in this Ca&s;e, while the principal Part of his Argument lies only again&s;t the &s;tricter <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> as &s;uch, tho' pointed at the <HI>Church-man,</HI> le&s;&s;ening the Dif|ference between them and the Church, in order to make <HI>Conformity</HI> &s;eem a thing of le&s;s Moment than it is, for|getting that the le&s;s the Difference is, the le&s;s the Rea|&s;ons for a Schi&s;matical Separation will appear, and the Grounds and Rea&s;ons by which their Di&s;&s;enting is to be defended, appear the le&s;s ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>Of &s;even Heads of his Arguments I am therefore rea|dy to leave the la&s;t four for &s;ome body el&s;e to an&s;wer, and only ob&s;erve a little on the fir&s;t Three what the Arguments amount to, which Vindicate the <HI>Occa&s;ional Communion of a Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> as in its &s;elf Lawful.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">And fir&s;t, as to his Precedents, he is pleas'd to prove that <HI>this</HI> Occa&s;ional Conformity <HI>is no new thing, but has the Warrants of unconte&s;table Precedents.</HI></P>
<P>Nor indeed, is his Argument new, any more than the <HI>Communion,</HI> but what has been before &s;tarted, and lately very happily an&s;wer'd: But as this Author is far from being unworthy an An&s;wer &s;o as he writes both &s;trenuou&s;ly, and yet mode&s;tly, he de&s;erves an An&s;wer of Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>I have already noted a very hone&s;t Conce&s;&s;ion gran|ted by this Author, <HI>that he does not ju&s;tify &s;uch as Con|form meerly for a Place, but owns it as a &s;candalous Practice.</HI></P>
<P>This is granting all the real Ground of the Di&s;pute. For, as &s;trictly &s;peaking, it may be po&s;&s;ible that a Man may really Conform Occa&s;ionally to the Church, with|out offence to his Con&s;cience, yet to run it up to the Extreame&s;t Nicety, and avoid the real Offence taken at the Practice, is waving the Argument, and falling upon another never propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Before therefore we come to the Argument, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that a Man may do a thing without Offence to his Con&s;cience, which may be really Sinful, and his Con&s;cience not being duly inform'd, does not make the thing Lawful in Practice, what ever it may be to him.</P>
<P>But as the fir&s;t Occa&s;ion of this Di&s;pute was chiefly bent at &s;uch, who really Conform to qualify them&s;elves for State Employments, it remains to Examine, whe|ther the&s;e Gentlemen charg'd, have really done &s;o, or no; and &s;ince naming of Names is very improper, and not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in this Ca&s;e, I &s;hall only lay down one Ca&s;e in which, I think, without Breach of Charity, a Man may be allow'd to gue&s;s, that a Confor|ming is meerly for the Qualification.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8">When a Man, who is a profe&s;t <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> join'd in Communion with a &s;eparate Congregation, and either never, or not for a long time, did Communicate with the Church, but upon &s;ome pro&s;pect of Preferment, &s;ome Election, Place, Profit, or Perqui&s;it, &s;hall Con|form to the Church of a &s;udden, and &s;o very remarka|bly, as to time, <HI>viz. the Eve of an Election, or the like,</HI> that all Men mu&s;t gue&s;s at the rea&s;on of doing it, and after this the Per&s;on never to Conform again, but up|on like Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Shall any Man be judg'd for believing &s;uch a Man Conforms for the Place; &s;hall this be call'd the <HI>Moderate Con&s;cientious Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> who this Character will di&s;tin|gui&s;h from others, let them find out among his Neigh|bours who know him, I &s;hall go no farther.</P>
<P>To ju&s;tify this Conformity much time has been &s;pent, and labour lo&s;t, for I mu&s;t account it lo&s;t, and this Au|thor has granted me the Clau&s;e, which is a Token of his Hone&s;ty, for really it is not to be defended. But here &s;eems to lye an opportunity now to cover this &s;candalous Practice with the pretence of Con&s;cience, and 'tis but being a lit|tle wary as to Circum&s;tances, and we may all, for the future, be Con&s;cientious <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;cientious Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> both together.</P>
<P>And to make way for this, Endeavours are us'd fir&s;t to prove the general Practice Lawful; I confe&s;s the particular practice above nam'd was always the princi|pal De&s;ign, but &s;ince it is come &s;o far, as that one mu&s;t be defended, or <HI>at lea&s;t conceal'd by the other,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how this covering will be too &s;hort for the Bed, and the Shame and Nakedne&s;s will appear; and as the particular Conformity we are upon is fairly &s;uppre&s;t, I &s;hall Enquire, if the General will hold water by it &s;elf. And fir&s;t for Precedents, I cannot but wonder at
<PB N="6" REF="9">
tho&s;e which our Author pre&s;ent us with, <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bap|ti&s;t,</HI> and our Saviour.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> &s;ays he, was an Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;t to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church, he went to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> thrice a Year to Wor&s;hip, but held &s;eperate A&s;&s;emblies in the Wilder|ne&s;s, and Taught and Baptiz'd.</P>
<P>'Tis plain <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> was no <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> at all, he was <HI>a Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> approv'd him, <HI>for all Men held him for a Prophet,</HI> but held all the Parts of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Wor&s;hip entire; he Preach'd, in the Wilderne&s;s, but what did he &s;ay, <HI>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand</HI>: He neither Di&s;&s;ented from the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Wor&s;hip, nor taught others to do &s;o, but as a Fore-runner, who went to prepare the way, told them the Go&s;pel, the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and Saviour was at hand; the fini&s;hing of the old Wor&s;hip was at the Door, and the Son of God coming to Erect his Kingdom in the World. What was all this to Di&s;&s;enting? He preach'd neither a-again&s;t their Doctrine nor Ceremonies, he Conform'd to them all him&s;elf, only &s;uch as would receive his Bap|ti&s;m, <HI>which was only a Token of their Faith in the Ble&s;&s;ed Ti|dings he brought them,</HI> receiv'd it; but they were not taught, in the lea&s;t, to Di&s;&s;ent from the <HI>E&s;tabli&s;h'd Wor&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>With what rea&s;on can it be concluded from hence, that Chri&s;tianity had its Ri&s;e in <HI>Occa&s;ional, Conformity,</HI> the Conclu&s;ion of this Argument &s;avours of more Levity than this Author any where el&s;e di&s;covers, and &s;eems a little too much a Sophi&s;m, for a Man, of his Judgment, to offer, in rea&s;oning upon a Subject &s;o &s;erious.</P>
<P><HI>Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the Author of our Holy Re|ligion, was al&s;o an</HI> Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;t, God forbid I &s;hould dare to write &s;o. Our Lord was a &s;trict com|pleat <HI>Conformi&s;t</HI> to the Ceremonial In&s;titution, in every part of it that was Divine, but abhor'd the Innovati|ons
<PB N="7" REF="10">
of the <HI>Jews.</HI> And he continued Conforming even to the la&s;t Pa&s;sover, which he Eat with his Di&s;ciples, and not only was &s;o him&s;elf, but he in&s;tructed his Di&s;ci|ples in the like, <HI>They &s;it in</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>Seat, what&s;oever there|fore they bid ye do, that do ye. Think not I am come to De&s;troy the Law, I am not come to De&s;troy the Law, but to fulfil.</HI> 'Tis true, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord did preach again&s;t the Innovations which the Traditions of the <HI>Elders,</HI> and the &s;everal divided Sects had brought into their Religion: he reproach'd them with making his holy Hou&s;e of Prayer a Den of Thieves; with teaching for Doctrine the Com|mandments of Men, and the like; but this was no more Di&s;&s;enting from the Legal In&s;titution, which was the E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Wor&s;hip, than the Prophet <HI>Elijah</HI>'s over-turning the Altars of <HI>Baal,</HI> and &s;laying their Prie&s;ts, was a Di&s;&s;en|ting, for if purging the Church from Idols be Di&s;&s;en|ting, &s;uch it was; our Saviour taught, but all his Teachings were full of Expo&s;itions of the Law, and Comments upon the Prophets, and quoting them where they led unto him&s;elf. Nor did he omit the Wor&s;hip of their Temple and Synagogues, tho' he took all o|ther Opportunities; indeed, to teach the People in all places, but he &s;ubmitted to Circumci&s;ion, Eat the Pa&s;s|over at the Appointed time, and his Mother perform'd her proper Offerings of Purification.</P>
<P>At the Death of our Lord, he pronounc'd the great Work of Redemption fini&s;h'd; the Law was thence re|&s;olv'd into the Go&s;pel; the Veil of the Temple rent in twain, and the <HI>Levitical</HI> In&s;titution began to cea&s;e; I do not &s;ay entirely cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord having Offer'd up him&s;elf a Sa|crifice Once for all, the Apo&s;tles never were found &s;eeking to any Propitiation, but that of Faith in his Blood.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="11">But in the Interval between the E&s;tabli&s;hing Chri&s;tiani|ty, and the entire Di&s;&s;olution of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Rites, as a Re|ligion the Apo&s;tles, as <HI>Jews</HI> born, are found in a promi&s;cuous Occa&s;ional Exerci&s;e of both; but what is to be gather'd from it, only this, That it remains to Examine, whe|ther the Law expir'd at once, or by Gradations: If it Expir'd at once, when that Time was; if Gradually, when it arriv'd to a total Demi&s;e.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Levitical</HI> In&s;titution expir'd at once, and that point of Time was when our Lord &s;aid, <HI>It is Fini&s;hed,</HI> then it is as Lawful to Conform to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Wor&s;hip, on Occa&s;ion, now, as it was then.</P>
<P>If not at this Time, but Gradually, then the fir&s;t In&s;titution being all of Divine Original, and <HI>One</HI> only a &s;hadow of the <HI>Other,</HI> the Go&s;pel being the thing Ty|pified, and the Law the Type; it was neither a Di&s;&s;ent, nor a Conforming, for the <HI>Jews</HI> to Exerci&s;e religious Wor|&s;hip in either, becau&s;e the Religion was but the &s;ame thing, and the Ceremonies of the New were not yet Settl'd. But I do not &s;ay &s;o of the Chri&s;tians who were <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>But our Author, who has &s;aid all this, comes off a|gain with this Caution, <HI>I am not concern'd to prove the Ca&s;e of our Di&s;&s;enters to be Parallel with the&s;e; but it ap|pears that Occa&s;ional Communion may, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, be Lawful.</HI></P>
<P>But, in my Opinion, if our Ca&s;e is not Parallel, any one might be allow'd to Ask, What's this to us? If the Ca&s;es are not alike, the Arguments are not alike.</P>
<P>I cannot think 'tis ju&s;t to infer, That becau&s;e <HI>Occa|&s;ional Conformity</HI> may, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, be Lawful, there|fore 'tis Lawful in our Ca&s;e, unle&s;s our Ca&s;e, and tho&s;e <HI>&s;ome Ca&s;es,</HI> agree: For, if &s;o, then 'tis as Lawful for us Occa&s;ionally to Conform to the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, or to
<PB N="9" REF="12">
the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church. For, by our Author's Argument, a Chri&s;tian has nothing to do but to Examine, whether he thinks it Lawful in his Ca&s;e, or no.</P>
<P>But not one Man has yet attempted to Explain this Que&s;tion, <HI>How the Di&s;&s;enting can be Ju&s;tified, when we can &s;o ea&s;ily Conform</HI>: The making a Breach in the E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Church, a Schi&s;m in the General Union; The Breaking off from a General Communion; The Erect|ing private Churches, a &s;eperate Di&s;cipline; and all this for Things which Occa&s;ionally we can Comply with.</P>
<P>If any <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> can ju&s;tify a <HI>Conformity,</HI> no <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> can be of greater moment than Peace, Union, Charity, Order, Obedience to Princes, Laws, and the like. If we have not thought the&s;e &s;ufficient Occa&s;ions; Let us &s;ee which are Greater.</P>
<P>But after all, pray let us Examine this Great Article of Conformity in the Apo&s;tles, and I am of Opinion it &s;hall come out fairly, that really the Apo&s;tles were not Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;ts at all.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t in General, I Affirm none of the Apo&s;tles are ever found Conforming to any thing which they had declar'd their, di&s;&s;ent from before; but let us Ex|amine, wherein they did actually Conform, and why.</P>
<P>If any Man will but give him&s;elf leave to Di&s;tingui&s;h a little in the Ca&s;e, he may arrive at the Truth of this Matter with a &s;mall difficulty: He need only di&s;tin|gui&s;h between the Practice of the Apo&s;tles as <HI>Jews,</HI> born under the Obligation of the <HI>Levitical</HI> Law, and continuing &s;till under more Obligations than Chri&s;tian Pro&s;elytes, and ob&s;erve, that as Jews they found them|&s;elves under &s;ome Legal Duties which the Gentile Chri|&s;tians were ab&s;olutely Free from: And therefore all that we call <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity,</HI> was only doing what they were bound in Con&s;cience to do, and had never Di&s;&s;ented from.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="13">The Circumci&s;ing of <HI>Timothy,</HI> and the &s;everal Parts of the Law St. <HI>Paul</HI> Conform'd to, were nothing but what, <HI>as Jews,</HI> they were obliged to, and their Faith in the Sa|viour did not at all take off the Obligation from tho&s;e who were <HI>Hebrews</HI> born, and were then alive, they were &s;till <HI>Zealous of the Law, Acts</HI> 21.20. and the Obliga|tion <HI>to be &s;o</HI> continued to them. For this Rea&s;on the Circumci&s;ion of <HI>Timothy</HI> is ju&s;tified, becau&s;e his Mo|ther and Grandmother were <HI>Hebrews,</HI> whereas it is ex|pre&s;ly &s;aid St. <HI>Paul</HI> refus'd to Circumci&s;e <HI>Titus,</HI> becau&s;e his Father was a <HI>Greek.</HI></P>
<P>By this it appears, that Circumci&s;ion was Admini|&s;tred in <HI>Timothy,</HI> not as an Occa&s;ional Conformity, but as a Duty, and a Thing which <HI>Timothy,</HI> as a Son of <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Parents, ought to do; and it rather &s;eems &s;trange it was not done before.</P>
<P>To Prove this, &s;ee what is, in the &s;ame Ca&s;e, &s;aid to the Chri&s;tians, who were <HI>Gentiles</HI> by Birth, even the &s;ame Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>If they were Circumci&s;ed, Chri&s;t &s;hould profit them nothing.</HI></P>
<P>The Matter therefore re&s;ted upon &s;uch a Conformity as was requir'd of them as <HI>Jews,</HI> and which the Death of Chri&s;t could not Di&s;&s;olve the Obligation of, to them who were then alive, becau&s;e the Force of them began in their being Born of the Stock of <HI>Abraham.</HI></P>
<P>But if the Opponent, in this Matter, can &s;how me one In&s;tance in the whole Scripture, of any Chri&s;tian, whether Apo&s;tle, or Elder, who being born a <HI>Gentile,</HI> did, by this Authority, Conform to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Cere|monies, even in the lea&s;t Article, then I'll throw up this Point; and if not, then I &s;hould be glad to meet with the &s;ame Candor, either to have my Argument An&s;wer'd or Granted.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">This Matter will further appear, if any Man will but take the pains to Examine the Scriptures in the Ca&s;e: The Hi&s;tory of the Apo&s;tles coming to <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI> &s;eems to me to make it plain, in the 21<HI>&s;t.</HI> of the <HI>Acts v.</HI> 20. the Brethren come to St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and tell him, That the Multitude of Converted <HI>Hebrews</HI> had Entertain'd a Scandal at his Conver&s;ation, from Re|ports rais'd upon him, <HI>That he taught the</HI> Jews <HI>to for|&s;ake</HI> Mo&s;es's <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>Now it appears, that this was really a fal&s;e Report, by the care taken to Convince the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Believers of it, Ver&s;e the 23.24. <HI>Do therefore this that we &s;ay unto thee. We have four Men which have a Vow on them, them take and Purify thy &s;elf with them, and be at char|ges with them that they may &s;have their Heads.</HI></P>
<P>It remains to Enquire what was all this for: It was not, as is pretended, a Conforming on Occa&s;ion to pre|vent giving Offence, but it was a Practi&s;ing that which was &s;till Lawful, that the &s;candalous Report might be Confuted, and the next Words make it out, <HI>viz. That all may know that tho&s;e Things whereof they are In|formed concerning thee are nothing,</HI> that is, that 'tis all fal&s;e and &s;candalous, and that tho&s;e <HI>Jews,</HI> who Belie|ved, were &s;till to walk orderly, and to keep the Law.</P>
<P>That therefore the Chri&s;tians, who were Converted from the <HI>Jews,</HI> were thus obliged to keep the Law is plain, and 'tis clear the keeping the Law could be no Sin, be|cau&s;e of its Divine Original.</P>
<P>But let us look to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and let <HI>them</HI> &s;how me one Act of Occa&s;ional Conformity among them, Ver&s;e the 25th. <HI>as concerning the Gentiles, who believe</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="15">
<HI>we have written, and concluded that they ob&s;erve no &s;uch thing</HI>; and at the &s;ame time that the Apo&s;tle Circumci&s;ed <HI>Timo|thy,</HI> becau&s;e his Mother was a <HI>Hebrew,</HI> as is Noted before, he refus'd to Circumci&s;e <HI>Titus</HI> becau&s;e his Parents were <HI>Greeks,</HI> having &s;aid of the <HI>Gentiles, That if they are Cir|cumci&s;ed, Chri&s;t &s;hall be to them of no effect.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, I think, this mighty Difficulty is over, the Occa&s;ional Conformity of the Apo&s;tles at an end, and the Uniformity of the Chri&s;tian Church in its fir&s;t In&s;ti|tution, Vindicated.</P>
<P>Our Commentators, &s;ay, God indulg'd the <HI>Jews</HI> the liberty of U&s;ing, or not U&s;ing, the <HI>Ceremoniale</HI> of the Law, as a thing wholly Indifferent; and as what, upon the general Revolution which Religion came under at the Death of our Lord, was nece&s;&s;ary to Reconcile the <HI>Jews</HI> to the Change.</P>
<P>Others are of Opinion, it was a Burthen on the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Believers, which the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were freed from, but they oblig'd to.</P>
<P>And this &s;eems plain from <HI>Acts</HI> 15.28. <HI>It &s;eem'd good to the Holy Gho&s;t, and to us, to lay upon you no greater Bur|then than this, that ye ab&s;tain from meats offer'd to Idols, and from Blood.</HI> This was to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> but the keep|ing of the Law <HI>was a Burthen</HI> yet le&s;t on the <HI>Jews,</HI> who were turn'd Chri&s;tians, and then in being.</P>
<P>But be which of the&s;e Opinions <HI>we will</HI> in the Right, both allow that it only re&s;pected the <HI>Jews,</HI> and them no further than tho&s;e then alive; and that the <HI>Gentile</HI> Converts were not allow'd the lea&s;t Shaddow of a Com|pliance, or Occa&s;ional Conformity; No, not to the lea&s;t, and mo&s;t Indifferent Ceremony. And tho' the Connexion between <HI>Circumci&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> was plain, and they were equally Seals of the Covenant, yet for a
<PB N="13" REF="16">
<HI>Gentile</HI> Chri&s;tian to have accepted Circumci&s;ion, had been to make the Death of Chri&s;t of no effect to him.</P>
<P>And, indeed, as the Death of Chri&s;t had a po&s;itive Effect upon the Law to Abrogate and Di&s;annul it, the <HI>Jews,</HI> then in being, might be under Vows and Orders, which their Embracing the Faith of Chri&s;t did not De|&s;troy; but if after the Death of Chri&s;t any Chri&s;tian, who was not a <HI>Jew</HI> born, might, on occa&s;ion. Conform to the old Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> it can never be An&s;wer'd why it is le&s;s Lawful now.</P>
<P>The Inference therefore drawn by the Author <HI>p.</HI> 9. that by this it appears Occa&s;ional Communion, in &s;ome Ca&s;e, may be Lawful, where Con&s;tant Communion would be a Sin, cannot be true; that is, it cannot be true from tho&s;e Premi&s;es, becau&s;e the Fact of tho&s;e Premi&s;es does not appear to be true, either that <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or any of the Apo&s;tles, were Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;ts.</P>
<P>As to the Sacrifices and Supplications offered up at the Temple for foreign Princes, or Heathen Emperors and Powers; fir&s;t, I am not Satisfied that it was not an Innovation, or Tradition, many of which crept into the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Wor&s;hip, till they became of equal Authority to the Law it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But if it were true, it &s;eems no more an In&s;tance of Occa&s;ional Conformity, than it would be in the Di&s;&s;enters of <HI>England</HI> on a formal Reque&s;t from the Em|peror of <HI>Germany,</HI> or the Pope, to keep a &s;olemn Fa&s;t to Pray for them, this might be Occa&s;ional Conformity in the Emperor to us, but not in us to him. It was a publick Acknowledgment in the <HI>Romans,</HI> and a Te&s;ti|mony to the Verity of the <HI>Jews</HI> Religion, but it was no Conforming to the <HI>Romans,</HI> in offering Sacrifices to

God for the Welfare of their Emperors; and I cannot but admire for what u&s;e, in this Argument, this Ca&s;e is brought, being, in my humble Opinion, nothing at all to the Matter.</P>
<P>From hence I mu&s;t lay down, That Occa&s;ional Con|formity is not &s;ufficiently prov'd by Precedents and Au|thorities of Scripture.</P>
<P>Our Author's &s;econd Head is, to prove, <HI>That the Prin|ciples of the con&s;cientious Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;t are</HI> Chri|&s;tian <HI>and</HI> Catholick, <HI>and will Ju&s;tify him before God and Man.</HI></P>
<P>This Argument, I think, lies a little unfair, for the Man is not rightly de&s;crib'd, who is this con&s;cientious Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;t.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion before me &s;eems to lye thus, Whether a Thing that would otherwi&s;e be Unlawful, is Ju&s;tifiable becau&s;e the Per&s;on acting it is not Reprov'd in it by his Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The Man is brought in with Extraordinary Quali|fications, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Not of a Mercenary Spirit, or Sini&s;ter In|tention to the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church: He believes it a True Church, Owns her Mini&s;try, Acknowledges her Liturgy to be &s;ound for Sub&s;tance."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But becau&s;e he conceives the Di&s;&s;enting Churches to be True Churches, and their Mini&s;ters generally Men of real Piety, he thinks him&s;elf oblig'd to hold Communion with them."</Q> Now, where &s;hall we find this Man? This is not the Di&s;&s;enter we are upon.</P>
<P>With Submi&s;&s;ion, this Man never was a Di&s;|&s;enter, he who, in his Con&s;cience, believes all the above&s;aid of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and has no more to &s;ay why he Di&s;&s;ents, may very well ju|&s;tify Conforming to the Church, but I am &s;ure he can

never ju&s;tify Di&s;&s;enting from them. Shall we make a Schi&s;m in the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Church, only becau&s;e we be|lieve the Di&s;&s;enting Churches to be True Churches, and their Mini&s;ters good Men? This will never Ju|&s;tify us.</P>
<P>But our Author goes one, <HI>p.</HI> 11. to Enumerate the Things for which the Di&s;&s;enter quits the Church Com|munion, as
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A Defective Di&s;cipline.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A Promi&s;cuous Communion, contrary to the Rules of the Go&s;pel, and the Primitive Practice of the Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. An Impos'd Liturgy, to an entire Lo&s;s of the Gift of Prayer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Human Mixtures in the Mini&s;tration, as the Cro&s;s, Surplice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The Obligation on a Chri&s;tian, to &s;eek the be&s;t Guides for his Soul.</ITEM>
</LIST>
This is a Satyr upon the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the True and Real Grounds of a Di&s;&s;enter's Separation; and he that Di&s;&s;ents on the&s;e Grounds, can never Con|form upon Occa&s;ion; if he does, how he can, at the &s;ame time, Ju&s;tify his Di&s;&s;enting, remains with me a Que&s;tion yet unan&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>All the In&s;tances brought from Dr. <HI>Bates,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bax|ter,</HI> Mr. <HI>Corbett,</HI> Mr. <HI>Tallents,</HI> have &s;ome particular Exceptions, at fir&s;t the great Di&s;pute in their Ca&s;es is between Lay Conformity, and Conformity as Clergy-Men; as Lay-men they could Conform, as Clergy-men they could not, and preach'd in &s;eperate Churches, on|ly
<PB N="16" REF="21">
becau&s;e the Church having &s;hut the Door again&s;t them, they thought them&s;elves oblig'd, as they were Lawful ordain'd Mini&s;ters, not to de&s;i&s;t from the Work of their Office, though Man had impos'd &s;ome Things on them which they could not comply with, but that they were under an indi&s;pen&s;ible Nece&s;&s;ity to preach the Go&s;pel, and to Exerci&s;e their Duty, tho' they were &s;i|lenc'd by the Law.</P>
<P>I think the third Head is &s;omething of Kin to the &s;e|cond; for this is to &s;how that <HI>the Difference between the Church of</HI> England, <HI>and the</HI> Di&s;&s;enter, <HI>is but little.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;olemnly Appeal to the Searcher of all Hearts, that I am none of tho&s;e who are for making the Difference greater than it really is.</P>
<P>And with the &s;ame Sincerity, I prote&s;t I wi&s;h it was not &s;o great as it is, and heartily wi&s;h I could Conform wholly to the Church.</P>
<P>And I wi&s;h the Church, to try the Sincerity of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> would come to a Temper; abate us what, without Prejudice to Doctrine, or Di&s;cipline, might be abated, and conde&s;cend &s;o far to the Tender Con|&s;ciences of us their weaker Brethren, that all the <HI>Di&s;|&s;enters</HI> of a Catholick Spirit might come in, and join with them.</P>
<P>But as I would not make the Difference wider, &s;o I cannot make it le&s;s; I cannot bring my Di&s;&s;enting Rea|&s;ons to &s;uch Punctilio's, and reduce them all to Trifles, without reproaching my &s;elf with a needle&s;s and unchri|&s;tian Separation: For I cannot but &s;ay, God forbid I &s;hould be found making, or keeping up a Breach in the Chri&s;tian Union and Charity of the Church for little Matters, and divide in Communion for Trifles.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="22">Our Author &s;ays, we Agree in all the E&s;&s;entials of Chri&s;tianity, and differ only in Accidentals; and <HI>the great things, in which we agree, &s;hould be more powerful to unite us, than the le&s;&s;er, in which we differ, &s;hould be to divide.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot think I do the Author Inju&s;tice if I &s;ay, if this be true, no Man can ju&s;tify Di&s;&s;enting from the Church; and if it be any thing but a &s;trong Argument for a con&s;tant Conformity, then I am at a lo&s;s to un|der&s;tand plain <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>We agree in all the great Things, and differ only in Small; the great Things, in which we agree, ought to be more powerful to make us Conform, than the &s;mall Things &s;hould be to make us Di&s;&s;ent, that is, we ought to Conform.</P>
<P>If this be true, why do we not Conform? How can we ju&s;tify our Di&s;&s;enting.</P>
<P><HI>They agree, and none of them &s;cruple a Moderate Epi&s;co|pacy,</HI> &s;ays our Author.</P>
<P>This I refer to the whole Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who are all <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and have &s;uffer'd as much for a Di&s;&s;enting from Prelacy, as ever the Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI> did for Di&s;&s;enting from <HI>Popery.</HI> If the <HI>Engli&s;h Di&s;|&s;enters</HI> do not &s;cruple Epi&s;copacy, then I confe&s;s I am at a Lo&s;s to know why we di&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>But then we are led to this Argument by the word <HI>Moderate Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> and <HI>Moderate Epi&s;copacy,</HI> either this <HI>Moderate Di&s;&s;enter</HI> is no <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> or this <HI>Moderate E|pi&s;copacy</HI> is no <HI>Epi&s;copacy.</HI> Indeed the Church-men do look on Arch-bi&s;hop <HI>U&s;her</HI>'s Model to be no <HI>Epi&s;co|pacy</HI> at all.</P>

<P>I wonder any Gentleman of &s;o much Learning and Candor, can &s;ay our Prai&s;es and Prayers are the &s;ame for Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Nay even this very Author employs very good Rea|&s;ons for our not complying with the Liturgy; nor thinking it Lawful to impo&s;e Forms upon the Mini&s;try, and tye them up to them.</P>
<P>The Difference about Ordination of Mini&s;ters which this Author is pleas'd to &s;ay is incon&s;iderable, is the next; and I cannot agree that this is a &s;mall Difference, and all he &s;ays on this Head, &s;eems to me to be a good Rea&s;on, why the Church &s;hould agree to allow an Ordination by <HI>Presbyters,</HI> but no rea&s;on to &s;atisfy the <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> with Epi&s;copal Ordination.</P>
<P>I believe there are five Rea&s;ons to be given why the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould allow, and accept of an Or|dination by <HI>Presbyters,</HI> to one, why the <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> &s;hould &s;ubmit to Epi&s;copal Ordination.</P>
<P>And if it be only this One, 'tis a great One, which even our Author has Quoted, <HI>viz.</HI> that Ordination by <HI>Presbyters,</HI> without the <HI>Dioce&s;an,</HI> is own'd by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to be <HI>Orthodox</HI> in that great Act of Parliament, by which the Reformation was E&s;tab|li&s;h'd in <HI>England</HI> in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time 13. <HI>Eliz.

<P>As to the re&s;t of this Book, I leave the <HI>Church-Men</HI> to An&s;wer it if they can.</P>
<P>As about the multitude of Broils, Parties and Con|tentions, the Church has within her &s;elf, how Incon&s;i|&s;tent with her own Canon and pre&s;crib'd Rules ma|ny of her Members act, the&s;e are mo&s;t True, and all the re&s;t of his Heads I readily Grant as his fourth Head, <HI>That employing</HI> Di&s;&s;enters <HI>is &s;o far from weakening, that it &s;trengthens the Church.</HI></P>
<P>This he may more ea&s;ily per&s;uade me to believe, than he will the Church-men <HI>of the high Party,</HI> who rail at it.</P>
<P>Fifth, <HI>That</HI> Occa&s;ional Conformity <HI>is an Advantage to the Church, and weakens the</HI> Di&s;&s;enters: The latter I believe, and therefore would not have the <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> be concern'd in it, and wonder if the Author believes &s;o, how he that is a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter</HI> can argue for the Practice, <HI>the</HI> Di&s;&s;enters <HI>ought to thank him for it.</HI></P>
<P>I doubt not but this Occa&s;ional Conforming of the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in this Age, is a Prologue to a total <HI>Confor|mity</HI> in the next, and leads our Po&s;terity to quit that Di&s;&s;enting wholly, which they &s;aw their Fathers could quit as they found Occa&s;ion; and I de&s;ire him, in his next, to tell us what Advantage it is any way to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters.</HI></P>
<P>Sixth, <HI>That the late Bill again&s;t</HI> Occa&s;ional Con|formity <HI>would have been highly Prejudicial to the Church.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="25">I believe &s;o, and to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> too; and therefore the Lords di&s;mi&s;t it, as not proper by any means to pa&s;s into a Law.</P>
<P>His la&s;t Argument, that <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> from National E&s;tabli&s;h'd Churches, have always been Employ'd by mo&s;t Nations and Governments, I grant, and he has effectually made it appear.</P>
<P>But all this leaves the matter where we found it.</P>
<P>That Conforming to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as it has been lately Practis'd by the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> for the qualifying them&s;elves for Places and Employments in the Government, is a Practice unwarrantable from the Scripture, Pernicious to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> them&s;elves, and will be fatal both to their Reputation and In|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>And tho' really <HI>Occa&s;ional Communion</HI> does not &s;eem Clear to me on any &s;core whatever,</P>
<P>Yet, this is out of doubt, and the Author I have been naming, readily grants it me. That tho' <HI>Occa|&s;ional Conformity</HI> Ab&s;tracted might be ju&s;tify'd, yet, this is no ju&s;tifiable Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Since then, the Di&s;pute will end as to this Occa|&s;ion, tho&s;e who are willing to be concern'd in any further Debate of it, would do well to lay down what Occa&s;ions are &s;ufficient to ju&s;tifie Conforming to the Church, and what Circum&s;tances are requi|red to &s;uch an Occa&s;ion; that the hone&s;t Con&s;cien|tious <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;t,</HI> if &s;uch a Man can be, may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> and the whole Party may not bear the Reproach.</P>
<P>And, becau&s;e this Point has never been yielded before, I cannot di&s;mi&s;s it without &s;ome Remarks,
<PB N="21" REF="26">
which I judge Natural from the Premi&s;es, and Nece&s;|&s;ary to the Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>As fir&s;t, 'tis apparent many of the Di&s;&s;enters who have thus Conform'd, have never in the whole Cour&s;e of their Lives Conform'd before; no, not when Per&s;ecuted by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> have &s;uffer'd Impri&s;onment, Confi&s;cation of Goods, and &s;everal other publick Op|pre&s;&s;ions, and never would Conform: But when In|vited to Places of Honour or Profit, have Complied, thinking the Obtaining a good Place, a &s;ufficient Oc|ca&s;ion to Invite them; when neither the Laws, nor the Per&s;ecution it &s;elf could be thought an Occa&s;ion to Compel.</P>
<P><HI>Now,</HI> if as is own'd, <HI>Moderation a Vertue,</HI> p. 7. <HI>This be a Reproach to Religion, and Offen&s;ive to all good Chri|&s;tians,</HI> then they ought to avoid the Practice, or to Regulate it, &s;o as that it may not appear to be done meerly as a Qualification.</P>
<P>Another Remark I cannot but make, That if <HI>Oc|ca&s;ional Conformity</HI> be Lawful, then it cannot be True, as too many have &s;aid, That this Di&s;pute will bring Per&s;ecution upon the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>For 'tis no Breach of Charity, to &s;ay none of tho&s;e Gentlemen who can Voluntarily Conform, will ever &s;uffer Per&s;ecution for not Conforming; and this Con|firms the ill Actings of tho&s;e who did &s;uffer before, and Conform'd afterwards: For 'tis plain, by their Suffer|ing, their Con&s;ciences were again&s;t it before; and 'tis as plain, by their Complying, that the Advantage &s;mother'd the Scruple.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="27">A Man can by no po&s;&s;ible Arguing ju&s;tifie &s;uffering per&s;ecution, for that which he can, with a &s;atisfied Con&s;cience, comply with.

<P>And 'tis for this Rea&s;on I would entreat tho&s;e Gen|tlemen to let us know what are ju&s;tifiable Occa&s;ions, and what are not.</P>

<P>Let &s;uch Men remember <HI>Origen,</HI> who having been guilty of <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> only in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ive manner he po&s;&s;ibly could, as but &s;uffering the Heathen Prie&s;t to put a little Frankincen&s;e into his Hand, and dropping it into the Fire, not &s;o much as owning it to be a Sacrifice, much le&s;s owning the Idol to be a God; and &s;ee his Repentance, how many Years was he left in the Agonies of De&s;pair, and how does he bemoan him&s;elf on that account, calling him&s;elf Apo&s;tate from Chri&s;t, and unworthy of Martyrdom.</P>
<P>The Primitive Hi&s;tory of the Church gives us in|numerable In&s;tances of the Con&s;tancy and Exactne&s;s of the Chri&s;tians in this Point.</P>
<P>And I only forbear to enumerate them, becau&s;e they are to be found in the fir&s;t Vol. of <HI>Fox</HI>'s Acts and Monu|ments of the Church, in <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> and in all the Hi&s;to|rians of tho&s;e Times.</P>
<P>But it may be an&s;wer'd, That this was a Conformi|ty to what was ab&s;olutely unlawful, Idolatrous, and abominable, which is not to be alledged here.</P>
<P>To this I rejoin, he that Di&s;&s;ents from the Church of <HI>England</HI> does it, becau&s;e he cannot in Con&s;cience Com|ply, or el&s;e he can have no ju&s;tifiable Rea&s;on for Di&s;&s;ent|ing. Now all things are unlawful to him, which his Con&s;cience is not &s;atisfied about, and tho' not equal|ly abominable, are &s;o much &s;o, as that no Man can comply with them &s;afely. But to obviate the Ob|jection

wholly, we will come nearer to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England</HI> to her Glory be it &s;poken, is founded in the numerous throng of ble&s;&s;ed Mar|tyrs and Confe&s;&s;ors, who have left their Memory and Example as a la&s;ting Te&s;timony again&s;t <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity,</HI> even in the &s;mall, and &s;ome of them indif|ferent things.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed Bi&s;hop <HI>Hooper</HI> when he came to the Stake to &s;eal with his Blood, the Te&s;timony of his Faith, and when in the la&s;t Agonies of his Life, the Queens Par|don was offer'd upon Terms, very much &s;hort of a total Conformity, only to &s;et his Hand to an acknow|ledgement; cried out before it was read; <HI>If you Love my Soul away with it.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now look abroad in Times more Modern, and within our Memory, and what are all the new Converts as they are call'd in <HI>France,</HI> but <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The Fire of Per&s;ecution having burnt up the Prote|&s;tant Church, all tho&s;e who could not &s;tand the brunt, not make their e&s;cape, or &s;uch who&s;e Religion had not force enough with them, to make them &s;uffer the lo&s;s of all, what did they do, they fly to this very refuge <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity,</HI> and if the Arguments are Examin'd, they are much the &s;ame with Ours.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tants do not deny but 'tis po&s;&s;ible to be &s;av'd in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and they may, upon occa|&s;ion therefore Conform in &s;ome things, while, at the &s;ame time, they re&s;erve their Minds and Hearts entire|ly to the true Wor&s;hip; and <HI>Naaman,</HI> the <HI>Syrian,</HI> &s;ay they, was &s;uch an <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;t,</HI> to whom the Prophet gave a tacit Licence, when, upon the propo&s;al, he reply'd, <HI>Go in Peace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="30">Here is the only In&s;tance of <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity,</HI> which exactly reaches our Ca&s;e that I remember; and I &s;ee nothing can be &s;aid to ju&s;tifie Ours, which may not ju&s;tify Theirs, only, that indeed the diffe|rence is not &s;o great between <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> and <HI>Prote|&s;tant,</HI> as between <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> and <HI>Roman Catho|lick.</HI></P>
<P>But if the difference here be great enough to ju&s;ti|fie a Di&s;&s;enting for Con&s;cience &s;ake, the Argument is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of kneeling in the Street when the <HI>Roman</HI> Proce&s;&s;ions come by, is as parallel to our Impos'd Ceremonies, as any thing in two different Religions can be, and yet, thus they Occa&s;ionally Conform, and plea&s;e them&s;elves with fancying that they do not do it as an Act of Wor&s;hip. But our <HI>Martyrs</HI> in Queen <HI>Mary's</HI> time, frequently Sacrific'd their Blood on more minute Circum&s;tances than that, as not &s;uffering a Child to be Baptiz'd, tho' by Force, in the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Glover,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Lane, John Field,</HI> throwing down the Rood of <HI>Dover</HI> Court, and the like.</P>
<P>Now let any Man Examine the <HI>Occa&s;ional Confor|mity</HI> of the <HI>Hugonots</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and tell me, if the Con&s;equence is not very probable to be this, that one Age may make all their po&s;terity <HI>Roman Catholicks, Vice Ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>And what is the Opinion their Brethren, who are in Bani&s;hment, have of them. <HI>Come les Per&s;ons, qu on Avez Vendue leur Religion,</HI> as Per&s;ons that have &s;old their Religion, People who have Tainted their Principles and te&s;tify'd that they cannot part with their E&s;tates to pre|&s;erve their Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="31">They are &s;till Prote&s;tants on their Inclination, and they plea&s;e them&s;elves, that this <HI>Conformity</HI> is ju&s;tify'd by the occa&s;ion of it, and let them that like it follow their Example.</P>
<P>I am not concern'd here to prove that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> is no true Church, that <HI>Popery</HI> is <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and that the Ca&s;es therefore do not agree. The Di&s;|&s;enting in both Ca&s;es is for Con&s;cience &s;ake, and there|in the Ca&s;es are Parallel: We were once all of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and had never remov'd from thence, but from Scruples of Con&s;cience, and we are now Di&s;&s;enters from the Church of <HI>England</HI> from &s;cruple of Con&s;cience: We own the Church of <HI>England</HI> to be a true Church, and we do not deny Salvation to the Members of the <HI>Roman</HI>; there are things in the Church of <HI>England</HI> we cannot comply with, and there are &s;ome things in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> which we could comply with, but there are things in both we Di&s;&s;ent from, and <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> to tho&s;e very things, can be ju&s;tified from very few rea&s;ons on one &s;ide, which will not hold good on the other.</P>
<P>This in &s;hort then is the plain Conclu&s;ion of this Matter. <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> to a Church from which we have &s;eparated, and in tho&s;e things for which we &s;eperated, <HI>viz.</HI> Communion does not appear to be lawful or ju&s;tifiable in a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> nor are there any Pre|cedents for it in the Scripture.</P>
<P>But <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> being practis'd as a Quali|fication for Civil Employments, is a Reproach to Reli|gion, and &s;candalous to the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t is fairly acknowledg'd by the Author of <HI>Moderation a Vertue,</HI> and I think the fir&s;t is made plain in the&s;e Sheets.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="32">Of the whole Argument then this is the &s;um.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> who are yet of the Opinion, it is not unlawful in it &s;elf, &s;hould take care to practi&s;e it &s;o, as that tho&s;e Circum&s;tances of Qualification may not be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P N="2">2. They &s;hould &s;tate what are &s;ufficient Occa&s;ions to ju&s;tifye our Conforming, to what at other times we have Di&s;&s;ented from, and give us Scripture Authorities to prove them.</P>
<P N="3">3. They ought to let us &s;ee how they can ju&s;tifye Di&s;&s;enting at all, if they can defend Conforming again.</P>
<P N="4">4. They ought to prove that the Conformity, or <HI>Occa&s;ional Conformity</HI> (as they call it) of Chri&s;t, and the Apo&s;tles, was to &s;uch things as were meerly of Mans' Appointment, or purely to &s;uch as were Divine; or whether they Conform'd to any thing they Di&s;&s;en|ted from before.</P>
<P>But till &s;ome of the&s;e Points are &s;ettled, I cannot but think the whole practice of it a Scandal to the <HI>Di&s;&s;en|ters,</HI> ruinous to their Intere&s;t; and tends to the redu|cing them all or their Po&s;terity at lea&s;t to an ab&s;olute total Conformity, or at be&s;t a general Indifferency in Matters of Religion.</P>
