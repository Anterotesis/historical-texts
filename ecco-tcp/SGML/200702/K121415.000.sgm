<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Account which the Reader will here find, of the mo&s;t extraordinary ROGUE that ever yet Suffer'd in <HI>England,</HI> was pick'd up, for the mo&s;t Part at &s;everal Times, from his own Relations and Stories of him|&s;elf; which are the be&s;t Authorities that can be produced for Things which, according to the Iniquity and Nature of them, were tran&s;acted with &s;uch extreme Caution.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="4">And it is certain, that the greate&s;t Part of his dark Proceedings wou'd &s;till have continu'd a Secret to the World, had it not been, that in his gay Hours, when his Heart was open, he took Plea&s;ure in recounting his pa&s;t Rogueries, and, with a great deal of Humour, bragg'd of his biting the World; often hinting, not without Vanity, at the poor Under&s;tanding of the greate&s;t Part of Mankind, and his own &s;uperior Cunning.</P>
<P>And indeed, when we con&s;ider that it is not a Man's Grandeur, or high Station in the World, but the &s;trange Adventures of his Life, and his Art and Conduct in the Manage|ment of Things, which gives us a Curio&s;ity of looking into his Hi&s;tory&mdash;I &s;ay, when this is granted, we need make no Apology for collecting the&s;e Materials, and offering them to the Publick&mdash;for here they will meet with a Sy&s;tem of Politicks unknown to <HI>Machiavel</HI>; they will &s;ee deeper
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
Stratagems and Plots form'd by a Fellow without Learning or Educa|tion, than are to be met with in the Conduct of the greate&s;t State&s;man, who have been at the Heads of Go|vernments.</P>
<P>And indeed, when Things are right|ly compared, it will be found that he had a more difficult Game to play; for he was to blind the Eyes of the World, to find out Tricks to evade the Penalties of the Law; and on the other Side, to govern a Body of People who were Enemies to all Go|vernment; and to bring tho&s;e under Obedience to him, who, at the Ha|zard of their Lives, acted in Di&s;obe|dience to the Laws of the Land&mdash;This was &s;teering betwixt <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Cha|rybdis</HI>; and if he had not been a very skilful Pilot, he mu&s;t long &s;ince have &s;plit upon a Rock, either on one Side or the other.</P>
<P>To conclude: We have not taken &s;o much Pains to multiply a Number
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
of Stories, which wou'd have &s;well'd the Bulk of the&s;e Sheets, and increas'd the Price, and perhaps tired the Reader; we have only endeavour'd to trace him thro' his &s;everal Steps and Gradations, to account for the Policy and Cunning of his Manage|ment, and relating only &s;uch Facts as have not yet been made publick con|cerning him.</P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>P.S.</HI> As to the Paper he left be|hind him, and which we have annex'd to this Edition, it was given me by a Per&s;on, who being of his Acquaint|ance, was admitted frequently to his Company after his Conviction, and which he a&s;&s;ures me he had from his own Hands; the Reverend Gentle|man there mentioned, whom I know nothing of, can be&s;t tell whether he had &s;uch a De&s;ign of communicating him&s;elf to the Publick in that manner, and there I leave it.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF <HI>JONATHAN WILD,</HI> From his BIRTH to his DEATH.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_JONATHAN WILD</HI> was born of very hone&s;t Parents in the Town of <HI>Wolverhampton</HI> in the County of <HI>Stafford.</HI> His Father was not rich; however, he provided hand&s;omly for his Family while he lived, by his Trade, which was that of a Carpenter: But he dying, and
<PB N="2" REF="8">
leaving four or five &s;mall Children for the Widow to bring up and &s;ub&s;i&s;t, 'tis no won|der if their Education was no better taken Care of. As for <HI>Jonathan,</HI> he &s;hew'd early Signs of a forward Genius, and, whil&s;t a Boy, would commit a thou&s;and little Rogueries among tho&s;e of the &s;ame, or a &s;uperior Cla&s;s, in which he di&s;covered a ready Wit, and a Cunning much above his Years, tho' the&s;e Actions did not extend to robbing, or any &s;uch Crime; but I mean little collu&s;ive Tricks, which &s;erv'd to impo&s;e upon his own Companions, who had a le&s;s Faculty of di&s;|cerning than <HI>Jonathan</HI> had.</P>
<P>At the u&s;ual Age, when young <HI>Jonathan</HI> had been in&s;tructed to a moderate Degree of Learning, &s;uch as Writing and Accounts, he was put 'Prentice to a Buckle-maker, whom he &s;erv'd &s;even Years hone&s;tly enough; when that Time was expired, he carry'd on a little peddling Bu&s;ine&s;s him&s;elf in the &s;ame Way; but <HI>Jonathan</HI> wanted Application, which is generally ob&s;erv'd to be the Fault of Men of brisk Parts: Work and he were too much at Variance for him to thrive by his Trade; he &s;eem'd to follow it only at a Di&s;tance, often playing the Loo&s;e, wandering from one Ale|hou&s;e to another, with the very wor&s;t, tho' the merrie&s;t Company in the Place; and was particularly fond of the &s;trolling Actors that now and then frequented that Country.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="9">After this Manner <HI>Jonathan</HI> liv'd three or four Years, leading a Life of Plea&s;ure, di&s;turb'd with nothing, unle&s;s it was now and then at the Noi&s;e of a Drum, which he had as great Antipathy to as &s;ome Folks to Chee&s;e or a Cat. This was in the Heighth of the late War between <HI>France</HI> and the Confederates, when the Officers went down into the &s;eve|ral Counties for Recruits for <HI>Flanders,</HI> for which Kind of Service Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> had perhaps more Aver&s;ion than for any other Thing in Life; this was not for want of Courage, as we &s;hall prove in the Cour&s;e of his Hi&s;tory; but he thought a Man of Stratagem might pu&s;h his Fortune &s;ome better Way than by &s;tanding to be &s;hot at, and therefore 'twas nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould employ the utmo&s;t Cunning to avoid it, which however <HI>Jona|than</HI> could never have done, but by a Trick which he was more beholden to Nature for than Art; this was a Knack of di&s;locating his Hip-bone, which he could do without Pain, and thereby render him&s;elf a Cripple, and repo&s;e it in its Place again without Trouble, whenever he pleas'd; this was particularly u&s;eful to him, and which he con&s;tantly per|form'd whenever his unlucky Stars brought him within Sight of a red Coat, which he us'd to pa&s;s by in &s;o decrepid and deform'd a Po&s;ture as never fail'd to move Pity in the Beholders towards &s;o mi&s;erable an Object; and he was no &s;ooner out of Sight of 'em,
<PB N="4" REF="10">
but he walk'd as upright and as firm as any Man.</P>
<P>In the Cour&s;e of <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Trading, he vi&s;ited &s;ome Market-Towns to put off his Wares, as other Dealers did, at which Time he us'd to hire a Hor&s;e of his Neighbour's, (for <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Stock would not amount to one of his own;) and at a certain Time when Trade grew bad on his Hands, he &s;ells his whole Cargoe for what he could get, and rides up the Hor&s;e to <HI>London,</HI> in&s;tead of re|turning home to <HI>Wolverhampton</HI>; and the Owner heard nothing of his Bea&s;t, till 'twas &s;old, and all the Money &s;pent.</P>
<P>While <HI>Jonathan</HI> was &s;pending, in Gaiety and Plea&s;ure, the little Fortune he had ac|quir'd by the Sale of his own Stock, and his Neighbour's Hor&s;e, he got acquainted with &s;everal Per&s;ons of both Sexes, who were Peo|ple of Merit, in their Way; by who&s;e Inte|re&s;t, and the Vivacity of his own Parts, he was recommended to an Employment of Tru&s;t, in which he acquitted him&s;elf very hand&s;omely, con&s;idering the Corruption of the Times; but after a while, <HI>Jonathan</HI> find|ing it rather a Po&s;t of Honour than Profit, re&s;ign'd, and went down into his own Coun|try again. The Employment I mean, is that of a Bailiff's Follower; the Qualifications of which are Vigilance, Sagacity, Patience, Quick|&s;ightedne&s;s, <HI>cum multis aliis,</HI> which our <HI>Jona|than</HI> had frequent Opportunities of exerci&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="11">One of the fir&s;t Vi&s;iters <HI>Jonathan</HI> had upon his Return to <HI>Wolverhampton,</HI> was Mr. &mdash;, who lent him his Hor&s;e; to whom he open'd his Ca&s;e, letting him know that he was not one Farthing the richer by living at <HI>London,</HI> that he had &s;pent every Groat, and if he threw him into Pri&s;on, he would lo&s;e his Money, but that if he would favour him &s;o as to give him Time, he would pay for his Hor&s;e at a Shilling in the Pound <HI>per</HI> Month, till the whole was paid; and he &s;hould apply him&s;elf with A&s;&s;iduity to his own Bu&s;ine&s;s, to enable him to make good the&s;e Conditions; which the Creditor con|&s;idering, came into, and &s;o the Agreement was made.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wild,</HI> pur&s;uant to the above Terms, made two Payments at the Time they be|came due, but neglecting the third for a Fort|night or three Weeks, Mr. &mdash; gave <HI>Jon|athan</HI> a gentle Dun, telling him at what time the Month was up, and &s;o forth, but was very much &s;urpriz'd to find that Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> was &s;o far from making any Excu&s;e for his Omi&s;&s;ion, that he told him plain|ly he &s;hould pay him no more Money, and wonder'd at his A&s;&s;urance of making De|mands on him. <HI>Why,</HI> &s;ays the Creditor, <HI>did not you run away with my Hor&s;e, &s;ell him at</HI> London, <HI>and put the Money in your own Pocket? I did &s;o,</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Jonathan, but that affair was &s;ettled by an Agreement be|tween</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="12">
<HI>us that I &s;hould pay you &s;o much Mo|ney by Monthly Payments, in Con&s;ideration thereof; therefore that Cau&s;e is at an End. Very well,</HI> reply'd the Creditor, <HI>why don't you pay me according to that Contract then? No,</HI> quoth <HI>Jonathan, that Contract is ob&s;o|lete and of none effect. How &s;o?</HI> &s;ays the Creditor. <HI>Why you'll allow,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Jonathan, that Articles of Agreement, or Contracts, not fulfill'd, are broken, and Articles once broken, cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t afterwards: Now our Articles are broken,</HI> continued he, <HI>for I have made but two Payments, when there are three due long ago, therefore I owe you nothing.</HI></P>
<P>I mention this Story to &s;hew that <HI>Jona|than</HI> had a Genius for the Study of the Law; and had not his Practice taken another Turn at fir&s;t, I don't know whether, better or wor&s;e, as it is practi&s;ed of late, he might have been as eminent, and made as great a Figure as &s;ome of his Countrymen.</P>
<P>It was not long after this, that <HI>Jonathan</HI> found the making of Buckles too mecha|nick an Employment for him; his Soul was too great to be confin'd to &s;uch &s;ervile Work; and what was wor&s;e, he ea&s;ily perceiv'd he had Occa&s;ion for more Money than his Hands could procure him in that narrow Way of Bu&s;ine&s;s; therefore he &s;purn'd at the Trade, and re&s;olv'd, &s;ome how or other, to transfer the Labour from his Hands to his Head, as being the mo&s;t likely Means of getting a Livelihood fit for a Gentleman.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="13">Big with Hopes, he &s;et out for <HI>London</HI> once more; but as if he threw him&s;elf en|tirely upon Fortune, and re&s;olved to court her Favours, he begun his Journey on foot, and with no more than nine Pence in his Pocket; and the fir&s;t Day he was &s;o lucky as to meet with the Godde&s;s in the &s;ame &s;hape the Poets de&s;cribe her, <HI>viz.</HI> That of a Woman, travelling on the Road. The Lady was on Hor&s;eback, but however &s;he was &s;o good-natur'd as to let <HI>Jonathan</HI> keep Pace with her for three or four Miles, till by a little Conver&s;ation they grew intimate, and acquain|ted with each other's Circum&s;tances: She told <HI>Jonathan</HI> &s;he was an itinerant Doctre&s;s and cur'd People of all Di&s;tempers; that &s;he had been riding about the Country for the Good of the Publick, and was then going to <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI>; whereupon <HI>Jonathan</HI> being in a merry Humour ask'd her Opinion concern|ing his Leg and Thigh, which he pre&s;ently put out in the manner before mentioned; the Gentlewoman alighted from her Hor&s;e, and handling <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Parts, &s;he found his Hip-bone was out of its Socket, a great Ex|uberance on the back Part thereof, and his Knee and Foot turn'd almo&s;t behind him.</P>
<P>She was amazed to &s;ee this &s;udden Altera|tion, without being &s;en&s;ible of the Cau&s;e, and was very much troubled to know what &s;he &s;hould do with the poor Fellow in that Condition; but <HI>Jonathan</HI> pre&s;ently put her
<PB N="8" REF="14">
out of Pain, de&s;ired her to mount her Hor&s;e and he would accompany her into Town. He thereupon replaces the Joint, and walks along before her with great Briskne&s;s and A|gility. When &s;he was thoroughly inform'd of the Trick, &s;he intimated how u&s;eful this Deceit might be made to them both, if he would leave it to her Management; and all the Trouble he &s;hould be at, was to lie a Bed for a Fortnight, and eat and drink what|ever he had a mind to. Upon which &s;he let him into a Secret, that &s;he knew no more of Phy&s;ick or Surgery than her Hor&s;e, and only pretended to it for a Livlihood.</P>
<P>It may be imagin'd, that <HI>Jonathan</HI> was not difficult to be wrought on to &s;uch good Purpo&s;es, for he was never an Enemy to Eating and drinking in his whole Life; ac|cordingly the Plan was laid, and <HI>Jonathan</HI> hopp'd into Town in the Evening in the Cir|cum&s;tances of a poor decriped Beggar-man.</P>
<P>The Doctre&s;s &s;et up at the be&s;t Inn in <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> ask'd for a Room, and call'd the Landlord, telling him, &s;he found a poor mi&s;erable Object upon the Road, that ask'd Alms of her, which &s;he pre&s;ently relieved, &s;eeing him in a Condition that render'd him u&s;ele&s;s to the World, and burthen&s;ome to him&s;elf, adding that &s;ince he might be able, if his Lamene&s;s could be cured, to get an ho|ne&s;t Livlyhood by his Labour, 'twas a Thou|&s;and Pities he &s;hould not be taken Care of.
<PB N="9" REF="15">
The Landlord could &s;ay nothing to that, 'twas the Pari&s;h's Bu&s;ine&s;s where he was born, he &s;aid, who &s;hould take Care of him? &s;ays &s;he, if you have any eminent Surgeon in Town, a Man of Honour and Probity, that will undertake his Cure, I will be at the Ex|pence of it my &s;elf, and give him a &s;uitable Reward. The Landlord Commended her Ladi&s;hip's Charity, and <HI>Jonathan</HI> pray'd a|loud for his Benefactre&s;s.</P>
<P>On Mr. <HI>B&mdash;,</HI> a Surgeon, was &s;ent for, to whom Madam declared her &s;elf in like manner; and the Surgeon took a Survey before all the Hou&s;e of the Part affected: He &s;aw the Nature of his Lamene&s;s, and therefore only ask'd <HI>Jonathan</HI> how long ago this Misfortune happen'd to him? He an|&s;wered, in a whining Tone, <HI>About eight Years</HI>; and thereupon relates a plau&s;ible Story of his falling off a Tree in a Country Village, where no help was to be met with, and his Mo|ther being a poor Woman had not where|withall to pay a Doctor, and the like; but pretended to be very much ca&s;t down, when the Surgeon, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Gen|tlewoman, &s;aid, <HI>Madam, it would be no le&s;s than a Robbery to take your Money, for there's no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;erving him, the Bone hav|ing been &s;o long mi&s;plac'd has contracted a new Situation, and the Head of the Bone has formed a new Socket &s;o formidable, that 'twould be unnatural now to remove it thence,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="16"><HI>&s;o that we mu&s;t let it re&s;t as it is.</HI> This did not &s;eem to &s;atisfy the Gentlewoman, &s;he was &s;ure, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>the Limb might be reduc'd to its proper Place, with Care taken, if he would apply Fomentations, and other topical Medi|cines to the Part, for the Relaxation of the Ligaments,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>in Preparation for the Re|duction.</HI> This was di&s;puted &s;ome Time with Warmth, between the Male and the Female Surgeon, till it ended, as often Arguments do, in a Wager of fifty Guineas; and the La|dy her &s;elf was to take the Matter into her own Hands.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Patient was blooded, and then put ito a warm Bed: Stupes were made of a thou&s;and Herbs, and the Fomen|tation apply'd, or pretended &s;o to be, &s;everal times a Day. Mr. <HI>B&mdash;</HI> vi&s;ited him once in twenty four Hours; and the Gentlewo|man continued with him all the while for ten Days together; in which time hone&s;t <HI>Jo|nathan</HI> acted his Part &s;o well that he roar'd him&s;elf hoar&s;e, for the Pain he underwent (as it was thought) in this Extraordinary Ope|ration. At length, one Morning, as Mr. B&mdash; the Surgeon, our Quack Doctre&s;s, and three or four of the Town (for the Affair had made &s;ome Noi&s;e) were coming up Stairs, they heard the Patient, in&s;tead of groaning and making other di&s;mal Cries, as he us'd to do, &s;inging whi&s;tling, and what not; &s;o they all bur&s;t into his Chamber, and pre&s;ently
<PB N="11" REF="17">
ask'd the Occa&s;ion of his Mirth; <HI>Jonathan</HI> told them he never knew &s;o much Plea&s;ure in all his Life-time, for now he &s;aid he was as free from Pain as ever a one in the Room.</P>
<P>The &s;ly Doctre&s;s de&s;ir'd to be inform'd how and at what time the Pain left him? He an&s;wer'd, that <HI>about three a Clock that Morning (not having &s;lept for four Nights before) he fell into a Do&s;e, and dream'd that two Angels lifted him out of Bed, and car|ried him thro' &s;everal Regions, of which he could give no Account, and &s;et him down up|on a fine Bank of Flowers, on the Side of a Rivulet; on the other Side of which were beautiful Walks, plea&s;ant Groves, and curi|ous Water-works, and in the Center of all, a Pavillion of Ivory, of extraordinary Work|man&s;hip, particularly the Sculpture; the Roof was adorn'd with Birds of all kinds, inlaid; and on the In&s;ide a Throne of pure Gold, where &s;at his kind and good Benefactre&s;s. At the Sight of her,</HI> continued <HI>Jonathan, I ro&s;e up in Ha&s;te, thinking to &s;wim the Rivulet, when a Noi&s;e like Thunder awaken'd me, and I found my &s;elf in this Bed, in per|fect Health and Ea&s;e.</HI> The cunning Gentle|woman cry'd out, <HI>at that In&s;tant went the Bone into its Place.</HI> With that they turned down the Bed-cloaths, and found <HI>Jonathan</HI> a whole Man, to the great Surprize of all the Company.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="18">This extraordinary Cure was look'd upon as a kind of Miracle: Mr. <HI>B&mdash;</HI> believ'd it as &s;uch, paid the Money, (<HI>viz.</HI> fifty Gui|neas) and clear'd the Ca&s;e up to every Body from any Imputation of Deceit. <HI>Jonathan</HI> in two or three Days came Abroad, but limp'd a little; and Madam Doctre&s;s gave publick Notice that &s;he would &s;tay a Week in that Town, for the &s;ake of the di&s;ea&s;ed Poor of the Country, for whom &s;he would make up &s;ome Papers of Powders that &s;hould cure them of all Di&s;orders, and make it the healthie&s;t Part in the whole Kingdom, for which &s;he would take nothing of them but what the Medecines co&s;t her out of her Poc|ket, <HI>according to the Cant of all Quacks.</HI></P>
<P>The News run, like that of a great Victory gain'd over the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and People of all Conditions, Age and Sexes, came into <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> &s;o that <HI>Jonathan</HI> could not pound Brick-du&s;t fa&s;t enough for Sale; the Price of a &s;mall Paper of which, with a Mixture of Brim&s;tone and &mdash;, came but to &s;ix Pence.</P>
<P>By this Stratagem the Woman's Fame was &s;o rais'd, that when <HI>Jonathan</HI> and &s;he compu|ted their Gains, they found after all Charges were deducted, that they were much about 100 <HI>l.</HI> in Pocket, with which they &s;et out early in the Morning, and arriv'd at <HI>London</HI> &s;afely in three Days following. Here <HI>Jona|than</HI> liv'd a merry Life as long as the Money
<PB N="13" REF="19">
la&s;ted, and being &s;educed by the Plea&s;ures of the Town, had no Thought of getting more till urg'd thereto by Nece&s;&s;ity. But now an unlucky Accident happen'd, which &s;eem'd to give an ill turn to his Affairs, for his Lady <HI>Doctre&s;s</HI> took it into her Head to fall out with him; whether it be that &s;he was jealous of his having &s;ome new Amour, (for <HI>Jonathan</HI> was always a great Man among&s;t the Ladies) or whether &s;he could not bear his Extravagance, is a piece of Hi&s;|tory we cannot clear up; but let it be which it will, there aro&s;e &s;o furious a Quarrel be|twixt them, that <HI>Jonathan</HI> was laid a&s;ide and oblig'd to &s;hift for him&s;elf. He was after this Footman to one Mr. <HI>Daniel</HI> a Barri&s;ter of Law, in who&s;e Service he &s;pent &s;ome Time; in which nothing remarkable happening, we pa&s;s over in Silence. A little Time after he was arre&s;ted in an Action of Debt; and he being de&s;titute both of Credit and Friends, cou'd meet with no Body who would venture to bail him, &s;o that he was thrown into the <HI>Compter,</HI> where he lay a con&s;iderable Time.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Jonathan</HI> laid the Foundation of all his future Greatne&s;s; for it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>Compter</HI> is the Place where com|mon Thieves and Pickpockets taken in the City, are fir&s;t carried as &s;oon as they are apprehended: <HI>Jonathan</HI> took care to culti|vate an Acquaintance and Intimacy with them all, and as they are an enterprizing
<PB N="14" REF="20">
Body of Men, there &s;eem'd to a kind of Sympathy betwixt their Natures and that of <HI>Jonathan,</HI> &s;o that they &s;oon crept into one another's Secrets; he became acquainted with all their Tricks and Stratagems, and when the Iron Hand of Ju&s;tice had laid hold of them, and they were entangled in Difficul|ties, he often put &s;uch Quirks and Eva&s;ions in their Heads, and gave them &s;uch Ad|vice, as &s;ometimes prov'd of great Advantage to them, &s;o that he became a kind of Oracle among&s;t the Thieves.</P>
<P>After he had laid a con&s;iderable Time in the <HI>Compter,</HI> he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a Friendly Gen|tleman in <HI>Little-Britain,</HI> who getting a &s;mall Contribution among his Neighbours, procur'd <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Liberty with it.</P>
<P>He had now a numerous Acquaintance, with whom he con&s;tantly a&s;&s;ociated, the&s;e were the Thieves (as has been before ob&s;er|ved;) there was no Enterprize they went upon, whether in Town or Country, but they acquainted <HI>Jonathan</HI> with the Particulars of their Succe&s;s, what Booty they got, and what Hazzards they run, &s;o communicative are the&s;e Gentlemen to tho&s;e who keep them Company; yet, at the Beginning, he had &s;o much the Fear of the Gallows before his Eyes, that they cou'd never prevail with him to go with them upon any Adventure, and &s;hare in the executive Part.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="21">At fir&s;t, <HI>Jonathan</HI> drove but a poor ped|ling Trade, only helping People to Wri|tings which the Thieves cou'd make no Pro|fit of, and which cou'd be of no U&s;e but to the Owners, and in this he at fir&s;t acted with &s;uch extream Caution, for fear of coming within the Penalty of the Laws, that after he had bargain'd with the People, and they were come by his Appointment to pay the Money, and receive the Writings, he led them into a Room contriv'd for that Purpo&s;e; where pu&s;hing back a &s;mall Pannel of the Wain&s;cot, a Hand us'd to appear with the Writings in it, and the Parties were to take them out of that Hand, and to put the Money into it, without their &s;eeing the Body which belonged to it; &s;o that they cou'd not &s;ay he had ever taken any of their Money, or receiv'd the &s;tolen Goods; yet the Succe&s;s and Encouragement he after|wards met with, made him more carele&s;s to his great Sorrow.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing that gave him any Fame, was a Di&s;pute he had with <HI>Cornelius a Til|burgh,</HI> a noted Quack Doctor, who being robb'd of &s;ome Goods, and hearing of <HI>Jona|than Wild,</HI> apply'd to him for the Recovery of them; but after they had treated &s;ome Time they cou'd not agree about the Price; upon the whole, <HI>Tilburgh</HI> was vex'd he cou'd not have his Goods again, and thinking <HI>Jo|nathan</HI> had them, he arre&s;ts him in an
<PB N="16" REF="22">
Action of Trover; <HI>Jonathan</HI> gave bail to the Action, and &s;o a Suit of Law was com|menced, which was &s;o well defended on <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s &s;ide, that the Doctor was non-&s;uited, and Co&s;ts were given to <HI>Jonathan.</HI></P>
<P>This gave him a great Reputation, among his good Friends the Thieves, who thought <HI>Jonathan</HI> the be&s;t Factor or Agent they cou'd employ, &s;o that his Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o in|creas'd, that 'tis thought he got two or three hundred Pounds a Year by Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But it is no wonder he &s;hould thus by de|grees increa&s;e in Bu&s;ine&s;s and in Fame, for no Man grows great at once. Having now engro&s;s'd the whole Traffick of &s;tolen Goods to him&s;elf, he became as u&s;eful to the Thieves as they were to him; for now by his Credit they had a &s;afe way of making Money of every Thing that fell into their Hands, whereas before they run as great Hazzards, of being di&s;cover'd and brought to Ju&s;tice when they went about to di&s;po&s;e of their Goods, as they did in &s;tealing them.</P>
<P>But as the Thieves fir&s;t &s;et him up only as their Factor, he by degrees made him&s;elf their Ma&s;ter and their Tyrant; he divided the City and Suburbs into Wards or Di|vi&s;ions, and appointed the Per&s;ons who were to attend each Ward, and kept them &s;trictly to their Duty; he al&s;o called them to a very exact Accuont, and made them produce what they had got, and tho' it were Money he
<PB N="17" REF="23">
wou'd have his Dividend; and it was no le&s;s than Death to <HI>&s;ink</HI> upon him, as he term'd it; for there was &s;carce any Thing &s;tole which was worth having again but he heard of it, and knew who the Per&s;on mu&s;t be that took it, as well as tho&s;e who lo&s;t it. This is plain by what follows:</P>
<P>Some time &s;ince, the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> being at Ma&s;s, at the Chapel of his Excel|lency Count <HI>Staremberg</HI> in the <HI>Pall-Mall</HI>; her Grace in the Height of her Devotion had her Gold Watch &s;tolen from her Side, which was enter'd next Day in Mr. <HI>Wild</HI>'s Office, who a&s;&s;ur'd her Grace that the Bu&s;ine&s;s was perform'd by a regular Hand, and therefore he doubted not the Recovery of it. <HI>Fox,</HI> alias <HI>Vaux,</HI> a dextrous Fellow, having his Station about <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall,</HI> the Court of Re|que&s;ts, and at the Cathedral and Parochial Churches, <HI>Wild</HI> was a&s;&s;ur'd mu&s;t be the Man, tho' he intending to bite <HI>Jonathan</HI> of his &s;hare, denied it ob&s;tinately at fir&s;t; but Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> u&s;ing Menaces, and threat'ning, if he per&s;i&s;ted, to &s;end him to his triangular Home, he con|fe&s;s'd the Bill, and <HI>paid back</HI> (as the Thieves term it) the Watch to the Dutche&s;s, for twen|ty five Guineas.</P>
<P>However fond <HI>Jonathan</HI> appear'd to be of getting Money, he &s;hew'd a Genero&s;ity to his Friends, not common with People who prac|ti&s;e the Law, of which I could give number|le&s;s In&s;tances: Particularly, an Acquaintance of
<PB N="18" REF="24">
his who lived in the <HI>Mint,</HI> having lo&s;t a Gold Watch (for there were Gold Watches there &s;ometimes) he paid back the Watch without one farthing Expence; he return'd me a Pocket Book with &s;ome Notes of Va|lue, which I advertis'd in one of the Papers, gratis, but gave me this Caution <HI>to keep better Company</HI>: And one Mr. <HI>H&mdash;ll,</HI> then a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, told me that once going to a Country Fair, he met <HI>Jonathan</HI> upon the Road, who gave him a Watch-word, by u&s;ing which, he &s;aid, if he met any of the <HI>Prigs</HI> that were out in the&s;e Hundreds, he would pa&s;s &s;afe. Mr. <HI>Giles Taylor,</HI> a tall Attorney, lo&s;ing his Snuff Box, he could not prevail with <HI>Jonathan</HI> to trouble him&s;elf about &s;uch trivial Things as he called it, but Mr. <HI>Taylor</HI> telling him he valued the Box, and withal reminded him that he us'd to come with Briefs to his Ma&s;ter Coun&s;ellor <HI>Daniel,</HI> whom he had the Honour to &s;erve in the Quality of a Footman: <HI>O Sir,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Wild, I cry your Mercy, you have given me many a Six-pence, call in a Day or two and you &s;hall have your Box again</HI>; which was accordingly left for him at a Tavern in the <HI>Old-Bailey</HI> without a Fee.</P>
<P>The Wife of Mr. <HI>Chi&s;elden,</HI> a famous Sur|geon, having been robb'd of a Diamond Buckle at the <HI>Bath</HI>; Mr. <HI>Chi&s;elden,</HI> together with a creditable Shop-keeper, near the <HI>Old-Bayley,</HI> waited on Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> for his Advice;
<PB N="19" REF="25">
<HI>Wild</HI> being very drunk, receiv'd him with a great deal of Rudene&s;s not u&s;ual with him, but he &s;ignified the Cau&s;e of his Di&s;gu&s;t to him; for he told the Surgeon that he had di&s;&s;ected &s;everal hone&s;t Fellows that were his Friends and Acquaintance, and that he &s;hould be d&mdash;d before he &s;hould have his Buckle again, which he a&s;&s;ured him was di&s;&s;ected, and divided among&s;t the jolly Fellows, who had fairly ventured their Lives for it, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Mr. <HI>Chi&s;elden.</HI></P>
<P>I mention the&s;e In&s;tances, to &s;hew that <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Practice was fairer than &s;ome other Peoples, and that he was capable of more honourable and friendly Actions, than tho&s;e that made &s;o great a Noi&s;e of <HI>their Charity, their Genero&s;ity,</HI> &amp;c. It is certain, as the elegant Author of the <HI>Weekly Journal</HI> ob|&s;erves, <HI>Jonathan</HI> hated the&s;e Pretenders to his Art, and call'd them the Quacks of the Profe&s;&s;ion which every Science was pe&s;ter'd with.</P>
<P>One time an accident happen'd to a Gen|tlewoman at <HI>Hackney,</HI> who us'd to let Lodg|ings: A Lady, who came attended by a Foot|man and a Maid, took a Lodging in her Hou&s;e; the fir&s;t Day they had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, they broke open a Scrutore belonging to the Gentlewoman of the Hou&s;e, which was full of Chince and Mu&s;lin, and very dex|terou&s;ly carried off the whole Cargoe; it was a great Lo&s;s to the poor Woman, who
<PB N="20" REF="26">
lamenting with her Neighbours, they advis'd her to go to <HI>Jonathan Wild,</HI> and offer a Sum of Money to recover it; &s;he went ac|cordingly, and when &s;he gave him an Ac|count where &s;he lived, and what &s;he had lo&s;t, he call'd to his Book-keeper to &s;earch the Books, to know if any of their People had been lately out to take the Air at <HI>Hackney:</HI> The Fellow having examin'd, an&s;wered imme|diately that <HI>Wapping Moll</HI> had been there, and that <HI>Tawny Be&s;s</HI> was her Maid, and <HI>Harry Smart</HI> her Footman; <HI>Jonathan</HI> ap|pear'd in a Pa&s;&s;ion, and curs'd them &s;uffi|ciently, but appointed the Gentlewoman to come again in a little Time, when he pro|cured the Things upon her paying the Money agreed for.</P>
<P>Thus he made them all pay Contribution, whether they made U&s;e of him in di&s;po&s;|ing of the Things or no: And when the late Act was made, which gives a Pardon to one Felon for convicting another, he became ab|&s;olute over them all; for if any of them di&s;oblig'd him, or, as he call'd it, <HI>rebel'd,</HI> he took them up, and thereby got the Reward appointed by Act of Parliament for taking Highwaymen: On the contrary, when any of his own People were taken, which he had a Mind to &s;ave, then he endeavour'd to take &s;ome other; then his own Man by claiming the Benefit of the Act became an Evidence. When ever any interloping Tra|ders
<PB N="21" REF="27">
&s;tarted up in the Bu&s;ine&s;s, that is, Peo|ple who &s;et up for them&s;elves without pay|ing him any Contribution, or Homage, or holding any Corre&s;pondence with him, he did all he cou'd to take them; and if &s;uch were otherwi&s;e taken up upon Su&s;picion, or upon any Information, and Evidence was wanting to convict them, nothing was more common than for him to take up one of his own Fellows, who&s;e Life was always in his Power, and make him &s;wear him&s;elf in|to &s;ome of the Robberies, of which the others were &s;u&s;pected, whereby their Evidence might obtain &s;ome Credit with a Jury, and <HI>Jona|than</HI> was intitled to the Reward if he was the Per&s;on who took them.</P>
<P>And thus by taking &s;ome of his own Gang now and then, becau&s;e they had di&s;oblig'd him, and apprehending others becau&s;e they were not of his Gang, and hanging them in the manner before de&s;cribed, he was rec|koned a very u&s;eful Man, and was often call'd upon by the Court to look at the Pri|&s;oners, and give them Characters; which &s;eem'd to have great Weight at that time. And &s;ometimes, by ingenious Quirks, or by managing the Juries or Evidences, he has brought off &s;ome of his Favourites, who had been taken in the very Facts for which they were committed; as he did once by two Fel|lows, who having committed a Robbery on the Highway, and &s;everal Per&s;ons well mount|ed
<PB N="22" REF="28">
and arm'd happening to come by imme|diately, they were pur&s;ued and taken, with the Gentlemens Watches and Rings about them; and being forthwith carried before a Ju&s;tice of Peace, were committed to <HI>New|gate</HI>; within a Day or two of the Se&s;&s;ions, <HI>Jonathan,</HI> who&s;e Wit &s;eldom fail'd him at a Pinch, enquiring the Names of the Pro&s;e|cutors, went to them, and asking them if they had not been robb'd by &s;uch and &s;uch Fellows, now in <HI>Newgate?</HI> The Gentlemen an&s;wered they had. <HI>Jonathan</HI> pretending a great Spleen to tho&s;e Fellows, who he &s;aid were the greate&s;t Rogues in the whole World, and that he would have hang'd them long ago if he could have found them; and there|fore begg'd of the Gentlemen that he might a&s;&s;i&s;t them in managing the Pro&s;ecution, and he wou'd engage the Ra&s;cals &s;hou'd not e|&s;cape: The Gentlemen, very willing to have Part of the Trouble taken off their Hands, accepted his Offer, knowing Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> to be a Per&s;on very well skill'd in tho&s;e Affairs. Ac|cordingly, they appointed to meet at a Ta|vern in the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> on the Morning which was appointed for the Trial of the&s;e Highway|men: When they met, <HI>Jonathan</HI> told them there was a great Croud in the Court, and that they had better &s;tay there till the Trial &s;hou'd begin; which he &s;aid wou'd not be till about Three a Clock in the Afternoon. In the mean time a Dinner was be&s;poke, to be rea|dy
<PB N="23" REF="29">
at One; and <HI>Jonathan</HI> &s;ent a Man to wait in the Court, with orders to call them when the Trial came on. <HI>Jonathan</HI> made &s;uch good U&s;e of his Time, that whether by putting &s;omething into the Liquor, or by fair Drinking, is not known; but it is certain he made the Gentlemen very drunk, who pa&s;s'd away the Time till Evening without thinking of the Matter; at which Time one of them wondring that their Me&s;&s;enger had not call'd them, they &s;ent another to the Court, to know what was doing there; when they found the Court was broke up, and the two Highwaymen were di&s;charg'd, there having no Evidence appear'd again&s;t them.</P>
<P>In an Affair like this, <HI>Jonathan</HI> did not come off quite &s;o well, tho' the Bu&s;ine&s;s was managed with equal Succe&s;s; the Story is this, One <HI>Arnold Powell,</HI> a notorious Hou&s;ebreaker, was committed to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and a Pro&s;ecu|tion carrying on again&s;t him by one Mr. <HI>Ea&s;t|wick,</HI> a Gla&s;s-grinder, near <HI>Bridewell. Jo|nathan</HI> pays his Re&s;pects to the Pro&s;ecutor, and acquaints him how ready he &s;hould be to bring &s;uch a Villain to Ju&s;tice, and if he would leave the Matter to his handling, he &s;hould certainly <HI>&s;end him to &s;leep with the Fathers,</HI> for that was his Expre&s;&s;ion. Ac|cordingly Mr. <HI>Ea&s;twick</HI> commits the Ma|nagement of the Suit to him, and cho&s;e to be directed by him; who, he was &s;atisfied,
<PB N="24" REF="30">
had a better Under&s;tanding in tho&s;e Affairs than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Before the Se&s;&s;ions, <HI>Jonathan,</HI> tho' retain'd on the other Side of the Cau&s;e; vi&s;its Mr. <HI>Powell,</HI> tells him of the dangerous Circum|&s;tances he was in, and at the &s;ame Time en|quires into the Value of his per&s;onal E&s;tate; the Thief apprehended his meaning, and made him &s;en&s;ible that forty Pounds &s;hould not part them, (for it &s;eems this Fellow never came into <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Books) whereupon the Bargain was &s;truck, the Money paid down, and Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> left him with this Ble&s;&s;ing, <HI>Live and pro&s;per.</HI></P>
<P>When the Se&s;&s;ions came on, a Bill was found for Felony and Burglary again&s;t Mr. <HI>Powell,</HI> for breaking open, and robbing the Hou&s;e of the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Ea&s;twick</HI>; &s;o far Mr. <HI>Ea&s;twick</HI> &s;aw Matters were carried fair: When this was done, Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> de&s;ir'd the Pro&s;ecutor and his Witne&s;&s;es to go to his Hou&s;e in the <HI>Old-Bayley,</HI> that they might nor wait about in the <HI>Se&s;&s;ions hou&s;e-Yard,</HI> till the Tryal came on, which they readily agreed to; from thence <HI>Jonathan</HI> carried them to an Alehou&s;e at the Upper-end of the Street, quite out of the hearing of the Court, and there plies them with Liquors by one of his Agents; in the mean Time he gets <HI>Powell</HI> &s;et to the Bar, and the Witne&s;&s;es call'd over and over, time after time, but no Body appearing, nor any Account to be given why they did not, the Pri&s;oner was acquitted.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="31">When Mr. <HI>Ea&s;twick</HI> found how the Game had been play'd, he complains to the Re|corder of the Abu&s;e, who was very ready to do Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> all the Ju&s;tice in the World, and therefore commits him to <HI>Newgate,</HI> in order to be try'd at the en&s;uing Se&s;&s;ions for the Offence; and <HI>Powell,</HI> tho' acquitted then for want of Evidence, was detain'd in Cu&s;to|dy, and convicted the next Se&s;&s;ions, perhaps for another Fact, and executed; but hone&s;t <HI>Jonathan</HI> alighted upon his Legs like an ex|pert Tumbler, and came off unhurt.</P>
<P>However, this was by di&s;cerning Men look'd upon to be a kind of a Slur upon <HI>Jo|nathan</HI>'s Character; he found him&s;elf, that after this he had not that Credit with the Court upon the Tryal of any Criminal, as he us'd to have; and he took as odd a way to retrieve it as ever was thought of; for in order to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the good Graces of the <HI>R&mdash;r,</HI> he &s;ets one of his Gang to &s;teal the Velvet Seats out of his Coach, and then waited upon him with a Tender of his Service, to recover them without any Expence to his Honour; but Sir <HI>W&mdash;m</HI> de&s;pis'd his Offer, and generou&s;ly cho&s;e rather to &s;it down with the Lo&s;s, than to recover them, by giving Countenance to &s;uch &s;can|dalous Practices.</P>
<P>By all the before-mentioned Tricks and Ar|tifices, <HI>Jonathan</HI> pa&s;s'd for a Man of &s;o much Under&s;tanding and Intere&s;t, that the Thieves
<PB N="26" REF="32">
began to think he could hang or &s;ave whom he pleas'd; &s;o that all Malefactors, whether of his own Gang or not, after they were taken, u&s;ed to flatter them&s;elves that if they cou'd rai&s;e any Money for <HI>Jonathan,</HI> he wou'd bring them off; and even after they were condemned, they were of Opini|on that his extraordinary Intere&s;t might pro|cure them a Reprieve, or have the Sentence chang'd to Tran&s;portation.</P>
<P>It is certain that it was one of his Arts to make them believe &s;o; and he u&s;ed par|ticularly to affect an extraordinary Intimacy with certain Ju&s;tices of Peace; and as it is &s;aid he &s;ometimes drank with tho&s;e Gentle|men at Taverns, he u&s;ed to leave word at Home, that if any Body &s;hould enquire for him, he was gone to &s;uch a Tavern, to meet Ju&s;tice &s;uch-a-one. The U&s;e he made of in&s;inuating this Notion into their Heads was, that if any Information &s;hould be given to the&s;e Ju&s;tices, again&s;t any of his Friends, he &s;hould have timely Notice of it, from them or their Clerks, &s;o that the Party might get out of the way; which was a material Thing towards keeping his People always depending upon him.</P>
<P>The Reader will imagine, by what has been here related, that <HI>Jonathan</HI> mu&s;t be a Per&s;on of no uncommon Parts:&mdash;To go|vern a Commonwealth already fix'd and e|&s;tabli&s;h'd, is no more than what may be done
<PB N="27" REF="33">
by any common Capacity; but to form and e&s;tabli&s;h a Body of &s;uch lawle&s;s People into what we may call a Form of Government; to erect a Commonwealth like that of the Bees, in which there &s;hou'd be no Drone, in which every Member was oblig'd to go forth and labour, and to bring an Offering to him their King, of Part of the Product of their Cunning and Indu&s;try; to be able &s;o many Years to evade the Puni&s;hments ap|pointed by the Laws of all Nations, for &s;uch Per&s;ons as make no Difference betwixt <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum</HI>; and to live not only in a Tolera|tion, but even in a kind of Credit, among&s;t the People he was robbing every Day, and to e&s;cape the Plots and Con&s;piracies of his own treacherous Subjects&mdash;I &s;ay, to be able to manage all this, mu&s;t proceed from an admira|ble Wit and Cunning, and thorough Ob&s;erva|tion of the Humours and weak Sides of Men.</P>
<P>But to return to our Subject, we have taken Notice in what manner <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Revenues were rais'd and encreas'd; but as his Subjects were &s;o frequently taken off by untimely Ends, his Royalty wou'd by degrees have declin'd and &s;unk at la&s;t to little or nothing, if he had not by admirable Fore|&s;ight and Care provided future Thieves both for him&s;elf and the Gallows.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mint</HI> in <HI>Southwark</HI> was the Country where <HI>Jonathan</HI> u&s;ually went to rai&s;e Re|cruits when his Army began to grow thin
<PB N="28" REF="34">
and weak; there I &s;ay he con&s;tantly beat up for Voluntiers, and mo&s;t of his be&s;t Men came from thence.</P>
<P>He knew it was the Place where Trade&s;|men who had met with Misfortunes fir&s;t re|tir'd to, that it was the con&s;tant Retreat of all tho&s;e whom Idlene&s;s, or Extravagance had render'd obnoxious to the Law&mdash;He knew al&s;o that People under tho&s;e Circum|&s;tances commonly brought a little Money with them at their fir&s;t going over, which being &s;oon &s;pent, by rea&s;on of their being out of Bu&s;ine&s;s to get more, they mu&s;t of Con&s;equence be reduc'd to extream Nece&s;&s;ity, till which Time he did not judge them right|ly qualified for his Service.</P>
<P>As I was let into this Secret of his Pro|ceedings by a Story from his own Mouth, I &s;hall relate the Method and Way he went to work with the Gentlemen <HI>Minters.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He made him&s;elf acquainted with all the People who kept publick Hou&s;es, whether Taverns, Ale-hou&s;es, or the Vend|ers of the royal Liquor commonly call'd <HI>Gin</HI>; from the&s;e he learn'd from Time to Time what People were newly come over, and if he lik'd the De&s;cription of their Per&s;ons, and the Account of their Circum&s;tances, he took &s;ome Opportunity of getting into Com|pany with them; and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> being face|tious as well as frank and open in Con|ver&s;ation, made him&s;elf very agreeable to
<PB N="29" REF="35">
tho&s;e &s;ort of People, who are call'd <HI>merry Fel|lows</HI>; be&s;ides, <HI>Jonathan</HI> always pretended to compa&s;&s;ionate their Misfortunes, and to &s;hew his Genero&s;ity would treat them, and make them drunk, and &s;ometimes perhaps lend them &s;mall Matters in their extream Nece&s;&s;ities&mdash;So that he has &s;ometimes confe&s;s'd, that by half a Crown well di&s;pos'd, that is lent with a certain Manner of which he was Ma&s;ter; he has &s;ometimes got fifty, and &s;ometimes a hundred Pounds; which it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd was laying Money out to a very good Ad|vantage.</P>
<P>We &s;hall prove this by an Example&mdash;<HI>Jonathan</HI> came acquainted with <HI>A. B.</HI> a broken Chee&s;emonger, who had taken Re|fuge in the <HI>Mint</HI>; this poor Fellow, being charm'd with the Conver&s;ation of the inge|nious <HI>Jonathan,</HI> &s;pent the little Money he had &s;aved from the Ruin of his Trade, in keeping him Company; when all was gone, <HI>Jonathan</HI> now and then lent him &s;ome &s;mall Matter, and ob&s;erving him to be young, ac|tive, and a Fellow of Spirit, work'd upon him, and brought him into his Mea&s;ures, by repre&s;enting to him the mi&s;erable Pro&s;pect he had before him; telling him he de&s;erv'd to be damn'd if &s;uch a clever Fellow as he &s;hou'd want good Cloaths on his Back, or Money in his Pocket, and that all the World wou'd de&s;pi&s;e him; therefore, &s;ays he, take my Advice, and <HI>get Money</HI>&mdash;The Advice
<PB N="30" REF="36">
was good and &s;ea&s;onable; for there was no|thing in the World the poor Fellow wanted more: But how to do it was the Difficulty&mdash;therefore he beg'd his Friend <HI>Jonathan</HI> to give him &s;ome Advice in that important Af|fair; Z&mdash;ds, &s;ays <HI>Jonathan,</HI> I know a great many clever Fellows, who keep the be&s;t Com|pany in Town, and make very &s;mart Figures, and if they have not Six-pence in their Pockets now, they'll have Money enough before they go to Bed, that is, if there be any Money to be had betwixt this and <HI>Bath,</HI> or this and <HI>Tunbridge.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Chee&s;emonger began to appre|hend his Friend <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and in his Ne|ce&s;&s;ity and De&s;pair, &s;aid he wou'd do any thing; but he had neither Hor&s;e nor Arms, nor any means of purcha&s;ing them; but <HI>Jo|nathan,</HI> who did nothing by halves, directed him where good Hor&s;es were to be hired for the U&s;e of the Gentlemen of the Snaffle, and gave him as much Money as wou'd pay for the Hire, for he was too cunning to ap|pear in the Matter him&s;elf; he al&s;o directed him to go upon the <HI>Ep&s;om</HI> Road, telling him there were no Gentlemen out upon the &s;ame Lay that way&mdash;and thus our Chee&s;emon|ger was turn'd into a Gentleman, and equip'd like a Knight Errant in &s;earch of Adventures.</P>

<P>He was no &s;ooner alighted, but he found <HI>Jonathan,</HI> who waited to receive him, to whom he very frankly gave an Account of what he had done, and what he had got with all the Circum&s;tances, thinking he had behaved him&s;elf very hand&s;omly for a new Beginner; nay, <HI>Jonathan</HI> him&s;elf prais'd him, and for his Encouragement took from him but &s;even Guineas of the nine, leaving him two as a mark of his Favour.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome may be of Opinion, that this Dividend was a little unequal, and that he who ventur'd all &s;hou'd have had the greate&s;t Share of the Booty; but it mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd on the other Side, that now he was initiated, he was become the Subject, nay, the Slave of <HI>Jonathan,</HI> who had power of Life and Death over him; and that &s;o far from mur|muring at what he took from him, it was <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Opinion he &s;hould think him&s;elf oblig'd to him that he did not hang him.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="38">The Fellow continu'd every now and then to make Excur&s;ions, &s;ometimes on one Road, &s;ometimes on another, con&s;tantly doing Bu&s;i|ne&s;s by him&s;elf; and if we may believe <HI>Jo|nathan,</HI> he always left the Fellow &s;ome &s;mall Matter of what he got, whether it happen'd to be little or much, but this we mu&s;t take upon his Credit; but however that be, the Chee&s;emonger was &s;o di&s;contented, that he re&s;olv'd to de&s;ert, and &s;ee what he cou'd do for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Accordingly, &s;ome time after he di&s;ap|pear'd, nor cou'd <HI>Jonathan</HI> find him out by all the Inquiry and Search he cou'd make; <HI>Jonathan</HI> rail'd loudly at him, &s;aying, Thus am I &s;erv'd by a parcel of Ra&s;cals when I have put Bread into their Mouths, but I'll hang him if there was not another Rogue left in <HI>England.</HI>&mdash;While <HI>Jonathan</HI> was thus enrag'd again&s;t the De&s;erter, &s;ome Peo|ple who had been robb'd upon the <HI>Oxford</HI> Road, came to make Propo&s;als for the Re|covery of &s;ome Watches and Pocket Books which had been taken from them; <HI>Jona|than</HI> con&s;ulted his Books, (for it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, he was very exact in minuting down all his Orders) and found that no Gentlemen under his Command had been out upon the Road for a Fortnight before; wherefore he was very inqui&s;itive to know what &s;ort of Man the Per&s;on was who had committed tho&s;e Robberies; and according

to their De&s;cription, and by other Circum|&s;tances, he was pretty &s;ure it mu&s;t be the de&s;erting Chee&s;emonger.</P>
<P><HI>Jonathan</HI> therefore &s;et out towards <HI>Ox|ford</HI> well mounted, and well arm'd, intend|ing to renew his Acquaintance with his old Friend, who, according to &s;everal Reports, had met with good Luck upon that Road; he jog'd on ea&s;ily, vi&s;iting all the Villages which lay in the By-Roads, both on the Right and Left, going into every Inn, look|ing into the Stables to &s;ee the Hor&s;es, and drinking with all the O&s;tlers and Chamber|lains, and enquiring of them what Company was in each Hou&s;e, and what Company they lately had; which was his con&s;tant Method when he went in &s;earch of a De&s;erter.</P>
<P>He &s;pent a good deal of Time in this man|ner to no purpo&s;e, when moving on to|wards <HI>Oxford,</HI> he met a Coach which had been ju&s;t robb'd; the Coachman giving him warning to take care, and telling him the Place where they had been attack'd, was not above a quarter of a Mile off: Upon this, <HI>Jo|nathan</HI> enquires the Number of the People who had robb'd them; the Coachman told him it was done by a &s;ingle Man, and in de&s;crib|ing him, confirm'd <HI>Jonathan</HI> it mu&s;t be his Chee&s;emonger: Upon this A&s;&s;urance, <HI>Jona|than</HI> &s;ets Spurs to his Hor&s;e, and coming to the Spot which had ju&s;t before been the Scene of Action, he ha&s;tes, and takes a

The Man before hearing the Tread of a Hor&s;e, look'd back; but &s;eeing no more than one Man, he thought it had not the Appearance of a Pur&s;uit, and therefore he never mov'd a Step the fa&s;ter; and it was at &s;uch a Di&s;tance, that he did not know the &s;weet Fiz of <HI>Jonathan.

<P>This Body of Gentlemen were generally cho&s;en out of &s;uch as had been Footmen, who by waiting at Tables, and frequenting publick Places with their Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, knew &s;omething of the Addre&s;s and Di&s;cour&s;e u&s;ed among Gentlemen; and the better to qualify them to acquit them&s;elves hand&s;omly at Balls, <HI>Jonathan</HI> &s;ometimes paid a Dancingma&s;ter to teach them to dance; that is, after he lo&s;t his own Dancingma&s;ter, the celebrated Mr. <HI>Lun,</HI> who died in his own Profe&s;&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> dancing; being hang'd at <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> for a Robbery on the Highway; who he &s;ometimes &s;aid was a great Lo&s;s to the Corporation.</P>

<P>We own'd to <HI>Jonathan,</HI> that this Affair was well projected, and as well executed: Oh, &s;ays he, this is nothing to what has been done; for one of our People once &s;tole a Hou&s;e of &s;ix Rooms on a Floor, and an hundred and fifty Pounds a Year Rent.</P>
<P>As this appear'd to be a kind of Rhodo|montade, we de&s;ir'd Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> to let us know how that cou'd be done; and he being very communicative in his Temper, told us the
<PB N="48" REF="54">
Story: A Gentleman had fitted up a Hou&s;e in <HI>Queen's-Square,</HI> in a very hand&s;om Man|ner, expecting to let it to &s;ome foreign Mi|ni&s;ter, or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Per&s;on of Quality; which as &s;oon as 'twas ready, I equipt a Fellow, who had prov'd him&s;elf a Man fit for Bu&s;ine&s;s, in a plain neat Suit, gold-headed Cane, Snuff Box, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> a good Chariot, with two other Rogues for Footmen: This &s;uppos'd Gentle|man calls upon the Landlord, and offers to treat with him for the Hire of his Hou&s;e, which he &s;aid, if he lik'd his Terms, he would take a Lea&s;e of for twenty one Years; where|upon the Bargain was &s;truck, and in few Days the Lea&s;es were drawn, the Rent to be paid at half yearly Payments; and the Furni|ture was promis'd by the Squire to be brought in the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> following.</P>
<P>The Week after the Landlord calls at the Hou&s;e to &s;ee his new Tenant, in order to promote a more intimate Acquaintance, but finds no Body there but a &s;habby old Man, and not one piece of Furniture; but on the contrary, two or three of the Marble Chim|ney Pieces and Slabs taken down: He en|quires of the old Man the meaning of it, who told him his Ma&s;ter order'd it, for he did not like the Fa&s;hion of 'em, and was pleas'd to have them alter'd. The Landlord &s;wore and &s;torm'd like a Madman, bid him get out of the Hou&s;e, and vow'd neither he nor his Ma&s;ter &s;hould have any thing to do
<PB N="49" REF="55">
there; but at length was pacify'd upon his a&s;&s;uring him his Ma&s;ter de&s;ign'd nothing but what was honourable, and would make him all the Satisfaction he could de&s;ire; and that the next Day at Noon he would come him|&s;elf and direct what he would have done: Whereupon he went away, but not very well pleas'd you may be &s;ure; and returning the next Day as the Fellow had appointed, he meets &s;ome Men at the Door, carrying out two Chimney-Gla&s;&s;es, and &s;everal Pictures that had been, fix'd to the Pannels over the Chimney-Pieces, which he &s;top'd; but the Squire happening him&s;elf to be in the Hou&s;e, but without his Chariot or Footmen, re|quired to know by what Authority he &s;topt the Goods from going where he &s;ent them? <HI>Why Sir,</HI> &s;ays the Landlord, <HI>are they not my own? What, wou'd you pull my Hou&s;e down before my Face, and &s;end it G&mdash; knows where? why is not your own Furniture brought home as you appointed? Sir,</HI> &s;ays the Tenant, <HI>I have had two Children &s;ick of the Small-Pox, which hinder'd me from moving &s;o &s;oon as I expected, but to-morrow &s;ome of my Goods will be here. But what are you doing, replies</HI> the Landlord, <HI>with the&s;e that you &s;end away? Why,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I am for fitting up Things according to my own Fancy, and I don't matter the Expence of it; for as I al|ter the Chimney-Pieces to another Form, the Gla&s;&s;es mu&s;t be made to an&s;wer them, and</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="56">
<HI>the Frames of the Pictures I &s;hall have made wider, to &s;quare with the Gla&s;&s;es. When I fitted up this Hou&s;e,</HI> &s;ays the Landlord, <HI>I thought it might have &s;erv'd any Man of Quality in the Kingdom. That might be,</HI> &s;aid the Squire again, <HI>I'll have Things done agreeable to my own Humour, for all that: When your Rent's due I'll pay it; and when my Lea&s;e is expired, I &s;hall leave the Hou&s;e in as good Condition as I have found it.</HI></P>
<P>The Landlord finding it in vain to oppo&s;e him, and withal that he had promi&s;ed that &s;ome of his Goods would certainly be brought to the Hou&s;e the next Day; which he hoped would be &s;ome Security for what he might po&s;&s;ibly &s;uffer by the Alterations the Te|nant was making, he waited till then, and came again to the Hou&s;e; but was &s;till more provoked, to &s;ee that all the Furniture that was brought, con&s;i&s;ted of two old Chairs and a Table, not worth half a Crown; and they had in the mean time been &s;o expert in ma|king the Alterations, (as they call'd it) that they had took down a very fine new Stair|ca&s;e, and the Wain&s;cot of the be&s;t Room. Whereupon the Landlord, finding him&s;elf really trick'd, arre&s;ts the Tenant in an Action of 500 <HI>l.</HI> But I got my Gentleman bail'd, and order'd my Attorney to &s;ummon the Plaintiff before a Judge, to &s;hew Cau&s;e of Action; which he failing to do, was oblig'd to take common Bail: But this not an&s;wer|ing
<PB N="51" REF="57">
his Purpo&s;e, (for in reality the Defendant ow'd him nothing) the Landlord files a Bill in the <HI>Exchequer</HI>; upon which the Tenant prefers a cro&s;s Bill, obliging him to an&s;wer to &s;everal Points, particularly the Letting the Hou&s;e to him; which as he could not deny, the Landlord's Bill was di&s;mi&s;s'd with Co&s;ts of Suit; and the Suit at Common Law went again&s;t him al&s;o, by Default: And the Te|nant going to work again upon the Premi&s;|&s;es, the Landlord thought fit to make Over|tures of Agreement; <HI>viz.</HI> That upon a Sur|render of his Lea&s;e, and giving up the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e, in the Condition it was then in, he would pay all his Charges, and relea&s;e him from all Damages what&s;oever: Which, &s;ince there was no more to be got, by my Con&s;ent, the Terms were accepted of; and &s;o the Landlord, be&s;ides a Year and a half's Rent, &s;at down at 400 <HI>l.</HI> Lo&s;s. Which I &s;uppo&s;e will make him take a little more Care how he lets his Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>At one time the &s;tealing Shopkeepers Ac|count-Books was grown a con&s;iderable Branch of Trade; of which <HI>Jonathan</HI> gave us one In&s;tance, which is worth relating.</P>
<P>A Merchant, a con&s;iderable Dealer in Hops, in <HI>Thames-&s;treet,</HI> had his Books &s;tole; and applying to me, offer'd ten Guineas to have them re&s;tor'd: The <HI>Prigs,</HI> &s;ays he, were in my <HI>Ken,</HI> that <HI>nim'd</HI> 'em out of his <HI>Swag.</HI> To explain this Language, it means, that the
<PB N="52" REF="58">
Thieves were then in his Hou&s;e, that &s;tole them out of the Shop. But to go on with the Story in plain Terms; <HI>Jonathan</HI> went in|to the Room where they were, and made the Report; but they &s;itting in Council, with two or three others of the &s;ame Squadron, tho' not in that Detachment, declared that they thought the Books were really worth twenty, that is, to return to the Owners; which <HI>Jonathan</HI> notify'd to the Merchant: But in &s;hort, the Agreement was fifteen. But then aro&s;e a Di&s;pute about the Delivery; <HI>Jo|nathan</HI> propos'd that he &s;hould leave the Mo|ney behind him, and the Books be brought to his Hou&s;e; which he &s;crupling, <HI>Jonathan</HI> &s;aid to him, <HI>Sir, do you que&s;tion my Honour? I &s;corn to do an ill thing by any Man. No, Sir,</HI> an&s;wer'd he, <HI>by no means;</HI> and then rea|dily laid down the Money, and went his Way: And before he got home him&s;elf, the Books were at his Hou&s;e. Which &s;erves to &s;hew how far <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Honour was to be depended on.</P>
<P>Within three Weeks the &s;ame Gentleman came to <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Hou&s;e upon the very &s;ame Bu&s;ine&s;s, for his Shop-Books were gone a|gain; and he would fain have had five Gui|neas bated this time, becau&s;e of his having been a Cu&s;tomer before; but <HI>Jonathan</HI> &s;aid, 'twas nothing to him: <HI>If the Gentleman,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>will take five Shillings, I &s;hall agree to it.</HI> So, in &s;hort, he paid down his Money,
<PB N="53" REF="59">
like a fair Dealer, and was going home, as before; but <HI>Jonathan</HI> call'd him back, and ask'd him how; and in what part of his Shop, his Counting-hou&s;e was built? He told him 'twas next the Street, and the Door open'd within-&s;ide, behind the Counter. Why, &s;ays <HI>Jonathan,</HI> you are quite wrong, you'll never keep your Books, if that's the Ca&s;e: But I'll come to Morrow my &s;elf, and &s;ee it, and then I'll advi&s;e you what's proper to be done.</P>
<P>The next Day <HI>Jonathan</HI> comes to <HI>Thames-&s;treet</HI> (the Books having been &s;ent before) and meets with the Merchant at home; He takes a Survey of the whole Affair, and ad|vi&s;es the old Counting-hou&s;e to be pull'd down, and a new one to be erected at the farther End of the Shop, and to break out a Sky-light over head; this, he &s;aid, would be the only Contrivance to make all &s;afe: Which was done according to <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Mo|del; and yet hardly a Month happen'd before it was again attack'd with the like Succe&s;s, and co&s;t him the &s;ame Sum over again, to get it out of <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Purgatory. The Manner of the Adventure is as follows: A Gentleman well dre&s;s'd, watch'd his Oppor|tunity, and came into the Shop, and ask'd if Mr. &mdash; was at home? Whereupon he was told that he him&s;elf was the Per&s;on. Sir, &s;ays he, I have two or three Words to &s;peak with you in private; and &s;o walks him towards his Counting-hou&s;e: The Hop-mer|chant
<PB N="54" REF="60">
goes in fir&s;t, expecting the Gentleman wou'd have follow'd, in order to declare his Bu&s;ine&s;s to him there; but in&s;tead of that, he only reaches out his Hand to the Desk, upon which the abovementioned Books lay, and takes them away, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;huts to the Door, locks it upon the Hop-Dealer, and walks off very lei&s;urely.</P>
<P><HI>Jonathan</HI> about this time had one of his be&s;t Hands de&s;erted him, and yet the Fellow &s;till did Bu&s;ine&s;s, as Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> found by his Books and the Accounts that came in. <HI>Jona|than</HI>'s Clerk minuted down a Gold Watch, a pair of Diamond Ear-Rings, with &s;everal other Things of le&s;s value, which were <HI>made,</HI> that is, &s;tole in their Language, by this Fellow, and yet he had mi&s;s'd &s;everal Mu&s;ters; and <HI>Jo|nathan,</HI> nor any of his People, had heard one &s;yllable of him for above three Months, any otherwi&s;e than that &s;uch and &s;uch Things were <HI>&s;poke with,</HI> which he knew mu&s;t be by the Devil or this Ra&s;cal, he &s;aid, therefore 'twas time to take him off: Whereupon <HI>Jonathan</HI> was continually upon the hunt for him, but as he kept Company with no other of the Profe&s;&s;ion, it was a difficult Matter for his Ma&s;ter to get Intelligence of him without his grand Ma&s;ter's A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but whether the Devil did really put it into his Servant <HI>Jo|nathan</HI>'s Head, or what other way he found it out, I can't &s;ay; but true it is, that at length he got certain Information where he then lodg'd.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="61">Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> had my Lord Chief Ju&s;tice's War|rant in his Pocket, &s;o taking two or three Con&s;tables with him, about four in the Morning he be&s;et the Hou&s;e, which was in <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet,</HI> the Corner of &mdash; <HI>&s;treet,</HI> a Publick-Hou&s;e; <HI>Jonathan</HI> headed the Po&s;&s;e, with a Pi&s;tol in each Hand, and up Stairs he goes to his Room, tho' not &s;o &s;ilent|ly, but that he heard them upon the Stairs, and therefore he gets up, and puts on his Breeches, Shoes, and Stockings; by that time <HI>Jonathan</HI> had wrench'd open the Door (for it was lock'd within &s;ide) upon &s;ight of whom, he gave a &s;pring out of the Window, which was one Story high, and came down into a little Yard, from thence leap'd over a Wall into the Street, and ran cro&s;s the Way into a Linen-Draper's Hou&s;e, who&s;e Door hap|pen'd to &s;tand open. At that time the Ser|vants of the Hou&s;e were wa&s;hing below Stairs, to whom the Fellow begs for Protection; for that he was pur&s;u'd by Bailiffs, and if he &s;hould be taken, he mu&s;t be inevitably ruin'd and undone. The poor credulous Women pity'd the Man's Ca&s;e, and told him, he &s;hould &s;tay with them till the Blood-&s;ucking Villains were gone. To return to <HI>Jonathan</HI> and the Con&s;tables, as &s;oon as they &s;aw their Man fly out of the Window, you may be &s;ure they were not long behind him; but as much Ha&s;te as they made down Stairs, they &s;aw not the lea&s;t Shadow of him, neither in the Yard, or
<PB N="56" REF="62">
in the Street, which prodigiou&s;ly &s;urpriz'd them all: But <HI>Jonathan</HI> peer'd about, being &s;atisfy'd, his Motion from the Window was downwards, therefore he mu&s;t have taken Hou&s;e &s;omewhere; and, at la&s;t, &s;py'd this Li|nen-Draper's Door open; he goes over, ac|quaints the Gentleman with what had hap|pen'd, and a&s;&s;ures him, the Rogue could be no where but in his Hou&s;e: He &s;aid, he had &s;een no &s;uch Per&s;on, and that he had not been from the Shop above a Minute. <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Jonathan, that was the very time he &s;lipt in; give me leave to &s;earch for him.</HI> Which be|ing granted, he went into the Wa&s;h-hou&s;e, where, for a good while, they deny'd they &s;aw any &s;uch Per&s;on, till being informed he was no Debtor, but a Highwayman and Hou&s;e|breaker, they own'd the Matter, and told Mr. <HI>Wild,</HI> the Man he look'd for was in the Coal-hole under the Stairs; whereupon he takes a Candle, calls all his Myrmidons about him, and into the Coal-hole he goes, but no Highwayman was there; then he &s;earches round the Cellar, Kitchen, and in &s;hort, eve|ry Place where he thought a Man could be conceal'd, but no Body was to be &s;een. <HI>Jo|nathan</HI> own'd he never was &s;o foil'd in all the Cour&s;e of his Practice before; he came up and told the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e there was no Body there; the Wa&s;her-women were frightned out of their Wits, believing they had &s;een a Spirit, and all look'd very fooli&s;h
<PB N="57" REF="63">
upon one another, till the Linen-Draper gave them to know, that if any Man went down Stairs, he mu&s;t be there &s;till, for he was &s;ure no Body had come up from thence, he having &s;taid in Sight ever &s;ince, and then per&s;uaded <HI>Jonathan</HI> to go down again, and look into all the Wa&s;hing-Tubs, and &s;earch every Place over again; for there is, &s;ays he, no other Way to get out, but up the&s;e Stairs, and &s;o into the Street.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> was prevail'd upon at la&s;t, and he and the Con&s;tables, with his <HI>Guard de Corps,</HI> re-de&s;cended, and finding one of the Tubs &s;tanding Bottom upwards, they turn'd that up, as the Gentleman had put it into their Heads, and there they found poor <HI>Culprit. Jonathan</HI> had no Patience, but flew upon him like a Tyger. <HI>You treacherous Dog,</HI> &s;aid he, where are the Diamond Ear-Rings, and Gold-Watch you &s;tole at &s;uch a Place? G&mdash; d&mdash;n me, you Villain, you cheating Son of a Whore, I'll hang you, if there's never another Rogue in <HI>England,</HI> you vile Ra&s;cal.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t remark here, that tho' <HI>Jonathan</HI> in the main us'd to talk up the Gentlemen of his Game, to be generally bright clever Fellows; yet when he was angry with &s;ome of them, he would own <HI>there were Scoun|drels of the Profe&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this Bounce of <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s, the Pri&s;oner under&s;tood how to &s;often this <HI>Machiavel</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s Temper; and thereupon whi&s;|per'd
<PB N="58" REF="64">
him to go up to his Lodging, and look behind the Head of the Bed, which <HI>Jonathan</HI> did, telling the People of the Hou&s;e, he mu&s;t go up Stairs for the Fellow's Cloaths, which he brought down along with him, and in a Hole where the Thief directed him to, he found a gold Watch, two &s;ilver ones, Rings, and other Things of Value, which he put into his own Pocket, for any Body el&s;e would not have known what to have done with them; and the Pri&s;oner being carried before the Ju&s;tice, was committed on Su&s;picion of Felony, and the next Se&s;&s;ions no Body appearing again&s;t him, he was di&s;charged.</P>
<P>The Succe&s;s that <HI>Jonathan</HI> went on with in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, render'd him famous all over <HI>London</HI>; and he made u&s;e of &s;everal little Arts to make him&s;elf appear con&s;iderable to di&s;tant Parts of the Kingdom, particularly by &s;ome Printers of News-Papers, and Dying-Speeches, whom he prevail'd on to give him a Character therein, in which he was generally &s;tiled THIEF-CATCHER-GENERAL OF GREAT-BRITAIN. His Hou&s;e was hand&s;om|ly furni&s;h'd, and &s;et out with Plate, Pictures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and when his Wife appear'd abroad, it was ge|nerally with a Footman in a fine lac'd Livery. He kept a Country-Hou&s;e, dre&s;s'd well, and in Company affected an Air of Grandeur. A little before his Cata&s;trophe he promis'd me a Haunch or a Side of Veni&s;on whenever I plea&s;ed to &s;end to him, &s;aying, he had two
<PB N="59" REF="65">
Parks at his Command, well &s;tock'd with Deer.</P>
<P>The Wealth that he was &s;uppos'd to have ama&s;s'd by this Bu&s;ine&s;s, made &s;everal Per&s;ons look upon him with Envy; and &s;ome well enough acquainted in the Rogui&s;h Arts, at|tempted to &s;et up again&s;t him a few Years ago; the Principal were, one <HI>Felt&mdash;n,</HI> a &s;u|perannuated Thief, <HI>Riddle&s;d&mdash;n</HI> an Attorney and Thief, who&s;e chief Merit for the Support of his Preten&s;ions to this Practice, was, his having &s;acrilegiou&s;ly and feloniou&s;ly broke open the Royal-Chapel at <HI>White-hall,</HI> and &s;tole thence the Communion-Plate, and Mr. <HI>H&mdash;n,</HI> City Mar&mdash;l. This la&s;t, and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> wrote Pamphlets again&s;t each o|ther, as it was the Cu&s;tom then between great Men; but <HI>Jonathan</HI> laying him&s;elf too open, <HI>H&mdash;n</HI> dropt the Pen, and took up the Cudgels of the Law, with which he bang'd <HI>Jonathan,</HI> &s;o that he thought fit to buy his Peace at the Price of a Sum of Money.</P>
<P>However, none of them all was able to give <HI>Jonathan</HI> any notable Di&s;turbance in his Office; on the contrary, he found Means &s;oon after to get <HI>Riddle&mdash;n</HI> tran&s;ported for not complying with the Conditions of his Pardon, to make <HI>Felt&mdash;n</HI> run mad, and <HI>H&mdash;n</HI> entirely to quit his Preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>Wherefore he turn'd him&s;elf again to his Bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;And, as we were enumerating how
<PB N="60" REF="66">
many Species of Thieves he had under his Command, we &s;hall re&s;ume that Part of our Story.</P>
<P>There were another Sort of Gentry under his Command, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it was to loiter about the Streets in the Day-time; and as Servants, who go of &s;hort Errands to a Chand|ler's Shop, or Baker's, are apt to leave the Door a jar, (as they call it) they were to whip in, and &s;eize upon the next Thing that was portable, and bring it off. They generally peep'd in, to &s;ee that no Body was in the Fore-Parlours, and if by Chance any Body &s;hould &s;urprize them, they were ready to en|quire if &s;ome Per&s;on with a &s;trange Name did not live there; tho' it &s;eldom falls out &s;o, becau&s;e they generally do their Bu&s;ine&s;s in a Minute.</P>
<P>The&s;e Sort of People &s;ometimes go in Li|veries, and &s;ometimes dre&s;s'd like Ticket Porters with Silver Badges either upon their Coats, or about their Necks; one of them &s;ome Time &s;ince whipp'd into a Hou&s;e in <HI>King-Street,</HI> near <HI>Long-Acre,</HI> which is di|vided into Tenements, the People furni&s;hing their own Lodgings, and going directly up two pair of Stairs, from whence he &s;aw a Woman, who inhabited it, come down; he ea&s;ily put back the Lock, and finding nothing in the Room of any Value, except the Bed|ding, he tied it all up, and was carrying it off, when the Owner happen'd to meet him at
<PB N="61" REF="67">
the lower End of the Stairs, and asking him where he was carrying that Bedding? He an|&s;wer'd, without He&s;itation, that he brought it from Mr. &mdash; the Uphol&s;terer, and was car|rying it to &s;uch a one, but I find they don't live here. Oh! &s;ays the Woman, they live at next Door; thank you, Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ays the Fellow; and before &s;he got up Stairs, to find it was her own Bedding, he had got into a Hackney Coach, and carried it &s;afe off.</P>
<P>The&s;e People &s;ometimes went di&s;guis'd like Chairmen in great Coats and Harne&s;s, and a couple of them meeting together, &s;tole the young Dutche&s;s of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Chair, as her Grace was vi&s;iting at Mrs. <HI>H&mdash;n</HI>'s in <HI>Piccadilly,</HI> her Chairmen and Footmen being gone to a neighbouring Ale-Hou&s;e; one of her Servants thought immediately of apply|ing to Mr. <HI>Wild,</HI> who told him, that if he wou'd leave ten Guineas, he might have the Chair the next Day; the Man made &s;ome Difficulty of leaving the Money before-hand, but Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> told him he was a Man of Honour, and &s;corn'd to wrong him, and in|deed his Character was by this Time e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd as a Man that dealt honourably in his Way; &s;o that the Man ventur'd at la&s;t to leave the Money; wherefore Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> bid him direct the Dutche&s;s's Chairmen to at|tend the Morning Prayers at <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s-<HI>Inn-Chapel,</HI> and there they &s;hou'd find the Chair; which the Fellows did accordingly, and they
<PB N="62" REF="68">
found the Chair, with the Crim&s;on Velvet Cu&s;hions and Damask Curtains all &s;afe, and unhurt.</P>
<P>And it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that whenever <HI>Jonathan</HI> oblig'd the Parties to leave the Money before-hand, he very punctually com|ply'd with the Terms of Agreement, as to the Delivery of the Goods; for one of his com|mon Sayings was, <HI>that Hone&s;ty was the be&s;t Policy.</HI></P>
<P>He frequently drew out Detachments of &s;ome of his clevere&s;t Fellows, whom he &s;ent out upon Command to Country Fairs; upon which Occa&s;ion he generally march'd out him&s;elf, for indeed the Service could not be well carried on without him; for the common People &s;eeing <HI>Jonathan</HI> there, were the more carele&s;s; becau&s;e he always gave out, that he came to take &s;ome Rogues whom he &s;u&s;pected to be there, and the People had a Notion that his Pre&s;ence frightned away the Thieves; and to countenance this Belief, he went doubly and trebly arm'd, and often wore Armour under his Cloaths, which he took care to &s;hew in all Companies; being attended by three or four, and &s;ometimes half a Dozen terrible looking Fellows by way of <HI>Garde du Corps,</HI> as if all Thieves in <HI>England</HI> had vow'd to &s;acrifice him.</P>
<P>This Grimace took very well, for it gave him an Opportunity of protecting and carry|ing off the Booty which was made in the&s;e

Fairs; and if any of his Party was in Danger of being taken, the&s;e Myrmidons of his, who pa&s;s'd for his Body Guard, were to run into the Crowd, and under pretence of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the People, who were about to &s;eize &s;uch Rogues, were to try to &s;huffle off, and favour their E&s;cape.</P>
<P>In fine, his Bu&s;ine&s;s in all Things was to put a fal&s;e Glo&s;s upon Things; and to make <HI>Fools</HI> of Mankind (which was his own Ex|pre&s;&s;ion;) yet, when he had a Mind to be merry, to drink his Bottle, and to laugh at the World, he talk'd with too much Free|dom of him&s;elf, and his own Management, and not without &s;ome Vanity; of which there are a thou&s;and In&s;tances: We &s;hall give one, becau&s;e it is &s;hort&mdash;A certain Trade&s;man, a very hone&s;t Man, tho' of <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s Ac|quaintance, going into a Tavern, where he expected to meet &s;ome Company, by Mi&s;take went in where <HI>Jonathan</HI> was drinking with &s;ome merry Fellows; the Trade&s;man was about to draw back, but <HI>Jonathan</HI> pre&s;s'd him to &s;it down and take a Gla&s;s with them; the Trade&s;man was a little angry with <HI>Jona|than</HI> for the following Rea&s;on; about a Week before pa&s;&s;ing thro' a Country Fair, he &s;aw <HI>Jonathan</HI> a Hor&s;eback, and asking him how he did, <HI>Jonathan</HI> damn'd him, and bid him not trouble him with impertinent Que&s;tions; therefore, the Trade&s;man de&s;ir'd to know the Rea&s;on why <HI>Jonathan</HI> &s;napp'd him up in that
<PB N="64" REF="70">
rude angry Manner, when he had &s;poke to him &s;o civilly? Z&mdash;ds, &s;ays <HI>Jonathan,</HI> you di&s;turb'd me in my Bu&s;ine&s;s, for <HI>I had at that Time twenty Pair of Hands at Work.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed, he employ'd Hands in all &s;orts of Works; &s;o that according to the Author of the <HI>Fable of the Bees,</HI> he was a great Be|nefactor to Trade; for as &s;ome of our News Papers have ob&s;erv'd, he kept in Pay many Arti&s;ts for the altering of Watches and Rings; &s;o he al&s;o kept a kind of Magazine, or Armory, of all kind of In&s;truments us'd in <HI>Thievery,</HI> as Picklocks, Files, Saws, and Engines for forcing Doors, Windows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which he made no Secret of &s;hewing, pre|tending he found them upon &s;uch and &s;uch Hou&s;e-breakers whom he had taken and con|victed, tho' it is certain he did not &s;uffer them to grow ru&s;ty for want of U&s;e; for he never went into a Hou&s;e, but like an Engineer, he wou'd view on which &s;ide it might be at|tack'd with the mo&s;t Advantage, and he knew better Things, than to &s;end his Men upon Actions without Arms.</P>
<P>Sometimes <HI>Jonathan</HI> &s;poke in the Stile of a Prince; as when the Son of Mrs. <HI>Knap,</HI> who was murther'd by a Footpad, near <HI>Gray's-Inn-Wall,</HI> went to him, to de&s;ire his A&s;|&s;i&s;tance in taking the Murderer, and putting ten Guineas in his Hand for his Encourge|ment, with a Promi&s;e of forty more when the Work &s;hou'd be done; <HI>Jonathan</HI> an&s;wer'd

him gravely, he might depend he wou'd pro|duce the Villian; <HI>for,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I never pardon Murther</HI>&mdash;and indeed he was as good as his Word, for he &s;eized the Fellow at the <HI>Jerua&s;alem Tavern</HI> in <HI>Clerkenwell,</HI> and he was hang'd the Se&s;&s;ions following.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he went on with this Tide of Suc|ce&s;s, and &s;eem'd to carry the World before him, an ill Wind aro&s;e, which blew from a certain Corner of the Law, and which &s;eem'd to threaten the Overthrow of his Common|wealth&mdash;For Sir <HI>W&mdash;m T&mdash;&s;on</HI> ob&s;erv|ing what Mi&s;chiefs aro&s;e from the Practice of receiving &s;tolen Goods, and returning them again to the Proprietors for &s;uch Sums of Money as the Receiver and Proprietor agreed upon, which Money no doubt mu&s;t be divided betwixt the Receiver and Thief; thought of putting an end to it, by bring|ing a Bill into the Hou&s;e of Commons, for the <HI>more effectual tran&s;porting of Felons, and for preventing Burglaries and Felons,</HI> in which among other Things was the follow|ing Clau&s;e.</P>

<P>We are well inform'd, that after this Act had pa&s;s'd the R&mdash;r was pleas'd to &s;end for <HI>Wild</HI> to admoni&s;h him, and let him know the Danger and Hazard of pur&s;uing the &s;ame Cour&s;e of Life any longer, and recommend|ed to him to detect Rogues and bring them to Ju&s;tice; promi&s;ing upon that Condition, to give him all Encouragement, reminding him of what con&s;iderable Sums he had got that Way already, by which he might judge that he might get &s;ufficient to keep him by doing good Service to the Publick, and living hone&s;tly.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="73">Whether the&s;e good Admonitions, or the Fear of this new Law, wrought upon his Con&s;cience, is uncertain; but there was a &s;udden Damp put upon all his Bu&s;ine&s;s, his <HI>Books were &s;hut up</HI> for &s;ome Weeks, and he grew &s;o ab&s;temious, that he refu&s;ed &s;everal Sums offer'd him for the Recovery of things &s;tolen&mdash;Yet, he did not break off all Ac|quaintance and Corre&s;pondence with his old Friends and Allies, the Thieves; on the con|trary, having the Command of &s;ome Money he gave them &s;ome &s;mall Matters (ju&s;t what he pleas'd) for what <HI>Old Nick</HI> had &s;ent them in their Way, and depo&s;ited the Goods up in a Wareheou&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mean time, all <HI>Wild</HI>'s Acquain|tance were inqui&s;itive to know what he in|tended to turn him&s;elf to; for they took it, for granted, that this new Act had quite cut him out of his former Bu&s;ine&s;s; having a Notion that he was too cunning ever to venture him&s;elf within the Clutches of the Law.&mdash;Wherefore he talk'd of a new Project; which was, for &s;etting up a Policy, and opening an Office for taking in Sub|&s;criptions for in&s;uring again&s;t Robbery; pre|tending to &s;ettle a &s;ufficient Fund, and give good Security for the Performance of Arti|cles; &s;ometimes &s;hewing a manu&s;cript Paper of Propo&s;als, and con&s;ulting People whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to have any Under&s;tanding in tho&s;e Affairs, extolling the great U&s;e and
<PB N="68" REF="74">
Advantage this Project wou'd be to the Pub|lick; not doubting, he &s;aid, but that all Trading People, as well as Gentlemen and Noblemen, who kept great Quantities of Plate in their Hou&s;es, wou'd for their own &s;akes encourage &s;o u&s;eful an Undertaking; bragging that it was no <HI>South-Sea-Bubble,</HI> and that he could fairly make a great For|tune by it.</P>
<P>Whether he gave out this Report only to amu&s;e People, and to hinder them from en|quiring any farther into his Affairs; or whe|ther he was in earne&s;t, and thought to bring it to bear, I can't tell; but the Thing was generally receiv'd as a Banter, or as a Piece of Mr. <HI>Wild</HI>'s Wit, and no farther Steps were taken in it.</P>
<P>It was about this time, that he projected the carrying on a Trade to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flan|ders</HI>; and thereupon purchas'd a Sloop, and put in one <HI>Roger J&mdash;&s;on</HI> to command her, who had long been one of <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s clever Fellows. He carry'd over Gold Watches, Rings, Plate, and now and then a Bank or Gold&s;mith's Note, that had been <HI>&s;poke with</HI> by the way of the Mail. His chief Trading Port was <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> where he is particularly well known; from thence he u&s;ually tra|vell'd up to <HI>Bruges, Ghent, Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and o|ther great Towns, where he brought his Toys and Jewels to Market, and then re|turn'd to his Sloops took in a Lading of Hol|lands,
<PB N="69" REF="75">
and other Goods, and came back to the River of <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>It is not to be expected that <HI>Jonathan</HI> and <HI>Roger</HI> would let any one &s;hare in the Pro|fits of &s;uch an honourable Profe&s;&s;ion: It would have been incon&s;i&s;tent with their Pra|ctice, who never paid for any thing, to pay Cu&s;tom; that would have been reflected up|on as idle and fooli&s;h: No, the Cargoe came generally &s;afe to Land the fir&s;t Night; and at a certain Hou&s;e within forty Miles of <HI>Newington-Buts,</HI> mo&s;t Part of the dark Bu&s;i|ne&s;s was acted; where Councils were &s;ecret|ly held, and the Projects form'd. But I hope from what has happen'd, &s;ome Per&s;ons who are well known, will have Prudence to take Warning, &s;ince I can a&s;&s;ure them that their Actions are &s;ifting into by Per&s;ons of no &s;mall Penetration, and whom they are not entire Strangers to.</P>
<P>But to return from this Digre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Roger</HI> drove on the Bu&s;ine&s;s above-mentioned but two Years, which was owing to an Accident that he him&s;elf was the Occa&s;ion of: It happen'd, that by &s;ome Negligence or other, two Pieces of <HI>Holland</HI> were lo&s;t in the &s;hip|ping them for <HI>England,</HI> which, when he ar|riv'd, he &s;topp'd out of his Mate's Wages, making him pay for the whole Lo&s;s. This &s;o provok'd the Mate, that he went imme|diately and gave Information of <HI>Jon&mdash;n</HI>'s running &s;uch Quantities of Goods. Where|upon
<PB N="70" REF="76">
the Ve&s;&s;el was exchequer'd in the Ri|ver, and he was oblig'd to &s;tand a Trial with the King, in which he was ca&s;t in 700 <HI>l.</HI> Da|mages; and &s;o his Trade was put an End to in that particular Way.</P>
<P>This Stop brought <HI>Jonathan</HI> again to Con|&s;ideration; he &s;oon mi&s;s'd his Returns from <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> and having three Wives living, and always a Seraglio of Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, no le&s;s than half a dozen at a time, to maintain, accord|ing to his Rank; and being frequently im|portun'd and teaz'd by People who had been robb'd, to help them to their Goods, he ven|tur'd to dabble a little again; but with great Caution, and for none but &s;uch as he took to be Men of Honour; every now and then bringing in an Offering to the Gallows of &s;ome idle Ra&s;cal who did not mind his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and who, according to his Notions, was fit for nothing but hanging.</P>
<P>Finding no bad Con&s;equence to proceed from his new Practice, it made him bolder and bolder, &s;o that he began to think he might go on as before, and that he &s;hould be connived at; in a &s;mall time carrying on his Trade with very little Caution, he went publickly down to the late In&s;tal|ment at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> accompanied by his Lady Madam <HI>Wild,</HI> attended by a couple of Foot|men in laced Liveries; and the Detachment, he commanded down upon that Occa&s;ion,
<PB N="71" REF="77">
made as good a Figure, both for Dre&s;s and Equipage, as any People there.</P>
<P>As there was a very great Booty brought off &s;afe from that Expedition, Mr. <HI>Wild</HI> had more than ordinary Court made to him by People of Fa&s;hion of both Sexes, who &s;olli|cited hard to have their Jewels, Watches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> return'd upon a rea&s;onable Compo&s;ition; and his open Way of treating upon this Occa&s;ion was the mo&s;t impudent thing he ever did in Contempt of the late Act&mdash;He proceeded fo far as to break off with &s;everal People, be|cau&s;e they wou'd not come up to his Terms; and he con&s;iderably advanced the Price of &s;tolen Goods; for whereas at fir&s;t he took no more for any thing of Plate than its Value in Weight, now he wou'd make People pay &s;omething for the Fa&s;hion al&s;o, otherwi&s;e they &s;hould never have them; intending to &s;end them over to <HI>Holland,</HI> where they might come to a better Market.&mdash;</P>
<P>Yet no Pro&s;ecution follow'd all the&s;e da|ring Proceedings; which made him think, no doubt, that he could do any thing; yet he had not long ago a narrow E&s;cape, as we &s;hall &s;hew by the following Relation.</P>
<P><HI>Jonathan,</HI> &s;itting one Day at an Inn in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> ob&s;erv'd a large Trunk in the Yard, and imagining there might be &s;ome Things of Value therein, he immediately went home, and order'd one <HI>Rann,</HI> a noto|rious
<PB N="72" REF="78">
Acquaintance, to habit him&s;elf like a Porter, and to endeavour to <HI>&s;peak with it: Rann</HI> obeys his Ma&s;ter's Commands, and accordingly &s;ucceeds. The Trunk belong'd to Mr. <HI>Jarvis,</HI> a Whip-maker in that Neigh|bourhood, who was &s;ending it down to a Dealer in the Country. There was in it a great Quantity of rich Linen, and other Things for a Wedding. Upon Mr. <HI>Jarvis</HI>'s applying to <HI>Wild,</HI> after many Delays, he had mo&s;t of the Goods again for ten Guineas. But &s;oon after <HI>Wild</HI> and <HI>Rann</HI> falling out, he got him hang'd. And the Day before his Execution, he &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Jarvis,</HI> and re|lated to him the above Particulars: But Mr. <HI>Jarvis</HI> dying &s;oon after, <HI>Jonathan</HI> had the good Luck to hear no more of the Matter.</P>
<P>But now it being decreed by Providence, that <HI>Jonathan</HI> &s;hould reign no longer, he was infatuated to do a Thing which brought on his De&s;truction&mdash;Certain Per&s;ons hav|ing Information where a con&s;iderable Quan|ty of rich Goods lay, &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;tolen, obtain'd a Warrant for the Sei&s;ure of them; which was accordingly done: Tho' <HI>Jonathan</HI> did not go and claim the Goods as his own, he had the A&s;&s;urance to take out an Action, in the Name of <HI>Roger John&s;ton,</HI> to whom he pretended the Goods belong'd, and ar|re&s;ted the Per&s;on or Per&s;ons who &s;eiz'd them. Thus he pretended to recover tho&s;e Goods by Law, for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing which (if they
<PB N="73" REF="79">
were found upon him) the Law would hang him&mdash;</P>
<P>A Proceeding &s;o bare-faced and impudent, put certain Per&s;ons upon finding out Means of bringing &s;o &s;turdy a Rogue to Ju&s;tice; <HI>Jonathan</HI> was threaten'd loud, which occa|&s;ion'd a Report all over the Town, that he was fled from Ju&s;tice; upon which Occa&s;ion, he publi&s;h'd a bullying Adverti&s;ement in &s;ome of the News Papers, offering a Re|ward of ten Guineas to any Per&s;on who &s;hou'd di&s;cover the Author of &s;uch a &s;canda|lous Report; at the &s;ame Time he run into all publick Places to &s;hew him&s;elf, and let the World &s;ee that he was not run away as was reported&mdash;Yet, in the mid&s;t of all this blu&s;tering he was &s;eized and committed to <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>There are &s;ome other Circum&s;tances in this Story, but as we had it only from his own Mouth, that he was malicious again&s;t the Per&s;ons concerned, and endeavour'd to a&s;per&s;e them, we &s;hall &s;ay no more of it.</P>
<P>How far <HI>Roger John&mdash;n</HI> was concern'd with <HI>Wild</HI> at the Time of his Apprehen&s;ion, I leave the World to judge, when immedi|ately upon his being committed to <HI>Newgate,</HI> an Expre&s;s was &s;ent over, and <HI>John&mdash;n,</HI> with another of the Trade, came down to <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> and appear'd like Per&s;ons of Quality, told the News to all about him, and &s;wore he'd hang both <HI>Jonathan</HI> and the B&mdash; who
<PB N="74" REF="80">
calls her &s;elf his Wife; &s;o he takes a Packet and hires her for <HI>Dover,</HI> where he arriv'd: But as he has hot appear'd publickly in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> we may very well &s;uppo&s;e that the hang|ing of them was the lea&s;t Part of his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>We can't forbear ob&s;erving &s;omething re|markable in the Fate of this Fellow; fir&s;t, that he had Opportunities of e&s;caping after he knew that a Pro&s;ecution was de&s;ign'd again&s;t him; and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that the Fact for which he died, was committed whil&s;t he was a Pri&s;oner in <HI>Newgate</HI>; for he was &s;o blind, as to imagine, that the taking but ten Gui|neas for the Recovery of the Lace, when the Woman offered fifteen or twenty, and refu&s;ing to accept of any Thing for his own Trouble, and al&s;o that palliating Speech he made her, that he did the&s;e Things only <HI>to &s;erve poor People who had been wronged,</HI> wou'd have been Circum&s;tances in his Fa|vour when he &s;hould come to be tried; not con&s;idering that he directly by this Action incurr'd the Penalty of the Act of Parliament before quoted; which is a Proof that all his former Cunning and Sagacity for&s;ook him, when he wanted it mo&s;t, and makes good that Saying&mdash;<HI>Quem Jupiter vult perdere, dementat prius</HI>&mdash;Jupiter fir&s;t takes away the Under&s;tanding of him whom he has a Mind to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>I believe no Malefactor ever &s;tood his Ground &s;o long, committing every Day acts
<PB N="75" REF="81">
of Felony in Sight of the World; &s;o that I've heard him compute, that in fifteen Years he had receiv'd near ten thou&s;and Pounds for his Dividend of &s;toln Goods return'd, living all this while in Riot and Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>But Vengeance at length overtook him, and from the Minute of his being &s;eized, his Sen&s;e and Re&s;olution fail'd; nor was he &s;pi|rited up by the Hopes of a Reprieve, which &s;ome People endeavoured to flatter him with, and indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread &s;uch a Rumour about, whil&s;t they were trembling, le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;o; becau&s;e, he and they are &s;uppos'd to be no Strangers to each others Practices.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not trouble the Readers with any Thing which has already been made Pub|lick, concerning this extraordinary Fellow, who has made &s;o much Noi&s;e in the World; therefore we &s;hall conclude, with ob&s;erving that whoever had &s;een him in the Gaiety of his Life, when all his Rogueries were &s;uc|ce&s;sful; and had al&s;o been Witne&s;s of his deplorable State of Mind after his Condem|nation, might have drawn a Le&s;&s;on of Mora|lity from it, which perhaps might have been of U&s;e to an Athei&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, to have &s;een one remarkable for the Gaiety of his Temper, for a va&s;t Depth of Cunning, as well as Hardne&s;s and per&s;onal Courage, &s;o chang'd at the Apprehen&s;ions of his approaching Death, and the great Ac|count which is to follow; to have &s;een him
<PB N="76" REF="82">
under the greate&s;t Di&s;tractions and Horrors of Mind, that human Nature is capable of &s;uf|fering, wou'd be convinc'd, that <HI>Virtue only can give true Tranquillity, and nothing can &s;upport a Man again&s;t the Terrors of Death, but a good Con&s;cience.</HI></P>

<P>IT having plea&s;ed Almighty God in his Ju|&s;tice, to put an End to a mo&s;t vicious and wicked Cour&s;e of Life, by a &s;hameful and ignominious Death; the World will expect &s;ome Account of my real Sentiments, and Be|haviour under &s;o great a Vici&s;&s;itude.</P>
<P>Such as expect any extraordinary Di&s;cove|ries and Confe&s;&s;ions from me, will be di&s;ap|pointed; for my Affairs are too much confu|&s;ed, and my Mind too &s;adly perplexed to give
<PB N="77" REF="83">
me Room to &s;atisfie the Curious in a particu|lar Manner; neither do I believe it would be of any publick Advantage, except to &s;ome few Printers and Publi&s;hers.</P>
<P>Let it &s;uffice, that I have gone on in a long Series of dreadful Guilt, and no Crime (Trea|&s;on, Murder, and Sodomy excepted) e&s;caped me; for which God's Vengeance has now over|taken me. My ra&s;h Zeal to &s;erve Mr. <HI>John|&s;on,</HI> by directing an Action to be brought for the Recovery of his Effects, has facilitated my Fate, and utterly undone me, by putting me into the Hands and Power of my Enemies. That I had previous Notice of their De&s;igns, and of Warrants being i&s;&s;ued again&s;t me, is too no|torious to be conte&s;ted; and I might have e&s;ca|ped far enough out of their Reach many Times, if I had thought my &s;elf in any Dan|ger; but I am equally &s;urprized with the re&s;t of the World, who never thought Matters could have been carried to this Height a|gain&s;t me.</P>
<P>The Methods I took for to procure a Re&s;pite, and protract the Time of my Execution, were no other than what is natural enough to poor Wretches under the dreadful Sentence of Death, and what has been often practi&s;ed by Malefactors of much greater Rank and Qua|lity than my &s;elf. I mean my pretending to di&s;cover the Per&s;ons that robb'd the Exche|quer; but the Government was wi&s;er, and
<PB N="78" REF="84">
knew better Things than to be impo&s;ed on by &s;o mean and de&s;picable a Criminal.</P>
<P>As Mr. Recorder was plea&s;ed at my Tryal, to &s;ay that the Clau&s;e in the Act of Parlia|ment, by which I now fall, was directly le|velled again&s;t me; and that him&s;elf had fre|quently admoni&s;hed me again&s;t acting in Con|tempt of the &s;ame. I do not pretend to deny it; but pre&s;uming on the Services I did the Publick, by apprehending and bringing to Ju|&s;tice great Numbers of Robbers, at the appa|rent Hazard of my Life; I hoped that Law might have been di&s;pen&s;ed with, and tho&s;e Ser|vices ballance the Inconveniencies ari&s;ing from my recovering &s;tolen Goods; and indeed it was upon this Foundation that I all along acted.</P>
<P>I return Thanks to my Neighbours and others, who did &s;o readily attend at the <HI>Se&s;&s;ions-Hou&s;e</HI> to have te&s;tified for my De|meanour among&s;t them, if there had been Occa&s;ion for it; and to all other Per&s;ons what&s;o|ever who have a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in my Mi&s;ery, and wi&s;hed well to me.</P>
<P>And particularly my dying Thanks to the Reverend Dr. <HI>Knight,</HI> the Reverend Mr. <HI>Ni|chol&s;on,</HI> and the Reverend Mr. <HI>Purney,</HI> for the great Comforts their Chri&s;tian Labours have brought to my Soul; and to all others who have charitably a&s;&s;i&s;ted me to undergo this great Conflict with a Chri&s;tian Fortitude.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on I have to expect ill Treatment from the Poplulace, gives me much Unea&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="79" REF="85">
and &s;trikes me with great Terror. The bar|barous In&s;ults I met with from them after my receiving Sentence of Death at the <HI>Se&s;&s;ions-Hou&s;e,</HI> I believe were &s;uch, as never was &s;hewn before to a Per&s;on in my Circum&s;tances, in no Country upon Earth. I freely forgive them, and all the re&s;t of my Enemies what&s;o|ever, hoping to meet with Forgivene&s;s for all my enormous Crimes and Offences from the Great God of Mercy and Truth, whom I have broughout the whole Cour&s;e of my Life grie|vou&s;ly offended. Lord have Mercy upon me. Lord receive me.</P>
