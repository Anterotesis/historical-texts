<HEAD>THE
PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>THE Town has been amus'd. with a
Story of late about a De&s;ign di&s;covered
at St. <HI>Germans</HI> to have &s;tollen away
the Prince of Wales, and &s;ome of our
News-Writers have been prevail'd with to put
it into their Publick Papers, and be&s;tow it upon
the World.</P>
<P>Since then he that Prints a Story &s;ubjects both
Him&s;elf and his Tale to the Cen&s;ure of every
Reader, I have as much Right as another to pa&s;s
my Judgment in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>And tho' I am fir&s;t a&s;&s;ur'd from very good
Hands, that the Story it &s;elf is a Forgery, and
that at St. <HI>Germains</HI> they know nothing of the
Matter; yet I think it may not be ami&s;s to give
the World &s;ome &s;hort Ob&s;ervatious upon the Sub|ject,
becau&s;e I believe they will quickly hear more
<PB REF="3">
of it. For the Story of Stealing the Prince of
<HI>Wales</HI> was not contriv'd to no purpo&s;e, but as an
Anticedent to &s;omething which was to come after,
which the World is to be acquainted with in good
time, when 'tis fir&s;t ob&s;erv'd how they will reli&s;h
this.</P>
<P>If what I &s;hall &s;ay be Offen&s;ive to &s;uch who
are concern'd for the <HI>Young Gentleman,</HI> they
ought to be angry with the Broachers of the
Story, and not with the Author of the&s;e Ob&s;er|vations.</P>

<HEAD>AN
ARGUMENT,
Shewing, That the
Prince of WALES,
Tho' a PROTESTANT, has no
ju&s;t Preten&s;ions to the
Crown of ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG tho&s;e People who are
more than ordinarily careful for the
Future, it has been a Que&s;tion not
a little debated, What &s;hall we do
for a King in <HI>England</HI> after the Decea&s;e of
his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty and the Prince&s;s in ca&s;e
they &s;hould die without I&s;&s;ue?</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">
And tho' it be properly a Work which no
Body has any thing to do with but a Par|liament,
yet our bu&s;ie Politicians have ran|&s;ack't
Forreign Countries for a King.</P>
<P>Some wi&s;er than others, have propos'd
the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Son, the young Prince
of <HI>Piedmont.</HI> Some one, &s;ome another, as
their Fancies guide them. <HI>Ay,</HI> but &s;ays a
Learned Rabbi, skill'd in the Letter of the
Law, <HI>he is a Roman Catholick, and that
is a Barr by our Con&s;titution. Well,</HI> re|plys
another, <HI>but he may he &s;ent into</HI> Eng|land
<HI>to be Educated a Prote&s;tant.</HI> At the
hearing of which Medium, a Third Party
have thought fit to &s;tart a Ca&s;e on the other
&s;ide; <HI>Why, &s;o may &s;ome body el&s;e?</HI> and &s;o all
Parties become Friends again.</P>
<Q>They that have Ears to hear let them hear.</Q>
<P>Fir&s;t, We thank tho&s;e Gentlemen for &s;a|tisfying
the World that they de&s;pair now
of the Re&s;toration of K<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> <HI>James,</HI> which
has been &s;o long talk'd of, and are content
to Po&s;tpone their Happine&s;s to a Time &s;o
remote, that po&s;&s;ibly it may never come to
pa&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">
And as to the Ca&s;e in hand, if they
think it proper, they may propo&s;e it to the
next Parliament, and no doubt but what
they do in it the Nation will be well &s;atified
with, and in the mean time we refer them
to the Experiment.</P>
<P>But it may not be improper to Exa|mine
here the Project laid to Try the
Nation, How &s;uch a Story would take with
them.</P>
<P>And if you Examine the News-Paper,
you will find it introduc'd into the World
with a <HI>We hear. We hear there has been a De|&s;ign
di&s;cover'd at St. Germans to &s;teal away the
Prince of Wales, and to convey him over into</HI>
England, <HI>to be brought up a Prote&s;tant.</HI></P>
<P>The Writer of this News wou'd be ve|ry
helpful in the Di&s;covery, if he wou'd
hone&s;tly inform the World how and where
he heard the News; whether he had it by
Letter, or Me&s;&s;enger, Po&s;t, or Expre&s;s;
for 'tis certain that no body el&s;e can hear
any thing of it.</P>
<P>If he will own <HI>with more hone&s;ty than he
wrote,</HI> that he really invented it of his own
Head, to help fill up his own Paper, as no
que&s;tion they many times do in other Ca|&s;es;
<PB N="4" REF="7">
It will be the be&s;t Reply to my Sug|ge&s;tions
that any body can make, and I mu&s;t
allow all I am &s;aying is as Impertinent as
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Knavi&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>But if he was directed to write it by &s;ome
body, no matter by who, it mu&s;t be from a
de&s;ign.</P>
<P>I &s;hall attempt therefore to open the Eyes
of the World a little, by Examining the In|coherences
and Incon&s;i&s;tences of the Story,
and then the De&s;ign of it.</P>
<P>As to the Incoherence of the Story, a
di&s;covery of a De&s;ign, but by no Evi|dence,
or Information, no Per&s;ons de|&s;igning
taken, nor none enquired after to
be apprehended, no body nam'd to be di&s;|coverers,
or di&s;covered; &s;o that they are
only &s;uppo&s;ed to be afraid of &s;uch and &s;uch
a thing, and to have doubled the Guards
to prevent it.</P>
<P>Then the Rea&s;on is &s;et down for which
he &s;hou'd be convey'd away, to be carried
into <HI>England.</HI> Had they &s;topt there, &s;ome|thing
might have been meant, &s;ome Mi&s;|chief
might have been &s;uppo&s;ed to have
been de&s;ign'd again&s;t him. But to clear it
up to the World, the very bottom of the
<PB N="5" REF="8">
de&s;ign is laid open, that they &s;hou'd take
the Child away to Educate him <HI>a Prote|&s;tant.</HI></P>
<P>Unle&s;s the Author of this News was let
into the Project I &s;peak of, he wou'd ne|ver
have &s;ugge&s;ted it, but all Man|kind wou'd have thought, that if there
had been any danger of &s;tealing him a|way,
to carry him into <HI>England,</HI> it &s;hou'd
be with &s;ome wicked de&s;ign to <HI>make away
with him,</HI> his coming being death by our
Law, rather then Educate him in the Pro|te&s;tant
Religion.</P>
<P>The Party therefore that cou'd de&s;cend
to the&s;e Particulars, tho' no Evidence be
produc'd, nor no Confe&s;&s;ion made of any
Per&s;on concern'd, mu&s;t I &s;ay be let into the
de&s;ign.</P>
<P>And now I have &s;aid &s;o much of a De|&s;ign,
I de&s;ire to Explain what I mean by
it.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign I mean, is not to &s;teal the
Prince of <HI>Wales, as they call him,</HI> away, and
bring him into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But to broach an Oponion among the
People, That on the failure of the pre&s;ent
Settlement, the Prince of <HI>VVales</HI> is the true
<PB N="6" REF="9">
and lawful Heir of the Crown, and that to
qualifie him to Enjoy it, he may be bred a
Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;tant.</P>
<P>And to in&s;inuate this more finely into
our Fancies it is put the other way, That
they are afraid the Engli&s;h People &s;hou'd
&s;teal him away, to make him a Prote&s;tant
in order to have the Kingdom, whether he
will or no.</P>
<P>I cannot help making a little &s;port of this
Je&s;t&mdash;<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That we &s;hou'd be made believe the
late King wou'd be &s;o chary of this Child
and his Religion, as to prevent his being
declar'd Heir apparent to the Crown of
<HI>England,</HI> on the bare apprehen&s;ions of his
being Educated a Prote&s;tant.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the Engli&s;h &s;hou'd be in &s;uch
di&s;tre&s;s for a Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown, when
God be thank'd there are Two happy Lives
to Enjoy it before hand, as to go abroad to
&s;teal One.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Crown of <HI>England</HI> &s;hou'd be
accounted &s;o mean a thing, that a Guard
&s;hou'd be &s;et upon any body to prevent
their being <HI>&s;pirited away</HI> from the Court
of <HI>France</HI> to be made King of <HI>England.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">
And to add to the ridiculous part of it,
That any body on pretence of Educating
him a Prote&s;tant, &s;hou'd dare to bring him
into <HI>England,</HI> without Licence from the
pre&s;ent Government, as is expre&s;ly pro|vided
for by Act of Parliament. They
wou'd make <HI>a &s;pecial Prote&s;tant</HI> of him in|deed,
where he mu&s;t be a Martyr at fir&s;t
Conver&s;ion, to bring him where &s;etting his
Foot was immediate Death by the Statutes
of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The in&s;inuation therefore of &s;tealing the
Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> to make a Prote&s;tant of
him, is a Figurative Expre&s;&s;ion, a <HI>Metani|my,</HI>
a way of &s;peaking wherein &s;omething
is intended which is not expre&s;&s;ed, and if I
could make it &s;peak Engli&s;h, 'tis thus:</P>
<P><HI>That if you plea&s;e, Gentlemen, to have the
Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>to Reign over you, after the fai|lure
of the pre&s;ent Settlement, he is at your Ser|vice,
and will come and be brought up in the Pro|te&s;tant
Religion, whenever you think fit.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not enter into any Di&s;coveries of
the Nature of the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown of
<HI>England,</HI> nor of the Right of &s;uch Families as
pretend to it, they are things to tender to be
handled here.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="11">
But in this ca&s;e I may pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that
&s;ince the pre&s;ent Settlement of the Crown of
<HI>England</HI> is declar'd by the Parliament of <HI>En|gland,</HI>
own'd by the World, and receiv'd by
the general A&s;cent of the Nation, at the end
of this Settlement the &s;ame Collective Body
of the Nation, are the only Judges of the
Right of any Per&s;on what&s;oever.</P>
<P>And as for the Gentlemen who are &s;o wil|ling
to re&s;tore the Line of King <HI>James,</HI> they
are de&s;ir'd to con&s;ider, that by attempting it
in this method, they come under a Nece&s;&s;ity
of owning the Authority of the Parliament
of <HI>England:</HI> the &s;ame Authority which Ab|dicated
his Father, and by con&s;equence mu&s;t
ju&s;tifie all the Proceedings of the late Revo|lution,
and this will be a bitter Pill to them.</P>
<P>Not but that &s;tranger things than the&s;e
have been done too for a Crown, but this
mu&s;t be done before an Engli&s;h Parliament
can &s;o much as con&s;ider of it; nay by &s;ugge&s;t|ing,
or &s;o much as &s;uppo&s;ing his Right to be
referr'd to the Engli&s;h Nation, it mu&s;t at the
&s;ame time be &s;uppos'd that he wou'd not
&s;tick at all that to be declar'd capable of In|heriting
the Crown of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;uch contradictory and incon|&s;tent
<PB N="9" REF="12">
things, as makes the Story very ridicu|lous,
and &s;hows the Party is driven to <HI>&s;trange
&s;hifts</HI> to bring to pa&s;s their de&s;igns, and wou'd
comply with any thing to get the Reins in
their hands again.</P>
<P>Now if they only want to know how the
Nation wou'd re&s;ent an Attempt of this Na|ture,
they may be &s;oon &s;atisfied in that point,
by moving it in Parliament; and in the mean
time they need not pretend to keep a Guard
upon him at St. <HI>Germain,</HI> for I dare &s;ay the
Engli&s;h Nation will as &s;oon &s;teal away his Fa|ther
as him, and they have not &s;hown them|&s;elves
&s;o fond of either, as to make them a|fraid
of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not at all enter into the Enquiry
concerning the Legitimacy of his Birth, nor
quote the learned Authorities of the eminent
Mr. <HI>Fuller</HI> on that Head, who&s;e Evidence is to
as much purpo&s;e as the matter is in&s;ignificant.</P>
<P>For be it &s;o, that King <HI>James</HI> is the true Fa|ther
of the Child, it matters not one farthing
in the Title to the Crown; for his Father,
who&s;e Legitimacy no body doubts, by being
a Roman Catholick, has rendred him&s;elf un|capable
of the Government, and &s;o does the
Son, and Settlements are not to be alter'd eve|ry
<PB N="10" REF="13">
time he thinks fit to alter his Religion.</P>
<P>But methinks it remains as an Eternal
Mark either of the Folly, or Pride of his Pa|rents,
that if the Queen was really with
Child (which (<HI>God forgive me if I am mi|&s;taken</HI>)
I never believed) &s;he did not put it
pa&s;t all po&s;&s;ibility of Debate, by giving &s;uch
undeniable proofs of it, <HI>as 'tis known &s;uch Ca|&s;es
will admit of,</HI> and that to tho&s;e Per&s;ons in
particular as &s;he knew wou'd be very &s;orry
to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>The Queen was not a Lady of &s;o much
Nicety, as that &s;he &s;hou'd decline letting &s;uch
Female Effects of her Conception be known,
<HI>e&s;pecially to her own Sex,</HI> as wou'd have con|founded
all Gain&s;ayers.</P>
<P>Nor did &s;he want the Vanity of &s;hewing
tho&s;e invincible Demon&s;trations to &s;ome
Per&s;ons in the Court, to whom &s;he might
have rea&s;on to think the truth, would have
been a particular Mortification.</P>
<P>The truth then being &s;o ea&s;ie to be made
plain, <HI>and tho&s;e ea&s;ie &s;teps being omitted,</HI> gives
me more cau&s;e of doubt in the Matter, than
all the Affirmatives of Evidence <HI>Fuller</HI> can do,
for it was not a thing for the Nation to prove
a Negative upon, as &s;ome have pretended to
<PB N="11" REF="14">
expect, but they in who&s;e power it was once
to make it plain, having omitted it, Man|kind
ought to doubt the truth of it, becau&s;e
had it been true, none but Madmen, or wor&s;e,
would have conceal'd any part of it.</P>
<P>Nor does the Declaration of the pre&s;ent
King, when Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> &s;ay any more,
than that there was ground to &s;u&s;pect it;
and then concludes, <HI>that the Examination both
of it, and the Right of Succe&s;&s;ion, is referr'd to
a free Parliament.</HI> Which Parliament having
&s;ettled the Succe&s;&s;ion, according to that Ar|ticle
on the unexpected Occa&s;ion of the Ab|dication
of King <HI>James,</HI> and his carrying this
Son on whom the doubt was rais'd into
<HI>France,</HI> to be brought up a Papi&s;t, <HI>Examining
into his Birth became needle&s;s;</HI> and it &s;ignifies
nothing whether he be Legitimate, or no;
his Father rendred them both incapable, by
the Article of Religion, and the Nation has
&s;ettled the Succe&s;&s;ion another way.</P>
<P>This, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, I think to be the
true &s;tate of the Ca&s;e, and will pa&s;s for &s;uch
with me, till I &s;ee it &s;tated otherwi&s;e by &s;ome
body that under&s;tands it better than I do.</P>
<P>But &s;ome have &s;tarted a Ca&s;e which re|quires
a word or two of Reply.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15">
<HI>If the Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>be allowed to be the
Legitimate Son of King</HI> James, <HI>and had been a
Prote&s;tant, there had been no Objection against
his Title.</HI></P>
<P>This has a plain An&s;wer in the &s;equel of
the Story. The Abdication of King <HI>James</HI>
did not con&s;i&s;t in his Male-admini&s;tration,
<HI>but in his de&s;erting the Nation;</HI> and it may be
remembred that there was great &s;trugling
for the Word in the <HI>Convention,</HI> &s;ome
wou'd have had the word <HI>De&s;erted</HI> voted in|&s;tead
of <HI>Abdicated.</HI></P>
<P>Now if King <HI>James</HI> De&s;erted the Nation,
&s;o did his Son with him, and thereby the
Throne became vacant, and the power of
Government devolv'd upon &s;uch as were
next Heirs; and who they were was to be
decided by the Parliament, who have been
allow'd to be the Judges of the Right of
Succe&s;&s;ion in all Ages.</P>
<P>Now the Parliament did not upon this
Vacancy of the Throne proceed to Elect a
King, <HI>as &s;ome People are mighty fond of &s;aying,</HI>
and &s;o alter our Con&s;titution to an Elective
Monarchy.</P>
<P>But they proceeded to Examine who&s;e
the Right of Government was, and to make
<PB N="13" REF="16">
a Declaration of that Right by Authority of
Parliament, and King <HI>James</HI> and his Son,
<HI>if he be his Son,</HI> having left the Kingdom,
they declared that the Throne was thereby
vacant, that is, by their deferting the People,
and that the Succe&s;&s;ion ought to de&s;cend &s;o
and &s;o; which Succe&s;&s;ion they farther con|firm'd
by the Sanction of an Act of Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>Had K. <HI>James</HI> notwith&s;tanding his Male|admini&s;tration,
continued in the Kingdom,
tho' he might have been Depo&s;ed, yet the
Parliament mu&s;t have gone upon other mea|&s;ures
to have transferr'd the Succe&s;&s;ion to
the Crown from him to another Head.</P>
<P>On this account it is that the King and
Queen of <HI>England</HI> are declared rightful and
lawful.</P>
<P>And on this Foundation the young Gen|tleman
we &s;peak of, tho' he were the Legi|timate
Son of King <HI>James,</HI> and a Prote&s;tant,
yet having de&s;erted the People of <HI>England</HI>
with his Father, has equally abdicated the
Government, and the Throne was thereby
vacant.</P>
<P>The Point of Religion is the next Barr;
the Commons of <HI>England</HI> at the fir&s;t Meet|ing
<PB N="14" REF="17">
of the Convention, did not make any
new Laws, but only made a Declaration of
what was before the undoubted Right of the
People of <HI>England,</HI> and what ought to be
ob&s;erv'd by any Prince who &s;hou'd hereafter
&s;ucceed in the Government, and in order to
obviate all Objections <HI>again&s;t</HI> the continuing
under the Government of King <HI>James,</HI> and
before they had entred upon ths Con&s;idera|tion
or his having gone away and left them,
they laid a firm Foundation of a Regular
Government, in a Me&s;&s;age to the Lords,
carried up by Mr. <HI>Hampden,</HI> and a Body of
their Members, in which the Vote of the
Hou&s;e was read at the Barr of the Hou&s;e of
Lords, thus:</P>
<P>Re&s;olved <HI>Nemine Contradicente,</HI>
<Q>That it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;tituti|on
of this Prote&s;tant Kingdom, to be
governed by a Popi&s;h Prince.</Q></P>
<P>Now how a Popi&s;h Prince may pretend to
be converted and turn Prote&s;tant, to obtain a
Crown, and how often he may turn and re|turn
on the &s;ame account, and whether the
Settlement of the Succe&s;&s;ion is oblig'd to
change with him; or how far a Parliament
wou'd think them&s;elves oblig'd to take notice
<PB N="15" REF="18">
of &s;uch changes of the Religion of a Prince,
the&s;e are things not for me to determine.</P>
<P>But this I dare be free to determine, that
no Parliament will &s;end into <HI>France</HI> to &s;teal
away a Prince to make a Prote&s;tant of, and
&s;o force him to accept of the Crown of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
whether he will or no, and e&s;pecially a
Per&s;on whom they thought fit to leave whol|ly
out of their Settlement before.</P>
<P>So that the&s;e Gentlemen may &s;ave them|&s;elves
the labour of attempting the Conver|&s;ion
of this Prince, for the Settlement of our
Succe&s;&s;ion was not built upon his being a Ro|man
Catholick, but upon the Abdication of
his Father, and &s;o far upon his own, as his
Birth &s;hall appear to give him a Title; &s;ince
he has from that time forward ab&s;ented him|&s;elf
from the Kingdom to which his preten|ces,
<HI>if he had any,</HI> were to be made.</P>
<P>It may be ask'd here, To what end and
purpo&s;e K. <HI>James</HI> convey'd him away, if he
had any confidence in the po&s;&s;ibility of clear|ing
up the point of his Legitimacy, he might
have left him here, it was impracticable, that
any violence cou'd have been pretended to be
acted upon him, for nothing cou'd have been
charg'd upon him, if the Illegitimacy of his
<PB N="16" REF="19">
Birth had been alledg'd, the proof wou'd have
been put upon the Nations &s;ide, till which no|thing
cou'd legally have been done to his pre|judice,
but as it is, the proof remains at their
own doors, which &s;ince they thought fit to o|mit,
I &s;ee no concern the Nation has in the
matter.</P>
<P>For, &s;uppo&s;e Q. <HI>Mary</HI> had really been with
Child, and had, <HI>for as wi&s;e ends as other things
were then done,</HI> thought fit never to let it be
known, and a Child had been born in the
dark, and bred up in private, and the Nation
knew nothing of the matter, but that twen|ty
years after, when the Parliament might
have &s;ettled the Succe&s;&s;ion another way, this
Child &s;hou'd be Trumpt up as a right Heir
to the Crown.</P>
<P>It wou'd be never the le&s;s true that he was
K. <HI>James</HI>'s Son, and he wou'd have as much
right to the Crown as a real Son; but who
wou'd have believ'd it; wou'd not the Na|tion
&s;ay, and rea&s;on good, <HI>Why, was it not
told us that the Queen was with Child? Why,
was not &s;ome of the Royal Family entru&s;ted with
the knowledge of it? Why was not the
Queen's being with Child made known, and
the Prote&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t Ladies of the Court &s;hown</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="20"><HI>&s;uch proofs of it as that they might be able to
te&s;tifie the truth of it</HI>&mdash;wou'd it be enough
to &s;ay it was below the Queen to trouble her
head about it, and &s;he did not think the &s;ati&s;|faction
of the Nation worth her while.</P>
<P>I que&s;tion whether any Nation in <HI>Europe</HI>
wou'd accept of a King upon &s;uch terms; we
&s;ee 'tis quite otherwi&s;e in <HI>France,</HI> where all the
Princes of the Blood are at liberty, and claim
it as a priviledge to come into the very
Chamber of the Queen when &s;he is in Tra|vail,
and to &s;ee the Infant as &s;oon as 'tis come
into the World.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e thus &s;tated, I put it upon all the
Champions of their Party to di&s;prove the Ar|gument
which I lay down in the&s;e few words.</P>
<P><HI>That the Per&s;ons on whom the proof of his
Legitimacy lay, having omitted the Legal de|mon&s;trations
of it, which they ought to have gi|ven,
'tis very rea&s;onable that we &s;hou'd que&s;tion
the truth of it.</HI></P>
<P>And while the Ligitimacy of his Birth re|mains
a que&s;tion, the People of <HI>England</HI> ought
not to trouble their heads about him, for 'tis
not for us to enquire of it, but they &s;hou'd
have made it out who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was.</P>
<P>Thus far the rea&s;on of the Ca&s;e is plain,
<PB N="18" REF="21">
without any need to go to proving of Nega|tives.</P>
<P>And while it is thus, they may even take
their double Guards off of him again, for if
he is ever Kidnap'd away to make a Prote|&s;tant
of, we mu&s;t be reduc'd to very hard
terms, and the Engli&s;h Crown go a begging
at a mo&s;t pitiful rate.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I am no Friend to a Common|wealth
Government in <HI>England</HI> when I re|flect
on the la&s;t, how ill it was manag'd, and
how &s;oon it fell into Di&s;orders and Parties,
and how little a while it continu'd; but I had
rather &s;ee a Commonwealth &s;et up, or any
thing (Popery excepted) than that we &s;hou'd
be brought to &s;eek a King at the French
Court, and one that we have repudiated as
born in hugger-mugger, no body knows how,
nor where, and that his Mother did not
think it worth while to give the Engli&s;h Na|tion
&s;atisfaction about when &s;he was with
Child, but on the contrary, &s;corn'd the At|tempts
of &s;ome of the fir&s;t Quality to make
the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>But that which adds to the Banter too, is
that we &s;hou'd &s;teal him away. <HI>Ble&s;s us all!</HI>
that we &s;hou'd turn <HI>Kidnappers</HI> for a King,
<PB N="19" REF="22">
and &s;pirit folks Children away, <HI>for let him be
who&s;e Son he will, 'tis certain he is &s;ome bodies,</HI> to
make Kings of them.</P>
<P>The truth on't is, it is not a light matter
to be a King of <HI>England.</HI> 'Tis a Po&s;t of great
Difficulty as well as Honour, and perhaps K.
<HI>James</HI> may be afraid to venture his Son, lea&s;t
he &s;hou'd have no better &s;ucce&s;s than him|&s;elf,
which wou'd certaily fall out if he took
his Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>But to think that the Engli&s;h Nation &s;hou'd
ever entertain &s;uch thoughts of his Son, <HI>allow he
were &s;o,</HI> as to take him away by &s;tealth. I cannot
call it an affront to the Nation, 'tis rather a
Banter upon the poor young Gentleman, who
I dare &s;ay knows not a word of the matter.</P>
<P>I remember I have heard it &s;aid before the
Fire of <HI>London</HI> happen'd, news was carried
down into the Country that the City was
burnt, and was reported publickly above 100
Miles from <HI>London,</HI> at lea&s;t two days before
the Fire began, which was a certain Token
of a de&s;ign to bring it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>If I &s;hou'd judge of the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e by the
practice of tho&s;e People, I &s;hou'd expect to
hear next Po&s;t that this young Prince is re|ally
lo&s;t, carried away, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the un&s;peak|able
<PB N="20" REF="23">
Grief of his Parents, and the Di&s;tur|bance
of the whole Court, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not venture to &s;ay it will be &s;o, but
I may venture to &s;ay there are &s;everal Turns
of State in the World which &s;uch a Thing
may an&s;wer.</P>
<P>As fir&s;t, If it &s;hou'd be true that at the bot|tom
of the bu&s;ine&s;s, this was not the Legiti|mate
Son of K. <HI>James,</HI> which however uncer|tain
we are of it, it is well enough known to
them&s;elves&mdash;Why now they &s;ee the Sham
won't take, and they have ran the Je&s;t &s;o far
as that they have ruin'd them&s;elves, and the
Show is over, they will of cour&s;e be &s;oon wea|ry
of the Child, and as a Plot made a Prince
of him, &s;o another may reduce him to what
they plea&s;e; he may be lo&s;t in the dark, and
be heard of no more, and give it out, that the
Engli&s;h have carry'd him away to re&s;erve him
in <HI>Petto,</HI> as the Pope does his Cardinals, to
make a King of him when they want one, and
in the mean time bring him up a Heretick.</P>
<P>This is an ea&s;y way to be rid of him when|ever
they plea&s;e, and &s;o the poor young Gen|tleman
had better have appear'd in the world
what he really was&mdash;nor do we want In&s;tan|ces
of Impo&s;tors &s;et up in the World to per|&s;onate
<PB N="21" REF="24">
Princes who have afterwards vani&s;h'd
as they came when the Per&s;ons who &s;et them
up cou'd not bring to pa&s;s their de&s;igns by it.</P>
<P>Or if we &s;hou'd &s;uppo&s;e that the King of
<HI>France</HI> has his Eyes on the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
(as he has lately had on that of <HI>Spain</HI>)
in right of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and po&s;|&s;ibly
may oblige King <HI>James</HI> to make the &s;e|cond
Experiment of leaving him the Crown
by his la&s;t Will and Te&s;tament, I do not &s;ay
&s;uch Chimera's as the&s;e are in the heads of
any body, but I do &s;ay that if they are, 'twill
be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to remove the Per|&s;on
we are &s;peaking of out of the way.</P>
<P>And what likelier Project can they have
to rid them&s;elves of him, and as they may
think, at the &s;ame time to make the Nation
unea&s;y, then to give out that the Engli&s;h have
carried him away to make a Prote&s;tant of
him.</P>
<P>The&s;e are Ends&punc; I &s;ay, that &s;uch a thing will
&s;erve, and I may be excu&s;ed making &s;uch re|mote
Gue&s;&s;es and Suppo&s;itions, for none of
them are &s;o wild and chimerical, as the fan|cy
of bringing him hither.</P>
<P>And if any &s;uch Mea&s;ures &s;hou'd be taken
with the young Gentlemen, I think a &s;ingle
<PB N="22" REF="25">
Author may venture to enter this Prote&s;t in
the Name of the whole Nation, that 'tis a
Trick of their own, and the Engli&s;h Nation
can have no hand in it.</P>
<P>The Authority of the Nation cannot have
any hand in it, becau&s;e they can do nothing
in private, and it mu&s;t be known if it had
been Parliamentary.</P>
<P>The hone&s;t prote&s;tant loyal Party cannot
be &s;aid to have a hand in it, becau&s;e Mankind
is &s;aid not to be able to do that which their
known Intere&s;t forbids them to do, and no
body can imagine that Party &s;hould ever de|&s;ign
to bring him hither, without imagining
at the &s;ame time that it was to Murther and
De&s;troy him, which God forbid.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Engli&s;h Party, they can|not
de&s;ign it, becau&s;e 'twill not any way an|&s;wer
their de&s;igns.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> If ever they &s;hou'd have power to
make him a King publickly, 'tis plain he will
serve their turn as well if he be a Papi&s;t as a
Prote&s;tant, or el&s;e they cannot be what we call
them, <HI>Jacobites,</HI> that is, Friends to King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If they bring him in only to re&s;erve
him in <HI>Petto,</HI> as I &s;aid, it mu&s;t be one of the&s;e
two ways, either publickly or privately.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26">
If publickly, unle&s;s they have a Force to
defend him, they bring him only to Martyr|dom,
for our Laws will take immediate hold
on him, and put him to death.</P>
<P>If privately, to be re&s;erv'd till the Line &s;hall
fail, he mu&s;t then re&s;ide <HI>Incognito,</HI> and if ever
the time &s;hou'd come to &s;et him up, having
been lo&s;t &s;o many years, no body wou'd know
him, and the Nation wou'd never believe
'twas he, which wou'd always leave room
for Impo&s;tors, and &s;etting up &s;ham Princes to
mi&s;e In&s;urrections, and di&s;turb the publick
<HI>Peace</HI> of the Nation, as in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Perkin
Warbeck</HI> and <HI>Ralph Wilford</HI> in the days' of
<HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh.</P>
<P>So that rightly examin'd, this Sham will
never fa&s;ten upon the Engli&s;h Nation, for it
will an&s;wer the Ends of neither Friend nor
Foe.</P>
<P>But if ever we hear that the <HI>Prince</HI> of
<HI>Wales,</HI> as they call him, is lo&s;t, carried away,
it mu&s;t either be that <HI>they</HI> are con&s;cious to
them&s;elves of his being a fo&s;ter Son, and the
de&s;ign having mi&s;carried, are weary of the
Adopt, and &s;o have di&s;mi&s;t him this World;
or el&s;e that he is remov'd to try another
Fetch for the Engli&s;h Crown by way of Ti|tle,
<PB N="24" REF="27">
which, if the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Piedmont</HI> dies, falls
by Inheritance, the Barr of Religion excep|ted,
to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> in right of the
Wife of the pre&s;ent Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI>
who is Grand-daughter to a Daughter of
<HI>England</HI> by King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t.</P>
<P>And as to the Barr of Religion, pray what's
that to a good Army; What's the Go&s;pel to
a Kettle Drum? or Ju&s;tice and Laws to a Re|giment
of Curia&s;&s;eeres? If the French King
comes once to have a fair Claim to the Crown
of <HI>England</HI> for his Grand&s;on, and you have
nothing to plead in Barr but his Religion,
he'll talk with you about that in other
Terms&mdash;</P>
<P>You mu&s;t certainly expect to talk in the
In&s;ernal Language of Fire and Smoke, and
tho' tis hoped we &s;hov'd have Zeal enough
for our Religion, to fight him to the la&s;t
Ga&s;p, yet all Men mu&s;t allow the <HI>Power</HI> of
<HI>France,</HI> at this time is &s;o great, that 'twould
be much better never to have it brought to
a Trial.</P>
