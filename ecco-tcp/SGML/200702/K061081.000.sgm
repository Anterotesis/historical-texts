<P>_I Am told, that a Book without a Preface, is like a New Play without a Prologue, or a <HI>French</HI> Dinner without Soup; and tho' I cannot tell what to &s;ay, yet I am re|&s;olv'd to &s;ay &s;omething, tho' perhaps not any thing to the Purpo&s;e. So far I hope you'll allow me to be an Author. I &s;hall give you, gentle Reader, (if you are &s;o) Three of my Rea&s;ons why I publi&s;h the&s;e following Pages; which, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, are not &s;o well poli&s;h'd as I cou'd wi&s;h, but Truth is amiable tho' in Rags. The fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t, to get Money; for tho' I have a con&s;idera|ble Income, yet I can never bring both points together at the Year's End; but how|ever, don't blame my Oeconomy, &s;ince I owe you nothing, and if I am beholden to any Body, it is to Hone&s;t <HI>Chetwood,</HI> my Book&s;eller; (I beg his Pardon if I mi&s;call him, tho' I don't believe it will anger him in the lea&s;t, for all Men love to be term'd &s;o, whether they de&s;erve it or no) being he will run the greate&s;t Ri&s;que if my Book does not &s;ell.

my Friends the&s;e following Adventures, for now they may at a &s;mall Expence get 'em by Heart, if they will endeavour to &s;tretch their Memories. Third and la&s;tly, to appear in Print, which was, I a&s;&s;ure you, a great Motive with me as well as with a great many others of the &s;ame Rank, that make Work for many Prin|ters, tho' as little to the Purpo&s;e as my &s;elf. I cou'd give a Catalogue of &s;ome of 'em, but that wou'd be making my Preface exceed the Bulk of my Book.

<HEAD>THE VOYAGES AND ADVENTURES OF <HI>Capt.</HI> RICHARD FALCONER. BOOK I.</HEAD>
<P>_I WAS born at a Town call'd <HI>Bruton,</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> of Parents tolerably well to pa&s;s in the World; my Mother dy'd when I was very young: My Father, <HI>Richard Falconer,</HI> had been a great Traveller in his Days, and his frequently
<PB N="2" REF="8">
repeating his Adventures abroad, made me have a great De&s;ire to follow his Steps: I often begg'd he would let me go to Sea with &s;ome Captain of his Acquaintance; but he would often &s;ay, <HI>Dick,</HI> &s;tay where you are, you know not the Hazard and Dan|gers attend a maritime Life: You &s;hall have a good Trade in your Belly, and that will keep you from a De&s;ire of rambling; there|fore tell me what Calling you like be&s;t, that I may immediately put you out in Order to your living hereafter: You know, conti|nu'd he, that my Fortune is but &s;mall, and I living to the extent of it, it will not be po&s;&s;ible for me to leave you wherewithal to &s;upport you without &s;ome Employment. Therefore, (reply'd I) as you have a Daugh|ter, you may leave your Sub&s;tance to her, &s;he mu&s;t be provided for; as for our Sex, we can be&s;t take Care for our &s;elves, and if you plea&s;e but to fit me out to Sea, even in what Station you think convenient, it &s;hall be all I will de&s;ire. Son, (&s;ays my Father) think no more of going to Sea, for I'll not have it &s;o; I know it is only a De&s;ire of Youth, prone to change: If I &s;hould give you leave, I am a&s;&s;ur'd one Week's Voyage would make you wi&s;h to be at home again. I us'd all the Arguments my young Sen&s;e prompted me with, but all to no purpo&s;e, my Father was not to be mov'd, and thus
<PB N="3" REF="9">
I liv'd two Years longer with him in Expectation of his Mind altering. At la&s;t an Accident happen'd that farther'd my De&s;ires, and tho' it was the Ruin of our Family, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was not much concern'd.</P>
<P>My Father was Supervi&s;or of a Tax laid upon the burning of Pipes, and he having gather'd a Sum of Money, amounting to 3800 <HI>l.</HI> in order to pay in to the Govern|ment for the King's U&s;e, was by an under Exci&s;e-man, robb'd of the whole Sum, who made his E&s;cape. My Father us'd all po&s;&s;ible Means to apprehend him without Noi&s;e, but all his Endeavours were fruit|le&s;s: &s;o finding his Affairs in a de&s;perate Condition, re&s;olv'd to retire to &s;ome Part of the World, where he might be &s;afe from the griping Hands of the Law. One Morning ju&s;t before his voluntary Exile, he call'd me to him: <HI>Dick</HI> (&s;ays he) you have been often de&s;irous of going to Sea, and I have always us'd Arguments to di&s;|&s;uade you from it; but now &s;ince what has happen'd, it being impo&s;&s;ible for me to continue upon the Place of my Birth, the Patrimony of my Ance&s;tors, I mu&s;t e'en recommend that way of Life to you which I &s;hould never have cho&s;e, but that the Exigency of my Affairs will not permit me to provide any other Way for
<PB N="4" REF="10">
you. Here (continu'd he) take this 100 <HI>l&punc;</HI> which I can ill &s;pare out of my little For|tune, but &s;ince it is all I can do for you, take it, and may Heaven pro&s;per thy Un|dertakings; may the Ble&s;&s;ing of a Father always live with you, who&s;e Prayers &s;hall ever be &s;ent to our Almighty Creator for thy Welfare. Here (added he) is a Let|ter of Recommendation for you to Cap|tain <HI>Pultney,</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> who&s;e Friend|&s;hip I am &s;ure will be of &s;ervice to you. With that, he embrac'd me with Tears in his Eyes, gave me his Ble&s;&s;ing, ki&s;s'd me and took his leave for ever, for never have my Eyes beheld him &s;ince.</P>
<P>This Parting, I think, was the greate&s;t Grief my Thoughts had ever known 'till then; (for nothing could be fonder, or &s;hew more paternal Affection, than my dear Father at his la&s;t Farewel) but the Joy of my being at Liberty to follow my own De&s;ires, &s;oon drowned my Sorrow for parting with &s;o good a Parent.</P>
<P>I had now nothing to do but to pro|vide my little Equipage in order to go to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> to my Father's Friend; I pack'd up my Things in a Portmantua, and gave them to an old Servant of my Father's, who would &s;ee me as far as <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> for his &s;ake. We &s;et out in the Morning, and reach'd it by Noon: I enquir'd for
<PB N="5" REF="11">
Captain <HI>Pultney,</HI> and by good Fortune found him at his Dwelling Hou&s;e, in <HI>Rat|cliff</HI> Street, he having remov'd him&s;elf from another Street, which caus'd &s;ome Difficulty in the finding. I acquainted him who I was, and gave him my Father's Letter. He read it, and receiv'd me very kindly: It was to this Effect.</P>

<P><HI>I</HI> Hope you'll forgive this Trouble of your Friend. I have &s;ent my Son to you, in order to get him &s;ome Po&s;t by Sea, I know it is in your Power to do it: &s;ome|thing has happen'd that hinders my pro|viding for him as I ought. I would have waited on you in Per&s;on, but a Gap has happen'd in my Affairs that I &s;hall never clo&s;e again. <HI>Dick</HI> will tell you all. Let me conjure you by our old Friend&s;hip to take all the Care you can of him; and whenever he comes to <HI>England,</HI> let him come to you, for as yet I know not where to lead my wretched Life; &s;o that I &s;hall confide in you, and let you know by a Let|ter, or Me&s;&s;enger, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, where I &s;hall &s;ettle;</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12">
Mr. <HI>Falconer,</HI> (&s;ays the Captain) I am heartily &s;orry for your Father's Misfortunes, which he tells me in his Letter you will inform me of. After I had given him the whole Story, he told me he would provide for me as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and till then I &s;hould be as welcome to him as his own Son: In the mean time, &s;ays he, I would have you ver&s;e your &s;elf in the Mathematicks, which may be of u&s;e to you: I'll take Care to provide you a Ma&s;ter, and In&s;truments; which accordingly he did; and as I had a great De&s;ire to be a|broad, and had &s;ome &s;mall Knowledge of it which I learn'd at School, apart from my other Studies, I &s;oon attain'd to the Theory of it.</P>
<P>After I had run through the Cour&s;e of Mathematicks, and the Captain was in|form'd I was capable, he got me to be Mate (or rather A&s;&s;i&s;tant) on board the <HI>Albion</HI> Frigate, Captain <HI>Wa&s;e</HI> Commander; and on the 2<HI>d</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> 1699, we &s;et &s;ail, (bound for <HI>Jamaica)</HI> with a fair Wind. As &s;oon as we lo&s;t &s;ight of Land, I began to be extremely Sea-&s;ick, and bore the Je&s;ts of the Sailors but indifferently; who cry'd, There's an excellent Ma&s;ter's-Mate, he'll hit <HI>Jamaica</HI> to a Hair, if the I&s;land were no bigger than the Bung-hole of a Cask. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I believe my &s;elf
<PB N="7" REF="13">
to be the only Per&s;on who ever &s;et out on his fir&s;t Voyage, as Ma&s;ter's-Mate, with|out having &s;een a River that was naviga|ble. But in a Day or two I was perfect|ly well, and was never troubled with any Sickne&s;s afterwards.</P>
<P>We had nothing material happen'd to us 'till we enter'd the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> where we were encounter'd with a dreadful Storm; the Billows ran Mountains high, and our Ve&s;&s;el &s;eem'd to be the Sport of the Waves: A Ship that overtook us the Day before, and accompany'd us, tho' it were not at Half a Furlong di&s;tance, was &s;ometimes lo&s;t, by rea&s;on of the Heighth of the Waves. The Storm continu'd with this Violence three Days, and at la&s;t abated &s;omething of its Fiercene&s;s, but &s;till blew very hard. The other Ve&s;&s;el by firing a Gun, and mak|ing a Signal, made it appear &s;he was in di&s;tre&s;s, but the Sea ran &s;o high it was im|po&s;&s;ible to give them any A&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet we bore down to them (being to wind|ward) as nigh as we could without Danger to our &s;elves; we enquir'd into the Mat|ter, and found &s;he had &s;prung a Leak; they had all Hands to pump by turns, but yet the Water gain'd on them. They begg'd of us to hoi&s;t out our Boat (their own being &s;tav'd) to give them Succour upon occa&s;ion: Accordingly we put out our
<PB N="8" REF="14">
Long-Boat, with two of our Men in it, but the Rope that held her to the Ship broke by the Violence of the Waves, and drove away with the two unfortunate Men in her, and what became of them we could never learn; but undoubtedly they peri&s;h'd by the Sea, or Hunger, we being 70 Leagues from any Shore. The Ship, after prodigious Labour of the Sailors, and in le&s;s than ten Minutes, &s;unk to the Bot|tom; out of Fifty &s;even Men, but Four were &s;av'd, and they, by good Fortune, laid hold on Ropes we threw out for that Purpo&s;e; but it had not been po&s;&s;ible to &s;ave any, if we had not bore down to Leeward when we &s;aw them in the la&s;t Extremity. And here we ought to ad|mire at Providence; For this very Ve&s;&s;el was a Pyrate, one Captain <HI>Jones,</HI> Com|mander, who in an open large Boat &s;et out from <HI>Dover,</HI> and near <HI>O&s;tend</HI> &s;tole upon a <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el in the Night, mur|der'd the Captain and &s;ome others, and &s;et all the Sailors a-&s;hore that would not embrace their De&s;igns, and had re&s;olv'd to attack us as &s;oon as the Storm was over. The Four Men that were &s;av'd, were three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, and one <HI>French</HI> Man, who &s;aid they were forc'd, with &s;everal others, by the above mention'd Captain <HI>Jones,</HI> to take to that Cour&s;e of Life; but whe|ther
<PB N="9" REF="15">
true or fal&s;e, I can't tell; indeed they behav'd them&s;elves very well with us all the Voyage, and were enter'd into our Books as Four of the Ship's Crew, in|&s;tead of Two we left on Shore, who were not to be found when we &s;et &s;ail, and the two poor Wretches that were lo&s;t in the Boat. The Storm &s;till continu'd, but the Wind fair, &s;o we ran it away with a riv'd Fore|&s;ail all Night, and the next Morning we had a violent Storm of Rain, and &s;ome Thunder, but about Noon the Sky clear'd up, the Rain ceas'd, and the Tempe&s;t was laid; the Wind however continuing fair, with a midling Gale.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 28th. we di&s;cover'd the <HI>Cana|ries</HI> and the Pike of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> and pa&s;s'd this I&s;land, or rather Rock, of a prodigi|ous Heighth. At Night the Wind ro&s;e again, and continu'd to blow very hard for two Days. As I was walking on the Deck one Morning, my Chops were &s;a|luted with a Fi&s;h which drop'd down; I took it up, panting at the Gills for Life; it prov'd to be a flying Fi&s;h, pur&s;u'd (as I &s;uppo&s;e) by &s;ome Dolphin, or Albecore; the Manner of the&s;e Fi&s;hes avoiding their Enemies, is jumping out of the Water, and flying 'till their Wings are dry, then fall down again into the Sea. The Dol|phin that cha&s;es them is one of the fine&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="16">
colour'd Fi&s;h that &s;wims. I have ob&s;erv'd our Painters draw them bending like a Bow; but I think it is as &s;trait a Fi&s;h as any in the Sea. We caught one of them with a Fizgig, an In&s;trument made of &s;e|veral Rows of iron Spikes, bearded like Hooks, and a Staff four or five Foot long to it; to this they tye a Cord of a great length, and dart it with all their Strength; the wounded Fi&s;h immediately flownces downward many Fathoms, and up again, which the Darter ob&s;erves, giving him Rope and Play 'till his Weakne&s;s makes him more tame; then they draw him up the Ship's-&s;ide, and cut him in Pieces. The fir&s;t we caught in this Manner was about &s;ix Foot long, which we dre&s;s'd, and part of it &s;erv'd the whole Ship's Com|pany for Dinner; as &s;oon as it was caught it lo&s;t that beautiful Colour it had in the Water; as for my own Part, notwith&s;tand|ing their prai&s;ing it, I had rather eat a Herring or a Mackrel than this rare Fi&s;h. I don't know whether the&s;e Fi&s;h can hear, or love Mu&s;ick, but this I am &s;ure of, we had an excellent Trumpet on board, which diverted us in good Weather, and I have ob&s;erv'd, that at the Sound of it the Number of the&s;e Dolphins &s;eem'd to en|crea&s;e, and &s;wim within two Foot of our Ve&s;&s;el; but that may be pure Accident;
<PB N="11" REF="17">
yet I fancy there's &s;omething in't, that oc|ca&s;ion'd the Fable of <HI>Amphion</HI> and the Dol|phin. Sharks are taken as we take com|mon Fi&s;h, only the Hook is about two Foot long, and an iron Chain above that about four Foot long, and a long Rope to that; they generally bait the Hook with a Piece of Beef of three or four Pounds, which the voracious Fi&s;h &s;wallows imme|diately, Hook and all; then they give him play a while, and when he is pretty well &s;pent, they draw him in with a Tackle: There's always one &s;tands ready with an Axe to make a Divorce between his Tail and his Body, otherwi&s;e he would give &s;uch large Thumps with it that might do the Ship Damage: I my &s;elf was thrown down but with a Touch of it. This that we took, had in his Paunch the Collar|bone of a Man, and a Boat&s;wain's &s;ilver Whi&s;tle, with a red Ribbon in it, entire, not &s;o much as bruis'd, which was given to me as a Pre&s;ent, to make me amends for the Fall I receiv'd; it may be &s;een at my Book&s;eller's, if any one has the Cu|rio&s;ity to ask for it; as to the Collar-bone, not any one would accept of it, &s;o I re|turn'd it to the watry Element again.</P>
<P>We pa&s;t the <HI>Tropick,</HI> attended by the <HI>Tropick</HI>-Birds, a Fowl &s;omething bigger than a Pidgeon; but one would think, as
<PB N="12" REF="18">
it flies, it had an unlighted Candle fix'd in its Tail. I cannot let go the Cere|mony of pa&s;&s;ing this <HI>Tropick:</HI> When you are in the Latitude, the old Sailors ask the re&s;t of the Ship's Crew, Whether they were ever that way before? If not, they mu&s;t either pay a Bottle and Pound, (as they call it) or be duck'd: They that don't pay, are fix'd to a Rope at the Main-Yard-Arm, and duck'd three Times in the Sea; at which the re&s;t of the Crew Huz|za! and fire a Volley of Small-&s;hot.</P>
<P>When Admiral <HI>Benbow</HI> went with his Squadron of Men of War, the whole Fleet duck'd, but the Admiral gave 'em Notice, by fir&s;t firing a Gun, which was immediately follow'd with a Volley of Muskets, and Huzzaing, by every Ship in the Fleet. A Day or two before our Account is out, we &s;end a Man to the Topma&s;t-head, in order to di&s;cover Land, where he &s;tays an Hour, and looks about him: He that di&s;covers it fir&s;t, is rewarded with a Bottle and Pound; that is, a Bottle of Rum, and a Pound of Sugar, which is demanded as &s;oon as the Anchor is ca&s;t in a Place where &s;uch Commodities are to be had. Now the Bottles and Pounds that accrue from the People that are not willing to be duck'd, in pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Tropick,</HI> are re|&s;erv'd
<PB N="13" REF="19">
by the old Sailors for a merry Bout, when &s;afe in Harbour; which mu&s;t not be touch'd by the fre&s;h Men, as they call 'em.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the 3d, our Man at the Topma&s;t-head, in&s;tead of crying, Land, (as we expected) call'd out, A Sail! a Sail! which in a quarter of an Hour we di&s;|cover'd plainly upon Deck. We did not know what to think of it, we knew we were near Land, and con&s;equently in fear of tho&s;e Pyrates, or Buccaniers, that infe&s;t tho&s;e Coa&s;ts: Our Captain call'd all Hands aloft; and told us, Gentlemen, 'Tis One to One, but this Ve&s;&s;el we &s;ee may be a Pyrate, if &s;o, how mu&s;t we behave our &s;elves? If you are re&s;olv'd to &s;tand it, I'll &s;tand it to the la&s;t; if not, we'll &s;urrender with|out firing a Gun, which may induce 'em to be civil to us. The Sailors cry'd, Let's fight 'em, let's fight 'em. With that, we put our Che&s;ts in the Hold, and brought up our Hammocks, to place 'em in the Netting on the Quarter-Deck; we clear'd our Guns, which were Twelve, and mu&s;ter'd our Men, which amounted to Thirty-eight, Pa&s;&s;engers and all, who were as willing to fight as any of us, they having &s;omething on Board that was valuable; and &s;ome of 'em, perhaps,
<PB N="14" REF="20">
all their Fortune. We kept our Way, and the Ship bore up to us, with all the Sail &s;he could make. Night coming upon us, our Man at the Topma&s;t-head di&s;cover'd Land, and another Ship to the Windward of us. With that, we call'd another Council, and per&s;i&s;ted in our fir&s;t Opinion of fighting; but yet to u&s;e all Means po&s;&s;ible of making to Shore, (which was <HI>Barbadoes:)</HI> But for all our Endeavours, the fir&s;t Ship got up with us, and about Twelve a Clock at Night hail'd us, and commanded us to hoi&s;t out our Boat, and come on Board him, with our Captain. We an&s;wer'd, We had never a Boat, (as indeed we had not) but we told him, if he would &s;tay till Morning, &s;omething might be done. At la&s;t he threatned to &s;ink us, if we wou'd not &s;end our Captain aboard im|mediately; and thereupon fir'd a Gun, which &s;truck our Ve&s;&s;el on her Quarter. With that, we fir'd our Broad-&s;ide upon him, accompany'd with &s;ome &s;mall Arms; which they little expecting, (I believe) did &s;ome Damage, and put 'em in Con|fu&s;ion. Whereupon we tack'd about, and with our other &s;ix Guns rak'd her fore and aft; but was immediately &s;econded with a Broad-&s;ide from them, which kill'd us two Men, and wounded a third.

Upon which, with loud Huzza's and Firing, they immediately boarded us on our Starboard-Quarter, and pour'd into us at lea&s;t four&s;core Men: We re&s;i&s;ted 'em with all the Force we had, but all to no purpo&s;e; they drove us into the Fore-ca&s;tle, where, by good Chance, we made &s;hift to barricade our &s;elves; but they threaten'd to turn our own Guns upon us, if we did not &s;urrender imme|diately: But our Captain being re&s;olute, order'd us to fire upon 'em with our &s;mall Arms. Now we had under the Greatings, clo&s;e to our Steerage, a large Ci&s;tern, lin'd with Tin, where we had unwittingly plac'd &s;everal Cartriges of Pow|der, but happily for us, whether it was our Firing, or in the Bu&s;tle &s;ome Match dropt in, I know not, but the Powder took fire, blew up the Greatings, with &s;ome part of the Quarter-Deck, and thir|ty of the Enemy, at lea&s;t, into the Air. Upon that, we &s;ally'd out, and drove the re&s;t, with our Cutla&s;hes, into their own Ve&s;&s;el again, with the lo&s;s of &s;everal. But this &s;ignify'd little, for with the Fall and Breach of our Quarter-Deck, the Pow|der-Room was entirely &s;topp'd up; nor cou'd we, without great Difficulty, clear it from the Lumber, &s;o that we had not any Powder, but what was in the Mens

Cartriges, for their Muskets: However, we fir'd briskly with 'em; yet neverthe|le&s;s they prepar'd to Board us again, with all the Menaces imaginable. This Fight continu'd at lea&s;t four Hours, and the Dawn began to break upon us, which di&s;cover'd to us the other Ship we &s;aw over Night, and we di&s;tingui&s;h'd <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours; with that we gave a great Shout, and fir'd our &s;mall Arms again. The E|nemy no &s;ooner &s;aw the Ship with <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Colours, but they cut off their Grap|pling-Irons, and did their Endeavour to make off, but their Rigging was &s;o &s;hat|ter'd, that their Sails cou'd not be hoi&s;ted. In the mean Time the other Ship came up to us, and, without hailing, pour'd a Broad-&s;ide into the Pyrate, and there fol|low'd a de&s;perate Fight between them. As for our Ship, it was of little U&s;e, &s;o we &s;teer'd off, and clear'd our Gun-Room, and in half an Hour (the Fight continu|ing all that while) we had charg'd our Great Guns, and return'd to the Fight; but upon the In&s;tant we &s;aw the Pyrate &s;inking, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship had tore a Hole between Wind and Water, that &s;he &s;unk in a Moment, and but eight Men &s;av'd, who told us their Captain was a Pyrate, from <HI>Guadalupe;</HI> that when they were &s;inking, they had not above twenty Men

left, out of an Hundred and &s;ixty; and mo&s;t of them wounded. The Ship that gave us this &s;ea&s;onable Re&s;cue was the <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI> Frigate, who&s;e Station was <HI>Bar|badoes.</HI> We lay by for an Hour or two, to repair our Rigging, &amp;c. and hail'd her, de&s;iring 'em to &s;end a Boat on Board for our Captain, becau&s;e we were without one; which accordingly they did. Captain <HI>Wa&s;e</HI> and I went immediately on Board, to pay our Re&s;pects to their Commander, who receiv'd us with all imaginable Ci|vility. We had, on Board our Ship, &s;e|ven Sailors, and two Pa&s;&s;engers, killd; the one, <HI>Jo&s;eph Ridge</HI> of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and the other, <HI>Daniel Thomp&s;on</HI> of <HI>Mevis,</HI> Merchant; and four wounded. The <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI> had &s;ixteen Men kill'd, and three wounded; among which was the Lieute|nant, who died the &s;ame Day of a Wound he received in his Thigh, with a Musket Ball chew'd, which made the Wound mortal. The Captain invited us to dine with him, which we did; where we were treated with a new Di&s;h, (at lea&s;t to me) a <HI>Pollo,</HI> that is, Fowls boil'd with Rice and &s;alt Pork; which was very pa|latable.

At the bottom of this Harbour, &s;tands the Capitol of the I&s;land, call'd St. <HI>Mi|chael</HI>'s; with a Fort at each End, and a Platform in the middle; which makes it of Strength &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e&punc;a Royal Navy: 'Tis a neat large Town, with two Churches, one with a hand&s;ome Organ: For Largene&s;s, I think this Town may compare with our City of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> but better inhabited.

Here I was fir&s;t &s;aluted with a little Fly, call'd a <HI>Mu&s;|keto,</HI> and tho' it is &s;mall, yet it has a devili&s;h &s;harp Sting with it. They get into our Stockings, and are &s;o very trou|ble&s;ome to new Comers, that there's hardly any bearing of 'em. If you &s;cratch the Places &s;tung by 'em till the Blood comes, it may prove dangerous; I my &s;elf kept a &s;ore Leg three Months upon that account. I was al&s;o inform'd there was a Flea they call <HI>Chigos,</HI> which breed in Du&s;t, or A&s;hes; and of all the In&s;ects in the <HI>Caribbees,</HI> this is the mo&s;t dangerous: They get into the Nails of the Toes im|perceptibly, and from thence run over all the Body; tho' they chiefly fix them&s;elves in the bottom of the Feet: Which occa|&s;ions an itching, follow'd with Holes in the Skin. They make Bli&s;ters as big as Peas in the Fle&s;h, where their young ones

breeding, cau&s;e Ulcers and rotten Fle&s;h, which there is no Remedy for, but to eat away the Parts affected, with <HI>Aqua-fortis</HI> and Burnt-Alum. While we lay here, there was a Sword Fi&s;h ran him&s;elf a&s;hore, (which was &s;uppos'd to be done in eager|ly cha&s;ing &s;ome other Fi&s;h:) It had no Scales, but a dusky Skin, and a white Bel|ly, rough like a Smith's File, a flat Head, two Fins on each &s;ide, two on the Back, and one in&s;tead of a Tail. It is a Fi&s;h of prodigious Swiftne&s;s: The Sword (which is fix'd in the Head) is &s;ix, &s;even, and &s;ome|times eight Foot long: Near his Eyes are two No&s;trils, out of which he throws the Water a great heighth into the Air. This Fi&s;h often encounters with the Whale, and proves too hard for him; for with his Sword he rips up the Whale. I bought one of the&s;e Swords of a poor Inhabitant, for four Bottles of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beer, (which is a great Rarity with them) that he got in a Piece of a Wreck, but thru&s;t in &s;o far, that the End, in getting out, was broke three Inches.</P>

This I&s;land is in|habited by both <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> who even in the Time of War live very friend|ly together. There was formerly di&s;co|ver'd a Silver Mine here, which the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> claim an equal Title to; but neither make any U&s;e of it, by rea&s;on of the want of Miners. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Li|berties are better peopled than the <HI>French,</HI> but the <HI>French</HI> have more Conveniencies, and better fortify'd Places than the <HI>Eng|li&s;h.</HI> An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fryar belonging to the <HI>French</HI> Je&s;uits, (who gave me this De|&s;cription) told me, that the <HI>French</HI> had built a Town, call'd, <HI>Ba&s;&s;e Terre</HI> (in a Harbour of the &s;ame Name, and chief in the I&s;land) full as big as <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> with very hand&s;ome Hou&s;es, for the Merchants, and Trades People, which are many; where there is al&s;o an Ho&s;pital to maintain their indigent &s;ick, together with a hand&s;ome Free-&s;chool, with large Endowments, for the Children of the I&s;land. But what they mo&s;tly brag of, is their Ca&s;tle, which is built about a Furlong from the Sea, at the Foot of a high Mountain, &s;hadow'd

with great Trees: In the Way thither, &s;tand the Hou&s;es of the Governour, and other Officers, for more Security; &s;eated in a Walk of Orange and Lemon Trees, from the Brow of the Sea up to the Ca&s;tle; which is three Story high, built with Free&s;tone and Brick: The Halls and Chambers are very light&s;ome and high, and the Walls are adorn'd with Cedar: On the Top is a flat Terrace, which yields a delightful Pro&s;pect all over the Country. The Winds which blow from the Hills, &s;o tempers the Heat, that it makes it more plea&s;ant than any other I&s;land of the <HI>Ca|ribbees.</HI> As to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, they are not much inferior to the <HI>French;</HI> they have &s;ix Churches, and two Chapels, for Divine Service. This I&s;land was plant|ed jointly by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> in 1625.

But whil&s;t this Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eem'd to go on with Succe&s;s, an

Accident happen'd, which ruin'd all at once. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;et out a Fleet the &s;ame Year, of thirty one Galloons, three Gallea&s;es, and four Pinnaces, with four thou&s;and Men, under the Command and Direction of <HI>Frederick de Toledo,</HI> from <HI>Cadiz, Antonio Nunnez Barrico,</HI> and <HI>Franci&s;co de Almeida,</HI> Commanders of twenty Galleys, from <HI>Portugal;</HI> the&s;e join|ed with the abovementioned, with a Re|&s;olution to drive the <HI>Engli&s;h, French,</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> entirely out of the <HI>American</HI> I&s;lands. Coming before <HI>Mevis,</HI> they took nine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els: After that they &s;ail'd to St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI> where Captain <HI>De&s;|nambuc</HI> (altho' not prepar'd for Defence, becau&s;e their Fortifications were not fi|ni&s;h'd) drew all his Forces near the Shore, to hinder their Landing: But Captain <HI>Ro&s;|&s;ey,</HI> who commanded another Port, &s;uf|fer'd 'em to land without the lea&s;t Re|&s;i&s;tance. Whereupon young <HI>De&s;nambuc,</HI> Lieutenant of a Company under <HI>Ro&s;&s;ey,</HI> &s;ally'd out, and fell valiantly on the fir&s;t Company of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> killing many of 'em, and put 'em to the Rout; but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being &s;econded by another Batta|lion, he was &s;lain, after having made a &s;tout Re&s;i&s;tance, and for&s;aken by all his Men. <HI>Ro&s;&s;ey,</HI> upon this, abandons his Intrench|ments, and flies to the Hills, and high

Grounds: Whereupon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> be|came Ma&s;ters of the Forts, but dur&s;t not follow <HI>Ro&s;&s;ey,</HI> for fear of an Ambu&s;cade; which Fear prov'd true: For <HI>De&s;nambuc</HI> un|dermining the Fort, retir'd on Board &s;ome Ve&s;&s;el, prepar'd for that Purpo&s;e, and made off. In the mean time, the Powder taking Fire, blew up the Fort, and &s;ix hundred <HI>Spaniards,</HI> into the Air. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> relying upon the League between <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> made no Re&s;i&s;tance, but &s;ent Agents to <HI>Toledo,</HI> &amp;c. to put him in mind of the League between their Ma&s;ters: To which he reply'd, That St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> being part of the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> World, was given by the Pope to his Ma&s;ter <HI>Philip.</HI> Neverthele&s;s he gave 'em &s;ix of the nine Ve&s;&s;els they took at <HI>Mevis,</HI> to imbark them&s;elves, on Condition they wou'd &s;ail immediately for <HI>England;</HI> which they a|greed to: But the &s;ix Ve&s;&s;els not holding all, the re&s;t were left on the I&s;land, for an|other Opportunity. No &s;ooner was <HI>To|ledo</HI> out of &s;ight, but the remaining part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Inhabitants took fre&s;h Cou|rage, and rebuilt &s;everal Forts, and made every thing ready for Defence, if Occa&s;ion &s;hou'd be. In the mean Time <HI>De&s;nam|buc</HI> &s;uffer'd a great deal of Hard&s;hip, thro' ill Weather, and want of Provi&s;ion; ha|ving been at &s;everal I&s;lands, intending to

&s;ettle, with his little Company, but not liking any of 'em, and hearing that the E|nemy were gone to the <HI>Havana,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were bu&s;y tilling their Grounds, he return'd to his former Station, where they &s;uffer'd many Hard&s;hips; till &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els from the <HI>Netherlands</HI> arriv'd, and fur|ni&s;h'd 'em with Provi&s;ions, Ammunition, and Cloaths, upon Credit: But in a few Years they paid all, and grew rich, from their plentiful Stock of Tobacco, Sugars, Ginger, and Indigo, till they brought it to the rich and flouri&s;hing State it now re|mains in.</P>
<P>Having ended our Affairs, we &s;et Sail for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the 21&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1699; and on the 7th of <HI>September,</HI> anchor'd &s;afe in <HI>Port Royal</HI> Harbour, in the great and flouri&s;hing I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> without any Accident.

<P>This I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica</HI> is the only Mart of all <HI>America</HI> for the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which drive a large Trade here; but Wic|kedne&s;s is in its full Perfection: I remem|ber Captain <HI>Wa&s;e</HI> ask'd one of our Men, that had &s;pent &s;ome Money a&s;hore, what was his Opinion of the Hone&s;ty of the Women of <HI>Port Royal?</HI> Why truly, &s;ays

<HI>Tarr</HI> very bluntly, if there's one hone&s;t Woman &s;hou'd happen to tumble down, I believe there's never another to take her up.

We had a Sai|lor on Board, that had been a Taylor by Trade; this Fellow got Leave of the Cap|tain to go on &s;hore for a Month, where he clear'd, by working Journey-Work, twelve Pound for that Month: But then he had the Ship's Provi&s;ion carry'd on &s;hore to him two or three times a Week; had he been to have paid for his Diet, he had &s;av'd but a &s;mall Matter. I was mightily &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee a Market for Turtle, in the &s;ame Manner as our Butchers. This is a Meat, or rather Fi&s;h, of an odd Nature, but of an excellent Ta&s;te; the Lean looks like the Fle&s;h of Pork, but &s;omething of a deeper red; the Fat is a &s;ort of a light green, but very lu&s;cious; this is the com|mon Diet of the Slaves, or meaner &s;ort of People; but if Strangers eat too much of it, it's apt to give 'em the Bloody-Flux. This is a very reigning Di&s;temper here,

The I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica</HI> lies&mdash;Leagues <HI>North</HI> from the <HI>Southern</HI> Continent of <HI>America,</HI> in the Sea call'd <HI>Mare del Nor;</HI> and <HI>South</HI> from the I&s;le of <HI>Cuba,</HI> about twelve Leagues; and twenty <HI>We&s;t</HI> from <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> in eighteen Degrees <HI>Northern</HI> Latitude; and beareth from <HI>Rio de Hach, North-We&s;t,</HI> a hundred and fifty Leagues; from <HI>Santa Martha, N.

Its Form is almo&s;t oval; being in Length, from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t,</HI> about fifty four Leagues; from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South,</HI> in the broade&s;t part, twenty three Leagues, going narrower toward each End, like a Rowling-Pin, (a good Compari&s;on.) In Circumference, one hundred and fifty Leagues. The Air of this I&s;land is more temperate, and the Heat more tolerable, than any of the other I&s;lands, by rea&s;on of the cool Breezes which con&s;tantly blow from the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> with frequent Showers of Rain, and Dews that fall in the Night. The&s;e Dews are very pernicious to carele&s;s drunken People, that lie expos'd all Night to 'em. This

is al&s;o the only I&s;le of the <HI>Barloventi,</HI> which is not &s;ubject to violent Storms, and Hurricanes, as the other I&s;lands are. And the Di&s;ea&s;es that are predominant here, are only bred by Intemperance; as Surfeits, Bloody-flux, Fevers, and Agues; or occa&s;ion'd by ill Diet, or Slothfulne&s;s. This I&s;land is well water'd with Springs and Rivulets of fre&s;h Water, (with many hand&s;ome Rivers &s;tor'd with &s;everal &s;orts of Fi&s;h;) and is all over (e&s;pecially in the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Parts) full of high Mountains and Hills: It is al&s;o well wooded; for the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South</HI> Parts chiefly abound with large and tall Woods. Neither is there wanting Savanna's, or Plains. The Com|modities of this I&s;land are very many; and fir&s;t, for Vegetables; the Sugars are &s;o good, that they now out &s;ell tho&s;e of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> 5 <HI>s. per Cent.</HI> Tobacco is &s;o excellent, that it is bought up fa&s;ter than the Planters can cure it: The Indigo is al|&s;o here very good: The Cotton is much the be&s;t of all the neighbouring I&s;lands: Tortoi&s;e-&s;hell is very plenty here. Here are al&s;o great Variety of Dyewood, as <HI>Fu&s;t-wick, Red-wood,</HI> a kind of <HI>Log-wood, Cedar, Mohogeny, Lignum-vitae, Ebony, Granadille,</HI> and many others. Nay, there's many Mines, both of Silver, Copper, and Gold; but that the Inhabitants think it

wou'd be dangerous to break 'em up, for fear of drawing the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Buccaniers upon 'em. There are &s;everal Fi&s;hermen who have found pieces of Am|bergrea&s;e upon the Surface of the Water, near the Shore. Ginger grows better here than in any other Part of <HI>America;</HI> and Cod-Pepper very plentifully: And al&s;o, a certain Kind of Spice call'd, <HI>Piemete,</HI> in Form of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Pepper, of a very aro|matical and curious Ta&s;te, partaking, as it were, of &s;everal Species together: It grows wild among the Mountains, and is highly valu'd among the Inhabitants.

The ingenious Sir <HI>Hans Sloan</HI> has wrote an elaborate Book of the Plants of this I&s;land. <HI>Co|chineal</HI> is produc'd by a Plant that grows in this Country, but not brought to Per|fection, without much Care and Indu&s;try. This I&s;land is al&s;o very well &s;tock'd with Cat|tle, as Hor&s;es, Cows, and A&s;&s;es; there have been many Mules, but the Inhabitants made &s;o little U&s;e of 'em, that now there are but few. Sheep are large and tall, and their Meat indifferently good, but their

Fleece worth nothing. <HI>Goats</HI> (or <HI>Cabi|rates)</HI> are without Number, being a Bea&s;t peculiar to the Country. Hogs, both wild and tame, in abundance. I have been hunting the wild Hog in <HI>Porta Morant</HI> Bay, and it gives good Diver&s;ion, though &s;ometimes dangerous: You go with &s;ome Ten or a Dozen in Company, arm'd with a Musket and a Cutla&s;h; as &s;oon as ever (with your Dogs) you have found 'em out, you all take Aim, and fire as quick as you can; but if you don't kill 'em immediate|ly with your Shot, they &s;et upon you open-mouth'd, &s;o that you mu&s;t either hew 'em down with your Cutla&s;hes, or club your Muskets. Generally as &s;oon as you have 'em, you flay 'em, as you do Mut|ton, and <HI>barbicue</HI> 'em, even in the very Place where you kill 'em; that is, you dig a &s;quare Hole in the Earth, then clap four Stakes at each Corner, and on 'em put your Meat, &s;o make a Fire under it, and when one &s;ide is done enough, you turn the other. For tame Fowls, they have of all the Kinds that we have in <HI>England;</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Guinea</HI> Hens, <HI>Parrots, Parachites, Machaws,</HI> and <HI>Boobies,</HI> (which are <HI>Boobies</HI> indeed, for they will &s;it upon a Tree, or Po&s;t, till you come and take 'em.) They have three Crops a Year, in this I&s;land, and the Trees are always green. They
<PB N="32" REF="38">
have three &s;orts of Bread, one of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Corn, another of <HI>Guinea</HI> Wheat, and the third of a Root they call Ca&s;avi, which is rank Poi&s;on, till pre&s;s'd and bak'd in an Oven; 'tis very white, but ta&s;tele&s;s, and the Bread made of it, the Size of our thin Oat-Cakes. But of all the Fruit this I&s;land produces, the Pine-Apple is the be&s;t, which grows very low, with Leaves &s;omething like the <HI>Indicus Ficus</HI> that I have &s;een in Gardens here in <HI>England;</HI> the Ta&s;te is &s;o excellent, that I know not what to com|pare it to, it having the Reli&s;h of all fine|flavour'd Fruits. There's a Fruit that grows upon a low Bu&s;h, call'd the Prickle-Pear, the in&s;ide of which is red, and on the top is a little thorny Thing like a Star, which if you do not take away, before you eat it, may prove pernicious. If you eat but two of this Fruit, it will make your Urine as red as Blood. <HI>Plantins</HI> are a very good Fruit, which is, when bak'd in the A&s;hes, us'd by the Slaves in&s;tead of Bread: 'Tis a Fruit with a Skin on it, like our Beans, which is taken off, and then the Fruit ap|pears, about the &s;ize of a <HI>Bolognia</HI> Sau&s;age. <HI>Bannanas</HI> is another Fruit &s;omething of the &s;ame Kind, but &s;horter, and more lu&s;cious: Both the&s;e Fruits are ripe all the Year, for when &s;ome are fit to gather, others are green, and &s;ome in Bud. The Oranges
<PB N="33" REF="39">
and Lemons, are neither of 'em good, in my Opinion: but their Limes are wonder|ful, they grow upon a Tree full of Thorns, where you mu&s;t be &s;ure to prick your Fingers, if you'll gather 'em. The&s;e, with Spring-Water and Sugar, was the chief of my Liquor, while we &s;taid there. The Potatoes are very fine here, exceeding, in my Opinion, even tho&s;e of <HI>Ireland.</HI> Then there's another Root call'd Jams, &s;ome|thing like a <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>-Artichoak, but larger and &s;tringy. The Onions of <HI>Ja|maica,</HI> are much milder, and better ta&s;ted than our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Onions, and very whol|&s;ome: They us'd to make a great Addi|tion to our Crogick Brewis; that is, Bisket &s;oak'd in fair Water, for &s;ome Time, then the Water thrown away, and the Bisket &s;trew'd over with Salt, Oil, and Lime-Juice, together with Onions; and &s;o eaten as a dainty Di&s;h. There is a &s;en&s;itive Plant in this I&s;land; the Stalk, &s;urrounded with Leaves full of dark red Spots, bears a &s;weet-&s;melling violet-colour'd Flower; the Leaves, as &s;oon as touch'd, clo&s;e up toge|ther, and die; and accordingly as they are held in the Hand a &s;horter or a longer Time, this Alteration continues. Ginger grows plentiful here; the Male Plant (for there's Sexes) hath generally bigger Leaves than the Female: The Stalks, which are
<PB N="34" REF="40">
without Knots, have more Leaves upwards than downwards, and &s;preads along the Earth, &s;till taking Root anew. When the Leaves wither, then the Ginger is com|monly ripe, but it has not that Poinancy whil&s;t green, as when dry'd. The Cotton of this Place (of which the Cloaths and Hammocks are made, are vended in mo&s;t Parts of the <HI>We&s;teru</HI> World) grows on a Tree about the Heighth of a Peach-Tree, with a &s;trait Stem, or Body, out of which &s;hoot Boughs of an equal Length, and at equal Di&s;tance: Between the Leaves, which are narrow and long, grow red Flowers, and from 'em, oval Cods, which, when ripe, inclo&s;e the Cotton, and a Seed like Pepper. Of hurtful Creatures, there is the Crocodile, or <HI>Alligator,</HI> which infe&s;t many Rivers and Ponds; this is a Creature of a mon&s;trous Size; I have &s;een one twenty &s;ix Foot long; it moves &s;wiftly and &s;trongly forward, but turns &s;low; they are impe|netrable every where but in the Eye, or Belly; they have four Feet, or Fins, with which they go, or &s;wim; their u&s;ual Cour&s;e of getting their Food is to lie on their Backs as dead, then with a &s;udden On&s;et they &s;pring upon their Prey, whether Man or Bea&s;t: But 'tis ea&s;ily avoided by a Man, by rea&s;on of an Aromatick Smell that comes from the Body, which may be &s;melt
<PB N="35" REF="41">
five Hundred Yards; but if a Man has got a Cold, and can't &s;mell, if he has Eyes they are ea&s;ily avoided; for if they run right forward, it is but &s;lipping on one &s;ide, for they are as long in turning as a Coach. The Oil that's made from the&s;e Creatures, is good for &s;everal Di&s;tempers. They lay their Eggs (about the &s;ize of a Turkey's) and cover 'em with Sand, which heated by the Beams of the Sun, hatches the young ones, who naturally creep into the Water. One of the&s;e Creatures &s;wam after us fifty Yards in <HI>Porto Morant</HI> Bay, and rais'd his Head upon the Edge of our Long-Boat, which was deeply laden with Casks of Water; our Carpenter, who had been fel|ling of Timber to Wood the Ship, &s;truck him a very great Blow on the No&s;e with his Hatchet, that I am &s;ure hurt him, for he gave a &s;ort of Shriek, which no Body ever heard before, and &s;wam to &s;hore; where I ob&s;erv'd him to run his Head into the Mud, as if it pain'd him, which makes me think that their Heads are not invulne|rable, as is reported. The <HI>Guana</HI> is ano|ther Creature amphibious as the <HI>Alligator,</HI> but nothing nigh &s;o large: There's an I&s;land near <HI>Jamaica,</HI> call'd <HI>Guana</HI> I&s;land, inhabited by nothing el&s;e; our Seamen eat of the&s;e latter, but much Good may it do 'em, for the Fle&s;h looks like a piece of a

<HI>Black-a-more</HI>'s Arm; but how it ta&s;tes I can't tell, neither do I ever de&s;ign to try. The <HI>Cocoa</HI> Nut is a Fruit that is both Meat, Drink, and Cloathing to the Natives, (I mean the Blacks) the Rind &s;erves for wea|ving of Cloaths, nay, and rigging their Canoes, before they knew the <HI>Europeans;</HI> and when you have taken off the Bark, you mu&s;t be beholding to a Saw to cut off the Monkey's Face, which is the top, with three Marks that makes it &s;omething re&s;emble that Animal; then the In&s;ide con|tains, fir&s;t a liquid Sub&s;tance, like Whey, but very &s;weet; after you have taken out this Liquor, round the Nut is a Sub&s;tance a quarter of an Inch thick, which you cut out, and that's the Meat, which is very delicious and grateful to the Ta&s;te, but not whol&s;ome, if eat of too much: There's another Thing that's very remarkable, and that is the <HI>Phi&s;ick-Nut,</HI> much of the Ta&s;te of our Pig-nuts, but one or two of 'em will do your Bu&s;ine&s;s, upwards or down|wards, as well as Dr. <HI>Annodyne-Necklace</HI>'s Sugar-Plumbs. As I was going one Day to dine with Captain <HI>Kendal,</HI> (a Gentle|man Inhabitant within a Mile of the Bay in <HI>Porto Morant)</HI> attended by a Black, a Servant of his, I &s;aw in the Hedge a fair Apple growing on a Bu&s;h, which I readi|ly gather'd, and was conveying to my
<PB N="37" REF="43">
Mouth, but prevented by the Black's giving me a Blow on the Hand, which &s;truck it from me; I immediately, with my Sword in the Scabbard, fell to belabour the poor Fellow for his In&s;olence, for I having been familiar with him, and talk'd to him along the Road, thought he made our old <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Proverb true, <HI>If you give an Inch they'll take an Ell;</HI> but it &s;eems the Fellow &s;av'd my Life by it, for this Fruit, which was call'd a <HI>Mangineel Apple,</HI> was rank Poy|&s;on, but what I had never &s;een or heard of before; I was &s;o concern'd for the Blows I had given the poor Fellow, that I gave him a Dollar to make him amends. I remember I was afterwards wa&s;hing my &s;elf at a River, in the &s;ame Bay, and it raining very hard, I went under a Tree, to &s;ave my Cloaths from being wet, and in placing them together in a Cavity of the Shore, the Drops of Rain fell on a <HI>Man|gineel</HI> Tree, and &s;o on my Back, but in le&s;s than half an Hour my Fle&s;h burn'd very hot, and white Bli&s;ters appear'd upon my Skin, in&s;omuch that I was in a high Fever; but a Native of the Place being with me, ran for &s;alt Water, and wa&s;h'd me all over, and afterwards got &s;ome Oil and dip'd my Shirt in it, and put it on my Back, which gave me Ea&s;e immediately; but the Spots remain'd upon my Skin &s;everal Years after|wards.

I don't doubt but my Readers will laugh at me for thus running from one Thing to another, but I relate 'em ju&s;t as my Memory prompts me. This I&s;land was fir&s;t di&s;cover'd by <HI>Columbus, Anno Dom.</HI> 1499. After he had conquer'd the Natives, and built a City, call'd <HI>Sevilla,</HI> (afterwards <HI>St. Jago de la Vega)</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of about &s;eventeen Hundred Hou&s;es, two Churches, two Chapels, and an Abbey, he made his Son <HI>Diego Columbus</HI> Governor of the whole I&s;land, for his Ma&s;ter <HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Spain.</HI> The fir&s;t Attempt made upon this I&s;land by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> was <HI>A. D.</HI> 1592, under the Command of Mr. <HI>Antony Shir|ley,</HI> but after vanqui&s;hing the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they de&s;erted it, as not thinking it worth their keeping, and return'd home. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> again po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, remain'd un|mole&s;ted, till <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1654, when <HI>O|liver Cromwel,</HI> then Lord Protector, rigg'd out a Fleet of Ships to make a De&s;cent on <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> under the Command of Colonel <HI>Venables;</HI> but being di&s;appointed of their Hopes, and meeting with ill Suc|ce&s;s, &s;teer'd away for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and on the 10th of <HI>May</HI> (after a &s;tout Re&s;i&s;tance) made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it. The I&s;land is &s;uppos'd to contain two hundred and fifty thou&s;and Inhabitants, Slaves included. The chief Towns are, 1&s;t, <HI>St. Jago,</HI> about
<PB N="39" REF="45">
&s;ix Miles up the Country. 2<HI>dly, Pa&s;&s;age-Town,</HI> &s;ix Miles from that. 3<HI>dly,</HI> (And in|deed the large&s;t, before the Earthquake de|&s;troy'd it) <HI>Port Royal,</HI> it contained a thou|&s;and Hou&s;es, many of them eminent Build|ings; but as it is now built on a &s;mall Neck of Land, which forms the Harbour, I take it to be about the bigne&s;s of <HI>Dept|ford.</HI> At both Ends of the Town is a large Fort, known by the Name of the &s;quare and round Fort: the &s;quare Fort, or Ca&s;tle, contains a hundred Pieces of Ordnance, and the other about thirty, be&s;ides &s;everal Canon on the Platform, which reaches from one Fort to the other; &s;o that, with|out Treachery, they need not fear an At|tack either by Land or Sea. About a Mile farther, is another &s;mall Fort, call'd <HI>Land|ward</HI> Fort, which &s;ecures the Town from any Attempt by Land: Off the Mouth of the Harbour, towards the Sea, lie &s;everal &s;mall I&s;lands, upon the mo&s;t <HI>We&s;tern</HI> of which (lying within half a League of the Town, and by which all the Ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t pa&s;s) they have erected a Fort which con|tains eight Guns. The chief Harbour, af|ter <HI>Port Royal,</HI> is <HI>Port St. Antony,</HI> on the <HI>North;</HI> a very &s;afe, commodious, land|lock'd Harbour, only the coming in is &s;ome|thing difficult, the Channel being narrow'd by a little I&s;land that lies off the Mouth of

the Port. 2<HI>d, Portomorant,</HI> a very capa|cious Harbour, where Ships do convenient|ly Wood and Water, and ride &s;afe from all Winds. 3<HI>d,</HI> On the <HI>South</HI> is <HI>Port Gag|way,</HI> which is much the large&s;t of all that has been mention'd, it being five Leagues over, in &s;ome Places; it is land-lock'd by a Point of Land that runs <HI>S. W.</HI> from the main of the I&s;land: The Road is &s;o deep that a Ship of a thou&s;and Tun may lay her Side to the Shore of the Point, and lade or unlade at Plea&s;ure, with Planks a|float.</P>
<P>Now finding our Affairs wou'd detain us half a Year longer, I got Leave of the Captain to go in a Sloop, with &s;ome of my Acquaintance, to get Logwood, and on <HI>September</HI> the 25th we &s;et &s;ail for the Bay of <HI>Campeche,</HI> with a fair Wind. The old Manner of getting this Wood is as fol|lows; a Company of de&s;perate Fellows get together in a Sloop, well arm'd, and Land by &s;tealth, but in Ca&s;e of any Re&s;i&s;tance, the whole Crew attends on the Cutters, ready arm'd to defend 'em; (indeed there's a Colony of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that &s;ells this Log|wood, but many chu&s;e the other Way; all this was &s;trange to me, for I knew nothing of the matter, till we were out to Sea. There was one Fellow there that told me, that about ten Years before he went with a
<PB N="41" REF="47">
Ve&s;&s;el, and they took the &s;ame Method as u&s;ual, in getting it, and landed all their Men but &s;ix, that they left on Board to look after the Ve&s;&s;el; in the mean time the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having Intelligence of their De&s;cent, &s;ent a hundred Men, in &s;everal Canoes, to &s;eize their Ve&s;&s;el; which ac|cordingly they did, without any Re&s;i&s;tance from the &s;ix Men on Board: After they had clap'd the&s;e Men under Hatches, they &s;earch'd and ran&s;ack'd the Ve&s;&s;el, &s;ending every thing on &s;hore that was of any Va|lue; then they prepar'd to trepan the Crew, as they came on board, which happen'd the very next Night, when &s;ome of the Men coming on board with a Load of Log|wood, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> caus'd the &s;ix Men to &s;tand upon Deck, and on Pain of Death, not to di&s;cover the Truth of the Matter, which happen'd as they de&s;ir'd, for the Men coming on Board carele&s;ly without their Arms, were all &s;eiz'd immediately, and clapp'd in Irons. The re&s;t that were on &s;hore wondering at the &s;tay of the Boat, &s;ent a Canoe with &s;ix Men, to know the Rea&s;on of their Delay, which were like|wi&s;e taken in the &s;ame Trap with the for|mer. The Man that told me this Story, was one of the&s;e la&s;t &s;ix, who found means &s;ecretly in the middle of the Night to &s;lip into the Water, and &s;wam a&s;hore, tho' a
<PB N="42" REF="48">
League off, where he happily inform'd the re&s;t of the Crew (which were forty three) of the Misfortune that had happen'd to their Companions: Whereupon they con|&s;ulted what they had be&s;t do; where it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, to &s;eize upon three large Canoes, that lay at the bottom of the Bay, that belong'd to &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Hunters that were on &s;hore; which was done accordingly: On Board they imme|diately got, well arm'd, and &s;teer'd away for their Sloop: But as they de&s;ign'd to trick them the &s;ame way as the others had done their Companions, they con|&s;ulted what to do if they &s;hould be di&s;co|ver'd before they could get on Board, which was probable enough. At length it was agreed to carry on the Plot in order to de|ceive them, and as &s;oon as ever they could get over the Ship's &s;ide to a&s;&s;ault the Ene|my with all the Vigour imaginable, ap|pointing two or three to relea&s;e their Com|panions, and put Arms into their Hands, to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant in recovering their Liberties. Every thing happen'd as was &s;ugge&s;ted, for when they came within half a Fur|long of the Ve&s;&s;el, they were hail'd by &s;ome of their own Men, as it is u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es; which was an&s;wer'd by them in the Canoes, with &s;wearing and cur&s;ing at 'em, for not coming a&s;hore with their Long|boat,
<PB N="43" REF="49">
as order'd, but to force 'em to bring their Wood aboard in Canoes. They ask'd from on Board, how many were come with 'em? All (an&s;wer'd they in the Boat) but three, that we left a&s;hore to look af|ter our Arms, and a &s;mall Remainder of Log-wood, which you mu&s;t go and fetch immediately with the Long-boat, (which they pretended cou'd not go to 'em before, by rea&s;on &s;he had a Hole broke in her Bow, again&s;t a piece of Rock, that gave 'em a great deal of Trouble in getting her to the Ve&s;&s;el.) Our People &s;mil'd to them|&s;elves to hear they had got their Le&s;&s;on &s;o ready. In asking and an&s;wering the&s;e Que&s;tions, they had reach'd the Ve&s;&s;el, and getting nimbly up the Side, they drew from under their Watch-Coats, their Pi&s;tols and Cutla&s;hes, and fir&s;t fir'd upon the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> who were running to &s;eize 'em, half unarm'd, as not &s;u&s;pecting any Re&s;i&s;tance: Tho&s;e who&s;e Office it was to relea&s;e the Pri&s;oners under Hatches, did it immediate|ly, by killing the two Centuries that watch'd over 'em; and then coming up with this fre&s;h Recruit &s;oon overcame the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and made 'em call for Quarter: Which was not granted till they had thrown down their Arms. When they had &s;urrender'd, they chain'd 'em all under Hatches; and &s;o the Conquerors became Pri&s;oners, and the
<PB N="44" REF="50">
Pri&s;oners Conquerors. After the Action was over, they look'd after the Dead, which was found to be nine <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and one <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> who was &s;uppos'd to be kill'd by our own Men, in the fir&s;t Fire.</P>
<P>Upon this good Succe&s;s, they having no|tice that there lay a rich Ship in the Har|bour before the Town of <HI>Campeche,</HI> they re&s;olv'd to try their good Fortune farther, which they contriv'd as follows: they hoi&s;ted <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colours, and &s;ail'd away immedi|ately for the Port of <HI>Campeche,</HI> where they arriv'd by next Morning, &s;aluted the Ca&s;tle and Town with &s;even Guns, as Friends, and were paid back the Complement. The Shore was fill'd with Numbers of People, to &s;ee the <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> brought a&s;hore Pri|&s;oners; but they were mi&s;taken. The Ship which they had a De&s;ign upon lay about a League from the Town, as having ar|riv'd but two Days before, but was to put farther in that very Evening, before the Sea Breeze fail'd; our Men boarded her on the Starboard-&s;ide, which lay from the Town, and took her, without firing a Gun; cut her Cables, and made out to Sea, before the Town knew what was the matter: But as &s;oon as ever they &s;melt the Trick, a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of War of thirty Guns (being all that was in the Harbour) &s;lip'd her Cables, and crouded all the Sail
<PB N="45" REF="51">
&s;he cou'd, to come up with us; we finding &s;he gain'd upon us, call'd a Council, and at la&s;t re&s;olv'd to bring up mo&s;t of our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners bound, and expo&s;e 'em to the whole Fire of the Enemy. Which &s;ucceeded accordingly, for the Ship coming clo&s;e up to us, (without any firing on ei|ther &s;ide) commanded us to &s;trike. Upon that we order'd the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain to lay before 'em their Condition; which profited little at fir&s;t, but after many In|treaties from them, and Threatnings from us, the others were prevail'd upon to &s;heer off, and make towards the Town, while we made the be&s;t of our Way. But the <HI>Spaniard</HI> making up to the Town again, was met by &s;everal armed Boats, with the Governor him&s;elf in one of them, who gave a &s;trict Command not to regard any Thing, but u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Means to re|take the Ship, and the Pyrates (as they term'd us.) When we perceiv'd the Boats making up to the Ship, and ob&s;erv'd her tack about to give us Cha&s;e, we gue&s;s'd at the Matter, and finding &s;he gain'd upon us, we put our &s;elves into a Po&s;ture of De|fence, and propos'd to engage her in the Prize we took la&s;t, which carry'd twenty Guns: We mu&s;ter'd our Men, and found we had &s;eventy one; but then we had two hundred <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners, who, we
<PB N="46" REF="52">
fear'd, if by any Accident they &s;hou'd get loo&s;e, might prove our Ruin; whereupon a Con&s;ult was immediately held to put mo&s;t of them to Death. Upon which the Captain of the fir&s;t Prize &s;tood up, and &s;aid, (in pretty good <HI>Engli&s;h)</HI> Gentle|men, you have taken us fairly, and done no more than we our &s;elves did to you; now &s;eeing that Ship which pur&s;ues us, and gains upon us every Moment, is coming in order to fight you, we &s;hall run a more certain Danger by it, by being your Pri&s;o|ners, if you expo&s;e us to the Fire of their Canon, as you did before; and if they do really fire, I may as well take them for an Enemy, as you, &s;ince we are &s;ure to receive the mo&s;t Damage. But to make the Matter &s;hort, being the Time is &s;o, I propo&s;e to you, that if the Ve&s;&s;el fires at you, we may rea&s;onably conclude, they have no manner of Regard for us, &s;o we &s;hall not have any for them, and, if you'll give us that Liberty, we will freely fight under your Command, and endeavour, as far as in us lies, to defend your Ve&s;&s;el, as much as if it was our own. This Speech of the Captain's was approv'd of by the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners; &s;o that at la&s;t we a|greed to &s;et &s;ixty of them at Liberty, and the re&s;t fa&s;t bound under Hatches, where we put two Centuries, with two Patareroes
<PB N="47" REF="53">
fix'd, charg'd with &s;mall Shot, with Orders, that if there &s;eem'd to be any thing like Di&s;turbance, to fire in upon 'em. The &s;ixty we cho&s;e out to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to us, were order'd to the Great Guns, &s;o that we &s;till had the Command over 'em, be|cau&s;e they had no Arms. After we had &s;ettled every thing, we lay by, (&s;eeing it impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape without fighting) in order for their coming up to us, which they did in a &s;hort time, and coming within Hail, they order'd us to &s;trike immediately, and make no Re&s;i&s;tance, or el&s;e they wou'd have no Regard to their Friends on Board us, but &s;ink or take us, and put every Man of us to Death. Upon which the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain that was our Pri&s;oner, made An&s;wer. That if they offer'd to fire a Gun, every <HI>Spaniard</HI> on Board us re&s;olv'd to fight again&s;t 'em as Enemies. Which was an&s;wer'd, They mu&s;t obey the Gover|nor's Orders, who had ju&s;t left 'em, and was return'd on &s;hore. Upon this they fir'd a Broad&s;ide upon us, but we re|turn'd it immediately with our &s;mall Arms, and great Guns, which were well ply'd by our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners. The Fight conti|nu'd half an Hour with all the Fiercene&s;s imaginable; at la&s;t the <HI>Spaniard</HI> prepar'd to board us with his Boats at the &s;ame Time, but were receiv'd &s;o briskly, and &s;o da|mag'd

by our Hand-Granado's, that they were oblig'd to make to the Ship with great Lo&s;s. The Hand-Granado's &s;tood us in great &s;tead, for we di&s;patch'd three or four of our Men into the Main-Top, who from thence di&s;charg'd &s;everal Granado's, that by their own Report kill'd and wound|ed above thirty Men. They attempted to board us once again, and came on briskly with firing and loud Shouts, to terrify us; but we return'd 'em their Shouts and firing with Intere&s;t, for with a lucky Shot we drove away their Main-Ma&s;t, which put 'em into &s;trange Confu&s;ion: This Accident (if we would have laid hold on't) might have given us an Opportunity of out-&s;ailing 'em; but that was not once thought of, for De&s;ire of Revenge made us fight like Furies. The next Broad-&s;ide we gave 'em, &s;truck away their Rudder, which render'd 'em incapable of &s;teering their Ve&s;&s;el, or tacking about: Upon which we perceiving what had happen'd, tack'd about, and with a Broad-&s;ide that rack'd her fore and aft, kill'd 'em, by their own Confe&s;&s;ion, &s;ix|teen Men, for it &s;plit two of their Guns, who&s;e Splinters did mo&s;t of the Execution. Now what we call to <HI>rake fore and aft,</HI> is to lay the Side of our Ship again&s;t the Enemy's Head or Stern, and fire into 'em, &s;o that every Shot goes from one End of
<PB N="49" REF="55">
the Ship to the other, in&s;tead of going a|cro&s;s, &s;o that of Con&s;equence one Shot that way will do more Damage than ten directly &s;ide to &s;ide. The Heat of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> now began to abate, but yet he hector'd as much as ever; at la&s;t a lucky Shot enter'd her Powder-Room, and blew up her main Deck, with &s;everal <HI>Spaniards,</HI> into the Air; upon which was heard &s;uch Groans and Yelling, from wounded and dying Men, that were enough to frighten Men le&s;s inur'd to &s;uch Encounters: With this Succe&s;s we prepar'd, in the Confu&s;ion, to board them in our turn, but was pre|vented, by &s;eeing their Ve&s;&s;el &s;inking; whereupon they &s;truck down their Colours, and ask'd for Quarter, and Help; which we immediately gave 'em, by putting out our Boats, which together with their own, &s;av'd all the Men they had left, which were ninety five, out of four hundred and odd.</P>
<P>This Succe&s;s flu&s;h'd us mightily with Hopes of &s;ucceeding in any Enterprize. We lo&s;t out of our <HI>Spaniards</HI> twenty &s;ix, and of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nine kill'd, and two wounded, who dy'd the next Day. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were of &s;ignal Service to us, and fought bravely, even to De&s;paration; well know|ing, if they &s;hou'd be taken (after fighting
<PB N="50" REF="56">
on our &s;ide) they mu&s;t all inevitably &s;uffer Death: Which prov'd happy for us; for it had been impo&s;&s;ible for us to have e&s;cap'd 'em, even if all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on Board us had &s;tood neuter.</P>
<P>After we had clear'd our Ve&s;&s;el of the Blood and dead Men, and refre&s;h'd our &s;elves, we call'd up our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners, that they might refre&s;h them&s;elves likewi&s;e, and return'd the others (who had fought &s;o bravely in our Defence) our hearty Thanks; and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain expre&s;s'd him&s;elf &s;o hand&s;omly, that our Ma&s;ter freely offer'd him our Sloop, victual'd and ready fitted up, to do what he thought fit with. Upon this kind Offer the Captain &s;mil'd, and told him he would not take it without buying: And as for Money, I have none, (pur&s;ued he) but if you'll li&s;ten to a Stra|tagem of mine, I'll engage to furni&s;h you with Money for your Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;ome|thing over and above. With that he pro|pos'd to take &s;ix of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that had fought for us, and in our Long-Boat to go on &s;hore to the Governor, and demand a Ran&s;om for the Pri&s;oners we had taken; which was agreed to: accordingly they went a&s;hore, and told the Governor, if he did not immediately &s;end fifty Dollars a Man, for two hundred and twenty, they wou'd be eve|ry

Soul ty'd Back to Back, and thrown in|to the Sea. Upon which there was a Ga|thering made through the Town, and the Money rais'd immediately, and in twelve Hours the Captain return'd with 11000 Dollars, gave our Captain 5000, di&s;tributed 3000 among the Sailors, and kept the re&s;t for him&s;elf. The next Day we &s;et the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that were &s;av'd from the Man of War on &s;hore, and as many more that were willing, out of the other Ship, and of our own Sloop; &s;o that Captain <HI>Fer|nando,</HI> our friendly <HI>Spaniard,</HI> took his leave of us, with eighty of his Countrymen with Intention for the <HI>South</HI> Sea; and we &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e, in our rich Prize, for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where we &s;har'd it: Every common Sailor had to his Share 800<HI>l.</HI> Moreover the Cap|tain order'd me in particular, 200<HI>l.</HI> more, for the Service I did in &s;wimming a&s;hore unperceiv'd, to give 'em Notice.</P>
<P>After ending his Story, I ask'd him how he had improv'd his Money from that Time? P&s;ha! (&s;ays he) that, and five times as much, is gone &s;ince then.

that &s;teals out of his lurking-place, when the blu&s;tering Bailiffs are gone out of &s;ight. About &s;ix in the Evening, we &s;aw a Water-Spout: This is an Aerial Engine, or Lim|beck, that draws up the &s;alt Water of the Sea, and di&s;tils it into fre&s;h Showers of Rain: This Cloud comes down in Form of a Pipe of Lead of a va&s;t Thickne&s;s, and by the Force of the Sun &s;ucks up a great Quantity of Water. I &s;tood an Hour to ob&s;erve it; after it had continu'd about half an Hour in the Water, it drew up in|&s;en&s;ibly, by Degrees, till it was lo&s;t in the Clouds; but in the clo&s;ing of the &s;ame, it &s;hut out &s;ome of the Water, which fell into the Sea again, with a Noi&s;e like that of Thunder, and occa&s;ion'd a Smoke in the Water, that la&s;ted for a con&s;iderable Time. The Sailors told me, that the&s;e Water-Spouts &s;ometimes did great Damage to Ships that by Calms were too near 'em when they fell. One Fellow told me, that he &s;aw a Bark of &s;ixty Tun &s;uck'd out of the Water by one of 'em, which caus'd the breaking of the Spout, and &s;unk the Ve&s;&s;el with the Fall of the Waters. In the <HI>Streights,</HI> when Ships approach the&s;e airy Engines, they fire off a Gun, and that breaks 'em before they come too near. The Per&s;on told me, that at the Fall of Water, the Sea was curl'd as

much as if you had thrown a large Stone into a &s;tanding Pond of Water. We have &s;ometimes at a Di&s;tance &s;een fourteen or fifteen at a Time at Work, but I never &s;aw one &s;o large as this.</P>
<P>In the Evening we caught a &s;mall Shark, with two &s;ucking Fi&s;hes that &s;tuck clo&s;e to her till laid on the Deck, and then drop'd down of their own Accord. This is al|low'd the <HI>Remora</HI> of the Ancients: It is about the Bigne&s;s of a Mackrel, with a flat Head, and is of a gri&s;tly Sub&s;tance.

I have &s;ometimes &s;een the&s;e Fi&s;hes &s;ticking to a Log of Wood, in the Water. When we hog'd our Ship, (a Hog is an In&s;trument of &s;ix Foot &s;quare, &s;omething like a Harrow, and Stumps of old Brooms fix'd clo&s;e in the middle part) this is put to the bottom of the Ship, with a Rope before and another aft, fix'd to the Cap&s;torn, which cleans the Ve&s;&s;el from all &s;orts of Filth.

<P>Now in getting up to <HI>Jamaica</HI> again, generally takes us up two Months, becau&s;e we are oblig'd to ply it all the way to Windward. One Day it being &s;tark calm, I went into the Water to wa&s;h my &s;elf, though I was di&s;&s;uaded by all the Sailors, by rea&s;on of that Coa&s;t being infe&s;ted with Sharks, which &s;ometimes meet with Peo|ple, and bite off a Limb: But being there had not been any &s;een that Day, I wou'd venture, but ty'd a Rope about me, for fear of any Accident that might happen, or the Wind &s;triking up of a &s;udden. But I had not been long in the Water, before they cry'd from the Gunnel, A Shark! a Shark! but I thinking they had only ban|ter'd, as &s;ometimes they do, when any one is in the Water, did not mind 'em, till at la&s;t they pull'd me by main Force, up the &s;ide of the Ship; when looking into the Water, I &s;aw a &s;winging large Shark, with his white Belly turn'd up in order to bite at me. Upon which I thank'd God and
<PB N="57" REF="63">
good Friends that had prevented him, by &s;wiftly pulling me up; though the Rope had rubb'd off the Skin, and &s;ome part of my Fle&s;h, with the Force. Now a Shark cannot get his Prey, without fir&s;t turning him&s;elf upon his Back, becau&s;e their upper Jaw is much larger than their under: Which often prevents Accidents.</P>
<P>I one Day went down into the Hold, to bottle off a &s;mall Parcel of Wine that I had there, for fear 'twou'd &s;owre, which made me in a filthy Pickle: Coming upon Deck again, I wanted to clean my &s;elf, but did not care to go into the Water, as be|fore, &s;o went into the Boat a&s;tern, that we hoi&s;ted overboard in the Morning, to look after a Wreck that we di&s;cover'd up|on the Water: Being in the Boat, I began to wa&s;h my &s;elf, and when I had dre&s;s'd my &s;elf again, I pull'd a Book out of my Pocket, and &s;ate reading in the Boat; when, before I was aware, a Storm began to ri&s;e, &s;o that I cou'd not get up the Ship-&s;ide, as u&s;ual, but call'd for the Ladder of Ropes, that hangs over the Ship's Quarter, in order to get up that way; but whether it was not fa&s;ten'd above, or whether it broke through Rottenne&s;s, as being &s;eldom us'd, I can't tell, but down I fell into the Sea; and though the Ship (as they told me after|wards)
<PB N="58" REF="64">
tack'd about to take me up, if it was po&s;&s;ible; yet I lo&s;t &s;ight of 'em, thro' the Duskine&s;s of the Evening, and the Storm together. Now I had the mo&s;t di&s;|mal Fears that cou'd ever po&s;&s;e&s;s any one in my Condition: I was forc'd to drive with the Wind, which &s;ate (by good For|tune) with the Current, and having kept my &s;elf above Water, as near as I could gue&s;s in this Fright, four Hours, I felt my Feet every now and then touch Ground; and at la&s;t, by a great Wave&punc; was thrown and left upon the Sand; yet it being dark, I knew not what to do; but I got up and walk'd, as well as my tir'd Limbs wou'd let me; and every now and then was over|taken by the Waves, but not high enough to wa&s;h me away.</P>
<P>When I had got far enough, as I thought, to be out of Danger, I cou'd not di&s;cover any thing of Land, and I immediately con|jectur'd that it was but &s;ome Bank of Sand, that the Sea wou'd overflow at high Tide: Whereupon I &s;ate down to re&s;t my weary Limbs, and fit my &s;elf for Death, for that was all I cou'd expect, in my own Opinion. Then all my Sins came flying in my Face, which I repented of with all the Sincerity imaginable: I offer'd up my fervent Prayers to our Almighty Creator, not for my Safe|ty
<PB N="59" REF="65">
(becau&s;e I did not expect any &s;uch Thing) but for all my pa&s;t Offences; and I may really &s;ay, I expected my Di&s;&s;olution with a Calmne&s;s that made me think I had made my Peace with Heaven. At la&s;t I fell a&s;leep, (tho' I try'd all I could again&s;t it, by ri&s;ing up and walking, till I was oblig'd to lie down again.) In the Morning when I a|wak'd, I was amaz'd to find my &s;elf among four or five very low &s;andy I&s;lands, but all &s;eparated half a Mile or more (as I gue&s;s'd) by the Sea. With that I began to be a lit|tle chearful, and walk'd about to &s;ee if I could find any thing that was eatable, but to my great Grief I found nothing but a few Eggs, that I was oblig'd to eat raw; this laid my Condition before my Eyes in a mo&s;t horrid Manner, and the Fear of &s;tarv|ing &s;eem'd to me to be wor&s;e than that of drowning; and oft did I wi&s;h that the Sea had &s;wallow'd me, rather than thrown me on this de&s;olate I&s;land; for I cou'd per|ceive by the Evenne&s;s of 'em, that they were not inhabited either by Man, or Bea&s;t, or any Thing el&s;e, but Rats, and &s;everal &s;orts of Fowl.</P>
<P>Upon this I&s;land there was &s;ome few Bu&s;hes of a Wood they call'd <HI>Burton</HI> Wood, which us'd to be my Shelter at Night; but to compleat my Mi&s;ery, there was not to be
<PB N="60" REF="66">
found one drop of fre&s;h Water on the I&s;land; &s;o that I was forc'd to drink my own Urine for two or three Days together; which made my Skin come off like the Peal of a boil'd Codlin. At la&s;t my Mi&s;ery &s;o encreas'd, that I was often in the Mind to put an end to my wretched Life, but de&s;i&s;ted, on the Opinion that I had of &s;ome Alligator, or other voracious Creature, coming to do it for me. Strange Circum&s;tances indeed! to wi&s;h to be devour'd alive, as a Mitigation of my Misfortunes.</P>
<P>I had liv'd a Week here upon Eggs only, when, by good Fortune, upon a Bu&s;h I di&s;|cover'd a Booby &s;itting; I ran immediately, as fa&s;t as I cou'd, and with a Stick knock'd him down: I never con&s;ider'd whether it was proper to eat or no, but I &s;uck'd the Blood, and eat the Fle&s;h, with &s;uch a Plea|&s;ure as none can expre&s;s, but them that have felt the Pain of Hunger to the &s;ame Degree as my &s;elf. After I had devour'd this Banquet, I walk'd about, and di&s;cover'd many more of the&s;e Birds, which I &s;lew.</P>
<P>Now my Stomach being pretty well appeas'd, I began to con&s;ider whether I could not, with two Sticks, make a Fire, as I had &s;een Blacks in <HI>Jamaica:</HI> I try'd with all the Wood I could get, and at la&s;t happily did it. This done, I gather'd &s;ome
<PB N="61" REF="67">
Sticks, and made a Fire, pick'd &s;everal of my Boobies, and broil'd 'em, as well as I cou'd; and now I re&s;olv'd to come to an Allowance. This Bird is a Water Fowl, a|bout the bigne&s;s of a large Crow; of grey Colour; it has a long &s;trong Bill, and Feet like a Duck, and its Fle&s;h &s;eem'd to me to ta&s;te &s;omething like a Duck's, but &s;tronger, and a little Fi&s;hy: And it is &s;uch a Booby, that it will not get out of your Way with|out beating.</P>
<P>At Night I and the re&s;t of my Fellow-Inhabitants, had a great Storm of Rain and Thunder, with the rede&s;t Lightning I had ever &s;een, which well wa&s;h'd us all, I be|lieve; as for my &s;elf, my Cloaths (which were only a pair of thin Shoes and Thread Stockings, and a Cotton Wa&s;tcoat and Breeches) were &s;oundly wet; but I had this Happine&s;s, to find in the Morning &s;everal Cavities of Rain-Water, which put in my Head a Thought of making a deep Well, or hollow Place, that I might have Water continually by me; which I brought to Per|fection in this Manner: I took a Piece of Wood I found on the I&s;land, and pitch'd upon a Place under a Burton-Tree, where with my Hands and the Stick together, I dug a Hole, or Well, big enough to con|tain a Hog&s;head of Water, then put in
<PB N="62" REF="68">
Stones and pa v'd it, and got in and &s;tamp'd 'em down ha rd all round, and with my Stick beat th e &s;ides clo&s;e, &s;o that I made it capable of holding Water for a long Time.</P>
<P>But now the Difficulty was, how to get the Water there, which at la&s;t I con|triv'd very well, for with my Shirt (which was pretty fine) I effected it, by &s;oaking it in Water for &s;ome Time, and then afterwards it wou'd bear it very well; &s;o with this Holland-Bucket I cou'd carry two Gallons of Water at a Time, which wou'd not leak out above a Pint, in two hundred Yards; &s;o in two Days Time I had fill'd my Well.</P>
<P>Now I began to think of Life again for a while, for I had ready broil'd forty of the&s;e Boobies, de&s;igning to allow my &s;elf half a one a Day. I al&s;o made my &s;elf a Cu pboard of Earth, by mixing Water with it, which was four Foot in Length, three in Heighth, and two in Breadth, though it la&s;ted but four Days, the Sun drying it &s;o fa&s;t, that it crack'd, and afterwards fell in pieces. What mo&s;t amaz'd me, and pleas'd me together, was, that my Boobies continu'd &s;weet without the lea&s;t Taint. I had a &s;mall <HI>Ovid</HI> printed
<PB N="63" REF="69">
by <HI>Elziver,</HI> which I had by good Fortune put in my Breeches Pocket, when I was going up the Ladder of Ropes, and by be|ing pre&s;s'd clo&s;e in my Pocket, was not quite &s;poil'd, but only the Cover off, and &s;tain'd a little with the Wet. This was a great Mitigation of my Misfortunes, for I could entertain my &s;elf in this Book, un|der a Burton-Bu&s;h, till I fell a&s;leep. I re|main'd always in good Health, only a lit|tle troubled with the Head-Ach, for want of a Hat, which I lo&s;t in the Water, in falling down from the Ladder of Ropes. But I remedy'd this as well a I could, by ga|thering a Parcel of Chicken-Weed (which grows there in Plenty) and &s;trewing it over the Burton-Bu&s;hes, under which I &s;ate. Nay, at la&s;t, finding my Time might be longer there than I expected, I tore off one of the Sleeves of my Shirt, and lin'd a wooden Cap, that I had made of green &s;prigs, and twi&s;ted with the green Bark that I peel'd off, &s;o that if I had been &s;een in this Figure, I &s;hou'd have appear'd like a Mad|man with the Basket of a Cudgel upon his Head.</P>
<P>One Day coming from wa&s;hing my &s;elf, (which I us'd often to do to cool me) I heard a flouncing in the Water, and turn|ing my Head, to &s;ee from whence the Noi&s;e
<PB N="64" REF="70">
came, I &s;aw the odde&s;t Fi&s;h, I believe&punc; that ever was known. It had (as I &s;up|po&s;e) chas'd &s;ome other Fi&s;h very eagerly, and run it &s;elf too far on the Sand, and the Tide being almo&s;t at the lowe&s;t, it had left it there. It was (as near as I cou'd gue&s;s) about fifteen Foot long; it had a Head like a Hor&s;e, and out of the Mouth came two Horns curl'd like a Ram's Horn, only twice as large; it had but one Eye, and that was at the Extremity of the No&s;e; it &s;eem'd, as it flounc'd, to be &s;omething of a changeable A&s;h-colour, with a Tail that taper'd to the End in a &s;harp Point: it look'd &s;o terrible to me, that I was afraid to approach it; as it labour'd it &s;eem'd to groan; it lay in this Hole of Water half an Hour, with its Body in, and its Tail out; and as &s;oon as the Tide came up to it, it &s;hak'd its Tail to and fro, as a Dog does when he &s;eems pleas'd, all the while it felt the Water; it &s;truggled but now and then, and at la&s;t, when the Water was pretty high, it turn'd its Head, and made a Noi&s;e &s;omething like the Clucking of a Hen with Chickens, but louder; and when it had Water enough to &s;wim away, it lay moving up and down a quarter of an Hour, being as I &s;uppo&s;e hurt with its &s;truggling. A Gentleman of my Acquaintance advis'd me to leave this De&s;cription out; for, &s;ays
<PB N="65" REF="71">
he, No Body will believe it. I reply'd, I did not care for that, as I was &s;atisfied in my &s;elf it was true.</P>
<P>I had been here now a Month, by my Reckoning, and in that Time my Skin look'd as if it had been rubb'd over with Walnut-&s;hells. I had a Mind &s;everal Times to have &s;wam to one of the other I&s;lands; but as they look'd only like Heaps of Sand, I thought I had got the be&s;t Birth, &s;o con|tented my &s;elf with my own Station. Boobies I could get enough, (who build on the Ground) and another Bird that lays the Eggs which I us'd to eat, but I never ven|tur'd to ta&s;te of 'em, though as their Eggs were good, we may &s;uppo&s;e their Fle&s;h was &s;o too: But however, I was &s;o well &s;ati&s;|fied with my Boobies, that I did not care to try Experiments.</P>
<P>This I&s;land which I was upon, &s;eem'd to me to be about two Miles in Circum|ference, and was almo&s;t round, and on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> &s;ide there's a good Anchoring-place, for the Water is very deep, within two Fa|thom of the Shore.

have found &s;ome Nece&s;&s;aries which I want|ed: But I wou'd often check my &s;elf in the&s;e Cogitations, as not becoming a Chri&s;ti|an; yet they wou'd as often awake in my Mind, in &s;pight of all my Devotion and other good Thoughts; it being natural to de&s;ire Company. I us'd to fancy, that if I &s;hou'd be forc'd to &s;tay there long, I &s;hou'd forget my Speech; &s;o I us'd to talk aloud, ask my &s;elf Que&s;tions, and an&s;wer 'em; but if any Body had been by to have heard me, they wou'd certainly have thought me bewitch'd, I us'd to ask my &s;elf &s;uch odd Que&s;tions. All this while I cou'd not in|form my &s;elf where I was, or how near any inhabited Place.</P>
<P>One Morning (which I took to be the 8th of <HI>November)</HI> a violent Storm aro&s;e, which continu'd till Noon, when in the mean time I ob&s;erv'd a Bark labouring with the Waves for &s;everal Hours, and at la&s;t, with the Violence of the Tempe&s;t, was perfectly thrown out of the Water upon the &s;hore, within a quarter of a Mile from the Place where I ob&s;erv'd 'em. I ran to &s;ee if there was any Body I could be a&s;|&s;i&s;ting to, where I found four Men (being all that was in the Ve&s;&s;el) bu&s;y about &s;aving what they could out of her: When I came up with 'em, and hail'd 'em in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="73">
they &s;eem'd mightily &s;urpriz'd; they ask'd me how I came there, and how long I had been there? When I told 'em my Story, they were all mightily concern'd for them|&s;elves, as well as for me, for they found there was no Po&s;&s;ibility of getting their Bark off the Sands, being the Wind had forc'd her &s;o far: With that we began to bemoan one another's Misfortunes; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s to you, without lying, I was never more rejoic'd in my whole Life; for they had on Board plenty of every thing for a Twelvemonth, and not any thing &s;poil'd. Their Lading (which was Logwood) they had thrown over board to lighten their Ship; which was the Occa&s;ion of the Wind forcing her &s;o far: Had they kept in their Lading, they wou'd have bulg'd in the Sands half a quarter a Mile from the Place where they did, and the Sea flying over 'em, wou'd not only have &s;poil'd their Pro|vi&s;ions, but perhaps been the Death of 'em all. By the&s;e Men I under&s;tood where we were, <HI>viz.</HI> upon one of the I&s;les of <HI>Alcranes,</HI> which are five I&s;lands, or rather large Banks of Sand; (for there is not a Tree, nor Bu&s;h, upon any but that where we were) they lie in the Latitude of twen|ty two Degrees <HI>North,</HI> twenty five Leagues from <HI>Jucatan,</HI> and about &s;ixty from <HI>Cam|peachy</HI> Town. We work'd as fa&s;t as we
<PB N="68" REF="74">
cou'd, and got out every Thing that wou'd be u&s;eful to us, before Night. We had &s;ix Barrels of &s;alt Beef, three of Pork, two of Pea&s;e, and two of Flower, and eleven Barrels of Bisket; a &s;mall Copper, and an Iron Pot; &s;everal wearing Cloaths, and a &s;pare Hat, which I wanted mightily: We had be&s;ides, &s;everal Cags of Rum, and one of Brandy, and a Che&s;t of Sugar, with many other Things of U&s;e: &s;ome Gun|powder, and one Fowling-piece. We took off the Sails from the Yards, and with &s;ome pieces of Timber erected a Tent big enough to hold twenty Men, under which we put their Beds, that we got from the Bark. 'Tis true we had no Shelter from the Weather, for the Trees were &s;o low that they were of no U&s;e to us. I now thought my &s;elf in a Palace, and was as merry, as if I had been at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> or even at home in my own Country: I cou'd joak now and then, and tell a mer|ry Tale. In &s;hort, when we had been there &s;ome Time, we began to be very ea&s;y, and to wait contentedly, till Provi|dence &s;hou'd fetch us out of this I&s;land. The Bark lay upon the Sands, fifty Yards from the Water when at the highe&s;t, &s;o that I us'd to lie in her Cabin, by rea&s;on there was no more Beds a&s;hore, than was for my four Companions, <HI>viz. Thomas</HI>

<HI>Randal,</HI> of <HI>Cork</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> (who&s;e Bed was large&s;t, which he did me the Favour to &s;pare a part of now and then, when the Wind was high, and I did not care to lie on Board) <HI>Richard White,</HI> of <HI>Port Royal, William Mu&s;grave,</HI> of <HI>King&s;ton</HI> in <HI>Ja|maica,</HI> and <HI>Ralph Middleton,</HI> of&mdash;The&s;e Men, with eight others, &s;et out of <HI>Port Royal</HI> about a Month after us, bound for the &s;ame Place: But tho&s;e others lying a&s;hore, and wandring too far up in the Country, were met, as 'tis &s;uppos'd, by &s;ome <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> who &s;et up|on 'em: Yet by all Appearance they fought de&s;perately, for when Mr. <HI>Randal</HI> and Mr. <HI>Middleton</HI> went to &s;eek for 'em, they found all the eight dead, with fifteen <HI>Indians,</HI> and two <HI>Spaniards;</HI> all the <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> had &s;everal Cuts in their Heads, Arms, Brea&s;ts, &amp;c. that made it very plainly ap|pear, they had &s;old their Lives dearly.

As for the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they &s;trip'd 'em, and left 'em above Ground, as they found 'em, and made all the ha&s;te they could to imbark, for fear of any other unlucky Ac|cident that might happen. They &s;et &s;ail
<PB N="70" REF="76">
as &s;oon as ever they came on board, and made the be&s;t of their way for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> till they were overtaken by the Storm that &s;hipwreck'd 'em on <HI>Make Shift I&s;land</HI> (as I had nam'd it.) When I told them of the &s;trange Fi&s;h I had &s;een, there was not any of 'em, but Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave,</HI> that had &s;een it, and he told me, when he was a Pri&s;o|ner in <HI>Mexico,</HI> he had &s;een one there, and they call'd it the <HI>Ram Fi&s;h;</HI> but he told me I was mi&s;taken concerning the Eyes, for they were on the top of the Head, but ve|ry &s;mall, not bigger than a Musket-ball; and that which I took for an Eye, was a Hole that they &s;ometimes &s;pouted Water through. This that he &s;aw at <HI>Mexico,</HI> was carried about for a Shew in a Cart, but it was but eight Foot and a half in Length, and was by Order of the Viceroy &s;ent two Leagues into the Bay, to be bury'd, for it &s;tunk &s;o intolerably, they were afraid it wou'd breed a Plague.</P>
<P>Now we had all Manner of Fi&s;hing-Tackle with us, but we wanted a Boat to go a little way from Shore to catch Fi&s;h, therefore we &s;et our Wits to work, in or|der to make &s;ome manner of Engine, and at la&s;t we pitch'd upon this odd Project: We took &s;ix Casks, and tarr'd 'em all over,
<PB N="71" REF="77">
then &s;top'd up the Bungs with Cork, and nail'd 'em clo&s;e down with a piece of tarr'd Canvas, the&s;e &s;ix Casks we ty'd to|gether with &s;ome of the Cords of the Ve&s;|&s;el, and upon them we plac'd the Skuttles of the Deck, and fix'd them, and made it &s;o &s;trong, that two Men might ea&s;ily &s;it upon 'em, but for fear a Storm &s;hou'd hap|pen, we ty'd to one end of her a Coil or two of &s;mall Rope, of five hundred Fa|thom long, which we fix'd to a Stake on the Shore: Then two of 'em went out, (as for my part, I was no Fi&s;herman) in or|der to &s;ee what Succe&s;s they &s;hou'd have, but return'd with only one <HI>Nur&s;e,</HI> a Fi&s;h &s;o called, about two Foot long, &s;omething like a Shark, only its Skin is very rough, and, when dry, will do the &s;ame Office as a Seal-skin. The &s;ame boil'd in Lemon|juice, is the only Remedy in the World for the Scurvy, by applying &s;ome of the Skin to the Calfs of your Legs, and rubbing your Body with &s;ome of the Liquor, once or twice.

&s;o kind to give me a Blow on the Fore|head, that cut the Skin, and bled very much; which was done with her Fins, for as they run towards the Water, they throw backwards the Gravel, as Hor&s;es do when they gallop hard; this we &s;alted, and it eat very well, after lying two or three Days in the Brine.</P>

<P>_WE pa&s;t our Time in this <HI>Make&s;hift I&s;land</HI> as well as we could; we invent|ed &s;everal Games to di|vert our &s;elves: One Day, when we had been merry, Sorrow (as after Gaiety often

happens) &s;tole in&s;en&s;ibly on us all. I, as being the younge&s;t, began to reflect on my &s;ad Condition, in &s;pending my Youth on a Barren Land, without Hopes of be|ing ever redeem'd. Whereupon, Mr. <HI>Ran|dal,</HI> being the Elde&s;t, ro&s;e up and made the following Speech, as nigh as I can remember.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Falconer,</HI> and my Fellow-Sufferers; but 'tis to you (pointing at me) that I chiefly addre&s;s my Speech, being you &s;eem to de&s;pair of a Redemption from this Place, (as you call it) more than any other of the &s;ame Condition. Is not the Providence of a Power Su|preme &s;hewn in every Accident in the Life of Man; even you your &s;elf, how much better is your Condition now, than you cou'd have imagin'd it wou'd have been a Month ago? There is a Virtue in man|ly Suffering, and to repine, &s;eems to doubt of the All-&s;eeing Power, which regulates our Actions. If you &s;eem con|&s;cious of your de&s;erving (as a Puni&s;h|ment for any Crime you have committed) what has happen'd, why do you not with a contrite Heart, lift up your Voice
<PB N="3" REF="81">
to Heaven, and &s;incerely ask Forgivene&s;s of all your pa&s;t Offences, and that Way free your &s;elf of tho&s;e gro&s;s Errors that are crept into your weak Faith. Think you that the Divine Providence that ca&s;t <HI>Jonas</HI> from the Bowels of the Whale, has not that Retentive Power &s;till left, to aid and fetch us from this Place?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, tho' touch'd with what he &s;aid, I could not forbear &s;miling at the Word <HI>Retentive,</HI> which brought to my Mind an Image very diverting in an Acci|dent that happen'd once to me in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince my Sea Adventures, and perhaps one Time or other I may communicate to my Friends, which I'm &s;ure will divert 'em; for my living on Shore for the&s;e &s;ix Years la&s;t pa&s;t, has been as extraordinary as my Adventures at Sea.</P>
<P>Here (pur&s;u'd he) we have every Thing that can be requir'd to &s;atisfy Nature; we have Beds to lie on, and a Cover|ing from the Weather; we have Provi&s;i|ons for a Twelvemonth, and if we &s;hou'd continue here a longer Time, we need not fear &s;tarving, the very I&s;land produ|cing wherewithal to &s;upport Nature, as
<PB N="4" REF="82">
Eggs and Fowls; and tho' there is no River or Rivulet of fre&s;h Water, yet it rains &s;o frequently, we need not fear even that, being we have Ve&s;&s;els enough to &s;ave it in: You have the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to &s;purn at Providence of any one here, that had only a Hole in the Earth to &s;ave your Water, which had not la&s;ted two Days longer, before we (very happily for you) were thrown on Shore. Is there not a Providence in being thrown on Land, when you expected Drown|ing before the Morning dawn'd, which happen'd otherwi&s;e? Is there not a Pro|vidence in getting Food, when you expe|cted to &s;tarve? Is there not a Providence in getting Fire by rubbing two Sticks, which you know you could not effect &s;ince, tho' we have all endeavour'd at it? Was it not a Providence, that your Boo|bies remain'd &s;weet, even till the Day that we came here? And was it not a Providence that we were thrown here, which brought you all Sorts of Provi&s;i|ons, (I mean all that is nece&s;&s;ary) with Flint, and Steel, and other Uten&s;ils? And can you then doubt of a farther Provi|dence,

that have had all the&s;e? Be&s;ides, even Company is &s;ome Allay to Sorrow, you were alone before, and had only your &s;elf to talk too. Our Bark is &s;trong and firm, and by Degrees, I don't doubt but with Time and much Labour, to get her into the Water again. I have been a Board her this Morning when you were all a&s;leep, and examin'd her carefully In|&s;ide and Out, and fancy our Liberty may &s;oon be effected; I only wonder we have never thought before of clearing the Sand from our Ve&s;&s;el, which once done, I be|lieve we may Launch her out into deep Water; we have all our Tackling, Sails and Ma&s;ts entire, without Damage; I don't de&s;pair of the Mercy of God in working our Deliverance, who&s;e Ways are pa&s;t the Knowledge of us poor in&s;ig|nificant Mortals.

<P>In a Voyage I made twelve Years a|go, I &s;uffer'd Shipwreck, and not one Per&s;on &s;av'd but my &s;elf: I &s;et out from the City of <HI>Cork</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> on Board a Bark bound for the <HI>Baltick,</HI> we pa&s;t the
<PB N="6" REF="84">
<HI>Straits</HI> of <HI>El&s;enor</HI> and <HI>Hel&s;inburgh,</HI> with|out meeting any thing material; when one Evening it began to Thunder, Light|en and Rain prodigiou&s;ly; the Storm was &s;o violent, that we expected every Mo|ment when we &s;hould be drove on Shore on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sweedland,</HI> or <HI>Nor|way,</HI> and be da&s;h'd to Pieces. The Storm continu'd &s;o long, that all our Ma&s;ts came by the Board, our Ve&s;&s;el &s;prung a Leak, and the Water gain'd upon us e|very Moment; at la&s;t it overpower'd us &s;o much, that we left Pumping, as believ|ing it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave our&s;elves, and re|commended our Souls to the Mercy of the Lord. At la&s;t our Ship &s;unk down|right, and mo&s;t of our Men with it; but I and two more had the good Fortune to lay hold of the Main-Ma&s;t, (that had been cut above Deck, being it was &s;prung below, and thrown Over-board to pre|vent any Danger) which was tangled in &s;ome of the Cordage; but the Ship &s;ink|ing downright, with the Rope that was turn'd to the Main-Ma&s;t, gave it &s;uch a Tug, that pull'd it under Water; but afterwards loo&s;ing or &s;lipping off by good
<PB N="7" REF="85">
Fortune, it ro&s;e with two of us again, but the third was never &s;een after. The other that &s;av'd him&s;elf upon the Ma&s;t, was the Ma&s;ter, a Man about Sixty Years old, who held pretty well for a|bout an Hour, but at la&s;t thro' Weakne&s;s and Age (recommending his Soul to God) fell off; but yet call'd for Help, and I being willing to give, laid hold of him, which I had no &s;ooner done, but he gra&s;p'd at me, and laying fa&s;t hold of the Skirt of my Wa&s;tcoat, (having never a Coat on) pull'd me off the Ma&s;t; but with his Weight and &s;ome Strugling I made to &s;ave my &s;elf, my Skirt rip'd off, and the Ma&s;ter &s;unk to the Bottom, and I by good Fortune laid hold of the Rig|ing that hung to the Ma&s;t; &s;o once more got on &s;tride it, but with little Hopes of Life: yet doing my Endeavour to &s;ave my &s;elf, but with a Re&s;ignation to the Will of Heaven. At la&s;t, after being to&s;s|ed about for two or three Hours more, the End of the Ma&s;t ru&s;h'd with &s;uch Vi|olence again&s;t a Rock, (as I &s;uppos'd) that with the Shock I was thrown off; but laid hold of &s;ome of the Cordage a|gain,
<PB N="8" REF="86">
and held fa&s;t till it fix'd it &s;elf in &s;ome of the craggy Cliffs of the Rock.</P>
<P>By this Time the Tempe&s;t was very much abated, and the Waves not da&s;hing &s;o often, nor &s;o fierce, I found that the Ma&s;t hung on the craggy Clifts of the Rock, which I climb'd up as fa&s;t as I could, lea&s;t another Wave &s;hould da&s;h me again&s;t it, and beat my Brains out. After I had got as high as I could, and out of Danger of the Waves, I kneel'd down and return'd Thanks to the Almighty for my wonderful Deliverance; which was won|derful indeed! For tho' the Ma&s;t beat &s;o often again&s;t the Rock, yet I e&s;cap'd with|out being &s;o much as bruis'd. When I had poured out the Fullne&s;s of my Soul to the All-&s;eeing Power, that had protected me from &s;uch an imminent Danger, I com|pos'd my &s;elf to &s;leep, but with a Calm|ne&s;s wonderful, (even to my &s;elf) won|derful in every Circum&s;tance, that the Almighty Providence &s;hould chu&s;e me out of thirty poor Souls that peri&s;h'd in the &s;tormy Deep, for a Monument of his Mercy. I &s;lept, but yet my Dreams were troubled; I thought in my Sleep, I
<PB N="9" REF="87">
was ca&s;t on Shore upon a Barren Rock, where there was not a Creature but my &s;elf, no Food, nor any Thing to &s;u&s;tain Nature; which prov'd too true. I was awak'd by &s;omething that lick'd my Face, which in my Fright I laid hold on, but &s;oon let it go again upon finding it hairy, which &s;tartled me very much; and tho' it was &s;till dark, I could not go to &s;leep again for the Concern I was in, for fear of &s;ome devouring Creature &s;hould come and &s;eize me. I li&s;tened, and ob&s;erved the Storm was laid, and the Dawn approaching, I began to com|po&s;e my Mind, and to put my Tru&s;t in him, that had hitherto pre&s;erved me.</P>
<P>When it came to be light enough to perceive any Object, I ro&s;e up and be|gan to view the Place; when, to my great Surprize, I found it to be only a large Rock, about half a Mile in Cir|cumference as near as I could gue&s;s; but the North Part &s;o inacce&s;&s;ible, there was no getting to the Top of it: Looking about me, I &s;aw coming fawn|ing towards me, a large Bitch, which
<PB N="10" REF="88">
was the Creature had awak'd me by licking my Face. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was &s;urprized and pleas'd, and made much of my new Companion. I hop'd from it I &s;hould find &s;ome humane Creatures; but &s;earching about and not meeting with any, I was more grieved than before; yet &s;till I re&s;ign'd my &s;elf to the Will of him that &s;ees all Things, and knew it was in his Power to fetch me out of Darkne&s;s and the Shadow of Death. In walking up and down in a little Cavity of the Rock, I met with &s;even young &s;uck|ing Puppies, that I found belong'd to the Bitch my Companion, for &s;he gave them &s;uck, which I &s;tay'd a little while to ob&s;erve. Then a Thought came into my Head, that this might be &s;ome re|&s;ort for Fi&s;hermen, and I &s;hould very &s;hortly &s;ee &s;ome that would take me from this de&s;olate Place.</P>
<P>I began to &s;earch about for &s;omething to &s;u&s;tain Nature, but could find no|thing but &s;ome <HI>Perriwinkles,</HI> and other little Shell-fi&s;h, which I ventured to feed upon, for now I began to be very hun|gry. I wonder'd mightily at my poor
<PB N="11" REF="89">
Bitch, how &s;he got Food to &s;upport her &s;elf, and her &s;even young Ones. I ob|&s;erved &s;he u&s;ed to leave me two or three times a Day, but return'd in a quarter of an Hour. One Day I had the Curio&s;ity to watch her, but &s;he went &s;o fa&s;t, that I could not come up to her; but &s;till I follow'd, and at la&s;t came to the Point of a Rock where &s;he went down, and look|ing below, &s;aw her feeding upon a dead <HI>Seal;</HI> but how it came there I could not &s;uppo&s;e, neither could I go down the Rock to &s;ee farther, it being &s;o dange|rous a Place: When &s;he had eat her fill, &s;he came up again, and went to give her young Ones &s;uck. I was mightily put to it for Water, tho' there was good Quantities in &s;everal Cavities of the Rock, but &s;o hard to come at, that &s;ometimes I ventured breaking my Neck to get it; be&s;ides, I could not expect that would always la&s;t, for the Sun was pretty warm, tho' not intolerable. I had in my Pocket a Knife and Fork and a Ca&s;e of Lancets, but they were ru&s;ted by be|ing wet, and of no u&s;e to me, for I could get nothing to exerci&s;e 'em on;
<PB N="12" REF="90">
indeed my Fork &s;erv'd me to twi&s;t out my Perriwinkles.</P>
<P>I had been here now fifteen Days, and nothing to feed on but the&s;e &s;ort of Shell|fi&s;h; yet &s;till my Strength and Health continued to a Miracle: I &s;lep'd well, tho' my Bed was &s;omething hard: It was compos'd of part of the Rigging that came on Shore with the Ma&s;t, which I had untwi&s;ted, and pull'd into <HI>Oakham,</HI> and laid it under an hollow Part of the Rock, where no Rain or Wind could hurt me, unle&s;s it blew hard South, which when it did, would force a little into my Bed-Chamber.</P>
<P>Looking out one Day I &s;aw a Boat coming towards my Rocky I&s;land, the &s;ight rais'd my Spirits wonderfully, but ob&s;erving her narrowly, I found &s;he was only driving, by the Wind and Tide, without any one in her: However I got down my Rock, and waited for her coming on Shore, which &s;he did within twenty Yards of me; I immediately got in her to rumage her, and, &s;uprizing Provi|dence! found twenty dry'd Fi&s;h, a Salt-Box fill'd with Bisket, and about half a
<PB N="13" REF="91">
Pint of Brandy in a Bottle. After gi|ving God Thanks with great Sincerity of Soul, I fell to, and eat heartily. There were two Oars in the Boat, a Boat-Hook, a &s;mall Fi&s;her-Net, and a Tinder-Box, with a Grapling Iron and Rope for a Cable: Upon this I began to be exceed|ing ea&s;y, and thought my &s;elf to be in a happy Condition: I brought my Fi&s;h on Shore, and &s;tow'd it in my Bed-Chamber, and over it, (for fear of my Bitch,) put &s;everal Pieces of Ropes. I had a Tinder Box, and could &s;trike a Light, but had no Candle to burn nor any Provi&s;ion to dre&s;s.</P>
<P>After I had &s;ettled every Thing as I would have it, I re&s;olv'd to take my Boat and go round the Rock, to &s;ee if I could di&s;cover any Thing on the other &s;ide of the inacce&s;&s;ible Part. Whereupon I took two of my dry'd Fi&s;h, and Half a Dozen Biskets, and put my &s;elf on Board; but my poor Bitch came to the Shore Side, and took on &s;o migh|tily, that I went and took her in. I row'd half round, (as near as I could gue&s;s) the fir&s;t Day; but what made me
<PB N="14" REF="92">
&s;o long was, that in &s;ome Places, I was oblig'd to row half a League from Shore, to avoid &s;ome Shallows which lay out towards the North Ea&s;t &s;ide. I ventured to lie in my Boat all Night, and the next Morning went onward in my Voyage, and at la&s;t came to that Part of the Rock that I could not get over when I was a Shore. Here I found upon the Ground a Ne&s;t of Eggs, about the Bigne&s;s of a Duck Egg, yet I could not di&s;cover what Fowl own'd them; but I took 'em all a|way, and ventured to &s;uck one of them, which I found as plea&s;ant as a new laid Hen Egg. Here the Bitch grew very un|ea&s;y, and by her whining and fruitle&s;s Endeavours to pa&s;s the Rock, (which was Perpendicular) let me under&s;tand &s;he wanted to be with her Puppies. Finding nothing here for my Benefit, but my Eggs, I got on Board, and endea|voured to go round, which I did, till I came to the Place where the Seal lay that my Bitch found, but it &s;tunk abo|minably; yet &s;he fell to, and after ha|ving eat, ran up the Rock, and &s;o (as I &s;uppo&s;e,) to her Puppies. I went on

Board again; but there aro&s;e &s;uch a Fog of a &s;uddain, that I could hardly &s;ee the Length of the Boat, &s;o rather cho&s;e to go back again than venture farther out of my Knowledge, which I did in a little time, the Sea being higher over the Sand, and arrived at my own Habitation.</P>
<P>I pull'd up my Boat as high as I could, and went on Shore, and coming to vi&s;it my young Companions found the weak|e&s;t dead for want of the Dam, which I immediately took, cut open and flay'd off the Skin, when after being dry'd, I made me a Cap of, by cutting it in form, and &s;ewing it together with &s;ome fine Rope Yarn that I twi&s;ted on pupo&s;e, and my Fork I us'd in&s;tead of a Needle. The Fat &s;erv'd me to make Candles in this Manner, by pulling to Pieces &s;ome Rope Yarn and twi&s;ting it hard; then I &s;truck a Light, and with an Egg-Shell heated my Fat, and drew the Rope Yarn thro' it, &s;o I provided my &s;elf with a new &s;ort of Candle. But then I had but a &s;mall Piece of Match, and when that &s;hould be gone, I &s;hould be at a &s;trange lo&s;s how to light my Candle.</P>

Finding my Provi&s;ion decrea&s;e, I came to an Allowance of a Quarter of a Fi&s;h a Day, and Half a Bisket, and not to touch that if I could get any Shell-fi&s;h, which began to be &s;carce too, for &s;ome Days I could not find above Ten or Twelve, and when I came fir&s;t there, I us'd to take 'em up by Handfuls. Upon this I began to reflect, that Winter was approaching, and con&s;equently very cold Weather; and then perhaps I &s;hould not get any Food; I re&s;olved within my &s;elf to venture in my Boat, and &s;ail which way the Wind &s;hould direct me, but then I was put to it for a Sail, (for we had cut off the Yards and Sails of the Main Ma&s;t, before we threw it over Board) but at la&s;t I thought of a White Dimit|ty Wa&s;tcoat that I wore, which was lin'd with Linnen, this I unript and &s;ew'd together again, &s;o pieced the Li|ning to the Out&s;ides, and made me a tolerable Sail. But in the mean time the Wind blew &s;o high, that I dur&s;t not venture out; and continued &s;o long, that my Provi&s;ion was dimini&s;h'd to two Fi&s;h, which almo&s;t put me to my Wits End.
<PB N="17" REF="95">
Shell-Fi&s;h were not to be had. So at la&s;t I re&s;olv'd to kill one of my Bitch's Whelps; which I did, made a Fire with &s;ome Boards I found at the Bottom of my Boat, and roa&s;ted it; 'twas palatable and eat wonderfully well, they being not two Months old.</P>
<P>I don't que&s;tion but you'll all laugh at me, when I &s;hall tell you that it went very much again&s;t me to kill this harm|le&s;s Creature; but my Nece&s;&s;ity had no Law; be&s;ides, I had ob&s;erv'd but two Days before, that the Seal, which was the Dam's Food, was gnaw'd to the Bones. In &s;hort, after &s;ome Strugglings with my &s;elf, I kill'd five of the &s;ix, and &s;alted two of 'em; for after eating my Biskets out of the Salt-Box, I found a Handful or two of Salt at the Bottom, which I made u&s;e of in that Manner. The Intrails I boil'd, and gave to the Dam and other Puppy, who eat of it heartily, making no Scruple tho' their own Fle&s;h and Blood. The &s;ixth and la&s;t Puppy I re&s;olv'd not to kill at all if I could help it, it being &s;o like the Dam, and wou'd always be with me if it
<PB N="18" REF="96">
could, when the others would only play about the Hole where they lay.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I began to find the Weather cold, and &s;o re&s;olv'd to &s;et &s;ail in my Boat, with my two Companions, my Bitch and Puppy; and on the 1&s;t of <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> after being on the Rock from <HI>May</HI> the 30th, I &s;et &s;ail with the Wind about N. E. a middling Gale, and &s;teering with my other Oar; for you mu&s;t know my Boat-Hook was my Ma&s;t, and a piece of &s;lit Wood that I &s;av'd from the Fire was my Yard; &s;o that I cou'd make &s;hift to ply it to Windward upon Occa&s;ion, but was re&s;olv'd to &s;ail before the Wind till I di&s;cover'd Land; but my Boat being pretty large, and my Sail but &s;mall, I could not make my Way as I might have done with a Sail fitted to the Boat, &s;o that I could not di&s;cover Land that Night, but &s;ail'd on till about Midnight; then I was &s;o fatigu'd, that in Spite of my &s;elf, I was oblig'd to lie along in the Boat, and fell a&s;leep, and &s;lept till I was awaken'd by a Fi&s;herman in a Boat, whom I under&s;tood not; but found by his Dialect to be a <HI>Dane.</HI> I gave him
<PB N="19" REF="97">
to under&s;tand my Condition, by &s;peaking and Signs together, which he &s;eem'd to be &s;orry for by beating his Brea&s;t, and &s;haking his Head.</P>
<P>He carry'd me a-Shore to a Village, where they made very much of me, and gave me Cloaths; but I would not &s;tir without my Dogs. My Boat was &s;old, and the Money gave me, for my own U&s;e. After I had &s;tay'd at the Village three Days, I was carry'd to <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> the Factor for &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants, who made a Gather|ing for me which amounted to twenty &s;even Pounds in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money. The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> &s;ent a Per&s;on to me, who under&s;tood <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> very well, and took down the Particulars of my Voy|age in the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Language, that I &s;aw afterwards printed there; but no one could ever fix upon the Rock that I liv|ed on. One &s;aid it was &s;uch a One, ano|ther &s;uch a One; and &s;ome conjectur'd it to be a Part of the Main Land of <HI>Swe|den,</HI> which I &s;hould have found if I had ventured further when hinder'd by the Fog.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="98">
But I forgot to tell you, that by Printing this Account, a Man came to de|mand his Boat, that he &s;aid he had lo&s;t by the Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of a Boy, to whom he had given it in Charge; who neglecting to fa&s;ten it on Shore, it drove out to Sea, and came where I had the good Fortune to meet with it, or rather guided by the Eye of Providence, to be the Means or In&s;trument of &s;aving my Life; which, but for that, I mu&s;t have inevitably lo&s;t. The Fi&s;herman that own'd the Boat, had a New One given him in the Room on't, and to the Value of five Pounds for the Things it contain'd.</P>
<P>The Gentleman that was order'd to take the Notes mention'd above, brought me a Hundred <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Guineas, collect|ed from Merchants and Gentlemen of the City. The King likewi&s;e order'd me a Hundred more from his Privy Pur&s;e; &s;o that in <HI>November</HI> the 18th, I went on Board an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, call'd the <HI>Happy,</HI> Captain <HI>John Gib&s;on</HI> Commander. We immediately &s;et &s;ail for <HI>London,</HI> and ar|riv'd at <HI>Debtford, December</HI> the 25th, being <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s-Day,</HI> 1688; but finding
<PB N="21" REF="99">
Things out of Order in <HI>England,</HI> I thought it was no Place to &s;ettle in. So <HI>January</HI> the 1&s;t I took Hor&s;e for <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and from thence embark'd for <HI>Cork,</HI> where I had &s;ome &s;mall Effects, and happily arriv'd there, <HI>January</HI> the 14th; where I was welcom'd from Death, by all my Friends.</P>
<P>But I forgot one Thing which happen|ed to me at <HI>Copenhagen.</HI> Dining with the Gentleman that &s;poke <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> very well, and &s;everal other <HI>Danes,</HI> I hap|pened to drink to him in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> with, <HI>Sir, My humble Service to you,</HI> and ask'd him if he would <HI>Pledge me:</HI> Upon which, he told me, I mu&s;t never mention Pledg|ing among <HI>Danes;</HI> for, added he, 'tis the greate&s;t Affront you can put upon 'em. How &s;o, Sir, &s;ays I? Why, &s;ays he, I know 'tis your Cu&s;tom in <HI>England,</HI> but if you all knew the Meaning of it, you would &s;urely aboli&s;h it. Whereupon, I pre&s;s'd him to tell me the Foundation of that Cu&s;tom, according to his Notion. Why &s;ays he, when the <HI>Danes</HI> invaded <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and got the Better of the Natives, they us'd often to eat and drink toge|ther;
<PB N="22" REF="100">
but &s;till allowing the <HI>Danes</HI> to be their Ma&s;ters: And very often, upon &s;ome Pique or Intere&s;t, they us'd even to &s;tab 'em when they were lifting the Cup to their Mouths. Upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> being frequently murder'd in this Man|ner, they contriv'd at la&s;t when they were at Meals, or drinking with the <HI>Danes,</HI> to &s;ay to their next Neighbour, <HI>Here's to you;</HI> upon which, the other cry'd, <HI>I'll pledge you:</HI> Which was as much as to &s;ay, he would be his Surety, or Pledge, while the other drank; and accordingly the other would guard him while he drank. When done, the other would drink; and then he that drank before, was to &s;tand his Pledge likewi&s;e. Nay, it came to be &s;uch a Cu&s;tom at la&s;t, that when one <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> came into the Com|pany of &s;everal <HI>Danes,</HI> he wou'd &s;ay in taking up his Cup, to his next Neigh|bour, Will you Pledge me, with an Em|pha&s;is; upon the others an&s;w'ring he would, he might drink without Fear.</P>
<P>After &s;taying the Winter at <HI>Cork,</HI> I de|&s;ign'd to embark with Captain <HI>Clarke,</HI> on Board the Ship <HI>Gilliflower,</HI> and according|ly
<PB N="23" REF="101">
we &s;et out from <HI>Cork, April</HI> the 23d, 1689. for <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> and &s;o for <HI>Virginia;</HI> we arriv'd at <HI>Bo&s;ton June</HI> the 3d, having a quick Pa&s;&s;age. After having done our Bu&s;ine&s;s there, we &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Virginia.</HI> We doubled <HI>Cape-Cod</HI> without any Danger; but one Night a Storm ro&s;e, that flung us on Shore upon the Main, within &s;ix Leagues of <HI>Cape-Charles,</HI> where our Men were all &s;av'd, but in a poor Condition. Our Ship ly|ing upon the Sands a Furlong from Shore, fourteen out of twenty of our Men that could &s;wim, went into the Long-Boat, and went on Board the Ship, to get &s;ome Nece&s;&s;aries; as &s;oon as they had got what they wanted, they came towards the Shore again; but the Boat being deeply Laden, could not come nigh e|nough to Shore to unload, &s;o that they re&s;olv'd to go farther to &s;eek for deeper Water, and bid us follow along the Shore, which we did; but they doubling a Point of Land, we lo&s;t Sight of 'em: However we follow'd on &s;till, when going over a little Swamp, we perceiv'd &s;everal <HI>Indi|dians</HI> in a Wood on our Right-Hand.
<PB N="24" REF="102">
Whereupon we began to be in a de&s;pe|rate Fright, but &s;till we march'd on; when coming to the Skirt of the Wood, they let fly their Arrows at us, which kill'd one of our Companions, and wounded two more, one in the Arm, and the o|ther in the Side of the Neck; as for my part, I &s;till remain'd unhurt, but had an Arrow &s;ticking in the Sleeve of my Watch-coat. After the <HI>Indians</HI> had fir'd, they ran to us with incredible Swiftne&s;s, whereupon (having no Weapons) we kneel'd down to 'em, and implor'd their Mercy. One among 'em &s;poke <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pretty well, who &s;aid, You <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> White-Men, we will kill you to be re|veng'd of your Brothers at <HI>I ame&s;town,</HI> who kill us many <HI>Indians;</HI> we will take you to our <HI>Werowance,</HI> (i. e. <HI>King,)</HI> and he will order us to burn you, where we will drink your Blood, and feed up|on your Fle&s;h. They hurry'd us along that Night at lea&s;t twenty Miles up in the Country, and next Morning brought us to their Village, where was their <HI>We|rowance,</HI> &s;ick in his Cabin; but hearing of our coming, he ro&s;e up, and with &s;e|veral
<PB N="25" REF="103">
of his Officers (who are call'd <HI>Cock|oroo&s;es)</HI> came towards us. After he had examin'd the <HI>Indians</HI> (as we &s;uppo&s;e) how we were taken, he order'd a great Fire to be made, and had us all ty'd to one Stake fix'd in the Earth; but we were no &s;ooner ty'd, and the Signal given for firing the Wood about us, but we were unty'd and brought back to the Tent, to &s;tay, as we were inform'd, till the next Day, till more <HI>Indians</HI> could come to be Spectators of our Tragedy. They had &s;trip'd us Naked, and in my Breeches-Pocket had found my Box of In&s;truments, which they examin'd very narrowly, and ask'd which of us it belong'd to? When they were inform'd it was mine, I was im|mediately &s;ent for before the <HI>Werowance,</HI> who ask'd me by his Interpreter, the Name and U&s;e of every In&s;trument, which I inform'd him: When he came to my Lancets, and being inform'd they were to Bleed, he ask'd in a great Pa&s;&s;i|on, if I was the Murderer of the <HI>Indians</HI> that were taken by the <HI>Engli&s;h?</HI> But when I let him know it was to let Blood in many Di&s;tempers, for Ea&s;e for the Bo|dy,
<PB N="26" REF="104">
and that we were Strangers to tho&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that kill'd their <HI>Indians,</HI> he abated of his Anger, and ask'd me if I could &s;how how I let Blood, which I told him I could, if any one wanted it, and was not well. Whereupon the <HI>We|rowance</HI> &s;aid he was not very well; but he would have me try upon one of my Companions, before he would let me Bleed him. I told his Interpreter that he &s;hould tell him I would feel his Pul&s;e, that I might know whether 'twas proper to let him Blood or no; Feel his Pul&s;e! what's that? &s;ays the Interpreter, and thought I meant &s;omething el&s;e; where|upon I took him by the Hand, and &s;how|ed him what I meant. When the Inter|preter had &s;atisfy'd him with what I &s;aid, he beckon'd me to him, and held out his Hand, which I felt, and found he was in a high Fever; I told the Inter|preter that he mu&s;t be let Blood, for his Indi&s;po&s;ition was a Fever, and explain'd his Di&s;temper, which he finding to agree with his Condition, &s;eem'd to be mighti|ly pleas'd; but he would have me Bleed &s;ome one of my Companions before him;
<PB N="27" REF="105">
I pitch'd upon one that it would not injure, and Bled him upon the Ground till he had Bled enough, and then ty'd up his Arm. The <HI>Werowance</HI> and the re&s;t of the <HI>Indians</HI> were amaz'd to &s;ee him Bleed &s;uch a Quantity, and ask'd me if he mu&s;t Bleed as much? I told 'em, yes, or rather more; but that I wou'd have &s;omething to &s;ave the Blood, be|cau&s;e I could make a better Judgment of the Cau&s;e of his Di&s;temper. Where|upon they brought me a <HI>Calliba&s;h,</HI> which I &s;uppos'd might hold a Quart; and upon this, I ty'd up his Arm, and let him Bleed till I had taken about Sixteen Ounces from him, &s;o ty'd up his Arm again. When I had done, he wanted to go into his Hammock to &s;leep; but I told him he mu&s;t not go to re&s;t till Night, which he comply'd with. The next Day he was much bet|ter, and &s;ent for me again, from the Place where they had kept us waking all Night, by Singing and Dancing round us; and if any of us offer'd to &s;leep, they would jogg us and hinder us. When I came to him I unbound his Arm,
<PB N="28" REF="106">
and he looking at the Orifice, and find|ing it clos'd, was more amaz'd than be|fore; then he made his Interpreter ask me concerning his Blood, which was cor|rupted; and when I told him if I had not Bled him, he would &s;oon have dy'd, he got up, and made me &s;it down upon a Mat which lay in his Cabbin, and told me by his Interpreter, if I would &s;tay with him, he would &s;ave both me and my Companions; if we would Fight a|gain&s;t the <HI>Whites,</HI> and Marry <HI>Indian</HI> Wo|men, that &s;hould be allotted us. I told him I would ask my Companions, who rejoyc'd at the Propo&s;als; (and tho' all marry'd before) yet they made no Scru|ple of having another Wife. As for my &s;elf, (tho' not marry'd,) I did not much care for &s;uch a tawny Rib, therefore told the <HI>Werowance,</HI> none of our Profe&s;&s;ion ever marry'd; he being well &s;atisfy'd with this An&s;wer, &s;par'd all our Lives. For my part I had a Hou&s;e allotted me to my &s;elf, that is a Place about the Height of one Story with us, and cover'd with the Barks of Trees; the Fire-Place is in the Middle of the Hou&s;e, and all the Chim|ney
<PB N="29" REF="107">
is the Door. The Country is gene|rally pretty even, and agrees very well with an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution. I need not de&s;cribe the Climate, being I &s;up|po&s;e you all know the Nature of it as well as I. All the <HI>Indians</HI> that ever I &s;aw, were well Limb'd, and near Six Foot high.</P>
<P>The Marriages were made the next Day without much Ceremony, they were only join'd by their Prie&s;ts, without any Que&s;tion on either Side, and &s;o carry'd Home to their &s;everal Tents. All the while I was here, they were making Preparations to go again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> One Day I was &s;ent for, and ordered to feel the Pul&s;e of the King; after I had done, he asked me if I could tell any thing of the Affairs of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> by feeling the Pul&s;e; but I told him, that was impo&s;&s;ible, without I was with 'em in Per&s;on: Whereupon, the King asked me if I would go to the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> and come to him again, and give him a true Account of 'em, but &s;ays he, you mu&s;t leave your <HI>Sagamore,</HI> (mean|ing my Box of In&s;truments) behind you.

We went down the River that the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Kuskarra</HI> Ri|ver, till we came to <HI>Che&s;apeack-Bay;</HI> then we row'd in our Canoe pa&s;t <HI>Ru&s;&s;els</HI> I&s;|lands, and made toward <HI>Cape,</HI> or <HI>Poynt-Comfort;</HI> but coming about a League or thereabouts near the I&s;land, a Boat came down the River, and upon what Account I can't tell; but they fir'd a Mu&s;quet, which being heard by the <HI>Indians,</HI> they immediately jump'd Over-board, and &s;wam back again to Shore. I was not much concerned I mu&s;t own, for there

was no Danger of their being drowned; for mo&s;t <HI>Indians</HI> &s;wim like Fi&s;hes.

<P>Now think with your &s;elf, Mr. <HI>Falconer,</HI> whether we need doubt the Providence of God in helping us from this I&s;land? There's nothing here like the Hard&s;hips I have undergone, and yet have been hap|pily freed from; and therefore you need not de&s;pair. De&s;pair is the Frenzy of the Mind, and ought to be avoided, by having a true Notion of the Pow|er we &s;erve. Upon this I happen'd to &s;mile, but was mightily check'd by Mr. <HI>Randal,</HI> who asked me with a clouded
<PB N="32" REF="110">
Countenance, what I &s;mil'd at? I reply|ed his Story might have had the &s;ame Effect upon &s;ome old Women, (if it were in Print) that the Sufferings of our Savi|our had upon a Per&s;on in Years. What mean you by that, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Randal?</HI> Why, Ill tell you, but I would not have you angry at it, for I really believe every thing you have &s;aid to me. But a Re|verend Divine once at <HI>Stamford</HI> in <HI>Lin|coln&s;hire,</HI> was preaching a Sermon upon Chri&s;t's Pa&s;&s;ion, where he expatiated on the many Sufferings, and what our Sa|viour underwent to redeem us Mortals from the Cur&s;e that was laid upon us: An old Woman (one of the Auditors) took the Par&s;on by the Sleeve as he went out of the Church, and &s;aid to him, Indeed, Sir, you have made a very feeling Ser|mon, which has mov'd me very much, and more e&s;pecially to ask you a Que|&s;tion, or two. Say on, good Woman, &s;ays the Par&s;on. Pray then, Sir, (&s;ays &s;he) how long is it ago &s;ince this Matter hap|pen'd? Almo&s;t Seventeen Hundred Years ago. And how far off?

Three or Four Thou&s;and Miles from hence. Alack aday! cry'd the Woman, I'm glad on't; Why &s;o, &s;ays the Par&s;on? Becau&s;e (added &s;he) 'tis &s;o long ago, and &s;o far off, I hope in God it is not true. As to your own Belief, (Mr. <HI>Falconer,</HI> &s;aid he,) I leave it to your &s;elf; but I don't like je&s;t|ing with Sacred Things: The old Wo|man's Ignorance was Compa&s;&s;ion; your Knowledge &s;eems to be profane. I have known a great many airy young Fellows that have talk'd idly on &s;uch Things, to make People have an Opinion of their Wit; but yet, I believe, even in the ve|ry Time of their Utterance, their Con|&s;cience told 'em, the very doing what was not plea&s;ing to God or Man. I real|ly took Mr. <HI>Randal</HI>'s Way of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf very kindly, and as I ought; for there appear'd &s;o much Sincerity and Can|dour in all that he &s;aid, that it would move any one that had a Sen&s;e of Hea|ven or Humane Nature. Therefore I beg'd his Pardon, and was heartily &s;orry if I had &s;aid ought that might any ways of|fend him; which he freely forgave. Af|ter we had &s;pent the Night in Reflecti|on

of what had pa&s;t; the next Morn|ing, we (after imploring the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Almighty) went to Work to clear the Sand from our Ve&s;&s;el: which we con|tinued working on, for 16 Days toge|ther, re&s;ting only on <HI>Sunday,</HI> which at la&s;t we effected. We had thrown up the Sand on each &s;ide, down from our Ve&s;&s;el quite to the Surface of the Water, when it was lowe&s;t. Now the next Thing we had to do, was to get Poles to put under our Ve&s;&s;el to Launch her out, which we got from the <HI>Burton</HI> Wood, but with much difficulty, being we were forced to cut a great many before we could get them that were fit for our Purpo&s;e. After we had done this, we returned God Thanks for our Succe&s;s hitherto, and on the Day fol|ing, re&s;olved (God willing) to thru&s;t off our Ve&s;&s;el into the Water, but was pre|vented by Mr. <HI>Randal</HI>'s being taken Ill of a Fever, occa&s;ioned (as we &s;uppo&s;e) by his great Fatigue in working to free our Ship from the Sand, wherein he &s;pared no Pains, for to encourage us as much by his Actions as his Words, even be|yond

his Strength. The Concern we were all in upon this, occa&s;ioned our delay in not getting our Ve&s;&s;el out, be|&s;ides one Hand out of Five, was a weak|ning our Strength. Mr <HI>Randal</HI> never thought of his In&s;truments, till now, which he wanted to let him&s;elf Blood, but not feeling them about his Cloaths, we &s;uppos'd they might have been over|look'd in the Ve&s;&s;el, &s;o I ran immediate|ly to &s;ee if I could find them; and getting up the Side, my very Weight pull'd her down to the Sand; which had certainly bruis'd me to Death, if I had not by the Appointment of divine Providence &s;unk into the Hollow that we had made by throwing the Sand from the Ship. I crept out in a great Fright, and ran to my Companions, who with much ado got her upright, and afterwards we fixed &s;ome &s;pare Oars on each &s;ide, to keep her up from falling again. For the Pie|ces of Wood that we had placed under her were greas'd to facilitate her &s;liping into the Water, and we had dig'd the the Sand &s;o entirely from her, that &s;he re&s;ted only on 'em, which occa&s;ioned

When we were enter'd into the Ve&s;&s;el, and found our Endeavours to find the Box of In&s;tru|ments fruitle&s;s, we were all mightily con|cerned, for we verily believed that bleed|ing would have cured him; nay even he him&s;elf &s;aid, that if he could be let Blood, he was certain his Fever would a|bate, and he &s;hould be ea&s;ier; yet to &s;ee with what a perfect Re&s;ignation he &s;ub|mitted to the Will of Heaven, it would have in&s;pired one with a true Knowledge of the Being good Men enjoy after a Di&s;&s;olution from this painful Life. He was &s;till wor&s;e and wor&s;e; but yet &s;o Patient in his Sufferings, that perfectly amaz'd us all. He continued in this Manner a whole Week, without ta&s;ting any Thing but Water-gruel ill made, for what little Oatmeal we had, was &s;ower. When we &s;aw by the Cour&s;e of Nature,

He &s;eeing me weep, call'd me with a faint Voice towards him; and when I was near him, he made me &s;it down by him. After &s;everal kind Expre&s;&s;ions, which made my Tears flow more plentifully, he &s;aid to me, Mr. <HI>Fal|coner,</HI> if you grieve for me, dry your Tears, I de&s;ire nothing but your Prayers. I am going to pay a Debt incumbent on me by Nature, and a Debt that mu&s;t be paid, which was contracted at my Birth, and Death will not admit of any Eva&s;ion; all Mortals owe the &s;ame Acknowledg|ment, but &s;ome &s;quander away that Sub|&s;tance which &s;hould be freely paid when call'd for. How happy are they that provide again&s;t &s;uch a Creditor, that may come at any Hour of Day or Night, and lawfully demand his due? Here is no Shuffling as in worldly Matters, no putting off the important Vi&s;iter; there|fore as we are &s;ure he will call upon us,

'tis good to be always provided again&s;t the Time. How happy are hone&s;t Minds, when they have provided to &s;atisfy their worldly Creditors; they then live in a Contentment of Mind, peculiar to an hone&s;t Heart: But what mu&s;t be &s;aid for the la&s;t Debt, upon which depends the Welfare of the Soul, our doing well or ill hereafter, is it not of the utmo&s;t Importance? Therefore as I am endea|vouring to pay that Debt, who&s;e utmo&s;t Limit will &s;oon expire, help me by your Prayers to fini&s;h what I hope I have well begun, and as Friend's Advice, prepare to make up your Accounts to Heaven, for you know not how &s;oon they may be call'd for; be&s;ides you will have one le&s;s to eat of the Provi&s;ion is left. After this, being tir'd with &s;peaking &s;o much toge|ther, he turn'd to re&s;t him&s;elf, but his Fever was &s;o violent, he could take no ea&s;e in Body, tho' tranquil in Mind. So finding we could not expect his Life, we pray'd for a &s;peedy and a painle&s;s Relea&s;e from it. After this we gave him &s;ome Water (which he often beg'd for in vain) to cool his Mouth. When he had
<PB N="39" REF="117">
drank it, he &s;aid he found him&s;elf a lit|tle ea&s;ier, and the Pain and Burning &s;omething abated, which we took as a lightning before Death, or as the Spirits collected together to make their la&s;t fruitle&s;s Efforts.</P>
<P>When he found him&s;elf ju&s;t upon the Point of expiring, he made this &s;hort Prayer, which was &s;o imprinted in my Memory, that I &s;hall never forget it: O Almighty Creator of Heaven and Earth, who&s;e all-&s;eeing Eye looks into the in|mo&s;t Corner of the Heart! pardon my Offences, which I heartily repent of, and rely upon the infinite Grace of thy wont|ed Mercy to ab&s;olve me of all my pa&s;t Crimes, through the Merits of my Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Then lifting up his Hands and Eyes to Heaven expi|red, with the Happine&s;s of continuing in his right Sen&s;es in &s;uch a Fever, which is almo&s;t always attended with a Fren|zy.</P>
<P>After our Sorrow for his Death was &s;omething abated, we con&s;ulted how to bury him. Mr. <HI>Middleton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Mu&s;|grave</HI> were for &s;ewing him in his Ham|mock
<PB N="40" REF="118">
and throwing him into the Sea; But Mr. <HI>White</HI> and my &s;elf were for burying him on the Land, which they a|greed to; &s;o we dig'd the Hole which I de&s;igned for my Well, Seven Foot long and Seven deep, and return'd him to Earth from whence he came. Upon the Bark of the Tree that &s;haded his Grave, I wrote this Epitaph.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes">Under this Tree lies the Body of <HI>Thomas Randal,</HI> Gent. born in the Ci|ty of <HI>Cork, Anno Domini</HI> 1641. who was thrown a&s;hore with <HI>Richard White, William Mu&s;grave,</HI> and <HI>Ralph Middle|ton,</HI> both of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to the Con&s;ola|tion of <HI>Richard Falconer</HI> of <HI>Bruton</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> who was unfortunately ca&s;t on Shore before them on the 18th of of <HI>September</HI> 1699. yet received from their Conver&s;ation a Mitigation of his own Misfortune. Who&s;e Chance it is ever to read the&s;e Lines, pay a Tear to the Memory of <HI>Thomas Randal,</HI> and endeavour to make as good an End as he did, who died a Natural Death on <HI>Friday December</HI> the 21&s;t 1699, in his perfect Mind, and a true Notion of the
<PB N="41" REF="119">
Power of God to pardon all his Faults, who&s;e Failings were corrected by a &s;in|cere Penitence, dying every Day he lived.</Q>
<P>This took me up a whole Tree. Mr. <HI>Randal</HI> made no Will; yet I claimed his Dog, being the Whelp of the Bitch he found upon the Rock which he was thrown upon in the <HI>Baltick,</HI> the Bitch being Dead &s;ome Years before. We were forced to tie him up after we had buried Mr. <HI>Randal,</HI> for with his Feet he would &s;crape Holes in the Grave two Foot deep, and howl prodigiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>After this we prepared once more to Launch our Ve&s;&s;el; but fir&s;t we put on Board what Provi&s;ion we had left, and all the Things that we took from thence. Mr. <HI>Randal</HI>'s Death gave me (with the others Permi&s;&s;ion) a Title to a Bed, which I wanted before. So that I took up the Cabin which was alloted me, and laid on Board every Night: And now we bent our Thoughts intirely on our Ve&s;&s;el, and on <HI>Monday</HI> the 31&s;t of <HI>December</HI> launch'd her out into the Sea, and de|&s;ign'd to &s;et Sail the next Day. After we had fix'd her fa&s;t with two Anchors,
<PB N="42" REF="120">
and a Hal&s;er on Shore, we went on Board to Dine and make our&s;elves Merry, which we did very heartily, and to add to our Mirth, we made a large Can of Punch, which we never attempted to do before, being we had but one Bottle of Lime Juice in all, and was what (indeed) we de&s;ign'd for this Occa&s;ion; in &s;hort the Punch ran down &s;o merrily, that we were all in a drunken Condition; but when it was all gone, we re&s;olved to go to re&s;t: But all I could do, could not per&s;uade 'em to lie on Board that Night in their Cabins, (yet without a Bed;) but they would venture, tho' they were obliged to &s;wim a hundred Yards before they could wade to Shore, but however they got &s;afe, which I knew by their hollowing and rejoicing.</P>
<P>Having brought my Bed on Board, I went to re&s;t very contentedly, which I did till next Morning: But oh! Horror! when I had dre&s;t my &s;elf, and going on Deck, to call my Companions to come on Board to Dine, which was intended over Night, and afterwards to go on Shore, and bring our Sails and Yards on
<PB N="43" REF="121">
Board, and make to Sea as fa&s;t as we could, I could not &s;ee any Land, which &s;o overcame me on the Suddain, that I &s;unk down on the Deck, without Sen&s;e or Motion: How long I continu'd &s;o, I can't tell, but I awak'd full of the Sen&s;e of my lamentable Condition, and ten thou|&s;and Times (&s;pight of my Re&s;olution to forbear) curs'd my unhappy Stars, that had brought me to that deplorable State. O Wretch that I am! what will my unhappy Fate do with me, is any one's Condition equal to mine? (I would cry) But 'tis a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment, in not rendering to God the Tribute due for his Mercies, that we had hitherto known. In&s;tead of coming on Board to be Frolick|&s;ome and Merry, we &s;hould have given Thanks to him, that gave us the Ble&s;&s;ing of thinking we were no longer &s;ubject to &s;uch Hard&s;hips, that we might probably have undergone, if we had been detain'd longer on that I&s;land. If poor Mr. <HI>Ran|dal</HI> had remain'd among us, this Misfor|tune had not happened. He by his wi&s;e and prudent Care and Conduct, would have prevented this unlucky Accident. What
<PB N="44" REF="122">
mu&s;t my poor Companions think that are left in a more mi&s;erable Condition than my &s;elf, if it be po&s;&s;ible. I have no Com|pa&s;s, neither am I of my &s;elf capable of ruling the Ve&s;&s;el in a Calm, much le&s;s if there &s;hould a Storm happen, which are too frequent in this Climate.</P>
<P>After I had vented my Grief in a Tor|rent of Words and Tears, I began to think how the Ve&s;&s;el &s;hould have gone to Sea without my Knowledge; and by Remem|brance of the Matter the Night before, found by our Eagerne&s;s and fatal Care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, we had forgot to fa&s;ten our Ca|bles to the Geers, and pulling up the Hal&s;er that we had fa&s;ten'd to one of the <HI>Burton</HI> Trees on Shore, perceiv'd that the Force of the Ve&s;&s;el had pull'd the Tree out of the Earth. Then I too late found that a Hurricane had ro&s;e when I was &s;ound a&s;leep, and &s;tupify'd by too much Liquor, and carry'd off the Ve&s;&s;el. This Reflection wounded me deeper than be|fore, which I follow'd with Cur&s;es on that Liquor that &s;teals away our Sen&s;es, and makes wor&s;e than Bea&s;ts of Humane Creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="123">
Now I began to call upon him that hears us in the Time of Trouble, even when the Wind blows loude&s;t, who&s;e Nod can &s;hake the Frame of Earth from off its Ba&s;is; and with a Heart &s;incere, and vicious Thoughts corrected, I &s;ent my Soul in Penitential Words and Tears before his Throne of Mercy, imploring a &s;peedy Ending of my Life or Troubles; when I began to be &s;omething better con|tented in my Mind, and thought of &s;u|&s;taining Nature almo&s;t &s;pent, with the Fatigue and Grieving: One great Com|fort I had of my Side, which my poor (former) wretched Companions wanted, that was Provi&s;ion in Plenty, and fre&s;h Water; &s;o that when I began to con&s;ider coolly, I found I had not that Cau&s;e to complain which they had, who were left on a Barren I&s;land, without any other Provi&s;ion than that very &s;ame Diet which I was forc'd to take up with, when fir&s;t thrown on Shore; that is, the Boobies, who&s;e Numbers were mightily dimini&s;h'd, before we de&s;ign'd to leave the I&s;land.</P>
<P>What made me mo&s;t unea&s;y, was to think what my Companions could judge
<PB N="46" REF="124">
of me, whether they &s;hould take it for De&s;ign or Chance; but then I &s;till'd that Thought, by knowing they mu&s;t needs &s;ee that the Tree was forc'd away with Violence beyond the Strength of Man. Be&s;ides, I had another &s;mall Comfort, that was the Company of my Dog, which lay on Board with me, which I us'd to talk to as if he were a rational Creature; and the poor Creature wou'd &s;tand and &s;tare me in the Face, as if he were &s;en&s;ible of what I &s;aid to him. It was a very hand|&s;ome Creature, of the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Kind; but very good-natured, and would often go to the Cabbin where I lay, which was that of his old Ma&s;ter's, and whine migh|tily.</P>
<P>I remain'd to&s;s'd upon the Sea for a Fortnight without di&s;covering Land; for the Weather continu'd very calm, but yet &s;o hazy that I could not perceive the Sun for &s;everal Days. One Day &s;earch|ing for &s;ome Linnen that I had drop'd under the Sacking of my Bed, (for I did not lie in a Hammock) I found an old Glove with 75 Pieces of Eight in't, which I took and &s;ew'd in the Wa&s;te-Band
<PB N="47" REF="125">
of my Breeches, for fear I &s;hould want it &s;ome time or other. I made no Scruple of taking it, for I was well a&s;&s;u|red it did belong to poor Mr. <HI>Randal.</HI> Be&s;ide I had heard the other People &s;ay, that they were &s;ure he had Money &s;ome|where; and after his Death we &s;earch'd for it, but could not find any.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> the 20th I di&s;cover'd a Sail to Leeward of me, but &s;he bore away &s;o fa&s;t, that there was not any Hope of Succour from her, and I had not any Thing to di&s;tingui&s;h me; and I &s;uppos'd tho' I could &s;ee them, yet they could not &s;ee me by Rea&s;on of my want of Sail, which would have made me the more con&s;picuous. The next Day I di&s;cover|ed Land, about &s;ix Leagues to the S. W. of me, which I ob&s;erv'd my Ve&s;&s;el did not come nigh, but coa&s;ted along Shore; but I was well a&s;&s;ured it was the Pro|vince of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> and was the Place we came from; now all my Fear was that I &s;hould fall into their Hands, who would make me do the Work of a Slave; but even that I thought was better than to live in con|tinual
<PB N="48" REF="126">
Fear of Storms and Tempe&s;ts, or Shipwreck.</P>
<P>I coa&s;ted along in this Manner for two or three Days, and at la&s;t di&s;cover'd Land right a-head, which I was very glad of; but yet mix'd with &s;ome Fear, in not knowing what Treatment I &s;hould have. I began now to think of &s;ome E|va&s;ion, and not to tell 'em the Truth, of belonging to the Logwood Ve&s;&s;el, but re&s;olv'd to tell 'em that we were taken by a <HI>French</HI> Privateer, and after being rumag'd, were turn'd off as u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> the 30th, I made the Bay and Town of <HI>Franci&s;co di Campeche,</HI> as it prov'd afterwards, and was almo&s;t upon it before I was met by any Thing of a Ship, or a Boat; but at la&s;t two Canoes came on Board with one <HI>Spaniard</HI> and &s;ix <HI>Indians,</HI> who were much &s;urpriz'd when they under&s;tood my Condition by &s;peak|ing broken <HI>French,</HI> which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> under&s;tood. They immediately carry'd me on Shore, and from thence to the Governor, who was at Dinner; they would have had me &s;taid till he had din'd; but he hearing of me, commanded
<PB N="49" REF="127">
me to come in, where he was at Dinner with &s;everal Gentlemen, and two La|dies; and tho' 'tis very rare any one &s;ees the Women, yet they did not offer to Veil them&s;elves.

<P>The Chief Town of the Province of <HI>Ju|catan,</HI> lies twelve Leagues from the Sea on either Side, which is a Bi&s;hop's See, and the Re&s;ident of the Governor of this Province. <HI>Valladolid</HI> is the &s;econd City; and <HI>Campeche</HI> the third; yet tho' but the third reckon'd, it far exceeds the re&s;t, for Riches and Magnificence. It is a well &s;ituated neat built Town, and by Com|putation contains near Two Thou&s;and Hou&s;es. It is well fortified both by Art and Nature: By the former in a &s;trong, well built, neat Ca&s;tle, that contains a Hundred Bra&s;s Cannon, and &s;everal Mor|tars; and the latter by a Ridge of Hills, that runs all along the Side of the City. There is in the Ca&s;tle a very neat Piaz|za,
<PB N="50" REF="128">
con&s;i&s;ting of about Thirty high Arches. This Town has the chiefe&s;t Trade; for from this Place, the other Ci|ties and Towns are furni&s;hed with all Nece&s;&s;aries that come from the <HI>Havana</HI> and other Places in <HI>America;</HI> and like|wi&s;e from <HI>Old Spain.</HI> Yet for all their Power, Riches and Strength, Capt <HI>Par|ker,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> with one Ship, and a &s;mall Bark, and who&s;e whole Crew contain'd but a Hundred and Forty Men, Landed in the Middle of the Day, and in Spite of all their Forces, which were Two Hundred Hor&s;e, and Five Hundred Foot, took the Place, with the Gover|nor and &s;everal other Per&s;ons of Quality; together with a rich Ship laden with In|gots and &s;everal other valuable Ladings, before they knew of the City's being ta|ken. This Province of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> contains in Compa&s;s Nine Hundred Miles, and is &s;ituated between Eighteen and Twenty Degrees, Northern Latitude. The Air is very hot, and not altogether &s;o Whole&s;ome as &s;ome other Parts of <HI>Ame|rica</HI> are. The Di&s;tempers that reign here, are mo&s;tly Fluxes and Feavers, which
<PB N="51" REF="129">
carry off Abundance of New Comers. This Province was fir&s;t di&s;cover'd by <HI>Fer|dinando Cortez,</HI> among his Conque&s;ts of <HI>New Spain;</HI> and tho' not altogether &s;o Fruitful, yet by the Indu&s;try of the In|habitants, 'tis as Rich as any of the o|ther Provinces of <HI>New Spain;</HI> for they are mo&s;t either Merchants or Trade&s;men: And 'tis the Vulgar Opinion, that the&s;e People are more hard and barbarous than any other Part of the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies;</HI> yet, for my own part, I receiv'd more Ci|vility by 'em, than if I had been among my own Friends in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Tradition here among the Inhabitants, that they us'd a Ceremony much like our Bapti&s;m, and which had in their Language, the Term of Regene|ration, or Second Birth; which they thought to be the Seed or Groundwork of all good and ju&s;t Things; and after being initiated, they were certain it was not in the Power of the Evil Spirit to hurt 'em in Body or Goods: Neither were they permitted to Marry, without fir&s;t taking that Order upon 'em, which they us'd to di&s;tingui&s;h by an <HI>O&s;triche</HI>'s
<PB N="52" REF="130">
Feather, larger and longer than any other they us&punc;d to wear for Ornaments upon their Heads.</P>
<P>They have another Tradition, that this Province of <HI>Jucatan</HI> was fir&s;t Inha|bited, and Cultivated by a White-Bearded People, that came from the Ea&s;t; after being to&s;s'd many Moons upon the Sea, and &s;uffering many Hard&s;hips for Want of Food and Fre&s;h Water, and other Ne|ce&s;&s;aries; yet reliev'd from Want and their Enemies, through the Power of the Deity they Wor&s;hip'd, who even com|manded the Sun to Shine, or not Shine; who made it Rain or dry Weather; who could heal Sickne&s;s, or &s;end Di&s;tempers; in &s;hort, a God that kept all the other petty Deities in Awe.</P>
<P>This Story, if true, &s;eems to confirm an old Tradition of our <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Chroni|cles, that tell us of one <HI>Madoc ap Owen,</HI> Son to <HI>Guineth,</HI> a Prince of that Coun|try, who was drove by &s;ome Di&s;gu&s;t, from his own Country, with &s;everal Com|panions, who after various Adventures at Sea, were driven on an unknown Land to the We&s;t, many Hundred Leagues,
<PB N="53" REF="131">
where they had Communication in a friendly Manner, with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and made a Settlement. Whereupon <HI>Madoc ap Owen</HI> return'd for <HI>Britain</HI> again, and got to the Number of Two Thou&s;and Men and Women, be&s;ides Children, which mix'd with the Natives, and left among 'em &s;everal of their Opinions and Man|ners; which they retain'd till the la&s;t, when <HI>Cortez</HI> &s;ubdu'd 'em; but now, by the Cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the Natives are almo&s;t extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>After they had fea&s;ted me for two or three Days, they &s;ent me about with &s;everal Officers appointed by the Gover|nour, to make a Gathering, which we did with Succe&s;s; for in Three Days we had got Seven Hundred and odd Pieces of Eight: And Two Merchants there, were at the Charge of fitting up my Bark, in Or|der to &s;end it for my poor Companions. When it was fini&s;h'd, they gave me &s;eve|ral Nece&s;&s;aries for my &s;elf and Compani|ons, to hearten us up; as &s;ome Bottles of fine Wines; Two Bottles of Citron-Water, for a Cordial; Chocolate, and &s;everal other u&s;eful Things: But the Dif|ficulty
<PB N="54" REF="132">
was to get Seamen to go with me: At la&s;t they remembered they had Five <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> that were Pri&s;oners there, and taken in the Bay of <HI>Campeche,</HI> upon Su&s;picion of Piracy, but nothing could be prov'd again&s;t 'em; which they Freed without any Ran&s;om: This did not look like Barbarity or Ill-Nature; for I receiv'd as much Humanity among 'em, as could be expected from any of the mo&s;t Civiliz'd Nations: But they have a greater Kindne&s;s for the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> than they have for their Neighbours the <HI>French,</HI> being the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are more open and ge|nerous, (they &s;ay) and don't u&s;e Strata|gems to deceive 'em, as the <HI>French</HI> do frequently; tho' they only pay 'em in their own Coin, for there is no Nation under the Sun more fruitful than the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> in Plottings and Ambu&s;cades, (as they call 'em) to deceive their Enemies; which yet they think lawful.</P>
<P>On <HI>February</HI> the 15th, 1700. we &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Campeche</HI> Bay, after paying my Acknowledgment to the generous Go|vernour, &amp;c. but having nothing to pre&s;ent him with worth Acceptance, but my <HI>Ovid,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="133">
I gave him that, which he took very kindly, and &s;aid he would prize it mightily, not only in having never a one, but in Re|membrance of me and my Misfortunes.</P>
<P>We ply'd it to Windward very briskly, and in Fifteen Days di&s;cover'd the I&s;les of the <HI>Alcranes;</HI> but we dur&s;t not go in within the Shoals, becau&s;e we were all ignorant of the Channel. So we ca&s;t Anchor, and hoi&s;ted out our Boat, with Two Men and my &s;elf, and made to Shore, where we found my Three Companions, but in a mi&s;erable Condition, and Mr. <HI>Mu&s;|grave</HI> &s;o faint and weak, that they ex|pected he could not live long.</P>
<P>When they awak'd the next Day, af|ter I was drove off in the Dark, they were all in De&s;pair, to find the Ve&s;&s;el gone, which they perceiv'd was occa&s;ion'd by a Hurricane, that they were a&s;&s;ur'd was violent, becau&s;e it had blown down their Tent, tho' without awaking 'em. But when they began to con&s;ider they had no Food, nor but very little fre&s;h Water, which was left in a Barrel with|out a Head in the Tent, their De&s;pair increas'd; but as no Pa&s;&s;ion can la&s;t long
<PB N="56" REF="134">
that's violent, it wore off with their Care for Su&s;tenance, which they diligently &s;earch'd for; but not finding any Quan|tity of Eggs, or Boobies, the dreadful Fear of Starving came into their Minds, with all its horrid Attendance. Now they imagin'd that all that happen'd to 'em, was, as I had thought, a Judgment of Divine Providence for the vile Sin of Drunkenne&s;s, when they &s;hould have ra|ther implor'd Heav'n's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in fur|thering 'em in their Delivery from the Place where they were.</P>
<P>They had been now Five Days with|out Eating or Drinking, not for Want of Stomachs, but Food, which they endea|vour'd to get, but all to no Purpo&s;e; for the Boobies were retir'd, either out of Fear, or Cu&s;tom, to &s;ome other Place&punc; Neither could they find one Egg more, and Weakne&s;s came &s;o fa&s;t upon 'em, with Hunger and Drought, that they were hardly able to crawl, &s;o they thought of nothing but dying; when at la&s;t they remember'd the Body of good Mr. <HI>Randal,</HI> that had been buried a Week, which they dug up, without be|ing

putrify'd; and that poor Wretch that help'd to &s;upport our Misfortunes when alive with his &s;age Advice, now was a Means of pre&s;erving their Lives, tho dead. They had by good Fortune left 'em a Tinder-Box in the Tent, (we hav|ing two) with which they &s;truck a Light, and made a Fire, then cut off &s;everal pie|ces of Fle&s;h of the Brawn of his Arms and Thighs, broil'd 'em on the Coals, tho' with a great deal of Reluctance; which was the Means of keeping Life and Soul together, till we came to relieve 'em from that deplorable Condition. Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> we brought to a little Life and Strength, by giving him &s;ome Citron-Water in &s;mall Quantities. When I &s;aw the Carca&s;s of my poor good Monitor lie for Food for Humane Creatures, my Horror at the Sight overcame my Rea&s;on, and I believe I &s;aid Things &s;hocking enough; however when I had calmly con&s;idered their Condition, I was ve|ry &s;orry for what I had &s;aid, and beg'd their Pardon. After we had refre&s;hed our &s;elves, we once more laid him in the Earth, having &s;ew'd his poor Bones in one of the Hammocks.</P>

I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I never think of that good Man, but Tears come into my Eyes, and Melancholy clouds all my Thoughts: For he was one who&s;e Cha|racter came up to all we cou'd de&s;ire in frail Men.

<P>He was a &s;ingle Man, or rather indeed, a Batchelor; for he had often told me, he cou'd not bear to Marry a Woman, to put her into Frights and Fears when the Wind blew hard, as every good Wife mu&s;t certainly be concern'd for the Danger of her Husband.

<P>He was an excellent Sailor, and knew mo&s;t Parts of the World perfectly well; under&s;tood <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and &s;eem'd to have a pretty good Know|ledge in the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue.

<P>We now were got on Board once again, in order to &s;ail as &s;oon as the Wind would ri&s;e, it being &s;tark Calm, and continu'd &s;o two Days; but at la&s;t it blew a little, and we weigh'd Anchor, and &s;tood out to Sea; but made but lit|tle Way.

of Pyracy. Whereupon a Thought came into my Head, that had e&s;cap'd me be|fore: I con&s;ider'd if the&s;e were really Pyrates, being Five to Four, they might be too powerful for us, and perhaps murder us. <HI>Franc Hood</HI> we had made our Cook, to dre&s;s our Provi&s;ion, which he under&s;tood a little. One Day we All Din'd together upon Deck, under our Awning, it being very calm Weather; an <HI>Awning</HI> is only a Sail fix'd at the Quarter-Deck, and carry'd over the <HI>Booms</HI> (that is, &s;pare Ma&s;ts that lie along from Quar|ter to Foreca&s;tle) to the Foreca&s;tle, to keep the Sun from our Heads: in Men of War, and great Ships, they have one made of &s;everal Kinds of hand&s;ome Stuff, for the Officers on the Quarter-Deck; be&s;ides another on the Main Deck, for the Common Sailors. One Day, as I &s;aid before, being at Dinner, for we All eat together; I ask'd the five Men, what was the Rea&s;on they were taken by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for Pyrates? Upon this they &s;eem'd nonplus'd, but <HI>Warren</HI> &s;oon re|cover'd him&s;elf, as well as the re&s;t, and &s;pake for the others, in this Manner: We
<PB N="62" REF="140">
embark'd on Board the Ship <HI>Bonaventure,</HI> in the <HI>Thames,</HI> bound for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where we made a pro&s;perous Voyage; but after taking in our Lading in our Way Home, we were overtaken by a Storm, in which our Ship was lo&s;t, and all the Men peri&s;h'd, but my &s;elf and Four Companions; who were &s;av'd in the Long-Boat: But the Rea&s;on we were taken for Pyrates was, that making to Shore to &s;ave our &s;elves, we &s;aw a Bark riding at Anchor, without the Port of <HI>Campeche,</HI> which we made to, in order to enquire wherea|bouts we were, and to beg &s;ome Provi&s;i|ons, our own being gone, and entring the Ve&s;&s;el, found but two People in't; the third, jumping into the Water, &s;wam on Shore, and brought three Boats fill'd with <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldiers, which enter'd the Ve&s;&s;el before we could make off. Make off! &s;aid I, what did you de&s;ign to run away with the Ve&s;&s;el? No; an&s;wer'd <HI>Warren,</HI> with &s;ome Confu&s;ion, but we did de&s;ign to weigh Anchor, and go far|ther in Shore, that we might land in the Morning, it being late at Night; but we were prevented by their coming on
<PB N="63" REF="141">
Board us, where we were found, being arm'd, which we had taken Care of, when we went into our Boat, to defend our|&s;elves, if we were obliged to land among the <HI>Savages:</HI> And indeed they had their Arms re&s;tor'd 'em, when they were freed and &s;ent on Board with me.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I did not like the Fel|low's being nonplus'd now and then, in not knowing what to &s;ay; but upon Con&s;ideration, thought it might be for Want of Words to expre&s;s him&s;elf better, which is the Occa&s;ion very often of Peo|ple of common Under&s;tanding Stammer|ing, and Humming, and Hawing, to put their Words in better Order; &s;o for that Time I took no more Notice, not weigh|ing it in my Mind. But in the Evening Mr. <HI>Middleton</HI> came to me, with a Face of Concern, and told me he did not like the&s;e Fellows Tale. Why &s;o? &s;ays I. Becau&s;e I ob&s;erve they herd together, an&s;wer'd he, and are always whi&s;pering and &s;peaking low to one another. Oh! &s;ays I, there cannot be any Danger in 'em; for if they had any Inclination to run away with our Ve&s;&s;el, they might
<PB N="64" REF="142">
have done it when they were five to one, before we took you in. I know not, re|ply'd <HI>Middleton,</HI> I have a Heart forebodes &s;omething. P&s;haw, old Womens Fears; (&s;aid I) for, as I &s;aid before, they wou'd have don't when they had more Power; before I landed on <HI>De&s;pair I&s;land,</HI> (as I call'd it) if they had any &s;uch Intentions. There is a Providence that rules o'er all our Actions, (an&s;wer'd <HI>Middleton)</HI> that we can no more &s;ee into, than the Book of Fate; but if a foreboding Heart may &s;peak, I am &s;ure &s;omething we &s;hall &s;uf|fer from the&s;e Fellows, that will be of Danger to us. If &s;o, reply'd I, there's no re&s;i&s;ting the Will of Providence; for what will come, will come, and there's no Fending again&s;t it: But, added he, this &s;eems &s;omething like Fore&punc;know|ledge; and to re&s;i&s;t again&s;t that, &s;eems like &s;truggling again&s;t the Will of Heav'n; that warns us by the&s;e Forebodings to prevent the&s;e Accidents of Life. I be|lieve God, pur&s;u'd he, has fix'd a Period to our Breath; but Accidents that hap|pen in this Pilgrimage of Life, may be avoided by a timely Notice: As we are
<PB N="65" REF="143">
all Partakers of free Will, and from that, form our own Happine&s;s, or Mi&s;ery, it cannot be &s;aid but that the Actions of Life may be regulated by that free Will. Our Maker never form'd a Villain! nei|ther does their external Parts differ from a virtuous Man's; if they did, they were to be ea&s;ily avoided: But as an old Poet &s;ays, <HI>There's no Art to find the Mind's Con&s;truction in the Face.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Di&s;cour&s;e, I began to &s;tag|ger in my Opinion of their Hone&s;ty, and therefore we re&s;olv'd to &s;tand upon our Guard. We took no Notice of our Con|ference then to our two other Compani|ons, but re&s;olv'd to &s;tay till Night, we having a better Opportunity, being we lay together in the Cabbin Aft; (which is as much as to &s;ay, in the Stern, or be|hind) when we were to go to Supper, we call'd one another to come, but five of the Sailors excus'd them&s;elves, by &s;aying they had Din'd &s;o lately, that they had no Stomach as yet; whereup|on we had an Opportunity &s;ooner to conver&s;e together than we de&s;ign'd. For being at Supper, we open'd the Matter
<PB N="66" REF="144">
to our other two Companions, and they agreed immediately that we were in &s;ome Danger; &s;o we re&s;olv'd in the middle Watch of the Night, to &s;eize 'em in their Sleep. We were to have the fir&s;t Watch, which we &s;et at Eight of the Clock; then they were to Watch till Twelve; and then in their third Watch, between One and Two, we had conclu|ded to &s;eize upon 'em as they &s;lept; that is, Four of 'em, for One of them watch'd with us, which was <HI>Franck Hood,</HI> the Cook; whom we agreed to &s;eize and bind fa&s;t, towards the latter End of the Watch, and to threaten him with Death if he offer'd to make the lea&s;t Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as ever our fir&s;t Watch was &s;et, we &s;ent Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> to prepare our Arms; in about a Half an Hour, or thereabouts <HI>Warren,</HI> call'd to <HI>Hood</HI> upon Deck, (they lying below) to get him a little Water, for he was bloody dry, he &s;aid: Whereupon the other went down immediately with &s;ome Water in a Can to him. As &s;oon as he was gone down, I had the Curio&s;ity to draw as near the Scuttle as I could to hear the Di&s;cour&s;e.
<PB N="67" REF="145">
Now, you mu&s;t know, <HI>Hood,</HI> our Cook, had been employ'd that Day about &s;earch|ing our Provi&s;ions, our Beef Casks, and Pork, to &s;ee what Quantity we had, that we might know how long it would la&s;t; &s;o that the others had not an Opportu|nity to di&s;clo&s;e the De&s;ign to him. As &s;oon as he was got down, I cou'd hear <HI>Will Warren</HI> &s;ay to him G&mdash;d D&mdash;n ye, <HI>Franck,</HI> we had like to have been &s;moak'd to Day; and tho' we had con|triv'd the Story that I told 'em, yet I was a little &s;urpriz'd at their asking me, becau&s;e then I did not expect it; but we de&s;ign to be even with 'em in a very lit|tle Time: For, hark ye, &s;ays he, and &s;pake &s;o low that I cou'd not hear him; upon which, the other &s;aid there's no Difficulty in the Matter; but we need not be in &s;uch Ha&s;te, for you know, as we ply it to Windward, a Day or two can break no Squares, and we can &s;oon (after the Effecting our De&s;ign) bear down to Leeward to our Comrades that we left on Shore; for I fancy, added he, that they have &s;ome &s;mall Su&s;picion of you now, (which in Time will &s;leep)
<PB N="68" REF="146">
and may be on their Guard; therefore 'tis better to wait a Day or two: No, G&mdash;d Z&mdash;ds, we'll do it too Night, when they are a&s;leep, reply'd <HI>Warren;</HI> whereupon there were many Arguments, <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con;</HI> (as I fancy'd) but they &s;poke &s;o low, that I cou'd only hear a G&mdash;d D&mdash;n ye, now and then, and &s;omething of that Kind.</P>
<P>A little while after, <HI>Hood</HI> came up a|gain, and after walking up and down, and fixing his Eyes often upon me, who in the mean Time was provided with a Couple of Pi&s;tols under my Watch-Coat, and indeed were their own, that we hung up ready charg'd in our Cabbin; which was one Rea&s;on of their De&s;ign to &s;eize on us in our Sleep, being they had no Arms till they cou'd &s;eize on 'em where they hung; or el&s;e, they were &s;uch de&s;|perate Fellows, they wou'd have don't in the open Day. <HI>Hood,</HI> as I &s;aid before, &s;eem'd to fix his Eyes frequently upon me, for till now I never watch'd in the Night; at la&s;t, &s;aid he very &s;oftly, if you plea&s;e, Mr. <HI>Falconer,</HI> I have a Word or two to &s;ay to you, that much con|cerns
<PB N="69" REF="147">
you All. What is it? &s;ays I. Why, an&s;wer'd He, I wou'd have the re&s;t of your Companions, Ear Witne&s;&s;es too; with that I call'd 'em together; but, &s;ays he, let's retire as far from the Scuttle as we can, that we may not be heard by a|ny below Deck; &s;o we went into the Cabbin, and open'd the Scuttle above, that Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave,</HI> who &s;teer'd, might hear what was &s;aid. When we were &s;at down upon the Floor, Mr. <HI>Hood</HI> began as follows. My four Companions below have a wicked De&s;ign upon you; that is, to &s;eize you, and put you into the Boat, and run away with your Ve&s;&s;el: But I thinking it an inhuman Action, not only to any one, but to you in particu|lar, that have been the Means of their Freedom; therefore, I hope, appointed by Providence, I come to let you know it, that we may think of &s;ome Means to prevent it. Upon this, (finding his Sin|cerity,) I told him that we were provi|ded again&s;t it already; and with the Con|&s;ent of my Companions, told him our De&s;ign of &s;eizing 'em in the third Watch; but, &s;ays he, they intend to put their
<PB N="70" REF="148">
Project in Practice, their next Watch; therefore I think 'twill be more proper for us to Counter-plot 'em, and &s;eize 'em this; but as they have no Arms, &s;ays I, and we have, we need not fear 'em.</P>
<P>We had &s;everal Debates about this, which took up too much Time to our Sorrow. For <HI>Warren</HI> mi&s;tru&s;ting <HI>Hood,</HI> it &s;eems, got up and li&s;ten'd, and when he found that we retir'd all of us to the Cabbin, he got upon Deck, and &s;teal|ing &s;oftly, came &s;o clo&s;e, that he over|heard every thing we &s;aid, which as &s;oon as he under&s;tood, he went immediately to his Companions, who waited impatient|ly, (as they told us afterwards) and let 'em know all our Di&s;cour&s;e; whereupon, without pau&s;ing, they re&s;olv'd to &s;eize us immediately, in the Mid&s;t of our Con|&s;ultation; which was no &s;ooner re&s;olv'd upon, but done: For we were immediately &s;urpriz'd with their &s;eizing us, which they did with that Quickne&s;s, and &s;o unper|ceivably, that we were all confounded and amaz'd; they had whip'd off two Pi&s;tols in our Con&s;ternation, which they clap'd to our Brea&s;ts. In this Confu|&s;ion,
<PB N="71" REF="149">
I had forgot mine that were at my Girdle, (or el&s;e we might have been hard enough for 'em;) neither did I re|member 'em till they found 'em about me. They had &s;hut the Cabbin Door on the In&s;ide, till they had bound us, and ne|ver minded Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> knocking and making a Noi&s;e, till they had &s;ecur'd us. Which done, they open'd the Door, and &s;eiz'd him, who came to know what the Matter was, for we had no Candle in the Cabbin, and he hearing a Noi&s;e among&s;t us, thought we were &s;eizing <HI>Hood,</HI> and call'd to us to forbear, (as he &s;aid af|terwards) and make Ha&s;te, for he was going to tack about, tho' we did not hear him; on which he clap'd the Helm a Lee, and came down to fetch us out, to haul off the Sheets, &amp;c. and was &s;eiz'd, and bound with us; for they left us immediately, being the Sails flutter'd in the Wind, by Rea&s;on &s;he was veering round, when the Helm was a Lee.</P>
<P>After they had fix'd the Ve&s;&s;el, and it was broad Day, they came and unbound our Legs, and gave us Leave to walk upon Deck; whereupon I began to ex|po&s;tulate
<PB N="72" REF="150">
with 'em, particularly Mr. <HI>War|ren,</HI> being he &s;eem'd to have a &s;ort of Command over the others. Pray, &s;ays I to him, for what Rea&s;on have you &s;eiz'd upon us, and bound us in this Man|ner? Have we done you any Injury? Why, &s;ays he, Self-pre&s;ervation; I found you were a going to do the like by us, therefore you are but &s;erv'd in your Kind. And what do you de&s;ign to do with us, now you have your De&s;ire? Do with you! why, by and by we de&s;ign to put you in the Boat, and turn you a-drift; but for that Son of a B&mdash;h, <HI>Hood,</HI> we'll murder him without Mercy; a Dog, to betray us! How, betray you! reply'd I? Yes! for I overheard All; then related the Manner of it as mention'd above. But as you have not &s;o much injur'd us, we'll put you immediately in the Boat, with a Week's Provi&s;ions, and a &s;mall Sail, and you &s;hall &s;eek your Fortune, as I &s;uppo&s;e you wou'd have done by us. No, an&s;wer'd I, we only de&s;ign'd to con|fine you till we came to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and there to have given you your Liberty to go where you had thought fit. Ay, ay,
<PB N="73" REF="151">
&s;ays <HI>Warren,</HI> &s;haking his Head, this is ea&s;ily &s;aid, nor are we bound to believe you. Why, 'tis plain, &s;aid I, that our con&s;ulting to &s;eize you, was but to pre|vent what has happen'd. We are not to enquire into the Matter, an&s;wer'd <HI>War|ren,</HI> and now we have you in our Pow|er, we'll do as we think fit. Why then&punc; &s;ays I, put us a&s;hore at any Land that belongs to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and we &s;hall think you have not done us any Injury. No, &s;ays he, we mu&s;t go to meet our Captain and Fifty Men upon the Main Land of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> where our Ve&s;&s;el was &s;tranded not to be gotten off. Our fir&s;t De&s;ign when we were taken in our Boat, was to get us a Ve&s;&s;el to go a <HI>Buccaneer|ing,</HI> which we had done at <HI>Campeche,</HI> if it had not been for the <HI>Indian</HI> that &s;wam a Shore unknown to us, and brought Succours too &s;oon; which we cou'd not avoid, the Sea Breeze blowing very &s;trong all Night; &s;o we &s;eeing our Dan|ger, were forc'd to form the Lie we told the Governour, which had &s;ome Appear|ance of Truth, for we did not u&s;e any Vi|olence to the two old <HI>Spaniards,</HI> being by

<P>When they had got every Thing ready, that is to &s;ay, a Barrel of Bisket, ano|ther of Water, about half a Dozen Pie|ces of Beef, and as much Pork, a &s;mall Kettle, and a Tinder-Box; we were bet|ter provided than we expected, by much.

When this was done, he order'd 'em to tie <HI>Hood</HI> to the Ma&s;t of the Ve&s;&s;el, and was charging a Pi&s;tol to &s;hoot him thro&punc; the Head, not con&s;idering it was charg'd before, for it was one of them I had at my Girdle, and which they took from me; but in his Eagerne&s;s and Heat of Pa&s;&s;ion did not mind it.

<PB N="78" REF="156">
rely upon the Saviour of the World, that dy'd for our Sins, to pardon mine. With that, he cro&s;s'd him&s;elf, and expir'd.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was very &s;orry for the unhappy Accident of his Death; but yet, glad that we were at Liberty; and was &s;omething ea&s;y that the poor Soul repented before his Expiration; not doubting but the piercing Eye of Provi|dence, &s;aw that if he had &s;urviv'd, he would have liv'd a good Chri&s;tian. And &s;ure the Almighty's infinite Stock of Bounty, has enough Mercy to &s;ave the repenting Soul, tho' late before his Re|pentance comes.</P>
<P>After we had &s;ecur'd our <HI>Tartars,</HI> we threw Mr. <HI>Warren</HI> Over-board, and bore up to the Wind; for after our fir&s;t tack|ing about in the Morning, when the Bu|&s;tle happen'd, they bore away with Tack at Cat-head, as being for their Purpo&s;e. The three Men that were left, de&s;ir'd us to let 'em have the Boat, and go &s;eek their Companions; which we refus'd, as not having Hands enough to carry our Ve&s;&s;el to <HI>Jamaica.</HI> But we promis'd 'em, if they wou'd freely work in the Voyage,
<PB N="79" REF="157">
they &s;hou'd have their intire Liberty to go where they thought fit, without any Complaints again&s;t them. Upon this, we began to be a little &s;ociable as before, and they all declar'd, that what they did was by the In&s;tigation of <HI>Warren.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day we di&s;cover'd a Ship to Windward of us, that bore down upon us with crowded Sails. We fill'd all the Sails we had, and endeavour'd to get a|way from her as fa&s;t as we cou'd, but all to no Purpo&s;e; we &s;aw they gain'd upon us every Moment, and therefore &s;eeing it was not po&s;&s;ible for us to e&s;cape, we back'd our Sails and laid by for 'em, that they might be more civil if they were Enemies. As &s;oon as ever they came up with us, they hail'd us, and order'd us to come on Board, which we dur&s;t not deny; when Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> and I, with <HI>Hood</HI> and <HI>White</HI> for Rowers, went on Board 'em. We found by <HI>Hood</HI>'s knowing 'em, that they were his Cap|tain and Comrades. Now, as <HI>Hood</HI> &s;aid, we did not know how we &s;hou'd behave our &s;elves, or what we &s;hou'd &s;ay about <HI>Warren;</HI> but we only told the Captain
<PB N="80" REF="158">
how we met with his Men, and that they were redeem'd upon my Account. He never ask'd particularly for <HI>Warren,</HI> but how they All did; but when they &s;ent on Board to &s;earch our Ve&s;&s;el, they &s;oon came to the Truth on't; for the o|ther three told 'em the Story, tho' not with aggravating Circum&s;tances: Upon which, poor <HI>Hood</HI> was ty'd to their Main|ma&s;t, la&s;h'd with a Cat of Nine-Tails mo&s;t abominably; and after that pic|kled in Brine, which was more Pain than the Whipping; but it kept his Back from fe&s;tering, which it might otherwi&s;e have done; becau&s;e they flea the Skin off at every Stroke, and to prevent it, they wa&s;h it with Brine; which is call'd <HI>Whipping</HI> and <HI>Pickeling.</HI> After this they wou'd not keep him among 'em; but &s;ent for the other three Men from our Ve&s;&s;el, and order'd us all on Board, with another of their Men that was ill of a dangerous Fever, which they fear'd might prove in|fectious. They did not take any Thing from us, as we expected at fir&s;t, only gave us this &s;ick Man to look after, which we were very well contented with.
<PB N="81" REF="159">
So we parted with 'em very well &s;atisfy'd, but much better when we were out of Sight, fearing they had forgot them|&s;elves, and wou'd &s;end for us back, and take our Provi&s;ion from us, or one Mi&s;|chief or another; for Pyrates do not often u&s;e to be &s;o courteous.</P>
<P>Our &s;ick Man mended apace, for we took great Care of him, and by keeping him low, only with Water-Gruel, his Fever left him; when I began to keep up his Spirits with my Cordials that I had by me, and in a Week's Time he was pretty hoddy, (as we call it at Sea). Now we began to conver&s;e with him, and he &s;eem'd to be a &s;en&s;ible good|humour'd Fellow.</P>
<P>Among other Di&s;cour&s;e, we ask'd him how Captain <HI>M&mdash;ll</HI> and his Crew got a Ship? Says he, I can only tell the Story as I heard it; (for I was &s;ick on Shore) which is as follows:</P>
<P>Sixteen of our Men got a <HI>Paragua</HI> from the <HI>Indians,</HI> who hate the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> tho' under their Subjection, and love the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> very well; the&s;e &s;et out to &s;eize upon the fir&s;t Ship
<PB N="82" REF="160">
that they thought they cou'd compa&s;s; when after being five Days Crui&s;ing a|long Shore, they &s;py'd a large Ship wea|thering <HI>Cape Catoch;</HI> but believing it to be too &s;trong for 'em, they re&s;olv'd to work by Stratagem, thus: Twelve Men laid down in the Boat, as if very faint and weak, and made a Signal to the Ship, as if in Di&s;tre&s;s, who very charitably brought too; now they had no Arms with 'em, for when they re&s;olv'd to u&s;e this Stratagem, they left 'em a-Shore, as making the Pretence more fea&s;ible; &s;o that when they arriv'd at the Ship, they all went feebly up, as if not able to &s;tand; nay, &s;ome were oblig'd to be led, for&s;ooth, to colour the Matter the bet|ter. They then told 'em that their Ship was ca&s;t away upon <HI>Logerhead</HI>'s <HI>Key,</HI> a|bout three Leagues from <HI>Cape Catoch,</HI> and &s;aving them&s;elves in their Boats, they got &s;afe into the <HI>Cape;</HI> but that wan|dering up in the Country, they were met by the <HI>Indians,</HI> who us'd 'em bar|barou&s;ly, killing Eleven of their Num|ber; and wou'd have &s;erv'd the re&s;t &s;o, if they had not made their E&s;|cape

in that <HI>Paragua;</HI> that they were &s;o harra&s;s'd for want of Food, having been without eating two Days, that they fear'd &s;ome of their Companions wou'd never recover.</P>
<P>The poor <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;wallow'd the Bait, and their Captain being a very good Man, re&s;olv'd to relieve 'em, and ask'd 'em what they wou'd have him to do for 'em? They beg'd him to land 'em on the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colony, or I&s;land in their Way. He an&s;wer'd, he was bound for St. <HI>Domingo</HI> in <HI>Hi&s;paniola;</HI> but that he wou'd put in at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> tho' &s;omething out of his Way; yet, &s;ays he, I don't care for going to any of the noted Ports, becau&s;e there is a War talk'd of between <HI>Eng|land</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and tho' it was not pro|claim'd they might meet with &s;ome Trou|ble. They were mightily oblig'd to him, they &s;aid, but they did not know how to return the Obligation, but by praying for him and his.</P>
<P>They &s;ail'd very lovingly with 'em for three or four Days, till at la&s;t For|tune gave them an Opportunity to put their Enterprize in Execution. They
<PB N="84" REF="162">
had Notice that the Ship leak'd migh|tily, and that the Water came into the Bread-Room; upon which, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> went down to remove the Bread to get at the Leak, and did not leave more than five Men and the Captain above, whom they in&s;tantly &s;eiz'd, and clap'd down the Hatches upon the re&s;t. When they had &s;e|cur'd them, they arm'd them&s;elves with Pi&s;tols and Launces, which were plac'd in the Steerage of the Ship, and &s;o ca|pitulated with 'em; but fir&s;t, they &s;teer'd their Cour&s;e back again, that they might not lo&s;e any Time. As they came up, one by one, they bound them, till they were all &s;o, but the Captain and the Pi|lot: The Captain they confin'd to his Cabbin, with a Centry to guard him; but they let the Pilot go loo&s;e, that he might &s;teer the Ship. O inhuman! cry'd I! thus the Snake in the friendly Bo&s;om warm'd, turns and &s;tings his kind Pro|tector: Thus was their generous <HI>Ho&s;t</HI> (if I may call him &s;o) betray'd by his too much good Nature.</P>
<P>After they had brought the Ship &s;afe to us, we embark'd, and put the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="163">
on Shore without a Mor&s;el to help them&s;elves; nay, if the <HI>Indians</HI> cou'd conveniently meet with 'em, they wou'd not leave one alive. I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, pur&s;u'd the Man, that the barbarous Story &s;hock'd my very Nature, and made me hate their Society; and I re|ally believe the Abhorrence of this curs'd Action brought my Di&s;temper upon me.</P>
<P>How much are &s;ome Bea&s;ts Acknow|ledgments of Kindne&s;s more than Man? A poor Cur, fed but with a Cru&s;t a Day, will follow &s;till the bounteous Hand that gives it. Ingratitude is the Fountain of all other Crimes, for from thence flow all the re&s;t. But all the Knowledge &s;ome Men are endow'd with, is but to find the be&s;t Way to deceive. How happy it would be, if &s;uch Creatures cou'd &s;hake off their Humanity, and become Bea&s;ts in Form as well as Mind; then we &s;hou'd have a Mark to &s;hun 'em by. Our Creator has form'd all Kind of Bea&s;ts in Shapes that tell us what they are: But Men differ in their Natures more than Bea&s;ts, or are indeed under their Hu|man Form, the very Natures of the Brute

Creation. How many Villains, under a &s;mooth Face and Tongue, betray their Bro|thers? The Father cheats the Son, the Son the Father, Mothers &s;quander the Dowry of their Daughters, and then pro&s;titute 'em to gain 'em Bread; which is not Gain but Puni&s;hment: But Ingratitude, like Murder, meets with its Puni&s;hment on Earth, as well as in the other World; and an ungrateful Man &s;hou'd have a Mark that all Human Society may &s;hun him. I think the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> us'd to puni&s;h Ingratitude with Death, as a Crime equal to Sacriledge or Parricide.</P>
<P>After having taken all their Men on Board, (and leaving Directions on a Bark of a Tree, for the five Men that were gone upon the &s;ame De&s;ign ano|ther Way;) we &s;et &s;ail, and had not been out two Days before we met with you. Pray, &s;ays I, how came you among 'em, if you lik'd not their De&s;ign? Why, Sir, an&s;wer'd he by Accident; Em|barking from <HI>Bermudas,</HI> bound for St. <HI>Catherines,</HI> or the I&s;le of <HI>Providence,</HI> we were met by this Pyrate in a Ship of
<PB N="87" REF="165">
twenty Guns, and a hundred and twenty Men, who took us, and rumaging us, threaten'd to turn us a-drift without Pro|vi&s;ion, if we wou'd not embrace his De|&s;igns, which was Pyracy. We, rather than undergo what he threaten'd us with|al, con&s;ented with our Tongues; but our Inclinations were far from it. And from our fir&s;t being with him, we were plot|ing to make our E&s;cape the next Oppor|tunity. But the other four (being but five in all in our Ve&s;&s;el) were unfortunate|ly kill'd in that Engagement, where they lo&s;t their Ship. What Ship was it they fought with? Why, Sir, a Man of War of twenty &s;ix Guns, &s;ent out on Purpo&s;e to take her; for the Captain had com|mitted &s;uch Di&s;orders where-ever he came, that he oblig'd the Governour of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to &s;end out the Ship call'd the <HI>Experiment,</HI> to crui&s;e till &s;he met with him; which &s;he did about five Weeks a|go. Our Captain, as &s;oon as he &s;aw her, gue&s;s'd at her De&s;ign, and re&s;olv'd to fight her to the la&s;t; well knowing if he could take or &s;ink her, he might be pretty &s;ecure to range where he pleas'd,
<PB N="88" REF="166">
there being never another Ship of War nearer than <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> who never came &s;o far We&s;t. After he had made a Speech to his Men to encourage them to fight it out, and told 'em their Advantage, they con&s;ented to hoi&s;t the Bloody Flag, and neither to give or take Quarter. As &s;oon as ever the Man of War &s;aw our Bloody Flag out, they hoi&s;ted theirs, and there en&s;u'd a dreadful Fight. We began about two a-Clock, and fought till dark Night, without perceiving any Advantage on either Side; and then by Con&s;ent lay by till Morning without fighting; which we did &s;o nigh, it being calm, that we cou'd talk to one another; but we did it only in threatning Lan|guage. As &s;oon as the Morning dawn'd, we went to it agen, with more Fury than before, for our People fought like de&s;pe|rate Madmen, well knowing if they &s;hou'd be taken, they mu&s;t all die. The other Ship fought with a Bravery un|common; but I believe the Advantage was on our Side, tho' we had kill'd on Board us thirty &s;ix Men.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="167">
We fought on till Noon, when we di&s;|cover'd a Ship about three Leagues to Windward of us, which bore down upon us with all the Sail they cou'd. We &s;oon conjectur'd, they cou'd be no Friends to us, &s;o without much Con&s;ultation, we re&s;olv'd to run it before the Wind, with all the Sail we cou'd make; as for the <HI>Experiment</HI> we fought with, we had put it out of their Power to follow us, being we had &s;hot their Main-Ma&s;t by the Board, &s;o that if the other overtook us we &s;hou'd have but one to deal with. We by good Fortune had all our Ma&s;ts firm, and we out-&s;ail'd the other Ve&s;&s;el; but as &s;oon as &s;he came up with the <HI>Ex|periment,</HI> (who never offer'd to follow us) &s;he laid by, as we &s;uppo&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, and we ob&s;erv'd thro' our Tele&s;copes that &s;he had <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colours out.</P>
<P>We &s;oon lo&s;t Sight of 'em, and then we de&s;ign'd to change our Cour&s;e, but were prevented by the Men di&s;covering two Foot Water in the Hold; who cou'd not find out the Leak, tho' they &s;earch'd with all the Dilligence they cou'd. So we were oblig'd to Pump, but all that
<PB N="90" REF="168">
we cou'd do, the Water &s;till gain'd up|on us, we re&s;olv'd to bear away to <HI>Jucatan,</HI> a Province belonging to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and &s;eek out &s;ome conve|nient Place unfrequented by them, where we might find out our Leak, and &s;top it.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding our Labour in Pump|ing, the Water gain'd upon us; &s;o we put out our Long-Boat, and our Pinnace, in order to put in our Provi&s;ion; which by Morning we effected, and very hap|pily for us; for it was agreed upon all Hands, the Ship cou'd not &s;wim above Eight Hours; and tho' we di&s;cover'd Land, and were not above &s;ix Leagues off Shore, yet we were afraid we cou'd not reach it, being the Ship was &s;o hea|vy with Water. So all that cou'd not &s;wim were order'd into the two Boats, with their Arms; which held in 'em thir|ty &s;even Men with Officers. They that were left on Board, had Orders to Pump as long as they cou'd, and run direct|ly into Shore to the Leeward of <HI>Cape Catoch;</HI> but within half a League off the Place the Ship &s;unk, and the Men be|took
<PB N="91" REF="169">
them&s;elves to &s;wiming, which we met with our Pinnace, and took up.</P>
<P>I cannot omit one barbarous Action of the Captain's. There was five Men wounded, who beg'd to be taken into the Boat, but the Captain refus'd 'em; and this was his Rea&s;on, as he gave to us in the Boat. Says he, tho&s;e five that are wounded, will take up too much Room, being they can't &s;it as we do, but mu&s;t lie along; and another Thing is, they will take more Time in looking after, than we can well &s;pare. Be&s;ides, as I believe they won't recover, they will be the &s;ooner out of their Pain; and if they &s;hou'd recover, added he, they wou'd help us to devour our Provi&s;ion, which we mu&s;t take particular Care of, for we know not when we &s;hall get more. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, this U&s;age &s;truck me to the Heart almo&s;t, e&s;pecially as to one of 'em, who &s;eem'd to have a Sen&s;e of his Condition, and repented of all his pa&s;t Crimes.</P>
<P>After we were on Shore, we found that we had kill'd on Board us forty three Men, be|&s;ides the five that our Captain barbarou&s;|ly
<PB N="92" REF="170">
murder'd, by leaving 'em in the Ship when &s;he &s;unk. Two of their Bodies were drove on Shore the next Day, but were order'd by the Captain to have Stones ty'd to their Feet, and carry'd off Shore and &s;unk. As &s;oon as we had made us two Tents with Sails that were put in the Boat for that Purpo&s;e, they be|gan to con&s;ult in what Manner they &s;hou'd get a Ship; when one <HI>Warren</HI> pro|pos'd to take the Boat, and four Men be&s;ide him&s;elf, with Arms, and a Week's Provi&s;ion, for he wou'd not have any more, and go to the Bay of <HI>Campeache,</HI> or <HI>Campeche</HI> Town, where he did not fear getting a Ve&s;&s;el for their Purpo&s;e; being he &s;aid he had done &s;o upon the like Occa&s;ion before. Whereupon the Boat and four Men were order'd for him; but he &s;taying longer than the appoint|ed Time, they thought &s;ome Mi&s;chance had happen'd to him, &s;o took off their Thoughts of having any Ve&s;&s;el from him. One Day they &s;py'd a large <HI>Pa|ragua</HI> coming towards Shore with Nine <HI>Indians,</HI> and two <HI>Spaniards</HI> in't, and finding it come &s;o near, that they
<PB N="93" REF="171">
mu&s;t of Cour&s;e &s;ee 'em, they immediately re&s;olv'd either to take or kill 'em all, for fear they &s;hou'd di&s;cover 'em to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> before they had got a Ve&s;&s;el to go off again.</P>
<P>Tho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s there was &s;ome Rea&s;on, yet I thought it barbarous to &s;ee how they murder'd the two <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and nine <HI>Indians.</HI> They put out their Pinnace and ten Men well arm'd, to go and take this <HI>Paragua;</HI> as &s;oon as ever they were di&s;cover'd by the <HI>Indians,</HI> they jump'd Over-board, and made towards Shore; but were &s;hot by our Men, or knock'd on the Head with the Butt-End of their Mu&s;quets. The two <HI>Spaniards</HI> had a new Kind of Death; they ty'd 'em, Brea&s;t to Brea&s;t, and their Hands behind 'em, and threw 'em Over-board; where they &s;truggl'd for &s;ome Time, and at la&s;t were drown'd. I thought this was a Cruelty exceeding all the Tyrants in the World, and if I had had a Boat, and our People never a one, I wou'd have run any Hazard to have &s;av'd 'em. Their <HI>Paragua</HI> was laden with Flower, and dry'd Fi&s;h, with &s;everal Sides of dry'd
<PB N="94" REF="172">
Pork, or Bacon; which was too good for the People that had it. As for my own Part, but little of it came to my Share, for I was taken ill the &s;econd Day after we came there, and &s;o weak and feeble, that I did not expect to overcome it; and if it had not been for a Black, that was Trumpeter to the Captain, I &s;hou'd have peri&s;h'd for want of Su&s;tenance; but the poor Fellow frequently wou'd bring me &s;omething or other to nouri&s;h me; and it is to him, under God, that I owe my Life. He wou'd often tell me that he did not love that &s;ort of Life, and wi&s;h'd he cou'd get rid of his Ma&s;ter; but, &s;ays he, if he did but know I had as much as a Thought that Way, he wou'd be the Death of me. I believe this was the only poor Fellow that pray'd in the whole Crew. He was chri&s;ten'd at <HI>Ply|mouth</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> (and had very good Notions of Religion) where he was giv|en to his pre&s;ent Ma&s;ter, who had made &s;everal Voyages into the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> for a <HI>Plymouth</HI> Merchant; but at la&s;t find|ing Matters on Shore go but indifferent|ly, and having kill'd a <HI>French</HI> Officer

<P>Says I, this Fellow's too wicked to have Succe&s;s in any Thing, e&s;pecially when Succe&s;s mu&s;t be an Addition to his Crimes: If it were po&s;&s;ible to know his Fate, we &s;hou'd find that he wou'd have &s;ome de&s;perate End: For Men when a|bandon'd by Providence Divine, tho' perhaps they may meet with &s;ome Succe&s;s at fir&s;t, at la&s;t find an End that's fitted for &s;uch Wretches, who de|ny a Superior Being; and even Athe|i&s;ts, notwith&s;tanding their Human Form, are no better than Brutes; nay, I take an <HI>Athei&s;t</HI> or <HI>Dei&s;t,</HI> to have far le&s;s Right to Salvation, than tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> that pray to the Devil; for they do it thro' Ignorance, and Wor&s;hip him with a more &s;incere Devotion, becau&s;e they know 'tis in his Power to do 'em Harm.

&s;erve the true God, if they knew (as all who profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity do) that it is in his Power to be&s;tow Ble&s;&s;ings, even after this Life. With what Devotion they Wor&s;hip the Sun, who they take to be the Superior Deity, becau&s;e it makes the Earth green, and is the &s;econd Cau&s;e of all the Good they enjoy?

<P><HI>Bermudas,</HI> (the Place of my Birth) or the <HI>Summer I&s;lands,</HI> is &s;uppos'd by &s;ome, to take its Name of <HI>Bermudas</HI> from cer|tain Black Hogs that came out of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship that was ca&s;t away on tho&s;e Shores. And by others from one <HI>John Bermudas,</HI> a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> the fir&s;t Di&s;cover|er of the I&s;lands. The Name <HI>Summer I&s;lands,</HI> is deriv'd from <HI>George Summers,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, who &s;uffer'd Shipwreck there. They are &s;ituated in thirty two Degrees, and twenty five Minutes of Northern Latitude; Sixteen Hundred Leagues from <HI>England;</HI> Twelve Hun|dred from <HI>Madera;</HI> Four Hundred from <HI>Hi&s;paniola;</HI> and about Three Hundred from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New England.</HI> The <HI>Spa|niards</HI> had it fir&s;t, and after them the <HI>French;</HI> but the Supplies that were &s;ent 'em from <HI>France</HI> mi&s;carrying by Ship|wreck, they were oblig'd to abandon the I&s;lands.

The Form of the I&s;lands as they lie, re|&s;embles &s;omething of a Lob&s;ter with its Claws off. The Chief of the I|&s;lands is call'd <HI>George I&s;land,</HI> and is di|vided into Eight Parts, be&s;ides the Ge|neral Land. 1. <HI>Hamilton Tribe;</HI> 2. <HI>Smith</HI>'s <HI>Tribe;</HI> 3. <HI>Devon&s;hire Tribe;</HI> 4. <HI>Pembroke Tribe;</HI> 5. <HI>Paget</HI>'s <HI>Tribe;</HI> 6. <HI>Warwick Tribe;</HI> 7. <HI>Southampton Tribe;</HI> 8. <HI>Sandy</HI>'s <HI>Tribe.</HI> The I&s;lands are all &s;urrounded by Rocks, that at High-Water are dan|gerous to Strangers.

The Leaves are downy, and prickly at the End: The Berries that it produceth are of a pale Red which inclo&s;e four White Kernels; the Outermo&s;t Skin is &s;weet; the Innermo&s;t that contains the Kernel, is &s;harp; and the Pulp is tarti&s;h. The Tree is always flouri&s;hing, being at the &s;ame Time full of Blo&s;&s;oms, green, and ripe Fruit. The Berries when ripe begin to gape, and fall off in Rainy Weather; leaving a round Stalk on the Boughs, which lo&s;es not its Rind till that Time two Years after. The Berry requires one Year before it comes to its full Ripe|ne&s;s, which happens about <HI>December.</HI> The Boughs &s;hoot upwards, and in a little Time are &s;o heavy, that they weigh down the Body of the Tree. There are many Plants, as the Prickle Pear, Poy&s;on Weed, Red Weed, Purging Bean, Red Pepper, and the Co&s;tive Tree, and the Sea Feather, which grows on the Brink of the Sea. There is another Plant call'd <HI>Nuchtly,</HI> which grows in

<P>About a Month before I embark'd for this unfortunate Voyage, we took a <HI>French</HI> Pyrate, who was &s;o in&s;olent as to come into <HI>Harrinton</HI>'s <HI>Sound,</HI> even at Noon-Day, and cut the Cables of a Merchant-man, richly laden, bound for <HI>England;</HI> but by good Fortune run up|on the Flats in the Mouth of the <HI>Sound,</HI> in going out again: So we had Time to Man &s;ome Boats with &s;ome of the Soldi|ers of the Garri&s;on, and &s;end to their Relief, where there happen'd a de&s;perate Fight for &s;ome Time; but more Forces going to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the others, they took 'em after an ob&s;tinate Re&s;i&s;t|ance, killing twenty &s;even of their Men, and lo&s;ing eleven of our own. The Captain made his E&s;cape in his Boat,
<PB N="107" REF="185">
in the latter End of the Engagement, when he perceiv'd his Danger; but was o|blig'd to go on Shore on <HI>Ireland I&s;land</HI> for &s;ome Provi&s;ion, where he, and four Men that were with him, were &s;ecur'd, and &s;ent to <HI>Tucker</HI>'s <HI>Town;</HI> where they were to be try'd the Day I came a|way.</P>
<P>Two Nights after we had parted with the Pyrate, we were encounter'd with a dreadful Storm, that la&s;ted two Days without abating; and out poor Bark, which was none of the be&s;t, was tumbl'd and to&s;s'd like a Tennis-Ball, yet we receiv'd no Damage, but that &s;he wou'd not an&s;wer the Helm; &s;o that we were oblig'd to let her go before the Tempe&s;t, and tru&s;t to the Mercy of Heav'n for Relief.

We, in the Middle of the Storm di&s;|cover'd Land right a Head, which put us all into our Pannicks; we endeavour'd to bring our Ve&s;&s;el to bear up to the Wind, but all to no Purpo&s;e; for &s;he &s;till drove nearer the Shore, where we di&s;co|ver'd &s;everal Tokens of a Shipwreck, as Pieces of broken Ma&s;ts, and Barrels &s;wiming on the Water, and a little far|ther Mens Hats; then we began to think we &s;hou'd certainly run the &s;ame Fate, when as &s;oon as thought our Bark was drove on Shore, in a &s;mooth &s;andy Bay, but where we had Opportunity to quit her, which was happy for us; for the Sea wa&s;h'd over her with &s;uch Violence, we had not any Hopes of her e&s;caping the Storm, but thought of Cour&s;e we &s;hou'd be torn to Pieces.</P>
<P>When we were a-Shore, we all con|cluded it cou'd be no other Part but the South of <HI>Cuba I&s;land,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> We were then in a terrible Fright, le&s;t we were near any Part that belong'd to the <HI>Indians;</HI> for Mr. <HI>Mu&s;|grave</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd me, that there were &s;ome Parts of the South&punc;Side of <HI>Cuba,</HI> that <HI>In|dians</HI>

After travelling about ten Miles to the N. W. we di&s;cover'd a Path, upon which a Halt was commanded, and to retire in
<PB N="115" REF="193">
to the Woods again till Night; which we did, and din'd upon what Fruits we cou'd get upon the Trees.</P>
<P>About two Hours before Night a Dog &s;mell'd us out, and running away from us, bark'd mo&s;t furiou&s;ly; upon that we were afraid of being di&s;cover'd, which Fear prov'd true; for in Half an Hour, or thereabouts, after the Dog left us, we were &s;aluted with &s;everal Ar|rows and Mu&s;quet-Shot, that kill'd us three Men, and wounded me in the Foot, but it prov'd the Means of &s;aving my Life: For as &s;oon as our Men perceiv'd what had happen'd, they ran as hard as they cou'd to meet the Danger, as knowing they cou'd do no Good till they came to Handy-Blows; I, in endeavouring to follow 'em, found my Hurt, which pre|vented my keeping up with the re&s;t; but I cou'd hear and &s;ee 'em at it: There was about Two Hundred <HI>Indians</HI> &s;et up|on our Men, and in about Half an Hour kill'd 'em every One. I &s;aw the Cap|tain lay about him de&s;perately, but at la&s;t fell, being run thro' the Throat with a Wooden Stake. As &s;oon as ever they had
<PB N="116" REF="194">
conquer'd 'em. or rather murder'd 'em, they fell to &s;triping of 'em as fa&s;t as they cou'd, and carry'd 'em off, together with their own Dead, which were many, for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;old their Lives very dearly.</P>
<P>After they were all gone, which I &s;ound by their Screeming and Noi&s;e at a Di&s;tance, I ventur'd to &s;teal out from be|hind a Row of Bu&s;hes, where I had plac'd my &s;elf to &s;ee what had happen'd; I went to the Place of Battle, where I found two of our Men that they had left, with all their Arms, and &s;ome of their own; &s;o I took up one of their be&s;t Mu&s;quets, and a Cutla&s;s, and made far|ther into the Wood, for fear of being caught; which I had certainly been, if I had &s;taid a Quarter of an Hour longer, for I &s;oon heard 'em come Hooping, Scream|ing and Hollowing back, to fetch the o|ther two Bodies, and their Arms, as I conjectur'd.</P>
<P>I walk'd as far as my hurt Foot wou'd let me that Night, and out of Danger of the <HI>Indians</HI> as I thought, and then lay'd me down to &s;leep as well as I cou'd, be|ing
<PB N="117" REF="195">
very hungry, and &s;adly tir'd, and &s;lept pretty well till Morning, when I proceeded forward in my painful Jour|ney, and directed my Cour&s;e N. E. think|ing that was the be&s;t Way to avoid the <HI>In|dians,</HI> and probably to meet with &s;ome <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> whom I knew inhabited towards the North; the <HI>Havanna</HI> the Capital City of the whole I&s;land being &s;eated there. I wander'd for four Days, eating nothing but Fruit in the Woods; but laying my &s;elf down about an Hour ago, to re&s;t my &s;elf a little, I thought I heard the Tongues of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> which to my great Joy prov'd true. I left my Mu&s;|quet behind the Bu&s;hes, for fear of a|larming you; but now after returning God and you Thanks for this time|ly Nouri&s;hment, I'll go and fetch it, which he did; and we might ea&s;ily know it to be an <HI>Indian</HI> Piece, for they had rudely carv'd it all over with &s;everal Figures of Birds and Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Now, &s;aid I to my Companions, you &s;ee the Reward of Wickedne&s;s. He was not &s;uf|fer'd by Providence to go on long in his Crimes, tho' &s;ome are that are inur'd to Ills;
<PB N="118" REF="196">
yet they are overtaken at la&s;t, when their Crimes are full blown; for tho' Ju&s;tice has Leaden Feet, yet they always find he has Iron Hands: And we too often &s;ee that he who kills his Adver&s;ary in a Du|el, tho' he e&s;cape the Law, one time or other meets the &s;ame Fate him&s;elf.</P>
<P>After poor <HI>Plymouth</HI> had refre&s;h'd him|&s;elf, we &s;et forward, and walk'd along till we came to a Road that &s;eem'd to be a Main Road of the I&s;land, by the Large|ne&s;s. Here we con&s;ulted what we &s;hou'd do, whether we &s;hou'd go on, or return for more Provi&s;ion; but we re|&s;olv'd to go a little Di&s;tance from the Road, for fear we &s;hou'd meet with more of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and run the &s;ame Fate with the other <HI>Engli&s;hmen.</HI> But <HI>Ply|mouth</HI> told us, we were a great way from that Place where his Countrymen were kill'd; (for <HI>Plymouth,</HI> tho' born in <HI>Gui|nea,</HI> wou'd always call him&s;elf an <HI>Engli&s;h|man,</HI> as being brought over very young,) &s;o we re&s;olv'd one and all to venture.</P>
<P>We &s;ent up our Prayers to the Almigh|ty for our Safety, and went on with a Faith that we &s;hou'd come off with Succe&s;s;
<PB N="119" REF="197">
but we had not gone far when we heard the Reports of &s;everal Mu&s;quets, and &s;houting in a barbarous Manner, behind us. Looking that Way, we &s;aw a <HI>Mu|latto</HI> riding as fa&s;t as ever his Mule cou'd carry him; when he came up to us, he &s;top'd, and cry'd in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> Make ha&s;te, run, for the <HI>Indians</HI> are coming upon you, they have kill'd &s;everal <HI>Spaniards</HI> already, and they are fighting with them. Mr. <HI>Mu&s;|grave,</HI> who under&s;tood <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> very well, interpreted what he &s;aid to us; he ask'd him how far they were off? He an&s;wer'd ju&s;t by, and hearing another Shout, put Spurs to his Mule, and left us in an In|&s;tant. We found by the Shouting and the Firing, that they wou'd be immedi|ately upon us, &s;o we retir'd out of the Road to let 'em pa&s;s, and laid down up|on our Bellies that they might not di&s;|cover us. Immediately came by about twenty <HI>Spaniards</HI> on Hor&s;eback, pur&s;u'd by near a hundred <HI>Indians:</HI> Ju&s;t as they came by us one <HI>Spaniard</HI> drop'd, and crept in|to a Bu&s;h on the other Side of the Road; and pre&s;ently the <HI>Indians</HI> follow'd, &s;hout|ing in a horrid Manner, and overtook
<PB N="120" REF="198">
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> again, who being very &s;wift on Foot, out-run an ordinary Hor&s;e; and they had thrown away their Fire-Arms, to make them the lighter to run, as we &s;uppos'd. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> knew they wou'd &s;oon overtake 'em, &s;o only run to charge their Pi&s;tols, and &s;tand till they came up; then di&s;charge 'em, to put 'em in Confu&s;ion; and run again, to prolong the time, in Hopes of &s;ome Aid. All this we un|der&s;tood by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that crept into the Bu&s;h undi&s;cover'd by the <HI>Indians,</HI> by Rea&s;on of the Hor&s;es Feet, and the Du&s;t to|gether, he being the Foremo&s;t in Flight. He told us moreover that about three Leagues farther, there was a Fort belonging to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to &s;top the <HI>Indians,</HI> they u&s;ing to make Inroads before that Fort was built, even to the Gates of the Ci|ty <HI>Havanna.</HI> Upon this we con&s;ulted and re&s;olv'd to follow, upon the Edge of the Road, to &s;ee how we cou'd be a&s;|&s;i&s;ting; we &s;oon came even with 'em, for they were in a narrow Place, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> kept 'em at Bay pretty well; by good Fortune there was a high Hedge made by Trees all along as we went,
<PB N="121" REF="199">
which hinder'd us from being di&s;cover'd. Here we re&s;olv'd to fire upon 'em all to|gether, and then run further up, and if po&s;&s;ible get out into the Road and face 'em. Accordingly we agreed to fire four, and three, and the fir&s;t four to charge again immediately. Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave,</HI> Mr. <HI>Middleton,</HI> Mr. <HI>White</HI> and my &s;elf agreed to fire fir&s;t; then <HI>Hood, Rou&s;e</HI> and <HI>Ply|mouth;</HI> which as &s;oon as we had taken good Aim we did, and firing at their Backs, kill'd four downright, and wound|ed &s;everal, for I had order'd 'em to put two Bullets into each Piece. As &s;oon as ever we had fir'd our Mu&s;quets, we let fly one Pi&s;tol each, and then the o|ther three fir'd their Guns. As &s;oon as <HI>Ply|mouth</HI> had fir'd, he ran and charg'd our four Guns, (he having never a Pi&s;tol) and then we let fly our other Pi&s;tols. With the&s;e Di&s;charges we had kill'd at lea&s;t fifteen <HI>Indians,</HI> and put the re&s;t in|to &s;uch Frights that they began to run; (for with the Du&s;t and Bu&s;tle they made, they cou'd hardly di&s;tingui&s;h from whence the Fire came) neither did they &s;top till they met with the poor wounded <HI>Spani|ard,</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="200">
who had crept out, hearing the Di&s;charge of our Pieces, (as we &s;uppos'd) they fell upon the poor Fellow with Shouts and Outcries, and tore him to pieces, never minding the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pur|&s;uing 'em; who cry'd <HI>Miracalo! Miraca|lo!</HI> a Miracle! a Miracle! By this Time we got within twenty Yards of the End of the Hedge, where we Seven fir'd our Mu&s;quets, and left 'em to <HI>Plymouth</HI> to charge; then we ran in upon 'em with our Pi&s;tols, and di&s;charg'd 'em clo&s;e upon 'em. With this la&s;t Fire we drop'd 'em twelve Men, and they &s;cream'd out, and ran away as fa&s;t as they cou'd. We did not think fit to follow 'em, for it was not to any Purpo&s;e, being they were &s;oon out of Sight. We charg'd our Guns and Pi|&s;tols again, and the twelve <HI>Spaniards</HI> did the like, they having Nine in the la&s;t Conflict kill'd, and two de&s;perately wounded. They gave us Thanks for our Re&s;cue, and &s;aid we were &s;urely &s;ent from Heav'n to their Relief; they let us know they were Tax-gatherers for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and were oblig'd to go in Numbers, and well arm'd, for fear of
<PB N="123" REF="201">
the&s;e de&s;perate <HI>Indians;</HI> who, about nine Years ago, &s;et upon 'em and kill'd Eigh|teen of 'em, and but two e&s;cap'd; but never met with any Mole&s;tation from that Time till now; &s;o that this Time (thinking the Danger over) we le&s;&s;en'd our Number from Fifty to Thirty, which I &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Indians</HI> having Notice of, was the Occa&s;ion of their &s;etting upon us. They &s;aid it was to no Pur|po&s;e for to go back, for the re&s;t of their Companions that were kill'd, which being a Mile of, they had taken with 'em.</P>
<P>We had not gone above half a League onward, but we heard dreadful Shout|ings as before, and looking behind us, it being a &s;trait Road, we cou'd perceive a Cloud of Du&s;t, and the <HI>Indians</HI> running full Speed towards us. Upon which, we put down our two wounded Men that were on Hor&s;eback, and mounted upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;pare Hor&s;es. Now we being nineteen Hor&s;emen, re&s;olv'd to &s;tand it: We divided into Ranks, four in a Rank, which made five Ranks; only there was but three in the la&s;t Rank. So we re&s;olv'd to keep directly one behind the other, and when the fir&s;t File had
<PB N="124" REF="202">
fir'd to fall in the Rear, and charge a|gain. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> wou'd make up the three fir&s;t Ranks, as they &s;aid they cou'd not in Honour expo&s;e us to the fir&s;t On|&s;et, being we ventur'd our Lives in com|ing to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance. We had no Time to di&s;pute for now they were ju&s;t upon us, and to our Surprize had &s;everal Fire Arms among 'em. As &s;oon as they got within a Hundred Paces of us they fir'd, but not above two of their Pieces went off, the re&s;t were clog'd with Du&s;t in running, that very happily for us hin|der'd their Di&s;charging. The Shot mi&s;s'd us by Providence, and we wou'd not give 'em Time to charge again, but we mov'd forward and fir'd in upon 'em, and did great Execution; when it came to our Turn to fire, we in the Heat forgot our Orders, but after we had di&s;charg'd our Guns and Pi&s;tols, we fell in with 'em with our Cutla&s;&s;es, and being rais'd a|bove 'em by being on Hor&s;eback, did great Execution; and that with the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> charging and firing again, put 'em to the Rout; but now we follow'd 'em being on Hor&s;eback, and di&s;pers'd 'em
<PB N="125" REF="203">
&s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible for 'em to rally any more that Night. However we took four of 'em Pri&s;oners, and tying their Hands behind 'em, fa&s;ten'd 'em to two of our foremo&s;t Hor&s;es, the re&s;t following after, that they might not get Loo&s;e.</P>
<P>We were met in the Road by twenty <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, with each a Foot-Soldier behind 'em, who were upon the full Gal|lop to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, being alarm'd by the <HI>Mulatto</HI> that rode by; but I believe &s;ome were glad they came too late. The Officer and the re&s;t &s;aluted us very courteou&s;ly, when they heard how lucki|ly we came to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but fell a whipping the poor naked <HI>Indians</HI> &s;o barbarou&s;ly, that tho' they de&s;erv'd it, I cou'd not bear to &s;ee it done in cold Blood, and tho' the Blood follow'd every La&s;h, yet they never cry'd out. This is the chief Cau&s;e of the Hatred of the <HI>Indians,</HI> when ever the <HI>Spaniards</HI> get any of 'em in their Power, they put 'em to all man|ner of Torture; but if, on the contrary, they would u&s;e 'em civilly, and di&s;|charge 'em now and then, I am &s;ure they might live in perfect Friend&s;hip with 'em:
<PB N="126" REF="204">
For the <HI>Indians</HI> are good-natur'd, loving and affable, till they are incens'd, and then they are implacable.</P>
<P>We arriv'd at the Fort about Evening, and were very well entertain'd. The Officer did not doubt but to procure us a Ship&punc; to tran&s;port us to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> tho' they had Orders from <HI>Havanna</HI> to &s;ecure all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, there being a War talk'd of between the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Dutch.</HI> The next Day the Officer mightily brag'd of being an old <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that is, born in <HI>Spain,</HI> and of an ancient Family; and Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> made us very merry upon the Road, in interpreting the Don's Speeches. We found all along from the Fort, a great many Gentlemens Hou&s;es plea&s;antly &s;itu|ated, and the Country all along yield|ing delightful Pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>We were well entertain'd at a Gentle|man's Hou&s;e at Dinner, with Provi&s;ions dre&s;s'd after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Way, and all manner of Sweetmeats and cool Wines. The Gentleman had a Vault or Cellar thirty Foot deep under Ground. He &s;poke pretty good <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and had been
<PB N="127" REF="205">
a Factor &s;everal Years in <HI>London,</HI> and knew our Cu&s;toms and Manners very well, and prefer'd our Way of dre&s;&s;ing Victuals before their own. He had an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cook from a <HI>Tavern</HI> behind the <HI>Royal-Exchange,</HI> that he brought with him into <HI>Spain,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Cuba,</HI> where he had a va&s;t E&s;tate left him. His Cook's Name was <HI>Hodges,</HI> a good under&s;tanding Fellow, and made very much of us, and wou'd fain have had us to &s;tay with his Ma&s;ter longer. But as &s;oon as we had din'd, we were oblig'd to get on Hor&s;eback, and away for the <HI>Havanna,</HI> which we reach'd about &s;ix a-Clock in the Evening. We had Rooms alloted us, and &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Men came to &s;ee us, that liv'd there.</P>
<P><HI>Havanna</HI> is the Capital City of the whole I&s;land of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and has as great a Trade as any Place belonging to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> It has one of the fine&s;t Harbours in the Univer&s;e, not for its Greatne&s;s, but its Security, yet able to contain five hundred Ships of the greate&s;t Burthen. The Mouth of
<PB N="128" REF="206">
the Harbour is commanded by a Plat|form, and a &s;quare Fort, fa&s;ten'd toge|ther by a &s;trong Boom, or Iron Chain, that no Ship can enter. The mo&s;t &s;hal|low Part of the whole Harbour, is eight Fathom Water, and all its Banks is pav'd round with flat Stone, &s;o that a Ve&s;&s;el of a Thou&s;and Tun may lay her Side to it and unlade. Ju&s;t between the two Forts there &s;tands a round Water Tower, where they di&s;cover to the Town how many Ve&s;&s;els are coming towards the Harbour by putting out a Flag for eve|ry Ship. This Place is the be&s;t fortify'd and garri&s;on'd in all the <HI>Indies,</HI> to &s;ecure the Plate Fleet, and all other Ships that meet here, to &s;et Sail altogether for <HI>Spain.</HI> This City is very large, near as big as <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and the Hou|&s;es are hand&s;omely built, but after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion. There are Two hand|&s;ome Churches, fine, and well built, with Spires, and an Organ in each, be|&s;ides &s;everal Chappels; and a Foundati|en laid for a third Church while we were there. This City almo&s;t as &s;oon as it was built, was &s;ack'd by a <HI>French</HI>

Pyrate in the Year 1536, who was dri|ven thither by a Tempe&s;t, and landing his Men well arm'd, took the City in Spite of all their Re&s;i&s;tance, and burnt many of the Hou&s;es, they being mo&s;t part Wood; and had con&s;um'd 'em all, had not the <HI>Spaniards</HI> redeem'd the re&s;t by paying 'em a Thou&s;and Ducats. Upon the receiving of the Money, they made out to Sea, and the &s;ame Evening came into the <HI>Havanna</HI> three Ships from <HI>Spain,</HI> who hearing of what had chanc'd, prepar'd to follow 'em, taking &s;everal Soldiers on Board 'em; the Admiral, who &s;ail'd be&s;t, got the fir&s;t Sight of the <HI>Frenchman;</HI> but being fearful to attack him before the other Ships came up, lay by. The <HI>Frenchman</HI> &s;eeing that, boldly &s;et upon the fir&s;t Ship, and took her without fighting; the &s;econd, &s;eeing that, tack'd about, and ran a-Shore, which was taken by the Ship's Boat; the third al&s;o run the &s;ame Fate. Flu&s;h'd with this Succe&s;s, they return'd to the <HI>Havan|na</HI> the &s;econd time, and exacted a Thou&s;and <HI>Ducats</HI> more, or el&s;e they threaten'd to level the City with the Ground, which
<PB N="130" REF="208">
was paid 'em immediately. Then they took their la&s;t Leave, with this rich Booty, and &s;ail'd for <HI>Rochel</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> where they &s;har'd their Prizes. After this they built their Hou&s;es with Stone, as they are now, which neverthele&s;s the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> took about twelve Years af|ter.</P>
<P>There are many fair Harbours be&s;ides the <HI>Havanna,</HI> in <HI>Cuba,</HI> as that of St. <HI>Jago</HI> City and Harbour, which is a hand&s;ome Place, &s;eated on the South of the I&s;land, and is al&s;o a Bi&s;hop's See under the Archbi&s;hoprick of St. <HI>Domin|go.</HI> Three Leagues from St. <HI>Jago</HI> lies tho&s;e famous Copper Mountains, call'd by the <HI>Spaniards, Sierra de Cobre.</HI> There's another Town and Harbour &s;ituated on the Ea&s;tern Part of <HI>Cuba,</HI> call'd <HI>Baracoa,</HI> where they gather the be&s;t Ebony of all the <HI>Indies.</HI> There's many other good ones, as St. <HI>Salvador, Trinedad, Puerto del Principe,</HI> which has a Fountain near it, that &s;ome times of the Year produces Liquid Pitch.</P>

Peopl'd than any other I&s;land in <HI>America,</HI> before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> invaded 'em; but now there are but few <HI>Indians,</HI> which inhabit &s;everal Parts of the I&s;land unmo|le&s;ted by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but the Natives can never forget their Barbarity, which they have by Tradition from Father to Son. Nay, I have been inform'd that they keep a &s;olemn Fe&s;tival once a Year, which was the Time that the Ma&s;&s;acre of the <HI>Indians</HI> happen'd; and if they can get any <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they &s;acrifice 'em to &s;atisfy <HI>the Manes</HI> of their dead Ance|&s;tors.</P>
<P><HI>Hugh Lin&s;coten,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Voyager, relates that a <HI>Ca&s;&s;ick,</HI> or one of the Lords of a Province, caught a <HI>Spani|ard</HI> at their fir&s;t Landing, and threw him into a River, to &s;ee if he wou'd drown, which he did, and that &s;atisfy'd him they were not Immortal.

<P>_WE were told our Ve&s;&s;el was ready, and therefore might be going when we pleas'd. It was a very neat one as ever was built by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and carried be|tween thirteen and fourteen Tun.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="216">
We had all &s;orts of Provi&s;ion &s;ent on Board for half a Year, or more, &s;o that we only &s;tay'd for the Wind to ri&s;e, it being quite calm.</P>
<P>While we &s;tay'd there, the four unfor|tunate <HI>Indians</HI> were to be executed in the mid&s;t of the <HI>Parade.</HI> They were fir&s;t to be drag'd by four Hor&s;es, naked, along the great Street to the <HI>Parade,</HI> and then to be chain'd to a Po&s;t, fix'd for that Purpo&s;e, and burnt to Death: I mu&s;t confe&s;s, when I &s;aw with what barbarous Cruelty they de&s;ign'd to u&s;e 'em, I repented my being an In&s;tru|ment in the taking of 'em. This Execu|tion was order'd to be between &s;even and eight in the Evening, being then it was coole&s;t: All the <HI>Indian</HI> Slaves that &s;erv'd <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ma&s;ters in the Town, were order|ed to go and be Spectators of the Trage|dy, that they might &s;ee what they mu&s;t expect, if they ever offer'd to Rebel in the like manner. When the Time came, the whole Street was crowded with a va&s;t Number of People of all Conditions. But &s;uch a Sight I never de&s;ire to &s;ee again, each <HI>Indian</HI> was ty'd by the Feet to the Harna&s;s of the Hor&s;e, and &s;o drag'd from
<PB N="3" REF="217">
the Pri&s;on to the Place of Execution up|on the bare Stones naked, their Arms tied upon their Brea&s;ts, and fa&s;ten'd upon their Backs, that they might not lift 'em up to &s;ave them&s;elves as they were dragg'd along the Stones; but by that time the poor Creatures came to the <HI>Pa|rade,</HI> their Skin of their Legs, Thighs, and Back, were almo&s;t &s;trip'd off, yet with|out the lea&s;t Complaint; As &s;oon as they were ty'd fa&s;t to the Stake, they took from a Pot of Liquid Pitch, boiling hot, a Stick with &s;omething fa&s;ten'd to the End on't, and rub'd over their naked Bodies. One of them then, I ob&s;erv'd, began to faint, but was rated by another of his Fellow Sufferers in their own Language, which none under&s;tood but <HI>Indians,</HI> and the Fellow &s;eem'd to bear it much better. Before the Fire was put to the Pile, a Fryer &s;tep'd up to them, and in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;poke to the <HI>Indian</HI> that was ready to faint before, who had been Servant in the Town, but run away from his Ma&s;ter, and under|&s;tood <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI> The Fryer de&s;ir'd 'em, if they would be happy in the other World, to acknowledge them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, and

Up|on this the <HI>Indian</HI> an&s;wer'd, <Q REND="margQuotes">When I li|ved among you (&s;aid he) and was taught to wor&s;hip your God, you told me he was an upright God, and a ju&s;t God to them that &s;erv'd him Faithfully, but an avenging Power to tho&s;e that once Of|fended him: If &s;o, how comes it to pa&s;s that he has not puni&s;h'd you for all your Crimes. You have taught me, that Whoring and Adultery were Sins not to be Par|don'd, and yet you commit tho&s;e Sins, as if you were in no fear of any Pu|ni&s;hment.

<P>When all was over, Father <HI>Antonio</HI> took us home to his Lodgings, to give us a &s;mall Collation for the la&s;t time, being the next Day, we did All de&s;ign to lie on Board, in Expectation of the Winds ri&s;ing. We told him by Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave,</HI> That we thought it a great Weakne&s;s in them to preach in that manner, to <HI>Indians</HI> in their Condition, and it would be apt to make others de&s;pi&s;e their Religion; &s;ays Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave,</HI> it is like courting a Woman to Love by Stripes; (pardon the Compari&s;on) Why, &s;ays Father <HI>Antonio,</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s it is not what any of our Fathers like, but it is what we are order'd to do, and therefore mu&s;t not be deny'd. Be&s;ides at fir&s;t, it was a piece of barbarous Policy in the fir&s;t Conquerors of the <HI>Indies,</HI> they would order the Mi&s;&s;ionaries to preach to

all <HI>Indian</HI> Criminals, but out of hearing of any Spectators; &s;o as &s;oon as they were executed, they would declare to all the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they died Chri&s;tians, and were happy. Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave,</HI> ask'd him, What made them u&s;e 'em &s;o inhumanely, was it not enough that they &s;uffer'd Death, but mu&s;t be tortur'd in that bar|barous Manner? He replied, It was done to terrifie the other <HI>Indians</HI> from any Vio|lence. Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> an&s;wer'd, That was certainly wrong, for as they are an implacable &s;ort of People, and have hand|ed down to them from Father to Son, the fir&s;t Ma&s;&s;acre, tho' almo&s;t Two hun|dred Years ago, they mu&s;t needs remem|ber, the&s;e Cruelties of &s;o fre&s;h a Date, which revives in their Memories the for|mer, if they had any Mind to forget 'em: He could not &s;ay much to it, he &s;aid, but evaded the Di&s;cour&s;e, by bidding us be merry, that is innocently and di&s;offen|&s;ively &s;o, for he did not allow of Di&s;|orders in any one; &s;o we refre&s;h'd our &s;elves, and took our Leaves of the good Father, who Ble&s;s'd, and Embrac'd us, and &s;aid he would pray to Heaven for

our pro&s;perous Voyage: So on the next Day, we paid our hearty Acknowledg|ments to all our Benefactors, and went on Board; where we had not been a Quarter of an Hour, before an extraordinary Me&s;|&s;age came from the Governor for <HI>Ply|mouth,</HI> our Black, who went with them without any He&s;itation, and return'd with a Pre&s;ent from the Governor, of &s;everal Bottles of Rack, <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wines, Fowls, Rice, and Brandy, with twenty Pieces of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gold, as the Me&s;&s;enger told us, in Recompen&s;e for the Lo&s;s of one of our Companions; for the Governor had &s;ent for <HI>Plymouth,</HI> to know if he would &s;erve him in Quality of his Trumpeter, and he would &s;ettle a Pen&s;ion upon him for Life. <HI>Plymouth</HI> thought fit to accept of it, as ha|ving no Ma&s;ter, nor knowing when he &s;hould have one: But he got leave to come on Board to bid us farewel which he did in a very Affectionate manner. I bid him have a care to plea&s;e the <HI>Gover|nor,</HI> and then he need not fear doing well; &s;o we parted with <HI>Plymouth,</HI> with our hearty Thanks recommended to Fa|ther <HI>Antonio</HI> for all his Favours. <HI>Ply|mouth</HI>

had a Trumpet given him by the Governor, as &s;oon as he came on &s;hore, which he brought with him, and &s;ounded all the Way in the Boat, as he went back again to oblige us; for really he &s;ounded extraordinary well, and had learnt on &s;e|veral other In&s;truments, having a tolera|ble Under&s;tanding in Mu&s;ick. We were &s;orry to part with <HI>Plymouth,</HI> as being a faithful hone&s;t Fellow, yet glad he had got &s;o good a Ma&s;ter.

<P>This famous I&s;land of <HI>Cuba,</HI> which was fir&s;t call'd <HI>Joanna</HI> by <HI>Columbus</HI> the fir&s;t Di&s;coverer, afterwards <HI>Fernandina,</HI> then <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> as being the Fir&s;t and La&s;t I&s;land the <HI>Spaniards</HI> touch'd at: But afterwards was call'd <HI>Cuba,</HI> and &s;till re|tains that Name. This is reckon'd one of the Four I&s;lands of the <HI>Barlovento.</HI> The others are <HI>Hi&s;paniolo, Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>Porto-Rico.</HI> The North Side of <HI>Cuba</HI> is fortifi|ed with a va&s;t Number of &s;mall I&s;lands, call'd the <HI>Lucaies,</HI> which &s;ome Geogra|phers
<PB N="9" REF="223">
have taken for a Part of the main Land. The chief is <HI>Bahama,</HI> which forms the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> the Pa&s;&s;age that all Ships go through, when they come out of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> into <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cuba</HI> has on the North, <HI>Jucatan,</HI> a Pro|vince on the main Land, di&s;tant about 50 Leagues, and on the South <HI>Jamaica,</HI> about 40 Leagues: In length 220, and in the broade&s;t Part about 56. The Soil in mo&s;t Parts, that are inhabited by <HI>Spaniards,</HI> is Fruitful, and much more Healthy than <HI>Hi&s;paniola.</HI> The Tobacco is reckon'd the be&s;t in the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies.</HI> I have &s;een very large Vines there, which bear excellent Grapes, but not fit to make Wine; many have tried, but it turns &s;our in a few Days. And for Birds, Bea&s;ts, and Fi&s;hes, it comes up to, if not exceeds any of the other I&s;lands. The Bird <HI>Flamingo</HI> is a Fowl &s;omething bigger than our ordinary Gee&s;e, but Legs and Neck twice as long, and all over red, and generally go in a Body at a Di&s;tance, they look like a Company of Soldiers march|ing. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have a Proverb here, That the Time will come that <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="224">
Men will walk as freely in their Streets, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do now; if it were &s;o, it would be of a prodigious Advan|tage to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> being the <HI>Havana</HI> is a Strait that Commands all the Ships that come out of the <HI>Indies</HI> for <HI>Europe,</HI> and I really think from what I have &s;een, that it would be in the Power of Ten thou&s;and Men, with a Fleet proportionable, to o|vercome the whole I&s;land in a little Time. Be&s;ides it is ob&s;erv'd, that there are more Prizes brought into the <HI>Havana,</HI> than any four Havens in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>While we were at the <HI>Havana,</HI> a <HI>Spa|niard</HI> carried two &s;trange Bea&s;ts about the Streets for a Show, that he brought from <HI>Brazil,</HI> the one was call'd <HI>Ai,</HI> with a Head &s;omething re&s;embling that of a Man's, and cover'd with rough &s;hort gray Hair: Each Foot has three Claws clo&s;e together, about a Finger long, very &s;harp Teeth, with a &s;mooth high black No&s;e, very &s;mall &s;leepy Eyes, and no Ears, with a Tail &s;mall above, and broad at the Bottom, with Hair all over the Body of an A&s;h colour. This Bea&s;t is about the Size of a large Fox, but &s;o lazy a Crea|ture, that when it gets up a Tree, it ne|ver
<PB N="11" REF="225">
comes down&punc;till it has devour'd every Leaf, and when it has done, it will &s;it there twenty Days together without eat|ing, and almo&s;t &s;tarv'd before it will take the pains to go down to feed. It can't travel or creep in a whole Day not above a Quar|ter of a Mile. This that was &s;hown to us, never would &s;tir till rouz'd with a &s;tick, and it would be a&s;leep again in an In&s;tant.</P>
<P>The other Creature was &s;omething like a <HI>Baboon,</HI> but con&s;iderably larger, with a Face and long Beard, like an old Man's, and hairy like a Goat, all over the Body; his Ears bald, his Eyes black, large and Sparkling. He that &s;how'd it to us, call'd it a <HI>Cayon,</HI> its Tail is about four or five Foot long, which they twi&s;t round a Tree, and &s;o fling them&s;elves to the next. They are very Fierce and Subtile, and when Wounded, will &s;et upon their Adver&s;ary without any Fear; and if forc'd to climb the Trees, they carry their Mouths and Hands full of Stones to throw at Travel|lers as they pa&s;s by; and when wounded, they &s;et up a &s;hriek, that immediately brings all of their Kind, within Hearing, to their Succour, who &s;top the Wound

with Leaves and Mo&s;s, which will &s;oon be heal'd. This that we &s;aw was brought up very young by the Per&s;on that had him, and would play many comical Tricks; As he was &s;hown to us, he urin'd in his Paw and threw it in our Faces, before we were aware, and while I was a wiping mine, he gave me &s;uch a Salute with his Tail, that made me &s;tand farther off, which &s;eem'd to plea&s;e him mightily, for he look'd at me and chatter'd, as much as to &s;ay, I have given it you. The <HI>Spa|niard</HI> told us, they us'd to play at a cer|tain Game with the Natives for Money, and would often win, and then go &s;pend what they had got, upon a Liquor that made them Drunk, and as &s;oon as they found them&s;elves &s;o, they would retire very decently, and take a Nap, by which they were very often caught.</P>
<P><HI>Jo&s;eph de Acosta,</HI> that wrote the Hi&s;to|ry of the <HI>West-Indies</HI> in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> tells a Story of one of the&s;e Sort of Creatures, going to a Tavern, with a Pot, and Mo|ney to pay for his Wine&punc; yet would not part with his Money, till they had fill'd his Pot with the Wine; but in the mean time beat
<PB N="13" REF="227">
four or five Boys, that did their Endea|vour to take it from him, and carried it &s;afe to them that &s;ent him.</P>
<P><HI>Peter Martyr</HI> relates another Story of one of them, that &s;eeing a <HI>Spaniard</HI> go|ing to fire a Gun at him, &s;natch'd up a little Child that was there, and held it before him as a Buckler, and would not let it go before the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was retir'd; then he laid the Child gently down, and ran away, after having fir&s;t Urin'd upon it.</P>
<P>The Fellow that &s;how'd them, &s;old 'em to the Governor of <HI>Havana</HI> for Two hun|dred Dollars, and would have gone with us to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> or any where; but we dur&s;t not take him without an Order from the Governor, who does not &s;uffer any one to go out of the I&s;land without a Pa&s;s from him, which co&s;ts a Dollar, and brings into his Pur&s;e a great deal of Mo|ney in the Year, having no other Reve|nue from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> only &s;o much a Year for a Table, and a Pallace ready furni&s;h'd with every thing that is nece&s;&s;ary, be&s;ides Servants. Every Ship that comes in pays two Dollars, and at
<PB N="14" REF="228">
going out four more, &s;o that the Govern|ment of this I&s;land exceeds in its Profit any other Government (except the Vice Roy of <HI>Mexico)</HI> in the <HI>Spani&s;h West-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>The Weather continued favourable, &s;o that we arriv'd at <HI>Jamaica</HI> without meet|ing any thing remarkable in our Pa&s;&s;age: As &s;oon as we had ca&s;t Anchor, I order'd the Boat to be made ready to carry me on Board my own Ship, which I &s;aw Ride there. But when I got up the Ship-&s;ide, I found my Cloaths &s;elling at the Ma&s;t, at, <HI>Who bids more?</HI> which is the Method, as &s;oon as a Per&s;on is dead, or kill'd; the fir&s;t Harbour they Anchor in, the Cloaths of the Deceas'd are brought upon Deck, and Sold by Auction, the Money to be paid when they come to <HI>England,</HI> for it generally happens that Sailors have not any till they come Home again.</P>
<P>They were at the la&s;t Article when I came up the Ship-&s;ide; which was a pair of black wor&s;ted Stockings that co&s;t I be|lieve about four Shillings, which went at twelve and Six-pence, tho' they had been worn. As &s;oon as I was &s;een by 'em,
<PB N="15" REF="229">
&s;ome cry'd out a Gho&s;t! a Gho&s;t! and o|thers ran away to &s;ecure the Cloaths they had bought, &s;u&s;pecting that now I wou'd have 'em again. When they were &s;a|tisfy'd of my being alive, and were told my Story, they were all rejoic'd at my good Fortune, but none would be pre|vail'd upon to let me have my Cloaths a|gain. So I took up the Slop-Book and ca&s;t up what they were &s;old for, and found, that what co&s;t me about twenty Pound, were &s;old for four times the Mo|ney: When I was &s;atisfied in that, I cal|led every Per&s;on, one by one, that had bought any of my Cloaths, and &s;truck a Bar|gain with them for ready Money, and bought them for about ten Pound; but the ready Money pleas'd them mightily.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Wa&s;e</HI> being &s;ick a&s;hore, I went to pay him a Vi&s;it, where he was mighty glad to &s;ee me, as believing I had peri&s;h'd; he told me that the Ve&s;&s;el hung Lights out for &s;everal Hours, that I might know where to &s;wim, and laid by as long as the Wind would permit, as the Crew acquainted him when they came into Harbour. The Captain told me, That he did not think
<PB N="16" REF="230">
he &s;hould live long, therefore was mighty glad I was come to take Charge of the Ship, which had &s;ail'd before, if he had been in a Condition to bear the Sea. From thence I went on Board my new Bark, and &s;ettled my Affairs there with my Companions, who were mighty &s;orry to think of parting with me, <HI>Hood</HI> and <HI>Rou&s;e</HI> de&s;ir'd they might be receiv'd on Board as Sailors, and go for <HI>England</HI> with us; for <HI>Hood</HI> was an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> I mean born in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Rou&s;e</HI> had Friends there. Be&s;ides it was as ea&s;ie to go from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Bermudas,</HI> as from <HI>Jamaica.</HI> So I &s;poke to the Captain, who was very well pleas'd to receive them, being he had lo&s;t five Men by the Di&s;temper of the Country. The poor Captain died in a Week after my coming, and left me Exe|cutor for his Wife, who liv'd at <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had Buried him, I went on Board with my two Men, and did de|&s;ign to Sail in three Days at farthe&s;t, which I would have done before, but that I was hinder'd by wanting a Chapman for our Bark, being we had Shares to di&s;po&s;e of; when I came on Board, the Ma&s;ter told
<PB N="17" REF="231">
me, he had no Occa&s;ion for the two Men to add to their Charge; &s;ays I, that's as I &s;hall think fit, for the Power is in my Hands now; And who put that Power into your Hands? (&s;ays the Ma&s;ter) He that had the Power &s;o to do (&s;ays I) the Captain, whereupon I &s;hew'd him in Writing. He told me it did not &s;igni|fy any thing, and that he would find no one of the Sailors would obey a Boy, un|capable to &s;teer a Ve&s;&s;el. Says I, I don't de&s;ire to have any Command over you, but only to repre&s;ent the Captain that's de|ceas'd: We have no want of any Repre|&s;entatives (replies the Ma&s;ter) and you &s;hall go in your own Station, or not at all. It would be a pretty thing, added he, for my Mate to become my Captain, and as I was de&s;ign'd by the Captain to have the Command of the Ve&s;&s;el before you came, &s;o I intend to keep it. But &s;ays I, this Paper &s;ign'd by his own Hand, is but of two Days Date, and you can't &s;how any thing for the Command, as you pretend to: Therefore (&s;ays I) I'll make my Complaint to the Governor, and he &s;hall Right me. Ay, ay, do &s;o!
<PB N="18" REF="232">
(&s;ays he) I'll &s;tand to any thing he &s;hall Command. Whereupon <HI>Rou&s;e, Hood,</HI> and my &s;elf went into the Boat again, and row'd immediately on Shore; but the Go|vernor was &s;ix Miles up in the Country, and it being pretty late, we de&s;ign'd to wait for his coming home, which we were told would be in the Morning early. So I went on board the Bark, and laid all Night, the Ship lying beyond the Keys two Leagues from the Harbour, in order to &s;ail. The next Morning getting up, with an Intent to wait upon the Governor, and looking towards the Place where the Ship lay over Night, found &s;he was gone, and ca&s;ting my Eyes towards Sea, &s;aw a Ship 4 or 5 Leagues di&s;tant from us, which we &s;uppos'd to be ours. I immediately went on Shore, and found the Governor ju&s;t come to Town, and made my Complaint. He told me there was no Remedy, but to &s;end immediately to <HI>Blewfields Bay,</HI> where he &s;up|po&s;ed they would &s;top to get Wood, which was u&s;ual with our Ships that were bound for <HI>England:</HI> Whereupon there was a Me&s;|&s;enger order'd for <HI>Blewfields,</HI> which I ac|companied, to give In&s;tructions to the
<PB N="19" REF="233">
Officer that commanded at the Fort, to &s;eize the Ma&s;ter of the Ship, and order him before the Governor at <HI>Port-Royal:</HI> So we got on Hor&s;eback, and reach'd it in three Days, it being almo&s;t a hundred Miles. When we came there, we found &s;everal Ships in the Harbour, but none that we wanted: So we waited a Week, but all to no Purpo&s;e, for &s;he pa&s;t the Bay, as mi&s;tru&s;ting our De&s;ign; upon this we were oblig'd to return with a heavy Heart, and tell the Governor of our ill Succe&s;s. Who pitied me, and told me he would &s;ee me &s;hip'd in the fir&s;t Ve&s;&s;el bound for <HI>England:</HI> So I went on board my own Bark, where they were all glad to &s;ee me, tho' &s;orry I was &s;o di&s;appoint|ed. Now I was very glad that I had not di&s;pos'd of my Bark, for I thought now it might be of u&s;e to me. We con&s;ulted together, to know what was be&s;t to do; at la&s;t I made a Bargain with them, if they would venture with me in our Bark to <HI>England,</HI> I wou'd give them not only my Share of her, but as much Money as came to the other two Shares, if they would be willing to part with them: Upon this
<PB N="20" REF="234">
we agreed, and with what Money I had, I began to lade my Ve&s;&s;el with Things to Traffick with. I bought a good Quantity of Indigo, &s;ome Cotton, Sugar, and Rum.

<SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM on board the <HI>Granado</HI> Mer|chant in <HI>Port-Royal</HI> Harbour, I doubt not but you will hear both from <HI>Garret</HI>'s and <HI>Bris</HI>'s Coffee-Hou&s;e, of the great Calamity that hath befallen this I&s;land by a terrible Earthquake on the 7<HI>th,</HI> In&s;tant. Which have thrown down almo&s;t all the Hou&s;es, Churches, Sugar Works, Mills and Bridges, thro' the whole Country; it tore the Rocks and Mountains, and de&s;troy'd &s;ome whole Plantations, and threw them into the Sea; but <HI>Port-Royal</HI> had much the greater Share in this terrible Judgment of God. I will therefore be more particular in gi|ving
<PB N="22" REF="236">
you an account of its Proceeding, that you may know what my Danger was, and how unexpected my Pre&s;ervati|on. On <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 7<HI>th,</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> I had been at Church reading Prayers, (which I did every Day) &s;ince I was <HI>Rector of</HI> PORT-ROYAL, to keep up &s;ome <HI>&s;how</HI> of Religion among&s;t a mo&s;t Ungodly, and debauch'd People. When Prayers being ended, I went to a Place hard by the Church, (where Merchants u&s;e to meet) where the Pre&s;ident of the Council was, who acts in Chief till we have a new Governor; came into my Company, and engag'd me to take a Gla&s;s of Worm|wood-Wine with him, as a whet before Dinner. He being my very good Friend, I &s;tay'd with him; upon which, he lighted a Pipe of Tobacco, which he was pretty long taking, and not being will|ing to leave him before it was out; I was detain'd from going to one Captain <HI>Rudder</HI>'s where I was to Dine; who&s;e Hou&s;e upon the fir&s;t Concu&s;&s;ion &s;unk into the Earth, then into the Sea, with his Wife and Family, and &s;ome others that came to Dinner with him. But to
<PB N="23" REF="237">
return to the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> and his Pipe of Tobacco, before it was out, I found the Ground rolling and moving&punc; underneath my Feet; upon which I &s;aid to him, Lord, Sir! What's this? He reply'd very compo&s;edly, being a very grave Man; it is an Earthquake, be not afraid it will be &s;oon over; but it did encrea&s;e every Minute, and we heard the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Tower</HI> fall; upon which we ran to &s;ave our &s;elves. I quickly lo&s;t him and made towards <HI>Morgan</HI>'s-<HI>Fort,</HI> which be|ing a wide open Place, I thought to be there more &s;ecure from the falling Hou&s;es; but as I made towards it, I &s;aw the Earth open and &s;wallow up a Multitude of People, and the Sea mount|ing in upon us over the Fortifications. I then laid a&s;ide all hopes of e&s;caping, and re&s;olv'd to make towards my own Lodging, and there to meet Death in as good a Po&s;ture as I could, but I was forc'd to cro&s;s and run thro' two or three narrow Streets, the <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> and <HI>Walls</HI> fell on each &s;ide me, &s;ome <HI>Bricks</HI> came rolling over my <HI>Shoes</HI> but none hurt me: When I came to my Lodging
<PB N="24" REF="238">
I found all things in the &s;ame Order I left them in, not a Picture (of which there were &s;everal fair ones in my Chamber) being out of it's Place. I went to the <HI>Balcony</HI> to view the Street in which our Hou&s;e &s;tood, I &s;aw never a Hou&s;e down, nor the Ground &s;o much as crack'd. The People &s;eeing me there cry'd out to me to come and Pray with 'em. When I was come into the Street every one lead hold on my Cloaths and Embrac'd me, that with their fear and kindne&s;s I was almo&s;t &s;tiffled. I per|&s;uaded 'em at la&s;t to kneel down, and make a large Ring, which they did: I Pray'd with them near an Hour, when I was almo&s;t &s;pent with the Exerci&s;e, they brought me a Chair; the Earth working all the while with new Moti|ons, and trembling like the rolling of the Sea; in&s;omuch, that &s;ometimes whil&s;t I was at Prayer, I cou'd hardly keep my &s;elf upon my Knees by that time I had been half an Hour longer, &s;etting before 'em their many and hei|nous Sins. Some Merchants came to me, who de&s;ir'd me to go Aboard &s;ome

The next Day I went from Ship to Ship to vi&s;it tho&s;e that were taken up in Boats brui&s;ed, and Dying, and to Pray with 'em, al&s;o to do the la&s;t Office to them, in &s;aying the Form of Prayer that is us'd at the Burial of the Dead, which hath been my &s;orrowful Employment ever &s;ince I came Aboard this Ship, with de&s;ign to come for <HI>England;</HI> we

It is a &s;ad Sight to &s;ee &s;uch a fair Harbour cover'd with the dead Bodies of the People of all Conditions; for our great and fa|mous Burial Place, the Palli&s;adoes, was de&s;troyed by the Earthquake, and the Sea wa&s;h'd the Carca&s;&s;es of tho&s;e that were there Buried, out of their Graves.

I believe this was the mo&s;t terrible Earthquake that has ever happen'd &s;ince the Creation of the World, and did more Damage. They tell a Story of a wicked Fellow, that in the Time of the Earth|quake ravi&s;hed a Merchant's Daughter, and after murder'd her, that he might not be di&s;cover'd; but a Black that hap|pened to be in another Room, and hear|ing what had happen'd, ran away to the Ship where her Father was to give him Notice, that he might come and appre|hend him. But when he came and found his Daughter murder'd and the Villain gone, he was almo&s;t Di&s;tracted, and the Hou&s;e tumbling with the Earthquake, he peri&s;h'd in the Ruins bemoaning his Daugh|ter. The execrable Wretch was &s;oon overtaken with Divine Vengeance; for go|ing to make his E&s;cape, a large Stone from one of the falling Hou&s;es, dropt on his Back and broke it, where he was ta|ken up in &s;uch Mi&s;ery, that he prayed for &s;ome one to knock him on the Head to put him out of his Torture. The Pain was &s;o violent, that it took away his Sen&s;es, and in the height of his Ra|ving,
<PB N="33" REF="247">
di&s;cover'd him&s;elf to be the Author of the horrid Fact mention'd; but he died without Repentance, cur&s;ing every Bo|dy.</P>
<P>Another Story that was told me, was, That a Gentlewoman had come out of the Country to lye-in there, being &s;he would be better accommodated, and was brought to Bed but two Days before. The Husband was gone out; and at the fir&s;t &s;hock of the Hou&s;e all her Ser|vants left her, with the Infant with her, which with the Violence of the &s;hock, was overturn'd in the Cradle: With this Ac|cident, the Gentlewoman in a Fright ro&s;e out of her Bed, tho' in a weak Con|dition, and took up her Child, and feeling the Hou&s;e totter, ran down Stairs in her Shift, with her Infant in her Arms, where &s;he was met by her Husband, who took her in his Arms to carry her away, ju&s;t as the Hou&s;e fell upon them all, where they were drawn out, but the Child was dead, and the Mother died in half an Hour, the Husband mightily brui&s;ed, with much Pain linger'd out to the next
<PB N="34" REF="248">
Day, and then expir'd, and were all three buried together in one Grave.</P>
<P>One <HI>Abraham Matthews,</HI> an Inhabi|tant of <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> that was alive when I was there, told me of a remarkable Providence that happen'd to him, as he was packing up &s;everal Things to carry on Board &s;ome Ve&s;&s;el that was in the Har|bour, for the more Security. He had no &s;ooner come out of the Hou&s;e where he lodg'd, but it fell down and &s;mother'd &s;everal People within. Ju&s;t as he got to the Water-&s;ide, the Boat was going off, and as he put one Foot into the Boat, the Boat-Man pu&s;h'd him out again, and told him he mu&s;t &s;tay till he came back, being the Boat was full. The Boat in turning the Point by the Fort was over|whelm'd by a Point of the Shore, which fell upon it, and all that were in't pe|ri&s;h'd. This was the &s;econd Deliverance. When he &s;aw what had happen'd, he re|tir'd to the Church, which was open, to return God Thanks; and beg his farther Protection, or if Death happen'd, he could not choo&s;e a better Place to die in. While he was at Prayers, he &s;aw one of the
<PB N="35" REF="249">
<HI>Buccaniers,</HI> or Thieves, &s;tealing away his Bundle, which he immediately fol|lowed, &s;eiz'd, and took it from him: As &s;oon as he was out of the Church, that fell to the Ground. When he had got the Bundle, he kneel'd upon the Earth to tie it fa&s;ter, the adjacent Hou&s;e &s;unk down al&s;o and &s;mother'd the Fellow, with &s;everal others that were in't. Going a little farther he met &s;ome of his Acquaintance, who were getting a <HI>Canoe</HI> ready to convey them&s;elves on Board a Ship in the Harbour, where he &s;afely arriv'd, and gave God Thanks for his many and happy Deliverances.</P>
<P>We put in at <HI>Blewfields-Bay,</HI> for the Con|veniency of Wood and Water, and when we were provided, &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e on|ward for <HI>England.</HI> But as we came within ten Leagues of the <HI>Havana,</HI> a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of War of Forty Guns came up with us, who commanded us to &s;trike our Sails, which we did immediately, and coming on Board us, were &s;urpriz'd to find us all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-Men, not expecting other than <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the building of our Ve&s;&s;el. Whereupon they made us all Pri&s;oners, and &s;ent fif|teen
<PB N="36" REF="250">
Men on Board us to carry the Ve&s;|&s;el into the <HI>Havana.</HI> Telling 'em how we came by the Ve&s;&s;el did not &s;ignify any thing, for they &s;aid we were Pyrates, and had &s;eiz'd it. And our Pa&s;s which we had from the Go|vernor of the <HI>Havana,</HI> not being to be found, made Things appear but with an indifferent Face; we were afraid we &s;hould find many Difficulties in getting our Liberty, e&s;pecially if they went to their Station, which was St. <HI>Jago.</HI> But it happen'd better than we expected, for &s;he made direct|ly to the Port of the <HI>Havana,</HI> where we knew every thing would be plac'd in a true Light again. When we were anchor'd, and the People could come on Board us, we were &s;oon known, and the Captain going to the Governor, was &s;oon inform'd of the Matter; &s;o we were releas'd immediately, and had a Vi&s;it made us from Father <HI>Antonio,</HI> and hone&s;t <HI>Plymouth,</HI> who were mightily rejoic'd to &s;ee us.</P>
<P>We were detain'd two Days, before we could get away: And then we &s;et Sail with a brisk Gale, fir&s;t &s;aluting the Town with our 4 Guns, and 4 Patter|aroes, which I had forgot to mention our buying at <HI>Port-Royal.</HI></P>

In two Days after our fir&s;t Sailing we made Cape <HI>Florida,</HI> and entred the Gulph that bears the &s;ame Name, and pa&s;s'd it without Danger.

We had not much time to con&s;ult what to do, for they gain'd upon us every Moment. Now Death, or &s;omething wor&s;e than Death, glar'd us in the Face, and mo&s;t of us thought this the la&s;t Day we had to live.

We charg'd our 4 Guns with double and round, and our Patter|aroes with Musket-Balls: The re&s;t of our Arms we got in readine&s;s, and re&s;olv'd to Die fighting, and not &s;uffer our &s;elves to be taken, to be mi&s;erably Butcher'd, as all the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Florida</HI> do, when they get any Whites in their Power. We re&s;olv'd to fire our &s;ix Muskets upon 'em, as &s;oon as they came within reach; &s;o we took our aim, two to each <HI>Canoe,</HI> and fir'd upon 'em, which did 'em &s;ome Dam|age, for they &s;top'd upon it: Which made us make the be&s;t of our way, but they &s;oon pur&s;u'd us with loud and rude Shouts. By this time, we had charg'd our Muskets again, and fir'd as before at the &s;ame di&s;tance; but whatever damage we did 'em, they came on as fa&s;t as they cou'd, but not before we had charg'd our Pieces the third Time, which we fir'd as before, but did more Execution, as being nearer to us; and now we charg'd 'em

There is only this to be &s;aid, that there is not &s;o many Inhabitants, &s;o there is more Plenty of every thing for human Life: Their chief Trade is Fi&s;h, but they &s;end great Quantities of Musk, Sa|bles, and other Furrs.

<P>After being here two Days we &s;et Sail, and made our Cour&s;e for <HI>England, July</HI> 25<HI>th,</HI> 1700.

Gale; we Anchor'd over-again&s;t <HI>Shade|well</HI> Dock. Now all that we had to do was to get Chapmen for our Goods; I applied my &s;elf to a Merchant upon <HI>Change,</HI> who &s;oon &s;truck a Bargain, and with the Con&s;ent of my Companions, &s;old the Lading, bottom and all, for Nine hundred and twenty Pound; reck|oning the Lading Seven hundred Pound, which was my own, and two hundred and twenty for the Ve&s;&s;el, and every thing be&s;ides. They were all contented with their Dividend, but &s;till re&s;olv'd to go with me to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> to &s;ee after my Affairs there: So we &s;et out on foot, intending to walk it, and be a little Mer|ry upon the Road, for we expected more Diver&s;ion by walking it lea&s;urely, than going in any other manner.

thro' <HI>Ba&s;ing-&s;toke,</HI> a Sailor met us begging Charity for God's &s;ake: I gave him Six-pence, which he return'd me ma|ny thanks for; I ask'd him how it came to pa&s;s, that a lu&s;ty Sailor as he was did not go to Sea, (e&s;pecially now War be|ing talk'd of between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French)</HI> He an&s;wer'd he was going to <HI>London</HI> for that intent, but was oblig'd to be beholding to good Men's Charity to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his Journey. Why, pur|&s;u'd I, have you no Friends, your Cloaths are good, you don't &s;eem to have beg'd long. No an&s;wer'd he, this is my fir&s;t Day, I made an end of the little Mo|ney I had la&s;t Night.

From <HI>Ja|maica,</HI> (&s;ays I) Pray what Ship? The

<HI>Albion</HI> Frigate reply'd he, Who was your Captain? added I. The Captain dy'd at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> but the Ma&s;ter &s;upply'd his Place, one <HI>Jacob Bingley.</HI> Did you ever hear of one <HI>Falconer?</HI> Yes, he was the Mate &s;uppos'd to be lo&s;t in a Voyage he made to the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> but coming &s;afe into Harbour afterwards, the Captain before his Death gave him the Command of our Ship; but the Ma&s;ter not approving of &s;uch a young Man to have the Power over him, &s;et Sail without him: This I learn'd on Board afterwards, for I and another Sailor were hir'd for the Voyage that Afternoon, before the Morn|ing we &s;et Sail. We had but an indiffe|rent Pa&s;&s;age the whole Voyage, which was made up with nothing but Storms, and Calms, that caus'd a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s and our Provi&s;ion receiv'd Damage by the Salt-water, which drove us to the la&s;t Extremity; and when we were rais'd in our Hopes of &s;etting our Feet upon our native Country, we were devour'd by the tempe&s;tuous Waves: I my &s;elf was taken up for Dead upon the Shore by a Fi&s;herman. Have you any Friends (&s;ays

I) at <HI>London?</HI> None, (reply'd he) every Place to me is Home, a Sailor is never out of his way; if &s;o, return with us to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> where we are bound, and I'll promi&s;e you if I can't get you a Ship, I'll give you where withal to carry you to <HI>London</HI> without begging. We ea&s;ily agreed upon the Matter, and hone&s;t Tarr went on with us. I ask'd him why he did not endeavour to get a Ship at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> he an&s;wer'd, he wou'd rather chu&s;e to go in a Man of War, than a Merchant Man, &s;ince War was approaching, and he heard there was a Fleet fitting out for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and if &s;o, (&s;ays he) there may be &s;ome hopes of getting &s;ome|thing there, either of <HI>Jack Spaniard,</HI> or <HI>Jack Frenchman.</HI> We came to <HI>Bruton,</HI> and took Lodgings in the <HI>Magpye-Inn,</HI> where I vi&s;ited all my Acquaintance; and from thence we went in the &s;ame manner to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> where the fir&s;t thing was to en|quire after my poor Father; But I was in|form'd by Captain <HI>Pultney,</HI> that he thought he was certainly Dead: Tho' he had &s;een him but once &s;ince I had been Abroad, and that was in the <HI>January</HI> before; when he

<P>Grief &s;o overcame me for a time, that I was not able to &s;peak; to be rob'd of a Father, and a Father I lov'd &s;o dearly, was a cutting Stroke; and I was con|&s;train'd to make u&s;e of all my young Phi|lo&s;ophy to &s;upport it. My Father had left the Writing of his E&s;tate with Cap|tain <HI>Pultney:</HI> He having only Mortgag'd it before for five hundred Pound, to a Friend to prevent its being &s;eiz'd on by

the Crown, which was redeem'd by the Captain by my Father's Appointment, when he came to &s;ee him la&s;t. I paid him his five hundred Pound, and wou'd have given him Intere&s;t for it, but he wou'd not accept of it, but advis'd me to part with it, without I de&s;ign'd to &s;ettle in <HI>England,</HI> which I thought was the be&s;t way, whether I &s;taid in <HI>England</HI> or not. The Captain undertook the Matter, and &s;old it for four Thou&s;and Pound. But whil&s;t he was bu&s;ie about it, I got Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave,</HI> who was always my bo&s;om Friend to go to <HI>Hereford,</HI> and if it 'twere po&s;&s;ible to find where my dear Father was bury'd, and to &s;ee how Matters &s;tood there. Accordingly we hir'd a couple of Hor&s;es, and &s;et out; when we arriv'd at <HI>Hereford,</HI> we found it not a little diffi|cult, but at la&s;t thro' the means of one Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> Organi&s;t of the Cathedral Church, we had &s;ight of the Place, which was about half a Mile from the City: Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> came by the knowledge of it by the means of an hone&s;t Clergyman, that my Father had con|tracted a Friend&s;hip with, before that un|happy Accident befell him that depriv'd him
<PB N="54" REF="268">
of his Life. He brought us to his Hou&s;e, where the Gentleman was laid up with a fit of the Gout; as &s;oon as we were private, I let him know who I was, upon which, he tenderly Embrac'd me, and was mightily joy'd to &s;ee the Son of his late Friend. Says he, I &s;hou'd have been at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> e're now, but that the Gout prevented me: Your Father was a Man I had but a &s;hort Acquaintance with, yet that little time di&s;cover'd him to be a Man of Integri|ty, Hone&s;ty and Honour. When He was upon his death Bed, he told me his real Name, and Circum&s;tances, and what Misfortunes had brought him to this Part; he told me al&s;o, that he had a Son at Sea, and beg'd of me to di&s;po&s;e of his little Fortune he had here, and &s;ee it put into the Hands of Captain <HI>Pultney</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which I had done, but was pre|vented as I &s;aid before, by this &s;udden Fit of the Gout. I have taken care of all your Father's Effects, and the little Farm I have bought my &s;elf, it being for my turn. Upon that, he &s;ent his Maid for a little Box which he unlock'd, and told me out two hundred Guineas; this
<PB N="55" REF="269">
is what your Father left in ready Money behind him: His Farm, &amp;c. I rate at two hundred and fifty pound more, there are the Writings, and there is the Money. By the Writings I &s;aw it co&s;t my Father, but two hundred Pound; as for his Ap|parel and other little nece&s;&s;aries, I gave them by his Order to a Maid Servant, and a Man that he hir'd; and for his Goods, there is but few, nor have we made an E&s;timate of them; but if you'll have them Prais'd, I will give &s;omething more than what they are valu'd at, being I wou'd willingly have them along with the Hou&s;e. Says I, neither &s;hall they be parted, and if you plea&s;e to except of them, be they what the will you &s;hall be heartily welcome: He refus'd them ob|&s;tinately, but I prevail'd with him to take them with much ado; he al&s;o gave me a Ring which I priz'd mightily, becau&s;e it had been my Father's from his Infancy, given him by my Grandfather. When he had &s;ettl'd every thing, I went to &s;ee the Place where my Father's Bones were laid, which fill'd me with &s;uch awful Sor|row, that I cou'd not refrain from Weep|ing
<PB N="56" REF="270">
in &s;pight of my Re&s;olution to the contrary. I wou'd have Erected a Tomb, or Monument for him, but it was his la&s;t Reque&s;t that he might be Bury'd as ob|&s;curely, as he did de&s;ign to live there.</P>
<P>After parting with my Father's Grave with a load of Sorrow, we took leave of my Friend the Par&s;on, and Mr. <HI>Hall,</HI> and rode for <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> again; but were over|taken about &s;ix Miles from <HI>Hereford</HI> by three Gentlemen of the Pad, that had got &s;ome notice of the Booty they &s;hou'd gain if they cou'd Rob us, for I was &s;o In|advertent as to put all my Money into my Bags which I wore before me at my Sad|dle; they pa&s;t us fir&s;t, but looking wi&s;h|fully upon us, gave us &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of what they were. Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> advis'd me to ride back again, and &s;tay &s;till we had more Company; but I told him they wou'd &s;oon overtake us, and &s;eeing us fearful wou'd make them more Re&s;olute, &s;o I rather cho&s;e to face them, for we ob|&s;erv'd they were returning to meet us. We re&s;olv'd to be before hand with them, and we drew out our Pi&s;tols ready, and if they offer'd to come too near us to begin
<PB N="57" REF="271">
with them. As &s;oon as they came with|in 20 Yards of us, I call'd to them, and ask'd them what they wanted; if it was our Money, they &s;hou'd fir&s;t take our Lives; they an&s;wer'd, they had no &s;uch Intention; Than what is your Rea&s;on of pa&s;&s;ing us fir&s;t, and then meeting us again? They an&s;wer'd, one of their Compani|ons in lighting to ea&s;e him&s;elf below the Hill had drop'd his Watch, and they were returning to find it if they cou'd. Why then pa&s;s by in the Name of God, (&s;ays I) and accordingly they did; but we were cautious of letting them come too near us; as &s;oon as they were pa&s;t us, we &s;et Spurs to our Hor&s;es, and got over the Heath before we look'd behind us; but riding lea&s;urely thro' the Village, we &s;aw them coming after a full Gallop. Now we repented we had not &s;tay'd in the Village; but we re&s;olv'd as before to encounter them if they A&s;&s;aulted us: The &s;oon overtook us, and coming even with us, told us their Companion had found his Watch, which he pull'd out and &s;how'd us. They &s;aid they cou'd not blame us in taking them for Highway-Men;
<PB N="58" REF="272">
but they a&s;&s;ur'd us, they were Tra|vellers as we were, and were going to <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI> We did not make any Words with them, but rode along with them, indeed, becau&s;e we cou'd not help it: They rode with us for about a Mile, and then the Road going narrow, one of them pretending to go foremo&s;t &s;eiz'd hold of my Bridle, with the Surprize, my Hor&s;e being a very good one, ro&s;e up an end; and he di&s;charging his Pi&s;tol, the Ball graz'd upon my Cloak-Bag, and did not do any farther Damage. Upon this I fir'd one of my Pi&s;tols but mi&s;s'd him, but I threw it at him with all my force, which hit him on the Head &s;o full, that he &s;tagger'd a little and fell from his Hor&s;e: The other di&s;charg'd a Pocket-Pi&s;tol at me, and Wounded me &s;lightly in the left Shoulder; but going to di&s;charge another, I &s;et Spurs to my Hor&s;e, and had the good Fortune to &s;natch it from him, but in the bu&s;tle between us it went off, and &s;hot the other Highway-Man's Hor&s;e in the Head; which &s;o en|rag'd him, that he ran away with him in &s;pight of all he cou'd to &s;top him.

<HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> who engag'd with him, follow'd him, but con&s;idering he had left me with two, return'd again, and in very good time; for the other Fellow that I had knock'd down with my Pi&s;tol, had got up again, and had ju&s;t caught his Hor&s;e that was grazing under the Hedge. His o|ther Companion that I had taken the Pi|&s;tol from, had&punc; drawn a broad cutting Sword, and was laying at me; I by good Fortune had before me a great Coat for fear of Rain, and the ball of his Pi&s;tol had broke the Strap, &s;o that I wrap'd it round my left Arm, and receiv'd his Blow, which did me no damage, and in the mean time thru&s;t my Sword into his Side up to the Hilt, which neverthele&s;s did not kill him. But he call'd to his Companion; come <HI>Harry</HI> let's make off, for by G&mdash;d I believe I'm kill'd: Accord|ingly they fled as fa&s;t as ever they cou'd back again, the way we came, with my Sword in his Brea&s;t; for when he receiv'd the Wound, he turn'd &s;o &s;hort with his Hor&s;e, that wrung the Hilt out of my Hand.

We &s;tay'd at <HI>Glo&s;ter</HI> two Days to have my Wound dre&s;s'd, and then rode to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> where all our Friends waited impatiently for us, being we had exceeded our Time three Days, after having &s;ettled my Money in the Hands of People, that the Captain appointed to Improve it for me. I re&s;olv'd to make a Trip to <HI>Ireland</HI> to &s;ee my Si&s;ter that was marry'd very well to a Merchant there: But hearing of the Grand Fleet making Preparation for &s;ome Expedition, put us all agog, and my na|tural Genius for Travel, made me once more re&s;olve to be Gadding. I open'd my Mind to Captain <HI>Pultney,</HI> who advis'd me to the contrary; but I told him I was &s;o much concern'd for my Father's Death, (as indeed I was) that I &s;hou'd &s;ooner wear it off at Sea, than on Shore, being here every Object that I &s;aw put me in

mind of Him. He was very well &s;atisfy'd with my Rea&s;ons at la&s;t; but, &s;ays He, I wou'd not have you go in any Po&s;t, but as a Voluntier, that you may not be con|fin'd to &s;tay longer than you &s;hou'd de&s;ire. I thought this the be&s;t way, therefore re|&s;olv'd for <HI>London</HI> with all my Companions, and get us a Ship. I had Letters of Recom|mendations to Secretary <HI>Burchet,</HI> and &s;e|veral Gentlemen that had the Management of the <HI>Navy.</HI> We arriv'd at <HI>London February</HI> the 8<HI>th,</HI> 1701, Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> and I enter'd on Board the <HI>Breda,</HI> Captain <HI>Fog</HI> Com|mander, becau&s;e we were inform'd Admi|ral <HI>Benbow</HI> wou'd hoi&s;t his Flag in that Ship. Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> having formerly had &s;ome Acquaintance with the Admiral, waited on him, and had a Warrant for a Quarter-Ma&s;ter given him. The re&s;t of our Companions enter'd before the Ma&s;t, that is, Common Sailors in the &s;ame Ship. <HI>Hood</HI> was &s;oon made Cook's Mate, and the re&s;t of 'em got &s;ome little Office, that rais'd 'em &s;omething above the Common Sailors, tho' they enter'd as &s;uch, and all by the means of Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave,</HI> who acquainted the Admiral with their Fortunes. When
<PB N="63" REF="277">
we had &s;ent all our Things on Board, and not knowing when they wou'd Sail, Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> and I got leave to go to <HI>Port&s;|mouth</HI> by Land, where we arriv'd on <HI>Sa|turday March</HI> the 3<HI>d,</HI> and &s;tay'd there till the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet arriv'd. A Squa|dron was order'd out to Crui&s;e, of which our Ship was one, but an unlucky Acci|dent hinder'd my going with her, (but Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> was forc'd to go again&s;t his Inclinations, and leave me behind him;) which was as follows. One Evening coming from &s;eeing a Play at the Bull's Head, a Gentleman coming out with a Lady, the Croud by chance jo&s;tled me a|gain&s;t the Lady, which this Gentleman Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> (Nephew to <HI>Johnny Gib&s;on,</HI> Gover|nor of the Place) took as an Affront put up|on him, being he had the Care of the Lady; but I begg'd her Pardon, and told her it was an Accident I cou'd not help; but he being in a &s;trange Pa&s;&s;ion, call'd me &s;eve|ral genteel Names, as Rogue, Ra&s;cal, and &s;uch like, and &s;truck me over the Head with his Cane, tho' I did not much mind his Words; I did not care to take his Blows without a Return, which I did with
<PB N="64" REF="278">
Intere&s;t, and we were &s;oon parted. But an Hour after, being at the afore&s;aid <HI>Bull-Head</HI> at Supper, the Drawer came up and told us, There was a Gentleman below de&s;ir'd to &s;peak one Word to Mr. <HI>Falconer;</HI> there was one Mr. <HI>Langley,</HI> Lieutenant to the <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Man of War, that I had made an acquaintance with at the Play, that promis'd to come and &s;up with us, and I took the Me&s;&s;age to come from him, but was &s;urpriz'd to find it, the Gentleman that I had the Bu&s;tle with. He wanted to drink a Gla&s;s of Wine withme He &s;aid, and led me into a Room; when we were there, he told me he came for Satisfaction of the Affront I put upon him about an Hour ago; therefore draw, added he, or I'll run you through. I endeavour'd to pacify him with good Words, yet all to no pur|po&s;e; he made &s;o many Thru&s;ts at me, that I was in danger of my Life; but at la&s;t I di&s;arm'd him, but not without a little Wound in my Arm: As &s;oon as I gave him his Sword again, he pu&s;h'd at me with all the Malice imaginable; and hearing the People from all Parts of the Hou&s;e, coming to &s;ee what was the Mat|ter,
<PB N="65" REF="279">
he clap'd his Back again&s;t the Door to keep 'em out, which They on the o|ther &s;ide broke open, and giving him a pu&s;h, his Brea&s;t ran again&s;t the point of my Sword, which appear'd at his Back, and he fell down without any &s;ign of Life. The People coming in, I was im|mediately &s;ecur'd, and carry'd to Pri&s;on, till they knew whether he wou'd live, or die. I was mightily concern'd, not from any Danger was to be fear'd, but that it wou'd be a hindrance to my Voyage. The Gentleman continu'd in a violent Fever a great while, and his Life was de|&s;pair'd of; but at la&s;t, after a tedious Ill|ne&s;s recover'd, but continu'd weak. One Day he came to vi&s;it me in a Chair, where I was confin'd, and told me He was very &s;orry for what had happen'd, and that to day I &s;hou'd be at liberty; and accordingly came an Order in the After|noon for my Freedom, without paying any Fees. But to my great Grief the Fleet was &s;ail'd, and <HI>Benbow</HI>'s Squadron de&s;ign'd for the <HI>Indies.</HI> But Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> beg'd me to be patient, and he wou'd pro|cure me a Pa&s;&s;age in a Store-Ship that
<PB N="66" REF="280">
wou'd &s;ail in a Week at farthe&s;t for <HI>Ja|maica,</HI> and he was as good as his Word; for the next Day he carry'd me to Cap|tain <HI>Young,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Tyger</HI> Store-Ship, and enter'd me immediately. Then my Heart began to be at Re&s;t, and I gave him Thanks; and for the time we &s;tay'd there, Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> and I were very inti|mate; and he expre&s;s'd him&s;elf &s;o gen|teelly about our former Encounter, that he gain'd my E&s;teem.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ion indeed, is certainly a Madne&s;s; and therefore what is done in that Heat ought to be forgot, if the Per&s;on them|&s;elves repent of it. But how humane it wou'd be, if in the mid&s;t of that Fire of Pa&s;&s;ion which blazes out, they cou'd &s;prinkle the cool Water of Rea&s;on, and quench it? For nothing more deforms the Mind or Body than Pa&s;&s;ion, and 'tis then we lo&s;e our humane Form, and are meta|morphos'd into Bea&s;ts. How many great and good Men have done &s;uch things in Pa&s;&s;ion, that they have repented of all their Lives after. Therefore Pa&s;&s;ion may be well term'd a Pilfering Devil, that &s;teals away our Sen&s;es, and prompts us
<PB N="67" REF="281">
to do Actions unbecoming the Form we bear.</P>
<P>We &s;et Sail from <HI>Spithead May</HI> the 18<HI>th,</HI> 1701, and our Captain gave us hopes of overtaking the Fleet, by rea&s;on he &s;aid, one Ship cou'd make better way than a whole Fleet, being they were oblig'd to wait for one another. We met with no|thing extraordinary but a Storm, that drove us almo&s;t upon the I&s;land <HI>Madera&punc;</HI> which being &s;o nigh, our Captain re&s;olv'd to Anchor at, and accordingly we did in the Bay of the City of <HI>Funzal,</HI> the Capitol of the Place, Captain <HI>Young</HI> and I went on Shore to view the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Funzal,</HI> the Capitol of this I&s;land, is a large hand&s;ome City, with one Cathedral and four other Churches, all neatly Built; two Cloi&s;ters, one for the Men, and the other for the Women. The City contains 1600 Hou&s;es. There is al&s;o computed to be upon this I&s;land 100000 Inhabi|tants. I bought a <HI>Portugueze</HI> Book here that gives a better Account of the fir&s;t Di&s;covery of this I&s;land than any I have &s;een extant, which Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> tran&s;la|ted for me in <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I have &s;een it in

<P>WHEN <HI>England</HI> was &s;ettled in a la&s;ting Peace, after the Tur|moils and Hazard of a dange|gerous War. King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, who conquer'd <HI>France,</HI> and fix'd his Royal Standard in the City of <HI>Paris:</HI> He who had felt the Inconveniences of War, knew how to encourage the Plea&s;ures of Peace, and <HI>London</HI> the Metropolitan City of the Kingdom, became the Seat of Mirth and

Jollity. All thoughts of War were ba|ni&s;h'd; the En&s;igns now were furl'd, and Swords were wore for Ornament, not U&s;e. Among the re&s;t that embelli&s;h'd the Court, was one <HI>Lionel Machin,</HI> the younge&s;t Bro|ther of a noble Family, and con&s;equently not over-rich; yet a Gentleman (which often happens in younger Brothers) that was reckon'd the only Ornament of the Root from whence he &s;prung. This Gentleman fell de&s;perately in Love with a Lady, beautiful to Perfection, and the only Boa&s;t of her Time. But there was a va&s;t Di&s;parity in their Fortunes; for &s;he was the only Daughter to a Noble|man, who&s;e Riches exceeded mo&s;t of his Rank, and con&s;equently courted by tho&s;e that cou'd make her a Joynture equal to the Fortune her Father wou'd give her. But neverthele&s;s the Force of Love is &s;uch, that it never minds Intere&s;t nor Du|ty; and the young Lady, who&s;e Name was <HI>Arabella,</HI> was &s;o much taken with the winning Behaviour of <HI>Lionel,</HI> that &s;he plac'd her entire Affection upon him, who was indeed, bating his &s;lender Means, the mo&s;t de&s;erving of her. But the Parents
<PB N="71" REF="285">
of <HI>Arabella</HI> hearing of the Amity that was between 'em, complain'd to King <HI>Edward,</HI> and beg'd that he wou'd interpo&s;e his Royal Authority. The King us'd many Per&s;wa&s;ions to <HI>Lionel</HI> to withdraw his Af|fections, but it was like bidding the Sun &s;tand &s;till, or the Wind, or Rain, to cea&s;e; for their Affections were &s;o &s;trongly uni|ted, that nothing cou'd ever part 'em. The Father having provided a fit Match for his Daughter, intreated the King to &s;ecure <HI>Lionel</HI> till the Marriage was &s;olem|niz'd, who granted his Reque&s;t, and clapt <HI>Lionel</HI> in Pri&s;on under pretence of &s;ome trea&s;onable Practices. When immediately the Marriage-Rites were perform'd, and <HI>Arabella</HI> was con&s;train'd to give her Hand where it was not in her Power to give her Heart; and Parents are to blame to force their Children to marry again&s;t their Inclinations, being from thence &s;prings &s;uch Di&s;orders in Families that is not in their Power to compo&s;e. As &s;oon as the Ceremony was over, the Husband carry'd his Lady to a Palace, &s;eated upon the River <HI>Severn,</HI> near <HI>Bri&s;tol:</HI> When done, <HI>Lionel</HI> was releas'd out of Pri&s;on,
<PB N="72" REF="286">
but with a heavy Heart, for the Lo&s;s of his dear <HI>Arabella.</HI> But &s;till his Love en|creas'd from the Difficulties he found to obtain his De&s;ire, and knowing it impo&s;|&s;ible to live without her, thought of a Stratagem that gave him hopes of con|quering all Difficulties. He &s;ummon'd a|bout Thirty young Gentlemen, all Re|&s;olute, Bold, and fit for any Undertaking&punc; When he had got 'em all together, he made this &s;hort Oration to 'em:</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">Mo&s;t here are my Relations, or what's a nearer Tye, my Bo&s;om-friends: You all know the Indignity I have &s;uf|fer'd, by <HI>Arabella</HI>'s forc'd Marriage; therefore I require you all to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in whatever I &s;hall undertake (with|out tainting your Honour) to be Re|veng'd for the Affront put upon me. To this Reque&s;t they all agreed to &s;erve him with their Lives and Fortunes.</Q></P>
<P>Whereupon it was re&s;olv'd to part and take &s;everal ways to <HI>Bri&s;tol:</HI> When they all arriv'd at their Place of Rendezvous, they con&s;ulted together, and re&s;olv'd to
<PB N="73" REF="287">
&s;eize any Ship in the River, that they found was fit for their turn. <HI>Lionel</HI> thought nothing difficult when Love was to be the Reward; but now he wanted &s;ome means to let <HI>Arabella</HI> know their De&s;ign: But at la&s;t it was agreed, that one of their Company &s;hou'd enter into the Service of the Husband, which fell out as they cou'd wi&s;h, and a proper Per&s;on was hir'd to be Groom, where he had the care of a fine &s;potted Hor&s;e, that us'd to carry the La|dy abroad, to vi&s;it her Neighbours: The Wind proving fair, notice was given that the Project was to be put in Execution; the pretended Groom, to favour the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, had omitted giving <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Hor&s;e any Water. When <HI>Arabella</HI> had notice of the Hour, &s;he ordered her &s;potted Hor&s;e to be Sadled, under pretence of taking the Air, attended with her Groom, and two more of her Dome&s;ticks. When they came near the Cape of Land, where <HI>Lionel</HI> and his Companions waited for Her; the Hor&s;e by beating of the Waves again&s;t the Shore heard and &s;melt the Water, and made down to it to Drink, where <HI>Lionel</HI> imme|diately lay'd hold of the Lady, (who
<PB N="74" REF="288">
&s;eem'd to be mightily frighten'd) and put her in their Boat and made off. Now the Day that they had &s;eiz'd the Lady, was al&s;o pitch'd on to &s;eize the Ship they had a de&s;ign upon; which was ea&s;ily done, being their Crew were mo&s;t of them a Shore. They cut her Cables, and made off to Sea withal the Sail they cou'd bear, and &s;oon got out of &s;ight, and directed their Cour&s;e for <HI>France,</HI> but a Storm met them and drove them quite contrary. <HI>Li|onel</HI>'s Friends now began to Repent of their Undertaking, and <HI>Lionel</HI> was mighti|ly concern'd for the Danger of Her, he Lov'd more dear than Life; who tho' mightily di&s;order'd with the Sea, yet &s;eem'd contented in having the Object of her De&s;ire with Her. Thirty Days they were the &s;port of the Waves, every Day expecting Death; but one Morning they di&s;cover'd Land, high, craggy, and very Woody, which fill'd them with Joy, more e&s;pecially <HI>Lionel,</HI> for now he hop'd a re&s;ting Place, for his dear <HI>Arabella.</HI> None in the Ship could gue&s;s what Land it cou'd be, for they knew it was not Inhabited, being Birds of all &s;orts
<PB N="75" REF="289">
were &s;o tame, that they would &s;uffer them&s;elves to be taken with the Hand. The Place they cho&s;e for their Habi|tations was a fine Grove of Laurel-Trees that were very delightful, as was al&s;o every part of the Country they had rambled over. Finding they were to &s;tay there a great while, they got out of their Ship &s;everal Nece&s;&s;aries, and liv'd very plea&s;ant for about 13 Days, de&s;igning to commit them&s;elves in a Day or two to the mercy of the Waves, for tho' the I&s;land was delight|ful to live in, yet it &s;eem'd tire&s;ome to tho&s;e that wanted many things they enjoy'd in their own Country.</P>
<P>The Night before they de&s;ign'd to Embark, a violent Storm ro&s;e, and drove the Ship from the I&s;land with about 16 Men that were preparing all things for Sailing the next Day. The&s;e were to&s;t by the Winds and Sea for many Days, but at la&s;t, to their great Joy, di&s;cover'd Land, where they ran their Ship on Shore, being &s;he was &s;o leaky &s;he could hardly Swim. But their Joy for being &s;av'd from the watry Element,
<PB N="76" REF="290">
&s;oon chang'd to Sorrow, when they found them&s;elves taken by the <HI>Moors;</HI> they be|ing Landed on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africk.</HI> Their new Ma&s;ters (after hard u&s;age) arriv'd at the City of <HI>Morocco,</HI> with their Purcha&s;e, where they &s;old them in the Market like <HI>Cows,</HI> or <HI>Oxen;</HI> but all declaring they were Men of Rank, they were Impri&s;on'd, in hopes of large Ran&s;oms.</P>
<P>When <HI>Lionel</HI> and <HI>Arabella,</HI> and the re&s;t that were left on Shore, di&s;cover'd the next Morning their fatal Di&s;a&s;ter; Grief &s;iez'd them with &s;uch a force, that &s;ome of them lo&s;t their Sen&s;es, running Fran|tick up and down the Woods, and raving, kill'd them&s;elves. Poor <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Grief &s;unk inward, and prey'd upon her Life with &s;uch Violence, that Death appear'd to her Re&s;cue: She never upbraided <HI>Li|nel</HI> with her Misfortunes, but clos'd her Eyes with a true Repentance of her fail|ings.</P>
<P><HI>Lionel</HI> was like a di&s;tracted Man, lay'd him&s;elf down at her Feet, and cou'd not be remov'd till Death gave him his Re|lea&s;e. His Companions bury'd them to|gether in one Grave, and at the Foot E|rected

a Cro&s;s, to &s;hew tho&s;e that were Interr'd there, dy'd under the Banner of Chri&s;t: Upon the Bark of the Tree, they cut in Letters the whole Story of their Misfortunes. The re&s;t that remain'd up|on the I&s;land, propos'd to them&s;elves of venturing into their Boat (which by good Fortune was left on Shore) and &s;teer'd their Cour&s;e to the nighe&s;t main Land, where they happily arriv'd without Danger, but ran the &s;ame Fate with their other Companions that were thrown on the &s;ame Coa&s;t in the Ship, that they all thought was ca&s;t away. All the comfort they receiv'd in their Misfortunes, was, that they were committed to the &s;ame Pri&s;on, that their Companions were in. They were over Joy'd to find tho&s;e alive that were thought dead, but mourn'd to think of meeting in &s;uch a melancholly Place. In the &s;ame Pri&s;on was one <HI>Juan de Morales,</HI> a noted Pilot, and an excellent Navigator; this Man was mightily pleas'd with the Tales of the&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentle|men, and &s;o often beg'd them to repeat their Adventures, that he had every Mark of the I&s;land exact, and perfectly

<P>Captain <HI>Young</HI> and I attempted to a|&s;cend it; but there was &s;uch a thick Fog, that we were per&s;waded to the contrary; we went up about a Quarter of a Mile, but were &s;o wet with the Fog, that we had not a dry Thread about us.</P>
<P>When we had &s;atisfy'd our Curio&s;ities as far as we cou'd, we &s;et Sail from <HI>Teneriff</HI> and made our Cour&s;e for the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> We met a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship from <HI>Batavia</HI> that was drove by ill Weather &s;everal Degrees out of her due Cour&s;e; we &s;par'd 'em what Nece&s;&s;aries we cou'd, being they were in great Want, and took our Leaves of 'em.

<PB N="107" REF="321">
a Galley with <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Colours out, Rowing up to us with all their Strength; we were all &s;urpriz'd and amaz'd, and cou'd hardly give credit to our Eyes, being no one on Board us ever heard of a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Galley &s;o far from their own Coa&s;t; but it &s;eems we were nigher <HI>Africk</HI> than we &s;uppos'd, as it prov'd afterwards. Our Captain told us we had nothing to do but fight it to the la&s;t; for if we were taken, we might be Slaves all our Lives long. I advis'd our Captain to put out our Boat, and tow our Ship from 'em: For, &s;ays I, if a Wind does not ri&s;e in the mean time, that we may e&s;cape 'em, yet we &s;hall gain more time to put our &s;elves in Readine&s;s to receive 'em when they come up with us. This Advice was approv'd on, and the Boat was got out immediately with &s;ix Men to Row, and I oblig'd my &s;elf to go along with her to &s;teer her right, that they might Row with all their Strength. We Tow'd &s;o tightly for an Hour, that we made pretty good way with our Ship; but for all our Endeavours, we found that in about ano|ther Hour they wou'd get up with us; but we de&s;ign'd to Row till they were
<PB N="108" REF="322">
within a Quarter of a Mile of us, and then go into the Ship again. In the mean time our Men on Board had pre|par'd every thing, and were in good Or|der to receive 'em. We had &s;ixteen Guns, and forty Men, and Ammunition enough. We were preparing to come on Board, when we found they were almo&s;t up with us, but our Captain advis'd me not, and or|der'd us to have Arms in the Boat, with &s;ome Hand-Granado's; and as &s;oon as we &s;hou'd &s;ee 'em Engag'd, to go to the con|trary Side of the Enemy, and fire upon 'em, and by that means we &s;hou'd amu&s;e 'em, that they wou'd not venture to Board us. Immediately it was agreed, and two more Men together, with our Arms, were put into us. The Galley came up with us in an In&s;tant, and hail'd us in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and bid us &s;trike our Colours immediately, or it &s;hou'd be wor&s;e for us, but were an|&s;wer'd by us with our Cannon, in&s;tead of our Voices, and we went to it. Now to obey my Orders, I loos'd my Tow-Rope, Row'd to get on the other Side of the Galley, but was mightily &s;urpriz'd to find their Boat out, and about the Number of
<PB N="109" REF="323">
twenty <HI>Turks</HI> getting into her, our Men in the Boat advis'd immediately to return, but I told 'em 'twas too late, for it wou'd be wor&s;e for us if we did: Nay, our Captain call'd to us to come on Board, but I thought they wou'd do us more In|jury in getting up the Ship's &s;ide, than if we &s;tood 'em boldly, which we re&s;olv'd to do: There was nine of us, and we had Arms enough; &s;o before they cou'd fire at us, we di&s;charg'd our Muskets at 'em, and laid our &s;elves under the Gunnel of our Boat to charge again: When we were prepar'd, I order'd 'em not to &s;tir till the <HI>Turks</HI> had fired; and as &s;oon as they had done &s;o, to &s;et Fire to the Fuze of their Hand-<HI>Grando's,</HI> and throw 'em upon 'em, as &s;oon as we heard the <HI>Turks</HI> fire, which did us no Damage, we &s;et Fire to our Hand-<HI>Granado's,</HI> as agreed upon, and threw 'em in upon 'em; but they &s;u&s;pect|ing &s;omething, it &s;eems, order'd but half their Number to fire at fir&s;t, and the other half fired upon us &s;o unluckily, when we ro&s;e to di&s;charge our <HI>Granado's,</HI> that they kill'd three of my Men out-right, wounded another dangerou&s;ly, and my &s;elf in the
<PB N="110" REF="324">
left Arm. It is true, our <HI>Granado's</HI> kill'd 'em four, and wounded &s;everal; but &s;till their Number doubled ours, and now they prepar'd to Board us. My four Companions and my &s;elf fired upon 'em with our Pieces, but cou'd not prevent 'em Boarding us; yet we clubb'd our Muskets on both Sides, and fell to work; but a <HI>Turk</HI> coming behind me while I was en|gaging with another, and &s;truck the Cock of his Pi&s;tol into my Skull, and I drop'd down for Dead; but when I came to my &s;elf, which was not in &s;everal Hours, as I was told, I found my &s;elf on Board the Galley,</P>
<P>They had order'd a <HI>Surgeon</HI> to dre&s;s my Wounds, which were three; one in my left Arm, that in my Skull, and ano|ther upon the Side of my Throat, which I did not feel in the receiving. I was or|der'd to be taken particular care of; for being I was not in a Sailor's Habit, they thought I was &s;omething above the re&s;t, and therefore hop'd to get a con&s;iderable Sum for my Ran&s;om. The Surgeon that dre&s;s'd me was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Renegado, who&s;e Name was <HI>Matthews.</HI> The Captain was
<PB N="111" REF="325">
an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> too, born at <HI>Deptford,</HI> but the vile&s;t Wretch &s;ure that ever breath'd. There were &s;everal other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Renega|do's on Board, mo&s;t of 'em profligate Wretches. I under&s;tood from my Sur|geon, that the two Ve&s;&s;els parted after a de&s;parate Engagement, and the <HI>Turks</HI> had above fifty Men kill'd and wounded. Three of my Companions were Pri&s;oners likewi&s;e; the fourth being kill'd in the la&s;t Conflict, and the other expir'd in the Boat with his Wounds. When I began to mend, I walk'd upon Deck, and look'd about me a little; the other three (being well) had renounc'd their Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; he who dy'd for their Sins, and took upon him the State of Man, that he might redeem us mi&s;erable Sinners from the Cur&s;e of the Serpent. What mu&s;t be their Puni&s;hment, who for a little Ea&s;e in this World, forego their Portion of Eternal Life? If the Tortures of Hell have their Degrees, the la&s;t and greate&s;t mu&s;t be their Lot. The Captain of the Galley order'd me one Day to be brought before him on the Deck, where he told me, If I did not in a Twelvemonth procure him to
<PB N="112" REF="326">
the Value of Eight hundred Pound for my Ran&s;om; I &s;hou'd be chain'd to the Oar, and be a Slave all my Life; (it &s;eems one of the Three that was taken with me, had fold him of my Abilities, and that I was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a plentiful Fortune.) I an&s;wer'd, I would &s;end to <HI>England,</HI> and do my Endeavour to get that Sum; but I told him it was more than I was worth, and there was no hopes of &s;o much Money for my Ran&s;om, unle&s;s my Friends wou'd out of Charity contribute towards it. I added, I believ'd I cou'd rai&s;e a Hundred and fifty, or Two hundred Pounds: But he &s;tuck to his Text, and told me, He wou'd bate me nothing of that; and when the Time was expir'd that he had fix'd, if the Money did not come, I &s;hou'd never have my Li|berty. I told him, I wou'd do my Endea|vour to procure it for him when we came into Port, and had liberty to write to my Friends in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain did de&s;ign to Cruize a Month longer, that he might take &s;ome Prize to make him amends for his la&s;t Di&s;appointment. He never importun'd me to for&s;ake my Religion; being, if I
<PB N="113" REF="327">
had been as vile as the others, he wou'd not have had any hopes of my Money to re|deem me. We coa&s;ted off the Shore of <HI>Africk</HI> a Fortnight or three Weeks, but met with no Prize; which enrag'd the Captain very much. One Day the <HI>Sur|geon</HI> dre&s;&s;ing the Wound in my Head, &s;lipt into my Hand a Letter, which he bid me Read cautiou&s;ly, and give him an An&s;wer the next Day. I had not an Op|portunity for &s;everal Hours to Read the Contents; at la&s;t I counterfeited a &s;udden Weakne&s;s, and retir'd to my Cabin, which was in the Place we call the <HI>Foreca&s;tle.</HI> When I laid my &s;elf down, and found no one was near me, I open'd my Letter, and Read the Contents to this Effect:</P>

One of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that has the Keys of the Galley-Slaves Chains is al&s;o one of our Number. Our Project mu&s;t be put &s;peedily in execu|tion, being they'll go into Harbour in Ten

Days, and then it will be impo&s;&s;ible to ef|fect it. We will procure Arms, and give you farther Notice of the Hour. We mu&s;t not &s;eem to conver&s;e together, neither mu&s;t you take it ill if you find we give you ill Language now and then, it being only to in&s;inuate our &s;elves into the good E&s;teem of the <HI>Turks.</HI> When we have redeem'd the Slaves, we &s;hall be Twenty-eight in Num|ber, which will be a &s;ufficient Strength to Cope with the <HI>Turks,</HI> they being but Forty-one in all.

<P><PB N="115" REF="329">
After I had read it, I pray'd to God to Aid us in our De&s;ign. The next Day Mr. <HI>Mat|thews</HI> came to dre&s;s me as before; I gave him to under&s;tand that I had read, and con&s;ider'd the Letter, and told him my Opinion was to execute it as fa&s;t as ever we cou'd, for fear of any Accident that might happen: For, &s;ays I, it is not impo&s;&s;ible but we may meet with one of their own Galleys, and then we &s;hall find it to be a fruitle&s;s Underta|king. Says he, we mu&s;t wait a conveni|ent time; for if we &s;hou'd fail, we mu&s;t expect the wor&s;t of Torments. He went from me upon this, being &s;ome of the <HI>Turks</HI> came to look upon my Wound. The Captain ask'd him how my Hurts far'd? Ah! Dam him, &s;ays he, the Chri|&s;tian Dog will do well enough I warrant him: So much the better, an&s;wer'd the Captain, for I am inform'd he is worth a great deal of Money, and I &s;hall &s;et his Ran&s;om at a higher Rate than what I fir&s;t determin'd. All this Di&s;cour&s;e I heard, being upon Deck, talking with my three Companions that were taken with me, who treated me with ill Language, and call'd me Chri&s;tian Fool, that wou'd not turn
<PB N="116" REF="330">
<HI>Mahometan,</HI> when I might have all the Liberty I de&s;ir'd. One of them carry'd the Je&s;t &s;o far, that he gave me two or three good Strokes with his Hand; but the Captain &s;eeing 'em, &s;aid to 'em, laugh|ing, Let the Fool alone, 'tis not worth your while to foul your Fingers about him. I &s;aid &s;o much to 'em concerning <HI>Maho|met</HI> their Fal&s;e Prophet, that if the <HI>Turks</HI> had under&s;tood me, I might have run the Danger of being murder'd. But generally the <HI>Rengado's,</HI> (that is, tho&s;e that for|&s;ake their Chri&s;tian Faith, and turn <HI>Turks)</HI> have &s;o little of any Religion in 'em, that they laugh at tho&s;e that have any at all. At Night Mr. <HI>Matthews</HI> told me in <HI>French</HI> very low, that the next Morning early was de&s;ign'd for their Enterprize, being it was &s;ome Fa&s;t-day with them, that they u&s;ually at Four a Clock in the Morning ri&s;e, and wa&s;h them&s;elves all over, and pray to their Prophet for &s;ome time; and this being to be done below, they thought then wou'd be the right time. Accord|ingly all that Night they &s;pent &s;ecretly in preparing every thing. He that com|manded the Slaves (which was <HI>Jenkins)</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="331">
found fought with 'em for &s;omething, and cha&s;tiz'd 'em as u&s;ual, but took the Op|portunity to unlock 'em all, and order'd 'em to lie &s;till as if their Chains were fa&s;t, till they had Command to do otherwi&s;e. Every thing &s;ucceeded to our Wi&s;hes, for the <HI>Turks</HI> got up to their Devotion &s;ooner than we expected, even before it was Light; and hudling down together, we clap'd down the Hatches, and &s;ecur'd the be&s;t part of 'em. The Captain, with two <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and one <HI>Frenchman,</HI> were &s;eiz'd in the Cabin, and bound Hands and Feet; and this without any Noi&s;e. About Eight others that had not got up as early as the re&s;t, our Galley-Slaves &s;eiz'd; and before we cou'd prevent 'em, had kill'd 'em all, and beg'd they might &s;erve the Captain and the whole Crew in the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;tle the Slaves made in killing the Eight <HI>Turks,</HI> rouz'd the others below from their Prayers; and when they found they were &s;hut down, they made a Noi&s;e; and knocking to be let out, which we did; but fir&s;t we loaded a great Gun with Musket-&s;hot, and turn'd the Muzzle to|wards
<PB N="118" REF="332">
the Scuttle. Then as they came up, we Bound 'em; but being but few <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> we cou'd not hinder the Slaves from kil|ling &s;everal of the&s;e too. At la&s;t we bound 'em all, being Twenty-five, there being kill'd by the Slaves &s;ixteen; and after|wards, by the Con&s;ent and Agreement of all, we chain'd twenty of 'em to the Oar in the room of tho&s;e we had releas'd; but they began to be very &s;tubborn at fir&s;t, but we put the Slaves to 'em, and they &s;oon made 'em work, by giving 'em the &s;ame U&s;age as they generally us'd to re|ceive from 'em.</P>
<P>When we had &s;ecur'd 'em, we return'd God thanks for our happy Succe&s;s, and then con&s;ulted which way we &s;hou'd &s;teer. We <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> agreed to go for <HI>England,</HI> but the Slaves we redeem'd, being mo&s;tly <HI>Spa|niards</HI> and <HI>Portugueze,</HI> were for going to <HI>Spain;</HI> in &s;hort, there was no agreeing, for they being the greater Number, they pretended to have the Command over us, never con&s;idering 'twas to us they chiefly ow'd their Liberty. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was very much di&s;&s;atisfy'd at their Ingratitude, but cou'd not find any means to help our

&s;elves. Mr. <HI>Matthews</HI> &s;poke to 'em in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and laid before 'em the Benefit it wou'd be for 'em to go for <HI>England;</HI> but it was like Preaching to &s;o many Bea&s;ts, for they regarded him not, but re|&s;olv'd to follow their fir&s;t De&s;ign of di|recting their Cour&s;e for <HI>Spain.</HI> When we found there was no Remedy, we de|&s;ir'd 'em to touch at <HI>Lisbon</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> and &s;et us a&s;hore there; which they con|&s;ented with much intreaty. If we had been of an equal Number, we wou'd have endeavour'd to have forc'd 'em with us for <HI>England,</HI> that they might have repent|ed their Ingratitude.</P>
<P>They wou'd not let any of us have the Command of the Ve&s;&s;el, but one <HI>Ve|la&s;ques</HI> a <HI>Spaniard</HI> was cho&s;en Captain, who immediately turn'd out Mr. <HI>Mat|thews,</HI> that we had given the Captain's Cabin to, and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it him|&s;elf. This &s;et us all a murmuring, and we con&s;ulted to contrive &s;ome way to be even with 'em; but they were &s;o watch|ful, and always upon their Guard, that it was to no purpo&s;e to plot any thing. They us'd to put Centinels upon us every

time we went to Re&s;t. One Night we was awaken'd out of our Sleep by Orders from our new Captain <HI>Vela&s;ques;</HI> when we were upon Deck, he told us there was a Ship di&s;cover'd to the Windward of us. Now my Rea&s;on of &s;ending for you, &s;ays the Captain, is, We de&s;ign to Attack her, and make Prize of her, let her be of what Nation &s;he will, except|ing <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI> When Mr. <HI>Matthews</HI> had told us in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> what he &s;aid, my In|dignation ro&s;e that I cou'd hardly forbear ru&s;hing upon him, and tear his Throat out: But at la&s;t my Rea&s;on conquer'd my Pa&s;&s;ion, and I became calm. I bid Mr. <HI>Matthews</HI> let him know he cou'd not ex|pect us to fight, if they were <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> our Countrymen: But he &s;wore we &s;hou'd fight, or be kill'd, if they were our own Fathers. I bid Mr. <HI>Matthews</HI> tell him, As for my own part, I wou'd not fight a &s;troke, let it be what Nation it wou'd; and for his threatning to kill us, I did not know but it wou'd be better to die, than to Sociate with &s;uch an ungrateful Crew as they were. The Ship now, in|&s;tead of keeping her Cour&s;e, as &s;he did at
<PB N="121" REF="335">
fir&s;t, made all the Sail &s;he cou'd, and bore down upon us, which they did not mind in our Di&s;puting. The Captain then be|gan to change his Tone, and thought it the wi&s;e&s;t way to &s;teer away before the Wind, and endeavour to get from 'em. Whereupon he crowded away, and be|labour'd the poor <HI>Turks</HI> with his Ba&s;tina|do to Row with all their Strength, that I pity'd 'em. Looking towards the Ship that pur&s;u'd us, we cou'd perceive <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours out, which rejoyc'd us <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mightily. We now con&s;ulted how we &s;hou'd &s;top the Galley; for with Sailing and Rowing we went fa&s;ter than they. At la&s;t I re&s;olv'd to take a Pi&s;tol, and &s;hoot him through the Head, let the Con|&s;equence be what it wou'd. So I laid hold of one of the Pi&s;tols unperceiv'd (they having prepar'd their Arms for their En|gagement,) goes up to <HI>Vela&s;ques,</HI> and took him by the Throat with my Left-hand; and holding the Pi&s;tol to his Brea&s;t with my Right, I threatn'd to &s;hoot him Dead if he or his Men offer'd to &s;tir. Several of his Companions were running to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, but were &s;top'd by Mr. <HI>Mat|thews,</HI>
<PB N="122" REF="336">

This Bu&s;tle caus'd the <HI>Turks</HI> to lye upon their Oars, and in the mean tims Mr. <HI>Sloan</HI> brought the Gally to the Wind, and lay'd by, and the Ship got up with us in an In&s;tant, and without hailing us, pour'd in a Broad-&s;ide upon us, which kill'd us two of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and five of our <HI>Spaniards,</HI> among which was that ungrateful Mon&s;ter <HI>Vala&s;ques,</HI> and the wind of one of the Shot threw me down upon Deck without any farther hurt; we had no Colours up at all but the <HI>Vane</HI> upon the Top-ma&s;t Head, which &s;hew'd us to be a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el; I &s;ent up <HI>George Kirk</HI> to take down that, which prevented their Firing again; upon this they haled us: But after we told 'em we were <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> they &s;ent immediately two Boats well arm'd on Board us, and when we had &s;atisfied 'em how it was with us, we &s;eiz'd upon our vile <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> and bound 'em, we &s;aw it was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man of War, and upon enquiry found it was the <HI>Ruby,</HI> Captain <HI>Walton</HI> Commander, bound after the Fleet for

<P>I was very glad of an Opportunity to pur&s;ue my Voyage, I made my Addre&s;s to Captain <HI>Walton,</HI> who very friendly re|ceived me; while we were con&s;ulting what we &s;hou'd do about our Pri&s;oners, the Galley &s;eem'd to lye deeper in the Water, and going to examine her, found a Shot had pierc'd her between Wind and Water, but it was impo&s;&s;ible to come to it to &s;top

it; &s;o we took what we cou'd out of her, and going to unlock the Galley-Slaves Chains, the Key was not to be found, and the Galley was &s;inking every Minute, and before we cou'd break the Chains &s;he &s;unk down right with the whole 20 poor unfortunate <HI>Turks,</HI> and all the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> (who being ty'd) cou'd not help them&s;elves, neither had we time to give 'em any A&s;&s;i&s;tance. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was very much concerned to &s;ee &s;o many poor unfortunate Creatures meet with Death, when it was in our Power ten Minutes before to have &s;av'd 'em. Captain <HI>Walton</HI> was realy griev'd at it, and &s;how'd a Temper full of Humanity.

The other four <HI>Engli&s;h|men</HI> that were In&s;trumental in our Delive|rance, were all <HI>Mahometans</HI> in appear|ance, as I &s;aid before, that is, they for|&s;ook their Chri&s;tianity in outward &s;how, but were realy Chri&s;tians in their Hearts, as was likewi&s;e my three Companions that were taken in the Boat with me, but as they told me they only did it to have &s;ome Opportunity of getting their Liberty, and the Words that were us'd, tho' it was in a Speech they did not under&s;tand, per|fectly &s;hock'd 'em in their utterance, and they all hop'd their Peace was made with God for their Crimes, with a &s;incere Penitence from the moment they had com|mitted it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Matthews</HI> the <HI>Surgeon, George Jenkins, William A&s;hton,</HI> and <HI>Ralph Smallwood,</HI> were taken in a Ship call'd the <HI>Two Brothers</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> bound for <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> after an ob&s;tinate Fight, where

all were kill'd, excepting the abovementi|on'd four, who were taken and &s;old for Slaves, and continu'd &s;o for &s;ome Years; but &s;eizing on a Boat with the four <HI>French|men</HI> that did de&s;ign to venture for their Liberty with 'em, they put to Sea, and rather cho&s;e to tru&s;t in the Waves, and an open Boat, than &s;tay there to be Slaves for ever. But <HI>Hamet</HI> the Renegado, who&s;e Chri&s;tian Name was <HI>Lewis Gordon,</HI> having notice of their flight, follow'd 'em with a &s;wift Galley, and got &s;ight of 'em; Mr. <HI>Matthews</HI> (who relates the Story in this manner) and his Companions &s;eeing it im|po&s;&s;ible to make their E&s;cape, thought of a Stratagem for four of 'em to get the Good-will of the Renegado <HI>Hamet;</HI> which was this: Seeing no likelihood of getting clear off, the four <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> propos'd to the <HI>French</HI> to ca&s;t Lots, and that &s;hou'd de|cide which four &s;hou'd be bound, and the other four &s;hou'd immediately Row back, as if they had no de&s;ign of running away, and make out their Story as well as they cou'd; accordingly we drew, and the Lots fell upon the four <HI>Frenchmen.</HI> Im|mediately we Bound 'em, and Row'd back, and were &s;oon met by the Galley, where
<PB N="127" REF="341">
we made our Tale good, by telling the <HI>Turks,</HI> that going a Fi&s;hing with the four <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> they wou'd have compell'd us by force to have Row'd with 'em in their Boat for <HI>Spain;</HI> but we being not willing, fell to grappling with 'em, and overcame 'em by main force, ty'd 'em, and were bringing 'em back. The <HI>Frenchmen</HI> kept true to their Promi&s;e, and never contra|dicted us in our Story. <HI>Hamet</HI> upon this became very civil to us, and put us in Tru&s;t: He made me immediately Surgeon to the Galley, Mr. <HI>Jenkins</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Slaves, and our two other Companions had &s;ome little Office that pleas'd 'em. We went &s;everal Voyages with him, and took many Ve&s;&s;els, but never met with any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship before the <HI>Tyger</HI> that we had the de&s;perate Engagement with. The four <HI>Frenchmen</HI> were made Slaves to Row in another Galley, which was taken about two Months ago by a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of War, and by that means got their Liberty.</P>
<P>The other two <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and <HI>French|man,</HI> that were taken in the Cabin, con|fe&s;s'd that they had been guilty of many Crimes, but more e&s;pecially in denying

their Saviour; but they now felt in their Hearts and Minds, and Earning to Re|pentance, and beg'd that Captain <HI>Walton</HI> wou'd forgive 'em, and not take their Re|cantation for a Fal&s;hood, being they were in &s;ome danger; but a true Light of the Divine Brightne&s;s. Captain <HI>Walton</HI> freely forgave 'em, and having a Chaplain in the Ship, we re-chri&s;ten'd 'em; and the Fellows &s;eem'd ever afterwards to have a true Sen&s;e of their happy Condition. Captain <HI>Walton,</HI> and my &s;elf, were God|fathers for 'em all. Therefore it behov'd us to &s;ee, that they were now in&s;tructed in their Faith; tho' the&s;e were of &s;ufficient Years to know their Duty without Sure|ties for 'em. We have many People that undergo that Office, but never con&s;ider what their Duty is; and, in &s;hort, make it nothing but an outward Ceremony, when if they thought of it, as they ought to do, they wou'd find it of the utmo&s;t Concern; for the true Office of Sureties, or Godfathers, &amp;c. are to train up the young Plant, till it is capable of bearing Fruit it &s;elf of Good Works. But many now-a-days do as the Turtles do by their

Eggs, lay 'em, cover 'em with Sand, and never more regard 'em.</P>
<P>We came into our old Cour&s;e again, and pur&s;u'd it with &s;ucce&s;s: When we were got into the Latitude of the Tro|pick, we duck'd our Men as before; but there was a great Mutiny of the Sailors: The Captain had three Dogs on Board, and they wou'd have 'em duck'd as well as them&s;elves, unle&s;s he wou'd pay the u&s;ual Rate; which being promis'd 'em, they were compos'd again, and the Sailors and Dogs were reconcil'd without going together by the Ears.</P>
<P>We overtook an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el that had &s;uffer'd much by an Engagement with a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pyrate; &s;he had lo&s;t all her Ma&s;ts, but had rais'd a Jury Main-Ma&s;t, yet cou'd make but little way, by Rea&s;on of her Leaks. Our Captain &s;ent a Boat on Board, and gave 'em all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he cou'd; but finding it was but two Days &s;ince the Engagement, we had &s;ome hopes of coming up with her, being we learnt from the other Ship &s;he was mightily di&s;abled as well as them&s;elves. So we crowded all the Sails we cou'd; and tho' it was in the Night, we made the be&s;t of our way.
<PB N="130" REF="344">
The Ve&s;&s;el we left, &s;aluted us with five Guns to take their Leave, which we an|&s;wer'd with three; and in a quarter of an Hour afterwards heard &s;everal Guns fir'd now and then, as if &s;ome Ve&s;&s;el was in di&s;tre&s;s, and in an Hour more di&s;cover'd a Light, which we made directly towards, and coming up with it, found it to be the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el that had engag'd with the other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship two Days before; the Light that they made was only a large Lanthorn fix'd on their main Top-Ma&s;t Head, that we might the &s;ooner perceive 'em. We immediately hail'd 'em, and commanded 'em to &s;urrender: They readily obey'd, and beg'd our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which they had great need of; for the Water gaining upon 'em every Moment in an Hours time, the Ship &s;unk, but we had pre&s;erv'd all the Men, being in num|ber 23, having lo&s;t in the Engagement with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship 27, and receiv'd &s;everal Shot between Wind and Water, which they did not perceive till they di&s;co|ver'd two Foot Water in the Hold, and found no hopes of being &s;av'd from the merci|le&s;s Enemy the Sea, if we had not fortu|nately

for them came timely to their A&s;|&s;i&s;tance. But to allay their Joy for their Deliverance from Death, they were made Pri&s;oners, and being Pyrates (as we &s;up|pos'd,) for there was no War declar'd be|tween the two Nations; therefore they might very probably think they were to be puni&s;h'd with Death when they came on &s;hore.</P>
<P>The Ship &s;unk &s;o fa&s;t, that we cou'd &s;ave nothing but the Men, which took us up about four Hours, and then we pur&s;u'd our Cour&s;e, and about four in the Evening made the I&s;land <HI>Barbados,</HI> where we &s;et our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners on &s;hore. Captain <HI>Walton</HI> gave the Governor an Account of what had happen'd, and left it to his di&s;|cretion to do with 'em as he thought fit.</P>
<P>On <HI>June</HI> the Twenty-third we &s;et Sail for <HI>Dominio,</HI> where we arriv'd without any Accident. Here I went on &s;hore along with &s;everal of our Men to get Wood and Water for our Ship. The Natives &s;eem'd very civil, and came on Board us in their <HI>Canoes.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> are mo&s;t of 'em tall, lu&s;ty Men, well featur'd and well limb'd,

but poor Brains, for an ordinary Gla&s;s of Rum will make 'em drunk: They mightily like this Liquor, and will call for it as &s;oon as ever they come on Board you: They wear no Cloaths, but a little Skirt about their Wa&s;te; but mo&s;t of 'em have Pieces of Bra&s;s in the form of a Three|quarter Moon in their No&s;e and Ears. I gave one of the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> a pair of Breeches, and he made an E&s;&s;ay to put 'em on in this manner. He fir&s;t put his two Arms into the Thighs of the Breeches, and de&s;ir'd one of his Companions to but|ton the Wa&s;teband about his Neck; but when we &s;how'd him the right way, and he had put 'em on, he walk'd as if he had formerly worn Irons, and was &s;o un|ea&s;y with 'em that he pull'd 'em off, and made Signs to have &s;ome Linnen in exchange: In Return I gave him a long Cravat, and ty'd it properly about his Neck: But to &s;ee how the Fellow &s;trutted, one wou'd have taken him for one of the Captains of the Train'd-Bands, ready to march.</P>
<P>I rambled with the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> &s;everal Miles up in the Country, and &s;aw their
<PB N="133" REF="347">
Hutts, that were dig'd about three Foot deep in the Earth, and then rais'd about &s;ix Foot high above the Surface, and co|ver'd with Barks of Trees, and &s;ometimes divided into Apartments by a couple of long Poles, and Fathers, Sons and Daugh|ters, lie promi&s;cuou&s;ly together.</P>
<P>The Day before we &s;ail'd, (after we had provided our &s;elves with Wood and Water) I went up to the <HI>Indian</HI> Hutts to exchange a trifle or two for one of their Bows and Arrows; and returning towards the Ship, by my &s;elf, lo&s;t my way; and tho' I directed my Cour&s;e (as I thought right) I came to that part of the Shore where was no Ship to be found; but en|deavouring to go more We&s;t along the <HI>Strand,</HI> my Way was intercepted by &s;eve|ral high pointed Rocks, which I made &s;e|veral fruitle&s;s E&s;&s;ays to pa&s;s. I then en|deavour'd to make a Compa&s;s within Land to get by the Rocks; which I did, but cou'd not find the Bay where the Ship rod. I was now in a deep perplexity, and tho' very much tyr'd, yet re&s;olv'd to look for the Track that wou'd
<PB N="134" REF="348">
carry me back to &s;ome of the Huts, where I might get an <HI>Indian</HI> to direct me; but there were &s;o many various ones, that I knew not which to chu&s;e. At la&s;t I pitch'd upon one that brought me to &s;everal of 'em, but not tho&s;e from whence I came. I &s;earch'd 'em, but cou'd find no <HI>Indians</HI> in 'em. I from thence walk'd a little far|ther, but was &s;urpriz'd with a Sight that &s;hock'd me with Horror. Near the Skirt of a thick Wood I found one of our Men kill'd, with an Arrow in his Throat; and by the Po&s;ture he lay in, I found it was done when he was ea&s;ing Nature. The Object &s;o overcame me, that I thought not my own unhappy Condition, till I was awak'd from my Stupidity by a Noi&s;e and Gabbling I heard in the Wood on my Right. This put me into a terrible Fright, which made me run as far from the Noi&s;e as I cou'd; for I made no doubt, that if they caught me, I &s;hou'd run the &s;ame Fate with the poor, unfortunate Fellow, who perhaps might lo&s;e his Life by his &s;eeking me. When I had got a con&s;ide|rable Di&s;tance, I enter'd the Wood, and
<PB N="135" REF="349">
ventur'd to look out, where I cou'd per|ceive (tho' it was almo&s;t dark) what they were doing.</P>
<P>They cut off the poor Fellow's Head, and tore out his Bowels in a mo&s;t inhu|mane Manner. Let any one judge what my Condition mu&s;t be; I'm &s;ure my Thoughts were &s;o confus'd, that I might ju&s;tly &s;ay I never thought at all. I ob|&s;erv'd, when they had done, they carry'd him between Eight of 'em upon four Staves, and went towards their Tents. When they were gone, and I had lea&s;ure for Reflection, every Thought was a Dag|ger to me; but yet when my Sen&s;es were compos'd, I put my Tru&s;t in God that he wou'd deliver me from this Danger, as well as &s;everal other imminent ones, which through his Mercy I had overcome.</P>
<P>I crept farther into the Wood to re&s;t my Limbs, but my Thoughts kept me waking all Night. When Day approach'd I went &s;till farther into the Wood, not only to avoid tho&s;e Barbarous <HI>Indians,</HI> but to &s;ee if, when on the other &s;ide, I cou'd find &s;ome Path that wou'd. lead me to the Bay where our Ship rode; but
<PB N="136" REF="350">
before I cou'd get out of it I heard a <HI>Can|non</HI> di&s;charg'd, that both rejoyc'd and griev'd me; it joy'd me to know that the Ship cou'd not be far off, and griev'd me to think that it was certainly the Signal for the Boat to come on Board, and per|haps they might be that Moment under Sail. I ran with all the ha&s;te I cou'd&punc; but with a Mind mix'd with Hope and Fear. I got out of the Wood at la&s;t, and directed my Cour&s;e to that Part as I thought the Noi&s;e of the Gun came from, but cou'd find no Path; yet at la&s;t I got to the Top of a Rock from whence I cou'd behold the Sea, and the great Grief to &s;ee our Ship under Sail not half a League from the Shore. I immediately pull'd off my Shirt, and hung it to a Stick I had broke to &s;upport me in my Walk|ing; but my Signal did not do me any good, for they &s;aw nothing of it. My De&s;pair began to be predominant o're my Rea&s;on, and I had often re&s;olv'd to throw my &s;elf down from the Rock to end my Mi&s;ery; but &s;till my Con&s;cience wou'd give me a &s;ecret Check; and at la&s;t I re|&s;olv'd with my &s;elf to &s;ubmit to whatever
<PB N="137" REF="351">
&s;hou'd befall me, with a thorough Re&s;igna|tion to the Will of Heav'n. As &s;oon as the Ship was out of &s;ight, I went down from the Rock (not having power to &s;tir before) and endeavour'd to find &s;ome Food, but was prevented by a hideous Noi&s;e I heard, which drove me to &s;helter in the Wood again; but the farther I went, the plainer I heard the Noi&s;e, &s;o that I knew not what to do; for at la&s;t it increas'd on every &s;ide: So that coming to a thick parcel of Shrubs, I laid my &s;elf down, and couch'd &s;o clo&s;e, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for 'em to &s;ee me, unle&s;s they came into the very middle of it. I had thrown my Bow and Arrows away, as being of no u&s;e to me; but I had my Sword, which, however, I did not de&s;ign to u&s;e. The Noi&s;e came &s;o nigh me, that I cou'd hear the Tread of their Feet, and the Boughs ru&s;tle about me; but at la&s;t they went in&s;en&s;ibly away, &s;o that I heard no more of 'em for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>When I found all was &s;till, I began to get up and look about me, where I &s;aw 'em in the Plain engag'd with &s;everal o|ther <HI>Indians,</HI> whom I thought I knew,
<PB N="138" REF="352">
tho' at a good Di&s;tance. I &s;aw &s;everal of 'em fall upon the Ground. At la&s;t tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> that went hollowing through the Wood &s;eem'd to me to have the wor&s;t of it, and were drove by the other Party quite back again; but did not pur&s;ue 'em any farther, only let fly their Arrows at 'em; and one of 'em came among the Shrubs where I lay, which &s;tartled me, for I was afraid they wou'd come to look for their Arrows, and &s;o find me. After the hurly|burly was over, I re&s;olv'd to go out of the Wood, and follow tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> that were Vanqui&s;hers, with this hope, That they might be of a milder Nature, and not &s;o barbarous as the others who run through the Wood, who to my thinking had more &s;tern Looks than tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> I had &s;een upon that part of the I&s;land where we us'd to Land to get Wood and Water. So as I &s;aid, I got up, and di|rected my Cour&s;e out of the Wood after the <HI>Indians,</HI> but &s;oon di&s;cover'd two <HI>In|dian</HI> Men, and four Women coming to|wards me, (which I &s;uppo&s;e had hid them|&s;elves during the late Conflict:) It was to no purpo&s;e for me to fly, for they had got
<PB N="139" REF="353">
&s;ight of me; or if I had, they wou'd have &s;oon &s;ent one of their winged Me&s;&s;engers after me; &s;o I cho&s;e boldly to meet 'em. When we were come within forty Paces one of another, one of the <HI>Indians</HI> was going to &s;hoot at me, but was with-held by one of the Women: As &s;oon as ever I came clo&s;e to 'em, they look'd upon me with &s;trange Ge&s;tures, and di&s;torted Coun|tenances; I put my Hand to my Head and Brea&s;t, which is the Token of Sub|mi&s;&s;ion with the <HI>Indians;</HI> and they let me know by Signs that I mu&s;t go with them, which I did not deny; for if I had, I knew I &s;hou'd be forc'd; &s;o I went willingly enough. When we had got through the Wood, one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Men wou'd have my Coat and Wa&s;tecoat of, which I dur&s;t not refu&s;e: The Coat he put upon his Companion, and the Wa&s;tecoat on him&s;elf, and &s;trutted &s;trangely. I gave my Handkerchief and Neckcloth to the Wo|man that hinder'd the <HI>Indian</HI> from &s;hoot|ing at me, who receiv'd it with a great deal of Joy, and &s;eem'd mightily pleas'd with me. When we arriv'd at their Hutts, there came out at lea&s;t a Hundred
<PB N="140" REF="354">
Frightful-looking <HI>Indians,</HI> who came a|bout me, and had a great deal of Talk with tho&s;e that brought me with 'em; but the two <HI>Indians</HI> were forc'd to part with their Cloaths they had taken from me, to two of the olde&s;t <HI>Indians,</HI> who im|mediately put 'em on, and &s;eem'd mighty proud of them&s;elves. They gave me &s;ome Rice, and another &s;ort of Victuals boyl'd; but what it was compos'd of, I cou'd ne|ver learn, neither did I eat any of the &s;ame all the while I was among 'em. When Night came, I was &s;ent into a Hutt by my &s;elf, and the Door &s;hut upon me, I had a piece of Mat to lie on, but no|thing to cover me. Now I had lea&s;ure to reflect upon my Misfortunes, which I cou'd not do before, by rea&s;on of the Fears I was in. I thought my Condition was now wor&s;e than ever it was, for I re|ally believ'd they de&s;ign'd to make a Sa|crifice of me, for I thought to my &s;elf they were Cannibals, or Men-Eaters. I pa&s;s'd the Night with a thou&s;and Anxie|ties and Inquietudes; but neverthele&s;s my Sen&s;es were &s;o tyr'd, that I &s;lept whether I wou'd or no; and in the Morning was
<PB N="141" REF="355">
awak'd by four of the Elde&s;t <HI>Indians</HI> that came to vi&s;it me, who made Signs to me to follow 'em, which I did without any he&s;itation; when I was out in the mid&s;t of the plain Place before the Doors of their Hutts, they brought before me &s;eve|ral of their Women, and gave me to know by Signs that I &s;hou'd take her to be my Mate, or Bedfellow, or &s;uffer Death. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was mightily &s;hock'd, but not giving my &s;elf much time to weigh, or think of the Matter, I pitch'd upon her that I had given my Neckcloth and Hand|kerchief too, and immediately all the re&s;t were di&s;mi&s;s'd; and my Bride and I (for it was even &s;o) were conducted to a Hutt, where there was &s;everal old <HI>Indians</HI> wait|ing for me to compleat the Ceremony. When my Bride and I came before 'em, we were order'd to &s;it down, then both our Feet were wa&s;h'd with Water: After that they brought us a piece of their <HI>Indian</HI> Cake, or Bread, on which I was order'd to break off a piece, and give to my Bride. She then came and laid her Head on my Brea&s;t; and then, kneeling, put my Right Foot upon her Neck; when that was done,
<PB N="142" REF="356">
&s;he ro&s;e and went out, but immediately re|turn'd, and brought me &s;ome Fle&s;h broil'd on the Coals, with which &s;he tore into Mor&s;els, and put in my Mouth, and &s;tood before me all the while I eat. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was &s;o hungry, that I had a very good Appetite to my Victuals, being I had not eat any Fle&s;h for four Days: But I had no great Stomach to my Bride, although a young well-featur'd Woman, yet her Complexion did not like me. When I had done Eating, my Bride and I were put into a Hutt, and &s;hut clo&s;e without any Light; but the old Proverb, <HI>Joan's as good as my Lady in the Dark,</HI> had like to have prov'd no Proverb to me. In the Morning we were wak'd with a rude Noi&s;e round our Tent, which &s;tartled me at fir&s;t; but I found afterwards it was a &s;ort of an <HI>Epithalamium.</HI> When they had made their frightful Noi&s;e for &s;ometime, they enter'd promi&s;cuou&s;ly Men and Wo|men. The Men came and took hold of me, and the Women of my new Spou&s;e, led us out with Shouts, unplea&s;ing Noi&s;es, and antick Ge&s;tures: They continu'd it till we came to a River, and then we
<PB N="143" REF="357">
parted; the Men with me, and the Women with my Wife. They put me into the River, and wa&s;h'd me all over, and I &s;up|po&s;e the Women did as much by my Tawny Rib. After they had given notice by their Shouts, that they had made an End of &s;cowring me, they put on my Shirt and Drawers again, and led me to the Bank where my Spou&s;e waited for me with her She-attendance, and we return'd with the &s;ame Noi&s;e as we came out. When we came to the Hutts, the old <HI>In|dians</HI> met us; the Old Men took me, and the Old Women my Wife, and gave us an Entertainment &s;eperably, which la&s;ted two Hours, according to my Computation; when they had made an End, they fetch'd us out of our different Tents, and &s;eated us on a Bank, and then danc'd, and play'd &s;uch mad, rude, monkey Gambols, that put me in mind of the mad Fea&s;ts of the <HI>Bachii</HI> in <HI>Virgil,</HI> for they wou'd tear their Faces with their Nails, and &s;cratch one another &s;o violently, that one wou'd have thought they had been &s;o many <HI>Bethle|mites,</HI> and yet all in Mirth; for they wou'd laugh &s;uch Hor&s;e-laughs when ever
<PB N="144" REF="358">
any one of 'em was hurt, that quite &s;tun'd me. When this &s;port was over, the young <HI>Indians</HI> of both Sexes took my Bride and I into one of their Hutts, and gave us an Entertainment of Fi&s;h broil'd upon the Coals, and a plea&s;ant Liquor in a <HI>Cala|ba&s;h,</HI> that was exceeding &s;trong, which &s;oon got into mo&s;t of their Noddles; and as fa&s;t as they grew a little Tip&s;ie, they reel'd out one by one, and laid them&s;elves before the Door of the Hutt, and went to &s;leep. My good Wife, among the re&s;t, got her Do&s;e too; but was &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly loving withall, that I cou'd not tell well what to do with her. When Night came, we retir'd to our Re&s;t as before, and were wak'd next Morning by another kind of Noi&s;e that was made, with rude knocking at our Door, or rather Basket, for it was nothing el&s;e, and five or &s;ix of the old <HI>Indi|ans</HI> came in with Hatchets, and other In&s;tru|ments, to enable us to get Food for our &s;elves, as I under&s;tood. My Wife took me out by the Arm, and carry'd me into the Wood with our Bows and Arrows, and by her Signs gave me to under&s;tand that &s;he wou'd bring me where I &s;hou'd kill
<PB N="145" REF="359">
&s;ome Creature. At la&s;t we came to the Foot of a Hill, where we a&s;cended with &s;ome difficulty; but when we had gain'd the Summit, we di&s;cover'd va&s;t Numbers, or Herds of Goats. My Spou&s;e &s;hot, and kill'd one the fir&s;t time; but I was &s;uch a Bungler at it, that I cou'd never do any execution. But my Spou&s;e was very dex|terous, as all the <HI>Indians</HI> are in the I&s;land of <HI>Dominico.</HI> My Wife &s;eem'd to have a great Love for me, and wou'd always make much of me, her Way. When we had skin'd our Goat, we took out our Implements, and made a Fire to broil &s;ome of it. When it was ready, I gave my Creator thanks for providing for us poor in&s;ignificant Mortals; and looking towards Heav'n, the Re&s;idence of him that form'd us all. My Wife fix'd her Eyes upon me, and then look'd upwards too, with a kind of Concern. After we had done, I return'd thanks again in the &s;ame manner as before, and my Wife did the &s;ame; that is, &s;he &s;tar'd upwards a|gain as if &s;he had a mind to &s;ee &s;ome|thing as &s;he thought I look'd at: And when &s;he found &s;he cou'd not &s;ee any thing,
<PB N="146" REF="360">
&s;he came to me, and put her Arm ten|derly about my Neck, and with a &s;ort of a begging Tone, &s;eem'd to ask me by Signs and Words, which I cou'd not under&s;tand, what I meant by looking upwards. I re|ally griev'd to know that I cou'd not make her under&s;tand, for I cou'd not learn any of their Speech, but here and there a common Word; neither did I ever perceive they had any manner of Wor&s;hip to any thing; otherwi&s;e if I wou'd have made her comprehend what I meant, I might have found it no hard Matter to have converted her from their abominable Heatheni&s;m; for &s;he was of a mighty mild Nature, very Loving and Courteous, and nothing like the re&s;t of the Savage Crew, who were prone to all manner of Wickedne&s;s. Her Voice too, differ'd from theirs, for mo&s;t of the <HI>Indians</HI> pro|nounc'd their Words in their Throat, as indeed you cou'd not well &s;peak 'em with|out a Gutteral Sound; yet &s;he, whatever was the meaning on't, &s;poke her Words a different Way from the re&s;t, and had a plea&s;ing Manner. I really began to love her, and only wi&s;h'd &s;he had been my
<PB N="147" REF="361">
Wife in the u&s;ual Forms: She cou'd pro|nounce any Word in Engli&s;h that I wou'd &s;ay to her, but I cou'd never get her to repeat whole Sentences; and all &s;he did was like a Parrot. After we had done our hunting-work, I was for going over the Hill to view the Country, and walk'd up and down a good way; but I ob&s;erv'd my Wife was very unea&s;y, but e&s;pecially when I got to the Brow of the Hill. On the other &s;ide (which was about half a League over) I made an E&s;&s;ay to go down; &s;he laid hold of my Arms, and pull'd me back with all her force, and with many &s;upplicating Actions &s;eem'd to beg of me not to go; and when &s;he found I was offering at it again, &s;he &s;creem'd out &s;o di&s;mally, that it frighted me from making any more attempts. I endeavour'd to know what &s;he meant, but cou'd gather nothing from her Words and Actions that cou'd let me into any thing: But &s;he wou'd often handle her Bow and Arrows, and with menacing Actions let me know there was &s;ome Danger. As we went homeward this odd Accident ran very much in my Head, and I was mighty
<PB N="148" REF="362">
de&s;irous to find out the meaning of it; and every time I went to hunt there with my Wife, I wanted &s;adly to get down the Hill on the other &s;ide. This Hill was of a va&s;t Length, and extended from Ea&s;t to South-We&s;t, almo&s;t a-cro&s;s the I&s;land. I did not know how to contrive it, but af|ter hunting, I made believe I was very much tyr'd, and laid my &s;elf down in order to &s;leep; and my Wife with her u&s;ual good humour, accompany'd me, and in a very little time I found &s;he was in a &s;ound Sleep. I immediately ro&s;e, and &s;tole away &s;oftly upon my intended Journey. I got away from my Wife without her awaking, and came to the Brow of the Hill, which I &s;urvey'd, and found no difficulty in the de&s;cending. When I had got to the Pot|tom of the Hill, I was mightily pleas'd with the Evenne&s;s of the Ground, and the Pro&s;pect round me, which I cou'd compare to nothing but the Vale of <HI>E&s;ham</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> bating the Hou&s;es and Towns in't. I had walk'd up and down the Vale for near an Hour, and was preparing to go back the &s;ame way I came. When looking back to take my la&s;t Survey, I
<PB N="149" REF="363">
&s;aw a Smoak at a Di&s;tance, and it ran in my Mind it was the very place that our Men us'd to go to, from on Board, to truck with the Inhabitants. The Thought took up &s;ome of my Time; and I believe, if it had not been for a tender Regard for my Wife, I had certainly directed my Cour&s;e for that Smoak I &s;aw there. But I mu&s;t confe&s;s I cou'd not think of leaving her behind me, but Curio&s;ity put it into my Head to go a little nearer that Smoak I had di&s;cover'd: But ju&s;t as I was mo|ving that way, I heard a dreadful Scream|ing behind me; and turning about, I &s;aw my Wife upon the Brow of the Hill, ma|king the mo&s;t pitiful Lamentation imagi|nable. The tender Regard I now began to have for my Wife, made me make all the ha&s;te I cou'd to her Relief, as thinking &s;ome Mi&s;chance might have befell her. When I came to the Bottom of the Hill, I &s;aw &s;everal of the <HI>Indians</HI> of our Neigh|bourhood waiting for me above, and &s;ome were coming down. As &s;oon as I had got to the Top of the Hill, I was imme|diately &s;eiz'd by the <HI>Indians</HI> above, and drag'd along as if I had been the greate&s;t
<PB N="150" REF="364">
Criminal imaginable, and my poor Wife hanging upon my Arm all drown'd in Tears. I cou'd not imagin what was the Matter, and what cou'd be the Rea&s;on of their u&s;ing me in that manner. I found it mu&s;t be &s;omething extraordinary by the Grief of my Wife, who&s;e Sorrow increas'd the farther I went towards our Hutts; but e're we cou'd get there, it rain'd and thun|der'd &s;o violently, that we were well wa&s;h'd before we came to our Journey's End, when we were within ken of our Hutts; the whole Tribe came near us, &s;ome skipping and dancing, as mightily rejoyc'd; others with the Face of Con|cern, and hanging their Heads in &s;ign of Sorrow, and mightily lamented over my Wife. After the old <HI>Indians</HI> had con&s;ult|ed &s;ome time, they ty'd me to a wither'd Tree that &s;tood at the Mouth of the Hutts; then I began to under&s;tand what they meant, for I cou'd perceive they were bringing Boughs of green Wood, in order to burn me. This Sight made my Courage fail me, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s my De&s;pair and Horror. I found now that the la&s;t Day of my Life was
<PB N="115" REF="365">
come, (for it was impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee any thing to the contrary.) My la&s;t Recour&s;e was to the Maker and Giver of all good Things, for I had try'd all other Means in vain; as al&s;o had my poor Wife, who&s;e Rage and De&s;pair overcame her; and &s;he was carry'd away by the Women in the utmo&s;t Agony. After my Wife was gone, they &s;et fire to the Wood which enclos'd me; which being green and wet with the late Rain, was a great while in Burning; all the while it was kindling, &s;ome of the <HI>Indians</HI> jump'd round me, and danc'd af|ter their barbarous manner, while others &s;tood ready with their Bows and Arrows to &s;hoot at me (as I &s;uppos'd) if the Fire &s;hou'd burn the Bands that ty'd me, and I &s;hou'd offer to run away. The Wood being green (as I &s;aid before) was very &s;tubborn in kindling, which made the Ap|prehen&s;ion more dreadful: I made &s;everal E&s;&s;ays to break the Bands that held me, but all my Efforts were but in vain; and I ob&s;erv'd every Time I made my fruit|le&s;s Endeavours, the barbarous Crew &s;houted and laugh'd for joy. The Fire encrea&s;ing, I pray'd to Almighty God to
<PB N="152" REF="366">
give me Strength to bear the horrid Pain I was going to &s;uffer; and, if it was po&s;&s;i|ble, to go out of the World with the Pa|tience and Fortitude of a good Chri&s;tian, who was only going to change this trou|ble&s;ome Life for a better. I compar'd my &s;elf to a wounded Per&s;on, that mu&s;t bear probing of his Hurts, in order to cure 'em. I now had given my &s;elf up entirely to my Thoughts of the other World; and this &s;eem'd to me like aban|doning a barren I&s;land, in order to go to one where was plenty of every thing. But before the Fire reach'd me, there fell &s;uch a prodigious Showre of Rain, mix'd with Thunder and Lightning, that ex|tingui&s;h'd the Fire. The Storm la&s;ted for &s;everal Hours with the utmo&s;t Violence, and I remain'd &s;till ty'd to the Tree. When the Storm was over, they began to renew their Fire, and brought the Wood nearer than before, it being at fir&s;t half a Yard from my Body all round; but now they pil'd it clo&s;e to me, that the Fire might the &s;ooner be my Executioner, which I wi&s;h'd for, as knowing it wou'd put me to a &s;peedier Death. But before
<PB N="153" REF="367">
they had well plac'd the Wood, they heard Shouts and Noi&s;es in the adjacent Woods; upon which the <HI>Indians</HI> imme|diately ran away from me, and took to their Arms in an In&s;tant, old and young. The Noi&s;e came nearer, and nearer &s;till, till at la&s;t I cou'd perceive &s;everal <HI>Indians</HI> bolt out of the Wood, who were met by our <HI>Indians,</HI> and a bloody Fight en&s;u'd. The Enemy <HI>Indians</HI> &s;eem'd to have the be&s;t on't, by rea&s;on of &s;ome Fire-Arms that they had, with which they made &s;trange havock with our <HI>Indians;</HI> the Battle conti|nu'd for &s;ome Hours with a great deal of Heat, and many of our <HI>Indians</HI> fell. At la&s;t the Enemy <HI>Indians</HI> drove ours, even be|yond the Hutts, and I cou'd only hear the Noi&s;e they made, being I was &s;till fa&s;tned to the Tree. The Fight continu'd out of &s;ight about half an Hour, when my Wife came running with all the Tran&s;ports of Joy imaginable; and after having put her Head under my Feet, &s;he unty'd me, and fell upon me with all the Signs of a &s;incere Love. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was mightily re|joyc'd to &s;ee my &s;elf at Liberty, and let what wou'd happen, my Condition cou'd
<PB N="154" REF="368">
not be wor&s;e than it was &s;ome Hours ago. I cou'd not forbear expre&s;&s;ing my Love to my Wife by Ki&s;&s;es and Embraces. We went to our Hutt, and I took my Sword that had been laid up from my fir&s;t being among&s;t 'em. I was going out of my Tent in order to go with my Wife to &s;ome o|ther part of the I&s;land, that was not known to the&s;e <HI>Indians:</HI> But ju&s;t as we came among the Tents, three <HI>Indians</HI> met us that had run way from the Fight (as I conjectur'd:) As &s;oon as they &s;aw me and my Wife, they came up with a great deal of ill Nature in their Countenances; and after &s;ome Talk with my Wife, one of 'em with his wooden Sword, went to make a Blow at me; but my Wife inter|po&s;ing, receiv'd the Blow upon her Head, which &s;truck her to the Ground, bloody and &s;en&s;ele&s;s. My Rage ro&s;e &s;o high up|on this, that I cou'd not contain my &s;elf; but I drew my Sword, and thru&s;t it up to the Hilt in the Wretches Body; the other two &s;eeing their Companion's Death, ran upon me with the Rage of Lyons; but I &s;lipping on one &s;ide, avoided the Strokes intended me: They turn'd immediately
<PB N="155" REF="369">
upon me, and let drive at me &s;everal Blows, which had the good Fortune not to hit me; but I run one of 'em into the Throat with my Sword; upon which he &s;et up &s;uch a Cry that frightned me, and ran away, and was immediately follow'd by the other. I then ran to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of my Wife, who lay almo&s;t &s;trangled in her own Blood. I rais'd her from the Earth, and &s;eated her under the Tree where I was ty'd, and brought her to her &s;elf a little; but I found her Skull was crack'd with the Blow the <HI>Indian</HI> gave her, and to my great Grief perceiv'd &s;he was ju&s;t expiring. But the Sorrow and Tender|ne&s;s to part with me, (as I judg'd by her Actions) &s;truck me to the Soul. She laid one Arm about my Wa&s;te, and her Head in my Lap, but with &s;uch piteous Looks with her Eyes that almo&s;t di&s;tracted me. She made Signs to me to look upward (as I fancy'd) to pray for her, tho' I cou'd not tell for certain what &s;he meant; but &s;he pronounc'd &s;everal Words with Ear|ne&s;tne&s;s and Pa&s;&s;ion; and I really fancy'd, if we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">u'd have under&s;tood one another, I &s;hou'd have found &s;he wou'd have had

They were mightily &s;urpriz'd to find me, for many of the Enemy <HI>Indians</HI> knew me; and when I came to examine their Faces, I remember'd they were the <HI>Indians</HI> that inhabited about the Bay where our Ship lay. One or two of 'em cou'd &s;peak a little Engli&s;h, that they learn'd by con|ver&s;ing with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that u&s;ually An|chor'd in the Bay.

I was really as much concern'd, as if I had marry'd one of my own Complexion and Country; for I had great Hopes, if ever I cou'd have made my E&s;cape with her, and cou'd but have taught her Engli&s;h, to have made her a good Chri&s;tian. With the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of my now friendly <HI>Indians</HI> I laid her in the Earth: They told me &s;he was Daughter to one of the Chief of their Enemy-Tribe.

The&s;e friendly <HI>Indians</HI> were often plagu'd with their &s;udden ru&s;hing upon them, and de&s;troying many of them, till at la&s;t they took up a re&s;olution to A&s;&s;ault them, and if po&s;&s;ible to extirpate the whole Race; and they had often made Inroads upon 'em, which le&s;&s;en'd their Number till this la&s;t ended 'em, as I &s;aid before. The Women and Female Children dwelt con|tentedly among 'em, being they had no where to go. I began to live comfortably among the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> and us'd to partake of their Diver&s;ion and Labour; as, Hunt|ing and Fi&s;hing, &amp;c. The&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> were &s;o expert in Shooting with their Bows and Arrows, that I have &s;een 'em hit the Mark Three Hundred Yards, within the compa&s;s of a half Crown.</P>
<P>This I&s;land of <HI>Dominico</HI> took its Name from its being di&s;cover'd on a <HI>Sunday.</HI> It is computed to be in length about thirty Leagues, and about twenty-eight in
<PB N="159" REF="373">
breadth. It is very mountainous, e&s;peci|ally to the North-Ea&s;t. I have heard there are &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Settlements upon the I&s;land; but I enquir'd of the above-menti|on'd <HI>Indian,</HI> who a&s;&s;ur'd me there was not any Inhabitants but Natives, and of tho&s;e not above a Hundred Families, who were mo&s;tly &s;eated near that Part that compos'd the Harbour. Says the <HI>Indian</HI> that I us'd to talk with, there be &s;ome indeed a great way off in <HI>de I&s;land,</HI> dat are our Fathers and Mothers; and &s;ome of our Wives dat when de die, we throw into de Sea, and de &s;wim to dat place; and when we die, we &s;wim dere too. By this we might perceive they had &s;ome Notion of the Immortality of the Soul. I did my Endeavour to make him &s;en&s;ible of the Joys of Heaven, and Pains of Hell, but to no purpo&s;e. I told him of a &s;u|perior Being that commanded all things below, and that Righteous People dwelt with him after this Life. He ask'd where my God live? His Throne is in Heaven, an&s;wer'd I, pointing upward, where He &s;its to Judge the Quick and Dead. He
<PB N="160" REF="374">
live up dare, high; how you get up high, no &s;teps reach dare. It is our Immortal Part, added I, that a&s;cends, our Soul, which is cloath'd with the Grace of our Divine Creator, and enjoys an Eternity of Ble&s;&s;ings. You be de <HI>White Man,</HI> you have Soul; we be no <HI>White,</HI> we have no Soul; when we die, we fling in Water, big Fi&s;h come carry us to an oder place, den we live dare and die agen, and Fi&s;h bring us upon back to an oder place. How are you a&s;&s;ur'd of this (&s;ays I?) Have you ever &s;een any that have been tran&s;ported in the manner you tell me of? No (an&s;wer'd he) but me &s;ure it be &s;o. But when we were carry'd by Fi&s;h to dat oder place, we eat de Leaf of Tree, dat we can no remember what we do in toter place, dat we be bring from. All the Argu|ments I cou'd u&s;e was of no Effect; for Hea|theni&s;m was &s;o rooted in him, and all the other <HI>Indians,</HI> that it will be the greate&s;t Difficulty imaginable to bring 'em to em|brace Chri&s;tianity. Their Under&s;tand|ings are &s;o infirm, that without a Miracle there will be no curing 'em. The <HI>Indi|ans</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="375">
wou'd have had me marry'd into one of their Tribe; and I, fearful to deny 'em, brought my &s;elf off by telling no <HI>White</HI> cou'd marry under twelve Moons after their Wive's Death; with which they &s;eem'd &s;atisfy'd, but made me Pro|mi&s;e when that time was expir'd to change my Condition of Widower to that of Marry'd Man. I might have been ac|commodated with a She-Companion if I had found any Inclination, but I evaded it as well as I could.</P>
<P>The Soil of the I&s;land is very fruitful, and there's plenty of every thing.</P>
<P>I could not perceive that the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> wor&s;hip'd any thing, except the Moon: Which when at full, they would all ga|ther together; and looking upward, &s;tand gazing a con&s;iderable time, and then with one Con&s;ent pronounce a word which &s;ounded like <HI>Hiu!</HI> This word they gene|rally repeated three times. When they had done <HI>Stargazing,</HI> they would fall to Jumping and Capering like &s;o many mad things. When that was over, they would retire to their &s;everal Hutts, and not &s;tir out till Morning upon any account.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="376">
I ask'd <HI>Will</HI> (for that was the Name of him that could &s;peak Engli&s;h, who was mighty proud to be call'd &s;o) what Cere|mony was it they perform'd after they were retir'd into their Hutts? But he an|&s;wer'd, <HI>Me no tell dat, Wife make much Noi&s;e, &s;he no care for dat; when you have new Wife, you know what we do, but me no tell till den.</HI> What gave me a Curio&s;ity to know, was, that <HI>Will</HI> told me that af|ter the Ceremony was over, I mu&s;t not offer to come out of my Hutt, nor come a nigh any of theirs; for if I did, they would kill me. The Hutt that was built for me, was order'd in another manner than their own, with a high Door made of Wicket; there's being &s;o low, that an ordinary &s;iz'd Man mu&s;t have &s;toop'd to go in or out.</P>
<P>I us'd to go fi&s;h in their <HI>Canoes</HI> with 'em, where they would catch good &s;tore; and let it be what it would, the Cargo was divided among the whole Tribe, only he that caught 'em cho&s;e fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I told <HI>Will,</HI> that as &s;oon as ever a Ship arriv'd there, I did de&s;ign to imbark in her in order to pur&s;ue my Voyage: But he
<PB N="163" REF="377">
told me I mu&s;t take care not to let any other of the <HI>Indians</HI> know it, for they would never &s;uffer any one to go from 'em, after they had been once &s;ettled a|mong 'em. How do you know that, &s;ays I? Have you had any Talk with 'em con|cerning me? He told me he had not, but it was their way: For he gave me to un|der&s;tand, that about &s;ix Years ago there was four Men left on &s;hore upon their I&s;land, by rea&s;on of their Ve&s;&s;el driving out to Sea by a Hurricano; and the&s;e four Men &s;ettled among 'em, and marry'd <HI>Indian</HI> Wives, and had Children by 'em. But at any time when a Ship came into the Bay, they were hurry'd a great way up in the Country, and detain'd there till the Ships were gone, and then liv'd with 'em as before. But a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el put|ting in there by Night, the Engli&s;h-Men &s;py'd it before any of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and were got to the Shore &s;ide, conver&s;ing with the Crew of the Ve&s;&s;el before the <HI>Indians</HI> found 'em out. But when they &s;aw 'em talking together, they were mightily enrag'd. The four Men went on Board the Ve&s;&s;el to make merry with
<PB N="164" REF="378">
their Countrymen, and afterwards came on &s;hore again, and made it no Secret, that they de&s;ign'd to go on Board that Ve&s;&s;el in order to go to their own Coun|try. The <HI>Indians</HI> took no notice for the pre&s;ent: But the Day they de&s;ign'd to imbark, they &s;et upon the Ve&s;&s;el with their <HI>Canoes,</HI> and kill'd every Per&s;on on Board it. When they had done that, they took as many things out of her as they had occa&s;ion for, and &s;et her a-drift. He told me that the four <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> were the fir&s;t that taught 'em to u&s;e Fire-Arms, and in the Ship they took, they had &s;eve|ral Muskets and Quantities of Powder and Shot. But carrying the Powder to their Hutts, a Boy met 'em &s;moaking in a Cane, they call a Smoaking Cane, and by &s;ome Accident the Fire caught hold of the Powder, and blew it up, with the Death of Eight <HI>Indians,</HI> and wounding &s;everal others. After they had brought every thing up to their Hutts, they took the Wives of the four Sailors (the <HI>Indians</HI> with their Children) and &s;hot 'em to Death with Arrows. This is the Sen&s;e of the Story <HI>Indian Will</HI> told me, which
<PB N="165" REF="379">
was pretty hard to pick out too, con&s;i|dering his manner of telling it. The Re|lation made me very unea&s;y, yet put me upon thinking to make my E&s;cape the fir&s;t Opportunity. I waited a full Month before I could &s;ee any Ve&s;&s;el, but at la&s;t one came into the Harbour. I perceiv'd they came in order to get Wood by hoi&s;t|ing out their long Boat; but as I was ob|&s;erving 'em, I was &s;eiz'd by &s;everal <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> and carry'd at lea&s;t &s;ix Miles up in the Country, in order to be &s;ecur'd till the Ship &s;hould be gone. I began to de|&s;pair now of ever getting away, being it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that they would be more watchful over me for the future. Be&s;ides, I did not know but they would u&s;e me after another manner, and not let me have &s;o much Liberty as I had before. I wanted for nothing in my Confinement, and was only guarded by four <HI>Indians</HI> that went to &s;leep when I did. I once thought I might make my E&s;cape whil&s;t they &s;lept; but afterwards repented that Thought, in knowing if they &s;hould chance to wake, I was certainly a dead Man; for <HI>Indian Will</HI> told me, as I was carrying away, that
<PB N="166" REF="380">
the <HI>Indians</HI> had Orders to &s;hoot me if I offer'd to make my E&s;cape: Be&s;ides, I &s;hould have found it difficult enough to have known my way, e&s;pecially in the Dark; for they carry'd me to a place that I had never been at before. I had been here four Days, and had given over all Hopes of my Liberty, and began to call together my &s;catter'd Thoughts, that were flu&s;ter'd upon that Occa&s;ion; when, on the fourth Day, about Noon, I was agreeably &s;urpriz'd with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Voices, I began to prick up my Ears, and wi&s;h'd they might come to the place where I was. I was not long in expecting of 'em; for one of 'em &s;pying the Hutt, where I was, call'd out to the others to come along; for here's an <HI>Indian</HI>'s Hutt, &s;ays he, we'll go in it, and &s;ee what they'll give us. With that they immediately came in before two of my <HI>Indians</HI> could hide me, (the other two be|ing gone in the Morning to the Village:) As &s;oon as ever I &s;aw 'em, tho' Strangers, I could not forbear &s;howing my Tran&s;ports at the &s;ight of my Countrymen. They were mightily &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee me; and when I told 'em my Condition, they &s;aid
<PB N="167" REF="381">
they would have me along with 'em in &s;pight of their Teeth: But I told 'em that was very dangerous; for if the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould rai&s;e the Village (that lay within a Mile of the Shore) we &s;hould all lo&s;e our Lives. Some advis'd to knock 'em on the Head; but I could not agree to that, for the&s;e were <HI>Indians</HI> that never injur'd me. Two of my Countrymen had got a cou|ple of Spaw-water Flasks fill'd with Rum, upon the &s;ight of which a Thought came into my Head, that &s;eem'd the mo&s;t likely to compa&s;s my De&s;ign. I told my Coun|trymen if we could make the <HI>Indians</HI> drunk, there might be &s;ome hopes of get|ting off without either hurting them, or endangering our &s;elves. We drank to one another, and the <HI>Indians</HI> did us Rea&s;on in pledging us; for I believe out of the two Flasks they drank one and three quarters. It &s;oon began to work with them, and they got up and fell a Dancing mo&s;t mad|ly, and a while after drop'd down dead Drunk. We re&s;olv'd to tye 'em Hands and Feet, that if they awak'd, they might not follow us, and rai&s;e the whole Body of <HI>Indians</HI> upon us. With the help of
<PB N="168" REF="382">
our Garters we ty'd 'em fa&s;t enough with|out waking 'em, and made the be&s;t of our way towards the Sea-&s;ide. All the Danger we ran was in meeting with any of the other <HI>Indians,</HI> but we happily avoided 'em, and came to the place where the Boat lay. The Ship was ready to Sail, having got their Wood and Water aboard; and the&s;e eight Men were tho&s;e that had been la|bouring hard in cutting Wood, &amp;c. and &s;o were re&s;olv'd to go up the Country to view it, never having been farther than the place where they fell'd the Trees, and happily for me came to give me my Li|berty, under Providence. As we were getting into the Boat to go on Board (the Ship having made a Waft in her Ancient,) <HI>Indian Will</HI> came running down almo&s;t out of Breath, and cry'd, Get quick in Ship, they come down pre&s;ently kill all me go wid you de kill me el&s;e for tell you. We hurry'd away, and <HI>Indian Will</HI> with us, and got on Board in very good time; for before we were well under Sail, we could perceive at lea&s;t Two Hundred <HI>In|dians</HI> bringing their <HI>Canoes</HI> with 'em. We had a brisk Gale, &s;o that they could not
<PB N="169" REF="383">
well overtake us; for they never go above two Leagues from &s;hore. Neverthele&s;s they put their <HI>Canoes</HI> in the Water, and began to paddle after us. The Captain was for Firing at 'em with our great Guns, but I per&s;waded him again&s;t it, by telling him it might be wor&s;e for other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els that &s;hould come after us; and as they could not overtake us to do us any damage, it was be&s;t not to take any no|tice of 'em. When we had lo&s;t &s;ight of <HI>Dominico,</HI> I ask'd <HI>Indian Will</HI> the Rea&s;on of their endeavouring to detain all <HI>Whites</HI> in that clande&s;tine Manner; and he gave me to know, that they fear'd if the <HI>Whites</HI> &s;hould know the Smallne&s;s of their Number, that they would put 'em all to Death, and &s;eize upon the whole I&s;land. The Ship that took us up was call'd the <HI>Twins</HI> from <HI>Caroline,</HI> Captain <HI>Fuller</HI> Com|mander; &s;he came then from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and was bound for <HI>Jamaica.</HI> I took <HI>In|dian Will</HI> as my Servant, and did de&s;ign to give him &s;ome Cloaths, as &s;oon as we arriv'd at <HI>Jamaica;</HI> but for the pre&s;ent I had none for my &s;elf, and made but an odd &s;ort of a Figure. My Beard was
<PB N="170" REF="384">
pretty long, and being &s;omething incli|ning to Red, look'd but oddly: My Li|ning was all gone, &s;o that my whole Dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of a Hat, a Wa&s;tecoat, a pair of Breeches, and a pair of Shooes. The Captain was &s;o kind to lend me a Shirt, and a pair of Stockings, and I got my Beard off, and once more look'd like a Chri&s;tian. We made <HI>Jamaica</HI> without meeting with any thing material, and found the Fleet at Anchor. I went on Board the Admiral, and paid my Re&s;pects to him. which he took very kindly. I there once more met with my Friend Mr. <HI>Mu&s;grave,</HI> and the re&s;t of my Companions who had given me over for lo&s;t; for Captain <HI>Walton</HI> told the Admiral and my Comrades, that I was certainly Murther'd by the <HI>Indians.</HI> I had all my Things re&s;tor'd me, that were brought in the <HI>Al|bion</HI> Frigate, that arriv'd about a Week before me with the Stores of the Fleet, after &s;he had been in the Dock at <HI>Plimouth</HI> and well mended. She al&s;o brought News of War being declared between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and the Death of his Sacred Maje&s;ty King <HI>William</HI> the Third, of Glo|rious
<PB N="171" REF="385">

We directed our Cour&s;e to Port <HI>Leogaon,</HI> where <HI>du Ca&s;&s;e</HI> was expected every Day: But when we came there we were inform'd that <HI>du Ca&s;&s;e</HI> was Sail'd for <HI>Carthagena,</HI> upon which we directed our Cour&s;e for that place, after having taken three Ships, one of Sixteen, another of Thirty, call'd <HI>Reine de Angelos,</HI> or the Queen of Angels, and another of Six Guns richly Laden, be&s;ide three Barks
<PB N="172" REF="386">
taken by Captain <HI>Con&s;table,</HI> in the <HI>Wind|&s;or,</HI> and a fourth Sunk, likewi&s;e a <HI>French</HI> Man of War of Forty Guns burnt.</P>
<P>On the 19<HI>th</HI> of <HI>August,</HI> O. S. about 10 in the Morning, we di&s;cover'd Ten Sail to the Ea&s;tward of us, which we bore up to, and found 'em to be the Fleet we were in que&s;t of; tho' there was Ten Sail, yet there was but Six Fighting Ships, the re&s;t were Store-Ships which made the be&s;t of their Way; &s;o when the Admiral came up with 'em we had but Six to Engage. The Line of Battle was form'd about three in the Afternoon, The <HI>Defiance</HI> led the Van, the <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> &s;econd, and <HI>Ben|bow</HI> in the <HI>Breda</HI> the third. The&s;e three kept pretty clo&s;e together, but the other four were a League behind. At four in the Afternoon we began the Engagement, but the <HI>Defiance</HI> after firing three Guns bore away to Leeward and lay there out of Gun-&s;hot all the Evening, &s;o that the whole &s;trength of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet lay upon the Admiral and the <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> till it was Dark. In the Night the <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> fell foul of our Ship, which &s;tartled a great many, that were not upon Deck, as believing it

might be a <HI>French</HI> Fire&s;hip, tho' we knew they had not one in the Fleet: But Fear, as well as Pa&s;&s;ion, blends our Rea&s;on. The Wind chop'd about in the Night, &s;o that we had the Weather-gage of 'em; upon which we bore down upon 'em, and en|gag'd for three Hours; but the <HI>Ruby,</HI> Captain <HI>Walton,</HI> was di&s;abl'd, and order'd by the Admiral to make for <HI>Port-Royal.</HI> My Man <HI>Indian Will,</HI> who was on Board, dre&s;s'd like an <HI>European,</HI> was terribly frighted with the Noi&s;e of our Guns; and every time he &s;aw the Fla&s;h of our Ene|my's Cannon, he wou'd &s;quat down upon the Deck, and lye flat upon his Belly for &s;ome time; one of our Men that was &s;hot in the Guts lay expiring, and <HI>Indian Will</HI> was getting away out of Danger, he &s;aid, but unfortunately &s;tumbled over the Dy|ing Man, who in the Pangs of Death gra&s;p'd <HI>Will</HI> &s;o fa&s;t, that he cry'd out lu&s;tily for Help, but it was more than I could do to unclench his Hand till he was quite Dead, and then we releas'd poor <HI>Will,</HI> frighted out of his Wits, who could not be prevail'd upon to come upon Deck any more till we told him we had done

Fighting. We took one Ship from the <HI>French,</HI> that they had taken from the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> in their Voyage. The Fight la&s;ted &s;ix Days, on and off; but the Admiral being wounded in the Thigh, and finding that, <HI>Wade, Kirby,</HI> and <HI>Hud&s;on,</HI> did not care for Fighting, we left 'em, after di&s;|abling two of their Ships, and directed our Cour&s;e back to <HI>Portugal.</HI> As &s;oon as we arriv'd there, the Admiral &s;ent Or|ders to confine Captain <HI>Con&s;table, Wade, Kirby,</HI> and <HI>Hud&s;on,</HI> and Summon'd a Court-Mar&s;hal, Try'd 'em, and found 'em Guilty of Cowardice, excluding <HI>Con&s;table;</HI> and accordingly the other Three were &s;ent to <HI>England</HI> to receive Sentence of Death, which was executed upon Two of 'em.

He had &s;everal rich <HI>Plantations</HI> in <HI>Jamai|ca,</HI> and many Slaves.

He was a Man belov'd of both Officers and Common Sailors; a Per&s;on of true Cou|rage, and Fortitude: For when he was wounded in the Engagement, he order'd the Carpenters to make him a Cradle, that he might be upon Deck to give Orders. Nothing went more near his Heart than this unfortunate Expedition; and the Sur|geons reported, that the Grief he conceiv'd from it, hinder'd the healing of his Wound, which was given with a Musket-Ball, and

<HI>November</HI> the 1&s;t, we were &s;eparated from the Fleet by a dreadful Storm, that threw all our Ma&s;ts by the Board, and our Bolt&s;prit was al&s;o Sprung, but we fi&s;h'd that which pre&s;erv'd it. We were in a very pitiful Condition, and I am &s;ure in great Danger, for I really heard &s;ome of the Sailors at their Prayers. We lo&s;t two of our Men, who fell with the Main-ma&s;t overboard.

We had Captain <HI>Titchburn</HI>'s Company of <HI>Marines,</HI> and Major <HI>Bowls,</HI> Major of the Regiment that did belong to Colonel <HI>Jones,</HI> who dy'd in the Voyage, &s;o that having above our Com|plement, our Provi&s;ion began to be at an Ebb, which obliged us all to come to half-allowance, and half a Pint of Water a Day to each Man, for we did not know how long we &s;hould be out at Sea; but we made <HI>Ireland</HI> beyond all our Hopes <HI>November</HI> the 20<HI>th,</HI> and got &s;afe into <HI>Gallaway</HI> Harbour on the 23<HI>d,</HI> and it was a great Providence we did &s;o; for on the 25<HI>th</HI> there aro&s;e &s;uch a violent Storm, that mu&s;t have inevitably de&s;troyed us. This was that fatal Hurricane that did &s;o much Dammage in <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. There was two Ships in <HI>Gallaway</HI> Harbour that was &s;tranded, and it was allowed by every Body that we &s;hould have run the &s;ame Fate, if our Ma&s;ts had been &s;tanding; but having none but Jury-Ma&s;ts, which we took down when the Storm began to be pretty high, &s;o that the Wind could not have the &s;ame Power over us; neither do I think shat the Storm was &s;o violent in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by all De&s;cription, as it was in <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> We &s;tay'd at <HI>Gallaway</HI> four Months, and in that time we had got Ma&s;ts up and repair'd our other Dammages. While the Ship was fitting up, I lay on &s;hore in the Town. <HI>Gallaway</HI> is a
<PB N="224" REF="392">
neat well-fortify'd Town, as big as <HI>Salisbury,</HI> yet has but one Church. Every thing is very cheap there. I had my Board in a private Hou&s;e for four Shillings <HI>per</HI> Week, and &s;eldom Din'd without two or three Di&s;hes at Table: We bought the be&s;t <HI>French</HI> Wine for Fourteen pence <HI>per</HI> Quart, and &s;ometimes under. We &s;et Sail from <HI>Gallaway, February</HI> the 27<HI>th,</HI> 1704, and arrived &s;afely at <HI>Plymouth.</HI> Thus after many Misfortunes and Ha|zards I once more &s;et my Feet upon my dear na|tive Country (accompany'd with <HI>Indian Will,</HI> who &s;till lives with me, and proves an hone&s;t faithful Servant; and I have taken Pains to have him in|&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian Religion, and likewi&s;e to have him Chri&s;tned by the Name of <HI>William Domi|nico,</HI> from the I&s;land that he came from;) and tho' warn'd by many Dangers I had run, I could not forbear making three Voyages more, but yet in a Station different from what I went before. But as they were but common Voyages, that is nothing extraordinary happening, I &s;hall conclude with my Prayers and Thanks to Heaven for the many Mercies I have received; wi&s;hing long Life and Happine&s;s to my King, Pro&s;perity, Peace, and Riches to my Coun|try, and a hearty Union among my Fellow Subjects.</P>
