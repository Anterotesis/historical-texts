<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I COULD hardly flatter my&s;elf with the hope, that &s;o very early in the &s;ea&s;on I &s;hould have to acknowledge obligations to the Duke of Bedford and to the Earl of Lauderdale. The&s;e noble per&s;ons have lo&s;t no time in conferring upon me, that &s;ort of honour, which it is alone within their competence, and which it is cer|tainly mo&s;t congenial to their nature and their manners to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>To be ill &s;poken of, in whatever language they &s;peak, by the zealots of the new &s;ect in philo&s;ophy and politicks, of which the&s;e noble per&s;ons think &s;o charitably, and of which others think &s;o ju&s;tly, to me, is no matter of unea&s;ine&s;s or &s;urpri&s;e. To have incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Duke of Orleans or the Duke of Bedford, to
<PB N="2" REF="4">
fall under the cen&s;ure of Citizen Bri&s;&s;ot or of his friend the Earl of Lauderdale, I ought to con&s;ider as proofs, not the lea&s;t &s;atisfactory, that I have produced &s;ome part of the effect I propo&s;ed by my endeavours. I have laboured hard to earn, what the noble Lords are generous enough to pay. Per&s;onal offence I have given them none. The part they take again&s;t me is from zeal to the cau&s;e. It is well! It is perfectly well! I have to do homage to their ju&s;tice. I have to thank the Bedfords and the Lauderdales for having &s;o faithfully and &s;o fully acquitted to|wards me whatever arrear of debt was left un|di&s;charged by the Prie&s;tleys and the Paines.</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, may think them executors in their own wrong: I at lea&s;t have nothing to complain of. They have gone beyond the demands of ju&s;tice. They have been (a little perhaps beyond their intention) favourable to me. They have been the means of bring|ing out, by their invectives, the hand&s;ome things which Lord Grenville has had the goodne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion to &s;ay in my be|half. Retired as I am from the world, and from all it's affairs and all it's plea&s;ures, I con|fe&s;s it does kindle, in my nearly extingui&s;hed
<PB N="3" REF="5">
feelings, a very vivid &s;atisfaction to be &s;o at|tacked and &s;o commended. It is &s;oothing to my wounded mind, to be commended by an able, vigorous, and well informed &s;tate&s;man, and at the very moment when he &s;tands forth with a manline&s;s and re&s;olution, worthy of him|&s;elf and of his cau&s;e, for the pre&s;ervation of the per&s;on and government of our Sovereign, and therein for the &s;ecurity of the laws, the liberties, the morals, and the lives of his people. To be in any fair way connected with &s;uch things, is indeed a di&s;tinction. No philo&s;ophy can make me above it: no melancholy can depre&s;s me &s;o low, as to make me wholly in&s;en&s;ible to &s;uch an honour.</P>
<P>Why will they not let me remain in ob&s;cu|rity and inaction? Are they apprehen&s;ive, that if an atom of me remains, the &s;ect has &s;omething to fear? Mu&s;t I be annihilated, le&s;t, like old <HI>John Zi&s;ca</HI>'s, my &s;kin might be made into a drum, to animate Europe to eternal battle, again&s;t a tyranny that threatens to overwhelm all Europe, and all the human race?</P>
<P>My Lord, it is a &s;ubject of aweful meditation. Before this of France, the annals of all time
<PB N="4" REF="6">
have not furni&s;hed an in&s;tance of a <HI>compleat</HI> revolution. That revolution &s;eems to have ex|tended even to the con&s;titution of the mind of man. It has this of wonderful in it, that it re|&s;embles what Lord Verulam &s;ays of the operations of nature: It was perfect, not only in all its ele|ments and principles, but in all it's members and it's organs from the very beginning. The moral &s;cheme of France furni&s;hes the only pattern ever known, which they who admire will <HI>in&s;tantly</HI> re&s;emble. It is indeed an inexhau&s;tible reper|tory of one kind of examples. In my wretched condition, though hardly to be cla&s;&s;ed with the living, I am not &s;afe from them. They have tygers to fall upon animated &s;trength. They have hyenas to prey upon carca&s;&s;es. The national menagerie is collected by the fir&s;t phy|&s;iologi&s;ts of the time; and it is defective in no de&s;cription of &s;avage nature. They pur&s;ue, even &s;uch as me, into the ob&s;cure&s;t retreats, and haul them before their revolutionary tribunals. Nei|ther &s;ex, nor age&mdash;not the &s;anctuary of the tomb is &s;acred to them. They have &s;o determined a hatred to all privileged orders, that they deny even to the departed, the &s;ad immunities of the grave. They are not wholly without an ob|ject. Their turpitude purveys to their malice;
<PB N="5" REF="7">
and they unplumb the dead for bullets to a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inate the living. If all revolutioni&s;ts were not proof again&s;t all caution, I &s;hould recommend it to their con&s;ideration, that no per&s;ons were ever known in hi&s;tory, either &s;acred or profane, to vex the &s;epulchre, and by their &s;orceries, to call up the prophetic dead, with any other event, than the prediction of their own di&s;a&s;trous fate&punc; &mdash;"Leave, oh leave me to repo&s;e!"</P>
<P>In one thing I can excu&s;e the Duke of Bed|ford for his attack upon me and my mortuary pen&s;ion. He cannot readily comprehend the tran&s;action he condemns. What I have ob|tained was the fruit of no bargain; the produc|tion of no intrigue; the re&s;ult of no compromi&s;e; the effect of no &s;olicitation. The fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion of it never came from me, mediately or imme|diately, to his Maje&s;ty or any of his Mini&s;ters. It was long known that the in&s;tant my engage|ments would permit it, and before the heavie&s;t of all calamities had for ever condemned me to ob&s;curity and &s;orrow, I had re&s;olved on a total retreat. I had executed that de&s;ign. I was entirely out of the way of &s;erving or of hurting any &s;tate&s;man, or any party, when the Mini&s;ters &s;o generou&s;ly and &s;o nobly carried
<PB N="6" REF="8">
into effect the &s;pontaneous bounty of the Crown. Both de&s;criptions have acted as became them. When I could no longer &s;erve them, the Mini|&s;ters have con&s;idered my &s;ituation. When I could no longer hurt them, the revolutioni&s;ts have trampled on my infirmity. My gratitude, I tru&s;t, is equal to the manner in which the be|nefit was conferred. It came to me indeed, at a time of life, and in a &s;tate of mind and body, in which no circum&s;tance of fortune could af|ford me any real plea&s;ure. But this was no fault in the Royal Donor, or in his Mini&s;ters, who were plea&s;ed, in acknowledging the merits of an invalid &s;ervant of the publick, to a&s;&s;uage the &s;orrows of a de&s;olate old man.</P>
<P>It would ill become me to boa&s;t of any thing. It would as ill become me, thus called upon, to depreciate the value of a long life, &s;pent with unexampled toil in the &s;ervice of my country. Since the total body of my &s;ervices, on ac|count of the indu&s;try which was &s;hewn in them, and the fairne&s;s of my intentions, have ob|tained the acceptance of my Sovereign, it would be ab&s;urd in me to range my&s;elf on the &s;ide of the Duke of Bedford and the Corre&s;ponding Society, or, as far as in me lies, to permit a di&s;|pute on the rate at which the authority appointed
<PB N="7" REF="9">
by <HI>our</HI> Con&s;titution to e&s;timate &s;uch things, has been plea&s;ed to &s;et them.</P>
<P>Loo&s;e libels ought to be pa&s;&s;ed by in &s;ilence and contempt. By me they have been &s;o al|ways. I knew that as long as I remained in publick, I &s;hould live down the calumnies of malice, and the judgments of ignorance. If I happened to be now and then in the wrong, as who is not, like all other men, I mu&s;t bear the con&s;equence of my faults and my mi&s;takes. The libels of the pre&s;ent day, are ju&s;t of the &s;ame &s;tuff as the libels of the pa&s;t. But they derive an importance from the rank of the per|&s;ons they come from, and the gravity of the place where they were uttered. In &s;ome way or other I ought to take &s;ome notice of them. To a&s;&s;ert my&s;elf thus traduced is not vanity or arro|gance. It is a demand of ju&s;tice; it is a demon|&s;tration of gratitude. If I am unworthy, the Mini&s;ters are wor&s;e than prodigal. On that hy|pothe&s;is, I perfectly agree with the Duke of Bed|ford.</P>
<P>For whatever I have been (I am now no more) I put my&s;elf on my country. I ought to be allowed a rea&s;onable freedom, becau&s;e I &s;tand upon my deliverance; and no culprit ought to
<PB N="8" REF="10">
plead in irons. Even in the utmo&s;t latitude of defen&s;ive liberty, I wi&s;h to pre&s;erve all po&s;&s;ible decorum. Whatever it may be in the eyes of the&s;e noble per&s;ons them&s;elves, to me, their &s;ituation calls for the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect. If I &s;hould happen to tre&s;pa&s;s a little, which I tru&s;t I &s;hall not, let it always be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a con|fu&s;ion of characters may produce mi&s;takes; that in the ma&s;querades of the grand carnival of our age, whim&s;ical adventures happen; odd things are &s;aid and pa&s;s off. If I &s;hould fail a &s;ingle point in the high re&s;pect I owe to tho&s;e illu&s;trious per&s;ons, I cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed to mean the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale of the Hou&s;e of Peers, but the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauder|dale of Palace Yard;&mdash;The Dukes and Earls of Brentford. There they are on the pavement; there they &s;eem to come nearer to my humble level; and, virtually at lea&s;t, to have waved their high privilege.</P>
<P>Making this prote&s;tation, I refu&s;e all re|volutionary tribunals, where men have been put to death for no other rea&s;on, than that they had obtained favours from the Crown. I claim, not the letter, but the &s;pirit of the old Engli&s;h law, that is, to be tried by my peers. I decline
<PB N="9" REF="11">
his Grace's juri&s;diction as a judge. I challenge the Duke of Bedford as a juror to pa&s;s upon the value of my &s;ervices. Whatever his natural parts may be, I cannot recognize in his few and idle years, the competence to judge of my long and laborious life. If I can help it, he &s;hall not be on the inque&s;t of my <HI>quantum meruit.</HI> Poor rich man! He can hardly know any thing of publick indu&s;try in it's exertions, or can e&s;timate it's com|pen&s;ations when it's work is done. I have no doubt of his Grace's readine&s;s in all the calcula|tions of vulgar arithmetick; but I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;|pect, that he is very little &s;tudied in the theory of moral proportions; and has never learned the Rule of Three in the arithmetick of policy and &s;tate.</P>
<P>His Grace thinks I have obtained too much. I an&s;wer, that my exertions, whatever they have been, were &s;uch as no hopes of pecuniary reward could po&s;&s;ibly excite; and no pecuniary compen&s;a|tion can po&s;&s;ibly reward them. Between money and &s;ervices of this kind, (I &s;aid it long &s;ince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Speech on Oeconomical Reform, 1780.</NOTE>, when I was not my&s;elf concerned) there is no com|mon mea&s;urer. Money is made for the comfort and convenience of animal life. It cannot be a re|ward for what, mere animal life mu&s;t indeed &s;u&s;|tain,
<PB N="10" REF="12">
but never can in&s;pire. With &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his Grace, I have not had more than &s;uffi|cient. As to any noble u&s;e, I tru&s;t I know how to employ, as well as he, a much greater fortune than he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. In a more confined applica|tion, I certainly &s;tand in need of every kind of relief and ea&s;ement much more than he does. When I &s;ay I have not received more than I de|&s;erve, is this the language I hold to Maje&s;ty? No! Far, very far, from it! Before that pre&s;ence, I claim no merit at all. Every thing towards me is favour, and bounty. One &s;tyle to a gracious benefactor; another to a proud and in&s;ulting foe.</P>
<P>His Grace is plea&s;ed to aggravate my guilt, by charging my acceptance of his Maje&s;ty's grant as a departure from my ideas, and the &s;pirit of my conduct with regard to oecono|my. If it be, my ideas of oeconomy were fal&s;e and ill founded. But they are the Duke of Bedford's ideas of oeconomy I have contradicted, and not my own. If he means to allude to cer|tain bills brought in by me on a me&s;&s;age from the throne in 1782, I tell him, that there is no|thing in my conduct that can contradict either the letter or the &s;pirit of tho&s;e acts.&mdash;Does he mean the pay-office act? I take it for granted he does not. The act to which he alludes is,
<PB N="11" REF="13">
I &s;uppo&s;e, the e&s;tabli&s;hment act. I greatly doubt whether his Grace has ever read the one or the other. The fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;y&s;tems co&s;t me, with every a&s;&s;i&s;tance which my then &s;ituation gave me, pains incredible. I found an opinion common through all the offices, and general in the pub|lick at large, that it would prove impo&s;&s;ible to reform and methodize the office of Payma&s;ter General. I undertook it, however; and I &s;uc|ceeded in my undertaking. Whether the mili|tary &s;ervice, or whether the general oeconomy of our finances have profited by that act, I leave to tho&s;e who are acquainted with the army, and with the trea&s;ury, to judge.</P>
<P>An opinion full as general prevailed al&s;o at the &s;ame time, that nothing could be done for the re|gulation of the civil-li&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment. The very attempt to introduce method into it, and any li|mitations to it's &s;ervices, was held ab&s;urd. I had not &s;een the man, who &s;o much as &s;ugge&s;t|ed one oeconomical principle, or an oeconomical expedient, upon that &s;ubject. Nothing but coar&s;e amputation, or coar&s;er taxation, were then talked of, both of them without de&s;ign, combination, or the lea&s;t &s;hadow of principle. Blind and headlong zeal, or factious fury, were the whole contribution brought by the mo&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="14">
noi&s;y on that occa&s;ion, towards the &s;atisfaction of the publick, or the relief of the Crown.</P>
<P>Let me tell my youthful Cen&s;or, that the nece&s;&s;ities of that time required &s;omething very different from what others then &s;ug|ge&s;ted, or what his Grace now conceives. Let me inform him, that it was one of the mo&s;t cri|tical periods in our annals.</P>
<P>A&s;tronomers have &s;uppo&s;ed, that if a certain comet, who&s;e path inter&s;ected the ecliptick, had met the earth in &s;ome (I forget what) &s;ign, it would have whirled us along with it, in it's ex|centrick cour&s;e, into God knows what regions of heat and cold. Had the portentous comet of the rights of man, (which
<Q REND="inline">"from it's horrid hair &s;hakes pe&s;tilence, and war,"</Q>
and
<Q REND="inline">"with fear of change perplexes Monarchs"</Q>)
had that comet cro&s;&s;ed upon us in that internal &s;tate of Eng|land, nothing human could have prevented our being irre&s;i&s;tibly hurried, out of the highway of heaven, into all the vices, crimes, horrours and mi&s;eries of the French revolution.</P>
<P>Happily, France was not then jacobinized. Her ho&s;tility was at a good di&s;tance. We had a limb cut off; but we pre&s;erved the body: We
<PB N="13" REF="15">
lo&s;t our Colonies; but we kept our Con&s;titu|tion. There was, indeed, much inte&s;tine heat; there was a dreadful fermentation. Wild and &s;avage in&s;urrection quitted the woods, and prowled about our &s;treets in the name of re|form. Such was the di&s;temper of the publick mind, that there was no madman, in his madde&s;t ideas, and madde&s;t projects, who might not count upon numbers to &s;upport his principles and execute his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Many of the changes, by a great mi&s;nomer called parliamentary reforms, went, not in the intention of all the profe&s;&s;ors and &s;upporters of them, undoubtedly, but went in their certain, and, in my opinion, not very remote effect, home to the utter de&s;truction of the Con&s;titution of this kingdom. Had they taken place, not France, but England, would have had the honour of leading up the death-dance of Democratick Re|volution. Other projects, exactly coincident in time with tho&s;e, &s;truck at the very exi&s;tence of the kingdom under any con&s;titution. There are who remember the blind fury of &s;ome, and the lamentable helple&s;&s;ne&s;s of others; here, a torpid confu&s;ion, from a panic fear of the danger; there, the &s;ame inaction from a &s;tupid in&s;en&s;ibi|lity to it; here, well-wi&s;hers to the mi&s;chief;

there, indifferent lookers-on. At the &s;ame time, a &s;ort of National Convention, dubious in its nature, and perilous in its example, no&s;ed Parliament in the very &s;eat of its authority; &s;at with a &s;ort of &s;uperintendance over it; and little le&s;s than dictated to it, not only laws, but the very form and e&s;&s;ence of Legi&s;lature it&s;elf. In Ireland things ran in a &s;till more eccentrick cour&s;e. Government was unnerved, confounded, and in a manner &s;u&s;pended. It's equipoi&s;e was totally gone. I do not mean to &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of Lord North. He was a man of admirable parts; of general knowledge; of a ver&s;atile under&s;tanding fitted for every &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s; of infinite wit and plea&s;antry; of a delightful temper; and with a mind mo&s;t perfectly di&s;intere&s;ted. But it would be only to degrade my&s;elf by a weak adulation, and not to honour the memory of a great man&punc; to deny that he wanted &s;omething of the vi|gilance, and &s;pirit of command, that the time required. Indeed, a darkne&s;s, next to the fog of this awful day, loured over the whole region For a little time the helm appeared abandoned&mdash;

as much as the Duke of Bedford can do; and they under&s;tood it at lea&s;t as well. Perhaps their politicks, as u&s;ual, took a tincture from their character, and they cultivated what they loved. The Liberty they pur&s;ued was a Liberty in&s;eparable from order, from virtue, from morals, and from religion, and was neither hypocritically nor fanatically followed. They did not wi&s;h, that Liberty, in it&s;elf one of the fir&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings, &s;hould in it's perver&s;ion become the greate&s;t cur&s;e which could fall upon man|kind. To pre&s;erve the Con&s;titution entire, and practically equal to all the great ends of it's for|mation, not in one &s;ingle part, but in all it's parts, was to them the fir&s;t object. Popularity and power they regarded alike. The&s;e were with them only different means of obtaining that ob|ject; and had no preference over each other in their minds, but as one or the other might af|ford a &s;urer or a le&s;s certain pro&s;pect of arriving at that end. It is &s;ome con&s;olation to me, in the chearle&s;s gloom which darkens the evening of my life, that with them I commenced my political career, and never for a moment, in reality, nor in appearance, for any length of time, was &s;eparated from their good wi&s;hes and good opinion.</P>
<P>By what accident it matters not, nor upon what de&s;ert, but ju&s;t then, and in the mid&s;t of
<PB N="16" REF="20">
that hunt of obloquy, which ever has pur&s;ued me with a full cry through life, I had obtained a very con&s;iderable degree of publick confi|dence. I know well enough how equivocal a te&s;t this kind of popular opinion forms of the merit that obtained it. I am no &s;tranger to the in&s;ecurity of it's tenure. I do not boa&s;t of it. It is mentioned, to &s;hew, not how highly I prize the thing, but my right to value the u&s;e I made of it. I endeavoured to turn that &s;hort-lived advantage to my&s;elf into a permanent benefit to my Country. Far am I from detracting from the merit of &s;ome Gentlemen, out of office or in it, on that occa&s;ion. No!&mdash;It is not my way to refu&s;e a full and heaped mea&s;ure of ju&s;tice to the aids that I receive. I have, through life, been willing to give every thing to others; and to re&s;erve nothing for my&s;elf, but the inward con&s;cience, that I had omitted no pains to di&s;cover, to animate, to di&s;cipline, to di|rect the abilities of the Country for it's &s;er|vice, and to place them in the be&s;t light to improve their age, or to adorn it. This con|&s;cience I have. I have never &s;uppre&s;&s;ed any man; never checked him for a moment in his cour&s;e, by any jealou&s;y, or by any policy. I was always ready, to the height of my means (and they were always infinitely below my de&s;ires) to for|ward tho&s;e abilities which overpowered my own.

He is an ill-furni&s;hed undertaker, who has no machinery but his own hands to work with. Poor in my own faculties, I ever thought my&s;elf rich in theirs. In that period of difficulty and dan|ger, more e&s;pecially, I con&s;ulted, and &s;incerely co-operated with men of all parties, who &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to the &s;ame ends, or to any main part of them. Nothing, to prevent di&s;order, was omitted: when it appeared, nothing to &s;ubdue it, was left uncoun&s;elled, nor unexecuted, as far as I could prevail. At the time I &s;peak of, and having a momentary lead, &s;o aided and &s;o encouraged, and as a feeble in&s;trument in a mighty hand&mdash;I do not &s;ay, I &s;aved my Country; I am &s;ure I did my Country important &s;ervice.

<P>So much for my general conduct through the whole of the portentous cri&s;is from 1780 to 1782, and the general &s;en&s;e then entertained of that conduct by my country.

France, and &s;preading thence, threaten the po|litical and moral order of the whole world, that it &s;eems to demand &s;omething of a more detail|ed di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>My oeconomical reforms were not, as his Grace may think, the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of a paltry pen|&s;ion or employment, more or le&s;s. Oeconomy in my plans was, as it ought to be, &s;econdary, &s;ub|ordinate, in&s;trumental. I acted on &s;tate prin|ciples. I found a great di&s;temper in the com|monwealth; and, according to the nature of the evil and of the object, I treated it. The malady was deep; it was complicated, in the cau&s;es and in the &s;ymptoms. Throughout it was full of con|tra-indicants. On one hand Government, daily growing more invidious for an apparent increa&s;e of the means of &s;trength, was every day growing more contemptible by real weakne&s;s. Nor was this di&s;&s;olution confined to Government com|monly &s;o called. It extended to Parliament; which was lo&s;ing not a little in it's dignity and e&s;timation, by an opinion of it's not acting on worthy motives. On the other hand, the de&s;ires of the People, (partly na|tural and partly infu&s;ed into them by art) ap|peared in &s;o wild and incon&s;iderate a man|ner, with regard to the oeconomical object
<PB N="19" REF="23">
(for I &s;et a&s;ide for a moment the dreadful tam|pering with the body of the Con&s;titution it&s;elf) that if their petitions had literally been complied with, the State would have been convul&s;ed; and a gate would have been opened, through which all property might be &s;acked and ravaged. Nothing could have &s;aved the Publick from the mi&s;chiefs of the fal&s;e reform but it's ab&s;urdity; which would &s;oon have brought it&s;elf, and with it all real reform, into di&s;credit. This would have left a rankling wound in the hearts of the people who would know they had failed in the accom|pli&s;hment of their wi&s;hes, but who, like the re&s;t of mankind in all ages, would impute the blame to any thing rather than to their own proceedings. But there were then per&s;ons in the world, who nouri&s;hed complaint; and would have been tho|roughly di&s;appointed if the people were ever &s;a|tisfied. I was not of that humour. I wi&s;hed that they <HI>&s;hould</HI> be &s;atisfied. It was my aim to give to the People the &s;ub&s;tance of what I knew they de&s;ired, and what I thought was right whether they de&s;ired it or not, before it had been modified for them into &s;en&s;ele&s;s petitions. I knew that there is a manife&s;t marked di&s;tinc|tion, which ill men, with ill de&s;igns, or weak men incapable of any de&s;ign, will con&s;tantly be confounding, that is, a marked di&s;tinction be|tween

Change and Reformation. The former alters the &s;ub&s;tance of the objects them&s;elves; and gets rid of all their e&s;&s;ential good, as well as of all the accidental evil annexed to them. Change is novelty; and whether it is to operate any one of the effects of reformation at all, or whether it may not contradict the very principle upon which reformation is de&s;ired, cannot be cer|tainly known beforehand. Reform is, not a change in the &s;ub&s;tance, or in the primary mo|dification of the object, but a direct application of a remedy to the grievance complained of. So far as that is removed, all is &s;ure. It &s;tops there; and if it fails, the &s;ub&s;tance which un|derwent the operation, at the very wor&s;t, is but where it was.</P>
<P>All this, in effect, I think, but am not &s;ure, I have &s;aid el&s;ewhere.

The&s;e ob&s;cene harpies, who deck them&s;elves, in I know not what divine attributes, but who in reality are foul and ravenous birds of prey (both mothers and daughters) flutter over our heads, and &s;ou&s;e down upon our tables, and leave nothing unrent, unrifled, un|ravaged, or unpolluted with the &s;lime of their filthy offal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Tri&s;tius haud illis mon&s;trum, nec &s;aevior ulla</L>

<P><PB N="22" REF="26">If his Grace can contemplate the re&s;ult of this compleat innovation, or, as &s;ome friends of his will call it, <HI>reform,</HI> in the whole body of it's &s;olidity and compound ma&s;s, at which, as Ham|let &s;ays, the face of Heaven glows with horrour and indignation, and which, in truth, makes every reflecting mind, and every feeling heart, perfectly thought-&s;ick, without a thorough ab|horrence of every thing they &s;ay, and every thing they do, I am amazed at the morbid &s;trength, or the natural infirmity of his mind.</P>
<P>It was then not my love, but my hatred to innovation, that produced my Plan of Reform. Without troubling my&s;elf with the exactne&s;s of the logical diagram, I con&s;idered them as things &s;ub&s;tantially oppo&s;ite. It was to prevent that evil, that I propo&s;ed the mea&s;ures, which his Grace is plea&s;ed, and I am not &s;orry he is plea&s;|ed, to recall to my recollection. I had (what
<PB N="23" REF="27">
I hope that Noble Duke will remember in all his operations) a State to pre&s;erve, as well as a State to reform. I had a People to gratify, but not to inflame, or to mi&s;lead. I do not claim half the credit for what I did, as for what I prevented from being done. In that &s;ituation of the publick mind, I did not undertake, as was then propo&s;ed, to new model the Hou&s;e of Commons or the Hou&s;e of Lords; or to change the authority under which any officer of the Crown acted, who was &s;uffered at all to exi&s;t. Crown, Lords, Commons, judicial &s;y&s;tem, &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration, exi&s;ted as they had exi&s;ted before; and in the mode and manner in which they had always exi&s;ted. My mea&s;ures were, what I then truly &s;tated them to the Hou&s;e to be, in their intent, healing and medi|atorial. A complaint was made of too much influence in the Hou&s;e of Commons; I re|duced it in both Hou&s;es; and I gave my rea&s;ons article by article for every reduction, and &s;hewed why I thought it &s;afe for the &s;ervice of the State. I heaved the lead every inch of way I made. A di&s;po&s;ition to ex|pence was complained of; to that I op|po&s;ed, not mere retrenchment, but a &s;y&s;tem of oeconomy, which would make a random ex|pence without plan or fore&s;ight, in future not
<PB N="24" REF="28">
ea&s;ily practicable. I proceeded upon principles of re&s;earch to put me in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my mat|ter; on principles of method to regulate it; and on principles in the human mind and in civil affairs to &s;ecure and perpetuate the operation. I conceived nothing arbitrarily; nor propo&s;ed any thing to be done by the will and plea&s;ure of others, or my own; but by rea&s;on, and by rea&s;on only. I have ever abhorred, &s;ince the fir&s;t dawn of my under&s;tanding to this it's ob&s;cure twi|light, all the operations of opinion, fancy, in|clination, and will, in the affairs of Govern|ment, where only a &s;overeign rea&s;on, paramount to all forms of legi&s;lation and admini&s;tration, &s;hould dictate. Government is made for the very purpo&s;e of oppo&s;ing that rea&s;on to will and to caprice, in the reformers or in the reformed, in the governors or in the governed, in Kings, in Senates, or in People.</P>
<P>On a careful review, therefore, and analy&s;is of all the component parts of the Civil Li&s;t, and on weighing them each again&s;t other, in order to make, as much as po&s;&s;ible, all of them a &s;ub|ject of e&s;timate (the foundation and corner|&s;tone of all regular provident oeconomy) it ap|peared to me evident, that this was impracti|cable, whil&s;t that part, called the Pen&s;ion Li&s;t,
<PB N="25" REF="29">
was totally di&s;cretionary in it's amount. For this rea&s;on, and for this only, I propo&s;ed to re|duce it, both in it's gro&s;s quantity, and in it's larger individual proportions, to a certainty: le&s;t, if it were left without a <HI>general</HI> limit, it might eat up the Civil Li&s;t &s;ervice; if &s;uffered to be granted in portions too great for the fund, it might defeat it's own end; and by unlimited allowances to &s;ome, it might di&s;able the Crown in means of providing for others. The Pen&s;ion Li&s;t was to be kept as a &s;acred fund; but it could not be kept as a con&s;tant open fund, &s;ufficient for growing demands, if &s;ome demands could wholly devour it. The tenour of the Act will &s;hew that it re|garded the Civil Li&s;t <HI>only,</HI> the reduction of which to &s;ome &s;ort of e&s;timate was my great object.</P>
<P>No other of the Crown funds did I meddle with, becau&s;e they had not the &s;ame rela|tions. This of the four and a half per cents does his Grace imagine had e&s;caped me, or had e&s;caped all the men of bu&s;ine&s;s, who acted with me in tho&s;e regulations? I knew that &s;uch a fund exi&s;ted, and that pen&s;ions had been always granted on it, before his Grace was born. This fund was full in my eye. It was full in the eyes of tho&s;e who worked with me. It was left on principle. On principle I did what was then
<PB N="26" REF="30">
done; and on principle what was left undone was omitted. I did not dare to rob the nation of all funds to reward merit. If I pre&s;&s;ed this point too clo&s;e, I acted contrary to the avowed principles on which I went. Gentlemen are very fond of quoting me; but if any one thinks it worth his while to know the rules that guided me in my plan of reform, he will read my printed &s;peech on that &s;ubject; at lea&s;t what is contained from page 230 to page 241 in the &s;econd Volume of the collection which a friend has given him&s;elf the trouble to make of my publications. Be this as it may, the&s;e two Bills (though atchieved with the greate&s;t labour, and management of every &s;ort, both within and without the Hou&s;e) were only a part, and but a &s;mall part, of a very large &s;y&s;tem, comprehending all the objects I &s;tated in opening my propo&s;ition, and indeed many more, which I ju&s;t hinted at in my Speech to the Electors of Bri&s;tol, when I was put out of that repre&s;entation. All the&s;e, in &s;ome &s;tate or other of forwardne&s;s, I have long had by me.</P>
<P>But do I ju&s;tify his Maje&s;ty's grace on the&s;e grounds? I think them the lea&s;t of my &s;ervices! The time gave them an occa&s;ional value: What I have done in the way of political oeco|nomy was far from confined to this body of
<PB N="27" REF="31">
mea&s;ures. I did not come into Parliament to con my le&s;&s;on. I had earned my pen&s;ion before I &s;et my foot in St. Stephen's Chapel. I was prepared and di&s;ciplined to this political war|fare. The fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion I &s;at in Parliament, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to analyze the whole com|mercial, financial, con&s;titutional and foreign in|tere&s;ts of Great Britain and it's Empire. A great deal was then done; and more, far more would have been done, if more had been per|mitted by events. Then in the vigour of my manhood, my con&s;titution &s;unk under my la|bour. Had I then died, (and I &s;eemed to my|&s;elf very near death) I had then earned for tho&s;e who belonged to me, more than the Duke of Bedford's ideas of &s;ervice are of power to e&s;timate. But in truth, the&s;e &s;ervices I am called to ac|count for, are not tho&s;e on which I value my&s;elf the mo&s;t. If I were to call for a reward (which I have never done) it &s;hould be for tho&s;e in which for fourteen years, without intermi&s;&s;ion, I &s;hewed the mo&s;t indu&s;try, and had the lea&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;s; I mean in the affairs of India. They are tho&s;e on which I value my&s;elf the mo&s;t; mo&s;t for the importance; mo&s;t for the labour; mo&s;t for the judgment; mo&s;t for con&s;tancy and per&s;everance in the pur&s;uit. Others may value
<PB N="28" REF="32">
them mo&s;t for the <HI>intention.</HI> In that, &s;urely, they are not mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Does his Grace think, that they who ad|vi&s;ed the Crown to make my retreat ea&s;y, con|&s;idered me only as an oeconomi&s;t? That, well under&s;tood, however, is a good deal. If I had not deemed it of &s;ome value, I &s;hould not have made political oeconomy an object of my humble &s;tudies, from my very early youth to near the end of my &s;ervice in parliament, even before, (at lea&s;t to any knowledge of mine) it had employed the thoughts of &s;peculative men in other parts of Europe. At that time, it was &s;till in it's infancy in England, where, in the la&s;t century, it had it's origin. Great and learned men thought my &s;tudies were not wholly thrown away, and deigned to communicate with me now and then on &s;ome particulars of their immortal works. Something of the&s;e &s;tudies may appear incidentally in &s;ome of the ear|lie&s;t things I publi&s;hed. The Hou&s;e has been witne&s;s to their effect, and has profited of them more or le&s;s, for above eight and twenty years.</P>
<P>To their e&s;timate I leave the matter. I was not, like his Grace of Bedford, &s;waddled,
<PB N="29" REF="33">
and rocked, and dandled into a Legi&s;lator; "<HI>Nitor in adver&s;um</HI>" is the motto for a man like me. I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not one of the qualities, nor cultivated one of the arts, that recommend men to the favour and protection of the great. I was not made for a minion or a tool. As little did I follow the trade of winning the hearts, by impo&s;ing on the under&s;tandings, of the people. At every &s;tep of my progre&s;s in life (for in every &s;tep was I traver&s;ed and oppo&s;ed), and at every turnpike I met, I was obliged to &s;hew my pa&s;&s;|port, and again and again to prove my &s;ole title to the honour of being u&s;eful to my Country, by a proof that I was not wholly unacquainted with it's laws, and the whole &s;y&s;tem of it's intere&s;ts both abroad and at home. Otherwi&s;e no rank, no toleration even, for me. I had no arts, but manly arts. On them I have &s;tood, and, plea&s;e God, in &s;pite of the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to the la&s;t ga&s;p will I &s;tand.</P>
<P>Had his Grace conde&s;cended to enquire concerning the per&s;on, whom he has not thought it below him to reproach, he might have found, that in the whole cour&s;e of my life, I have ne|ver, on any pretence of oeconomy, or on any other pretence, &s;o much as in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, &s;tood between any man and his reward of
<PB N="30" REF="34">
&s;ervice, or his encouragement in u&s;eful talent and pur&s;uit, from the highe&s;t of tho&s;e &s;ervices and pur&s;uits to the lowe&s;t. On the contrary I have, on an hundred occa&s;ions, exerted my&s;elf with &s;ingular zeal to forward every man's even tolerable preten&s;ions. I have more than once had good-natured reprehen&s;ions from my friends for carrying the matter to &s;omething bordering on abu&s;e. This line of conduct, whatever it's merits might be, was partly owing to natural di&s;po&s;ition; but I think full as much to rea&s;on and principle. I looked on the con&s;i|deration of publick &s;ervice, or publick orna|ment, to be real and very ju&s;tice: and I ever held, a &s;canty and penurious ju&s;tice to partake of the nature of a wrong. I held it to be, in its con&s;equences, the wor&s;t oeconomy in the world. In &s;aving money, I &s;oon can count up all the good I do; but when by a cold penury, I bla&s;t the abilities of a nation, and &s;tunt the growth of it's active energies, the ill I may do is beyond all calculation. Whether it be too much or too little, whatever I have done has been ge|neral and &s;y&s;tematick. I have never entered into tho&s;e trifling vexations and oppre&s;&s;ive de|tails, that have been fal&s;ely, and mo&s;t ridicu|lou&s;ly laid to my charge.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="35">Did I blame the pen&s;ions given to Mr. Barr&eacute; and Mr. Dunning between the propo&s;ition and execution of my plan? No! &s;urely, no! Tho&s;e pen&s;ions were within my principles. I a&s;&s;ert it, tho&s;e gentlemen de&s;erved their pen&s;ions, their titles,&mdash;all they had; and if more they had, I &s;hould have been but plea&s;ed the more. They were men of talents; they were men of &s;ervice. I put the profe&s;&s;ion of the law out of the que&s;|tion in one of them. It is a &s;ervice that rewards it&s;elf. But their <HI>publick &s;ervice,</HI> though, from their abilities unque&s;tionably of more value than mine, in it's quantity and in it's duration was not to be mentioned with it. But I never could drive a hard bargain in my life, concerning any mat|ter whatever; and lea&s;t of all do I know how to haggle and huck&s;ter with merit. Pen&s;ion for my&s;elf I obtained none; nor did I &s;olicit any. Yet I was loaded with hatred for every thing that was with-held, and with obloquy for every thing that was given. I was thus left to &s;upport the grants of a name ever dear to me, and ever venerable to the world, in favour of tho&s;e, who were no friends of mine or of his, again&s;t the rude attacks of tho&s;e who were at that time friends to the grantees, and their own zealous partizans. I have never heard the Earl of Lau|derdale complain of the&s;e pen&s;ions. He finds
<PB N="32" REF="36">
nothing wrong till he comes to me. This is impartiality, in the true modern revolutionary &s;tyle.</P>
<P>Whatever I did at that time, &s;o far as it regard|ed order and oeconomy, is &s;table and eternal; as all principles mu&s;t be. A particular order of things may be altered; order it&s;elf cannot lo&s;e its value. As to other particulars, they are va|riable by time and by circum&s;tances. Laws of regulation are not fundamental laws. The pub|lick exigencies are the ma&s;ters of all &s;uch laws. They rule the laws, and are not to be ruled by them. They who exerci&s;e the legi&s;lative power at the time mu&s;t judge.</P>
<P>It may be new to his Grace, but I beg leave to tell him, that mere par&s;imony is not oecono|my. It is &s;eparable in theory from it; and in fact it may, or it may not, be a <HI>part</HI> of oeconomy, according to circum&s;tances. Expence, and great expence, may be an e&s;&s;ential part in true oecono|my. If par&s;imony were to be con&s;idered as one of the kinds of that virtue, there is however ano|ther and an higher oeconomy. Oeconomy is a di&s;tributive virtue, and con&s;i&s;ts not in &s;aving, but in &s;election. Par&s;imony requires no providence, no &s;agacity, no powers of combination, no com|pari&s;on,
<PB N="33" REF="37">
no judgment. Meer in&s;tinct, and that not an in&s;tinct of the noble&s;t kind, may produce this fal&s;e oeconomy in perfection. The other oeconomy has larger views. It demands a di&s;cri|minating judgment, and a firm &s;agacious mind. It &s;huts one door to impudent importunity, only to open another, and a wider, to unpre&s;uming merit. If none but meritorious &s;ervice or real talent were to be rewarded, this nation has not wanted, and this nation will not want, the means of rewarding all the &s;ervice it ever will receive, and encouraging all the merit it ever will produce. No &s;tate, &s;ince the foundation of &s;ociety, has been impoveri&s;hed by that &s;pecies of profu&s;ion. Had the oeconomy of &s;election and proportion been at all times ob&s;erved, we &s;hould not now have had an overgrown Duke of Bedford, to oppre&s;s the indu&s;try of humble men, and to limit by the &s;tandard of his own conceptions, the ju&s;tice, the bounty, or, if he plea&s;es, the charity of the Crown.</P>
<P>His Grace may think as meanly as he will of my de&s;erts in the far greater part of my conduct in life. It is free for him to do &s;o. There will always be &s;ome difference of opinion in the value of political &s;ervices. But there is one merit of mine, which he, of all men living, ought to be
<PB N="34" REF="38">
the la&s;t to call in que&s;tion. I have &s;upported with very great zeal, and I am told with &s;ome degree of &s;ucce&s;s, tho&s;e opinions, or if his Grace likes another expre&s;&s;ion better, tho&s;e old preju|dices which buoy up the ponderous ma&s;s of his nobility, wealth, and titles. I have omitted no exertion to prevent him and them from &s;inking to that level, to which the meretricious French faction, his Grace at lea&s;t coquets with, omit no exertion to reduce both. I have done all I could to di&s;countenance their enquiries into the for|tunes of tho&s;e, who hold large portions of wealth without any apparent merit of their own. I have &s;trained every nerve to keep the Duke of Bed|ford in that &s;ituation, which alone makes him my &s;uperior. Your Lord&s;hip has been a wit|ne&s;s of the u&s;e he makes of that pre-eminence.</P>
<P>But be it, that this is virtue! Be it, that there is virtue in this well &s;elected rigour; yet all vir|tues are not equally becoming to all men and at all times. There are crimes, undoubtedly there are crimes, which in all &s;ea&s;ons of our exi&s;tence, ought to put a generous antipathy in action; crimes that provoke an indignant ju&s;tice, and call forth a warm and animated pur&s;uit. But all things, that concern, what I may call, the preventive police of morality, all things mere|ly

rigid, har&s;h and cen&s;orial, the antiquated mo|rali&s;ts, at who&s;e feet I was brought up, would not have thought the&s;e the fitte&s;t matter to form the favourite virtues of young men of rank. What might have been well enough, and have been re|ceived with a veneration mixed with awe and terrour, from an old, &s;evere, crabbed Cato, would have wanted &s;omething of propriety in the young Scipios, the ornament of the Roman Nobility, in the flower of their life. But the times, the mo|rals, the ma&s;ters, the &s;cholars have all under|gone a thorough revolution. It is a vile illibe|ral &s;chool, this new French academy of the <HI>&s;ans culottes.</HI> There is nothing in it that is fit for a Gentleman to learn.</P>
<P>Whatever it's vogue may be, I &s;till flatter my&s;elf, that the parents of the growing ge|neration will be &s;atisfied with what is to be taught to their children in We&s;tmin&s;ter, in Eaton, or in Winche&s;ter: I &s;till indulge the hope that no <HI>grown</HI> Gentleman or Nobleman of our time will think of fini&s;hing at Mr. Thelwall's lecture whatever may have been left incompleat at the old Univer&s;ities of his country. I would give to Lord Grenville and Mr. Pitt for a motto, what was &s;aid of a Roman Cen&s;or or Praetor (or

<P>The awful &s;tate of the time, and not my&s;elf or my own ju&s;tification, is my true object in what I now write; or in what I &s;hall ever write or &s;ay. It little &s;ignifies to the world what becomes of &s;uch things as me, or even as the Duke of Bed|ford. What I &s;ay about either of us is nothing more than a vehicle, as you, my Lord, will ea|&s;ily perceive, to convey my &s;entiments on matters far more worthy of your attention. It is when I &s;tick to my apparent fir&s;t &s;ubject that I ought to apologize, not when I depart from it.

Homer nods; and the Duke of Bedford may dream; and as dreams (even his golden dreams) are apt to be ill-pieced and in|congruou&s;ly put together, his Grace pre&s;erved his idea of reproach to <HI>me,</HI> but took the &s;ubject-matter from the Crown-grants <HI>to his own fa|mily.</HI> This is "the &s;tuff of which his dreams are made." In that way of putting things toge|ther his Grace is perfectly in the right. The grants to the Hou&s;e of Ru&s;&s;el were &s;o enormous, as not only to outrage oeconomy, but even to &s;tagger credibility. The Duke of Bedford is the Leviathan among all the creatures of the Crown. He tumbles about his unwieldy bulk; he plays and frolicks in the ocean of the Royal bounty. Huge as he is, and whil&s;t "he lies floating many a rood," he is &s;till a creature. His ribs, his fins, his whalebone, his blubber, the very &s;piracles through which he &s;pouts a torrent of brine again&s;t his origin, and covers me all over with

the &s;pray,&mdash;every thing of him and about him is from the Throne. Is it for <HI>him</HI> to que&s;tion the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Royal favour?</P>
<P>I really am at a lo&s;s to draw any &s;ort of pa|rallel between the publick merits of his Grace, by which he ju&s;tifies the grants he holds, and the&s;e &s;ervices of mine, on the favourable con&s;truction of which I have obtained what his Grace &s;o much di&s;approves. In private life, I have not at all the honour of acquaintance with the noble Duke. But I ought to pre&s;ume, and it co&s;ts me nothing to do &s;o, that he abundantly de|&s;erves the e&s;teem and love of all who live with him. But as to publick &s;ervice, why truly it would not be more ridiculous for me to com|pare my&s;elf in rank, in fortune, in &s;plendid de|&s;cent, in youth, &s;trength, or figure, with the Duke of Bedford, than to make a parallel between his &s;ervices, and my attempts to be u&s;eful to my country. It would not be gro&s;s adulation, but uncivil irony, to &s;ay, that he has any publick merit of his own to keep alive the idea of the &s;ervices by which his va&s;t landed Pen&s;ions were obtained. My merits, whatever they are, are original and per&s;onal; his are de|rivative. It is his ance&s;tor, the original pen|&s;ioner, that has laid up this inexhau&s;tible fund
<PB N="39" REF="43">
of merit, which makes his Grace &s;o very deli|cate and exceptions about the merit of all other grantees of the Crown. Had he permitted me to remain in quiet, I &s;hould have &s;aid 'tis his e&s;tate; that's enough. It is his by law; what have I to do with it or it's hi&s;tory? He would naturally have &s;aid on his &s;ide, 'tis this man's fortune.&mdash;He is as good now, as my ance&s;tor was two hundred and fifty years ago. I am a young man with very old pen&s;ions; he is an old man with very young pen&s;ions,&mdash;that's all?</P>
<P>Why will his Grace, by attacking me, force me reluctantly to compare my little merit with that which obtained from the Crown tho&s;e pro|digies of profu&s;e donation by which he tramples on the mediocrity of humble and laborious indi|viduals? I would willingly leave him to the He|rald's College, which the philo&s;ophy of the Sans culottes, (prouder by far than all the Garters, and Norroys and Clarencieux, and Rouge Dragons that ever pranced in a proce&s;&s;ion of what his friends call ari&s;tocrates and de&s;pots) will aboli&s;h with contumely and &s;corn.

<P>To the&s;e recorders, &s;o full of good nature to the great and pro&s;perous, I would willingly leave the fir&s;t Baron Ru&s;&s;el, and Earl of Bedford, and the merits of his grants. But the aulnager, the weigher, the meter of grants, will not &s;uffer us to acquie&s;ce in the judgment of the Prince reign|ing at the time when they were made.

<P><PB N="41" REF="45">The fir&s;t peer of the name, the fir&s;t pur|cha&s;er of the grants, was a Mr. Ru&s;&s;el, a per|&s;on of an ancient gentleman's family, rai&s;ed by being a minion of Henry the Eighth.

<P><PB N="47" REF="51">Thus &s;tands the account of the comparative merits of the Crown grants which compo&s;e the Duke of Bedford's fortune as balanced again&s;t mine.

Why &s;hould he ima|gine that no King of England has been capable of judging of merit but King Henry the Eighth? Indeed, he will pardon me; he is a little mi&s;|taken; all virtue did not end in the fir&s;t Earl of Bedford. All di&s;cernment did not lo&s;e it's vi|&s;ion when his Creator clo&s;ed his eyes. Let him remit his rigour on the di&s;proportion between merit and reward in others, and they will make no enquiry into the origin of his fortune.

It is little to be doubted, that &s;everal of his forefathers in that long &s;eries, have degenerated into honour and virtue.

<P>Then will be forgot the rebellions, which, by a doubtful priority in crime, his ance&s;tor had provoked and extingui&s;hed. On &s;uch a conduct in the noble Duke, many of his countrymen might, and with &s;ome excu&s;e might, give way to the enthu&s;ia&s;m of their gratitude, and in the da&s;hing &s;tyle of &s;ome of the old declaimers, cry out, that if the fates had found no other way in which they could give a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At &s;i non aliam venturo fata Neroni, &amp;c.</NOTE>Duke of Bedford and his opulence as props to a tottering world, then the butchery of the Duke of Buckingham might be tolerated; it might be regarded even with complacency, whil&s;t in the heir of confi&s;cation they &s;aw the &s;ympathizing comforter of the martyrs, who &s;uffer under the cruel confi&s;cation of this day; whil&s;t they beheld with admiration

<P>Had it plea&s;ed God to continue to me the hopes of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, I &s;hould have been, ac|cording to my mediocrity, and the mediocrity of the age I live in, a &s;ort of founder of a family; I &s;hould have left a &s;on, who, in all the points in which per&s;onal merit can be viewed, in &s;ci|ence, in erudition, in genius, in ta&s;te, in honour, in genero&s;ity, in humanity, in every liberal &s;enti|ment, and every liberal accompli&s;hment, would not have &s;hewn him&s;elf inferior to the Duke of Bedford, or to any of tho&s;e whom he traces in his line. His Grace very &s;oon would have wanted all plau&s;ibility in his attack upon that provi&s;ion which belonged more to mine than to me.

wa&s;ting re&s;ervoir of merit in me, or in any ance&s;try. He had in him&s;elf a &s;alient, living &s;pring, of generous and manly action.

<P>But a di&s;po&s;er who&s;e power we are little able to re&s;i&s;t, and who&s;e wi&s;dom it behoves us not at all to di&s;pute; has ordained it in another manner, and (whatever my querulous weakne&s;s might &s;ug|ge&s;t) a far better.

Indeed, my Lord, I greatly deceive my&s;elf, if in this hard &s;ea&s;on I would give a peck of refu&s;e wheat for all that is called fame and honour in the world. This is the appetite but of a few.

They who &s;hould have been to me as po&s;terity are in the place of ance&s;tors. I owe to the deare&s;t relation (which ever mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t in memory) that act of piety, which he would have performed to me; I owe it to him to &s;hew that he was not de&s;cended, as the Duke of Bed|ford would have it, from an unworthy parent.</P>

His deeds will be drawn out with the re&s;t of the lumber of his evidence room, and burnt to the tune of <HI>&ccedil;a ira</HI> in the courts of Bedford (then Equality) Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Am I to blame, if I attempt to pay his Grace's ho&s;tile reproaches to me with a friendly admoni|tion to him&s;elf? Can I be blamed, for pointing out to him in what manner he is like to be affected, if the &s;ect of the cannibal philo&s;ophers of France &s;hould pro&s;elytize any con&s;iderable part of this people, and, by their joint pro&s;elytizing arms, &s;hould conquer that Government, to which his Grace does not &s;eem to me to give all the &s;upport his own &s;ecurity demands? Surely it is proper, that he, and that others like him, &s;hould know the true genius of this &s;ect; what their opinions are; what they have done: and to whom; and what, (if a progno&s;tick is to be formed from the di&s;po&s;itions and actions of men) it is certain they will do hereafter. He
<PB N="57" REF="61">
ought to know, that they have &s;worn a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the only engagement they ever will keep, to all in this country, who bear a re&s;emblance to them&s;elves, and who think as &s;uch, that <HI>The whole duty of man</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in de&s;truction. They are a mi&s;allied and di&s;paraged branch of the hou&s;e of Nimrod. They are the Duke of Bed|ford's natural hunters; and he is their natural game. Becau&s;e he is not very profoundly reflect|ing, he &s;leeps in profound &s;ecurity: they, on the contrary, are always vigilant, active, en|terprizing, and though far removed from any knowledge, which makes men e&s;timable or u&s;e|ful, in all the in&s;truments and re&s;ources of evil, their leaders are not meanly in&s;tructed, or in|&s;ufficiently furni&s;hed. In the French Revolu|tion every thing is new; and, from want of pre|paration to meet &s;o unlooked for an evil, every thing is dangerous. Never, before this time, was a &s;et of literary men, converted into a gang of robbers and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. Never before, did a den of bravoes and banditti, a&s;&s;ume the garb and tone of an academy of philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>Let me tell his Grace, that an union of &s;uch characters, mon&s;trous as it &s;eems, is not made for producing de&s;picable enemies. But if they are formidable as foes, as friends they are
<PB N="58" REF="62">
dreadful indeed. The men of property in France confiding in a force, which &s;eemed to be irre|&s;i&s;tible, becau&s;e it had never been tried, ne|glected to prepare for a conflict with their enemies at their own weapons. They were found in &s;uch a &s;ituation as the Mexicans were, when they were attacked by the dogs, the ca|valry, the iron, and the gunpowder of an hand|ful of bearded men, whom they did not know to exi&s;t in nature. This is a compari&s;on that &s;ome, I think, have made; and it is ju&s;t. In France they had their enemies within their hou&s;es. They were even in the bo&s;oms of many of them. But they had not &s;agacity to di&s;cern their &s;avage character. They &s;eemed tame, and even care&s;&s;ing. They had nothing but <HI>douce humanit&eacute;</HI> in their mouth. They could not bear the puni&s;hment of the milde&s;t laws on the greate&s;t criminals. The &s;lighte&s;t &s;everity of ju&s;tice made their fle&s;h creep. The very idea that war exi&s;ted in the world di&s;turbed their re|po&s;e. Military glory was no more, with them, than a &s;plendid infamy. Hardly would they hear of &s;elf defence, which they reduced within &s;uch bounds, as to leave it no defence at all. All this while they meditated the confi&s;cations and ma&s;&s;a|cres we have &s;een. Had any one told the&s;e un|fortunate Noblemen and Gentlemen, how, and
<PB N="59" REF="63">
by whom, the grand fabrick of the French mo|narchy under which they flouri&s;hed would be &s;ubverted, they would not have pitied him as a vi&s;ionary, but would have turned from him as what they call a <HI>mauvais plai&s;ant.</HI> Yet we have &s;een what has happened. The per&s;ons who have &s;uffered from the cannibal philo&s;ophy of France, are &s;o like the Duke of Bedford, that nothing but his Grace's probably not &s;peaking quite &s;o good French, could enable us to find out any difference. A great many of them had as pompous titles as he, and were of full as illu&s;trious a race: &s;ome few of them had fortunes as ample; &s;everal of them, without meaning the lea&s;t di&s;paragement to the Duke of Bedford, were as wi&s;e, and as virtuous, and as valiant, and as well educated, and as compleat in all the lineaments of men of honour as he is: And to all this they had added the powerful outguard of a military profe&s;&s;ion, which, in it's nature, renders men &s;omewhat more cautious than tho&s;e, who have nothing to attend to but the lazy enjoyment of undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions. But &s;ecurity was their ruin. They are da&s;hed to pieces in the &s;torm, and our &s;hores are covered with the wrecks. If they had been aware that &s;uch a thing might happen, &s;uch a thing never could have happened.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="64">I a&s;&s;ure his Grace, that if I &s;tate to him the de&s;igns of his enemies, in a manner which may appear to him ludicrous and impo&s;&s;ible, I tell him nothing that has not exactly hap|pened, point by point, but twenty-four mile from our own &s;hore. I a&s;&s;ure him that the Frenchified faction, more encouraged, than others are warned, by what has happened in France, look at him and his landed po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, as an object at once of curio&s;ity and rapacity. He is made for them in every part of their double character. As robbers, to them he is a noble booty: as &s;peculati&s;ts, he is a glorious &s;ubject for their experimental phi|lo&s;ophy. He affords matter for an exten&s;ive analy&s;is, in all the branches of their &s;cience, geometrical, phy&s;ical, civil and political. The&s;e philo&s;ophers are fanaticks; independent of any intere&s;t, which if it operated alone would make them much more tractable, they are carried with &s;uch an headlong rage towards every de&s;|perate trial, that they would &s;acrifice the whole human race to the &s;lighte&s;t of their experi|ments. I am better able to enter into the cha|racter of this de&s;cription of men than the noble Duke can be. I have lived long and variou&s;ly in the World. Without any con&s;iderable pre|ten&s;ions to literature in my&s;elf, I have a&s;pired
<PB N="61" REF="65">
to the love of letters. I have lived for a great many years in habitudes with tho&s;e who profe&s;|&s;ed them. I can form a tolerable e&s;timate of what is likely to happen from a character, chiefly dependent for fame and fortune, on knowledge and talent, as well in it's morbid and perverted &s;tate, as in that which is &s;ound and natural. Naturally men &s;o formed and fini&s;hed are the fir&s;t gifts of Providence to the World. But when they have once thrown off the fear of God, which was in all ages too often the ca&s;e, and the fear of man, which is now the ca&s;e, and when in that &s;tate they come to under&s;tand one another, and to act in corps, a more dreadful calamity cannot ari&s;e out of Hell to &s;courge mankind. Nothing can be conceived more hard than the heart of a thorough-bred meta|phy&s;ician. It comes nearer to the cold malig|nity of a wicked &s;pirit than to the frailty and pa&s;&s;ion of a man. It is like that of the prin|ciple of Evil him&s;elf, incorporeal, pure, un|mixed, dephlegmated, defecated evil. It is no ea&s;y operation to eradicate humanity from the human brea&s;t. What Shake&s;peare calls "the compunctious vi&s;itings of nature," will &s;ome|times knock at their hearts, and prote&s;t again&s;t their murderous &s;peculations. But they have a means of compounding with their nature.
<PB N="62" REF="66">
Their humanity is not di&s;&s;olved. They only give it a long prorogation. They are ready to declare, that they do not think two thou&s;and years too long a period for the good that they pur&s;ue. It is remarkable, that they never &s;ee any way to their projected good but by the road of &s;ome evil. Their imagination is not fatigued, with the contemplation of human &s;uffering thro' the wild wa&s;te of centuries added to centuries, of mi&s;ery and de&s;olation. Their humanity is at their horizon&mdash;and, like the horizon, it always flies before them. The geometricians, and the chymi&s;ts bring, the one from the dry bones of their diagrams, and the other from the &s;oot of their furnaces, di&s;po&s;itions that make them wor&s;e than indifferent about tho&s;e feelings and habitudes, which are the &s;upports of the moral world. Ambition is come upon them &s;uddenly; they are intoxicated with it, and it has rendered them fearle&s;s of the dan|ger, which may from thence ari&s;e to others or to them&s;elves. The&s;e philo&s;ophers, con|&s;ider men in their experiments, no more than they do mice in an air pump, or in a recipient of mephitick gas. Whatever his Grace may think of him&s;elf, they look upon him, and every thing that belongs to him, with no more regard than they do upon the whi&s;kers of that little long-tailed
<PB N="63" REF="67">
animal, that has been long the game of the grave, demure, in&s;idious, &s;pring-nailed, velvet-pawed, green-eyed philo&s;ophers, whether going upon two legs, or upon four.</P>
<P>His Grace's landed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are irre&s;i&s;tibly inviting to an <HI>agrarian</HI> experiment. They are a downright in&s;ult upon the Rights of Man. They are more exten&s;ive than the territory of many of the Grecian republicks; and they are without compari&s;on more fertile than mo&s;t of them. There are now republicks in Italy, in Germany and in Swi&s;&s;erland, which do not po&s;|&s;e&s;s any thing like &s;o fair and ample a domain. There is &s;cope for &s;even philo&s;ophers to proceed in their analytical experiments, upon Harington's &s;even different forms of republicks, in the acres of this one Duke. Hitherto they have been wholly unproductive to &s;peculation; fitted for nothing but to fatten bullocks, and to produce grain for beer, &s;till more to &s;tupify the dull Engli&s;h under&s;tanding. Abb&eacute; Sieyes has whole ne&s;ts of pigeon-holes full of con&s;titutions ready made, ticketed, &s;orted, and numbered; &s;uited to every &s;ea&s;on and every fancy; &s;ome with the top of the pattern at the bottom, and &s;ome with the bottom at the top; &s;ome plain, &s;ome flowered; &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed for their

Some where the electors choo&s;e the repre&s;enta|tives; others, where the repre&s;entatives choo&s;e the electors. Some in long coats, and &s;ome in &s;hort cloaks; &s;ome with pantaloons; &s;ome with|out breeches. Some with five &s;hilling qualifica|tions; &s;ome totally unqualified. So that no con|&s;titution-fancier may go un&s;uited from his &s;hop, provided he loves a pattern of pillage, oppre&s;&s;ion, arbitrary impri&s;onment, confi&s;cation, exile, revo|lutionary judgment, and legali&s;ed premeditated murder, in any &s;hapes into which they can be put. What a pity it is, that the progre&s;s of ex|perimental philo&s;ophy &s;hould be checked by his Grace's monopoly! Such are their &s;entiments, I a&s;&s;ure him; &s;uch is their language when they dare to &s;peak; and &s;uch are their proceedings, when they have the means to act.</P>
<P>Their geographers, and geometricians, have been &s;ome time out of practice. It is &s;ome time &s;ince they have divided their own country into &s;quares. That figure has lo&s;t the charms of it's

novelty. They want new lands for new trials. It is not only the geometricians of the repub|lick that find him a good &s;ubject, the chymi&s;ts have be&s;poke him after the geometricians have done with him. As the fir&s;t &s;et have an eye on his Grace's lands, the chymi&s;ts are not le&s;s taken with his buildings. They con&s;ider mor|tar as a very anti-revolutionary invention in it's pre&s;ent &s;tate; but properly employed, an ad|mirable material for overturning all e&s;tabli&s;h|ments. They have found that the gunpowder of <HI>ruins</HI> is far the fitte&s;t for making other <HI>ruins,</HI> and &s;o <HI>ad infinitum.</HI> They have calculated what quantity of matter convertible into nitre is to be found in Bedford Hou&s;e, in Woburn Abbey, and in what his Grace and his tru&s;tees have &s;till &s;uffered to &s;tand of that fooli&s;h royali&s;t Inigo Jones, in Covent Garden. Churches, play-hou&s;es, coffee-hou&s;es, all alike are de&s;tined to be mingled, and equalized, and blended into one common rubbi&s;h; and well &s;ifted, and lixi|viated, to chry&s;talize into true democratick ex|plo&s;ive in&s;urrectionary nitre.

of Bedford's hou&s;es, the Seieyes, and the re&s;t of the analytical legi&s;lators, and con&s;titution-venders, are quite as bu&s;y in their trade of decompo&s;ing organization, in forming his Grace's va&s;&s;als into primary a&s;&s;emblies, national guards, fir&s;t, &s;e|cond and third requi&s;itioners, committees of re&s;earch, conductors of the travelling guillotine, judges of revolutionary tribunals, legi&s;lative hangmen, &s;upervi&s;ors of domiciliary vi&s;itation, exactors of forced loans, and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the maximum.</P>
<P>The din of all this &s;mithery may &s;ome time or other po&s;&s;ibly wake this noble Duke, and pu&s;h him to an endeavour to &s;ave &s;ome little matter from their experimental philo&s;ophy. If he pleads his grants from the Crown, he is ruined at the out&s;et. If he pleads he has received them from the pillage of &s;uper&s;titious corporations, this indeed will &s;tagger them a little, becau&s;e they are enemies to all corporations, and to all religion. However, they will &s;oon recover them&s;elves, and will tell his Grace, or his learn|ed council, that all &s;uch property belongs to the <HI>nation</HI>; and that it would be more wi&s;e for him, if he wi&s;hes to live the natural term of a <HI>citizen,</HI> (that is, according to Condorcet's cal|culation, &s;ix months on an average,) not to pa&s;s

Deep Philo&s;ophers are no triflers; brave Sans culottes are no formali&s;ts. They will no more regard a Marquis of Tavi&s;tock than an Abbot of Tavi&s;tock; the Lord of Wooburn will not be more re&s;pectable in their eyes than the Prior of Wooburn: they will make no difference be|tween the Superior of a Covent Garden of nuns and of a Covent Garden of another de|&s;cription.

It was but the other day, that on putting in order &s;ome things which had been brought here on my taking leave of London for
<PB N="70" REF="74">
ever, I looked over a number of fine portraits, mo&s;t of them of per&s;ons now dead, but who&s;e &s;ociety, in my better days, made this a proud and happy place. Among&s;t the&s;e was the pic|ture of Lord Keppel. It was painted by an arti&s;t worthy of the &s;ubject, the excellent friend of that excellent man from their earlie&s;t youth, and a common friend of us both, with whom we lived for many years without a moment of coldne&s;s, of peevi&s;hne&s;s, of jealou&s;y, or of jar, to the day of our final &s;eparation.</P>
<P>I ever looked on Lord Keppel as one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t men of his age; and I loved, and cultivated him accordingly. He was much in my heart, and I believe I was in his to the very la&s;t beat. It was after his trial at Port&s;mouth that he gave me this picture. With what zeal and anxious affection I attended him through that his agony of glory, what part my &s;on in the early flu&s;h and enthu&s;ia&s;m of his virtue, and the pious pa&s;&s;ion with which he at|tached him&s;elf to all my connections, with what prodigality we both &s;quandered our&s;elves in courting almo&s;t every &s;ort of enmity for his &s;ake, I believe he felt, ju&s;t as I &s;hould have felt, &s;uch friend&s;hip on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. I par|took indeed of this honour, with &s;everal of the
<PB N="71" REF="75">
fir&s;t, and be&s;t, and able&s;t in the kingdom, but I was behind hand with none of them; and I am &s;ure, that if to the eternal di&s;grace of this nation, and to the total annihilation of every trace of honour and virtue in it, things had taken a different turn from what they did, I &s;hould have attended him to the quarter-deck with no le&s;s good will and more pride, though with far other feelings, than I partook of the ge|neral flow of national joy that attended the ju&s;|tice that was done to his virtue.</P>
<P>Pardon, my Lord, the feeble garrulity of age, which loves to diffu&s;e it&s;elf in di&s;cour&s;e of the departed great. At my years we live in retro|&s;pect alone: and, wholly unfitted for the &s;ociety of vigorous life, we enjoy, the be&s;t balm to all wounds, the con&s;olation of friend&s;hip, in tho&s;e only whom we have lo&s;t for ever. Feeling the lo&s;s of Lord Keppel at all times, at no time did I feel it &s;o much as on the fir&s;t day when I was attacked in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>Had he lived, that reverend form would have ri&s;en in its place, and with a mild, parental repre|hen&s;ion to his nephew the Duke of Bedford, he would have told him that the favour of that gracious prince, who had honoured his virtues
<PB N="72" REF="76">
with the government of the navy of Great Bri|tain, and with a &s;eat in the hereditary great council of his kingdom, was not unde&s;ervedly &s;hewn to the friend of the be&s;t portion of his life, and his faithful companion and coun&s;ellor under his rude&s;t trials. He would have told him, that to whomever el&s;e the&s;e reproaches might be becoming, they were not decorous in his near kindred. He would have told him that when men in that rank lo&s;e decorum, they lo&s;e every thing.</P>
<P>On that day I had a lo&s;s in Lord Keppel; but the publick lo&s;s of him in this aweful cri&s;is&mdash;! I &s;peak from much knowledge of the per&s;on, he never would have li&s;tened to any compromi&s;e with the rabble rout of this Sans Culotterie of France. His goodne&s;s of heart, his rea&s;on, his ta&s;te, his publick duty, his principles, his pre|judices, would have repelled him for ever from all connection with that horrid medley of mad|ne&s;s, vice, impiety, and crime.</P>
<P>Lord Keppel had two countries; one of de&s;cent, and one of birth. Their intere&s;ts and their glory are the &s;ame; and his mind was capacious of both. His family was no|ble and it was Dutch: that is, he was of
<PB N="73" REF="77">
the olde&s;t and pure&s;t nobility that Europe can boa&s;t, among a people renowned above all others for love of their native land. Though it was never &s;hewn in in&s;ult to any human be|ing, Lord Keppel was &s;omething high. It was a wild &s;tock of pride, on which the tendere&s;t of all hearts had grafted the milder virtues. He valued ancient nobility; and he was not di&s;in|clined to augment it with new honours. He valued the old nobility and the new, not as an excu&s;e for inglorious &s;loth, but as an incitement to virtuous activity. He con&s;idered it as a &s;ort of cure for &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and a narrow mind; con|ceiving that a man born in an elevated place, in him&s;elf was nothing, but every thing in what went before, and what was to come after him. Without much &s;peculation, but by the &s;ure in|&s;tinct of ingenuous feelings, and by the dictates of plain un&s;ophi&s;ticated natural under&s;tanding, he felt, that no great Commonwealth could by any po&s;&s;ibility long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without a body of &s;ome kind or other of nobility, decorated with honour, and fortified by privilege. This nobility forms the chain that connects the ages of a na|tion, which otherwi&s;e (with Mr. Paine) would &s;oon be taught that no one generation can bind another. He felt that no political fabrick could be well made without &s;ome &s;uch order of things
<PB N="74" REF="78">
as might, through a &s;eries of time afford a ra|tional hope of &s;ecuring unity, coherence, con|&s;i&s;tency, and &s;tability to the &s;tate. He felt that nothing el&s;e can protect it again&s;t the levity of courts, and the greater levity of the multitude. That to talk of hereditary monarchy without any thing el&s;e of hereditary reverence in the Com|monwealth, was a low-minded ab&s;urdity; fit only for tho&s;e dete&s;table "fools a&s;piring to be knaves," who began to forge in 1789, the fal&s;e money of the French Con&s;titution&mdash; That it is one fatal objection to all <HI>new</HI> fancied and <HI>new fabricated</HI> Republicks, (among a people, who, once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch an advantage, have wickedly and in&s;olently re|jected it,) that the <HI>prejudice</HI> of an old nobility is a thing that <HI>cannot</HI> be made. It may be improved, it may be corrected, it may be re|pleni&s;hed: men may be taken from it, or aggre|gated to it, but the <HI>thing it&s;elf</HI> is matter of <HI>inve|terate</HI> opinion, and therefore <HI>cannot</HI> be matter of mere po&s;itive in&s;titution. He felt, that this no|bility, in fact does not exi&s;t in wrong of other orders of the &s;tate, but by them, and for them.</P>
<P>I knew the man I &s;peak of; and, if we can divine the future, out of what we collect from the pa&s;t, no per&s;on living would look with more
<PB N="75" REF="79">
&s;corn and horrour on the impious parricide committed on all their ance&s;try, and on the de&s;perate attainder pa&s;&s;ed on all their po&s;te|rity, by the Orleans, and the Rochefoucaults, and the Fayettes, and the Vi&s;comtes de No|ailles, and the fal&s;e Perigords, and the long <HI>et caetera</HI> of the perfidious Sans Culottes of the court, who like demoniacks, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;pirit of fallen pride, and inverted ambition, ab|dicated their dignities, di&s;owned their families, betrayed the mo&s;t &s;acred of all tru&s;ts, and by breaking to pieces a great link of &s;ociety, and all the cramps and holdings of the &s;tate, brought eternal confu&s;ion and de&s;olation on their coun|try. For the fate of the mi&s;creant parricides them&s;elves he would have had no pity. Com|pa&s;&s;ion for the myriads of men, of whom the world was not worthy, who by their means have peri&s;hed in pri&s;ons, or on &s;caffolds, or are pin|ing in beggary and exile, would leave no room in his, or in any well-formed mind, for any &s;uch &s;en&s;ation. We are not made at once to pity the oppre&s;&s;or and the oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Looking to his Batavian de&s;cent, how could he bear to behold his kindred, the de&s;cendants of the brave nobility of Holland, who&s;e blood pro|digally poured out, had, more than all the ca|nals,
<PB N="76" REF="80">
meers, and inundations of their country, protected their independence, to behold them bowed in the ba&s;e&s;t &s;ervitude, to the ba&s;e&s;t and vile&s;t of the human race; in &s;ervitude to tho&s;e who in no re&s;pect, were &s;uperior in dignity, or could a&s;pire to a better place than that of hangmen to the tyrants, to who&s;e &s;ceptered pride they had oppo&s;ed an elevation of &s;oul, that &s;urmounted, and overpowered the loftine&s;s of Ca&s;tile, the haughtine&s;s of Au&s;tria, and the overbearing arrogance of France?</P>
<P>Could he with patience bear, that the chil|dren of that nobility, who would have deluged their country and given it to the &s;ea, rather than &s;ubmit to Louis XIV. who was then in his me|ridian glory, when his arms were conducted by the Turennes, by the Luxembourgs, by the Boufflers; when his councils were directed by the Colberts, and the Louvois; when his tribu|nals were filled by the Lamoignons and the Dague&s;&s;aus&mdash;that the&s;e &s;hould be given up to the cruel &s;port of the Pichegru's, the Jourdans, the Santerres, under the Rollands, and Bri&s;&s;ots, and Gor&s;as, and Robe&s;pierres, the Reubels, the Carnots, and Talliens, and Dantons, and the whole tribe of Regicides, robbers, and revolu|tionary judges, that, from the rotten carca&s;e of
<PB N="77" REF="81">
their own murdered country, have poured out innumerable &s;warms of the lowe&s;t, and at once the mo&s;t de&s;tructive of the cla&s;&s;es of animated nature, which like columns of locu&s;ts, have laid wa&s;te the faire&s;t part of the world?</P>
<P>Would Keppel have borne to &s;ee the ruin of the virtuous Patricians, that happy union of the noble and the burgher, who with &s;ignal prudence and integrity, had long governed the cities of the confederate Republick, the cheri&s;hing fathers of their country, who, denying commerce to them|&s;elves, made it flouri&s;h in a manner unexampled under their protection? Could Keppel have borne that a vile faction &s;hould totally de&s;troy this harmonious con&s;truction, in favour of a robbing Democracy, founded on the &s;purious rights of man?</P>
<P>He was no great clerk, but he was perfectly well ver&s;ed in the intere&s;ts of Europe, and he could not have heard with patience, that the country of Grotius, the cradle of the Law of Nations, and one of the riche&s;t repo&s;itories of all Law, &s;hould be taught a new code by the ignorant flippancy of Thomas Paine, the pre|&s;umptuous foppery of La Fayette, with his &s;tolen rights of man in his hand, the wild profligate
<PB N="78" REF="82">
intrigue and turbulency of Marat, and the impious &s;ophi&s;try of Condorcet, in his in&s;olent addre&s;&s;es to the Batavian Republick?</P>
<P>Could Keppel, who idolized the hou&s;e of Na&s;&s;au, who was him&s;elf given to England, along with the ble&s;&s;ings of the Briti&s;h and Dutch revolutions; with revolutions of &s;tability; with revolutions which con&s;olidated and married the liberties and the intere&s;ts of the two nations for ever, could he &s;ee the fountain of Briti&s;h liberty it&s;elf in &s;ervitude to France? Could he &s;ee with patience a Prince of Orange expelled as a &s;ort of diminutive de&s;pot, with every kind of contu|mely, from the country, which that family of de|liverers had &s;o often re&s;cued from &s;lavery, and obliged to live in exile in another country, which owes it's liberty to his hou&s;e?</P>
<P>Would Keppel have heard with patience, that the conduct to be held on &s;uch occa&s;ions was to become &s;hort by the knees to the faction of the homicides, to intreat them quietly to retire? or if the fortune of war &s;hould drive them from their fir&s;t wicked and unprovoked inva&s;ion, that no &s;ecurity &s;hould be taken, no arrangement made, no barrier formed, no alliance entered into for the &s;ecurity of that, which under a fo|reign

name is the mo&s;t precious part of Eng|land? What would he have &s;aid, if it was even propo&s;ed that the Au&s;trian Netherlands (which ought to be a barrier to Holland, and the tie of an alliance, to protect her again&s;t any &s;pecies of rule that might be erected, or even be re&s;tored in France) &s;hould be formed into a republick under her influence and dependent upon her power?</P>
<P>But above all, what would, he have &s;aid, if he had heard it made a matter of accu&s;ation again&s;t me, by his nephew the Duke of Bedford, that I was the author of the war? Had I a mind to keep that high di&s;tinction to my&s;elf, as from pride I might, but from ju&s;tice I dare not, he would have &s;natched his &s;hare of it from my hand, and held it with the gra&s;p of a dying convul&s;ion to his end.</P>
<P>It would be a mo&s;t arrogant pre&s;umption in me to a&s;&s;ume to my&s;elf the glory of what belongs to his Maje&s;ty, and to his Mini&s;ters, and to his Parliament, and to the far greater majority of his faithful people: But had I &s;tood alone to coun&s;el, and that all were determined to be guided by my advice, and to follow it impli|citly&mdash;then I &s;hould have been the &s;ole author of a war. But it &s;hould have been a war on
