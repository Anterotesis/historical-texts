<HEAD>THE LIFE OF THE Lady <HI>JANE GRAY, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU de&s;ired me to &s;end you the Life of the Lady <HI>Jane Gray.</HI> I do a&s;&s;ure you, my Friend, (and hope to be believ'd) that I &s;pent a whole Day in the &s;earch, and to as little purpo&s;e, as he that carry'd a lighted Torch at Noon-day, to look for an hone&s;t Man. But however, you &s;han't altogether lo&s;e your Longing: For you may, if you plea&s;e, read this following Account, Collected out of the be&s;t, and mo&s;t exacte&s;t, Hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>THis Incomparable Lady was Elde&s;t Daughter to <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> Duke of <HI>Suffolk.</HI> She was born in the Year 1534. She was Endow'd with all the Graces both of Mind and Body. She gave in her earlie&s;t Infancy, many Proofs of her growing Piety, and her Veneration for Holy Writ. For once being di|verting her&s;elf with her Companions, one had an occa&s;ion to have &s;omething that was above her reach, and taking a large Bible to tread on to get it; the young Lady &s;eeing her, wou'd not &s;uffer her, and expre&s;t her Re&s;entment: She was &s;o taken with it, that &s;he broke off their &s;port, and retir'd to her Clo&s;et, more than ordinary Melancholly.</P>
<P>She was a Lady indeed that &s;eem'd cut out by Heaven for Greatne&s;s. As She was a Beautiful and a Graceful Per&s;on, &s;o
<PB N="4" REF="3">
&s;he was Endow'd with all tho&s;e Virtues that are e&s;teem'd by Heaven, and all good Men, as is expre&s;s'd in the Tragedy of her, by the Poet.</P>
<Q><L>Candour with Goodne&s;s, Fortitude with Sweetne&s;s,</L>
<L>Strict Piety, and love of Truth, with Learning,</L>
<L>More than the Schools of <HI>Athens</HI> ever knew,</L>
<L>Or her own <HI>Plato</HI> taught&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>When &s;he came to years of more &s;olid Under&s;tanding, Dr. <HI>Elmer</HI> (afterwards Bi&s;hop of <HI>London)</HI> was her Tutor: And from him &s;he learn'd Latin and Greek, to a Perfection, and wou'd Di&s;cour&s;e in tho&s;e Language upon any Subject, and wou'd give her Sentiments to Admiration. Nay, &s;he delighted in &s;uch Conferences: For when others of her Sex and Age were taking their Diver&s;ion abroad, &s;he employ'd her time in Reading. The Lady <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Tutor <HI>(Roger A&s;cham)</HI> coming once to wait on her at her Father's Hou&s;e in the Country; was &s;urpriz'd to find her alone reading of <HI>Plato</HI>'s Works in Greek, while the re&s;t of the Family were diverting them&s;elves with Hunting, (in her Father's Park) and other Rural Diver&s;ions. He ask'd her how &s;he could lo&s;e the &s;hare of &s;uch Diver&s;ion: She an&s;wer'd, Tho&s;e were but faint Shadows of what &s;he en|joy'd in Contemplation there&mdash;<HI>[pointing to</HI> Plato's Phoedon <HI>that lay before her]</HI> And added &s;he, I e&s;teem it one of the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings of my Life, that I have had &s;evere Parents, and a Milder Ma&s;ter, which have made me delight with tho&s;e Companions, which were not like Mankind; for when I find my &s;elf weary, I can lay by their Company without commit|ing a Solieci&s;m again&s;t good Manners.</P>
<P>The young King was ever fond of her Company, and as their Ages were much the &s;ame, &s;o was their Fancies and De|&s;ires. As the Poet has it.</P>
<Q><L>From their fir&s;t early Days of Infant Life,</L>
<L>A gentle Band of Friend&s;hip grew betwixt 'em;</L>
<L>As Brother, and as Si&s;ter, bred together,</L>
<L>Beneath one Common Parents Care they liv'd.</L>
<L>In every Innocent Delight they &s;har'd,</L>
<L>They Sung, and Danc'd, and Sat, and Walk'd together:</L>
<L>She left the &s;hining Courts to &s;hare his Toil,</L>
<L>To turn with him the Grave Hi&s;torian's Page,</L>
<L>And ta&s;te the Rapture of the Poets Song.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
She was well read in Sacred, as well as Prophane Hi&s;tory, and had attain'd to a large Knowledge in Divinity: And at the Age when others were but ta&s;ting the Notions of Philo&s;ophy, &s;he had Capacity enough to make a full Fea&s;t. And with all the&s;e Advantages of Birth and Parts, &s;he was &s;o Humble, &s;o Meek, and Pious, that all People both Admir'd and Lov'd her. She had a Mind wonderfully rais'd above the World, and the Plea&s;ures of it &s;he call'd Vanities.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Guilford,</HI> Son to the A&s;piring Duke of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> by his Father's Politick means, was Marry'd to her on the Third of <HI>June</HI> 1553, and as well as I can make out in the Twentieth Year of her Age. She expre&s;t all the &s;orrow imaginable at the King's Death, and in his Sickne&s;s gave him mo&s;t con&s;tant Attendance, which is finely expre&s;t in the Poets Lines by <HI>Nor|thumberland</HI> on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<Q><L>All de&s;olate, and drown'd in flowing Tears,</L>
<L>By <HI>Edward</HI>'s Bed, the Pious Princes &s;its;</L>
<L>Fa&s;t from her lifted Eyes, the pearly Drops</L>
<L>Fall trickling o'er her Cheek, while &s;trong Devotion,</L>
<L>And fervent Zeal pour forth her lab'ring Soul,</L>
<L>And every &s;igh is wing'd with Prayers &s;o potent,</L>
<L>As &s;trive with Heaven to &s;ave her dying Lord.</L></Q>
<P>When her Father, the Duke of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> with the re&s;t of the Privy Council, came to attend, and hail her Queen, &s;he expre&s;t a great deal of Reluctancy, and was rather forc'd to take it, out of an Obedience to her Parents, than any de&s;ire of her own. She &s;aid the Crown, by Right of Inheritance, was to de&s;cend to the Si&s;ters of the late King, and that &s;he was un|willing to burden her Con&s;cience to enrich her&s;elf with the &s;poils of others. At la&s;t, for the Safety of the People, and the Main|taining and Pre&s;erving the Reformation, &s;he was won upon to accept the Crown. The Author of the Tragedy of Lady <HI>Jane,</HI> has expre&s;t her unwillingne&s;s in this manner.</P>
<Q><L>Take me, Crown me;</L>
<L>Inve&s;t me with this Royal Wretchedne&s;s:</L>
<L>Let me not know one happy Minute more,</L>
<L>Let all my &s;leeple&s;s Nights be &s;pent in Care,</L>
<L>My Days be vex'd with Tumults and Alarms,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="5">
If only I can &s;ave you; if my Fate</L>
<L>Has mark'd me out to be the Publick Victim,</L>
<L>I take the Lot with Joy.&mdash;Yes, I will Die</L>
<L>For that Eternal Truth my Faith is fix'd on,</L>
<L>And that dear Native Land which gave me Birth.</L>
<L>All that I ask, is, tho' my Fortune frown,</L>
<L>And bury me beneath this Fatal Crown;</L>
<L>Let this one good be added to my Doom,</L>
<L>To &s;ave this Land from Tyranny and <HI>Rome.</HI></L></Q>
<P>She was neither lifted up when &s;he wore the Crown, nor ca&s;t down, when her Palace became her Pri&s;on, but carry'd her&s;elf in an even Temper of Mind in tho&s;e great inequali|ties of Fortune, that &s;o &s;uddenly exalted, and depre&s;s'd her. All the Pa&s;&s;ion &s;he expre&s;t was, that her Father, Mother, and Hu&s;band were involv'd in her ill Fortune. When &s;he had no|tice that her Sentence of Death was pa&s;t, &s;he did not expre&s;s the lea&s;t concern, but bore it with a Con&s;tancy of Mind be|yond thought. The Queen &s;ent Dr. <HI>Fecknam</HI> Three Days before to prepare her for Death: He had a long Conver&s;ation with her, and an&s;wer'd to all his Que&s;tions, with that calmne&s;s of Mind, and clearne&s;s of Rea&s;on, that it was a Wonder to hear, how &s;o Young a Per&s;on of her Sex, cou'd look on Death &s;o nigh her with &s;o little concern. She &s;ent a Letter to her Fa|ther, to mitigate his Sorrow for her Unhappy End. She re|joyced at aproaching Death, and thought the nigher it appear'd it look'd le&s;s dreadful. She expre&s;t a great deal of tenderne&s;s, when &s;he &s;aw her Hu&s;band led out fir&s;t to Execution: He had de&s;ir'd to take leave of her before he dy'd, but &s;he declin'd it, &s;ince (&s;he &s;aid) it wou'd rather be an Addition to her Grief: And &s;he hop'd to meet &s;hortly, and be united in a much happier State. She &s;aw her Hu&s;band's Headle&s;s Trunk carry'd by her without any outward concern, or Woman's Wailings, and con|&s;ol'd her&s;elf in knowing &s;he &s;hou'd &s;oon follow him. When &s;he was brought to the Scaffold (which for fear of the People was built within the Tower) &s;he confe&s;t &s;he had Sin'd in taking the Crown when it was proffer'd her, but &s;he took it to a good end. She declar'd &s;he dy d a true Chri&s;tian in the reform'd Faith, but hoped to be &s;av'd only, thro the Merits and Suffe|rings of her Ble&s;&s;ed Lord and and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Then having de&s;ir'd the Peoples Prayers, &s;he repeated the 51&s;t <HI>P&s;am,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
when after &s;ome private Devotion, &s;he undre&s;s'd her&s;elf, put her Hankerchief her&s;elf upon her Eyes, then laying her Head upon the fatal Block, &s;he re&s;ign'd her Breath to him who gave it her.</P>
<P>Thus fell this Great, this Good, and Pious Lady, which &s;eem'd by Virtue to be form'd for Greatne&s;s, which may be as an Example to the World of the Mutability of Fortune: And I think our Poet has been very exact in his Characters in fol|lowing the truth of Hi&s;tory. Nothing can De&s;cribe the Haughty Ambitious <HI>Northumberland</HI> better than him&s;elf, in the following Lines, where he &s;eems to have laid the Scheme of his de&s;igns even before the King's Death.</P>
<Q><L>She mu&s;t be here, and lodg'd in <HI>Guilford</HI>'s Arms</L>
<L>E're <HI>Edward</HI> Dyes, or all we have done is Marr'd,</L>
<L>Ha! <HI>Pembroke!</HI> that's a Bar that thwarts my way;</L>
<L>His fiery Temper brooks not oppo&s;ition,</L>
<L>And mu&s;t be met with &s;oft and &s;ubtile Arts,</L>
<L>With crouching Courte&s;ie and Hony'd Words,</L>
<L>Such as A&s;&s;wage the fierce and bend the Strong.</L></Q>
<P>See <HI>Baker</HI>'s Chronicle, in giving an account of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> Marching with his Troops out of <HI>London.</HI> The 14th of <HI>July</HI> he March'd thro' <HI>Shoreditch</HI> with 2000 Hor&s;e and 6000 Foot, and tho' there were many Spectators in the Streets as he pa&s;s'd, none wi&s;h'd him Succe&s;s. Now judge how high the Poet comes, where he makes <HI>Pembroke</HI> a Spectator.</P>
<Q><L>I &s;aw him Marching at his Army's Head,</L>
<L>I mark'd him I&s;&s;uing thro' the City Gates;</L>
<L>And (for he wore his Beaver up) cou'd read</L>
<L>Upon his Vi&s;age Horror and Di&s;may.</L>
<L>No Voice of friendly Salutation cheer'd him,</L>
<L>None wi&s;h'd his Arms might thrive, or bad Heaven &s;peed him:</L>
<L>But thro' a Staring gha&s;tly looking Croud,</L>
<L>Unhail'd, Unble&s;t, with heavy Heart he went.</L></Q>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Northumberland</HI> went back to <HI>Cambridge</HI> to wait for more Succours from <HI>London;</HI> but hearing how Matters were carry'd, he di&s;mi&s;t his Troops, and went to the Market-place, only Accompanied with the Mayor, and him&s;elf, for want of a Herald, flung up his Cap (for Joy) and cry'd, God Save Queen
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<HI>Mary.</HI> But the Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> came with orders from the Queen to apprehend him, as one guilty of Trea&s;on, and brought him from <HI>Cambridge</HI> to the Tower on the 25th of <HI>July,</HI> and on the 22d of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1553 was Beheaded. This pa&s;&s;age is de|&s;crib'd by the Duke of <HI>Suffolk</HI> to his Daughter the Lady <HI>Jane.</HI></P>
<Q><L>With &s;ome &s;ew Followers he arriv'd at <HI>Cambridge,</HI></L>
<L>But there, even they for&s;ook him, and him&s;elf,</L>
<L>Was forc'd with heavy Heart, and watry Eye,</L>
<L>To ca&s;t his Cap up with di&s;&s;embled Chear,</L>
<L>And cry, God &s;ave Queen <HI>Mary:</HI> But ala&s;s!</L>
<L>Little avail'd the Semblance of that Loyalty;</L>
<L>For &s;oon thereafter by the Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI></L>
<L>With Trea&s;on was he charg'd, and there Arre&s;ted:</L>
<L>And now they bring him Pri&s;oner up to <HI>London.</HI></L></Q>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s in my Judgment there is a great many fine thoughts in this Play, but I leave 'em to yours; only I mu&s;t beg leave to point you out one, and &s;o conclude, for I reckon by this time you're as tir'd with Reading, as I with Writing.</P>
<P>It is in the Conclu&s;ion of the 4th Act, where <HI>Guilford</HI> is be|wailing the Lo&s;s of each other in Death: But &s;he endeavours to comfort him, by telling him they &s;hall meet again.</P>
<Q><L>Behold the Univer&s;al Works of Nature,</L>
<L>Where Life &s;till Springs from Death. To us the Sun</L>
<L>Dies every Night, and every Morn revives.</L>
<L>The Flow'rs, which Winter's Icy Head de&s;troy'd,</L>
<L>Lift their fair Heads, and live agen in Spring.</L>
<L>Mark with what Hopes upon the furrow'd Plain,</L>
<L>The Careful Ploughman ca&s;ts the pregnant Grain&punc;</L>
<L>There hid as in a Grave, a while it lies,</L>
<L>Till the revolving Sea&s;on bids it ri&s;e,</L>

<L>And potent call it from the teeming Earth;</L>
<L>Then large increa&s;e the buried Trea&s;ures yeild,</L>
<L>And with full Harve&s;t Crown the plenteous Field.</L></Q>
