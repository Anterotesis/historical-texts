Certainly Men le&s;s conver&s;ant in Publick Affairs, who have a Zeal for your Government, would be of more U&s;e and Service to you; Men who were per&s;ecuted by King <HI>Charles</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> either in their own Per&s;ons, or in the Per&s;ons of their Friends, who were fin'd, impri&s;on'd, and &s;ome of their Relations hang'd in tho&s;e Reigns, are more likely to act in earne&s;t again&s;t King <HI>James,</HI> and in the &s;upporting your Maje&s;ty and your Government, than tho&s;e who had their Fortunes and their Families rais'd by King <HI>James</HI> and his Brother King <HI>Charles,</HI> and who hope to be rais'd yet more by his Return, or at lea&s;t to &s;ecure in his Government what they have got in this, by obliging him and his Friends, at the Price of &s;acrificing you and your's.</P>
<P>For Example: Is it rea&s;onable to believe the E. of <HI>N.</HI> who&s;e Father and Family was rais'd by King <HI>Charles</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> for pro&s;tituting the Law (and his nau&s;eous Rhe|torick) to the De&s;igns of tho&s;e two Brothers, who him&s;elf was a Privy-Coun&s;ellor with Father <HI>Peters,</HI> and cho&s;en by King <HI>James</HI> at the time of the Revolution to treat with your Maje&s;ty at <HI>Hungerford,</HI> in order to delay your Progre&s;s to <HI>London</HI>; and la&s;tly, who &s;o violently oppos'd your Ma|je&s;ty's being crown'd King, as to lay an eternal Obligation upon King <HI>James</HI> by it: I &s;ay, Sir, is it rea&s;onable to be|lieve this Gentleman &s;o proper a Secretary of State to your Maje&s;ty, as the E. of <HI>S.</HI> who has &s;o mortally di&s;|oblig'd King <HI>James,</HI> in being &s;o early, and &s;o zealous in your Intere&s;ts, who went at the Head of that Me&s;&s;age to King <HI>James</HI> wherein he was requir'd to retire from <HI>White|hall</HI>; who has &s;ince that been &s;o in&s;trumental to place and

<P>Or can your Maje&s;ty think Mr. <HI>K.</HI> who (it is generally &s;aid) believes him&s;elf the Son of King <HI>J.</HI> and it is known by all the World, owes his Fortune to him; who (if we may believe Report) at the time of the Revolution, agreed with Captain <HI>To&s;yer,</HI> to carry the Ships he then commanded in the <HI>Straits</HI> to King <HI>James</HI> in <HI>France</HI> (had not the com|mon Sailors very rudely oppos'd the Project) who after this acquitted him&s;elf &s;o ill at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> in letting the <HI>Thoulon</HI> Squadron pa&s;s by him in his &s;ight, without fighting them; and to conclude, has made &s;o unaccountable a Campagn of it this Summer: Can your Maje&s;ty (give me leave to &s;ay, Sir) think this Gentleman (after all this) fitter to com|mand the Fleet of <HI>England,</HI> than Mr. <HI>R.</HI> who&s;e Provoca|tions to King <HI>James</HI> are never to be forgiven by him; who was one of the mo&s;t in&s;trumental Men in <HI>England</HI> in placing you upon the Throne; who la&s;t Year gave you the greate&s;t and mo&s;t glorious Victory that ever was obtain'd by us at Sea; and who&s;e Courage, Conduct and Fidelity the Par|liament of <HI>England</HI> has unanimou&s;ly atte&s;ted?</P>
<P>And now, Sir (if I may pre&s;ume &s;o far) will your Ma|je&s;ty be pleas'd to examine what Honour, what Profit has accru'd to you, or the Nation, by your employing the&s;e Gentlemen who have of late been at the Head of the Mini&s;try? For God's &s;ake, Sir, ca&s;t up the Account of the la&s;t four Years Management, and &s;ee what you have gain'd by changing Whigs for Torys. Have not your Af|fairs gone backward both at home and abroad? Have not Mi&s;managements been multiply'd? Have you not cool'd your Friends, and yet not gain'd your Enemies? Do not almo&s;t all the Tories you employ drink King <HI>James</HI>'s Health in your Wine, and &s;erve him in your Offices? Do they not ob&s;truct all Bu&s;ine&s;s which ought to be di&s;patch'd, and di&s;patch all Bu&s;ine&s;s which ought to be ob&s;tructed? brow|beat your Friends, and delay them in the mo&s;t ju&s;t Pre|tences, but comply with your Enemies in their mo&s;t un|rea&s;onable Demands; nay, connive at their Cabals and Con&s;piracies, and &s;natch them out of the Hands of Ju&s;tice, when the Law has &s;entenc'd them to Death for their Trea|&s;ons? Would not &s;uch Mini&s;ters and Friends as the&s;e be le&s;s dangerous to you, when profe&s;s'd Enemies, nay in Arms again&s;t you in the Field, than in your Council, Ca|binet and Offices? Undoubtedly they would.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">But I know the common An&s;wer to all the&s;e kind of Complaints is, That it is more ea&s;y to find Faults than Remedies. If you plea&s;e therefore, Sir, we will con&s;ider of Remedys, and I think there may be &s;ome found out both ea&s;y and certain, and they are the&s;e: Fir&s;t, Sir, be pleas'd to remove from your Per&s;on, Council and Offices of Tru&s;t, Men bred up and confirm'd in Principles de|&s;tructive to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government, and hateful to your People; and to di&s;countenance all State-Projecters, and Mountebank-Mini&s;ters, who make Wounds in the State to recommend their Bal&s;am: Throw out, Sir, the&s;e <HI>Achans</HI> to be &s;ton'd by the People, who will otherwi&s;e, I fear, prevent God's Favour to you; who bla&s;t your Succe&s;s a|broad, and rob you of the Affections of your Subjects at home, with their accur&s;ed thing, I mean that Tin&s;el Power with which the&s;e Mi&s;creants dazle the Eyes of Princes, and lead them out of the right way. God is di&s;|pleas'd with it: For uncontroulable and unaccountable Power is the Right and Attribute of God alone; and (as the Scripture tells us) <HI>He will not give his Glory unto another; nor &s;uffer tho&s;e to act like Gods, who are to die like Men.</HI> Your People al&s;o will be di&s;pleas'd with a De&s;potick Power; for the Kings of <HI>England</HI> are bound by Laws, by mutual Compacts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (as you your &s;elf, Sir, have &s;et forth mo&s;t unan&s;werably in your Declaration when you came over) and if the&s;e are broken, <HI>Engli&s;h-men,</HI> who believe them|&s;elves Subjects to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> (as by Law e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd) and not Slaves to any particular Per&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Otherwi&s;e King <HI>James</HI> would have a fairer Pretence, than I hope we &s;hall ever allow him.</NOTE>; they become impatient, angry, and at length perhaps unrea&s;onable. And whenever they &s;ee their King be&s;et with Mini&s;ters of Lawle&s;s Principles (tho&s;e whole&s;ale Merchants of Arbitrary Power) they grow mi&s;tru&s;tful and unea&s;y, and are apt in &s;uch Ca&s;es to &s;hut their Pur&s;es, and open their Mouths. And give me leave to &s;ay, Sir, had not the People been made apprehen&s;ive and jealous, by &s;eeing the&s;e Men in the Mini&s;try, who&s;e mi&s;|chievous Methods they were &s;o well acquainted with, and did &s;o much abhor; no general Exci&s;e, no Loans, no Powers would have been thought by the People of <HI>England,</HI> too much to have intru&s;ted you with; &s;o highly they e&s;teem'd your generous Relief of them, your unequal Courage, and the many other admirable Vertues they &s;aw &s;hine in you. An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> King is the greate&s;t Monarch upon Earth, when he reigns in the Hearts of his Subjects; and all other Methods to Power and Greatne&s;s have been found ineffectual in <HI>England,</HI> I remember I once &s;aw

<P>In the next place, di&s;charge all Jacobites and Trimmer from Offices of Tru&s;t: For &s;uch as either de&s;ire King <HI>James,</HI> or from their Fear, or Wi&s;dom, endeavour to de|&s;erve from him (&s;o much as their Pardon) I humbly con|ceive are unfit for your Service at this Juncture; tho when the Government is more &s;ettl'd, I am for entertain|ing all who give Proofs of their Penitence for their pa&s;t Actions and Opinions.</P>
<P>But, Sir, Purgatives will not alone perfect the Cure of your Government, and re&s;tore it to perfect Health; you mu&s;t make u&s;e of Alteratives too, there mu&s;t be a Change of Mea&s;ures, as well as a Di&s;charge of Men: And the Method I would humbly offer is this.</P>

If the Peo|ple of <HI>England</HI> think you have a favourable Opinion of them, they will endeavour to de&s;erve it; if not, they may perhaps de&s;erve your wor&s;t Opinion too. This Humour of the Nation Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> found early, and apply'd her &s;elf &s;o happily to it, as by this &s;ingle Point to ma&s;ter all her Difficulties (the greate&s;t it may be that ever Prince had to &s;truggle with) whereas her Succe&s;&s;ors, by contrary Mea&s;ures, brought them&s;elves into very unfortunate Cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>In the next place, Sir, let me de&s;ire you to avoid con|cerning your &s;elf in Elections of Members in Parliament, or influencing them when cho&s;en: the Parliament is a &s;acred part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, and like the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> Ark of old, is not to be touch'd profanely, but with great Danger to tho&s;e who touch it &s;o.
