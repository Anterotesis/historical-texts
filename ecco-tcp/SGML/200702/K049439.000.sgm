<HEAD><HI>Dyers</HI> News Examined as to His <HI>Sweddi&s;h</HI> Memorial against the <HI>Review.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAD not the Town been allarm'd with my Name in Print, and all my Friends &s;urpris'd with a pro&s;pect of &s;omething Fatal at|tending it; I had not for a long time appeared in Print again in this part of <HI>Britain,</HI>&mdash;But I can not be &s;o far wanting to the de&s;ires of tho&s;e whom this has amu&s;ed, as to forbear giving the World &s;ome Account of it.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;ent down it &s;eems in <HI>Dyers</HI> News from <HI>London,</HI> that the <HI>Sweddi&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador <HI>Mon&s;ieur Liencroon</HI> has delivered in a Memorial to this Court, complaining of the <HI>Review,</HI> as Reflecting on the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and de|mands Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Gentlemen, I a&s;&s;ure you I know nothing of this my &s;elf, neither from my Friends in <HI>England,</HI> nor from the Government, neither do I be|lieve one Word of it. I have immediately on Notice of this Written to <HI>England,</HI> and de&s;ir'd &s;ome of my Friends to wait on the Secretaries of State to acquaint them where I am, and that if it be required, I will on the fir&s;t Notice take Po&s;t for <HI>London,</HI> and put my &s;elf into their Hands, to An&s;wer any thing the Law &s;hall require.</P>
<P>In the next place, I have Revi&s;ed what I have Writ of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and I profe&s;s I can &s;ee nothing in it in the lea&s;t, that is or ought to be an Affront to His <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, I thank GOD, I Live in a Land where the Liberty of the Subject is &s;uch, that &s;hould all this be true, I can receive no Hurt but by Law.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> indeed has carried it with &s;o high a Hand in &s;ome parts of the World, that their Princes deliver up their Subjects bound Hand and Foot for him to u&s;e his Plea&s;ure with them.&mdash;But GOD be Prai&s;ed, the Queen of <HI>England</HI> is none of tho&s;e: The Liberty of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men is in a better Ca&s;e, and no Man can be Puni&s;hed in <HI>England</HI> at the will of the Prince, much le&s;s at the will of a Forreign Prince.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> even the Soveraign can not puni&s;h but by Law, the Subject mu&s;t have a fair Tryal, and a Jury of his Equals mu&s;t Determine the Fact: If the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;hould demand the delivering up the meane&s;t Subject the Queen has, even a meaner, <HI>if &s;uch can be,</HI> than the Author of the <HI>Review,</HI> Her Maje&s;ty would immediately Reply, That it is not in Her Power to deliver any of Her Subjects up, or to puni&s;h them any farther
<PB N="2" REF="2">
than as the Law directs: And that the meane&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;picable Subject in <HI>England</HI> may even &s;ay to his Soveraign, <HI>That he will not be delivered up.</HI></P>
<P>Nor do I believe the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> can think he has an Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> to deal with in the Queen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and that he can de|mand a Count <HI>Zobor</HI> of Her Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>I am content to be an&s;werable to the Law, if I have offended him or any Body el&s;e; and it is no Arrogancy to &s;ay I am a Subject of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and of no other Mortal Power in the World.</P>
<P>This is to be a Subject to GOD and the Queen, for an Obedience to the Law is all the Subjection, <HI>&s;peaking of Humane Affairs,</HI> that either GOD or the Queen requires.</P>
<P>But what is it you &s;aid of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> &s;ays the Enquirers, you mu&s;t have &s;aid &s;ome ill thing of him, or el&s;e he would not have Complain|ed of your Paper by his Amba&s;&s;ador?</P>
<P>Truly, Gentlemen, I'll tell you as near as I can what I &s;aid of him&mdash;and if I tell it again, you will &s;ay, 'Tis a &s;ign I have not much fear upon me of his Re&s;entment.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;aid, That the <HI>Swede</HI> lying in <HI>Saxony</HI> all this Summer with 50000 Men about him, and doing nothing, while he &s;uffered his new King of <HI>Poland</HI> to be ruin'd, and the Countrey to be ravaged by the <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> &s;ignified that he had &s;ome &s;ecret de&s;ign in his Head, &s;ome project on Foot, which no Body knew of but him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;aid, If he had no De&s;ign, no Meaning, no Pro&s;pect, and yet lay &s;till there, while his Subjects and his Allies were ruined by his Enemies, he was the mo&s;t Impolitick, Nothing-doing Prince in the World.</P>
<P N="3">3. I &s;aid, That for a Prince to neglect the Defence of his own Subjects, and leave them Expo&s;ed to the Inva&s;ion of Cruel and Barbarous Neighbours, when he is at the &s;ame time pu&s;hing on the Conque&s;ts and Triumphs of Victory again&s;t their Neighbours, is all one with a Father who neglects to provide for his Family, of whom the Text &s;ays, he is wor&s;e than an Infidel.</P>
<P N="4">4. I &s;aid, That if the <HI>Swede</HI> &s;hould fall on the Emperor, and thereby oblige him to quitt the Confederacy, <HI>and make a &s;eparate Peace with France,</HI> we &s;hould have but little Cau&s;e to thank him for his Care of the Prote&s;tant Religion.</P>
<P N="5">5. I &s;aid, That if the <HI>Swede</HI> &s;hould fall upon the Emperor, and oblige him to draw all his Troops from <HI>Hungaria, Naples, Provence</HI> and the <HI>Rhine,</HI> he would be beaten, and not be able to &s;tand before him.</P>
<P>The&s;e and &s;uch as the&s;e is the utmo&s;t of the Matter, and if the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador has made a Complaint of this, I &s;hall always be ready to An&s;wer it.</P>
<P>If I had really &s;aid any thing which was Unbecoming me of the
<PB N="3" REF="3">
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> or any Body el&s;e, I &s;hould be willing to acknowledge it, and make Satisfaction; But as what I have &s;aid are both known and u&s;eful Truths, with a great deal of Calmne&s;s and Satisfaction I &s;ay I am ready to An&s;wer him or any Man el&s;e, as far as the Liberty and Laws of <HI>Britain</HI> require, and &s;o much for the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>'Tis a Happy thing, Gentlemen, to live under the laws of <HI>England,</HI> I hope you are advancing apace to the &s;ame Liberty, you may be a&s;&s;ured no <HI>Nation</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> enjoys the like Privileges, and I hope you will all partake of them, and learn to value them.</P>
<P>No Re&s;entment of Forreign Princes can affect us, no Threatnings terrifie us, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man is born a free man, no Power can in&s;ult him, no Supe|rior Oppre&s;s him; The Law only is his Governour, no Magi&s;trate, no Coun&s;ellor, no Authority, no not the Sovereign has the lea&s;t illegal Power over him, he can have no Sentence pronounced again&s;t him, no pu|ni&s;hment inflicted, no Fine levied, no not by the Queen Her Self, but according to Law.</P>
<P>This is the Confidence, the Peace and the Glory of this I&s;land, and no Forreign Power can interpo&s;e in it; If the greate&s;t King or Emperor in the World demands of the Queen of <HI>Britain</HI> the delivering up any one of Her Subjects to them, they may lawfully refu&s;e to go,&mdash;if the Sovereign puts a Man in Pri&s;on by His Royal Authority,&mdash;the Man &s;erves the Judge with a Writ of <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> and he will let him out again, even Her Maje&s;ty her &s;elf, <HI>asking Pardon for the Expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> cannot detain him.</P>
<P>He that will abandon this Liberty is not a Fool only but a Knave, a Knave to him&s;elf, and to his Family, a Knave to his Po&s;terity, and a Knave to the Con&s;titution of the Nation, for he gives up the Right of a Subject, and leaves an Example of wilful Bondage to his Countreymen.</P>
<P>If there be any &s;uch, I have only to &s;ay, I am &s;ure, I am not the Man: <HI>Britains</HI> Gentlemen are none of the Tribe of <HI>I&s;&s;achar,</HI> who&s;e Coat of Arms is an A&s;s couchant; what Burden the Law puts upon us, we freely &s;ubmit to, and never complain either of the Law or of the Sovereign.</P>
<P>But we always Kick at Oppre&s;&s;ion, and Re&s;i&s;t Tyrrany, and it has hither|to, GOD be prai&s;ed, been found in vain to En&s;lave us.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty, the be&s;t Queen that ever Governed us, has made it Her Glory to Reign over a Free People, the Queen de&s;pi&s;es Tyrrany as infinitely below Her; It's Her Plea&s;ure to &s;ee the Laws Triumph, 'tis Her Glory to &s;ee Ju&s;tice Uninterrupted, and 'tis Her Maje&s;ties peculiar Ble&s;&s;ing that there are none of Her People complaining of Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Attempts enough have been made to &s;urpri&s;e the Government into Tyr|rany, but both the Attempts and their Authors have found their <HI>Quietus</HI> in Her Maje&s;ties Ju&s;tice, and in Her Native Aver&s;ion to Cruelty and Ar|bitrary Power.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">
'Tis from hence, with &s;atisfaction, any Subject may &s;ay, and I &s;ay it with a &s;ecret Joy, that I can not expre&s;s, the Innocent Man may fly with Safety to the Law, if he has not Offended, he is &s;ure he &s;hall not be Op|pre&s;t, if he has, he is &s;ure to find Ju&s;tice always mingled with the Princes Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Let none of my Friends be afraid for me, if I have broke the Law, they ought to abandon me to the Law, and I ask no Favour; If I have not, no King, no Power, no Threatning, no not all the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> can make Her Maje&s;ty break in upon Her Peoples Liberties, or Deviat from Ju&s;tice, in the Satisfaction of which all Her Subjects are ea&s;ie and &s;afe, and I among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Dyer's</HI> Letter, he was always Careful that it &s;hould not be &s;een in <HI>London,</HI> whether for Shame or Fear is not Material, and from thence he often takes the Liberty to Forge Stories that have not the lea&s;t ground of Truth in them, and this is not the fir&s;t time he has done &s;o by me in particu|lar, which Forgeries he &s;preads in the Countrey, and the Letter not being to be had in the City, he is not &s;o ea&s;ily contradicted.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;ay, however, <HI>Dyer,</HI> the News Writer, ought to have been the la&s;t Man in the World to have &s;aid this in his Paper, &s;ince Mon&s;ieur <HI>Liencroon</HI> never took notice what he wrote in his publick Paper, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Duke of <HI>Marlborrow</HI> obtained his de&s;ire of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> by Bribing Count <HI>Piper.</HI></P>
