<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A SELECTION of the Beauties of <HI>Sterne</HI> is what has been looked for by a number of his admirers for &s;ome time; well knowing they would form &s;uch a Volume as perhaps this, nor any other language, could equal. Indeed it was highly nece&s;&s;ary on a particular &s;core to make this &s;election: the <HI>cha&s;te</HI> lovers of litera|ture were not only deprived them&s;elves of the plea&s;ure and in&s;truction &s;o con&s;picuous in this magnificent a&s;&s;emblage of Genius, but their ri&s;ing offspring, who&s;e minds it would poli&s;h to the highe&s;t perfection were prevented from ta&s;ting the enjoyment likewi&s;e. The <HI>cha&s;te</HI> part of the world complained &s;o loudly of the ob&s;cenity which taints the writings of <HI>Sterne,</HI> (and, in|deed, with &s;ome rea&s;on), that tho&s;e readers un|der their immediate in&s;pection were not &s;uffered to penetrate beyond the title-page of his <HI>Tri&s;tram Shandy;</HI>&mdash;his <HI>Sentimental Journey,</HI> in &s;ome de|gree, e&s;caped the general cen&s;ure; though that is not entirely free of the fault complained of.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="5">
To accommodate tho&s;e who are &s;trangers to the fir&s;t of the&s;e works, I have, (I hope with &s;ome degree of judgment), extracted the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed pa&s;&s;ages on which the &s;un of Genius &s;hines &s;o re&s;plendent, that all his competitors, in his manner of writing, are lo&s;t in an eclip&s;e of affectation and unnatural rhap&s;ody. I intended to have arranged them alphabetically, till I found the &s;tories of <HI>Le Fever,</HI> the <HI>Monk,</HI> and <HI>Maria,</HI> would be too clo&s;ely connected for the <HI>feeling reader,</HI> and would wound the bo&s;om of <HI>&s;en&s;ibility</HI> too deeply: I therefore placed them at a proper di&s;tance from each other.&mdash;I need not explain my motive for introducing the Sermon on the abu&s;es of Con&s;cience, with the effu&s;ions of hu|manity throughout it; every parent and gover|nor, I believe, (unle&s;s a bigotted Papi&s;t), will thank me.&mdash;I wi&s;h I could in&s;u&s;e the plea&s;ure that attended me in compiling this little work, into the brea&s;t of the reader, yet unacquainted with <HI>Sterne</HI>&mdash;as it is, I promi&s;e him, the hours he may devote to this great ma&s;ter of nature and the pa&s;&s;ions, will be marked with more fe|licity, than any, &s;ince genius led him to the love of letters.</P>
<P>The Author's opinion of many parts of the <HI>&s;acred writings</HI> may with truth be applied to
<PB N="9" REF="6">
a great part of his own, that there is to be found in them, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sublime and noble pa&s;&s;ages, which, by the rules of &s;ound critici&s;m and rea&s;on, may be demon&s;trated to be truly elo|quent and beautiful."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There is &s;omething in them &s;o thoroughly affecting, and &s;o noble and &s;ublime withal, that one might challenge the writings of the mo&s;t celebrated orators of antiquity to pro|duce any thing like them."</Q></P>
<P>Before I conclude, I cannot help ob&s;erving with an excellent writer, that, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"there are minds upon which the rays of fancy may be pointed without effect, and which no fire of &s;entiment can agitate, or exalt."</Q>&mdash;May &s;uch minds never violate the <HI>Beanties of Sterne;</HI> but let them be, while the virtues find &s;anctuary in the hearts of the amiable&mdash;their amu&s;ement only.</P>

<P>YOU &s;ee 'tis high time, &s;aid my father, addre&s;&s;|ing him&s;elf equally to my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> and <HI>Yorick,</HI> to take this young creature out of the&s;e womens' hands, and put him into tho&s;e of a private governor.</P>
<P>Now as I con&s;ider the per&s;on who is to be about my &s;on, as the mirror in which he is to view him&s;elf from morning to night, and by which he is to adju&s;t his looks, his carriage, and perhaps the inmo&s;t &s;entiments of his heart;&mdash;I would have one, <HI>Yorick,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, poli&s;hed at all points, fit for my child to look into.</P>
<P>There is, continued my father, a certain mien and motion of the body and all its parts, both in acting and &s;peaking, which argues a man <HI>well</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="14">
<HI>within.</HI> There are a thou&s;and unnoticed openings, continued my father, which let a penetrating eye at once into a man's &s;oul; and I maintain it, add|ed he, that a man of &s;en&s;e does not lay down his hat in coming into a room,&mdash;or take it up in go|ing out of it, but &s;omething e&s;capes, which di&s;co|vers him.</P>
<P>I will have him, continued my father, cheerful, facet&eacute;, jovial; at the &s;ame time, prudent, atten|tive to bu&s;ine&s;s, vigilant, acute, argute, inventive, quick in re&s;olving doubts and &s;peculative que&s;tions;&mdash;he &s;hall be wi&s;e and judicious, and learned:&mdash;And why not humble, and moderate, and gentle tempered, and good? &s;aid <HI>Yorick;</HI>&mdash;And why not, cried my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> free, and generous, and bountiful, and brave?&mdash;He &s;hall, my dear <HI>Toby,</HI> replied my father, getting up and &s;haking him by his hand.&mdash;Then, brother <HI>Shandy,</HI> an&s;wered my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> rai&s;ing him&s;elf off the chair, and lay|ing down his pipe to take hold of my father's other hand,&mdash;I humbly beg I may recommend poor <HI>Le Fever</HI>'s &s;on to you;&mdash;a tear of joy of the fir&s;t water &s;parkled in my uncle <HI>Toby's</HI> eye,&mdash;and another, the fellow to it, in the Coporal's, as the propo&s;ition was made;&mdash;you will &s;ee why when you read <HI>Le Fever's</HI> &s;tory.</P>

<HEAD>THE STORY OF LE FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>IT was &s;ome time in the &s;ummer of that year in which <HI>Dendermond</HI> was taken by the allies; when my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> was one evening getting his &s;upper, with <HI>Trim</HI> &s;itting behind him at a &s;mall &s;ideboard,&mdash;I &s;ay &s;itting&mdash;for in con&s;ideration of the Corporal's lame knee (which &s;ometimes gave him exqui&s;ite pain)&mdash;when my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> dined or &s;upped alone he would never &s;uffer the Corporal to &s;tand; and the poor fellow's veneration for his ma&s;ter was &s;uch, that with a proper artillery, my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> could have taken <HI>Dendermond</HI> it&s;elf, with le&s;s trouble than he was able to gain this point over him; for many a time when my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed the Corporal's leg was at re&s;t, he would look back, and detect him &s;tanding behind him with the mo&s;t dutiful re&s;pect: this bred more little &s;quabbles betwixt them, than all other cau&s;es for five-and-twenty years together&mdash;But this is neither here nor there&mdash;why do I mention it?&mdash;A&s;k my pen,&mdash;it governs me,&mdash;I govern not it.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="16">
He was one evening &s;itting thus at his &s;upper, when the landlord of a little inn in the village came into the parlour with an empty phial in his hand, to beg a gla&s;s or two of &s;ack; 'Tis for a poor gen|tleman,&mdash;I think of the army, &s;aid the landlord, who has been taken ill at my hou&s;e four days ago, and has never held up his head &s;ince, or had a de|&s;ire to ta&s;te any thing, till ju&s;t now, that he has a fancy for a gla&s;s of &s;ack and a thin toa&s;t,&mdash;"<HI>I think,</HI>" &s;ays he, taking his hand from his forehead, "<HI>it would comfort me.</HI>"&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;If I could neither beg, borrow, or buy &s;uch a thing,&mdash;added the landlord,&mdash;I would almo&s;t &s;teal it for the poor gentleman, he is &s;o ill.&mdash;I hope in God he will &s;till mend, continued he,&mdash;we are all of us concerned for him.</P>
<P>Thou art a good-natured &s;oul, I will an&s;wer for thee, cried my uncle <HI>Toby;</HI> and thou &s;halt drink the poor gentleman's health in a gla&s;s of &s;ack thy&s;elf,&mdash;and take a couple of bottles with my &s;ervice, and tell him he is heartily welcome to them, and to a dozen more if they will do him good.</P>
<P>Though I am per&s;uaded, &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> as the landlord &s;hut the door, he is a very compa&s;|&s;ionate fellow&mdash;<HI>Trim,</HI>&mdash;yet I cannot help enter|taining
<PB N="5" REF="17">
a high opinion of his gue&s;t too; there mu&s;t be &s;omething more than common in him, that in &s;o &s;hort a time &s;hould win &s;o much upon the affections of his ho&s;t;&mdash;And of his whole family, added the Corporal, for they are all concerned for him.&mdash;Step after him, &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI>&mdash;do <HI>Trim,</HI>&mdash;and a&s;k if he knows his name.</P>
<P>&mdash;I have quite forgot it, truly, &s;aid the landlord, coming back into the parlour with the Corporal,&mdash;but I can a&s;k his &s;on again:&mdash;Has he a &s;on with him then? &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby.</HI>&mdash;A boy, replied the landlord, of about eleven or twelve years of age;&mdash;but the poor creature has ta&s;ted almo&s;t as little as his father; he does nothing but mourn and lament for him night and day:&mdash;He has not &s;tir|red from the bed&s;ide the&s;e two days.</P>
<P>My uncle <HI>Toby</HI> laid down his knife and fork, and thru&s;t his plate from before him, as the land|lord gave him the account; and <HI>Trim,</HI> without being ordered, took away, without &s;aying one word, and in a few minutes after brought him his pipe and tobacco.</P>
<P><HI>Trim!</HI> &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> I have a project in my head, as it is a bad night, of wrapping my&s;elf
<PB N="6" REF="18">
up warm in my roquelaure, and paying a vi&s;it to this poor gentleman.&mdash;Your honour's roquelaure, replied the Corporal, has not once been had on, &s;ince the night before your honour received your wound, when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI>&mdash;and be&s;ides, it is &s;o cold and rainy a night, that what with the roque|laure, and what with the weather, it will be enough to give your honour your death, and bring on your honour's torment in your groin. I fear &s;o, replied my uncle <HI>Toby;</HI> but I am not at re&s;t in my mind, <HI>Trim,</HI> &s;ince the account the landlord has given me.&mdash;I wi&s;h I had not known &s;o much of this affair,&mdash;added my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI>&mdash;or that I had known more of it:&mdash;How &s;hall we manage it? Leave it, an't plea&s;e your honour, to me, quoth the Corporal;&mdash;I'll take my hat and &s;tick and go to the hou&s;e and reconnoitre, and act accordingly; and I will bring your honour a full account in an hour.&mdash;Thou &s;halt go, <HI>Trim,</HI> &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> and here's a &s;hilling &s;or thee to drink with his &s;ervant.&mdash;I &s;hall get it all out of him &s;aid the Corporal, &s;hutting the door.</P>
<P>It was not till my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> had knocked the a&s;hes out of his third pipe, that Corporal <HI>Trim</HI> re|turned from the inn, and gave him the following account.</P>

I de&s;paired, at fir&s;t, &s;aid the Corporal, of being able to bring back your honour any kind of intelli|gence concerning the poor &s;ick Lieutenant&mdash;Is he in the army, then? &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>&mdash;He is: &s;aid the Corporal&mdash;And in what regiment? &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>&mdash;I'll tell your honour, replied the Corporal, every thing &s;traight forwards, as I learnt it.&mdash;Then, <HI>Trim,</HI> I will fill another pipe, &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> and not interrupt thee till thou ha&s;t done; &s;o &s;it down at thy ea&s;e, <HI>Trim,</HI> in the win|dow-&s;eat, and begin thy &s;tory again.

<P>I de&s;paired at fir&s;t, &s;aid the Corporal, of being able to bring back any intelligence to your honour, about the Lieutenant and his &s;on; for when I a&s;ked where his &s;ervant was, from whom I made my&s;elf &s;ure of knowing every thing which was proper to be a&s;ked,&mdash;That's a right di&s;tinction, <HI>Trim,</HI> &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>&mdash;I was an&s;wered, an' plea&s;e your honour, that he had no &s;ervant with him;&mdash;that he had come to the inn with hired hor&s;es, which, upon finding him&s;elf unable to proceed, (to join, I

<P>I was hearing this account, continued the Cor|poral, when the youth came into the kitchen, to order the thin toa&s;t the landlord &s;poke of;&mdash;but I will do it for my father my&s;elf, &s;aid the youth.&mdash;Pray let me &s;ave you the trouble, young gentle|man, &s;aid I, taking up a fork for the purpo&s;e, and offering him my chair to &s;it down upon by the fire, whil&s;t I did it.&mdash;I believe, Sir, &s;aid he, very mode&s;tly, I can plea&s;e him be&s;t my&s;elf.&mdash;I am &s;ure, &s;aid I, his honour will not like the toa&s;t the wor&s;e for being toa&s;ted by an old &s;oldier.&mdash;The youth took hold of my hand, and in&s;tantly bur&s;t into tears.&mdash;Poor youth! &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI>&mdash;he has been bred up from an infant in the army, and the name of a &s;oldier, <HI>Trim,</HI> &s;ounded in his ears like the name of a friend;&mdash;I wi&s;h I had him here.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="21">
&mdash;I never in the longe&s;t march, &s;aid the Cor|poral, had &s;o great a mind to my dinner, as I had to cry with him for company:&mdash;What could be the matter with me, an' plea&s;e your honour? Nothing in the world, <HI>Trim,</HI> &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> blowing his no&s;e,&mdash;but that thou art a good na|tured fellow.</P>
<P>When I gave him the toa&s;t, Continued the Cor|poral, I thought it was proper to tell him I was Captain <HI>Shandy's</HI> &s;ervant, and that your honour (though a &s;tranger) was extremely concerned for his father;&mdash;and that if there was any thing in your hou&s;e or cellar&mdash;(And thou might'&s;t have added my pur&s;e too, &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby</HI>&mdash;he was heartily welcome to it:&mdash;He made a very low bow, (which was meant to your honour), but no an&s;wer,&mdash;for his heart was full&mdash;&s;o he went up &s;tairs with the toa&s;t;&mdash;I warrant you, my dear, &s;aid I, as I opened the kitchen-door, your father will be well again.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Yorick's</HI> curate was &s;moaking a pipe by the kitchen fire,&mdash;but &s;aid not a word good or bad to com&s;ort the youth.&mdash;I thought it wrong; added the Corporal&mdash;I think &s;o too, &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby.</HI></P>

down into the kitchen, to let me know, that in about ten minutes he &s;hould be glad if I would &s;tep up &s;tairs.&mdash;I believe, &s;aid the landlord, he is going to &s;ay his prayers,&mdash;for there was a book laid upon the chair by his bed-&s;ide, and as I &s;hut the door, I &s;aw his &s;on take up a cu&s;hion.&mdash;</P>
<P>I thought, &s;aid the curate, that you gentlemen of the army, Mr. <HI>Trim,</HI> never &s;aid your prayers at all.&mdash;I heard the poor gentleman &s;ay his prayers la&s;t night, &s;aid the landlady, very devoutly, and with my own ears, or I could not have believed it.&mdash;Are you &s;ure of it, replied the curate.&mdash;A &s;oldier, an' plea&s;e your reverence, &s;aid I, prays as often (of his own accord) as a par&s;on;&mdash;and when he is fighting for his king, and for his own life, and for his honour too, he has the mo&s;t rea&s;on to pray to God, of any one in the whole world.&mdash;'Twas well &s;aid of thee, <HI>Trim,</HI> &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby.</HI>&mdash;But when a &s;oldier, &s;aid I, an' plea&s;e your reverence, has been &s;tanding for twelve hours together in the trenches, up to his knees in cold water,&mdash;or engaged, &s;aid I, for months to|gether in long and dangerous marches; hara&s;&s;ed, perhaps, in his rear to-day;&mdash;hara&s;&s;ing others to|morrow;&mdash;detached here;&mdash;countermanded there;&mdash;re&s;ting this night out upon his arms;&mdash;beat up

<P>&mdash;The ACCUSING SPIRIT, which flew up to hea|ven's chancery with the oath, blu&s;h'd as he gave it in;&mdash;and the RECORDING ANGEL, as he wrote it down, dropp'd a tear upon the word, and blotted it out for ever.</P>
<P>&mdash;My uncle <HI>Toby</HI> went to his bureau,&mdash;put his pur&s;e into his breeches pocket, and having or|dered the Corporal to go early in the morning for a phy&s;ician,&mdash;he went to bed and fell a&s;leep.</P>

his eye-lids,&mdash;and hardly could the wheel at the ci&s;tern turn round its circle,&mdash;when my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> who had ro&s;e up an hour before his wonted time, entered the Lieutenant's room, and without pre|face or apology, &s;at him&s;elf down upon the chair by the bed-&s;ide, and independently of all modes and cu&s;toms, opened the curtain in the manner an old friend and brother officer would have done it, and a&s;ked him how he did,&mdash;how he had re&s;ted in the night,&mdash;what was his complaint,&mdash;where was his pain,&mdash;and what he could do to help him:&mdash;and without giving him time to an&s;wer any one of the enquiries, went on and told him of the little plan which he had been concerting with the Corporal the night before for him.&mdash;</P>

<P>There was a frankne&s;s in my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI>&mdash;not the <HI>effect</HI> of familiarity,&mdash;but the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of it,&mdash;which let you at once into his &s;oul,&mdash;and &s;hewed you the goodne&s;s of his nature; to this, there was &s;omething in his looks, and voice, and manner,
<PB N="18" REF="30">
&s;uperadded, which eternally beckoned to the un|fortunate to come and take &s;helter under him; &s;o that before my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> had half fini&s;hed the kind offers he was making to the father, had the &s;on in&s;en&s;ibly pre&s;&s;ed up clo&s;e to his knees, and had taken hold of the brea&s;t of his coat, and was pulling it towards him.&mdash;The blood and &s;pirits of <HI>Le Fever,</HI> which were waxing cold and &s;low within him, and were retreating to their la&s;t citadel, the heart,&mdash;rallied back,&mdash;the film for&s;ook his eyes for a mo|ment,&mdash;he looked up wi&s;hfully in my uncle <HI>Toby's</HI> face,&mdash;then ca&s;t a look upon his boy,&mdash;and that <HI>ligament,</HI> fine as it was,&mdash;was never broken.&mdash;</P>
<P>Nature in&s;tantly ebb'd again,&mdash;the film returned to its place,&mdash;the pul&s;e fluttered&mdash;&s;topp'd&mdash;went on&mdash;throbb'd&mdash;&s;topp'd again&mdash;moved&mdash;&s;topp'd&mdash;&s;hall I go on?&mdash;No.</P>
<P>All that is nece&s;&s;ary to be added is as follows&mdash;</P>
<P>That my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> with young <HI>Le Fever</HI> in his hand, attended the poor Lieutenant, as chief mourners, to his grave.</P>
<P>When my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> had turned every thing into money, and &s;ettled all accounts betwixt the

agent of the regiment and <HI>Le Fever,</HI> and betwixt <HI>Le Fever</HI> and all mankind,&mdash;there remained no|thing more in my uncle <HI>Toby's</HI> hands, than an old regimental coat and a &s;word; &s;o that my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> found little or no oppo&s;ition from the world in taking admini&s;tration.

<P>As &s;oon as my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> had laid a foundation, he &s;ent him to a public &s;chool, where, excepting Whit&s;untide and Chri&s;tmas, at which times the Corporal was punctually di&s;patched for him,&mdash;he remained to the &s;pring of the year, &s;eventeen; when the &s;tories of the Emperor's &s;ending his army into Hungary again&s;t the Turks, kindling a &s;park of fire in his bo&s;om, he left his Greek and Latin
<PB N="20" REF="32">
without leave, and throwing him&s;elf upon his knees before my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> begged his father's &s;word, and my uncle <HI>Toby's</HI> leave along with it, to go and try his fortune under Eugene.&mdash;Twice did my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> forget his wound, and cry out, <HI>Le Fever!</HI> I will go with thee, and thou &s;halt fight be&s;ide me&mdash;And twice he laid his hand upon his groin, and hung down his head in &s;orrow and di&s;con&s;olation.&mdash;</P>
<P>My uncle <HI>Toby</HI> took down the &s;word from the crook, where it had hung untouched ever &s;ince the Lieutenant's death, and delivered it to the Corporal to brighten up;&mdash;and having detained <HI>Le Fever</HI> a &s;ingle fortnight to equip him, and contract for his pa&s;&s;age to Leghorn,&mdash;he put the &s;word into his hand,&mdash;If thou art brave, <HI>Le Fever,</HI> &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> this will not fail thee,&mdash;but Fortune, &s;aid he, (mu&s;ing a little)&mdash;Fortune may&mdash;And if &s;he does,&mdash;added my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> embracing him, come back again to me, <HI>Le Fever,</HI> and we will &s;hape thee another cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t injury could not have oppre&s;&s;ed the heart of <HI>Le Fever</HI> more than my uncle <HI>Toby's</HI> pa|ternal kindne&s;s;&mdash;he parted from my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> as the be&s;t of &s;ons from the be&s;t of fathers&mdash;both dropped tears&mdash;and as my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> gave him

his la&s;t ki&s;s, he &s;lipped &s;ixty guineas, tied up in an old pur&s;e of his father's, in which was his mother's ring, into his hand,&mdash;and bid God ble&s;s him.</P>
<P><HI>Le Fever</HI> got up to the Imperial army ju&s;t time enough to try what metal his &s;word was made of, at the defeat of the <HI>Turks</HI> before <HI>Belgrade;</HI> but a &s;eries of unmerited mi&s;chances had pur&s;ued him from that moment, and trod clo&s;e upon his heels for four years together after: he had with&s;tood the&s;e bu&s;&s;etings to the la&s;t, till &s;ickne&s;s overtook him at <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> from whence he wrote my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> word, he had lo&s;t his time, his &s;ervices, his health, and, in &s;hort, every thing but his &s;word;&mdash;and was waiting for the fir&s;t &s;hip to return back to him</P>
<P><HI>Le Fever</HI> was hourly expected; and was upper|mo&s;t in my uncle <HI>Toby's</HI> mind all the time my father was giving him and <HI>Yorick</HI> a de&s;cription of what kind of a per&s;on he would choo&s;e for a precep|tor to me: but as my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> thought my father at fir&s;t &s;omewhat fanciful in the accompli&s;h|ments he required, he forbore mentioning <HI>Le Fever's</HI> name,&mdash;till the character, by <HI>Yorick's</HI> inter|po&s;ition, ending unexpectedly, in one, who &s;hould be gentle tempered, and generous, and good, it im|pre&s;&s;ed

<P>SEEING a man &s;tanding with a ba&s;ket on the other &s;ide of a &s;treet, in Ver&s;ailles, as if he had &s;omething to &s;ell, I bid La Fleur go up to him and enquire for the Count de B***'s hotel.</P>
<P>La Fleur returned a little pale: and told me it was a Chevalier de St. Louis &s;elling <HI>pat&eacute;s</HI>&mdash;It is im|po&s;&s;ible, La Fleur! &s;aid I.&mdash;La Fleur could no more account for the phenomenon than my&s;elf; but per&s;i&s;ted in his &s;tory: he had &s;een the croix &s;et in gold, with its red ribband, he &s;aid, tied to his button-hole&mdash;and had looked into his ba&s;ket and &s;een the <HI>pat&eacute;s</HI> which the Chevalier was &s;elling; &s;o could not be mi&s;taken in that.</P>
<P>Such a rever&s;e in a man's life awakens a better principle than curio&s;ity: I could not help looking for &s;ome time at him as I &s;at in the <HI>remi&s;e</HI>&mdash;the more I looked at him, his croix and his ba&s;ket, the &s;tronger they wove them&s;elves into my brain&mdash;I got out of the <HI>remi&s;e</HI> and went towards him.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="45">
He was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees, and with a &s;ort of a bib which went half way up his brea&s;t; upon the top of this, but a little below the hem, hung his croix. His ba&s;ket of little <HI>pat&eacute;s</HI> was covered over with a white dama&s;k napkin; another of the &s;ame kind was &s;pread at the bottom; and there was a look of <HI>propret&eacute;</HI> and neatne&s;s throughout; that one might have bought his <HI>pat&eacute;s</HI> of him, as much from appe|tite as &s;entiment.</P>

<P>WHEN &s;tates and empires have their periods of declen&s;ion, and feel in their turns what di&s;tre&s;s and poverty is&mdash;I &s;top not to tell the cau&s;es which gradually brought the hou&s;e d'E**** in Britanny into decay. The Marquis d'E**** had fought up again&s;t his condition with great firm|ne&s;s; wi&s;hing to pre&s;erve, and &s;till &s;hew to the world, &s;ome little fragments of what his ance&s;tors had been&mdash;their indi&s;cretions had put it out of his power.

But in Britanny, there being a provi&s;ion for this, he availed him&s;elf of it; and taking an occa&s;ion when the &s;tates were a&s;&s;embled at Rennes, the Marquis, attended with his two &s;ons, entered the court; and having pleaded the right of an ancient law of the duchy, which, though &s;eldom claimed, he &s;aid, was no le&s;s in force; he took his &s;word from his &s;ide&mdash;Here, &s;aid he, take it; and be tru&s;ty guardians of it, till better times put me in condition to reclaim it.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ident accepted the Marquis's &s;word&mdash;he &s;taid a few minutes to &s;ee it depo&s;ited in the archives of his hou&s;e, and departed.</P>

<P>It was an incident of good fortune which will never happen to any traveller, but a &s;entimental one, that I &s;hould be at Rennes at the very time of this &s;olemn requi&s;ition: I call it &s;olemn&mdash;it was &s;o to me.</P>

<P>"Let him declaim as pompou&s;ly as he choo&s;es upon the &s;ubject, it will be found to re&s;t upon no better foundation than either his intere&s;t, his pride, his ea&s;e, or &s;ome &s;uch little and changeable pa&s;&s;ion as will give us but &s;mall dependance upon his actions in matters of great di&s;tre&s;s."</P>

<P>"But put it otherwi&s;e, namely, that intere&s;tlay, for once, on the other &s;ide; that a ca&s;e &s;hould happen wherein the one, without &s;tain to his reputation, could &s;ecrete my fortune, and

<P>"As, therefore, we can have no dependence upon morality without religion;&mdash;&s;o, on the other hand, there is nothing better to be ex|pected from religion without morality; ne|verthele&s;s, 'tis no prodigy to &s;ee a man who&s;e real moral character &s;tands very low, who yet entertains the highe&s;t notion of him|&s;elf, in the light of a religious man."</P>

<P>When <HI>Tom,</HI> an' plea&s;e your honour, got to the &s;hop, there was nobody in it, but a poor negro girl, with a bunch of white feathers &s;light|ly tied to the end of a long cane, flapping away flies&mdash;not killing them.&mdash;</P>

<P>I was telling my &s;ufferings to a young woman at a pea&s;ant's hou&s;e, where our cart, which was the la&s;t of the line, had halted, they had helped me in, and the young woman had taken a cordial out of her pocket and dropp'd it upon &s;ome &s;ugar, and &s;eeing it had cheer'd me, &s;he had given it me a &s;econd and a third time&mdash;So I was telling her, an' plea&s;e your honour, the angui&s;h I was in, and was &s;aying it was &s;o in|tolerable to me, that I had much rather lie down upon the bed, turning my face towards one which was in the corner of the room&mdash;and die, than go on&mdash;when, upon her attempting to lead me to it, I fainted away in her arms. She was

a good &s;oul! as your honour, &s;aid the Coporal, wiping his eyes, will hear.</P>
<P>I thought love had been a joyous thing, quoth my uncle <HI>Toby.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis the mo&s;t &s;erious thing, an' plea&s;e your honour (&s;ometimes), that is in the world.</P>
<P>By the per&s;ua&s;ion of the young woman, con|tinued the Corporal, the cart with the wounded men &s;et off without me: &s;he had a&s;&s;ured them I &s;hould expire immediately if I was put into the cart. So when I came to my&s;elf&mdash;I found my|&s;elf in a &s;till quiet cottage, with no one but the young woman, and the pea&s;ant and his wife. I was laid acro&s;s the bed in the corner of the room, with my wounded leg upon a chair, and the young woman be&s;ide me, holding the corner of her handkerchief dipp'd in vinegar to my no&s;e with one hand, and rubbing my temples with the other.</P>
<P>I took her at fir&s;t for the daughter of the pea&s;ant; (for it was no inn)&mdash;&s;o had offered her a little pur&s;e with eighteen florins, which my poor brother <HI>Tom</HI> (here <HI>Trim</HI> wip'd his eyes)
<PB N="83" REF="95">
had &s;ent me as a token, by a recruit, ju&s;t before he &s;et out for <HI>Li&s;bon.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>The young woman called the old man and his wife into the room, to &s;hew them the money, in order to gain me credit for a bed and what little nece&s;&s;aries I &s;hould want, till I &s;hould be in a condition to be got to the ho&s;pital&mdash;Come then! &s;aid &s;he, tying up the little pur&s;e,&mdash;I'll be your banker&mdash;but as that office alone will not keep me employ'd, I'll be your nur&s;e too.</P>
<P>I thought by her manner of &s;peaking this, as well as by her dre&s;s, which I then began to con|&s;ider more attentively&mdash;that the young woman could not be the daughter of the pea&s;ant. She was in black down to her toes, with her hair concealed under a cambrick border, laid clo&s;e to her forehead: &s;he was one of tho&s;e kind of Nuns, an' plea&s;e your honour, of which your honour knows, there are a good many in <HI>Flanders,</HI> which they let go loo&s;e&mdash;By thy de&s;|cription, <HI>Trim,</HI> &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> I dare &s;ay &s;he was a young <HI>Beguine,</HI> of which there are none to be found any where but in the <HI>Spani&s;h Nether|lands</HI>&mdash;except at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI>&mdash;they differ from Nuns in this, that they can quit their cloi&s;ter if

they choo&s;e to marry; they vi&s;it and take care of the &s;ick by profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;I had rather, for my own part, they did it out of good-nature.</P>
<P>The young <HI>Beguine,</HI> continued the Corporal, had &s;carce given her&s;elf time to tell me "&s;he would be my nur&s;e," when &s;he ha&s;tily turned about to begin the office of one, and prepare &s;omething for me&mdash;and in a &s;hort time&mdash;though I thought it a long one&mdash;&s;he came back with flannels, &amp;c. &amp;c. and having fomented my knee &s;oundly for a couple of hours, and made me a thin ba&s;on of gruel for my &s;upper&mdash;&s;he wi&s;h'd me re&s;t, and promi&s;ed to be with me early in the morning.&mdash;She wi&s;h'd me, an' plea&s;e your honour, what was not to be had.

<P>I prithee, quoth my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI> inform me how this matter happened.</P>
<P>&mdash;With all plea&s;ure, &s;aid the Corporal, making a bow. I had e&s;caped, continued the Corporal, all that time from falling in love, and
<PB N="86" REF="98">
had gone on to the end of the chapter, had it not been prede&s;tined otherwi&s;e&mdash;there is no re|&s;i&s;ting our fate. It was on a Sunday, in the afternoon, as I told your honour. The old man and his wife had walked out&mdash;Every thing was &s;till and hu&s;h as midnight about the hou&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>There was not &s;o much as a duck or a duck|ling about the yard; when the fair <HI>Beguine</HI> came in to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>My wound was then in a fair way of doing well&mdash;the inflammation had been gone off for &s;ome time, but it was &s;ucceeded with an itching both above and below my knee, &s;o in&s;ufferable, that I had not &s;hut my eyes the whole night for it. Let me &s;ee it, &s;aid &s;he, kneeling down upon the ground parallel to my knee, and laying her hand upon the part below it&mdash;it only wants rub|bing a little, &s;aid the <HI>Beguine;</HI> &s;o covering it with the bed cloaths, &s;he began with the fore-finger of her right-hand to rub under my knee, guiding her fore-finger backwards and forwards by the edge of the flannel, which kept on the dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>In five or &s;ix minutes I felt &s;lightly the end of her &s;econd finger&mdash;and pre&s;ently it was laid
<PB N="87" REF="99">
flat with the other, and &s;he continued rubbing in that way round and round for a good while; it then came into my head, that I &s;hould fall in love&mdash;I blu&s;hed when I &s;aw how white a hand &s;he had&mdash;I &s;hall never, an' plea&s;e your honour, behold another hand &s;o white whil&s;t I live.&mdash;</P>
<P>The young <HI>Beguine,</HI> continued the Corporal, perceiving it was of great &s;ervice to me&mdash;from rubbing, for &s;ome time, with two fingers&mdash;proceeded to rub at length with three&mdash;till by little and little &s;he brought down the fourth, and then rubbed with her whole hand: I will never &s;ay another word, an' plea&s;e your honour, upon hands again&mdash;but is was &s;ofter than &s;atin.&mdash;</P>
<P>Prithee, <HI>Trim,</HI> commend it as much as thou wilt, &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby;</HI> I &s;hall hear thy &s;tory with the more delight&mdash;The Corporal thanked his ma&s;ter mo&s;t unfeignedly; but having nothing to &s;ay upon the <HI>Beguine's</HI> hand but the &s;ame over again&mdash;he proceeded to the effects of it.</P>
<P>The fair <HI>Beguine,</HI> &s;aid the Corporal, con|tinued rubbing with her whole hand under my knee,&mdash;till I feared her zeal would weary her&mdash;"I would do a thou&s;and times more," &s;aid &s;he,
<PB N="88" REF="100">
"for the love of Chri&s;t." As &s;he continued rubbing&mdash;I felt it &s;pread from under her hand, an' plea&s;e your honour, to every part of my frame.&mdash;</P>
<P>The more &s;he rubbed, and the longer &s;trokes &s;he took&mdash;the more the fire kindled in my veins&mdash;till at length, by two or three &s;trokes longer than the re&s;t&mdash;my pa&s;&s;ion ro&s;e to the highe&s;t pitch&mdash;I &s;eized her hand&mdash;And then thou clap|ped'&s;t it to thy lips, <HI>Trim,</HI> &s;aid my uncle <HI>Toby,</HI>&mdash;and made&s;t a &s;peech.</P>
<P>Whether the Corporal's amour terminated preci&s;ely in the way my uncle <HI>Toby</HI> de&s;cribed it, is not material; it is enough that it contained in it the e&s;&s;ence of all the love-romances which ever have been wrote &s;ince the beginning of the world.</P>

<P>&mdash;THEY were the &s;weete&s;t notes I ever heard; and I in&s;tantly let down the fore-gla&s;s to hear them more di&s;tinctly&mdash;'Tis <HI>Maria;</HI> &s;aid the po&s;tillion, ob&s;erving I was li&s;tening&mdash;Poor <HI>Maria,</HI> continued he, (leaning his body on one &s;ide to let me &s;ee her, for he was in a line betwixt us), is &s;itting upon a bank playing her ve&s;pers upon her pipe, with her little goat be&s;ide her.</P>
<P>The young fellow utter'd this with an accent and a look &s;o perfectly in tune to a feeling heart, that I in&s;tantly made a vow, I would give him a four-and-twenty &s;ous piece, when I got to <HI>Moulines.</HI></P>
<P>And who is <HI>poor Maria?</HI> &s;aid I.</P>
<P>The love and pity of all the villages around us; &s;aid the po&s;tillion&mdash;it is but three years ago, that the &s;un did not &s;hine upon &s;o fair, &s;o quick|witted and amiable a maid; and better fate
<PB N="90" REF="102">
did <HI>Maria</HI> de&s;erve, than to have her Banns for|bid by the intrigues of the curate of the pari&s;h who publi&s;hed them&mdash;</P>
<P>He was going on, when <HI>Maria,</HI> who had made a &s;hort pau&s;e, put the pipe to her mouth, and began the air again&mdash;they were the &s;ame notes;&mdash;yet were ten times &s;weeter: It is the evening &s;ervice to the Virgin, &s;aid the young man&mdash;but who has taught her to play it&mdash;or how &s;he came by her pipe, no one knows; we think that heaven has a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in both; for ever &s;ince &s;he has been un&s;ettled in her mind, it &s;eems her only con&s;olation&mdash;&s;he has never once had the pipe out of her hand, but plays that <HI>&s;ervice</HI> upon it almo&s;t night and day.</P>
<P>The po&s;tillion delivered this with &s;o much di&s;|cretion and natural eloquence, that I could not help decyphering &s;omething in his face above his condition, and &s;hould have &s;ifted out his hi&s;tory, had not poor <HI>Maria's</HI> taken &s;uch full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me.</P>
<P>We had got up by this time almo&s;t to the bank where <HI>Maria</HI> was &s;itting; &s;he was in a thin white jacket, with her hair, all but two

<P>&mdash;God help her! poor dam&s;el! above a hundred ma&s;&s;es, &s;aid the po&s;tillion, have been &s;aid in the &s;everal pari&s;h churches and convents around, for her,&mdash;but without effect; we have &s;till hopes, as &s;he is &s;en&s;ible for &s;hort intervals, that the Virgin at la&s;t will re&s;tore her to her&s;elf; but her parents who know her be&s;t, are hopele&s;s upon that &s;core, and think her &s;en&s;es are lo&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>As the po&s;tillion &s;poke this, <HI>Maria</HI> made a cadence &s;o melancholy, &s;o tender and querulous, that I &s;prung out of the chai&s;e to help her, and found my&s;elf &s;itting betwixt her and her goat before I relap&s;ed from my enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>

I do entreat the candid reader to believe me, that it was from the humble&s;t conviction of what a <HI>Bea&s;t</HI> man is,&mdash;that I a&s;k'd the que&s;tion; and that I would not have let fallen an un&s;ea&s;onable plea&s;antry in the venerable pre&s;ence of Mi&s;ery, to be entitled to all the wit that ever <HI>Rabelais</HI> &s;cat|tered&mdash;and yet I own my heart &s;mote me, and that I &s;o &s;marted at the very idea of it, that I &s;wore I would &s;et up for wi&s;dom, and utter grave &s;entences the re&s;t of my days&mdash;and never&mdash;never attempt again to commit mirth with man, woman, or child, the longe&s;t day I had to live.</P>

<P>MOULINES.</P>
<P>I NEVER felt what the di&s;tre&s;s of plenty was in any one &s;hape till now&mdash;to travel it through the <HI>Bourbonnois,</HI> the &s;weete&s;t part of <HI>France</HI>&mdash;in the hey-day of the vintage, when Nature is pouring her abundance into every one's lap, and every eye is lifted up&mdash;a journey through each &s;tep of which mu&s;ic beats time to <HI>Labour,</HI> and all her children are rejoicing as they carry in their clu&s;ters&mdash;to pa&s;s through this with my affections flying out, and kindling at every group before me&mdash;and every one of them was pregnant with adventures.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t heaven!&mdash;it would fill up twenty volumes&mdash;and alas! I have but a few &s;mall pages left of this to crowd it into&mdash;and half of the&s;e mu&s;t be taken up with the poor <HI>Maria</HI> my friend Mr. <HI>Shandy</HI> met with near <HI>Moulines.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;tory he had told of that di&s;ordered maid affected me not a little in the reading; but when
<PB N="94" REF="106">
I got within the neighbourhood where &s;he lived, it returned &s;o &s;trong into my mind, that I could not re&s;i&s;t an impul&s;e which prompted me to go half a league out of the road, to the village where her parents dwelt, to enquire after her.</P>
<P>'Tis going, I own, like the knight of the Woe|ful Countenance, in que&s;t of melancholy adven|tures&mdash;but I know not how it is, but I am never &s;o perfectly con&s;cious of the exi&s;tence of a &s;oul within me, as when I am entangled in them.</P>
<P>The old mother came to the door, her looks told me the &s;tory before &s;he opened her mouth&mdash;She had lo&s;t her hu&s;band: he had died, &s;he &s;aid, of angui&s;h, for the lo&s;s of <HI>Maria's</HI> &s;en&s;es, about a month before&mdash;She had feared at fir&s;t, &s;he added, that it would have plundered her poor girl of what little under&s;tanding was left&mdash;but, on the contrary, it had brought her more to her&s;elf&mdash;&s;till &s;he could not re&s;t&mdash;her poor daughter, &s;he &s;aid, crying, was wandering &s;omewhere about the road&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;Why does my pul&s;e beat languid as I write this? and what made <HI>La Fleur,</HI> who&s;e heart
<PB N="95" REF="107">
&s;eemed only to be tun'd to joy, to pa&s;s the back of his hand twice acro&s;s his eyes, as the woman &s;tood and told it? I beckoned to the po&s;tillion to turn back into the road.</P>
<P>When we had got within half a league of <HI>Moulines,</HI> at a little opening in the road leading to a thicket, I di&s;covered poor <HI>Maria</HI> &s;itting un|der a poplar&mdash;&s;he was &s;itting with her elbow in her lap, and her head leaning on one &s;ide within her hand&mdash;a &s;mall brook ran at the foot of the tree.</P>
<P>I bid the po&s;tillion go on with the chai&s;e to <HI>Moulines</HI>&mdash;and <HI>La Fleur</HI> to be&s;peak my &s;upper&mdash;and that I would walk after him.</P>
<P>She was dre&s;&s;ed in white, and much as my friend de&s;cribed her, except that her hair hung loo&s;e, which before was twi&s;ted within a &s;ilk-net.&mdash;She had, &s;uperadded likewi&s;e to her jacket, a pale green riband, which fell acro&s;s her &s;houlder to the wai&s;t; at the end of which hung her pipe.&mdash;Her goat had been as faithle&s;s as her lover; and &s;he had got a little dog in lieu of him, which &s;he had kept tied by a &s;tring to her girdle; as I looked at her dog, &s;he drew him to|wards
<PB N="96" REF="108">
her with the &s;tring&mdash;"Thou &s;halt not leave me, <HI>Sylvio,</HI>" &s;aid &s;he. I looked in <HI>Maria's</HI> eyes, and &s;aw &s;he was thinking more of her father than of her lover or her little goat; for as &s;he uttered them the tears trickled down her cheeks.</P>
<P>I &s;at down clo&s;e by her; and <HI>Maria</HI> let me wipe them away as they fell, with my handker|chief.&mdash;I then &s;teep'd it in my own&mdash;and then in hers&mdash;and then in mine&mdash;and then I wip'd hers again&mdash;and as I did it, I &s;elt &s;uch unde&s;cribable emotions within me, as I am &s;ure could not be accounted for from any combinations of matter and motion.</P>
<P>I am po&s;itive I have a &s;oul; nor can all the books with which materiali&s;ts have pe&s;tered the world ever convince me to the contrary.</P>
<P>When <HI>Maria</HI> had come a little to her&s;elf, I a&s;ked her if &s;he remembered a pale thin per&s;on of a man who had &s;at down betwixt her and her goat about two years before? She &s;aid, &s;he was un&s;ettled much at that time, but remem|bered it upon two accounts&mdash;that ill as &s;he was, &s;he &s;aw the per&s;on pitied her; and next, that
<PB N="97" REF="109">
her goat had &s;tolen his handkerchief, and &s;he had beat him for the theft&mdash;&s;he had wa&s;h'd it, &s;he &s;aid, in the brook, and kept it ever &s;ince in her pocket to re&s;tore it to him in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould ever &s;ee him again, which, &s;he added, he had half promi&s;ed her. As &s;he told me this, &s;he took the handkerchief out of her pocket to let me &s;ee it; &s;he had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine leaves, tied round with a tendril&mdash;on opening it, I &s;aw an S mark'd in one of the corners.</P>
<P>She had &s;ince that, &s;he told me, &s;tray'd as far as <HI>Rome,</HI> and walk'd round St. <HI>Peter's</HI> once&mdash;and return'd back&mdash;that &s;he found her way alone acro&s;s the <HI>Apennines</HI>&mdash;had travell'd over all <HI>Lombardy</HI> without money&mdash;and through the flinty roads of <HI>Savoy</HI> without &s;hoes&mdash;how &s;he had borne it, and how &s;he had got &s;upported, &s;he could not tell&mdash;but <HI>God tempers the wind,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Maria, to the &s;horn lamb.</HI></P>
<P>Shorn indeed! and to the quick, &s;aid I; and wa&s;t thou in my own land, where I have a cot|tage, I would take thee to it and &s;helter thee: thou &s;hould&s;t eat of my own bread, and drink of my own cup&mdash;I would be kind to thy <HI>Sylvio</HI>&mdash;in all thy weakne&s;&s;es and wanderings I

would &s;eek after thee and bring thee back&mdash;when the &s;un went down I would &s;ay my prayers; and when I had done thou &s;hould&s;t play thy even|ing &s;ong upon thy pipe, nor would the incen&s;e of my &s;acrifice be wor&s;e accepted for entering heaven along with that of a broken heart.</P>
<P>Nature melted within me, as I utter'd this; and <HI>Maria</HI> ob&s;erving, as I took out my handker|chief, that it was &s;teep'd too much already to be of u&s;e, would needs go wa&s;h it in the &s;tream&mdash;and where will you dry it, <HI>Maria?</HI> &s;aid I&mdash;I will dry it in my bo&s;om, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;'twill do me good.</P>
<P>And is your heart &s;till &s;o warm, <HI>Maria?</HI> &s;aid I.</P>
<P>I touch'd upon the &s;tring on which hung all her &s;orrows&mdash;&s;he look'd with wi&s;tful di&s;order for &s;ometime in my face; and then, without &s;aying any thing, took her pipe, and play'd her &s;ervice to the Virgin&mdash;The &s;tring I had touch'd cea&s;ed to vibrate&mdash;in a moment or two <HI>Maria</HI> returned to her&s;elf&mdash;let her pipe fall&mdash;and ro&s;e up.</P>
<P>And where are you going, <HI>Maria?</HI> &s;aid I.&mdash;She &s;aid, to <HI>Moulines.</HI>&mdash;Let us go, &s;aid I, toge|ther.&mdash;<HI>Maria</HI>

put her arm within mine, and lengthening the &s;tring, to let the dog follow&mdash;in that order we entered <HI>Moulines.</HI></P>
<P>Though I hate &s;alutations and greetings in the market-place, yet when we got into the middle of this, I &s;topp'd to take my la&s;t look and la&s;t farewell of <HI>Maria.</HI></P>

<P>A SHOE coming loo&s;e from the fore-foot of the thill-hor&s;e, at the beginning of the a&s;cent of mount <HI>Taurira,</HI> the po&s;tillion di&s;|mounted, twi&s;ted the &s;hoe off, and put it in his pocket; as the a&s;cent was of five or &s;ix miles, and that hor&s;e our main dependence, I made a point of having the &s;hoe fa&s;ten'd on again, as well as we could; but the po&s;tillion had thrown away the nails, and the hammer in the chai&s;e|box,

They were all &s;itting down together to their lentil-&s;oup; a large wheaten loaf was in the middle of the table; and a flaggon of wine at each end of it promi&s;ed joy thro' the &s;tages of the repa&s;t&mdash;'twas a fea&s;t of love.</P>

<HEAD>THE MONK.</HEAD>
<P>CALAIS.</P>
<P>A POOR monk of the order of St. Francis came into the room to beg &s;omething for his Convent. No man cares to have his virtues the &s;port of contingencies&mdash;or one man may be generous as another man is pui&s;&s;ant&mdash;<HI>&s;ed non, quo ad hanc</HI>&mdash;or be it as it may&mdash;for there is no regular rea&s;oning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours; they may depend upon the &s;ame cau&s;es, for aught I know, which influence the tides them&s;elves&mdash;'twould oft be no di&s;credit to us, to &s;uppo&s;e it was &s;o: I'm &s;ure at lea&s;t for my&s;elf, that in many a ca&s;e I &s;hould be more highly &s;atisfied, to have it &s;aid by the world, "I had had an affair with the moon, in which there was neither &s;in nor &s;hame," than have it pa&s;s altogether as my own act and deed, where|in there was &s;o much of both.</P>
<P>&mdash;But be this as it may: The moment I ca&s;t my eyes upon him, I was predetermined not to
<PB N="113" REF="125">
give him a &s;ingle &s;ous, and accordingly I put my pur&s;e into my pocket&mdash;button'd it up&mdash;&s;et my|&s;elf a little more upon my centre, and advanced up gravely to him: there was &s;omething, I fear, forbidding in my look: I have his figure this moment before my eyes, and think there was that in it which de&s;erved better.</P>
<P>The monk, as I judged from the break in his ton&s;ure, a few &s;catter'd white hairs upon his temples, being all that remained of it, might be about &s;eventy&mdash;but from his eyes, and that &s;ort of fire that was in them, which &s;eemed more temper'd by courte&s;y than years, could be no more than &s;ixty&mdash;Truth might lie be|tween&mdash;He was certainly &s;ixty-five; and the general air of his countenance, notwith&s;tanding &s;omething &s;eemed to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time, agreed to the account.</P>
<P>It was one of tho&s;e heads, which Guido has often painted&mdash;mild, pale&mdash;penetrating, free from all common-place ideas of fat contented ig|norance looking downwards upon the earth&mdash;it look'd forwards; but look'd, as if it look'd at &s;omething beyond this world. How one of his order came by it, heaven above, who let it fall
<PB N="114" REF="126">
upon a monk's &s;houlders, be&s;t knows: but it would have &s;uited a Bramin, and had I met it upon the plains of Indo&s;tan, I had reverenced it.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of his outline may be given in a few &s;trokes; one might put it into the hands of any one to de&s;ign, for 'twas neither elegant or other|wi&s;e, but as character and expre&s;&s;ion made it &s;o: it was a thin, &s;pare form, &s;omething above the common &s;ize, if it lo&s;t not the di&s;tinction by a bend forward in the figure&mdash;but it was the atti|tude of Intreaty; and as it now &s;tands pre&s;ent to my imagination, it gain'd more than it lo&s;t by it.</P>
<P>When he had entered the room three paces, he &s;tood &s;till; and laying his left hand upon his brea&s;t, (a &s;lender white &s;taff with which he jour|ney'd being in his right)&mdash;when I had got clo&s;e up to him, he introduced him&s;elf with the little &s;tory of the wants of his convent, and the pover|ty of his order&mdash;and did it with &s;o &s;im|ple a grace&mdash;and &s;uch an air of deprecation was there in the whole ca&s;t of his look and figure&mdash;I was bewitch'd not to have been &s;truck with it.</P>

<P>The poor Franci&s;can made no reply: a hectic of a moment pa&s;s'd acro&s;s his cheek, but could not tarry&mdash;Nature &s;eemed to have had done with her re&s;entments in him; he &s;hewed none&mdash;but letting his &s;taff fall within his arm, he pre&s;s'd both his hands with re&s;ignation upon his brea&s;t, and retired.</P>
<P>My heart &s;mote me the moment he &s;hut the door&mdash;P&s;ha! &s;aid I, with an air of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, three &s;everal times&mdash;but it would not do: every ungracious &s;yllable I had utter'd, crouded back into my imagination: I reflected, I had no right over the poor Franci&s;can, but to deny him; and

that the puni&s;hment of that was enough to the di&s;&s;appointed, without the addition of unkind language&mdash;I con&s;ider'd his grey hairs&mdash;his courteous figure &s;eem'd to re-enter and gently a&s;k me what injury he had done me?&mdash;and why I could u&s;e him thus?&mdash;I would have given twenty livres for an advocate&mdash;I have behaved very ill, &s;aid I within my&s;elf; but I have only ju&s;t &s;et out upon my travels; and &s;hall learn better manners as I get along.</P>

<P>For my own part, I declare it, that out of doors, I value not death at all:&mdash;not this . . ad|ded the Corporal, &s;napping his fingers,&mdash;but with an air which no one but the Corporal could have given to the &s;entiment.&mdash;in battle, I value death not this. . . and let him not take me coward|ly, like poor <HI>Joe Gibbins,</HI> in &s;couring his gun.&mdash;What is he?
