<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the following E&s;|&s;ay originated in a private controver&s;y; that is, a controver&s;y carried on for &s;ome time in private, between the Church of which I am a member, and &s;ome other Churches of the &s;ame de|nomination; and although I am in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;en&s;ible of my literary defects; yet &s;omething may be &s;aid by way of apology for my appearing thus in print.</P>
<P>(1) We have no other way of com|municating our &s;entiments to all who are concerned in this controver&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="4">
(2) Some who were not immedi|ately concerned herein, have heard of the di&s;pute; and our &s;entiments have been &s;o much mi&s;under&s;tood, that it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to rectify the&s;e mi&s;takes. (3) The SUBJECT in de|bate is, in our e&s;timation, of infinite importance, and of univer&s;al concern|ment; and therefore I have not con|fined my&s;elf to the que&s;tion as it &s;tood among&s;t our&s;elves; but have endea|voured to treat it in &s;uch a manner as to make this E&s;&s;ay equally intere&s;ting and u&s;eful to all who read it. (4) Although the truth of Chri&s;tianity <HI>in general,</HI> has been &s;upported with abi|lity and &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the bold at|tack made by Mr. Thomas Paine;
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
yet I have not met with any thing which I could e&s;teem as a &s;ufficient reply to the argument he has urged again&s;t that grand peculiarity of the Go&s;pel,&mdash;<HI>the doctrine of Redemption.</HI> I have therefore attempted &s;omething in that way. (5) I am in hopes that (if there &s;hould &s;eem a nece&s;&s;ity for it) this little E&s;&s;ay may give occa|&s;ion to &s;ome more able Friend, to take up his pen.&mdash;For the re&s;t, I can only &s;ay to the <HI>Critic,</HI>&mdash;Spare me!&mdash;but to the <HI>Dei&s;t, Jew,</HI> or <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> I &s;ay&mdash;Spare not!&mdash;So much by way of Apology.</P>
<P>I have u&s;ed, very freely, every thing I found to my purpo&s;e in human Authors; but I never re&s;t any part of the argument upon their <HI>Au|thority.</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
They frequently helped me to expre&s;s my own thoughts with more ea&s;e and clearne&s;s, than I could otherwi&s;e have done; and therefore I u&s;ed their Words; but &s;o far am I from building upon the authority of their Names, that I differ widely from almo&s;t all of them, upon other matters.&mdash;The Age of Popery is gone: let every man now exerci&s;e <HI>his own</HI> rea|&s;oning Powers, and <Q REND="inline">"be fully per&s;uad|ed in <HI>his own</HI> mind."</Q></P>
<P>But although I reject all human au|thority, in matters of a <HI>religious</HI> na|ture, I have &s;o frequently referred to the Authority of Revelation, that I fear the reader will not have patience to examine the Sacred Text: yet it is
<PB N="v" REF="7">
what he ought to do.</P>
<P>As to that part of the book which is controver&s;ial; I can only &s;ay, (1) I hope I have neither mi&s;repre&s;ented the &s;entiments, nor abu&s;ed the per|&s;on of any man. (2) The replies I have made, and the proofs I have ad|vanced, appear to me to be conclu&s;ive; and I am fully &s;atisfied that the doc|trine we maintain, is the mo&s;t ju&s;t to God, and the mo&s;t &s;afe to man, that can be imagined. But I do not expect that every one el&s;e will be thus minded. When we do not like a &s;entiment, it is ea&s;y to mi&s;repre&s;ent it to our&s;elves and others; we can &s;tart objections, and refu&s;e to be &s;atis|fied: and as to &s;cripture texts, we can
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
either find a different &s;en&s;e for the words as they &s;tand, or we can alter the tran&s;lation. At lea&s;t we may dar|ken or perplex the que&s;tion &s;o as to make it a matter of doubtful di&s;puta|tion which therefore ought not to be in&s;i&s;ted upon. For in&s;tance:&mdash;</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, may &s;ay,&mdash;What a piece of work is here about a &s;ingle word! Chri&s;t is called a <HI>Surety</HI> only once in all the Bible; and even then he is not &s;aid to be the Surety of <HI>Sin|ners,</HI> but the Surety of a <HI>Te&s;tament.</HI>&mdash;Yet here is a book written upon the Sureti&s;hip of Chri&s;t!&mdash;I &s;hall conclude the Preface with a reply to this.</P>
<P>(1) Although Chri&s;t is only <HI>once</HI> expre&s;&s;ly called a Surety; yet &s;ince it
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
is GOD who calls him &s;o, we are ab|&s;olutely certain that Chri&s;t does &s;u&s;|tain this Character. We do not find that it was &s;aid to Adam, any more than <HI>once,</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"On the day that thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die."</Q>&mdash;Was the threatening le&s;s certain? or of le&s;s importance? I might mul|tiply in&s;tances of this kind. The word <HI>Atonement</HI> occurs but <HI>once</HI> in the New Te&s;tament; but the thing intended thereby is often mentioned: &s;o it is with re&s;pect to the Sureti&s;hip of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the word <HI>Te&s;tament,</HI> it will be granted that it is of the &s;ame import, in this place, as the word <HI>Covenant.</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>See Mr. M'Lean's treati&s;e on the Apo&s;tolic Commi&s;&s;ion. p. 59.</BIBL></NOTE> Now as this is certainly a covenant
<PB N="viii" REF="10">
between GOD and <HI>man,</HI> Chri&s;t mu&s;t be the Surety of <HI>&s;inners,</HI> for the follow|ing rea&s;ons:</P>
<Q><P N="1">(1) "EGGUS <HI>or</HI> EGGUHTHS, <HI>A Surety;</HI> is one that undertaketh for another wherein he is <HI>defective;</HI> really or in re|putation. Whatever the undertak|ing be, whether in words or promi&s;e; or in depo&s;iting a real &s;ecurity in the hands of an arbitrator, or by any other per&s;onal engagement of life and body, it re&s;pects the <HI>defect</HI> of the per|&s;on for whom any one becomes a &s;ure|ty. Such an one is <HI>&s;pon&s;or</HI> or <HI>fideju&s;&s;or</HI> in all good authors and common u&s;e of &s;peech. And if any one be of ab|&s;olute credit him&s;elf, and of a repu|tation very unque&s;tionable, there is
<PB N="ix" REF="11">
no need of a &s;urety, unle&s;s in ca&s;e of mortality. The words of a &s;urety in the behalf of another, who&s;e ability or reputation is dubious, are, <HI>(ad me recipio, faciet aut faciam,)</HI> <Q REND="inline">"I take the matter upon me, he &s;hall do it, or I will."</Q></P>
<P N="2">(2) God therefore can have <HI>no &s;ure|ty</HI> properly, becau&s;e there can be no conceiveable <HI>defect</HI> on his part. There may be indeed a que&s;tion, whether any words or promi&s;e be <HI>his;</HI> but to a&s;&s;ure us of that, is not the work of a &s;urety, but of <HI>any means</HI> whatever that may give <HI>evidence</HI> that it is &s;o. He doth indeed make u&s;e of <HI>witne&s;&s;es</HI> to con|firm his word; that is, to te&s;tify that he hath made &s;uch promi&s;es; but the
<PB N="x" REF="12">
difference is wide enough between a <HI>witne&s;s</HI> and a <HI>&s;urety;</HI> for the latter mu&s;t be of <HI>more ability,</HI> or more credit and reputation, than he for whom he en|gages, or there is no need of his &s;ure|ti&s;hip. This none can be for God.&mdash;And if this be not the notion of a &s;urety in this place, the apo&s;tle makes u&s;e of a word no where el&s;e u&s;ed in the whole &s;cripture, to teach us that which it doth never &s;ignify among men; which is &s;ufficiently improba|ble and ab&s;urd. For the &s;ole rea&s;on why he made u&s;e of it was, that from the nature and notion of it among men in other ca&s;es, we may under|&s;tand what he a&s;cribes under that name to the Lord Je&s;us."</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="xi" REF="13">
(3) "We on all accounts <HI>&s;tand in need of a Surety</HI> for us, or on our behalf. Neither without the interpo&s;ition of &s;uch a Surety could any Covenant between God and us be firm and &s;ta|ble, or an <HI>everla&s;ting Covenant,</HI> ordered in all things and &s;ure. In the fir&s;t Covenant made with <HI>Adam</HI> there was no Surety, but God and men were the immediate Covenanters. And al|though we were then in a &s;tate and condition able to perform and an&s;wer all the Terms of the Covenant, yet was it broken and di&s;annulled. If this came to pa&s;s by the failure of the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of God, it was nece&s;&s;ary that on the making of a new Covenant he <HI>&s;hould have a Surety</HI> to undertake for
<PB N="xii" REF="14">
him, that the Covenant might be &s;ta|ble and everla&s;ting. But this is fal&s;e and bla&s;phemous to imagine. It was <HI>man alone</HI> who &s;ailed and broke that Covenant. Wherefore it was nece&s;|&s;ary that upon the making of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> and that with a de&s;ign and purpo&s;e that it &s;hould <HI>never be di&s;annulled</HI> as the former was, that we &s;hould have a <HI>Surety</HI> and undertaker for us. For if that <HI>fir&s;t Covenant</HI> was not firm and &s;table becau&s;e there was no <HI>Surety</HI> to undertake for us, not|with&s;tanding all that Ability which we had to an&s;wer the terms of it; how much le&s;s can any other be &s;o, now our Natures are become de|praved and &s;inful? Wherefore we
<PB N="xiii" REF="15">
alone were <HI>capable of a Surety</HI> properly &s;o called; we alone <HI>&s;tood in need of</HI> him, and without him the Covenant could not be firm, and inviolate on our parts. The Surety therefore of this Covenant is &s;o with God for us.</P>
<P N="4">(4) "It is the <HI>Prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t</HI> that the Apo&s;tle treats of in this place, and that alone. Wherefore, &s;eeing the Lord Chri&s;t is the Surety of the Covenant <HI>as a prie&s;t,</HI> and all the &s;a|cerdotal actings of Chri&s;t have God for their <HI>immediate object,</HI> and are per|formed with him on our behalf, he was <HI>properly</HI> A SURETY FOR US"</P><P>DR.

The following pages are de&s;igned to &s;tate and defend that work which Chri&s;t performed in the capacity of a SURETY. I have attempted to prove that he acted in this capacity, from his infancy to his death, in obeying the commandments, and &s;uffering the penalty of the Moral Law. This is the DOCTRINE, however expre&s;&s;ed, which the&s;e lines are intended to maintain. I contend not about parti|cular words or modes of expre&s;&s;ion. THE TRUTH ITSELF, and not any par|ticular mode of expre&s;&s;ing it, is that which I labour to defend. Neither is it every particular <HI>circum&s;tance</HI> at|tending the life, death, re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t, as they are
<PB N="xv" REF="17" MS="y">
&s;tated in this E&s;&s;ay, which I contend for.

<HEAD>SECTION I. On the &s;tate of Man by Nature.</HEAD>
<P>I Take it for granted that there is a GOD, who pre&s;ides over the univer&s;e, and takes notice of the moral actions of men; and con&s;e|quently that there is a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, of happi|ne&s;s and mi&s;ery. It is al&s;o rea&s;onable to believe that the MORAL LAW deli|vered by Mo&s;es, and continued as a rule of life to Chri&s;tians under the New Te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation, is, in
<PB N="2" REF="19">
fub&s;tance, the very &s;ame law which naturally binds all men; and by which God will judge the world. This law dictates to us our duty towards God and man. It al&s;o promi&s;es happine&s;s to the obedient, and condemns the &s;inner.</P>
<P N="1">1. The moral law requires that we love the only true God, with all our heart, &s;oul, mind and &s;trength: this is the fir&s;t and great commandment. The &s;econd is like unto it, namely, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy|&s;elf. Upon the&s;e two commandments hang all the law.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mat. 22. 37-40.</BIBL></NOTE> What&s;oever flows naturally from this principle of love, is a part of the moral law,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 13. 8-10.</BIBL></NOTE> and is binding upon all mankind.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 3. 19.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. This law is enforced by a pro|mi&s;e, and a threatning. If thou wilt
<PB N="3" REF="20">
enter into life, keep the Command|ments:<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mat. 19. 17.</BIBL> <BIBL>Rom. 10. 5.</BIBL></NOTE> but cur&s;ed is every one who continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gal. 3. 10.</BIBL></NOTE>&mdash;To be bound, <HI>upon the&s;e terms,</HI> to keep the commandments, is what the Scriptures u&s;ually intend by the expre&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>under the law.</HI>"<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 3. 19. Chap. 6. 14.</BIBL></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>All men are, by nature, under this law. The heathen nations, who had not this law as delivered by Mo&s;es, were neverthele&s;s bound by it, as it is made known by the light of nature. All mankind (lunaticks, idiots, and infants excepted) may, and actually do know enough of this law to con&s;ti|tute them &s;inners, and leave them without excu&s;e when they act con|trary to it.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of a law of nature, we have no occa&s;ion to &s;trive with Philo|&s;ophers
<PB N="4" REF="21">
about what they call <HI>innate ideas.</HI> Equally impertinent would it be to enquire, what impre&s;&s;ions of duty men would have had, if they were otherwi&s;e framed and &s;ituated than what they are; that is, if they were not every where &s;urrounded with the vi&s;ible works of their Creator: if they were not furni&s;hed with powers of body and mind &s;uited to perceive the&s;e works: and if they had not been made Male and Female, Parents, Children, Brethren, &amp;c. Taking men as they are, it is evident they are abundantly furni&s;hed with the means of knowledge, to render them accountable to their maker for all their ways.</P>
<P>That which may be known of God, &s;ays Paul, is manife&s;t unto men, for God hath &s;hewed it unto them. For the invi&s;ible things of Him, from the
<PB N="5" REF="22">
creation of the world are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God-head; &s;o that they are without excu&s;e.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 1. 19, 20.</BIBL></NOTE> It can do nothing toward invalidating the&s;e words of Scripture, to recount the many ab&s;urd notions of the heathen concerning the num|ber and quality of their gods; becau&s;e nothing more ab&s;urd has been either thought or done by them in regard to religion, than what has been done by tho&s;e who have lived under the &s;uperior light of revelation. If Tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation cannot prove that we are without a Bible, no more can idol|atry prove that the heathen are with|out a law of nature.</P>
<P>Having &s;hewed that the heathens tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t part of the law, (our duty toward God) the Apo&s;tle proceeds to &s;peak of tho&s;e things
<PB N="6" REF="23">
which regard man and man. And here, &s;peaking of the propen&s;ity be-between the different &s;exes, which &s;tands at the head of all other relati|ons among mankind, he calls it <HI>natu|ral;</HI> and a &s;imilar propen&s;ity between tho&s;e of the &s;ame &s;ex, he calls <HI>unnatu|ral;</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 1. 2, 6, 27.</BIBL></NOTE> therefore highly criminal. Is any other argument nece&s;&s;ary to evince its criminality, be&s;ide an ap|peal to the human brea&s;t? I hope not.&mdash;In like manner, the other relations formed by nature between parents and their offspring, between children of the fame parents, &amp;c. demand &s;uitable affection and behavour; and to counteract that affecton is to act an <HI>unnatural</HI> part. Indeed the &s;criptures every where appeal to the human brea&s;t, as fixing the law of natural affection. Thus.&mdash;Can a woman for|get her &s;ucking child?<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>I&s;a. 40. 15.</BIBL></NOTE>&mdash;Ye being
<PB N="7" REF="24">
evil, know how to give good gifts to your children.<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Mat. 7. 11.</BIBL></NOTE>&mdash;Like as a father piti|eth his children,<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>P&s;al. 103. 13.</BIBL></NOTE> &amp;c. &amp;c. Remark|able are the words of Paul. Rom. 2. 14, 15. Here he &s;ays that the Gen|tiles who had not the written law of Mo&s;es, were neverthele&s;s a law unto them&s;elves. He &s;ays they did the work of the law <HI>by nature,</HI> which &s;hew|ed it written in their hearts: not in|deed by perfect <HI>obedience</HI> to it; but, as he &s;ays, by their mutual accu&s;ations and excu&s;es touching the breaches of it. In this &s;en&s;e we &s;ee many in our own days doing the work of the law, even while they are in the act of di&s;|obeying it. We can &s;ee the mo&s;t in|famous characters among&s;t men accu|&s;ing each other, and by their rapid exchange of the odious terms, <HI>drunk|ard, whore, thief, lyar, ungrateful,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="8" REF="25">
we &s;ee them very quick &s;ighted, and very capable of doing that work of the law which con&s;i&s;ts in condemning the guilty. Now Paul &s;ays they did this in his days, <HI>by nature.</HI> Moreover,</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle &s;hews, not only that the heathen had a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, but al&s;o that they knew the judgment of God again&s;t &s;inners.<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Rom. 1. 32.</BIBL></NOTE> And when we con&s;ider how univer&s;al|ly <HI>&s;acrifices</HI> prevailed among&s;t the hea|then nations, we &s;ee Paul's te&s;timony corroborated; and we may conclude that a dread of future puni&s;hment ever haunts the guilty brea&s;t, in a greater or le&s;s degree.</P>
<P>There are two oppo&s;ite extremes which &s;ome men run into upon this &s;ubject. Some deny the very exi&s;t|ence of the law of nature; whil&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="26">
others contend for it's &s;ufficiency to bring <HI>fallen</HI> man to happine&s;s. Both parties are wrong. The law points out our duty, finds us guilty, con|demns us, and there it leaves us.</P>
<P>When we read the hi&s;tory of all times and nations,&mdash;when we con&s;i|der what daily pa&s;&s;es before our own eyes and in our own brea&s;ts, we find a melancholy proof of the scripture doctrine concerning our depraved &s;tate. The mo&s;t renowned of the heathen Philo&s;ophers<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Socrates.</NOTE> died in the pro&s;e&s;&s;ion of idolatry;<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See <BIBL>Rollin's Ancient Hi&s;tory.</BIBL></NOTE> the chief man<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Paul.</NOTE> in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ect among the Jews, was found di&s;affected to the true character of God;<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>1 Tim. 1. 13.</BIBL></NOTE> and chri&s;tians unanimou&s;ly &s;ay&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"In many things we all offend."<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>James 3. 2.</BIBL></NOTE></Q></P>
<P>How then &s;hall man be ju&s;t with God? Hail! thou SUN of RIGH|TEOUSNESS!

<HEAD>SECTION II. On the UNION between Chri&s;t and his people.</HEAD>
<P>IF in tracing the lowly &s;teps of Immanuel from Bethlehem to Calvary, we &s;hould view him as a &s;ingle indi|vidual acting for him&s;elf alone, much of the beauty of his &s;acred hi&s;tory would be lo&s;t. To guard again&s;t this, it may be u&s;eful to take &s;ome notice in this place of the unity, or onene&s;s, of Chri&s;t and his Elect. The in|&s;pired writers &s;peak much of this union, and illu&s;trate it in a variety of ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. This union was fore-ordained&mdash;it was fixed upon in the Divine mind
<PB N="12" REF="29">
before the foundation of the world: &s;ee Ephe&s;ians, Chap. 1. throughout.</P>
<P N="2">2. This union began to appear un|der the Old Te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation. It was prefigured by various types, even from the Creation downward.

<P>This medium of proof had been pre|viou&s;ly fixed upon.

<P>Je&s;us, without an Angel, could ea&s;ily have opened him&s;elf a pa&s;&s;age from the tomb; but it was meet that

<P>After the women had departed, Peter and John came to the &s;epulchre, to examine the truth of what Mary Magdalene had told them concerning the body of Je&s;us being taken away; and Mary her&s;elf followed them.

<HEAD>PART II. OBJECTIONS ANSWERED.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="objection">
<HEAD>OBJECTION I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE famous Author of the Age of Rea&s;on &s;ays,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>The doctrine of Redemption has for its ba&s;is, an idea of pecuniary ju&s;tice, and not that of moral ju&s;tice. If I owe a per&s;on money, and am not able to pay him, and he threatens to put me in pri&s;on, another per&s;on may take the debt upon him&s;elf, and pay it for me; but if I have committed a crime, every circum&s;tance of the ca&s;e is changed: moral ju&s;tice cannot take the in|nocent for the guilty, even if the innocent would offer it&s;elf.</HI>"</Q> To this we reply,</P>
<P N="1">1. This di&s;tinction between <HI>moral</HI> Ju&s;tice, and <HI>pecuniary</HI> Ju&s;tice, has no
<PB N="82" REF="99">
foundation in the nature of things. Ju&s;tice is <HI>moral</HI> Ju&s;tice &s;till, whether it has to do with money or with mur|der. When the moral law &s;ays, Owe no man any thing, it delivers a <HI>moral</HI> precept, and &s;peaks the language of <HI>moral</HI> Ju&s;tice, no le&s;s than when it &s;ays, Thou &s;halt not kill. What! is it no <HI>crime</HI> to contract debts when we are not able to pay? Surely it is. Yet if my friend is willing to become Surety for me, however innocent he may be, moral Ju&s;tice requires that he &s;hould &s;mart for it.</P>
<P N="2">2. When a Surety is admitted in any ca&s;e, his admi&s;&s;ion is founded, not upon Ju&s;tice <HI>only,</HI> but al&s;o upon mercy. If I owe money and am not able to pay it; and if Ju&s;tice admits of ano|ther per&s;on taking the debt upon him&s;elf and di&s;charging it for me, this is uniting Ju&s;tice and mercy to|gether.
<PB N="83" REF="100">
When my friend &s;ees me in di&s;tre&s;s, takes my place, and di&s;charges my debts; this is an act of <HI>mercy;</HI>&mdash;Ju&s;tice admits, but mercy performs it. Again: When my creditor demands payment of my Surety, his doing &s;o is an act of Ju&s;tice. So that, in this ca&s;e, Ju&s;tice <HI>demands,</HI> and mercy <HI>grants</HI> payment.</P>
<P N="3">3. From hence we may di&s;cover the principle upon which the office of a Surety is founded. It is ordained chiefly for the &s;ake of harmonizing Ju&s;tice and mercy. The&s;e two attri|butes, in many ca&s;es, &s;eem to cla&s;h. Ju&s;tice might require the law to be put in force again&s;t an unfortunate or di&s;hone&s;t debtor; while mercy might prompt a Judge to &s;pare him, either for his own, or for his mi&s;erable fami|ly's &s;ake. What is to be done in this ca&s;e? If Ju&s;tice is heard, mercy cries
<PB N="84" REF="101">
in vain: if mercy prevails, Ju&s;tice re|tires di&s;&s;atisfied: but by the interpo&s;i|tion of a Surety, mercy and Ju&s;tice ki&s;s and embrace each other. Does this render either attribute le&s;s ami|able? Far from it: It heightens their native charms.&mdash;If Ju&s;tice had refu&s;ed the propo&s;al of a Surety&mdash;a Surety every way able to an&s;wer its demands, would it not &s;eem too implacable? And upon the other hand, if mercy had in&s;i&s;ted upon the debt being can|celled without payment, when the Surety could well afford it, would it not appear an enemy to Ju&s;tice; and might not the creditor ju&s;tly complain?</P>
<P N="4">4. Having di&s;covered the principle upon which the office of a Surety pro|ceeds, to determine, in any particular ca&s;e, whether a Surety may or may not be admitted, we mu&s;t con&s;ider whether the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e
<PB N="85" REF="102">
be &s;uch, that, all things con&s;idered, the admi&s;&s;ion of a Surety can &s;ub&s;erve the mutual purpo&s;es of Ju&s;tice and mercy.</P>
<P N="5">5. We can now explain how it comes to pa&s;s that human laws can &s;o &s;eldom admit of a Surety in criminal ca&s;es. I &s;ay, <HI>&s;eldom,</HI> becau&s;e even human laws &s;ometimes go this far: as, for in&s;tance, when a <HI>crime</HI> is puni&s;h|ed by a fine, which is often the ca&s;e, a man's friend may pay it for him. Again: &s;ometimes when a crime is committed, the criminal is &s;et at liberty by finding &s;ureties for his future good behaviour; and if he afterwards is guilty of the &s;ame crime, his &s;ureties are liable to &s;uffer in his &s;tead. And again: <HI>National Ho&s;tages</HI> are a very ancient and general expedient. In this ca&s;e it is univer&s;ally allowed that, when any per&s;on delivers him&s;elf up
<PB N="86" REF="103">
as the ho&s;tage or &s;urety of his nation, he is liable to &s;uffer for the crimes of his country. But, as has been ob&s;er|ved, it is not always that human laws can admit of a &s;urety in criminal ca&s;es. This is not becau&s;e our legi&s;lators con|demn the principle it&s;elf; for if they did, how could they adopt it in the in&s;tances ju&s;t alluded to? but the rea|&s;on is, They find, in certain ca&s;es, the circum&s;tances are &s;uch that a Surety cannot be made to &s;ub&s;erve the mu|tual purpo&s;es of ju&s;tice and mercy, or an&s;wer any good end; but would ra|ther be attended with many evil con|&s;equences. For in&s;tance: When mur|der is committed, ju&s;tice demands life for life; and here it is impo&s;&s;ible, among&s;t men, to make u&s;e of a &s;urety. Becau&s;e (1) Who would willingly die for a murderer? (2) If &s;uch a per&s;on could be found, who gave him power
<PB N="87" REF="104">
over his life, to di&s;po&s;e of it in &s;uch a way? (3) There would be no &s;ecurity for the future conduct of the criminal; and therefore it would only be depri|ving &s;ociety of a u&s;eful member, to give back one who might immediately commence his former de&s;tructive practices. (4) It could not even &s;erve the purpo&s;e of mercy, becau&s;e all that mercy might gain by the &s;alvation of the criminal, it would lo&s;e again in the death of his &s;urety.</P>
<P N="6">6. For the&s;e cau&s;es we grant to the objector, that, in many ca&s;es of a cri|minal nature, <Q REND="inline">"All the circum&s;tances are &s;o changed, that moral ju&s;tice cannot take the innocent for the guilty;"</Q> that is, ju&s;tice cannot, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, admit of a &s;urety. But then, when the&s;e circum&s;tances come to be named, not one of them can be objected to the Sureti&s;hip of Chri&s;t.
<PB N="88" REF="105">
For in&s;tance, (1) He had ab&s;olute power over his own life, and a &s;ove|reign right to di&s;po&s;e of it as he &s;aw good. Moreover, having humbled him&s;elf to the &s;tate of a &s;ervant, he acted, not only by his own choice, but in obedience to the commandment of his Father. (2) No individual be&s;ide him&s;elf &s;u&s;tained the lea&s;t inconveni|ence from his undertaking. He did not redeem his people that they might continue their pernicious practices; but made it ab&s;olutely certain that they &s;hould leave them off, and begin a life of righteou&s;ne&s;s, the moment they &s;hould be made acquainted with what he had done for them. Their language upon this occa&s;ion is, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man. I re&s;tore him four-&s;old. (3) In &s;ub&s;tituting Je&s;us in the room
<PB N="89" REF="106">
of the guilty, all the ends of mercy, as well as divine ju&s;tice, were fully an&s;wered: Myriads of men were thus rai&s;ed from the greate&s;t depth of guilt and mi&s;ery, to an eternity of holine&s;s and happine&s;s. And although this co&s;t our divine Surety much, yet, in the end he obtained what he deemed an ample recompen&s;e. He had power, not only to lay down his life, but al&s;o to take it again: he &s;aw of the travel of his &s;oul, and was &s;atisfied: he &s;aw the eternal happine&s;s of his people &s;e|cured; and this gave him infinite de|light: he &s;aw every perfection of the God-head glorified in the highe&s;t, and the foundation laid for eternal halle|lujah's from all the ble&s;&s;ed: and he &s;aw him&s;elf, in his human nature, crowned with that glory which, in his divine nature, he had with his Father before the world was. The&s;e
<PB N="90" REF="107">
con&s;iderations go to prove that it was perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, as well as glorious to divine mercy, to &s;ub&s;titute Je&s;us in the room of his guilty people. To this we mu&s;t add,</P>
<P N="7">7. It would not be con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice to admit a <HI>&s;inner</HI> to glory, with|out this &s;ub&s;titution. Mercy might provide &s;uch a &s;urety as ju&s;tice could admit; but mercy could not, con&s;i&s;|tently with ju&s;tice, be&s;tow happine&s;s on the guilty without a Surety. No rea&s;on can be given why ju&s;tice &s;hould refu&s;e this Surety; but many rea&s;ons may be given why it &s;hould demand him. For in&s;tance: If the &s;inner had been &s;aved without this Surety, the divine law would be made void. The part of a &s;ubject is to obey; the part of a Sovereign is to keep up the autho|rity of his laws. Though &s;ubjects neglect their part, the Sovereign may
<PB N="91" REF="108">
do his. Though the law be broken, yet while that treatment is given to di&s;obedience and obedience which the Law-giver has appointed, the autho|rity of the law is &s;till kept up: but if the Sovereign neglect his part, di&s;|pen&s;e with the execution of the law, then the law pa&s;&s;es away, and, in effect, the Governor re&s;igns his autho|rity and tolerates all manner of wicked|ne&s;s and confu&s;ion. It is &s;hocking to that rea&s;on which God has given us, to &s;ee a magi&s;trate without power over his &s;ubjects; to &s;ee a parent without authority among his children, or a ma&s;ter among his &s;ervants: but this is nothing in compari&s;on with be|holding GOD de&s;titute of authority among his creatures. In other ca&s;es, this want of authority would produce confu&s;ion only in kingdoms or families; but in this ca&s;e it would bring the
<PB N="92" REF="109">
whole univer&s;e into di&s;order. The former would infer confu&s;ion only for a <HI>time:</HI> but this introduces confu&s;ion to <HI>eternity.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this article with two very oppo&s;ite &s;pecimens of rea&s;on|ing; and leave the Reader to his choice.</P>
<P>Mr. Thomas Paine, after telling his readers that, <Q REND="inline">"No <HI>external</HI> evidence can, at this long di&s;tance of time, be produced to prove whether the church fabricated the doctrine of redemption or not," adds, "therefore the que&s;tion can only be referred to the <HI>internal</HI> evidence which the thing carries in it&s;elf; and this," continues he, "affords a very &s;trong pre&s;umption of its being a fabrication; for the inter|nal evidence is, that the doctrine of redemption has for its ba&s;is, an idea of pecuniary ju&s;tice, and not that of moral ju&s;tice."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="110">
Jonathan &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"As the character of THE JUST GOD AND THE SAVIOUR can no where be publi&s;hed but along with the doctrine of redemption, I am a&s;&s;ured, by &s;eeing the GRANDEST CHARACTER thence ari&s;ing, that the doctrine mu&s;t be true. For to &s;uppo&s;e that the bare notion, or idea of any thing greater than God could ever be any where imagined, would be the wilde&s;t of all ab&s;urdities. Moreover, it mu&s;t be very evident that that view of God, which the lower it aba&s;es the pride of man, rai&s;es his comfort and joy the higher;&mdash;which reduces man to the mo&s;t unre&s;erved dependence, while it exalts him to the &s;ummit of all happine&s;s; could never be the contrivance of man, who&s;e &s;tronge&s;t impul&s;e is towards the gratifying of his pride, and who&s;e joy naturally ri&s;es or &s;inks according to the &s;ucce&s;s
<PB N="94" REF="111">
thereof. Therefore, when the doctrine of redemption, and the character of God thence re&s;ulting, are conveyed to my mind by the &s;ame te&s;timony, I have no room to doubt, that God, who alone can de&s;cribe his own cha|racter, is the te&s;tifier of both."<P>"This doctrine," continues Jona|than, "while it proves all my former wi&s;dom to be fooli&s;hne&s;s, opens to me a new and more delightful &s;ource of knowledge, throwing light upon a thou&s;and facts that I could never ac|count for before; &s;hewing me a no le&s;s &s;atisfactory than wonderful propriety, in all the extraordinary circum&s;tances attending the Birth, Life, Death, and Re&s;urrection of Je&s;us, and the mini&s;try of his witne&s;&s;es.&mdash;It throws light upon all the ancient &s;acred writings, and the extraordinary facts recorded in them, from the creation downwards.

In a word, I thence perceive a no le&s;s amiable than grand uniformity of de|&s;ign, in all the works of God, from fir&s;t to la&s;t. Whereas, &s;hould I &s;hut my eyes again&s;t the light i&s;&s;uing from thence, I am immediately lo&s;t in an unfathomable aby&s;s of&mdash;guilt, de&s;pair, and death."</P><P>"I am fully &s;atisfied, then, in a|greement with the Apo&s;tles, to hold this doctrine as the Go&s;pel, the Word,

<P>Thus far Jonathan.</P>
<P>The objection we have now con&s;i|dered, is &s;uppo&s;ed to come, not only from Dei&s;ts, but al&s;o from all tho&s;e nominal chri&s;tians who reject, <HI>altoge|ther,</HI> the Sureti&s;hip of Chri&s;t. As Dei&s;ts deny the authority of the Bible, and as the others pay but little homage to it's divinity, I have hitherto avoided the impertinence of quoting that Book
<PB N="99" REF="114">
in a way of proof. When arguing with &s;uch per&s;ons, it is nece&s;&s;ary to meet them upon their own ground,&mdash;the light of nature.</P>
<P>The objections which follow, come from a different people&mdash;people who admit, <HI>in part,</HI> the Sureti&s;hip of Chri&s;t; and who profe&s;s a greater reverence for the Word of God. The que&s;tion, therefore, and the medium of proof, are both changed. In the former ca&s;e, the que&s;tion was, Can divine Ju&s;tice admit of a Surety to act and &s;uffer for &s;inful men? In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, this is granted; and the que&s;tion is, What was the &s;inner's Surety bound to per|form? The former que&s;tion was argu|ed upon the ground of common &s;en&s;e; but this is to be determined by the word of God.

to form a flat contradiction to the word of God. To &s;et this in a clearer light, let us con&s;ider (1) The law to which Immanuel conformed: (2) His conformity to this law: (3) The dig|nity of the per&s;on who thus conform|ed to this law.</P>
<P N="1">1. The law to which our divine Surety conformed, is the very &s;ame law which his people were under. <Q REND="inline">"He was made under the law, to re|deem them that were under the law."</Q> The moral law may indeed be con&s;i|dered as the one law unto all God's rea&s;onable creatures, in re&s;pect of the principle from which obedience &s;hould proceed, namely, <HI>Love.</HI> But &s;till this law has different forms, according to the different natures, and al&s;o accord|ing to the different circum&s;tances of tho&s;e to whom it is given: &s;o that, in &s;ome re&s;pects, the law given to Angels,
<PB N="104" REF="123">
and the law given to men, will be different. It will not be &s;aid unto Angels,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Honour thy father and thy mother."</Q> Nor yet, <Q REND="inline">"Thou &s;halt not commit adultery."</Q> Such precepts as the&s;e are not adapted to their nature.&mdash;Again: The moral law will differ al&s;o according to the different circum|&s;tances of creatures of the &s;ame &s;pecies. I &s;hall mention two remarkable in&s;tan|ces of this, which ca&s;t con&s;iderable light upon the que&s;tion before us.&mdash;The fir&s;t is that remarkable difference in the moral duties of men, which is cau&s;ed by the entrance of Sin. The precept, <Q REND="inline">"Thou &s;halt love thy neigh|bour as thy &s;elf,"</Q> although it be the &s;ame precept both before and after the fall; yet it <HI>now</HI> binds us to do many things which would not have been our duty, if we had never &s;inned. For in&s;tance: If we had not &s;inned, this
<PB N="105" REF="124">
precept would only bind us to love the Righteous; for we and all our neighbours would have been of that de&s;cription; but &s;ince we have &s;inned, this &s;ame precept binds us to love the unrighteous; for we and all our neigh|bours are (at lea&s;t by nature) of this character.&mdash;Another important differ|ence in the moral law, which de|pends upon the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e to whom it is given, is the difference between this law con&s;idered only as a rule of life, and con&s;idered as pre&s;crib|ing the condition of acquiring happi|ne&s;s. This is not a fanciful but a real and important difference; and the per&s;ons to whom I now &s;peak, will admit it. They know that all men are by nature under this law as pre|&s;cribing the terms and condition of acquiring happine&s;s; but the believer in Je&s;us has a title to glory independ|ent
<PB N="106" REF="125">
of his own obedience; and he conforms to the law only as a rule of conduct.</P>
<P N="2">2. We are to con&s;ider Chri&s;t's con|formity to this law. And here we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, (1) Chri&s;t was made un|der the law, not before, but after the entrance of &s;in;&mdash;not when it bound man to love none but the righteous; but when it bound us to love &s;inners. (2) Chri&s;t's conformity to the law was con&s;tant and univer&s;al; that is, he <HI>continued</HI> in <HI>all</HI> things that are written in the book of the law to do them. (3) His conformity to this law was properly <HI>obedience;</HI> that is, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to its au|thority. This is plainly taught us when we are told that He was made <HI>under the law;</HI> for that expre&s;&s;ion always imports the authority of the law over its &s;ubjects. To which we mu&s;t add, (4) Chri&s;t was not only
<PB N="107" REF="126">
bound to obey this law, as a rule of life, but in order to merit the reward of obedience. This is what the &s;crip|tures u&s;ually intend by the phra&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Under the law;</HI>"</Q> and there is no rea|&s;on for under&s;tanding it differently when we are informed that Chri&s;t was <HI>made under the law.</HI> Upon the contra|ry, we have every rea&s;on for under|&s;tanding the words in their u&s;ual &s;en&s;e; for, while he was fulfilling every jot and tittle of the law, we &s;ee him, not in the &s;tate of enjoying, but of merit|ing the reward; and he obtained it DECAUSE he had loved righteou&s;ne&s;s and hated iniquity.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Heb. 1. 9.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider now the Dignity of the Per&s;on who thus obeyed the law. He is not a meer creature, like tho&s;e upon whom this law is binding. He is the independent Jehovah.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Jer. 33. 16.</BIBL></NOTE> True, he has
<PB N="108" REF="127">
clothed him&s;elf in human nature; but he is the &s;ame per&s;on &s;till. The per|&s;on who made the world; who &s;up|ports all things by the word of his power; who&s;e &s;overeign will is the &s;upreme law of the univer&s;e,&mdash;this is the PERSON who was made under the law&mdash;a law adapted to <HI>creatures&mdash;meer</HI> creatures&mdash;creatures naturally below Angels, and made far lower &s;till by &s;in!&mdash;This is the PERSON who <HI>obeyed</HI> this law&mdash;who obeyed it as dictating the terms and condition of acquiring happine&s;s! And &s;hall we &s;ay, If He had not &s;ubmitted to this as our &s;ub&s;ti|tute, He mu&s;t have done &s;o as his own per&s;onal qualification? Far be it!&mdash;Had man continued in his original purity, and had our Creator been plea|&s;ed to appear in our nature, his holi|ne&s;s would, no doubt, incline him to love his imperfect image in &s;inle&s;s
<PB N="109" REF="128">
man: But this love would not be <HI>obe|dience</HI> to the moral law: His appearing in human nature would not bring him &s;o upon a level with his creatures, that we might con&s;ider God and man as <HI>neighbours</HI> bound by the &s;ame precept, and upon the &s;ame condition, to mu|tual love. Therefore, when Imma|nuel was made under the law, it mu&s;t be that he might obey it as our &s;ub|&s;titute.</P>
<P>This argument acquires additional weight when we con&s;ider our divine Surety as made under the law after the entrance of &s;in. We have ob&s;erved that the holine&s;s of Immanuel would incline him to love his own image in <HI>&s;inle&s;s</HI> man; but it would be perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with his holine&s;s to dete&s;t the whole human race after they be|came &s;inners; and therefore, to love &s;inful man in conformity to the moral
<PB N="110" REF="129">
law, could never be e&s;&s;ential to the holine&s;s of our incarnate God. To what end then was he made under it? Why mu&s;t he fulfil every jot and tittle of this law? Why mu&s;t he do this in &s;uch a low, ob&s;cure, laborious, and &s;orrowful &s;tate? Why mu&s;t he &s;pend thirty years of his life in doing little el&s;e? Why mu&s;t he do this in the form of a &s;ervant working for a reward? Why!&mdash;Becau&s;e he was made under the law to redeem them that were under it.</P>
<P>Altho' the objector cannot prove his point without refuting the forego|ing argument, yet I am at liberty to &s;ay, that this argument is not e&s;&s;en|tial to the doctrine I contend for; I mean, it is not &s;o e&s;&s;ential as that the truth of the doctrine depends upon it.&mdash;If it were not blafphemy I might grant, for &s;ake of argument, that the
<PB N="111" REF="130">
incarnate God could not be holy if he had not been made under the moral law&mdash;if he had not obeyed that law in the manner in which we have &s;een he did obey it; yet it would not fol|low from hence that he did not obey this law for us; that is, as our Surety, and in our &s;tead; for, &s;ince this law could have had no claim upon him if he had not been made man,&mdash;&s;ince he was made man upon our account,&mdash;and &s;ince his obedience is of infinitely greater merit than that of all the elect put together; therefore no good rea|&s;on can be given why he might not obey this law for him&s;elf (if &s;uch a thing could be nece&s;&s;ary) and for us al&s;o. This <HI>alone</HI> is a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to the objection: Yet we mu&s;t remind the reader of what was &s;aid before, and that we by no means give up the former argument; for although holi|ne&s;s
<PB N="112" REF="131">
was e&s;&s;ential to our Redeemer's Sacrifice, the obedience he yielded to the law was not e&s;&s;ential to his own per&s;onal holine&s;s: he would have been perfectly holy if he had never been made under the law, or bound to obey its precepts in the manner in which he did obey them.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI></P>
<P>This objection is made up of truth and error connected together by fal&s;e rea&s;oning. It is <HI>not</HI> true that our Suretie's obedience to the law could &s;upercede the nece&s;&s;ity of his &s;uffer|ings and death; becau&s;e the wages of &s;in is death.&mdash;It <HI>is</HI> true that there are &s;ome ca&s;es in which the law has not a double demand, but an alternative; but the&s;e ca&s;es are &s;o e&s;&s;entially differ|ent from the ca&s;e of Chri&s;t and his people, that it mu&s;t be fal&s;e rea&s;oning
<PB N="114" REF="133">
which concludes that no more can be demanded in one ca&s;e than in the other. But we &s;hall be more particular:</P>
<P N="1">1. If a man could be found who had continued in all things that are writ|ten in the book of the law to do them, certainly he would not de&s;erve to &s;uf|fer the penalty, becau&s;e, in this ca&s;e, no &s;in has been committed. But it is equally certain that tho&s;e for whom Chri&s;t obeyed the law, have &s;inned; and this makes the difference.</P>
<P N="2">2. When a &s;inner has fini&s;hed his cour&s;e of tryal, and filled up the mea|&s;ure of his iniquity, then the divine law con&s;igns him over to hopele&s;s mi|&s;ery. The "Alternative" does not run thus, <HI>Either obey the commandments or &s;uf|fer the penalty, and thou &s;halt obtain the reward;</HI> but rather thus, <HI>Obey, or thou ha&s;t forfeited for ever the promi&s;ed reward, and al&s;o &s;ubjected thy&s;elf to endle&s;s mi&s;ery.</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="115" REF="134">
If obedience to the divine precepts, as a condition of life, as well as &s;uffer|ing the cur&s;e of a broken law, are not both required of the damned; it is becau&s;e their ca&s;e is hopele&s;s&mdash;they are utterly rejected, and &s;hut up in eternal de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Now I know of no other ca&s;e but the&s;e two, wherein the law does not make a double demand; and the&s;e are, each of them, e&s;&s;entially differ|ent from the ca&s;e of Chri&s;t and his people. In the fir&s;t of the two ca&s;es mentioned, the law does not demand the per&s;onally righteous to &s;uffer its penalty, becau&s;e they have not &s;inned: In the &s;econd ca&s;e, the law does not re|quire the damned to obey its precepts as a condition of life; becau&s;e the pro&s;pect of a reward is totally cut off from them: But the ca&s;e of Chri&s;t and his people &s;tands thus;&mdash;They have
<PB N="116" REF="135">
&s;inned, yet they do not &s;uffer the penalty: They have not perfectly obeyed the commandments, yet they obtain the reward due to perfect obe|dience. This difference is of &s;uch a nature as to demon&s;trate the fallacy of the rea&s;oning in the objection. To &s;ee the truth of this, let us take (1) the ca&s;e wherein the law does not de|mand the &s;uffering of its penalty; and (2) that wherein it does not demand obedience to its precepts as a condition of happine&s;s; and let us rea&s;on from each of the&s;e ca&s;es to that of Chri&s;t and his people. In the fir&s;t in&s;tance the argument will &s;tand thus:</P>
<P><HI>The law does not require tho&s;e to &s;uffer its penalty, who have obeyed its precepts and</HI> NEVER SINNED; <HI>therefore it cannot re|quire our Surety to obey its precepts and &s;uffer its penalty, altho' we</HI> HAVE SINNED!&mdash;In the &s;econd in&s;tance the argument
<PB N="117" REF="136">
runs thus: <HI>The law does not require the damned, upon whom the penalty is inflict|ed, to obey its precepts as a condition of life, becau&s;e</HI> NO REWARD OF OBEDIENCE IS GIVEN OR HELD OUT TO THEM; <HI>there|fore the law cannot require our Surety to &s;uffer its penalty and obey its precepts, al|though</HI> THE REWARD OF OBEDIENCE IS GIVEN TO US!&mdash;A man who can|not &s;ee into the fallacy of this rea&s;on|ing, I can only &s;ay of him, that his ca&s;e is lamentable. Others, it is hoped, will &s;ee, that, &s;ince the de|merit of the damned, and the reward of the righteous, are both found in the ca&s;e of a Chri&s;tian, therefore the work of his Surety mu&s;t comprehend what an&s;wers to each; that is, the <HI>penalty</HI> and the <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of the law. If not, it is evident that the eternal law mu&s;t be made void in one re&s;pect or other. If our Surety had not &s;uffered

<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>THE</HI> DEATH of <HI>Chri&s;t is that obedi|ence by which we are made righteous.

By this act of obe|dience he at once fulfilled the law to the utmo&s;t, exerci&s;ing the perfection of love to God and man, and &s;atisfying all its penal demands up|on his guilty people.

<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI></P>
<P>Some things in this objection have been already con&s;idered, viz. what is &s;aid about Immanuel <HI>qualifying</HI> him|&s;elf in holine&s;s by his obedience to the moral law; and al&s;o what is &s;aid of his obedience to the law as an <HI>ex|ample.</HI> I mention the&s;e particulars now, only to make other parts of the
<PB N="141" REF="160">
objection more plain to the Reader; for I find that many per&s;ons who read the book referred to above, do not under&s;tand the Author, upon the &s;ub|ject in hand. The <HI>Argument</HI> contain|ed in the objection, &s;hall be con&s;ider|ed pre&s;ently; but I &s;hall fir&s;t make a few ob&s;ervations upon the <HI>&s;entiment</HI> which that argument is intended to &s;upport.</P>
<P N="1">1. This &s;entiment, under&s;tood in the mo&s;t favourable light, will &s;tand thus:&mdash;Chri&s;t did not begin to act as the Surety or Sub&s;titute of his people, until about the time of his <HI>death:</HI> his foregoing obedience and &s;ufferings were not &s;ub&s;titutional, but intended for our example, and for his own per|&s;onal qualification: but in his death he &s;uffered the penalty, and al&s;o obeyed the commandments of the moral law, as his people's &s;ub&s;titute and in their
<PB N="142" REF="161">
&s;tead. And if we a&s;k, How could he obey the commandments of the moral law in his <HI>death?</HI> the an&s;wer is,&mdash;In his death he manife&s;ted the perfection of love to God and man, which is the end of the commandment and the fulfilling of the law.</P>
<P N="2">2. This appears to me to be a very dangerous &s;entiment. It &s;eems to ap|proach &s;o near the Truth, and it is &s;upported (in &s;ome in&s;tances) by &s;uch plau&s;ible rea&s;oning, and by &s;o able an Advocate, that tho&s;e who are weak in the Faith are in danger of being carried away by it.&mdash;But the Good Shepherd has &s;aid,&mdash;My &s;heep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eter|nal life; and they &s;hall never peri&s;h; neither &s;hall any pluck them out of my hand.</P>
<P N="3">3. This &s;entiment is, I &s;uppo&s;e,
<PB N="143" REF="162">
perfectly <HI>new.</HI> It is no new thing, indeed, to deny that Chri&s;t fulfilled the commandments of the moral law in his people's &s;tead; but it is of <HI>late</HI> that we have been told he did this in his death only, and not in his life. I cannot &s;peak with ab&s;olute certain|ty upon the <HI>novelty</HI> of this &s;entiment; but am of opinion that it was not thought of until the clo&s;e of the eigh|teenth Century. It has not, however, come too late to find footing in the world; for it &s;eems to be adopted by &s;everal congregations in north and &s;outh Britain, and perhaps it may give birth to another denomination of Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="4">4. At times I fancy I under&s;tand this &s;entiment pretty clearly; but at other times I find my&s;elf rather at a lo&s;s. This uncertainty is owing to the prin|ciples upon which this &s;entiment is
<PB N="144" REF="163">
&s;ometimes de&s;ended, and from which it's Advocates rea&s;on in order to op|po&s;e what they call the common popu|lar doctrine: for, the&s;e principles &s;eem to me as incon&s;i&s;tent with their own doctrine, as with that which they re|ject. For in&s;tance,</P>
<P N="1">1. Chri&s;t's obedience to the law is &s;et before us as an <HI>example</HI> for us to copy after, which &s;hews <HI>(they</HI> &s;ay) that he did not obey this law as our &s;ub&s;ti|tute, in his <HI>life.</HI>&mdash;Now the&s;e &s;ame people know that Chri&s;t's obedience in his <HI>death</HI> is al&s;o &s;et before us as an ex|ample to copy after; how then can <HI>they</HI> believe that he obeyed this law even in his death <HI>as our &s;ub&s;titute?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. They tell us that if Chri&s;t had obeyed the law for us in his life, it would have &s;uper&s;eded his expiatory &s;ufferings. Strange!&mdash;But, waving all other remarks, what is the rea&s;on that
<PB N="145" REF="164">
Chri&s;t's vicarious obedience to the law in his life, &s;hould &s;uper&s;ede his expia|tory &s;ufferings; and yet his vicarious obedience to the law in his death, &s;hould <HI>not</HI> &s;uper&s;ede them?&mdash;To this it has been replied,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"His fulfilling the law for us in his death, includes his expiatory &s;ufferings, and therefore cannot &s;uper&s;ede them."</Q> But this an&s;wer leaves me ju&s;t where I was. To tell me that, <HI>The &s;uffering of the penalty is included in Chri&s;t's vicarious obe|dience to the precepts of the law,</HI> is not to &s;hew me <HI>the u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity of this;</HI> which is the thing I am inquiring after. It is the opinion of the Objector, that if Chri&s;t had obeyed the precepts of the law in his life as our &s;ub&s;titute, then his &s;ufferings, con&s;idered as ex|piatory, would be &s;uperfluous. See|ing this is his opinion, and &s;eeing he profe&s;&s;es to believe that Chri&s;t did
<PB N="146" REF="165">
obey the&s;e precepts <HI>for us</HI> (that is, as our &s;ub&s;titute) in his death, I am at a lo&s;s to conceive what nece&s;&s;ity <HI>he</HI> finds for the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, <HI>con|&s;idered as expiatory.</HI> To tell me that his obedience to the law in his death, includes his expiatory &s;ufferings; is only to provoke a repetition of the que&s;tion&mdash;Why?&mdash;why mu&s;t this &s;ub|&s;titutional obedience include expiatory &s;ufferings? Or, &s;eeing this obedience does in fact include the&s;e &s;ufferings, how is it that the former does not ren|der the latter &s;uperfluous?</P>
<P N="3">3. When we plead for our Suretie's vicarious obedience and &s;ufferings all through his life even unto death; the Objector tells us, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;hew where the law makes this <Q REND="inline">"<HI>double demand.</HI>"</Q> He in&s;i&s;ts upon it that the law has not a double demand, but an alternative, requiring either
<PB N="147" REF="166">
perfect obedience, or el&s;e the &s;uffering of its penalty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have con&s;idered this &s;entiment before, and mention it in this place only to point out the Objec|tor s incon&s;i&s;tency.</NOTE>&mdash;This way of talking makes it very difficult to under&s;tand what the&s;e people intend to admit. One would think that what is here &s;aid, makes as much again&s;t their own &s;entiment, as it does again&s;t ours; and when they are reminded of this, their explanation only tends to involve their &s;entiment in complicated ob&s;curity. When we tell them that their own &s;entiment, al&s;o, infers a double de|mand of the law upon the &s;inner's Surety, they &s;eem inclined to admit that it does &s;o; but not <HI>&s;uch</HI> a double demand as we plead for: and they &s;ay that the double demand which they admit, may be reduced to a <HI>&s;in|gle</HI> one. Upon this I would ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) If they realy intend to admit
<PB N="148" REF="167" MS="y">
that Chri&s;t did, at any time, living or dying, not only bear the cur&s;e, but al&s;o &s;ulfil the precepts of the law <HI>as our &s;ub&s;titute;</HI> this is the double de|mand we plead for. The difference between the life and death of Chri&s;t, affects not the que&s;tion concerning a <HI>double</HI> demand of the law; for it is not length of time, but the two things demanded which con&s;titute the <HI>double</HI> demand. If our Surety had <HI>only</HI> to obey the precepts, or if he had <HI>only</HI> to &s;uffer the penalty of the law, this would be but a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> demand, al|though he had been bound thus to obey, or el&s;e to &s;uffer, all through life even unto death; and upon the other hand, if he was bound to obey, and al&s;o to &s;uffer for us, this is a <HI>double</HI> demand, although he had thus obeyed and &s;uffered only in the hour of death.</P>

But whatever ob&s;curity may attend this &s;entiment in other re&s;pects, one thing is plain, viz.

<P>To a&s;cribe &s;alvation in all it's parts to the death of Chri&s;t, and to believe,

at the &s;ame time, that Chri&s;t acted as our Surety all through his &s;tate of hu|miliation, are not &s;uch incon&s;i&s;tent things as to render it impo&s;&s;ible for an accurate &s;peaker or writer to do both.

<P>Now it is well known that the&s;e Authors had no intention to <HI>confine</HI> the Sureti&s;hip of Chri&s;t to his death It is well known that they con&s;idered Chri&s;t as the &s;ub&s;titute of &s;inners all through his &s;tate of humiliation; yet they a&s;cribe &s;alvation in all it's parts to his <HI>death,</HI> in language-<HI>as &s;trong</HI> as that u&s;ed by the Apo&s;tles.&mdash;The intelligent reader will readily perceive how far I intend this argument &s;hould go. I have no thoughts of &s;upporting any

doctrine by human authority; and therefore I do not quote the&s;e Authors to that end. It is &s;uffici|ent if they are allowed to be men who knew how to expre&s;s their own thoughts with propriety of &s;peech, and that they have actually done &s;o upon this occa&s;ion. And why &s;hould not this be admitted? They con&s;idered the <HI>death</HI> of Chri&s;t as the <HI>completion</HI> of his vicarious work, and in this view they a&s;cribe &s;alvation to it. Is this to expre&s;s their own thoughts improperly? I &s;uppo&s;e no one will &s;ay &s;o. What does this prove? It proves that to a&s;cribe &s;alvation to the death of Chri&s;t, does not amount to a denial of his having acted as our &s;ub&s;titute all through his &s;tate of hu|miliation; and con&s;equently, when the Apo&s;tles a&s;cribed &s;alvation to his death, it does not prove that they in|tended

to exclude, as &s;ub&s;titutional, his foregoing obedience and &s;ufferings.&mdash;I may here remind our oppo&s;ers of what certain of their <HI>own</HI> poets have &s;aid, and which they them&s;elves re|peatedly &s;ing, viz.<Q><L>" Tis <HI>fini&s;hed</HI>&mdash;THIS <HI>his dying groan</HI></L>

<P>The rea&s;oner who &s;hould attempt to prove from this ver&s;e, that the poet who made, or that the per&s;ons who &s;ing it, con&s;ider nothing in the &s;uf|ferings of Chri&s;t, as &s;ub&s;titutional, but his dying groan, and la&s;t expiring breath, would &s;erve the poet, and tho&s;e who adopt his words, as &s;ome men do the apo&s;tles.</P>

For in&s;tance: What adequate cau&s;e or end &s;hall we find for his dreadful &s;ufferings in the garden, and from thence to Calvary, if we deny that they were &s;ub&s;titutional? Was it merely for the &s;ake of &s;etting us an example, and qualifying him&s;elf in holine&s;s, that he began to be &s;ore amazed, and very heavy? that his &s;oul was exceeding &s;orrowful, even unto death? that he was in an agony, and &s;weat great drops of blood falling to the ground? that he was taken from hence, bound, &s;mitten, &s;pit up|on, blind&s;olded, mocked; &s;tripped

and &s;courged?&mdash;If the Objector &s;hould admit that the&s;e in&s;tances of &s;uffering were &s;ub&s;titutional, he mu&s;t then abandon his argument, and be reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of begging the que&s;tion: for the&s;e &s;ufferings were no more undergone <HI>on the tree,</HI> than were any other &s;ufferings of our Redeemer's life. And it mu&s;t be noticed, that the Apo&s;tles not only a&s;cribe our &s;alvation to his la&s;t &s;uffer|ings and <HI>death,</HI> but al&s;o expre&s;&s;ly to what he endured while hanging on the Tree.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Gal. 3. 13.</BIBL></NOTE>&mdash;But if the Objector &s;hould go &s;o far as to deny that the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t in the garden, and from thence until he was led forth to be crucified, were &s;ub&s;titutional, he ought to provide a good rea&s;on for &s;o doing; which, I am per&s;uaded, is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible.

All that I intend is, to propo&s;e one argument more, taken from what the Scriptures &s;ay of the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of Chri&s;t, in reply to the Objection now before us.</P>
<P>The Objector will not admit that Chri&s;t obeyed and &s;uffered, all through his life upon earth, as the Surety or Sub&s;titute of &s;inners. He cannot find, he &s;ays, that the Scriptures a&s;cribe our ju&s;tification directly to what Chri&s;t did in his life, but always to what he did in his death.&mdash;In reply to this we
<PB N="183" REF="202">
have &s;hewn (1) that when the Scrip|tures a&s;cribe our ju&s;tification to the death of Chri&s;t, it is not with any in|tention to exclude, as &s;ub&s;titutional, his foregoing obedience and &s;ufferings: (2) That the Scriptures do, in many places, a&s;cribe our ju&s;tification and &s;al|vation to the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t in general; that is, to <HI>all</HI> the &s;ufferings he endured in the days of his humili|ation. To the&s;e con&s;iderations we have now to add, (what we have before proved) that our ju&s;tification is a&s;cribed, and that "<HI>directly,</HI>" to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. This alone, one might imagine, is &s;uffici|ent to decide this que&s;tion. But the Objector has found out a new way to evade the force of this argument. Hitherto, the que&s;tion has been&mdash;Is the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t (includ|ing his &s;ufferings) the immediate and
<PB N="184" REF="203">
direct cau&s;e of our ju&s;tification? This que&s;tion being decided in the affirma|tive, the di&s;pute was ended. The rea&s;on was, there exi&s;ted no di&s;pute about what was meant by the <HI>Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of Chri&s;t. It was admitted upon all hands, that the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, is his conformity to the Rule of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; or in other words, the whole of his obedience to the Moral Law. For men had not as yet learned to di&s;tingui&s;h between his obedience to the precepts of the moral law in his life, and his obedi|ence to the precepts of the moral law in his death, and to a&s;&s;ign different kinds of influence to this obedience in the ju&s;tification of the ungodly. But by the help of the&s;e di&s;tinctions, the Objector can admit, in words, that our ju&s;tification is a&s;cribed directly to the Rightcou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t and yet

<P N="1">1. The Righteou&s;ne&s;s of which we &s;peak, is the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST.

<PB N="187" REF="206">
to the <HI>Ceremonial</HI> Law as our Sub&s;titute? Did he work miracles as our Sub&s;titute?&mdash;Yes, <HI>in &s;o far as his confor|mity to the</HI> MORAL <HI>Law was concerned in the&s;e things.</HI> When he attended to the ceremonial law, he did &s;o in obedi|ence to the command of God; which is not a ceremonial, but <HI>moral</HI> duty.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>1 Cor. vii. 19.</BIBL></NOTE> And while he wrought miracles, he was going about doing good;<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>Acts x. 38.</BIBL></NOTE> which is al&s;o a <HI>moral</HI> duty.&mdash;But the moral law never bound <HI>us</HI> to ob&s;erve the ce|remonial law: it never bound <HI>us</HI> to work miracles!&mdash;True; but it bound us to obey God, and to do good to man; and it is only in this &s;en&s;e that we con&s;ider the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t as concerned in Ceremonies and Mi|racles.&mdash;Indeed the&s;e things are very incon&s;i&s;tently objected to us, by the per&s;ons we now &s;peak to. <HI>They</HI> al&s;o
<PB N="188" REF="207">
profe&s;s to believe that Chri&s;t obeyed the moral law as our &s;ub&s;titute. And how do they &s;ay he did this?&mdash;By dying to redeem lo&s;t &s;inners.&mdash;But the moral law never commanded us to perform &s;uch a work as this! This was the greate&s;t miracle of all! Yet if any one was to object this to them, they would, and very ju&s;tly, con&s;ider it as an impertinent cavil. At lea&s;t they would know how to an&s;wer it; and one an&s;wer will equally &s;uit us both. Neither party need be afraid if the only thing that can be objected to us is, that Chri&s;t obeyed the law for us in a different, and far more ex|cellent manner, than could be ex|pected from us:&mdash;this is our Glory. The Righteou&s;ne&s;s of our Divine Surety does not exceed that which was demanded of the Elect, more than his <HI>Per&s;on</HI> exceeds their per&s;ons.
<PB N="189" REF="208">
But who ever objected to the Sureti|&s;hip of Chri&s;t, meerly upon account of the excellency of his Per&s;on? Yea, I have heard one man, and only one, go thus far. <Q REND="inline">"I cannot admit the doctrine of imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s," he &s;aid, "for this rea&s;on;&mdash;The works of an <HI>Infinite</HI> Per&s;on, cannot be im|puted to one that is finite."</Q>&mdash;But this &s;eems to proceed upon a mi&s;taken no|tion of the nature of that imputation of which we &s;peak.

And as the judgment of God is always ac|cording to truth, it is equally impo&s;&s;i|ble that he &s;hould <HI>&s;o</HI> impute the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t unto us, as to judge that this Righteou&s;ne&s;s is our own <HI>per&s;onal</HI> work. This therefore is not what the &s;criptures teach, neither
<PB N="190" REF="209">
is it what any chri&s;tian pleads for.&mdash;But it was not impo&s;&s;ible for the Eter|nal Word, who is an infinite Per&s;on, to take on him a finite nature; to unite him&s;elf to his elect, and be|come their &s;urety: it was not impo&s;&s;i|ble for him, in their nature, and as their Surety to obey every jot and tit|tle of the moral law, and &s;uffer its penalty; nor is it impo&s;&s;ible for God to impute this unto the per&s;ons for whom it was done; that is, it is not impo&s;&s;ible for God to place it to their account, and, upon this ground, to ju&s;|tify them from all things, from which they could not be ju&s;tified by their own per&s;onal performances. This is not impo&s;&s;ible, but divinely true.&mdash;The Righteou&s;ne&s;s of our Incarnate God, is <Q REND="inline">"unto and upon all them that believe;"</Q> but neither he who wrought, nor he who imputes this

Righteou&s;neis, nor they unto whom it is imputed, ever mi&s;take it for the workman&s;hip of a finite per&s;on. It is <HI>ours</HI> becau&s;e it was wrought for us, and is imputed unto us; not becau&s;e it is our own per&s;onal performance. There is indeed &s;uch a clo&s;e union between Chri&s;t and his elect, that, becau&s;e he died, ro&s;e, and reigns, and becau&s;e his Righteou&s;ne&s;s is divine; they al&s;o are repre&s;ented as dead, ri&s;en, reigning, and as made the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God; but they are all this IN HIM, who is their Head and Repre&s;entative. To obey and &s;uf|fer <HI>in the &s;econd Adam,</HI> is one thing; and to do &s;o <HI>in our own Per&s;ons,</HI> is another.&mdash;Con&s;idering therefore the nature and grounds of this imputation, the infinity of the Per&s;on of our Surety is &s;o far from making the imputation of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s impo&s;&s;ible, that
<PB N="192" REF="211">
the rever&s;e is true: for had he been a meer creature, he could have yeild|ed no obedience to the law of God beyond what was nece&s;sary for him&s;elf: much le&s;s could he make reconcilia|tion for the innumerable &s;ins of the whole redeemed company, and work a Righteou&s;ne&s;s which &s;hould be ade|quate to the demands of the law up|on them all. It was nece&s;&s;ary, in|deed, that he &s;hould be <HI>man;</HI> for otherwi&s;e he could neither obey the precepts nor &s;uffer the penalty of the law given to man; but it was his DI|VINITY that gave &s;ufficient worth and efficacy to the whole.&mdash;There is, then, a likene&s;s, and there is al&s;o a difference, between the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> of our Surety, and our per&s;ons; and there is al&s;o a likene&s;s and a difference be|tween what the law demanded of us, and what he performed as our Surety.
<PB N="193" REF="212">
As the children were partakers of fle&s;h and blood, he al&s;o him&s;elf took part of the &s;ame: as we were under the law, he was made under it: as the law bound us to <HI>continue</HI> in <HI>all</HI> things that are written therein, he came to fulfil <HI>every jot and tittle</HI> of the law, and he <HI>always</HI> did tho&s;e things that were plea&s;ing in his Father's fight: and as we were expo&s;ed to the righteous cur&s;e of a broken law, &s;o the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all, and he &s;uffered the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t.

<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. I think we have al&s;o proved, that the Incarnate God had no occa|&s;ion to obey the moral law for him|&s;elf; at lea&s;t not in the manner in which he did obey it all through his &s;tate of humiliation; con&s;equently it was for us he did &s;o, and not for him|&s;elf.</P>
<P N="4">4. Although the love which Chri&s;t manife&s;ted in his death, is undoubt|edly included in his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and is the mo&s;t eminent in&s;tance of it;
<PB N="195" REF="214">
yet we cannot think that this was all he intended, when he &s;aid he came to fulfil <HI>every jot and tittle</HI> of the law.

Chri&s;t's obedience to the law was not only <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> but <HI>con&s;tant.</HI> Nor was this unnece&s;&s;ary; for although this law could have had no dominion over him, if he had not been made under it to redeem; yet, after he was made under it, he was bound to obey it in all points, and to <HI>continue</HI> his obedience unto the end. There|fore all that Chri&s;t did in obedience to this law, is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to his <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. I think it mu&s;t be granted that the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of Chri&s;t, taken in the mo&s;t proper and complete &s;en&s;e of the word, includes the whole of his obedience, from his infancy to his death; and why &s;hould we under&s;tand it as intending any thing &s;hort of this,
<PB N="197" REF="216">
when our ju&s;tification is a&s;cribed di|rectly to it. But,&mdash;</P>
<P N="7">7. We call upon the Objector to produce one &s;ingle text of &s;cripture, wherein the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be under&s;tood as not including the <HI>whole</HI> of his conformity to the moral law, or eternal rule of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this E&s;&s;ay in the words of DR. J. OWEN.</P>
<Q><P>"I cannot but judge it &s;ounds ill in the ears of all Chri&s;tians," &s;ays he, "That the obedience of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t as our Mediator and Surety unto the whole Law of God, was for him&s;elf, and not for us; or that what he did therein, was not that he might be the end of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth;&mdash;e&s;pecially con&s;idering, that the &s;aith of the church is, That
<PB N="198" REF="217">
he was given to us, born to us; that for us men and for our &s;alvation he came down from heaven, and did, and &s;uffered what was required of him."</P>
<P>"It is &s;aid, <HI>That this obedience was nece&s;&s;ary as a</HI> QUALIFICATION <HI>of his Per&s;on, that he might be</HI> MEET <HI>to be a mediator for us; and therefore was for him&s;elf.</HI>&mdash;But this I po&s;itively deny. The Lord Chri&s;t was every way <HI>meet</HI> for the whole work of Mediation, by the <HI>ineffable union</HI> of the <HI>Human Nature</HI> with the <HI>Divine,</HI> which exalted it in dignity, honour, and worth, above any thing, or all things that en&s;ued thereon. For hereby he became in his whole Per&s;on the Object of Di|vine Wor&s;hip and Honour; for <Q REND="inline">"<HI>When he bringeth the Fir&s;t Begotten into the world, he &s;aith, And let all the Angels of God wor&s;hip Him.</HI>"</Q> Again, That which is
<PB N="199" REF="218">
an <HI>effect</HI> of the Per&s;on of the Media|tor as con&s;tituted &s;uch, cannot be a <HI>Qualification</HI> nece&s;&s;ary unto its con&s;titu|tion."</P>
<P>"Whereas therefore he was nei|ther made man, nor of the po&s;terity of Abraham for him&s;elf, but for the Church, namely, to become thereby the <HI>Surety of the Covenant,</HI> and <HI>Repre|&s;entative</HI> of the whole, his obedience as Man unto the Law in general, and as the Son of Abraham unto the law of Mofes, was for his people, and not for him&s;elf; it was &s;o de&s;igned, &s;o performed, and without a re&s;pect unto the Church, was of no u&s;e unto him&s;elf. <HI>He was born to us,</HI> and <HI>given to us, lived for us,</HI> and <HI>died for us; obeyed for us,</HI> and <HI>&s;uffered for us,</HI> that <HI>by the obe|dience of one, many might be made Righte|ous.</HI> This was the Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and this is the Faith of
<PB N="200" REF="219">
&s;he Church. And what he did <HI>for</HI> us, is <HI>imputed to us.</HI> This is included in the very notion of his <HI>doing it for us,</HI> which cannot be &s;poken in the true and proper &s;en&s;e, unle&s;s what he &s;o did, be <HI>imputed unto us.</HI> And I think men ought to be cautious that they do not, by <HI>di&s;tinctions</HI> and &s;tudied <HI>eva&s;ions</HI> for the defence of their own private opinions, &s;hake the foundations of the Chri&s;tian Religion. And I am &s;ure it will be ea&s;ier for them, as it is in the proverb, to wre&s;t the club out of the hand of Hercules, than to di&s;|po&s;&s;es the minds of true Believers of this per&s;ua&s;ion, viz, That what the Lord Chri&s;t did in obedience un|to God according unto the Law, he de&s;igned in his love and grace to do it for them. He needed no obedience for him&s;elf, he came not into a capa|city of yielding obedience, for him|&s;elf,
<PB N="201" REF="220">
but for us; and therefore for us it was, that He fulfilled the Law in obedience unto God, according unto the terms of it. The obligation that was on him unto obedience, was ori|ginally no le&s;s for us, no le&s;s needful unto us, no more for him&s;elf, no more nece&s;&s;ary unto him, than the obliga|tion that was on him as the Surety of the Covenant, to &s;uffer the penalty of the Law, was either the one or the other." Which may be illu&s;trated thus: "When the Apo&s;tle Paul wrote tho&s;e words unto Philemon concerning One&s;imus (ver. 18.) <HI>If he hath wronged thee,</HI> dealt unrighteou&s;ly or injuriou&s;ly with thee, <HI>or oweth thee ought,</HI> wherein thou ha&s;t &s;uffered lo&s;s by him, put it on my account, or im|pute it all unto me; I will repay it, or an&s;wer for it all: He &s;uppo&s;es that Philemon might have a double action
<PB N="202" REF="221">
again&s;t One&s;imus, the one of wrong or injury, the other of lo&s;s or debt: If he hath <HI>wronged thee, or oweth thee ought.</HI> Hereon he propo&s;eth him&s;elf, and obligeth him&s;elf by his expre&s;s obligation, <HI>I Paul have written it with my own hand,</HI> that he would an&s;wer for both. Hereby he was obliged in his own per&s;on to make &s;ati&s;faction unto Philemon; but yet he was to do it for One&s;imus, and not for him|&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Some of the ancients di&s;puted, That the Son of God &s;hould have been incarnate, although man had not &s;inned and fallen; but none of them once imagined, that he &s;hould have been &s;o made man, as to be made un|der the law, and be obliged thereby unto that obedience which he hath performed: But they judged that im|mediately he was to have been a Glo|rious
<PB N="203" REF="222">
Head unto the whole Creation. For it is a common notion and pre|&s;umption of all Chri&s;tians, (but only &s;uch as will &s;acrifice the&s;e notions to their own private conceptions,) That the obedience which Chri&s;t yielded unto the law on the earth, in the &s;tate and condition wherein he did yield it, was not for him&s;elf, but for the Church, which was obliged unto per|fect obedience, but was not able to ac|compli&s;h it."</P>
