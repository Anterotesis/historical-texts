<HEAD>ADVERTISMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the conclu&s;ion of Mr. BURKE's &s;econd Letter on the Propo&s;als of Peace, he threw out &s;ome intimation of the plan, which he meant to adopt in the &s;equel. A third Letter was mentioned by him, as having been then, in part, written. <Q>He intend|ed to proceed next on the que&s;tion of the facilities po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the French Repub|lick, <HI>from the internal State of other Na|tions, and particularly of this,</HI> for obtaining her ends; and, as his notions were contro|verted, to take notice of what, in that way, had been recommended to him.</Q></P>
<P>But the abrupt and unprecedented conclu|&s;ion of Lord Malme&s;bury's fir&s;t negociation, induced him to make &s;ome change in the ar|rangement of his matter. He took up the que&s;tion of his Lord&s;hip's mi&s;&s;ion, as &s;tated in
<PB N="ii" REF="5">
the papers laid before Parliament, his Maje&s;|ty's Declaration, and in the publick comments upon it; he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to examine the new ba&s;is of compen&s;ation propo&s;ed for this treaty; and having heard it currently whi&s;pered about, that the foundation of all his opinions failed in this e&s;&s;ential point, that he had not &s;hewn, what means we propo&s;ed to carry them into effect, he al&s;o determined to bring forward the con&s;ideration of the ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of peace, which he had po&s;t|poned at the end of his fir&s;t letter. This was the origin of the letter now offered to the Publick.</P>
<P>The greater part of this pamphlet was ac|tually revi&s;ed in print by the Author him&s;elf, but not in the exact order of the pages. He enlarged his fir&s;t draft, and &s;eparated one great member of his &s;ubject for the purpo&s;e of introducing &s;ome other matter between. Two &s;eparate parcels of manu&s;cript, de&s;igned to intervene, were found among his papers. One of them he &s;eemed to have gone over him&s;elf, and to have improved and aug|mented.
<PB N="iii" REF="6">
The other was much more imper|fect, ju&s;t as it was taken from his mouth by dictation. Of cour&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e a more ample di&s;cretion in preparing that part for the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>There is, however, &s;till a very con&s;iderable member, or rather there are large fragments and pieces of a con&s;iderable member, to which the candour and indulgence of the Publick mu&s;t be re&s;pectfully intreated. Mr. Burke had him&s;elf chalked out an accurate outline. There were loo&s;e papers found, containing a &s;um|mary and conclu&s;ion of the whole. He had pre&s;erved &s;ome &s;cattered hints, documents, and parts of a corre&s;pondence on the &s;tate of the country. He had been long anxiou&s;ly waiting for &s;ome authentick and official in|formation, which he wanted to a&s;certain, what with his u&s;ual &s;agacity he had fully anticipated from his own ob&s;ervation. When the fir&s;t two Reports of the Finance Com|mittee of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the Great Reports of the Secret Committees of both Hou&s;es, were printed, he procured and
<PB N="iv" REF="7">
read them with much avidity; but the Su|preme Di&s;po&s;er of all, in his in&s;crutable coun|&s;els, did not permit the complete execution of the ta&s;k, which he meditated.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, his friends ori|ginally inclined to lop off altogether, that member which he had left &s;o lame and mu|tilated; but the con&s;ideration, how much the ultimate credit of all his opinions might po&s;|&s;ibly depend on that main branch of his que&s;|tion not being wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, it was thought be&s;t, that &s;ome u&s;e &s;hould be made of the important materials, which he had &s;o far in readine&s;s. It was then conceived that, it might in &s;ome degree an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, to draw out mere tables of figures, with &s;hort ob&s;ervations under each of them; and they were actually printed in that form. The&s;e would &s;till however have remained an un&s;eem|ly cha&s;m, very incoherently and aukwardly fil|led. At length, therefore, it was re&s;olved, after much he&s;itation, and under a very unplea&s;ant re&s;pon&s;ibility, to make a humble attempt at &s;upplying the void with &s;ome continued ex|planation
<PB N="v" REF="8">
and illu&s;tration of the documents, agreeably to Mr. Burke's own Sketch. In performing with pious diffidence that duty of friend&s;hip, no one &s;entiment has been attri|buted to Mr. Burke, which is not mo&s;t ex|plicitly known, from repeated conver&s;ations and from corre&s;pondence, to have been enter|tained by that illu&s;trious man. Some pa&s;|&s;ages from his own private letters, and &s;ome from letters to him, which he was plea&s;ed to commend and to pre&s;erve, have been inter|woven.</P>
<P>From what has been thus fairly &s;ubmitted, it will be &s;een, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to indi|cate every period or &s;entence in the latter part of this letter, which is, and which is not, from the hand of Mr. Burke. It would &s;well this adverti&s;ement to a long preface. In general, the &s;tyle will too &s;urely declare the author. Not only his friends, but his bittere&s;t enemies (if he now has any enemies) will agree, that he is not to be imitated: he is, as Cowley &s;ays, "a va&s;t &s;pecies alone."</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="9">The fourth Letter, which was originally de&s;igned for the third, has been found com|plete, as it was fir&s;t written. The friends of the Author tru&s;t, that they &s;hall be able to pre&s;ent it to the Publick nearly as it came from his pen, with little more than &s;ome trifling alterations of temporary allu&s;ions to things now pa&s;t, and in this eventful cri&s;is, already ob&s;olete.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you for the bundle of State-papers, which I received ye&s;terday. I have travelled through the Negotiation; and a &s;ad, founderous road it is. There is a &s;ort of a &s;tanding je&s;t again&s;t my countrymen, that one of them on his journey having found a piece of plea&s;ant road, he propo&s;ed to his companion to go over it again. This pro|po&s;al, with regard to the worthy traveller's final de&s;tination, was certainly a blunder. It was no blunder as to his immediate &s;atisfaction; for the way was plea&s;ant. In the irk&s;ome journey of the Regicide negotiations, it is otherwi&s;e: <Q>Our paths are not paths of plea&s;antne&s;s, nor our ways the ways to peace.</Q> All our mi&s;takes (if &s;uch they are) like tho&s;e of our Hibernian traveller, are mi&s;|takes of repetition; and they will be full as far from bringing us to our place of re&s;t, as his well con&s;idered project was from forwarding him to his inn. Yet I &s;ee we per&s;evere. Fatigued with our former cour&s;e; too li&s;tle&s;s to explore a new one; kept in action by inertne&s;s; moving only becau&s;e we have been in motion; with a &s;ort of plodding
<PB N="2" REF="13">
per&s;everance, we re&s;olve to mea&s;ure back again the very &s;ame joyle&s;s, hopele&s;s, and inglorious track. Backward and forward; o&s;cillation not progre&s;&s;ion; much going in a &s;canty &s;pace; the travels of a po&s;tillion, miles enough to circle the globe in one &s;hort &s;tage; we have been, and we are yet to be jolted and rattled over the loo&s;e, mi&s;placed &s;tones, and the treacherous hollows of this rough, ill kept, broken up, treacherous French cau&s;e|way!</P>
<P>The Declaration, which brings up the rear of the papers laid before Parliament, contains a re|view and a rea&s;oned &s;ummary of all our attempts, and all our failures; a conci&s;e but correct narra|tive of the painful &s;teps taken to bring on the e&s;&s;ay of a treaty at Paris; a clear expo&s;ure of all the re|buffs we received in the progre&s;s of that experi|ment; an hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion of our departure from all the rules and all the principles of political ne|gotiation, and of common prudence, in the con|duct of it; and to crown the whole, a fair ac|count of the atrocious manner in which the Regi|cide enemies had broken up what had been &s;o in|au&s;piciou&s;ly begun and &s;o feebly carried on, by finally, and with all &s;corn, driving our &s;uppliant Amba&s;&s;ador out of the limits of their u&s;urpation.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="14">Even after all that I have lately &s;een, I was a little &s;urprized at this expo&s;ure. A minute di&s;play of hopes formed without foundation, and of la|bours pur&s;ued without fruit, is a thing not very flattering to &s;elf-e&s;timation. But truth has it's rights and it will a&s;&s;ert them. The Declaration, after doing all this with a mortifying candour, con|cludes the whole recapitulation with an engage|ment &s;till more extraordinary than all the unu&s;ual matter it contains. It &s;ays, <Q>That his Maje&s;ty, who had entered into this negotiation with <HI>good faith,</HI> who has &s;uffered <HI>no</HI> impediment to pre|vent his pro&s;ecuting it with <HI>earne&s;tne&s;s and &s;in|cerity,</HI> has now <HI>only to lament</HI> it's abrupt termi|nation, and to renew <HI>in the face of all Europe the &s;olemn declaration,</HI> that whenever his enemies &s;hall be <HI>di&s;po&s;ed</HI> to enter upon the work of a ge|neral pacification in a &s;pirit of conciliation and equity, nothing &s;hall be wanting on his part to contribute to the accompli&s;hment of that great object.</Q></P>
<P>If the di&s;gu&s;ting detail of the accumulated in|&s;ults we have received, in what we have very pro|perly called our "&s;olicitation," to a gang of felons and murderers, had been produced as a proof of the utter inefficacy of that mode of proceeding with that de&s;cription of per&s;ons, I &s;hould have no|thing at all to object to it. It might furni&s;h mat|ter
<PB N="4" REF="15">
conclu&s;ive in argument, and in&s;tructive in po|licy: but with all due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to high autho|rity, and with all decent deference to &s;uperiour lights, it does not &s;eem quite clear to a di&s;cern|ment no better than mine, that the premi&s;es in that piece conduct irre&s;i&s;tibly to the con|clu&s;ion. A laboured di&s;play of the ill con&s;e|quences which have attended an uniform cour&s;e of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to every mode of contumelious in&s;ult, with which the de&s;poti&s;m of a proud, capricious, in&s;ulting and implacable foe has cho&s;en to buffet our patience, does not appear, to my poor thoughts, to be properly brought forth as a preliminary to ju&s;tify a re&s;olution of per&s;evering in the very &s;ame kind of conduct, towards the very &s;ame &s;ort of per&s;on, and on the very &s;ame principles. We &s;tate our experience, and then we come to the manly re&s;olution of acting in contradiction to it. All that has pa&s;&s;ed at Paris, to the moment of our being &s;hamefully hi&s;&s;ed off that &s;tage, has been nothing but a more &s;olemn repre&s;entation, on the theatre of the nation, of what had been before in rehear&s;al at B&acirc;&s;le. As it is not only confe&s;&s;ed by us, but made a matter of charge on the enemy, that he had given us no encouragement to believe there was a change in his di&s;po&s;ition, or in his po|licy at any time &s;ub&s;equent to the period of his rejecting our fir&s;t overtures, there &s;eems to have been no a&s;&s;ignable motive for &s;ending Lord
<PB N="5" REF="16">
Malme&s;bury to Paris, except to expo&s;e his hum|bled country to the wor&s;t indignities and the fir&s;t of the kind, as the Declaration very truly ob|&s;erves, that have been known in the world of ne|gotiation.</P>
<P>An hone&s;t neighbour of mine is not altogether unhappy in the application of an old common &s;tory to a pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. It may be &s;aid of my friend, what Horace &s;ays of a neighbour of his, <Q>garrit aniles ex re fabellas.</Q> Conver&s;ing on this &s;trange &s;ubject, he told me a current &s;tory of a &s;imple En|gli&s;h country 'Squire, who was per&s;uaded by cer|tain <HI>dilettanti</HI> of his acquaintance to &s;ee the world, and to become knowing in men and manners. Among other celebrated places, it was recom|mended to him to vi&s;it Con&s;tantinople. He took their advice. After various adventures, not to our purpo&s;e to dwell upon, he happily arrived at that fa|mous city. As &s;oon as he had a little repo&s;ed him&s;elf from his fatigue, he took a walk into the &s;treets; but he had not gone far, before a <Q>malignant and a turban'd Turk</Q> had his choler rou&s;ed by the carele&s;s and a&s;&s;ured air, with which this infidel &s;trutted about in the metropolis of true believers. In this temper, he lo&s;t no time in doing to our traveller the honours of the place. The Turk cro&s;&s;ed over the way, and with perfect good-will gave him two or three lu&s;ty kicks on the &s;eat of
<PB N="6" REF="17">
honour. To re&s;ent, or to return the compliment in Turkey, was quite out of the que&s;tion. Our traveller, &s;ince he could not otherwi&s;e acknow|ledge this kind of favour, received it with the be&s;t grace in the world&mdash;he made one of his mo&s;t ceremonious bows, and begged the kicking Mu&s;|&s;ulman, <Q>to accept his perfect a&s;&s;urances of high con&s;ideration.</Q> Our countryman was too wi&s;e to imitate Othello in the u&s;e of the dagger. He thought it better, as better it was, to a&s;&s;uage his brui&s;ed dignity with half a yard &s;quare of balmy diplomatick diachylon. In the di&s;a&s;ters of their friends, people are &s;eldom wanting in a laudable patience. When they are &s;uch as do not threaten to end fatally, they become even matter of plea|&s;antry. The Engli&s;h fellow-travellers of our &s;uf|ferer, finding him a little out of &s;pirits, entreated him not to take &s;o &s;light a bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o very &s;eri|ou&s;ly. They told him it was the cu&s;tom of the country; that every country had it's cu&s;toms; that the Turki&s;h manners were a little rough; but that in the main the Turks were a good-natured people; that what would have been a deadly affront any where el&s;e, was only a little freedom there; in &s;hort, they told him to think no more of the matter, and to try his fortune in another <HI>promenade.</HI> But the 'Squire, though a little clowni&s;h, had &s;ome home|bred &s;en&s;e. What! have I come, at all this expence and trouble, all the way to Con&s;tantinople only to
<PB N="7" REF="18">
be kicked? Without going beyond my own &s;ta|ble, my groom, for half a crown, would have kicked me to my heart's content. I don't mean to &s;tay in Con&s;tantinople eight and forty hours, nor ever to return to this rough, good-natured people, that have their own cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>In my opinion the 'Squire was in the right. He was &s;atisfied with his fir&s;t ramble and his fir&s;t injuries. But rea&s;on of &s;tate and common-&s;en&s;e are two things. If it were not for this difference, it might not appear of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, after having received a certain quantity of buffetings by ad|vance, that we &s;hould &s;end a Peer of the realm to the &s;cum of the earth, to collect the debt to the la&s;t farthing; and to receive, with infinite aggra|vation, the &s;ame &s;corns which had been paid to our &s;upplication through a Commoner: But it was proper, I &s;uppo&s;e, that the whole of our coun|try, in all it's orders, &s;hould have a &s;hare of the indignity; and, as in rea&s;on, that the higher or|ders &s;hould touch the larger proportion.</P>
<P>This bu&s;ine&s;s was not ended, becau&s;e our dig|nity was wounded, or becau&s;e our patience was worn out with contumely and &s;corn. We had not di&s;gorged one particle of the nau&s;eous do&s;es with which we were &s;o liberally crammed by the mountebanks of Paris, in order to drug and diet us
<PB N="8" REF="19">
into perfect tamene&s;s. No; we waited, till the mor|bid &s;trength of our <HI>boulimia</HI> for their phy&s;ick had ex|hau&s;ted the well-&s;tored di&s;pen&s;ary of their empiri|ci&s;m. It is impo&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s at the term to which our forbearance would have extended. The Regi|cides were more fatigued with giving blows than the callous cheek of Briti&s;h Diplomacy was hurt in receiving them. They had no way left for getting rid of this mendicant per&s;everance, but by &s;ending for the Beadle, and forcibly driving our Emba&s;&s;y 'of &s;hreds and patches,' with all it's mumping cant, from the inho&s;pitable door of Can|nibal Ca&s;tle&mdash;
<Q><L>"Where the gaunt ma&s;tiff, growling at the gate,</L>
<L>"Affrights the beggar whom he longs to eat."</L></Q></P>
<P>I think we might have found, before the rude hand of in&s;olent office was on our &s;houlder, and the &s;taff of u&s;urped authority brandi&s;hed over our heads, that contempt of the &s;uppliant is not the be&s;t forwarder of a &s;uit; that national di&s;grace is not the high road to &s;ecurity, much le&s;s to power and greatne&s;s. Patience, indeed, &s;trongly indicates the love of peace: But mere love does not always lead to enjoyment. It is the power of winning that palm which in&s;ures our wearing it. Virtues have their place; and out of their place they hardly de&s;erve the name. They pa&s;s into the neighbour|ing vice. The patience of fortitude, and the en|durance
<PB N="9" REF="20">
of pu&s;illanimity are things very different, as in their principle, &s;o in their effects.</P>
<P>In truth this Declaration, containing a narra|tive of the fir&s;t tran&s;action of the kind (and I hope it will be the la&s;t) in the intercour&s;e of nations, as a compo&s;ition, is ably drawn. It does credit to our official &s;tyle. The report of the Speech of the Mini&s;ter in a great A&s;&s;embly, which I have read, is a comment upon the Declaration. With|out enquiry how far that report is exact, (inferior I believe it may be to what it would repre&s;ent,) yet &s;till it reads as a mo&s;t eloquent and fini&s;hed performance. Hardly one galling circum&s;tance of the indignities offered by the Directory of Regi|cide, to the &s;upplications made to that junto in his Maje&s;ty's name, has been &s;pared. Every one of the aggravations attendant on the&s;e acts of out|rage is, with wonderful per&s;picuity and order, brought forward in it's place, and in the manner mo&s;t fitted to produce it's effect. They are turned to every point of view in which they can be &s;een to the be&s;t advantage. All the parts are &s;o arranged as to point out their relation, and to furni&s;h a true idea of the &s;pirit of the whole tran&s;action.</P>
<P>This Speech may &s;tand for a model. Never, for the triumphal decoration of any theatre, not
<PB N="10" REF="21">
for the decoration of tho&s;e of Athens and Rome, or even of this theatre of Paris, from the em|broideries of Babylon or from the loom of the Gobelins, has there been &s;ent any hi&s;torick ti&s;|&s;ue, &s;o truly drawn, &s;o clo&s;ely and &s;o finely wrought, or in which the forms are brought out in the rich purple of &s;uch glowing and blu&s;hing colours. It puts me in mind of the piece of ta|pe&s;try, with which Virgil propo&s;ed to adorn the theatre he was to erect to Augu&s;tus, upon the banks of the Mincio, who now hides his head in his reeds, and leads his &s;low and melancholy wind|ings through banks wa&s;ted by the barbarians of Gaul. He &s;uppo&s;es that the artifice is &s;uch, that the figures of the conquered nations in his tape&s;try are made to play their part, and are confounded in the machine:
<Q><L>&mdash;&mdash;utque</L>
<L>"Purpurea intexti tollant aulaea Britanni;"</L></Q>
Or as Dryden tran&s;lates it &s;omewhat paraphra&s;ti|cally, but not le&s;s in the &s;pirit of the Prophet than of the Poet,
<Q><L>Where the proud theatres di&s;clo&s;e the &s;cene,</L>
<L>Which, interwoven, Britons &s;eem to rai&s;e,</L>
<L>And &s;how the triumph which their &s;hame di&s;plays.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is &s;omething wonderful, that the &s;agacity &s;hown in the Declaration and the Speech (and, &s;o
<PB N="11" REF="22">
far as it goes, greater was never &s;hown) &s;hould have failed to di&s;cover to the writer and to the &s;peaker, the in&s;eparable relation between the par|ties to this tran&s;action; and that nothing can be &s;aid to di&s;play the imperious arrogance of a ba&s;e ene|my, which does not de&s;cribe with equal force and equal truth the contemptible figure of an abject emba&s;&s;y to that imperious Power.</P>
<P>It is no le&s;s &s;triking, that the &s;ame obvious reflexion &s;hould not occur to tho&s;e gentlemen who conducted the oppo&s;ition to Government. But their thoughts were turned another way. They &s;eem to have been &s;o entirely occupied with the defence of the French Directory, &s;o very eager in finding recriminatory precedents to ju&s;tify every act of it's intolerable in&s;olence, &s;o animated in their accu&s;ations of Mini&s;try for not having, at the very out&s;et, made conce&s;|&s;ions proportioned to the dignity of the great victorious Power we had offended, that every thing concerning the &s;acrifice in this bu&s;ine&s;s of national honour, and of the mo&s;t fundamental principles in the policy of negotiation, &s;eemed wholly to have e&s;caped them. To this fatal hour, the contention in Parliament appeared in another form, and was animated by another &s;pirit. For three hundred years and more, we have had wars with what &s;tood as Government in France. In all
<PB N="12" REF="23">
that period the language of Mini&s;ters, whether of boa&s;t or of apology, was, that they had left nothing undone for the a&s;&s;ertion of the national honour; the Oppo&s;ition, whether patriotically or factiou&s;ly, con|tending, that the Mini&s;ters had been oblivious of the national glory, and had made improper &s;acrifices of that publick intere&s;t, which they were bound not only to pre&s;erve, but by all fair methods to augment. This total change of tone on both &s;ides of your hou&s;e, forms it&s;elf no incon&s;iderable revolution; and I am afraid it progno&s;ticates others of &s;till greater importance. The Mini&s;ters exhau&s;ted the &s;tores of their eloquence in demon&s;trating, that they had quitted the &s;afe, beaten high-way of trea|ty between independent Powers; that to pacify the enemy they had made every &s;acrifice of the national dignity; and that they had offered to im|molate at the &s;ame &s;hrine the mo&s;t valuable of the national acqui&s;itions. The Oppo&s;ition in&s;i&s;ted, that the victims were not fat nor fair enough to be of|fered on the altars of bla&s;phemed Regicide; and it was inferred from thence, that the &s;acrifical mini&s;ters, (who were a &s;ort of intruders in the wor&s;hip of the new divinity) in their &s;chi&s;mati|cal devotion had di&s;covered more of hypocri&s;y than zeal. They charged them with a concealed re|&s;olution to per&s;evere in what the&s;e gentlemen have (in perfect con&s;i&s;tency, indeed, with them&s;elves,
<PB N="13" REF="24">
but mo&s;t irreconcileably with fact and rea&s;on) called an unju&s;t and impolitick war.</P>
<P>That day was, I fear, the fatal term of <HI>local</HI> pa|trioti&s;m. On that day, I fear, there was an end of that narrow &s;cheme of relations called our country, with all it's pride, it's prejudices, and it's partial affections. All the little quiet rivulets that water|ed an humble, a contracted, but not an unfruitful field, are to be lo&s;t in the wa&s;te expan&s;e, and boundle&s;s, barren ocean of the homicide philan|thropy of France. It is no longer an object of terror, the aggrandizement of a new power, which teaches as a profe&s;&s;or that philanthropy in the chair; whil&s;t it propagates by arms, and e&s;tabli&s;hes by conque&s;t, the comprehen&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of univer&s;al fraternity. In what light is all this viewed in a great a&s;&s;embly? The party which takes the lead there has no longer any apprehen&s;ions, except tho&s;e that ari&s;e from not being admitted to the clo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t confidential connexions with the metropolis of that fraternity. That reigning party no longer touches on it's favourite &s;ubject, the display of tho&s;e horrours that mu&s;t attend the exi&s;tence of a power, with &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions and principles, &s;eated in the heart of Europe. It is &s;atisfied to find &s;ome loo&s;e, ambiguous expre&s;&s;ions in it's former declarations, which may &s;et it free from it's pro|fe&s;&s;ions
<PB N="14" REF="25">
and engagements. It always &s;peaks of peace with the Regicides as a great and an un|doubted ble&s;&s;ing; and &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing, as if ob|tained, promi&s;es, as much as any human di&s;po&s;ition of things can promi&s;e, &s;ecurity and permanence. It holds out nothing at all definite towards this &s;ecurity. It only &s;eeks, by a re&s;toration, to &s;ome of their former owners, of &s;ome fragments of the general wreck of Europe, to find a plau&s;ible plea for a pre&s;ent retreat from an embarra&s;|&s;ing po&s;ition. As to the future, that party is con|tent to leave it, covered in a night of the mo&s;t palpable ob&s;curity. It never once has entered into a particle of detail of what our own &s;ituation, or that of other Powers mu&s;t be, under the ble&s;&s;ings of the peace we &s;eek. This defect, to my power, I mean to &s;upply; that if any per&s;ons &s;hould &s;till continue to think an attempt at fore&s;ight is any part of the duty of a State&s;man, I may contri|bute my trifle to the materials of his &s;peculation.</P>
<P>As to the other party, the minority of to-day, po&s;&s;ibly the majority of to-morrow, &s;mall in num|ber, but full of talents and every &s;pecies of energy, which, upon the avowed ground of being more acceptable to France, is a candidate for the helm of this kingdom, it has never changed from the beginning. It has pre&s;erved a perennial con&s;i&s;t|ency. This would be a never-failing &s;ource of
<PB N="15" REF="26">
true glory, if &s;pringing from ju&s;t and right; but it is truly dreadful if it be an arm of Styx, which &s;prings out of the profounde&s;t depths of a poi&s;oned &s;oil. The French maxims were by the&s;e gentlemen at no time condemned. I &s;peak of their language in the mo&s;t moderate terms. There are many who think that they have gone much fur|ther; that they have always magnified and extol|led the French maxims; that not in the lea&s;t di&s;|gu&s;ted or di&s;couraged by the mon&s;trous evils, which have attended the&s;e maxims from the moment of their adoption, both at home and abroad, they &s;till continue to predict, that in due time they mu&s;t produce the greate&s;t good to the poor hu|man race. They ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in &s;tating tho&s;e evils as matter of accident; as things wholly colla|teral to the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved, that this party has never &s;poken of an ally of Great Britain with the &s;malle&s;t degree of re&s;pect or regard; on the contrary, it has gene|rally mentioned them under opprobrious appella|tions, and in &s;uch terms of contempt or execra|tion, as never had been heard before, becau&s;e no &s;uch would have formerly been permitted in our public a&s;&s;emblies. The moment, however, that any of tho&s;e allies quitted this obnoxious connexion, the party has in&s;tantly pa&s;&s;ed an act of indemnity and oblivion in their favour. After
<PB N="16" REF="27">
this, no &s;ort of cen&s;ure on their conduct; no im|putation on their character! From that moment their pardon was &s;ealed in a reverential and my&s;te|rious &s;ilence. With the Gentlemen of this mino|rity, there is no ally, from one end of Europe to the other, with whom we ought not to be a&s;hamed to act. The whole College of the States of Eu|rope is no better than a gang of tyrants. With them all our connexions were broken off at once. We ought to have cultivated France, and France alone, from the moment of her Revolution. On that happy change, all our dread of that nation as a power was to cea&s;e. She became in an in&s;tant dear to our affections, and one with our intere&s;ts. All other nations we ought to have commanded not to trouble her &s;acred throes, whil&s;t in la|bour to bring into an happy birth her abundant litter of con&s;titutions. We ought to have acted under her au&s;pices, in extending her &s;alutary in|fluence upon every &s;ide. From that moment England and France were become natural allies, and all the other States natural enemies. The whole face of the world was changed. What was it to us if &s;he acquired Holland and the Au&s;trian Netherlands? By her conque&s;ts &s;he only enlarged the &s;phere of her beneficence; &s;he only extended the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty to &s;o many more fooli&s;hly reluctant nations. What was it to England, if by adding the&s;e, among the riche&s;t and mo&s;t peopled
<PB N="17" REF="28">
countries of the world, to her territories, &s;he there|by left no po&s;&s;ible link of communication between us and any other Power with whom we could act again&s;t her? On this new &s;y&s;tem of optimi&s;m, it is &s;o much the better;&mdash;&s;o much the further are we removed from the contact with infectious de&s;|poti&s;m. No longer a thought of a barrier in the Netherlands to Holland again&s;t France. All that is ob&s;olete policy. It is fit that France &s;hould have both Holland and the Au&s;trian Netherlands too, as a barrier to her again&s;t the attacks of de&s;poti&s;m. She cannot multiply her &s;ecurities too much; and as to our &s;ecurity, it is to be found in her's. Had we cheri&s;hed her from the beginning, and felt for her when attacked, &s;he, poor good &s;oul, would never have invaded any foreign nation; never murdered her Sovereign and his family; never pro&s;cribed, never exiled, never impri&s;oned, never been guilty of extrajudicial ma&s;&s;acre, or of legal murder. All would have been a golden age, full of peace, order, and liberty! and philo&s;ophy, ray|ing out from Europe, would have warmed and en|lightened the univer&s;e: but unluckily, irritable philo&s;ophy, the mo&s;t irritable of all things, was put into a pa&s;&s;ion, and provoked into ambition abroad and tyranny at home. They find all this very natural and very ju&s;tifiable. They chu&s;e to forget, that other nations &s;truggling for freedom, have been attacked by their neighbours; or that
<PB N="18" REF="29">
their neigbours have otherwi&s;e interfered in their affairs. Often have neighbours interfered in fa|vour of Princes again&s;t their rebellious &s;ubjects; and often in favour of &s;ubjects again&s;t their Prince. Such ca&s;es fill half the pages of hi&s;tory, yet never were they u&s;ed as an apology, much le&s;s as a ju&s;|tification, for atrocious cruelty in Princes, or for general ma&s;&s;acre and confi&s;cation on the part of revolted &s;ubjects; never as a politick cau&s;e for &s;uf|fering any &s;uch powers to aggrandize them&s;elves without limit and without mea&s;ure. A thou&s;and times have we &s;een it a&s;&s;erted in publick prints and pamphlets, that if the nobility and prie&s;thood of France had &s;taid at home, their property ne|ver would have been confi&s;cated. One would think that none of the clergy had been rob|bed previous to their deportation, or that their deportation had, on their part, been a volun|tary act. One would think that the nobility and gentry, and merchants and bankers, who &s;taid at home, had enjoyed their property in &s;ecurity and repo&s;e. The a&s;&s;ertors of the&s;e po&s;itions well know, that the lot of thou&s;ands who remained at home was far more terrible; that the mo&s;t cruel im|pri&s;onment was only a harbinger of a cruel and ignominious death; and that in this mother coun|try of freedom, there were no le&s;s than <HI>Three Hun|dred Thousand</HI> at one time in pri&s;on. I go no further. I in&s;tance only the&s;e repre&s;entations of
<PB N="19" REF="30">
the party as &s;taring indications of partiality to that &s;ect, to who&s;e dominion they would have left this country nothing to oppo&s;e but her own naked force, and con&s;equently &s;ubjected us, on every rever&s;e of fortune, to the imminent danger of fal|ling under tho&s;e very evils in that very &s;y&s;tem, which are attributed, not to it's own nature, but to the perver&s;ene&s;s of others. There is nothing in the world &s;o difficult as to put men in a &s;tate of judicial neutrality. A leaning there mu&s;t ever be, and it is of the fir&s;t importance to any nation to ob&s;erve to what &s;ide that leaning inclines&mdash; whether to our own community or to one with which it is in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility.</P>
<P>Men are rarely without &s;ome &s;ympathy in the &s;ufferings of others; but in the immen&s;e and di|ver&s;ified ma&s;s of human mi&s;ery, which may be pi|tied, but cannot be relieved, in the gro&s;s, the mind mu&s;t make a choice. Our &s;ympathy is always more forcibly attracted towards the misfortunes of certain per&s;ons, and in certain de&s;criptions: and this &s;ympathetic attraction di&s;covers, beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;take, our mental affinities, and elec|tive affections. It is a much &s;urer proof, than the &s;tronge&s;t declaration, of a real connexion and of an over-ruling bias in the mind. I am told that the active &s;ympathies of this party have been chiefly, if not wholly attracted to the &s;ufferings of the pa|triarchal

rebels, who were among&s;t the promulga|tors of the maxims of the French Revolution, and who have &s;uffered, from their apt and forward &s;cho|lars, &s;ome part of the evils, which they had them|&s;elves &s;o liberally di&s;tributed to all the other parts of the community. Some of the&s;e men, flying from the knives which they had &s;harpened again&s;t their country and it's laws, rebelling again&s;t the very powers they had &s;et over them&s;elves by their rebel|lion again&s;t their Sovereign, given up by tho&s;e very armies to who&s;e faithful attachment they tru&s;ted for their &s;afety and &s;upport, after they had compleatly debauched all military fidelity in it's &s;ource; &s;ome of the&s;e men, I &s;ay, had fallen into the hands of the head of that family, the mo&s;t illu&s;|trious per&s;on of which they had three times cruelly impri&s;oned, and delivered in that &s;tate of captivity to tho&s;e hands, from which they were able to re|lieve, neither her, nor their own neare&s;t and mo&s;t venerable kindred. One of the&s;e men, con|nected with this country by no circum&s;tance of birth; not related to any di&s;tingui&s;hed families here; recommended by no &s;ervice; endeared to this nation by no act or even expre&s;&s;ion of kind|ne&s;s; comprehended in no league or common cau&s;e; embraced by no laws of publick ho&s;pitality; this man was the only one to be found in Eu|rope, in who&s;e favour the Briti&s;h nation, pa&s;&s;ing judgment, without hearing, on it's almo&s;t only ally,

was to force, (and that not by &s;oothing interpo&s;i|tion, but with every reproach for inhumanity, cruelty, and breach of the laws of war,) from pri&s;on. We were to relea&s;e him from that pri|&s;on out of which, in abu&s;e of the lenity of Go|vernment amid&s;t it's rigour, and in violation of at lea&s;t an under&s;tood parole, he had attempted an e&s;cape; an e&s;cape excu&s;eable if you will, but na|turally productive of &s;trict and vigilant confine|ment. The earne&s;tne&s;s of gentlemen to free this per&s;on was the more extraordinary, becau&s;e there was full as little in him to rai&s;e admiration, from any eminent qualities he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as there was to ex|cite an intere&s;t, from any that were amiable. A per&s;on, not only of no real civil or literary talents, but of no &s;pecious appearance of either; and in his military profe&s;&s;ion, not marked as a leader in any one act of able or &s;ucce&s;sful enterprize &mdash;unle&s;s his leading on (or his following) the al|lied army of Amazonian and male cannibal Pari|&s;ians to Ver&s;ailles, on the famous fifth of October, 1789, is to make his glory. Any other exploit of his, as a General, I never heard of. But the triumph of general fraternity was but the more &s;ignalized by the total want of particular claims in that ca&s;e; and by po&s;tponing all &s;uch claims, in a ca&s;e where they really exi&s;ted, where they &s;tood embo&s;&s;ed, and in a manner forced them&s;elves on the view of com|mon &s;hort-&s;ighted benevolence. Whil&s;t, for its im|provement,
<PB N="22" REF="33">
the humanity of the&s;e gentlemen was thus on it's travels, and had got as far off as Ol|mutz, they never thought of a place and a per&s;on much nearer to them, or of moving an in&s;truction to Lord Malme&s;bury in favour of their own &s;uffer|ing countryman, Sir Sydney Smith.</P>
<P>This officer, having attempted, with great gal|lantry, to cut out a ve&s;&s;el from one of the enemy's harbours, was taken after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance; &s;uch as obtained him the marked re&s;pect of tho&s;e who were witne&s;&s;es of his valour, and knew the circum&s;tances in which it was di&s;played. Upon his arrival at Paris, he was in&s;tantly thrown into pri&s;on; where the nature of his &s;ituation will be&s;t be under&s;tood, by knowing, that among&s;t its <HI>miti|gations,</HI> was the permi&s;&s;ion to walk occa&s;ionally in the court, and to enjoy the privilege of &s;having him&s;elf. On the old &s;y&s;tem of feelings and prin|ciples, his &s;ufferings might have been entitled to con&s;ideration; and even in a compari&s;on with tho&s;e of Citizen la Fayette, to a priority in the order of compa&s;&s;ion. If the Mini&s;ters had neglected to take any &s;teps in his favour, a declaration of the &s;en&s;e of the Hou&s;e of Commons would have &s;timulated them to their duty. If they had cau&s;ed a repre|&s;entation to be made, &s;uch a proceeding would have added force to it. If repri&s;al &s;hould be thought advi&s;eable, the addre&s;s of the Hou&s;e would

have given an additional &s;anction to a mea&s;ure, which would have been, indeed, ju&s;tifiable with|out any other &s;anction than it's own rea&s;on. But no. Nothing at all like it. In fact, the merit of Sir Sydney Smith, and his claim on Briti&s;h com|pa&s;&s;ion, was of a kind altogether different from that which intere&s;ted &s;o deeply the authors of the motion in favour of Citizen la Fayette. In my humble opinion, Captain Sir Sydney Smith has another &s;ort of merit with the Briti&s;h nation, and &s;omething of a higher claim on Briti&s;h humanity than Citizen de la Fayette. Faithful, zealous, and ardent in the &s;ervice of his King and Country; full of &s;pirit; full of re&s;ources; going out of the beaten road, but going right, becau&s;e his uncommon enterprize was not conducted by a vulgar judgment;&mdash;in his profe&s;&s;ion, Sir Sydney Smith might be con&s;idered as a di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;on, if any per&s;on could well be di&s;tingui&s;hed in a &s;ervice in which &s;carce a Commander can be named without putting you in mind of &s;ome action of intrepidity, &s;kill, and vigilance, that has given them a fair title to con|tend with any men and in any age. But I will &s;ay nothing farther of the merits of Sir Sydney Smith: The mortal animo&s;ity of the Regicide enemy &s;u|per&s;edes all other panegyrick. Their hatred is a judgment in his favour without appeal. At pre&s;ent he is lodged in the tower of the Temple, the la&s;t pri&s;on of Louis the Sixteenth, and the la&s;t but one
<PB N="24" REF="35">
of Maria Antonietta of Au&s;tria; the pri&s;on of Louis the Seventeenth; the pri&s;on of Elizabeth of Bour|bon. There he lies, unpitied by the grand philan|thropy, to meditate upon the fate of tho&s;e who are faithful to their King and Country. Whil&s;t this pri&s;oner, &s;ecluded from intercour&s;e, was in|dulging in the&s;e cheering reflections, he might po&s;&s;ibly have had the further con&s;olation of learn|ing (by means of the in&s;olent exultation of his guards) that there was an Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador at Paris; he might have had the proud comfort of hearing, that this Amba&s;&s;ador had the honour of pa&s;&s;ing his mornings in re&s;pectful attendance at the office of a Regicide pettifogger; and that in the evening he relaxed in the amu&s;ements of the opera, and in the &s;pectacle of an audience totally new; an audience in which he had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing about him not a &s;ingle face that he could formerly have known in Paris; but in the place of that company, one indeed more than equal to it in di&s;play of gaiety, &s;plendour and luxury; a &s;et of abandoned wretches, &s;quandering in in&s;olent riot the &s;poils of their bleeding country. A &s;ubject of profound reflection both to the pri&s;oner and to the Amba&s;&s;ador.</P>

had the opportunity of a nearer view of it's con|duct, and who have been more attentive in their peru&s;al of the writings, which have appeared in it's favour. But for my part, I have never heard the gro&s;s facts on which I ground my idea of their marked partiality to the reigning Tyranny in France, in any part, denied. I am not &s;urprized at all this. Opinions, as they &s;ometimes follow, &s;o they frequently guide and direct the affections; and men may become more attached to the country of their principles, than to the country of their birth. What I have &s;tated here is only to mark the &s;pirit which &s;eems to me, though in &s;omewhat different ways, to actuate our great party-leaders; and to trace this fir&s;t pattern of a negotiation to it's true &s;ource.</P>
<P>Such is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our publick councils. Well might I be a&s;hamed of what &s;eems to be a cen&s;ure of two great factions, with the two mo&s;t eloquent men, which this country ever &s;aw, at the head of them, if I had found that either of them could &s;upport their conduct by any example in the hi&s;tory of their country. I &s;hould very much prefer their judgment to my own, if I were not ob|liged, by an infinitely overbalancing weight of authority, to prefer the collected wi&s;dom of ages to the abilities of any two men living.

the Declaration, with which the hi&s;tory of the abor|tion of a treaty with the Regicides is clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>After &s;uch an elaborate di&s;play had been made of the inju&s;tice and in&s;olence of an enemy, who &s;eems to have been irritated by every one of the means, which had been commonly u&s;ed with effect to &s;oothe the rage of intemperate power, the na|tural re&s;ult would be, that the &s;cabbard, in which we in vain attempted to plunge our &s;word, &s;hould have been thrown away with &s;corn.

he found his &s;ituation full of danger, (and I do not deny that it is perilous in the extreme) he mu&s;t feel that it is al&s;o full of glory; and that he is placed on a &s;tage, than which no Mu&s;e of fire that had a&s;cended the highe&s;t heaven of in|vention, could imagine any thing more awful and augu&s;t. It was hoped, that in this &s;welling &s;cene, in which he moved with &s;ome of the fir&s;t Poten|tates of Europe for his fellow actors, and with &s;o many of the re&s;t for the anxious &s;pectators of a part, which, as he plays it, determines for ever their de&s;tiny and his own, like Uly&s;&s;es, in the un|ravelling point of the epic &s;tory, he would have thrown off his patience and his rags together; and &s;tripped of unworthy di&s;gui&s;es, he would have &s;tood forth in the form, and in the attitude of an hero. On that day, it was thought he would have a&s;&s;umed the port of Mars; that he would bid to be brought forth from their hideous kennel (where his &s;crupulous tenderne&s;s had too long immured them) tho&s;e impatient dogs of war, who&s;e fierce regards affright even the Mini&s;ter of Vengeance that feeds them; that he would let them loo&s;e, in famine, fever, plagues, and death, upon a guilty race, to who&s;e frame, and to all who&s;e habit, order, peace, religion, and virtue, are alien and abhorrent. It was expected that he would at la&s;t have thought of active and effec|tual war; that he would no longer amu&s;e the

Briti&s;h Lion in the chace of mice and rats; that he would no longer employ the whole naval power of Great Britain, once the terrour of the world, to prey upon the mi&s;erable remains of a pedling commerce, which the enemy did not re|gard, and from which none could profit. It was expected that he would have re-a&s;&s;erted the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e; that he would have re-ani|mated whatever remained to him of his allies, and endeavoured to recover tho&s;e whom their fears had led a&s;tray; that he would have re|kindled the martial ardour of his citizens; that he would have held out to them the example of their ance&s;try, the a&s;&s;ertor of Europe, and the &s;courge of French ambition; that he would have reminded them of a po&s;terity, which if this nefa|rious robbery, under the fraudulent name and fal&s;e colour of a government, &s;hould in full power be &s;eated in the heart of Europe, mu&s;t for ever be con&s;igned to vice, impiety, barbari&s;m, and the mo&s;t ignominious &s;lavery of body and mind. In &s;o holy a cau&s;e it was pre&s;umed, that he would, (as in the beginning of the war he did) have opened all the temples; and with prayer, with fa&s;ting, and with &s;upplication (better directed than to the grim Moloch of Regicide in France), have called upon us to rai&s;e that united cry, which has &s;o often &s;tormed Heaven, and with a pious violence forced down ble&s;&s;ings upon a repentant people.

<P>Such a conclu&s;ion to &s;uch a Declaration and &s;uch a Speech, would have been a thing of cour&s;e; &s;o much a thing of cour&s;e, that I will be bold to &s;ay, if in any ancient hi&s;tory, the Roman for in&s;tance, (&s;uppo&s;ing that in Rome the matter of &s;uch a detail could have been furni&s;hed) a Con&s;ul had gone through &s;uch a long train of proceed|ings, and that there was a cha&s;m in the manu&s;cripts by which we had lo&s;t the conclu&s;ion of the &s;peech and the &s;ub&s;equent part of the narrative, all cri|ticks would agree, that a <HI>Frein&s;hemius</HI> would have been thought to have managed the &s;upplementary bu&s;ine&s;s of a continuator mo&s;t un&s;kilfully, and to have &s;upplied the hiatus mo&s;t improbably, if he had not filled up the gaping &s;pace, in a manner &s;ome|what &s;imilar, (though better executed) to what I have imagined. But too often different is ra|tional conjecture from melancholy fact. This exordium, as contrary to all the rules of rhetorick, as to tho&s;e more e&s;&s;ential rules of policy which
<PB N="30" REF="41">
our &s;ituation would dictate, is intended as a pre|lude to a deadening and di&s;heartening propo&s;i|tion; as if all that a Mini&s;ter had to fear in a war of his own conducting, was, that the people &s;hould pur&s;ue it with too ardent a zeal. Such a tone, as I gue&s;&s;ed the Mini&s;ter would have taken, I am very &s;ure, is the true, un&s;uborned, un&s;ophi&s;ti|cated language of genuine natural feeling under the &s;mart of patience exhau&s;ted and abu&s;ed. Such a conduct as the facts &s;tated in the Declaration gave room to expect, is that which true wi&s;dom would have dictated under the impre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e ge|nuine feelings. Never was there a jar or di&s;cord, be|tween genuine &s;entiment and &s;ound policy. Never, no, never, did Nature &s;ay one thing and Wi&s;dom &s;ay another. Nor are &s;entiments of elevation in them|&s;elves turgid and unnatural. Nature is never more truly her&s;elf, than in her grande&s;t forms. The Apollo of Belvedere (if the univer&s;al robber has yet left him at Belvedere) is as much in Nature, as any figure from the pencil of Rembrandt, or any clown in the ru&s;tic revels of Teniers. Indeed it is when a great nation is in great difficulties, that minds mu&s;t exalt them&s;elves to the occa&s;ion, or all is lo&s;t. Strong pa&s;&s;ion under the direction of a feeble rea&s;on feeds a low fever, which &s;erves only to de&s;troy the body that entertains it. But ve|hement pa&s;&s;ion does not always indicate an infirm judgment. It often accompanies, and actuates, and
<PB N="31" REF="42">
is even auxiliary to a powerful under&s;tanding; and when they both con&s;pire and act harmoniou&s;ly, their force is great to de&s;troy di&s;order within, and to repel injury from abroad. If ever there was a time that calls on us for no vulgar conception of things, and for exertions in no vulgar &s;train, it is the aw|ful hour that Providence has now appointed to this nation. Every little mea&s;ure is a great errour; and every great errour will bring on no &s;mall ruin. No|thing can be directed above the mark that we mu&s;t aim at: Every thing below it is ab&s;olutely thrown away.</P>
<P>Except with the addition of the unheard-of in|&s;ult offered to our Amba&s;&s;ador by his rude expul|&s;ion, we are never to forget that the point on which the negotiation with De la Croix broke off, was exactly that which had &s;tifled in it's cradle the negotiation we had attempted with Barth&eacute;l&eacute;my. Each of the&s;e tran&s;actions, concluded with a ma|nife&s;to upon our part: but the la&s;t of our manife&s;|toes very materially differed from the fir&s;t. The fir&s;t Declaration &s;tated, that <Q><HI>nothing was left</HI> but to pro&s;ecute a war <HI>equally ju&s;t and nece&s;|&s;ary.</HI></Q> In the &s;econd, the ju&s;tice and ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the war is dropped: The &s;entence im|porting that nothing was left but the pro&s;ecu|tion of &s;uch a war, di&s;appears al&s;o. In&s;tead of this re&s;olution to pro&s;ecute the war, we &s;ink
<PB N="32" REF="43">
into a whining lamentation on the abrupt termi|nation of the treaty. We have nothing left but the la&s;t re&s;ource of female weakne&s;s, of helple&s;s infancy, of doting decrepitude,&mdash;wailing and la|mentation. We cannot even utter a &s;entiment of vigour&mdash;"his Maje&s;ty has only to lament." A poor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to be left to a great Mo|narch! Mark the effect produced on our coun|cils by continued in&s;olence, and inveterate ho&s;|tility! We grow more malleable under their blows. In reverential &s;ilence, we &s;mother the cau&s;e and origin of the war. On that funda|mental article of faith, we leave every one to abound in his own &s;en&s;e. In the Mini&s;ter's &s;peech, glo&s;&s;ing on the Declaration, it is indeed mentioned; but very feebly. The lines are &s;o faintly drawn as hardly to be traced. They only make a part of our <HI>con&s;olation</HI> in the circum&s;tances which we &s;o dolefully lament. We re&s;t our merits on the humility, the earne&s;tne&s;s of &s;olicita|tion, and the perfect good faith of tho&s;e &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ions, which have been u&s;ed to per&s;uade our Re|gicide enemies to grant us &s;ome &s;ort of peace. Not a word is &s;aid, which might not have been full as well &s;aid, and much better too, if the Bri|ti&s;h nation had appeared in the &s;imple character of a penitent convinced of his errours and offences, and offering, by penances, by pilgrimages, and by all the modes of expiation ever devi&s;ed by anxious,
<PB N="33" REF="44">
re&s;tle&s;s guilt, to make all the atonement in his mi&s;erable power.</P>
<P>The Declaration ends as I have before quoted it, with a &s;olemn voluntary pledge, the mo&s;t full and the mo&s;t &s;olemn that ever was given, of our re&s;olu|tion (if &s;o it may be called) to enter again into the very &s;ame cour&s;e. It requires nothing more of the Regicides, than to furni&s;h &s;ome &s;ort of excu&s;e, &s;ome &s;ort of colourable pretext, for our renewing the &s;up|plications of innocence at the feet of guilt. It leaves the moment of negotiation, a mo&s;t im|portant moment, to the choice of the enemy. He is to regulate it according to the convenience of his affairs. He is to bring it forward at that time when it may be&s;t &s;erve to e&s;tabli&s;h his autho|rity at home, and to extend his power abroad. A dangerous a&s;&s;urance for this nation to give, whether it is broken or whether it is kept. As all treaty was broken off, and broken off in the manner we have &s;een, the field of future conduct ought to be re&s;erved free and unincumbered to our future di&s;cretion. As to the &s;ort of condition prefixed to the pledge, namely, <Q>that the enemy &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to enter into the work of general pacification with the &s;pirit of reconciliation and equity,</Q> this phra&s;eology cannot po&s;&s;ibly be con|&s;idered otherwi&s;e, than as &s;o many words thrown in to fill the &s;entence, and to round it to the
<PB N="34" REF="45">
ear. We prefixed the &s;ame plau&s;ible conditions to any renewal of the negotiation, in our manife&s;to on the rejection of our propo&s;als at Ba&s;le. We did not con&s;ider tho&s;e conditions as binding. We opened a much more &s;erious negotiation without any &s;ort of regard to them; and there is no new negotiation, which we can po&s;&s;ibly open upon fewer indications of conciliation and equity, than were to be di&s;covered, when we entered into our la&s;t at Paris. Any of the &s;lighte&s;t pretences, any of the mo&s;t loo&s;e, formal, equivocating expre&s;&s;ions, would ju&s;tify us under the peroration of this piece, in again &s;ending the la&s;t, or &s;ome other Lord Malme&s;bury to Paris.</P>
<P>I hope I mi&s;under&s;tand this pledge; or, that we &s;hall &s;hew no more regard to it, than we have done to all the faith, that we have plighted to vigour and re&s;olution, in our former declaration. If I am to under&s;tand the conclu&s;ion of the declaration to be what unfortunately it &s;eems to me, we make an en|gagement with the enemy, without any corre&s;|pondent engagement on his &s;ide. We &s;eem to have cut our&s;elves off from any benefit which an intermediate &s;tate of things might furni&s;h to en|able us totally to overturn that power, &s;o little connected with moderation and ju&s;tice. By hold|ing out no hope, either to the ju&s;tly di&s;contented in France, or to any foreign power, and leaving the
<PB N="35" REF="46">
re-commencement of all treaty to this identical jun|to of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, we do in effect a&s;&s;ure and guarantee to them, the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the rich fruits of their confi&s;cations, of their murders of men, women, and children, and of all the multiplied, endle&s;s, namele&s;s iniquities by which they have obtained their power. We guarantee to them the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of a country, &s;uch and &s;o &s;ituated as France, round, entire, immen&s;ely perhaps augmented.</P>
<P>Well! &s;ome will &s;ay, in this ca&s;e we have only &s;ubmitted to the nature of things. The nature of things is, I admit, a &s;turdy adver&s;ary. This might be alledged as a plea for our attempt at a treaty. But what plea of that kind can be alledged, after the treaty was dead and gone, in favour of this po&s;thumous declaration? No nece&s;&s;ity has driven us to <HI>that</HI> pledge. It is without a counterpart even in expectation. And what can be &s;tated to obviate the evil which that &s;olitary engagement mu&s;t produce on the under&s;tandings or the fears of men? I a&s;k, what have the Regicides promi&s;ed you in return, in ca&s;e <HI>you</HI> &s;hould &s;hew what <HI>they</HI> would call di&s;po&s;itions to conciliation and equity, whil&s;t you are giving that pledge from the throne, and engaging Parliament to counter-&s;ecure it? It is an awful con&s;ideration. It was on the very day of the date of this wonderful pledge <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dec. 27, 1796.</NOTE>, in which
<PB N="36" REF="47">
we a&s;&s;umed the directorial Government as lawful, and in which we engaged our&s;elves to treat with them whenever they plea&s;ed; it was on that very day, the Regicide fleet was weighing anchor from one of your harbours, where it had remained four days in perfect quiet. The&s;e harbours of the Briti&s;h dominions are the ports of France. They are of no u&s;e, but to protect an enemy from your be&s;t Allies, the &s;torms of Heaven, and his own ra&s;h|ne&s;s. Had the <HI>We&s;t</HI> of Ireland been an unportu|ous coa&s;t, the French naval power would have been undone. The enemy u&s;es the moment for ho&s;tility, without the lea&s;t regard to your future di&s;po&s;itions of equity and conciliation. They go out of what were once your harbours, and they return to them at their plea&s;ure. Eleven days they had the full u&s;e of Bantry Bay, and at length their fleet returns from their harbour of Bantry to their harbour of Bre&s;t. Whil&s;t you are invoking the propitious &s;pirit of Regi|cide equity and conciliation, they an&s;wer you with an attack. They turn out the pacifick bearer of your "how do you does," Lord Malme&s;bury; and they return your vi&s;it, and their "thanks for your oblig|ing enquiries," by their old practi&s;ed a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in <HI>Hoche.</HI> They come to attack&mdash;What? A town, a &s;ort, a na|val &s;tation? They come to attack your King, your Con&s;titution, and the very being of that Parlia|ment, which was holding out to them the&s;e pledges, together with the entirene&s;s of the Empire, the
<PB N="37" REF="48">
Laws, Liberties, and Properties of all the people. We know that they meditated the very &s;ame in|va&s;ion, and for the very &s;ame purpo&s;es, upon this Kingdom; and had the coa&s;t been as opportune, would have effected it.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t <HI>you</HI> are in vain torturing your invention to a&s;&s;ure them of <HI>your</HI> &s;incerity and good faith, they have left no doubt concerning <HI>their</HI> good faith, and <HI>their</HI> &s;incerity towards tho&s;e to whom they have engaged their honour. To their power they have been true to the only pledge they have ever yet given to you, or to any of yours, I mean the &s;olemn engagement which they entered into with the deputation of traitors who appeared at their bar, from England and from Ireland, in 1792. They have been true and faithful to the engage|ment which they had made more largely; that is, their engagement to give effectual aid to in|&s;urrection and trea&s;on, wherever they might ap|pear in the world. We have &s;een the Briti&s;h De|claration. This is the counter-declaration of the Directory. This is the reciprocal pledge which Regicide amity gives to the conciliatory pledges of Kings! But, thank God, &s;uch pledges cannot exi&s;t &s;ingle. They have no counterpart; and if they had, the enemy's conduct cancels &s;uch de|clarations; and I tru&s;t, along with them, cancels
<PB N="38" REF="49">
every thing of mi&s;chief and di&s;honour that they contain.</P>
<P>There is one thing in this bu&s;ine&s;s which ap|pears to be wholly unaccountable, or accountable, on a &s;uppo&s;ition I dare not entertain for a moment. I cannot help a&s;king, Why all this pains, to clear the Briti&s;h Nation of ambition, perfidy, and the in&s;atiate thir&s;t of war? At what period of time was it that our country has de&s;erved that load of infamy, of which nothing but preternatural humi|liation in language and conduct can &s;erve to clear us? If we have de&s;erved this kind of evil fame from any thing we have done in a &s;tate of pro&s;|perity, I am &s;ure, that it is not an abject conduct in adver&s;ity that can clear our reputation. Well is it known that ambition can creep as well as &s;oar. The pride of no per&s;on in a flouri&s;hing condition is more ju&s;tly to be dreaded, than that of him who is mean and cringing under a doubtful and unpro&s;perous fortune. But it &s;eems it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome out-of-the-way proofs of our &s;incerity, as well as of our free|dom from ambition. Is then fraud and fal&s;e|hood become the di&s;tinctive character of Engli&s;h|men? Whenever your enemy choo&s;es to ac|cu&s;e you of perfidy and ill faith, will you put it into his power to throw you into the purgatory of
<PB N="39" REF="50">
&s;elf-humiliation? Is his charge equal to the find|ing of the grand jury of Europe, and &s;ufficient to put you upon your trial? But on that trial I will defend the Engli&s;h Mini&s;try. I am &s;orry that on &s;ome points I have, on the principles I have al|ways oppo&s;ed, &s;o good a defence to make. They were not the fir&s;t to begin the war. They did not excite the general confederacy in Europe, which was &s;o properly formed on the alarm given by the Jacobini&s;m of France. They did not be|gin with an ho&s;tile aggre&s;&s;ion on the Regicides or any of their allies. The&s;e parricides of their own country, di&s;ciplining them&s;elves for foreign by dome&s;tick violence, were the fir&s;t to attack a power that was our ally, by nature, by habit, and by the &s;anction of multiplied treaties. Is it not true, that they were the fir&s;t to declare war upon this kingdom? Is every word in the declaration from Downing-Street, concerning their conduct, and concerning ours and that of our allies, &s;o ob|viou&s;ly fal&s;e, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome new invented proofs of our good faith in order to ex|punge the memory of all this perfidy?</P>
<P>We know that over-labouring a point of this kind, has the direct contrary effect from what we wi&s;h. We know that there is a legal pre&s;umption again&s;t men <HI>quando &s;e nimis purgitant</HI>; and if a charge of ambition is not refuted by an affected hu|mility,
<PB N="40" REF="51">
certainly the character of fraud and perfidy is &s;till le&s;s to be wa&s;hed away by indications of meanne&s;s. Fraud and prevarication are &s;ervile vices. They &s;ometimes grow out of the nece&s;&s;ities, always out of the habits of &s;lavi&s;h and degenerate &s;pirits: and on the theatre of the world, it is not by a&s;|&s;uming the ma&s;k of a Davus or a Geta that an actor will obtain credit for manly &s;implicity and a liberal openne&s;s of proceeding. It is an erect countenance; it is a firm adherence to principle; it is a power of re&s;i&s;ting fal&s;e &s;hame and frivolous fear, that a&s;&s;ert our good faith and honour, and a&s;&s;ure to us the confidence of mankind. There|fore all the&s;e Negotiations, and all the Declara|tions with which they were preceded and fol|lowed, can only &s;erve to rai&s;e pre&s;umptions again&s;t that good faith and publick integrity, the fame of which to pre&s;erve inviolate is &s;o much the intere&s;t and duty of every nation.</P>
<P>The pledge is an engagement "to all Eu|rope." This is the more extraordinary, becau&s;e it is a pledge, which no power in Europe, whom I have yet heard of, has thought proper to require at our hands. I am not in the &s;ecrets of office; and therefore I may be excu&s;ed for proceeding upon probabilities and exteriour indications. I have &s;ur|veyed all Europe from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t, from the north to the &s;outh, in &s;earch of this call upon
<PB N="41" REF="52">
us to purge our&s;elves of "&s;ubtle <HI>duplicity</HI> and a <HI>punick</HI> &s;tyle" in our proceedings. I have not heard that his ExITEMency the Ottoman Amba&s;&s;a|dor has expre&s;&s;ed his doubts of the Briti&s;h &s;ince|rity in our Negotiation with the mo&s;t unchri&s;tian Republick lately &s;et up at our door. What &s;ympathy, in that quarter, may have introduced a remon&s;trance upon the want of faith in this na|tion, I cannot po&s;itively &s;ay. If it exi&s;ts, it is in Turki&s;h or Arabick, and po&s;&s;ibly is not yet tran&s;|lated. But none of the nations which compo&s;e the old Chri&s;tian world have I yet heard as calling upon us for tho&s;e judicial purgations and ordeals, by fire and water, which we have cho&s;en to go through;&mdash;for the other great proof, by battle, we &s;eem to decline.</P>
<P>For who&s;e u&s;e, entertainment, or in&s;truction, are all tho&s;e over-&s;trained and over-laboured pro|ceedings in Council, in Negotiation, and in Speeches in Parliament, intended? What Royal Cabinet is to be enriched with the&s;e high-fini&s;hed pictures of the arrogance of the &s;worn enemies of Kings, and the meek patience of a Briti&s;h Admini&s;tration? In what heart is it intended to kindle pity towards our multiplied mortifications and di&s;graces? At be&s;t it is &s;uper|fluous. What nation is unacquainted with the haughty di&s;po&s;ition of the common enemy of all
<PB N="42" REF="53">
nations? It has been more than &s;een, it has been felt; not only by tho&s;e who have been the victims of their imperious rapacity, but, in a degree, by tho&s;e very powers who have con&s;ented to e&s;tabli&s;h this robbery, that they might be able to copy it, and with impunity to make new u&s;urpations of their own. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia has hypothecated in tru&s;t to the Regicides his rich and fertile terri|tories on the Rhine, as a pledge of his zeal and af|fection to the cau&s;e of liberty and equality. He has &s;een them robbed with unbounded liberty, and with the mo&s;t levelling equality. The woods are wa&s;ted; the country is ravaged; property is con|fi&s;cated; and the people are put to bear a double yoke, in the exactions of a tyrannical Government and in the contributions of an ho&s;tile irruption. Is it to &s;atisfy the Court of Berlin, that the Court of London is to give the &s;ame &s;ort of pledge of it's &s;incerity and good faith to the French Directory? It is not that heart full of &s;en&s;ibility,&mdash;it is not Luche&s;ini, the Mini&s;ter of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, the late ally of England, and the pre&s;ent ally of it's enemy, who has demanded this pledge of our &s;incerity, as the price of the renewal of the long lea&s;e of his &s;incere friend&s;hip to this kingdom.</P>
<P>It is not to our enemy, the now faithful ally of Regicide, late the faithful ally of Great Britain, the Catholick King, that we addre&s;s our doleful
<PB N="43" REF="54">
lamentation: It is not to the <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> who&s;e declaration of war was one of the fir&s;t au&s;picious omens of general tranquillity, which our dove-like Amba&s;&s;ador, with the olive branch in his beak, was &s;aluted with at his entrance into the ark of clean birds at Paris.</P>
<P>Surely it is not to the Tetrarch of Sardinia, now the faithful ally of a power who has &s;eized upon all his fortre&s;&s;es, and confi&s;cated the olde&s;t dominions of his hou&s;e; it is not to this once powerful, once re&s;pected, and once cheri&s;hed ally of Great Britain, that we mean to prove the &s;incerity of the peace which we offered to make at his expence. Or is it to him we are to prove the arrogance of the power who, under the name of friend, oppre&s;&s;es him, and the poor remains of his &s;ubjects, with all the ferocity of the mo&s;t cruel enemy?</P>
<P>It is not to Holland, under the name of an ally, laid under a permanent military contribution, filled with their double garri&s;on of barbarous Ja|cobin troops, and ten times more barbarous Ja|cobin clubs and a&s;&s;emblies, that we find our&s;elves obliged to give this pledge.</P>
<P>Is it to Genoa, that we make this kind promi&s;e; a &s;tate which the Regicides were to defend in a favourable neutrality, but who&s;e neutrality has

<P>It is not the Grand Duke of Tu&s;cany who claims this Declaration; not the Grand Duke, who for his early &s;incerity, for his love of peace, and for his entire confidence in the amity of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of his Hou&s;e, has been complimented in the Bri|ti&s;h Parliament with the name of <HI>"the wi&s;e&s;t So|vereign in Europe:"</HI>&mdash;It is not this pacifick Solo|mon, or his philo&s;ophick cudgelled Mini&s;try, cudgelled by Engli&s;h and by French, who&s;e wi&s;|dom and philo&s;ophy between them, have placed Leghorn in the hands of the enemy of the Au&s;|trian family, and driven the only profitable commerce of Tu&s;cany from it's only port.

<P>It is not for his Holine&s;s we intend this con&s;o|latory declaration of our own weakne&s;s and of the tyrannous temper of his grand enemy.

Without ceremony, they tore from his cheri&s;hing arms, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which he held for five hun|dred years, undi&s;turbed by all the ambition of all the ambitious Monarchs who, during that period, have reigned in France. Is it to him, in who&s;e wrong we have in our late negotiation ceded his now unhappy countries near the Rhine, lately among&s;t the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing (perhaps the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing for their extent) of all the countries upon earth, that we are to prove the &s;incerity of our re&s;olu|tion to make peace with the Republick of bar|bari&s;m?

<P>Are we by this declaration to &s;atisfy the King of Naples whom we have left to &s;truggle as he can, after our abdication of Cor&s;ica, and the flight of the whole naval force of England out of the whole circuit of the Mediterranean, aban|doning our allies, our commerce, and the ho|nour of a nation, once the protectre&s;s of all other nations, becau&s;e &s;trengthened by the indepen|dence, and enriched by the commerce of them all? By the expre&s;s provi&s;ions of a recent treaty, we had engaged with the King of Naples to keep a naval force in the Mediterranean. But, good God! was a treaty at all nece&s;&s;ary for this? The uniform policy of this kingdom as a State, and eminently &s;o as a commercial State, has at all times led us to keep a powerful &s;quadron and a commodious naval &s;tation in that central &s;ea, which borders upon, and which connects, a far greater number and variety of States, European, A&s;iatick, and African, than any other. Without &s;uch a naval force, France mu&s;t become de&s;potick mi&s;tre&s;s of that &s;ea, and of all the countries who&s;e &s;hores it wa&s;hes. Our commerce mu&s;t become va&s;&s;al to her, and dependent on her will. Since

we are come no longer to tru&s;t to our force in arms, but to our dexterity in negotiation, and begin to pay a de&s;perate court to a proud and coy u&s;urpa|tion, and have finally &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;ador to the Bourbon Regicides at Paris; the King of Naples, who &s;aw, that no reliance was to be placed on our engagements, or on any pledge of our adhe|rence to our neare&s;t and deare&s;t intere&s;ts, has been obliged to &s;end his Amba&s;&s;ador al&s;o to join the re&s;t of the &s;qualid tribe of the repre&s;entatives of de|graded Kings. This Monarch, &s;urely, does not want any proof of the &s;incerity of our amicable di&s;po&s;itions to that amicable Republick, into who&s;e arms he has been given by our de&s;ertion of him.</P>
<P>To look to the powers of the North, it is not to the Dani&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador, in&s;olently treated, in his own character and in ours, that we are to give proofs of the Regicide arrogance, and of our di&s;|po&s;ition to &s;ubmit to it.</P>
<P>With regard to Sweden, I cannot &s;ay much. The French influence is &s;truggling with her inde|pendence; and they who con&s;ider the manner in which the Amba&s;&s;ador of that Power was treat|ed not long &s;ince at Paris, and the manner in which the father of the pre&s;ent King of Sweden (him&s;elf the victim of Regicide principles and

pa&s;&s;ions) would have looked on the pre&s;ent a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins of France, will not be very prompt to believe that the young King of Sweden has made this kind of requi&s;ition to the King of Great Britain, and has given this kind of au&s;pice of his new go|vernment.</P>
<P>I &s;peak la&s;t of the mo&s;t important of all. It certainly was not the late Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia at who&s;e in&s;tance we have given this pledge. It is not the new Emperour, the inheritour of &s;o much glory, and placed in a &s;ituation of &s;o much deli|cacy and difficulty for the pre&s;ervation of that in|heritance, who calls on England, the natural ally of his dominions, to deprive her&s;elf of her power of action, and to bind her&s;elf to France. France at no time, and in none of it's fa&s;hions, lea&s;t of all in it's la&s;t, has been ever looked upon as the friend either of Ru&s;&s;ia or of Great Britain. Every thing good, I tru&s;t, is to be expected from this Prince, whatever may be, without authority, given out of an influence over his mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that only Potentate, from whom he has any thing to ap|prehend, or with whom he has much even to di&s;cu&s;s.</P>
<P>This Sovereign knows, I have no doubt, and feels, on what &s;ort of bottom is to be laid the foundation of a Ru&s;&s;ian Throne. He knows what a rock of
<PB N="51" REF="62">
native granite is to form the pede&s;tal of his &s;ta|tue, who is to emulate Peter the Great. His re|nown will be in continuing with ea&s;e and &s;afety, what his predece&s;&s;or was obliged to atchieve through mighty &s;truggles. He is &s;en&s;ible, that his bu&s;ine&s;s is not to innovate, but to &s;ecure and to e&s;tabli&s;h; that reformations at this day are attempts at be&s;t of ambiguous utility. He will revere his father with the piety of a &s;on; but in his government he will imitate the policy of his mother. His father, with many exITEMent qualities, had a &s;hort reign; be|cau&s;e, being a native Ru&s;&s;ian, he was unfortu|nately advi&s;ed to act in the &s;pirit of a foreigner. His mother reigned over Ru&s;&s;ia three and thirty years with the greate&s;t glory; becau&s;e, with the di&s;advantage of being a foreigner born, &s;he made her&s;elf a Ru&s;&s;ian. A wi&s;e Prince like the pre&s;ent will improve his country; but it will be cautiou&s;ly and progre&s;&s;ively, upon it's own native ground-work of religion, manners, habitudes, and alliances. If I progno&s;ticate right, it is not the Emperour of Ru&s;&s;ia that ever will call for extravagant proofs of our de&s;ire to reconcile our&s;elves to the irrecon|cileable enemy of all Thrones.</P>
<P>I do not know why I &s;hould not include Ame|rica among the European Powers, becau&s;e &s;he is of European origin; and has not yet, like France,
<PB N="52" REF="63">
destroyed all traces of manners, laws, opinions, and u&s;ages which &s;he drew from Europe. As long as that Europe &s;hall have any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions either in the &s;outhern or the northern parts of that Ame|rica, even &s;eparated as it is by the ocean, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a part of the European &s;y&s;tem. It is not America, menaced with internal ruin from the attempts to plant Jacobini&s;m in&s;tead of Liberty in that country; it is not America, who&s;e independence is directly attacked by the French, the enemies of the independence of all nations, that calls upon us to give &s;ecurity by di&s;arming our&s;elves in a treacherous peace. By &s;uch a peace, we &s;hall deliver the Americans, their liberty, and their order, without re&s;ource, to the mercy of their imperious allies, who will have peace or neutrality with no &s;tate, which is not ready to join her in war again&s;t England.</P>
<P>Having run round the whole circle of the Euro|pean &s;y&s;tem wherever it acts, I mu&s;t affirm, that all the foreign Powers who are not leagued with France for the utter de&s;truction of all balance through Europe and throughout the world, de|mand other a&s;&s;urances from this kingdom than are given in that Declaration. They require a&s;&s;urances, not of the &s;incerity of our good di&s;po&s;itions towards the u&s;urpation in France, but of our affection to|wards
<PB N="53" REF="64">
the College of the antient States of Europe, and pledges of our con&s;tancy, our fidelity, and of our fortitude in re&s;i&s;ting to the la&s;t the power that menaces them all. The apprehen&s;ion from which they wi&s;h to be delivered cannot be from any thing they dread in the ambition of England. Our power mu&s;t be their &s;trength. They hope more from us than they fear. I am &s;ure the only ground of their hope, and of our hope, is in the greatne&s;s of mind hitherto &s;hewn by the people of this nation, and it's adherence to the unalterable principles of it's antient policy, whatever Government may finally prevail in France. I have entered into this detail of the wi&s;hes and expectations of the European Powers, in order to point out more clearly, not &s;o much what their di&s;po&s;ition, as (a con&s;ideration of far greater importance) what their &s;ituation de|mands, according as that &s;ituation is related to the Regicide Republick and to this Kingdom.</P>
<P>Then if it is not to &s;atisfy the foreign Powers we make this a&s;&s;urance, to what Power at home is it that we pay all this humiliating court? Not to the old Whigs or to the antient Tories of this Kingdom; if any memory of &s;uch antient divi&s;ions &s;till exi&s;ts among&s;t us. To which of the princi|ples of the&s;e parties is this a&s;&s;urance agreeable? Is it to the Whigs we are to recommend the aggran|di&s;ement
<PB N="54" REF="65">
of France, and the &s;ubver&s;ion of the balance of power? Is it to the Tories we are to re|commend our eagerne&s;s to cement our&s;elves with the enemies of Royalty and Religion? But if the&s;e parties, which by their di&s;&s;entions have &s;o often di&s;tracted the Kingdom, which by their union have once &s;aved it, and which by their colli&s;ion and mutual re&s;i&s;tance, have pre&s;erved the variety of this Con&s;titution in it's unity, be (as I believe they are) nearly extinct by the growth of new ones, which have their roots in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the times&mdash;I wi&s;h to know, to which of the&s;e new de&s;criptions this Declaration is addre&s;&s;ed? It can hardly be to tho&s;e per&s;ons, who, in the new di&s;tribution of parties, con&s;ider the con&s;ervation in England of the antient order of things, as nece&s;|&s;ary to pre&s;erve order every where el&s;e, and who regard the general con&s;ervation of order in other countries, as reciprocally nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the &s;ame &s;tate of things in tho&s;e I&s;lands. That party never can wi&s;h to &s;ee Great Britain pledge her&s;elf to give the lead and the ground of advantage and &s;uperiority to the France of to-day, in any treaty which is to &s;ettle Europe. I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that &s;o far from expecting &s;uch an engagement, they are generally &s;tupefied and confounded with it. That the other party which demands great changes here, and is &s;o plea&s;ed to &s;ee them every where el&s;e,
<PB N="55" REF="66">
which party I call Jacobin, that this faction does from the bottom of it's heart, approve the declara|tion, and does erect it's cre&s;t upon the engagement, there can be little doubt. To them it may be ad|dre&s;&s;ed with propriety, for it an&s;wers their purpo&s;es in every point.</P>
<P>The party in Oppo&s;ition within the Hou&s;e of Lords and Commons, it is irreverent, and half a breach of privilege (far from my thoughts) to con&s;i|der as Jacobin. This party has always denied the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a faction; and has treated the machinations of tho&s;e, whom you and I call Jaco|bins, as &s;o many forgeries and fictions of the Mini|&s;ter and his adherents, to find a pretext for de&s;troy|ing freedom, and &s;etting up an arbitrary power in this Kingdom. However, whether this Minority has a leaning towards the French &s;y&s;tem, or only a charitable toleration of tho&s;e who lean that way, it is certain, that they have always attacked the &s;ince|rity of the Mini&s;ter in the &s;ame modes, and on the very &s;ame grounds, and nearly in the &s;ame terms, with the Directory. It mu&s;t, therefore, be at the tri|bunal of the Minority, (from the whole tenour of the &s;peech) that the Mini&s;ter appeared to con&s;ider him&s;elf obliged to purge him&s;elf of duplicity. It was at their bar that he held up his hand. It was on their <HI>&s;ellette</HI> that he &s;eemed to an&s;wer
<PB N="56" REF="67">
interrogatories; it was on their principles that he defended his whole conduct. They certainly take what the French call the <HI>haute du pav&eacute;.</HI> They have loudly called for the negotiation. It was accorded to them. They engaged their &s;upport of the war with vigour, in ca&s;e Peace was not granted on honourable terms. Peace was not granted on any terms, honourable or &s;hameful. Whether the&s;e judges, few in number but powerful in juri&s;diction, are &s;atisfied; whether they to whom this new pledge is hypothecated, have redeemed their own; whether they have given one particle more of their &s;upport to Mini&s;try, or even favour|ed them with their good opinion, or their candid con&s;truction, I leave it to tho&s;e, who recollect that memorable debate, to determine.</P>
<P>The fact is, that neither this Declaration, nor the negotiation which is it's &s;ubject, could &s;erve any one good purpo&s;e, foreign or dome&s;tick; it could conduce to no end either with regard to allies or neutrals. It tends neither to bring back the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">led; nor to give courage to the fearful; nor to animate and confirm tho&s;e, who are hearty and zealous in the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I hear it has been &s;aid (though I can &s;carcely believe it) that a di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;on in an A&s;|&s;embly,
<PB N="57" REF="68">
where if there be le&s;s of the torrent and tempe&s;t of eloquence, more guarded expre&s;&s;ion is to be expected, that, indeed, there was no ju&s;t ground of hope in this bu&s;ine&s;s from the begin|ning.</P>
<P>It is plain, that this noble per&s;on, however conver&s;ant in negotiation, having been employ|ed in no le&s;s than four emba&s;&s;ies, and in two hemi&s;pheres, and in one of tho&s;e negotiations having fully experienced what it was to proceed to treaty without previous encouragement, was not at all con&s;ulted in this experiment. For his Maje&s;ty's principal Mini&s;ter declared, on the very &s;ame day, in another Hou&s;e, <Q>his Ma|je&s;ty's deep and &s;incere regret at it's unfortu|nate and abrupt termination, &s;o different from the wi&s;hes and <HI>hopes</HI> that were entertained;</Q> &mdash;and in other parts of the &s;peech &s;peaks of this abrupt termination as a great di&s;appointment, and as a fall from &s;incere endeavours and &s;anguine expectation. Here are, indeed, &s;enti|ments diametrically oppo&s;ite, as to the hopes with which the negotiation was commenced and carried on, and what is curious is, the grounds of the hopes on the one &s;ide, and the de&s;pair on the other, are exactly the &s;ame. The logical conclusion from the common premi&s;es, is indeed in favour of the noble Lord, for they are agreed that the enemy was far from giving the lea&s;t de|gree
<PB N="58" REF="69">
of countenance to any &s;uch hopes; and that they proceeded, in &s;pite of every di&s;courage|ment which the enemy had thrown in their way. But there is another material point in which they do not &s;eem to differ; that is to &s;ay, the re&s;ult of the de&s;perate experiment of the noble Lord, and of the promi&s;ing attempt of the Great Mini&s;ter, in &s;atisfying the people of England, and in cau&s;ing di&s;content to the people of France; or, as the Mini&s;ter expre&s;&s;es it, "in uniting England and in dividing France."</P>
<P>For my own part, though I perfectly agreed with the noble Lord, that the attempt was de&s;|perate, &s;o de&s;perate indeed, as to de&s;erve <HI>his</HI> name of an experiment, yet no fair man can po&s;|&s;ibly doubt, that the Mini&s;ter was perfectly &s;in|cere in his proceeding, and that, from his ar|dent wi&s;hes for peace with the Regicides, he was led to conceive hopes which were founded rather in his vehement de&s;ires than in any ra|tional ground of political &s;peculation. Con|vinced as I am of this, it had been better, in my humble opinion, that per&s;ons of great name and authority had ab&s;tained from tho&s;e topics which had been u&s;ed to call the Mini&s;ter's &s;in|cerity into doubt, and had not adopted the &s;en|timents of the Directory upon the &s;ubject of all our negotiations; for the noble Lord expre&s;sly
<PB N="59" REF="70">
&s;ays, that the experiment was made for the &s;a|tisfaction of the country. The Directory &s;ays exactly the &s;ame thing. Upon granting, in con&s;equence of our &s;upplications, the pa&s;&s;port to Lord Malme&s;bury, in order to remove all &s;ort of hope from it's &s;ucce&s;s, they charged all our previous &s;teps, even to that moment of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive demand to be admitted to their pre&s;ence, on duplicity and perfidy; and a&s;&s;umed, that the object of all the &s;teps, we had taken was <Q>that of ju&s;tifying the continuance of the war in the eyes of the Engli&s;h nation, and of throw|ing all the odium of it upon the French: The Engli&s;h nation (&s;aid they) &s;upports impa|tiently the continuance of the war, and a <HI>reply mu&s;t be made to it's complaints and it's re|proaches</HI>; the Parliament is about to be open|ed, <HI>and the mouths of the orators who will de|claim again&s;t the war mu&s;t be &s;hut; the demands for new taxes mu&s;t be ju&s;tified; and to obtain the&s;e re&s;ults, it is nece&s;&s;ary to be able to advance, that the French Government refu&s;es every rea&s;onable propo&s;ition for peace.</HI></Q> I am &s;orry that the lan+guage of the friends to Mini&s;try and the enemies to mankind &s;hould be &s;o much in uni&s;on.</P>
<P>As to the fact in which the&s;e parties are &s;o well agreed, that the experiment ought to have been made for the &s;atisfaction of this country,
<PB N="60" REF="71">
(meaning the country of England) it were well to be wi&s;hed, that per&s;ons of eminence would cea&s;e to make them&s;elves repre&s;entatives of the people of England without a letter of attorney, or any other act of procuration. In legal con|&s;truction, the &s;en&s;e of the people of England is to be collected from the Hou&s;e of Commons; and, though I do not deny the po&s;&s;ibility of an abu&s;e of this tru&s;t as well as any other, yet I think, without the mo&s;t weighty rea&s;ons, and in the mo&s;t urgent exigencies, it is highly dange|rous to &s;uppo&s;e that the Hou&s;e &s;peaks any thing contrary to the &s;en&s;e of the people, or that the repre&s;entative is &s;ilent when the &s;en&s;e of the con|&s;tituent &s;trongly, decidedly, and upon long de|liberation, &s;peaks audibly upon any topic of moment. If there is a doubt, whether the Hou&s;e of Commons repre&s;ents perfectly the whole Com|mons of Great Britain, (I think there is none) there can be no que&s;tion but that the Lords and the Commons together repre&s;ent the &s;en&s;e of the whole people to the Crown, and to the world. Thus it is, when we &s;peak legally and con&s;titu|tionally. In a great mea&s;ure, it is equally true, when we &s;peak prudentially; but I do not pre|tend to a&s;&s;ert, that there are no other principles to guide di&s;cretion than tho&s;e which are or can be fixed by &s;ome law, or &s;ome con&s;titution; yet before the legally pre&s;umed &s;en&s;e of the people &s;hould
<PB N="61" REF="72">
be &s;uper&s;eded by a &s;uppo&s;ition of one more real (as in all ca&s;es, where a legal pre&s;umption is to be a&s;certained) &s;ome &s;trong proofs ought to exi&s;t of a contrary di&s;po&s;ition in the people at large, and &s;ome deci&s;ive indications of their de|&s;ire upon this &s;ubject. There can be no que&s;|tion, that previou&s;ly to a direct me&s;&s;age from the Crown, neither Hou&s;e of Parliament did in|dicate any thing like a wi&s;h for &s;uch advances as we have made, or &s;uch negotiations as we have carried on. The Parliament has a&s;&s;ented to Mini&s;try; it is not Mini&s;try that has obeyed the impul&s;e of Parliament. The people at large have their organs through which they can &s;peak to Parliament and to the Crown by a re&s;pectful petition, and, though not with ab&s;olute autho|rity, yet with weight, they can in&s;truct their Re|pre&s;entatives. The freeholders and other elec|tors in this kingdom have another, and a &s;urer mode of expre&s;&s;ing their &s;entiments concerning the conduct which is held by Members of Par|liament. In the middle of the&s;e tran&s;actions, this la&s;t opportunity has been held out to them. In all the&s;e points of view, I po&s;itively a&s;&s;ert, that the people have no where, and in no way, expre&s;&s;ed their wi&s;h of throwing them&s;elves and their Sovereign at the feet of a wicked and ran|corous foe, to &s;upplicate mercy, which, from the nature of that foe, and from the circum|&s;tances
<PB N="62" REF="73">
of affairs, we had no &s;ort of ground to expect. It is undoubtedly the bu&s;ine&s;s of Mi|ni&s;ters very much to con&s;ult the inclinations of the people, but they ought to take great care that they do not receive that inclination from the few per&s;ons who may happen to approach them. The petty intere&s;ts of &s;uch gentlemen, their low conceptions of things, their fears ari&s;|ing from the danger to which the very arduous and critical &s;ituation of publick affairs may ex|po&s;e their places; their apprehen&s;ions from the hazards to which the di&s;contents of a few po|pular men at elections may expo&s;e their &s;eats in Parliament; all the&s;e cau&s;es trouble and confu&s;e the repre&s;entations which they make to Mini|&s;ters of the real temper of the nation. If Mi|ni&s;ters, in&s;tead of following the great indica|tions of the Con&s;titution, proceed on &s;uch re|ports, they will take the whi&s;pers of a cabal for the voice of the people, and the coun&s;els of imprudent timidity for the wi&s;dom of a nation.</P>
<P>I well remember, that when the fortune of the war began, and it began pretty early, to turn, as it is common and natural, we were de|jected by the lo&s;&s;es that had been &s;u&s;tained, and with the doubtful i&s;&s;ue of the conte&s;ts that were fore&s;een. But not a word was uttered that &s;up|po&s;ed peace upon any proper terms, was in our
<PB N="63" REF="74">
power, or therefore that it &s;hould be in our de|&s;ire. As u&s;ual, with or without rea&s;on, we cri|tici&s;ed the conduct of the war, and compared our fortunes with our mea&s;ures. The ma&s;s of the nation went no further. For I &s;uppo&s;e that you always under&s;tood me as &s;peaking of that very preponderating part of the nation, which had always been equally adver&s;e to the French principles, and to the general progre&s;s of their Revolution throughout Europe; con&s;idering the final &s;ucce&s;s of their arms and the triumph of their principles as one and the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t means that were u&s;ed, by any one profe&s;&s;ing our principles, to change the minds of this party upon that &s;ubject, appeared in a &s;mall pamphlet circulated with con&s;iderable indu&s;try. It was commonly given to the noble per&s;on him|&s;elf, who has pa&s;&s;ed judgment upon all hopes from negotiation, and ju&s;tified our late abortive at|tempt only as an experiment made to &s;atisfy the country; and yet that pamphlet led the way in endeavouring to di&s;&s;atisfy that very country with the continuance of the war, and to rai&s;e in the people the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations from &s;ome &s;uch cour&s;e of negotiation as has been fa|tally pur&s;ued.

in que&s;tion to that authour; but without mention|ing his name in the title-page, it pa&s;&s;ed for his, and does &s;till pa&s;s uncontradicted. It was entitled "Remarks on the apparent Circum&s;tances of the War in the fourth Week of October, 1795."</P>
<P>This &s;anguine little king's-fi&s;her (not pre&s;cient of the &s;torm, as by his in&s;tinct he ought to be) appearing at that uncertain &s;ea&s;on, before the riggs of Old Michaelmas were yet well compo&s;|ed, and when the inclement &s;torms of winter were approaching, began to flicker over the &s;eas and was bu&s;y in building it's halcyon ne&s;t as if the an|gry ocean had been &s;oothed by the genial breath of May. Very unfortunately this au&s;pice was in&s;tant|ly followed by a &s;peech from the Throne, in the very &s;pirit and principles of that pamphlet.</P>
<P>I &s;ay nothing of the new&s;papers, which are undoubtedly in the intere&s;t, and which are &s;up|po&s;ed by &s;ome to be directly or indirectly under the influence of Mini&s;ters, and which, with le&s;s au|thority than the pamphlet I &s;peak of, had indeed for &s;ome time before held a &s;imilar language, in direct contradiction to their more early tone: in &s;o much, that I can &s;peak it with a certain a&s;|&s;urance, that very many who wi&s;hed to Admi|ni&s;tration as well as you and I do, thought that in giving their opinion in favour of this peace,
<PB N="65" REF="76">
they followed the opinion of Mini&s;try&mdash;they were con&s;cious that they did not lead it. My inference therefore is this, that the negotiation, whatever it's merits may be, in the general prin|ciple and policy of undertaking it, is, what every political mea&s;ure in general ought to be, the &s;ole work of Admini&s;tration; and that if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t was an experiment to &s;atisfy any body, it was to &s;atisfy tho&s;e, whom the Mini&s;ters were in the daily habit of condemning, and by whom they were daily condemned; I mean, the <HI>Leaders</HI> of the <HI>Oppo&s;ition</HI> in <HI>Parliament.</HI> I am certain that the Mini&s;ters were then, and are now, inve&s;ted with the fulle&s;t confidence of the major part of the nation, to pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures of peace or war as the nature of things &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t as mo&s;t adapted to the publick &s;afety. It is in this light therefore as a mea&s;ure which ought to have been avoided, and ought not to be repeated, that I take the liberty of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the merits of this &s;y&s;tem of Regicide Negotiations. It is not a matter of light experiment that leaves us where it found us. Peace or war are the great hinges upon which the very being of nations turns. Negotiations are the means of making peace or preventing war, and are therefore of more &s;eri|ous importance than almo&s;t any &s;ingle event of war can po&s;&s;ibly be.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="77">At the very out&s;et I do not he&s;itate to affirm, that this country in particular, and the publick law in general, have &s;uffered more by this nego|tiation of experiment, than by all the battles together that we have lo&s;t from the commence|ment of this century to this time, when it touches &s;o nearly to it's clo&s;e. I therefore have the mi&s;fortune not to coincide in opinion with the great State&s;man who &s;et on foot a negotia|tion, as he &s;aid, <Q>in &s;pite of the con&s;tant oppo|&s;ition he had met with from France.</Q>
He admits, <Q>that the difficulty in this negotiation became mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly increa&s;ed indeed, by the &s;ituation in which we were placed, and the manner in which alone the enemy would <HI>admit</HI> of a negotiation.</Q> This &s;ituation &s;o de&s;cribed, and &s;o truly de&s;cribed, rendered our &s;olicitation not only degrading, but from the very out&s;et evidently hopele&s;s.</P>
<P>I find it a&s;&s;erted, and even a merit taken for it, <Q>that this country &s;urmounted every diffi|culty of form and etiquette which the enemy had thrown in our way.</Q> An odd way of &s;urmounting a difficulty by cowering under it! I find it a&s;&s;erted that an heroick re&s;olution had been taken, and avowed in Parliament, previous to this negotiation, <Q>that no con&s;ideration of etiquette &s;hould &s;tand in the way of it.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="78">Etiquette, if I under&s;tand rightly the term, which in any extent is of modern u&s;age, had it's original application to tho&s;e ceremonial and formal ob&s;ervances practi&s;ed at Courts, which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by long u&s;age, in order to pre&s;erve the &s;overeign power from the rude in|tru&s;ion of licentious familiarity, as well as to pre&s;erve Maje&s;ty it&s;elf from a di&s;po&s;ition to con|&s;ult it's ea&s;e at the expence of it's dignity. The term came afterwards to have a greater la|titude, and to be employed to &s;ignify certain formal methods u&s;ed in the tran&s;actions between &s;overeign States.</P>
<P>In the more limited as well as in the larger &s;en&s;e of the term, without knowing what the etiquette is, it is impo&s;&s;ible to determine whe|ther it is a vain and captious punctilio, or a form nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve decorum in character and order in bu&s;ine&s;s. I readily admit, that nothing tends to facilitate the i&s;&s;ue of all pub|lic tran&s;actions more than a mutual di&s;po&s;ition in the parties treating, to wave all ceremony. But the u&s;e of this temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the recogni&s;ed modes of re&s;pect con&s;i&s;ts in it's being mutual, and in the &s;pirit of conciliation in which all ceremony is laid a&s;ide. On the contrary, when one of the parties to a treaty intrenches him&s;elf up to the chin in the&s;e ceremonies, and
<PB N="68" REF="79">
will not, on his &s;ide, abate a &s;ingle punctilio, and that all the conce&s;&s;ions are upon one &s;ide only, the party &s;o conceding does by this act place him|&s;elf in a relation of inferiority, and thereby fun|damentally &s;ubverts that equality which is of the very e&s;&s;ence of all treaty.</P>
<P>After this formal act of degradation, it was but a matter of cour&s;e, that gross in&s;ult &s;hould be offered to our Amba&s;&s;ador, and that he &s;hould tamely &s;ubmit to it. He found him&s;elf provoked to complain of the atrocious libels again&s;t his publick character and his per&s;on, which appeared in a paper under the avowed patronage of that Government. The Regicide Directory, on this complaint, did not recog|ni&s;e the paper; and that was all. They did not puni&s;h, they did not di&s;mi&s;s, they did not even reprimand the writer. As to our Amba&s;|&s;ador, this total want of reparation for the in|jury was pa&s;&s;ed by under the pretence of de&s;|pi&s;ing it.</P>
<P>In this, but too &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s, it is not po&s;|&s;ible here to avoid a &s;mile. Contempt is not a thing to be de&s;pi&s;ed. It may be borne with a calm and equal mind, but no man by lifting his head high can pretend that he does not per|ceive the &s;corns that are poured down upon
<PB N="69" REF="80">
him from above. All the&s;e &s;udden complaints of injury, and all the&s;e deliberate &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to it, are the inevitable con&s;equences of the &s;itua|tion in which we had placed our&s;elves; a &s;ituation wherein the in&s;ults were &s;uch as nature would not enable us to bear, and circum&s;tances would not permit us to re&s;ent.</P>
<P>It was not long, however, after this contempt of contempt upon the part of our Amba&s;&s;ador (who by the way repre&s;ented his Sovereign) that a new object was furni&s;hed for di&s;playing &s;enti|ments of the &s;ame kind, though the ca&s;e was infinitely aggravated. Not the Amba&s;&s;ador, but the King him&s;elf was libelled and in&s;ulted; libelled, not by a creature of the Directory, but by the Directory it&s;elf. At lea&s;t &s;o Lord Malme&s;|bury under&s;tood it, and &s;o he an&s;wered it in his note of the 12th December, 1796, in which he &s;ays, <Q>With regard to the <HI>offen&s;ive and inju|rious</HI> in&s;inuations which are contained in that paper, and which are only calculated to throw new ob&s;tacles in the way of that accommo|dation, which the French Government pro|fe&s;s to de&s;ire, THE KING HAS DEEMED IT FAR BENEATH HIS DIGNITY to permit an an&s;wer to be made to them on his part, in any manner what&s;oever.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="81">I am of opinion, that if his Maje&s;ty had kept aloof from that wa&s;h and off-&s;couring of every thing that is low and barbarous in the world, it might be well thought unworthy of his dignity to take notice of &s;uch &s;currilities. They mu&s;t be con&s;idered as much the natural expre&s;&s;ion of that kind of animal, as it is the expre&s;&s;ion of the feelings of a dog to bark; but when the King had been advi&s;ed to recogni&s;e not only the mon&s;trous compo&s;ition as a Sovereign Power, but, in conduct, to admit &s;omething in it like a &s;uperiority, when the Bench of Regicide was made, at lea&s;t, co-ordinate with his Throne, and rai&s;ed upon a platform full as elevated, this treatment could not be pa&s;&s;ed by under the ap|pearance of de&s;pi&s;ing it. It would not, indeed, have been proper to keep up a war of the &s;ame kind, but an immediate, manly, and decided re&s;entment ought to have been the con&s;equence. We ought not to have waited for the di&s;grace|ful di&s;mi&s;&s;al of our Amba&s;&s;ador. There are ca&s;es in which we may pretend to &s;leep: but the wittol rule has &s;ome &s;en&s;e in it, <HI>Non omnibus dormio.</HI> We might, however, have &s;eemed ig|norant of the affront; but what was the fact? Did we di&s;&s;emble or pa&s;s it by in &s;ilence? When dignity is talked of, a language which I did not expect to hear in &s;uch a tran&s;action, I mu&s;t &s;ay what all the world mu&s;t feel, that it
<PB N="71" REF="82">
was not for the King's dignity to notice this in&s;ult, and not to re&s;ent it. This mode of pro|ceeding is formed on new ideas of the corre|&s;pondence between Sovereign Powers.</P>
<P>This was far from the only ill effect of the policy of degradation. The &s;tate of inferiority in which we were placed in this vain attempt at treaty, drove us headlong from errour into errour, and led us to wander far away, not only from all the paths which have been beaten in the old cour&s;e of political communication between man|kind, but out of the ways even of the mo&s;t common prudence. Again&s;t all rules, after we had met nothing but rebuffs in return to all our propo&s;als, we made <HI>two confidential communica|tions</HI> to tho&s;e in whom we had no confidence, and who repo&s;ed no confidence in us. What was wor&s;e, we were fully aware of the madne&s;s of the &s;tep we were taking. Amba&s;&s;adors are not &s;ent to a ho&s;tile power, per&s;evering in &s;entiments of ho&s;tility, to make candid, confidential, and amicable communications. Hitherto the world has con&s;idered it as the duty of an Amba&s;&s;ador in &s;uch a &s;ituation to be cautious, guarded, dex|terous, and circum&s;pect. It is true that mutual confidence and common intere&s;t, di&s;pen&s;e with all rules, &s;mooth the rugged way, remove every ob&s;tacle, and make all things plain and level. When, in the la&s;t century, <HI>Temple</HI> and
<PB N="72" REF="83">
<HI>De Witt</HI> negotiated the famous Triple Alliance, their candour, their freedom, and the mo&s;t <HI>con|fidential</HI> di&s;clo&s;ures, were the re&s;ult of true po|licy. Accordingly, in &s;pite of all the dilatory forms of the complex Government of the United Provinces, the treaty was concluded in three days. It did not take a much longer time to bring the &s;ame State (that of Holland) through a &s;till more complicated tran&s;action, that of the <HI>Grand Alliance.</HI> But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, this un|paralleled candour, this unpardonable want of re&s;erve, produced what might have been expect|ed from it, the mo&s;t &s;erious evils. It in&s;tructed the enemy in the whole plan of our demands and conce&s;&s;ions. It made the mo&s;t fatal di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, it induced us to lay down the ba&s;is of a treaty which it&s;elf had nothing to re&s;t upon; it &s;eems, we thought we had gained a great point in getting this ba&s;is admitted&mdash;that is, a ba&s;is of mutual compen&s;ation and exchange of conque&s;ts. If a di&s;po&s;ition to peace, and with any rea&s;onable a&s;&s;urance, had been previ|ou&s;ly indicated, &s;uch a plan of arrangement might with propriety and &s;afety be propo&s;ed, becau&s;e the&s;e arrangements were not, in effect, to make the ba&s;is, but a part of the &s;uper&s;truc|ture of the fabrick of pacification. The order of things would thus be rever&s;ed. The mutual di&s;po&s;ition to peace, would form the rea&s;onable
<PB N="73" REF="84">
ba&s;e upon which the &s;cheme of compen&s;ation, upon one &s;ide or the other, might be con&s;truct|ed. This truly fundamental ba&s;e being once laid, all differences ari&s;ing from the &s;pirit of huck&s;tering and barter might be ea&s;ily adju&s;ted. If the re&s;toration of peace, with a view to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a fair balance of power in Eu|rope, had been made the real ba&s;is of the treaty, the reciprocal value of the compen&s;ations could not be e&s;timated according to their proportion to each other, but according to their propor|tionate relation to that end: to that great end the whole would be &s;ub&s;ervient. The effect of the treaty would be in a manner &s;ecured before the detail of particulars was begun, and for a plain rea&s;on, becau&s;e the ho&s;tile &s;pirit on both &s;ides had been conjured down; but if in the full fury, and unappea&s;ed rancour of war, a little traffick is attempted, it is ea&s;y to divine what mu&s;t be the con&s;equence to tho&s;e who endea|vour to open that kind of petty commerce.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate what I have &s;aid, I go back no further than to the two la&s;t Treaties of Paris, and to the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which preceded the fir&s;t of the&s;e two Treaties of Paris by about fourteen or fifteen years. I do not mean here to critici&s;e any of them. My opi|nions upon &s;ome particulars of the Treaty of
<PB N="74" REF="85">
Paris in 1763, are publi&s;hed in a pamphlet,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations on a late State of the Nation.</NOTE> which your recollection will readily bring into your view. I recur to them only to &s;hew that their ba&s;is had not been, and never could have been a mere dealing of truck and barter, but that the parties being willing, from common fatigue or common &s;uffering, to put an end to a war, the fir&s;t object of which had either been obtained or de&s;paired of, the le&s;&s;er objects were not thought worth the price of further conte&s;t. The parties under&s;tanding one ano|ther, &s;o much was given away without con&s;i|dering from who&s;e budget it came, not as the value of the objects, but as the value of peace to the parties might require. At the la&s;t treaty of Paris the &s;ubjugation of America being de|&s;paired of on the part of Great Britain, and the independence of America being looked upon as &s;ecure upon the part of France, the main cau&s;e of the war was removed; and then the conque&s;ts which France had made upon us (for we had made none of importance upon her) were &s;ur|rendered with &s;ufficient facility. Peace was re|&s;tored as peace. In America the parties &s;tood as they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. A limit was to be &s;et|tled, but &s;ettled as a limit to &s;ecure that peace, and not at all on a &s;y&s;tem of equivalents, for which, as we then &s;tood with the United States, there were little or no materials.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="86">At the preceding treaty of Paris, I mean that of 1763, there was nothing at all on which to fix a ba&s;is of compen&s;ation from reciprocal ce&s;&s;ion of conque&s;ts. They were all on one &s;ide. The que&s;tion with us was not what we were to receive, and on what con&s;ideration, but what we were to keep for indemnity, or to cede for peace. Accordingly no place being left for barter, &s;a|crifices were made on our &s;ide to peace; and we &s;urrendered to the French their mo&s;t valua|ble po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the We&s;t Indies without any equivalent. The re&s;t of Europe fell &s;oon after into it's antient order; and the German war ended exactly where it had begun.</P>
<P>The treaty of Aix la Chapelle was built upon a &s;imilar ba&s;is. All the conque&s;ts in Europe had been made by France. She had &s;ubdued the Au&s;trian Netherlands, and broken open the gates of Holland. We had taken nothing in the We&s;t Indies, and Cape Breton was a trifling bu&s;ine&s;s indeed. France gave up all for peace. The allies had given up all that was ceded at Utrecht. Louis the Fourteenth made all, or nearly all, the ce&s;&s;ions at Ry&s;wick, and at Ni|meguen. In all tho&s;e treaties, and in all the preceding, as well as in the others which inter|vened, the que&s;tion never had been that of bar|ter. The balance of power had been ever a&s;|&s;umed as the known common law of Europe at
<PB N="76" REF="87">
all times, and by all powers: the que&s;tion had only been (as it mu&s;t happen) on the more or le&s;s inclination of that balance.</P>
<P>This general balance was regarded in four principal points of view:&mdash;the GREAT MIDDLE BALANCE, which comprehended Great Britain, France, and Spain; the BALANCE OF THE NORTH; the BALANCE, external and internal, of GERMANY; and the BALANCE OF ITALY. In all tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems of balance, England was the power to who&s;e cu&s;tody it was thought it might be mo&s;t &s;afely committed.</P>
<P>France, as &s;he happened to &s;tand, &s;ecured the balance, or endangered it. Without que&s;tion &s;he had been long the &s;ecurity for the balance of Germany, and under her au&s;pices the &s;y&s;tem, if not formed, had been at lea&s;t perfected. She was &s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure with regard to Italy, more than occa&s;ionally. She had a clear intere&s;t in the balance of the North, and had endea|voured to pre&s;erve it. But when we began to treat with the pre&s;ent France, or more pro|perly to pro&s;trate our&s;elves to her, and to try if we &s;hould be admitted to ran&s;om our allies, upon a &s;y&s;tem of mutual conce&s;&s;ion and com|pen&s;ation, we had not one of the u&s;ual facilities. For fir&s;t, we had not the &s;malle&s;t indication of a de&s;ire for peace on the part of the enemy; but
<PB N="77" REF="88">
rather the direct contrary. Men do not make &s;acrifices to obtain what they do not de&s;ire: and as for the balance of power, it was &s;o far from being admitted by France either on the general &s;y&s;tem, or with regard to the particular &s;y&s;tems that I have mentioned, that in the whole body of their authorized or encouraged reports and di&s;cu&s;&s;ions upon the theory of the diplomatic &s;y&s;tem, they con&s;tantly rejected the very idea of the balance of power, and treated it as the true cau&s;e of all the wars and calamities that had afflicted Europe: and their practice was corre&s;pondent to the dogmatick po&s;itions they had laid down. The Empire and the Papacy it was their great object to de&s;troy, and this now openly avowed and &s;tedfa&s;tly acted upon, might have been di&s;cerned with very little acutene&s;s of &s;ight, from the very fir&s;t dawnings of the Re|volution, to be the main drift of their policy. For they profe&s;&s;ed a re&s;olution to de&s;troy every thing which can hold States together by the tie of opinion.</P>
<P>Exploding, therefore, all forts of balances, they avow their de&s;ign to erect them&s;elves into a new de&s;cription of Empire, which is not grounded on any balance, but forms a &s;ort of impious hierarchy, of which France is to be the head and the guardian. The law of this their Empire is any thing rather than the pub|lick
<PB N="78" REF="89">
law of Europe, the antient conventions of it's &s;everal States, or the antient opinions which a&s;&s;ign to them &s;uperiority or pre-eminence of any &s;ort, or any other kind of connexion in vir|tue of antient relations. They permit, and that is all, the temporary exi&s;tence of &s;ome of the old communities; but whil&s;t they give to the&s;e to|lerated States this temporary re&s;pite in order to &s;ecure them in a condition of real dependance on them&s;elves, they inve&s;t them on every &s;ide by a body of Republicks, formed on the model, and dependent o&s;ten&s;ibly, as well as &s;ub&s;tantially, on the will, of the mother Republick, to which they owe their origin. The&s;e are to be &s;o many gar|ri&s;ons to check and controul the States, which are to be permitted to remain on the old model, until they are ripe for a change. It is in this manner that France, on her new &s;y&s;tem, means to form an univer&s;al empire, by producing an uni|ver&s;al revolution. By this means, forming a new code of communities according to what &s;he calls the natural rights of man and of States, &s;he pre|tends to &s;ecure eternal peace to the world, gua|ranteed by her genero&s;ity and ju&s;tice, which are to grow with the extent of her power. To talk of the balance of power to the governors of &s;uch a country, was a jargon which they could not under&s;tand even through an interpreter. Before men can tran&s;act any affair, they mu&s;t have a common language to &s;peak, and &s;ome
<PB N="79" REF="90">
common recogni&s;ed principles on which they can argue, otherwi&s;e all is cro&s;s-purpo&s;e and confu&s;ion. It was, therefore, an e&s;&s;ential pre|liminary to the whole proceeding, to fix, whe|ther the balance of power, the liberties and laws of the Empire, and the treaties of different bel|ligerent powers in pa&s;t times, when they put an end to ho&s;tilities, were to be con&s;idered as the ba&s;is of the pre&s;ent negotiation.</P>
<P>The whole of the enemy's plan was known when Lord Malme&s;bury was &s;ent with his &s;crap of equivalents to Paris. Yet, in this unfortunate attempt at negotiation, in&s;tead of fixing the&s;e points, and a&s;&s;uming the balance of power and the peace of Europe as the ba&s;is to which all ce&s;&s;ions on all &s;ides were to be &s;ub&s;ervient, our &s;olicitor for peace was directed to rever&s;e that order. He was directed to make mutual con|ce&s;&s;ions, on a mere compari&s;on of their market|able value, the ba&s;e of treaty. The balance of power was to be thrown in as an inducement, and a &s;ort of make-weight, to &s;upply the mani|fe&s;t deficiency which mu&s;t &s;tare him and the world in the face, between tho&s;e objects which he was to require the enemy to &s;urrender, and tho&s;e which he had to offer as a fair equivalent.</P>
<P>To give any force to this inducement, and to make it an&s;wer even the &s;econdary purpo&s;e of
<PB N="80" REF="91">
equalizing equivalents having in them&s;elves no natural proportionate value, it &s;uppo&s;ed, that the enemy, contrary to the mo&s;t notorious fact, did admit this balance of power to be of &s;ome value, great or &s;mall; whereas it is plain, that in the enemy's e&s;timate of things, the con&s;ide|ration of the balance of power, as we have &s;aid before, was &s;o far from going in diminution of the value of what the Directory was de&s;ired to &s;urrender, or of giving an additional price to our objects offered in exchange, that the hope of the utter de&s;truction of that balance became, a new motive to the junto of Re|gicides for pre&s;erving, as a means for realizing that hope, what we wi&s;hed them to abandon.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tood the ba&s;is of the treaty on lay|ing the fir&s;t &s;tone of the foundation. At the very be&s;t, upon our &s;ide, the que&s;tion &s;tood upon a mere naked bargain and &s;ale. Unthink|ing people here triumphed when they thought they had obtained it, whereas when obtained as a ba&s;is of a treaty, it was ju&s;t the wor&s;t we could po&s;&s;ibly have cho&s;en. As to our offer to cede a mo&s;t unprofitable, and, indeed, beggarly charge|able counting-hou&s;e or two in the Ea&s;t-Indies, we ought not to pre&s;ume that they would con|&s;ider this as any thing el&s;e than a mockery. As to any thing of real value, we had nothing under
<PB N="81" REF="92">
Heaven to offer (for which we were not our&s;elves in a very dubious &s;truggle) except the I&s;land of Martinico only. When this object was to be weighed again&s;t the directorial conque&s;ts, merely as an object of a value at market, the principle of barter became perfectly ridiculous; a &s;ingle quarter in the &s;ingle city of Am&s;terdam, was worth ten Martinicos; and would have &s;old for many more years purcha&s;e in any market overt in Europe. How was this gro&s;s and glaring de|fect in the objects of exchange to be &s;upplied? &mdash;It was to be made up by argument. And what was that argument?&mdash;The extreme utility of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the We&s;t-Indies to the augmenta|tion of the naval power of France. A very cu|rious topick of argument to be propo&s;ed and in|&s;i&s;ted on by an Amba&s;&s;ador of Great Britain. It is directly and plainly this&mdash;"Come, we know that of all things you wi&s;h a naval power, and it is natural you &s;hould, who wi&s;h to de|&s;troy the very &s;ources of the Briti&s;h greatne&s;s, to overpower our marine, to de&s;troy our commerce, to eradicate our foreign influence, and to lay us open to an inva&s;ion, which, at one &s;troke, may complete our &s;ervitude and ruin, and expunge us from among the nations of the earth. Here I have it in my budget, the infallible arcanum for that purpo&s;e. You are but novices in the art of naval re&s;ources. Let you have the We&s;t-Indies
<PB N="82" REF="93">
back, and your maritime preponderance is &s;e|cured, for which you would do well to be mo|derate in your demands upon the Au&s;trian Ne|therlands."</P>
<P>Under any circum&s;tances, this is a mo&s;t ex|traordinary topick of argument; but it is ren|dered by much the more unaccountable, when we are told, that if the war has been diverted from the great object of e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ociety and good order in Europe by de&s;troying the u&s;ur|pation in France; this diver&s;ion was made to increa&s;e the naval re&s;ources and power of Great-Britain, and to lower, if not annihilate, tho&s;e of the marine of France. I leave all this to the very &s;erious reflexion of every Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>This ba&s;is was no &s;ooner admitted, than the rejection of a treaty upon that &s;ole foundation was a thing of cour&s;e. The enemy did not think it worthy of a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, as in truth it was not; and immediately, as u&s;ual, they began, in the mo&s;t opprobrious, and mo&s;t in&s;olent manner, to que&s;tion our &s;incerity and good faith. Whereas, in truth, there was no one &s;ymptom wanting of openne&s;s and fair dealing. What could be more fair than to lay open to an enemy all that you wi&s;hed to obtain, and the price you meant to pay for it, and to de&s;ire him to imitate your in|genuous
<PB N="83" REF="94">
proceeding, and in the &s;ame manner to open his hone&s;t heart to you. Here was no want of fair dealing, but there was too evidently a fault of another kind; there was much weak|ne&s;s&mdash;there was an eager and impotent de&s;ire of a&s;&s;ociating with this un&s;ocial power, and of at|tempting the connexion by any means, however manife&s;tly feeble and ineffectual. The event was committed to chance; that is, to &s;uch a ma|nife&s;tation of the de&s;ire of France for peace, as would induce the Directory to forget the advan|tages they had in the &s;y&s;tem of barter. Accord|ingly the general de&s;ire for &s;uch a peace was tri|umphantly reported from the moment that Lord Malme&s;bury had &s;et his foot on &s;hore at Calais.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the Directory was com|pelled again&s;t it's will to accept the ba&s;is of barter (as if it that had tended to accelerate the work of pacification!) by the voice of all France. Had this been the ca&s;e, the Directors would have continued to li&s;ten to that voice to which it &s;eems they were &s;o obedient: they would have proceeded with the negotiation upon that ba&s;is. But the fact is, that they in&s;tantly broke up the negotiation, as &s;oon as they had obliged our Amba&s;&s;ador to violate all the principles of trea|ty, and weakly, ra&s;hly, and unguardedly, to ex|po&s;e, without any counter-propo&s;ition, the whole
<PB N="84" REF="95">
of our project with regard to our&s;elves and our allies, and without holding out the &s;malle&s;t hope that they would admit the &s;malle&s;t part of our preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>When they had thus drawn from us all that they could draw out, they expelled Lord Malme&s;bury, and they appealed for the pro|priety of their conduct, to that very France which, we thought proper to &s;uppo&s;e, had driven them to this fine conce&s;&s;ion; and I do not find, that in either divi&s;ion of the family of thieves, the younger branch, or the elder, or in any other body what&s;oever, there was any indignation ex|cited, or any tumult rai&s;ed; or any thing like the virulence of oppo&s;ition which was &s;hewn to the King's Mini&s;ters here, on account of that tran&s;action.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, it &s;eems a hope is &s;till entertained, that the Directory will have that tenderne&s;s for the carca&s;e of their country, by who&s;e very di&s;temper, and on who&s;e fe&s;ter|ing wounds, like vermin, they are fed; that the&s;e pious patriots will of them&s;elves come into a more moderate and rea&s;onable way of thinking and acting. In the name of wonder, what has in&s;pired our Mini&s;try with this hope any more than with their former expectations?</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="96">Do the&s;e hopes only ari&s;e from continual di&s;|appointment? Do they grow out of the u&s;ual grounds of de&s;pair? What is there to encourage them, in the conduct, or even in the declarations of the Ruling Powers in France, from the fir&s;t formation of their mi&s;chievous Republick to the hour in which I write? Is not the Directory com|po&s;ed of the &s;ame junto? Are they not the iden|tical men, who, from the ba&s;e and &s;ordid vices which belonged to their original place and &s;itua|tion, a&s;pired to the dignity of crimes; and from the dirtie&s;t, lowe&s;t, mo&s;t fraudulent, and mo&s;t knavi&s;h of chicaners, a&s;cended in the &s;cale of robbery, &s;acrilege, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination in all it's forms, till at la&s;t they had imbrued their im|pious hands in the blood of their Sovereign? Is it from the&s;e men that we are to hope for this pa|ternal tenderne&s;s to their country, and this &s;a|cred regard for the peace and happine&s;s of all nations?</P>
<P>But it &s;eems there is &s;till another lurking hope, akin to that which duped us &s;o egregiou&s;ly be|fore, when our delightful ba&s;is was accepted: we &s;till flatter our&s;elves that the publick voice of France will compel this Directory to more mo|deration. Whence does this hope ari&s;e? What publick voice is there in France? There are, indeed, &s;ome writers, who, &s;ince this mon&s;ter of
<PB N="86" REF="97">
a Directory has obtained a great regular mili|tary force to guard them, are indulged in a &s;uf|ficient liberty of writing, and &s;ome of them write well undoubtedly. But the world knows that in France there is no publick, that the country is compo&s;ed but of two de&s;criptions; audacious tyrants and trembling &s;laves. The conte&s;ts between the tyrants is the only vital principle that can be di&s;cerned in France. The only thing which there appears like &s;pirit, is among&s;t their late a&s;&s;ociates, and fa&s;te&s;t friends of the Directory&punc; the more furious and untame|able part of the Jacobins. This di&s;contented mem|ber of the faction does almo&s;t balance the reign|ing divi&s;ions; and it threatens every moment to predominate. For the pre&s;ent, however, the dread of their fury forms &s;ome &s;ort of &s;ecurity to their fellows, who now exerci&s;e a more regu|lar, and therefore a &s;omewhat le&s;s ferocious ty|ranny. Mo&s;t of the &s;laves chu&s;e a quiet, how|ever reluctant, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e who are &s;omewhat &s;atiated with blood, and who, like wolves, are a little more tame from being a little le&s;s hungry, in preference to an irruption of the fami&s;hed devourers, who are prowling and howling about the fold.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance a&s;&s;ures &s;ome degree of per|manence to the power of tho&s;e, whom we know
<PB N="87" REF="98">
to be permanently our rancourous and impla|cable enemies. But to tho&s;e very enemies, who have &s;worn our de&s;truction, we have our&s;elves given a further and far better &s;ecurity by ren|dering the cau&s;e of the Royali&s;ts de&s;perate, Tho&s;e brave and virtuous, but unfortunate ad|herents to the ancient con&s;titution of their coun|try, after the mi&s;erable &s;laughters which have been made in that body, after all their lo&s;&s;es by emigration, are &s;till numerous, but unable to exert them&s;elves again&s;t the force of the u&s;ur|pation, evidently countenanced and upheld by tho&s;e very Princes who had called them to arm for the &s;upport of the legal Monarchy. Where then, after chacing the&s;e fleeting hopes of ours from point to point of the political horizon, are they at la&s;t really found? Not where, under Providence, the hopes of Engli&s;hmen u&s;ed to be placed, in our own courage and in our own vir|tues, but in the moderation and virtue of the mo&s;t atrocious mon&s;ters that have ever di&s;graced and plagued mankind.</P>
<P>The only excu&s;e to be made for all our men|dicant diplomacy is the &s;ame as in the ca&s;e of all other mendicancy;&mdash;namely, that it has been founded on ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity. This de&s;erves con&s;ideration. Nece&s;&s;ity, as it has no law, &s;o it has no &s;hame; but moral nece&s;&s;ity is not like
<PB N="88" REF="99">
metaphy&s;ical, or even phy&s;ical. In that category, it is a word of loo&s;e &s;ignification, and conveys different ideas to different minds. To the low-minded, the &s;lighte&s;t nece&s;&s;ity becomes an in|vincible nece&s;&s;ity. <Q>The &s;lothful man &s;aith, There is a lion in the way, and I &s;hall be de|voured in the &s;treets.</Q> But when the nece&s;&s;ity pleaded is not in the nature of things, but in the vices of him who alledges it, the whining tones of common-place beggarly rhetorick, pro|duce nothing but indignation; becau&s;e they indicate a de&s;ire of keeping up a di&s;honourable exi&s;tence, without utility to others, and without dignity to it&s;elf; becau&s;e they aim at obtaining the dues of labour without indu&s;try; and by frauds would draw from the compa&s;&s;ion of others, what men ought to owe to their own &s;pirit and their own exertions.</P>
<P>I am thoroughly &s;atisfied that if we degrade our&s;elves, it is the degradation which will &s;ub|ject us to the yoke of nece&s;&s;ity, and, not that it is nece&s;&s;ity which has brought on our degrada|tion. In this &s;ame chaos, where light and dark|ne&s;s are &s;truggling together, the open &s;ub&s;crip|tion of la&s;t year, with all it's circum&s;tances, mu&s;t have given us no little glimmering of hope; not (as I have heard, it was vainly di&s;cour&s;ed) that the loan could prove a crutch to a lame nego|tiation
<PB N="89" REF="100">
abroad; and that the whiff and wind of it mu&s;t at once have di&s;po&s;ed the enemies of all tranquillity to a de&s;ire for peace. Judging on the face of facts, if on them it had any effect at all, it had the direct contrary effect; for very &s;oon after the loan became publick at Paris, the nego|tiation ended, and our Amba&s;&s;ador was ignomi|niou&s;ly expelled. My view of this was different: I liked the loan, not from the influence which it might have on the enemy, but on account of the temper which it indicated in our own people. This alone is a con&s;ideration of any importance; becau&s;e all calculation, formed upon a &s;uppo&s;ed relation of the habitudes of others to our own, under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, is weak and fallacious. The adver&s;ary mu&s;t be judged, not by what we are, or by what we wi&s;h him to be, but by what we mu&s;t know he actually is; unle&s;s we choo&s;e to &s;hut our eyes and our ears to the uniform tenour of all his di&s;cour&s;es, and to his uniform cour&s;e in all his actions. We may be deluded; but we cannot pretend that we have been di&s;appointed. The old rule of, <HI>Ne te quae|&s;iveris extra,</HI> is a precept as available in policy as it is in morals. Let us leave off &s;peculating upon the di&s;po&s;ition and the wants of the ene|my. Let us de&s;cend into our own bo&s;oms; let us a&s;k our&s;elves what are our duties, and what are our means of di&s;charging them. In what
<PB N="90" REF="101">
heart are you at home? How far may an Engli&s;h Mini&s;ter confide in the affections, in the con|fidence, in the force of an Engli&s;h people? What does he find us when he puts us to the proof of what Engli&s;h intere&s;t and Engli&s;h honour de|mand? It is, as furni&s;hing an an&s;wer to the&s;e que&s;tions that I con&s;ider the circum&s;tances of the loan. The effect on the enemy is not in what he may &s;peculate on our re&s;ources, but in what he &s;hall feel from our arms.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of the loan have proved beyond a doubt three capital points, which, if they are properly u&s;ed, may be advantageous to the future liberty and happine&s;s of man|kind. In the fir&s;t place, the loan demon|&s;trates, in regard to in&s;trumental re&s;ources, the competency of this kingdom to the a&s;&s;ertion of the common cau&s;e, and to the maintenance and &s;uperintendance of that, which it is it's duty, and it's glory to hold, and to watch over&mdash;the balance of power throughout the Chri&s;tian World. Se|condly, it brings to light what, under the mo&s;t di&s;couraging appearances, I always reckoned on; that with it's ancient phy&s;ical force, not only unimpaired, but augmented, it's ancient &s;pirit is &s;till alive in the Briti&s;h nation. It proves, that for their application there is a &s;pirit equal to the re&s;ources, for it's energy above them. It
<PB N="91" REF="102">
proves that there exi&s;ts, though not always vi|&s;ible, a &s;pirit which never fails to come forth whenever it is ritually invoked; a &s;pirit which will give no equivocal re&s;pon&s;e, but &s;uch as will hearten the timidity, and fix the irre&s;olution of he&s;itating prudence; a &s;pirit which will be ready to perform all the ta&s;ks that &s;hall be impo&s;ed upon it by publick honour. Thirdly, the loan di&s;plays an abundant confidence in his Maje&s;ty's Government, as admini&s;tered by his pre&s;ent &s;er|vants, in the pro&s;ecution of a war which the people con&s;ider, not as a war made on the &s;ug|ge&s;tion of Mini&s;ters, and to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of the ambition or pride of &s;tate&s;men, but as a war of their own, and in defence of that very property which they expend for it's &s;upport; a war for that order of things, from which every thing valuable that they po&s;&s;e&s;s is derived, and in which order alone it can po&s;&s;ibly be main|tained.</P>
<P>I hear in derogation of the value of the fact, from which I draw inferences &s;o favourable to the &s;pirit of the people, and to it's ju&s;t expecta|tion from Mini&s;ters, that the eighteen million loan is to be con&s;idered in no other light, than as taking advantage of a very lucrative bargain held out to the &s;ub&s;cribers. I do not in truth believe it. All the circum&s;tances which attend|ed
<PB N="92" REF="103">
the &s;ub&s;cription &s;trongly &s;poke a different language. Be it, however, as the&s;e detractors &s;ay. This with me derogates little, or rather nothing at all, from the political value and im|portance of the fact. I &s;hould be very &s;orry if the tran&s;action was not &s;uch a bargain, other|wi&s;e it would not have been a fair one. A cor|rupt and improvident loan, like every thing el&s;e corrupt or prodigal, cannot be too much condemned; but there is a &s;hort-&s;ighted par|&s;imony &s;till more fatal than an unfore&s;eeing expence. The value of money mu&s;t be judged like every thing el&s;e from it's rate at market. To force that market, or any market, is of all things the mo&s;t dangerous. For a &s;mall temporary benefit, the &s;pring of all public credit might be relaxed for ever. The monied men have a right to look to advantage in the inve&s;t|ment of their property. To advance their mo|ney, they ri&s;k it; and the ri&s;k is to be included in the price. If they were to incur a lo&s;s, that lo&s;s would amount to a tax on that peculiar &s;pecies of property. In effect, it would be the mo&s;t unju&s;t and impolitick of all things, unequal taxation. It would throw upon one de&s;cription of per&s;ons in the community, that burthen which ought by fair and equitable di&s;tribution to re&s;t upon the whole. None on account of their dig|nity &s;hould be exempt; none (pre&s;erving due
<PB N="93" REF="104">
proportion) on account of the &s;cantine&s;s of their means. The moment a man is exempted from the maintenance of the community, he is in a &s;ort &s;eparated from it. He lo&s;es the place of a citizen.</P>
<P>So it is in all <HI>taxation</HI>; but in a <HI>bargain,</HI> when terms of lo&s;s are looked for by the borrower from the lender, compul&s;ion, or what virtually is compul&s;ion, introduces it&s;elf into the place of treaty. When compul&s;ion may be at all u&s;ed by a State in borrowing, the occa&s;ion mu&s;t de|termine. But the compul&s;ion ought to be known, and well defined, and well di&s;tingui&s;h|ed: for otherwi&s;e treaty only weakens the ener|gy of compul&s;ion, while compul&s;ion de&s;troys the freedom of a bargain. The advantage of both is lo&s;t by the confu&s;ion of things in their nature utterly un&s;ociable. It would be to intro|duce compul&s;ion into that in which freedom and exi&s;tence are the &s;ame; I mean credit. The moment that &s;hame, or fear, or force, are di|rectly or indirectly applied to a loan, credit peri&s;hes.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t be &s;ome impul&s;e be&s;ides public &s;pirit, to put private intere&s;t into motion along with it. Monied men ought to be allowed to &s;et a value on their money; if they did not,
<PB N="94" REF="105">
there could be no monied men. This de&s;ire of accumulation, is a principle without which the means of their &s;ervice to the State could not exi&s;t. The love of lucre, though &s;ometimes car|ried to a ridiculous, &s;ometimes to a vicious ex|ce&s;s, is the grand cau&s;e of pro&s;perity to all States. In this natural, this rea&s;onable, this powerful, this prolifick principle, it is for the &s;atyri&s;t to ex|po&s;e the ridiculous; it is for the morali&s;t to cen&s;ure the vicious; it is for the &s;ympathetick heart to reprobate the hard and cruel; it is for the Judge to animadvert on the fraud, the ex|tortion, and the oppre&s;&s;ion: but it is for the State&s;man to employ it as he finds it, with all it's concomitant exITEMencies, with all it's im|perfections on it's head. It is his part, in this ca&s;e, as it is in all other ca&s;es, where he is to make u&s;e of the general energies of nature, to take them as he finds them.</P>
<P>After all, it is a great mi&s;take to imagine, as too commonly, almo&s;t indeed generally, it is imagined, that the publick borrower and the private lender, are two adver&s;e parties with dif|ferent and contending intere&s;ts: and that what is given to the one, is wholly taken from the other. Con&s;tituted as our &s;y&s;tem of finance and taxation is, the intere&s;ts of the contracting par|ties cannot well be &s;eparated, whatever they may
<PB N="95" REF="106">
reciprocally intend. He who is the hard lender of to-day, to-morrow is the generous contri|butor to his own payment. For example, the la&s;t loan is rai&s;ed on publick taxes, which are de|&s;igned to produce annually two millions &s;terling. At fir&s;t view, this is an annuity of two millions dead charge upon the publick in favour of cer|tain monied men: but in&s;pect the thing more nearly, follow the &s;tream in it's meanders; and you will find that there is a good deal of fallacy in this &s;tate of things.</P>
<P>I take it, that whoever con&s;iders any man's expenditure of his income, old or new (I &s;peak of certain cla&s;&s;es in life) will find a full third of it to go in taxes, direct or indirect. If &s;o, this new-created income of two millions will pro|bly furni&s;h 665,000l. (I avoid broken num|bers) towards the payment of it's own intere&s;t, or to the &s;inking of it's own capital. So it is with the whole of the publick debt. Suppo&s;e it any given &s;um, it is a fallacious e&s;timate of the affairs of a nation to con&s;ider it as a mere bur|then; to a degree it is &s;o without que&s;tion, but not wholly &s;o, nor any thing like it. If the income from the intere&s;t be &s;pent, the above proportion returns again into the publick &s;tock: in&s;omuch, that taking the intere&s;t of the whole debt to be twelve million, three hundred thou|&s;and
<PB N="96" REF="107">
pound, (it is &s;omething more) not le&s;s than a &s;um of four million one hundred thou|&s;and pound comes back again to the publick through the channel of impo&s;ition. If the whole, or any part, of that income be &s;aved, &s;o much new capital is generated; the infallible operation of which is to lower the value of money, and con&s;equently to conduce towards the improve|ment of publick credit.</P>
<P>I take the expenditure of the <HI>capitali&s;t,</HI> not the value of the capital, as my &s;tandard; becau&s;e it is the &s;tandard upon which among&s;t us, pro|perty as an object of taxation, is rated. In this country, land and offices only excepted, we rai&s;e no faculty tax. We pre&s;erve the faculty from the expence. Our taxes, for the far greater portion, fly over the heads of the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es. They e&s;cape too who, with better ability, vo|luntarily &s;ubject them&s;elves to the har&s;h di&s;ci|pline of a rigid nece&s;&s;ity. With us, labour and frugality, the parents of riches, are &s;pread, and wi&s;ely too. The moment men cea&s;e to augment the common &s;tock, the moment they no longer enrich it by their indu&s;try or their &s;elf-denial, their luxury and even their ea&s;e are obliged to pay contribution to the publick; not becau&s;e they are vicious principles, but becau&s;e they are unproductive. If, in fact, the intere&s;t paid by
<PB N="97" REF="108">
the publick had not thus revolved again into it's own fund; if this &s;ecretion had not again been ab&s;orbed into the ma&s;s of blood, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for the nation to have exi&s;ted to this time under &s;uch a debt. But under the debt it does exi&s;t and flouri&s;h; and this flou|ri&s;hing &s;tate of exi&s;tence in no &s;mall degree is owing to the contribution from the debt to the payment. Whatever, therefore, is taken from that capital by too clo&s;e a bargain, is but a de|lu&s;ive advantage, it is &s;o much lo&s;t to the pub|lick in another way. This matter cannot on the one &s;ide or the other, be metaphy&s;ically pur&s;ued to the extreme, but it is a con&s;ideration of which, in all di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of this kind, we ought never wholly to lo&s;e &s;ight.</P>
<P>It is never, therefore, wi&s;e to quarrel with the intere&s;ted views of men, whil&s;t they are com|bined with the publick intere&s;t and promote it: it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to tie the knot, if po&s;&s;ible, clo&s;er. Re&s;ources that are derived from extraor|dinary virtues, as &s;uch virtues are rare, &s;o they mu&s;t be unproductive. <Q>It is a good thing for a monied man to pledge his property on the welfare of his country; he &s;hews that he places his trea&s;ure where his heart is; and, revolving in this circle, we know that <Q>wherever a man's trea&s;ure is, there his heart will be al&s;o</Q> For
<PB N="98" REF="109">
the&s;e rea&s;ons and on the&s;e principles, I have been &s;orry to &s;ee the attempts which have been made, with more good meaning than fore&s;ight and con&s;ideration, towards rai&s;ing the annual intere&s;t of this loan by private contributions.</Q> Wherever a regular revenue is e&s;tabli&s;hed, there voluntary contribution can an&s;wer no purpo&s;e, but to di&s;order and di&s;turb it in it's cour&s;e. To recur to &s;uch aids is, for &s;o much to di&s;|&s;olve the community, and to return to a &s;tate of unconnected nature. And even if &s;uch a &s;upply &s;hould be productive, in a degree com|men&s;urate to it's object, it mu&s;t al&s;o be pro|ductive of much vexation, and much oppre&s;|&s;ion. Either the citizens, by the propo&s;ed du|ties, pay their proportion according to &s;ome rate made by publick authority, or they do not. If the law be well made, and the contributions founded on ju&s;t proportions, every thing &s;uper|added by &s;omething that is not as regular as law, and as uniform in it's operation, will be|come more or le&s;s out of proportion. If, on the contrary, the law be not made upon proper calculation, it is a di&s;grace to the publick wi&s;|dom, which fails in &s;kill to a&s;&s;e&s;s the citizen in ju&s;t mea&s;ure, and according to his means. But the hand of authority is not always the mo&s;t heavy hand. It is obvious, that men may be oppre&s;&s;ed by many ways, be&s;ides tho&s;e which
<PB N="99" REF="110">
take their cour&s;e from the &s;upreme power of the State. Suppo&s;e the payment to be wholly di&s;cretionary. Whatever has it's origin in ca|price, is &s;ure not to improve in it's progre&s;s, nor to end in rea&s;on. It is impo&s;&s;ible for each private individual to have any mea&s;ure conformable to the particular condition of each of his fellow-citizens, or to the general exi|gencies of his country. 'Tis a random &s;hot at be&s;t.</P>
<P>When men proceed in this irregular mode, the fir&s;t contributor is apt to grow peevi&s;h with his neighbours. He is but too well di&s;|po&s;ed to mea&s;ure their means by his own envy, and not by the real &s;tate of their fortunes, which he can rarely know, and which it may in them be an act of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t imprudence to reveal. Hence the odium and la&s;&s;itude, with which people will look upon a provi&s;ion for the pub|lick, which is bought by di&s;cord at the expence of &s;ocial quiet. Hence the bitter heart-burn|ings, and the war of tongues which is &s;o often the prelude to other wars. Nor is it every con|tribution, called voluntary, which is according to the free will of the giver. A fal&s;e &s;hame, or a fal&s;e glory, again&s;t his feelings, and his judgment, may tax an individual to the detri|ment of his family, and in wrong of his credi|tors.
<PB N="100" REF="111">
A pretence of publick &s;pirit may di&s;able him from the performance of his private duties. It may di&s;able him even from paying the legiti|mate contributions which he is to furni&s;h ac|cording to the pre&s;cript of law; but what is the mo&s;t dangerous of all is, that malignant di&s;po&s;i|tion to which this mode of contribution evi|dently tends, and which at length leaves the comparatively indigent, to judge of the wealth, and to pre&s;cribe to the opulent, or tho&s;e whom they conceive to be &s;uch, the u&s;e they are to make of their fortunes. From thence it is but one &s;tep to the &s;ubver&s;ion of all property.</P>
<P>Far, very far am I from &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;uch things enter into the purpo&s;es of tho&s;e excel|lent per&s;ons who&s;e zeal has led them to this kind of mea&s;ure; but the mea&s;ure it&s;elf will lead them beyond their intention, and what is begun with the be&s;t de&s;igns, bad men will perver&s;ely improve to the wor&s;t of their purpo&s;es. An ill-founded plau&s;ibility in great affairs is a real evil. In France we have &s;een the wickede&s;t and mo&s;t fooli&s;h of men, the Con&s;titution-mongers of 1789, pur&s;uing this very cour&s;e, and ending in this very event. The&s;e projectors of deception &s;et on foot two modes of voluntary contribu|tion to the &s;tate. The fir&s;t, they called patrio|tick gifts. The&s;e, for the greater part were not
<PB N="101" REF="112">
more ridiculous in the mode, than contemptible in the project. The other, which they called the patriotick contribution, was expected to amount to a fourth of the fortunes of indi|viduals, but at their own will and on their own e&s;timate; but this contribution threatening to fall infinitely &s;hort of their hopes, they &s;oon made it compul&s;ory, both in the rate and in the levy, beginning in fraud and ending, as all the frauds of power end, in plain violence. All the&s;e devices to produce an involuntary will, were under the pretext of relieving the more indigent cla&s;&s;es, but the principle of voluntary contribu|tion, however delu&s;ive, being once e&s;tabli&s;hed, the&s;e lower cla&s;&s;es fir&s;t, and then all cla&s;&s;es, were encouraged to throw off the regular methodical payments to the State as &s;o many badges of &s;la|very. Thus all regular revenue failing, the&s;e impo&s;tors rai&s;ing the &s;uper&s;tructure on the &s;ame cheats with which they had laid the foundation of their greatne&s;s, and not content with a por|tion of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the rich, confi&s;cated the whole, and to prevent them from reclaim|ing their rights, murdered the proprietors. The whole of the proce&s;s has pa&s;&s;ed before our eyes, and been conducted indeed with a greater de|gree of rapidity than could be expected.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="113">My opinion then is, that publick contribu|tions ought only to be rai&s;ed by the publick will. By the judicious form of our con&s;titution, the pu|blick contribution is in it's name and &s;ub&s;tance a grant. In it's origin it is truly voluntary; not voluntary, according to the irregular, un&s;teady, capricious will of individuals, but according to the will and wi&s;dom of the whole popular ma&s;s, in the only way in which will and wi&s;dom can go together. This voluntary grant obtaining in it's progre&s;s the force of a law, a general nece&s;&s;ity which takes away all merit, and con&s;equently all jealou&s;y from individuals, compre&s;&s;es, equal|izes, and &s;atisfies the whole; &s;uffering no man to judge of his neighbour, or to arrogate any thing to him&s;elf. If their will complies with their obligation, the great end is an&s;wered in the happie&s;t mode; if the will re&s;i&s;ts the burthen, every one lo&s;es a great part of his own will as a common lot. After all, perhaps contributions rai&s;ed by a charge on luxury, or that degree of convenience which approaches &s;o near as to be confounded with luxury, is the only mode of contribution which may be with truth termed voluntary.</P>
<P>I might re&s;t here, and take the loan I &s;peak of as leading to a &s;olution of that que&s;tion,
<PB N="103" REF="114">
which I propo&s;ed in my fir&s;t letter: "Whether the inability of the country to pro&s;ecute the war, did nece&s;&s;itate a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the indigni|ties and the calamities of a Peace with the Re|gicide Power." But give me leave to pur&s;ue this point a little further.</P>
<P>I know that it has been a cry u&s;ual on this occa&s;ion, as it has been upon occa&s;ions where &s;uch a cry could have le&s;s apparent ju&s;tification, that great di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery have been the con|&s;equence of this war, by the burthens brought and laid upon the people. But to know where the burthen really lies, and where it pre&s;&s;es, we mu&s;t divide the people. As to the common peo|ple, their &s;tock is in their per&s;ons and in their earnings. I deny that the &s;tock of their per&s;ons is dimini&s;hed in a greater proportion than the common &s;ources of populou&s;ne&s;s abundantly fill up; I mean con&s;tant employment; proportioned pay according to the produce of the &s;oil, and where the &s;oil fails, according to the operation of the general capital; plentiful nouri&s;hment to vigorous labour; comfortable provi&s;ion to de|crepid age, to orphan infancy, and to accidental malady. I &s;ay nothing to the policy of the provi|&s;ion for the poor, in all the variety of faces under which it pre&s;ents it&s;elf. This is the matter of another enquiry. I only ju&s;t &s;peak of it as of a
<PB N="104" REF="115">
fact, taken with others, to &s;upport me in my denial that hitherto any one of the ordinary &s;ources of the increa&s;e of mankind is dried up by this war. I affirm, what I can well prove, that the wa&s;te has been le&s;s than the &s;upply. To &s;ay that in war no man mu&s;t be killed, is to &s;ay that there ought to be no war. This they may &s;ay, who wi&s;h to talk idly, and who would di&s;|play their humanity at the expence of their ho|ne&s;ty, or their under&s;tanding. If more lives are lo&s;t in this war than nece&s;&s;ity requires, they are lo&s;t by mi&s;conduct or mi&s;take, but if the ho&s;|tility be ju&s;t, the errour is to be corrected: the war is not to be abandoned.</P>
<P>That the &s;tock of the common people, in numbers is not le&s;&s;ened, any more than the cau&s;es are impaired, is manife&s;t, without being at the pains of an actual numeration. An improved and improving agriculture, which implies a great augmentation of labour, has not yet found it&s;elf at a &s;tand, no, not for a &s;ingle moment, for want of the nece&s;&s;ary hands, either in the &s;ettled progre&s;s of hu&s;bandry, or in the occa|&s;ional pre&s;&s;ure of harve&s;ts. I have even rea&s;on to believe that there has been a much &s;maller importation, or the demand of it, from a neigh|bouring kingdom than in former times, when agriculture was more limited in it's extent and
<PB N="105" REF="116">
it's means, and when the time was a &s;ea&s;on of profound peace. On the contrary, the prolifick fertility of country life has poured it's &s;uper|fluity of population into the canals, and into other publick works which of late years have been undertaken to &s;o amazing an extent, and which have not only not been di&s;continued, but beyond all expectation pu&s;hed on with re|doubled vigour, in a war that calls for &s;o many of our men, and &s;o much of our riches. An increa&s;ing capital calls for labour: and an in|crea&s;ing population an&s;wers to the call. Our manufactures augmented both for the &s;upply of foreign and dome&s;tick con&s;umption, re|producing with the means of life, the multi|tudes which they u&s;e and wa&s;te, (and which many of them devour much more &s;urely and much more largely than the war) have always found the laborious hand ready for the liberal pay. That the price of the &s;oldier is highly rai&s;ed is true. In part this ri&s;e may be owing to &s;ome mea&s;ures not &s;o well con&s;idered in the beginning of this war, but the grand cau&s;e has been the reluctence of that cla&s;s of people from whom the &s;oldiery is taken, to enter into a mi|litary life, not that but once entered into, it has it's conveniences, and even it's plea&s;ures. I have &s;eldom, known a &s;oldier who, at the in|terce&s;&s;ion of his friends, and at their no &s;mall
<PB N="106" REF="117">
charge, had been redeemed from that di&s;cipline, that in a &s;hort time, was not eager to return to it again. But the true rea&s;on is the abun|dant occupation, and the augmented &s;tipend found in towns, and villages, and farms, which leaves a &s;maller number of per&s;ons to be di&s;|po&s;ed of. The price of men for new and un|tried ways of life, mu&s;t bear a proportion to the profits of that mode of exi&s;tence from whence they are to be bought.</P>
<P>So far as to the &s;tock of the common people, as it con&s;i&s;ts in their per&s;ons. As to the other part, which con&s;i&s;ts in their earnings, I have to &s;ay, that the rates of wages are very greatly aug|mented almo&s;t through the kingdom. In the pari&s;h where I live, it has been rai&s;ed from &s;even to nine &s;hillings in the week for the &s;ame la|bourer, performing the &s;ame ta&s;k, and no greater. Except &s;omething in the malt taxes, and the duties upon &s;ugars, I do not know any one tax impo&s;ed for very many years pa&s;t which affects the labourer in any degree what&s;oever; while on the other hand, the tax upon hou&s;es not having more than &s;even windows (that is, upon cottages) was repealed the very year before the commencement of the pre&s;ent war. On the whole, I am &s;atisfied, that the humble&s;t cla&s;s, and that cla&s;s which touches the mo&s;t
<PB N="107" REF="118">
nearly on the lowe&s;t, out of which it is continu|ally emerging, and to which it is continually falling, receives far more from publick impo&s;i|tions than it pays. That cla&s;s receives two mil|lion &s;terling annually from the cla&s;&s;es above it. It pays to no &s;uch amount towards any publick contribution.</P>
<P>I hope it is not nece&s;&s;ary for me to take no|tice of that language, &s;o ill &s;uited to the per&s;ons to whom it has been attributed, and &s;o unbe|coming the place in which it is &s;aid to have been uttered, concerning the pre&s;ent war as the cau&s;e of the high price of provi&s;ions during the greater part of the year 1796. I pre&s;ume it is only to be a&s;cribed to the intolerable licence with which the new&s;papers break not only the rules of deco|rum in real life, but even the dramatick decorum, when they per&s;onate great men, and, like bad poets, make the heroes of the piece talk more like us Grub-&s;treet &s;cribblers, than in a &s;tyle con&s;onant to per&s;ons of gravity and importance in the State. It was ea&s;y to demon&s;trate the cau&s;e, and the &s;ole cau&s;e, of that ri&s;e in the grand ar|ticle and fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary of life. It would ap|pear that it had no more connexion with the war, than the moderate price to which all &s;orts of grain were reduced, &s;oon after the return of Lord Malme&s;bury, had with the &s;tate of po|ticks
<PB N="108" REF="119">
and the fate of his Lord&s;hip's treaty. I have quite as good rea&s;on (that is, no rea&s;on at all) to attribute this abundance to the longer continuance of the war, as the gentlemen who per&s;onate leading Members of Parliament, have had for giving the enhanced price to that war, at a more early period of it's duration. Oh, the folly of us poor creatures, who, in the mid&s;t of our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, or our e&s;capes, are ready to claw or care&s;s one another, upon matters that &s;o &s;el|dom depend on our wi&s;dom or our weakne&s;s, on our good or evil conduct towards each other!</P>
<P>An untimely &s;hower, or an un&s;ea&s;onable drought; a fro&s;t too long continued, or too &s;uddenly broken up, with rain and tempe&s;t; the blight of the &s;pring, or the &s;mut of the harve&s;t; will do more to cau&s;e the di&s;tre&s;s of the belly, than all the contrivances of all State&s;men can do to relieve it. Let Government protect and en|courage indu&s;try, &s;ecure property, repre&s;s vio|lence, and di&s;countenance fraud, it is all that they have to do. In other re&s;pects, the le&s;s they meddle in the&s;e affairs the better; the re&s;t is in the hands of our Ma&s;ter and theirs. We are in a con&s;titution of things wherein&mdash;<Q>Modo &s;ol nimius, modo corripit imber.</Q> But I will pu&s;h this matter no further. As I have &s;aid a good deal upon it at various times during my

publick &s;ervice, and I have lately written &s;ome|thing on it, which may yet &s;ee the light, I &s;hall content my&s;elf now with ob&s;erving, that the vigorous and laborious cla&s;s of life has lately got from the <HI>bon ton</HI> of the humanity of this day, the name of the <HI>"labouring poor."</HI> We have heard many plans for the relief of the <HI>"Labour|ing Poor."</HI> This puling jargon is not as inno|cent as it is fooli&s;h. In meddling with great affairs, weakne&s;s is never innoxious. Hitherto the name of Poor (in the &s;en&s;e in which it is u&s;ed to excite compa&s;&s;ion) has not been u&s;ed for tho&s;e who can, but for tho&s;e who cannot labour&mdash;for the &s;ick and infirm; for orphan in|fancy; for langui&s;hing and decrepid age: but when we affect to pity as poor, tho&s;e who mu&s;t labour or the world cannot exi&s;t, we are trifling with the condition of mankind. It is the com|mon doom of man that he mu&s;t eat his bread by the &s;weat of his brow, that is, by the &s;weat of his body, or the &s;weat of his mind. If this toil was inflicted as a cur&s;e, it is as might be expected from the cur&s;es of the Father of all Ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;it is tempered with many alleviations, many comforts. Every at|tempt to fly from it, and to refu&s;e the very terms of our exi&s;tence, becomes much more truly a cur&s;e, and heavier pains and penalties fall upon tho&s;e who would elude the ta&s;ks which are put
<PB N="110" REF="121">
upon them by the great Ma&s;ter Workman of the World, who in his dealings with his crea|tures &s;ympathizes with their weakne&s;s, and &s;peaking of a creation wrought by mere will out of nothing, &s;peaks of &s;ix days of <HI>labour</HI> and one of <HI>re&s;t.</HI> I do not call a healthy young man, chearful in his mind, and vigorous in his arms, I cannot call &s;uch a man, <HI>poor</HI>; I cannot pity my kind as a kind, merely becau&s;e they are men. This affected pity, only tends to di&s;|&s;atisfy them with their condition, and to teach them to &s;eek re&s;ources where no re&s;ources are to be found, in &s;omething el&s;e than their own indu&s;try, and frugality, and &s;obriety. What|ever may be the intention (which, becau&s;e I do not know, I cannot di&s;pute) of tho&s;e who would di&s;content mankind by this &s;trange pity, they act towards us in the con&s;equences, as if they were our wor&s;t enemies.</P>
<P>In turning our view from the lower to the higher cla&s;&s;es, it will not be nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;hew at any length that the &s;tock of the latter, as it con&s;i&s;ts in their numbers, has not yet &s;uf|fered any material diminution. I have not &s;een, or heard it a&s;&s;erted: I have no rea&s;on to believe it: there is no want of officers, that I have ever under&s;tood, for the new &s;hips which we com|mi&s;&s;ion, or the new regiments which we rai&s;e.

In the nature of things it is not with their per|&s;ons, that the higher cla&s;&s;es principally pay their contingent to the demands of war. There is another, and not le&s;s important, part which re&s;ts with almo&s;t exclu&s;ive weight upon them. They furni&s;h the means,

Not that they are exempt from contributing al&s;o by their per&s;onal &s;ervice in the fleets and armies of their country. They do contribute, and in their full and fair proportion, according to the relative proportion of their numbers in the commu|nity. They contribute all the mind that actu|ates the whole machine. The fortitude re|quired of them, is very different from the un|thinking alacrity of the common &s;oldier, or common &s;ailor, in the face of danger and death; it is not a pa&s;&s;ion, it is not an impul&s;e, it is not a &s;entiment; it is a cool, &s;teady, deliberate principle, always pre&s;ent, always equable; hav|ing no connexion with anger; tempering ho|nour with prudence; incited, invigorated, and &s;u&s;tained by a generous love of fame; informed, moderated and directed by an enlarged know|ledge of it's own great publick ends; flowing in one blended &s;tream from the oppo&s;ite &s;ources of the heart and the head; carrying in it&s;elf it's own commi&s;&s;ion, and proving it's title to every

other command, by the fir&s;t and mo&s;t difficult command, that of the bo&s;om in which it re&s;ides: it is a fortitude, which unites with the courage of the field the more exalted and refined courage of the council; which knows, as well to retreat as to advance; which can conquer as well by de|lay, as by the rapidity of a march, or the impe|tuo&s;ity of an attack; which can be, with Fabius, the black cloud that lowers on the tops of the mountains, or with Scipio, the thunderbolt of war; which undi&s;mayed by fal&s;e &s;hame, can patiently endure the &s;evere&s;t trial that a gallant &s;pirit can undergo, in the taunts and provocations of the enemy, the &s;u&s;picions, the cold re&s;pect, and "mouth-honour" of tho&s;e, from whom it &s;hould meet a cheerful obedience; which undi&s;|turbed by fal&s;e humanity, can calmly a&s;&s;ume that mo&s;t aweful moral re&s;pon&s;ibility of decid|ing, when victory may be too dearly purcha&s;ed by the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle life, and when the &s;afety and glory of their country may demand the cer|tain &s;acrifice of thou&s;ands. Different &s;tations of command may call for different modifications of this fortitude, but the character ought to be the &s;ame in all. And never in the mo&s;t "palmy &s;tate" of our martial renown did it &s;hine with brighter lu&s;tre than in the pre&s;ent &s;anguinary and ferocious ho&s;tilities, wherever the Briti&s;h arms have been carried. But, in this mo&s;t arduous, and momentous conflict, which from
<PB N="113" REF="124">
it's nature &s;hould have rou&s;ed us to new and unexampled efforts, I know not how it has been, that we have never put forth half the &s;trength, which we have exerted in ordinary wars. In the fatal battles, which have drenched the Continent with blood, and &s;haken the &s;y&s;tem of Europe to pieces, we have never had any con&s;iderable army of a magnitude to be compared to the lea&s;t of tho&s;e by which, in former times, we &s;o gloriou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted our place as protectors, not oppre&s;&s;ors, at the head of the great Commonwealth of Eu|rope. We have never manfully met the danger in front; and when the enemy, re&s;igning to us our natural dominion of the ocean, and aban|doning the defence of his di&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to the infernal energy of the de&s;troying principles, which he had planted there&punc; for the &s;ubver&s;ion of the neighbouring Colonies, drove forth by one &s;weeping law of unprecedented de&s;poti&s;m, his armed multitudes on every &s;ide, to overwhelm the Countries and States, which had for centuries &s;tood the firm barriers again&s;t the ambition of France; we drew back the arm of our military force, which had never been more than half rai&s;ed to oppo&s;e him. From that time we have been combating only with the other arm of our naval power; the right arm of England I admit; but which &s;truck almo&s;t unre&s;i&s;ted, with blows, that could never reach the heart of the ho&s;tile mi&s;chief.
<PB N="114" REF="125">
From that time, without a &s;ingle effort to re|gain tho&s;e outworks, which ever till now we &s;o &s;trenuoufly maintained, as the &s;trong frontier of our own dignity and &s;afety, no le&s;s than the liber|ties of Europe; with but one feeble attempt to &s;uccour tho&s;e brave, faithful, and numerous allies, whom for the fir&s;t time &s;ince the days of our Ed|wards and Henrys, we now have in the bo&s;om of France it&s;elf; we have been intrenching, and fortifying, and garri&s;oning our&s;elves at home: we have been redoubling &s;ecurity on &s;ecurity, to pro|tect our&s;elves from inva&s;ion, which has now fir&s;t become to us a &s;erious object of alarm and terrour. Alas! the few of us, who have pro|tracted life in any mea&s;ure near to the extreme limits of our &s;hort period, have been condemned to &s;ee &s;trange things; new &s;y&s;tems of policy, new principles, and not only new men, but what might appear a new &s;pecies of men. I believe that any per&s;on who was of age to take a part in publick affairs forty years ago (if the intermediate &s;pace of time were expunged from his memory) would hardly credit his &s;en&s;es, when he &s;hould hear from the highe&s;t authority, that an army of two hundred thou&s;and men was kept up in this i&s;land, and that in the neighbouring i&s;land there were at lea&s;t four&s;core thou&s;and more. But when he had recovered from his &s;urpri&s;e on being told of this army, which has not it's parallel, what mu&s;t
<PB N="115" REF="126">
be his a&s;toni&s;hment to be told again, that this mighty force was kept up for the mere purpo&s;e of an inert and pa&s;&s;ive defence, and that, in it's far greater part, it was di&s;abled by it's con&s;titution and very e&s;&s;ence, from defending us again&s;t an enemy by any one preventive &s;troke, or any one opera|tion of active ho&s;tility? What mu&s;t his reflexions be, on learning further, that a fleet of five hundred men of war, the be&s;t appointed, and to the full as ably commanded as this country ever had upon the &s;ea, was for the greater part employed in car|rying on the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of unenterpri&s;ing de|fence? What mu&s;t be the &s;entiments and feelings of one, who remembers the former energy of Eng|land, when he is given to under&s;tand, that the&s;e two i&s;lands, with their exten&s;ive, and every where vulnerable coa&s;t, &s;hould be con&s;idered as a garri|&s;oned &s;ea-town; what would &s;uch a man, what would any man think, if the garri&s;on of &s;o &s;trange a fortre&s;s &s;hould be &s;uch, and &s;o feebly command|ed, as never to make a &s;ally; and that, contrary to all which has hitherto been &s;een in war, an in|finitely inferiour army, with the &s;hattered relicks of an almo&s;t annihilated navy, ill found, and ill man|ned, may with &s;afety be&s;iege this &s;uperiour garri|&s;on, and without hazarding the life of a man, ruin the place, merely by the menaces and fal&s;e appear|ances of an attack?

<P>The other cau&s;es, which &s;ometimes affect the numbers of the lower cla&s;&s;es, but which I have &s;hewn not to have exi&s;ted to any &s;uch degree dur|ing this war,&mdash;penury, cold, hunger, nakedne&s;s,&mdash; do not ea&s;ily reach the higher orders of &s;ociety. I do not dread for them the &s;lighte&s;t ta&s;te of the&s;e calamities from the di&s;tre&s;s and pre&s;&s;ure of the war. They have much more to dread in that way from the confi&s;cations, the rapines, the burnings, and the ma&s;&s;acres, that may follow in the train of a peace, which &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h the deva&s;tating and de|populating principles and example of the French Regicides, in &s;ecurity, and triumph and dominion.
<PB N="117" REF="128">
In the ordinary cour&s;e of human affairs, any check to population among men in ea&s;e and opulence, is le&s;s to be apprehended from what they may &s;uffer, than from what they enjoy. Peace is more likely to be injurious to them in that re&s;pect than war. The exce&s;&s;es of delicacy, repo&s;e, and &s;atiety, are as unfavourable as the extremes of hard&s;hip, toil, and want, to the increa&s;e and multiplication of our kind. Indeed, the abu&s;e of the bounties of Na|ture, much more &s;urely than any partial privation of them, tends to intercept that precious boon of a &s;econd and dearer life in our progeny, which was be&s;towed in the fir&s;t great command to man from the All-gracious Giver of all, who&s;e name be ble&s;&s;ed, whether he gives or takes away. His hand, in every page of his book, has written the le&s;&s;on of moderation. Our phy&s;ical well-being, our moral worth, our &s;ocial happine&s;s, our po|litical tranquillity, all depend on that controul of all our appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, which the ancients de&s;igned by the cardinal virtue of Temperance.</P>
<P>The only real que&s;tion to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, with regard to the higher cla&s;&s;es, is, how &s;tands the account of their &s;tock, as it con&s;i&s;ts in wealth of every de&s;cription? Have the burthens of the war compelled them to curtail any part of their former expenditure; which, I have before ob&s;erv|ed, affords the only &s;tandard of e&s;timating pro|perty
<PB N="118" REF="129">
as an object of taxation? Do they enjoy all the &s;ame conveniencies, the &s;ame comforts, the &s;ame elegancies, the &s;ame luxuries, in the &s;ame, or in as many different modes as they did before the war?</P>
<P>In the la&s;t eleven years, there have been no le&s;s than three &s;olemn enquiries into the finances of the kingdom, by three different Committees of your Hou&s;e. The fir&s;t was in the year 1786. On that occa&s;ion, I remember, the Report of the Committee was examined, and &s;ifted, and bolted to the bran, by a gentleman who&s;e keen and pow|erful talents I have ever admired. He thought there was not &s;ufficient evidence to warrant the plea&s;ing repre&s;entation, which the Committee had made, of our national pro&s;perity. He did not be|lieve, that our publick revenue could continue to be &s;o productive, as they had a&s;&s;umed. He even went the length of recording his own inferences of doubt, in a &s;et of re&s;olutions, which now &s;tand upon your Journals. And perhaps the retro&s;pect, on which the Report proceeded, did not go far enough back, to allow any &s;ure and &s;atisfactory average for a ground of &s;olid calculation. But what was the event? When the next Committee fate in 1791, they found, that, on an average of the la&s;t four years, their predece&s;&s;ors had fallen &s;hort in their e&s;timate of the permanent
<PB N="119" REF="130">
taxes by more than three hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds a year. Surely then if I can &s;how, that in the produce of tho&s;e &s;ame taxes, and more particularly of &s;uch as affect articles of luxurious u&s;e and con&s;umption, the four years of the war have equalled tho&s;e four years of peace, flouri&s;h|ing, as they were, beyond the mo&s;t &s;anguine &s;pecu|lations, I may expect to hear no more of the di&s;tre&s;s occa&s;ioned by the war.</P>
<P>The additional burdens which have been laid on &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;ame articles, might rea&s;onably claim &s;ome allowance to be made. Every new advance of the price to the con&s;umer, is a new incentive to him to retrench the quantity of his con&s;ump|tion; and if, upon the whole, he pays the &s;ame, his property computed by the &s;tandard of what he voluntarily pays, mu&s;t remain the &s;ame. But I am willing to forego that fair advantage in the enquiry. I am willing that the receipts of the permanent taxes which exi&s;ted before Ja|nuary 1793, &s;hould be compared during the war, and during the period of peace which I have men|tioned. I will go further. Complete accounts of the year 1791 were &s;eparately laid before your Hou&s;e. I am ready to &s;tand by a compari&s;on of the produce of four years up to the beginning of the year 1792, with that of the war. Of the year im|mediately previous to ho&s;tilities, I have not been
<PB N="120" REF="131">
able to obtain any perfect documents; but I have &s;een enough to &s;atisfy me, that although a compa|ri&s;on, including that year, might be le&s;s favour|able, yet it would not e&s;&s;entially injure my argu|ment.</P>
<P>You will always bear in mind, my dear Sir, that I am not con&s;idering whether, if the common enemy of the quiet of Europe had not forced us to take up arms in our own defence, the &s;pring-tide of our pro&s;perity might not have flowed higher than the mark, at which it now &s;tands. That con&s;ideration is connected with the que&s;tion of the ju&s;tice and the nece&s;&s;ity of the war. It is a que&s;tion which I have long &s;ince di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. I am now endeavour|ing to a&s;certain whether there exi&s;ts, in fact, any &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity as we hear every day a&s;&s;erted, to furni&s;h a mi&s;erable pretext for coun&s;elling us to &s;urrender, at di&s;cretion, our conque&s;ts, our honour, our dignity, our very independence, and, with it, all that is dear to man. It will be more than &s;uf|ficient for that purpo&s;e, if I can make it appear that we have been &s;tationary during the war. What then will be &s;aid, if, in reality, it &s;hall be proved that there is every indication of increa&s;ed and in|crea&s;ing wealth, not only poured into the grand re&s;ervoir of the national capital, but diffu&s;ed through all the channels of all the higher cla&s;&s;es, and giving life and activity, as it pa&s;&s;es, to the agri|culture,
<PB N="121" REF="132">
the manufactures, the commerce, and the navigation of the country?</P>
<P>The Finance Committee, which has been ap|pointed in this Se&s;&s;ion, has already made two re|ports. Every conclu&s;ion that I had before drawn, as you know, from my own ob&s;ervation, I have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing there confirmed by their authority. Large as was the &s;um, by which the Committee of 1791 found the e&s;timate of 1786 to have been exceeded in the actual pro|duce of four years of peace, their own e&s;timate has been exceeded, during the war, by a &s;um more than one-third larger. The &s;ame taxes have yielded more than half a million beyond their calculation. They yielded this, notwith&s;tanding the &s;toppage of the di&s;tilleries, again&s;t which, you may remember, that I privately remon&s;trated. With an allow|ance for that defalcation, they have yielded &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds annually above the actual ave|rage of the preceding four years of peace. I be|lieve this to have been without parallel in all for|mer wars. If regard be had to the great and un|avoidable burthens of the pre&s;ent war, I am con|fident of the fact.</P>
<P>But let us de&s;cend to particulars. The taxes, which go by the general name of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed taxes, comprehend the whole, or nearly the whole
<PB N="122" REF="133">
dome&s;tick e&s;tabli&s;hment of the rich. They include &s;ome things, which belong to the middling, and even to all, but the very lowe&s;t, cla&s;&s;es. They now con&s;i&s;t of the duties on hou&s;es and windows, on male &s;ervants, hor&s;es, and carriages. They did al&s;o extend to cottages, to female &s;ervants, waggons, and carts u&s;ed in hu&s;bandry, previous to the year 1792; when, with more enlightened policy, at the moment that the po&s;&s;ibility of war could not be out of the contemplation of any &s;tate&s;man, the wi&s;dom of Parliament confined them to their pre|&s;ent objects. I &s;hall give the gro&s;s a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment for five years, as I find it in the Appendix to the &s;e|cond Report of your Committee:</P>

The manufactory it&s;elf is a forced plant. We have been obliged to guard it from foreign competition by very &s;trict prohibitory laws.

<P>The diver&s;ions of the higher cla&s;&s;es form an|other, and the only remaining, head of enquiry into their expences.

And here, when I look to the Report of your Committee, I, for the fir&s;t time, perceive a failure.
<PB N="134" REF="145">
It is clearly &s;o. Whichever way I reckon the four years of peace, the old tax on the &s;ports of the field has certainly proved deficient &s;ince the war. The &s;ame money, however, or nearly the &s;ame, has been paid to Government; though the &s;ame num|ber of individuals have not contributed to the payment. An additional tax was laid in 1791, and, during the war, has produced upwards of 61,000l.; which is about 4000l. more than the decrea&s;e of the old tax, in one &s;cheme of compa|ri&s;on; and about 4000l. le&s;s, in the other &s;cheme. I might remark that the amount of the new tax, in the &s;everal years of the war, by no means bears the proportion, which it ought, to the old. There &s;eems to be &s;ome great irregularity, or other, in the receipt: but I do not think it worth while to exa|mine into the argument. I am willing to &s;up|po&s;e, that many, who, in the idlene&s;s of peace, made war upon partridges, hares, and phea&s;ants, may now carry more noble arms again&s;t the ene|mies of their country. Our political adver&s;aries may do, what they plea&s;e, with that conce&s;&s;ion. They are welcome to make the mo&s;t of it. I am &s;ure of a very hand&s;ome &s;et-off in the other branch of expence; the amu&s;ements of a town-life.</P>

Mo&s;t of them engage, for a &s;hort time at a va&s;t price, every actor or actre&s;s of name in the metropolis; a di&s;tinction, which, in the reign of my old friend Garrick, was confined to very few. The dre&s;&s;es, the &s;cenes, the decorations of every kind, I am told, are in a new &s;tyle of &s;plendour and magnifi|cence; whether to the advantage of our dramatick ta&s;te, upon the whole, I very much doubt. It is a &s;hew, and a &s;pectacle, not a play, that is exhibited. This is undoubtedly in the genuine manner of the Augu&s;tan age, but in a manner, which was cen&s;ur|ed by one of the be&s;t Poets and Criticks of that or any age:
<Q><L>&mdash;migravit ab aure voluptas</L>
<L>Omnis ad incertos oculos, &amp; gaudia vana;</L>
<L>Quatuor aut plures aulaea premuntur in horas,</L>
<L>Dum fugiunt equitum turmae, peditumque catervae;&mdash;</L></Q>
I mu&s;t interrupt the pa&s;&s;age, mo&s;t fervently to de|precate and abominate the &s;equel,
<Q>Mox trahitur manibus Regum fortuna retortis.</Q>
I hope, that no French fraternization, which the relations of peace and amity with &s;y&s;tematized Re|gicide,
<PB N="136" REF="147">
would a&s;&s;uredly, &s;ooner or later, draw after them, even if it &s;hould overturn our happy Con|&s;titution it&s;elf, could &s;o change the hearts of Eng|li&s;hmen, as to make them delight in repre&s;enta|tions and proce&s;&s;ions, which have no other merit than that of degrading and in&s;ulting the name of Royalty. But good ta&s;te, manners, morals, reli|gion, all fly, wherever the principles of Jacobini&s;m enter: and we have no &s;afety again&s;t them but in arms.</P>
<P>The Proprietors, whether in this they follow or lead what is called the town, to furni&s;h out the&s;e gaudy and pompous entertainments, mu&s;t col|lect &s;o much more from the Publick. It was but ju&s;t before the breaking out of ho&s;tilities, that they levied for them&s;elves the very tax, which, at the clo&s;e of the American war, they re|pre&s;ented to Lord North, as certain ruin to their affairs to demand for the State. The example has &s;ince been imitated by the Managers of our Italian Opera. Once during the war, if not twice (I would not willingly mi&s;tate any thing, but I am not very accurate on the&s;e &s;ubjects) they have rai&s;ed the price of their &s;ub&s;cription. Yet I have never heard, that any la&s;ting di&s;&s;atisfaction has been manife&s;ted, or that their hou&s;es have been unu&s;u|ally and con&s;tantly thin. On the contrary, all the three theatres have been repeatedly altered, and
<PB N="139" REF="148">
refitted, and enlarged, to make them capacious of the crowds, that nightly flock to them; and one of tho&s;e huge and lofty piles, which lifts its broad &s;houlders in gigantick pride, almo&s;t emulous of the temples of God, has been reared from the foun|dation at a charge of more than four&s;core thou&s;and pounds, and yet remains a naked, rough, un|&s;ightly heap.</P>
<P>I am afraid, my dear Sir, that I have tired you with the&s;e dull, though important details. But we are upon a &s;ubject, which, like &s;ome of a higher nature, refu&s;es ornament, and is contented with conveying in&s;truction. I know too, the ob&s;tinacy of unbelief, in tho&s;e perverted minds, which have no delight, but in contemplating the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;|tre&s;s, and predicting the immediate ruin, of their country. The&s;e birds of evil pre&s;age, at all times, have grated our ears with their melancholy &s;ong; and, by &s;ome &s;trange fatality or other, it has gene|rally happened, that they have poured forth their loude&s;t and deepe&s;t lamentations, at the periods of our mo&s;t abundant pro&s;perity. Very early in my publick life, I had occa&s;ion to make my&s;elf a little acquainted with their natural hi&s;tory. My fir&s;t po|litical tract in the collection, which a friend has made of my publications, is an an&s;wer to a very gloomy picture of the &s;tate of the nation, which was thought to have been drawn by a &s;tate&s;man of
<PB N="140" REF="149">
&s;ome eminence in his time. That was no more than the common &s;pleen of di&s;appointed ambition: in the pre&s;ent day, I fear, that too many are ac|tuated by a more malignant and dangerous &s;pirit. They hope, by depre&s;&s;ing our minds with a de&s;pair of our means and re&s;ources, to drive us, trembling and unre&s;i&s;ting, into the toils of our enemies, with whom, from the beginning of the Revolution in France, they have ever moved in &s;trict concert and co-operation. If with the report of your Finance Committee in their hands, they can &s;till affect to de&s;pond, and can &s;till &s;ucceed, as they do, in &s;preading the contagion of their pretended fears, among well-di&s;po&s;ed, though weak men; there is no way of counteracting them, but by fixing them down to particulars. Nor mu&s;t we forget, that they are unwearied agitators, bold a&s;&s;ertors, dex|trous &s;ophi&s;ters. Proof mu&s;t be accumulated upon proof, to &s;ilence them. With this view, I &s;hall now direct your attention to &s;ome other &s;triking and unerring indications of our flouri&s;hing condition; and they will in general, be derived from other &s;ources, but equally authentick; from other re|ports and proceedings of both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment, all which unite with wonderful force of con|&s;ent in the &s;ame general re&s;ult. Hitherto we have &s;een the &s;uperfluity of our capital di&s;covering it&s;elf only in procuring &s;uperfluous accommodation and enjoyment, in our hou&s;es, in our furniture, in our
<PB N="141" REF="150">
e&s;tabli&s;hments, in our eating and drinking, our clothing, and our publick diver&s;ions: we &s;hall now &s;ee it more beneficially employed in improving our territory it&s;elf: we &s;hall &s;ee part of our pre&s;ent opu|lence, with provident care, put out to u&s;ury for po&s;|terity.</P>
<P>To what ultimate extent, it may be wi&s;e or practicable, to pu&s;h inclo&s;ures of common and wa&s;te lands, may be a que&s;tion of doubt, in &s;ome points of view: but no per&s;on thinks them already carried to exce&s;s; and the relative magnitude of the &s;ums, laid out upon them, gives us a &s;tandard of e&s;timating the comparative &s;ituation of the landed intere&s;t. Your Hou&s;e, this Se&s;&s;ion, appointed a Committee on Wa&s;te Lands, and they have made a Report by their chairman, an Honourable Baro|ronet, for whom the Mini&s;ter the other day, (with very good intentions, I believe, but with little real profit to the publick) thought fit to erect a Board of Agriculture. The account, as it &s;tands there, ap|pears &s;ufficiently favourable. The greate&s;t num|ber of inclo&s;ing bills, pa&s;&s;ed in any one year of the la&s;t peace, does not equal the &s;malle&s;t annual number in the war; and tho&s;e of the la&s;t year ex|ceed, by more than one half, the highe&s;t year of peace. But what was my &s;urpri&s;e, on looking into the late report of the Secret Committee of the Lords, to find a li&s;t of the&s;e Bills during the war,

larger on the whole, by nearly one third! I have checked this account by the Statute-Book, and find it to be correct. What new brilliancy then does it throw over the pro&s;pect, bright as it was before! The number during the la&s;t four years, has more than doubled that of the four years immediately preceding; it has &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed the five years of peace, beyond which the Lords Committees have not gone; it has even &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed (I have verified the fact) the whole ten years of peace. I cannot &s;top here. I cannot advance a &s;ingle &s;tep in this enquiry, without being obliged to ca&s;t my eyes back to the period when I fir&s;t knew the country. The&s;e Bills, which had begun in the reign of Queen Anne, had pa&s;&s;ed every year in greater or le&s;s numbers from the year 1723; yet in all that &s;pace of time, they had not reached the amount of any two years during the pre&s;ent war; and though &s;oon after that time they rapidly in|crea&s;ed, &s;till at the acce&s;&s;ion of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty,
<PB N="143" REF="152">
they were very far &s;hort of the number pa&s;&s;ed in the four years of ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>In my fir&s;t Letter I mentioned the &s;tate of our inland navigation, neglected as it had been from the reign of King William to the time of my ob|&s;ervation. It was not till the pre&s;ent reign, that the Duke of Bridgwater's canal fir&s;t excited a &s;pirit of &s;peculation and adventure in this way. This &s;pi|rit &s;hewed it&s;elf, but nece&s;&s;arily made no great pro|gre&s;s, in the American war. When peace was re|&s;tored, it began of cour&s;e to work with more &s;en&s;i|ble effect; yet in ten years from that event, the Bills pa&s;&s;ed on that &s;ubject were not &s;o many as from the year 1793 to the pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament. From what I can trace on the Statute-Book, I am confident that all the capital expended in the&s;e pro|jects during the peace, bore no degree of propor|tion, (I doubt on very grave con&s;ideration whether all that was ever &s;o expended was equal) to the money which has been rai&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;es, &s;ince the war.

I know, that in the la&s;t four years of
<PB N="144" REF="153">
peace, when they ro&s;e regularly, and rapidly, the &s;ums &s;pecified in the acts were not near one-third of the &s;ub&s;equent amount. In the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, the Grand Junction Company, as it is called, having &s;unk half a million, (of which I feel the good effects at my own door) applied to your Hou&s;e, for permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ub&s;cribe half as much more, among them&s;elves. This Grand Junction is an ino&s;|culation of the Grand Trunk: and in the pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion, the latter Company has obtained the au|thority of Parliament, to float two hundred acres of land, for the purpo&s;e of forming a re&s;ervoir, thirty feet deep, two hundred yards wide at the head, and two miles in length; a lake which may almo&s;t vie with that which feeds, what once was, the now obliterated canal of Languedoc.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent war is, above all others, (of which we have heard or read) a war again&s;t landed property. That de&s;cription of property is in it's nature the firm ba&s;e of every &s;table government; and has been &s;o con|&s;idered, by all the wi&s;e&s;t writers of the old philo&s;ophy, from the time of the Stagyrite, who ob&s;erves that the agricultural cla&s;s of all others is the lea&s;t inclined to &s;edition. We find it to have been &s;o regarded, in the practical politicks of antiquity, where they are brought more directly home to our under&s;tand|ings and bo&s;oms, in the Hi&s;tory of Rome, and above all, in the writings of Cicero. The country tribes were always thought more re&s;pectable, than
<PB N="145" REF="154">
tho&s;e of the City. And if in our own Hi&s;tory, there is any one circum&s;tance to which, under God, are to be attributed the &s;teady re&s;i&s;tance, the fortu|nate i&s;&s;ue, and &s;ober &s;ettlement, of all our &s;truggles for liberty, it is, that while the landed intere&s;t, in&s;tead of forming a &s;eparate body, as in other countries, has, at all times, been in clo&s;e connexion and union with the other great intere&s;ts of the country, it has been &s;pontaneou&s;ly allowed to lead and direct, and moderate all the re&s;t. I cannot, therefore, but &s;ee with &s;ingular gratification, that during a war which has been eminently made for the de&s;truction of the landed proprietors, as well as of Prie&s;ts and Kings, as much has been done, by publick works, for the permanent benefit of their &s;take in this country, as in all the re&s;t of the current century, which now touches to it's clo&s;e. Perhaps, after this, it may not be nece&s;&s;ary to refer to private ob&s;ervation; but I am &s;atisfied, that in general, the rents of lands have been con&s;iderably increa&s;ed: they are increa&s;ed very con&s;iderably indeed, if I may draw any conclu&s;ion from my own little property of that kind. I am not ignorant, however, where our pub|lick burdens are mo&s;t galling. But all of this cla&s;s will con&s;ider, who they are, that are principally me|naced; how little the men of their de&s;cription in other countries, where this revolutionary fury has but touched, have been found equal to their own pro|tection; how tardy, and unprovided, and full of
<PB N="146" REF="155">
angui&s;h is their flight, chained down as they are by every tie to the &s;oil; how helple&s;s they are, above all other men, in exile, in poverty, in need, in all the varieties of wretchedne&s;s; and then let them well weigh, what are the burdens, to which they ought not to &s;ubmit for their own &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Many of the authorities, which I have already adduced, or to which I have referred, may convey a competent notion of &s;ome of our principal manu|factures. Their general &s;tate will be clear from that of our external and internal commerce, through which they circulate, and of which they are at once, the cau&s;e and effect. But the communication of the &s;everal parts of the kingdom with each other, and with foreign countries, has always been regard|ed as one of the mo&s;t certain te&s;ts to evince the pro&s;|perous or adver&s;e &s;tate of our trade in all it's branches. Recour&s;e has u&s;ually been had to the revenue of the Po&s;t Office with this view. I &s;hall include the product of the Tax which was laid in the la&s;t war, and which will make the evidence more conclu&s;ive, if it &s;hall afford the &s;ame inference:&mdash;I allude to the Po&s;t-Hor&s;e duty, which &s;hews the per|&s;onal intercour&s;e within the Kingdom, as the Po&s;t-Office &s;hews the intercour&s;e by letters, both within and without. The fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;tandards, then, ex|hibits an increa&s;e, according to my former &s;chemes of compari&s;on, from an eleventh to a twentieth part

<P><PB N="148" REF="157">What is the true inference to be drawn from the annual number of Bankruptcies, has been the occa|&s;ion of much di&s;pute.

We have already had very ample means of gathering, that the year 1796 was a very favourable year of trade, and in that year the number of Bankruptcies was at lea&s;t one-fifth below the u&s;ual average. I take this from <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a debate, 30th December, 1796, on the return of Lord Malme&s;bury.&mdash;See Woodfall's Parliamentary Debates, vol. xiii. page 591.</NOTE> the Declaration of the Lord ChanITEMor in the Hou&s;e of Lords. He profe&s;&s;ed to &s;peak from the records of Chancery; and he added another very &s;triking fact, that on the property actually paid into his Court (a very &s;mall part, indeed, of the whole property of the kingdom) there had accrued in that year a nett &s;urplus of eight hundred thou|&s;and pounds, which was &s;o much new capital.</P>

that lo&s;s to the revenue; and it is remarkable with regard to the latter, that in the year 1796, which was the lowe&s;t in the exci&s;e duties on wine it&s;elf, as well as in the quantity imported, more dealers in wine appear to have been licenced, than in any for|mer year, excepting the fir&s;t year of the war.

The Hawkers and Pedlars, I am a&s;|&s;ured, are &s;till doing well, though from &s;ome new arrangements re&s;pecting them made in 1789, it would be difficult to trace their proceedings in any &s;atisfactory manner.</P>
<P>When &s;uch is the vigour of our traffick in it's mi|nute&s;t ramifications, we may be per&s;uaded that the root and the trunk are &s;ound. When we &s;ee the life-blood of the State circulate &s;o freely through the capillary ve&s;&s;els of the &s;y&s;tem, we &s;carcely need enquire, if the heart performs its functions aright. But let us approach it; let us lay it bare, and watch the &s;y&s;tole and dia&s;tole, as it now re|ceives, and now pours forth the vital &s;tream through all the members. The port of London
<PB N="154" REF="163">
has always &s;upplied the main evidence of the &s;tate of our commerce. I know, that amid&s;t all the difficulties and embarra&s;&s;ments of the year 1793, from cau&s;es unconnected with, and prior to the war, the tonnage of &s;hips in the Thames actually ro&s;e. But I &s;hall not go through a detail of offi|cial papers on this point. There is evidence which has appeared this very &s;e&s;&s;ion before your Hou&s;e, infinitely more forcible and impre&s;&s;ive to my apprehen&s;ion, than all the journals and ledgers of all the In&s;pectors General from the days of Davenant. It is &s;uch as cannot carry with it any &s;ort of fallacy. It comes, not from one &s;et, but from many oppo&s;ite &s;ets of witne&s;&s;es, who all agree in nothing el&s;e; witne&s;&s;es of the grave&s;t and mo&s;t unexceptionable character, and who confirm what they &s;ay, in the &s;ure&s;t manner, by their con|duct. Two different bills have been brought in for improving the port of London. I have it from very good intelligence, that when the project was fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted from nece&s;&s;ity, there were no le&s;s than eight different plans, &s;upported by eight dif|ferent bodies of &s;ub&s;cribers. The co&s;t of the lea&s;t was e&s;timated at two hundred thou&s;and pounds, and of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, at twelve hundred thou&s;and. The two, between which the conte&s;t now lies, &s;ub|&s;tantially agree (as all the others mu&s;t have done) in the motives and rea&s;ons of the preamble: but I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to that bill which is propo&s;ed
<PB N="155" REF="164">
on the part of the Mayor, Aldermen, and common Council, becau&s;e I regard them as the be&s;t au|thority, and their language in it&s;elf is fuller and more preci&s;e. I certainly &s;ee them complain of the "great delays, accidents, damages, lo&s;&s;es, and extraordinary expences, which are almo&s;t continu|ally &s;u&s;tained, to the hindrance and di&s;courage|ment of commerce, and the great injury of the publick avenues." But what are the cau&s;es to which they attribute their complaints? The fir&s;t is, <Q>THAT FROM THE VERY GREAT AND PRO|GRESSIVE INCREASE OF THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SHIPS AND OTHER VESSELS, TRADING TO THE PORT OF LONDON; the River Thames is, in general, &s;o much crouded that the navigation of a con&s;iderable part of the river is rendered tedious and dangerous; and there is much want of room for the &s;afe and convenient mooring of ve&s;&s;els, and con&s;tant acce&s;s to them.</Q> The &s;econd is of the &s;ame nature. It is the want of regulations and arrangements, never be|fore found nece&s;&s;ary, for expedition and facility. The third is of another kind, but to the &s;ame ef|fect: <Q>that the legal quays are too confined, and there is not &s;ufficient accommodation for the landing and &s;hipping of cargoes.</Q> And the fourth and la&s;t is &s;till different; they de&s;cribe <Q>the ave|nues to the legal quays,</Q> (which little more than a century &s;ince, the great fire of London opened
<PB N="156" REF="165">
and dilated beyond the mea&s;ure of our then cir|cum&s;tances) to be now <Q>much too narrow, and incommodious, for the great concour&s;e of carts and other carriages u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing there.</Q> Thus, our trade has grown too big for the ancient limits of art and nature. Our &s;treets, our lanes, our &s;hores, the river it&s;elf, which has &s;o long been our pride, are impeded, and ob&s;tructed, and choaked up by our riches. They are like our &s;hops, "bur&s;ting with opulence." To the&s;e mis|fortunes, to the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es and grievances alone, we are told it is to be imputed, that &s;till more of our capital has not been pu&s;hed into the chan|nel of our commerce, to roll back in it's reflux &s;till more abundant capital, and fructify the national trea&s;ury in it's cour&s;e. Indeed, my dear Sir, when I have before my eyes this con&s;entient te&s;timony of the Corporation of the City of London, the We&s;t-India Merchants, and all the other Merchants who promoted the other plans, &s;truggling and contend|ing, which of them &s;hall be permitted to lay out their money in con&s;onance with their te&s;timony; I cannot turn a&s;ide to examine what one or two vio|lent petitions, tumultuou&s;ly voted by real or pre|tended Liverymen of London, may have &s;aid of the utter de&s;truction and annihilation of trade.</P>
<P>This opens a &s;ubject, on which every true lover of his country, and at this cri&s;is, every friend to
<PB N="157" REF="166">
the liberties of Europe, and of &s;ocial order in every country, mu&s;t dwell and expatiate with delight. I mean to wind up all my proofs of our a&s;toni&s;hing and almo&s;t incredible pro&s;perity, with the valuable information given to the Se|cret Committee of the Lords by the In&s;pector-General. And here I am happy that I can ad|mini&s;ter an antidote to all de&s;pondence, from the &s;ame di&s;pen&s;ary from which the fir&s;t do&s;e of poi&s;on was &s;uppo&s;ed to have come. The Report of that Committee is generally believed to have been drawn up, (and it is certainly done with great ability) by the fame noble Lord, who was &s;aid, as the au|thor of the pamphlet of 1795, to have led the way in teaching us to place all our hope on that very ex|periment, which he afterwards declared in his place to have been from the beginning utterly without hope. We have now his authority to &s;ay, that as far as our re&s;ources were concerned, the ex|periment was equally without nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P><Q>It appears, as he has very ju&s;tly and &s;atisfacto|rily ob&s;erved, by the accounts of the value of the imports and exports for the la&s;t twenty years, produced by Mr. Irving, that the demand for ca&s;h to be &s;ent abroad</Q> (which by the way, includ|ing the loan to the Emperor, was nearly one third le&s;s &s;ent to the Continent of Europe, than in the &s;even years war) <Q>was greatly compen|&s;ated
<PB N="158" REF="167">
by a very large balance of commerce in favour of this kingdom; greater than was ever known in any preceding period. The value of the exports of the la&s;t year amounted, according to the valuation on which the accounts of the In|&s;pector General are founded, to &pound;.30,424,184; which is more than double what it was in any year of the American war, and one third more than it was on an average during the la&s;t peace, previous to the year 1792; and though the value of the imports to this country has, during the &s;ame peace, greatly increa&s;ed, the exce&s;s of the value of the exports above that of the imports, which con&s;titutes the balance of trade, has aug|mented even in a greater proportion.</Q> The&s;e ob&s;ervations might perhaps be branched out into other points of view, but I &s;hall leave them to your own active and ingenious mind. There is another, and &s;till more important light in which the In&s;pector General's information may be &s;een; and that is, as affording a compari&s;on of &s;ome circum&s;tances in this war, with the commercial hi&s;tory of all our other wars in the pre&s;ent century.</P>
<P>In all former ho&s;tilities, our exports gradually declined in value, and then (with one &s;ingle excep|tion) a&s;cended again, till they reached and pa&s;&s;ed the level of the preceding peace. But this was a work of time, &s;ometimes more, &s;ometimes le&s;s &s;low.

In Queen Anne's war, which began in 1702, it was an interval of ten years, before this was effected. Nine years only were nece&s;&s;ary in the war of 1739, for the &s;ame operation. The &s;even years war &s;aw the period much &s;hortened: ho&s;tilities began in 1755, and in 1758, the fourth year of the war, the ex|ports mounted above the peace-mark. There was, however, a di&s;tingui&s;hing feature of that war, that our tonnage, to the very la&s;t moment, was in a &s;tate of great depre&s;&s;ion, while our commerce was chiefly carried on by foreign ve&s;&s;els. The American war was darkened with &s;ingular and peculiar adver&s;ity. Our exports never came near to their peaceful ele|vation, and our tonnage continued with very little fluctuation, to &s;ub&s;ide lower and lower <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account is extracted from different parts of Mr. Chal|mer's E&s;timate. It is but ju&s;t to mention, that in Mr. Chalmers E&s;timate, the &s;ums are uniformly lower, than those of the &s;ame year in Mr. Irving's account.</NOTE>. On the other hand, the pre&s;ent war, with regard to our com|merce, has the white mark of as &s;ingular felicity. If from internal cau&s;es, as well as the con&s;equence of ho&s;tilities, the tide ebbed in 1793, it ru&s;hed back again with a bore in the following year; and from that time has continued to &s;well, and run, every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive year, higher and higher into all our ports. The value of our exports la&s;t year above the year 1792 (the mere increa&s;e of our commerce during the war) is equal to the average value of
<PB N="160" REF="169">
all the exports during the wars of William and Anne.</P>
<P>It has been already pointed out, that our imports have not kept pace with our exports; of cour&s;e, on the face of the account, the balance of trade, both po&s;itively and comparatively con&s;idered, mu&s;t have been much more than ever in our favour. In that early little tract of my mine, to which I have already more than once referred, I made many ob|&s;ervations on the u&s;ual method of computing that balance, as well as the u&s;ual objection to it, that the entries at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e were not always true. As you probably remember them, I &s;hall not repeat them here. On the one hand, I am not &s;urpri&s;ed that the &s;ame trite objection is perpetually renewed by the detractors of our national affluence; and on the other hand I am gratified in perceiving, that the balance of trade &s;eems to be now computed in a manner much clearer, than it u&s;ed to be, from tho&s;e errors which I formerly noticed. The In&s;pector-General appears to have made his e&s;timate with every po&s;&s;ible guard and caution. His opinion is entitled to the greate&s;t re&s;pect. It was in &s;ub|&s;tance (I &s;hall again u&s;e the words of the noble Re|porter, as much better than my own) <Q>That the true balance of our trade amounted, on a me|dium of the four years preceding January 1796, to upwards of &pound;.6,50<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">,000, per annum, exclu|&s;ive

of the profits ari&s;ing from our Ea&s;t and We&s;t India trade, which he e&s;timates at upwards of &pound;.4,000,000 per annum; exclu&s;ive of the profits derived from our fi&s;heries.</Q> So that in|cluding the fi&s;heries, and making a moderate allow|ance for the exceedings, which Mr. Irving him&s;elf &s;uppo&s;es, beyond his calculation; without reckon|ing, what the publick creditors them&s;elves pay to them&s;elves, and without taking one &s;hilling from the &s;tock of the landed intere&s;t; our colonies, our oriental po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, our &s;kill and indu&s;try, our commerce, and navigation, at the commencement of this year, were pouring a new annual capital into the kingdom; hardly half a million &s;hort of the whole intere&s;t of that tremendous debt, from which we are taught to &s;hrink in di&s;may, as from an overwhelming and intolerable oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If then the real &s;tate of this nation is &s;uch as I have de&s;cribed, and I am only apprehen&s;ive, that you may think, I have taken too much pains to exclude all doubt on this que&s;tion; if no cla&s;s is le&s;&s;ened in it's numbers, or in it's &s;tock, or in it's conveniencies, or even it's luxuries; if they build as many habitations, and as elegant and as commo|dious as ever, and furni&s;h them with every charge|able decoration, and every prodigality of ingenious invention, that can be thought of by tho&s;e who even encumber their nece&s;&s;ities with &s;uperfluous ac|commodation;

if they are as numerou&s;ly attended; if their equipages are as &s;plendid; if they regale at table with as much or more variety of plenty than ever; if they are clad in as expen&s;ive and changeful a diver&s;ity according to their ta&s;tes and modes; if they are not deterred from the plea&s;ures of the field by the charges, which Government has wi&s;ely turned from the culture to the &s;ports of the field; if the theatres are as rich and as well filled and greater, and at a higher price than ever; (and, what is more important than all) if it is plain from the trea&s;ures which are &s;pread over the &s;oil, or confided to the winds and the &s;eas, that there are as many who are indulgent to their propen&s;ities of par&s;imony, as others to their volup|tuous de&s;ires, and that the pecuniary capital grows in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing; on what ground are we au|thorized to &s;ay, that a nation, gamboling in an ocean of &s;uperfluity is undone by want? With what face can we pretend, that they who have not denied any one gratification to any one appetite, have a right to plead poverty in order to fami&s;h their vir|tues, and to put their duties on &s;hort allowance? That they are to take the law from an imperious enemy, and can contribute no longer to the honour of their king, to the &s;upport of the independence of their country, to the &s;alvation of that Europe, which, if it falls, much cru&s;h them with its gigantick ruins? How can they affect to &s;weat, and &s;tagger, and groan

under their burthens, to whom the mines of New|foundland, richer than tho&s;e of Mexico and Peru, are now thrown in as a make-weight in the &s;cale of their exorbitant opulence? How can they faint, and creep, and cringe, and pro&s;trate them&s;elves at the foot&s;tool of ambition and crime, who, during a &s;hort though violent &s;truggle, which they have ne|ver &s;upported with the energy of men, have ama&s;&s;ed more to their annual accumulation, than all the well-hu&s;banded capital, that enabled their ance&s;|tors by long, and doubtful, and ob&s;tinate conflicts, to protect, and liberate, and vindicate the civilized world. But I do not accu&s;e the people of Eng|land. As to the great majority of them, they have done whatever in their &s;everal ranks, and condi|tions, and de&s;criptions, was required of them by their relative &s;ituations in &s;ociety; and from tho&s;e the great ma&s;s of mankind cannot depart, without the &s;ubver&s;ion of all publick order. They look up to that Government, which they obey that they may be protected. They a&s;k to be led and directed by tho&s;e rulers, whom Providence and the laws of their country have &s;et over them, to the attainment of their own &s;afety, and welfare, and honour. They have again delegated the greate&s;t tru&s;t, which they have to be&s;tow, to tho&s;e faithful repre&s;entatives who made their true voice heard again&s;t the di&s;turbers and de&s;troyers of Europe. They &s;uffered, with unap|proving acquie&s;cence, &s;olicitations to an unju&s;t and

u&s;urping Power, whom they did not provoke, and who&s;e ho&s;tile menaces they did not dread. When the exigencies of the publick &s;ervice could only be met by their voluntary zeal, they &s;tarted forth with an ardour, which out&s;tripped the de&s;ires of tho&s;e, who had injured them by doubting, whether it might not be nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to compul&s;ion. They have, in all things, repo&s;ed an enduring, but not an unreflecting confidence. That confidence demands a full return. It fixes a re&s;pon&s;ibility on the Mini&s;ters entire and undivided. The people &s;tand acquitted, if the war is not carried on in a manner &s;uited to it's objects. If the pub|lick &s;afety &s;uffers any detriment, they are to an&s;wer it, and they alone. It's armies, it's navies, are given to them without &s;tint or re&s;triction. It's trea|&s;ures are poured out at their feet. It's con&s;tancy is ready to &s;econd all their efforts. They are not to fear a re&s;pon&s;ibility for acts of manly adventure. The re&s;pon&s;ibility which they are to dread, is, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;hew them&s;elves unequal to the expec|tation of a brave people. The more doubtful may be the con&s;titutional and oeconomical que&s;tions, upon which they have received &s;o marked a &s;up|port, the more loudly they are called upon to &s;up|port this great war, for the &s;ucce&s;s of which their country is willing to &s;uper&s;ede con&s;iderations of no &s;light importance. Where I &s;peak of re&s;pon&s;ibility, I do not mean to exclude that &s;pecies of it, which

the legal powers of the country have a right finally to exact from tho&s;e who abu&s;e a publick tru&s;t; but high as this is, there is a re&s;pon&s;ibility which at|taches on them, from which the whole legitimate power of the kingdom cannot ab&s;olve them; there is a re&s;pon&s;ibility to con&s;cience and to glory; a re|&s;pon&s;ibility to the exi&s;ting world, and to that po&s;|terity, which men of their eminence cannot avoid for glory or for &s;hame; a re&s;pon&s;ibility to a tribu|nal, at which, not only Mini&s;ters, but Kings and Parliaments, but even Nations them&s;elves, mu&s;t one day an&s;wer.</P>
