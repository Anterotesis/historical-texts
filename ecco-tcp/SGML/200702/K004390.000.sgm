<HEAD>An Enquiry into the Di&s;po&s;al of the Equivalent.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been the Subject of Debate for &s;ometime, now whether we &s;hould have an Equivalent in <HI>Scotland</HI> for &s;uch Pay|ments as are to be made on a Coalition of the Nations? &mdash; but whether what was Propo&s;ed, was Equal, was really an Equivalent or no? And the World has been long hurried with the&s;e Enquities.</P>
<P>But now here ari&s;es a new Cloud, and tho' 'tis not only no bigger than a Mans Hand, but is never like to be bigger; yet as it is dre&s;t up, it threatens mighty things: and this is, what you &s;hall do with the Equivalent when you have it.</P>
<P>'Tis a little hard, People that cry up your National Sagaci|ty, in their Arguments again&s;t an Equivalent in general, &s;hould que&s;tion your Sagacity in knowing what to do with the Mo|ney when you have it.</P>
<P>To An&s;wer therefore the Doubts of &s;ome, and prevent the Objections of others, I &s;hall enter a little briefly on an En|quiry into the manner of di&s;po&s;ing the Equivalent you are to have; or, in &s;hort, Enquire how you &s;hall employ the Money when it comes.</P>
<P>And in general, as to this Head, I think the nature of the Payment it &s;elf, and the very words of the Treaty direct Us to the u&s;e to which this Money is to be employ'd, viz. <HI>An Equi|valent.</HI></P>
<P>The Property here will have no alteration in its Denomina|tion, it remains an Equivalent to its la&s;t Circulation in|to the Chaos of the current Ca&s;h of <HI>Britain;</HI> you receive it as an
<PB N="2" REF="4">
Equivalent, and you pay it as an Equivalent, 'tis an Equivalent pay'd you for Money, which by your Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;es will of cour&s;e be appropriated to the u&s;es of another Nation after the Union, which Nation therefore advances you the Sum <HI>in &s;pecie,</HI> that you may not be out of Pur&s;e on their Account.</P>
<P>When you have it, you di&s;po&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. As an Equivalent to the <HI>African-Company</HI> for the demi&s;e and di&s;&s;olution of their Society, there being Companies in <HI>England</HI> already embark'd in tho&s;e Trades, and double Com|panies having prov'd incompatible, as in the two <HI>East-India-Companies,</HI> who if they had remain'd ununited to this time, had been both ruin'd: And the Members of this Company ha|ving by the Union full leave to come in to the &s;aid <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Company, as freely, and on the &s;ame Conditions as <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> may, It is agreed the <HI>Scots</HI> Company &s;hall cea&s;e, and for a Satisfaction, the fir&s;t part of the Equivalent is appropriated to be an Equivalent for the &s;aid Company, by paying the Sub&s;cri|bers their Principal and Intere&s;t, and &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ompany expiring, &s;ets them down ju&s;t where it took them up, and I think they ought to e&s;teem it a very happy Landing, and what without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>England</HI> they could not have obtain'd by Trade in 20 Years.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Head for the di&s;po&s;ing this Money, is as an E|quivalent for the Coin, which by the Treaty is to be reduced to the Standard of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay very little to a Gentlemans Paper, who is for having this Equivalent made good before that to the <HI>African Company,</HI> as a thing of va&s;t Moment to the Nation.</P>
<P>If I under&s;tand the Di&s;pute, <HI>one previous Que&s;tion well di&s;|cu&s;s'd,</HI> will effectually An&s;wer all his Objections; and that is, Whether there is not enough in the Equivalent, that <HI>Englond</HI> is to Pay, to Di&s;charge both, and if that be true, the mighty Di&s;pute drops of cour&s;e, and it is not one Farthing matter which of the&s;e two go fir&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
I cannot but think the Gentleman that wrote that Sheet, went on a Calcul of the Coin as fal&s;e, as he has done of the Equivalent it &s;elf, where he mi&s;takes Ninety Thou&s;and Pound atone Clap, and no wonder he is in &s;uch concern, &s;ince he has lo&s;t &s;uch a Sum out of the whole, ju&s;t at his fir&s;t &s;etting out, for he &s;ays, 'tis 309885 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>s.</HI> and the &s;everal Times, where|as if I think right, 'tis ju&s;t 398085 <HI>l.</HI> 10 <HI>&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore attempt here two things, 1. Examine what the <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of Coin are that are to be reduced. And 2ly To make a probable conjecture at the Deficiency.</P>
<P>For the <HI>&s;pecies, I</HI> &s;hall ob&s;erve the words of the Treaty &s;ay, not the current Money in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but the <HI>current Coin of</HI> Scotland, and this di&s;tinction will immediatly lead me to this Negative.</P>
<P>That you are not to imagine, as &s;ome have very gro&s;ly done, that the Forreign Coins, which the Error of Cu&s;tom, the Di&s;|a&s;ter of Trade, and the Searcity of Bullion, have made cur|rent here at an extravagant rate, &s;hould be brought into your Mint and be recoin'd; and the Owner of &s;uch Money be allow'd the difference from the Rate of their pre&s;ent Valuation to the Price of that new Standard&mdash;, let no Men flatter them&s;elves with &s;uch a Notion, if this were true, it would not only expo&s;e <HI>Scotland</HI> to innumerable Incoveniencies, but might in|deed &s;oon eat up the whole Equivalent; &s;ince as there mu&s;t be a certain &s;tated time given for bringing in the Money into the Mint, all the Rix Dollars in <HI>Europe</HI> might be brought into <HI>Scotland,</HI> the difference between their real and imaginary Va|lue, be paid in <HI>&s;pecie</HI> by the Publick, and the Owner receive the new Money for the Remainder, which difference would make it very well worth while, to bring the Dollars from Abroad, and carry back the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crowns in their Room, or may lay out the Money in any part of <HI>Britain</HI> in Manufactures, Corn or Lead, and carry them cheaper to Market than any Na|tive of <HI>Britain</HI> can do it, his Money co&s;ting him le&s;s than theirs does.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
This was exactly the Ca&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> when Guineas ro&s;e from 21 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> each to 30. The Merchants in <HI>Holland</HI> &amp; <HI>Ham|burgh</HI> immediatly fall to buying of Gold, and &s;end it to <HI>Eng|land</HI> by all po&s;&s;ible Conveyance, &s;o much as by the very Po&s;t, and &s;uch was the hurry, that had it held much longer, all the Gold in <HI>Europe</HI> would have flow'd into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Con&s;equence of this was, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants were &s;truck out of their own Trade. A <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant could buy Bayes at <HI>Colchester,</HI> or Sarges at <HI>Exeter,</HI> and &s;end them to <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;ell 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants that liv'd at the &s;ame Town: The Ca&s;e was plain, the Gold which in <HI>Holland</HI> &s;tood them in 4 <HI>l.</HI> to 4 <HI>l.</HI> 7 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> and tho' at la&s;t it ri&s;e up to 5 <HI>l. per</HI> Ounce, yet in <HI>England</HI> went for a|bove 6 Pound, and &s;o their Money co&s;t them 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> le&s;s than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant could buy for.</P>
<P>From this Example I think 'tis evident, that the Forreign Coin has no concern in this Reduction.</P>
<P>If it had been an&s;wered, that this then will be an immediate Lo&s;s to the Nation, and to private Per&s;ons al&s;o: I An&s;wer,</P>
<P>To the Nation it can be no Lo&s;s, becau&s;e, when ever &s;uch Pieces came into <HI>Scotland,</HI> the imaginary Value was an Addi|tion to its real Value; and &s;o rai&s;ed its Currency to the Credit of the general Stock: And when ever it goes away again, the Difference is only an imaginary Diminution, and &s;tands to the Debit of the publick Stock in the &s;ame manner; and the gene|ral Value of <HI>Scotland</HI> receives no real Alteration.</P>
<P>Money is a real intrin&s;ick Species appointed by Cu&s;tom, as the Medium of Trade to bring Commerce in all its particular States to a Ballance&mdash;So much as its real Value amounts to, &s;o much real Wealth is in that Nation, and this real Value is every where the &s;ame; But its <HI>Received Value</HI> differs in the &s;everal Nations, according to the particular Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e Nations, as to Coin, Standards, Plenty or Scarcity of Money.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">
The&s;e Differences are again reconcil'd among Merchants, and all is brought to PAR in their Negotiating, by adding or dimini&s;hing, as the imaginary Differences in Value require between Nation and Nation, or Port and Port, and this is called Exchange, a thing full of Nicety, and which I take to be the be&s;t Accompli&s;hment of a compleat Merchant.</P>
<P>'Tis true the Rates of Exchange differ, ri&s;e and fall, accor|ding to the Quantities of Money that lye to Draw or to Re|mitt: But this is a thing that depends &s;o much on the Artifice of the Merchant or Exchanger, that it has little regard to the real Differences of the Species; and therefore it is not to my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. The next Negative relates to the Coin of <HI>England,</HI> which is now current here, &s;uch as Guineas of Gold and Silver Pieces, of the Crown, Half Crown, Shilling and Sixpence; The&s;e I pre&s;ume &s;hall find no Alteration here, and being the &s;ame to which the Coin of <HI>Brittain</HI> is to be reduced, there can be no melting them down, for that would be to do nothing at all, but melt the Half Crown into Half a Crown, and a Shilling into a Shilling, and &s;o on.</P>
<P>As to the Lo&s;s upon this Money, it is impo&s;&s;ible to have it Rectified by any Law, or any ju&s;t Equivalent given for it; Since, &s;hould any time be given for that, it would make a wild Trade to fetch a Million or two of it from <HI>England,</HI> carry it into the Mint, demand 1 <HI>d. per</HI> Shilling, and immediately carry back the very &s;ame Species again.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I &s;hould have thought the&s;e Negatives of no U&s;e, had I not &s;een abundance of People weak enough to ima|gine they &s;hould receive Satisfaction here from the Publick for all the Deficiency of the imaginary Value of Forreign Money.</P>
<P>I could &s;pend &s;ome time to &s;hew Examples, but I think it needle&s;s; <HI>England</HI> made three E&s;&s;ays about Money, and the&s;e are Examples enough; in two of them they made no Equiva|lent for Lo&s;s, and in the third they did, and they exactly hit the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> They reform'd the Guineas, and gave no Equivalent for the Lo&s;s; they &s;unk them from 30 to 22 <HI>&s;hil.</HI> each at one Blow, and &s;ome rich Engro&s;&s;ers of tho&s;e plea&s;ant Manufactories lo&s;t great Sums of Money by it.&mdash;The Rea&s;on was plain, it was a Di&s;temper in Trade, and wanted a Cure, every Man had a Share in the Benefit at fir&s;t, and every Body ought to bear their Share of the Burden, and take their Chance for their Particulars.</P>
<P>Another time, the Parliament finding Trade oppre&s;t by a Flux of <HI>French</HI> Pi&s;toles, reduc'd them to 17 <HI>&s;hil.</HI> each, and for this there was no Equivalent offered, for the Evil was of the &s;ame Original.</P>
<P>And here by the way I mu&s;t Note, That it was not a Mi&s;|chief to <HI>England</HI> to have a Flux of Gold, either Guineas or Pi&s;toles; Nor can it be to <HI>Scotland,</HI> if SHE had ten Millions of Dollars among her current Money; But the Evil is, the&s;e &s;everal Coins going There or HERE at an Advance in Price, by which Your Neighbours always have this Advantage, That They draw Your Goods a|way at the Price of all that imaginary Value.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> fell to work with their own Coin, Reduc'd it all to the Standard, and Recoin'd it; And then they allow'd an Equivalent to the Proprietor&mdash;Becau&s;e now they did not Reduce advanc'd Value, but took in the very Species; At which time Clipping, Counterfeiting, and &s;uch like Abu&s;es had made it really Deficient in the Spe|cies: This the Government was obliged to, and &s;o in <HI>Scotland</HI> it will be of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Now, the Gentleman that Quarrels at this, argues, this is a mighty Concern, and is angry 'tis put off to the la&s;t, or Ex|cre&s;cence, as he calls it of the Equivalent, &s;ince 'twill <HI>&V;n|doubtedly be an &V;nknown and In&s;upportable Lo&s;s and Hazard to the Nation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9">
Now, not to &s;pend time to be merry upon the blunder of the Lo&s;s, being in&s;upportable fir&s;t, and then unknown; I would be glad this in&s;upportable Burden might be examined, and I'll go the neare&s;t way to it that I can.</P>
<P>It is plain none but the Coin is to be reduced, and when all the pre&s;ent Coin is call'd in, I believe no Man will &s;ay it is likely it &s;hould amount to 100000 <HI>lib. Sterling</HI> in Silver.</P>
<P>Of this a great part is in the new Coin, 5 <HI>d.</HI> 10 <HI>d.</HI> 20 <HI>d.</HI> 40 <HI>d.</HI> Pieces, and of the&s;e there can be no Lo&s;s, if the Gentle|men who have carried &s;o great a Quantity Abroad lately in <HI>&s;pecie</HI> &s;hould be plea&s;ed to carry away a few more, there would be &s;o few left as would effectually take off the Lo&s;s on that Head.</P>
<P>As to the old 14 <HI>&s;h.</HI> Pieces, and 7 <HI>d.</HI> and 3 <HI>d.</HI> and 3 <HI>d.</HI> Half Penny, the Quantity is very &s;mall, and all the re&s;t is Copper-Money, the deficiency of which cannot be much. And upon the whole, if this Gentleman will plea&s;e to procure a Tack or Farm upon this Ca&s;uality, I &s;hall at any time bring him People, that giving unque&s;tionable Security to the Go|vernment, &s;hall undertake all the Lo&s;s and Deficiency, and make it good to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Coinage excepted, on the whole Coin of <HI>Scotland</HI> for 30000 <HI>lib. Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>If this be &s;o then, the mighty weight of in&s;upportable Lo&s;s is at an end.</P>
<P>I know it is enquir'd here, Whether on reducing the Coin to the Standard, the Prices of Goods, Labour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hall not fall in all places, and &s;o <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;uffer a Lo&s;s here, which may be indeed in&s;upportable, and tho' I know a long An&s;wer is expected to this, mine will be very &s;hort.</P>
<P>I An&s;wer, This is no Lo&s;s at all, for this only Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>There is a &s;inking the imaginary Value indeed, but no &s;ink|ing the real Value.</P>
<P>The <HI>Species</HI> is not deba&s;ed, nor your Standard allayed, and therefore tho' your Goods, Manufactories and Labour &s;eem to &s;ink, they really do not &s;ink.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10" MS="y">
'Tis true you &s;hall buy as much for 12 <HI>d.</HI> then as you do for 13 <HI>d.</HI> now, but that you buy for 12 <HI>d.</HI> now, &s;hall &s;ell for as much Abroad as that you bought for 13 <HI>d.</HI> before, and you &s;hall remit Home at the &s;ame Price too.</P>
<P>The Poor Man &s;hall Labour as much now for 12 <HI>d.</HI> as he did before for 13 <HI>d.</HI> but then his 12 <HI>d.</HI> &s;hall now buy as much Provi&s;ion for his Family as his 13 <HI>d.</HI> would do be|fore.</P>
<P>The Landlord &s;hall receive but 12 <HI>d.</HI> for his Farm, that be|fore pay'd him 13, but he &s;hall buy as many Hor&s;es or Hou&s;es, Lands or Goods for his 12 <HI>d.</HI> as he could before for his 13 <HI>d.</HI> &s;o that every way the Intrin&s;ick remains the &s;ame, and the Na|tion has no Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>In Forreign Exchanges it is the &s;ame, your Value is all over the World the &s;ame, from <HI>England</HI> you &s;hall draw without Gain, but then you remit without Lo&s;s, and which way &s;oever you turn as to Ballance of Exchange, 'tis the &s;ame thing, becau&s;e the intrin&s;ick Value of the <HI>&s;pecies</HI> remains the &s;ame.</P>
<P>All the imaginary Inconveniencies about the Coin, with re|&s;pect to the time of Coinage, may as effectually be An&s;wered as this: And the Practice in <HI>England</HI> is a Precedent to go by, if the Currency of the Mint be &s;upported by a &s;mall Sum of new Money before Hand, there can be no inconvenience of time or &s;top of <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> &amp; therefore the &s;ad Complaint the Author of that Sheet makes of Forreign Bills being Prote&s;ted, or Landlords ruin|ing the poor Tennent for want of <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of current Money, is at an end.</P>
<P>Indeed if the old Money was to be call'd in before the new Money was to be given out, there might be &s;ome &s;top, and for want of Money Trade might &s;uffer &s;ome Inconvenience, Bills be Prote&s;ted, and the like.</P>
<P>But 'tis but keeping the old Money current till the gro&s;s of the new Money be delivered out, it will circulate in&s;en&s;ibly, and not the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible he&s;itation be felt.</P>
