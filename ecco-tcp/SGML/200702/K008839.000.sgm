<HEAD>LETTER FROM The Rt. Hon. EDMUND BURKE TO The TRANSLATOR of his <HI>Reflec|tions on the Revolution in France.</HI></HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY I had the honour of receiving your Letter, in which you de&s;ire that I may revi&s;e and &s;often the ex|pre&s;&s;ions which I have made u&s;e of con|cerning Henry IV. King of France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pa&s;&s;age objected to by Mr. Burke's Tran&s;lator is the following:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Henry of Navarre was a politic and ac|tive prince. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed indeed great humanity and mildne&s;s; but an humanity and mildne&s;s that never &s;tood in the way of his intere&s;ts. He never &s;ought to be loved, without putting him&s;elf in a condition fir&s;t to be feared. He u&s;ed &s;oft language with determined conduct. He a&s;|&s;erted and maintained his humanity in the gro&s;s, and di&s;|tributed his aids of conce&s;&s;ion only in the detail. He &s;pent the income of his prerogatives nobly, but he took care not to break in upon the capital; <HI>never abandoning for a moment any of the claims which be made under the fundamental laws, nor &s;paring to &s;hed the blood of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed him, often in the field, &s;ometimes upon the &s;caffold.</HI>"</Q> Page 201.</NOTE> I am
<PB N="8" REF="5">
not at all &s;urpri&s;ed at your reque&s;t; for &s;ince your childhood, you have heard every one talk of the plea&s;ing manner and mild tem|per of that Prince. Tho&s;e qualities have &s;haded, and almo&s;t obliterated, that vigi|lance and vigour, without which he would never have either merited or enjoyed the title of Great. The intention of this is &s;elf-evident. The name of Henry IV. recalls the idea of his popularity; the &s;overeigns of France are proud to have de&s;cended from this hero, and are taught to look up to him as a model. It is under the &s;helter of his venerable name that all the con|&s;pirators again&s;t the laws, again&s;t religion, and again&s;t good order, have dared to per|&s;uade their king, that he ought to abandon all the precautions of power to the de&s;igns of ambition. After having thus di&s;armed, they have re&s;olved to deliver their &s;overeign, his nobility, and his magi&s;trates (the natural
<PB N="9" REF="6">
&s;upporters of his throne) into the hands of thieves and of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins.</P>
<P>It was a long time &s;ince this plot was fir&s;t formed. It was re&s;olved to put it into execution according to circum&s;tances; and the mode adopted, of everywhere &s;u&s;pend|ing the portraits of Henry IV. was one of the means employed for the &s;ucce&s;s of the de|&s;ign:&mdash;a means truly perfidious, as it holds &s;nares to the unwary, and catches mankind by the bait of their own virtues.</P>
<P>Every time that this politic prince had oc|ca&s;ion to deliver one of his in&s;inuating har|rangues (which was very often) he took par|ticular care not to be too literal in his expre&s;|&s;ions. It was, I &s;uppo&s;e to a kind of A&s;&s;em|bly of Notables that he &s;poke of his de&s;ign to free him&s;elf entirely from their re&s;traint. But when he employed the&s;e courtly threats, of which, by the bye, he was very liberal, he advanced his right foot, and, as he him|&s;elf &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"always clapt his hand upon the hilt of his &s;word.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="7">
Tho&s;e men who&s;e power is envied, and again&s;t whom violent factions are formed, cannot with &s;afety be good in any other manner. Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, and all others in &s;imilar &s;ituations, who have dared to be virtuous, could never have en|joyed this arduous and critical pre-emi|nence but by inviolably pur&s;uing all means in their power of attracting re&s;pect, and of &s;u&s;taining their authority. Without this, they could not have exerci&s;ed their benevo|lence.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;ituation, a prince may with &s;afety, and with as much &s;agacity as glory, divide his authority with his people; be|cau&s;e then he has the power to divide it at his di&s;cretion, and is not forced to aban|don it.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the honour annexed to &s;uch a voluntary divi&s;ion, whatever may be the political motive that can induce a &s;o|vereign to make &s;uch a &s;acrifice in certain ca&s;es, Henry IV. neither did the one nor the other: he never, in any manner whatever,
<PB N="11" REF="8">
parted with an atom of his authority. Did ever he leave it to the judgment of the ci|tizens of Paris to determine the right which the laws of the kingdom gave him of being their king and their &s;overeign? Did they ever enter into any treaty with him con|cerning his title to the throne? Where is there in the long catalogue of the unli|mited prerogatives of the kings of France (be they ju&s;t or unju&s;t) an article which he ever abandoned, limited, or even &s;ubmitted to enquiry? He would have been &s;till more illu&s;trious, if, after having purcha&s;ed and conquered his kingdom, he had done this, and if he had become the founder of a regu|lar con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Hi&s;torical facts have not furni&s;hed me with the means of deciding in a proper manner if ever he found him&s;elf in a &s;itua|tion to acquire this glory, or if he then could have made any attempts of that kind with a greater degree of &s;afety than has been done on a recent occa&s;ion. But it is very probable that he never had any of this kind. If you read the Memoirs of Sully with at|tention
<PB N="12" REF="9">
(and I &s;uppo&s;e that the opinions of the mini&s;ter differed but little from tho&s;e of his ma&s;ter) you will ea&s;ily perceive that they were both royali&s;ts in all the extent of expre&s;&s;ion; and with &s;ome few exceptions they con&s;tantly maintained that &s;pecies of government.</P>
<P>As to the blood that Henry &s;hed, he never &s;pilt one drop more than was nece&s;|&s;ary for the maintenance of his <HI>Right;</HI> which he on no occa&s;ion would &s;ubmit to any &s;pecies of popular deci&s;ion: he how|ever could <HI>kill</HI> when it was nece&s;&s;ary. How many bloody battles did he not fight again&s;t the majority of the French nation? How many cities did he not &s;ack and pillage! Was his mini&s;ter a&s;hamed of &s;haring the booty that fell into his hands? It is true, that while clo&s;ely be&s;ieging his own capital, he relieved and protected the unfortunate families who, at the peril of their lives, &s;al|lied forth to gather a &s;canty harve&s;t under the walls of this very capital. I approve this conduct, but it does not in&s;pire me with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admiration. He would have almo&s;t been a mon&s;ter in cruelty, and
<PB N="13" REF="10">
an idiot in politics, had he done otherwi&s;e. But while he was &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate to a few wretches dying of hunger, one can|not forget that it was he him&s;elf who fa|mi&s;hed them, by hundreds and by thou|&s;ands, before he was in a &s;ituation to treat thus compa&s;&s;ionately a few i&s;olated indi|viduals. It is true, indeed, that in &s;tarving Paris, he did nothing but what was con|formable to the right of war: but that was a right which he enforced in all its pleni|tude. He followed the dictates of his heart and of his policy in the acts of compa&s;&s;ion attributed to him: as to the famine which he occa&s;ioned, it was in con&s;equence of the po&s;ition of his army. But can you &s;upport the panegyri&s;ts of Henry IV. in regard to this very &s;iege of Paris, when you recollect the late deplorable &s;carcity, and, above all, what has been done in con&s;equence of that unhappy epoch? Of the occurrences that followed I &s;hall not &s;peak at pre&s;ent, al|though I think that <HI>that</HI> ought to be done, to in&s;pire every hone&s;t heart with horror and indignation.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="11">
As to the "Scaffold,"&mdash;it is impo&s;&s;ible to decide at this moment, whether it would not have been more prudent for Henry IV. to have &s;aved Marechal de Biron, in&s;tead of cutting off his head within the walis of the Ba&s;tile. He was under great obliga|tions to this Marechal of France, as well as to his father; but Henry was le&s;s remark|able for his <HI>gratitude</HI> than for his <HI>clemency.</HI> As he never &s;hed blood but for ju&s;t rea&s;ons, I &s;uppo&s;e that he thought him&s;elf obliged to do it then, on account of the good of his people, and the &s;ecurity of his throne. It mu&s;t be allowed, however, that if he had pardoned this ra&s;h and impetuous man, he would never have been reproached with this act of commi&s;eration.</P>
<P>If he imagined that the Marechal de Biron was capable of &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;cenes which we have lately &s;een exhibited in your kingdom; if he &s;uppo&s;ed that he might produce the &s;ame anarchy, the &s;ame confu|&s;ion and the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s, as the prelimina|ries to a humiliating and vexatious tyranny, which were on the point of beholding e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
<PB N="15" REF="12">
in France under the name of a Con|&s;titution,&mdash;it was right, very right, to cut, on its very formation, the fir&s;t thread of &s;o many trea&s;ons.</P>
<P>He would never have merited the crown that he acquired, and which he wore with &s;o much glory, if interpo&s;ing his compa&s;&s;ion to defeat the pre&s;ervative effects of a &s;evere execution, he had &s;crupled to puni&s;h tho&s;e traitors and enemies of their country and of the human race;&mdash;for, believe me, there can be no virtue where there is no wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Weakne&s;s only (that is to &s;ay, the parent and the ally of crimes) could have allowed it&s;elf to be affected by mi&s;deeds which have a connection with power, and which aim at the u&s;urpation of a certain degree of au|thority. To pardon &s;uch enemies, is to do the &s;ame thing as tho&s;e who attempt the de&s;truction of religion, of the laws, of po|licy, and of the pro&s;perity of indu&s;try, of li|berty, and of the pro&s;perity of your country. If Henry IV. had &s;uch &s;ubjects as tho&s;e who rule France at this very moment, he would do nothing more than his duty in puni&s;h|ing them.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="13">
The pre&s;ent Sovereign is in the &s;ituation of a victim, and not the avenger of rebellion. It is rather a misfortune than a crime, that he has not prevented this Revolution with that vigorous precaution, that activity, and that momentary deci&s;ion which character|ized Henry IV.</P>
<P>Louis XVI. according to what I hear and believe, has received from nature as perfect an under&s;tanding, and a heart as &s;oft and humane, as his illu&s;trious ance&s;tor. The&s;e are indeed the <HI>elements</HI> of virtue; but he was born under the <HI>canopy of a Throne,</HI> and was not prepared by adver&s;ity for a &s;itua|tion, the trials of which the mo&s;t perfect and the mo&s;t ab&s;olute virtue could have &s;carce re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>As to the proceedings, the men, the means, the pretexts, the projects, the con|&s;equences ari&s;ing from fal&s;e plans and fal&s;e calculations of every nature and of every &s;pecies, which have reduced this Sovereign to appear in no better light than an in&s;trument for the ruin of his country&mdash;the&s;e are cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="17" REF="14">

<P>The&s;e remarks, Sir, have been occa&s;ioned by reading your Letter; you may print them as an Appendix to your work, or in what|ever manner you plea&s;e; or you may keep them for your own private &s;atisfaction&mdash;I leave it intirely to your di&s;cretion.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Duke Street, St. James's, <DATE>Feb. 11, 1791.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I mu&s;t beg your favourable Interpretation of my long Silence. I have really been en|gaged in Bu&s;ine&s;s which has occupied my whole Mind, and made me &s;omewhat ne|gligent in the Attentions which are mo&s;t ju&s;tly due from me. Among&s;t tho&s;e I mu&s;t reckon what I owe to you, for your Communication of the Sentiments of the Abbe Maury, and for the very polite and obliging Manner in which you have made that Communication.</P>
<P>I have to thank you for the excellent Speeches of the Abbe's, which, until your
<PB N="20" REF="16">
Goodne&s;s furni&s;hed me with them, I had never read. I had never before &s;een any Thing of his which could furni&s;h a proper Idea of his Manner of healing a Subject. I had &s;een him only in detached Pieces, and &s;ometimes, I apprehend, under the Di&s;ad|vantage of a Repre&s;entation of his Enemies.&mdash;Even in that Form I thought I per|ceived the Traces of a &s;uperior Mind.</P>
<P>The Pieces which you have been &s;o kind as to put into my Hands, have more than ju&s;tified the Ideas I had formed of him from Reputation. I find there a bold, manly, commanding, haughty, Tone of Eloquence; free and rapid, and full of Re&s;ources: but admiring, as I do, his Elo|quence, I admire much more his unwearied Per&s;everance, his invincible Con&s;tancy, his firm Intrepidity, his undaunted Courage, and his noble Defiance of vulgar Opinion, and public Clamor. The&s;e are real Foun|dations of Glory. Whenever he &s;hall get rid of the Dangers of his Inviolability, and &s;hall wi&s;h to relax in the Ea&s;e and free Intercour&s;e of this Land of Slavery (in
<PB N="21" REF="17">
which he has nothing to dread from a Com|mittee of Re&s;earches, or the excellent Laws of <HI>le&s;e Nation</HI>) he &s;hall, with a very &s;incere and open Heart, receive from me the <HI>acco|lade Chevalere&s;que,</HI> which he conde&s;cends to de&s;ire: for he has acquitted him&s;elf <HI>en preux Chevalier,</HI> and as a valiant Champion in the Cau&s;e of Honor, Virtue, and noble Sentiments; in the Cau&s;e of his King and his Country, in the Cau&s;e of Law, Religion, and Liberty. Be plea&s;ed only to expre&s;s my Sorrow, that the Mediocrity of my Situation, and the very bad French which I &s;peak, will, neither of them, &s;uffer me to entertain him with the Di&s;tinction I &s;hould wi&s;h to &s;hew him. I will do the be&s;t I can.</P>
<P>I have had the Count de Mirabeau in my Hou&s;e&mdash;will he &s;ubmit afterwards to enter under the &s;ame Roof? I will have it puri|fied and expiated, and I &s;hall look into the be&s;t <HI>Formulas,</HI> from the Time of Homer downwards, for that Purpo&s;e; I will do every thing but irritate the Spaniard who burned his Hou&s;e, becau&s;e the <HI>Connetable</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="18">
<HI>de Bourbon</HI> had lodged in it. That Cere|mony is too expen&s;ive for my Finances. Any Thing el&s;e I &s;hall readily &s;ubmit to, for its Purification; for I am <HI>extremely &s;u|per&s;titious,</HI> and think his coming into it was of evil Augury; wor&s;e, a great deal, than the Crows which the Abbe will find continually flying about me. It is his having been in &s;o many Pri&s;ons in France, that has proved &s;o ominous to them all.</P>
<P>Let the Hall of the National A&s;&s;embly talk to it&s;elf, and take Means of averting the &s;ame ill Au&s;pices that threaten it. They are a fine Nation that &s;end their Monarchs to Pri&s;on, and take their Suc|ce&s;&s;ors from the Jails! The Birth of &s;uch Mon&s;ters has made me as &s;uper&s;titious as they. A Friend of mine ju&s;t come from Paris, tells me, he was pre&s;ent when the Count de Mirabeau (I beg his Pardon) Mr. Ricquetti, thought proper to entertain the A&s;&s;embly with his Opinion of me. I only an&s;wer him by referring him to the <HI>World</HI>'s Opinion of <HI>him.</HI> I have the Hap|pine&s;s not to be di&s;approved by my Sove|reign.
<PB N="23" REF="19">
I can bear the Frowns of Ricquetti the Fir&s;t who is theirs. I am &s;afe under the Briti&s;h Laws.&mdash;I do not intend to put my&s;elf in the Way of his Inqui&s;ition, or of his <HI>lanterne;</HI> which I con&s;ider as much more dangerous to hone&s;t Men, though not to him, than the Ba&s;tille was formerly.</P>
<P>If I were to go to France, I &s;hould think the Government of Louis XVI. much more favorable to Liberty than that of their pre&s;ent King, Ricquetti the Fir&s;t. In one Thing, indeed, I find him, though he was a bad Subject, to me at lea&s;t, a kind Sovereign; &s;ince, in &s;peaking of me, he has done it in the only Way which could contribute either to my Satisfaction or Re|putation.</P>
<P>To be the Subject of Mon&s;ieur Ricquetti's Invectives, and of Abbe Maury's Appro|bation at the &s;ame Time, is an Honor to which little can be added. Mirabeau in his Jail would be an Object of my Pity; on his Throne (which by the Sport of
<PB N="24" REF="20">
Fortune may be the Reward of what&mdash;commonly leads to what I don't chu&s;e to name) he is the Object of my Di&s;dain. For Vice is never &s;o odious, and to rational Eyes, never &s;o contemptible, as when it u&s;urps and di&s;graces the natural Place of Virtue; and Virtue is never more amiable to all who have a true Ta&s;te for Beauty, than when &s;he is naked and &s;tripp'd of all the borrowed Ornaments of Fortune.</P>
<P>Mr. Cazales and Abbe Maury have de|rived Advantages to their Fame from their Di&s;a&s;ters, which they never could have had from the mo&s;t pro&s;perous Event of their Conflicts; which, however, I wi&s;h may come in the End, not for their own Sakes, but for the Benefit of Mankind.</P>
<CLOSER>I have the Honor to be, &amp;c.
