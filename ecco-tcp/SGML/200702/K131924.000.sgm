<HEAD>Sally of our Alley.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>OF all the girls in our town</L>
<L>There's none like pretty Sally,</L>
<L>She is the darling of my heart;</L>
<L>And lives in our alley:</L>
<L>There's ne'er a lady in the land</L>
<L>Is half &s;o &s;weet as Sally,</L>
<L>She is the darling of my heart,</L>
<L>And lives in our alley.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her father he makes cabbage nets,</L>
<L>And in the &s;treets does cry them,</L>
<L>Her mother &s;he &s;ells laces long,</L>
<L>To all who chu&s;e to buy them;</L>
<L>But &s;ure &s;uch folks could ne'er beget</L>
<L>So &s;weet a girl as Sally,</L>
<L>She is the darling, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Sally's by I leave my work,</L>
<L>I love her &s;o &s;incerely,</L>
<L>My ma&s;ter comes like any Turk,</L>
<L>And bangs me mo&s;t &s;everely,</L>
<L>But let him bang his belly full,</L>
<L>I'll bear it all for Sally, &s;he is, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of all the days that's in the week,</L>
<L>I dearly love but one day,</L>
<L>And that's the day that comes between</L>
<L>A Saturday and Monday:</L>
<L>O then I'm dre&s;t in all my be&s;t,</L>
<L>To walk abroad with Sally, &s;he is, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My ma&s;ter carries me to church,</L>
<L>And often I am blamed,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e I leave him in the lurch,</L>
<L>As &s;oon as text is named:</L>
<L>I leave the church in &s;ermon time,</L>
<L>And &s;link away to Sally, &s;he is, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When Chri&s;tmas comes about again,</L>
<L>O then I &s;hall have money,</L>
<L>I'll hoard it up, and box and all,</L>
<L>I'll give it to my Sally,</L>
<L>And would it were a thou&s;and pounds,</L>
<L>I'd give it all to Sally, &s;he is, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My ma&s;ter and the neighbours all</L>
<L>Make game of me and Sally,</L>
<L>And but for her I'd better be</L>
<L>A &s;lave, and row a galley;</L>
<L>But when my &s;even long years are out,</L>
<L>O then I'll marry Sally,</L>
<L>O then we'll wed, and then we'll bed,</L>
<L>But not in our alley.</L>
