<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT very much &s;urprizes me that &s;ix Editions of a Mythological Pam|phlet, entituled, <HI>A Di&s;&s;ertation on Dumpling,</HI> &s;hould e&s;cape your No|tice of that wonderful Unriddler of My|&s;teries the ingenious Mr. <HI>E&mdash;C</HI>&mdash;who has at the &s;ame Time given &s;uch Proofs of his Abilities in his many and mo&s;t elaborate Keys to <HI>Gulliver</HI>'s Travels; Keys, which <HI>Gulliver</HI> him&s;elf could ne|ver have found out! and withal, &s;o per|tinent, that I &s;hall e&s;teem tho&s;e at the Helm, no great Lovers of Learning, if my Friend <HI>Edmund</HI> be not forthwith pro|moted: for as the Sweetne&s;s of a Kernel
<PB N="2" REF="4">
is uncomatable, but by the Fracture of its Shell, &s;o is the Beauty of a My&s;tery altogether hid, till the Expounder has riddlemayreed the Propounder's Problem, and render'd it obvious to the meane&s;t Capacity.</P>
<P>The only Plea I can u&s;e in Mr. <HI>C&mdash;'s</HI> bchalf, is, that the Author of the Di&s;|&s;ertation has been a little too free with his Character, which probably occa&s;ioned that Sullenne&s;s in our <HI>Briti&s;h Oedipus;</HI> who in Order to be revenged, has deter|mined not to embeli&s;h the Work with his Interpretation, but rather let it rot and peri&s;h in Oblivion.</P>
<P>This, and nothing el&s;e, could be the Rea&s;on of &s;o profound a Silence in &s;o great a My&s;terymonger, to remedy which Lo&s;s to the Publick, I an unworthy Scribler, and faint Copier of that great Arti&s;t, pre|&s;ume with aching Heart, and trembling Hand, to draw the Veil which &s;hades the political Pamphlet in Que&s;tion; and &s;how it to my loving Countrymen in <HI>Puris Naturalibus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">
If I &s;ucceed in this, I hope Mr. <HI>L&mdash;t,</HI> who all the World knows is a rare Chap to his Authors, will &s;peedily employ me to unriddle, or at lea&s;t make a Plot to the <HI>Rival Modes,</HI> which it &s;eems the Au|thor has omitted: it is true, he ought to have given it the Book&s;eller with the Copy, but has not &s;o done, which makes me wonder he is not &s;ued for Breach of Covenant; but what is that to me, if I get a Job by the Bargain? Let Book&s;ellers beware how they buy Plays without Plots for the future.</P>
<P>I narrowly mi&s;s'd &s;olving the Problem called <HI>Wagner</HI> and <HI>Abericock;</HI> Mr. <HI>B</HI>&mdash;had &s;poke to Mr. <HI>W&mdash;</HI>to &s;peak to Mr. <HI>C&mdash;,</HI> who had ju&s;t con&s;ented to employ me, after having made me abate half my Demand: But Hou&s;es running thin, <HI>Colley</HI> has undertaken the Job him|&s;elf to &s;ave Charges; intending at the &s;ame Time, to annex a &s;evere Critici&s;m on <HI>Pluto</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;erpine.</HI></P>
<P>This, gentle Reader, will, I hope, in|duce you to look on me as a Writer of &s;ome Regard, and at the &s;ame Time,<HI><PB N="4" REF="6"></HI>to make a little Allowance for whatever Errors my great Hurry may occa&s;ion, be|ing obliged to write Night and Day, Sun|days and working Days, without the lea&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance. All our Journeymen Writers being now turned Ma&s;ters, I am left to &s;hi&s;t for my &s;elf; but am bringing up my Wife to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and doubt not but a long War, and our mutual Indu&s;try, may rub off old Scores, and make us begin a new Reckoning with all Mankind; Pam|phleteering having been &s;o dead for many Years la&s;t pa&s;t, that (God forgive me!) I have been oftentimes tempted to write Trea&s;on for mere Su&s;tenance.</P>
<P>But Thanks to better Stars and better Days, the Pen revives, and Authors flouri&s;h; more Money can be made now of a Play, nay, though it be a &s;curvy One, than <HI>Dryden</HI> got by all his Works. There&s;ore now or never is the Time to &s;trike while the Iron is hot, to write my &s;elf out of Debt, and into Place, and then grow idle and laugh at the World, as my Betters have done before me.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a Book has met with Succe&s;s, it never wants a Father; there being tho&s;e good natured Souls in the World, who, rather than let Man|kind think &s;uch Productions &s;prang of them&s;elves, will own the Vaga|bond Brat, and thereby become Fa|thers of other Mens Offsprings.</P>
<P>This was the Fate of Dumpling, who&s;e real Father did not take more Care to conceal him&s;elf, than &s;ome did to be thought its Author; but if any one will recollect the Time of its Publication, they will find it with|in
<PB N="6" REF="8">
a Week after the Arrival of D&mdash;n <HI>S&mdash;t,</HI> from <HI>Ireland;</HI> the Occa&s;ion, as I am very well informed, was this, the D&mdash;n, one of the fir&s;t Things he did, went to pay a Vi&s;it to Mr. <HI>T&mdash;,</HI> his old Book&s;eller; but, to his Sur|prize, found both the Brothers dead, and a Relation in the Shop, to whom he was an utter Stranger. Mr. <HI>M&mdash;</HI>for &s;uch is this Per&s;on's Name, ga|thering from the D&mdash;n's Enquiries who he was, paid him his <HI>Devoirs</HI> in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful Manner, &s;olicited his Friend&s;hip, and invited him to a Dinner, which the D&mdash;n was plea&s;ed to accept. By the Way, you mu&s;t know, he is a great Lover of Dum|pling, as well as the Book&s;eller, who had ordered one for him&s;elf, little dreaming of &s;uch a Gue&s;t that Day. The Dinner, as 'twas not provided on purpo&s;e, was but a Family one, well enough however for a Book&s;eller; that is to &s;ay, a couple of Fowls, Bacon and Sprouts boiled, and a Forequarter
<PB N="7" REF="9">
of Lamb roa&s;ted. After the u&s;ual Com|plements for the unexpected Honour, and the old Apology of wi&s;hing it was better for his &s;ake: The Maid, &s;illy Girl! came and asked her Ma&s;ter if he plea&s;ed to have his Dumpling; he would have chid her, but the D&mdash;n mollified him, in&s;i&s;ting at the &s;ame Time, upon the Introduction of Dum|pling, which accordingly was done. Dumpling gave Cau&s;e of Conver&s;a|tion, but not till it was eat; for the Reader mu&s;t under&s;tand, that both the Gentlemen play a good Knife and Fork, and are too mannerly to talk with their Mouths full. The Dum|pling eat, as I &s;aid before, the D&mdash;n drank to the Book&s;eller, the Book|&s;eller to the Author, and with an ob&s;equious Smile, &s;eem'd to &s;ay ah! Dear Doctor, you have been a Friend to my Predece&s;&s;or, can you do nothing for me? The D&mdash;n took the Hint, and after a profound Contemplation, cry'd, Why ay&mdash;Dumpling will do&mdash;
<PB N="8" REF="10">
put me in Mind of Dumpling anon, but not a Word more at pre&s;ent, and good Rea&s;on why, Dinner was coming in. So they pa&s;t the re&s;t of the Meal with great Silence and Application, and no doubt dined well. Far otherwi&s;e was it with me that Day: I remem|ber to my Sorrow, I had a Hogs Maw, without Salt or Mu&s;tard; ha|ing at that Time, Credit with the Pork-Woman, but not with the Chandler: Times are &s;ince mended, <HI>Amen</HI> to the Continuance!</P>
<P>The D&mdash;n, having eat and drank plentifully, began his u&s;ual Plea&s;ant|ries, and made the Book&s;eller mea|&s;ure his Ears with his Mouth, nay, bur&s;t his Sides with Laughter; how|ever, he found Interval enough to re|mind the D&mdash;n of Dumpling, who asked him if he had a quick Hand at Writing: he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, being naturally as Lazy as the other was In|dolent, &s;o they contrived to ea&s;e them|&s;elves by &s;ending for a Hackney Wri|ter
<PB N="9" REF="11">
out of <HI>Temple Lane</HI> to be the D&mdash;'s <HI>Amanuen&s;is,</HI> while he and his new Acquaintance crack'd t'other Bottle.</P>
<P>This Account may be depended up|on, becau&s;e I had it from the Man him&s;elf, who &s;corns to tell a Lye.</P>
<P>To be &s;hort, my Friend had the wor&s;t of it, being kept to hard Wri|ting, without Drinking (Churls that they were) about three Hours; in which Time the Di&s;&s;ertation was fi|ni&s;hed, that is to &s;ay, from Page 1. to Page 25. the re&s;t might probably be done at &s;ome other lei&s;ure Time, to fill up the Chinks, but of that he knows nothing; &s;ufficient is it that the D&mdash;n was the Author. Pro|ceed we now to the other Di&s;cove|ries, by drawing the Veil from before the Book it &s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>A KEY TO THE DISSERTATION ON <HI>DUMPLING.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_I Shall begin with his Motto, which &s;ays, <HI>What is bet|ter than a Pudding?</HI> The Body owns its Power, the Mind, its Delicacy; it will give Youth to grey Hairs, and Life to the mo&s;t De&s;ponding: Therefore are
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Pudding Eaters of great U&s;e in State Affairs.</P>
<P>This Quotation is of a Piece with his Motto to the Tale of a Tub, and other Writings; altogether Fictiti|ous and Drole: he adds to the Je&s;t, by putting an Air of Authority or genuine Quotation from &s;ome great Author; when alas! the whole is mere Farce and Invention.</P>
<P>The Dedication is one continued Sneer upon Authors, and their Pa|trons, and &s;eems to carry a Glance of Deri&s;ion towards Men of Quality in General; by &s;etting a Cook above them, as a more u&s;eful Member in a body Politick. Some will have this <HI>Braund,</HI> to be Sir ****, others Sir ****, others Sir ****; but I take it to be more Railery than My&s;tery, and that Mr. <HI>Braund,</HI> at the <HI>Rummer</HI> in <HI>Queen-&s;treet,</HI> is the Per&s;on; who ha|ving pleas'd the Author in two or three Entertainments, he, with a View truly <HI>Epicurean,</HI> con&s;titutes him
<PB N="13" REF="14">
his <HI>Maecenas;</HI> as being more agreeable to him than a whole Circle of Stars and Garters, of what Colour or De|nomination &s;oever.</P>
<P>In his Tale of a Tub, he has a fling at Dependance, and Attendance, where he talks of a Body worn out with Poxes ill cured, and Shooes with Dependance, and Attendance. Not having the Book by me, I am forced to quote at Random, but I hope the courteous Reader will bear me out. He complains of it again in this Treati&s;e, and makes a Comple|ment to Mr. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Braund</HI>'s late Servant; who keeps the <HI>Braund</HI>'s <HI>Head</HI> in <HI>New Bond-&s;treet,</HI> near <HI>Hanover-Square;</HI> a Hou&s;e of great Elegance, and where he u&s;ed frequently to dine.</P>
<P>The Di&s;tinction of <HI>Brand, Braund,</HI> and <HI>Barnes,</HI> is a Banter on Criticks, and Genealogi&s;ts, who make &s;uch a Pother about the Orthography of Names and Things, that many Times, three Parts in four of a Folio Treati&s;e,
<PB N="14" REF="15">
is taken up in a&s;certaining the Pro|priety of a Syllable, by which Means the Reader is left undetermined; having nothing but the various Read|ings on a &s;ingle Word, and that pro|bably, of &s;mall Importance.</P>
<P>I heartily wi&s;h &s;ome of the&s;e Glo&s;|&s;ographi&s;ts would oblige the World with a Folio Treati&s;e or two, on the Word Rabbet: We &s;hall then know whether it is to be &s;pelt with an <HI>e,</HI> or an <HI>i.</HI> For, to the Shame of the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Tongue and this learned Age, our mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians, Sur|geons, Anatomi&s;ts and Men Mid|wives, have all been to &s;eek in this Affair.</P>

<P>And &s;ome of the&s;e great Wits, have &s;uch &s;hort Memories, that they
<PB N="15" REF="16">
&s;pell it both Ways in one and the &s;ame Page.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter-Key to this My&s;tery, is the Explanation of its Terms; for Example, by <HI>Dumpling</HI> is meant a Place, or any other Reward or En|couragement. A <HI>Pudding</HI> &s;ignifies a P&mdash;t, and &s;ometimes a C&mdash;tee. A <HI>Dumpling Eater,</HI> is a Dependant on the Court, or, in a Word, any one who will rather pocket an Affront than be angry at a Tip in Time. A <HI>Cook</HI> is a Mini&s;ter of State. The <HI>Epicurean</HI> and <HI>Peripatetic</HI> Sects, are the two Par|ties of <HI>Whigg</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> who both are greedy enough of Dumpling.</P>
<P>The Author cannot forbear his old Sneer upon Foreigners, but &s;ays, in his 1&s;t Page, <Q>That finding it a Land of Plenty, they wi&s;ely re&s;olved never to go home again,</Q> and in his 2d, <Q>Nay, &s;o zealous are they in the Cau&s;e of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> that one of the Chief a|mong them, made a Vow never to &s;ay his Prayers till he has a
<PB N="16" REF="17">
Tavern of his own in every Street in <HI>London,</HI> and in every Market-Town in <HI>England:</HI></Q> If he does not mean Sir <HI>J&mdash;T&mdash;</HI>I know not who he means.</P>
<P>By the Invention of <HI>Eggs,</HI> Page 4. is meant Perqui&s;ites. <Q>He cannot con|clude a Paragraph, in his 5th <HI>Page,</HI> without owning he received that important Part of the Hi&s;tory of Pudding, from old Mr. <HI>Lawrence</HI> of <HI>Wil&s;den Green,</HI> the greate&s;t Antiqua|ry of the pre&s;ent Age.</Q></P>
<P>This old <HI>Lawrence</HI> is a great Fa|vourite of the D&mdash;'s; he is a facetious Farmer, of above eighty Years of Age, now living at <HI>Wil&s;den Green,</HI> near <HI>Kil|burn</HI> in <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> the mo&s;t rural Place I ever &s;aw: exactly like the Wilds of <HI>Ireland.</HI> It was here the D&mdash;n often retired <HI>incog.</HI> to amu&s;e him&s;elf with the Simplicity of the Place and People; where he got together all that Rig|mayroll of Childrens talk, which com|po&s;es his <HI>Namby Pamby.</HI> Old <HI>Law|rence</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="18">
told me, the D&mdash;n has &s;ate &s;e|veral Hours together to &s;ee the Chil|dren play, with the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure in Life: The re&s;t he learned from the old Nur&s;es thereabouts, of which there are a great many, with whom he would go and &s;moke a Pipe fre|quently, and cordially; not in his Clergyman's Habit, but in a black Suit of Cloth Clothes, and without a Ro&s;e in his Hat: Which made them conclude him to be a Presbyterian Par&s;on.</P>
<P>This Mention of old <HI>Lawrence,</HI> is in Ridicule to a certain great Arti&s;t, who wrote a Treati&s;e upon the Word <HI>Connoi&s;&s;eur</HI> (or a Knower) and confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to have been many Years at a lo&s;s for a Word to expre&s;s the Acti|on of Knowing, till the great Mr. <HI>Prior</HI> gave him Ea&s;e, by furni&s;hing him with the Word <HI>Connoi&s;&s;ance.</HI> Our D&mdash;n had drawn a Drole, Parallel to this, <HI>viz. Boudineur,</HI> a Pudding Pye|man; and <HI>Boudinance,</HI> the making of
<PB N="18" REF="19">
Pudding Pies: But &s;everal Men of Quality begging it off, it was, at their Reque&s;t, &s;cratch'd out, but my Friend, the <HI>Amanuen&s;is,</HI> remembers particularly its being originally in&s;erted.</P>
<P>If the Reader &s;hould ask, Who is that K<HI>&mdash;John</HI> mentioned in the fourth Page, and which I ought to have ta|ken in its Place. I beg leave to inform him, that by K. <HI>John</HI> is meant the late Q.&mdash;, with whom the D&mdash;of <HI>M&mdash;</HI>was many Years in &s;uch great Favour, that he was nick named K. <HI>John;</HI> it was in that Part of the Q&mdash;'s Reign, that Sir <HI>John</HI> Pudding, by whom is meant **** <HI>you know who,</HI> came in Favour; it is true, the Name is odd, and &s;eems to carry an Air of Ridicule with it, but the Cha|racter given him by this allegorical Writer, is that of an able State&s;man, and an hone&s;t Man.</P>
<P>And here, begging Mr. D&mdash;n's Par|don, I cannot but think his Wit has out run his Judgment; for he puts
<PB N="19" REF="20">
the Cart before the Hor&s;e, and begins at the latter Part of Sir **** Admi|ni&s;tration: But this might be owing to too plentiful a Dinner, and too much of the Creature. Be that as it will, I mu&s;t follow my Copy, and ex|plain it as it lies. Proceed we there|fore to the Di&s;&s;ertation, <HI>Page</HI> 6.</P>
<P><Q>But what rais'd our Hero mo&s;t in the E&s;teem of this Pudding-eating Monarch, was his &s;econd Edition of Pudding, he being the fir&s;t that ever invented the Art of broiling Puddings, which he did to &s;uch Per|fection, and &s;o much to the King's liking (who had a mortal Aver&s;ion to cold Pudding) that he thereupon in&s;tituted him Knight of the Grid|iron, and gave him a Gridiron of Gold, the En&s;ign of that Order; which he always wore as a Mark of his Sovereign's Favour.</Q></P>
<P>If this does not mean the late Re|vival of an ancient Order of Knight|hood, I never will unriddle My&s;tery
<PB N="20" REF="21">
more: To prove which, we need but cro&s;s over to the next Page, where he tells us, <Q>Sir <HI>John</HI> had always a Squire, who followed him, bearing a huge Pair of Spectacles to &s;addle his Honour's No&s;e. <BIBL><HI>Di&s;&s;. Page</HI> 7.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>After this, he very &s;everely runs upon tho&s;e would-be State&s;men, who put them&s;elves in Competition with his Favourite, Sir ****, with whom he became exceeding intimate, and almo&s;t in&s;eperable, all the Time he was in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Story of the Kit Cat Club, <HI>Dick E&s;tcourt,</HI> and <HI>Jacob Ton&s;on,</HI> is a mere Digre&s;&s;ion; and nothing more to the Purpo&s;e, than that we may ima|gine it came uppermo&s;t. He returns to his Subject in his 9th <HI>Page.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Now it was Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Method, every <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, to give the Courtiers a Breakfa&s;t; which Break|fa&s;t was every Man his Dumpling, and Cup of Wine: For you mu&s;t know, he was Yeoman of the
<PB N="21" REF="22">
Wine-Cellar at the &s;ame Time.</Q></P>
<P>The Breakfa&s;t is Sir *** Levee, the Yeoman&s;hip of the Wine-Cellar, is the ***.</P>
<P>The Author of the Di&s;&s;ertation, is a very bad Chronologi&s;t; for at <HI>Page</HI> 10. we are obliged to go back to the former Reign, where we &s;hall find the lubberly Abbots <HI>(i. e.)</HI> the High Church Prie&s;ts, mi&s;repre&s;enting Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Actions, and never let the Q&mdash;alone, till poor Sir <HI>John</HI> was di&s;carded.</P>
<Q><P>This was a great Eye-&s;ore, and Heart-burning to &s;ome lubberly Abbots, who lounged about the Court; they took it in great Dudge|on they were not invited, and &s;tuck &s;o clo&s;e to his Skirts, that they ne|ver re&s;ted till they outed him. They told the King, who was naturally very ha&s;ty, that Sir <HI>John,</HI> made|away with his Wine, and fea&s;ted his <HI>Paramours</HI> at his Expence; and not only &s;o, but they were
<PB N="22" REF="23">
forming a De&s;ign again&s;t his Life, which they in Con&s;cience ought to di&s;cover: That Sir <HI>John</HI> was not only an Heretic, but an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">; nay, wor&s;e, they fear'd he was a Witch, and that he had bewitch'd his Maje&s;ty into that unaccountable Fondne&s;s for a <HI>Pudding-Maker.</HI> They a&s;&s;ured the King, that on a <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, in&s;tead of being at Mat|tins, he and his Trigrimates got together hum jum, all &s;nug, and perform'd many helli&s;h and diabo|lical Ceremonies. In &s;hort, they made the King believe that the Moon was made of Green-Chee&s;e: And to &s;hew how the Innocent may be bely'd, and the be&s;t Intentions mi&s;repre&s;ented, they told the King, That he and his A&s;&s;ociates offered Sacrifices to <HI>Ceres:</HI> When, alas, it was only the Dumplings they eat.</P>
<P>The Butter which was melted and poured over them, the&s;e vile Mi&s;|creants, called <HI>Libations:</HI> And the
<PB N="23" REF="24">
friendly Compotations of our Dum|pling Eaters, were called <HI>Bacchana|lian Rites.</HI> Two or three among them being &s;weet tooth'd, would &s;trew a little Sugar over their Dum|plings; this was repre&s;ented as an <HI>Heatheni&s;h Offering.</HI> In &s;hort, not one Action of theirs, but which the&s;e ra&s;cally Abbots made criminal, and never let the King alone till Sir <HI>John</HI> was di&s;carded; not but the King did it with the greate&s;t Re|luctance; but they made it a reli|gious Concern, and he could not get off on't. <BIBL><HI>Di&s;&s;. pag.</HI> 10.</BIBL></P></Q>
<P>All the World knows that the <HI>Tory</HI> Mini&s;try got uppermo&s;t, for the four la&s;t Years of the Queen's Reign, and by their unaccountable Management, teaz'd that good Lady out of her Life: Which occa&s;ion'd the D&mdash;n in his ele|venth Page to &s;ay; <Q>Then too late he &s;aw his Error; then he lamented the Lo&s;s of Sir <HI>John;</HI> and in his late&s;t Moments, would cry out, Oh!
<PB N="24" REF="25">
that I had never parted from my dear <HI>Jack-Pudding!</HI> Would I had never left off Pudding and Dum|pling! then I had never been thus ba&s;ely poi&s;on'd! never thus treache|rou&s;ly &s;ent out of the World!&mdash;Thus did this good King lament: But alas! to no purpo&s;e, the Prie&s;t had given him his Bane, and Com|plaints were ineffectual.</Q></P>
<P>This alludes to Sir **** Impri&s;on|ment and Di&s;grace in the Year&mdash;Nay, &s;o barefaced is the D&mdash;n in his Allegory, that he tells us, in his 12th Page, <HI>Norfolk</HI> was his A&s;ylum. This is as plain as the No&s;e on a Man's Face! The &s;ub&s;equent Pages are an ex|act De&s;cription of the Ingratitude of Courtiers; and his Fable of the <HI>Court Pudding,</HI> Page 13. is the be&s;t Part of the whole Di&s;&s;ertation.</P>
<P>One would imagine the D&mdash;n had been at Sea, by his writing Catharp|ing-Fa&s;hion, and dodging the Story &s;ometimes Twenty-Years backwards,

at other Times advancing as many; &s;o that one knows not where to have him: for in his fifteenth Page, he returns to the pre&s;ent Scene of Action, and brings his Hero into the Favour of K<HI>&mdash;Harry, alias</HI> **** who being &s;en&s;ible of his Abilities, re&s;tores him into Fa|vour, and makes U&s;e of his admi|rable Skill in Cookery, <HI>alias</HI> State Affairs.</P>
<Q><P>Not one of the King's Cooks could make a Pudding like Sir <HI>John;</HI> nay, though he made a Pud|ding before their Eyes, yet they, out of the very &s;ame Materials, could not do the like: Which made his old Friends, the Monks, attri|bute it to Witchcraft, and it was currently reported the Devil was his Helper. But good King <HI>Harry</HI> was not to be fobb'd off &s;o; the Pudding was good, it &s;at very well on his Stomach, and he eat very &s;avourly, without the lea&s;t Re|mor&s;e of Con&s;cience. <BIBL><HI>Di&s;&s;. Page</HI> 15.</BIBL></P></Q>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27">
This &s;eems to hint at the Oppo|&s;ition Sir **** met with from the contrary Party, and how &s;en&s;ible the K&mdash;was, that they were all unable to hold the Staff in Competition with him.</P>
<P>After this the D&mdash;n runs into a whim&s;ical De&s;cription of his Heroes per&s;onal Virtues; but draws the Pi|cture too much <HI>Alla Carraccatura,</HI> and is, in my Opinion, not only a little too familiar, but wide of his Subject. For begging his Dean&s;hip's Pardon, he mightily betrays his Judgment, when he &s;ays, Sir <HI>John</HI> was no very great Scholar, whereas all Men of Learning allow him to be a mo&s;t excellent one; but as we may &s;uppo&s;e he grew pretty warm by this Time with the Book|&s;ellers Wine, he got into his old Knack of Raillery, and begins to run upon all Mankind: In this Mood he falls up|on <HI>C&mdash;J&mdash;n,</HI> and Sir <HI>R&mdash;Bl&mdash;re,</HI> a Pair of twin Poets, who &s;uck'd one and the &s;ame Mu&s;e. After
<PB N="27" REF="28">
this he has a Fling at <HI>Handel, Bononcini</HI> and <HI>Attilio,</HI> the Opera Compo&s;ers; and a &s;evere Sneer on the late High-Church Idol, <HI>Sacheverel.</HI> As for <HI>Cluer,</HI> the Printer, any Body that knows Mu&s;ic, or <HI>Bow Church Yard,</HI> needs no farther Information.</P>
<P>And now he proceeds to a Digre&s;&s;ion, which is indeed the Di&s;&s;ertation it &s;elf; proving all Arts and Sciences to owe their Origin and Exi&s;tence to <HI>Pudding</HI> and <HI>Dumpling (i. e.)</HI> Encou|ragement. His <HI>Hiatus</HI> in the 20th Page, I could, but dare not Decy|pher.</P>
<P>In his 22d Page, he la&s;hes the Au|thors who oppo&s;e the Government; &s;uch as the <HI>Craft&s;main, Occa&s;ional Wri|ter,</HI> and other Scribblers, pa&s;t, pre|&s;ent, and to come. <HI>The Dumpling-Eaters Downfal,</HI> is a Title of his own Imagination; I have run over all <HI>Wil|ford</HI>'s Catalogues, and &s;ee no Men|tion made of &s;uch a Book: All that Paragraph therefore is a mere Piece of Rablai&s;ci&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">
In his 23d Page, he has another confounded Fling at Foreigners; and after having determinately dubb'd his Hero, the Prince of State&s;men, he concludes his Di&s;&s;ertation with a Me&s;s of Drollery, and goes off in a Laugh.</P>
<P>In a Word, the whole Di&s;&s;ertation &s;eems calculated to ingratiate the D&mdash;n in Sir **** Favour; he draws the Picture of an able and an hone&s;t Mini&s;ter, painful in his Countries Service, and beloved by his Prince; yet oftentimes mi&s;repre&s;ented and be|ly'd: Nay, &s;ometimes on the Brink of Ruin, but always Conqueror. The Fears, the Jealou&s;ies, the Mi&s;repre|&s;entations of an enraged and di&s;ap|pointed Party, give him no &s;mall Un|ea&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee the Ingratitude of &s;ome Men, the Folly of others, who &s;hall believe black to be white, becau&s;e prejudiced and de&s;igning Knaves a|larm 'em with fal&s;e Fears. We &s;ee every Action mi&s;con&s;trued, and Evil made out of Good; but as the be&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="30">
Per&s;ons and Things are &s;ubject to Scandal and Ridicule; &s;o have they the Plea&s;ure of Triumphing in the Truth, which always will prevail.</P>
<P>I take the Allegory of this Di&s;&s;er|tation to be partly Hi&s;torical, partly Prophetical; the D&mdash;n &s;eeming to have carried his View, not only to the pre|&s;ent, but even, &s;ucceeding Times. He &s;ets his Hero down at la&s;t in Peace, Plenty, and a happy Retirement, not unrelented by his Prince; his Hone&s;ty apparent, his Enemies baffled and con|founded, and his Mea&s;ures made the Standard of good Government; and a Pattern for all ju&s;t Mini&s;ters to follow.</P>
<P>Thus, gentle Reader, have I, at the Expence of the&s;e poor Brains, crack'd this thick Shell, and given thee the Kernel. If any &s;hould object, and &s;ay this Expo&s;ition is a Contradiction to the D&mdash;n's Principles; I a&s;&s;ure &s;uch Objector, that the D&mdash;n is an errant <HI>Whig</HI> by Education, and Choice: He may indeed cajole the <HI>Tories</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="31">
with a Belief that he is of their Party; but it is all a Joke, he is a <HI>Whig,</HI> and I know him to be &s;o; Nay more, I can prove it, and defy him to con|tradict me; did he not ju&s;t after his Arrival and Promotion in <HI>Ireland,</HI> writing to one of his intimate Friends in <HI>London,</HI> conclude his Letter in this Manner?</P>
<Q><P><HI>Thus Dear **** from all that has oc|cur'd, you mu&s;t conclude me a</HI> Tory <HI>in every Thing, but my Principle, which is yet as unmoved, as, that I am,</HI></P>
<P>Yours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This Letter, his Tale of a Tub, and in a Word, all his Invectives again&s;t Enthu&s;ia&s;m and Prie&s;tcraft, plainly prove him to be no <HI>Tory;</HI> and if his Intimacy, not only with Sir **** him&s;elf, but mo&s;t of the prime Men in the Mini&s;try, cannot prove him a <HI>Whig,</HI> I have no more to &s;ay.</P>
