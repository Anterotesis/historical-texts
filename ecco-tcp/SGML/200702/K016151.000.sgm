<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e Your Grace,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WHEN I reflect on your Dig|nity, as Fir&s;t Peer of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> the olde&s;t Monar|chy of <HI>Europe,</HI> I addre&s;s you with Dread: And con&s;ider my own Ambition of throwing my &s;elf, and my fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay, in Tragedy, under the Protection of your Illu&s;trious
<PB REF="3">
Name, as a Pre&s;umption, which no A|pology can excu&s;e, unle&s;s I &s;eek it, in your Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>But 'tis both natural and nece&s;&s;ary, for Poets, to court the Favour of the Great: And the Honour, which your Grace's Indulgence vouch&s;afes me, on this Occa&s;ion, di&s;tingui&s;hes you no le&s;s among the Patrons of the <HI>Mu|&s;es,</HI> than your high Birth, among the Noble; for, the &s;maller my Merit may be judged by the World, the more glo|rious that Humanity, which excites your Grace, to encourage it, till 'tis encreas'd by your Influence. Many a Slip might have grown to a tall Cedar, if it had been pal'd round, and wa|ter'd, in&s;tead of being trampled upon. The mo&s;t invi&s;ible Spark may be gra|dualy blown to an illuminating Blaze, and give Delight to its Nouri&s;her.</P>
<P>How ble&s;s'd &s;hould I conceive my &s;elf, might I ever become worthy this

Regard of a Patron, the very Dawn, of who&s;e Life, is breaking out upon the World, with a &s;tronger Lu&s;tre, from his Merit, than it receiv'd, from his State.</P>
<P>I &s;natch'd this Opportunity, to ac|knowledge, my Devotion to your Grace's Name and Family, and to &s;tand out the fir&s;t publick Predictor, that your innate Princely Qualities will ren|der you of more Con&s;equence to your Country, than the &s;plendid Advanta|ges of your Title, and great Power.</P>
<P>So glorious a Conjunction, of hap|py Circum&s;tances, mu&s;t be the Ble&s;&s;ing of your Grace's own Life, the Honour and good Fortune of your Friends and Dependants, and the univer&s;al Admi|ration of the Country, that lays Claim to you: A Country, which, I am &s;ure, you will adorn, by your Coun|cils, and your Actions, after a Man|ner, which has never yet been reach'd,
<PB REF="5">
even by the Brave and Illu&s;trious, long, Line, of your Predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>May the kinde&s;t Care of Heaven pre&s;erve your important Life from all Dangers, and ill Accidents, to be the Ornament of your own Age, and the great Example, and Emulation, of Po&s;terity!</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE are few Men of Learn|ing, (except &s;ome of my own Country, mi&s;led by a Zeal both in|di&s;creet and unwarrantable) who do not readily acknowledge <HI>POE|TRY,</HI> to be the Daughter of Reli|gion, and originally de&s;ign'd, to tune Men's Minds to Devotion. This is evident from the many noble Poems, in the <HI>Old Te&s;tament;</HI> to &s;ay Nothing of other Writings. But the primitive Simplicity, becoming gradually lo&s;t, as the Art was apply'd to Ends, unworthy its In&s;titution, the Reformers were obliged to take Advantage of Mens Pa&s;&s;ions, by giving it a new Turn, which, under the Tempta|tion of Delight, di&s;guis'd the Doctrine they recom|mended. <HI>TRAGEDY,</HI> in particular, was the Per|fection of the <HI>Mu&s;e's</HI> Power. Till <HI>that</HI> became known, there was wanting a kind of Poetry, which, imitating the Actions of Mankind, might work a readier, and more &s;en&s;ible Effect, by a Cor|vection of the Pa&s;&s;ions. The Prevalence of Vice, 'tis true, and Men's natural Propen&s;ity to re&s;i&s;t good In&s;truction, allow'd not a Succe&s;s to <HI>TRAGI|DY,</HI> &s;o univer&s;al, as it merited. But &s;ince no bet|ter Help, than <HI>this,</HI> can be devis'd, the Friends, of Vertue and Genius, mu&s;t u&s;e the means it affords them.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">
In Countries, where <HI>CHRISTIANITY</HI> is receiv'd and e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;ome may, po&s;&s;ibly, imagine, there is, now, no longer Need of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>TRAGE|DY:</HI> But Experience convinces us, That many frequent the <HI>STAGE,</HI> who would hardly be pre|vailed upon, to receive Coun&s;el from the <HI>PULPIT.</HI> The <HI>CLERGY,</HI> therefore, &s;hould con&s;ider, as Aux|iliaries and Fellow-Labourers, tho&s;e <HI>POETS,</HI> who preach Vertue, from the <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> or the <HI>Theatre.</HI> And &s;ince we &s;eek not a Share of <HI>their</HI> Revenues, for the Pains we take, in their Service, they ought, at lea&s;t, in Civility, to allow us their Countenance and Acknowledgement! Is there a Kirkman, among my Adver&s;aries, who&s;e Zeal is &s;o militant, as to fight without Wages? Why, then, am I condemn'd, who, more generou&s;ly, go to War, in a Way, they could not take them&s;elves, were they hindred from fighting again&s;t Vice from the Pulpit! Who is &s;o rude, as to blame an hone&s;t <HI>Volunteer,</HI> in a good Cau&s;e? Or, if one de&s;erves, to be a <HI>Commander in Chief,</HI> Why is he grudged Preferment, beyond the Li&s;t and Rate, of an <HI>Half-Pay-Officer.?</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ome, who are moderate, becau&s;e more wi&s;e, than <HI>tho&s;e</HI> I have had to do with, con|fe&s;s the <HI>STAGE capable</HI> of being made <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> yet condemn it, on Account of the <HI>Abu&s;es</HI> it in|dulges.&mdash;Would they de&s;troy the <HI>Being</HI> of an Art, becau&s;e its U&s;e is corrupted? They argue, like tho&s;e Zealous indeed, but <HI>weak</HI> Reformers, who were for demoli&s;hing Churches, that they might be &s;ure to leave no Images. According
<PB REF="8">
to the&s;e Mens Way of Rea&s;oning, every Thing, that is not perfect, is dangerous and abomina|ble; for there is nothing &s;o excellent, where Abu|&s;es may not enter. <HI>Preaching,</HI> th&ecirc;y know well, is often <HI>abu&s;ed,</HI> will they allow me, therefore, to cry out, That all <HI>Preaching</HI> is <HI>unlawful?</HI></P>
<P>I writ the following &s;hort <HI>TRAGEDY,</HI> to give my Countrymen, of the Kirk, an Example, that &s;ound and u&s;eful In&s;truction may be drawn from the <HI>Theatre,</HI> and that, only, the Abu&s;e is blameable. I might, indeed, have referred my over-rigid Adver&s;aries to other Pieces of <HI>Dramatic POETRY,</HI> already extant: But &s;ome Peculiarities, in my Ca&s;e, (which the World is likely to know more of, very &s;oon,) obliged me, to give a Specimen, my &s;elf, of a Play, wherein nothing, ju&s;tly, can be condemned, by the Rules of Religion and Vertue. I am, therefore, not afraid, to be try'd by good Chri&s;tians; and, I hope, to pa&s;s uncen&s;ured by good Criticks al&s;o, notwith&s;tanding the uncom|mon Manner, in which, I have attempted it.</P>
<P>Five Acts, I know, are Cu&s;tomary: But they can, by no means, be proved nece&s;&s;ary. On the Contrary, if any determinate Number were to be appointed, as a Standard, <HI>Three Acts</HI> &s;eem bet|ter than <HI>Five,</HI> by the Critick's own Rule. A <HI>Be|ginning,</HI> a <HI>Middle,</HI> and an <HI>End,</HI> &s;ay the&s;e Gen|tlemen, are the Stages of the Drama. A fir&s;t Act, then, would open, and prepare, the Matter in|tended. A Second would perfect, and heighten it to its Summit; and the Third, in a ju&s;t, and na|tural De&s;cent, &s;erves to clear up the Embarra&s;|ments,
<PB REF="9">
and bring on the Cata&s;trophe. Thus, may <HI>Three</HI> Acts he defended by <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> better than <HI>Five</HI> from <HI>Cu&s;tom:</HI> But I intend not, hereby to promote the Introduction of a new Manner.</P>
<P>This <HI>Tragedy</HI> was writ &s;o &s;hort, for want of Time to enlarge it, by Addition of other Charac|ters, and Epi&s;odical Incidents; yet, becau&s;e I would not be &s;ubject to the Reproaches of mi&s;ta|ken Petulance, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that if a <HI>dramatic</HI> Story is compleat, in its <HI>Prepa|ration, Progre&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Conclu&s;ion,</HI> it is of no great Importance, what Number of Acts it con|&s;i&s;ts of.</P>
<P>But one general Error, if I mi&s;take not, among Writers of <HI>TRAGEDY,</HI> is a Failure in their very <HI>Principle.</HI> They teach not a <HI>Moral,</HI> but de|&s;cribe &s;ome Piece of <HI>Hi&s;tory.&mdash;</HI>The Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>STAGE,</HI> if I apprehend it rightly, is, fir&s;t, to intend &s;ome general and u&s;eful <HI>In&s;truction,</HI> how Men may avoid certain Mi&s;chiefs in Life, by cor|recting tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, which mu&s;t naturally pro|duce them; and then, to find, or invent, &s;ome <HI>Story,</HI> which may &s;erve as an <HI>Example,</HI> for &s;trengthening that <HI>Precept,</HI> and &s;hew a Man made mi&s;erable by Effect of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, which the Writer would teach his Audience to re&s;i&s;t, or keep Guard again&s;t. Every Thing, in a <HI>Trage|dy,</HI> which has not a direct, and vi&s;ible, Tendency to the Moral it is writ for, is &s;uperfluous, and mon&s;trous; and, however pompou&s;ly embelli&s;hed, &s;erves for nothing, but to weaken the In&s;truction,
<PB REF="10">
and di&s;tract the Attention, and Apprehen&s;ion, of an Audience.</P>
<P>I took the Hint (and only the Hint, as the Reader may &s;ee) of that Story, which I have fitted to the Moral of the following little Piece, from <HI>SHAKESPEAR'S York&s;hire Tragedy,</HI> which was put into my Hands, on purpo&s;e, by my good Friend, Mr. <HI>Hill,</HI> to whom I take this Occa&s;ion of expre&s;&s;ing my Gratitude, in the mo&s;t publick manner I can; all Endeavours, be&s;ide Acknow|ledgments, being vain, to match the In&s;tances of his Friend&s;hip, and that uncommon Humanity, and Frankne&s;s of Spirit, &s;o peculiar to him&s;elf, in his manner of be&s;towing Favours: But 'tis needle&s;s, to tell the World, how much I am oblig'd to him, and what ju&s;t Sen&s;e I have of his gene|rous Regard to me. They, who know him well, and what a Wa&s;te of his important Time he has made for my Intere&s;t, will be beforehand with my Acknowledgements, and enumerate the Advanta|ges, which I could not mi&s;s from his Friend&s;hip.&mdash;I owe much, in the Scheme, in the Sentiments, and Language, of this Piece, to the Direction of that accompli&s;hed Gentleman, who, has either no E|nemies, or they are &s;uch, becau&s;e Strangers to his good Qualities; for, 'tis only nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>know</HI> him, to be, by Choice, or Obligation, made invio|lably his own.&mdash;I embrace this Opportunity of thanking him for his excellent Prologue, which &s;o well prepared the Audience for the Repre&s;enta|tion. Nor can I help thanking him even for the Epilogue, tho' not le&s;s plea&s;ant on my &s;elf, than
<PB REF="11">
on my Adver&s;aries among the <HI>Scots</HI> Clergy; for who would not be contented under a Stroke, or two, of his Satyr, who&s;e <HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> (as <HI>Juba</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Cato)</HI> I would rather have, than Worlds for my Admirers.</P>
<P>Before I end this Preface, I mu&s;t not forget to thank the Genero&s;ity of my Friends, of all Qua|lities, who, &s;o nobly, grac'd the Action of my fir&s;t Endeavour, in <HI>TRAGEDY.</HI> I &s;hould have very little Merit, not to improve on &s;uch Encou|ragement.&mdash;Before &s;o &s;elect, and illu&s;trious an Audience, the admirable Mrs. <HI>Seymour,</HI> and the Gentlemen, who &s;o well performed the Parts, mu&s;t have felt a Satisfaction, equal to that Ap|plau&s;e, which their Action de&s;erved, and met with.</P>
