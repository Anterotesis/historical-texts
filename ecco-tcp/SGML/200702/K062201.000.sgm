<P>LETTERS Written TO and FOR PARTICULAR FRIENDS, On the mo&s;t IMPORTANT OCCASIONS. Directing not only the Requi&s;ite STYLE <HI>and</HI> FORMS To be Ob&s;erved in WRITING Familiar Letters; But How to THINK and ACT <HI>Ju&s;tly</HI> and <HI>Prudently,</HI> IN THE COMMON CONCERNS OF HUMAN LIFE.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following Letters are pub|li&s;h'd at the Solicitation of par|ticular Friends, who are of Opi|nion, that they will an&s;wer &s;eve|ral good Ends, as they may not only direct the <HI>Forms</HI> requi&s;ite to be ob&s;erved on the mo&s;t important Occa&s;ions; but, what is more to the Purpo&s;e, by the Rules and In&s;tructions contained in them, contri|bute to <HI>mend the Heart,</HI> and <HI>improve the Under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>NATURE, PROPRIETY of CHARACTER, PLAIN SENSE, and GENERAL USE, have been the chief Objects of the Author's Attention in the penning of the&s;e Letters; and as he every-where aimed to write to the <HI>Judgment,</HI> rather than to the <HI>Imagination,</HI> he would chu&s;e, that they &s;hould generally be found more <HI>u&s;eful</HI>
<PB REF="3">
than <HI>diverting:</HI> Tho', where the Subjects require <HI>Strokes of Humour,</HI> and <HI>innocent Raillery,</HI> it will be &s;een, perhaps, that the Method he has taken, was the Effect of <HI>Choice,</HI> and not merely of <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity.</HI></P>
<P>The Writer is no Friend to long Pre|faces; but it may be nece&s;&s;ary, however, to &s;ay, what he has <HI>aimed at</HI> in this Per|formance; and to leave his <HI>Merit</HI> in the <HI>Execution</HI> of it, to proper Judges.</P>
<P>He has endeavour'd then, in general, throughout the great Variety of his Sub|jects, to inculcate the Principles of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Benevolence;</HI> to de&s;cribe <HI>properly,</HI> and recommend <HI>&s;trongly,</HI> the SOCIAL and RELATIVE DUTIES; and to place them in &s;uch <HI>practical</HI> Lights, that the Letters may &s;erve for Rules to THINK and ACT by, as well as Forms to WRITE after.</P>
<P>Particularly, he has endeavoured to point out the Duty of a <HI>Servant,</HI> not a <HI>Slave;</HI> the Duty of a <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> not a <HI>Ty|rant;</HI> that of the <HI>Parent,</HI> not as a Per&s;on moro&s;e and &s;our, and hard to be plea&s;ed; but mild, indulgent, kind, and &s;uch an one as would rather govern by <HI>Per&s;ua&s;ion</HI> than <HI>Force.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="4">
He has endeavour'd to direct the young Man in the Choice of his <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Companions;</HI> to excite him to <HI>Dili|gence;</HI> to di&s;courage <HI>Extravagance, Sotti&s;hne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Vice</HI> of all Kinds.</P>
<P>He has aimed to &s;et forth, in a Variety of Ca&s;es, to <HI>both Sexes,</HI> the Inconve|niencies attending <HI>un&s;uitable Marriages;</HI> to expo&s;e the Folly of a <HI>litigious Spirit;</HI> to con&s;ole the <HI>Unhappy;</HI> to comfort the <HI>Mourner:</HI> And many of the&s;e by Argu|ments, tho' <HI>ea&s;y</HI> and <HI>familiar,</HI> yet <HI>new</HI> and <HI>uncommon.</HI></P>
<P>With regard to the Letters of <HI>Court|&s;hip,</HI> the Author has aimed to point out &s;uch Methods of Addre&s;s, to a young Man, as may &s;tand the Te&s;t of the <HI>Parents Judgment,</HI> as well as the <HI>Daughter's Opinion;</HI> and, at the &s;ame time, that they &s;hould not want the proper Warmth of Expre&s;&s;ion, which Complai&s;ance, and Pa&s;|&s;ion for the beloved Object, in&s;pire, (and is &s;o much expected in Addre&s;&s;es of this Na|ture) they &s;hould have their Foundation laid in <HI>common Sen&s;e,</HI> and a <HI>manly Sin|cerity;</HI> and, in a Word, be &s;uch as a <HI>prudent Woman</HI> need not blu&s;h to receive, nor a <HI>di&s;creet Man</HI> be a&s;hamed to look
<PB REF="5">
back upon, when the <HI>doubtful Court&s;hip</HI> is changed into the <HI>matrimonial Certainty.</HI></P>
<P>With this View he has al&s;o attempted to expo&s;e the <HI>empty Flou i&s;hes,</HI> and <HI>inco|herent Rhap&s;odies,</HI> by which <HI>&s;hallow Heads,</HI> and <HI>de&s;igning Hearts,</HI> endeavour to exalt their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es into <HI>Godde&s;&s;es,</HI> in hopes of having it in their Power to &s;ink them into the Characters of the <HI>mo&s;t Cre|dulous</HI> and <HI>Fooli&s;h</HI> of their Sex.</P>
<P><HI>Orphans,</HI> and <HI>Ladies</HI> of <HI>independent Fortunes,</HI> he has particularly endeavour'd to guard again&s;t the in&s;idious Arts of their <HI>flattering</HI> and <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> Dependents, and the <HI>clande&s;tine</HI> Addre&s;&s;es of <HI>Fortune-hunters,</HI> tho&s;e Bea&s;ts of Prey, as they may well be called, who &s;pread their <HI>Snares</HI> for the <HI>innocent</HI> and <HI>thoughtle&s;s</HI> Heart.</P>
<P>The&s;e, among other no le&s;s material Objects, have been the Author's principal <HI>Aim:</HI> How well he has <HI>&s;ucceeded,</HI> mu&s;t, as has been hinted, be left to the Judg|ment of the candid Reader.</P>

<LETTER N="1">
<HEAD>LETTER I. To a Father, again&s;t putting a Youth of but moderate Parts to a Profe&s;&s;ion that requires more exten&s;ive Abilities.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_YOU pay me a Compliment, tho' a very obliging one, when in the la&s;t Letter you favoured me with, you de&s;ire my Advice, with re&s;pect to the Di&s;po&s;ition of your Son <HI>William;</HI> whom you are inclin'd to bring up to the Bar. If, in complying with your Reque&s;t, I &s;hould &s;ay any thing you may not intirely approve, you will not have &s;o much room to
<PB N="2" REF="17">
blame me, as your own wrong Choice of a Coun&s;ellor.</P>
<P>I need not now tell you, I have a good Opi|nion of <HI>Will;</HI> and think him a mode&s;t, grave, &s;ober, Youth: But, for this very Rea&s;on, I hardly think him qualified for the Profe&s;&s;ion you would chu&s;e for him; for, I doubt, he has neither Talents for the Law, nor ever will have the Pre&s;ence of Mind nece&s;&s;ary to make a Figure at the Bar. In any &s;mooth, ea&s;y Bu&s;ine&s;s, he will probably &s;ucceed, and be a u&s;eful Member of the Commonwealth. And as he is not your elde&s;t Son, I &s;hould, were it to me, put him to a Merchant; or, as we live in an I&s;land, and Trade and Navigation are both our Riches and our Glory, I &s;hould not even &s;cruple to put a <HI>&s;econd</HI> Son to a creditable whole&s;ale Dealer, rather than fail; if he him&s;elf is not aver&s;e to &s;uch a Calling. For I know not (you'll excu&s;e me, I'm &s;ure) whether <HI>Will</HI>'s Genius is equal to that of an univer&s;al Merchant: For, the various Springs of Com|merce, the Sea&s;ons for chu&s;ing proper Commo|dities, and numberle&s;s Incidents that make a nece&s;&s;ary Return of Gain precarious, are full Im|ployment for the &s;tronge&s;t Judgment; as a Man, by one ill-cho&s;en Venture, often lo&s;es more than he gains by &s;everal &s;ucce&s;sful ones.</P>
<P>But this Opinion of <HI>Will,</HI> &s;hould you think it ju&s;t, will be no Ob&s;tacle to his &s;ucceeding in the World in &s;ome creditable ea&s;y Bu&s;ine&s;s. Tho' I think him unequal to the Part you &s;eem inclinable to allot him; yet he is no Fool: And Experience teaches us, that, in &s;ome &s;orts of Bu&s;ine&s;s, ample Advantage, may be made by very moderate Ta|lents, with much Reputation. The&s;e are princi|pally &s;uch Employments as merely con&s;i&s;t in Buy|ng with Prudence, and in Selling at a Market-profit:
<PB N="3" REF="18">
Hence we &s;ee &s;everal Whole&s;ale Dealers gain large Fortunes with Ea&s;e and Credit, and without any other Secret than the plain Practice of Buying at the be&s;t Hand, paying for their Goods punctually, and vending them always <HI>for what they are.</HI> In Dealings of this Kind, the Fatigues are few, and clear well-kept Books are &s;ufficient to &s;hew, at any time, a Man's Lo&s;s or Gain; for which, generally &s;peaking, le&s;s than One Forenoon in a Week is &s;ufficient: And yet, by a con&s;tant Attention, in this ea&s;y manner, as <HI>good</HI> a Character, and, very often, <HI>more</HI> Money is to be gained than in Profe&s;&s;ions that require an extraordinary Genius, a perpetual Attention, and a clo&s;e and inten&s;e Study; which very &s;eldom &s;uc|ceeds neither: For &s;ee you not of Hundreds of Lawyers, how very few of them make a Figure, or get genteel Bread? And how many, for want of Courage to appear at the Bar (who yet have good Parts and Knowledge in the Laws) are forced to confine them&s;elves to Chamber-practice, in which it is a long time before they grow noted enough to make a tolerable Livelihood.</P>
<P>As to what you hint, of placing him in the Phy&s;ick Tribe; I like this no better than the other. Con&s;ider only this one Thing, how long it is be|fore he will be capable of entering into Bu&s;ine&s;s, or Reputation, as a Phy&s;ician, if he ever does it at all: For who chu&s;es to tru&s;t his Health to a raw and unexperienced young Man? The Law requires a &s;prightly Impudence, if I may &s;o &s;ay, the Phy&s;ick Line a &s;olemn one, in the Per&s;on who would make a Figure in either. And do you think, tho' <HI>Will</HI> is grave enough of Con&s;cience, that he ever can come up to that important Deportment, that unblu&s;hing Parade, which is the very E&s;&s;ence of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Phy&s;ician? So he may, in either of the Pro|&s;e&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="4" REF="19">
live over all his Days, and be quite un|known; for, as <HI>Practice</HI> in both Faculties is the be&s;t Teacher, and <HI>Theory</HI> a mo&s;t uncertain Guide, he may live to be Forty of Fifty Years of Age, and not come into any Bu&s;ine&s;s that &s;hall improve him&s;elf, or benefit his Con&s;ulters.</P>
<P>Whereas in the Way I propo&s;e, no &s;ooner is he come of Age, and fit to be tru&s;ted with the Management of any Affairs at all, but his Seven Years will be expired; and if he has not been wanting to him&s;elf in it (and if he be, he would have been much more &s;o in an ab&s;tru&s;er Bu&s;ine&s;s) he will be enabled, with the Fortune you can be&s;tow upon him, to enter upon the Stage of the World with great Advantage, and become <HI>directly,</HI> a nece&s;&s;ary and an u&s;eful Member of the Commu|nity. And, my good Friend, when you and I recollect, that mo&s;t of the noble Families in the Kingdom, as well as the genteel ones, had the Foundations of their Grandeur laid in Trade, I expect not, in &s;uch a Country as ours e&s;pecially, that any Objection to my Advice will be form'd, either by you or your good Lady, on this Score, if you have not more &s;ignificant Rea&s;ons proceed|ing from the Boy's Turn of Mind and Inclination; which, I think, &s;hould always be con&s;ulted on the&s;e Occa&s;ions. For, tho' I hope it never will be &s;o in your Ca&s;e, yet nothing has been more common, than that of Two Sons, the Elde&s;t brought up to the E&s;tate, the other to Trade, in the Revolution of Twenty or Thirty Years, the latter, thro' the Extravagance of the former, has made him&s;elf <HI>Elde&s;t,</HI> as I may &s;ay; for, by &s;aving while the other has been &s;pending, he has found Means to keep the E&s;tate in the Family, tho' it has been transferr'd upon the <HI>younge&s;t,</HI> and, as it has then proved, the <HI>worthie&s;t</HI> Branch.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="20">
This, I think, de&s;erves your Con&s;ideration; and by viewing <HI>Will</HI> in the &s;ame Light I do; that of a well-inclined Lad, of moderate Pa&s;&s;ions, great natural Mode&s;ty, and no &s;oaring Genius; I believe you will think it be&s;t to di&s;po&s;e of him in &s;uch manner as may require no greater Talents than he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and may, in due Time, make him appear in the Face of the World fully quali|fied for what he undertakes. I am, Sir,</P>

<LETTER N="2">
<HEAD>LETTER II. From an UNCLE to a NEPHEW, on his keep|ing bad Company, bad Hours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in his Apprentice&s;hip.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Nephew,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very much concerned to hear that you are of late fallen into bad Company; that you keep bad Hours, and give great Unea&s;ine&s;s to your Ma&s;ter, and break the Rules of his Family: That when he expo&s;tulates with you on this Occa&s;ion, you return pert and bold An&s;wers; and, in&s;tead of promi&s;ing or endeavouring to amend, repeat the Offence; and have enter'd into Clubs and Societies of young Fellows, who &s;et at naught all good Example, and make &s;uch Per&s;ons who would do their Duty, the Subject of their Ridicule, as Per|&s;ons of narrow Minds, and who want the Courage to do as they do.</P>
<P>Let me, on this Occa&s;ion, expo&s;tulate with you, and &s;et before you the Evil of the Way you are in.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="21">
In the fir&s;t Place: What can you mean by breaking the Rules of a Family you had bound your &s;elf by Contract to ob&s;erve? Do you think it is <HI>hone&s;t,</HI> to break thro' Engagements into which you have &s;o &s;olemnly entered; and which are no le&s;s the Rules of the Corporation you are to be one Day free of, than tho&s;e of a private Family?&mdash;Seven Years, &s;everal of which are elap&s;ed, are not &s;o long a Term, but that you may &s;ee it determined before you are over-fit to betru&s;ted with your own Conduct: Twenty-one or Twenty-two Years of Age, is full early for a young Man to be his own Ma&s;ter, whatever you may think; and you may &s;urely &s;tay till <HI>then,</HI> at lea&s;t, to chu&s;e your own Hours, and your own Company; and, I fear, as you go on, if you do not mend your Ways, your Di&s;cretion will not <HI>then</HI> do Credit to your Choice. Remember, you have no Time you can call your own, during the Continuance of your Contract; and mu&s;t you abu&s;e your Ma&s;ter in a double Sen&s;e; rob him of his Time, e&s;pecially if any of it be Hours of Bu&s;ine&s;s; rob him of his Re&s;t; break the Peace of his Family, and give a bad Example to others? And all for what? Why to riot in the Company of a Set of Per&s;ons, who contemn, as they teach you to do, all Order and Di&s;cipline; who, in all Likelihood, will lead you into into Gaming, Drinking, Swearing, and even more dangerous Vices, to the unhinging of your Mind from your Bu&s;ine&s;s, which mu&s;t be your future Support.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, I exhort you, in time, to what the&s;e Cour&s;es may lead you. Con&s;ider the Affiction you will give to all your Friends, by your Con|tinuance in them. Lay together the Sub&s;tance of the Conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;es in a whole Evening, with your frothy Companions, after you are come
<PB N="7" REF="22">
from them, and reflect what &s;olid Truth, what u&s;eful Le&s;&s;on, worthy of being inculcated in your future Life, that whole Evening has afforded you; and con&s;ider, whether it is worth breaking thro' all Rule and Order for?&mdash;Whether your pre|&s;ent Conduct is &s;uch as you would allow in a Ser|vant of your own? Whether you are &s;o capable to pur&s;ue your Bu&s;ine&s;s with that Ardor and De|light next Morning, as if you had not drank, or kept bad Hours over Night? If not, whether your Ma&s;ter has not a double Lo&s;s and Damage from your mi&s;-&s;pent Evenings? Whether the taking of &s;mall Liberties, as you may think them, leads you not on to greater; for, let me tell you, you will not find it in your Power to &s;top when you will: And then, whether any Re&s;traint at all will not in time be irk&s;ome to you?</P>
<P>I have gone thro' the like Servitude with Plea|&s;ure and Credit. I found my&s;elf my own Ma&s;ter full &s;oon for my Di&s;cretion: What you think of your &s;elf I know not; but I wi&s;h you may do as well for your own Intere&s;t, and Reputation too, as I have done for mine: And I'll a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hould not have thought it either creditable or <HI>hone&s;t</HI> to do as you do. I could have &s;tood the Laugh of an Hundred &s;uch vain Companions as you chu&s;e, for being too narrow-minded to break thro' all moral Obligations to my Ma&s;ter, in order to &s;hew the Bravery of a bad Heart, and what an abandon'd Mind dared to perpetrate. A bad Be|ginning &s;eldom makes a good Ending, and if you was a&s;&s;ured that you could &s;top when you came for your &s;elf, which is very improbable, how will you an&s;wer it to Equity and good Con&s;cience, that you will not do &s;o for your Ma&s;ter? There is, let me tell you, more true Bravery of Mind in for|bearing to do an Injury, than in giving Offence.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="23">
You are now at an Age, when you &s;hould &s;tudy to <HI>improve</HI> not <HI>divert</HI> your Faculties. You &s;hould now lay in a Fund of Knowledge, that in time, when ripened by Experience, may make you a worthy Member of the Commonwealth. Do you think you have nothing to learn, either as to your Bu&s;ine&s;s, or as to the forming of your Mind? Would it not be much better to chu&s;e the &s;ilent, the &s;ober Conver&s;ation of BOOKS, than of &s;uch Companions as never read or think? An Author never commits any but his be&s;t Thoughts to Paper; but what can you expect from the laughing noi&s;y Company you keep, but frothy Prate, indige&s;ted Notions, and Thoughts &s;o unwor|thy of being remember'd, that it is the greate&s;t Kindne&s;s to forget them.</P>
<P>Let me intreat you then, my dear Kin&s;man, for your Family's &s;ake, for your own &s;ake, before it be too late, to reflect as you ought upon the Cour&s;e you are enter'd into. By applying your&s;elf to Books, in&s;tead of &s;uch vain Company, you will be quali|fied in time for the be&s;t of Company, and to be re&s;pected by all Ranks of Men. This will keep you out of unnece&s;&s;ary Expences, will employ all your lei&s;ure Time, will exclude a world of Temptations, and open and inlarge your Notions of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n and Things, and, finally, &s;et you above that wretched Company which now you &s;eem &s;o much delighted with. And one Thing let me recommend to you, That you keep a Li&s;t of the young Men of your Standing within the Com|pa&s;s of your Knowledge, and for the next Seven Years ob&s;erve what Fate will attend them: See, if tho&s;e who follow <HI>not</HI> the Cour&s;e you are &s;o lately enter'd into, will not appear in a very dif|ferent Light from tho&s;e who <HI>do;</HI> and from the Indu&s;try and Pro&s;perity of the one, and the

Decay or Failure of the other, (if their vain Ways do not bla&s;t them before, or as &s;oon as they begin the World) you'll find abundant Rea&s;on every Day to ju&s;tify the Truth of the Ob&s;ervations I have thrown together. As nothing but my Af|fection for you could po&s;&s;ibly influence me to the&s;e Expo&s;tulations, I hope for a proper Effect from them, if you would be thought well of by, or ex|pect any Favour from,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear <HI>Billy,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very &s;orry to hear of the Difference between your Ma&s;ter and you. I was always afraid you would expect the &s;ame Indulgences you had met with at home; and as you know, that in many In&s;tances, I have endeavoured to make any &s;eem|ing Hard&s;hip as ea&s;y to you as I could, if this cau&s;es you to be harder to be &s;atisfied, it would be a great Trouble to me. Your Uncle tells me, I am afraid with too much Truth, that the Indul|gences you have received from me, have made your pre&s;ent Station more di&s;agreeable than it would otherwi&s;e have been. What I have always done for you was intended for your Good, and nothing could &s;o deeply afflict me as to &s;ee my Tenderne&s;s

have a contrary Effect: Therefore, dear Child, to my con&s;tant Care for your Welfare, do not add the Sorrow of &s;eeing it the Cau&s;e of your behaving wor&s;e than if it had not been be&s;tow'd upon you; for as, before we put you to your Ma&s;ter, we had an extraordinary Character of him, from all his Neighbours, and tho&s;e who dealt with him; and as Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> who is now out of his Time, gives him the be&s;t of Characters, and declares your Mi&s;tre&s;s to be a Woman of great Prudence and good Conduct; I know not how to think they would u&s;e you ill in any re&s;pect. But con|&s;ider, my Dear, you mu&s;t not, in any Woman be&s;ide my&s;elf, expect to find a fond, and perhaps partial Mother; for, the little Failings which I could not &s;ee in you, will appear very plain to other Per&s;ons. My Love for you would make me wi&s;h you always with me; but as that is what your future Welfare will no way permit; and as you mu&s;t certainly be a Gainer by the Situation you are now in, let a De&s;ire to promote <HI>my</HI> Happine&s;s, as well as <HI>your own,</HI> make every &s;eeming Difficulty light; which, I hope, will appear much lighter for being what I intreat you to di&s;pen&s;e with; who am,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Cou&s;in <HI>William,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry you &s;hould have any Mi&s;under&s;tand|ing with your Ma&s;ter: I have a good Opinion of him, and am unwilling to entertain a bad one of you. It is &s;o much a Ma&s;ter's Intere&s;t to u&s;e his Apprentices well, that I am inclinable to think that when they are badly treated, it is oftener the Effect of Provocation than Choice. Wherefore, before I give my&s;elf the Trouble of interpo&s;ing in your Behalf, I de&s;ire you will &s;trictly inquire of your|&s;elf, whether you have not, by &s;ome Mi&s;conduct or other, provoked that Alteration in your Ma&s;ter's Be|haviour of which you &s;o much complain. If, after having diligently complied with this Reque&s;t, you a&s;&s;ure me that you are not &s;en&s;ible of having given Cau&s;e of Di&s;gu&s;t on your Side, I will readily u&s;e my be&s;t Endeavours to reconcile you to your Ma&s;ter, or procure you another. But if you find your&s;elf blame|ble, it will be better for you to remove, by your own Amendment, the Occa&s;ion of your Ma&s;ter's Di&s;|plea&s;ure, than to have me, or any other Friend, offer to plead your Excu&s;e, where you know it would be unju&s;t to defend you. If this &s;hould be your Ca&s;e, all your Friends together could promi&s;e your better Behaviour, indeed; but as the Performance mu&s;t even then be your own, it will add much more to your Character to pa&s;s thro' your whole Term without any Interpo&s;ition between you.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear <HI>Robin,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you are now entering into the World, and will probably have con&s;iderable Dealings in your Bu&s;ine&s;s, the frequent Occa&s;ions you will have for Advice from others, will make you de|&s;irous
<PB N="14" REF="29">
of &s;ingling out among your mo&s;t intimate Acquaintance, one or two, whom you would view in the Light of Friends.</P>
<P>In the Choice of the&s;e, your utmo&s;t Care and Caution will be nece&s;&s;ary: for, by a Mi&s;take here, you can &s;carcely conceive the fatal Effects you may hereafter experience: Wherefore, it will be proper for you to make a Judgment of tho&s;e who are fit to be your Advi&s;ers, by the Conduct they have ob&s;erved in <HI>their own</HI> Affairs, and the <HI>Reputation</HI> they bear in the World. For he who has by his own Indi&s;cretions undone him&s;elf, is much fitter to be &s;et up as a Land-mark for a pru|dent Mariner to &s;hun his Cour&s;es, than an Example to follow.</P>
<P>Old Age is generally &s;low and heavy, Youth head&s;trong and precipitate; but there are old Men who are full of Vivacity, and young Men reple|ni&s;h'd with Di&s;cretion; which makes me rather point out the <HI>Conduct</HI> than the <HI>Age</HI> of the Per&s;ons with whom you &s;hould chu&s;e to a&s;&s;ociate; tho' after all, it is a never-failing good Sign to me of Prudence and Virtue in a young Man, when his Seniors chu&s;e his Company, and he delights in theirs.</P>
<P>Let your Endeavour therefore be, at all Adven|tures, to con&s;ort your&s;elf with Men of Sobriety, good Sen&s;e and Virtue; for the Proverb is an un|erring one, that &s;ays, <HI>A Man is known by the Com|pany he keeps.</HI> If &s;uch Men you can &s;ingle out, while you improve by their Conver&s;ation, you will benefit by their Advice; and be &s;ure remember one thing, that tho' you mu&s;t be frank and unre&s;erved in delivering your Sentiments, when Occa&s;ions offer, yet that you be much readier to <HI>hear</HI> than <HI>&s;peak;</HI> for to this Purpo&s;e it has been &s;ignificantly ob&s;erved, that Nature has given a Man <HI>two</HI> Ears,
<PB N="15" REF="30">
and but <HI>one</HI> Tongue. Lay in therefore by Ob&s;er|vation, and a mode&s;t Silence, &s;uch a Store of Ideas, that you may at their Time of Life, make no wor&s;e Figure than they do; and endeavour to bene|fit your&s;elf rather by other Peoples Ills than your own. How mu&s;t tho&s;e young Men expo&s;e them|&s;elves to the Contempt and Ridicule of their Seniors, who having &s;een little or nothing of the World, are continually &s;hutting out by <HI>open Mouths</HI> and <HI>clo&s;ed Ears,</HI> all Po&s;&s;ibility of In&s;truction, and making vain the principal End of Conver&s;ation, which is Improvement. A &s;ilent young Man makes generally a wi&s;e old one, and never fails of being re&s;pected by the be&s;t and mo&s;t prudent Men. When therefore you come among Strangers, hear every one &s;peak before you deliver your own Sen|timents; by this means you will judge of the Merit and Capacities of your Company, and avoid expo&s;ing your&s;elf, as I have known many do, by &s;hooting out ha&s;ty and incon&s;iderate Bolts, which they would have been glad to recal, when perhaps a &s;ilent Genius in Company has bur&s;t out upon them with &s;uch Ob&s;ervations, as have &s;truck Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and Shame in the forward Speaker, if he has not been quite in&s;en&s;ible of inward Reproach.</P>
<P>I have thrown together, as they occurr'd, a few Thoughts, which may &s;uffice for the pre&s;ent to &s;hew my Care and Concern for your Welfare. I hope you will con&s;tantly from time to time, com|municate to me whatever you &s;hall think worthy of my Notice, or in which my Advice may be of U&s;e to you. For I have no Plea&s;ure in this Life equal to that which the Happine&s;s of my Children gives me. And of this you may be a&s;&s;ured; for I am, and ever mu&s;t be,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. General Rules for agreeable Conver&s;ation in a young Man. From a Father to a Son.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear <HI>William,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I had not an Opportunity of &s;aying &s;o much to you as I wi&s;hed when you were la&s;t here; I &s;end this to inform you of &s;ome things in your general Conver&s;ation, which I think would be proper for you to ob&s;erve, and amend; particularly <HI>your exce&s;&s;ive Itch for Talking,</HI> which di&s;covers it&s;elf alike on all Occa&s;ions. I have always flatter'd my|&s;elf that you do not want Sen&s;e, and am willing to hope I have not been deceived: But the dangerous Self-&s;ufficiency of mo&s;t young Men, &s;eems violently to have &s;eized you, which, I hope, a little Re|flection will remove.</P>
<P>The Art of rendering your&s;elf agreeable in Con|ver&s;ation is worth your &s;erious Study: 'Tis an Ad|vantage few can boa&s;t, tho' &s;ought after by all; and nothing is &s;o con&s;tant an Enemy to Succe&s;s in tho&s;e who would excel in this Art, as the harbour|ing an Opinion of their own Proficiency, before they have attained to any tolerable Degree of Knowledge in what they imagine them&s;elves po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of. Conver&s;ation, where it is rightly ma|naged, mu&s;t be &s;o conducted, as to let each Mem|ber of the Company have a Share in the <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Applau&s;e</HI> it affords: If you are Six in Number, after you have told a Story, or made any Remark which gives a general Satisfaction; you mu&s;t con|&s;ider it the Right of another to call <HI>your</HI> Attention in his Turn; and, unle&s;s particularly reque&s;ted, it betrays a great Weakne&s;s to <HI>follow your&s;elf.</HI> No doubt but you love to be admired: And have not
<PB N="17" REF="32">
others the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion? You believe your Wit more brilliant than theirs? Are you &s;ure that they are not of the &s;ame Opinion as to their own? If a Man &s;peaks little, you mu&s;t not from thence con|clude him willing to give up every Claim to con|ver&s;ible Merit: Perhaps he cannot &s;ing: But to be &s;ure he is as de&s;irous of having his <HI>peculiar Humour,</HI> or his <HI>dry Joke</HI> applauded, as you are to be intreat|ed another Song. If he is no Mathematician, per|haps he is ver&s;ed in religious Di&s;putation; if he de&s;pi&s;es Plays, he may admire Hi&s;tory; tho' he under&s;tands not Geography, he may yet know how to de&s;cribe the Humours of Mankind: And tho' he pretends not to Politicks, he may have a Turn for &s;ome more u&s;eful Science. When the&s;e are con&s;idered, if his Mode&s;ty is great, you cannot ob|lige him more than by throwing an Opportunity in his way to di&s;play his Capacity on the Subject he believes him&s;elf mo&s;t able to handle with Ad|vantage: For, in order to &s;upport a thorough good Humour, a Man mu&s;t be plea&s;ed with <HI>him|&s;elf</HI> as well as with <HI>others.</HI> When this is pro|perly taken Care of, Conver&s;ation &s;eldom fails to prove entertaining: And to the Neglect of this, are owing many of the <HI>yawning</HI> Hours &s;pent in Companies compo&s;ed of Men not incapable of be|having agreeably.</P>
<P>The Manner of telling a Story, is al&s;o worth your Notice: You have known the Plea&s;ure of hearing a long one well told: Mr. <HI>Trotter</HI> has an admirable Talent in this way: But then you mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that half the Plea&s;ure he gives, ari&s;es from his happily avoiding any of the &s;illy Digre&s;&s;ions, which are the great Cau&s;e of a Story's &s;eeming tedious: You never hear him mingle his Relation with, <HI>I remember very well it was the &s;ame Day that 'Squire</HI> Trumbul's <HI>Son came of Age.&mdash;I bought</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="33">
<HI>my bay Nag the very Day before, at &s;uch a Fair, being a</HI> Friday <HI>that Year;&mdash;or, I can &s;carce think of it without Laughing;&mdash;But, however, as I was &s;aying:</HI>&mdash;And a hundred more &s;uch Dead-weights to Attention. Nor does he ever prai&s;e a Story be|fore he relates it; a fatal Rock to many a good Relation: For when any Story wants a preparatory Recommendation, it ought not to be told; and even when the Relation is po&s;&s;ible, the Generality of Auditors are apt to per&s;uade them&s;elves,<Q><HI>The Mountain labours, and a Mou&s;e is born.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are loo&s;e and general Hints; but by a due Improvement of them, you will find your&s;elf very &s;en&s;ibly grow more and more agreeable where-ever you conver&s;e. An Ea&s;e and becoming Freedom you already have, and by the Addition of Di&s;cre|tion in your U&s;e of them, and Complai&s;ance to others, you will probably &s;ucceed in the De&s;ire &s;o predominant in you, of being admired by Men of Sen&s;e and Judgment.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM more concerned for your Welfare than you imagine. You are younger than my&s;elf: My Duty, in &s;ome Degree, requires my Care for your Good, and particularly in a Point that may
<PB N="19" REF="34">
be &s;o material to your whole Life, as is that of Love.</P>
<P>Beauty has as great a Force upon my Sen&s;es, as it can have upon yours. I am near Thirty Years of Age; you are not more than Twenty. Your Pa&s;&s;ions are &s;trong; mine, Brother, are far from &s;ub&s;iding: I admire, I love, with as much Force of Nature as you can do. My Rea&s;on ought to be &s;tronger, and 'tis well if my Pa&s;&s;ion is not &s;o likewi&s;e. Mi&s;s <HI>Rooke</HI> is amiable on many Ac|counts; her Features are regular, her Wit &s;prightly, her Deportment genteel; and Voice,&mdash;I had al|mo&s;t &s;aid, ravi&s;hing. Her Dre&s;s is ea&s;y and un|affected; and her Manner of Conver&s;ation, has a Freedom that captivates more Hearts, than yours: Yet, I greatly fear, with all the&s;e Endow|ments, &s;he will not make the Wife you ought to wi&s;h for. Her airy Flights, and gay Behaviour, are plea&s;ing, as a Partner in Conver&s;ation, but will they be equally agreeable in a Partner <HI>for Life?</HI> What now charms <HI>you,</HI> charms al&s;o <HI>others:</HI> You are now content with thinking your&s;elf <HI>one</HI> among <HI>many</HI> that admire her, and are admitted to <HI>&s;hare</HI> the Brilliancy of her Conver&s;ation; but will a <HI>Share</HI> of her Wit and Humour, her Freedom and Gaiety, plea&s;e hereafter as a Wife? And tho' &s;he is delight|ful in Company, are you &s;atisfied &s;he will be as agreeable when alone with you; or when &s;he has not an Opportunity of &s;hewing-away in a Company that perhaps you may not approve? She now &s;ees nobody but whom &s;he chu&s;es to &s;ee: If &s;he &s;hould be a Wife, it is more than probable &s;he may di&s;like Re&s;traints: and can you approve of a diffu&s;e Conver&s;ation in one you de&s;ire to your|&s;elf?</P>
<P>Think not, Brother, that I have any intere&s;ted Motive for this Advice. I a&s;&s;ure you I have not.
<PB N="20" REF="35">
I am not your Rival: I de&s;ire not the Lady you &s;eem too fond of. All I mean (for I &s;ay nothing at pre&s;ent, with regard to your own Youth, which ought not, however, to be wholly forgotten, as very few prudent Matches are made by young Gentle|men at your Age) is, to caution you again&s;t thinking of a Gentlewoman who <HI>may,</HI> and I am willing to believe <HI>will,</HI> be a &s;uitable Companion to a Gentleman who&s;e Station and Choice leads him into much Company, and gay Life; but to Men who&s;e Circum&s;tances, if not their Inclinations, require a more retired way of Life, it is obvious, a Woman, who&s;e Talents lie principally in Conver&s;ation, can never, for that Rea&s;on <HI>only,</HI> ju&s;tify a young Gentleman for chu&s;ing her for a Wife.</P>
<P>I hope this will come time enough to put you upon guarding again&s;t the Inconveniencies that threaten the Indulgence of your pre&s;ent Pa&s;&s;ion. Shut not your Ears to Rea&s;on; forget not your|&s;elf; and be &s;ure to remember, that the Plea&s;ure of an <HI>Hour or Two,</HI> and of Twenty, Thirty, or Forty Years, or a <HI>whole Life,</HI> mu&s;t ari&s;e from very different Sources.

This Con&s;ideration has &s;upported me under the many Afflictions I have my&s;elf endured: But for tho&s;e I have &s;hared with you, I cannot boa&s;t the &s;ame Alleviation. While our Father lived, he was your con&s;tant and unwearied Support, even after your Patrimony was &s;quander'd away. While our Mother remained, &s;he was every Week a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing your Nece&s;&s;ities, but what might more pro|perly be called your Levity and Extravagance.

<HEAD>LETTER XI. To a young Man too &s;oon keeping a Hor&s;e.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear <HI>Tom,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Always take great Plea&s;ure in hearing of your Welfare, and of every thing that makes for your Satisfaction and Comfort: But give me Leave to &s;ay, That I am &s;orry to hear you have &s;o early begun to keep a Hor&s;e, e&s;pecially as your Bu&s;ine&s;s is altogether in your Shop, and you have no End to &s;erve in riding out; and are, be&s;ides, young and healthy,, and &s;o cannot require it, as Exerci&s;e. And is it worth while, think you, to keep a Hor&s;e the whole Week, that you may have him at hand on a <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, if the Day proves fair, and you have nothing to keep you in Town?</P>
<P>You mu&s;t con&s;ider, that tho' here, in the Country, many common Trade&s;men keep Hor&s;es, the Expence is but &s;mall to them, and the Di&s;tance of one Cu&s;tomer from another, in a manner obliges them to it. But this can be no Plea for you: And if you do not want a Hor&s;e
<PB N="23" REF="38">
for Exerci&s;e, you can only alledge the wor&s;t Rea|&s;on in the World for your maintaining one; that your Neighbours all round you do the &s;ame: For, look who they are, and what their Motives, and you'll &s;oon &s;ee the Difference, and that their Example will not ju&s;tify you. Mr. <HI>Thomp&s;on,</HI> for In&s;tance, who lives next Door to you, is near Sixty Years of Age, of a pretty gro&s;s Con|&s;titution, and capable of no other Exerci&s;e; and moreover he had acquired, by Length of Time, and Indu&s;try, an ample Fortune, before he gave him&s;elf this Diver&s;ion. Mr. <HI>Jenkins</HI> has an E&s;tate fallen to him, that &s;ets him above the Want of Trade; and his continuing in it, is rather an Amu&s;ement than an Employment. Mr. <HI>Jack&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>We&s;t,</HI> Mr. <HI>Trozier,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Kent,</HI> are all Men of e&s;tabli&s;hed Fortunes; and when you are as old as the <HI>younge&s;t</HI> of them, and can as well afford it, I would be far from di&s;&s;uading you from keeping a Hor&s;e. But at pre&s;ent, you may de|pend upon it, you rather incur their Contempt, than gain their E&s;teem, by offering to appear their Equal, when they and you well know, in what relates to Expences, you ought not to be &s;o, nor have you had a Time for it. The lower Part of the World may, perhaps, &s;hew you more Re&s;pect for tho&s;e Marks of Sub&s;tance; but &s;hould a Time come (and who is exempt from Misfor|tunes?) when they mu&s;t know they were the Effects of unthinking Levity; how de&s;picable mu&s;t you then appear in their Eyes? And, let me tell you, that the E&s;teem of Per&s;ons of Credit and Under&s;tanding, mu&s;t be gained by very dif|ferent Means, from Shew or Equipage; for with the&s;e, Mode&s;ty, Prudence, and good Sen&s;e only, will ever prevail.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="39">
Be&s;ides, the Expence of the Hor&s;e is not the lea&s;t thing to be con&s;idered: It will in time, very probably, lead you into a more dangerous one, that of be&s;towing too much of your Time in the U&s;e of it. It will unhinge your Mind, as I may &s;ay, from Bu&s;ine&s;s, and give your Servants Oppor|tunity to be remi&s;s in your Ab&s;ence. And as you are a young Man, it is fit that you &s;hould lay up, by your Indu&s;try, again&s;t a more advanced Age, when the Exerci&s;e a Hor&s;e affords, will &s;eem not only more &s;uitable, but perhaps ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to your Health; whereas now, it may rather pa&s;s for Wantonne&s;s and Affectation.</P>
<P>You are not without a tolerable Share of Rea|&s;on; let me prevail with you to u&s;e it: Sell your Hor&s;e, and fear not being laugh'd at on that Ac|count; for it will be a Credit to you more Ways than one, to &s;ay, That your Bu&s;ine&s;s would not allow you Time to u&s;e it. And it would argue be&s;ides, great Perver&s;ene&s;s, to continue in an Er|ror, for no other Rea&s;on than to &s;upport a wrong Judgment at fir&s;t &s;etting out: And your reducing an unnece&s;&s;ary Expence in good time, will more than recover any good Opinion you may have lo&s;t by running into it.</P>

<P>I am far from de&s;iring to abridge you in any nece&s;&s;ary or innocent Liberty, or to pre&s;cribe too much to your Choice of a Friend: Nor am I again&s;t your being complai&s;ant to <HI>Sirangers;</HI> for this Gentleman's Acquaintance is not yet a Month old with you; but you mu&s;t not think every Man who&s;e Conver&s;ation is agreeable, fit to be imme|diately treated as a Friend: Of all Sorts, ha&s;tily|contracted Friend&s;hips promi&s;e the lea&s;t Duration or Satisfaction; as they mo&s;t commonly ari&s;e from De&s;ign on one Side, and Weakne&s;s on the other. <HI>True Friend&s;hip</HI> mu&s;t be the Effect of long and mutual E&s;teem and Knowledge: It ought to have for its Cement, an Equality of Years, a Similitude of Manners, and, pretty much, a Parity in Circum&s;tance and Degree. But, generally &s;peaking, an Openne&s;s to a Stranger carries with it &s;trong Marks of Indi&s;cretion, and not &s;eldom ends in Repentance.</P>

For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, I would be glad you would be upon your Guard, and proceed cautiou&s;ly in this new Alliance. Mr. <HI>Douglas</HI> has Vivacity and Humour enough to plea&s;e any Man of a light Turn; but where I to give my Judgment of him, I &s;hould pronounce him fitter for the Tea-table, than the Cabinet.

He has been &s;et up Three Years, and has very good Bu&s;ine&s;s, and lives in Credit and Fa&s;hion.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI. A Father to a Son, to di&s;&s;uade him from the Vice of Drinking to Exce&s;s.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Son,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with a Grief proportioned to my Love, which is extreme, that I under&s;tand you have of late neglected your Studies, and given your&s;elf up to the odious Vice of Drinking: What &s;hall I &s;ay, what &s;hall I do, to engage you to quit this pernicious Practice, before it becomes &s;uch a Habit, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible, or at lea&s;t very difficult, for you to ca&s;t it off? Let me require, let me in|treat you, to give a &s;uitable Attention to what I have to &s;ay on this Head, which I &s;hall offer rather as a warm Friend, than an angry Father; and as I addre&s;s my&s;elf to your Rea&s;on, I will leave it to your&s;elf to judge of the Truth of the Ob&s;ervations I have to make to you.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, with re&s;pect to <HI>Health,</HI> the greate&s;t Jewel of this Life, it is the mo&s;t de&s;tructive of all Vices: <HI>A&s;thma's, Vertigoes, Pal&s;ies, Apo|plexies,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="61">
<HI>Gouts, Colicks, Fevers, Drop&s;ies, Con|&s;umptions, Stone,</HI> and <HI>Hypochondriack Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> are naturally introduced by exce&s;&s;ive Drinking.</P>
<P>All the re&s;t of the Vices together, are not &s;o often puni&s;hed with &s;udden Death as this one: What fatal Accidents, what Quarrels, what Breaches between Friend and Friend, are owing to it?</P>
<P>Then, in the &s;econd Place; How does it de|face Rea&s;on, de&s;troy all the tender Impul&s;es of Nature, make a wi&s;e Man a Fool, and &s;ubject Per&s;ons of the brighte&s;t Parts to the Contempt of the weake&s;t, and even, in time, extingui&s;h tho&s;e &s;hining Qualities, which con&s;titute the Difference between a Man of Sen&s;e and a Blockhead? For, as a certain very eminent Author well ob&s;erves, Fools having generally &s;tronger Nerves, and le&s;s volatile Spirits, than Men of fine Under&s;tandings, that which will rou&s;e the one, will make the other either &s;tupid or frantick; and tho' it &s;ometimes, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Fit continues, &s;trengthens the Imagination, yet it always depre&s;&s;es the Judgment; and after the Fit is over, both tho&s;e Faculties langui&s;h together, till, in time, it quenches the Imagination, impairs the Memory, and drowns the Judgment.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t other Vices are compatible, as the &s;ame Author ob&s;erves, with &s;everal Virtues; but Drun|kenne&s;s runs counter to all the Duties of Life. A great Drinker can hardly be either a good Hu&s;band, a good Father, a good Son, a good Brother, or a good Friend: It lays him open to the wor&s;t Com+pany, and this Company frequently &s;ubjects him to lewd Women, Gaming, Quarrels, Riots, and often Murders. All other Vices, even the greate&s;t of Vices, as Ambition, Uncha&s;tity, Bigotry, Avarice, Hypocri&s;y, dete&s;t this unnatural and wor&s;e than bea&s;tly Vice; for the Bea&s;ts them&s;elves,
<PB N="47" REF="62">
even the uncleane&s;t of them, know nothing of it, much le&s;s practi&s;e it.</P>
<P>Other Vices indeed make Men <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> &s;ays this judicious Author; but this <HI>alters</HI> Men from <HI>them|&s;elves,</HI> to that degree, that they differ not more from their <HI>pre&s;ent Companions,</HI> than from their <HI>former Selves.</HI> A Habitude of it will make the Prudent incon&s;iderate, the Ambitious indolent, the Active idle, and the Indu&s;trious &s;lothful; &s;o that their Affairs are ruin'd for want of Applica|tion, or by being intru&s;ted in the Hands of tho&s;e, who turn them wholly to their own Advantage, and, in the End, to the Ruin of tho&s;e who employ them.</P>
<P>I have written a long Letter already: Yet have I &s;till more to &s;ay, which, that I may not tire you, I will leave to another Letter; which the next Po&s;t &s;hall bring you. And I am, mean time, in hopes <HI>this</HI> will not lo&s;e its proper Effect,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Son,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY my former you will &s;ee, that hard Drinking is a Vice, that breaks a Man's Re&s;t, impairs the Under&s;tanding, extingui&s;hes the Memory, inflames the Pa&s;&s;ions, debauches the Will, lays the Founda|tion of the wor&s;t and mo&s;t dangerous Di&s;tempers, in|capacitates a Per&s;on from pur&s;uing his Studies, and from applying to the Duties of his Calling, be it what it will; begets Contempt from the World; and even if a Man's Circum&s;tances were above feeling the Expence, which can hardly be, alters
<PB N="48" REF="63">
and changes the Practi&s;er of it from him&s;elf; and if he is <HI>not</HI> above feeling it, often reduces him to Want and Beggary: And if he has a Family, his Children, who by their Father's Indu&s;try and Sobriety might have made a creditable Figure in Life, are left to the Mercy of the World, become the Outca&s;ts of the Earth; po&s;&s;ibly Foot-&s;oldiers, Livery-&s;ervants, Shoe-cleaners, Link-boys, and, perhaps, Pickpockets, Highwaymen, or Foot+pads; and in&s;tead of a comfortable Livelihood, and a Station above Contempt, are intitled only to Shame, Mi&s;ery, and the Gallows.</P>
<P>And do <HI>you</HI> judge, my Son, how a Man can an&s;wer this Conduct to God, to his Parents and other Relations, to his Wife, to his Children, to him&s;elf, and per&s;i&s;t in a barbarous and an unnatural Vice, which makes him&s;elf not only mi&s;erable and contemptible, but tran&s;mits the Mi&s;chief to his unhappy and innocent Children, if he has any.</P>
<P>Add to all this, That it is a Vice a Man cannot ea&s;ily ma&s;ter and &s;ubdue; or which, like &s;ome others, may be cured by <HI>Age;</HI> but it is a Vice that feeds and nouri&s;hes it&s;elf by Practice, and grows upon a Man as he lives longer in the World, till at la&s;t, if it cuts him not off in the Flower of his Days, his Body expects and requires Liquor: And &s;o, tho' a Man, when he enters upon it, may be &s;ingle, yet if he ever &s;hould marry, it may he attended with all the frightful and de|plorable Con&s;equences I have mentioned, and ruin be&s;ides an innocent and perhaps prudent Woman, rendering her, without <HI>her own</HI> Fault, the joint unhappy Cau&s;e of adding to the Number of the mi&s;erable and profligate Children, with which the World too much abounds, and which is owing to nothing &s;o much as this dete&s;table Sin in the Parents.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="64">
Con&s;ider all the&s;e things, my dear Son, and be|fore it be too late, get the better of a Vice, that you will find difficult to &s;ubdue, when it is grown to a Head, and which will otherwi&s;e creep upon you every Day more and more, till it &s;huts up your Life in Mi&s;ery as to your&s;elf, and Contempt as to the World; and in&s;tead of giving Cau&s;e even to your neare&s;t and be&s;t Friends to remember you with Plea&s;ure, will make it a Kindne&s;s in them to forget they ever had in the World, if a <HI>Parent,</HI> &s;uch a <HI>Son;</HI> if a <HI>Tutor,</HI> &s;uch a <HI>Pupil;</HI> if a <HI>Brother</HI> or <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> &s;uch an unhappy <HI>near Relation;</HI> if a <HI>Wife,</HI> &s;uch a <HI>Hu&s;band;</HI> if a <HI>Child,</HI> &s;uch a <HI>Father;</HI> and if a <HI>Friend,</HI> &s;uch a <HI>wretched one,</HI> that cannot be thought of without Pity and Regret, for having &s;hortened his Days, and ruin'd his Affairs, by &s;o pernicious a Habit.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. <HI>Barret,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry your ill U&s;age con&s;trains me to write to you in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing manner. Can you think it is po&s;&s;ible to carry on Bu&s;ine&s;s after the manner you act by me? You know what Promi&s;es you have made me, and how from time to time you have broke them. And can I depend upon any new ones you make? If you u&s;e <HI>others</HI> as you do me, how can you think of carrying on Bu&s;ine&s;s? If you do <HI>not,</HI> what mu&s;t I think of a Man who deals wor&s;e with me, than he does with any body el&s;e?&mdash;If you think you may tre&s;pa&s;s more upon <HI>me,</HI> than you can on <HI>others,</HI> this is a very bad Com|pliment to my <HI>Prudence,</HI> or your own <HI>Gratitude.</HI> For &s;urely good U&s;age &s;hould be intitled to good U&s;age. I know how to allow for Di&s;appointments as well as any Man; but can a Man be di&s;appoint|ed for ever? Trade is &s;o dependent a thing, you know, that it cannot be carried on without mu|tual Punctuality. Does not the Merchant expect it from me, for tho&s;e very Goods I &s;end you? And can I make a Return to him, without receiving it from you? What End can it an&s;wer to give you Two Years Credit, and then be at an Uncertainty, for Goods which I &s;ell at a &s;mall Profit, and have
<PB N="55" REF="70">
not Six Months Credit for my&s;elf? Indeed, Sir, this will never do. I mu&s;t be more punctually u&s;ed by you, or el&s;e mu&s;t deal as little punctually with others; and what then mu&s;t be the Con&s;e|quence?&mdash;In &s;hort, Sir, I expect a hand&s;ome Pay|ment by the next Return, and Security for the Remainder; and &s;hall be very loth to take any har&s;h Methods to procure this Ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, my Family, and my own Creditors.

<P>I MUST acknowledge I have not u&s;ed you well, and can give no better An&s;wer to your ju&s;t Ex|po&s;tulations, than to &s;end you the inclo&s;ed Draught for 50 <HI>l.</HI> which you will be plea&s;ed to carry to my Credit; and to a&s;&s;ure you of more punctual Treatment for the future.

<HEAD>LETTER XLVI. To a young Trader generally in a Hurry in Bu&s;ine&s;s, advi&s;ing <HI>Method</HI> as well as <HI>Di|ligence.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Nephew,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Affection I have always borne you, as well for your own &s;ake, as for your late Fa|ther's and Mother's, makes me give you the Trouble of the&s;e Lines, which I hope you will receive as kindly as I intend them.</P>
<P>I have lately call'd upon you &s;everal times, and have as often found you in an extraordinary Hurry; which I well know cannot be &s;ometimes avoided; but, methinks, need not be always the Ca&s;e, if your Time were di&s;po&s;ed in regular and proper Pro|portions to your Bu&s;ine&s;s. I have frequently had Rea&s;on to believe, that more than half the Flutter which appears among Traders in general, is rather the Effect of their <HI>Indolence,</HI> than their <HI>Indu&s;try;</HI> however willing they are to have it thought other|wi&s;e; and I will give you one In&s;tance in Confir|mation of this Opinion, in a Neighbour of mine.</P>
<P>This Gentleman carried on for &s;ome Years a profitable Bu&s;ine&s;s; but indulging him&s;elf every Evening in a Tavern Society or Club, which the Promotion of Bu&s;ine&s;s (as is u&s;ually the Ca&s;e) gave the fir&s;t Pretence for, he looked upon tho&s;e En|gagements as the natural Con&s;equence of the Ap|proach of Night; and drove on his Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Day with Precipitation, that he might get thither with the earlie&s;t. He &s;eldom kept very late Hours, tho' he never came home &s;oon. The Night being gone, and his Bottle empty'd, the Morning was always wanted to di&s;pel the Fumes of the Wine.
<PB N="57" REF="72">
Whoever therefore came to him before Nine, was de&s;ired to call again; and when he ro&s;e, &s;o many Matters waited for him, as directly threw him into a Flutter; &s;o that from his Ri&s;ing till Dinner|time, he &s;eem'd in one continued Forment. A long Dinner-time he always allowed him&s;elf, in order to recover the Fatigues he had undergone; and all his Table-talk was, How heavy his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s lay upon him! And what Pains he took in it! The hearty Meal, and the Time he indulged him|&s;elf at Table, begot an Inappetency for any more Bu&s;ine&s;s for that &s;hort Afternoon; &s;o all that <HI>could</HI> be deferr'd, was put off to the next Morning; and long'd-for Evening approaching, he flies to his u&s;ual Solace: Empties his Bottle by Eleven: Comes home: Gets to Bed; and is invi&s;ible till next Morning at Nine; and then ri&s;ing, enters upon his u&s;ual Hurry and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus did his Life &s;eem to tho&s;e who &s;aw him in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, one con&s;tant Scene of Fatigue, tho' he &s;carce ever apply'd to it Four regular Hours in any one Day. Whereas had he ri&s;en <HI>only</HI> at Seven in the Morning, he would have got all his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s under by Noon; and tho&s;e Two Hours, from Seven to Nine, being before many People go abroad, he would have met with no Interruption in his Affairs; but might have improved his Servants by his own Example, directed them in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day, have in&s;pected his Books, written to his Dealers, and put every thing in &s;o regular a Train, for the re&s;t of the Day, that whatever had occurr'd afterwards, would rather have &s;erved to divert than fatigue him.</P>
<P>And what, to cut my Story &s;hort, was the Up|&s;hot of the Matter? Why, meeting with &s;ome Di&s;appointments and Lo&s;&s;es, (as all Traders mu&s;t expect, and ought to provide for) and his Cu&s;tom|ers
<PB N="58" REF="73">
not &s;eeing him in his Shop &s;o much as they expected, and when there, always in a di&s;obliging petulant Hurry; and moreover, Mi&s;takes frequent|ly happening through the Flurry into which he put him&s;elf and every one about him; by the&s;e means his Bu&s;ine&s;s dwindled away in&s;en&s;ibly, and not being able to go out of his u&s;ual Cour&s;e, which helped to impair both his Capacity and Ar|dor to Bu&s;ine&s;s, his Creditors began to look about them, and he was compelled to enter into the State of his Affairs; and then had the Mortifica|tion to find the Balance of 2000 <HI>l.</HI> again&s;t him.</P>
<P>This was a &s;hocking Ca&s;e to him&s;elf; but more to his Family; for his Wife had lived, and his Children had been educated, in &s;uch a manner, as induced them to hope their Fortunes would be &s;ufficient to place them in a State of Independence.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, being obliged to quit a Bu&s;ine&s;s, he had managed with &s;o little Prudence, his Friends got him upon a charitable Foundation, which afforded him bare Sub&s;i&s;tence for him&s;elf. His Children were di&s;per&s;ed &s;ome one way and &s;ome another, into low Scenes of Life, and his Wife went home to her Friends, to be &s;nubb'd and reflected on by her own Family, for Faults not her own.</P>
<P>This Example will afford &s;everal good Hints, to a young Trade&s;man, which are too obvious to need expatiating upon. And as I dare &s;ay, your Pru|dence will keep you from the like Fault, you will never have Rea&s;on to reproach your&s;elf on this Score. But yet, as I always found you in a Hurry, when I called upon you, I could not but give you this Hint, for fear you &s;hould not rightly propor|tion your Time to your Bu&s;ine&s;s, and le&s;t you &s;hould &s;u&s;pend to the <HI>next</HI> Hour, what you could and ought to do in the <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> and &s;o did not keep your Bu&s;ine&s;s properly under. Method is
<PB N="59" REF="74">
every thing in Bu&s;ine&s;s, next to Diligence. And you will by falling into a regular one, always be calm and unruffled, and have time to be&s;tow in your Shop with your Cu&s;tomers; the Female ones e&s;pecially; who always love to make a great many Words in their Bargainings, and expect to be hu|mour'd and per&s;uaded: And how can any Man find Time for this, if he prefers the Tavern to his Shop, and his Bed to his Bu&s;ine&s;s? I know you will take in good Part what I have written, becau&s;e you are &s;en&s;ible how much I am</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER the many Occa&s;ions I have given for your Di&s;plea&s;ure, permit me to a&s;k your Advice in an Affair which may render my whole Life com|fortable or mi&s;erable. You know, Sir, to what a low Ebb my Folly and Extravagance have reduced me: Your generous Indulgence has made you &s;tretch your Power, to my Shame I &s;peak it, even beyond the Bounds which Wi&s;dom, and a nece&s;&s;ary Regard to the re&s;t of your Family would permit; there|fore, I cannot hope for further A&s;&s;i&s;tance from you. Something, however, I mu&s;t re&s;olve upon to gain a Maintenance: And an Accident fell out Ye&s;terday, which offers me, at lea&s;t, pre&s;ent Bread.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rich,</HI> Ma&s;ter of one of the Theatres, hap|pened to dine at my Uncle's when I was there: After Dinner, the Subject of Di&s;cour&s;e was, the

Art of a Comedian: On which my Uncle took Occa&s;ion to mention the little Flights in that way with which I have diverted my&s;elf in my gayer Moments; and partly compelled me to give an In&s;tance of my Abilities. Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> was plea&s;ed to declare his Approbation of my Manner and Voice; and on being told my Circum&s;tances, offer'd, at once to take me into his Company with an Allow|ance &s;ufficient for pre&s;ent Sub&s;i&s;tence, and addi|tional Encouragement, as I &s;hould be found to de&s;erve it. Half a Benefit he promi&s;ed me the fir&s;t Sea&s;on; which, by my (otherwi&s;e too) numerous Acquaintaince might, I believe, be turned to pretty good Account. I am not fond of this Life; but &s;ee no other Means of &s;upporting my&s;elf like a Gentleman. Your &s;peedy An&s;wer, will be ever gratefully acknowledged by, honoured Sir,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear <HI>Gilbert,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SHOULD be glad to have you in any Situa|tion, which would afford you a comfortable and reputable Sub&s;i&s;tence: But cannot think the Life of a Stage-player proper for that End. You mu&s;t con&s;ider, that tho' in the gay Trappings of that Employment a Man may repre&s;ent a Gentleman, yet none can be farther from that Character if a perpetual Dependence be the wor&s;t Kind of Ser|vility. In the fir&s;t Place, the Company you will be in a manner obliged to keep, will be &s;uch as will tend little to the Improvement of your Mind, or

<HEAD>LETTER XLIX. To a Brother too captious to bear him&s;elf the Ridicule he practi&s;es upon others.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear <HI>Jack,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM glad to find you improve both in <HI>Thought</HI> and <HI>Speech.</HI> You know I am no Witch at either: But &s;o as we have &s;ome Wit in our Family, no matter who is at the Trouble of carrying it for what he'll get by it. I &s;uppo&s;e you thought to give no &s;mall Plea&s;ure to the Company la&s;t Night by your facetious Flings at all around you, not
<PB N="62" REF="77">
excepting the Par&s;on him&s;elf: But &s;hould you not have con&s;idered, that every one in the Room had a Right to return the Freedom you took, in the be&s;t manner he was able? Was it therefore well in you to re&s;ent &s;o warmly as you did, a &s;mart Re|mark, made by Mr. <HI>Cri&s;pe,</HI> on a palpable Blunder of your own, when you had taken &s;o much Liber|ty with him, as well as every body el&s;e, ju&s;t before? Indeed, Brother, you mu&s;t either lay a&s;ide Ridicule, or learn to bear it better; and in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e you &s;hould have remember'd, that, in the manner you began with that Gentleman, it was not po&s;&s;i|ble for him to &s;ay any thing it would have been your Credit to re&s;ent. A Retort on the&s;e Occa|&s;ions mu&s;t be excu&s;ed, tho' fraught with Re&s;ent|ment; for a Man is not always in a Humour to be je&s;ted with, and it is the Duty of him who be|gins, to take what follows. Your failing in this known Rule; whatever you may think, has made you appear in &s;o mean a Light to the whole Com|pany, that all your Acutene&s;s will not in ha&s;te atone for it.</P>
<P>If I judge rightly, nothing is more delicate than Ridicule: Where it is conducted with Prudence and Humour, it is &s;ure to plea&s;e even the Man who is the Subject of it, if he is not of a moro&s;e Temper: But when, in&s;tead of that, per&s;onal Fail|ings, or private Indi&s;cretions, are expo&s;ed for the Entertainment of a Company, tho' you may think to rai&s;e a Laugh by it in the Unreflecting, it will bring upon you the Cen&s;ure of the Con&s;iderate. It is our Duty to con&s;ult what we can <HI>bear</HI> our&s;elves, as well as what we can <HI>inflict</HI> on others. For my own Part, I know I cannot bear what is called a <HI>clo&s;e Rub,</HI> as many Men can, and for that Rea&s;on I never je&s;t with any body, unle&s;s by way of Re|pri&s;al, and that I &s;horten all I can, le&s;t my Tem|per &s;hould not hold out.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="78">
No doubt but you have more Humour than I; but if you do not blend in it a Quantity of Temper &s;ufficient to carry it off, you will be no Gainer by the Qualification.

Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pitt</HI> were long the intimate Friends and Companions of your Father; for more than Thirty Years, he had experienc'd their Candor and Wi&s;|dom; and it was their Fitne&s;s for the Tru&s;t, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">duced him to leave you to their Care; and will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> reflect upon his Judgment?</P>
<P>They are not le&s;s wi&s;e now, than when he made his Will; and if they happen to differ from your Judgment in any thing of Moment, what Room have you to &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elf better able to judge of the Con&s;equences of what you de&s;ire, than they. I do not undervalue your good Sen&s;e, and yet I mu&s;t tell you, that (the Difference of Years con&s;ider'd, and their Knowledge of the World, which yet you can know little of) it would he &s;trange if they did not know better than you, what was proper for you; and their Hone&s;ty was never yet di&s;puted. Upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations, who is mo&s;t probably to blame, &s;hould you happen to di&s;agree? From &s;uch Men, you will never meet more Re&s;traints than is nece&s;&s;ary for your Happi|ne&s;s and Intere&s;t; for nothing that can injure <HI>you</HI> in any re&s;pect, can add to <HI>their</HI> Advantage or Re|putation. I have known &s;everal young Ladies of your Age impatient of the lea&s;t Controul, and think hardly of every little Contradiction; but when, by any unadvi&s;ed Step, they have relea&s;ed them&s;elves, as they call it, from the Care of their try'd Friends, how often have they had Cau&s;e to repent their Ra&s;hne&s;s?

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear <HI>Bet,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT I wrote in my former, was on a Suppo|&s;ition that you had too much Rea&s;on to be unea&s;y at your Hu&s;band's Conduct.</P>
<P>I will now pur&s;ue the Subject, and put the Ca&s;e that you have no <HI>Proof</HI> that he is guilty, but your Surmizes, or, perhaps, the bu&s;y <HI>Whi&s;perings</HI> of offi|cious <HI>Make-debates.</HI> In this Ca&s;e, take care, my <HI>Bet&s;ey,</HI> that you don't, by the Violence of your Pa&s;|&s;ions,
<PB N="69" REF="84">
precipitate him on the Cour&s;e you dread, and that you alienate not, by unju&s;t Su&s;picions, his Affections from you; for then perhaps he will be ready <HI>indeed</HI> to place them &s;omewhere el&s;e, where you may not &s;o ea&s;ily draw him off; for he will, may be, think, as to <HI>you</HI> (if he be devoid of <HI>&s;upe|rior</HI> Con&s;iderations) that he may as well <HI>de&s;erve</HI> your Su&s;picions, as be tiezed with them <HI>without</HI> de&s;erving them.</P>
<P>I know it is a mo&s;t &s;hocking thing to a &s;ober young Woman, to think her&s;elf obliged to <HI>&s;hare</HI> tho&s;e Affections which ought to be <HI>all her own,</HI> with a <HI>vile Pro&s;titute,</HI> be&s;ides the Danger, which is not &s;mall, of being intirely circumvented in her Hu&s;band's <HI>Love,</HI> and perhaps have only his <HI>In|difference,</HI> if not <HI>Contempt,</HI> in&s;tead of it. But, my Dear, at the wor&s;t, comfort your&s;elf that <HI>you</HI> are not the guilty Per&s;on, for one Day he will, per|haps, fatally find his Error. And con&s;ider, be|&s;ides, my <HI>Bet&s;ey,</HI> that your Ca&s;e, from an unfaith|ful <HI>Hu&s;band,</HI> is not near &s;o bad as his would be from an unfaithful <HI>Wife:</HI> For, Child, he cannot make the Progeny of a <HI>Ba&s;tard Race</HI> &s;ucceed to his and your E&s;tate or Chattels, in Injury of your <HI>lawful Children.</HI> If any &s;uch he &s;hould have, the Law of the Land <HI>brands</HI> them: Whereas a <HI>naughty Wife</HI> often makes the Children of <HI>another Man,</HI> Heirs of her Hu&s;band's E&s;tate and Fortune, in In|jury of his <HI>own Children</HI> or <HI>Family.</HI> So, tho' the Crime may be equal in <HI>other Re&s;pects,</HI> yet this makes the Injury of the Woman to the Man, greater than <HI>his</HI> can be to <HI>her.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Thoughts I have thrown together, as they occurred in two Letters, that I might not tire you with a Length, that, yet, the important Subject re|quired. Let me briefly &s;um up the Contents.</P>

If he be <HI>guilty,</HI> try by Softne&s;s and kind Expo|&s;tulations to reclaim him, before the Vice be rooted in him.

<P>But if your Unea&s;ine&s;s be owing to <HI>private Tale|bearers</HI> and <HI>bu&s;y Intermeddlers;</HI> take care, my Dear, you are not made a Property of by &s;uch mi&s;chievous People.

<HEAD>LETTER LVI. From a tender Father to an ungracious Son,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Son <HI>John,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM under no &s;mall Concern, that your con|tinued ill Cour&s;es give me Occa&s;ion to write this Letter to you. I was in hopes, that your &s;olemn Promi&s;es of Amendment might have been better depended on; but I &s;ee, to my great Mor|tification, that all I have done for you, and all I have &s;aid to you, is thrown away. What can I &s;ay more than I <HI>have &s;aid?</HI> Yet, <HI>once more</HI> am I de&s;irous to try what the Force of a <HI>Letter</HI> will do with one who has not &s;uffer'd mere <HI>Words</HI> to have any Effect upon him. Perhaps this remaining with you, if you will now and then &s;eriou&s;ly peru&s;e it, may, in &s;ome happy Moment, give you <HI>Reflection,</HI> and by God's Grace, bring on your <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Amendment.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;ider then, I be&s;eech you, in time, the Evil of your Ways. Make <HI>my</HI> Ca&s;e <HI>your own;</HI> and think, if <HI>you</HI> were to be Father of &s;uch a Son, how his Actions would grieve and afflict you. But if <HI>my</HI> Comfort has no Weight with you, con&s;ider, my Son, how your pre&s;ent Cour&s;es mu&s;t impair, in time, a good Con&s;titution, de&s;troy your Health, and, mo&s;t probably, &s;horten your Life. Con&s;ider that your <HI>Reputation</HI> is wounded, I hope, not mor|tally,
<PB N="72" REF="87">
as yet. That you will be ranked among the Profligate and Outca&s;ts of the World; that no virtuous Man will keep you Company; that every one who has a Regard for his own Credit will &s;hun you; and that you will be given up to the Society of the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t abandon'd</HI> of Men, when you might be improved by the Examples of the <HI>Be&s;t.</HI> That no Family which values their own Honour, and the Welfare of their Child, will &s;uffer your Addre&s;&s;es to a Daughter worthy of being &s;ought after for a Wife, &s;hould you incline to marry; and that the wor&s;t of that Sex mu&s;t probably, in that Ca&s;e, fall to your Lot, which will make you mi&s;erable in <HI>this World,</HI> when you might be happy.</P>
<P>Then, as to <HI>another World</HI> beyond this tran&s;itory one, my Heart trembles for what mo&s;t probably will be the Con&s;equence to your poor Soul: For the human Mind is &s;eldom <HI>at a &s;tay;</HI> if you do not grow <HI>better,</HI> you will mo&s;t undoubtedly grow <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> and you may run into tho&s;e Sins and Evils, that you <HI>now</HI> perhaps think your&s;elf incapable of; as <HI>already</HI> you are arrived at a Height of Folly and Wickedne&s;s, that once you would have thought you could not have been guilty of. Don't, my dear Son, let your poor Mother and me have the Mortification to think, that we have been the un|happy Means of giving Life to a Child of Perdition, in&s;tead of a Child of Glory; that <HI>our</HI> beloved Son with all the Pains we have taken to in&s;til good Principles into his Mind, in hopes he would one day prove a Credit and Comfort to his Family, &s;hould, in&s;tead of an&s;wering our longing Wi&s;hes, when at Age, take &s;uch contrary Cour&s;es, as will make us join to wi&s;h he had never been born.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, my dear Son, we don't want any thing of <HI>you</HI> but <HI>your own Good.</HI> We lived before you were born. You have been a great Expence to us
<PB N="73" REF="88">
to bring you up to the&s;e Years. You cannot now live without <HI>us,</HI> but we can without <HI>you.</HI> We hope God will continue your Life to be &s;till a <HI>fur|ther Expence</HI> to us. For all we live for, is our Chil|drens Good. Let then the <HI>Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s</HI> of our Plea move you. Be but good to <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> that is all we require of you. Let us but have Rea&s;on to hope, that when we are <HI>dead</HI> and <HI>gone,</HI> you will &s;upport our Name with Credit, and be no Burden to your poor Si&s;ters, nor Di&s;grace to our Memories. Shew us that you are of a <HI>generous,</HI> not of a <HI>&s;ordid</HI> Nature; and will probably &s;et your&s;elf above fu|ture Misfortunes by reclaiming in time, and then we &s;hall be happy. As God has done his Part by you, and given you Talents that every one cannot boa&s;t, let me beg you to con&s;ider only, how much more noble it is to be in &s;uch a Situation as &s;hall enable you to <HI>confer</HI> Benefits, than &s;uch an one as &s;hall lay you under the poor Nece&s;&s;ity to <HI>receive</HI> them from others, and, perhaps, where they ought to be lea&s;t expected.</P>
<P>I have written a long Letter. The Subject is <HI>next my Heart,</HI> and will excu&s;e it. God give a Ble&s;&s;ing to it! God give you to &s;ee the Error of your Ways before it be too late, and before you get &s;uch a Habit as you cannot alter if you would. Let your poor Mother and Si&s;ters look upon you with <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI> rather than <HI>Apprehen&s;ion,</HI> in ca&s;e God Almighty &s;hould take me away from them: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">et them think of you as a <HI>Protector</HI> in my &s;tead, rather than as an ingrateful <HI>Spoiler</HI> among them; and you will then give Comfort to my Life, as long as God &s;hall &s;pare it, and alleviate, in&s;tead of aggra|vate, the Pangs of my dying Hour, when God &s;hall &s;end it.</P>

<P>Returning, on <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> from &s;eeing my Cou&s;in <HI>Atkins,</HI> in <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> I was over-taken by an elderly Gentlewoman of a &s;ober and creditable Appearance, who walked by my Side &s;ome little time before &s;he &s;poke to me; and then gue&s;&s;ing, (by my a&s;king the Name of the Street) that I was a Stranger to

I told her, If I could meet with a Place to my Mind, to wait upon a &s;ingle Lady, I &s;hould be very willing to embrace it. She &s;aid, I look'd like a creditable, &s;ober and mode&s;t Body, and at that very time &s;he knew one of the be&s;t Gentlewomen that ever lived, who was in great Want of a Maid to attend upon her own Per&s;on, and that if &s;he liked me, and I her, it would be a lucky Incident for us both.</P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf thankfully, and &s;he was &s;o very much in my Intere&s;t, as to intreat me to go in&s;tantly to the Lady, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be provided, and acquaint her I was recommended by Mrs. <HI>Jones,</HI> not doubting, as &s;he &s;aid, but, on Inquiry, my Character would an&s;wer my Appearance.</P>
<P>As that you know was partly my View in com|ing to Town, I thought this a happy Incident, and determined not to lo&s;e the Opportunity; and &s;o, according to the Direction &s;he gave me, I went to inquire for Mrs. <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> in <HI>J<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">n</HI>'s Court, <HI>Fleet-&s;treet.</HI> The Neighbourhood look'd genteel, and I &s;oon found the Hou&s;e. I a&s;ked for Mrs. <HI>C<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI>; &s;he came to me, dre&s;s'd in a &s;plendid Manner; I told her what I came about; &s;he immediately de|&s;ired me to walk into the Parlour, which was ele|gantly furni&s;hed; and after a&s;king me &s;everal Que|&s;tions, with my An&s;wers to which &s;he &s;eem'd very well plea&s;ed, a Servant &s;oon brought in a Bowl of warm Liquor, which &s;he called <HI>Negus,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of Wine, Water, Orange, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which, &s;he &s;aid, was for a Friend or two &s;he expected pre&s;ently; but as I was warm with walking, &s;he would have me drink &s;ome of it, telling me it was a plea&s;ant innocent Liquor,
<PB N="81" REF="98">
and &s;he always u&s;ed her waiting Maids, as &s;he did her&s;elf. I thought this was very kind and con|de&s;cending, and being warm and thir&s;ty, and &s;he encouraging me, I took a pretty free Draught of it, and thought it very plea&s;ant, as it really was. She made me &s;it down by her, &s;aying, Pride was not her Talent, and that &s;he &s;hould always indulge me in like manner, if I behaved well, when &s;he had not Company: and then &s;lightly a&s;ked what I could do, and the Wages I required? With my An&s;wers &s;he &s;eemed well &s;atisfied, and granted the Wages I a&s;ked, without any Offer of Abatement.</P>
<P>And then I ro&s;e up, in order to take my Leave, telling her I would, any Day &s;he plea&s;ed, of the en&s;uing Week, bring my Cloaths, and wait upon her.</P>
<P>She &s;aid, that her own Maid being gone away, &s;he was in the utmo&s;t Want of another, and would take it kindly, if I would &s;tay with her till next Day, becau&s;e &s;he was to have &s;ome Ladies to pa&s;s the Evening with her. I &s;aid this would be pretty inconvenient to me, but as &s;he was &s;o &s;ituated, I would oblige her, after I had been with my Aunt, and acquainted her with it. To this &s;he reply'd, that there was no manner of Occa&s;ion for that, be|cau&s;e &s;he could &s;end the Cook for what I wanted, who could, at the &s;ame time, tell my Aunt how Matters &s;tood.</P>
<P>I thought this looked a little odd; but &s;he did it with &s;o much Civility, and &s;eemed &s;o plea&s;ed with her new Maid, that I &s;carcely knew how to with|&s;tand her: But the Apprehen&s;ion I had of my Aunt's Anger for not a&s;king her Advice, in what &s;o nearly concerned me, made me in&s;i&s;t upon going, though I could perceive Di&s;plea&s;ure in her Coun|tenance when &s;he &s;aw me re&s;olv'd.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="99">
She then ply'd me very clo&s;e with the Liquor, which &s;he again &s;aid was innocent and weak; but I believe it was far otherwi&s;e; for my Head began to turn round, and my Stomach felt a little di&s;|ordered. I intreated the Favour of her to permit me to go, on a firm Promi&s;e of returning imme|diately; but then, my new Mi&s;tre&s;s began to rai&s;e her Voice a little, a&s;&s;uring me I &s;hould on no Ac|count, &s;tir out of her Hou&s;e. She left the Room, in a &s;ort of a Pet, but &s;aid &s;he would &s;end the Cook to take my Directions to my Aunt; and I heard her take the Key out of the outward Door.</P>
<P>This alarmed me very much; and, in the In|&s;tant of my Surprize, a young Gentlewoman en|tered the Parlour, dre&s;s'd in white Sattin, and every way genteel; &s;he &s;at down in a Chair next me, looked earne&s;tly at me a while, and &s;eemed going to &s;peak &s;everal times, but did not. At length &s;he ro&s;e from her Chair, bolted the Parlour-door, and, breaking into a Flood of Tears, expre&s;s'd her|&s;elf as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dear young Woman, I cannot tell you the Pain I feel on your Account; and from an In|clination to &s;erve you, I run a Hazard of in|volving my&s;elf in greater Mi&s;ery than I have yet experienced, if that can be.

<HEAD>LETTER LXIV. Of Expo&s;tulation from a grave Friend to a young Man, on his &s;lighting and irreverent Behaviour to his Father.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE the Freedom of a brief Expo&s;tulation with you on your Behaviour to your Father; and I hope you will receive it from me, with the &s;ame Good-will, that I mean it.</P>
<P>His Indulgence to you formerly, certainly claims better Returns on your Part, altho' it &s;hould be allow'd, as you fondly imagine, that his Affection to you is alienated. There may be &s;omething of Petulancy in him, which you ought to bear with; for one time or other you may be convinced by Ex|perience, that <HI>Age</HI> it&s;elf has its in&s;uperable Affli|ctions, that require the Allowance of every one; and more particularly of &s;uch who hope to live a long Life them&s;elves, and &s;till more particularly of a <HI>Son,</HI> who&s;e <HI>high Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> require, perhaps, at lea&s;t as <HI>much</HI> Allowance. He may be <HI>petulant;</HI> but are you not <HI>fiery</HI> and <HI>impetuous?</HI> And I would fain know, whether <HI>you</HI> ought to bear with <HI>him,</HI> or <HI>he</HI> with <HI>you?</HI></P>
<P>'Tis a very groundle&s;s Surmi&s;e to think his Af|fections are alienated from you. A Father <HI>mu&s;t</HI> love his Son. He cannot help it. And is it cre|dible even to your&s;elf, on cool Reflexion, that the &s;ame good Man who was wont to be delighted with your childi&s;h Vanities and Foibles, (for we have all had them more or le&s;s) and even indulged and per|haps cheri&s;hed tho&s;e youthful Forwardne&s;&s;es, that might be called the Seeds of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, which
<PB N="87" REF="104">
now, being &s;prung up, give him &s;o much Di&s;turb|ance, and make you &s;o impatient of Contradiction: Can you, I &s;ay, believe that this &s;ame good Man, without Rea&s;on, without Provocation, can change that Love into Hate?</P>
<P>You are grown to Man's E&s;tate, and tho' far from the ungracious Sons, that we have &s;een in the World, yet ought not to be &s;o partial to your&s;elf, as to believe you are wholly faultle&s;s. Examine your own Conduct then, and altho' you &s;hould not be able to charge your <HI>Intention</HI> with any Blame, yet you mu&s;t leave your <HI>Behaviour</HI> to be judg'd by others; and 'twill perhaps be given again&s;t you, that &s;ome Slight, &s;ome Negligence, &s;ome Inatten|tion, if not wor&s;e, too cutting for a Father's Cares and Fondne&s;s to &s;upport, has e&s;caped you. Then con&s;ider, Sir, what a grievous thing it mu&s;t be to him to reflect, that this Behaviour of yours, may be but the gradual Con&s;equence of his former In|dulgence to you, and that he is de&s;ervedly puni&s;h|ed, for not rooting up in your childi&s;h Days tho&s;e Weeds which now &s;pread to his Unea&s;ine&s;s. But let me tell you, Sir, that it ought to be a more &s;ad Reflection to a con&s;iderate young Gentleman, that <HI>he</HI> is to be the In&s;trument to puni&s;h his fond Fa|ther's faulty Indulgence to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have been a diligent Ob&s;erver of the Di&s;pen&s;a|tions of Providence in this re&s;pect, and have always &s;een the Sin of Undutifulne&s;s to Parents puni&s;hed in <HI>Kind,</HI> more than any one Sin. I have &s;een the <HI>Son</HI> of the undutiful Son, revenging the Cau&s;e of his <HI>Grandfather;</HI> and at the &s;ame time, intail'd a Cur&s;e upon <HI>his</HI> Son, if he has not been taken off childle&s;s, who, in his Turn, has retorted the un|gracious Behaviour; and thus a Cur&s;e has been in|tail'd by De&s;cent upon the Family, from one Ge|neration to another.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="105">
You'll &s;ay, that your Behaviour to your Father is not, you hope, of &s;uch an atrocious Nature, as to be attended with &s;uch terrible Con&s;equences; and perhaps will add, that you do not wi&s;h for a better Behaviour from your Son, than you &s;hew to your Father. But if this be not Partiality to your|&s;elf, pray con&s;ider, that while your Father takes your pre&s;ent Conduct in &s;o ill Part, and you u&s;e &s;o little Circum&s;pection to avoid giving him Di&s;gu&s;t, and have &s;o little Complai&s;ance, as not to &s;et him right; the thing is full as tormenting to him from the <HI>Appearance,</HI> as if it were <HI>real;</HI> nay, 'tis <HI>real</HI> to him, if he <HI>believes</HI> &s;o.</P>
<P>He thinks, and let me tell you, Sir, he thinks <HI>ju&s;tly,</HI> that he ought to expect as much Deference to <HI>his</HI> Will and Plea&s;ure <HI>now,</HI> as he has heretofore &s;hewn you Indulgence, even in tho&s;e things that now perhaps you are &s;o unkind to &s;uffer to turn &s;evere&s;t upon him. I would not recriminate: But it was with very little Reverence, and indeed with an <HI>Air</HI> as cen&s;urable as the <HI>Words,</HI> that you told him, in my Hearing, that he knew not what he would have: That he expected you to be more ac|countable at <HI>this</HI> Age, than when you were a <HI>Child,</HI> &amp;c. Why, dear Sir, does your being <HI>of Age,</HI> le&s;&s;en the Duty you owe to your Father? Are not his Cares for you allowably <HI>doubled,</HI> and ought he not now to expect from your good Sen&s;e, and more mature Under&s;tanding (improved, as it is to be hoped, by the Education he has, at a great Ex|pence, given you) <HI>greater</HI> Proofs of Duty, rather than <HI>le&s;s?</HI> He may forget, perhaps what he <HI>was at your Age,</HI> as you irreverently told him; but how much more laudable would it be, for you, at <HI>yours,</HI> to enter into what you would naturally expect from <HI>your Son,</HI> were you in the <HI>Place,</HI> and at the <HI>Age,</HI> of <HI>your Father.</HI> A generous Mind will do its Duty,
<PB N="89" REF="106">
tho' it were not to meet with &s;uitable Rewards or Returns; for even &s;hould your Father not do <HI>his</HI> by <HI>you,</HI> you are not ab&s;olved of <HI>yours</HI> to <HI>him;</HI> much le&s;s then, ought the <HI>natural,</HI> the <HI>con&s;equential,</HI> In|firmities of <HI>Age,</HI> to di&s;&s;olve the Duty of a Son to an indulgent Parent.</P>
<P>Be convinced, my dear Sir, of your wrong Con|duct, and don't think it beneath the high Spirit of a brave young Gentleman, to &s;ubmit to the Will of his Father. By your Dutifulne&s;s and Circum|&s;pection you may, in all Probability, add to the Number as well as the Comfort of <HI>his</HI> Days to whom you owe <HI>your</HI> Being. But whar a Woe does that young Man bring upon him&s;elf who robs his aged Parent in <HI>both</HI> re&s;pects! It behoves all Children to reflect upon this timely, and with Awe.</P>
<P>On how many Occa&s;ions has he heretofore re|joiced to me, on, even, the &s;malle&s;t Openings and Dawnings of your Mind and Genius! How has he dwelt on your Prai&s;es on even <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> Beauties, which have appeared &s;uch to his fond and partial Tenderne&s;s only! How has he extenuated your Failings, connived at your Faults, and extolled and brought forward into &s;trong Light, even the re|mote&s;t Appearance of Virtue in you. Such <HI>was</HI> always, and &s;uch, notwith&s;tanding the Intermixtures of <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Infirmity,</HI> and even of your continued <HI>Slights</HI> and <HI>Impatience,</HI> always <HI>will be,</HI> the In&s;tances of his paternal Affection for you. And I will ven|ture to &s;ay, that even this very Petulance, as you think it, is a Demon&s;tration of his Regard for you, however di&s;agreeable it may be to you, &s;ince he loves you too well to be in&s;en&s;ible to tho&s;e Parts of your Behaviour, which he thinks are owing to Slight or Negligence.</P>
<P>I have exceeded the Bounds I intended when I began, and would rather leave to your natural good

Sen&s;e, and cooler Reflection, what I have <HI>already</HI> urged, than tire you too much, with what might <HI>&s;till farther</HI> be added on this Occa&s;ion. But the Affection and Friend&s;hip I have for all your Fa|mily, and the long Intimacy I have had with your good Father (who, however, knows nothing of my writing) and the evil Con&s;equences that may follow a wider Breach between you, will an&s;wer for my Intention, and, I hope, for my Freedom, which I'll take upon me to &s;ay, I <HI>expect</HI> from your Candor and Education, being</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Cou&s;in,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;ure you have the good Sen&s;e to take kindly what I am going to mention to you, in which I can have no po&s;&s;ible View but your Benefit. When you were la&s;t with me at <HI>Hertford,</HI> you much ob|liged us all, with the In&s;tances you gave us of your Skill in Mu&s;ick, and your good Voice. But as you are &s;o young a Man, and &s;eem to be &s;o very much plea&s;ed <HI>your&s;elf</HI> with the&s;e Acquirements, I mu&s;t enter a Caution or two on this Score, becau&s;e of the Con&s;equences that may follow from too much Delight in the&s;e Amu&s;ements, which, while they are pur&s;ued as Amu&s;ements <HI>only,</HI> may be &s;afe and innocent; but when they take up too much of a Man's Time, may be not a little pernicious.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, my dear Cou&s;in, the&s;e Plea|&s;ures of <HI>Sound,</HI> may take you off from the more de&s;irable ones of <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> and make your Delights
<PB N="91" REF="108">
&s;top at the <HI>Ear,</HI> which &s;hould go deeper, and be placed in the <HI>Under&s;tanding.</HI> For whenever a chear|ful Singer is in Company, adieu to all Conver&s;a|tion of an improving or intellectual Nature.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, it may expo&s;e you to <HI>Com|pany,</HI> and that not the <HI>be&s;t</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t</HI> eligible neither; and by which your <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> and your other <HI>more u&s;eful</HI> Studies, may be greatly if not wholly neglect|ed, and very po&s;&s;ibly your <HI>Health</HI> it&s;elf much im|paired.</P>
<P>In the third place, it may tend, for &s;o it natu|rally does, to <HI>enervate the Mind,</HI> and make you haunt mu&s;ical Societies, Operas and Concerts; and what Glory is it to a Gentleman if he were even a fine Performer, that he can &s;trike a String, touch a Key, or &s;ing a Song with the Grace and Com|mand of a <HI>hired Mu&s;ician?</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, Mu&s;ick, to arrive at any tolerable Pro|ficiency in it, takes up <HI>much Time,</HI> and requires &s;o much Application, as leaves but little <HI>Room,</HI> and, what is wor&s;e, when delighted in, little <HI>Inclination</HI> for other Improvements: And as Life is a <HI>&s;hort</HI> Stage, where <HI>longe&s;t,</HI> &s;urely the mo&s;t precious Mo|ments of it, ought to be better imploy'd, than in &s;o light and airy an Amu&s;ement. The Time of <HI>Youth</HI> will be &s;oon over, and that is the Time of laying the Foundation of more &s;olid Studies. The <HI>Mind,</HI> as well as the <HI>Body,</HI> will become &s;tiff by Years, and un&s;u&s;ceptible of tho&s;e Improvements, that cannot be attained, but in particular Periods of it: And, once an airy Delight engages the Faculties, a Habit is formed; and nothing but great Struggle, and ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, if <HI>that</HI> will do it, can &s;hake it off. One Part of Life is for <HI>Improvement,</HI> that is <HI>Youth;</HI> another Part is for turning that Improve|ment to &s;olid Benefits to one's Self, one's Family, or Acquaintance; that is the <HI>middle Part;</HI> another

Part carries a Retro&s;pect to a <HI>future E&s;tate:</HI> And &s;hall we lo&s;e the Time of <HI>Improvement,</HI> which can never come again; forfeit all the Benefits of it, in our <HI>Middle-life,</HI> and embitter our <HI>future Pro&s;pect,</HI> as well <HI>mundane</HI> as <HI>eternal,</HI> with Reflections on our pa&s;t Neglect of Opportunities that never can be recalled? And all for what? Why, only to be deemed for eight or ten empty Years of Life, <HI>a good Companion,</HI> as the Phra&s;e is:&mdash;Tho', perhaps, a bad <HI>Hu&s;band,</HI> a bad <HI>Father,</HI> a bad <HI>Friend,</HI> and, of cour&s;e, a bad <HI>Man!</HI></P>
<P>Some there are, who divide Life into four Stages or Opportunities.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE kind Indulgence you have always &s;hewn to your Children, makes me pre&s;ume to be|come an Advocate for my <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> tho' not for her <HI>Fault.</HI> She is very &s;en&s;ible of <HI>that,</HI> and &s;orry &s;he has offended you; but has great hopes, that Mr. <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> will prove &s;uch a careful and loving Hu&s;|band to her, as may atone for his pa&s;t Wildne&s;s, and engage your Forgivene&s;s. For all your Chil|dren are &s;en&s;ible of your paternal Kindne&s;s, and that you wi&s;h their Good more for their &s;akes, than <HI>your own.</HI></P>
<P>This makes it the more wicked to offend &s;o good a Father: But, dear Sir, be plea&s;ed to con|&s;ider, that it now cannot be helped, and that &s;he may be made by your Di&s;plea&s;ure very mi&s;erable in her own Choice; and as his Faults are owing to the Incon&s;ideration of Youth, or otherwi&s;e it would not have been a very di&s;creditable Match, had it had your Approbation; I could humbly hope, for my poor Si&s;ter's &s;ake, that you will be plea&s;ed rather to encourage his pre&s;ent good Re&s;olutions, by your kind Favour, than make him de&s;pair of a Recon|ciliation, and &s;o perhaps treat her with a Negligence, which hitherto &s;he is not apprehen&s;ive of. For he is really very fond of her, and I hope will continue &s;o. Yet is &s;he dejected for her Fault to you, and wi&s;hes, yet dreads, to have your Leave to throw her&s;elf at your Feet, to beg your Forgivene&s;s and

<P>YOU mu&s;t believe that your Si&s;ter's unadvi&s;ed Marriage, which &s;he mu&s;t know would be di&s;agreeable to me, gives me no &s;mall Concern; and yet I will a&s;&s;ure you that it ari&s;es more from my Affection for her, than any other Con&s;idera|tion. In her Education I took all the Pains and Care my Circum&s;tances would admit, and often flattered my&s;elf with the Hope that the happy Fruits of it would be made appear in her prudent Conduct. What &s;he has now done is not <HI>vicious,</HI> but <HI>indi&s;creet;</HI> for, you mu&s;t remember, that I have often declared in her Hearing, that the wild A&s;&s;er|tion of a Rake making a good Hu&s;band, was the mo&s;t dangerous Opinion a young Woman could imbibe.</P>

<P>THE Love I have always had for you, and an Unwillingne&s;s I find in my&s;elf to &s;ay any thing that may put you to Confu&s;ion, has made me take this Method of acquainting you with a &s;mall In|di&s;cretion I have often ob&s;erved in you, and which I perceive gradually to gain Ground as your Family increa&s;es.</P>

What I mean, is an immoderate Inclination to make your Spou&s;e, and your Children, the Sub|ject of Di&s;cour&s;e where-ever you are.

<P>I WAS greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at the Letter you &s;ent me la&s;t Week. I was willing to believe I &s;aw in you, for your Years, &s;o much of your late dear Mother's Temper, Prudence, and virtuous Di&s;po|&s;ition, that I refu&s;ed &s;everal advantageous Offers of changing my own Condition, purely for your &s;ake: And will you now convince me &s;o early, that I have no Return to expect from you, but that the Moment a young Fellow throws him&s;elf in your way, you have nothing el&s;e to do, but to give me Notice to provide a Fortune for you? for

that you intend to be of no further U&s;e and Ser|vice to me. This, in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> is the Meaning of your Notification. For I &s;uppo&s;e your young Man does not intend to marry you, without a Fortune. And can you then think, that a Father has nothing to do, but to confer Benefits on his Chil|dren, without being intitled to expect any Return from them?</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, I had propo&s;ed, at a proper Time, to find a Hu&s;band for you; but I thought I had yet three or four Years to come. For, con&s;ider, <HI>Sally,</HI> you are not fully Sixteen Years of Age: And a Wife, believe me, ought to have &s;ome better Qua|lifications, than an agreeable Per&s;on to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> a <HI>Hu&s;band's E&s;teem,</HI> tho' it often is enough to <HI>attract a Lover's Notice.</HI></P>
<P>Have you Experience enough, think you, di&s;|creetly to conduct the Affairs of a Family? I thought you as yet not quite capable to manage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> Hou&s;e; and I am &s;ure, my Judgment always took a Bias in your Favour.</P>

<P>Why what follow'd; for, truly, <HI>Bob,</HI> we began to tumble like rotten Sheep. As thus: The Dance was begun by that &s;ea&s;on'd Sinner <HI>Tim.

her Conduct; and the good Opinion I have long entertained of my&s;elf, makes me very &s;low in blaming my own. I would have obey'd your Orders to write to you &s;ooner, but knew not what to &s;ay; and by waiting till I began to fear you would think me negligent, I am in no better Condition. I fir&s;t declared my Regard for her in a manner I thought mo&s;t &s;uitable for that Purpo&s;e. She very encouragingly made me no An&s;wer; and when I &s;poke again upon the Subject, &s;he a&s;k'd how you did, and was glad to hear you were well. Be|ing put out of my Play, I talk'd of indifferent Things a good while, and at la&s;t fell again upon the Rea&s;on of my attending her. She order'd the Cloth to be laid, and complai&s;antly hoped I would &s;tay Sup|per. I had no more Opportunity for that time.</P>
<P>Two Days after, I repeated my Vi&s;it. She receiv|ed me at fir&s;t politely; but when I began to re&s;ume the Subject I came upon, &s;he rung for the Maid, and bad her put on the Tea-kettle. About &s;ix Vi&s;its pa&s;&s;ed before I could obtain one Word to my Bu&s;ine&s;s: And the fir&s;t Thing &s;he an&s;wer'd upon that Head was, That Length of Time was nece&s;|&s;ary to the making of an Acquaintance that mu&s;t not be either blu&s;hed at, or repented of: This &s;he &s;poke with &s;uch an Air of Gravity, as put what I would have reply'd, quite out of my Head. Yet next Vi&s;it I began again. I told her how happy I &s;hould think my&s;elf, if I could be encouraged to hope for the &s;malle&s;t Share of her Favour. But &s;he made me &s;uch an odd An&s;wer, as plainly demon&s;trated to me, that I had more of her Con|tempt than Approbation. This made me as earne&s;t as &s;he, to wave the Subject; and &s;o we went on upon the Weather, for a whole Week before; and when we had done that, we talk'd Politicks: And Admiral <HI>Vernon,</HI> and Lord <HI>Cathcart's</HI> Expedition,

So that, in &s;hort, after Two Months Study how to accompli&s;h the Happine&s;s you pointed out for me, I find my&s;elf not one &s;ingle Step advanced; for when I &s;ee her now, we both talk with &s;eeming Satisfaction, on any Subject where Love has no Part: but when that is introduced, all her ea&s;y Eloquence &s;inks into Re&s;erve.</P>

She is a Lady of fine Sen&s;e, and has had the Advantage of as fine an Education; and you mu&s;t not expect a Lady of her Prudence and Merit, will be won by general Compliments; or that her Affection will be moved by the Notion of a &s;udden and precipitate Pa&s;|&s;ion. Her Judgment mu&s;t be fir&s;t touch'd; for &s;he views Marriage as a &s;erious Thing: By it her Mo|ther was made happy, and her Si&s;ter undone.

Having made bold to declare thus much, I mu&s;t pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that a favourable Reception of this will, I am certain, make me more worthy your Notice; but your Di&s;dain would be what I believe my&s;elf incapable ever to &s;urmount. To try by idle Fallacies, and airy Compliments, to pre|vail on your Judgment, is a Folly for any Man to attempt who knows you.

<P><PB N="115" REF="132">
The fir&s;t time the <HI>hone&s;t Man</HI> came to &s;ee me, in the way you was plea&s;ed to put into his Head, was one <HI>Sunday</HI> after Sermon time: He began with telling me, what I found at <HI>my</HI> Fingers-ends; that it was very cold, and politely blow'd upon <HI>his.</HI> I immediately perceived, that his Pa&s;|&s;ion for me could not keep him warm; and in Complai&s;ance to your Recommendation, con|ducted him to the Fire-&s;ide. After he had pret|ty well rubbed Heat into his Hands, he &s;tood up with his Back to the Fire, and with his Hand behind him, held up his Coat, that he might be warm all over; and looking about him, a&s;ked with the Tranquillity of a Man a Twelve-month mar|ried, and ju&s;t come off a Journey, How all Friends did in the Country? I &s;aid, I hoped, very well; but would be glad to warm my Fingers. Cry Mercy, Madam!&mdash;And then he &s;huffled a little further from the Fire, and after two or three Hems, and a long Pau&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>I have heard, &s;aid he, a mo&s;t excellent Sermon ju&s;t now: Dr. <HI>Thomas</HI> is a fine Man truly: Did you ever hear him, Madam? No, Sir, I gene|rally go to my own Pari&s;h-Church.

knit and &s;ing P&s;alms.

<P>O, my good Aunt, what a Man is here for a Hu&s;band!

<P>I think, allowing for the ridiculous Turn your airy Wit gives to this his fir&s;t Vi&s;it, that, by your own Account, he acted like a prudent, a &s;erious, and a worthy Man, as he is, and as one that thought fla&s;hy Compliments beneath him, in &s;o &s;erious an Affair as this.</P>
<P>I think, Cou&s;in <HI>Jenny,</HI> this is not only a mighty &s;afe Way, as you call it, of travelling toward the <HI>Land of Matrimony,</HI> but to the <HI>Land of Happine&s;s,</HI> with re&s;pect as well to the <HI>next World</HI> as <HI>this.</HI> And it is to be hoped, that the <HI>better Entertainment</HI> you &s;o much wi&s;h for, on your <HI>Journey,</HI> may not lead you too much out of <HI>your Way,</HI> and divert your Mind from the principal View which you ought to have to your <HI>Journey's End.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, I could rather have wi&s;h'd, that you could bring your Mind nearer to <HI>his</HI> Standard, than that he &s;hould bring down his to your <HI>Level.</HI> And you'd have found more Satisfaction in it than you imagine, could you have brought your&s;elf to a little more of that <HI>&s;olemn Appearance,</HI> which you treat &s;o lightly, and which, I think, in <HI>him,</HI> is much more than <HI>mere Appearance.</HI></P>

<P>MY Niece de&s;ires me to acquaint you, that &s;he received your cele&s;tial Epi&s;tle la&s;t Night, as we were all &s;itting down to Supper; and &s;he leaves it to me to an&s;wer it, according to the Effects it has produced.

When, by your generous Aid, &s;he had thus rai&s;ed her&s;elf far above Mortality, &s;he began to de&s;pi&s;e our Company, and thought her Grandmother and me too highly favoured by her Pre&s;ence; and &s;poke to us in &s;uch a Tone, as made us hone&s;t Mortals amaz'd at her &s;udden Elevation.</P>

<P>THE Improvement that is vi&s;ible in your Per|&s;on, &s;ince your going to <HI>Bury,</HI> gives me much Plea&s;ure; and the dawning of fine Sen&s;e, and a
<PB N="125" REF="142">
good Judgment, that di&s;covers it&s;elf in your Con|ver&s;ation, makes me hope to &s;ee every Perfection of my Si&s;ter, your late excellent Mother, revived in you.</P>
<P>Yet one thing the Duty of a tender Uncle obliges me to blame in you; and that is, a certain Affectation that of late obtains in your Behaviour, of imitating the Manners of the other Sex, and appearing more ma&s;culine than either the amiable Softne&s;s of your Per&s;on or Sex can ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>I have been particularly offended, let me tell you, my Dear, at your <HI>new Riding-habit;</HI> which is made &s;o extravagantly in the Mode, that one cannot ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h your Sex by it. For you neither look like a <HI>mode&s;t Girl</HI> in it, nor an <HI>agree|able Boy.</HI></P>
<P>Some Conformity to the Fa&s;hion is allowable. But a cock'd Hat, a lac'd Jacket, a Fop's Peruke, what &s;trange Metamorpho&s;es do they make! And then the <HI>Air</HI> a&s;&s;umed with them, &s;o <HI>pert,</HI> and &s;o <HI>in&s;ipid,</HI> at the &s;ame time, makes, upon the whole, &s;uch a <HI>Boy-girl</HI> Figure, that I know of nothing that would become either the <HI>Air,</HI> or the <HI>Dre&s;s,</HI> but a young <HI>Italian</HI> Singer. For &s;uch an one, being neither <HI>Man</HI> nor <HI>Woman,</HI> would po&s;&s;ibly be be&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by this Hermaphrodite Ap|pearance.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I would have you remember, my Dear, that as &s;ure as any thing intrepid, free, and in a pru|dent Degree bold, becomes a Man; &s;o whatever is &s;oft, tender, and mode&s;t, renders your Sex amiable. In this one In&s;tance we do not prefer our own Likene&s;s; and the le&s;s you re&s;emble us, the more you are &s;ure to charm: For a <HI>ma&s;culine Woman</HI> is a Character as little creditable as becoming.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XCI. Letter of a Father to a Daughter, relating to Three Per&s;ons of different Characters pro|po&s;ed to him, each for her Hu&s;band. With his Recommendation of one in Years.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear <HI>Polly,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE three &s;everal Propo&s;als made me on your Account; and they are &s;o particularly circum&s;tanced, that I cannot approve of one of them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is by Mr. <HI>Aldridge,</HI> for his Son <HI>John,</HI> who, you know, is very weak in his Intellects, and &s;o apt to be mi&s;led, that he wants a <HI>Guardian</HI> for him in a <HI>Wife,</HI> and &s;o does you the Reputation to think you a proper Per&s;on for that Office. But I think, the wor&s;t Weakne&s;s in the World in a Hu&s;band is, that of <HI>Intellect;</HI> and I &s;hould &s;uffer much to have you linked to a Man who has no <HI>Head,</HI> and is, for that Rea&s;on, highly unworthy to be yours. A <HI>fooli&s;h Wife</HI> is much more tolera|ble, becau&s;e &s;he can be <HI>kept up;</HI> but a <HI>fooli&s;h Hu&s;|band</HI> will do what he plea&s;es, and go where he plea&s;es; and tho' he knew nothing el&s;e, will think he knows too much to be controuled by his Wife; and will have <HI>this</HI> Le&s;&s;on taught him by Rakes and
<PB N="127" REF="144">
Libertines, when he is capable of <HI>no other.</HI> So I did not think it nece&s;&s;ary &s;o much as to con&s;ult you about him.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is from Mr. <HI>Gough,</HI> for his Son <HI>Richard,</HI> who has run thro' &s;uch a Cour&s;e of Libertini&s;m, that he has hardly his Fellow, and has neither a <HI>&s;ound Head,</HI> nor a <HI>&s;ound Body;</HI> and is &s;o far from being reclaim'd, that his Father propo&s;es a Wife, as the <HI>la&s;t Hope,</HI> for him; and yet knows not whether he will accept of one, if one can be found that would venture upon him. So I could not think of &s;uffering my Daughter to &s;tand either to the Courte&s;y, or lie at the Mercy, of &s;o profligate a Rake: tho', it &s;eems, he <HI>vouch|&s;afes</HI> to <HI>like</HI> you better, as his Father &s;ays, than any one he ever &s;aw; which was the Rea&s;on of the old Man's Application to me.</P>
<P>The third was from Mr. <HI>Tomkins,</HI> who&s;e Nephew is as bad a <HI>Sot,</HI> as the other is a <HI>Rake;</HI> but who promi&s;es to reform, if his Uncle can procure my Con&s;ent and yours. But as you had refu&s;ed his Overtures when made to <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> without con|&s;ulting me, and for the very Rea&s;ons <HI>I</HI> &s;hould have rejected him, I would not trouble you about him; but gave a total Denial to the Reque&s;t of his Uncle, who de&s;ired that the Matter might be brought on again, by my Authority and Interpo&s;ition.</P>
<P>So, my good Girl has had hard Fortune, as one may &s;ay, in the Offers of three Per&s;ons, that it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould chu&s;e out of: One &s;o very a <HI>Fool,</HI> a &s;econd &s;o profligate a <HI>Rake,</HI> and the third &s;o vile a <HI>Sot,</HI> that there could be no Thought of any of the Three.</P>
<P>But I have a <HI>fourth</HI> Affair to mention to you, again&s;t which there can lie but one Objection; and that is, &s;ome Di&s;parity in Years. This is my good Friend Mr. <HI>Rowe;</HI> as hone&s;t a Man as ever
<PB N="128" REF="145">
liv'd; a Man of Prudence; a Man of good For|tune, and ea&s;y Circum&s;tance; Ma&s;ter of a genteel Hou&s;e and Bu&s;ine&s;s; well re&s;pected by all the World, and <HI>mo&s;t</HI> by tho&s;e who know him <HI>be&s;t;</HI> a good-natur'd Man, humane, compa&s;&s;ionate, and, tho' <HI>frugal,</HI> not a <HI>Niggard.</HI></P>
<P>Now, my dear Daughter, What think you of Mr. <HI>Rowe?</HI>&mdash;He has an high Opinion of your Prudence and Di&s;cretion; but wi&s;hes <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> that <HI>you</HI> were either Ten Years older, or <HI>he</HI> Ten Years younger.&mdash;Yet he thinks, if you can get over that Point, he could make you one of the fonde&s;t of Hu&s;bands, and that there is not any thing but he could and would oblige you in.</P>
<P>I too, my Dear, wi&s;h there was a nearer Agree|ment in <HI>Years;</HI> yet, con&s;idering the Hazards a young Woman runs, as the World goes, from <HI>Rakes, Sots,</HI> and <HI>Fools,</HI> of every Degree; con&s;idering that in this Matter, there is but <HI>one</HI> only thing to be wi&s;h'd for; and that all the <HI>grand De&s;irables</HI> of Life will be &s;o <HI>well</HI> &s;upply'd; con&s;idering too that he is a <HI>&s;ightly,</HI> a <HI>neat,</HI> a <HI>per&s;onable</HI> Man, and has good <HI>Health,</HI> good <HI>Spirits,</HI> and good <HI>Humour,</HI> and is not yet got quite at the Top of the <HI>Hill of Life.</HI> Con&s;idering all the&s;e Things, I &s;ay, I think that <HI>one</HI> Con&s;ideration might be given up for the <HI>many</HI> other <HI>more</HI> material ones, which would be &s;o well &s;upply'd in this Match.</P>
<P>Say, my dear Daughter, &s;ay freely, what you think. You'll much oblige me, if you can get this Matter over. But if you cannot, (and be &s;o happy as I wi&s;h you)&mdash;why then&mdash;I don't know what to &s;ay&mdash;But I mu&s;t&mdash;I think&mdash;acquie&s;ce.

<P>I AM far from taking ami&s;s what you have writ|ten, in An&s;wer to my Recommendation of my worthy Friend Mr. <HI>Rowe;</HI> and I am &s;ure, if I was to &s;hew him your Letter, he would never permit you to be urged more on this Head. But, my Dear, I own my Wi&s;hes and my Heart are engaged in <HI>his,</HI> &s;hall I &s;ay, or in <HI>your own</HI> Favour? And I would hope, that notwith&s;tanding all you have written, your good Sen&s;e, and that Di&s;cretion for which you have been hitherto &s;o de&s;ervedly noted, may, on ma|ture Reflection, enable you to overcome the Ob|jection that would be in&s;uperable to lighter and airier Minds of your Sex.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="148">
Such is the Profligatene&s;s of the Generality of young Fellows of the pre&s;ent Age, that I own I look into the World with Affrightment, at the Ri&s;ques which a virtuous young Woman has to encounter with on a Change of Condition, which makes me dwell upon the Point with the greater Earne&s;t|ne&s;s. And you know, my Dear, I can have no Motive but your Good.</P>
<P>Then, Child, con&s;ider the Reputation this Match, to all who know Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI>'s Worth, will bring to your <HI>Prudence,</HI> and even to your <HI>Sex.</HI> For it is as much Credit to a <HI>young Lady</HI> to marry a worthy Man, <HI>older than her&s;elf,</HI> as it is <HI>Di&s;credit</HI> for an <HI>old Woman</HI> to marry a young Man. Does my <HI>Polly</HI> take my Meaning? The Ca&s;e is plain. Be&s;ides, no-body thinks Ten or Twelve Years Difference in a Man's Age any thing out of the way. So, my Dear, it is not <HI>Twenty</HI> Years Odds; it is only <HI>Ten</HI> at <HI>mo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Then, again, he is a good-natur'd Man; there's a great deal in <HI>that,</HI> you know.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, my Dear, it is my good Opinion of your <HI>Prudence,</HI> that makes me endeavour to per|&s;uade you to this. And I could be glad, methinks, to find, that I have not too high a Notion of <HI>your</HI> Di&s;cretion, in the Preference I am willing to give it to that of all the young Ladies I know.</P>
<P>But if I am mi&s;taken, I mean, if you cannot get over this <HI>one</HI> Difficulty, I &s;hall be apt to think, &s;o &s;urmountable does it &s;eem to me, that you have &s;een &s;omebody you like, and are prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd. Yet I cannot believe that neither, becau&s;e you know I have &s;o tender a Regard for your own Option, that you would have made me acquainted with it.</P>
<P>Yet, after all, far be it from me to compel your Inclinations! But if you &s;hould be &s;o happy as to
<PB N="132" REF="149">
think with me, that the many valuable Qualitics Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI> is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, are &s;carcely to be hoped for in a younger Man, as the World now goes, you would make me very happy; and I am per|&s;uaded you will never repent your Choice.</P>
<P>One thing more let me urge, my Dear; for you &s;ee how my Heart's upon it. How many very virtuous young Maidens have married, for the &s;ake of <HI>Riches</HI> only, a Man much older, much more di&s;agreeable, wa&s;pi&s;h, humour&s;ome, di&s;ea&s;ed, decrepit, and yet have lived Years without Re|proach, and made them&s;elves not unhappy! And will not my dear Daughter do as much to <HI>oblige her Father,</HI> (and where Health, Good-nature, Wi&s;dom, Di&s;cretion, and great Circum&s;tances meet to <HI>enforce</HI> the Argument) as others would do, where not one of the&s;e Advantages are in the Ca&s;e, except the &s;ingle Article of <HI>Riches?</HI> Only then, my Dear, let Mr. <HI>Rowe</HI> attend you, two or three times, before you ab&s;olutely &s;et your&s;elf again&s;t him. And, as I hope your Affections are intirely di&s;engaged, you will &s;oon &s;ee whether his Conver&s;ation or Propo&s;als will not incline you in his Favour, con&s;idering all things; that is to &s;ay, con&s;idering the <HI>one</HI> thing AGAINST him, and the <HI>many</HI> FOR him. And if it cannot be, I will intirely acquie&s;ce, being ever &s;tudious of your Happine&s;s, as becomes</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XCIV. To a rich Widow Lady with Children, di&s;|&s;uading her from marrying a Widower of meaner Degree, who has Children al&s;o.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with &s;ome Reluctance, and great Re&s;pect, that I prevail on my&s;elf to give you this Trouble. The frequent Vi&s;its Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> makes you, and the Airs that Gentleman gives him&s;elf, have given Birth to a Report, that a Treaty of Marriage be|tween you is on foot; and that, in all Probability, it will be &s;oon brought to Effect.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on</HI> is not to be blam'd, to endeavour to procure for his Wife a Lady of your Prudence, good Character, and Fortune; but whe|ther you will be able to avoid the Cen&s;ure of the World, if you chu&s;e <HI>him</HI> for a Hu&s;band, is another Point, which greatly concerns you to con&s;ider of, and affects me, and all who wi&s;h you well.</P>
<P>His Fortune, Madam, is not equal to yours, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be better than the World reports it: He has Children: So have you. What Inconvenien|cies may not ari&s;e from hence? E&s;pecially, as he is not thought to be one of the be&s;t and &s;moothe&s;t|temper'd Men in the World.&mdash;His Character is not equal in any re&s;pect, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, (for I would not detract from any Man's Merit) to that of your late good Spou&s;e, my dear Friend; who would have been much grieved, if he had had but the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ion, that the Man he would not have accompany'd with, &s;hould &s;ucceed him in his Bed.</P>
<P>Far be it from me, dear Madam, if you are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, as to wi&s;h to hinder you from a Change

of Condition with a &s;uitable Per&s;on! But as your late Spou&s;e left <HI>his</HI> and <HI>your</HI> Children &s;o much in your Power, methinks you &s;hould take e&s;pecial Care, how and to whom you communicate any Part of that Power, and thereby give a <HI>Right</HI> to controul not only <HI>them,</HI> but your&s;elf. Mu&s;t <HI>he</HI> not be par|tial to <HI>his own</HI> Children? And will he not expect, that your Complai&s;ance to him &s;hould make <HI>you</HI> &s;o too; or, at lea&s;t, be his Childrens Behaviour what it will, that it &s;hall induce you to put them upon a <HI>Par</HI> with your own? His Daughters will be Spies upon your Conduct, and, be you ever &s;o kind to them, will always &s;u&s;pect your Partiality to your own, and treat you as their <HI>Mother-in-law;</HI> and their Father will believe all they &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t, for <HI>that</HI> very Rea&s;on, and becau&s;e he will <HI>judge,</HI> tho' perhaps not <HI>allow for,</HI> that you <HI>ought</HI> to pre|fer <HI>your own</HI> to <HI>his:</HI> And this will be the Source of perpetual Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es between you.

<P>No doubt but you may make your own Condi|tions with Mr. <HI>Clark&s;on.</HI> He will be glad to call you and your Fortune <HI>his,</HI> upon any Terms: But con|&s;ider, Madam, how difficult it may be, whatever Articles you make, for a good Wife, who has been accu&s;tom'd to think <HI>her</HI> Intere&s;t the <HI>&s;ame</HI> with that of her <HI>Hu&s;band,</HI> to refu&s;e to his <HI>Importunities,</HI> and perhaps to his <HI>Conveniency,</HI> if not <HI>Nece&s;&s;ities,</HI> tho&s;e Communications of Fortune which you may re|&s;erve in your own Power, when they will make him <HI>ea&s;ier</HI> in Circum&s;tance, and <HI>more complai&s;ant</HI> in Temper: And how hard it will be to deny a Man <HI>any thing,</HI> to whom you have given your <HI>Per|&s;on,</HI> and to whom you have vowed <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Obe|dience.</HI>

But if you &s;hould have the Re&s;olution to <HI>refu&s;e</HI> him, what he may not be backward to <HI>a&s;k,</HI> do you think your&s;elf &s;o well able to bear that <HI>In|difference,</HI> if not <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> which &s;uch a Refu&s;al may occa&s;ion?

<P>If, Madam, you are bent upon a Change of Con|dition, your Friends would wi&s;h fir&s;t, that you will be plea&s;ed ab&s;olutely to a&s;certain the Fortunes of your Children, according to the <HI>De&s;ign</HI> and <HI>Will</HI> of their <HI>dear Father,</HI> as far as may <HI>legally</HI> be done, either by chu&s;ing Tru&s;tees for them, or by &s;uch other way as &s;hall put it out of a <HI>new</HI> Hu&s;band's Power to hurt them: And when he &s;hall know this <HI>is done,</HI> you will have a better Te&s;timony of his Affection, as he will know what <HI>is,</HI> and what <HI>is not</HI> yours, and can hope for no more, becau&s;e it is not in your Power to give more. But how much more is it to be wi&s;hed, for your own &s;ake, as well as your Chil|drens, that if you do change, it may be with a Per&s;on who has <HI>no</HI> Children? And then what <HI>other</HI> Children may be the Re&s;ults of your <HI>new Marriage,</HI> they will be <HI>your own</HI> as well as <HI>his,</HI> and &s;o be <HI>more properly</HI> intitled to your <HI>Care</HI> and your <HI>Kindne&s;s,</HI> than any Man's Children by <HI>another Wife</HI> can be.</P>

By this means, Madam, mo&s;t of the Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es we every Day &s;ee in Families, where are <HI>two Sorts</HI> of Children, will be prevented; or perhaps your pre&s;ent Children will be grown up, and out of the way, before the other can <HI>interfere</HI> e&s;&s;entially with them; or if <HI>not,</HI> they will be <HI>naturalized,</HI> as one may &s;ay, to <HI>each other;</HI> and having the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Mother, who has an <HI>equal</HI> Intere&s;t in them <HI>all,</HI> will <HI>expect</HI> and <HI>allow for</HI> an <HI>equal</HI> Exertion of Tenderne&s;s and Favour to <HI>all.</HI></P>

<P><HI>In&s;tructions to young Orphan Ladies, as well as others, how to judge of Propo&s;als of Marriage made to them without their Guardians or Friends Con&s;ent, by their Milaners, Mantua-makers, or other Go-betweens.</HI></P>
<P>A YOUNG Orphan Lady, of an independent Fortune, receivable at Age, or Day of Marri|age, will hardly &s;ail of &s;everal Attempts to engage her Affections. And the following general Rules and In&s;tructions will be of U&s;e to her on the&s;e Oc|ca&s;ions:</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="154">
In the fir&s;t place, &s;he ought to mi&s;tru&s;t all tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;eek to &s;et her again&s;t her Guardian, or tho&s;e Relations to whom her Fortune or Per&s;on is intru&s;ted: And, next, to be apprehen&s;ive of all &s;uch as privately want to be introduced to her, and who avoid treating with her Guardian fir&s;t for his Con&s;ent. For &s;he may be a&s;&s;ur'd, that if a young Man has Propo&s;als to make, which he him|&s;elf thinks would be accepted by a Per&s;on of <HI>Years</HI> and <HI>Experience,</HI> he will apply in a regular way to her Friends; but if he has not, he will hope to engage the young Lady's Affections by the means of her <HI>Milaner,</HI> her <HI>Mantua-maker,</HI> or her <HI>Ser|vant,</HI> and &s;o by Bribes and Promi&s;es endeavour to make his way to her Favour, in order to take Ad|vantage of her Youth and Inexperience: For this is the con&s;tant Method of <HI>Fortune-hunters,</HI> to which many a worthy young Lady of good Sen&s;e and good Fortune has owed her utter Ruin.</P>
<P>The following are generally the Methods taken by this Set of De&s;igners:</P>
<P>The&s;e indu&s;trious Go-betweens, who hope to make a Market of a young Lady's Affections, generally by Letter, or Word of Mouth, if they have Opportunity, &s;et forth to the young Lady:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That there is a certain young Gentleman of <HI>great Merit,</HI> of a <HI>hand&s;ome Per&s;on,</HI> and <HI>fine Ex|pectations,</HI> or <HI>pro&s;perous Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> who is fallen deeply in Love with her. And very probably, the young Lady, having no bad Opinion of her|&s;elf, and loving to be admired, believes it very ea&s;ily."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he has &s;een her at <HI>Church,</HI> or the <HI>Opera,</HI> the <HI>Play,</HI> the <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> &amp;c. and is impatient to make known his Pa&s;&s;ion to her."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="155"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he is unwilling to apply to her <HI>Guardian,</HI> till he <HI>knows</HI> how his Addre&s;s will be received by <HI>her&s;elf.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That, be&s;ides, it may very probably be the Ca&s;e, that her Guardian may form Ob&s;tacles, which may not be rea&s;onable on <HI>her Part</HI> to give into."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That, if he has <HI>Daughters</HI> of his own, he would perhaps rather &s;ee them marry'd <HI>fir&s;t.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he may not care to part with her <HI>Fortune,</HI> and the <HI>Reputation</HI> and <HI>Convenience</HI> the <HI>Manage|ment</HI> of it may give him."</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That, therefore, it would be be&s;t, that her Guardian &s;hould know <HI>nothing</HI> of the Matter, till &s;he &s;aw whether &s;he could approve the Gen|tleman or not."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That even <HI>then</HI> &s;he might <HI>encourage</HI> his Ad|dre&s;s, or <HI>di&s;ccountenance</HI> it as &s;he <HI>plea&s;ed.</HI>"</Q></P>

<P>This kind of Introduction ought always to be &s;u&s;pected by a prudent young Lady. She ought with <HI>Warmth</HI> and <HI>Re&s;entment</HI> to di&s;courage the <HI>offi|cious Propo&s;er.</HI> She ought to acquaint her,</P>

<P>Nor is the Con&s;equence of this Defect confin'd to the School-age, as I may call it; for as they grow up, they will be look'd upon in an equally di&s;couraging and di&s;advantageous Light, by all who conver&s;e with them: Which mu&s;t of cour&s;e throw them into the Company of the Dregs of Man|kind; for how will they be able to conver&s;e or corre&s;pond with tho&s;e who&s;e Acquaintance it is
<PB N="169" REF="186">
mo&s;t worth their while to cultivate? And indeed they will probably be &s;o con&s;cious of their Unfit|ne&s;s to bear a Part in worthy Conver&s;ation, that, to keep them&s;elves in Countenance, they will, of their own Accord, &s;hun the <HI>better</HI> Company, and a&s;&s;ociate with the <HI>wor&s;t:</HI> And what <HI>may</HI> be the Con&s;equence of this, a wi&s;e Man, and a good Father, would tremble to think of, e&s;pecially when he has to reflect upon him&s;elf as the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of it, let it be what it will.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, it is to be con&s;ider'd, that without a tolerable Education, they can be only fit for mean and &s;ordid Employments.

<P>And with regard more immediately to <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> how can you expect, when they know you could do better for them, but that their Behaviour to <HI>you</HI> will be of a Piece with the re&s;t? for if they are not poli&s;h'd by Learning, but are left to a kind of <HI>In&s;tinct</HI> rather, is it to be expected, that they &s;hould behave to <HI>you,</HI> and their <HI>Mother,</HI> with that Sen&s;e of their Obligations which Learning incul|cates?

<P>I MUST take up my Pen and write, tho' perhaps you will only &s;coff at me for &s;o doing; but when I have &s;aid what I have to &s;ay, then I &s;hall have ea&s;ed my Mind, and will endeavour to forget you for ever. I have had &s;o many Cautions given me again&s;t the fal&s;e Hearts of Men, and was &s;o often told how they will vow and for&s;wear them|&s;elves, that I ought to have been on my Guard, that's true: And indeed, &s;o <HI>I was</HI> a great while: You know it well. But you courted me &s;o long, vowed &s;o earne&s;tly, and &s;eem'd &s;o much in Love with me, that it was fir&s;t <HI>Pity</HI> in me, that made me li&s;ten to you; and, Oh! this <HI>na&s;ty Pity,</HI> how &s;oon did it bring&mdash;But I won't &s;ay <HI>Love</HI> neither. I thought, if all the young Men in the World be&s;ides proved fal&s;e, yet it was impo&s;&s;ible <HI>you</HI> &s;hould. Ah! poor &s;illy Creature that I was, to think, tho' every body flatter'd me with being &s;ightly enough, I could hold a Heart &s;o &s;ordidly bent on <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> as I always &s;aw <HI>yours</HI> to be; but that, thought I, tho' 'tis a Meanne&s;s <HI>I don't like,</HI> yet will it be a Security of his making a frugal Hu&s;band in an Age &s;o fruitful of <HI>Spendthrifts.</HI></P>
<P>But at length it has proved, that you can prefer <HI>Polly Bambridge,</HI> and leave <HI>poor me,</HI> only becau&s;e &s;he has a greater Portion than I have.</P>
<P>I &s;ay nothing again&s;t <HI>Polly.</HI> I wi&s;h <HI>her</HI> well. Indeed I do. And I wi&s;h <HI>you</HI> no Harm neither. But as you knew <HI>Polly before,</HI> why could you not have made to your&s;elf a Merit with <HI>her,</HI> without

<P>But as to my&s;elf, Sir, Why &s;hould you make a poor Creature unhappy in the Di&s;plea&s;ure of all her Friends at pre&s;ent, and &s;till more unhappy, if, to avoid that, &s;he gives up her <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> where &s;he can|not be&s;tow her <HI>Heart?</HI> If you love me, as you profe&s;s, let me a&s;k you, Sir, Is it for <HI>my &s;ake,</HI> or is it for <HI>your own?</HI>&mdash;If for <HI>mine,</HI> how can it be, when I mu&s;t be mi&s;erable, if I am forced to marry where I cannot love?&mdash;If for <HI>your own,</HI> reflect, Sir, on the Selfi&s;hne&s;s of your Love, and judge if it de&s;erves from me the Return you wi&s;h.</P>

<P>I Under&s;tand with great Grief of Heart, that your Ma&s;ter has made &s;ome Attempts on your Virtue, and yet that you &s;tay with him. God grant that you have not already yielded to his ba&s;e De&s;ires!

And if he carries it better, and more civil, at pre&s;ent, it is only the more certainly to undo you when he attacks you next. Con&s;ider, my dear Child, your Reputation is all you have to tru&s;t to.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are plea&s;ed to inform me of your Thoughts in relation to a Change of your Condition, and to command me to give you freely my Opinion of the Conveniencies and Inconveniencies, that may follow from the Inequality of Years between you, and the young Lady you think of making your &s;econd Wife. Indeed, I am &s;o much con|cerned for your Happine&s;s, that had I heard of &s;uch your Intention, and had not your Commands to be free on this Head, I think I &s;hould have run
<PB N="183" REF="200">
the Ri&s;que of being thought impertinent and offi|cious, rather than not have expo&s;tulated with you on this Occa&s;ion. My Objections, Sir, are not &s;o much to the Gaiety of the Lady, as to her Youth, and the Children you have already by your late excellent Lady: And when you remember, that Mi&s;s <HI>Fanny,</HI> your elde&s;t Daughter, is near as old as the Lady you think to make her Mother, I beg, Sir, you will con&s;ider how your Reputation, as to Prudence, will &s;uffer in the Eye of the World <HI>without you,</HI> as well as the Look it will have to your <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Dome&s;ticks.</HI></P>
<P>Nature, Ju&s;tice, Decency, and every Branch of human Prudence, plead &s;trongly again&s;t the Union of lively Youth with maturer Years. <HI>Her</HI> Temper may be very agreeable: So indeed is <HI>yours</HI>&mdash;But may they be &s;o to <HI>each other,</HI> when they meet together in &s;o clo&s;e an Union? You are <HI>yet</HI> ble&s;t with a good State of <HI>Health;</HI> but can you expect, that it will be <HI>always</HI> &s;o?&mdash;Or rather, will not <HI>every Year</HI> take from <HI>your</HI> Con&s;titution, what it will add to <HI>hers,</HI> for &s;everal Years to come? Your Years make <HI>you</HI> &s;erious and &s;olemn, and you are pa&s;t a <HI>Reli&s;h</HI> for tho&s;e Plea&s;ures and Amu&s;e|ments, which are but &s;uitable to <HI>hers,</HI> and which at the <HI>&s;ame Age</HI> you your&s;elf delighted in.

<P>If you cannot join in the <HI>innocent Gaieties</HI> which you have long <HI>di&s;u&s;ed,</HI> it would be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, cruel, to <HI>deprive</HI> a young Lady of her Share of them,

at an Age that will naturally make her <HI>expect</HI> and <HI>require</HI> them: And yet will not even <HI>innocent</HI> Liberties be Matter of Reproach to <HI>her,</HI> and Un|ea&s;ine&s;s to <HI>you,</HI> if &s;he takes them without you? And would you chu&s;e to bear her Company, and indulge a <HI>young-old</HI> Ta&s;te, for gay Scenes long contemn'd, and &s;o appear in a Light, to all that beheld you together, either as her <HI>Father,</HI> or her <HI>jealous Keeper,</HI> and make it look to the World as if you <HI>your&s;elf</HI> doubted her Virtue out of your own <HI>Pre&s;ence?</HI> Suppo&s;e the Scene at a gallant Comedy, that &s;prightly free Joke which will make <HI>her</HI> &s;mile, will make <HI>you</HI> frown; and &s;o on in every other Scene of Life and Amu&s;ement between you.

<P>Your Fortune, 'tis true, is &s;o con&s;iderable, that you may amply provide for <HI>all</HI> your Children, and yet make it worth a young Lady's while, who would &s;tudy her <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> preferably to any <HI>other</HI> Con&s;ideration, to oblige you: But, Sir, let me a&s;k you, Can you, who lived &s;o happily with your <HI>late dear Lady,</HI> and had &s;uch con&s;tant Proofs of her <HI>inviolable</HI> Affection to your Per&s;on, content your&s;elf with a <HI>counterfeit</HI> Pa&s;&s;ion, a mere <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> Affection in a <HI>Wife?</HI> And can you think, that &s;o <HI>young</HI> a Lady can love you, like <HI>her</HI> who grew on in Life, in Hope, in De&s;ires <HI>with you;</HI> and who, from a reciprocal Youth pa&s;&s;ed agreeably together, grew <HI>equally</HI> mature, and had <HI>both</HI> but <HI>one</HI> View between you; to wit, a young Family growing up, the <HI>common</HI> Offspring of your <HI>mutual</HI> Affe|ctions; and who were the <HI>binding,</HI> and, &s;o long as her Life la&s;ted, the <HI>indi&s;&s;oluble</HI> Cement of your <HI>Loves</HI> and your <HI>Intere&s;ts?</HI>&mdash;If &s;he <HI>can,</HI> &s;he will be

<P>I WILL now take the Liberty to continue my Subject, and my humble Expo&s;tulations upon it: And I will &s;uppo&s;e two Ca&s;es very, if not equally probable; to wit, that you <HI>may,</HI> or may <HI>not,</HI> have Children by your new Lady; and to judge in both Ca&s;es, how the Happine&s;s of your remaining Life may be affected by either. In the fir&s;t place, if you &s;hould have Children by her, (to &s;ay nothing of the Mi&s;under&s;tandings and Jea|lou&s;ies
<PB N="186" REF="203">
this may create between your Lady, and your pre&s;ent Children, which may greatly affect your own Happine&s;s) are you &s;o well able to &s;up|port, at <HI>the&s;e</HI> Years, with Credit and Satisfaction, that Character which &s;o peculiarly befits a <HI>young</HI> Hu&s;band to a <HI>young</HI> Wife? And will it not natu|rally &s;trike you, that your own Children by <HI>that</HI> time will make a <HI>better</HI> Figure in &s;uch a Circum|&s;tance than your&s;elf? Will you be &s;o well able to go thro' the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Troubles, the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Anxieties, the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Hopes, Fears, and Affections, both to the pregnant Mother, and afterwards to the Infant Progeny, that you have &s;o <HI>happily</HI> got over? And will not what was then called <HI>laudable Love,</HI> be now deemed <HI>Dotage</HI> and <HI>Uxoriou&s;ne&s;s?</HI></P>
<P>Providence &s;eems to have de&s;ign'd the <HI>youthful</HI> Portion of a Man's Life, for mutual Endearments, and Propagation of his Family; the <HI>maturer</HI> Part, for Education, Coun&s;el or Advice. And will you, Sir, <HI>invert</HI> the De&s;ign of it? Will you <HI>call back</HI> the Days of <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> into the Years of <HI>Intellect;</HI> watch over the Baby in the <HI>Cradle,</HI> when you &s;hould form the Mind of the <HI>grown Per&s;on?</HI>&mdash;How unequal will you be to this Part, to what you <HI>once</HI> were?&mdash;As you will not have the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Di&s;po&s;itions about you, you cannot have the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Joy at a plea&s;ing Incident; but will have po&s;&s;ibly a <HI>&s;uperadded</HI> Weight of Sorrow on any &s;ad Event, as <HI>Years</HI> will have <HI>added</HI> to your <HI>Reflection,</HI> as <HI>Expe|rience</HI> will have <HI>contracted</HI> your <HI>Hope,</HI> and as you will have <HI>&s;een</HI> the Vanity of all worldly Expectations.</P>
<P>Then, my dear Sir, con&s;ider, if you &s;hould even get over this <HI>re&s;umed</HI> Province happily, and have no material Unea&s;ine&s;s from the Lady, on the Account I have intimated to you: Is it not too probable, that you may not live to &s;ee this young Race brought up? And if you &s;hould, what Ani|mo&s;ities,
<PB N="187" REF="204">
what Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es may not en&s;ue, from the different Intere&s;ts into which your Family will be divided? And it may, moreover, be po&s;&s;ible for you to have Grandchildren older than &s;ome of your own by your new Lady.</P>
<P>But if we &s;uppo&s;e, that the <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> for this may not happen, will the Matter be mended by it?&mdash;All young Ladies expect and wi&s;h for Children, when they marry.

Childbed <HI>matronizes</HI> the giddie&s;t Spirits, and brings them to Reflection &s;ooner than any other Event. Its Con&s;equences fill up the Time, and introduce different Scenes of Plea&s;ure and Amu&s;ement in the Mind of a Lady. It draws her Attention to more <HI>&s;erious</HI> Affairs, it <HI>dome&s;ticates</HI> her, as I may &s;ay, and makes her a&s;&s;ociate with graver Per&s;ons, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ame Scenes of Life. But where this is <HI>not,</HI> &s;he <HI>continues</HI> her youthful and giddy Acquaintance, <HI>cla&s;&s;es</HI> her&s;elf as to her <HI>Company</HI> and <HI>Diver&s;ions,</HI> as if in the <HI>&s;ingle</HI> State &s;till, and looks for Amu&s;ements <HI>out of her|&s;elf,</HI> and <HI>out of your Hou&s;e:</HI> And you will be obliged to connive at a good deal more than you otherwi&s;e would, becau&s;e the Difference of Years will give as much <HI>Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> to <HI>you,</HI> as it will <HI>Pre&s;umption</HI> to <HI>her;</HI> and if there be any Grievance between you, &s;he'll think, after all you can do, it is of <HI>her</HI> Side.

<HEAD>LETTER CXLII. Again&s;t a Second Marriage, where there are Children on <HI>both</HI> Sides.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU a&s;k my Opinion as to the Thoughts you have entertained of making your Addre&s;&s;es to the Widow <HI>Lockyer.</HI> Do you really a&s;k it with an Intent to take it? Or, like the Generality of the World, only in hopes that my Judgment falling in
<PB N="189" REF="206">
with your own, may be a kind of Ju&s;tification or Excu&s;e for what you intend to do, and are, per|haps, already re&s;olved upon? If &s;o, what do you do, but lay a Snare for me, which may put an End to our Friend&s;hip? For Men lea&s;t of all bear Con|troul or Contradiction in Points of this Nature, when their Hearts are actually determined; and then Indifference begins, and Di&s;gu&s;t ends the be&s;t|cemented Friend&s;hips.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the Truth, I never was a Friend to Second Marriages, where there are Children on one Side, and a Likelihood of more; but, e&s;pecially, where there are Children on <HI>both.</HI> I have nothing to &s;ay, as to the Per&s;on or Character of the Lady. You, whom it mo&s;t concerns, are well &s;atisfy'd of both, or you would not have gone &s;o far, as to a&s;k a Friend's Advice on this Occa&s;ion: But &s;ince you do put it to me, I will throw a few Rea&s;ons together, which have always had Weight with me on the&s;e Occa&s;ions; and I hope, you'll not think the wor&s;e of your Friend, if he happen to differ a little from your own Judgment.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, in the Ca&s;e you put, That the Circum&s;tances on both Sides, are pretty equal. That there is no great Di&s;parity in Years. That &s;he has Three Children, and you have Four; a round Family, however, when they come toge|ther! That &s;he is very fond of her Children, and you, at <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> of yours. That you are not an ill-temper'd Man, and &s;he is a good-temper'd Wo|man; and was a loving Wife to her late Spou&s;e, as you were an affectionate Hu&s;band to yours. Well, &s;o far is very well, and, you'll think perhaps, very promi&s;ing of a happy Union; and po&s;&s;ibly you may think right; at lea&s;t you have much better Grounds for it, than many that do marry upon much wor&s;e and more unequal Pro&s;pects.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="207">
But con&s;ider, Sir, what Security have you, that Per&s;ons who have been always good-temper'd, when they have nothing to thwart or try their Temper, will be &s;till &s;o, when they have &s;ome|thing that will?&mdash;Here, at the very Thre&s;hold of this Adventure, is a Cau&s;e of great Trial; a Trial which neither of you had before, and con|&s;equently, which neither of you know how you &s;hall behave in: She loves <HI>her</HI> Children. So &s;he ought. You love <HI>yours.</HI> It is right &s;o to do. But &s;ee you not, before I &s;peak, that this laudable <HI>&s;eparate</HI> Love of <HI>either,</HI> may become matter of great Unea&s;ine&s;s to <HI>both?</HI> You cannot, either of you, po&s;&s;ibly expect more than common Civility, and out&s;ide Kindne&s;s, from the other, <HI>&s;he</HI> to <HI>yours, you</HI> to <HI>hers.</HI> And it will be happy enough if this Ta&s;k do not &s;ufficiently try the Di&s;cretion of <HI>both.</HI></P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, my Friend, but you mu&s;t have very different Views on each other&mdash;A pretty Pro|&s;pect to &s;et out with in a matrimonial Adventure! Her Prai&s;es of her own Children will be very &s;in|cere and lavi&s;h. Her Prai&s;es of yours, if &s;he <HI>ever</HI> prai&s;es, will be very &s;u&s;picious and &s;paring. And perhaps you mu&s;t be as di&s;creet as po&s;&s;ible, in the Prai&s;es of your own. The very Cloaths each wear, the Victuals they eat, nay, the very Looks of either Parent, as they &s;hall appear kind to their own, or re&s;erved to the other's, will afford room for in|ward Heart-burnings, if not outward Janglings. I have &s;een many In&s;tances of the&s;e kinds.</P>
<P>Their different Capacities; one &s;hall take their Learning, another not&mdash;Their different Tempers; one &s;hall be mild, another in&s;ulting: one &s;mooth, another rough&mdash;Their different Ages; which will make one dictate, while the other will not be pre&s;cribed to&mdash;Will all afford Cau&s;e of Dif|ference; and when they come to an Age fit for

&s;etting them out in the World; if Boys, to Ap|prentice; You put <HI>Jackey</HI> to a better Trade than <HI>Tommy,</HI> and give more Money with him! And yet one Trade or Ma&s;ter may apparently de&s;erve or require it; the other, not. If Girls, in Matri|mony; Why &s;hould <HI>Bet&s;ey</HI> be married before <HI>Thoma&s;ine?</HI>&mdash;Let the Elde&s;t go fir&s;t!

<P>Then will &s;he actually, or you will &s;u&s;pect it, (and that is as bad to your Peace) be con&s;tantly <HI>progging,</HI> as the Women call it, for her Children, in order to make a private Pur&s;e for them, on any Occa&s;ion that may happen, or in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hall outlive you.</P>
<P>And if there be a <HI>third</HI> Race of Children from this Marriage, wor&s;e and wor&s;e &s;till. Then the two former Sets, if they never joined together before, now will make a common Cau&s;e, in this &s;ingle Point, again&s;t the new Race; and mu&s;t not this double your own and your Wife's Comforts, think you?&mdash;Then mu&s;t you be glad to le&s;&s;en your Family at home, that you may le&s;&s;en the Number of &s;o many Spies and Enemies to your Repo&s;e. The Boys mu&s;t be hurry'd out to the fir&s;t Thing that offers for them, whether &s;uitable or un&s;uitable to their Genius or Capacity; and they generally thrive accordingly: The Girls to the fir&s;t Man that will take them, whether he can provide for them or not, as he ought; and after a while they may come back to you, tho' fitted out with a great Expence, quite de&s;titute and undone, with a farther Increa&s;e to your Family; the too frequent Con&s;equences of precipitate Marriages. And then
<PB N="192" REF="209">
will a new Scene commence; for all the unprovided-for, will join again&s;t the poor unhappy one.</P>
<P>This, you'll &s;ay, is looking a great way forward. It is &s;o. And what may never happen. Po&s;&s;ibly it never may, as to the la&s;t Ca&s;e; but as it too often has happen'd, and daily does happen, a wi&s;e Man will think a little about it, while it is in his Power to prevent it all.</P>
<P>I have touch'd but upon a few of the Con&s;e|quences that may too probably follow from a new Engagement. Yet, I believe, the&s;e, if you are <HI>not</HI> ab&s;olutely determin'd, will make you think a little; if you <HI>are,</HI> why then, all the Rea|&s;ons that can be urged will &s;ignify nothing. And in this Ca&s;e, you &s;hould not have laid a Snare for me to di&s;oblige a Per&s;on who is to &s;tep in be|tween your Friend&s;hip and mine, and who will look upon me, if &s;he knows my Mind, (as very probably &s;he will; for I hardly ever knew a Secret of this kind kept) as her Enemy, and &s;o create a Coolne&s;s and Indifference between us, which you cannot help if you would. For if ever it be &s;o, and your <HI>Lady</HI> receives me, in a way that I have not been u&s;ed to in your <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> I &s;hall be very &s;hy of vi&s;iting either you or her.</P>
<P>If you require it, and it will have any Effect upon you, I can enter &s;till farther into this Subject; but I fan&s;y I have &s;aid enough, and perhaps more than you'll thank me for. But be that as it will, I have an&s;wer'd your Reque&s;t; and &s;hewn you, (peradventure, at the Expence of my Di&s;cretion) that I am, in all Things,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXLIII. Again&s;t a &s;econd Marriage, where there are Chil|dren on <HI>one</HI> Side, and a Likelihood of <HI>more.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are inclined, you tell me, to give your <HI>Children</HI> a <HI>Mother,</HI> in&s;tead of the good one they have lo&s;t; or rather, in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> you &s;hould have &s;aid, <HI>your&s;elf</HI> a <HI>Wife,</HI> to &s;upply your <HI>own Lo&s;s:</HI> And you a&s;k my Opinion on the Sub|ject, without naming the Per&s;on, only intimating, that &s;he is a maiden Lady, no more than Seven Years younger than your&s;elf, and has a pretty middling Fortune.</P>
<P>I am glad you have not named the Lady; for now I &s;hall &s;tand clear of any Imputation of per|&s;onal Prejudice, let me &s;ay what I will. I will therefore freely tell you my Mind, that I am al|ways again&s;t &s;econd Marriages, where there are Children on one or both Sides, and likely to be more: Unle&s;s there are &s;uch worldly Rea&s;ons as make it ab&s;olutely prudent for a Per&s;on to marry to e&s;tabli&s;h his Circum&s;tances. This is not your Ca&s;e: For you are very ea&s;y in the World; and be&s;ides, the Ladies of this Age are &s;o brought up, that a Man mu&s;t not look for very extraordinary A&s;&s;i&s;t|ances in a Wife, with relation to her <HI>own</HI> Chil|dren, much le&s;s the Children of <HI>another</HI> Woman. Well, but <HI>this</HI> Lady is highly prudent, good-hu|mour'd, an excellent Oeconomi&s;t, and what not! And &s;o they are <HI>all,</HI> my Friend; or at lea&s;t, we are apt to per&s;uade our&s;elves &s;o, before they are marry'd.</P>
<P>But we'll &s;uppo&s;e her all you &s;ay, and all you think; yet &s;he will hardly, I pre&s;ume, be dive&s;ted
<PB N="194" REF="211">
of the Pa&s;&s;ions common to human Nature. Can you expect, that tho' you give your Children a Mo|ther, you give them an <HI>own</HI> Mother? She may have Prudence enough to do what <HI>&s;he</HI> will think her Duty by them, but mu&s;t &s;he not be her own Judge, of what that is?&mdash;And are you &s;ure, that what &s;he calls &s;o, nay, and, for Peace-&s;ake, what you will be willing to call &s;o too, will be called &s;o by your Children, as they grow up, and even by the re&s;t of the World? But Children, you'll &s;ay, may be unrea&s;onable and undutiful&mdash;Very well, Sir&mdash;we'll &s;uppo&s;e it &s;o; but will this make you happy, let them have Rea&s;on, or not, for their Surmi&s;es? And as &s;he cannot plead <HI>Nature</HI> for the Regulator of her Conduct towards them, but common Civility, and Prudence only, at the very be&s;t; will there not be two to one on the Childrens Side, that they may be right? But whoever may be right or wrong, if you are made unhappy by it, that's the e&s;&s;ential Point to you, who by this &s;econd Marriage have been the Cau&s;e of it all.</P>
<P>This is mo&s;t certain, <HI>her</HI> Views mu&s;t be quite contrary to tho&s;e of your <HI>Children:</HI> 'Tis true, theirs will of Con&s;equence be likewi&s;e contrary to hers, and yet both may be very rea&s;onable too, according to the Character of each. And is not this a pretty Situation for you, do you think? For which Side <HI>can</HI> you, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> you take? The Children, as they grow up, will be jealous of ill Offices from her with you. She will interpret tho&s;e things which a natural Mother would think nothing of, as &s;tudied Slights; and will not their con&s;tant Bickerings make you unea&s;y in your own Family, where Un|ea&s;ine&s;s is the lea&s;t tolerable, as it is the Place to which a Man &s;hould retire for Comfort, when the World gives him Cau&s;e of Di&s;plea&s;ure?</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="212">
And what, pray, may this probably end in? Why, for Quietne&s;s-&s;ake, you will po&s;&s;ibly be ob|liged to &s;eparate them. The Mother-in-law, &s;hould <HI>&s;he</HI> be in <HI>Fault,</HI> you <HI>cannot</HI> part with. The Children then mu&s;t turn out, of cour&s;e. You mu&s;t &s;tudy, after reconciling and patching up a hundred Breaches, to make &s;ome other Provi&s;ion for <HI>them.</HI> And thus, perhaps, they are precipitated into a wide World, and expo&s;ed to a thou&s;and dangerous Temptations; and how can you forgive your&s;elf, if they &s;hould by this means become a Prey to the de&s;igning Attempts, the <HI>Boys,</HI> of <HI>vicious Women;</HI> the <HI>Girls,</HI> of <HI>profligate Men?</HI> And how would it have grieved the Heart of their indulgent Mother, could &s;he have fore&s;een, that her beloved Spou&s;e, in&s;tead of &s;upplying the Lo&s;s of a <HI>Mother</HI> to them, &s;hould take from them his own <HI>immediate</HI> Pro|tection, and that perhaps at a Time of Life, when it was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for their future Good?</P>
<P>This may very probably be more or le&s;s the Ca&s;e, if there be no other Difficulties, than what may ari&s;e between your Children and their Mother-in-law. But if, as is mo&s;t likely, you &s;hould have Children by this your &s;econd Wife, the Ca&s;e may be &s;till wor&s;e. She will then look upon yours by your fir&s;t, not only with a <HI>more indifferent,</HI> but probably with a <HI>jealous</HI> Eye. She will be continu|ally carking and laying up for her <HI>own,</HI> and grudge every thing you lay out upon the <HI>others.</HI> And when they are both grown up to any Bigne&s;s, what Cla&s;hings and Jarrings may not en&s;ue between the Offspring of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Father, and two <HI>different</HI> Mothers? How will you be obliged to give a Pre|ference to the Children of the <HI>latter</HI> Wife, again&s;t tho&s;e of the <HI>former;</HI> becau&s;e the Mother of the one Set is <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> and <HI>partial,</HI> and perhaps <HI>clamorous,</HI>
<PB N="196" REF="213">
in <HI>their</HI> Favour&mdash;that of the other, <HI>ab&s;ent, &s;ilent, dead, forgotten!</HI></P>
<P>If Love hides a Multitude of Faults, as no doubt it does, and <HI>Indifference,</HI> or, perhaps, as it may be, <HI>Hatred,</HI> is quick-&s;ighted to every little Slip, how will <HI>hers</HI> be all Angels! <HI>Yours</HI>&mdash;the wor&s;t &s;he can call them!&mdash;Yet how can you <HI>help</HI> this? You are married to the <HI>Temper,</HI> as well as to the <HI>Woman;</HI> and Oppo&s;ition, 'tis likely, will but make matters wor&s;e; for what the Sex cannot carry by Rea&s;on or Argu|ment, they will by Ob&s;tinacy and Teizing.</P>
<P>Then in the Matter of making Provi&s;ion re&s;pe|ctively for their future Good, how will your Soli|citudes for the <HI>one</HI> be con&s;tantly le&s;&s;ened; for the <HI>other</HI> perpetually importun'd? Nor mu&s;t your own Judgment, in <HI>either</HI> Ca&s;e, be &s;o much the Rule of your Conduct, as the fond Partiality of your &s;econd Wife for hers. And it is far from being impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;he may u&s;e your fir&s;t Children <HI>wor&s;e</HI> than &s;he would do <HI>mere Strangers,</HI> for no other Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e they have a better Title to your <HI>Regard,</HI> and &s;tand <HI>more</HI> in the way of her Intere&s;t and Views.</P>
<P>The&s;e, my good Friend, are &s;ome of the Rea&s;ons I have to alledge again&s;t &s;econd Marriages, where there are Children on one Side, and a Probability of having a &s;econd Race. As I hinted, there may be Rea&s;ons, where a Per&s;on's Circum&s;tances &s;tand in need of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance that may be procur'd by this means, to overbalance many of the Inconve|niencies I have hinted at. The le&s;&s;er Evil in this Ca&s;e is to be cho&s;en, and the Party mu&s;t make the be&s;t of the re&s;t.

<HEAD>LETTER CXLIV. Advi&s;ing a Friend again&s;t going to Law.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry to hear, that the Difference between you and Mr. <HI>Archer</HI> is at la&s;t likely to be brought to a Law-&s;uit. I wi&s;h you'd take it into your &s;eri|ous Con&s;ideration before you <HI>begin,</HI> becau&s;e it will hardly be in your Power to <HI>end</HI> it, when you plea&s;e. For you immediately put the Matter out of your own Hands, into the Hands of tho&s;e who&s;e <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> it is to protract the Suit from Term to Term, and who will as ab&s;olutely pre&s;cribe to you in it, as your Phy&s;ician in a dangerous Illne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Law, my good Friend, I look upon, more than any one thing, as the <HI>proper</HI> Puni&s;hment of an over-ha&s;ty and perver&s;e Spirit, as it is a Puni&s;h|ment that follows an Act of a Man's own &s;eeking and chu&s;ing. You will not con&s;ent perhaps <HI>now</HI> to &s;ubmit the Matter in Di&s;pute to Reference: but let me tell you, that after you have expended large Sums of Money, and &s;quandered away a deal of Time in Attendance on your Lawyers, and Pre|parations for Hearings, one Term after another, you will probably be of another Mind, and be glad <HI>Seven Years</HI> hence to leave it to that Arbitration which now you refu&s;e. He is happy who is wi&s;e by other Mens Misfortunes, &s;ays the common Adage: And why, when you have heard from all your Acquaintance, who have try'd the Experiment, what a grievous Thing the Law is, will you, notwith|&s;tanding, pay for that Wi&s;dom, which you may have at the Co&s;t of others?</P>
<P>The Repre&s;entation that was once hung up as a Sign in the <HI>Rolls</HI> Liberty, on one Side, of a Man
<PB N="198" REF="215">
all in Rags wringing his Hands, with a Label im|porting, <HI>That he had lo&s;t his Suit;</HI> and on the other, a Man that had not a Rag left, but &s;tark naked, capering and triumphing, <HI>That he had carry'd his Cau&s;e</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis &s;aid, That Sir <HI>John Tr<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, cau&s;ed this Sign to be taken down, on the Cla|mour it occa&s;ion'd among the Lawyers.</NOTE>, was a fine Emblem of going to Law, and the infatuating Madne&s;s of a litigious Spirit.</P>
<P>How excellent to this Purpo&s;e is the Advice of our Ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR, rather than &s;eek <HI>this Redre&s;s</HI> again&s;t any who would even <HI>take one's Coat,</HI> to <HI>give him his Cloak al&s;o?</HI> For, be&s;ides the Chri&s;tian Doctrine inculcated by this Precept, it will be found, as the Law is managed, and the Un|certainty that attends it, even in the <HI>be&s;t-grounded</HI> Litigations, that &s;uch a pacifick Spirit may be deemed the <HI>only</HI> way to pre&s;erve the re&s;t of one's Garments, and to prevent being &s;tript to the Skin.</P>
<P>Moreover, what wi&s;e Man would ru&s;h upon a Proceeding, where the principal Men of the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion (tho' the Oath they take, if Serj<GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">nts, ob|liges them not to &s;ign a &s;ham Plea, nor plead in a Cau&s;e again&s;t their own Opinion) are not a&s;hamed, under the &s;pecious, but &s;candalous Notion, of do|ing the <HI>be&s;t they can for their Client,</HI> to undertake, for the &s;ake of a paltry Fee, to <HI>whiten</HI> over the <HI>blacke&s;t</HI> Cau&s;e, and to defeat the <HI>ju&s;te&s;t?</HI> Where your Property may depend altogether upon the Impudence of an eloquent Pleader a&s;&s;erting <HI>any thing,</HI> a perjured Evidence &s;wearing whatever will do for his Suborner's Purpo&s;e? Where the Tricks and Mi&s;takes of Practi&s;ers, and want of trifling Forms, may Non&s;uit you? Where Deaths of Per|&s;ons made Parties to the Suit, may cau&s;e all to begin again?

him&s;elf to the&s;e Vexations and common In|cidents in the Law, if he could any way avoid it; together with the intolerable Expences and Attendances con&s;equent on a Law-&s;uit? Be&s;ides, the Fears, the Cares, the Anxieties, that revolve with every Term, and engro&s;s all a Man's Thoughts? Where <HI>legal</HI> Proofs mu&s;t be given to the <HI>plaine&s;t</HI> Facts; that a living Man is living, and identi|cally him&s;elf; and that a dead Man is dead, and buried by Certificate; where Evidence mu&s;t be brought at a great Expence to Hands and Seals affixed to Deeds and Receipts, that never were be|fore que&s;tion'd; till a Cau&s;e &s;hall be &s;plit into &s;everal Under-ones; the&s;e try'd Term by Term; and Years elap&s;e before the main Point comes to be argued, tho' originally there was but one &s;ingle Point, as you apprehended, in the Que&s;tion.

Then may &s;ucceed Tryals upon the <HI>Law</HI> Part, and Tryals upon the <HI>Equity</HI> Part; oftentimes new Tryals, or Rehearings; and the&s;e followed by Writs of Error.</P>
<P>Then you may be plung'd into the bottomle&s;s Gulf of Chancery, where you begin with Bills and An&s;wers, containing Hundreds of Sheets at exor|bitant Prices, 15 Lines in a Sheet, and 6 Words in a Line, (and a Stamp to every Sheet) barefacedly &s;o contrived to pick your Pocket: Then follow all the Train of Examinations, Interrogatories, Exceptions, Bills amended, References for Scandal and Imperti|nence, new Allegations, new Interrogatories, new Exceptions, on Pretence of in&s;ufficient An&s;wers, Replies, Rejoinders, Sur-rejoinders, Butters, Rebut|ters,

your Prudence.

Suppo&s;e he is peevi&s;h, petulant, un|ea&s;y in his Temper, and on &s;light or no Occa&s;ions, as you may think; mu&s;t <HI>you</HI> be peevi&s;h and petu|lant, becau&s;e <HI>he</HI> is &s;o?

<P>The Rea&s;on why you will not allow him to be oftener in the Right, and why you condemn as cau&s;ele&s;s his Petulance and Wa&s;pi&s;hne&s;s, mu&s;t pro|ceed in a great mea&s;ure from a &s;lender Opinion, if not Contempt, of his Judgment. If you think him a Man of Sen&s;e, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible but you &s;hould allow, that there may be &s;ome Cau&s;e, tho' you don't im|mediately penetrate it, why he &s;hould be di&s;turbed; and it would be kind in you to &s;uppo&s;e the be&s;t; as, that his Tenderne&s;s for you will not let him communicate it to you, rather than to imagine he is always in the wrong, and always angry with|out Rea&s;on.

<HEAD>LETTER CXLVII. A Lady to her Friend, a young Widow Lady, who, having bury'd a polite and excellent Husband, inclines to marry a le&s;s de&s;erving Gentleman, and of unequal Fortune.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE I to lay it down for a Maxim, that <HI>Maids</HI> often mend their Circum&s;tances by Marriage, <HI>Widows</HI> very rarely, I believe I might be ju&s;tify'd by every one's Experience. To what can the Truth of this Ob&s;ervation be owing? Is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Widows have &s;tronger Pa&s;&s;ions than Maids? Shall the proud lordly Sex have it to boa&s;t, that they are &s;uch e&s;timable Creatures, that
<PB N="206" REF="223">
when once one of them has had the Fortune to be cho&s;en by a Lady, and has been taken from her by Death, &s;he cannot live without taking another, and finds her&s;elf obliged to accept of the next that offers, thro' all Di&s;advantages, and every Degree of Inequality? Surely this cannot be the Ca&s;e! Surely a prudent, a mode&s;t Lady will not &s;ay this in <HI>&s;o many Words!</HI>&mdash;Much le&s;s then ought &s;he to con|fe&s;s it by her <HI>Actions,</HI> which are much &s;tronger than <HI>Words.</HI> For I believe no Woman who ever en|ter'd the Pale of Matrimony with &s;prightly Hopes about her, found the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion (<HI>Sex only</HI> con&s;ider'd) equal to her Expectations. The Maid may hope, may fan&s;y much, in the Commerce between the Sexes, from her meditating on the heighten'd Scenes, which pernicious Novels, and idle Ro|mances, the Poi&s;on of Female Minds, abound with. But the Widow <HI>knows</HI> 'tis all <HI>Free-ma&s;onry,</HI> all empty Hope, fla&s;hy, fooli&s;h, unworthy, unperma|nent, and, but for the Law of Nature, de&s;picable.&mdash;Whence is it then, that the <HI>wi&s;hing,</HI> expecting Maid &s;hould be more prudent than the <HI>knowing,</HI> experienced Widow? Should be better Proof, with rai&s;ed Imaginations, again&s;t Court&s;hip or Per&s;ua|&s;ion, than one who well knows the tran&s;itory Va|nity and Un&s;atisfactorine&s;s of the End to which that Court&s;hip or Per&s;ua&s;ion tends?</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, That <HI>this</HI> Point is not &s;o much the Ca&s;e, as the <HI>&s;ettled</HI> Life of Matrimony, which has been once &s;o &s;atisfactorily experienced; let the Circum&s;tances of a Lady who abounds in every thing, an&s;wer this poor, but common Excu&s;e; and let the Choice &s;he makes of the Per&s;on and Fortune of her &s;econd Husband (which is generally, as I have ob&s;erved above, in both Ca&s;es, far &s;hort of her former Choice) acquit or convict her, as her Con|duct &s;hall de&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="224">
If a young Widow indeed advantages <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> and wor&s;ts not her <HI>Children,</HI> (if &s;he has any) in her &s;econd Adventure, let her proceed: She is ju&s;ti|fied to worldly Prudence. But this, as I have &s;aid, is &s;o &s;eldom the Ca&s;e, even with Widow Ladies of Mode&s;ty, and <HI>Di&s;cretion</HI> in other re&s;pects, that I mu&s;t own I have been often puzzled and confound|ed how to account for the Motives of &s;uch an one, reputably; e&s;pecially when &s;he appears to me and all the World, neither to have done Honour to the Memory of her late Spou&s;e, to her Family, to her|&s;elf, nor, as &s;ometimes, has been the Ca&s;e, paid any regard to common Decency. How, I &s;ay, &s;hall this be accounted for, in a Lady of Prudence and Virtue? Is it, that, as one Extreme is &s;aid to border on another, <HI>extreme Joy</HI> treads on the Heels of <HI>extreme Sorrow?</HI> It cannot be; for as, on one hand, I am &s;ure there can be no <HI>extreme Joy</HI> in the matrimonial Commerce; &s;o, I fear, where a Wo|man can &s;oon forget her departed Spou&s;e, &s;he can|not be &s;en&s;ible of <HI>extreme Grief</HI> for his Lo&s;s. And if &s;he will take upon her this latter Part of the Cha|racter, and own the fir&s;t was thus indifferent to her, &s;he &s;hall have my Con&s;ent to do any thing &s;he has a mind to do, and I will exempt her willingly from the Ob&s;ervation of every other Rule of Pru|dence and Decency.</P>
<P>But in a Ca&s;e the direct Rever&s;e of this, how &s;hall we account for &s;uch a Behaviour? How in particular, if the charming, the blooming Mi&s;s <HI>Bendi&s;h,</HI> who was &s;o coy a Maiden, and with &s;o much Difficulty won by the late amiable and con|ver&s;ible Mr. <HI>Brookes,</HI> with a Fortune &s;uperior to her own, &s;hould, within a few Months after his Decea&s;e, when ble&s;t with an Affluence left her by his Genero&s;ity and Affection for her, be won by Mr.

<HEAD>LETTER CXLVIII. From a Gentleman, &s;trenuou&s;ly expo&s;tulating with an old rich Widow, about to marry a very young gay Gentleman.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very &s;orry to hear of the Encouragement you give to the Vi&s;its of young Mr. <HI>Barnes,</HI> becau&s;e of the great Difference in Years between you. I cannot help giving you the Trouble of this Expo&s;tulation, tho' I am told, (and much affected I am with the News, if it be true) that the Matter between you is &s;o far gone, that all I can &s;ay may too probably prove ineffectual.</P>
<P>Our Sex, Madam, in all your late Hu&s;band's Time, has received an Advantage and a Credit from your Conduct in the marry'd State; and now, I wi&s;h it may not receive as great a Di&s;paragement, &s;ince the prudent Mrs. <HI>Bates</HI> thinks fit to coun|tenance the Addre&s;&s;es of one who was born after &s;he was marry'd, and a Mother, and who can po&s;&s;i|bly have no other Inducement than your Fortune. I believe, Madam, you never knew one happy Marriage of this &s;ort in all your Life: And you will reflect, that you will not be intitled to Pity, nor the young Man to Cen&s;ure, if he &s;hould prove the wor&s;t and mo&s;t profligate of Hu&s;bands to you. For every one will cen&s;ure <HI>you,</HI> and acquit <HI>him,</HI>
<PB N="210" REF="227">
&s;hould he even treat you with per&s;onal Abu&s;e and Barbarity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is well known, that Mr. <HI>Barnes</HI> is a young Man of no very promi&s;ing Inclinations. Some young Gentlemen are as grave and di&s;creet at Twenty-five, as others at Thirty-five: But he has all the Vanity, the Gaiety, the Affectation, of any one at his Time of Life: And can you expect, that he will treat <HI>you</HI> well, that was never noted for treat|ing his <HI>own Mother</HI> very dutifully, who, by the way, is <HI>younger</HI> than your&s;elf? Advanced Years are the con|&s;tant Subject of Ridicule with &s;uch wild young Fel|lows, to their Shame be it &s;poken! and what can you expect, when the very Motives by which you &s;hall be &s;uppo&s;ed to be acted in &s;uch a Match, will in|volve you in the deepe&s;t Cen&s;ure, will make you the Contempt of Per&s;ons of all Ages, and both Sexes, and expo&s;e you to the low Buffoonery even of the Man you have cho&s;en, who, in&s;tead of being your Protector, as a Hu&s;band ought to be, will probably be the Per&s;on who will <HI>lead the Je&s;t</HI> that all will join in upon you, in order to excu&s;e his own &s;orbid Choice?</P>
<P>You owe it, Madam, give me Leave to &s;ay, to the <HI>Memory</HI> of your late worthy <HI>Hu&s;band;</HI> you owe it to your <HI>Sex;</HI> you owe it to <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> and your <HI>own Intere&s;t,</HI> and <HI>future Good;</HI> nay, to <HI>Decency,</HI> I will venture to add, to proceed no further in this Affair. It &s;eems to me, to be next to a Degree of Ince&s;t for a Woman all hoary and grey-goo&s;ed over by Time, or who will be &s;oon &s;o, to expo&s;e her|&s;elf to the Embraces of a young Fellow, who is not &s;o old as her fir&s;t Son would have been, had he lived. Forgive me, Madam; but I cannot help this Plain-dealing on the Occa&s;ion. If you pro|ceed in giving Encouragement to the Boy's Ad|dre&s;s, I expect not, nor can I de&s;ire, to be forgiven,

<P>YOU will have me write you down Accounts of what I &s;ee remarkable in and about <HI>London,</HI> to keep me, as you &s;ay, out of Idlene&s;s, and to enter|tain my good Friends in my Ab&s;ence.

<P>To begin then, my Aunt and Cou&s;ins carried me, in the fir&s;t Place, to &s;ee the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> which we have heard &s;o much Talk of in the Country; and which no one that vi&s;its this great Town, omits &s;eeing. 'Tis &s;ituated by the <HI>Thames</HI> Side, &s;urrounded with an old Wall, about a Mile in Compa&s;s, with a broad deep Ditch, which has generally more Mud in it than Water. All round
<PB N="213" REF="230">
the outward Wall are Guns planted, which on ex|traordinary Occa&s;ions are fired; as on more com|mon ones, they fire only Rows of others, which are fixed in the Ground, on the Wharf by the <HI>Thames.</HI> At the Entrance on the Right-hand, we &s;aw the Collection of wild Bea&s;ts kept there, as Lions, Panthers, Tygers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> al&s;o Eagles, Vul|turs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We were then carried to the Mint, where we &s;aw the manner of coining Money, and &s;triking Medals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From thence we went to the Jewel-hou&s;e, and were &s;hewn the Crown, and the other Regalia; which gave me no &s;mall Plea&s;ure, as I had never &s;een the&s;e things before, and heard &s;o much Talk of them.</P>
<P>The Hor&s;e-Armory is a fine Sight; for here they &s;hew Fifteen of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarchs on Hor&s;e|back, all in rich Armour, attended with Guards: But I think this Sight not comparable to the &s;mall Armory; for here Pikes, Mu&s;kets, Swords, Hal|berds, and Pi&s;tols, (enow, as they told us, for three|&s;core thou&s;and Men) are all placed in &s;uch beauti|ful Order, and &s;uch various Figures, repre&s;enting the Sun, Star and Garter, Half-moons, and &s;uch|like, that I was greatly delighted with the Sight, all the Arms being bright and &s;hining.</P>
<P>We &s;aw the Train of Artillery, in what they call the Grand Storehou&s;e; filled with Cannon and Mortars, all very fine, a Diving-bell, and other Curio&s;ities; and I thought, upon the whole, that this great Magazine of Curio&s;ities and Stores, was the mo&s;t worthy of the Notice of a Stranger to <HI>London,</HI> of any thing I had been &s;hewn.</P>
<P>From hence they carried me to the <HI>Monument,</HI> built in Remembrance of the Fire of <HI>London,</HI> a very curious Pillar, from the Gallery of which we had a Survey of the whole City. But as it &s;tands

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been carried by my obliging Cou&s;ins to <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> College, about a Mile from <HI>St. James</HI>'s Park, and to <HI>Ken&s;ington</HI> Palace about two Miles We&s;t from <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The College, you know, was founded by King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and fini&s;hed by the late King <HI>William,</HI> for the Reception of &s;uperannuated Officers and Soldiers. It is &s;ituated on the Banks of the <HI>Thames,</HI> its Gardens extending quite down to the River. It is a neat and &s;tately Building; the Front looking to the <HI>Thames,</HI> has a fine Hall on one Side, and a neat Chapel on the other, with a noble Pavilion, as they call it, between them. The two Sides are four Stories high, and have two Wards in each Story, containing thirty-&s;ix neat Bed-rooms each, for &s;o many Soldiers. Each Corner of this main Building is adorned with a fine Pavilion, being the Gover|nor's Lodging and Council-chamber; Lodgings for Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the Middle of the Square is a Bra&s;s Statue of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. on a Marble Pe|de&s;tal.</P>
<P>There are be&s;ides, four other large and uniform Wings; one is the Infirmary for the Sick, a &s;econd for maimed Officers, a third for Officers of the College, the fourth for Servants. The Whole is a neat, convenient and airy Building, well worth a Stranger's View.</P>
<P><HI>Ken&s;ington</HI> Palace is a very pretty Summer Retire|ment for the Court: It is adorn'd with fine Pictures,

rich Hangings, and other Ornaments. But the Gar|dens, which have been much augmented of late Years, are delightful, and we diverted our&s;elves in walk|ing round them, which gave me great Plea&s;ure; and I could not but wi&s;h, that you, Madam, were with me, becau&s;e you love walking, and would have been much plea&s;ed with the&s;e charming Gar|dens, which abound with fine Walks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A noble Piece of Water, called the <HI>Serpentine</HI> River, but for what Rea&s;on I know not, (it being a &s;trait, and not winding Piece) pre&s;ents it&s;elf to View; and there is lately a new Road made thro' <HI>Hyde-park</HI> to <HI>Ken&s;ington,</HI> by the late Q. <HI>Caroline,</HI> to keep the Gardens clear from Du&s;t in the Summer, and make them more private from Hor&s;es, Pa&s;&s;engers, Coaches, <HI>&amp;c.;</HI> for the old Road, in one Part, ran almo&s;t clo&s;e to the Wall.

<HEAD>IV. De&s;cribing <HI>Greenwich</HI> Park, and the Pa&s;&s;age to it by Water.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LAST <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> being <HI>Ea&s;ter Tue&s;day,</HI> I went with my Uncle, Aunt and Cou&s;ins, down the River, on what they call a <HI>Party of Plea&s;ure;</HI> but with De&s;ign principally to &s;ee <HI>Greenwich</HI> Park and Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="236">
We took Water at the Tower, which I de|&s;cribed in my fir&s;t Letter: I was pretty much afraid of Danger from Anchors, Cables, and &s;uch-like, as we pa&s;&s;ed by the great Numbers of Ships, that lay in our Way at fir&s;t &s;etting out. But afterwards the River looked very plea&s;ant, and the Number of Boats all rowing with the Tide, made the River look very agreeably.</P>
<P>After &s;ailing not many Miles, we come with|in Sight of the Dock-yard at <HI>Deptford,</HI> where &s;everal large Ships upon the Stocks afforded a fine Pro&s;pect; as the naval Strength of <HI>England</HI> is both its Glory and its Defence.</P>
<P>Next to <HI>Deptford,</HI> I was greatly plea&s;ed with the Pro&s;pect of the Royal Ho&s;pital at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> for Seamen grown old in the Service of their Coun|try. When we landed, we went into this fine Building; and in the <HI>In&s;ide,</HI> every thing, in my Judgment, was perfectly agreeable to the Magni|ficence of the <HI>Out&s;ide;</HI> allowing the one to be de&s;ign|ed to do Honour to the Nation, the other to &s;upport a Number of nece&s;&s;itous People, who ought to be the publick Care. The great Hall, and the Paint|ings in it, are admirable; but I know not whether they would not better &s;uit a <HI>Palace,</HI> than an <HI>Ho&s;pital;</HI> and indeed this may be &s;aid of the whole Building.</P>
<P>From thence we went into the Park; where I beheld divers odd Scenes of Holiday-folks. Here appeared a raki&s;h young Fellow, with two or three Women who look'd like Servant-maids; the Hero delighted, the Nymphs &s;miling round him&mdash;There a careful-looking Father with his Children on each Side; Trains of admiring Lovers, ready-pair'd, followed one another in thronging Crouds at the Gate; a Sea-Officer, with a Lady not over-burdened with Mode&s;ty in her Beha|viour: A Croud of City Apprentices, &s;ome with,
<PB N="220" REF="237">
&s;ome without their La&s;&s;es: Half a dozen Beaux ogling all they met: And &s;everal &s;eemingly di&s;con|&s;olate Virgins walking alone. The Concour&s;e of middling Objects pre&s;&s;ed chiefly toward a high Hill in the Middle of the Park; where, as they arrived, their Bu&s;ine&s;s was to take hold of Hands, and run down as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, amid&s;t the Huzza's of a Multitude of People, who earne&s;tly expected to &s;ee the Women fall, in hopes that their Cloaths would not lie &s;o conveniently, when they were down, as might be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>This, Madam, is a Diver&s;ion you would not expect &s;o near the polite City of <HI>London;</HI> but I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;uch a Levity po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed almo&s;t every body a&s;&s;embled on this Occa&s;ion, as made the Park, though mo&s;t beautiful in it&s;elf, no way entertain|ing to</P>

<P>YOU tell me, in your la&s;t, that my De&s;crip|tions and Ob&s;ervations are very &s;uperficial, and that both my Uncle and your&s;elf expect from me much better Accounts, than I have yet given you; for I mu&s;t deliver my <HI>Opinion,</HI> it &s;eems, on what I &s;ee, as well as tell you what I have been &s;hewn. 'Tis well I left my bettermo&s;t Subjects to the la&s;t; &s;uch, I mean, as will be&s;t bear Refle|ction; and I mu&s;t try what I can do, to regain that Reputation which your Indulgence, rather than my Merit, had formed for me in your kind
<PB N="221" REF="238">
Thoughts&mdash;Yet, I doubt, I &s;han't plea&s;e you, after all. But 'tis my Duty to try for it, and it will be yours, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, to forgive Imper|fections which I &s;hould have concealed, but for your unde&s;erved good Opinions of me, which draw them into Light.</P>
<P>I have this Afternoon been with my Cou&s;ins, to gratify the odd Curio&s;ity mo&s;t People have to &s;ee <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> or <HI>Bedlam</HI> Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>A more affecting Scene my Eyes never beheld; and &s;urely, Madam, any one inclined to be proud of human Nature, and to value them&s;elves above others, cannot go to a Place that will more effe|ctually convince them of their Folly: For there we &s;ee Man de&s;titute of every Mark of Rea&s;on and Wi&s;dom, and levelled to the Brute Creation, if not beneath it; and all the Remains of good Sen&s;e or Education, &s;erve only to make the unhappy Per&s;on appear more deplorable!</P>
<P>I had the Shock of &s;eeing the late polite and in|genious Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in one of the&s;e woful Chambers: We had heard, you know, of his being &s;omewhat di&s;ordered; but I did not expect to find him here: No &s;ooner did I put my Face to the Grate, but he leap'd from his Bed, and called me, with fright|ful Fervency, to come into his Room. The Sur|prize affected me pretty much; and my Confu&s;ion being ob&s;erved by a Croud of Strangers, I heard it pre&s;ently whi&s;per'd, That I was his Sweetheart, and the Cau&s;e of his Misfortune. My Cou&s;in a&s;|&s;ured me &s;uch Fancies were frequent upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions: But this Accident drew &s;o many Eyes upon me, as obliged me &s;oon to quit the Place.</P>
<P>I was much at a Lo&s;s to account for the Beha|viour of the Generality of People, who were looking at the&s;e melancholy Objects. In&s;tead of the Concern I think unavoidable at &s;uch a Sight, a
<PB N="222" REF="239">
&s;ort of Mirth appeared on their Countenances; and the di&s;temper'd Fancies of the mi&s;erable Patients mo&s;t unaccountably provoked Mirth, and loud Laughter, in the unthinking Auditors; and the many hideous Roarings, and wild Motions of others, &s;eemed equally entertaining to them. Nay, &s;o &s;hamefully inhuman were &s;ome, among whom (I am &s;orry to &s;ay it!) were &s;everal of my own Sex, as to endeavour to provoke the Patients into Rage, to make them Sport.</P>
<P>I have been told, this dreadful Place is often u&s;ed for the Re&s;ort of lewd Per&s;ons to meet and make A&s;&s;ignments: But that I cannot credit; &s;ince the Heart mu&s;t be abandon'd indeed, that could be vicious amid&s;t &s;o many Examples of Mi&s;ery, and of &s;uch Mi&s;ery, as, being wholly involuntary, may overtake the mo&s;t &s;ecure.</P>
<P>I am no great Admirer of publick Charities, as they are too often managed; but if we con&s;ider the Impo&s;&s;ibility of poor Peoples bearing this Misfor|tune, or providing &s;uitably for the Di&s;tempered at their own Beings, no Prai&s;e can &s;urely be too great for the Founders and Supporters of an Ho|&s;pital, which none can vi&s;it, without receiving the mo&s;t melancholy <HI>Proof</HI> of its being needful.

<HEAD>VI. Diver&s;ions of <HI>Vaux-hall</HI> de&s;cribed.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WENT on <HI>Monday</HI> la&s;t to <HI>Vaux-hall</HI> Gardens; whither every body mu&s;t go, or appear a &s;ort of Mon&s;ter in polite Company. For the Convenience
<PB N="223" REF="240">
of Waterage, as well as of Conver&s;ation, we were a pretty large Company, and the Evening proved &s;erene and clear.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> Stairs, where we took Water, was plea&s;ant enough; the <HI>Thames</HI> at High-water being a mo&s;t beautiful River, e&s;peci|ally above <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> where the green Banks, and the open Country, afford a very agreeable Pro&s;pect. The Place we landed at was crouded with Boats, and from the Water-&s;ide to the Gardens, we walk|ed through a double Line of gaping Watermen, Footmen, old Beggar-women and Children. As &s;oon as we entered the Walks, I was plea&s;ed with a &s;ort of Stage, or Scaffold, rai&s;ed at the Entrance, for the Servants of the Company to &s;it out of their Ma&s;ters way, and yet within Call of the Waiters.</P>
<P>The Mu&s;ick-gallery and Organ look perfectly polite, and their being rai&s;ed one Story from the Ground, has a good Effect upon the Mu&s;ick. The Walks are well enough, but environ'd with paltry wooden Boards, where I expected at lea&s;t a good Brick-wall. One Part of the Whole is thrown into Walks only; the other is on the Sides filled with Seats or Arbours, with painted Backs; on each of which is repre&s;ented &s;ome Scene of our mo&s;t common Plays, or the youthful Repre&s;enta|tion of the Infant Games, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I happened to have at my Back hone&s;t <HI>Hob,</HI> come dripping wet out of the Well; and the young Fellows, under Colour of &s;hewing their Ta&s;te in ob&s;erving the Beauties of the Piece, were &s;o perpetually &s;taring in our Faces, that Cou&s;in <HI>Bet</HI> and I had little Plea&s;ure in our Supper. Perhaps you will wonder at our Supping in &s;o open a Place; but, I a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, no Lady is too tender for &s;o fa&s;hionable a Repa&s;t. My Uncle treated us very chearfully; but I could not help grudging the Expence he was at;
<PB N="224" REF="241">
for when the Reckoning was paid, it amounted to no le&s;s than Ten Shillings a Head; which I think too dear, as the Entrance-money mu&s;t be &s;uffici|ent to defray the Hou&s;e and Mu&s;ick. But as the Whole is devoted to Plea&s;ure, the Expence &s;eems rather to create Satisfaction, than Di&s;ta&s;te, as it gives an Opportunity to gallant People to oblige tho&s;e they love, or pretend to love, in order, mo&s;t of them, to pay them&s;elves again with large In|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>The Figure of Mr. <HI>Handel,</HI> a great Ma&s;ter of Mu&s;ick, &s;tands on one Side the Gardens, and looks pretty enough: The Mu&s;ick plays from Five to Ten, about three Tunes (I believe I &s;hould have &s;aid Pieces) in an Hour. They are all reported to be the be&s;t Performers who a&s;&s;i&s;t here: but my rough Ears cannot di&s;tingui&s;h.</P>
<P>About Ten o' Clock, many People think of Home: But the Votaries of <HI>Cupid,</HI> I am told, about that Time, vi&s;it the remote&s;t Walks, and &s;igh out the &s;oft Pa&s;&s;ion in Accents that may po&s;&s;ibly be improved by the melting Sweetne&s;s of the Mu|&s;ick&mdash;I would not have you from hence conclude any Rudene&s;s can be offered; for at the Termina|tion of every Walk, through the whole Garden is placed a Man to protect the Company from all manner of In&s;ult. But when the Place grows thin of Company, the Lovers have a better Chance to e&s;cape being laugh'd at, on the Appearance of any amorous Symptom.</P>
<P>Soon after Ten, we returned to our Boat; and I found the Pa&s;&s;age extremely cold, notwith&s;tand|ing a Covering over us: I mu&s;t own, I wi&s;h'd to be at home, long before I reached it; for I was taken with &s;uch a Shivering, as did not leave me for two Days.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="242">
Thus, Madam, have I been at <HI>Vaux-hall,</HI> with the Crowd of Fa&s;hion-hunters. But if nobody had a greater Inclination than I have to go thither again, that Amu&s;ement would &s;oon be given up&mdash;For I &s;ee more and more, that, do what I will, Nature never de&s;igned me to be polite; and I can &s;incerely declare, that I take more Satisfaction in an Evening-walk with you up the <HI>We&s;t-grove,</HI> where I am &s;o often benefited by your good In|&s;tructions, than in the inchanting Shades of the &s;o|much celebrated <HI>Vaux-hall.</HI> I am, honoured Madam,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this Afternoon been at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> and not a little plea&s;ed with what I have &s;een there. If there can be Maje&s;ty in the Grave, here we &s;ee it: And &s;uch was the &s;olemn Effect the &s;acred Repo&s;itory had upon me, that I never found an awful Reverence equal to what I felt on that Occa&s;ion. Whatever be the Intention of erecting the&s;e co&s;tly Monuments, they &s;eem to me very capable of being made an excellent Sermon to &s;ucceeding Generations; for here the mo&s;t &s;umptuous Piles &s;erve only to &s;hew, that every one of us mu&s;t &s;ub|mit to the &s;ame Fate, that has overtaken tho&s;e whom Empire it&s;elf could not &s;ave. And how humble ought the Per&s;on to be, who &s;urveys the Royal Ruins of Mortality, pre&s;erved (as if in a vain Defiance
<PB N="226" REF="243">
of Time) to &s;hew nothing more than the Cer|tianty of our Di&s;&s;olution!</P>
<P>The&s;e, Madam, were my general Sentiments on this Occa&s;ion; but as I know you expect more particular De&s;criptions from me, I will tell you what mo&s;t &s;truck my Notice among the many remarkable Curio&s;ities to be here met with.</P>
<P>Among the Royal Monuments, tho&s;e of antient Date plea&s;ed me be&s;t; becau&s;e they look agreeable to what I read of the plain Royalty of our former Sovereigns. I lamented the Lo&s;s of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth's Head, which being Silver, as they &s;ay, was &s;tolen during the Civil War. I much wonder it has never yet been &s;upply'd from &s;ome of his Bu&s;to's. He wanted not a <HI>Head,</HI> to &s;peak in the metaphorical Style, while living; and <HI>France</HI> can te&s;tify, that his <HI>Heart</HI> de&s;erved all things of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men: For he was the Terror of the one, and the Glory of the other.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh's Chapel, in every Part of it, is &s;urpri&s;ingly magnificent and beautiful; and, as far as I can judge of &s;uch Things, far &s;urpa&s;&s;es all I have &s;een, either of antient or modern Date.</P>
<P>In this Chapel is the Chair in which our Kings for many Ages have been crown'd. 'Tis very plain, and looks as if it were not worth more than the Forfeit paid for &s;itting in it.</P>
<P>The Body of Queen <HI>Catharine,</HI> Con&s;ort to <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth, was &s;hewn us in an open Coffin; and what remains of Skin, looks like black di&s;|coloured Parchment. She is &s;aid to have been very beautiful; and, &s;urely, to view her now, is a mo&s;t effectual Antidote again&s;t the Vanity ri&s;ing from that dangerous Accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>Two Emba&s;&s;adors Coffins are kept here, &s;aid to be detained for want of having their Debts di&s;|charged. This, indeed, does little Credit to the
<PB N="227" REF="244">
Crown they &s;erved; but I can &s;carce think it the Di&s;honour de&s;ign'd them, to be repo&s;ited among the Remains of our Kings; tho' indeed &s;everal of <HI>them</HI> have their Debts unpaid too, as I am told.</P>
<P>Several Effigies are pre&s;erved in Wax; particu|larly tho&s;e of King <HI>William,</HI> and his excellent Queen <HI>Mary;</HI> as al&s;o, very lately, the truly Royal Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> To be &s;ure, this is no bad Way, for a few Years, to pre&s;erve their Likene&s;s; but I know not whether &s;uch gay Repre&s;entations &s;uit the Solemnity of a Sepulchre. And yet &s;ome that &s;tand here, &s;eem not to have de&s;erved that Di&s;tinction, if it be deemed one, in Favour of their Memories. Ge|neral <HI>Monk,</HI> if I were to judge, would be one of tho&s;e; for his con&s;tant Train of Hypocri&s;y for a long time, &s;eem'd a Contradiction to the Apo&s;to|lical Precept, <HI>Not to do Evil, that Good may come of it.</HI> A Duche&s;s of <HI>Richmond,</HI> who walked at King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Coronation, never was re|markable for any thing, as I can hear, but that.</P>
<P>A very co&s;tly Effigy of the late Duke of <HI>Buckingham&s;hire</HI> is in this Place, who was &s;omewhat remarkable in his Time, but chiefly for doing what plea&s;ed him&s;elf, whether any body el&s;e was plea&s;ed or better'd by it, or not. And, what is odd enough, the pre&s;ent Duche&s;s &s;tands by him. Her Son too, the la&s;t Duke, who died ju&s;t before he came of Age, is di&s;tingui&s;hed with an O&s;tentation &s;uperior to all the re&s;t; tho' all I can learn of him is, that he was a hopeful young Nobleman, and the Darling of his Mother.</P>
<P>General <HI>Monk,</HI> whom I mentioned before, in a Habit mourning the Power of Time, &s;tands in a Po&s;ture &s;o very fierce, as to &s;eem rather intended to &s;care Children, than for any other Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot his Royal Ma&s;ter, King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, who &s;tands in his Garter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">
<PB N="228" REF="245">
Robes, and has long been admired by all Comers, it &s;eems, for re&s;toring Monarchy; for I can re|member no worthy Actions in his Hi&s;tory, nor were we told any more, by the Per&s;on who ex|po&s;ed his Image to our View.</P>
<P>Many Rea&s;ons make it nece&s;&s;ary for the Wills of decea&s;ed Per&s;ons to be literally ob&s;erved, tho' &s;ome In&s;tances of this kind do little Honour to the Decea&s;ed; as a Monument erected to the Con&s;ort of a noble Lord, for whom a Vacancy being left on his Tomb, as for his &s;econd Wife, &s;he, becau&s;e &s;he could not take the Right-hand of his fir&s;t Lady, left &s;trict Order to be bury'd where her Bones now lie, and thereby has tran&s;mitted her Pride and Folly to &s;ucceeding Ages.</P>
<P>Near this Tomb, is the Figure of a Lady bleed|ing to Death by pricking her Finger: She was Maid of Honour to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and, I think, of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> Family. It &s;eems &s;he got her fatal Wound at her Needle; and &s;uch has been the Care of the Ladies who have &s;ucceeded her, that not one has fallen under the like Misfortune ever &s;ince.</P>

<P>Next to this is one con&s;ecrated to the Memory of the Duke that preceded him, the la&s;t of his Name of the <HI>Cavendi&s;h</HI> Family, as the other was of the <HI>Holles;</HI> with the celebrated Lady, his Duche&s;s <HI>Margaret,</HI> a great Writer, and a great Chymi&s;t, (you know we have her Olio) both lying Side by Side, on a Tomb made great by their Names, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by their Adventures; but as to outward Grandeur, wholly eclip&s;ed by the former. Behind the&s;e is a large Room, or little Chapel, &s;eparated from the publick Places, in which are repo&s;ited the <HI>Holles</HI> Family. One of the&s;e Gentlemen has at his Feet the Repre&s;entation of a wild Boar, in Token of his having killed one of tho&s;e Animals, when he was on a Croi&s;ade. Another has a large black Patch over his Right|eye, having lo&s;t an Eye on the like Expedition.</P>
<P>Not far from hence, a fine Monument &s;tands, to the Memory of Dr. <HI>Chamberlen,</HI> a Man-mid|wife, of no great Fame when living, but who happened to have the E&s;teem of the pre&s;ent Duche&s;s of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who erected this to his Memory.</P>

<HEAD>X. On the Diver&s;ions of the Play-hou&s;e.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOW I have, by your Indulgence, tarry'd in Town till the Approach of Winter, you will expect that I &s;hould give you a little Account of the Diver&s;ions of the Stage. To begin then: My Cou&s;in <HI>William</HI> and his two Si&s;ters conducted me la&s;t Night to the Playhou&s;e, and we took Places in the Pit.</P>
<P>You may believe I was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed at the Magnificence of the Stage, and its elegant Orna|ments; and I was mightily plea&s;ed to &s;ee &s;uch a prodigious Number of People &s;eated with Ea&s;e, and conveniently placed to hear the natural Pitch of a common Voice. I did not expect to find the Mu|&s;ick &s;o near the Audience; but believe <HI>that</HI> the mo&s;t proper Situation to convey the Sound over the whole Theatre.</P>
<P>The Play I &s;aw was a Comedy, in which the Parts acted by Women had &s;everal Speeches that I thought not quite con&s;i&s;tent with the Mode&s;ty of the Sex. And the Freedom of their Voice and Ge&s;tures, tho', perhaps, &s;uitable enough to the Characters they repre&s;ented, were not &s;o plea&s;ing to a Mind bent upon innocent Amu&s;ement, (if not wholly upon In&s;truction) as Speeches that put us not to the Expence of a Blu&s;h. What Hard&s;hip mu&s;t it be to the Minds of the&s;e Women, to enter fir&s;t upon this Employment? How mu&s;t their Virtue (and &s;ure no Woman is without Virtue at her Entrance into the World) be &s;hock'd to offer them&s;elves for the Entertainment of Six
<PB N="235" REF="252">
hundred Men, and to utter Words which con|vey Ideas too gro&s;s for a mode&s;t Ear, and &s;uch as would be difficult to hear in private Company without Confu&s;ion! How hard then mu&s;t the Utterance of them be to a numerous and gay A&s;&s;embly! And yet, I am a&s;&s;ured, &s;everal Women who get their Bread upon the Stage, are &s;trictly virtuous. If &s;uch there are, how great mu&s;t be their Merit, when compared with that of the wicked ones of our Sex, who are liable to none of their certain and numerous Temptations? But yet, where it can be avoided, why &s;hould Women ex|po&s;e them&s;elves to certain Dangers, if there is a Po&s;&s;ibility of obtaining a tolerable Sub&s;i&s;tence with|out it? And tho&s;e who can live by Performance upon the Stage, certainly require Qualifications more than &s;ufficient to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in &s;afer and le&s;s dependent Stations.</P>
<P>The Behaviour of the Men, I did not &s;o much wonder at; for a becoming A&s;&s;urance in them is rather plea&s;ing than di&s;obliging: Nor did I per|ceive, that &s;o many Expre&s;&s;ions, which are oftener mi&s;called <HI>arch,</HI> than more truly named <HI>ob&s;cene,</HI> were put into the Mouths of the Men as of the Women; tho' the Rea&s;on the Poets have for this I cannot gue&s;s.</P>
<P>The Conduct of the Company I thought, to the highe&s;t Degree, commendable: The utmo&s;t Decency was ob&s;erved, and I &s;aw nothing di&s;agree|able to the &s;tricte&s;t Politene&s;s or good Manners; the Awe given by &s;o great an Audience of Per|&s;ons of Ta&s;te, being too much to admit any thing but what is decent and obliging: Not that I think it advi&s;eable for Women to go alone to the Play-hou&s;e; for the <HI>Complai&s;ance,</HI> &s;o fa&s;hionable at pre|&s;ent, affords a &s;ort of <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> for laying them under &s;uch &s;eeming Obligations as cannot be

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this Day been &s;atisfying a Curio&s;ity I believe natural to mo&s;t People, by &s;eeing an Execution at <HI>Tyburn:</HI> The Sight has had an extra|ordinary Effect upon me, which is more owing to the unexpected Oddne&s;s of the Scene, than the affecting Concern which is unavoidable in a think|ing Per&s;on, at a Spectacle &s;o awful, and &s;o intere&s;t|ing, to all who con&s;ider them&s;elves of the &s;ame Species with the unhappy Sufferer.</P>
<P>That I might the better view the Pri&s;oners, and e&s;cape the Pre&s;&s;ure of the Mob, which is prodi|gious, nay, almo&s;t incredible, if we con&s;ider the Frequency of the&s;e Executions in <HI>London,</HI> which is once a Month; I mounted my Hor&s;e, and ac|companied the melancholy Cavalcade from <HI>New|gate</HI> to the fatal Tree. The Criminals were Five in Number. I was much di&s;appointed at the Un|concern and Carele&s;ne&s;s that appeared in the Faces of Three of the unhappy Wretches: The Coun|tenances of the other Two were &s;pread with that Horror and De&s;pair which is not to be wonder'd at in Men who&s;e Period of Life is &s;o near, with the terrible Aggravation of its being ha&s;ten'd by their own voluntary Indi&s;cretion and Mi&s;deeds. The Exhortation &s;poken by the Bell-man, from the Wall of <HI>St. Sepulchre</HI>'s Church-yard, is well intended; but the Noi&s;e of the Officers, and the
<PB N="240" REF="257">
Mob, was &s;o great, and the &s;illy Curio&s;ity of People climbing into the Cart to take leave of the Crimi|nals, made &s;uch a confu&s;ed Noi&s;e, that I could not hear the Words of the Exhortation when &s;poken; tho' they are as follow:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All good People, pray heartily to GOD for the&s;e poor Sinners, who now are going to their Deaths; for whom this great Bell doth toll."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You that are condemn'd to die, repent with lamentable Tears. A&s;k Mercy of the Lord for the Salvation of your own Souls, thro' the Merits, Death, and Pa&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who now &s;its at the Right-hand of God, to make Interce&s;&s;ion for as many of you as peni|tently return unto him."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Lord have Mercy upon you! Chri&s;t have Mercy upon you!</HI>"</Q>&mdash;Which la&s;t Words the Bell-man repeats three times.</P>
<P>All the way up <HI>Holborn</HI> the Croud was &s;o great, as at every twenty or thirty Yards, to ob&s;truct the Pa&s;&s;age; and Wine, notwith&s;tanding a late good Order again&s;t that Practice, was brought the Male|factors, who drank greedily of it, which I thought did not &s;uit well with their deplorable Circum|&s;tances: After this, the Three thoughtle&s;s young Men, who at <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;eemed not enough concerned, grew mo&s;t &s;hamefully daring and wanton; be|having them&s;elves in a manner that would have been ridiculous in Men in any Circum&s;tance what|ever: They &s;wore, laugh'd, and talk'd ob&s;cenely, and wi&s;h'd their wicked Companions good Luck, with as much A&s;&s;urance as if their Employment had been the mo&s;t lawful.</P>
<P>At the Place of Execution, the Scene grew &s;till more &s;hocking; and the Clergyman who attended
<PB N="241" REF="258">
was more the Subject of Ridicule, than of their &s;erious Attention. The P&s;alm was &s;ung amid&s;t the Cur&s;es and Quarrelling of Hundreds of the mo&s;t abandon'd and profligate of Mankind: Upon whom (&s;o &s;tupid are they to any Sen&s;e of Decency) all the Preparation of the unhappy Wretches &s;eems to &s;erve only for Subject of a barbarous kind of Mirth, altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with Humanity. And as &s;oon as the poor Creatures were half dead, I was much &s;urpri&s;ed, before &s;uch a Number of Peace-Officers, to &s;ee the Populace fall to halling and pulling the Carca&s;&s;es with &s;o much Earne&s;t|ne&s;s as to occa&s;ion &s;everal warm Rencounters, and broken Heads. The&s;e, I was told, were the Friends of the Per&s;ons executed, or &s;uch as, for the &s;ake of Tumult, cho&s;e to appear &s;o, and &s;ome Per&s;ons &s;ent by private Surgeons to obtain Bodies for Di&s;&s;ection. The Conte&s;ts between the&s;e were &s;ierce and bloody, and frightful to look at: So that I made the be&s;t of my way out of the Crowd, and, with &s;ome Difficulty, rode back among a large Number of People, who had been upon the &s;ame Errand with my&s;elf. The Face of every one &s;poke a kind of Mirth, as if the Spectacle they had be|held had afforded Plea&s;ure in&s;tead of Pain, which I am wholly unable to account for.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Aunt,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE, on &s;o many Occa&s;ions, as well of this, as other kinds, been obliged to your kind Con|cern for me, that I &s;hould be very ingrateful, if I conceal'd from you the lea&s;t Bya&s;s of my Mind on &s;o important an Occa&s;ion. I think truly with you, that Mr. <HI>Ru&s;hford</HI> is a very valuable Gentleman; yet he is over-nice &s;ometimes as to the Company I &s;ee; and would take upon him a little too much, if I did not keep him at a Di&s;tance; and particularly is &s;o unea&s;y about the Captain, that he wants me to forbear &s;eeing him on any Occa&s;ion. Now, I think, this is a little too pre&s;cribing, for the Time
<PB N="244" REF="261">
of our Acquaintance, and the &s;mall Progre&s;s I have hitherto permitted to the Intimacy between us. For what is this but &s;urrendering to him upon his own Terms? and that, too, before I am &s;um|moned in Form? Nothing but a <HI>betrothed</HI> Lover, or a <HI>Hu&s;band,</HI> has &s;urely a Right to expect this Ob|&s;ervance; and if I were to oblige him, it is ab&s;o|lutely putting my&s;elf in his Power, before he con|vinces me how he will u&s;e it. O my dear Aunt, the&s;e Men, I &s;ee, even the worthie&s;t of them, are incroaching Creatures!&mdash;And a Woman that would not be de&s;pis'd, mu&s;t not make her Will too cheap an Offering to that of her Admirer. Then, my dear Aunt, I know not how it was with <HI>you</HI> formerly; but there is a Plea&s;ure in being admired, that affects one very &s;en&s;ibly; and I know not whether even Mr. <HI>Ru&s;hford</HI> would &s;ay half the fine Things he does, if he had not a Competitor that &s;ays nothing el&s;e. And I think it a kind of Robbery that a Woman commits upon her Plea|&s;ures, if &s;he <HI>too &s;oon</HI> confines her&s;elf to one. For &s;he can be but once courted; unle&s;s &s;uch an Event happens, that &s;he mu&s;t have a very bad Heart, that can wi&s;h for it. And why &s;hould a Woman ab|&s;olutely bind her&s;elf to the Terms of <HI>For Better or For Wor&s;e,</HI> before &s;he goes to Church?&mdash;I hope, when the Ceremony has pa&s;&s;ed, I &s;hall make a very good Wife: But why &s;hould I buckle to <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Obey,</HI> when it is all the Time I &s;hall have to be <HI>honoured</HI> and <HI>obeyed</HI> my&s;elf?&mdash;Indeed, Aunt, I think, there is a great deal in this.

<P>I HOPE, the Su&s;pen&s;e I gave you by my abrupt breaking off in my la&s;t, will be forgiven.

<HEAD>IV. From the &s;ame: De&s;cribing her fluttering Pretender.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INOW give you &s;ome Account of the Captain. He is a hand&s;ome Per&s;on of a Man, of a good Family: Heir to a good E&s;tate: Dre&s;&s;es well, &s;ings well, dances well&mdash;So much for his <HI>good</HI> Qualities. As for his others; he is in&s;ufferably vain; talkative; is always laughing, e&s;pecially at what he <HI>&s;ays him|&s;elf;</HI> and, &s;ometimes, at the Conceit of what he is <HI>going to &s;ay,</HI> before he <HI>&s;peaks:</HI> He has &s;uch an un|daunted A&s;&s;urance, that there is no &s;uch thing as putting him out of Countenance. One In&s;tance I'll give you&mdash;He is always admiring him&s;elf in the Gla&s;s; in&s;omuch that while he is in the Room, I cannot peep into one without &s;taring him in the Face; and one Day rallying him on this, I a&s;k'd him how the Gla&s;&s;es were fixed in a Camp? He reply'd, without He&s;itation, O Madam! the Care our Generals take to pitch our Tents by the Banks of &s;ome tran&s;parent Stream, &s;erves very well for that Purpo&s;e. And then he laugh'd mo&s;t egre|giou&s;ly for five or &s;ix Minutes together.</P>
<P>You may believe, Madam, from what I have &s;aid, that I give no great Encouragement to his Vi&s;its. Yet is there no &s;uch thing as getting rid of him; for by all his Conduct, I plainly &s;ee, he has &s;wallow'd the ridiculous Opinion, that the more
<PB N="249" REF="266">
aver&s;e a Woman appears to a Man's Addre&s;&s;es, the more Ground he has to expect Succe&s;s; and he &s;eems &s;o a&s;&s;ured of winning me, that I begin to be appre|hen&s;ive, every time he puts his Hand in his Pocket, that he will pull out a Licence and a Ring&mdash;If I admit him into my Company, I know not how to get rid of him. If I cau&s;e my&s;elf to be deny'd, he plants him&s;elf directly again&s;t my Window, that the whole Neighbourhood may know his Bu&s;ine&s;s: Thus, with or without my Con&s;ent, he will be either thought my reigning Admirer, or he will, Don <HI>Quixote</HI> like, have me for his <HI>Dulcinea,</HI> in &s;pite of my Teeth.</P>
<P>He has three or four times <HI>&s;hew'd away</HI> before Mr. <HI>Ru&s;hford,</HI> and, as I cannot forbear heartily laughing at the Airs he gives him&s;elf, tho' for very different Rea&s;ons from tho&s;e by which <HI>his</HI> ri&s;ible Mu&s;cles are moved, he thinks me plea&s;ed with him; and, what is more vexatious, Mr. <HI>Ru&s;hford</HI> thinks &s;o too, and grows &s;erious and &s;ullen, as I in&s;tanc'd in my former.</P>
<P>Now, Madam, what can I do? I heartily de|&s;pi&s;e my Soldier; I greatly regard Mr. <HI>Ru&s;hford</HI>'s good Sen&s;e, good Breeding, and other good Qua|lities: But to forbid this Fop, is what I am &s;ure will have no Weight with him; for I have as good as done it &s;everal times, and he tells me, he will vi&s;it me whether I will or not, as long as I am unmarried: And to do it profe&s;&s;edly in Complai|&s;ance to Mr. <HI>Ru&s;hford,</HI> unle&s;s Matters had gone further between us, is putting my&s;elf ab&s;olutely in his Power, and declaring my&s;elf <HI>his,</HI> before he a&s;ks me the Que&s;tion. So, may I not laugh on a little at the one, and teize the other's cau&s;ele&s;s Jealou&s;y, do you think, till I bring Mr. <HI>Ru&s;hford</HI> to &s;peak out &s;o explicitly, that a Woman of &s;ome Nicene&s;s, as I pretend to be, may be in no Danger
<PB N="250" REF="267">
of mi&s;taking him? Be&s;ides, I think Mr. <HI>Ru&s;hford</HI> a little too capricious, and &s;hould be glad to break him of it, le&s;t, if it ever &s;hould be our Lot to come together, that Temper &s;hould improve upon him; and be more trouble&s;ome from an Hu&s;band, than it is from an humble Servant.

<HEAD>V. From the Aunt, containing &s;olid Advice and Caution on this Occa&s;ion.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear <HI>Lydia,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR la&s;t Letter plea&s;ed me much better than your two former: For your fir&s;t held me in great Su&s;pen&s;e; your &s;econd gave me Concern for your rigorous Treatment of poor Mr. <HI>Ru&s;hford,</HI> who, 'tis plain, loves you much; but your third confirms me in the Opinion I always entertain'd of your Prudence, in preferring a Man of Sen&s;e to a Coxcomb.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you, that nothing could give me greater Plea&s;ure, than to &s;ee you Mr. <HI>Ru&s;hford</HI>'s Bride. His Fortune is good, his Per&s;on manly and agreeable, and his Behaviour polite. But in my Opinion, you have need of all your Prudence and Caution, to avoid giving him a la&s;ting Di&s;gu&s;t; for I would have you always remember, my Dear, that nothing can give &s;uch Di&s;like to a Man of Wi&s;dom and Di&s;cernment, as to make him imagine a Fool is preferr'd to him.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="268">
If Mr. <HI>Ru&s;hford</HI> did not love you, he would not be jealous of &s;uch a Fop as you de&s;cribe; and it is enough to keep his Pa&s;&s;ions awake, when he &s;ees you &s;o grave and &s;o &s;evere, as I may &s;ay, to him, and &s;o facetious and chearful with the other. For many a Woman of Sen&s;e, in other re&s;pects, has been caught by &s;ome of tho&s;e ridiculous Airs that &s;uch empty Laughers give them&s;elves; and if you &s;hould carry your Je&s;t too &s;ar, it might make him de&s;pi&s;e a Levity, as he would be apt to con&s;true it, which he would think unworthy of his Addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I know it is but too natural to our Sex to love to be admired; but this Humour, when not properly bounded and guarded, has many times co&s;t us dear, even the Happine&s;s of all our Lives. Don't be afraid of obliging Mr. <HI>Ru&s;hford,</HI> in a Point &s;o material to his Tranquillity, and your own Repu|tation, as the forbidding the Vi&s;its of your <HI>Man of Scarlet:</HI> For, as you <HI>intend</HI> not to encourage him, and he has &s;o undaunted an A&s;&s;urance, founded on &s;o much Folly, I think, if you had no <HI>other</HI> hum|ble Servant, it would not be reputable to receive <HI>this;</HI> much le&s;s when you have one of &s;o different a Ca&s;t, that Light and Darkne&s;s are not more op|po&s;ite: And a Per&s;on mu&s;t have a very indifferent Regard to a Man of Merit, who would not give up &s;uch a one to his Reque&s;t; for the very Thought of a Competition with &s;uch a Rival, in &s;o tender and nice a Point, mu&s;t be di&s;gu&s;ting to a Man of Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides, you know not, my Dear, but Mr. <HI>Ru&s;hford</HI> may be deterr'd from a formal putting the Que&s;tion to you, by the Apprehen&s;ion that you &s;ee his Rival with too much Approbation: For can a Man of his Sen&s;e think of giving him|&s;elf up ab&s;olutely to a Per&s;on who &s;eems to waver in her Judgment, which to prefer of two &s;uch
<PB N="252" REF="269">
Competitors? Mu&s;t not the Mind that can he&s;itate one Moment on &s;uch a Deci&s;ion, appear unworthy of the Character of his Wife?</P>
<P>And then, as to teizing him for his Jealou&s;y, and breaking him of it <HI>aforehand,</HI> I doubt this &s;avours a little too much of the ungenerous Tem|pers of &s;ome of our Sex, who love to tyrannize, when they can. Prudence in a Lady is the be&s;t Cure of Jealou&s;y in a Gentleman; and is the Method you propo&s;e of laughing on with the Captain, and teizing a worthy Man, who un|doubtedly loves you, a Mark of that Prudence?&mdash;Indeed, I fear, if you go on thus, you will either lo&s;e Mr. <HI>Ru&s;hford,</HI> or will be obliged to keep him at the Expence of a Submi&s;&s;ion (after you have provok'd him) proportionable to the In&s;ult he will receive; and this, my dear Kin&s;woman, will be but little agreeable to the Pride of our <HI>Sex,</HI> and a particular Mortification to your <HI>own.</HI></P>
<P>One Rule let me give you: That the more obliging you are in the Time of <HI>your Power,</HI> the more it will move a generous Mind to indulge you, in <HI>his;</HI> and the Time you may reckon yours, may not be Three Months in Proportion to Thirty Years of his; or the whole Life. And pray, my Dear, remember, that young Ladies a&s;&s;ume a Ta&s;k they are very little qualify'd for, when they &s;et up <HI>to break Tempers,</HI> and <HI>manage Hu&s;bands,</HI> before they are <HI>married.</HI></P>
<P>Your Prudence will &s;ugge&s;t to you a very pro|per Conduct, I am &s;ure, to &s;ecure a worthy Hu&s;band, without my writing a Word more. E&s;pecially as I know it will teach you to overcome the little low Plea&s;ure, which &s;ome of our Sex take, at your Years, in being admired and flattered, and to conquer the little teizing Pride of perplex|ing and torturing the Heart of a worthy Ad|mirer,
<PB N="253" REF="270">
when we think we have it in our Power. And &s;o, hoping &s;oon to hear, that you have ba|ni&s;h'd the Captain, and are in the way to change the Name of <HI>Fenton</HI> for that of <HI>Ru&s;hford,</HI> I remain, my dear Niece,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CLXVII. From a Gentleman to his Lady, who&s;e Over|nicene&s;s in her Hou&s;e, and unea&s;y Temper with her Servants, make their Lives un|comfortable.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR kind Concern for my Ab&s;ence is very obliging. 'Tis true, I have already out-&s;tay'd my Intention by a Week; and I find the Place I am in &s;o very engaging, and Mr. <HI>Terry</HI> and his Si&s;ter &s;o agreeable, that, but to come to <HI>you,</HI> I could wil|lingly &s;tay a Month longer with <HI>them.</HI> In &s;hort, my Dear, Mr. <HI>Terry</HI> lives ju&s;t as <HI>I</HI> would wi&s;h to live; and his Si&s;ter, who is his Hou&s;e-keeper, is ju&s;t what I would wi&s;h <HI>you</HI> to be, in many Parti|culars; tho' no one, in my Opinion, can equal you in others.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know then, that Mr. <HI>Terry</HI> and I are quite happy in one another; and when he has no Vi&s;itors, are indulg'd in a very pretty Parlour, which neither Pail nor Mop is permitted to enter for two or three Days together. And when we have Company, the Dining-room is at our Service, and the kind Lady lets us &s;moak there without remarking upon the bea&s;tly Fumes that we give the Furniture. Not only &s;o, but if, by a &s;udden Turn of the Pipe, any one of us chances to be&s;trew the Floor with burnt Tobacco, we are not broken in upon either by Maid or Broom. And yet no Room can be cleaner than we find that, when we return to it from a Walk in the Gardens.</P>
<P>And indeed, I mu&s;t acquaint you, that I never &s;aw a Lady more prudently nice than Mrs. <HI>Terry.</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="273">
Her Per&s;on, Furniture, and Hou&s;e, are even Pat|terns of Neatne&s;s and good Oeconomy. I never any-where &s;aw the one or the other out-done. Yet how can this be, I marvel!&mdash;For I have &s;een her pa&s;s over the Mark of a dirty Shoe-heel, upon a Floor as white as a Curd, and never once rank the Aggre&s;&s;or among the wor&s;t of Slovens. Nay, more than that, I have &s;een her Brother drop a few Crums of Bread and Butter under his Feet, with|out &s;o much as one corrective Frown? Is not this &s;trange, my Dear? Have Batchelors, from a Si&s;ter, more Privileges, than a marry'd Man from his Wife?</P>
<P>More than this, (it is true, upon my Honour! incredible as it may &s;eem to you) t'other Day he happen'd to &s;pill a Gla&s;s of Claret upon a fine Dama&s;k Table-cloth, and broke the Gla&s;s; yet met with no other Reproof than an agreeable Laugh at his Aukwardne&s;s, and, <HI>It was well it was he that did it, who might do as he plea&s;ed with his own!.</HI> Oh, what a happy Man, thought I, is this good old Batchelor!</P>
<P>But, my Dear, prepare for more &s;trange Things &s;till: Ye&s;terday, at Dinner, he was cutting up a good fat Goo&s;e, and, by an unfortunate Spla&s;h, mo&s;t grievou&s;ly be&s;patter'd a rich Gown his Si&s;ter had on. My Heart ached upon this; for, truly, I thought, for a Moment, I was at home. But good Mrs. <HI>Terry</HI> convinced me of the contrary. Oh, Brother, &s;aid &s;he, with a Smile, what a Slip was that!&mdash;But, Misfortunes will happen!&mdash;And out &s;he pulled her Pocket Hankerchief, to wipe her Gown. I am &s;orry for it, Si&s;ter, &s;aid he. It can't be help'd, return'd &s;he, with a Smile; but I had a good Mind to put you to &s;ome Expence for this. This was all &s;he &s;aid, and &s;he kept her Seat, and eat her Dinner in perfect good Temper; nay, and <HI>look'd</HI> as ea&s;y and as plea&s;ant as &s;he &s;poke.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="274">
I mu&s;t &s;till further ob&s;erve, that, tho' all Things here are conducted with the greate&s;t Decorum, and every Servant in the Hou&s;e knows their Duty, and does it di&s;tingui&s;hingly well, yet I have never heard one high or angry Word pa&s;s between Mrs. <HI>Terry</HI> and the Maids. Is not this &s;urpri&s;ing, my Dear? What can it be owing to? I thought, for my Share, &s;o much have I been u&s;ed to a <HI>contrary</HI> Manage|ment, that no Servant could do their Duty, unle&s;s the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Family put her&s;elf out of Hu|mour with all the Hou&s;e. Either &s;he is more fortunate than you, in lighting of good Servants; or, perhaps, as Per&s;ecution makes Schi&s;maticks in the Church, &s;o finding Faults creates them in a Family. There may be &s;omething in this, my Dear; for I have &s;een your Maid <HI>Jane</HI> blunder, out of <HI>Fear;</HI> and blunder a &s;econd time, to find &s;he <HI>had</HI> blunder'd; and a third, becau&s;e &s;he was put quite out, and could not help it.&mdash;Then how has my poor Deary been di&s;compo&s;ed! How have her charming Features been even di&s;torted with Pa&s;&s;ion! not a Bit of the Lily in her Face; for the crim&s;on Ro&s;e had &s;wallowed it all up; and an Eye darting Flames of Indignation and Woe mixed together! And then, breaking Silence, Nobody ever had &s;uch Torments of Servants as I have! Alas! poor Deary! How hard is thy Hap!&mdash;How much happier this good Family! For, &s;e|cure of an Excu&s;e, rather than Blame, if a &s;mall Fault &s;hould be committed, in comes each Ser|vant, as their Duty requires, all &s;erene, plea&s;ed, chearful, as their Mi&s;tre&s;s. Their Eye is fixed upon her Eye, with a becoming Confidence of plea&s;ing; and a Nod, or a Beck, does more with them, than an hundred Words.</P>
<P>How can I, my Dear, think of leaving &s;uch a delightful Hou&s;e and Family as this?&mdash;Yet I long
<PB N="258" REF="275">
to &s;ee my beloved Spou&s;e; and I will &s;et out on <HI>Monday</HI> next for that Purpo&s;e, with as great Delight as ever I knew, &s;ince I had the Happine&s;s to call you mine. But pray, my dear Love, let what I have &s;aid, without the lea&s;t De&s;ign to offend or concern you, a little impre&s;s you, however. Let me have the Satisfaction, for <HI>both</HI> our &s;akes, of &s;eeing you get over &s;ome of tho&s;e Foibles, that make us as effectually unhappy, at times, as if we had &s;ub&s;tantial Evils to encounter with. In &s;hort, my Dear, let us think the Hou&s;e made for <HI>our</HI> U&s;e, and not we for <HI>that.</HI> And let us &s;hew our Servants, that while we would have them <HI>le&s;s faulty</HI> than they are, we will, our&s;elves, try to be <HI>more perfect</HI> than we have hitherto been; and not, while we condemn their Failings, be guilty of much greater.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice, Prudence, Ea&s;e, Plea&s;ure, Intere&s;t, Re|putation, all require this of us: And could I hope what I have written will be attended to, as I wi&s;h and mean it, you cannot conceive the Delight that will double upon me on my Return to my Deare&s;t; for it is my Pride, that I can &s;tyle my|&s;elf</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CLXVIII. From a Gentleman who in a &s;mall Fortune ex|periences the Slights of his Friends; but being &s;uddenly reputed to be rich, is oppre&s;&s;ed with the fawning Care&s;&s;es and Adulation of tho&s;e who had before neglected him.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST, for once, po&s;tpone every thing I would &s;ay to you, in order to make room for an Ac|count you little expect.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="276">
What will you &s;ay, when I tell you, that a current Report of my being <HI>immen&s;ely rich</HI> is the greate&s;t <HI>Misfortune</HI> I at pre&s;ent labour under? Nor do I find it &s;o &s;upportable as you may be apt to imagine. The Occa&s;ion was owing to the frequent Slights I had received from the Gentlewoman with whom I lodge, and from others of my Friends, who, believing that I lived up to my &s;canty Fortune, as in Truth I do, (tho' I take care to be beholden to nobody, and pay ready Money for every thing) could not treat me negligently enough. I com|plain'd of this to that arch Wag <HI>Tony Richards,</HI> who told me, he would change every one's Be|haviour to me in a few Days. And he has done it effectually: For what does he do, but, as a kind of Secret, acquaints my Landlady, that be&s;ide my poor little E&s;tate (which you know to be my All) he had lately di&s;covered, that I had Twenty thou|&s;and Pounds Stock in one of our great Companies!</P>
<P>Such was the Force of his whim&s;ical Delu&s;ion, that, the very next Morning, I had a clean Towel hung over my Water-bottle, tho' I never before had more than one a Week during the Twenty Years I have lodged here.</P>
<P>About a Week after this, my Cou&s;in <HI>Tom,</HI> who, for the two Years he has been in the <HI>Temple,</HI> has let me &s;ee him but three times, came, in a mo&s;t complai&s;ant manner, plainer dre&s;&s;ed than ever I had before &s;een him; and begg'd, if the Length of the Evening was in any Degree burden&s;ome, I would permit him to wait upon me with &s;uch Pieces of Wit, Humour, or Entertainment, as the Town afforded; the reading of which under <HI>my</HI> Ear, he was &s;ure, would be a great Advantage to <HI>him;</HI> and a&s;&s;ured me, that, for a Beginning, he had pre&s;umed to bring the la&s;t new Tragedy in his Pocket: I thank'd my young Spark. Upon which
<PB N="260" REF="277">
he is &s;o much in earne&s;t in his Ob&s;ervances, that three Nights in a Week he thus entertains me: Which will at lea&s;t be of &s;o much Service, as to keep him out of more expen&s;ive Company. And you cannot think what Pains the Rogue takes to read with the Cadence he knows I admire, and &s;its till his Teeth chatter before he offers to look towards the Fire.</P>
<P>What you will &s;till more wonder at, Sir <HI>John Hookhim</HI> called upon me before <HI>Chri&s;tmas;</HI> and tho' I have not had a Vi&s;it from him the&s;e Five Years, was &s;o obliging, as to run away with me in his Cha|riot into <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> to keep the Holidays in his Family; where his Lady treated me with the utmo&s;t Re&s;pect, and her Daughters paid me their Morning Devoirs, with the &s;ame Deference as if I had been their Grand Papa. No Dinner was concluded upon, without con&s;ulting my Palate; and the young Gentlemen, his Sons, are as ambi|tious of my hearing their Exerci&s;es, as if their Fortunes depended upon my Approbation.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John</HI> acquainted me with every Improvement he had made in his E&s;tate, and a&s;&s;ured me, that his &s;econd Son <HI>Will.</HI> my Name&s;ake, has a Genius &s;ingularly turned for managing Country Bu&s;ine&s;s, had he not had the Misfortune of having a Brother born before him; and gave me &s;everal Rea&s;ons to believe, that a fine E&s;tate, which lay in the Neigh|bourhood, and was then to be &s;old, would be a great Pennyworth. I took the Hint; but &s;aid, I had no Inclination to purcha&s;e: He &s;hook his Head at my Thou&s;ands, and told me, that, in his Opi|nion, a Land E&s;tate was preferable to the be&s;t Stock in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>When I came to Town the 4th of <HI>January,</HI> I was no &s;ooner out of Sir <HI>John</HI>'s Chariot, but my Landlady, in Per&s;on, informed me, that &s;ince I
<PB N="261" REF="278">
had been ab&s;ent, I had &s;o many Pre&s;ents &s;ent me, that &s;he had been in an hundred Fears for their &s;poiling: I a&s;ked her the Particulars, and found Five Turkeys, Three Chines, Three Hampers of <HI>Ma|deira</HI> for the Gout, Two Collars of Brawn, Gee&s;e, Chickens, Hares, and Wild-fowl, to a large Amount.</P>
<P>At Night I was welcom'd to Town by all my <HI>old</HI> Acquaintance, and about Twenty almo&s;t new ones: I was a little tired with my Journey; and had a &s;light Cold be&s;ides; which being ob&s;erved, one was running for a Phy&s;ician, another for a Surgeon, to bleed me: One thought an Emetick not improper: Another recommended a gentle Sweat, or compo&s;ing Draught; and, amid&s;t the general Officiou&s;ne&s;s, I could hear it whi&s;per'd, that if my Will was not made, Delays might prove dangerous: And, in the Morning, five Me&s;&s;engers after my Welfare arrived before Day.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you &s;ee my Peace is gone, my Tongue is of no U&s;e; for no one believes me, when I declare my real Circum&s;tances: And, under the Happine&s;s of a very &s;mall Fortune, I &s;uffer all the Afflictions attending a Man immoderately rich; and if <HI>you</HI> keep not your u&s;ual Behaviour, I &s;hall not know my&s;elf, nor any Man el&s;e; &s;ince all my Companions are become Flatterers, and all around me are &s;o ob&s;equious, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to know when I do right or wrong.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Brother.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM exceedingly concerned for the ra&s;h Step your Daughter <HI>Thoma&s;in</HI> has made: I know how it mu&s;t affect you, and I am my&s;elf not a little troubled at it. But we &s;ee how unfit we are to chu&s;e for our&s;elves! And, oh! how often are we puni&s;hed by the Enjoyment of our own Wi&s;hes!&mdash;You &s;ay, you would rather have follow'd her Corp&s;e to the Grave, than that &s;he &s;hould have thus thrown her&s;elf away on a Rake, a Prodigal, a Sot, and a Fool, as I, as well as you, know to be the Cha|racter of the Per&s;on &s;he has cho&s;en. I would not afflict you, my dear Brother, in&s;tead of pouring Balm on the Wounds of your Mind. But you will remember, that it is &s;carce two Years ago, when you were no le&s;s anxiou&s;ly di&s;turbed on Occa|&s;ion of the violent Fever, which then endangered her Life. What Vows did you not put up for her Recovery! What Tumults of Grief then agitated your afflicted Mind! And how do you know, that then &s;he was only re&s;tor'd at your ince&s;&s;ant and im|portunate Prayers; but that otherwi&s;e, God Al|mighty, knowing what was be&s;t for you both, would have taken her away from this heavy Evil! This &s;hould teach us Re&s;ignation to the Divine Will, and that we are mo&s;t unfit to chu&s;e for our|&s;elves: And even this Affliction, heavy as it is, may be &s;ent, in order to wean you from a Delight that you had too much &s;et your Heart upon.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="280">
Mean time, you mu&s;t not, by too violent a Re|&s;entment and Reprobation of her, which I find you are re&s;olv'd upon, add to the Mi&s;eries &s;he has cho&s;en. The poor Creature, will, I fear, too &s;oon find her Puni&s;hment in her Choice; and already, I under&s;tand, &s;he is driven to great Di&s;tre&s;s. You know &s;he has &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ions, and your too great Severity may precipitate her on her everla&s;ting Ruin, when &s;he becomes thoroughly &s;en&s;ible of the Condition &s;he has brought her&s;elf to, from as happy Pro&s;pects as any young Lady could promi&s;e her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Let this prevail upon you to allow her Nece&s;&s;a|ries; for, oh! 'tis a &s;ad thing for meagre Want to &s;tare in the Face a young Creature u&s;ed to the fulle&s;t Plenty! e&s;pecially when 'tis aggravated by the Reflection, that it is all owing to her own Ra&s;hne&s;s. And as it may not &s;uit with your Liking, to appear your&s;elf to allow her any thing, at lea&s;t till you &s;ee what U&s;e will be made of your Fa|vours, I will undertake, as from my&s;elf, and on my own Head, to furni&s;h, if you plea&s;e, what is immediately nece&s;&s;ary; and from time to time give you a faithful Account of the Di&s;po&s;ition in which &s;he receives it, and how her wretched De|luder is affected by it.</P>
<P>This is a Ta&s;k I &s;hould not be fond of, but to prevent wor&s;e Con&s;equences; and I mu&s;t intreat you, Brother, to weigh &s;eriou&s;ly the Matter; and as you <HI>abound,</HI> let not the unhappy Wretch, who, after all, is your Daughter, want tho&s;e <HI>Nece&s;&s;aries of Life,</HI> which all your <HI>Servants</HI> have in &s;uch Plenty.</P>
<P>I could not bear to be a Witne&s;s of the great Griefs, which mu&s;t tear a&s;under your Heart, &s;trug|gling between paternal Affection, and ju&s;t Indig|nation; which makes me chu&s;e to write to you;

&s;natched away, is what mu&s;t admini&s;ter to you the greate&s;t Grief of any thing that could po&s;&s;ibly befal you.</P>
<P>But, alas! yours is no <HI>new</HI> Ca&s;e. The greate&s;t Fa|milies have been thus afflicted, and with the Aggra|vation to &s;ome of them, that perhaps they have been deprived of their <HI>Heirs,</HI> and have not a <HI>Son left</HI> to continue their Name and Honours. The late Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> when Prince&s;s of <HI>Denmark,</HI> lo&s;t her beloved Duke of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> not only <HI>her</HI> Hopes, but the Hopes of the <HI>Nation;</HI> and the Crown, to which he &s;eem'd not only <HI>born,</HI> but <HI>fa&s;hioned,</HI> was obliged to be &s;ettled, on that Occa&s;ion, upon a di&s;tant Branch of the Royal Line.</P>
<P>The great Duke of MARLBOROUGH, who by his Merit, and his Victories, had rai&s;ed a princely E&s;tate, as well as Titles, had but one Son, the Marquis of <HI>Blandford,</HI> on whom he and his Duche&s;s built all their Hopes, for the perpetuating of tho&s;e new Honours in their Family; and he was &s;natched away by Death, when he was at the Uni|ver&s;ity, training up to become the Dignities, to which he was intitled.</P>
<P>Still more recent was the unhappy Fate of a Lady of the fir&s;t Quality in <HI>England.</HI> Her Lord had a Son lent to his advanced Years. This Son was the la&s;t of that noble Family, and on his Life depended all his Father's and his Mother's Hopes; and on his living till of Age, a valuable Part of the E&s;tate it&s;elf, which otherwi&s;e was to fall to an ille|gitimate Offspring. What Care was not u&s;ed to pre&s;erve the noble Youth! An eminent Phy&s;ician was taken into the Family, to be made a con&s;tant Watchman, as it were, over his Health and Exer|ci&s;es. The young Nobleman him&s;elf was hopeful, dutiful, and as di&s;tingui&s;hed in the Graces of his Mind, as by his Birth. He travelled; his indul|gent Mother travelled with him: He made a Cam|paign
<PB N="268" REF="285">
under his Uncle, the greate&s;t General then &s;urviving in an Age of Generals. He again travelled to re&s;tore and confirm his Health, and all the noble Mother's Hopes and Views were employ'd on the finding for her beloved Son, on his Return, a Wife &s;uitable to his Quality, and who might be a Means to pre&s;erve one of the fir&s;t Families in the King|dom, from utter Extinction.</P>
<P>What was the Event of all her Cares, her Hopes, her Vows, her Pro&s;pects?&mdash;Why, ju&s;t as the young Nobleman had (within a few Months) arrived at Age, and could have made tho&s;e Family Settle|ments, which were mo&s;t de&s;irable &s;hould be made, and the Want of which involved his noble Mother in perplexing Law-&s;uits, which, too, turn'd again&s;t her; it plea&s;ed God to deprive her of him, and he died in a foreign Land, far di&s;tant from his fond Mother; who, (&s;till more grievous, if true!) for Rea&s;ons of State, as was &s;aid, had been deny'd to accompany and attend him; and &s;o ended all her Hopes of above twenty Years &s;tanding, and in him his Family likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>A &s;till more recent Calamity to a great Family, I might mention; in the Death of two hopeful Children, the only Sons of their Father, and the only Heirs Male of one of the fir&s;t Families in the Kingdom, both &s;natch'd away, in the Space of a few Hours of one another, from healthy Con&s;ti|tutions, and no Ailments previous to the &s;udden one that carry'd them off, which was only believed to be a &s;ore Throat. In vain were the Con&s;ulta|tions of the mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians and Surgeons, who gave Attendance all Night, minutely to watch every Change of the Di&s;temper; in vain prov'd the A&s;&s;urance of the Skilful to the fond Parents, that there was no Danger. Death mocked all their Hopes; and when the fir&s;t dy'd, in vain was he opened, in order to find out, if po&s;&s;ible, the
<PB N="269" REF="286">
Cau&s;e of the fatal Malady, in order to admini&s;ter, with greater Hopes of Succe&s;s, Remedies again&s;t it, to pre&s;erve the other. That other hopeful Youth followed his Brother, and their Fate deeply wounded the Hearts of half a dozen noble Families, who&s;e intimate Relation&s;hip gave them a very near Intere&s;t in the awful Event.</P>
<P>Like In&s;tances of the Lo&s;s of hopeful Sons, and of the only Male Heirs, might be produced in other Families of prime Di&s;tinction in the Li&s;t of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nobility; but I need not enumerate more to a Mind con&s;iderate as yours, which will reflect that Death is a common Lot, from which no Rank or Degree is exempted. And I hope the&s;e Reflections, and &s;uch as you will be able to add to them, by your own Rea&s;on and Piety, will &s;erve to rebuke the Overflowings of your Grief, and con|fine it to the natural Channels, into which both God and Nature will <HI>indulge</HI> it to flow.</P>
<P>I mention not to your enlighten'd Mind, you &s;ee, the Motives, that, neverthele&s;s, might be in|&s;i&s;ted on with great Propriety, on &s;o grievous an Occa&s;ion; &s;uch as, The Uncertainty of Life: The Gratitude you ought to &s;hew for having had your Son <HI>&s;o long</HI> continu'd to you, as he was: The great Probability of his being happy in God's Mer|cies, by rea&s;on of his Hopefulne&s;s and Duty: The <HI>early</HI> Relea&s;e he has met with from the Troubles and Chances of a changeable and tran&s;itory Life: His E&s;cape from the Danger of the Temptations which his Virtue might have been tried with, had he lived to <HI>maturer</HI> Years: That this your Depriva|tion is God's Work: That he dy'd not in a di&s;tant Land, and by an untimely Death: But that you had the Satisfaction of knowing that every thing was done for him that could be done: That his Morals were &s;till untainted, and he was not cut off in the Pur&s;uit of &s;ome capital Sin, as has too
<PB N="270" REF="287">
often been the Ca&s;e with bold and daring Spirits in the Heat of their youthful Pa&s;&s;ions: And that he e&s;cap'd the Snares u&s;ually laid for young Men by idle Companions, and vicious Women, which too often entangle and catch the unthinking Mind. The&s;e will be all &s;ugge&s;ted to you from your own better Rea&s;on; and to that <HI>&s;econdarily,</HI> as to a due Re&s;ignation to the Divine Will <HI>primarily,</HI> let me re&s;er you, on this trying Occa&s;ion: Who am, with a &s;ympathizing Affection, dear Sir,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Good Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALLOW me the Liberty of condoling with you on the truly great and heavy Lo&s;s you have &s;u&s;tain'd of an excellent Hu&s;band. All we, who had the Plea&s;ure of his Friend&s;hip, mourn with you, the irretrievable Misfortune to <HI>us</HI> as well as to <HI>you.</HI> But as there is no recalling it, and as it is God's doing, we mu&s;t not repine at the Di&s;pen&s;ation, but acquie&s;ce in it. And yet to &s;ay, that neither you nor we ought to grieve for it, would be ab&s;urd and unnatural. Sinful Grief, however, we are commanded to &s;hun: And we ought to ble&s;s God, that he was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to continue him with us <HI>&s;o long,</HI> in&s;tead of mourning too heavily, that we had not <HI>longer</HI> the Plea&s;ure of his agreeable Con|ver&s;ation. We were not <HI>born</HI> together, and &s;ome of us <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have <HI>gone fir&s;t;</HI> and I have &s;ometimes
<PB N="271" REF="288">
been ready to think, (be&s;ides the Life of Glory, that, thro' God's Mercies, awaits the Good) that he is far happier, than tho&s;e he leaves behind him, in this Point, That he is &s;aved from the Regret (which fills the wounded Hearts of his &s;urviving Friends) of &s;eeing them go <HI>before him,</HI> as they have &s;een him go <HI>before them.</HI> Had he not dy'd now, a few Years would have determin'd his u&s;eful Life; for the longe&s;t Life is but a Span; and <HI>then</HI> the Matter, had he gone before us, would have been as it is <HI>now.</HI></P>
<P>We may make our own Lives mi&s;erable in be|wailing <HI>his Lo&s;s;</HI> but we cannot do <HI>him</HI> good, nor (were <HI>he</HI> to <HI>know</HI> it) <HI>Plea&s;ure.</HI> You, in particu|lar, Madam, who are now called upon to be both <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Mother</HI> to the dear Pledges of your mutual Affection, ought to take double Care, how you &s;uffer immoderate Grief to incapacitate you from this new, and more arduous and nece&s;&s;ary Ta&s;k. For by this means, you would not only do your&s;elf Hurt, but double the Lo&s;s which his dear Children have already &s;u&s;tain'd in that of their Father. And would you, Madam, make them <HI>motherle&s;s</HI> as well as <HI>fatherle&s;s?</HI>&mdash;God forbid! Con&s;ider, tho' this is a <HI>heavy</HI> Ca&s;e, yet it is a <HI>com|mon</HI> Ca&s;e. And we mu&s;t not repine, that God Almighty thought him <HI>ripe</HI> for Heaven, and put an End to his <HI>probatory</HI> State.</P>
<P>With melancholy Plea&s;ure have I often, on the Lo&s;s of Friends, contemplated the excellent Advice of the Son of <HI>Sirach,</HI> who tells us how we ought to <HI>mourn</HI> on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, and how we ought to govern our Mourning; and reminds us mo&s;t excellently, that while we are grieving for our departed Friends, <HI>our own Lives</HI> pa&s;s away, and we <HI>are not.</HI> You'll permit me to tran&s;cribe his own excellent Words, as mo&s;t &s;uitable to the Sub|ject before us.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="289"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My Son, &s;ays he, let Tears fall down over the Dead, and begin to lament; and then cover his Body according to the Cu&s;tom, and neglect not his Burial. Weep bitterly, and make great Moan, and u&s;e Lamentation as he is <HI>worthy</HI>&mdash;and then comfort thy&s;elf for thy Heavine&s;s; for of Heavine&s;s cometh <HI>Death;</HI> and the Heavine&s;s of the <HI>Heart</HI> breaketh <HI>Strength.</HI> In Affliction al&s;o Sorrow remaineth; and the Life of the Poor [or Mi&s;erable, or of tho&s;e who make them&s;elves &s;o by Mourning] is the <HI>Cur&s;e of the Heart.</HI> Take [therefore] no Heavine&s;s to Heart: Drive it away; and remember [<HI>thy own</HI>] la&s;t End. For|get it not; for there is <HI>no turning again:</HI> Thou &s;halt not do <HI>him</HI> Good, but hurt <HI>thy&s;elf.</HI> Re|member MY Judgment [&s;aith the wi&s;e Man, &s;peaking as if in the Per&s;on of our late dear Friend] for THINE al&s;o &s;hall be &s;o.

<P>To add any thing to this excellent Advice, would be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to depreciate it. I will therefore conclude with my Prayers, that God will enable you to bear as you <HI>ought,</HI> and as all your Friends <HI>wi&s;h</HI> and <HI>expect</HI> from you, this truly heavy Di&s;pen&s;ation, and that mo&s;t particularly for the &s;ake of your dear Children by him; and with a&s;&s;ure|ing you of my Service, to the utmo&s;t of my Ability: For I am, Madam, as well for <HI>theirs</HI> and <HI>your own</HI> &s;ake, as for his <HI>Memory</HI>'s &s;ake,</P>
