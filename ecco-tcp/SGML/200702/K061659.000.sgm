<HEAD>CHAP. I. </HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Introduction.&mdash;Rea&s;on for writing an Apo|logy.&mdash;The Author's Birth and Family.&mdash;Apro|mi&s;ing Genius.&mdash;Sent to <HI>Winche&s;ter School.</HI>&mdash;An Occurrence there.&mdash;A Digre&s;&s;ion on Vanity and Ambition.&mdash;Of Sy&s;tems of Philo&s;ophy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_AMONG all the Foibles incident to hu|man Nature, none take a &s;tronger Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Soul of Man than <HI>Ambi|tion.</HI> There are, indeed, &s;undry Ways and Arts to gratify this lofty Pa&s;&s;ion, which though it may divide it&s;elf into different Channels, yet from the &s;ame Source various Streams take their Ri&s;e.&mdash;My Readers may be &s;urpri&s;ed at my &s;etting out with &s;o philo&s;ophical an Apothegm; but it is a very proper Introduction to the following <HI>Apology,</HI> as it was from an innate Thir&s;t of Ambition that I undertook to publi&s;h the&s;e <HI>Memoirs</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="9">
of my <HI>own Life:</HI> Some witty &s;mart Gentlemen may call it <HI>Vanity:</HI> With all my Heart; and to deal ingenu|ou&s;ly with them, I frankly confe&s;s it was that Species of Ambition which by hereditary Happine&s;s de&s;cends to me, call'd Vanity.&mdash;A Vanity! for what? cries a more grave Annotator: To &s;hew there are two Coxcombs in a Fa|mily?&mdash;Mu&s;t there be two Apologies for the Lives of two Fellows no one car'd a Halfpenny for?&mdash;Why, perhaps merely to &s;ignalize my&s;elf, or perhaps to imitate the laudable Steps of my worthy Parent, or perhaps to defend my Conduct from &s;ome publick Reproaches; I have thought proper to make an Aplogy for my Life; and &s;urely among the Majority of the World this At|tempt will &s;tand uncen&s;ur'd, as they will be ready enough to allow the Life of no Man &s;tood more in Need of an Apology than mine. And to &s;hew my Readers what a candid impartial Per&s;on I am, I will, in this Di&s;qui&s;ition of my&s;elf, bring my own Heart to the Bar, and try it without Favour or Affection: I &s;hall con&s;equently betray much Folly, and talk much of my&s;elf, but I have very great Examples to authorize &s;uch a Liberty. Old <HI>Mich. Montaign</HI> it &s;eems in his E&s;&s;ays tattled more about his own queer Body and Mind, his Cat, and an old Woman, than all the World be&s;ide; &s;o much had he &s;et his Heart upon <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> The ingenious and mode&s;t Mr. <HI>Colley Cibber</HI> has outdone <HI>Montaign,</HI> and not only talk'd a great deal of <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> but has &s;et &s;o great a Value on <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> that after being &s;o long known, he will not let any one know what he really is, under a le&s;s Con&s;idera|tion than a <HI>Guinea</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since this was wrote, the Apology is &s;old for <HI>5s.</HI></NOTE> But in the&s;e Memoirs of my humble <HI>Self,</HI> I &s;hall, at a cheaper Rate, take the Liberty to illu&s;trate my Way of Thinking, Writing, and Acting, both as to my theatrical and private Life, by the Apolo|gy which he has made for his own; nor can I think the Publick will be di&s;pleas'd to &s;ee what Kind of a Parallel will be drawn between a <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Son,</HI> who have on many Occa&s;ions &s;o remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves.</P>

I &s;hall therefore conclude this Introduction to my Story in his Words; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Upon an hone&s;t Examination of my Heart, I am afraid the &s;ame Vanity which makes even homely People employ Painters to pre&s;erve a flattering Record of their Per&s;ons, has &s;educed me to print off this <HI>Chiaro O&s;curo</HI> of my Mind."</Q>&mdash;But as he hopes immediately after, that no one will expect a Man of his <HI>ha&s;ty Head</HI> &s;hould confine him&s;elf to any <HI>re|gular Method,</HI> I am in equal Hope that no Method, or Connexion, or Regularity will be expected from mine: I &s;hall al&s;o make <HI>Digre&s;&s;ions</HI> in my Memoirs, when I think they begin to grow too <HI>heavy</HI> for the Readers <HI>Di|ge&s;tion</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide C.

<P>I come to that cu&s;toma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y and important Point in all Hi&s;tories of <HI>Great Men,</HI> their <HI>Birth, Parentage,</HI> and <HI>Education.</HI> So great a Curio&s;ity is there in Mankind to be informed of the&s;e Particulars, that almo&s;t every re|volving Moon produces illu&s;trious Memoirs of <HI>Heroes</HI> and <HI>Heroines,</HI> whom dire De&s;tiny has allotted to a fatal End. As the&s;e Records are to pre&s;erve their Memories from more than <HI>Lethaean</HI> Oblivion, every minute Cir|cum&s;tance of their entering into the fir&s;t <HI>Scenes</HI> of Life are related; the Name of the Parents, their <HI>Trade,</HI> and <HI>Calling,</HI> and whether they &s;ent them to <HI>School,</HI> and had them in&s;tructed in <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Writing,</HI> are told with great Fidelity. The&s;e Things, on mature Deliberation, may &s;eem very trifling, and of no Signification to the World, whether they were known or not.&mdash;Very true.&mdash;But yet there is &s;uch an Avidity in human Nature for <HI>trifling,</HI> that the&s;e <HI>Tyburnian</HI> Memoirs are read by the <HI>Great Vulgar, and the Small,</HI> with no little Delecta|tion. Was there no other Excu&s;e than this Humour of Mankind, I know not how I could let my <HI>Birth</HI> be pa&s;s'd over in Silence; but the Excu&s;e my Father had made be|fore me mu&s;t &s;tand for mine, which is what my Brother <HI>Bayes</HI> makes Prince <HI>Prettyman</HI> &s;ay in the <HI>Rehear&s;al,</HI>

<P><Q REND="margQuotes">I was born in <HI>London,</HI> on the 6th of <HI>November</HI> 1671, in <HI>Southampton Street,</HI> facing <HI>Southampton Hou&s;e.</HI> My Father <HI>Caius Gabriel Cibber,</HI> was a Native of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> who came into <HI>England</HI> &s;ometime before the Re&s;to|ration of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, to follow his Pro|fe&s;&s;ion which was that of a Statuary, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Ba&s;&s;o Relievo</HI> in the Pede&s;tal of the great Column in the City, and the two Figures of the Lunaticks, the <HI>Raving</HI> and the <HI>Melancholy,</HI> over the Gates of <HI>Bethlehem Ho&s;pital</HI> are no ill Monaments of his Fame as an Arti&s;t. My Mother was the Daughter of <HI>William Colley,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of a very ancient Family of <HI>Glai&s;ton,</HI> in <HI>Rutland&s;hire,</HI> where &s;he was born.

<P>Although I am very far from laying any Stre&s;s on the Pomp of Heraldry, and a long Scroll of <HI>Family De&s;cents,</HI> for well I know, my Pedigree, though traced, (as I doubt not but it might be) to <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conqueror,</HI> will confer no intrin&s;ic Value on me; for con&s;cious I am, that any Regard to my Being, mu&s;t be beam'd only by the Rays of Virtue; yet, in <HI>&s;imple Truth,</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I think I owe &s;omething to having <HI>good Blood in my Veins.&mdash;</HI>For a <HI>Latin</HI> Poet ju&s;tly &s;ays;</P>

<P>I cannot &s;ay that among my School-Fellows I made my great Figure, or rai&s;ed their Envy by any learned Compo&s;itions; yet, I know not how it was, I had then an innate Kind of Propen&s;ity to Scribbling; and with|out any partial Flattery to my&s;elf, I can affirm I cho&s;e, or rather accidentally &s;truck into one Species of Writing, in which I was not only then without an Equal, but have remained &s;o ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Here, perhaps, I may again &s;eem vain! But if the Facts are true, how can I help it? If I have a tolerable Feature, will not that as much belong to my Picture as my Imperfection? In a Word, the Story is this.</P>
<P>While I was at <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> there came &s;ome <HI>Prize-Fighters</HI> from the <HI>Bear-Garden</HI> at <HI>London;</HI> and as I was always fond of <HI>Heroes</HI> and martial Deeds, I intro|duced my&s;elf into the Company of the&s;e Knight-Er|rants of the Blade: It happen'd that however brave the Heroes were, they were not very learned: In truth they could neither write nor read. It was on this Occa|&s;ion that they de&s;ir'd me being a better Scholard, (Prize|fighters Language) to pen their <HI>Challenges,</HI> which they in&s;tructed me to indite. . . . . . Here I gave the fir&s;t De|mon&s;tration of my Parts; for having been us'd at <HI>Lon|don</HI> to read Playhou&s;e Bills, and hear Tragedies, my Father being Ma&s;ter of a Playhou&s;e, I wrote their Bills of <HI>Challenge</HI> with &s;uch Art, and expre&s;s'd the Heroes Thoughts in &s;uch magnanimous Phraze, that they a|larm'd the Soul of the Reader, and rouz'd up a greater De&s;ire for a Gladiatorial Spectacle than all the Drums in <HI>Chri&s;tondom. . . . .</HI> The&s;e Challenges of my inditing had wonderful Succe&s;s; the People were amaz'd at the &s;welling Pompou&s;ne&s;s of the Heroes Language, and
<PB N="13" REF="20">
con&s;equently imagined that tho&s;e who were terribly courageous with their <HI>Pen,</HI> mu&s;t be very <HI>Lions</HI> at the <HI>Sword:</HI> But alas! it is one Thing <HI>Scribere,</HI> and another <HI>Agere:</HI> Their Valour did not near equal the Noblene&s;s of my De&s;cription; for the Battle they fought was a &s;ham one. . . . . However, they returned their grateful Acknowledgments to me, and I was Author of all their Challenges, which, with much Art, I diver&s;ify'd during their whole Stay.</P>
<P>Well &s;ays &s;ome grave Annotator, who has not heard &s;ome private Anecdotes of my Life, what do you infer from this Tale? . . . . Hear another, and take the Infe|rence of them both together. . . . . Some Space of Time had elaps'd &s;ince my Heroes of the Blade left <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> when a Company of Hireling Actors arriv'd. I &s;oon made my&s;elf known to them, and was accordingly ad|mitted to their Rehear&s;als: One Morning I ca&s;ually took up a Paper, which was a written Bill of the Per|formance they were to exhibit in the Evening. I im|mediately found there was &s;omething deficient, or at lea&s;t &s;omething that might be alter'd to rai&s;e the Ex|pectation of the Populace, and bring a better Audience to the Hou&s;e: I communicated my Thoughts very freely to the Ma&s;ter of the Company, and &s;hew'd &s;uch an <HI>un|common Genius</HI> for writing and compo&s;ing a <HI>Play-hou&s;e Bill,</HI> that, with a complai&s;ant Bow, he intreated me to write theirs. I comply'd with his Reque&s;t, and wrote them in &s;uch a <HI>promi&s;&s;ory Way,</HI> (a Way which has been &s;ince call'd <HI>Puffing)</HI> that they engro&s;s'd the Attention of the Town, and by an attractive Quality, brought them &s;everal good Audiences. . . . I cannot pa&s;s by one Thing; the Ma&s;ter of the Company, and his <HI>Roxana,</HI> were of an ambitious Spirit, to indulge which, I ordered their Names to be printed <HI>&s;ix Times</HI> as large as any of the Re&s;t of the Performers: An Article of <HI>Stage-Vanity,</HI> which I have &s;ince mo&s;t frequently practis'd with much Glee of Heart and Pomp-Magnificent.</P>
<P>Now to apply the&s;e Stories: from &s;uch &s;mall Begin|nings, my Genius &s;oar'd to an unequal Height; and I have had, for this Species of writing, no one hardy enough to become my Competitor in Fame. With a plea&s;ant Recordation of Mind I think what Prai&s;es were

be&s;towed on the Adverti&s;ements, and the Bills of the <HI>Bear-Garden,</HI> while I had, for &s;ome Years, the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>writing</HI> them: They were attributed to my Pen, and the mo&s;t partial Witling that ever pretended to be arch upon me, would allow that in this I was inimitable. . . .

<P>From what I have mention'd, I would ob&s;erve this; that wherever there is Merit there is a heavy Tax laid on it; Envy and Malice will demand a con&s;iderable Share of the Prai&s;e which is due to you: However great my Succe&s;s has been in the Species of Writing, I have de&s;crib'd above, yet it has rais'd me many Enemies; Per|&s;ons who cannot bear to &s;ee any &s;hining Parts in another, without endeavouring, by a Cloud of intervening Dark|ne&s;s, to eclip&s;e them. The little Genius that I have, and which hereditarily de&s;cends to me from a paternal Source of Wit, has often occa&s;ion'd me, in the very Spring-time of my Life, to become the But of witle&s;s Cen&s;ure and Invective; and the &s;ame Rea&s;on makes me frequently the Object of Raillery in publick Coffee-hou&s;es and publick News Papers. But as the greater Poll of Mankind would rather vote for Cen&s;ure than Commendation; Satire has a thou&s;and Readers where Panegyrick has one; therefore when I &s;ee my Name, or Characteri&s;tick for my Name, in a Journal or Pamphlet, I look on it as an Artifice of the Author to get a Dinner: He con&s;iders that my Face and Name are more known than many thou&s;ands of more Con&s;equence in the Kingdom; that therefore, right or wrong, a Lick at poor THE', or the <HI>Young Captain,</HI> or <HI>Ancient Pi&s;tol,</HI> or by what other Name &s;oever they plea&s;e, to dig|nify and di&s;tingui&s;h me, will be a &s;ure Bait <HI>ad cap|tandum Vulgus,</HI> to catch little Readers, and gratify the Unlearn'd. . . .

A farther Excellence <HI>Betterton</HI> had was, that he could vary his Spirit to the different Characters he acted: Tho&s;e wild impatient Starts, that fierce and fla&s;hing Fire which he threw into <HI>Hot&s;pur</HI> never came from the unruffied Temper of <HI>Brutus,</HI> (for I have &s;een, more than once, a <HI>Brutus</HI> as warm, as <HI>Hot&s;pur.)</HI> When the <HI>Betterton Brutus</HI> was pro|vok'd in his Di&s;pute with <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius,</HI> his Spirit flew only to his Eye; his &s;teady Look alone &s;upply'd that Terror which he di&s;dain'd an Intemperance of Voice &s;hould ri&s;e to.

had a Voice of that Kind which gave more Spirit to Terror than to the &s;ofter Pa&s;&s;ions, of more Strength than Melody: The Rage and Jealou&s;y of <HI>Othello</HI> became him better than the Sighs and Tenderne&s;s of <HI>Ca&s;talio;</HI> for though in <HI>Ca&s;talio</HI> he only excell'd others, in <HI>Othello</HI> he excell'd him&s;elf.

<P>_IT was before ob&s;erv'd, Women were not admitted on the Stage till after the Re&s;to|ration, yet, by the Li&s;ts I have given, you will find they were not &s;o very ea&s;ily &s;up|ply'd; for in the Company where <HI>Better|ton</HI> was engag'd, they were forc'd &s;till to put young Men into female Characters; and Mr. <HI>Kyna&s;ton</HI> &s;tands fir&s;t in that motley Ca&s;t; nor indeed had they any till Sir <HI>Wil|liam D'avenant</HI> brought them to that Company: On the contrary, the <HI>Old,</HI> or the <HI>King's Company</HI> under <HI>Kille|grew,</HI> had at fir&s;t &s;etting out &s;ome Women, who in the Summer of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Reign, even when the Companies were in their highe&s;t Pro&s;perity, were thought inimitable: How hard then is it to fix un|limited Excellence to particular Per&s;ons! . . . But of the&s;e <HI>Male Women, Kyna&s;ton</HI> was e&s;teem'd, being very young and hand&s;ome; and, according to <HI>Downes</HI>'s Phra&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Downes</HI>'s <HI>Ro&s;cius Anglicanus.</HI></NOTE>, <HI>a compleat Female Stage-Beauty, performing his Parts &s;o well, e&s;pecially</HI> Arthiope <HI>and</HI> Aglaura, <HI>Parts greatly moving Compa&s;&s;ion and Pity, that it is doubted whether any Woman that &s;ucceeded him, &s;o &s;en&s;ibly touch'd the Audience. . . .</HI> Behold the Doatage of <HI>&s;ervile Partiality! . . . .</HI> Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> &s;peaks of his Beauty, and his performing <HI>Evadne</HI> in the <HI>Maid's Tragedy,</HI> to which he &s;ubjoins a facetious Incident, which tho&s;e Shifts once occa&s;ion'd. . . <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide C.

<P>But even on Mr. <HI>Kyna&s;ton</HI>'s changing Sexes, that is, his Petticoats to the Buskin, and his Stays to the Trun|cheon, he &s;till remained famous: He had, it &s;eems, a for|mal Gravity in his Mein, which in &s;ome Characters be|came him. His Eye was piercing, and in Characters of heroick Life, led, in his Tone of Voice, an imperious Vivacity that truely depicted the Tyrant. In the&s;e two Parts, <HI>Morat</HI> in <HI>Aurengzebe,</HI> and <HI>Muley Moloch</HI> in <HI>Seba&s;|tian,</HI> he had a fierce <HI>Lyon-like Maje&s;ty,</HI> in his Utterance, that gave the Spectator a Kind of trembling Admiration.&mdash;In <HI>Henry the Fourth</HI> he was a Ma&s;ter of a different Maje&s;ty, but of &s;o true a Kind, that when he whi&s;per'd the following Line to <HI>Hot&s;pur,</HI></P>

<P>I am now entering into that Part of the Hi&s;tory, where the Theatre fell frequently in Labour of Revo|lutions. In 1690 the Stage was under the Government of united Patentees, who had under them &s;o compleat a Set of Actors as has been de&s;cribed: yet they were weak enough, or the Ta&s;te of the Publick was &s;o weak,

I therefore, to &s;top their Clamour, quitted the Actor for the Author, and told them, <HI>That &s;ince they were not inclined this Play &s;hould go farther, I gave them my Word that after this Night it &s;hould never be acted again; but that in the mean Time I hoped they would con&s;ider in who&s;e Pre&s;ence they were, and for that Rea&s;on at lea&s;t would &s;u&s;pend what farther Marks of Di&s;plea&s;ure they might think I had de&s;erved.&mdash;</HI>After a dead Silence and &s;ome little Pau&s;e, &s;ome few Hands &s;igni|fy'd their Approbation.&mdash;When the Play went on I ob&s;erv'd about a dozen Per&s;ons, of no extraordinary Appearance, &s;ullenly walk'd out of the Pit, after which every Scene of it met with Applau&s;e&mdash;But it came too late: <HI>Peace to its Manes.</HI> Now tho' this was the only Tumult that I had known to have been &s;o effectually appeas'd, in fifty Years, by any Thing that could be &s;aid to an Audience in the &s;ame Humour; yet it was no Merit in me, becau&s;e, when
<PB N="62" REF="69">
like me you &s;ubmit to their doing you all the Mi&s;chief they can, they will at any Time be &s;atisfied."</Q></P>
<P>I have been more particular in the Length of this Que|&s;tion, as it contains a curious Anecdote on damning <HI>Love in a Riddle,</HI> and carries this Moral, that a <HI>Su&s;picion</HI> of an Actor's doing a <HI>ba&s;e Action,</HI> may lay him open to very <HI>&s;evere</HI> and <HI>unju&s;t</HI> Puni&s;hments from an <HI>Audience:</HI> This unju&s;t Treatment, not three Sea&s;ons ago, became a cer|tain Actor's Fortune to meet: The Affair was of a <HI>pri|vate Nature,</HI> and therefore was thought a <HI>publick Audi|ence</HI> had no Right to take it under their Cognizance: The Affair was this.</P>
<P>There was a certain Lady,&mdash;a very fine Lady,&mdash;to whom an Actor was once &s;o fatally ally'd that the Law gave her a Privilege to call him Husband.&mdash;Hu&s;|band!&mdash;O fatal Name! This Lady was young, beauti|ful, &s;en&s;ible, and virtuous when this Actor fell in Love with her: She had appear'd on the Stage as a <HI>Singer,</HI> and was e&s;teem'd an admirable one. This Actor, who was at that Time at the Head of the theatric <HI>Revolution,</HI> which brought back the old <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Actors to their old Hou&s;e at <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> thought this young Woman had &s;o much of the <HI>amiable</HI> and <HI>virtuous</HI> in her, that without any other Con&s;ideration, made her his Wife. What connubial Love and Harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;ometime between them, tho&s;e only can judge of who&s;e Hearts have felt the inexpre&s;|&s;ible Delights of a &s;incere and mutual Union.&mdash;But alas, how &s;hort is all human Happine&s;s!&mdash;The Lady began to grow more cool in her Affections to her Hu&s;|band than her Duty, her Honour, or her Intere&s;t, ought to have &s;uffer'd her.&mdash;Her Heart was e&s;trang'd, and foreign Inclinations contaminated her Soul.&mdash;What can be &s;aid, when &s;o much Innocence &s;hould plunge &s;ud|denly and ra&s;hly into Vice!&mdash;But alas!</P>
<Q>Frailty, thy Name is Woman!</Q>
<P>This dome&s;tic Unhappine&s;s of the Actor brought on others: Negligent of every Thing, his Affairs grew wor&s;e, and he was at la&s;t compell'd to bani&s;h him&s;elf to another Kingdom, till Mea&s;ures were taken to make his Creditors ea&s;y. During his Ab&s;ence this bad Wo|man

carried on a Corre&s;pondence of the mo&s;t criminal Nature, and &s;pread every fal&s;e Report to injure him in the tendere&s;t Point, his Honour, that witty Malice could invent, or the damned&s;t Fiend perpetrate; it was report|ed her <HI>Husband</HI> was not only <HI>privy</HI> to, but the <HI>willing, procuring, pandering Promoter</HI> of her Crimes, and <HI>his own</HI> Infamy.&mdash;Good God!&mdash;What will not Ini|quity &s;ugge&s;t, and Uncharitablene&s;s believe?&mdash;Although</P>
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Motto to Letters from a Husband to a Wife, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> pub|li&s;h'd by Mr. <HI>T. C.</HI></NOTE> It is a Kind of Slander to tru&s;t Rumour.</Q>
<P>Yet this vile Notion too far prevail'd, as you will im|mediately &s;ee.&mdash;The Sea&s;on of acting was now pretty far advanc'd, and this Actor, as returned to his Employment, was to do his Duty, and get his Lively|hood at the Theatre. The Night came on he was to ap|pear; and tho' it had been bruited about the Town, that becau&s;e he was a <HI>willing Cuckold,</HI> there was a very <HI>vir|tuous Party</HI> form'd to drive him off the Stage, and not &s;uffer him to appear again; he paid little Regard to this Rumour, con&s;cious of his Innocence. But the poor De|vil found him&s;elf mi&s;taken. The Hou&s;e was very early crowded, and the harmonious di&s;cordant Concert of <HI>Catcals, Whi&s;tle, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> began to play before the Cur|tain drew up.&mdash;Well,&mdash;though the Actors were all frighten'd, the Play began with Calmne&s;s and Ap|plau&s;e; but this was only a Prelude to the Battle: When the Scene came in which he was to appear, there was a dead Silence, till he popp'd his poor Head from behind the Scenes, then at once the Hurley-Burley began, Volleys of Apples and Potatoes, and &s;uch vile Tra&s;h, flew about his Ears. He retir'd, the Storm &s;ub&s;ided; he advanc'd, it began again.&mdash;In the mo&s;t humble Ge&s;ture and Addre&s;s, he made a Motion to be heard; it was all in Vain, and he was once more pelted off.&mdash;But what can de&s;cribe, in tho&s;e dreadful Moments, the Angui&s;h of his Heart? Who can conceive the various Agitations of his Soul?&mdash;Grief, Rage, Re&s;entment, Horror, De|&s;pair mix'd with Re&s;olution, were all at once fermenting in his Bo&s;om.&mdash;But determin'd to go through the Play, he went through it amid&s;t the greate&s;t Uproar that ever was heard &s;o long a Space in a Theatre, and by a
<PB N="64" REF="71">
confident Heart he &s;urmounted what many of le&s;s Re&s;o|lution would have &s;unk under.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time after, every Joke in a Part he him|&s;elf &s;poke, or if, when he was on the Stage, any Thing was &s;aid that alluded to Cuckoldom, the Joke was made allu&s;ive to him, and the Audience had their Laugh. This could be born, and he knew it would die away of it&s;elf. But on a Trial in Relation to his Wife's Infamy, &s;omething gave Offence to a noble <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">C.

He was at la&s;t forc'd, out of prudential Rea&s;ons, not from any Conviction of his Error, to give the Colonel the Sati&s;|faction of a publick Recantation; and &s;o that Affair drop'd.</P>
<P>I could enumerate &s;everal other In&s;tances of <HI>my own,</HI> where my private Conduct and Character have laid me under a publick Cen&s;ure; but as the two In&s;tances I have quoted are the mo&s;t material, and fre&s;h in every one's Memory, they may be thought &s;ufficient to prove that the Publick, or rather &s;ome of the Publick, will a&s;|&s;ume a Liberty over a Player's private Life and Actions.</P>

<P>I mu&s;t here add a living In&s;tance of what Care and in|defatigable Indu&s;try will do: The younger <HI>Mills,</HI> not to take from him the Merit he has, is not equal to the late Mr. <HI>Mills:</HI> When he was a young Actor he follow|ed his Father's Steps, and being endow'd with a prodigi|ous Memory, would get Parts of very great Length, which then he had not a di&s;tant View of ever perform|ing: This Talent, and his Application to his Bu&s;ine&s;s, made him, in a Cour&s;e of Time, become <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> which in a Theatre is the be&s;t Recommendation. On his &s;uc|ceeding to many of Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s Parts, the Town look'd on him in a very indifferent Light; but his being always thoroughly perfect, and improving by Encouragement and Application, many Prejudices in&s;en&s;ibly wore away, and now he is &s;een in Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s Parts not without Ap|probation.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here &s;peak of <HI>my&s;elf:</HI> When I fir&s;t came on the Stage the Town had very little Hopes of me, nor did I fling out the <HI>Proffer</HI> of any <HI>great Genius,</HI> yet I was in|du&s;trious and ob&s;ervant of my Bu&s;ine&s;s on the Stage, and did all in my Power to become any Way <HI>u&s;eful.</HI> I re|member, that for Want of a better Performer, I under|took to be the <HI>Harlequin,</HI> and as few knew who it really was, I was received with more Applau&s;e than I could have imagin'd; &s;ufficient enough, if I had not had an in|born Contempt for &s;uch <HI>Mummery,</HI> to have rais'd my Vanity: Nor was this my only Succe&s;s in <HI>Pantomime;</HI> every one who remembers <HI>Doctor Fau&s;tus</HI> at <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> mu&s;t remember the <HI>Statue:</HI> All the Pantomimical Mo|tions of this magic Statue had a good Effect in that Scene; they &s;urpriz'd, they elevated, they pleas'd, and were applauded: I had the Honour to animate that <HI>Statue,</HI> yet as the Applau&s;e I receiv'd was fal&s;e, I receiv'd it not as a Tribute to the Merit of an Actor, but the Tricks of a <HI>Scaramouch,</HI> or <HI>Sadler</HI>'s <HI>Wells Tumbler:</HI> As I had &s;et my

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THE Theatre has, with Humour and Pro|priety been compared to a Political State, but the Nature of its Government has never been fixed: Some affirm the natural Con&s;titution of a Theatre is a Republick; &s;ome &s;ay it is a limited, others an unlimited Monarchy: What is the be&s;t, or what the original Form of Government was, or what future Kind of Government it may have, the mo&s;t &s;hrewd theatric Politician cannot affirm. Whatever my Notions may be as to national Government, yet, as to a Theatrical State, I mu&s;t ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s my&s;elf Anti-monarchical: I am for a Government by a few; a Triumvirate&punc; and I will tell you roundly, Reader, my Rea&s;on. The Stage never &s;ucceded better than un|der the Triumvirate; and as I can never be a &s;ole Monarch, this is the be&s;t Form I can think of, which would give me Power equal to a Monarch, though not the titular Honour; for my Co-partners in Empire &s;hould be little more than Cyphers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">gnifying, roundly,
<PB N="77" REF="84">
Nothing. They might indeed be <HI>Triumvirs;</HI> but then, like Duke <HI>Trincalo</HI> in the Play, I would Triumvir over them. This may &s;eem too vain a Conjecture of my own Parts, and too vain a Contempt of the Under&s;tand|ing of others; but in the Sequel of this Story you will find, that as I was the Bu&s;tle-ma&s;ter General, I was al&s;o the Commander-General, and Treaty-ma&s;ter Ge|neral; if with all the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ions I could not &s;ecure to my&s;elf as much or more Power than mo&s;t Monarchs in fact have, I ought to be &s;tigmatiz'd for the errante&s;t Dolt that ever pretended to <HI>Machiaveli&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>But after this <HI>Pro-aemium</HI> let me introduce Matters of Fact, for which it will be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e &s;ome few Things regarding my&s;elf before the Triumvirate was di&s;&s;olv'd, and Mr. <HI>Colley Cibber</HI> &s;old his Share in the Patent, as they will the better connect what Relations, Ob&s;ervations, Contemplations, Ruminations, Quotations, and Argumentations which may en&s;ue.</P>
<P>From the little hopes which the Publick conceived of me as an Actor who would make any Figure, by In|du&s;try, Application, and what join'd to them is <GAP DESC="foreign">, the All in All, <HI>Genius,</HI> I ro&s;e into a gradual E&s;teem of the Town: But le&s;t my Significance as an Actor &s;hould not be glaring enough, I was re&s;olved, young as I was, at a Time when the whole Nation was in a Bu&s;tle, to make my Share in it. In the Year 1720, when all Men thought of rai&s;ing E&s;tates, and bubbling the World out of what Money they could, I had a violent Ambi|tion of getting much Money, and making much Noi&s;e. Would you think it, but I will confe&s;s the Simplicity of my Heart: I thought then that were I a <HI>South-Sea</HI> Di|rector,
<Q>That I wou'd do&mdash;Ye Gods!&mdash;What I wou'd do!</Q>
But as I was, re&s;olv'd I was to act &s;omething <HI>adventrous</HI> within my Sphere; and, unlike the other Projectors, I built my Scheme on a valuable Foundation; and, ac|cording to City Phra&s;e, I had the Credit of the be&s;t Man in <HI>England</HI> to make u&s;e of: In &s;hort, as all were commencing great Men, I was re&s;olv'd to commence Author, and accordingly alter'd a Play of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s
<PB N="78" REF="85">
and had it brought on the Stage; nor was the Suc|ce&s;s of it much unequal to my Hopes. This indeed was thought &s;triking a bold Stroke; to alter <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> was a Task that &s;ome Per&s;ons, merely bigotted to Antiquity, &s;hudder'd at the Name, they calling it &s;acrificing, violating, affronting, and I don't know what, the Manes of that Bard: But &s;ure all unprejudic'd Per&s;ons will not deny, that &s;ome hi&s;torical Plays of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> want what we now call <HI>Jeau de Theatre,</HI> that is, a&mdash;, a&mdash;&s;omething nece&s;&s;ary to make <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> be. . . . more . . . more, in brief more <HI>Jeu de Theatre.</HI> My parental Exemplar had alter'd <HI>Richard</HI> the IIId before, that is, he had cull'd the Flowers of two or three Plays, and had bunch'd them up into a No&s;egay, for the Devil a Line did he write him|&s;elf; &s;ome indeed he alter'd, but &s;ome &s;ay for the wor&s;e: In this Manner I alter'd <HI>Henry the Sixth;</HI> and that the pre&s;ent and future Age might know that I had alter'd it, I printed it with my own Name, in <HI>capital Letters,</HI> in the Title-Page. This is mention'd to &s;hew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hat I did <HI>patra&s;&s;are</HI> in my fir&s;t &s;etting out in a Theatre; but here I allow <HI>non pa&s;&s;ibus aequis.</HI> From this In&s;tance, however, the Publick &s;aw there was &s;ome Spirit of Au|dacity, and the Dawn of Genius in me. From this no|table Aera I became more &s;ingularly remarkable both on and off the Stage: I had &s;ome few &s;mall Parts given me, in which I &s;ucceeded beyond Expectation; but as by this Time I knew &s;o much of a Theatre, that I was &s;en&s;ible <HI>Original Parts</HI> made the &s;tronge&s;t Influence in the Au|dience, I endeavour'd to get all the little, &s;prightly, or humourous Parts which I thought I could hit; the fir&s;t in which I was more particularly taken Notice of, was the <HI>Country Foot-Boy</HI> in the <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers.</HI> The Part was but a few Lines, yet I, without Affectation &s;ay, that I &s;truck in to the aukwardly-pert cunning of &s;uch an unlick'd Cub, &s;o naturally, that I had as many Claps as Speeches. I valued not the Length of a Part &s;o much as its Humour, and if I had Applau&s;e when I was on the Stage, I was better &s;atisfied than being on the Stage long|er, and having no Applau&s;e at all: Other young Actors of the Hou&s;e thought in regard to me, what <HI>Wilks</HI> and <HI>Powel</HI>

brought it him, and read it: He told me it was a rough Pebble, yet might do with a little poli&s;hing; for it was a tolerable good fir&s;t Play: In brief, it pleas'd him &s;o much, that he lick'd the rude <HI>Poetic Cub</HI> into that Form in which it afterwards appear'd. On his Con&s;ent it &s;hould be brought on the Stage immediately, I could not help ruminating on the Happine&s;s of my Ca&s;e as an Author; for there was not one Author then living could have brought a Performance on the Stage without infinite Trouble, Vexation, Charge and Intere&s;t. I took Care it &s;hould get into Rehear&s;al at the Time the Managers had appointed, who were &s;o civil as to compliment me with the prime Part of the Sea&s;on. <HI>It may &s;mell pragma|tical in the No&s;trils of Gravity,</HI> yet I cannot here help remarking what Ideas the Thir&s;t of <HI>Fame</HI> and <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> will rai&s;e in a generous Mind. The Reader will think, <HI>Alexander</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> and I, can have no Analogy on this Occa&s;ion: But though my Character is not <HI>parallel</HI> to him, my Soul may. The Minds of two Men, though they are plac'd at &s;ome Di&s;tance, if they think in a right Way, will and mu&s;t meet in one and the &s;ame Thought; &s;o every one knows two parallel Lines, the lea&s;t inclining to one another in the Progre&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t and will meet in one and the &s;ame Point; as then an Analogy between <HI>Me</HI> and <HI>Alexander</HI> may be mathematically prov'd, I'll &s;how it al&s;o by Example. The <HI>Maccdonian</HI> when he had meditated in Youth high Exploits, and noble Feats of Arms, his Brea&s;t all &s;welling with the Heaves and Throws of Ambition, he &s;et before his Eyes the Acts of <HI>Achilles;</HI> in&s;pired by the&s;e he &s;hook his brandi&s;h'd Falchi|on; on Conque&s;t he re&s;olv'd; . . . re&s;olv'd and conquer'd: &s;o I ruminating on dramatic Fame, <HI>Parna&s;&s;ian</HI> Glory, and three third crowded Nights, &s;et before my Eyes the Writings of <HI>Colley Cibber;</HI> in&s;pir'd by tho&s;e, I brandi&s;h'd high my Pen, hurling Defiance in vile Critick's Teeth.

<P>But as to my Play: When it began to <HI>mellow</HI> in Re|hear&s;al, and was almo&s;t ripe enough for the Stage; a pe&s;tilential Bla&s;t of Envy had like to have de&s;troy'd it, and with it all my fair Hopes: A Rumour had gone a|broad, that truly this Comedy was none of mine, but my Father's; and that he, not willing to &s;tand the Bears any more, brought it out under my Name. As ridicu|lous as this was, it gain'd Belief among many, therefore it was thought nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould make a previous Apology to the Town to &s;et Matters in a true Light, and to take off Prejudice: Accordingly I wrote a <HI>Letter</HI> to the <HI>Town,</HI> and printed it in one or more of the pub|lick Papers, in which I told them that, upon my Word and Credit, it was all <HI>my own Doings,</HI> and that my Fa|ther never wrote a Line of it, or &s;aw it. Notwith&s;tand|ing this Letter, and the intrin&s;ic Value of the Comedy, there was great Oppo&s;ition made to the Play, and damn'd it had &s;urely been, if the Epilogue &s;poke by my fir&s;t Wife <HI>Jenny Cibber</HI> and me had not &s;av'd it; for my Father knowing how it would be, wrote an <HI>Epilogue</HI> as a <HI>Dia|logue,</HI> between me and <HI>Jenny,</HI> in which &s;he told me I was a <HI>Bloc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">head to write,</HI> and that I was my <HI>Father</HI>'s <HI>own Son;</HI> all which were &s;trong Jokes with the Audi|ence.

Every one mu&s;t remember that three Years ago Mr. <HI>Colley Cibber</HI> brought to <HI>Drury-Lane Theatre</HI> his Play, alter'd from

<HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> call'd <HI>King John:</HI> It was no &s;ooner in Rehear&s;al, but &s;lap the Criticks were at him directly; Letters, Epigrams, Odes, Jokes, and all the Ribraldry of <HI>Grub&s;treet</HI> flew about in the Papers, and it was &s;aid the Templars, and their <HI>Po&s;&s;e Legi&s;latus,</HI> were engag'd to damn it. On this Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI> wrote a Letter, directed, <HI>To the Students of the Inns of Court,</HI> and very hand&s;omly and mighty civilly de&s;ired them to do no &s;uch Thing. This Letter was new Fuel to the Flame; they fell &s;oul of the Letter immediately, from whence he might ea&s;ily conjecture how they would u&s;e his Play: But what could he do; the Play was ju&s;t ready to be perform'd, the Actors perfect, Scenes painted, and much Time had been &s;pent which the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e would other|wi&s;e have been u&s;ing to his Intere&s;t, therefore he could not fairly withdraw it: However, he was re&s;olv'd it &s;hould not be damn'd; and fearing the Ma&s;ter might in&s;i&s;t on its being play'd, what does he, but at a Rehear&s;al, &s;eeing his Play lying on the Prompter's Table, he takes up the Copy, and puts it up into his Pocket <HI>&s;nug,</HI> and decently walk'd off with it, re&s;olving he would not run the Ri&s;que of &s;o precarious a Fortune.</P>

<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I and my Father fir&s;t practi&s;ed this Art, with the &s;ame Succe&s;s: It laid us open to the Critici&s;m of Coffee-hou&s;e Wits, who thought &s;oberly on what we wrote ha&s;tily: There was &s;uch canva&s;&s;ing the Stile; this was not <HI>Grammar,</HI> and that was not <HI>Sen&s;e;</HI> one Thing was <HI>fal&s;e Engli&s;h,</HI> another a <HI>Cibberi&s;m:</HI> But be&s;ides the Jokes, which if nothing el&s;e are nothing at a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l, they debated the Point over, and form'd them|&s;elves into Parties, which we experienc'd were not to our Advantage.

I do not find that any of the&s;e epi&s;tolary Ad|dre&s;&s;es to the Town from theatric Performers have done them any Service, nor would I advi&s;e, on any Occa&s;ion, to have Recour&s;e to &s;uch Expedients: How|ever, there is no Rule without Exception. Mr. <HI>Rich,</HI> who has never &s;uffered his People to make Appeals, nor ever made them him&s;elf, was at la&s;t drawn in by meer Nece&s;&s;ity.

<P>But to return, Reader, to that Station in the Theatre from whence I digre&s;s'd. After having wrote my Play call'd the <HI>Lover,</HI> I began to think my&s;elf every Day of more and more Con&s;equence; and having got an In&s;ight into the Manner of Managing, I began to think I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">s Equal to the Management of a young Company to play in the Sum|mer Sea&s;on. Accordingly I got Leave from Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> and the other Ma&s;ters, to form a young Company, and, to play during the Vacation: This was no bad Thing for the Ma&s;ters, nor the inferior Players; for the fir&s;t receiv'd a &s;ettled Payment for the U&s;e of a few old Scenes and Cloaths, and the latter generally five or &s;ix Days pay <HI>per</HI> Week for two Days Performance. Be&s;ides, I generally brought out &s;ome new Pieces and Farces, which not only turned to our immediate Account, but to the Good of the <HI>Actors,</HI> as <HI>Actors,</HI> and to the <HI>Ma&s;ters,</HI> by becoming very gainful Performances the Winter or two following. To In&s;tance this, I need &s;ay no more than that <HI>George Barnwell,</HI> the <HI>Devil to pay,</HI> the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ck Doctor,</HI> and the <HI>Beggars Opera,</HI> the Part of <HI>Polly</HI> by Mrs. <HI>Clive,</HI> were fir&s;t perform'd under my Manage|ment of Summer Companies: From the&s;e young Com|panies &s;ee what Performers have been chiefly &s;prung; Mrs <HI>Clive,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Buttler,</HI> and, though la&s;t, not lea&s;t in Love&mdash;MYSELF. This Cu&s;tom I continued till the Re|volution of the whole Company under my Conduct, of which more hereafter. This Management of mine was an undoubted Proof of my Abilities, and I did imagine I might become a Manager in my own Right: But, alas! how frail are all human Hopes! On the Death of Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cibber, &s;en.</HI> &s;old out, at a proper Oppor|tunity, his Share of the Patent to Mr. <HI>Highmore,</HI> a Gentleman who had a great liking to theatrical Affairs, and who had play'd &s;ome Parts on the Stage, meerly, I &s;uppo&s;e, to &s;hew what a Judge he was of acting, and

This may &s;erve for a Rea&s;on why I &s;o heartily enter'd into the Mea&s;ures I afterwards pro&s;ecuted: On Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>'s Death the Patent became inve&s;ted to the Property of Mr. <HI>Highmore,</HI> the Widow <HI>Booth,</HI> and the Widow <HI>Wilks.</HI> The whole Company began to murmur at being rul'd by &s;o motley a Kind of Government as they were now falling under, <HI>viz.</HI> A Man who knew nothing of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and two Women unfit for &s;uch a Province: Mr. <HI>Ellis</HI> was indeed deputed to act for Mrs. <HI>Wilks,</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t I believe that did not much better the Affairs: Mr. <HI>Ellis,</HI> however, became not only a Deputy to Mrs. <HI>Wilks,</HI> but Prime-Mini&s;ter and <HI>Fac-Totum</HI> to <HI>Highmore.</HI> This could be no plea&s;ant Situation for the other Actors, who had been &s;o many Years labouring in the Theatre, and bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e the Burthen of the Day; &s;uch as the elder <HI>Mills,</HI> Mr. <HI>John&s;on, Miller, Griffin,</HI> and &s;ome others, who, though younger, had &s;ome Claim, as <HI>Mills, jun.</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;elf:</HI> I found this an admirable Time to put in Execution a De&s;ign I had plan'd, which was, at a pro|per Opportunity, to fling off the Yoke, and &s;et up for Ma&s;ters and Managers our&s;elves: At one of our private Meetings all were complaining, yet no one propo&s;ed a Method of Redre&s;s, when I got up from my Chair and thus delivered my&s;elf.</P>

to <HI>Bridewell:</HI> But on the Trial of the Legality of his Commitment, it appear'd that he was not within the De&s;cription of the Act of the Twelfth of Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> again&s;t Vagabonds, he being a Hou&s;e-keeper, and having a Vote for the Members of Parliament for <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter:</HI> He was therefore di&s;charg'd, and conducted through the Hall, amid&s;t the triumphant Acclamations of his theatric Friends. Having carried this important Point, we had nothing to fear from the Patentees, knowing now that our Succe&s;s depended &s;olely on our own good Conduct, and the Favour of the Publick.

But the Ca&s;e is now alter'd by a late Act of Parliament, which has fix'd all Power in regard to Theatres and theatrical Affairs in the Lord Chamberlain for the Time being: As this Act is of &s;uch Importance to the Theatres, and the pa&s;&s;ing it caus'd great Debates in both Hou&s;es, it may be proper to con&s;ider the Cau&s;e and Rea&s;ons given for having it enacted; in relating which, I may give &s;ome curious Anecdotes, and State-Secrets, which Mr. <HI>C.

<P>I mu&s;t here enter the Verge of private Hi&s;tory, and by the following Anecdote &s;how, that I have that great Talent of an Hi&s;torian, not to dare to &s;peak fal&s;e, and not afraid to &s;peak Truth.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> had remov'd about this Time from <HI>Good|man's Fields</HI> to <HI>Lincoln's-Inn Fields</HI> Hou&s;e, which he had hir'd of Mr. <HI>Rich;</HI> His Removal had not an&s;wer'd his End, and his Affairs began to grow de&s;perate.

At this &s;ame Time, in a mo&s;t vile Paper, call'd <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> there was a libellous Production call'd the <HI>Golden Rump,</HI> which the Town and the Mob were Fools enough to think Wit and Humour: Now as the hitting in with the Humour of the multitudinous Mob is very advanta|geous to a Theatre, a Dramatick Piece was wrote on the <HI>Golden Rump</HI> Subject, and call'd the <HI>Golden Rump,</HI> which was given Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> to be perform'd; but before it was rehears'd it &s;o happen'd, no Matter how or why, but &s;o it happen'd, that Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> went to <HI>Downing-Street</HI> with this Satirical Farce in his Pocket, which was delivered to a <HI>great Man</HI> for his Peru&s;al; and it was found to be a &s;currilous, ignomi|nious, traiterous, &s;candalous, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> Libel a|gain&s;t Maje&s;ty it&s;elf.

<P>But, laying a&s;ide private Anecdotes of the obtaining the late Playhou&s;e Act, I mu&s;t mention what was known to all: The Ma&s;ters of the two Hou&s;es acting under the Patent made no Oppo&s;ition to this Bill; they did all in their Power to promote it, becau&s;e it would &s;up|pre&s;s, for the pre&s;ent, all Theatres but their own: They were &s;o full of this Pro&s;pect, that they did not perceive they were at the &s;ame Time becoming ab|&s;olute Dependants on a M&mdash;r; for the Bill contain'd a Clau&s;e, that the Lord Chamberlain &s;hould have a Power of licen&s;ing other Theatres, if he &s;o thought proper, within the City and Liberties of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> The Actors were indeed alarm'd, and imagin'd this Act would lay them under Oppre&s;&s;ions, from which they

could gain no proper Redre&s;s; for the con&s;tant imme|morial Way of redre&s;&s;ing Grievances, in the Govern|ment of a Theatre, is to rai&s;e a Revolt, and bring about a Revolution: But the Security of the Ma&s;ters of the Playhou&s;es, and the Alarm of the Actors were both ill|founded, as I &s;hall, in the &s;ub&s;equent Narration, make appear. If the Lord Chamberlain can grant another Licence, why then &s;hould not the Actors, who may be aggriev'd by the pre&s;ent Ma&s;ters, endeavour to gain one? I only ask that Que&s;tion here; I may explain it in ano|ther Place.</P>

to think it the mo&s;t prudent Method to make the be&s;t Retreat he could: Upon my Soul, though as an Enemy in the Field I could not be di&s;pleas'd with his Di&s;tre&s;s; yet, as he paid &s;o many thou&s;and Pounds to my Father, my hone&s;t Heart could not but feel for his being plung'd in an Affair he knew nothing of. I cannot blame my Father for &s;o advantageou&s;ly &s;elling out; and, was my hereditary Claim laid a&s;ide, he acted prudently, and con&s;equently hone&s;tly. But let that go: He made me &s;ome amends by giving <HI>High|more</HI> no a&s;&s;i&s;ting Advice how to conduct his Theatre, which, if he had, mu&s;t have greatly injured us; for no one knows that Province but my&s;elf and him. The new Purcha&s;er therefore being left to him&s;elf, and his Prime Mini&s;ter Mr. <HI>E-ll-s,</HI> Singers, Dancers, Tumblers, and other exotic Performers were hir'd at extraordinary Rates. This was but of very little Service, and the Po&s;ture of his Affairs grew daily into a wor&s;e and wor&s;e Situation.</P>
<P>I cannot but here ob&s;erve to the Reader how different our Conduct was at the <HI>Hay-market:</HI> I mu&s;t ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s, though we kept our &s;imple Heads above Water, we had got out of our Depth; for after our fir&s;t Run of Novelty and Intere&s;t was over, our Audiences grew thin, which Deficiency we &s;upplied by Orders of our own; for in the Theatres, as in Shops, the Appearance of Bu&s;ine&s;s brings Cu&s;tomers. Neverthele&s;s, we found large Deficiencies in the Office; and by the Accounts in our Books we had contracted a very con&s;iderable Debt; yet we conceal'd the State of our Ca&s;e as much as po&s;|&s;ible, re&s;olving to beat our Antagoni&s;ts our of the Field, and by &s;uch a Conque&s;t &s;et every Thing right. If the Patentees at <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> had either known our Con|dition, or had Prudence and Courage enough to bear with their own for another Sea&s;on, I know not what the Con&s;equences might have been: I may &s;ay it now, I believe we &s;hould have been forc'd to a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, and capitulated on the be&s;t Terms we cou'd have got.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> had either gain'd better Intelligence of the State of our Affairs, or from the State of tho&s;e at <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> had found the Patentees were heartily
<PB N="97" REF="104">
tir'd of their expen&s;ive in&s;tead of lucrative Offices: From one of the&s;e Rea&s;ons, or both, he had formed a Scheme, which, had it been carried into Execution, mu&s;t have proved very gainful to the Patentees, and very agreeable to the Town, as it would have given them the be&s;t Plays, play'd by the be&s;t Performers in <HI>England:</HI> But as well concerted as it was for the&s;e In|tentions, it was de&s;tructive of the natural and legal Li|berty of the Actors: They would have become mere Servants to two co-join'd Patentees; nor could have had, on any Di&s;gu&s;t or Affront, any Power to revolt. The Scheme was for to have <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Patent pur|cha&s;ed of the Patentees who were tired of it, at a cheap Rate, and then the Patentees of <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> and <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> to enter into a joint Partner&s;hip, and engage the be&s;t Actors, who &s;hould act occa&s;ionally at both Hou&s;es, performing always a Comedy at one Hou&s;e and a Tragedy at the other. There were &s;everal other Conditions which would have prov'd beneficial to the Ma&s;ters, which are needle&s;s to enumerate.</P>
<P>This Plan, though it has been long thought a new Fine&s;&s;e in theatric Policy, yet <HI>Cibber's Apology</HI> &s;hows it is an old Stage-Cunning, practis'd, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, by Mr. <HI>R&mdash;h</HI>'s Father, and Mr. <HI>Owen Swinney.</HI> This De&s;ign, however, could not be carried into Execution by Mr. <HI>R&mdash;h</HI> alone: There was wanting the <HI>Primum Mobile,</HI> the <HI>Sine qua non;</HI> the Purcha&s;e Money: On this Occa&s;ion he apply'd to Mr. <HI>Fl&mdash;t&mdash;d,</HI> who was his Friend, and propo&s;ed <HI>his</HI> purcha&s;ing the Patent, and to enter into a Sort of Partner&s;hip: This Propo&s;al was &s;et in &s;o advantageous a Light, and &s;uch fair Hopes offer'd them&s;elves, that Mr. <HI>Fl&mdash;t&mdash;d</HI> came into this Scheme, and purcha&s;ed the Patent of Mr. <HI>Highmore</HI> and the o|ther <HI>Patentees.</HI> On this Turn in Affairs, We at the <HI>Hay-market</HI> were under a mo&s;t terrible Con&s;ternation; we look'd on our&s;elves as Per&s;ons who were never to enjoy that Liberty we had &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly endeavour'd to obtain: For this Conjunction of the Patentee Ma&s;ters mu&s;t have compell'd us to have returned under their Management, our Affairs being in a very &s;ad Po&s;ture, and daily growing wor&s;e: But, very happily for us, a Breach happen'd between Mr. <HI>R&mdash;h</HI> and Mr. <HI>Fl&mdash;t&mdash;d</HI> at

At the &s;ame Time Mr. <HI>Fl&mdash;t&mdash;d</HI> had entered into a Treaty with us at the <HI>Hay-market,</HI> and agreed to allow all the managing Actors <HI>two hundred Pounds</HI> a Year each, and to &s;ome a clear Benefit, and to others a Benefit at a lower Rate than u&s;ual. As in all the Tran&s;actions of that Affair I was <HI>Treaty-Ma&s;ter General,</HI> and negociated that important Peace with the Patentee, it may be expected I &s;hould enter into a long detail on that Subject.

But perhaps tho&s;e who may peru&s;e this <HI>Apology</HI> for my <HI>Life</HI> may expect that I would enter into &s;ome very il|lu&s;trious and renowned Acts of my private Conduct which have been very publickly talked of: To &s;uch Per&s;onages I &s;hall an&s;wer, they are not to imagine a Man would &s;et down in cool Blood and write the Devil of a Satire again&s;t <HI>him&s;elf:</HI> That would be dainty apologizing indeed: No; the Thing is to &s;ay nothing har&s;h again&s;t your own dear Self, but as many &s;evere Things and Reflections as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t other People. Mr. <HI>Colley Cibber,</HI> who&s;e apologetical Talents are ad|mirable, has &s;hewn this Species of writing in <HI>Perfec|tion:</HI> A great many People, on the Publication of his Apology, cry'd, <HI>An Apology for the Life of</HI> Colley Cibber! <HI>Well, now we &s;hall &s;ee what he can &s;ay in Regard to this, and that, and t'other&mdash;</HI>Things which related to <HI>Gaming,</HI> or <HI>Gallantry,</HI> or a thou&s;and Things

I can gue&s;s what may be expected from me; what De|fence of particular Conduct. I may make; but I &s;hall relate only &s;uch Things as may &s;how my Parts, my theatrical Character, and, in &s;hort, what I think proper, not what every impertinent Per&s;on may want to know: Nor is this &s;o unfair a Proceeding as &s;ome may imagine: No Man can be obliged to accu&s;e him&s;elf: I write to put a Glo&s;s upon my Acts and Deeds, not place them in the mo&s;t odious Light, and erect my&s;elf in an hi&s;to|rical Pillory. It would al&s;o be an endle&s;s Work to vin|dicate all the &s;imple Accu&s;ations which have been brought again&s;t me, and which no Per&s;ons have any Bu&s;ine&s;s to trouble their Heads about. Should Men &s;ay, for In&s;tance, I u&s;ed my fir&s;t dear and well-beloved Wife, of ever ble&s;&s;ed Memory, <HI>J&mdash;n&mdash;y C&mdash;,</HI> with ill U&s;age: Should they affirm, that when her all pale and breathle&s;s Corps was in the Coffin laid, and I, with Sobs and Tears and interjected Sighs, had moaned to many a Witne&s;s, my too unhappy Fate, yet that &s;ame Night had a Brace of <HI>Drurian</HI> Doxies vile in the &s;ame Hou&s;e.&mdash;Again, &s;hould ba&s;e Defamation whi&s;per in my Ear I &s;old and barter'd away my pre&s;ent mo&s;t vir|tuous Spou&s;e, and that I was a voluntary Cuckold on Record: Should Scandal with her hundred-tongu'd curs'd Mouth, rumour it up and down, that neither <HI>common Honour</HI> nor <HI>common Hone&s;ty</HI> were lodg'd within the Centre of my Soul.&mdash;Should even all this be &s;aid, calm and unruff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed would I contemn it all, and look on &s;uch Reports in the cool Light of mild Philo&s;ophy. There are indeed a Set of People who will be Bu&s;y-Bodies: To &s;uch I would an&s;wer very pithily, &s;ome|times, <HI>What is that to</HI> ME, &s;ometimes, <HI>What is that to</HI> YOU. To illu&s;trate what a Propriety there is in curbing &s;uch Kind of Impertinence by a <HI>Laconic</HI> Sen|tence, I will tell you a &s;hort Story.</P>
<P>A great Lawyer, who now makes one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Figures in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> was as re|markable for his Amours as his Pleadings: What was
<PB N="101" REF="108">
his Gallantry to any Body? Yet was he often cen&s;ured and made the Object of Wit for this Foible. It hap|pen'd his <HI>Lady,</HI> his <HI>Chambermaid,</HI> and <HI>Cou&s;in</HI> all lay-in at the &s;ame Time: A Friend of his took an Occa&s;ion to &s;peak to him on this Subject by Way of Raillery, in this Manner: They &s;ay, my L&mdash;d, your <HI>Lady</HI> is brought to Bed.<HI>&mdash;She is &s;o.&mdash;</HI>They &s;ay your <HI>Cou&s;in</HI> and <HI>Cham|bermaid</HI> are al&s;o brought to Bed.<HI>&mdash;What's that to</HI> ME.&mdash;But they &s;ay you are the Father.<HI>&mdash;What's that to</HI> YOU.&mdash;Upon which, turning on his Heel, my L&mdash;d left Mr. <HI>Impertinent</HI> with a proper Indignation.<HI>&mdash;What's that to You,</HI> is the &s;ole An&s;wer I &s;hall give to any defamatory Scurrility, and if any Per&s;on is not &s;a|tisfied with &s;uch a Reply, he may get a more &s;atisfac|tory one if he knows how.&mdash;After this Ob&s;ervation it may be proper to re&s;ume my theatrical Story, which I left off at the Treaty with Mr. <HI>Fl&mdash;t&mdash;d,</HI> to return to <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Hou&s;e, and act under his Patent.</P>
<P>As I had been the chief Per&s;on in rai&s;ing our theatrical <HI>Revolt,</HI> and being of a daring pu&s;hing Temper, I was re|&s;olved to have the principal Share in the <HI>Re&s;toration</HI> of the Company to <HI>Drury-Lane:</HI> I accordingly got my&s;elf nominated as <HI>Plenipo',</HI> and began my Negociations with Mr. <HI>Fl&mdash;t&mdash;d:</HI> How happy I was in my Negociations the Event proved; and as I had to deal with a Per&s;on of Honour and Genero&s;ity, I manag'd the Conduct of the whole Affair in &s;uch a Manner as to make it turn out to <HI>my&s;elf.</HI> In &s;hort, I got a good round Sum of Money out of him; for why &s;hould I <HI>negociate</HI> and <HI>negociate</HI> and get nothing my&s;elf. Some People may &s;mile to &s;ee me, on this Occa&s;ion, compare my&s;elf to another great <HI>Negociator,</HI> and wonder how I and <HI>H&mdash;ce W&mdash;e</HI> can have any Analogy. But pray do you think that he for &s;o many Years has run from <HI>Court</HI> to <HI>Court;</HI> now at the <HI>Hague,</HI> now at <HI>Paris;</HI> negociat|ing here and negociating there, and all for a Joke only? Would any Man do this without the plea&s;ing Recorda|tion of <HI>Place</HI> and <HI>Pen&s;ion?</HI> In Truth my Friend <HI>H&mdash;,</HI> as well as my&s;elf, was a little mov'd by Self Intere&s;t: Be&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">s, our Negociations have been &s;ome what alike; for mine, in &s;act, was a patch'd up Affair, and I did not &s;o much con&s;ult the Intere&s;t of my Ma&s;ter, as

<P>When I had concluded this Treaty with Mr. <HI>Fl&mdash;t&mdash;d,</HI> &s;o advantageous for the Company, and more particular|ly in a private Manner to my&s;elf, we remov'd Bag and Bagage from the <HI>Hay-Market</HI> and return'd to our old Camp at <HI>Drury-Lane:</HI> Our Government was then thought to be fixed in a peaceable Manner; every Thing went on with great Succe&s;s, and I took Care to be &s;o much in the Ma&s;ter's Favour, that in the Direction of the Theat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e I was a kind of Prime Mini&s;ter: I &s;ay a kind of Prime Mini&s;ter, for even then there was another Per&s;on &s;hared amply in his Confidence, and by whom he was chiefly advi&s;ed. When I found out this, I was not a little nettled; a Jealou&s;y rai&s;ed various Sentiments in my Brea&s;t; for, like <HI>Pompey</HI> the Great, my Soul di&s;dain'd the Thought of an Equal. Glory and Power are the darling Pa&s;&s;ions of my Heart; and not to enjoy either of them was, to &s;o jealous an Am|bition, a meer Shade to my Laurels. My Competitor
<PB N="103" REF="110">
was the Per&s;on who had been concern'd for Mrs. <HI>Wilks,</HI> and who thought him&s;elf to have an admirable Talent for theatric Affairs. This Talent was to compo&s;e <HI>Pan|tomimes,</HI> furbi&s;h up old Tricks, and make what he call'd Entertainments: As a Specimen of what Notion he had of the Dignity of the Stage, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that his Genius turn'd to the mon&s;trous and the mar|vellous; for which Rea&s;on nothing could be brought to Town to be exhibited to the Vulgar, but he was for having it exhibited on the Stage: There was a Fellow of an enormous Height came from <HI>Germany</HI> to be &s;hewn for a Sight, call'd <HI>Mynheer Cajanus:</HI> Such a Spectacle, proper enough for a <HI>Smithfield</HI> or <HI>Moorfields</HI> Booth, was thought a proper Per&s;onage to grace the Theatre Royal. Accordingly Negociations were begun; but to my Honour be it &s;poke, I had no Concern in them: I was kept out of the Secret, nor was I much affected that I was &s;o. I and his Grace the Duke of <HI>A&mdash;le,</HI> in this Re&s;pect, may be &s;aid to have the &s;ame Notion of Things: His late Speech on the State of the Nation &s;hows that he was out of the Secret, in Regard to the Conduct of Affairs, and, as he thinks them wrong, was proud that none of them could be laid to his Charge: though I and that illu&s;trious Per&s;on differ in other Sen|timents in Regard to the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, yet I am proud that in this Point he agrees with me.&mdash;But to the Hi&s;tory: <HI>Mynheer</HI> &s;oon agreed to &s;ome very advan|tageous Terms propo&s;ed to him; was with all Secrecy convey'd into <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Theatre, and was &s;oon &s;hown ari&s;ing from a Trap-Door, to the no &s;mall Admiration of the Spectators, and the no &s;mall Joy of my Co-Rival. Nothing could give me and my Brethren, both of the Buskin and the Sock, who had any Regard for that School of Honour and Virtue, the Stage, more &s;ecret Indignation than to &s;ee it pro&s;tituted in &s;o ignominious a Manner: And what &s;till added to our Re&s;entment was the con&s;ummate Folly of the Town, who crouded to the Hou&s;e a great Number of Nights to &s;ee the <HI>Tall Man.</HI> But I had yet other Rea&s;ons to be no Friend to this <HI>Tall Man.</HI> It regretted my Soul, frequently and oft, when on Buskins a Foot and a half high I was to per&s;onate a great Heroe, and had my wavy Plume high o'er my

<P>Now I was not hardy enough to make any publick Remon&s;trances on this Occa&s;ion; for I had a Point to carry, which was to fix my Wife's Character as an Actre&s;s, who&s;e fir&s;t Performance was to be clo&s;ed with the&s;e <HI>Sadler</HI>'s <HI>Wells Tumblers:</HI> On this Account it was my Bu&s;ine&s;s to be as well with the <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> as po&s;&s;ible; and, though I from my Soul abhor'd &s;uch Mea&s;ures, yet no one was more bu&s;tling and commendatory in the De&s;ign than my&s;elf: By this I not only &s;how'd an At|tachment to his Intere&s;t, but kept my&s;elf on good Terms with the other Mini&s;ter: But had I thought it would have been any <HI>Gain</HI> to me, to have <HI>di&s;tre&s;s'd</HI> the Ma&s;ter by making any Remon&s;trances, my Father's <HI>Hardine&s;s</HI> &s;hould not have come up to mine; for I would not have gone &s;neaking into the Pit in hugger-mugger: Not I truly; But bounce upon the Stage, with blu&s;tering Mood, have &s;talk'd and made a &s;peech, which, with pathetick Air in Words and Action, had repre&s;ented our Di&s;a&s;ters dire; and though they had hi&s;s'd again and yet again, I'd have &s;tood 'em all till they had heard me out.&mdash;On this ingenuous Con|fe&s;&s;ion of how I did act or how I would have acted, &s;ome may &s;ay, <HI>Are the&s;e Principles honourable?

<P>There is a private Anecdote of my Life, which is a Proof how early I imbib'd this convenient Opinion; I have indeed often related it to my theatrical Acquain|tance with much Glee of Heart, and boa&s;tful Satisfac|tion; but as I would be by this Apology, <HI>Toto notus in orbe Theophilus,</HI> I cannot re&s;i&s;t the Temptation of in|&s;erting it in the&s;e my Memoirs. You mu&s;t know, Reader, that even by the Time I had reach'd my eighth Year, my Papa &s;aid I was a &s;ad <HI>young Dog,</HI> and upon &s;ome Prank I had play'd, I was in &s;ome Di&s;grace: It happen'd I went into his Chamber, to endeavour a Re|conciliation one Morning; and as he had gone to Bed in his Cups over Night, he had, I &s;uppos'd, drop'd a couple of Guineas out of his Breeches; be that how it will, I &s;aw the two pretty &s;parkling Rogues lie at the Edge of the Carpet, by his Bed-&s;ide: What does I, but Slap runs to the happy Spot, fell on my Knees, and, like a good and dutiful Child, cried out, in a devout

Tone, <HI>Pray, Father, ble&s;s me, and pray to G&mdash;d to ble&s;s me, and make me his true and faithful Servant for ever and ever,</HI> Amen.&mdash;He, &s;urpris'd at &s;uch a &s;udden Strain of filial Duty, (for I don't believe I ever ask'd him Ble&s;&s;ing twice before in my whole Life) &s;troak'd me down the Head, and bid me ri&s;e, by which Time I had, by Slight of Hand, touch'd the Spankers, and convey'd them &s;nug into my Pocket;&mdash;and he will never have heard of them &s;ince, till he reads this <HI>Apology</HI> for &s;uch an Action; that, as I thought they would be a <HI>Convenience</HI> to me, my <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> was not too dainty to take them.<HI>&mdash;E minimis majora.&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>All this Harangue on my Philo&s;ophy is nece&s;&s;ary, though it may &s;eem odd to many Readers, becau&s;e it is an <HI>apologetical</HI> Defence for every Action of my Life at once: I may indeed illu&s;trate it by more In&s;tances in the Sequel of my Story, but &s;hall now return where this Digre&s;&s;ion began.&mdash;The Company went on un|der Mr. <HI>F&mdash;d</HI> with very great Succe&s;s, equal to the greate&s;t under <HI>Cibber, Wilks,</HI> and <HI>'Booth:</HI> As for me, I was occa&s;ionally more or le&s;s in his Favour and Inte|re&s;t as it &s;uited my own Convenience; for he &s;how'd me many In&s;tances of his Readine&s;s to &s;erve me, and was on all Occa&s;ions prompt and ready to do Acts of <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> and <HI>good Nature.</HI> The Stage was then as well rul'd by <HI>my A&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI> as a Gentleman not brought up to it, cou'd rule it; yet as it was my Opinion, and &s;everal other Players, that <HI>no Gentleman</HI> is proper for the <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> of a <HI>Theatre,</HI> we were not ab&s;olutely contented, and we did not want for <HI>Grumbletonians</HI> in a <HI>theatric Govern|ment.</HI> We knew indeed that our <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> had redeem'd us from a thou&s;and Inconveniencies we had labour'd un|der, gave us our own Terms, but yet we did not look upon him with an equal Eye, and thought that Actors were the only proper and fit Per&s;ons to rule over Actors, and receive all the Profits of a Theatre. The&s;e, I &s;ay, were Maxims that the chiefe&s;t Actors embrac'd, and in|culcated into others, as the fundamental Rights of our Con&s;titution: On this the Company became unea&s;y, and form'd them&s;elves into little Factions, and Cabals, but which could not then have been attended with any ill Con&s;equences to the Patentee. But the&s;e little Murmur|ings
<PB N="108" REF="115">
were greatly heighten'd by the following Event. On the late Act for licen&s;ing the Number of Stages taking Place, Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI>'s Company acting then at <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,</HI> to whom Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> had let it, were oblig'd to break up, and provide for them&s;elves in the acting Companies as well as they could: Mr. <HI>F&mdash;d</HI> on this Occa&s;ion took &s;evera! into <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> and to make Way for them, di&s;mi&s;s'd &s;everal, who had long been appertaining to that Theatre. Mrs. <HI>Giffard</HI> and Mr. <HI>Giffard</HI> were them&s;elves likewi&s;e afterwards en|gag'd. This gave new Unea&s;ine&s;s to the old Stock, for we look'd on them in a contemptible Light; and when the Sea&s;on came on, and Parts were ca&s;t to the&s;e <HI>exotic</HI> Actors, &s;till more and more murmuring Taunts and Jea|lou&s;ies aro&s;e. The Ma&s;ter favour'd &s;everal of the&s;e ad|ditional Recruits in a particular Manner, and &s;eem'd to make them his Confidents and Favourites. This &s;till made more Faction in our State, till at la&s;t it was divided into two Parties, the <HI>Riff-Raffs,</HI> and the <HI>Scabs.</HI> The fir&s;t were the Ma&s;ter's Party, the latter <HI>mine;</HI> his were as the pre&s;ent Courtiers, and mine as the <HI>Patriots.</HI> The Titles may &s;eem coar&s;e to the Ears of Delicacy, but why not as good and &s;ignificant as the pre&s;ent Names of Di|&s;tinction in <HI>Sweden,</HI> the <HI>Hats</HI> and the <HI>Night-Caps,</HI> or indeed as our own <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory.</HI> Another notable Mark of Di&s;tinction was, the Ma&s;ter's Party in&s;tituted a famous <HI>Club</HI> of <HI>Riff-Raffs,</HI> call'd the <HI>Ox-Cheek-Club;</HI> and this was erected on the Ruins of a Club, which the old <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Company had formerly erected. The&s;e Party-Divi&s;ions are in a theatrical Government as prejudicial to the publick Good, as in a political one. The Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Stage was not follow'd with that Spirit and Alacrity as when Unanimity reigns in the Hearts of the People. I did, I frankly confe&s;s, what a theatrical Patriot &s;hould do, foment all the Di&s;cord, rai&s;e all the Jealou&s;ies, in order, at a proper Time and Sea&s;on, to rai&s;e a Rebellion, and bring about a new Revolution; and the&s;e Sentiments of <HI>Patrioti&s;m</HI> have been &s;ince very &s;erviceable to me in another Re&s;pect, for in my <HI>political E&s;&s;ays,</HI> which I had the Honour to write in Defence of the <HI>Pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration,</HI> I have charg'd all the&s;e Maxims home upon the Gentlemen in

Therefore as &s;oon as my Be|nefit was over, I determin'd, according to an old Prac|tice I had got, of being of no more Service to the Ma&s;ter that Sea&s;on, to appear no more that Year, and indeed no more at all, while he was concern'd there.&mdash;Retiring therefore from <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> into the more a|greeable and convenient Air of <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s,</HI> I flung off the <HI>Comedian,</HI> and commenc'd <HI>Politician;</HI> but as by entering on that Subject, I &s;hall begin a new Farce, it would be more proper to let the Curtain of this Chapter drop here.</P>

In all theatrical as well as political Divi&s;ions, to &s;ucceed in your De&s;ign you mu&s;t go through <HI>thick</HI> and <HI>thin;</HI> the Sword of <HI>Defiance</HI> is drawn, and the Scab|bard mu&s;t be thrown away: Every one who has read <HI>Machiavel</HI> knows the&s;e Tenets are ju&s;tifiable: there|fore whatever <HI>Fal&s;hood, Scandal, Infamy,</HI> and <HI>Ingrati|tude</HI> my <HI>Country Corre&s;pondent</HI> might have contain'd a|gain&s;t Mr. <HI>Fl&mdash;t&mdash;d,</HI> yet it being con&s;i&s;tent with my <HI>pri|vate Views,</HI> no one who knows Men and Things can blame me; for I &s;hall explain my&s;elf by giving &s;ome Rea&s;ons which were then in Embrio, why I &s;o acted.

<PB N="112" REF="119">
therefore any private Intelligence again&s;t the Ma&s;ter, if I could po&s;&s;ibly make it a <HI>political</HI> Concern, would be an Introduction to his Favour, and a&s;&s;i&s;t my future Scheme. An Incident happen'd as favourable as I could wi&s;h: A certain <HI>Iri&s;h Author</HI> was writing a <HI>Tragedy,</HI> which was, by his Friends, who were reckon'd the tiptop Criticks in Town, &s;aid to be a Performance of &s;uch extraordinary Merit, that no Tragedy &s;ince <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Time could equal it, either for the <HI>Sublimity</HI> of the <HI>Ideas,</HI> the <HI>Dignity</HI> of the <HI>Stile,</HI> the <HI>Noblene&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Subject,</HI> and the <HI>Conduct</HI> of the <HI>Scene:</HI> That it was wrote in the Defence of <HI>Freedom,</HI> and had &s;uch Speeches that at that <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> of Time it would run as long as <HI>Cato</HI> had at a|nother particular <HI>Cri&s;is.</HI> This <HI>dainty Tragedy</HI> was the much nois'd, much &s;ub&s;crib'd for GUSTAVUS VASA, written by HENRY BROOKE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> The Ma&s;ter had great Expectations from it; and though it had been often read in private Company before it was brought to the Hou&s;e; yet I knew little of it till then, as I was look'd upon as a Malecontent to the Ma&s;ter, and con&s;equently out of the Secrets of the Mini&s;try. But as &s;oon as it had been read in the Green-Room, and the Parts deliver'd out to the Actors, and I was acquainted perfectly with the Play, I was determined I would take &s;uch Mea|&s;ures that it &s;hould not be acted; which would &s;hew to the Mini&s;ter what Zeal I had for his Ser|vice, and at the &s;ame Time, indulge that Spirit of Revenge which I had again&s;t the Ma&s;ter. Now what does I, but repre&s;ented to Mr.&mdash;no Mat|ter for his Name&mdash;but it was the proper Per&s;on to make &s;uch an <HI>Information</HI> to, that this &s;ame Tragedy of <HI>Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a</HI> was a &s;candalous Libel again&s;t the Go|vernment, and &s;ome Lines in the Prai&s;e of Liberty were &s;o introduc'd as to make &s;trong <HI>Inuendoes</HI> that the Liber|ty of <HI>England</HI> was in Danger: This I repre&s;ented with &s;uch a Vehemence of Words and Action, that it gain'd Credit, and before it was ready to be perform'd, it was prohibited by my <HI>Lord Chamberlain.</HI> The Prohibition open'd the Mouths and Hearts of the Admirers of this Tragedy, and they talk'd roundly about the Inju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion the Author and the Ma&s;ter of the Play|hou&s;e met with, which they attributed to the Fear the
<PB N="113" REF="120">
Mini&s;try had of its being perform'd on the Stage. Now to give my own impartial Thoughts on this Affair, I avow that I believe there was no Harm in the Play, nor do I think it would have met with that great Succe&s;s as was expected from it; for on the Publication it was not judg'd near equal to the Character that had been given it. However I cannot but make this Ob&s;ervation, that from the Action on the Stage, and the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Scenes and Actors, it might have received &s;uch addi|tional Strength, that it might, by the further Aid of a Party, have had a Run of ten Nights. And here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve again, that it was with great Policy and Pru|dence, that the Mini&s;ter obtain'd the <HI>Licen&s;ing Act,</HI> for though the <HI>Liberty</HI> of the <HI>Pre&s;s</HI> allows a refus'd Play to be printed, yet the Reading of it in the Clo&s;et will not convey an adequate Idea to the Repre&s;entation on a Theatre: Mr. <HI>Colley Cibber,</HI> who is a mo&s;t &s;trenuous <HI>Champion</HI> for the <HI>Licen&s;ing Act,</HI> has fully con&s;ider'd this Difference between a Performance <HI>printed</HI> only, and when it is acted.&mdash;Thus he argues <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>C. Cibber</HI>'s Apology, p. 169.</NOTE>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It was &s;aid that this Re&s;traint upon the Stage would not re|medy the Evil complain'd of: That a Play refus'd to be licens'd would &s;till be printed with double Advan|tage, when it &s;hould be in&s;inuated that it was refus'd for &s;ome Strokes of Wit, and would be more likely then to have its Effect among the People: However natural this Con&s;equence may &s;eem, I doubt it will be very difficult to give a <HI>printed</HI> Satire, or Libel, half the Force or Credit of an <HI>acted</HI> one. The mo&s;t artful or notorious Lye, or &s;train'd Allu&s;ion that ever &s;lander'd a great Man, may be read by &s;ome People with a Smile of Contempt, or at wor&s;t it can but impo&s;e on one Per&s;on at once. But when the Words of the &s;ame plau&s;ible Stuff &s;hall be repeated on a Theatre, the Wit of it among a Crowd of Hearers is liable to be overvalued, and may unite and warm a whole Body of the Malicious and Ignorant into a Plaudit: Nay, the, partial Claps of only twenty ill-minded Per&s;ons among &s;everal hundred of &s;ilent Hearers, &s;hall, and

often have been mi&s;taken for a general Approbation, and frequently draw into their Party the Indifferent or the Inapprehen&s;ive, who rather than not be thought to under&s;tand the Conceit, will laugh with the Laughers, and join in the Triumph! But alas! the quiet Reader of the &s;ame ingenious Matter, can only like for <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> and the Poi&s;on has a much &s;lower Operation upon the Body of a People, when it is &s;o retail'd out, than when told to a full Audience by Whole&s;ale: The &s;ingle Reader too may happen to be a &s;en&s;ible, unprejudic'd Per&s;on, and then the merry Do&s;e, meeting with the Antidote of a &s;ound Judg|ment, perhaps may have no Operation at all: With &s;uch a one the Wit of the mo&s;t ingenious Satire will only, by its intrin&s;ic Truth or Value, gain upon his Ap|probation, or, if it be worth an An&s;wer, a printed Fal&s;hood may po&s;itively be confounded by printed Proofs again&s;t it. But again&s;t Contempt and Scandal heighten'd by the Skill of an Actor, ludicrou&s;ly in|fu&s;ing it into a Multitude, there is no immediate De|fence to be made, or equal Reparation to be had, for it would be but a poor Satisfaction at la&s;t, after lying long patient under the Injury that Time only is to &s;hew which would probably be the Ca&s;e, that the Author of it was a de&s;perate Indigent, that did it for Bread: How much le&s;s dangerous and offen&s;ive then, is the <HI>written</HI> than the acted Scandal? The Impre&s;&s;ion the Comedian gives it, is a Kind of double Stamp in the Poet's Paper, that rai&s;es it ten Times to the in|trin&s;ic Value.<P>Upon the whole; if the Stage ought ever to have been reform'd; if to place a Power &s;omewhere of re&s;training its Immoralities was not incon&s;i&s;tent with the Liberties of a civiliz'd People, (neither of which any moral Man of Sen&s;e can di&s;pute) might it not have &s;hewn a Spirit too poorly prejudic'd to have re|jected &s;o rational a Law, only becau&s;e the Honour and Office of a Mini&s;ter might happen, in &s;ome &s;mall Mea&s;ure, to be protected by it."</P></Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t annotate, that all that is &s;aid here in Refe|rence to comic Satire, and the Comedian, is, <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> equally applicable to the Tragedy and Tragedian: For
<PB N="115" REF="122">
when a mad brain'd tragic Author has &s;tream'd into a Patriotic Stile, pompou&s;ly rolling into vilifying Periods, &s;ignifying roundly nothing, but Invectives again&s;t a Mi|ni&s;ter, the pompous Buskins and Plumes of Tragedy, together with the A&s;pect and Elocution of the Trage|dian, &s;o &s;peak and play with the Imagination, that they deceive the Judgment, and win over many Spectators who might have thought them &s;candalous Bomba&s;t, had they been read &s;oberly in the Clo&s;et. This, as I ob|&s;erv'd, was the Fate of <HI>Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> for after the Prohibition, the Author publi&s;h'd Adverti&s;ements for a Sub&s;cription, aad in tho&s;e Adverti&s;ements made his Cau&s;e the Cau&s;e of the Publick, in&s;inuating it was refus'd for &s;ome Strokes of Liberty, which were di&s;|agreeable to People in Power: This indeed an&s;wer'd his Ends in point of Profit, for being the fir&s;t Play re|fus'd &s;ince the Commencement of the Act, People's Cu|rio&s;ity were rais'd not only by wanting to &s;ee the prohi|bited Play, out of political Rea&s;ons, but becau&s;e it was &s;aid by common Rumour to be a mo&s;t excellent Tra|gedy: The Profit of the Sub&s;cription was equal to what his mo&s;t &s;anguine Hopes might have promis'd him from the Stage. As this may be the mo&s;t proper Place for it, I mu&s;t in&s;ert another Remark on refus'd Plays. After this Succe&s;s of the Sub&s;cription of <HI>Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a,</HI> all the tragic Bards who were under the Influence of Mr. <HI>L&mdash;tt&mdash;t&mdash;n,</HI> Prime Mini&s;ter at <HI>N&mdash;rf&mdash;k</HI> Hou&s;e, threw into bomba&s;t Scenes all the Patriot-Liberty Flights their own little Geniu&s;es could &s;ugge&s;t, or their Patron and Court of A&s;&s;i&s;tants could mu&s;ter up! Some indeed &s;ay they did not, on this Occa&s;ion, in&s;ert any Thing new, but that they had all from the fir&s;t, wrote according to their In&s;tructions, and had fill'd their Scenes with the worn-out, unfa&s;hionable Notions of Liberty and publick Spirit: The next refus'd Plays were the <HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Eleonara,</HI> of Mr. <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI> at <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> and a Tragedy wrote by Mr. <HI>Patti&s;on</HI> at <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> both of which were publi&s;h'd by Sub&s;cription, and adver|tis'd that they fell the Martyrs to Freedom, publick Spi|rit, and the Devil and all: But, as the homely Proverb &s;ays, Enough is as good as a Fea&s;t: The Publick had been cram'd by <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>Gu&s;tavus</HI> to Satiety; and Satiety,

I have acquainted the Reader of &s;ome great De&s;ign which was in Embrio, and which we only wanted an Opportunity to execute: This was for my Father, after having rais'd Unea&s;i|ne&s;&s;es and Jealou&s;ies among Mr. <HI>F&mdash;d</HI>'s Company, to obtain a Licence for a new Company.&mdash;Some private Affairs of Mr. <HI>F&mdash;d</HI>'s gave us the Opportunity we &s;o much de&s;ir'd.&mdash;For as through the Confu&s;ion Things

were at <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Theatre, and through a vio|lent Di&s;temper, he could not appear him&s;elf; and a Report prevailing, which we indu&s;triou&s;ly rumour'd as Truth, that he would never return to the Management of his Theatre again, we could not only the better &s;o|licit the <HI>Actors,</HI> but even the <HI>Chamberlain,</HI> and with le&s;s Oppo&s;ition: To work we went, and indeed we at fir&s;t met with &s;uch hopeful Succe&s;s, that I was not a little elate, and form'd much imaginary Triumph in my Heart. However, Mr. <HI>F&mdash;d</HI> took &s;uch Mea&s;ures as to the Actors, that he thought, maugre all our Projects, he &s;hould be able to retain a good Company at <HI>Drury-Lane:</HI> To traver&s;e this De&s;ign, and with a &s;pecious View of acting ju&s;tly, Mr. <HI>C . . . y C . . . r</HI> repre&s;ented to the L . . d <HI>Ch . . . . n,</HI> that there was an ab&s;olute Nece&s;|&s;ity for having another Company form'd, as Mr. <HI>F . . d</HI> had very injuriou&s;ly treated his chief Actors, and that there were very large Arrears due to them: To impo&s;e &s;till the more on the <HI>Ch . . . n,</HI> there were &s;ome Actors waited on the L . . d <HI>Ch . . . n,</HI> introduced by Mr. <HI>C.

This we look'd, in a Point, gain'd in our Favour, to prevent any Actors making fre&s;h Agreements, which Mr. <HI>F&mdash;d</HI> thought &s;ome Per&s;ons view'd it in another Light, and imagin'd it was to prevent any Actors going <HI>from him.</HI> When the&s;e Ne|gociations were thus carrying on, we had, we thought, another favourable Incident: Mr. <HI>F&mdash;d</HI> was taken ex|tremely ill of the Gout, and he was in &s;uch Danger that his Life was de&s;pair'd of: Nay, it was reported one Night that he was <HI>dead,</HI> and it was in&s;erted as Truth in the <HI>publick Papers</HI> of next Day.

<P><HI>Q&mdash;n</HI> at <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Hou&s;e, and <HI>D-l-ne</HI> at <HI>Covent-Garden,</HI> are the <HI>Per&s;onae Dramatis</HI> which are without Competitors: They both play the chief Characters in the &s;ame Ca&s;t, therefore I &s;hall con&s;ider their different Characters together. <HI>Q&mdash;n</HI> has been many Years on the Stage, and has gradually ro&s;e up to that Height of Re|putation he at pre&s;ent enjoys: When <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Theatre was under the Direction of the late Mr. <HI>Rich,</HI> he was in the inferior Cla&s;s; and the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> of the <HI>Tower</HI> in <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Alteration of <HI>Richard the Third</HI> was one of the principal Parts he perform'd: The Ca&s;t of &s;everal Plays in Print fully prove his Abilities were then thought but very in&s;ignificant; however, on a new Company &s;etting up at <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,</HI> he was engag'd in it, and has ever &s;ince, but more e&s;pecially on the Death of <HI>Boheme,</HI> gradually ro&s;e to a great Degree of Favour with the Publick: Mr. <HI>Booth</HI>'s quitting the Stage &s;till &s;et him in a fairer Light, and indeed left him without a Rival: He had for &s;ome Time appear'd with|out any Competitor, when, all on a &s;udden, there ap|pear'd at <HI>Goodman's-Fields</HI> a young Tragedian from <HI>Dublin:</HI> This was <HI>D. . l. . ne.</HI> Novelty, Youth, a hand|&s;ome Figure, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> took off from any &s;evere Criti|ci&s;m on his Elocution and Action. In &s;hort, though &s;o far from the polite End of the Town, he drew to him &s;everal polite Audiences, and became in &s;uch a Degree of Repute, that Compari&s;ons were made between him and <HI>Q&mdash;n;</HI> nor was he without Admirers of both Sexes who gave him the Preference: He was not in&s;en&s;ible of this, and determin'd to leave <HI>Goodman's-Fields,</HI> and in|dulge his Ambition at one of the Theatres Royal: <HI>Q. . . n</HI> ju&s;t at that Time left <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> for <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> and he engag'd with Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> at <HI>Covent-Garden;</HI> and in two or three Years on the Stage gain'd that Station on it, which mo&s;t of the other Actors could not in many Years attain to. <HI>Q. . . n</HI> has the Character of a ju&s;t Speaker, but then it is confin'd to the &s;olemn de|clamatory Way: He either cannot work him&s;elf into
<PB N="139" REF="146">
the Emotions of a violent Pa&s;&s;ion, or he will not take the Fatigue of doing it: The Partiality of his Friends &s;ays he can touch the Pa&s;&s;ions with great Delicacy <HI>if he will;</HI> but general Opinion affirms he has neither Power of Voice or Sen&s;ation to give Love or Pity, Grief or Remor&s;e their proper Tone and Variation of Features. <HI>D. . l. . ne</HI> is al&s;o e&s;teemed a ju&s;t Player; and though he has often a more loud Violence of Voice, yet, either from an Imitation of <HI>Q. . . n,</HI> or his own natural Manner, he has a Samene&s;s of Tone and Expre&s;&s;ion, and drawls out his Lines to a di&s;plea&s;ing Length: But that loud Violence of Voice is u&s;eful to him when Anger, Indig|nation, or &s;uch enrag'd Pa&s;&s;ions are to be expre&s;s'd; for the &s;hrill Loudne&s;s marks the Pa&s;&s;ion, which the &s;weet Cadence of <HI>Q. . . n</HI>'s natural Voice is unequal to. In &s;uch Parts, e&s;pecially <HI>Alexander, D. . l. . ne</HI> plea&s;es many; for the Million, as <HI>C. C.</HI> &s;ays, are apt to be tran&s;ported when the Drum of the Ear is &s;oundly rattled: But on the contrary, <HI>Q. . . n</HI>'s &s;olemn Samene&s;s of Pronunciation, which conveys an awful Dignity, is charmingly affecting in <HI>Caio. D. . l. . ne</HI> is young enough to ri&s;e to greater Perfection; <HI>Q. . . n</HI> may be &s;aid now to be at the Height of his: If <HI>D. . l. . ne</HI> has the more plea&s;ing Per&s;on, <HI>Q. . . n</HI> has he more affecting Action: Both might &s;oon appear with more Advantage if they were on the &s;ame Stage: The Rival&s;hip of <HI>D. . l. . ne</HI> would give a &s;pirited Jealou&s;y to <HI>Q. . . n,</HI> and force him to exert him&s;elf; and <HI>Q. . . n</HI>'s Judgment would improve the unfini&s;h'd Action of <HI>D. . l. . ne;</HI> but they are the <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Pompey</HI> of the Theatres, and one Stage would be incompatible with their Ambition; <HI>Q. . . n</HI> could bear no one on the Footing as an Equal, <HI>D. . l. . ne</HI> no one as a Superior.</P>
<P><HI>M . . . lw. . . d</HI> is an Actor with all the Happine&s;s of Voice that can be imagin'd, and a Per&s;onage very well turn'd for the Lover or the Heroe; nor, when he is not indolently negligent, does he often betray a Want of Judgment: His Voice is &s;weet, with an uncommon Strength; and in the Decadence of it, there is a Softne&s;s which adapts it to touch the Pa&s;&s;ions of Grief, Love, Pity, or De&s;pair. In Comedy the Ea&s;ine&s;s of his Dialogue in the genteel Characters &s;eems very amiable; and though in
<PB N="140" REF="147">
his Action and Speech he does not imitate that quick &s;nip-&s;nap Catch of the late Mr. <HI>Wilks,</HI> to expre&s;s Spirit and Vigour; yet his Voice and Ge&s;ture &s;how &s;uch a Vivacity as are the ju&s;t Effects of Nature: In low Comedy he has been &s;een to &s;ucceed beyond Expecta|tion; and to &s;peak all in a Word, according to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s De&s;cription of <HI>Mountford,</HI> he is, or might be, the true Repre&s;entative of him.</P>
<P>Of Mr. <HI>William M . . . ls</HI> I have &s;aid &s;omething in a preceding Chapter; all I &s;hall add here is, that he is not excellent in Tragedy, the Inanity of his Voice being unequal to the Swellings and Throws of the Sublime: In Comedy he &s;ucceded to Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s Parts; has caught &s;omething of his Catch in the Voice; is always very bu&s;y on the Stage; and, what all Actors ought to value them&s;elves upon, very perfect.</P>
<P><HI>Griffin</HI> and <HI>Joe Miller</HI> being dead, I &s;hall give no De|&s;criptions of them, nor of tho&s;e who have &s;ucceded to their Parts; for if I &s;hould &s;peak of their Excellencies, I &s;hould be tempted to mention the comparative Inequa|lity of their Succe&s;&s;ors.&mdash;Like the great <HI>Apologi&s;t</HI>'s Method of treating <HI>Verbruggen, Keen, Boheme, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> I &s;hall pa&s;s over the Re&s;t of the pre&s;ent Players as Princes of pett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Fame: I &s;hall therefore only &s;peak of two Actre&s;&s;es, and My&s;elf, and <HI>Colley Cibber</HI> in Parallel.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Cl. . . e</HI> is e&s;teem'd by all an excellent Comic Actre&s;s; and as &s;he has a prodigious Fund of natural Spirit and Humour off the Stage, &s;he makes the mo&s;t of the Poet's on it. Nothing, though ever &s;o barren, even though it exceeds the Limits of Nature, can be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">at in her Hands: She heightens all Characters of Hu|mour &s;he attempts; nor is &s;he confined only to the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">yden</HI> Mi&s;s or pert Chambermaid, but in &s;piritous gay Characters of high Life, &s;he always appears with &s;uch Air, Mein, and Action, as &s;peak the Gay, the Lively, and the De&s;irable. She has been, by Per&s;ons who re|member both, compared to Mrs. <HI>Mount&s;ord;</HI> and, by their natural Talents for the Stage, I am apt to believe the Compari&s;on not unju&s;t: I mu&s;t however ob&s;erve, Mrs. <HI>Mountford</HI> appear'd with great Succe&s;s, <HI>en Cavalier,</HI> and made an adroit pretty Fellow: Mrs. <HI>Cl. . . e</HI> does not
<PB N="141" REF="148">
appear in the&s;e Characters, the concealing Petticoat better &s;uiting with her Turn of Make than the Breeches: It is not from want of Spirit or Judgment to hit off the Fop or the Coxcomb, as &s;he has evidently prov'd in the Ballad &s;he Sings, call'd the <HI>Life of a Beau,</HI> in which her Action and Ge&s;ture is as plea&s;ing as in any Part &s;he per|forms: I could wi&s;h &s;he would never attempt &s;erious Characters in Comedy; and to re&s;ign the Part of <HI>Ophelia</HI> in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> in which &s;he is very unequal to her&s;elf:&mdash;Yet all will allow, that <HI>take her all in all,</HI> &s;he has &s;uch Talents as make her an excellent Actre&s;s.</P>
<P>Though Mrs. <HI>Cl. . . e</HI> is by far the mo&s;t excellent Actre&s;s of the <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> Company, and to &s;peak out the &s;e|vere Judgment of experienc'd Criticks, the only Actre&s;s who has any <HI>Excellence</HI> in it, yet &s;he has a Competitor in Fame at <HI>Covent-Garden:</HI> Mrs. <HI>H. . . t. . . n</HI> &s;tands in the &s;ame Degree of Superiority on this latter Stage, as Mrs. <HI>Cl. . . e</HI> does on the former; but I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that their Talents, Manner, Air, Ge&s;ture, and Ca&s;t of Parts are very different.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>H. . . t. . . n,</HI> though pa&s;t the <HI>heyday</HI> of her <HI>Beauty,</HI> yet betrays &s;o little decay of Youth, that an <HI>inexpre&s;&s;ible Somewhat</HI> in her Air, Face, and Mein throws out &s;uch a Glow of Health and Chearfulne&s;s, that, on the Stage, few Spectators that are not pa&s;t it, can behold her with|out <HI>De&s;ire;</HI> and, in the Fullne&s;s of my Heart I may venture to confe&s;s, that the <HI>De&s;irable</HI> is &s;o predominant in her that my Soul has a <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> or <HI>Tendre</HI> for Mrs. <HI>H. . . t. . . n.</HI> To &s;peak critically of her as an Actre&s;s, in all Parts of a gay Impertinent, or the <HI>Coquette,</HI> &s;he has all the Fe|male Foppery that a giddy, lively, fanta&s;tick Creature can be affected with.&mdash;The Language, Dre&s;s, Motion, and Manners of a <HI>Millamant</HI> &s;eem naturally her own; and I may &s;ay of her, what the great <HI>Apologi&s;t</HI> &s;aid of Mrs. <HI>Bracegirdle</HI> in that Part; that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>C.

It may &s;eem a Matter of Wonder to &s;ome, why they who have been excellent in a Theatre, as <HI>Cibber, Wilks,</HI> and <HI>Booth,</HI> did not bring up young Actors to &s;ucceed them; and this was indeed objected to their Admini&s;tra|tion:&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>C.

<Q><L>His Father's Steps he follows to be great,</L>
<L>But not with equal Pace or equal Fate.</L></Q>
<P>Some future Hi&s;torian may thus write of us: The Father indeed had more of the <HI>Sal Atticum</HI> in his Genius, but then the Son excell'd him in an open hardy Confi|dence of Behaviour: COLLEY'S Conduct in Life was more on the Re&s;erve than THE'S; but by THE'S making a Bu&s;tle in the World, he &s;hew'd a &s;uperior Greatne&s;s of Soul: COLLEY had the cool Calmne&s;s of a de&s;igning Courtier; THE' the frank ra&s;h Spirit of a <HI>young Captain;</HI> The <HI>Father</HI> was the greater <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> the <HI>Son</HI> was the greater <HI>Madman.&mdash;</HI>COLLEY render'd him&s;elf remarkable by his <HI>Fopperies,</HI> THE' by his <HI>Ex|travagancies:</HI> Yet their private Virtues, publick Mo|de&s;ty, and Sentiments of Morality were, in fact, in the

one and the other the &s;ame, though their publick Con|duct was extremely different.&mdash;COLLEY had rather <HI>be</HI> immoral than be e&s;teem'd &s;o; THE' thought it more Glory, the more he acquir'd the Character of being &s;o.&mdash;The Reputation of the one was only founded on private Rumour, but that of the other is on publick Record. In &s;hort, the <HI>Father</HI> had few Equals, the <HI>Son</HI> not <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P>Having brought the Hi&s;tory of the Stage down from the Time my Father left it to the pre&s;ent Vacation, 1740, I can only add, after my Exploits, Hopes, and Ambition, I mu&s;t return to Mr. <HI>Rich,</HI> as an hired Actor, and wait in dudgeon &s;ome more favourable Op|portunity to make my Attempts on the theatric Domi|nions more &s;ucce&s;sful: However tho&s;e Attempts occa|&s;ion'd this Apology, which will tran&s;mit my Name and Character to late Po&s;terity; and I may conclude as <HI>Ovid</HI> does:</P>
