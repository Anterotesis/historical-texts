<HEAD>TO SAMUEL SPAN, <ABBR>ESQ</ABBR> Ma&s;ter of the Society of Mer|chants Adventurers of Bri&s;tol.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with your letter of the 13th, in an&s;wer to mine, which accompanied the re&s;olutions of the Hou&s;e relative to the trade of Ireland.</P>
<P>You will be &s;o good as to pre&s;ent my be&s;t re&s;pects to the Society, and to a&s;&s;ure them, that it was altogether unnece&s;&s;ary to remind me of the intere&s;t of the con|&s;tituents. I have never regarded any thing el&s;e, &s;ince I had a &s;eat in parlia|ment. Having frequently and maturely con&s;idered that intere&s;t, and &s;tated it
<PB N="2" REF="4">
to my&s;elf in almo&s;t every point of view, I am per&s;uaded, that, under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, I cannot more effectually pur&s;ue it, than by giving all the &s;up|port in my power to the propo&s;itions which I lately tran&s;mitted to the Hall.</P>
<P>The fault I find in the &s;cheme is,&mdash; that it falls extremely &s;hort of that li|berality in the commercial &s;y&s;tem, which, I tru&s;t, will one day be adopted. If I had not con&s;idered the pre&s;ent re|&s;olutions, merely as preparatory to bet|ter things, and as a means of &s;hewing experimentally, that ju&s;tice to others is not always folly to our&s;elves, I &s;hould have contented my&s;elf with receiving them in a cold and &s;ilent acquie&s;cence. Separately con&s;idered, they are matters of no very great importance. But they aim, however imperfectly, at a right principle. I &s;ubmit to the re&s;traint to appea&s;e prejudice: I accept the enlarge|ment,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
&s;o far as it goes, as the re&s;ult of rea&s;on and of &s;ound policy.</P>
<P>We cannot be in&s;en&s;ible of the cala|mities which have been brought upon this nation by an ob&s;tinate adherence to narrow and re&s;trictive plans of govern|ment. I confe&s;s, I cannot prevail on my&s;elf to take them up, preci&s;ely at a time, when the mo&s;t deci&s;ive experience has taught the re&s;t of the world to lay them down. The propo&s;itions in que&s;|tion did not originate from me, or from my particular friends. But when things are &s;o right in them&s;elves, I hold it my duty, not to enquire from what hands they come. I oppo&s;ed the American mea&s;ures upon the very &s;ame principle on which I &s;upport tho&s;e that relate to Ireland. I was convinced, that the evils which have ari&s;en from the adoption of the former, would be infinitely aggra|vated by the rejection of the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">Perhaps Gentlemen are not yet fully aware of the &s;ituation of their country, and what its exigencies ab&s;olutely re|quire. I find that we are &s;till di&s;po&s;ed to talk at our ea&s;e, and as if all things were to be regulated by our good plea|&s;ure. I &s;hould con&s;ider it as a fatal &s;ymptom, if, in our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and adver&s;e circum&s;tances, we &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in the errors which are natural only to pro&s;perity. One cannot indeed &s;ufficiently lament the continuance of that &s;pirit of delu&s;ion, by which, for a long time pa&s;t, we have thought fit to mea&s;ure our nece&s;&s;ities by our inclina|tions. Moderation, prudence, and equi|ty, are far more &s;uitable to our condi|tion, than loftine&s;s, and confidence, and rigour. We are threatened by enemies of no &s;mall magnitude, whom, if we think fit, we may de&s;pi&s;e, as we have de&s;pi&s;ed others; but they are enemies
<PB N="5" REF="7">
who can only cea&s;e to be truly formi|dable, by our entertaining a due re&s;pect for their power. Our danger will not be le&s;&s;ened by our &s;hutting our eyes to it; nor will our force abroad be en|crea&s;ed by rendering our&s;elves feeble, and divided at home.</P>
<P>There is a dreadful &s;chi&s;m in the Bri|ti&s;h nation. Since we are not able to reunite the empire, it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to give all po&s;&s;ible vigour and &s;oundne&s;s to tho&s;e parts of it which are &s;till con|tent to be governed by our councils. Sir, it is proper to inform you, that our mea&s;ures <HI>mu&s;t be healing.</HI> Such a degree of &s;trength mu&s;t be communicated to all the members of the &s;tate, as may enable them to defend them&s;elves, and to co-operate in the defence of the whole. Their temper too mu&s;t be ma|naged, and their good affections culti|vated. They may then be di&s;po&s;ed to
<PB N="6" REF="8">
bear the load with chearfulne&s;s, as a contribution towards what may be call|ed with truth and propriety, and not by an empty form of words, <HI>a common cau&s;e.</HI> Too little dependence cannot be had, at this time of day, on names and prejudices. The eyes of mankind are opened; and communities mu&s;t be held together by an evident and &s;olid inte|re&s;t. God forbid, that our conduct &s;hould demon&s;trate to the world, that Great Britain can, in no in&s;tance what|&s;oever, be brought to a &s;en&s;e of rational and equitable policy, but by coercion and force of arms!</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you to recollect, with what powers of conce&s;&s;ion, relatively to com|merce, as well as to legi&s;lation, his Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ioners to the United Colonies have &s;ailed from England with|in this week. Whether the&s;e powers are &s;ufficient for their purpo&s;es, it is not
<PB N="7" REF="9">
now my bu&s;ine&s;s to examine. But we all know, that our re&s;olutions in favour of Ireland are trifling and in&s;ignificant, when compared with the conce&s;&s;ions to the Americans. At &s;uch a juncture, I would implore every man, who retains the lea&s;t &s;park of regard to the yet re|maining honour and &s;ecurity of this country, not to compel others to an imitation of their conduct; or by pa&s;|&s;ion and violence, to force them to &s;eek in the territories of the &s;eparation, that freedom, and tho&s;e advantages, which they are not to look for whil&s;t they re|main under the wings of their ancient government.</P>
<P>After all, what are the matters we di&s;pute with &s;o much warmth? Do we in the&s;e re&s;olutions <HI>be&s;tow</HI> any thing upon Ireland? Not a &s;hilling. We only con&s;ent to <HI>leave</HI> to them, in two or three in&s;tances, the u&s;e of the natu|ral
<PB N="8" REF="10">
faculties which God has given to them, and to all mankind. Is Ireland united to the crown of Great Britain for no other purpo&s;e, than that we &s;hould counteract the bounty of Provi|dence in her favour? And in propor|tion as that bounty has been liberal, that we are to regard it as an evil, which is to be met with in every &s;ort of cor|rective? To &s;ay that Ireland interferes with us, and therefore mu&s;t be checked, is, in my opinion, a very mi&s;taken, and a very dangerous principle. I mu&s;t beg leave to repeat, what I took the liberty of &s;ugge&s;ting to you in my la&s;t letter, that Ireland is a country, in the &s;ame climate, and of the &s;ame natural qua|lities and productions, with this; and has con&s;equently no other means of growing wealthy in her&s;elf, or, in other words, of being u&s;eful to us, but by doing the very &s;ame things which we
<PB N="9" REF="11">
do, for the &s;ame purpo&s;es. I hope that in Great Britain we &s;hall always pur|&s;ue, without exception, <HI>every</HI> means of pro&s;perity; and of cour&s;e, that Ireland <HI>will</HI> interfere with us in &s;omething or other; for either, in order to <HI>limit</HI> her, we <HI>mu&s;t re&s;train</HI> our&s;elves, or we mu&s;t fall into that &s;hocking conclu&s;ion, that we are to keep our yet remaining de|pendency, under a general and indi&s;|criminate re&s;traint, for the mere pur|po&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion. Indeed, Sir, Eng|land and Ireland may flouri&s;h together. The world is large enough for us both. Let it be our care, not to make our|&s;elves too little for it.</P>
<P>I know it is &s;aid, that the people of Ireland do not pay the &s;ame taxes, and therefore ought not in equity to enjoy the &s;ame benefits with this. I had hopes, that the unhappy phantom of a compul&s;ory <HI>equal taxation</HI> had haunted
<PB N="10" REF="12">
us long enough. I do a&s;&s;ure you, that until it is entirely bani&s;hed from our imaginations, (where alone it has, or can have any exi&s;tence,) we &s;hall never cea&s;e to do our&s;elves the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tan|tial injuries. To that argument of equal taxation, I can only &s;ay,&mdash;that Ireland pays as many taxes, as tho&s;e who are the be&s;t judges of her powers, are of opinion &s;he can bear. To bear more &s;he mu&s;t have more ability; and in the order of nature, the advantage mu&s;t <HI>precede</HI> the charge. This di&s;po&s;i|tion of things, being the law of God, neither you nor I <HI>can</HI> alter it. So that if you will have more help from Ireland, you mu&s;t <HI>previou&s;ly</HI> &s;upply her with more means. I believe it will be found, that if men are &s;uffered freely to cultivate their natural advantages, a vir|tual equality of contribution will come in its own time, and will flow by an
<PB N="11" REF="13">
ea&s;y de&s;cent, through its own proper and natural channels. An attempt to di&s;turb that cour&s;e, and to force nature, will only bring on univer&s;al di&s;content, di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>You tell me, Sir, that you prefer an union with Ireland to the little regula|tions which are propo&s;ed in Parliament. This union is a great que&s;tion of &s;tate, to which, when it comes properly be|fore me in my parliamentary capacity, I &s;hall give an hone&s;t and unprejudiced con&s;ideration. However, it is a &s;ettled rule with me, to make the mo&s;t of my <HI>actual &s;ituation</HI>; and not to refu&s;e to do a proper thing, becau&s;e there is &s;ome|thing el&s;e more proper, which I am not able to do. This union is a bu&s;ine&s;s of difficulty; and on the principles of your letter, a bu&s;ine&s;s impracticable. Until it can be matured into a fea&s;ible and de&s;irable &s;cheme, I wi&s;h to have as
<PB N="12" REF="14">
clo&s;e an union of intere&s;t and affection with Ireland, as I can have; and that, I am &s;ure, is a far better thing than any nominal union of government.</P>
<P>France, and indeed mo&s;t exten&s;ive empires, which by various de&s;igns and fortunes have grown into one great ma&s;s, contain many Provinces that are very different from each other in pri|vileges and modes of government; and they rai&s;e their &s;upplies in different ways; in different proportions; and under dif|ferent authorities; yet none of them are for this rea&s;on, curtailed of their natu|ral rights; but they carry on trade and manufactures with perfect equality. In &s;ome way or other the true balance is found; and all of them are properly poi&s;ed and harmoni&s;ed. How much have you lo&s;t by the participation of Scotland in all your commerce? The external trade of England has more than doubled
<PB N="13" REF="15">
&s;ince that period; and I believe your internal (which is the mo&s;t advantage|ous) has been augmented at lea&s;t four|fold. Such virtue there is in liberality of &s;entiment, that you have grown richer even by the partner&s;hip of poverty.</P>
<P>If you think, that this participation was a lo&s;s, commercially con&s;idered, but that it has been compen&s;ated by the &s;hare which Scotland has taken in defraying the public charge&mdash;I believe you have not very carefully looked at the public accounts. Ireland, Sir, pays a great deal more than Scotland; and is perhaps as much, and as effectually united to England as Scotland is. But if Scot|land, in&s;tead of paying little, had paid nothing at all, we &s;hould be gainers, not lo&s;ers by acquiring the hearty co-opera|tion of an active intelligent people, to|wards the increa&s;e of the common &s;tock; in&s;tead of our being employed in watch|ing
<PB N="14" REF="16">
and counteracting them, and their being employed in watching and coun|teracting us, with the peevi&s;h and chur|li&s;h jealou&s;y of rivals and enemies on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, Sir, that the commercial experience of the merchants of Bri&s;tol, will &s;oon di&s;abu&s;e them of the preju|dice, that they can trade no longer, if countries more lightly taxed, are per|mitted to deal in the &s;ame commodities at the &s;ame markets. You know, that in fact, you trade very largely where you are met by the goods of all nations. You even pay high duties, on the im|port of your goods, and afterwards un|der&s;ell nations le&s;s taxed, at their own markets; and where goods of the &s;ame kind are not charged at all. If it were otherwi&s;e, you could trade very little. You know, that the price of all &s;orts of manufacture is not a great deal in|hanced,
<PB N="15" REF="17">
(except to the dome&s;tic con|&s;umer) by any taxes paid in this country. This I might very ea&s;ily prove.</P>
<P>The &s;ame con&s;ideration will relieve you from the apprehen&s;ion you expre&s;s, with relation to &s;ugars, and the difference of the duties paid here and in Ireland. Tho&s;e duties affect the interior con&s;umer only; and for obvious rea&s;ons, rela|tive to the intere&s;t of revenue it&s;elf, they mu&s;t be proportioned to his ability of payment; but in all ca&s;es in which &s;u|gar can be an <HI>object of commerce,</HI> and therefore (in this view) of rival&s;hip, you are &s;en&s;ible, that you are at lea&s;t on a par with Ireland. As to your appre|hen&s;ions concerning the more advan|tageous &s;ituation of Ireland, for &s;ome branches of commerce, (for it is &s;o but for &s;ome) I tru&s;t you will not find them more &s;erious. Millford Haven, which is at your door, may &s;erve to &s;hew you,
<PB N="16" REF="18">
that the mere advantage of ports is not the thing which &s;hifts the &s;eat of com|merce from one part of the world to the other. If I thought you inclined to take up this matter on local con|&s;iderations, I &s;hould &s;tate to you, that I do not know any part of the king|dom &s;o well &s;ituated for an advantage|ous commerce with Ireland as Bri&s;tol; and that none would be &s;o likely to profit of its pro&s;perity as our city. But your profit and theirs mu&s;t concur. Beg|gary and bankruptcy are not the cir|cum&s;tances which invite to an inter|cour&s;e with that or with any country; and I believe it will be found invariably true, that the &s;uperfluities of a rich na|tion furni&s;h a better object of trade than the nece&s;&s;ities of a poor one. It is the intere&s;t of the commercial world that wealth &s;hould be found every where.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">The true ground of fear, in my opi|nion is this; that Ireland, from the vi|tious &s;y&s;tem of its internal polity, will be a long time before it can derive any benefit from the liberty now granted, or from any thing el&s;e. But as I do not vote advantages, in hopes that they may not be enjoyed, I will not lay any &s;tre&s;s upon this con&s;ideration. I rather wi&s;h, that the Parliament of Ireland may, in its own wi&s;dom, remove the&s;e impedi|ments, and put their country in a con|dition to avail it&s;elf of its natural ad|vantages. If they do not, the fault is with them, and not with us.</P>
<P>I have written this long letter, in or|der to give all po&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction to my con&s;tituents with regard to the part I have taken in this affair. It gave me inexpre&s;&s;ible concern to find, that my conduct had been a cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s to any of them. Next to my honour
<PB N="18" REF="20">
and con&s;cience, I have nothing &s;o near and dear to me as their approbation. However, I had much rather run the ri&s;que of di&s;plea&s;ing than of injuring them;&mdash;if I am driven to make &s;uch an option. You obligingly lament, that you are not to have me for your advo|cate; but if I had been capable of act|ing as an advocate in oppo&s;ition to a plan &s;o perfectly con&s;onant to my known principles, and to the opinions I had publicly declared on an hundred occa|&s;ions, I &s;hould only di&s;grace my&s;elf, without &s;upporting with the &s;malle&s;t degree of credit or effect, the cau&s;e you wi&s;hed me to undertake. I &s;hould have lo&s;t the only thing which can make &s;uch abilities as mine of any u&s;e to the world now or hereafter; I mean that autho|rity which is derived from an opinion, that a member &s;peaks the language of truth and &s;incerity; and that he is not
<PB N="19" REF="21">
ready to take up or lay down a great political &s;y&s;tem for the convenience of the hour; that he is in parliament to &s;upport his opinion of the public good, and does not form his opinion in order to get into parliament, or to continue in it. It is in a great mea&s;ure for your &s;ake, that I wi&s;h to pre&s;erve this cha|racter. Without it, I am &s;ure, I &s;hould be ill able to di&s;charge, by any &s;ervice, the &s;malle&s;t part of that debt of grati|tude and affection, which I owe you for the great and honourable tru&s;t you have repo&s;ed in me. I am, with the highe&s;t regard and e&s;teem,</P>

<HEAD>COPY OF A LETTER TO Me&s;&s;. ******* ****** and Co. Bri&s;tol.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT gives me the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible con|cern to find, that my vote on the re&s;olutions relative to the trade of Ireland, has not been fortunate enough to meet with your approbation. I have explained at large the grounds of my conduct on that occa&s;ion in my letters to the Merchants Hall: but my very &s;incere regard and e&s;teem for you will not permit me to let the matter pa&s;s without an explanation, which is par|ticular to your&s;elves, and which, I hope, will prove &s;atisfactory to you.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">You tell me, that the conduct of your late member is not much wondered at; but you &s;eem to be at a lo&s;s to account for mine; and you lament, that I have taken &s;o decided a part <HI>again&s;t</HI> my con|&s;tituents.</P>
<P>This is rather an heavy imputation. Does it then really appear to you, that the propo&s;itions, to which you refer, are, on the face of them, &s;o manife&s;tly wrong, and &s;o certainly injurious to the trade and manufactures of Great Bri|tain, and particularly to yours, that no man could think of propo&s;ing, or &s;up|porting them, except from re&s;entment to you, or from &s;ome other oblique mo|tive? If you &s;uppo&s;e your late mem|ber, or if you &s;uppo&s;e me, to act upon other rea&s;ons than we choo&s;e to avow, to what do you attribute the conduct of the <HI>other</HI> members, who in the begin|ning almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly adopted tho&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="24">
re&s;olutions? To what do you attribute the &s;trong part taken by the mini&s;ters, and along with the mini&s;ters, by &s;eve|ral of their mo&s;t declared opponents? This does not indicate a mini&s;terial jobb; a party de&s;ign; or a provincial or local purpo&s;e. It is therefore not &s;o ab&s;olutely clear, that the mea&s;ure is wrong, or likely to be injurious to the true intere&s;ts of any place, or any per|&s;on.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on, gentlemen, for taking this &s;tep, at this time, is but too obvious and too urgent. I cannot imagine, that you forget the great war, which has been carried on with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s (and, as I thought, with &s;o little policy) in America; or that you are not aware of the other great wars which are im|pending. Ireland has been called upon to repel the attacks of enemies of no &s;mall power, brought upon her by coun|cils,
<PB N="23" REF="25">
in which &s;he has had no &s;hare. The very purpo&s;e and declared object of that original war, which has brought other wars, and other enemies on Ire|land, was not very flattering to her dig|nity, her intere&s;t, or to the very prin|ciple of her liberty. Yet &s;he &s;ubmitted patiently to the evils &s;he &s;uffered from an attempt to &s;ubdue to <HI>your</HI> obedience, countries who&s;e very commerce was not open to her. America was to be con|quered, in order that Ireland &s;hould <HI>not</HI> trade thither; whil&s;t the mi&s;erable trade which &s;he is permitted to carry on to other places has been torn to pieces in the &s;truggle. In this &s;ituation, are we neither to &s;uffer her to have any real in|tere&s;t in our quarrel, or to be flattered with the hope of any future means of bearing the burthens which &s;he is to incurr in defending her&s;elf again&s;t ene|mies which we have brought upon her?</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="26">I cannot &s;et my face again&s;t &s;uch ar|guments. Is it quite fair to &s;uppo&s;e, that I have no other motive for yield|ing to them, but a de&s;ire of acting <HI>again&s;t</HI> my con&s;tituents? It is for <HI>you,</HI> and for <HI>your</HI> intere&s;t, as a dear, che|ri&s;hed, and re&s;pected part of a valuable whole, that I have taken my &s;hare in this que&s;tion. You do not, you cannot &s;uffer by it. If hone&s;ty be true policy with regard to the tran&s;ient intere&s;t of individuals, it is much more certainly &s;o with regard to the permanent inte|re&s;ts of communities. I know, that it is but too natural for us to &s;ee our own <HI>certain</HI> ruin, in the <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> pro&s;perity of other people. It is hard to per&s;uade us, that every thing which is <HI>got</HI> by another is not <HI>taken</HI> from our&s;elves. But it is fit, that we &s;hould get the better of the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, which come from what is not the be&s;t and &s;ounde&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="27">
part of our nature, and that we &s;hould form to our&s;elves a way of thinking, more ra|tional, more ju&s;t, and more religious. Trade is not a limited thing; as if the objects of mutual demand and con|&s;umption, could not &s;tretch beyond the bounds of our jealou&s;ies. God has given the earth to the children of men, and he has undoubtedly, in giving it to them, given them what is abundantly &s;ufficient for all their exigencies; not a &s;canty, but a mo&s;t liberal provi&s;ion for them all. The Author of our nature has written it &s;trongly in that nature, and has promulgated the &s;ame law in his written word, that man &s;hall eat his bread by his labour; and I am per|&s;uaded, that no man, and no combina|tion of men, for their own ideas of their particular profit, can, without great impiety, undertake to &s;ay, that he <HI>&s;hall not</HI> do &s;o; that they have no
<PB N="26" REF="28">
&s;ort of right, either to prevent the la|bour, or to withhold the bread. Ire|land having received no <HI>compen&s;ation,</HI> directly or indirectly, for any re&s;traints on their trade, ought not, in ju&s;tice or common hone&s;ty, be made &s;ubject to &s;uch re&s;traints. I do not mean to im|peach the right of the parliament of Great Britain, to make laws for the trade of Ireland. I only &s;peak of what laws it is right for Parliament to make.</P>
<P>It is nothing to an oppre&s;&s;ed people, to &s;ay that in part they are protected at our charge. The military force which &s;hall be kept up in order to cramp the na|tural faculties of a people, and to pre|vent their arrival to their utmo&s;t pro&s;|perity, is the in&s;trument of their &s;ervi|tude not the means of their protection. To protect men, is to forward, and not to re&s;train their improvement. El&s;e, what is it more, than to avow to them,

and to the world, that you guard them from others, only to make them a prey to your&s;elf. This fundamental nature of protection does not belong to free, but to all governments; and is as valid in Turkey as in Great Britain. No go|vernment ought to own that it exi&s;ts for the purpo&s;e of checking the pro&s;perity of its people, or that there is &s;uch a principle involved in its policy.</P>
<P>Under the impre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e &s;enti|ments, (and not as wanting every at|tention to my con&s;tituents, which af|fection and gratitude could in&s;pire,) I voted for the&s;e bills which give you &s;o much trouble. I voted for them, not as doing complete ju&s;tice to Ireland, but as being &s;omething le&s;s unju&s;t than the general prohibition which has hi|therto prevailed. I hear &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e, as if in one or two paltry duties on mate|rials, Ireland had a preference; and that

tho&s;e who &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t this act of &s;canty ju&s;tice, a&s;&s;ert that they are only contending for an <HI>equality.</HI> What equality? Do they forget, that the whole woollen manufacture of Ire|land, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and profitable of any, and the natural &s;taple of that kingdom, has been in a manner &s;o de|&s;troyed by re&s;trictive laws of ours, and (at our per&s;ua&s;ion, and on our pro|mi&s;es) by re&s;trictive laws of <HI>their own,</HI> that in a few years, it is probable, they will not be able to wear a coat of their own fabric. Is this equality? Do gentlemen forget, that the under&s;tood faith upon which they were per&s;uaded to &s;uch an unnatural act, has not been kept; but a linen-manufacture has been &s;et up, and highly encouraged, again&s;t them? Is this equality? Do they for|get the &s;tate of the trade of Ireland in beer, &s;o great an article of con&s;umption,
<PB N="29" REF="31">
and which now &s;tands in &s;o mi&s;chievous a po&s;ition with regard to their revenue, their manufacture, and their agricul|ture? Do they find any equality in all this? Yet if the lea&s;t &s;tep is taken to|wards doing them common ju&s;tice in the lighte&s;t articles for the mo&s;t limited markets, a cry is rai&s;ed, as if we were going to be ruined by partiality to Ire|land.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, I know that the defi|ciency in the&s;e arguments is made up (not by you, but by others) by the u&s;ual re&s;ource on &s;uch occa&s;ions, the confi|dence in military force, and &s;uperior power. But that ground of confidence, which at no time was perfectly ju&s;t, or the avowal of it tolerably decent, is at this time very un&s;ea&s;onable. Late ex|perience has &s;hewn, that it cannot be altogether relied upon; and many, if not all our pre&s;ent difficulties, have
<PB N="30" REF="32">
ari&s;en from putting our tru&s;t in what may very po&s;&s;ibly fail; and if it &s;hould fail, leaves tho&s;e who are hurt by &s;uch a reliance, without pity. Whereas ho|ne&s;ty and ju&s;tice, rea&s;on and equity, go a very great way in &s;ecuring pro&s;perity to tho&s;e who u&s;e them; and in ca&s;e of failure, &s;ecure the be&s;t retreat, and the mo&s;t honourable con&s;olations.</P>
<P>It is very unfortunate, that we &s;hould con&s;ider tho&s;e as rivals, whom we ought to regard as fellow-labourers in a com|mon cau&s;e. Ireland has never made a &s;ingle &s;tep in its progre&s;s towards pro&s;pe|rity, by which you have not had a &s;hare, and perhaps the greate&s;t &s;hare, in the benefit. That progre&s;s has been chief|ly owing to her own natural advantages, and her own efforts, which, after a long time, and by &s;low degrees, have prevailed in &s;ome mea&s;ure over the mi&s;|chievous &s;y&s;tems which have been ad|opted.
<PB N="31" REF="33">
Far enough &s;he is &s;till from having arrived even at an ordinary &s;tate of perfection; and if our jealou&s;ies were to be converted into politics, as &s;y&s;te|matically as &s;ome would have them, the trade of Ireland would vani&s;h out of the &s;y&s;tem of commerce. But, believe me, if Ireland is beneficial to you, it is &s;o not from the parts in which it is re|&s;trained, but from tho&s;e in which it is left free, though not left unrivalled. The greater its freedom, the greater mu&s;t be your advantage. If you &s;hould lo&s;e in one way, you will gain in twenty.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I remain under this unalter|able and powerful conviction, you will not wonder at the <HI>decided</HI> part I take. It is my cu&s;tom &s;o to do, when I &s;ee my way clearly before me; and when I know, that I am not mi&s;led by any pa&s;|&s;ion, or any per&s;onal intere&s;t; which in this ca&s;e, I am very &s;ure, I am not. I

find that di&s;agreeable things are circu|lated among my con&s;tituents; and I wi&s;h my &s;entiments, which form my ju&s;tification, may be equally general with the circulation again&s;t me. I have the honour to be, with the greate&s;t re|gard and e&s;teem,</P>
