The book&s;eller &s;aid he had not a &s;et in the world&mdash;<HI>Comment!</HI> &s;aid I; taking one up out of a &s;et which lay upon the counter betwixt us.&mdash;He &s;aid, they were &s;ent him only to be got bound, and were to be &s;ent back to Ver&s;ailles in the morning to the Count de B****.</P>
<P>&mdash;And does the Count de B**** &s;aid I, read Shake&s;pear? <HI>C'e&s;t un E&s;prit fort;</HI> replied the book&s;eller.&mdash;He loves Engli&s;h books; and what is more to his honour, Mon&s;ieur, he love the Engli&s;h too. You &s;peak this &s;o civilly, &s;aid I, that 'tis enough to oblige an Engli&s;hman to lay out a Louis d'or or two at your &s;hop&mdash;the book&s;eller made a bow, and was
<PB N="3" REF="5">
going to &s;ay &s;omething, when a young decent girl of about twenty, who by her air and dre&s;s, &s;eemed to be <HI>fille de chambre</HI> to &s;ome devout woman of fa&s;hion, came into the &s;hop and a&s;ked for <HI>Les Egarments du Coeur &amp; de l'E&s;|prit:</HI> the book&s;eller gave her the book directly; &s;he pulled out a little green &s;attin pur&s;e run round with a ribband of the &s;ame colour, and putting her finger and thumb into it, &s;he took out the money, and paid for it. As I had no|thing more to &s;tay me in the &s;hop, we both walked out at the door together.</P>
<P>&mdash;And what have you to do, my dear, &s;aid I, with <HI>The Wanderings of the Heart,</HI> who &s;carce know yet you have one? nor till love has
<PB N="4" REF="6">
fir&s;t told you it, or &s;ome faithle&s;s &s;hepherd has made it ache, can'&s;t thou ever be &s;ure it is &s;o.&mdash;<HI>Le Dieu m'en guard!</HI> &s;aid the girl.&mdash;With rea&s;on, &s;aid I&mdash;for if is a good one, 'tis pity it &s;hould be &s;tolen: 'tis a little trea|&s;ure to thee, and gives a better air to your face, than if it was dre&s;s'd out with pearls.</P>
<P>The young girl li&s;tened with a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive attention, holding her &s;at|tin pur&s;e by its ribband in her hand all the time&mdash;'Tis a very &s;mall one, &s;aid I, taking hold of the bottom of it&mdash;&s;he held it towards me&mdash;and there is very little in it, my dear, &s;aid I; but be but as good as thou art hand|&s;ome, and heaven will fill it: I had a
<PB N="5" REF="7">
parcel of crowns in my hand to pay for Shake&s;pear; and as &s;he had let go the pur&s;e intirely, I put a &s;ingle one in; and tying up the ribband in a bow-knot, returned it to her.</P>
<P>The young girl made me more a humble courte&s;y than a low one&mdash;'twas one one of tho&s;e quiet, thankful &s;inkings where the &s;pirit bows it&s;elf down&mdash;the body does no more than tell it. I never gave a girl a crown in my life which gave me half the plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>My advice, my dear, would not have been worth a pin to you, &s;aid I, if I had not given this along with it: but now, when you &s;ee the crown,
<PB N="6" REF="8">
you'll remember it&mdash;&s;o don't, my dear, lay it out in ribbands.</P>
<P>Upon my word, Sir, &s;aid the girl, earne&s;tly, I am incapable&mdash;in &s;aying which, as is u&s;ual in little bar|gains of honour, &s;he gave me her hand&mdash;<HI>En verite, Mon&s;ieur, je met|trai cet argent apart,</HI> &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>When a virtuous convention is made betwixt man and woman, it &s;anctifies their mo&s;t private walks: &s;o notwith&s;tanding it was du&s;ky, yet as both our roads lay the &s;ame way, we made no &s;cruple of walking along the Quai de Conti together</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="9">
She made me a &s;econd courte&s;y in &s;etting off, and before we got twenty yards from the door, as if &s;he had not done enough before, &s;he made a &s;ort of a little &s;top to tell me again,&mdash;&s;he thank'd me.</P>
<P>It was a &s;mall tribute, I told her, which I could not avoid paying to virtue, and would not be mi&s;taken in the per&s;on I had been rendering it to for the world&mdash;but I &s;ee innocence, my dear, in your face&mdash;and foul be|fal the man who ever lays a &s;nare in its way!</P>
<P>The girl &s;eem'd affected &s;ome way or other with what I &s;aid&mdash;&s;he gave a low &s;igh&mdash;I found I was not im|powered

to enquire at all after it&mdash;&s;o &s;aid nothing more till I got to the corner of the Rue de Nevers, where we were to part.</P>
<P>&mdash;But is this the way, my dear, &s;aid I, to the hotel de Modene? &s;he told me it was&mdash;or, that I might go by the Rue de Guineygaude, which was the next turn.&mdash;Then I'll go, my dear, by the Rue de Guineygaude, &s;aid I, for two rea&s;ons; fir&s;t I &s;hall plea&s;e my&s;elf, and next I &s;hall give you the protection of my company as far on your way as I can. The girl was &s;en&s;ible I was civil&mdash;and &s;aid, &s;he wi&s;h'd the hotel de Modene was in the Rue de St. Pierre&mdash;You live there? &s;aid I.&mdash;She told me &s;he was <HI>fille de chambre</HI> to Madame

R****&mdash;Good God! &s;aid I, 'tis the very lady for whom I have brought a letter from Amiens&mdash;The girl told me that Madame R****, &s;he believed expected a &s;tranger with a letter, and was impatient to &s;ee him&mdash;&s;o I de&s;ired the girl to pre&s;ent my compliments to Madame R****, and &s;ay I would cer|tainly wait upon her in the morning.</P>
<P>We &s;tood &s;till at the corner of the Rue de Nevers whil&s;t this pa&s;s'd&mdash;We then &s;topp'd a moment whil&s;t &s;he di&s;po&s;ed of her <HI>Egarments de Coeur,</HI> &amp;c. more commodiou&s;ly than carrying them in her hand&mdash;they were two volumes; &s;o I held the &s;econd for her whil&s;t &s;he put the fir&s;t into her pocket; and then
<PB N="10" REF="12">
&s;he held her pocket, and I put in the other after it.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;weet to feel by what fine-&s;pun threads our affections are drawn to|gether.</P>
<P>We &s;et off a-fre&s;h, and as &s;he took her third &s;tep, the girl put her hand within my arm&mdash;I was ju&s;t bidding her&mdash;but &s;he did it of her&s;elf with that undeliberating &s;implicity, which &s;hew'd it was out of her head that &s;he had never &s;een me before. For my own part, I felt the conviction of con&s;anguinity &s;o &s;trongly, that I could not help turning half round to look in her face, and &s;ee if I could trace out
<PB N="11" REF="13">
any thing in it of a family likene&s;s&mdash;Tut! &s;aid I, are we not all relations?</P>
<P>When we arrived at the turning up of the Rue de Guineygaude, I &s;topp'd to bid her adieu for good an all: the girl would thank me again for my company and kindne&s;s&mdash;She bid me adieu twice&mdash;I repeated it as often; and &s;o cordial was the parting between us, that had it happen'd any where el&s;e, I'm not &s;ure but I &s;hould have &s;igned it with a ki&s;s of charity, as warm and holy as an apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>But in Paris, as none ki&s;s each other but the men&mdash;I did, what amounted to the &s;ame thing&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>THE PASSPORT.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PARIS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I got home to my hotel, La Fleur told me I had been enquired after by the Lieu|tenant de Police&mdash;The duce take it! &s;aid I&mdash;I know the rea&s;on. It is time the reader &s;hould know it, for in the order of things in which it happened, it was omitted; not that it was out of my head; but that had I told it then, it might have been forgot now&mdash;and now is the time I want it.</P>
<P>I had left London with &s;o much precipitation, that it never enter'd my
<PB N="13" REF="15">
mind that we were at war with France; and had reach'd Dover, and look'd through my gla&s;s at the hills beyond Boulogne, before the idea pre&s;ented it&s;elf; and with this in its train, that there was no getting there without a pa&s;&s;port. Go but to the end of a &s;treet, I have a mortal aver&s;ion for returning back no wi&s;er than I &s;at out; and as this was one of the great|e&s;t efforts I had ever made for know|ledge, I could le&s;s bear the thoughts of it: &s;o hearing the Count de **** had hired the packet, I begg'd he would take me in his <HI>&s;uite.</HI> The Count had &s;ome little knowledge of me, &s;o made little or no difficulty&mdash;only &s;aid, his inclination to &s;erve me could reach no further than Calais;
<PB N="14" REF="16">
as he was to return by way of Bru&s;&s;els to Paris: however, when I had once pa&s;s'd there, I might get to Paris without interruption; but that in Paris I mu&s;t make friends and &s;hift for my&s;elf.&mdash;Let me get to Paris, Mon&s;ieur le Count, &s;aid I&mdash;and I &s;hall do very well. So I embark'd, and never thought more of the matter.</P>
<P>When Le Fleur told me the Lieu|tenant de Police had been enquiring after me&mdash;the thing in&s;tantly recurred&mdash;and by the time Le Fleur had well told me, the ma&s;ter of the hotel came into my room to tell me the &s;ame thing, with this addition to it, that my pa&s;&s;port had been particu|larly
<PB N="15" REF="17">
a&s;k'd after: the ma&s;ter of the hotel concluded with &s;aying, He hoped I had one.&mdash;Not I, faith! &s;aid I.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of the hotel retired three &s;teps from me, as from an in|fected per&s;on, as I declared this&mdash;and poor Le Fleur advanced three &s;teps towards me, and with that &s;ort of movement which a good &s;oul makes to &s;uccour a di&s;tre&s;s'd one&mdash;the fellow won my heart by it; and from that &s;ingle <HI>trait,</HI> I knew his character as perfectly, and could rely upon it as firmly, as if he had &s;erved me with fidelity for &s;even years.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18">
Mon &s;eignior! cried the ma&s;ter of the hotel&mdash;but recollecting him&s;elf as he made the exclamation, he in|&s;tantly changed the tone of it&mdash;If Mon&s;ieur, &s;aid he, has not a pa&s;&s;port <HI>(apparament)</HI> in all likelihood he has friends in Paris who can procure him one.&mdash;Not that I know of, quoth I, with an air of indifference.&mdash;Then <HI>certes,</HI> replied he, you'll be &s;ent to the Ba&s;tile or the Chatelet, <HI>au moins.</HI> Poo! &s;aid I, the king of France is a good na|tured &s;oul&mdash;he'll hurt no body.&mdash;<HI>Cela n'empeche pas,</HI> &s;aid he&mdash;you will cer|tainly be &s;ent to the Ba&s;tile to-morrow morning.&mdash;But I've taken your lodg|ings for a month, an&s;wer'd I, and I'll not quit them a day before the time for all the kings of France in the

<HEAD>The Hotel at Paris.</HEAD>
<P>I COULD not find in my heart to torture La Fleur's with a &s;e|rious look upon the &s;ubject of my embarra&s;&s;ment, which was the rea|&s;on I had treated it &s;o cavalierly: and to &s;hew him how light it lay upon my mind, I dropt the &s;ubject en|tirely; and whil&s;t he waited upon me at &s;upper, talk'd to him with more than u&s;ual gaiety about Paris, and of the opera comique.&mdash;La Fleur had been there him&s;elf, and had followed me through the &s;treets as far as the book&s;eller's &s;hop; but &s;eeing me come
<PB N="19" REF="21">
out with the young <HI>fille de chambre,</HI> and that we walk'd down the Quai de Conti together, La Fleur deem'd it unnece&s;&s;ary to follow me a &s;tep fur|ther&mdash;&s;o making his own reflections upon it, he took a &s;horter cut&mdash;and got to the hotel in time to be in|form'd of the affair of the Police again&s;t my arrival.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the hone&s;t creature had taken away, and gone down to &s;up him&s;elf, I then began to think a little &s;eriou&s;ly about my &s;ituation.&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;And here, I know, Eugenius, thou wilt &s;mile at the remembrance of a &s;hort dialogue which pa&s;s'd be|twixt
<PB N="20" REF="22">
us the moment I was going to &s;et out&mdash;I mu&s;t tell it here.</P>
<P>Eugenius, knowing that I was as little &s;ubject to be overburthen'd with money as thought, had drawn me a&s;ide to interrogate me how much I had taken care for; upon telling him the exact &s;um, Eugenius &s;hook his head, and &s;aid it would not do; &s;o pull'd out his pur&s;e in order to empty it into mine.&mdash;I've enough in con|&s;cience, Eugenius, &s;aid I.&mdash;Indeed, Yorick, you have not, replied Eu|genius&mdash;I know France and Italy better than you.&mdash;But you don't con&s;ider, Eugenius, &s;aid I, refu&s;ing his offer, that before I have been three days in Paris, I &s;hall take care
<PB N="21" REF="23">
to &s;ay or do &s;omething or other for which I &s;hall get clapp'd up into the Ba&s;tile, and that I &s;hall live there a couple of months entirely at the king of France's expence.&mdash;I beg pardon, &s;aid Eugenius, drily: really, I had forgot that re&s;ource.</P>
<P>Now the event I treated gaily came &s;eriou&s;ly to my door.</P>
<P>Is it folly, or nonchalance, or phi|lo&s;ophy, or pertinacity&mdash;or what is it in me, that, after all, when La Fleur had gone down &s;tairs, and I was quite alone, that I could not bring down my mind to think of it otherwi&s;e than I had then &s;poken of it to Eugenius?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24">
&mdash;And as for the Ba&s;tile! the ter|ror is in the word&mdash;Make the mo&s;t of it you can, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, the Ba&s;tile is but another word for a tower&mdash;and a tower is but another word for a hou&s;e you can't get out of&mdash;Mercy on the gouty! for they are in it twice a year&mdash;but with nine livres a day, and pen and ink and paper and patience, albeit a man can't get out, he may do very well within&mdash;at lea&s;t for a month or &s;ix weeks; at the end of which, if he is a harmle&s;s fellow his innocence appears, and he comes out a better and wi&s;er man than he went in.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome occa&s;ion (I forget what) to &s;tep into the court-yard, as I &s;ettled
<PB N="23" REF="25">
this account; and remember I walk'd down &s;tairs in no &s;mall triumph with the conceit of my rea&s;oning&mdash;Be|&s;hrew the <HI>&s;ombre</HI> pencil! &s;aid I vaunt|ingly&mdash;for I envy not its powers, which paints the evils of life with &s;o hard and deadly a colouring. The mind &s;its terrified at the objects &s;he has magnified her&s;elf, and blackened: reduce them to their proper &s;ize and hue &s;he overlooks them&mdash;'Tis true, &s;aid I, correcting the propo&s;ition&mdash;the Ba&s;tile is not an evil to be de|&s;pi&s;ed&mdash;but &s;trip it of its towers&mdash;fill up the fo&s;s&egrave;&mdash;unbarricade the doors&mdash;call it &s;imply a confinement, and &s;up|po&s;e 'tis &s;ome tyrant of a di&s;temper&mdash;and not of a man which holds you in
<PB N="24" REF="26">
it&mdash;the evil vani&s;hes, and you bear the other half without complaint.</P>
<P>I was interrupted in the hey-day of this &s;oliloquy, with a voice which I took to be of a child, which com|plained <Q REND="inline">"it could not get out."</Q>&mdash;I look'd up and down the pa&s;&s;age, and &s;eeing neither man, woman, or child, I went out without further attention.</P>
<P>In my return back through the pa&s;&s;age, I heard the &s;ame words re|peated twice over; and looking up, I &s;aw it was a &s;tarling hung in a little cage.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I can't get out&mdash;I can't get out,"</Q> &s;aid the &s;tarling.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">
I &s;tood looking at the bird: and to every per&s;on who came through the pa&s;&s;age it ran fluttering to the &s;ide to|wards which they approach'd it, with the &s;ame lamentation of its captivity&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I can't get out",</Q> &s;aid the &s;tarling&mdash;God help thee! &s;aid I, but I'll let thee out, co&s;t what it will; &s;o I turn'd about the cage to get to the door; it was twi&s;ted and double twi&s;ted &s;o fa&s;t with wire, there was no getting it open without pulling the cage to pieces&mdash;I took both hands to it.</P>
<P>The bird flew to the place where I was attempting his deliverance, and thru&s;ting his head through the trellis, pre&s;s'd his brea&s;t again&s;t it, as if im|patient&mdash;I fear, poor creature! &s;aid I,

<P>I vow, I never had my affections more tenderly awakened; or do I re|member an incident in my life, where the di&s;&s;ipated &s;pirits, to which my rea&s;on had been a bubble, were &s;o &s;uddenly call'd home. Mechanical as the notes were, yet &s;o true in tune to nature were they chanted, that in one moment they overthrew all my &s;y&s;te|matic rea&s;onings upon the Ba&s;tile; and I heavily walk'd up &s;tairs, un|&s;aying every word I had &s;aid in go|ing down them.</P>

<HEAD>THE CAPTIVE.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PARIS.</HEAD>
<P>THE bird in his cage pur&s;ued me into my room; I &s;at down clo&s;e to my table, and leaning my head upon my hand, I begun to figure to my&s;elf the mi&s;eries of con|finement. I was in a right frame for it, and &s;o I gave full &s;cope to my imagination.</P>
<P>I was going to begin with the millions of my fellow creatures born to no inheritance but &s;lavery; but finding, however affecting the pic|ture was, that I could not bring it

near me, and that the multitude of of &s;ad groups in it did but di&s;tract me.&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;I took a &s;ingle captive, and hav|ing fir&s;t &s;hut him up in his dungeon, I then look'd through the twilight of his grated door to take his picture.</P>
<P>I beheld his body half wa&s;ted away with long expectation and confine|ment, and felt what kind of &s;ickne&s;s of the heart it was which ari&s;es from hope deferr'd. Upon looking nearer I &s;aw him pale and feveri&s;h: in thirty years the we&s;tern breeze had not once fann'd his blood&mdash;he had &s;een no &s;un, no moon in all that time&mdash;nor had the
<PB N="31" REF="33">
voice of friend or kin&s;man breathed through his lattice&mdash;his children&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;But here my heart began to bleed&mdash;and I was forced to go on with another part of the portrait.</P>
<P>He was &s;itting upon the ground upon a little &s;traw, in the furthe&s;t corner of his dungeon, which was alternately his chair and bed: a little calender of &s;mall &s;ticks were laid at the head notch'd all over with the di&s;mal days and nights he had pa&s;s'd there&mdash;he had one of the&s;e little &s;ticks in his hand, and with a ru&s;ty nail he was etching another day of mi&s;ery to add to the heap. As I darkened the little light he had, he lifted up a hopele&s;s
<PB N="32" REF="34">
eye towards the door, then ca&s;t it down&mdash;&s;hook his head, and went on with his work of affliction. I heard his chains upon his legs, as he turn'd his body to lay his little &s;tick upon the bundle&mdash;He gave a deep &s;igh&mdash;I &s;aw the iron enter into his &s;oul&mdash;I bur&s;t into tears&mdash;I could not &s;u&s;tain the picture of confinement which my fancy had drawn&mdash;I &s;tartled up from my chair, and calling La Fleur, I bid him be&s;peak me a <HI>remi&s;e,</HI> and have it ready at the door of the hotel by nine in the morning.</P>

Whil&s;t the Honourable Mr. **** was waiting for a wind at Dover it had been caught upon the cliffs be|fore it could well fly, by an Engli&s;h lad who was his groom; who not caring to de&s;troy it, had taken it in his brea&s;t into the packet&mdash;and by cour&s;e of feeding it. and taking it once under his protection, in a day or two grew fond of it, and got it &s;afe along with him to Paris.</P>
<P>At Paris the lad had laid out a a livre in a little cage for the &s;tarling, and as he had little to do better the five months his ma&s;ter &s;tay'd there, he taught it in his mother's tongue the four &s;imple words&mdash;(and no more)&mdash;

to which I own'd my&s;elf &s;o much it's debtor.</P>
<P>Upon his ma&s;ter's going on for Italy&mdash;the lad had given it to the ma&s;ter of the hotel&mdash;But his little &s;ong for liberty, being in an <HI>unknown</HI> language at Paris&mdash;the bird had little or no &s;tore &s;et by him&mdash;&s;o La Fleur bought both him and his cage for me for a bottle of Burgundy.</P>
<P>In my return from Italy I brought him with me to the country in who&s;e language he had learn'd his notes&mdash;and telling the &s;tory of him to Lord A&mdash;Lord A begg'd the bird of me&mdash;in a week Lord A gave him to Lord B&mdash;Lord B made a pre&s;ent of him to Lord C&mdash;and Lord's C's

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible but many of my readers mu&s;t have heard of him; and if any by mere chance have ever &s;een him&mdash;I beg leave to inform them, that that bird was my bird&mdash;or &s;ome vile copy &s;et up to repre&s;ent him.</P>

<P>I SHOULD not like to have my enemy take a view of my mind, when I am going to a&s;k protection of any man: for which rea&s;on I ge|nerally endeavour to protect my&s;elf; but this going to Mon&s;ieur Le Duc de C***** was an act of compul|&s;ion&mdash;had it been an act of choice, I &s;hould have done it, I &s;uppo&s;e, like other people.</P>

<P>Well! &s;aid I, I wi&s;h it well over&mdash;Coward again! as if man to man was not equal, throughout the whole &s;ur|face of the globe; and if in the field&mdash;why not face to face in the cabinet too?

<P>As I enter'd the door of the &s;aloon, I was met by a per&s;on who po&s;&s;ibly might be the maitre d'hotel, but had more the air of one of the under &s;ecretaries, who told me the Duc de C**** was bu&s;y&mdash;I am utterly ig|norant, &s;aid I, of the forms of ob|taining an audience, being an ab&s;olute &s;tranger, and what is wor&s;e in the pre|&s;ent conjuncture of affairs, being an Engli&s;hman too.&mdash;He replied, that did not increa&s;e the difficulty.&mdash;I made

<P>BEFORE I had got half-way down the &s;treet, I changed my mind: as I am at Ver&s;ailles, thought I, I might as well take a view of the town; &s;o I pull'd the cord, and or|dered the coachman to drive round &s;ome of the principal &s;treets&mdash;I &s;up|po&s;e the town is not very large, &s;aid I.&mdash;The coachmen begg'd pardon for &s;etting me right, and told me it was very &s;uperb, and that numbers of the fir&s;t dukes and marqui&s;es and counts had hotels&mdash;The Count de B****, of
<PB N="47" REF="49">
whom the book&s;eller at the Quai de Conti had &s;poke &s;o hand&s;omely the night before, came in&s;tantly into my mind.&mdash;And why &s;hould I not go, thought I, to the Count de B****, who has &s;o high an idea of Engli&s;h books, and Engli&s;hmen&mdash;and tell him my &s;tory? &s;o I changed my mind a &s;econd time&mdash;In truth it was the third; for I had intended that day for Madame de R**** in the Rue St. Pierre, and had devoutly &s;ent her word by her <HI>fille de chambre</HI> that I would a&s;&s;uredly wait upon her&mdash;but I am govern'd by circum&s;tances&mdash;I cannot govern them: &s;o &s;eeing a man &s;tanding with a ba&s;ket on the other &s;ide of the &s;treet, as if he had &s;ome|thing to &s;ell, I bid La Fleur go up
<PB N="48" REF="50">
to him and enquire for the Count's hotel.</P>
<P>La Fleur return'd a little pale; and told me it was a Chevalier de St. Louis &s;elling <HI>pat&egrave;s</HI>&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible, La Fleur! &s;aid I.&mdash;La Fleur could no more account for the phenomenon than my&s;elf; but per&s;i&s;ted in his &s;tory: he had &s;een the croix &s;et in gold, with its red ribband, he &s;aid, tied to his button-hole&mdash;and had look'd into the ba&s;ket and &s;een the <HI>pat&egrave;s</HI> which the Chevalier was &s;elling; &s;o could not be mi&s;taken in that.</P>
<P>Such a rever&s;e in man's life awakens a better principle than curio&s;ity: I could not help looking for &s;ome time
<PB N="49" REF="51">
at him as I &s;at in the <HI>remi&s;e</HI>&mdash;the more I look'd at him&mdash;his croix and his ba&s;ket, the &s;tronger they wove them&s;elves into my brain&mdash;I got out of the <HI>remi&s;e</HI> and went towards him.</P>
<P>He was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees, and with a &s;ort of a bib went half way up his brea&s;t; upon the top of this, but a little below the hem, hung his croix. His ba&s;ket of little <HI>pat&egrave;s</HI> was cover'd over with a white dama&s;k napkin; another of the &s;ame kind was &s;pread at the bottom; and there was a look of <HI>propret&eacute;</HI> and neatne&s;s throughout; that one might have bought his <HI>pat&egrave;s</HI> of him, as much from appetite as &s;entiment.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52">
He made an offer of them to nei|ther; but &s;tood &s;till with them at the corner of a hotel, for tho&s;e to buy who cho&s;e it, without &s;olicitation.</P>
<P>He was about forty-eight&mdash;of a &s;edate look, &s;omething approaching to gravity. I did not wonder.&mdash;I went up rather to the ba&s;ket than him, and having lifted up the nap|kin and taken one of his <HI>pat&egrave;s</HI> into my hand&mdash;I begg'd he would explain the appearance which affected me.</P>
<P>He told me in a few words, that the be&s;t part of his life had pa&s;s'd in the &s;ervice, in which, after &s;pending a &s;mall patrimony, he had obtain'd a company and the croix with it;
<PB N="51" REF="53">
but that at the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t peace, his regiment being reformed, and the whole corps, with tho&s;e of &s;ome other regiments, left without any provi&s;ion&mdash;he found him&s;elf in a wide world without friends, without a livre&mdash;and indeed, &s;aid he, with|out any thing but this&mdash;(pointing, as he &s;aid it, to his croix)&mdash;The poor chevalier won my pity, and he fini&s;h'd the &s;cene, with winning my e&s;teem too.</P>
<P>The king, he &s;aid, was the mo&s;t generous of princes, but his gene|ro&s;ity could neither relieve or reward every one, and it was only his mi&s;|fortune to be among&s;t the number. He had a little wife, he &s;aid, whom
<PB N="52" REF="54">
he loved, who did the <HI>pati&s;&s;erie;</HI> and added, he felt no di&s;honour in defend|ing her and him&s;elf from want in this way&mdash;unle&s;s Providence had offer'd him a better.</P>
<P>It would be wicked to with-hold a plea&s;ure from the good, in pa&s;&s;ing over what happen'd to this poor Chevalier of St. Louis about nine months after.</P>
<P>It &s;eems he u&s;ually took his &s;tand near the iron gates which lead up to the palace, and as his croix had caught the eye of numbers, num|bers had made the &s;ame enquiry which I had done&mdash;He had told them the &s;ame &s;tory, and always with
<PB N="53" REF="55">
&s;o much mode&s;ty and good &s;en&s;e, that it had reach'd at la&s;t the king's ears&mdash;who hearing the Chevalier had been a gallant officer, and re|&s;pected by the whole regiment as a man of honour and integrity&mdash;he broke up his little trade by a pen&s;ion of fifteen hundred livres a year.</P>
<P>As I have told this to plea&s;e the reader, I beg he will allow me to relate another out of its order, to plea&s;e my&s;elf&mdash;the two &s;tories reflect light upon each other,&mdash;and 'tis a pity they &s;hould be parted.</P>

the Marquis, attended with his two boys, enter'd the court; and having pleaded the right of an ancient law of the duchy, which, though &s;eldom claim'd, he &s;aid, was no le&s;s in force; he took his &s;word from his &s;ide&mdash;Here&mdash;&s;aid he&mdash;take it; and be tru&s;ty guardians of it, till better times put me in condition to reclaim it.</P>

<P>A SHOE coming loo&s;e from the fore-foot of the thill-hor&s;e, at the beginning of the a&s;cent of mount Taurira, the po&s;tilion di&s;mounted, twi&s;ted the &s;hoe off, and put it in his pocket; as the a&s;cent was of five or &s;ix miles, and that hor&s;e our main dependence, I made a point of having the &s;hoe fa&s;ten'd on again, as well as we could; but the po&s;tilion had thrown away the nails, and the ham|mer in the chai&s;e-box, being of no great u&s;e without them, I &s;ubmitted to go on.</P>

He had not mounted half a mile higher, when coming to a flinty piece of road, the poor devil lo&s;t a &s;econd &s;hoe, and from off his other fore-foot; I then got out of the chai&s;e in good earne&s;t; and &s;eeing a hou&s;e about a quarter of a mile to the left-hand, with a great deal to do, I prevailed upon the po&s;tilion to turn up to it. The look of the hou&s;e, and of every thing about it, as we drew nearer, &s;oon reconciled me to the di&s;a&s;ter.&mdash;It was a little farm-hou&s;e &s;urrounded with about twenty acres of vineyard, about as much corn&mdash;and clo&s;e to the hou&s;e, on one &s;ide, was a <HI>potagerie</HI> of an acre and a half, full of every thing

which could make plenty in a French pea&s;ant's hou&s;e&mdash;and on the other &s;ide was a little wood which furni&s;hed wherewithal to dre&s;s it.

&s;tones from their &s;ummits, and block his up road.&mdash;The pea&s;ants had been all day at work in removing a fragment of this kind between St. Michael and Madane; and by the time my Voi|turin got to the place, it wanted full two hours of compleating be|fore a pa&s;&s;age could any how be gain'd: there was nothing but to wait with patience&mdash;'twas a wet and tem|pe&s;tuous night; &s;o that by the de|lay, and that together, the Voiturin found him&s;elf obliged to take up five miles &s;hort of his &s;tage at a little decent kind of an inn by the road &s;ide.</P>
<P>I forthwith took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my bed-chamber&mdash;got a good fire&mdash;or|der'd
<PB N="196" REF="204">
&s;upper; and was thanking heaven it was no wor&s;e&mdash;when a voiture arrived with a lady in it and her &s;ervant-maid.</P>
<P>As there was no other bed-cham|ber in the hou&s;e, the ho&s;te&s;s, without much nicety, led them into mine, telling them, as &s;he u&s;her'd them in, that there was no body in it but an Engli&s;h gentleman&mdash;that there were two good beds, in it and a clo&s;et with|in the room which held another&mdash;the accent in which &s;he &s;poke of this third bed did not &s;ay much for it&mdash;however, &s;he &s;aid, there were three beds, and but three people&mdash;and &s;he dur&s;t &s;ay, the gentleman would do
<PB N="197" REF="205">
any thing to accommodate matters.&mdash;I left not the lady a moment to make a conjecture about it&mdash;&s;o in&s;tantly made a declaration I would do any thing in my power.</P>
<P>As this did not amount to an ab|&s;olute &s;urrender of my bed-chamber, I &s;till felt my&s;elf &s;o much the pro|prietor, as to have a right to do the honours of it&mdash;&s;o I de&s;ired the lady to &s;it down&mdash;pre&s;&s;ed her into the warme&s;t &s;eat&mdash;call'd for more wood&mdash;de&s;ired the ho&s;te&s;s to enlarge the plan of the &s;upper, and to favour us with the very be&s;t wine.</P>
<P>The lady had &s;carce warm'd her|&s;elf five minutes at the fire, before
<PB N="198" REF="206">
&s;he began to turn her head back, and give alook at the beds; and the oftener &s;he ca&s;t her eyes that way, the more they return'd perplex'd&mdash;I felt for her&mdash;and for my&s;elf; for in a few minutes, what by her looks, and the ca&s;e it&s;elf, I found my|&s;elf as much embarra&s;&s;ed as it was po&s;&s;ible the lady could be her&s;elf.</P>
<P>That the beds we were to lay in were in one and the &s;ame room, was enough &s;imply by it&s;elf to have ex|cited all this&mdash;but the po&s;ition of them, for they &s;tood parallel, and &s;o very clo&s;e to each other as only to allow &s;pace for a &s;mall wicker chair betwixt them, render'd the affair
<PB N="199" REF="207">
&s;till more oppre&s;&s;ive to us&mdash;they were fixed up moreover near the fire, and the projection of the chimney on one &s;ide, and a large beam which cro&s;s'd the room on the other, form'd a kind of rece&s;s for them that was no way favourable to the nicety of our &s;en|&s;ations&mdash;if any thing could have added to it, it was, that the two beds were both of 'em &s;o very &s;mall, as to cut us off from every idea of the lady and the maid lying together; which in either of them, could it have been fea&s;ible, my lying be&s;ides them, tho' a thing not to be wi&s;h'd, yet there was nothing in it &s;o terrible which the imagination might not have pa&s;s'd over without torment.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="208">
As for the little room within, it offer'd little or no con&s;olation to us; 'twas a damp cold clo&s;et, with a half di&s;mantled window &s;hutter, and with a window which had neither gla&s;s or oil paper in it to keep out the tem|pe&s;t of the night. I did not endea|vour to &s;tifle my cough when the lady gave a peep into it; &s;o it reduced the ca&s;e in cour&s;e to this alternative&mdash;that the lady &s;hould &s;acrifice her health to her feelings, and take up with the clo&s;et her&s;elf, and abandon the bed next mine to her maid&mdash;or that the girl &s;hould take the clo&s;et, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The lady was a Piedmonte&s;e of about thirty, with a glow of health

religion and good faith on both &s;ides, as in any treaty which as yet had the honour of being handed down to po|&s;terity.</P>

<P>Granted, on the part of Madame; with a provi&s;o, That as the curtains of that bed are of a flim&s;y tran&s;|parent cotton, and appear likewi&s;e too &s;canty to draw clo&s;e, that the

Fille de Chambre, &s;hall fa&s;ten up the opening, either by corking pins, or needle and thread, in &s;uch manner as &s;hall be deemed a &s;ufficient barrier on the &s;ide of Mon&s;ieur.</P>
<P>2dly. It is required on the part of Madame, that Mon&s;ieur &s;hall lay the whole night through in his robe de chambre.</P>
<P>Rejected: ina&s;much Mon&s;ieur is not worth a robe de chambre; he having nothing in his portmanteau but &s;ix &s;hirts and a black &s;ilk pair of breeches.</P>
<P>The mentioning the &s;ilk pair of breeches made an entire change of the article&mdash;for the breeches were ac|cepted
<PB N="205" REF="215">
as an equivalent for the robe de chambre, and &s;o it was &s;tipulated and agreed upon that I &s;hould lay in my black &s;ilk breeches all night.</P>
<P>3dly. It was in&s;i&s;ted upon, and &s;ti|pulated for by the lady, that after Mon&s;ieur was got to bed, and the candle and fire extingui&s;hed, that Mon&s;ieur &s;hould not &s;peak one &s;ingle word the whole night.</P>
<P>Granted; provided Mon&s;ieur's &s;ay|ing his prayers might not be deem'd an infraction of the treaty.</P>
<P>There was but one point forgot in this treaty, and that was the manner in which the lady and my&s;elf &s;hould
<PB N="206" REF="216">
be obliged to undre&s;s and get to bed&mdash;there was but one way of doing it, and that I leave to the reader to de|vi&s;e; prote&s;ting as I do it, that if it is not the mo&s;t delicate in nature, 'tis the fault of his own imagination&mdash;again&s;t which this is not my fir&s;t complaint.</P>
<P>Now when we were got to bed, whether it was the novelty of the &s;ituation, or what it was, I know not; but &s;o it was, I could not &s;hut my eyes; I tried this &s;ide and that, and turn'd and turn'd again, till a full hour after midnight; when Nature and patience both wearing out&mdash;O my God! &s;aid I&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;You have broke the treaty, Mon&s;ieur, &s;aid the lady, who had no

<P>The lady would by no means give up her point, tho' &s;he weakened her barrier by it; for in the warmth of the di&s;pute, I could hear two or three corking pins fall out of the curtain to the ground.</P>
