<P>THE unfortunate Licinius was the la&s;t rival who oppo&s;ed the greatne&s;s, and the la&s;t captive who adorned the triumph, of Con&s;tantine. After a tranquil and pro&s;perous reign, the Conqueror bequeathed to his family the inheritance of the Roman Empire; a new capital, a new policy, and a new religion; and the innovations which he e&s;tabli&s;hed have been embraced and con&s;ecrated by &s;ucceeding genera|tions. The age of the great Con&s;tantine and his &s;ons is filled with important events; but the hi&s;to|rian mu&s;t be oppre&s;&s;ed by their number and va|riety,
<PB N="2" REF="9">
unle&s;s he diligently &s;eparates from each other the &s;cenes which are connected only by the order of time. He will de&s;cribe the political in|&s;titutions that gave &s;trength and &s;tability to the empire, before he proceeds to relate the wars and revolutions which ha&s;tened its decline. He will adopt the divi&s;ion unknown to the ancients, of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs: the victory of the Chri&s;tians, and their inte&s;tine di&s;cord, will &s;up|ply copious and di&s;tinct materials both for edifi|cation and for &s;candal.</P>
<P>After the defeat and abdication of Licinius, <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;ign of a new ca|pital.</NOTE> his victorious rival proceeded to lay the founda|tions of a city, de&s;tined to reign, in future times, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 324.</NOTE> the mi&s;tre&s;s of the Ea&s;t, and to &s;urvive the empire and religion of Con&s;tantine. The motives, whe|ther of pride or of policy, which fir&s;t induced Diocletian to withdraw him&s;elf from the ancient &s;eat of government, had acquired additional weight by the example of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and the habits of forty years. Rome was in&s;en&s;ibly con|founded with the dependent kingdoms which had once acknowledged her &s;upremacy; and the country of the Cae&s;ars was viewed with cold in|difference by a martial prince, born in the neigh|bourhood of the Danube, educated in the courts and armies of A&s;ia, and inve&s;ted with the purple by the legions of Britain. The Italians, who had received Con&s;tantine as their deliverer, &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ively obeyed the edicts which he &s;ometimes con|de&s;cended to addre&s;s to the &s;enate and people of Rome; but they were &s;eldom honoured with the pre&s;ence of their new &s;overeign. During the vi|gour
<PB N="3" REF="10">
of his age, Con&s;tantine, according to the va|rious exigencies of peace and war, moved with &s;low dignity, or with active diligence, along the frontiers of his exten&s;ive dominions; and was al|ways prepared to take the field either again&s;t a foreign or a dome&s;tic enemy. But as he gradu|ally reached the &s;ummit of pro&s;perity and the de|cline of life, he began to meditate the de&s;ign of fixing in a more permanent &s;tation the &s;trength as well as maje&s;ty of the throne. In the choice of an advantageous &s;ituation, he preferred the con|fines of Europe and A&s;ia; to curb, with a power|ful arm, the barbarians who dwelt between the Danube and the Tanais; to watch with an eye of jealou&s;y the conduct of the Per&s;ian monarch, who indignantly &s;upported the yoke of an ignominious treaty. With the&s;e views, Diocletian had &s;elected and embelli&s;hed the re&s;idence of Nicomedia: but the memory of Diocletian was ju&s;tly abhorred by the protector of the church; and Con&s;tantine was not in&s;en&s;ible to the ambition of founding a city which might perpetuate the glory of his own name. During the late operations of the war again&s;t Licinius, he had &s;ufficient opportunity to contemplate, both as a &s;oldier and as a &s;tate&s;man, the incomparable po&s;ition of Byzantium; and to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation of Byzan|tium.</NOTE> ob&s;erve how &s;trongly it was guarded by nature again&s;t an ho&s;tile attack, whil&s;t it was acce&s;|&s;ible on every &s;ide to the benefits of commercial intercour&s;e. Many ages before Con&s;tantine, one of the mo&s;t judicious hi&s;torians of antiqui|ty <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Polybius, l. iv. p. 423. edit. Ca&s;aubon. He ob&s;erves that the peace of the Byzantines was frequently di&s;turbed, and the extent of their territory contracted, by the inroads of the wild Thracians.</NOTE>

had de&s;cribed the advantages of a &s;ituation, from whence a feeble colony of Greeks derived the command of the &s;ea, and the honours of a flouri&s;hing and independent republic <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The navigator Byzas, who was &s;tyled the &s;on of Neptune, founded the city 656 years before the Chri&s;tian Aera. His followers were drawn from Argos and Megara. Byzantium was afterwards rebuilt and fortified by the Spartan general Pau&s;anias. See Scaliger Animadver&s;. ad Eu&s;eb. p. 81. Ducange Con&s;tantinopolis, l. i. part i. cap. 15, 16. With regard to the wars of the Byzantines again&s;t Philip, the Gauls, and the kings of Bithynia, we &s;hould tru&s;t none but the ancient writers who lived before the greatne&s;s of the imperial city had excited a &s;pirit of flattery and fiction.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If we &s;urvey Byzantium in the extent which it <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;crip|tion of CON|STANTI|NOPLE.</NOTE> acquired with the augu&s;t name of Con&s;tantinople, the figure of the imperial city may be repre&s;ented under that of an unequal triangle. The obtu&s;e point, which advances towards the ea&s;t and the &s;hores of A&s;ia, meets and repels the waves of the Thracian Bo&s;phorus. The northern &s;ide of the city is bounded by the harbour; and the &s;outhern is wa&s;hed by the Propontis, or &s;ea of Marmara. The ba&s;is of the triangle is oppo&s;ed to the we&s;t, and terminates the continent of Europe. But the admirable form and divi&s;ion of the circumjacent land and water cannot, without a more ample ex|planation, be clearly or &s;ufficiently under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The winding channel through which the waters <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bol|phorus.</NOTE> of the Euxine flow with a rapid and ince&s;&s;ant cour&s;e towards the Mediterranean, received the appellation of Bo&s;phorus, a name not le&s;s cele|brated

<P N="2">II. The fortunes of the Praetorian praefects <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prae|torian prae|fects.</NOTE> were e&s;&s;entially different from the&s;e of the con&s;uls and patricians. The latter &s;aw their ancient great|ne&s;s evaporate in a vain title. The former, ri&s;ing by degrees from the mo&s;t humble condition, were inve&s;ted with the civil and military admini&s;tra|tion of the Roman world. From the reign of Severus to that of Diocletian, the guards and the palace, the laws and the finances, the armies and the provinces, were intru&s;ted to their &s;uperintend|ing care; and, like the Vizirs of the Ea&s;t, they held with one hand the &s;eal, and with the other the &s;tandard, of the empire. The ambition of the praefects, always formidable, and &s;ome|times fatal to the ma&s;ters whom they &s;erved, was &s;upported by the &s;trength of the Praetorian bands; but after tho&s;e haughty troops had been weakened by Diocletian, and finally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by Con&s;tantine, the praefects, who &s;urvived their fall, were reduced without difficulty to the &s;ta|tion of u&s;eful and obedient mini&s;ters. When they were no longer re&s;pon&s;ible for the &s;afety of the emperor's per&s;on, they re&s;igned the juri&s;diction which they had hitherto claimed and exerci&s;ed over all the departments of the palace. They were deprived by Con&s;tantine of all military com|mand, as &s;oon as they had cea&s;ed to lead into the
<PB N="43" REF="50">
field, under their immediate orders, the flower of the Roman troops; and at length, by a &s;ingular revolution, the captains of the guards were trans|formed into the civil magi&s;trates of the provinces. According to the plan of government in&s;tituted by Diocletian, the four princes had each their Praetorian praefect; and, after the monarchy was once more united in the per&s;on of Con&s;tantine, he &s;till continued to create the &s;ame number of FOUR PRAEFECTS, and entru&s;ted to their care the &s;ame provinces which they already admini&s;tered. 1. The praefect of the Ea&s;t &s;tretched his ample juri&s;|diction into the three parts of the globe which were &s;ubject to the Romans, from the cataracts of the Nile to the banks of the Pha&s;is, and from the mountains of Thrace to the frontiers of Per|&s;ia. 2. The important provinces of Pannonia, Dacia, Macedonia, and Greece, once acknow|ledged the authority of the praefect of Illyricum. 3. The power of the praefect of Italy was not con|fined to the country from whence he derived his title; it extended over the additional territory of Rhaetia as far as the banks of the Danube, over the dependent i&s;lands of the Mediterranean, and over that part of the continent of Africa which lies between the confines of Cyrene and tho&s;e of Tingitania. 4. The praefect of the Gauls com|prehended under that plural denomination the kindred provinces of Britain and Spain, and his authority was obeyed from the wall of Antoninus to the fort of Mount Atlas <NOTE N="99" PLACE="foot">Zo&s;imus, l. ii. p. 109, 110.

After the Praetorian praefects had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from all military command, the civil functions which they were ordained to exerci&s;e over &s;o many &s;ubject nations, were adequate to the am|bition and abilities of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate mi|ni&s;ters. To their wi&s;dom was committed the &s;u|preme admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice and of the finances, the two objects which, in a &s;tate of peace, com|prehend almo&s;t all the re&s;pective duties of the &s;overeign and of the people; of the former, to protect the citizens who are obedient to the laws; of the latter, to contribute the &s;hare of their property which is required for the expences of the &s;tate. The coin, the highways, the po&s;ts, the granaries, the manufactures, whatever could intere&s;t the public pro&s;perity, was moderated by the authority of the Praetorian praefects.

About the &s;ame time that Con&s;tantine gave a legal &s;anction to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical order, he in&s;tituted in the Roman empire the nice balance of the civil and the military powers. The emulation, and &s;ometimes the di&s;cord, which reigned between two profe&s;&s;ions of oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts and incom|patible manners, was productive of beneficial and of pernicious con&s;equences. It was &s;eldom to be expected that the general and the civil governor of a province &s;hould either con&s;pire for the di&s;|turbance, or &s;hould unite for the &s;ervice, of their country. While the one delayed to offer the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance which the other di&s;dained to &s;olicit, the troops very frequently remained without orders or without &s;upplies; the public &s;afety was be|trayed, and the defencele&s;s &s;ubjects were left ex|po&s;ed to the fury of the Barbarians.

The rivals who contended for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Roman world, had withdrawn the greate&s;t part of their forces from the guard of the general frontier; and the principal cities which formed the boun|dary of their re&s;pective dominions were filled with &s;oldiers, who con&s;idered their countrymen as their mo&s;t implacable enemies.

That the ancient and modern Roman pound, containing 5256 grains of Troy weight, is about one twelfth lighter than the Engli&s;h pound, which is compo&s;ed of 5760 of the &s;ame grains. 2. That the pound of gold, which had once been divided into forty|eight <HI>aurei,</HI> was at this time coined into &s;eventy-two &s;maller pieces of the &s;ame denomination. 3. That five of the&s;e aurei were the legal tender for a pound of &s;ilver, and that con&s;equently the pound of gold was exchanged for fourteen pounds eight ounces of &s;ilver, ac|cording to the Roman, or about thirteen pounds according to the Engli&s;h, weight. 4. That the Engli&s;h pound of &s;ilver is coined into &s;ixty-two &s;hillings. From the&s;e elements we may compute the Roman pound of gold, the u&s;ual method of reckoning large &s;ums, at forty pounds &s;terling; and we may fix the currency of the <HI>aureus</HI> at &s;omewhat more than eleven &s;hillings.</NOTE>.

<P N="1">1. It is obvious, that, as long as the immutable con&s;titution of human nature produces and main|tains &s;o unequal a divi&s;ion of property, the mo&s;t numerous part of the community would be de|prived of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, by the equal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment of a tax from which the &s;overeign would derive a very trifling revenue.

In a poetical reque&s;t, addre&s;&s;ed to one of the la&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;erving of the Roman Princes who reign|ed in Gaul, Sidonius Apollinaris per&s;onifies his tribute under the figure of a triple mon&s;ter, the Geryon of the Grecian fables, and intreats the new Hercules that he would mo&s;t graciou&s;ly be plea&s;ed to &s;ave his life by cutting off three of his heads <NOTE N="181" PLACE="foot"><L>Geryones nos e&s;&s;e puta, mon&s;trumque tributum,</L>

<P>The reputation of Father Sirmond led me to expect more &s;atisfaction than I have found in his note (p. 144.) on this remarkable pa&s;&s;age. The words, &s;uo vel <HI>&s;uorum</HI> nomine, betray the perplexity of the com|mentator.</P></NOTE>. The fortune of Sidonius far exceeded the cu&s;tomary wealth of a poet; but if he had pur&s;ued the allu&s;ion, he mu&s;t have painted many of the Gallic nobles with the hundred heads of the deadly Hydra, &s;preading over the face of the country, and devouring the &s;ub&s;tance of an hun|dred families. II. The difficulty of allowing an annual &s;um of about nine pounds &s;terling, even for the average of the capitation of Gaul, may be rendered more evident by the compari&s;on of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the &s;ame country, as it is now go|verned by the ab&s;olute monarch of an indu&s;trious, wealthy and affectionate people. The taxes of France cannot be magnified, either by fear or by

flattery, beyond the annual amount of eighteen millions &s;terling, which ought perhaps to be &s;hared among four-and-twenty millions of inha|bitants <NOTE N="182" PLACE="foot">This a&s;&s;ertion, however formidable it may &s;eem, is founded on the original regi&s;ters of births, deaths, and marriages, collected by public authority, and now depo&s;ited in the <HI>Contr&ocirc;le General</HI> at Paris. The annual average of births throughout the whole kingdom, taken in five years (from 1770 to 1774, both inclu&s;ive) is, 479, 649 boys, and 449, 269 girls, in all 928, 918 children. The province of French Hainault alone furni&s;hes 9906 births: and we are a&s;&s;ured, by an actual numeration of the people annually repeated from the year 1773 to the year 1776, that, upon an average, Hainault con|tains 257,097 inhabitants. By the rules of fair analogy, we might infer, that the ordinary proportion of annual births to the whole people, is about 1 to 26; and that the kingdom of France contains 24, 151, 868 per&s;ons of both &s;exes and of every age. If we content our&s;elves with the more moderate proportion of 1 to 25, the whole population will amount to 23, 222, 950. From the diligent re&s;earches of the French government (which are not unworthy of our own imi|tation), we may hope to obtain a &s;till greater degree of certainty on this important &s;ubject.</NOTE>. Seven millions of the&s;e, in the ca|pacity of fathers, or brothers, or hu&s;bands, may di&s;charge the obligations of the remaining multi|tude of women and children; yet the equal pro|portion of each tributary &s;ubject will &s;carcely ri&s;e above fifty &s;hillings of our money, in&s;tead of a proportion almo&s;t four times as con&s;iderable, which was regularly impo&s;ed on their Gallic an|ce&s;tors. The rea&s;on of this difference may be found, not &s;o much in the relative &s;carcity or plenty of gold and &s;ilver, as in the different &s;tate of &s;ociety in ancient Gaul and in modern France. In a country where per&s;onal freedom is the pri|vilege of every &s;ubject, the whole ma&s;s of taxes, whether they are levied on property or on con|&s;umption, may be fairly divided among the whole

The truth of this a&s;&s;ertion may be illu&s;trated by the following example: The Aedui, one of the mo&s;t powerful and civilized tribes or <HI>cities</HI> of Gaul, occupied an extent of ter|ritory, which now contains above five hundred thou&s;and inhabitants, in the two eccle&s;ia&s;tical dioce&s;es of Autun and Nevers <NOTE N="184" PLACE="foot">The ancient juri&s;diction of <HI>(Augu&s;todunum)</HI> Autun in Bur|gundy, the capital of the Aedui, comprehended the adjacent ter|ritory of <HI>(Noviodunum)</HI> Nevers.

Some indulgence was granted to the profe&s;&s;ion of the liberal arts: but every other branch of commercial indu&s;try was affected by the &s;everity of the law.

<P>The per&s;on, as well as the mind of Con&s;tan|tine, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His vir|tues.</NOTE> had been enriched by nature with her choice&s;t endowments.

He delighted in the &s;ocial intercour&s;e of familiar conver&s;ation; and though he might &s;ometimes indulge his di&s;po&s;ition to raillery with le&s;s re&s;erve than was required by the &s;evere dignity of his &s;tation, the courte&s;y and liberality of his manners gained the hearts of all who approached him.

of the value of learning; and the arts and &s;ciences derived &s;ome encouragement from the munificent protection of Con&s;tantine. In the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s, his diligence was indefatigable; and the active powers of his mind were almo&s;t continually exerci&s;ed in reading, writing, or meditating, in giving audience to amba&s;&s;adors, and in examin|ing the complaints of his &s;ubjects. Even tho&s;e who cen&s;ured the propriety of his mea&s;ures were compelled to acknowledge, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed mag|nanimity to conceive, and patience to execute, the mo&s;t arduous de&s;igns, without being checked either by the prejudices of education, or by the clamours of the multitude. In the field, he in|fu&s;ed his own intrepid &s;pirit into the troops, whom he conducted with the talents of a con|&s;ummate general; and to his abilities, rather than to his fortune, we may a&s;cribe the &s;ignal victories which he obtained over the foreign and dome&s;tic foes of the republic.

were animated again&s;t the Goths, by the memory of the wars which, in the preceding cen|tury, they had maintained with unequal forces again&s;t the invaders of their country. They were connected with the Romans by the mutual bene|fits of commerce; as they were &s;upplied from the provinces of A&s;ia with corn and manufactures, which they purcha&s;ed with their only productions, &s;alt, wax, and hides. Obedient to the requi&s;ition of Con&s;tantine, they prepared, under the conduct of their magi&s;trate Diogenes, a con&s;iderable army, of which the principal &s;trength con&s;i&s;ted in cro&s;s|bows and military chariots. The &s;peedy march and intrepid attack of the Cher&s;onites, by divert|ing the attention of the Goths, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the opera|tions of the Imperial generals. The Goths, van|qui&s;hed on every &s;ide, were driven into the moun|tains, where, in the cour&s;e of a &s;evere campaign, above an hundred thou&s;and were computed to have peri&s;hed by cold and hunger. Peace was at length granted to their humble &s;upplications; the elde&s;t &s;on of Araric was accepted as the mo&s;t va|luable ho&s;tage; and Con&s;tantine endeavoured to convince their chiefs, by a liberal di&s;tribution of honours and rewards, how far the friend&s;hip of the Romans was preferable to their enmity. In the expre&s;&s;ions of his gratitude towards the faith|ful Cher&s;onites, the emperor was &s;till more mag|nificent.

But it was thought that the Sarmatians were &s;ufficiently re|warded by their deliverance from impending ruin; and the emperor, perhaps with too &s;trict an oeco|nomy, deducted &s;ome part of the expences of the war from the cu&s;tomary gratifications which were allowed to that turbulent nation.</P>
<P>Exa&s;perated by this apparent neglect, the Sar|matians <NOTE PLACE="marg">Expul&s;ion of the Sar|matians,</NOTE> &s;oon forgot, with the levity of Barbarians, the &s;ervices which they had &s;o lately received, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

Their inroads on the territory of the empire pro|voked the indignation of Con&s;tantine to leave them to their fate; and he no longer oppo&s;ed the ambition of Geberic, a renowned warrior, who had recently a&s;cended the Gothic throne.

To &s;ecure this inglorious ea&s;e, he &s;ubmitted to the conditions of peace which Sapor conde&s;cended to impo&s;e; the payment of an annual tribute, and the re&s;titution of the fertile province of Atropatene, which the

the day was mo&s;t commonly adver&s;e to the Ro|mans, but in the battle of Singara, their impru|dent valour had almo&s;t atchieved a &s;ignal and de|ci&s;ive victory. The &s;tationary troops of Singara retired on the approach of Sapor, who pa&s;&s;ed the Tigris over three bridges, and occupied near the village of Hilleh an advantageous camp, which, by the labour of his numerous pioneers, he &s;ur|rounded in one day with a deep ditch, and a lofty rampart. His formidable ho&s;t, when it was drawn out in order of battle, covered the banks of the river, the adjacent heights, and the whole extent of a plain of above twelve miles, which &s;eparated the two armies. Both were alike impatient to engage; but the Barbarians, after a &s;light re&s;i&s;t|ance, fled in di&s;order; unable to re&s;i&s;t, or de|&s;irous to weary, the &s;trength of the heavy legions, who, fainting with heat and thir&s;t, pur&s;ued them acro&s;s the plain, and cut in pieces a line of ca|valry, clothed in complete armour, which had been po&s;ted before the gates of the camp to pro|tect their retreat. Con&s;tantius, who was hurried along in the pur&s;uit, attempted, without effect, to re&s;train the ardour of his troops, by repre&s;ent|ing to them the dangers of the approaching night,

and the certainty of completing their &s;ucce&s;s with the return of day. As they depended much more on their own valour, than on the experience or the abilities of their chief, they &s;ilenced by their cla|mours his timid remon&s;trances; and ru&s;hing with fury to the charge, filled up the ditch, broke down the rampart, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves through the tents, to recruit their exhau&s;ted &s;trength, and to enjoy the rich harve&s;t of their labours. But the prudent Sapor had watched the moment of victory. His army, of which the greater part, &s;ecurely po&s;ted on the heights, had been &s;pectators of the action, advanced in &s;ilence, and under the &s;hadow of the night; and his Per|&s;ian archers, guided by the illumination of the camp, poured a &s;hower of arrows on a di&s;armed and licentious crowd.

The irre&s;i&s;tible force of the waters was alternately fatal to the contending parties, till at length a portion of the walls, unable to &s;u&s;tain the accumulated pre&s;&s;ure, gave way at once, and expo&s;ed an ample breach of one hundred and fifty feet. The Per|&s;ians were in&s;tantly driven to the a&s;&s;ault, and the fate of Ni&s;ibis depended on the event of the day. The heavy-armed cavalry, who led the van of a deep column, were embarra&s;&s;ed in the mud, and great numbers were drowned in the un&s;een holes which had been filled by the ru&s;hing waters.

The fir&s;t part of his oration &s;eemed to be pointed only again&s;t the tyrant of Gaul; but while he tragically lamented the cruel murder of Con&s;tans, he in&s;inuated, that none, except a brother, could claim a right to the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion

He carried by a&s;|&s;ault the important town of Si&s;cia; made an at|tack on the city of Sirmium, which lay in the rear of the Imperial camp; attempted to force a pa&s;&s;age over the Save into the ea&s;tern provinces of

The&s;e offers were enforced by the eloquence of Philip, the Im|perial amba&s;&s;ador; and the council as well as the army of Magnentius were di&s;po&s;ed to accept them. But the haughty u&s;urper, carele&s;s of the remon&s;trances of his friends, gave orders that Philip &s;hould be detained as a captive, or at lea&s;t as a ho&s;tage; while he di&s;patched an officer to re|proach Con&s;tantius with the weakne&s;s of his reign, and to in&s;ult him by the promi&s;e of a pardon, if he would in&s;tantly abdicate the purple. <Q>That he &s;hould confide in the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, and the protection of an avenging Deity,</Q> was the only an&s;wer which honour permitted the em|peror to return.

<PB N="176" REF="183">
purple, or at lea&s;t to remove him from the indo|lent luxury of A&s;ia to the hard&s;hips and dangers of a German war. The death of Theophilus, con&s;ular of the province of Syria, who in a time of &s;carcity had been ma&s;&s;acred by the people of Antioch, with the connivance, and almo&s;t at the in&s;tigation, of Gallus, was ju&s;tly re&s;ented, not only as an act of wanton cruelty, but as a dan|gerous in&s;ult on the &s;upreme maje&s;ty of Con&s;tan|tius. Two mini&s;ters of illu&s;trious rank, Domi|tian, the Oriental praefect, and Montius, quae&s;tor of the palace, were empowered by a &s;pecial com|mi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it and reform the &s;tate of the Ea&s;t. They were in&s;tructed to behave towards Gallus with moderation and re&s;pect, and, by the gentle&s;t arts of per&s;ua&s;ion, to engage him to comply with the invitation of his brother and colleague. The ra&s;hne&s;s of the praefect di&s;appointed the&s;e prudent mea&s;ures, and ha&s;tened his own ruin, as well as that of his enemy. On his arrival at Antioch, Domitian pa&s;&s;ed di&s;dainfully before the gates of the palace, and alleging a &s;light pretence of in|di&s;po&s;ition, continued &s;everal days in &s;ullen re|tirement, to prepare an inflammatory memorial, which he tran&s;mitted to the Imperial court. Yielding at length to the pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations of Gallus, the praefect conde&s;cended to take his &s;eat in council; but his fir&s;t &s;tep was to &s;ignify a con|ci&s;e and haughty mandate, importing that the Cae&s;ar &s;hould immediately repair to Italy, and threatening that he him&s;elf would puni&s;h his de|lay or he&s;itation, by &s;u&s;pending the u&s;ual allow|ance of his hou&s;ehold. The nephew and daughter
<PB N="177" REF="184">
of Con&s;tantine, who could ill brook the in&s;olence of a &s;ubject, expre&s;&s;ed their re&s;entment by in|&s;tantly delivering Domitian to the cu&s;tody of a guard. The quarrel &s;till admitted of &s;ome terms of accommodation. They were rendered im|practicable by the imprudent behaviour of Mon|tius, a &s;tate&s;man, who&s;e art and experience were frequently betrayed by the levity of his di&s;po&s;i|tion <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">In the pre&s;ent text of Ammianus, we read, <HI>A&s;per,</HI> quidem, &s;ed ad <HI>lenitatem</HI> propen&s;ior; which forms a &s;entence of contradictory non|&s;en&s;e.

In&s;tead of a&s;&s;uming the title of Augu&s;tus, in&s;tead of employing in his defence the troops and trea&s;ures of the Ea&s;t, he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be deceived by the affected tranquillity of Con|&s;tantius, who, leaving him the vain pageantry of a court, imperceptibly recalled the veteran le|gions from the provinces of A&s;ia.

After Gallus had been permitted to repo&s;e him|&s;elf a few days at Hadrianople, he received a mandate, expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t haughty and ab|&s;olute &s;tyle, that his &s;plendid retinue &s;hould halt in that city, while the Cae&s;ar him&s;elf, with only ten po&s;t-carriages, &s;hould ha&s;ten to the Imperial re&s;idence at Milan. In this rapid journey, the profound re&s;pect which was due to the brother and colleague of Con&s;tantius, was in&s;en&s;ibly changed into rude familiarity; and Gallus, who di&s;covered in the countenances of the attendants that they already con&s;idered them&s;elves as his guards, and might &s;oon be employed as his exe|cutioners, began to accu&s;e his fatal ra&s;hne&s;s, and to recollect with terror and remor&s;e the conduct by which he had provoked his fate. The di&s;&s;i|mulation which had hitherto been pre&s;erved, was laid a&s;ide at Petovio in Pannonia. He was con|ducted to a palace in the &s;uburbs, where the ge|neral Barbatio, with a &s;elect band of &s;oldiers, who could neither be moved by pity, nor corrupted by rewards, expected the arrival of his illu&s;trious victim.

He was received by the magi&s;trates and &s;enate of Rome; and the emperor &s;urveyed, with attention, the civil honours of the republic, and the con&s;ular images of the noble families. The &s;treets were lined

with an innumerable multitude. Their repeated acclamations expre&s;&s;ed their joy at beholding, after an ab&s;ence of thirty-two years, the &s;acred per&s;on of their &s;overeign; and Con&s;tantius him|&s;elf expre&s;&s;ed, with &s;ome plea&s;antry, his affected &s;urpri&s;e that the human race &s;hould thus &s;uddenly be collected on the &s;ame &s;pot.

His &s;hort vi&s;it of thirty days was employed in viewing the monuments of art and power, which were &s;cattered over the &s;even hills and the interjacent vallies. He admired the awful maje&s;ty of the capitol, the va&s;t extent of the baths of Caracalla and Diocletian, the &s;evere &s;implicity of the Pantheon, the ma&s;&s;y greatne&s;s of the amphitheatre of Titus, the elegant archi|tecture of the theatre of Pompey and the Temple of Peace, and, above all, the &s;tately &s;tructure of the Forum and column of Trajan; acknowledg|ing, that the voice of fame, &s;o prone to invent and to magnify, had made an inadequate report of the metropolis of the world.

The garri&s;ons of the frontier were in&s;ufficient to check their progre&s;s; and the indolent monarch was at length compelled to a&s;&s;emble, from the extremities of his dominions, the flower of the Palatine troops, to take the field in per&s;on, and to employ a whole campaign, with the preceding autumn and the en&s;uing &s;pring, in the &s;erious pro&s;ecution of the war. The emperor pa&s;&s;ed the Danube on a bridge of boats, cut in pieces all that encountered his march, penetrated into the heart of the country of the Quadi, and &s;everely retaliated the calami|ties which they had inflicted on the Roman pro|vince. The di&s;mayed Barbarians were &s;oon re|duced to &s;ue for peace: they offered the re&s;titution of his captive &s;ubjects, as an atonement for the pa&s;t, and the noble&s;t ho&s;tages as a pledge of their future conduct. The generous courte&s;y which was &s;hewn to the fir&s;t among their chieftains who implored the clemency of Con&s;tantius, encou|raged the more timid, or the more ob&s;tinate, to imitate their example; and the Imperial camp was crowded with the princes and amba&s;&s;adors of the mo&s;t di&s;tant tribes, who occupied the plains of the Le&s;&s;er Poland, and who might have deemed them&s;elves &s;ecure behind the lofty ridge of the Carpathian mountains. While Con&s;tantius gave
<PB N="197" REF="204">
laws to the Barbarians beyond the Danube, he di&s;tingui&s;hed with &s;pecious compa&s;&s;ion the Sar|matian exiles, who had been expelled from their native country by the rebellion of their &s;laves, and who formed a very con&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ion to the power of the Quadi. The emperor, em|bracing a generous but artful &s;y&s;tem of policy, relea&s;ed the Sarmatians from the bands of this humiliating dependence, and re&s;tored them, by a &s;eparate treaty, to the dignity of a nation united under the government of a king, the friend and ally of the republic. He declared his re&s;o|lution of a&s;&s;erting the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e, and of &s;ecuring the peace of the provinces by the ex|tirpation, or at lea&s;t the bani&s;hment, of the Li|migantes, who&s;e manners were &s;till infected with the vices of their &s;ervile origin. The execution of this de&s;ign was attended with more difficulty than glory. The territory of the Limigantes was protected again&s;t the Romans by the Danube, again&s;t the ho&s;tile Barbarians by the Tey&s;s. The mar&s;hy lands which lay between tho&s;e rivers, and were often covered by their inundations, formed an intricate wilderne&s;s, pervious only to the inha|bitants, who were acquainted with its &s;ecret paths and inacce&s;&s;ible fortre&s;&s;es. On the approach of Con&s;tantius, the Limigantes tried the efficacy of prayers, of fraud, and of arms; but he &s;ternly rejected their &s;upplications, defeated their rude &s;tratagems, and repelled with &s;kill and firmne&s;s the efforts of their irregular valour. One of their mo&s;t warlike tribes, e&s;tabli&s;hed in a &s;mall i&s;land towards the conflux of the Tey&s;s and the
<PB N="198" REF="205">
Danube, con&s;ented to pa&s;s the river with the in|tention of &s;urpri&s;ing the emperor during the &s;ecurity of an amicable conference. They &s;oon became the victims of the perfidy which they meditated. Encompa&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide, tram|pled down by the cavalry, &s;laughtered by the &s;words of the legions, they di&s;dained to a&s;k for mercy; and with an undaunted countenance &s;till gra&s;ped their weapons in the agonies of death. After this victory a con&s;iderable body of Romans was landed on the oppo&s;ite banks of the Danube; the Taifalae, a Gothic tribe engaged in the &s;ervice of the empire, invaded the Limigantes on the &s;ide of the Tey&s;s; and their former ma&s;ters, the free Sarmatians, animated by hope and revenge, penetrated through the hilly country into the heart of their ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. A general conflagration revealed the huts of the Barbarians, which were &s;eated in the depth of the wilderne&s;s; and the &s;oldier fought with confidence on mar&s;hy ground, which it was dangerous for him to tread. In this extremity the brave&s;t of the Limigantes were re|&s;olved to die in arms, rather than to yield: but the milder &s;entiment, enforced by the authority of their elders, at length prevailed; and the &s;uppliant crowd, followed by their wives and children, repaired to the Imperial camp, to learn their fate from the mouth of the conqueror. After celebrating his own clemency, which was &s;till inclined to pardon their repeated crimes, and to &s;pare the remnant of a guilty nation, Con|&s;tantius a&s;&s;igned for the place of their exile a re|mote country, where they might enjoy a &s;afe and
<PB N="199" REF="206">
honourable repo&s;e. The Limigantes obeyed with reluctance; but before they could reach, at lea&s;t before they could occupy, their de&s;tined habita|tions, they returned to the banks of the Danube, exaggerating the hard&s;hips of their &s;ituation, and reque&s;ting, with fervent profe&s;&s;ions of fidelity, that the emperor would grant them an undi&s;turb|ed &s;ettlement within the limits of the Roman provinces. In&s;tead of con&s;ulting his own ex|perience of their incurable perfidy, Con&s;tantius li&s;tened to his flatterers, who were ready to repre|&s;ent the honour and advantage of accepting a colony of &s;oldiers, at a time when it was much ea&s;ier to obtain the pecuniary contributions, than the military &s;ervice of the &s;ubjects of the empire. The Limigantes were permitted to pa&s;s the Da|nube; and the emperor gave audience to the multitude in a large plain near the modern city of Buda. They &s;urrounded the tribunal, and &s;eem|ed to hear with re&s;pect an oration full of mildne&s;s and dignity; when one of the Barbarians, ca&s;t|ing his &s;hoe into the air, exclaimed with a loud voice, <HI>Marha! Marha!</HI> a word of defiance, which was received as the &s;ignal of the tumult. They ru&s;hed with fury to &s;eize the per&s;on of the em|peror; his royal throne and golden couch were pillaged by the&s;e rude hands; but the faithful defence of his guards, who died at his feet, allow|ed him a moment to mount a fleet hor&s;e, and to e&s;cape from the confu&s;ion. The di&s;grace which had been incurred by a treacherous &s;urpri&s;e was &s;oon retrieved by the numbers and di&s;cipline of the Romans; and the combat was only terminated
<PB N="200" REF="207">
by the extinction of the name and nation of the Limigantes. The free Sarmatians were rein&s;tated in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ancient &s;eats; and al|though Con&s;tantius di&s;tru&s;ted the levity of their character, he entertained &s;ome hopes that a &s;en&s;e of gratitude might influence their future conduct. He had remarked the lofty &s;tature and ob&s;equious demeanour of Zizais, one of the noble&s;t of their chiefs. He conferred on him the title of King; and Zizais proved that he was not unworthy to reign, by a &s;incere and la&s;ting attachment to the intere&s;t of his benefactor, who, after this &s;plendid &s;ucce&s;s, received the name of <HI>Sarmaticus</HI> from the acclamations of his victorious army <NOTE N="48" PLACE="foot">Genti Sarmatarum magno decori con&s;idens apud eos regem dedit.

As the lawful &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Darius Hy&s;ta&s;pes, Sapor a&s;&s;erted, that the river Strymon in Mace|donia was the true and ancient boundary of his empire; declaring, however, that as an evidence of his moderation, he would content him&s;elf with the provinces of Armenia and Me&s;opotamia, which had been fraudulently extorted from his ance&s;tors. He alleged, that, without the re|&s;titution of the&s;e di&s;puted countries, it was im|po&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h any treaty on a &s;olid and per|manent ba&s;is; and he arrogantly threatened, that if his amba&s;&s;ador returned in vain, he was pre|pared to take the field in the &s;pring, and to &s;up|port the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e by the &s;trength of his invincible arms.

After an ob&s;tinate combat, the Barbarians were repul&s;ed; they ince&s;&s;antly returned to the charge; they were again driven back with a dreadful &s;laughter, and two rebel le|gions of Gauls, who had been bani&s;hed into the Ea&s;t, &s;ignalized their undi&s;ciplined courage by a nocturnal &s;ally into the heart of the Per&s;ian camp.

The retired &s;chola&s;tic edu|cation of Julian, in which he had been more con|ver&s;ant with books than with arms, with the dead than with the living, left him in profound ignorance of the practical arts of war and govern|ment; and when he awkwardly repeated &s;ome military exerci&s;e which it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to learn, he exclaimed with a &s;igh, <Q>O Plato, Plato, what a ta&s;k for a philo&s;opher!</Q> Yet even this &s;peculative philo&s;ophy, which men of bu&s;i|ne&s;s are too apt to de&s;pi&s;e, had filled the mind of Julian with the noble&s;t precepts, and the mo&s;t &s;hining examples; had animated him with the love of virtue, the de&s;ire of fame, and the con|tempt of death.

During the rigour of a Gallic winter, he never &s;uffered a fire in his bed-chamber; and after a &s;hort and inter|rupted &s;lumber, he frequently ro&s;e in the middle of the night from a carpet &s;pread on the floor, to di&s;patch any urgent bu&s;ine&s;s, to vi&s;it his rounds, or to &s;teal a few moments for the pro&s;ecution of his favourite &s;tudies <NOTE N="67" PLACE="foot">The private life of Julian in Gaul, and the &s;evere di&s;cipline which he embraced, are di&s;played by Ammianus (xvi. 5.), who pro|fe&s;&s;es to prai&s;e, and by Julian him&s;elf, who affects to ridicule (Mi&s;o|pogon, p. 340.), a conduct, which, in a prince of the hou&s;e of Con&s;tantine, might ju&s;tly excite the &s;urpri&s;e of mankind.</NOTE>. The precepts of elo|quence, which he had hitherto practi&s;ed on fancied topics of declamation, were more u&s;efully applied to excite or to a&s;&s;uage the pa&s;&s;ions of an armed multitude: and although Julian, from his early habits of conver&s;ation and literature, was more fa|miliarly acquainted with the beauties of the Greek language, he had attained a competent know|ledge of the Latin tongue <NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot">Aderat Latine quoque di&s;&s;erenti &s;ufficiens &s;ermo.

But Julian, educated in the &s;chools of Greece, always con|&s;idered the language of the Romans as a foreign and popular dialect, which he might u&s;e on nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions.</NOTE>. Since Julian was not originally de&s;igned for the character of a le|gi&s;lator, or a judge, it is probable that the civil juri&s;prudence of the Romans had not engaged any con&s;iderable &s;hare of his attention: but he

derived from his philo&s;ophic &s;tudies an inflexible regard for ju&s;tice, tempered by a di&s;po&s;ition to clemency; the knowledge of the general prin|ciples of equity and evidence, and the faculty of patiently inve&s;tigating the mo&s;t intricate and te|dious que&s;tions which could be propo&s;ed for his di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The mea&s;ures of policy, and the ope|rations of war, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the various acci|dents of circum&s;tance and character, and the un|practi&s;ed &s;tudent will often be perplexed in the ap|plication of the mo&s;t perfect theory. But in the acqui&s;ition of this important &s;cience, Julian was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the active vigour of his own genius, as well as by the wi&s;dom and experience of Sallu&s;t, an officer of rank, who &s;oon conceived a &s;incere attachment for a prince &s;o worthy of his friend|&s;hip; and who&s;e incorruptible integrity was adorned by the talent of in&s;inuating the har&s;he&s;t truths, without wounding the delicacy of a royal ear <NOTE N="69" PLACE="foot">We are ignorant of the actual office of this excellent mini&s;ter, whom Julian afterwards created praefect of Gaul. Sallu&s;t was &s;peedily recalled by the jealou&s;y of the emperor; and we may &s;till read a &s;en&s;ible but pedantic di&s;cour&s;e (p. 240&mdash;252), in which Julian deplores the lo&s;s of &s;o valuable a friend, to whom he acknowledges him&s;elf indebted for his reputation, See La Bleterie, Preface &agrave; la Vie de Jovien, p. 20.</NOTE>.</P>

deliverance of Autun. That large and antient city, protected only by a ruined wall and pu&s;il|lanimous garri&s;on, was &s;aved by the generous re|&s;olution of a few veterans, who re&s;umed their arms for the defence of their country. In his march from Autun, through the heart of the Gallic provinces, Julian embraced with ardour the earlie&s;t opportunity of &s;ignalizing his courage. At the head of a &s;mall body of archers, and heavy cavalry, he preferred the &s;horter but the more dangerous of two roads; and &s;ometimes eluding, and &s;ometimes re&s;i&s;ting, the attacks of the Barba|rians, who were ma&s;ters of the field, he arrived with honour and &s;afety at the camp near Rheims, where the Roman troops had been ordered to a&s;|&s;emble. The a&s;pect of their young prince re|vived the drooping &s;pirit of the &s;oldiers, and they marched from Rheims in &s;earch of the enemy, with a confidence which had almo&s;t proved fatal to them. The Alemanni, familiarized to the knowledge of the country, &s;ecretly collected their &s;cattered forces, and &s;eizing the opportunity of a dark and rainy day, poured with unexpected fury on the rear-guard of the Romans. Before the in|evitable di&s;order could be remedied, two legions were de&s;troyed; and Julian was taught by expe|rience, that caution and vigilance are the mo&s;t important le&s;&s;ons of the art of war. In a &s;econd and more &s;ucce&s;sful action, he recovered and e&s;tab|li&s;hed his military fame; but as the agility of the Barbarians &s;aved them from the pur&s;uit, his vic|tory was neither bloody nor deci&s;ive. He ad|vanced, however, to the banks of the Rhine,
<PB N="219" REF="226">
&s;urveyed the ruins of Cologne, convinced him&s;elf of the difficulties of the war, and retreated on the approach of winter, di&s;contented with the court, with his army, and with his own &s;ucce&s;s <NOTE N="70" PLACE="foot">Ammianus (xvi. 2, 3.) appears much better &s;atisfied with the &s;ucce&s;s of this fir&s;t campaign than Julian him&s;elf; who very fairly owns that he did nothing of con&s;equence, and that he fled before the enemy.</NOTE>. The power of the enemy was yet unbroken; and the Cae&s;ar had no &s;ooner &s;eparated his troops, and fixed his own quarters at Sens, in the centre of Gaul, than he was &s;urrounded and be&s;ieged by a numerous ho&s;t of Germans. Reduced in this ex|tremity to the re&s;ources of his own mind, he di&s;|played a prudent intrepidity which compen&s;ated for all the deficiencies of the place and garri&s;on; and the Barbarians, at the end of thirty days, were obliged to retire with di&s;appointed rage.</P>
<P>The con&s;cious pride of Julian, who was in|debted <NOTE PLACE="marg">His &s;econd campaign,</NOTE> only to his &s;word for this &s;ignal deliver|ance, was embittered by the reflection, that he <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 357.</NOTE> was abandoned, betrayed, and perhaps devoted to de&s;truction, by tho&s;e who were bound to a&s;&s;i&s;t him by every tie of honour and fidelity. Mar|cellus, ma&s;ter-general of the cavalry in Gaul, in|terpreting too &s;trictly the jealous orders of the court, beheld with &s;upine indifference the di&s;tre&s;s of Julian, and had re&s;trained the troops under his command from marching to the relief of Sens. If the Cae&s;ar had di&s;&s;embled in &s;ilence &s;o danger|ous an in&s;ult, his per&s;on and authority would have been expo&s;ed to the contempt of the world; and if an action &s;o criminal had been &s;uffered to pa&s;s

with impunity, the emperor would have confirmed the &s;u&s;picions, which received a very &s;pecious co|lour from his pa&s;t conduct towards the princes of the Flavian family. Marcellus was recalled, and gently di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his office <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xvi. 7.

In his room Severus was appointed general of the cavalry; an experienced &s;oldier, of approved courage and fidelity, who could advi&s;e with re&s;pect, and exe|cute with zeal; and who &s;ubmitted, without re|luctance, to the &s;upreme command which Julian, by the intere&s;t of his patrone&s;s Eu&s;ebia, at length obtained over the armies of Gaul <NOTE N="72" PLACE="foot">Severus, non di&s;cors, non arrogans, &s;ed longa militiae frugali|tate compertus; et eum recta praeeuntem &s;ecuturus, ut ductorem mo|rigerus miles.

Julian him&s;elf, at the head of the remains of the veteran bands, and of &s;ome new levies which he had been permitted to form, boldly penetrated into the centre of the German cantonments, and carefully re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the for|tifications of Saverne, in an advantageous po&s;t, which would either check the incur&s;ions, or in|tercept the retreat, of the enemy. At the &s;ame time Barbatio, general of the infantry, advanced from Milan with an army of thirty thou&s;and men, and pa&s;&s;ing the mountains, prepared to throw a bridge over the Rhine, in the neighbourhood of Ba&s;il. It was rea&s;onable to expect that the Ale|manni, pre&s;&s;ed on either &s;ide by the Roman arms,
<PB N="221" REF="228">
would &s;oon be forced to evacuate the provinces of Gaul, and to ha&s;ten to the defence of their native country. But the hopes of the campaign were defeated by the incapacity, or the envy, or the &s;e|cret in&s;tructions, of Barbatio; who acted as if he had been the enemy of the Cae&s;ar, and the &s;ecret ally of the Barbarians. The negligence with which he permitted a troop of pillagers freely to pa&s;s, and to return almo&s;t before the gates of his camp, may be imputed to his want of abilities; but the trea&s;onable act of burning a number of boats, and a &s;uperfluous &s;tock of provi&s;ions, which would have been of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the army of Gaul, was an evidence of his ho&s;tile and criminal intentions. The Germans de&s;pi&s;ed an enemy who appeared de&s;titute either of power or of inclination to offend them; and the igno|minious retreat of Barbatio deprived Julian of the expected &s;upport; and left him to extricate him|&s;elf from a hazardous &s;ituation, where he could neither remain with &s;afety, nor retire with ho|nour <NOTE N="73" PLACE="foot">On the de&s;ign and failure of the co-operation between Julian and Barbatio, &s;ee Ammianus (xvi. 11.), and Libanius, Orat. x. p. 273.</NOTE>.</P>

He was followed by &s;ix other kings, by ten princes of regal extraction, by a long train of high-&s;pirited nobles, and by thirty-five thou|&s;and of the brave&s;t warriors of the tribes of Ger|many. The confidence derived from the view of their own &s;trength, was encrea&s;ed by the intelli|gence which they received from a de&s;erter, that the Cae&s;ar, with a feeble army of thirteen thou|&s;and men, occupied a po&s;t about one-and-twenty miles from their camp of Stra&s;burgh. With this inadequate force, Julian re&s;olved to &s;eek and to encounter the Barbarian ho&s;t; and the chance of a general action was preferred to the tedious and uncertain operation of &s;eparately engaging the di&s;per&s;ed parties of the Alemanni. The Romans marched in clo&s;e order, and in two columns, the cavalry on the right, the infantry on the left; and the day was &s;o far &s;pent when they appeared in &s;ight of the enemy, that Julian was de&s;irous of deferring the battle till the next morning, and of allowing his troops to recruit their exhau&s;ted &s;trength by the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments of &s;leep and food. Yielding, however, with &s;ome reluctance,
<PB N="223" REF="230">
to the clamours of the &s;oldiers, and even to the opinion of his council, he exhorted them to ju&s;|tify by their valour the eager impatience, which, in ca&s;e of a defeat, would be univer&s;ally branded with the epithets of ra&s;hne&s;s and pre&s;umption. The trumpets &s;ounded, the military &s;hout was heard through the field, and the two armies ru&s;h|ed with equal fury to the charge. The Cae&s;ar, who conducted in per&s;on his right wing, depended on the dexterity of his archers, and the weight of his cuira&s;&s;iers. But his ranks were in&s;tantly bro|ken by an irregular mixture of light-hor&s;e and of light-infantry, and he had the mortification of beholding the flight of &s;ix hundred of his mo&s;t renowned cuira&s;&s;iers <NOTE N="75" PLACE="foot">After the battle, Julian ventured to revive the rigour of ancient di&s;cipline, by expo&s;ing the&s;e fugitives in female apparel to the de|ri&s;ion of the whole camp.

The conflict between the two lines of infantry was ob&s;tinate and bloody. The Germans po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;uperiority of &s;trength and &s;tature, the Romans that of di&s;cipline and tem|per; and as the Barbarians, who &s;erved under the &s;tandard of the empire, united the re&s;pective advantages of both parties, their &s;trenuous efforts, guided by a &s;kilful leader, at length determined the event of the day.

Without allowing the Franks to unite or to deliberate, he &s;kilfully &s;pread his legions from Cologne to the ocean; and by the terror, as well as by the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms, &s;oon reduced the &s;uppliant tribes to implore the cle|mency, and to obey the commands, of their con|queror. The Chamavians &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively retired to their former habitations beyond the Rhine: but the Salians were permitted to po&s;&s;e&s;s their new e&s;tabli&s;hment of Toxandria, as the &s;ubjects and

When the Chamavians &s;ued for peace, he required the &s;on of their king, as the only ho&s;tage in whom he could rely.

&s;ide of the Meyn, which were plentifully &s;tored with corn and cattle, felt the ravages of an in|vading army. The principal hou&s;es, con&s;tructed with &s;ome imitation of Roman elegance, were con&s;umed by the flames; and the Cae&s;ar boldly advanced about ten miles, till his progre&s;s was &s;topped by a dark and impenetrable fore&s;t, under|mined by &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages, which threaten|ed, with &s;ecret &s;nares and ambu&s;h, every &s;tep of the a&s;&s;ailant. The ground was already covered with &s;now; and Julian, after repairing an ancient ca&s;tle which had been erected by Trajan, granted a truce of ten months to the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Bar|barians. At the expiration of the truce, Julian undertook a &s;econd expedition beyond the Rhine, to humble the pride of Surmar and Hortaire, two of the kings of the Alemanni, who had been pre|&s;ent at the battle of Stra&s;burgh. They promi&s;ed to re&s;tore all the Roman captives who yet remain|ed alive; and as the Cae&s;ar had procured an ex|act account from the cities and villages of Gaul, of the inhabitants whom they had lo&s;t, he detected every attempt to deceive him with a degree of readine&s;s and accuracy, which almo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed the belief of his &s;upernatural knowledge. His third expedition was &s;till more &s;plendid and im|portant than the two former. The Germans had collected their military powers, and moved along the oppo&s;ite banks of the river, with a de&s;ign of de&s;troying the bridge, and of preventing the pa&s;|&s;age of the Romans. But this judicious plan of defence was di&s;concerted by a &s;kilful diver&s;ion. Three hundred light armed and active &s;oldiers
<PB N="230" REF="237">
were detached in forty &s;mall boats, to fall down the &s;tream in &s;ilence, and to land at &s;ome di&s;tance from the po&s;ts of the enemy. They executed their orders with &s;o much boldne&s;s and celerity, that they had almo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed the Barbarian chiefs, who returned in the fearle&s;s confidence of intoxi|cation from one of their nocturnal fe&s;tivals. Without repeating the uniform and di&s;gu&s;ting tale of &s;laughter and deva&s;tation, it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that Julian dictated his own conditions of peace to &s;ix of the haughtie&s;t kings of the Alemanni, three of whom were permitted to view the &s;evere di&s;cipline and martial pomp of a Ro|man camp. Followed by twenty thou&s;and cap|tives, whom he had re&s;cued from the chains of the Barbarians, the Cae&s;ar repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, after terminating a war, the &s;ucce&s;s of which has been compared to the ancient glories of the Punic and Cimbric victories.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the valour and conduct of Julian <NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;tores the cities of Gaul.</NOTE> had &s;ecured an interval of peace, he applied him|&s;elf to a work more congenial to his humane and philo&s;ophic temper. The cities of Gaul, which had &s;uffered from the inroads of the Barbarians, he diligently repaired; and &s;even important po&s;ts, between Mentz and the mouth of the Rhine, are particularly mentioned, as having been rebuilt and fortified by the order of Julian <NOTE N="86" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xviii. 2.

The active zeal of Julian urged the pro&s;ecution of the work; and &s;uch was the &s;pirit which he had diffu&s;ed among the troops, that the auxiliaries them&s;elves, waving their exemption from any duties of fatigue, con|tended in the mo&s;t &s;ervile labours with the dili|gence of the Roman &s;oldiers.

The de&s;ertion of the former, and the mutiny of the latter, mu&s;t have been the fatal and inevitable con&s;equences of famine. The tillage of the provinces of Gaul had been inter|rupted by the calamities of war; but the &s;canty harve&s;ts of the continent were &s;upplied, by his pa|ternal care, from the plenty of the adjacent i&s;land. Six hundred large barks, framed in the fore&s;t of the Ardennes, made &s;everal voyages to the coa&s;t of Britain; and returning from thence laden with corn, &s;ailed up the Rhine, and di&s;tributed their cargoes to the &s;everal towns and fortre&s;&s;es along the banks of the river <NOTE N="87" PLACE="foot">We may credit Julian him&s;elf, Orat. ad S.

re&s;tored a free and &s;ecure navigation, which Con|&s;tantius had offered to purcha&s;e at the expence of his dignity, and of a tributary pre&s;ent of two thou|&s;and pounds of &s;ilver. The emperor par&s;imo|niou&s;ly refu&s;ed to his &s;oldiers the &s;ums which he granted with a lavi&s;h and trembling hand to the Barbarians. The dexterity, as well as the firm|ne&s;s of Julian, was put to a &s;evere trial, when he took the field with a di&s;contented army, which had already &s;erved two campaigns, without re|ceiving any regular pay or any extraordinary donative <NOTE N="88" PLACE="foot">The troops once broke out into a mutiny, immediately before the &s;econd pa&s;&s;age of the Rhine.

<P>A tender regard for the peace and happine&s;s of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil ad|mini&s;tra|tion of Julian.</NOTE> his &s;ubjects, was the ruling principle which di|rected, or &s;eemed to direct, the admini&s;tration of Julian <NOTE N="89" PLACE="foot">Ammian. xvi. 5. xviii. 1.

Be|fore he took the field, he devolved on the pro|vincial governors, mo&s;t of the public and private cau&s;es which had been referred to his tribunal; but, on his return, he carefully revi&s;ed their pro|ceedings, mitigated the rigour of the law, and pronounced a &s;econd judgment on the judges them&s;elves.

The prince who was inve&s;ted with the en&s;igns of royalty, might &s;ometimes pre&s;ume to correct the rapacious in&s;olence of the inferior agents; to ex|po&s;e their corrupt arts, and to introduce an equal and ea&s;ier mode of collection. But the manage|ment of the finances was more &s;afely entru&s;ted to Florentius, Praetorian praefect of Gaul, an effe|minate tyrant, incapable of pity or remor&s;e; and the haughty mini&s;ter complained of the mo&s;t decent and gentle oppo&s;ition, while Julian him&s;elf was rather inclined to cen&s;ure the weakne&s;s of his own behaviour. The Cae&s;ar had rejected with abhorrence, a mandate for the levy of an extra|ordinary tax; a new &s;uperdiction, which the prae|fect had offered for his &s;ignature; and the faithful picture of the public mi&s;ery, by which he had been obliged to ju&s;tify his refu&s;al, offended the court of Con&s;tantius. We may enjoy the plea|&s;ure of reading the &s;entiments of Julian, as he ex|pre&s;&s;es them with warmth and freedom in a letter to one of his mo&s;t intimate friends. After &s;tating

his own conduct, he proceeds in the following terms: <Q>Was it po&s;&s;ible for the di&s;ciple of Plato and Ari&s;totle to act otherwi&s;e than I have done?

The wi&s;dom of the emperors provided for the re&s;titution of all the civil and religious rights of which the Chri&s;tians had been &s;o unju&s;tly deprived. It was enacted, that the places of wor&s;hip, and public lands, which had been confi&s;cated, &s;hould be re&s;tored to the church, without di&s;pute, without delay, and without expence: and this &s;evere in|junction was accompanied with a gracious pro|mi&s;e, that if any of the purcha&s;ers had paid a fair and adequate price, they &s;hould be indemnified from the Imperial trea&s;ury. The &s;alutary regu|lations which guard the future tranquillity of the faithful, are framed on the principles of enlarged and equal toleration; and &s;uch an equality mu&s;t have been interpreted by a recent &s;ect as an ad|vantageous and honourable di&s;tinction. The two emperors proclaim to the world, that they have granted a free and ab&s;olute power to the Chri&s;|tians, and to all others, of following the religion which each individual thinks proper to prefer, to which he has addicted his mind, and which he may deem the be&s;t adapted to his own u&s;e. They carefully explain every ambiguous word, remove every exception, and exact from the governors of the provinces a &s;trict obedience to the true and &s;imple meaning of an edict, which was de&s;igned to e&s;tabli&s;h and &s;ecure, without any limitation, the claims of religious liberty. They conde&s;cend to a&s;&s;ign two weighty rea&s;ons which have induced them to allow this univer&s;al toleration: the hu|mane intention of con&s;ulting the peace and hap|pine&s;s

From the&s;e vague and inde|finite expre&s;&s;ions of piety, three &s;uppo&s;itions may be deduced, of a different, but not of an incom|patible, nature. The mind of Con&s;tantine might fluctuate between the Pagan and the Chri&s;tian re|ligions.

may naturally be referred to the e&s;teem which he entertained for the moral character of the Chri&s;|tians; and to a per&s;ua&s;ion, that the propagation of the go&s;pel would inculcate the practice of pri|vate and public virtue. Whatever latitude an ab&s;olute monarch may a&s;&s;ume in his own conduct, whatever indulgence he may claim for his own pa&s;&s;ions, it is undoubtedly his intere&s;t that all his &s;ubjects &s;hould re&s;pect the natural and civil obliga|tions of &s;ociety. But the operation of the wi&s;e&s;t laws is imperfect and precarious. They &s;eldom in&s;pire virtue, they cannot always re&s;train vice. Their power is in&s;ufficient to prohibit all that they condemn, nor can they always puni&s;h the actions which they prohibit. The legi&s;lators of antiquity had &s;ummoned to their aid the powers of educa|tion and of opinion. But every principle which had once maintained the vigour and purity of Rome and Sparta, was long &s;ince extingui&s;hed in a declining and de&s;potic empire. Philo&s;ophy &s;till exerci&s;ed her temperate &s;way over the human mind, but the cau&s;e of virtue derived very feeble &s;upport from the influence of the Pagan &s;uper&s;ti|tion.

<P>The a&s;&s;urance that the elevation of Con&s;tan|tine <NOTE PLACE="marg">Loyalty and zeal of the Chri&s;t|ian party.</NOTE> was intimately connected with the de&s;igns of Providence, in&s;tilled into the minds of the Chri&s;t|ians two opinions, which, by very different means, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the accompli&s;hment of the prophecy. Their warm and active loyalty exhau&s;ted in his favour every re&s;ource of human indu&s;try; and they confidently expected that their &s;trenuous ef|forts would be &s;econded by &s;ome divine and mira|culous aid. The enemies of Con&s;tantine have imputed to intere&s;ted motives the alliance which he in&s;en&s;ibly contracted with the Catholic church, and which apparently contributes to the &s;ucce&s;s of his ambition.

The di&s;cretion of parents often &s;u&s;pended the bapti&s;m of their children till they could under&s;tand the obligations which they con|tracted: the &s;everity of ancient bi&s;hops exacted from the new converts a noviciate of two or three years; and the catechumens them&s;elves, from different motives of a temporal or a &s;piritual na|ture, were &s;eldom impatient to a&s;&s;ume the cha|racter of perfect and initiated Chri&s;tians.

Among the pro&s;elytes of Chri&s;tianity, there were many who judged it imprudent to precipitate a &s;alutary rite, which could not be repeated; to throw away an ine&s;timable privilege, which could never be recovered.

<P>THE grateful applau&s;e of the clergy has con&s;ecrated the memory of a prince who indulged their pa&s;&s;ions and promoted their in|tere&s;t. Con&s;tantine gave them &s;ecurity, wealth, honours, and revenge: and the &s;upport of the orthodox faith was con&s;idered as the mo&s;t &s;acred and important duty of the civil magi&s;trate. The edict of Milan, the great charter of toleration, had confirmed to each individual of the Roman world, the privilege of chu&s;ing and profe&s;&s;ing his own religion. But this ine&s;timable privilege was &s;oon violated: with the knowledge of truth, the emperor imbibed the maxims of per&s;ecution; and the &s;ects which di&s;&s;ented from the Catholic church, were afflicted and oppre&s;&s;ed by the triumph of Chri&s;tianity. Con&s;tantine ea&s;ily believed that the Heretics, who pre&s;umed to di&s;pute <HI>his</HI> opinions, or to oppo&s;e <HI>his</HI> commands, were guilty of the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and criminal ob&s;tinacy; and that a &s;ea&s;onable application of moderate &s;everities might &s;ave tho&s;e unhappy men from the danger of an everla&s;ting condemnation. Not a moment was lo&s;t in excluding the mini&s;ters and teachers of the &s;eparated congregations from any &s;hare of the rewards and immunities which the emperor had
<PB N="307" REF="314">
&s;o liberally be&s;towed on the orthodox clergy. But as the &s;ectaries might &s;till exi&s;t under the cloud of royal di&s;grace, the conque&s;t of the Ea&s;t was immediately followed by an edict which announced their total de&s;truction <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;ebius in Vit.

The &s;ects again&s;t whom the Imperial &s;everity was directed, appear to have been the adherents of Paul of Samo&s;ata; the Montani&s;ts of Phrygia, who main|tained an enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of prophecy; the Novatians, who &s;ternly rejected the temporal efficacy of repentance; the Marcionites and Va|lentinians, under who&s;e leading banners the various Gno&s;tics of A&s;ia and Egypt had in&s;en&s;ibly rallied; and perhaps the Manichaeans, who had recently imported from Per&s;ia a more artful compo&s;ition of Oriental and Chri&s;tian theology <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">After &s;ome examination of the various opinions of Tillemont, Beau&s;obre, Lardner, &amp;c.

As the ju&s;tice of the &s;entence was publicly avowed by the whole party, the only motive which could re&s;train Con&s;tantius from giving his me&s;&s;engers the &s;anction of a writ|ten mandate, mu&s;t be imputed to his doubt of the event; and to a &s;en&s;e of the danger to which he might expo&s;e the &s;econd city, and the mo&s;t fer|tile province of the empire, if the people &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in the re&s;olution of defending, by force of arms, the innocence of their &s;piritual father.

The civil powers of Egypt found them&s;elves inadequate to the ta&s;k of per&s;uading or compelling the primate to abdicate his epi&s;copal throne; and they were obliged to conclude a treaty with the popular leaders of Alexandria, by which it was &s;tipulated, that all proceedings and all ho&s;tilities &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended till the emperor's plea&s;ure had been more di&s;tinctly a&s;certained.

Many of the faithful were killed; who may de|&s;erve the name of martyrs, if their deaths were neither provoked nor revenged; bi&s;hops and pre&s;byters were treated with cruel ignominy; con|&s;ecrated virgins were &s;tripped naked, &s;courged, and violated; the hou&s;es of wealthy citizens were plundered; and, under the ma&s;k of reli|gious zeal, lu&s;t, avarice, and private re&s;entment, were gratified with impunity, and even with ap|plau&s;e.

The u&s;urper, after receiving the con|&s;ecration of an Arian &s;ynod, was placed on the epi&s;copal throne by the arms of Seba&s;tian, who had been appointed Count of Egypt for the exe|cution

Encouraged by &s;uc|ce&s;s, Con&s;tantius ventured to approve the conduct of his mini&s;ters.

A report, that the ceremonies of pagani&s;m were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, is formally contradicted by the em|peror him&s;elf, who wi&s;ely a&s;&s;igns, as the principle of his moderation, the invincible force of habit, of prejudice, and of &s;uper&s;tition <NOTE N="165" PLACE="foot">See Eu&s;ebius in Vit.

The divi&s;ions of Chri&s;tianity &s;u&s;pended the ruin of <HI>pagani&s;m</HI> <NOTE N="173" PLACE="foot">As I have freely anticipated the u&s;e of <HI>pagans</HI> and pagani&s;m, I &s;hall now trace the &s;ingular revolutions of tho&s;e celebrated words. 1. <GAP DESC="foreign">, in the Doric dialect, &s;o familiar to the Italians, &s;ignifies a fountain; and the rural neighbourhood which frequented the &s;ame fountain, derived the common appellation of <HI>pagus</HI> and <HI>pagans</HI> (Ee&s;tus &s;ub voce, and Servius ad Virgil. Georgic. ii. 382.). 2. By an ea&s;y exten&s;ion of the word, <HI>pagan</HI> and rural became almo&s;t &s;ynonymous (Plin. Hi&s;t. Natur. xxviii. 5.); and the meaner ru&s;tics acquired that name, which has been corrupted into <HI>pea&s;ants</HI> in the modern languages of Europe. 3. The amazing increa&s;e of the military order intro|duced the nece&s;&s;ity of a correlative term (Hume's E&s;&s;ays, vol. i. p. 555.); and all the <HI>people</HI> who were not enli&s;ted in the &s;ervice of the prince were branded with the contemptuous epithet of pagans (Tacit. Hi&s;t. iii. 24. 43. 77. Juvenal. Satir. xvi. Tertullian de Pallio, c. 4.). 4. The Chri&s;tians were the &s;oldiers of Chri&s;t; their adver&s;aries, who refu&s;ed his <HI>&s;acrament,</HI> or military oath of bapti&s;m, might de&s;erve the metaphorical name of pagans; and this popular reproach was introduced as early as the reign of Valentinian (A. D. 365.) into Imperial laws (Cod. Theodo&s;. l. xvi. tit. ii. leg. 18.) and theological writings. 5. Chri&s;tianity gradually filled the cities of the empire: the old religion, in the time of Prudentius (adver&s;. Symmachum, l. i. ad fin.) and Oro&s;ius (in Praefat. Hi&s;t.), retired and langui&s;hed in ob&s;cure villages; and the word <HI>pagans,</HI> with its new &s;ig|nification, reverted to its primitive origin. 6. Since the wor&s;hip of Jupiter and his family has expired, the vacant title of pagans has been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively applied to all the idolaters and polythei&s;ts of the old and new world. 7. The Latin Chri&s;tians be&s;towed it, without &s;cruple, on their mortal enemies the Mahometans; and the pure&s;t <HI>unitarians</HI> were branded with the unju&s;t reproach of idolatry and pa|gani&s;m. See Gerard Vo&s;&s;ius Etymologicon Linguae Latinae, in his works, tom. i. p. 420. Godefroy's Commentary on the Theodo&s;ian Code, tom. vi. p. 250. and Ducange, mediae &amp; infimae Latinitat. Glo&s;&s;ar.</NOTE>; and the holy war again&s;t the in|fidels was le&s;s vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted by princes and bi&s;hops, who were more immediately alarmed by the guilt and danger of dome&s;tic rebellion. The extirpation of <HI>idolatry</HI> <NOTE N="174" PLACE="foot">In the pure language of Ionia and Athens, <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign"> were ancient and familiar words. The former expre&s;&s;ed a likene&s;s, an apparition (Homer. Ody&s;&s;. xi. 601.) a repre&s;entation, an <HI>image,</HI> created either by fancy or art. The latter denoted any &s;ort of <HI>&s;ervice</HI> or &s;lavery. The Jews of Egypt, who tran&s;lated the Hebrew &s;crip|tures, re&s;trained the u&s;e of the&s;e words (Exod. xx. 4, 5.) to the re|ligious wor&s;hip of an image. The peculiar idiom of the Helleni&s;ts, or Grecian Jews, has been adopted by the &s;acred and eccle&s;ia&s;tical writers; and the reproach of <HI>idolatry</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) has &s;tigmatized that vi&s;ible and abject mode of &s;uper&s;tition, which &s;ome &s;ects of Chri&s;tianity &s;hould not ha&s;tily impute to the polythei&s;ts of Greece and Rome.</NOTE> might have been

ju&s;tified by the e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of intole|rance: but the ho&s;tile &s;ects, which alternately reigned in the Imperial court, were mutually ap|prehen&s;ive of alienating, and perhaps exa&s;perat|ing, the minds of a powerful, though declining faction. Every motive of authority and fa&s;hion, of intere&s;t and rea&s;on, now militated on the &s;ide of Chri&s;tianity; but two or three generations elap&s;ed, before their victorious influence was univer&s;ally felt. The religion which had &s;o long and &s;o lately been e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Roman em|pire was &s;till revered by a numerous people, le&s;s attached indeed to &s;peculative opinion, than to ancient cu&s;tom. The honours of the &s;tate and army were indifferently be&s;towed on all the &s;ub|jects of Con&s;tantine and Con&s;tantius; and a con|&s;iderable portion of knowledge and wealth and valour was &s;till engaged in the &s;ervice of poly|thei&s;m. The &s;uper&s;tition of the &s;enator and of the pea&s;ant, of the poet and the philo&s;opher, was derived from very different cau&s;es, but they met with equal devotion in the temples of the gods. Their zeal was in&s;en&s;ibly provoked by the in&s;ult|ing triumph of a pro&s;cribed &s;ect; and their hopes
