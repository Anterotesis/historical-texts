<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON THE GESTA ROMANORUM.</HEAD>
<P>TALES are the learning of a rude age. In the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">og<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s of letters, &s;peculation and enquiry commence with re|finement of manners. Literature becomes &s;entimental and di&s;cur&s;ive, in proportion as a people is poli&s;hed: and men mu&s;t be in&s;tructed by facts, either real or imaginary, before they can apprehend the &s;ubtleties of argument, and the force of ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ection.</P>
<P>Vincent of Beauvais, a learned Dominican of France, who flou|ri&s;hed in the thirteenth century, ob&s;erves in his MIRROR of HISTORY, that it was a practice of the preachers of his age, to rou&s;e the indifference and relieve the languor of their hearers, by quoting the fables of E&s;op: yet, at the &s;ame time, he re|commends a &s;paring and prudent application of the&s;e profane fancies in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of &s;acred &s;ubjects <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">SPECUL.

manu&s;cripts in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum we find a very antient collection of two hundred and fifteen &s;tories, romantic, allegorical, religious, and legendary, which were evidently compiled by a profe&s;&s;ed preacher, for the u&s;e of mona&s;tic &s;ocieties. Some of the&s;e ap|pear to have been committed to writing from the recitals of bards and min&s;trels: others to have been invented and written by troubadours and monks <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">MSS. HARL. 463. membran. fol.</NOTE>. In the year 1389, a grand &s;y&s;tem of divinity appeared at Paris, afterwards tran&s;lated by Caxton under the title of the COURT OF SAPYENCE, which abounds with a multitude of hi&s;torical examples, parables, and apologues; and which the writer wi&s;ely &s;uppo&s;es, to be much more likely to intere&s;t the attention and excite the devotion of the people, than the authority of &s;cience, and the parade of theology. In con&s;equence of the expediency of this mode of of in&s;truction, the Legends of the Saints were received into the ritual, and rehear&s;ed in the cour&s;e of public wor&s;hip. For religious romances were nearly allied to &s;ongs of chivalry; and the &s;ame gro&s;s ignorance of the people, which in the early centuries of chri&s;tianity created a nece&s;&s;ity of introducing the vi&s;ible pomp of theatrical ceremonies into the churches, was taught the duties of devotion, by being amu&s;ed with the achieve|ments of &s;piritual knight-errantry, and impre&s;&s;ed with the ex|amples of pious heroi&s;m. In more cultivated periods, the DECA|MERON of Boccace, and other books of that kind, ought to be con&s;idered as the remnant of a &s;pecies of writing which was founded on the &s;implicity of mankind, and was adapted to the exigencies of the infancy of &s;ociety.</P>

<P><PB N="iii" REF="10">
But among the antient &s;tory-books of this character, a Latin compilation entitled GESTA ROMANORUM &s;eems to have been the favorite.</P>
<P>This piece has been before incidentally noticed: but as it operated powerfully on the general body of our old poetry, affording a variety of inventions not only to Chaucer, Gower, and Lydgate, but to their di&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, I have judged it of &s;ufficient importance to be examined at large in a &s;eparate di&s;&s;er|tation: which has been de&s;ignedly re&s;erved for this place, for the purpo&s;e both of recapitulation and illu&s;tration, and of giving the reader a more commodious opportunity of &s;urveying at lei&s;ure, from this intermediate point of view, and under one comprehen&s;ive detail, a connected di&s;play of the materials and original &s;ubjects of many of our pa&s;t and future poets.</P>
<P>Indeed, in the times with which we are now about to be con|cerned, it &s;eems to have been growing more into e&s;teem. At the commencement of typography, Wynkyn de Worde pub|li&s;hed this book in Engli&s;h. This tran&s;lation wasre printed, by one Robin&s;on, in 1577. And afterwards, of the &s;ame tran&s;la|tion there were &s;ix impre&s;&s;ions before the year 1601 <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See &s;upr. vol. ii. p. 18. &s;eq.</NOTE>. There is an edition in black letter &s;o late as the year 1689. About the year 1596, an Engli&s;h ver&s;ion appeared of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Epitomes des cent HISTOIRES TRAGIQUES, partie extraictes des ACTES DE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ROMAINS et autres, &amp;c."</Q> From the popularity, or rather familiarity, of this work in the reign of queen Eli&s;abeth, the title of GESTA GRAYORUM was affixed to the hi&s;tory of the acts of the Chri&s;tmas Prince at Grays-inn, in 1594 <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Printed, or reprinted, in 1688. 4to.</NOTE>. In Sir GILES GOOSECAP, an anonymous comedy, pre&s;ented by the Children of the Chapel in the year 1606, we have, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then for your lord&s;hip's quips and quick je&s;ts, why GESTA RO|MANORUM were nothing to them <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Lond.

<P>The GESTA ROMANORUM were fir&s;t printed without date, but as it is &s;uppo&s;ed before or about the year 1473, in folio, with this title, <HI>Incipiunt</HI> HISTORIE NOTABILES <HI>collecte ex</HI> GESTIS ROMANORUM <HI>et quibu&s;dam aliis libris cum applicationibus eorundem</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Much the &s;ame title occurs to a ma|nu&s;cript of this work in the Vatican, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hi&s;toriae Notabiles collectae ex Ge&s;tis Romanorum et quibu&s;dam aliis libris cum explicationibus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">orundem."</Q> Mont|fauc.

The next edition, with the u&s;e of which I have been politely favoured by George Ma&s;on e&s;quire, of Aldenham-Lodge in Hertford&s;hire, was printed in folio, and in the year 1488, with this title, GESTA RHOMA|NORUM <HI>cum Applicationibus morali&s;atis et mi&s;ticis.</HI> The colophon is, <HI>Ex</HI> GESTIS ROMANORUM <HI>cum pluribus applicatis Hi&s;toriis de virtutibus et viciis my&s;tice ad intellectum tran&s;&s;umptis Recollectorii finis.

The book, which is printed in two columns, and in the Gothic cha|racter, abounding with abbreviations, contains ninety-three leaves. The initials are written or flouri&s;hed in red and blue, and all the capitals in the body of the text are miniated with a pen. There were many other later editions <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">For which &s;ee &s;upr. vol. ii. p. 15.</NOTE>. I mu&s;t add, that the GESTA ROMANORUM were tran&s;lated into Dutch, &s;o early as the year 1484. There is an old French ver&s;ion in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum.</P>
<P>This work is compiled from the ob&s;olete Latin chronicles of the later Roman or rather German &s;tory, heightened by roman|tic inventions, from Legends of the Saints, oriental apologues, and many of the &s;horter fictitious narratives which came into Europe with the Arabian literature, and were familiar in the ages of ignorance and imagination. The cla&s;&s;ics are &s;ometimes cited for authorities; but the&s;e are of the lower order, &s;uch as Valerius Maximus, Macrobius, Aulus Gallius, Seneca, Pliny, and Boethius. To every tale a MORALISATION is &s;ubjoined, reducing it into a chri&s;tian or moral le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the oriental apologues are taken from the CLERICA|LIS DISCIPLINA, or a latin Dialogue between an Arabian Philo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">opher

<P>Our author frequently cites GESTA ROMANORUM, the title of his own work. By which I under&s;tand no particular book of that name, but the Roman Hi&s;tory in general. Thus in the title of the SAINT ALBANS CHRONICLE, printed by Caxton, <HI>Titus Livyus</HI> de GESTIS ROMANORUM is recited. In the year 1544, Lucius Florus was printed at Paris under the &s;ame title <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Apud Va&s;co&s;an. 4to.</NOTE>.

The ROMULEON, an old manu&s;cript hi&s;tory of Rome from the foundation of the city to Con&s;tantine the Great, is al&s;o called de GESTIS ROMANORUM.

Gower, in the CONFESSIO AMANTIS, often introduces Roman &s;tories with the Latin preamble, <HI>Hic &s;ecundum</HI> GESTA. Where he certainly means the Roman Hi&s;tory, which by degrees had acquired &s;imply the appellation of GESTA. Herman Korner, in his CHRONICA NOVELLA, written about the year 1438, refers for his vouchers to Bede, Oro&s;ius, Vale|rius Maximus, Jo&s;ephus, Eu&s;ebius, and the <HI>Chronicon</HI> et GESTA ROMANORUM. Mo&s;t probably, to &s;ay no more, by the CHRO|NICON he means the later writers of the Roman affairs, &s;uch as I&s;idore and the monki&s;h compilers; and by GESTA the antient Roman hi&s;tory, as related by Livy and the more e&s;tabli&s;hed Latin hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>Neither is it po&s;&s;ible that this work could have been brought as a proof or authority, by any &s;erious annali&s;t, for the Roman &s;tory.</P>
<P>For though it bears the title of GESTA ROMANORUM, yet this title by no means properly corre&s;ponds with the contents of the collection: which, as has been already hinted, comprehends a multitude of narratives, either not hi&s;torical; or, in another re&s;pect, &s;uch as are either totally unconnected with the Roman people, or perhaps the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous mi&s;repre&s;entations of their hi&s;tory. To cover this deviation from the promi&s;ed plan, which, by introducing a more ample variety of matter, has contributed to encrea&s;e the reader's entertainment, our col|lector has taken care to preface almo&s;t every &s;tory with the name or reign of a Roman emperor; who, at the &s;ame time, is often a monarch that never exi&s;ted, and who &s;eldom, whether real or &s;uppo&s;itious, has any concern with the circum&s;tances of the narrative. </P>

But I ha&s;ten to exhibit a compendious analy&s;is of the chap|ters which form this very &s;ingular compilation: intermixing occa&s;ional illu&s;trations ari&s;ing from the &s;ubject, and &s;hortening or lengthening my abridgement of the &s;tories, in proportion as I judge they are likely to intere&s;t the reader. Where, for that rea&s;on, I have been very conci&s;e, I have yet &s;aid enough to direct the critical antiquarian to this collection, in ca&s;e he &s;hould find a &s;imilar tale occurring in any of our old poets. I have omitted the mention of a very few chapters, which were beneath notice. Sometimes, where common authors are quoted, I have only mentioned the author's name, without &s;pecifying the &s;ub&s;tance of the quotation. For it was nece&s;&s;ary that the reader &s;hould be made acquainted with our collector's track of reading, and the books which he u&s;ed. In the mean time, this review will &s;erve as a full notification of the edition of 1488, which is more comprehen&s;ive and complete than &s;ome others of later publication, and to which all the re&s;t, as to a general criterion, may be now comparatively referred.</P>
<P>CHAP. i. Of a daughter of king Pompey, who&s;e chamber was guarded by five armed knights and a dog. Being permitted to be pre&s;ent at a public &s;hew, &s;he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">educed by a duke, who is afterwards killed by the champion of her father's court. She is reconciled to her father, and betrothed to a nobleman: on which occa&s;ion, &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> receives from her father an embroidered robe and a crown of gold, from the champion a gold ring, ano|ther from the wi&s;e man who pacified the king's anger, another from the king's &s;on, another from her cou&s;in, and from her &s;pou&s;e a &s;eal of gold. All the&s;e pre&s;ents are in&s;cribed with pro|verbial &s;entences, &s;uitable to the circum&s;tances of the prince&s;s.</P>
<P>The latter part of this &s;tory is evidently oriental. The feudal manners, in a book which profe&s;&s;es to record the achievements of the Roman people, are remarkable in the introductory cir|cum&s;tances. But of this mixture we &s;hall &s;ee many &s;triking in&s;tances.</P>
<P>CHAP. ii. Of a youth taken captive by pirates. The king's
<PB N="ix" REF="16">
daughter falls in love with him; and having procured his e&s;cape, accompanies him to his own country, where they are married.</P>
<P>CHAP. vi. An emperor is married to a beautiful young prin|ce&s;s. In ca&s;e of death, they mutually agree not to &s;urvive one other. To try the truth of his wife, the emperor going into a di&s;tant country, orders a report of his death to be circulated. In remembrance of her vow, and in imitation of the wives of India, &s;he prepares to throw her&s;elf headlong from a high pre|cipice. She is prevented by her father; who interpo&s;es his pa|ternal authority, as predominating over a ra&s;h and unlawful promi&s;e.</P>
<P>CHAP. vii. Under the reign of Diocle&s;ian, a noble knight had two &s;ons, the younge&s;t of which marries a harlot.</P>
<P>This &s;tory, but with a difference of circum&s;tances, ends like the beautiful apologue of the Prodigal Son.</P>
<P>CHAP. viii. The emperor Leo commands three female &s;ta|tues to be made. One has a gold ring on a finger pointing for|ward, another a beard of gold, and the third a golden cloak and purple tunic. Whoever &s;teals any of the&s;e ornaments, is to be puni&s;hed with an ignominious death.</P>

<P>CHAP. x. Ve&s;pa&s;ian marries a wife in a di&s;tant country, who refu&s;es to return home with him, and yet declares &s;he will kill her&s;elf if he goes. The emperor ordered two rings to be made, of a wonderous efficacy; one of which, in the &s;tone, has the image of Oblivion, the other the image of Memory: the ring of Oblivion he gave to the empre&s;s, and returned home with the ring of Memory.</P>
<P>CHAP. xi. The queen of the &s;outh &s;ends her daughter to king Alexander, to be his concubine. She was exceedingly beautiful, but had been nouri&s;hed with poi&s;on from her birth. Alexander's ma&s;ter, Ari&s;totle, who&s;e &s;agacity nothing could e&s;cape, knowing this, entreated, that before &s;he was admitted to the king's bed, a malefactor condemned to death might be &s;ent for, who &s;hould give her a ki&s;s in the pre&s;ence of the king. The malefactor, on ki&s;&s;ing her, in&s;tantly dropped down dead.

A knight named Julian is hunting a &s;tag, who turns and &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"you will kill your father and mother."</Q> On this he went into a di&s;tant country, where he married a rich Lady of a ca&s;tle. Julian's father and mother travelled into va|rious lands to find their &s;on, and at length accidentally came to this ca&s;tle, in his ab&s;ence; where telling their &s;tory to the lady, who had heard it from her hu&s;band, &s;he di&s;covered who they were, and gave them her own bed to &s;leep in. Early in the morning, while &s;he was at ma&s;s in the chapel, her hu&s;band Julian unexpectedly returned; and entering his wife's chamber, perceived two per&s;ons in the bed, whom he immediately &s;lew with his &s;word, ha&s;tily &s;uppo&s;ing them to be his wife and her adulterer. At leaving the chamber, he met his wife coming from the cha|pel; and with great a&s;toni&s;hment a&s;ked her, who the per&s;ons were &s;leeping in her bed?

<P>I take this opportunity of ob&s;erving, that the Legends of the the Saints, &s;o frequently referred to in the GESTA ROMA|NORUM, often contain high &s;trokes of fancy, both in the &s;tructure and decorations of the &s;tory. That they &s;hould abound in extravagant conceptions, may be partly accounted for, from the &s;uper&s;titious and vi&s;ionary ca&s;t of the writer: but the truth is, they derive this complexion from the ea&s;t. Some were originally forged by monks of the Greek church, to whom the oriental fictions and mode of fabling were familiar. The more early of the Latin lives were carried over to Con&s;tantinople, where they were tran&s;lated into Greek with new embelli&s;hments of ea&s;tern imagination. The&s;e being returned into Europe, were tran&s;lated into Latin, where they naturally &s;uper&s;eded the old Latin arche|types. Others of the Latin lives contracted this tincture, from being written after the Arabian literature became common in Europe. The following ideas in the Life of Saint Pelagian
<PB N="xvi" REF="23">
evidently betray their original. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As the bys&s;hop &s;ange ma&s;&s;e in the cyte of U&s;anance, he &s;aw thre dropes ryghte clere all of one gratene&s;&s;e whiche were upon the aulter, and al thre ranne to gyder in to a precyous gemme: and whan they had &s;et thys gemme in a cro&s;&s;e of golde, al the other precyous &s;tones that were there, fyllen<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fell out.</NOTE> out, and thys gemme was clere to them that were clene out of &s;ynne, and it was ob&s;cure and darke to &s;ynners <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Caxton's GOLD.

<P>Po&s;&s;evin, a learned Je&s;uit, who wrote about the clo&s;e of the &s;ixteenth century, complains, that for the la&s;t five hundred years the courts of all the princes in Europe had been infatuated by reading romances: and that, in his time, it was a mark of in|elegance, not to be familiarly acquainted with Lancelot du Lake, Percefore&s;t, Tri&s;tan, Giron the Courteous, Amadis de Gaul, Primaleon, Boccace's Decameron, and Ario&s;to. He even goes &s;o far as to &s;ay, that the devil in&s;tigated Luther to procure a tran&s;la|tion of Amadis from Spani&s;h into French, for the purpo&s;e of facilitating his grand &s;cheme of overthrowing the catholic reli|gion. The popularity of this book, he adds, warped the minds of the French nation from their antient notions and &s;tudies; introduced a neglect of the &s;criptures, and propagated a love for a&s;trology, and other fanta&s;tic arts <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">BI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">LIOTH. SELECT. Lib. i. cap. 25. p. 113. edit. 1593.</NOTE>. But with the leave of this zealous catholic I would ob&s;erve, that this &s;ort of reading was likely to produce, if any, an effect quite contrary. The genius of romance and of popery was the &s;ame; and both were &s;trengthened by the reciprocation of a &s;imilar &s;pirit of cre|dulity. The dragons and the ca&s;tles of the one, were of a piece with the vi&s;ions and pretended miracles of the other. The ridiculous theories of fal&s;e and un&s;olid &s;cience, which, by the way, had been familiari&s;ed to the French by other ro|mances, long before the tran&s;lation of Amadis, were &s;urely more likely to be advanced under the influence of a religion founded on

deception, than in con&s;equence of Luther's reformed &s;y&s;tem, which aimed at purity and truth, and which was to gain its end by the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of antient prejudices.</P>
<P>Many of the ab&s;urdities of the catholic wor&s;hip were per|haps, as I have hinted, in &s;ome degree nece&s;&s;ary in the early ages of the church, on account of the ignorance of the people; at lea&s;t, under &s;uch circum&s;tances they were natural, and there|fore excu&s;able. But when the world became wi&s;er, tho&s;e mum|meries &s;hould have been aboli&s;hed, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that the preachers left off quoting E&s;op's fables in their &s;ermons, and the &s;tage cea&s;ed to in&s;truct the people in the &s;cripture-hi&s;tory by the repre&s;entation of the MYSTERIES. The advocates of the pa|pal communion do not con&s;ider, that in a cultivated age, abound|ing with every &s;pecies of knowledge, they continue to retain tho&s;e fooleries which were calculated only for chri&s;tians in a con|dition of barbari&s;m, and of which the u&s;e now no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>CHAP. xix. When Julius Ce&s;ar was preparing to pa&s;s the Rubicon, a gigantic &s;pectre appeared from the middle of the river, threatening to interrupt his pa&s;&s;age, if he came not to e&s;tabli&s;h the peace of Rome. Our author cites the GESTA ROMANORUM for this &s;tory.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible that the Roman hi&s;tory could pa&s;s through the dark ages, without being infected with many romantic cor|ruptions. Indeed, the Roman was almo&s;t the only antient hi&s;tory, which the readers of tho&s;e ages knew: and what re|lated even to pagan Rome, the parent of the more modern papal metropolis of chri&s;tianity, was regarded with a &s;uper&s;ti|tious veneration, and often magnified with miraculous additions.</P>

<P>CHAP. lxxx. A devout hermit lived in a cave, near which a &s;hepherd folded his flock. Many of the &s;heep being &s;tolen, the &s;hepherd was unju&s;tly killed by his ma&s;ter as being con|cerned in the theft. The hermit &s;eeing an innocent man put to death, began to &s;u&s;pect the exi&s;tence of a divine Providence; and re&s;olved no longer to perplex him&s;elf with the u&s;ele&s;s &s;eve|ties of religion, but to mix in the world. In travelling from his retirement, he was met by an angel in the figure of a man; who &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am an angel, and am &s;ent by God to be your companion on the road."</Q> They entered a city; and begged for lodging at the hou&s;e of a knight, who entertained them at a &s;plendid &s;upper. In the night, the angel ro&s;e from his bed, and &s;trangled the knight's only child who was a&s;leep in the
<PB N="xxix" REF="36">
cradle. The hermit was a&s;toni&s;hed at this barbarous return for &s;o much ho&s;pitality, but was afraid to make any remon&s;trance to his companion. Next morning they went to another city. Here they were liberally received in the hou&s;e of an opulent citizen; but in the night the angel ro&s;e, and &s;tole a golden cup of ine&s;timable value. The hermit now concluded, that his companion was a Bad Angel. In travelling forward the next morning, they pa&s;&s;ed over a bridge; about the middle of which they met a poor man, of whom the angel a&s;ked the way to the next city. Having received the de&s;ired information, the angel pu&s;hed the poor man into the water, where he was immediately drowned. In the evening they arrived at the hou&s;e of a rich man; and begging for a lodging, were ordered to &s;leep in a &s;hed with the cattle. In the morning the angel gave the rich man the cup which he had &s;tolen. The hermit, amazed that the cup which was &s;tolen from their friend and bene|factor &s;hould be given to one who refu&s;ed them a lodging, began to be now convinced that his companion was the devil; and begged to go on alone. But the angel &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hear me, and depart. When you lived in your hermitage a &s;hepherd was killed by his ma&s;ter. He was innocent of the &s;uppo&s;ed offence: but had he not been then killed, he would have committed crimes in which he would have died impenitent. His ma&s;ter endeavours to atone for the murther, by dedicating the remainder of his days to alms and deeds of charity. I &s;trangled the child of the knight. But know, that the father was &s;o intent on heaping up riches for this child, as to ne|glect tho&s;e acts of public munificence for which he was be|fore &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, and to which he has now returned. I &s;tole the golden cup of the ho&s;pitable citizen. But know, that from a life of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tricte&s;t temperance, he became, in con&s;equence of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this cup, a perpetual drunkard; and is now the mo&s;t ab&s;temious of men. I threw the poor man into the water. He was then hone&s;t and religious. But know, had he walked one half of a mile further, he would
<PB N="xxx" REF="37">
have murthered a man in a &s;tate of mortal &s;in. I gave the golden cup to the rich man who refu&s;ed to take us within his roof. He has therefore received his reward in this world; and in the next, will &s;uffer the pains of hell for his inho&s;pi|tality."</Q> The hermit fell pro&s;trate at the angel's feet; and re|que&s;ting forgivene&s;s, returned to his hermitage, fully convinced of the wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice of God's government.</P>
<P>This is the fable of Parnell's HERMIT, which that elegant yet original writer has heightened with many ma&s;terly touches of poetical colouring, and a happier arrangement of circum|&s;tances. Among other proofs which might be mentioned of Parnell's genius and addre&s;s in treating this &s;ubject, by re&s;erving the di&s;covery of the angel to a critical period at the clo&s;e of the fable, he has found means to introduce a beautiful de&s;cription, and an intere&s;ting &s;urpri&s;e. In this poem, the la&s;t in&s;tance of the angel's &s;eeming inju&s;tice, is that of pu&s;hing the guide from the bridge into the river. At this, the hermit is unable to &s;uppre&s;s his indignation.</P>

CHAP. ci. Of Ganterus, who for his prowe&s;s in war being elected a king of a certain country, is on the night of his coro|nation conducted to a chamber, where at the head of the bed is a fierce lion, at the feet a dragon, and on either &s;ide a bear, toads, and &s;erpents. He immediately quitted his new kingdom; and was quickly elected king of another country. Going to re&s;t the fir&s;t night, he was led into a chamber furni&s;hed with a bed richly embroidered, but &s;tuck all over with &s;harp razors. This kingdom he al&s;o relinqui&s;hes. At length he meets a hermit, who gives him a &s;taff, with which he is directed to knock at the gate of a magnificent palace, &s;eated on a lofty mountain. Here he gains admittance, and finds every &s;ort of happine&s;s unembittered with the lae&s;t degree of pain.</P>

<P>In a more confined &s;en&s;e, the fir&s;t part of this apologue may be &s;eparately interpreted to &s;ignify, that a king, when he enters on his important charge, ought not to &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf to &s;ucceed to the privilege of an exemption from care, and to be put into immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the highe&s;t plea&s;ures, conveniencies, and felicities of life; but to be &s;en&s;ible, that from that moment, he begins to encounter the greate&s;t dangers and difficulties.</P>

But I believe the whole is nothing more than an oriental apologue on gratitude, written much earlier; and that it here exi&s;ts in its original &s;tate. Androclus's &s;tory is related by Aulus Gellius, on the authority of a Greek writer, one Ap|pion, called Pli&s;tonices, who flouri&s;hed under Tiberius. The cha|racter of Appion, with which Gellius prefaces this tale, in &s;ome mea&s;ure invalidates his credit; notwith&s;tanding he pretends to

But the two writers agree only in the general &s;ubject. Our compiler's narrative has much more &s;implicity than that of Gellius; and contains marks of ea&s;tern manners and life. Let me add, that the oriental fabuli&s;ts are fond of illu&s;trating and enforcing the duty of gratitude, by feigning in&s;tances of the gratitude of bea&s;ts towards men. And of this the pre&s;ent compilation, which is &s;trongly tinctured with orientali&s;m, affords &s;everal other proofs.</P>

The &s;erpent twi&s;ting her&s;elf round the rope, rang the bell for ju&s;tice; and by the emperor's &s;pecial command the toad was killed. A few days afterwards, as the king was repo&s;ing on his couch, the &s;erpent entered the chamber, bearing a precious &s;tone in her mouth. The &s;erpent creeping up to the emperor's face, laid the precious &s;tone on his eyes, and glided out of the apartment. Immediately the em|peror was re&s;tored to his &s;ight.</P>

<P>This &s;tory was originally invented of pope Gerbert, or Sylve&s;ter
<PB N="xlv" REF="52">
the &s;econd, who died in the year 1003. He was emi|nently learned in the mathematical &s;ciences, and on that ac|count was &s;tyled a magician. William of Malme&s;bury is, I believe, the fir&s;t writer now extant by whom it is recorded: and he produces it partly to &s;hew, that Gerbert was not always &s;ucce&s;sful in tho&s;e attempts which he &s;o frequently practi&s;ed to di&s;cover trea&s;ures hid in the earth, by the application of the ne|cromantic arts. I will tran&s;late Malme&s;bury's narration of this fable, as it varies in &s;ome of the circum&s;tances, and has &s;ome heightenings of the fiction. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"At Rome there was a brazen &s;tatue, extending the forefinger of the right hand; and on its forehead was written <HI>Strike here.</HI> Being &s;u&s;pected to conceal a trea&s;ure, it had received many brui&s;es from the credulous and ignorant, in their endeavours to open it. At length Gerbert unriddled the my&s;tery. At noon-day ob&s;erving the reflection of the forefinger on the ground, he marked the &s;pot. At night he came to the place, with a page carrying a lamp. There by a magical operation he opened a wide pa&s;&s;age in the earth; through which they both de&s;cended, and came to a va&s;t palace. The walls, the beams, and the whole &s;tructure, were of gold: they &s;aw golden images of knights playing at che&s;s, with a king and queen of gold at a banquet, with numerous attendants in gold, and cups of immen&s;e &s;ize and value. In a rece&s;s was a carbuncle, who&s;e lu&s;tre illuminated the whole palace: oppo&s;ite to which &s;tood a figure with a bended bow. As they attempted to touch &s;ome of the rich furniture, all the golden images &s;eemed to ru&s;h upon them. Gerbert was too wi&s;e to attempt this a &s;econd time: but the page was bold enough to &s;natch from the table a golden knife of ex|qui&s;ite workman&s;hip. At that moment, all the golden images ro&s;e up with a dreadful noi&s;e; the figure with the bow &s;hot at the carbuncle; and a total darkne&s;s en&s;ued. The page then replaced the knife, otherwi&s;e, they both would have &s;uffered a cruel death."</Q> Malme&s;bury afterwards mentions a brazen bridge, framed by the enchantments of Gerbert, beyond which
<PB N="xlvi" REF="53">
were golden hor&s;es of a gigantic &s;ize, with riders of gold richly illuminated by the mo&s;t &s;erene meridian &s;un. A large company attempt to pa&s;s the bridge, with a de&s;ign of &s;tealing &s;ome pieces of the gold. Immediately the bridge ro&s;e from its foundations, and &s;tood perpendicular on one end: a brazen man appeared from beneath it, who &s;truck the water with a mace of bra&s;s, and the &s;ky was over&s;pread with the mo&s;t horrible gloom. Gerbert, like &s;ome other learned necromancers of the Gothic ages, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have fabricated a brazen head under the influence of certain planets, which an&s;wered que&s;tions. But I forbear to &s;ugge&s;t any more hints for a future collection of Ara|bian tales. I &s;hall only add Malme&s;bury's account of the educa|tion of Gerbert, which is a curious illu&s;tration of what has been often inculcated in the&s;e volumes, concerning the introduc|tion of romantic fiction into Europe <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See DISS. i. And vol. i. 400. &s;eq.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Gerbert, a native of France, went into Spain for the purpo&s;e of learning a&s;trology, and other &s;ciences of that ca&s;t, of the Saracens; who, to this day, occupy the upper regions of Spain.

Here is a traite of the private life of our ance&s;tors, who wanted the diver|&s;ions and engagements of modern times to relieve a tedious even|ing. Hence we learn, that when a company was a&s;&s;embled, if a
<PB N="lxv" REF="72">
jugler or a min&s;trel were not pre&s;ent, it was their cu&s;tom to en|tertain them&s;elves by relating or hearing a &s;eries of adventures. Thus the general plan of the CANTERBURY TALES, which at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eems to be merely an ingenious invention of the poet to &s;erve a particular occa&s;ion, is in great mea&s;ure founded on a fa&s;hion of antient life: and Chaucer, in &s;uppo&s;ing each of the pilgrims to tell a tale as they are travelling to Becket's &s;hrine, only makes them adopt a mode of amu&s;ement which was com|mon to the conver&s;ations of his age. I do not deny, that Chaucer has &s;hewn his addre&s;s in the u&s;e and application of this practice.</P>
<P>So habitual was this amu&s;ement in the dark ages, that the graver &s;ort thought it un&s;afe for eccle&s;ia&s;tics, if the &s;ubjects ad|mitted any degree of levity.

<P>I take the liberty of introducing a &s;mall digre&s;&s;ion here, which refers to two pieces of the poet la&s;t-mentioned, never enume|rated among his works.

<P>Another piece probably written by Lydgate, yet never &s;up|po&s;ed or acknowledged to be of his compo&s;ition, is a poem in the octave &s;tanza, containing thirty-&s;even leaves in folio, and entitled LABEROUS AND MARVEYLOUS WORKE OF SAPIENCE. After a long debate between MERCY and TRUTH, and JUSTICE and PEACE, all the products of nature and of human know|ledge are de&s;cribed, as they &s;tand arranged in the palace and do|minions of WISDOM. It is generally allowed to have been printed by Caxton: it has not the name of the printer, nor any date. Had it been written by Caxton, as I once ha&s;tily &s;u&s;pected, or by any of his cotemporaries, the name of Lydgate would have appeared in conjunction with tho&s;e of Gower and Chaucer, who are highly celebrated in the Prologue as <HI>erthely gods expert in poe&s;ie:</HI> for the&s;e three writers were con&s;tantly joined in pane|gyric, at lea&s;t for a century, by their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, as the di&s;tin|gui&s;hed triumvirate of Engli&s;h poetry. In the &s;ame Prologue, the author &s;ays he was commanded to write this poem by the king. No poet cotemporary with Caxton was of con&s;equence enough to receive &s;uch a command: and we know that Lydgate compiled many of his works by the direction, or under the pa|tronage, of king Henry the fifth. Lydgate was born in Suffolk: and our author from the circum&s;tance of having lived in a part of England not of a very poli&s;hed dialect, apologi&s;es for the rude|ne&s;s of his language, &s;o that he cannot <HI>delycately endyte.</HI> It is much in the &s;tyle and manner of Lydgate: and I believe it to have been one of his early performances <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">See &s;upr. vol. ii. p. 194.

At parting &s;he gave him a ring; &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as often as you look on this ring, remember me."</Q> Soon after his departure &s;he had a &s;on. After various adventures, in which his friend Tirius has a &s;hare, at the end of &s;even years he returned to England in the habit of a pilgrim. Coming to his ca&s;tle, he &s;aw at the gate his lady &s;itting, and di&s;tributing alms to a croud of poor people; ordering them all to pray for the return of her lord Guido from the holy land. She was on that day accompanied by her &s;on a little boy, very beautiful, and richly apparelled; and who hearing his mother, as &s;he was di&s;tributing her alms, perpetually recommending Guido to their prayers, a&s;ked, if that was his father? Among others, &s;he gave alms to her hu&s;band Guido, not knowing him in the pilgrim's di&s;gui&s;e. Guido, &s;eeing the little boy, took him in his arms, and ki&s;&s;ed him: &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O my &s;weet &s;on, may God give you grace to plea&s;e him!"</Q> For this boldne&s;s he was reproved by the attendants. But the lady, finding him de&s;titute and a &s;tranger, a&s;&s;igned him a cottage in a neighbouring fore&s;t. Soon afterwards falling &s;ick, he &s;aid to his &s;ervant, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Carry this ring to your lady, and tell her, if &s;he de&s;ires ever to &s;ee me again, to come hither without delay."</Q> The &s;ervant conveyed the ring; but before &s;he arrived, he was dead. She threw her|&s;elf on his body, and exclaimed with tears, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Where are now my alms which I daily gave for my lord? I &s;aw you receive tho&s;e alms, but I knew you not.&mdash;You beheld, embraced, and ki&s;&s;ed your own &s;on, but did not di&s;cover your&s;elf to him nor to me. What have I done, that I &s;hall &s;ee you no more?"</Q> She then interred him magnificently.</P>

<P>Many romances were at fir&s;t little more than legends of devotion,
<PB N="lxxii" REF="79">
containing the pilgrimage of an old warrior. At length, as chivalry came more into vogue, and the &s;tores of invention were increa&s;ed, the youthful and active part of the pilgrim's life was al&s;o written, and a long &s;eries of imaginary martial adventures was added, in which his religious was eclip&s;ed by his heroic character, and the penitent was lo&s;t in the knight-errant. That which was the principal &s;ubject of the &s;hort and &s;imple legend, became only the remote cata&s;trophe of the voluminous romance. And hence by degrees it was almo&s;t an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule of every romance, for the knight to end his days in a hermitage. Cer|vantes has ridiculed this circum&s;tance with great plea&s;antry, where Don Quixote holds a grave debate with Sancho, whether he &s;hall turn &s;aint or archbi&s;hop.</P>
<P>So reciprocal, or rather &s;o convertible, was the pious and the military character, that even &s;ome of the apo&s;tles had their ro|mance. In the ninth century, the chivalrous and fabling &s;pirit of the Spaniards transformed &s;aint James into a knight. They pretended that he appeared and fought with irre&s;i&s;tible fury, completely armed, and mounted on a &s;tately white hor&s;e, in mo&s;t of their engagements with the Moors; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">cau&s;e, by his &s;uperior prowe&s;s in the&s;e bloody conflicts, he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have freed the Spaniards from paying the annual tribute of a hundred chri&s;tian virgins to their infidel enemies, they repre|&s;ented him as a profe&s;&s;ed and powerful champion of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed dam&s;els. This apotheo&s;is of chivalry in the per&s;on of their own apo&s;tle, mu&s;t have ever afterwards contributed to exaggerate the characteri&s;tical romantic heroi&s;m of the Spaniards, by which it was occa&s;ioned; and to propagate through &s;ucceeding ages, a &s;tronger veneration for that &s;pecies of military enthu&s;ia&s;m, to which they were naturally devoted. It is certain, that in con|&s;equence of the&s;e illu&s;trious achievements in the Moori&s;h wars, &s;aint James was con&s;tituted patron of Spain; and became the founder of one of the mo&s;t magnificent &s;hrines, and of the mo&s;t opulent order of knighthood, now exi&s;ting in chri&s;tendom.

In this age of curio&s;ity, di&s;tingui&s;hed for its love of hi&s;torical anecdotes and the inve&s;tigation of antient manners, it is extraor|dinary that a new tran&s;lation &s;hould not be made of Froi&s;&s;art from a collated and corrected original of the French. Froi&s;&s;art is commonly ranked with romances: but it ought to be remem|bered, that he is the hi&s;torian of a romantic age, when tho&s;e manners which form the fanta&s;tic books of chivalry were actually practi&s;ed. As he received his multifarious intelligence from &s;uch a variety of vouchers, and of different nations, and almo&s;t al|ways collected his knowledge of events from report, rather than from written or recorded evidence, his notices of per&s;ons and places are frequently confu&s;ed and unexact. Many of the&s;e petty incorrectne&s;&s;es are not, however, to be imputed to Froi&s;&s;art: and it may &s;eem &s;urpri&s;ing, that there are not more inaccuracies of this kind in a voluminous chronicle, treating of the affairs of England, and abounding in Engli&s;h appellations, compo&s;ed by a French|man, and printed in France. Whoever will take the pains to compare this author with the coeval records in Rymer, will find numerous in&s;tances of his truth and integrity, in relating the more public and important tran&s;actions of his own times. Why he &s;hould not have been honoured with a modern edition at the Louvre, it is ea&s;y to conceive: the French have a national prejudice again&s;t a writer, who has been &s;o much more com|plai&s;ant to England, than to their own country. Upon the whole, if Froi&s;&s;art &s;hould be neglected by the hi&s;torical reader for his want of preci&s;ion and authenticity, he will at lea&s;t be valued by the philo&s;opher for his &s;triking pictures of life, drawn without re&s;erve or affectation from real nature with a faithful and free pencil, and by one who had the be&s;t opportunities of ob&s;er|vation, who was welcome alike to the feudal ca&s;tle or the royal palace, and who mingled in the bu&s;tle and bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hat very curious period of &s;ociety, when manners are very far refined, and yet retain a con&s;iderable tincture of bar|bari&s;m.

In the famous ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE, written about the year 1310, the poet couches the difficulties of an ardent lover in attaining the object of his pa&s;&s;ion, under the allegory of a Ro&s;e, which is gathered in a delicious but almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible garden. The theologi&s;ts proved this ro&s;e to be the white ro&s;e of Jericho, the new Jeru&s;alem, a &s;tate of grace, di|vine wi&s;dom, the holy Virgin, or eternal beatitude, at none of which ob&s;tinate heretics can ever arrive. The chemi&s;ts pre|tended, that it was the philo&s;opher's &s;tone; the civilians, that it was the mo&s;t con&s;ummate point of equitable deci&s;ion; and the phy&s;icians, that it was an infallible panacea. In a word, other profe&s;&s;ions, in the mo&s;t elaborate commentaries, explained away the lover's ro&s;e into the my&s;teries of their own re&s;pective &s;cience. In conformity to this practice, Ta&s;&s;o allegori&s;ed his own poem: and a flim&s;y &s;tructure of morality was rai&s;ed on the chimerical conceptions of Ario&s;to's ORLANDO. In the year 1577, a tran&s;lation of a part of Amadis de Gaule appeared in France; with a learned preface, developing the valuable &s;tores of profound in&s;truction, concealed under the naked letter of the old romances, which were di&s;cernible only to the intelligent, and totally unperceived by common readers; who, in&s;tead of plucking the fruit, were obliged to re&s;t contented with <HI>le &s;imple</HI> FLEUR <HI>de la Lecture litterale.</HI> Even Spen&s;er, at a later period, could not indulge his native impul&s;e to de&s;criptions of chivalry, without framing &s;uch a &s;tory, as conveyed, under the <HI>dark con|ceit</HI> of ideal champions, a &s;et of hi&s;toric tran&s;actions, and an exemplification of the nature of the twelve moral virtues. He pre&s;ents his fanta&s;tic queen with a rich romantic mirrour, which &s;hewed the wonderous achievements of her magnificent ance&s;try.</P>

<P>It was not, however, &s;olely from an unmeaning and a wanton &s;pirit of refinement, that the fa&s;hion of re&s;olving every thing into allegory &s;o univer&s;ally prevailed. The &s;ame apology may be offered for the cabali&s;tical interpreters, both of the cla&s;&s;ics and of the old romances. The former not willing that tho&s;e books &s;hould be quite exploded which contained the antient mythology, laboured to reconcile the apparent ab&s;urdities of the pagan &s;y&s;tem to the chri&s;tian my&s;teries, by demon&s;trating a figurative re&s;emblance. The latter, as true learning began to dawn, with a view of &s;upporting for a while the expiring credit of giants and magicians, were compelled to palliate tho&s;e mon&s;trous incre|dibilities, by a bold attempt to unravel the my&s;tic web which had been wove by fairy hands, and by &s;hewing that truth was hid under the gorgeous veil of Gothic invention.</P>

<DIV1 N="19" TYPE="section">

<P>OUR communications and intercour&s;e with Italy, which began to prevail about the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, not only introduced the &s;tudies of cla&s;&s;ical lite|rature into England, but gave a new turn to our vernacular poetry. At this period, Petrarch &s;till continued the mo&s;t favo|rite poet of the Italians; and had e&s;tabli&s;hed a manner, which was univer&s;ally adopted and imitated by his ingenious countrymen. In the mean time, the courts both of France and England were di&s;tingui&s;hed for their elegance. Francis the fir&s;t had changed the &s;tate of letters in France, by mixing gallantry with learning, and by admitting the ladies to his court in company with the eccle&s;ia&s;tics <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See &s;upr. vol. ii. p. 414.</NOTE>. His carou&s;als were celebrated with a brilliancy and a fe&s;tivity unknown to the ceremonious &s;hews of former princes. Henry the eighth vied with Francis in the&s;e gaieties. His ambition, which could not bear a rival even in diver&s;ions,
<PB N="2" REF="106">
was &s;econded by liberality of di&s;po&s;ition and a love of o&s;tentation. For Henry, with many boi&s;terous qualities was magnificent and affable. Had he never murthered his wives, his politene&s;s to the fair &s;ex would remain unimpeached. His martial &s;ports were unincumbered by the barbaric pomp of the antient chivalry, and &s;oftened by the growing habits of more rational manners. He was attached to tho&s;e &s;pectacles and public amu&s;ements, in which beauty a&s;&s;umed a principal &s;hare; and his frequent ma&s;ques and tournaments encouraged a high &s;pirit of romantic courte&s;y. Poetry was the natural accompaniment of the&s;e re|finements. Henry him&s;elf was a leader and a chief character in the&s;e pageantries, and at the &s;ame time a reader and a writer of ver&s;es. The language and the manners of Italy were e&s;teemed and &s;tudied. The &s;onnets of Petrarch were the great models of compo&s;ition. They entered into the genius of the fa&s;hionable manners: and in a court of &s;uch a complexion, Pe|trach of cour&s;e became the popular poet. Henry Howard earl Surrey, with a mi&s;tre&s;s perhaps as beautiful as Laura, and at lea&s;t with Petrarch's pa&s;&s;ion if not his ta&s;te, led the way to great im|provements in Engli&s;h poetry, by a happy imitation of Petrarch, and other Italian poets, who had been mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in paint|ing the anxieties of love with pathos and propriety.</P>
<P>Lord Surrey's life throws &s;o much light on the character and &s;ubjects of his poetry, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to con&s;ider the one, without exhibiting a few anecdotes of the other. He was the &s;on and grand&s;on of two lords trea&s;urers dukes of Nor|folk; and in his early childhood di&s;covered the mo&s;t promi&s;ing marks of lively parts and an active mind.</P>
<P>While a boy, he was habituated to the modes of a court at Wind&s;or-ca&s;tle; where he re&s;ided, yet under the care of proper in&s;tructors, in the quality of a companion to Henry Fitzroy, duke of Richmond, a natural &s;on of king Henry the eighth, and of the highe&s;t expectations.</P>
<P>This young nobleman, who al&s;o bore other titles and honours, was the child of Henry's affection: not &s;o much on account of
<PB N="3" REF="107">
hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> hopeful abilities, as for a rea&s;on in&s;inuated by lord Herbert, and at which tho&s;e who know Henry's hi&s;tory and character will not be &s;urpri&s;ed, becau&s;e he equally and &s;trongly re&s;embled both his father and mother.</P>
<P>A friend&s;hip of the clo&s;e&s;t kind commencing between the&s;e two illu&s;trious youths, about the year 1530, they were both re|moved to cardinal Wol&s;ey's college at Oxford, then univer&s;ally frequented, as well for the excellence as the novelty of its in&s;ti|tution; for it was one of the fir&s;t &s;eminaries of an Engli&s;h uni|ver&s;ity, that profe&s;&s;ed to explode the pedantries of the old bar|barous philo&s;ophy, and to cultivate the graces of polite litera|ture. Two years afterwards, for the purpo&s;e of acquiring every accompli&s;hment of an elegant education, the earl accompanied his noble friend and fellow-pupil into France, where they re|ceived king Henry, on his arrival at Calais to vi&s;it Francis the fir&s;t, with a mo&s;t magnificent retinue. The frien&s;hip of the&s;e two young noblemen was &s;oon &s;trengthened by a new tie; for Richmond married the lady Mary Howard, Surrey's &s;i&s;ter. Rich|mond, however, appears to have died in the year 1536, about the age of &s;eventeen, having never cohabited with his wife <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Wood, ATH. OXON. i. 68.</NOTE>. It was long, before Surrey forgot the untimely lo&s;s of this amiable youth, the friend and a&s;&s;ociate of his childhood, and who nearly re&s;embled him&s;elf in genius, refinement of manners, and liberal acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>The FAIR GERALDINE, the general object of lord Surrey's pa&s;&s;ionate &s;onnets, is commonly &s;aid to have lived at Florence, and to have been of the family of the Gera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">i of that city. This is a mi&s;take, yet not entirely without grounds, propagated by an ea&s;y mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of an expre&s;&s;ion in one of our poet's odes, and a pa&s;&s;age in Drayton's heroic epi&s;tles. She was un|doubtedly one of the daughters of Gerald Fitzgerald, earl of Kildare. But it will be nece&s;&s;ary to tran&s;cribe what our author him&s;elf has &s;aid of this celebrated lady. The hi&s;tory of one

who cau&s;ed &s;o memorable and &s;o poetical a pa&s;&s;ion naturally ex|cites curio&s;ity, and will ju&s;tify an inve&s;tigation, which, on many a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, would properly be cen&s;ured as frivolous and impertinent.</P>

<P>The&s;e notices, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, are ob&s;cure and indirect. But a late elegant biographer has, with the mo&s;t happy &s;agacity, &s;olved the difficulties of this little enigmatical ode, which had been before either neglected and unattempted as inexplicable, or rendered<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> more unintelligible by fal&s;e conjectures. I readily adopt Mr. Walpole's key to the genealogy of the matchle&s;s Geraldine <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">CATAL. Roy. and Noble Authors, vol. i. p. 105. edit. 1759.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Her poetical appellation is almo&s;t her real name. Gerald Fitzgerald, abovementioned, earl of Kildare in the reign of Henry the eighth, married a &s;econd wife, Margaret daughter of Thomas Gray, marquis of Dor&s;et: by whom he had three daughters, Margaret, Eli&s;abeth, and Cicely. Margaret was born deaf and dumb; and a lady who could neither hear nor an&s;wer her lover, and who wanted the means of contributing to the mo&s;t endearing reciprocations, can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed to have
<PB N="5" REF="109">
been the cau&s;e of any vehement effu&s;ions of amorous panegyric. We may therefore &s;afely pronounce Eli&s;abeth or Cicely to have been Surrey's favorite. It was probably Eli&s;abeth, as &s;he &s;eems always to have lived in England.</P>
<P>Every circum&s;tance of the &s;onnet evidently coincides with this &s;tate of the ca&s;e. But, to begin with the fir&s;t line, it will naturally be a&s;ked, what was lady Eli&s;abeth Gerald's connection with Tu&s;cany? The beginnings of noble families, like tho&s;e of nations, often owe &s;omewhat to fictitious embelli&s;hment: and our genealogi&s;ts uniformly a&s;&s;ert, that the family of Fitzgerald derives its origin from Otho, a de&s;cendant of the dukes of Tu&s;cany: that they migrated into England under the reign of king Alfred, who&s;e annals are luckily too &s;canty to contradict &s;uch an account, and were from England &s;peedily tran&s;planted into Ireland. Her father was an Iri&s;h earl, re&s;ident at his earl|dom of Kildare; and &s;he was con&s;equently born and nur&s;ed in Ireland. Her mother, adds the &s;onnet, was of princely paren|tage. Here is a no le&s;s exact corre&s;pondence with the line of the lady's pedigree: for Thomas, marquis of Dor&s;et, was &s;on of queen Eli&s;abeth Gray, daughter of the duche&s;s of Bedford, de|&s;cended from the royal hou&s;e of Luxemburgh. The poet ac|quaints us, that he fir&s;t &s;aw her at Hun&s;don. This notice, which &s;eems of an indifferent nature and quite extraneous to the que&s;|tion, abundantly corroborates our conjecture. Hund&s;don-hou&s;e in Hertford&s;hire was a new palace built by Henry the eighth, and chiefly for the purpo&s;e of educating his children. The lady Eli&s;abeth Fitzgerald was &s;econd cou&s;in to Henry's daughters the prince&s;&s;es Mary and Eli&s;abeth, who were both educated at Hun&s;|don <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Strype, ECCL. MEM. vol. i. APPEND. Numb. 71.</NOTE>. At this royal nur&s;ery &s;he therefore <HI>ta&s;ted of co&s;tly foode with kinges childe,</HI> that is, lived while a girl with the young prince&s;&s;es her relations, as a companion in their education. At the &s;ame time, and on the &s;ame plan, our earl of Surrey re&s;ided at Wind&s;or-ca&s;tle, as I have already remarked, with the young
<PB N="6" REF="110">
duke of Richmond. It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that he &s;ometimes vi&s;ited the prince&s;&s;es at Hun&s;don, in company with the young duke their brother, where he mu&s;t have al&s;o &s;een the fair Geral|dine: yet by the nature of his &s;ituation at Wind&s;or, which im|plied a degree of confinement, he was hindered from vi&s;iting her at Hun&s;don &s;o often as he wi&s;hed. He therefore pathetically laments,
<Q><L>Wind&s;or, alas, doth cha&s;e me from her &s;ight!</L></Q>
But although the earl fir&s;t beheld this lady at the palace of Hun&s;|don, yet, as we further learn from the &s;onnet, he was fir&s;t &s;truck with her incomparable beauty, and his pa&s;&s;ion com|menced, at Hampton-court.
<Q><L>Hampton me taught to wi&s;h her fir&s;t for mine!</L></Q>
That is, and perhaps on occa&s;ion of &s;ome &s;plendid ma&s;que or carou|&s;al, when the lady Eli&s;abeth Fitzgerald, with the prince&s;&s;es Mary and Eli&s;abeth, and their brother Richmond, with the young lord Surrey, were invited by the king to Hampton-court.</P>
<P>In the mean time we mu&s;t remember, that the lord Leonard Gray, uncle to lord Gerald Fitzgerald, was deputy of Ireland for the young duke of Richmond: a connection, exclu&s;ive of all that has been &s;aid, which would alone account for Surrey's acquaintance at lea&s;t with this lady. It is al&s;o a rea&s;on, to &s;ay no more, why the earl &s;hould have regarded her from the fir&s;t with a particular attention, which afterwards grew into the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate attachment. She is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been Maid of honour to queen Catharine. But there are three of Henry's queens of that name. For obvious rea&s;ons, however, we may venture to &s;ay, that queen Catharine Howard was Geraldine's queen.</P>
<P>It is not preci&s;ely known at what period the earl of Surrey began his travels. They have the air of a romance. He made the tour of Europe in the true &s;pirit of chivalry, and with the
<PB N="7" REF="111">
ideas of an Amadis; proclaiming the unparalleled charms of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and prepared to defend the cau&s;e of her beauty with the weapons of knight-errantry. Nor was this adventurous journey performed without the intervention of an enchanter. The fir&s;t city in Italy which he propo&s;ed to vi&s;it was Florence, the capital of Tu&s;cany, and the original &s;eat of the ance&s;tors of his Geraldine. In his way thither, he pa&s;&s;ed a few days at the emperor's court; where he became acquainted with Cornelius Agrippa, a celebrated adept in natural magic. This vi&s;ionary philo&s;opher &s;hewed our hero, in a mirror of gla&s;s, a living image of Geraldine, reclining on a couch, &s;ick, and reading one of his mo&s;t tender &s;onnets by a waxen taper <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Drayton, HER. EPIST.&mdash;HOWARD to GERALDINE, v. 57.</NOTE>. His imagination, which wanted not the flattering repre&s;entations and artificial in|centives of illu&s;ion, was heated anew by this intere&s;ting and af|fecting &s;pectacle. Inflamed with every enthu&s;ia&s;m of the mo&s;t romantic pa&s;&s;ion, he ha&s;tened to Florence: and, on his arrival, immediately publi&s;hed a defiance again&s;t any per&s;on who could handle a lance and was in love, whether Chri&s;tian, Jew, Turk, Saracen, or Canibal, who &s;hould pre&s;ume to di&s;pute the &s;uperio|rity of Geraldine's beauty. As the lady was pretended to be of Tu&s;can extraction, the pride of the Florentines was flattered on this occa&s;ion: and the grand duke of Tu&s;cany permitted a ge|neral and unmole&s;ted ingre&s;s into his dominions of the comba|tants of all countries, till this important trial &s;hould be decided. The challenge was accepted, and the earl victorious <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Wood, ubi &s;upr.</NOTE>.

<P>The&s;e heroic vanities did not, however, &s;o totally engro&s;s the time which Surrey &s;pent in Italy, as to alienate his mind from letters: he &s;tudied with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s a critical knowledge
<PB N="8" REF="112">
of the Italian tongue, and, that he might give new lu&s;tre to the name of Geraldine, attained a ju&s;t ta&s;te for the peculiar graces of the Italian poetry.</P>
<P>He was recalled to England for &s;ome idle rea&s;on by the king, much &s;ooner than he expected: and he returned home, the mo&s;t elegant traveller, the mo&s;t polite lover, the mo&s;t learned nobleman, and the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed gentleman, of his age. Dexterity in tilting, and gracefulne&s;s in managing a hor&s;e under arms, were excellencies now viewed with a critical eye, and practi&s;ed with a high degree of emulation. In 1540, at a tour|nament held in the pre&s;ence of the court at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and in which the principal of the nobility were engaged, Surrey was di&s;tingui&s;hed above the re&s;t for his addre&s;s in the u&s;e and exerci&s;e of arms. But his martial &s;kill was not &s;olely di&s;played in the parade and o&s;tentation of the&s;e dome&s;tic combats. In 1542, he marched into Scotland, as a chief commander in his father's army; and was con&s;picuous for his conduct and bravery at the memorable battle of Flodden-field, where James the fourth of Scotland was killed. The next year, we find the career of his victories impeded by an ob&s;tacle which no valour could re&s;i&s;t. The cen&s;ures of the church have humiliated the greate&s;t heroes: and he was impri&s;oned in Wind&s;or-ca&s;tle for eating fle&s;h in Lent. The prohibition had been renewed or &s;trengthened by a recent proclamation of the king. I mention this circum&s;tance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> not only as it marks his character, impatient of any controul, and carele&s;s of very &s;erious con&s;equences which often ari&s;e from a contempt of petty formalities, but as it gave occa&s;ion to one of his mo&s;t &s;entimental and pathetic &s;onnets <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Fol. 6. 7.</NOTE>. In 1544, he was field-mar&s;hal of the Engli&s;h army in the expedition to Bologne, which he took.

<P><PB N="9" REF="113">
But as Surrey's popularity encrea&s;ed, his intere&s;t declined with the king; who&s;e caprices and jealou&s;ies grew more violent with his years and infirmities. The brilliancy of Surrey's character, his celebrity in the military &s;cience, his general abilities, his wit, learning, and affability, were viewed by Henry with di&s;|gu&s;t and &s;u&s;picion. It was in vain that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every advan|tageous qualification, which could adorn the &s;cholar, the cour|tier, and the &s;oldier. In proportion as he was amiable in the eyes of the people, he became formidable to the king. His ri&s;ing reputation was mi&s;con&s;trued into a dangerous ambition, and gave birth to accu&s;ations equally groundle&s;s and frivolous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> He was &s;u&s;pected of a de&s;ign to marry the prince&s;s Mary; and, by that alliance, of approaching to a po&s;&s;ibility of wearing the crown.

<P>The addition of the e&s;cocheon of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or to his own, although u&s;ed by the family of Norfolk for many years, and ju&s;tified by the authority of the heralds, was a &s;uffi|cient foundation for an impeachment of high trea&s;on. The&s;e motives were privately aggravated by tho&s;e prejudices, with which Henry remembered the mi&s;behaviour of Catharine Howard, and which were extended to all that lady's relations. At length, the earl of Surrey fell a &s;acrifice to the peevi&s;h inju&s;tice of a merci|le&s;s and ungrateful ma&s;ter. Notwith&s;tanding his eloquent and ma&s;culine defence, which even in the cau&s;e of guilt it&s;elf would have proved a powerful per&s;ua&s;ive, he was condemned by the prepared &s;uffrage of a &s;ervile and ob&s;equious jury, and beheaded on Tower-hill in the year 1547 <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">See Stowe, CHRON<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> p. 592.

In the mean time we &s;hould remember, that Surrey's public conduct was not on all occa&s;ions quite unexceptionable. In the affair of Bologne he had made a fal&s;e &s;tep. This had offended the king. But Henry, when once offended, could never forgive. And when Hertford was &s;ent into France to take the command, he could not refrain from
<PB N="10" REF="114">
dropping &s;ome reproachful expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t a mea&s;ure which &s;eemed to impeach his per&s;onal courage. Con&s;cious of his high birth and capacity, he was above the little attentions of caution and re&s;erve; and he too frequently neglected to con&s;ult his own &s;ituation, and the king's temper. It was his misfortune to &s;erve a monarch, who&s;e re&s;entments, which were ea&s;ily provoked, could only be &s;atisfied by the mo&s;t &s;evere revenge. Henry brought tho&s;e men to the block, which other monarchs would have only di&s;graced.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e anecdotes of Surrey's life, I had almo&s;t forgot to mention what became of his amour with the fair Geraldine. We lament to find, that Surrey's devotion to this lady did not end in a wedding, and that all his gallantries and ver&s;es availed &s;o little! No memoirs of that incurious age have informed us, whether her beauty was equalled by her cruelty; or whether her ambition prevailed &s;o far over her gratitude, as to tempt her to prefer the &s;olid glories of a more &s;plendid title and ample for|tune, to the challenges and the compliments, of &s;o magnani|mous, &s;o faithful, and &s;o eloquent a lover. She appears, however, to have been afterwards the third wife of Edward Clinton, earl of Lincoln. Such al&s;o is the power of time and accident over amorous vows, that even Surrey him&s;elf outlived the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion. He married Frances, daughter of John earl of Oxford, by whom he left &s;everal children. One of his daugh|ters, Jane counte&s;s of We&s;tmoreland, was among the learned ladies of that age, and became famous for her knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Dugd.

<P>Our authors SONGES AND SONNETTES, as they have been &s;tiled, were fir&s;t collected and printed at London by Tottell,

in 1557 <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">In quarto. It is extraordinary, that A. Wood &s;hould not have known this edi|tion. Another edition appeared in 1565. Others, in 1574.&mdash;1585.&mdash;1587.&mdash;Others appeared afterwards.</NOTE>. As it happens in collections of this kind, they are of various merit. Surrey is &s;aid, by the ingenious author of the MUSES LIBRARY, to have been the fir&s;t who broke through the fa&s;hion of &s;tanzas, and wrote in the heroic couplet. But all Surrey's poems are in the alternate rhyme; nor, had this been true, is the other po&s;ition to be granted. Chaucer's Prologues and mo&s;t of the Canterbury Tales are written in long ver&s;e: nor was the u&s;e of the couplet re&s;umed, till late in the reign of Eli&s;abeth.</P>
<P>In the &s;onnets of Surrey, we are &s;urpri&s;ed to find nothing of that metaphy&s;ical ca&s;t which marks the Italian poets, his &s;up|po&s;ed ma&s;ters, e&s;pecially Petrarch. Surrey's &s;entiments are for the mo&s;t part natural and unaffected; ari&s;ing from his own feel|ings, and dictated by the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances. His poetry is alike unembarra&s;&s;ed by learned allu&s;ions, or elaborate conceits. If our author copies Petrarch, it is Petrarch's better manner: when he de&s;cends from his Platonic ab&s;tractions, his refinements of pa&s;&s;ion, his exaggerated compliments, and his play upon oppo|&s;ite &s;entiments, into a track of tenderne&s;s, &s;implicity, and nature. Petrarch would have been a better poet had he been a wor&s;e &s;cho|lar. Our author's mind was not too much overlaid by learning.</P>
<P>The following is the poem abovementioned, in which he laments his impri&s;onment in Wind&s;or-ca&s;tle. But it is rather an elegy than a &s;onnet.</P>

<P>In the poet's &s;ituation, nothing can be more natural and &s;triking than the reflection with which he opens his complaint. There is al&s;o much beauty in the abruptne&s;s of his exordial exclamation. The &s;uperb palace, where he had pa&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t plea&s;ing days of his youth with the &s;on of a king, was now con|verted into a tedious and &s;olitary pri&s;on! This unexpected vici&s;|&s;itude of fortune awakens a new and intere&s;ting train of thought. The compari&s;on of his pa&s;t and pre&s;ent circum&s;tances recals their juvenile &s;ports and amu&s;ements; which were more to be regretted, as young Richmond was now dead. Having de&s;cribed &s;ome of the&s;e with great elegance, he recurs to his fir&s;t idea by a beautiful apo&s;trophe. He appeals to the place of his confine|ment, once the &s;ource of his highe&s;t plea&s;ures: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O place of bli&s;s, renewer of my woe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">!

inhabitant! Echo alone either pities or an&s;wers my que&s;tion, and returns a plaintive hollow &s;ound!"</Q> He clo&s;es his com|plaint with an affecting and pathetic &s;entiment, much in the &s;tyle of Petrarch. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To bani&s;h the mi&s;eries of my pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, I am forced on the wretched expedient of remem|bering a greater!"</Q> This is the con&s;olation of a warm fancy.

<P>But Surrey was not merely the poet of idlene&s;s and gallantry. He was fitted both from nature and &s;tudy, for the more &s;olid and laborious parts of literature. He tran&s;lated the &s;econd and fourth books of Virgil into blank ver&s;e <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">They were fir&s;t printed in 1557. 12mo.</NOTE>: and it &s;eems probable, that

his active &s;ituations of life prevented him from completing a de&s;ign of tran&s;lating the whole Eneid.</P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t compo&s;ition in blank ver&s;e, extant in the Engli&s;h language. Nor has it merely the relative and accidental merit of being a curio&s;ity. It is executed with great fidelity, yet not with a pro&s;aic &s;ervility. The diction is often poetical, and the ver&s;ification varied with proper pau&s;es.

<P>This was a noble attempt to break the bondage of rhyme. But blank ver&s;e was now growing fa&s;hionable in the Italian poetry, the &s;chool of Surrey. Felice Figlinei, a Sane&s;e, and Surrey's cotemporary, in his admirable Italian commentary on the ETHICS of Ari&s;totle, entitled FILOSOSIA MORALE SOPRA IL LIBRI D' ETHICA D'ARISTOTILE, declaims again&s;t the barbarity of rhyme, and &s;trongly recommends a total rejection of this Gothic ornament to his countrymen. He enforces his precept by his own example; and tran&s;lates all Ari&s;totle's quotations from Homer and Euripides into ver&s;e without rhyme. Gon&s;alvo Perez, the learned &s;ecretary to Philip of Spain, had al&s;o recently tran|&s;lated Homer's Ody&s;&s;ey into Spani&s;h blank-ver&s;e. How much the excellent Roger A&s;cham approved of Surrey's di&s;u&s;e of rhyme in this tran&s;lation from Virgil, appears from the following pa&s;|&s;age in his SCHOLEMASTER, written about the year 1566 <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">I know of no Engli&s;h critic be&s;ides, who has mentioned Surrey's Virgil, except Bolton, a great reader of old Engli&s;h books.

<P>The revival of the Greek and Roman poets in Italy, excited all the learned men of that country to copy the Roman ver&s;ifica|tion, and con&s;equently bani&s;hed the old Leonine Latin ver&s;e. The &s;ame cla&s;&s;ical idea operated in &s;ome degree on the vernacular poetry of Italy. In the year 1528, Tri&s;&s;ino publi&s;hed his ITA|LIA LIBERATA DI GOTI, or, ITALY DELIVERED FROM THE GOTHS, an heroic poem, profe&s;&s;edly written in imitation of the Iliad, without either rhyme, or the u&s;ual machineries of the Gothic romance. Tri&s;&s;ino's de&s;ign was to de&s;troy the TERZA RIMA of Dante. We do not, however, find, whether it be from the facility with which the Italian tongue falls into rhyme, or that the be&s;t and e&s;tabli&s;hed Italian poets wrote in the &s;tanza, that the&s;e efforts to re&s;tore blank-ver&s;e, produced any la&s;ting effects in the progre&s;s of the Italian poetry. It is very probable, that this &s;pecimen of the Eneid in blank-ver&s;e by Surrey, led the way to Abraham Fleming's blank-ver&s;e tran&s;lation of Virgil's Bucolics and Georgics, although done in Alexandrines, publi&s;hed in the year 1589 <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">London, 4to.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Lord Surrey wrote many other Engli&s;h poems which were never
<PB N="26" REF="130">
publi&s;hed, and are now perhaps entirely lo&s;t. He tran&s;lated the ECCLESIASTES of Solomon into Engli&s;h ver&s;e. This piece is cited in the Preface to the Tran&s;lation of the P&s;alms, printed at London in 1567. He al&s;o tran&s;lated a few of the P&s;alms into metre. The&s;e ver&s;ions of Scripture &s;hew that he was a friend to the refor|mation. Among his works are al&s;o recited, a Poem on his friend the young duke of Richmond, an Exhortation to the citizens of London, a Tran&s;lation of Boccace's Epi&s;tle to Pinus, and a &s;ett of Latin epi&s;tles. Aubrey has pre&s;erved a poetical Epitaph, written by Surrey on &s;ir Thomas Clere, his faithful retainer and con&s;tant attendant, which was once in Lambeth-church <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">See Aubrey's SURREY, V. 247.</NOTE>; and which, for its affection and elegance, de&s;erves to be printed among the earl's poems.

<P>WITH Surrey's Poems, Tottel has joined, in his editions of 1557 and 1565, the SONGES and SONNETTES of &s;ir Thomas Wyat the elder <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Wyat's begin at fol. 19.</NOTE>, and of Uncertain Auctours.</P>
<P>Wyat was of Allington-ca&s;tle in Kent, which he magnificently repaired, and educated in both our univer&s;ities. But his chief and mo&s;t &s;plendid accompli&s;hments were derived from his travels into various parts of Europe, which he frequently vi&s;ited in the quality of an envoy. He was endeared to king Henry the eighth, who did not always act from caprice, for his fidelity and &s;ucce&s;s in the execution of public bu&s;ine&s;s, his &s;kill in arms, literature, familiarity with languages, and lively conver&s;ation. Wood, who degrades every thing by poverty of &s;tyle and improper repre&s;en|tations, &s;ays, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the king was in a high manner delighted with his <HI>witty je&s;ts</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">ATH. OXON. i. 51.</NOTE>."</Q> It is not perhaps improbable, that Henry was as much plea&s;ed with his repartees as his politics. He is re|ported to have occa&s;ioned the reformation by a joke, and to have planned the fall of cardinal Wol&s;ey by a &s;ea&s;onable &s;tory <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e MISCELLANEOUS ANTIQUITIES. Numb. ii. pag. 16. Printed at Strawberry|hill, 1772. 4to.</NOTE>. But he had almo&s;t lo&s;t his popularity, either from an intimacy with queen Anne Boleyn, which was called a connection, or the gloomy cabals of bi&s;hop Bonner, who could not bear his poli|tical &s;uperiority. Yet his prudence and integrity, no le&s;s than the powers of his oratory, ju&s;tified his innocence. He laments his &s;evere and unju&s;t impri&s;onment on that trying occa&s;ion, in a &s;onnet addre&s;&s;ed to &s;ir Francis Bryan: in&s;inuating his &s;ollici|tude, that although the wound would be healed, the &s;car would

remain, and that to be acquitted of the accu&s;ation would avail but little, while the thoughts of having been accu&s;ed were &s;till fre&s;h in remembrance <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fol. 44.</NOTE>. It is a common mi&s;take, that he died abroad of the plague in an emba&s;&s;y to Charles the fifth. Being &s;ent to conduct that emperor's emba&s;&s;ador from Falmouth to London, from too eager and a needle&s;s de&s;ire of executing his commi&s;&s;ion with di&s;patch and punctuality, he caught a fever by riding in a hot day, and in his return died on the road at Shir|burn, where he was buried in the great conventual church, in the year 1541. The next year, Leland publi&s;hed a book of Latin ver&s;es on his death, with a wooden print of his head pre|fixed, probably done by Holbein <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">NAEN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">AE <HI>in mortem T.

It will be &s;uperfluous to tran&s;cribe the panegyrics of his cotemporaries, after the enco|mium of lord Surrey, in which his amiable character owes more to truth, than to the graces of poetry, or to the flattery of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t agree with a critic above quoted, that Wyat co|operated with Surry, in having corrected the roughne&s;s of our poetic &s;tyle. But Wyat, although &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed from the common ver&s;ifiers of his age, is confe&s;&s;edly inferior to Surrey in harmony of numbers, per&s;picuity of expre&s;&s;ion, and facility of phra&s;eology. Nor is he equal to Surrey in elegance of &s;enti|timent, in nature and &s;en&s;ibility. His feelings are di&s;gui&s;ed by affectation, and ob&s;cured by conceit. His declarations of pa&s;&s;ion are embarra&s;&s;ed by wit and fancy; and his &s;tyle is not intelli|gible, in proportion as it is carele&s;s and unadorned. His compli|ments, like the modes of behaviour in that age, are ceremonious and &s;trained. He has too much art as a lover, and too little as a poet. His gallantries are laboured, and his ver&s;ification negli|gent. The truth is, his genius was of the moral and didactic &s;pecies: and his poems abound more in good &s;en&s;e, &s;atire, and ob&s;ervations on life, than in pathos or imagination. Yet there

<P>Our author has more imitations, and even tran&s;lations, from the Italian poets than Surrey: and he &s;eems to have been more fond of their conceits. Petrarch has de&s;cribed the perplexities of a lover's mind, and his &s;truggles betwixt hope and de&s;pair, a &s;ubject mo&s;t fertile of &s;entimental complaint, by a combination of contrarieties, a &s;pecies of wit highly reli&s;hed by the Italians. I am, &s;ays he, neither at peace nor war. I burn, and I freeze. I &s;oar to heaven, and yet grovel on the earth. I can hold no|thing, and yet gra&s;p every thing. My pri&s;on is neither &s;hut, nor is it opened. I &s;ee without eyes, and I complain without a voice. I laugh, and I weep. I live, and am dead.

<P>It was from the capricious and over-&s;trained invention of the Italian poets, that Wyat was taught to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">orture the pa&s;&s;ion of love by prolix and intricate compari&s;ons, and unnatural allu&s;ions. At one time his love is a galley &s;teered by cruelty through &s;tormy &s;eas and dangerous rocks; the &s;ails torn by the bla&s;t of tem|pe&s;tuous &s;ighs, and the cordage con&s;umed by ince&s;&s;ant &s;howers of tears: a cloud of grief envelopes the &s;tars<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> rea&s;on is drowned,

and the haven is at a di&s;tance <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Fol. 22.</NOTE>. At another <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fol. 25.</NOTE>, it is a &s;pring trickling from the &s;ummit of the Alps, which gathering force in its fall, at length overflows all the plain beneath <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Fol. 25.</NOTE>. Some|times, it is a gun, which being overcharged, expands the flame within it&s;elf, and bur&s;ts in pieces <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Fol. 29.</NOTE>. Sometimes it is like a pro|digious mountain, which is perpetually weeping in copious foun|tains, and &s;ending forth &s;ighs from its fore&s;ts: which bears more leaves than fruits: which breeds wild-bea&s;ts, the proper em|blems of rage, and harbours birds that are always &s;inging <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Fol. 36.</NOTE>. In another of his &s;onnets, he &s;ays, that all nature &s;ympathi&s;es with his pa&s;&s;ion. The woods re&s;ound his elegies, the rivers &s;top their cour&s;e to hear him complain, and the gra&s;s weeps in dew. The&s;e thoughts are common and fanta&s;tic. But he adds an image which is new, and has much nature and &s;entiment, al|though not well expre&s;&s;ed.
<Q><L>The hugy okes have rored in the winde,</L>
<L>Eche thing, methought, complaining in theyr kinde.</L></Q>

But &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e are not the general characteri&s;tics of Wyat's poetry. They &s;trike us but &s;eldom, amid&s;t an impracticable
<PB N="34" REF="138">
ma&s;s of forced reflections, hyperbolical metaphors, and complaints that move no compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But Wyat appears a much more plea&s;ing writer, when he morali&s;es on the felicities of retirement, and attacks the vanities and vices of a court, with the hone&s;t indignation of an inde|pendent philo&s;opher, and the freedom and plea&s;antry of Horace. Three of his poetical epi&s;tles are profe&s;&s;edly written in this &s;train, two to John Poines <NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">He &s;eems to have been a per&s;on about the court. See LIFE of Sir Thomas Pope, p. 46.</NOTE>, and the other to &s;ir Francis Bryan: and we mu&s;t regret, that he has not left more pieces in a &s;tyle of compo&s;ition for which he &s;eems to have been eminently qua|lified. In one of the epi&s;tles to Poines on the life of a cour|tier, are the&s;e &s;pirited and manly reflections.</P>

<P>In pur&s;uit of this argument, he declares his indi&s;po&s;ition and inability to di&s;gui&s;e the truth, and to flatter, by a variety of in&s;tances.

<P>Among Wyat's poems is an unfini&s;hed tran&s;lation, in Alexan|drine ver&s;e, of the Song of Iopas in the fir&s;t book of Virgil's Eneid <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Fol. 49.</NOTE>. Wyat's and Surrey's ver&s;ions from Virgil are the fir&s;t

regular tran&s;lations in Engli&s;h of an antient cla&s;&s;ic poet: and they are &s;ymptoms of the re&s;toration of the &s;tudy of the Roman writers, and of the revival of elegant literature. A ver&s;ion of David's P&s;alms by Wyat is highly extolled by lord Surrey and Leland.

But they belong to an elegant little ode of ten &s;tanzas in the col|lection before us, in which a lover complains that he is caught by the &s;nare which he once defied <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Fol. 53.</NOTE>. The unfortunate queen only quoted a di&s;tich applicable to her &s;ituation, which &s;he re|membered in a fa&s;hionable &s;ett of poems, perhaps the amu&s;ement of her youth.</P>
<P>The ode, which is the compari&s;on of the author's <HI>faithful and painful</HI> pa&s;&s;ion with that of Troilus <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Fol. 81.</NOTE>, is founded on Chaucer's

poem, or Boccace's, on the &s;ame &s;ubject. This was the mo&s;t favorite love-&s;tory of our old poetry, and from its popularity was wrought into a drama by Shake&s;peare. Troilus's &s;ufferings for Cre&s;&s;ida were a common topic for a lover's fidelity and a&s;&s;i|duity. Shake&s;peare, in his MERCHANT OF VENICE, compares a night favorable to the &s;tratagems or the meditation of a lover, to &s;uch a night as Troilus might have cho&s;en, for &s;tealing a view of the Grecian camp from the ramparts of Troy.</P>

This is the fir&s;t attempt at a metrical tran&s;lation of any part of Ovid into Engli&s;h, for Caxton's Ovid is a loo&s;e paraphra&s;e in pro&s;e. Nor were the heroic epi&s;tles of Ovid tran&s;lated into ver&s;e till the year 1582, by George Tuberville. It is a proof that the cla&s;&s;ics were &s;tudied, when they began to be tran&s;lated.</P>
<P>It would be tedious and intricate to trace the particular imita|tions of the Italian poets, with which the&s;e anonymous poems abound. Two of the &s;onnets<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fol. 74.</NOTE> are panegyrics on Petrarch and Laura, names at that time familiar to every polite reader, and the patterns of poetry and beauty. The &s;onnet on <HI>The diver&s;e and contrarie pa&s;&s;ions of the lover</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fol. 107.</NOTE>, is formed on one of Petrarch's &s;onnets, and which, as I have remarked before, was tran&s;lated by &s;ir Thomas Wyat <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Supr. p. 31.</NOTE>. So many of the nobility, and principal per&s;ons about the court, writing &s;onnets in the Italian &s;tyle, is a circum&s;tance which mu&s;t have greatly contributed to circulate this mode of compo&s;ition, and to encourage the &s;tudy of the Italian poets.

He tran&s;lated from the Spani&s;h, by de&s;ire of the lady of &s;ir Nicholas Carew, THE CASTLE OF LOVE.

<P>I have a &s;u&s;picion, that the&s;e two pieces in blank-ver&s;e, if not fragments of larger works, were fini&s;hed in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, as prolu&s;ions, or illu&s;trative practical &s;pecimens, for our author's cour&s;e of lectures in rhetoric.

<P>I have already mentioned lord Surrey's Virgil: and for the &s;ake of juxtapo&s;ition, will here produce a third &s;pecimen of early blank-ver&s;e, little known. In the year 1590, William Vallans publi&s;hed a blank-ver&s;e poem, entitled, A TALE OF TWO SWANNES, which, under a poetic fiction, de&s;cribes the &s;ituation and antiquities of &s;everal towns in Hertford&s;hire.

written for the &s;tage. Long before Vallans's TWO SWANNES, many theatrical pieces in blank-ver&s;e had appeared; the fir&s;t of which is, The TRAGEDY OF GORDOBUCKE, written in 1561. The &s;econd is George Ga&s;coigne's JOCASTA, a tragedy, acted at Grays-inn, in 1566. George Peele had al&s;o publi&s;hed his tragedy in blank-ver&s;e of DAVID and BETHSABE, about the year 1579 <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Shake&s;peare did not begin writing for the &s;tage till 1591.

But this point, which is here only tran|&s;iently mentioned, will be more fully con&s;idered hereafter, in its proper place. We will now return to our author Grimoald.</P>
<P>Grimoald, as a writer of ver&s;es in rhyme, yields to none of his cotemporaries, for a ma&s;terly choice of cha&s;te expre&s;&s;ion, and the conci&s;e elegancies of didactic ver&s;ification. Some of the couplets, in his poem IN PRAISE OF MODERATION, have all the &s;martne&s;s which marks the modern &s;tyle of &s;ententious poetry, and would have done honour to Pope's ethic epi&s;tles.</P>

<P>IT will not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that all the poets of the reign of Henry the eighth were educated in the &s;chool of Petrarch. The graces of the Italian mu&s;e, which had been taught by Surrey and Wyat, were confined to a few. Nor were the beau|ties of the cla&s;&s;ics yet become general objects of imitation. There are many writers of this period who &s;till rhymed on, in the old pro&s;aic track of their immediate predece&s;&s;ors, and never ventured to deviate into the modern improvements. The &s;train of romantic fiction was lo&s;t; in the place of which, they did not &s;ub&s;titute the elegancies newly introduced.</P>
<P>I &s;hall con&s;ider together, yet without an exact ob&s;ervation of chronological order, the poets of the reign of Henry the eighth who form this &s;ubordinate cla&s;s, and who do not bear any mark of the character of the poetry which di&s;tingui&s;hes this period.

<P>JOHN HEYWOOD, commonly called the epigrammati&s;t, was beloved and rewarded by Henry the eighth for his buffoone|ries. At leaving the univer&s;ity, he commenced author, and was countenanced by &s;ir Thomas More for his facetious di&s;po&s;ition. To his talents of jocularity in conver&s;ation, he joined a &s;kill in mu&s;ic, both vocal and in&s;trumental. His merriments were &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible, that they moved even the rigid mu&s;cles of queen Mary; and her &s;ullen &s;olemnity was not proof again&s;t his &s;ongs, his rhymes, and his je&s;ts.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding his profe&s;&s;ional di&s;&s;ipation, Heywood appears to have lived comfortably under the &s;miles of royal patronage. What the FAIRY QUEEN could not procure for Spen&s;er from the penurious Eli&s;abeth and her preci&s;e mini&s;ters, Heywood gained by puns and conceits.</P>

<P>The work has its value and curio&s;ity as a repertory of proverbs made at &s;o early a period. Nor was the plan totally void of in|genuity, to exhibit the&s;e maxims in the cour&s;e of a narrative, enlivened by facts and circum&s;tances. It certainly was &s;u&s;ceptible of humour and invention.</P>
<P>Heywood's large&s;t and mo&s;t laboured performance is the SPI|DER AND THE FLIE, with wooden cuts, printed at London by Thomas Powell, in 1556 <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In quarto.</NOTE>. It is a very long poem in the octave &s;tanza, containing ninety-eight chapters. Perhaps there never was &s;o dull, &s;o tedious, and trifling an apologue: without fancy, meaning, or moral. A long tale of fictitious manners will always be tire&s;ome, unle&s;s the de&s;ign be burle&s;que: and then the ridiculous, ari&s;ing from the contra&s;t between the &s;olemn and the light, mu&s;t be ingeniou&s;ly &s;upported. Our author &s;eems to have intended a fable on the burle&s;que con&s;truction: but we know not when he would be &s;erious and when witty, whether he means to make the reader laugh, or to give him advice.

An old Scotch poem called SIR PENNY has been formed from this, printed in AN|TIENT SCOTTISH POEMS, p. 153. Edinb. 1770. [See &s;upr. vol. i. 9.]</NOTE>. Har|ri&s;on, the author of the DESCRIPTION OF BRITAINE, prefixed
<PB N="94" REF="198">
to Hollin&s;hed's Chronicle, has left a &s;en&s;ible critici&s;m on this poem. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"One hath made a boke of the SPIDER AND

BRIT. p. 226. Hollin&s;h. CHRON. tom. i.</NOTE>."</Q> It is a proof of the unpopularity of this poem, that it never was reprinted. Our author's EPIGRAMS, and the poem of PRO|VERBS, were in high vogue, and had numerous editions within the year 1598. The mo&s;t lively part of the SPIDER and FLIE is perhaps the mock-fight between the &s;piders and flies, an awk|ward imitation of Homer's BATRACHOMUOMACHY. The pre|parations for this bloody and eventful engagement, on the part of the &s;piders, in their cobweb-ca&s;tle, are thus de&s;cribed.</P>

</LG></Q>
<P>The beginning of all this confu&s;ion is owing to a fly entering the poet's window, not through a broken pane, as might be pre|&s;umed, but through the lattice, where it is &s;uddenly entangled in a cobweb <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Cap. i.</NOTE>. The cobweb, however, will be allowed to be &s;ufficiently

<P>In the CONCLUSION to the SPIDER and FLIE, Heywood mentions queen Mary and king Philip. But as mo&s;t of his pieces &s;eem to have been written &s;ome time be|fore, I have placed him under Henry the eighth.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>John Heywood died at Mechlin in Brabant about the year 1565. He was inflexibly attached to the catholic cau&s;e, and on the death of queen Mary quitted the kingdom. Antony Wood remarks <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">ATH. OXON. i. 150.</NOTE>, with his u&s;ual acrimony, that it was a matter of wonder with many, that, con&s;idering the great and u&s;ual want of principle in the profe&s;&s;ion, a poet &s;hould become a voluntary exile for the &s;ake of religion.</P>

It is evidently formed on the tragical &s;oliloquies, which compo&s;e Lydgate's paraphra&s;e of Boccace's book DE CASIBUS VIRORUM ILLUSTRIUM, and which gave birth to the MIRROR OF MAGISTRATES, the origin of our hi&s;toric dramas.

In the fourth &s;tanza, &s;he reproaches the a&s;trologers for their fal&s;ity in having predicted, that this &s;hould be the happie&s;t and mo&s;t fortunate year of her whole life. This, while it is a natural reflection in the &s;peaker, is a proof of More's contempt of a futile and frivolous &s;cience, then &s;o much in e&s;teem. I have been prolix in my citation from this forgotten poem: but I am of opinion, that &s;ome of the &s;tanzas have &s;trokes of nature and pathos, and de&s;erved to be re&s;cued from total oblivion.</P>
<P>More, when a young man, contrived in an apartment of his father's hou&s;e a <HI>goodly hangyng of fyne painted clothe,</HI> exhibiting nine pageants, or allegoric repre&s;entations, of the &s;tages of man's life, together with the figures of Death, Fame, Time, and Eternity.

<P>It appears to me, that the author, to give dignity to his nar|rative, and to heighten the ridicule by &s;tiffening the familiarity of his incidents and characters, has affected an antiquity of &s;tyle. This I could prove from the ca&s;t of its fundamental diction and idiom, with which many of the old words do not agree. Perhaps another of the author's affectations is the alli|terative manner. For although other &s;pecimens of alliteration, in &s;maller pieces, are now to be found, yet it was a &s;ingularity. To tho&s;e which I have mentioned, of this reign, I take this opportunity of adding an alliterative poem, which may be called the FALCON AND THE PIE, who &s;upport a DYALOGUE DE|SENSYVE FOR WOMEN AGAYNST MALICYOUS DETRAC|TOURS, printed in 1542 <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><P>Coloph. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thus endeth the faucon and pie anno dni 1542.

There is a &s;tatute, made in 1337, prohi|biting any under 100l. per annum, to wear fur. I &s;uppo&s;e the riche&s;t fur was Ermine; which, before the manufactures of gold and &s;ilver, was the greate&s;t article of finery in dre&s;s. But it continued in u&s;e long after|wards, as appears by antient portraits. In the Statutes of Cardinal Wol&s;ey's College at Oxford, given in the year 1525, the &s;tudents are enjoned, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ne magis pretio&s;is aut &s;umptuo&s;is utantur PELLIBUS."</Q> De VESTITU, &amp;c. fol. 49. MSS. Cott. TIT. F. iii. This injunction is a proof that rich furs were at that time a luxury of the &s;ecular life. In an old poem written in the reign of Henry the &s;ixth, about 1436, entitled the ENGLISH POLICIE, <HI>exhorting all England to keepe the &s;ea,</HI> a curious and valuable record of the &s;tate of our traffick and mercantile navigation at that period, it appears that our trade with Ireland, for furs only, was then very con&s;iderable.

<P>I FEAR I &s;hall be pronounced a heretic to modern critici&s;m, in retracting what I have &s;aid in a preceding page, and in placing the NOTBROWNE MAYDE under &s;ome part of this reign. Prior, who, about the year 1718, paraphra&s;ed this poem, without improving its native beauties, &s;uppo&s;es it to have been three hundred years old. It appears from two letters pre&s;erved in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, written by Prior to Wanley, lord Oxford's librarian, that Prior con&s;ulted Wanley about this antient ballad <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">MSS. HARL. 3777.</NOTE>. It is, however, certain, that Wanley, an antiquarian of unque&s;|tionable &s;kill and judgement in the&s;e niceties, whatever directions and information he might have imparted to Prior on this &s;ubject, could never have communicated &s;uch a deci&s;ion. He certainly in the&s;e letters gives no &s;uch opinion <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The&s;e letters are printed in the AD|DITIONS TO POPE'S WORKS, in two vo|lumes, publi&s;hed about two years ago.</NOTE>. This is therefore the ha&s;ty conjecture of Prior; who thought that the curio&s;ity which he was pre&s;enting to the world, would derive proportionable value from its antiquity, who was better employed than in the petty labour of a&s;certaining dates, and who knew much more of modern than antient poetry.</P>
<P>The NOT-BROWNE MAYDE fir&s;t appeared in Arnolde's CHRONICLE, or CUSTOMS OF LONDON, which was fir&s;t printed about the year 1521. This is perhaps the mo&s;t heterogeneous and multifarious mi&s;cellany that ever exi&s;ted. The collector &s;ets out with a catalogue of the mayors and &s;heriffs, the cu&s;toms and charters, of the city of London. Soon afterwards we have
<PB N="136" REF="240">
receipts to pickle &s;turgeon, to make vinegar, ink, and gun|powder; how to rai&s;e par&s;ley in an hour; the arts of brewery and &s;oap-making; an e&s;timate of the livings in London; an account of the la&s;t vi&s;itation of &s;aint Magnus's church; the weight of E&s;&s;ex chee&s;e, and a letter to cardinal Wol&s;ey. The NOT-BROWNE MAYDE is introduced, between an e&s;timate of &s;ome &s;ub&s;idies paid into the exchequer, and directions for buying goods in Flanders. In a word, it &s;eems to have been this com|piler's plan, by way of making up a volume, to print together all the notices and papers, whether antient or modern, which he could ama&s;s, of every &s;ort and &s;ubject. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that he intended an antiquarian repertory: but as many recent mate|rials were admitted, that idea was not at lea&s;t uniformly ob|&s;erved; nor can any argument be drawn from that &s;uppo&s;ition, that this poem exi&s;ted long before, and was in&s;erted as a piece of antiquity.</P>
<P>The editor of the PROLUSIONS infers <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">PROLUSIONS, or <HI>&s;elect pieces of antient Poetry,</HI> Lond. 1760. 4to. Pref. p. vii.</NOTE>, from an identity of rhythmus and orthography, and an affinity of words and phra&s;es, that this poem appeared after &s;ir Thomas More's JEST OF THE SERJEANT AND FREER, which, as I have ob&s;erved, was writ|ten about the year 1500. This rea&s;oning, were not other argu|ments obvious, would be inconclu&s;ive, and might be turned to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the que&s;tion. But it is evident from the language of the NOTBROWNE MAYDE, that it was not written earlier than the beginning, at lea&s;t, of the &s;ixteenth century. There is hardly an ob&s;olete word, or that requires a glo&s;&s;ary, in the whole piece: and many parts of Surry and Wyat are much more difficult to be under&s;tood. Reduce any two &s;tanzas to modern orthography, and they &s;hall hardly wear the appearance of antient poetry.

<P>What degree of credit this poem maintained among our earlier ance&s;tors, I cannot determine. I &s;u&s;pect the &s;entiment was too refined for the general ta&s;te. Yet it is enumerated among the popular tales and ballads by Laneham, in his narrative of queen Eli&s;abeth's entertainment at Kenilworth-ca&s;tle in 1575 <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ol. 34<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE>. I have never &s;een it in manu&s;cript. I believe it was never reprinted from Arnolde's Chronicle, where it fir&s;t appeared in 1521, till &s;o late as the year 1707. It was that year revived in a collec|tion called the MONTHLY MISCELLANY, or MEMO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">RS FOR THE CURIOUS, and prefaced with a little e&s;&s;ay on our antient poets and poetry, in which it is &s;aid to have been three hundred old. Fortunately for modern poetry, this republication &s;ugge&s;ted it to the notice of Prior, who perhaps from the &s;ame &s;ource might
<PB N="140" REF="244">
have adopted or confirmed his hypothe&s;is, that it was coeval with the commencement of the fifteenth century.</P>
<P>Whoever was the original inventor of this little dramatic dia|logue, he has &s;hewn no common &s;kill in contriving a plan, which powerfully detains our attention, and intere&s;ts the pa&s;|&s;ions, by a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;u&s;pence and plea&s;ure, of anxiety and &s;atisfaction. Betwixt hopes perpetually di&s;appointed, and &s;olicitude perpetually relieved, we know not how to determine the event of a debate, in which new difficulties &s;till continue to be rai&s;ed, and are almo&s;t as &s;oon removed. In the mid&s;t of this vici&s;&s;itude of feelings, a &s;triking contra&s;t of character is artfully formed, and uniformly &s;upported, between the &s;eeming unkind|ne&s;s and ingratitude of the man, and the unconquerable attach|ment and fidelity of the woman, who&s;e amiable compliance un|expectedly defeats every objection, and continually furni&s;hes new matter for our love and compa&s;&s;ion. At length, our fears &s;ub&s;ide in the triumph of &s;uffering innocence and patient &s;incerity. The Man, who&s;e hard &s;peeches had given us &s;o much pain, &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;es us with a change of &s;entiment, and becomes equally an object of our admiration and e&s;teem. In the di&s;entan|glement of this di&s;tre&s;sful tale, we are happy to find, that all his cruelty was tenderne&s;s, and his incon&s;tancy the mo&s;t invari|able truth; his levity an ingenious artifice, and his perver&s;ity the friendly di&s;gui&s;e of the firme&s;t affection. He is no longer an unfortunate exile, the profligate companion of the thieves and ruffians of the fore&s;t, but an opulent earl of We&s;tmoreland; and promi&s;es, that the lady, who is a baron's daughter, and who&s;e con&s;tancy he had proved by &s;uch a &s;eries of embarra&s;&s;ing propo&s;als, &s;hall in&s;tantly be made the partner of his riches and honours. Nor &s;hould we forget to commend the invention of the poet, in imagining the modes of trying the lady's patience, and in feigning &s;o many new &s;ituations: which, at the &s;ame time, open a way to de&s;cription, and to a variety of new &s;cenes and images.</P>
<P>I cannot help ob&s;erving here, by the way, that Prior has mi&s;conceived
<PB N="141" REF="245">
and e&s;&s;entially marred his poet's de&s;ign, by &s;oftening the &s;ternne&s;s of the Man, which could not be intended to admit of any degree of relaxation. Henry's hypocri&s;y is not charac|teri&s;tically nor con&s;i&s;tently &s;u&s;tained. He frequently talks in too re&s;pectful and complai&s;ant a &s;tyle. Sometimes he calls Emma my <HI>tender maid,</HI> and my <HI>beauteous Emma;</HI> he fondly dwells on the ambro&s;ial plenty of her flowing ringlets gracefully wreathed with variegated ribbands, and expatiates with rapture on the charms of her &s;nowy bo&s;om, her &s;lender wai&s;t, and harmony of &s;hape. In the antient poem, the concealed lover never abates his affectation of rigour and re&s;erve, nor ever drops an expre&s;|&s;ion which may tend to betray any traces of tenderne&s;s. He retains his &s;everity to the la&s;t, in order to give force to the conclu&s;ion of the piece, and to heighten the effect of the final declaration of his love. Thus, by dimini&s;hing the oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts, and by giving too great a degree of uniformity to both characters, the di&s;tre&s;s is in &s;ome mea&s;ure de&s;troyed by Prior. For this rea&s;on, Henry, during the cour&s;e of the dia|logue, is le&s;s an object of our aver&s;ion, and Emma of our pity. But the&s;e are the unavoidable con&s;equences of Prior's plan, who pre&s;uppo&s;es a long connection between the lovers, which is at|tended with the warme&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of a reciprocal pa&s;&s;ion. Yet this very plan &s;ugge&s;ted another rea&s;on, why Prior &s;hould have more clo&s;ely copied the ca&s;t of his original. After &s;o many mutual promi&s;es and prote&s;tations, to have made Henry more obdurate, would have enhanced the &s;ufferings and the &s;incerity of the amiable Emma.</P>

<P>Many ample and authentic records of the royal hou&s;hold of France, of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, written on waxen tablets, are &s;till pre&s;erved.

See the Sieur le Brun's VOYAGE LITURGIQUE, 1718. p. 275. The &s;ame mode of writing was u&s;ed for regi&s;tering the capitular acts of the mona&s;|teries in France.

It may not be foreign to our purpo&s;e, to give the reader &s;ome di&s;tinct idea of the polite amu&s;ements of this reign, among which, the Ma&s;que, already mentioned in general terms, &s;eems to have held the fir&s;t place. It chiefly con&s;i&s;ted of mu&s;ic, dancing, gaming, a banquet, and a di&s;play of grote&s;que per&s;onages and fanta&s;tic dre&s;&s;es. The performers, as I have hinted, were often the king, and the chief of the nobility of both &s;exes, who under proper di&s;gui&s;es executed &s;ome preconcerted &s;trategem, which ended in mirth and good humour. With one of the&s;e &s;hews, in 1530, the king formed a &s;cheme to &s;urpri&s;e cardinal Wol&s;ey, while he was celebrating a &s;plendid banquet at his palace of Whitehall <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">It th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n belonged to Wol&s;ey.</NOTE>. At night his maje&s;ty in a ma&s;que, with twelve more ma&s;quers all richly but &s;trangely dre&s;&s;ed, privately landed from We&s;tmin&s;ter at Whitehall &s;tairs. At landing, &s;everal &s;mall pieces of canon were fired, which the king had before ordered to be placed on the &s;hore near the hou&s;e. The cardinal, who was &s;epa|rately &s;eated at the banquet in the pre&s;ence-chamber under the cloth of &s;tate, a great number of ladies and lords being &s;eated at the &s;ide-tables, was alarmed at this &s;udden and unu&s;ual noi&s;e: and immediately ordered lord Sandys, the king's chamberlain, who was one of the gue&s;ts, and in the &s;ecret, to enquire the rea&s;on. Lord Sandys brought an&s;wer, that thirteen foreign no|blemen of di&s;tinction were ju&s;t arrived, and were then waiting in the great hall below; having been drawn thither by the re|port of the cardinal's magnificent banquet, and of the beautiful ladies which were pre&s;ent at it. The cardinal ordered them immediately into the banquetting-room, to which they were conducted from the hall with twenty new torches and a concert of drums and fifes. After a proper refre&s;hment, they reque&s;ted in the French language to dance with the ladies, whom they ki&s;&s;ed, and to play with them at mum-chance <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">A game of hazard with dic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>; producing at the &s;ame time a great golden cup filled with many hundred crowns.

At this, the king could not forbear laughing aloud: and pulling off his own and &s;ir Edward Nevil's ma&s;que, convinced the cardinal, with much arch complai&s;ance, that he had for once gue&s;&s;ed wrong. The king and the ma&s;quers then retired into another apartment to change their apparel: and in the meantime the banquet was re|moved, and the table covered afre&s;h with perfumed clothes. Soon afterwards the king, with his company, returned, and took his &s;eat under the cardinal's canopy of &s;tate. Immediately two hundred di&s;hes of the mo&s;t co&s;tly cookery and confectionary were &s;erved up; the contrivance and &s;ucce&s;s of the royal joke afforded much plea&s;ant conver&s;ation, and the night was &s;pent in dancing, dice-playing, <HI>banketting and other triumphs</HI> <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hollin&s;h.

&s;eems to have been, to &s;urpri&s;e, by the ridiculous and exag|gerated oddity of the vi&s;ors, and by the &s;ingularity and &s;plendor of the dre&s;&s;es. Every thing was out of nature and propriety. Frequently the Ma&s;que was attended with an exhibition of &s;ome gorgeous machinery, re&s;embling the wonders of a modern pan|tomime. For in&s;tance, in the great hall of the palace, the u&s;ual place of performance, a va&s;t mountain covered with tall trees aro&s;e &s;uddenly, from who&s;e opening caverns i&s;&s;ued hermits, pilgrims, &s;hepherds, knights, dam&s;els, and gyp&s;ies, who being regaled with &s;pices and wine danced a mori&s;co, or morris-dance. They were then again received into the mountain, which with a &s;ymphony of rebecs and recorders clo&s;ed its caverns; and tumbling to pieces, was replaced by a &s;hip in full &s;ail, or a ca&s;tle be&s;ieged. To be more particular. The following device was &s;hewn in the hall of the palace at Greenwich. A ca&s;tle was reared, with numerous towers, gates, and battlements; and fur|ni&s;hed with every military preparation for &s;u&s;taining a long &s;iege.

They a&s;&s;aulted the ca&s;tle; and the &s;ix ladies, finding them to be champions of redoubted prowe&s;s, after a parley, yielded their perilous fortre&s;s, de&s;cended, and danced with their a&s;&s;ailants.

<P>But towards the latter part of Henry's reign, much of the old cumber&s;ome &s;tate began to be laid a&s;ide.

In the Chapter <HI>For keeping the Hall and ordering of the Chapel,</HI> it is recited, that by the frequent intermi&s;&s;ion and di&s;u&s;e of the &s;olemnities of dining and &s;upping in the great hall of the palace, the proper officers had almo&s;t forgot their duty, and the manner of conducting that very long and intricate ceremonial. It is therefore ordered, that when his maje&s;ty is not at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and with regard to his palaces in the country, the formalities of the Hall, which ought not en|tirely to fall into de&s;uetude, &s;hall be at lea&s;t ob&s;erved, when he is at Wind&s;or, Beaulieu, or Newhall <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">A new hou&s;e built by Henry the eighth.

And that at the&s;e places only, the whole choir of the chapel &s;hall attend. This attempt to revive that which had began to cea&s;e from the nature of things, and from the growth of new manners, per|haps had but little or no la&s;ting effect. And with re&s;pect to the Chapel, my record adds, that when the king is on journies or progre&s;&s;es, only &s;ix &s;inging boys and &s;ix gentlemen of the choir &s;hall make a part of the royal retinue; who <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"daylie in ab&s;ence of <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;idue</HI> of the chapel &s;hall have a Ma&s;&s;e of our Ladie bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ore noon, and on Sondaies and holidaies, ma&s;&s;e of the day be&s;ides our Lady-ma&s;&s;e, and an anthempne in the afternoone:

<P>The &s;ame connection &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the &s;tate of poetry and of the arts; to which we may now recall the reader's attention with as little violation of our general &s;ubject.</P>
<P>We are taught in the mythology of the antients, that the three Graces were produced at a birth. The meaning of the fable is, that the three mo&s;t beautiful imitative arts were born and grew up together. Our poetry now beginning to be dive&s;ted of its mo|na&s;tic barbari&s;m, and to advance towards elegance, was accompa|nied by proportionable improvements in Painting and Mu&s;ic. Henry employed many capital painters, and endeavoured to invite Raphael and Titian into England. In&s;tead of allegorical tape&s;try, many of the royal apartments were adorned with hi&s;torical pic|tures. Our familiarity with the manners of Italy, and affecta|tion of Italian accompli&s;hments, influenced the tones and enriched
<PB N="160" REF="264">
the modulation of our mu&s;ical compo&s;ition. Tho&s;e who could read the &s;onnets of Petrarch mu&s;t have reli&s;hed the airs of Pale&s;trina. At the &s;ame time, Architecture, like Milton's lion <HI>pawing to get free,</HI> made frequent efforts to di&s;entangle it&s;elf from the ma&s;&s;y incumbrances of the Gothic manner; and began to catch the correct graces, and to copy the true mag|nificence, of the Grecian and Roman models. Henry was him&s;elf a great builder; and his numerous edifices, although con&s;tructed altogether on the antient &s;y&s;tem, are &s;ometimes in|ter&s;per&s;ed with cha&s;te ornaments and graceful mouldings, and often marked with a legitimacy of proportion, and a purity of de&s;ign, before unattempted. It was among the literary plans of Leland, one of the mo&s;t cla&s;&s;ical &s;cholars of this age, to write an account of Henry's palaces, in imitation of Procopius, who is &s;aid to have de&s;cribed the palaces of the emperor Ju&s;tinian. Frequent &s;ymptoms appeared, that perfection in every work of ta&s;te was at no great di&s;tance.

<P>THE reformation of our church produced an alteration for a time in the general &s;y&s;tem of &s;tudy, and changed the character and &s;ubjects of our poetry. Every mind, both learned and unlearned, was bu&s;ied in religious &s;peculation; and every pen was employed in recommending, illu&s;trating, and familiari|&s;ing the Bible, which was now laid open to the people.</P>
<P>The poetical annals of king Edward the &s;ixth, who removed tho&s;e chains of bigottry which his brother Henry had only loo&s;ened, are marked with metrical tran&s;lations of various parts of the &s;acred &s;cripture. Of the&s;e the chief is the ver&s;ification of the P&s;alter by Sternhold and Hopkins: a performance, which has acquired an importance, and con&s;equently claims a place in our &s;eries, not &s;o much from any merit of its own, as from the circum&s;tances with which it is connected.</P>
<P>It is extraordinary, that the prote&s;tant churches &s;hould be in|debted to a country in which the reformation had never begun to make any progre&s;s, and even to the indulgence of a &s;ociety which remains to this day the grand bulwark of the catholic theology, for a very di&s;tingui&s;hing and e&s;&s;ential part of their ritual.</P>

of the rondeau, and the re&s;torer of the madrigal: but he became chiefly eminent for his pa&s;torals, ballads, fables, elegies, epi|grams, and tran&s;lations from Ovid and Petrarch. At length, being tired of the vanities of profane poetry, or rather privately tinctured with the principles of Lutherani&s;m, he attempted, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friend Theodore Beza, and by the en|couragement of the profe&s;&s;or of Hebrew in the univer&s;ity of Paris, a ver&s;ion of David's P&s;alms into French rhymes. This tran&s;lation, which did not aim at any innovation in the public wor&s;hip, and which received the &s;anction of the Sorbonne as containing nothing contrary to &s;ound doctrine, he dedicated to his ma&s;ter Francis the fir&s;t, and to the Ladies of France. In the dedication to the Ladies or <HI>les Dames de France,</HI> whom he had often before addre&s;&s;ed in the tendere&s;t &s;trains of pa&s;&s;ion or com|pliment, he &s;eems anxious to deprecate the raillery which the new tone of his ver&s;ification was likely to incur, and is embar|ra&s;&s;ed how to find an apology for turning &s;aint. Con&s;cious of his apo&s;tacy from the levities of life, in a &s;pirit of religious gallantry, he declares that his de&s;ign is to add to the happine&s;s of his fair readers, by &s;ub&s;tituting divine hymns in the place of <HI>chan&s;ons d' amour,</HI> to in&s;pire their &s;u&s;ceptible hearts with a pa&s;&s;ion in which there is no torment, to bani&s;h that fickle and fanta&s;tic deity CUPID from the world, and to fill their apartments with the prai&s;es, not of the <HI>little god,</HI> but of the true Jehovah.</P>

<P>Marot's P&s;alms &s;oon eclip&s;ed the brilliancy of his madrigals and &s;onnets. Not &s;u&s;pecting how prejudicial the predominant rage of p&s;alm-&s;inging might prove to the antient religion of Europe, the catholics them&s;elves adopted the&s;e &s;acred &s;ongs as &s;erious ballads, and as a more rational &s;pecies of dome&s;tic merri|ment. Thy were the common accompaniments of the fiddle. They were &s;old &s;o rapidly, that the printers could not &s;upply the public with copies. In the fe&s;tive and &s;plendid court of Francis the fir&s;t, of a &s;udden nothing was heard but the p&s;alms of Clement Marot. By each of the royal family and the principal nobility of the court a p&s;alm was cho&s;en, and fitted to the ballad-tune which each liked be&s;t.

It was on very different princi|ples that p&s;almody flouri&s;hed in the gloomy court of Cromwell. This fa&s;hion does not &s;eem in the lea&s;t to have dimini&s;hed the gaiety and good humour of the court of Francis.</P>
<P>At this period John Calvin, in oppo&s;ition to the di&s;cipline and doctrines of Rome, was framing his novel church at Ge|neva: in which the whole &s;ub&s;tance and form of divine wor&s;hip was reduced to praying, preaching, and &s;inging. In the la&s;t of the&s;e three, he cho&s;e to depart widely from the catholic u&s;age: and, either becau&s;e he thought that novelty was &s;ure to &s;ucceed, that the practice of antiphonal chanting was &s;uper&s;titious, or that the people were excluded from bearing a part in the more &s;olemn and elaborate performance of eccle&s;ia&s;tical mu&s;ic, or that the old papi&s;tic hymns were unedifying, or that ver&s;e was better remembered than pro&s;e, he projected, with the advice of Luther, a &s;pecies of religious &s;ong, con&s;i&s;ting of portions of the p&s;alms intelligibly tran&s;lated into the vernacular language, and adapted to plain and ea&s;y melodies, which all might learn, and in which all might join. This &s;cheme, either by de&s;ign or acci|dent, was luckily &s;econded by the publication of Marot's metri|cal p&s;alms at Paris, which Calvin immediately introduced into his congregation at Geneva. Being &s;et to &s;imple and almo&s;t mo|notonous notes by Guillaume de Franc, they were &s;oon e&s;tab|li&s;hed as the principal branch in that reformer's new devotion, and became a characteri&s;tical mark or badge of the Calvini&s;tic wor&s;hip and profe&s;&s;ion. Nor were they &s;ung only in his churches. They exhilarated the convivial a&s;&s;emblies of the Calvini&s;ts, were commonly heard in the &s;treets, and accompanied the labours of the artificer. The weavers and woollen manufacturers of Flanders, many of whom left the loom and entered into the mini&s;try, are &s;aid to have been the capital performers into this &s;cience. At length Marot's p&s;alms formed an appendix to the catechi&s;m of Geneva, and were interdicted to the catholics under the mo&s;t
<PB N="165" REF="269">
&s;evere penalties. In the language of the orthodox, p&s;alm-&s;inging and here&s;y were &s;ynonimous terms.</P>
<P>It was Calvin's &s;y&s;tem of reformation, not only to &s;trip reli|gion of its &s;uper&s;titious and o&s;ten&s;ible pageantries, of crucifixes, images, tapers, &s;uperb ve&s;tments, and &s;plendid proce&s;&s;ions, but of all that was e&s;timable in the &s;ight of the people, and even of every &s;imple ornament, every &s;ignificant &s;ymbol, and decent ceremony; in a word, to bani&s;h every thing from his church which attracted or employed the &s;en&s;es, or which might tend to mar the purity of an ab&s;tracted adoration, and of a mental in|tercour&s;e with the deity. It is hard to determine, how Calvin could reconcile the u&s;e of &s;inging, even when purged from the corruptions and abu&s;es of popery, to &s;o philo&s;ophical a plan of wor&s;hip. On a parallel principle, and if any artificial aids to devotion were to be allowed, he might at lea&s;t have retained the u&s;e of pictures in the church. But a new &s;ect always draws its converts from the multitude and the meane&s;t of the people, who can have no reli&s;h for the more elegant externals. Calvin well knew that the manufacturers of Germany were no judges of pictures. At the &s;ame time it was nece&s;&s;ary that his congrega|tion &s;hould be kept in good humour by &s;ome kind of plea&s;urable gratification and allurement, which might qualify and enliven the attendance on the more rigid duties of praying and preach|ing. Calvin therefore, intent as he was to form a new church on a &s;evere model, had yet too much &s;agacity to exclude every auxiliary to devotion. Under this idea, he permitted an exerci&s;e, which might engage the affections, without violating the &s;impli|city of his wor&s;hip: and &s;en&s;ible that his chief re&s;ources were in the rabble of a republic, and availing him&s;elf of that natural propen&s;ity which prompts even vulgar minds to expre&s;s their more animated feelings in rhyme and mu&s;ic, he conceived a mode of univer&s;al p&s;almody, not too refined for common capa|cities, and fitted to plea&s;e the populace. The rapid propagation of Calvin's religion, and his numerous pro&s;elytes, are a &s;trong proof of his addre&s;s in planning &s;uch a &s;ort of &s;ervice. France
<PB N="166" REF="270">
and Germany were in&s;tantly infatuated with a love of p&s;alm|&s;inging: which being admirably calculated to kindle and diffu&s;e the flame of fanatici&s;m, was peculiarly &s;erviceable to the pur|po&s;es of faction, and frequently &s;erved as the trumpet to rebel|lion. The&s;e energetic hymns of Geneva, under the conduct of the Calvini&s;tic preachers, excited and &s;upported a variety of po|pular in&s;urrections; they filled the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing cities of the Low-countries with &s;edition and tumult, and fomented the fury which defaced many of the mo&s;t beautiful and venerable churches of Flanders.</P>
<P>This infectious frenzy of &s;acred &s;ong &s;oon reached England, at the very critical point of time, when it had ju&s;t embraced the reformation: and the new p&s;almody was obtruded on the new Engli&s;h liturgy by &s;ome few officious zealots, who favoured the di&s;cipline of Geneva, and who wi&s;hed to aboli&s;h, not only the choral mode of wor&s;hip in general, but more particularly to &s;uppre&s;s the TE DEUM, BENEDICTUS, MAGNIFICAT, JUBI|LATE, NUNC DIMITTIS, and the re&s;t of the liturgic hymns, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to be contaminated by their long and antient connection with the Roman mi&s;&s;al, or at lea&s;t in their pro&s;aic form, to be un&s;uitable to the new &s;y&s;tem of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Although Wyat and Surrey had before made tran&s;lations of the P&s;alms into metre, Thomas Sternhold was the fir&s;t who&s;e metrical ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms was u&s;ed in the church of Eng|land. Sternhold was a native of Hamp&s;hire, and probably edu|cated at Winche&s;ter college. Having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at Oxford, he became groom of the robes to king Henry the eighth. In this department, either his diligent &s;ervices or his knack at rhyming &s;o plea&s;ed the king, that his maje&s;ty bequeathed him a legacy of one hundred marks. He continued in the &s;ame office under Edward the &s;ixth, and is &s;aid to have acquired &s;ome degree of reputation about the court for his poetry. Being of a &s;erious di&s;po&s;ition, and an enthu&s;ia&s;t to reformation, he was much of|fended at the la&s;civious ballads which prevailed among the cour|tiers: and, with a laudable de&s;ign to check the&s;e indecencies, undertook
<PB N="167" REF="271">
a metrical ver&s;ion of the P&s;alter, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"thinking thereby, &s;ays Antony Wood, that the courtiers would &s;ing them in&s;tead of their &s;onnets, <HI>but did not,</HI> only &s;ome few excepted <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">ATH. Oxon. i. 76.</NOTE>."</Q> Here was the zeal, if not the &s;ucce&s;s, of his fellow labourer Clement Marot. A &s;ingular coincidence of circum&s;tances is, notwith|&s;tanding, to be remarked on this occa&s;ion. Vernacular ver&s;ions for general u&s;e of the P&s;alter were fir&s;t publi&s;hed both in France and England, by laymen, by court-poets, and by &s;ervants of the court. Nor were the re&s;pective tran&s;lations entirely completed by them&s;elves: and yet they tran&s;lated nearly an equal number of p&s;alms, Marot having ver&s;ified fifty, and Sternhold fifty-one. Sternhold died in the year 1549. His fifty-one p&s;alms were printed the &s;ame year by Edward Whitchurch, under the fol|lowing title. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All &s;uch P&s;alms of David as Thomas Stern|holde late grome of the kinges Maie&s;tyes robes did in his ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e tyme drawe into Englys&s;he metre."</Q> They are without the mu&s;ical notes, as is the &s;econd edition in 1552. He probably lived to prepare the fir&s;t edition for the pre&s;s, as it is dedicated by him&s;elf to king Edward the &s;ixth.</P>
<P>Cotemporary with Sternhold, and his coadjutor, was John Hopkins: of who&s;e life nothing more is known, than that he was a clergyman and a &s;choolma&s;ter of Suffolk, and perhaps a graduate at Oxford about the year 1544. Of his abilities as a teacher of the cla&s;&s;ics, he has left a &s;pecimen in &s;ome Latin &s;tanzas prefixed to FOX'S MARTYROLOGY. He is rather a better Engli&s;h poet than Sternhold; and tran&s;lated fifty eight of the p&s;alms, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the initials of his name.</P>
<P>Of the re&s;t of the contributors to this undertaking, the chief, at lea&s;t in point of rank and learning, was William Whytting|ham, promoted by Robert earl of Leice&s;ter to the deanery of Durham, yet not without a &s;trong reluctance to comply with the u&s;e of the canonical habiliments. Among our reli|gious exiles in the reign of Mary, he was Calvin's principal
<PB N="168" REF="272">
favorite, from whom he received ordination. So pure was his faith, that he was thought worthy to &s;ucceed to the congrega|tion of Geneva, &s;uperintended by Knox, the Scotch reformer; who, from a dete&s;tation of idols, proceeded to demoli&s;h the churches in which they were contained. It was one of the natural con&s;equences of Whyttingham's tran&s;lation from Knox's pa&s;tor&s;hip at Geneva to an Engli&s;h deanery, that he de&s;troyed or removed many beautiful and harmle&s;s monuments of antient art in his cathedral. To a man, who had &s;o highly &s;pirituali&s;ed his religious conceptions, as to be convinced that a field, a &s;treet, or a barn, were fully &s;ufficient for all the operations of chri&s;|tian wor&s;hip, the venerable &s;tructures rai&s;ed by the magnificent piety of our ance&s;tors could convey no ideas of &s;olemnity, and had no other charms than their ample endowments. Be&s;ide the p&s;alms he tran&s;lated <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Among them is the hundreth, and the hundred and nineteenth.</NOTE>, all which bear his initials, by way of in|novating &s;till further on our e&s;tabli&s;hed formularly, he ver&s;ified the Decalogue, the Nicene, Apo&s;tolic, and Athana&s;ian Creeds, the Lord's Prayer, the TE DEUM, the Song of the three Children, with other hymns which follow the book of p&s;almody. How the Ten Commandments and the Athana&s;ian Creed, to &s;ay no|thing of &s;ome of the re&s;t, &s;hould become more edifying and better &s;uited to common u&s;e, or how they could receive im|provement in any re&s;pect or degree, by being reduced into rhym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, it is not ea&s;y to perceive. But the real de&s;ign was, to render that more tolerable which could not be entirely removed, to accommodate every part of the &s;ervice to the p&s;almodic tone, and to clothe our whole liturgy in the garb of Geneva. All the&s;e, for he was a lover of mu&s;ic, were &s;ung in Whytting|ham's church of Durham under his own directions.

with all other writers employed in a &s;imilar ta&s;k. Allowing for the &s;tate of our language in the middle of the &s;ixteenth century, they appear to have been but little qualified either by genius or accompli&s;hments for poetical compo&s;ition. It is for this rea&s;on that they have produced a tran&s;lation entirely de&s;titute of ele|gance, &s;pirit, and propriety. The truth is, that they undertook this work, not &s;o much from an ambition of literary fame, or a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of abilities, as from motives of piety, and in compliance with the ca&s;t of the times. I pre&s;ume I am com|municating no very new critici&s;m when I ob&s;erve, that in every part of this tran&s;lation we are di&s;gu&s;ted with a languor of ver&s;ifi|cation, and a want of common pro&s;ody. The mo&s;t exalted effu&s;ions of thank&s;giving, and the mo&s;t &s;ublime imageries of the divine maje&s;ty, are lowered by a coldne&s;s of conception, weak|ened by frigid interpolations, and disfigured by a poverty of phra&s;eology.

Yet however they may be allowed to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of private edification, in admini&s;tering &s;piri|tual con&s;olation to the manufacturer and mechanic, as they are extrin&s;ic to the frame of our liturgy, and incompatible with the genius of our &s;ervice, there is perhaps no im|propriety in wi&s;hing, that they were remitted and re&s;trained to that church in which they &s;prung, and with who&s;e character and con&s;titution they &s;eem &s;o aptly to corre&s;pond. Whatever e&s;timation in point of compo&s;ition they might have attracted at their fir&s;t appearance in a ruder age, and however in&s;trumental they might have been at the infancy of the refor|mation in weaning the minds of men from the papi&s;tic ritual, all the&s;e con&s;iderations can now no longer &s;upport even a &s;pe|cious argument for their being retained. From the circum|&s;tances of the times, and the growing refinements of literature, of cour&s;e they become ob&s;olete and contemptible. A work grave, &s;erious, and even re&s;pectable for its poetry, in the reign of Edward the &s;ixth, at length in a cultivated age, has con|tracted the air of an ab&s;olute trave&s;tie. Voltaire ob&s;erves, that in proportion as good ta&s;te improved, the p&s;alms of Clement Marot in&s;pired only di&s;gu&s;t: and that although they charmed the court of Francis the fir&s;t, they &s;eemed only to be calculated for the populace in the reign of Lewis the fourteenth <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">HIST.

<P>To obviate the&s;e objections, attempts have been made from time to time to moderni&s;e this antient metrical ver&s;ion, and to render it more tolerable and intelligible by the &s;ub&s;titution of more familiar modes of diction.

They con|tended that the metrical p&s;alms of David, &s;et to plain and po|pular mu&s;ic, were more &s;uitable to the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, and abundantly adequate to all the purpo&s;es of edification: and this propo&s;al they re&s;ted on the authority and practice of Calvin, between whom and the church of England the breach was not then &s;o wide as at pre&s;ent. But the queen and tho&s;e bi&s;hops to whom &s;he had delegated the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;upervi&s;ing the liturgy, among which was the learned and liberal archbi&s;hop Parker, objected, that too much attention had already been paid to the German theology.

<P>Whatever might at fir&s;t have been his de&s;ign, it is certain that his ver&s;ion, although printed, was never publi&s;hed: and notwith&s;tanding the formality of his metrical preface abovementioned,
<PB N="183" REF="287">
which was profe&s;&s;edly written to &s;hew the &s;piritual efficacy or virtue of the p&s;alms in metre, and in which he di|rects a di&s;tinct and audible mode of congregational &s;inging, he probably &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it, becau&s;e he &s;aw that the practice had been abu&s;ed to the purpo&s;es of fanatici&s;m, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dopted by the puri|tans in contradiction to the national wor&s;hip; or at lea&s;t that &s;uch a publication, whatever his private &s;entiments might have been, would not have &s;uited the nature and dignity of his high office in the church. Some of our mu&s;ical antiquaries, however, have ju&s;tly conjectured, that the archbi&s;hop, who was &s;killed in mu&s;ic, and had formerly founded a mu&s;ic-&s;chool in his college of Stoke Clare, intended the&s;e p&s;alms, which are adapted to complicated tunes of four parts probably con&s;tructed by him|&s;elf and here given in &s;core, for the u&s;e of cathedrals; at a time, when compo&s;itions in counterpoint were uncommon in the church, and when that part of our choir-&s;ervice called the motet or anthem, which admits a more artificial di&s;play of har|mony, and which is recommended and allowed in queen Eli&s;a|beth's earlie&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical injunctions, was yet almo&s;t unknown, or but in a very imperfect &s;tate. Accordingly, although the di|rection is not quite comprehen&s;ible, he orders many of them to be &s;ung by the <HI>rector chori,</HI> or chantor, and the <HI>quier,</HI> or choir, alternately. That at lea&s;t he had a ta&s;te for mu&s;ic, we may conclude from the following not inelegant &s;cale of modulation, prefixed to his eight tunes abovementioned.</P>

<P>A con&s;iderable contributor to the metrical theology was Robert Crowley, educated in Magdalene college at Oxford, where he obtained a fellow&s;hip in 1542.

He tran&s;lated into popular rhyme, not only the p&s;alter, but the litany, with hymns, all which he printed together in 1549. In the &s;ame year, and in the &s;ame mea&s;ure, he publi&s;hed <HI>The Voice of the la&s;t Trumpet blown by the &s;eventh angel.</HI> This piece contains twelve &s;everal le&s;&s;ons, for the in&s;truction or amendment of tho&s;e who &s;eemed at that time chiefly to need advice; and among whom he enu|merates <HI>lewd</HI> prie&s;ts, &s;cholars, phy&s;icians, beggars, yeomen, gentlemen,

Many of the&s;e, to &s;ay nothing of his almo&s;t innumerable controver&s;ial tracts in pro&s;e, had repeated editions, and from his own pre&s;s.

<P>BUT among the theological ver&s;ifiers of the&s;e times, the mo&s;t notable is Chri&s;topher Tye, a doctor of mu&s;ic at Cambridge in 1545, and mu&s;ical preceptor to prince Edward, and probably to his &s;i&s;ters the prince&s;&s;es Mary and Eli&s;abeth. In the reign of Eli&s;abeth he was organi&s;t of the royal chapel, in which he had been educated. To his profe&s;&s;ion of mu&s;ic, he joined &s;ome knowledge of Engli&s;h literature: and having been taught to believe that rhyme and edification were clo&s;ely con|nected, and being per&s;uaded that every part of the Scripture would be more in&s;tructive and better received if reduced into ver&s;e, he projected a tran&s;lation of the ACTS OF THE APOS|TLES into familiar metre. It appears that the BOOK OF KINGS had before been ver&s;ified, which for many rea&s;ons was more capable of &s;hining under the hands of a tran&s;lator. But the mo&s;t &s;plendid hi&s;torical book, I mean the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of poetic ornament, in the Old or New Te&s;tament, would have become ridiculous when clothed in the fa&s;hionable eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tanza. Perhaps the plan of &s;etting a narrative of this kind to mu&s;ic, was &s;till more prepo&s;terous and exceptionable. How|ever, he completed only the fir&s;t fourteen chapters: and they were printed in 1553, by William Serres, with the following title, which by the reader, who is not acquainted with the pe|culiar complexion of this period, will hardly be &s;u&s;pected to be &s;erious. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The ACTES OF THE APOSTLES tran&s;lated into Engly&s;he metre, and dedicated to the kinges mo&s;t excellent maie&s;tye by Cri&s;tofer Tye, doctor in mu&s;yke, and one of the

The impropriety of the de&s;ign, and the im|potency of the execution, &s;eem to have been perceived even by his own prejudiced and undi&s;cerning age.

Before the middle of the reign of Eli&s;abeth, at a time when the more ornamental and in|tricate mu&s;ic was wanted in our &s;ervice, he concurred with the celebrated Tallis and a few others in &s;etting &s;everal anthems, which are not only ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed to retain much of the ori|ginal &s;train of our antient choral melody before the reformation, but in re&s;pect of harmony, expre&s;&s;ion, contrivance, and general effect, are allowed to be perfect models of the genuine eccle&s;ia&s;tic &s;tyle. Fuller informs us, that Tye was the chief re&s;torer of the lo&s;s which the mu&s;ic of the church had &s;u&s;tained by the de|&s;truction of the mona&s;teries <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">WORTHI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">S, ii. 244.

<P>It is not my intention to pur&s;ue any farther the mob of reli|gious rhymers, who, from principles of the mo&s;t unfeigned piety, devoutly laboured to darken the lu&s;tre, and enervate the force, of the divine pages. And perhaps I have been already too prolix in examining a &s;pecies of poetry, if it may be &s;o called, which even impoveri&s;hes pro&s;e; or rather, by mixing the &s;tile of pro&s;e with ver&s;e, and of ver&s;e with pro&s;e, de&s;troys

the character and effect of both. But in &s;urveying the general cour&s;e of a &s;pecies of literature, ab&s;urdities as well as excellen|cies, the weakne&s;s and the vigour of the human mind, mu&s;t have their hi&s;torian. Nor is it unplea&s;ing to trace and to con|template tho&s;e &s;trange incongruities, and fal&s;e ideas of perfection, which at various times, either affectation, or caprice, or fa&s;hion, or opinion, or prejudi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e, or ignorance, or enthu&s;ia&s;m, pre&s;ent to the conceptions of men, in the &s;hape of truth.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not, however, forget, that king Edward the &s;ixth is to be ranked among the religious poets of his own reign. Fox has publi&s;hed his metrical in&s;tructions concerning the euchari&s;t, addre&s;&s;ed to &s;ir Antony Saint Leger. Bale al&s;o mentions his comedy called the WHORE OF BABYLON, which Holland the heroologi&s;t, who perhaps had never &s;een it, and knew not whether it was a play or a ballad, in ver&s;e or pro&s;e, pronounces to be a mo&s;t elegant perfo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mance <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">HEROOLOG. p. 27.</NOTE>. Its elegance, with &s;ome, will not perhaps apologi&s;e or atone for its &s;ubject: and it may &s;eem &s;trange, that controver&s;ial ribaldry &s;hould have been &s;uf|fered to enter into the education of a great monarch. But the genius, habits, and &s;ituation; of his age &s;hould be con&s;idered. The reformation was the great political topic of Edward's court. Intricate di&s;cu&s;&s;ions in divinity were no longer confined to the &s;chools or the clergy. The new religion, from its novelty, as well as importance, intere&s;ted every mind, and was almo&s;t the &s;ole object of the general attention. Men emancipated from the &s;everities of a &s;piritual tyranny, reflected with horror on the &s;lavery they had &s;o long &s;uffered, and with exultation on the triumph they had obtained. The&s;e feelings were often expre&s;&s;ed in a &s;train of enthu&s;ia&s;m. The &s;pirit of innovation, which had &s;eized the times, often tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the bounds of truth. Every change of religion is attended with tho&s;e ebullitions, which growing more moderate by degrees, afterwards appear eccentric and ridiculous.</P>

We who live at a di&s;tance from this great and national &s;trug|gle between popery and prote&s;tanti&s;m, when our church has been long and peaceably e&s;tabli&s;hed, and in an age of good &s;en&s;e, of politene&s;s and philo&s;ophy, are apt to view the&s;e effu&s;ions of royal piety as weak and unworthy the character of a king. But an o&s;tentation of zeal and example in the young Edward, as it was natural &s;o it was nece&s;&s;ary, while the reformation was yet immature.

<P>I mu&s;t add here, in reference to my general &s;ubject, that the tran&s;lation of the Bible, which in the reign of Edward the &s;ixth was admitted into the churches, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have fixed our language. It certainly has tran&s;mitted and perpetuated many antient words which would otherwi&s;e have been ob&s;olete or un|intelligible. I have never &s;een it remarked, that at the &s;ame time this tran&s;lation contributed to enrich our native Engli&s;h at an early period, by importing and familiari&s;ing many Latin words <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>More particularly in the Latin deriva|tive &s;ub&s;tantives, &s;uch as,</HI> divination, perdi|tion, adoption, manife&s;tatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, con&s;olation, con|tribution, admini&s;tration, con&s;ummation, recon|ciliation, operation, communication, retribution, preparation, immortality, principality, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.

<P>The&s;e were &s;ugge&s;ted by the Latin vulgate, which was u&s;ed as a medium by the tran&s;lators.

It was now fa&s;hionable for every young man of fortune, before he began his travels, or was admitted into parliament, to be initiated in the &s;tudy of the law. But in&s;tead of pur&s;uing a &s;cience, which could not be his profe&s;&s;ion, and which was unaccommodated to the bias of his genius, he betrayed his predilection to a more plea&s;ing &s;pecies of literature, by compo&s;ing the tragedy ju&s;t mentioned, for the entertainment and honour of his fellow-&s;tudents. His high birth, however, and ample patrimony, &s;oon advanced him to more important &s;ituations and employments.

It was either becau&s;e his mi&s;tre&s;s Eli&s;abeth paid a &s;incere compli|ment to his &s;ingular learning and fidelity, or becau&s;e &s;he was willing to indulge an affected fit of indignation again&s;t the ob|ject of her capricious pa&s;&s;ion, that when Sackville, in 1591, was a candidate for the chancellor&s;hip of the univer&s;ity of Oxford, &s;he conde&s;cended earne&s;tly to &s;ollicit the univer&s;ity in his favour, and in oppo&s;ition to his competitor the earl of E&s;&s;ex.

<P>About the year 1557, he formed the plan of a poem, in which all the illu&s;trious but unfortunate characters of the Eng|li&s;h hi&s;tory, from the conque&s;t to the end of the fourteenth century, were to pa&s;s in review before the poet, who de&s;cends like Dante into the infernal region, and is conducted by SORROW. Although a de&s;cent into hell had been &s;ugge&s;ted by other poets, the application of &s;uch a fiction to the pre&s;ent de&s;ign, is a con&s;picuous proof of genius and even of invention. Every per&s;onage was to recite his own misfortunes in a &s;eparate &s;oliloquy. But Sackville had lei&s;ure only to fini&s;h a poetical preface called an INDUCTION, and one legend, which is the life of Henry Stafford duke of Buckingham. Relinqui&s;hing therefore the de&s;ign abruptly, and ha&s;tily adapting the clo&s;e of his INDUCTION to the appearance of Buckingham, the only &s;tory he had yet written, and which was to have been the la&s;t in his &s;eries, he recommended the completion of the whole to Richard Baldwyne and George Ferrers.</P>

<P>I have not time to follow Dante regularly through his dia|logues and adventures with the crouds of gho&s;ts, antient and modern, which he meets in the cour&s;e of this infernal journey. In the&s;e interviews, there is often much of the party and poli|tics of his own times, and of allu&s;ion to recent facts. Nor have I lei&s;ure particularly to di&s;play our author's puni&s;hments and phantoms. I ob&s;erve in general, that the ground-work of his hell is cla&s;&s;ical, yet with many Gothic and extravagant innova|tions. The burning lakes, the fo&s;&s;es, and fiery towers which &s;urround the city of DIS, and the three Furies which wait at its entrance, are touched with new &s;trokes <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">See CANT. ix. vii.</NOTE>. The Gorgons, the Hydra, the Chimera, Cerberus, the &s;erpent of Lerna, and the re&s;t of Virgil's, or rather Homer's, infernal apparitions, are dilated with new touches of the terrible, and &s;ometimes made ridiculous by the addition of comic or incongruous circum|&s;tances, yet without any intention of burle&s;que. Becau&s;e Virgil had mentioned the Harpies in a &s;ingle word only <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Gorgones, HARPYIAEQUE. vi. 289.</NOTE>, in one of the loth&s;ome groves which Dante pa&s;&s;es, con&s;i&s;ting of trees who&s;e leaves are black, and who&s;e knotted boughs are hard as iron, the Harpies build their ne&s;ts <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">CANT. xiii.</NOTE>.</P>

It is &s;uppo&s;ed that Dante took the idea of his INFERNO from a magnificent nightly repre&s;entation of hell, ex|hibited by the pope in honour of the bi&s;hop of O&s;tia on the river Arno at Florence, in the year 1304. This is mentioned by the Italian critics in extenuation of Dante's choice of &s;o &s;trange a &s;ubject. But why &s;hould we attempt to excu&s;e any ab&s;urdity in the writings or manners of the middle ages? Dante cho&s;e this &s;ubject as a reader of Virgil and Homer. The religious MYSTERY repre&s;ented on the river Arno, however magnificent, was perhaps a &s;pectacle purely orthodox, and perfectly conform|able to the ideas of the church. And if we allow that it might hint the &s;ubject, with all its incon&s;i&s;tencies, it never could have furni&s;hed any con&s;iderable part of this wonderful compound of cla&s;|&s;ical and romantic fancy, of pagan and chri&s;tian theology, of real and fictitious hi&s;tory, of tragical and comic incidents, of fami|liar and heroic manners, and of &s;atirical and &s;ublime poetry. But the gro&s;&s;e&s;t improprieties of this poem di&s;cover an origina|lity of invention, and its ab&s;urdities often border on &s;ublimity. We are &s;urpri&s;ed that a poet &s;hould write one hundred cantos on hell, paradi&s;e, and purgatory. But this prolixity is partly owing to the want of art and method: and is common to all early compo&s;itions, in which every thing is related circum&s;tantially and without rejection, and not in tho&s;e general terms which are u&s;ed by modern writers.</P>

<P>In the Fields inhabited by unhappy lovers he &s;ees Semiramis, Achilles, Paris, and Tri&s;tan, or &s;ir Tri&s;tram.

<P>Among many others of his friends, he &s;ees Franci&s;ca the daughter of Guido di Polenta, in who&s;e palace Dante died at Ravenna, and Paulo one of the &s;ons of Malate&s;ta lord of Rimini. This lady fell in love with Paulo; the pa&s;&s;ion was mutual, and &s;he was betrothed to him in marriage: but her family cho&s;e rather that &s;he &s;hould be married to Lanciotto, Paulo's elde&s;t brother. This match had the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences. The injured lovers could not di&s;&s;emble or &s;tifle their affection: they were &s;urpri&s;ed, and both a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by Lanciotto. Dante finds the &s;hades of the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed victims of an unfortunate attachment at a di&s;tance from the re&s;t, in a region of his IN|FERNO de&s;olated by the mo&s;t violent tempe&s;ts. He acco&s;ts them both, and Franci&s;ca relates their hi&s;tory: yet the conver&s;ation is carried on with &s;ome difficulty, on account of the impetuo&s;ity of the &s;torm which was perpetually raging. Dante, who from many circum&s;tances of his own amours, appears to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t refined &s;en&s;ibilities about the delicacies of love, en|quires in what manner, when in the other world, they fir&s;t com|municated their pa&s;&s;ion to each other.

their yet undi&s;covered feelings.

It is not improbable, that the &s;hades of unfortunate men, who de&s;cribed under peculiar &s;ituations and with their proper attributes, are introduced relating at large their hi&s;tories in hell to Dante, might have given the hint to Boccace's book DE CASIBUS VIRORUM ILLUSTRIUM, On the Misfortunes of Illu&s;trious Per&s;onages, the original model of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES.</P>
<P>Dante's PURGATORY is not on the whole le&s;s fanta&s;tic than his HELL. As his hell was a va&s;t perpendicular cavity in the earth, he &s;uppo&s;es Purgatory to be a cylindric ma&s;s elevated to a prodigious height. At intervals are rece&s;&s;es projecting from the out&s;ide of the cylinder. In the&s;e rece&s;&s;es, &s;ome higher and &s;ome lower, the wicked expiate their crimes, according to the proportion of their guilt. From one department they pa&s;s to another by &s;teps of &s;tone exceedingly &s;teep. On the top of the whole, or the &s;ummit of Purgatory, is a plat-form adorned with trees and vegetables of every kind. This is the Terre&s;trial Para|di&s;e, which has been tran&s;ported hither we know not how, and which forms an avenue to the Paradi&s;e Cele&s;tial. It is extraor|dinary that &s;ome of the Gothic painters &s;hould not have given us this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Dante de&s;cribes not di&s;agreeably the fir&s;t region which he traver&s;es on leaving Hell. The heavens are tinged with &s;apphire, and the &s;tar of love, or the &s;un, makes all the orient laugh. He &s;ees a venerable &s;age approach. This is Cato of Utica, who, a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee a living man in the man&s;ion of gho&s;ts, que&s;tions Dante and Virgil about the bu&s;ine&s;s which brought them hither. <NOTE PLACE="foot">^y PURGAT. CANT. i.</NOTE>
<PB N="252" REF="356">
Virgil an&s;wers: and Cato advi&s;es Virgil to wa&s;h Dante's face, which was &s;oiled with the &s;moak of hell, and to cover his head with one of the reeds which grew on the borders of the neigh|bouring river. Virgil takes his advice; and having gathered one reed, &s;ees another &s;pring up in its place. This is the golden bough of the Eneid, <HI>uno avul&s;o non deficit alter.</HI> The &s;hades al&s;o, as in Virgil, croud to be ferried over Styx: but an angel performs the office of Charon, admitting &s;ome into the boat, and rejecting others. This confu&s;ion of fable and religion de&s;troys the graces of the one and the maje&s;ty of the other.</P>
<P>Through adventures and &s;cenes more &s;trange and wild than any in the Pilgrim's Progre&s;s, we at length arrive at the twenty|fir&s;t Canto. A concu&s;&s;ion of the earth announces the delive|rance of a &s;oul from Purgatory. This is the &s;oul of Statius, the favorite poet of the dark ages. Although a very improper companion for Virgil, he immediately joins our adventurers, and accompanies them in their progre&s;s. It is difficult to di&s;cover what pagan or chri&s;tian idea regulates Dante's di&s;pen&s;ation of rewards and puni&s;hments. Statius pa&s;&s;es from Purgatory to Pa|radi&s;e, Cato remains in the place of expiation, and Virgil is condemned to eternal torments.</P>
<P>Dante meets his old acquaintance Fore&s;e, a debauchee of Flo|rence. On fini&s;hing the conver&s;ation, Fore&s;e a&s;ks Dante when he &s;hall have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him again. This que&s;tion in Purgatory is diverting enough. Dante an&s;wers with much &s;erious gravity, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know not the time of death: but it cannot be too near. Look back on the troubles in which my country is involved <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">CANT. xxiv.</NOTE>!"</Q> The di&s;pute between the pontificate and the empire, appears to have been the predominant topic of Dante's mind. This circum&s;tance has filled Dante's poem with &s;trokes of &s;atire. Every reader of Voltaire mu&s;t remember that lively writer's paraphra&s;e from the INFERNO, of the &s;tory of count Guido, in which are the&s;e inimitable lines.

<P>Dante thus tran&s;lated would have had many more readers than at pre&s;ent. I take this opportunity of remarking, that our au|thor's perpetual reference to recent facts and characters is in imi|tation of Virgil, yet with this very material difference. The per&s;ons recogni&s;ed in Virgil's &s;ixth book, for in&s;tance the chiefs of the Trojan war, are the cotemporaries of the hero not of the poet. The truth is, Dante's poem is a &s;atirical hi&s;tory of his own times.</P>
<P>Dante &s;ees &s;ome of the gho&s;ts of Purgatory advancing for|ward, more meagre and emaciated than the re&s;t. He a&s;ks how this could happen in a place where all live alike without nou|ri&s;hment. Virgil quotes the example of Meleager, who wa&s;ted with a firebrand, on the gradual extinction of which his life de|pended. He al&s;o produces the compari&s;on of a mirror reflecting a figure. The&s;e ob&s;cure explications do not &s;atisfy the doubts of Dante. Statius, for his better in&s;truction, explains how a child grows in the womb of the mother, how it is enlarged, and by degrees receives life and intellect. The drift of our
<PB N="254" REF="358">
author is apparent in the&s;e profound illu&s;trations. He means to &s;hew his &s;kill in a &s;ort of metaphy&s;ical anatomy. We &s;ee &s;ome|thing of this in the TESORETTO of Brunetto. Unintelligible &s;olutions of a &s;imilar &s;ort, drawn from a frivolous and my&s;terious philo&s;ophy, mark the writers of Dante's age.</P>
<P>The PARADISE of Dante, the third part of this poem, re|&s;embles his PURGATORY. Its fictions, and its allegories which &s;uffer by being explained, are all conceived in the &s;ame chimerical &s;pirit. The poet &s;ucce&s;&s;ively views the glory of the &s;aints, of angels, of the holy Virgin, and at la&s;t of God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Heaven as well as hell, among the monks, had its legendary de&s;cription; which it was here&s;y to di&s;believe, and which was formed on perver&s;ions or mi&s;interpretations of &s;cripture. Our author's vi&s;ion ends with the deity, and we know not by what miraculous a&s;&s;i&s;tance he returns to earth.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allowed, that the &s;cenes of Virgil's &s;ixth book have many fine &s;trokes of the terrible. But Dante's colouring is of a more gloomy temperature. There is a &s;ombrous ca&s;t in his imagination: and he has given new &s;hades of horror to the cla&s;&s;ical hell. We may &s;ay of Dante, that
<Q><L>&mdash;Hell</L>
<L>Grows DARKER at his FROWN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">PAR. L. ii. 720.</NOTE>.&mdash;</L></Q>
The &s;en&s;ations of fear impre&s;&s;ed by the Roman poet are le&s;s harra&s;&s;ing to the repo&s;e of the mind: they have a more equable and placid effect. The terror of Virgil's tremendous objects is dimini&s;hed by correctne&s;s of compo&s;ition and elegance of &s;tyle. We are reconciled to his Gorgons and Hydras, by the grace of expre&s;&s;ion, and the charms of ver&s;ification.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it may &s;eem a matter of &s;urpri&s;e, that the Italian poets of the thirteenth century who re&s;tored, ad|mired, and &s;tudied the cla&s;&s;ics, did not imitate their beauties. But while they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the genuine models of antiquity, their
<PB N="255" REF="359">
unnatural and eccentric habits of mind and manners, their at|tachments to &s;y&s;tem, their &s;chola&s;tic theology, &s;uper&s;tition, ideal love, and above all their chivalry, had corrupted every true princi|ple of life and literature, and con&s;equently prevented the progre&s;s of ta&s;te and propriety. They could not conform to the practices and notions of their own age, and to the ideas of the antients, at the &s;ame time. They were dazzled with the imageries of Virgil and Homer, which they could not always under&s;tand or apply: or which they &s;aw through the mi&s;t of prejudice and mi&s;conception. Their genius having once taken a fal&s;e direc|tion, when recalled to copy a ju&s;t pattern, produced only con|&s;traint and affectation, a di&s;torted and unplea&s;ing re&s;emblance. The early Italian poets disfigured, in&s;tead of adorning thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> works, by attempting to imitate the cla&s;&s;ics. The charms which we &s;o much admire in Dante, do not belong to the Greeks and Romans. They are derived from another origin, and mu&s;t be traced back to a different &s;tock. Nor is it at the &s;ame time le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing, that the later Italian poets, in more enlightened times, &s;hould have paid &s;o re&s;pectful a compliment to Dante as to acknowledge no other model, and with his excellencies, to tran&s;cribe and perpetuate all his extravagancies.</P>

<P>I NOW return to the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES, and to Sackville's Legend of Buckingham, which follows his INDUCTION.</P>
<P><HI>The Complaynt of</HI> HENRYE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM, is writ|ten with a force and even elegance of expre&s;&s;ion, a copiou&s;ne&s;s of phra&s;eology, and an exactne&s;s of ver&s;ification, not to be found in any other parts of the collection. On the whole, it may be thought tedious and languid. But that objection unavoidably re&s;ults from the general plan of the&s;e pieces. It is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;oliloquies of &s;uch prolixity, and de&s;igned to include much hi&s;|torical and even biographical matter, &s;hould every where &s;u&s;tain a proper degree of &s;pirit, pathos, and intere&s;t. In the exor|dium are the&s;e nervous and correct couplets.

<P>Many compari&s;ons are introduced by the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;peaker. But it is common for the be&s;t poets to forget that they are de|&s;cribing what is only related or &s;poken.

<P>Buckingham in his reproaches again&s;t the traiterous behaviour of his antient friend Bana&s;tre, utters this forcible exclamation, which breathes the genuine &s;pirit of revenge, and is unloaded with poetical &s;uperfluities.</P>

<P>If internal evidence was not a proof, we are &s;ure from other evidences that Shake&s;peare's tragedy preceded Niccols's legend. The tragedy was written about 1597. Niccols, at eighteen years of age, was admitted into Magdalene college in Oxford, in the year 1602 <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Regi&s;tr. Univ. Oxon. He retired to Magdalene Hall, where he was graduated in Arts, 1606. Ibid.</NOTE>. It is ea&s;y to point out other marks of imitation. Shake&s;peare has taken nothing from Seagars's Ri|chard the third, printed in Baldwine's collection, or fir&s;t edition, in the year 1559. Shake&s;peare, however, probably catched the idea of the royal &s;hades, in the &s;ame &s;cene of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> tragedy be|fore us, appearing in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and &s;peaking to Richard and

<P>To this reign I a&s;&s;ign Richard Edwards, a native of Somer|&s;et&s;hire about the year 1523.

<P>He was born of an antient family, about the year 1523, at Rivenhall in E&s;&s;ex; and was placed as a chori&s;ter, or &s;inging|boy, in the collegiate chapel of the ca&s;tle of Wallingford in Berk&s;hire <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This chapel had a dean, &s;ix preben|daries, &s;ix clerks, and four chori&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ers. It was di&s;&s;olved in 1549.</NOTE>. Having a fine voice, he was impre&s;&s;ed from Wal|lingford college into the king's chapel. Soon afterwards he was admitted into the choir of &s;aint Paul's cathedral in London; where he made great improvements under the in&s;truction of John Redford the organi&s;t, a famous mu&s;ician. He was next &s;ent to Eton-&s;chool, where, at one cha&s;ti&s;ement, he received fifty-three &s;tripes of the rod, from the &s;evere but celebrated ma&s;ter Nicholas Udall <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Udall's Engli&s;h interludes, mentioned above, were perhaps written for his &s;cho|lars.

In this de|partment he lived ten years: but being di&s;gu&s;ted with the vices, and wearied with the quarrels of the courtiers, he retired into the country, and embraced the profe&s;&s;ion of a farmer, which he &s;ucce&s;&s;ively practi&s;ed at Ratwood in Su&s;&s;ex, Ip&s;wich in Suffolk, Fair&s;tead in E&s;&s;ex, Norwich, and other places <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In Peacham's MINERVA, a book of emblems printed in 1612, there is the de|vice of a whet&s;tone and a &s;cythe with the&s;e lines, fol. 61. edit. 4to.

<P>Before I proceed, I mu&s;t &s;ay a few words concerning the very remarkable practice implied in the&s;e &s;tanzas, of &s;eizing boys by a warrant for the &s;ervice of the king's chapel.

<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that this old Engli&s;h georgic has much more of the &s;implicity of He&s;iod, than of the elegance of Virgil: and a modern reader would &s;u&s;pect, that many of its &s;alutary maxims originally decorated the margins, and illu&s;|trated the calendars, of an antient almanac.

Catha|rine had certainly the patience and conjugal compliance of Gri|&s;ild: but Henry's cruelty was not, like Walter's, only artificial and a&s;&s;umed.

<P>IT appears, however, that the cultivation of an Engli&s;h &s;tyle began to be now regarded. At the general re&s;toration of knowledge and ta&s;te, it was a great impediment to the progre&s;s of our language, that all the learned and ingenious, aiming at the character of erudition, wrote in Latin. Engli&s;h books were written only by the &s;uperficial and illiterate, at a time when judgment and genius &s;hould have been exerted in the nice and critical ta&s;k of poli&s;hing a rude &s;peech. Long after the inven|tion of typography, our vernacular &s;tyle, in&s;tead of being &s;trengthened and refined by numerous compo&s;itions, was only corrupted with new barbari&s;ms and affectations, for want of able and judicious writers in Engli&s;h. Unle&s;s we except &s;ir Thomas More, who&s;e DIALOGUE ON TRIBULATION, and HISTORY OF RICHARD THE THIRD, were e&s;teemed &s;tandards of &s;tyle &s;o low as the reign of James the fir&s;t, Roger A&s;cham was perhaps the fir&s;t of our &s;cholars who ventured to break the &s;hackles of Latinity, by publi&s;hing his TOXOPHILUS in Engli&s;h; chiefly with a view of giving a pure and correct model of Engli&s;h compo&s;ition, or rather of &s;hewing how a &s;ubject might be treated with grace and propriety in En<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">li&s;h as well as in Latin. His own vindication of his conduct in attempting this great innova|tion is too &s;en&s;ible to be omitted, and reflects light on the revo|lutions of our poetry. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As for the Lattine or Greeke tongue, euerye thinge is &s;o excellentlye done in Them, that none can do better.

Leonarde Cox, a &s;choolma&s;ter, patroni&s;ed by Farringdon the la&s;t abbot of Reading, had publi&s;hed in 1530, as I have ob&s;erved, an Engli&s;h tract on rhetoric, which is nothing more than a technical and elementary man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">al.

<P>I mu&s;t premi&s;e, that Wil&s;on, one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed &s;cholars of his times, was originally a fellow of King's Col|lege <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Admitted &s;cholar in 1541. A native of Lincoln&s;hire. MS. Hatcher.</NOTE>, where he was tutor to the two celebrated youths Henry and Charles Brandon dukes of Suffolk. Being a doctor of laws, he was afterwards one of the ordinary ma&s;ters of reque&s;ts, ma&s;ter of &s;aint Katharine's ho&s;pital near the Tower, a frequent emba&s;|&s;ador from queen Eli&s;abeth to Mary queen of Scots, and into the Low countries, a &s;ecretary of &s;tate and a privy coun&s;ellor, and at length, in 1579, dean of Durham. He died in 1581. His remarkable diligence and di&s;patch in negotiation is &s;aid to have re&s;ulted from an uncommon &s;trength of memory. It is another proof of his attention to the advancement of our Engli&s;h &s;tyle, that he tran&s;lated &s;even orations of Demo&s;thenes, which, in 1570, he dedicated to &s;ir William Cecill <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Which had b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">en al&s;o tran&s;lated into Latin by Nicholas Carr.

<P>But the French had even an ART OF POETRY &s;o early as the year 1548.

This piece pre&s;erves many valuable anecdotes of the old French poetry: and, among other particulars which develope the &s;tate of the old French drama, has the following &s;en&s;ible &s;trictures. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The French farce contains little or nothing of the Latin comedy. It has neither acts nor &s;cenes, which would only &s;erve to introduce a tedious prolixity: for the true &s;ubject of the French farce, or SOTTIE, is every &s;ort of foolery which has a tendency to provoke laughter.&mdash;The &s;ubject of the Greek and Latin comedy was totally different from every thing on the French &s;tage.

this mu&s;t be re&s;tricted to the courtiers of Edward the &s;ixth.

<P>The&s;e are the circum&s;tances of the fable of this tragedy. Gordobuc, a king of Britain about &s;ix hundred years before Chri&s;t, made in his life-time a divi&s;ion of his kingdom to his &s;ons Ferrex and Porrex. The two young princes within five years quarrelled for univer&s;al &s;overeignty. A civil was en&s;ued, and Porrex <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lew his elder brother Ferrex.

The nobility then a&s;&s;embled, collected an army, and de&s;troyed the
<PB N="358" REF="460">
rebels. An inte&s;tine war commenced between the chief lords: the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown became uncertain and arbitrary, for want of the lineal royal i&s;&s;ue: and the country, de&s;titute of a king, and wa&s;ted by dome&s;tic &s;laughter, was reduced to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t mi&s;erable de&s;olation.</P>
<P>In the dramatic conduct of this tale, the unities of time and place are eminently and vi&s;ibly violated: a defect which Shake|&s;peare &s;o frequently commits, but which he covers by the magic of his poetry. The greater part of this long and eventful hi&s;tory is included in the repre&s;entation. But in a &s;tory &s;o fertile of blood&s;hed, no murther is committed on the &s;tage. It is worthy of remark, that the death of Porrex in the bed-chamber is only related. Perhaps the players had not yet learned to die, nor was the ponyard &s;o e&s;&s;ential an article as at pre&s;ent among the im|plements of the property-room. Nor is it improbable, that to kill a man on the &s;tage was not now avoided as a &s;pectacle &s;hocking to humanity, but becau&s;e it was difficult and incon|venient to be repre&s;ented. The writer has followed the &s;eries of facts related in the chronicles without any material varia|tion, or fictitious embarra&s;&s;ments, and with the addition only of a few nece&s;&s;ary and obvious characters.</P>
<P>There is a Chorus of Four Antient and Sage Men of Britain, who regularly clo&s;e every Act, the la&s;t excepted, with an ode in long-lined &s;tanzas, drawing back the attention of the au|dience to the &s;ub&s;tance of what has ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, and illu&s;trating it by recapitulatory moral reflections, and poetical or hi&s;torical allu&s;ions.

<P>Every Act is introduced, as was the cu&s;tom in our old plays, with a piece of machinery called the DUMB SHOW, &s;hadowing by an allegorical exhibition the matter that was immediately to follow. In the con&s;truction of this &s;pectacle and its per&s;oni|fications, much poetry and imagination was often di&s;played. It is &s;ome apology for the&s;e prefigurations, that they were com|monly too my&s;terious and ob&s;cure, to fore&s;tal the future events with any degree of clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion. Not that this mute mimicry was always typical of the en&s;uing incidents. It &s;ome|times &s;erved for a compendious introduction of &s;uch circum|&s;tances, as could not commodiou&s;ly be comprehended within the bounds of the repre&s;entation. It &s;ometimes &s;upplied deficien|cies, and covered the want of bu&s;ine&s;s. Our ance&s;tors were ea&s;ily &s;atified with this artificial &s;upplement of one of the mo&s;t important unities, which abundantly filled up the interval that was nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s, while a hero was expected from the Holy Land, or a prince&s;s was imported, married, and brought to bed.
<PB N="361" REF="463">
mean time, the greater part of the audience were probably more plea&s;ed with the emblematical pageantry than the poetical dia|logue, although both were alike unintelligible.</P>
<P>I will give a &s;pecimen in the DOMME SHEWE preceding the fourth act. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fir&s;t, the mu&s;ick of howeboies began to plaie. Duringe whiche, there came forth from vnder the &s;tage, as thoughe out of hell, three Furies, ALECTO, MEGERA, and CTESIPHONE <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ti&s;iphone.</NOTE>, clad in blacke garments &s;prinkled with bloud and flames, their bodies girt with &s;nakes, their heds &s;pread with &s;erpents in&s;tead of heare, the one bearing in her hande <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;nake the other a whip, and the thirde a burning firebrande: eche driuynge before them a kynge and a queene, which moued by Furies vnnaturally had &s;laine their owne children. The names of the kinges and queenes were the&s;e, TANTALUS, MEDEA, ATHAMAS, INO, CAMBISES, ALTHEA. After that the Furies, and the&s;e, had pa&s;&s;ed aboute the &s;tage thri&s;e, they departed, and then the mu&s;icke cea&s;ed. Hereby was &s;ignified the vnnaturall murders to followe, that is to &s;aie, Porrex &s;laine by his owne mother. And of king Gordobuc and queene Viden killed by their owne &s;ubjectes."</Q> Here, by the way, the vi&s;ionary proce&s;&s;ion of kings and queens long &s;ince dead, evidently re&s;embles our author Sackville's original model of the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES; and, for the &s;ame rea|&s;on, reminds us of a &s;imilar train of royal &s;pectres in the tent|&s;cene of Shake&s;peare's KING RICHARD THE THIRD.</P>
<P>I take this opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing my &s;urpri&s;e, that this o&s;ten&s;ible comment of the Dumb Shew &s;hould not regularly ap|pear in the tragedies of Shake&s;peare. There are even proofs that he treated it with contempt and ridicule. Although &s;ome critics are of opinion, that becau&s;e it is never de&s;cribed in form at the clo&s;e or commencement of his acts, it was therefore never introduced. Shake&s;peare's aim was to collect an audience, and for this purpo&s;e all the common expedients were nece&s;&s;ary. No
<PB N="362" REF="464">
dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">matic writer of his age has more battles or gho&s;ts. His re|pre&s;entations abound with the u&s;ual appendages of mechanical terror, and he adopts all the &s;uper&s;titions of the theatre. This problem can only be re&s;olved into the activity or the &s;uperiority of a mind, which either would not be entangled by the forma|lity, or which &s;aw through the futility, of this unnatural and extrin&s;ic ornament. It was not by declamation or by panto|mime that Shake&s;peare was to fix his eternal dominion over the hearts of mankind.</P>
<P>To return to Sackville. That this tragedy was never a favo|rite among our ance&s;tors, and had long fallen into general obli|vion, is to be attributed to the nakedne&s;s and unintere&s;ting nature of the plot, the tedious length of the &s;peeches, the want of a di&s;crimination of character, and almo&s;t a total ab&s;ence of pathetic or critical &s;ituations. It is true that a mother kills her own &s;on. But this act of barbarous and unnatural impiety, to &s;ay nothing of its almo&s;t unexampled atrocity in the tender &s;ex, proceeds only from a brutal principle of &s;udden and impetuous revenge. It is not the con&s;equence of any deep machination, nor is it founded in a proper preparation of previous circum|&s;tances. She is never before introduced to our notice as a wicked or de&s;igning character. She murthers her &s;on Porrex, becau&s;e in the commotions of a civil di&s;&s;en&s;ion, in &s;elf-defence, after repeated provocations, and the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of the ba&s;e&s;t in|gratitude and treachery, he had &s;lain his rival brother, not with|out the deepe&s;t compunction and remor&s;e for what he had done. A mother murthering a &s;on is a fact which mu&s;t be received with horror; but it required to be complicated with other mo|tives, and prompted by a cooperation of other cau&s;es, to rou&s;e our attention, and work upon our pa&s;&s;ions. I do not mean that any other motive could have been found, to palliate a murther of &s;uch a nature. Yet it was po&s;&s;ible to heighten and to divide the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tre&s;s, by rendering this bloody mother, under the notions of human frailty, an object of our compa&s;&s;ion as well as of our abhorrence. But perhaps the&s;e artifices were not yet known
<PB N="363" REF="465">
or wanted. The general &s;tory of the play is great in its political con&s;equences; and the leading incidents are important, but not &s;ufficiently intricate to awaken our curio&s;ity, and hold us in &s;u&s;pence. Nothing is perplexed and nothing unravelled. The oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts is &s;uch as does not affect our nicer feel|ings. In the plot of a play, our plea&s;ure ari&s;es in proportion as our expectation is excited.</P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t be granted, that the language of GORDOBUC has great purity and per&s;picuity; and that it is entirely free from that tumid phra&s;eology, which does not &s;eem to have taken place till play-writing had become a trade, and our poets found it their int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;t to captivate the multitude by the fal&s;e &s;ublime, and by tho&s;e exaggerated imageries and pedantic metaphors, which are the chief blemi&s;hes of the &s;cenes of Shake&s;peare, and which are at this day mi&s;taken for his capital beauties by too many readers. Here al&s;o we perceive another and a &s;trong rea&s;on why this play was never popular.</P>
<P>Sir Philip Sydney, in his admirable DEFENCE OF POESIE, remarks, that this tragedy is full of <HI>notable moralitie.</HI> But tra|gedies are not to in&s;truct us by the intermixture of moral &s;en|tences, but by the force of example, and the effect of the &s;tory. In the fir&s;t act, the three coun&s;ellors are introduced debating about the divi&s;ion of the kingdom in long and elaborate &s;peeches, which are replete with political advice and maxims of civil prudence. But this &s;tately &s;ort of declamation, whatever elo|quence it may di&s;play, and whatever policy it may teach, is undramatic, unanimated, and unaffecting. Sentiment and argu|ment will never &s;upply the place of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tion upon the &s;tage. Not to mention, that the&s;e grave harangues have &s;ome tincture of the formal modes of addre&s;s, and the ceremonious oratory, which were then in fa&s;hion. But we mu&s;t allow, that in the &s;train of dialogue in which they are profe&s;&s;edly written, they have un|common merit, even without drawing an apology in their fa|vour from their antiquity: and that they contain much dignity, &s;trength of reflection, and good &s;en&s;e, couched in clear expre&s;&s;ion

<P>The illu&s;tration from Brutus is here both appo&s;ite and poetical.</P>
<P>Spence, with a reference to the &s;ituation of the author lord Buckhur&s;t in the court of queen Eli&s;abeth, has ob&s;erved in his preface to the modern edition of this tragedy, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"'tis no wonder, if the language of kings and &s;tate&s;men &s;hould be le&s;s happily imitated by a poet than a privy coun&s;ellor."</Q> This is an in&s;inuation that Shake&s;peare, who has left many hi&s;torical tragedies, was le&s;s able to conduct &s;ome parts of a royal &s;tory than the &s;tate&s;man lord Buckhur&s;t. But I will venture to pro|nounce, that whatever merit there is in this play, and particu|larly in the &s;peeches we have ju&s;t been examining, it is more owing to the poet than the privy coun&s;ellor. If a fir&s;t mini&s;ter was to write a tragedy, I believe the piece will be the better, the le&s;s it has of the fir&s;t mini&s;ter. When a &s;tate&s;man turns poet, I &s;hould not wi&s;h him to fetch his ideas or his language from the canbinet.

<P>As the notions of &s;ubordination, of the royal authority, and the divine in&s;titution of kings, predominated in the reign of queen Eli&s;abeth, it is extraordinary, that eight lines, inculcating in plain terms the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive and unre&s;i&s;ting obedience to the prince, which appeared in the fifth act of the fir&s;t edition of this tragedy, &s;hould have been expunged in the edition of 1571, publi&s;hed under the immediate in&s;pection of the authors <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">See Signat.

But the force of internal evidence often prevails over the authority of a&s;&s;ertion, a te&s;timony which is dimini&s;hed by time, and may be rendered &s;u&s;picious from a variety of other circum&s;tances.

<HEAD>SECT. XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>THIS appearance of a regular tragedy, with the divi&s;ion of acts and &s;cenes, and the accompaniment of the antient chorus, repre&s;ented both at the Middle-temple and at Whitehall, and written by the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed nobleman of the court of queen Eli&s;abeth, &s;eems to have directed the attention of our more learned poets to the &s;tudy of the old cla&s;&s;ical drama, and in a &s;hort time to have produced vernacular ver&s;ions of the JOCASTA of Euripides, as it is called, and of the ten Tragedies of Seneca. I do not find that it was &s;peedily followed by any original compo&s;itions on the &s;ame legitimate model.</P>
<P>The JOCASTA of Euripides was tran&s;lated by George Ga&s;|coigne and Francis Kinwelmer&s;h, both &s;tudents of Grays-inn, and acted in the refectory of that &s;ociety, in the year 1566. Ga&s;coigne tran&s;lated the &s;econd, third, and fifth acts, and Kin|welmer&s;h the fir&s;t, and fourth. It was printed in Ga&s;coigne's poems, of which more will be &s;aid hereafter, in 1577, under the following title, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"JOCASTA, a Tragedie written in Greeke by Euripides. Tran&s;lated and dige&s;ted into Acte, by George Ga&s;coigne and Francis Kinwelmer&s;he of Graies inn, and there by them pre&s;ented, An. 1566."</Q> The Epilogue was written in quatraines by Chri&s;topher Yelverton, then one of their bro|ther &s;tudents. So &s;trongly were our audiences &s;till attached to &s;pectacle, that the authors did not venture to pre&s;ent their play, without introducing a DUMB SHEW at the beginning of every act. For this, however, they had the example and authority of GORDOBUC. Some of the earlie&s;t &s;pecimens of Inigo Jones's Grecian architecture are marred by Gothic ornaments.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="477">
It mu&s;t, however, be ob&s;erved, that this is by no means a ju&s;t or exact tran&s;lation of the JOCASTA, that is the PHOENISSAE, of Euripides. It is partly a paraphra&s;e, and partly an abridge|ment, of the Greek tragedy. There are many omi&s;&s;ions, re|trenchments, and tran&s;po&s;itions. The chorus, the characters, and the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;tory, are entirely retained, and the tenor of the dialogue is often pre&s;erved through whole &s;cenes. Some of the beautiful odes of the Greek chorus are neglected, and others &s;ub&s;tituted in their places, newly written by the tran|&s;lators. In the favorite addre&s;s to Mars <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>See PHOENISS. pag. 140. edit. Barne&s;.</P>

In the be|ginning of the &s;econd act, he has added a new &s;cene, in which he introduces the &s;pectre of Achilles rai&s;ed from hell, and de|manding the &s;acrifice of Polyxena. This &s;cene, which is in the octave &s;tanza, has much of the air of one of the legends in the MIRROUR OF MAGISTRATES. To the chorus of this act, he has &s;ubjoined three &s;tanzas.

<P>It is remarkable, that Shake&s;peare has borrowed nothing from the Engli&s;h Seneca. Perhaps a copy might not fall in his way. Shake&s;peare was only a reader by accident.

The only poetical fable of antiquity, which he has worked into a play, is TROILUS. But this he borrowed from the romance of Troy. Modern fiction and Engli&s;h hi&s;tory were his principal re&s;ources. The&s;e perhaps were more &s;uitable to his ta&s;te: at lea&s;t he found that they produced the mo&s;t popular &s;ubjects.

<P>It will perhaps be &s;ufficient barely to mention Spen&s;er's CU|LEX, which is a vague and arbitrary paraphra&s;e, of a poem not properly belonging to Virgil. From the te&s;timony of many early Latin writers it may be ju&s;tly concluded, that Virgil wrote an elegant poem with this title. Nor is it improbable that in the CU<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">EX at pre&s;ent attributed to Virgil, &s;ome very few of the ori|ginal phra&s;es, and even ver&s;es, may remain, under the accumu|lated incru&s;tation of critics, imitators, interpolators, and para|phra&s;ts, which corrupts what it conceals. But the texture, the character, and &s;ub&s;tance, of the genuine poem is almo&s;t entirely lo&s;t. The CEIRIS, or the fable of Ni&s;us and Scylla, which fol|lows, although never mentioned by any writer of antiquity, has much fairer preten&s;ions to genuinene&s;s. At lea&s;t the CEIRIS, al|lowing for uncommon depravations of time and tran&s;cription, ap|pears in its pre&s;ent &s;tate to be a poem of the Augu&s;tan age, and is perhaps the identical piece dedicated to the Me&s;&s;ala who&s;e patronage it &s;olicits. It has that rotundity of ver&s;ification, which &s;eems to have been &s;tudied after the Roman poetry emerged from barbari&s;m.
<PB N="407" REF="511">
It has a general &s;implicity, and often a native &s;trength, of colouring; nor is it tinctured, except by the ca&s;ual innova|tion of grammarians, with tho&s;e &s;ophi&s;tications both of &s;enti|ment and expre&s;&s;ion, which afterwards of cour&s;e took place among the Roman poets, and which would have betrayed a re|cent forgery. It &s;eems to be the work of a young poet: but its digre&s;&s;ions and de&s;criptions which are often too prolix, are not only the marks of a young poet, but of early poetry. It is inter&s;per&s;ed with many lines, now in the Eclogues, Georgics, and Eneid. Here is an argument which &s;eems to a&s;&s;ign it to Virgil. A cotemporary poet would not have ventured to &s;teal from poems &s;o well known. It was natural, at lea&s;t allowable, for Virgil to &s;teal from a performance of his youth, on which he did not &s;et any great value, and which he did not &s;cruple to rob of a few ornaments, de&s;erving a better place. This con&s;ideration excludes Cornelius Gallus, to whom Fontanini, with much acute criti|ci&s;m, has a&s;cribed the CEIRIS. Nor, for the rea&s;on given, would Virgil have &s;tolen from Gallus. The writer has at lea&s;t the art of Virgil, in either &s;uppre&s;&s;ing, or throwing into &s;hade, the trite and unintere&s;ting incidents of the common fabulous hi&s;tory of Scylla, which were incapable of decoration, or had been preoccupied by other poets. The dialogue between the young prince&s;s Scylla, who is deeply in love, and her nur&s;e, has much of the pathos of Virgil. There are &s;ome traces which di&s;cover an imitation of Lucretius: but on the whole, the &s;truc|ture of the ver&s;es, and the predominant ca&s;t and manner of the compo&s;ition, exactly re&s;emble the ARGONAUTICA of Catullus, or the EPITHALAMIUM of PELEUS AND THETIS. I will in&s;tance in the following pa&s;&s;age, in which every thing is di&s;tinctly and circum&s;tantially touched, and in an affected pomp of numbers. He is alluding to the &s;tole of Minerva, interwoven with the battle of the giants, and exhibited at Athens in the magnificent Panathenaic fe&s;tival. The cla&s;&s;ical reader will perceive one or two interpolations: and lament, that this rich piece of embroidery

<P>The &s;ame &s;tately march of hexameters is ob&s;ervable in Tibul|lus's tedious panegyric on Me&s;&s;ala: a poem, which, if it &s;hould not be believed to be of Tibullus's hand, may at lea&s;t, from this rea&s;oning be adjudged to his age. We are &s;ure that Ca|tullus could not have been the author of the CEIRIS, as Me&s;|&s;ala, to whom it is in&s;cribed, was born but a very few years be|fore the death of Catullus. One of the chief circum&s;tances of the &s;tory is a purple lock of hair, which grew on the head of Ni&s;us king of Megara, and on the pre&s;ervation of which the &s;afety of that city, now be&s;ieged by Minos, king of Crete, en|tirely depended. Scylla, Ni&s;us's daughter, falls in love with Minos, whom &s;he &s;ees from the walls of Megara: &s;he finds means to cut off this &s;acred ringlet, the city is taken, and &s;he is married to Minos. I am of opinion that Tibullus, in the fol|lowing pa&s;&s;age, alludes to the CEIRIS, then newly publi&s;hed,

<P>My copy once belonged to Pope; in which he has noted many of Chapman's ab&s;olute interpolations, extending &s;ome|times to the length of a paragraph of twelve lines. A diligent ob&s;erver will ea&s;ily di&s;cern, that Pope was no carele&s;s reader of his rude predece&s;&s;or. Pope complains that Chapman took advan|tage of an unmea&s;ureable length of line. But in reality Pope's lines are longer than Chapman's. If Chapman affected the re|putation of rendering line for line, the &s;pecious expedient of chu&s;ing a protracted mea&s;ure which concatenated two lines toge|ther, undoubtedly favoured his u&s;ual propen&s;ity to periphra&s;is.</P>
<P>Chapman's commentary is only incidental, contains but a &s;mall degree of critical excur&s;ion, and is for the mo&s;t part a pe|dantic compilation from Spondanus. He has the boldne&s;s &s;everely to cen&s;ure Scaliger's impertinence. It is remarkable that he has taken no illu&s;trations from Eu&s;tathius, except through the cita|tions of other commentators.

<P>From the title of this work, ZODIACUS VITAE, written in Latin hexameters by Marcello Palingeni, an Italian, about the year 1531, the reader at lea&s;t expects &s;ome a&s;tronomical allu&s;ions. But it has not the mo&s;t di&s;tant connection with the &s;tars: except that the poet is once tran&s;ported to the moon, not to mea&s;ure her diameter, but for a moral purpo&s;e; and that he once takes occa&s;ion, in his general &s;urvey of the world, and in reference to his title, to introduce a philo&s;ophic explanation of the zodiacal &s;y&s;tem <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">B. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i.

&s;igns: ju&s;t as Herodotus, but with le&s;s affectation and incon|&s;i&s;tency, marked the nine books or divi&s;ions of his hi&s;tory with the names of the nine Mu&s;es. Yet &s;o &s;trange and pedantic a title is not totally without a conceit, as the author was born at Stellada, or Stellata, a province of Ferrara, and from whence he calls him&s;elf Marcellus Palingenius Stellatus <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">It &s;hould have been STELLATENSIS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This poem is a general &s;atire on life, yet without peevi&s;hne&s;s or malevolence; and with more of the &s;olemnity of the cen&s;or, than the petulance of the &s;atiri&s;t. Much of the morality is couched under allegorical per&s;onages and adventures. The Latinity is tolerably pure, but there is a mediocrity in the ver&s;i|fication. Palingenius's tran&s;itions often di&s;cover more quickne&s;s of imagination, and fertility of reflection, than &s;olidity of judg|ment. Having &s;tarted a topic, he pur&s;ues it through all its po&s;&s;ible affinities, and deviates into the mo&s;t di&s;tant and unnece&s;|&s;ary digre&s;&s;ions. Yet there is a facility in his manner, which is not always unplea&s;ing: nor is the general conduct of the work void of art and method. He morali&s;es with a boldne&s;s and a liberality of &s;entiment, which were then unu&s;ual; and his maxims and &s;trictures are &s;ometimes tinctured with a &s;pirit of libertini&s;m, which, without expo&s;ing the opinions, mu&s;t have offended the gravity, of the more orthodox eccle&s;ia&s;tics. He fancies that a confident philo&s;opher, who ra&s;hly pre&s;umes to &s;crutini&s;e the remote my&s;teries of nature, is &s;hewn in heaven like an ape, for the public diver&s;ion of the gods. A thought evidently borrowed by Pope <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See ESSAY ON POPE, p. 94.</NOTE>. Although he &s;ubmits his per|formance to the &s;entence of the church, he treats the authority of the popes, and the voluptuous lives of the monks, with the &s;evere&s;t acrimony. It was the la&s;t circum&s;tance that chiefly con|tributed to give this poem almo&s;t the rank of a cla&s;&s;ic in the re|formed countries, and probably produced an early Engli&s;h tran|&s;lation. After his death, he was pronounced an heretic; and his body was taken up, and committed to the flames. A mea&s;ure

<P>One cannot but remark, that the conduct and machinery of the old vi&s;ionary poems is commonly the &s;ame. A rural &s;cene, generally a wilderne&s;s, is &s;uppo&s;ed. An imaginary being of con|&s;ummate wi&s;dom, a hermit, a godde&s;s, or an angel, appears; and having purged the poet's eye with a few drops of &s;ome cele&s;tial elixir, conducts him to the top of an inacce&s;&s;ible moun|tain, which commands an unbounded plain filled with all na|tions. A cavern opens, and di&s;plays the torments of the damned: he next is introduced into heaven, by way of the moon, the
<PB N="457" REF="561">
only planet which was thought big enough for a poetical vi&s;it. Although &s;uddenly de&s;erted by his my&s;tic intelligencer, he finds him&s;elf weary and de&s;olate, on the &s;ea-&s;hore, in an impa&s;&s;able fore&s;t, or a flowery meadow.</P>
<P>The following is the pa&s;&s;age which Pope has copied from Palingenius: and as Pope was a great reader of the old Engli&s;h poets, it is mo&s;t probable that he took it immediately from our tran&s;lator, or found it by his direction <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Pope's lines are almo&s;t too well-known to be tran&s;cribed.

u&s;ele&s;s &s;ubtlety, of method which cannot be applied to practice, and of that affectation of unnece&s;&s;ary deduction and frivolous in|ve&s;tigation, which characteri&s;es the philo&s;ophy of the Greeks, and which is con&s;picuous not only in the demon&s;trations of Euclid, but in the Socratic di&s;putations recorded by Xenophon.

<P>BUT the ardour of tran&s;lation was not now circum&s;cribed within the bounds of the cla&s;&s;ics, whether poets, hi&s;to|rians, orators, or critics, of Greece and Rome.</P>
<P>I have before ob&s;erved, that with our frequent tours through Italy, and our affectation of Italian manners, about the middle of the &s;ixteenth century, the Italian poets became fa&s;hionable, and that this circum&s;tance, for a time at lea&s;t, gave a new turn to our poetry. The Italian poets, however, were but in few hands; and a practice of a more popular and general nature, yet &s;till re&s;ulting from our communications with Italy, now began to prevail, which produced &s;till greater revolutions. This was the tran&s;lation of Italian books, chiefly on fictitious and nar|rative &s;ubjects, into Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The learned A&s;cham thought this novelty in our literature too important to be pa&s;&s;ed over without ob&s;ervation, in his reflec|tions on the cour&s;e of an ingenuous education. It will be much to our purpo&s;e to tran&s;cribe what he has &s;aid on this &s;ubject: although I think his arguments are more like the rea&s;onings of a rigid puritan, than of a man of liberal views and true penetration; and that he endeavours to account for the origin, and to &s;tate the con&s;equences, of the&s;e tran&s;lations, more in the &s;pirit of an early calvini&s;tic preacher, than as a &s;en&s;ible critic or a polite &s;cholar. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The&s;e be the inchauntments of Circe, brought out of Italie to marre mens manners in England: much, by example of ill life, but more by precepts of fonde bookes, of late tran|&s;lated oute of Italian into Engli&s;h, &s;olde in euery &s;hop in London, commended by hone&s;t titles, the &s;ooner to corrupt

<P>A&s;cham talkes here exactly in the &s;tyle of Prynne's HISTRIO|MASTIX. It mu&s;t indeed be confe&s;&s;ed, that by the&s;e books many pernicious ob&s;cenities were circulated, and perhaps the doctrine of intrigue more accurately taught and exemplified than before. But every advantage is attended with its inconveniencies and abu&s;es. That to procure tran&s;lations of Italian tales was a plot of the papi&s;ts, either for the purpo&s;e of facilitating the pro|pagation of their opinions, of polluting the minds of our youth, or of diffu&s;ing a &s;pirit of &s;ceptici&s;m, I am by no means con|vinced. But I have nothing to do with the moral effects of the&s;e ver&s;ions. I mean only to &s;hew their influence on our literature, more particularly on our poetry, although I re&s;erve the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this point for a future &s;ection. At pre&s;ent, my de&s;ign is to give the reader a full and uniform view of the chief of the&s;e tran&s;lations from the Italian, which appeared in England before the year 1600.</P>
<P>I will begin with Boccace. The reader recollects Boccace's THESEID and TROILUS, many of his Tales, and large pa&s;&s;ages from Petrarch and Dante, tran&s;lated by Chaucer. But the golden mine of Italian fiction opened by Chaucer, was &s;oon clo&s;ed and forgotten. I mu&s;t however premi&s;e, that the Italian language now began to grow &s;o fa&s;hionable, that it was explained in lexi|cons and grammars, written in Engli&s;h, and with a view to the illu&s;tration of the three principal Italian poets. So early as 1550, were publi&s;hed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Principal rules of the Italian grammar, with a dictionarie for the better vnder&s;tanding of Bocca&s;e, Petrarche, and Dante, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">thered into this tonge by William Thomas <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">In quarto, for T.

<P>It mu&s;t not be forgot, that Sachetti publi&s;hed tales before Boc|cace. But the publication of Boccace's DECAMERON gave a &s;tabi|lity to this mode of compo&s;ition, which had exi&s;ted in a rude &s;tate before the revival of letters in Italy. Boccace collected the com|mon tales of his country, and procured others of Grecian origin from his friends and preceptors the Con&s;tantinopolitan exiles, which he decorated with new circum&s;tances, and delivered in the pure&s;t &s;tyle. Some few perhaps are of his own invention. He was &s;oon imitated, yet often un&s;ucce&s;sfully, by many of his countrymen, Poggio, Bandello, the anonymous author of LE CIENTO NOVELLE ANTIKE, Cinthio, Firenzuola, Male&s;pini, and others. Even Machiavel, who united the livelie&s;t wit with the profounde&s;t reflection, and who compo&s;ed two comedies while he was compiling a political hi&s;tory of his country, con|de&s;cended to adorn this fa&s;hionable &s;pecies of writing with his NOVELLA DI BELFEGOR, or the tale of Belphegor.</P>

I was informed by the late Mr. Collins of Chiche&s;ter, that Shake&s;peare's TEMPEST, for which no origin is yet a&s;&s;igned, was formed on this favorite ro|mance. But although this information has not proved true on examination, an u&s;eful conclu&s;ion may be drawn from it, that Shake&s;peare's &s;tory is &s;omewhere to be found in an Italian novel, at lea&s;t that the &s;tory preceded Shake&s;peare. Mr. Collins had &s;earched this &s;ubject with no le&s;s fidelity, than judgment and indu&s;try: but his memory failing in his la&s;t calamitous indi&s;po&s;ition, he probably gave me the name of one novel for another. I remem|ber he added a circum&s;tance, which may lead to a di&s;covery, that the principal character of the romance, an&s;wering to Shake|&s;peare's Pro&s;pero, was a chemical necromancer, who had bound a &s;pirit like Ariel to obey his call and perform his &s;ervices. It was a common pretence of the dealers in the occult &s;ciences to have a demon at command. At lea&s;t Aurelio, or Orelio, was probably one of the names of this romance, the production and multipli|cation of gold being the grand object of alchemy. Taken at large, the magical part of the TEMPEST is founded in that &s;ort of philo&s;ophy which was practi&s;ed by John Dee and his a&s;&s;ociates, and has been called the Ro&s;icru&s;ian. The name Ariel came from the Talmudi&s;tic my&s;teries with which the learned Jews had infected this &s;cience.</P>
<P>To this head mu&s;t al&s;o be referred, the Collections which ap|peared before 1600, of tales drawn indi&s;criminately from French and Spani&s;h, as well as Italian authors, all perhaps originally of Italian growth, and recommended by the general love of fable and fiction which now prevailed.

<P>ENOUGH has been opened of the reign of queen Eli&s;a|beth, to afford us an opportunity of forming &s;ome general reflections, tending to e&s;tabli&s;h a full e&s;timate of the genius of the poetry of that reign; and which, by drawing conclu&s;ions from what has been &s;aid, and directing the reader to what he is to expect, will at once be recapitulatory and preparatory. Such a &s;urvey perhaps might have &s;tood with more propriety as an in|troduction to this reign. But it was fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to clear the way, by many circum&s;tantial details, and the regular narration of tho&s;e particulars, which lay the foundation of principles, and &s;ugge&s;t matter for di&s;cur&s;ive ob&s;ervation. My &s;entiments on this &s;ubject &s;hall therefore compo&s;e the concluding &s;ection of the pre&s;ent volume.</P>
<P>The age of queen Eli&s;abeth is commonly called the golden age of Engli&s;h poetry. It certainly may not improperly be &s;tyled the mo&s;t POETICAL age of the&s;e annals.</P>
<P>Among the great features which &s;trike us in the poetry of this period, are the predominancy of fable, of fiction, and fancy, and a predilection for intere&s;ting adventures and pathetic events. I will endeavour to a&s;&s;ign and explain the cau&s;e of this charac|teri&s;tic di&s;tinction, which may chiefly be referred to the follow|ing principles, &s;ometimes blended, and &s;ometimes operating &s;ingly: The revival and vernacular ver&s;ions of the cla&s;&s;ics, the importation and tran&s;lation of Italian novels, the vi&s;ionary reve|ries or refinements of fal&s;e philo&s;ophy, a degree of &s;uper|&s;tition &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of poetry, the adoption of
<PB N="491" REF="595">
the machineries of romance, and the frequency and improve|ments of allegoric exhibition in the popular &s;pectacles.</P>
<P>When the corruptions and impo&s;tures of popery were abo|li&s;hed, the fa&s;hion of cultivating the Greek and Roman learning became univer&s;al: and the literary character was no longer ap|propriated to &s;cholars by profe&s;&s;ion, but a&s;&s;umed by the nobility and gentry. The eccle&s;ia&s;tics had found it their intere&s;t to keep the languages of antiquity to them&s;elves, and men were eager to know what had been &s;o long injuriou&s;ly concealed. Truth propagates truth, and the mantle of my&s;tery was removed not only from religion but from literature. The laity, who had now been taught to a&s;&s;ert their natural privileges, became impa|tient of the old monopoly of knowledge, and demanded admit|tance to the u&s;urpations of the clergy. The general curio&s;ity for new di&s;coveries, heightened either by ju&s;t or imaginary ideas of the trea&s;ures contained in the Greek and Roman writers, ex|cited all per&s;ons of lei&s;ure and fortune to &s;tudy the cla&s;&s;ics. The pedantry of the pre&s;ent age was the politene&s;s of the la&s;t. An accurate comprehen&s;ion of the phra&s;eology and peculiarities of the antient poets, hi&s;torians, and orators, which yet &s;eldom went farther than a kind of technical erudition, was an indi&s;pen&s;able and almo&s;t the principal object in the circle of a gentleman's education. Every young lady of fa&s;hion was carefully in&s;tituted in cla&s;&s;ical letters: and the daughter of a duche&s;s was taught, not only to di&s;til &s;trong waters, but to con&s;true Greek. Among the learned females of high di&s;tinction, queen Eli&s;abeth her&s;elf was the mo&s;t con&s;picuous. Roger A&s;cham, her preceptor, &s;peaks with rapture of her a&s;toni&s;hing progre&s;s in the Greek nouns; and declares with no &s;mall degree of triumph, that during a long re&s;idence at Wind&s;or-ca&s;tle, &s;he was accu&s;tomed to read more Greek in a day, than <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;ome prebendary of that church did Latin, in one week <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">SCHOOLEMASTER. p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> 19. b. edit. 1589. 4to.</NOTE>."</Q> And although perhaps a prince&s;s looking out words in a lexicon, and writing down hard phra&s;es
<PB N="492" REF="596">
from Plutarch's Lives, may be thought at pre&s;ent a more incom|patible and extraordinary character, than a canon of Wind&s;or under&s;tanding no Greek and but little Latin, yet Eli&s;abeth's pa&s;|&s;ion for the&s;e acqui&s;itions was then natural, and re&s;ulted from the genius and habitudes of her age.</P>
<P>The books of antiquity being thus familiari&s;ed to the great, every thing was tinctured with antient hi&s;tory and mythology. The heathen gods, although di&s;countenanced by the Calvini&s;ts on a &s;u&s;picion of their tending to cheri&s;h and revive a &s;pirit of idolatry, came into general vogue. When the queen paraded through a country-town, almo&s;t every pageant was a pantheon. When &s;he paid a vi&s;it at the hou&s;e of any of her nobility, at en|tering the hall &s;he was &s;aluted by the Penates, and conducted to her privy-chamber by Mercury. Even the pa&s;try-cooks were ex|pert mythologi&s;ts. At dinner, &s;elect transformations of Ovid's metamorpho&s;es were exhibited in confectionary: and the &s;plen|did iceing of an immen&s;e hi&s;toric plumb-cake, was embo&s;&s;ed with a delicious ba&s;&s;o-relievo of the de&s;truction of Troy. In the afternoon, when &s;he conde&s;cended to walk in the garden, the lake was covered with Tritons and Nereids: the pages of the family were converted into Wood-nymphs who peeped from every bower: and the footmen gamboled over the lawns in the figure of Satyrs. I &s;peak it without de&s;igning to in&s;inuate any unfavourable &s;u&s;picions, but it &s;eems difficult to &s;ay, why Eli&s;a|beth's virginity &s;hould have been made the theme of perpetual and exce&s;&s;ive panegyric: nor does it immediately appear, that there is le&s;s merit or glory in a married than a maiden queen. Yet, the next morning, after &s;leeping in a room hung with the tape&s;|try of the voyage of Eneas, when her maje&s;ty hunted in the Park, &s;he was met by Diana, who pronouncing our royal prude to be the brighte&s;t paragon of un&s;potted cha&s;tity, invited her to groves free from the intru&s;ions of Acteon. The truth is, &s;he was &s;o profu&s;ely flattered for this virtue, becau&s;e it was e&s;teemed the characteri&s;tical ornament of the heroines, as fanta&s;tic honour was the chief pride of the champions, of the old barbarous romance.

It was in conformity to the &s;entiments of chivalry, which &s;till continued in vogue, that &s;he was celebrated for cha&s;tity: the compliment, however, was paid in a cla&s;&s;ical allu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Queens mu&s;t be ridiculous when they would appear as women. The &s;ofter attractions of &s;ex vani&s;h on the throne. Eli&s;abeth &s;ought all occa&s;ions of being extolled for her beauty, of which indeed in the prime of her youth &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but a &s;mall &s;hare, whatever might have been her preten&s;ions to ab&s;olute virginity. Notwith&s;tanding her exaggerated habits of dignity and cere|mony, and a certain affectation of imperial &s;everity, &s;he did not perceive this ambition of being complimented for beauty, to be an idle and unpardonable levity, totally incon&s;i&s;tent with her high &s;tation and character. As &s;he conquered all nations with her arms, it matters not what were the triumphs of her eyes. Of what con&s;equence was the complexion of the mi&s;tre&s;s of the world? Not le&s;s vain of her per&s;on than her politics, this &s;tately coquet, the guardian of the prote&s;tant faith, the terror of the &s;ea, the mediatrix of the factions of France, and the &s;courge of Spain, was infinitely mortified, if an emba&s;&s;ador, at the fir&s;t audience, did not tell her &s;he was the fine&s;t woman in Europe. No negociation &s;ucceeded unle&s;s &s;he was addre&s;&s;ed as a godde&s;s. Encomia&s;tic harangues drawn from this topic, even on the &s;uppo&s;ition of youth and beauty, were &s;urely &s;uper|fluous, un&s;uitable, and unworthy; and were offered and received with an equal impropriety. Yet when &s;he rode through the &s;treets of the city of Norwich, Cupid, at the command of the mayor and aldermen, advancing from a groupe of gods who had left Olympus to grace the proce&s;&s;ion, gave her a golden arrow, the mo&s;t effective weapon of his well-furni&s;hed quiver, which under the influence of &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible charms was &s;ure to wound the mo&s;t obdurate heart. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A gift, &s;ays hone&s;t Hollin&s;hed, which her maje&s;ty, now verging to her fiftieth year, received very thankfullie <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">CHRON. iii. f. 1297.</NOTE>."</Q> In one of the ful&s;ome interludes at

<P>This inundation of cla&s;&s;ical pedantry &s;oon infected our poetry. Our writers, already trained in the &s;chool of fancy, were &s;ud|denly dazzled with the&s;e novel imaginations, and the divinities and heroes of pagan antiquity decorated every compo&s;ition. The perpetual allu&s;ions to antient fable were often introduced without the lea&s;t regard to propriety. Shake&s;peare's Mrs. Page, who is not intended in any degree to be a learned or an affected lady, laughing at the cumber&s;ome court&s;hip of her corpulent lover Fal&s;taffe, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I had rather be a giante&s;s and lie under mount Pelion <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">MERRY W. Act. ii.

The tran&s;lations of the cla&s;&s;ics, which now employed every pen, gave a currency and a celebrity to the&s;e fancies, and had the effect of diffu&s;ing them among the people. No &s;ooner were they delivered from the pale of the &s;chola&s;tic languages, than they acquired a general notoriety. Ovid's metamorpho&s;es ju&s;t tran&s;lated by Golding, to in&s;tance no farther, di&s;clo&s;ed a new world of fiction, even to the illiterate. As we had now all the antient fables in Engli&s;h, learned allu|&s;ions, whether in a poem or a pageant, were no longer ob&s;cure and unintelligible to common readers and common &s;pectators. And here we are led to ob&s;erve, that at this re&s;toration of the cla&s;&s;ics, we were fir&s;t &s;truck only with their fabulous inventions. We did not attend to their regularity of de&s;ign and ju&s;tne&s;s of &s;entiment. A rude age, beginning to read the&s;e writers, imitated their extravagancies, not their natural beauties. And the&s;e, like other novelties, were pur&s;ued to a blameable exce&s;s.</P>

I have before given a &s;ketch of the introduction of cla&s;&s;ical &s;tories, in the &s;plendid &s;how exhibited at the coronation of queen Anne Boleyn. But that is a rare and a premature in|&s;tance: and the pagan fictions are there complicated with the barbari&s;ms of the catholic wor&s;hip, and the doctrines of &s;cho|la&s;tic theology. Cla&s;&s;ical learning was not then &s;o widely &s;pread, either by &s;tudy or tran&s;lation, as to bring the&s;e learned &s;pecta|cles into fa&s;hion, to frame them with &s;ufficient &s;kill, and to pre&s;ent them with propriety.</P>
<P>Another capital &s;ource of the poetry peculiar to this period, con&s;i&s;ted in the numerous tran&s;lations of Italian tales into Eng|li&s;h. The&s;e narratives, not dealing altogether in romantic in|ventions, but in real life and manners, and in artful arrange|ments of fictitious yet probable events, afforded a new gratifica|tion to a people which yet retained their antient reli&s;h for tale|telling, and became the fa&s;hionable amu&s;ement of all who pro|fe&s;&s;ed to read for plea&s;ure. They gave ri&s;e to innumerable plays and poems, which would not otherwi&s;e have exi&s;ted; and turned the thoughts of our writers to new inventions of the &s;ame kind. Before the&s;e books became common, affecting &s;ituations, the combination of incident, and the pathos of cata&s;trophe, were almo&s;t unknown. Di&s;tre&s;s, e&s;pecially that ari&s;ing from the con|flicts of the tender pa&s;&s;ion, had not yet been &s;hewn in its mo&s;t intere&s;ting forms. It was hence our poets, particularly the dra|matic, borrowed ideas of a legitimate plot, and the complica|tion of facts nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a &s;tory either of the comic or tragic &s;pecies. In proportion as knowledge encrea&s;ed, genius had wanted &s;ubjects and materials. The&s;e pieces u&s;urped the place of legends and chronicles. And although the old hi&s;torical &s;ongs of the min&s;trels contained much bold adventure, heroic enterpri&s;e, and &s;trong touches of rude delineation, yet they failed in that multiplication and di&s;po&s;ition of circum&s;tances, and in that de&s;cription of characters and events approaching nearer to truth and reality, which were demanded by a more

di&s;cerning and curious age. Even the rugged features of the original Gothic romance were &s;oftened by this &s;ort of reading: and the Italian pa&s;toral, yet with &s;ome mixture of the kind of incidents de&s;cribed in Heliodorus's Ethiopic hi&s;tory now newly tran&s;lated, was engrafted on the feudal manners in Sydney's ARCADIA.</P>
<P>But the reformation had not yet de&s;troyed every delu&s;ion, nor di&s;inchanted all the &s;trong holds of &s;uper&s;tition. A few dim characters were yet legible in the mouldering creed of tradition. Every goblin of ignorance did not vani&s;h at the fir&s;t glimmer|ings of the morning of &s;cience. Rea&s;on &s;uffered a few demons &s;till to linger, which &s;he cho&s;e to retain in her &s;ervice under the guidance of poetry. Men believed, or were willing to believe, that &s;pirits were yet hovering around, who brought with them <HI>airs from heaven, or bla&s;ts from hell,</HI> that the gho&s;t was duely relea&s;ed from his pri&s;on of torment at the &s;ound of the curfue, and that fairies imprinted my&s;terious circles on the turf by moonlight. Much of this credulity was even con&s;ecrated by the name of &s;cience and profound &s;peculation. Pro&s;pero had not yet <HI>broken and buried his &s;taff,</HI> nor <HI>drowned his book deeper than did ever plummet &s;ound.</HI> It was now that the alchymi&s;t, and the ju|dicial a&s;trologer, conducted his occult operations by the potent intercour&s;e of &s;ome preternatural being, who came ob&s;equious to his call, and was bound to accompli&s;h his &s;evere&s;t &s;ervices, under certain conditions, and for a limited duration of time. It was actually one of the pretended feats of the&s;e fanta&s;tic philo|&s;ophers, to evoke the queen of the Fairies in the &s;olitude of a gloomy grove, who, preceded by a &s;udden ru&s;tling of the leaves, appeared in robes of tran&s;cendent lu&s;tre <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Lilly's LIFE, p. 151.</NOTE>.

Undoubtedly mo&s;t of the&s;e notions were credited and enter|tained in a much higher degree, in the preceding periods. But the arts of compo&s;ition had not then made a &s;ufficient progre&s;s, nor would the poets of tho&s;e periods have managed them with &s;o much addre&s;s and judgement. We were now arrived at that point, when the national credulity, cha&s;tened by rea&s;on, had produced a &s;ort of civilized &s;uper&s;tition, and left a &s;et of tradi|tions, fanciful enough for poetic decoration, and yet not too violent and chimerical for common &s;en&s;e.

<P>In the mean time the Gothic romance, although &s;omewhat &s;hook by the cla&s;&s;ical fictions, and by the tales of Boccace and Bandello, &s;till maintained its ground: and the daring machine|ries of giants, dragons, and inchanted ca&s;tles, borrowed from the magic &s;torehou&s;e of Boiardo, Ario&s;to, and Ta&s;&s;o, began to be em|ployed by the epic mu&s;e. The&s;e ornaments have been cen&s;ured by the bigotry of preci&s;e and &s;ervile critics, as abounding in whim&s;ical ab&s;urdities, and as unwarrantable deviations from the practice of Homer and Virgil. The author of AN ENQUIRY INTO THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF HOMER is willing to allow a fertility of genius, and a felicity of expre&s;&s;ion, to Ta&s;&s;o and Ario&s;to; but at the &s;ame time complains, that, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"quitting life, they betook them&s;elves to aerial beings and Utopian characters, and filled their works with Charms and Vi&s;ions, the modern Supplements of the Marvellous and Sublime.

Nor am I convinced, that the imagery of I&s;meno's necromantic fore&s;t in the Gieru&s;alemme Liberata, guarded by walls and battlements of fire, is le&s;s marvellous and &s;ublime, than the leap of Juno's hor&s;es in the Iliad, celebrated by Lon|ginus for its &s;ingular magnificence and dignity <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">IL<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">AD, V. 770.

But I forbear to anticipate my opi|nion of a &s;y&s;tem, which will more properly be con&s;idered, when I come to &s;peak of Spen&s;er. I mu&s;t, however, ob&s;erve here, that the Gothic and pagan fictions were now frequently blended and incorporated. The Lady of the Lake floated in the &s;uite of Neptune before queen Eli&s;abeth at Kenilworth; Ariel a&s;&s;umes the &s;emblance of a &s;ea-nymph, and Hecate, by an ea&s;y a&s;&s;ocia|tion, conducts the rites of the weird &s;i&s;ters in Macbeth.</P>
<P>Allegory had been derived from the religious dramas into our civil &s;pectacles. The ma&s;ques and pageantries of the age of Eli&s;abeth were not only furni&s;hed by the heathen divinities, but often by the virtues and vices imper&s;onated, &s;ignificantly deco|rated, accurately di&s;tingui&s;hed by their proper types, and repre|&s;ented by living actors. The antient &s;ymbolical &s;hews of this &s;ort began now to lo&s;e their old barbari&s;m and a mixture of re|ligion, and to a&s;&s;ume a degree of poetical elegance and preci&s;ion. Nor was it only in the conformation of particular figures that much fancy was &s;hewn, but in the contexture of &s;ome of the fables or devices pre&s;ented by groupes of ideal per&s;onages. The&s;e exhibitions quickened creative invention, and reflected back on poetry what poetry had given. From their familiarity and public nature, they formed a national ta&s;te for allegory; and the allego|rical poets were now writing to the people. Even romance was turned into this channel. In the Fairy Queen, allegory is wrought upon chivalry, and the feats and figments of Arthur's round table
<PB N="499" REF="603">
are morali&s;ed. The virtues of magnificence and cha&s;tity are here per&s;onified: but they are imaged with the forms, and under the agency, of romantic knights and dam&s;els. What was an after|thought in Ta&s;&s;o, appears to have been Spen&s;er's premeditated and primary de&s;ign. In the mean time, we mu&s;t not confound the&s;e moral combatants of the Fairy Queen with &s;ome of its other embodied ab&s;tractions, which are purely and profe&s;&s;edly allegorical.</P>
<P>It may here be added, that only a few critical treati&s;es, and but one ART OF POETRY, were now written. Sentiments and images were not ab&s;olutely determined by the canons of compo|&s;ition: nor was genius awed by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a future and final arraignment at the tribunal of ta&s;te. A certain dignity of inattention to niceties is now vi&s;ible in our writers. Without too clo&s;ely con&s;ulting a criterion of correctne&s;s, every man indulged his own capriciou&s;ne&s;s of invention. The poet's appeal was chiefly to his own voluntary feelings, his own immediate and peculiar mode of conception. And this freedom of thought was often expre&s;&s;ed in an undi&s;gui&s;ed frankne&s;s of diction. A cir|cum&s;tance, by the way, that greatly contributed to give the flowing modulation which now marked the mea&s;ures of our poets, and which &s;oon degenerated into the oppo&s;ite extreme of di&s;&s;onance and a&s;perity. Selection and di&s;crimination were often overlooked. Shake&s;peare wandered in pur&s;uit of univer&s;al nature. The glancings of his eye are from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven. We behold him breaking the barriers of imaginary method. In the &s;ame &s;cene, he de&s;cends from his meridian of the noble&s;t tragic &s;ublimity, to puns and quibbles, to the meane&s;t merriments of a plebeian farce. In the mid&s;t of his dignity, he re&s;embles his own Richard the &s;econd, the <HI>&s;kipping king,</HI> who &s;ometimes di&s;carding the &s;tate of a monarch,

<P>No Satires, properly &s;o called, were written till towards the latter end of the queen's reign, and then but a few. Pictures drawn at large of the vices of the times, did not &s;uit readers who loved to wander in the regions of artificial manners. The Mu&s;e, like the people, was too &s;olemn and re&s;erved, too cere|monious and pedantic, to &s;toop to common life. Satire is the poetry of a nation highly poli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The importance of the female character was not yet acknow|ledged, nor were women admitted into the general commerce of &s;ociety. The effect of that intercour&s;e had not imparted a comic air to poetry, nor &s;oftened the &s;everer tone of our ver&s;ification with the levities of gallantry, and the familiarities of compli|ment, &s;ometimes perhaps operating on &s;erious &s;ubjects, and im|pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ceptibly &s;preading them&s;elves in the general habits of &s;tyle and thought. I do not mean to in&s;inuate, that our poetry has &s;uffered from the great change of manners, which this a&s;&s;umption of the gentler <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ex, or rather the improved &s;tate of female education, has produced, by giving elegance and variety to life, by enlarging the &s;phere of conver&s;ation, and by multiplying the topics and enriching the &s;tores of wit and humour. But I am marking the peculiarities of compo&s;ition: and my meaning was to &s;ugge&s;t, that the ab&s;ence of &s;o important a circum&s;tance from the modes and con&s;titution of ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ent life, mu&s;t have influenced the cotem|porary poetry.

Percy, Henry the fifth, and Ma&s;ter Fenton. Their tragic heroines, their De&s;demonas and Ophelias, although of &s;o much con&s;equence in the piece, are degraded to the back-ground.

<P>All or mo&s;t of the&s;e circum&s;tances, contributed to give a de&s;criptive, a picture&s;que, and a figurative ca&s;t to the poetical language. This effect appears even in the pro&s;e compo&s;itions of the reign of Eli&s;abeth. In the &s;ub&s;equent age, pro&s;e became the language of poetry.</P>
<P>In the mean time, general knowledge was encrea&s;ing with a wide diffu&s;ion and a ha&s;ty rapidity. Books began to be multi|plied, and a variety of the mo&s;t u&s;eful and rational topics had been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in our own language. But &s;cience had not made too great advances. On the whole, we were now arrived at that period, propitious to the operations of original and true poetry, when the coyne&s;s of fancy was not always proof again&s;t the approaches of rea&s;on, when genius was rather directed than go|verned by judgement, and when ta&s;te and learning had &s;o far only di&s;ciplined imagination, as to &s;uffer its exce&s;&s;es to pa&s;s without cen&s;ure or controul, for the &s;ake of the beauties to which they were allied.</P>
