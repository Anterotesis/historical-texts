<HEAD>SPEECH OF EDMUND BURKE, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>I HOPE, Sir, that, notwith&s;tanding the au&s;terity of the Chair, your good-nature will incline you to &s;ome degree of indulgence towards human frailty. You will not think it unnatural, that tho&s;e who have an object depending, which &s;trongly engages their hopes and fears, &s;hould be &s;omewhat inclined to &s;uper&s;tition. As I came into the hou&s;e full of anxiety about the event of my motion, I found to my infinite &s;urprize, that the grand penal Bill, by which we had pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence on the trade and &s;u&s;tenance of America, is to be returned to us from the other Hou&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Act to re&s;train the Trade and Commerce of the Provinces of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay and New Hamp&s;hire, and Colonies of Connecticut and Rhode I&s;land, and Providence Plantation, in North America, to Great-Britain, Ireland, and the Briti&s;h I&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies; and to prohibit &s;uch Provinces and Colonies from carrying on any Fi&s;hery on the Banks of Newfoundland, and other places therein mentioned, under certain Conditions and Limitations.</NOTE>. I do confe&s;s, I could not help looking on this event as a fortunate omen. I look upon it as a &s;ort of providential favour; by which we are put once more in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our deliberative capacity, upon a bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o very
<PB N="2" REF="5">
que&s;tionable in its nature, &s;o very uncertain in its i&s;&s;ue. By the return of this Bill, which &s;eemed to have taken its flight for ever, we are at this very in&s;tant nearly as free to chu&s;e a plan for our American Government, as we were on the fir&s;t day of the Se&s;&s;ion. If, Sir, we incline to the &s;ide of conciliation, we are not at all embarra&s;&s;ed (unle&s;s we plea&s;e to make our&s;elves &s;o) by any incon|gruous mixture of coercion and re&s;traint. We are therefore called upon, as it were by a &s;uperior warning voice, again to attend to America; to attend to the whole of it together; and to review the &s;ubject with an unu&s;ual degree of care and calmne&s;s.</P>
<P>Surely it is an awful &s;ubject; or there is none &s;o on this &s;ide of the grave. When I fir&s;t had the honour of a &s;eat in this Hou&s;e, the affairs of that Continent pre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves upon us, as the mo&s;t important and mo&s;t delicate object of parliamentary attention. My little &s;hare in this great deliberation oppre&s;&s;ed me. I found my&s;elf a partaker in a very high tru&s;t; and having no &s;ort of rea&s;on to rely on the &s;trength of my natural abilities for the proper execution of that tru&s;t, I was obliged to take more than common pains, to in|&s;truct my&s;elf in every thing which relates to our Colonies. I was not le&s;s under the nece&s;&s;ity of forming &s;ome fixed ideas, concerning the general policy of the Briti&s;h Empire. Something of this &s;ort &s;eemed to be indi&s;pen&s;able; in order, amid&s;t &s;o va&s;t a fluctuation of pa&s;&s;ions and opinions, to concenter my thoughts; to balla&s;t my conduct; to pre&s;erve me from being blown about by every wind of fa&s;hionable doctrine. I really did not think it &s;afe, or manly, to have fre&s;h principles to &s;eek upon every fre&s;h mail which &s;hould arrive from America.</P>
<P>At that period, I had the fortune to find my&s;elf in perfect con|currence with a large majority in this Hou&s;e. Bowing under that high authority, and penetrated with the &s;harpne&s;s and &s;trength of that early impre&s;&s;ion, I have continued ever &s;ince, without the lea&s;t deviation, in my original &s;entiments. Whether this be owing to an ob&s;tinate per&s;everance in error, or to a religious adherence to what appears to me truth and rea&s;on, it is in your equity to judge.</P>
<P>Sir, Parliament having an enlarged view of objects, made, during this interval, more frequent changes in their &s;entiments and their
<PB N="3" REF="6">
conduct, than could be ju&s;tified in a particular per&s;on upon the contracted &s;cale of private information. But though I do not hazard any thing approaching to a cen&s;ure on the motives of former parliaments to all tho&s;e alterations, one fact is undoubted; that under them the &s;tate of America has been kept in continual agitation. Every thing admini&s;tered as remedy to the public complaint, if it did not produce, was at lea&s;t followed by, an heightening of the di&s;temper; until, by a variety of experiments, that important Country has been brought into her pre&s;ent &s;ituation;&mdash;a &s;ituation, which I will not mi&s;call, which I dare not name; which I &s;carcely know how to comprehend in the terms of any de|&s;cription.</P>
<P>In this po&s;ture, Sir, things &s;tood at the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. About that time, a worthy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Ro&s;e Fuller.</NOTE> member of great parliamentary ex|perience, who, in the year 1766, filled the chair of the American committee with much ability, took me a&s;ide; and, lamenting the pre&s;ent a&s;pect of our politicks, told me, things were come to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that our former methods of proceeding in the hou&s;e would be no longer tolerated. That the publick tribunal (never too in|dulgent to a long and un&s;ucce&s;sful oppo&s;ition) would now &s;crutinize our conduct with unu&s;ual &s;everity. That the very vici&s;&s;itudes and &s;hiftings of mini&s;terial mea&s;ures, in&s;tead of convicting their authors of incon&s;tancy and want of &s;y&s;tem, would be taken as an occa&s;ion of charging us with a pre-determined di&s;content, which nothing could &s;atisfy; whil&s;t we accu&s;ed every mea&s;ure of vigour as cruel, and every propo&s;al of lenity as weak and irre&s;olute. The public, he &s;aid, would not have patience to &s;ee us play the game out with our adver&s;aries: we mu&s;t produce our hand. It would be expected, that tho&s;e who for many years had been active in &s;uch affairs &s;hould &s;hew, that they had formed &s;ome clear and decided idea of the principles of Colony Government; and were capable of draw|ing out &s;omething like a platform of the ground, which might be laid for future and permanent tranquillity.</P>
<P>I felt the truth of what my Hon. Friend repre&s;ented; but I felt my &s;ituation too. His application might have been made with far
<PB N="4" REF="7">
greater propriety to many other gentlemen. No man was indeed ever better di&s;po&s;ed, or wor&s;e qualified, for &s;uch an undertaking than my&s;elf. Though I gave &s;o far into his opinion, that I immediately threw my thoughts into a &s;ort of parliamentary form, I was by no means equally ready to produce them. It generally argues &s;ome degree of natural impotence of mind, or &s;ome want of know|ledge of the world, to hazard Plans of Government, except from a &s;eat of Authority. Propo&s;itions are made, not only ineffectually, but &s;omewhat di&s;reputably, when the minds of men are not pro|perly di&s;po&s;ed for their reception; and for my part, I am not ambi|tious of ridicule; not ab&s;olutely a candidate for di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Sir, to &s;peak the plain truth, I have in general no very exalted opinion of the virtue of Paper Government; nor of any Politics, in which the plan is to be wholly &s;eparated from the exe|cution. But when I &s;aw, that anger and violence prevailed every day more and more; and that things were ha&s;tening towards an in|curable alienation of our Colonies; I confe&s;s, my caution gave way. I felt this, as one of tho&s;e few moments in which decorum yields to an higher duty. Public calamity is a mighty leveller; and there are occa&s;ions when any, even the &s;lighte&s;t, chance of doing good, mu&s;t be laid hold on, even by the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable per&s;on.</P>
<P>To re&s;tore order and repo&s;e to an Empire &s;o great and &s;o di&s;tracted as ours, is, merely in the attempt, an undertaking that would en|noble the flights of the highe&s;t genius, and obtain pardon for the efforts of the meane&s;t under&s;tanding. Struggling a good while with the&s;e thoughts, by degrees I felt my&s;elf more firm. I de|rived, at length, &s;ome confidence from what in other circum&s;tances u&s;ually produces timidity. I grew le&s;s anxious, even from the idea of my own in&s;ignificance. For, judging of what you are, by what you ought to be, I per&s;uaded my&s;elf, that you would not reject a rea&s;onable propo&s;ition, becau&s;e it had nothing but its rea&s;on to re|commend it. On the other hand, being totally de&s;titute of all &s;hadow of influence, natural or adventitious, I was very &s;ure, that, if my propo&s;ition were futile or dangerous; if it were weakly conceived, or improperly timed, there was nothing exterior to it,
<PB N="5" REF="8">
of power to awe, dazzle, or delude you. You will &s;ee it ju&s;t as it is; and you will treat it ju&s;t as it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>The propo&s;ition is Peace. Not Peace through the medium of War; not Peace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endle&s;s negociations; not Peace to ari&s;e out of univer&s;al di&s;cord, fomented, from principle, in all parts of the Empire; not Peace to depend on the Juridical Determination of perplex|ing que&s;tions; or the preci&s;e marking the &s;hadowy boundaries of a complex Government. It is &s;imple Peace; &s;ought in its natural cour&s;e, and its ordinary haunts.&mdash;It is Peace &s;ought in the Spirit of Peace; and laid in principles purely pacific. I propo&s;e, by removing the Ground of the difference, and by re&s;toring the <HI>for|mer un&s;u&s;pecting confidence of the Colonies in the Mother Country,</HI> to give permanent &s;atisfaction to your people; and (far from a &s;cheme of ruling by di&s;cord) to reconcile them to each other in the &s;ame act, and by the bond of the very &s;ame intere&s;t, which reconciles them to Briti&s;h Government.</P>
<P>My idea is nothing more. Refined policy ever has been the parent of confu&s;ion; and ever will be &s;o, as long as the world endures. Plain good intention, which is as ea&s;ily di&s;covered at the fir&s;t view, as fraud is &s;urely detected at la&s;t, is, let me &s;ay, of no mean force in the Government of Mankind. Genuine Simplicity of heart is an healing and cementing principle. My Plan, therefore, being formed upon the mo&s;t &s;imple grounds imaginable, may di&s;appoint &s;ome people, when they hear it. It has nothing to re|commend it to the pruriency of curious ears. There is nothing at all new and captivating in it. It has nothing of the Splendor of the Project, which has been lately laid upon your Table by the Noble Lord in the Blue Ribband<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That when the Governor, Council, or A&s;&s;embly, or General Court, of any of his Ma|je&s;ty's Provinces or Colonies in America, &s;hall <HI>propo&s;e</HI> to make provi&s;ion, <HI>according to the condi|tion, circum&s;tances,</HI> and <HI>&s;ituation,</HI> of &s;uch Province or Colony, for contributing their <HI>proportion</HI> to the <HI>Common Defence</HI> (&s;uch <HI>proportion</HI> to be rai&s;ed under the Authority of the General Court, or General A&s;&s;embly, of &s;uch Province or Colony, and di&s;po&s;able by Parliament) and &s;hall <HI>engage</HI> to make provi&s;ion al&s;o for the &s;upport of the Civil Government, and the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, in &s;uch Province or Colony, it will be proper, <HI>if &s;uch Propo&s;al &s;hall be approved by his Maje&s;ty, and the two Hou&s;es of Parliament,</HI> and for &s;o long as &s;uch Pro|vi&s;ion &s;hall be made accordingly, to forbear, <HI>in re&s;pect of &s;uch Province or Colony,</HI> to levy any Duty, Tax, or A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, or to impo&s;e any farther Duty, Tax, or A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, except &s;uch Duties as it may be expedient to continue to levy or impo&s;e, for the Regulation of Com|merce; the Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Produce of the Duties la&s;t mentioned to be carried to the account of &s;uch Province or Colony re&s;pectively." <BIBL>Re&s;olution moved by Lord North in the Committee; and agreed to by the Hou&s;e, 27 Feb. 1775.</BIBL></Q></P> </NOTE>. It does not propo&s;e to fill your
<PB N="6" REF="9">
Lobby with &s;quabbling Colony Agents, who will require the in|terpo&s;ition of your Mace, at every in&s;tant, to keep the peace among&s;t them. It does not in&s;titute a magnificent Auction of Finance, where captivated provinces come to general ran&s;om by bidding again&s;t each other, until you knock down the hammer, and determine a proportion of payments, beyond all the powers of Algebra to equalize and &s;ettle.</P>
<P>The plan, which I &s;hall pre&s;ume to &s;ugge&s;t, derives, however, one great advantage from the propo&s;ition and regi&s;try of that Noble Lord's Project. The idea of conciliation is admi&s;&s;ible. Fir&s;t, the hou&s;e, in accepting the re&s;olution moved by the Noble Lord, has admitted, notwith&s;tanding the menacing front of our Addre&s;s, notwith&s;tanding our heavy Bill of Pains and Penalties&mdash;that we do not think our&s;elves precluded from all ideas of free Grace and Bounty.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e has gone farther; it has declared conciliation admi&s;|&s;ible, <HI>previous</HI> to any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the part of America. It has even &s;hot a good deal beyond that mark, and has admitted, that the complaints of our former mode of exerting the Right of Taxa|tion were not wholly unfounded. That right thus exerted is al|lowed to have had &s;omething reprehen&s;ible in it; &s;omething unwi&s;e, or &s;omething grievous: &s;ince, in the mid&s;t of our heat and re&s;ent|ment, we, of our&s;elves, have propo&s;ed a capital alteration; and, in order to get rid of what &s;eemed &s;o very exceptionable, have in|&s;tituted a mode that is altogether new; one that is, indeed, wholly alien from all the ancient methods and forms of Parliament.</P>
<P>The <HI>principle</HI> of this proceeding is large enough for my purpo&s;e. The means propo&s;ed by the noble Lord for carrying his ideas into execution, I think indeed, are very indifferently &s;uited to the end; and this I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew you before I &s;it down. But, for the pre&s;ent, I take my ground on the admitted principle. I mean
<PB N="7" REF="10">
to give peace. Peace implies reconciliation; and where there has been a material di&s;pute, reconciliation does in a manner always im|ply conce&s;&s;ion on the one part or on the other. In this &s;tate of things I make no difficulty in affirming, that the propo&s;al ought to originate from us. Great and acknowledged force is not impaired, either in effect or in opinion, by an unwillingne&s;s to exert it&s;elf. The &s;uperior power may offer peace with honour and with &s;afety. Such an offer from &s;uch a power will be attributed to magnanimity. But the conce&s;&s;ions of the weak are the conce&s;&s;ions of fear. When &s;uch a one is di&s;armed, he is wholly at the mercy of his &s;uperior; and he lo&s;es for ever that time and tho&s;e chances, which, as they hap|pen to all men, are the &s;trength and re&s;ources of all inferior power.</P>
<P>The capital leading que&s;tions on which you mu&s;t this day de|cide, are the&s;e two. Fir&s;t, whether you ought to concede; and &s;econdly, what your conce&s;&s;ion ought to be. On the fir&s;t of the&s;e que&s;tions we have gained (as I have ju&s;t taken the liberty of ob|&s;erving to you) &s;ome ground. But I am &s;en&s;ible that a good deal more is &s;till to be done. Indeed, Sir, to enable us to determine both on the one and the other of the&s;e great que&s;tions with a firm and preci&s;e judgement, I think it may be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider di&s;tinctly the true nature and the peculiar circum&s;tances of the object which we have before us. Becau&s;e after all our &s;truggle, whether we will or not, we mu&s;t govern America, according to that nature, and to tho&s;e circum&s;tances; and not according to our own ima|ginations; not according to ab&s;tract ideas of right; by no means according to mere general theories of government, the re&s;ort to which appears to me, in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, no better than arrant trifling. I &s;hall therefore endeavour, with your leave, to lay before you &s;ome of the mo&s;t material of the&s;e circum&s;tances in as full and as clear a manner as I am able to &s;eate them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that we have to con&s;ider with regard to the na|ture of the object is&mdash;the number of people in the Colonies. I have taken for &s;ome years a good deal of pains on that point. I can by no calculation ju&s;tify my&s;elf in placing the number below Two Millions of inhabitants of our own European blood and colour; be|&s;ides at lea&s;t 500,000 others, who form no incon&s;iderable part of the &s;trength and opulence of the whole. This, Sir, is, I believe, about
<PB N="8" REF="11">
the true number. There is no occa&s;ion to exaggerate, where plain truth is of &s;o much weight and importance. But whether I put the pre&s;ent numbers too high or too low, is a matter of little moment. Such is the &s;trength with which population &s;hoots in that part of the world, that &s;tate the numbers as high as we will, whil&s;t the di&s;|pute continues, the exaggeration ends. Whil&s;t we are di&s;cu&s;&s;ing any given magnitude, they are grown to it. Whil&s;t we &s;pend our time in deliberating on the mode of governing Two Millions, we &s;hall find we have Millions more to manage. Your children do not grow fa&s;ter from infancy to manhood, than they, &s;pread from fa|milies to communities, and from villages to nations.</P>
<P>I put this con&s;ideration of the pre&s;ent and the growing numbers in the front of our deliberation; becau&s;e, Sir, this con&s;ideration will make it evident to a blunter di&s;cernment than yours, that no partial, narrow, contracted, pinched, occa&s;ional &s;y&s;tem will be at all &s;uitable to &s;uch an object. It will &s;hew you, that it is not to be con&s;idered as one of tho&s;e <HI>Minima</HI> which are out of the eye and con&s;ideration of the law; not a paltry excre&s;cence of the &s;tate; not a mean de|pendant, who may be neglected with little damage, and provoked with little danger. It will prove, that &s;ome degree of care and cau|tion is required in the handling &s;uch an object; it will &s;hew, that you ought not, in rea&s;on, to trifle with &s;o large a ma&s;s of the in|tere&s;ts and feelings of the human race. You could at no time do &s;o without guilt; and be a&s;&s;ured you will not be able to do it long with impunity.</P>
<P>But the population of this country, the great and growing popu|lation, though a very important con&s;ideration, will lo&s;e much of its weight, if not combined with other circum&s;tances. The com|merce of your Colonies is out of all proportion beyond the numbers of the people. This ground of their commerce indeed has been trod &s;ome days ago, and with great ability, by a di&s;tingui&s;hed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Glover.</NOTE> per&s;on, at your bar. This gentleman, after Thirty-five years&mdash;it is &s;o long &s;ince he fir&s;t appeared at the &s;ame place to plead for the commerce of Great Britain&mdash;has come again before you to plead the &s;ame cau&s;e, without any other effect of time, than, that to the fire of ima|gination and extent of erudition, which even then marked him as
<PB N="9" REF="12">
one of the fir&s;t literary characters of his age, he has added a con&s;um|mate knowledge in the commercial intere&s;t of his country, formed by a long cour&s;e of enlightened and di&s;criminating experience.</P>
<P>Sir, I &s;hould be inexcu&s;able in coming after &s;uch a per&s;on with any detail; if a great part of the members who now fill the Hou&s;e had not the misfortune to be ab&s;ent, when he appeared at your bar. Be&s;ides, Sir, I propo&s;e to take the matter at periods of time &s;omewhat different from his. There is, if I mi&s;take not, a point of view, from whence if you will look at this &s;ubject, it is impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould not make an impre&s;&s;ion upon you.</P>
<P>I have in my hand two accounts; one a comparative &s;tate of the export trade of England to its Colonies, as it &s;tood in the year 1704, and as it &s;tood in the year 1772. The other a &s;tate of the export trade of this country to its Colonies alone, as it &s;tood in 1772, compared with the whole trade of England to all parts of the world (the Colonies included) in the year 1704. They are from good vouchers; the latter period from the accounts on your table, the earlier from an original manu&s;cript of Davenant, who fir&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hed the In&s;pector General's office, which has been ever &s;ince his time &s;o abundant a &s;ource of parliamentary information.</P>
<P>The export trade to the Colonies con&s;i&s;ts of three great branches. The African, which, terminating almo&s;t wholly in the Colonies, mu&s;t be put to the account of their commerce; the We&s;t Indian; and the North American. All the&s;e are &s;o interwoven, that the at|tempt to &s;eparate them, would tear to pieces the contexture of the whole; and if not entirely de&s;troy, would very much de|preciate the value of all the parts. I therefore con&s;ider the&s;e three denominations to be, what in effect they are, one trade.</P>
<P>The trade to the Colonies, taken on the export &s;ide, at the begin|ning of this century, that is, in the year 1704, &s;tood thus: <TABLE>

<P>The trade with America alone is now within le&s;s than 500, 000 <HI>l.</HI> of being equal to what this great commercial nation, England, carried on at the beginning of this century with the whole world! If I had taken the large&s;t year of tho&s;e on your table, it would rather have exceeded. But, it will be &s;aid, is not this American trade an unnatural protuberance, that has drawn the juices from the re&s;t of the body? The rever&s;e. It is the very food that has nouri&s;hed every other part into its pre&s;ent magnitude. Our general trade has been greatly augmented; and augmented more or le&s;s in almo&s;t every part to which it ever extended; but with this material difference; that

of the Six Millions which in the beginning of the century con|&s;tituted the whole ma&s;s of our export commerce, the Colony trade was but one twelfth part; it is now (as a part of Sixteen Millions) con&s;iderably more than a third of the whole. This is the relative proportion of the importance of the Colonies at the&s;e two periods: and all rea&s;oning concerning our mode of treating them mu&s;t have this proportion as its ba&s;is; or it is a rea&s;oning weak, rotten, and &s;ophi&s;tical.</P>
<P>Mr. Speaker, I cannot prevail on my&s;elf to hurry over this great con&s;ideration. It is good for us to be here. We &s;tand where we have an immen&s;e view of what is, and what is pa&s;t. Clouds in|deed, and darkne&s;s, re&s;t upon the future. Let us however, before we de&s;cend from this noble eminence, reflect that this growth of our national pro&s;perity has happened within the &s;hort period of the life of man. It has happened within Sixty-eight years. There are tho&s;e alive who&s;e memory might touch the two extremities. For in&s;tance, my Lord Bathur&s;t might remember all the &s;tages of the progre&s;s. He was in 1704 of an age, at lea&s;t to be made to com|prehend &s;uch things. He was then old enough <HI>acta parentum jam legere, et quae &s;it poterit cogno&s;cere virtus</HI>&mdash;Suppo&s;e, Sir, that the angel of this au&s;picious youth, fore&s;eeing the many virtues, which made him one of the mo&s;t amiable, as he is one of the mo&s;t fortunate men of his age, had opened to him in vi&s;ion, that, when, in the fourth generation, the third Prince of the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick had &s;at Twelve years on the throne of that nation, which (by the happy i&s;&s;ue of moderate and healing councils) was to be made Great Britain, he &s;hould &s;ee his &s;on, Lord Chancellor of England, turn back the current of hereditary dignity to its foun|tain, and rai&s;e him to an higher rank of Peerage, whil&s;t he enriched the family with a new one&mdash;If amid&s;t the&s;e bright and happy &s;cenes of dome&s;tic honour and pro&s;perity, that angel &s;hould have drawn up the curtain, and unfolded the ri&s;ing glories of his country, and whil&s;t he was gazing with admiration on the then commercial grandeur of England, the Genius &s;hould point out to him a little &s;peck, &s;carce vi&s;ible in the ma&s;s of the national intere&s;t, a &s;mall &s;eminal principle, rather than a formed body, and &s;hould tell him&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Young man, There is America&mdash;which at this day &s;erves for little more than to amu&s;e you with &s;tories of &s;avage men, and uncouth
<PB N="12" REF="15">
manners; yet &s;hall, before you ta&s;te of death, &s;hew it&s;elf equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world. Whatever England has been growing to by a progre&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of improvement, brought in by varieties of people, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of civilizing conque&s;ts and civilizing &s;ettlements in a &s;eries of Seventeen Hundred years, you &s;hall &s;ee as much added to her by America in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle life!"</Q> If this &s;tate of his country had been foretold to him, would it not require all the &s;anguine credulity of youth, and all the fervid glow of enthu|&s;ia&s;m, to make him believe it? Fortunate man, he has lived to &s;ee it! Fortunate indeed, if he lives to &s;ee nothing that &s;hall vary the pro&s;pect, and cloud the &s;etting of his day!</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Sir, if turning from &s;uch thoughts I re&s;ume this comparative view once more. You have &s;een it on a large &s;cale; look at it on a &s;mall one. I will point out to your atten|tion a particular in&s;tance of it in the &s;ingle province of Pen&s;ylvania. In the year 1704 that province called for 11,459 <HI>l.</HI> in value of your commodities, native and foreign. This was the whole. What did it demand in 1772? Why nearly Fifty times as much; for in that year the export to Pen&s;ylvania was 507,909 <HI>l.</HI> nearly equal to the export to all the Colonies together in the fir&s;t period.</P>
<P>I choo&s;e, Sir, to enter into the&s;e minute and particular details; becau&s;e generalities, which in all other ca&s;es are apt to heighten and rai&s;e the &s;ubject, have here a tendency to &s;ink it. When we &s;peak of the commerce with our Colonies, fiction lags after truth; invention is unfruitful, and imagination cold and barren.</P>
<P>So far, Sir, as to the importance of the object in the view of its commerce, as concerned in the exports from England. If I were to detail the imports, I could &s;hew how many enjoyments they pro|cure, which deceive the burthen of life; how many materials which invigorate the &s;prings of national indu&s;try, and extend and animate every part of our foreign and dome&s;tic commerce. This would be a curious &s;ubject indeed&mdash;but I mu&s;t pre&s;cribe bounds to my&s;elf in a matter &s;o va&s;t and various.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="16">
I pa&s;s therefore to the Colonies in another point of view, their agriculture. This they have pro&s;ecuted with &s;uch a &s;pirit, that, be&s;ides feeding plentifully their own growing multitude, their an|nual export of grain, comprehending rice, has &s;ome years ago ex|ceeded a Million in value. Of their la&s;t harve&s;t, I am per&s;uaded, they will export much more. At the beginning of the century, &s;ome of the&s;e Colonies imported corn from the mother country. For &s;ome time pa&s;t, the old world has been fed from the new. The &s;carcity which you have felt would have been a de&s;olating famine; if this child of your old age, with a true filial piety, with a Roman charity, had not put the full brea&s;t of its youthful exube|rance to the mouth of its exhau&s;ted parent.</P>
<P>As to the wealth which the Colonies have drawn from the &s;ea by their fi&s;heries, you had all that matter fully opened at your bar. You &s;urely thought tho&s;e acqui&s;itions of value; for they &s;eemed even to excite your envy; and yet the &s;pirit, by which that enter|prizing employment has been exerci&s;ed, ought rather, in my opi|nion, to have rai&s;ed your e&s;teem and admiration. And pray, Sir, what in the world is equal to it? Pa&s;s by the other parts, and look at the manner in which the people of New England have of late carried on the Whale Fi&s;hery. Whil&s;t we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice, and behold them penetrating into the deepe&s;t frozen rece&s;&s;es of Hud&s;on's Bay, and Davis's Streights, whil&s;t we are looking for them beneath the Arctic circle, we hear that they have pierced into the oppo&s;ite region of polar cold, that they are at the Antipodes, and engaged under the frozen &s;erpent of the &s;outh. Falkland I&s;land, which &s;eemed too remote and ro|mantick an object for the gra&s;p of national ambition, is but a &s;tage and re&s;ting-place in the progre&s;s of their victorious indu&s;try. Nor is the equinoctial heat more di&s;couraging to them, than the ac|cumulated winter of both the poles. We know that whil&s;t &s;ome of them draw the line and &s;trike the harpoon on the coa&s;t of Africa, others run the longitude, and pur&s;ue their gigantic game along the coa&s;t of Brazil. No &s;ea but what is vexed by their fi&s;heries. No climate that is not witne&s;s to their toils. Neither the per&s;everance of Holland, nor the activity of France, nor the dextrous and firm &s;agacity of Engli&s;h enterprize, ever carried this mo&s;t perilous mode of hardy indu&s;try to the extent to which it
<PB N="14" REF="17">
has been pu&s;hed by this recent people; a people who are &s;till, as it were, but in the gri&s;tle, and not yet hardened into the bone of manhood. When I contemplate the&s;e things; when I know that the Colonies in general owe little or nothing to any care of ours, and that they are not &s;queezed into this happy form by the con&s;traints of watchful and &s;u&s;picious government, but that through a wi&s;e and &s;alutary neglect, a generous nature has been &s;uffered to take her own way to perfection: when I reflect upon the&s;e effects, when I &s;ee how profitable they have been to us, I feel all the pride of power &s;ink, and all pre&s;umption in the wi&s;dom of human con|trivances melt, and die away within me. My rigour relents. I pardon &s;omething to the &s;pirit of Liberty.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, Sir, that all which I have a&s;&s;erted in my detail, is admitted in the gro&s;s; but that quite a different conclu&s;ion is drawn from it. America, Gentlemen &s;ay, is a noble object. It is an object well worth fighting for. Certainly it is, if fighting a people be the be&s;t way of gaining them. Gentlemen in this re&s;pect will be led to their choice of means by their complexions and their habits. Tho&s;e who under&s;tand the military art, will of cour&s;e have &s;ome predilection for it. Tho&s;e who wield the thunder of the &s;tate, may have more confidence in the efficacy of arms. But I confe&s;s, po&s;|&s;ibly for want of this knowledge, my opinion is much more in favour of prudent management, than of force; con&s;idering force not as an odious, but a feeble in&s;trument, for pre&s;erving a people &s;o numerous, &s;o active, &s;o growing, &s;o &s;pirited as this, in a pro|fitable and &s;ubordinate connexion with us.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Sir, permit me to ob&s;erve, that the u&s;e of force alone is but <HI>temporary.</HI> It may &s;ubdue for a moment; but it does not re|move the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubduing again: and a nation is not governed, which is perpetually to be conquered.</P>
<P>My next objection is its <HI>uncertainty.</HI> Terror is not always the effect of force; and an armament is not a victory. If you do not &s;ucceed, you are without re&s;ource; for, conciliation failing, force remains; but, force failing, no further hope of reconciliation is left. Power and authority are &s;ometimes bought by kindne&s;s; but they
<PB N="15" REF="18">
can never be begged as alms, by an impoveri&s;hed and defeated violence.</P>
<P>A further objection to force is, that you <HI>impair the object</HI> by your very endeavours to pre&s;erve it. The thing you fought for, is not the thing which you recover; but depreciated, &s;unk, wa&s;ted, and con&s;umed in the conte&s;t. Nothing le&s;s will content me, than <HI>whole America.</HI> I do not choo&s;e to con&s;ume its &s;trength along with our own; becau&s;e in all parts it is the Briti&s;h &s;trength that I con|&s;ume. I do not choo&s;e to be caught by a foreign enemy at the end of this exhau&s;ting conflict; and &s;till le&s;s in the mid&s;t of it. I may e&s;cape; but I can make no in&s;urance again&s;t &s;uch an event. Let me add, that I do not choo&s;e wholly to break the American &s;pirit, be|cau&s;e it is the &s;pirit that has made the country.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, we have no &s;ort of <HI>experience</HI> in favour of force as an in|&s;trument in the rule of our Colonies. Their growth and their utility has been owing to methods altogether different. Our ancient indulgence has been &s;aid to be pur&s;ued to a fault. It may be &s;o. But we know, if feeling is evidence, that our fault was more tolerable than our attempt to mend it; and our &s;in far more &s;alutary than our panitence.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, are my rea&s;ons for not entertaining that high opinion of untried force, by which many Gentlemen, for who&s;e &s;entiments in other particulars I have great re&s;pect, &s;eem to be &s;o greatly captivated. But there is &s;till behind a third con&s;ideration concern|ing this object, which &s;erves to determine my opinion on the &s;ort of policy which ought to be pur&s;ued in the management of Ame|rica, even more than its Population and its Commerce, I mean its <HI>Temper and Character.</HI></P>
<P>In this Character of the Americans, a love of Freedom is the predominating feature, which marks and di&s;tingui&s;hes the whole: and as an ardent is always a jealous affection, your Colonies be|come &s;u&s;picious, re&s;tive, and untractable, whenever they &s;ee the lea&s;t attempt to wre&s;t from them by force, or &s;huffle from them by chicane, what they think the only advantage worth living for.
<PB N="16" REF="19">
This fierce &s;pirit of Liberty is &s;tronger in the Engli&s;h Colonies pro|bably than in any other people of the earth; and this from a great variety of powerful cau&s;es; which, to under&s;tand the true temper of their minds, and the direction which this &s;pirit takes, it will not be ami&s;s to lay open &s;omewhat more largely.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the people of the Colonies are de&s;cendents of Engli&s;hmen. England, Sir, is a nation, which &s;till I hope re&s;pects, and formerly adored her freedom. The Coloni&s;ts emigrated from you, when this part of your character was mo&s;t predominant; and they took this bia&s;s and direction the moment they parted from your hands. They are therefore not only devoted to Liberty, but to Liberty according to Engli&s;h ideas, and on Engli&s;h principles. Ab&s;tract Liberty, like other mere ab&s;tractions, is not to be found. Liberty inheres in &s;ome &s;en&s;ible object; and every nation has formed to it&s;elf &s;ome favourite point, which by way of eminence becomes the criterion of their happine&s;s. It happened, you know, Sir, that the great conte&s;ts for freedom in this country were from the earlie&s;t times chiefly upon the que&s;tion of Taxing. Mo&s;t of the conte&s;ts in the ancient commonwealths turned primarily on the right of election of magi&s;trates; or on the balance among the &s;everal orders of the &s;tate. The que&s;tion of money was not with them &s;o immediate. But in England it was otherwi&s;e. On this point of Taxes the able&s;t pens, and mo&s;t eloquent tongues have been exerci&s;ed; the greate&s;t &s;pirits have acted and &s;uffered. In order to give the fulle&s;t &s;atisfaction concerning the importance of this point, it was not only nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e who in argument defended the excellence of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, to in&s;i&s;t on this privilege of granting money as a dry point of fact, and to prove, that the right had been acknowledged in ancient parchments, and blind u&s;ages, to re&s;ide in a certain body called an Hou&s;e of Commons. They went much further; they attempted to prove, and they &s;ucceeded, that in theory it ought to be &s;o, from the particular nature of a Hou&s;e of Commons, as an immediate repre&s;entative of the people; whether the old records had delivered this oracle or not. They took infinite pains to inculcate, as a fundamental principle, that, in all monar|chies, the people mu&s;t in effect them&s;elves mediately or imme|diately po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of granting their own money, or no &s;hadow of liberty could &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The Colonies draw from you as
<PB N="17" REF="20">
with their life-blood, the&s;e ideas and principles. Their love of liberty, as with you, fixed and attached on this &s;pecific point of taxing. Liberty might be &s;afe, or might be endangered in twenty other particulars, without their being much plea&s;ed or alarmed. Here they felt its pul&s;e; and as they found that beat, they thought them&s;elves &s;ick or &s;ound. I do not &s;ay whether they were right or wrong in applying your general arguments to their own ca&s;e. It is not ea&s;y indeed to make a monopoly of theorems and corollaries. The fact is, that they did thus apply tho&s;e ge|neral arguments; and your mode of governing them, whether through lenity or indolence, through wi&s;dom or mi&s;take, con|firmed them in the imagination, that they, as well as you, had an intere&s;t in the&s;e common principles.</P>
<P>They were further confirmed in this plea&s;ing error by the form of their provincial legi&s;lative a&s;&s;emblies. Their governments are popular in an high degree; &s;ome are merely popular; in all, the popular repre&s;entative is the mo&s;t weighty; and this &s;hare of the people in their ordinary government never fails to in&s;pire them with lofty &s;entiments, and with a &s;trong aver&s;ion from whatever tends to deprive them of their chief importance.</P>
<P>If any thing were wanting to this nece&s;&s;ary operation of the form of government, Religion would have given it a complete effect. Religion, always a principle of energy, in this new people, is no way worn out or impaired; and their mode of profe&s;&s;ing it is al&s;o one main cau&s;e of this free &s;pirit. The people are prote&s;tants; and of that kind, which is the mo&s;t adver&s;e to all implicit &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion of mind and opinion. This is a per&s;ua&s;ion not only fa|vourable to liberty, but built upon it. I do not think, Sir, that the rea&s;on of this aver&s;ene&s;s in the di&s;&s;enting churches from all that looks like ab&s;olute Government is &s;o much to be &s;ought in their re|ligious tenets, as in their hi&s;tory. Every one knows, that the Roman Catholick religion is at lea&s;t coeval with mo&s;t of the governments where it prevails; that it has generally gone hand in hand with them; and received great favour and every kind of &s;upport from authority. The Church of England too was formed from her cradle under the nur&s;ing care of regular go|vernment. But the di&s;&s;enting intere&s;ts have &s;prung up in direct
<PB N="18" REF="21">
oppo&s;ition to all the ordinary powers of the world; and could ju&s;tify that oppo&s;ition only on a &s;trong claim to natural liberty. Their very exi&s;tence depended on the powerful and un|remitted a&s;&s;ertion of that claim. All prote&s;tanti&s;m, even the mo&s;t cold and pa&s;&s;ive, is a &s;ort of di&s;&s;ent. But the religion mo&s;t prevalent in our Northern Colonies is a refinement on the principle of re&s;i&s;t|ance; it is the di&s;&s;idence of di&s;&s;ent; and the prote&s;tanti&s;m of the prote&s;tant religion. This religion, under a variety of denomi|nations, agreeing in nothing but in the communion of the &s;pirit of liberty, is predominant in mo&s;t of the Northern provinces; where the Church of England, notwith&s;tanding its legal rights, is in reality no more than a &s;ort of private &s;ect, not compo&s;ing mo&s;t probably the tenth of the people. The Coloni&s;ts left England when this &s;pirit was high; and in the emigrants was the highe&s;t of all: and even that &s;tream of foreigners, which has been con&s;tantly flowing into the&s;e Colonies, has, for the greate&s;t part, been com|po&s;ed of di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;tabli&s;hments of their &s;everal coun|tries, and have brought with them a temper and character far from alien to that of the people with whom they mixed.</P>
<P>Sir, I can perceive by their manner, that &s;ome Gentlemen object to the latitude of this de&s;cription; becau&s;e in the Southern Colonies the Church of England forms a large body, and has a regular e&s;tabli&s;hment. It is certainly true. There is however a circum|&s;tance attending the&s;e Colonies, which in my opinion, fully coun|terbalances this difference, and makes the &s;pirit of liberty &s;till more high and haughty than in tho&s;e to the Northward. It is that in Virginia and the Carolinas, they have a va&s;t multitude of &s;laves. Where this is the ca&s;e in any part of the world, tho&s;e who are free, are by far the mo&s;t proud and jealous of their freedom. Freedom is to them not only an enjoyment, but a kind of rank and privilege. Not &s;eeing there, that freedom, as in countries where it is a common ble&s;&s;ing, and as broad and general as the air, may be united with much abject toil, with great mi&s;ery, with all the exterior of &s;ervitude, Liberty looks among&s;t them, like &s;omething that is more noble and liberal. I do not mean, Sir, to commend the &s;uperior morality of this &s;entiment, which has at lea&s;t as much pride as virtue in it; but I cannot alter the nature of man. The fact is &s;o; and the&s;e people of the
<PB N="19" REF="22">
Southern Colonies are much more &s;trongly, and with an higher and more &s;tubborn &s;pirit, attached to liberty than tho&s;e to the Northward. Such were all the ancient commonwealths; &s;uch were our Gothick ance&s;tors; &s;uch in our days were the Poles; and &s;uch will be all ma&s;ters of &s;laves, who are not &s;laves them|&s;elves. In &s;uch a people the haughtine&s;s of domination combines with the &s;pirit of freedom, fortifies it, and renders it invincible.</P>
<P>Permit me, Sir, to add another circum&s;tance in our Colo|nies, which contributes no mean part towards the growth and effect of this untractable &s;pirit. I mean their education. In no country perhaps in the world is the law &s;o general a &s;tudy. The profe&s;&s;ion it&s;elf is numerous and powerful; and in mo&s;t provinces it takes the lead. The greater number of the Deputies &s;ent to the Congre&s;s were Lawyers. But all who read, and mo&s;t do read, en|deavour to obtain &s;ome &s;mattering in that &s;cience. I have been told by an eminent Book&s;eller, that in no branch of his bu&s;ine&s;s, after tracts of popular devotion, were &s;o many books as tho&s;e on the Law exported to the Plantations. The Coloni&s;ts have now fallen into the way of printing them for their own u&s;e. I hear that they have &s;old nearly as many of Black&s;tone's Com|mentaries in America as in England. General Gage marks out this di&s;po&s;ition very particularly in a letter on your table. He &s;tates, that all the people in his government are lawyers, or &s;mat|terers in law; and that in Bo&s;ton they have been enabled, by &s;uc|ce&s;sful chicane, wholly to evade many parts of one of your ca|pital penal con&s;titutions. The &s;martne&s;s of debate will &s;ay, that this knowledge ought to teach them more clearly the rights of legi&s;lature, their obligations to obedience, and the penalties of re|bellion. All this is mighty well. But my <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Attorney General.</NOTE> honourable and learned friend on the floor, who conde&s;cends to mark what I &s;ay for animadver&s;ion, will di&s;dain that ground. He has heard as well as I, that when great honours and great emoluments do not win over this knowledge to the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, it is a formidable adver&s;ary to government. If the &s;pirit be not tamed
<PB N="20" REF="23">
and broken by the&s;e happy methods, it is &s;tubborn and litigious. <HI>Abeunt &s;tudia in mores.</HI> This &s;tudy renders men acute, inqui&s;itive, dextrous, prompt in attack, ready in defence, full of re&s;ources. In other countries, the people, more &s;imple and of a le&s;s mer|curial ca&s;t, judge of an ill principle in government only by an actual grievance; here they anticipate the evil, and judge of the pre&s;&s;ure of the grievance by the badne&s;s of the principle. They augur mi&s;government at a di&s;tance; and &s;nuff the approach of tyranny in every tainted breeze.</P>
<P>The la&s;t cau&s;e of this di&s;obedient &s;pirit in the Colonies is hardly le&s;s powerful than the re&s;t, as it is not merely moral, but laid deep in the natural con&s;titution of things. Three thou&s;and miles of ocean lie between you and them. No contrivance can prevent the effect of this di&s;tance, in weakening Government. Seas roll, and months pa&s;s, between the order and the execution; and the want of a &s;peedy explanation of a &s;ingle point is enough to defeat an whole &s;y&s;tem. You have, indeed, winged mini&s;ters of venge|ance, who carry your bolts in their pounces to the remote&s;t verge of the &s;ea. But there a power &s;teps in, that limits the ar|rogance of raging pa&s;&s;ions and furious elements, and &s;ays, "So far &s;halt thou go, and no farther." Who are you, that &s;hould fret and rage, and bite the chains of Nature?&mdash;Nothing wor&s;e happens to you, than does to all Nations, who have exten&s;ive Empire; and it happens in all the forms into which Empire can be thrown. In large bodies, the circulation of power mu&s;t be le&s;s vigorous at the extremities. Nature has &s;aid it. The Turk cannot govern Aegypt, and Arabia, and Curdi&s;tan, as he governs Thrace; nor has he the &s;ame dominion in Crimea and Algiers, which he has at Bru&s;a and Smyrna. De&s;poti&s;m it&s;elf is obliged to truck and huck&s;ter. The Sultan gets &s;uch obedience as he can. He governs with a loo&s;e rein, that he may govern at all; and the whole of the force and vigour of his authority in his centre, is derived from a prudent relaxation in all his borders. Spain, in her provinces, is, perhaps, not &s;o well obeyed, as you are in yours. She complies too; &s;he &s;ubmits; &s;he watches times. This is the immutable condition; the eternal Law, of exten&s;ive and detached Empire.</P>

Then, Sir, from the&s;e &s;ix capital &s;ources; of De&s;cent; of Form of Government; of Religion in the Northern Provinces; of Man|ners in the Southern; of Education; of the Remotene&s;s of Situa|tion from the Fir&s;t Mover of Government, from all the&s;e cau&s;es a fierce Spirit of Liberty has grown up. It has grown with the growth of the people in your Colonies, and encrea&s;ed with the encrea&s;e of their wealth; a Spirit, that unhappily meeting with an exerci&s;e of Power in England, which, however lawful, is not reconcileable to any ideas of Liberty, much le&s;s with theirs, has kindled this flame, that is ready to con&s;ume us.</P>
<P>I do not mean to commend either the Spirit in this exce&s;s, or the moral cau&s;es which produce it. Perhaps a more &s;mooth and accommodating Spirit of Freedom in them would be more accept|able to us. Perhaps ideas of Liberty might be de&s;ired, more reconcileable with an arbitrary and boundle&s;s authority. Perhaps we might wi&s;h the Coloni&s;ts to be per&s;uaded, that their Liberty is more &s;ecure when held in tru&s;t for them by us (as their guardians during a perpetual minority) than with any part of it in their own hands. But the que&s;tion is, not whether their &s;pirit de&s;erves prai&s;e or blame;&mdash;what, in the name of God, &s;hall we do with it? You have before you the object; &s;uch as it is, with all its glories, with all its imperfections on its head. You &s;ee the magnitude; the im|portance; the temper; the habits; the di&s;orders. By all the&s;e con|&s;iderations, we are &s;trongly urged to determine &s;omething concern|ing it. We are called upon to fix &s;ome rule and line for our future conduct, which may give a little &s;tability to our politics, and prevent the return of &s;uch unhappy deliberations as the pre|&s;ent. Every &s;uch return will bring the matter before us in a &s;till more untractable form. For, what a&s;toni&s;hing and incredible things have we not &s;een already? What mon&s;ters have not been generated from this unnatural contention? Whil&s;t every principle of authority and re&s;i&s;tance has been pu&s;hed, upon both &s;ides, as far as it would go, there is nothing &s;o &s;olid and certain, either in rea|&s;oning or in practice, that has been not &s;haken. Until very lately, all authority in America &s;eemed to be nothing but an emanation from yours. Even the popular part of the Colony Con&s;titution derived all its activity, and its fir&s;t vital movement, from the
<PB N="22" REF="25">
plea&s;ure of the Crown. We thought, Sir, that the utmo&s;t which the di&s;contented Coloni&s;ts could do, was to di&s;turb authority; we never dreamt they could of them&s;elves &s;upply it; knowing in general what an opero&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to e&s;tabli&s;h a Government ab&s;olutely new. But having, for our purpo&s;es in this contention, re&s;olved, that none but an obedient A&s;&s;embly &s;hould &s;it, the hu|mours of the people there, finding all pa&s;&s;age through the legal channel &s;topped, with great violence broke out another way. Some provinces have tried their experiment, as we have tried ours; and theirs has &s;ucceeded. They have formed a Govern|ment &s;ufficient for its purpo&s;es, without the bu&s;tle of a Revolution, or the trouble&s;ome formality of an Election. Evident nece&s;&s;ity, and tacit con&s;ent, have done the bu&s;ine&s;s in an in&s;tant. So well they have done it, that Lord Dunmore (the account is among the tragments on your table) tells you, that the new in&s;titution is in|finitely better obeyed than the antient Government ever was in its mo&s;t fortunate periods. Obedience is what makes Government, and not the names by which it is called; not the name of Gover|nor, as formerly, or Committee, as at pre&s;ent. This new Govern|ment has originated directly from the people; and was not tran&s;|mitted through any of the ordinary artificial media of a po&s;itive con&s;titution. It was not a manufacture ready formed, and tran&s;|mitted to them in that condition from England. The evil ari&s;ing from hence is this; that the Coloni&s;ts having once found the po&s;&s;i|bility of enjoying the advantages of order, in the mid&s;t of a &s;trug|gle for Liberty, &s;uch &s;truggles will not henceforward &s;eem &s;o ter|rible to the &s;ettled and &s;ober part of mankind, as they had appeared before the trial.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uing the &s;ame plan of puni&s;hing by the denial of the exerci&s;e of Government to &s;till greater lengths, we wholly abrogated the an|tient Government of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et. We were confident, that the fir&s;t feeling, if not the very pro&s;pect of anarchy, would in|&s;tantly enforce a compleat &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The experiment was tried. A new, &s;trange, unexpected face of things appeared. Anarchy is found tolerable. A va&s;t province has now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in a con&s;iderable degree of health and vigour, for near a twelve|month, without Governor, without public Council, without Judges, without executive Magi&s;trates. How long it will continue
<PB N="23" REF="26">
in this &s;tate, or what may ari&s;e out of this unheard-of &s;ituation, how can the wi&s;e&s;t of us conjecture? Our late experience has taught us, that many of tho&s;e fundamental principles, formerly believed infallible, are either not of the importance they were imagined to be; or that we have not at all adverted to &s;ome other far more important, and far more powerful principles, which entirely over-rule tho&s;e we had con&s;idered as omnipotent. I am much again&s;t any further experiments, which tend to put to the proof any more of the&s;e allowed opinions, which contribute &s;o much to the public tranquillity. In effect, we &s;uffer as much at home, by this loo&s;ening of all ties, and this concu&s;&s;ion of all e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions, as we do abroad. For, in order to prove, that the Ame|ricans have no right to their Liberties, we are every day endeavour|ing to &s;ubvert the maxims, which pre&s;erve the whole Spirit of our own. To prove that the Americans ought not to be free, we are obliged to depreciate the value of Freedom it&s;elf; and we never &s;eem to gain a paltry advantage over them in debate, without at|tacking &s;ome of tho&s;e principles, or deriding &s;ome of tho&s;e feelings, for which our ance&s;tors have &s;hed their blood.</P>
<P>But, Sir, in wi&s;hing to put an end to pernicious experiments, I do not mean to preclude the fulle&s;t enquiry. Far from it. Far from deciding on a &s;udden or partial view, I would patiently go round and round the &s;ubject, and &s;urvey it minutely in every po&s;|&s;ible a&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ct. Sir, if I were capable of engaging you to an equal attention, I would &s;tate, that, as far as I am capable of di&s;cerning, there are but three ways of proceeding relative to this &s;tubborn Spirit, which prevails in your Colonies, and di&s;turbs your Govern|ment. The&s;e are&mdash;To change that Spirit, as inconvenient, by re|moving the Cau&s;es. To pro&s;ecute it as criminal. Or, to comply with it as nece&s;&s;ary. I would not be guilty of an imperfect enu|meration; I can think of but the&s;e three. Another has indeed been &s;tarted, that of giving up the Colonies; but it met &s;o &s;light a reception, that I do not think my&s;elf obliged to dwell a great while upon it. It is nothing but a little &s;ally of anger; like the frowardne&s;s of peevi&s;h children; who, when they cannot get all they would have, are re&s;olved to take nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27">
The fir&s;t of the&s;e plans, to change the Spirit as inconvenient, by removing the cau&s;es, I think is the mo&s;t like a &s;y&s;tematick proceed|ing. It is radical in its principle; but it is attended with great difficulties, &s;ome of them little &s;hort, as I conceive, of impo&s;|&s;ibilities. This will appear by examining into the Plans which have been propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>As the growing population in the Colonies is evidently one cau&s;e of their re&s;i&s;tance, it was la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion mentioned in both Hou&s;es, by men of weight, and received not without applau&s;e, that, in order to check this evil, it would be proper for the crown to make no further grants of land. But to this &s;cheme, there are two objec|tions. The fir&s;t, that there is already &s;o much un&s;ettled land in private hands, as to afford room for an immen&s;e future population, although the crown not only withheld its grants, but annihilated its &s;oil. If this be the ca&s;e, then the only effect of this avarice of de&s;olation, this hoarding of a royal wilderne&s;s, would be to rai&s;e the value of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the hands of the great private mo|nopoli&s;ts, without any adequate check to the growing and alarm|ing mi&s;chief of population.</P>
<P>But, if you &s;topped your grants, what would be the con&s;e|quence? The people would occupy without grants. They have already &s;o occupied in many places. You cannot &s;tation garri&s;ons in every part of the&s;e de&s;erts. If you drive the people from one place, they will carry on their annual Tillage, and remove with their flocks and herds to another. Many of the people in the back &s;ettlements are already little attached to particular &s;ituations. Al|ready they have topped the Apalachian mountains. From thence they behold before them an immen&s;e plain, one va&s;t, rich, level meadow; a &s;quare of five hundred miles. Over this they would wander, without a po&s;&s;ibility of re&s;traint; they would change their manners with the habits of their life; would &s;oon forget a govern|ment, by which they were di&s;owned; would become Hordes of Engli&s;h Tartars; and, pouring down upon your unfortified frontiers a fierce and irre&s;i&s;tible cavalry, become ma&s;ters of your Governors and your Coun&s;ellors, your collectors and comptrollers, and of all the Slaves that adhered to them. Such would, and, in no long
<PB N="25" REF="28">
time, mu&s;t be, the effect of attempting to forbid as a crime, and to &s;uppre&s;s as an evil, the Command and Ble&s;&s;ing of Providence, "Encrea&s;e and Multiply." Such would be the happy re&s;ult of an endeavour to keep as a lair of wild bea&s;ts, that earth, which God, by an expre&s;s Charter, has given to the children of men. Far different, and &s;urely much wi&s;er, has been our policy hitherto. Hitherto we have invited our people by every kind of bounty, to fixed e&s;tabli&s;hments. We have invited the hu&s;bandman, to look to authority for his title. We have taught him piou&s;ly to believe in the my&s;terious virtue of wax and parchment. We have thrown each tract of land, as it was peopled, into di&s;tricts; that the ruling power &s;hould never be wholly out of &s;ight. We have &s;ettled all we could; and we have carefully attended every &s;ettlement with go|vernment.</P>
<P>Adhering, Sir, as I do, to this policy, as well as for the rea|&s;ons I have ju&s;t given, I think this new project of hedging-in popu|lation to be neither prudent nor practicable.</P>
<P>To impoveri&s;h the Colonies in general, and in particular to ar|re&s;t the noble cour&s;e of their marine enterprizes, would be a more ea&s;y ta&s;k. I freely confe&s;s it. We have &s;hewn a di&s;po&s;ition to a &s;y&s;tem of this kind; a di&s;po&s;ition even to continue the re&s;traint after the offence; looking on our&s;elves as rivals to our Colonies, and per|&s;uaded that of cour&s;e we mu&s;t gain all that they &s;hall lo&s;e. Much mi&s;chief we may certainly do. The power inadequate to all other things is often more than &s;ufficient for this. I do not look on the direct and immediate power of the Colonies to re&s;i&s;t our violence, as very formidable. In this, however, I may be mi&s;taken. But when I con&s;ider, that we have Colonies for no purpo&s;e but to be &s;erviceable to us, it &s;eems to my poor under&s;tanding a little pre|po&s;terous, to make them un&s;erviceable, in order to keep them obe|dient. It is, in truth, nothing more than the old, and, as I thought, exploded problem of tyranny, which propo&s;es to beggar its &s;ubjects into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But, remember, when you have compleated your &s;y&s;tem of impoveri&s;hment, that Nature &s;till proceeds in her or|dinary cour&s;e; that di&s;content will encrea&s;e with mi&s;ery; and that there are critical moments in the fortune of all &s;tates, when they,
<PB N="26" REF="29">
who are too weak to contribute to your pro&s;perity, may be &s;trong enough to complete your ruin. <HI>Spoliatis arma &s;uper&s;unt.</HI></P>
<P>The temper and character which prevail in our Colonies, are, I am afraid, unalterable by any human art. We cannot, I fear, fal&s;ify the pedigree of this fierce people, and per&s;uade them that they are not &s;prung from a nation, in who&s;e veins the blood of freedom circulates. The language in which they would hear you tell them this tale, would detect the impo&s;ition; your &s;peech would betray you. An Engli&s;hman is the un&s;itte&s;t per&s;on on earth, to argue another Engli&s;hman into &s;lavery.</P>
<P>I think it is nearly as little in our power to change their repub|lican Religion, as their free de&s;cent; or to &s;ub&s;titute the Roman Catholick, as a penalty; or the Church of England, as an im|provement. The mode of inqui&s;ition and dragoouing, is going out of fa&s;hion in the old world; and I &s;hould not confide much to their efficacy in the new. The education of the Americans is al&s;o on the &s;ame unalterable bottom with their religion. You cannot per|&s;uade them to burn their books of curious &s;cience; to bani&s;h their lawyers from their courts of law; or to quench the lights of their a&s;&s;emblies, by refu&s;ing to choo&s;e tho&s;e per&s;ons who are be&s;t read in their privileges. It would be no le&s;s impracticable to think of wholly annihilating the popular a&s;&s;emblies, in which the&s;e lawyers &s;it. The army, by which we mu&s;t govern in their place, would be far more chargeable to us; not quite &s;o effectual; and perhaps, in the end, full as difficult to be kept in obedience.</P>
<P>With regard to the high ari&s;tocratick &s;pirit of Virginia and the &s;outhern Colonies, it has been propo&s;ed, I know, to reduce it, by declaring a general enfranchi&s;ement of their &s;hwes. This project has had its advocates and panegyri&s;ts; yet I never could argue my&s;elf into any opinion of it. Slaves are often much attached to their ma&s;ters. A general wild offer of liberty, would not always be accepted. Hi&s;tory furni&s;hes few in&s;tances of it. It is &s;ometimes as hard to per&s;uade &s;laves to be free, as it is to compel freemen to be &s;laves; and in this au&s;picious &s;cheme, we &s;hould have both the&s;e plea&s;ing ta&s;ks on our hands at once. But when we talk of en|franchi&s;ement, do we not perceive that the American ma&s;ter may
<PB N="27" REF="30">
enfranchi&s;e too; and arm &s;ervile hands in defence of freedom? A mea&s;ure to which other people have had recour&s;e more than once, and not without &s;ucce&s;s, in a de&s;perate &s;ituation of their affairs.</P>
<P>Slaves as the&s;e unfortunate black people are, and dull as all men are from &s;lavery, mu&s;t they not a little &s;u&s;pect the offer of freedom from that very nation which has &s;old them to their pre&s;ent ma&s;ters? From that nation, one of who&s;e cau&s;es of quarrel with tho&s;e ma&s;ters, is their refu&s;al to deal any more in that inhuman traffick? An offer of freedom from England, would come rather oddly, &s;hipped to them in an African ve&s;&s;el, which is refu&s;ed an entry into the ports of Virginia or Carolina, with a cargo of three hundred Angola ne|groes. It would be curious to &s;ee the Guinea captain attempting at the &s;ame in&s;tant to publi&s;h his proclamation of liberty, and to ad|verti&s;e his &s;ale of &s;laves.</P>
<P>But let us &s;uppo&s;e all the&s;e moral difficulties got over. The Ocean remains. You cannot pump this dry; and as long as it con|tinues in its pre&s;ent bed, &s;o long all the cau&s;es which weaken au|thority by di&s;tance will continue. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ye gods, annihilate but &s;pace and time, and make two lovers happy!&mdash;"</Q>was a pious and pa&s;|&s;ionate prayer;&mdash;but ju&s;t as rea&s;onable, as many of the &s;erious wi&s;hes of very grave and &s;olemn politicians.</P>
<P>If then, Sir, it &s;eems almo&s;t de&s;perate to think of any alterative cour&s;e, for changing the moral cau&s;es (and not quite ea&s;y to re|move the natural), which produce prejudices irreconcileable to the late exerci&s;e of our authority; but that the &s;pirit infallibly will continue; and, continuing, will produce &s;uch effects, as now em|barra&s;s us; the &s;econd mode under con&s;ideration is, to pro&s;ecute that &s;pirit in its overt acts, as <HI>criminal.</HI></P>
<P>At this propo&s;ition, I mu&s;t pau&s;e a moment. The thing &s;eems a great deal too big for my ideas of juri&s;prudence. It &s;hould &s;eem, to my way of conceiving &s;uch matters, that there is a very wide difference in rea&s;on and policy, between the mode of proceeding on the irregular conduct of &s;cattered individuals, or even of bands of men, who di&s;turb order within the &s;tate, and the civil di&s;|&s;en&s;ions which may, from time to time, on great que&s;tions, agitate
<PB N="28" REF="31">
the &s;everal communities which compo&s;e a great Empire. It looks to me to be narrow and pedantic, to apply the ordinary ideas of criminal ju&s;tice to this great public conte&s;t. I do not know the method of drawing up an indictment again&s;t an whole people. I cannot in&s;ult and ridicule the feelings of Millions of my fellow|creatures, as Sir Edward Coke in&s;ulted one excellent individual (Sir Walter Rawleigh) at the bar. I am not ripe to pa&s;s &s;entence on the grave&s;t public bodies, entru&s;ted with magi&s;tracies of great au|thority and dignity, and charged with the &s;afety of their fellow|citizens, upon the very &s;ame title that I am. I really think, that for wi&s;e men, this is not judicious; for &s;ober men, not decent; for minds tinctured with humanity, not mild and merciful.</P>
<P>Perhaps, Sir, I am mi&s;taken in my idea of an Empire, as di&s;|tingui&s;hed from a &s;ingle State or Kingdom. But my idea of it is this; that an Empire is the aggregate of many States, under one common head; whether this head be a monarch, or a pre&s;iding re|public. It does, in &s;uch con&s;titutions, frequently happen (and nothing but the di&s;mal, cold, dead uniformity of &s;ervitude can prevent its happening) that the &s;ubordinate parts have many local privileges and immunities. Between the&s;e privileges, and the &s;u|preme common authority, the line may be extremely nice. Of cour&s;e di&s;putes, often too, very bitter di&s;putes, and much ill blood, will ari&s;e. But though every privilege is an exemption (in the ca&s;e) from the ordinary exerci&s;e of the &s;upreme authority, it is no denial of it. The claim of a privilege &s;eems rather, <HI>ex vi termini,</HI> to imply a &s;uperior power. For to talk of the privileges of a State or of a per&s;on, who has no &s;uperior, is hardly any better than &s;peaking non&s;en&s;e. Now, in &s;uch unfortunate quarrels, among the compo|nent parts of a great political union of communities, I can &s;carce|ly conceive any thing more compleatly imprudent, than for the Head of the Empire to in&s;i&s;t, that, if any privilege is pleaded again&s;t his will, or his acts, that his whole authority is denied; in&s;tantly to proclaim rebellion, to beat to arms, and to put the offending provinces under the ban. Will not this, Sir, very &s;oon teach the provinces to make no di&s;tinctions on their part? Will it not teach them that the Government, again&s;t which a claim of Liberty is tantamont to high-trea&s;on, is a Government to which &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="29" REF="32">
is equivalent to &s;lavery? It may not always be quite convenient to impre&s;s dependent communities with &s;uch an idea.</P>
<P>We are, indeed, in all di&s;putes with the Colonies, by the nece&s;|&s;ity of things, the judge. It is true, Sir. But, I confe&s;s, that the character of judge in my own cau&s;e, is a thing that frightens me. In&s;tead of filling me with pride, I am exceedingly humbled by it. I cannot proceed with a &s;tern, a&s;&s;ured, judicial confidence, until I find my&s;elf in &s;omething more like a judicial character. I mu&s;t have the&s;e he&s;itations as long as I am compelled to recol|lect, that, in my little reading upon &s;uch conte&s;ts as the&s;e, the &s;en&s;e of mankind has, at lea&s;t, as often decided again&s;t the &s;upe|rior as the &s;ubordinate power. Sir, let me add too, that the opinion of my having &s;ome ab&s;tract right in my favour, would not put me much at my ea&s;e in pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence; unle&s;s I could be &s;ure, that there were no rights which, in their exerci&s;e under certain cir|cum&s;tances, were not the mo&s;t odious of all wrongs, and the mo&s;t vexatious of all inju&s;tice. Sir, the&s;e con&s;iderations have great weight with me, when I find things &s;o circum&s;tanced; that I &s;ee the &s;ame party, at once a civil litigant again&s;t me in a point of right; and a culprit before me, while I &s;it as a criminal judge, on acts of his, who&s;e moral quality is to be decided upon the merits of that very litigation. Men are every now and then put, by the complexity of human affairs, into &s;trange &s;ituations; but Ju&s;tice is the &s;ame, let the Judge be in what &s;ituation he will.</P>
<P>There is, Sir, al&s;o a circum&s;tance which convinces me, that this mode of criminal proceeding is not (at lea&s;t in the pre&s;ent &s;tage of our conte&s;t) altogether expedient; which is nothing le&s;s than the conduct of tho&s;e very per&s;ons who have &s;eemed to adopt that mode, by lately declaring a rebellion in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay, as they had formerly addre&s;&s;ed to have Traitors brought hither under an act of Henry the Eighth, for Trial. For though rebellion is de|clared, it is not proceeded again&s;t as &s;uch; nor have any &s;teps been taken towards the apprehen&s;ion or conviction of any individual offender, either on our late or our former addre&s;s; but modes of public coercion have been adopted, and &s;uch as have much more re&s;emblance to a &s;ort of qualified ho&s;tility towards an independant power than the puni&s;hment of rebellious &s;ubjects. All this &s;eems
<PB N="30" REF="33">
rather incon&s;i&s;tent; but it &s;hews how difficult it is to apply the&s;e juridical ideas to our pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, let us &s;eriou&s;ly and coolly ponder. What is it we have got by all our menaces, which have been many and fero|cious? What advantage have we derived from the penal laws we have pa&s;&s;ed, and which, for the time, have been &s;evere and numerous? What advances have we made towards our object, by the &s;ending of a force, which, by land and &s;ea, is no contemptible &s;trength? Has the di&s;order abated? Nothing le&s;s.&mdash;When I &s;ee things in this &s;ituation, after &s;uch confident hopes, bold promi&s;es, and active exertions, I cannot, for my life, avoid a &s;u&s;picion, that the plan it&s;elf is not correctly right.</P>
<P>If then the removal of the cau&s;es of this Spirit of American Li|berty be, for the greater part, or rather entirely, impracticable; if the ideas of Criminal Proce&s;s be inapplicable, or, if applicable, are in the highe&s;t degree inexpedient, what way yet remains? No way is open, but the third and la&s;t&mdash;to comply with the American Spirit as nece&s;&s;ary; or, if you plea&s;e, to &s;ubmit to it, as a nece&s;&s;ary Evil.</P>
<P>If we adopt this mode; if we mean to conciliate and concede; let us &s;ee of what nature the conce&s;&s;ion ought to be? To a&s;cer|tain the nature of our conce&s;&s;ion, we mu&s;t look at their complaint. The Colonies complain, that they have not the characteri&s;tic Mark and Seal of Briti&s;h Freedom. They complain, that they are taxed in a Parliament, in which they are not repre&s;ented. If you mean to &s;atisfy them at all, you mu&s;t &s;atisfy them with regard to this complaint. If you mean to plea&s;e any people, you mu&s;t give them the boon which they a&s;k; not what you may think better for them, but of a kind totally different. Such an act may be a wi&s;e regulation, but it is no conce&s;&s;ion: whereas our pre&s;ent theme is the mode of giving &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Sir, I think you mu&s;t perceive, that I am re&s;olved this day to have nothing at all to do with the que&s;tion of the right of taxation. Some gentlemen &s;tartle&mdash;but it is true: I put it totally out of the que&s;tion. It is le&s;s than nothing in my con&s;ideration. I do not indeed wonder, nor will you, Sir, that gentlemen of profound
<PB N="31" REF="34">
learning are fond of di&s;playing it on this profound &s;ubject. But my con&s;ideration is narrow, confined, and wholly limited to the Policy of the que&s;tion. I do not examine, whether the giving away a man's money be a power excepted and re&s;erved out of the general tru&s;t of Government; and how far all mankind, in all forms of Polity, are intitled to an exerci&s;e of that Right by the Charter of Nature. Or whether, on the contrary, a Right of Taxation is nece&s;&s;arily involved in the general principle of Legi&s;lation, and in|&s;eparable from the ordinary Supreme Power? The&s;e are deep que&s;|tions, where great names militate again&s;t each other; where rea&s;on is perplexed; and an appeal to authorities only thickens the confu|&s;ion. For high and reverend authorities lift up their heads on both &s;ides; and there is no &s;ure &s;ooting in the middle. This point is the <HI>great Serbonian bog, betwixt Damiata and Mount Ca&s;ius old, where armies whole have &s;unk.</HI> I do not intend to be overwhelmed in that bog, though in &s;uch re&s;pectable company. The que&s;tion with me is, not whether you have a right to render your people mi&s;erable; but whether it is not your intere&s;t to make them happy? It is not, what a lawyer tells me, I <HI>may</HI> do; but what humanity, rea&s;on, and ju&s;tice, tells me, I ought to do. Is a politic act the wor&s;e for being a generous one? Is no conce&s;&s;ion proper, but that which is made from your want of right to keep what you grant? Or does it le&s;&s;en the grace or dignity of relaxing in the exerci&s;e of an odious claim, becau&s;e you have your evidence-room full of Titles, and your magazines &s;tuffed with arms to enforce them? What &s;ignify all tho&s;e titles, and all tho&s;e arms? Of what avail are they, when the rea&s;on of the thing tells me, that the a&s;&s;ertion of my title is the lo&s;s of my &s;uit; and that I could do nothing but wound my&s;elf by the u&s;e of my own weapons?</P>
<P>Such is &s;tedfa&s;tly my opinion of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of keep|ing up the concord of this empire by a Unity of Spirit, though in a diver&s;ity of operations, that, if I were &s;ure the Coloni&s;ts had, at their leaving this country, &s;ealed a regular compact of &s;ervitude; that they had &s;olemnly abjured all the rights of citizens; that they had made a vow to renounce all Ideas of Liberty for them and their po&s;terity, to all generations; yet I &s;hould hold my&s;elf obliged to conform to the temper I found univer&s;ally pre|valent in my own day, and to govern two million of men, impatient

of Servitude, on the principles of Freedom. I am not deter|mining a point of law; I am re&s;toring tranquillity; and the general character and &s;ituation of a people mu&s;t determine what &s;ort of go|vernment is fitted for them. That point nothing el&s;e can or ought to determine.</P>
<P>My idea therefore, without con&s;idering whether we yield as matter of right, or grant as matter of favour, is <HI>to admit the people of our Colonies into an intere&s;t in the con&s;titution;</HI> and, by recording that admi&s;&s;ion in the Journals of Parliament, to give them as &s;trong an a&s;&s;urance as the nature of the thing will admit, that we mean for ever to adhere to that &s;olemn declaration of &s;y&s;tematic indulgence.</P>
<P>Some years ago, the repeal of a revenue act, upon its under&s;tood principle, might have &s;erved to &s;hew, that we intended an un|conditional abatement of the exerci&s;e of a Taxing Power. Such a mea&s;ure was then &s;ufficient to remove all &s;u&s;picion; and to give perfect content. But unfortunate events, &s;ince that time, may make &s;omething further nece&s;&s;ary; and not more nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;a|tisfaction of the Colonies, than for the dignity and con&s;i&s;tency of our own future proceedings.</P>
<P>I have taken a very incorrect mea&s;ure of the di&s;po&s;ition of the Hou&s;e, if this propo&s;al in it&s;elf would be received with di&s;like. I think, Sir, we have few American Financiers. But our misfor|tune is, we are too actute; we are too exqui&s;ite in our conjectures of the future, for men oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch great and pre&s;ent evils. The more moderate among the oppo&s;ers of Parliamentary Conce&s;|&s;ion freely confe&s;s, that they hope no good from Taxation; but they apprehend the Coloni&s;ts have further views; and if this point were conceded, they would in&s;tantly attack the Trade-laws. The&s;e Gentlemen are convinced, that this was the intention from the beginning; and the quarrel of the Americans with Taxation was no more than a cloke and cover to this de&s;ign. Such has been the language even of a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rice.</NOTE> Gentleman of real moderation, and of a natural temper well adju&s;ted to fair and equal Government. I am, however,
<PB N="33" REF="36">
Sir, not a little &s;urprized at this kind of di&s;cour&s;e, whenever I hear it; and I am the more &s;urprized, on account of the arguments which I con&s;tantly find in company with it, and which are often urged from the &s;ame mouths, and on the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, when we alledge, that it is again&s;t rea&s;on to tax a people under &s;o many re&s;traints in trade as the Americans, the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord North.</NOTE> Noble Lord in the blue ribband &s;hall tell you, that the re&s;traints on trade are futile and u&s;ele&s;s; of no advantage to us, and of no burthen to tho&s;e on whom they are impo&s;ed; that the trade to America is not &s;ecured by the acts of navigation, but by the natural and irre&s;i&s;tible advantage of a commercial preference.</P>
<P>Such is the merit of the trade laws in this po&s;ture of the debate. But when &s;trong internal circum&s;tances are urged again&s;t the taxes; when the &s;cheme is di&s;&s;ected; when experience and the nature of things are brought to prove, and do prove, the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of obtaining an effective revenue from the Colonies; when the&s;e things are pre&s;&s;ed, or rather pre&s;s them&s;elves, &s;o as to drive the advocates of Colony taxes to a clear admi&s;&s;ion of the futility of the &s;cheme; then, Sir, the &s;leeping trade laws revive from their trance; and this u&s;ele&s;s taxation is to be kept &s;acred, not for its own &s;ake, but as a counterguard and &s;ecurity of the laws of trade.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, you keep up revenue laws which are mi&s;chievous, in order to pre&s;erve trade laws that are u&s;ele&s;s. Such is the wi&s;dom of our plan in both its members. They are &s;eparately given up as of no value; and yet one is always to be defended for the &s;ake of the other. But I cannot agree with the Noble Lord, nor with the pamphlet from whence he &s;eems to have borrowed the&s;e ideas, concerning the inutility of the trade laws. For without idolizing them, I am &s;ure they are &s;till, in many ways, of great u&s;e to us; and in former times, they have been of the greate&s;t. They do confine, and they do greatly narrow, the market for the Ame|ricans. But my perfect conviction of this, does not help me in the lea&s;t to di&s;cern how the revenue laws form any &s;ecurity what|&s;oever to the commercial regulations; or that the&s;e commercial re|gulations
<PB N="34" REF="37">
are the true ground of the quarrel; or, that the giving way in any one in&s;tance of authority, is to lo&s;e all that may re|main unconceded.</P>
<P>One fact is clear and indi&s;putable. The public and avowed origin of this quarrel, was on taxation. This quarrel has indeed brought on new di&s;putes on new que&s;tions; but certainly the lea&s;t bitter, and the fewe&s;t of all, on the trade laws. To judge which of the two be the real radical cau&s;e of quarrel, we have to &s;ee whe|ther the commercial di&s;pute did, in order of time, precede the di&s;|pute on taxation? There is not a &s;hadow of evidence for it. Next, to enable us to judge whether at this moment a di&s;like to the Trade Laws be the real cau&s;e of quarrel, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to put the taxes out of the que&s;tion by a repeal. See how the Americans act in this po&s;ition, and then you will be able to di&s;|cern correctly what is the true object of the controver&s;y, or whe|ther any controver&s;y at all will remain? Unle&s;s you con&s;ent to remove this cau&s;e of difference, it is impo&s;&s;ible, with decency, to a&s;&s;ert that the di&s;pute is not upon what it is avowed to be. And I would, Sir, recommend to your &s;erious con&s;ideration, whe|ther it be prudent to form a rule for puni&s;hing people, not on their own acts, but on your conjectures? Surely it is prepo&s;terous at the very be&s;t. It is not ju&s;tifying your anger, by their mi&s;|conduct; but it is converting your ill-will into their delinquency.</P>
<P>But the Colonies will go further.&mdash;Alas! alas! when will this &s;peculating again&s;t fact and rea&s;on end? What will quiet the&s;e panick fears which we entertain of the ho&s;tile effect of a con|ciliatory conduct? Is it true, that no ca&s;e can exi&s;t, in which it is proper for the &s;overeign to accede to the de&s;ires of his di&s;contented &s;ubjects? Is there any thing peculiar in this ca&s;e, to make a rule for it&s;elf? Is all authority of cour&s;e lo&s;t, when it is not pu&s;hed to the extreme? Is it a certain maxim, that, the fewer cau&s;es of di&s;|&s;atisfaction are left by government, the more the &s;ubject will be inclined to re&s;i&s;t and rebel?</P>
<P>All the&s;e objections being in fact no more than &s;u&s;picions, con|jectures, divinations; formed in defiance of fact and experience; they did not, Sir, di&s;courage me from entertaining the idea of a
<PB N="35" REF="38">
conciliatory conce&s;&s;ion, founded on the principles which I have ju&s;t &s;tated.</P>
<P>In forming a plan for this purpo&s;e, I endeavoured to put my&s;elf in that frame of mind, which was the mo&s;t natural, and the mo&s;t rea&s;onable; and which was certainly the mo&s;t probable means of &s;ecuring me from all error. I &s;et out with a perfect di&s;tru&s;t of my own abilities; a total renunciation of every &s;peculation of my own; and with a profound reverence for the wi&s;dom of our ance&s;|tors, who have left us the inheritance of &s;o happy a con&s;titution, and &s;o flouri&s;hing an empire, and what is a thou&s;and times more valuable, the trea&s;ury of the maxims and principles which formed the one, and obtained the other.</P>
<P>During the reigns of the kings of Spain of the Au&s;trian family, whenever they were at a lo&s;s in the Spani&s;h councils, it was common for their &s;tate&s;men to &s;ay, that they ought to con&s;ult the genius of Philip the Second. The genius of Philip the Second might mi&s;lead them; and the i&s;&s;ue of their affairs &s;hewed, that they had not cho&s;en the mo&s;t perfect &s;tandard. But, Sir, I am &s;ure that I &s;hall not be mi&s;led, when, in a ca&s;e of con&s;titutional difficulty, I con&s;ult the genius of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. Con|&s;ulting at that oracle (it was with all due humility and piety) I found four capital examples in a &s;imilar ca&s;e before me: tho&s;e of Ireland, Wales, Che&s;ter, and Durham.</P>
<P>Ireland, before the Engli&s;h conque&s;t, though never governed by a de&s;potick power, had no Parliament. How far the Engli&s;h Parliament it&s;elf was at that time modelled, according to the pre|&s;ent form, is di&s;puted among antiquarians. But we have all the rea&s;on in the world to be a&s;&s;ured, that a form of Parliament, &s;uch as England then enjoyed, &s;he in&s;tantly communicated to Ireland; and we are equally &s;ure that almo&s;t every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive improvement in con&s;titutional liberty, as fa&s;t as it was made here, was tran&s;mitted thither. The feudal Baronage, and the feudal Knighthood, the roots of our primitive con&s;titution, were early tran&s;planted into that &s;oil; and grew and flouri&s;hed there. Magna Charta, if it did not give us originally the Hou&s;e of Commons, gave us at lea&s;t an Hou&s;e of Commons of weight and con&s;equence. But
<PB N="36" REF="39">
your ance&s;tors did not churli&s;hly &s;it down alone to the fea&s;t of Magna Charta. Ireland was made immediately a partaker. This benefit of Engli&s;h laws and liberties, I confe&s;s, was not at fir&s;t ex|tended to <HI>all</HI> Ireland. Mark the con&s;equence. Engli&s;h authority and Engli&s;h liberties, had exactly the &s;ame boundaries. Your &s;tandard could never be advanced an inch before your privileges. Sir John Davis &s;hews beyond a doubt, that the refu&s;al of a general communication of the&s;e rights, was the true cau&s;e why Ireland was five hundred years in &s;ubduing; and after the vain projects of a Military Government, attempted in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, it was &s;oon di&s;covered, that nothing could make that country Engli&s;h, in civility and allegiance, but your laws and your forms of legi&s;lature. It was not Engli&s;h arms, but the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, that conquered Ireland. From that time, Ireland has ever had a general Parliament, as &s;he had before a partial Parlia|ment. You changed the people; you altered the religion; but you never touched the form or the vital &s;ub&s;tance of free government in that kingdom. You depo&s;ed kings; you re&s;tored them; you al|tered the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to theirs, as well as to your own crown; but you never altered their con&s;titution; the principle of which was re&s;pected by u&s;urpation; re&s;tored with the re&s;toration of Monarchy, and e&s;tabli&s;hed, I tru&s;t, for ever, by the glorious Revolution. This has made Ireland the great and flouri&s;hing kingdom that it is; and from a di&s;grace and a burthen intolerable to this nation, has rendered her a principal part of our &s;trength and ornament. This country cannot be &s;aid to have ever formally taxed her. The irre|gular things done in the confu&s;ion of mighty troubles, and on the hinge of great revolutions, even if all were done that is &s;aid to have been done, form no example. If they have any effect in ar|gument, they make an exception to prove the rule. None of your own liberties could &s;tand a moment, if the ca&s;ual deviations from them, at &s;uch times, were &s;uffered to be u&s;ed as proofs of their nul|lity. By the lucrative amount of &s;uch ca&s;ual breaches in the con|&s;titution, judge what the &s;tated and fixed rule of &s;upply has been in that Kingdom. Your Iri&s;h pen&s;ioners would &s;tarve, if they had no other fund to live on than taxes granted by Engli&s;h authority. Turn your eyes to tho&s;e popular grants from whence all your great &s;upplies are come; and learn to re&s;pect that only &s;ource of publick wealth in the Briti&s;h empire.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="40">
My next example is Wales. This country was &s;aid to be re|duced by Henry the Third. It was &s;aid more truly to be &s;o by Edward the Fir&s;t. But though then conquered, it was not looked upon as any part of the realm of England. Its old con&s;titution, whatever that might have been, was de&s;troyed; and no good one was &s;ub&s;tituted in its place. The care of that tract was put into the hands of Lords Marchers&mdash;a form of Government of a very &s;ingular kind; a &s;trange heterogeneous mon&s;ter, &s;omething between Ho&s;tility and Government; perhaps it has a &s;ort of re&s;emblance, according to the modes of tho&s;e times, to that of commander in chief at pre&s;ent, to whom all civil power is granted as &s;econdary. The manners of the Wel&s;h nation, followed the Genius of the Go|vernment: The people were ferocious, re&s;tive, &s;avage, and unculti|vated; &s;ometimes compo&s;ed, never pacified. Wales within it&s;elf, was in perpetual di&s;order; and it kept the frontier of England in perpetual alarm. Benefits from it to the &s;tate, there were none. Wales was only known to England, by incur&s;ion and inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir, during that &s;tate of things, Parliament was not idle. They attempted to &s;ubdue the fierce &s;pirit of the Wel&s;h by all &s;orts of rigorous laws. They prohibited by &s;tatute the &s;ending all &s;orts of arms into Wales, as you prohibit by proclamation (with &s;ome|thing more of doubt on the legality) the &s;ending arms to America. They di&s;armed the Wel&s;h by &s;tatute, as you attempted (but &s;till with more que&s;tion on the legality) to di&s;arm New England by an in&s;truction. They made an act to drag offenders from Wales into England for trial, as you have done (but with more hard|&s;hip) with regard to America. By another act, where one of the parties was an Engli&s;hman, they ordained, that his trial &s;hould be always by Engli&s;h. They made acts to re&s;train trade, as you do; and they prevented the Wel&s;h from the u&s;e of fairs and markets, as you do the Americans from fi&s;heries and foreign ports. In &s;hort, when the &s;tatute-book was not quite &s;o much &s;welled as it is now, you find no le&s;s than fifteen acts of penal regulation on the &s;ubject of Wales.</P>
<P>Here we rub our hands&mdash;A fine body of precedents for the au|thority of Parliament and the u&s;e of it!&mdash;I admit it fully; and pray
<PB N="38" REF="41">
add likewi&s;e to the&s;e precedents, that all the while, Wales rid this kingdom like an <HI>incubus;</HI> that it was an unpro&s;itable and oppre&s;&s;ive burthen; and that an Engli&s;hman travelling in that country, could not go fix yards from the high road without being murdered.</P>
<P>The march of the human mind is flow. Sir, it was not, until after Two Hundred years, di&s;covered, thatby an eternal law, Pro|vidence had decreed vexation to violence; and poverty to rapine. Your ance&s;tors did however at length open their eyes to the ill hu&s;|bandry of inju&s;tice. They found that the tyranny of a free people could of all tyrannies the lea&s;t be endured; and that laws made again&s;t an whole nation were not the mo&s;t effectual methods for &s;ecuring its obedience. Accordingly, in the Twenty-&s;eventh year of Henry VIII. the cour&s;e was entirely altered. With a preamble &s;tating the entire and perfect rights of the crown of England, it gave to the Wel&s;h all the rights and privileges of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects. A political order was e&s;tabli&s;hed; the military power gave way to the civil; the marches were turned into counties. But that a na|tion &s;hould have a right to Engli&s;h liberties, and yet no &s;hare at all in the fundamental &s;ecurity of the&s;e liberties, the grant of their own property, &s;eemed a thing &s;o incongruous; that Eight years after, that is, in the Thirty-fifth of that reign, a complete and not ill propor|tioned repre&s;entation by counties and boroughs was be&s;towed upon Wales, by act of Parliament. From that moment, as by a charm, the tumults &s;ub&s;ided; obedience was re&s;tored; peace, order, and civilization, followed in the train of liberty&mdash;When the day-&s;tar of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution had ari&s;en in their hearts, all was harmony within and without&mdash;<Q><L>Simul alba nautis</L>

<P>The very &s;ame year the county palatine of Che&s;ter received the &s;ame relief from its oppre&s;&s;ions, and the &s;ame remedy to its di&s;|orders. Before this time Che&s;ter was little le&s;s di&s;tempered than
<PB N="39" REF="42">
Wales. The inhabitants, without rights them&s;elves, were the fitte&s;t to de&s;troy the rights of others; and from thence Richard II. drew the &s;tanding army of Archers, with which for a time he op|pre&s;&s;ed England. The people of Che&s;ter applied to Parliament in a petition penned as I &s;hall read to you:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>To the King our Sovereign Lord, in mo&s;t humble wi&s;e &s;hewn unto your Excellent Maje&s;ty, the inhabitants of your Grace's county palatine of Che&s;ter; That where the &s;aid county palatine of Che&s;ter is and hath been always hitherto exempt, excluded and &s;eparated out and from your high court of parliament, to have any knights and burge&s;&s;es within the &s;aid court; by rea&s;on whereof the &s;aid inhabitants have hitherto &s;u&s;tained manifold di&s;heri&s;ons, lo&s;&s;es and damages, as well in their lands, goods, and bodies, as in the good, civil, and politick governance and mainte|nance of the commonwealth of their &s;aid country: (2.) And for as much as the &s;aid inhabitants have always hitherto been bound by the acts and &s;tatutes made and ordained by your &s;aid highne&s;s, and your mo&s;t noble progenitors, by authority of the &s;aid court, as far forth as other coun|ties, cities, and boroughs have been, that have had their knights and burge&s;&s;es within your &s;aid court of parliament, and yet have had neither knight ne burge&s;s there for the &s;aid county palatine; the &s;aid inhabitants, for lack thereof, have been oftentimes touched and grieved with acts and &s;tatutes made within the &s;aid court, as well derogatory unto the mo&s;t antient juri&s;dictions, liberties, and privileges of your &s;aid county palatine, as prejudicial unto the common wealth, quietne&s;s, re&s;t, and peace of your grace's mo&s;t bounden &s;ubjects inhabiting within the &s;ame.</HI></Q></P>
<P>What did Parliament with this audacious addre&s;s?&mdash;reject it as a libel? Treat it as an affront to government? Spurn it as a deroga|tion from the rights of legi&s;lature? Did they to&s;s it over the table? Did they burn it by the hands of the common hangman?&mdash;They took the petition of grievance, all rugged as it was, without &s;often|ing or temperament, unpurged of the original bitterne&s;s and indig|nation of complaint; they made it the very preamble to their act of redre&s;s; and con&s;ecrated its principle to all ages in the &s;anctuary of legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>Here is my third example. It was attended with the &s;ucce&s;s of the two former. Che&s;ter, civilized as well as Wales, has demon|&s;trated
<PB N="40" REF="43">
that freedom and not &s;ervitude is the cure of anarchy; as re|ligion, and not athei&s;m, is the true remedy for &s;uper&s;tition. Sir, this pattern of Che&s;ter was followed in the reign of Charles II. with regard to the county palatine of Durham, which is my fourth example. This county had long lain out of the pale of free legi&s;la|tion. So &s;crupulou&s;ly was the example of Che&s;ter followed, that the &s;tyle of the preamble is nearly the &s;ame with that of the Che&s;ter act; and without affecting the ab&s;tract extent of the authority of Parliament, it recognizes the equity of not &s;uffering any con&s;iderable di&s;trict in which the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects may act as a body, to be taxed without their own voice in the grant.</P>
<P>Now if the doctrines of policy contained in the&s;e preambles, and the force of the&s;e examples in the acts of Parliament, avail any thing, what can be &s;aid again&s;t applying them with regard to America? Are not the people of America as much Engli&s;hmen as the Wel&s;h? The preamble of the act of Henry VIII. &s;ays, the Wel&s;h &s;peak a language no way re&s;embling that of his Maje&s;ty's Engli&s;h &s;ubjects. Are the Americans not as numerous? If we may tru&s;t the learned and accurate Judge Barrington's account of North Wales, and take that as a &s;tandard to mea&s;ure the re&s;t, there is no compari&s;on. The people cannot amount to above 200,000; not a tenth part of the number in the Colonies. Is America in rebellion? Wales was hardly ever free from it. Have you attempted to govern America by penal &s;tatutes? You made Fifteen for Wales. But your legi&s;lative authority is perfect with regard to America; was it le&s;s perfect in Wales, Che&s;ter, and Durham? But America is virtually repre&s;ented. What! does the electric force of virtual repre&s;entation more ea&s;ily pa&s;s over the Atlantic, than pervade Wales, which lies in your neighbourhood; or than Che&s;ter and Durham &s;urrounded by abundance of repre&s;entation that is actual and palpable? But, Sir, your ance&s;tors thought this &s;ort of virtual repre&s;entation, however ample, to be totally in&s;ufficient for the freedom of the inhabitants of territories that are &s;o near, and comparatively &s;o incon&s;iderable. How then can I think it &s;uffi|cient for tho&s;e which are infinitely greater, and infinitely more remote?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="44">
You will now, Sir, perhaps imagine, that I am on the point of propo&s;ing to you a &s;cheme for a repre&s;entation of the Colonies in Parliament. Perhaps I might be inclined to entertain &s;ome &s;uch thought; but a great flood &s;tops me in my cour&s;e. <HI>Oppo&s;uit natura</HI>&mdash;I cannot remove the eternal barriers of the creation. The thing in that mode, I do not know to be po&s;&s;ible. As I meddle with no theory, I do not ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;ert the impracticability of &s;uch a repre&s;entation. But I do not &s;ee my way to it; and tho&s;e who have been more confident, have not been more &s;ucce&s;sful. However, the arm of public benevolence is not &s;hortened; and there are often &s;everal means to the &s;ame end. What nature has disjoined in one way, wi&s;dom may unite in another. When we cannot give the benefit as we would wi&s;h, let us not refu&s;e it altogether. If we cannot give the principal, let us find a &s;ub&s;titute. But how? Where? What &s;ub&s;titute?</P>
<P>Fortunately I am not obliged for the ways and means of this &s;ub&s;titute to tax my own unproductive invention. I am not even obliged to go to the rich trea&s;ury of the fertile framers of imaginary commonwealths; not to the Republick of Plato, not to the Utopia of More; not to the Oceana of Harrington. It is before me&mdash;It is at my feet, <HI>and the rude &s;wain treads daily on it with his clouted &s;hoon.</HI> I only wi&s;h you to recognize, for the theory, the ancient con&s;titutional policy of this kingdom with regard to repre&s;entation, as that policy has been declared in acts of parliament; and, as to the practice, to return to that mode which an uniform experience has marked out to you, as be&s;t; and in which you walked with &s;ecurity, advantage, and honour, until the year 1763.</P>
<P>My re&s;olutions therefore mean to e&s;tabli&s;h the equity and ju&s;tice of a taxation of America, by <HI>grant,</HI> and not by <HI>impo&s;ition.</HI> To mark the <HI>legal competency</HI> of the Colony a&s;&s;emblies for the &s;upport of their government in peace, and for public aids in time of war.

The&s;e &s;olid truths compo&s;e fix fundamental propo&s;itions. There are three more re&s;olutions corollary to the&s;e. If you admit the fir&s;t &s;et, you can hardly reject the others.

I think the&s;e &s;ix ma&s;&s;ive pillars will be of &s;trength &s;ufficient to &s;upport the temple of Briti&s;h concord. I have no more doubt than I entertain of my exi&s;tence, that, if you admitted the&s;e, you would command an immediate peace; and with but tolerable fu|ture management, a la&s;ting obedience in America. I am not ar|rogant in this confident a&s;&s;urance. The propo&s;itions are all mere matters of fact; and if they are &s;uch facts as draw irre&s;i&s;tible con|clu&s;ions even in the &s;tating, this is the power of truth, and not any management of mine.</P>
<P>Sir, I &s;hall open the whole plan to you together, with &s;uch ob|&s;ervations on the motions as may tend to illu&s;trate them where they may want explanation. The fir&s;t is a re&s;olution&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That the Colo|nies and Plantations of Great Britain in North America, con&s;i&s;ting of Fourteen &s;eparate Governments, and containing Two Millions and upwards of free inhabitants, have not had the liberty and privilege of electing and &s;ending any Knights and Burge&s;&s;es, or others to repre|&s;ent them in the high Court of Parliament.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;This is a plain mat|ter of fact, nece&s;&s;ary to be laid down, and (excepting the de|&s;cription) it is laid down in the language of the con&s;titution; it is taken nearly <HI>verbatim</HI> from acts of Parliament.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is like unto the fir&s;t&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That the &s;aid Colonies and Plantations have been liable to, and bounden by, &s;everal &s;ub&s;idies, payments, rates, and taxes, given and granted by Parliament, though the &s;aid Colonies and Plantations have not their Knights and Bur|ge&s;&s;es, in the &s;aid high Court of Parliament, of their own election, to repre&s;ent the condition of their country; by lack whereof they have been oftentimes touched and grieved by &s;ub&s;idies given, granted, and a&s;&s;ented to, in the &s;aid court, in a manner prejudicial to the com|mon wealth, quietne&s;s, re&s;t, and peace, of the &s;ubjects inhabiting within the &s;ame.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="46">
Is this de&s;cription too hot, or too cold, too &s;trong, or too weak? Does it arrogate too much to the &s;upreme legi&s;lature? Does it lean too much to the claims of the people? If it runs into any of the&s;e errors, the fault is not mine. It is the language of your own an|cient acts of Parliament. <HI>Non meus hic &s;ermo, &s;ed quae praecepit Ofellus, ruflicus, abnormis &s;apiens.</HI> It is the genuine produce of the ancient ru&s;tick, manly, home-bred &s;en&s;e of this country&mdash;I did not dare to rub off a particle of the venerable ru&s;t that ra|ther adorns and pre&s;erves, than de&s;troys the metal. It would be a profanation to touch with a tool the &s;tones which con&s;truct the &s;acred altar of peace. I would not violate with modern poli&s;h the ingenuous and noble roughne&s;s of the&s;e truly con&s;titutional mate|rials. Above all things, I was re&s;olved not to be guilty of tampering, the odious vice of re&s;tle&s;s and un&s;table minds. I put my foot in the tracks of our forefathers; where I can neither wander nor &s;tumble. Determining to fix articles of peace, I was re&s;olved not to be wi&s;e beyond what was written; I was re&s;olved to u&s;e nothing el&s;e than the form of &s;ound words; to let others abound in their own &s;en&s;e; and carefully to ab&s;tain from all expre&s;&s;ions of my own. What the law has &s;aid, I &s;ay. In all things el&s;e I am &s;ilent. I have no organ but for her words. This, if it be not ingenious, I am &s;ure is &s;afe.</P>
<P>There are indeed words expre&s;&s;ive of grievance in this &s;econd re|&s;olution, which tho&s;e who are re&s;olved always to be in the right, will deny to contain matter of fact, as applied to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; although Parliament thought them true, with regard to the counties of Che&s;ter and Durham. They will deny that the Americans were ever "touched and grieved" with the taxes. If they con&s;ider nothing in taxes but their weight as pecuniary impo&s;itions, there might be &s;ome pretence for this denial. But men may be &s;orely touched and deeply grieved in their privileges, as well as in their pur&s;es. Men may lo&s;e little in property by the act which takes away all their freedom. When a man is robbed of a trifle on the highway, it is not the Two-pence lo&s;t that con&s;titutes the capital outrage. This is not confined to privileges. Even ancient indulgences withdrawn, without offence on the part of tho&s;e who enjoyed &s;uch favours, ope|rate as grievances. But were the Americans then not touched and
<PB N="44" REF="47">
grieved by the taxes, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, merely as taxes? If &s;o, why were they almo&s;t all, either wholly repealed or exceedingly re|duced? Were they not touched and grieved, even by the regulating Duties of the Sixth of George II? El&s;e why were the duties fir&s;t reduced to one Third in 1764, and afterwards to a Third of that Third in the year 1766? Were they not touched and grieved by the Stamp Act? I &s;hall &s;ay they were, until that tax is revived. Were they not touched and grieved by the duties of 1767, which were likewi&s;e repealed, and which, Lord Hill&s;borough tells you (for the mini&s;try) were laid contrary to the true principle of commerce? Is not the a&s;&s;urance given by that noble per&s;on to the Colonies of a re&s;olution to lay no more taxes on them, an admi&s;&s;ion that taxes would touch and grieve them? Is not the re&s;olution of the noble Lord in the blue ribband, now &s;tanding on your Journals, the &s;tronge&s;t of all proofs that parliamentary &s;ub&s;idies really touched and grieved them? El&s;e, why all the&s;e changes, modifications, re|peals, a&s;&s;urances, and re&s;olutions?</P>
<P>The next propo&s;ition is&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That, from the di&s;tance of the &s;aid Colonies, and from other circum&s;tances, no method hath hitherto been devi&s;ed for procuring are pre&s;entation in Parliament for the &s;aid Colo|nies.</HI>"</Q> This is an a&s;&s;ertion of a fact. I go no further on the pa|per; though in my private judgement, an u&s;eful repre&s;entation is impo&s;&s;ible; I am &s;ure it is not de&s;ired by them; nor ought it perhaps by us; but I ab&s;tain from opinions.</P>
<P>The fourth re&s;olution is&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That each of the &s;aid Colonies hath within it&s;elf a body, cho&s;en in part, or in the whole, by the freemen, freebolders, or other free inhabitants thereof, commonly called the General A&s;&s;embly, or General Court, with powers legalty to rai&s;e, levy, and a&s;&s;e&s;s, according to the &s;everal u&s;age of &s;uch Colonies, duties and taxes towards defraying all &s;orts of public &s;ervices.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>This competence in the Colony a&s;&s;emblies is certain. It is proved by the whole tenour of their acts of &s;upply in all the a&s;&s;emblies, in which the con&s;tant &s;tyle of granting is, "an aid to his Maje&s;ty;" and acts granting to the Crown have regularly for near a century pa&s;&s;ed the public offices without

di&s;pute. Tho&s;e who have been plea&s;ed paradoxically to deny this right, holding that none but the Briti&s;h parliament can grant to the Crown, are wi&s;hed to look to what is done, not only in the Colonies, but in Ireland, in one uniform unbroken tenour every &s;e&s;&s;ion. Sir, I am &s;urprized, that this doctrine &s;hould come from &s;ome of the law &s;ervants of the Crown. I &s;ay, that if the Crown could be re&s;pon&s;ible, his Maje&s;ty&mdash;but certainly the mini&s;ters, and even the&s;e law officers them&s;elves, through who&s;e hands the acts pa&s;s, bien|nially in Ireland, or annually in the Colonies, are in an habitual cour&s;e of committing impeachable offences.

However, they are &s;afe; as no one impeaches them; and there is no ground of charge again&s;t them, except in their own unfounded theories.</P>

<P>Sir, here is the repeated acknowledgement of Parliament, that the Colonies not only gave, but gave to &s;atiety. This nation has formally acknowledged two things; fir&s;t, that the Colonies had gone beyond their abilities, Parliament having thought it nece&s;&s;ary to reimbur&s;e them; &s;econdly, that they had acted legally and laud|ably in their grants of money, and their maintenance of troops, &s;ince the compen&s;ation is expre&s;sly given as reward and encouragement.
<PB N="47" REF="50">
Reward is not be&s;towed for acts that are unlawful; and en|couragement is not held out to things that de&s;erve reprehen|&s;ion. My re&s;olution therefore does nothing more than collect into one propo&s;ition, what is &s;cattered through your Journals. I give you nothing but your own; and you cannot refu&s;e in the gro&s;s, what you have &s;o often acknowledged in detail. The admi&s;&s;ion of this, which will be &s;o honourable to them and to you, will, in|deed, be mortal to all the mi&s;erable &s;tories, by which the pa&s;&s;ions of the mi&s;guided people have been engaged in an unhappy &s;y&s;tem. The people heard, indeed, from the beginning of the&s;e di&s;putes, one thing continually dinned in their ears, that rea&s;on and ju&s;tice de|manded, that the Americans, who paid no Taxes, &s;hould be com|pelled to contribute. How did that fact of their paying nothing, &s;tand, when the Taxing Sy&s;tem began? When Mr. Grenville be|gan to form his &s;y&s;tem of American Revenue, he &s;tated in this Hou&s;e, that the Colonies were then in debt two millions &s;ix hun|dred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling money; and was of opinion they would di&s;charge that debt in four years. On this &s;tate, tho&s;e untaxed people were actually &s;ubject to the payment of taxes to the amount of &s;ix hundred and fifty thou&s;and a year. In fact, however, Mr. Grenville was mi&s;taken. The funds given for &s;inking the debt did not prove quite &s;o ample as both the Colonies and he expected. The calculation was too &s;anguine: the reduction was not compleated till &s;ome years after, and at different times in different Colonies. How|ever, the Taxes after the war, continued too great to bear any ad|dition, with prudence or propriety; and when the burthens im|po&s;ed in con&s;equence of former requi&s;itions were di&s;charged, our tone became too high to re&s;ort again to requi&s;ition. No Colony, &s;ince that time, ever has had any requi&s;ition what&s;oever made to it.</P>
<P>We &s;ee the &s;en&s;e of the Crown, and the &s;en&s;e of Parliament, on the productive nature of a <HI>Revenue by Grant.</HI> Now &s;earch the &s;ame Journals for the produce of the <HI>Revenue by Impo&s;ition</HI>&mdash;Where is it?&mdash;let us know the volume and the page?&mdash;what is the gro&s;s, what is the nett produce?&mdash;to what &s;ervice is it applied?&mdash;how have you appropriated its &s;urplus?&mdash;What, can none of the many &s;kilful Index-makers, that we are now employing, find any trace of it?&mdash;Well, let them and that re&s;t together.&mdash;But are the Journals, which &s;ay nothing of the Revenue, as &s;ilent on the

di&s;content?&mdash;Oh no! a child may find it. It is the melancholy burthen and blot of every page.</P>
<P>I think then I am, from tho&s;e Journals, ju&s;tified in the &s;ixth and la&s;t re&s;olution which is&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That it hath been found by experience, that the manner of granting the &s;aid &s;upplies and aids, by the &s;aid General A&s;&s;emblies, hath been more agreeable to the &s;aid Colonies, and more beneficial, and conducive to the public &s;ervice, than the mode of giving and granting aids in Parliament, to be rai&s;ed and paid in the &s;aid Colonies.</HI>"</Q> This makes the whole of the funda|mental part of the plan. The conclu&s;ion is irre&s;i&s;tible. You can|not &s;ay, that you were driven by any nece&s;&s;ity, to an exerci&s;e of the utmo&s;t Rights of Legi&s;lature. You cannot a&s;&s;ert, that you took on your&s;elves the ta&s;k of impo&s;ing Colony Taxes, from the want of another legal body, that is competent to the purpo&s;e of &s;upply|ing the Exigencies of the State without wounding the prejudices of the people. Neither is it true that the body &s;o qualified, and having that competence, had neglected the duty.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion now, on all this accumulated matter, is;&mdash;whether you will chu&s;e to abide by a profitable experience, or a mi&s;chievous theory; whether you chu&s;e to build on imagination or fact; whe|ther you prefer enjoyment or hope; &s;atisfaction in your &s;ubjects, or di&s;content?</P>
<P>If the&s;e propo&s;itions are accepted, every thing which has been made to enforce a contrary &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t, I take it for granted, fall along with it. On that ground, I have drawn the following re&s;olution, which, when it comes to be moved, will naturally be divided in a proper manner: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That it may be proper to repeal an act, made in the &s;eventh year of the reign of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, in|tituled, An act for granting certain duties in the Briti&s;h Colonies and Plantations in America; for allowing a drawback of the duties of cu&s;toms upon the exportation from this Kingdom, of coffee and cocoa|nuts of the produce of the &s;aid Colonies or Plantations; for di&s;con|tinuing the drawbacks payable on China Earthen-ware exported to America; and for more effectually preventing the clande&s;tine running of goods in the &s;aid Colonies and Plantations.&mdash;And that it may be proper to repeal an act, made in the fourteenth year of the reign of</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="52">
<HI>his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, intituled, An act to di&s;continue, in &s;uch manner, and for &s;uch time, as are therein mentioned, the landing and di&s;|charging, lading or &s;hipping, of goods, wares, and merchandize, at the town and within the harbour of Bo&s;ton, in the Province of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;et's Bay, in North America.&mdash;And that it may be proper to repeal an act, made in the fourteenth year of the reign of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, intituled, An act for the impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in the ca&s;es of per&s;ons que&s;tioned for any acts done by them, in the exe|cution of the law, or for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of riots and tumults, in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay in New England&mdash;And that it may be proper to repeal an act, made in the fourteenth year of the reign of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, intituled, An act for the better regulating the Government of the province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay in New England.&mdash;And al&s;o that it may be proper to explain and amend an act, made in the thirty-fifth year of the reign of King Henry the Eighth, intituled, An act for the Trial of Trea&s;ons committed out of the King's Dominions.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>I wi&s;h, Sir, to repeal the Bo&s;ton Port Bill, becau&s;e (independently of the dangerous precedent of &s;u&s;pending the rights of the &s;ubject during the King's plea&s;ure) it was pa&s;&s;ed, as I apprehend, with le&s;s re|gularity, and on more partial principles, than it ought. The corpo|ration of Bo&s;ton was not heard, before it was condemned. Other towns, full as guilty as &s;he was, have not had their ports blocked up. Even the Re&s;training Bill of the pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion does not go to the length of the Bo&s;ton Port Act. The &s;ame ideas of prudence, which in|duced you not to extend equal puni&s;hment to equal guilt, even when you were puni&s;hing, induce me, who mean not to cha&s;ti&s;e, but to recon|cile, to be &s;atisfied with the puni&s;hment already partially inflicted.</P>
<P>Ideas of prudence, and accommodation to circum&s;tances, pre|vent you from taking away the Charters of Connecticut and Rhode-i&s;land, as you have taken away that of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Co|lony, though the Crown has far le&s;s power in the two former pro|vinces than it enjoyed in the latter; and though the abu&s;es have been full as great, and as flagrant, in the exempted as in the puni&s;hed. The &s;ame rea&s;ons of prudence and accommodation have weight with me in re&s;toring the Charter of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay. Be&s;ides, Sir, the Act which changes the Charter of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's is in
<PB N="50" REF="53">
many particulars &s;o exceptionable, that, if I did not wi&s;h ab|&s;olutely to repeal, I would by all means de&s;ire to alter it; as &s;everal of its provi&s;ions tend to the &s;ubver&s;ion of all public and private ju&s;tice. Such, among others, is the power in the Go|vernor to change the &s;heriff at his plea&s;ure; and to make a new returning officer for every &s;pecial cau&s;e. It is &s;hameful to behold &s;uch a regulation &s;tanding among Engli&s;h Laws.</P>
<P>The act for bringing per&s;ons accu&s;ed of committing murder under the orders of Government to England for Trial, is but temporary. That act has calculated the probable duration of our quarrel with the Colonies; and is accommodated to that &s;uppo&s;ed duration. I would ha&s;ten the happy moment of reconciliation; and therefore mu&s;t, on my principle, get rid of that mo&s;t ju&s;tly obnoxious act.</P>
<P>The act of Henry the Eighth, for the Trial of Trea&s;ons, I do not mean to take away, but to confine it to its proper bounds and original intention; to make it expre&s;sly for Trial of Trea&s;ons (and the greate&s;t Trea&s;ons may be committed) in places where the juri&s;|diction of the Crown does not extend.</P>
<P>Having guarded the privileges of Local Legi&s;lature, I would next &s;ecure to the Colonies a fair and unbia&s;&s;ed Judicature; for which purpo&s;e, Sir, I propo&s;e the following re&s;olution: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That, from the time when the General A&s;&s;embly or General Court of any Colony or Plantation in North America, &s;hall have appointed by act of A&s;|&s;embly, duly confirmed, a &s;ettled &s;alary to the offices of the Chief Ju&s;tice and other Judges of the Superior Court, it may be proper, that the &s;aid Chief Ju&s;tice and other Judges of the Superior Courts of &s;uch Colony, &s;hall hold his and their office and offices during their good behaviour; and &s;hall not be removed therefrom, but when the &s;aid removal &s;hall be adjudged by his Maje&s;ty in Council, upon a hearing on complaint from the General A&s;&s;embly, or on a complaint from the Governor, or Council, or the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives &s;everally, of the Colony in which the &s;aid Chief Ju&s;tice and other Judges have exerci&s;ed the &s;aid offices.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The next re&s;olution relates to the Courts of Admiralty.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="54">
It is this. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That it may be proper to regulate the Courts of Ad|miralty, or Vice Admirally, authorized by the 15th Chap. of the 4th of George the Third, in &s;uch a manner as to make the &s;ame more com|modious to tho&s;e who &s;ue, or are &s;ued in the &s;aid Courts, and to pro|vide for the more decent maintenance of the Judges in the &s;ame.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Courts I do not wi&s;h to take away; they are in them|&s;elves proper e&s;tabli&s;hments. This Court is one of the capital &s;ecurities of the Act of Navigation. The extent of its juri&s;diction, indeed, has been encrea&s;ed; but this is altogether as proper, and is, indeed, on many accounts, more eligible, where new powers were wanted, than a Court ab&s;olutely new. But Courts incommo|diou&s;ly &s;ituated, in effect, deny ju&s;tice; and a Court, partaking in the fruits of its own condemnation, is a robber. The congre&s;s complain, and complain ju&s;tly, of this grievance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Solicitor-general informed Mr. B. when the re&s;olutions were &s;eparately moved, that the grievance of the judges partaking of the profits of the &s;eizure had been redre&s;&s;ed by office; accordingly the re&s;olution was amended.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the three con&s;equential propo&s;itions. I have thought of two or three more; but they come rather too near detail, and to the province of executive Government, which I wi&s;h Parliament always to &s;uperintend, never to a&s;&s;ume. If the fir&s;t &s;ix are granted, congruity will carry the latter three. If not, the things that remain unrepealed, will be, I hope, rather un&s;eemly incumbrances on the building, than very materially detrimental to its &s;trength and &s;tability.</P>
<P>Here, Sir, I &s;hould clo&s;e; but that I plainly perceive &s;ome ob|jections remain, which I ought, if po&s;&s;ible, to remove. The fir&s;t will be, that, in re&s;orting to the doctrine of our ance&s;tors, as con|tained in the preamble to the Che&s;ter act, I prove too much; that the grievance from a want of repre&s;entation, &s;tated in that preamble goes to the whole of Legi&s;lation as well as to Taxation. And that the Colonies grounding them&s;elves upon that doctrine, will apply it to all parts of Legi&s;lative Authority.</P>
<P>To this objection, with all po&s;&s;ible deference and humility, and wi&s;hing as little as any man living to impair the &s;malle&s;t particle of

our &s;upreme authority, I an&s;wer, that <HI>the words are the words of Parliament, and not mine;</HI> and, that all fal&s;e and inconclu&s;ive inferences, drawn from them, are not mine; for I heartily di&s;|claim any &s;uch inference.

It is true that Lord Chatham con&s;idered the&s;e preambles as de|claring &s;trongly in favour of his opinions. He was a no le&s;s pow|erful advocate for the privileges of the Americans. Ought I not from hence to pre&s;ume, that the&s;e preambles are as favourable as po&s;&s;ible to both, when properly under&s;tood; favourable both to the rights of Parliament, and to the privilege of the dependencies of this crown? But, Sir, the object of grievance in my re&s;olution, I have not taken from the Che&s;ter, but from the Durham act, which confines the hard&s;hip of want of repre&s;entation, to the ca&s;e of &s;ub&s;idies; and which therefore falls in exactly with the ca&s;e of the Colonies. But whether the unrepre&s;ented counties were <HI>de jure,</HI> or <HI>de facto,</HI> bound, the preambles do not accurately di&s;tingui&s;h; nor indeed was it nece&s;&s;ary; for, whether <HI>de jure,</HI> or <HI>de facto,</HI> the Le|gi&s;lature thought the exerci&s;e of the power of taxing, as of right, or as of fact without right, equally a grievance and equally oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>I do not know, that the Colonies have, in any general way, or in any cool hour, gone much beyond the demand of immunity in relation to taxes. It is not fair to judge of the temper or di&s;po|&s;itions of any man, or any &s;et of men, when they are compo&s;ed and at re&s;t, from their conduct, or their expre&s;&s;ions, in a &s;tate of di&s;turbance and irritation. It is be&s;ides a very great mi&s;take to imagine, that mankind follow up practically, any &s;peculative principle either of government, or of freedom, as far as it will go in ar|gument and logical illation. We Engli&s;hmen, &s;top very &s;hort of the principles upon which we &s;upport any given part of our con|&s;titution; or even the whole of it together. I could ea&s;ily, if I had not already tired you, give you very &s;triking and convincing in|&s;tances of it. This is nothing but what is natural and proper. All government, indeed every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue, and every prudent act, is founded on compromi&s;e and barter. We balance inconveniencies; we give and take; we remit &s;ome
<PB N="53" REF="56">
rights, that we may enjoy others; and, we chu&s;e rather to be happy citizens, than &s;ubtle di&s;putants. As we mu&s;t give away &s;ome natural liberty, to enjoy civil advantages; &s;o we mu&s;t &s;acrifice &s;ome civil liberties, for the advantages to be derived from the communion and fellow&s;hip of a great empire. But in all fair dealings the thing bought, mu&s;t bear &s;ome proportion to the purcha&s;e paid. None will barter away the immediate jewel of his &s;oul. Though a great hou&s;e is apt to make &s;laves haughty, yet it is purcha&s;ing a part of the artificial importance of a great empire too dear, to pay for it all e&s;&s;ential rights, and all the intrin&s;ic dignity of human nature. None of us who would not ri&s;que his life, rather than fall under a government purely arbitrary. But, although there are &s;ome among&s;t us who think our con&s;titution wants many im|provements, to make it a complete &s;y&s;tem of liberty, perhaps none who are of that opinion, would think it right to aim at &s;uch improvement, by di&s;turbing his country, and ri&s;quing every thing that is dear to him. In every arduous enterprize, we con|&s;ider what we are to lo&s;e, as well as what we are to gain; and the more and better &s;take of liberty every people po&s;&s;e&s;s, the le&s;s they will hazard in a vain attempt to make it more. The&s;e are <HI>the cords of man.</HI> Man acts from adequate motives relative to his in|tere&s;t; and not on metaphy&s;ical &s;peculations. Ari&s;totle, the great ma&s;ter of rea&s;oning, cautions us, and with great weight and pro|priety, again&s;t this &s;pecies of delu&s;ive geometrical accuracy in moral arguments, as the mo&s;t fallacious of all &s;ophi&s;try.</P>
<P>The Americans will have no intere&s;t contrary to the grandeur and glory of England, when they are not oppre&s;&s;ed by the weight of it; and they will rather be inclined to re&s;pect the acts of a &s;uperintending legi&s;lature; when they &s;ee them the acts of that power, which is it&s;elf the &s;ecurity, not the rival, of their &s;econ|dary importance. In this a&s;&s;urance, my mind mo&s;t perfectly ac|quie&s;ces; and I confe&s;s, I feel not the lea&s;t alarm, from the di&s;|contents which are to ari&s;e, from putting people at their ea&s;e; nor do I apprehend the de&s;truction of this empire, from giving, by an act of free grace and indulgence, to two millions of my fellow citizens, &s;ome &s;hare of tho&s;e rights, upon which I have always been taught to value my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="57">
It is &s;aid indeed, that this power of granting ve&s;ted in American a&s;&s;emblies, would di&s;&s;olve the unity of the empire; which was pre|&s;erved, entire, although Wales, and Che&s;ter, and Durham, were added to it. Truly, Mr. Speaker, I do not know what this unity means: nor has it ever been heard of, that I know, in the con&s;ti|tutional policy of this country. The very idea of &s;ubordination of parts, excludes this notion of &s;imple and undivided unity. England is the head; but &s;he is not the head and the members too. Ireland has ever had from the beginning a &s;eparate, but not an independent, le|gi&s;lature; which, far from di&s;tracting, promoted the union of the whole. Every thing was &s;weetly and harmoniou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed through both I&s;lands for the con&s;ervation of Engli&s;h dominion, and the com|mun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">cation of Engli&s;h liberties. I do not &s;ee that the &s;ame princi|ples might not be carried into twenty I&s;lands, and with the &s;ame good effect. This is my model with regard to America, as far as the internal circum&s;tances of the two countries are the &s;ame. I know no other unity of this empire, than I can draw from its example during the&s;e periods, when it &s;eemed to my poor un|der&s;tanding more united than it is now, or than it is likely to be by the pre&s;ent methods.</P>
<P>But &s;ince I &s;peak of the&s;e methods, I recollect, Mr. Speaker, al|mo&s;t too late, that I promi&s;ed, before I fini&s;hed, to &s;ay &s;omething of the propo&s;ition of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord North.</NOTE> Noble Lord on the floor, which has been &s;o lately received, and &s;tands on your Journals. I mu&s;t be deeply concerned, whenever it is my misfortune to continue a dif|ference with the majority of this hou&s;e. But as the rea&s;ons for that difference are my apology for thus troubling you, &s;uffer me to &s;tate them in a very few words. I &s;hall compre&s;s them into as &s;mall a body as I po&s;&s;ibly can, having already debated that matter at large, when the que&s;tion was before the committee.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, I cannot admit that propo&s;ition of a ran&s;om by auction;&mdash;becau&s;e it is a meer project. It is a thing new; un|heard of; &s;upported by no experience; ju&s;tified by no analogy; without example of our ance&s;tors, or root in the con&s;titution. It is neither regular parliamentary taxation, nor Colony grant.
<PB N="55" REF="58">
<HI>Experimentum in corpore vili,</HI> is a good rule, which will ever make me adver&s;e to any trial of experiments on what is certainly the mo&s;t valuable of all &s;ubjects; the peace of this Empire.</P>
<P>Secondly, it is an experiment which mu&s;t be fatal in the end to our con&s;titution. For what is it but a &s;cheme for taxing the Colo|nies in the antichamber of the Noble Lord and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors? To &s;ettle the quotas and proportions in this hou&s;e, is clearly impo&s;&s;ible. You, Sir, may flatter your&s;elf, you &s;hall &s;it a &s;tate auctioneer with your hammer in our hand, and knock down to each Colony as it bids. But to &s;ettle (on the plan laid down by the Noble Lord) the true proportional payment for four or five and twenty govern|ments, according to the ab&s;olute and the relative wealth of each, and according to the Briti&s;h proportion of wealth and burthen, is a wild and chimerical notion. This new taxation mu&s;t therefore come in by the back-door of the con&s;titution. Each quota mu&s;t be brought to this Hou&s;e ready formed; you can neither add nor alter. You mu&s;t regi&s;ter it. You can do nothing further. For on what grounds can you deliberate either before or after the pro|po&s;ition? You cannot hear the coun&s;el for all the&s;e Provinces, quarrelling each on its own quantity of payment, and its proportion to others. If you &s;hould attempt it, the Committee of Provincial Ways and Means, or by whatever other name it will delight to be called, mu&s;t &s;wallow up all the time of Parliament.</P>
<P>Thirdly, it does not give &s;atisfaction to the complaint of the Colonies. They complain, that they are taxed without their con|&s;ent; you an&s;wer, that you will fix the &s;um at which they &s;hall be taxed. That is, you give them the very grievance for the re|medy. You tell them indeed, that you will leave the mode to them&s;elves. I really beg pardon: it gives me pain to mention it; but you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that you will not perform this part of the compact. For, &s;uppo&s;e the Colonies were to lay the duties which furni&s;hed their Contingent, upon the importation of your manufactures; you know you would never &s;uffer &s;uch a tax to be laid. You know too, that you would not &s;uffer many other modes of taxation. So that, when you come to explain your|&s;elf, it will be found, that you will neither leave to them&s;elves the
<PB N="56" REF="59">
quantum nor the mode; nor indeed any thing. The whole is delu&s;ion from one end to the other.</P>
<P>Fourthly, this method of ran&s;om by auction, unle&s;s it be <HI>uni|ver&s;ally</HI> accepted, will plunge you into great and inextricable diffi|culties. In what year of our Lord are the proportions of payments to be &s;ettled? To &s;ay nothing of the impo&s;&s;ibility that Colony agents &s;hould have general powers of taxing the Colonies at their di&s;cretion; con&s;ider, I implore you, that the communication by &s;pecial me&s;&s;ages, and orders between the&s;e agents and their con|&s;tituents on each variation of the ca&s;e, when the parties come to contend together, and to di&s;pute on their relative proportions, will be a matter of delay, perplexity, and confu&s;ion, that never can have an end.</P>
<P>If all the Colonies do not appear at the outcry, what is the con|dition of tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, who offer, by them&s;elves or their agents, to tax them&s;elves up to your ideas of their proportion? The re|fractory Colonies, who refu&s;e all compo&s;ition, will remain taxed only to your old impo&s;itions; which, however grievous in principle, are trifling as to production. The obedient Colonies in this &s;cheme are heavily taxed; the refractory remain unburthened. What will you do? Will you lay new and heavier taxes by Parliament on the di&s;obedient? Pray con&s;ider in what way you can do it? You are perfectly convinced that in the way of taxing, you can do no|thing but at the ports. Now &s;uppo&s;e it is Virginia that refu&s;es to appear at your auction, while Maryland and North Carolina bid hand&s;omely for their ran&s;om, and are taxed to your quota? How will you put the&s;e Colonies on a par? Will you tax the tobacco of Virginia? If you do, you give its death-wound to your Engli&s;h revenue at home, and to one of the very greate&s;t articles of your own foreign trade. If you tax the import of that rebellious Co|lony, what do you tax but your own manufactures, or the goods of &s;ome other obedient, and already well-taxed Colony? Who has &s;aid one word on this labyrinth of detail, which bewilders you more and more as you enter into it? Who has pre&s;ented, who can pre|&s;ent you, with a clue, to lead you out of it? I think, Sir, it is impo&s;&s;ible, that you &s;hould not recollect that the Colony bounds are &s;o implicated in one another (you know it by your other
<PB N="57" REF="60">
experiments in the Bill for prohibiting the New-England fi&s;hery) that you can lay no po&s;&s;ible re&s;traints on almo&s;t any of them which may not be pre&s;ently eluded, if you do not confound the in|nocent with the guilty, and burthen tho&s;e whom upon every prin|ciple, you ought to exonerate. He mu&s;t be gro&s;ly ignorant of America, who thinks, that, without falling into this confu&s;ion of all rules of equity and policy, you can re&s;train any &s;ingle Colony, e&s;pecially Virginia and Maryland, the central, and mo&s;t important of them all.</P>
<P>Let it al&s;o be con&s;idered, that, either in the pre&s;ent confu&s;ion you &s;ettle a permanent contingent, which will and mu&s;t be trifling; and then you have no effectual revenue: or you change the quota at every exigency; and then on every new repartition you will have a new quarrel.</P>
<P>Reflect be&s;ides, that when you have fixed a quota for every Colony, you have not provided for prompt and punctual payment. Suppo&s;e one, two, five, ten years arrears. You cannot i&s;&s;ue a trea&s;ury extent again&s;t the failing Colony. You mu&s;t make new Bo&s;ton port bills, new re&s;training laws, new Acts for dragging men to England for trial. You mu&s;t &s;end out new fleets, new armies. All is to begin again. From this day forward the Empire is never to know an hour's tranquillity. An inte&s;tine fire will be kept alive in the bowels of the Colonies, which one time or other mu&s;t con&s;ume this whole empire. I allow indeed that the empire of Germany rai&s;es her revenue and her troops by quotas and con|tingents; but the revenue of the empire, and the army of the empire, is the wor&s;t revenue, and the wor&s;t army, in the world.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of a &s;tanding revenue, you will therefore have a per|petual quarrel. Indeed the noble Lord, who propo&s;ed this pro|ject of a ran&s;om by auction, &s;eemed him&s;elf to be of that opinion. His project was rather de&s;igned for breaking the union of the Colo|nies, than for e&s;tabli&s;hing a Revenue. He confe&s;&s;ed, he apprehended that his propo&s;al would not be to <HI>their ta&s;te.</HI> I &s;ay, this &s;cheme of di&s;union &s;eems to be at the bottom of the project; for I will not &s;u&s;pect that the noble Lord meant nothing but merely to delude the nation by an airy phantom which he never intended to realize.
<PB N="58" REF="61">
But whatever his views may be; as I propo&s;e the peace and union of the Colonies as the very foundation of my plan, it cannot accord with one who&s;e foundation is perpetual di&s;cord.</P>
<P>Compare the two. This I offer to give you is plain and &s;imple. The other full of perplexed and intricate mazes. This is mild; that har&s;h. This is found by experience effectual for its purpo&s;es; the other is a new project. This is univer&s;al; the other calculated for certain Colonies only. This is immediate in its conciliatory operation; the other remote, contingent, full of hazard. Mine is what becomes the dignity of a ruling people; gratuitous, uncon|ditional, and not held out as matter of bargain and &s;ale. I have done my duty in propo&s;ing it to you. I have indeed tired you by a long di&s;cour&s;e; but this is the misfortune of tho&s;e to who&s;e in|fluence nothing will be conceded, and who mu&s;t win every inch of their ground by argument. You have heard me with goodne&s;s. May you decide with wi&s;dom! For my part, I feel my mind greatly di&s;burthened, by what I have done to-day. I have been the le&s;s fearful of trying your patience, becau&s;e on this &s;ubject I mean to &s;pare it alto|gether in future. I have this comfort, that in every &s;tage of the American affairs, I have &s;teadily oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ures that have produced the confu&s;ion, and may bring on the de&s;truction, of this empire. I now go &s;o far as to ri&s;que a propo&s;al of my own. If I cannot give peace to my country; I give it to my con&s;cience.</P>
<P>But what (&s;ays the Financier) is peace to us without money? Your plan gives us no Revenue. No! But it does&mdash;For it &s;ecures to the &s;ubject the power of REFUSAL; the fir&s;t of all Revenues. Experience is a cheat, and fact a liar, if this power in the &s;ubject of proportioning his grant, or of not granting at all, has not been found the riche&s;t mine of Revenue ever di&s;covered by the &s;kill or by the fortune of man. It does not indeed vote you &pound; 152, 750: 11: 2 &frac14; ths. nor any other paltry limited &s;um.&mdash;But it gives the &s;trong box it&s;elf, the fund, the bank, from whence only revenues can ari&s;e among&s;t a people &s;en&s;ible of freedom: <HI>Po&s;ita luditur arca.</HI> Cannot you in England; cannot you at this time of day; cannot you, an Hou&s;e of Commons, tru&s;t to the principle which has rai&s;ed &s;o mighty a revenue, and accumulated a debt of near 140 millions in this country? Is this principle to be true in
<PB N="59" REF="62">
England, and fal&s;e every where el&s;e? Is it not true in Ireland? Has it not hitherto been true in the Colonies? Why &s;hould you pre&s;ume that, in any country, a body duly con&s;tituted for any function, will neglect to perform its duty, and abdicate its tru&s;t? Such a pre&s;umption would go again&s;t all government in all modes. But, in truth, this dread of penury of &s;upply, from a free a&s;&s;embly, has no foundation in nature. For fir&s;t ob&s;erve, that, be&s;ides the de&s;ire which all men have naturally of &s;upporting the honour of their own government; that &s;en&s;e of dignity, and that &s;ecurity to property, which ever attends freedom, has a tendency to increa&s;e the &s;tock of the free community. Mo&s;t may be taken where mo&s;t is accumulated. And what is the &s;oil or climate where experience has not uniformly proved, that the voluntary flow of heaped-up plenty, bur&s;ting from the weight of its own rich luxuriance, has ever run with a more copious &s;tream of revenue, than could be &s;queezed from the dry hu&s;ks of oppre&s;&s;ed indigence, by the &s;training of all the politick machinery in the world.</P>
<P>Next we know, that parties mu&s;t ever exi&s;t in a free country. We know too, that the emulations of &s;uch parties, their contra|dictions, their reciprocal nece&s;&s;ities, their hopes, and their fears, mu&s;t &s;end them all in their turns to him that holds the balance of the &s;tate. The parties are the Game&s;ters; but Government keeps the table, and is &s;ure to be the winner in the end. When this game is played, I really think it is more to be feared, that the people will be exhau&s;ted, than that Government will not be &s;upplied. Whereas, whatever is got by acts of ab&s;olute power ill obeyed, becau&s;e odious, or by contracts ill kept, becau&s;e con&s;trained; will be narrow, feeble, uncertain, and precarious. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Ea&s;e would retract vows made in pain, as violent and void.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>I, for one, prote&s;t again&s;t compounding our demands: I declare again&s;t compounding, for a poor limited &s;um, the immen&s;e, ever|growing, eternal Debt, which is due to generous Government from protected Freedom. And &s;o may I &s;peed in the great object I pro|po&s;e to you, as I think it would not only be an act of inju&s;tice, but would be the wor&s;t oeconomy in the world, to compel the Co|lonies to a &s;um certain, either in the way of ran&s;om, or in the way of compul&s;ory compact.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="63">
But to clear up my ideas on this &s;ubject&mdash;a revenue from America tran&s;mitted hither&mdash;do not delude your&s;elves&mdash;you never can re|ceive it&mdash;No, not a &s;hilling. We have experience that from re|mote countries it is not to be expected. If, when you attempted to extract revenue from Bengal, you were obliged to return in loan what you had taken in impo&s;ition; what can you expect from North America? for certainly, if ever there was a country qualified to pro|duce wealth, it is India; or an in&s;titution fit for the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion, it is the Ea&s;t-India company. America has none of the&s;e aptitudes. If America gives you taxable objects, on which you lay your duties here, and gives you, at the &s;ame time, a &s;urplus by a foreign &s;ale of her commodities to pay the duties on the&s;e objects which you tax at home, &s;he has performed her part to the Briti&s;h revenue. But with regard to her own internal e&s;tabli&s;hments; &s;he may, I doubt not &s;he will, contribute in moderation. I &s;ay in moderation; for &s;he ought not to be permitted to exhau&s;t her&s;elf. She ought to be re&s;erved to a war; the weight of which, with the enemies that we are mo&s;t likely to have, mu&s;t be con&s;iderable in her quarter of the globe. There &s;he may &s;erve you, and &s;erve you e&s;&s;entially.</P>
<P>For that &s;ervice, for all &s;ervice, whether of revenue, trade, or empire, my tru&s;t is in her intere&s;t in the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. My hold of the Colonies is in the clo&s;e affection which grows from com|mon names, from kindred blood, from &s;imilar privileges, and equal protection. The&s;e are ties, which, though light as air, are as &s;trong as links of iron. Let the Colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights a&s;&s;ociated with your Government;&mdash;they will cling and grapple to you; and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance. But let it be once under&s;tood, that your Government may be one thing, and their Privileges another; that the&s;e two things may exi&s;t without any mutual relation; the cement is gone; the cohe&s;ion is loo&s;ened; and every thing ha&s;tens to decay and di&s;&s;olution. As long as you have the wi&s;dom to keep the &s;overeign authority of this country as the &s;anctuary of liberty, the &s;acred temple con&s;ecrated to our common faith, wherever the cho&s;en race and &s;ons of England wor&s;hip freedom, they will turn their faces towards you. The more they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more ardently they love liberty, the more perfect
<PB N="61" REF="64">
will be their obedience. Slavery they can have any where. It is a weed that grows in every &s;oil. They may have it from Spain, they may have it from Pru&s;&s;ia. But until you become lo&s;t to all feeling of your true intere&s;t and your natural dignity, freedom they can have from none but you. This is the commodity of price, of which you have the monopoly. This is the true act of navigation, which binds to you the commerce of the Colonies, and through them &s;ecures to you the wealth of the world. Deny them this par|ticipation of freedom, and you break that &s;ole bond, which origi|nally made, and mu&s;t &s;till pre&s;erve, the unity of the empire. Do not entertain &s;o weak an imagination, as that your regi&s;ters and your bonds, your affidavits and your &s;ufferances, your cockets and your clearances, are what form the great &s;ecurities of your commerce. Do not dream that your letters of office, and your in|&s;tructions, and your &s;u&s;pending clau&s;es, are the things that hold toge|ther the great contexture of this my&s;terious whole. The&s;e things do not make your government. Dead in&s;truments, pa&s;&s;ive tools as they are, it is the &s;pirit of Engli&s;h communion that gives all their life and efficacy to them. It is the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution, which, infu&s;ed through the mighty ma&s;s, pervades, feeds, unites, invigorates, vivifies, every part of the empire, even down to the minute&s;t member.</P>
<P>Is it not the &s;ame virtue which does every thing for us here in England? Do you imagine then, that it is the land tax act which rai&s;es your revenue? that it is the annual vote in the committee of &s;upply, which gives you your army? or that it is the Mutiny Bill which in&s;pires it with bravery and di&s;cipline? No! &s;urely no! It is the love of the people; it is their attachment to their government from the &s;en&s;e of the deep &s;take they have in &s;uch a glorious in|&s;titution, which gives you your army and your navy, and infu&s;es into both that liberal obedience, without which your army would be a ba&s;e rabble, and your navy nothing but rotten timber.</P>
<P>All this, I know well enough, will &s;ound wild and chimerical to the profane herd of tho&s;e vulgar and mechanical politicians, who have no place among us; a &s;ort of people who think that nothing exi&s;ts but what is gro&s;s and material; and who therefore, far from being qualified to be directors of the great movement of
<PB N="62" REF="65">
empire, are not fit to turn a wheel in the machine. But to men truly initiated and rightly taught, the&s;e ruling and ma&s;ter princi|ples, which, in the opinion of &s;uch men as I have mentioned, have no &s;ub&s;tantial exi&s;tence, are in truth every thing, and all in all. Magnanimity in politicks is not &s;eldom the true&s;t wi&s;dom; and a great empire and little minds go ill together. If we are con&s;cious of our &s;ituation, and glow with zeal to fill our place as becomes our &s;tation and our&s;elves, we ought to au&s;picate all our public pro|ceedings on America, with the old warning of the church, <HI>Sur&s;um corda!</HI> We ought to elevate our minds to the greatne&s;s of that tru&s;t to which the order of Providence has called us. By advert|ing to the dignity of this high calling, our ance&s;tors have turned a &s;avage wilderne&s;s into a glorious empire; and have made the mo&s;t exten&s;ive, and the only honourable conque&s;ts; not by de&s;troying, but by promoting, the wealth, the number, the happine&s;s, of the human race. Let us get an American revenue as we have got an American empire. Engli&s;h privileges have made it all that it is; Engli&s;h privileges alone will make it all it can be.
