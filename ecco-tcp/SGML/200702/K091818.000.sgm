<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE you will be &s;o ju&s;t unto me, as not to think I gave over writing unto you during the &s;it|ting of the Parliament, becau&s;e I did not in a good while receive an an|&s;wer unto my fir&s;t letter. I &s;eldom &s;tand upon &s;uch ceremonies, and ne|ver with tho&s;e who have obliged me, as you have done. The truth is, &s;ome of your friends, and mine, were &s;o entangled in bu&s;ine&s;s then upon the
<PB N="8" REF="4">
&s;tage, that I could &s;ay nothing to the purpo&s;e, without mentioning them; and the parts they had taken upon them&s;elves, were &s;uch as I was unwil|ling to relate. The re&s;ult of all this is, that the Lord Sunderland is out of his place and the Council: The Lord Conway &s;ucceeds him, and hath the Seals. E&s;&s;ex is al&s;o put out of the Council and Lieutenancy of Hartford|&s;hire, upon pre&s;enting a Petition from the Lords. Godolphin hoped to have had the Honour of accompanying them in their di&s;grace; but Temple only hath it. The Council being hereby weakened, is reinforced by the admi&s;|&s;ion of the Earls of Oxford, Che&s;ter|field and Ayle&s;bury; and it is hoped that, to render it compleat, the Lords Berkeley, Craven and Arundel of Tre|rice,
<PB N="9" REF="5">
&s;hall be called. The Lord Hal|lifax is gone to ruminate upon the&s;e matters at Rufford, and &s;ays he will not return &s;outhward, until the Par|liament meet at Oxford. The fruits expected from the la&s;t Parliament hav|ing been lo&s;t by little underhand bar|gains, and, as &s;ome &s;ay, the King and Parliament equally betrayed by tho&s;e that were tru&s;ted by them, men's minds &s;eem to be filled with various conceits, and many jealou&s;ies. Some think, the Writs for calling the Parliament are in them&s;elves void, as being without advice of Council; and that the Law takes notice of nothing done by the King, <HI>&s;ine &s;apientum &amp; magnatum con&s;ilio:</HI> Or that if it &s;hould meet at Oxford, its Acts would be void, or &s;ub|ject to be vacated for want of the free|dom
<PB N="10" REF="6">
of voting, which is e&s;&s;ential unto it. Others &s;ay, the validity of the Writs depends &s;olely upon the <HI>per&s;on</HI> of the King, and that others ought to think them&s;elves &s;afe, where he is &s;afe, though their danger be from him. I know not what this will produce, but I never &s;aw men's minds more heated than at pre&s;ent; and cannot think that portends le&s;s evil than the <HI>Comet.</HI> People are every where bu&s;y in choo&s;|ing Parliament Men of their own Prin|ciples, and they will probably be like unto the la&s;t; but it is thought, many Officers will be prevailed with to make <HI>fal&s;e returns.</HI> I hear of no Election pa&s;&s;ed, but that of <HI>Amer&s;ham:</HI> Of tho&s;e who by the la&s;t Parliament were there judged capable of giving their voices, Sir Robert Hill had forty; Mr.
<PB N="11" REF="7">
Sydney &s;even and thirty; Sir Jo&s;eph Drake twenty eight; Mr. Cheyney twenty nine; but the Con&s;tables have been plea&s;ed to return the two latter. To-morrow is appointed for the Elec|tion of the <HI>City-Members,</HI> who, people believe, will be the &s;ame as formerly. Some think his Royal Highne&s;s hath bu&s;ine&s;s enough to employ his thoughts: Others &s;ay he is at &s;uch perfect lei&s;ure, that the Maid of Honour, who accom|panied him, cannot employ all his &s;pare time; and for that rea&s;on, or to give her time to lay a&s;ide &s;omething that troubled her, he applys him&s;elf to a young Gentlewoman, who with much re&s;pect, and gratitude, receives the honour he is plea&s;ed to do her; but &s;he hath an old crabbed Hu&s;band, who doth not take that for a ju&s;t recom|pence
<PB N="12" REF="8">
of the great re&s;pect he hath &s;hewed unto his Royal Highne&s;s, and is not like to learn better manners from his Pre&s;byterian Bretheren.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding what is &s;aid, we good Subjects hope all will go perfect|ly well. His Maje&s;ty, as is &s;aid, re|&s;olves &s;o to reform his Court, that all &s;hall be of one Mind. Mr. Seymour being now looked upon as the greate&s;t man, brings his two friends Conway and Ranelagh into the management of bu&s;ine&s;s; and the fir&s;t of the&s;e be|ing as eminent for fine&s;&s;e of Wit, quickne&s;s and ea&s;ine&s;s in &s;tate affairs, as the other in the excellency of all moral Virtues, things cannot but go well; and we particularly hope that England will keep up its reputation
<PB N="13" REF="9">
of being, as the Cardinal Pallavicini &s;ays, the <HI>Mother</HI> and <HI>Nur&s;e of the be&s;t Wits in the World,</HI> when all foreign Mini&s;ters &s;hall come to treat with Jen|kins and Conway, who will be taken for patterns of the Genius of the Na|tion, and not thought the only men it produceth, that de&s;erve the highe&s;t prai&s;es; and le&s;t any thing &s;hould be wanting, Mr. Hide is joined unto the&s;e. It is true that we have not of our Na+tion, a man to put at the head of the Soldiers, as admirable in military &s;kill, and virtues, as tho&s;e above-mentioned are in civils and morals: But the knowledge of our own defects, the &s;a|gacity of di&s;covering in the Earl of Fever&s;ham the qualities which we have not, and the prudent humility of &s;ub|mitting unto him that is ble&s;&s;ed with
<PB N="14" REF="10">
them, though a &s;tranger, de&s;erves &s;ome commendations: And I am confident, that when things &s;hall be brought into &s;uch order, that a Papi&s;t may appear open-faced, we &s;hall &s;hew as great re|&s;pect unto the Lord Dunbarton. France and Germany, that are full of their Trophies, cannot but admire this, whil&s;t we re&s;t &s;ecure under their &s;hadow. Fit men may more ea&s;ily be found for le&s;s eminent Places; and the Earl of Thanet, as is &s;aid, &s;hall &s;ucceed Mr. Ru&s;&s;ell in the Command of the Foot Guards. Civil and military affairs being thus &s;ettled, Trea&s;ures flowing in unto us on all &s;ides, and all Foreign Princes, concerned in our affairs, be|ing &s;ure unto us; we need not fear a few <HI>di&s;contented Lords,</HI> a <HI>mutinous Ci|ty,</HI> or <HI>murmuring Counties;</HI> and
<PB N="15" REF="11">
pre&s;uming that the va&s;t magazines of arms made at Bre&s;t, and &s;ome that with a good quantity of ammunition, were lately &s;ent into Ireland, are in pur|&s;uance of agreements made with you, we cannot but think all will tend to our good.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE you will excu&s;e the trou|ble I give you, in enclo&s;ing this, and de&s;ire you to &s;end it forward into Ga&s;coiney. It is a climate where I cannot be &s;u&s;pected of &s;ending any thing of a dangerous nature; but we have &s;o many at the Po&s;t-Hou&s;e, in|fected with the mo&s;t impertinent folly, that a Pacquet though directed thither can hardly pa&s;s unvi&s;ited, unle&s;s the Per&s;on to whom it is directed do pro|tect it.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Re&s;olutions of the City, have been as plea&s;ing to the Countie
<PB N="17" REF="13">
as di&s;ta&s;tful to the Court. Ye&s;terday the Company of Artillery intended to have cho&s;en Prince Rupert to be their Captain, and Sir Thomas Player their Leader; but a letter was produced from the King, rather de&s;iring than com|manding that no new Officers &s;hould be cho&s;en; and they having no Con&s;titu|tion beyond an Act of King and Coun|cil, depending upon his Maje&s;ty's Will, did unwillingly obey.</P>
<P>Parliament-Men are for the mo&s;t part cho&s;en by the Parties mo&s;t contra|ry to the Court, and many believe this next Hou&s;e of Commons will not be at all more pliable than the la&s;t. Sir Wil|liam Waller and Poultney were this day cho&s;en at We&s;tmin&s;ter without any oppo&s;ition. Col. Titus and Sir Tho|mas
<PB N="18" REF="14">
Proby were with the &s;ame facility cho&s;en Knights of Huntington&s;hire; Hambden the elder, and Wharton, of Buckingham&s;hire; with a multitude of others.</P>
<P>The Lady Port&s;mouth is &s;aid to have entirely recovered her lo&s;t favour. The Earl of Sunderland is at his Hou&s;e in Queen-Street. The Lady Hallifax, on Tue&s;day, followed her Lord to Ruf|ford.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEING con&s;cious unto my &s;elf, that what I could &s;ay of bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;es now upon the Stage would be of little u&s;e unto you, I thought it fit|ter for me to be one of the la&s;t in writing to you, than to take place ac|cording to my de&s;ire of &s;erving you, which would &s;uffer me to yield to none; but le&s;t this acknowledgment &s;hould be taken for a pretence to cover lazine&s;s, I will here give you &s;uch a &s;ight of things&punc; as I have; and intend to continue to do the like as often as I can without troubling you. You will
<PB N="20" REF="16">
have heard from all hands, what tem|per the Hou&s;e of Commons appears to be of, and that the Earl of Danby hath accompli&s;hed his promi&s;e of bringing it into an entire &s;ubjection unto the King's Will, as well as the other two points, of paying his Maje&s;ty's Debts, encrea&s;ing his Trea&s;ure, and rendering him con&s;iderable among&s;t his Neigh|bouring Princes; which are verified in leaving twenty two Shillings and ten pence in the Exchequer, two and forty hundred thou&s;and Pounds of pa&s;&s;ive debts, and the revenue anticipated for almo&s;t a Year and half, and the account his Lord&s;hip was plea&s;ed to give in his &s;peech to the Peers, of the e&s;teem the King of France had for his per&s;on and government. Notwith&s;tanding all this, he is &s;o far con&s;idered at Court, that
<PB N="21" REF="17">
his concernments are a general ob|&s;truction to all bu&s;ine&s;&s;es. The Lord Berckely, Fr&eacute;cheville, and others of the learned, think he hath behaved him&s;elf &s;o well, as to de&s;erve no puni&s;h|ment, and therefore oppo&s;ed the Com|mitment of the Bill of Attainder, that it might be ca&s;t out: Shaft&s;bury, E&s;|&s;ex and Halifax differing &s;omething in opinion from them, in compliance unto the King's de&s;ires, did, as an amend|ment, wipe out the word <HI>Attainder,</HI> and made it almo&s;t the &s;ame with that which their Lord&s;hips had formerly &s;ent up to bani&s;h him, and declaring him attainted only if he came into England after the fir&s;t of May next: The con&s;ideration of which bu&s;ine&s;s, is likely this day to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Hou&s;e of Commons, and if their mind be
<PB N="22" REF="18">
known before this letter be &s;ealed, it &s;hall be in&s;erted.</P>
<P>The next important point likely to be pur&s;ued is, to pro&s;ecute the la&s;t week's Vote, that <HI>all the Forces now on foot in</HI> England, <HI>except the trained Bands, were kept up contrary to Law;</HI> and though it was objected that the King's Guards, and the Garri&s;ons of Port&s;mouth and other places would be included; it was an&s;wered, that <HI>Kings governing ju&s;tly according to</HI> Law, <HI>had no need of</HI> Cu&s;todia Corporis; and that it was better to have no Garri&s;ons at all, than &s;uch as were commanded by Leg, Holmes, and their Peers.</P>
<P>The controver&s;y concerning the E|lection at Grin&s;tead, was determined
<PB N="23" REF="19">
at the Committee in favour of Mr. Pow|ell, cho&s;en by the Commons, and Tho|mas Pelham, by the major part of the Corporation, no complaint being made again&s;t him. Powell choo&s;ing to &s;tand as he is cho&s;en for Ciciter, the di&s;pute upon the new Election is like to be be|tween Skrog and Sir Thomas Littleton, who is like to have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Dor&s;et Family, the Pelhams, and &s;ome others. On Friday la&s;t, the &s;ame Committee voted the Right of Election at Wind&s;or to be in the Commons; and that <HI>Ernely</HI> and his Companion hav|ing been unduly cho&s;en by the Cor|poration, a new Election &s;hould be made; but the Hou&s;e approving of the fir&s;t part only, annulled the Election of Ernely and the other, and approved that of Winhood and Storkey.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="20">
All <HI>Foreign Affairs</HI> are at a &s;tand, only Van Beuninghen takes great pains to make people believe the King of France intends to add England unto his other Conque&s;ts, and di&s;abu&s;e &s;uch as were &s;o fooli&s;h as to believe there was any thing of truth in the reports of tho&s;e that had &s;poken of the Popi&s;h Plot; and finding me infected with the &s;ame opinion, with &s;ome of my Friends, he was plea&s;ed to &s;pend two hours the other day in the Park to con|vince me of my error, in which he did &s;ucceed as well as he u&s;ed to do in his great de&s;igns.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> certainly inclines not to be &s;o &s;tiff as formerly in advancing on|ly tho&s;e that exalt <HI>Prerogative;</HI> but the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, and &s;ome others that
<PB N="25" REF="21">
are coming into play thereupon, can|not avoid being &s;u&s;pected of having in|tentions different from what they have hitherto profe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Earl of Ormond's mi&s;carriages are &s;o extreme, and his favour to the Iri&s;h &s;o apparent, that few believe he can continue in the Government of Ire|land. Some &s;peak of three Ju&s;tices and a good Commander of the Army, whol|ly fixed upon an Engli&s;h Intere&s;t; but if a Lieutenant be &s;ent, I believe it will be E&s;&s;ex or Halifax.</P>
<P>That you may &s;ee the good humour we are in, I here enclo&s;ed &s;end you, a piece of Poetry given unto me by a Friend of yours; and if you have not &s;een another, which is the Speech of
<PB N="26" REF="22">
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Writ by Andrew Marvel.</NOTE> <HI>Hodge</HI> the <HI>Clown</HI> from the top of the <HI>Pyramid,</HI> I will endeavour to &s;end it unto you.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons have this day pre&s;ented unto the Lords, the Ar|ticles drawn again&s;t the five Lords in the Tower. I al&s;o hear ju&s;t now, that they do adhere to the Bill of Attainder of the Earl of Danby, and will no ways admit of the Lords amendments of it. One <HI>Reading,</HI> a Lawyer, not long &s;ince offered four thou&s;and pounds, and three hundred pounds a year in Land to <HI>Bedloe,</HI> if he would di&s;avow the te&s;timony he had given again&s;t the Lords of Powys, Bella&s;&s;ys and Peters; which being communicated unto Prince
<PB N="27" REF="23">
Robert, and Earl of E&s;&s;ex, he brought Reading by their advice into a place, where two Witne&s;&s;es heard him; whereupon Reading was apprehended, and he having found means whil&s;t he was in the Serjeant's hands to &s;end a Letter to his Wife, to be delivered to Mr. Chyvins, (de&s;iring to be admitted to the King's Pre&s;ence, promi&s;ing to tell great matters) his Maje&s;ty refers him wholly to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and offers to i&s;&s;ue out a Commi&s;&s;ion of Oyer and Terminer for his Trial, which will be very &s;peedy, if he &s;ave not him&s;elf by di&s;coveries: This Morning a Letter was intercepted written to him by his Wife, where|in &s;he tells him, that every body &s;ays he is a Rogue, and if he doth

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are &s;o much afore-hand in obliging me, when I mo&s;t want|ed a friend, that I cannot hope in a long time to pay my debt, though I were in a place that gave me more advantages, than any I can ever rea|&s;onably expect; but you may ever be &s;ure of all that is within my reach. I write now in &s;ome ha&s;te, but am un|willing this Po&s;t &s;hould go without a Letter from me. I pre&s;ume you know that the Earl of Danby rendered him|&s;elf to the Black Rod, on Wedne&s;day la&s;t; and that de&s;iring of the Lords at
<PB N="30" REF="26">
the Bar, that for his health he might be &s;uffer'd to continue under his Cu&s;|tody: That he might have recour&s;e, as often as occa&s;ion &s;hould require, to all State Papers, that were nece&s;&s;ary to him in making his defence: That he might at once have a Copy of all his Charge, and be obliged not to an&s;wer to any part, until the whole were be|fore him: And that he might have Serjeant We&s;ton, Serjeant Raymond, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Holt a&s;&s;igned un|to him for Coun&s;el. He received no other an&s;wer, than that if he told what Papers he de&s;ired, the Hou&s;e would do as was u&s;ual in tho&s;e ca&s;es: That the Hou&s;e of Commons could not be abridged of the liberty retained to it|&s;elf, of bringing in additional charges, if it were thought fit: That he might
<PB N="31" REF="27">
have for his Coun&s;el, &s;uch of tho&s;e he had named as were not of the King's: And that he mu&s;t be committed to the Tower, where Cheeke received him. Subtle men find great my&s;teries in his rendering him&s;elf, and make the King to be of the Plot; but tho&s;e that &s;ee no farther than I, believe he hath had in this, and all his bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of late, no other Coun&s;el than his Lady.</P>
<P>You will perhaps be &s;urpriz'd to hear, that ye&s;terday the King did en|tirely di&s;&s;olve his Old Privy Council, and cho&s;e a new one, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen Officers of the Crown, ten Lords, and five Commoners; his Ma|je&s;ty retaining unto him&s;elf the liberty of naming a Pre&s;ident, calling &s;uch Princes of the Blood, as &s;hould be
<PB N="32" REF="28">
from time to time; and the Secretary of Scotland for the time being, if he thought fit; declaring moreover, that when&s;oever any Place &s;hould be va|cant, he would name none without the advice of the Council; and that the Per&s;on named &s;hould be called by a Letter &s;ub&s;cribed by them all. To which he was plea&s;ed to add, That he would have no <HI>fir&s;t</HI> or <HI>principal Mi|ni&s;ter,</HI> no Committee of Foreign af|fairs, or Cabinet Council; but that in all things he would follow and rely upon their advice, next unto that of his Great Council, the Parliament, which was al&s;o &s;pecified in the letter &s;ent by his Maje&s;ty for the calling of every one of them, who are now to &s;erve in Council. The Officers, who by their places are to be of the Coun|cil
<PB N="33" REF="29" MS="y">
(as I remember) are the Chan|cellor, Chief Ju&s;tice, Privy Seal, Or|mond Steward, Arlington Chamber|lain, Su&s;&s;ex, as fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury, Sir Henry Capell as fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Admiralty, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and Bi|&s;hop of London, the two Secretaries, and &s;ome others that I have for|got; but Newport and Mainard are none. The Lords are, the Dukes of Newca&s;tle and Albemarle, the Marque&s;&s;es of Winche&s;ter and Wor|ce&s;ter, Earls of Bridgewater and Sali&s;|bury, Vi&s;counts Faulconbridge and Halifax, Barons Roberts and Hollys; Commoners are, the Lords Ru&s;&s;el and Cavendi&s;h, Mr. Powell, Mr. Seymour, and (as I hear) Sir William Temple.
<PB N="34" REF="30" MS="y">
I hear al&s;o &s;even Commi&s;&s;ioners nam'd for the Admiralty, Sir Henry Capell, Merres, Littleton, Vaughan, Mr. Da|niel Finch, and two others, that I have forgotten. The Lord Shaft&s;bury is declared Pre&s;ident of the Council. The&s;e were &s;worn this morning, and that Ceremony being performed, the King went to the hou&s;e of Lords, and &s;ent for the hou&s;e of Commons, to whom he did impart all that had pa&s;&s;ed; and all that I have yet &s;pok|en with, &s;eem much plea&s;ed; though it might have been wi&s;hed, that &s;ome of tho&s;e that are cho&s;en had been left out. A friend <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Marque&s;s of Halifax, Earls of Sunderland and E&s;&s;ex.

well agree among&s;t them&s;elves, I be|lieve they will have the management of almo&s;t all bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, and may bring much honour to them&s;elves, and good to our nation.</P>
<P>I find men's hearts much &s;et upon taking the Government of Ireland out of the Earl of Ormond's hands. If a Lieutenant be named, I believe it will be E&s;&s;ex or Halifax; and, if neither of them, three Ju&s;tices.</P>
<P>Others de&s;ign Halifax &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his unkle Coventry. You will perhaps wonder, not to hear his brother Wil|liam mentioned; but as yet there is no occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>We have every day fooli&s;h alarms

from the French Fleet, and I find no body but the Lord Sunderland and my&s;elf that believe not one word of it. Morgan, Governor of Jer&s;ey, is dead, and Laheer appointed to &s;ucceed him. That our affairs may be managed by as able a man abroad as that i&s;land is defended by, Sir H. Goodrike expects in a few days to be di&s;patched for Spain.

<P>The five Popi&s;h Lords in the Tow|er, had at the fir&s;t given in cavilling
<PB N="39" REF="35">
uncertain an&s;wers; but Bella&s;&s;ys and Peters on Thur&s;day, and Powys, Staf|ford and Arundell on Saturday, with|out any ambiguity, pleaded <HI>not guilty,</HI> and declared they put them&s;elves upon the Lords Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The Earl of Danby hath not thought fit, as yet, to deal &s;o clearly, but hath put in a huge long an&s;wer, containing great prote&s;tations of his own Inno|cence, as to every part of his charge; and then pleads his pardon, which enu|merates and acquits him of all the crimes, that it is almo&s;t po&s;&s;ible for a man to commit. This is by &s;ome thought very &s;trange; his Innocence that he prote&s;ts, declaring that he had no need of Pardon, and the Pardon pleaded in effect acknowledging the
<PB N="40" REF="36">
truth of his Charge; it being u&s;ele&s;s if he be not guilty. Hereupon other que&s;tions do ari&s;e, as whether the King can pardon? Whether if he have this power, he hath rightly executed it, the formalities not having been ob&s;erved? And la&s;tly, whether he will in&s;i&s;t upon this an&s;wer, which will not leave him any plea at all, if the pardon be judg|ed defective? I dare give no opinion upon the&s;e points, but I hear the learn|ed &s;ay, <HI>the</HI> King <HI>cannot pardon a man impeached by Parliament upon a pub|lick account:</HI> That though he could, this would be of no value, being de|fective in all the formalities: And though perhaps the Court may be pre|valent enough in the hou&s;e of Lords, to have it admitted; that would be of evil con&s;equence, no man doubting but
<PB N="41" REF="37">
the hou&s;e of Commons will extremely di&s;like &s;uch a Judgment, and grow very refractory thereupon; and the whole Nation would follow them in it, &s;o as all bu&s;ine&s;s would be thereby ob|&s;tructed; by which means the King, upon the per&s;onal account of the Earl of Danby, would lo&s;e the advantage of all that hath been done of late to plea&s;e the Nation; which I leave to your Judgment, that know the Court much better than I do. This point I only find to be clear, that if the Pardon can be found good, though the formalities are wanting, it will be made good; and the burthen left upon the Chancel|lor, that put the great Seal unto it, without taking care of &s;eeing them ob|&s;erved.</P>

Some Judges were ye&s;terday put out; Wild for inability of body, and Barton and Thurland of mind, with &s;ome others; to whom old Ellys, Ray|mond and Pemmerton, Leake and At|kins the younger are to &s;ucceed. The hou&s;e of Lords is bu&s;y upon one Bill concerning Popery, and the hou&s;e of Commons upon another, both inclin|ing to find a way of di&s;tingui&s;hing Pro|te&s;tants only from Papi&s;ts, but cannot yet re&s;olve upon it, &s;o as to include the &s;everal di&s;&s;enting Sects; that Papi&s;ts may not be &s;heltered, and receive the indulgence (which is not intended them) under other Names; and this difficulty is chiefly occa&s;ioned by the Quakers, who, for more than one rea|&s;on, are thought lea&s;t to de&s;erve much to be cared for. Shaft&s;bury and Ha|lifax

con&s;ider of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown in relation to Popery, upon the debate of which Secretary Coventry, among&s;t other things, is &s;aid to have reproach|ed Birch, that his di&s;cour&s;es &s;avoured of the Years 1640 and 41, but that him&s;elf continued in the &s;ame mind he had ever been; and having taken the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy to the King and his Succe&s;&s;ors, could not without Perjury fail of performing the contents of them to his Succe&s;&s;or, what Religion &s;oever he &s;hould hap|pen to be of. Unto which Birch re|plied, a&s;&s;erting his own &s;ervices to the King; taxing Coventry of having broken his word to the Parliament twice the la&s;t year, in relation to a War promi&s;ed to be declared and ac|tually made upon France; di&s;&s;erved
<PB N="45" REF="41">
the King and Nation, in having been a principal cau&s;e of breaking the triple League; and concluded, he was as fit to be turn'd out of the Council as any one that had been &s;o. Bennet not long before had &s;aid, that though this Council &s;eemed in &s;ome degree to be reformed, no good could rea&s;on|ably be expected, as long as one conti|nued in it, who did by &s;uch violences and other undue ways advance Arbi|trary Power in Scotland, and one that had ma&s;&s;es daily &s;aid for him in Ire|land: For the fir&s;t of the&s;e he named Latherdale, and left the hou&s;e in an opinion, that for the other he meant Angle&s;ey. At the la&s;t it was conclud|ed, that the King &s;hould be de&s;ired to give order for the execution of Picker|ing and another condemned Prie&s;t;
<PB N="46" REF="42">
that a Proclamation &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued to bani&s;h all Papi&s;ts without any other exceptions than publick Mini&s;ters, and their followers, twenty miles out of London: The Lady Port&s;mouth was named, but not pur&s;ued: That the Duke of York being a Papi&s;t, the hopes of his &s;ucceeding unto the Crown had been the principal ground and founda|tion of the Plot again&s;t the King's life and the Prote&s;tant Religion: That the &s;ecret Committee &s;hould, on Wed|ne&s;day next, bring into the Hou&s;e &s;uch Letters and Papers as they had in their hands relating unto the &s;aid Duke.

carry up the Me&s;&s;age. They al&s;o voted an addre&s;s to be made to the King, that all Sea-ports, places of &s;trength, and command of Ships may be put into tru&s;ty hands, and concluded to refer the farther con&s;ideration of this bu&s;i|ne&s;s to Wedne&s;day next, and I believe it will be then debated, whether &s;uch an A&s;&s;ociation &s;hall be entered into as was appointed in Queen Elizabeth's time; or an Act made, that this Par|liament &s;hould not determine in &s;uch a time as &s;hould be limited, though the King &s;hould die, or in &s;o many months after, or &s;omething to that purpo&s;e, which may tend to the King's &s;ecurity. I do not well know what the Hou&s;es have done this Morning, but hear the Me&s;&s;age from the hou&s;e of Commons is carried up to the Lords, and that

they have appointed the Earl of Dan|by to be at their Bar to-morrow morn|ing. The Commons have al&s;o per|fected their Bill for di&s;banding of the Army, by a Land-Tax of twenty thou|&s;and pounds the month, &s;ub&s;equent to that which will expire in February next. Several Prie&s;ts were taken the la&s;t night, of which two confe&s;s they were &s;ent over by all means to endea|vour to invalidate Oates and Bedloe's te&s;timony.

<P>THOUGH the la&s;t week was &s;pent rather in wrangling than the di&s;patch of any bu&s;ine&s;s of impor|tance, I continue to give you an ac|count of what I hear, becau&s;e the&s;e irregular motions are often the fore|runners of great matters; and as they denote the temper of a Nation, they give good grounds of gue&s;&s;ing what they will end in. I do not &s;end you the King and Chancellor's &s;peeches, becau&s;e I pre&s;ume care was taken to &s;end them to you by the la&s;t po&s;t; but perhaps others have not been &s;o free in
<PB N="51" REF="47">
telling you the effect of it as I &s;hall be. The Courtiers did believe, that the King's yielding that the Parlia|ment &s;hould not end with his life, or be revived by his death, if it chanced to be di&s;&s;olved in his life-time, and have the nomination of all Officers, both civil and military, if his Succe&s;&s;or proved to be a Papi&s;t, would have given entire &s;atisfaction unto the hou&s;e of Commons. But to the contrary it is certain, that the &s;uppo&s;ition that the next in blood mu&s;t be King, though a Papi&s;t, is &s;o di&s;ta&s;tful to them, that no|thing will plea&s;e upon that odious con|dition; and as to this particular, it is looked upon as a trick to bring the Parliament to confe&s;s and confirm the Duke's title, that is, a little gilding to cover a poi&s;onous pill. This puts them
<PB N="52" REF="48">
upon various coun&s;els; &s;ome would <HI>impeach</HI> him, upon what is di&s;covered of his part in the Plot: Others incline more to bring in an Act, to <HI>exclude</HI> him from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown, as being a Papi&s;t, and thereby a friend unto and dependent upon, a foreign and enemy Power. Some of tho&s;e that are of this mind, look <Q><HI>who is fitte&s;t to &s;ucceed,</HI> if this &s;hould be; and they are for the mo&s;t part <HI>divided between</HI> the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Orange</HI> and <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> hath plainly the mo&s;t <HI>plau&s;ible title,</HI> by his <HI>Mother</HI> and his Wife; but, be|&s;ides the opinion of the influence it is believed the Duke of York would have over him, it is feared that the <HI>Commonwealth-party</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> would be &s;o frighted with that, as to
<PB N="53" REF="49">
ca&s;t it&s;elf ab&s;olutely into the hands of the <HI>King of France,</HI> who might thereby have a fair occa&s;ion of ruining both England and Holland.</Q> I need not tell you the rea&s;ons <HI>again&s;t</HI> Mon|mouth; but the &s;tronge&s;t I hear alledg|ed <HI>for</HI> him, are, that who&s;oever is op|po&s;ed to York, will have a good party, and all Scotland, which is every day like to be in arms, doth certainly fa|vour him, <Q>and may probably be of as much importance in the troubles that are now likely to fall upon us, as they were in the beginning of the la&s;t.</Q> Others are only upon nega|tives. But when I have &s;aid what I can upon this bu&s;ine&s;s, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I do not know three men of a mind, and that a &s;pirit of giddine&s;s reigns among&s;t

us, far beyond any I have ever ob&s;erved in my life.</P>
<P>Nothing was done the la&s;t week con|cerning the Popi&s;h Lords in the Tower. The Earl of Danby on Saturday la&s;t did in&s;i&s;t upon his former plea and an|&s;wer, how little &s;en&s;e &s;oever there be in it. &s;ome &s;ay it is, <HI>ex indu&s;tria per|plexa;</HI> and that having the Court and hou&s;e of Lords to favour him, he cares not for the incon&s;i&s;tence of prote&s;ting his innocence, which renders his par|don u&s;ele&s;s, and pleading his pardon, which is a confe&s;&s;ion of guilt; hoping that if the Commons do demur in Law upon the two points, (fir&s;t, that the King cannot pardon a Delinquent im|peached by one Commoner, much le&s;s by all the Commons in England;
<PB N="55" REF="51">
&s;econdly, that though it were granted he might pardon, this pardon could not hold, becau&s;e it wants all the for|malities) the Lords would over-rule it, and then he is acquitted.</P>
<P>The Bill for the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> was pa&s;&s;ed by the Lords on Friday la&s;t, and &s;ent down to the Commons. The &s;ame day they al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed an Act for the ba|ni&s;hing of the Papi&s;ts out of London, and penned it &s;o well by the indu&s;try of the Bi&s;hops, that if the Commons &s;hould pa&s;s it without amendment, all the Non-conformi&s;ts of London would be driven out of town, and half the &s;hops &s;hut up. The Bill for di&s;band|ing the Army is pa&s;&s;ed the two Hou&s;es, and I pre&s;ume will not &s;tay long for the Royal a&s;&s;ent. The Lords did a&s;|&s;ent
<PB N="56" REF="52">
to the vote of the Commons, that the Duke being a Papi&s;t, had been the occa&s;ion of the Plot, but added the word, <HI>unwillingly.</HI> The whole bu&s;i|ne&s;s formerly mentioned of the Earl of Danby his endeavour to &s;uborn Bedloe to renounce his te&s;timony, was the la&s;t week verified before a Committee of Lords, and Dumblain his man con|fe&s;&s;ed he had been employed to do it; &s;o as his Lord&s;hip is found to have done ju&s;t the &s;ame thing, for which <HI>Reading</HI> &s;tood the la&s;t week in the pil|lory. Some Scholars &s;ent from St. O|mer's were lately apprehended by Sir William Waller, and confe&s;s they are &s;ent hither by the Je&s;uits, by any means to invalidate Oates and Bedloe's te&s;ti|monies, but they rather confirm them. The Lord Ro&s;s having been put
<PB N="57" REF="53">
out of the hou&s;e of Commons, is by Writ called to the hou&s;e of Lords. Sir John Hartup, who petitioned again&s;t him, is, upon the invalidating of his Election, cho&s;en by the Freeholders of the County, and took his place in the Hou&s;e on Friday. This day is ap|pointed for the new Election in Nor|folk, and it is thought Sir John Hub|bert will have the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir, I de&s;ire you to tell Mon&s;ieur de Ruvygny the younger, that upon his recommendation I did addre&s;s the Duke de Gramont's <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to the places where all the be&s;t hor&s;es in England were to be had; but he has rid four hundred miles, and is returned with|out liking any. To &s;ay the truth, he is &s;uch a proud a&s;s, that he neither
<PB N="58" REF="54">
knows what is good, nor will believe any body el&s;e. I had directed him to &s;ee two, that are &s;aid to be as fine young hor&s;es of five years old as any are in England, which having never been trained were fat, and as he &s;aid, <HI>trop relever.</HI> Near Lincoln he &s;aw two of the Lord Ca&s;tletown's, which had the &s;ame faults. At the Lord Burlington's in York&s;hire he &s;aw one, that is thought to be worth as much as any one in England, bred of an Arabian, &s;ix years old pa&s;&s;ed, never run but once at Kippling, and then won the Plate; and being now thin, and drawn for another cour&s;e, he is to run within this week, this wi&s;e Gentleman took him for a Mazette: He did the like with &s;ome others in the &s;ame place and at the Marque&s;s of
<PB N="59" REF="55">
Winche&s;ter's; upon all which I have no more to &s;ay to Mon&s;. Ruvygny, than that he &s;hould find a way to re|vive Bucephalus, or &s;end a man that hath more wit than this, to take &s;uch as the world affords.</P>
<P>The horrible reports made from France of poi&s;oning, affright rea&s;on|able per&s;ons here, as much as the di&s;|cour&s;es of the fleet at Bre&s;t do fools.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of Commons have voted, that the pardon pretended by the Earl of Danby was of no value, and went up to de&s;ire ju&s;tice upon him of the hou&s;e of Lords. We live in a time that no man, by what is pa&s;&s;ed, can well judge what is to be expected for the future; but I am much inclined
<PB N="60" REF="56">
to believe, that Danby having in this la&s;t act followed his own di&s;po&s;ition, that ever delighted in juggling and in|directne&s;s, will, by the tricks he hath played, have found a way to hang him&s;elf. It is &s;aid, that the King will be at the Hou&s;e to-morrow, in his Robes, to pa&s;s the act for di&s;|banding the Army. This morning, Secretary Coventry not being well, the Lord Ru&s;&s;el from the King declared unto the hou&s;e of Commons, he ex|pected no &s;upply from them this &s;e&s;|&s;ions, but de&s;ired care might be taken of the Navy.</P>

The la&s;t week was &s;pent for the mo&s;t part in janglings between the two Hou&s;es, upon <HI>points of Privilege</HI> re|lating unto the Rights the Lords pre|tend unto in points of <HI>Judicatories;</HI> which the Lords Frecheville, Berckely, Ferrers, Ayle&s;bury, Northampton, and &s;ome others equal unto them in under|&s;tanding, eloquence and reputation, do with the help of the Bi&s;hops very magnanimou&s;ly defend. Several pro|po&s;als have been made by the Com|mons of conferring with them upon all the points in que&s;tion, or appointing a Committee of both Hou&s;es, which, meeting together, might adju&s;t all tho&s;e that might be occa&s;ion of difference; but their Lord&s;hips di&s;daining to con|fer upon points that as they did &s;up|po&s;e depended wholly upon their Will,
<PB N="63" REF="59">
on Friday la&s;t did vote that they would have no &s;uch Committee, which vote was carried only by two voices, the one &s;ide having 54, the other 52. Of eighteen Bi&s;hops that were pre&s;ent, &s;ix|teen were on the victorious &s;ide, and only Durham and Carli&s;le were &s;o humble as to join with the vanqui&s;hed. Of tho&s;e 52, one and fifty the next day prote&s;ted, and I think only lazi|ne&s;s hindered the Earl of Leice&s;ter, who was the other, not to prote&s;t, as well as the others with whom he had voted. On Saturday there was a con|ference between the two Hou&s;es upon this bu&s;ine&s;s, and it appearing that all proceedings would &s;top thereupon, it being impo&s;&s;ible for two to agree upon any thing, unle&s;s their thoughts and rea&s;ons are communicated, they were
<PB N="64" REF="60">
plea&s;ed ye&s;terday to recede from that vote, and appointed a Committee of twelve Lords to confer with a double number of Commons thereupon.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of Commons have made an addre&s;s unto his Maje&s;ty, de&s;iring him to remove the Duke of Latherdale out of all employments in England and Ireland, and from his pre&s;ence for ever; to which they received a dilatory an|&s;wer.</P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's hath been lately murther'd in his coach three miles from St. Andrew's, by ten men, that there &s;et upon him, of which two were taken by &s;ome hor&s;e that came &s;uddenly to the place. It is not known who they are, nor
<PB N="65" REF="61">
who employed them; but Latherdale is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to lay it upon the Nonconformi&s;ts, and hath thereupon cau&s;ed a very &s;evere Proclamation to be i&s;&s;ued out again&s;t them: But others believe it was upon a private quarrel with &s;ome Gentlemen, that by fraud and power the Prelate had thrown out of their e&s;tates, he having been mo&s;t remarkable for outragious covetou&s;ne&s;s, be&s;ides other Epi&s;copal qualities.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of Commons have for|bidden all Commoners of England to be of Coun&s;el to the Earl of Danby, under the pain of being e&s;teemed be|trayers of the rights of all the Com|mons, by whom he is accu&s;ed, unle&s;s leave be a&s;ked and given by them.

The Bill for <HI>disbanding the Army</HI> is pa&s;&s;ed. On Saturday the King hav|ing appointed &s;ixteen &s;mall pieces of Ordnance to be &s;ent to Port&s;mouth, notice was taken thereof in the hou&s;e of Commons, and a great &s;u&s;picion, that they being &s;ent with field-car|riages, harne&s;&s;es for hor&s;es, and all ne|ce&s;&s;aries belonging to the train of a marching Army, they might be in|tended rather for &s;uch an u&s;e, than to furni&s;h a Garri&s;on as is pretended. At the &s;ame time reports were &s;pread, that the Duke of York was returned into England, or hourly expected, and &s;ome believe his bu&s;ine&s;s is to hinder the di&s;|banding of the Army, with &s;uch others as the knowledge of his nature, toge|ther with the per&s;ons that command in Port&s;mouth, the I&s;le of Wight, and

&s;ome other places may &s;ugge&s;t, in the mo&s;t jealous time that I have ever liv|ed in.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of Commons &s;ate ye&s;ter|day, being Sunday, to hear &s;uch papers read, as the &s;ecret Committee thought fit to produce relating to the <HI>Duke of York,</HI> which had been found among&s;t the Cardinal of Norfolk's papers, and other places. They are many in num|ber, which &s;peak of his a&s;&s;enting unto and approving of the Plot in all points, but none directed to him, or written by him. Many various motions were made, but in the end it was ordered, that a Bill &s;hould be drawn up, to de|bar him from the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown.</HI> Sir Francis Winnington and Mr. Vau|ghan would have put off the debate,
<PB N="68" REF="64">
until the trial o&s; Danby and the Popi&s;h Lords was over. Sir William Coven|try, Sir Thomas Littleton, and others, &s;poke directly again&s;t the thing, but the major part by much was of the other opinion, &s;o as on the divi&s;ion appointed upon the que&s;tion, whether there &s;hould be Candles, the inequality was &s;o great, that the pains of telling was &s;pared, and when the main que|&s;tion was put, there was no divi&s;ion at all. Not to trouble you with many particulars, I will only recite one, which is, that a Gentleman moving the words &s;hould be put in, <Q>Or ever had been a Papi&s;t,</Q> they were laid a&s;ide, as &s;ome believe, in re&s;pect unto him, who by the direction of the late Lord Crofts, was brought up under the di&s;cipline of the Peres de l'Oratorie. The next work
<PB N="69" REF="65">
was to make an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, full of humility and loyalty, expre&s;&s;ing their utmo&s;t re&s;olution to &s;erve him with their lives and fortunes in the pre|&s;ervation of the Prote&s;tant Religion.</P>
<P>I hope the new method re&s;olved up|on here, in relation unto publick Mi|ni&s;ters, will be of as little prejudice unto you where you are, as the report of the occa&s;ion which began with you will do you here.</P>

The Bi&s;hops are the principal cau&s;es of the di&s;pute, affecting a right to &s;it as Judges, and content them&s;elves to leave the exerci&s;e of it to the Papi&s;ts, but with a prote&s;tation that the Prece|dent be not alledged again&s;t them for the future, but in&s;i&s;t upon &s;itting in
<PB N="71" REF="67">
the Earl of Danby's ca&s;e, until they come to vote upon life or death; and to &s;hew how ingenious they are in that point, they profe&s;s they do no preju|dice to their calling, in being his Judges, re&s;olving not to condemn him. The truth is, that bu&s;ine&s;s is full of a multitude of difficulties, that are very hard to decide; the chief of which are, fir&s;t, whether the King hath power to pardon one impeached by the Com|mons; &s;econdly, whether that Judg|ment belonging to the declaratory part of the Law, is to be given by one or both Hou&s;es. Thirdly, in ca&s;e the King can pardon, whether this hath the for|malities required. Fourthly, If this par|don be not good, whether he may be admitted to plead any thing el&s;e. Fifthly, If he may plead, whether the
<PB N="72" REF="68">
points he is accu&s;ed of amount to Trea|&s;on, which may probably exerci&s;e the Hou&s;e until it be di&s;&s;olved or pro|rogued. The two Hou&s;es differ al&s;o, in that the Lords would fir&s;t try the Popi&s;h Lords, and the Commons would give the preference to Danby.</P>
<P>The Duke Hamilton arrived the la&s;t week from Scotland with a great train, and was received here in triumph: All that come with him &s;ay, the Arch|bi&s;hop of St. Andrew's was killed by one that had been his own Steward, and others that were not Conventicle|men.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;evere Bill</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Duke of York</HI> was read on Thur&s;day la&s;t, and is appointed to be read again to-mor|row.
<PB N="73" REF="69">
It recites the Pope's preten&s;ions to power over Kings, particularly in England; the Immorality of the Ro|man Religion; Incompatibility of tho&s;e that profe&s;s it with Engli&s;h Pro|te&s;tants; their perpetual Plots again&s;t the Government; &s;edulity in &s;educing the Duke; and a multitude of other things of the like nature in the pream|ble: A&s;&s;erts the power of Parliament to di&s;po&s;e of the Succe&s;&s;ion, as be&s;t conduced to the good of the King|dom, which had been often exerci&s;ed in debarring tho&s;e that were neare&s;t in blood, but never with &s;o much rea|&s;on as now: Wherefore it doth enact, <Q>that the Duke &s;hould be, and was thereby excluded; declares him at|tainted of high Trea&s;on, if he land|ed in England before or after the

King's death; forbids commerce or corre&s;pondency with him, under the &s;ame penalty of Trea&s;on.</Q> This plea&s;|eth the City &s;o well, that a petition is framing there, which will be pre|&s;ented in two Days, &s;igned by one hundred thou&s;and men, to give thanks unto the Parliament for their vigorous proceeding in di&s;covering the Plot, and oppo&s;ing of Popery, and promi&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in &s;o doing with their lives and fortunes.</P>

<P>YOUR Nephew arrived here la&s;t night, and I going to welcome him, received your letter from him.

<P>This day was &s;e'nnight the proro|gation of the Parliament was &s;poken of, but being then uncertain, and (as I thought) not like to be, I was not
<PB N="77" REF="73">
willing to mention it; but it fell out the next day, and all men's wits have been &s;crewed ever &s;ince that day to find out the con&s;equences. Every body hath had his conjecture, and the mo&s;t ignorant &s;hewed them&s;elves the mo&s;t bold, in a&s;&s;erting their opinions. Many find that the King would not have done it, if he had not re&s;olved to &s;end for the Duke; keep up the Army; de&s;ire a&s;&s;i&s;tances from abroad; &s;ell Jer|&s;ey and Tangier to the French, (for which Mr. Savile is to make the bar|gain) &s;et the Earl of Danby at liberty, and with the help of the Papi&s;ts and Bi&s;hops &s;et up for him&s;elf. But in&s;tead of this, we &s;ee little rea&s;on to believe the Duke will think him&s;elf well here: The Army is in part di&s;banded, and had been entirely before this day, if it
<PB N="78" REF="74">
had plea&s;ed Colonel Birch. The place from whence the foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tances &s;hould come is not known: Mr. Sa|vile is not thought very good at &s;uch Treaties: The Earl of Danby is like to lie where he is, and the utmo&s;t help his Maje&s;ty can (for ought I hear) ex|pect, until the Parliament do meet, is, by Fox, Kent, and Duncomb's credit, which perhaps will not be found to be a very &s;teddy foundation. No man will avow having been the King's Coun&s;ellor in this bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;ome wonder, that his Maje&s;ty in con&s;titut|ing the privy Council, having promi&s;ed that he would have no cabinet Coun|cil, but that he would in all things fol|low their advices, next unto tho&s;e of his great Council the Parliament; &s;hould &s;o &s;uddenly prorogue that great
<PB N="79" REF="75">
Council, without &s;o much as a&s;king the other. This fills men with many ill humours; the Parliament-men go down di&s;contented, and are like by their reports to add unto the di&s;con|tents of the Countries, which are al|ready very great; and the fears from the Papi&s;ts at home, and their friends abroad, being added thereunto, they begin to look more than formerly unto the means of pre&s;erving them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There hath been a &s;uit at Law in Scotland, between the Earl of Argyle, and one Macclaine a great man in the Highlands, and the Earl (as is &s;aid) by the favour of Duke Latherdale, hath obtained a decree for the Lands in que&s;tion; which by order from hence, is to be put in execution, by the
<PB N="80" REF="76">
&s;trength of all the King's forces in Scotland, and fire and &s;word to be u&s;ed in ca&s;e they find re&s;i&s;tance; as probably they will, Macclaine re&s;olving he will not be turned out of his ancient inheri|tance by a trick in law, and a decree from corrupt Judges: This Man being head of a numerous and &s;tout people, helped by the fa&s;tne&s;s and poverty of their Country, may perhaps make good what he propo&s;eth unto him&s;elf; and to &s;hew he is not to be &s;urpri&s;ed, he hath already entered into Argyle's Country with 800 or 1000 men. The Earl of Athol is his neighbour, friend, and enemy to Argyle, &s;o as it is be|lieved, he may give him &s;ecret a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance at the fir&s;t, and afterwards more openly. About the &s;ame time a pro|clamation was there publi&s;hed, mak|ing
<PB N="81" REF="77" MS="y">
it Trea&s;on to be pre&s;ent at any of the Field-Conventicles that are armed; and every man knowing the pre&s;&s;ures they are expo&s;ed unto if they go di&s;|armed, they mu&s;t incurr the penalties, or ab&s;tain wholly from going, which they will hardly be per&s;waded unto. Things being thus brought unto ex|tremities, the King hath been per|&s;waded to give a hearing unto what the Duke Hamilton, and other Scotch Lords, have to &s;ay again&s;t Latherdale, as is appointed before the Council.</P>
<P>Two a&s;&s;ociates were offered unto Sir Thomas Chichely, for the better executing of his Office of Ma&s;ter of the Ordnance; but he thinking that an affront to a man of &s;o eminent abili|ties as him&s;elf, refu&s;ed them, which
<PB N="82" REF="78">
hath obliged the King to di&s;mi&s;s him from the place, and put it into com|mi&s;&s;ion, as &s;ome others have been; Sir Thomas Littleton, Sir William Hick|man, and Sir Jo&s;eph Lowther are &s;aid to be the men. If what is &s;aid be true, the ill management of the Trea|&s;ury was not more extreme, than this of the Ordnance; for be&s;ides the ex|travagancies of furni&s;hing the French Armies with arms and ammunition, (whereas the Stores where fuller two years ago than ever they were known to have been) there are now but &s;ix hundred mu&s;kets in the Tower, and other things in proportion.</P>
<P>Some think the&s;e ways of <HI>employing many Parliament-men,</HI> may &s;trengthen the King's party in the Hou&s;e. Others
<PB N="83" REF="79">
think, that a <HI>King is ever a lo&s;er when he enters into a Faction, and ban|dys again&s;t his Subjects;</HI> be&s;ides that the&s;e men will lo&s;e their credit, and, having only &s;ingle votes, will be over|powered by number. I do not find the new privy Coun&s;ellors well at ea&s;e, and am not free from &s;ear, that whil&s;t they endeavour to keep fair with both parties, they may give di&s;ta&s;te unto both. Harry Sydney is to go Envoy extraor|dinary into Holland, and ye&s;terday the King declared unto him his intention to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Vanlieu the Holland Amba&s;&s;ador is arrived, and Van Beuninghen going away. He made the la&s;t week a great noi&s;e about a me&s;&s;age &s;ent by the King of France unto his Ma&s;ters, concern|ing
<PB N="84" REF="80">
the contribution-money due from the Country about Breda; denouncing in a very terrible manner, his inten|tion of levying it by force, if it were not paid; and that in an <HI>Ottoman</HI> &s;tile, which unto &s;ome &s;illy people gave as &s;illy a hope, that the peace would break, and the league be renew|ed again&s;t the French; but the French Amba&s;&s;ador &s;ays, it is a thing of no moment at all, and already compo&s;ed. However I &s;ee no inclinations in di&s;|creet men here, to de&s;ire &s;uch a di&s;|compo&s;ure of things abroad, as &s;hould engage us to take any part in them, until our affairs are better &s;ettled at home than they are yet like to be.</P>
<P>Ireland is in extreme di&s;order, by the Duke of Ormond's negligence, ig|norance,

Dou|gla&s;s his Regiment thinking to u&s;e the &s;ame licentiou&s;ne&s;s at Kin&s;ale, as it had been accu&s;tomed unto in France, gives great di&s;ta&s;te, and apprehen&s;ions of &s;uch works as began almo&s;t by the &s;ame ways in 1641. Old Roberts, in appearing of late for the King and Bi&s;hops, thinks him&s;elf of merit to &s;uc|ceed him; but he is as &s;ingular in that opinion as in many others.</P>
<P>Some that know matters better than I do, mu&s;t tell you, whether we &s;hall have the &s;ame Parliament, at the end of the prorogation, or a new one, or none at all. But I think, this, or ano|ther will be found nece&s;&s;ary; and if this be di&s;&s;olved, another will be cho|&s;en of le&s;s inclinations to favour the

<P>There hath been a &s;uit at Law de|pending this good while in Scotland, between the Earl of Argyle, and one Macclaine, the head of a great and nu|merous family in the Highlands. The Earl (as is &s;aid) by the help of the Duke of Latherdale, obtained of late a Decree for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lands
<PB N="88" REF="84">
in que&s;tion, and an order was &s;ent from hence unto the King's Officers, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Earl in executing the de|cree, and u&s;e fire and &s;word again&s;t &s;uch as &s;hould oppo&s;e it; which was &s;o far pro&s;ecuted, that he with 300 of the King's men and 500 of his own, rai&s;ed upon an I&s;land of Macclaine's, which he was not able to defend, or perhaps thought it his be&s;t cour&s;e by way of diver&s;ion to draw Argyle from thence; but what rea&s;on &s;oever per|&s;waded him, he &s;aid he would not be put out of the Inheritance of his An|ce&s;tors by a trick in law, and the cor|ruption of the Judges; and joining the Macdonnells unto him&s;elf, fell into Argyle's Country with near 3000 men, where he found no re&s;i&s;tance; the Lady of Argyle was obliged to leave
<PB N="89" REF="85">
her hou&s;e, and in &s;ome ha&s;te retired to Edinborough to get relief, which could not ea&s;ily be granted, le&s;t the Fana|ticks &s;hould take advantage of the King's forces being &s;o employed. Some &s;ay this is only a family feud, others believe it hath a deeper root; but what|&s;oever this is, no man doubts of the truth of the news brought hither by an expre&s;s on Saturday morning; which is, that the Conventicle-men in the County of Gla&s;cow are in arms; that one Captain Grimes coming &s;ome|thing too near them, with his Troop and other forces, was beaten back, with the lo&s;s of his Cornet and fourteen Troopers; which according to the po&s;ture he found them in, he was per|&s;waded to content him&s;elf with, ra|ther than to pre&s;s farther. The Coun|cil
<PB N="90" REF="86">
was called upon this occa&s;ion on Saturday la&s;t, but nothing (as I hear) re&s;olved until they hear more, &s;ome doubting whether it be a laid bu&s;ine&s;s, or a &s;udden tumult rai&s;ed by accident. I know not the truth of this, but <HI>the di&s;cour&s;es I have heard very often of late, of tho&s;e who every day expected &s;ome &s;uch thing,</HI> per&s;wades me to be|lieve it is not fallen out by chance. Though no re&s;olution was taken at Council upon this matter, it is &s;aid, that private orders are given out to &s;e|veral Officers of the late di&s;banded Troops, to get their men again toge|ther; and to others, upon the mo&s;t plau&s;ible pretences that they can in|vent, to delay their di&s;banding as much as may be. The&s;e &s;u&s;picions go too far, and already reach &s;ome of your

<P>THE Scotch news that I men|tioned to you la&s;t week, doth &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s the minds of all men here; but all relations that come from Scot|land are &s;o imperfect, that no man knows what to make of them; and tho&s;e that come to Court being more particularly &s;o than others, no men are thought to under&s;tand le&s;s of the bu|&s;ine&s;s than Privy Coun&s;ellors. This is attributed to Latherdale; and though it be concluded, that what he &s;ays is not true, &s;ome think the bu&s;ine&s;s wor&s;e, others better, than it is repre&s;ented.
<PB N="94" REF="90">
The fact, as far as I hear, is, that the Earl of Lithco with above five and twenty hundred hor&s;e and foot did come within a few miles of the Con|venticle-men, and finding them in &s;uch a po&s;ture, as he did not think it pru|dent to charge them, he concluded the be&s;t was to let them take Gla&s;cow, where they are &s;aid to have found good &s;tore of arms, ammunition and &s;ome cannon, and having left &s;o many men in the Town as are thought &s;uf|ficient to guard it, they march with four pieces. They are &s;aid to encrea&s;e in number every day, but we know nothing of them certainly, unle&s;s it be that they have no landed men among&s;t them, nor any Gentlemen, but a young|er brother to a Knight of the Hamil|ton family. The la&s;t week we heard
<PB N="95" REF="91">
of nothing but rai&s;ing of great forces to &s;ubdue the&s;e Rebels. The Dukes of Monmouth, Albemarle, and Lord Garret were to have Regiments of Hor&s;e, Fever&s;ham one of Dragoons and Grenadiers, the Lord Cavendi&s;h, Grey of Werk, Mr. T. Thinne, and &s;ome others, Regiments of Foot; but that heat &s;eems to be &s;omething abated. The Lord Grey gave up his Commi&s;&s;ion, Mr. Thinne refu&s;ed to take any; Ca|vendi&s;h doth not rai&s;e any men upon his, and Garret &s;wears he will not be at a penny charge to rai&s;e a man, but if the Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Trea&s;ury will rai&s;e him a Regiment, and provide money to pay it, he will command it. Whil&s;t ways were &s;ought to remove the&s;e difficulties, the Scotch Lords that are here endeavoured to per&s;wade the
<PB N="96" REF="92">
King, that the bu&s;ine&s;s may be ended by far more certain and le&s;s chargeable ways, in as much as the&s;e men having been driven into a nece&s;&s;ity of taking arms, by the extreme pre&s;&s;ure &s;uffered from tho&s;e that did abu&s;e the autho|rity his Maje&s;ty had tru&s;ted them with, the people being ea&s;ed of tho&s;e bur|thens, the per&s;ons removed that had cau&s;ed them, and &s;uch men placed in the Government, as were acceptable to the Nation, they dur&s;t undertake that all may be compo&s;ed without blood. This was not (as I hear) di&s;liked, but another point was &s;tarted, that doth yet more incline the Court to mild cour&s;es; which is, in the Year 1641 Acts of Parliament were made in both Kingdoms, making it Trea&s;on for any per&s;on belonging unto either to make
<PB N="97" REF="93">
war upon or invade the other, without the con&s;ent of Parliament. And though one or two of the Judges &s;ay, that the Acts being reciprocal, the Scots having re&s;cinded theirs, ours falls of it&s;elf; or though it did not, the act forbid|ding an Inva&s;ion, no ways toucheth &s;uch as by the King's command &s;hould go to &s;ubdue Rebels; others &s;ay, that what the Scots did might indeed give unto the Parliament of England a ju&s;t ground of annulling their act al&s;o, but not having done it, no man can doubt but it remains in force; and who&s;o|ever marcheth again&s;t Scotland incurrs the penalties of Trea&s;on denounced by it. And &s;ome that were pre&s;ent at the making of it, are &s;o far from ap|proving the di&s;tinction between <HI>in|vading</HI> and <HI>&s;ubduing Rebels,</HI> as to &s;ay,
<PB N="98" REF="94">
that the Parliament then finding they had been upon the like pretence en|gaged again&s;t Scotland in 1638 and 39, made this act expre&s;sly to hinder any &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s as that which is now depending; and to take care, that England &s;hould never be again engaged again&s;t Scotland, without the con&s;ent of the Parliament; which was al&s;o the rea&s;on why the act was conti|nued in force on our &s;ide, though it was di&s;&s;olved on theirs. This renders men of e&s;tates unwilling to engage, and hereupon the Duke of Monmouth was &s;ent away ye&s;terday in &s;uch ha&s;te, as to carry no more company with him, than could go in one day to your good town of Newark, where he was to lodge the la&s;t night. He is fur|ni&s;hed with powers of indulgence to
<PB N="99" REF="95">
compo&s;e rather than de&s;troy; and the Lord Melvin (who is thought well enough inclined to Non-conformi&s;ts, and well liked by them) is &s;ent with him, as being thought a fit Mini&s;ter of a good agreement. The foot that was embarqued in the Thames is gone for Barwick, where it is to &s;tay to &s;e|cure the Town; and the other forces, that are newly entertained, are to con|tinue only for a Month. This looks as if your friend Latherdale may with|in a while be le&s;t as naked as the Earl of Danby. The army is almo&s;t every where di&s;banded, unle&s;s it be the&s;e that upon this occa&s;ion are again taken into pay, and the Countries almo&s;t every where expre&s;s the utmo&s;t hatred unto them, as &s;oon as they have laid down their arms. Douglas his Regiment now

as Traitors. On Saturday the like &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon Langhorne. The trials were in all re&s;pects fair, even by the confe&s;&s;ion of the adver&s;aries. The arraigned per&s;ons placed all the hopes of their defence upon the inva|lidating of Oates his te&s;timony, to which end they had about 16 witne&s;&s;es &s;ent from St. Omer's, to a&s;&s;ert that they had &s;een him every day in May and June was a twelve month at St. Omer's, and con&s;equently he could not be here as he doth a&s;&s;ert; but as three of them, having been apprehended by Sir Will. Waller at their fir&s;t coming, told him they were come to be witne&s;&s;es, and being a&s;ked what they were to witne&s;s, they &s;aid they mu&s;t know that from their &s;uperiors; it did plainly appear at the trial, that they were ready to &s;ay
<PB N="102" REF="98">
whatever they were bid; and Oates did plainly prove by a Knight and two of his &s;ervants, two Prote&s;tant Par|&s;ons, a Popi&s;h Prie&s;t, and &s;ome others, that he was here at that time; &s;o as his te&s;timony was taken without di&s;|pute. This is a dangerous leading ca&s;e for the Lords in the Tower, who&s;e principal hopes were to invalidate the te&s;timony of Oates, Bedloe, and Dug|dale; all which being confirmed by the judgment of a jury in the face of all London, cannot be que&s;tioned. Wakeman was to have been tried the &s;ame day, but being arraigned the trial was put off for a month, as is &s;aid, at the &s;ollicitation of the Portugal Am|ba&s;&s;ador, and in a way that to many &s;eemed &s;candalous.

<P>I TOLD you in my la&s;t, that the Duke of Monmouth was gone to|wards <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ince which time re|ports have been &s;o various, that no man well knows what to make of that bu&s;ine&s;s; and the cau&s;e of this uncer|tainty is imputed to the diligence of the King's Officers, who intercept and keep all letters directed unto per&s;ons any ways &s;u&s;pected, &s;o as no more is known, than they think fit to divulge. An expre&s;s arrived here on Saturday-night from Edinburgh, and brought news that the Duke of Monmouth arrived there on Wedne&s;day: That he
<PB N="105" REF="101">
had been received with great joy, and as much honour, as tho&s;e that were there could &s;hew unto him: That the Council having been immediately call|ed, he expo&s;ed unto them his Com|mi&s;&s;ion, which was very well liked: That the Chancellor invited him to &s;upper that night, and that he was the next morning to go to the Army, having fir&s;t &s;ent an expre&s;s to the Lord Lithco, that commands it, no ways to engage in any action before he comes. Some think that he hath the Conven|ticle-men at an advantage, and will pur&s;ue it to their de&s;truction. Others &s;ay, that upon the extreme aver&s;ion that is &s;hewn all over England to a War in Scotland, and the little probability yet appearing of the Parliament's being any ways engageable in it, he hath receiv|ed
<PB N="106" REF="102">
much more gentle in&s;tructions, and intends, by the help of the Lord Mel|vin, to compo&s;e tho&s;e bu&s;ine&s;&s;es if he can; and if he can accompli&s;h it, will certainly render him&s;elf very popular in England and Scotland.</P>
<P>The Duke Hamilton and &s;ome other Scotch Lords, having let his Maje&s;ty know, that the di&s;orders in Scotland proceeded only from the extreme pre&s;|&s;ures the people was brought under, by tho&s;e who contrary to Law ab|u&s;ed the power his Maje&s;ty had tru&s;ted them with, did undertake to fini&s;h all without blood, if he would be plea&s;ed to ea&s;e them of tho&s;e pre&s;|&s;ures, and, removing tho&s;e who had cau&s;ed them, put the Government of the Kingdom into the hands of &s;uch per&s;ons as were well-plea&s;ing unto the
<PB N="107" REF="103">
Nation. This having been taken into con&s;ideration for &s;ome days, the Duke Hamilton with the re&s;t, and one Loc|kart, were &s;ent for by the King, who told them, the points formerly &s;poken of did relate unto his <HI>Prerogative,</HI> which in <HI>three points</HI> he would not &s;uffer to be touched: 1&s;t, That he having a right of di&s;po&s;ing of all <HI>places,</HI> might incapacitate &s;uch per&s;ons as he &s;hould think fit: 2dly, That it belonging to him to prevent <HI>con&s;pira|cies,</HI> he might &s;ecure and impri&s;on &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons; and that there was no &s;uch thing as a Habeas Corpus in Scotland, nor &s;hould be as long as he liv'd: 3dly, That it being his part to prevent or to quell <HI>rebellions,</HI> he might rai&s;e &s;uch forces as he plea&s;ed, quarter them where he thought fit, and em|ploy
<PB N="108" REF="104">
them as occa&s;ion &s;hould require. To which Lockart replied, that the <HI>places</HI> in que&s;tion were tho&s;e belonging to Counties and Corporations, which had ever been cho&s;en by the <HI>people</HI> re|&s;pectively according to their Charters. And fora&s;much as concerns <HI>con&s;piracies</HI> and <HI>rebellions,</HI> he thought he could prove, that what his Maje&s;ty did a&s;|&s;ert did neither agree with the Laws of Scotland, nor any other Law, nor the ends for which that, or any other Government was con&s;tituted.</P>
<P>The next point in di&s;cour&s;e was con|cerning &s;ome articles exhibited again&s;t Latherdale; in which it is &s;aid, that <Q>his Maje&s;ty for &s;everal years pa&s;&s;ed had been utterly mi&s;informed, and never known the truth of any thing relating unto Scotland, but been
<PB N="109" REF="105">
guided by &s;uch reports as be&s;t &s;uited with Latherdale's intere&s;ts.</Q> That he had been thereby induced to bring down the la&s;t year that army of bar|barous Highlanders, upon pretence of mutinous and &s;editious Field-conventi|cles; whereas &s;uch meetings as had been, were mode&s;t and quiet; and quartered them in tho&s;e countries where there never had been any at all. Several other mi&s;demeanors are &s;aid to be mentioned, and among&s;t others, that of Michell, who had been put to death after having had a promi&s;e of life and limb, by fal&s;e oaths made by Lather|dale and &s;ome others of the privy Council. The conclu&s;ion was, the King commanded the Duke that <HI>the&s;e articles &s;hould not be made publick.</HI> In which he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, fora&s;much
<PB N="110" REF="106">
as having done nothing in the dark, &s;everal copies had been taken, which were not in his power. Some &s;ay, we &s;hall this day &s;ee them in print, with the Declaration of the Conventicle|men, printed at Gla&s;cow, which is very well worth &s;eeing. The forces of the&s;e Conventicle-men, or, as they call them|&s;elves, the We&s;tern Army, are vari|ou&s;ly reported. Some &s;ay, they have 14000 or 15000 Men; others, that this Day was a &s;e'nnight they had, not far from Stirling, between two and three thou&s;and Hor&s;e, well armed and mounted, with about the like number of Foot; that a brother of the Earl of Galloway was coming to them, and within three hours march, with above four hundred hor&s;e and foot, and that they had parties of good &s;trength in &s;everal other places.</P>

<P>There is a certain Petition prepar|ing in London to be pre&s;ented unto the King, which, as is &s;aid, will be &s;ign|ed by many Lords, Gentlemen, and all the principal hou&s;e-holders of the City of London, taking notice of the Ar|my having been rai&s;ed upon pretence of the French War, kept up by Dan|by's means contrary to an Act of Par|liament,
<PB N="113" REF="109">
as a &s;tanding Army. In the next place it mentions the Acts of Parliament made in England and Scot|land, making it Trea&s;on for the &s;ub|jects of either kingdom to invade the other, or the &s;ubjects thereof, giving power and enjoining all other &s;ubjects of either to fall upon and de&s;troy &s;uch as &s;hould in any time attempt to do it, as rebels and traitors; and &s;hewing the dangerous con&s;equences of forcing the Prote&s;tants of his kingdom to imbrue their hands in each other's blood, if according to the rumour &s;pread of a war in Scotland, any men &s;hould con|trary to the act march again&s;t them; de&s;iring his Maje&s;ty to put an end to their fears in that point, compo&s;e things there, &s;uffer the Parliament to meet the 14th of Augu&s;t, bring Dan|by

<P>I WRITE to you now rather to keep my day, than from an opinion that the&s;e la&s;t days have produced any thing that de&s;erves to be communi|cated unto you. The news concerning the Scots, mentioned in my la&s;t, is con|firmed by &s;everal expre&s;&s;es, and all &s;hew their defeat to have been entire, the party di&s;&s;ipated, and tho&s;e who e&s;|caped the fury of the &s;word remain expo&s;ed to the di&s;cretion of their con|querors. I find men's judgments as various, as to the u&s;e will be made of
<PB N="119" REF="115">
this advantage, as of the Duke of Mon|mouth's action in what is pa&s;&s;ed. Some did think that they being a poor peo|ple, brought into de&s;pair by the mo&s;t violent per&s;ecution, pitied by all both in England and Scotland, helped by none, without head or conduct, were to be &s;pared; and that in doing &s;o, he might have made him&s;elf very po|pular in both Kingdoms, (which he is thought with rea&s;on much to de&s;ire) and be&s;t to have provided for the King's intere&s;t. Others, who look upon it as a fine thing to kill a great many men, and believe Monarchies are be&s;t kept up by terrour, extol the action, and &s;ay there is no other way of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing old rebellions, or preventing new ones, than by force and rigour; looking up|on Caligula as a great State&s;man, and
<PB N="120" REF="116">
<HI>oderint dum metuant</HI> as a good maxim. Some think that the Duke of Mon|mouth's fir&s;t in&s;tructions were accord|ing to the fir&s;t of the&s;e ways, but that he was followed by others, which &s;a|voured much of the &s;econd; tho&s;e that were of the fir&s;t opinion, do now think the be&s;t way were to compo&s;e things there, and by &s;hewing indulgence not only in &s;paring tho&s;e that are obnoxi|ous, but in giving them &s;uch indul|gence in matters of con&s;cience, as may &s;atisfy them, prevent the like, and plea&s;e the Body of the Engli&s;h Nation, which hath given many tokens of be|ing much concerned for them. On the other &s;ide, tho&s;e are not wanting who think the be&s;t way of bringing that &s;tubborn people into &s;ubjection, and keep 'em, as they call it in peace, free from
<PB N="121" REF="117">
rebellions, is to u&s;e the utmo&s;t rigour upon tho&s;e that are in their power, and to di&s;cover who did in any mea&s;ure a&s;&s;i&s;t or abet them; and in order there|unto the pri&s;oners are u&s;ed mo&s;t cruel|ly, and it is &s;aid, that at the lea&s;t forty of the mo&s;t noted men among&s;t them &s;hall be put into the <HI>Boots</HI> my Lord of Latherdale hath brought into fa&s;hion, to make them di&s;cover what corre&s;pon|dence the great men held with them. I know not how far this may concern &s;ome that are, or lately have been here but it is probable enough they may have the fortune that ordinarily accompa|nies them that pretending to be very &s;ubtile and keep well with both &s;ides, ever do too much or too little; and that whereas they might have prevent|ed all tumults, if they had endeavoured
<PB N="122" REF="118">
it, by denying all manner of favour to the di&s;contented people; or reformed the &s;tate of that Kingdom, if they would have taken the conduct of them, and very well provided for their own intere&s;t by either way, may have ruin|ed the&s;e poor people by &s;tirring them up, and leaving them to them&s;elves; brought the whole Nation under the power of their enemy, and given &s;uch advantages again&s;t them&s;elves, as may be their ruin, if they are pur&s;ued; that is, to peri&s;h or be &s;aved by the mercy of him they profe&s;s to abhor. Duke Hamilton complains he is ruined by this bu&s;ine&s;s, and that not only all the provi&s;ions of victuals and corn and gra&s;s upon the ground is de&s;troyed, but that there is not a Cow, one Hor&s;e or Sheep left upon his whole e&s;tate; and
<PB N="123" REF="119">
his own hou&s;e had been plundered, if the Duke of Monmouth had not &s;ent an Officer to pre&s;erve it. But Lather|dale &s;ays, he cannot believe that Hamil|ton's friends, tenants, and &s;ervants, would &s;o far forget their dependence, obligations and good manners, as to deal uncivilly with him. Such as are near unto tho&s;e who manage bu&s;ine&s;&s;es may &s;peak po&s;itively of them, but I mu&s;t as you &s;ee &s;u&s;pend my judgment, until the Duke of Monmouth comes back, which is expected in a few days.</P>
<P>The Petition I mentioned in my la&s;t did meet with &s;ome interruption, but the defeat of the Scots put an end to it. Tho&s;e who u&s;e to extol all that relates to Rome, admire the con&s;tancy of the five Prie&s;ts executed the la&s;t week,

but we &s;imple people find no more in it, than that the Papi&s;ts, by arts formerly unknown to mankind, have found ways of reconciling fal&s;hood in the utmo&s;t degree with the hopes of &s;alvation, and at the be&s;t have no more to brag of, than that they have made men dye with lies in their mouths. Langhorne's di&s;coveries being trivial, relating only to lands of a &s;mall value belonging to Convents, I think he will be hanged this day or to-morrow. Wakeman's trial is put off, as is believed to avoid the indecency of the di&s;cour&s;es that would have been made. This day and to-morrow will bring all the Court to Wind&s;or.

<P>Mon&s;ieur de Flamarin hath been received at Wind&s;or as &s;eriou&s;ly, as if it had been believed the Queen of Spain's marriage &s;hould not hold, unle&s;s it were here approved, and the forma|lities that are u&s;ual with men of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, having been ob&s;erved to him, he is grown to think he is &s;o.

his hands upon his thighs, &s;hewing the delight he hath in the &s;harpne&s;s of the &s;ound that te&s;tifies the plumpne&s;s and hardne&s;s of his fle&s;h; and certainly if this climate did not nouri&s;h him better than any other, the hairs in his no&s;e, and nails of his fingers could not grow &s;o fa&s;t as to furni&s;h enough of the one to pull out, and of the other to cut off in all Companies, which being done he picks his ears with as good a grace as my Lord La.

joins with them; but the King find|ing it would not pa&s;s at Council, takes it wholly upon him&s;elf; tho' that, as well as &s;ome other things of the like nature, are thought not well to agree with what his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to declare when he made the new Coun|cil, to have no Cabinet Council, but next unto the advices of the Parlia|ment to follow their's in all things; and the world looking upon this as the work of the three above mentioned, they begin to be &s;poken of all over England in the &s;ame manner as Dan|by, and I fear, may be impeached the next Parliament upon this point, and the War in Scotland, as is &s;aid, con|trary to an act Parliament in the Year 1641. The new Parliament is to meet on the 7th of October: there
<PB N="136" REF="132">
will be as great canva&s;&s;ing for Places as ever, people believing this Parlia|ment was di&s;&s;olved only in hopes of having one that would be le&s;s careful of the publick intere&s;t.

<P>The Lord of Wilt&s;hire's marriage with Mrs. Coventry was the la&s;t week
<PB N="137" REF="133">
celebrated with great &s;olemnity; and ye&s;terday the young couple came to the Marque&s;s of Winche&s;ter's hou&s;e, where there was a mighty fea&s;t, and much dancing and rejoicing. Lang|horne was ye&s;terday hanged, profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame innocence that the Je&s;uites did, and had the fortune as well as they, to be believed only by tho&s;e that are in the &s;ame crimes, or are con|cerned in having them concealed. This day the Council was extraordi|narily a&s;&s;embled at Hampton-Court, to con&s;ider of Wakeman's bu&s;ine&s;s, with its con&s;equences, which notwith|&s;tanding he is to be tried to-morrow at the Old Baily.</P>
<P>The la&s;t week the King gave the Scotch Lords a hearing again&s;t Lather|dale;
<PB N="138" REF="134">
they had coun&s;el on both &s;ides; Lockart and Cunningham did under|take to prove a multitude of things done by Latherdale to have been a|gain&s;t law; and Mackenzy, the King's Advocate, being of coun&s;el for him, could no ways di&s;prove them, but had recour&s;e unto the Royal Authority. The Lords of E&s;&s;ex and Halifax were pre&s;ent, and both of them, but e&s;pe|cially the latter, did very much uphold the complainants, and, among&s;t other things, told the King he &s;aw the Sco|ti&s;h nation was more free than the Engli&s;h. Neverthele&s;s an&s;wer was re|turned to them, that Latherdale had done nothing but what his Maje&s;ty had commanded, and which he would up|hold by virtue of his <HI>prerogative,</HI> which was <HI>above the law.</HI> This, as is thought,
<PB N="139" REF="135">
will pre&s;erve him from puni&s;hment, but his place of Secretary will be given to the Lord Magennis.</P>
<P>The Duke of Monmouth, before he came from Scotland, had taken care that the Scotch Pri&s;oners &s;hould be u&s;ed with more humanity than they found among&s;t their Countrymen, and &s;ince his arrival here, orders are &s;ent to enlarge the indulgence granted unto the Non-conformi&s;ts in their meetings. The re&s;ult of that bu&s;ine&s;s, as far as I under&s;tand it, is, a great many fools have been killed; their blood lies upon Latherdale; their folly and the cruelty &s;hewed unto them hath gained a great deal of compa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e that re|main of their party, which probably will per&s;wade tho&s;e in authority here
<PB N="140" REF="136">
to proceed more gently; and that which is rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, will be rendered ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, if the Parliament be &s;uffered to &s;it; for un|le&s;s they prove to be of a temper very different from what is expected, they will &s;uffer nothing like unto that which hath been.</P>
<P>A bu&s;ine&s;s happened lately which makes a great deal of noi&s;e. A cer|tain Captain under the &s;helter of the African Company committed &s;everal Piracies upon the Engli&s;h Company trading in Turky, and lately coming to town, five or &s;ix principal Merchants that had received the damage, arre&s;ted him, whereupon he complained to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty, who &s;ent for the Merchants, and upon their
<PB N="141" REF="137">
refu&s;al to relea&s;e the Captain, commit|ted them. They addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to one of the Judges for a Habeas Cor|pus, who before he granted it, gave notice unto the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that the commitment of the Merchants was again&s;t Law, advi&s;ed their relea&s;e be|fore the Habeas Corpus was granted, which could not be denied, which the Commi&s;&s;ioners refu&s;ed to do; but ad|vi&s;ing farther with Lawyers, found not only that what they had done was un|warrantable, but that they were &s;ub|ject to actions for fal&s;e impri&s;onment, upon which the injured per&s;ons would obtain great damages; &s;o as they found no better way than to relea&s;e the men, with a great many fair words: But they not being therewith &s;atisfied, re&s;olved to &s;ue them at law, or bring the bu&s;i|ne&s;s

<P>I HAVE been out of Town almo&s;t this month, &s;o as my la&s;t letter to you was dated about that time. At my return I found men's minds more di&s;turbed than ever I remember them to have been, &s;o as there is no extremity of di&s;order to be imagined, that we might not probably have fallen into if the King had died, or that may not yet rea&s;onably be feared if he &s;hould relap&s;e.

Though the Parliament is like to &s;ig|nify little, people are bu&s;y in bringing tho&s;e in, who are of their own mind; and the party that is mo&s;t aver&s;e to the Court &s;eems to prevail in the Counties and great Corporations, as the other doth in many of the &s;mall Boroughs; and upon the whole matter, many be|lieve the Hou&s;e will be compo&s;ed as the la&s;t was, or, as &s;ome think, of a more har&s;h humour, the &s;ame men be|ing &s;omething &s;harpened.</P>
<P>Your friend the Lord Latherdale is more powerful than ever in Scotland, openly oppo&s;eth the Duke of Mon|mouth, and hath &s;o far prevailed, as to render the indulgences obtained by him utterly ineffectual: But le&s;t his power there &s;hould not be &s;ufficient

<P>IT is indeed a good while &s;ince I heard from you, and I have been le&s;s diligent in writing to you than formerly, partly becau&s;e I doubted, whether my letters were any ways ac|ceptable unto you, and partly becau&s;e one that is far from Court knows no|thing worth relating, unle&s;s it be in Parliament-time, when all that is done is made publick, or at the lea&s;t comes to the knowledge of tho&s;e that have any acquaintance.

<P>I have often heard of Mon&s;ieur D'Avaux his behaviour in Holland, but did not need any information as to matter of fact, to be a&s;&s;ured he would oppo&s;e it; to believe he would &s;uc|ceed, and indeed with &s;ome confi|dence to conclude, that our di&s;ap|pointment in that ca&s;e is much more for our advantage than what we &s;ought. And as it is &s;aid in Religion, that nothing is more terrible than the return of ill-conceived prayers, nothing is more to be feared in Politicks than the &s;ucce&s;s of unrea&s;onable and ill|grounded coun&s;els. And though the <Q>propo&s;ition that was made, being
<PB N="150" REF="146">
rejected, will certainly rai&s;e the par|ty in Holland that is lea&s;t for the Prince of Orange, and ca&s;t it into a <HI>dependence upon France;</HI> that is le&s;s mortal unto us than a <HI>League,</HI> that would certainly have produced a rupture of the peace, renewed the war all over Europe, expo&s;ed Flan|ders to be lo&s;t the fir&s;t year (which this mu&s;t have done;</Q> it being as certain, the a&s;&s;i&s;tances expected from hence would have failed, as that it hath not in it&s;elf that which is nece&s;|&s;ary for its Defence.) This, and a great deal more upon the like &s;ubject was told the Lord Sunderland, and Mr. H. Sydney before he went; but Sir William, who was taken for the oracle of tho&s;e parts, a&s;&s;ured them, there was no &s;uch thing as a
<PB N="151" REF="147">
party in Holland inclined to oppo&s;e the Prince of Orange: That all was &s;ub|mitted unto his authority, and united in de&s;iring &s;uch an alliance with us: That it would certainly be accepted as &s;oon as offered, and that the French which had made the Peace for fear of us, would by the &s;ame rea&s;on more exactly keep it, when it was &s;een that we were joined with them. I &s;hould think him bewitched, that doth not &s;ee there is as many fal&s;ities, as to mat|ter of fact, and mi&s;takes in judgment in this matter, as there are words; but I &s;ee no intention of receding from &s;uch coun&s;els, nor remedy for the mi&s;chiefs they bring upon us. It was al&s;o believed this Bu&s;ine&s;s would have been liked by the Parliament, but I am as confident, as of this that is
<PB N="152" REF="148">
pa&s;&s;ed, that if the Parliament had met, neither this nor any thing that is like to engage us in any war, would have been endured by them, nor that they would have given a Penny towards it.</P>
<P>You will certainly have heard of a precious <HI>plot,</HI> carried on by a man of four names (who had been almo&s;t as many times in the pillory for perjury, and &s;uch other pieces of wit) where|by the Pre&s;byterians &s;hould be brought under the &s;u&s;picion of having one now on foot, which &s;hould have given oc|ca&s;ion of bailing the Lords in the Tower: But he having had the ill luck to mi&s;take Man&s;ell for Mansfield, carried a bundle of letters, he had forg|ed, to a wrong place; and bringing &s;ome officers of the cu&s;toms to &s;earch
<PB N="153" REF="149">
Man&s;ell's lodgings for Flanders lace, and other prohibited commodities, was fain to find them him&s;elf; but the mi&s;take of the &s;uper&s;cription, which was to Mansfield, the &s;eals not opened, and other circum&s;tances making the fraud to appear, the whole matter va|ni&s;hed. About the &s;ame time another de&s;ign of equal prudence and integri|ty was carried on to &s;uborn Dugdale to renounce his te&s;timony concerning the Popi&s;h plot; but he con&s;ulted with &s;ome friends, placed two good wit|ne&s;&s;es under the hanging to te&s;tify what the woman &s;aid, who treated with him; and when he &s;aw a fit time, di&s;covered all to the council, &s;o as that plot al&s;o is enervated.

but as things &s;tand, none dares appear. Serjeant, long &s;poken of, hath depo&s;ed what he knows, and, as I hear, deliver|ed it into &s;afe hands &s;igned and &s;eal|ed. H. Sydney is &s;aid to have made a very ill di&s;cour&s;e to him at the Hague, and if it come before the Parliament, will probably have evil effects. The Duke went towards Scotland on Mon|day, full of various imaginations, as is &s;aid; but &s;ome under&s;tanding men think he hath nothing, that ought more to plea&s;e him in his journey than good weather. There is a paper ca&s;t about the town of the Earl of Danby his ca&s;e, which makes a very ill one of it; and among&s;t other things to prove he was not of the French faction, he &s;ays, he needs alledge only the French Amba&s;&s;ador's di&s;cour&s;es of him at

The Duke his fir&s;t lodging was at Hatfield; the Earl of Sali&s;bury being at Quick&s;hot, &s;ix miles off, &s;ent his &s;on to excu&s;e his not coming to wait upon his Royal Highne&s;s, for that he had been let blood five days before.

No provi&s;ions for his entertainment appeared in the hou&s;e, but two Does upon the table, one barrel of &s;mall beer in the cellar, and a pile of faggots.

The gentlemen of the neighbourhood were &s;o charitable as to take the Lord of O&s;&s;ory and many others to their hou&s;es, where they were well entertained. The Duke being unwilling to be burthen|&s;ome to a poor Lord, appointed Sir J.

<P>On Tue&s;day the 26th, Dangerfield was brought to the bar of the hou&s;e of Commons, where he did declare him|&s;elf po&s;itively, that the Duke had of|fered him a great &s;um of money to kill the King. He al&s;o &s;aid, that the

Sir H. Capell &s;econded him. Sir Francis Winning|ton made a Recapitulation of all that had been done &s;ince the la&s;t Parlia|ment to the prejudice of the nation, in favour of Popery, and imputed the greate&s;t part thereof unto the &s;ame cau&s;e; whereupon a vote was pa&s;&s;ed by the hou&s;e <HI>nemine contradicente,</HI> that the hou&s;e &s;hould proceed ince&s;&s;antly upon the further di&s;covery of the plot, and the means of preventing a Popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="157">
Wedne&s;day the 27th, Dangerfield was brought into the Speaker's cham|ber, and being put to his oath by a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, did depo&s;e what he had formerly &s;aid. Mr. Hide only and Sir Lionel Jenkins did &s;peak in favour of the Duke; and the latter having the ill luck to &s;ay, he did in his heart believe his Royal Highne&s;s was as good a Subject as any is in England, one, that was not far off, whi&s;per'd, "and as good a Prote&s;tant.</P>

had been a conte&s;t between the Duke of York and Coleman; he complain|ing that the Duke put him upon bu|&s;ine&s;&s;es that would bring him to be hanged, the Duke told him, he would &s;ecure his life, &s;o he would hold his peace: Coleman an&s;wered, he could do &s;o for the future; but he had al|ready confe&s;&s;ed &s;o much unto his Friend Sir Edmond Godfrey, that it was in his Power to di&s;cover him and all his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; whereupon the Duke replied, that ought not to trouble him, for order &s;hould be taken to keep Godfrey from doing any hurt, which in a few days was performed by his death.

rate than the <HI>&s;aving of my life.</HI> You having proceeded thus far, I will, with|out any &s;cruple, put my&s;elf intirely upon the <HI>King's word;</HI> and de&s;ire you only to obtain a <HI>Pa&s;s</HI> to &s;ignify it, and that his Maje&s;ty is plea&s;ed to &s;end for me; &s;o as the officers of the ports or other places may not &s;top me, as they will be apt to do as &s;oon as they know my name, if I have not that for my protection. You took that which had pa&s;&s;ed between you and me &s;o rightly, that I have nothing to add unto it. I have no other bu&s;ine&s;s than what &s;olely concerns my per&s;on and family. I de&s;ire not to be a day in England un|known to the King, or his Mini&s;ters; and will lo&s;e no time in waiting upon the Secretary, as &s;oon as I can after my arrival. I think it no ways rea&s;onable

that I &s;hould &s;tay in England, if the King do not &s;ee, I may do it with|out any &s;hadow or po&s;&s;ibility of preju|dice unto him; and unle&s;s I can &s;ati&s;|fy him in that point, I de&s;ire no more than to return on this &s;ide the &s;eas after the three months, where I intend to fini&s;h my days, without thinking any more of living in England. You &s;ee my thoughts &s;imply expo&s;ed; I be&s;eech you to accompli&s;h the work you have &s;o well begun. Send your an&s;wer to Mon&s;ieur du Moulins, and believe no man in the world can be more obliged unto you, than</P>

<P>I HAD not failed of &s;eeing you, when you were here, if it could have been compa&s;&s;ed by indu&s;try, for I was more than once at your old lodg|ing in King-&s;treet, and the new one which I then heard you had taken near St. James's; but Courtiers are always in motion, &s;o as to meet with them is as hard, as to &s;hoot flying, and though my intention was to have done it, I found that &s;kill was wanting. I was in that enquiry guided by my own in|clinations unto you, and the know|ledge of obligations received from you,
<PB N="173" REF="169">
both of which join in per&s;wading me to wi&s;h you in a way more &s;uitable un|to your humour, than that which en|gageth you in trouble&s;ome removes to follow a Prince, who perhaps doth not always know his own mind, or that thinks it a part of his greatne&s;s to vex as many as he can. Tho&s;e that he &s;ent lately hither, &s;pake of nothing &s;o much as <HI>la gloire de leur Maitre;</HI> though perhaps there were more of true glory in the &s;teadine&s;s of a little good common &s;en&s;e, than in all the vanities and whim&s;ies their heads are filled with. But if you find &s;ome inconve|nience in being obliged in a degree to comply with them where you are, I doubt whether you would have been exempted from the like here, for even we that are afar off from that fire, are

<P>THE time that I have remained here beyond my expectation, might have given you lei&s;ure to let me know what &s;ucce&s;s you had in the bu&s;ine&s;s you were plea&s;ed to &s;peak to me of, but the &s;ickne&s;s, which as I hear you fell into &s;oon after your ar|rival, may have detained you, till you had rea&s;on to believe I was removed into a country far from this; but if your recovery give you opportunity of making an e&s;&s;ay, I de&s;ire you either to give your letter, by which I may know it, to my Lady Sunderland, to
