<HEAD>AN AUTHENTIC NARRITIVE Of the Lo&s;s of the DODDINGTON INDIAMAN, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Deddington, Capt. Sam&s;on, failed from the Downs on the 23d. of April, 1755, in Company with the Pelham, the Houghton, the Streatham, and the Edge|court, all in the Service of the Ea&s;t India Company, and in about &s;even Days got clear of the Channel; during this Time C. pt. Sam&s;on perceived that his Ship failed fa&s;ter than any of the others, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e was unwilling to lo&s;e the Advantage of this Superiority by keeping them Company: He therefore &s;tood on alone, and having very &s;oon lo&s;t Sight of them, he made Bonavi&s;ta, one of the Cape de Verde I&s;lands, lat. 16 North, on the 20th of May and on the 21 he got into Porto Prior Bay. It now app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ared either that he had been mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing
<PB N="4" REF="3">
his Ship to out &s;ail the re&s;t of the Fleet, or that he had lo&s;t Time by the Cour&s;e he &s;teered, for he found the Pelham and the Streatham had reached the Bay two Hours before him. The Houghton arrived &s;oon afterwards, but the Edgecourt did not come till the 26th.</P>
<P>On the 27th of May, the Doddington, Pelham, Streath am and Houghton, having taken in their Water, proceeded on the Voyage together, leaving the Edgecourt in the Road: they continued in Company &s;teering S. by E. S E. till the 28th. when Capt. Sam&s;on thinking the Cour&s;e too far ea&s;terly, order|ed the Doddington to be kept South, which again &s;epareted her from the re&s;t of the Fleet, and after a fine Voyage of &s;eve-Weeks &s;he made the Land of the Cape of Good Hope. Hav|ing ju&s;t doubled the Cape, a new Departure was taken from de Agulhas on the 8th of July; and the Ve&s;&s;el having &s;teered Ea&s;tward about 24 Hours, between the Latitude of 35d, 30 m, and 36d. the Captain ordered her to be kept E. N. E.</P>
<P>In this Cour&s;e &s;he continued till about a Quarter before One in the Morning of Thur&s;day, July 17, when &s;he &s;truck: The Officer from who&s;e Journal this Account is taken, was then a|&s;leep in his Cabin, but being &s;uddenly awaked from the Shock, he &s;tarted up in the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation, and made all the ha&s;t he could to get upon Deck; here all the Terrors of his Situa|tion ru&s;hed upon him at once, he &s;aw the Men da&s;hed to and fro by the Violence of the Sea that rolled over them, and the Ship breaking to Pieces at every Stroke of the Surge; he crawled over, with great Difficulty, to the larboard Side of the Quarter-deck, which lay the highe&s;t out of Water, and there he found the Captain, who &s;aid very little more than they mu&s;t all peri&s;h; in a few Minutes a Sea parted them, and he &s;aw him no more. He made &s;hift to get back to the Quarter-deck, but he was very much brui&s;ed, and the &s;mall Bone of his Left Arm was broken; all the re&s;t of the Ship was under Water, and
<PB N="5" REF="4">
&s;hattered to Pieces. In this dreadful Situation, expecting every Moment to be &s;wallowed up he heard &s;omebody cry out Land! Upon this he looked eagerly about him, but tho he &s;aw &s;omething which he &s;uppo&s;ed was taken for Land, he believed it to be only the Range of the Sea on the other Side of the Breakers; at the &s;ame Moment the Sea broke over him with great Violence, and not only forced him from his Hold, but &s;tun|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed him by a violent Blow upon his Eye; tho' from this Time he lay in&s;en&s;ible 'till after Day light, yet he continued upon the Wreck, and when he recovered he found him&s;elf made fa&s;t to a Plank by a Nail that had been forced into his Shoulder; be&s;ides the Pain that he felt from his Wounds and Brui&s;es, he was now &s;o benumbed with Cold, that he could &s;carce move either hand or foot; he called out as loud as he could, and was heard by the People on the Rocks&punc; but they could give him no A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;o that it was a con&s;iderable Time before he could di&s;engage him&s;elf and crawl on Shore.</P>
<P>This Shore was a barren uninhabitod Rock, in the Lat. of 33d. 44. m. South, and di&s;tant about 250 Leagues Ea&s;t of the Cape of Good Hope. Here were now met Mr. Evan Jones, Chief Mate, Mr. Jobn Collet 2d, Mr. William Webb 3d, and Mr. S, Powel 5th Mate; Richard Topping, Carpenter; Neal Bothwell and Nathaniel Chi&s;holm, Quarter Ma&s;ters; Daniel Ladova, the Captain's Steward; Henry Sharp, the Surgeon's Servant; Thomas Arnold, a Black, and John Mackdowal, Ser|vants to the Captain. Robert Bea&s;eley, John King, Gilbert Chain, Terence Mole, Jonas Ro&s;enbury, John Gla&s;s,&mdash;Taylor, and Hendri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> Scantz, Seamen; John Yets, Mid&s;hip|men, and John Li&s;ter, Ralph Smith, and Edward Dy&s;oy, Ma|tro&s;&s;es. The&s;e Per&s;ons being 23 in Number, were all that re|mained of 276 Souls that were on board when the Ship &s;truck.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t Care was to &s;earch among the Things which had been thrown upon the Rocks from the Ship, for &s;omething to
<PB N="6" REF="5">
cover them, in which they &s;ucceeded beyond their Hopes. The next Thing they felt the Want of was Fire, and this was not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;upplied. &s;ome of them attempted to kindle two Piecee of Wood, by rubbing them together, but wirhout Succe&s;s; others went peeping about among the Rocks to pick up fome|thing that might &s;erve for a Flint and Steel; after long Search they &s;ound a Box that contained two Gun Flints. and a broken File; this was a joyful Acqui&s;ition, but &s;till they had nothing that would kindle from a Spark, and till &s;omething like Tinder could be procured, the Flint and Steel were u&s;ele&s;s; a farther Search was therefore undertaken with inexpre&s;&s;ible Sollitude and Anxiety; a Cask of Gunpowder was at la&s;t di&s;covered, but to their great Di&s;appointment it proved to be wet, however, upon a a near Examination, a &s;mall Quantity was &s;ound at the Bottom of the Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">k, which had &s;uffered no Damage; &s;ome of this they brui&s;ed on a Linnen Rag, which &s;erved them very well &s;or Tin|der, and a Fire was &s;oon made; the brui&s;ed and wounded ga|thered about it, and the re&s;t went in Search of other Nece&s;&s;eries, without which the Rock could afford them but a &s;hort Re&s;pite from De&s;truction. In the Afternoon a Box of Wax C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ndles, and a Ca&s;e of Brandy were brought in, both were extremely welcome, e&s;pecially the Brandy, of which every one thought it advi&s;eable to take a Dram; &s;oon after &s;ome others of the Party, returned with an Account that they had di&s;covered a Cask full almo&s;t of fre&s;h Water, which was yet of more Con&s;equence than the Brandy, and Mr. Jones brought in &s;ome Piece of Salt Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">k, and &s;oon after others arrived driving before them &s;even Hogs, which had come on Shore alive; &s;ome Casks of Beer, Water, and Flour, were al&s;o &s;een at a Di&s;tance. But it was not then po&s;&s;ible to get them over the Rocks: the Approach of Night made it nece&s;&s;ary to provide &s;ome Shelter, all Hands therefore were employ'd to make a Tent of &s;ome Canv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s that had been thrown on Shore, which was at la&s;t effected, though it was &s;o &s;mall for want of more Sail Cloth, that it would not hold them all. The I&s;land was much frequented by a kind of Water-f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ul,
<PB N="7" REF="6">
&s;omething larger than a Duck, called a Gannet and the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gh|e&s;t Part of it was covered with their Durg; upon this Part they were obliged to build their Tent, for fear of being overflowed, and they placed tho&s;e who could not walk, under the Tent, and kindled a Fire near them; but as they had pa&s;&s;ed the Day with|out Food, they pa&s;&s;ed the Night without Re&s;t be&s;ides, that they were &s;unk a Foot in the Fowl's Dung, the Night was &s;o tempe&s;tious that the Wind blew away their Fire, and before it could be &s;craped together again, the Rain put it out.</P>
<P>In the Morning, which was Friday July the 18th, tho&s;e that were able went again about the Rock, to &s;ee what could be &s;aved from the Wreck but to their great Mortification, they found all the Casks which they had &s;een the Night before, except one of Beer, and one of Flour, &s;taved to Pieces again&s;t the Rocks; &s;oon after the&s;e were &s;ecured the Tide flowed up and put a Stop to the Work of that Day. The Company therefore was called together to eat their fir&s;t Meal, and &s;ome Ra&s;hers of Pork were broiled upon the Coals for Dinner,</P>
<P>The &s;itting down thus de&s;olare and forlorn, to a Repa&s;t, which they u&s;ed to &s;hare in the convivial Charfulne&s;s, which naturally aro&s;e from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of pre&s;ent Plenty, and the Hope of future, &s;truck them them with &s;uch a Sen&s;e of their Condition, that they bur&s;t into pa&s;&s;ionate Lamentations, wringing their Hands and looking round then with all the Wildn&s;s of De&s;pair; in &s;uch Tumult of Mind, our Thoughts hurry from one Object to another, to fix if po&s;&s;ible, upon &s;omething that may afford Comfort; and one of the Company recollecting, that as the Car|penter was among them they might build a Sloop, if they could procure Materials and Tools, mentioned this as a Subject of Hope to the re&s;t; every Man's Attention was immediately turned upon the Carpenter, who declared that he had no doubt but he &s;hould be able to build a Sloop that would carry them all to &s;ome Port of Safety, if Tools and Materials could be found; at that Time
<PB N="8" REF="7">
indeed, they had no rational Pro&s;pect of procuring either, any more than or being able to vic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">al a Sloop, if they had had one ready built; yet they had no &s;oorer placed their Deliverance oneremove beyond total Imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ibility, than they &s;eemed to think it neither Improbable nor Difficult; they began to eat without farther repining, and from that Moment the Boat engro&s;&s;ed their whole Conver&s;ation, and they not only debated upon the Size and Manner of Rigging her but to what Port they &s;hould &s;teer her, whether the Cape or Delegoa.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had fini&s;hed their Repair, &s;ome went in &s;earch of Tools, and others to mend the Tent, no Tools however were found that Day.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 19. They &s;ecured four Butts of Water, one Cask of Flower, one Hog&s;head of Brandy, and one of their little Boats, which had been thrown up by the Tide, in a &s;hat|tered Condition; but they found no Tools except a Scraper.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, July</HI> 20 They had the good Fortune to find a Hamper, in which there were Files, Sail-needles, Gimblets, and an Azi|muth Compas Card. They al&s;o found two Quadrants, a Car-Penter's Adze, a Chi&s;&s;el, and three Sword-blades, and a Che&s;t of Trea&s;urer This &s;earch was made very early in the Morning, as there had been a prodigious Surf rolling in all the Day before, by which it was rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e &s;omething would be thrown up. At Ten o'Clock they all a&s;&s;embled to Prayers, and did not go out again till after Dinner, when they found mo&s;t of the Packets of Letters belonging to the King, and the Company; the&s;e they carefully dried and laid by.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day, as they were &s;earching about the Beach, they found the Boly of a Gentlewoman, which they knew to be that of Mrs. Collet, the Wife of their &s;econd Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e, who was then of a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> from the Spot. The mutual Affection of this
<PB N="9" REF="8">
Couple was remara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">bly tender, and Mr. Jones, the fir&s;t Mare immediately &s;tepped a&s;ide to Mr Collet, and found means to take him to the other &s;ide of the Rock, while the other two Mates, the Carpenter, and &s;ome others, dug a Grave in the Bird's Dung, in which they depo&s;ited the Body, reading over it the Burial Service, from a French Prayer Book, which had driven a&s;hore with her from the Wreck. Having thus paid the Deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Humanity to the Dead, and concealed from Mr. Collet a Sight which would mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly, if not fatally, have affected him, they found means, after &s;ome Days, to di&s;clo&s;e to him by degrees what they had done, and to give him the Wedding|ring, which they had taken from her Finger. He received it with great Emotion, and afterwards &s;pent many Days, in rai&s;ing a Monument over the Grave, by piling up the &s;quare&s;t S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ones he could find, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">op of which he fixed an E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lank, and in&s;cribed it with her Name, her Age, the Time of her Death, and &s;ome Account a&s; the fatal Accident by which it was oc|ca&s;ioned.</P>
<P>On Monday, July 21, they &s;ecured &s;ome more Water and Pork, and found &s;ome Timber, Plank, Cordage, and Canvas. The&s;e they &s;ecured with great joy for the Boat, though as yet they were in want of many Implements, without which it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Carpenter to work. He had ju&s;t fini&s;hed a Saw, but he had neither Hammer nor Nails. It happened, however, that one of the Seamen, Hendrick Scantz, a Sweed, having picked up an old Pair of Bellows, brought them to his Compani|ons, and told them, that he had been by Profe&s;&s;ion a Smith, and that with the&s;e Bellows and a Forge, which he hoped they would be able, by his Direction, to build, he could furni&s;h the Carpenter with all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ools he would want, Nails included, as plenty of Iron might be obtained by burning the Timber which had come on Shore from the Wreck. This Acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">unt was received with a Tran&s;port of Joy; the Smith immediately ap|plied him&s;elf to mend the Bellows, and the three following Days
<PB N="10" REF="9">
were &s;pent in building a Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t and a Forge, in bringing toge|ther the Timber and Plank for the Carpenter's u&s;e who was al&s;o bu&s;y in getting ready the few Tools he had, that he might Begin the Boat as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day, <HI>July</HI> 24. The Carpenter, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Che&s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m, the Quarter-Ma&s;ter, began to work upon the Keel of the Boat&punc; which they had determined &s;hould be a Sloop, 30 Feet long, and is wide. This Day al&s;o the Smith fini&s;hed his Forge, and laid in a Quan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ty of Fir for F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">wel, From this Time the Carpenter and Smith contineed to work with indefatigable Illigence, except when they were prevented by the Weather; the Smith having furtunately found the Ring and not of a Power Anchor; which &s;erved him for an Anvil, &s;upply'd Che&s;|&s;els, Axes, Hammers, Nails, as they wanted, and the Car|penter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">fed them with great Dexterity and Di&s;patch, till the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> when he fell &s;ick.</P>

<P>In the mean Time the Stores which they had &s;aved from the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eck were &s;o near exhau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ted, that they came to an Allowance of two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of Brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Man per Day, and had no &s;al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Pork, except wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t they were determined to keep to victual their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Water al&s;o fell &s;hort.

This gave them fre&s;h hope, and every one was ready to venture out for the deliverance of their Friends. The Carpenter di&s;patched the Boat in about a Quarter of an Hour, and &s;he &s;oon overtook the Float, and took Collet and Yets on Board. They &s;oon found, however, that the Water gained very &s;a&s;t upon them; notwith&s;tanding their utmo&s;t Efforts, and when &s;he came in, &s;he was &s;o full of Water, that in a few Minutes &s;he mu&s;t have &s;unk.</P>

At Moon they became very unea&s;y at having &s;een nothing of her; but ju&s;t as they were &s;itting down to Dinner, they were agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed by two of their People, who came running over the Rocks crying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ut <HI>the Boat! the Boat!</HI> They all &s;tarted up overjoyed at the Sound, and ran to &s;ee her come in, with great Hopes that &s;he had &s;ucceded; but they &s;oon di&s;tingu&s;hed, that &s;he was rowed only by one Man, who plied both Oars: They concluded, therefore, that the other two were lo&s;t or detained; but pre&s;ently they &s;aw another get up from the Boottom of the Boat, where it was &s;uppo&s;ed he had lain down for &s;ome &s;hort Refre&s;hment, and then the Boat came forward &s;omewhat fa&s;ter, though &s;till at a &s;low Rate. The Dinner was now entirely forgot, and after they had waited an Hour on the Beach with the ut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;t Impatience, the Boat came in. The two Men were Ro&s;enbury and Taylor, who, the Moment they &s;tept on Shore, threw them&s;elves on their Knees, and in a &s;hort but earne&s;t Ejaculation returned Thanks to God for having once more &s;et them &s;afe upon this Place, which barren and de&s;olate as it was, they now con&s;idered as an A&s;ylum from a Situation of much greater Di&s;tre&s;s. Having exerted their utmo&s;t Effort to bring the Boat in, their Strength foreook them at once, and they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> not able to ri&s;e from the Ground without A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t over to the Tent, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the re&s;t, every Body was bu|&s;y to procure them &s;ome Refre&s;hment, for they found that the Boat was quite bare of provi&s;ions

and Water. They dre&s;&s;ed them &s;ome Fi&s;h, with as much ha&s;te as they could, and perceiveing that they were quite exhau&s;ted with Watching and Labour, they left them when they had eat|en their Meat, without asking any Que&s;tions, and they immediately fell a&s;leep. The Behaviour of the&s;e hone&s;t Sailors to their Me&s;s-mates, was an uncommon In&s;tance of hearty Kindne&s;s, and generous Self-denial; the Impatience of their Curio&s;ity mu&s;t have been both encrea&s;ed and ju&s;ti|fied in Proportion, as they were intere&s;ted in the Account that was to gratify it; yet even this Cu|rio&s;ity, in which Life it&s;elf was concerned, they had the kindne&s;s and the Fortitude to repre&s;s, rather than delay the Refre&s;hment of others for its Gratification.</P>
<P>The Account which was given by the two Ad|venturers when they awoke was to this Effect:</P>
<P>About three o'Clock on the Day they &s;et out, they got round a Point, about &s;ix Leagues Ea&s;t of the Rock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, as they approached, it had the App<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">arance of a double Point, which encouraged them to hope, that between the two Points they &s;hould find&punc; Harbour; but in this hope they were dia&s;ppointed, for they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ound a large Surf all along the Coa&s;t. However, about Fiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> o'Clock, having &s;een only one of the Natives, they ven|tured
<PB N="15" REF="14">
to pull in for Shore, but the Moment they got into the Surf, the Boat over&s;et. By this Accident <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Bothwell was drowned, and the other two, who reached the Shore in an exhau|&s;ted and &s;eeble Condition, were left de&s;titute of every kind of Provi&s;ion, except a &s;mall Keg of Brandy, As &s;oon as they had a little recovered their Strength, they crawled along the Shore to &s;eek for the Boat, having no other hope of &s;helter from the wild Bea&s;ts, which might be expected to come abroad in the Night. After &s;ome Search they found her, but they were too weak to get her up, and Darkne&s;s coming on, they were o|bliged to lie down upon the Sand, with no other Covering than the Branches of a Tree, and in this Condition they pa&s;&s;ed the Night. As &s;oon as the Morning dawned, they went again to look for the Boat, which the Surf had driven from where they left her. As they walked along the Coa&s;t they &s;aw a Man and advanced towards him, upon which he ran away into the Woods that lay near the Beach, and were very thick. They went on, and &s;oon after di&s;covered the Bo|dy of their Companion, Bothwell, which had been dragged up the &s;and a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the Water, and to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n to Pieces by &s;ome wild Bea&s;t. This terified them exceedingly, and ha|ving found the Beat, the dread of pa&s;&s;ing ano|ther Night on Shore; detirmined them immedi|ately to return. They were, however, prevented

in the Attempt by a Fre&s;h Gale at We&s;t, and before they could put back, the Boat over&s;et with them a Second time, and drove with them along Shore. After much &s;truggleing and Swimming they got once more &s;afe on the Land; but as they had now been fa&s;ting ever &s;ince Three o'Clock the Day before, they were fainting with Hunger and Fateigue. It happened, however, that they met with a Fruit re&s;embleing an Apple, which they eagerly gathered and eat, without knowing either its name or its Quality. By good forune, it did them no harm; and being &s;omewat refre&s;hed by their antidiluvian Repa&s;t, they made &s;hift to haul the Boat on Shore, and turning it up&s;ide down, they crept under it to &s;leep, being thus very well &s;heltered from the Sun, and &s;ecured again&s;t the wild Bea&s;ts. Tho&s;e who know the irre&s;i&s;table Power of Sleep, after long Watching and exce&s;|&s;ive Labour, will not conclude that their fir&s;t Slumber was &s;hort, becau&s;e their &s;ituation was incommodious or in&s;ecure; they waked, however, before the next Morning, and peeping under the Edge of the Boat, they could di&s;cern the Feet of &s;everal Creatures, which by their Claws they &s;uppo&s;ed to be Tygers, pa&s;s by them to and a|gain. This was a &s;ufficient Motive to remian in their re&s;ting Place till the Morning, when they looked out again, and &s;aw the Feet of a Man. Upon this Di&s;covery they came from under the Boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, to the great A&s;toni&s;hment of the poor
<PB N="17" REF="16">
Savage, and two other Men and a Boy, who were at &s;ome Di&s;tance. When they had got all together, and were a little recovered from their Surprize, they made Signs to the Sailors to go a|way, which they endeavoured to do, though they were able to move but very &s;lowley</P>
<P><HI>Before they had gone far from the Boat, a con&s;ide|rable Number of the Natives ran down upon them with their Lances. It happened that Ro&s;enbury had picked up the Ma&s;t of the Boat, and a Pi&s;tol which had been wa&s;hed on Shore, as he went along; being thus armed, when the Indians came down upon him, and being be&s;ides unable to run, he imprudently turn|ed about, and exerting all his Strength, advanced to|wards them in a threatening Manner, &s;uppo&s;ing that they would have been &s;eized with a Panic, and re|treated into the Woods.</HI></P>
<P>It happended, however, that he was mi&s;taken; for in&s;tead of running away, they &s;urrounded him, and began to whet their Lances. Taylor thought it was now Time to try what could be done by Supplication; he therefore threw him&s;elf on his Knees, and in a piteous Tone cried out for Mercy; but Ro&s;enberry took Refuge in the Water. The Savages immediately came up to Taylor, and began to &s;trip him: he &s;uffered them quierly to take his Shoes and his Shirt, but when they attacked his Trow&s;ers he made &s;ome Re&s;i&s;t|&s;tance,
<PB N="18" REF="17">
and by his Ge&s;tures, intreated they would not leave him quite naked, upon which they thought fit to de&s;i&s;t. They then made Sings for Ro&s;enberry to come to them, who was all this while &s;wimming about in the Sea; but he refu&s;ed, and made Signs that they would kill him. They then pointed to Taylor, intimating that they had not killed him: Upon this he came forward, and having fir&s;t thrown them his Pi&s;tol, and all his Cloaths but his Shirt, he ventured to put him|&s;elf into their Hands, When he came up they offered him no Violence, only held the Boat's Ma&s;t and the Pi&s;tol to him, by Way of deriding the Folly of his Attempt to fright them. They &s;eemed to be very much plea&s;ed with the Cloathes, which they divided among them as far as they would go. They then began to rifle the Boat, and having taken all the Rope they could find, and the Hook by which the Rudder hung to the Stern-po&s;t, they began to knock the &s;tern to peices, for the Iron which they &s;aw was about it. Next to knocking the poor Wretches on the Head, this was the wor&s;t Thing they could do, and, rough as they were, they bur&s;t into Tears at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">njury that was offered to their Boat, and intrea|ted the Savages to de&s;i&s;t, with &s;uch Agony of Di|&s;tre&s;s, that they &s;uffered the Boat to remain as they found it. Encouraged by this Appearance of Placability and Kindne&s;s, and urged by Hun|ger, they asked by Sings, for &s;omething to eat,
<PB N="19" REF="18">
this Reque&s;t was al&s;o granted, and having given them &s;ome Roots, they again made Signs for them to depart; upon which they once more launched their Boat, and go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> into it, but the Wind blowing &s;trong from the We&s;t, they could not put off. The Natives perceiving that they were willing to comply with their De&s;ires, but not able, covered them with the Boat to &s;leep un|der, and left them as they had &s;ound them. The next Morning, the Weather being fine, and the Wind ea&s;terly, they launched the Boat a third Time, and returned back to the Rock.</P>
<P><HI>From this Time till</HI> Sunday <HI>the 29th of</HI> Septem|ber, <HI>the Carpenter and Smith continued to work upon the Boat, and the People were bu&s;y in getting in from Time to Time what was thrown up from the Wreck, particularly Cordage and Canvas, to rig the Boat, and &s;ome Casks of fre&s;h Water, which they were very &s;olicitous to keep for Sea Stores, as their E&s;cape in the Boat &s;carce depended le&s;s upon fre&s;h Water than upon the Sails them&s;elves. On this Day, after they had been at Prayers, a Duty which was regularly and pu|blickly performed every Sunday, the Officers di&s;cover|ed that the Che&s;t of Trea&s;ure had been broke open, and the greater Part of it taken away and concealed. It may perhaps be thought &s;trange, that People, whom Danger had made religious, &s;hould at the &s;ame Time be guilty of Theft; but, upon this Occa&s;ion, it &s;hould be remembred, that as &s;oon as a Ship is lo&s;t, the Sai|lors

lo&s;e their Pay, and the Captain his Command; every Di&s;tinction and Subordination that &s;ub&s;ifled on Ship-board is at an End; and whatever is ca&s;t a&s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e from the Wreck is, by the Sailors, con&s;idered as com|mon Property. The Men, therefore, who thought fit &s;ecretly to take what they deemed their Share of this Trea&s;ure, were not, in their own Opinion, guilty of Di&s;hone&s;ty, but intended only to &s;ecure what they feared the Officers would monopolize, and by this Means prevent Di&s;putes, which, in their Circum|&s;tances, might produce fatal Effects. The Officers, however, when they di&s;covered what had been done, and found that nodody would own they knew any Thing a|bout it, propo&s;ed to write the Form of an Oath, and admini&s;ter it &s;eparately to every Individual, the Officers to take it fir&s;t. But to this the Majority immediately objected; for tho' they might not &s;uppo&s;e they had committed a Crime by taking the Trea&s;ure, they knew it would be not only immoral, but impious, to &s;wear they had not taken it. As the Minority were not in a Condition to &s;upport their Motion, the Affair was &s;uffered to re&s;t, without farther Enquiry or Re|mon&s;trance.</HI></P>
<P>On the 6th of October they found a Fowling|piece; this was a joyful Acqui&s;ition, and though the Barrel was much bent, it was &s;oon made &s;er|viceable by the Carpenter, and u&s;ed with great Succe&s;s in &s;hooting the Birds, which before they had no way of taking, but by knocking them down with a Stick.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
<HI>On Friday October</HI> II. <HI>they perceived the Gannets, which had of late for&s;aken them, to hover again about the Rock in great Numbers, and were in hopes they would &s;ettle to lay their Eggs, in which, to their great Joy, they were not di&s;appointed; for after this Time they were con&s;tantly &s;upplied with Eggs in great Plenty, till the beginning of January, when the Sea|&s;on of laying was pa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>On Sunday October 20. Mr. Collet, Mr. Web, and two others, ventured out once more on the Float, but the Wind &s;pringing up very fre&s;h, the Float broke loo&s;e, and drove with them to the other &s;ide of the Rocks. The Wind &s;till ri&s;ing, and the Sea running very high, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Boat to put out; they were therefore obli|ged to remain all Night among the Seals on the Rocks, without any Shelter or Refre&s;hment. But in this Situation, how dreadful, they received great Comfort from reflecting how much more dreadful it would have been, if in&s;tead of being driven to the Rocks, their Float had been carried out to Sea. It was Noon, the next Day before the Wind abated, and then the Boat ventured off; but as the Waves &s;till ran high, it could bring in no more than two at a time, leaving the Float be|hind them. They had now &s;ome rainy Weather, which proved very acceptable, as they contrived to &s;ave &s;ome of the Water for Sea Stores; but they were &s;till in great want of Bread, having lived
<PB N="22" REF="21">
many Days on &s;hort Allowance. As a la&s;t Re|&s;ource, they thought of building an Oven, for they had &s;ome Burrels of Flower, though they had no Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d: In this Attempt they &s;ucceeded, beyond their Expectations, and were able to con|vert their Flower into tolerable Bi&s;cuit.</P>
<P><HI>This Bi&s;cuit, however, was at length &s;o mar ex|tended, that they were obliged to live upon a few Ounces a Day, without Brandy, of which only a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">amll Quantity remained, and this they pre&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ved in|available for the U&s;e of the Carpenter. They were al&s;o &s;o &s;hort of Water, that of this they were allowed but Half a Pint a Day.</HI></P>
<P>In this Condition, however, they happily in a great Degree pre&s;erved their Health and Vigour, and on the 16th of February they launched their Boat, and called her the <HI>Happy Deliverance.</HI> On the 17th they got their little Pittance of Stores on Board, and on the 18th they &s;et &s;ail from the Rock, on which they had lived ju&s;t &s;even Months, and to which at parting they gave the Name of <HI>Birds I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>When they embarked in their boat, the <HI>Happy Deliverance,</HI> at <HI>Berd I&s;land,</HI> they were two and twenty in number, and had on board two buts and four hog&s;heads of water, two of the hogs that had come on &s;hore from the &s;hip alive, one firkin of
<PB N="23" REF="22">
butter, about 90 ponnd of bi&s;cuit, and about ten ten days &s;alt provi&s;ions, at two ounces a man per day, but this was quite rotten and decayed.</P>
<P>The joy which they felt at putting off from this dreadful &s;eat of &s;amine and de&s;olation was too great to be expre&s;&s;ed; but it was of very &s;hort con|tinuance, for as &s;oon as they got to the mouth of the little channel which led to the rock, the grap|nails came home, and they were in&s;tantly driven on the rocks where their boat, which had co&s;t &s;even months ince&s;&s;ant labour, and was the found|ation of all their hopes, &s;truck &s;o often and with &s;uch violence, that they were thrown into the ut|mo&s;t con&s;ternation, and expected every moment &s;he would be broken to pieces. It was a great aggra|vation of their di&s;tre&s;s, that no efforts of their own could at all contribute to extricate or relive them, &s;o that they could only gaze at each other, and wait, helple&s;s and inactive, for the moment of De&s;truction. In this condition, however, it plea&s;ed him whom the winds and waves obey, to relieve them; a &s;well of the &s;ea took the boat &s;o favour|ably, that it lifted her from the rock on which &s;he was beating, and carrying over her the bar, left her in four fath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m calm water. Here they immedately anchored, to repair their damage by &s;ecuring the grapnails, and this was not effectually done till noon the next day.</P>
<P>On the 18th of February, at about one in the
<PB N="24" REF="23">
afternoon, they weighed and &s;tood to the ea&s;tward, in order to make the river St. Lucia, on the coa&s;t of Africa, about 300 leagues to the north-ea&s;t of the Cape, their fir&s;t port. In this attempt they per&s;i&s;ted till the &s;econd of March, being no le&s;s than twelve days and nights, without getting one mile on their cour&s;e; for the currents, by which their &s;hip had been driven out of her way, and which not being allowed for, had produced a fa|tal error in their reckoning, now run &s;o &s;trong to the we&s;tward, that a fair wind, in&s;tead of carrying them forward, &s;carce enabled them to keep their ground. In the mean time, their provi&s;ions was very near exhau&s;ted, and being at once expo&s;ed both to &s;hipwreck and famine, they determined to deliver them&s;elves up to the cour&s;e of the current, which they had endeavoured in vain to &s;tem, and &s;o get back to the Cape.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd of March, therefore, they bore away to the we&s;tward, but the very next day the wind, which, till then had been ea&s;terly, blew a &s;trong gale from the we&s;t, &s;o that the wind now counteracted the force of the current, and continuing to ri&s;e all that day and the following night, the next morning, Thur&s;day, March 4, it it blew a &s;trom. They now endeavoured to lie too, but they &s;hipped &s;uch heavy &s;eas, that they were in perpetual danger of being da&s;hed to pieces, and were therefore compelled to &s;end away under
<PB N="25" REF="24">
their top&s;ail only. They were thus driven before the tempe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">, at a great rate, till the next morning about three o'clock, and then the weather became fine.</P>
<P>This cour&s;e they continued till Wedne&s;day, March the 10th, when the wind &s;hifting to the ea&s;tward, they anchored in twelve fathom water, at the di&s;tance of about half a mile from the &s;hore. In the evening many of the natives came down to the water-&s;ide, hallowing and making &s;igns that they &s;hould land, which they many times attempt|ed, but found it impracticable. In the morning the natives appeared again, repeating their &s;ignals, and driving down great numbers of cattle, but the poor wretches on board were &s;till tantalized by the &s;ight of plenty, which they could not reach, for no place to land could yet be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ound.</P>
<P>&mdash;On Monday the 15th of March, they determined, at all events, to make an at|tempt to get the &s;loop into river; having waited therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> it was high water, they &s;ent the lit|tle boat to &s;ound ahead, and following her at a proper di&s;tance, they at length ventured over the bar, and having happily received no damage, they anchored in two fathom and a half of water.</P>
<P><HI>The natives had now come again to the &s;hore, and the people on board got together &s;ome bra&s;s. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uttons</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="25">
<HI>&s;mall bits of iron, nails, and copper hoops, as the mo&s;t likely commodities to exchange for mutton and beef. The copper hoops they bent into bracelets, to be worn on the legs and arms, &s;uch as are worn by all the na|tives of this coa&s;t who have trafficked with Europeans, and are called Bangles With the&s;e baubles, which are prized by the&s;e poor &s;avages, prehaps with as much rea&s;on as gems and gold are prized by tho&s;e who hold their &s;implicity in contempt, the poor fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;hed adven|turers ha&s;tened on &s;hore; and having &s;oon made the na|tives under&s;tand what they wanted, and what return they would make, two nll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cks, each weighing about</HI> 600 <HI>lb. weight, were driven down to the beach with great expedition, and bartered for about one pound weight of copder hooks and four bra&s;s buttons. Pro|vi&s;ions of all kinds were procured in great plenty at the &s;ame rate, particularly milk, and a &s;mall grain that re&s;embled Guinea wheat. This grain they attempted to bake into into bi&s;cuit for &s;ea &s;tores, but could not &s;ucceed; however they found an excellent expedient, by boiling it wich their meat, which an&s;wered the &s;ame purpo&s;e as bread, and made very good food.</HI></P>
<P>They continued on &s;hore at this place near a fortnight, and found the natives an hone&s;t, open, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mle&s;s, and friendly people, ready to do any kind office that in their power, and always divi|ding what they brought from the cha&s;e, tho' it was ever &s;o little, as far as it would go, with looks and ge&s;tures that &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed that
<PB N="27" REF="26">
plea&s;ure which no &s;elfi&s;h gratification can produce. Their manner of living and appearance were the &s;ame that have been &s;o often de&s;cribed by tho&s;e who have accounts of the people called Hotten|tots, who inhabit the Cape of Good Hope, except that as the&s;e had not been u&s;ed to any commerce with Europeans, they were more innocent, bene|volent, and &s;incere. It is, however, remarkable, that among the&s;e people, who are all black, and woolly haired, there was a youth of about 12 or 14 years, who was quite white, and had regular European features, with fine light hair. The people of the &s;loop ob&s;erved, that he was treated as a &s;ervant, being &s;ent on errands, and &s;ometimes not permitted to eat till the re&s;t had done. They al&s;o took notice, that he di&s;appeared a few days before they left the coa&s;t, and therefore they &s;u&s;|pected the natives were afraid they &s;hould carry him off with them, nor was one of the natives them&s;elves to be &s;een the morning they went a|way.</P>
<P><HI>On Monday, March</HI> 29, <HI>having laid in great plenty of provi&s;ions, they got &s;afe over the bar, and made &s;ail for the river St. Lucia, where they arrived on Tue&s;day the 6th of April, having found the cur|rent more favourable than before, and no other occur|rence having happened that was worth relating.</HI></P>
<P>Having got into the river, and anchored in three
<PB N="28" REF="27">
fathom water, they went on &s;hore, but they found the people very different from tho&s;e with whom they la&s;t traded. When the bra&s;s buttons and bits of old iron were offered them, they refu&s;ed them, and taking up &s;ome of the &s;and from the beach, they poured it out of one hand into the other, by which they might perhaps intend to intimate, that they wanted &s;trong lipuors, tho' the &s;loop's people did not under&s;tand it; and, if they had, thep had no &s;trong liquors for them. They made &s;igns al&s;o, that they wanted &s;ome bra&s;s rings, big enough to &s;erve as collars; but in this too their vi&s;itants were equally unable to gratify them.</P>
<P><HI>Among other things, howiver, which they offered to barter, was a bra&s;s handle of a che&s;t, and a peice of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> they had made eh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ir colours of.

<P>The natives of this part of the coa&s;t, by their frepuent dealings with Europeans, had learned to be cleanly in their per&s;ons and food, dre&s;&s;ing their hair up very neatly, and laying a&s;ide the grea&s;e and garbage, with which the others anoint|ed and adorned them&s;elves; but at the &s;ame time they had learnt to be proud, crafty, deceitful,

and di&s;hone&s;t. However, the adventures &s;tayed with them till Sunday the 18th of April, and then getting all on board, they weighed and made &s;ail.</P>
<P><HI>Hitherto they had been united by adver&s;ity in the bond of friend&s;hip; but as they had now a near pro&s;|hect of deliverance, their minds were le&s;s tender, and their different peculiarities of temper and opinion were indulged with le&s;s re&s;traint. As they were &s;ailing down the river, a di&s;pute aro&s;e about the time and manner of cro&s;&s;ing the bar, which was then very near, and it was carried &s;o high, that &s;ome of them hawled down the &s;ails, and lel go the grapnail clo&s;e to the brake of a &s;and; nine of them then hoi&s;ted out the little boat, and went on &s;hore, &s;wearing that they would &s;ooner take their chance of getting to De la Goa by land, than be drowned in attempting to get over the bar. Tho&s;e who remained in the &s;loop were by this accident reduced to very great di&s;tre&s;s; for being prevented by the delay they had &s;uffered, from getting over the bar at high water, and the wind and tide both &s;etting out of the river at a great rate, they were very &s;oon forced on the breakers, where there was then but</HI> 8 <HI>foot of wa|ter, and the ve&s;&s;el drawing 5, &s;he mu&s;t inevitably have been grounded and beaten to pieces, before the river was half empty.</HI></P>
<P>It happened, however, contrary to all expecta|tion, and from &s;ome unknown cau&s;e, that in le&s;s

than half an hour the &s;urface of the water became &s;mooth, and, by the vigorous efforts of tho&s;e on board, the ve&s;&s;el was brought &s;afely out of the river.</P>
<P><HI>From St. Luciaw, hich by their reckoning is in lati|tude</HI> 28. 14. <HI>&s;outh, and longitude from London</HI> 30. 15. <HI>they took a new departure, and anchored in de la Goa road at</HI> 4 <HI>o'clock in the afternoon on Wedne&s;day the</HI> 2 <HI>of April, having again narrowly e&s;caped &s;hip|wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ck on &s;ome breakers the night before.</HI></P>
<P>Here they found the Ro&s;e galley, Captain Chandler, trading for beef and ivory, and mo&s;t of them begged a pa&s;&s;age with him to Bombay.</P>
<P><HI>After they had contunied here about three weeks three of the nine men who had de&s;erted them at St. Lu|cia, were brought up the river in a &s;mall boat of the country, and reported, that the other &s;ix were wait|ing, without any covering but a &s;hirt and of drawers, onthe other &s;ide of the bay of Delagoa, waiting for a boat to bring them over.</HI></P>
<P>On board the &s;loop there was, among other things, the remainder of the che&s;t of trea&s;ure be|longing to the Ea&s;t-India company, when had been b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oke open upon the rock, and plundered of what the &s;ailors thought their &s;hare of it, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that on the lo&s;s of the &s;hip, it was be|come

common proprity. The officers who had &s;ecured the remainder for the company, and who, till now, had no means of recovering the re&s;t, told Capt. Chandler what had happened, and having con&s;ulted with him what to do, they enticed four or five of tho&s;e who were on board the &s;loop, on &s;hore, and two others on board the Ro&s;e galley: they then took Captain Chandler's pinnace, well manned and armed, and went on board their &s;loop, where they &s;ecured all the money, plate, and packets they could find, without o&s;&s;erin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">g any violence to the people on board or expre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t re&s;entment or menice concerning the emcez|zlement. The people, however, whom they left on board the &s;loop, fearing that they might be taken into cu&s;topy, weighed anchor, and went away in the night.</P>
<P><HI>On the 25th of May the officers and the re&s;t of the crew, being on board the Ro&s;e galley, &s;he weighed an|chor, and proceeded not to Bombay, as was intend|ed, but to Madaga&s;car, this voyage having become nece&s;&s;ary to compleat her cargo, beoau&s;e the natives of Delagoa having &s;old Capt. Chandler</HI> 100 <HI>bead of cattle, &s;tole them all away again afterward, and re|fu&s;ea to re&s;tore them without a new-con&s;ideratiou.</HI></P>
<P>The Ro&s;e galley, &s;oon after &s;he was at &s;ea, made a &s;ail, which, when they came up with, proved to be the &s;loop, which had taken in the

other &s;ix men, that were le&s;t behind at St. Lucia; they had been taken on board alive, but three of them were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> dead, and two more died the next day, having, after their lives had been &s;o often pre&s;erved, almo&s;t to a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ooli&s;hly &s;acrified them to voluntary hard&s;hip and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">igne, in a fit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> unrea&s;onable per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ance and cau&s;ele&s;s di&s;gu&s;t.

Chandler for 2500 repees, which is nearly equal to 5001, &s;terling money. From this time the &s;loop pur&s;ued her voyage in company with the galley and both arrived at Madaga&s;car after a plea&s;ant voyago of two and twenty days.</P>
<P>Soon after they had anchored at Madaga&s;car, they had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee the Carnarvan, Capt. Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">chin&s;on, arrived there, in his voyage from London to China, and as the trea&s;ure and packets, which had been pre&s;erved from the Doddington, were to be delivered at Madras, the officers went with them on board the Carnarvan, and delivered them, with other private effects, to the company's agents there, on the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1756.</P>
