<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By a FRIEND.</BYLINE>
<P><HI>_PLUTARCH,</HI> that ju&s;tly admired philo&s;opher, who has greatly ob|liged the world by his writings, and, among&s;t the&s;e, by the many curious <HI>Apophthegms</HI> he has given us of the wi&s;e and good men of antiquity, tells us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Socrates, meeting one day with Menon, whom he con&s;idered as a man well exerci&s;ed in all the varieties of conver&s;a|tion, as well as a great proficient in &s;pecu|lative wi&s;dom, a&s;k'd him, WHAT IS VIR|TUE? And that Menon an&s;wer'd, There were proper virtues for Youth and Old-age,
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
for Man and Woman, for Magi&s;trate and Private per&s;on, for Ma&s;ter and Servant. An an&s;wer, which (the writer &s;ays) excited the admiration and applau&s;e of Socrates."</Q></P>
<P>But, what would this wi&s;e heathen have &s;aid, and how much greater would have been his tran&s;port, had his friend Menon, by way of an&s;wer, pre&s;ented him with writings, in which he had entered minutely into <HI>the nature of the Virtues</HI> proper for &s;uch different <HI>Ages, Sexes,</HI> and <HI>Stations;</HI> had he de&s;cribed the&s;e &s;ocial ex|cellencies, &s;o <HI>affectingly,</HI> as to command atten|tion, &s;o <HI>accurately,</HI> as to prevent mi&s;take, and &s;o <HI>invitingly,</HI> as to engage imitation!</P>
<P>But a delineation of moral Virtue, like this, was beyond the powers of human <HI>Rea|&s;on,</HI> and the utmo&s;t efforts of antient <HI>Philo&s;o|phy.</HI> And it is to REVELATION (that <HI>greater light</HI> to rule the moral world) that we owe the more perfect knowledge, not only of <HI>Religion,</HI> in matters relative to GOD, but of <HI>Virtue</HI> al&s;o, in matters relative to <HI>our&s;elves, and one another.</HI> No wonder, therefore, that what Menon only mentioned in the general, and what even So|crates could not have de&s;cribed ju&s;tly in the particulars, &s;hould have been executed in the&s;e
<PB N="v" REF="4">
latter times, with greater clearne&s;s and pre|ci&s;ion.</P>
<P>And yet, whatever improvements have been made by Chri&s;tians in the &s;y&s;tem of Moral Duty; how powerfully &s;oever men are now exhorted to act like <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> be|ings; how &s;trongly &s;oever tho&s;e exhortations are enforced by the &s;urer and more animating &s;anctions of the Go&s;pel; yet&mdash;is it not too vi&s;ible, that immorality and irreligion &s;till ob|tain in the lives of <HI>many,</HI> and, perhaps, (dread|ful thought!) of the <HI>majority?</HI> And &s;hall not every man, who is convinced of the real im|portance of virtuous principles and practices, and of the very frequent apo&s;ta&s;y from them, &s;tand forth, and prevent, as far as in him lies, this alarming degeneracy from growing more prevalent?</P>
<P>Many (it is acknowledged, with plea&s;ure and with gratitude) have been the laudable at|tempts of writers, in our own country, to ob|tain this end; and the&s;e both from the <HI>clergy</HI> and <HI>laity.</HI> And a valuable acce&s;&s;ion has been made, within the la&s;t fourteen years, by an author mode&s;tly <HI>anonymous,</HI> in his Three Works called, PAMELA, CLARISSA, and
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
Sir CHARLES GRANDISON! Works, which amiably illu&s;trate, and &s;trongly enforce, the proper Virtues of <HI>Man and Woman, Parent and Child, Old-age and Youth, Ma&s;ter and Ser|vant!</HI> Each of them commuicated in <HI>a re|gular collection of Familiar Letters,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"written to the moment, while the heart is agi|tated by hopes and fears, on events un|decided."</Q> A method which mu&s;t engage more &s;trongly, and prove far more intere&s;t|ing to, the reader, than a cold, unanimating narrative of events long &s;ince determined.</P>
<P>With &s;uch a knowledge of life and manners, as is di&s;played in tho&s;e Works; with a capa|city to entertain with wit, and enliven with humour, as well as to correct with delicacy, and exhort with dignity; we cannot but greatly re&s;pect the man, who, in an age <HI>like this,</HI> has attempted to &s;teal upon the world <HI>reformation,</HI> under the notion of <HI>amu&s;ement;</HI> who has found the expedient of engaging the <HI>private attention</HI> of tho&s;e, who put them&s;elves out of the reach of <HI>public exhortation;</HI> pur|&s;uing to their <HI>clo&s;ets</HI> tho&s;e who fly from the <HI>pulpit;</HI> and there, under the gay air, and captivating &s;emblance of a <HI>Novel,</HI> tempting
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
them to the peru&s;al of many a per&s;ua&s;ive <HI>Sermon.</HI></P>
<P>In order to render the&s;e Letters more com|pletely u&s;eful, in this volume are collected their various important <HI>Maxims,</HI> dige&s;ted un|der their general heads; with <HI>references</HI> from each Maxim to its proper volume and page. A work this, that has not been more pro|ductive of trouble, than (I pre&s;ume) it will be of entertainment and advantage.</P>
<P><HI>Sententious Maxims</HI> and <HI>Moral Aphori&s;ms,</HI> col|lecting into a point, and conci&s;ely, but &s;trongly, expre&s;&s;ing <HI>elevated thoughts, beautiful &s;enti|ments,</HI> or <HI>in&s;tructive le&s;&s;ons,</HI> have always been well received by the public. They have been con&s;idered as the fir&s;t &s;trokes of a picture, in which are &s;een the ju&s;tne&s;s and beauty of the painter's de&s;ign, though it has not the co|louring.</P>
<P>The <HI>maxims of &s;tate,</HI> for in&s;tance, drawn up by Lord HALIFAX, have been greatly e&s;teemed; as being the re&s;ult of long expe|rience, and &s;ound policy. And the <HI>maxims</HI> of ROCHEFOUCAULT have met with a reception perhaps too favourable; as their tendency
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
&s;eems to be, to <HI>di&s;grace human nature,</HI> and <HI>de|&s;troy all the virtues.</HI> And indeed the tran&s;lator of them &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have not read any thing in this age, that has given me a greater <HI>contempt</HI> for man."</Q></P>
<P>The very rever&s;e of this, is the plan on which the following Maxims are grounded; namely, on <HI>the real</HI> dignity <HI>of human nature,</HI> in order to animate man to act up to his genuine greatne&s;s. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It exhibits man, as he really is; a compound, probationary be|ing: fallen indeed from the primitive <HI>per|fection</HI> of his nature, yet &s;till great and amiable in the <HI>&s;incerity</HI> of his virtues: fre|quently rebelling again&s;t the &s;acred laws of rea&s;on and revelation, and then always an enemy to his own happine&s;s, and the peace of &s;ociety: But &s;ometimes &s;o worthily im|proving the graces and the gifts of heaven, as to &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ing of others, and the applau&s;e of his own mind; and advancing, within his proper &s;phere of action, the &s;al|vation of him&s;elf and his fellow-creatures, by a life exemplary in all the duties of a Man and of a Chri&s;tian!"</Q></P>
<P>Such is the great plan, &s;uch the benevolent
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
&s;cheme, of tho&s;e three collections of <HI>Familiar Letters;</HI> which have been already tran&s;lated into &s;everal foreign languages, and received in our own country with uncommon favour. But as the <HI>narrative</HI> part of tho&s;e Letters was only meant as a vehicle for the <HI>in&s;tructive,</HI> no wonder that many readers, who are de&s;irous of fixing in their minds tho&s;e maxims which de|&s;erve notice di&s;tinct from the &s;tory that fir&s;t introduced them, &s;hould have often wi&s;hed and pre&s;&s;ed to &s;ee them &s;eparate from that chain of engaging incidents that will &s;ometimes &s;teal the mo&s;t fixed attention from its pur&s;uit of &s;erious truth.</P>
<P>For the u&s;e therefore of all &s;uch as are de&s;irous of <HI>repeatedly inculcating</HI> on their own minds, and the minds of others, the import|ant <HI>Maxims,</HI> which tho&s;e three works con|tain; and who would <HI>refer</HI> them&s;elves oc|ca&s;ionally to the volumes for the illu&s;tration of the&s;e maxims; this <HI>General Index</HI> both of <HI>Maxims</HI> and of <HI>References</HI> is now offered to the public in one pocket volume.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only remark farther, that the <HI>Hi&s;to|ries</HI> may be con&s;idered as the LIVES of &s;o ma|ny eminent per&s;ons, and this collection of
<PB N="x" REF="9">
<HI>Maxims,</HI> as the MORALS. And I pre&s;ume, to add, with all due deference to the &s;entiments of others;&mdash;that <HI>The&s;e Lives and Morals</HI> will perhaps la&s;t as long, probably be as much ad|mired, and certainly prove much more exten|&s;ively beneficial (as they de&s;cribe per&s;ons ex|emplary in <HI>private</HI> and <HI>common</HI> life), than the <HI>Lives and Morals</HI> of the HEROES of the truly illu&s;trious philo&s;opher mentioned in the be|ginning of this Preface.</P>

<HEAD>Advantages <HI>of Men over Women, owing to Women
them&s;elves.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE love of prai&s;e, and to be flattered and admired, which predominates in the &s;ex, from &s;ixteen to &s;ixty, gives the men great advantages over them, iv. 465. [407].</P>
<P>The readine&s;s with which women are apt to forgive the men who have deceived other women;</P>
<P>And that incon&s;iderate notion of too many of them, <HI>that a reformed rake makes the be&s;t husband,</HI> are great en|couragements to vile men to continue their profligacy, iv. 466, &amp; &s;eq. [407, &amp; &s;eq].</P>
<P>Virtue and Sobriety are &s;urely as beautiful parts of a man's character as of a woman's. The mo&s;t abandon'd of men think the&s;e Graces indi&s;pen&s;able in the women they hope to marry&mdash;Shall women of prudence di&s;pen&s;e with them in the men they choo&s;e for partners for life? iv. 467. [408].</P>
<P>The fooli&s;h vanity which &s;ome women have in the hopes of reforming a wild young fellow, which others of their &s;ex have in vain tried to do, has often co&s;t them the happine&s;s of their lives; and given, at the &s;ame time, great encouragement to men to continue in their guilt; and to add, to their other vices, that of hypocri&s;y, if they think the object a prize worth feigning for, iv. 467, 468. [409].</P>
<P>The cruelty of women to an unhappy creature, who has been betrayed by the perfidy of her Lover; while they &s;cruple not to admit among them the vile &s;educer, is another great encouragement to ba&s;e and artful men, iv. 468. [409].</P>

<P>PERSONS may the rather hope to be extricated from difficulties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, if they have not involved them|&s;elves in them by their vanity and pre&s;umption, i. 266. [212].</P>

<P>YOUNG married Women who grow negligent in their dre&s;s, &s;hew a &s;light to the hu&s;band, that they &s;hewed not to the lover; and as good as declare, that they are indifferent about pre&s;erving the heart, which perhaps they took no &s;mall pains to engage, ii. 215. [207].</P>

<HEAD>Advice <HI>to Young Women.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG Woman, of whatever degree, who keeps men at a mode&s;t di&s;tance, will be &s;ure to be the more valued for it, even by tho&s;e who had formed de&s;igns upon her honour, i. 9. [8].</P>
<P>A truly worthy and mode&s;t Young Woman will value her&s;elf more on being de&s;cended from hone&s;t parents, though poor, than if &s;he were high-born, and her pa|rents unworthy, i. 11. [9].</P>
<P>The Young Woman who, at the reque&s;t of her pre|tended lover, keeps &s;ecret the indecencies offered to her by him, encourages him to repeat them, i. 26, 27. [22].</P>
<P>The anger of a &s;uperior to a Young Woman, who has had the virtue to repul&s;e him, is to be con&s;idered by her as her glory, i. 28. [23].</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="13">
She that is more a&s;hamed of di&s;hone&s;ty than of po|verty, will not be ea&s;ily overcome, i. 29. 44, 45. [24. 54].</P>
<P>A Young Woman who&s;e virtue has been once attempt|ed, yet throws her&s;elf into the &s;ame per&s;on's company, or continues where he is, when &s;he can avoid it, ought to charge her&s;elf with the con&s;equences, if &s;he receives new indignities, i. 50. 93. [41. 72, 73.] iii. 254. [201].</P>
<P>Tho&s;e things di&s;grace not men, in the eye of the world, which ruin Women, i. 54. [44].</P>
<P>The man who is capable of rudene&s;s to a Woman, to whom he profe&s;&s;es honourable love, ought to be reject|ed as an hu&s;band, by a Woman of virtue and &s;pirit, for his &s;ake, as well as for the &s;ake of her own honour, i. 64. [52, 53].</P>
<P>How much better is it by good fame and integrity, to get every one's good word but one, than by plea&s;ing that one, to incur the cen&s;ure of every-body el&s;e! i. 70. [57].</P>
<P>A man profe&s;&s;ing honour to a Woman, has it gene|rally in his power to convince her of his &s;incerity by more than words, i. 228. [181.]</P>
<P>Wicked men will &s;toop to the mo&s;t degrading mean|ne&s;s to obtain a favourite end, i. 338. [270].</P>
<P>If a Woman knows a man to be a libertine, yet will, without &s;cruple, give him her company, he will think half the ceremony between them is over; and will pro|bably only want an opportunity to make her repent of her confidence in him, iii. 230. [182].</P>
<P>When a man wi&s;hes a Young Woman of inferior cir|cum&s;tances to confide in his <HI>Honour,</HI> he ought to be ex|plicite, and not leave it to her to explain, in her own perhaps <HI>too</HI> hopeful way, what he means by the word. In &s;hort, the word <HI>Marriage</HI> is as &s;oon &s;poken as the word <HI>Honour,</HI> iii. 437. [345].</P>
<P>Men frequently take little liberties with Women; and as tho&s;e are received, are encouraged or di&s;couraged from greater; &s;o that it is in a Woman's power, effectu|ally to over-awe an audacious pre&s;umer; and obtain even &s;uch a one's good opinion and e&s;teem, iii. 469 to 473. [371 to 375].</P>
<P>A Young Woman will be in le&s;s danger when &s;he
<PB N="5" REF="14">
rather fears an enemy in the acquaintance &s;he favours of the other &s;ex, than hopes a friend; e&s;pecially as &s;o much depends upon the i&s;&s;ue either of her doubt, or of her confidence, iv. 446. [390].</P>
<P>A prudent Woman will not want to be reminded, with regard to her conduct to fops, coxcombs, and pretty fellows, that &s;he is not always &s;ecure in their company, by her &s;uperior good &s;en&s;e; &s;ince good Generals tru&s;ting to their &s;trength and &s;kill, have been often defeated by a weak enemy, iv. 447. [391].</P>
<P>The wife of a &s;elf-admirer mu&s;t expect a very cold and negligent hu&s;band, iv. 448. [392].</P>
<P>The Young Woman who will admit into her company any man who &s;hall be of opinion, and know it to be <HI>hers,</HI> that it is his province to a&s;k, hers to deny, will expo&s;e her reputation, if not her virtue, to great ri&s;ques, iv. 449. [393].</P>
<P>Pre&s;uming men are always ready to con&s;true every little civility in their own favour, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Men have generally more hardne&s;s of heart than Wo|men; whence the latter, when they meet not with men of honour, engage upon very unequal terms, iv. 454. [397].</P>
<P>It is &s;o cu&s;tomary with Men to make promi&s;es and vows, and to &s;et light by them when made, that a Wo|man ought not to regard any thing they either &s;ay or vow, that carries not demon&s;tration with it, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The difference in the education of men and Women, mu&s;t give the former great advantages over the latter, even where genius's are equal, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>A man who is worthy of the Woman he pretends to love, needs not, generally &s;peaking, take indirect means to obtain her in marriage, iv. 455. [398].</P>
<P>Hope, in material ca&s;es, &s;hould never be unaccom|panied by fear, iv. 458. [400].</P>
<P>When a Young Woman begins to find in her own heart an inclination to a man, pretending love to her; then, if he be not a man of undoubted honour, is her danger doubled, as ought to be her vigilance; &s;ince &s;he has <HI>her&s;elf</HI> to guard again&s;t, as well as him; iv. 458. [401].</P>
<P>A prudent Woman will not tru&s;t to her lover's mercy
<PB N="6" REF="15">
or honour, but to her own di&s;cretion; and the rather, as, if he mean well, he him&s;elf will value her the more for it; if not well, &s;he will detect him the &s;ooner, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The doubt which a Woman has of her lover's honour is needful, not only to pre&s;erve her own, but his. If &s;he wrongs him, &s;he can make him amends by in&s;tances of greater confidence, when &s;he plea&s;es: But if ye&s;terday &s;he granted him little favours, he will not allow her this day to recede; till at la&s;t, perhaps, &s;he puts her&s;elf out of her own power into his, in order to manife&s;t the in|&s;i&s;ted-on genero&s;ity of her affection for him, iv. 460. [402.]</P>
<P>There have been ca&s;es, where a man him&s;elf, pur&s;u|ing the dictates of his encroaching pa&s;&s;ion, and finding a Woman conceding, has taken advantages, which pro|bably at fir&s;t he did not pre&s;ume to think of, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<HEAD>EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>A FINE or genteel Education is generally of more di&s;&s;ervice than benefit to a young woman of no fortune, i. 125. [99].</P>
<P>People in a high condition generally &s;o educate their children, as not to &s;uffer them to bear the lea&s;t contra|diction to their violent wills; which indulgence, as they grow up, multiplies not only their own di&s;quiets, but tho&s;e of every one el&s;e, who have, concerns with them, i. 406. [ii. 32].</P>
<P>Tutors &s;hould treat their pupils, with regard to &s;uch of their faulty habits as cannot ea&s;ily be eradicated, as prudent phy&s;icians do their patients in chronical ca&s;es; rather with gentle palliatives than har&s;h extirpatives; which, by means of the re&s;i&s;tance given to them by the habit, may create &s;uch ferments as may utterly defeat their intention, iv. 305. [265].</P>
<P>A generous mind will choo&s;e to win youth to do its
<PB N="22" REF="31">
duty, by mildne&s;s and good u&s;age, rather than by &s;eve|rity, iv. 332. [289].</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be painful to &s;uch a one to be always incul|cating on his children or pupils, the doctrine of &s;elf-denial, in ca&s;es of an indifferent nature, by methods quite grievous to his own, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Encouragements given to children, &s;hould, however, be innocent ones; and not &s;uch as &s;hould lead to lux|ury, either of food or apparel, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The Almighty, by rewards and puni&s;hments, makes it our intere&s;t, as well as our duty, to obey him; and can we propo&s;e to our&s;elves, for the government of our children, a better example? <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t not expect from children, at an early age, that they &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h beyond facts, iv. 333. [290].</P>
<P><HI>Grown</HI> people have an eye to the reward for &s;ervice performed; nor will de&s;erve to be thought le&s;s good or virtuous, that they do a painful duty, and even that they &s;ubmit to be &s;ervants, for the reward's &s;ake, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Self-denial is indeed an excellent doctrine to be in|culcated into children's minds; and it mu&s;t be done early too; but we mu&s;t not be too &s;evere in enforcing it; for a duty too rigidly in&s;i&s;ted on, will make it odious, iv. 334. [290].</P>
<P>A child &s;hould not be either compelled or induced by rewards, to endeavour to ma&s;ter a &s;tudy or bya&s;s (that is not an indi&s;pen&s;able requi&s;ite to his future life or morals) to which it &s;hews a natural or riveted aver|&s;ion, iv. 335. [292].</P>
<P>If the Education and Studies of children were &s;uited to their inclinations and capacities, many would be made u&s;eful members of &s;ociety, that otherwi&s;e would make no figure in it, iv. 336. [292].</P>
<P>If, as the child grows up, its mind can be rai&s;ed from the love of the reward, to the love of its duty for the duty's &s;ake, it &s;hould by all means be done, iv. 336. [293].</P>
<P>The child which can be brought to prefer its duty to its appetites, (<HI>as Mr. Locke propo&s;es it &s;hould</HI>) wants but little of the &s;elf-denial of the wi&s;e&s;t philo&s;opher, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>If the child refu&s;es obedience, the parent mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="32">
upon it: The nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing &s;everity may be the i&s;&s;ue: A wi&s;e parent will therefore make as few things as po&s;|&s;ible nece&s;&s;ary parts of its duty, except they are likely to affect its future morals, iv. 337. [293].</P>
<P>Children, from their beginning to talk, <HI>Mr. Locke &s;ays,</HI> &s;hould have about them &s;ome &s;ober, di&s;creet per|&s;on, who&s;e care it &s;hould be, to keep them from the in|fection of bad company, iv. 338, 339. [295].</P>
<P>An acquaintance with the mu&s;es, in the Education of youth, contributes not a little to &s;often the manners. It gives a delicate turn to the imagination, and a kind of poli&s;h to the mind in &s;everer &s;tudies, iv. 353. [308].</P>
<P>However, it is not to wi&s;hed, that a youth &s;hould have &s;uch &s;trong inclinations that way, as to make that delightful amu&s;ement his predominant pa&s;&s;ion; &s;ince we &s;ee very few poets who&s;e warm imaginations do not run away with their judgments, iv. 354. [308].</P>
<P>And yet, in order to learn the dead languages in their purity, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tudy the antient poets; which cannot fail of giving youth a reli&s;h for poetry in general, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Latin and Language, <HI>in Mr. Locke's judgment,</HI> is the lea&s;t part of Education, iv. 386. [337].</P>
<P><HI>See his method by which a mother may teach her &s;on Latin, without her under&s;tanding it her&s;elf; and Pamela's rea&s;onings upon it,</HI> iv. 385, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> [337, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI></P>

<P>Languages and Sciences, and all other accompli&s;h|ments of Education, will be to no purpo&s;e, Mr. Locke ob&s;erves, but to make the wor&s;e and more dangerous man, if the tutor makes it not his chief care to form the mind of his &s;cholar, &s;o as to keep out evil and vicious habits, iv. 386. [338].</P>
<P>On a <HI>Home</HI> and <HI>School</HI> EDUCATION.</P>
<P>MR. Locke, for &s;everal weighty rea&s;ons, prefers a <HI>Home</HI> to a <HI>School</HI> Education; but makes it next to im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="24" REF="33">
to procure &s;uch a tutor, as he thinks nece&s;&s;ary to direct it, iv. 338. [294]. [<HI>See</HI> TUTOR.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, he &s;ays, that in a <HI>School</HI> Education, a ma&s;ter can have a great number of boys under his eye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> any longer than they are in School together, iv. 342. [338].</P>
<P><HI>Hence Pamela takes occa&s;ion humbly to propo&s;e it as a matter for her Mr. B's con&s;ideration and determina|tion, Whether there cannot be found out,</HI></P>
<P><HI>A middle way of</HI> EDUCATION <HI>between both.</HI></P>
<P>CANNOT, <HI>a&s;ks &s;he,</HI> &s;ome ma&s;ter be engaged, who &s;hall be &s;o well rewarded for his care of a few, as &s;hall make it worth his while to be contented with tho&s;e few? Suppo&s;e five, &s;ix, &s;even, or eight, at mo&s;t, who&s;e mo|rals and good breeding he may attend to, as well as to their learning? iv. 343. <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> [299, <HI>&amp; &s;eq</HI>].</P>
<P>The further this ma&s;ter lives from the friends of the young gentleman, perhaps the better it will be, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;hould be a man of mild temper; but &s;trict in his di&s;cipline;</P>
<P>One who makes it a rule not to give correction for &s;mall faults; or till every other method has been tried;</P>
<P>Who carries &s;uch a ju&s;t dignity in his manner, with|out the appearance of tyranny, that his looks may be of greater force than the chidings of &s;ome; and his chid|ings than the &s;tripes of others;</P>
<P>And who will rather endeavour to &s;hame, than terrify a youth out of his faults:</P>
<P>She &s;uppo&s;es, that this gentleman &s;hould allot a par|ticular portion of time for the pro&s;ecuting of the more <HI>learned</HI> &s;tudies;</P>
<P>And before the youth was tired with them, &s;he &s;up|po&s;es another portion &s;hould be allotted for writing and arithmetic;</P>
<P>And then, for a relief to his mind, that the dancing|ma&s;ter &s;hould take his part;</P>
<P>Innocent recreations to fill up the re&s;t, at his own choice; in which, diverted by &s;uch a rotation of em|ployments (all rendered delightful by their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive variety), he would hardly wi&s;h to pa&s;s much time;</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="34">
Since the dancing it&s;elf will an&s;wer both parts; that of good breeding, and that of exerci&s;e;</P>
<P>And thus different Studies may at once be ma&s;tered.</P>
<P>Moreover, the emulation which will be rai&s;ed where there are &s;everal young gentlemen, will greatly le&s;&s;en the trouble of the tutor, and advance the learning of the pupils:</P>
<P>An emulation which cannot be obtained in a home education, where there is but a &s;ingle youth to be taken care of;</P>
<P>Such a ma&s;ter, not having a great number of &s;ervants, will be better able to an&s;wer for their conduct and be|haviour;</P>
<P>The young gentlemen will have young gentlemen for their companions; all under the influence of the &s;ame precepts and example;</P>
<P>And as little honours and di&s;tinctions mu&s;t needs be very attractive to the minds of youth, &s;uppo&s;e, as a re|ward for &s;ome excellence, the excelling youth &s;hould be &s;et to read at a little de&s;k rai&s;ed a &s;tep or two, to his ma&s;ter and &s;choolfellows, &s;ometimes a little portion from the be&s;t tran&s;lations of the Greek or Roman hi&s;tories, at other times from the Engli&s;h hi&s;tories;</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter explaining difficult pa&s;&s;ages and cu&s;toms, as the youth proceeded;</P>
<P>Might not this, in a very engaging manner, initiate them into the knowlege of the hi&s;tory of pa&s;t times, and of their own country; and lead them, in the ma&s;ter's ab&s;ence, to pa&s;s &s;ome of their vacant hours in the like laudable manner?</P>
<P>Why may not like triumphs on excelling be as incen|tive to engage children to conquer difficult ta&s;ks, as the Roman triumphs, their civic and mural crowns, were to the heroes of old; &s;ince men, as the poet ob&s;erves, are but children of a larger growth? iv. 346. [301].</P>
<P><HI>But if a</HI> Home Education <HI>is cho&s;en, to which Pa|mela, as well as Mr. Locke inclines, &s;he thus expa|tiates upon the qualities of a tutor;</HI> iv. 349. [304].</P>
<P>He ought to be a man of free and generous principles; yet not tainted with &s;ceptical or heterodox notions,</P>

<P><PB N="26" REF="35">
Who&s;e behaviour and carriage is ea&s;y, unaffected, gen|teel;</P>
<P>Who is not, on one hand, dogmatical, po&s;itive, or over|bearing; on the other, yielding, &s;uppliant, fawning;</P>
<P>Who will &s;tudy the child's natural bent, in order to direct his genius to the attainment which he is mo&s;t likely to ma&s;ter:</P>
<P>In order to pre&s;erve the re&s;pect due to his own cha|racter with every one, he mu&s;t not be a tale-bearer, a whi&s;perer, a bu&s;y-body in the family;</P>
<P>Mu&s;t, on the contrary, have a benevolent turn of mind: Be ready, without officiou&s;ne&s;s, to compo&s;e dif|ferences;</P>
<P>Who will avoid the foppi&s;hne&s;s in dre&s;s, by which the petit-maitres and French u&s;hers at boarding-&s;chools often di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves; &s;ince peculiarities of habit, and uncharacteri&s;tic appearance, generally denote a wrong head, iv. 350. [304, &amp; &s;eq].</P>
<P><HI>As in a</HI> home education <HI>it will be very difficult to keep children, as Mr. Locke requires, from the con|ver&s;ation of &s;ervants;</HI></P>
<P>It will be a &s;ecurer as well as more laudable method, for parents to in&s;i&s;t upon the regular behaviour of the whole family, than to expect that the child and its tutor &s;hall be the only good ones in it, iv. 355. [310].</P>
<P>Nor is this &s;o difficult to be effected, as &s;ome may imagine. If, on the hiring of a new &s;ervant, &s;obriety of manners, and a virtuous conver&s;ation be in&s;i&s;ted upon, as indi&s;pen&s;ible conditions of their continuing in their &s;ervice; and if the principals take care to &s;upport their injunctions by their own example, it would be &s;een, that if their &s;ervice did not find them good, it would make them &s;o, iv. 356. [310].</P>

<HEAD>Female EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Education of a young lady of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, it will be be&s;t to endeavour, till &s;he can be taught to love virtue for its own &s;ake, to conduct her &s;pirit to pro|per ends, rather than totally to &s;ubdue it, iv. 303. [263].</P>
<P>There may be a decent pride in humility, iv. 303. [264].</P>
<P>A young lady may behave with &s;o much true dignity, as &s;hall command re&s;pect by the turn of her eye, &s;ooner than by a&s;&s;uming &s;peech, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>A young lady &s;hould be told, that it is no honour to be better born than &s;ervants, if &s;he be not better behaved too, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>And that humility is a grace that &s;hines in a high con|dition; but cannot, equally in a low one; becau&s;e a per|&s;on in the latter is already, perhaps, too much humbled, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Women in their education, <HI>Pamela &s;ays,</HI> are generally forced to &s;truggle for knowlege like the poor feeble in|fant who is pinioned, legs, arms, and head, on the nur&s;e's lap, iv. 347. [302].</P>

<P>So when a poor girl, in &s;pite of her narrow education, breaks into notice, her genius is immediately tamed by trifling employments, and &s;he is kept back, as if it were apprehended &s;he would become the envy of her own &s;ex, and rai&s;e the jealou&s;y of the other, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>MR. <HI>B's rea&s;ons given to his Pamela, why people of birth, and born to high fortune, are often more un|happy in marriage, than tho&s;e in middle life.</HI></P>
<P>We are generally educated wrong, <HI>&s;ays he.</HI> We are u&s;ually head&s;trong in our wills, and being unaccu&s;tomed to controul from our CRADLES, know not how to bear it, ii. 345. [314].</P>
<P>Humoured by our NURSES, thro' the fault of our pa|rents, we practice fir&s;t upon them, by an in&s;olence that ought then to be re&s;trained, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Next, we are to be indulged and favoured at SCHOOL. Our learning generally &s;ucceeds with us accordingly; and we reward our ma&s;ters as we did our nur&s;es, with greater in&s;tances of our in&s;olence than ob&s;ervance, ii. 346. [314].</P>

<P>Neither of them having ever been &s;ubject to controul, nor hardly to contradiction, the man cannot bear it from one, who&s;e new relation to him, and vow of obedience, he thinks &s;hould oblige her to yield up her will entirely to his, ii. 347. [315].</P>
<P>The lady, well-read in nothing, perhaps, but romances, thinks it very ungallant, now, for the fir&s;t time to be controuled, and that by the man from whom &s;he ex|pected nothing but tenderne&s;s, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>WE are apt to expect more regard from relations, they more indulgence from us, than &s;trangers can have rea&s;on for, iii. 25. [20].</P>
<P>If you bear with their faults, there will be no end of impo&s;itions; if you di&s;mi&s;s them, you will have their ill-will; they will impute to pride and unnaturalne&s;s, your very ju&s;tice. Your pro&s;perous lot will rai&s;e you enemies, who will believe them rather than you, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The world, moreover, will be apt to think, you are crouding upon our benefactor a numerous family of low and indigent people, tho' they &s;hould be ever &s;o de&s;erv|ing, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>One would not therefore, for <HI>their</HI> &s;akes, accept of their &s;ervices; e&s;pecially as they may &s;erve others with equal benefit to them&s;elves, iii. 25. [21].</P>
<P>For I would not that any of them &s;hould be lifted out of his &s;tation, and made independent at Mr. B's expence, if their own indu&s;try would not make them &s;o; tho' I would never &s;cruple, rea&s;onably, to reward their indu&s;try in the way of their callings, iii. 26. [21].</P>
<P>If you receive &s;ome of them, will not others expect to be equally favoured? And may not this &s;ow the &s;eeds of envy among <HI>them,</HI> and occa&s;ion ill will to <HI>you? ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. B. him&s;elf will perhaps, when he vi&s;its you for a month or two, as he propo&s;es, be under &s;ome polite dif|ficulty how to avoid taking notice of people who are your relations, tho' were they not &s;o, their offices would not intitle them to it, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

As for my&s;elf, believe me, I could &s;it down and re|joice with the meane&s;t and remote&s;t relation I have: But to the world's eye, I mu&s;t, if I have ever &s;o much reluctance to appear &s;uperior in theirs, endeavour to be|have &s;o properly as not to give additional di&s;credit to his choice, iii. 26.

<P>And will you not have it in your power, without in|juring in the lea&s;t our common benefactor, and without incurring cen&s;ure for your partiality, to do kinder things by any of our relations, when <HI>not</HI> with you, than you can do, were they to live with you? <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>The honours paid abroad to Engli&s;h travellers, more than to tho&s;e of any other nation, &s;hould be an incite|ment to them, as well for their own credit, as for that of their country, to behave worthy of the di&s;tinction, iv. 420. [367].</P>
<P><HI>The &s;ubject of</HI> Travelling, <HI>or making the</HI> grand tour, <HI>entered upon in the following particulars.</HI></P>
<P>The age of young gentlemen, from &s;ixteen to twenty-one, an improper one to &s;et out upon their travels; and why, iv. 430. [376].</P>
<P>Mr. Locke thinks from &s;even to fourteen, a much more eligible one, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>If the rea&s;ons he gives for this age determine not, he propo&s;es, that the young man's Travelling be &s;u&s;pend|ed, till that more &s;edate time of life, when he may travel without a tutor, and be able to make his own ob&s;erva|tions; and is thoroughly acquainted with the laws and fa&s;hions, the natural and moral advantages and defects, of his own country, iv. 431. [376, 377].</P>
<P>Pamela de&s;cants on the advantages a youth may reap by home travelling, before he enters upon a foreign tour; propo&s;ing the age of fourteen or fifteen for be|ginning it, by excur&s;ions in the &s;ummer months, be|tween his other &s;tudies, and as a diver&s;ion to him, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>She is of opinion, that the&s;e excur&s;ions might be made to mo&s;t advantage in company of his father, as well as tutor, and gives her rea&s;on for it, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>If his father cannot accompany the youth, &s;he pro|po&s;es what may be of the next greate&s;t advantage in this &s;cheme of home-travelling, to both &s;on and tutor, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>That the young man vi&s;it the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, as well as inland parts of Great Britain and Ireland, and the other principal circumjacent i&s;lands, iv. 432, 433. [378].</P>
<P>That he look into the art of navigation; the curious &s;tructure of a &s;hip, as he is a native of the greate&s;t ma|ritime kingdom in the world: From which knowlege, tho' but in theory, he will be taught to love and value the Briti&s;h &s;ailors, an u&s;eful and brave &s;et of men, who
<PB N="77" REF="86">
are the natural defence and &s;afeguard of the realm, iv. 433. [378].</P>
<P>With the advantages which he will obtain by this knowlege of his own country, he will be qualified to go abroad, and be better able to judge of the different cu&s;toms, manners, and forms of government of foreign countries, iv. 433. [379].</P>
<P>All his enquiries will be pertinent and manly: All occa&s;ions of that ignorant wonder, which expo&s;es to ri|dicule the raw young men &s;ent abroad, would be taken away. He would make the be&s;t acquaintance, having &s;omething to inform them of in relation to his own coun|try, in return for the information they give him of theirs. He would contract worthy friend&s;hips, and be looked upon as one of the ri&s;ing genius's of his country, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>MR. <HI>B. acquaints his Pamela with what his expecta|tions of his wife's behaviour to him, would have been, had &s;he been a prince&s;s; as follows:</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t have been morally &s;ure, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that &s;he pre|ferred me to all other men. She mu&s;t have borne with my imperfections. She mu&s;t have &s;tudied my temper: And if ever &s;he had any points to carry, any de&s;ire of overcoming, it mu&s;t have been by &s;weetne&s;s and com|plai&s;ance:</P>
<P>And yet, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> not &s;uch a &s;lavi&s;h one, as &s;hould make her conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;eem to be rather the effect of her in&s;en&s;ibility, than of her judgment and affection:</P>
<P>I &s;hould have thought I ought not to have de&s;ired any thing of her, that was not rea&s;onable to be complied with; and that then &s;he &s;hould have &s;hewn no reluctance, unea&s;ine&s;s, or doubt, to oblige me, even at half a word;</P>
<P>Yet if I were not always in the right, I &s;hould expect that &s;he &s;hould bear with me, if &s;he &s;aw me determined; and that &s;he &s;hould expo&s;tulate with me on the right &s;ide of compliance;</P>
<P>This would have &s;hewn me, that &s;he differed from me, not for contradiction &s;ake; but de&s;ired to convince me for my own; and that I &s;hould another time take fitter re&s;olutions.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="90">
In all companies &s;he mu&s;t have &s;hewn, that &s;he had an high opinion of, and regard for me, whether altogether de&s;erved, or not.</P>
<P>And this the rather, as &s;uch a regard would be not only a reputation, but a &s;ecurity to her&s;elf; &s;ince, if libertines ever attempt a married woman, their fir&s;t in|citement, next to their own vanity, ari&s;es from her known indifference to, or contempt of, her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have expected, therefore, that &s;he would draw a kind veil over my faults: That &s;uch as &s;he could not hide, &s;he would endeavour to extenuate; and &s;hew to every one, that I had <HI>her</HI> good opinion, whatever liberties the world took with my character.</P>
<P>She mu&s;t have valued my friends for my &s;ake; been chearful and ea&s;y, whom&s;oever I brought home with me; and whatever faults &s;he had ob&s;erved in me, have never blamed me before company; much le&s;s, with &s;uch an air, as &s;hould have &s;hewn, that &s;he had a better opi|nion of her own judgment than of mine.</P>
<P>I know, <HI>proceeds he,</HI> my own imperfections: They are many and great; yet I will not allow that they &s;hould excu&s;e tho&s;e of my Wife; or give her room to imagine I will bear faults in her, which &s;he <HI>can</HI> rectify, becau&s;e &s;he &s;ees greater in me.</P>

<P>And then (your behaviour &s;uch) I &s;hould &s;corn my|&s;elf, if there were one privilege of a Wife, that a prince&s;s, were &s;he my Wife, might expect to be indulg|ed in, that I would not allow to you, ii. 349, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> [316, <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI>]</P>

<P>The <HI>&s;malle&s;t</HI> conce&s;&s;ion made by a woman, re&s;enting an Outrage actually made upon her honour, is as much to the purpo&s;e of the Violator as the <HI>greate&s;t,</HI> v. 173. [vi. 77].</P>

<HEAD>Reformation. Conviction. Conver&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN can hardly be expected to reform, who re|&s;olves not to quit the evil company he has been accu&s;tom|ed to delight in, i. 226. [234].</P>
<P>Pretences to in&s;tantaneous Convictions are to be &s;u&s;pect|ed, i. 236. [245].</P>
<P>Conviction is half way to amendment, i. 260. [270].</P>
<P>To reform by an enemy's malevolence, is the noble&s;t revenge in the world, i. 265. [275].</P>
<P>Very few Convictions ari&s;e from vehement debatings, i. 384. [ii. 75].</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep to Reformation is to &s;ubdue &s;udden gu&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion, and to be patient under di&s;appointment, ii. 27. [120].</P>
<P>The mo&s;t abandon'd of Libertines generally mean one day to reform, ii. 378. [iii. 111, 112]. <HI>Should they not therefore, even as Libertines, re&s;olve again&s;t atrocious guilt, were it but to make their future compunction le&s;s pungent?</HI>]</P>
<P>Reformation cannot be a &s;udden work, ii. 378. 391. [iii. 112. 124].</P>
<P>There is more hope of the Reformation of a man of &s;en&s;e, than of a fool, ii. 393. <HI>See al&s;o</HI> i. 262. [iii. 126. <HI>See al&s;o</HI> i. 272].</P>

<P>A man who errs with his eyes open, and again&s;t Con|viction, is the wor&s;e for what he knows, iii. 6. [151].</P>

<P>Women think, that the reclaiming of a man from bad habits, <HI>as Lovelace him&s;elf ob&s;erves,</HI> is a much ea&s;ier ta&s;k than in the nature of things it can be, v. 299. [vi. 211].</P>

<P>Little do innocents think what a total revolution of manners, what a change of fixed habits, nay, what a conque&s;t of a bad nature, and what a portion of divine grace, is required to make a profligate man a good hu&s;band, a worthy father, and a true friend, from PRINCIPLE, vii. 142.

<P>It is a high degree of pre&s;umption for a woman to &s;uppo&s;e her own virtue &s;o &s;ecure, as that &s;he may marry a profligate in hopes to reclaim him, vii. 202. [viii. 125].</P>
<P>The &s;incerity of that man's Reformation is hardly to be doubted, who can patiently bear being reminded of his pa&s;t follies, and when he can occa&s;ionally expre&s;s an abhorrence of them, vii. 251. [viii. 175].</P>

<P>Self-diffidence is often a weakne&s;s in young men, which &s;uffers them to be influenced by men of talents in|ferior to their own, iii. 41. [201].</P>
<P>A young man of natural good principles mu&s;t have his judgment mi&s;led before he can allow him&s;elf in a deviation, iii. 42. [202].</P>

<P>WHAT a frail tenure is that by which a Kept Woman holds! ii. 94. [195].</P>
<P>Keeping men often yield up points to the teazing arts of a low-born mi&s;tre&s;s, which they would not concede to a worthy wife, ii. 98. [199].</P>
<P>Keepers (made by their vices real &s;laves) imagine them&s;elves ma&s;ters of their liberty, and &s;it down &s;atisfied with the &s;ound of the word, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>Every quarterly payment, every pre&s;ent made, to a per&s;on engaged in a guilty Attachment, mu&s;t &s;trike her to the heart, when overtaken by compunction, to be|hold in it the wages of her &s;hame, ii. 324, 325. [iii. 68, 69].</P>

<P>The woman who &s;tipulates a price for her virtue, knows the uncertainty of the tenure by which &s;he holds, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>How can a Keeper complain of the mi&s;behaviour of his woman, be it ever &s;o ba&s;e? Does &s;he not fir&s;t mi&s;be|have to her&s;elf, to her &s;ex, and break thro' all laws divine and human? ii. 328. [iii. 72].</P>
<P>Ought a man who brings a woman to violate her fir&s;t duties, to expect from her a regard to a mere di&s;cre|tionary obligation? <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be a wretchedne&s;s beyond what can be con|ceived, for a man and woman to live together a life of guilt, yet with hatred, animo&s;ity, or even indifference, to each other, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>God knows what he will forgive; but his forgivene&s;s, however, depends, in a great mea&s;ure, upon the offen|ders them&s;elves, ii. 329. [iii. 73].</P>

<P>Keepers are generally, tho' bravoes of the law, cowards and cullies to their paramours, ii. 330. [iii. 74].</P>
<P>Indeed the courage of the men, who can defy the laws of &s;ociety (to magnanimity they mu&s;t be &s;trangers) is ever to be doubted, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The Keeper, by the &s;ame act, &s;inks his own con&s;e|quence, and generally rai&s;es that of an inferior and low|bred woman, ii. 332. [iii. 76].</P>

<P>What tie can bind a woman who has parted with her honour? <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>What, in a Guilty Attachment, mu&s;t be a man's alter|native, but either to be the tyrant of a wretch who has given him rea&s;on to de&s;pi&s;e her, or the dupe of one who de&s;pi&s;es him? <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>True Love is always mode&s;t and diffident, i. 48. 103. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Trifles are acceptable from tho&s;e we love, i. 61. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Women ought not to be a&s;hamed of owning a &s;u&s;cep|tibility of a natural pa&s;&s;ion, when duty and prudence are their guides, and the object worthy, i. 87. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Women, when they begin to <HI>like,</HI> &s;hould look into their hearts; &s;ince <HI>Love</HI> is not then far off, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>A prudent woman will &s;hut the door of her heart again&s;t the blind deity, when &s;he finds he has &s;et his incroaching foot on the thre&s;hold, i. 88, 89. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Such a one will endeavour to keep her heart her own, till duty adds force to the lambent flame, i. 89. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P><HI>Making Love,</HI> as it is called, is an <HI>ungenerous</HI> abu&s;e of the ears of a young woman; &s;ince a man can addre&s;s whom he plea&s;es, and a woman mu&s;t wait his motions; and &s;ince we are all ready to believe what we wi&s;h, i. 113. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>A man who truly loves, cannot, without pain, allow him&s;elf to teaze, by importunity, the object of his pa&s;|&s;ion, who favours him not, i. 122. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>One of the greate&s;t pains that a grateful heart can know, is to be obliged to deny a worthy man, who ten|derly loves her, i. 124. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Re&s;pectful Love is not the indication either of a weak head, or a faint heart, i. 143. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>Violent Love is not likely to be la&s;ting, i. 151. [<HI>ibid</HI>].</P>
<P>It is one of the &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ures imaginable, to hear a whole circle join in applauding the ab&s;ent per&s;on who &s;tands high in our opinion, i. 410. [ii. 95].</P>

Love is made a cover to ba&s;ene&s;s of heart, when the pretender to it &s;eeks to gratify his own pa&s;&s;ion, at the expence of the happine&s;s or duty of the object, ii. 60. [161].</P>
<P>In a pure flame Love and Friend&s;hip cannot be &s;e|parated, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Love is a word, that is often made a cover to the vile&s;t cupidity, ii. 92. [193].</P>
<P>Love [however, dignified by romancers and poets] is a narrower of the heart; &s;ince, while its &s;ucce&s;s is in &s;u&s;|pence, it is the parent of envy, jealou&s;y, di&s;&s;imulation, ii. 141. 283. iii. 32. [ii. 242. iii. 27. 192].</P>
<P>That Love which is founded on fancy, or exterior ad|vantages, may, and oftentimes ought to, be overcome, ii. 144. [245].</P>
<P>But that which is founded on interior worth, generally acknowledged, cannot be ea&s;ily re&s;trained, damped, &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, ii. 144. v. 67. [ii. 245. vi. 45].</P>
<P>Women do not often with <HI>earne&s;tne&s;s</HI> reject a man, who is not quite di&s;agreeable, if they are not prejudiced in another's favour, ii. 160. [261].</P>
<P>It is no wonder that a man who is always worthily employ'd, is not in love; &s;ince Love is the child of lei|&s;ure and indolence, ii. 185, 186. iii. 218. [ii. 286, 287. iv. 4].</P>
<P>A woman who means not preferable favour to a man, will allow her&s;elf in &s;aying civil and polite things to him, ii. 192. [293].</P>
<P>There are &s;ubjects that cannot be touched upon, with|out rai&s;ing emotion in the bo&s;om of a per&s;on who hopes, and is uncertain, ii. 193. [294].</P>
<P>Why &s;hould women be a&s;hamed of owning a <HI>laudable</HI> pa&s;&s;ion? There is nothing &s;hameful in di&s;creet Love, ii. 239. iv. 66. [ii. 340. iv. 238].</P>
<P>Love is a &s;elfi&s;h deity: He puts two per&s;ons upon pre|ferring their own intere&s;t, nay, often a gratification of their pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t their intere&s;t, to tho&s;e of every-body el&s;e; and rea&s;on, di&s;cretion, duty, are frequently given up in a competition with it, ii. 240.

<P>Parents &s;hould be indulgent [to tho&s;e who are to &s;uc|ceed them in carrying on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world]: But children, when they put them&s;elves in one &s;cale, &s;hould allow parents their due weight in the other, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>A worthy woman will bani&s;h that love from her heart, which would corrupt its &s;implicity, and make her guilty of artifice, ii. 258. [iii. 2, 3].</P>
<P>Womens eyes are wanderers, and too often bring home gue&s;ts that are very trouble&s;ome, and whom, once in|troduced, they cannot get out of the hou&s;e, ii. 268. [iii. 12].</P>
<P>The voice, as well as the heart, is &s;weetened, mel|lowed, harmonized by Love, ii. 306. iii. 350. 378. [iii. 50. iv. 136. 164].</P>
<P>It is a hard matter for women, in Love-ca&s;es, to avoid affectation, ii. 391. [iii. 135].</P>
<P>A lady, in &s;u&s;pending unnece&s;&s;arily the happine&s;s of the man to whom &s;he has no objection, and whom &s;he re&s;olves to marry, &s;eems to confe&s;s &s;elf-denial, ii. 392. [iii. 136].</P>
<P>E&s;teem is the female word for Love, ii. 403. [iii. 147].</P>
<P>The woman who has been di&s;appointed in Love, will be able to play with another flame without burning her fingers, iii. 4. [163, 164].</P>
<P>A prudent man or woman will never leave MIND out of his or her notion of Love, iii. 12. [171].</P>
<P>Women often take pains to cheat them&s;elves into a belief that they are not in Love; but detect them&s;elves by the very pains they take to obviate &s;uch a charge, iii. 14. [173].</P>
<P>Of what ab&s;urd things does the pa&s;&s;ion called Love, makes its votaries guilty! iii. 37. [197].</P>

<P>The tenderne&s;s, and even veneration which a worthy man &s;hews to a de&s;ervedly-beloved object, is not a dero|gation from his character, iii. 52. [212].</P>
<P>Love, like water, will work its way thro' the banks that are &s;et up to confine it, if not watched, and dammed out in time, iii. 93. [253].</P>
<P>The poi&s;on of Love once taken in at the eye, will &s;oon diffu&s;e it&s;elf thro' the ma&s;s, iii. 125. [285].</P>
<P>Seldom, as the women &s;uppo&s;e, is there that fervor in a &s;econd love, as in a fir&s;t, iii. 153. [313].</P>
<P>Women, in Love-ca&s;es, &s;ee into each other's hearts from &s;mall openings, iii. 257. [iv. 43].</P>
<P>A young woman, challenged with loving a man who has made no declaration, if the challenge be ju&s;t, need not to labour under a greater difficulty, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Reverence will not ea&s;ily allow of the innocent fa|miliarity that is requi&s;ite in love, iii. 260. [iv. 46].</P>
<P>What a remembrancer is the heart in a Love-ca&s;e! Not a circum&s;tance e&s;capes it, iii. 260. [iv. 60].</P>
<P>If a woman loves a man for his merit <HI>only,</HI> may &s;he not love merits equally great in another, and even in one of her own &s;ex? iii. 275. [iv. 61].</P>
<P>True Love makes every ta&s;k ea&s;y, every burthen light, iii. 332. [iv. 118].</P>
<P>Young people often, in compliment to their own un|der&s;tandings, per&s;evere in a fir&s;t flame, which ought to be di&s;couraged, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Love gilds every object that bears a relation to the object beloved, iv. 27. [199].</P>
<P>There is, <HI>&s;ays Lady</HI> G. a great deal of free-ma&s;onry in Love: The &s;ecret, like that, when found out, is hardly worth the knowing [The Paphian Love &s;he mu&s;t mean] iv. 84. [256].</P>
<P>Love, however, at be&s;t, is a flame founded on a but &s;uppo&s;ed merit. The proof may be wanting in matri|mony, iv. 203. [v. 74].</P>
<P>What is that Love which we women, <HI>&s;ays Lady G.</HI> vow at the altar? Surely not adoration, iv. 246. [v. 117].</P>

Not a preference of that object ab&s;olutely, as in ex|cellence &s;uperior to every imaginable being, iv. 246. [v. 117].</P>

<P>Who &s;he thinks is no di&s;agreeable companion; but de&s;erves her grateful regard, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>That his intere&s;t, from thenceforth, &s;hould be her own; and his happine&s;s her &s;tudy, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>And is not this very con&s;i&s;tent with &s;eeing and pitying, in this partner of her life, &s;uch imperfections as make him evidently the inferior of angels? <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Di&s;appoinment in Love may operate in different minds different ways, iv. 258. [v. 129].</P>
<P>Young women often go on courageou&s;ly with a Lover, while the end in view is di&s;tant, or there have been dif|ficulties to encounter with, iv. 261. [v. 132].</P>
<P>But when tho&s;e difficulties are overcome, and they have climbed the hill they toiled up, they often look about them with fear as &s;trong as their hope, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The controul of tho&s;e we truly love, is freedom, iv. 395. [v. 266].</P>
<P>How &s;weet is the affiance which a woman has in the declaration of a man of principle, whom &s;he loves! v. 51. [vi. 29].</P>
<P>Love-matches, <HI>Lady G. &s;ays,</HI> are generally fooli&s;h things, v. 65. [vi. 43].</P>
<P>Violent Love on one &s;ide, is enough in con&s;cience, if the other party be not a fool, or ingrateful, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>The wall-climbers, the hedge and ditch-leapers, the river-forders, the window-droppers, always find rea&s;on to think it &s;o, <HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Who ever, <HI>proceeds &s;he,</HI> hears of darts, flames, cupids, venus's, and &s;uch &s;ort of non&s;en&s;e, in matrimony? <HI>ibid.</HI></P>

<P>A man of &s;en&s;e, in Love, will pre&s;erve his dignity; yet, for his own &s;ake, will give con&s;equence to the lady whom he one day hopes to call his wife, v. 133. [vi. 111].</P>
<P>Love will plead for its votary in a &s;ingle brea&s;t, when con&s;ultation on the &s;uppo&s;ed fit and unfit (the object ab|&s;ent) will produce delay, v. 168. [vi. 146].</P>
<P>A little cold water will quench a beginning flame in a young per&s;on; or, if it do not, its blaze may be di|rected by prudent management to another and more pro|per object, v. 184. [vi. 162].</P>
<P>Love on one &s;ide, di&s;cretion on the other, is much better than love on both; &s;ince in the latter ca&s;e, if the Love be of the u&s;ual giddy &s;ort, there can be no room at all for di&s;cretion, v. 186. [vi. 164].</P>
<P>Love ever makes a woman think meanly of her&s;elf, in proportion as &s;he thinks highly of the object, v. 196. [vi. 174].</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>Copy of LETTER to a LADY, who was &s;olicitous for an
additional volume to the HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON;
&s;uppo&s;ing it ended abruptly, and expre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf de&s;irous to
&s;ee Sir CHARLES in the Parental Cha|racter; and to know if the Story
were intended to be carried further.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Mar. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.
1754.</DATE></DATELINE> 
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE> </OPENER>
<P>I Write to your commands &s;ent me ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>I have no intention of pur&s;uing further the Hi&s;tory of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON: And hope, when you con&s;ider the cir|cum&s;tances of the Story, you will be of opinion, that it ends very properly where it does; tho' at the fir&s;t peru&s;al it may &s;eem, to a Lady who honours the piece with her approbation, to conclude a little abruptly; and the rather, as the nece&s;&s;ary delay in publi&s;hing the la&s;t volume, occa&s;ioned by the treatment I met with from Dublin, made per&s;ons imagine that marvellous events, and violent cata&s;trophes, were preparing; and but for which treatment the three la&s;t volumes would have been publi&s;hed together.</P>
<P>The Story of PAMELA was &s;uppo&s;ed to have taken place within thirty years, that of CLARISSA within twenty, of their re&s;pective publications. In either of tho&s;e &s;paces of time, there was room to marry and bury half a generation of people.</P>
<P>That of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON is &s;uppo&s;ed to be more recent. In his recital of what pa&s;&s;ed between him&s;elf and Clementina, long before the Story began, and before he had hopes of being allowed by his Father (then living) to return to England, he mentions the rebellion in 1745 and 1746; and that the exult|ations made over him in Italy, on the reported &s;ucce&s;s of the young Adventurer, obliged him to go to Vienna.</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;ed between him and Clementina, and her Family, on his return from thence to Bologna, till he quitted Italy, and (on his Father's death) arrived in England, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to take up a con&s;iderable &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>He had been about fifteen months in England when the Story begins. That takes up a year and half.</P>
<P>All this may be &s;uppo&s;ed to bring it down pretty near to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>EMILY, under the direction of &s;o prudent a guardian, was not, for example &s;ake, to be married till &s;he was near twenty.</P>
<P>Lady GRANDISON'S circum&s;tances and her lying-in, would not
<PB N="404" REF="412">
permit her to leave England for a voyage to Italy, &s;o &s;oon as might be hoped for by Clementina and her friends. Sir Charles had a view, I fan&s;y, to tho&s;e delicate circum&s;tances, when he offered to make them judges of the rea&s;ons, &s;hould he and his Harriet be unable to attend them within the next year, why they could not.</P>
<P>Do you think Harriet would not be a Nur&s;e as well as Lady G? It would be a de&s;irable thing, we may &s;uppo&s;e, to all their Italian friends, as well as &s;uitable to the maternal fondne&s;s, for her to take her child with her: But would &s;he do &s;o, till it was at lea&s;t a year old? There is no doubt but it would be a very fine and forward child: But the heir of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on mu&s;t not be needle&s;ly, or for a compliment, expo&s;ed to dangers and difficulties. Read again the pa&s;&s;age by land over mount Cenis; acquaint your|&s;elf with the Bay of Bi&s;cay, were they to go by &s;ea.</P>
<P>As to the good JERONYMO, he is happy where he is. Lady G. makes him alive and merry: And have you not an intimation that he is to go to Bath? And do you think that tho&s;e &s;alutary &s;prings will not, for the honour of our country, quite e&s;tabli&s;h him?</P>
<P>CLEMENTINA, at the year's end, may either marry the Count of BELVEDERE, her malady not returning; or, as Sir Charles has engaged all her friends to promi&s;e, may, at her own reque&s;t, be allowed more time. You have &s;een that the COUNT acquie&s;ces entirely with whatever &s;hall be her will, in this particular.</P>
<P>Do you think, Madam, I have not been very complai&s;ant to my Readers to leave to them the deci&s;ion of this important article? I am apt to think, from what I have already heard from &s;everal of them, of no &s;mall note, and great good &s;en&s;e, that a con&s;iderable time will pa&s;s before this point will be agreed upon among <HI>them:</HI> And &s;ome of my corre&s;pondents rejoice that Clementina is not married in the book; hoping that &s;he will never marry; while others expre&s;s their &s;atisfaction in the time given her, and doubt not but &s;he will. Some are plea&s;ed with the Count; others not. Some are of opinion, with Jeronymo, that her compliance with the &s;ilent wi&s;hes of her friends, when left entirely to her own will was the only duty wanting to complete her character; &s;he having voluntarily renounced, &s;o nobly as &s;he did, the only man whom &s;he preferred to <HI>him</HI> who was the choice of her parents, and given up her wi&s;hes to be allowed to take the veil.</P>
<P>Let us take a &s;urvey of what is done for the other characters.</P>
<P>No more need be &s;aid, than is, of EVERARD GRANDISON; or of Aunt ELEANOR.</P>
<P>Mr. DEANE, you &s;ee, is provided for, to his own, and every one's content.</P>
<P>So is good Dr. BARTLETT.</P>
<P>The &s;kilful LOWTHER al&s;o.</P>
<P>Sir EDW. BEAUCHAMP and EMILY are in a way to be happy.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="413">
Who can be more &s;o than Mrs. SHIRLEY? Why, Madam, would you wi&s;h to have further time taken in, to conclude a life &s;o valuable, &s;o exemplary?</P>
<P>Sir ROWLAND and Mr. FOWLER are not unhappy. They are going to Caermarthen; and you remember, Sir Rowland &s;ays, there are fine girls in Caermarthen&s;hire.</P>
<P>Mr. SELBY goes on at Selby-hou&s;e crowing over his Wife, and his Nieces; and, tho' always defeated by their good-humoured arguments, and &s;uperior &s;en&s;e, crowing on, and making all around him plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Who can be happier than Mr. and Mrs. REEVES?</P>
<P>LUCY has already her PEER.</P>
<P>I could have given NANCY SELBY to Mr. ORME; but that it is not right to put together two per&s;ons who neither of them have entire health, till they are quite recovered; and that would take up time. He, accompanied by his Si&s;ter, is a &s;econd time gone to Li&s;bon, you know. And &s;he, Emily hints, is not without her Lover.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s ORME is a good girl, and mu&s;t be happy.</P>
<P>As for GREVILLE and FENWICK, who cares for them?</P>
<P>The fate of Sir HARGRAVE, of MERCEDA, of BAGENHALL, is ab&s;olutely, and exemplarily, decided.</P>
<P>JAMES SELBY is as good as provided for: But if he had not, it would not have been much matter.</P>
<P>Lady BETTY WILLIAMS indeed, and her forward Daughter, and Mi&s;s CANTILLON, are de&s;ervedly unhappy; and there are too many of &s;uch characters, in every-body's knowlege, to require <HI>theirs</HI> to be further dwelt upon.</P>
<P>Lady BEAUCHAMP, Lady MANSFIELD and her family, Lord and Lady W. Lord and Lady L. are all happy. Lord G. al&s;o. And his CHARLOTTE is as good as <HI>&s;he</HI> can be. Her Lord wi&s;hes her not better than we leave her.</P>
<P>Sir CHARLES is the happie&s;t of men. Plans of his beneficence, oeconomy, charity, have been actually laid down.</P>
<P>His LADY is, as &s;he de&s;erves to be, the happie&s;t of women.</P>
<P>By what we have &s;een of <HI>both,</HI> we know how they will behave on every future call or occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>CLEMENTINA, let me add to the notice I have taken of her, is mi&s;tre&s;s of her own will. By the power Sir Charles, in the articles he drew, &s;tipulated for her, we know &s;he will make her&s;elf happy in acts of beneficence; and, as he has foretold, will &s;ee every-thing in a chearful light, that before appeared to her in a cloudy one. What will be the re&s;ult?</P>
<P>LAURANA has been puni&s;hed, in kind, as we may &s;ay.</P>
<P>Lady SFORZA al&s;o.</P>
<P>The MARQUIS, the MARCHIONESS, the GENERAL, the BISHOP, in &s;hort, the whole <HI>Porretta family,</HI> are happy to the extent of their wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Mrs. BEAUMONT is highly &s;o in the general felicity.</P>
<P>So is Father MARESCOTTI.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="414">
Should the &s;tory, which were it prolonged to do every-thing that &s;eems to be expected, would take up more time, though not quantity of matter, than it has already taken up, be continued for the &s;ake of OLIVIA? Surely, No.</P>
<P>Can it, then, be more happily concluded than it is?</P>
<P>As to what you are plea&s;ed to hint of the Hero's appearing to &s;hine in the parental character, have I not in PAMELA entered into that &s;ubject pretty largely? And have I not in this hi&s;tory avoided touching upon the &s;ame topics that I have treated on in either of the two former?</P>
<P>But you will be apt to &s;ay, You expected more on the&s;e &s;ub|jects from Sir Charles's character, than from that of Mr. B. or even of his Pamela.</P>
<P>But (to &s;ay nothing of his care for the education of his Father's natural children by Mrs. Oldham) &s;ee we not, from his tenderne&s;s to Mrs. Reeves's little boy; from his goodne&s;s to Lady L's &s;on; and to Lady G's little girl; from the ob&s;ervation of his Lady, that the Brave are always tender and humane; from his general prudence, as well as from his own duty to a blameable Father, who&s;e failings he occa&s;ionally deplored with a piety worthy of him&s;elf; that he would have &s;hone in every part of the parental character? [Who ever knew a dutiful Son that made not a good Father?] And where, and at what age of his children, had I entered into &s;uch par|ticulars, &s;hould I have been allowed to &s;top; &s;ince, as they grew in years, they would have had larger demands on his cares?</P>
<P>I might indeed, in what <HI>is done,</HI> have introduced a conver&s;a|tion in which the Education of Children might have been touched upon, and his opinion given: But the lovers of Story would have found fault with me for it, as they have done with the few inde|pendent conver&s;ations that appear in the book, however u&s;eful others have thought them: And be&s;ides, the occa&s;ion mu&s;t have been forced in. Nor would the &s;ubject have appeared with the requi&s;ite advantage, handled by, or before, &s;ingle men and women, or even by young married people, who had no opportunities to &s;trengthen their opinions by experience.</P>
<P>Permit me further to ob&s;erve, that the conclu&s;ion of a <HI>&s;ingle &s;tory</HI> is indeed generally &s;ome great and deci&s;ive event; as a <HI>Death,</HI> or a <HI>Marriage:</HI> But in &s;cenes of life carried down nearly to the pre&s;ent time, and in which a <HI>variety of intere&s;ting characters</HI> is introduced, all events cannot be decided, unle&s;s, as in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Tom Thumb the Great,</HI> all the actors are killed in the la&s;t &s;cene; &s;ince per&s;ons pre&s;umed to be &s;till living, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed liable to the various turns of human affairs.</P>
<P>All that can be expected therefore in &s;uch a work, if its ending is propo&s;ed to afford the mo&s;t complete &s;cene of felicity of which human life is capable, mu&s;t be to leave the principal characters happy, and the re&s;t with fair pro&s;pects of being &s;o.</P>
<P>I am, however, greatly obliged to you, Madam, for having &s;o
<PB N="407" REF="415">
far intere&s;ted your&s;elf in the &s;tory, as to write to me upon it; and beg leave to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf</P>

<HEAD>ANSWER to a LETTER from a FRIEND, who had
objected to Sir CHARLES GRANDISON's Offer to allow his Daughters by
Lady CLEMENTINA, had his Marriage with her taken Effect, to be
educated Roman Catholics.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Mar. 25. 1754.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE received, my dear friend, &s;everal anonymous Letters written on the &s;ame &s;ubject with your favour before me of the 19th; finding fault with Sir Charles Grandi&s;on for his offered compromi&s;e with the friends of Clementina, in the article of Re|ligion; all of them expre&s;&s;ing, as yours does, a laudable zeal for the intere&s;ts of the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e.</P>
<P>One of the gentlemen de&s;ired an an&s;wer to what he wrote, di|recting whither it was to be &s;ent. I do not think my&s;elf at liberty to tran&s;cribe for you his Letter, though an anonymous one, and which would do credit to any writer: But as your Letter and his are in &s;ub&s;tance pretty much the &s;ame, you will allow me to hope for your attention to the extracts I &s;hall make from my an&s;wer to his; and if they are not of &s;ufficient weight with you to excu&s;e the Hero in this important article, I &s;hall be ready, at your com|mand, to re-con&s;ider it.</P>
<P>This gentleman wi&s;hes, as you do, that I had gone further into the &s;ubject: That I had expo&s;ed the iniquity of &s;uch compromi&s;es, and &s;hewn, that the &s;ouls of girls ought to be as much regarded as tho&s;e of boys; and the rather, as &s;uch &s;tipulations are now made a point in cour&s;e, in the marriage-treaties of per&s;ons of dif|ferent religions. He is &s;o good as to call for my opinion on the &s;ubject. Thus I an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Give me leave, Sir, to &s;ay, I have &s;hewn in the work, when the &s;ubject required it, that I have the honour to be of your opinion as to this compromi&s;e. I have, in Vol. iii. <HI>Octavo,</HI> p. 105, 106. made the Bi&s;hop (Clementina's Brother) thus &s;ay to Mr. Grandi&s;on, after a debate between them on the two religions; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You will call to mind, Chevalier, that <HI>your</HI> church allows of a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation out of its pale&mdash;<HI>Ours</HI> does not."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My Lord," an&s;wers the Chevalier, "our church allows not of its members indulging them&s;elves in capital errors, again&s;t conviction."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on was a young man: He pretended not to be di|ve&s;ted of pa&s;&s;ion. It was nece&s;&s;ary to let the Porretta family, and the Reader, who it was &s;uppo&s;ed, would not be unconcerned in the de&s;tiny of Clementina, &s;ee, that he was willing to make &s;ome &s;acrifices, for tho&s;e the family made, in con&s;ideration of &s;o excel|lent a creature, who had &s;uffered &s;o much, and was actually in a
<PB N="408" REF="416">
&s;tate of &s;uffering, for her Love of him. What could he do <HI>more,</HI> he a&s;ks Dr. Bartlett, than to make &s;uch an offer? He con&s;iders it as a very great conce&s;&s;ion, though he mu&s;t know, that it was, as you, Sir, ob&s;erve, a too u&s;ual one: And he tells her warme&s;t re|lations, the General in particular, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he would not have come into &s;uch a compromi&s;e, no, not in favour of a prince&s;s, in a <HI>beginning</HI> addre&s;s."</Q> And this he &s;ays in an&s;wer to the General's que&s;tion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, Chevalier, mu&s;t the poor daughters have done, that <HI>they</HI> &s;hould have been left to perdition?"</Q> And this put by that haughty man, when he knew that Mr. Grandi&s;on was of a religion which in&s;pires its profe&s;&s;ors with more charity, than does that which allows not &s;alvation out of its own pale; and the &s;ouls of who&s;e daughters therefore, in his opinion, could not be endanger'd merely by &s;uch an education.</P>
<P>Who that thinks the Porretta family bigotted, mu&s;t not have allowed <HI>them</HI> to think Mr. Grandi&s;on &s;o, had he not made &s;ome &s;uch &s;ort of conce&s;&s;ion as he expected them to make? Nay, the, actually made a much greater than <HI>be</HI> offered [The SONS of the family]; and be&s;ides, were more apprehen&s;ive of their Daugh|ter's change of religion, were the marriage to take place, than hopeful of his.</P>
<P>Some conce&s;&s;ions are expected to be made in all marriage treaties; and (contrary to what was propo&s;ed in <HI>this</HI>) greater, fre|quently, on the man's than on the woman's part; &s;ince it is under|&s;tood, that the wife is more the property of the hu&s;band, than he is hers; and he therefore in marriage makes an acqui&s;ition. Pecuniary &s;acrifices could not have affected Mr. Grandi&s;on: No|thing but what touched his principles could. This was a &s;evere trial to him. Clementina, at the time, was the only woman he could have loved. He knew not then Mi&s;s Byron: But we have rea&s;on to believe, from different parts of the &s;tory, that he thought him&s;elf not unhappy, that a marriage, to be entered into on &s;uch terms, took not effect; as well as that it was owing to Clementina her&s;elf, and not to him, that it did not; frequent as &s;uch compromi&s;es are in marriage-treaties between people of different per&s;ua&s;ions.</P>
<P>That the&s;e ob&s;ervations lie &s;cattered, as I may &s;ay, in different parts of the &s;tory, is owing, a good deal, to the manner of writing, (to the moment, as it may be called) as occa&s;ions aro&s;e in the pro|gre&s;s of the &s;tory: A manner of writing that has its conveniencies and inconveniencies. The <HI>latter,</HI> in &s;uch ca&s;es as that before us; the <HI>former,</HI> in giving opportunities to de&s;cribe the agitations that fill the heart, in the progre&s;s of a material and intere&s;ting &s;ubject, the event of which remains undecided.</P>
<P>You will be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that I had a very nice and dif|ficult ta&s;k to manage, to convince nice and delicate Ladies, who, it might be imagined, would &s;it in judgment upon the conduct of a man in a Love-ca&s;e (who was pre&s;umed to be nearly perfect, and propo&s;ed as a pattern) that a Lady &s;o excellent as Clementina; of
<PB N="409" REF="417">
&s;o high a family and fortune; all her relations adoring her; &s;o deeply in love with him; yet &s;o delicate in her whole behaviour to him; was not &s;lighted by <HI>him.</HI> What would the Ladies, and the men of gallantry, have &s;aid, had he not done all it was po&s;&s;ible for him to do, to obtain &s;o rich a prize?</P>
<P>Allow me to &s;ay, that if his di&s;tre&s;s, in different &s;cenes of the &s;tory, were duly attended to (attacked as he was on the &s;ide of his Genero&s;ity, his Compa&s;&s;ion, his Gratitude, his Love) together with his &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s in his own Religion, I pre&s;ume, that, in the whole affair between him and Clementina, he would be rather thought a confe&s;&s;or for it, than a lukewarm man in it. Be plea&s;ed to reperu&s;e what he &s;ays to Mi&s;s Byron on this &s;ubject, in the library at Colnebrook, <HI>Vol.</HI> iii. <HI>Octavo, p.</HI> 29, 30. <HI>Vol.</HI> iii. <HI>p.</HI> 189, 190. <HI>Duodecimo.</HI></P>

<P>Thus, my dear Friend, you will &s;ee, that, however u&s;ual it may be for people of different Religions, when they intermarry, to enter into compromi&s;es of this kind, they are not countenanced by the <HI>judgment</HI> of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; who con&s;idered, as the greate&s;t misfortune that could have befallen him, the &s;ituation he was in; which in a manner <HI>compelled</HI> him to make &s;ome con|ce&s;&s;ions, in compa&s;&s;ion to an excellent woman, who laboured under a di&s;order of mind on his account.</P>
<P>After all, if this conce&s;&s;ion of Sir Charles is to be deemed a blemi&s;h, it is rather a blemi&s;h in his conduct than in his character. Very few in <HI>his</HI> circum&s;tances would have done better; few &s;o well: And what he offered, in &s;o <HI>peculiar</HI> a &s;ituation, is by no means a precedent to be pleaded in <HI>common</HI> ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Believe me to be, with equal truth and affection, Sir,</P>
