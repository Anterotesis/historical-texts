<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_WERE the following &s;mall Performance an&s;werable to its De&s;ign, or the Spirit which gave Birth to it, there would require no Apology to ju&s;tify the Publi&s;hing of that to the World, which at fir&s;t was only intended for private Information: However, it is hoped that the Intention with which it was wrote, being to con|tribute to the Support of Publick Credit,

will make &s;ome Atonement for that De|ficiency, recommend it to a candid Ac|ceptance from the Publick, and obtain a Pardon for tho&s;e Mi&s;takes which may be found in it; e&s;pecially when the Reader is a&s;&s;ured, that there is no &V;n|truth de&s;ignedly advanced, and that the whole is both wrote and publi&s;hed without the Direction, Privity, or A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of any Per&s;on what&s;oever, but the Author.</P>

<P>_THE calamitous Circum&s;tances in which too many are invol|ved, from the pre&s;ent langui&s;h|ing State of Publick Credit, is a Matter of too great Impor|tance to be pa&s;s'd by unregarded: It calls upon every Per&s;on who bears any Regard to the Intere&s;t of his Country, to exert him&s;elf in the Support of that Credit wherein no <HI>Briton</HI> can be unconcerned.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="7">The De&s;ign of the few following Leaves is not to reflect but to examine, not to flat|ter but to &s;tate, not to aggravate but to reconcile every Man to his own Intere&s;t; by making an impartial and fair Examina|tion into the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Scheme, and endea|vouring to demon&s;trate the Rea&s;onablene&s;s thereof, after the be&s;t Manner which a Per|&s;on furni&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d only with &s;uch Materials as have been publi&s;hed, is enabled to do.</P>

<P><PB N="6" REF="11">Here it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Capital, at pre&s;ent, does not amount to 34,689,121<HI>l.</HI> by rea&s;on the whole Debt is not &s;ub&s;cribed in; &s;o that probably there may be yet 10 Millions of Stock to di&s;po&s;e of.</P>
<P>Having thus far given &s;ome View of the Amount of the <HI>South Sea</HI> Capital, I &s;hall endeavour to demon&s;trate the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of the Terms given by the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company, as well as the Advantageou&s;ne&s;s of accepting them. To do which in the mo&s;t convincing manner, I &s;hall beg Leave to &s;et a Valuation upon the re&s;pective Funds, at the Time the Company fir&s;t began to engage to redeem them: And then &s;hew the Advantage accruing from the Exchange.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, as to the Valuation of the re|&s;pective Funds.</P>
<P>The Long Annuities never exceeded 25 Years Purcha&s;e, and were look'd upon as very dear at that Rate, it bringing but 4<HI>l. per Ann.</HI> to the Purcha&s;er.</P>
<P>The 9 <HI>per Cents,</HI> and Lottery 1710, &s;old for about 14 Years Purcha&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12">The 5 and 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Redeemables can|not be valued at above <HI>Par,</HI> as they were liable to be paid off at any time without Notice. And I believe it is pretty certain, that the Proprietors of the 5<HI>l. per Cent.</HI> Funds would gladly have accepted of 4<HI>l. per Cent.</HI> rather than have been paid off.</P>
<P>If this be a fair Valuation, let us examine into the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Advantageou&s;|ne&s;s of the Terms given by the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company.</P>
<P>And Fir&s;t, Every Long Annuitant, who &s;ub&s;cribed in <HI>April</HI> la&s;t, received in Stock, Bonds and Money, after the Rate of 36&frac12; Years Purcha&s;e for an Annuity, which till then was not worth more than 25 Years Purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>In like manner, every Proprietor of the 9 <HI>per Cents,</HI> or Lottery 1710, received in Stock, Bonds, and Money, about 19&frac12; Years Purcha&s;e for what would not have &s;old for 15.</P>
<P>As to the Terms at pre&s;ent given to the 2d Sub&s;cribers, they receive in Stock after the Rate of 35&frac12; Years Purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>And the 9 <HI>per Cents,</HI> and Lottery 1710, receive in Stock about 18&frac12; Years Purcha&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="13">Every Proprietor of the Redeemables re|ceives 110<HI>l.</HI> Stock for 390<HI>l.</HI> (Intere&s;t be|ing allowed to them to <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1720.) which in Effect is taking the Stock at 354<HI>l.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"><HI>s. per Cent.</HI></P>

and their Families, while others by purcha&s;ing va&s;tly beyond what their Abili|ties could make good, are plunged into ir|retrievable Ruin.</P>
<P>But to come to the main Point, which is to endeavour to &s;hew the due Value of the Stock.</P>
<P>I hope no one will, in this Particular, too &s;trictly adhere to <HI>Hudibras</HI>'s Rule, which implies that nothing is worth more than it will bring: For at pre&s;ent it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Stock &s;ells at a Di&s;count, and below its Value.</P>
<P>For were the Stock to be &s;old only at 50<HI>l. per Cent.</HI> and every Man &s;hould determine to di&s;po&s;e of his own, it would be impo&s;&s;i|ble to find Purcha&s;ers for it; and yet the Stock in Reality would be no ways the wor&s;e for it. And to demon&s;trate this the more clearly: Suppo&s;e every Proprietor of a Landed E&s;tate &s;hould re&s;olve to &s;ell it, it would not be po&s;&s;ible among our &s;elves to find Purcha&s;ers at 3 Years Purcha&s;e for the whole: Though every Man at pre&s;ent would look upon an E&s;tate at 20 Years Purcha&s;e, as a mo&s;t extraordinary Bargain: And yet no Man thinks the wor&s;e of his E&s;tate, or would be induc'd to part with it upon &s;o &s;mall a Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="15">To judge of the real Value of the Stock, mu&s;t be by the Dividends, the Company will be able to make upon the Stock, and the Continuance of them: And I hope to make it appear, that the Stock is worth 400<HI>l. per Cent.</HI> by &s;hewing that the Company is able to divide after the Rate of 30 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon their Stock, for &s;uch a Number of Years, as will reimbur&s;e every Proprietor his full Principal and Intere&s;t for every Share purcha&s;ed at that Rate.</P>
<P>The&s;e Dividends are to be made good out of the Annual Sums payable by the Go+vernment, and out of the Profits which the Company gain or make by their Stock.</P>
<P>Their Profits ari&s;e three Ways, from the Stock already &s;old, the remaining Part to he di&s;po&s;ed of, and the Loans upon the Stock.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume it is not to be expected from a private Per&s;on to point out at what Times, in what Proportions, and at what Rates the remaining Stock &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of, that being &s;ubmitted to the Ability and Management of tho&s;e Gentlemen who&s;e P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="5+ letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> is: But this I beg leave to &s;ay, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> payable by the Govern|ment to the Company, the Profits already

<P>As for In&s;tance, every Long Annuitant &s;ub&s;cribing 100<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> upon the fir&s;t Propo&s;al receives 254<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> which if continued 14 Years, Reimbur&s;es a Principal Sum of 2500<HI>l.</HI> with Intere&s;t of 5<HI>l. per Cent.</HI> thereon: Which Sum was the ju&s;t Value or Worth of his Annuity: So that the Sub|&s;criber not only receives an annual Sum of 125<HI>l.</HI> in Lieu of 100<HI>l.</HI> but is a Gainer of 770<HI>l.</HI> Capital Stock, and 575<HI>l.</HI> in Bonds or Money, over and above the 2500<HI>l.</HI> by him &s;ub&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Upon the la&s;t Propo&s;al, every long An|nuitant receives 264<HI>l.</HI> for his &s;ub&s;cribed 100<HI>l. per Annum</HI>; which gives the like Ad|dition to his yearly Income, and will reim|bur&s;e the Sum of 2500<HI>l.</HI> with 5<HI>l. per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t in 13 Years; and he be further entitled to 88<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"><HI>l.</HI> Capital Stock without Bonds.</P>

<PB N="13" REF="18">
the Evil being from our &s;elves, mu&s;t by our &s;elves be relieved.</P>
<P>I &s;hall call upon every Body, becau&s;e no Per&s;on is unconcerned, as every one will find when 'tis too late, that does not exert him&s;elf in this Ju&s;t and National Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who enjoy Favours from the Go|vernment, are fir&s;t obliged by their Au|thority, Example and Advice to engage them&s;elves and all others over whom they have any Influence in this ju&s;t Cau&s;e. Tho&s;e who receive no particular Favours from the Government, but live in the quiet and pea|ceable Enjoyment of their own, and profe&s;s them&s;elves and would be treated as Friends to this pre&s;ent happy E&s;tabli&s;hment, ought not to be unactive for its Support, much le&s;s, if not nece&s;&s;itated, to make any De|mand to di&s;tre&s;s the Publick Credit.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e not engaged in the publick Funds, are as much concerned to &s;upport the Cre|dit of them, as tho&s;e engaged, as all will feel the good or ill Effects of their Sup|port or Decay.</P>
<P>A Decay of Credit mu&s;t unavoidably end in a Decay of Sub&s;tance. The Farmer will find no Market to take off the Produce and
<PB N="14" REF="19">
Effects of his Labour, and con&s;equently be unable to pay his Landlord. The Mer|chants will find no Demands for their Com|modities, and the indu&s;trious Manufacturer no Employment for his Hands. As the Poor will increa&s;e, the Means of relieving them will le&s;&s;en daily.</P>
<P>The&s;e are Circum&s;tances which &s;hould awaken all of us to guard again&s;t them, as they are more ea&s;y to be prevented than remedied.</P>
<P>Let us not join Hands to work out our own De&s;truction, and give up that Peace, Trade and Wealth, which the united Power and Artifices of our Enemies has hitherto in vain laboured to rob us of.</P>
<P>Let no Man through unju&s;t Fears or groundle&s;s Jealou&s;ies, lock up his Trea&s;ure in his Coffers, and boa&s;t him&s;elf upon a Security which will prove imaginary: Let every Man place his Strength in the Sup|port of the Government, and the Pro&s;pe|rity of his Country: And as there is no Attempt made to hurt us, let every Man con&s;ider where &s;uch Intere&s;t is allowed, or &s;uch Security given for Money, as in Great <HI>Britain</HI>? Where has publick Faith ever been &s;o inviolably maintained? What great|er
<PB N="15" REF="20">
Security can be de&s;ired, where all the publick Funds are appropriated, the Intere&s;t, Wealth and Credit of the whole Nation is engaged to &s;upport, as it now is by the late happy and &s;ea&s;onable Agreement be|tween the Bank of <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company?</P>
<P>Upon the whole, as we are ble&s;&s;ed with a wi&s;e and good Prince, a faithfull and able Mini&s;try, and a Parliament capable and di&s;po&s;ed to concert &s;uch Mea&s;ures as tend to the common Intere&s;t of all: Let us join our Endeavours to their Re&s;olutions, to re|trieve the Difficulties we labour under; then will our Credit &s;oon revive, our Trade flou|ri&s;h, and we become a great, happy and powerful People to all &s;ucceeding Ge|nerations.</P>
