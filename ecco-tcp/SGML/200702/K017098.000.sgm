<HEAD>A Short ACCOUNT OF A Late Short ADMINISTRATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE late Admini&s;tration came into Employment, under the Mediation of the Duke of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> on the Tenth Day of <HI>July</HI> 1765; and was re|moved, upon a Plan &s;ettled by the Earl of <HI>Chatham</HI> on the Thirtieth Day of <HI>July</HI> 1766, having la&s;ted ju&s;t One Year and Twenty Days.</P>
<P>In that Space of Time</P>
<P>The Di&s;tractions of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire were compo&s;ed, by <HI>The Repeal of the American Stamp Act</HI>;</P>
<P>But the Con&s;titutional Superiority of <HI>Great Britain</HI> was pre&s;erved, by <HI>The Act for &s;ecuring the Dependance of the Co|lonies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Private</HI> Hou&s;es were relieved from the Juri&s;diction of the Exci&s;e, by <HI>The Repeal of the Cyder Tax.</HI></P>
<P>The per&s;onal Liberty of the Subject was confirmed, by <HI>The Re&s;olution again&s;t General Warrants.</HI></P>
<P>The lawful Secrets of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Friend&s;hip were ren|dered inviolable by <HI>The Re&s;olution for condemning the Seizure of Papers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">The Trade of <HI>America</HI> was &s;et free from injudicious and ruinous Impo&s;itions &mdash; Its Revenue was improved, and &s;ettled upon a rational Foundation &mdash; Its Commerce extended with foreign Countries; while all the Advantages were &s;ecured to Great Britain, by <HI>The Act for repealing certain Duties, and encouraging, regulating, and &s;ecuring the Trade of this Kingdom, and the Briti&s;h Dominions in America.</HI></P>
<P>Materials were provided and in&s;ured to our Manufactures&mdash; The Sale of the&s;e Manufactures was encrea&s;ed&mdash;The <HI>African</HI> Trade pre&s;erved and extended &mdash; The Principles of the Act of Navigation pur&s;ued, and the Plan improved &mdash; And the Trade for Bullion rendered free, &s;ecure, and permanent, by <HI>The Act for opening certain Ports in Dominica and Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>That Admini&s;tration was the fir&s;t which propo&s;ed, and en|couraged public Meetings, and free Con&s;ultations of Merchants from all Parts of the Kingdom; by which Means the true&s;t Lights have been received; great Benefits have been al|ready derived to Manufacture and Commerce; and the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Pro&s;pects are open'd for further Improvement.</P>
<P>Under them, the Intere&s;ts of our Northern and Southern Colonies, before that Time jarring and di&s;&s;onant, were un|der&s;tood, compared, adju&s;ted, and perfectly reconciled. The Pa&s;&s;ions and Animo&s;ities of the Colonies, by judicious and lenient Mea&s;ures, were allayed and compo&s;ed, and the Foundation laid for a la&s;ting Agreement among&s;t them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">Whil&s;t that Admini&s;tration provided for the Liberty and Commerce of their Country, as the true Ba&s;is of its Power, they con&s;ulted its Intere&s;ts, they a&s;&s;erted its Honour Abroad, with Temper and with Firmne&s;s; by making an advan|tageous Treaty of Commerce with <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI>; by obtaining a Liquidation of the <HI>Canada</HI> Bills, to the Satisfaction of the Proprietors; by reviving and rai&s;ing from its A&s;hes the Nego|tiation for the <HI>Manilla</HI> Ran&s;om, which had been extingui&s;hed and abandoned by their Predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>They treated their Sovereign with Decency; with Re|verence. They di&s;countenanced, and, it is hoped, for ever aboli&s;hed the dangerous and uncon&s;titutional Practice of re|moving military Officers for their Votes in Parliament. They firmly adhered to tho&s;e Friends of Liberty, who had run all Hazards in its Cau&s;e, and provided for them in preference to every other Claim.</P>
<P>With the Earl of <HI>Bute</HI> they had no per&s;onal Connection; no Corre&s;pondence of Councils. They neither courted him nor per&s;ecuted him. They practi&s;ed no Corruption; nor were they even &s;u&s;pected of it. They &s;old no Offices. They ob|tained no Rever&s;ions or Pen&s;ions, either coming in or going out, for them&s;elves, their Families, or their Dependants.</P>
<P>In the Pro&s;ecution of their Mea&s;ures they were tra|ver&s;ed by an Oppo&s;ition of a new and &s;ingular Character; an Oppo&s;ition of Place-men and Pen&s;ioners. They were &s;up|ported by the Confidence of the Nation. And having held their Offices under many Difficulties and Di&s;couragements,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
they left them at the expre&s;s Command, as they had ac|cepted them at the earne&s;t Reque&s;t of their Royal Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The&s;e are plain Facts; of a clear and public Nature; nei|ther extended by elaborate Rea&s;oning, or heightened by the Colouring of Eloquence. They are the Services of a &s;ingle Year.</P>
<P>The Removal of that Admini&s;tration from Power, is not to them premature; &s;ince they were in Office long enough to accompli&s;h many Plans of public Utility; and by their Per&s;everance and Re&s;olution, rendered the Way &s;mooth and ea&s;y to their Succe&s;&s;ors; having left their King and their Country in a much better Condition than they found them. By the Temper they manife&s;t, they &s;eem to have now no other Wi&s;h, than that their Succe&s;&s;ors may do the Pub|lic as real and as faithful Service as they have done.</P>
