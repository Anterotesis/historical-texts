<HEAD>CHAP. I. The Occa&s;ion of the Law-Suit.</HEAD>
<P>I Need not tell you of the great Quarrels that have
happen'd in our Neighbourhood, &s;ince the Death
of the late Lord <HI>Strutt;</HI> how the Par&s;on and a
cunning Attorney got him to &s;ettle his E&s;tate upon
his Cou&s;in <HI>Philip Baboon,</HI> to the great di&s;appoint|ment

that the Par&s;on and the Attorney forg'd a Will, for
which they were well Paid by the Family of the <HI>Ba|boons:</HI>
Let that be as it will, it is matter of Fact, that
the Honour and E&s;tate have continued ever &s;ince in the
Per&s;on of <HI>Philip Baboon.</HI></P>
<P>You know that the Lord <HI>Strutts</HI> have for many Years
been po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a very great Landed E&s;tate, well con|dition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d,
wooded, water<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d, with Coal, Salt, Tin, Cop|per,
Iron, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all within them&s;elves; that it has been
the Misfortune of that Family, to be the Property of
their Stewards, Trade&s;men, and inferior Servants, which
has brought great Incumbrances upon them; at the
&s;ame time not abating of their expen&s;ive way of Living,
has forc'd them to Mortgage their be&s;t Manors: It is
credibly reported, that the Butchers and Bakers Bills
of a Lord <HI>Strutt</HI> that lived Two hundred Years ago&punc;
are not yet paid.</P>
<P>When <HI>Philip Baboon</HI> came fir&s;t to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
Lord <HI>Strutt</HI>'s E&s;tate, his Trade&s;men as is u&s;ual upon
&s;uch Occa&s;ions, waited upon him to wi&s;h him Joy, and
be&s;peak his Cu&s;tom: The two chief were <HI>John Bull</HI> the
Clothier, and <HI>Nic. Frog</HI> the Linnen-draper; they told
him, that the <HI>Bulls</HI> and <HI>Frogs</HI> had &s;erv'd the Lord <HI>Strutts</HI>
with Drapery Ware for many Years; that they were
hone&s;t and fair Dealers; that their Bills had never been
que&s;tion'd; that the Lord <HI>Strutts</HI> lived generou&s;ly, and
never us'd to dirty their Fingers with Pen, Ink, and
Counters; that his Lord&s;hip might depend upon their
Hone&s;ty, that they would u&s;e him as kindly as they had

<HEAD>CHAP. V. The true Characters of John Bull, Nic. Frog, and Hocus.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the better under&s;tanding the following Hi&s;tory,
the Reader ought to know, That <HI>Bull,</HI> in the
main, was an hone&s;t plain-dealing Fellow, Chole|rick,
Bold, and of a very uncon&s;tant Temper; he dreaded
not Old <HI>Lewis</HI> either at Back-Sword, &s;ingle Fauchion,
or Cudgel-play; but then he was very apt to quarrel
with his be&s;t Friends, e&s;pecially if they pretended to
govern him: If you f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">atter'd him&punc; you might lead him
like a Child. <HI>John</HI>'s Temper depended very much up|on

the Air; his Spirits ro&s;e and fell with the Weather-gla&s;s.
<HI>John</HI> was quick, and under&s;tood his Bu&s;ine&s;s very well, but
no Man alive was more carele&s;s, in looking into his Ac|counts,
or more cheated by Partners, Apprentices, and
Servants: This was occa&s;ioned by his being a Boon-Com|panion,
loving his Bottle and his Diver&s;ion; for to &s;ay
Truth, no Man kept a better Hou&s;e than <HI>John,</HI> nor &s;pent
his Money more generou&s;ly. By plain and fair dealing,
<HI>John</HI> had acquir'd &s;ome Plumbs, and might have kept them,
had it not been for his unhappy Law-Suit.</P>
<P><HI>Nic. Frog</HI> was a cunning fly Whore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">on, quite the rever&s;e

never lo&s;t a Farthing by carele&s;s Servants, or bad Debtors:

<P><HI>LAW is a Bottomle&s;s Pit, it is a Cormorant, a Harpy that

and to &s;ay Truth, <HI>John</HI> did not &s;tarve the Cau&s;e:
there wanted not <HI>Tellow Boys</HI> to &s;ee Coun&s;el, hire Wit|ne&s;&s;es,

<PB REF="8">

That the next would be the final Determination;
but alas! that final Determination, and happy Conclu&s;ion
was like an inchanted I&s;land, the nearer <HI>John</HI> came to it,
the further it went from him: New Tryals upon new

he tore off their Cloaths: Now and then you
would &s;ee them come home naked, without Shoes

Signior <HI>Cavallo</HI> judged it was high time for him to inter|po&s;e,
he bragged that he had an infallible Ointment and
Plai&s;ter, which being applied to the Sore would Cure
it in a few Days; at the &s;ame time he would give her
a Pill that would purge off all her bad Humours, &s;weeten

Salve, &s;ays he; and give her a plentiful Draught of my

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. How the Lawyers agreed to &s;end Don Diego Di&s;mallo, the

<P>HOw does my good Friend <HI>Don Diego?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Don.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never wor&s;e Who can be ea&s;ie when
their Friends are playing the Fool?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bull.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then you may be ea&s;ie, for I am re&s;olv'd to
play the Fool no longer: I wi&s;h I had hearken'd to your
Advice, and compounded this Law Suit &s;ooner.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Don.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true; I was then again&s;t the ruinous ways of
this Law Suit, but looking over my Scheme &s;ince, I find
there is an Error in my Calculation. <HI>Sol</HI> and <HI>Jupiter</HI>
were in a wrong Hou&s;e, but I have now di&s;cover'd
their true Places: I tell you I find that the Stars are
unanimou&s;ly of Opinion, that you will be &s;ucce&s;sful in this
Cau&s;e; That <HI>Lewis</HI> will come to an untimely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">,
and <HI>Strutt</HI> will be turn'd out of Doors by his Wife and
Children. Then he went on with a Torrent of Eclyp|ticks,
Cycles Epicycles, A&s;cendants, Trines, Quadrants,
Conjunctions Bulls, Bears, Goats, and Rams, and abun|dance
of hard Words, which being, put together, &s;ignify'd
nothing. <HI>John</HI> all this while &s;tood gaping and &s;taring,
like a Man in a Trance.</P>
