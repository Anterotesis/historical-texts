<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Am, by Profe&s;&s;ion, no Poet, Yet, having a Son, of my own, at this Time, of no &s;mall Hope, in one of our famous Univer&s;ities; I cannot, therefore, be &s;uppos'd to want Reverence for tho&s;e Seminaries of the Mu&s;es: Upon this Account partly (for, of It&s;elf, I have no great Opinion of Poetry) but, perceiving, at the Head of the Manu&s;cript, that it had been written by a <HI>Fellow of All-Souls;</HI> and chiefly, invited by &s;ome encour|aging Expre&s;&s;ions, in the Beginning, alluding to a Chariot, that could carry a Man up to the Stars, I be&s;tow'd a &s;erious Peru&s;al on the Ver|&s;es, which I, herewith, publi&s;h; and which I found one rainy Day, at the Bottom of a
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
Hackney-Coach; where, I &s;uppo&s;e, they might have been dropt, by Somebody, who had been in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Coach, before me.</P>
<P>But, I confe&s;s, the oftner I perus'd the Ma|nu&s;cript, the le&s;s I was able to comprehend of its Meaning; I had not, indeed, labour'd far in the Matter, before I di&s;covered, that the Au|thor, notwith&s;tanding he has been plea&s;ed to make free with the <HI>Stars,</HI> is a <HI>Novice</HI> in <HI>our Science;&mdash;</HI> &s;o that what he writes, con|cerning the <HI>Thinne&s;s of Heaven's Purlieus;&mdash;&s;urmounting the Stars in a Chariot of Air,</HI> and &s;uch like promi&s;ing Conceptions, ought not (I believe) to be taken in the &s;trict Sen&s;e of the Phra&s;e, but only for a Joke, or a Fancy;&mdash;However, &s;ome of my Profe&s;&s;ion, to whom I &s;hew'd it, agreed, that it was a dark Piece of Work, had more in it, than <HI>Satire;</HI> and, for any thing They, or I, knew to the contrary, might be Matter of Danger to the Government, and ought to be carried to the Secretary's Office.</P>
<P>By a Mind, laudably filled with a Zeal for his Country's Safety, every Hint, that infers its Danger, &s;hould be thought of the utmo&s;t Importance; To the Secretary's Office, therefore, I went with it, and put it into the Hands of one, who appear'd to think Him&s;elf more con&s;i|derable, than any Body, I cou'd &s;ee about him; I begg'd the Favour, that he would look it over, and give me his Opinion, whether it was a trea&s;onable Libel: I would not, willingly, do

<P>He ask'd me, whether I did not plainly di&s;cern, what great Man, in a certain A&s;&s;em|bly, was pointed at, under this Image of a <HI>dark, bu&s;tling, Power, ob&s;curely &s;een;</HI> upon which, recollecting my&s;elf, as became me, and pondering the Words, to the be&s;t of my Capa|city, I reply'd, I thought it was the <HI>Devil.&mdash;</HI> He &s;hook his Head, and inform'd me, civilly, that I was, <HI>a little,</HI> mi&s;taken; but perceiving me, in &s;ome mea&s;ure aba&s;h'd, he a&s;&s;ur'd me, it was &s;o natural an Error, that any Body might have fallen into it, as well as I: Then proceeded to convince me, that <HI>&s;hining Sand</HI> was a <HI>Cant-Word</HI> for <HI>Mo|ney Bags;</HI> that by the Boats &s;aid to be di&s;tri|buted, at Random, by the Bounty of the blind Power, that was &s;o bu&s;y in Darkne&s;s, was to be under&s;tood, tho&s;e <HI>Gratifications,</HI> impudently call'd <HI>Pen&s;ions,</HI> by Per&s;ons di&s;affected to the Mini&s;try; That, for Example, the large&s;t of &s;uch pretended Pen&s;ions were repre&s;ented, under the Similitude of <HI>Boats which had Sails, and Oars, together:&mdash;</HI> Middling Pen&s;ions, were <HI>Boats with many Oars:&mdash;</HI> Smaller &s;till, were <HI>One-Oar'd Barks:&mdash;</HI> The lea&s;t of all, were <HI>Pole-men:&mdash;</HI> And as for the <HI>naked Waders,</HI> it was, by this Time, become

<P>My ingenious Friend the Lawyer, advis'd me to write a Letter, to the Great Man, who had made &s;o light of a good Subject's Informa|tion, and put him in Mind of the Fate of <HI>Philotas.&mdash;</HI> He added, that the Fears of State&s;men would be more awake, for their Ma&s;ters, if le&s;s watchful for Them&s;elves: He was &s;orry, he was, then, in Ha&s;te, but invi|ted me next Morning to his Chambers, where he a&s;&s;ured me, no A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in his Power, &s;hould be wanting, to <HI>make &s;omething</HI> of the Matter, we had been conferring on.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honour'd Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am &s;orry to &s;ay, I was a&s;ham'd of your Account, concerning the Manu&s;cript, you demand my Thoughts of; It is no other, than a <HI>Satire,</HI> written, by <HI>One</HI> Poet, on the Mi&s;application of <HI>Another's</HI> Genius;&mdash;You apprehended it to mean <HI>more,</HI> than the Author de&s;ign'd, by finding it &s;ay <HI>le&s;s,</HI> than the Reader expected; But Scurrility, and Gro&s;sne&s;s, are &s;o far from being <HI>Requi&s;ites</HI> in <HI>Satire,</HI> that it can be no <HI>true Satire,</HI> in which they are to be met with. The Force of the&s;e Writings con&s;i&s;ts, in their <HI>Smiling;</HI> and whenever they grow <HI>angry,</HI> they bring a Storm over their own Sun&s;hine; which, like the Frown of incens'd Beauty, lo&s;es more, by Abatement of Influence, than is gain'd, from Acce&s;&s;ion of Rigour.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="10">
The <HI>Pope,</HI> at the End of the Poem, ought to give you no Jealou&s;y: He is none of his <HI>Holyne&s;s,</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> but an <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> (I had almo&s;t &s;aid, <HI>Prote&s;tant) Pope,</HI> of this Nation's own Breeding; He wears, indeed, a <HI>Triple Crown,</HI> like the other, but it is of <HI>Mu&s;ick, Painting,</HI> and <HI>Poetry.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing is more ea&s;ily perceived, than, that this Satire is the Con&s;equence of &s;ome Pieces, lately publi&s;h'd, which &s;avour, to &s;ay Truth, of a Sen&s;ibility, too like <HI>Levity,</HI> in a Mind, &s;o rich, as His, who is reputed their Author; But I cannot, without Plea|&s;ure, ob&s;erve the Influence of acknowledg'd Merit confining Satire to his <HI>Folly,</HI> without allowing it to attack his <HI>Wit;</HI> which is not weaker, tho' le&s;s lovely, when it &s;tains it&s;elf upon a dirty Subject, than, when it orna|ments Beauty it&s;elf, and adds Magnificence to Palaces.</P>
<P>It is an <HI>Art</HI> to <HI>trifle, importantly;</HI> and even to <HI>trifle, agreeably,</HI> has its Attra|ction: But to trifle, un&s;ea&s;onably, indecently or improperly, let who will be the Trifler, mu&s;t be, either, inhumane, or unguarded&mdash;Either wrong Judgment, or Ill-breeding.</P>
<P>What Pity, that the warme&s;t of a certain Gentleman's Admirers are, lately, forc'd to confe&s;s, there are <HI>Gro&s;sne&s;&s;es,</HI> in &s;ome of his Sallies, ob&s;cene enough to blot out any Wit, but their Author's! <HI>In&s;ults,</HI> low enough to be|come the mo&s;t vulgar-&s;pirited among his Ene|mies:
<PB N="xiii" REF="11">
And <HI>Malice,</HI> animated enough to be beautiful, in any of his Friends, but Him&s;elf!</P>
<P>It gives, however, a Kind of ill-natur'd Comfort to us, who are his <HI>di&s;tant Cotem|poraries,</HI> that among Virtues, which we mu&s;t de&s;pair of equalling, we di&s;cover Er|rors, which we di&s;dain to imitate.&mdash;So, pray, Sir, commit the Poem to the Pre&s;s, and let it travel, in Search of its Author, who will, hardly, look for it in <HI>Your</HI> Hands, and, by that Means, it may be lo&s;t to the Publick.</P>
