<P>THE following Letter appears to have been written about the Year 1748, and the Per&s;on to whom it is ad|dre&s;&s;ed need not be pointed out. As it is probable the Noble Writer had no De|&s;ign that it &s;hould ever appear in Publick, this will account for his having kept no Copy of it, and con&s;equently, for it's not appearing among&s;t the re&s;t of his Works. By what Means it came into the Hands of the Editor, is not at all material to the Publick, any farther than as &s;uch an Ac|count might tend to authenticate the Ge|nuinene&s;s of it, and for this it was thought it might &s;afely rely on it's own internal Evidence.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER TO LORD ****</HEAD>
<P>SHALL I venture to &s;ay, my LORD, that in our late Conver&s;ation, you were inclined to the Party which you adopted rather by the Feelings of your good Nature, than by the Conviction of your Judgment? We laid open the Foun|dations of Society; and you feared, that the Curio&s;ity of this Search might en|danger the Ruin of the whole Fabrick. You would readily have allowed my Prin|ciple, but you dreaded the Con&s;equences; you thought, that having once entered upon
<PB N="2" REF="4">
the&s;e Rea&s;onings, we might be carried in|&s;en&s;ibly and irre&s;i&s;tably farther than at fir&s;t we could either have imagined or wi&s;hed. But for my part, my LORD, I then thought, and am &s;till of the &s;ame Opinion, that Er|ror, and not Truth of any Kind, is danger|ous; that ill Conclu&s;ions can only flow from fal&s;e Propo&s;itions; and that, to know whether any Propo&s;ition be true or fal&s;e, it is a prepo&s;terous Method to examine it by it's apparent Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the Rea&s;ons which induced me to go &s;o far into that Enquiry; and they are the Rea&s;ons which direct me in all my Enquiries. I had indeed often reflected on that Subject before I could prevail upon my&s;elf to communicate my Reflections to any body. They were generally melan|choly enough; as tho&s;e u&s;ually are which carry us beyond the mere Surface of Things; and which would undoubtedly make the Lives of all thinking Men ex|tremely mi&s;erable, if the &s;ame Philo&s;ophy
<PB N="3" REF="5">
which cau&s;ed the Grief, did not at the &s;ame Time admini&s;ter the Comfort.</P>
<P>On con&s;idering political Societies, their Origin, their Con&s;titution, and their Ef|fects, I have &s;ometimes been in a good deal more than Doubt, whether the Crea|tor did ever really intend Man for a State of Happine&s;s. He has mixed in his Cup a Number of natural Evils, (in Spite of the Boa&s;ts of Stoici&s;m they are Evils) and every Endeavour which the Art and Po|licy of Mankind has u&s;ed from the Begin|ning of the World to this Day, in order to alleviate, or cure them, has only &s;erved to introduce new Mi&s;chiefs, or to aggravate and inflame the old. Be&s;ides this, the Mind of Man it&s;elf is too active and re&s;tle&s;s a Principle ever to &s;ettle on the true Point of Quiet. It di&s;covers every Day &s;ome craving Want in a Body, which really wants but little. It every Day invents &s;ome new artificial Rule to guide that Nature which if left to it&s;elf were the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="6">
Guide. It finds out imaginary Beings pre|&s;cribing imaginary Laws; and then, it rai&s;es imaginary Terrors to &s;upport a Be|lief in the Beings, and an Obedience to the Laws. Many Things have been &s;aid, and very well undoubtedly, on the Subjection in which we &s;hould pre&s;erve our Bodies to the Government of our Under&s;tanding; but enough has not been &s;aid upon the Re|&s;traint which our bodily Nece&s;&s;ities ought to lay on the extravagant Sublimities, and excentrick Rovings of our Minds. The Body, or as &s;ome love to call it, our infe|rior Nature, is wi&s;er in it's own plain Way, and attends it's own Bu&s;ine&s;s more directly than the Mind with all it's boa&s;ted Subtilty.</P>
<P>In the State of Nature, without Que&s;|tion, Mankind was &s;ubjected to many and great Inconveniencies. Want of Union, Want of mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance, Want of a common Arbitrator to re&s;ort to in their Differences. The&s;e were Evils which they
<PB N="5" REF="7">
could not but have felt pretty &s;everely on many Occa&s;ions. The original Children of the Earth lived with their Brethren of the other Kinds in much Equality. Their Diet mu&s;t have been confined almo&s;t wholly to the vegetable Kind; and the &s;ame Tree, which in it's flouri&s;hing State produced them Berries, in it's Decay gave them an Habitation. The mutual De&s;ires of the Sexes uniting their Bodies and Affections, the Children, which were the Re&s;ults of the&s;e Intercour&s;es, intro|duced fir&s;t the Notion of Society, and taught it's Conveniences. This Society, founded in natural Appetites and In&s;tincts, and not in any po&s;itive In&s;titution; I &s;hall call <HI>Natural Society.</HI> Thus far Nature went, and &s;ucceeded; but Man would go farther. The great Error of our Nature is, not to know where to &s;top, not to be &s;atisfied with any rea&s;onable Acquirement; not to compound with our Condition; but to lo&s;e all we have gained by an in&s;a|tiable Pur&s;uit after more. Man found a con|&s;iderable
<PB N="6" REF="8">
Advantage by this Union of ma|ny Per&s;ons to form one Family; he there|fore judged that he would find his Account proportionably in an Union of many Fa|milies into one Body politick. And as Na|ture has formed no Bond of Union to hold them together, he &s;upplied this Defect by <HI>Laws.</HI></P>
<P>This is <HI>Political Society.</HI> And hence the Sources of what are u&s;ually called States, civil Societies, or Governments; into &s;ome Form of which, more extended or re&s;trained, all Mankind have gradually fallen. And &s;ince it has &s;o happened, and that we owe an implicit Reverence to all the In&s;titutions of our Ance&s;tors, we &s;hall con&s;ider the&s;e In&s;titutions with all that Mode&s;ty with which we ought to conduct our&s;elves in examining a received Opinion; but with all that Freedom and Candour which we owe to Truth wherever we find it, or however it may contradict our own Notions, or oppo&s;e our own Intere&s;ts.
<PB N="7" REF="9">
There is a mo&s;t ab&s;urd and audacious Me|thod of rea&s;oning avowed by &s;ome Bigots and Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and through Fear a&s;&s;ented to by &s;ome wi&s;er and better Men; it is this. They argue again&s;t a fair Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of popular Prejudices, becau&s;e, &s;ay they, tho' they would be found without any rea&s;onable Support, yet the Di&s;covery might be productive of the mo&s;t danger|ous Con&s;equences. Ab&s;urd and bla&s;phe|mous Notion! as if all Happine&s;s was not connected with the Practice of Virtue, which nece&s;&s;arily depends upon the Know|ledge of Truth; that is, upon the Know|ledge of tho&s;e unalterable Relations which Providence has ordained that every thing &s;hould bear to every other. The&s;e Rela|tions, which are Truth it&s;elf, the Founda|tion of Virtue, and con&s;equently, the only Mea&s;ures of Happine&s;s, &s;hould be likewi&s;e the only Mea&s;ures by which we &s;hould direct our Rea&s;oning. To the&s;e we &s;hould conform in good Earne&s;t; and not think to force Nature, and the whole Order of
<PB N="8" REF="10">
her Sy&s;tem, by a Compliance with our Pride, and Folly, to conform to our arti|ficial Regulations. It is by a Conformity to this Method we owe the Di&s;covery of the few Truths we know, and the little Liberty and rational Happine&s;s we enjoy. We have &s;omething fairer Play than a Rea&s;oner could have expected formerly; and we derive Advantages from it which are very vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>The Fabrick of Super&s;tition has in this our Age and Nation received much ruder Shocks than it had ever felt before; and through the Chinks and Breaches of our Pri&s;on, we &s;ee &s;uch Glimmerings of Light, and feel &s;uch refre&s;hing Airs of Liberty, as daily rai&s;e our Ardor for more. The Mi|&s;eries derived to Mankind from Super&s;ti|tion, under the Name of Religion, and of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Tyranny under the Name of Church Government, have been clearly and u&s;efully expo&s;ed. We begin to think and to act from Rea&s;on and from Nature
<PB N="9" REF="11">
alone. This is true of &s;everal, but &s;till is by far the Majority in the &s;ame old State of Blindne&s;s and Slavery; and much is it to be feared that we &s;hall perpetually re|lap&s;e, whil&s;t the real productive Cau&s;e of all this &s;uper&s;titious Folly, enthu&s;ia&s;tical Non&s;en&s;e, and holy Tyranny, holds a re|verend Place in the E&s;timation even of tho&s;e who are otherwi&s;e enlightened.</P>
<P>Civil Government borrows a Strength from eccle&s;ia&s;tical; and artificial Laws re|ceive a Sanction from artificial Revelations. The Ideas of Religion and Government are clo&s;ely connected; and whil&s;t we re|ceive Government as a Thing nece&s;&s;ary, or even u&s;eful to our well-being, we &s;hall in &s;pite of us draw in, as a nece&s;&s;ary, tho' unde&s;irable Con&s;equence, an artificial Re|ligion of &s;ome Kind or other. To this the Vulgar will always be voluntary Slaves; and even tho&s;e of a Rank of Under&s;tanding &s;uperior, will now and then involuntarily feel it's Influence. It is therefore of the
<PB N="10" REF="12">
deepe&s;t Concernment to us to be &s;et right in this Point; and to be well &s;atisfied whether civil Government be &s;uch a Pro|tector from natural Evils, and &s;uch a Nur&s;e and Increa&s;er of Ble&s;&s;ings, as tho&s;e of warm Imaginations promi&s;e. In &s;uch a Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, far am I from propo&s;ing in the lea&s;t to reflect on our mo&s;t wi&s;e Form of Government; no more than I would in the freer Parts of my philo&s;ophical Writ|ings, mean to object to the Piety, Truth and Perfection of our mo&s;t excellent Church. Both I am &s;en&s;ible have their Foundations on a Rock. No Di&s;covery of Truth can prejudice them. On the contrary, the more clo&s;ely the Origin of Religion and Government are examined, the more clearly their Excellencies mu&s;t appear. They come purified from the Fire. My Bu&s;ine&s;s is not with them. Having entered a Prote&s;t again&s;t all Objec|tions from the&s;e Quarters, I may the more freely enquire from Hi&s;tory and Experi|ence, how far Policy has contributed in
<PB N="11" REF="13">
all Times to alleviate tho&s;e Evils which Providence, that perhaps has de&s;igned us for a State of Imperfection, has impo&s;ed; how far our phy&s;ical Skill has cured our con&s;titutional Di&s;orders; and whether, it may not have introduced new ones, cure|able perhaps by no Skill.</P>
<P>In looking over any State to form a Judgment on it; it pre&s;ents it&s;elf in two Lights, the external and the internal. The fir&s;t, that Relation which it bears in Point of Friend&s;hip or Enmity to other States. The &s;econd, that Relation it's component Parts, the governing, and the governed, bear to each other. The fir&s;t Part of the external View of all States, their Relation as Friends, makes &s;o trifling a Figure in Hi&s;tory, that I am very &s;orry to &s;ay, it af|fords me but little Matter on which to expatiate. The good Offices done by one Nation to it's Neighbour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Had his Lord&s;hip lived to our Days, to have &s;een the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ble Relief given by this Nation to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> he had perhaps owned this Part of his Argument a little weakened, but we do not think our&s;elves intitled to alter his Lord&s;hip's Words, but that we are bound to follow him exactly.</NOTE>; the Support
<PB N="12" REF="14">
given in publick Di&s;tre&s;s; the Relief af|forded in general Calamity; the Protection granted in emergent Danger; the mutual Return of Kindne&s;s and Civility, would afford a very ample and very plea&s;ing Sub|ject for Hi&s;tory. But alas! all the Hi&s;|tory of all Times, concerning all Nations, does not afford Matter enough to fill ten Pages, though it &s;hould be &s;pun out by the Wire-drawing Amplification of a <HI>Guicciardini</HI> him&s;elf. The glaring Side is that of Enmity. War is the Matter which fills all Hi&s;tory, and con&s;equently the only, or almo&s;t the only View in which we can &s;ee the external of political Society, is in a ho&s;tile Shape; and the only Actions, to which we have always &s;een, and &s;till &s;ee all of them intent, are &s;uch, as tend to the De&s;truction of one an|other. War, &s;ays <HI>Machiavell,</HI> ought to be the only Study of a Prince; and by a Prince,
<PB N="13" REF="15">
he means every &s;ort of State however con|&s;tituted. He ought, &s;ays this great poli|tical Doctor, only con&s;ider Peace as a breathing Time, which gives him Lei&s;ure to contrive, and furni&s;hes Ability to exe|cute military Plans. A Meditation on the Conduct of political Societies made old <HI>Hobbes</HI> imagine, that War was the State of Nature; and truly, if a Man judged of the Individuals of our Race by their Con|duct when united and packed into Na|tions and Kingdoms, he might imagine that every &s;ort of Virtue was unnatural and foreign to the Mind of Man.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Accounts we have of Mankind are but Accounts of their Butcheries of each other. All Empires have been ce|mented in Blood; and in tho&s;e early Pe|riods when the Race of Mankind began fir&s;t to form them&s;elves into Parties and Combinations, the fir&s;t Effect of the Com|bination, and indeed the End for which it &s;eems purpo&s;ely formed, and be&s;t calcu|lated,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
is their mutual De&s;truction. All antient Hi&s;tory is dark and uncertain. One thing however is clear. There were Con|querors, and Conque&s;ts, in tho&s;e Days; and con&s;equently, all that Deva&s;tation, by which they are formed, and all that Oppre&s;&s;ion by which they are maintained. We know little of <HI>Se&s;o&s;tris,</HI> but that he led out of <HI>Egypt</HI> an Army of above 700,000 Men; that he overran the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Coa&s;t as far as <HI>Colchis,</HI> that in &s;ome Places, he met but little Re&s;i&s;tance, and of cour&s;e &s;hed not a great deal of Blood; but that he found in others, a People who knew the Value of their Liberties, and &s;old them dear. Whoever con&s;iders the Army this Conqueror headed, the Space he traver&s;ed, and the Oppo&s;ition he frequently met; with the natural Accidents of Sickne&s;s, and the Dearth and Badne&s;s of Provi&s;ion he mu&s;t have been &s;ubject to in the Va|riety of Climates and Countries his March lay through, if he knows any thing, he mu&s;t know, that even the Conqueror's
<PB N="15" REF="17">
Army mu&s;t have &s;uffered greatly; and that, of this immen&s;e Number, but a very &s;mall Part cou'd have returned to enjoy the Plunder accumulated by the Lo&s;s of &s;o many of their Companions, and the Deva&s;tation of &s;o con&s;iderable a Part of the World. If this was the State of the Vic|torious, and from the Circum&s;tances, it mu&s;t have been this at the lea&s;t; the Con|quered, tho&s;e Nations who lo&s;t their Liberty, and tho&s;e who fought for it to|gether, mu&s;t have had a much heavier Lo&s;s. They mu&s;t have lo&s;t at lea&s;t double that Number, as the greate&s;t Slaughter is always in the Flight, and great Carnage did in tho&s;e Times and Countries ever at|tend the fir&s;t Rage of Conque&s;t. This Conqueror, the olde&s;t we have on the Re|cords of Hi&s;tory, (though, as we have ob&s;erved before, the Chronology of the&s;e remote Times is extremely uncertain), opens the Scene by a De&s;truction of at lea&s;t 1,800,000 of his Species, unprovoked but by his Ambition, without any Mo|tives
<PB N="16" REF="18">
but Pride, Cruelty and Madne&s;s, and without any Benefit to him&s;elf; (for <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI> expre&s;sly tells us, he did not maintain his Conque&s;ts) but &s;olely to make &s;o many People, in &s;o di&s;tant Countries, feel expe|rimentally, how &s;evere a Scourge Provi|dence intends for the human Race, when he gives one Man the Power over many, and arms his naturally impotent, and feeble Rage, with the Hands of Millions, who know no common Principle of Action, but a blind Obedience to the Pa&s;|&s;ions of their Ruler.</P>
<P>The next Per&s;onage who figures in the Tragedies of this ancient Theatre is <HI>Semi|ramis:</HI> For we have no Particulars of <HI>Ninus,</HI> but that he made immen&s;e and rapid Conque&s;ts, which doubtle&s;s were not compa&s;&s;ed without the u&s;ual Carnage. We hear of her Army of above three Millions employed in a War again&s;t the <HI>Indians.</HI> We hear of their having a yet greater; and of a War continued with
<PB N="17" REF="19">
much fury, and with various Succe&s;s. This ends in an Account of her Retreat, with &s;carce a third of the Troops employed in the Expedition; an Expedition, which at this rate mu&s;t have co&s;t two Millions of Souls on her part; and it is not unrea|&s;onable to judge that the Country which was the Seat of War, mu&s;t have been an equal Sufferer. Its Lo&s;s mu&s;t in this way of Computation be two Millions more. So that in this War alone, (for &s;he had other Wars) in this &s;ingle Reign, and in this one Spot of the Globe, did four Mil|lions of Souls expire, with all the horrid and &s;hocking Circum&s;tances which attend all Wars, and in a Quarrel, in which none of the Sufferers cou'd have the lea&s;t ra|tional Concern.</P>
<P>The <HI>Babylonian, A&s;&s;yrian, Median,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Monarchies mu&s;t have poured out Seas of Blood in their Formation, and in their De&s;truction. The Armies and Fleets of <HI>Xerxes,</HI> their Numbers, the glorious
<PB N="18" REF="20">
Stand made again&s;t them, and the unfor|tuate Event of all his mighty Preparations, are known to every body. In this Expe|dition, gleaning half <HI>A&s;ia</HI> of it's Inhabi|tants, he led an Army of about two Mil|lions to be &s;laughtered, and wa&s;ted, by a thou&s;and fatal Accidents, in the &s;ame Place where his Predece&s;&s;ors had before by a &s;imilar Madne&s;s con&s;umed the Flower of &s;o many Kingdoms, and wa&s;ted the Force of &s;o exten&s;ive an Empire. It is a cheap Calculation to &s;ay, that the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Em|pire in it's Wars, again&s;t the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Sythians,</HI> threw away at lea&s;t four Mil|lions of their Subjects, to &s;ay nothing of their other Wars, and the Lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained in them. The&s;e were their Lo&s;&s;es abroad; but the War was brought home to them, fir&s;t by <HI>Age&s;ilaus,</HI> and afterwards, by <HI>Alexander.</HI> I have not, in this Re|treat, the Books nece&s;&s;ary to make very exact Calculations; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to give more than Hints to one of your Lord&s;hip's Erudition. You will recollect
<PB N="19" REF="21">
his uninterrupted Series of Succe&s;s. You will run over his Battles. You will call to mind the Carnage which was made. You will give a Glance of the Whole, and you will agree with me; that to form this Hero no le&s;s than twelve hundred thou&s;and Lives mu&s;t have been &s;acrificed; but no &s;ooner had he fallen him&s;elf a Sacrifice to his Vices, than a thou&s;and Breaches were made for Ruin to enter, and give the la&s;t hand to this Scene of Mi&s;ery and De&s;truction. His Kingdom was rent and divided; which &s;erved to employ the more di&s;tinct Parts to tear each other to Pieces, and bury the whole in Blood and Slaughter. The Kings of <HI>Syria</HI> and of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Pergamus</HI> and <HI>Macedon,</HI> without Intermi&s;&s;ion worried each other for above two hundred Years; until at la&s;t a &s;trong Power ari&s;ing in the We&s;t, ru&s;hed in upon them and &s;ilenced their Tumuls, by in|volving all the contending Parties in the &s;ame De&s;truction. It is little to &s;ay, that the Contentions between the Succe&s;&s;ors of
<PB N="20" REF="22">
<HI>Alexander</HI> depopulated that Part of the World of at lea&s;t three Millions.</P>
<P>The Struggle between the <HI>Macedonians</HI> and <HI>Greeks,</HI> and before that, the Di&s;putes of the <HI>Greek</HI> Commonwealths among them&s;elves, for an unprofitable Supe|riority, form one of the bloodie&s;t Scenes in Hi&s;tory. One is a&s;toni&s;hed how &s;uch a &s;mall Spot could furni&s;h Men &s;ufficient to &s;acrifice to the pitiful Ambition of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing five or &s;ix thou&s;and more Acres, or two or three more Villages: Yet to &s;ee the Acrimony and Bitterne&s;s with which this was di&s;puted between the <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Lacedemonians;</HI> what Armies cut off; what Fleets &s;unk, and burnt; what a Number of Cities &s;acked, and their Inha|bitants &s;laughtered, and captived; one would be induced to believe the Deci&s;ion of the Fate of Mankind at lea&s;t, depended upon it! But the&s;e Di&s;putes ended as all &s;uch ever have done, and ever will do; in a real Weakne&s;s of all Parties; a mo|mentary
<PB N="21" REF="23">
Shadow, and Dream of Power in &s;ome one; and the Subjection of all to the Yoke of a Stranger, who knows how to profit of their Divi&s;ions. This at lea&s;t was the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> and &s;ure, from the earlie&s;t Accounts of them, to their Ab&s;orption into the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, we cannot judge that their inte&s;tine Divi&s;ions, to &s;ay nothing of their foreign Wars, con|&s;umed le&s;s than three Millions of their In|habitants.</P>
<P>What an <HI>Aceldama,</HI> what a Field of Blood <HI>Sicily</HI> has been in antient times, whil&s;t the Mode of it's Government was controverted between the Republican and Tyrannical Parties, and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;truggled for by the Natives, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> and the <HI>Romans,</HI> your Lord|&s;hip will ea&s;ily recollect. You will re|member the total De&s;truction of &s;uch Bodies as an Army of 300,000 Men. You will find every Page of it's Hi&s;tory dyed in Blood, and blotted and confounded
<PB N="22" REF="24">
by Tumults, Rebellions, Ma&s;&s;acres, A&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inations, Pro&s;criptions, and a Series of Horror beyond the Hi&s;tories perhaps of any other Nation in the World; though the Hi&s;tories of all Nations are made up of &s;imilar Matter. I once more excu&s;e my|&s;elf in point of Exactne&s;s for want of Books. But I &s;hall e&s;timate the Slaughters in this I&s;land but at two Millions; which your Lord&s;hip will find much &s;hort of the Reality.</P>
<P>Let us pa&s;s by the Wars, and the Con|&s;equences of them, which wa&s;ted <HI>Grecia-Magna,</HI> before the <HI>Roman</HI> Power prevailed in that Part of <HI>Italy.</HI> They are perhaps exaggerated; therefore I &s;hall only rate them at one Million. Let us ha&s;ten to open that great Scene which e&s;tabli&s;hes the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, and forms the grand Cata&s;trophe of the antient Drama. This Empire, whil&s;t in it's Infancy, began by an Effu&s;ion of human Blood &s;carcely cre|dible. The neighbouring little States
<PB N="23" REF="25">
teemed for new De&s;truction: The <HI>Sabines,</HI> the <HI>Samnites,</HI> the <HI>Aequi,</HI> the <HI>Vol&s;ci,</HI> the <HI>Hetrurians,</HI> were broken by a Series of Slaughters which had no Interruption, for &s;ome hundreds of Years; Slaughters which upon all &s;ides con&s;umed more than two Millions of the wretched People. The <HI>Gauls</HI> ru&s;hing into <HI>Italy</HI> about this Time, added the total De&s;truction of their own Armies to tho&s;e of the antient Inhabitants. In &s;hort, it were hardly po&s;&s;ible to con|ceive a more horrid and bloody Picture, if that which the <HI>Punic</HI> Wars that en&s;ued &s;oon after did not pre&s;ent one, that far ex|ceeds it. Here we find that Climax of Deva&s;tation, and Ruin, which &s;eemed to &s;hake the whole Earth. The Extent of this War which embraced &s;o many Na|tions, and both Elements, and the Havock of the human Species cau&s;ed in both, really a&s;toni&s;hes beyond Expre&s;&s;ion, when it is nakedly con&s;idered, and tho&s;e Matters which are apt to divert our Attention from it, the Characters, Actions, and De|&s;igns
<PB N="24" REF="26">
of the Per&s;ons concerned, are not taken into the Account. The&s;e Wars, I mean tho&s;e called the <HI>Punic</HI> Wars, cou'd not have &s;tood the human Race in le&s;s than five Millions of the Species. And yet this forms but a Part only, and a very &s;mall Part, of the Havock cau&s;ed by the <HI>Roman</HI> Ambition. The <HI>Mithridatick</HI> War was very little le&s;s bloody; that Prince cut off at one Stroke 150,000 <HI>Romans</HI> by a Ma&s;&s;acre. In that War <HI>Sylla</HI> de&s;troyed 300,000 Men at <HI>Cheronea.</HI> The &s;ame Commander defeated <HI>Mithridates'</HI> Army under <HI>Dorilaus,</HI> and &s;lew 300,000. The &s;ame Prince lo&s;t another 300,000 before <HI>Cyzicum.</HI> In the cour&s;e of the War he had innumerable other Lo&s;&s;es; and having many Intervals of Succe&s;s, he revenged them &s;everely. He was at la&s;t totally overthrown; and he cru&s;hed to Pieces the King of <HI>Armenia</HI> his Ally by the great|ne&s;s of his Ruin. All who had Con|nexions with him &s;hared the &s;ame Fate. The mercile&s;s Genius of <HI>Sylla</HI> had it's

full Scope; and the Streets of <HI>Athens</HI> were not the only ones which ran with Blood. At this Period, the Sword, glutted with foreign Slaughter, turned it's Edge upon the Bowels of the <HI>Roman</HI> Republick it&s;elf; and pre&s;ented a Scene of Cruelties and Trea&s;ons enough almo&s;t to obliterate the Memory of all the external Deva&s;tations. I intended, my LORD, to have proceeded in a &s;ort of Method in e&s;timating the Numbers of Mankind cut off in the&s;e Wars which we have on Record. But I am obliged to alter my De&s;ign. Such a tragical Uniformity of Havock and Mur|der would di&s;gu&s;t your Lord&s;hip as much as it would me; and I confe&s;s I already feel my eyes ake by keeping them &s;o long intent on &s;o bloody a Pro&s;pect.

<P>This Spot happened, it matters not here by what means, to become at &s;everal times extremely populous, and to &s;upply Men for Slaughters &s;carcely credible, if other well-known and well-atte&s;ted ones had not given them a Colour. The fir&s;t &s;ettling of the <HI>Jews</HI> here, was attended by an almo&s;t entire Extirpation of all the former Inhabitants. Their own civil Wars, and tho&s;e with their petty Neighbours, con|&s;umed va&s;t Multitudes almo&s;t every Year for &s;everal Centuries; and the Irruptions of the Kings of <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> made

immen&s;e Ravages. Yet we have their Hi&s;tory but partially, in an indi&s;tinct con|fu&s;ed manner; &s;o that I &s;hall only throw the &s;trong Point of Light upon that Part which coincides with <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory, and of that Part only on the Point of Time when they received the great and final Stroke which made them no more a Nation; a Stroke which is allowed to have cut off little le&s;s than two Millions of that People. I &s;ay nothing of the Loppings made from that Stock whil&s;t it &s;tood; nor from the Suckers that grew out of the old Root ever &s;ince. But if in this incon&s;iderable Part of the Globe, &s;uch a Carnage has been made in two or three &s;hort Reigns, and that this Carnage, great as it is, makes but a minute Part of what the Hi&s;tories of that People inform us they &s;uffered; what &s;hall we judge of Countries more extended, and which have waged Wars by far more con&s;iderable?</P>
<P>In&s;tances of this Sort compo&s;e the

When the <HI>Goths,</HI> the <HI>Vandals,</HI> and the <HI>Huns</HI> poured into <HI>Gaul, Italy, Spain, Greece,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> carrying De&s;truction before them as they advanced, and leaving horrid De&s;arts every where behind them. <HI>Va&s;tum ubique &s;i|lentium, &s;ecreti colles; fumantia procul tecta; nemo exploratoribus obvius,</HI> is what <HI>Tacitus</HI> calls <HI>facies Victoriae.</HI> It is always &s;o; but was here emphatically &s;o. From the North proceeded the Swarms of <HI>Goths, Vandals, Huns, O&s;trogoths,</HI> who ran towards the South into <HI>Africa</HI> it&s;elf, which &s;uffered as all to the North had done. About this Time, another Torrent of Barbarians, animated by the &s;ame Fury, and encouraged by the &s;ame Succe&s;s, poured out of the South, and ravaged all to the North-Ea&s;t, and We&s;t, to the re|mote&s;t Parts of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> on one hand, and to the Banks of the <HI>Loire</HI> or further on

the other; de&s;troying all the proud and curious Monuments of human Art, that not even the Memory might &s;eem to &s;urvive of the former Inhabitants. What has been done &s;ince, and what will con|tinue to be done whil&s;t the &s;ame Induce|ments to War continue, I &s;hall not dwell upon. I &s;hall only in one Word mention the horrid Effects of Bigotry and Avarice, in the Conque&s;t of <HI>Spani&s;h America;</HI> a Conque&s;t on a low E&s;timation effected by the Murder of ten Millions of the Species. I &s;hall draw to a Conclu&s;ion of this Part, by making a general Calculation of the Whole. I think I have actually mentioned above forty Millions. I have not particularized any more. I don't pretend to Exactne&s;s; therefore for the Sake of a general View, I &s;hall lay together all tho&s;e actually &s;lain in Battles, from the beginning of the World to this Day, in the four Parts of it, only at a thou&s;and times as much; a trifling Calculation, allowing
<PB N="30" REF="32">
for Time and Extent. We have not perhaps &s;poke of the Five Hundredth Part, I am &s;ure I have not of what is actually a&s;certain|ed in Hi&s;tory; but how much of the&s;e Butcheries are only expre&s;&s;ed in generals, what part of time Hi&s;tory has never reach|ed, and what va&s;t Spaces of the habitable Globe it has not embraced, I need not mention to your Lord&s;hip. I have no need to exaggerate; and I have purpo&s;ely avoided a Parade of Eloquence on this Occa&s;ion. I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e it upon any Occa&s;ion; el&s;e in mentioning the&s;e Slaugh|ters, it is obvious how much the whole might be heightened, by an affecting De&s;cription of the Horrors that attend the Wa&s;ting of Kingdoms, and Sacking of Cities. But I do not write to the Vulgar, nor to that which only governs the Vulgar, their Pa&s;&s;ions. I go upon a naked and mode|rate Calculation, ju&s;t enough, without a Pe|dantical Exactne&s;s, to give your Lord&s;hip &s;ome Feeling of the Effects of Political So|ciety.
<PB N="31" REF="33">
I charge the whole of the&s;e Effects on Political Society. I avow the Charge, and &s;hall pre&s;ently make it good to your Lord&s;hip's Satisfaction. The Numbers I par|ticularized are about 40 Millions. I &s;uppo&s;e a Thou&s;and times as many killed in Battles. But I mu&s;t make another Addition not le&s;s than the former, for the Con&s;equences of Wars, in Skirmi&s;hes, Ma&s;&s;acres, the contagious Di&s;orders, and the Famine which attend them, more de&s;tructive than Battles them&s;elves. So that allowing me in my Exuberance one way for my De|ficiencies in others, I rate the De&s;truction cau&s;ed by War, at Eighty Thou&s;and Mil|lions. I think the Numbers of Men now upon Earth are computed at 500 Millions at the mo&s;t. Here the Slaughter of Man|kind, on what you will call a &s;mall Calcu|lation, amounts to 160 times the Number of Souls this Day on the Globe. A point which may furni&s;h matter of Reflection to one le&s;s inclined to draw Con&s;equences than your Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34">
I now come to &s;hew, that Political Society is ju&s;tly chargeable with much the greate&s;t Part of this De&s;truction of the Species. But to give the faire&s;t Play to every &s;ide of the Que&s;tion, I will own that there is a Haughtine&s;s, and Fiercene&s;s in human Nature, which will cau&s;e innu|merable Broils, place Men in what State you plea&s;e; but owning this, I &s;till in&s;i&s;t in charging to Political Regulations, that the&s;e Broils are &s;o frequent, &s;o cruel, and attended with &s;o deplorable Con&s;e|quences. In a State of Nature, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to join together a Number of Men, &s;ufficiently agreed in the &s;ame bloody De&s;ign, nece&s;&s;ary to make a very exten&s;ive Havock of their Species; and if they would come to &s;uch an Agreement, (an impo&s;&s;ible Suppo&s;ition) yet the Means that &s;imple Nature has &s;upplied them with, are by no Means adequate to &s;uch a Pur|po&s;e; many Scratches, many Brui&s;es un|doubtedly would be received upon all hands; but only a few, a very few

Deaths, Society, and Politicks, which have given us the&s;e de&s;tructive Views, have given us too the Means of &s;atisfying them. From the earlie&s;t Dawnings of Po|licy to this Day, the Invention of Men has been &s;harpening and improving the My&s;tery of Murder, from the fir&s;t rude E&s;&s;ays of Clubs and Stones, to the pre&s;ent Perfection of Gunnery, Cannoneering, Bombarding, Ruining, and all the&s;e Spe|cies of artificial, learned, and refined Cruelty, at which we are now &s;o expert, and which make a principal Part of what Politicians have taught us to believe is our principal Glory,</P>
<P>How far mere Nature would have car|ried us, we may judge by the Example of tho&s;e Animals, who &s;till follow her Laws, and even tho&s;e to whom &s;he has given Di&s;|po&s;itions more fierce, and Arms more terrible than ever &s;he intended we &s;hould u&s;e. It is an inconte&s;tible Truth, that there is more Havock made in one Year
<PB N="34" REF="36">
by Men, of Men, than has been made by all the Lions, Tygers, Panthers, Ounces, Leopards, Hyenas, Rhinocero&s;es, Elephants, Bears, and Wolves, upon their &s;everal Species, &s;ince the Beginning of the World; though the&s;e agree ill enough with each other, and have a much greater Proportion of Rage and Fury in their Compo&s;ition than we have. But with re|&s;pect to you, ye Legi&s;lators, ye Civilizers of Mankind! ye Orpheus's, Mo&s;e&s;es, Mi|no&s;es, Solons, The&s;eu&s;es, Lycurgu&s;es, Numas! with Re&s;pect to you be it &s;poken, your Regulations have done more Mi&s;chief in cold Blood, than all the Rage of the fierce&s;t Animals in their greate&s;t Terrors, or Furies, has ever done, or ever could do!</P>
<P>The&s;e Evils are not accidental. Who|ever will take the pains to con&s;ider the Na|ture of Society, will find they re&s;ult di|rectly from it's Con&s;titution. For as <HI>Sub|ordination,</HI> or in other Words, the Reci|procation

of Tyranny, and Slavery, is re|qui&s;ite to &s;upport the&s;e Societies, the In|tere&s;t, the Ambition, the Malice, or the Re|venge, nay even the Whim and Caprice of one ruling Man among them, is enough to arm all the re&s;t, without any private Views of their own, to the wor&s;t and blacke&s;t Purpo&s;es; and what is at once la|mentable, and ridiculous, the&s;e Wretches engage under tho&s;e Banners with a Fury greater than if they were animated by Re|venge for their own proper Wrongs.</P>
<P>It is no le&s;s worth ob&s;erving, that this artificial Divi&s;ion of Mankind, into &s;e|parate Societies, is a perpetual Source in it&s;elf of Hatred and Di&s;&s;ention among them. The Names which di&s;tingui&s;h them are enough to blow up Hatred, and Rage. Examine Hi&s;tory; con&s;ult pre&s;ent Experience; and you will find, that far the greater Part of the Quarrels between &s;everal Nations, had &s;carce any other Occa&s;ion, than that they were ano|ther

<P><PB N="37" REF="39">
This natural unpremeditated Effect of Policy on the unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Pa&s;&s;ions of Man|kind, appears on other Occa&s;ions. The very Name of a Politician, a State&s;man, is &s;ure to cau&s;e Terror and Hatred; it has always connected with it the Ideas of Treachery, Cruelty, Fraud and Tyranny; and tho&s;e Writers who have faithfully un|veiled the My&s;teries of State-freema&s;onry, have ever been held in general Dete&s;tation, for even knowing &s;o perfectly a Theory &s;o dete&s;table.

His Speculation is more abhorred than their Practice.</P>
<P>But if there were no other Arguments again&s;t Artificial Society than this I am go|ing to mention, methinks it ought to fall by that one only. All Writers on the Sci|ence of Policy are agreed, and they agree
<PB N="38" REF="40">
with Experience, that all Governments mu&s;t frequently infringe the Rules of Ju&s;|tice to &s;upport them&s;elves; that Truth mu&s;t give way to Di&s;&s;imulation; Hone&s;ty to Convenience; and Humanity it&s;elf to the reigning Intere&s;t. The Whole of this My&s;tery of Iniquity is called the Rea&s;on of State. It is a Rea&s;on, which I own I can|not penetrate. What Sort of a Protection is this of the general Right, that is main|tained by infringing the Rights of Parti|culars? What Sort of Ju&s;tice is this, which is inforced by Breaches of it's own Laws? The&s;e Paradoxes I leave to be &s;olved by the able Heads of Legi&s;lators and Politi|cians. For my Part, I &s;hould &s;ay what a plain Man would &s;ay on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion. I can never believe, that any In&s;titution agreeable to Nature, and proper for Man|kind, could find it nece&s;&s;ary, or even expe|dient in any Ca&s;e what&s;oever to do, what the be&s;t and worthie&s;t In&s;tincts of Man|kind warn us to avoid. But no wonder,
<PB N="39" REF="41">
that what is &s;et up in Oppo&s;ition to the State of Nature, &s;hould pre&s;erve it&s;elf by trampling upon the Law of Nature.</P>
<P>To prove, that the&s;e Sort of policed Societies are a Violation offered to Nature, and a Con&s;traint upon the human Mind, it needs only to look upon the &s;anguinary Mea&s;ures, and In&s;truments of Violence which are every where u&s;ed to &s;upport them. Let us take a Review of the Dun|geons, Whips, Chains, Racks, Gibbets, with which every Society is abundantly &s;tored, by which hundreds of Victims are annually offered up to &s;upport a dozen or two in Pride and Madne&s;s, and Millions in an abject Servitude, and Dependence. There was a Time, when I looked with a reverential Awe on the&s;e My&s;teries of Po|licy; but Age, Experience, and Philo&s;o|phy have rent the Veil; and I view this <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> at lea&s;t, without any enthu&s;ia&s;tick Admiration. I acknowledge indeed, the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a Proceeding
<PB N="40" REF="42">
in &s;uch In&s;titutions; but I can have but a very humble Opinion of In&s;titutions where &s;uch Proceedings are nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It is a Misfortune, that in no Part of the Globe natural Liberty and natural Reli|gion are to be found pure and free from the Mixture of Political Adulterations. Yet we have implanted in us by Providence Ideas, Axioms, Rules, of what is pious, ju&s;t, fair, hone&s;t, which no Political Craft, nor learned Sophi&s;try, can entirely expel from our Brea&s;ts. By the&s;e we judge, and we cannot otherwi&s;e judge of the &s;everal artificial Modes of Religion and Society, and determine of them as they approach to, or recede from this Standard.</P>
<P>The &s;imple&s;t Form of Government is <HI>De&s;poti&s;m,</HI> where all the inferior Orbs of Power are moved merely by the Will of the Supreme, and all that are &s;ubjected to them, directed in the &s;ame Manner, merely by the occa&s;ional Will of the Magi&s;trate.
<PB N="41" REF="43">
This Form, as it is the mo&s;t &s;imple, &s;o it is infinitely the mo&s;t general. Scarce any Part of the World is exempted from it's Power. And in tho&s;e few Places where Men enjoy what they call Liberty, it is continually in a tottering Situation, and makes greater and greater Strides to that Gulph of De&s;poti&s;m which at la&s;t &s;wallows up every Species of Government. This Manner of ruling being directed merely by the Will of the weake&s;t, and generally the wor&s;t Man in the Society, becomes the mo&s;t fooli&s;h and capricious Thing, at the &s;ame time that it is the mo&s;t terrible and de&s;tructive that well can be conceived. In a De&s;poti&s;m the principal Per&s;on finds, that let the Want, Mi&s;ery, and Indigence of his Subjects, be what they will, he can yet po&s;&s;e&s;s abundantly of every thing to gratify his mo&s;t in&s;atiable Wi&s;hes. He does more. He finds that the&s;e Gratifi|cations increa&s;e in Proportion to the Wretchedne&s;s and Slavery of his Subjects. So that neglecting the publick Welfare,
<PB N="42" REF="44">
and by his Station placed above both Shame and Fear, he proceeds to the mo&s;t horrid and &s;hocking Outrages upon Mankind. Their Per&s;ons become Victims of his Su&s;|picions. The &s;lighte&s;t Anger is Death; and a di&s;agreeable A&s;pect is often as great a Crime as High Trea&s;on. In the Court of <HI>Nero</HI> a Per&s;on of Learning, of unque&s;|tioned Merit, and of un&s;u&s;pected Loyalty, was put to Death for no other Rea&s;on than that he had a pedantick Countenance which di&s;plea&s;ed the Emperor. This very Mon|&s;ter of Mankind appeared in the Beginning of his Reign to be a Per&s;on of Virtue. Many of the greate&s;t Tyrants on the Re|cords of Hi&s;tory have begun to rule in the faire&s;t Manner. But the Truth is, this unnatural Power corrupts both the Heart, and the Under&s;tanding. And to prevent the lea&s;t Hope of Amendment, a King is ever &s;urrounded by a Crowd of infamous Flatterers, who find their Account in keep|ing him from the lea&s;t Light of Rea&s;on, till all Ideas of Rectitude and Ju&s;tice are ut|terly
<PB N="43" REF="45">
era&s;ed from his Mind. When <HI>Alex|ander</HI> had in his Fury inhumanly butch|ered one of his be&s;t Friends, and brave&s;t Captains; on the Return of Rea&s;on he begun to conceive an Horror &s;uitable to the Guilt of &s;uch a Murder. In this Junc|ture, his Council came to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. But what did his Council? They found him out a Philo&s;opher who gave him Comfort. And in what Manner did this Philo&s;opher comfort him for the Lo&s;s of &s;uch a Man, and heal his Con&s;cience, fla|grant with the Smart of &s;uch a Crime? You have the Matter at Length in <HI>Plutarch.</HI> He told him; <Q REND="inline">"<HI>that let a Sovereign do what he will, all his Actions are ju&s;t and lawful, becau&s;e they are his.</HI>"</Q> The Palaces of all Princes abound with &s;uch courtly Philo&s;o|phers. The Con&s;equence was &s;uch as might be expected. He grew every Day a Mon&s;ter more abandoned to unnatural Lu&s;t, to Debauchery, to Drunkenne&s;s, and to Murder. And yet this was originally a great Man, of uncommon Capacity, and
<PB N="44" REF="46">
a &s;trong Propen&s;ity to Virtue. But un|bounded Power proceeds Step by Step, until it has eradicated every laudable Principle. It has been remarked, that there is no Prince &s;o bad, who&s;e Favourites and Mi|ni&s;ters are not wor&s;e. There is hardly any Prince without a Favourite, by whom he is governed in as arbitrary a Manner as he governs the Wretches &s;ubjected to him. Here the Tyranny is doubled. There are two Courts, and two Intere&s;ts; both very different from the Intere&s;ts of the People. The Favourite knows that the Regard of a Tyrant is as uncon&s;tant and capricious as that of a Woman; and concluding his Time to be &s;hort, he makes Ha&s;te to fill up the Mea&s;ure of his Iniquity, in Rapine, in Luxury, and in Revenge. Every Avenue to the Throne is &s;hut up. He oppre&s;&s;es, and ruins the People, whil&s;t he per&s;uades the Prince, that tho&s;e Murmurs rai&s;ed by his own Oppre&s;&s;ion are the Ef|fects of Di&s;affection to the Prince's Go|vernment. Then is the natural Violence
<PB N="45" REF="47">
of De&s;poti&s;m inflamed, and aggravated by Hatred, and Revenge. To de&s;erve well of the State is a Crime again&s;t the Prince. To be popular, and to be a Traitor, are con&s;idered as &s;ynonimous Terms. Nay, even Virtue is dangerous, as an a&s;piring Quality, that claims an E&s;teem by it&s;elf, and independent of the Countenance of the Court. What has been &s;aid of the chief, is true of the inferior Officers of this Species of Government; each in his Pro|vince exerci&s;ing the &s;ame Tyranny, and grinding the People by an Oppre&s;&s;ion, the more &s;everely felt, as it is near them, and exerci&s;ed by ba&s;e and &s;ubordinate Per&s;ons. For the Gro&s;s of the People; they are con&s;idered as a mere Herd of Cattle; and really in a little Time become no better; all Principle of hone&s;t Pride, all Sen&s;e of the Dignity of their Nature, is lo&s;t in their Slavery. The Day, &s;ays <HI>Homer,</HI> which makes a Man a Slave, takes away half his Worth; and in Fact, he lo&s;es every Im|pul&s;e to Action, but that low and ba&s;e

one of Fear.&mdash;In this Kind of Govern|ment human Nature is not only abu&s;ed, and in&s;ulted, but it is actually degraded and &s;unk into a Species of Brutality. The Con&s;ideration of this made Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> &s;ay, with great Ju&s;tice, that a Government of this Kind was wor&s;e than Anarchy; in|deed it is &s;o abhorred, and dete&s;ted by all who live under Forms that have a milder Appearance, that there is &s;carce a rational Man in <HI>Europe,</HI> that would not prefer Death to <HI>A&s;iatick</HI> De&s;poti&s;m.

<P>In all Parts of the World, Mankind, however deba&s;ed, retains &s;till the Sen&s;e of <HI>Feeling;</HI> the Weight of Tyranny, at la&s;t, becomes in&s;upportable; but the Remedy is not &s;o ea&s;y; in general, the only Re|medy by which they attempt to cure the Tyranny, is to change the Tyrant; this is, and always was the Ca&s;e for the greater Part.

But it is now found by abundant Experience, that an <HI>Ari&s;tocracy,</HI> and a <HI>De&s;poti&s;m,</HI> differ but in Name; and that a People, who are in general excluded from any Share of the Legi&s;lative, are to all Intents and Purpo&s;es, as much Slaves, when twenty, independ|ent of them, govern, as when but one domineers. The Tyranny is even more felt, as every Individual of the Nobles has the Haughtine&s;s of a Sultan; the People are more mi&s;erable, as they &s;eem on the Verge of Liberty, from which they are for ever debarred; this Pro&s;pect, whil&s;t it pre&s;ents a vain Shadow of Happine&s;s to the Subject, binds fa&s;ter the Chains of their Subjection; what is left undone, by the natural Ava|rice

In Effect, the Yoke of this Species of Government is &s;o galling, that when|ever the People have got the lea&s;t Power, they have &s;haken it off with the utmo&s;t Indignation, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a Popular Form; and when they have not had Strength enough to &s;upport them&s;elves, they have thrown them&s;elves into the Arms of <HI>De&s;poti&s;m,</HI> as the more eligible of the two Evils.

The People are not only Politically, but Per&s;onally Slaves, and treated with the utmo&s;t Indignity.

They con&s;ider their Subjects, as the Farmer does the Hog he keeps to fea&s;t upon.

So &s;candalou&s;ly debauched a People as that of <HI>Venice,</HI> is to be met with no where el&s;e. High, Low, Men, Women, Clergy, and Laity, are all alike. The Ruling Nobility are no le&s;s afraid of one another, than they are of the People; and for that Rea&s;on, politi|cally enervate their own Body by the &s;ame

effeminate Luxury, by which they cor|rupt their Subjects. They are impoveri&s;h|ed by every means which can be invented; and they are kept in a perpetual Terror by the Horrors of a State Inqui&s;ition; here you &s;ee a People deprived of all rational Freedom, and tyrannized over by about two Thou&s;and Men; and yet this Body of two Thou&s;and, are &s;o far from enjoy|ing any Liberty by the Subjection of the re&s;t, that they are in an infinitely &s;everer State of Slavery; they make them&s;elves the mo&s;t degenerate, and unhappy of Mankind, for no other Purpo&s;e than that they may the more effectually contribute to the Mi&s;ery of an whole Nation.

<P>Thus, my Lord, we have pur&s;ued <HI>Ari&s;tocracy</HI> through it's whole Progre&s;s; we have &s;een the Seeds, the Growth, and

the Fruit. It could boa&s;t none of the Ad|vantages of a <HI>De&s;poti&s;m,</HI> mi&s;erable as tho&s;e Advantages were, and it was overloaded with an Exuberance of Mi&s;chiefs, unknown even to <HI>De&s;poti&s;m</HI> it&s;elf. In Effect, it is no more than a di&s;orderly Tyranny. This Form therefore could be little approved, even in Speculation, by tho&s;e who were capable of thinking, and could be le&s;s born in Practice by any who were capa|ble of feeling. However, the fruitful Policy of Man was not yet exhau&s;ted. He had yet another Farthing Candle to &s;upply the Deficiencies of the Sun. This was the third Form, known by Political Writers under the Name of <HI>Democracy.</HI> Here the People tran&s;acted all Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, or the greater Part of it, in their own Per&s;ons: their Laws were made by them&s;elves, and upon any Failure of Duty, their Officers were accountable to them&s;elves, and to them only. In all appearance, they had &s;ecured by this Method the Advantages of Order and good Government, without
<PB N="54" REF="56">
paying their Liberty for the Purcha&s;e. Now, my Lord, we are come to the Ma&s;ter-piece of <HI>Grecian</HI> Refinement, and <HI>Roman</HI> Solidity, a Popular Government. The earlie&s;t and mo&s;t celebrated Republick of this Model, was that of <HI>Athens.</HI> It was con&s;tructed by no le&s;s an Arti&s;t, than the celebrated Poet and Philo&s;opher, <HI>Solon.</HI> But no &s;ooner was this Political Ve&s;&s;el launched from the Stocks, than it over|&s;et, even in the Life-time of the Builder. A Tyranny immediately &s;upervened; not by a foreign Conque&s;t, not by Accident, but by the very Nature and Con&s;titution of a <HI>Democracy.</HI> An artful Man became popular, the People had Power in their hands, and they devolved a con&s;iderable Share of their Power upon their Favourite; and the only u&s;e he made of this Power, was, to plunge tho&s;e who gave it into Slavery. Accident re&s;tored their Liberty, and the &s;ame good Fortune produced Men of uncommon Abilities and uncommon Virtues among&s;t them. But the&s;e Abilities
<PB N="55" REF="57">
were &s;uffered to be of little Service either to their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors or to the State. Some they bani&s;hed, others they impri&s;oned, and all they treated with various Circum|&s;tances of the mo&s;t &s;hameful Ingratitude. Republicks have many things in the Spirit of ab&s;olute Monarchy, but none more than this; a &s;hining Merit is ever hated or &s;u&s;pected in a Popular A&s;&s;embly, as well as in a Court; and all Services done the State, are looked upon as dangerous to the Rulers, whether Sultans or Senators. The <HI>O&s;traci&s;m</HI> at <HI>Athens</HI> was built upon this Principle. The giddy People whom we have now under Con&s;ideration, being elated with &s;ome Fla&s;hes of Succe&s;s, which they owed to nothing le&s;s than any Merit of their own, began to tyrannize over their Equals, who had a&s;&s;ociated with them for their common Defence. With their Prudence they renounced all Appear|ance of Ju&s;tice. They entered into Wars ra&s;hly and wantonly. If they were un|&s;ucce&s;sful, in&s;tead of growing wi&s;er by their
<PB N="56" REF="58">
Misfortune, they threw the whole Blame of their own Mi&s;conduct on the Mini&s;ters who had advi&s;ed, and the Generals who had conducted tho&s;e Wars; until by De|grees they had cut off all who could &s;erve them in their Councils or their Battles. If at any time the&s;e Wars had an happier I&s;&s;ue, it was no le&s;s difficult to deal with them on account of their Pride and In&s;o|lence. Furious in their Adver&s;ity, ty|rannical in their Succe&s;&s;es, a Commander had more trouble to concert his Defence before the People, than to plan the Ope|rations of the Campaign. It was frequent enough for a General, under the horrid <HI>De&s;poti&s;m</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, to be ill received in Proportion to the Greatne&s;s of his Services. <HI>Agricola</HI> is a &s;trong In|&s;tance of this. No Man had done greater things, nor with an hone&s;ter Ambition. Yet on his Return to Court, he was obliged to enter <HI>Rome</HI> with all the Secrecy of a Criminal. He went to the Palace, not like a victorious Commander who had
<PB N="57" REF="59">
merited and might demand the greate&s;t Rewards, but like an Offender who had come to &s;upplicate a Pardon for his Crimes. His Reception was an&s;werable: <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Brevi o&s;culo, &amp; nullo &s;ermone exceptus, turba &s;ervientium immi&s;tus e&s;t.</HI>"</Q> Yet in that wor&s;t Sea&s;on of this wor&s;t of monarchical <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sciant quibus moris illicita mirari, po&s;&s;e etiam &s;ub malis principibus magnos viros, &amp;c. <HI>See</HI> 42 to the End of it.</NOTE>Tyrannies, Mode&s;ty, Di&s;cretion, and a Coolne&s;s of Temper, formed &s;ome Kind of Security even for the highe&s;t Merit. But at <HI>Athens,</HI> the nice&s;t and be&s;t &s;tudied Behaviour was not a &s;ufficient Guard for a Man of great Capacity. Some of their brave&s;t Commanders were obliged to fly their Country, &s;ome to enter into the Ser|vice of it's Enemies, rather than abide a popular Determination on their Conduct, le&s;t, as one of them &s;aid, their Giddine&s;s might make the People condemn where they meant to acquit; to throw in a black Bean, even when they intended a white one.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="60">
The <HI>Athenians</HI> made a very rapid Pro|gre&s;s to the mo&s;t enormous Exce&s;&s;es. The People under no Re&s;traint &s;oon grew di&s;|&s;olute, luxurious, and idle. They re|nounced all Labour, and began to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them&s;elves from the publick Revenues. They lo&s;t all Concern for their common Honour or Safety, and could bear no Ad|vice that tended to reform them. At this Time Truth became offen&s;ive to tho&s;e Lords the People, and mo&s;t highly dan|gerous to the Speaker. The Orators no longer a&s;cended the <HI>Ro&s;trum,</HI> but to cor|rupt them further with the mo&s;t ful&s;ome Adulation. The&s;e Orators were all bribed by foreign Princes on the one Side or the other. And be&s;ides it's own Parties, in this City there were Parties, and avowed ones too, for the <HI>Per&s;ians, Spartans</HI> and <HI>Macedonians,</HI> &s;upported each of them by one or more Demagogues pen&s;ioned and bribed to this iniquitous Service. The People, forgetful of all Virtue and publick Spirit, and intoxicated with the Flatteries
<PB N="59" REF="61">
of their Orators (the&s;e Courtiers of Repub|licks, and endowed with the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Characters of all other Courtiers) this People, I &s;ay, at la&s;t arrived at that Pitch of Madne&s;s, that they coolly and delibe|rately, by an expre&s;s Law, made it capital for any Man to propo&s;e an Application of the immen&s;e Sums &s;quandered in publick Shows, even to the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Pur|po&s;es of the State. When you &s;ee the People of this Republick bani&s;hing or murdering their be&s;t and able&s;t Citizens, di&s;&s;ipating the publick Trea&s;ure with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s Extravagance, and &s;pending their whole Time, as Spectators or Actors, in playing, fidling, dancing and &s;inging, does it not, my LORD, &s;trike your Imagi|nation with the Image of a Sort of a com|plex <HI>Nero?</HI> And does it not &s;trike you with the greater Horror, when you ob&s;erve, not one Man only, but a whole City, grown drunk with Pride and Power, running with a Rage of Folly into the &s;ame mean and &s;en&s;ele&s;s Debauchery and Extrava|gance?

But if this People re&s;embled <HI>Nero</HI> in their Extravagance, much more did they re&s;emble and even exceed him in Cruelty and Inju&s;tice.

And had the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Prince intended the Ruin of this City of wicked Bedlamites, he could not have taken a more effectual Method to do it, than by &s;uch an en&s;naring Large&s;s. The Di&s;tribution of this Bounty cau&s;ed a Quarrel; the Majority &s;et on foot an En|quiry into the Title of the Citizens, and upon a vain Pretence of Illegitimacy, newly and occa&s;ionally &s;et up, they de|prived of their Share of the royal Dona|tion no le&s;s than five thou&s;and of their own Body. They went further; they di&s;|franchi&s;ed them; and having once begun with an Act of Inju&s;tice, they could &s;et no Bounds to it. Not content with cutting them off from the Rights of Citizens, they

plundered the&s;e unfortunate Wretches of all their Sub&s;tance; and to crown this Ma&s;ter|piece of Violence and Tyranny, they actu|ally &s;old every Man of the five thou&s;and as Slaves in the publick Market. Ob&s;erve, my LORD, that the five thou&s;and we here &s;peak of, were cut off from a Body of no more than nineteen thou&s;and; for the entire Number of Citizens was no greater at that Time. Could the Tyrant who wi&s;hed the <HI>Roman</HI> People but one Neck, could the Tyrant him&s;elf have done, nay, he could &s;carcely wi&s;h for a greater Mi&s;chief, than to have cut off, at one Stroke, a fourth of his People? Or has the Cruelty of that Series of &s;anguine Tyrants, the <HI>Cae&s;ars,</HI> ever pre&s;ented &s;uch a Piece of flagrant and exten&s;ive Wickedne&s;s? The whole Hi&s;|tory of this celebrated Republick is but one Ti&s;&s;ue of Ra&s;hne&s;s, Folly, Ingratitude, In|ju&s;tice, Tumult, Violence, and Tyranny, and indeed of every Species of Wicked|ne&s;s that can well be imagined. This was a City of Wi&s;emen, in which a Mini&s;ter

could not exerci&s;e his Functions; a war|like People, among&s;t whom a General did not dare either to gain or lo&s;e a Battle; a learned Nation, in which a Philo&s;opher could not enter on a free Enquiry.

they may differ in Name, or in &s;ome &s;light Circum&s;tances, to be all alike in Effect; in Effect, to be all Tyrannies. But &s;up|po&s;e we were inclined to make the mo&s;t ample Conce&s;&s;ions; let us concede <HI>Athens, Rome, Carthage,</HI> and two or three more of the antient, and many of the modern Commonwealths, to have been, or to be free and happy, and to owe their Freedom and Happine&s;s to their Political Con&s;titu|tion. Yet allowing all this, what De|fence does this make for Artificial Society in general, that the&s;e incon&s;iderable Spots of the Globe have for &s;ome &s;hort Space of Time &s;tood as Exceptions to a Charge &s;o general? But when we call the&s;e Govern|ments free, or concede that their Citizens were happier than tho&s;e which lived under different Forms, it is merely <HI>ex Abundan|tia.</HI> For we &s;hould be greatly mi&s;taken, if we really thought that the Majority of the People which filled the&s;e Cities, en|joyed even that nominal Political Freedom of which I have &s;poken &s;o much already.

In Reality, they had no Part of it. In <HI>Athens</HI> there were u&s;ually from ten to thirty thou|&s;and Freemen: This was the utmo&s;t. But the Slaves u&s;ually amounted to four hun|dred thou&s;and, and &s;ometimes to a great many more. The Freemen of <HI>Sparta</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> were not more numerous in Propor|tion to tho&s;e whom they held in a Slavery, even more terrible than the <HI>Athenians.</HI> Therefore &s;tate the Matter fairly: The free States never formed, though they were taken altogether, the thou&s;andth Part of the habitable Globe; the Freemen in the&s;e States were never the twentieth Part of the People, and the Time they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted is &s;carce any thing in that immen&s;e Ocean of Duration in which Time and Slavery are &s;o nearly commen&s;urate. Therefore call the&s;e free States, or popular Govern|ments, or what you plea&s;e; when we con|&s;ider the Majority of their Inhabitants, and regard the natural Rights of Mankind, they mu&s;t appear in Reality and Truth,

as Bigotry cramps tho&s;e of the general Herd of Mankind. But whoever is a genuine Follower of Truth, keeps his Eye &s;teady upon his Guide, indifferent whither he is led, provided that &s;he is the Leader. And, my LORD, if it be properly con&s;idered, it were infinitely better to remain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the whole Legion of vulgar Mi&s;takes, than to reject &s;ome, and at the &s;ame time to retain a Fondne&s;s for others altogether as ab&s;urd and irrational. The fir&s;t has at lea&s;t a Con&s;i&s;tency, that makes a Man, however erroneou&s;ly, uniform at lea&s;t; but the latter way of proceeding is &s;uch an incon&s;i&s;tent Chimaera and Jumble of Philo&s;ophy and vulgar Prejudice, that hardly any thing more ridiculous can be conceived. Let us therefore freely, and without Fear or Prejudice, examine this la&s;t Contrivance of Policy. And without con&s;idering how near the Quick our In|&s;truments may come, let us &s;earch it to the Bottom.</P>

Fir&s;t then, all Men are agreed, that this Junction of Regal, Ari&s;tocratick, and Popular Power, mu&s;t form a very complex, nice, and intricate Machine, which being compo&s;ed of &s;uch a variety of Parts, with &s;uch oppo&s;ite Tendencies and Movements, it mu&s;t be liable on every Accident to be di&s;ordered. To &s;peak without Metaphor, &s;uch a Government mu&s;t be liable to frequent Cabals, Tu|mults, and Revolutions, from it's very Con|&s;titution. The&s;e are undoubtedly as ill Effects, as can happen in a Society; for in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, the Clo&s;ene&s;s acquired by Community, in&s;tead of &s;erving for mutual Defence, &s;erves only to increa&s;e the Danger.

Hence it is, that whil&s;t the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Government &s;hould be carrying on, the Que&s;tion is, who has a Right to exerci&s;e this or that Function of it, or what Men have Power to keep their Offices in any Function. Whil&s;t this Conte&s;t continues, and whil&s;t the Ballance in any &s;ort continues, it has never any Remi&s;&s;ion; all manner of Abu&s;es and Villainies in Officers remain unpuni&s;hed, the greate&s;t Frauds and Robberies in the Publick Revenues are committed in De|fiance of Ju&s;tice; and Abu&s;es grow, by Time and Impunity, into Cu&s;toms; until they pre&s;cribe again&s;t the Laws, and grow too inveterate often to admit a Cure, unle&s;s &s;uch as may be as bad as the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

the Spirit which each Form has &s;eparately. Kings are ambitious; the Nobility haugh|ty; and the Populace tumultuous and ungovernable. Each Party, however in appearance peaceable, carries on a De&s;ign upon the others; and it is owing to this, that in all Que&s;tions, whether concerning foreign or dome&s;tick Affairs, the Whole generally turns more upon &s;ome Party Matter than upon the Nature of the Thing it&s;elf. Whether &s;uch a Step will dimini&s;h or augment the Power of the Crown, or how far the Privileges of the Subject are like to be extended or re&s;tricted by it. And the&s;e Que&s;tions are con&s;tantly re|&s;olved, without any Con&s;ideration of the Merits of the Cau&s;e, merely as the Parties who uphold the&s;e jarring Intere&s;ts may chance to prevail; and as they prevail, the Ballance is over&s;et, now upon one &s;ide, now upon the other. The Government is one Day, arbitrary Power in a &s;ingle Per&s;on; another, a juggling Confederacy of a few to cheat the Prince and en&s;lave

the People; and the third, a frantick and unmanageable Democracy. The great In|&s;trument of all the&s;e Changes, and what infu&s;es a peculiar Venom into all of them, is Party. It is of no Con&s;equence what the Principles of any Party, or what their Preten&s;ions are; the Spirit which actuates all Parties is the &s;ame; the Spirit of Am|bition, of Self-Intere&s;t, of Oppre&s;&s;ion, and Treachery. This Spirit entirely rever&s;es all the Principles which a benevolent Nature has erected within us; all Hone&s;ty, all equal Ju&s;tice, and even the Ties of Natural Society, the Natural Affections.

The&s;e and many more Points I am far from &s;preading to their full Extent. You are &s;en&s;ible that I do not put forth half my Strength; and you cannot be at a Lo&s;s for the Rea&s;on.

I could &s;hew how vehemently they have contended for Names, and how &s;ilently they have pa&s;&s;ed over Things of the la&s;t Importance. And I could demon|&s;trate, that they have had the Opportunity of doing all this Mi&s;chief, nay, that they them&s;elves had their Origin and Growth from that complex Form of Government

which we are wi&s;ely taught to look upon as &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing. Revolve, my LORD, our Hi&s;tory from the Conque&s;t. We &s;carce ever had a Prince, who by Fraud, or Violence, had not made &s;ome Infringe|ment on the Con&s;titution. We &s;carce ever had a Parliament which knew, when it attempted to &s;et Limits to the Royal Au|thority, how to &s;et Limits to it's own. Evils we have had continually calling for Reformation, and Reformations more grievous than any Evils. Our boa&s;ted Li|berty &s;ometimes trodden down, &s;ometimes giddily &s;et up, and ever precariou&s;ly fluc|tuating and un&s;ettled; it has been only kept alive by the Bla&s;ts of continual Feuds, Wars, and Con&s;piracies. In no Country in <HI>Europe</HI> has the Scaffold &s;o often blu&s;hed with the Blood of it's Nobility.

than they have at this Day. In the&s;e early and unrefined Ages, the jarring Parts of a certain Chaotic Con&s;titution &s;upported their &s;everal Preten&s;ions by the Sword. Experience and Policy have &s;ince taught other Methods. <Q><L><HI>Res vero nunc agitur tenui pulmone rubetae.</HI></L></Q>

I di&s;cover the Mi&s;takes in tho&s;e Plans, from the real known Con&s;e|quences which have re&s;ulted from them. They have inli&s;ted Rea&s;on to fight again&s;t it&s;elf, and employ it's whole Force to prove that it is an in&s;ufficient Guide to them in the Conduct of their Lives. But unhap|pily for us, in Proportion as we have de|viated from the plain Rule of our Nature, and turned our Rea&s;on again&s;t it&s;elf, in that Proportion have we increa&s;ed the Follies and Mi&s;eries of Mankind. The more deeply we penetrate into the Labyrinth of Art, the further we find our&s;elves from tho&s;e Ends for which we entered it. This has happen|ed in almo&s;t every Species of Artificial So|ciety, and in all Times. We found, or we thought we found, an Inconvenience in having every Man the Judge of his own Cau&s;e. Therefore Judges were &s;et up, at fir&s;t with di&s;cretionary Powers. But it was &s;oon found a mi&s;erable Slavery to have

our Lives and Properties precarious, and hanging upon the arbitrary Determination of any one Man, or Set of Men. We flew to Laws as a Remedy for this Evil.

Thus we were brought back to our old Incertitude. New Laws were made to expound the old; and new Diffi|culties aro&s;e upon the new Laws; as Words multiplied, Opportunities of cavilling upon them multiplied al&s;o.

<P>The Profe&s;&s;ors of Artificial Law have al|ways walked hand in hand with the Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Artificial Theology. As their End, in confounding the Rea&s;on of Man, and abridging his Natural Freedom, is ex|actly the &s;ame, they have adju&s;ted the Means to that End in a Way entirely &s;imilar. The Divine thunders out his <HI>Anathemas</HI> with more Noi&s;e and Terror again&s;t the Breach of one of his po&s;itive In&s;titutions, or the Neglect of &s;ome of his trivial Forms, than again&s;t the Neglect or

The Delay of the Law is, your Lord&s;hip will tell me, a trite Topick, and which of it's Abu&s;es have not been too &s;everely felt not to be often complained of? A Man's Property is to &s;erve for the Purpo&s;es of his Support; and therefore to delay a Determi|nation concerning that, is the wor&s;t In|ju&s;tice, becau&s;e it cuts off the very End and Purpo&s;e for which I applied to the Judicature for Relief. Quite contrary in Ca&s;e of a Man's Life, there the Determi|nation can hardly be too much protracted. Mi&s;takes in this Ca&s;e are as often fallen into as in any other, and if the Judgement is &s;udden, the Mi&s;takes are the mo&s;t irre|trievable of all others.

In a State of Nature, it is an invariable Law, that a Man's Acqui&s;itions are in proportion to his Labours.

<P>In a Mi&s;ery of this Sort, admit|ing &s;ome few Lenities, and tho&s;e too but a few, nine Parts in ten of the whole Race of Mankind drudge through

Life. It may be urged perhaps, in palliation of this, that, at lea&s;t, the Rich Few find a con&s;iderable and real Benefit from the Wretchedne&s;s of the Many. But is this &s;o in fact? Let us examine the Point with a little more Attention. For this purpo&s;e the Rich in all Societies may be thrown into two Cla&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t is of tho&s;e who are Powerful as well as Rich, and conduct the Operations of the va&s;t Political Ma|chine. The other is of tho&s;e who employ their Riches wholly in the Acqui&s;ition of Plea&s;ure. As to the fir&s;t Sort, their con|tinual Care, Anxiety, their toil&s;ome Days and &s;leeple&s;s Nights, are next to Proverbial. The&s;e Circum&s;tances are &s;ufficient almo&s;t to level their Condition to that of the un|happy Majority; but there are other Cir|cum&s;tances which place them in a far lower Condition. Not only their Under|&s;tandings labour continually, which is the &s;evere&s;t Labour, but their Hearts are torn by the wor&s;t, mo&s;t trouble&s;ome, and in|&s;atiable of all Pa&s;&s;ions, by Avarice, by
<PB N="95" REF="97">
Ambition, by Fear and Jealou&s;y. No part of the Mind has Re&s;t. Power gradually extirpates from the Mind every humane and gentle Virtue. Pity, Benevolence, Friend&s;hip are Things almo&s;t unknown in high Stations. <HI>Verae amicitiae rari&s;&s;ime inveniuntur in iis qui in honoribus reipub|licae ver&s;antur,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Cicero.</HI> And indeed, Courts are the Schools where Cruelty, Pride, Di&s;&s;imulation and Treachery are &s;tudied and taught in the mo&s;t vicious Perfection. This is a Point &s;o clear and acknowledged, that if it did not make a nece&s;&s;ary Part of my Subject, I &s;hould pa&s;s it by entirely. And this has hindered me from drawing at full length, and in the mo&s;t &s;triking Colours, this &s;hocking Picture of the Degeneracy and Wretched|ne&s;s of human Nature, in that Part which is vulgarly thought it's happie&s;t and mo&s;t amiable State. You know from what Originals I could copy &s;uch Pictures. Happy are they who know enough of them to know their little Value, and who
<PB N="96" REF="98">
have been &s;natched from that Po&s;t of Danger with the Remains of their Virtue; Lo&s;s of Honours, Wealth, Titles and even the Lo&s;s of one's Country is nothing in Ballance with &s;o great an Advantage.</P>
<P>Let us now view the other Species of the Rich, tho&s;e who devote their Time and Fortunes to Idlene&s;s and Plea&s;ure. How much happier are they? The Plea|&s;ures which are agreeable to Nature are within the reach of all, and therefore can form no Di&s;tinction in favour of the Rich. The Plea&s;ures which Art forces up are &s;eldom &s;incere, and never &s;atisfying. What is wor&s;e, this con&s;tant Application to Plea&s;ure takes away from the Enjoyment, or rather turns it into the Nature of a very burthen&s;ome and laborious Bu&s;ine&s;s. It has Con&s;equences yet wor&s;e. It pro|duces a weak valetudinary State of Body, attended by all tho&s;e horrid Di&s;orders, and yet more horrid Methods of Cure, which are the Re&s;ult of Luxury on one hand, and
<PB N="97" REF="99">
the weak and ridiculous Efforts of human Art on the other. Their Plea&s;ures are &s;carcely felt as Plea&s;ures; at the &s;ame time that they bring on Pains and Di&s;ea&s;es, which are felt but too &s;everely. The Mind has it's Share of the Misfortune; it grows lazy and enervate, unwilling and unable to &s;earch for Truth, and utterly uncapable of knowing, much le&s;s of reli&s;hing real Happine&s;s. The Poor by their exce&s;&s;ive Labour, and the Rich by their enormous Luxury, are &s;et upon a Level and made equally ignorant of any Knowledge which might conduce to their Happine&s;s. A di&s;mal View of the Interior of all Civil Society. The lower Part broken and ground down by the mo&s;t cruel Oppre&s;|&s;ion; and the Rich by their artificial Method of Life bringing wor&s;e Evils on them&s;elves, than their Tyranny could po&s;&s;ibly inflict on tho&s;e below them. Very different is the Pro&s;pect of the Na|tural State. Here there is no want which Nature gives, and they can be

&s;en&s;ible of no other Wants, which is not to be &s;upplied by a very moderate degree of Labour; therefore there is no Slavery. Neither is there any Luxury, becau&s;e no &s;ingle Man can &s;upply the Materials of it. Life is &s;imple, and therefore it is happy.</P>
<P>I am con&s;cious, my LORD, that your Politician will urge in his Defence, that this unequal State is highly u&s;eful. That without dooming &s;ome Part of Mankind to extraordinary Toil, the Arts which cul|tivate Life could not be exerci&s;ed. But I demand of this Politician, how &s;uch Arts came to be nece&s;&s;ary? He an&s;wers, that Civil Society could not well exi&s;t without them. So that the&s;e Arts are nece&s;&s;ary to Civil Society, and Civil Society nece&s;&s;ary again to the&s;e Arts. Thus running in a Circle, without Mode&s;ty, and with|out End; and making one Error and Extravagance an Excu&s;e for the other. My Sentiments about the&s;e Arts and their Cau&s;e, I have often di&s;cour&s;ed with my

<P>On the whole, my LORD, if Political Society, in whatever Form, has &s;till made the Many the Property of the Few; if it has introduced Labours unnece&s;&s;ary, Vices and Di&s;ea&s;es unknown, and Plea&s;ures in|compatible with Nature; if in all Coun|tries it abridges the Lives of Millions, and renders tho&s;e of Millions more utterly ab|ject and mi&s;erable, &s;hall we &s;till wor&s;hip &s;o de&s;tructive an Idol, and daily &s;acrifice to it our Health, our Liberty, and our Peace? Or &s;hall we pa&s;s by this mon&s;trous Heap of ab&s;urd Notions, and abominable Practices, thinking we have &s;ufficiently
<PB N="100" REF="104">
di&s;charged our Duty in expo&s;ing the trifling Cheats, and ridiculous Juggles of a few mad, de&s;igning, or ambitious Prie&s;ts? Alas! my LORD, we labour under a mortal Con|&s;umption, whil&s;t we are &s;o anxious about the Cure of a &s;ore Finger. For has not this Leviathan of Civil Power overflowed the Earth with a Deluge of Blood, as if he were made to di&s;port and play therein? We have &s;hewn, that Political Society, on a moderate Calculation, has been the Means of murdering an hundred and forty times the Number of Inhabitants now upon the Earth, during it's &s;hort Exi&s;tence, not upwards of four thou&s;and Years in any Accounts to be depended on. But we have &s;aid nothing of the other, and perhaps as bad Con&s;equence of the&s;e Wars, which &s;pilled &s;uch Seas of Blood, and reduced &s;o many Millions to a mercile&s;s Slavery. But the&s;e are only the Ceremonies performed in the Porch of the Political Temple. Much more horrid ones are &s;een as you enter it. The &s;everal Species of Government vie
<PB N="101" REF="105">
with each other in the Ab&s;urdity of their Con&s;titutions, and the Oppre&s;&s;ion which they make their Subjects endure. Take them under what Form you plea&s;e, they are in Effect but a De&s;poti&s;m, and fall, both in Effect an Appearance too, after a very &s;hort Period, into that cruel and de|te&s;table Species of Tyranny; which I ra|ther call it, becau&s;e we have been educated under another Form, than that this is of wor&s;e Con&s;equences to Mankind. For the free Governments, for the Point of their Space, and the Moment of their Duration, have felt more Confu&s;ion, and committed more flagrant Acts of Tyranny, than the mo&s;t perfect de&s;potick Governments which we have ever known. Turn your Eye next to the Labyrinth of the Law, and the Iniquity conceived in it's intricate Re|ce&s;&s;es. Con&s;ider the Ravages committed in the Bowels of all Commonwealths by Ambition, by Avarice, Envy, Fraud, open Inju&s;tice, and pretended Friend&s;hip; Vices which could draw little Support from a

State of Nature, but which blo&s;&s;om and flouri&s;h in the Rankne&s;s of Political Soci|ety. Revolve our whole Di&s;cour&s;e; add to it all tho&s;e Reflections which your own good Under&s;tanding &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t, and make a &s;trenuous Effort beyond the Reach of Vulgar Philo&s;ophy, to confe&s;s that the Cau&s;e of Artificial Society is more de|fencele&s;s even than that of Artificial Reli|gion; that it is as derogatory from the Honour of the Creator, as &s;ubver&s;ive of human Rea&s;on, and productive of infinitely more Mi&s;chief to the human Race.</P>
<P>If pretended Revelations have cau&s;ed Wars where they were oppo&s;ed, and Slavery where they were received, the pre|tended wi&s;e Inventions of Politicians have done the &s;ame. But the Slavery has been much heavier, the Wars far more bloody, and both more univer&s;al by many Degrees. Shew me any Mi&s;chief produced by the Madne&s;s or Wickedne&s;s of Theologians, and I will &s;hew you an hundred, re&s;ulting
<PB N="103" REF="107">
from the Ambition and Villainy of Con|querors and State&s;men. Shew me an Ab|&s;urdity in Religion, I will undertake to &s;hew you an hundred for one in Political Laws and In&s;titutions. If you &s;ay, that Natural Religion is a &s;ufficient Guide without the foreign Aid of Revelation, on what Principle &s;hould Political Laws become nece&s;&s;ary? Is not the &s;ame Rea&s;on available in Theology and in Politicks? If the Laws of Nature are the Laws of God, is it con&s;i&s;tent with the Divine Wi&s;|dom to pre&s;cribe Rules to us, and leave the Enforcement of them to the Folly of human In&s;titutions? Will you follow Truth but to a certain Point? We are indebted for all our Mi&s;eries to our Di&s;tru&s;t of that Guide, which Providence thought &s;uffici|ent for our Condition, our own Na|tural Rea&s;on, which rejecting both in Human and Divine things, we have given our Necks to the Yoke of Poli|tical and Theological Slavery. We have renounced the Prerogative of Man, and it
<PB N="104" REF="108">
is not wonderful that we &s;hould be treated like Bea&s;ts. But our Mi&s;ery is much the greater, as the Crime we commit in re|jecting the lawful Dominion of our Rea&s;on is greater. If after all, you &s;hould confe&s;s all the&s;e things, yet plead the Nece&s;&s;ity of Political In&s;titutions, weak and wicked as they are, I can argue with equal, perhaps &s;uperior Force concerning the Nece&s;&s;ity of Artificial Religion; and every Step you ad|vance in your Argument, you add a Strength to mine. So that if we are re|&s;olved to &s;ubmit our Rea&s;on and our Liberty to Civil U&s;urpation, we have no|thing to do but to conform as quickly as we can to the vulgar Notions which are connected with this, and take up their Theology as well as their Politicks. But if we think this Nece&s;&s;ity rather imaginary than real, we &s;hould renounce their Dreams of Society, together with their Vi&s;ions of Religion, and vindicate our|&s;elves into perfect Liberty.</P>

You are, my LORD, but ju&s;t entering into the World; I am going out of it. I have played long enough to be heartily tired of the Drama. Whether I have acted my Part in it well or ill, Po&s;terity will judge with more Candor than I, or than the pre&s;ent Age, with our pre&s;ent Pa&s;&s;ions, can po&s;&s;ibly pretend to. For my Part, I quit it without a Sigh, and &s;ubmit to the Sovereign Order without murmur|ing. The nearer we approach to the Goal of Life, the better we begin to under|&s;tand the true Value of our Exi&s;tence, and the real Weight of our Opinions. We &s;et out much in Love with both; but we leave much behind us as we advance. We fir&s;t throw away the Tales along with the Rattles of our Nur&s;es. Tho&s;e of the Prie&s;t keep their hold a little longer; tho&s;e of our Governors the longe&s;t of all. But the Pa&s;&s;ions which prop the&s;e Opinions are withdrawn one after another, and the cool Light of Rea&s;on at the Setting of our Life &s;hews us what a fal&s;e Splendor played upon
