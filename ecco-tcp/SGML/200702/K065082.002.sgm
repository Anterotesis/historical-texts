<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>Reign of Claudius.&mdash;Defeat of the Goths.&mdash;Victories, Triumph, and Death, of Aurelian.</HI></HEAD>
<P>UNDER the deplorable reigns of Valerian and Gallienus, the empire was oppre&s;&s;ed and almo&s;t de&s;troyed by the &s;oldiers, the tyrants, and the barbarians. It was &s;aved by a &s;eries of great princes, who derived their ob&s;cure origin from the martial provinces of Illyricum. Within a period of about thirty years, Claudius, Aurelian, Probus, Diocletian and his colleagues, triumphed over the foreign and dome&s;tic enemies of the &s;tate, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, with the military di&s;|cipline, the &s;trength of the frontiers, and de&s;erved the glorious title of Re&s;torers of the Roman world.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="16">
The removal of an effeminate tyrant made way for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of heroes. The indignation of the people imputed all their calamities to Gallie|nus, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aureolus invades Italy, is defeated and be|&s;ieged at Milan.</NOTE> and the far greater part were, indeed, the con&s;equence of his di&s;&s;olute manners and carele&s;s admini&s;tration. He was even de&s;titute of a &s;en&s;e of honour, which &s;o frequently &s;upplies the ab|&s;ence of public virtue; and as long as he was permitted to enjoy the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Italy, a vic|tory of the barbarians, the lo&s;s of a province, or the rebellion of a general, &s;eldom di&s;turbed the tranquil cour&s;e of his plea&s;ures. At length, a con&s;iderable army, &s;tationed on the Upper Da|nube, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 268.</NOTE> inve&s;ted with the Imperial purple their leader Aureolus; who di&s;daining a confined and barren reign over the mountains of Rhaetia, pa&s;&s;ed the Alps, occupied Milan, threatened Rome, and challenged Gallienus to di&s;pute in the field the &s;overeignty of Italy. The emperor, provoked by the in&s;ult, and alarmed by the in&s;tant danger, &s;uddenly exerted that latent vigour, which &s;ome|times broke through the indolence of his temper. Forcing him&s;elf from the luxury of the palace, he appeared in arms at the head of his legions, and advanced beyond the Po to encounter his compe|titor. The corrupted name of Pontirolo <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pons Aureoli,</HI> thirteen miles from Bergamo, and thirty-two from Milan. See Cluver. Italia Antiq. tom. i. p. 245. Near this place, in the year 1703, the ob&s;tinate battle of Ca&s;&s;ano was fought between the French and Au&s;trians. The excellent relation of the Chevalier de Folard, who was pre&s;ent, gives a very di&s;tinct idea of the ground. See Polybe de Folard, tom. iii. p. 223&mdash;248.</NOTE> &s;till pre&s;erves the memory of a bridge over the Adda, which, during the action, mu&s;t have proved an

object of the utmo&s;t importance to both armies. The Rhaetian u&s;urper, after receiving a total de|feat and a dangerous wound, retired into Milan. The &s;iege of that great city was immediately formed; the walls were battered with every en|gine in u&s;e among the ancients; and Aureolus, doubtful of his internal &s;trength, and hopele&s;s of foreign &s;uccours, already anticipated the fatal con&s;equences of un&s;ucce&s;sful rebellion.</P>
<P>His la&s;t re&s;ource was an attempt to &s;educe the loyalty of the be&s;iegers. He &s;cattered libels through their camp, inviting the troops to de&s;ert an unworthy ma&s;ter, who &s;acrificed the public happine&s;s to his luxury, and the lives of his mo&s;t valuable &s;ubjects to the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picions. The arts of Aureolus diffu&s;ed fears and di&s;content among the principal officers of his rival. A con|&s;piracy was formed by Heraclianus the Praetorian praefect, by Marcian, a general of rank and repu|tation, and by Cecrops, who commanded a nu|merous body of Dalmatian guards. The death of Gallienus was re&s;olved; and notwith&s;tanding their de&s;ire of fir&s;t terminating the &s;iege of Milan, the extreme danger which accompanied every moment's delay, obliged them to ha&s;ten the exe|cution of their daring purpo&s;e. At a late hour of the night, but while the emperor &s;till protracted the plea&s;ures of the table, an alarm was &s;uddenly given, that Aureolus, at the head of all his forces, had made a de&s;perate &s;ally from the town; Gal|lienus, who was never deficient in per&s;onal bra|very, &s;tarted from his &s;ilken couch, and, without
<PB N="4" REF="18" MS="y">
allowing him&s;elf time either to put on his armour or to a&s;&s;emble his guards, he mounted on hor&s;e|back, and rode full &s;peed toward the &s;uppo&s;ed place of the attack. Encompa&s;&s;ed by his declared or concealed enemies, he &s;oon, amid&s;t the noc|turnal tumult, received a mortal dart from an uncertain hand. Before he expired, a patriotic <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 268. March 20. Death of Gallienus.</NOTE> &s;entiment ri&s;ing in the mind of Gallienus, in|duced him to name a de&s;erving &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and it was his la&s;t reque&s;t, that the Imperial ornaments &s;hould be delivered to Claudius, who then com|manded a detached army in the neighbourhood of Pavia. The report at lea&s;t was diligently pro|pagated, and the order cheerfully obeyed by the con&s;pirators, who had already agreed to place Claudius on the throne. On the fir&s;t news of the emperor's death, the troops expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;u&s;|picion and re&s;entment, till the one was removed, and the other a&s;&s;uaged, by a donative of twenty pieces of gold to each &s;oldier. They then ra|tified the election, and acknowledged the merit of their new &s;overeign <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">On the death of Gallienus, &s;ee Trebellius Pollio in Hi&s;t. Au|gu&s;t. p. 181.

the meanne&s;s of his birth. We can only di&s;cover that he was a native of one of the provinces bor|dering on the Danube; that his youth was &s;pent in arms, and that his mode&s;t valour attracted the favour and confidence of Decius. The &s;enate and people already con&s;idered him as an excellent officer, equal to the mo&s;t important tru&s;ts; and cen&s;ured the inattention of Valerian, who &s;uffered him to remain in the &s;ubordinate &s;tation of a tri|bune. But it was not long before that emperor di&s;tingui&s;hed the merit of Claudius, by declaring him general and chief of the Illyrian frontier, with the command of all the troops in Thrace, Mae&s;ia, Dacia, Pannonia, and Dalmatia, the ap|pointments of the praefect of Egypt, the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the procon&s;ul of Africa, and the &s;ure pro&s;pect of the con&s;ul&s;hip. By his victories over the Goths, he de&s;erved from the &s;enate the ho|nour of a &s;tatue, and excited the jealous appre|hen&s;ions of Gallienus. It was impo&s;&s;ible that a &s;oldier could e&s;teem &s;o di&s;&s;olute a &s;overeign, nor is it ea&s;y to conceal a ju&s;t contempt. Some un|guarded expre&s;&s;ions which dropt from Claudius, were officiou&s;ly tran&s;mitted to the royal ear. The emperor's an&s;wer to an officer of confidence, de|&s;cribes in very lively colours his own character and that of the times. <Q>There is not any thing capable of giving me more &s;erious concern, than the intelligence contained in your la&s;t di&s;|patch <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><HI>Notoria,</HI> a periodical and official di&s;patch which the Emperors received from the <HI>frumentarii,</HI> or agents di&s;per&s;ed through the pro|vinces.

I my&s;elf have &s;ent him &s;ome pre&s;ents: be it your care that he accept them with plea&s;ure. Above all, let him not &s;u&s;pect that I am made acquainted with his imprudence. The fear of my anger might urge him to de&s;perate coun&s;els <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Augu&s;t. p. 208.

By &s;uch arts Gallienus &s;oftened the indignation, and di&s;pelled the fears, of his Illyrian general; and, during the remainder of that reign, the for|midable &s;word of Claudius was always drawn in the cau&s;e of a ma&s;ter whom he de&s;pi&s;ed. At la&s;t, indeed, he received from the con&s;pirators the bloody purple of Gallienus: but he had been ab|&s;ent from their camp and coun&s;els; and however he might applaud the deed, we may candidly pre&s;ume that he was innocent of the knowledge of it <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Julian (Orat. i. p. 6.) affirms that Claudius acquired the em|pire in a ju&s;t and even holy manner.

The judgment of the army pro|nounced him worthy of death, and Claudius, after a feeble re&s;i&s;tance, con&s;ented to the execution of the &s;entence. Nor was the zeal of the &s;enate le&s;s ardent in the cau&s;e of their new &s;overeign. They ratified, perhaps with a &s;incere tran&s;port of zeal, the election of Claudius; and as his predece&s;&s;or had &s;hewn him&s;elf the per&s;onal enemy of their order, they exerci&s;ed under the name of ju&s;tice a &s;evere revenge again&s;t his friends and family. The &s;enate was permitted to di&s;charge the un|grateful office of puni&s;hment, and the emperor re&s;erved for him&s;elf the plea&s;ure and merit of ob|taining by his interce&s;&s;ion a general act of indem|nity <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Aurelius Victor in Gallien. The people loudly prayed for the damnation of Gallienus. The &s;enate decreed that his relations and &s;ervants &s;hould be thrown down headlong from the Gemonian &s;tairs.

Such o&s;tentatious clemency di&s;covers le&s;s of the real character of Claudius, than a trifling circum|&s;tance in which he &s;eems to have con&s;ulted only <NOTE PLACE="marg">Clemency and ju&s;tice of Clau|dius.</NOTE> the dictates of his heart. The frequent rebel|lions of the provinces had involved almo&s;t every per&s;on in the guilt of trea&s;on, almo&s;t every e&s;tate in the ca&s;e of confi&s;cation; and Gallienus often di&s;played his liberality, by di&s;tributing among his officers the property of his &s;ubjects. On the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of Claudius, an old woman threw her&s;elf at his feet, and complained that a general of the late emperor had obtained an arbitrary grant of her patrimony. This general was Claudius him|&s;elf, who had not entirely e&s;caped the contagion of the times. The emperor blu&s;hed at the re|proach, but de&s;erved the confidence which &s;he had repo&s;ed in his equity. The confe&s;&s;ion of his fault was accompanied with immediate and ample re&s;titution <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Zonaras, l. xii. p. 137.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the arduous ta&s;k which Claudius had under|taken, <NOTE PLACE="marg">He under|takes the reforma|tion of the army.</NOTE> of re&s;toring the empire to its ancient &s;plen|dour, it was fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to revive among his troops a &s;en&s;e of order and obedience. With the authority of a veteran commander, he repre&s;ented to them, that the relaxation of di&s;cipline had in|troduced a long train of di&s;orders, the effects of which were at length experienced by the &s;oldiers them&s;elves; that a people ruined by oppre&s;&s;ion, and indolent from de&s;pair, could no longer &s;up|ply a numerous army with the means of luxury, or even of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; that the danger of each individual had increa&s;ed with the de&s;poti&s;m of the
<PB N="9" REF="23">
military order, &s;ince princes who tremble on the throne, will guard their &s;afety by the in&s;tant &s;a|crifice of every obnoxious &s;ubject. The emperor expatiated on the mi&s;chiefs of a lawle&s;s caprice which the &s;oldiers could only gratify at the ex|pence of their own blood; as their &s;editious elec|tions had &s;o frequently been followed by civil wars, which con&s;umed the flower of the legions either in the field of battle or in the cruel abu&s;e of victory. He painted in the mo&s;t lively colours the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of the trea&s;ury, the de&s;olation of the provinces, the di&s;grace of the Roman name, and the in&s;olent triumph of rapacious bar|barians. It was again&s;t tho&s;e barbarians, he de|clared, that he intended to point the fir&s;t effort of their arms. Tetricus might reign for a while over the We&s;t, and even Zenobia might pre&s;erve the dominion of the Ea&s;t <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Zonaras on this occa&s;ion mentions Po&s;thumus; but the regi&s;|ters of the &s;enate (Hi&s;t.

<P>The various nations of Germany and Sarmatia, who fought under the Gothic &s;tandard, had al|ready <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 269.

On the banks of the Nie&s;ter, one of the great rivers that di&s;charge them&s;elves into that &s;ea, they con&s;tructed a fleet of two thou&s;and, or even
<PB N="10" REF="24">

Whatever might be the real &s;trength of the Goths, the vigour and &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition were not adequate to the greatne&s;s of the preparations. In their pa&s;&s;age through the Bo&s;phorus, the un|&s;kilful pilots were overpowered by the violence of the current; and while the multitude of their &s;hips were crowded in a narrow channel, many were da&s;hed again&s;t each other, or again&s;t the &s;hore. The barbarians made &s;everal de&s;cents on the coa&s;ts both of Europe and A&s;ia; but the open country was already plundered, and they were repul&s;ed with &s;hame and lo&s;s from the fortified cities which they a&s;&s;aulted. A &s;pirit of di&s;cou|ragement and divi&s;ion aro&s;e in the fleet, and &s;ome of their chiefs &s;ailed away towards the i&s;lands of Crete and Cyprus; but the main body pur&s;uing a more &s;teady cour&s;e, anchored at length near the foot of mount Athos, and a&s;&s;aulted the city of The&s;&s;alonica, the wealthy capital of all the Ma|cedonian provinces. Their attacks, in which they di&s;played a fierce but artle&s;s bravery, were &s;oon interrupted by the rapid approach of Clau|dius, ha&s;tening to a &s;cene of action that de&s;erved the pre&s;ence of a warlike prince at the head of the remaining powers of the empire. Impatient for battle, the Goths immediately broke up their

camp, relinqui&s;hed the &s;iege of The&s;&s;alonica, left their navy at the foot of mount Athos, traver&s;ed the hills of Macedonia, and pre&s;&s;ed forwards to engage the la&s;t defence of Italy.</P>

I. The de|ci&s;ive battle was fought near Nai&s;&s;us, a city of Dardania. The legions at fir&s;t gave way, op|pre&s;&s;ed by numbers, and di&s;mayed by misfortunes. Their ruin was inevitable, had not the abilities of their emperor prepared a &s;ea&s;onable relief. A large detachment ri&s;ing out of the &s;ecret and dif|ficult pa&s;&s;es of the mountains, which, by his or|der, they had occupied, &s;uddenly a&s;&s;ailed the rear of the victorious Goths. The favorable in&s;tant was improved by the activity of Claudius. He revived the courage of his troops, re&s;tored their ranks, and pre&s;&s;ed the barbarians on every &s;ide. Fifty thou&s;and men are reported to have been &s;lain in the battle of Nai&s;&s;us. Several large bodies of barbarians, covering their retreat with a moveable fortification of waggons, retired, or rather e&s;caped, from the field of &s;laughter. II. We may pre&s;ume that &s;ome in&s;urmountable diffi|culty, the fatigue, perhaps, or the di&s;obedience, of the conquerors, prevented Claudius from com|pleting in one day the de&s;truction of the Goths. The war was diffu&s;ed over the provinces of Mae&s;ia, Thrace, and Macedonia, and its opera|tions drawn out into a variety of marches, &s;ur|pri&s;es,
<PB N="13" REF="27">
and tumultuary engagements, as well by &s;ea as by land. When the Romans &s;uffered any lo&s;s, it was commonly occa&s;ioned by their own cowardice or ra&s;hne&s;s; but the &s;uperior talents of the emperor, his perfect knowledge of the coun|try, and his judicious choice of mea&s;ures as well as officers, a&s;&s;ured on mo&s;t occa&s;ions the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms. The immen&s;e booty, the fruit of &s;o many victories, con&s;i&s;ted for the greater part of cattle and &s;laves. A &s;elect body of the Gothic youth was received among the Imperial troops; the remainder was &s;old into &s;ervitude; and &s;o con&s;iderable was the number of female captives, that every &s;oldier obtained to his &s;hare two or three women. A circum&s;tance from which we may conclude, that the invaders entertained &s;ome de&s;igns of &s;ettlement as well as of plunder; &s;ince even in a naval expedition they were accompanied by their families. III. The lo&s;s of their fleet, which was either taken or &s;unk, had intercepted the retreat of the Goths. A va&s;t circle of Ro|man po&s;ts di&s;tributed with &s;kill, &s;upported with firmne&s;s, and gradually clo&s;ing towards a com|mon centre, forced the barbarians into the mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible parts of mount Haemus, where they found a &s;afe refuge, but a very &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. During the cour&s;e of a rigorous winter, in which they were be&s;ieged by the emperor's troops, fa|mine and pe&s;tilence, de&s;ertion and the &s;word, continually dimini&s;hed the impri&s;oned multitude. On the return of &s;pring, nothing appeared in <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 270.</NOTE> arms except a hardy and de&s;perate band, the

After a &s;hort but glorious reign of two years, Claudius expired at Sirmium, amid&s;t the tears and acclamations of his &s;ubjects.

Tho&s;e virtues, however, were celebrated with peculiar zeal and complacency by the courtly writers of the age of Con&s;tantine, who was the great grand|&s;on of Cri&s;pus, the elder brother of Claudius. The voice of flattery was &s;oon taught to repeat, that the gods, who &s;o ha&s;tily had &s;natched Clau|dius from the earth, rewarded his merit and piety by the perpetual e&s;tabli&s;hment of the empire in his family <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">See the life of Claudius by Pollio, and the orations of Ma|mertinus, Eumenius, and Julian.

<P>The reign of Aurelian la&s;ted only four years <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aurelian's &s;ucce&s;sful reign.</NOTE> and about nine months; but every in&s;tant of that &s;hort period was filled by &s;ome memorable at|chievement.

<P>The death of Claudius had revived the faint|ing &s;pirit of the Goths. The troops which guarded the pa&s;&s;es of Mount Haemus, and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">He con|cludes a treaty with the Goths,</NOTE> banks of the Danube, had been drawn away by the apprehen&s;ion of a civil war; and it &s;eems probable that the remaining body of the Gothic and Vandalic tribes embraced the favourable op|portunity, abandoned their &s;ettlements of the Ukraine, traver&s;ed the rivers, and &s;welled with new multitudes the de&s;troying ho&s;t of their coun|trymen. Their united numbers were at length encountered by Aurelian, and the bloody and doubtful conflict ended only with the approach of night <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Zo&s;im. l. i. p. 45.</NOTE>. Exhau&s;ted by &s;o many calamities, which they had mutually endured and inflicted during a twenty years war, the Goths and the Romans con&s;ented to a la&s;ting and beneficial treaty. It was earne&s;tly &s;olicited by the barba|rians, and cheerfully ratified by the legions, to who&s;e &s;uffrage the prudence of Aurelian referred the deci&s;ion of that important que&s;tion. The
<PB N="19" REF="33">
Gothic nation engaged to &s;upply the armies of Rome with a body of two thou&s;and auxiliaries, con&s;i&s;ting entirely of cavalry, and &s;tipulated in return an undi&s;turbed retreat, with a regular market as far as the Danube, provided by the emperor's care, but at their own expence. The treaty was ob&s;erved with &s;uch religious fidelity, that when a party of five hundred men &s;traggled from the camp in que&s;t of pluner, the king or general of the barbarians commanded that the guilty leader &s;hould be apprehended and &s;hot to death with darts, as a victim devoted to the &s;anctity of their engagements. It is, however, not unlikely, that the precaution of Aurelian, who had exacted as ho&s;tages the &s;ons and daugh|ters of the Gothic chiefs, contributed &s;omething to this pacific temper. The youths he trained in the exerci&s;e of arms, and near his own per&s;on: to the dam&s;els he gave a liberal and Roman edu|cation, and by be&s;towing them in marriage on &s;ome of his principal officers, gradually intro|duced between the two nations the clo&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t endearing connexions <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">Dexippus (ap.

Their &s;ituation and a&s;toni&s;hment gave him an ea&s;y victory; his &s;kilful conduct improved the advantage.

<P>SUCH was the unhappy condition of the Ro|man emperors, that, whatever might be their conduct, their fate was commonly the &s;ame. A <NOTE PLACE="marg">Extraordi|nary con|te&s;t be|tween the army and the &s;enate for the choice of an empe|ror.</NOTE> life of plea&s;ure or virtue, of &s;everity or mildne&s;s, of indolence or glory, alike led to an untimely grave; and almo&s;t every reign is clo&s;ed by the &s;ame di&s;gu&s;ting repetition of trea&s;on and murder. The death of Aurelian, however, is remarkable by its extraordinary con&s;equences. The legions admired, lamented, and revenged, their victo|rious chief. The artifice of his perfidious &s;ecre|tary was di&s;covered and puni&s;hed. The deluded con&s;pirators attended the funeral of their injured &s;overeign, with &s;incere or well-feigned contri|tion, and &s;ubmitted to the unanimous re&s;olution of the military order, which was &s;ignified by the following epi&s;tle. <Q>The brave and fortunate armies to the &s;enate and people of Rome.

Such honours as fear and perhaps e&s;teem could extort, they liberally poured forth on the memory of their decea&s;ed &s;overeign. Such acknowledgments as gratitude could in|&s;pire, they returned to the faithful armies of the republic, who entertained &s;o ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e of the legal authority of the &s;enate in the choice of an emperor. Yet, notwith&s;tanding this flattering appeal, the mo&s;t prudent of the a&s;&s;embly declined expo&s;ing their &s;afety and dignity to the caprice of an armed multitude. The &s;trength of the le|gions was, indeed, a pledge of their &s;incerity, &s;ince tho&s;e who may command are &s;eldom re|duced to the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;&s;embling; but could it naturally be expected, that a ha&s;ty repentance would correct the inveterate habits of four&s;core years? Should the &s;oldiers relap&s;e into their ac|cu&s;tomed &s;editions, their in&s;olence might di&s;grace the maje&s;ty of the &s;enate, and prove fatal to the object of its choice. Motives like the&s;e dictated a decree, by which the election of a new em|peror was referred to the &s;uffrage of the military order.</P>

Zo&s;imus and Zonaras appear as ignorant of this tran&s;action as they were in ge|neral of the Roman con&s;titution.</NOTE>. The troops, as if &s;atiated <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 275. Feb. 3.</NOTE> with the exerci&s;e of power, again conjured the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A peaceful interreg|num of eight months.</NOTE> &s;enate to inve&s;t one of its own body with the Im|perial purple. The &s;enate &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in its re|fu&s;al; the army in its reque&s;t. The reciprocal offer was pre&s;&s;ed and rejected at lea&s;t three times, and whil&s;t the ob&s;tinate mode&s;ty of either party was re&s;olved to receive a ma&s;ter from the hands of the other, eight months in&s;en&s;ibly elap&s;ed: an amazing period of tranquil anarchy, during which the Roman world remained without a &s;overeign, without an u&s;urper, and without a &s;edition. The generals and magi&s;trates appointed by Aurelian continued to execute their ordinary functions; and it is ob&s;erved, that a procon&s;ul of A&s;ia was the only con&s;iderable per&s;on removed from his office, in the whole cour&s;e of the interregnum.</P>
<P>An event &s;omewhat &s;imilar, but much le&s;s au|thentic, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened after the death of Romulus, who, in his life and character, bore &s;ome affinity with Aurelian. The throne was vacant during twelve months, till the elec|tion of a Sabine philo&s;opher, and the public peace was guarded in the &s;ame manner, by the union of the &s;everal orders of the &s;tate. But, in the
<PB N="60" REF="75">

The decline of the Roman &s;tate, far different from its infancy, was attended with every cir|cum&s;tance that could bani&s;h from an interregnum the pro&s;pect of obedience and harmony: an im|men&s;e and tumultuous capital, a wide extent of empire, the &s;ervile equality of de&s;poti&s;m, an army of four hundred thou&s;and mercenaries, and the experience of frequent revolutions. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e temptations, the di&s;ci|pline and memory of Aurelian &s;till re&s;trained the &s;editious temper of the troops, as well as the fatal ambition of their leaders. The flower of the legions maintained their &s;tations on the banks of the Bo&s;phorus, and the Imperial &s;tandard awed the le&s;s powerful camps of Rome and of the pro|vinces.

<P>Since the expedition of Maximin, the Roman <NOTE PLACE="marg">and car|ries his arms into Germany.</NOTE> generals had confined their ambition to a defen|&s;ive war again&s;t the nations of Germany, who perpetually pre&s;&s;ed on the frontiers of the em|pire.

He exacted a &s;trict re&s;titution of the effects and captives which they had carried away from the provinces; and obliged their own magi&s;trates to puni&s;h the more ob&s;tinate robbers who pre&s;umed to detain any part of the &s;poil. A con&s;iderable tribute of corn, cattle, and hor&s;es, the only wealth of bar|barians, was re&s;erved for the u&s;e of the garri&s;ons which Probus e&s;tabli&s;hed on the limits of their territory. He even entertained &s;ome thoughts of compelling the Germans to relinqui&s;h the exerci&s;e of arms, and to tru&s;t their differences to the ju&s;tice, their &s;afety to the power, of Rome.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the vigilance and activity of Probus, it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that he could at <NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of Saturni|nus in the Ea&s;t;</NOTE> once contain in obedience every part of his wide-extended dominions.

<P>When the emperor Carus undertook the Per|&s;ian war, he was induced, by motives of affection as well as policy, to &s;ecure the fortunes of his family, by leaving in the hands of his elde&s;t &s;on the armies and provinces of the We&s;t.

But the elevation of Con&s;tantius was for a while deferred; and as &s;oon as the father's death had relea&s;ed Carinus from the controul of fear or decency, he di&s;played to the Romans the extravagancies of Elagabalus, aggravated by the cruelty of Domitian <NOTE N="82" PLACE="foot">Vopi&s;cus in Hi&s;t.

<P>AS the reign of Diocletian was more illu&s;|trious than that of any of his predece&s;&s;ors, &s;o was his birth more abject and ob&s;cure. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Elevation and cha|racter of Diocleti|an.</NOTE> The &s;trong claims of merit and of violence had frequently &s;uper&s;eded the ideal prerogatives of nobility; but a di&s;tinct line of &s;eparation was <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 285.</NOTE> hitherto pre&s;erved between the free and the &s;er|vile part of mankind. The parents of Diocle|tian had been &s;laves in the hou&s;e of Anulinus, a Roman &s;enator; nor was he him&s;elf di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by any other name, than that which he derived from a &s;mall town in Dalmatia, from whence his mother deduced her origin <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Eutrop. ix. 19. Victor in Epitom. The town &s;eems to have been properly called Doclia, from a &s;mall tribe of Illyrians (&s;ee Cellarius, Geograph.

He likewi&s;e a&s;&s;umed the Patrician name of Valerius, and it is u&s;ually given him by Aurelius Victor.</NOTE>. It is, however, probable, that his father obtained the freedom of the family, and that he &s;oon acquired an office of &s;cribe, which was commonly exer|ci&s;ed

Favourable oracles, or rather the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uperior merit, prompted his a&s;piring &s;on to pur&s;ue the profe&s;&s;ion of arms and the hopes of fortune; and it would be extremely curious to ob&s;erve the gradation of arts and accidents which enabled him in the end to fulfil tho&s;e oracles, and to di&s;|play that merit to the world. Diocletian was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively promoted to the government of Mae|&s;ia, the honours of the con&s;ul&s;hip, and the im|portant command of the guards of the palace. He di&s;tingui&s;hed his abilities in the Per&s;ian war; and, after the death of Numerian, the &s;lave, by the confe&s;&s;ion and judgment of his rivals, was declared the mo&s;t worthy of the Imperial throne. The malice of religious zeal, whil&s;t it arraigns the &s;avage fiercene&s;s of his colleague Maximian, has affected to ca&s;t &s;u&s;picions on the per&s;onal courage of the emperor Diocletian <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lactantius (or whoever was the author of the little treati&s;e De Mortibus Per&s;ecutorum) accu&s;es Diocletian of <HI>timidity</HI> in two places, c. 7, 8.

Yet even calumny is &s;agacious enough to di&s;cover and to attack the mo&s;t vulnerable part. The valour of Dio|cletian was never found inadequate to his duty or to the occa&s;ion; but he appears not to have
<PB N="114" REF="129">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the daring and generous &s;pirit of a hero, who courts danger and fame, di&s;dains artifice, and boldly challenges the allegiance of his equals. His abilities were u&s;eful rather than &s;plendid; a vigorous mind, improved by the experience and &s;tudy of mankind; dexterity and application in bu&s;ine&s;s; a judicious mixture of liberality and oeconomy, of mildne&s;s and rigour; profound di&s;&s;imulation under the di&s;gui&s;e of military frank|ne&s;s; &s;teadine&s;s to pur&s;ue his ends; flexibility to vary his means; and above all, the great art of &s;ubmitting his own pa&s;&s;ions, as well as tho&s;e of others, to the intere&s;t of his ambition, and of colouring his ambition with the mo&s;t &s;pecious pretences of ju&s;tice and public utility. Like Augu&s;tus, Diocletian may be con&s;idered as the founder of a new empire. Like the adopted &s;on of Cae&s;ar, he was di&s;tingui&s;hed as a &s;tate&s;man rather than as a warrior; nor did either of tho&s;e princes employ force, whenever their purpo&s;e could be effected by policy.</P>
<P>The victory of Diocletian was remarkable for <NOTE PLACE="marg">His cle|mency and victory.</NOTE> its &s;ingular mildne&s;s. A people accu&s;tomed to applaud the clemency of the conqueror, if the u&s;ual puni&s;hments of death, exile, and confi&s;|cation were inflicted with any degree of temper and equity, beheld, with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing a&s;to|ni&s;hment, a civil war, the flames of which were extingui&s;hed in the field of battle. Diocletian received into his confidence Ari&s;tobulus, the principal mini&s;ter of the hou&s;e of Carus, re&s;pect|ed the lives, the fortunes, and the dignity of his adver&s;aries, and even continued in their re&s;pec|tive

&s;tations the greater number of the &s;ervants of Carinus <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">In this encomium, Aurelius Victor &s;eems to convey a ju&s;t, though indirect, cen&s;ure of the cruelty of Con&s;tantius.

It is not improbable that motives of prudence might a&s;&s;i&s;t the humanity of the art|ful Dalmatian; of the&s;e &s;ervants, many had pur|cha&s;ed his favour by &s;ecret treachery; in others, he e&s;teemed their grateful fidelity to an unfor|tunate ma&s;ter.

Such a con|duct, however, di&s;played to the Roman world the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of the new reign, and the emperor affected to confirm this favourable pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by declaring, that, among all the vir|tues of his predece&s;&s;ors, he was the mo&s;t ambi|tious of imitating the humane philo&s;ophy of Marcus Antoninus <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Aurelius Victor &s;tyles Diocletian, "Parentem potius quam Dominum."

<PB N="116" REF="131">
motives of his conduct, as well as the object of his choice, were of a very different nature from tho&s;e of his admired predece&s;&s;or. By inve&s;ting a luxurious youth with the honours of the purple, Marcus had di&s;charged a debt of private grati|tude, at the expence, indeed, of the happine&s;s of the &s;tate. By a&s;&s;ociating a friend and a fel|low-&s;oldier to the labours of government, Dio|cletian, in a time of public danger, provided for the defence both of the Ea&s;t and of the We&s;t. Maximian was born a pea&s;ant, and, like Aure|lian, in the territory of Sirmium. Ignorant of letters <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">In an oration delivered before him (Panegyr. Vet. ii. 8.), Ma|mertinus expre&s;&s;es a doubt whether his hero, in imitating the con|duct of Hannibal and Scipio, had ever heard of their names. From thence we may fairly infer, that Maximian was more de&s;irous of being con&s;idered as a &s;oldier than as a man of letters: and it is in this manner that we can often tran&s;late the language of flattery into that of truth.</NOTE>, carele&s;s of laws, the ru&s;ticity of his appearance and manners &s;till betrayed in the mo&s;t elevated fortune the meanne&s;s of his ex|traction. War was the only art which he pro|fe&s;&s;ed. In a long cour&s;e of &s;ervice he had di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf on every frontier of the em|pire; and though his military talents were form|ed to obey rather than to command, though, perhaps, he never attained the &s;kill of a con|&s;ummate general, he was capable, by his valour, con&s;tancy, and experience, of executing the mo&s;t
<PB N="117" REF="132">
arduous undertakings. Nor were the vices of Maximian le&s;s u&s;eful to his benefactor. In&s;en|&s;ible to pity, and fearle&s;s of con&s;equences, he was the ready in&s;trument of every act of cruelty which the policy of that artful prince might at once &s;ugge&s;t and di&s;claim. As &s;oon as a bloody &s;acrifice had been offered to prudence or to re|venge, Diocletian, by his &s;ea&s;onable interce&s;&s;ion, &s;aved the remaining few whom he had never de&s;igned to puni&s;h, gently cen&s;ured the &s;everity of his &s;tern colleague, and enjoyed the compa|ri&s;on of a golden and an iron age, which was univer&s;ally applied to their oppo&s;ite maxims of government. Notwith&s;tanding the difference of their characters, the two emperors maintained, on the throne, that friend&s;hip which they had contracted in a private &s;tation. The haughty turbulent &s;pirit of Maximian, &s;o fatal afterwards to him&s;elf and to the public peace, was accu&s;|tomed to re&s;pect the genius of Diocletian, and confe&s;&s;ed the a&s;cendant of rea&s;on over brutal violence <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Lactantius de M.

Dr. Stukely, however, (Hi&s;t. of Carau&s;ius, p. 62.) chu&s;es to make him a native of St. David's, and a prince of the blood royal of Britain.

The &s;ecret motive of Nar&s;es in this delay, had been to collect &s;uch a military force, as might enable him, though &s;incerely de&s;irous of peace, to negociate with the greater weight and dignity.

There is no difficulty in conceiving the intention of the Roman princes to improve their revenue by &s;ome re&s;traints upon commerce; but as Ni&s;ibis was &s;ituated within their own domi|nions, and as they were ma&s;ters both of the im|ports and exports, it &s;hould &s;eem, that &s;uch re|&s;traints were the objects of an internal law, rather than of a foreign treaty. To render them more effectual, &s;ome &s;tipulations were probably re|quired on the &s;ide of the king of Per&s;ia, which appeared &s;o very repugnant either to his intere&s;t or to his dignity, that Nar&s;es could not be per|&s;uaded to &s;ub&s;cribe them. As this was the only article to which he refu&s;ed his con&s;ent, it was no longer in&s;i&s;ted on; and the emperors either &s;uffered the trade to flow in its natural channels, or contented them&s;elves with &s;uch re&s;trictions, as it depended on their own authority to e&s;ta|bli&s;h.</P>

Such lofty epithets were &s;ufficient to elate and &s;atisfy the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive vanity; and if the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Diocletian &s;till declined the title of King, it &s;eems to have been the effect not &s;o much of their moderation as of their delicacy. Wherever the Latin tongue was in u&s;e (and it was the lan|guage of government throughout the empire), the Imperial title, as it was peculiar to them|&s;elves, conveyed a more re&s;pectable idea than the name of King, which they mu&s;t have &s;hared with an hundred barbarian chieftains; or which, at the be&s;t, they could derive only from Romulus or from Tarquin.

In their civil government, the emperors were &s;uppo&s;ed to exerci&s;e the undivided power of the monarch, and their edicts, in&s;cribed with their joint names, were received in all the provinces, as promulgated by their mutual councils and authority.

the political union of the Roman world was gra|dually di&s;&s;olved, and a principle of divi&s;ion was introduced, which, in the cour&s;e of a few years, occa&s;ioned the perpetual &s;eparation of the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern empires.</P>

<P>THE balance of power e&s;tabli&s;hed by Dio|cletian &s;ub&s;i&s;ted no longer than while it was &s;u&s;tained by the firm and dexterous hand of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Period of civil wars and confu|&s;ion.</NOTE> the founder. It required &s;uch a fortunate mix|ture of different tempers and abilities, as could &s;carcely be found or even expected a &s;econd time; <NOTE PLACE="marg">A. D. 305&mdash;323.</NOTE> two emperors without jealou&s;y, two Cae&s;ars with|out ambition, and the &s;ame general intere&s;t in|variably pur&s;ued by four independent princes. The abdication of Diocletian and Maximian was &s;ucceeded by eighteen years of di&s;cord and con|fu&s;ion. The empire was afflicted by five civil wars; and the remainder of the time was not &s;o much a &s;tate of tranquillity as a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms between &s;everal ho&s;tile monarchs, who, viewing each other with an eye of fear and hatred, &s;trove to increa&s;e their re&s;pective forces at the expence of their &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Diocletian and Maximian had re|&s;igned the purple, their &s;tation, according to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Character and &s;itua|tion of Con&s;tan|tius.</NOTE> rules of the new con&s;titution, was filled by the

two Cae&s;ars, Con&s;tantius and Galerius, who im|mediately a&s;&s;umed the title of Augu&s;tus <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">M. de Monte&s;quieu (Con&s;iderations &s;ur la Grandeur et la Deca|dence des Romains, c. 17.) &s;uppo&s;es, on the authority of Oro&s;ius and Eu&s;ebius, that, on this occa&s;ion, the empire, for the fir&s;t time, was <HI>really</HI> divided into two parts. It is difficult, however, to di&s;|cover in what re&s;pect the plan of Galerius differed from that of Dio|cletian.</NOTE>. The honours of &s;eniority and precedence were allowed to the former of tho&s;e princes, and he continued, under a new appellation, to admini&s;ter his ancient department of Gaul, Spain, and Britain. The government of tho&s;e ample provinces was &s;uffi|cient to exerci&s;e his talents, and to &s;atisfy his ambition. Clemency, temperance, and mode|ration, di&s;tingui&s;hed the amiable character of Con&s;tantius, and his fortunate &s;ubjects had fre|quently occa&s;ion to compare the virtues of their &s;overeign with the pa&s;&s;ions of Maximian, and even with the arts of Diocletian <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Hic non modo amabilis, &s;ed etiam venerabilis Gallis &s;uit; praecipue qu&ograve;d Diocletiani &s;u&s;pectam prudentiam, et Maximiani &s;anguinariam violentiam imperio ejus eva&s;erant. Eutrop. Breviar. x. 1.</NOTE>. In&s;tead of imitating their ea&s;tern pride and magnificence, Con&s;tantius pre&s;erved the mode&s;ty of a Roman prince. He declared, with unaffected &s;incerity, that his mo&s;t valued trea&s;ure was in the hearts of his people, and that, whenever the dignity of the throne, or the danger of the &s;tate, required any extraordinary &s;upply, he could depend with con|fidence on their gratitude and liberality <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Divitiis Provincialium (mel. <HI>provinciarum)</HI> ac privatorum &s;tudens, fi&s;ci commoda non admodum affectans; ducen&s;que melius publicas opes a privatis haberi, quam intra unum clau&s;trum re&s;ervari.

<P>The &s;tern temper of Galerius was ca&s;t in a very different mould; and while he commanded <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Gale|rius.</NOTE> the e&s;teem of his &s;ubjects, he &s;eldom conde&s;cended to &s;olicit their affections. His fame in arms, and above all, the &s;ucce&s;s of the Per&s;ian war, had elated his haughty mind, which was naturally impatient of a &s;uperior, or even of an equal. If it were po&s;&s;ible to rely on the partial te&s;timony of an injudicious writer, we might a&s;cribe the abdication of Diocletian to the menaces of Ga|lerius, and relate the particulars of a <HI>private</HI> con|ver&s;ation between the two princes, in which the former di&s;covered as much pu&s;illanimity as the latter di&s;played ingratitude and arrogance <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Lactantius de Mort.

But the&s;e ob&s;cure anecdotes are &s;ufficiently refuted by an impartial view of the character and conduct of Diocletian. Whatever might otherwi&s;e have been his intentions, if he had apprehended any
<PB N="188" REF="203">
danger from the violence of Galerius, his good &s;en&s;e would have in&s;tructed him to prevent the ignominious conte&s;t; and as he had held the &s;ceptre with glory, he would have re&s;igned it without di&s;grace.</P>
<P>After the elevation of Con&s;tantius and Galerius <NOTE PLACE="marg">The two Cae&s;ars, Severus and Max|imin.</NOTE> to the rank of <HI>Augu&s;ti,</HI> two new <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> were re|quired to &s;upply their place, and to complete the &s;y&s;tem of the Imperial government. Dio|cletian was &s;incerely de&s;irous of withdrawing him|&s;elf from the world; he con&s;idered Galerius, who had married his daughter, as the firme&s;t &s;upport of his family and of the empire; and he con|&s;ented, without reluctance, that his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the merit as well as the envy of the important nomination. It was fixed without con&s;ulting the intere&s;t or inclination of the princes of the We&s;t. Each of them had a &s;on who was arrived at the age of manhood, and who might have been deemed the mo&s;t natural candidates for the vacant honour. But the impotent re&s;ent|ment of Maximian was no longer to be dreaded; and the moderate Con&s;tantius, though he might de&s;pi&s;e the dangers, was humanely apprehen&s;ive of the calamities of civil war. The two per&s;ons whom Galerius promoted to the rank of Cae&s;ar, were much better &s;uited to &s;erve the views of his ambition; and their principal recommendation &s;eems to have con&s;i&s;ted in the want of merit or per&s;onal con&s;equence. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was Daza, or, as he was afterwards called, Maximin, who&s;e mother was the &s;i&s;ter of Galerius. The

unexperienced youth &s;till betrayed by his man|ners and language his ru&s;tic education, when, to his own a&s;toni&s;hment as well as that of the world, he was inve&s;ted by Diocletian with the purple, exalted to the dignity of Cae&s;ar, and intru&s;ted with the &s;overeign command of Egypt and Syria <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Sublatus nuper a pecoribus et &s;ilvis (&s;ays Lactantius de M.

At the &s;ame time, Severus, a faithful &s;ervant, addicted to plea&s;ure, but not incapable of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, was &s;ent to Milan, to receive from the re|luctant hands of Maximian the Cae&s;arean orna|ments, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Italy and Africa <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">His diligence and fidelity are acknowledged even by Lactantius, de M.

According to the forms of the con&s;titution, Se|verus acknowledged the &s;upremacy of the we&s;t|ern emperor; but he was ab&s;olutely devoted to the commands of his benefactor Galerius, who, re&s;erving to him&s;elf the intermediate countries from the confines of Italy to tho&s;e of Syria, firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed his power over three-fourths of the monarchy. In the full confidence, that the approaching death of Con&s;tantius would leave him &s;ole ma&s;ter of the Roman world, we are a&s;|&s;ured that he had arranged in his mind a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of future princes, and that he medi|tated his own retreat from public life, after he &s;hould have accompli&s;hed a glorious reign of about twenty years <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The&s;e &s;chemes, however, re&s;t only on the very doubtful autho|rity of Lactantius, de M.

But within le&s;s than eighteen months, two un|expected revolutions overturned the ambitious &s;chemes of Galerius. The hopes of uniting the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambition of Gale|rius di&s;ap|pointed by two revo|lutions.</NOTE> we&s;tern provinces to his empire, were di&s;appoint|ed by the elevation of Con&s;tantine, whil&s;t Italy and Africa were lo&s;t by the &s;ucce&s;sful revolt of Maxentius.</P>

The place of his birth, as well as the condition of his mother Helena, have been the &s;ubject not only of literary but of national di&s;putes. Notwith&s;tanding the recent tradition, which a&s;&s;igns for her father, a Briti&s;h king, we are obliged to confe&s;s, that Helena was the daughter of an innkeeper <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">This tradition, unknown to the contemporaries of Con&s;tantine, was invented in the darkne&s;s of mona&s;teries, was embelli&s;hed by Jeffrey of Monmouth, and the writers of the xiith century, has been defended by our antiquarians of the la&s;t age, and is &s;eriou&s;ly re|lated in the ponderous hi&s;tory of England, compiled by Mr. Carte (vol. i. p. 147.). He tran&s;ports, however, the kingdom of Coil, the imaginary father of Helena, from E&s;&s;ex to the wall of Anto|ninus.</NOTE>; but at the &s;ame time we may defend the legality of her marriage, again&s;t tho&s;e who have repre&s;ented her as the concubine of Con&s;tantius <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Eutropius (x. 2.) expre&s;&s;es, in a few words, the real truth, and the occa&s;ion of the error, "ex ob&s;curiori matrimonio ejus filius." Zo&s;imus (l. ii. p. 78.) eagerly &s;eized the mo&s;t unfavourable report, and is followed by Oro&s;ius (vii. 25.), who&s;e authority is oddly enough overlooked by the indefatigable but partial Tillemont. By in&s;i&s;ting on the divorce of Helena, Diocletian acknowledged her marriage.</NOTE>. The great Con&s;tan|tine was mo&s;t probably born at Nai&s;&s;us, in Da|cia <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">There are three opinions with regard to the place of Con&s;tan|tine's birth. 1. Our Engli&s;h antiquarians were u&s;ed to dwell with rapture on the words of his panegyri&s;t; <Q>Britannias illic oriendo nobiles feci&s;ti.</Q> But this celebrated pa&s;&s;age may be referred with as much propriety to the acce&s;&s;ion as to the nativity of Con&s;tantine. 2. Some of the modern Greeks have a&s;cribed the honour of his birth to Drepanum, a town on the gulph of Nicomedia (Cellarius, tom. ii. p. 174.), which Con&s;tantine dignified with the name of Helenopolis, and Ju&s;tinian adorned with many &s;plendid buildings (Procop. de Aedificiis, v. 2.). It is indeed probable enough, that Helena's father kept an inn at Drepanum; and that Con&s;tantius might lodge there when he returned from a Per&s;ian emba&s;&s;y in the reign of Aurelian. But in the wandering life of a &s;oldier, the place of his marriage, and the places where his children are born, have very little connection with each other. 3. The claim of Nai&s;&s;us is &s;upported by the anonymous writer, publi&s;hed at the end of Am|mianus, p. 710, and who in general copied very good materials; and it is confirmed by Julius Firmicius (de A&s;trologi&acirc;, l. i. c. 4.), who flouri&s;hed under the reign of Con&s;tantine him&s;elf. Some ob|jections have been rai&s;ed again&s;t the integrity of the text, and the application of the pa&s;&s;age of Firmicius; but the former is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the be&s;t MSS. and the latter is very ably defended by Lip&s;ius de Magnitudine Romana, l. iv. c. 11. et Supplement.</NOTE>;

The figure of Con&s;tan|tius was tall and maje&s;tic; he was dexterous in all his exerci&s;es, intrepid in war, affable in peace; in his whole conduct, the active &s;pirit of youth was tempered by habitual prudence; and while his mind was engro&s;&s;ed by ambition, he appeared cold and in&s;en&s;ible to the allurements of plea&s;ure. The favour of the people and &s;oldiers, who had named him as a worthy candidate for the rank of Cae&s;ar, &s;erved only to exa&s;perate the jealou&s;y of Galerius; and though prudence might re&s;train him from exerci&s;ing any open violence, an ab|&s;olute monarch is &s;eldom at a lo&s;s how to execute a &s;ure and &s;ecret revenge <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Galerius, or perhaps his own courage, expo&s;ed him to &s;ingle combat with a Sarmatian (Anonym. p. 710.) and with a mon&s;trous lion.

The tranquillity of tho&s;e elegant rece&s;&s;es of ea&s;e and luxury was di&s;turbed by the impatient mur|murs of the Romans; and a report was in&s;en&s;ibly

circulated, that the &s;ums expended in erecting tho&s;e buildings, would &s;oon be required at their hands. About that time the avarice of Galerius, or perhaps the exigencies of the &s;tate, had in|duced him to make a very &s;trict and rigorous in|qui&s;ition into the property of his &s;ubjects for the purpo&s;e of a general taxation, both on their lands and on their per&s;ons. A very minute &s;urvey ap|pears to have been taken of their real e&s;tates; and wherever there was the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion of concealment, torture was very freely employed to obtain a &s;incere declaration of their per&s;onal wealth <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">See Lactantius de M. P. c. 26. 31.</NOTE>. The privileges which had exalted Italy above the rank of the provinces, were no longer regarded: and the officers of the revenue already began to number the Roman people, and to &s;ettle the proportion of the new taxes. Even when the &s;pirit of freedom had been utterly extingui&s;hed, the tame&s;t &s;ubjects have &s;ometimes ventured to re&s;i&s;t an unprecedented inva&s;ion of their property; but on this occa&s;ion the injury was aggravated by the in&s;ult, and the &s;en&s;e of private intere&s;t was quickened by that of national honour. The conque&s;t of Macedonia, as we have already ob|&s;erved, had delivered the Roman people from the weight of per&s;onal taxes. Though they had experienced every form of de&s;poti&s;m, they had now enjoyed that exemption near five hundred years; nor could they patiently brook the in&s;o|lence of an Illyrian pea&s;ant, who, from his di&s;tant re&s;idence in A&s;ia, pre&s;umed to number Rome

among the tributary cities of his empire. The ri&s;ing fury of the people was encouraged by the authority, or at lea&s;t the connivance, of the &s;e|nate; and the feeble remains of the Praetorian guards, who had rea&s;on to apprehend their own di&s;&s;olution, embraced &s;o honourable a pretence, and declared their readine&s;s to draw their &s;words in the &s;ervice of their oppre&s;&s;ed country. It was the wi&s;h, and it &s;oon became the hope, of every citizen, that after expelling from Italy their fo|reign tyrants, they &s;hould elect a prince who, by the place of his re&s;idence, and by his maxims of government, might once more de&s;erve the title of Roman emperor. The name, as well as the &s;ituation, of Maxentius, determined in his favour the popular enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>Maxentius was the &s;on of the emperor Maxi|mian, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Maxentius declared emperor at Rome. A. D. 306. 28th Oct.</NOTE> and he had married the daughter of Gale|rius. His birth and alliance &s;eemed to offer him the faire&s;t promi&s;e of &s;ucceeding to the empire; but his vices and incapacity procured him the &s;ame exclu&s;ion from the dignity of Cae&s;ar, which Con&s;tantine had de&s;erved by a dangerous &s;upe|riority of merit. The policy of Galerius pre|ferred &s;uch a&s;&s;ociates, as would never di&s;grace the choice, nor di&s;pute the commands of their benefactor. An ob&s;cure &s;tranger was therefore rai&s;ed to the throne of Italy, and the &s;on of the late emperor of the We&s;t was left to enjoy the luxury of a private fortune in a villa a few miles di&s;tant from the capital. The gloomy pa&s;&s;ions of his &s;oul, &s;hame, vexation, and rage were in|flamed by envy on the news of Con&s;tantine's &s;uc|ce&s;s;
<PB N="200" REF="215">
but the hopes of Maxentius revived with the public di&s;content, and he was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to unite his per&s;onal injury and preten&s;ions with the cau&s;e of the Roman people. Two Praetorian tribunes and a commi&s;&s;ary of provi&s;ions under|took the management of the con&s;piracy; and as every order of men was actuated by the &s;ame &s;pirit, the immediate event was neither doubtful nor difficult. The praefect of the city, and a few magi&s;trates, who maintained their fidelity to Se|verus, were ma&s;&s;acred by the guards; and Max|entius, inve&s;ted with the Imperial ornaments, was acknowledged by the applauding &s;enate and people as the protector of the Roman freedom and dignity. It is uncertain whether Maximian was previou&s;ly acquainted with the con&s;piracy; but as &s;oon as the &s;tandard of rebellion was erect|ed at Rome, the old emperor broke from the re|tirement <NOTE PLACE="marg">Maximian re-a&s;&s;umes the purple.</NOTE> where the authority of Diocletian had condemned him to pa&s;s a life of melancholy &s;oli|tude, and concealed his returning ambition under the di&s;gui&s;e of paternal tenderne&s;s.

According to the advice, or rather the orders, of his colleague, the emperor Severus immedi|ately ha&s;tened to Rome, in the full confidence, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeat and death of Severus.</NOTE> that, by his unexpected celerity, he &s;hould ea&s;ily &s;uppre&s;s the tumult of an unwarlike populace, commanded by a licentious youth. But he found on his arrival the gates of the city &s;hut again&s;t him, the walls filled with men and arms, an ex|perienced general at the head of the rebels, and his own troops without &s;pirit or affection. A large body of Moors de&s;erted to the enemy, al|lured by the promi&s;e of a large donative; and, if it be true that they had been levied by Maxi|mian in his African war, preferring the natural feelings of gratitude to the artificial ties of alle|giance.

With an art more &s;uitable to the character of Diocletian than to his own, he directed his attack, not &s;o much again&s;t the walls of Ravenna, as again&s;t the mind of Severus. The treachery which he had expe|rienced, di&s;po&s;ed that unhappy prince to di&s;tru&s;t the mo&s;t &s;incere of his friends and adherents.

He was at fir&s;t received with hu|manity, and treated with re&s;pect.

active diligence, that he de&s;cended into the plain of Piedmont before the court of Maxentius had received any certain intelligence of his departure from the banks of the Rhine. The city of Su&s;a, however, which is &s;ituated at the foot of Mount Cenis, was &s;urrounded with walls, and provided with a garri&s;on &s;ufficiently numerous to check the progre&s;s of an invader; but the impatience of Con&s;tantine's troops di&s;dained the tedious forms of a &s;iege. The &s;ame day that they appeared before Su&s;a, they applied fire to the gates, and ladders to the walls; and mount|ing to the a&s;&s;ault amid&s;t a &s;hower of &s;tones and arrows, they entered the place &s;word in hand, and cut in pieces the greate&s;t part of the gar|ri&s;on. The flames were extingui&s;hed by the care of Con&s;tantine, and the remains of Su&s;a pre|&s;erved from total de&s;truction. About forty miles from thence, a more &s;evere conte&s;t awaited him. A numerous army of Italians was a&s;&s;em|bled under the lieutenants of Maxentius in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Turin.</NOTE> plains of Turin. Its principal &s;trength con&s;i&s;ted in a &s;pecies of heavy cavalry, which the Romans, &s;ince the decline of their di&s;cipline, had borrow|ed from the nations of the Ea&s;t. The hor&s;es, as well as the men, were clothed in complete armour, the joints of which were artfully adapted to the motions of their bodies. The a&s;pect of this cavalry was formidable, their weight almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible; and as, on this occa&s;ion, their gene|rals had drawn them up in a compact column or wedge, with a &s;harp point, and with &s;preading

flanks, they flattered them&s;elves that they &s;hould ea&s;ily break and trample down the army of Con|&s;tantine. They might perhaps have &s;ucceeded in their de&s;ign, had not their experienced ad|ver&s;ary embraced the &s;ame method of defence, which in &s;imilar circum&s;tances had been prac|ti&s;ed by Aurelian. The &s;kilful evolutions of Con&s;tantine divided and baffled this ma&s;&s;y co|lumn of cavalry. The troops of Maxentius fled in confu&s;ion towards Turin; and as the gates of the city were &s;hut again&s;t them, very few e&s;cap|ed the &s;word of the victorious pur&s;uers. By this important &s;ervice, Turin de&s;erved to experience the clemency and even favour of the conqueror. He made his entry into the Imperial palace of Milan, and almo&s;t all the cities of Italy between the Alps and the Po not only acknowledged the power, but embraced with zeal the party, of Con&s;tantine <NOTE N="56" PLACE="foot">Zo&s;imus as well as Eu&s;ebius ha&s;ten from the pa&s;&s;age of the Alps, to the deci&s;ive action near Rome.

As &s;oon as he was informed that Con&s;tantine was advancing towards him, he detached a large body of cavalry, which was defeated in an en|gagement near Bre&s;cia, and pur&s;ued by the Gallic legions as far as the gates of Verona. The nece&s;&s;ity, the importance, and the diffi|culties of the &s;iege of Verona, immediately pre|&s;ented them&s;elves to the &s;agacious mind of Con|&s;tantine <NOTE N="57" PLACE="foot">The Marquis Maffei has examined the &s;iege and battle of Ve|rona, with that degree of attention and accuracy, which was due to a memorable action that happened in his native country.

With indefatigable diligence he &s;oon collected an army &s;ufficient either to meet Con|&s;tantine in the field, or to attack him if he ob|&s;tinately remained within his lines. The em|peror, attentive to the motions, and informed of the approach, of &s;o formidable an enemy, left a part of his legions to continue the operations of the &s;iege, whil&s;t, at the head of tho&s;e troops on who&s;e valour and fidelity he more particularly depended, he advanced in per&s;on to engage the general of Maxentius. The army of Gaul was drawn up in two lines, according to the u&s;ual practice of war; but their experienced leader, perceiving that the numbers of the Italians far exceeded his own, &s;uddenly changed his di&s;po&s;i|tion, and reducing the &s;econd, extended the front of his fir&s;t line, to a ju&s;t proportion with that of the enemy. Such evolutions, which only veteran troops can execute without confu&s;ion in a moment of danger, commonly prove deci&s;ive: but as this engagement began towards the clo&s;e of the day, and was conte&s;ted with great ob&s;ti|nacy during the whole night, there was le&s;s room for the conduct of the generals than for the cou|rage of the &s;oldiers.

The prudent father had judged him too young to &s;u&s;tain the weight of a diadem; but he hoped that under the protection of princes, who were indebted to his favour for the Imperial purple, Candidianus might pa&s;s a &s;ecure and honourable life. He was now advancing towards the twentieth year of his age, and the royalty of his birth, though un&s;upported either by merit or ambition, was &s;ufficient to exa&s;perate the jea|lous mind of Licinius <NOTE N="80" PLACE="foot">Lactantius de M.

But the per|formance of the promi&s;ed favour was either at|tended with &s;o much delay, or accompanied with &s;o many unequal conditions, that the fidelity of Ba&s;&s;ianus was alienated rather than &s;ecured by the honourable di&s;tinction which he had obtained. His nomination had been ratified by the con&s;ent of Licinius, and that artful prince, by the means of his emi&s;&s;aries, &s;oon contrived to enter into a &s;ecret and dangerous corre&s;pondence with the new Cae&s;ar, to irritate his di&s;contents, and to urge him to the ra&s;h enterpri&s;e of extorting by violence what he might in vain &s;olicit from the ju&s;tice of Con&s;tantine. But the vigilant emperor di&s;covered the con&s;piracy before it was ripe for execution; and, after &s;olemnly renouncing the alliance of Ba&s;&s;ianus, de&s;poiled him of the pur|ple, and inflicted the de&s;erved puni&s;hment on his trea&s;on and ingratitude. The haughty refu&s;al of Licinius, when he was required to deliver up the criminals, who had taken refuge in his domi|nions, confirmed the &s;u&s;picions already enter|tained of his perfidy; and the indignities offered at Aemona, on the frontiers of Italy, to the &s;tatues of Con&s;tantine, became the &s;ignal of di&s;cord be|tween the two princes <NOTE N="87" PLACE="foot">The &s;ituation of Aemona, or, as it is now called, Laybach, in Carniola (d'Anville Geographie Ancienne, tom. i. p. 187.), may &s;ugge&s;t a conjecture.

He pur&s;ued his &s;ucce&s;s, and advanced into the plain.

<P>In&s;tead of embracing &s;uch an active re&s;olution, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Hadriano|ple. A. D. 323. July 3.</NOTE> which might have changed the whole face of the war, the prudent Licinius expected the approach of his rival in a camp near Hadrianople, which he had fortified with an anxious care that be|trayed his apprehen&s;ion of the event. Con&s;tan|tine directed his march from The&s;&s;alonica to|wards that part of Thrace, till he found him&s;elf &s;topped by the broad and rapid &s;tream of the Hebrus, and di&s;covered the numerous army of Licinius, which filled the &s;teep a&s;cent of the hill, from the river to the city of Hadrianople. Many days were &s;pent in doubtful and di&s;tant &s;kir|mi&s;hes; but at length the ob&s;tacles of the pa&s;&s;age and of the attack were removed by the intrepid conduct of Con&s;tantine. In this place we might relate a wonderful exploit of Con&s;tantine, which, though it can &s;carcely be paralleled either in po|etry or romance, is celebrated, not by a venal orator devoted to his fortune, but by an hi&s;to|rian, the partial enemy of his fame. We are

a&s;&s;ured that the valiant emperor threw him&s;elf into the river Hebrus, accompanied only by <HI>twelve</HI> hor&s;emen, and that by the effort or terror of his invincible arm, he broke, &s;laughtered, and put to &s;light a ho&s;t of an hundred and fifty thou|&s;and men. The credulity of Zo&s;imus prevailed &s;o &s;trongly over his pa&s;&s;ion, that among the events of the memorable battle of Hadrianople, he &s;eems to have &s;elected and embelli&s;hed, not the mo&s;t important, but the mo&s;t marvellous. The valour and danger of Con&s;tantine are atte&s;ted by a &s;light wound which he received in the thigh, but it may be di&s;covered even from an imperfect narration, and perhaps a corrupted text, that the victory was obtained no le&s;s by the conduct of the general than by the courage of the hero; that a body of five thou&s;and archers marched round to occupy a thick wood in the rear of the enemy, who&s;e attention was diverted by the con|&s;truction of a bridge, and that Licinius, per|plexed by &s;o many artful evolutions, was reluc|tantly drawn from his advantageous po&s;t to com|bat on equal ground in the plain. The conte&s;t was no longer equal. His confu&s;ed multitude of new levies was ea&s;ily vanqui&s;hed by the ex|perienced veterans of the We&s;t. Thirty-four thou&s;and men are reported to have been &s;lain.

<P>The &s;iege of Byzantium, which was immedi|ately <NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Byzanti|um, and naval vic|tory of Cri&s;pus.</NOTE> undertaken by Con&s;tantine, was attended with great labour and uncertainty. In the late civil wars, the fortifications of that place, &s;o ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the key of Europe and A&s;ia, had been repaired and &s;trengthened; and as long as Licinius remained ma&s;ter of the &s;ea, the gar|ri&s;on was much le&s;s expo&s;ed to the danger of fa|mine than the army of the be&s;iegers. The naval commanders of Con&s;tantine were &s;ummoned to his camp, and received his po&s;itive orders to force the pa&s;&s;age of the Helle&s;pont, as the fleet of Licinius, in&s;tead of &s;eeking and de&s;troying their feeble enemy, continued inactive in tho&s;e narrow &s;treights where its &s;uperiority of numbers was of little u&s;e or advantage.

As &s;oon as the Helle&s;pont was open, a plentiful convoy of provi&s;ions flowed into the camp of Con&s;tantine, who had already advanced the operations of the &s;iege. He con&s;tructed ar|tificial mounds of earth of an equal height with the ramparts of Byzantium. The lofty towers which were erected on that foundation, galled the be&s;ieged with large &s;tones and darts from the military engines, and the battering rams had &s;haken the walls in &s;everal places. If Licinius per&s;i&s;ted much longer in the defence, he expo&s;ed him&s;elf to be involved in the ruin, of the place.

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. <HI>The Progre&s;s of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and the Sen|timents, Manners, Numbers, and Condition, of the primitive Chri&s;tians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A CANDID but rational inquiry into the pro|gre&s;s and e&s;tabli&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity, may be con&s;idered as a very e&s;&s;ential part of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Import|ance of the inquiry.</NOTE> hi&s;tory of the Roman empire. While that great body was invaded by open violence, or under|mined by &s;low decay, a pure and humble religion gently in&s;inuated it&s;elf into the minds of men, grew up in &s;ilence and ob&s;curity, derived new vigour from oppo&s;ition, and finally erected the triumphant banner of the cro&s;s on the ruins of the Capitol. Nor was the influence of Chri&s;ti|anity confined to the period or to the limits of the Roman empire. After a revolution of thir|teen or fourteen centuries, that religion is &s;till profe&s;&s;ed by the nations of Europe, the mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed portion of human kind in arts and learning as well as in arms. By the indu&s;try and zeal of the Europeans, it has been widely diffu&s;ed to the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;hores of A&s;ia and Africa; and by the means of their colonies has been firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed from Canada to Chili, in a world unknown to the ancients.</P>
<P>But this inquiry, however u&s;eful or entertain|ing, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Its difficul|ties.</NOTE> is attended with two peculiar difficulties. The &s;canty and &s;u&s;picious materials of eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal

hi&s;tory &s;eldom enable us to di&s;pel the dark cloud that hangs over the fir&s;t age of the church. The great law of impartiality too often obliges us to reveal the imperfections of the unin&s;pired teachers and believers of the go&s;pel; and, to a carele&s;s ob&s;erver, <HI>their</HI> faults may &s;eem to ca&s;t a &s;hade on the faith which they profe&s;&s;ed. But the &s;candal of the pious Chri&s;tian, and the fallacious triumph of the Infidel, &s;hould cea&s;e as &s;oon as they recollect not only <HI>by whom,</HI> but likewi&s;e <HI>to whom,</HI> the Divine Revelation was given. The theologian may indulge the plea&s;ing ta&s;k of de|&s;cribing Religion as &s;he de&s;cended from Heaven, arrayed in her native purity. A more melan|choly duty is impo&s;ed on the hi&s;torian. He mu&s;t di&s;cover the inevitable mixture of error and cor|ruption, which &s;he contracted in a long re&s;i|dence upon earth, among a weak and degenerate race of beings.</P>
<P>Our curio&s;ity is naturally prompted to inquire <NOTE PLACE="marg">Five cau&s;es of the growth of Chri&s;tiani|ty.</NOTE> by what means the Chri&s;tian faith obtained &s;o remarkable a victory over the e&s;tabli&s;hed religions of the earth. To this inquiry, an obvious but &s;atisfactory an&s;wer may be returned; that it was owing to the convincing evidence of the doctrine it&s;elf, and to the ruling providence of its great Author. But as truth and rea&s;on &s;eldom find &s;o favourable a reception in the world, and as the wi&s;dom of Providence frequently conde&s;cends to u&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions of the human heart, and the general circum&s;tances of mankind, as in&s;truments to execute its purpo&s;e; we may &s;till be permitted,

It will, perhaps, appear, that it was mo&s;t effectually favoured and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the five following cau&s;es: I. The inflexible, and, if we may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, the intolerant zeal of the Chri&s;tians, derived, it is true, from the Jewi&s;h religion, but purified from the narrow and un|&s;ocial &s;pirit, which, in&s;tead of inviting, had de|terred the Gentiles from embracing the law of Mo&s;es. II. The doctrine of a future life, im|proved by every additional circum&s;tance which could give weight and efficacy to that important truth. III. The miraculous powers a&s;cribed to the primitive church. IV. The pure and au&s;tere morals of the Chri&s;tians. V.

of the cho&s;en people. But the devout and even &s;crupulous attachment to the Mo&s;aic religion, &s;o con&s;picuous among the Jews who lived under the &s;econd temple, becomes &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing, if it is compared with the &s;tubborn incredulity of their forefathers. When the law was given in thunder from Mount Sinai; when the tides of the ocean, and the cour&s;e of the planets were &s;u&s;pended for the convenience of the I&s;raelites; and when temporal rewards and puni&s;hments were the immediate con&s;equences of their piety or di&s;obedience, they perpetually relap&s;ed into rebellion again&s;t the vi&s;ible maje&s;ty of their Di|vine King, placed the idols of the nations in the &s;anctuary of Jehovah, and imitated every fan|ta&s;tic ceremony that was practi&s;ed in the tents of the Arabs, or in the cities of Phoenicia <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">For the enumeration of the Syrian and Arabian deities, it may be ob&s;erved, that Milton has compri&s;ed in one hundred and thirty very beautiful lines, the two large and learned &s;yntagmas, which Selden had compo&s;ed on that ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ubject.</NOTE>. As the protection of Heaven was de&s;ervedly with|drawn from the ungrateful race, their faith ac|quired a proportionable degree of vigour and purity. The contemporaries of Mo&s;es and Jo&s;hua had beheld with carele&s;s indifference the mo&s;t amazing miracles. Under the pre&s;&s;ure of every calamity, the belief of tho&s;e miracles has pre|&s;erved the Jews of a later period from the uni|ver&s;al contagion of idolatry; and in contradiction to every known principle of the human mind, that &s;ingular people &s;eems to have yielded a &s;tronger and more ready a&s;&s;ent to the traditions

<P>The Jewi&s;h religion was admirably fitted for <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their reli|gion better &s;uited to defence than to conque&s;t.</NOTE> defence, but it was never de&s;igned for conque&s;t; and it &s;eems probable that the number of pro|&s;elytes was never much &s;uperior to that of apo&s;|tates. The divine promi&s;es were originally made, and the di&s;tingui&s;hing rite of circumci&s;ion was enjoined to a &s;ingle family. When the po&s;terity of Abraham had multiplied like the &s;ands of the &s;ea, the Deity, from who&s;e mouth they received a &s;y&s;tem of laws and ceremonies, declared him|&s;elf the proper and as it were the national God of I&s;rael; and with the mo&s;t jealous care &s;epa|rated his favourite people from the re&s;t of man|kind. The conque&s;t of the land of Canaan was accompanied with &s;o many wonderful and with &s;o many bloody circum&s;tances, that the victo|rious Jews were left in a &s;tate of irreconcilable ho&s;tility with all their neighbours. They had been commanded to extirpate &s;ome of the mo&s;t idolatrous tribes, and the execution of the Di|vine will had &s;eldom been retarded by the weak|ne&s;s of humanity. With the other nations they were forbidden to contract any marriages or al|liances, and the prohibition of receiving them into the congregation, which in &s;ome ca&s;es was perpetual, almo&s;t always extended to the third,
<PB N="272" REF="287">
to the &s;eventh, or even to the tenth generation. The obligation of preaching to the Gentiles the faith of Mo&s;es, had never been inculcated as a precept of the law, nor were the Jews inclined to impo&s;e it on them&s;elves as a voluntary duty. In the admi&s;&s;ion of new citizens, that un&s;ocial people was actuated by the &s;elfi&s;h vanity of the Greeks, rather than by the generous policy of Rome. The de&s;cendants of Abraham were flat|tered by the opinion, that they alone were the heirs of the covenant, and they were apprehen|&s;ive of dimini&s;hing the value of their inherit|ance, by &s;haring it too ea&s;ily with the &s;trangers of the earth. A larger acquaintance with man|kind, extended their knowledge without correct|ing their prejudices; and whenever the God of I&s;rael acquired any new votaries, he was much more indebted to the incon&s;tant humour of po|lythei&s;m than to the active zeal of his own mi&s;|&s;ionaries <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">All that relates to the Jewi&s;h pro&s;elytes has been very ably treated by Ba&s;nage, Hi&s;t. des Juifs, l. vi. c. 6, 7.</NOTE>.

inculcated in the new as in the ancient &s;y&s;tem: and whatever was now revealed to mankind con|cerning the nature and de&s;igns of the Supreme Being, was fitted to increa&s;e their reverence for that my&s;terious doctrine. The divine authority of Mo&s;es and the prophets was admitted, and even e&s;tabli&s;hed, as the firme&s;t ba&s;is of Chri&s;ti|anity. From the beginning of the world, an uninterrupted &s;eries of predictions had announced and prepared the long expected coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, who, in compliance with the gro&s;s apprehen&s;ions of the Jews, had been more fre|quently repre&s;ented under the character of a King and Conqueror, than under that of a Prophet, a Martyr, and the Son of God. By his expia|tory &s;acrifice, the imperfect &s;acrifices of the tem|ple were at once con&s;ummated and aboli&s;hed. The ceremonial law, which con&s;i&s;ted only of types and figures, was &s;ucceeded by a pure and &s;piritual wor&s;hip, equally adapted to all climates, as well as to every condition of mankind; and to the initiation of blood, was &s;ub&s;tituted a more harmle&s;s initiation of water. The promi&s;e of divine favour, in&s;tead of being partially confined to the po&s;terity of Abraham, was univer&s;ally pro|po&s;ed to the freeman and the &s;lave, to the Greek and to the barbarian, to the Jew and to the Gen|tile. Every privilege that could rai&s;e the pro|&s;elyte from earth to Heaven, that could exalt his devotion, &s;ecure his happine&s;s, or even gratify that &s;ecret pride, which, under the &s;emblance of devotion, in&s;inuates it&s;elf into the human heart,
<PB N="275" REF="290">
was &s;till re&s;erved for the members of the Chri&s;tian church; but at the &s;ame time all mankind was permitted, and even &s;olicited, to accept the glo|rious di&s;tinction, which was not only proffered as a favour, but impo&s;ed as an obligation. It be|came the mo&s;t &s;acred duty of a new convert to diffu&s;e among his friends and relations the ine&s;ti|mable ble&s;&s;ing which he had received, and to warn them again&s;t a refu&s;al that would be &s;e|verely puni&s;hed as a criminal di&s;obedience to the will of a benevolent but all-powerful deity.</P>
<P>The enfranchi&s;ement of the church from the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;tinacy and rea&s;ons of the be|lieving Jews.</NOTE> bonds of the &s;ynagogue, was a work however of &s;ome time and of &s;ome difficulty. The Jewi&s;h converts, who acknowledged Je&s;us in the cha|racter of the Me&s;&s;iah foretold by their ancient oracles, re&s;pected him as a prophetic teacher of virtue and religion; but they ob&s;tinately adhered to the ceremonies of their ance&s;tors, and were de&s;irous of impo&s;ing them on the Gentiles, who continually augmented the number of believers.

It was natural that the primitive tradition of a church which was founded only forty days after the death of Chri&s;t, and was governed almo&s;t as many years under the immediate in&s;pection of his apo&s;tle, &s;hould be received as the &s;tandard of orthodoxy <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">Mo&s;heim de Rebus Chri&s;tianis ante Con&s;tantinum Magnum, p. 153.

The Jewi&s;h converts, or, as they were afterwards called, the Nazarenes, who had laid the foundations of the church, &s;oon found them&s;elves overwhelmed by the increa&s;ing mul|titudes, that from all the various religions of polythei&s;m inli&s;ted under the banner of Chri&s;t:

and the Gentiles, who, with the approbation of their peculiar apo&s;tle, had rejected the intolerable weight of Mo&s;aic ceremonies, at length refu&s;ed to their more &s;crupulous brethren the &s;ame tole|ration which at fir&s;t they had humbly &s;olicited for their own practice. The ruin of the temple, of the city, and of the public religion of the Jews, was &s;everely felt by the Nazarenes; as in their manners, though not in their faith, they main|tained &s;o intimate a connexion with their impious countrymen, who&s;e misfortunes were attributed by the Pagans to the contempt, and more ju&s;tly a&s;cribed by the Chri&s;tians to the wrath, of the Supreme Deity. The Nazarenes retired from the ruins of Jeru&s;alem to the little town of Pella beyond the Jordan, where that ancient church langui&s;hed above &s;ixty years in &s;olitude and ob|&s;curity <NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;ebius, l. iii. c. 5.

With this favourable prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion they &s;ummoned to their aid the &s;cience, or rather the language, of Metaphy&s;ics.

But, in the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;ti|anity, the &s;ituation of mankind was extremely different. The mo&s;t curious, or the mo&s;t cre|dulous, among the Pagans, were often per&s;uad|ed to enter into a &s;ociety, which a&s;&s;erted an actual claim of miraculous powers. The primitive
<PB N="315" REF="330">
Chri&s;tians perpetually trod on my&s;tic ground, and their minds were exerci&s;ed by the habits of believing the mo&s;t extraordinary events. They felt, or they fancied, that on every &s;ide they were ince&s;&s;antly a&s;&s;aulted by daemons, comforted by vi&s;ions, in&s;tructed by prophecy, and &s;urpri|&s;ingly delivered from danger, &s;ickne&s;s, and from death it&s;elf, by the &s;upplications of the church. The real or imaginary prodigies, of which they &s;o frequently conceived them&s;elves to be the ob|jects, the in&s;truments, or the &s;pectators, very happily di&s;po&s;ed them to adopt with the &s;ame ea&s;e, but with far greater ju&s;tice, the authentic wonders of the evangelic hi&s;tory; and thus mira|cles that exceeded not the mea&s;ure of their own experience, in&s;pired them with the mo&s;t lively a&s;&s;urance of my&s;teries which were acknowledged to &s;urpa&s;s the limits of their under&s;tanding. It is this deep impre&s;&s;ion of &s;upernatural truths, which has been &s;o much celebrated under the name of faith; a &s;tate of mind de&s;cribed as the &s;ure&s;t pledge of the divine favour and of future felicity, and recommended as the fir&s;t or per|haps the only merit of a Chri&s;tian.

The fir&s;t apologi&s;ts of Chri&s;tianity who ju&s;tify the innocence of their brethren, and the writers of a later period who celebrate the &s;anctity of their ance&s;tors, di&s;play, in the mo&s;t lively colours, the reformation of manners which was introduced into the world by the preaching of the go&s;pel. As it is my intention to remark only &s;uch human cau&s;es as were permitted to &s;econd the influence of reve|lation, I &s;hall &s;lightly mention two motives which might naturally render the lives of the primitive Chri&s;tians much purer and more au&s;tere than tho&s;e of their Pagan contemporaries, or their degenerate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; repentance for their pa&s;t &s;ins, and the laudable de&s;ire of &s;upporting the reputation of the &s;ociety in which they were engaged.</P>
<P>It is a very ancient reproach, &s;ugge&s;ted by the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Effects of their re|pentance.</NOTE> ignorance or the malice of infidelity, that the Chri&s;tians allured into their party the mo&s;t atro|cious criminals, who, as &s;oon as they were touch|ed by a &s;en&s;e of remor&s;e, were ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to wa&s;h away, in the water of bapti&s;m, the guilt of their pa&s;t conduct, for which the temples of the gods refu&s;ed to grant them any expiation. But this reproach, when it is cleared from mi&s;|repre&s;entation, contributes as much to the ho|nour as it did to the increa&s;e of the church <NOTE N="83" PLACE="foot">The imputations of Cel&s;us and Julian, with the defence of the fathers, are very fairly &s;tated by Spanheim, Commentaire &s;ur les Ce&s;ars de Julian, p. 468.</NOTE>.

&s;aints had been before their bapti&s;m the mo&s;t abandoned &s;inners. Tho&s;e per&s;ons, who in the world had followed, though in an imperfect man|ner, the dictates of benevolence and propriety, derived &s;uch a calm &s;atisfaction from the opinion of their own rectitude, as rendered them much le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;udden emotions of &s;hame, of grief, and of terror, which have given birth to &s;o many wonderful conver&s;ions. After the example of their Divine Ma&s;ter, the mi&s;&s;ionaries of the go&s;pel di&s;dained not the &s;ociety of men, and e&s;pecially of women, oppre&s;&s;ed by the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, and very often by the effects, of their vices. As they emerged from &s;in and &s;uper&s;ti|tion to the glorious hope of immortality, they re&s;olved to devote them&s;elves to a life, not only of virtue, but of penitence. The de&s;ire of per|fection became the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of their &s;oul; and it is well known, that while rea&s;on embraces a cold medicrity, our pa&s;&s;ions hurry us, with rapid violence, over the &s;pace which lies between the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite extremes.</P>
<P>When the new converts had been enrolled in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Care of their repu|tation.</NOTE> the number of the faithful, and were admitted to the &s;acraments of the church, they found them&s;elves re&s;trained from relap&s;ing into their pa&s;t di&s;orders by another con&s;ideration of a le&s;s &s;piritual, but of a very innocent and re&s;pectable nature. Any particular &s;ociety that has departed from the great body of the nation, or the religion to which it belonged, immediately becomes the object of univer&s;al as well as invidious ob&s;erva|tion.

In proportion to the &s;mallne&s;s of its num|bers, the character of the &s;ociety may be affect|ed by the virtue and vices of the per&s;ons who compo&s;e it; and every member is engaged to watch with the mo&s;t vigilant attention over his own behaviour, and over that of his brethren, &s;ince, as he mu&s;t expect to incur a part of the common di&s;grace, he may hope to enjoy a &s;hare of the common reputation. When the Chri&s;tians of Bithynia were brought before the tribunal of the younger Pliny, they a&s;&s;ured the procon&s;ul, that, far from being engaged in any unlawful con&s;piracy, they were bound by a &s;olemn obli|gation to ab&s;tain from the commi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e crimes which di&s;turb the private or public peace of &s;ociety, from theft, robbery, adultery, per|jury, and fraud <NOTE N="84" PLACE="foot">Plin.

<P>There are two very natural propen&s;ities which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Principles of human nature.</NOTE> we may di&s;tingui&s;h in the mo&s;t virtuous and liberal di&s;po&s;itions, the love of plea&s;ure and the love of action. If the former is refined by art and learning, improved by the charms of &s;ocial intercour&s;e, and corrected by a ju&s;t regard to oeconomy, to health, and to reputation, it is productive of the greate&s;t part of the happine&s;s of private life. The love of action is a principle of a much &s;tronger and more doubtful nature. It often leads to anger, to ambition, and to re|venge; but when it is guided by the &s;en&s;e of propriety and benevolence, it becomes the parent of every virtue; and if tho&s;e virtues are accom|panied with equal abilities, a family, a &s;tate, or an empire, may be indebted for their &s;afety and pro&s;perity to the undaunted courage of a &s;ingle man. To the love of plea&s;ure we may therefore a&s;cribe mo&s;t of the agreeable, to the love of action we may attribute mo&s;t of the u&s;eful and re&s;pectable, qualifications. The character in which both the one and the other &s;hould be united and harmoni&s;ed, would &s;eem to con&s;ti|tute the mo&s;t perfect idea of human nature.

Such amu&s;ements, how|ever, were rejected with abhorrence, or admit|ted with the utmo&s;t caution, by the &s;everity of the fathers, who de&s;pi&s;ed all knowledge that was not u&s;eful to &s;alvation, and who con&s;idered all levity of di&s;cour&s;e as a criminal abu&s;e of the gift of &s;peech.

Very different was the rea&s;oning of our devout predece&s;&s;ors; vainly a&s;piring to imitate the per|fection of angels, they di&s;dained, or they affected to di&s;dain, every earthly and corporeal delight <NOTE N="88" PLACE="foot">Lactant.

The &s;afety of that &s;ociety, its honour, its aggrandi&s;ement, were productive, even in the mo&s;t pious minds, of a &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, &s;uch as the fir&s;t of the Romans had felt for the repub|lic, and &s;ometimes, of a &s;imilar indifference, in the u&s;e of whatever means might probably con|duce to &s;o de&s;irable an end. The ambition of rai&s;ing them&s;elves or their friends to the honours and offices of the church, was di&s;gui&s;ed by the laudable intention of devoting to the public benefit, the power and con&s;ideration, which, for that purpo&s;e only, it became their duty to &s;olicit. In the exerci&s;e of their functions, they were fre|quently called upon to detect the errors of here&s;y, or the arts of faction, to oppo&s;e the de&s;igns of perfidious brethren, to &s;tigmatize their charac|ters

with de&s;erved infamy, and to expel them from the bo&s;om of a &s;ociety, who&s;e peace and happine&s;s they had attempted to di&s;turb. The eccle&s;ia&s;tical governors of the Chri&s;tians were taught to unite the wi&s;dom of the &s;erpent with the innocence of the dove; but as the former was refined, &s;o the latter was in&s;en&s;ibly corrupt|ed, by the habits of government. In the church as well as in the world, the per&s;ons who were placed in any public &s;tation rendered them&s;elves con&s;iderable by their eloquence and firmne&s;s, by their knowledge of mankind, and by their dex|terity in bu&s;ine&s;s; and while they concealed from others, and perhaps from them&s;elves, the &s;ecret motives of their conduct, they too frequently relap&s;ed into all the turbulent pa&s;&s;ions of active life, which were tinctured with an additional de|gree of bitterne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy from the infu&s;ion of &s;piritual zeal.</P>

As the in&s;titution of prophets became u&s;ele&s;s, and even pernicious, their powers were with|drawn, and their office aboli&s;hed.

The name of Pre&s;byter was expre&s;&s;ive of their age, or rather of their gravity and wi&s;dom. The title of Bi&s;hop denoted their in&s;pection over the faith and manners of the Chri&s;tians who were committed to their pa&s;toral care.

<P>Such was the mild and equal con&s;titution by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Provincial councils.</NOTE> which the Chri&s;tians were governed more than an hundred years after the death of the apo&s;tles.

As the numbers of the faithful were gra|dually multiplied, they di&s;covered the advantages that might re&s;ult from a clo&s;er union of their intere&s;t and de&s;igns.

It was by the aid of the&s;e cau&s;es, exclu&s;ive zeal, the immedi|ate expectation of another world, the claim of miracles, the practice of rigid virtue, and the con&s;titution of the primitive church, that Chri&s;|tianity &s;pread it&s;elf with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s in the Roman empire. To the fir&s;t of the&s;e the Chri&s;|tians were indebted for their invincible valour, which di&s;dained to capitulate with the enemy whom they were re&s;olved to vanqui&s;h. The three &s;ucceeding cau&s;es &s;upplied their valour with the mo&s;t formidable arms. The la&s;t of the&s;e cau&s;es united their courage, directed their arms, and gave their efforts that irre&s;i&s;tible weight, which even a &s;mall band of well-trained and intrepid volunteers has &s;o often po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over an undi&s;ciplined multitude, ignorant of the &s;ubject, and carele&s;s of the event of the war.

The mini&s;ters of polythei&s;m, both in Rome and in the provinces, were, for the mo&s;t part, men of a noble birth, and of an affluent fortune, who received, as an honourable di&s;tinction, the care of a celebrated temple, or of a public &s;acrifice, exhibited, very frequently at their own expence, the &s;acred games <NOTE N="151" PLACE="foot">The office of A&s;iarch was of this nature, and it is frequently mentioned in Ari&s;tides, the In&s;criptions, &amp;c.

There were likewi&s;e Bithyniarchs, Lyciarchs, &amp;c.</NOTE>, and with cold indifference performed the ancient rites, according to the laws and fa&s;hion of their country. As they were engaged in the ordinary occupations of life, their zeal and devotion were &s;eldom animated by a &s;en&s;e of intere&s;t, or by the habits of an eccle&s;i|a&s;tical character. Confined to their re&s;pective temples and cities, they remained without any connexion of di&s;cipline or government; and whil&s;t they acknowledged the &s;upreme juri&s;dic|tion of the &s;enate, of the college of pontiffs, and

They were abandoned, almo&s;t without controul, to the natural workings of a &s;uper&s;titious fancy. The accidental circum|&s;tances of their life and &s;ituation determined the object as well as the degree of their devotion; and as long as their adoration was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pro&s;tituted to a thou&s;and deities, it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that their hearts could be &s;u&s;ceptible of a very &s;incere or lively pa&s;&s;ion for any of them.</P>
<P>When Chri&s;tianity appeared in the world, even <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;cep|tici&s;m of the Pagan world proved fa|vourable to the new religion,</NOTE> the&s;e faint and imperfect impre&s;&s;ions had lo&s;t much of their original power.

the philo&s;ophic part of mankind affected to treat with re&s;pect and decency the religious in|&s;titutions of their country; but their &s;ecret con|tempt penetrated through the thin and awkward di&s;gui&s;e, and even the people, when they di&s;|covered that their deities were rejected and de|rided by tho&s;e who&s;e rank or under&s;tanding they were accu&s;tomed to reverence, were filled with doubts and apprehen&s;ions concerning the truth of tho&s;e doctrines, to which they had yielded the mo&s;t implicit belief. The decline of ancient prejudice expo&s;ed a very numerous portion of human kind to the danger of a painful and com|fortle&s;s &s;ituation. A &s;tate of &s;ceptici&s;m and &s;u&s;|pen&s;e may amu&s;e a few inqui&s;itive minds. But the practice of &s;uper&s;tition is &s;o congenial to the multitude, that if they are forcibly awakened, they &s;till regret the lo&s;s of their plea&s;ing vi&s;ion. Their love of the marvellous and &s;upernatural, their curio&s;ity with regard to future events, and their &s;trong propen&s;ity to extend their hopes and fears beyond the limits of the vi&s;ible world, were the principal cau&s;es which favoured the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of Polythei&s;m. So urgent on the vulgar is the nece&s;&s;ity of believing, that the fall of any &s;y&s;tem of mythology will mo&s;t probably be &s;uc|ceeded by the introduction of &s;ome other mode of &s;uper&s;tition.

<P>IF we &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the purity of the Chri&s;tian religion, the &s;anctity of its moral precepts, and the innocent as well as au&s;tere lives of the greater <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chri&s;tian|ity per&s;e|cuted by the Ro|man em|perors.</NOTE> number of tho&s;e, who during the fir&s;t ages em|braced the faith of the go&s;pel, we &s;hould natu|rally &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;o benevolent a doctrine would have been received with due reverence, even by the unbelieving world; that the learned and the polite, however they might deride the miracles, would have e&s;teemed the virtues of the new &s;ect; and that the magi&s;trates, in&s;tead of per&s;ecuting, would have protected an order of men who yield|ed the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ive obedience to the laws, though they declined the active cares of war and govern|ment. If on the other hand we recollect the univer&s;al toleration of Polythei&s;m, as it was in|variably maintained by the faith of the people, the incredulity of philo&s;ophers, and the policy of the Roman &s;enate and emperors, we are at a lo&s;s to di&s;cover what new offence the Chri&s;tians had committed, what new provocation could exa&s;perate the mild indifference of antiquity, and what new motives could urge the Roman princes, who beheld without concern a thou&s;and forms of religion &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in peace under their

gentle &s;way, to inflict a &s;evere puni&s;hment on any part of their &s;ubjects, who had cho&s;en for them&s;elves a &s;ingular but an inoffen&s;ive mode of faith and wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The religious policy of the ancient world &s;eems to have a&s;&s;umed a more &s;tern and intolerant cha|racter, to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of Chri&s;tianity. About four&s;core years after the death of Chri&s;t, his innocent di&s;ciples were puni&s;hed with death by the &s;entence of a procon&s;ul of the mo&s;t ami|able and philo&s;ophic character, and according to the laws of an emperor, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the wi&s;|dom and ju&s;tice of his general admini&s;tration. The apologies which were repeatedly addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Trajan are filled with the mo&s;t pathetic complaints, that the Chri&s;tians who obeyed the dictates, and &s;olicited the liberty, of con&s;cience, were alone, among all the &s;ubjects of the Roman empire, excluded from the common benefits of their au&s;picious government. The deaths of a few eminent martyrs have been re|corded with care; and from the time that Chri&s;|tianity was inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme power, the governors of the church have been no le&s;s dili|gently employed in di&s;playing the cruelty, than in imitating the conduct, of their Pagan adver|&s;aries. To &s;eparate (if it be po&s;&s;ible) a few authentic as well as intere&s;ting facts from an un|dige&s;ted ma&s;s of fiction and error, and to relate, in a clear and rational manner, the cau&s;es, the extent, the duration, and the mo&s;t important circum&s;tances of the per&s;ecutions to which the
<PB N="383" REF="398">
fir&s;t Chri&s;tians were expo&s;ed, is the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent Chapter.</P>
<P>The &s;ectaries of a per&s;ecuted religion, de|pre&s;&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Inquiry into their motives.</NOTE> by fear, animated with re&s;entment, and perhaps heated by enthu&s;ia&s;m, are &s;eldom in a proper temper of mind calmly to inve&s;tigate, or candidly to appreciate, the motives of their ene|mies, which often e&s;cape the impartial and di&s;|cerning view even of tho&s;e who are placed at a &s;ecure di&s;tance from the flames of per&s;ecution. A rea&s;on has been a&s;&s;igned for the conduct of the emperors towards the primitive Chri&s;tians, which may appear the more &s;pecious and probable as it is drawn from the acknowledged genius of Poly|thei&s;m. It has already been ob&s;erved, that the religious concord of the world was principally &s;upported by the implicit a&s;&s;ent and reverence which the nations of antiquity expre&s;&s;ed for their re&s;pective traditions and ceremonies. It might therefore be expected, that they would unite with indignation again&s;t any &s;ect or people which &s;hould &s;eparate it&s;elf from the communion of mankind, and claiming the exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of divine knowledge, &s;hould di&s;dain every form of wor&s;hip, except its own, as impious and ido|latrous. The rights of toleration were held by mutual indulgence: they were ju&s;tly for|feited by a refu&s;al of the accu&s;tomed tribute. As the payment of this tribute was inflexibly refu&s;ed by the Jews, and by them alone, the con&s;ideration of the treatment which they expe|rienced

from the Roman magi&s;trates, will &s;erve to explain how far the&s;e &s;peculations are ju&s;tified by facts, and will lead us to di&s;cover the true cau&s;es of the per&s;ecution of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Without repeating what has been already men|tioned, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellious &s;pirit of the Jews.</NOTE> of the reverence of the Roman princes and governors for the temple of Jeru&s;alem, we &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the de&s;truction of the temple and city was accompanied and followed by every circum&s;tance that could exa&s;perate the minds of the conquerors, and authorize religious per&s;ecution by the mo&s;t &s;pecious arguments of political ju&s;tice and the public &s;afety. From the reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius, the Jews di&s;covered a fierce impatience of the domi|nion of Rome, which repeatedly broke out in the mo&s;t furious ma&s;&s;acres and in&s;urrections. Humanity is &s;hocked at the recital of the horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of Egypt, of Cyprus, and of Cyrene, where they dwelt in treacherous friend&s;hip with the un&s;u&s;|pecting natives <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">In Cyrene they ma&s;&s;acred 220,000 Greeks; in Cyprus, 240,000; in Egypt, a very great multitude.

The victorious Jews devoured the fle&s;h, licked up the blood, and twi&s;ted the entrails like a girdle round their bodies.

The enthu&s;ia&s;m of the Jews was &s;upported by the opinion, that it was unlawful for them to pay taxes to an idolatrous ma&s;ter; and by the flat|tering promi&s;e which they derived from their ancient oracles, that a conquering Me&s;&s;iah would &s;oon ari&s;e, de&s;tined to break their fetters, and to inve&s;t the favourites of heaven with the empire of the earth. It was by announcing him&s;elf as their long-expected deliverer, and by calling on all the de&s;cendants of Abraham to a&s;&s;ert the hope of I&s;rael, that the famous Barchochebas collected a formidable army, with which he re&s;i&s;ted dur|ing two years the power of the emperor Ha|drian <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">For the &s;ect of the Zealots, &s;ee Ba&s;nage, Hi&s;toire des Jui&s;s, l. i. c. 17. for the characters of the Me&s;&s;iah, according to the Rabbis, l. v. c. 11, 12, 13. for the actions of Barchochebas, l. vii. c. 12.</NOTE>.</P>

The numerous remains of that people, though they were &s;till excluded from the precincts of Jeru&s;alem, were permitted to form and to main|tain con&s;iderable e&s;tabli&s;hments both in Italy and in the provinces, to acquire the freedom of Rome, to enjoy municipal honours, and to obtain at the &s;ame time an exemption from the burden&s;ome and expen&s;ive offices of &s;ociety. The modera|tion or the contempt of the Romans gave a legal &s;anction to the form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical police which was in&s;tituted by the vanqui&s;hed &s;ect.

<P>Since the Jews, who rejected with abhorrence <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Jews were a peo|ple which followed, the Chri&s;|tians a &s;ect which de&s;erted, the religi|on of their fathers.</NOTE> the deities adored by their &s;overeign and by their fellow-&s;ubjects, enjoyed however the free exer|ci&s;e of their un&s;ocial religion; there mu&s;t have exi&s;ted &s;ome other cau&s;e, which expo&s;ed the di&s;|ciples of Chri&s;t to tho&s;e &s;everities from which the po&s;terity of Abraham was exempt. The differ|ence between them is &s;imple and obvious; but, according to the &s;entiments of antiquity, it was of the highe&s;t importance. The Jews were a <HI>nation;</HI> the Chri&s;tians were a <HI>&s;ect:</HI> and if it was natural for every community to re&s;pect the &s;acred in&s;titutions of their neighbours, it was incum|bent on them to per&s;evere in tho&s;e of their an|ce&s;tors. The voice of oracles, the precepts of philo&s;ophers, and the authority of the laws, una|nimou&s;ly enforced this national obligation. By their lofty claim of &s;uperior &s;anctity, the Jews
<PB N="388" REF="403">
might provoke the Polythei&s;ts to con&s;ider them as an odious and impure race. By di&s;daining the intercour&s;e of other nations they might de|&s;erve their contempt. The laws of Mo&s;es might be for the mo&s;t part frivolous or ab&s;urd; yet &s;ince they had been received during many ages by a large &s;ociety, his followers were ju&s;tified by the example of mankind; and it was univer|&s;ally acknowledged, that they had a right to practi&s;e what it would have been criminal in them to neglect. But this principle which pro|tected the Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue, afforded not any favour or &s;ecurity to the primitive church. By embracing the faith of the Go&s;pel, the Chri&s;tians incurred the &s;uppo&s;ed guilt of an unnatural and unpardonable offence. They di&s;&s;olved the &s;acred ties of cu&s;tom and education, violated the religi|ous in&s;titutions of their country, and pre&s;ump|tuou&s;ly de&s;pi&s;ed whatever their fathers had be|lieved as true, or had reverenced as &s;acred. Nor was this apo&s;tacy (if we may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion) merely of a partial or local kind; &s;ince the pious de&s;erter who withdrew him&s;elf from the temples of Egypt or Syria, would equally di&s;dain to &s;eek an a&s;ylum in tho&s;e of Athens or Carthage. Every Chri&s;tian rejected with contempt the &s;uper&s;titions of his family, his city, and his province. The whole body of Chri&s;tians unanimou&s;ly refu&s;ed to hold any communion with the gods of Rome, of the empire, and of mankind. It was in vain that the oppre&s;&s;ed believer a&s;&s;erted the inalienable rights of con&s;cience and private judgment. Though his &s;ituation might excite the pity, his

arguments could never reach the under&s;tanding, either of the philo&s;ophic or of the believing part of the Pagan world. To their apprehen&s;ions, it was no le&s;s a matter of &s;urpri&s;e, that any indi|viduals &s;hould entertain &s;cruples again&s;t comply|ing with the e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of wor&s;hip, than if they had conceived a &s;udden abhorrence to the manners, the dre&s;s, or the language of their na|tive country <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">From the arguments of Cel&s;us, as they are repre&s;ented and refuted by Origen (l. v. p. 247-259.), we may clearly di&s;cover the di&s;tinction that was made between the Jewi&s;h <HI>people</HI> and the Chri&s;|tian <HI>&s;ect.</HI> See in the Dialogue of Minucius Foelix (c. 5, 6.) a fair and not inelegant de&s;cription of the popular &s;entiments, with regard to the de&s;ertion of the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip.</NOTE>.</P>

The pure and &s;ublime idea which they entertained of the Su|preme Being e&s;caped the gro&s;s conception of the Pagan multitude, who were at a lo&s;s to di&s;cover

For a while, this dire &s;uper&s;tition was checked; but it again bur&s;t forth; and not only &s;pread it&s;elf over Judaea, the fir&s;t &s;eat of this mi&s;|chievous &s;ect, but was even introduced into Rome, the common a&s;ylum which receives and protects, whatever is impure, whatever is atrocious. The confe&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e who were &s;eized, di&s;covered a great multitude of their accomplices, and they were all convicted, not &s;o much for the crime of &s;etting fire to the city, as for their hatred of human kind <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot"><HI>Odio humani generis convicti.</HI> The&s;e words may either &s;ignify the hatred of mankind towards the Chri&s;tians, or the hatred of the Chri&s;tians towards mankind.

Within fifteen days the palace of Nicomedia, and even the bedchamber of Diocletian, were twice in flames; and though both times they were extingui&s;hed without any material damage, the &s;ingular repetition of the fire was ju&s;tly con|&s;idered as an evident proof that it had not been the effect of chance or negligence.

Jealou&s;y and re&s;entment pre|vailed in every brea&s;t, but e&s;pecially in that of Diocletian. A great number of per&s;ons, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed either by the offices which they had filled, or by the favour which they had enjoyed, were thrown into pri&s;on.

This delay may perhaps be im|puted to the cautious temper of Diocletian, who had yielded a reluctant con&s;ent to the mea&s;ures of per&s;ecution, and who was de&s;irous of trying the experiment under his more immediate eye, before he gave way to the di&s;orders and di&s;con|tent which it mu&s;t inevitably occa&s;ion in the di&s;tant provinces.

<P>The provinces of Italy and Africa experienced <NOTE PLACE="marg">in Italy and Africa, under Maximian and Seve|rus;</NOTE> a &s;hort but violent per&s;ecution. The rigorous edicts of Diocletian were &s;trictly and cheerfully executed by his a&s;&s;ociate Maximian, who had long hated the Chri&s;tians, and who delighted in acts of blood and violence. In the autumn of the fir&s;t year of the per&s;ecution, the two empe|rors met at Rome to celebrate their triumph; &s;everal oppre&s;&s;ive laws appear to have i&s;&s;ued from their &s;ecret con&s;ultations, and the diligence of the magi&s;trates was animated by the pre&s;ence of their &s;overeigns. After Diocletian had dive&s;ted him&s;elf of the purple, Italy and Africa were admini&s;tered under the name of Severus, and were expo&s;ed, without defence, to the implacable re&s;entment of his ma&s;ter Galerius. Among the martyrs of Rome, Adauctus de&s;erves the notice of po&s;terity. He was of a noble family in Italy, and had rai&s;ed him&s;elf, through the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive honours of the palace, to the important office of trea&s;urer of the private deme&s;nes. Adauctus is the more remarkable for being the only per&s;on of rank and di&s;tinction who appears to have &s;uf|fered death, during the whole cour&s;e of this general per&s;ecution <NOTE N="167" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;ebius, l. viii. c. 11.

<P>The &s;anguinary temper of Galerius, the fir&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">in Illyri|cum and the Ea&s;t, under Ga|lerius and Maximi|an.</NOTE> and principal author of the per&s;ecution, was formidable to tho&s;e Chri&s;tians, whom their mi&s;|fortunes had placed within the limits of his do|minions; and it may fairly be pre&s;umed, that many per&s;ons of a middle rank, who were not confined by the chains either of wealth or of poverty, very frequently de&s;erted their native country, and &s;ought a refuge in the milder cli|mate of the We&s;t. As long as he commanded only the armies and provinces of Illyricum, he could with difficulty either find or make a con|&s;iderable number of martyrs, in a warlike coun|try, which had entertained the mi&s;&s;ionaries of the go&s;pel with more coldne&s;s and reluctance than any other part of the empire <NOTE N="172" PLACE="foot">During the four fir&s;t centuries, there exi&s;t few traces of either bi&s;hops or bi&s;hoprics in the we&s;tern Illyricum.

De&s;irous of repairing the mi&s;chief that he had occa&s;ioned, he publi&s;hed in his own name, and in tho&s;e of Licinius and Con&s;tantine, a general edict, which, after a pompous recital of the Im|perial titles, proceeded in the following manner:</P>

the ancient laws and public di&s;cipline of the Romans. We were particularly de&s;irous of reclaiming, into the way of rea&s;on and nature, the deluded Chri&s;tians, who had renounced the religion and ceremonies in&s;tituted by their fathers; and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly de&s;pi&s;ing the practice of antiquity, had invented extravagant laws and opinions according to the dictates of their fancy, and had collected a various &s;ociety from the different provinces of our empire.

<P>When Galerius &s;ub&s;cribed this edict of tolera|tion, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace of the church.</NOTE> he was well a&s;&s;ured that Licinius would readily comply with the inclinations of his friend and benefactor, and that any mea&s;ures in favour of the Chri&s;tians, would obtain the approbation of Con&s;tantine. But the emperor would not venture to in&s;ert in the preamble the name of Maximin, who&s;e con&s;ent was of the greate&s;t im|portance, and who &s;ucceeded a few days after|wards to the provinces of A&s;ia. In the fir&s;t &s;ix months, however, of his new reign, Maximin affected to adopt the prudent coun&s;els of his predece&s;&s;or; and though he never conde&s;cended to &s;ecure the tranquillity of the church by a public edict, Sabinus, his Praetorian praefect, addre&s;&s;ed a circular letter to all the governors and magi&s;trates of the provinces, expatiating on the Imperial clemency, acknowledging the in|vincible ob&s;tinacy of the Chri&s;tians, and directing the officers of ju&s;tice to cea&s;e their ineffectual pro&s;ecutions, and to connive at the &s;ecret a&s;&s;em|blies of tho&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;ts. In con&s;equence of the&s;e orders, great numbers of Chri&s;tians were relea&s;ed from pri&s;on, or delivered from the mines.

<P>But this treacherous calm was of &s;hort dura|tion, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Maximin prepares to renew the per&s;ecuti|on.</NOTE> nor could the Chri&s;tians of the Ea&s;t place any confidence in the character of their &s;overeign. Cruelty and &s;uper&s;tition were the ruling pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul of Maximin. The former &s;ugge&s;ted the means, the latter pointed out the objects, of per&s;ecution. The emperor was devoted to the wor&s;hip of the gods, to the &s;tudy of magic, and to the belief of oracles. The prophets or phi|lo&s;ophers, whom he revered as the favourites of heaven, were frequently rai&s;ed to the govern|ment of provinces, and admitted into his mo&s;t &s;ecret councils. They ea&s;ily convinced him, that the Chri&s;tians had been indebted for their vic|tories to their regular di&s;cipline, and that the weakne&s;s of polythei&s;m had principally flowed from a want of union and &s;ubordination among the mini&s;ters of religion. A &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment was therefore in&s;tituted, which was evi|dently copied from the policy of the church. In all the great cities of the empire, the temples were repaired and beautified by the order of Max|imin; and the officiating prie&s;ts of the various deities were &s;ubjected to the authority of a &s;upe|rior pontiff, de&s;tined to oppo&s;e the bi&s;hop, and to promote the cau&s;e of pagani&s;m. The&s;e pontiffs acknowledged, in their turn, the &s;upreme juri&s;diction of the metropolitans or high-prie&s;ts of the province, who acted as the immediate
<PB N="488" REF="503">
vicegerents of the emperor him&s;elf. A white robe was the en&s;ign of their dignity; and the&s;e new prelates were carefully &s;elected from the mo&s;t noble and opulent families. By the influ|ence of the magi&s;trates, and of the &s;acerdotal order, a great number of dutiful addre&s;&s;es were obtained, particularly from the cities of Nico|media, Antioch, and Tyre, which artfully repre|&s;ented the well-known intentions of the court as the general &s;en&s;e of the people; &s;olicited the emperor to con&s;ult the laws of ju&s;tice rather than the dictates of his clemency; expre&s;&s;ed their ab|horrence of the Chri&s;tians, and humbly prayed that tho&s;e impious &s;ectaries might at lea&s;t be excluded from the limits of their re&s;pective ter|ritories. The an&s;wer of Maximin to the addre&s;s which he obtained from the citizens of Tyre is &s;till extant. He prai&s;es their zeal and devotion in terms of the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction, de&s;cants on the ob&s;tinate impiety of the Chri&s;tians, and be|trays, by the readine&s;s with which he con&s;ents to their bani&s;hment, that he con&s;idered him&s;elf as receiving, rather than as conferring, an obliga|tion. The prie&s;ts as well as the magi&s;trates were empowered to enforce the execution of his edicts, which were engraved on tables of bra&s;s; and though it was recommended to them to avoid the effu&s;ion of blood, the mo&s;t cruel and igno|minious puni&s;hments were inflicted on the refrac|tory Chri&s;tians <NOTE N="176" PLACE="foot">See Eu&s;ebius, l. viii. c. 14. l. ix. c. 2&mdash;8.

The&s;e melan|choly &s;cenes might be enlivened by a crowd of vi&s;ions and miracles de&s;tined either to delay the death, to celebrate the triumph, or to di&s;cover the relics, of tho&s;e canonized &s;aints who &s;uffered for the name of Chri&s;t.

The more ancient writers content them&s;elves with pouring out a liberal effu&s;ion of loo&s;e and tragical invectives, without conder&s;cending to a&s;certain the preci&s;e number of tho&s;e per&s;ons who were permitted to

&s;eal with their blood their belief of the go&s;pel. From the hi&s;tory of Eu&s;ebius, it may however be collected, that only nine bi&s;hops were puni&s;hed with death; and we are a&s;&s;ured, by his particular enumeration of the martyrs of Pale&s;tine, that no more than ninety-two Chri&s;tians were entitled to that honourable appellation <NOTE N="182" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;ebius de Martyr. Pale&s;tin. c. 13. He clo&s;es his narration, by a&s;&s;uring us, that the&s;e were the martyrdoms inflicted in Pale&s;|tine, during the <HI>whole</HI> cour&s;e of the per&s;ecution. The vth chapter of his viiith book, which relates to the province of Thebais in Egypt, may &s;eem to contradict our moderate computation; but it will only lead us to admire the artful management of the hi&s;torian. Chu&s;ing for the &s;cene of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite cruelty, the mo&s;t remote and &s;e|que&s;tered country of the Roman empire, he relates, that in Thebais, from ten to one hundred per&s;ons had frequently &s;uffered martyrdom in the &s;ame day. But when he proceeds to mention his own jour|ney into Egypt, his language in&s;en&s;ibly becomes more cautious and moderate. In&s;tead of a large, but definite number, he &s;peaks of many Chri&s;tians (<GAP DESC="foreign">); and mo&s;t artfully &s;elects two ambiguous words (<GAP DESC="foreign">, and <GAP DESC="foreign">), which may &s;ignify either what he had &s;een, or what he had heard; either the expectation, or the execution, of the puni&s;hment. Having thus provided a &s;ecure eva&s;ion, he com|mits the equivocal pa&s;&s;age to his readers and tran&s;lators; ju&s;tly con|ceiving that their piety would induce them to prefer the mo&s;t favour|able &s;en&s;e. There was perhaps &s;ome malice in the remark of Theo|dorus Metochita, that all who, like Eu&s;ebius, had been conver&s;ant with the Egyptians, delighted in an ob&s;cure and intricate &s;tyle. (See Vale&s;ius ad loc.)</NOTE>. As we are un|acquainted with the degree of epi&s;copal zeal and courage which prevailed at that time, it is not in our power to draw any u&s;eful inferences from the former of the&s;e facts: but the latter may &s;erve to ju&s;tify a very important and probable conclu&s;ion. According to the di&s;tribution of Roman provinces, Pale&s;tine may be con&s;idered as the &s;ixteenth part of the Ea&s;tern empire <NOTE N="183" PLACE="foot">When Pale&s;tine was divided into three, the praefecture of the Ea&s;t contained forty-eight provinces. As the ancient di&s;tinctions ofnations were long &s;ince aboli&s;hed, the Romans di&s;tributed the pro|vinces, according to a general proportion of their extent and opu|lence.</NOTE>;

and &s;ince there were &s;ome governors, who from a real or affected clemency had pre&s;erved their hands un&s;tained with the blood of the faithful <NOTE N="184" PLACE="foot">Ut gloriari po&s;&s;int nullum &s;e innocentium peremi&s;&s;e, nam et ip&s;e audivi aliquos gloriantes, quia admini&s;tratio &s;ua, in h&acirc;c parte, fuerit incruenta. Lactant. In&s;titut. Divin. v. 11.</NOTE>, it is rea&s;onable to believe, that the country which had given birth to Chri&s;tianity produced at lea&s;t the &s;ixteenth part of the martyrs who &s;uffered death within the dominions of Galerius and Max|imin; the whole might con&s;equently amount to about fifteen hundred, a number which, if it is equally divided between the ten years of the per|&s;ecution, will allow an annual con&s;umption of one hundred and fifty martyrs. Allotting the &s;ame proportion to the provinces of Italy, Africa, and perhaps Spain, where, at the end of two or three years, the rigour of the penal laws was either &s;u&s;pended or aboli&s;hed, the multitude of Chri&s;tians in the Roman empire, on whom a ca|pital puni&s;hment was inflicted by a judicial &s;en|tence, will be reduced to &s;omewhat le&s;s than two thou&s;and per&s;ons. Since it cannot be doubted that the Chri&s;tians were more numerous, and their enemies more exa&s;perated, in the time of Diocletian than they had ever been in any for|mer per&s;ecution, this probable and moderate computation may teach us to e&s;timate the num|ber of primitive &s;aints and martyrs who &s;acrificed their lives for the important purpo&s;e of introdu|cing Chri&s;tianity into the world.</P>

We &s;hall conclude this chapter by a melancholy truth, which obtrudes it&s;elf on the reluctant mind; that even admitting, without he&s;itation <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclu&s;i|on.</NOTE> or enquiry, all that hi&s;tory has recorded, or de|votion has feigned, on the &s;ubject of martyrdoms, it mu&s;t &s;till be acknowledged, that the Chri&s;tians, in the cour&s;e of their inte&s;tine di&s;&s;entions, have inflicted far greater &s;everities on each other, than they had experienced from the zeal of infidels. During the ages of ignorance which followed the &s;ubver&s;ion of the Roman empire in the We&s;t, the bi&s;hops of the Imperial city extended their dominion over the laity as well as clergy of the Latin church. The fabric of &s;uper&s;tition which they had erected, and which might long have defied the feeble efforts of rea&s;on, was at length a&s;&s;aulted by a crowd of daring fanatics, who, from the twelfth to the &s;ixteenth century, a&s;&s;umed the popular character of reformers. The church of Rome defended by violence the empire which &s;he had acquired by fraud; a &s;y&s;tem of peace and benevolence was &s;oon di&s;graced by pro&s;crip|tions, wars, ma&s;&s;acres, and the in&s;titution of the holy office. And as the reformers were animated by the love of civil, as well as of religious freedom, the Catholic princes connected their own intere&s;t with that of the clergy, and enforced by fire and the &s;word the terrors of &s;piritual cen&s;ures. In the Netherlands alone, more than one hundred thou&s;and of the &s;ubjects of Charles the Fifth are &s;aid to have &s;uffered by the hand of the execu|tioner; and this extraordinary number is atte&s;ted

If we are obliged to &s;ubmit our belief to the authority of Grotius, it mu&s;t be allowed, that the number of Prote&s;tants, who were exe|cuted in a &s;ingle province and a &s;ingle reign, far exceeded that of the primitive martyrs in the &s;pace of three centuries, and of the Roman em|pire.
