<P>MR. Faulkner of Dublin having, in the News-Paper which bears his name, of November 3. 1753. publi&s;hed a &s;ort of Defence of his own conduct in the tran&s;action that pa&s;&s;ed between him and the Editor of the HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON; in which he in&s;inuates, that what was done by him and &s;ome of his Brethren in trade, in Dublin, was in pur&s;uance of a cu&s;tom long e&s;tabli&s;hed among the Dublin Book|&s;ellers: And having al&s;o written Letters to &s;everal per&s;ons of cha|racter in London, endeavouring to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, without having that &s;trict regard to veracity in them, which particularly becomes a man of bu&s;ine&s;s; yet intrepidly de&s;iring that the&s;e Letters might be &s;hewn to Mr. Richard&s;on: And, la&s;tly, having joined with his Brethren to &s;hut the Dublin Pre&s;&s;es again&s;t his ju&s;t complaints of the treatment he has met with from &s;ome of them; Mr. Richard|&s;on thinks he &s;hall be excu&s;ed for taking this opportunity to lay before the Publick an account of the whole tran&s;action; and the rather, as the Invaders of his property have done their utmo&s;t to make a NATIONAL CAUSE of the mea&s;ure they compelled him to take; and as he pre&s;umes to think, that the CAUSE OF LITE|RATURE in general is affected by their u&s;age of him.</P>
<P>He will begin with tran&s;cribing Mr. Faulkner's Defence of him&s;elf.</P>
<Q><P><LABEL>Mr. Faulkner's Defence. Dublin, <DATE>Nov. 3. 1753.</DATE></LABEL></P><P>George Faulkner, of Dublin, Printer and Book&s;eller, having contracted &s;ome time ago with Mr. Samuel Richard&s;on, of Lon|don, for a Work, intitled, The Hi&s;tory of Sir Charles Grandi|&s;on, which Mr. Richard&s;on was to &s;end to Ireland before pub|lication in London: Accord|ingly Mr. Richard&s;on &s;ent over four Sheets of the fir&s;t Volume, which Mr. Faulkner received the third day of la&s;t Augu&s;t, 1753, and po&s;ted up a Title that day, which is a common <PB N="6" REF="4"> to give notice, that they have put a Work, or Works, to the Pre&s;s, with de&s;ign to publi&s;h with all convenient &s;peed; and thought that no other per&s;on in the kingdom had any part of that Hi&s;tory; but, to his great &s;urprize, there were three other Titles po&s;ted up immedi|ately after his, by three differ|ent Book&s;ellers, who &s;hewed twelve &s;heets of this Work in the &s;ame Edition, and almo&s;t the fir&s;t Volume complete, in a larger letter and paper.</P>



</Q>
<P><PB N="5" REF="3" MS="y"><LABEL>Genuine Hi&s;tory of the Tran&s;|action.</LABEL></P>
<P>Mr. Faulkner knew, though he does not here &s;ay he did, how the three Book&s;ellers came at the Sheets. In his Letter, dated Dublin, Aug. 4. he &s;ent Mr. Ri|chard&s;on the fir&s;t news of the in|va&s;ion of his property. <Q REND="inline">"I am very &s;orry," &s;ays he, "for the ill-treatment, and the di&s;ap|pointment that you and I have met with in the Hi&s;tory of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; four &s;heets of which Work I received by the la&s;t Po&s;t: But, to my great &s;urprize, I find FOUR other


<PB N="6" REF="4">more of the &s;ame Work, in Octavo and Duodecimo; which they have &s;hewn me, and left with me to compare."</Q> </P>
<P>He then gives proof of the in|iquity, as it came out on his ex|amination of the &s;heets.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The&s;e circum&s;tances," pro|ceeds he, "will, I hope, convince you of the truth of what I have a&s;&s;erted" [He had be|fore given cautions to Mr. R. again&s;t the attempts of his Bre|thren the Dublin Book&s;ellers upon the morality of his men], "and of the villainy and fraud of your Journeymen, who have <HI>robbed you,</HI> and <HI>injured me:</HI> For which rea&s;ons, it will be trouble&s;ome and unnece&s;&s;ary for you to &s;end me any more of this Work, as the per&s;ons who have printed the in|clo&s;ed Titles, with ANOTHER Book&s;eller, claim the &s;ole property of this Work: And if I can prevail upon them to give me a &s;hare, it will be only a fifth part."</Q> Might not a man, with whom he was in treaty, and who had given him, as will be &s;een, an <HI>unde&s;erved</HI> preference, have expected advice and offers of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from him on this ba&s;e attempt (the rather, as he &s;eemed very &s;en&s;ible, for his <HI>own</HI> &s;ake, of the injury done Mr. R.) in&s;tead of endeavouring to <HI>prevail</HI> on &s;uch a Confederacy to admit him into a &s;hare with them in a Copy &s;o vilely obtained? And this, without con&s;ulting Mr. R. or propo&s;ing to him to acquit him of his engage|ments to him! At that time, the corruptors of the hone&s;ty of Mr. R's &s;ervants had made no progre&s;s in the Work: And Mr. F. knew, that Mr. R. was in the way of &s;ending him &s;heets by every Po&s;t; and (intending to publi&s;h but two Volumes at a time) that Mr. F. would have the &s;heets early enough to an&s;wer the intentions and the engagements of both.</P>
<P><HI>Three</HI> of the four per&s;ons are named in the Title-pages he in|cluded in his Letter; WILSON, EXSHAW, SAUNDERS: But Mr. Faulkner, for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf, has not, to this hour, named the <HI>Fourth;</HI> who is believed to be a Book&s;eller in Dublin, who &s;erved his apprentice&s;hip with him.</P>
<P>Mr. Richard&s;on, in his An&s;wer to this Letter, dated Aug. 10. gave Mr. Faulkner great opportunities to recollect him&s;elf. After complaining of this cruel treatment, he informs him, <Q REND="inline">'That he had put a &s;top to the printing of the Work; and that he would appeal to the World upon it.'</Q> He de&s;ires, <Q REND="inline">'that he would not mention the corrections in the &s;heets he had &s;ent him over, tho' matter of nicety rather than nece&s;&s;ity; &s;uppo&s;ing it po&s;&s;ible' [as
<PB N="7" REF="5">
it has proved] 'that men, who could act as the&s;e Confederates had acted, would be capable of adverti&s;ing the pirated edition as preferable to the genuine.'</Q> In order to put Mr. Faulkner upon offering him his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;uch way as he thought be&s;t, though forbidden by him to &s;end him any more &s;heets, he de&s;ired to know if he was to conclude that all dealings between them were ab&s;olutely at an end. He the rather put this to Mr. Faulkner, as he, before he made his court to the Confederates, had be&s;poke twenty-five &s;ets in Octavo; of which Mr. R. never after heard one word, though they did not propo&s;e to propagate their piracy in that &s;ize. No doubt, he thought, that 25 &s;ets in Octavo, &s;old by him for Mr. R. might be a deduction of as many from the &s;ale of his and his new partners Edition in Duodecimo.&mdash;So wholly was he, in an in&s;tant, detached from Mr. R. and attached to them, and his and their common intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkner, in his Reply, dated the 14th and 16th of Augu&s;t, acquaints Mr. R. that the <HI>three</HI> Book&s;ellers had got the Fir&s;t and Se|cond Volumes complete in both Editions; Wil&s;on the Octavo, Ex&s;haw and Saunders the Other; and that each of them had laid him&s;elf out to get the Work, as &s;oon as they &s;aw, by the Adver|ti&s;ements in the London Papers, that it would be publi&s;hed the following winter. An Adverti&s;ement put into tho&s;e Pa|pers, that the World might not take another Book of a Sir Charles Goodville, in a Series of Letters, for that expected from Mr. R.</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkner declares, in this Letter, that the liberty taken by Wil&s;on of adverti&s;ing his intended Edition [London: Printed for S. Richard&s;on: Dublin: Reprinted <HI>for</HI> Peter Wil&s;on, in Dame|&s;treet.] to be printed for Mr. Richard&s;on, was a licence <HI>never be|fore taken</HI> in Dublin, unle&s;s the Work were printed for the Author's benefit. He advi&s;es Mr. Richard&s;on again&s;t &s;ending over any of his Books to Ireland; and to write to the Invaders, the Corrup|tors, to induce them to pay him their &s;hares of the Seventy Gui|neas, &s;tipulated by him to be paid, had he had the whole to him|&s;elf; declaring his willingne&s;s to pay his quota for the &s;hare they would allow him to have. <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry to tell you," proceeds he, in this Letter, "that when <HI>the&s;e People</HI> produced their &s;heets, and <HI>obliged</HI> me" [Mean man!] to &s;hew mine, that I was <HI>com|pelled</HI> to give them up, in order to obtain a &s;hare with them."</Q> His very words!&mdash;</P>
<P>This &s;tep, be&s;ides the advantage they afterwards (on publi&s;hing their pirated Edition), took of it, as Mr. R. had fore&s;een, to recom|mend that Edition, &s;ecured Mr. Faulkner of their &s;ide. By it he ab|&s;olutely gave up Mr. Richard&s;on; and, no doubt, it &s;pirited them to proceed, as they then had rea&s;on to look upon him as their own, and had no diver&s;ion to apprehend from him in Mr. R's favour.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Your &s;ending me more &s;heets," continued he, "will be u&s;e|le&s;s&mdash;I &s;hould be &s;orry your dealings and mine &s;hould be at an
<PB N="8" REF="6">
end; as I have the highe&s;t honour and regard for you, for your many virtues and integrity."</Q></P>
<P>But the&s;e were only words. He offered not to Mr. Richard|&s;on any &s;ervice, any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He knew that he and his Confede|rates &s;hould be able to &s;ecure in their intere&s;t the Dublin Pre&s;&s;es. He had di&s;couraged the &s;ending over any of the genuine Edition; and thought it right to conclude with repeating his advice, that Mr. Richard&s;on would meanly court the Corruptors, as he had done; intimating his de&s;ire to have a copy of what he thought fit to write to them; le&s;t his new Confederates &s;hould not have con|fidence enough in him, to &s;hew him what he &s;uppo&s;ed Mr. R. would write.</P>
<P>In Mr. Richard&s;on's An&s;wer to this Letter, dated Aug. 24. he tells Mr. Faulkner, <Q REND="inline">'That he never could con&s;ent to propo&s;e terms to men who had bribed his &s;ervants to rob him; and who were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tolen goods: And cautions him to confider how far his own honour was concerned in the engage|ments he had entered into with them.'</Q></P>
<P>But let us &s;ee what he further &s;ays in his printed Defence.</P>
<Q>Upon which, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> as they produced &s;o much of the Copy, they (viz. <HI>Mr. Faulkner and the Confederates</HI>) agreed, according to an e&s;tabli&s;hed, invariable, and con&s;tant cu&s;tom among the Book&s;ellers of Dublin, that whoever gets any Books or Pamphlets, or any part of them, by the &s;ame Po&s;t, &s;hall or may join together, if they think proper.&mdash;</Q>
<P>Will Mr. Faulkner &s;ay, that it is an <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed, invariable, con|&s;tant</HI> cu&s;tom among the Book&s;el|lers of Dublin, to renounce their agreements with men they had contracted with, on their being notoriou&s;ly robbed, and to join with the Corruptors, to &s;upplicate a &s;hare with them in the plunder? How wickedly does he &s;lubber over this part of his conduct, to the ju&s;tification, as may be &s;aid, of that of his new Confederates!&mdash;Can &s;uch a man as this be too &s;everely (if ju&s;tly) dealt with?&mdash;Surely no!. He cannot expect that we &s;hould longer let &s;leep an affair, that, till now, in tenderne&s;s to him, he has never been re|minded of, and mu&s;t believe had been entirely forgotten. But, fir&s;t, we will tran&s;cribe a paragraph, which will &s;hew the &s;en&s;e he affected to have then of the fraudulent means by which the Cor|ruptors obtained the power they had of injuring Mr. R.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t have more rogues in your hou&s;e than one," &s;ays he; "as your two Editions have been &s;ent to different people. If I could find out," proceeds he, "any of <HI>my</HI> Journeymen that would &s;erve <HI>me</HI> in the &s;ame <HI>villainous manner,</HI> I would immediately di&s;|charge them in the mo&s;t infamous manner, and publi&s;h their <HI>crimes</HI> in the mo&s;t public manner in all the Papers; which, I am told by a very old French Journeyman Printer, is a con&s;tant
<PB N="9" REF="7">
practice in Germany, France, Holland, and Switzerland; and that care is taken to &s;end tho&s;e adverti&s;ements to all the Print|ing-offices in tho&s;e countries, to <HI>prevent Ma&s;ters from being im|po&s;ed on:</HI> And I am further told, that Journeymen and Appren|tices will not conver&s;e, or &s;uffer <HI>the&s;e nefarious Villains</HI> to be in|terred in the earth; but kick their dead carca&s;es from place to place, as they would dead <HI>cats</HI> or <HI>dogs, rats</HI> or <HI>mice.</HI> Perhaps," adds he, "I have been too warm in my re&s;entment again&s;t <HI>&s;uch bad men:</HI> But, as I have been much injured by them, I hope you will excu&s;e any ra&s;h words in this Letter, when I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I am, for your many virtues, genius, genero&s;ity, and abi|lities, your mo&s;t obedient<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">When this flaming paragraph was, <HI>in terrorem,</HI> read, in Mr. Ri|chard&s;on's Printing-office, to his Workmen, Killingbeck, a &s;u&s;pected man, who afterwards gave too much cau&s;e for the &s;u&s;picion, and who had been a journeyman for &s;everal years to Mr. Faulkner, in Dublin, declared, that, notwith&s;tanding this <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> vehemence of Mr. Faulk|ner, he had hardly, in all the time he was with him, compo&s;ed from any other copy but fir&s;t proofs, revi&s;es, &amp;c. clande&s;tinely obtained from England.</NOTE>, &amp;c."</Q></P>
<P>In this very Letter it was, that Mr. Faulkner declared his in|tentions to endeavour to <HI>prevail</HI> upon the Corruptors of <HI>tho&s;e nefa|rious villains,</HI> as he ju&s;tly calls them, to allow him a fourth or a fifth &s;hare in their <HI>&s;nacks.</HI> It is Machiavellian policy to love the trea&s;on and hate the traitor. The dead carca&s;es of the corrupted Journeymen are to be kicked about the &s;treets, it &s;eems; while the living Corruptors are to be &s;upported, and united with, ac|cording to an <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed, invariable,</HI> and <HI>con&s;tant</HI> cu&s;tom of the Book&s;ellers of Dublin.&mdash;Will Mr. Faulkner a&s;&s;ert this?</P>
<P>We now come to the tran&s;action which, we &s;uppo&s;e, Mr. Faulk|ner had forgot, having never been reminded of it&mdash;The information of which was given to Mr. Richard&s;on, in a Letter written to him from Dublin, dated Nov. 12. 1741. by an Engli&s;h Printer of character and integrity, then there. <Q REND="inline">"I was ye&s;terday," &s;ays he, "in company with &s;ome Printers that I knew in London: Among other things in conver&s;ation, they familiarly commended Mr. Faulkner's <HI>great diligence</HI> in London; and, after naming &s;everal pieces of which he had procured early copies, I under&s;tood he had been furni&s;hed with the Third and Fourth Volumes of <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;heet by &s;heet, as far as is done, from your Pre&s;s; and is printing them off here with all &s;peed&mdash;The truth of this in|formation," adds he, "may be depended upon."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Faulkner actually printed the&s;e Two Volumes for his own entire benefit, the copy &s;o &s;urreptitiou&s;ly obtained<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In Mr. Richard&s;on's Ca&s;e, he very tenderly mentioned this injury, not naming Mr. Faulkner. It may be wondered, that, after this fla|grant in&s;tance of Mr. Faulkner's <HI>diligence,</HI> as his then Journeymen cho&s;e to call it, Mr. R. had dealings with him for his CLARISSA.&mdash;A very valuable man in bu&s;ine&s;s, Mr. Woodward, who had a good opi|nion of Mr. Faulkner, prevailed upon him to prefer him to any other; and undertook for his integrity. Yet Mr. Richard&s;on was forced to ap|peal to this Mr. Woodward afterwards, for the recovering Thirty Guineas out of Seventy, the con&s;ideration contracted for with Mr. Faulkner, on the preference given him in &s;ending to him the &s;heets of his CLARISSA, as they were printed; and upon who&s;e judgment (but not without proofs given from his own Letters, which, he mu&s;t have &s;uppo&s;ed, were not regularly kept by Mr. Richard&s;on), Mr. Faulkner paid the unju&s;tly-de|tained &s;um.</NOTE>; of
<PB N="10" REF="8">
which &s;ee more p. 22.&mdash;But we will further attend to his printed &s;tate of the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<Q>The Po&s;t following, Mr. Faulkner got eight &s;heets more, and the Book&s;ellers &s;hewed him two Volumes, and &s;aid, they expected more; there being five Volumes of that Hi&s;tory already printed. Upon which Mr. Faulkner wrote to Mr. Richard&s;on not to &s;end him any more of that Work, as it would be u&s;ele&s;s to him: But, that Mr. Richard&s;on &s;hould be no &s;ufferer by any part that Faulkner &s;hould have in this Work, as he would pay him for a fourth or fifth, or any &s;hare he &s;hould have in it;</Q>
<P>Mr. Faulkner &s;taid not for this Po&s;t, as is evident from the very Letter to Mr. R. in which he gives him the intelligence of the injury done him. He tells Mr. Richard&s;on in it, that he received his fir&s;t four &s;heets on the 3d of Augu&s;t. On the 4th, the very next day (&s;uch was his ha&s;te to join with the Corruptors!), he forbid, as above-mentioned, Mr. Richard&s;on to &s;end him any more &s;heets; and &s;ignified his re&s;olution to endeavour to prevail on the A&s;&s;ociates to admit him into their partner&s;hip for a fourth or fifth &s;hare. But then, indeed, he was &s;o gracious as to intimate, that he would pay Mr. Richard&s;on his proportion of the 70 guineas, according to the &s;hare the Pirates would allow him to hold with them; which for a fifth would have been 14 guineas.</P>
<P>As to what he &s;ays of there being four or five Volumes printed before Mr. Richard&s;on &s;ent him any &s;heets, that was not &s;o. Not more than two were completed: Three Volumes more, indeed, were compo&s;ing by different hands in his hou&s;e; but they went on at convenience; Mr. Richard&s;on, as Mr. Faulkner knew, on|ly intending to publi&s;h two at a time; though the Pirates after|wards obliged him to alter his mea&s;ures.</P>
<Q>and, in two or three Letters following (<HI>proceeds Mr. Faulk|ner</HI>), he told Mr. Richard&s;on, that, notwith&s;tanding his ne|glect and delay, in not &s;ending <PB N="11" REF="9"> him the &s;heets directly from the Pre&s;s, which he ought to have done, and not have &s;tayed for the fini&s;hing of five or &s;ix Vo|lumes, it might have prevented what hath happened to all par|ties, and hindered the reprint|ing of any other Edition, but that de&s;igned by the Author for Mr. Faulkner;</Q>
<P><PB N="10" REF="8"><HI>In two or three Letters following,</HI> &s;ays he? How &s;lightly is this mentioned by Mr. Faulkner! He had been parading to Mr. Ri|chard&s;on, from his Letter dated <PB N="11" REF="9"> Aug. 4. to the 15th of Septem+ber; &s;ometimes pretending to de+te&s;t the part his new partners act|ed; &s;ometimes &s;eeming to have it in view to procure Mr. Ri|chard&s;on redre&s;s; at other times to intimidate him into their mea|&s;ures. All which made it nece&s;|&s;ary for Mr. R. either to &s;ubmit to the injury, or to endeavour to lighten the weight of it, by an|ticipating them.</P>
<P>What he &s;ays of the delay in &s;ending the &s;heets directly from the Pre&s;s, as he pronounces Mr. Richard&s;on ought to have done, will be further taken notice of in another place. <HI>See p.</HI> 18.</P>
<Q>yet Mr. Richard&s;on might draw upon him for any Sum not exceeding the contract, and he would pay it;</Q>
<P>This offer was not made till in his Letter of Sept. 15. and at the per&s;ua&s;ion of two of Mr. R's friends, for the &s;ake of his own character; and then it was thus ungracefully expre&s;&s;ed in that Letter&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"However, notwith|&s;tanding their (his partners) ill-treatment of you, <HI>and particu|larly of me</HI> [<HI>which he re&s;ented by joining with them!</HI>] you may draw upon me, at di&s;cretion, for any &s;um you think proper UNDER the &s;um &s;tipulated between you and me; AS I know you to be a man of probity, honour, and con&s;cience."</Q></P>
<P>He had told Mr. Richard&s;on in a former Letter, that he knew he would not &s;uffer him to be <HI>out</HI> of pocket.</P>
<P>He adds, <Q REND="inline">"I blu&s;h for my Brethren" [But why &s;o, if they have done nothing but what he could con&s;cientiou&s;ly have joined them in, according to the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed, invariable, con&s;tant</HI> cu&s;tom of the Book&s;ellers in Dublin?] "But let them," proceeds he, "an&s;wer for it at the <HI>great day of account.</HI> I <HI>know</HI> that you have been <HI>much,</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t injuriou&s;ly, villainou&s;ly,</HI> and <HI>unprecedentedly,</HI> treated by your more than helli&s;h, wicked, and CORRUPTED &s;ervants."</Q> By whom corrupted? Let him an&s;wer. Might he not as well have named his new partners?</P>
<Q>and further, that if Mr. Ri|chard&s;on would acquit him of the contract,</Q>
<P>Mr. Faulkner knows, that Mr. Richard&s;on never once hinted holding him to it. The &s;um &s;ti|pulated for, was to be paid for &s;ending him the &s;heets before publication; and the contract was virtually at an end, when, after receiving the fir&s;t parcel, he for|bad Mr. Richard&s;on &s;ending any more to him. Nor could Mr. Faulkner think him&s;elf under any, when, in the &s;ame Letter in
<PB N="12" REF="10">
which he gave notice of the inva&s;ion, he prohibited &s;ending him any more of the &s;heets, and declared him&s;elf, with as much &s;e|datene&s;s, as if it were a thing of cour&s;e, determined to attach him&s;elf to the Corruptors. His offer afterwards to pay a &s;um un|der that &s;tipulated for, was, that he and his new partners might go on unmole&s;tedly in reaping the fruits of their ba&s;ene&s;s: Nor is it improbable, that their refu&s;al to con&s;ent to pay their parts, was owing to their view of intimidating Mr. Richard&s;on, by means of their new partner, to give a &s;anction to it, which Mr. R. had refu&s;ed to do; in which ca&s;e, Mr. Faulkner, who has &s;o happy a talent of di&s;playing his merits, would hardly have found him&s;elf a &s;ufferer, when he and his confederates had come to divide the &s;poil.</P>
<Q>or de&s;ire him to withdraw from his partner&s;hip with the Book&s;ellers, he would do it:</Q>
<P>Strange man! He never hint|ed to Mr. Richard&s;on, that <HI>his</HI> de&s;ire of this would determine him. Indeed, in his Letter of September 15. he &s;ays, by way of po&s;t&s;cript, <Q REND="inline">"I would be glad to exonerate my&s;elf from <HI>this &s;et of men;</HI> and will do it, if po&s;|&s;ible, at all events."</Q> But, for a con&s;iderable time after this, he continued their willing partner; and made a merit to his other partners in the piracy of refu&s;ing to Mr. Richard&s;on the common civility of his News-paper, to do him&s;elf rea&s;onable ju&s;tice.

October 2. 1753. Mr. Faulkner writes to Mr. Richard&s;on, ex|pre&s;&s;ing his &s;urprize that he had not an an&s;wer to his of the 15th pa&s;t; wi&s;hes in it, that Mr. R. had taken more time to con&s;ider his Ca&s;e before he publi&s;hed it; and blames him for the delay in &s;ending him the &s;heets, to which he a&s;cribes the cau&s;e of all that had happened from the Pirates. He refers him&s;elf to a Letter written to Mr. R. in his favour, by a worthy friend of Mr. R. who had been induced to think well of him from his offers of making an affidavit, to prove upon the Confederates their being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tolen goods, and to remit to Mr. R. the whole &s;um &s;tipulated for between them at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The Gentleman <HI>did</HI> write a warm Letter in Mr. F's behalf. Mr. Richard&s;on laid before him, in an&s;wer, the &s;tate of the Ca&s;e, from the Letters that had pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Faulkner and him. The Gentleman then put the &s;incerity of Mr. F's offered &s;ervices to the te&s;t; and was &s;oon convinced that Mr. R. had nothing to expect from him. Mr. Richard&s;on has not a&s;ked the Gentleman's leave to give particulars. Mr. Faulkner, about the &s;ame time, appealed to &s;everal Gentlemen of character in London, as an innocent man; and even de&s;ired them to &s;hew what he had written to them to Mr. Richard|&s;on.

Did he &s;tipulate with them for me <HI>one</HI> favourable con|dition
<PB N="17" REF="15">
[on his admi&s;&s;ion among them]? Have they not refu&s;ed terms which he (though without my de&s;ire) propo&s;ed to them; and &s;et me at ab&s;olute defiance?

Yet, <HI>did</HI> he not, <HI>does</HI> he not to this hour, continue his partner&s;hip with them, to the depriving me of all manner of a&s;&s;i&s;tance that he might have afforded me; and to the obliging me to throw my|&s;elf into other hands, in order to di&s;appoint the Confederates of the immoral gains they propo&s;ed to them&s;elves? And &s;hall I forbear, for the &s;ake of <HI>the whole Republic of Letters,</HI> affected by &s;o ba&s;e a proceeding, endeavouring to make an example of the&s;e men, in&s;tead of meanly compromi&s;ing with them, and giving a <HI>&s;anction</HI> to &s;o vile a corruption?&mdash;The&s;e my reflexions, what unwillingne&s;s mu&s;t I have to an&s;wer your Letter? Your offer, though very ungraciou&s;ly made me (of the whole &s;um to one of my friends, of any thing UNDER the &s;um to <HI>me</HI>) might appear to you a magnificent one: But, Sir, you know me not.

This made me loth to &s;it down to an&s;wer your Letter; yet, in mine to one of my worthy friends, I told him, that you were very &s;afe in making that offer to me.</P>
<P>"<HI>I have &s;een,</HI> &s;ay you, <HI>your Ca&s;e; and what you have &s;aid of me.</HI> I de&s;igned you &s;hould.

Dear Sir, what &s;elf-partiality mu&s;t you have to write to me as you have written of your own honour in every Letter; and &s;o to &s;et off the part you have acted in this tran&s;action, as could induce one of the worthie&s;t men in Ireland to write &s;o warmly in your ju&s;tification? I write rather with an expo&s;tulatory &s;pirit than an angry one. Take advice of your own heart, and I &s;hall have a te&s;t of the goodne&s;s of that heart, or otherwi&s;e, as it ac|quits or condemns you.

<P>"<HI>Had I &s;ent you the &s;heets from the Pre&s;s as wrought</HI>&mdash;So it is my own fault that I am thus ba&s;ely invaded! But it becomes my character to tell you frankly, that I balanced in my mind, whether I &s;hould deal with you at all, tho' I offered not to en|gage
<PB N="18" REF="16">
with any other. The hint I have given of your treatment of me in <HI>Clari&s;&s;a,</HI> was the occa&s;ion of my balancing. But, as you had &s;eemed to approve what you had &s;een of the piece, when la&s;t in London, and had expectation of it, I was loth to di&s;appoint you&mdash;And as I was re&s;olved to publi&s;h but two Vo|lumes at a time, as I told you, I plea&s;ed my&s;elf that you would have full time to print them, as I proceeded. Little did I think my&s;elf, with &s;uch precautions as I had taken, un&s;afe; for I knew not that there were in Dublin &s;uch men as tho&s;e to whom you joined your&s;elf. And is it not a grievous hard&s;hip upon the London Printers to find that Mr. Faulkner &s;eems to think, that copies of their property are much more &s;ecure in the hands of Dublin Book&s;ellers and Printers, than in their own, before pub|lication."</P>
<P>"Indeed, Sir, you might have been of &s;ervice to me, of &s;ervice to your&s;elf, and done honour to your name, your trade, your country, all affronted by this ba&s;e proceeding. The fair path was before you: Why would you, by joining your&s;elf with the&s;e men, in an action which you ju&s;tly call <HI>&s;candalous, wicked, unprecedented,</HI> give a &s;anction to the <HI>nefarious</HI> proceeding? Why per&s;evere in it; and, by &s;o doing, deprive of all a&s;&s;i&s;tance, all redre&s;s by your means, the man of who&s;e ju&s;tice you had no doubt; who was in treaty with you; who confided in you?&mdash;<HI>You blu&s;h for your Brethren,</HI> you &s;ay in a former Letter&mdash;Ah! my dear Sir, forgive me for &s;aying, that often and often have I blu&s;hed for you from the beginning of Augu&s;t la&s;t."</P>

<P>But <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> Mr. Faulkner had not received that Letter, when he wrote the following.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>Dublin, <DATE><HI>Oct.</HI> 20. 1753.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"Notwith&s;tanding you have not been plea&s;ed to an&s;wer any of my three la&s;t Letters, yet I think proper to acquaint you, that I have broke off all partner&s;hip with the <HI>three</HI> Book&s;ellers" [The <HI>fourth</HI> &s;till &s;ecreted] "who &s;o <HI>wickedly</HI> and <HI>injuriou&s;ly</HI> treated you and <HI>me</HI> in the Hi&s;tory of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; and that I have not, nor &s;hall have, any part or &s;hare whatever in the <HI>pirated Edition;</HI> the copy of which was &s;o BASELY and FRAUDULENT|LY obtained. This I was determined upon <HI>from the beginning;</HI> and only <HI>waited for your po&s;itive commands</HI>" [What a man is this!] "to concur with me in the&s;e &s;entiments. If you print an|other ca&s;e, or publi&s;h any adverti&s;ement relative to this affair, I make no doubt but you will do ju&s;tice to the much injured, altho' very much your mo&s;t obedient and mo&s;t humble &s;ervant,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>After this Letter, could it be credited, had it not been publi&s;hed by him&s;elf, that he was the Author of the paragraph of November 3. 1753. before animadverted upon; by which he would make the world believe, that, in joining with the Undertakers of this pi|rated Edition, he and they had done no more than was warranted by the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed, invariable, con&s;tant</HI> cu&s;toms of the Dublin Book|&s;ellers?</P>
<P>In a Letter written by one of Mr. Richard&s;on's friends, dated Dublin October 27. intimation was given him, that the A&s;&s;ociates propo&s;ed to &s;urrender up all they had printed, which they gave in as near Two Volumes only, at prime co&s;t, amounting to &s;ome|what above 50 pounds. Mr. Richard&s;on wrote back his willing|ne&s;s to be the purcha&s;er; but &s;ome new chicane &s;eemed to be de|&s;igned by this overture; for, in a fortnight or three weeks after, they were ready to publi&s;h Six Volumes.</P>
<P>They accordingly publi&s;hed them; but, as hath been ob&s;erved, without putting any Book&s;ellers names to the Titles; and tho' the genuine edition was put at the price &s;uch books are generally &s;old for in Ireland, they, as Mr. Faulkner had foretold, under&s;old the Edition of the lawful Proprietor.</P>
<P>Mr. Richard&s;on will not, were it true, report, that the &s;aving of Two Shillings (in the purcha&s;e of <HI>Six</HI> Volumes, the price of which cannot be found fault with) will be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on with the Gentlemen and Ladies of Ireland, to prefer the <Q REND="inline">"pirated Edition, the copy of which, to borrow Mr. Faulkner's words, in his
<PB REF="19">
Letter of Oct. 20. was &s;o <HI>ba&s;ely</HI> and <HI>fraudulently</HI> obtained."</Q> But he has been heard to take comfort in the following pa&s;&s;age tran&s;cribed from the Letter of a friend to him: <Q REND="inline">"What I fear, is, that the high merit of the Work will procure the Pirates more cu&s;tomers than I wi&s;h. But as it is inimitably well calculated to do good, the injury done you, will certainly afford me one &s;a|tisfaction, and a great one; that the excellent Performance will be more univer&s;ally read, for the bu&s;tle that hath been made about it. Who knows, dear Sir, but the glorious Sir CHARLES may teach &s;ome hone&s;ty and dignity of &s;oul, even to him who buys it, as &s;tolen goods, a few &s;hillings lower from the Pirates than he could from you."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ecreting the name of the Fourth Book&s;eller has been often mentioned above. Mr. Richard&s;on wrote to one of his friends in Ireland his &s;u&s;picions as to the per&s;on, grounded on facts that had been communicated to him by another friend re&s;iding in Dublin. This produced the following pa&s;&s;age in the an&s;wer of the Gentle|man, dated October 22. 1753.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"From what you &s;ay of a <HI>fourth</HI> per&s;on, not named either to you, or to your friends here, I gue&s;s it was that very per&s;on who corrupted your &s;ervants, and furni&s;hed the three Book|&s;ellers named, with the &s;heets. The&s;e three name them&s;elves in the Title-pages they at fir&s;t po&s;ted up, becau&s;e, perhaps, no corruption can be <HI>proved</HI> on them; but conceal the fourth A&s;|&s;ociate, le&s;t he &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted. If this is the ca&s;e, and nothing can be more probable (for Wil&s;on hath, by affidavit before the Lord Mayor, purged him&s;elf of the <HI>corruption,</HI> and Ex&s;haw and Saunders declare they can do the &s;ame), then Mr. ******** is &s;till more evidently the &s;candalous A&s;&s;ociate of the Corruptors, ina&s;much as he conceals the mo&s;t criminal, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, abets the re&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>Be this as it may, the&s;e <HI>three</HI> men cannot clear them&s;elves of the piracy founded on that corruption, and of the parts they acted, and propo&s;ed further to act, in extending the injury to France and Scotland, as charged in Mr. Faulkner's Letters of Sept. 8. and 15. before-cited.</P>
<P>The Pirates have endeavoured to make a National cau&s;e of the tran&s;action. But is not the Nationality of the&s;e men a cover for the ba&s;e&s;t Selfi&s;hne&s;s? Are Me&s;&s;ieurs Ex&s;haw, Wil&s;on, Saunders, and the fourth concealed per&s;on, and Mr. Faulkner joined with them, the Iri&s;h nation?</P>
<P>Mr. Faulkner, in one of his Letters to Mr. Richard&s;on, &s;u&s;pect|ing Mr. Main would be employed by him, though then Mr. R. had not mentioned him, nor even thought of him, &s;tigmatizes him <HI>as a Scoti&s;h agent.</HI> But may we not a&s;k, What are the&s;e Book|&s;ellers of Dublin, that they think them&s;elves intitled to prey upon the property of every other man in every nation round them; yet
<PB N="22" REF="20">
join to hunt down any other &s;ubject of the &s;ame Prince, if he at|tempt to get bread among, or near, them?</P>
<P>Mr. Richard&s;on has been accu&s;ed in an Iri&s;h public Paper, of having formerly engaged with a Mr. Bacon, of Dublin, in a &s;cheme which, the Author of that Paper &s;ays, was likely to be very detrimental to the Printers and Book&s;ellers of Dublin in general.</P>
<P>This was the fact: Mr. Bacon, an ingenious man, now in or|ders, an Iri&s;hman, or one who had always had his connexions with that kingdom, and profe&s;&s;ed a love even to partiality for it, kept a coffeehou&s;e, of note and credit, in Dublin, at which were frequently held auctions for books, and merchandize. He had been concerned with the Pre&s;s as a Corrector, and propo&s;ed to &s;et up a public Paper there, and to take up his freedom of the Com|pany of Stationers in Dublin. He did both. The latter in the month of November 1741. The Paper was called <HI>The Gazette.</HI> The Adverti&s;ements of the Public Offices were printed in it. He &s;et up entirely on the Iri&s;h footing, and purpo&s;ed to employ Iri&s;h Printers, to buy his paper of Iri&s;h Stationers, and to avail him&s;elf, as other Iri&s;h Printers and Book&s;ellers made it their endeavour to do, of &s;uch copies of books publi&s;hed in London as he could pro|cure early, and <HI>fairly, by con&s;ent of the Proprietors.</HI>&mdash;Crime enough in that, perhaps! for Mr. Faulkner, at contracting with Mr. Ri|chard&s;on, was de&s;irous that his Dublin Brethren &s;hould not know that he gave <HI>any</HI> con&s;ideration for the liberty of reprinting <HI>The Hi&s;tory of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</HI> Mr. Bacon was an ab&s;olute &s;tran|ger to Mr. Richard&s;on, brought to him by Mr. Thomas O&s;borne, of Gray's-inn; and Mr. Richard&s;on then knowing not any other Iri&s;h Book&s;eller, or Printer, and being about to publi&s;h his Third and Fourth Volumes of <HI>Pamela,</HI> was induced to enter into agree|ment with him, and to furni&s;h him with the &s;heets as they came from his Pre&s;s, <HI>in order to his reprinting them in Dublin.</HI> The &s;heets were accordingly &s;ent him over: But Mr. Faulkner, as is before-mentioned, p. 9. having, by his extraordinary <HI>diligence,</HI> clande&s;tinely got at the &s;heets as printed at Mr. Richard&s;on's, he (Mr. Bacon) was deprived of the intended benefit; and al&s;o fore|&s;talled in the &s;ale of the genuine Edition; 250 of which were &s;ent him, in re&s;entment of &s;uch ba&s;e treatment.</P>
<P>Tho' Mr. Bacon's pro&s;pects were at that time very favourable; and tho' he wanted not any other &s;ort of <HI>diligence,</HI> but that for which &s;ome of his Brethren have made them&s;elves famous; yet Mr. Richard&s;on's concern with him, to Mr. Bacon's great regret, held but one year. And his furni&s;hing Mr. Bacon with the &s;heets of <HI>Pamela,</HI> Vol. III. IV. <HI>to be reprinted in Ireland;</HI> his engagement, &s;ome years afterwards, to &s;end over to Mr. Faulkner the &s;heets of <HI>Clari&s;&s;a, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his treatment of him
<PB N="23" REF="21">
in <HI>Pamela;</HI> and tho&s;e of his <HI>Grandi&s;on</HI> now lately, notwith&s;tanding his treatment of him in <HI>Clari&s;&s;a;</HI> evidently demon&s;trate that he had no intention to interfere with the Book&s;ellers and Printers of Dublin, by &s;ending over his books ready printed, till the atrocious injury he received, and the determined per&s;everance of the In|jurers, made him think it advi&s;eable to endeavour to anticipate Confederates, who had &s;o vilely, by the corruption of his &s;ervants, as hath been often &s;aid, obtained the power of hurting him in a property <HI>&s;o ab&s;olutely his own.</HI></P>
<P>This further may be &s;aid, That Mr. R. printed not a number, with a view of &s;ending any over to Ireland: But &s;uch a one only as his friends thought rather &s;hort of an&s;wering the Engli&s;h de|mand; and it has proved, that all he &s;ent over to Dublin would have been &s;old in England at a <HI>better</HI> price, as Printing and Paper here are more co&s;tly than in Ireland; tho' he had cau&s;ed them to be &s;old in Dublin at the Iri&s;h price, from the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. R. has been put to great expence by the&s;e men, and to great trouble in the altercation with them. But he is bringing him&s;elf to look upon their unprovoked treatment of him, as a puni&s;hment for a&s;&s;uming the pen, at the expence of his health, and to the giv|ing up every rational amu&s;ement, when he had a bu&s;ine&s;s upon his hands which was enough to employ his whole attention; and which, as his <HI>principal</HI> care, he never neglected.</P>
<P>It has been more than once &s;aid, that this Cau&s;e is the Cau&s;e of Literature, in general; and it may be added, it is even <HI>that</HI> of the hone&s;t Book&s;ellers and Printers of both Nations: We therefore hope that our prolixity will be forgiven.</P>
<P>We will take upon us to add, that <HI>every</HI> man in Mr. R's &s;tation has not the &s;pirit, the will, the independence, to hang out lights to his Cotemporaries, to enable them to avoid Savages, who hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to plunder a ve&s;&s;el even before it becomes a wreck.</P>
