<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Repre&s;entation now given to the Public relates to &s;ome of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential privileges of the Hou&s;e of Commons. It would appear of little importance, if it were to be judged by its reception in the place where it was propo&s;ed. There it was rejected without debate. The &s;ubject matter may, perhaps, here|after appear to merit a more &s;erious con&s;ideration. Thinking men will &s;carcely regard the <HI>penal</HI> di&s;&s;olution of a Parliament as a very trifling concern. Such a di&s;&s;olution mu&s;t operate forcibly as an example; and it much imports the people of this kingdom to con|&s;ider what le&s;&s;on that example is to teach.</P>
<P>The late Hou&s;e of Commons was not accu&s;ed of an intere&s;ted compliance to the will of a Court. The charge again&s;t them was of a different nature. They were charged with being actuated by an extravagant &s;pirit of independency. This &s;pecies of offence is &s;o clo&s;ely connected with merit; this vice bears &s;o near a re&s;em|blance to virtue; that the flight of an Hou&s;e of Commons above the exact temperate medium of independence, ought to be cor|rectly a&s;certained, le&s;t we give encouragement to di&s;po&s;itions of a le&s;s generous nature, and le&s;s &s;afe for the people; we ought to call for very &s;olid and convincing proofs of the exi&s;tence, and of the magnitude too of the evils, which are charged to an independent &s;pirit, before we give &s;anction to any mea&s;ure, that by checking a
<PB N="2" REF="3">
&s;pirit &s;o ea&s;ily damped, and &s;o hard to be excited, may affect the liberty of a part of our Con&s;titution, which, if not free, is wor&s;e than u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The Editor does not deny, that by po&s;&s;ibility &s;uch an abu&s;e may exi&s;t: But <HI>prim&acirc; fronte,</HI> there is no rea&s;on to pre&s;ume it. The Hou&s;e of Commons is not, by its complexion, peculiarly &s;ubject to the di&s;tempers of an independent habit. Very little compul&s;ion is nece&s;&s;ary, on the part of the people, to render it abundantly com|plai&s;ant to Mini&s;ters, and favourites of all de&s;criptions. It required a great length of time, very con&s;iderable indu&s;try and per&s;everance, no vulgar policy, the union of many men and many tempers, and the concurrence of events which do not happen every day, to build up an independent Hou&s;e of Commons. Its demolition was accom|pli&s;hed in a moment; and it was the work of ordinary hands. But to con&s;truct is a matter of &s;kill; to demoli&s;h, force and fury are &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>The late Hou&s;e of Commons has been puni&s;hed for its indepen|dence. That example is made. Have we an example on record, of an Hou&s;e of Commons puni&s;hed for its &s;ervility? The rewards of a Senate &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, are manife&s;t to the world. Several Gentlemen are very de&s;irous of altering the con&s;titution of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons: But they mu&s;t alter the frame and con&s;titution of human nature it&s;elf, before they can &s;o fa&s;hion it by any mode of election, that its conduct will not be influenced by reward and puni&s;hment; by fame and by di&s;grace. If the&s;e examples take root in the minds of men, what Members hereafter will be bold enough not to be corrupt? E&s;pecially as the King's highway of ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s is &s;o very broad and ea&s;y. To make a pa&s;&s;ive Member of Parliament, no dignity of mind, no principles of honour, no re&s;olution, no
<PB N="3" REF="4">
ability, no indu&s;try, no learning, no experience are in the lea&s;t degree nece&s;&s;ary. To defend a po&s;t of importance again&s;t a powerful enemy, requires an Elliot;&mdash;a drunken invalid is qualified to hoi&s;t a white flag, or to deliver up the keys of the fortre&s;s on his knees.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen cho&s;en into this Parliament, for the purpo&s;e of this &s;urrender, were bred to better things; and are no doubt qualified for other &s;ervice. But for this &s;trenuous exertion of inactivity, for the vigorous ta&s;k of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and pa&s;&s;ive obedience, all their learning and ability are rather a matter of per&s;onal orna|ment to them&s;elves, than of the lea&s;t u&s;e in the performance of their duty.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;urrender, therefore, of rights and privileges, without examination, and the re&s;olution to &s;upport any Mini&s;ter given by the &s;ecret advi&s;ers of the Crown, determines not only on all the power and authority of the Hou&s;e, but it &s;ettles the character and de&s;cription of the men who are to compo&s;e it; and perpetuates that character as long as it may be thought expedient to keep up a phantom of popular repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>It is for the chance of &s;ome amendment before this new &s;ettle|ment takes a permanent form, and while the matter is yet &s;oft and ductile, that the Editor has re-publi&s;hed this piece, and added &s;ome notes and explanations to it. His intentions, he hopes, will excu&s;e him to the original mover, and to the world. He acts from a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of the incurable ill effects of holding out the conduct of the late Hou&s;e of Commons, as an example to be &s;hunned by future repre&s;entatives of the people.</P>

<HEAD>MOTION, RELATIVE TO THE SPEECH from the THRONE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Lunae,</HI> 14^o <HI>Die Junij,</HI> 1784.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>A MOTION was made, That a repre&s;entation be pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, mo&s;t humbly to offer to his Royal con&s;idera|tion, that the Addre&s;s of this Hou&s;e upon his Maje&s;ty's Speech from the Throne, was dictated &s;olely by our conviction of his Maje&s;ty's own mo&s;t gracious intentions towards his people, which, as we feel with gratitude, &s;o we are ever ready to acknowledge with chearfulne&s;s and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e &s;entiments, we were willing to &s;eparate from our general expre&s;&s;ions of duty, re&s;pect, and veneration to his Maje&s;ty's royal per&s;on and his princely virtues, all di&s;cu&s;&s;ion what|ever with relation to &s;everal of the matters &s;ugge&s;ted, and &s;everal of the expre&s;&s;ions employed, in that &s;peech.</P>
<P>That is was not fit or becoming, that any decided opinion &s;hould be formed by his faithful Commons, on that &s;peech, without a degree of deliberation adequate to the importance of the object.
<PB N="2" REF="7">
Having afforded our&s;elves due time for that deliberation, we do now mo&s;t humbly beg leave to repre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty, that, in the &s;peech from the Throne, his Mini&s;ters have thought proper to u&s;e a language of a very alarming import, unauthorized by the practice of good times, and irreconcileable to the principles of this Go|vernment.</P>
<P>Humbly to expre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, that it is the privilege and duty of this Hou&s;e to guard the Con&s;titution from all infringement on the part of Mini&s;ters; and, whenever the occa&s;ion requires it, to warn them again&s;t any abu&s;e of the authorities committed to them: but it is very lately<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See King's Speech, Dec. 5, 1782, and May 19, 1784.</NOTE>, that, in a manner not more un&s;eemly than irregular and prepo&s;terous, Mini&s;ters have thought proper, by admonition from the Throne implying di&s;tru&s;t and reproach, to convey the expectations of the people to us, their &s;ole repre|&s;entatives<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I will never &s;ubmit to the doctrines I have heard this day from the Wool&s;ack, that the other Hou&s;e [Hou&s;e of Commons] are the only repre&s;entatives and guardians of the people's rights, I boldly maintain the contrary&mdash;I &s;ay this Hou&s;e [Hou&s;e of Lords] <HI>is equally the repre&s;entatives of the people.</HI>" <BIBL><HI>Lord Shelburne's Speech, April</HI> 8, 1778. <HI>Vide Parliamentary Regi&s;ter,</HI> vol. 10, page 392.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>; and have pre&s;umed to caution us, the natural guardians of the Con&s;titution, again&s;t any infringement of it on our parts.</P>
<P>This dangerous innovation we, his faithful Commons, think it our duty to mark; and as the&s;e admonitions from the Throne, by their frequent repetition, &s;eem intended to lead gradually to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an u&s;age, we hold our&s;elves bound thus &s;olemnly to prote&s;t again&s;t them.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e will be, as it ever ought to be, anxiou&s;ly attentive to the inclinations and intere&s;ts of its con&s;tituents: nor do we de&s;ire to &s;traiten any of the avenues to the Throne, or to either Hou&s;e of Par|liament.
<PB N="3" REF="8">
But the ancient order, in which the rights of the people have been exerci&s;ed, is not a re&s;triction of the&s;e rights. It is a method providently framed in favour of tho&s;e privileges, which it pre&s;erves and enforces by keeping in that cour&s;e which has been found the mo&s;t effectual for an&s;wering their ends. His Maje&s;ty may receive the opinions and wi&s;hes of individuals under their &s;ignatures, and of bodies corporate under their &s;eals, as expre&s;&s;ing their own particular &s;en&s;e: and he may grant &s;uch redre&s;s as the legal powers of the Crown enables the Crown to afford. This, and the other Hou&s;e of Parliament, may al&s;o receive the wi&s;hes of &s;uch corpora|tions and individuals by petition. The collective &s;en&s;e of his people his Maje&s;ty is to receive from his Commons in Parliament a&s;&s;embled. It would de&s;troy the whole &s;pirit of the Con&s;titution, if his Com|mons were to receive that &s;en&s;e from the Mini&s;ters of the Crown, or to admit them to be a proper or a regular channel for convey|ing it.</P>
<P>That the Mini&s;ters in the &s;aid Speech declare, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"His Maje&s;ty has a ju&s;t and confident reliance, that we (his faithful Commons) are animated with the &s;ame &s;entiments of loyalty, and the &s;ame attachment to our excellent Con&s;titution, which he had the happine&s;s to &s;ee &s;o fully manife&s;ted in every part of the king|dom."</Q></P>
<P>To repre&s;ent, that his faithful Commons have never failed in loyalty to his Maje&s;ty. It is new to them to be reminded of it. It is unnece&s;&s;ary and invidious to pre&s;s it upon them by any example. This recommendation of loyalty, after his Maje&s;ty has &s;at for &s;o many years, with the full &s;upport of all de&s;criptions of his &s;ubjects, on the Throne of this kingdom, at a time of profound peace, and without any pretence of the exi&s;tence or apprehen&s;ion of war or
<PB N="4" REF="9">
con&s;piracy, becomes in it&s;elf a &s;ource of no &s;mall jealou&s;y to his faithful Commons; as many circum&s;tances lead us to apprehend that therein the Mini&s;ters have reference to &s;ome other mea&s;ures and principles of loyalty, and to &s;ome other ideas of the Con&s;titution, than the laws require, or the practice of Parliament will admit.</P>
<P>No regular communication of the proofs of loyalty and attach|ment to the Con&s;titution, alluded to in the &s;peech from the Throne, have been laid before this Hou&s;e, in order to enable us to judge of the nature, tendency, or occa&s;ion of them; or in what particular acts they were di&s;played: but if we are to &s;uppo&s;e the manife&s;tations of loyalty (which are held out to us as an example for imitation) con&s;i&s;t in certain Addre&s;&s;es delivered to his Maje&s;ty, promi&s;ing &s;upport to his Maje&s;ty in the exerci&s;e of his prerogative, and thanking his Maje&s;ty for removing certain of his Mini&s;ters, on account of the votes they have given upon bills depending in Parliament,&mdash;if this be the example of loyalty alluded to in the &s;peech from the Throne, then we mu&s;t beg leave to expre&s;s our &s;erious concern for the im|pre&s;&s;ion which has been made on any of our fellow-&s;ubjects by mi&s;|repre&s;entations, which have &s;educed them into a &s;eeming approba|tion of proceedings &s;ubver&s;ive of their own freedom. We conceive, that the opinions delivered in the&s;e papers were not well con&s;idered; nor were the parties duly informed of the nature of the matters on which they were called to determine, nor of tho&s;e proceedings of Parliament which they were led to cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>We &s;hall act more advi&s;edly.&mdash;The loyalty we &s;hall manife&s;t will not be the &s;ame with theirs; but, we tru&s;t, it will be equally &s;incere, and more enlightened. It is no &s;light authority which &s;hall per&s;uade us (by receiving as proofs of loyalty the mi&s;taken principles lightly taken up in the&s;e addre&s;&s;es) obliquely to criminate, with the heavy and
<PB N="5" REF="10">
ungrounded charge of di&s;loyalty and di&s;affection, an uncorrupt, in|dependent, and reforming Parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In that Parliament the Hou&s;e of Commons by two &s;everal re&s;olutions put an end to the American War. Immediately on the change of Mini&s;try, which en&s;ued, in order to &s;ecure their own independence, and to prevent the accumulation of new burthens on the people by the growth of a Civil Li&s;t debt, they pa&s;&s;ed the E&s;tabli&s;hment Bill. By that Bill thirty-&s;ix offices tenable by Members of Parliament were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and an order of payment was framed, by which the growth of any fre&s;h debt was rendered impracticable. The debt on the Civil Li&s;t from the beginning of the pre&s;ent reign had amounted to one million three hundred thou&s;and pounds and upwards. Another act was pa&s;&s;ed for regulating the office of the Payma&s;ter General, and the offices &s;ubordinate to it. A million of public money had &s;ometimes been in the hands of the Payma&s;ters: this act prevented the po&s;&s;ibility of any money what&s;oever being accumulated in that office in future. The offices of the Exchequer who&s;e emoluments in time of war were exce&s;&s;ive; and grew in exact proportion to the public burthens, were regulated; &s;ome of them &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the re&s;t reduced to fixed &s;alaries. To &s;ecure the freedom of election again&s;t the Crown, a bill was pa&s;&s;ed to di&s;qualify all officers concerned in the collection of the revenue in any of its branches from voting in elections; a mo&s;t important act, not only with regard to its primary object, the freedom of election, but as materially forwarding the due collection of revenue. For the &s;ame end, (the pre&s;erving the freedom of election) the Hou&s;e re&s;einded the famous judgment relative to the Middle&s;ex Election, and expunged it from the Journals. On the principle of reformation of their own Hou&s;e, connected with a principle of public oeconomy, an act pa&s;&s;ed for rendering contractors with Government incapable of a &s;eat in Parliament. The India Bill, (unfortunately lo&s;t in the Hou&s;e of Lords) pur&s;ued the &s;ame idea to its completion; and di&s;abled all &s;ervants of the Ea&s;t-India Company from a &s;eat in that Hou&s;e for a certain time, and until their conduct was examined into and cleared. The remedy of infinite corruptions and of infinite di&s;orders and oppre&s;&s;ions, as well as the &s;ecurity of the mo&s;t important objects of public oeconomy, peri&s;hed with that bill and that Parliament. That Parliament al&s;o in&s;tituted a Committee to enquire into the collec|tion of the Revenue in all its branches, which pro&s;ecuted its duty with great vigour; and &s;ugge&s;ted &s;everal material improvements.</NOTE>. Above all, we &s;hall take care that none of the rights and privileges, always claimed, and &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty's illu&s;trious Family con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed by this Hou&s;e (and which we hold and exerci&s;e in tru&s;t for the Commons of Great Britain, and for their benefit) &s;hall be con&s;tructively &s;urrendered, or even weakened and impaired under
<PB N="6" REF="11">
ambiguous phra&s;es, and implications of cen&s;ure on the late Parlia|mentary proceedings. If the&s;e claims are not well-founded, they ought to be hone&s;tly abandoned; if they are ju&s;t, they ought to be &s;teadily and re&s;olutely maintained.</P>
<P>Of his Maje&s;ty's own gracious di&s;po&s;ition towards the true prin|ciples of our free con&s;titution, his faithful Commons never did, or could, entertain a doubt: but we humbly beg leave to expre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty our unea&s;ine&s;s concerning other new and unu&s;ual expre&s;|&s;ions of his Mini&s;ters, declaratory of a re&s;olution <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to &s;upport, in their <HI>ju&s;t balance,</HI> the rights and privileges of every branch of the Legi&s;lature."</Q></P>
<P>It were de&s;irable that all hazardous theories concerning a balance of rights and privileges (a mode of expre&s;&s;ion wholly foreign to Parliamentary u&s;age) might have been forborne. His Maje&s;ty's faithful Commons are well in&s;tructed in their own rights and pri|vileges, which they are determined to maintain on the footing upon which they were handed down from their ance&s;tors: They are not unacquainted with the rights and privileges of the Hou&s;e of Peers; and they know and re&s;pect the lawful prerogatives of the Crown: But they do not think it &s;afe to admit any thing concerning the exi&s;tence of a balance of tho&s;e rights, privileges, and prerogatives; nor are they able to di&s;cern to what objects Mini&s;ters would apply their fiction of a balance; nor what they would con&s;ider as a ju&s;t one. The&s;e unauthorized doctrines have a tendency to &s;tir impro|per di&s;cu&s;&s;ions; and to lead to mi&s;chievous innovations in the Con&s;titution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>If the&s;e &s;peculations are let loo&s;e, the Hou&s;e of Lords may quarrel with their &s;hare of the Legi&s;lature, as being limited with regard to the origination of grants to the Crown, and the origination of Money Bills. The advi&s;ers of the Crown may think proper to bring its negative into ordinary u&s;e; and even to di&s;pute, whether a mere negative, com|pared with the deliberative power, exerci&s;ed in the other Hou&s;es, be &s;uch a &s;hare in the Legi&s;lature, as to produce a due balance in favour of that branch; and thus ju&s;tify the previous interference of the Crown, in the manner lately u&s;ed. The following will &s;erve to &s;hew how much foundation there is for great caution, concerning the&s;e novel &s;peculations. Lord Shelburne, in his celebrated &s;peech, April 8th, 1778, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf as follows: Vide <HI>Parliamentary Regi&s;ter,</HI> Vol. X.</P>

I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee the matter fully and fairly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and the &s;ubject brought forward and argued upon precedent as well as all its collateral relations.

At pre&s;ent I beg leave to differ from the noble and learned Lord; for until the claim, after a &s;olemn di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e, is openly and directly relinqui&s;hed, I &s;hall continue to be of opinion, that your Lord&s;hips have a right to <HI>alter, amend,</HI> or reject a Money Bill."</Q></P>

The late Hou&s;e of Commons finding Bills to an immen&s;e amount, drawn upon that body by their &s;ervants abroad, and knowing their cir|cum&s;tances to be exceedingly doubtful, came to a re&s;olution providently cautioning the Lords of the Trea&s;ury again&s;t the acceptance of the&s;e Bills, until the Hou&s;e &s;hould other|wi&s;e direct. The Court Lords then took occa&s;ion to declare again&s;t the re&s;olution as illegal, by the Commons undertaking to direct in the execution of a tru&s;t created by Act of Parliament. The Hou&s;e ju&s;tly alarmed at this re&s;olution, which went to the de&s;truction of the whole of its &s;uperintending capacity, and particularly in matters relative to its own province of money, directed a Committee to &s;earch the Journals, and they found a regular &s;eries of precedents, commencing from the remote&s;t of tho&s;e records, and carried on to that day, by which it appeared, that the Hou&s;e had interfered by an authoritative advice and ad|monition, upon every act of executive Government without exception; and in many much &s;tronger ca&s;es than that which the Lords thought proper to quarrel with.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Fearing, from the&s;e extraordinary admonitions, and from the new Doctrines, which &s;eem to have dictated &s;everal unu&s;ual expre&s;&s;ions, that his Maje&s;ty has been abu&s;ed by fal&s;e repre&s;entations of the late proceedings in Parliament, we think it our duty re&s;pectfully to inform his Maje&s;ty, that no attempt whatever has been made again&s;t his lawful prerogatives, or again&s;t the rights and privileges of the Peers, by the late Hou&s;e of Commons, in any of their addre&s;&s;es, votes, or re&s;olutions: Neither do we know of any proceeding by bill, in which it was propo&s;ed to abridge the extent of his Royal Preroga|tive: But, if &s;uch provi&s;ion had exi&s;ted in any bill, we prote&s;t, and we declare, again&s;t all Speeches, Acts or Addre&s;&s;es, from any per&s;ons what&s;oever, which have a tendency to con&s;ider &s;uch bills, or

the per&s;ons concerned in them, as ju&s;t objects of any kind of cen&s;ure and puni&s;hment from the Throne. Nece&s;&s;ary reformations may hereafter require, as they have frequently done in former times, limitations, and abridgments, and in &s;ome ca&s;es an entire extinction of &s;ome branch of prerogative. If bills &s;hould be improper in the form in which they appear in the Hou&s;e where they originate, they are liable, by the wi&s;dom of this Con&s;titution, to be corrected, and even to be totally &s;et a&s;ide, el&s;ewhere. This is the known, the legal, and the &s;afe remedy: But whatever, by the manife&s;tation of the Royal di&s;plea&s;ure, tends to intimidate individual Members from propo&s;ing, or this Hou&s;e from receiving, debating, and pa&s;&s;ing bills, tends to prevent even the beginning of every reformation in the State; and utterly de&s;troys the deliberative capacity of Parliament.&mdash;We therefore claim, demand, and in&s;i&s;t upon it, as our undoubted right, that no per&s;ons &s;hall be deemed proper objects of animadver|&s;ion by the Crown, in any mode whatever, for the votes which they give, or the propo&s;itions which they make, in Parliament.</P>

This Hou&s;e is a&s;&s;ured, that our humble advice on the exerci&s;e of prerogative will be heard with the &s;ame attention with which it has ever been regarded; and that it will be followed by the &s;ame effects which it has ever produced, during the happy and glorious Reigns of his Maje&s;ty's Royal Progenitors; not doubt|ing but that, in all tho&s;e points, we &s;hall be con&s;idered as a Council of wi&s;dom and weight to advi&s;e, and not merely as an accu&s;er of competence to criminate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline">"I ob&s;erve at the &s;ame time, that there is <HI>no charge or complaint</HI> &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t my pre&s;ent Mini&s;ters;"</Q>&mdash;<BIBL><HI>The King's an&s;wer,</HI> 25th <HI>February,</HI> 1784, <HI>to the Addre&s;s of the Hou&s;e of Commons.</HI> Vide, <HI>Re&s;olutions of the Hou&s;e of Commons, Printed for Debrett, P.</HI> 31</BIBL></NOTE>.

and we tru&s;t that we &s;hall be left to our free di&s;cretion which of them we &s;hall employ as be&s;t calculated for his Maje&s;ty's, and the Na|tional &s;ervice&mdash;Whenever we &s;hall &s;ee it expedient to offer our advice concerning his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervants, who are tho&s;e of the public, we confidently hope, that the per&s;onal favour of any Mini&s;ter, or any &s;et of Mini&s;ters, will not be more dear to his Maje&s;ty, than the credit and character of an Hou&s;e of Commons. It is an experiment full of peril to put the repre&s;entative wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice of his Maje&s;ty's people in the wrong; it is a crooked and de&s;perate de&s;ign, leading to mi&s;chief, the extent of which no human wi&s;dom can fore&s;ee, to attempt to form a prerogative party in the nation, to be re&s;orted to as occa&s;ion &s;hall require, in derogation from the authority of the Com|mons of Great-Britain in Parliament a&s;&s;embled: It is a contrivance full of danger, for Mini&s;ters to &s;et up the repre&s;entative and con&s;tituent bodies of the Commons of this kingdom as two &s;eparate and di&s;tinct powers, formed to counterpoi&s;e each other, leaving the preference in the hands of &s;ecret advi&s;ers of the Crown. In &s;uch a &s;ituation of things, the&s;e advi&s;ers, taking advantage of the dif|ferences which may accidentally ari&s;e, or may purpo&s;ely be foment|ed between them, will have it in their choice to re&s;ort to the one or the other, as may be&s;t &s;uit the purpo&s;es of their fini&s;ter ambition. By exciting an emulation and conte&s;t between the repre&s;entative and con&s;tituent bodies, as parties contending for credit and influence at the Throne, Sacrifices will be made by both; and the whole can end in nothing el&s;e than the de&s;truction of the deare&s;t rights and liberties of the nation. If there mu&s;t be another mode of conveying the collective &s;en&s;e of the people to the Throne than that by the Hou&s;e of Commons, it ought to be fixed and defined, and its autho|rity ought to be &s;ettled: It ought not to exi&s;t in &s;o precarious and dependent a &s;tate as that Mini&s;ters &s;hould have it in their power, at their own mere plea&s;ure, to acknowledge it with re&s;pect, or to reject it with &s;corn.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="16">
It is the undoubted prerogative of the Crown to di&s;&s;olve Parlia|ment; but we beg leave to lay before his Maje&s;ty, that it is, of all the tru&s;ts ve&s;ted in his Maje&s;ty, the mo&s;t critical and delicate, and that in which this Hou&s;e has the mo&s;t rea&s;on to require, not only the good faith, but the favour of the Crown. His Commons are not always upon a par with his Mini&s;ters in an application to popu|lar judgment: It is not in the power of the members of this Hou&s;e to go to their election at the moment the mo&s;t favourable for them. It is in the power of the Crown to choo&s;e a time for their di&s;&s;olu|lution whil&s;t great and arduous matters of &s;tate and legi&s;lation are depending, which may be ea&s;ily mi&s;under&s;tood, and which cannot be fully explained before that mi&s;under&s;tanding may prove fatal to the honour that belongs, and to the con&s;ideration that is due, to Members of Parliament.</P>
<P>With his Maje&s;ty is the gift of all the rewards, the honours, di&s;|tinctions, favour, and graces of the &s;tate; with his Maje&s;ty is the mitigation of all the rigours of the law; and we rejoice to &s;ee the Crown po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tru&s;ts calculated to obtain good-will, and charged with duties which are popular and plea&s;ing. Our tru&s;ts are of a different kind. Our duties are har&s;h and invidious in their nature; and ju&s;tice and &s;afety is all we can expect in the exerci&s;e of them. We are to offer &s;alutary, which is not always plea&s;ing, council: We are to enquire and to accu&s;e: And the objects of our enquiry and charge will be for the mo&s;t part per&s;ons of wealth, power, and ex|ten&s;ive connections: We are to make rigid laws for the pre&s;ervation of revenue, which of nece&s;&s;ity more or le&s;s confine &s;ome action, or re&s;train &s;ome function, which before was free: What is the mo&s;t critical and invidious of all, the whole body of the public impo&s;i|tions originate from us, and the hand of the Hou&s;e of Commons is &s;een and felt in every burthen that pre&s;&s;es on the people. Whil&s;t,
<PB N="12" REF="17">
ultimately, we are &s;erving them, and in the fir&s;t in&s;tance whil&s;t we are &s;erving his Maje&s;ty, it will be hard, indeed, if we &s;hould &s;ee a Hou&s;e of Commons the victim of its zeal and fidelity, &s;acrificed by his Mini&s;ters to tho&s;e very popular di&s;contents which &s;hall be ex|cited by our dutiful endeavours for the &s;ecurity and greatne&s;s of his Throne. No other con&s;equence can re&s;ult from &s;uch an example, but that, in future, the Hou&s;e of Commons, con&s;ulting its &s;afety at the expence of its duties, and &s;uffering the whole energy of the State to be relaxed, will &s;hrink from every &s;ervice, which, how|ever nece&s;&s;ary, is of a great and arduous nature, or that, willing to provide for the public nece&s;&s;ities, and, at the &s;ame time, to &s;ecure the means of performing that ta&s;k, they will exchange independence for protection, and will court a &s;ub&s;ervient exi&s;tence through the favour of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters of State, or tho&s;e Secret Advi&s;ers, who ought them&s;elves to &s;tand in awe of the Commons of this realm.</P>
<P>An Hou&s;e of Commons, re&s;pected by his Mini&s;ters, is e&s;&s;ential to his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice: It is fit that they &s;hould yield to Parliament, and not that Parliament &s;hould be broken and new modelled until it is fitted to their purpo&s;es. If our authority is only to be held up when we coincide in opinion with his Maje&s;ty's Advi&s;ers, but is to be &s;et at nought the moment it differs from them, the Hou&s;e of Commons will &s;ink into a mere appendage of Admini&s;tration; and will lo&s;e that independent character which, in&s;eparably connecting the honour and reputation with the acts of this Hou&s;e, enables us to afford a real, effective, and &s;ub&s;tantial &s;upport to his government, It is the deference &s;hewn to our opinion, when we di&s;&s;ent from the &s;ervants of the Crown, which alone can give authority to the pro|ceedings of this Hou&s;e, when it concurs with their mea&s;ures.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="18">
That authority once lo&s;t, the credit of his Maje&s;ty's Crown will be impaired in the eyes of all nations. Foreign powers, who may yet wi&s;h to revive a friendly intercour&s;e with this nation, will look in vain for that hold which gave a connection with Great-Britain the preference to an alliance with any other State. An Hou&s;e of Commons, of which Mini&s;ters were known to &s;tand in awe, where every thing was nece&s;&s;arily di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, on principles fit to be openly and publicly avowed, and which could not be retracted or varied without danger, furni&s;hed a ground of confidence in the public faith, which the engagement of no State dependent on the fluctuation of per&s;onal favour, and private advice, can ever pretend to. If faith with the Hou&s;e of Commons, the grand &s;ecurity for the national faith it&s;elf, can be broken with impunity, a wound is given to the political importance of Great Britain, which will not ea&s;ily be healed.</P>
<P>That there was a great variance between the late Hou&s;e of Com|mons and certain per&s;ons, whom his Maje&s;ty has been advi&s;ed to make and continue as Mini&s;ters, in defiance of the advice of that Hou&s;e, is notorious to the world. That Hou&s;e did not confide in tho&s;e Mini&s;ters; and they with-held their confidence from them for rea&s;ons for which po&s;terity will honour and re&s;pect the names of tho&s;e who compo&s;ed that Hou&s;e of Commons, di&s;tingui&s;hed for its independence. They could not confide in per&s;ons who have &s;hewn a di&s;po&s;ition to dark and dangerous intrigues. By the&s;e intrigues they have weakened, if not de&s;troyed, the clear a&s;&s;urance which his Maje&s;ty's people, and which all nations ought to have, of what are, and what are not, the real acts of his government.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;een that his Mini&s;ters may continue in their offices, without any &s;ignification to them of his Maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure
<PB N="14" REF="19">
at any of their mea&s;ures, whil&s;t per&s;ons con&s;iderable for their rank, and known to have had acce&s;s to his Maje&s;ty's &s;acred per&s;on, can, with impunity, abu&s;e that advantage, and employ his Maje&s;ty's name to di&s;avow and counteract the proceedings of his official &s;er|vants, nothing but di&s;tru&s;t, di&s;cord, debility, contempt of all autho|rity, and general confu&s;ion, can prevail in his government.</P>
<P>This we lay before his Maje&s;ty, with humility and concern, as the inevitable effect of a &s;pirit of intrigue in his executive govern|ment; an evil which we have but too much rea&s;on to be per&s;uaded exi&s;ts and increa&s;es. During the cour&s;e of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion it broke out in a manner the mo&s;t alarming. This evil was infinitely aggra|vated by the unauthorized, but not di&s;avowed u&s;e which has been made of his Maje&s;ty's name, for the purpo&s;e of the mo&s;t uncon&s;ti|tutional, corrupt, and di&s;honourable influence on the minds of the Members of Parliament, that ever was practi&s;ed in this kingdom. No attention, even to the exterior decorum, in the practice of cor|ruption, and intimidation employed on Peers, was ob&s;erved: Several Peers were obliged under menaces to retract their declarations, and to recall their proxies.</P>
<P>The Commons have the deepe&s;t intere&s;t in the purity and inte|grity of the Peerage. The Peers di&s;po&s;e of all the property in the kingdom, in the la&s;t re&s;ort; and they di&s;po&s;e of it on their honour and not on their oaths, as all the members of every other tribunal in the kingdom mu&s;t do; though in them the proceeding is not conclu&s;ive. We have, therefore, a right to demand that no appli|cation &s;hall be made to Peers of &s;uch a nature as may give room to call in que&s;tion, much le&s;s to attaint, our &s;ole &s;ecurity for all that we po&s;&s;e&s;s. This corrupt proceeding appeared to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, who are the natural guardians of the purity of Parliament,
<PB N="15" REF="20">
and of the purity of every branch of judicature, a mo&s;t reprehen&s;ible and dangerous practice, tending to &s;hake the very foundation of the authority of the Hou&s;e of Peers;&mdash;and they branded it as &s;uch by their re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e had not &s;ufficient evidence to enable them legally to puni&s;h this practice, but they had enough to caution them again&s;t all confidence in the authors and abettors of it. They performed their duty in humbly advi&s;ing his Maje&s;ty again&s;t the employment of &s;uch Mini&s;ters; but his Maje&s;ty was advi&s;ed to keep tho&s;e Mini&s;ters, and to di&s;&s;olve that Parliament. The Hou&s;e, aware of the importance and urgency of its duty with regard to the Briti&s;h intere&s;ts in India, which were and are in the utmo&s;t di&s;order, and in the utmo&s;t peril, mo&s;t humbly reque&s;ted his Maje&s;ty not to di&s;|&s;olve the Parliament during the cour&s;e of their very critical pro|ceedings on that &s;ubject. His Maje&s;ty's gracious conde&s;cen&s;ion to that reque&s;t was conveyed in the Royal faith, pledged to an Hou&s;e of Parliament, and &s;olemnly delivered from the throne. It was but a very few days after a committee had been, with the con&s;ent and concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, appointed for an enquiry into certain accounts delivered to the Hou&s;e by the Court of Directors, and then actually engaged in that enquiry, that the Mini&s;ters, regardle&s;s of the a&s;&s;urance given from the Crown to an Hou&s;e of Commons, did di&s;&s;olve that Parliament. We mo&s;t humbly &s;ubmit to his Maje&s;ty's con&s;ideration the con&s;equences of this their breach of public faith.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, under that &s;ecurity, were engaged in his Maje&s;ty's and the national bu&s;ine&s;s, endeavours were indu&s;triou&s;ly u&s;ed to calumniate tho&s;e whom it was found impracticable to corrupt. The reputation of the Members,
<PB N="16" REF="21">
and the reputation of the Hou&s;e it&s;elf, was undermined in every part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>In the Speech from the Throne relative to India, we are cautioned by the Mini&s;ters, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not to lo&s;e &s;ight of the effect any mea&s;ure may have on the con&s;titution of our country."</Q> We are apprehen&s;ive that a calumnious report &s;pread abroad of an attack upon his Maje&s;ty's prerogative by the late Hou&s;e of Commons, may have made an impre&s;&s;ion on his Royal mind, and have given occa&s;ion to this unu&s;ual admonition to the pre&s;ent. This attack is charged to have been made in the late Parliament, by a bill which pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Commons in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of that Parliament, for the regu|lation of the affairs, for the pre&s;ervation of the commerce, and for the amendment of the government of this nation, in the Ea&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>That his Maje&s;ty and his people may have an opportunity of entering into the ground of this injurious charge, we beg leave humbly to acquaint his Maje&s;ty, that, far from having made any infringement what&s;oever on any part of his Royal prerogative, that bill did, for a limited time, give to his Maje&s;ty certain powers never before po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Crown; and for this his pre&s;ent Mini&s;ters (who, rather than fall &s;hort in the number of their calumnies, employ &s;ome that are contradictory) have &s;landered this Hou&s;e, as aiming at the exten&s;ion of an uncon&s;titutional influence in his Maje&s;ty's Crown. This pretended attempt to increa&s;e the influence of the Crown, they were weak enough to endeavour to per&s;uade his Maje&s;ty's people was among&s;t the cau&s;es which excited his Maje&s;ty's re&s;entment again&s;t his late Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="22">
Further, to remove the impre&s;&s;ions of this calumny concerning an attempt in the Hou&s;e of Commons again&s;t his prerogative, it is proper to inform his Maje&s;ty, that the territorial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Ea&s;t Indies never have been declared, by any public judgment, act, or in&s;trument, or any re&s;olution of Parliament what&s;oever, to be the &s;ubject matter of his Maje&s;ty's prerogative; nor have they ever been under&s;tood as belonging to his ordinary admini&s;tration, or to be annexed or united to his Crown; but that they are acqui&s;ition of a new and peculiar de&s;cription<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The territorial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Ea&s;t Indies were acquired to the Company, in virtue of grants from the Great Mogul, in the nature of offices and juri&s;dictions, to be held under <HI>him,</HI> and dependent upon <HI>his</HI> Crown; with the expre&s;s condition of being obedient to orders from <HI>his</HI> Court, and of paying an annual tribute to <HI>his</HI> trea&s;ury. It is true, that no obedience is yielded to the&s;e orders; and for &s;ome time pa&s;t there has been no payment made of this tribute. But it is under a grant, &s;o conditioned, that they &s;till hold. To &s;ubject the King of Great Britain as tributary to a foreign power, by the acts of his &s;ubjects&mdash;to &s;uppo&s;e the grant valid, and yet the condition void&mdash;to &s;uppo&s;e it good for the King, and in&s;ufficient for the Company&mdash;to &s;uppo&s;e it an intere&s;t divi&s;ible between the parties.&mdash;The&s;e are &s;ome few of the many legal difficulties to be &s;urmounted, before the common law of England can acknowledge the Ea&s;t India Company's A&s;iatic affairs to be a &s;ubject matter of <HI>prerogative,</HI> as to bring it within the verge of Engli&s;h juri&s;prudence. It is a very anomalous &s;pecies of power and property which is held by the Ea&s;t India Com|pany. Our Engli&s;h prerogative law does not furni&s;h principles, much le&s;s precedents by which it can be defined or adju&s;ted. Nothing but the eminent dominion of Parliament over every Briti&s;h &s;ubject in every concern, and in every circum&s;tance in which he is placed, can adju&s;t this new intricate matter. Parliament may act wi&s;ely or unwi&s;ely; ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly; but Parliament alone is competent to it.</NOTE>, unknown to the ancient executive con&s;titution of this country.</P>
<P>From time to time, therefore, Parliament provided for their government according to its di&s;cretion, and to its opinion of what was required by the public nece&s;&s;ities. We do not know that his
<PB N="18" REF="23">
Maje&s;ty was entitled, by prerogative, to exerci&s;e any act of autho|rity what&s;oever in the Company's affairs, or that, in effect, &s;uch authority ever has been exerci&s;ed. His Maje&s;ty's patronage was not taken away by that bill; becau&s;e it is notorious that his Maje&s;ty never originally had the appointment of a &s;ingle officer, civil or military, in the Company's e&s;tabli&s;hment in India; nor has the lea&s;t degree of patronage ever been acquired to the Crown in any other manner or mea&s;ure, than as the power was thought expedient to be granted by act of Parliament; that is, by the very &s;ame authority by which the offices were di&s;po&s;ed of and regulated in the bill, which his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervants have fal&s;ely and injuriou&s;ly repre&s;ented as infringing upon the prerogative of the Crown.</P>
<P>Before the year 1773 the whole Admini&s;tration of India, and the whole patronage to office there, was in the hands of the Ea&s;t India Company. The Ea&s;t-India Company is not a branch of his Ma|je&s;ty's Prerogative Admini&s;tration, nor does that body exerci&s;e any &s;pecies of authority under it, nor indeed from any Briti&s;h title, that does not derive all its legal validity from Acts of Parliament.</P>
<P>When a claim was a&s;&s;erted to the India territorial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the occupation of the Company, the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were not claimed as parcel of his Maje&s;ty's patrimonial e&s;tate, or as a fruit of the ancient inheritance of his Crown. They were claimed for the public. And when agreements were made with the Ea&s;t-India Company concern|ing any compo&s;ition for the holding, or any participation of the profits of tho&s;e territories, the agreement was made with the public, and the preambles of the &s;everal acts have uniformly &s;o &s;tated it. The&s;e agreements were not made (even nominally) with his Maje&s;ty but with Parliament; and the bills making and e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch agreements always originated in this Hou&s;e, which appropriated the
<PB N="19" REF="24">
money to await the di&s;po&s;ition of Parliament, without the ceremony of previous con&s;ent from the Crown even &s;o much as &s;ugge&s;ted by any of his Mini&s;ters; which previous con&s;ent is an ob&s;ervance of decorum, not indeed of &s;trict right, but generally paid when a new appropria|tion takes place in any part of his Maje&s;ty's prerogative revenues.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of a right thus uniformly recognized, and uniformly acted on, when Parliament undertook the reformation of the Ea&s;t-India Company in 1773, a commi&s;&s;ion was appointed as the com|mi&s;&s;ion in the late bill was appointed; and it was made to continue for a term of years, as the commi&s;&s;ion in the late bill was to con|tinue; all the Commi&s;&s;ioners were named in Parliament, as in the late bill they were named. As they received, &s;o they held their offices, wholly independent of the Crown; they held them for a fixed term; they were not removeable by an Addre&s;s of either Hou&s;e, or even of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, a precaution ob|&s;erved in the late bill, relative to the Commi&s;&s;ioners propo&s;ed therein; nor were they bound by the &s;trict rules of pro|ceeding which regulated and re&s;trained the late Commi&s;&s;ioners again&s;t all po&s;&s;ible abu&s;e of a power, which could not fail of being diligently and zealou&s;ly watched by the Mini&s;ters of the Crown, and the Proprietors of the Stock, as well as by Parliament. Their pro|ceedings were, in that bill, directed to be of &s;uch a nature as ea&s;ily to &s;ubject them to the &s;tricte&s;t revi&s;ion of both, in ca&s;e of any mal|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>In the year 1780, an Act of Parliament again made provi&s;ion for the Government of tho&s;e territories for another four years, without any &s;ort of reference to prerogative; nor was the lea&s;t objection taken at the &s;econd, more than at the fir&s;t of tho&s;e periods, as if an

infringement had been made upon the rights of the Crown; yet his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters have thought fit to repre&s;ent the late com|mi&s;&s;ion as an entire innovation on the Con&s;titution, and the &s;etting|up a new order and e&s;tate in the nation, tending to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the monarchy it&s;elf.</P>
<P>If the Government of the Ea&s;t-Indies, other than by his Ma|je&s;ty's prerogative, be, in effect, a fourth Order in the Common|wealth, this Order has long exi&s;ted; becau&s;e the Ea&s;t-India Com|pany has for many years enjoyed it in the fulle&s;t extent, and does at this day enjoy the whole admini&s;tration of tho&s;e provinces, and the patronage to offices throughout that great empire, except as it is controuled by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>It was the ill condition, and ill Admini&s;tration of the Company's affairs, which induced this Hou&s;e (merely as a temporary e&s;tabli&s;h|ment) to ve&s;t the &s;ame powers which the Company did before po&s;&s;e&s;s, (and no other) for a limited time, and under very &s;trict directions, in proper hands, until they could be re&s;tored, or further provi&s;ion made concerning them. It was therefore no creation whatever of a new power, but the removal of an old power, long &s;ince created, and then exi&s;ting, from the management of tho&s;e per&s;ons who had manife&s;tly and dangerou&s;ly abu&s;ed their tru&s;t. This Hou&s;e, which well knows the Parliamentary Origin of all the Company's powers and privileges, and is not ignorant or negligent of the authority which may ve&s;t tho&s;e powers and privileges in others, if ju&s;tice and the public &s;afety &s;o require, is con&s;cious to it&s;elf, that it no more creates a new Order in the &s;tate, by making occa&s;ional Tru&s;tees for the direction of the Company, than it originally did in giving a much more permanent tru&s;t to the Directors, or to the General Court of that Body. The monopoly of the Ea&s;t-India Company was a dero|gation
<PB N="21" REF="26">
from the general freedom of trade belonging to his Maje&s;ty's people. The powers of Government, and of peace and war, are parts of Prerogative of the highe&s;t order. Of our competence to re&s;train the rights of all his &s;ubjects by Act of Parliament, and to ve&s;t tho&s;e high and eminent Prerogatives even in a particular Company of Merchants, there has been no que&s;tion. We beg leave mo&s;t humbly to claim as our right, and as a right which this Hou&s;e has always u&s;ed, to frame &s;uch bills, for the regulation of that commerce, and of the territories held by the Ea&s;t-India Company, and every thing relating to them, as to our di&s;cretion &s;hall &s;eem fit: and we a&s;&s;ert and maintain, that therein we follow, and do not innovate on the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>That his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, mi&s;led by their ambition, have en|deavoured, if po&s;&s;ible, to form a faction in the country again&s;t the popular part of the con&s;titution; and have therefore thought proper to add to their &s;landerous accu&s;ation again&s;t a Hou&s;e of Parliament, relative to his Maje&s;ty's prerogative, another of a different nature, calculated for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing fears and jealou&s;ies among the corporate bodies of the kingdom, and of per&s;uading uninformed per&s;ons belonging to tho&s;e corporations to look to, and to make Addre&s;&s;es to them as protectors of their rights, under their &s;everal Charters, from the de&s;igns which they, without any ground, charged the then Hou&s;e of Commons to have formed again&s;t <HI>Charters in general.</HI> For this purpo&s;e they have not &s;crupled to a&s;&s;ert, that the exertion of his Maje&s;ty's prerogative in the late precipitate change in his Admini&s;tration, and the di&s;&s;olution of the late Parliament, were mea&s;ures adopted in order to re&s;cue the people and their rights out of the hands of the Hou&s;e of Commons, their Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="27">
We tru&s;t that his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects are not yet &s;o far deluded as to believe that the Charters, or that any other of their local or general privileges can have a &s;olid &s;ecurity in any place but where that &s;ecurity has always been looked for, and always found, in the Hou&s;e of Commons. Mi&s;erable and precarious indeed would be the &s;tate of their franchi&s;es, if they were to find no defence but from that quarter from whence they have always been attacked<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The attempt upon charters and the privileges of the corporate bodies of the kingdom in the reigns of Charles the Second, and James the Second, was made by the <HI>Crown.</HI> It was carried on by the ordinary cour&s;e of law, in the courts in&s;tituted for the &s;ecurity of the property and franchi&s;es of the people. This attempt made by the <HI>Crown,</HI> was at|tended with complete &s;ucce&s;s. The corporate rights of the city of London, and of all the companies it contains, were by &s;olemn judgment of law declared forfeited, and all their franchi&s;es, privileges, properties and e&s;tates, were of cour&s;e &s;eized into the hands of the <HI>Crown.</HI> The injury was from the Crown; the redre&s;s was by Parliament. A bill was brought into the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> by which the judgment again&s;t the city of London, and again&s;t the companies was rever&s;ed; and this bill pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Lords without any complaint of a tre&s;pa&s;s on their juri&s;diction, although the bill was for a rever&s;al of a judgment in law. By this act, which is in the &s;econd of William and Mary, chap. 8, the que&s;tion of forfeiture of that charter is for ever taken out of the power of any court of law. No cognizance can be taken of it except in Parliament.</P>
<P>Although the act abovementioned has declared the judgment again&s;t the corporation of London to be <HI>illegal;</HI> yet Black&s;tone makes no &s;cruple of a&s;&s;erting, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"perhaps in &s;trictne&s;s of law, the proceedings in mo&s;t of them [the Quo Warranto cau&s;es] were &s;ufficiently regular,"</Q> leaving it in doubt, whether this regularity did not apply to the cor|poration of London, as well as to any of the re&s;t; and he &s;eems to blame the proceeding (as mo&s;t blameable it was) not &s;o much on account of illegality, as for the Crown's having employed a legal proceeding for political purpo&s;es. He calls it <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an exertion of <HI>an act of law</HI> for the purpo&s;es of the State."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;ecurity which was given to the city of London, would have been extended to all the corporations, if the Hou&s;e of Commons could have prevailed. But the bill for that purpo&s;e pa&s;&s;ed but by a majority of one in the Lords; and it was entirely lo&s;t by a prorogation, which is the act of the Crown. Small, indeed, was the &s;ecurity which the corporation of London enjoyed, before the act of William and Mary, and which all the other corporations &s;ecured by no &s;tatute, enjoy at this hour, if &s;trict law was employed again&s;t them. The u&s;e of that &s;trict law has been always ren|dered very delicate by the &s;ame means, by which the almo&s;t unmea&s;ured legal powers re&s;iding, (and in many in&s;tances dangerou&s;ly re&s;iding in the Crown) are kept within due bounds; I mean, that &s;trong &s;uperintending power in the Hou&s;e of Commons, which incon&s;iderate people have been prevailed on to condemn as trenching on prerogative. Strict law is by no means &s;uch a friend to the rights of the &s;ubject, as they have been taught to believe. They who have been mo&s;t conver&s;ant in this kind of learning will be mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the danger of &s;ubmitting corporate rights of high political importance to the&s;e &s;ubordinate tribunals. The general heads of law on that &s;ubject are vulgar and trivial. On them there is not much que&s;tion. But it is far from ea&s;y to determine what &s;pecial acts, or what &s;pecial neglects of action &s;hall &s;ubject corporations to a forfeiture. There is &s;o much laxity in this doctrine, that great room is left for favour or prejudice, which might give to the Crown an entire dominion over tho&s;e corporations. On the other hand, it is undoubtedly true, that every &s;ubordinate corporate right ought to be &s;ubject to control; to &s;uperior direction; and even to forfeiture upon ju&s;t cau&s;e. In this rea&s;on and law agree. In every judgment given on a corporate right of great political importance, the policy and prudence make no &s;mall part of the que&s;tion. To the&s;e con&s;iderations a court of law is not competent; and indeed an attempt at the lea&s;t intermixture of &s;uch ideas with the matter of law, could have no other effect, than wholly to corrupt the judicial character of the court, in which &s;uch a cau&s;e &s;hould come to be tried. It is be&s;ides to be remarked, that if in virtue of a legal proce&s;s a forfeiture &s;hould be adjudged, the court of law has no power to modify or mitigate. The whole franchi&s;e is annihilated, and the corporate property goes into the hands of the Crown. They who hold the new doctrines concerning the power of the Hou&s;e of Commons, ought well to con&s;ider in &s;uch a ca&s;e by what means the corporate rights could be revived, or the property could be recovered out of the hands of the Crown. But Parliament can do, what the courts neither can do nor ought to attempt. Parliament is competent to give due weight to all political con&s;iderations. It may modify; it may mitigate; and it may render perfectly &s;ecure all that it does not think fit to take away. It is not likely that Parliament will ever draw to it&s;elf the cog|nizance of que&s;tions concerning ordinary corporations, farther than to protect them in ca&s;e attempts are made to induce a forfeiture of their franchi&s;es.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of the Ea&s;t India Company is different even from that of the greate&s;t of the&s;e corporations. No monopoly of trade, beyond their own limits, is ve&s;ted in the corporate body of any town or city in the Kingdom. Even within the&s;e limits the monopoly is not general. This Company has the monopoly of the trade of half the world. The fir&s;t corporation of the kingdom, has for the object of its juri&s;diction only a few matters of &s;ubordinate police. The Ea&s;t-India Company governs an empire through all its con|cerns, and all its departments, from the lowe&s;t office of economy to the highe&s;t councils of &s;tate,&mdash;an empire to which Great-Britain is in compari&s;on but a re&s;pectable province To leave the&s;e concerns without &s;uperior cognizance would be madne&s;s; to leave them to be judged in the courts below on the principles of a confined juri&s;prudence, would be folly. It is well if the whole Legi&s;lative Power is competent to the correction of abu&s;es, which are commen&s;urate to the immen&s;ity of the object they affect. The idea of an ab&s;olute power has indeed its terrors; but that objection lies to every parliamentary proceeding; and as no other can regulate the abu&s;es of &s;uch a Charter, it is fitte&s;t that &s;overeign authority &s;hould be exerci&s;ed, where it is mo&s;t likely to be attended with the mo&s;t effectual correctives. The&s;e correctives are furni&s;hed by the nature and cour&s;e of Parlia|mentary proceedings, and by the infinitely diver&s;ified characters who compo&s;e the two Hou&s;es. In effect and virtually they form a va&s;t number, variety, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of judges and jurors. There the fulne&s;s, the freedom, and publicity of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, leaves it ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h what are acts of power, and what the determinations of equity and rea&s;on. There prejudice corrects prejudice, and the different a&s;perities of party zeal mitigate and neutralize each other. So far from violence being the general characteri&s;tick of the proceedings of Parliament, whatever the beginnings of any Parliamentary proce&s;s may be, its general fault in the end is, that it is found incomplete and ineffectual.</P></NOTE>. But the
<PB N="23" REF="28">

frequently attacked, and will attack (and they tru&s;t, in the end, with their wonted &s;ucce&s;s) that is, upon tho&s;e which are corruptly and oppre&s;&s;ively admini&s;tered; and this Hou&s;e do faithfully a&s;&s;ure his Maje&s;ty, that we will correct, and, if nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e, as far as in us lies, will wholly de&s;troy every &s;pecies of power and authority exerci&s;ed by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to the oppre&s;&s;ion, wrong, and detriment of the people, and to the impoveri&s;hment and de&s;olation of the countries &s;ubject to it.</P>
<P>The propagators of the calumnies again&s;t that Hou&s;e of Parlia|ment have been indefatigable in exaggerating the &s;uppo&s;ed injury
<PB N="25" REF="30">
done to the Ea&s;t-India Company by the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the authorities which they have, in every in&s;tance, abu&s;ed; as if power had been wre&s;ted, by wrong and violence, from ju&s;t and prudent hands; but they have, with equal care, concealed the weighty grounds and rea&s;ons on which that Hou&s;e had adopted the mo&s;t moderate of all po&s;&s;ible expedients for re&s;cuing the natives of India from oppre&s;&s;ion, and for &s;aving the intere&s;ts of the real and hone&s;t Proprietors of their Stock, as well as that great national, commercial concern, from imminent ruin.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters afore&s;aid have al&s;o cau&s;ed it to be reported, that the Hou&s;e of Commons have confi&s;cated the property of the Ea&s;t-India Company. It is the rever&s;e of truth. The whole management was a tru&s;t for the Proprietors, under their own in&s;pection (and it was &s;o provided for in the bill) and under the in&s;pection of Parliament. That bill, &s;o far from confi&s;cating the Company's property, was the only one which, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, did not, in &s;ome &s;hape or other, affect their property, or re&s;train them in the di&s;po&s;ition of it.</P>
<P>It is proper that his Maje&s;ty and all his people &s;hould be in|formed, that the Hou&s;e of Commons have proceeded, with regard to the Ea&s;t-India Company, with a degree of care, circum&s;pection, and deliberation, which has not been equalled in the hi&s;tory of Par|liamentary proceedings. For &s;ixteen years the &s;tate and condition of that body has never been wholly out of their view: In the year 1767 the Hou&s;e took tho&s;e objects into con&s;ideration, in a Commit|tee of the whole Hou&s;e: The bu&s;ine&s;s was pur&s;ued in the following year: In the year 1772, two Committees were appointed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which examined into their affairs with much diligence, and made very ample Reports: In the year 1773, the proceedings
<PB N="26" REF="31">
were carried to an Act of Parliament, which proved ineffectual to its purpo&s;e; the oppre&s;&s;ions and abu&s;es in India having &s;ince rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed, on account of the greatne&s;s of the temp|tations and convenience of the opportunities, which got the better of the Legi&s;lative provi&s;ions calculated again&s;t ill practices, then in their beginnings: In&s;omuch that, in 1781, two Committees were again in&s;tituted, who have made &s;eventeen reports. It was upon the mo&s;t minute, exact, and laborious collection and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of facts, that the late Hou&s;e of Commons proceeded in the reform which they attempted in the Admini&s;tration of India, but which has been fru&s;trated by ways and means the mo&s;t di&s;honourable to his Maje&s;ty's Government, and the mo&s;t pernicious to the Con&s;titution of this kingdom. His Maje&s;ty was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;orders in the Company's admini&s;tration, that the con&s;ideration of that &s;ubject was no le&s;s than &s;ix times recommended to this Hou&s;e in Speeches from the Throne.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the Parliamentary enquiries has been, that the Ea&s;t-India Company was found totally corrupted, and totally perverted from the purpo&s;es of its in&s;titution, whether political or commer|cial; that the powers of war and peace given by the Charter had been abu&s;ed, by kindling ho&s;tilities in every quarter for the purpo&s;es of rapine; that almo&s;t all the treaties of peace they have made, have only given cau&s;e to &s;o many breaches of public faith; that countries once the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing are reduced to a &s;tate of indigence, decay, and depopulation, to the dimunition of our &s;trength, and to the in|finite di&s;honour of our national character; that the laws of this kingdom are notoriou&s;ly, and almo&s;t in every in&s;tance, de&s;pi&s;ed; that the &s;ervants of the Company, by the purcha&s;e of qualifications to vote in the General Court, and, and at length, by getting the Company it&s;elf deeply in their debt, have obtained the entire and
<PB N="27" REF="32">
ab&s;olute ma&s;tery in the body, by which they ought to have been ruled and coerced. Thus their malver&s;ations in office are &s;upported in&s;tead of being checked by the Company. The whole of the affairs of that body are reduced to a mo&s;t perilous &s;ituation; and many millions of innocent and de&s;erving men who are under the protec|tion of this nation, and who ought to be protected by it, are oppre&s;&s;ed by a mo&s;t de&s;potic and rapacious tyranny. The Company and their Servants having &s;trengthened them&s;elves by this confederacy, have &s;et at defiance the authority and admonitions of this Hou&s;e em|ployed to reform them; and when this Hou&s;e had &s;elected certain principal delinquents, whom they declared it the duty of the Com|pany to recall, the Company held out its legal privileges again&s;t all reformation; po&s;itively refu&s;ed to recall them; and &s;upported tho&s;e who had fallen under the the ju&s;t cen&s;ure of this Hou&s;e, with new and &s;tronger marks of countenance and approbation.</P>
<P>The late Hou&s;e di&s;covering the rever&s;ed &s;ituation of the Company, by which the nominal &s;ervants are really the ma&s;ters, and the offen|ders are become their own judges, thought fit to examine into the &s;tate of their commerce; and they have al&s;o di&s;covered that their commercial affairs are in the greate&s;t di&s;order; that their debts have accumulated beyond any pre&s;ent or obvious future means of payment, at lea&s;t under the actual admini&s;tration of their affairs; that this condition of the Ea&s;t India Company has begun to affect the &s;ink|ing fund it&s;elf, on which the public credit of the kingdom re&s;ts, a million and upwards being due to the Cu&s;toms, which that Hou&s;e of Commons, who&s;e intentions towards the Company have been &s;o gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented, were indulgent enough to re&s;pite. And thus, in&s;tead of confi&s;cating their property, the Company received without intere&s;t (which in &s;uch a ca&s;e had been before charged) the u&s;e of a very large &s;um of the public money. The revenues are under the
<PB N="28" REF="33">
peculiar care of this Hou&s;e, not only as the revenues originate from us, but as, on every failure of the funds &s;et apart for &s;upport of the national credit, or to provide for the national &s;trength and &s;afety, the ta&s;k of &s;upplying every deficiency falls upon his Maje&s;ty's faithful Commons, this Hou&s;e mu&s;t, in effect, tax the people. The Hou&s;e therefore, at every moment, incurs the hazard of becoming ob|noxious to its Con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>The enemies of the late Hou&s;e of Commons re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring on that event. They therefore endeavoured to mi&s;repre&s;ent the provident means adopted by the Hou&s;e of Commons for keeping off this invidious nece&s;&s;ity, as an attack on the rights of the Ea&s;t-India Company; for they well knew, that on the one hand, if, for want of proper regulation and relief, the Company &s;hould become in&s;olvent, or even &s;top payment, the national credit and commerce would &s;u&s;tain an heavy blow; and that calamity would be ju&s;tly im|puted to Parliament, which after &s;uch long enquiries, and &s;uch fre|quent admonitions from his Maje&s;ty, had neglected &s;o e&s;&s;ential and &s;o urgent an article of their duty: On the other hand they knew, that, wholly corrupted as the Company is, nothing effectual could be done to pre&s;erve that intere&s;t from ruin, without taking for a time the national objects of their tru&s;t out of their hands; and then a cry would be indu&s;triou&s;ly rai&s;ed again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Commons, as depriving Briti&s;h Subjects of their legal privileges. The re&s;traint, being plain and &s;imple, mu&s;t be ea&s;ily under&s;tood by tho&s;e who would be brought with great difficulty, to comprehend the intricate detail of matters of fact, which rendered this &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the admini&s;tra|tion of India ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary on motives of ju&s;tice, of policy, of public honour, and public &s;afety.</P>

The Hou&s;e of Commons had not been able to devi&s;e a method, by which the redre&s;s of grievances could be effected through the Au|thors of tho&s;e grievances; nor could they imagine how corruptions could be purified by the corruptors and the corrupted; nor do we now conceive, how any reformation can proceed from the known abettors and &s;upporters of the per&s;ons who have been guilty of the mi&s;demeanors which Parliament has reprobated, and who for their own ill purpo&s;es have given countenance to a fal&s;e and delu&s;ive &s;tate of the Company's affairs, fabricated to mi&s;lead Parliament, and to impo&s;e upon the nation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The purpo&s;e of the mi&s;repre&s;entation being now completely an&s;wered, there is no doubt but the Committee in this Parliament, appointed by the Mini&s;ters them&s;elves, will ju&s;tify, the grounds upon which the la&s;t Parliament proceeded; and will lay open to the world, the dreadful &s;tate of the Company's affairs, and the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of their own calumnies upon this head.

<ITEM>AN ENQUIRY into the ORIGIN and MANNER of CREATING PEERS, by RICHARD WEST, E&s;q. Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Price 3s. The above intere&s;ting Tract, was quoted and recommended by the EARL of SHELBURNE, in the great Debate in the Hou&s;e of Lords, upon Lord Sackville's Peerage: when adverting to the exerci&s;e of the King's Prerogative in creating Peers, and a po&s;&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity for calling forth the latent Powers of the Hou&s;e, again&s;t extraordinary &s;tretches of the Prerogative; his Lord&s;hip &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"It had been imagined that the Hou&s;e of Peers had it not in their Power to right it&s;elf. The &s;uppo&s;ition was founded in error. Lord Chan|cellor We&s;t, in his Book upon the Peerage, pretty clearly evinced to his mind, that there were latent Powers belonging to the Hou&s;e of Lords, which if called forth by &s;ufficient Occa&s;ion, and duly and &s;piritedly exerci&s;ed, were equal to the Correction of any Abu&s;es of the Prerogative which might be attempted."</Q>&mdash;See the Parliamentary Regi&s;ter, Vol. VIII.
