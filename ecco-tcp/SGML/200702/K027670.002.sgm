<P>I Will not &s;end your lady&s;hip the trifles you bid me purcha&s;e without a line.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day, Eleven o'Clock&mdash;Night.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TWAS for all the world like a cut acro&s;s my finger with a &s;harp pen|knife.&mdash;I &s;aw the blood&mdash;gave it a &s;uck&mdash;wrapt it up&mdash;and thought no more about it.</P>
<P>But there is more goes to the heal|ing of a wound than this comes to:&mdash;a wound (unle&s;s 'tis a wound not worth talking of, but by the bye mine is) mu&s;t give you &s;ome pain after.&mdash;Nature will take her own way with it&mdash;it mu&s;t ferment&mdash;it mu&s;t dige&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="190">The &s;tory you told me of Tri&s;tram's pretended tutor, this morning&mdash;My letter by right &s;hould have &s;et out with this &s;entence, and then the &s;imile would not have kept you a moment in &s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P>This vile &s;tory, I &s;ay&mdash;tho' I then &s;aw both how, and where it wounded&mdash;I felt little from it at fir&s;t&mdash;or, to &s;peak more hone&s;tly (tho' it ruins my &s;imile) I felt a great deal of pain from it, but affected an air u&s;ual on &s;uch accidents, of le&s;s feeling than I had.</P>
<P>I have now got home to my lodgings &s;ince the play (you a&s;toni&s;hed me in it) and have been unwrapping this &s;elf|&s;ame wound of mine, and &s;haking my head over it this half hour.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="191">What the devil!&mdash;is there no one learned blockhead throughout the many &s;chools of mi&s;applied &s;cience in the Chri&s;tian World, to make a <HI>tutor</HI> of for my Tri&s;tram?&mdash;<HI>Ex quovis ligno non fit.</HI>&mdash;Are we &s;o run out of &s;tock, that there is no one lumber-headed, muddle-headed, mortar-headed, pud|ding-headed <HI>chap</HI> among&s;t our doc|tors?&mdash;Is there no one &s;ingle wight of much reading and no learning a|mong&s;t the many children in my <HI>mo|ther's</HI> nur&s;ery, who bid high for this charge&mdash;but I mu&s;t di&s;able my judg|ment by choo&s;ing a W&mdash;n? Venge|ance! have I &s;o little concern for the honour of my hero!&mdash;Am I a wretch &s;o void of &s;en&s;e, &s;o bereft of feeling for the figure he is to make in &s;tory,
<PB N="191" REF="192">
that I &s;hould chu&s;e a praeceptor to rob him of all the immortality I intended him? O! dear Mr. G.</P>
<P>Malice is ingenious&mdash;unle&s;s where the exce&s;s of it outwits it&s;elf&mdash;I have two comforts in this &s;troke of it;&mdash;the fir&s;t is, that this one is partly of this kind; and &s;econdly, that it is one of the number of tho&s;e which &s;o unfairly brought poor Yorick to his grave.&mdash;The report might draw blood of the author of Tri&s;tram Shandy&mdash;but could not harm &s;uch a man as the author of the Divine Legation&mdash;God ble&s;s him! though (by the bye, and ac|cording to the natural cour&s;e of de|&s;cents) the ble&s;&s;ing &s;hould come from him to me.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="193">Pray have you no intere&s;t, lateral or collateral, to get me introduced to his Lord&s;hip?</P>
<P>Why do you a&s;k?</P>
<P>My dear Sir, I have no claim to &s;uch an honour, but what ari&s;es from the honour and re&s;pect which in the pro|gre&s;s of my work will be &s;hewn the world I owe to &s;o great a man.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I am talking of owing&mdash;I wi&s;h, my dear Sir, that any body would tell you, how much I am indebted to you.&mdash;I am determined never to do it my&s;elf, or &s;ay more upon the &s;ubject than this, that I am yours,</P>
