<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>BEACONSFIELD, <DATE><HI>Nov.</HI> 1, 1800.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE wi&s;dom, which is canonized by death, is con&s;ulted with a &s;ort of &s;acred veneration. A ca&s;ual remark, or an incidental maxim in &s;ome ancient author, an intere&s;ting narrative, or a pointed anecdote from the hi&s;tory of pa&s;t times, even though they bear but a remote and general application to the exigency of our own immediate &s;ituation, are caught up with eager|ne&s;s, and remembered with delight. But how much more important is the in&s;truction which we may derive from the po&s;thumous opinions of tho&s;e who, having been mo&s;t eminent in our own times for &s;uperior talents and more exten|&s;ive knowledge, have formed their ob&s;ervation on circum&s;tances &s;o &s;imilar to our own, as only not to be the &s;ame, yet who &s;peak without in|fluence from the little prejudices and pa&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
to which accident, folly, or malevolence may have given birth in the pre&s;ent moment.</P>
<P>The late Mr. Burke, in the e&s;timation of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t capable of judging, &s;tood high, both as a &s;cientific and a practical farmer. He carried into his fields the &s;ame penetrating, comprehen&s;ive, and vigorous mind, which &s;hone forth &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly in all his exertions on the &s;tage of public life. Wherever he was, in whatever he was engaged, he was alike a&s;&s;idu|ous in collecting information, and happy in combining, what he acquired, into general prin|ciples. All that the ancients have left us upon hu&s;bandry was familiar to him, and he once en|couraged and &s;et on foot a new edition of tho&s;e valuable writers; but, though he might occa|&s;ionally derive new hints even from tho&s;e &s;ources, he preferred the authority of his own hind to that of He&s;iod or Virgil, of Cato or Columella. He thought for him&s;elf upon this, as upon other &s;ubjects; and not rejecting &s;ound reforms of demon&s;trated errors, he was, how|ever, principally guided by the traditionary &s;kill and experience of that cla&s;s of men, who, from father to &s;on, have for generations laboured in calling forth the fertility of the Engli&s;h &s;oil.
<PB N="v" REF="5">
He not only found in agriculture the mo&s;t agreeable relaxation from his more &s;erious cares, but he regarded the cultivation of the earth, and the improvement of all which it produces, as a &s;ort of moral and religious duty. Towards the clo&s;e of his life, when he had lo&s;t his &s;on, in whom all his pro&s;pects had long centered, after lamenting, in an elegant allu&s;ion to Virgil, that the trees, which he had been nur&s;ing for many years, would now afford no &s;hade to his po&s;terity, he was heard to correct him&s;elf, by adding, "Yet be it &s;o: I ought not therefore to be&s;tow le&s;s attention upon them&mdash;they grow to God."</P>
<P>Agriculture, and the commerce connected with, and dependent upon it, form one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable branches of political economy; and as &s;uch, Mr. Burke diligently &s;tudied them. Indeed, when he began to qualify him&s;elf for the exalted rank which he afterwards held among &s;tate&s;men, he laid a broad and deep foundation; and to an accurate re&s;earch into the con&s;titution, the laws, the civil and military hi&s;tory of the&s;e kingdoms, he joined an enlight|ened acquaintance with the whole circle of our commercial &s;y&s;tem. On his fir&s;t introduction,
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
when a young man, to the late Mr. Gerard Ha|milton, who was then a Lord of Trade, the latter ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed to a friend &s;till liv|ing, how &s;en&s;ibly he felt his own inferiority, much as he had endeavoured to inform him&s;elf, and aided as he was by official documents, in|acce&s;&s;ible to any private per&s;on. He was al&s;o con&s;ulted, and the greate&s;t deference was paid to his opinions by Dr. Adam Smith, in the pro|gre&s;s of the celebrated work on the Wealth of Nations.</P>
<P>In Parliament, Mr. Burke very &s;oon di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf on the&s;e topics. When the fir&s;t great permanent law for regulating our foreign corn-trade was under the con&s;ideration of the Hou&s;e in 1772, he was one of its principle &s;up|porters, in a &s;peech admired at the time for its excellence, and de&s;cribed as abounding with that knowledge in oeconomics, which he was then univer&s;ally allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and illu&s;trated with that philo&s;ophical di&s;crimination, of which he was &s;o peculiarly a ma&s;ter. About the &s;ame time, too, he zealou&s;ly promoted the repeal of the &s;tatutes again&s;t <HI>fore&s;tallers</HI>; a mea&s;ure not lightly and ha&s;tily propo&s;ed or adopted in the liberal impul&s;e of an unguarded moment, but the re&s;ult
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
of various inve&s;tigations made by the Hou&s;e, or in different committees, during &s;ix years of &s;carcity and high prices; a mea&s;ure which, al|though two Bills of a contrary tendency had formerly been introduced and lo&s;t, &s;o approved it&s;elf, at length, to the rea&s;on of all, that it was ordered to be brought in, without a &s;ingle di&s;|&s;entient voice. Yet, though &s;uch was his early pre-eminence in the&s;e pur&s;uits, to the la&s;t hour of his life, as his fame &s;pread wider and wider over Europe, he availed him&s;elf of the ad|vantage which this afforded him, to enlarge the &s;phere of his enquiries into the &s;tate of other countries, that he might benefit his own. The con&s;equence of all was, he every day became more firmly convinced, that the unre&s;trained freedom of buying and &s;elling is the great ani|mating principle of production and &s;upply.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent publication records Mr. Burke's mo&s;t mature reflections on the&s;e intere&s;ting &s;ub|jects; the more valuable, becau&s;e the &s;entiments which he delivered on the occa&s;ions already men|tioned, have not been pre&s;erved to us, either by him&s;elf or by others. He was alarmed by the appearance of the crop in 1795, even before the harve&s;t. In the autumn of that year, when the
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
produce of the harve&s;t began to be known, the alarm became general. Various projects, as in &s;uch ca&s;es will always happen, were offered to Government; and, in his opinion, &s;eemed to be received with too much complai&s;ance. Under this impre&s;&s;ion, anxious as he ever was, even in his retirement, and in the mid&s;t of his own private affliction, for the publick &s;afety and pro&s;|perity, he immediately addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Pitt a Me|morial, which is the ground-work of the follow|ing tract. Afterwards, con&s;idering the import|ance of the matter, and fearing a long cycle of &s;carcity to come, he intended to have dilated the &s;everal branches of the argument, and to have moulded his "Thoughts and Details" into a more popular &s;hape. This he purpo&s;ed to have done in a &s;eries of letters on rural oeconomics, in&s;cribed to his friend Mr. Arthur Young. It may be remem|bered, that he even announced this de&s;ign in an adverti&s;ement. But his attention was irre&s;i&s;tibly called another way. His whole mind was en|gro&s;&s;ed by the change of policy which di&s;cover|ed it&s;elf in our councils at that period, when forgetting the manly arts, by which alone great nations have ever extricated them&s;elves from momentous and doubtful conflicts, we de&s;cend|ed, again&s;t the remon&s;trances of our allies, to the
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
voluntary and unnece&s;&s;ary humiliation of &s;olicit|ing a peace, which, in his judgment, the ani|mo&s;ity of our in&s;olent enemy was not then di&s;|po&s;ed to grant, and which, if offered, we could not then have accepted, without the certainty of incurring dangers much more formidable than any that threatened us from the protraction of the war. He ha&s;tened to rai&s;e and re-in&s;pirit the pro&s;trate genius of his country. In a great mea|&s;ure he &s;ucceeded, and was &s;till employed in the pious office, when Divine Providence took him to receive the reward of tho&s;e, who devote them|&s;elves to the cau&s;e of virtue and religion. After his decea&s;e, two or three detached fragments only of the fir&s;t letter to Mr. Young were found among his papers. The&s;e could not be printed in that imperfect &s;tate, and they &s;eemed too precious to be wholly thrown a&s;ide. They have been in&s;erted, therefore, in the Memorial, where they &s;eemed be&s;t to cohere. The fir&s;t and large&s;t of the&s;e interpolations reaches from the middle of the &s;ixth to the bottom of the 18th page; the &s;econd commences near the bottom of the 20th, and ends a little below the middle of the 24th; and the la&s;t, occupying about three pages and a half, forms the pre&s;ent con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="10">The Memorial had been fairly copied, but did not appear to have been examined or corrected, as &s;ome trifling errors of the tran&s;criber were perceptible in it. The manu&s;cript of the frag|ments was a rough draft from the Author's own hand, much blotted and very confu&s;ed. It has been followed with as much fidelity as was po&s;|&s;ible, after con&s;ulting tho&s;e who were mo&s;t accu&s;tomed to Mr. Burke's manner of writing. Two or three cha&s;ms in the grammar and &s;en&s;e, from the ca&s;ual omi&s;&s;ion of two or three unim|portant words at a di&s;tance, have been &s;upplied by conjecture. The principal alteration has been the nece&s;&s;ary change of the &s;econd for the third per&s;on, and the con&s;equent &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the common form of affectionate addre&s;s, where Mr. Young is named. That gentleman alone can have rea&s;on to complain of this liberty, ina&s;much as it may &s;eem to have deprived him of that, which in &s;ome &s;ort was his property, and which no man would have known better how to value. But, it is hoped, he will pardon it, &s;ince in this manner alone the&s;e <HI>golden frag|ments</HI> (to borrow a favourite phra&s;e of critics and commentators) could have been made, as they were de&s;igned to be, of general utility. To the reader no apology is due, if the di&s;qui&s;itions thus interwoven may &s;eem a little di&s;propor|tioned
<PB N="xi" REF="11">
to the &s;ummary &s;tatements of the ori|ginal Memorial. Their own intrin&s;ic worth and beauty will be an ample compen&s;ation for that &s;light deformity; though perhaps in &s;uch a compo&s;ition, as this profe&s;&s;es to be (and the title is Mr. Burke's own) nothing of the kind could have been fairly regarded as an irregular excre&s;cence, had it been placed by him&s;elf, where it now &s;tands.</P>
<P>The Memorial, which was indeed communi|cated to &s;everal members of the King's Govern|ment, was believed at the time to have been not wholly unproductive of good. The enquiry, which had been actually begun, into the quan|tity of corn in hand, was &s;ilently dropped. The &s;cheme of public granaries, if it ever exi&s;ted, was abandoned. In Parliament the Mini&s;ters maintained a prudent and dignified forbearance; and repre&s;&s;ed in others, or where they could not entirely controul, interpo&s;ed to moderate and divert, that re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of legi&s;lation, which is an evil that &s;eems to grow up, as the vehemence of party-contention abates. The con&s;i&s;tency and good &s;en&s;e of the Commons defeated an at|tempt, which was made towards the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ions, to revive again&s;t fore&s;tallers of one par|ticular de&s;cription, &s;ome portion of the exploded laws.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="12">La&s;t year, on the approach of our pre&s;ent di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, the &s;ame excellent temper of mind &s;eem|ed to prevail in Government, in Parliament, and among the people. There was no propo&s;al of taking &s;tock, no &s;peculation of creating a new e&s;tabli&s;hment of royal purveyors to provide us with our daily dole of bread. The corn mer|chants were early a&s;&s;ured that they &s;hould not again have to contend with the competition of the Trea&s;ury, in the foreign market. A Com|mittee of the Hou&s;e of Commons ventured to di&s;&s;uade the &s;topping of the di&s;tilleries in a report, very clo&s;ely coinciding with the rea&s;oning of Mr. Burke. Little or no popular declamation was heard on the mi&s;eries of "the labouring poor;" not a &s;ingle petition was pre&s;ented, or motion made, again&s;t fore&s;tallers. The lea&s;t objectionable of the experiments &s;ugge&s;ted, to encrea&s;e the &s;upply or le&s;&s;en the con&s;umption, were adopted. It is hardly worthy of mention, as an exception, that a Parliamentary charter was granted to a company of very worthy and well-meaning per&s;ons, who, on the notion of a combination (which, by the way, they to|tally failed in proving) among the trades that &s;upply the capital with bread, opened a &s;ub&s;crip|tion for undertaking to furni&s;h nearly one-tenth of the con&s;umption. They were contented to
<PB N="xiii" REF="13">
do this with limited profits, merely as humane badgers and jobbers, charitable millers, &s;enti|mental mealmen, and philanthropic bakers. But di&s;tru&s;ting a little their own &s;ufficiency for their new bu&s;ine&s;s, they naturally de&s;ired to be ex|empted from the operation of the bankrupt laws; and their bill was carried by a very &s;mall ma|jority, con&s;i&s;ting of partners in the firm. All this while, under trials much more &s;evere than in the former dearth, the inferior cla&s;&s;es di&s;|played a patience and re&s;ignation, only to be equalled by the alacrity and zeal, which the higher and middle orders every where manife&s;t|ed, to relieve the nece&s;&s;ities of their poorer neigh|bours in every practicable mode.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent is a &s;ea&s;on of ferment and riot. The old cry again&s;t fore&s;tallers has been rai&s;ed again with more violence than ever. It has been adjudged, for the fir&s;t time, it is pre&s;umed, &s;ince the repealing act of 1772, that they are &s;till liable to be puni&s;hed by the common law, with fine and impri&s;onment at lea&s;t, if not with whipping and the pillory, according to the no|tion which the judge may entertain of their crime.</P>
<P>The interpreters of the law mu&s;t ex|pound it, according to their con&s;cientious judg|ments, as it is; and the doctrine is not quite
<PB N="xiv" REF="14">
new. It has certainly been &s;ugge&s;ted in grave books &s;ince the repeal. Yet men of &s;ober minds have doubted, and will doubt, whether in the whole code of cu&s;toms and u&s;ages, derived to us from our ance&s;tors, there can be found any one part &s;o radically inapplicable to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the country, as their Trade law; which, formed before commerce can be &s;aid to have exi&s;ted, on mixed con&s;iderations, of police for the prevention of theft and rapine, and of pro|tection to the intere&s;t of the Lord in the rights of toll and &s;tallage, permitted no tran&s;action of bargain and &s;ale in any kind of commodity, but openly at a market, or a fair, and more anciently &s;till, with the addition of witne&s;&s;es al&s;o before the magi&s;trate, or the prie&s;t; which knew of no com|mercial principle, but that of putting, in every in&s;tance, the grower, the maker, or the importer, native and foreigner alike, at the mercy of the con&s;umer, and for that purpo&s;e prohibited every intermediate profit, and every practice by act, by word, or by writing, that could enhance the price; by which, if the dragging of the mould|ering records into day be not a mere robbery of the moths and worms, &s;hould a gentleman en|courage fi&s;hermen, brewers, and bakers to &s;ettle on his e&s;tate, it may be pronounced a <HI>fore&s;tal|lage</HI> of the next town, and a &s;ilk merchant,
<PB N="xv" REF="15">
&s;hould he <HI>a&s;k</HI> too much for his raw and organ|zine (the unfortunate Lombard in the a&s;&s;ize-book only a&s;ked, he did not get it from the poor <HI>&s;ilkewemen</HI>) may be puni&s;hed by a heavy fine; which cannot now be partially in force again&s;t one &s;et of dealers, and abrogated by di&s;u&s;e with regard to all others; which, if generally applied for a &s;ingle term, without the interpo&s;ition of that wi&s;dom of Parliament, over which this re&s;ort to the common law is by &s;ome regarded as a tri|umph, would more effectually clog, di&s;tre&s;s, and ruin our foreign and dome&s;tic commerce in all its branches, than a confederacy of the whole world again&s;t us in many years.</P>
<P>Be the late convictions, however, what they may, in legal merits; their practical effects have been much to be deplored. Gro&s;s minds di&s;torted them into authorities to prove, that there was plenty in the land, and that the arts of greedy and unfeeling men alone intercepted the bounty of Providence. Meetings were called; non-con|&s;umption agreements were &s;igned, to fix a com|pul&s;ory price, and a&s;&s;ociations were formed, chiefly in cities and great towns, to pro&s;ecute tho&s;e, without whom cities and great towns can never be regularly fed. There is no weak, no wild, no violent project, which did not find countenance in &s;ome quarter or other. The
<PB N="xvi" REF="16">
fall of the market immediately after the harve&s;t, and the &s;ub&s;equent ri&s;e, though the natural ef|fects of obvious cau&s;es, encrea&s;ed the public agi|tation; and the multitude began to pur&s;ue their u&s;ual cour&s;e of providing in the &s;horte&s;t way for their in&s;tant wants, or of terrifying, or puni&s;hing tho&s;e, whom they had been taught to con&s;ider as their oppre&s;&s;ors; uncon&s;cious or unconcerned that they were thus only preparing for them|&s;elves a tenfold aggravation of their own future &s;ufferings. The eyes of all were now turned to|wards Parliament, not for a train of judicious mea&s;ures, which, if it be po&s;&s;ible, may hereafter again equalize the production with the con|&s;umption of the country, but for an immediate &s;upply; as if the omnipotence of Parliament could re&s;tore a &s;ingle grain that has been injured by the mo&s;t contemptible in&s;ect.</P>
<P>At &s;uch a juncture, however unfavourable it may be to the popularity of this little tract, the publication of it was felt to be a duty. He who wrote it, ever &s;et that con&s;ideration before him as the fir&s;t motive of all his actions. While he lived, he never cea&s;ed, publickly and privately, to warn his country and her rulers, again&s;t every danger which his wi&s;dom fore&s;aw. He now gives to her and them, this &s;olemn warning from his grave.</P>

<HEAD><HI>THOUGHTS AND DETAILS</HI> ON SCARCITY.</HEAD>
<P>OF all things, an indi&s;creet tampering with the trade of provi&s;ions is the mo&s;t dangerous, and it is always wor&s;t in the time when men are mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to it:&mdash;that is, in the time of &s;carcity. Becau&s;e there is nothing on which the pa&s;&s;ions of men are &s;o violent, and their judgment &s;o weak, and on which there exi&s;ts &s;uch a multitude of ill-founded popular prejudices.</P>
<P>The great u&s;e of Government is as a re&s;traint; and there is no re&s;traint which it ought to put upon others, and upon it&s;elf too, rather than on the fury of &s;peculating under circum&s;tances of irrita|tion. The number of idle tales &s;pread about by the indu&s;try of faction, and by the zeal of fooli&s;h
<PB N="2" REF="18">
good-intention, and greedily devoured by the ma|lignant credulity of mankind, tends infinitely to ag|gravate prejudices, which, in them&s;elves, are more than &s;ufficiently &s;trong. In that &s;tate of affairs, and of the publick with relation to them, the fir&s;t thing that Government owes to us, the people, is <HI>information</HI>; the next is timely coercion:&mdash;the one to guide our judgment; the other to regulate our tempers.</P>
<P>To provide for us in our nece&s;&s;ities is not in the power of Government. It would be a vain pre|&s;umption in &s;tate&s;men to think they can do it. The people maintain them, and not they the people. It is in the power of Government to prevent much evil; it can do very little po&s;itive good in this, or perhaps in any thing el&s;e. It is not only &s;o of the &s;tate and &s;tate&s;man, but of all the cla&s;&s;es and de&s;criptions of the Rich&mdash;they are the pen&s;ioners of the poor, and are maintained by their &s;uperfluity. They are under an ab&s;olute, hereditary, and indefea&s;ible dependance on tho&s;e who labour, and are mi&s;called the Poor.</P>
<P>The labouring people are only poor, becau&s;e they are numerous. Numbers in their nature im|ply poverty. In a fair di&s;tribution among a va&s;t multitude, none can have much. That cla&s;s of de|pendant pen&s;ioners called the rich, is &s;o extremely
<PB N="3" REF="19">
&s;mall, that if all their throats were cut, and a di&s;tri|bution made of all they con&s;ume in a year, it would not give a bit of bread and chee&s;e for one night's &s;upper to tho&s;e who labour, and who in reality feed both the pen&s;ioners and them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But the throats of the rich ought not to be cut, nor their magazines plundered; becau&s;e, in their per&s;ons they are tru&s;tees for tho&s;e who labour, and their hoards are the banking-hou&s;es of the&s;e latter. Whether they mean it or not, they do, in effect, execute their tru&s;t&mdash;&s;ome with more, &s;ome with le&s;s fidelity and judgment. But on the whole, the duty is performed, and every thing returns, de|ducting &s;ome very trifling commi&s;&s;ion and di&s;|count, to the place from whence it aro&s;e. When the poor ri&s;e to de&s;troy the rich, they act as wi&s;ely for their own purpo&s;es as when they burn mills, and throw corn into the river, to make bread cheap.</P>
<P>When I &s;ay, that we of the people ought to be informed, inclu&s;ively I &s;ay, we ought not to be flattered: flattery is the rever&s;e of in&s;truction. The <HI>poor</HI> in that ca&s;e would be rendered as impro|vident as the rich, which would not be at all good for them.</P>
<P>Nothing can be &s;o ba&s;e and &s;o wicked as the political canting language, "The Labouring
<PB N="4" REF="20">
<HI>Poor."</HI> Let compa&s;&s;ion be &s;hewn in action, the more the better, according to every man's ability, but let there be no lamentation of their condition. It is no relief to their mi&s;erable circum&s;tances; it is only an in&s;ult to their mi&s;erable under&s;tandings. It ari&s;es from a total want of charity, or a total want of thought Want of one kind was never relieved by want of any other kind. Patience, labour, &s;o|briety, frugality, and religion, &s;hould be recom|mended to them; all the re&s;t is downright <HI>fraud.</HI> It is horrible to call them "The <HI>once happy</HI> la|bourer."</P>
<P>Whether what may be called moral or philo&s;o|phical happine&s;s of the laborious cla&s;&s;es is in|crea&s;ed or not, I cannot &s;ay. The &s;eat of that &s;pecies of happine&s;s is in the mind; and there are few data to a&s;certain the comparative &s;tate of the mind at any two periods. Philo&s;ophical hap|pine&s;s is to want little. Civil or vulgar happine&s;s is to want much, and to enjoy much.</P>
<P>If the happine&s;s of the animal man (which cer|tainly goes &s;omewhere towards the happine&s;s of the rational man) be the object of our e&s;timate, then I a&s;&s;ert, without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, that the condi|tion of tho&s;e who labour (in all de&s;criptions of la|bour, and in all gradations of labour, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t inclu&s;ively) is on the whole ex|tremely
<PB N="5" REF="21">
meliorated, if more and better food is any &s;tandard of melioration. They work more, it is certain; but they have the advantage of their aug|mented labour; yet whether that increa&s;e of labour be on the whole a <HI>good</HI> or an <HI>evil,</HI> is a con&s;ideration that would lead us a great way, and is not for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. But as to the fact of the melio|ration of their diet, I &s;hall enter into the detail of proof whenever I am called upon: in the mean time, the known difficulty of contenting them with any thing but bread made of the fine&s;t flour, and meat of the fir&s;t quality, is proof &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>I further a&s;&s;ert, that even under all the hard|&s;hips of the la&s;t year, the labouring people did, either out of their direct gains, or from charity, (which it &s;eems is now an in&s;ult to them) in fact, fare better than they did, in &s;ea&s;ons of common plenty, 50 or 60 years ago; or even at the period of my Engli&s;h ob&s;ervation, which is about 44 years. I even a&s;&s;ert, that full as many in that cla&s;s, as ever were known to do it before, continued to &s;ave money; and this I can prove, &s;o far as my own information and experience extend.</P>
<P>It is not true that the rate of wages has not en|crea&s;ed with the nominal price of provi&s;ions. I al|low it has not fluctuated with that price, nor ought it; and the Squires of Norfolk had dined, when
<PB N="6" REF="22">
they gave it as their opinion, that it might or ought to ri&s;e and fall with the market of provi&s;ions. The rate of wages in truth has no <HI>direct</HI> relation to that price. Labour is a commodity like every other, and ri&s;es or falls according to the demand. This is in the nature of things; however, the nature of things has provided for their nece&s;&s;ities. Wages have been twice rai&s;ed in my time, and they bear a full proportion, or even a greater than formerly, to the medium of provi&s;ion during the la&s;t bad cycle of twenty years. They bear a full proportion to the re&s;ult of their labour. If we were wildly to attempt to force them beyond it, the &s;tone which we had forced up the hill would only fall back upon them in a dimini&s;hed demand, or, what in|deed is the far le&s;&s;er evil, an aggravated price of all the provi&s;ions, which are the re&s;ult of their manual toil.</P>
<P>There is an implied contract, much &s;tronger than any in&s;trument or article of agreement, be|tween the labourer in any occupation and his em|ployer&mdash;that the labour, &s;o far as that labour is concerned, &s;hall be &s;ufficient to pay to the em|ployer a profit on his capital, and a compen&s;ation for his ri&s;k; in a word, that the labour &s;hall pro|duce an advantage equal to the payment. What|ever is above that, is a direct <HI>tax</HI>; and if the
<PB N="7" REF="23">
amount of that tax be left to the will and plea&s;ure of another, it is an <HI>arbitrary tax.</HI></P>
<P>If I under&s;tand it rightly, the tax propo&s;ed on the farming intere&s;t of this kingdom, is to be le|vied at what is called the di&s;cretion of ju&s;tices of peace.</P>
<P>The que&s;tions ari&s;ing on this &s;cheme of arbi|trary taxation are the&s;e&mdash;Whether it is better to leave all dealing, in which there is no force or fraud, collu&s;ion or combination, entirely to the per&s;ons mutually concerned in the matter con|tracted for; or to put the contract into the hands of tho&s;e, who can have none, or a very remote in|tere&s;t in it, and little or no knowledge of the &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>It might be imagined that there would be very little difficulty in &s;olving this que&s;tion; for what man, of any degree of reflection, can think, that a want of intere&s;t in any &s;ubject clo&s;ely connected with a want of &s;kill in it, qualifies a per&s;on to intermeddle in any the lea&s;t affair; much le&s;s in affairs that vi|tally concern the agriculture of the kingdom, the fir&s;t of all it's concerns, and the foundation of all it's pro&s;perity in every other matter, by which that pro&s;perity is produced?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="24">The vulgar error on this &s;ubject ari&s;es from a to|tal confu&s;ion in the very idea of things widely dif|ferent in them&s;elves;&mdash;tho&s;e of convention, and tho&s;e of judicature. When a contract is making, it is a matter of di&s;cretion and of intere&s;t between the parties. In that intercour&s;e, and in what is to ari&s;e from it, the parties are the ma&s;ters. If they are not completely &s;o, they are not free, and there|fore their contracts are void.</P>
<P>But this freedom has no farther extent, when the contract is made; then their di&s;cretionary powers expire, and a new order of things takes it's origin. Then, and not till then, and on a difference be|tween the parties, the office of the judge com|mences. He cannot dictate the contract. It is his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee that it be <HI>enforced</HI>; provided that it is not contrary to pre-exi&s;ting laws, or ob|tained by force or fraud. If he is in any way a maker or regulator of the contract, in &s;o much he is di&s;qualified from being a judge. But this &s;ort of confu&s;ed di&s;tribution of admini&s;trative and judicial characters, (of which we have already as much as is &s;ufficient, and a little more) is not the only per|plexity of notions and pa&s;&s;ions which trouble us in the pre&s;ent hour.</P>
<P>What is doing, &s;uppo&s;es or pretends that the far|mer
<PB N="9" REF="25">
and the labourer have oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts;&mdash;that the farmer oppre&s;&s;es the labourer; and that a gen|tleman called a ju&s;tice of peace, is the protector of the latter, and a controul and re&s;traint on the for|mer; and this is a point I wi&s;h to examine in a manner a good deal different from that in which gentlemen proceed, who confide more in their abi|lities than is fit, and &s;uppo&s;e them capable of more than any natural abilities, fed with no other than the provender furni&s;hed by their own private &s;pe|culations, can accompli&s;h. Legi&s;lative acts, at|tempting to regulate this part of oeconomy, do, at lea&s;t, as much as any other, require the exacte&s;t de|tail of circum&s;tances, guided by the &s;ure&s;t general principles that are nece&s;&s;ary to direct experiment and enquiry, in order again from tho&s;e details to elicit principles, firm and luminous general prin|ciples, to direct a practical legi&s;lative proceeding.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, I deny that it is in this ca&s;e, as in any other of nece&s;&s;ary implication, that contracting parties &s;hould originally have had different inte|re&s;ts. By accident it may be &s;o undoubtedly at the out&s;et; but then the contract is of the nature of a compromi&s;e; and compromi&s;e is founded on cir|cum&s;tances that &s;uppo&s;e it the intere&s;t of the par|ties to be reconciled in &s;ome medium. The prin|ciple of compromi&s;e adopted, of con&s;equence the intere&s;ts cea&s;e to be different.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="26">But in the ca&s;e of the farmer and the labourer, their intere&s;ts are always the &s;ame, and it is ab&s;o|lutely impo&s;&s;ible that their free contracts can be onerous to either party. It is the intere&s;t of the farmer, that his work &s;hould be done with effect and celerity: and that cannot be, unle&s;s the la|bourer is well fed, and otherwi&s;e found with &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries of animal life, according to it's habi|tudes, as may keep the body in full force, and the mind gay and cheerful. For of all the in&s;truments of his trade, the labour of man (what the ancient writers have called the <HI>in&s;trumentum vocale</HI>) is that on which he is mo&s;t to rely for the re-payment o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> hss capital. The other two, the <HI>&s;emivocale</HI> in the ancient cla&s;&s;ification, that is, the working &s;tock of cattle, and the <HI>in&s;trumentum mutum,</HI> &s;uch as carts, ploughs, &s;pades, and &s;o forth, though not all in|con&s;iderable in them&s;elves, are very much inferiour in utility or in expence; and without a given por|tion of the fir&s;t, are nothing at all. For in all things whatever, the mind is the mo&s;t valuable and the mo&s;t important; and in this &s;cale the whole of agriculture is in a natural and ju&s;t order; the bea&s;t is as an informing principle to the plough and cart; the labourer is as rea&s;on to the bea&s;t; and the farmer is as a thinking and pre&s;iding principle to the labourer. An attempt to break this chain of &s;ubordination in any part is equally ab&s;urd; but the ab&s;urdity is the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous in prac|tical
<PB N="11" REF="27">
operation, where it is the mo&s;t ea&s;y, that is, where it is the mo&s;t &s;ubject to an erroneous judg|ment.</P>
<P>It is plainly more the farmer's intere&s;t that his men &s;hould thrive, than that his hor&s;es &s;hould be well fed, &s;leek, plump, and fit for u&s;e, or than that his waggon and ploughs &s;hould be &s;trong, in good repair, and fit for &s;ervice.</P>
<P>On the other hand, if the farmer cea&s;es to profit of the labourer, and that his capital is not continu|ally manured and fructified, it is impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould continue that abundant nutriment, and cloathing, and lodging, proper for the protection of the in&s;truments he employs</P>
<P>It is therefore the fir&s;t and fundamental intere&s;t of the labourer, that the farmer &s;hould have a full incoming profit on the product of his labour. The propo&s;ition is &s;elf-evident, and nothing but the ma|lignity, perver&s;ene&s;s, and ill-governed pa&s;&s;ions of mankind, and particularly the envy they bear to each other's pro&s;perity, could prevent their &s;eeing and acknowledging it, with thankfulne&s;s to the be|nign and wi&s;e di&s;po&s;er of all things, who obliges men, whether they will or not, in pur&s;uing their own &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;ts, to connect the general good with their own individual &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="28">But who are to judge what that profit and ad|vantage ought to be? certainly no authority on earth. It is a matter of convention dictated by the reciprocal conveniences of the parties, and in|deed by their reciprocal nece&s;&s;ities.&mdash;But, if the farmer is exce&s;&s;ively avaricious?&mdash;why &s;o much the better&mdash;the more he de&s;ires to increa&s;e his gains, the more intere&s;ted is he in the good condi|tion of tho&s;e, upon who&s;e labour his gains mu&s;t principally depend.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be told by the zealots of the &s;ect of re|gulation, that this may be true, and may be &s;afely committed to the convention of the farmer and the labourer, when the latter is in the prime of his youth, and at the time of his health and vigour, and in ordinary times of abundance. But in cala|misous &s;ea&s;ons, under accidental illne&s;s, in declin|ing life, and with the pre&s;&s;ure of a numerous off|&s;pring, the future nouri&s;hers of the community but the pre&s;ent drains and blood-&s;uckers of tho&s;e who produce them, what is to be done? When a man cannot live and maintain his family by the natural hire of his labour, ought it not to be rai&s;ed by au|thority?</P>
<P>On this head I mu&s;t be allowed to &s;ubmit, what my opinions have ever been; and &s;omewhat at large.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="29">And, fir&s;t, I premi&s;e that labour is, as I have al|ready intimated, a commodity, and as &s;uch, an ar|ticle of trade. If I am right in this notion, then labour mu&s;t be &s;ubject to all the laws and princi|ples of trade, and not to regulations foreign to them, and that may be totally incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e prin|ciples and tho&s;e laws. When any commodity is carried to market, it is not the nece&s;&s;ity of the vender, but the nece&s;&s;ity of the purcha&s;er that rai&s;es the price. The extreme want of the &s;eller has rather (by the nature of things with which we &s;hall in vain contend) the direct contrary opera|tion. If the goods at market are beyond the de|mand, they fall in their value; if below it, they ri&s;e. The impo&s;&s;ibility of the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of a man, who carries his labour to a market, is totally be&s;ide the que&s;tion in this way of viewing it. The only que&s;tion is, what is it worth to the buyer?</P>
<P>But if authority comes in and forces the buyer to a price, who is this in the ca&s;e (&s;ay) of a far|mer, who buys the labour of ten or twelve labour|ing men, and three or four handycrafts, what is it, but to make an arbitrary divi&s;ion of his property among them?</P>
<P>The whole of his gains, I &s;ay it with the mo&s;t certain conviction, never do amount any thing like in value to what he pays to his labourers and
<PB N="14" REF="30">
artificers; &s;o that a very &s;mall advance upon what <HI>one</HI> man pays to <HI>many,</HI> may ab&s;orb the whole of what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and amount to an actual parti|tion of all his &s;ub&s;tance among them. A perfect equality will indeed be produced;&mdash;that is to &s;ay, equal want, equal wretchedne&s;s, equal beggary, and on the part of the partitioners, a woeful, help|le&s;s, and de&s;perate di&s;appointment. Such is the event of all compul&s;ory equalizations. They pull down what is above. They never rai&s;e what is be|low: and they depre&s;s high and low together be|neath the level of what was originally the lowe&s;t.</P>
<P>If a commodity is rai&s;ed by authority above what it will yield with a profit to the buyer, that commodity will be the le&s;s dealt in. If a &s;econd blundering interpo&s;ition be u&s;ed to correct the blunder of the fir&s;t, and an attempt is made to force the purcha&s;e of the commodity (of labour for in&s;tance), the one of the&s;e two things mu&s;t hap|pen, either that the forced buyer is ruined, or the price of the product of the labour, in that propor|tion, is rai&s;ed. Then the wheel turns round, and the evil complained of falls with aggravated weight on the complainant. The price of corn, which is the re&s;ult of the expence of all the operations of hu&s;bandry, taken together, and for &s;ome time con|tinued, will ri&s;e on the labourer, con&s;idered as a con&s;umer. The very be&s;t will be, that he remains
<PB N="15" REF="31">
where he was. But if the price of the corn &s;hould not compen&s;ate the price of labour, what is far more to be feared, the mo&s;t &s;erious evil, the very de&s;truc|tion of agriculture it&s;elf, is to be apprehended.</P>
<P>Nothing is &s;uch an enemy to accuracy of judg|ment as a coar&s;e ditcrimination; a want of &s;uch cla&s;&s;ification and di&s;tribution as the &s;ubject admits of. Encrea&s;e the rate of wages to the labourer, &s;ay the regulators&mdash;as if labour was but one thing and of one value. But this very broad generic term, <HI>labour,</HI> admits, at lea&s;t, of two or three &s;pe|cific de&s;criptions: and the&s;e will &s;uffice, at lea&s;t, to let gentlemen di&s;cern a little the nece&s;&s;ity of proceeding with caution in their coercive guidance of tho&s;e who&s;e exi&s;tence depends upon the ob&s;er|vance of &s;till nicer di&s;tinctions and &s;ub-divi&s;ions, than commonly they re&s;ort to in forming their judgments on this very enlarged part of economy.</P>
<P>The labourers in hu&s;bandry may be divided: 1&s;t. into tho&s;e who are able to perform the full work of a man; that is, what can be done by a per&s;on from twenty-one years of age to fifty. I know no hu&s;bandry work (mowing hardly excepted) that is not equally within the power of all per&s;ons within tho&s;e ages, the more advanced fully compen&s;ating by knack and habit what they lo&s;e in activity. Un|que&s;tionably, there is a good deal of difference
<PB N="16" REF="32">
between the value of one man's labour and that of another, from &s;trength, dexterity, and hone&s;t appli|cation. But I am quite &s;ure, from my be&s;t ob&s;erva|tion, that any given five men will, in their total, afford a proportion of labour equal to any other five within the periods of life I have &s;tated; that is, that among &s;uch five men there will be one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the qualifications of a good workman, one bad, and the other three middling, and approximating to the fir&s;t and the la&s;t. So that in &s;o &s;mall a platoon as that of even five, you will find the full complement of all that five men <HI>can</HI> earn. Taking five and five throughout the kingdom, they are equal: therefore, an error with regard to the equa|lization of their wages by tho&s;e who employ five, as farmers do at the very lea&s;t, cannot be con&s;i|derable.</P>
<P>2dly. Tho&s;e who are able to work, but not the complete ta&s;k of a day-labourer. This cla&s;s is in|finitely diver&s;ified, but will aptly enough fall into principal divi&s;ions. <HI>Men,</HI> from the decline, which after fifty becomes every year more &s;en&s;ible, to the period of debility and decrepitude, and the maladies that precede a final di&s;&s;olution. <HI>Women,</HI> who&s;e employment on hu&s;bandry is but occa&s;ional, and who differ more in effective labour one from another than men do, on account of ge&s;tation, nur&s;ing, and dome&s;tic management, over and above
<PB N="17" REF="33">
the difference they have in common with men in advancing, in &s;tationary, and in declining life. <HI>Children,</HI> who proceed on the rever&s;e order, grow|ing from le&s;s to greater utility, but with a &s;till greater di&s;proportion of nutriment to labour than is found in the &s;econd of the&s;e &s;ub-divi&s;ions; as is vi&s;ible to tho&s;e who will give them&s;elves the trou|ble of examining into the interior economy of a poor-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This inferior cla&s;&s;ification is introduced to &s;hew, that laws pre&s;cribing, or magi&s;trates exerci&s;ing, a very &s;tiff, and often inapplicable rule, or a blind and ra&s;h di&s;cretion, never can provide the ju&s;t pro|portions between earning and &s;alary on the one hand, and nutriment on the other: whereas in|tere&s;t, habit, and the tacit convention, that ari&s;e from a thou&s;and namele&s;s circum&s;tances, produce a <HI>tact</HI> that regulates without difficulty, what laws and magi&s;trates cannot regulate at all. The fir&s;t cla&s;s of labour wants nothing to equalize it; it equalizes it&s;elf. The &s;econd and third are not capable of any equalization.</P>
<P>But what if the rate of hire to the labourer comes far &s;hort of his nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and the calamity of the time is &s;o great as to threaten actual famine? Is the poor labourer to be aban|doned to the flinty heart and griping hand of
<PB N="18" REF="34">
ba&s;e &s;elf-intere&s;t, &s;upported by the &s;word of law, e&s;pecially when there is rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that the very avarice of farmers them&s;elves has concurred with the errors of Government to bring famine on the land.</P>
<P>In that ca&s;e, my opinion is this. Whenever it happens that a man can claim nothing according to the rules of commerce, and the principles of ju&s;tice, he pa&s;&s;es out of that department, and comes within the juri&s;diction of mercy. In that province the magi&s;trate has nothing at all to do: his inter|ference is a violation of the property which it is his office to protect. Without all doubt, charity to the poor is a direct and obligatory duty upon all Chri&s;tians, next in order after the payment of debts, full as &s;trong, and by nature made infinitely more delightful to us. Puffendorf, and other ca&s;ui&s;ts do not, I think, denominate it quite pro|perly, when they call it a duty of imperfect obliga|tion. But the manner, mode, time, choice of ob|jects, and proportion, are left to private di&s;cretion; and perhaps, for that very rea&s;on it is performed with the greater &s;atisfaction, becau&s;e the di&s;charge of it has more the appearance of freedom; recom|mending us be&s;ides very &s;pecially to the divine favour, as the exerci&s;e of a virtue mo&s;t &s;uitable to a being &s;en&s;ible of it's own infirmity.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="35">The cry of he people in cities and towns, though unfortunately (from a fear of their multi|tude and combination) the mo&s;t regarded, ought, in <HI>fact,</HI> to be the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> attended to upon this &s;ubject; for citizens are in a &s;tate of utter ignorance of the means by which they are to be fed, and they contri|bute little or nothing, except in an infinitely circui|tous manner, to their own maintenance. They are truly <HI>"Fruges con&s;umere nati."</HI> They are to be heard with great re&s;pect and attention upon matters within their province, that is, on trades and manufactures; but on any thing that relates to agriculture, they are to be li&s;tened to with the &s;ame <HI>reverence</HI> which we pay to the dogmas of other ignorant and pe&s;ump|tuous men.</P>
<P>If any one were to tell them, that they were to give in an account of all the &s;tock in their &s;hops; that attempts would be made to limit their profits, or rai&s;e the price of the labouring manufacturers upon them, or recommend to Government, out of a capital from the publick revenues, to &s;et up a &s;hop of the &s;ame commodities, in order to rival them, and keep them to rea&s;onable dealing, they would very &s;oon &s;ee the impudence, inju&s;tice, and oppre&s;|&s;ion of &s;uch a cour&s;e. They would not be mi&s;|taken; but they are of opinion, that agriculture is to be &s;ubject to other laws, and to be governed by other principles.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="36">A greater and more ruinous mi&s;take cannot be fallen into, than that the trades of agriculture and grazing can be conducted upon any other than the common principles of commerce; namely, that the producer &s;hould be permitted, and even expected, to look to all po&s;&s;ible profit which, without fraud or violence, he can make; to turn plenty or &s;car|city to the be&s;t advantage he can; to keep back or to bring forward his commodities at his plea&s;ure; to account to no one for his &s;tock or for his gain. On any other terms he is the &s;lave of the con&s;umer; and that he &s;hould be &s;o is of no benefit to the con|&s;umer. No &s;lave was ever &s;o beneficial to the ma&s;|ter as a freeman that deals with him on an equal footing by convention, formed on the rules and principles of contending intere&s;ts and compromi&s;ed advantages. The con&s;umer, if he were &s;uffered, would in the end always be the dupe of his own tyranny and inju&s;tice. The landed gentleman is never to forget, that the farmer is his repre&s;en|tative.</P>
<P>It is a perilous thing to try experiments on the farmer. The farmer's capital (except in a few per&s;ons, and in a very few places) is far more feeble than commonly is imagined. The trade is a very poor trade; it is &s;ubject to great ri&s;ks and lo&s;&s;es. The capital, &s;uch as it is, is turned but once in the year; in &s;ome branches it requires
<PB N="21" REF="37">
three years before the money is paid. I believe never le&s;s than three in the turnip and gra&s;s-land cour&s;e, which is the prevalent cour&s;e on the more or le&s;s fertile, &s;andy and gravelly loams, and the&s;e compo&s;e the &s;oil in the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t of England, the be&s;t adapted, and perhaps the only ones that are adapted, to the turnip hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>It is very rare that the mo&s;t pro&s;perous farmer, counting the value of his quick and dead &s;tock, the intere&s;t of the money he turns, together with his own wages as a bailiff or over&s;eer, ever does make twelve or fifteen <HI>per centum</HI> by the year on his ca|pital. I &s;peak of the pro&s;perous. In mo&s;t of the parts of England which have fallen within my ob|&s;ervation, I have rarely known a farmer, who to his own trade has not added &s;ome other employ|ment or traffic, that, after a cour&s;e of the mo&s;t unremitting par&s;imony and labour (&s;uch for the greater part is theirs), and per&s;evering in his bu&s;i|ne&s;s for a long cour&s;e of years, died worth more than paid his debts, leaving his po&s;terity to con|tinue in nearly the &s;ame equal conflict between in|du&s;try and want, in which the la&s;t predece&s;&s;or, and a long line of predece&s;&s;ors before him, lived and died.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve that I &s;peak of the generality of farmers who have not more than from one hundred and
<PB N="22" REF="38">
fifty to three or four hundred acres. There are few in this part of the country within the former, or much beyond the latter, extent. Unque&s;tion|ably in other places there are much larger. But, I am convinced, whatever part of England be the theatre of his operations, a farmer who cultivates twelve hundred acres, which I con&s;ider as a large farm, though I know there are larger, cannot pro|ceed, with any degree of &s;afety and effect, with a &s;maller capital than ten thou&s;and pounds; and that he cannot, in the ordinary cour&s;e of culture, make more upon that great capital of ten thou&s;and pounds, than twelve hundred a year.</P>
<P>As to the weaker capitals, an ea&s;y judgment may be formed by what very &s;mall errors they may be farther attenuated, enervated, rendered unproduc|tive, and perhaps totally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>This con&s;tant precariou&s;ne&s;s and ultimate mo|derate limits of a farmer's fortune, on the &s;tronge&s;t capital, I pre&s;s, not only on account of the hazard|ous &s;peculations of the times, but becau&s;e the ex|cellent and mo&s;t u&s;eful works of my friend, Mr. Arthur Young, tend to propagate that error (&s;uch I am very certain it is, of the largene&s;s of a far|mer's profits. It is not that his account of the produce does often greatly exceed, but he by no means makes the proper allowance for accidents

and lo&s;&s;es. I might enter into a convincing detail, if other more trouble&s;ome and more nece&s;&s;ary de|tails were not before me.</P>
<P>This propo&s;ed di&s;cretionary tax on labour militates with the recommendations of the Board of Agriculture: they recommend a general u&s;e of the drill culture. I agree with the Board, that where the &s;oil is not exce&s;&s;ively heavy, or incum|bered with large loo&s;e &s;tones (which however is the ca&s;e with much otherwi&s;e good land), that cour&s;e is the be&s;t, and mo&s;t productive, provided that the mo&s;t accurate eye; the mo&s;t vigilant &s;uper|intendance; the mo&s;t prompt activity, which has no &s;uch day as to-morrow in its calendar; the mo&s;t &s;teady fore&s;ight and pre-di&s;po&s;ing order to have every body and every thing ready in it's place, and prepared to take advantage of the fortunate fugi|tive moment in this coquetting climate of ours&mdash; provided, I &s;ay, all the&s;e combine to &s;peed the plough, I admit its &s;uperiority over the old and general methods. But under procra&s;tinating, im|provident, ordinary hu&s;bandmen, who may neg|lect or let &s;lip the few opportunities of &s;weetening and purifying their ground with perpetually reno|vated toil, and undi&s;&s;ipated attention, nothing, when tried to any extent, can be wor&s;e, or more dangerous: the farm may be ruined, in&s;tead of having the &s;oil enriched and &s;weetened by it.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="40">But the excellence of the method on a proper &s;oil, and conducted by an hu&s;bandman, of whom there are few, being readily granted, how, and on what conditions, is this culture obtained? Why, by a very great encrea&s;e of labour; by an augmen|tation of the third part, at lea&s;t, of the hand-labour, to &s;ay nothing of the hor&s;es and machinery employed in ordinary tillage. Now, every man mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible how little becoming the gravity of Legi&s;lature it is to encourage a Board, which re|commends to us, and upon very weighty rea&s;ons unque&s;tionably, an enlargement of the capital we employ in the operations of the land, and then to pa&s;s an act which taxes that manual labour, al|ready at a very high rate; thus compelling us to dimini&s;h the quantity of labour which in the vul|gar cour&s;e we actually employ.</P>
<P>What is true of the farmer is equally true of the middle man; whether the middle man acts as fac|tor, jobber, &s;ale&s;man, or &s;peculator, in the markets of grain. The&s;e traders are to be left to their free cour&s;e; and the more they make, and the richer they are, and the more largely they deal, the better both for the farmer and con&s;umer, between whom they form a natural and mo&s;t u&s;eful link of connec|tion; though, by the machinations of the old evil coun&s;ellor, <HI>Envy,</HI> they are hated and maligned by both parties.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="41">I hear that middle men are accu&s;ed of mono|poly. Without que&s;tion, the monopoly of autho|rity is, in every in&s;tance and in every degree, an evil; but the monopoly of capital is the contrary. It is a great benefit, and a benefit particularly to the poor. A trade&s;man who has but a hundred pound capital, which (&s;ay) he can turn but once a year, cannot live upon a <HI>profit</HI> of 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> be|cau&s;e he cannot live upon ten pounds a year; but a man of ten thou&s;and pounds capital can live and thrive upon 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> profit in the year, becau&s;e he has five hundred pounds a year. The &s;ame proportion holds in turning it twice or thrice. The&s;e principles are plain and &s;imple; and it is not our ignorance, &s;o much as the levity, the envy, and the malignity of our nature, that hinders us from perceiving and yielding to them: but we are not to &s;uffer our vices to u&s;urp the place of our judgment.</P>
<P>The balance between con&s;umption and produc|tion makes price. The market &s;ettles, and alone can &s;ettle, that price. Market is the meeting and conference of the <HI>con&s;umer</HI> and <HI>producer,</HI> when they mutually di&s;cover each other's wants. Nobody, I believe, has ob&s;erved with any reflection what market is, without being a&s;toni&s;hed at the truth, the correctne&s;s, the celerity, the general equity, with which the balance of wants is &s;ettled. They
<PB N="26" REF="42">
who wi&s;h the de&s;truction of that balance, and would fain by arbitrary regulation decree, that de|fective production &s;hould not be compen&s;ated by encrea&s;ed price, directly lay their <HI>axe</HI> to the root of production it&s;elf.</P>
<P>They may even in one year of &s;uch fal&s;e policy, do mi&s;chiefs incalculable; becau&s;e the trade of a farmer is, as I have before explained, one of the mo&s;t precarious in its advantages, the mo&s;t liable to lo&s;&s;es, and the lea&s;t profitable of any that is carried on. It requires ten times more of labour, of vigilance, of attention, of &s;kill, and let me add, of good fortune al&s;o, to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of a farmer with &s;ucce&s;s, than what belongs to any other trade. Seeing things in this light, I am far from pre&s;uming to cen&s;ure the late circular in&s;truc|tion of Council to Lord Lieutenants&mdash;but I confe&s;s I do not clearly di&s;cern its object. I am greatly afraid that the enquiry will rai&s;e &s;ome alarm as a mea&s;ure, leading to the French &s;y&s;tem of putting corn into requi&s;ition. For that was preceded by an inqui&s;ition &s;omewhat &s;imilar in it's principle, though, according to their mode, their principles are full of that violence, <HI>which here</HI> is not much to be feared. It goes on a principle directly oppo&s;ite to mine: it pre&s;umes, that the market is no fair <HI>te&s;t</HI> of plenty or &s;carcity. It rai&s;es a &s;u&s;picion, which may affect the tranquillity of the public mind,
<PB N="27" REF="43">
"that the farmer keeps back, and takes unfair ad|vantages by delay;" on the part of the dealer, it gives ri&s;e obviou&s;ly to a thou&s;and nefarious &s;pecu|lations.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e the return &s;hould on the whole prove favourable, is it meant to ground a mea&s;ure for en|couraging exportation and checking the import of corn? If it is not, what end can it an&s;wer? And, I believe, it is not.</P>
<P>This opinion may be fortified by a report gone abroad, that intentions are entertained of erecting public granaries, and that this enquiry is to give Government an advantage in it's purcha&s;es.</P>
<P>I hear that &s;uch a mea&s;ure has been propo&s;ed, and is under deliberation, that is, for Government to &s;et up a granary in every market town, at the expence of the &s;tate, in order to extingui&s;h the dealer, and to &s;ubject the farmer to the con&s;umer, by &s;ecuring corn to the latter at a certain and &s;teady price.</P>
<P>If &s;uch a &s;cheme is adopted, I &s;hould not like to an&s;wer for the &s;afety of the granary, of the agents, or of the town it&s;elf, in which the granary was erected&mdash;the fir&s;t &s;torm of popular phrenzy would fall upon that granary.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="44">So far in a political light.</P>
<P>In an economical light, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the con&s;truction of &s;uch granaries throughout the kingdom, would be at an expence beyond all cal|culation. The keeping them up would be at a great charge. The management and attendance would require an army of agents, &s;tore-keepers, clerks, and &s;ervants. The capital to be employed in the purcha&s;e of grain would be enormous. The wa&s;te, decay, and corruption, would be a dreadful drawback on the whole dealing; and the di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction of the people, at having decayed, tainted, or corrupted corn &s;old to them, as mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, would be &s;erious.</P>
<P>This climate (whatever others may be) is not favourable to granaries, where wheat is to be kept for any time. The be&s;t, and indeed the only good granary, is the rick-yard of the farmer, where the corn is pre&s;erved in it's own &s;traw, &s;weet, clean, whole&s;ome, free from vermin and from in&s;ects, and comparatively at a trifle of expence. This, with the barn, enjoying many of the &s;ame advantages, have been the &s;ole granaries of England from the foundation of it's agriculture to this day. All this is done at the expence of the undertaker, and at his &s;ole ri&s;k. He contributes to Government; he
<PB N="29" REF="45">
receives nothing from it but protection; and to this he has a <HI>claim.</HI></P>
<P>The moment that Government appears at market, all the principles of market will be &s;ub|verted. I don't know whether the farmer will &s;uf|fer by it, as long as there is a tolerable market of competition; but I am &s;ure that, in the fir&s;t place, the trading government will &s;peedily become a bankrupt, and the con&s;umer in the end will &s;uffer. If Government makes all it's purcha&s;es at once, it will in&s;tantly rai&s;e the market upon it&s;elf. If it makes them by degrees, it mu&s;t follow the cour&s;e of the market. If it follows the cour&s;e of the market, it will produce no effect, and the con&s;umer may as well buy as he wants&mdash;therefore all the ex|pence is incurred gratis.</P>
<P>But if the object of this &s;cheme &s;hould be, what I &s;u&s;pect it is, to de&s;troy the dealer, commonly called the middle man, and by incurring a volun|tary lo&s;s to carry the baker to deal with Govern|ment, I am to tell them that they mu&s;t &s;et up ano|ther trade, that of a miller or a mealman, attended with a new train of expences and ri&s;ks. If in both the&s;e trades they &s;hould &s;ucceed, &s;o as to exclude tho&s;e who trade on natural and private capitals, then they will have a monopoly in their hands,
<PB N="30" REF="46">
which, under the appearance of a monopoly of ca|pital, will, in reality, be a monopoly of authority, and will ruin whatever it touches. The agricul|ture of the kingdom cannot &s;tand before it.</P>
<P>A little place like Geneva, of not more than from twenty-five to thirty thou&s;and inhabitants, which has no territory, or next to none; which de|pends for it's exi&s;tence on the good-will of three neighbouring powers, and is of cour&s;e continually in the &s;tate of &s;omething like a <HI>&s;iege,</HI> or in the &s;pe|culation of it, might find &s;ome re&s;ource in &s;tate granaries, and &s;ome revenue from the monopoly of what was &s;old to the keepers of public-hou&s;es. This is a policy for a &s;tate too &s;mall for agriculture. It is not (for in&s;tance) fit for &s;o great a country as the Pope po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, where, however, it is adopted and pur&s;ued in a greater extent, and with more &s;trictne&s;s. Certain of the Pope's territories, from whence the city of Rome is &s;upplied, being obliged to furni&s;h Rome and the granaries of his Holine&s;s with corn at a certain price, that part of the papal territories is utterly ruined. That ruin may be traced with certainty to this &s;ole cau&s;e, and it ap|pears indubitably by a compari&s;on of their &s;tate and condition with that of the other part of the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical dominions not &s;ubjected to the &s;ame regulations, which are in circum&s;tances highly flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="47">The reformation of this evil &s;y&s;tem is in a man|ner impracticable; for, fir&s;t, it does keep bread and all other provi&s;ions equally &s;ubject to the chamber of &s;upply, at a pretty rea&s;onable and re|gular price, in the city of Rome. This pre&s;erves quiet among the numerous poor, idle, and natur|ally mutinous people, of a very great capital. But the quiet of the town is purcha&s;ed by the ruin of the country, and the ultimate wretchedne&s;s of both. The next cau&s;e which renders this evil in|curable, is, the jobs which have grown out of it, and which, in &s;pite of all precautions, would grow out of &s;uch things, even under governments far more potent than the feeble authority of the Pope.</P>
<P>This example of Rome which has been derived from the mo&s;t ancient times, and the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing period of the Roman empire (but not of the Roman agriculture) may &s;erve as a great caution to all Governments, not to attempt to feed the people out of the hands of the magi&s;trates. If once they are habituated to it, though but for one half-year, they will never be &s;atisfied to have it otherwi&s;e. And, having looked to Government for bread, on the very fir&s;t &s;carcity they will turn and bite the hand that fed them. To avoid that <HI>evil,</HI> Government will redouble the cau&s;es of it; and then it will become inveterate and incurable.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="48">I be&s;eech the Government (which I take in the large&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, comprehending the two Hou&s;es of Parliament) &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider that years of &s;carcity or plenty, do not come alternately or at &s;hort intervals, but in pretty long cycles and irregularly, and con&s;equently that we cannot a&s;|&s;ure our&s;elves, if we take a wrong mea&s;ure, from the temporary nece&s;&s;ities of one &s;ea&s;on; but that the next, and probably more, will drive us to the continuance of it; &s;o that in my opinion, there is no way of preventing this evil which goes to the de&s;truction of all our agriculture, and of that part of, our internal commerce which touches our agri|culture the mo&s;t nearly, as well as the &s;afety and very being of Government, but manfully to re&s;i&s;t the very fir&s;t idea, &s;peculative or practical, that it is within the competence of Government, taken as Government, or even of the rich, as rich, to &s;upply to the poor, tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries which it has plea&s;ed the Divine Providence for a while to with-hold from them. We, the people, ought to be made &s;en&s;ible, that it is not in breaking the laws of com|merce, which are the laws of nature, and con&s;e|quently the laws of God, that we are to place our hope of &s;oftening the Divine di&s;plea&s;ure to remove any calamity under which we &s;uffer, or which hangs over us.</P>
<P>So far as to the principles of general policy.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="49">As to the &s;tate of things which is urged as a rea|&s;on to deviate from them, the&s;e are the circum|&s;tances of the harve&s;t of 1795 and 1794. With regard to the harve&s;t of 1794, in relation to the no|ble&s;t grain, wheat, it is allowed to have been &s;ome|what &s;hort, but not exce&s;&s;ively; and in quality, for the &s;even and twenty years, during which I have been a farmer, I never remember wheat to have been &s;o good. The world were, however, deceived in their &s;peculations upon it&mdash;the far|mer as well as the dealer. Accordingly the price fluctuated beyond any thing I can remember; for, at one time of the year, I &s;old my wheat at 14l. a load, (I &s;old off all I had, as I thought this was a rea&s;onable price), when at the end of the &s;ea&s;on, if I had then had any to &s;ell, I might have got thirty guineas for the &s;ame &s;ort of grain. I fold all that I had, as I &s;aid, at a comparatively low price, be|cau&s;e I thought it a good price, compared with what I thought the general produce of the harve&s;t; but when I came to con&s;ider what my own <HI>total</HI> was, I found that the quantity had not an&s;wered my expectation. It mu&s;t be remembered, that this year of produce, (the year 1794) &s;hort, but excel|lent, followed a year which was not extraordinary in production, nor of a &s;uperior quality, and left but little in &s;tore. At fir&s;t this was not felt, be|cau&s;e the harve&s;t came in unu&s;ually early&mdash;earlier than common, by a full month.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="50">The winter, at the end of 1794, and beginning of 1795, was more than u&s;ually unfavourable both to corn and gra&s;s, owing to the &s;udden relaxation of very rigorous fro&s;ts, followed by rains, which were again rapidly &s;ucceeded by fro&s;ts of &s;till greater rigour than the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Much wheat was utterly de&s;troyed. The clover gra&s;s &s;uffered in many places. What I never ob|&s;erved before, the rye-gra&s;s, or coar&s;e bent, &s;uffered more than the clover. Even the meadow-gra&s;s in &s;ome places was killed to the very roots. In the &s;pring, appearances were better than we expected. All the early &s;own grain recovered it&s;elf, and came up with great vigour; but that, which was late &s;own, was feeble, and did not promi&s;e to re&s;i&s;t any blights, in the &s;pring, which, however, with all its unplea&s;ant vi&s;&s;icitudes pa&s;&s;ed off very well; and nothing looked better than the wheat at the time of blooming: &mdash;but at that mo&s;t critical time of all, a cold dry ea&s;t wind, attended with very &s;harp fro&s;ts, longer and &s;tronger than I recollect at that time of year, de&s;troyed the flowers, and withered up, in an a&s;toni&s;hing manner, the whole &s;ide of the ear next to the wind. At that time I brought to town &s;ome of the ears, for the purpo&s;e of &s;hewing to my friends the operation of tho&s;e unnatural fro&s;ts, and according to their extent I predicted a
<PB N="35" REF="51">
great &s;carcity. But &s;uch is the plea&s;ure of agree|able pro&s;pects, that my opinion was little regarded.</P>
<P>On thre&s;hing, I found things as I expected&mdash; the ears not filled, &s;ome of the cap&s;ules quite empty, and &s;everal others containing only withered hungry grain, inferior to the appearance of rye. My be&s;t ears and grains were not fine; never had I grain of &s;o low a quality&mdash;yet I &s;old one load for 21l. At the &s;ame time I bought my &s;eed wheat (it was ex|cellent) at 23l. Since then the price has ri&s;en, and I have &s;old about two load of the &s;ame &s;ort at 23l. Such was the &s;tate of the market when I left home la&s;t Monday. Little remains in my barn. I hope &s;ome in the rick may be better; &s;ince it was earlier &s;own, as well as I can recollect. Some of my neighbours have better, &s;ome quite as bad, or even wor&s;e. I &s;u&s;pect it will be found, that where|ever the blighting wind and tho&s;e fro&s;ts at bloom|ing time have prevailed, the produce of the wheat crop will turn out very indifferent. Tho&s;e parts which have e&s;caped, will, I can hardly doubt, have a rea&s;onable produce.</P>
<P>As to the other grains, it is to be ob&s;erved, as the wheat ripened very late, (on account, I con|ceive, of the blights) the barley got the &s;tart of it, and was ripe fir&s;t. The crop was with me, and
<PB N="36" REF="52">
wherever my enquiry could reach, excellent; in &s;ome places far &s;uperior to mine.</P>
<P>The clover, which came up with the barley, was the fine&s;t I remember to have &s;een.</P>
<P>The turnips of this year are generally good.</P>
<P>The clover &s;own la&s;t year, where not totally de|&s;troyed, gave two good crops, or one crop and a plentiful feed; and, bating the lo&s;s of the rye-gra&s;s, I do not remember a better produce.</P>
<P>The meadow-gra&s;s yielded but a middling crop, and neither of the &s;own or natural gra&s;s was there in any farmer's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion any remainder from the year worth taking into account. In mo&s;t places, there was none at all.</P>
<P>Oats with me were not in a quantity more con|&s;iderable than in commonly good &s;ea&s;ons; but I have never known them heavier, than they were in other places. The oat was not only an heavy, but an uncommonly abundant crop. My ground un|der pea&s;e did not exceed an acre, or thereabouts, but the crop was great indeed. I believe it is throughout the country exuberant.</P>
<P>It is however to be remarked, that as generally
<PB N="37" REF="53">
of all the grains, &s;o particularly of the pea&s;e, there was not the &s;malle&s;t quantity in re&s;erve.</P>
<P>The demand of the year mu&s;t depend &s;olely on it's own produce; and the price of the &s;pring-corn is not to be expected to fall very &s;oon, or at any time very low.</P>
<P>Uxbridge is a great corn market. As I came through that town, I found that at the la&s;t market|day, barley was at forty &s;hillings a quarter; oats there were literally none; and the innkeeper was obliged to &s;end for them to London. I forgot to a&s;k about pea&s;e. Potatoes were 5s. the bu&s;hel.</P>
<P>In the debate on this &s;ubject in the Hou&s;e, I am told that a leading member of great ability, <HI>little conver&s;ant in the&s;e matters,</HI> ob&s;erved, that the gene|ral uniform dearne&s;s of butcher's meat, butter, and chee&s;e, could not be owing to a defective produce of wheat; and on this ground in&s;inuated a &s;u&s;pi|cion of &s;ome unfair practice on the &s;ubject, that called for enquiry.</P>
<P>Unque&s;tionably the mere deficiency of wheat could not cau&s;e the dearne&s;s of the other articles, which extends not only to the provi&s;ions he men|tioned, but to every other without exception.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="54">The cau&s;e is indeed &s;o very plain and obvious, that the wonder is the other way. When a pro|perly directed enquiry is made, the gentlemen who are amazed at the price of the&s;e commodities will find, that when hay is at &s;ix pound a load, as they mu&s;t know it is, herbage, and for more than one year, mu&s;t be &s;canty, and they will conclude, that if gra&s;s be &s;carce, beef, veal, mutton, butter, milk, and chee&s;e, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be dear.</P>
<P>But to take up the matter &s;omewhat more in detail&mdash;if the wheat harve&s;t in 1794, excellent in quality, was defective in quantity, the barley har|ve&s;t was in quality ordinary enough; and in quan|tity deficient. This was &s;oon felt in the price of malt.</P>
<P>Another article of produce (beans) was not at all plentiful. The crop of pea&s;e was wholly de&s;troyed, &s;o that &s;everal farmers pretty early gave up all hopes on that head, and cut the green haulm as fodder for the cattle, then peri&s;hing for want of food in that dry and burning &s;ummer. I my&s;elf came off better than mo&s;t&mdash;I had about the fourth of a crop of pea&s;e.</P>
<P>It will be recollected, that, in a manner, all the bacon and pork con&s;umed in this country, (the far large&s;t con&s;umption of meat out of towns) is, when
<PB N="39" REF="55">
growing, fed on gra&s;s, and on whey, or &s;kimmed milk; and when fatting, partly on the latter. This is the ca&s;e in the dairy countries, all of them great breeders and feeders of &s;wine; but for the much greater part, and in all the corn countries, they are fattened on beans, barley meal, and pea&s;e. When the food of the animal is &s;carce, his fle&s;h mu&s;t be dear. This, one would &s;uppo&s;e, would re|quire no great penetration to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>This failure of &s;o very large a &s;upply of fle&s;h in one &s;pecies, naturally throws the whole demand of the con&s;umer on the dimini&s;hed &s;upply of all kinds of fle&s;h, and, indeed, on all the matters of human &s;u&s;tenance. Nor, in my opinion, are we to expect a greater cheapne&s;s in that article for this year, even though corn &s;hould grow cheaper, as it is to be hoped it will. The &s;tore &s;wine, from the failure of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence la&s;t year, are now at an extravagant price. Pigs, at our fairs, have &s;old lately for fifty &s;hillings, which, two years ago, would not have brought more than twenty.</P>
<P>As to &s;heep, none, I thought, were &s;trangers to the general failure of the article of turnips la&s;t year; the early having been burned as they came up, by the great drought and heat; the late, and tho&s;e of the early which had e&s;caped, were de&s;troy|ed by the chilling fro&s;ts of the winter, and the wet
<PB N="40" REF="56">
and &s;evere weather of the &s;pring. In many places a full fourth of the &s;heep or the lambs were lo&s;t, what remained of the lambs were poor and ill-fed, the ewes having had no milk. The calves came late, and they were generally an article, the want of which was as much to be dreaded as any other. So that article of food, formerly &s;o abundant in the early part of the &s;ummer, particularly in London, and which in a great part &s;upplied the place of mutton for near two months, did little le&s;s than totally fail.</P>
<P>All the productions of the earth link in with each other. All the &s;ources of plenty, in all and every article, were dried or frozen up. The &s;carcity was not as gentlemen &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e, in wheat only.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e, and that not of incon&s;iderable operation, tended to produce a &s;carcity in fle&s;h pro|vi&s;ion. It is one that on many accounts cannot be too much regretted, and, the rather, as it was the &s;ole <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of &s;carcity in that article, which aro&s;e from the proceedings of men them&s;elves. I mean the &s;top put to the di&s;tillery.</P>
<P>The hogs (and that would be &s;ufficient) which were fed with the wa&s;te wa&s;h of that produce, did not demand the fourth part of the corn u&s;ed by farmers in fattening them. The &s;pirit was nearly &s;o much clear gain to the nation. It is an odd
<PB N="41" REF="57">
way of making fle&s;h cheap, to &s;top or check the di&s;tillery.</P>
<P>The di&s;tillery in it&s;elf produces an immen&s;e article of trade almo&s;t all over the world, to Africa, to North America, and to various parts of Europe. It is of great u&s;e, next to food it&s;elf, to our fi&s;h|eries and to our whole navigation. A great part of the di&s;tillery was carried on by damaged corn, unfit for bread, and by barley and malt of the low|e&s;t quality. The&s;e things could not be more un|exceptionably employed. The dome&s;tic con&s;ump|tion of &s;pirits, produced, without complaints, a very great revenue, applicable, if we plea&s;ed, in bounties to the bringing corn from other places, far beyond the value of that con&s;umed in making it, or to the encouragement of it's encrea&s;ed pro|duction at home.</P>
<P>As to what is &s;aid, in a phy&s;ical and moral view, again&s;t the home con&s;umption of &s;pirits, ex|perience has long &s;ince taught me very little to re&s;pect the declamations on that &s;ubject&mdash;whether the thunder of the laws, or the thunder of elo|quence, "is hurled <HI>on gin,"</HI> always I am thunder|proof. The alembic, in my mind, has furni&s;hed to the world a far greater benefit and ble&s;&s;ing, than if the <HI>opus maximum</HI> had been really found by che|mi&s;try,
<PB N="42" REF="58">
and, like Midas, we could turn every thing into gold.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly there may be a dangerous abu&s;e in the exce&s;s of &s;pirits; and at one time I am ready to believe the abu&s;e was great. When &s;pirits are cheap, the bu&s;ine&s;s of drunkenne&s;s is atchieved with little time or labour; but that evil I con&s;ider to be wholly done away. Ob&s;ervation for the la&s;t forty years, and very particularly for the la&s;t thirty, has furni&s;hed me with ten in&s;tances of drunkenne&s;s from other cau&s;es, for one from this. Ardent &s;pirit is a great medicine, often to remove di&s;tem|pers&mdash;much more frequently to prevent them, or to cha&s;e them away in their beginnings. It is not nutritive in <HI>any great</HI> degree. But, if not food, it greatly alleviates the want of it. It invigorates the &s;tomach for the dige&s;tion of poor meagre diet, not ea&s;ily alliable to the human con&s;titution. Wine the poor cannot touch. Beer, as applied to many occa&s;ions, (as among &s;eamen and fi&s;hermen for in|&s;tance) will by no means do the bu&s;ine&s;s. Let me add, what wits in&s;pired with champaign and claret, will turn into ridicule&mdash;it is a medicine for the mind. Under the pre&s;&s;ure of the cares and &s;orrows of our mortal condition, men have at all times, and in all countries, called in &s;ome phy&s;ical aid to their moral con&s;olations,&mdash;wine, beer, opium, brandy, or tobacco.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="59">I con&s;ider therefore the &s;topping of the di&s;tillery, oeconomically, financially, commercially, medici|nally, and in &s;ome degree morally too, as a mea&s;ure rather well meant than well con&s;idered. It is too precious a &s;acrifice to prejudice.</P>
<P>Gentlemen well know whether there be a &s;carcity of partridges, and whether that be an effect of hoarding and combination. All the tame race of birds live and die as the wild do.</P>
<P>As to the le&s;&s;er articles, they are like the greater. They have followed the fortune of the &s;ea&s;on. Why are fowls dear? was not this the farmer's or jobber's fault. I &s;old from my yard to a jobber, &s;ix young and lean fowls, for four and twenty &s;hil|lings; fowls, for which, two years ago, the &s;ame man would not have given a &s;hilling a piece.&mdash;He &s;old them afterwards at Uxbridge, and they were taken to London to receive the la&s;t hand.</P>
<P>As to the operation of the war in cau&s;ing the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, I under&s;tand that Mr. Pitt has given a particular an&s;wer to it&mdash;but I do not think it worth powder and &s;hot.</P>
<P>I do not wonder the papers are &s;o full of this &s;ort of matter, but I am a little &s;urpri&s;ed it &s;hould be
<PB N="44" REF="60">
mentioned in parliament. Like all great &s;tate que&s;tions, peace and war may be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and different opinions fairly formed, on political grounds, but on a que&s;tion of the pre&s;ent price of provi&s;ions, when peace with the regicides is always uppermo&s;t, I can only &s;ay, that great is the love of it.</P>
<P>After all, have we not rea&s;on to be thankful to the giver of all good? In our hi&s;tory, and when "The labourer of England is &s;aid to have been once happy," we find con&s;tantly, after certain in|tervals, a period of real famine; by which, a me|lancholy havock was made among the human race. The price of provi&s;ions fluctuated dreadfully, de|mon&s;trating a deficiency very different from the wor&s;t failures of the pre&s;ent moment. Never &s;ince I have known England, have I known more than a comparative &s;carcity. The price of wheat, taking a number of years together, has had no very con&s;iderable fluctuation, nor has it ri&s;en exceed|ingly until within this twelvemonth. Even now, I do not know of one man, woman, or child, that has peri&s;hed from famine; fewer, if any, I believe, than in years of plenty, when &s;uch a thing may happen by accident. This is owing to a care and &s;uperintendance of the poor, far greater than any I remember.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="61">The con&s;ideration of this ought to bind us all, rich and poor together, again&s;t tho&s;e wicked writers of the new&s;papers, who would inflame the poor again&s;t their friends, guardians, patrons, and protectors. Not only very few (I have ob&s;erved, that I know of none, though I live in a place as poor as mo&s;t) have actually died of want, but we have &s;een no traces of tho&s;e dreadful exterminating epidemics, which, in con&s;equence of &s;canty and unwhole&s;ome food, in former times, not unfre|quently, wa&s;ted whole nations. Let us be &s;aved from too much wi&s;dom of our own, and we &s;hall do tolerably well.</P>
<P>It is one of the fine&s;t problems in legi&s;lation, and what has often engaged my thoughts whil&s;t I followed that profe&s;&s;ion, "What the State ought to take upon it&s;elf to direct by the public wi&s;dom, and what it ought to leave, with as little inter|ference as po&s;&s;ible, to individual di&s;cretion." No|thing, certainly, can be laid down on the &s;ubject that will not admit of exceptions, many permanent, &s;ome occa&s;ional. But the cleare&s;t line of di&s;tinc|tion which I could draw, whil&s;t I had my chalk to draw any line, was this: That the State ought to confine it&s;elf to what regards the State, or the creatures of the State, namely, the exterior e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of its religion; its magi&s;tracy; its reve|nue; its military force by &s;ea and land; the cor|porations
<PB N="46" REF="62">
that owe their exi&s;tence to its fiat; in a word, to every thing that is <HI>truly and properly</HI> pub|lic, to the public peace, to the public &s;afety, to the public order, to the public pro&s;perity. In it's pre|ventive police it ought to be &s;paring of its efforts, and to employ means, rather few, unfrequent, and &s;trong, than many, and frequent, and, of cour&s;e, as they multiply their puny politic race, and dwin|dle, &s;mall and feeble. State&s;men who know them|&s;elves will, with the dignity which belongs to wi&s;|dom, proceed only in this the &s;uperior orb and fir&s;t mover of their duty, &s;teadily, vigilantly, &s;e|verely, courageou&s;ly: whatever remains will, in a manner, provide for it&s;elf. But as they de&s;cend from the &s;tate to a province, from a province to a pari&s;h, and from a pari&s;h to a private hou&s;e, they go on accelerated in their fall. They <HI>cannot</HI> do the lower duty; and, in proportion as they try it, they will certainly fail in the higher. They ought to know the different departments of things; what belongs to laws, and what manners alone can re|gulate. To the&s;e, great politicians may give a leaning, but they cannot give a law.</P>
<P>Our Legi&s;lature has fallen into this fault as well as other governments; all have fallen into it more or le&s;s. The once mighty State, which was neare&s;t to us locally, neare&s;t to us in every way, and who&s;e ruins threaten to fall upon our heads, is a &s;trong

in&s;tance of this error. I can never quote France without a foreboding &s;igh&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign">! Scipio &s;aid it to his recording Greek friend amid&s;t the flames of the great rival of his country. That &s;tate has fallen by the hands of the parricides of their country, called the Revolutioni&s;ts, and Con|&s;titutionali&s;ts, of France, a &s;pecies of traitors, of who&s;e fury and atrocious wickedne&s;s nothing in the annals of the phrenzy and depravation of man|kind had before furni&s;hed an example, and of whom I can never think or &s;peak without a mixed &s;en&s;ation of di&s;gu&s;t, of horrour, and of dete&s;tation, not ea&s;y to be expre&s;&s;ed. The&s;e nefarious mon&s;ters de&s;troyed their country for what was good in it: for much good there was in the con&s;titution of that noble monarchy, which, in all kinds, formed and nouri&s;hed great men, and great patterns of vir|tue to the world. But though it's enemies were not enemies to it's faults, it's faults furni&s;hed them with means for it's de&s;truction. My dear departed friend, who&s;e lo&s;s is even greater to the public than to me, had often remarked, that the leading vice of the French monarchy (which he had well &s;tudied) was in good intention ill-di|rected, and a re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire of governing too much. The hand of authority was &s;een in every thing, and in every place. All, therefore, that happened ami&s;s in the cour&s;e even of dome&s;tic affairs, was attributed to the Government; and, as it always

happens in this kind of officious univer&s;al inter|ference, what began in odious power, ended always, I may &s;ay without an exception, in contemptible imbecillity. For this rea&s;on, as far as I can approve of any novelty, I thought well of the Provincial Admini&s;trations. Tho&s;e, if the &s;uperior power had been &s;evere, and vigilant, and vigorous, might have been of much u&s;e politically in removing govern|ment from many invidious details. But as every thing is good or bad, as it is related or combined, government being relaxed above as it was relaxed below, and the brains of the people growing more and more addle with every &s;ort of vi&s;ionary &s;pe|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters">ion, the &s;hiftings of the &s;cene in the provin|cial the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> became only preparatives to a revolu|tion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> the k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ngdom&punc; and the popular actings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">here on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y the rehear&s;als of the terrible drama of the republic.</P>
<P>Tyranny and cruelty may make men ju&s;tly wi&s;h the downfall of abu&s;ed powers, but I believe that no government ever yet peri&s;hed from any other direct cau&s;e than it's own weakne&s;s. My opinion is again&s;t an over-doing of any &s;ort of admini&s;tra|tion, and more e&s;pecially again&s;t this mo&s;t mo|mentous of all meddling on the part of authority; the meddling with the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the people.</P>
