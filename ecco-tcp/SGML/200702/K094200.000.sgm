<HEAD>MEMOIRS Of the COURT of FRANCE, And of the CITY of PARIS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>IT was &s;oon after the Treaty, with the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> that I came to the <HI>French</HI> Court. The King found it convenient, to conclude a Peace with that Prince; thereby, to ea&s;e him&s;elf of &s;o expen&s;ive and trouble&s;ome a War, as that had prov'd; which he had been obliged to maintain on that &s;ide. This great Monarch, who having once put an end to the Civil Wars, which were rais'd in his Kingdom, while he was under age, had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in his Undertakings, that he was look'd on as a Prince whom Providence de&s;ign'd to rai&s;e above all others: found him&s;elf on a &s;udden, in danger of being ca&s;t down, from his greate&s;t height of Grandeur; all <HI>Europe</HI> being united again&s;t him; and King <HI>William,</HI> who is now in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="2" REF="3">
Throne of <HI>England,</HI> having been invited thither, by &s;ome of that Kingdom; to deliver them from the Apprehen&s;ions they were under, that their Religion, Laws and Privileges, were in danger, from the Mea&s;ures taken by King <HI>James</HI> and his Mi|ni&s;ters: engaged &s;o many Princes in his Intere&s;ts by his prudent Conduct, that in a &s;hort time, he form'd a very con&s;iderable League; and put him&s;elf at the Head of &s;o many Forces, that he was in a Condition to put a &s;top, to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's formida|ble Power; under which, every thing had bowed be|fore. So that by a Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;&s;itude, frequent enough in Governments, one de&s;cended of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> pre&s;erv'd the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> from its utter Ruin: The beginnings of which were owing to his illu&s;trious Predece&s;&s;or. Yet nothing in all this War, created more trouble to the King, than the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s declaring again&s;t him. He had often endeavour'd to take him off from the Confederates, but could not prevail. The Mare&s;hal <HI>de Catinat,</HI> who commanded his Maje&s;ty's Army in <HI>Italy;</HI> and who is as well qua|lify'd, for Negociations of State, as for the Bu&s;ine&s;s of War, was more &s;ucce&s;sful than others had been. He &s;ent the Count <HI>de Te&s;&s;e,</HI> Lieutenant General of the King's Armies, to <HI>Turin;</HI> with In&s;tructions, &s;ui|table to tho&s;e he had him&s;elf received from Court: and that he might be the better heard, his Maje&s;ty added &s;o many Troops to his Army, under the Ma|re&s;hal's Command, that he made it much Superiour to the Duke of <HI>Savoy's.</HI> He had two Rea&s;ons for doing this; one was that thereby he might make the Duke &s;en&s;ible of the Mi&s;chiefs he was capable of doing him; and the other was, that he might not be afraid of the foreign Troops, which he had call'd to his A&s;&s;i|&s;tance; who might have offer'd to pre&s;cribe to him, if they had been equal to the united Forces of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Savoy.</HI> The advantageous Propo&s;als, that were offer'd to the Duke, made him hearken to an Accom|modation. By one of the Articles of this Treaty,
<PB N="3" REF="4">
the Prince&s;s of <HI>Savoy,</HI> was to be given in Marriage to the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> &s;o &s;oon as &s;he was full twelve years of Age: Until which time, &s;he was to be edu|cated in <HI>France;</HI> for as yet &s;he wanted fifteen or &s;ix|teen months of it. And the King engaged, to give two Dukes and Peers of <HI>France,</HI> to remain Ho&s;tages in <HI>Savoy,</HI> till the Marriage &s;hould be accompli&s;h'd. The King made choice of the Dukes <HI>de Froix</HI> and <HI>de Choi&s;eul</HI> to go there, as the two Ho&s;tages; and gave each of them 12000 Livers to defray the ex|pence of their Journey. The Dutche&s;s <HI>du Lude,</HI> was appointed Lady of Honour, to this Prince&s;s. The Dutche&s;s <HI>d' Arpajou,</HI> expected to have had the Honour of this Charge, becau&s;e &s;he had it under the Dauphi|ne&s;s: And &s;he was &s;o vexed at the Di&s;appointment, that in a &s;hort time &s;he fell into an Apoplexy; which oblig'd her to go to the Waters of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> though the Sea&s;on in which they are u&s;ually taken, was al|ready pa&s;t: but it's now believ'd, they are good for that Di&s;ea&s;e at any time of the year; and therefore no regard is had to any particular Sea&s;on. The King appointed al&s;o &s;ix <HI>Dames du palais,</HI> one of which was the Counte&s;s <HI>de Roucy,</HI> who is this Dutche&s;s's Daughter; upon which account, it was thought, that the King's having neglected her &s;elf, would not affect her any more: But, as we always prefer our own Intere&s;ts to that of others, &s;he was much more &s;en|&s;ible, of the Affront, which &s;he thought was put up|on her &s;elf, than of the Honour, which was done to her Daughter. It's but of late, that the Dutche&s;s <HI>du Lude,</HI> could rea&s;onably hope, to have been &s;o for|tunate, for &s;he was not much in Favour at Court, nor of the number of tho&s;e Ladies, who are allow'd to go to <HI>Marli;</HI> and the fir&s;t time &s;he went there, it co&s;t her 2000 Crowns to the Prince&s;s <HI>d' Harcourt,</HI> who makes money of every thing, and who procur'd her that Favour. She had &s;ome Difficulty to furni&s;h the Money, yet &s;he has rea&s;on to be well-pleas'd, that &s;he employ'd it that way; for &s;he has thereby had
<PB N="4" REF="5">
Opportunities, to act her part &s;o well, that &s;he is got much into the King's Favour, and into the Favour of tho&s;e, in whom he has the greate&s;t Confidence. After &s;he was nam'd to her Charge, &s;he took Jour|ney, very &s;oon for <HI>Pout-Beauvoi&s;in,</HI> which &s;epa|rates <HI>France</HI> from the Dominions of <HI>Savoy;</HI> at which Place &s;he was to receive the Prince&s;s of <HI>Sa|voy.</HI> The Counte&s;s <HI>de Roucy</HI> went thither al&s;o, with the other five <HI>Dames du palais,</HI> whom the King had named. The Marqui&s;s <HI>de Dangeau</HI> (who had better Fortune than the Dutche&s;s <HI>d' Arpajou,</HI> for he was nam'd Gentleman of Honour to the young Prince&s;s, which was the very Charge, he had with the late Dauphine&s;s) went al&s;o to meet her, with the other Officers of her Hou&s;hold, whom the King had nam'd. The Count <HI>de Te&s;&s;e,</HI> who was made her fir&s;t Ma&s;ter of Hor&s;e, as a Reward of the good Services he had done at the Treaty, would have much rather cho&s;en to have been Gentleman of Honour. The King had &s;ome time before granted the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Dangeau,</HI> the great Privilege, of the Order of St. <HI>Lazarus;</HI> which the Count <HI>de Te&s;&s;e</HI> thought, was a &s;ufficient Reward, and that nothing more was de&s;ign'd for him, but he &s;oon found his mi&s;take: Yet he has no rea&s;on to complain of his own Fortune; for he is one of tho&s;e, whom the Court has us'd with the great|e&s;t Kindne&s;s; yea, I may add, that he is even over|burthen'd with its Favours: for in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, he was made Governour of <HI>Ypres,</HI> Knight of the Holy Gho&s;t, Collonel General of the Dragoons, Lieutenant General of the King's Armies, and fir&s;t Gentleman of the Hor&s;e to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> This might &s;eem &s;trange, but that we often &s;ee when a Courtier has once got much into Favour, the King is &s;o lavi&s;h in be&s;towing Honours and Preferments upon him, that one would think, he was to keep none in re&s;erve for others.</P>
<P>Some days after this, the Prince&s;s of <HI>Savoy,</HI> took her Journey from <HI>Turin</HI> for <HI>Pont-Beauvoi&s;in,</HI> where
<PB N="5" REF="6">
her Lady of Honour, waited for her with the King's Coaches. They whom the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> &s;ent along with her, to be her Convoy, took leave of her at that Place. And when &s;he had come as far as <HI>Lions,</HI> the Dutche&s;s <HI>du Lude,</HI> made her &s;tay a while there, as well to refre&s;h her after the Fatigue of her Journey, as to &s;atisfie the Curio&s;ity of the People, who were pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;irous to &s;ee her: after which &s;he &s;et forward in her Journey for <HI>Fountain-bleau,</HI> where the Court was at that time. The King went as far as <HI>Montargis</HI> to meet her, for he knew what day &s;he was to be there; the Dauphin went along with his Maje&s;ty, as did al&s;o the Duke and Dutche&s;s of <HI>Or|leans;</HI> and having lodg'd there that night, they came to <HI>Nemours</HI> next day to dinner, where the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> waited for them: They were then within four Leagues of <HI>Fountain-bleau,</HI> which they ea&s;ily reach'd before night. The Prince&s;s was then but a very Child, yet the King was &s;o taken with her, that he &s;tay'd full four hours in Company with her at <HI>Montargis.</HI> The Duke and Dutche&s;s of <HI>Savoy</HI> had taught her &s;o well her Le&s;&s;on, that &s;he &s;eem'd to have Wit and Sen&s;e much above her Age. The Court be|gan now to con&s;ider, what Name or Title &s;hould be given her, whether they &s;hould call her Dutche&s;s of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> or Prince&s;s of <HI>Savoy;</HI> the King inclined to the fir&s;t, though &s;he was not to be married for &s;ome con&s;iderable time: His rea&s;on was, that that Title would give her the Precedency of all the Prince&s;&s;es of the Blood, without giving them any rea&s;on to com|plain. But the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> reque&s;ted the King, that &s;he might retain her own Title, till &s;he was married to the Duke of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> He thought per|haps thereby to find a Precedent for him and his Fa|mily, henceforth to claim Precedency at the <HI>French</HI> Court; for he knew well enough, that whatever Ti|tle they gave her, &s;he &s;hould always take the door of all the Ladies about the Court: And, it &s;eems, he knew, that when one of his Ance&s;tors was in <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="7">
in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and di&s;puted for Place with <HI>Henry de Bourbon,</HI> Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> at the door of the King's Antichamber, the King took the Prince by the Hand, and made him enter fir&s;t; and to mor|tifie the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> yet farther, he told him, that he knew not what he meant, in offering to vie with a Prince who might one day be his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>However, the pre&s;ent Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> having re|que&s;ted the King, that his Daughter's Title might be continued till the Marriage; the King held a Council with his Mini&s;ters, that he might know what was fitte&s;t to be done on that Occa&s;ion: They fell upon a middle-way, which was to call her nei|ther Duthe&s;s of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> nor Prince&s;s of <HI>Savoy,</HI> but only <HI>the Prince&s;s,</HI> without adding any more; and thus &s;he was always called till the day of her Mar|riage: In the mean time, it was ordered, that &s;he &s;hould have the Precedency of all the Prince&s;&s;es of the Blood, as being the pre&s;umptive Wife of the Duke of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> The King caus'd her to be enter|tain'd with Diver&s;ions &s;uitable to her Age. And Mon|&s;ieur <HI>L' abbee de Choi&s;i,</HI> finding it was become fa&s;hio|nable, to be employ'd in &s;omething relating to the young Prince&s;s; thought, that he &s;hould make his Court wonderfully well, by writing a Narrative of every thing, that had befallen her &s;ince &s;he parted from <HI>Tarin.</HI> When this Book came fir&s;t abroad, &s;ome People got into an Humour, of commending it highly in all Companies, as the fine&s;t Piece that had appear'd of a long time: But if they had been ask'd, what they found in it that made them boa&s;t &s;o much of it, they had been puzled to tell what it was. The more ingenuous and frank &s;ort of People &s;pake quite otherwi&s;e of it, and in&s;tead of calling it &s;o fine a Piece, they own'd plainly, that it was good for no|thing. Mon&s;ieur <HI>L' abbee,</HI> who &s;ets up for an inge|nious Writer, was extremely vex'd at this; but all tho&s;e who are look'd upon as the be&s;t Judges, agree|ing in the &s;ame Opinion; his Book was by common
<PB N="7" REF="8">
con&s;ent, condemn'd for wa&s;te Paper, to be &s;ent to the Grocers Shops.</P>
<P>Before I proceed farther, I beg leave, to make a &s;hort Digre&s;&s;ion concerning this Author; he lo&s;t once fifty <HI>Lowis d' ors,</HI> at Game with that hand&s;om Lady Madam <HI>Fre&s;noi;</HI> and having no ready Money, &s;he tru&s;ted him for &s;ome time, but at la&s;t &s;ent to ask it of him; he &s;ent her in&s;tead of her Money, a Copy of &s;ome Books he had written; telling her at the &s;ame time, that if &s;he long'd for the Money, becau&s;e with|out it, &s;he had not wherewith to divert her &s;elf, at Game, as &s;he had told him, in her Note to him; &s;he might divert her &s;elf with tho&s;e Books, till &s;uch time as he could &s;atisfie her with Money. The Lady look'd upon this as a new way of paying Debts; but it tempted her to write Books as well as others, that by her own Compo&s;itions, &s;he might &s;atisfie her Cre|ditors, when they ask'd Money of her.</P>
<P>But to return to my Subject. The Duke of <HI>Sa|voy</HI> was not at all well pleas'd, that his Daughter had only the Title <HI>of Prince&s;s,</HI> without having that of <HI>Savoy</HI> added to it: But if he could not have his Ambition &s;atisfy'd in this matter, he try'd to have it in another. He caus'd a <HI>Latin</HI> In&s;cription to be &s;et up, importing that after he had enlarged the Bounds of his Dominions, and recover'd the Keys of <HI>Italy,</HI> he had &s;hut up the Temple of <HI>Janus.</HI> It cannot be &s;aid, that there was any manife&s;t Fal&s;hood in this In&s;crip|tion; yet it was &s;omewhat odd, that he &s;hould boa&s;t of &s;uch mighty Wonders, and in &s;o &s;trange a manner too: For it was never heard before, that the lo&s;ing of Battels, and a whole Province too, was the way for a Prince to enlarge his Dominions, or to reduce his Enemy to Rea&s;on. The In&s;cription was put above a triumphal Arch, which was erected at <HI>Tarin,</HI> to &s;et off a Fire-work that was rai&s;ed there, to te&s;tifie the Joy of that Place for the Peace: And it was all he could boa&s;t of from the beginning of the War; &s;ince he had lo&s;t not only his Dutchy, but the Battels of
<PB N="8" REF="9">
<HI>Staffard</HI> and <HI>Mar&s;aille</HI> into the bargain. Yet the great Number of Enemies, which <HI>France</HI> had at that time, made his Maje&s;ty reckon, that he &s;hould be a con&s;iderable Gainer, though he &s;hould deliver up <HI>Savoy</HI> to him, and even the Town and Citadel of <HI>Pignerol,</HI> which were taken by Cardinal <HI>Richeleu</HI> in Per&s;on, if by that Means he could oblige him to a Peace. By this Treaty, the Duke was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ut into as good Circum&s;tances, as if he him&s;elf had gain'd tho&s;e Battels, and conquer'd a great Province.</P>
<P>The Duke having had the Plea&s;ure to &s;ee two Dukes and Peers of <HI>France</HI> at his Court, re&s;olv'd to revenge him&s;elf, and all the Princes of his Blood, of the Affront which <HI>Henry</HI> IV. put upon their Ance&s;tor; and as that great King, had carrv'd it &s;o high in his own Hou&s;e, as to make a Prince of his own Blood, take place of a Duke of <HI>Savoy:</HI> So the pre&s;ent Duke would needs carry it &s;o high at his Court, as to make the Prince <HI>de Carignan</HI> (who is of his Fa|mily, and elder Brother to the Count <HI>de Soi&s;&s;ons</HI>) take place of the two <HI>French</HI> Dukes, when they came to pay him a Vi&s;it at his Hou&s;e. Had the King's great Ma&s;ter of Hor&s;e been there, to &s;ee a Prince triumph over the&s;e two Dukes, he had thought him&s;elf &s;ufficiently reveng'd of them; for they were &s;o far from yielding him the place in his own Hou&s;e, that they di&s;puted it with him where&s;oever they met him. Perhaps he will not &s;oon forget a Debate he had on this Score, with the Duke <HI>de Montau&s;ier;</HI> who having told him, that he never thought, nor was it ever heard, that a younger Brother, of the Fa|mily of <HI>St. Maur,</HI> would vie for Precedency with a Prince of a Sovereign Hou&s;e: The Duke <HI>de Montau|&s;ier</HI> an&s;wer'd him &s;aucily, that he would let him know, that both as a younger Brother of the Fami|ly of <HI>St. Maur,</HI> and as Duke and Peer of <HI>France,</HI> he would di&s;pute the Precedency with him where ever they &s;hould meet. But though perhaps this Duke may have been much in the right upon the one Score,
<PB N="9" REF="10">
yet certainly he was not &s;o upon the other; for a younger Brother, of the Family of <HI>St. Maur,</HI> or of any other Hou&s;e, can never be &s;uppos'd equal to the Son of a Sovereign Prince. And, perhaps, he had not &s;poke after that manner, but that the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> was, at that time, di&s;po&s;&s;ed of his Domi|nions; &s;o that he look'd upon the Princes of that Hou&s;e, but as younger Brothers of a good Family. And it was, no doubt, for this very rea&s;on, that much about the &s;ame time, the Count <HI>de Cre|qui Berniulle,</HI> enter'd into a Debate with the late Count <HI>d' Harcourt,</HI> younger Brother to the Duke <HI>d' Elbeuf,</HI> for he treated him ju&s;t as if he had been his Equal; and was &s;o very haughty, that when the Mare&s;hals of <HI>France</HI> (before whom both of them were oblig'd to appear, to give account of their Quarrel) made &s;ome Di&s;tinction between them, and order'd him to go to the Prince's Hou&s;e, and there to beg Pardon for what had pa&s;s'd, his Behaviour to him was the &s;ame as before. It's true, he went to <HI>Harcourt,</HI> where the Prince dwelt at that time; but he caus'd drive his Coach to the very door of the Parlour, where the Mare&s;hals of <HI>France</HI> had appointed the Count <HI>d' Harcourt</HI> to receive him: He found him there, with &s;ome Gentlemen of their Neighbourhood, for they them&s;elves were near Neigh|bours. The Prince had cau&s;ed Chairs to be &s;et for them, and had al&s;o re&s;erv'd one for the Count <HI>de Crequi,</HI> while he him&s;elf de&s;ign'd to &s;it in an El|bow-chair: But &s;o &s;oon as the Count <HI>de Crequi</HI> (who was always of a great Pre&s;ence of Mind) perceiv'd, that by this means, he intended to let him under|&s;tand the Difference between a Prince of a &s;ove|reign Hou&s;e, and a Gentleman of a good Family; he skilfully warded off the blow; for after he had made tho&s;e Compliments to the Prince, which the Mare|&s;hals of <HI>France</HI> order'd him to do, he went to the Chair that was re&s;erv'd for him; but in&s;tead of &s;it|ting down in it, he put one knee upon the Seat of
<PB N="10" REF="11">
it, and took hold of the back of it with his Hands: The Count <HI>d' Harcourt,</HI> who had Orders pre&s;crib'd him by the Mare&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> how to behave him|&s;elf on that Occa&s;ion, as well as he; and who was obliged not to &s;it while he was &s;tanding, told him, that it would be more for his Conveniency to &s;it down in the Chair, and that at lea&s;t, the Gentlemen who were there pre&s;ent, would take their Seats if he had once taken his: The Count <HI>d' Crequi</HI> an&s;wer'd him, that there was no need of Ceremonies among Neighbours as they were, and that he might &s;it down if he pleas'd; but as for him&s;elf, he was well enough as he was: With the&s;e words, he ended his Vi&s;it; and without giving the Prince time to make u&s;e of his Elbow-chair, took leave of him. The Prince was obliged to wait on him to the door of the Parlour; and the Di&s;tinction which he de&s;ign'd to have made between them, turn'd more to his Shame than to his Honour. And he him&s;elf &s;aid plainly to one of the Gentlemen that was at his Hou&s;e, and in whom he put Confidence, that in his life-time, there was never any thing &s;o mortified him, as the Count <HI>de Crequi</HI>'s Behaviour to him that day. The Mortification, no doubt, was great enough; but he met with one incomparably greater, (if he was &s;en|&s;ible of it) when the Prince of <HI>Condee</HI> cudgell'd him at <HI>Luxenburg.</HI> This Treatment lets us &s;ee, that every Man is Ma&s;ter in his own Hou&s;e; and that there is a great Difference between a Prince of the Blood, and any other Prince in <HI>France,</HI> though of a Sovereign Hou&s;e. However, the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s great Haughtine&s;s was brought low &s;oon after; I mean, when he went out of <HI>France,</HI> and betook him|&s;elf to the Protection of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and took part with them, to the manife&s;t Violation of that Allegiance which he ow'd his own Sovereign. I admire that we have not a full Account of all this, in the Hi&s;tory that is written of his Life. It is well enough known, that &s;o &s;oon as he was at <HI>Namur,</HI> he found Rea&s;on to re|pent,
<PB N="11" REF="12">
that ever he had left his native Country. The Author of that Hi&s;tory, methinks, &s;hould have told us all the Journeys he made from that Town to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> to <HI>Namur;</HI> endeavouring to adju&s;t the Difference about Precedency with the Archduke <HI>Leopold,</HI> who pretended to take place of him: He &s;hould have told us al&s;o, all that happen'd in a Debate of the like nature, between his mo&s;t &s;e|rene Highne&s;s, and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> If it had been Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI>'s good Plea&s;ure to have made u&s;e of this Juncture, to per&s;uade the Prince of <HI>Condee</HI> to return, he could have ea&s;ily prevail'd; for he was almo&s;t mad, at the Treatment he met with: But that Mini&s;ter, who thought it a piece of the be&s;t Policy he could contrive, to oblige him to quit <HI>France,</HI> was far from wi&s;hing his return thither. The&s;e, and a thou&s;and other curious Things, which are wholly left out, de&s;erv'd a place, in the Hi&s;tory of that Prince's Life; and it would have been much more becoming an Hi&s;torian, to have publi&s;h'd them, than to have entertain'd us, with &s;o many Trifles and fal&s;e Sto|ries.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Author did not well know the Hi|&s;tory of that Prince's Life; and he is &s;o ingenuous, as to tell us &s;o much, in the beginning of his Book; but &s;ince he acknowledged, that he was unable for &s;uch a Performance, why did he undertake it? There is no|thing, in my Opinion, more inexcu&s;able in an Author, than to confe&s;s his own Ignorance; for &s;ince he ac|knowledges his own Failings, why does he venture to write Books? A pretty Idea indeed, he gives us of his Works! Were it not a thou&s;and times better, he &s;hould &s;ay nothing of them? And may he not rea&s;onably ex|pect the common Fate of all &s;uch Authors; that is, to make him&s;elf contemptible, as they always do? When an Author is &s;o &s;illy, as to condemn him&s;elf, he mu&s;t not expect afterwards, that others will deal more gently by him, than he has done by him&s;elf.</P>

But to return to my Subject. The Prince <HI>de Ca|rignan</HI> having (as I have ju&s;t now &s;aid) reveng'd his own Family and that of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> of the Affronts that had been put upon them; there were many Dukes and Peers of <HI>France,</HI> who found their own Honour concern'd in the Treatment, which the Dukes of <HI>Froix</HI> and <HI>Choy&s;eul</HI> had met with; and therefore they con&s;ulted together at private meetings, if they &s;hould complain to his Maje&s;ty of the&s;e two Dukes, for having di&s;grac'd their Character, in bearing with a thing &s;o un|worthy of their Rank: But the wi&s;e&s;t of them, did not think fit to do it; for they thought it more than probable, that before they went from <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> they had In&s;tructions given them in Writing, how to be|have them&s;elves at <HI>Turin;</HI> and therefore they could not hope for Redre&s;s, though they &s;hould make their Complaint. In the mean time, the more Rea&s;ons the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> had to be well &s;atisfied, the more did he care&s;s the two Dukes; his very being an <HI>Ita|lian,</HI> makes him di&s;&s;emble naturally. The only thing he had to wi&s;h for, to make him compleatly &s;atisfy'd, was, that <HI>Mon&s;ieur Louvois</HI> had been &s;till alive; that he might have &s;een, with what Art and Skill he could revenge him&s;elf of Injuries that were done him; for as it was he, who had fir&s;t provok'd him to engage in a War again&s;t the King, by the Slights he had gi|ven him upon many Occa&s;ions: He would, no doubt, have been exceedingly pleas'd, could he but have ask'd him, what was now become of all that Haugh|tine&s;s and Contempt, with which he treated all the Sovereign Princes, who&s;e Power was inferiour to his Maje&s;ty's.</P>
<P>This Prince having dealt after this manner by the two Ho&s;tages, and having nothing el&s;e that could vex them; thought it convenient to &s;end them back to <HI>France,</HI> without waiting till his Daughter's Marriage &s;hould be accompli&s;h'd. The pretence he u&s;ed was, that he had &s;o much Confidence in his Maje&s;ty, that he did not de&s;ire any other Security but his Word:
<PB N="13" REF="14">
He &s;aid al&s;o to the two Dukes, that it was only for form &s;ake, that ever he had ask'd Ho&s;tages of the King; and that he was now glad of the Opportunity he had, to let all <HI>Europe</HI> &s;ee, that he did not in the lea&s;t doubt, but that his Maje&s;ty would faithfully perform every thing he had promis'd; that therefore they might return into <HI>France</HI> as &s;oon as they pleas'd: yet they would not adventure to do this till they &s;hould receive his Maje&s;ty's Orders.</P>
<P>The King has al&s;o learn'd to di&s;&s;emble, not only from the Le&s;&s;ons that Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> taught him, but al&s;o by long Experience in Government, and in the Exerci&s;e of a Sovereign Power; which has taught him, that the Art of di&s;&s;embling is one of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications for a King: He fir&s;t a&s;&s;ured the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> of his Thankfulne&s;s for his Gene|ro&s;ity, and then he order'd the two Dukes to return to <HI>France.</HI> At the &s;ame time, his Maje&s;ty &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;ador into that Country; it was the Count <HI>de Briord,</HI> who belong'd to the Prince of <HI>Condee,</HI> with|out who&s;e Knowledge he had made an Intere&s;t for that Employment; for which his Highne&s;s was high|ly offended at him, but dar'd not &s;hew his Re&s;ent|ments, for fear of a Reprimand from the King.</P>
<P>The Fea&s;t of Chri&s;tma&s;s was now at hand, and the Dutche&s;s <HI>du Lude</HI> cau&s;ed a little <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to be made, for a Pre&s;ent to the young Prince&s;s, after the cu&s;tom of <HI>Italy.</HI> She found it upon her Toilet at her Levee; and the Ca&s;e into which it was put, being of mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite and curious Work, with panes of Chry&s;tal, &s;he was altogether charmed with it. But upon New|years Day the King made her a much more magnifi|cent Pre&s;ent; for he gave her an Apron with Jewels to the value of an Hundred thou&s;and Franks in it. The Dauphin gave her another, which had co&s;t him Forty thou&s;and Franks: and the&s;e two New-years Gifts were accompanied with a third Pre&s;ent from the King, of all the Jewels that had ever belong'd to his own Queen, and to the late Dauphine&s;s. The
<PB N="14" REF="15">
Count <HI>de Thoulou&s;e,</HI> after the King's Example, gave &s;o magnificent New-years Gifts, that they &s;eem'd too great by much, for a private Per&s;on. No doubt, but what he did, was by the King's Allowance; and that even his Maje&s;ty advi&s;ed him to it. But whatever was in that, it was to the Marquis <HI>d' Antin</HI> (who is his Brother by the Mother's &s;ide) that he made tho&s;e rich Pre&s;ents; and the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s was manag'd thus: The Marqui&s;s <HI>d' Antin</HI> being gone to dine with his Brother in Law the Marquis <HI>de Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> he found under his Mapkin a Billet which was folded; he knew not what was the Import of it; and the Marquis <HI>de Barbe&s;ieux</HI> (who probably had put it there by his Maje&s;ty's Order) having forbidden him to blu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">is Lady &s;hould not know of it; he told him al&s;o, that all the Company would allow him to read it, and that they would refer it to his own Di&s;|cretion, whether he would tell them what was in it or not; for they would not at all vex him. The Marquis <HI>d' Antin</HI> aro&s;e from the Table, and went to the Window to read it. He found, that in|&s;tead of coming from a Lady, as he at fir&s;t had ima|gin'd, it was come from the Count <HI>de Thoulou&s;e,</HI> who took the Liberty to call him a big hoggi&s;h Fellow, for he look'd like one that had got enough of Food in his time: But he had no Rea&s;on to complain of this Freedom, &s;ince as the Contents of the Billet made him &s;ee clearly, that it proceeded from true Friend&s;hip: For the Count told him, that two years ago, he had re|&s;olved to give him a Pen&s;ion of Ten thou&s;and Livres a year; and that as it was but ju&s;t he &s;hould have the Benefit of it from that time; &s;o now he gave him notice, that he had not only &s;ettled it on him for the time coming, but had al&s;o order'd his Trea&s;urer immediately to pay him 20000 Livers for the two pa&s;t years. The Marquis <HI>d' Antin,</HI> being come back to the Table, told the Company, that they were not much mi&s;taken, if they thought that this was a Bil|let <HI>doux,</HI> that at lea&s;t he him&s;elf took it for one;
<PB N="15" REF="16">
and he was &s;ure he was in the right of it; and for that he would appeal to the Judgment of tho&s;e pre&s;ent. He then told them the Contents of it; and &s;o &s;oon as they had heard them, they all own'd, that it was incomparably better than any Billet that could come even from the hand&s;ome&s;t Lady. They had all the Rea&s;on in the World to think &s;o, &s;ince 10000 Livers a year, and 20000 of ready Money is well worth any Mi&s;tre&s;s; e&s;peci|ally now adays, when the World is &s;o chang'd, that whereas formerly the Men &s;ought after the Ladies, the&s;e do now &s;eek after the Men; and almo&s;t all of them are become effronted to the highe&s;t Degree; and carry on their Debauchery &s;o far, that many of them fuddle as if they were to gain no &s;mall Ho|nour and Reputation by it: and &s;ince the Cordial Liquors came in Fa&s;hion, they make u&s;e of that Pre|tence, to drink of every thing that plea&s;es their Pal|late, not excepting even Drandy it &s;elf, which they drink as if it were &s;weet Water; by which we may gue&s;s how well they reli&s;h other Liquors: and &s;eeing their Ta&s;t is &s;o viciated, that they love even that which Porters them&s;elves dete&s;ted not many years ago; it is not very probable, that they'll be at much Pains to re|&s;i&s;t tho&s;e Temptations, that procure tho&s;e Plea&s;ures, which are much more natural than the other; and which (in the Opinion of &s;ome People) are not al|together &s;o unworthy of the Female Sex. And the Truth is, the Ladies are generally &s;en&s;ible enough of this, and are become &s;o impudent in tho&s;e lewd Pra|ctices, that one, whom I know very well, and who is none of the lea&s;t con&s;iderable about the Court, know|ing &s;ome time ago that her Gallant was to be mar|ried, be&s;ought him to call at her Hou&s;e as he return'd from Church. It was the Niece of this <HI>Me&s;&s;alina</HI> whom he married; and the Niece's Mode&s;ty is as great as the Aunts Impudence: However, her Gal|lant not being able to refu&s;e her De&s;ire, was no &s;ooner in her Chamber, but &s;he ask'd another Favour of
<PB N="16" REF="17">
him, which was, that he would pa&s;s that day a bed with her; that at night her Niece might have nothing but what &s;he had left. The Bridegroom &s;tood in great need of Money, and knowing that &s;he rewarded liberally, granted her Reque&s;t; while the Friends, who were invited to the Marriage, were &s;earching throughout all the parts of the Neighbourhood to know what was become of him. Yet this is not the only Court Lady of this Stamp. But every one of them were la&s;h'd and expos'd &s;ufficiently, in &s;ome Carols and Lampoons that were compos'd and pub|li&s;h'd &s;oon after the Prince&s;s came to <HI>France.</HI> There we had the true and genuine Hi&s;tory of every one of them, without the lea&s;t Di&s;gui&s;e. 'Tis true, it is not well done to di&s;cover to the World the Faults of other People; yet the expo&s;ing of them thus, was u&s;eful to per&s;uade many of them to reflect upon their own Conduct, and to be more circum&s;pect in time coming. But the wor&s;t thing of tho&s;e Carols was, that they were &s;o full of gro&s;s Immoralities, that ma|ny who had but a &s;mall &s;hare of Religion dete&s;ted them. The King (who was never of an Humour to bear with things of that nature, and le&s;s now than ever, that he is become devout in good earne&s;t) made a deal of noi&s;e about them; and &s;aid openly before all the Court, that he had one good Coun&s;el to give the Author of them, which was, that he would make his E&s;cape in time, thereby to prevent the Puni&s;hments which he mu&s;t inevitably undergo, if ever he come to be di&s;cover'd: If the Author had follow'd this Coun&s;el, it had been the &s;ame thing as to have ac|cus'd him&s;elf; and therefore, whoever he was, he put as good a Face on it, as they could do who were &s;en&s;ible of their own Innocence. There is not the lea&s;t doubt but that he belongs to the Court, and that he is one of tho&s;e who are be&s;t acquainted with it; for no body el&s;e could know &s;o well, the Hi&s;tory of every one's Life as that Author did; though after all he was mi&s;taken in &s;ome things: However, after
<PB N="17" REF="18">
many had been &s;u&s;pected, and among the re&s;t, a Lady of very great Quality, becau&s;e her Genius bends a little that way; it came at la&s;t to be generally belie|ved, that the Chevalier de <HI>Bouillon</HI> was the man, but becau&s;e there was no certain Proof of it, and that all that was &s;aid, was founded only on &s;u&s;picion, he got no harm by it. The King was not &s;atisfied that he had &s;ignified his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t this Au|thor, who had thus &s;ignalized him&s;elf for an impious Wretch, and perhaps for a Lyar too; (for it is not probable, that all the na&s;ty things that are in tho&s;e Carolls, can be litterally true) but his Maje&s;ty made it known al&s;o, that he would not take it well, if any body &s;hould &s;ing them. But as there are &s;ome things above the Power of Kings, how great &s;oever their Authority may be: So this Order took not much effect: every body &s;ung them as before, except that they were cautious not to do it, in the hearing of tho&s;e, who they thought would give an Account of it to his Maje&s;ty. For we mu&s;t under&s;tand, that there are abundance of &s;pies about the Court; and though &s;ome of them are known, as the Marquis <HI>de Termes,</HI> and &s;ome others, yet there are of them who act their parts &s;o cunningly, that there is nothing they are le&s;s &s;u&s;|pected of, than of being what they truly are.</P>
<P>It was not only in the&s;e Carolls and Songs, that the Conduct of the Ladies was publickly cen&s;ur'd: a cer|tain Per&s;on, who is well known in the World, for an Im|ployment of a quite other kind, than what he is natu|rally fitted for, re&s;olv'd to cen&s;ure them al&s;o, in the &s;ame manner that he has for a long time, cen&s;ur'd all man|kind. As he &s;ets up for a Je&s;ter and maker of Ballads, he made &s;ome upon the Accou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rements, which the Ladies now make u&s;e of, that they may be ready for an Engagement; he brought them forth in &s;lippers, and quilted Wa&s;tcoats; ready to enter the Lifts: and though he nam'd no body, yet, as they who cen&s;ure others, mu&s;t not expect many thanks, e&s;pecially when vicious cu&s;toms are laid &s;o deep, that it s next to im|po&s;&s;ible

to root them out, &s;o his performances were &s;o unacceptable, that as a Reward of his pains, he was &s;oon born down and oppre&s;&s;ed with a World of Cen|&s;ures and Reproaches. And that much after the &s;ame manner, that he had reproached others; that is, by Ballads and Lampoons: but with this difference, that whereas, in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e which he had compos'd, he had been &s;o civil, as not to name any body; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">et they dealt &s;o rudely by him, as to name him expre&s;ly; and, which was harder upon him, that they might cha|&s;tize him yet farther, they &s;ent Copies of their Lam|poons to his three Be&s;t Friends, the Cardinal <HI>de Bouillon,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Chawnes,</HI> and the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Louvois;</HI> who&s;e hou&s;es he frequented daily, and who could not ea&s;ily be without him. They were not well pleas'd, that others &s;hould be &s;o unju&s;t, as to calumniate him, who had never calumniated any per&s;on, becau&s;e, as they &s;aid he had not nam'd any, in the Songs which he had made: Yet they cannot &s;ay, but that &s;ince the time, that from being Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts, he had dwindl'd into a Poet of the <HI>Pont|neuf;</HI> he has fallen foul upon &s;everal Per&s;ons of Quality, without being &s;o circum&s;pect; and there|fore he mu&s;t not expect, that all the World will be &s;o favourable to him, as was the Cardinal and his other Friends. And as there was no great inju&s;tice in finding fault with what he had done, as to the Ladies; &s;o, many others as well as he were of opi|nion, that they had even done be&s;t, to have laid by their &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ppers and Wa&s;tcoats. The thru&s;t he gave in, being thus &s;martly pareed, and return'd upon him|&s;elf, the poor Fellow was forc'd to &s;hut him&s;elf up in his little Clo&s;et, without daring to peep abroad for &s;ome days. But as every man returns &s;oon to his natural Temper, and as the Ladies too did not fail to provoke him anew, not to &s;pare them, as hitherto he had done; we have &s;ince had a thou|&s;and Ballads of his making, where he repre&s;ents them prettily enough.</P>

If Lewdne&s;s was &s;o ordinary at this time among the Women, it was not much le&s;s &s;o, among the Men; but e&s;pecially they were taken, with a very Frenzy and Madne&s;s, for which they could make no Apology; for be&s;ides the Vice of exce&s;&s;ive drink|ing, which many of them were addicted to, rather thro' bad cu&s;tom, than by natural inclination; they had got into an humour of preferring the Women Play|ers of the Playhou&s;e, and the Opera, to their own Wives, though never &s;o hand&s;ome; and their Hu&s;|bands were much to blame for it, if they were not mode&s;t and circum&s;pect. And thus for the leavings of a great many other People, they for&s;ook their own Wives, whom they might have enjoy'd all alone; yea, and provoked them too, to become common. For nothing more provokes a Wife to be unfaithful to her Husband, than when he &s;lights her, and prefers other Women to her.</P>
<P>The Lords of the greate&s;t Quality, were not more exempted from this vice, than were others; though they be more obliged than other People, to give good Example, for the higher and greater a Man's Station and Character is, the more is his behaviour expo&s;ed to the view of the publick.</P>
<P>There was one of them among the re&s;t, who fell in Love with a Woman of the Opera, which very much vexed his Friends and Relations; but there was one thing encouraged him in his amours, and &s;erv'd to harden him in his &s;hameful and lewd Practi|ces, and that was, that many of the mo&s;t topping Ladies about the Court, went a purpo&s;e to the Opera, that they might &s;ee his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;peak highly to her advantage; for tho&s;e who enter once into a vi|cious way of living, can applaud Vice, with as little remor&s;e, as others applaud Virtue. Tho&s;e who were concern'd in this Nobleman, had perceiv'd &s;ometime before, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve his conduct narrowly: and therefore they put a wi&s;e and &s;ober Man to attend him, who might give them an account

of his Behaviour. But as youth has an aver&s;ion to People of this &s;ort, and u&s;ually con&s;iders them, as Pedagogues, whom they cannot bear with; &s;o this young Lord endeavour'd, &s;o &s;oon as he could, to free him&s;elf of the bonds, which his friends had put upon him. All the young Gentlemen who made their court to him, confirm'd him as much as they could, in <HI>His Re&s;olution;</HI> and they call'd his Ob&s;erver by the name of <HI>Caius Garrulus,</HI> which &s;ounded not unlike his own name, and they added an Epithite to it, which was &s;omewhat &s;uitable to his Employment. This young Gallant's Father, was extreamly concern'd, when he knew that his Son was &s;o fond of this Actre&s;s: He &s;poke to him of it, as a thing which would ruin his Reputation. And at length he &s;poke to him, not only as from him&s;elf, but as from the King, to whom he knew that he pay'd very much Deference. And that his Coun&s;els might make the greater impre&s;&s;ion upon his Son's mind, he told him, that they who were fond of that &s;ort of People, met often with &s;ad mi&s;|fortunes; and that his Rank and Quality did not at all &s;ecure him again&s;t the treachery of a <HI>Coquette,</HI> and that if he mu&s;t have a Mi&s;tre&s;s, he &s;hould at lea&s;t look for one, with whom he could live with greater &s;afety than he could do with her. Notwith&s;tanding all the Deference he had for the King, and the Du|ty he ow'd to his Father, he made no other An&s;wer, but that he would do all that was in his power, to &s;atisfie both of them, but that he found &s;o &s;trong an inclination for that Woman, that he knew not if it was in his power to di&s;engage him&s;elf altogether from her, on a &s;udden. He continued (notwith&s;tanding all this) to vi&s;it her, and having told her every word his Father had &s;poke to him, they agreed that he &s;hould not pay her a vi&s;it for &s;ome days. <HI>Caius Garrulus</HI> adverti&s;ed the young Gallants Friends of the vi&s;it he had paid, maugre all his Fathers Remon&s;trances to the contrary; upon which account, his Father &s;poke once more to him, and told him, that he mu&s;t be

very incorrigible, in that he had &s;o &s;oon forgot what he had &s;aid to him formerly; and that being of &s;o high a birth, as he was he ought at lea&s;t to have delay'd that vi&s;it, for &s;ome days, thereby to give &s;ome proof of his obedience. He took him to task &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly, as that the young Beau might have been per&s;waded, to re|flect as &s;eriou&s;ly upon his own behaviour: He could not deny, but that he had paid her a vi&s;it, but the an&s;wer he gave, was, that with all due regard, to the Deference he ow'd him, he thought that he had no ju&s;t ground to reprove him; That Civility, and good Manners, had obliged him to go and tell her, that he was peremptorily di&s;charg'd to have any more Corre&s;pondence with her, and that having once had a kindne&s;s for her, he could do no le&s;s; for &s;he might have been ju&s;tly enrag'd again&s;t him, had he ca&s;t her off, without telling her why. That in the mean time, notwith&s;tanding the great de&s;ire he had, to give him full &s;atisfaction in that matter, yet he could not but own, that at the la&s;t vi&s;it, he had found her more charming than ever; that it troubled him much when he reflected upon his own weakne&s;s, but that all he could do in obedience to his Commands, was, to pray to God, for Strength and Re&s;olution to obey them. His Father under&s;tood well enough, the meaning of all this, and conceiving no great hopes of him, he left him, being much out of humour, at his an&s;wer. It was two or three days before the Son paid another vi&s;it to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, yet he &s;ent Letters to her every hour, and gave her notice, that next day, his Father was to give a &s;plendid Ball, and that &s;he mu&s;t not fail to be there; but that &s;he &s;hould come di&s;gui&s;ed in &s;uch and &s;uch a manner, that he might know her by her Garb. This Ball was the fine&s;t that had been &s;een of a long time, and all the Court was pre|&s;ent at it, but this young Lord could not as yet &s;ee his Mi&s;tre&s;s there, which put him out of humour, at a Lady, who would fain have had the &s;ame Intere&s;t in his affection, that the Actre&s;s had, and flattered her

&s;elf, with hopes, that if &s;he was &s;ucce&s;sful, his Father and his other Friends, would not find &s;o much fault with it: She began to rally him for being out of Hu|mour, that &s;he might thereby find a way, to bring about her own purpo&s;es, but he was not at lei&s;ure to give her an an&s;wer, for he &s;aw his Mi&s;tre&s;s come into the Ball that very moment. She was di&s;gui&s;ed in Man's dre&s;s, and he went immediately, and &s;poke to a young Prince&s;s, who was often engag'd in the Dance, that with the fir&s;t opportunity &s;he would plea&s;e to take out the young Spark, who was in &s;uch and &s;uch a dre&s;s, pointing to his Mi&s;tre&s;s. She promis'd to do it, and was as good as her word. <HI>Caius Garrulus,</HI> who had always an eye upon him, having ob&s;erv'd, that he look'd much to that &s;ide, where the new Masker was, and that immediately af|ter he had &s;poken to that Prince&s;s, he began to &s;u&s;pect what it was he had &s;aid to her, yet he would let no body know his Jealou&s;ie, till he &s;hould be fully a&s;&s;ured that he was in the right. And ob&s;erving this new Masker very narrowly, the more he viewed him, the more was he per&s;waded that it was his Ma&s;ter's Mi&s;tre&s;s. By this time there was one came and took out the young Prince&s;s to dance, and immediately after, &s;he took out this new Masker, which let <HI>Caius Garrulus</HI> clearly &s;ee that he was not mi&s;taken, for he knew &s;o well by her dancing, that it was &s;he, whom he &s;u&s;pect|ed, that tho' he had not had any other pre&s;umptions, that alone was &s;ufficient to confirm him in his &s;u&s;pici|ons.

of them re&s;olved to try calmer methods, for break|ing off this corre&s;pondence: they cau&s;ed to inform him, that &s;he was fal&s;e to him, and that others conver&s;ed familiarly with her; and unle&s;s he would give up conver&s;e with her, it was not &s;afe for his own Lady to bed with him. But though they endeavoured under hand, to rai&s;e all the jealou&s;ies imaginable, in his mind, yet he would believe no|thing. After the&s;e endeavours, his Father was af|fraid, le&s;t what he would have had his Son to believe, &s;hould prove true in good earne&s;t; and therefore he appointed a Woman, to attend his Sons Mi&s;tre&s;s; and to ob&s;erve her &s;o narrowly, that it &s;hould not be in her power to prove fal&s;e to his Son.</P>
<P>This young Lord was not the only Per&s;on, who was fond of the Women of Opera and Playhou&s;e, con|trary to the duty he ow'd both to him&s;elf, and to his Lady; there were many others who after his Exam|ple, did the &s;ame thing; and but too many who had done it before him.</P>
<P>But among all tho&s;e, who&s;e incon&s;ideratene&s;s is the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e is not one more inexcu&s;able, than a certain Duke, who was old enough, to have given greater Proofs of his prudence; be&s;ides that he had married a young Prince&s;s, of incomparable Beauty, and who de&s;erv'd beyond all compari&s;on, to have been more e&s;teemed, than all the Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, he could find among that &s;ort of Women. But no con&s;ideration would prevail with him, again&s;t lewd|ne&s;s, and he was not only unfaithful to her, but left her for good and all, and went to keep Hou&s;e with his new Mi&s;tre&s;s: Before this happened, his Father, who was one of the greate&s;t and riche&s;t Lords about the Court; had carried his Son's Lady, to his own Seat, in the Countrey, while her Hu&s;|band was in the Army. Her Mother who lov'd her mo&s;t tenderly, was loath to part with her, and had much rather &s;he had &s;tay'd with her, but could not
<PB N="24" REF="25">
obtain it; Yet her Daughter wrote to her &s;oon after, and be&s;ought her to imploy all her intere&s;t with the King; that he would plea&s;e to give orders that &s;he &s;hould return, for &s;he was not at all &s;afe, with her Father in Law who had &s;poken to her of Amours, not|with&s;tanding her relation to him; and that he had &s;poken &s;o very earne&s;tly, that no time mu&s;t be lo&s;t; if &s;he had any concern for her honour, and the peace of her mind. It is not certain if all this was literally true, or if it was only concerted, between the Mo|ther and the Daughter, to get her brought out of that Countrey, where her Father in Law dwelt, and of which &s;he was wearied, that &s;he might live with her Mother, who longed &s;o much for her company. Whatever was in this, the Lady having &s;poke of it to his Maje&s;ty, obtained an order to the Dukes Fa|ther, to &s;end his Daughter in Law back to <HI>Paris.</HI> He was enraged again&s;t both of them, for the af|front which they had put upon him; and therefore though he ought to have been the fir&s;t, who &s;hould have reproved his Son for conver&s;ing with his new Mi&s;tre&s;s, which now began to appear; yet he was at no great pains, to di&s;&s;wade him from it; he al|ledg'd they had &s;erved him a very Scurvy trick, and he was glad to revenge him&s;elf by this connivance. But if he thought this a good way to be revenged of them, he had very &s;oon rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with it, for his Son became &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately in love with this new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, or rather he became &s;uch a very Fool, as when he knew that &s;he was big with Child, he left his Wife, and went and lived with her: and his Father having given him no great yearly revenue, when he married him (though he him&s;elf had 400000 Livers a Year, be&s;ides great Summs of Money in his Coffers, and not one Farthing of Debt,) he found him&s;elf &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, becau&s;e of the two Families he had to provide for, and the charges he had been at in the Camp; that he re&s;olved to do, what People will &s;carcely believe of one of his quality, that was, to
<PB N="25" REF="26">
live without Coach, and without that great number of Pages and Lackeys, that Men of his quality u&s;u|ally have about them, and thus he reduced all his expences for the Winter time, to a very &s;mall mat|ter; having only one Lackey for him&s;elf, and ano|ther for his Mi&s;tre&s;s; and the&s;e he put in gray Cloaths, that when he took a Hackney to go abroad, neither he nor they might be known; The Women Servants wereas few in number, as the Lackeys, &s;he had only a Chamber-maid and a Nur&s;e, and this la&s;t &s;erv'd with both hands, that is, &s;he was Servant of the Hou&s;e, and Nur&s;e at the &s;ame time. His Friends could bear no longer with his incon&s;ideratene&s;s, and this di&s;grace|ful way of living; they &s;poke to him of it, as a thing that would &s;tain his honour to &s;uch a degree, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him, ever to retrieve it, and that he might not be altogether confounded with &s;hame, as he ought to be for &s;uch Practi&s;es, they told him that this Woman had certainly bewitched him; that at lea&s;t they had rea&s;on to think &s;o; &s;ince it was &s;o unnatural a thing in him, to part with the mo&s;t lovely Prince&s;s in the World, and to keep hou&s;e with a beggarly Strumpet, who&s;e very Trade and Profe&s;&s;ion, was enough to make any body di&s;gu&s;t her, though &s;he was a Thou&s;and times more charm|ing in her Per&s;on than &s;he &s;eem'd to be. All the An|&s;wer he made them was, that they &s;poke &s;o of her, only becau&s;e they did not know her: But if they had conver&s;ed a little with her, they would &s;oon be of another mind; in this they could not agree with him, and having taken leave of him, without being able to per&s;wade him to alter his mea&s;ures, they were grieved that he continued &s;o ob&s;tinately to di&s;|grace him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When they found this, they cau&s;ed to &s;peak under|hand to the Woman her &s;elf, and threatn'd, that they would have recour&s;e to Royal Authority, to have her &s;hut up in a Convent, or in &s;ome Pri&s;on, if &s;he would not even per&s;wade the Duke to part with
<PB N="26" REF="27">
her. One in her condition could not be well plea&s;ed with &s;uch a propo&s;al, and it quite confounded her. She knew that tho&s;e threatnings were not groundle&s;s, for &s;he had known a Woman kept in Pri&s;on Seven or Eight Years, becau&s;e &s;he had been Mi&s;tre&s;s to the Count <HI>D'Harcourt,</HI> whom we have already &s;poken of. And therefore being re&s;olved to prevent &s;o great a mi&s;chief, &s;he promi&s;ed to do all that was in her power, to &s;atisfy them; and &s;he was as good as her word, for that very day after &s;he had on &s;et purpo&s;e, made a &s;how of melancholy to the Duke; &s;he told him that &s;he could not any longer conver&s;e with him, as hitherto &s;he had done; becau&s;e her con&s;cience re|proached her continually with her guilt, and repre|&s;ented to her every moment, that &s;he only was the cau&s;e that he abandoned his Lady the Dutche&s;s; and that every body blamed her for it, as no doubt &s;he de&s;erved to be, in&s;omuch that was there nothing but that one con&s;ideration, &s;he was obliged to tell him, that he mu&s;t re&s;olve to break up with her, &s;ince their conver&s;e was equally &s;hameful, and &s;inful to them both. The Duke was &s;urpri&s;ed at a di&s;cour&s;e which he &s;o little expected; but having &s;till the more e&s;teem of her upon this very account; becau&s;e the two things &s;he made u&s;e of as a pretence for this di|vorce, are agreeable to a Lover, that is his own in|tere&s;t and the virtue of the Per&s;on he loves; he did all he could to make her change her thoughts, but the fears of a Pri&s;on made her deaf to all his rea&s;ons and to all his care&s;&s;es; &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in her re&s;olution to give over all conver&s;e with him, and knowing nothing could more prevail with him to cau&s;e him to reflect upon his pa&s;t conduct, than his own Lady's charming Beauty, which was indeed incomparably above hers, &s;he told him that if &s;he was as beautiful as his Lady, and if his Lady had nothing more charming about her than &s;he had, &s;he would not think it &s;trange that he &s;hould for&s;ake her, and live with her; but being obliged to confe&s;s, that all the ad|vantage
<PB N="27" REF="28">
was upon his Ladies &s;ide, &s;he could not &s;uffer any longer, that he &s;hould be called a Man of &s;o ill a ta&s;te; as to choo&s;e the wor&s;e, and to for&s;ake the better. He wou'd fain have per&s;waded her, that only her mo|de&s;ty made her &s;peak &s;o of her&s;elf, that if his thoughts were asked in that matter, he would &s;oon tell ju&s;t the contrary, that he was as capable as any other to judge of their Beauties, having conver&s;ed &s;o much with her. But his Mi&s;tre&s;s finding how he an|&s;wered her, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible to make him gain&s;ay any thing of all this, &s;he betook her&s;elf to her fir&s;t Argument; that her Con&s;cience would not allow her to conver&s;e any longer with him.</P>
<P>The Duke con&s;idered all the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, as the effect of &s;ome &s;ecret di&s;content, that had put her in|to an ill humour; and that he might bring her back to her ordinary Gaiety, he offer'd her &s;ome Pre&s;ents, but &s;he refus'd them generou&s;ly, and as the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;&s;ed Per&s;on in the World. In the mean time &s;he gave notice to tho&s;e who had threatned her, that &s;he was u&s;ing her utmo&s;t endeavours to &s;atisfie them, but if they were de&s;irous that &s;he &s;hould &s;uc|ceed, it was needful they &s;hould do &s;omething upon their parts. They be&s;tirred them&s;elves immediate|ly, knowing that it is be&s;t to &s;trike the Iron while it is hot; and they came a purpo&s;e to wait on the Duke. He would have re&s;i&s;ted all the Batteries, they could have rai&s;ed again&s;t him, had they been alone; but his Mi&s;tre&s;s treating him with &s;o much Indifference, and like a Woman who was ab&s;olutely re&s;olv'd, to abandon her former Vices; he told them that there needed no more Importunities, for he was re&s;olved to give them full &s;atisfaction: But if they would know the true rea&s;on, why he re&s;olv'd &s;o; it was becau&s;e his Mi&s;tre&s;s had determin'd him in it; &s;he who alone had a more ab&s;olute Empire over him, than it was po&s;&s;ible for all of them to have, when they were united together; that he chearfully and frankly own'd &s;o much to them, hoping,
<PB N="28" REF="29">
that for their parts, they would al&s;o acknowledge that &s;he was a much worthier Per&s;on than he could expre&s;s: an evident Proof of which was, that &s;he was fully re&s;olved, to bid adieu to all &s;orts of Intrigues and Amours; a thing very unu&s;ual for Women, af|ter they have once been accu&s;tomed to tho&s;e Plea&s;ures. But for her, he told them, that he had &s;o good an opinion of her, he could be &s;urety for her, &s;he &s;hould never return to them, that at lea&s;t he would comfort him&s;elf, with tho&s;e thoughts of her. His Friends did not trouble them&s;elves, to di&s;pute this matter with him, nor were they &s;uch fools as to inform him, how much they had frighted her with their threatnings, they thought it enough, that they had brought him to their own Terms, and it was all one to them, by what means &s;oever it was done; the only thing they de&s;ired was, how to bring the matter to an happy I&s;&s;ue, now that it was &s;o well begun. They went to his Ladies Parents, and de&s;i|red, they might concurr with them in reconciling them together. But the Dutche&s;s's Mother, (who after &s;he had once taken back her Daughter to her hou&s;e, could never re&s;olve to part with her) told them re&s;olutely that &s;he would never con&s;ent to it. The Dukes Father gave them much the &s;ame An|&s;wer, for he continued to be extreamly angry, at what the young Prince&s;s had &s;aid of him. But, as Men ordinarily yield &s;ooner to Rea&s;on than Women do, he was at la&s;t prevail'd with, but upon condi|tion, that when his Daughter in Law &s;hould be re|concil'd to her Husband, &s;he &s;hould not &s;ee her Mother any more. This was to throw Oyl into the Flame, and &s;erv'd only to provoke the Ladies In|dignation, &s;o that &s;he with&s;tood their Reconcile|ment more than ever. The Prince her Husband, was much wi&s;er and more rea&s;onable than &s;he was: He told her that by the Laws both of God and Man; they were oblig'd to contribute their endeavours for reconciling Husband and Wife; even though they
<PB N="29" REF="30">
had but &s;mall hopes to &s;ucceed in it: But that in this ca&s;e &s;he was much more oblig'd to it, than o|thers were; becau&s;e it was the Concern of her Son in law, and her Daughter. But for all this, &s;he continued ob&s;tinate, and &s;he had &s;uch an A&s;cendant over him, that he us'd to do nothing but what &s;he was pleas'd with, it was at la&s;t found nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak to the King of it.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty was of the Fathers opinion, and thought that in procuring &s;uch an Agreement, they ought not to &s;tand upon Punctilios; and therefore order'd the Dutche&s;s to follow her Husbands Ad|vice.</P>
<P>The Condition propos'd by her Son in law's Father, that &s;he &s;hould not &s;ee her Daughter, was qualified, and &s;he was allow'd to &s;ee her &s;ometimes, but not above twice a Week, le&s;t the Dukes Father &s;hould take it ami&s;s. It went much again&s;t the Ladies Stomach, that they &s;hould &s;et bounds to the Kind|ne&s;s &s;he had for her Daughter; and therefore &s;he propos'd, that if &s;he was not to &s;ee her Daughter but twice a Week; then her Son in law's Father, &s;hould not be allow'd to &s;ee her at all, and much le&s;s that they &s;hould live in the &s;ame Hou&s;e. They found out al&s;o a Medium for this, which was that he might &s;ee her, as often as his Son would allow him; and they told the Lady, that her Son in law, was more concerned than &s;he was, that his Father &s;hould not &s;ee her Daughter; if all was true, that was &s;aid of him. After all the&s;e things were con|certed, nothing remain'd, but to know, what the Duke would do with his Mi&s;tre&s;s and his Child; and that he would pitch upon a day for being fully recon|ciled to his Dutche&s;s. As to the fir&s;t, he promis'd to allow them a Pen&s;ion, which perhaps he has not been over careful to perform; yet I will not vouch this for a Truth; but becau&s;e he was then as pa&s;&s;io|nately in love with her as ever, I may pre&s;ume, he was prodigal enough of his Promi&s;es, but perhaps, he
<PB N="30" REF="31">
has been as &s;paring in performing them; for Lovers ea&s;ily forget their Promi&s;es, when they are not any more to &s;ee the Per&s;on, to whom they are made. As to the other matter, he made no difficulty in it; the day was appointed, and there was a new Mar|riage &s;olemniz'd. Before he went to Bed with his Wife, their Parents paid their Compliments to them, as if they had been, but a new married Couple: And their other Friends, after their example, did the &s;ame; in fine, they were both together, carried to the Opera, and to other publick places, that tho&s;e who had heard of their Divorce, might &s;ee that the greate&s;t Follies do not la&s;t always.</P>
<P>One would think, that &s;uch an example as this, might have had, a good Influence, upon tho&s;e, who werefallen into the &s;ame fren&s;y, that is upon tho&s;e, who made but &s;mall account of their Wives, for the &s;ake of the&s;e naughty Creatures; but we have not hitherto &s;een, any good that it hath done to a cer|tain Duke, who though he has not as yet parted with his Wife, as the other did; yet, he lives not in much better Terms with her; one of the&s;e un|happy Women of the Playhou&s;e, having by &s;ome means engaged his Affections. has &s;o bewitchd him, that of a long time, he has had no Conver&s;e with his Wife; and vet &s;he's very young, and which is more, &s;he's a Lady of great Vertue, which is &s;o valuable an Accompli&s;hment, yea, and &s;o &s;ingular in this Age, as to de&s;erve that a Husband &s;hould e&s;teem it much more than he does.</P>
<P>'Tis true, &s;he is not &s;o great a beauty, as is an Aunt of her Husbands, who yet has not been much more fortunate, though &s;he be a Lady of great Vir|tue, as well as her Neice. This Lady was married to a Per&s;on of Honour, and a Man of as good Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e as was about the Court, which is another rea&s;on why he &s;hould have u&s;ed her well; for the more a Man has of Honour and true Sen&s;e, the more will he endeavour to acquit him&s;elf of his Duty. But he was &s;o de&s;perately in Love with a young Lady, who
<PB N="31" REF="32">
is al&s;o of great vertue, and is at this time Superiour of the Maids of St. <HI>Marie de Chaliot,</HI> that he could not open his eyes, to &s;ee how happy he might have been in his own Wife. And he did even much wor&s;e, than did the two Dukes I la&s;t &s;poke of, for he did not &s;o much as bed with her, the fir&s;t Night of the Marriage: And if we will believe the accounts we have at Court, he &s;uffered her to continue always a Maid, though they liv'd a long time together, and though there was never any publick breach between them. His Father, who was al&s;o a Man of good Sen&s;e, and &s;o far from approving his want of affection to this Lady, that he was extreamly vexed at it, when he perceived it, and told him his thought of it, very freely; and finding the Arguments he made u&s;e of, made him nothing the wi&s;er Man, he be thought him&s;elf of others, and try'd if perhaps they would be of greater force: He told him, that laying a&s;ide the authority of a Father, he would now only advi&s;e him as his true Friend, and that all he had to &s;ay to him, was, that all the Court look'd upon his Wife, as a very agreeable Lady, and that among them who e&s;teem'd her much, &s;he might perhaps find one whom &s;he would think worthy of her Affection, that the be&s;t means how to prevent that, was for him to per|form the duty of a Husband to her, otherwi&s;e per|haps another might &s;upply his place. This advice was &s;ound and whol&s;ome, but as this young Gentle|man had &s;hut his Eyes, and would not take notice of his Lady's true worth, &s;o he &s;topt his Ears at his Father's Rea&s;ons, and held on his cour&s;e, without ever troubling him&s;elf, with the thoughts of his future de&s;tiny. Yet the Horo&s;cope, which his Father had ca&s;t for him, prov'd fal&s;e, for there was never a Lady at Court, made her &s;elf be le&s;s talk'd of than &s;he did However, her Husband died, and &s;he kept for a &s;econd Husband, that, which is &s;o much valued in a Bride. She was reputed a Widow, but was truly a Maid when &s;he was married the &s;econd time
<PB N="32" REF="33">
And as if &s;he had been born under the &s;trange&s;t Planet that ever was. 'Tis generally believed that this &s;e|cond Husband, has not as yet made her change her condition. He was one of the hand&s;ome&s;t men in <HI>France,</HI> yet altogether unfit for the Marriage Bed; and therefore his fir&s;t Wife did not care much to dwell with him, though there was never any publick rupture between them, and though &s;he might have made a very good figure at Court too: But &s;he cho&s;e rather to leave him there alone, and to revenge her &s;elf of her hard fate, upon the Harts, and other wild Bea&s;ts, with whom &s;he made War &s;o long as &s;he liv'd. 'Tis true, that when &s;he was a dying, &s;he made a Will in his Favours, which would &s;eem to import quite other things, than what I have been ju&s;t now alledging; for it's &s;eld<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m that a Wife will be &s;o obliging to a Husband, unle&s;s &s;he have fir&s;t receiv'd of his Favours: But all Women are not of the &s;ame humour, and it mu&s;t be &s;aid to the advantage of this Lady, that as to this matter, &s;he was le&s;s concern'd, and much more mode&s;t, than many others are. Hunting was that which &s;he took greate&s;t Plea&s;ure in, and becau&s;e her Husband treated her always very kindly, &s;ave, in that, which mo&s;t of other Women think the chief and e&s;&s;ential part of a Husband's kindne&s;s. It &s;eems &s;he made no great account of it; And &s;he had rather, that her Husband &s;hould enjoy her e&s;tate, than &s;ome of her Relations, whom &s;he did not much e&s;teem. She gave the tru&s;t of her Will, to the Duke <HI>De Le&s;|deguires,</HI> but he being &s;urpri&s;ed with a &s;udden Death, when he was lea&s;t thinking of it, and when he had lived but to half the Age, that by the cour&s;e of Na|ture he might have done; it created much trouble afterwards to her Husband. Yet this was a &s;ea|&s;onable relief to him, and he had much need of it, to repair the breaches he had made in his own e&s;tate, in the time he had been at Court.</P>
<P>As the Court is the place of the World, where the greate&s;t number of extraordinary things fall out:

&s;o about the &s;ame time, that the terms of the Re|conciliation (which I &s;poke of) were agreed to; There was one thing happened that did not &s;ound well, for one of the principal Actors in it, and it has made People have but an ill Opinion of a Man, whom we now bring upon the Stage.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t know then, that among other methods which the King had taken, to rai&s;e Money, for maintaining the War, he had publi&s;h'd an Edict, for the &s;ale of &s;ome Governments, within the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">art of the Kingdom; and there was more need of Money, for the purcha&s;e of them, than either of Service or Merit.

<P>The Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> being dead, this <HI>d' Au|gincourt,</HI> who had the honour to be known to the King, becau&s;e he had &s;o very often, carry'd this Mi|ni&s;ter<HI>'s Portofolio,</HI> to the Door of his Maje&s;ties Clo&s;et; having asked and obtained a &s;ecret audience, told him, that he thought it his Duty to adverti&s;e him of one thing, which his Maje&s;ty knew nothing of before; which was, that his Maje&s;ty had always be|lieved that all the projects which the late Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> had pre&s;ented to him, were of his own con|trivance, but it was far from being &s;o, and that that Mini&s;ter had always had recour&s;e to him, when he had any thing to do of Con&s;equence: That it was he who had projected &s;uch and &s;uch things, and that the Marquis <HI>de Louvois</HI> was never able of him&s;elf, to do any thing to purpo&s;e; that his undertakings at <HI>Maintenon,</HI> were a &s;ufficient proof of this, that at that place he had committed a great many faults, which he had never fallen into, had he but followed his advice, that he was ready to di&s;cover the&s;e faults and over&s;ights to his Maje&s;ty, who, becau&s;e of his great skill in Fortification, would &s;oon be convinced, that what he &s;aid was true. The King who is truly skilful in the&s;e things, and perhaps much more &s;o, than many People believe of him, finding that he offer'd to prove to a demon&s;tration all the over&s;ights, which he charg'd his late Mini&s;ter with, gave him, upon that Account a fuller hearing than otherways he would have done. <HI>D' Augincourt</HI> having &s;aid whatever he thought fit for his own advantage, and the King knowing that in &s;ome things he was in the right, though in &s;ome al&s;o he was mi&s;taken; was &s;o far from telling him, that he did not approve of his ingrati|tude to his Ma&s;ter, to whom he had been obliged of his E&s;tate, that though the&s;e were his Sentiments,
<PB N="35" REF="36">
yet on the contrary he told him, that he would con|tinue the Pen&s;ion to him, which he had given him upon the Marquis <HI>D' Louvois</HI>'s recommendation: <HI>D' Augincourt,</HI> though he was in &s;ome mea&s;ure plea|&s;ed with the Kings bounty, becau&s;e the cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nuing of the Pen&s;ion, was a Proof that his Maje&s;ty ap|proved of what he had &s;aid, yet he was not altoge|ther &s;atisfied, for he had flattered him&s;elf, with the hopes of a much greater reward; and that his Ma|je&s;ty would make u&s;e of him, in his &s;ecret affairs, of which he pretended to have the Key; and expect|ing that the King would be&s;tow the late Marquis <HI>D'Louvois</HI> place upon him, he continued as often as he could find occa&s;ion, to &s;peak all the ill of him he could think of. 'Tis impo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ble for one to behave him&s;elf after this manner at Court, but that a Mini|&s;ter &s;hall have notice of it, and the Marquis <HI>D'Bar|bi&s;eux</HI> was &s;oon adverti&s;ed of it, and he was &s;truck to the very Heart with it; e&s;pecially when he knew that the King had granted him his Pen&s;ion; by which he under&s;tood that his Maje&s;ty believed ma|ny of the things which he had alledged again&s;t his Fathers Memory. The&s;e thoughts galled him &s;o much, that he re&s;olved to be revenged on him, and meeting with him that very day, as he was going to the Kings Appartments, he was not Ma&s;ter enough of his Pa&s;&s;ions, for at fir&s;t &s;ight he gave him very har&s;h Language as he well de&s;erved, but <HI>D' Augincourt</HI> who flattered him&s;elf, that &s;ince the King had heard him &s;o favourably, he would cer|tainly grant him the honour of his Protection, an|&s;wered him with as much in&s;olence, as if he had never been his Fathers dome&s;tick. This in&s;olent behaviour rai&s;ed the Marquis <HI>D'Barbi&s;eux</HI>'s pa&s;&s;ion to &s;uch a height, that he him&s;elf forgot the re&s;pect he owed to the place he was in; he took him by the Cravate and would have certainly &s;trangled him, had not his Friends put him in mind, that the King would be highly offended at what he was doing. He yeilded
<PB N="36" REF="37">
to their rea&s;ons and went immediately to the King, and told him, that he came to beg his pardon, for &s;omething he had done in a &s;udden fit of pa&s;&s;ion; that his Maje&s;ty knew how unaccountable <HI>D' Augincourts</HI> ingratitude was, towards his Father, tho' it was to him he owed all he had; that he had met with him accidentally at the door of the Antichamber; and not being able to command his pa&s;&s;ion, he had offered &s;ome violence to him, of which he humbly ac|knowledged him&s;elf guilty, that tho' his pa&s;&s;ion la&s;ted but a moment, becau&s;e he had reflected upon it, yet he did not pretend to be excu&s;able upon that account, and therefore he would &s;ubmit to all the puni&s;h|ments, that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould order for him, only he be&s;ought him to con&s;ider how natural it was for a Son, to be &s;en&s;ibly t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ched with every thing that concerned his Fathers Honour. The King having heard him calmly, an&s;wered him, that it was good for him that he had &s;o &s;oon reflected upon his fault, and had put a &s;top to the cour&s;e of his pa&s;&s;ion; but that he had done better if he had reflected &s;ooner upon it, &s;o as not to have committed it, that yet he would pardon him upon the account of what a Son ow'd to his Father; but upon condition always, that he &s;hould never again fall into the like enormity. The Marquis <HI>De Barbi&s;eux</HI> acted like a wi&s;e man, thus to prevent the other in addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the King; for &s;carcely had he done it, when <HI>D' Augincourt</HI> pre&s;ented him&s;elf before his Maje&s;ty, and demanded ju&s;tice for the ill treatment he had met with from his Mini&s;ter. The King told him he &s;hould have it, but that he would fir&s;t examine how the matter went; but &s;eeing he had once promi&s;ed to pardon the Mar|quis <HI>D' Barbi&s;eux,</HI> all the &s;atisfaction <HI>D' Augincourt</HI> could ever obtain, was that his Maje&s;ty told him, he had given him &s;uch a reprimand as was proper, and that he would be wi&s;er in time coming, he told him al&s;o, that when one had been a menial Servant to a Man, as he had been to the Marquis <HI>D'Louvois,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="38">
he ought to behave him&s;elf re&s;pectfully towards his Children.</P>
<P><HI>D'Augincourt</HI> might have learned from this, to have been wi&s;er afterwards, than to contend with one that was above him, yet never thinking that the &s;ame accident might befall him, if he fell again into the &s;ame Errour; he no &s;ooner formed the de&s;ign of carrying the Government of <HI>Rue</HI> again&s;t the Duke <HI>D'Elbeuf,</HI> but he gave in a memoir again&s;t him to the King, which contained that this Prince, had been &s;everal times guilty of extortioning the People, within the bounds of his Government of <HI>Piccardy</HI> and <HI>Artois,</HI> and that his Maje&s;ty might give credit to this, he offered to prove it, &s;o &s;oon as he was commanded to do it: the King who knew that this Prince had &s;ome good qualities, for which he is de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed, was troubled to &s;ee him &s;tain'd with &s;o black an ac|cu&s;ation, as that of extortion is. Not but that he knew well enough, that accu&s;ations are not always true; he had &s;een abundance of in&s;tances in his own time, where the Accu&s;ations fell back upon the Heads of the Accu&s;ers; as it happened to <HI>Courbier</HI> and &s;ome others. But becau&s;e this memoir was &s;o conceived, as to have all the appearances of truth, the King knew not well what to &s;ay of it, and would not &s;o much as &s;peak of it; but the Duke <HI>D'Elbeuf,</HI> finding that the Farmers of the Kings revenues, asked much more for the Government of <HI>Rue,</HI> than it was worth, becau&s;e <HI>D'Augincourt</HI> had offered them Money, he had recour&s;e to the King that he might not fall into their Hands.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty, who remembred what the other had &s;aid to his di&s;advantage, in&s;tead of an&s;wering him, &s;o obligingly as he u&s;ed to do, told him only, that he would con&s;ider of it. The Duke who knew his Maje&s;ties humour, which is to be kind and obliging, even to Per&s;ons of far le&s;s quality than he concluded pre&s;ently from this an&s;wer, that &s;ome per&s;on had done him an ill office; He did all he cou'd,
<PB N="38" REF="39">
for &s;ome days, to di&s;cover who it might be, and knowing that <HI>D'Augincourt,</HI> had an Eye upon the <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Rue,</HI> he was almo&s;t per&s;waded that he was the Man. His Ingratitude to his late Ma&s;ter, was enough to make him entertain the&s;e thoughts of him, yet that he might be more a&s;&s;ur'd of it, he &s;poke again to the King, and begg'd to know, if he had as yet con&s;idered of his Reque&s;t, as he had promi&s;ed to do: His Maje&s;ty told him, that he had thought of it, but it could not be granted him, for &s;ome Rea&s;ons which he was unwilling to tell him. The Duke <HI>D'Elbeuf,</HI> was yet more &s;urprized at this An&s;wer, than he was at the fir&s;t, and was more per|&s;waded than ever, that the King was not well plea&s;ed with him, and therefore he &s;upplicated His Maje&s;ty, with the greate&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s, that he would be graci|ou&s;ly plea&s;ed to tell him what it was, that he had to lay to his Charge. His Maje&s;ty an&s;wered him, that he had re&s;olved to conceal it from him, that thereby he might &s;ave him the trouble, which the know|ledge of it would certainly give him. But &s;ince he was &s;o very earne&s;t to know it, he would tell him plainly, that he had received a Memoir a|gain&s;t him, wherein he was accus'd, of extortion|ing the People who lived under his Juri&s;diction. 'Tis true the Duke <HI>D'Elbeuf,</HI> who is not very rich, and who loves to live great, and therefore had need to make the be&s;t advantage of every thing; had us'd his utmo&s;t Skill and Indu&s;try, in looking narrowly after his Affairs, &s;o that nothing that did of right belong to him, could e&s;cape him; but how much &s;oever he look'd after his own Intere&s;t, yet he had never been an Extortioner; and he could not endure that he &s;hould be unju&s;tly accu&s;ed of it: And therefore, he reque&s;ted His Maje&s;ty, that In|quiry &s;hould be made into it. He told him that he who was but a Young man, had ra&s;hly done &s;ome things in his time, which his Maje&s;ty could not approve of, that he mo&s;t humbly begg'd pardon
<PB N="39" REF="40">
for them, as he had al&s;o done, when he was fir&s;t charged with them; but that he was content to lo&s;e his Head, if ever he was in the lea&s;t guilty of what was now laid to his Charge. The King who was prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an Opinion, that <HI>D'Au|gincourt</HI> would never have dared, to have given him the Memoir, if he had not been well a&s;&s;ured, that what it contain'd was true; e&s;pecially &s;ince he lived in the Neighbourhood, where he pretended that the Duke had been guilty of the Extortions; an&s;wered him, that he would not at all advi&s;e him, to &s;earch this matter to the bottom, lea&s;t perhaps it might prove more to his hurt than he expected, and that at lea&s;t it was probable it would prove &s;o. This an&s;wer afflicted him yet more, than any of the former An&s;wers had done; and therefore he continued to &s;olicit His Maje&s;ty, that he would be plea&s;ed to allow him to ju&s;tify him|&s;elf. The King turned away from him, to &s;peak to another Per&s;on of Quality, to whom he had &s;omething to &s;ay: And the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI> going out with an heart full of Sorrow, re&s;olved to em|ploy all his own and his friends Intere&s;ts, that he might be allowed to clear him&s;elf of this Calumny. As he went out of the Antichamber, he found <HI>D'Au|gincourt</HI> with one of his Friends at the door of the Guard-hall, he took him a&s;ide, to &s;peak to him in private. <HI>D'Augincourt</HI> left his friend alone, and the Duke asked him, if perhaps he was not the Man, who had given the King a certain Memoir, of which his Maje&s;ty had been ju&s;t now &s;peaking to him? <HI>D'Augincourt</HI> who had &s;o much Impudence as to &s;peak ill of his dead Ma&s;ter, by who&s;e fa|vour it was, that he had acquired all that he was worth; was impudent enough to own in the Dukes face, that he was the very Man; and which was more, he told him that he had promi&s;ed to the King, to make good every thing that was in that Memoir, and that e're it was long, he would
<PB N="40" REF="41">
be as good as his word. The Duke was &s;o wi&s;e, as not to do as the Marquis <HI>de Barbi&s;ieux</HI> had done, when he fell into his hands. But in&s;tead of that, he contented him&s;elf to tell him, that he was &s;atisfied to know, how far his Impudence had carried him, that he might come to be treated as he de&s;erv'd, at another time, and in another place; that he would take notice of him, and at la&s;t he threaten'd him, that he would cau&s;e him to be cudgelled to death for a Ra&s;cal as he was. <HI>D'Augincourt</HI> went and complain'd to the King, and demanded Ju&s;tice of him. The King told him, he was ready to do him Ju&s;tice, but he mu&s;t fir&s;t prove what he had alledged again&s;t the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf;</HI> who expre&s;ly denied all that he had charged him with: And if he had calumniated him without ground, then the Duke had much more rea&s;on to demand Ju&s;tice than he had. The Duke re|turn'd to wait upon the King, and reque&s;ted him to appoint Judges, to enquire into that matter; for if that were not done, his Reputation &s;hou'd be brought into que&s;tion, and that it was not ju&s;t, that in prejudice of his Innocence any credit &s;hould be given, to &s;uch a lying Wretch as <HI>D'Augincourt:</HI> He told him at the &s;ame time, the de&s;igns that <HI>D'Augincourt</HI> had upon the Government of <HI>Rue,</HI> and that he had taken this method of calumniating him, fearing lea&s;t other|wi&s;e, he &s;hould not be able to carry it again&s;t him. The King who is extreamly prudent and judicious, began to perceive how the matter &s;tood, as &s;oon as he heard this; and he gue&s;s'd, that Jealou&s;ie and intere&s;t, had made <HI>D'Augincourt</HI> do what he had done; and therefore he allowed that the Duke &s;hould clear him&s;elf; and promi&s;ed to name Judges for that Affair: and which was more, he told him, that if he found <HI>D'Augincourt</HI> had accu&s;ed him fal&s;ly, he &s;hould cau&s;e to inflict any Puni&s;hment upon him, that the Duke thought fit. But the Judges were not named, for &s;ome time
<PB N="41" REF="42">
after; in&s;omuch that now, when I am writing the&s;e <HI>Memoirs;</HI> this Affair is not as yet ended.</P>
<P>The young <HI>Beaus</HI> of the Court; were become &s;o profligate, that many lewd Women, came to be in vogue among them; and among the re&s;t, the Women of the Playhou&s;e and the Opera: But there were &s;ome others be&s;ides them, who came to be as much e&s;teemed as they were; and e&s;pecially one <HI>Ma|demoi&s;elle Chambonneau,</HI> the Daughter of a Gentle|man of <HI>Poiton,</HI> who finding her &s;elf every way fit|ted for Amours, thought it was pity, to bury &s;o good Qualities, in an ob&s;cure Country place; and therefore, &s;he came to <HI>Paris,</HI> where &s;he might &s;et them forth; in the view of the fine&s;t City, and of the fine&s;t Court in the World. Prince <HI>Philip,</HI> was one of her fir&s;t Admirers; but he dy|ing &s;oon after, there were others &s;ucceeded him, who were fully equal to him, both for Per&s;onal Worth and Quality, &s;o that &s;he was no loo&s;er by the Change. But before I &s;ay any more of her, I beg leave to give an account of a &s;illy Imper|tinence of the Mar&s;hal <HI>de Milleraies</HI> Lady, who is the mo&s;t whim&s;ical Woman in the World, as to what concerns Quality.</P>
<P>This Prince had not lived a very Chri&s;tian Life, at lea&s;t, &s;o far as appeared to the View of the World: And there was a devout Lady, who &s;oon after his Death, &s;aid in a publick Company, where the Mar&s;hal's Lady was; that his Salvation was much to be doubted of, con&s;idering how irreli|giou&s;ly he had lived; that many People had been Witne&s;&s;es of his Debaucheries, but none had ever heard of his Repentance. The Mar&s;hal's Lady an&s;wered, that &s;he confe&s;&s;ed that all that was true; but that God was merciful, e&s;pecially to a Per&s;on of Prince <HI>Philip</HI>'s Quality; and that &s;ince God was good to all Mankind, he would be much more &s;o, to &s;uch a Man as he was; and when it came to the damning of a Per&s;on of &s;o great
<PB N="42" REF="43">
Quality, God would think twice upon it before he did it: The Lady to whom &s;he made this An&s;wer, would not let her pa&s;s with it, though &s;he knew her weak &s;ide, and that &s;he was but a magotty Woman about the&s;e things, and therefore &s;he could not hope for much &s;atisfaction, from any thing &s;he could &s;ay about them.</P>
<P>But to return to my Subject, <HI>Madam Cham|bonneau,</HI> being the Widow of a Per&s;on of &s;uch a Character, and being married to a &s;econd Hus|band, who is yet more of it, all the young People of Quality re&s;orted to her Hou&s;e. Her new Hus|band was not at all jealous of her, and allow'd her to &s;ee every body. And &s;he got a good num|ber of young Favourites about her, out of which &s;he was &s;ure to make a choice of &s;uch Debauchees as were mo&s;t agreeable to her humour; e&s;pecially the Count <HI>de Don&s;i,</HI> elde&s;t &s;on to the Duke <HI>de Nevers,</HI> a Man of as odd a Temper as his Father is; and to give his Character in one Word, I need only &s;ay, that he has all the Vices of the <HI>Manchinies,</HI> yea, and &s;urpa&s;&s;es them in two things, that are ex|treamly &s;hameful in any man; but e&s;pecially in a Per&s;on of his Quality. He can &s;carce &s;peak a word without adding the Name of God to it, and Bla&s;phemes as often as he &s;peaks. And as for Drinking, it would &s;eem that in what place &s;oe|ver he is, <HI>Bacchus</HI> had &s;et up his Throne, and kept Court there: Yet the&s;e are the two great Quali|ties he boa&s;ts mo&s;t of, whereas he ought rather to con&s;ider them, as very dangerous Di&s;tempers; for in my opinion, he who is become a Slave, to two &s;uch di&s;graceful Vices, may ju&s;tly look up|on him&s;elf, as the mo&s;t wretched and mi&s;erable of all Mortals. Notwith&s;tanding all this, he is &s;o very comely and hand&s;ome in his Per&s;on, that were he as &s;ound in the Head, as he is well &s;hap'd in the Body, we might ea&s;ily excu&s;e not only this <HI>Mad. Chambonneau,</HI> but many others; who after her
<PB N="43" REF="44">
Example, &s;hould &s;how &s;ome Affection for him&punc;</P>
<P>This Counts Father, (who is &s;ordidly penurious in &s;ome things, tho' in others he &s;eems rather to be prodigal) did not allow him &s;o much as one far|thing of Money, which was the rea&s;on, that he had neither Servants nor Equipage. Perhaps he would have had him to go to the Market as he did him&s;elf; for we mu&s;t know, that when the humour takes him, he makes no &s;cruple to go thither: And 'tis pretty odd to &s;ee a Knight of the Holy Gho&s;t with his blew Ribband, in a Publick Market, asking a Fruit woman, how &s;he &s;ells her Fruit and her Carrots. There was a man came once, and told <HI>Mon&s;ieur Baville</HI> Intendant of <HI>Lan|guedoc,</HI> that he was &s;een doing &s;o in the publick Market at <HI>Montpellier,</HI> but he could not tell his Name, for he that had &s;een him, did not know him; he &s;ent immediately to all parts of the Town, to know who this Knight of the Holy Gho&s;t might be, that was come thither; and &s;o &s;oon as he knew that it was the Duke <HI>de Nevers,</HI> he went to pay him a Vi&s;it; and that he might engage him to reflect upon his own Conduct, as unwor|thy of his Character; he told him, that he &s;hould not have known that he was in that Town, but that it had been told him, that he was &s;een in the Market, that when he fir&s;t heard of it, he could not beleive it, till it was confirm'd to him by &s;o many People, that at la&s;t he was forced to give credit to it, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;eem to be too incre|dulous. The Duke an&s;wered him, that he had gone from his Lodgings, with a de&s;ign to pay him a Vi&s;it, but that having thought it too early, and that he would not be up &s;o &s;oon; he had done after the Cu&s;tom of <HI>Italy,</HI> which allows Ma&s;ters to go them&s;elves, and buy whatever they have a mind to eat; that he knew it was not &s;o in <HI>France,</HI> but that for his part, he never &s;tood upon &s;uch &s;mall matters, &s;o that he might have the &s;atisfaction to
<PB N="44" REF="45">
have nothing upon his Table, but what did reli&s;h with him.</P>
<P>But this Man is of a &s;ingular humour in other things be&s;ides this, e&s;pecially in his way of Hou&s;e|keeping. For when he is not to have any Strangers at his Table, he gives fifty Sols a day for him&s;elf, and as much for his Lady, to the Steward of his Hou&s;e, who mu&s;t therewith provide victuals for them both; and as to his Servants, he gives Ten Sols for every one of them, &s;o that he is in no great hazard of being cheated; &s;ince the Steward can neither augment nor dimini&s;h the daily Allow|ance. By this means its only when he entertains Strangers, that any thing beyond ordinary is to be &s;een in his Hou&s;e, and it's then, that he u&s;es to go him&s;elf to the Market, which might be thought a &s;ure Mark of a penurious Humour: Were it not that there is one thing remarkable in his Hou&s;e, that is not to be found el&s;ewhere, and that is, that if a|nother Man have one Cook, and an Under-cook; This Duke has &s;ix, or at lea&s;t four of them; for he has an humour, that he will not &s;uffer that one Cook &s;hould meddle but with one thing: So that he, who has the charge of the Roa&s;t Meat, never med|dles with the Ragoo's, and he who has the charge of the Ragoo's, meddles not with the more dainty Di&s;hes; and &s;o of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>A Man of &s;o &s;ingular an humour as this is, could never allow his Son to live &s;uch a Life as he did; he had already quit his Hou&s;e, &s;o as not to lodge in it, and he thought it high time to give a check to his extravagant way of living; he &s;ent to him, and warn'd him not to &s;ee Mad. <HI>Chambonneau</HI> any more, or el&s;e he knew what remedies to find for his Di&s;tem|per. He was afraid either that he &s;hould run him|&s;elf into debt, by &s;pending too much with her, or that he &s;hould be &s;uch a Fool, as to marry her pri|vately, as was reported of him. He had rea&s;on to look upon him, as a Man that was capable of any+thing
<PB N="45" REF="46">
that was fooli&s;h and extravagant, though there had been no other ground for it, but only this, that he had taken upon him&s;elf the Title of a Duke, though it did not all belong to him, and which is yet wor&s;e, had no ground to hope that ever it &s;hould belong to him, for his Father's Patent is not for his Po&s;terity, but only for his own Life time. So that when he comes to die, his Fa|mily has done with that Title; as it happened not long ago to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Vieuville.</HI> By this, we may ea&s;ily judge of the Father's humour, for he married his Lady, when her Aunt, Madam <HI>de Monte&s;pan,</HI> was in greate&s;t favour with the King, and at her greate&s;t height; yet he neglected to have that Honour en&s;ur'd to his Po&s;terity and Family, tho' it would have co&s;t him nothing to obtain it, if he had but asked it.</P>
<P>However, the Count <HI>de Don&s;i,</HI> who had heard, that while his Father was a young Man, he had liv'd much after the &s;ame manner, that he did him&s;elf now while he was al&s;o young; and that he could not ju&s;tly challenge him, for copying after his example, an&s;wered the Gentleman whom his Father had &s;ent to him, that he could not think of leaving <HI>Paris,</HI> as he would have him do. The Duke procur'd a letter <HI>de Cachet</HI> from the King, for comitting him to the Ba&s;tile.</P>
<P>Mad. <HI>Chambonneau</HI> went the fir&s;t and &s;econd day after he was taken up, and wandered up and down about the Ca&s;tle, to try, if perhaps &s;he might &s;ee him upon the Terra&s;s, or in the Windows; but &s;he dar'd not adventure to go in, and inquire for him, for they had threatned to put her&s;elf in Pri&s;on, if &s;he &s;hould be found in a di&s;gui&s;e, offering to pay him a vi&s;it: But &s;he was &s;o much a <HI>Coquette,</HI> that in two or Three days, &s;he became indifferent, whether &s;he &s;hould ever &s;ee him again or no; &s;he troubled her&s;elf no more about him, but con&s;idered him as a dead Man, becau&s;e he was no more in a con|dition to do her &s;ervice. Only &s;he thought fit to keep &s;ome rules of decency with him, and there|fore
<PB N="46" REF="47">
&s;he wrote &s;ome Letters to him, and expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf as tenderly, as if &s;he had loved him as much as ever, and even imployed <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Soi&s;|&s;ons</HI> (who's conduct is not much approved of, by tho&s;e who are concerned in her Per&s;on and Intere&s;t) that &s;he might a&s;&s;ure him of it. <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> went twice or thrice to the Ba&s;tile to deliver her Commi&s;&s;ion, and it may be &s;he was glad of the opportunities, that &s;he might &s;ee him her &s;elf. But the Duke <HI>de Nevers,</HI> (who was jea|lous of her, and to whom the Governour of the Ca&s;tle, would not refu&s;e any favour, becau&s;e he ow'd his Fortune to Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> the Dukes Uncle,) prevailed &s;o far that &s;he was &s;topt at the Gate, and not &s;uffered to enter, as if it had been by order from his Maje&s;ty. This was a notable affront for this Prince&s;s; who tho' &s;he was warned of what was to befall her, yet could not believe that the Governour dar'd do &s;uch a thing, becau&s;e &s;he was grand Niece of the &s;ame Cardinal, to whom he had been Captain of the Guards.</P>
<P>But as he had learned from him, to make no great account of any &s;ort of People, but of tho&s;e who were rich and powerful; and &s;he being neither the one nor the other, becau&s;e of the many Di&s;a&s;ters, that had befallen her family, he got &s;oon over tho&s;e con&s;iderations, that &s;o he might gratify the Duke. She might have complained of this to the King, if &s;he dur&s;t have &s;poken to him, but his Maje&s;ty was far from having any e&s;teem for her, and he had already cau&s;ed notice to be given her, that if &s;he did not alter her conduct, he would be obliged to &s;end her orders, that would not at all plea&s;e her; and therefore &s;he had ra|ther put up the affront, and be &s;ilent, than by complaining, to put his Maje&s;ty in mind, that &s;he did not live as a Lady of her quality ought to do. Yet the King did not forget her &s;o &s;oon, he remembered her more than ever; now that the

Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> had married the Prince&s;s of <HI>Savoy.</HI> The honour that <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> had, to be of the &s;ame Family that the Prince&s;s is of, made him often reflect, how unworthy it was of her Character and Quality to live as &s;he did; and &s;eeing &s;he would not be reclaim'd, by what was &s;aid to her, either from the King, or from her Friends, he &s;ent her a Letter <HI>de Cachet,</HI> to de|part out of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Her Si&s;ter <HI>Mademoi&s;elle Carignan</HI> got al&s;o a &s;e|cret rebuke, though her conduct was not altoge|ther &s;o di&s;orderly as hers was; yet &s;he came to be talked of, as conver&s;ing too frequently with a certain Duke, who was married: The King there|fore &s;ent to her, and offered her an Apartment at <HI>Ver&s;ailles;</HI> upon condition that &s;he would take a Governe&s;s of his naming. She had one already, who was as old a Woman as any I know; and <HI>Mademoi&s;elle Carrignan</HI> took occa&s;ion from this, to excu&s;e her &s;elf, for not accepting the honour which his Maje&s;ty had de&s;igned for her, and &s;he told tho&s;e who &s;pake to her from his Maje&s;ty; that it would occa&s;ion the death of her old Go|verne&s;s, if &s;he &s;hould now put her a way, when &s;he had been &s;o long time with her; that it would look like a Tacite Accu&s;ation, that &s;he had not been &s;o careful as &s;he ought to have been of her Education; that in all appearance &s;he could not live long; and that &s;o &s;oon as &s;he was dead, there could be nothing which &s;he would &s;o much re|joyce at, as to make good u&s;e of the Favors, which his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to offer her. <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Carignan,</HI> having by this means got her &s;elf off, &s;he was very well plea&s;ed, that &s;he had thereby &s;hun'd the con&s;traint, under which &s;he &s;hould have been, had &s;he liv'd at <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI> She cho&s;e rather to keep her own little Court at the <HI>Hotel de Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> than to be one of tho&s;e, who make

up the &s;plendour at the Prince&s;&s;es Court: The good old Woman Madam <HI>de St. Martin</HI> who is her Governe&s;s, was extreamly well plea&s;ed, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the an&s;wer &s;he had made; in the mean time, the Duke was adverti&s;ed of this, and it was de&s;ired of him that he would take care, not to pay her &s;o many vi&s;its, as he u&s;ed to do; le&s;t the King &s;hould &s;end her &s;uch another order, as he had &s;ent to her Si&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Mademoi&s;elle Chambonneau</HI> was in a great con&s;ter|nation, when &s;he heard of <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Soi&s;&s;on's</HI> fate; &s;he was affraid, that &s;ince the King had dealt &s;o hardly by a Per&s;on of her Birth, he might come to deal more &s;everely by her, how &s;mall provocation &s;oever, &s;he &s;hould give him; &s;he therefore intreated many of the young <HI>Beaus</HI> that frequented her hou&s;e, that they &s;hould come but &s;eldom thither. But he who had &s;ucceeded to Prince <HI>Philip</HI> having encouraged her, by an Oath that he made to her, that he would pre&s;erve her, from all hazards; &s;he &s;oon recall'd tho&s;e whom &s;o lately &s;he had advi&s;ed to &s;eek for diver&s;ions el&s;e|where. But there were two of them, whom &s;he endeavoured all &s;he could, to di&s;courage from coming to her Hou&s;e; becau&s;e &s;he thought neither of 'em fit for her purpo&s;e; the one was the <HI>Baillif D'Auvergne,</HI> elde&s;t Son of the Count <HI>D'Au|vergne;</HI> who had already &s;o much offended his Fa|ther, that he had nothing to expect from him. For he had forced him to ingage him&s;elf in the order of <HI>Malta,</HI> and to give up his right of primogeni|ture in Favours of that Brother, who was next to him in age. The other was the <HI>Chevalier de Kailus,</HI> a younger brother of the Marquis <HI>de Kailus,</HI> who has married <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Vilette,</HI> a Cou&s;in of <HI>Madam de Mantenons.</HI> This Man had not the &s;ame faults that the <HI>Baillif de Auvergne</HI> had; yet he had as &s;mall a &s;hare in <HI>Mademoi&s;elle Chambonneau</HI>'s Fa|vors as the other had, though I know not upon
<PB N="49" REF="50">
what account it was &s;o. And &s;he endeavoured to &s;et them at variance, that by the one, &s;he might come to get rid of the other; or rather, that &s;he might get rid of them both at the &s;ame time. The be&s;t means &s;he could think on for this, was, under pretence of Friend&s;hip, to make every one of them believe, that the other &s;pake much to his di&s;advantage; they ea&s;ily believ'd what &s;he &s;aid, for each of them was per&s;waded, that &s;he loved him dearly; and therefore, thought it im|po&s;&s;ible, that &s;he could tell him any thing, that was fal&s;e. They began then to look a &s;quint up|on one another, but their Re&s;entments were too &s;trong to &s;top there. They agreed to do one ano|ther Ju&s;tice, with Sword in hand; and to try, which of them <HI>Madm. de Chambonneau</HI> &s;hould be|long to. They agreed to meet, in the Court of the Abbey of St. <HI>Germain,</HI> and that the one of them &s;hould make, as if he were going into the Church, while the other was coming out of it, that &s;o, it might &s;eem, that they had met only by chance; for they knew, how &s;evere the King was to tho&s;e, that dar'd to tran&s;gre&s;s his Edicts; and e&s;pecially that, which he had made again&s;t Duels: they knew, that he could never be prevail'd with, to grant a Pardon to any Man who had been &s;o un|fortunate, as to fall into that Crime.</P>
<P>They met, as they had appointed, and drew their Swords, but were parted before much blood was &s;hed. Yet the one of them wounded the o|ther, and each of them retir'd to a Friends hou&s;e; and re&s;olved not to come abroad, till they &s;hould know fir&s;t, if it was &s;afe for them to appear; but they had notice very &s;oon, that they &s;hould do well to lurk; and that the King was no &s;ooner informed of their fighting, but that he had &s;ent an Order to the Procuror General of the Parliament, to en|quire after that Matter. The Count <HI>d' Auvergn</HI> went at the &s;ame time to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and &s;aid to
<PB N="50" REF="51">
the King, that though he came to beg a favour of him, yet it was not at all for his Son, who had now of a long time behav'd him&s;elf &s;o unworthi|ly, that he did not concern him&s;elf in any thing upon his Account.</P>
<P>But &s;eeing, as the ca&s;e &s;tood, if he was &s;enten|ced to die, the like Sentence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s again&s;t the <HI>Chevalier de Kailus,</HI> who de&s;erv'd much better than his Son did, that his Condition and Circum&s;tances &s;hould be regarded; he did therefore, upon his Account, rather than upon his own, &s;upplicate His Maje&s;ty to give Orders, that the whole Affair might be well examined; for if there was any credit to be given to tho&s;e who waited on his Son, he had fought only upon an acciden|tal Rencounter, and without any premeditated de|&s;ign to tran&s;gre&s;s His Maje&s;ty's Laws. It would have been a very extraordinary thing for a Fa|ther, (who what Faults &s;oever his Son hath com|mitted, ea&s;ily forgets them, when his Life is at Stake,) thus to have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, in good earne&s;t; but it was fit, the Count &s;hould u&s;e &s;ome Art upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion. He knew, that &s;ome|times Prudence will oblige a Man to blame tho&s;e, who he de&s;igns &s;hould be found innocent; e&s;pe|cially, when he is &s;peaking to tho&s;e whom they are accountable to, for what they have done; and who are offended with them. For as one &s;eldom gains any thing, by oppo&s;ing a pa&s;&s;ionate Man, while his Anger is at its height; but upon the other hand brings him &s;oone&s;t to Rea&s;on, by &s;eem|ing to go along with him in his Sentiments; &s;o it is with regard to a Prince, who alledges, that &s;uch a man has tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed his Laws; and there|fore de&s;erves to be puni&s;hed. However, the King having given him as favourable a Reception, as he could have de&s;ired; an&s;wered him, that both for his Sons &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of the Chevalier <HI>de Kailus,</HI> he wi&s;hed that it might be found &s;o,
<PB N="51" REF="52">
as he had heard; but that he would be very &s;oon informed of it, for he had already given &s;uch &s;trict Orders about it, that it was altogether need|le&s;s to give any more.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the King came to be infor|med, that it was upon <HI>Madam Chambonneau's</HI> Account, that they had come to fight; and that &s;he had indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;et them together by the Ears, by her fal&s;e Reports: Upon which he &s;ent a Letter <HI>de cachet,</HI> ordering her to be bani&s;h d to <HI>Rowan.</HI> There were &s;ome young Coun&s;ellors of that Parliament, who got into a humour of courting her, but &s;he found a great difference between them, and that great croud of Per&s;ons of Quality, who u&s;ed to frequent her Hou&s;e at <HI>Paris.</HI> And being &s;oon wearied of that Town, &s;he would have lan|gui&s;hed to death, but that &s;he hoped, that her Friends would employ all their Intere&s;ts to have her recalled. But as among the va&s;t number of Women, who live as &s;he did, there are but few, who are &s;o fortunate as was <HI>Ninon Lendos;</HI> that is, there are but few of them, who have the art to engage People to love them, notwith&s;tanding all the Lewdne&s;s they can be guilty of; &s;o tho&s;e who had &s;een her at <HI>Paris,</HI> forgot her much &s;oo|ner than &s;he thought of. And at la&s;t having lo&s;t all her hopes, &s;he was &s;o overwhelmed with grief, that &s;he died &s;oon after.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Nevers,</HI> who while &s;he was at <HI>Rowan,</HI> knew his Son's Character better, than to be affraid that he would be at the pains to go thither, (for the Count <HI>de Donzi</HI> is a Man who can very &s;oon forget both Friends and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es) the Duke <HI>de Nevers</HI> I &s;ay, who had nothing to fear on that &s;core, got an Order to &s;et him at liberty: But it was upon condition, that he &s;hould go to <HI>Mou|lins,</HI> and wait there, till the Duke <HI>de Vendome</HI> his Cou&s;in, with whom he had made the la&s;t Cam|paign, and with whom he re&s;olved that he &s;hould
<PB N="52" REF="53">
make the next, &s;hould be in a readine&s;s to &s;et for|ward for the Camp. In the mean while, <HI>Ma|damoi&s;elle de Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> left <HI>Paris,</HI> in obedience to the King&punc;s Commands, and went to her Mother a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI></P>
<P>This Lady, who while her Husband was alive had been an Honour to <HI>France;</HI> as far, as a co&s;tly and magnificent way of living can be accounted &s;o; had fallen on a &s;udden, (if I may &s;o &s;ay, from Greatne&s;s and Splendor, into Poverty and Mi&s;ery: having been accu&s;ed of poy&s;oning her Hu&s;+band; for which &s;he was forced to make her E&s;+cape into <HI>Flanders,</HI> without having &s;o much as 24 Hours allowed her, to put her Affairs in order If we may give credit to what &s;he &s;ays her&s;elf &s;he was altogether innocent of this Crime: And it was her mortal Enemy, the Marquis <HI>de Louvois,</HI> who had forged that Accu&s;ation again&s;t her, becau&s;e &s;he would never be in Friend&s;hip with him. But whatever may be in this, 'tis certain, that at Court, &s;he has always been reputed guilty of that Crime. Whether it be, that &s;he has &s;till powerful Ene|mies there, or that the King is convinced, that &s;he is not unju&s;tly accu&s;ed, I cannot tell; but there is not one, that offers to e&s;pou&s;e her Intere&s;ts. Before that <HI>Madamoi&s;elle de Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> went to that Country, it was reported, that &s;he would go to <HI>Avignon,</HI> and that <HI>Madam de Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> her Mother, would go and live there al&s;o: becau&s;e &s;he could not live any longer at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> where every thing was &s;o dear. A certain Woman named <HI>Vendome,</HI> who is well known at Court, not by her Quality, but becau&s;e &s;he brings thither Sallads for the King and Nobility, which are better than any that comes from another hand; hearing, that this Prince&s;s was brought &s;o very low, and remembring her former Splendour that &s;he had often &s;een; was &s;o touched with Compa&s;&s;ion for her, that &s;he &s;ent her as much Money, as one of her &s;mall Stock
<PB N="53" REF="54">
was able to &s;pare, and 'tis &s;aid, that &s;he received it; yea, and that &s;he was very well plea&s;ed with it. But this is what I cannot aver for a truth, tho' I have heard it told to &s;ome Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Quality, who may have known &s;omething of it them&s;elves. But I can &s;carcely believe, that this Prince&s;s, was ever reduc'd to &s;o great Straits, as to accept of &s;o &s;mall a Summ as that was; and at lea&s;t, I wi&s;h it may not have been &s;o, after having my &s;elf been Witne&s;s of the great Pomp &s;he former|ly liv'd in. Yet it was commonly reported at Court, that had not the Lady of a Foreign Prince's Mini|&s;ter, &s;upplyed her with Money, &s;he had not known how to &s;atisfie her Baker and Butcher, who dun'd her continually for the Money &s;he ow'd them.</P>
<P>Whatever was in this, her Family has been in a declining State the&s;e Twenty Five Years pa&s;t, and is very much lower, than it was before that time; and this Prince&s;s's Son, who &s;hould have rai&s;ed it up again, having been &s;o low-&s;pirited, as to Marry a Girl, who is unworthy of his Birth, has been obliged to go out of the Kingdom, becau&s;e he found that he could not live in it with honour. And if it be true, that this Prin|ces Mother, was guilty of what was laid to her charge, we may pre&s;ume, that all that has befallen her, is the effect of Divine ju&s;tice, which doth not &s;uffer that Crimes of this nature &s;hould continue unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>Madamoi&s;elle de Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> was not the only Per&s;on who&s;e Conduct the King endeavoured to reform; he took much the &s;ame mea&s;ures with <HI>Madam de la Force,</HI> who is one of the two Daughters which the late Marquis <HI>de Ca&s;telmoron</HI> had left be|hind him; the other was married to the Marquis <HI>de Bricquemau,</HI> a Name well know among the French Prote&s;tants, as well as that of <HI>de la Force.</HI> But that Religion being now prohibited, the Marquis <HI>de Bricquemau,</HI> thought fit to obey the King,
<PB N="54" REF="55">
who Commanded all his Subjects to be Roman Ca|tholicks.</P>
<P><HI>Madamoi&s;elle de la Force,</HI> had already had many Intrigues, which had made much noi&s;e; and a|mong others, tho&s;e with the Marquis <HI>de Ne&s;le,</HI> and with the Pre&s;ident <HI>de Brion's</HI> Son. This la&s;t had di&s;graced her yet more than the other; be|cau&s;e this Pre&s;ident's Son, was but of a very mean extract in compari&s;on of her. For without having recour&s;e to the idle fancies of the Family of <HI>la Force,</HI> which pretends to be de&s;cended of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> about which the Genea|logi&s;ts are not agreed; or to what is pretended, that the name of <HI>Nompart</HI> which they bear, with that of <HI>Caumont,</HI> was given them, becau&s;e one of their Ance&s;tors killed a Dragon, which de|&s;troyed all that Country, where their chief Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions and Intere&s;ts in Land do now lie: I &s;ay, that without laying any &s;tre&s;s on the&s;e things, it is certain that the Family of <HI>la Force,</HI> is a very Illu&s;trious and a very Antient Family. It has produced two Mare&s;chals of <HI>France,</HI> the one ju&s;t after the other; of the fir&s;t of which, the Father <HI>Mainbourg</HI> has given us a Hi&s;tory, which he has compo&s;ed after his own fancy, in his Book of <HI>Calvini&s;m;</HI> but he is &s;o often mi&s;taken in every thing, that he has Written, that a Man mu&s;t be at pains to compo&s;e as many Volumes as he has done, if he would take in hand to di&s;cover all his Mi&s;takes. But &s;ince we have occa&s;ion here, to &s;peak of this Mare&s;chal, who was called <HI>James,</HI> I &s;hall give a true and genuine account of what befel him, at the Ma&s;&s;acre of St. <HI>Bartho|lomew,</HI> quite different from what is given by that Je&s;uit.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> IX. having formed a de&s;ign, to catch all the Prote&s;tants of <HI>France</HI> in one Net, and at the &s;ame time; made as many of them as he could, e&s;pe|cially of the leading Men among them, come to
<PB N="55" REF="56">
Court, that he might cau&s;e them to be murdered (&s;o to &s;peak) in his own &s;ight; while by his Or|ders, the &s;ame was to be done, upon the &s;ame day and at the &s;ame hour, in all the parts of the Kingdom: It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s, to tell here how it was po&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch a De&s;ign could be executed, without being di&s;covered before hand to tho&s;e again&s;t whom it was formed; be&s;ides, that though I &s;hould make all the plau&s;ible Con|jectures imaginable, I could not expect to &s;ucceed better, than they have done, who have beat their Brains to tell us their Conjectures about it; and at la&s;t I &s;hould be forced to confe&s;s, as they do, that it was a thing that God had re&s;olved from all Eterni|ty, and that he put a vail before the Eyes of all tho&s;e who were appointed to &s;uffer, that they might not know the imminent dangers that threatned them. However this be, <HI>James</HI>'s Father being come to <HI>Pa|ris,</HI> where he was called by the King, and having brought along with him his two Sons, <HI>viz. James</HI> and his elder Brother; he and they were among the fir&s;t who were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated. <HI>James</HI> was but Fourteen Years old, but was of a much readier wit, than is u&s;ual for Boys of that age, and he &s;eigned him&s;elf dead, upon his receiving the fir&s;t blow; that was the rea&s;on why he was left there, and had no more wounds given him; and lying &s;tretched out at full length between his Father and his Brother, who were killed dead, he had al&s;o &s;o much pre&s;ence of mindas to take off a Diamond of great value, which his Father had upon his Finger, and to put it in his Mouth, with an other which he had him&s;elf; for he did not doubt, but the People would &s;oon come and &s;trip them, and take every thing that was about them; and he was affraid, that if he &s;hould keep nothing for getting his Wound cured, and for main|taining him&s;elf in &s;ome private place, till the &s;torm were over, he might come to be &s;tarved to death. It happened ju&s;t &s;o as he had gue&s;&s;ed would:
<PB N="56" REF="57">
all the People about the <HI>Louvre,</HI> where his Fa|ther was lodged, hearing what had been done, came immediately to make all the advantages they could of the Cloaths of the&s;e murdered Prote&s;tants. The Ma&s;ter of a Tennis Court, that was in that part of the Town, who knew Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Force's</HI> Sons, becau&s;e they had play'd &s;ometimes at the Tennis, which he kept, happened by good luck to come to their Hou&s;e, when he was going a pillaging as well as others: He was &s;o touched with compa&s;&s;ion, when he &s;aw them in that condition, that he cry'd out and &s;poke of it aloud, though he was all alone.</P>
<P><HI>James,</HI> who knew him, thought that he might tru&s;t him&s;elf with him, and tell him, that he was not as yet dead. The Ma&s;ter of the Tennis, being overjoyed to &s;ee him yet alive, bid him get up and go along with him; and promi&s;ed to keep him in his Hou&s;e, and that he &s;hould not at all di&s;cover him, but that he &s;hould be in as great &s;afety with him as ever he had been in his own Father's hou&s;e; but becau&s;e he had no Cloak to give him, and that he could not go out, naked as he was, for another had already &s;tript him of his Cloaths; <HI>James</HI> therefore, de&s;ir'd him to go and &s;eek for one to him, and to bring a Lanthorn with him, that he might have the grea|ter Benefit of his kind Offers. The Ma&s;ter of the Tennis, brought him all that he had de&s;ired, and a Hat al&s;o; and making him go before him, as if he had been his Boy; he brought him to his hou&s;e, where his Wife asked him, who he was; he told her, that &s;he was not concerned to know that, and that &s;he had nothing to do, but to u&s;e him kindly. She judged by this, that he was &s;ome Hu|guenot of Note; which &s;he was yet more per&s;wa|ded of, when upon his Finger, &s;he &s;aw the Dia|monds which he had &s;av'd, and &s;he coveted very much to have them; but not knowing any other way, how to come by them, &s;he began to &s;ay to her Husband, that &s;he was very de&s;irous he &s;hould

Her Hus|band, who had been forced to tell her who he was, that the hopes &s;he might have, of being well re|warded one day, might give her &s;atisfaction; en|deavoured to &s;atisfie her with the &s;ame hopes. But &s;he had rather have what was pre&s;ent, than what was but to come, and &s;he continued to pre&s;s him that he would rid him&s;elf of this Stranger; telling him, that it &s;eem'd he knew not well what he was doing, when he put him&s;elf into &s;o great hazard, without any pro&s;pect of ad|vantage. The Tennis-court keeper, finding, that he could not &s;atisfie her with Rea&s;on, adverti&s;ed <HI>James</HI> of it, that he might choo&s;e rather to go el&s;e|where, than to expo&s;e him&s;elf to new Dangers. <HI>La Force</HI> an&s;wered him, that he would &s;oon find a Remedy for that: He knew that this Woman coveted his Diamonds, becau&s;e &s;he had many times &s;poken to him of them; he therefore gave her one of them, which procured him peace and quiet for &s;ome days. But becau&s;e, that which he had kept to him&s;elf, was the fine&s;t of the two, and that he had given her only the lea&s;t, her wicked hu|mour returned very &s;oon, in&s;omuch that &s;he di|&s;turbed her Husband with her Importunities, as much as before. He who was a man of much ho|ne&s;ty, could not approve of her Behaviour, and reproved her &s;harply for it. But finding that &s;he per&s;evered in her Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and that &s;he va|lued her Intere&s;t, more than any other thing, he &s;poke to <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Force,</HI> that he might have a care, not to make a Pre&s;ent to her of the other Diamond, and he told him, that it would be much better for him, that he &s;hould go to one of his Friends hou&s;es, and that if he knew any of them

He afterwards married <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Biron</HI>'s Daughter, in gratitude to him, for having &s;hel|ter'd him, when he was in hazard of his Life; and at la&s;t he was advanced to the Dignity of Duke, and Peer, and Mar&s;hal of <HI>France.</HI> He died when he was Eighty years of Age, Loaded with Riches and Honour.

<HI>Madamoi&s;elle de la Force,</HI> of whom we are now di&s;cour&s;ing, was de&s;cended al&s;o of the &s;ame <HI>James,</HI> who was her Grandfather; but her way of living being altogether unworthy of the Grandchild of &s;o great a Man, who had lived always like a Man of true Honour and Vertue; the King cau|&s;ed a Complement to be made her, much like to that, which had been made to <HI>Madamoi&s;elle de Soi&s;&s;ons;</HI> he ordered that it &s;hould be told her, that there were but two things, of which &s;he might choo&s;e one, that was, either to go out of the King|dom, or to go in to a Convent: &s;uch an Order as this, was like a Thunderbolt to this young La|dy. But as there is no di&s;puting with the King, &s;he cho&s;e the Convent; upon condition always, that His Maje&s;ty &s;hould give her, wherewith to pay her Board. For though &s;he had many In|trigues in her time, yet &s;he was &s;o much a Beggar, that &s;he had not wherewith to maintain her&s;elf: Perhaps, had &s;he been richer, &s;he would not have gone and buried her&s;elf alive, within the Walls of a Cloy&s;ter; but as Nece&s;&s;ity forces many People to do many things, which otherwi&s;e they would not incline to; it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to take any other cour&s;e, than what &s;he did. There was one <HI>Madam Thaumur,</HI> who underwent the &s;ame Fate, though &s;he was married, and her Hu&s;|band Captain of the Gallies of <HI>Ver&s;ailles;</HI> yet he was &s;o good natured, as never to complain of her Conduct. But the King, who had declared open|ly before all the Court, that he would not &s;uffer any Per&s;on, to give ill Example to another, knowing that him&s;elf was charitable enough, to comfort an old <HI>Sui&s;&s;e</HI> for the lo&s;s of his Wife, cau&s;ed her to be &s;hut up among the penitent Maids.</P>
<P>This frighted a great many Women, who&s;e Conduct was nothing better than hers; while all good People approved of his Maje&s;ty's Re|&s;olution, for the Reformation of Manners.</P>

He commanded the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> that in his Station, he &s;hould vigorou&s;ly pur&s;ue the &s;ame de&s;ign as well as he did. That Prelate gave Or|ders to the Clergy of that great City, that every one of them &s;hould enquire diligently, within the bounds of his Pari&s;h, after tho&s;e who lived licen|tiou&s;ly, whether under the pretence of their Great|ne&s;s, or under pretence of Clande&s;tine Marriage. His Maje&s;ty's Care extended al&s;o, farther than this Capital City; for he &s;ent the &s;ame Orders to all the Bi&s;hops of the Kingdom. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Angers</HI> had a Man in his Dioce&s;s, who was ra|ther rich than of Quality, and who was in one of the&s;e two Ca&s;es. It was the Count <HI>de Serran,</HI> who had been Chancellor of <HI>Monteur:</HI> he lived familiarly with one <HI>Madam Racapee;</HI> but it was not known how they came to live together, whe|ther they lived in Whoredom, or if there had been a Clande&s;tine Marriage between them; for the&s;e &s;orts of Marriages are much in fa&s;hion at this time, in&s;omuch, that we &s;eldom hear of any other. The Bi&s;hop went and paid him a vi&s;it, as he us'd frequently to do; but after he had dined with him, and with this Lady, who ordered all the Affairs of his hou&s;e; he told him, that he would not de|lay any longer to acquaint him, with the Rea&s;ons that had obliged him to pay him that vi&s;it. That His Maje&s;ty had commanded him to enquire of him, what was the Relation he was in to that Lady, who had the tru&s;t of every thing in his hou&s;e. For if &s;he &s;erved him only for his plea&s;ure, and was not married to him, he mu&s;t re&s;olve never to &s;ee her any more. The Count <HI>de Serran</HI> knowing that his Wealth, which made him ab&s;olute in that Coun|try, could do him no &s;ervice, in &s;hifting a que|&s;tion that was put to him in the Kings Name; was forced to own, that they were mar|ried together. The Bi&s;hop an&s;wered him, that his owning of the Marriage was &s;omething, and
<PB N="61" REF="62">
that he could di&s;cour&s;e willingly with him upon the rea&s;ons, which he offered him at the &s;ame time, for hav|ing &s;o long concealed it; but that all that was not e|nough, for &s;uch an An&s;wer, as he mu&s;t give the King. That if it were only he, who as Bi&s;hop of the place, came to enquire after it; he would be|lieve it, upon his word; but &s;ince his bu&s;ine&s;s was with the King, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew other Proofs for it. The Count hearing him &s;peak after &s;uch a manner, went and &s;earched for the Marriage-contract, which he had made with this Lady, and &s;hewed him at the &s;ame time, a Certificate of their Marriage. He asked for no more, and having given an Account of it to the King, it has produ|ced &s;o good an effect, that this Count owns it o|penly in his Family; &s;o that Madam <HI>de Racapee,</HI> is now con&s;idered as his Lady.</P>
<P>About this time, the City of <HI>Paris</HI> came to have one of its principal Magi&s;trates changed, though this Office be neither ancient nor honourable; I mean the Office of <HI>Lieutenant de Police,</HI> which was at its fir&s;t In&s;titution, in the year 1667. be&s;towed upon <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Reinie,</HI> who is &s;till alive. For there was never any &s;uch Magi&s;trate before that time, and all the parts of that Office were performed by the <HI>Lieutenant Civil.</HI> But His Maje&s;ty con&s;idering, that in &s;o great a City as this Metropolis, it was too great a Charge for one Man, to attend particular Affairs, and the more publick Concerns of the City at the &s;ame time; he created this new Office in his Favour. 'Tis true, Political Rea&s;ons obliged him to in&s;titute it, as much as Zeal for Ju&s;tice did. For the King had found by experience, while he was under age, that this City alone, was capable by its example, to cau&s;e an In&s;urrection throughout the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e Kingdom. And therefore, he thought fit, to have a Man there, of his own Appointment, in whom he might put con|fidence, who might narrowly ob&s;erve every thing that was done in the City. He &s;ettled Twelve Thou|&s;and
<PB N="62" REF="63">
Franks a year upon this Magi&s;trate; and <HI>Mon|&s;ieur de la Reinie,</HI> after he had di&s;charged this Office, for at lea&s;t 25 years, becoming old, and perhaps that he might complement the chief Mini&s;ter of State, de&s;ired him &s;ome years ago, that he would give him his Nephew <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Bignon</HI> for his Coadjutor.</P>
<P>As this Office, gives a Man much Authority and Intere&s;t at Court, upon which he immediately de|pends; therefore, <HI>Mon&s;ieur Bignon,</HI> who is now In|tendant of <HI>Picardy,</HI> accepted of it, by the Advice of his Parents and Friends; but being of a Family, that has been always obliging and full of huma|nity, he became &s;oon wearied of it; for he &s;aw, that he could not di&s;charge that Office, unle&s;s, he be|came &s;evere and rigorous, and therefore, he made an Intere&s;t, to be Intendant of a Province, and ob|tained that of <HI>Amie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</HI> In the mean while, <HI>Mon|&s;ieur de Reinie</HI> growing now very old, for he is about Eighty years of Age, &s;upplicated anew, that he might be ea&s;ed of this Burden, and that he might be allowed to &s;ell his Office. The King granted his reque&s;t, upon condition, that he &s;hould re&s;ign in favour of <HI>Mon&s;ieur d' Argen&s;on.</HI> This Gentleman is of much better Quality than <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Reinie,</HI> and falls nothing &s;hort of him, as to good &s;en&s;e; be|&s;ides, that he has all nece&s;&s;ary Qualities to make him&s;elf to be feared, and his very Pre&s;ence &s;trikes dread, if it doth not create re&s;pect. His Father had been the Kings Emba&s;&s;ador to the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> and his Ance&s;tors were equally famous for the Gown and for the Sword; but 'tis &s;eldom that a Man grows rich by Emba&s;&s;ies, and his Father who is &s;till alive, &s;pent a good part of his own E&s;tate in that Em|ployment; &s;o that his Son had been forced to ac|cept of an Office, that was below him, that is, to be Lieutenant General of <HI>Limoges;</HI> but his good Fortune having brought him to Court, and having got &s;ome Commi&s;&s;ions, of which he &s;o acquitted him|&s;elf,
<PB N="63" REF="64">
that the Court was fully &s;atisfied with what he had done, he thereby opened the way to this Employment we are now &s;peaking of: The Lieu|tenant <HI>de Police</HI> is an&s;werable to the Parliament of <HI>Paris;</HI> and therefore <HI>Mon&s;ieur D' Argen&s;on,</HI> &s;ome days, after he had entered upon his Office, went and pay'd a vi&s;it to the chief Pre&s;ident, and begged the honour of his Protection. This Magi&s;trate, who has a grave A&s;pect and affects to appear graver than he truly is, received him the &s;ame way, that he u&s;es to receive all other People, and heard his Complement without &s;o much as moving an Eyebrow: finding that he had done with it, made him no an&s;wer but the&s;e Three Words, <HI>Safety, Cleanne&s;s, Light;</HI> and im|mediately turned his back upon him. <HI>Mon&s;ieur D' Argen&s;on</HI> would have been more &s;urpri&s;ed, if he had not known his Character; but having known it of a long time, he returned home, thinking what could be the meaning of the&s;e Three Words, and he &s;oon found it out. He under&s;tood ea&s;ily that by the fir&s;t, he meant, that he &s;hould take care of the night Watch, that no Robberies or Murders by Night might be heard of in the City. By the Second, that he &s;hould take care, that tho&s;e who had the charge of clean|&s;ing the Streets, &s;hould punctually do their duty; and by the Third, that he &s;hould do the &s;ame, as to tho&s;e, who have the charge of the Lan|thorns: The&s;e Three parts of this Office, made <HI>Mon&s;ieur Bignon</HI> nau&s;eate it; and there were al&s;o &s;ome other things in it, that were no le&s;s di&s;a|greable to &s;uch a Man as he is.</P>
<P>However, his nicene&s;s, was much to <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la Reinie's</HI> advantage, for he got Fifty Thou|&s;and Crowns from <HI>Mon&s;ieur D' Argen&s;on,</HI> for re|&s;igning his place to him; and he would have got much more, had not the King determined the Price. The Lieutenant <HI>de Police</HI> pays no yearly
<PB N="64" REF="65">
Tax to the King for his Office, as all the Offices of Long Robe do, except the Chancellor, the Chief Pre&s;i|dent of Parliament; and . . . . . And the King gave <HI>Mon&s;ieur D'Argen&s;on,</HI> a Warrant of Reten&s;ion for a Hundred Thou&s;and <HI>Franks;</HI> He enter'd upon the Exerci&s;e of it, by declaring War again&s;t all tho&s;e, whether Men or Women, that u&s;ed to play at Lan&s;quenet; He had expre&s;s Orders for this, from his Maje&s;ty; becau&s;e he had ob&s;erved, that in &s;ome Years before, that unhappy Game, as well as the other Game of Ba&s;&s;et; had ruin'd a great number of the Officers of his Army, who had been forced to quit their Companies, be|cau&s;e, they had lo&s;t all the Money, with which, they &s;hould have rai&s;ed Recruits.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur Bignon</HI> Coun&s;ellor of State, who was the Father of that Gentleman I was ju&s;t now &s;peaking of; came to die &s;uddenly, about this time, without having any time to prepare him&s;elf for another World: He had gone to bed at Night, af|ter having taken his Supper as he u&s;ed to do, without complaining of any Pain or Sickne&s;s; but the next Morning, he was found dead in his Bed. The Office of State which he had enjoyed, would have been very convenient for his Son, who had nothing el&s;e to hope for, by his Death; for all his E&s;tate was not &s;ufficient to pay his Debts; But becau&s;e the King had declared long ago, that he would not at all, make tho&s;e Offices like He|re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">itary ones, to de&s;cend from Father to Son, he therefore, thought it his intere&s;t to proceed cautiou&s;ly in this matter, and to take prudent mea&s;ures, before he &s;hould addre&s;s him&s;elf to the King for it. It was ea&s;ier for him, than it would have been for another Man, to bring about this de&s;ign; becau&s;e he was the Nephew of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Ponchartrain,</HI> who had &s;erved the King to very good purpo&s;e, ever &s;ince the time that he was made Comptrollor-General, in the place o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">

<HI>Mon&s;ieur le Pelletier.</HI> There were few, who could have acquitted them&s;elves in &s;o difficult a po&s;t, with &s;o much Art and Succe&s;s, as he has done, at a time, when the publick Affairs were in &s;uch a po&s;ture, as they have always been in &s;ince he was called to it. Tis certainly matter of Wonder and of Amazement at the &s;ame time, to &s;ee the dif|ference betwixt the way of managing the King's Revenues at this time, and that which was taken under the Mini&s;try of Cardinal <HI>Mazarin.</HI> For when there was need but of a Million, they were at incredible pains and toil, to contrive a way how to rai&s;e it: Tho&s;e who are acquainted with the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times, know, that when <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was taken in the year 1658. it could not be ran|&s;omed out of the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> becau&s;e we had not Three Millions of Money to give for it; for which Sum we could have recovered it, by vir|tue of a &s;ecret Treaty with <HI>Cromwell;</HI> &s;o that the King was forced to add a Million more to that Sum, when he redeemed it &s;ome Years after: Be&s;ides, it was needful then, to u&s;e all the Political Arts and Pretences imaginable, before that &s;uch a Sum could be rai&s;ed Whereas now, if the King had u&s;e for Fifty Millions, he has nothing to do but to &s;peak the word, and he has it, &s;o to &s;peak, in a Quarter of an Hour. However, <HI>Mon&s;ieur Pontchartrain</HI> did not rely &s;o much upon his own Merits, as upon that account to flatter him&s;elf with the hopes of obtaining this fa|vour to his Nephew, becau&s;e of &s;ome difficulties which he fore&s;aw mu&s;t be removed, before he could &s;peak of it to his Maje&s;ty: The great difficulty was, that the King had promi&s;ed to <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Caumartin,</HI> Intendant of the Kings Revenues, the fir&s;t place that &s;hould fall void, among the Coun&s;ellors of State: He knew that the King was mindful of his Promi&s;es, and that he would not forget them, but for very good Rea&s;ons; and therefore, he &s;pake to <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Cau|martin,</HI> and told him, he would oblige him very much,

if he would quit his Preten&s;ions in Favour of his Ne|phew.

The fir&s;t time that he &s;at in Council, he pretended to take his Place, as if he had been always there, from the fir&s;t Day he was named Intendant of the Reve|nues, becau&s;e the&s;e Intendants have a Brief of the Crown. as Coun&s;ellors of State; but tho&s;e whom he would have taken place of, if he had &s;ucceeded in his Claim, oppo&s;ing him in that matter, the Chan|cellor, who was proper Judge in it, determined it in their Favour.

<P>But becau&s;e his Brother had come to &s;ee him in the beginning of his Sickne&s;s, but could not come af|terwards, (for he was in his Grave) he asked the only Daughter he had, if he had already forgotten him.

<P>There were Two other Brothers, died &s;ome days after the death of the Two <HI>Bignons,</HI> and there was one &s;trange thing ob&s;erved of them; that never any thing happened to the one, but what befel the other at the &s;ame time: they were Twins, and &s;o like one another in the Face, that had not the one been a Soldier, and the other a Lawyer, &s;o that their different Garbs made them known, the one would have been often taken for the other. They were both much given to gaming, and if one lo&s;t his mo|ney, it was &s;ure the other lo&s;t his al&s;o, at the &s;ame time. When he who went to the Army was wound|ed, the other was wounded al&s;o by a fall, or &s;ome other Accident. If the one had a Mi&s;tre&s;s that jilted him, the other met with the &s;ame Treat|ment from his. In a word, all the difference that ever was taken notice of, was, that the one con|tinued a Batchelor, much longer than the other; and there was nothing wanting in their whole life, but that one thing, to ju&s;tifie what is ordinarily &s;aid of Children, that are born at the &s;ame Birth; That whatever happens to the one, inevitably be|fals the other.

And though they had run headlong into the Confederacy again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, when it was propos'd to them; yet, that was only, becau&s;e of the Fears they were under, from the Greatne&s;s of his Power.

But this was nothing but what <HI>Mon&s;ieur Callieres</HI> expected.

for reconciling the Orders he had from the King his Ma&s;ter, with this difficulty which the <HI>Dutch</HI> made, not to treat without the Con|&s;ent of their Allies. It was, that they &s;hould not come to a final Conclu&s;ion in any thing, without their Approbation; but if they found rea&s;on to agree to any thing, they might communicate it to them; and that convenient mea&s;ures might be taken afterwards. There was no Inconveniency in following this Advice, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> were &s;a|tisfied with it, and by Con&s;ent of their Allies too. They demanded, as Preliminaries of this Treaty, the Re&s;titution of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and of the Towns of <HI>Strasburg</HI> and <HI>Luxenbourg. Callieres</HI> con&s;ented in the Kings Name, both to the one and the other; but upon Condition, that <HI>Lorrain</HI> &s;hould be re&s;to|red to the Duke of that Name; upon &s;uch Terms, as had been agreed to, at the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen:</HI> The Pre&s;ident Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n, who took care of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain's</HI> Intere&s;ts in <HI>Holland,</HI> oppo&s;ed this; under Pretence, that when his Ma&s;ter engaged in the Confederacy, it was promi&s;ed, that Peace &s;hould never be made, till he had full Satisfaction. He repre&s;ented to the Confederates, that if his Dominions were not re&s;tored to him, but upon the Terms of the Treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> he &s;hould be &s;o far from reaping any advantage by the Con|federacy, that he &s;hould be a lo&s;er by it; &s;ince he could have made a much better market, had he taken other methods, by which he might have been put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Dominions before the War; but having thought him&s;elf oblig'd to follow his Fathers example, who would not hear of the&s;e Conditions, near Twenty Years ago; it was very hard for him, now, after &s;o many Years, to find, that no better Conditions were offered him.</P>

&s;ucce&s;sful in their de&s;igns; take not much care of their concerns, when they have no more u&s;e for them: &s;o the Allies, after having &s;poke once or twice of this Affair, thought it not worth their while to in&s;i&s;t any longer upon it: Mr. <HI>Pre&s;ident Canon,</HI> gave in &s;everal Memoirs concerning it, and they told him, that they would take time to con&s;ider them, before any thing were concluded. And though the Empe|rours Mini&s;ters joyned with him, for obtaining full &s;atisfaction to this Duke; yet neither the one nor the other were able to effectuate any thing. Things being thus far advanced, upon the part of the Dutch; and the Engli&s;h having as &s;trong Inclinations for a Peace as they had, becau&s;e of the many Prizes that were taken from them at Sea, which had brought their Trade very low; It was agreed upon all Hands, that Plenipotentiaries &s;hould be named, for bringing that to perfection, which as yet was only begun; but they had &s;ome difficulty to agree upon the Place of the Congre&s;s. The Emperour would have had it, in &s;ome Town of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the King would not hear of that propo&s;al: But his Imperial Maje&s;ty's great de&s;ire was, to Protract time, for he was not very de&s;irous of the Peace; becau&s;e &s;o long as the War &s;hould la&s;t, he knew that he was Ma&s;ter of all the Princes of the Empire, who were obliged to obey his ab&s;olute Commands; and he was afraid, that if the Peace &s;hould be con|cluded, they might come to open their Eyes, and be &s;en&s;ible of their true Intere&s;ts; and to perceive, that in being &s;o earne&s;t, for the Increa&s;e of his Power, they &s;hould them&s;elves be the Authors of his U&s;ur|pations upon their own Liberties and Prerogatives. But there was al&s;o another thing in his View, in which he con&s;ulted his own Intere&s;t, when he de|&s;ired, that the Treaty might be in &s;ome Town of the Empire; For &s;ince the Peace with <HI>Savoy,</HI> the King was &s;uperior in Forces to all the Confede|rates; having &s;ent all the Troops which had &s;erv'd

<P>But if he could not obtain, that <HI>Mentz</HI> &s;hould be the Place, yet he thought at lea&s;t, they would be &s;atisfied that <HI>Frankfort</HI> &s;hould be it. And that a Neutrality &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, for 12 or 14 Leagues round about that Town, &s;o that <HI>Mentz</HI> &s;hould be comprehended in it.

<P>Though the Emperor con&s;ented to this, as well as the re&s;t of the Confederates; yet, it was a long time before he &s;ent his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> thither; which was a Proof, that he loved maner that the War &s;hould continue, than that a Peace &s;hould be conclu|ded<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">s for the King, he made no de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ay to name <HI>Mon|&s;ieur Courtin</HI> Coun&s;ellor of rate his Plenipotentiary; a Man every way capa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">le of &s;uch an Employment, and who had acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ted him&s;elf very honourably in many Negotiations of great Importance: But he befought the King to excu&s;e him in this, becau&s;e he found his Eyes &s;o bad, that it was to be fear'd, he &s;hould lo&s;e his &s;ight altogether.

of State: He gave him <HI>Mon&s;ieur do Creci</HI> for his Colleague, and honoured al&s;o <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Cal|lieres</HI> with the &s;ame Title of Plenipotentiary. There were great things talk'd of this Man's Con|duct; though I do not &s;ee, that there was need of much Art, to do all that he did; for a man has no occa&s;ion to &s;how, how well he is qualified for Ne|gotiations of State; unle&s;s he have to &s;truggle with great difficulties, which at la&s;t he overcomes by his prudent Conduct, and brings the whole af|fair to a happy I&s;&s;ue, for the Intere&s;t of the Prince that has imployed him: But this could not be &s;aid of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Callieres,</HI> who had made the Confe|derates li&s;ten to his Propo&s;als; only by promi&s;ing in the Kings Name, that he would deliver up to them, a great number of Places, which they could not have been able to retake by force of Arms, in Twenty Years time, though they had been much &s;tronger than they were. <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Harlay,</HI> had been already employed in &s;ome &s;ecret Negotiations, but had not been &s;ucce&s;sful in them; but he and <HI>Mon&s;ieur Callieres,</HI> had a third Per&s;on joyned with them, in the great Affairs they were now to be employed in; who could direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t them, when they met with difficulties, that were too hard for them; I mean <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Creci,</HI> who is one of the be&s;t qualified Men in <HI>France,</HI> for Affairs of this nature. He and <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Harlay</HI> took their Journey together, that they might be at the place of the Congre&s;s in due time; but they were not very well &s;atisfied with one anothers Compa|ny; <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Harlay</HI> was d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;atisfied, becau&s;e <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Creci</HI>'s Reputation eclip&s;ed his own; and <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Creci,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Harlay</HI> carried it &s;o high, as if he had undervalued him.</P>
<P>The Di&s;po&s;itions they were both in made them &s;oon give &s;ome Proofs, that they were di&s;&s;atisfied with one another; for being come to <HI>L'I&s;le;</HI> there was
<PB N="80" REF="81">
one <HI>Le Normand,</HI> a Farmer-General, who took up|on him to Regale them; He was one of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Creci</HI>'s Friends, upon which account he detain'd them there, a whole day longer, than they inten|ded to have &s;taid: And that they might not blame him, for making them lo&s;e &s;o much time, he gave them Flying Coaches, to carry them Ten or Twelve Leagues farther on their Journey; but he put his Friend <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Creci</HI> into the fine&s;t Coach, with the fine&s;t Hor&s;es in it; while <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Harlay</HI> got but a &s;orry Coach, and Hor&s;es with &s;uch Col|lars as draught Hor&s;es u&s;e to have in&s;tead of Har|ne&s;s.

The Farmer-General, might have per|ceived by his looks, that he did not take it well of him, and he was heard to &s;ay behind his Back, that tho&s;e who from nothing came to po&s;&s;e&s;s good E&s;tates, could never learn to behave them&s;elves like Gentlemen. However, he made u&s;e of the Coach and Hor&s;es, &s;uch as they were, but gave not many thanks to him who had provided them.</P>
<P>The&s;e Two Plenipotentiaries had met with a number of People, betwixt <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>L'I&s;le,</HI> who wi&s;hed them a good Journey, and in the mean time be&s;ought them earne&s;tly to put an end to their Mi&s;eries, by concluding a happy Peace. They were not at all &s;urprized at this, for before they took their Journey, they knew, how much <HI>France</HI> need|ed it. And we may ea&s;ily judge, how much the Trea&s;ure of the Kingdom was exhau&s;ted, when we con&s;ider what Taxes and Sub&s;idies mu&s;t have been paid to the King, to enable him to re&s;i&s;t &s;o many Forces, as had con&s;pired again&s;t him. He had no le&s;s than 500000 Men under Pay, by Sea and by Lard; which no doubt will appear incredible to Po&s;terity: It was nece&s;&s;ary, that People of all Ranks
<PB N="81" REF="82">
and Conditions within the Kingdom, &s;hould bear their Proportionable &s;hare of this Burthen; &s;o that in impo&s;ing the Taxes, there was a nece&s;&s;ity to do every thing, &s;o to &s;peak, by Weight and Mea&s;ure, that no man might be oppre&s;&s;ed, or obliged to pay more than his Proportion. And this is what the King's Mini&s;ters have done, with &s;o much Conduct and Prudence; that though every man is &s;en&s;ible of his own Lo&s;s; yet it is nothing, in compari&s;on of what it would have been, if tho&s;e Affairs had been managed by Per&s;ons of le&s;s Skill and Art, than they are. However, the&s;e Plenipotentiaries &s;aw the &s;ame thing in <HI>Flanders,</HI> that they had &s;een in <HI>France;</HI> that is, they &s;aw, that the People there were no le&s;s weary of the War, than the <HI>French;</HI> They likewi&s;e be&s;ought them, with the greate&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s, to u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours for &s;ucceeding in the Treaty, which they were going to negotiate. At la&s;t they came to <HI>Delf,</HI> where the Hou&s;es were become &s;o dear, &s;ince the People of that Town knew, that they were to come thi|ther, that they could &s;carcely be had for Mo|ney.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were a doing, the Procura|tor-General, whom the King had ordered to en|quire into the matter of the Duel, that had been fought between the Baili&s;t <HI>d' Auvergne</HI> and the <HI>Che|valier de Kailus,</HI> gave him an Account of the Di&s;covery, he had made in it: But it was not at all to their advantage: He reported, that ac|cording to the <HI>Affidav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI>'s that were made before him it was far from having been an accidental Rencounter, as their Parents had alledged; that never Duel was more clearly proved, and therefore he de&s;ired to know, what Orders His Maje&s;ty would give about it. His Maje&s;ty ordered, that they &s;hould be Arraigned, Indited and Tried as Crimi|nals; &s;o that the &s;ame Officer, having cau&s;ed it to be publi&s;hed, through the City by &s;ound of Trum|pet;

They brought this good News to his Eminence, who knew not the cau&s;e of their meeting, and they told him at the &s;ame time, that &s;ince he was going to <HI>Rome,</HI> and that it belonged to the Pope to confirm their Election, they did not doubt, but he &s;hould obtain that favour of his Ho|line&s;s, when ever he thought fit to ask it; and they took leave of him, with this Compliment, for which his Eminence thanked them very heartily.

<P>The Cardinal <HI>de Bouillon</HI> would fain have carried along with him <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Coulanges,</HI> who is a plea&s;ant &s;ort of a man, and what he &s;ays, is ve|ry diverting; he drinks, compo&s;es, and &s;ings; and he has good Skill in Sauces and Ragoo's; and in a word, he knows how to &s;pend his time agree|ably, which makes many People de&s;ire his Com|pany: He had once &s;tay'd with his Eminence, in his Abbey of <HI>Pontoi&s;e,</HI> where he had always Peo|ple of his own choice, at his Table.

For while he was upon the Throne, he behaved him&s;elf rather like a private man, than a Soveraign; his chief care was to hoard up Money, without taking any pains to make Creatures and Friends to him&s;elf, and his Children. He never con&s;idered, how ne|ce&s;&s;ary the&s;e were, for placing one of his Po&s;terity upon the Throne, after his Death; or if he did con&s;ider this, he has thought, that they could al|ways make them&s;elves Friends, by the Trea&s;ures which he &s;hould leave them. And therefore, he &s;old all the Palatinates that came to be void; as well as every other thing, with which the for|mer Kings of <HI>Poland</HI> u&s;ed to gratifie the Nobi|lity and Gentry of that Kingdom. The&s;e Practices, had alienated the hearts of his Subjects from him, as well tho&s;e who had bought tho&s;e Places, as tho&s;e who expected to have had them in Gift, and with|out Money: So that, his Children were far from having any ground to hope, that they &s;hould have the &s;ame good fortune that Three &s;everal Families, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this Crown &s;ucce&s;&s;ively had formerly had; I mean the Families of <HI>Mamcllus, Jagellon</HI> and <HI>Pala|tin,</HI> who&s;e Children, &s;o long as they had any, &s;ucceeded to the Throne; &s;o that it did not pa&s;s into any other Family, than their own.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87">
However, the King having advice of all this, thought to place a Prince of his own Blood, upon that Throne, who was a Subject, and &s;uch a one too, as the <HI>Polanders</HI> mu&s;t always have to be their King. For they are a People that &s;oon de&s;pite their Prince, unle&s;s he be a brave Man, and capable to lead their Armies him&s;elf in Per&s;on, without which qualifica|tion, he has buy a melancholy Life among them.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of the <HI>Palatins</HI> who enjoyed that Crown, was an In&s;tance of this: And it's known, that this peo|ple, obliged him to apdicate, &s;o &s;oon as they per|ceived that his Conduct did not an&s;wer to that of his Ance&s;tors. The Prince whom the King pro|po&s;ed, was <HI>Francis Lewis de Bourbon</HI> Prince of <HI>Con|ti;</HI> who in this War, which his Maje&s;ty had main|tained again&s;t the greater part of <HI>Europe,</HI> has gi|ven &s;uch extraordinary Proofs of his Valour and Con|duct; that all the Army &s;aid openly, that the very Spirit and Soul of the late Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> his Un|cle, who was one of the greate&s;t Captains that ever <HI>France</HI> had, was return'd to this World, and had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Body, that he might &s;ave his King and his Country from the Confederacy that was formed again&s;t them. I know that this way of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, was altogether extraordinary and new; but as it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to expre&s;s more emphatically, the ju&s;t E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cem they had for that Prince, as a &s;in|gularly brave Man; &s;o this way of &s;peaking, pa&s;&s;ed &s;o currant, and was &s;o often repeated, that his Re|putation for true Courage, is e&s;tabli&s;hed in forreign Countries, as well as in <HI>France.</HI> Though this Prince is not rich, yet he &s;ent 200000 Crowns of his own Money into <HI>Poland,</HI> to gain the Suffrages of tho&s;e who had already Inclinations for him, on|ly upon the Account of his great Fame. For, as this is the only time of Harve&s;t with the great men of <HI>Poland,</HI> &s;o a Prince needs never pretend to their

Crown, unle&s;s he will &s;ow before hand, that they may reap the Fruits of it. The more that this Prince had of true merit, the more was <HI>Sobieski</HI>'s Widow-Queen, enraged again&s;t the King. She entertain'd hopes to have her elde&s;t Son Prince <HI>James,</HI> cho&s;en to &s;ucceed his Father; and for this very end, &s;he had married him to a Si&s;ter of the Empre&s;s's, and of the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI>'s, that he might have the Emperors A&s;&s;i&s;tance. But all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the World, being of no u&s;e in that Country, unle&s;s it be &s;upported with liberal Donatives, and &s;he being narrow and penurious that way, as her Husband was. The Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> would have &s;oon car|ried it again&s;t Prince <HI>James,</HI> had there been no o|ther Competitors for it.</P>
<P>The Queen of <HI>Poland</HI> finding, that &s;he could hard|ly &s;ucceed in her de&s;igns for her elde&s;t Son, en|deavoured to per&s;wade <HI>Mon&s;ieur l' Abbee de Polig|nac,</HI> the French Amba&s;&s;adour, to alter his mea|&s;ures, by offering, that if he would recommend the Duke <HI>de Vendome</HI> to be cho&s;en King, in&s;tead of the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> &s;he would unite her friends with his, upon condition, that the Duke, &s;hould marry her &s;o &s;oon as he was cho&s;en. At the &s;ame time, &s;he &s;ent two of her Sons to <HI>Paris,</HI> under pretence of travelling, but her true de&s;igns was, that they might be Spies at the French Court; and might &s;ee, if the King was in &s;uch a Condition to &s;upport the Prince of <HI>Conti's</HI> preten&s;ions, as the <HI>Abbee de Polignac</HI> pretended. For it was repor|ted in <HI>Poland,</HI> and almo&s;t in all foreign Countries, that <HI>France</HI> was drained both of Men and Money, and that it was &s;o far from being able for &s;uch an undertaking, that it was upon the brink of ruin, unle&s;s a peace was &s;peedily con|cluded. The <HI>Abbee de Polignac</HI> gave the King an account of the Queen of <HI>Polands</HI> Propo&s;als, but at the &s;ame time advi&s;ed him not to tru&s;t her.

faction joyn with that of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> than with the Prince of <HI>Conti's.</HI> For &s;he had &s;o far forgotten, that &s;he was a born Subject of <HI>France,</HI> that &s;he thought of nothing &s;o much, as how to embara&s;s all his Maje&s;ty's Projects and De&s;igns; In the mean time, the two Princes, <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> younger Brothers of Prince <HI>James,</HI> came into <HI>France</HI> And that they might make the French Court entertain a better Opinion of their Mother, than i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> did from the Account that the <HI>Abbee de Polignac</HI> had given of her, they brought along with them, near three Millions of Gold, and put Eight hundred thou|&s;and Crowns of it into the Town-Hou&s;e i. e. the Bank of <HI>Paris.</HI> The Queen of <HI>Poland</HI> de&s;igned by this, to let the world &s;ee &s;he had not renoun|ced <HI>France,</HI> as the <HI>Abbee de Polignac</HI> had in&s;inu|ated: And that &s;he was re&s;olved to &s;ettle her two Sons in that Kingdom, in ca&s;e they could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> with Honour. But be&s;ides, that this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;eemed for her intere&s;t, &s;he made al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;trantage by that Gold which &s;he had &s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> for as to its fineneis, it was much below the &s;tandard of the <HI>French</HI> Coyn, yet it was ta|ken into the Mint as if it had been the fine&s;t Gold in the world, for the King &s;tood &s;o much in need of Money, that he was content to take it as it was. When the&s;e two Princes were come to <HI>Paris,</HI> and to the Court, they were &s;oon convinced by the Luxury they &s;aw in both the&s;e Places, that the reports which had been indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread in <HI>Poland,</HI> were altogether fal&s;e. They betook them&s;elves to tho&s;e diver&s;ions that Prin|ces of their Age do u&s;ually entertain them&s;elves with: They went to all the Balls that they heard of, and there was one thing be&s;el them that de|&s;erves we &s;hould give an Account of it.</P>
<P>Being at one of the&s;e Balls, with Five or Six Gentlemen of their Retinue, who were Masked as
<PB N="89" REF="90">
well as them&s;elves, there was there one of the <HI>Mousquetaires</HI> of the Kings Hou&s;hold, who had put on the habit of a Coun&s;ellor, and was therewith Di&s;gui&s;ed. He chanced to meet with the young Princes, whom he did not know, and told them very Gravely, that it was to no purpo&s;e, that they &s;hould put them&s;elves to &s;o much trouble in a bu&s;ine&s;s wherein they could not &s;ucceed and therefore as their Coun&s;el he would &s;eriou&s;ly ad|vi&s;e them, to agree with their adver&s;ary, other|ways, they would be ca&s;t in their &s;uit. The two Princes had received letters from <HI>Poland,</HI> the day before, wherein they had the bad News, that the Queen their Mother de&s;paired of &s;ucceeding in her de&s;igns; and this News had &s;pread through the Town, &s;o that they never reflected, that this di&s;|cour&s;e was &s;aid Innocently and without any other de&s;ign, but that it might &s;uit with the Garb he had then put on; They Imagined on the other hand, that he had &s;poken with relation to the news they had received, and they were &s;o enra|ged again&s;t him, that they thought it not enough, to call him Villain and Rogue, and that he was but an in&s;olent Ra&s;cal, to behave, him&s;elf with &s;o little re&s;pect to them, but they al&s;o Ba&s;tinad'd him Soundly. The poor Coun&s;ellor, finding that he had but a bad cau&s;e to plead for him&s;elf, began to cry out, What do this to me, a <HI>Mou&s;quetaire,</HI> to me? as tho&s;e of the Company of <HI>Mou&s;quetaires</HI> u&s;e to do, when they find, that they have to deal with too &s;trong a party. But the Princes of <HI>Poland</HI> pulling off their Masks, that it might be known who they were, there was not &s;o much as one Per&s;on that would come to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the poor ba&s;tinado'd <HI>Mou&s;quetaire.</HI> He marched off with the blows he had received, and re&s;olved to complain to the King, from whom he expected more Ju&s;tice; No doubt he had rea|&s;on to demand it, and would certainly have ob|tained it, if he had had to do with tho&s;e of hit own
<PB N="90" REF="91">
Rank. But the Princes were before-hand with him in complaining to his Maje&s;ty. And he had the hard fortune to be &s;ent to pri&s;on, &s;o &s;oon as he offered to &s;peak of it. By this treatment, and by what he had before met with, he became &s;en|&s;ible, that it was not for his Intere&s;t, to take up a Trade that he had no skill in; and therefore he re&s;olved never to profe&s;s it any more, or if he did, he would never give coun&s;el but to tho&s;e who as|ked it of him. The one of the&s;e Princes was much hand&s;omer than the other. And the King was re&s;olved to give them the blew Ribban, <HI>i. e.</HI> to make them Knights of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> This was to do good for evil. For the Queen their Mother, never failed to do all that was in her Power, to traver&s;e his Maje&s;ty's De&s;igns. When they gave her Advice of this, &s;he &s;ent an Expre&s;s to them, and told them, that &s;he was &s;urprized to find, that they had &s;o much as li&s;tened to &s;uch a Propo&s;al; &s;ince they could not but know, that if they accepted of it, they &s;hould thereby act direct|ly contrary to the Intere&s;ts of their Family; that they knew how a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he was engaged in the Intere&s;t of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> and that they mu&s;t follow her Example, in adhering clo&s;ely to that Hou&s;e. By this it is manife&s;t, that &s;he had altogether forgot|ten her Native Country, ever &s;ince &s;he was put to it, to keep up the Splendour of her Childrens Family, by endeavouring to rai&s;e her Elde&s;t Son to Royal Dignity. The&s;e Princes having received the&s;e Orders from their Mother, gave the King thanks for the Honour he had offered to do them, but excu&s;ed them&s;elves for not accepting of it: They frequented the Balls as formerly, tho' they were &s;ometimes engaged in other Bu&s;ine&s;s; as par|ticularly with the Marquis <HI>de Coaquin,</HI> a Per&s;on of Quality in <HI>Brittany,</HI> who had but a little before, married one of the Mar&s;hal <HI>de Noaille</HI>'s Daugh|ters.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92">
This was no ill Match for him, e&s;pecially, &s;ee|ing the Mare&s;hal was &s;o much in favour. The King had given him the Command of his Army in <HI>Ca|talonia,</HI> though he was not a Man of &s;o much Ex|perience as many others; for except, that he had commanded &s;ome Troops, in the time of Peace; be|cau&s;e he was fir&s;t Captain of the Life-guards, all the Preferment he had come to, was to be <HI>Aide de Camp</HI> to His Maje&s;ty. But the King added yet another Honour to this, and made him Mare&s;hal of <HI>France,</HI> in the Year 1693. though no body could &s;ee, that he had done any great things to de|&s;erve &s;uch a Preferment. However, whether it be that His Maje&s;ty knows Peoples Merits better than others do; or if Fortune, which has favoured him in all his Undertakings, de&s;igned to approve of his Choice; this Mare&s;hal gained very &s;oon a con&s;ide|rable Battle: He had formerly taken the Towns of <HI>Ro&s;es</HI> and <HI>Gironne;</HI> and then it was &s;aid of him, that though he had not done any thing to de&s;erve the Mare&s;hal's Staff, when he fir&s;t received it; yet he had afterwards made it appear, that he was worthy of it. His Father who was one of Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI>'s Creatures, had been al&s;o a Captain of the Life-guards; and it was his Fortune to be rai|&s;ed to that Po&s;t when he was lea&s;t expecting it. It was in the King's Minority, and the Occa&s;ion of it was this: The Queen Mother had become jealous of the Count <HI>de Termes;</HI> who was provi|ded of the &s;ame Charge, &s;o that he was forced to remove from the King's Per&s;on, at a time when it was his Turn to have waited upon him. When he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, &s;he ordered that another Cap|tain of the Guards &s;hould take his <HI>Batton;</HI> but they had all promi&s;ed to one another, to do nothing to the Prejudice of their Fellow-Officer; for which the Count <HI>de Charo&s;t</HI> was bani&s;hed; and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Chandenier,</HI> was yet more unfortunate; for the Queen took his Commi&s;&s;ion from him, and gave
<PB N="92" REF="93">
it to the Mar&s;hal <HI>de Nouailles</HI>'s Father, &s;o that he was never able to recover it, though he lived a long time after. It was not for want of Time, that he could not &s;ucceed; nor was it for want of Conjunctures, that &s;eemed favourable enough for him, for he was of the &s;ame Family, that Ma|dam <HI>de Morte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">pan</HI> was of: And &s;ince he was not more guilty than the Count <HI>de Charo&s;t,</HI> who was &s;oon recalled from his Bani&s;hment, and made Duke and Peer of <HI>France;</HI> it may be &s;aid, that there is nothing in this World, but good or bad Fortune: For this Man was &s;o far from being in a wor&s;e condition becau&s;e of his Di&s;obedience; that he rai|&s;ed his Fortune to &s;uch a degree, that he could not de&s;ire to rai&s;e it higher; while the unfortu|nate Marquis <HI>de Chandinier,</HI> was quite undone with his Fall.</P>
<P>Tho' it be to the only late Duke <HI>de Nouailles,</HI> that his Family owes the pre&s;ent Greatne&s;s, to which it has arrived; yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that it is an ancient and honourable Family. I know that the pre&s;ent <HI>Madame de Bouillon,</HI> when &s;he was &s;triving for the Door with the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Nou|ailles,</HI> &s;poke of her and her Family with &s;o much Di&s;dain, that if her Word could have been taken for it, the Family of <HI>Nouailles</HI> &s;hould have been thought a very de&s;picable one: I know al&s;o, that &s;he produced &s;ome old Papers, by which it was found, that one <HI>Anthony de Nouailles,</HI> had been Steward of the Hou&s;e, to the Vi&s;count <HI>de Turenne;</HI> but as Stewards of the Hou&s;e at that time, were u&s;ually Gentlemen, and as there are younger Brothers of good Families, who are forced to conde&s;cend to meaner things than he did; &s;o that One In&s;tance, ought not to give us any mean Opinion of that Family, which is certainly very noble and very ancient. And it cannot to be &s;aid, that the Mar|quis <HI>de Coaquin</HI> match'd below his Quality; when he married a Daughter of it, though it be true,
<PB N="93" REF="94">
that his Family has &s;ometimes made greater Al|liances: For not to go far back, his Mother was <HI>Rohan Chabot,</HI> and his Grandmother <HI>Orleans Lon|gueville.</HI> He had a great E&s;tate in <HI>Brittany,</HI> which his Mother re&s;igned in his favour, as &s;he did al|mo&s;t every thing &s;he could claim by her Marriage-Contract, and for her Dowry. For this is a La|dy of extraordinary Virtue, and &s;o &s;oon as &s;he had put her Affairs in order, &s;he re&s;olved to re|tire into a Convent, and re&s;erved nothing to her|&s;elf, but 10000 Livres <HI>per Ann.</HI> which was by ve|ry much le&s;s than what &s;he had a Right to, if &s;he had exacted &s;o much as &s;he might have done. Her Son was but 18 Years old, when he married <HI>Mada|moi&s;elle de Nouailles,</HI> but he was as tall a Man as he could expect to be at 25; and his Mother im|portuned him to take a Wife, becau&s;e he was the only Child his Father had left. This Lady had not been very happy in her Marriage, though &s;he was of an agreeable Complexion, and of a very good Air, yet &s;he had not &s;o much Beauty as to plea&s;e her Husband; and &s;ince &s;he knew by her own Expe|rience, what Di&s;gu&s;ts Husbands u&s;e to take at their Wives, when they are not altogether agreeable; &s;he ought at lea&s;t to have cho&s;en an hand&s;ome La|dy for her Son, that he might not fall into the &s;ame Immoralities, that her Husband had done. But this was what &s;he had thought lea&s;t of, and &s;he had &s;oon rea&s;on to repent of it. For upon the Morrow after the Marriage, when &s;ome of her Sons Friends came to pay him their Compliments, upon that Occa&s;ion; he could not forbear telling them, that they needed not give them&s;elves that trouble; that his Mother had cho&s;en a Dwarf for him, in&s;tead of a Wife: That it &s;eem'd &s;he who was a devout Lady, had made this Choice, be|cau&s;e the Duke <HI>de Nouailles</HI> was devout al&s;o. But for his part, he wi&s;h'd his Wife more &s;o than either of them; that he might not be troubled with ly|ing
<PB N="94" REF="95">
with her: And that he was re&s;olved henceforth to treat her as a Relique; that is, that he &s;hould never come near her, but upon Holy Days. From that day he gave &s;uch Proofs of his want of Affection to her, that all the Family took notice of it: They all con&s;ulted, what was fit to be done in &s;uch a Ca&s;e; that <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Coaquin,</HI> might not engage him&s;elf in tho&s;e lewd Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">es, that Hu&s;|bands u&s;e to betake them&s;elves to, when they come to de&s;pi&s;e their Wives. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who is the Mare&s;hal's Brother, was called among the fir&s;t, to give Advice in this matter: And they all agreed, that becau&s;e the new mar|ried Lady was pale as Death, which made her the more di&s;agreeable to her Husband, it was there|fore nece&s;&s;ary to find out &s;ome Expedient, to give her a better Colour, they had recour&s;e to Painting, which is highly e&s;teem'd among the Ladies, who by daubing their Faces with white and red, make them&s;elves look to be of as fine Complexions as they plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e. But many of the more &s;crupulous &s;ort of People, were &s;urpri&s;ed, when they heard, that &s;o good a Man as this Prelate, and &s;o de|vout a Lady as the Dowager of <HI>Nouailles,</HI> had advi&s;ed &s;uch a thing as that. But though the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Nouailles,</HI> did not only cau&s;e this Lady's Face to be painted with white and red, but al&s;o cau&s;ed Shooes to be made for her, with Heels that were a Quarter of an Ell high, that &s;he might thereby appear &s;o much the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">; yet &s;he was as unlovely in the Eyes of her Husband, as &s;he had been before; nay, he thought her the more ugly, upon this very account; in&s;omuch that in&s;tead of conver&s;ing with her, he entreated his Friends, who &s;poke to him &s;ometimes of her and of his Father in Law, that if they would oblige him, they would not &s;o much as &s;peak either ill or good of them. In the mean time, he endeavoured to comfort him&s;elf, as well
<PB N="95" REF="96">
as he could with good cheer, and in the Com|pany of &s;ome Ladies, whom he vi&s;ited, not upon the account of any familiar conver&s;e, but that he delighted to vex them, and they were never more out of humour, than when they &s;aw him come into their Company, &s;o that they would gladly have gone out at the Window, to &s;hun any conver&s;e with him, if they could have done it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mare&s;hal de Nouailles</HI> who has had more than twenty Children by his Lady, though &s;he be not to this time much above forty years, had as yet another daughter to marry, there was a great difference between her and <HI>Madam de Coaquin.</HI> The one was as agreeable, as the other was deformed; which made one &s;ay to the Marquis <HI>de Coaquin,</HI> that the Mare&s;hal had given him <HI>Leah,</HI> but had kept <HI>Rachel.</HI> There was abundance of young Gentlemen who were Suitors to this new <HI>Rachel,</HI> both becau&s;e her Father was much in favour at Court; and becau&s;e &s;he her&s;elf was &s;o great a Beauty: The Count <HI>d' E&s;trees</HI> (who came to be happier than the re&s;t; for it was he that married her;) was of the number of tho&s;e who made their Addre&s;&s;es to her. His Ambition carried him to this, as much as any thing el&s;e. He con&s;idered, that though he was of a Family, which is in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of more Honours, in the Per&s;on of his Father and his two Uncles, than any other Family is, yet that was no|thing to him, unle&s;s he could attain to the like Ho|nours: For tho' his Fathers elder Brother was Duke and Peer of <HI>France,</HI> and that his Son had &s;ucceeded to him in the &s;ame Honours, and though his Fa|ther was Mare&s;hal of <HI>France,</HI> and his Uncle a Car|dinal, yet he him&s;elf had no Place or Rank at Court, and was only con&s;idered there, as a Per&s;on of Qua|lity, as Ten Thou&s;and others are. So that he &s;aw nothing that could &s;atisfie his Ambition, unle&s;s he went aboard of the Fleet, where he would be obliged to &s;ignalize him&s;elf, becau&s;e he had the Sur|vivance
<PB N="96" REF="97">
of the Office of Vice-Admiral, which his Father was in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of: His Uncle the Car|dinal, who had a greater Kindne&s;s for him, that for the Duke <HI>d' E&s;trees,</HI> though he was his Nephew as well as he, and by his elder Brother too, ad+vi&s;ed him to this Marriage; and he u&s;ed his ut+mo&s;t Endeavours to bring it about, as the only means whereby he might be made a Duke, as his Cou&s;in was. And he was &s;o earne&s;t in this Affair that he &s;ent Word to the Duke <HI>de Nouailles,</HI> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> if he could pre&s;ume &s;o much upon his favour, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to employ him to procure a Dukes Patent to his Nephew, he &s;hould marry his Daughter without one Farthing of Portion: And he promi&s;ed al&s;o to make him his Heir, and to make the Inheritance as good as he could.

For want of this, they re&s;olved upon all hands to deal with one <HI>Madame de Thoi&s;t,</HI> a rich Lady; &s;he was the Widow of a <HI>Ma&icirc;ere de Comptes,</HI> and &s;he had lent a con&s;iderable Sum to the <HI>Cardinal d' E&s;trees,</HI> and was not payed of it: And be&s;ides, &s;he was a Friend of the Duke and Dutche&s;s <HI>de Nouailles;</HI> and be|cau&s;e &s;he had no Children, they told her &s;o often, that &s;he ought to adopt <HI>Madamoi&s;elle de Nouailles,</HI> for her Daughter, that though they could not pre|vail with her to leave her all her E&s;tate, yet they per&s;waded her to do &s;omething for her. And &s;he offered at la&s;t, to give her what the Cardinal <HI>d' E|&s;trees</HI> owed her. But becau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e they would have more, the matter is put off to this time; for &s;he will not give away all her E&s;tate in her own Life-time; yet &s;he promi&s;es, that be&s;ides the Sum which the Cardinal owes her, which &s;he is willing to part with pre&s;ently, &s;he &s;hall al&s;o con&s;ider this young Lady in her Will; &s;o that &s;he &s;hall be &s;ure of &s;omething more at her Death. That which &s;ell out between the Princes of <HI>Poland</HI> and the Marquis <HI>de Coaquin,</HI> was not at all for his Advantage; if we may be|lieve what is commonly reported.

But he en|tertains Per&s;ons of Quality, who are of the French Nation, as Magnificently, as he does &s;trangers. There is not a Man about the Court that regales our Princes and Prince&s;&s;es &s;o often, as he does, and he has got into a Cu&s;tom, of providing a Collation for the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> as often as he comes to the Opera. It is but of late that he was in a condition to ac|quit him&s;elf well in &s;uch an undertaking, for though his Father who was once but a poor man, and of mean extract, made up &s;ome &s;mall e&s;tate to him, yet it was far from being &s;ufficient for &s;uch co&s;tly Entertainments. He has rai&s;ed his E&s;tate by gaming; which has put him in a condition to build &s;o many fine Hou&s;es, and by which, he has &s;o great yearly Revenues. And con&s;idering the fir&s;t years of his gaming, and now that he is become rich, it may be &s;aid of him, what was once &s;aid to the Pre&s;ident <HI>Belli|evre</HI> by one that de&s;igned to flatter him. I confe&s;s that the beginning of this Di&s;cour&s;e would be in&s;ipid, but that it is agreeable to the fir&s;t beginnings of his fortune, and that the la&s;t part of it would be im|pertinent, but that it &s;uits with his pre&s;ent Cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>This Pre&s;ident, who was the chief Man in the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> had always &s;ome Debate with <HI>Cardinal Mazarin,</HI> whom he did not much E|&s;teem, and it may be, the <HI>Cardinal</HI> had as little E|&s;teem for him, and perhaps he was in the right too. However, the Man I ju&s;t now &s;poke of, knowing, what Opinion this Chief Pre&s;ident had of his Emi|nence; &s;aid to him once, whil&s;t they were &s;pea|king of him, that no great Account was to be made of &s;uch Men, who&s;e fortunes were volatile, and what &s;how &s;oever they made, yet they were
<PB N="99" REF="100">
but like glaring meteors, which di&s;appear'd in a &s;hort time. But on the other hand, he &s;aid that the Pre&s;idents fortune was built upon a rock, and that he mu&s;t be a Man of very little &s;en&s;e, who did not &s;ee a great difference, between the one and the other. We may ea&s;ily perceive, that the Man who &s;poke &s;o, was be&s;t acquainted with old cu&s;toms, &s;ince he magnified a chief Pre&s;ident &s;o much, and undervalued a chief Mini&s;ter. And at mo&s;t it is only during a Kings minority, that this way of rea&s;oning will hold good. But now a days, he &s;hould be accounted a Mad-man, or one that had returned from the other world, that would &s;peak at &s;uch a rate. In a word, if <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Langlees</HI> fortune, might have been compared to a Meteor, while his high &s;pending was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ounded only upon what he gained at game, yet he has now &s;ettled it upon &s;o many fair Buildings, in <HI>Paris</HI> and in the Country, that we may &s;ay, what the Man &s;aid to the Pre&s;ident, that he had now foun|ded it upon a Rock. <HI>Madame la Marqui&s;e de Be|thunes,</HI> who is the Queen of <HI>Polands</HI> Si&s;ter, gave al&s;o a Magnificent Entertainment to the two Princes her Nephews. There were many Per&s;ons of Quality, of both Sexes, at this fea&s;t, and it en|ded with a &s;plendid Ball. Yet this Marchione&s;s is not at all rich, nay &s;he's very poor to be &s;i&s;ter of a Queen; yet it was her own fault, that &s;he had not a better e&s;tate. For when her husband was Amba&s;&s;adour in <HI>Poland,</HI> the Queen her Si&s;ter was re&s;olved to make her rich; But &s;he became jea|lous, that the Queen was in love with her husband, and that it was for his &s;ake, that &s;he made &s;o kind Offers. Her jealou&s;ie made her commit a thou|&s;and follies, which &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed that Court, that her Husband dying there, all that &s;he brought to <HI>France</HI> from that Country, was a gift of a hundred thou&s;and Crowns, which the Late King of <HI>Poland</HI> gave her, upon the E&s;tate of the Late Duke <HI>de Longueville.</HI></P>
<P>This Monarch had lent this Money, while he
<PB N="100" REF="101">
was but great <HI>Mare&s;hal</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> and when the Duke <HI>de Longueville</HI> was a&s;piring to that Crown. But his Si&s;ter the <HI>Dutche&s;s de Nemours</HI> refu&s;ed to pay it, as well as all the other &s;ums, which he had borrowed at that time, that he might attain to Royal dignity. She pretended, that her brother was under age, when he borrowed the&s;e &s;ums, and therefore, &s;he was not obliged to pay them. This gave occa&s;ion to a Law &s;uit, before the Coun|cil, and it appeared intricate and doubtful. For the Law forbids to lend Money to Minors; unle&s;s it be manife&s;tly for their advantage, and therefore. <HI>So|bie&s;ky</HI> ought to lo&s;e his Money; becau&s;e the Duke was not of age when he borrowed it. But the <HI>Marchione&s;s de Bethunes,</HI> as well as the Dukes other Creditors, an&s;wered to this, that what might be con&s;idered in the ca&s;e of ordinary Loans, ought not to be con&s;idered in &s;uch an extraordinary ca&s;e as this was, when the borrower of the Money, de&s;igned to employ it for obtaining a Crown; and that this had been always the Opinion of the Prince of <HI>Condee,</HI> who while he was alive, was &s;till de&s;i|rous that <HI>Mon&s;ieur l' Abbee d' Orleans,</HI> who was Brother and heir to the decea&s;ed Duke <HI>de Lon|gueville,</HI> &s;hould pay punctually the full intere&s;t, of all the Money that had been Borrowed upon that Account That it was he, who took care of all the Affairs of the Family of <HI>Longueville,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>L' Abbe d' Orleans,</HI> who was the Duke's elder Brother was but a weak Man, and unfit for Bu&s;ine&s;s. That, their Si&s;ter the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Nemours</HI> dared not to have &s;poken any thing again&s;t the payment of tho&s;e debts, &s;o long as her Brother was alive. But now that he was dead, and that the Prince of <HI>Condee,</HI> who had always &s;upported the Claim of the Creditors, was dead al&s;o; &s;he who loved Cavils and litigious de|bates, had brought them to the Trouble and Ex|pence of a Law Suit. It was fir&s;t debated before the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> but at la&s;t it was brought before
<PB N="101" REF="102">
the Kings Council. Either becau&s;e the affair was of importance, or that it ought in cour&s;e of Law to have been carried thither. And it was truly the Kings Intere&s;t to take cogni&s;ance of it him&s;elf, e&s;|pecially at &s;uch a Juncture as that was, for it was his concern to gain the Polanders to the Prince of <HI>Conti's</HI> Intere&s;t, and not to give them cau&s;e to com|plain, that they were cheated by the Duke <HI>de Lon|gueville,</HI> who had borrowed Money of <HI>Sobie&s;ky,</HI> and of &s;everal other Per&s;ons of Quality among them. Therefore the King Ordered the <HI>Marquis de Bar|be&s;ieux</HI> to con&s;ider the ca&s;e, and to report it fully in his Pre&s;ence. For the Secretaries of his Maje&s;ty's Commands, of which this <HI>Marquis</HI> is one, are al&s;o Coun&s;ellors of &s;tate, and have the &s;ame Com|mi&s;&s;ions, &s;o that the King may Charge them with all &s;orts of bu&s;ine&s;s, as he can do any of the re&s;t of that number. But after &s;ome days, his Maje&s;ty con&s;idered, that &s;o young a man as the <HI>Marquis de Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> was &s;carcely capable of an affair of &s;uch importance; and that an old and experienced Coun|&s;ellor of &s;tate, would be much fitter for it. He therefore took it out of the <HI>Marquis</HI>'s hands, and Committed it to <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Ribere.</HI> But <HI>Madame de Nemours's</HI> Council had found &s;o many &s;hifts, that this has been put off from time to time, and is not as yet determined. Yet it is believed that &s;he will be ca&s;t in it, as &s;he was in another Law-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uit, which &s;he had again&s;t the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> before the <HI>Requetes du Palais.</HI> This ca&s;e was of yet grea|ter importance than the former; and there were &s;ome Circum&s;tances in it, that were very con&s;ide|rable, and therefore I &s;hall give a full Account of it.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur l' Abbe d' Orleans,</HI> whom I ju&s;t now mentioned, having renounced his right of Primo|geniture, in favour of the <HI>Comte de St. Paul</HI> his younger Brother, who thereafter took the Title of
<PB N="102" REF="103">
Duke <HI>de Longueville,</HI> he was in a &s;hort time re&s;tored to all his rights, by the Death of that Prince, who like a fool, was the Occa&s;ion of his own Death, as he was pa&s;sing the <HI>Rhine. Mon&s;ieur l Abbee</HI> was wil|ling to have made over the whole E&s;tate to his Uncle the Prince of <HI>Condee;</HI> but this Prince, who enjoy|ed eighteen hundred thou&s;and Livres of yearly revenue, thought, that he had already more than was &s;ufficient to make him happy, if Riches alone can make us &s;o; and therefore he advi&s;ed him to give it to his Mother, <HI>Madame de Longueville,</HI> who had more need of it than he. The <HI>Abbee</HI> was a man that did every thing he was advi&s;ed to, e&s;pecially if the Advice came from a Per&s;on of Authority, like the Prince <HI>de Condee:</HI> &s;o that he agreed, that tho&s;e who managed his affairs, &s;hould draw up his will, and that he &s;hould &s;ign it. It was done as the Prince of <HI>Condee</HI> was plea&s;ed to order it, and the <HI>Abbee</HI> altered not &s;o much as one word in it. By this will he gave over the Principality of <HI>Neufchatel</HI> in <HI>Suitzerland</HI> with &s;ome other po&s;se&s;sions, to his Mother the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Longueville</HI> during her Life. But af|ter her Death the Prince of <HI>Condee</HI> had Right to them by the &s;ame will, if no new will &s;hould be made. But he who had already refu&s;ed them, was re&s;olved not to make any advantage of the <HI>Abbees</HI> will for the future, and therefore, he cau&s;ed his right to be made over to the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> after the Death of the Dutche&s;s. The Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> had need of a good E&s;tate, for his Fathers Marriage was di&s;ad|vantageous for his Fortune, as well as for his Honour. He had re&s;igned the <HI>Abbacy</HI> of <HI>St. Denis,</HI> with many other good benefices, for the &s;ake of a Niece of Cardi|nal <HI>Mazarins,</HI> who was truely a Virtuous Lady, but her Uncle gave her nothing in Marriage, though he had &s;o pillaged <HI>France,</HI> that he might have given her a great E&s;tate, without pinching him&s;elf in the lea&s;t. Yet he had promi&s;ed him Mountains of Gold, as he always u&s;ed to do, when he had a de&s;ign to co|zen
<PB N="103" REF="104">
any body, but having dealt by her and her Hu&s;|band as he u&s;ually did by all tho&s;e, with whom he had any bu&s;ine&s;s, though he might at lea&s;t have put &s;ome difference between him and others, both upon the Account of his Quality, and becau&s;e his Niece was Married to him. This Prince died very poor for a Per&s;on of his Rank. However The Dutche&s;s <HI>de Nemours</HI> being informed of the Will, which her Brother had made, importuned him &s;o, as that &s;he prevailed with him after the Prince of <HI>Condees</HI> Death, to make it void; and to make another will, by which he left the whole Inheritance to her. Now this <HI>Abbee</HI> dying &s;oon after, and the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> pretending, that the will which had been made in his favour, ought to prevail again&s;t this La&s;t will, the <HI>Requetes du Palais</HI> were the proper Judges, in the fir&s;t point of the controver&s;ie. The Rea&s;ons of his plea, were, that <HI>Mon&s;ieur l' Abbee d' Orleans</HI> was <HI>non Compos</HI> when he made the La&s;t will, &s;o that it ought to be con&s;idered as if &s;uch a thing had never been done. If <HI>Madame de Nemours</HI> had been well advi&s;ed, &s;he would have &s;aid the &s;ame of him when he made his fir&s;t will, and &s;he would have had no difficulty in proving it; &s;o that the fir&s;t being no better than the &s;econd, &s;he &s;hould have &s;ucceeded by law, to the whole E&s;tate; without any &s;entence in her favour, becau&s;e &s;he was his &s;i&s;ter. But her Council it &s;eems was as Vi&s;ionary, as tho&s;e who live beyond the <HI>Alps,</HI> who plead for the Popes Infallibility. They maintain'd, that the Te&s;tator was &s;ound in his Judgment, when he made the &s;e|cond will, whereby the fir&s;t was made void. And they had no other way to prove this, but by the Popes Infallibility, who had put him into Prie&s;ts orders, at the very time, that he made this &s;econd will. And they alledged, that it could not be &s;uppo|&s;ed, that the Pope would have ordained him Prie&s;t, if he had not been in his right wits. And they thought this &s;o good a Rea&s;on, that they could not conceive,
<PB N="104" REF="105">
how it could have been an&s;wered. So that they neglected all other rea&s;ons, and adhered only to this one, to &s;upport their Cau&s;e. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> de&s;ired, he might be allowed to prove, that the <HI>Ab|bee</HI> was <HI>nonCompos</HI> when he made his la&s;t Will, which he offered to do by Evidences that could not be excepted again&s;t. He was allowed to prove it, and he pro|duced his Evidences, upon who&s;e Depo&s;ition the whole Cau&s;e depended. The Que&s;tion was, if <HI>Mon|&s;ieur l' Abbee d'Orleans</HI> was &s;ound in his Judgment, when he made his &s;econd Will. But there was no great diffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ulty to re&s;olve this Que&s;tion, for there were Evidences that told things of him, that could not have been &s;aid of any Man, but one that was fit for a Bedlam. And among other things they de|po&s;ed, that when he was going to &s;ay Ma&s;s, the fir&s;t time after he was ordained Prie&s;t; he &s;topped when he came near to the Rails, which u&s;ually &s;eparates the Sanctuary and the Altar from the <HI>Neve</HI> of the Church, and there he tried if he could jump over the Rails, with his Feet clo&s;e together. They de|po&s;ed al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hat when he found he was not able to do it, he came back about 20 Pac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">, that he might give him&s;elf more Force by running; and in this mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> the Holy Sacri|fice unto God Almighty; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ve a Thou|&s;and other Proofs of his being a Fool, an Account of which wou'd be too tedious. <HI>Madam de Nemour's</HI> Council were a&s;ton &s;hed, when they heard the Evi|dences depo&s;e &s;uch things as the&s;e, and they wi&s;hed then, that they had not relied &s;o much upon the Popes Infallibility, and that they had taken better mea|&s;ures, but it was now too late. The Judges pro|ceeded to pronounce a Sentence, by which that Prince, the <HI>Abbee,</HI> was declared to have been <HI>non compos,</HI> when he made his &s;econd Will.</P>
<P>Although the City of <HI>Paris,</HI> and all the Court were overjoyed, when they heard that the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> whom they lov'd &s;o dearly had gain'd his
<PB N="105" REF="106">
Cau&s;e; yet <HI>Madame de Nemours</HI> appealed to the <HI>Grand Chambre,</HI> where &s;he is &s;till pro&s;ecuting it; but no body doubts, but that the Sentence which was pronounced, will be confirmed by a Decree. Some time before this Sentence was pronounced, <HI>Madame de Nemours</HI> acted her part very dexte|rou&s;ly, and like a Lady of good Conduct: She knew, that &s;he had a &s;trong Party to deal with, in her Law-&s;uit; and therefore, as her Brother's Heire&s;s, &s;he had given the Principality of <HI>Neufchatel</HI> to the <HI>Chevalier de Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> a Ba&s;tard Son of the late Count <HI>de Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> who was a Prince of the Blood, and her Uncle: For &s;he was the Daughter of one of his Si|&s;ters; who was married to the Duke <HI>de Longueville</HI> her Father, and after who&s;e Death, he married the Prince of <HI>Condee</HI>'s Si&s;ter. Now, when &s;he gave this Principality to this <HI>Chevalier,</HI> &s;he had obliged him to marry the Mar&s;hal <HI>de Luxenbourg</HI>'s Daughter; hoping that the need the Kingdom had of the Services of &s;o great a Captain, in &s;o formidable a War, as it had to maintain again&s;t &s;o many Enemies, would give her an Intere&s;t with the King, &s;ufficient to balance the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s. But this Mar&s;hal died to his Daughter's great Lo&s;s, before that the Sen|tence which I have given an account of, was pro|nounced; So that the Hopes vani&s;hed, which <HI>Ma|dame de Nemours</HI> had comforted her&s;elf with, when &s;he contrived that Marriage. Though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, &s;he took very good mea&s;ures to bring about her De&s;igns. But there was &s;omething in it, that was &s;till wor&s;e for the <HI>Chevalier de Soi&s;&s;ons;</HI> for he had re&s;igned a good Abbacy that he might marry a Lady, who was neither rich nor hand&s;ome, and he had al&s;o taken the Title of Prince of <HI>Neuf|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hatel,</HI> when he was upon the point of lo&s;ing the Principality.</P>
<P>Though the gaining of this Cau&s;e, was for the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Advantage, yet it was nothing in compari&s;on of the Crown of <HI>Poland;</HI> which per|haps
<PB N="106" REF="107">
the King had obliged him to think of, more than he would have done, had he followed his own Inclinations: For he was become pa&s;&s;ionately in love with a Lady of great Quality; In&s;omuch, that tho' a Crown be &s;o con&s;iderable, as that it de&s;erves to be preferred to all other things; yet he &s;eem'd not to to be too much concerned with it, le&s;t he &s;hould have been obliged to quit his Mi&s;tre&s;s. But it was quite otherwi&s;e with <HI>Madame</HI> the Prince&s;s of <HI>Conti;</HI> the thing in the World &s;he wi&s;hed mo&s;t was, that her Husband might be a King: Ambition, which is natural to Per&s;ons of her Rank and Quality, made her pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;irous of this; but be&s;ides, &s;he hoped, that the Crown of <HI>Poland</HI> would take off her Husband, from the Affection he had for the o|ther Lady; which yet &s;he dur&s;t not complain of, for fear of di&s;plea&s;ing him, and for &s;ome other Rea|&s;ons that mu&s;t not be publi&s;hed. However, this De&s;ign for the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> met with great Oppo&s;ition, and as the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> was mind|ful of its own Concerns in the pre&s;ent Juncture of the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> that it might by all means procure that Crown to one, who would clo&s;ely ad|here to its Intere&s;ts. So the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> was not the only Per&s;on, that was in Competition for it, with Prince <HI>James.</HI> Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> Ge|neral of the Imperial Forces, and who&s;e Merits were not much &s;hort of his own, was al&s;o one of the Competitors; and King <HI>William</HI> &s;eemed to fa|vour his Pretentions again&s;t Prince <HI>James;</HI> but this was only a &s;ort of Phantome, which was brought forth upon the Theatre, to frighten the Actors, while his Imperial Maje&s;ty had re&s;olved un|der-hand in his Cabinet-council, to cau&s;e the Ele|ctor of <HI>Saxony</HI> to be cho&s;en, who for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, had been clo&s;ely in his Intere&s;ts, and comman|ded his Forces in <HI>Hungary,</HI> This Elector was a man of true Courage, as well as the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> and Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden;</HI> &s;o that the <HI>Po|landers</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="108">
could not refu&s;e him upon that Score: For they are People, who will not have a King, but one that is capable both by Courage and Conduct, to head their Armies in Per&s;on, when it comes to fighting. But the great difficulty that they had to remove was, that he was a <HI>Lutheran;</HI> and this &s;eem'd a very great one, becau&s;e among the ma|ny Laws, that the <HI>Polanders</HI> have made, for the Government of their Kingdom, they have e&s;tabli|&s;hed this, for an unalterable one; that no Man &s;hall be cho&s;en King of <HI>Poland,</HI> but he who is of the <HI>Roman</HI> Communion. And therefore, when the Em|peror communicated his De&s;igns to the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> of advancing him to the Throne of that Kingdom; he in&s;inuated to him at the &s;ame time, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity for him to change his Religion: At la&s;t, whether it was that he had but little Religion, as ordinarily the Great Men of the World have but a &s;mall &s;hare of it, or if it may be imputed to any other cau&s;e, I do not know; but he not only agreed to do what was de&s;ired of him, but he al&s;o abjured it privately, before the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Javarin;</HI> yet he did not this, till he &s;aw, that there was a Party in <HI>Poland</HI> formed for him, which was capable to put the Crown on his Head: The De&s;igns of this Party were kept &s;o &s;ecret, that <HI>Mon&s;ieur L' Abbee de Polignac,</HI> had not the lea&s;t notice of them, but continued to believe, that he had no body to grapple with, but Prince <HI>James,</HI> whom he was not much afraid of, becau&s;e of his di&s;obli|ging Conduct: And the People were generally of Opinion, that he would follow his Example in too many things. So that <HI>Mon&s;ieur L' Abbee</HI> wrote to the <HI>French</HI> Court, that he hoped in a &s;hort time to bring the whole matter to an happy I&s;&s;ue. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cujavia,</HI> whom the whole Hou&s;e of <HI>Au|&s;tria</HI> did chiefly rely on, for making its De&s;igns effectual; being afraid that he &s;hould not be &s;ucce&s;sful, becau&s;e all the People had &s;o great an
<PB N="108" REF="109">
E&s;teem for the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> and e&s;pecially the Ladies, who all de&s;ired him for their King; thought it be&s;t to deal craftily in this matter, and to ma|nage it to the be&s;t advantage he could for him&s;elf, when he found that he was at the Head of a Fa|ction, that at lea&s;t might make the <HI>French</HI> Em|ba&s;&s;adour jealous of him, tho' it was not as yet &s;o &s;trong as his own. He cau&s;ed it to be told him under-hand, that if he de&s;ired that he might not cro&s;s his De&s;igns, it was in his Power to hinder him from doing it. That he knew he a&s;pired to be a Cardinal, and that he con&s;idered, that the only way how he could attain to that Dignity, was by his being &s;ucce&s;sful in his Negotiations for the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> But if he would renounce all Pretentions in his favour, he would joyn Intere&s;ts and unite Factions with him, by which means the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> would be infallibly &s;ecured to that Prince. No good Subject would have refu&s;ed what this Bi|&s;hop de&s;ired, though perhaps no Man would have yielded to it, but with &s;ome Reluctancy. But <HI>Mon|fieur L'Abbee</HI> &s;corned to hearken to &s;uch a Propo&s;al, and did not &s;o much as communicate it to the <HI>French</HI> Court, but pur&s;ued his former De&s;igns; while the Bi&s;hop &s;trengthned his Faction, by bringing over into it, the Party that had been for Prince <HI>James;</HI> for his Mother the Queen of <HI>Poland,</HI> was &s;o enraged again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> becau&s;e they had traver&s;ed all her De&s;igns for her Son; that &s;he had rather the <HI>Polan|ders</HI> &s;hould chu&s;e any other Man than the Prince of <HI>Conti;</HI> &s;o little did &s;he remember the Place of her Birth, or that the King of <HI>France</HI> had been &s;o in&s;tru|mental as he was in the Election of the late King her Husband. Yet among all the Factions that were a|mong the Palatinates, there was one thing in which they all agreed, that what Per&s;on &s;oever they &s;hould chu&s;e for King, he &s;hould purcha&s;e their Suffrages with good round Summs of Money; &s;o that the 200000 Crowns, which the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> had &s;ent
<PB N="109" REF="110">
into that Country, was but as a drop of Oyl in a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Fire; but the King &s;upplied his Indigence, and &s;ent thither at one time and another 4000000 of Crowns. The Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> borrowed Money with both Hands, from &s;everal Princes; that he might &s;atisfie the covetous De&s;ires of the <HI>Polanders;</HI> and King <HI>William</HI> lent him great Sums as well as the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg:</HI> In the mean while, this Prince made &s;ome of his Troops march toward the Confines of the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s Dominions, that lie neare&s;t to <HI>Po|land;</HI> as if there had been &s;ome Difference between them, and the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> took Occa&s;ion from that to carry his own Troops out of <HI>Hungary,</HI> under pretence to defend his Dominions again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Brandenburg.</HI> But all this marching of Troops on both &s;ides, was only that they might join their Forces together in ca&s;e of need; that is, in ca&s;e there &s;hould be a double Election, as there was great ap|pearance of it; that &s;o the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> might make good his Election by Force of Arms.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were doing, the Prince of <HI>Con|ti</HI> diverted him&s;elf the be&s;t way he could, as if he had not in the lea&s;t been concerned in any Bu&s;ine&s;s of Importance. He &s;poke of buying a Hou&s;e at <HI>Berci,</HI> as the Dukes <HI>de Chaulnes</HI> and <HI>de Ge&s;vres</HI> had done; for each of them had one in that Town: The Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI> who has that in common with many other Per&s;ons of Quality, that he does not always &s;peak truth hearing him &s;peak of a particular Hou&s;e, that belonged to one of the Farmers of the King's Reve|nues, who&s;e Name
 was&mdash;with which he &s;aid he was very well plea&s;ed; offered immediately to deal effectually with the Landlord, and that the Prince &s;hould have a good Bargain on't: And that he might believe, that he could per&s;wade the Farmer to do any thing, he told the Prince, that if he pleas'd to &s;up in that Hou&s;e to morrow night, he would oblige the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e to provide a Supper for him, and then he &s;hould have an Opportunity to &s;ee the
<PB N="110" REF="111">
whole Contrivance, and all the Conveniencies of the Hou&s;e. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> was well plea&s;ed with the Propo&s;al; and told him that he was engag'd to be with the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Bouillon</HI> at that time; but he would rather di&s;engage him&s;elf than mi&s;s &s;uch an Opportunity: So they made an Appointment at that Hou&s;e, to morrow in the Evening. But while the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> was at Dinner, the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI> &s;ent to tell him, that the Appointment could not be kept, becau&s;e the Landlord, who was not accu&s;to|med to entertain Princes of the Blood in his Hou&s;e, was con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ounded with the Thoughts of it: as for him|&s;elf, he was re&s;olved to take the Advantage of that Di&s;appointment, and that if the Prince was plea&s;ed to put off the Appointment till to morrow, he would do him&s;elf the honour to entertain him at dinner in the &s;ame Hou&s;e, with Seven or Eight of his Friends; &s;uch as he &s;hould chu&s;e. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> &s;aid to the Man who brought him this Me&s;&s;age, that he thank'd the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI> for it, and that he ac|cepted of it, and would be timely at the Hou&s;e to morrow, that he might have time to take a full View of it and con&s;ider it. He invited the Mar|quis <HI>de Coa&s;tin,</HI> the Pre&s;ident <HI>de Me&s;mes, Mon&s;ieur Caumartin,</HI> and &s;ome other Per&s;ons of Quality, to go along with him; but on the Morrow's morning came another from the Duke to make an Apology, that he could not wait upon him as he had promi&s;ed, be|cau&s;e of &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s of Importance, that had un|expectedly fallen out, and which he was obliged to look after. But there was not &s;o much as one Word of all this true: He did not &s;o much as know the Man to whom the Hou&s;e belonged; he had not given him any Notice of the Appointment, which the Prince and he had made to &s;up at his Hou&s;e, nor had he any de&s;ign him&s;elf, to entertain him at din|ner in the &s;ame Hou&s;e; &s;o that there were as ma|ny Lies as Words, in all that he had &s;aid to him upon that Head. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> made a Je&s;t
<PB N="111" REF="112">
of all this, with his Friends, without troubling him|&s;elf any more about it. There was one Mr. <HI>Cha|pelle,</HI> who had been formerly one of the Prince's Dome&s;ticks, but at this time a Farmer of the Re|venues, hearing one &s;peak of it to Mr. <HI>Caumartin;</HI> went to his old Ma&s;ter and told him, that though he was far below the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI>'s Quality, yet he &s;hould acquit him&s;elf better of his Promi&s;e than he had done, in giving him an Entertainment at that very Hou&s;e, provided the Prince would not take it ami&s;s, that he had pre&s;umed to invite him to it. The Prince an&s;wered, that he was well &s;a|tisfied with it, and made a new Appointment with his Friends, to be there to morrow in the Evening, and Mr. <HI>Chapelle</HI> regaled him &s;plendidly. There were at this Entertainment many Per&s;ons of Quality, both of Civil and Military Employments; and among the re&s;t there were pre&s;ent tho&s;e, whom the Prince had invited, when he was to have &s;upped there upon the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI>'s Invitation. They di&s;cour&s;ed about a great many things; and as it was impo&s;&s;ible they could forget the Duke, &s;o they took occa&s;ion to &s;peak of a Vi&s;it, that his Mi&s;tre&s;s had lately paid to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris;</HI> becau&s;e he had made an Ordinance, wherein this Lady found her&s;elf con|cerned. There were many Per&s;ons who had taken advantage of his Predece&s;&s;ors ea&s;ie Temper, and had obtained leave of him to have Chappels in their own Hou&s;es; and under pretence of hearing Ma&s;s in the&s;e private Chappels, they came &s;o &s;eldom to Church, that they &s;carcely heard Ma&s;s there, at the Four great Fe&s;tivals of the Year. Now the Archbi&s;hop thought it nece&s;&s;ary to remedy this Cu&s;tom, and for that end he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e Licen&s;es, that his Predece&s;&s;ors had granted; and ordained, that all tho&s;e who de&s;ired to have the Benefit of them for the time to come, &s;hould appear before him, that he might examine the rea&s;ons upon which the Licen&s;es had been granted. The Dukes Mi&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="112" REF="113">
had got one of the&s;e Licences, and &s;he paid a vi&s;it to the Archbi&s;hop, and intreated him to confirm what his predece&s;sor had done. But this Prelat, having heard of her Lewdne&s;s and Licentious way of Living, which was &s;o publick, that even her &s;on had made no &s;cruple &s;ometime before to &s;ay to the King, when he asked him, if he would be ready in a &s;hort time, to go to the Army; that he could not be &s;o &s;oon in a readine&s;s to go thither, becau&s;e his Mother had been more concerned to get ready the Duke <HI>d'Elbeufs</HI> Equipage, than his. This Prelat I &s;ay, who knew all this, and a Thou&s;and other ill things of her; an|&s;wered her coldly, that tho&s;e who would wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hip God acceptably, mu&s;t fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t know him, and fear him, and that tho&s;e who did know him and fear him, would always think their pains well be&s;towed, when they went to Church where the re&s;t of his &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rvants u&s;e to &s;erve and wor&s;hip him; and without &s;aving any more to her, he refu&s;ed to Grant her reque&s;ts. The Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> and all the Company Commen|ded the Archbi&s;hop, for having &s;poken to her after this manner, for tho it was but a word or two that he had &s;aid; yet it was Enough, to make her reflect of her own ill Conduct. The mo&s;t part of them &s;aid al&s;o, that the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI> was much in the wrong, to deal &s;o unkindly as he did, by his own Lady, for the &s;ake of an old antiquated Whore, who had the Impudence &s;ometimes to boa&s;t of the finene&s;s of her Complexion, when it was well enough known, that it was Entirely owing to painting; But there were &s;ome, who undertook to ju&s;tify the Duke, though they could not ju&s;tify this Lady his Mi&s;tre&s;s. They pleaded in his behalf, that &s;ince he had nothing to Live by, or to &s;upport his Character, except his Go|vernment, he could not be much blamed, for ha|ving a Kindne&s;s for a Lady, that rewarded him &s;o Liberally as &s;he did; That &s;he was frequently giving him good &s;ums, and therefore he di&s;pen&s;ed with her age. That there were &s;everal others who would do the
<PB N="113" REF="114">
&s;ame thing, if they were in his circum&s;tances: and in a word it was an ordinary thing among the young Beaus of the Court.</P>
<P>This was not the only Lady whom they had put on the foot of paying them well. In the mean time, it had been always the fate of King <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d. who had been mightily in love with this Lady, to have Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es who fought only to enrich them|&s;elves at his expence, and with his &s;poils to enrich others before his face. Another Dutche&s;s, whom this Prince had Lov'd, before this, had u&s;ed him the very &s;ame way as this did, and the <HI>Chevalier de Cha|lillon,</HI> who is known at pre&s;ent in the world, under the name of Marquis, had continued to render her good &s;ervice as long as &s;he had wherewithal to re|compence him; and &s;he thought &s;he employ'd her Money very well, becau&s;e he was hand&s;ome and very well &s;hap'd, and be&s;ides, he was al|ways ready when &s;he had a Mind for him. For &s;he was a woman that gave no quarter to her Lovers, and pay'd them only in proportion to their &s;ervices. She had learn'd from a Lady that was her friend, and who had Learned it her&s;elf from an old <HI>Counte&s;s de Vertus,</HI> that things ought to be done in this manner, and at lea&s;t that this was the practi&s;e of the old Counte&s;s her &s;elf, who pa&s;&s;ed among&s;t the women of her time for the Cunninge&s;t that was among them all. The world indeed had accus'd her of weakne&s;s of judgment, but they had done her the greate&s;t in|ju&s;tice that can be done to a Woman; &s;ince &s;o far from being a Fool as was Pretended, &s;he had made it appear by one of the Principal Actions of her Life, that never any Lady had better under&s;tanding: for being grown old, and yet the prick of the fle&s;h continuing to torment her, &s;he took the Method that any hone&s;t Woman ought to take, which was, to find out a Husband for her&s;elf, tho &s;he was quite decrepid. In the mean time, knowing by the ex|perience that &s;he had of the world, that &s;he might come to be deceiv'd, unle&s;s &s;he took all the precauti|on
<PB N="114" REF="115">
that prudence could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ugge&s;t, &s;he did two things which &s;hew the greatne&s;s of her Judgment. One was, to ca&s;t her Eyes on a Man who&s;e figure promi&s;ed fairly; The other was, to make a bar|gain with him, to oblige him to his good behaviour. This Man was the <HI>Chevalier de la Porte,</HI> who after the &s;ame manner as the <HI>Chevalier de Ch&acirc;tillon</HI> is now from <HI>Chevalier</HI> come to be a <HI>Comte.</HI> He was of a good Family, and tho he was not come of the Dukes of <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tagne,</HI> as her fir&s;t Husband was, yet &s;he could put him in his place, without being accus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d of making a mean Alliance. So being &s;atisfy'd both of his Per&s;on and of his Birth, the Que&s;tion was only how to &s;e|cure her&s;elf again&s;t the di&s;gu&s;ts, which a Husband u&s;u|ally takes, e&s;pecially when intere&s;t has oblig'd him to take the burthen of an old Carca&s;s, which he never marries but in the view and hope of being quickly rid of it. A Woman of &s;o much knowledg and Experience was not ea&s;ily to be deceiv'd, and behold too, what Mea&s;ures &s;he took to avoid it. Af|ter &s;he had expre&s;s'd the tender Sentiments &s;he had for him, by which he reckon'd him&s;elf extremely Honored, becau&s;e he had nothing, and &s;he was very Rich, then &s;he &s;hewed him a &s;trong box, in which there was Fifty Thou&s;and Crowns of ready Money. Having opened it too, that he might be the more fully a&s;&s;ured of what was in it, and having let him look on it as long as was enough to make him in love with it, &s;he told him, that here was, what &s;he in|tended to give him, on Condition that when he was her Husband he &s;hould u&s;e her kindly. The <HI>Cheva|lier de la Porte,</HI> who knew as well as any Man alive, how to make Promi&s;es; &s;wore to her, Mountains and wonders, to per&s;wade her, that if ever &s;he did him that favour, he had rather dye a Thou&s;and Deaths, than ever to be guilty of Ingratitude. It &s;eems he thought &s;he would tru&s;t to his Swearing. But the Counte&s;s retaining &s;till her former &s;enti|ments, told him, that tho' &s;he believed him a Man
<PB N="115" REF="116">
of Honour and in that Quality that he would keep his word to her, neverthele&s;s that &s;he would take &s;uch Precautions with him, that &s;he &s;hould have no rea&s;on ever to repent of; that a Husband very often laught at the Promi&s;es which he made to his Wife; that &s;he had no Mind to be di&s;appointed, and therefore had re&s;olved to tell him once for all, that if he would have her 50 Thou&s;and Crowns, he mu&s;t merit them by u&s;ing her obligingly; that the be&s;t thing a Husband can do to a Wife is to care&s;s her frequently; that on her part &s;he promi&s;ed to give him ten <HI>Louis d'ors</HI> for every time he care&s;&s;ed her, and as often and as far as he erred his performances, he might reckon to be payed accordingly. At this rate, if he care&s;&s;ed her but three times a Night, there was thirty <HI>Louis d'ors</HI> &s;ure for him in the Morning, but if he pu&s;hed his valor further, he might quickly make the &s;trong Box pa&s;s from her Clo&s;et into his own. This clau&s;e and Condition was not very agreeable to the <HI>Che|valier,</HI> tho on other occa&s;ions he had been often at work, without being &s;o well Rewarded. But hav|ing a Pa&s;&s;ion for this Money, he con&s;ented to gain it with the &s;weat of his Brow. The Lady married him privately, and keeping her word to him every Morning in Proportion to his &s;ervices, he had quick|ly emptied the &s;trong box, if the Lady's Children had not perceived the intrigue betwixt them. They &s;poke to her of it, as a thing that made the world talk &s;trangely of her conduct, and the Lady, finding her&s;elf &s;traitned in this point, told them at la&s;t, that they were unju&s;t to &s;u&s;pect her of Lewdne&s;s, that &s;he did nothing but what was Lawful for her to do, that &s;he was Married to the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> and that &s;he would lye with him as often as ever &s;he plea|&s;ed. Her Children knowing that &s;he had ready Money, and that this was the high way to &s;quander it, endeavoured to get the Marrige annulled, on pretext, that her great Age, for &s;he was at lea&s;t Se|venty and two, had made her Incapable to know what &s;he was doing. The Affair being brought
<PB N="116" REF="117">
before the Judges, the Advocates pleaded on both &s;ides; the&s;e for the Children, alledged &s;trongly what they had been told, that the Lady was moap'd and &s;illy, and that the <HI>Chevalier</HI> had &s;urpriz'd and im|pos'd on her Weakne&s;s; but the Advocates on the other &s;ide, having utterly run down this Pretext, by producing the Bargain which &s;he had made with the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> and which &s;he had given him fairly in Writing; the Children had certainly lo&s;t their Cau&s;e, but the Judges would not &s;uffer the <HI>Chevalier,</HI> who&s;e De&s;ire to empty the &s;trong Box, had brought him almo&s;t on his la&s;t Legs already, to go on to kill him&s;elf.</P>
<P>They con&s;idered likewi&s;e, that the Lady by this means, would ruin her Children; for if this Coffer were once emptied, &s;he would &s;ell all that &s;he had, rather than fail to fill it again, in order to enter|tain the good Services, which the <HI>Chevalier</HI> had not fail'd to perform very con&s;tantly. So the Mar|riage was annull'd by Decree of Parliament, who neverthele&s;s appointed the <HI>Chevalier</HI> to have 20000 Crowns, for the Reward of his Labour.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>England</HI>'s Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es us'd him much after the &s;ame manner, and made him pay as dear for his Plea&s;ures, as this old Lady paid to the <HI>Chevalier;</HI> e&s;pecially &s;he to whom this little Hi&s;tory was told, and whom the <HI>Marquis de Ch&acirc;tillon</HI> did &s;o drain of her Acqui&s;itions, that &s;he is now as poor and mi&s;erable as once &s;he was opulent. As for the other, whom the Duke <HI>d'Elbeuf</HI> frequented, &s;he managed it a little better, though in the mean time &s;he &s;tuck at no Expen&s;e or Reward, when he threat|ned to leave her, and go and pu&s;h his Fortune el&s;e|where.</P>
<P>But, let us now pa&s;s to &s;ome other Subject: We mu&s;t know then, that &s;he who was Lady of Honour to <HI>Madam la Dutche&s;&s;e,</HI> being re&s;olved to retire from Court, her Place which is worth 2000 Crowns of Pen&s;ion <HI>per Ann.</HI> was &s;ought for, by a great many
<PB N="117" REF="118">
Ladies of Quality; who be&s;ides the 2000 Crowns which they had in their View, con&s;idered al&s;o, that thereby they &s;hould have Opportunities to get into His Maje&s;ty's Favour; for he de&s;ires to have one al|ways about <HI>Madam la Dutche&s;&s;e,</HI> who will give him an exact Account of all that &s;he does: And it is of for that rea&s;on, that he has appointed the&s;e &s;orts of Ladies of Honour, both for her and the other Prince&s;&s;es of the Blood; and that he him&s;elf has &s;ettled pen&s;ions upon them. And he has a politick de&s;ign in it, for thereby he keeps both them and their Husbands in their Duty, becau&s;e they know, that they have one in their Hou&s;e, who takes notice of every thing they do; &s;o that they dare not adventure upon any thing that may in the lea&s;t di&s;plea&s;e the King. The Marchione&s;s <HI>de la Porte,</HI> who&s;e Husband was once Admiral of a Squadron, and Nephew of the <HI>Comte de la Porte,</HI> whom I &s;poke of ju&s;t now, having but a &s;mall E&s;tate to live by, thought, that it would be very convenient for her, to have that Po&s;t, e&s;pecially &s;he having been a Wi|dow for &s;everal Years. She had &s;everal Friends, and among others, the Marquis <HI>d' Angeau,</HI> who has &s;ome Intere&s;t at Court, and did his utmo&s;t to have carried the Place for her. He was once in a fair way to have &s;ucceeded in it, but that it was told the King, that this Lady was not of &s;ufficient Quality for &s;o honourable an Employment; yet no body ad|ventured to &s;peak any thing again&s;t her Conduct, for though &s;he be no great Beauty, yet &s;he is of &s;o great Virtue, that &s;he's as much e&s;teemed, as tho&s;e who are much more beautiful: And the late <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Croi&s;&s;y,</HI> was once afraid, that his Son, who is now Secretary of State, &s;hould be &s;o taken with this Lady's true Merit, as to make a &s;ecret Marriage with her; and therefore he &s;ent him into <HI>Italy,</HI> where he made him &s;tay &s;ome Years, and did not recal him, till he thought it probable, that his long Ab&s;ence had cured him of the Wounds, which his Conver&s;e with her had given him.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="119">
But her Enemies made u&s;e of another Argument again&s;t her; to which, had &s;he got but a fair hear|ing, &s;he could have &s;o &s;atisfied the King, that no doubt &s;he would have obtained her De&s;ire. But they impo&s;ed upon His Maje&s;ty, and told him, that there were Two Families of <HI>la Porte</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> that the one of them was a good Family, and the other was naught, that &s;he was of the la&s;t, and <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Mazarine</HI> was of the fir&s;t, and if he &s;hould pre|fer her to be Lady of Honour to <HI>Madame la Dutch|e&s;&s;e,</HI> People of the lowe&s;t Rank might pretend to Advancement, as well as &s;he. And by this means, they prevailed &s;o far, as that &s;he was excluded, and the Marchione&s;s <HI>de l' Angle,</HI> was preferred to that Place. Though in the mean time, &s;he could have ju&s;tly pleaded, that her Husband was of as good a Family as the Marquis <HI>de la Porte,</HI> for the <HI>Marquis</HI> was of <HI>la Porte de Ve&s;ins,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Mazarin</HI> was of another <HI>la Porte.</HI> At lea&s;t this was &s;aid when the Mare&s;hal <HI>de la Milleray,</HI> who was the Marquis's Father, had made his Fortune under the Mini&s;try of Cardinal <HI>Richelien,</HI> with whom he was fir&s;t Cou&s;ins. It is true, there were &s;ome who then alledged, that his Father the Advocate <HI>la Porte,</HI> was not de&s;cended of the Family <HI>de la Porte de Ve&s;&s;ins,</HI> though he pretended to be of it; and the Mar|quis <HI>de Ve&s;ins</HI> was not well plea&s;ed with his Pre|tences, in&s;omuch, that he would have challenged him for taking the Coat of Arms, that belongs to his Family, but that he was &s;o afraid of the Car|dinal's Greatne&s;s, that he &s;poke nothing of it, unle&s;s it was to &s;ome particular Friends, to whom he would &s;ometimes &s;ay, by way of Je&s;t, that tho&s;e who ad|vi&s;ed him to enter into a Law-&s;uit, with the Mare|&s;hal upon that account, gave him bad Coun&s;el; that he did not &s;ee how it could be pretended, that the Ma|re&s;hal had done him any Di&s;honour, by entring him|&s;elf a De&s;cendant of his Family, that on the contrary, he look'd upon it, as an evidence that the Mare&s;hal con|&s;idered
<PB N="119" REF="120">
his Family, as better than many others, for which he was much obliged to him.</P>
<P>This was not the fir&s;t time, the King had been impo&s;ed upon, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions. The late Mar|quis <HI>de Renel,</HI> had &s;ome Enemies at Court, who in|&s;inuated to His Maje&s;ty, that he was but of a very late Family, &s;o, that though he was a Per&s;on of great Merit, yet the King who has great Con&s;iderations for Birth, look'd upon him, as one of tho&s;e, whom he ought not to advance &s;o &s;oon as others; for there are People, of certain Names and Ranks, who have &s;ome Right to hope, that they &s;hall not lan|gui&s;h &s;o long as others do, in the meer Expectation of the Favours, which his Maje&s;ty u&s;es to be&s;tow upon his Subjects. However, this Marquis having a great De&s;ire to be Lieutenant General of the King's Armies, and thinking, that he ought to have been preferred &s;ooner, he took occa&s;ion to &s;peak of it one day to the King, and fairly repre&s;ented to him, what good Services he had done him. The King gave him a favourable Hearing, as he always u&s;es to do to tho&s;e, who addre&s;s to him, though few of them have the Honour to be known to him. But when his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to an&s;wer him, the Marquis was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear him &s;ay, that he was in the wrong to be &s;o impatient, and that he belie|ved, he had done as much for him, as for any Man of his Rank. That every Man ought to do him &s;o much Ju&s;tice, as not to think he was forgotten or neglected; though Per&s;ons of great Quality were preferred to him. That it was true, that Merit ought to be rewarded, wherever it was found, and that he had always had a &s;pecial Regard to it, ever &s;ince he had governed by him&s;elf, but that there were certain Families, which he thought fit to prefer to others, for they had been always in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t honourable Offices, and the highe&s;t Preferments, both at Court, and in the Ar|my; and that he could not without Inju&s;tice, de|prive
<PB N="120" REF="121">
their Children of them, unle&s;s he found that they had degenerated from the Virtue of their An|ce&s;tors. The <HI>Marquis</HI> &s;oon perceived by this Di&s;|cour&s;e, that his Maje&s;ty had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a mean opinion of his Birth: But he was &s;o far from cont adicting what his Maje&s;ty had &s;aid, in favour of tho&s;e who had been of honourable Families, that he told him, it was for that very rea&s;on, that he thought him&s;elf neglected, that though he was not a Duke and Peer, or had not &s;o much as any Office of the Crown, yet he was of as good a Family, as the mo&s;t part of tho&s;e, who had been advan|ced to higher Po&s;ts: That his Ance&s;tors had had the Honour to do good Services, to his Maje&s;ty's Royal Ance&s;tors, and that &s;o long as he followed their Example, he did not &s;ee, why he was not capable of any of tho&s;e Offices, that are de&s;igned for Per|&s;ons of the be&s;t Quality. If the <HI>Marquis</HI> was &s;ur|pri&s;ed at His Maje&s;ty's Di&s;cour&s;e, the King was no le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed at his. He had always thought, that the <HI>Marquis</HI> was one of tho&s;e up&s;tart <HI>Mar|qui&s;es,</HI> of whom there are &s;o many at <HI>Paris,</HI> and e&s;pecially of Citizens, who take upon them this Title, though the Foundations of it were laid only in their Fathers Coffers, or in &s;ome Offices of the Gown, which &s;ome of their Family has enjoyed. And being de&s;irous to be fully informed in this mat|ter, he asked him, if it was not true, that had been told him, that he was only <HI>de la Noble&s;&s;e Bourgeoi&s;e, i. e.</HI> one who derived his Pedigree, only from rich Citizens, or from tho&s;e who had enjoyed Offices of the Long Robe, as was &s;aid of the late Arch|bi&s;hop o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Paris.</HI> When I &s;peak after this manner, it is in Imitation of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Noyon.</HI> For that Prel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">te, who is the Glory of Prelates, yet not in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> in which he ought to be it&punc; but only, be|ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e he thinks, that no Man is comparable to him, for the Quality of his Ance&s;tors: and &s;peaking one day of the Family of that Archbi&s;hop, he &s;aid, that it

could not be called an Honourable Family, but only one of the be&s;t of tho&s;e Families, that have been rai|&s;ed by Lawyers, or that had made a Figure among the Citizens of <HI>Paris.</HI> What he &s;aid was true upon the matter, for there is a great difference between a Family that is truly honourable, and &s;uch a Fami|ly as he was &s;peaking of; but &s;ometimes, all the Truth &s;hould not be told, e&s;pecially if there is a great man who may take it ami&s;s: for &s;ome days after the Chief Pre&s;ident of the Parliament, who is de&s;cended of the &s;ame Family, that the late Archbi&s;hop was of, made the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Noyon</HI> &s;en&s;ible of his Folly. The Bi&s;hop being come to dine with him, and his Coach|man having carried home his Coach Hor&s;es, re&s;ol|ving to return with them in the Afternoon; the Chief Pre&s;ident, who had been informed of what he had &s;aid of his Family, and who is &s;eldom upon the Re|&s;erve with any man, e&s;pecially, if he have any Quar|rel again&s;t him, no &s;ooner &s;aw him, but he gave or|ders to the Steward of his Hou&s;e, not to &s;erve up din|ner, till he was gone. The Bi&s;hop &s;taid till the or|dinary time of Dinner was pa&s;t, and long'd for it, but &s;eeing no appearance of it, he asked the Pre&s;ident if that was one of his Fa&s;ting Days, he told him plain|ly, that it was not, but that he had given Orders, that no Dinner &s;hould be &s;erved up, till he was gone, becau&s;e it would be too great Pre&s;umption in him, and a Token that he had forgotten the meanne&s;s of his Birth, which was but of the <HI>Noble&s;&s;e Burgeoi&s;e,</HI> if he &s;hould offer to entertain at his Table, &s;o great a <HI>Seig|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r,</HI> and one of &s;uch an illu&s;trious De&s;cent, as he was of; to this he added &s;ome other Words to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; and the Bi&s;hop was puzzled what to &s;ay to him; but after &s;ome dull Apologies, he was for|ced to go home and dine at his own Hou&s;e; yet he would fain have &s;taid dinner with the Pre&s;ident, be|cau&s;e his Coach Hor&s;es were not there; but the Pre|&s;ident cho&s;e to let him have the u&s;e of his Coach, ra|ther than he &s;hould have &s;taid dinner at his Hou&s;e.

But to return to the Marquis <HI>de Renel,</HI> he &s;aid to the King, that he knew no &s;uch thing in his Family, as <HI>la Noble&s;&s;e Burgeoi&s;e;</HI> that every one of his An|ce&s;tors, wore a Sword by his Side, and if there were any of the Family that had not done it, it was be|cau&s;e he was con&s;ecrated to the Church, as was the Cardinal <HI>d' Amboi&s;e,</HI> who had the Honour, to be the fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of the Crown. When he &s;poke of this Cardinal, the King perceived, that he had been impo&s;ed upon, by tho&s;e who had made him believe, that the Marquis was but of a late Family, and of mean Extract. So that, afterwards he did him Ju&s;tice, and gave him what he had asked.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Choi&s;eul,</HI> who had di&s;corded with his Lady, was reconciled to her, after his Return from <HI>Savoy.</HI> She could hardly be prevailed with to live with her Husband, and though &s;he was fully as much to blame, as he was, for the Breach that was betwixt them; yet &s;he pretended, that it was not &s;afe for her to live with him. But the King told her, that &s;he had but one of two Things to chu&s;e, either to cohabit with her Husband, or to go into a Nunnery. The very Thoughts of a Nun|nery, is enough to fright a Lady, e&s;pecially, when &s;he has any Inclinations to be a <HI>Coquette,</HI> &s;o that the very &s;peaking of it, was enough to oblige her, to obey his Maje&s;ty's Commands. But the King's Care extended farther than to tho&s;e Ladies, who did not live as they ought to do with their Husbands, he took care al&s;o, to curb the Extravagancies of many others, even though they did not belong to the Court, and being informed, that <HI>Mon&s;ieur l' Ab|bee Lionne,</HI> the Son of the late <HI>Mon&s;ieur Lionne,</HI> Mini&s;ter and Secretary of State, and who enjoyed the Abbacy of <HI>Marmoutier,</HI> with a great many o|ther rich Benefices, did not behave him&s;elf &s;o well, as his Character obliged him to do, he &s;ent him a Letter <HI>de Cachett,</HI> ordering him to retire into a Seminary. He al&s;o appointed one to &s;tay with
<PB N="123" REF="124">
him, and to take care, that when any Benefices, that were at his Gift, became vacant, he &s;hould neither dimini&s;h the Revenues of them, nor be|&s;tow them upon unworthy Per&s;ons. <HI>Mon&s;ieur l' Abbee Roullier,</HI> who&s;e Father had made &s;o great an E&s;tate by the Po&s;t Office, that he &s;ettled all his Children, as if they had been Per&s;ons of &s;ome Quality, was al&s;o &s;ent to the Seminary of <HI>Notre Dame de Vertus,</HI> with an Order to tho&s;e that had the In&s;pection of him, that they &s;hould not allow him to corre&s;pond with any Per&s;on, and that they &s;hou'd oblige him to do Pennance; for all this was nece&s;&s;ary, to reduce him to a right &s;en&s;e of his Duty, &s;eeing he had become a Rake, and led &s;uch a profligate Life, that he equally di&s;graced the Character of an <HI>Abbee,</HI> with which he had been honoured, and that of a Magi&s;trate, with which he was al&s;o cloathed; for he was Coun|&s;ellor Clerk of the Parliament of <HI>Paris:</HI> But he had &s;o little Regard to what became the Dignity of tho&s;e two Places, that there was not a grea|ter <HI>Debauche</HI> in all the City. But notwith|&s;tanding all the Care his Maje&s;ty took, to repre&s;s Immoralities, and to oblige all Per&s;ons, to live &s;uitably to their Characters; yet the Genera|lity of them, were &s;o far from an&s;wering that De&s;ign, that there were greater Abu&s;es committed than ever. For where there was one, that was thereby prevai|led upon, to abandon his former vices, there were Thou&s;ands, who thought it enough, if they were &s;o far Hypocrites, as to plea&s;e his Maje&s;ty by an out|ward Appearance: &s;o that Hypocri&s;ie began then to come in fa&s;hion, and there were never &s;o many <HI>Tar|tuffes,</HI> or Hypocritical Puritans, as began to appear at that time, among People of all Ranks, e&s;pecially, among the Courtiers, though one would think, that &s;uch a Character, did le&s;s become them than any o|thers. For it &s;eems to be peculiar to the Court, that though Di&s;&s;imulation may be Learned there, better
<PB N="124" REF="125">
than in any other Place, yet it is a diffimulation of a quite other kind, than what I am now &s;peaking of. For when a Courtier di&s;&s;embles, he does it, that he may procure to him&s;elf as many Plea&s;ures and Con|veniences, as he can, and to &s;hun Troubles and In|conveniences, and not to be his own Tormentor and Executioner, as the Hypocrites; who makes him&s;elf mi&s;erable in this world as well as the next, &s;o that it is an ordinary &s;aying, that an <HI>Hypocrite is tho De|vils Martyr.</HI> Tho&s;e who had new Opinions to Pub|li&s;h, could not have found a time more Convenient for their Purpo&s;e, than this was. There was a cer|tain &s;ect which had lain hid under the A&s;hes, ever &s;ince <HI>Molinos</HI> had Adventured to broach his wild &s;en|timents at <HI>Rome,</HI> and it began now to appear again at <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI> The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> who was <HI>Preceptor</HI> to the young Princes of <HI>France,</HI> and had the reputation of a very devout Man, declared him|&s;elf zealous for this Sect: Tho&s;e who were of it did teach by a &s;ubtil kind of rea&s;oning, tho' to &s;peak the truth they did not avow it plainly, that the Body might do all &s;orts of wickedne&s;s while in the mean time, the Soul might be altogether Innocent and unconcerned, as to what the Body did, for if the Intention of the Soul was directed to God and for his Glory, then it was not in the lea&s;t to be blamed for the ill that the Body did, which is under a &s;trange captivity to the cor|ruption that is in mans nature. There was one <HI>Ma|dame Guyon,</HI> a Lady of no great Quality, but of &s;o great an E&s;tate, that &s;he had Married her Daughter to the <HI>Comte de Vaul,</HI> Elde&s;t Son of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Fouquet,</HI> who had already endeavoured to Propagate this abo|minable Doctrin, for which rea&s;on &s;he had been &s;ent to <HI>Vincennes.</HI> But the Archbi&s;hop, of <HI>Cambray</HI> un|dertaking to defend her Publickly, he Publi&s;hed a Book, in which by an ab&s;tract way of Rea&s;oning, which no Body was capable to comprehend, he en|deavoured to &s;how, that this Doctrine was not in the lea&s;t erroneous. He alledged the Writings of <HI>St.</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="126">
<HI>Francis de Sales</HI> to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf, and pretended, that he taught nothing, but what had been formerly taught by that Holy Man. Every Body was a&s;to|ni&s;hed at the &s;ight of this Book, and it had never been Printed, if the Author had been obliged to ask a licence for it. But the Bi&s;hops have a Privilege to Publi&s;h what Books they Plea&s;e, though their works be not Examined, by tho&s;e who are Authori&s;ed to give Licen&s;es for Printing Books: And this piece was publi&s;hed, before it was known, that he had begun to write it. All the Hypocrites were over|joyed, that a way was found out, for them to gratifie their &s;en&s;ual appetites, while they outward|ly appeared vertuous, which they thought them|&s;elves obliged to do, le&s;t they &s;hould lo&s;e the Kings Favour. But they were not &s;uffered long to boa&s;t of this Imaginary victory: For as &s;oon as this Book appeared, the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> The Bi&s;hops of <HI>Meaux</HI> and <HI>Chartres,</HI> with many other Prelats de|clared again&s;t it; and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> began im|mediately to write a refutation of it; and be&s;ides, he joyned with the Archbi&s;hop of Paris and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chartres</HI> (both which had a great Intere&s;t at Court) to deal earne&s;tly with his Maje&s;ty, that the young Princes, the <HI>Dauphins</HI> Sons, might not be kept any longer, under the Direction of a Prelat, whom they accu&s;ed of the mo&s;t horrible Impieties, that had ever appeared in the Church.</P>
<P>The King knew not well what to &s;ay to this, becau&s;e he had always looked upon the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cam|bray,</HI> as a Man of good Morals, and of Exempla|ry Piety. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that there was never any Prelat appeared more zealous for Gods Glory; for he was &s;o far from having ever given any bad Example, that on the Contrary, he had been very u&s;eful for the Edification of tho&s;e, who &s;aw him or conver&s;ed with him. However, the Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> and tho&s;e other two Bi&s;hops, gave his Maje&s;ty no re&s;t, till they had obtained what they
<PB N="126" REF="127">
de&s;ired, and what they thought nece&s;&s;ary to be done upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and they prevailed with him at la&s;t, to order the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> to re|tire to his own Palace, till fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ther orders. But before he came there, he had occa&s;ion to Practi&s;e the Do|ctrin which he had undertaken to defend; it is com|monly called Quieti&s;m, the meaning of which is, that a Man ought never to be troubled at any thing, that can happen to him: Now the Archbi&s;hops Palace had taken fire, by the fault of &s;ome Servants whom he kept there, and it had con&s;umed not only all the Buildings, but al&s;o all the Furniture of the Hou&s;e, which had been very richly Furni&s;hed. Every Body de&s;ired to know, how he would take this accident, but he appeared &s;till as firm and unconcerned, as if he had been altogether di&s;-interre&s;ted, Mean while, many Per&s;ons of Quality were &s;u&s;pected of the &s;ame Errors, that were charged upon him, and among o|thers, the Duke <HI>de B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">villiers</HI> and his Brother in Law the Duke <HI>de Chevreu&s;e.</HI> The fir&s;t was Gover|nour to the young Princes of <HI>France,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Preceptor</HI> the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray</HI> had been; and the thoughts of this were unea&s;ie to the King, till he was &s;atisfyed in it by the Duke him&s;elf; the King di&s;cour&s;ed with him a long time in his Clo&s;et upon this Subject, upon which he had likewi&s;e a long conference with the Duke <HI>de Chevreu&s;e;</HI> after which it appeared, that his Maie&s;ty was undeceived, both as to the one and the other; yet their Ladies, who had al|ways been of the Number of tho&s;e, who went to <HI>Marli,</HI> did not go there to often as they had u&s;ed to do before that time, which made &s;ome People believe, that the King Di&s;&s;embled a little in his Carriage to them. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray</HI> wrote in his own Vindication, and pretended, that all that he had &s;aid in that Book, was true and orthodox, and offe|red to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> while the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> accu&s;ed him of Here&s;ie more than ever. The <HI>Abbee de la Trape,</HI> who had
<PB N="127" REF="128">
&s;ome years before, Renounced the Quality of an <HI>Abbee</HI> that he might compleat his Penance, which he had been long under, in the Quality of a &s;imple Monk, Declared him&s;elf al&s;o Mr <HI>de Cambrays</HI> Enemy, without waiting till his Holine&s;s &s;hould Pronounce any thing concerning his Book, tho this Archbi&s;hop had &s;ent it to <HI>Rome,</HI> that he might know his thoughts of it. The <HI>Abbee</HI> wrote two Let|ters upon this Subject, which the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> cau&s;ed to be Publi&s;hed, in the beginning of his own Book; he thought by this to &s;trengthen his cau&s;e, and that &s;ince he had to do with an Archbi&s;hop, who was a Man of Learning and had many Friends, he ought not to neglect any thing, that could in the lea&s;t &s;upport him in it. He al&s;o &s;ent his Nephew <HI>Mon&s;ieur l' Abbee Bo&s;&s;uet</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> that he might there employ all his Intere&s;t to have the Archbi&s;hop condemned; at which, many good People were of|fended, for they thought, that when a Man acted only through Zeal, it was not fit to create him &s;o much trouble. <HI>Madame Guyon,</HI> who by the Intere&s;t her Friends had made for her, was &s;et at Liberty, fell into another Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Fit, in favour of this Sect. &s;he propagated it every where, and infected the Hou&s;e of St. <HI>Cir</HI> with it, &s;o that it was found nece&s;&s;ary, to put &s;ome of the Nuns of that Hou&s;e, into other Con|vents. In a Word, the King took all the Mea&s;ures, that Prudence could &s;ugge&s;t to him, to cru&s;h the&s;e Errors, before they &s;hould do any harm to the Church. While he was at &s;o much pains to pre|vent the ill Con&s;equences of this Debate, there were other debates broke out, in the Churches of <HI>Rheims</HI> and <HI>Roan.</HI> The Archbi&s;hop of this la&s;t City, had made a Li&s;t of &s;ome Books, which he had recom|mended to tho&s;e of his Dioce&s;e, to be made u&s;e of, for re&s;olving ca&s;es of Con&s;cience; but had not mentioned any of tho&s;e Books, which the Je&s;uits think fitte&s;t for that purpo&s;e: the&s;e good Fathers took this &s;o ill, that &s;ome of them appeared in Print again&s;t him: the Arch|bi&s;hop
<PB N="128" REF="129">
accu&s;ed one of their Number as the Author, he pretended to know his Stile, and demanded of the &s;ociety of Je&s;uits, that they would do him Ju&s;tice in puni&s;hing this Author. The Fathers denied that he was the Man, and he denied it him&s;elf; and they &s;ent him to <HI>Paris,</HI> that he might withdraw him&s;elf from the Effects of the Archbi&s;hops anger, who was doing all the mi&s;chief he could again&s;t him, as well as again&s;t all the re&s;t of that Society. He made an exact &s;earch after the Printer of the Pamphlet, that had been Publi&s;hed again&s;t him, and having kept &s;ome of them in Pri&s;on for &s;ome time, the whole bu&s;ine&s;s vani&s;hed into &s;moke for want of evidences. The Schi&s;m that broke out in the Church of <HI>Rheims,</HI> was al&s;o Occa&s;ioned by a debate between the Archbi&s;hop and the Je&s;uits. The&s;e had publickly maintained in the Schools of the Colledge which they have in that City, two things that the Bi&s;hop was not Plea&s;ed with. The fir&s;t was, That the Doctrine which <HI>Moli|na</HI> taught, concerning Grace, had been virtuous in all the attacks, that its Enemies had made again&s;t it The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Rheims,</HI> who is no <HI>Molini&s;t,</HI> cen&s;ured the&s;e <HI>The&s;es,</HI> as full of Fal&s;hoods, and publi&s;hed an Edict, declaring that they did not contain the true Doctrine of the Church: he therein al&s;o cen&s;ured &s;ome other Pa&s;&s;ages, which they had cited in another <HI>The&s;is,</HI> and this Edict being conceived in Terms, that they were very much di&s;&s;atisfied with, they did much the &s;ame, that tho&s;e of <HI>Roan</HI> had done. They wrote again&s;t it, and expo&s;ed it. So that the Archbi&s;hop, to oblige them to do him Ju|&s;tice, was advi&s;ed, to cau&s;e the Provincial and the Three Rectors of their Hou&s;es at <HI>Paris,</HI> to be cited, that they might declare, if this Pamphlet, which had been Printed in that City had been done by their Order, or without their order. The Author had been more circum&s;pect than to put his Name to it,
<PB N="129" REF="130">
and the Book&s;eller and Printer had concealed their Names: But the Author had &s;aid enough, to let the World know, that he had compo&s;ed it, by Or|der of his Superiours; and it was upon that ac|count, that the Archbi&s;hop would oblige the Pro|vincial and the Three Rectors, to make their De|claration. After they had met in a Chapter, up|on this Bu&s;ine&s;s, they were &s;o fooli&s;h, as to de|clare, that the Pamphlet contained nothing, but what was con&s;onant to Truth; and what they were ready to defend, So that having made this Confe&s;&s;ion, the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Rheims,</HI> gave in his Addre&s;s to the Parliament, de&s;iring, that Judgment might pa&s;s again&s;t them, and that they might be obliged to make a publick Reparation of the Injury they had done him, in publi&s;hing &s;o &s;candalous things again&s;t him. In this Addre&s;s he &s;aid, that if they preten|ded, as it &s;eem'd they did, that they had been inju|red by his Edict; then the Laws and Cu&s;toms of the Church taught them, that there were but Two ways, by which they could have Redre&s;s. The one was, to have made it known to him&s;elf, by repre|&s;enting to him, wherein he had injured them: But if they thought, that he would be too partial in his own Cau&s;e, and would not retract what he had once done, how unju&s;t &s;oever it might be to them; then the other way was, to have addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to the Primate. He repre&s;ents al&s;o, that it was not becoming private Men, to expo&s;e the Conduct of an Archbi&s;hop, by &s;editious Pamphlets. That &s;uch a thing might be of dangerous Con&s;equence, be&s;ides, that it was a Breach of Charity. The thing which had given occa&s;ion to all this, was capable to have revived the great Di&s;pute concerning Grace, which had made &s;o much noi&s;e in the beginning of this Age, and therefore the King thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to put a &s;top to this Law-Suit, and told Fa|ther <HI>de la Chai&s;e,</HI> that it was his Royal Plea&s;ure, that the Society of Je&s;uites, &s;hould give Satisfaction
<PB N="130" REF="131">
to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Rheims;</HI> and having called the Chief Pre&s;ident of the Parliament to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> that he might give him &s;uch Orders, as he judged ne|ce&s;&s;ary about this Affair. He took up I know not how much time, in di&s;cour&s;ing with him of the be&s;t Methods, for putting an end to it. The Je&s;uites, who had made a fooli&s;h Step, in ju&s;tifying every thing that was in the Pamphlet, were very glad, that the King had fallen upon a way, how they might evite the Shame and Di&s;grace, which would have infallibly come upon them, if the Parliament had proceeded to pronounce a Sentence. They went to the Chief Pre&s;ident, and told him, they were ready to obey the King's Orders; the Pre&s;ident told them, he was glad, they were come to a Re&s;olu|tion, that was &s;o much for their Intere&s;t, as well as rea&s;onable in it &s;elf. He concerted the whole matter with them, that they &s;hould draw up a Writing, by which they &s;hould acknowledge, that they had taken wrong mea&s;ures, in not addre&s;&s;ing to the Archbi&s;hop him&s;elf, as they ought to have done; that he might have been plea&s;ed to have heard them in their own Vindication; and promi|&s;ing that they &s;hould take that method for the fu|ture, if ever they &s;hould be &s;o unfortunate, as to have occa&s;ion to complain of him. And that in this Writing, they &s;hould intreat the Archbi&s;hop to par|don what was pa&s;t, and to receive them and their Society again into his favour. The Pre&s;ident com|municated this Writing to the King, before it was &s;igned, that he might know how his Maje&s;ty was &s;atisfied with it. The Archbi&s;hop could not demand any more, &s;o that he was content to put an end to the Debate, provided they &s;hould &s;ign that Pa|per. Perhaps they would not haye done it, if the King had not interpo&s;ed his Authority, but the good learned Fathers, knew better than others did, that Scripture commands us expre&s;ly to obey &s;upe|riour Powers; and therefore it was no hard matter

to per&s;wade them to do what the Archbi&s;hop had de|manded of them.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time that the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cam|bray</HI>'s Opinions (of which I have already given &s;ome Account) made &s;o much Noi&s;e, the Prince&s;s <HI>d' Har|court,</HI> was obliged to go to <HI>Normandy,</HI> where her Husband's E&s;tate lies, to look after his private Affairs: She had been long at Court, and had always found a way to pre&s;erve her Intere&s;t in it, in all the Changes that fell out; though there were many others that were fully of as good &s;en&s;e as &s;he, who were not able to do &s;o much. So &s;oon as &s;he was gone from it, it was reported, that it was partly upon her account, that the Archbi&s;hop had been ca&s;t out of favour. And many were of opinion, that &s;he was a <HI>Quieti&s;t,</HI> and &s;o much the rather, becau&s;e &s;he retired &s;o often, &s;ometimes into one Convent, &s;ometimes into another. But a Lady, who thought &s;he knew her bet|ter than others did, &s;aid to tho&s;e who were &s;peaking of her, that they were mi&s;taken as to that Prince&s;s, and that &s;he was not for creating trouble to her&s;elf, by an indi&s;creet Zeal; and that &s;he could be Surety for her, that till the King, as well as his Mini&s;ters be|came <HI>Quieti&s;ts,</HI> &s;he &s;hould not be one: But if they &s;hould declare them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">elves once in favour of that Par|ty, &s;he would not then promi&s;e for her; for never Lady was more inclined than &s;he, to perform exactly what was enjoined by St. <HI>Peter, to obey every Ordi|nance of Man, whether the King as &s;upreme, or tho&s;e who are in Authority under him.</HI> Tho&s;e who were concerned in this Lady, and had been under &s;ome fears, that the Reports of her being <HI>Quieti&s;t</HI> might be true, were well &s;atisfied with this Account of her. Soon after, &s;he returned from <HI>Normandy,</HI> and was not behind with any Lady at Court, in exclaiming a|gain&s;t <HI>Quieti&s;m;</HI> and &s;poke upon all occa&s;ions, of no le&s;s than Fire and Faggot, for tho&s;e of that Per|&s;wa&s;ion.</P>

About this time, the Chief Pre&s;ident's Son, was made a Coun&s;ellor of State, in the Place of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Pu&s;&s;ort,</HI> who at la&s;t had paid that Tribute, which all men owe to Nature, after he had been Two or Three Years, without being able to go to the Coun&s;el, of which he was Dean. He was Uncle to the late <HI>Mon|&s;ieur Colbert,</HI> Mini&s;ter and Secretary of State, and he was as his Right-hand to him, when he was con|triving ways and means for enriching the King, at his Subject-Co&s;t. For he had laid down &s;ome Ma|xims of his own, by which he determined always in favour of the Exchequer. And it was never &s;een, that he had been &s;o much as in one &s;ingle In&s;tance, prevailed with, even by the &s;tronge&s;t Arguments, to determine otherwi&s;e. So that in the Council, he got the Name of <HI>Pu&s;&s;ort</HI> the <HI>Fi&s;cal.</HI> And when any man was &s;o unhappy, as to have a Law-&s;uit with the King, he had rea&s;on to give over his Cau&s;e for lo&s;t, if it de|pended upon his Vote. But at la&s;t, when he found him&s;elf at the point of Death, he began to reflect, that he mu&s;t give an account of all the&s;e things; the Thoughts of them, put him under great fears. His Confe&s;&s;or endeavoured to encourage him, by repre|&s;enting to him the Mercies of God, who pardons all the Sins a man has been guilty of, &s;o &s;oon as he comes to repent of them. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Roan,</HI> who was his Grand Nephew, and to whom he had left &s;ome part of his E&s;tate, as he did to all the&s;e, who were within the &s;ame degrees of Kindred to him; nay, and to the Marquis <HI>de Seignelai</HI>'s Children too, tho' they were farther removed than the re&s;t. I &s;ay, the Archbi&s;hop &s;poke much to the &s;ame purpo&s;e to him, that the Confe&s;&s;or had done. But the poor man was &s;till afraid, that he did it only as thinking thereby to comply with his Humour. And he was the more confirmed in this, when he ob&s;erved, that the Arch|bi&s;hop, when he had gone into the Withdrawing|room, to bring the <HI>Viaticum,</HI> chided the Par&s;on of St. <HI>Roche,</HI> that he had not cau&s;ed him to be put in
<PB N="133" REF="134">
his Bed, in&s;tead of exciting him, who was a dying man, to pay that Re&s;pect and Veneration to that God, in who&s;e pre&s;ence he then was. However, in a &s;hort time, he was called to give an account of all his Actions, before God's Tribunal; and his Heirs had 500000 Crowns of E&s;tate, which he left them to divide among them&s;elves. And there was not &s;o much as one of them, had any u&s;e for his Hou&s;e to dwell in; and therefore they &s;old it to <HI>Mon&s;ieur Bertin,</HI> Trea&s;urer of the ca&s;ual Revenues, who is a man of the greate&s;t Curio&s;ity of any in <HI>Paris,</HI> in the matter of Hou&s;hold Furniture. And as tho&s;e at Court entertain the King, with accounts of every thing that falls out, &s;o it was told his Ma|je&s;ty, that Mr. <HI>Bertin</HI> had bought the Hou&s;e, and that when he came to dwell in it, it would look quite another thing, than it did while Mr. <HI>Pu&s;&s;ort</HI> was alive. They told him al&s;o, that he had the fine&s;t Carpets in the World, better than any that were in his Maje&s;ties Palace. The King had the Curio&s;ity to go and &s;ee them, and he ask'd him, how much they had co&s;t him, and where he had bought them. He an&s;wered, that he had paid 200 Crowns for the Piece of them, at the Auction of the Marquis <HI>de Segnelai</HI>'s Furniture. The King &s;aid be|fore all the Court, that that Mini&s;ter had always dealt &s;o by him, &s;o that when any fine thing, was brought from the <HI>Indies,</HI> he gave him the Re|fu&s;e, and took all the be&s;t to him&s;elf. And he added, that he had never known a more vain|glorious man, than that Marquis; or one that was &s;o conceited of his own Per&s;onage, that his Vanity had made him oftimes fail in point of good Breed|ing, and in the Re&s;pect he ow'd him; for without con&s;idering that he was &s;peaking to his King, he would have ask'd him &s;ometimes, if he did not think he was well dre&s;s'd, and if he had not a good Air. Mr. <HI>Bertin</HI> finding that the King had a de&s;ire for the Carpets, intreated his Maje&s;ty to accept of them
<PB N="134" REF="135">
from him; the King took them, but would not have them in a Gift; but cau&s;ed him to be paid the Money that he had given for them. There were Three Ladies who had been Friends of Mr. <HI>Pu&s;&s;ort,</HI> that expected, he would have con&s;idered them in his Will: And for that end, had complied for &s;e|veral Years, with all his Humours; they had e|very Night entertained him with Diver&s;ions &s;uitable to his own Fancy, and he had never given them &s;o much as a Cup of Water for a reward, except Two Meals that he gave them a Year. The one of them was Marchione&s;s <HI>de Merce,</HI> who was his Wife's Niece, and the other Two Per&s;ons, I &s;hall not name; but they had fully as great a De&s;ire to have their &s;hares of his Money, as &s;he had. But they were quite fru&s;trated in their Hopes, as well as &s;he. There were a great many who made In|tere&s;t for his Place of Coun&s;ellor of State, as well as for his other Place of Coun&s;ellor of the Council of the Royal Revenues, by which he had 18000 Li|vers of Sallary: But the King gave this la&s;t to <HI>Mon|&s;ieur de Pommere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and the other to the Chief Pre|&s;ident's Son, as I have already &s;aid. He had been Attorney General before; but becau&s;e he had made no great Figure in that Po&s;t, his Father addre&s;&s;ed to the King, that he would be plea&s;ed to be&s;tow this upon him, and frankly told his Maje&s;ty, that his rea&s;on was, becau&s;e his Son was not &s;ufficiently qualified for being Attorney General; that when he purcha&s;ed that Office for him, he believed that he had been capable of di&s;charging it; but he found, he had been in a mi&s;take, and that therefore he would be glad to have him ea&s;ed of the Honour of that Bur|then, which he was not capable to bear. This was thought an odd &s;ort of a Compliment, from &s;uch a man as the Chief Pre&s;ident of the Parliament: And tho&s;e who heard of it, ask'd one another, if it was nece&s;&s;ary, that a man, that was of the Par|liament, &s;hould be of greater Parts, than he who
<PB N="135" REF="136">
is of the Council, where the nice&s;t Affairs of the Kingdom are treated of. For it could not be &s;aid, that it was the want of Memory, or the Art of &s;peaking in publick, that made him incapable of the Office of Attorney General; for while <HI>Mon|&s;ieur Talon</HI> had been in that Po&s;t, he had &s;hown a way how to &s;upply tho&s;e defects; he had always read his Pleadings, and as it was no &s;hame to i|mitate a man, who as all <HI>France</HI> confe&s;&s;ed, had ac|quitted him&s;elf honourably in that Office, therefore they concluded, that certainly his Father knew of &s;omething el&s;e, that made him incapable of it. However the Father's Merits &s;upplied all the Son's Imperfections; in&s;omuch that the King, not only granted his Reque&s;t, but another favour al&s;o, which he had not ask'd. For he allow'd him to &s;ell the Office of Attorney General to the be&s;t Advantage. Upon which, there were a great many offered for it, who were as incapable of it, as the Pre&s;ident's Son was; and who had much more Money than Merit. They con&s;idered al&s;o, that as the Incapa|city of his Son, had been the Cau&s;e of his being promoted to be a Coun&s;ellor of State; &s;o they might at la&s;t come to &s;ome Promotion for the &s;ame rea&s;on. Among the re&s;t, there was a Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts, who was the Son of another Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts, and he concluded, that this was the on|ly way, how he could rai&s;e him&s;elf, to the greate&s;t Offices of the Council. And therefore he offered Money for it, as others did, and believed, that he ought to have been prefer'd to them, becau&s;e he excell'd them in the Art of pronouncing ill, and &s;tuttering in his Speech; and had lately married a young Girl, which had made him be much con|&s;idered. But the Chief Pre&s;ident, made an ill &s;tep in Politicks; for whereas he ought to have cho&s;en one of the meane&s;t Qualifications, that he might thereby let the World &s;ee, that his Son was not the only Per&s;on, that was incapable of that Em| Employment:

The Man he bargained with was <HI>Mon&s;ieur Joli de Fleuri</HI> who&s;e Father had been Coun|&s;ellor of the Great Chamber. He got Four Hundred Thou&s;and Franks for it, which was more by 50000 Franks, than is u&s;ually given for &s;uch an office. Then People began to &s;ay of this New Attorney General, that it &s;eemed he had no mind to be Rai&s;ed to the Office of a Coun&s;ellor of State, in that way that the Pre&s;idents Son had been Rai&s;ed to it. For &s;o &s;oon as he was In&s;tal'd in his Office, he made it appear, by his Eloquence and his great Capacity, that he was far above the Ordinary &s;ort of Attorneys.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were a doing among the Law|yers, the Duke <HI>de Lau&s;un,</HI> who has been &s;o to&s;&s;ed by Fortune, ever &s;ince he fir&s;t appeared upon the &s;tage of the World, was very diligent in a Law &s;uit he had again&s;t his Ladies family. When he was near Sixty Years of Age, he had Married a Daughter of the Mare&s;hal <HI>de Lorges,</HI> who was not above Sixteen. In which he Play'd the Fool as much as when he put in for the Command of the Army in <HI>Ireland.</HI> For it's Equal|ly ridiculous, for a Man of Sixty to Marry a Girl of Sixteen, and for one that has never had any Com|mand but over his own Dome&s;ticks or Day Lobourers, to Command an Army. Yet as good &s;en&s;e would qualifie him for the one much more than for the o|ther, &s;o he managed his Wife in &s;uch a way, that he never became one of tho&s;e Husbands, who&s;e wives make them to be Pointed at in the &s;treets; he gave her as many fine Cloaths as &s;he Plea&s;ed, and as much Money as was Needful for her diver&s;ions. But it was upon Condition, that &s;he &s;hould not keep Com|pany, but with &s;ome old Dotards, of whom he was not much affraid. For as to the young Sparks a|bout the Court, &s;he was di&s;charged in any terms to &s;ee them, or to admit of any vi&s;its from them; For by his own Experience he knew the Frailty of young Ladies. All the&s;e Precautions were the more ju&s;ti|ficable, becau&s;e if it was in his Power to Secure this
<PB N="137" REF="138">
young Lady for him&s;elf alone, &s;he was well worth all the Pains he would be at in doing it. And he left nothing undone, that was Nece&s;&s;ary for that End. The Governe&s;s, whom he appointed to wait upon her, was well Advanced in years; &s;he had once been with <HI>Madame de Gui&s;e,</HI> and he tru&s;ted much to her Virtue, &s;he was as &s;eldom from her as was po&s;&s;ible for her to be, and it was a rare thing to &s;ee this young Lady without her Guardian. She had great ad|vantages &s;ecured to her by her Marriage Contract, without which the Mare&s;hal <HI>de Lorges</HI> would not have given her in Marriage to him. But the Mare|&s;hal and his Lady had not given him any portion with her, yet <HI>Fremout,</HI> who had amma&s;&s;ed many Milli|ons of Money, by farming the Kings Revenues, which had been his Imployment almo&s;t fifty year, &s;upplied the want of a Portion, for in the Marriage Contract he had Engaged to Leave them a Hundred Thou|&s;and Crowns, after his Death, and when he died &s;ometime after, the Duke <HI>de Lau&s;une</HI> was &s;urpri&s;ed, that his Son <HI>Mr. D'Onneuil</HI> and the Mare&s;halls Lady who was his Daughter, had renounced all Intere&s;t in the E&s;tate, and had brought from <HI>Languedoc,</HI> a Little Girl of Eleven Years of Age, who called her|&s;elf his Relation, and Pleaded &s;he &s;hould be his heir|e&s;s by the benefit of his Inventory. His Widow had al&s;o Renounced, yet before &s;he did it, &s;he had Con|curred with his Children, to put the be&s;t and mo&s;t Valuable things out of the way. Upon this the Duke found him&s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity, either to Content him&s;elf with any Effects that he found &s;till Remaining of the Inheritance, or to Enter into a Law Suit, a|gain&s;t the Widow and her Son. For as to his Father in Law and Mother in Law, he could not ask anything of them; For they had not &s;igned the Grant which his Ladies Grandfather had made, in Pro&s;pect of the Marriage. Be&s;ides that, they adhered to that Grant, which he had made to them&s;elves, when they were Married together, &s;o that he had not any Rea&s;on

Imaginable, to &s;ue them at Law. But he &s;u'd the Mother and the Son, and pretended that they had &s;ecret Conveyed out of the way, the Effects of the E&s;tate, and, that they ought to be Ordered to pay him an Hundred Thou&s;and Crowns, in Ready Money, without putting him to the pairs of &s;eeking for Payment, out of &s;uch Remains of the E&s;tate, as did &s;till appear. But this was not all he Craved of them, For be&s;ides this 100000 Crowns, for which, <HI>Fremon</HI> had payed Intere&s;t &s;o long as he Lived as of a thing that was already acquired, he had pro|mi&s;ed them, a Hundred Thou&s;and Franks, out of the whole E&s;tate; but his Widdow and her Son had ad|ju&s;ted matters &s;o, that all that was Remaining of the E&s;tate, after the Debts were Payed, was but at mo&s;t 100000 Crowns; &s;o that they De&s;igned to have fru|&s;trated the Duke of 100000 Franks, be&s;ides that they would have left him in hazard, of being called to an Account, by the King and his Mini&s;ters, as or|dinarly all tho&s;e are, who Marry the Daughters or Grand Daughters of Farmers of his Maje&s;ties Reve|nues. Unle&s;s the Marriage Portion has been Payed in Ready Money. The Duke <HI>de Lau&s;un</HI> who had no great Skill to Di&s;pute his Ground in <HI>Ireland,</HI> cho&s;e rather to quit it in time, than to Expo&s;e him&s;elf to the dangers that Threatned him; if he had Stayed to Di&s;pute it with Sword in hand; thought, he could better under&s;tand the Debates of the <HI>Pallais;</HI> and tho' he had no more Served an Apprenti&s;hip in this, than he had done, in the war yet he Armed him&s;elf with a &s;trong Re&s;olution to plead to the utmo&s;t; rather than Do, what Mon&s;ieur <HI>d'Onneuil</HI> would have obli|ged him to.

He had gone to pay her a Vi&s;it, and the Marriage was Concluded, within three Days after.

And be|ing very glad to have a Daughter in Law of &s;o good Quality, he had the Satisfaction to hear every bo|dy approve of the choice he had made for his Son. He certainly quite outdid all that the former Mini|&s;ters of State had done, for rai&s;ing their Families, and tho&s;e of whom his Daughter in law was de&s;cen|ded, were far more illu&s;trious, than the Families of the <HI>Souvrees,</HI> or the <HI>Alegres,</HI> or the <HI>Matignons,</HI> with whom <HI>Tellier,</HI> and the <HI>Colberts</HI> had marched, and the Family of <HI>Cru&s;&s;ol</HI> of which the <HI>Marquis de Barbe&s;ieux</HI>'s fir&s;t Lady was a Daughter, was far &s;hort of them, though it was honoured with the Title of Duke and Peer of <HI>France.</HI> Next morning after this marriage,

But the Evening before, &s;he had got a Pre&s;ent of a little Box, with a great many fine Toys in it, and &s;he found in the Bottom of it, a little Box full of Ear rings and Jewels.</P>
<P>Every Body went and paid Vi&s;its to the new mar|ried Couple, and the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Lau&s;un,</HI> having gone to pay her Compliments, &s;he &s;aw her Mothers Lacqueys in the Antichamber, by which &s;he knew, that &s;he was there. And being unwilling to be found in Company with her, lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould o&s;tend her Husband, &s;he went out of the Room, de&s;igning to go home, though &s;he had already cau&s;ed notice to be given, that &s;he was there. This was told to <HI>Ma|dame de Phelypeaux,</HI> and to <HI>Madame de Pontchartrain,</HI> who was then in company with her, and who &s;ent to call back the Dutche&s;s, and went and &s;poke to her, and brought her into a Clo&s;et, and put her in company with her Mother. The Dutche&s;s was once in hopes to have been married to <HI>Mon&s;ieur Phelypeaux</HI> and his Mother <HI>Madame de Pontchartrain</HI> would have been extremely glad, that &s;he had been her Daugh|ter in Law: But the Duke <HI>de Lau&s;un,</HI> making his Addre&s;&s;es to her at the &s;ame time; the Mare&s;hal <HI>de Lorges,</HI> who knew that the Duke was worth 100000 Livers a Year, loved rather to &s;ee his Daughter a Dutche&s;s, than Daughter in Law to a Mi|ni&s;ter of State. This had made &s;ome Mi&s;under&s;tandings for &s;ome time, between <HI>Madame de Pontchartrain,</HI> and the Mare&s;hal's Lady, but they were reconciled by this Marriage, and &s;he was the fir&s;t that told the Dutche&s;s, that &s;he ought to live in a better Corre|&s;pondence than &s;he did with her Mother. The Ma|re&s;hal's Lady told her the &s;ame, and charged her with Ingratitude, &s;ince &s;he knew well enough, how ten|derly &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ad always loved her. The Dutche&s;s told
<PB N="143" REF="144">
her, that if &s;he plea&s;ed, &s;he might ea&s;ily remove the Cau&s;e, which &s;he had to complain of her. That &s;he wi&s;hed for nothing more, than to &s;ee her frequent|ly, and to live in good Terms with her, and that it was very unplea&s;ant to her, to be deprived of that Happine&s;s. But &s;he was obliged to obey her Hus|band, and it was in her Mothers Power, to cau&s;e Ju|&s;tice to be done him, and then all difficulties would be removed, that be&s;ides, if &s;he loved her, as much as &s;he &s;aid &s;he did, &s;he would cau&s;e ready money to to be paid to the Duke and her, that what they got might be exempted from tho&s;e after Enquiries, to which the E&s;tates of Farmers of the Kings Revenues are lyable. The Mare&s;hal's Lady having no Incli|nation to do any &s;uch thing, or perhaps being afraid that the doing it, might di&s;cover all the Effects, which had been conveyed out of the way, that her Mother, Brother and her&s;elf, might be &s;ecured from &s;uch an Enquiry, an&s;wered her, that &s;he demanded what was impo&s;&s;ible for her to grant: That &s;he could not expect more than what &s;he could have out of her Grandfathers E&s;tate, and that to ask more, was a Proof, that &s;he con&s;idered her own Intere&s;t, rather than what was rea&s;onable. The Dutche&s;s replied, that notwith&s;tanding all &s;he &s;aid, yet the Duke her Husband believed, that he did not demand any thing, but what was rea&s;onable, but &s;ince &s;he and her Friends were all of another Opinion, and he was po&s;itive in his Re&s;olutions, it was not likely they would &s;oon agree, that for her&s;elf, &s;he was extremely vexed at it, becau&s;e &s;he found her&s;elf deprived of all that &s;weet Conver&s;e, &s;he might have with her Parents, without any hopes of a Recon|ciliation, becau&s;e &s;he knew her Husband to be of &s;uch an humour, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;&s;uade him from any thing that he had re&s;olved upon.

<PB N="144" REF="145">
gave him of her Mothers Grief, becau&s;e &s;he and they were not good Friends, he was more in|cen&s;ed again&s;t them, than before. And he not only pro&s;ecuted his Law-&s;uit, but petitioned the Coun|cil, that he might be allowed to bring it before other Judges, pretending that he having accu&s;ed <HI>Madame de Fremont</HI> and her Son, for having intermeddled with the E&s;tate of the decea&s;ed, they ought to plead their Cau&s;e before the Court of <HI>Aides,</HI> and not before the <HI>Requetes du Palais,</HI> by which we may perceive, that while he endeavoured to &s;ecure him&s;elf, again&s;t an Enquiry, he endeavoured to expo&s;e his Lady's Grand mother and her Uncle to one. This enraged them more than ever again&s;t him, e&s;pecially becau&s;e it was their Intere&s;t, that the World &s;hould not know, that <HI>Mon&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ur Fremont</HI> was &s;o rich, as he truly was when he died. For it is a Crime for tho&s;e who farm the Revenues, to die &s;o rich, and their Heirs are ordi|narily called to account for it. They had a Thou|&s;and In&s;tances of this in other People, and though they had not had any, yet they had lately had an In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ance that concerned them nearly, and which no doubt, put them under great Apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>One who had been a Deputy or Clerk to Mr. <HI>Fre|mont,</HI> was di&s;&s;atisfied with him, perhaps becau&s;e he had n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t con&s;idered him in his Will, or it may be, becau&s;e he had not made any great Fortune, while he was in his Service. However, he came to <HI>Mon&s;r.

that he might point out the very Place, where it was hid. But when the Intendant had gone thither, and made as exact a Search, as was po&s;&s;ible for him, there was nothing found. The Deputy thought to have excu&s;ed him&s;elf, by &s;aying it had been taken away, &s;ince the time that he had put it there: But as no Man &s;hould think to deal thus by a Mini&s;ter of State; for they would be every day impo&s;ed upon, if tho&s;e who offered to do it, were not puni&s;hed for it: He was &s;ent to Pri&s;on, and no doubt he de&s;erved it, though he had not been guilty of any thing but of de&s;igning to ruin the Family of that Man, by whom he had acquired all the E&s;tate he had; however the Duke <HI>de Lau&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> pretending that if it was not in that place; that <HI>Madame de Fremont</HI> and her Son, had hid her Husband's and his Father's Trea&s;ures; yet as he pleaded before the Council, the Ca&s;e ought to be referred to the Court of <HI>Aides;</HI> and his rea|&s;ons were, that it belonged to that Court, to take Cogni&s;ance of the E&s;tates of Farmers of the King's Revenues, wherein the King him&s;elf was concerned directly or indirectly. That in the Ca&s;e between <HI>Madame Fremont,</HI> Mr. <HI>Onneuil</HI> and him, the King's Intere&s;t was manife&s;tly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oncerned, &s;eeing the Que|&s;tion was, if they had concealed the Effects, that had belonged to a man imployed in the King's Revenues. There was &s;carce any Per&s;on of Note or Intere&s;t, whether at Court, or in the City, but &s;olicited the one or for the other Party: And though the Mare&s;hal <HI>de Lorges</HI> and his Lady, &s;eem|ed not to concern them&s;elves in the Bu&s;ine&s;s, in which it was thought, that if they would declare them&s;elves, it would be in favour of their Son in law and their Daughter, rather than for <HI>Madame de Fremont,</HI> and her Son; yet they &s;olicited under-hand for the&s;e. They con&s;idered, that be&s;ides that the Me|mory of the decea&s;ed ought to be dear unto them, not only becau&s;e he was the Father of the Mare&s;hal's

Lady, but becau&s;e he had been a great Benefactor to them, both before and after their Marriage. They ought therefore, to do all that was in their Power, for &s;aving his E&s;tate from being &s;eized. They thought it was very likely, that though the Stroak could not fall upon them&s;elves, becau&s;e of the Precautions they had taken, both in their Marriage Contract, and in the Gifts they had afterwards received, yet it might fall upon their Daughter, who in&s;tead of having the 100000 Crowns, that <HI>Madame de Frem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nt</HI> and Mr. <HI>d'Onneuil</HI> were willing to pay her, &s;he might be in hazard of lo&s;ing the whole of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e Solicitations and under-hand Dealings, how clo&s;e &s;oever they were kept, yet came to the Duke's Ears, and enraged him to a greater degree, again&s;t his Father in law and Mother in law; &s;o that it was ob|&s;erved of him, that he took as much pains, to ob|tain what he had de&s;ired of the Council, as he did Four or Five Years ago, to &s;hun the Weight of King <HI>William</HI> of <HI>England</HI>'s Arm. But all the pains he took, turned at la&s;t to his Confu&s;ion, for he was ca&s;t before the Council, and the only thing that the Chancellor &s;aid to him that could plea&s;e him, becau&s;e of the Hatred he bore to his Ladie's Grandmother and Uncle, was, that when &s;uch People as the decea&s;ed had been, did marry their Daughters or Grandaughters to Per|&s;ons of Quality, it was the fir&s;t Step they made, to re&s;tore to the Publick, what they had robb'd it of, but by the good leave of that Magi&s;trate, I do not think, that the Name of Re&s;titution, agrees well to &s;uch an Action as that. For to re&s;tore a thing, is to give it back, after it has been taken, and to give it back to the rightful Owner too; but for a Man to loaden his Children or Grandchildren with Money, and by great Wealth to purcha&s;e to them a Blood that cannot mix with theirs, without &s;ome &s;ort of Shame, and then to call this Re&s;titution, was an odd way of &s;peaking; and it is the fir&s;t time I ever heard it call'd &s;o. The Duke <HI>de Lau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">un,</HI>

But I do not know, if it be enough for a man to think upon it, only as he did; for I think if a man be as much concerned in it, as he ought to be, he mu&s;t join Effects and Deeds to his Thoughts, whatever may be the Re&s;ult of them. However, this Bu&s;ine&s;s made as great noi&s;e, as the pretended hidden Trea&s;ure did, of which I gave ju&s;t now an Ac|count. One of the&s;e Farmers of the Revenues, (who&s;e
<PB N="148" REF="149">
Name I have forgot) died, and left Two Children, behind him, who did not live in great Friend&s;hip to|gether; which happens often betwixt Brothers. The Father had in his Will con&s;idered the one, much more than the other; with which this la&s;t was very ill plea|&s;ed, and re&s;olved to make his Brother unea&s;ie, and threatned to tell Mr. <HI>Fonchartrain,</HI> of their decea&s;ed Father's Management; unle&s;s he would let him have an equal &s;hare in the E&s;tate. I know not if he was &s;uch a Fool to do what he threatned, or if one who had been his Father's Clerk, had done as Mr. <HI>Fre|mont</HI>'s Clerk did. But <HI>Mr. Ponchartrain,</HI> being in|formed &s;oon after their Father's Death, that there was &s;omething found among his Papers, that might turn to the King's Advantage; he &s;ent a Commi&s;&s;ary from <HI>Paris,</HI> to &s;eal up all the Papers, which he had in the place where he died. It was within the Ge|nerality of <HI>Alencon;</HI> and Mr. <HI>de Pommereu</HI>'s Son, who was Intendant of it, receiving Orders to be pre&s;ent, when the Cabinets, Coffers <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were to be &s;ealed; the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s was done, with all the Precautions, that could po&s;&s;ibly be taken, in a matter, wherein they were afraid to be cheated. And the Intendant left a Garri&s;on to continue there, till the Seals &s;hould be taken off. This Bu&s;ine&s;s fright|ned all the <HI>Parti&s;ans,</HI> who were afraid, their Chil|dren and Goods might be u&s;ed the &s;ame way after their Deaths. But becau&s;e in the time of &s;o burthen|&s;ome a War, the Court had often need of them, it was not thought convenient to di&s;courage them, and therefore a Report was &s;pread among the People, that the rea&s;on why the Papers <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the decea&s;ed were &s;ealed up, was becau&s;e he had made a Will in favour of the King. When they had ob&s;erved all the Forms that were u&s;ual on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, &s;o that there was no rea&s;on could be given for any farther delay, the Intendant returned from <HI>Alencon,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the opening of the Seals, which was done with all the u&s;ual Formalities, and in the Inventory of the Papers
<PB N="149" REF="150">
which had been left by the Decea&s;ed; it was found there were Two Papers, by which the Parti&s;an had declared, that God had given him Grace to examine his Con&s;cience, and that he would not adventure to go into the other World, without re&s;toring what he had taken wrongfully. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e Papers, which clearly appeared to have been fir&s;t done, tho' it was neither dated or &s;igned; he &s;aid, that he had by indirect and unju&s;t methods, gain'd 100000 Crowns, during the time he had been concerned in the Revenues, &s;o that it was his Will, that his Heirs might re&s;tore that Sum to the King; as for the other Paper, it was found to have been written after the former, for it contained a Declaration, that after a mature and &s;erious Reflection, upon all the Bu&s;ine&s;s he had been concerned in, he found that he had made an un|ju&s;t Acqui&s;ition of 400000 Livers; &s;o that it was his Will, that his Children &s;hould re&s;tore it to his Maje&s;ty, out of his E&s;tate. The Intendant &s;ent Copies of the two Papers to Mr. <HI>Pontchartrain,</HI> who in &s;uch a matter, would not rely upon his own Judgment, which was, that tho' they were not dated or &s;igned, &s;o that they would not &s;ignifie any thing between Two private Per|&s;ons; yet it might be otherwi&s;e, when the King was concerned in them. He therefore con&s;ulted all tho&s;e, whom he thought capable to determine &s;o nice a Que|&s;tion; &s;ome were of one opinion, and &s;ome of another. Tho&s;e who were more for the Forms of Law, than for material Ju&s;tice, did not think that the Heirs of the decea&s;ed could be &s;ued in Law; &s;eeing &s;uch Papers were not regarded in any Court of Ju&s;tice. But on the other hand, tho&s;e who followed the Maxims of Mr. <HI>Pu&s;&s;ort</HI> the late Dean of the Council, (who, as I have already &s;aid, voted always in the King's favour whether his Maje&s;ty was Plaintiff or Defendant) made u&s;e of his Authority to prove, that the King had good rea&s;on to demand the 400000 Livers mentioned in the la&s;t of the Two Papers.</P>

Be&s;ides this Authority, which they reckoned upon as a Law, that had taken place in the time of a great Mini&s;ter, who had reformed the State, and had put the King's Affairs into an excellent Condition; by the prodigious Taxes that had been laid upon the Par|ti&s;ans; they alleged al&s;o, that when a man did ac|knowledge, in a Paper written with his own Hand, that he had unju&s;tly acquired &s;uch a Sum of money, that was by a Thou&s;and times a more convincing Proof, than all the other Proofs; that could po&s;&s;ibly be had. <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ieur Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">chartr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">in</HI> was much of the &s;ame opinion, as the truth is, a man can hardly be of a|nother: Yet there are certain Rules of Law, which mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, lea&s;t the Laws them&s;elves, to which they r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">late, &s;hould be violated: And therefore he &s;pake nothing either for it, or again&s;t it, unle&s;s that it was to be wi&s;hed, that all the Parti&s;ans, which had been formerly taxed, had done as this man did; &s;ince that would have been an e&s;tabli&s;hed Rule by which the King might have legally demanded, what they had cheated him of.

Though the King had been already nece&s;&s;itated to make a great many Edicts, yet he was &s;till obliged to make new ones; and one among the re&s;t, which gave occa&s;ion to a witty Ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Duke de Ferte</HI>'s, at lea&s;t it was reckoned witty, by &s;ome little pretenders to Wit; though I confe&s;s, I am not of their mind, whether it be that I am but an ill Judg, or that they have been mi&s;taken at that time. This Edict was concerning Coats of Arms belonging to Families. All the People of Quality were &s;triving, who &s;hould make the be&s;t Projects for bringing in Money to the King; for they knew His Maje&s;ty would reward them for it; and mo&s;t of them had need of &s;ome reward, becau&s;e of the great Expence they were at, in the Army and at Court. The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Ro|quelaure</HI> was the Author of this Project, and had a good Re|ward for it, and being come to <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> &s;ome days after, with a very rich Petticoat; many of tho&s;e little Pretenders who were &s;tanding round about the Duke <HI>de la Ferte,</HI> who made them &s;ometimes laugh, de&s;ired him to take notice of that rich Petticoat, and to admire it.

Tho&s;e who were with the Duke asked him, why the King went &s;o often thither, he &s;aid, he did not exactly know what might be his Maje&s;ty's Rea&s;on, but he gue&s;&s;ed, that the General Peace being now upon the point of being concluded; &s;o that K. <HI>James</HI> could not &s;tay any longer in that Kingdom: The King went to ac|quaint him with the Article of Six Months &s;tay: Every bo|dy was per&s;waded, that &s;eeing by this Peace, the King was to acknowledge King <HI>William</HI> for Rightful King of Great Britain; K. <HI>James</HI> would not &s;tay and &s;ee his Amba&s;&s;adors come to His Maje&s;ty's Court, and that therefore he would go to <HI>Rome,</HI> or at lea&s;t to <HI>Avignon,</HI> to conceal his Misfortunes. But as he has learned by the Exerci&s;es of Piety and Devotion, which he has practi&s;ed the&s;e many Years pa&s;t, to take the &s;adde&s;t events as from the hand of God; &s;o it is now found, that the Duke <HI>de la F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rte,</HI> was out in his gue&s;&s;ing, when he thought that this Prince would &s;oon leave S. <HI>Germains.</HI> Yet K. <HI>James</HI> re&s;olved not to let the Peace be concluded, without making the Confederates &s;en&s;ible, that the Alliance they had entered into, with K. <HI>William,</HI> for &s;etting him upon his Throne, might be of dangerous con&s;equence to them&s;elves. He cau|&s;ed a <HI>Manife&s;to</HI> to be drawn up, and copies of it to be given to all the Mini&s;ters of Princes and States, that were concerned in the Conferences at <HI>Re&s;wick.</HI> In this <HI>Manife&s;to,</HI> he vindica|ted him&s;elf from an Imputation, that his Subjects had char|ged

him with; which was, that he had been always &s;o &s;trict|ly in the Kings Intere&s;ts, that he would never enter into any Treaty, with any other Potentates, for reducing his Power which was become formidable to all <HI>Europe.</HI> And the Confe|derates them&s;elves, who had often endeavoured to gain him, but could never prevail (whether it was that he was really in his Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t, or that he thought it was for his own Intere&s;t, not to engage in War again&s;t him) made al&s;o u&s;e of the &s;ame pret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">xt, when they de&s;erted him. For when he &s;ent &s;ome of his Servants to their Courts, (after K. <HI>William</HI> was entered into <HI>England</HI>) and de&s;ired them, that they would not give any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to that Prince, they met with &s;o very cold a reception, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to find its Parallel. And the Pope him&s;elf did as it were mock at him, &s;o that the Per&s;on whom he &s;ent to <HI>Rome,</HI> brought nothing back, but Beads in&s;tead of Summs of Money; tho' he informed his H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">line&s;s, that the true Rea&s;on of his Misfortunes, was, that he had zeal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;ly endeavoured to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Roman Ca|tholick Religion in his Dominions; but how much &s;oever it was the Pope's Intere&s;t to have protected him upon that ac|count: Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Holine&s;s had his own &s;hare in tho&s;e fears, which the King's great Power gave to all the other Princes of <HI>Europe;</HI> &s;o that he would not hearken, either to what Religion advi&s;ed him to, or to what the Ordinary Intere&s;t of Popes u&s;es to &s;ugge&s;t to them on &s;uch occa&s;ions. After K. <HI>James</HI> had publi&s;hed his <HI>Manife&s;to,</HI> he met with the &s;ame treatment be had met with before; for tho' he clear'd him&s;elf, as well as he could, from the accu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ation I have already mentioned; and endeavoured al&s;o to make the Con&s;ederates &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ble, that they might come to fall under as great Misfortunes, as had befallen him, if they &s;hould &s;ufter that by the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eaty of Peace, which was upon the point of being concluded, the Prince of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> &s;hould be acknowledged King of <HI>England:</HI> Yet they did not think it convenient, to treat him better than they had done before.

This accknowledgment did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uch perplex that Prince, who went upon &s;ure grounds: For in the Articles of Peace propos'd by the King, when his Plenipotentaries offer'd to &s;tate that Article, he advis'd 'em to da&s;h it out, becau&s;e he knew, very well, how to keep up the Dignity confer'd upon him by the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> with the Succours of his People and Allies: So that this Que&s;tion was to bear no Fi|gure among tho&s;e conte&s;ted by the re&s;pective Parties.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Armies, pur&s;uant to their u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, made preparations for the Field; and the King having re-enforc'd his Troops, with tho&s;e he had recall'd from <HI>Italy,</HI> would not li&s;ten to the Truce that was offer'd to him by the Allies.

But Soldiers do not always examine things &s;o nicely; whoever has the General Com|mand, they impute all their good or bad Succe&s;s to him. The whole Army regretted the lo&s;s of their late General. Be&s;ides, there was a va&s;t difference between him, and tho&s;e who fill'd his Po&s;t.

the Duke of <HI>Mazarin</HI> frequently repented that he had made him his Son-in-Law.

The Marchione&s;s of <HI>Seignelay</HI> was a proper match for him, both for E&s;tate and Quality. She was very hand&s;ome, and her Age bore a &s;uitable proportion to his. But this Lady, being the Widdow of a Mini&s;ter of State, in who&s;e life-time every body &s;toop'd to her, &s;tood upon the point of Honour, when &s;he preceiv'd that the Duke's Agents pretended, that &s;he behov'd to give the Duke con&s;iderable odds,
<PB N="6" REF="159">
becau&s;e &s;he had Children; after which &s;he would never hear of the Propo&s;al agen.

His Mother-in-Law, not di&s;courag'd by this an&s;wer, renew'd the at|tack &s;everal times.

<PB N="7" REF="160">
that <HI>that</HI> was not the way to win, or break him, he re-doubled his vi&s;its to the Marchione&s;s of <HI>Bellefonds.</HI> This put the Old Woman into a Pa&s;&s;ion. She teaz'd her Son-in-Law &s;o ince&s;&s;antly, that he was oblig'd to tell her, he would either take away his Wife to an|other Hou&s;e (for they liv'd all together, the Mother-in-Law and her Husband being oblig'd, by the Contract of Marriage, to give them both Lodging and Diet) or el&s;e Dine and Sup always abroad. And, indeed, he was as good as his word: But when he &s;aw all his Remon|&s;trances were ineffectual, he began to lye out in the Night: &s;ometimes in the <HI>Bagnio</HI>'s, and &s;ometimes in <HI>Luxemburg-Hou&s;e,</HI> which was &s;till furni&s;h'd. But all this was &s;o far from producing the propo&s;ed Effect, that his Mo|ther-in-Law grew &s;till more unea&s;y, and trou|ble&s;ome, in&s;omuch, that he was quickly oblig'd to leave her for good and all.</P>
<P>This Duke had three Brethren, and two Si&s;t|ers, one of which Married the Prince of <HI>Neu|&s;chattel,</HI> as I intimated above; The other was &s;hut up in a Convent, but would willingly have come out if &s;he could.

However, Count <HI>Olonne,</HI> who was worth almo&s;t forty Thou&s;and Livers a Year, having no Children, re&s;olv'd to marry Chevalier <HI>Rohan,</HI> his Brother, in hopes that the Off-&s;pring would not re&s;emble the Father. There being few Ladies of Quality, tho' never &s;o Ordinary and Poor, that would accept of him for a Husband; He fix'd upon one of his own Cou&s;ins that had nothing, namely, <HI>Mademoi&s;elle Noirmoutier,</HI> Si&s;ter to the Dutche&s;|&s;es of <HI>Brachiane,</HI> and <HI>Lanti:</HI> She was likewi&s;e of the <HI>Tremouille</HI> Family, and the Daughter of the Duke of <HI>Noirmoutier,</HI> who had &s;o great a hand in the fir&s;t <HI>Paris</HI> War. As &s;oon as he open'd the matter to her, &s;he trembled from top to toe, as being acquainted with the Character of her de&s;ign'd Husband; but his promi&s;e of &s;ettling his whole E&s;tate upon his Brother, in ca&s;e the marriage went on, and a great many other things that he repre&s;ented to her as matter of Comfort, did &s;o tame her, that &s;he pre&s;ently comply'd. And thus &s;he married the Man in the World, that de&s;erv'd lea&s;t to be Lov'd; and upon other &s;cores, had &s;o little knowledge of his own Character, that &s;ome time after, when &s;ome Citizens came to Game at her Hou&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e of 'em, not knowing the Chevalier, and &s;ee|ing him offer her a Seat, bid him give her an|other, becau&s;e that one did not plea&s;e her <HI>Mademoi&s;elle Noirmoutier,</HI> who then enjoy'd the Title of Marchione&s;s of <HI>Rohan,</HI> was oblig'd to put up a great many other Affronts.

his Heir, was &s;o &s;harp &s;et, that he would give him nothing while he Liv'd.

She, and Madam <HI>Theron,</HI> won twenty Thou&s;and Crowns of him, at one bout; and upon &s;uch lo&s;&s;es, it being natural to offer &s;ome Plea or o|ther for not paying, he did not do as Mr. <HI>Ver|thamont</HI> did; for in&s;tead of paying the Money without any words, in order to &s;tifle the &s;can|dal, he gave it out, that he was Cheated. The Chancellor di&s;pleas'd with his Conduct, told him, 'Twas a &s;orry Excu&s;e, and that when the King had catch'd a Man cheating him, he ex|pell'd him the Court; which was a Le&s;&s;on for others, that it behov'd him to follow. In fine, he gave him twenty Thou&s;and Crowns to be deliver'd to tho&s;e that won that &s;umm of him. The Marchione&s;s of <HI>Rohan,</HI> had &s;everal &s;uch little Jobbs, which help'd her out while &s;he wait|ed for Count <HI>Olonne</HI>'s Death: At la&s;t he Died, as well as her Husband, who left her only one Daughter. Upon this, &s;he re&s;olv'd to breed up her Daughter as a great Heire&s;s, and to enjoy her &s;elf. But, as the &s;aying is, Man propo&s;es, and God di&s;po&s;es. Her &s;elf was &s;natch'd away &s;oon after 'em. She was &s;eiz'd with a violent Pain in a very &s;en&s;ible Part; and to appea&s;e the un&s;ufferable Pain, and procure her &s;ome Re&s;t, &s;he took a Do&s;e of <HI>Opium</HI> that was &s;omewhat &s;tronger than ordinary, immediately after the taking of it, &s;he &s;lept effectualy, but &s;o as never to awake; for next Day &s;he was found Dead in her Bed.

&s;o tho&s;e that had an intere&s;t in the Confi&s;cation of the Ship, took occa&s;ion to ac|quaint the King, that Mr. <HI>Cavoy,</HI> in con&s;idera|tion of a private Intere&s;t, had caus'd a &s;eizure to be re&s;tor'd without a valuable Ran&s;ome.

The Amba&s;&s;ador went thither, and having lo&s;t all his Money, began to play upon tick. An Adventurer that play'd at the &s;ame place, and lo&s;t his Money as well as the Marquis, being out of Humour, happened to &s;ay, <HI>'Twas a &s;trange thing to &s;ee Men loo&s;e their money every day, and yet play upon Credit.</HI> The Gentleman &s;poke it with reference to &s;ome others that di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves that way, as well as the Amba&s;&s;ador.

But 'tis certain, that tho' this Knight was not much talk'd of in his Life-time, yet it was otherwi&s;e after his Death. He made a <HI>Will</HI> that many wonder'd at; which was much of the &s;ame Nature with that made by the Farmer of the Revenues mentioned in the Fir&s;t Part of this Work: Nay, it was rather more valid; for in&s;tead of choo&s;ing &s;oft &s;mooth Words, to &s;ignify that he had cheated the King, he downright own|ed him&s;elf guilty of <HI>Robbery.</HI> He &s;et forth, in plain terms, that he had Robb'd the King of twen|ty Thou&s;and Livers, while he was Governor of the Place above-mention'd; and order'd his Heirs to make Re&s;titution of the &s;ame, before they ap|propriated to them&s;elves one Farthing of his E|&s;tate.

He drew this check upon him&s;elf, by boa&s;ting of &s;ome in|telligence he had receiv'd of the Enemy: For the Mar&s;hal being a proud Man, did not like &s;uch doings, alledging, That they in&s;inuated an accu&s;a|tion again&s;t him, as if he had not taken all the ne|ce&s;&s;ary Mea&s;ures for having as good intelligence as he.

Some time after, the King de&s;igning a review of that Regiment, <HI>Boufflers</HI> made his review fir&s;t, in order to remedy all Deficiencies before the King &s;aw them.

Intere&s;t to prevent &s;uch an occa&s;ion of &s;candal in his Army, in which the mea&s;ures of Subordinati|on mu&s;t always be maintain'd, order'd <HI>Rubantel</HI> to be reprimanded by the <HI>Marquis de Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> the Son of the <HI>Marquis de Louvois,</HI> who had Died &s;uddenly, and who&s;e place of Secretary of State he had &s;ucceeded to. This did not make <HI>Rubantel</HI> the wi&s;er; for upon &s;everal other occa|&s;ions, he di&s;play'd an impatience in being &s;ubject to the Mar&s;hal; upon which the King was &s;o An|gry, that he re&s;olv'd to take his Commi&s;&s;ion from him. His Maje&s;ty di&s;cover'd part of his mind to the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut,</HI> who told him, that tho' <HI>Rubantel</HI> was in the wrong, yet, if his Ma|je&s;ty would be pleas'd to con&s;ider the Ca&s;e, he would find that his Crime, as great as it was, did not de&s;erve &s;o &s;evere a Puni&s;hment; that he had been Captain of the Guards Forty Years; and tho' he was bound to give a blind Obedience to whatever Superiour his Maje&s;ty plac'd over him, yet con&s;idering 'twas natural for a Man not to love to &s;ee him&s;elf commanded by another that had been long his Inferior, 'twas very po&s;&s;ible for him to depart from his Duty.

<P>Another Officer in the Army was yet more un|fortunate than <HI>Rubantel;</HI> for after being impri&s;on|ed in the <HI>Ba&s;tile,</HI> and lo&s;ing his Regiment which was worth better than ten thou&s;and Crowns a Year, he had never obtain'd his liberty if the Peace had not been made: This was a Son of the Duke of <HI>Tirconnel</HI>'s, by a Lady that he had promis'd marriage to, tho he never perform'd his Promi&s;e. His Name was <HI>Talbot,</HI> which was like|wi&s;e the Duke's Name, and is a Name very famous both in <HI>England,</HI> and in <HI>France,</HI> from whence that Hou&s;e deriv'd its Original. He was a Brigadeer in the Army in <HI>Italy,</HI> and had a Regiment there. He came from that Country to Court, about two or three Years ago, at the time when King <HI>James</HI> pretended to Sail for <HI>England,</HI> upon which King <HI>James</HI> bid <HI>Talbot</HI> follow him; but <HI>Talbot</HI> made An&s;wer, <HI>That tho' he had an</HI> Iri&s;h <HI>Regiment, yet being in the Service and Pay of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, he could not di&s;po&s;e of his Per&s;on without His Maje&s;ty</HI>'s <HI>leave; and that if he would be &s;o kind as to &s;peak of it to the King, he would be glad to obey his Commands.</HI> I know not whether <HI>Talbot</HI> &s;poke the&s;e words with &s;uch an Air as &s;ig|nifyed his unwillingne&s;s to go; or whether that Prince took it ill, that one of his Subjects &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>He could not obey him without his mo&s;t Chri&s;ti|an Maje&s;ty's leave.</HI> But, in fine, Kine <HI>James</HI> di&s;co|ver'd by his Countenance, that he had forgot, that <HI>Talbot</HI> was the Son of a Man that had done him great Service; and to this Day, is, by all that know him, e&s;teem'd the mo&s;t faithful and affecti|onate to his Prince, of any that we have &s;een for a long time. <HI>Talbot</HI> perceiv'd this as well as the re&s;t: But whether it was that he did not trouble him&s;elf about it, or that Wine which he lov'd too well, had &s;unk his Judgment; He told that

very Day to the <HI>Marquis de Larr&eacute;,</HI> at a Drinking|match, what had pa&s;s'd between King <HI>James</HI> and him, adding withall, very imprudently, whether through the influence of Wine, or real Thought, <HI>That he could not imagine what that Prince mean'd to do in</HI> England; <HI>and that he was re&s;pected or be|lov'd by very few; every body almo&s;t being per&s;wad|ed that he was a thou&s;and times fitter for a Con|vent, than for the Throne.</HI> Next Day, the <HI>Mar|quis de Larr&eacute;</HI> vi&s;ited the <HI>Marquis de Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> with whom he was in Favour, and gave him an account of what pa&s;s'd between him and <HI>Talbot,</HI> thinking, perhaps, rather to do him Service, than to injure him. For the purpo&s;e, he might have in his view to inform that Mini&s;ter of his inviol|able Affection to the King's Service, upon the compari&s;on with K. <HI>James</HI>'s. But the Marquis of <HI>Barbe&s;ieux</HI> having told the Story to a Lady that he Courted, and &s;he having told it to the Queen of <HI>England;</HI> This Prince&s;s &s;ollicited the King to cau&s;e <HI>Talbot</HI> to be taken up. Accordingly he was taken up at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and carried to the <HI>Ba&s;tile,</HI> believing that a Prince of K. <HI>James</HI>'s Devotion, would confine his re&s;entment to a few days Im|pri&s;onment. But as devout People are &s;eldom guilty of granting Pardons, or at lea&s;t, have no great Name for it; &s;o he was quickly made to under&s;tand, that K. <HI>James</HI> had a mind to have him broke. The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Tirconnel,</HI> being a Lady of Honour to the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> us'd her endeavours to prev&egrave;nt the Blow, that was about to reduce that poor Gentleman to the State he was in when he came from his Mother's Belly. For tho' he had &s;erv'd a long time, and had great Incomes, yet he had been &s;o carele&s;s a Husband, that he could &s;carce rai&s;e two thou&s;and Crown<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon all he had.

<PB N="27" REF="180">
But His Maje&s;ty reply'd, <HI>That it did not lie at his door; and that if the King and Queen of</HI> England <HI>did not de&s;ire him to be broke, he was &s;atisfied.</HI> But, at the &s;ame time, he ju&s;tly blam'd him for drawing that Di&s;grace upon him&s;elf; and the Mar&s;hal could not excu&s;e it otherwi&s;e than upon the &s;core of Wine, which often &s;inks the Rea&s;on of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Men. Mr. <HI>de Vend&ocirc;me</HI> inter|ceeded likewi&s;e on his behalf: But 'twas all in vain: For K. <HI>James,</HI> and his Queen, made not only his Regiment, but a Pen&s;ion, that he had, to be taken from him. And thus he had the morti|fication of &s;eeing him&s;elf unplum'd by one &s;troak of his Tongue of all the Fruit of his Services. And which is yet wor&s;e, tho', at pre&s;ent, he is at liberty, I do not know that he has yet obtain'd any thing, tho' I &s;ee him every day going from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and from <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> to St. <HI>Germains.</HI> He has been a long time, without obtaining leave of K. <HI>James,</HI> and his Queen, to come and beg their pardon; their Maje&s;ties thinking it proper to &s;hew that their Re&s;entment continues &s;till.</P>
<P>Among all this matter of Affliction, e&s;pecially to <HI>Talbot</HI> and <HI>Rubantel,</HI> as well as their Friends, there happened a new Scene at <HI>Paris,</HI> that may be entertaining to the Publick: The Wife of one that belonged to the Pay-Office, a very Coquette Lady in her way, had one day a mind to ride in her Coach. Her Coach-man having combin'd with &s;ome of her Servants to play her a trick, got upon his Coach-box, without dre&s;&s;ing his Hor&s;es, or cleaning the Coach. The Lady ask'd him what he mean'd by &s;erving a Per&s;on of her Quality in that fa&s;hion. Her Quality, after all, was not very great; but &s;ince Madam <HI>du Fre&s;noi,</HI> the Wife of a common Citizen's Son, when &s;peaking of her &s;elf, took upon her to &s;ay, <HI>A Woman of my Qua|lity;</HI> by the &s;ame rea&s;on, this good Woman might call her&s;elf a Lady of Quality; for both her own,
<PB N="28" REF="181">
and her Husband's Father, were &s;omething more than the others. However, the Coach-man gave her no An&s;wer, knowing that nothing provokes a Woman more than not an&s;wering her, whether &s;he be in the right, or the wrong. She redoubled her repri|mands to make him &s;peak; and finding that he was &s;till mute, attack'd him with threats and hard words: At la&s;t the Coach-man, very unconcernedly, an&s;wered her, <HI>That &s;he made a great deal of noi&s;e for a &s;mall matter; and if &s;he would take his ad|vice, &s;he &s;hould give over bawling, and make no more words of it.</HI> The Lady inrag'd with &s;uch an in&s;olent An&s;wer, redoubled her threats and abu&s;ive Language: But the Coach-man having kept the be&s;t to the la&s;t, told her, <HI>That he wondered that &s;uch a one as &s;he &s;hould be &s;o ill to plea&s;e, and that &s;he was too well &s;erved for a W&mdash;</HI>At that word &s;he was out of all Patience, and called up her Foot-men, who had &s;heer'd off on purpo&s;e to have the more Diver&s;ion by the Comedy. They ran up to her all in a heat to know her Plea&s;ure. She ask'd them to act for her in being reveng'd upon that in&s;olent Fellow. The Foot-men pretending to know nothing of the matter; &s;he gave them to know, that he had the impudence to call her W&mdash;and that the lea&s;t they could do was to break his Arms, or Legs: But &s;he was mightily &s;urpriz'd, when, in&s;tead of being provok'd, as &s;he expected, they looked down. Then &s;he ask'd them what they mean'd by it? and forc'd them to &s;peak as if it had been again&s;t their Wills. Their An&s;wer, which was much more provaking than any thing &s;he had yet heard, was, <HI>That if &s;he wanted only to have her Coach-man beaten, &s;he might go &s;ee for other Executioners; that they would not beat or thra&s;h any body without a ju&s;t Cau&s;e; and that they did not take &s;peaking of the Truth to be &s;uch.</HI> She reply'd, <HI>That it &s;eemed they took her to be a W&mdash;as well as the Coach-man did.</HI> And they An|&s;wer'd,
<PB N="29" REF="182">
very freely, <HI>That they knew her to be &s;uch, and were ready to witne&s;s it when &s;he pleas'd.</HI> This rais'd her Pa&s;&s;ion to that degree, that &s;he called upon the re&s;t of her Servants to give her the &s;uc|cour that her Foot-men had refu&s;ed. The fir&s;t that appear'd was Mi&s;tre&s;s Cook, who ask'd her what put her in &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion; the Lady had no &s;ooner told her the matter, but &s;he made an&s;wer, <HI>That the Coach-man and Foot-men were not much to blame; and that they charg'd her with nothing that was not true.</HI> Then came in the Chamber-maid, who, not being in the Con&s;piracy with the re&s;t, &s;aid, <HI>That 'twas not worth her while to make &s;o many words, and that &s;he would go and call a Commi&s;&s;ary to put them all in Pri&s;on:</HI> But that word co&s;t her very dear; for as &s;oon as they &s;aw her making ready to go out, they fell upon her, and beat her one after another. The Lady fled to her Chamber for fear they &s;hould give her as much: And, at la&s;t, the Chamber-maid got clear, and fled likewi&s;e to her Chamber. Both of them bolted their doors, and continued there waiting for the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, in order to complain of the u&s;age they had received. The Coach-man perceiving that his Mi&s;tre&s;s was mew'd up, took the Hor&s;es from the Coach, and curry'd them: And, in a word, did all that was to be done, in order to make it appear upon his Ma&s;ter's return, that his Mi&s;tre&s;s was in the wrong. But both he, and his accom|plices, had us'd another precaution, that was yet better. They had complain'd four days a-go to the Commi&s;&s;ary of the Ward, that &s;he would not pay them their Wages; and having, at the &s;ame time, given a Summons in order to have her ca&s;t in Court, they only &s;tay'd in the Hou&s;e till the Husband came; and before his Wife could &s;peak with him, gave him to know, that they would &s;tay no longer with her, becau&s;e they could not get a Far|thing out of her hands. The Husband would have
<PB N="30" REF="183">
kept them, but they did not care to &s;tay. After they were all gone, he was &s;urpriz'd with an ac|count of the tricks they had plaid with his Wife. Had he been wi&s;e, he would have advis'd her not to &s;peak of the matter to any body, and would have taken the &s;ame advice to him&s;elf: But as every Man is not as wi&s;e as his Affairs require, &s;o he was the fool to go him&s;elf and complain of his Servants; and thus was the fir&s;t that divulg|ed what he ought to have conceal'd: But the Com|plaint given in by the Servants four days before, made People believe, that whatever he &s;aid, was by way of Recrimination. Upon which, his Friends advis'd him to drop the thing, and make no more noi&s;e of it. They had much ado to per&s;wade him; for his Wife threw in all the fire &s;he could to di&s;&s;wade him: But at la&s;t, his own Rea&s;on con|vinced him, that <HI>that</HI> was his only way, unle&s;s he had a mind to make him&s;elf to be pointed at as he walked along the Streets.</P>
<P>As this Lady was branded for a <HI>Coquette</HI> by her Servants; &s;o I pre&s;ent you with a &s;tory of an|other, that, indeed, had not that misfortune, but was no le&s;s &s;uch in her Husband's Opinion. Mr. <HI>Tourville,</HI> before he was made a Mar&s;hal of <HI>France,</HI> married the Daughter of a Farmer Ge|neral; who was the Widdow of the Marquis of <HI>Poplinicre,</HI> the Nephew of the late Madam <HI>Col|bert.</HI> 'Twas a lucky hit for the Mar&s;hal to mar|ry that Lady, e&s;pecially at the time when it hap|pened; for he was only a younger Brother in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and that of a Family that was in no great Circum&s;tances: But Fortune &s;tood by him, when every body thought he was lo&s;t. We mu&s;t know, that after the Marquis of <HI>Seignelay,</HI> his Pro|tector, was Dead, he was writ to from Court, that then was the time, or never, to &s;hew his mettle; for he had never given proof of it all the time that he was employ'd as a <HI>Marine.</HI>

This Reproach &s;erv'd for a Spur that twitch|ed him to the Quick, in&s;omuch, that when he re|ceiv'd Orders to Fight the Enemies Fleet at any rate, he did his Duty; and tho' he was unfortu|nate in the way of Succe&s;s; yet he was there|upon prefer'd to that degree, that if he had &s;till been unmarried, he could, perhaps, have de&s;ired no more of that Woman. But, whether it was that he began to &s;light her, or that, he thought, he might keep Company with Mi&s;&s;es, without giv|ing her any di&s;&s;atisfaction; He had a &s;weet Eye upon one of his Neighbours, that &s;he was as jealous of, as of another. She told him her Sentiments of the thing; and not only took the pains to undeceive him, but made a noi&s;e that was very trouble&s;ome to the Lady, that &s;he deem'd her for her Rival. I cannot be po&s;itive upon the truth of the matter; but 'tis &s;aid, that this jealous Lady acquainted the Womans Husband with the Mar&s;hal's intimacy with her. 'Tis likewi&s;e Re|ported, that the Husband &s;urprized them in a po&s;ture that did not allow him to doubt of the information he had received. Whatever was in it, the Woman was put into a Convent; and the Mar&s;hal, either out of the chagrin occa&s;ion'd by her confinement, or through the di&s;content his La|dy had given him upon other occa&s;ions, &s;ent her out of <HI>Paris</HI> to one of his own Territories. His Plea was, that &s;he would not do &s;omething that he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> de&s;ired of her; and the pretence was the more &s;pecious, that it related to his Intere&s;t. But the Lady bore her Bani&s;hment from Town the more impatiently, that &s;he was eternally galled with jealou&s;ie, and return'd to <HI>Paris</HI> without giving him notice. She Lodged in his Apartment, de|&s;igning to lie &s;o clo&s;e, that he &s;hould know nothing of the matter, till her own Friends, and her fir&s;t Husband's Relations &s;hould have acquainted the King with the inju&s;tice done her. The Mar&s;hal's
<PB N="32" REF="185">
Servants &s;eeing her come into his Hou&s;e, gave notice of it to their Ma&s;ter, who, without asking her the rea&s;on why &s;he returned without his order, complained of it to the King. At the &s;ame time, he de&s;ired His Maje&s;ty to grant him a Warrant to put her into &s;ome Convent, pretending, by that means, to enjoy all her E&s;tate: But His Maje&s;ty being informed of &s;everal things, would not be &s;o ha&s;ty, and de&s;ired, in the fir&s;t place, to know the occa&s;ion of their Divorce. The Mare&s;hal in|deavour'd, by all means, to cover and perplex the Story, and turned it upon the &s;core of Intere&s;t; but the King made An&s;wer, <HI>That Commi&s;&s;ioners ought to be appointed to in&s;pect which of them was in the wrong.</HI> This was all that his Lady de&s;ir|ed; and thus &s;he continued at <HI>Paris</HI> in &s;pight of him, and made it her bu&s;ine&s;s to thwart all his Intrigues.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his Mi&s;&s;es Si&s;ter came to be married; and that being a favourable opportunity of reconciling her to her Husband, the poor re|clu&s;e's Friends invited her to be pre&s;ent at the marriage. He was a little re&s;tive upon the point: However, being unea&s;y in Living alone, and want|ing only to be urged to it, he pretended, that in marrying her, he had not received the &s;ame ad|vantages as they gave to his Si&s;ter-in-Law. If they pleas'd, they might have given him the &s;ame an&s;wer as the Mar&s;hal <HI>Feuillade</HI> gave one day to the Brother of Mr. <HI>Courchamp,</HI> Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts, who is, at pre&s;ent, Ma&s;ter of the King's Hou&s;hold, and Collonel of a Regiment of Foot. He had a mind to be an En&s;ign in the Guards, and that Mar|&s;hal offering to &s;ell him a Commi&s;&s;ion at double the worth, he repre&s;ented to him, that it was not worth &s;o much; upon which the Mar&s;hal re|plied, That he owned it was true; but, withall, that he ought to know, that <HI>that</HI> &s;ort of Po&s;ts were &s;old according to the merit of tho&s;e that pre|tended

to buy 'em; That there was one price for a Man of Quality, and another for &s;uch as he, and in effect, That neither his Phy&s;iognomy, nor his Air, would bring any honour to the Re|giment. I do not in&s;i&s;t upon the Con&s;ideration of his Birth; for that Regiment has been fill'd, I do not know how long, with Men of the &s;ame Degree; and I think the Mar&s;hal had no rea&s;on to inflame the price of the Commi&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e he was only a Trade&s;man's Son. But let that be as it will (as I &s;aid before) the Reclu&s;e's Rela|tion might have alledg'd the &s;ame Rea&s;ons to her Husband: Nay, they had a better Title &s;o to do; for 'tis natural to give with a Girl in Marriage, in proportion to the Circum&s;tances of him that Marries her. In fine, he &s;tood out boldly, not|with&s;tanding that he had a mind to take his Wife home again. He was not pre&s;ent at the Mar|riage, which was accompanied with a &s;ad Scene; for the Bride's Mother, that was well but four Days before, Died the &s;ame day, that the Nup|tial Benediction was pronounced. The Bride|groom, who did not marry any great Beauty, was not much troubled at that Circum&s;tance, becau&s;e he had no great pro&s;pect of Plea&s;ure in her Com|pany. His Bride's Face promi&s;ing but little &s;ati&s;|faction, he willingly ab&s;tain'd from the Duties of a Husband, upon the plea of the lo&s;s of her Mother. But he could not hand&s;omely put it off longer than the &s;econd Night, at which time he was oblig'd to break the Ice: And this comforted the new married Lady, upon the lo&s;s of the fir&s;t Night, e&s;pecially con&s;idering, that &s;he fear'd her Deformity would have eternis'd her Affliction.</P>
<P>Another Lady was Married at the &s;ame time, that would have taken it very ill, if her Husband had thus amus'd him&s;elf with crying and lamentation on the Wedding-Night. 'Twas Madam <HI>Girardin,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="187">
the Widow of Mr. <HI>Girardin,</HI> who was fir&s;t a Lieu|tenant of a Province, and after that, was &s;ent Am|ba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> He had play'd his Game to good purpo&s;e; for upon the Divi&s;ion of his E&s;tate, his Widow had above a hundred thou|&s;and Crowns for her &s;hare, be&s;ides a great quan|tity of Moveables, that was worth half as much. She had likewi&s;e a good Marriage of it, upon other &s;cores, which made her bear a good Figure, in&s;o|much, that many Per&s;ons about Court had her in their Eye: But &s;he lik'd the Marquis of <HI>Canillac</HI> better than any other of her Suitors, tho' he had nothing but his Sword to tru&s;t to. This Lady had two Brethren, one of them Pre&s;ident to the Parliament, and the other Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts, and Intendant of a Province. Fearing they would oppo&s;e her Marriage, if &s;he di&s;covered her De&s;ign, &s;he re&s;olv'd to be Married without giving them any notice. For they were both Lawyers, and fora&s;much as that &s;ort of Men are very &s;harp Sighted where they have any Intere&s;t, &s;he would not be oblig'd either to have recour&s;e to the King to &s;tifle their Oppo&s;ition, or to &s;ecure her&s;elf at Law. Thus was the matter concluded without their knowledge; and it happened, that on the Wedding-Day, the Intendant having arriv'd at <HI>Pa|ris</HI> but twenty four Hours before, &s;ent her word by his Foot-man, That he would come and Dine with her. The Foot-man coming to the Gate, was &s;urpriz'd to find a Porter and Foot-men, with Live|ries different from his; and being introduc'd by one of the&s;e Foot-men into my Ladies Chamber, he found her a Bed with a Man: However, not knowing what the matter mean'd, and not daring to ask any of her Servants, he only deliver'd his Ma&s;ter's Compliment. The Lady made an&s;wer, That truly &s;he had other things to mind, than the giving his Ma&s;ter a Dinner; and that &s;he doubted if &s;he could be &s;tirring, when he &s;hould come to
<PB N="35" REF="188">
Dinner. With the &s;ame Breath, &s;he bid him give her Brother to know, that &s;he only put off the Com|plment to another time; and that then &s;he would acquaint him with the Rea&s;on, why &s;he would not give him a meeting that day. The Air with which &s;he &s;poke the&s;e words, gave the Foot-man to un|der&s;tand, that &s;he lik'd the Trade &s;he had lately taken up. When he return'd, and gave his Ma&s;ter an account of all he &s;aw or heard, the Intendant went immediately to impart the good News to the Pre&s;ident. The Pre&s;ident having known by Experience, what &s;mall &s;tre&s;s ought to be laid on a Woman's Prudence, took the matter at fir&s;t to be Criminal. He thought his Si&s;ter had en|tertain'd a Gallant, and told his Brother, that he would ruine h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r, and that they &s;hould think of expedients to prevent it. The Intendant having a better Opinion of the Women, than his Brother, reply'd, That he was too forward, and that they ought not to Condemn their Si&s;ter upon &s;uch &s;light grounds; and that he believ'd &s;he was Mar|ried, becau&s;e his Foot-man &s;aid, her Servants had changed their Livery. The Pre&s;ident, who upon the hopes of having a &s;hare in her Succe&s;&s;ion, had &s;hewn his Di&s;plea&s;ure upon the apprehen&s;ion of her entertaining a Gallant; was yet more di&s;gu&s;t|ed when he heard of a Husband: And fora&s;much as all his remaining Comfort con&s;i&s;ted in di&s;anul|ling the Marriage, in ca&s;e &s;he had Married a Fortune-Hunter, He &s;ent one of his Foot-men to her Gate, to know what Name &s;he went by. But when his Foot-man return'd, and acquainted him, that her Name was <HI>Canillac,</HI> and that her Hu&s;|band was an Officer in the &s;econd Company of Mu&s;queteers; he then was &s;en&s;ible, that he had nothing to hope for upon that &s;core.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, Mr. <HI>Bignon de Blan&s;i,</HI> Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts, the Nephew of Mr <HI>Pontchar|train,</HI> was likewi&s;e married to Madam <HI>He|bert</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="189">
<HI>Debuc,</HI> the Niece of Madam <HI>Pompone,</HI> and the Daughter of Mr. <HI>Hebert Debuc,</HI> Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts. Mr. <HI>Blan&s;i</HI> was Brother to the Inten|dant of <HI>Piccardy.</HI> His fir&s;t Lady was Mademoi|&s;elle <HI>Brunet,</HI> who died in Child-bed when &s;he was but twenty two Years of Age, and left him no I&s;&s;ue. Some days after his &s;econd marriage, Mr. <HI>Pontchartrain</HI> procur'd him a Commi&s;&s;ion for being a Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts, that might be worth two thou&s;and Livres a Year. He had another Com|mi&s;&s;ion before that brought him no Profit. Tho' after all, tho&s;e who have &s;uch &s;ort of Places, continue &s;till to de&s;ire them, becau&s;e they are not only Po&s;ts of Honour, but make way for others that are more profitable. Mr. <HI>Pontchartrain,</HI> who commonly has the di&s;po&s;al of that &s;ort of things, de&s;ign'd this Po&s;t for Mr. <HI>Harouis,</HI> Son-in-Law to Mr. <HI>Richebourg,</HI> Madam <HI>Pontchartrain</HI>'s Uncle, who, be&s;ides the Honour of being her Kin&s;man, was thereby qualified, not only for this, but for a more con&s;iderable Commi&s;&s;ion. Accordingly he order'd Mr. <HI>Depinet,</HI> one of his Deputies that looks after &s;uch things, to make ready an Act, and carry it to the Chancellor. But this Magi|&s;trate having a grudge again&s;t <HI>Pontchartrain,</HI> in|&s;tead of filling up the blank with <HI>Mr. Harouis</HI> his Name, according to <HI>Mr. Pontchartrain</HI>'s de|&s;ire &s;ignfy'd to him by his Deputy, ask'd him how long a Controller General had offer'd to give Laws to a Chancellor, and at the &s;ame time, gave him to know, that he under&s;tood his own Bu&s;ine&s;s without being taught it, and fill'd up the Blank with the Name of <HI>Arnothon,</HI> Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts. <HI>Depinot</HI> returning to <HI>Mr. Pontchar|train,</HI> gave him an account of the Chancellor's Compliment. <HI>Mr. Pontchartrain</HI> was unwilling to make any noi&s;e, tho' perhaps he had Rea&s;on enough, only after that he did nothing relating to his Office, without &s;peaking fir&s;t to the King; &s;o that it

was not in the Chancellor's Power to thwart him.</P>
<P>Much about the &s;ame time, there happen'd an|other marriage, which I would be loath to in&s;ert here, if it had not given occa&s;ion to one word that was taken notice of. Mr. <HI>de la Ferrier,</HI> the Son of that <HI>Berrier,</HI> who&s;e memory is &s;till odious to all the World, tho' he has been a long time Dead: This Man married his Daughter to the Son of <HI>Des Chiens,</HI> who&s;e Birth and Places bore a near re|&s;emblance to his Father, and all that he did. For tho' he had the Impudence to &s;ay, that he was de&s;cended of a Noble Family, yet all the Country bears witne&s;s, that his Father, and his Ance&s;tors, deriv'd their Extraction from the &s;cum of the People. However, Mr. <HI>de la Ferrier</HI>'s Lady be|ing Grand-Child to the late Mr. <HI>Novion,</HI> fir&s;t Pre&s;ident, his Alliance with that Family, of which his Lady de&s;cended by the Mother-&s;ide, was &s;o mon&s;trous, that all the World cried out, that the Blood of the <HI>Novions</HI> was di&s;grac'd, &s;ince, whereas it was formerly mingled with that of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> in the Per&s;on of the late Count <HI>de Tremes,</HI> Father to the pre&s;ent Duke <HI>de Gevres,</HI> it was now be&s;tow'd upon <HI>Chiens (Dogs.)</HI> But the matter lay here; the&s;e <HI>Chiens</HI> were furni&s;h'd with Golden Teeth; and the Father had got &s;o con&s;i|derably by the Places he had in this War, that the <HI>Novions</HI> were nothing near &s;o con&s;iderable as he. This Mr. <HI>de la Ferriere,</HI> was not reckon'd a Bea&s;t, either in Council, or in his own Dome&s;tick Af|fairs, tho' there was a time, when he pa&s;s'd for a Bankrupt; and upon that fal&s;e Report, 'twas &s;aid, That the King would take all his Places from him, for fear his Poverty &s;hould tempt him to be unju&s;t in the di&s;charge of his Offices. But if we may credit what happen'd &s;oon after the mar|riage of his Daughter, to whom he gave nothing; all this pretended Poverty was only a faint, to

This Petition made his Creditors very unea&s;y. They alledg'd, That &s;ince his own Brethren had thus inform'd again&s;t him, the Council before which they pleaded, and which he endeavour'd to move to Compa&s;&s;ion, by his pretended Poverty, ought not to have any re|gard to his Allegations, for depriving them of their Right. In former times, Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> made u&s;e of much &s;uch another Argument to ruine Mr. <HI>Fouquet;</HI> for Abbot <HI>Fouquet</HI> his Brother revil'd him horridly; and whenever any-body offer'd to plead for him, the Cardinal made An&s;wer, That they did not know Mr. <HI>Fouquet</HI> &s;o well as his Brother; and that by con&s;equence, his Te&s;timony was preferable to theirs. And, in effect, the Ab|bot, who was an odd &s;ort of a Man, being at once the greate&s;t <HI>Braggadochio,</HI> and the greate&s;t Coward in the World: This Abbot, I &s;ay, had a great hand in ruining the Super-Intendant. He pre&s;ented Memorials again&s;t him; and 'tis well known what weight they were of, when the que&s;tion was put, Whether he &s;hould be Arre&s;ted or not. This Abbot was &s;uch a Vaunting Fel|low, that he pretended he would take the Prince, and the Mar&s;hal of <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">quincourt,</HI> by the Beard, to make them repent of their taking up Arms a|gain&s;t the King.

a Fear, that he dur&s;t not venture to go out of <HI>Paris,</HI> without a &s;trong Guard.</P>
<P>Soon after all the&s;e Marriages, a Sentence of Bani&s;hment was granted again&s;t Medemoi&s;elle <HI>de Varennes,</HI> a Lady of Quality, in the Country of <HI>Maine,</HI> who was more known by the Affection that great Prelate had for her, than by the Reputation of her Ance&s;tors. 'Twas &s;aid, that this Affecti|on was the effect of Amorous Embraces; and that her Friend before his Death, advi&s;ed her to marry &s;ome Per&s;on of Quality, that had no|thing, upon Condition, that he &s;hould own her Children to be his. He had made her &s;o rich by his Bounty, that he thought &s;he was in a Condi|tion to tempt every body. 'Tis true, there were a great many poor Wretches, that would have been glad of &s;uch an adventure. But 'twas not that &s;ort of Men, that &s;he had a mind to: Not|with&s;tanding the &s;candalous terms, &s;he pretended &s;till to have her choice, and receiv'd Vi&s;its from all the Court, in a Hou&s;e of hers, that re&s;embled an inchanted Palace. To carry on the Wheedle the better, &s;he entertain'd them very hand&s;omly, and in <HI>Lent</HI> regal'd them with Meat, notwith&s;tand|ing the King's Orders to the contrary. For His Maje&s;ty, to put a &s;top to all manner of Libertini&s;m, had order'd, that only tho&s;e, who were &s;ickly, or otherwi&s;e incommoded, &s;hould have liberty to eat Meat with the Church's Permi&s;&s;ion; and that they &s;hould not let any body &s;hare with them, under the pain of incurring his Di&s;plea&s;ure. But, tho' Madam <HI>Varennes</HI> was far from that Condition, being in very good Health, yet &s;he not only eat of it her&s;elf, but invited all her Vi&s;iters to eat with her. The King got notice of this, and &s;ent her a Letter under the great Seal, to be gone. Her Friends promis'd her a Grant of &s;ome time be|fore &s;he went into Exile: But in&s;tead of mak|ing preparations for her Departure, &s;he promis'd a

thou&s;and Pi&s;tols to Count <HI>Gramont</HI> for procuring a Revocation of the Sentence. Count <HI>Gramont</HI> being a Per&s;on that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts only by the King's Bounty, and at &s;uch Wind-falls does not u&s;e to be a&s;leep: This Count, I &s;ay, did not pretend to deny the thing to the King, that being the wrong way to compa&s;s his De&s;ign; but repre&s;ented to His Maje&s;ty, That the Lady being &s;et all-alone at Ta|ble, where &s;he fed upon Mear, pur&s;uant to a per|mi&s;&s;ion &s;he had from the Curate, &s;ome people came in and &s;urpriz'd her, and, in &s;pite of her Teeth, &s;at down with her; that this was no in|fraction upon the de&s;ign of His Maje&s;ty's Or|der, and that all the World might be catched in the &s;ame Trap, as well as &s;he, without they kept their Gates &s;hut at Meal-times, as in a Convent. In fine, he pleaded her Cau&s;e with &s;uch dexterity, that the King granted his Reque&s;t, upon a pro|mi&s;e, that the Lady would be more cautious for the future. Then the Marquis of <HI>Vieuxburg</HI> be|gan to declare him&s;elf a Sui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">r to the fair Lady, tho' he could not well do it without a breach of Faith to Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Bulli,</HI> a Lady of Qua|lity, near <HI>Neuchatel</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> to whom he had given a Promi&s;e of Marriage. He was the Son of the Chancellor's Lady; and having lo&s;t his Elde&s;t Brother at the Siege of <HI>Namur,</HI> car|ried on by the Enemies, &s;ucceeded to his E&s;tate, which was not incon&s;iderable. The good Name he had in that Province, together with this Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, and a little Honour, if he had <HI>had</HI> any, ought to have deterr'd him from &s;o &s;candalous an Alliance: But this Lady having inchanted him, he open'd his mind to her; and by the di&s;covery of his De&s;ign, pleas'd her &s;o well, that &s;he offer'd to give him all &s;he had, provided he Married her. In effect, the bu&s;ine&s;s was kept private for &s;ome time; and in the mean time, the Chancellor's La|dy happening to die, both of them were &s;en&s;ible

The Chan|cellor, who had been kept ignorant of his Lady's illne&s;s for &s;ome days, and hinder'd from going to her Chamber, under the pretence of &s;ome preju|dice that might thereby accrue to either of their Healths: This Magi&s;trate, I &s;ay, gave his Lady a magnificent Funeral. In the mean time, he went and &s;pent &s;ome days with the Pre&s;ident <HI>Fourci,</HI> and after that return'd to his own Hou&s;e, and recom|menc'd the exerci&s;e of his Office, which has this privilege beyond all others, That tho&s;e who are inve&s;ted with it, never wear mourning, either for their Relations, or for the King him&s;elf. Mon|&s;ieur, and Mr. <HI>de Chartres,</HI> gave him a Vi&s;it to Solace him upon his Lo&s;s. The next day the Pope's Nuncio came to his Hou&s;e, and every body thought he had come upon the &s;ame Errand. But tho' the mea&s;ures of Civility requir'd that Com|pliment, e&s;pecially &s;ince he came to the Chancel|lor's own Hou&s;e; yet he made him another, that quickly di&s;cover'd the chief rea&s;on of his coming. However, it was not di&s;agreeable; for after having a&s;&s;ur'd him of the Pope's Re&s;pect for him, and his Family, He pre&s;ented to him a Brief from His Holine&s;s, permitting the &s;econd Son of Ma|dam <HI>Harlai,</HI> his Daughter, to po&s;&s;e&s;s all &s;orts of Abbeys, even tho&s;e mortgag'd to Regulars, tho' he was then but nine Years of Age. The rea&s;on that mov'd the Pope to this Di&s;pen&s;ation, was &s;et forth in the Brief. It imported, that his Holi|ne&s;s was infinitely glad to hear that Mr. <HI>Harlai</HI> was gone from <HI>France,</HI> upon a de&s;ign of making a ge|neral Peace; and that His Holine&s;s thought him|&s;elf oblig'd to te&s;tify this his Joy, by granting that favour to his Son. But after all, the Holy Father had not taken up this de&s;ire of giving Peace to Chri&s;tendom, till the King was expell'd <HI>Italy</HI>

<P>Count <HI>Mar&s;an,</HI> the Younge&s;t Brother of all the Princes of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> who married the Marchione&s;s of <HI>Siegnelay,</HI> after the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> broke off from her, got at that time a Pen&s;ion of Twenty thou&s;and Livers. This was matter of &s;urpri&s;al to every-body, not only by rea|&s;on of the &s;mall Service he had ever done to the State, but becau&s;e he had always a &s;orry Intere&s;t at Court.

When he married the Marchione&s;s of <HI>Albret,</HI> Widow to the Mar|quis of <HI>Albret, Mar&s;hal de Camp,</HI> who was kill'd when he went to &s;ee his Mi&s;tre&s;s; at that time, the King turn'd that Lady out of the Queen's Retinue; not that &s;he had done any thing de|&s;erving that di&s;grace; but only, becau&s;e &s;he had married a Man that the King did not like. The rea&s;on of the King's di&s;like, was grounded on his having &s;ome intrigue with a Young Prince, that His Maje&s;ty took care of, and his being charg'd with cajoling and wheedling a Young Prince&s;s, that he was equally concern'd for. But after all, he found ways and means to attone for all that; and upon that &s;core was oblig'd to his Lady, who has Friends of Intere&s;t and Credit. At pre&s;ent, he enjoys above fifty thou&s;and Crowns a Year, tho' before his fir&s;t marriage, he was not worth a Groat; and ju&s;t now he has bought one of the fine&s;t Hou&s;es in <HI>Paris.</HI> He had it from Pre&s;ident <HI>Tam|bonneau;</HI> and that Magi&s;trate bore &s;ome hard words from the fir&s;t Pre&s;ident, upon the account of &s;ome Difficulties relating to the execution of the

Bargain. That Hou&s;e had formerly a large Gar|den to it, part of which Mr. <HI>Tombonneau</HI> cut off, and joyn'd it to another Hou&s;e of his; and Count <HI>Mar&s;an</HI> alledg'd, That tho' that part was cut off by a particular clau&s;e, Calculated for that pur|po&s;e; yet at that time, it ought to be undone, becau&s;e it return'd naturally to the purcha&s;e to which it had always belong'd. They agreed to leave the matter to the Arbitration of the fir&s;t Pre|&s;ident. But whether this Magi&s;trate was partial, or thought it was ju&s;tice to give it again&s;t <HI>Tom|banneau,</HI> He deliver'd his mind in &s;uch har&s;h terms, as in&s;inuated, that he had over-reach'd Count <HI>Mar&s;an.</HI> 'Twas &s;ome time before Mr. <HI>Tam|bonneau</HI> would agree to his Verdict; but at la&s;t the matter was accommodated; and at this day, Count <HI>Mar&s;an</HI> lives in that fine Hou&s;e. Mr. <HI>Pont|chartrain</HI> had a mind for the Hou&s;e; but being a Man of a different &s;tamp from &s;ome Mini&s;ters, who do not grudge to give any price for what they like, he could not come up to Mr. <HI>Tomban|neau</HI>'s price. To be plain, when a Man throws away his money at &s;uch a rate, 'tis a &s;ign he comes ea&s;ily by it; whereas good Husbandry &s;peaks a fair purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s of <HI>Harcourt,</HI> who&s;e Husband is of the &s;ame Family with Count <HI>Mar&s;an,</HI> but not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ear &s;o Rich, lo&s;t at that time, a Law-Suit with Madam <HI>Nemours,</HI> which &s;he thought &s;he had been &s;ure of. 'Twas laid before the Council, and related to the Regi&s;ter of <HI>Lions,</HI> which &s;he ju&s;tly alledg'd to have been the property of her Grand-Fa|ther, by the Mother's-&s;ide. This her Grand-Father was the famous Farmer of the Revenue, call'd <HI>Garnier,</HI> who, tho' he was Born to very little, had got &s;uch a va&s;t E&s;tate, that he might have boa&s;ted of greater matters than <HI>Seba&s;tian Zamer</HI> did in former times; for whereas this Man en|titled him&s;elf, a Ma&s;ter of five hundred thou&s;and
<PB N="44" REF="197">
Crowns, the other might have pretended to &s;ix|teen millions. He was effectually po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of eight millions clear of the be&s;t money in the World, and the King owed him as much. But &s;oon after Mr. <HI>Fouquet</HI> was catch'd, the Court of Ju&s;tice came upon him, and there he was Taxed in proportion to what he had got, &s;o that his whole Fortune was melted in a moment. By good luck he had married a whole Regiment of Daughters very hand&s;omely; and having pay'd their Portions in ready money, Mr. <HI>Colbert,</HI> who rak'd into the very Branches of Families, could find no plea to &s;uck out the Blood, that they en|deavour'd to maintain their Honour with. The Prince&s;s of <HI>Harcourt</HI>'s Mother, who was married to Count <HI>Brancas,</HI> Gentleman of Honour to the Queen's Mother, had thus e&s;caped that Mini&s;ter's &s;crutiny, becau&s;e all her Portion was money paid down. However, her Daughter was of the &s;ame Humour with her Grand-Father, &s;o that it was not long of her, if &s;he was not Rich. She lo&s;t the above-mentioned Suit only by one Vote, which &s;he thought ought to have le&s;t oppos'd her. Hav|ing always been very careful in making intere&s;t with the Mini&s;ters, &s;he hop'd that Mr. <HI>Pontchar|train,</HI> who was one of the Judges, would favour her; But equity prevailing with hone&s;t Men, be|yond all other Con&s;iderations, he was one of tho&s;e that ca&s;t her. Tho' after all, when he was ask'd wherein Madam <HI>Nemours</HI>'s Cau&s;e had the advantage of hers, He reply'd, That he could not well tell; and that if he had thought the re&s;t would have been of his mind, he would have manag'd that Cau&s;e like the Oy&s;ter in <HI>Boileau</HI>'s Satyrs, in giving the two Shells to the two Prin|ce&s;&s;es, and the fle&s;hy part to the King, becau&s;e the property conte&s;ted by them, belong'd in effect only to His Maje&s;ty. The Prince&s;s of <HI>Harcourt,</HI> who will never lo&s;e any thing for want of a vi|gorous
<PB N="45" REF="198">
defence, does not yet give her Cau&s;e over for lo&s;t; and having &s;ometimes been lucky in Law-Suits, &s;he hopes to have the &s;ame good For|tune in this. But &s;ince her Fortune has been out of her Hands the&s;e twelve or fifteen Years, 'tis not probable that 'twill ever return to her. She made a &s;hift, by the intere&s;t of one of her Friends, to per&s;wade <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Gui&s;e,</HI> to give her Husband the Dukedom of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Gui&s;e-hou&s;e,</HI> which were worth at lea&s;t three millions. The procuring of this favour had co&s;t the Prince of <HI>Harcourt</HI> &s;ome Compliments and Addre&s;&s;es to his Benefactre&s;s: But his Humour being not &s;o pliable as his Lady's, he re-a&s;&s;um'd his Character, when he thought the bu&s;ine&s;s was done. Madam <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> complain'd of this to the Friend that had acted the part of a Mediator; and he being not able to per&s;wade the Prince to continue his Vi&s;its, &s;he re&s;um'd her Gift. This Thunder-&s;truck his Lady, who upon this Affair had di&s;play'd her ut|mo&s;t proue&s;s. However, &s;he is to be commended for managing &s;o wi&s;ely the Affairs of her Family, which her Husband neglects. He minds nothing but his Diver&s;ion, while &s;he &s;crapes up money to pay a Pen&s;ion, that &s;he's oblig'd to give him upon the con&s;ideration of his having turn'd over all his E&s;tate to her. But the Times we live in being &s;o unhappy, that little can be made of a Land-E|&s;tate, &s;he would find it very hard to do what &s;he does, if &s;he did not find ways of getting of &s;ome|thing from time to time. She neglects no oppor|tunity, &s;mall or great, it never &s;capes her, provided &s;he has any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>About that time, the Court was very hot upon the execution of a project, that had been propo&s;|ed by &s;everal Per&s;ons a long time before; I mean that of taking <HI>Carthagena,</HI> where the Banks of &s;everal Nations were lodg'd, as well as part of the Riches of <HI>Perou.</HI> In the beginning of the
<PB N="46" REF="199">
War, a <HI>Rochel-</HI>Man, call'd <HI>Petit,</HI> was taken up, who had gone to <HI>Holland,</HI> and there abjur'd his Religion, upon the per&s;wa&s;ion of his Wife; and after her Death had return'd to <HI>France.</HI> He was well vers'd in Sea-Affairs; and having been im|ploy'd by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> orders were given to take him Dead or Alive. Mr. <HI>Vilette,</HI> a Lieutenant-General at Sea, was imploy'd to execute the Or|ders; and, indeed, he once made up &s;o clo&s;e to him, that he thought to have given a good account of him: But <HI>Petit</HI> being on Board of a better Sai|ler, than any of the Lieutenant-General's Ships, he luckily got off; tho &s;ome time after, he de|liver'd him&s;elf into the Hands of the Governor of <HI>Vallenciennes,</HI> who gave notice of the &s;ame to the Court. In regard, he return'd with a re|&s;olution to re-a&s;&s;ume his wonted Religion and O|bedience, and had &s;poke &s;o to &s;ome People, who had acquainted the Mini&s;ters with it; they could not hand&s;omely indite him, but contented them|&s;elves with &s;ecuring his Per&s;on in the <HI>Ba&s;tille;</HI> that being thought nece&s;&s;ary, for that after &s;uch an e&s;cape as his, 'twas to be feared he might do the like again, if ever he fell into the Hands of &s;uch a Woman as his fir&s;t Wife was. His Im|pri&s;onment was a great &s;urprizal to him: How|ever, having time enough in Pri&s;on to think of his Concerns, he bethought him&s;elf, that he would never be &s;et at Liberty, unle&s;s he attoned for his Crime, by &s;ome great piece of Service. Having con&s;idered again and again of the mat|ter, and being well acquainted with the Coa&s;t where <HI>Carthagena</HI> lies; he lit upon the &s;ame Thought as others had before him. He was of Opinion, That 'twas not impo&s;&s;ible for the King to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of that place, and even of&mdash;which is yet Richer, and, as it were, the Magazine of all the Riches of <HI>Perou.</HI> Having hatch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d this Thought, his next bu&s;ine&s;s was to
<PB N="47" REF="200">
give it vent; for which end, he asked to &s;peak with Mr. <HI>Be&s;maux,</HI> Governor of the <HI>Ba&s;tille.</HI> But whether the Governor thought the Man was troubled with maggoty Fancies, or whether he had no mind to be him&s;elf an in&s;trument of lo&s;ing his Pri&s;oners, by who&s;e maintenance he got a great deal, and for that rea&s;on called them his Pigeons; Whatever was in it, he would not al|low him Paper to expre&s;s his Thoughts upon, but only promi&s;ed to &s;peak of his Project to a Mini|ni&s;ter of State. Tho' after all, 'tis very likely he did not that; for 'tis plain, that, if he had, Mr. <HI>Pontchartain,</HI> who had the management of Marine. Affairs, was too good a Servant of the King's, to neglect &s;uch a propo&s;al as that. The Pri&s;oner re|ceiving no An&s;wer, notwith&s;tanding the Gover|nor's Promi&s;e to bring him one; cut off the Mar|gins of a Book that he had, and having made &s;ome Ink of Soot or Charcoal, wrote down his Project, together with &s;everal other things, that then came into his Head. He had not well fini&s;h|ed his Scheme, when Mar&s;hal <HI>Tourville</HI> came to the <HI>Ba&s;tille</HI> to try &s;ome Cannon of a new inven|tion. The Cannon were fired into the Ditch, which the Pri&s;oner ob&s;erving through the Grates of the Chamber, threw out his Paquet well wrap|ed up. It fell at the Mar&s;hal's Feet, who have|ing time to read the Super&s;cription, <HI>viz. To Mar|&s;hal</HI> Tourville, <HI>upon Affairs of great con&s;equence relating to the Sea. This Pacquet to be delivered to Mr.</HI> Pontchartrain. Having read, I &s;ay, this Super&s;cription, he refufed to deliver it to Mr. <HI>Be&s;maux,</HI> who ask'd it of him. The Governor indeavour'd to per&s;wade him to it; by &s;etting forth, That a Mini&s;ter who&s;e time was &s;o preci|ous, ought not to be di&s;turb'd with idle Whims; that probably there was nothing in the Pacquet, but &s;uch Vapours as the damps of a Pri&s;on are apt to excite; and that for his part, he was teaz'd
<PB N="48" REF="201">
every day with &s;uch things, but that he never minded them. Mr. <HI>Tourville</HI> looking up to the Window where the Pacquet fell, ask'd him, who was in that Chamber? Mr. <HI>Be&s;maux</HI> made An|&s;wer, That 'twas a <HI>Rochel</HI> Renegado, without tel|ling his Name: But the Mar&s;hal knowing that <HI>Petit</HI> was Pri&s;oner in the Ca&s;tle, and taking that to be his Apartment, told the Governor, that &s;ince the Pacquet came from &s;o good a place, he was ob|liged to give it to Mr. <HI>Pontchartrain.</HI> Accordingly he gave it to him; and that Mini&s;ter having pe|rus'd it, found &s;ome things in it better explain'd than in the other Memorials that had formerly been given in upon that Subject. Then he let the matter &s;leep for a while, in order to dige&s;t things more maturely; and at la&s;t &s;poke of it in private to &s;ome Sea-Officers, that he thought ca|pable to re&s;olve &s;ome Doubts he had upon that Head. Some of them repre&s;ented it as impo&s;|&s;ible; and others as a very dangerous enterprize; only Mr. <HI>Pointis</HI> &s;poke of it as an ea&s;y thing, be|cau&s;e he wanted to be imploy'd in the Expedition. One mu&s;t be prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with an expectation of &s;ucce&s;s in any Enterprize, in order to go through with it. Accordingly, in &s;everal Conferences be|tween that Mini&s;ter, and <HI>Pointis,</HI> the latter ap|pear'd &s;till more and more forward, and remov|ed &s;everal Difficulties, that the other look'd up|on as very con&s;iderable: So great an itch had <HI>Pointis</HI> to &s;ignalize him&s;elf in that Expedition. But <HI>Glory</HI> was not the only motive in his view; he had another that weigh'd as much with him, tho' it was not altogether &s;o Honourable. He was in Love with Pre&s;ident <HI>Ferrand's</HI> Daughter, and neither of them having any E&s;tate, in the ardour of his Pa&s;&s;ion to enjoy her, he thought no Wall what&s;oever would &s;tand before him. Mr. <HI>Pontchartrain</HI> perceiving that he was the Man he wanted, and that he could never find another
<PB N="49" REF="202">
that would carry on the Enterprize with &s;o much heat: Upon this con&s;ideration, I &s;ay, he gave him a Promi&s;e of being imploy'd upon that De&s;ign. <HI>Pointis</HI> recounted the Affair to his Mi|&s;tre&s;s, and among many other &s;weet words told her, That &s;he &s;hould have the Triumph of that Place; that for his part, all his Ambition was, to lay at her Feet, all the Riches that the Expedition &s;hould afford; and that he accounted him&s;elf but too happy, if by that means he could procure her favour. While he was thus taken up in Court|&s;hip, Mr. <HI>Ponchartrain</HI> went effectually about the bu&s;ine&s;s. There being a nece&s;&s;ity of an infinite &s;um of money, to an&s;wer the Charge that His M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">je&s;ty was at upon other accounts: He had a mind that this Expedition &s;hould co&s;t the King nothing. With this view, by the King's permi&s;|&s;ion, he erected a Company, which advanc'd the money for carrying on the Expedition, upon Con|dition of receiving the Profits that &s;hould accrue by it; &s;ome put in a thou&s;and Pi&s;tols, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s; the Fleet was got ready, and Mr. <HI>Pointis</HI> put to Sea, when no body knew where he was going. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> thought he had a de|&s;ign upon their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in <HI>Carolina,</HI> and gave the nece&s;&s;ary Orders to prevent it. The <HI>Dutch</HI> were apprehen&s;ive of a de&s;ign upon them. How|ever, Mr. <HI>Pontis</HI> fell in upon <HI>Carthagena,</HI> all on a &s;udden, when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> lea&s;t expected it, and Landed there &s;ome Soldiers that he had brought with him. At the &s;ame time, the Governor of St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> being acquainted with the De&s;ign, brought &s;ome Buckaneers to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Siege. <HI>Pointis</HI> &s;tood much in need of them, and without them he had never compa&s;s'd his end. But they were &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied upon the &s;mall &s;hare they had of the Booty, that they fir&s;t complain'd to him, and then threaten'd openly to &s;end &s;ome body to Court, to demand ju&s;tice of him. He laugh'd, both at
<PB N="50" REF="203">
their Complaints and Threats, fancying, that his &s;ucce&s;s would procure him a hearing to their pre|judice. There was an immen&s;e quantity of Riches in that City, both in Bars of Silver, Gold-du&s;t, and pretious Stones: And he did not neglect his own Coffers, no more than &s;ome Captains of Ships, who&s;e Avarice was more notorious than his own: For on Board of one of them, there was found Effects, to the value of eighty thou&s;and Crowns; he having converted the money into Goods, which he was afterwards oblig'd to convert into money again. Others were likewi&s;e convicted of having endeavour'd to enrich them&s;elves upon the Com|pany's Charges, while it was only &s;u&s;pected. But &s;ince Malice and Calumny is very forward, e|&s;pecially upon &s;uch things, for which every Man is believed to have a good Appetite; 'twould not be ju&s;t to be po&s;itive in the Accu&s;ation. In that City, there was a Young Man, who was the Son of the Governor of <HI>Lima;</HI> and, by his Folly, had a mind to furni&s;h tho&s;e who vented Romances, with Truths in&s;tead of their ordinary Fables. He was &s;eiz'd with a Pa&s;&s;ion of Love for the Prin|ce&s;s of <HI>Conti,</HI> the King's Daughter, upon &s;eeing her Picture, which fell accidentally into his Hands, by an Engagement with the <HI>Buccaneers:</HI> He found it in the Arms of one that was Kill'd, and pre&s;ently took it into his own, as being a Trea|&s;ure that he e&s;teem'd more than the Pearls and Diamonds he had found among the Spoil. Ne|ver were &s;uch Follies committed, as that young Fool was guilty of, after the &s;ight of that Pi|cture; every day he ki&s;&s;ed it a thou&s;and times, and he never ingaged, without invoking it before hand, as the only Deity that could a&s;&s;i&s;t him. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> good Fortune he had, he imputed it all to it, which enlarged his e&s;teem of it more and more. But at la&s;t being over-power'd in an En|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gement with a King, in the Neighbourhood of
<PB N="51" REF="204">
his Father's Government; the King, as barbarous as he was, lov'd the Picture as pa&s;&s;ionately as he, As &s;oon as he ca&s;t his Eyes upon it, he ask'd. What Picture it was, and would have &s;natch'd it from him: Upon that, he threw him&s;elf at the King's Feet, conjuring him to take his Life, be|fore he robb'd him of his Picture. The Conqueror &s;eeing him in &s;o humble a Po&s;ture, took pity of him, and offer'd to let him keep his Picture, pro|vided he gave him to know the Original. The Young Gentleman reply'd, That he could not &s;a|tisfie him upon that point, becau&s;e he did not know him&s;elf who&s;e it was: And with the &s;ame Breath, acquainted him how it came into his Hands, and offer'd to get it Copy'd. The Prince was &s;o much taken with the Beauty of the Pi|cture, that he caus'd &s;everal Copies to be drawn from it: The&s;e he order'd to be hung up in the Temples of his fal&s;e Gods, in order to adore the Original, which he thought could not be &s;o pret|ty, unle&s;s &s;he were Divine. The Young Gentle|man having thus &s;av'd his Picture, was afraid of lo&s;ing it at <HI>Carthagena,</HI> when Mr. <HI>Pointis</HI> took it; Fancying, that all the World were as great Fools as he, and the Prince that made an Idol of it. The fir&s;t Compliment he made to Mr. <HI>Poin|tis,</HI> was, That by the right of Conque&s;t, he was Ma&s;ter of all that he had; but as for that Pi|cture, he would part with it and his Life at the &s;ame time. Mr. <HI>Pointis</HI> was &s;o much dazzl'd with the pro&s;pect of the Riches that lay before him, that he had forgot every thing, and even Madam <HI>Ferrand;</HI> and thus having other things in view than the Picture, he gave him to know, that he might be ea&s;ie, and what Pictures he had a mind for, were tho&s;e of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and other Princes, engrav'd upon Gold; and as for the Pictures of Women, he would quit them for a trifle, 'provided they were only valuable
<PB N="52" REF="205">
for their Beauty, or good Painting. This Pro|mi&s;e put the Young Gentleman in good Heart: And Mr. <HI>Pointis</HI> having cloy'd him&s;elf with the Plunder of the Town, had the curio&s;ity to look upon the Thing that occa&s;ioned the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s Sighs: for he gave deep Sighs every minute, which made people believe, that he was a very p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters">on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">te Lov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r.

But Mr. <HI>Montchevreuil</HI>'s Indi&s;cretion, in &s;pending at <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> much more than his Incomes could afford, quickly di&s;covered the Intrigue: His Father allowed him nothing; and all he had was a Pen&s;ion of one thou&s;and Livers, and his E|quipage. Upon this, Intendant <HI>Begnon</HI> &s;melling the matter, gave notice of it to the Court. His Intere&s;t at Court might have prevented his Ar|re&s;t, if Mr. <HI>Begnon</HI>'s Intelligence had not been put out of all doubt, by his imprudence, in &s;et|ting out his very Foot-men with the be&s;t Mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ins he had taken in that Ship. <HI>Bene,</HI> indeed, acted more prudently; and it was not long of him that the thing took Air: But Mr. <HI>Montchevreuil</HI>'s im|prudence carried it &s;o far, that they were both taken up. <HI>Bene,</HI> who had not &s;o much Intere&s;t as the other, could not get off, notwith&s;tanding the Wi&s;dom of his Conduct. <HI>Begnon</HI> wrote him a thundring Note, concluding in the&s;e few words, <HI>You are happy in having Mr.</HI> Montchevreuil <HI>for a Partner in your Robbery; A&s;&s;ure your &s;elf, that if you were by your &s;elf, I would have ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d you to be Hang'd in forty eight Hours.</HI> At the Mari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">es interceeded on his behalf, becau&s;e he was a good Officer; but fora&s;much as the one could
<PB N="54" REF="207">
not be indited without the other, they were both clear'd after five or &s;ix months Impri&s;onment. But after all, if all the Thieves had been Hang|ed, <HI>Bene</HI> had got more Company than Mr. <HI>Mont|chevreuil:</HI> For at the Sale of the&s;e Prizes, which amounted in Gro&s;s to 2500000 Livres, a great many things were tran&s;acted, that were not very fair. Tho&s;e who had a mind to 'em, gave a large Pre&s;ent to the per&s;ons that were empower|ed to adjudge 'em, to prevent their being &s;old by Retail, pur&s;uant to the de&s;ire of tho&s;e who were intere&s;s'd in the matter. But whatever the Pre&s;ent was, they lo&s;t nothing by it; for at <HI>Nants</HI> they &s;old the Goods by Retail, at three Millions profit.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris</HI> im|ploy'd his utmo&s;t endeavours, to make good the Character the King had procur'd him, by giving him that rich Benefice. Tho' his Brother's For|tune might have done &s;omething for him, yet he did not owe his Preferment to that, but only to his own Merit. While he was Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cha|lons,</HI> a See that he had before his acce&s;&s;ion to that of <HI>Paris,</HI> he always acted up to the Office of a Holy Prelate. To continue the &s;ame cour&s;e of Piety that he had always follow'd, he made Head a|gain&s;t Vice: And accordingly one of his fir&s;t Edicts, after his acce&s;&s;ion to the la&s;t See, was levell'd again&s;t the Ma&s;querades; an Abu&s;e, that in earne&s;t ought not to be &s;uffer'd among Chri&s;tians. What a &s;trange preparation is the Commi&s;&s;ion of a thou|&s;and lewd and fooli&s;h Actions, for the Repent|ance that ought to be Preach'd up in <HI>Lent!</HI> The Emperor extirpated this di&s;order at <HI>Vienna,</HI> under the &s;ole pretext of the War with the <HI>Turks.</HI> Nobody was there allow'd to di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves; and even School-Boys were not allow'd to do it with impunity. However, the Archbi&s;hop not u&s;ing the &s;ame pretence to &s;ink that di&s;order at
<PB N="55" REF="208">
<HI>Paris,</HI> but that of the Love and Gratitude we owe to God, for &s;hedding his Blood for us upon the Cro&s;s, had not the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s as the Empe|ror had at <HI>Vienna.</HI> If he had had recour&s;e to the King, for the putting his Edict in execution, per|haps the fear of di&s;plea&s;ing that Monarch would have gone farther, than the fear of God. But whether it was, that he did not &s;peak of it to the King, or that the King had &s;ome Rea&s;ons of State for not minding him; there was as many Ma&s;querades that Year, as if there had never been an Order again&s;t 'em. The Archbi&s;hop finding he could not compa&s;s his de&s;ign, bent his Thoughts upon another Di&s;order, that wanted as much to be remedy'd; I mean the Debauchery of Women: that was got to &s;uch a height, that no Language can reach. There was always two Convents at <HI>Paris,</HI> for &s;hutting up the&s;e Wretches; and two Societies have been &s;ince Erected, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, by the Care and Charity of &s;ome Ver|tuous Ladies. In the&s;e Societies, they are far from being u&s;ed &s;o &s;everely, as at the <HI>Magdalon|nettes,</HI> and <HI>Filles Repent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> where the Whips are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o far from freeing a So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l from Vice, that, on the contrary, they make 'em regret, that they cannot continue their pa&s;t cour&s;e of Life. We mu&s;t not pretend to tran&s;late a Per&s;on all on a &s;udden, from Vice to Vertue, e&s;pecially by Cor|rection; for that ought to be effected by degrees, and rather by Per&s;wa&s;ion, than by Force. This gentle method was u&s;ed in the&s;e two Societies; one of which is call'd St. <HI>I&s;idore,</HI> and the other <HI>Bon Po&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ur.</HI> The latter had this peculiar Cu&s;tom, that they forc'd none to come among 'em. All the Actions of that Hou&s;e, were an&s;werable to its Title. The Girls that repented of their Lewdne&s;s, or were afraid of falling into it, came thither of their own accord, and were entertain'd there as long as they pleas'd; and their <HI>Governantes</HI> ei|ther
<PB N="56" REF="209">
procur'd 'em &s;ome Place in a Per&s;on of Qua|lity's Hou&s;e, if they were fit for Service, or got 'em Husbands, if they lik'd that better. When they de&s;ired to be gone, they were &s;uffered to go, tho' 'twas to be fear'd, they might return to their Vomit. This Society, and this Cu&s;tom is &s;till kept up; and all pious Per&s;ons, of what Condi|tion &s;oever, not only vi&s;it the&s;e lo&s;t Sheep, that are thus return'd to their Flock, but likewi&s;e Eat with 'em very often. This they take to be a more effectual method, as indeed it is, to reclaim them, than that of letting Dogs loo&s;e upon 'em. And 'tis for this rea&s;on that the Hou&s;e is entitl'd <HI>Bon Pa&s;teur, The good Shepherd;</HI> for the <HI>Good Shep|herd,</HI> who, properly &s;peaking, is the Son of God, did not &s;cruple to eat with <HI>Publicans.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Daughters of St. <HI>I&s;idore,</HI> they were not u&s;ed &s;o very gently, as tho&s;e of the <HI>Bon Pa&s;teur;</HI> but kept a &s;ort of a Medium between the&s;e and the <HI>Magdalonnettes.</HI> The Archbi&s;hop, who&s;e Province it is to take Cogni&s;ance of all that pa&s;&s;es in that &s;ort of Hou&s;es, knowing that the&s;e liv'd under a Director, who&s;e Doctrine he &s;u&s;pected, would have taken them from him. But they &s;tood by him with &s;ome warmth; and the more they &s;hew'd their zeal to keep him, the more the Archbi&s;hop pre&s;&s;ed to put another in his place. At la&s;t, they told him freely, That if he put in another, they would not receive him, and that they would ra|ther di&s;per&s;e than comply with it. Now they had liberty to di&s;per&s;e, for they were not &s;ettled there, either by the King's Letter, or an Order from the Court of Ju&s;tice. Accordingly, perceiv|ing that the Archbi&s;hop was immoveable, and fully re&s;olv'd to &s;ubject them to his Obedience, they actually di&s;pers'd; for which the Archbi&s;hop was blam'd by a great many, e&s;pecially by tho&s;e who were not acquainted with the rea&s;on, that had oblig'd him to do as he did.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="210">
At that time, Mr. <HI>Verthamont de Villemont</HI> dyed, who was the only Man that perhaps made the King depart from his wonted Moderation. He was Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts; and making u&s;e of the Authority he had among the Gown-men, both by his Place, and by the numerou&s;ne&s;s of his Rela|tions and Friends, did what he could to Ruine a Gentleman of the Name of <HI>Servon,</HI> that had been his Neighbour in the Country. <HI>Servon</HI> being Re|lated to Mr. <HI>Perefixe,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> had recour&s;e to him, who engag'd to protect him, af|ter he found that Magi&s;trate &s;o proud of his Intere&s;t, that he openly contemn'd both his Friend and him. <HI>Verthamont</HI> finding that the Archbi&s;hop had declar'd again&s;t him, and that he had imbark'd in that Cau&s;e for the &s;ake of &s;ome Intere&s;t of his own, form'd a de&s;ign again&s;t his Life, and alledg'd, that he had a Love int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">gue upon that &s;ide. On the other hand, the Archbi&s;hop form'd a de&s;ign again&s;t his Life. Thus th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> rais'd between 'em the greate&s;t Suit that had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">en &s;een for a long time; and the Cau&s;e being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ought before the Council, the King him&s;elf a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters">d at the Deci&s;ion; which Mr. <HI>Villemont,</HI> who knew his Integrity and Ju&s;tice, was not pleas'd with. The Archbi&s;hop being &s;en&s;ible that his Honour was very much touch'd by the Accu&s;ation prefer'd again&s;t him by that Magi&s;trate; and that 'twas not enough for him to maintain, that it was an Impo&s;ture, as it was, but to prove it to be &s;uch; upon this view I &s;ay, he de&s;ir'd him to conde&s;cend to the Circum|&s;tances of the Fact, in order to his Conviction. Accordingly <HI>Verthamont</HI> advanc'd, That on &s;uch a Day, at &s;uch an Hour, in &s;uch a Year, and at &s;uch a Place, he had an interview with a certain Lady, whom it was well known he had formerly vi&s;ited with &s;ome &s;ort of Familiarity. Now, Mr. <HI>Perefixe</HI> was at that time at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> of which he was Bi&s;hop before his Acce&s;&s;ion to the See of
<PB N="58" REF="211">
<HI>Paris;</HI> and for fear <HI>Verthamont</HI> &s;hould retract and throw his mi&s;take upon the weakne&s;s of his Me|mory; he pretended at fir&s;t to make but weak Defences, in order to make the other maintain his Forgery with more Impudence. This <HI>Verthamont</HI> did not fail to do; for fancying that the whole Court was on his &s;ide, the An&s;wers being &s;o fri|volous, he in&s;i&s;ted on the Charge, becau&s;e the Archbi&s;hop had &s;ummon'd him to declare, whe|ther he adher'd to his Accu&s;ation, or not. He likewi&s;e conde&s;cended to a great many particu|lars of matter of Fact, which &s;eem'd probable. The Archbi&s;hop finding him engag'd &s;o far, that he could not afterwards retract, de&s;ir'd to be allow'd to prove him&s;elf <HI>Alibi.</HI> This was the be&s;t method he could take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o ju&s;tifie his Innocence, and retort the Calumny upon his Adver&s;ary. The Court could not refu&s;e to hear his Proof; &s;o, he prov'd, not only by Witne&s;&s;es, but likewi&s;e by an Order he made, as Bi&s;hop that day, which was Publi&s;h'd throughout his Dioce&s;s; he prov|ed, I &s;ay, that he was above one hundred and fif|ty Leagues off from the place of the alledg'd In|terview. <HI>Verthamont</HI> was &s;trangely &s;urpris'd, when he &s;aw him&s;elf thus Convicted. However, as all Litigious Men have &s;ome back Door or o|ther, he alledg'd, That, indeed, he was out as to the Year; but as to the Fact it &s;elf, and the Day, he was certainly in the right: But after what was pa&s;t, that Rea&s;on would not bear: So that he was not only order'd to make reparation of the Prelat's Honour; but he, and his Po&s;terity, were declar'd uncapable for ever of enjoying any Magi&s;tracy. The Sentence contain'd likewi&s;e o+ther Puni&s;hments again&s;t him, which 'twere too tedious to in&s;ert here. However, fancying the King would be &s;o good as to di&s;pen&s;e with part of 'em, he had the boldne&s;s to appear at the King's Levee &s;ome days after. The King was
<PB N="59" REF="212">
incens'd when he &s;aw him, and commanded him, in har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">h words, to depart his Chamber. <HI>Vertha|mont</HI> obey'd, without &s;taying for a &s;econd Order; and was even oblig'd to retire to the Country, for the King would not allow him &s;o much as to continue at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The Plenipotentiaries continued &s;till at <HI>Re&s;wick,</HI> and it being uncertain whether the Peace would be concluded or not, new Edicts were i&s;&s;ued forth. One of 'em oblig'd the great Cities and Towns of the Provinces, to take Lanthorns, like tho&s;e at <HI>Paris;</HI> and to buy them&s;elves off by a Tax to be laid upon the twentieth Penny. By that Edict the King promis'd, in con&s;ideration of that Tax, to be at the charge of the Lights for ever. In fine, 'twas vi&s;ible, that this was only a new in|vention for rai&s;ing of Money, which was much wanted at that time. Mr. <HI>Caumartin,</HI> Intendant to the Finances, was order'd to carry the Edict to the fir&s;t Pre&s;ident, in order to have it con|vey'd to the Attorney-General, who read it with the colde&s;t Humour of any Man in the World. Mr. <HI>Caumartin</HI> expected, that when he had read it, he would give him his Sentiments of the matter, which he meant to Communicate to the Mini&s;ter of State. But the Magi&s;trate continuing &s;ilent for &s;ome time, he turn'd the Edict over, and put it &s;everal times into the Hands of the Magi&s;trate, who &s;till return'd it: At la&s;t, being tired with &s;huffling it to and again, he broke &s;ilence, and &s;aid, It was a fine Edict, and that he and his Friends ought to be convinc'd that it was &s;uch. At lea&s;t, &s;aid he, for my particular &s;atisfaction, I expect|ed you would have done me the honour to tell me, in who&s;e Head all the&s;e Lanthorns were fir&s;t projected. Upon this Expre&s;&s;ion Mr. <HI>Caumartin</HI> could not refrain from Laughing, and imparted the occa&s;ion of Laughter to his Friends. After all, the Ca&s;e was laid before the Parliament,
<PB N="60" REF="213">
and no one had the &s;ame curio&s;ity as this Magi|&s;trate had.</P>
<P>The Conferences at <HI>Re&s;wick</HI> did not divert the King from &s;ending pui&s;&s;ant Armies into the Field. By vertue of the Peace of <HI>Savoy,</HI> he was Superior in force to his Enemies; and part of his Troops that had &s;erv'd in <HI>Italy,</HI> he had tran&s;ported to <HI>Catalonia.</HI> In this Province he was &s;till Ma&s;ter of the Cities of <HI>Ro&s;es</HI> and <HI>Gironne,</HI> with &s;ome other Places of importance; and had a free ac|ce&s;s to <HI>Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">lona,</HI> which is the Metrapolitan of that Country, and, in a manner, the Barrier of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy. This City, which is Rich, Great, well Peopled, and the ordinary Re&s;idence of the Nobility of that Country, is &s;ituated on the Mediterranean, and has a very con&s;iderable port upon that &s;ide. The oppo&s;ition that the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> had hitherto made to the Peace, mov'd the King to Be&s;iege it: He thought, that if he could take it, he could at lea&s;t, bring the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Branch to rea&s;onable terms, con&s;idering, that after that, even <HI>Madrid</HI> it&s;elf was not &s;ecure. His Maje&s;ty wrote his Thoughts of this matter to Mr. <HI>Vendome,</HI> who commanded the Troops in that Country. This General &s;ent him word, that the Troops he had there were not &s;ufficient for &s;o great an Enterprize; and that it could not be compa&s;&s;ed with le&s;s than fifty Thou&s;and Men. Now at that time he had &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">arce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">wenty five Thou&s;and. But His Maje&s;ty having ten Thou&s;and more ready upon a Call, comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nded him to make prepara|tions for the De&s;ign, and promis'd to &s;end 'em to him when he wanted 'em. After &s;uch po&s;itive Orders, Mr. <HI>Vendome</HI> had nothing el&s;e to do, but to concert all mea&s;ures for &s;atisfying the King. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> having already taken the Ala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m at the lo&s;s of their other Places in that Province, and perceiving that the King meant to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of that Place, &s;ent their be&s;t Troops
<PB N="61" REF="214">
thither. The Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> being the Empre&s;es's Si&s;ter, de&s;ir'd the Emperor to &s;end &s;ome Regiments under the pretence of pre&s;erving that Province. But that was not her main De&s;ign: She had a greater eye upon the intere&s;t of Arch-Duke <HI>Charles,</HI> her Nephew; for her Husband having no I&s;&s;ue, and being not very healthy, &s;he had a mind to &s;e|cure to him the Crown that <HI>Philip</HI> IV. had be|queath'd him by his Will. Pur&s;uant to this de|&s;ign, &s;he had brought &s;ome <HI>Germans</HI> into the Council, in order to &s;tifle the Artifices, that <HI>France,</HI> and even &s;ome <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Grandees might &s;et on foot, either for the intere&s;t of that Crown, or for their own; for there were &s;ome of 'em that laid claim to the Blood of the Ancient Kings of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tile,</HI> and others to that of the Kings of <HI>Arragon.</HI> The&s;e <HI>German</HI> Coun&s;ellors acted in concert with her; and the Emperor &s;ent 'em In&s;tructions, to the end that nothing might be concerted contrary to his Intere&s;t, or that of the Arch-Duke, his Son. In the mean time, His Imperial Maje&s;ty &s;ent the Troops that were de&s;ired; and it being much his Intere&s;t not to lo&s;e <HI>Barcelona,</HI> he intreated the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> to &s;end a Fleet into the <HI>Medi|terranean.</HI> He was very &s;en&s;ible what was like|ly to happen, becau&s;e the King made new pre|parations in <HI>Provence,</HI> and &s;eem'd to have nothing &s;o much in view as the Conque&s;t of that Place. However, his Intreaty did not come &s;o very &s;ea|&s;onably; whether it was, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> had occa&s;ion to employ their Ships el&s;e|where, or, which is very probable, that they thought the taking of that Place would &s;o humble the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> that they would not oppo&s;e the Peace any longer; for they did not much trouble their Heads upon the matter.</P>
<P>While preparations for War were made, not only in that Country, but in all the other &s;eats of War; a new War broke out in the Church,
<PB N="62" REF="215">
which might have caus'd great di&s;orders, if it had not been quickly &s;tifled; indeed it might have been &s;ooner &s;tifled, if the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> had not been very complai&s;ant to a certain Gentleman that I &s;hall call by his Name by and by, by which means it took deeper Root than it might have done. To under&s;tand this matter throughly, 'twill not be improper to carry our account of things a little higher. In the Popedom of <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. a Prie&s;t call'd <HI>Molinos,</HI> &s;tarted up at <HI>Rome,</HI> who taught very uncommon Doctrines, and did not want followers. Among many erroneous Doctrines, this was the greate&s;t, That when the Soul came once to a certain point of Sanctity, it was not capable of &s;inning, and then it had no part or concern in the Actions of the Body. 'Tis a &s;tanding Maxim, that we ought not to cen&s;ure a Man's in|tentions, e&s;pecially when his Morals are uncul|pable as to outward appearance; and for that rea&s;on I &s;hall be very cautious of &s;aying, that this new Sectary, under the pretence of &s;o great Purity, conceal'd a great many Di&s;orders that his Enemies have fal&s;ly charg'd upon him. Perhaps he meant, that the Soul cannot controul &s;ome Infirmities that we are &s;ubject to from our Mo|ther's Womb: And provided the&s;e are dete&s;ted by her, &s;he is not accountable for 'em before God. Were it &s;o, nothing could be objected again&s;t his Doctrine, for &s;uch is the Doctrine of the Church; and what St. <HI>Paul</HI> teaches us, who was continually tempted notwith&s;tanding his being one of the greate&s;t Saints in Paradi&s;e. However, &s;ince a great many uncouth Con&s;equences might be drawn from his way of explaining him&s;elf, both upon this Article, and many others, the whole Church ro&s;e up again&s;t him. <HI>Rome,</HI> in who&s;e view the thing happen'd, Arre&s;ted him; and his Ca&s;e being brought before the Inqui&s;ition, he was there Con|demned
<PB N="63" REF="216">
by &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ioners as were appointed. He &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to their Cen&s;ure, and &s;ome Years after died in Pri&s;on: Upon which 'twas ge|nerally thought, that this new Here&s;ie, known by the name of <HI>Quieti&s;m,</HI> was &s;o far from pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Alps,</HI> that it died outright with him. But the Ca&s;e was quite otherwi&s;e: For not only <HI>Italy</HI> was &s;tuffed with his Errours, but even <HI>France</HI> it&s;elf was tainted with them. One Madam <HI>Guy|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a,</HI> the Widow of Mr. <HI>Montargis,</HI> who, after the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tting of a great E&s;tate upon the Canal of <HI>Bria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> left her with two Children: This Lady, I &s;ay, minded nothing le&s;s than the true Educa|tion of her Children: Not that &s;he wanted either Wit or Judgment; nay, on the contrary, &s;he had a greater &s;hare of both than what is natural to Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">en, or what her&s;elf ought to have de&s;ired: For &s;he meddled with what did not become her, and &s;hoving her No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e into Books, pretended to explain not only the Fathers but even the Scripture it &s;elf. In fine, having heard of <HI>Molinos</HI> and his Herefie, &s;he could not be ea&s;ie till &s;he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Copy of his Books, and canva&s;s'd 'em all over.

She di&s;pers'd her Books among the Convents, and &s;everal other places; and the Ab|bot
<PB N="64" REF="217">
of <HI>Fenelon,</HI> the Gentleman who&s;e Name I pro|mi&s;ed not to forget, finding them of a piece with his Sentiments, approv'd 'em &s;ecretly. This he dur&s;t not do publickly, by rea&s;on that he was made <HI>Sub-praeceptor</HI> to the Children of the Royal Family; and that the di&s;covery of this his Appro|bation, would not only cut off his arrival at a Bi&s;hoprick, but di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him of the Po&s;t he was then in. However, Madam <HI>Guyon</HI>'s Writings being publi&s;h'd, began to make a noi&s;e in the World; and in regard that the advances contain'd in 'em, incourag'd all the periods of a di&s;&s;olute Life, or at lea&s;t, made way for very odd con&s;equences; upon this Con&s;ideration, I &s;ay, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> as well as the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who was then only Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chalons,</HI> undertook to make her &s;en&s;ible of her Error. They had Conferences upon this Head with the Abbot of <HI>Fenelon,</HI> whom they deem'd to be tainted with the &s;ame Doctrine. He, on the other hand ju&s;tify'd her A&s;&s;ertions; and maintain'd, that her Thoughts were Ju&s;t and Or|thodox, tho' the Meaning and Explication that they forc'd upon her, was Heretical. He likewi&s;e &s;poke up for her Morals, and the Conduct of her Life, which he pretended to be particularly ac|quainted with, tho' both the one and the other were much &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>The warmth he &s;hew'd in ju&s;tifying her, con|firm'd the two Prelates in the Thought, That the Doctrine he vindicated, was as much his own, as hers. They told him as much, and he on the other hand did not deny it; but had the &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to a&s;&s;ure 'em, That he would willingly change his Mind, if he were convinced of the Error. To this purpo&s;e, an A&s;&s;embly was held at <HI>I&s;&s;i;</HI> but before they met, Madam <HI>Guyon</HI> had given in to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> a Copy of all her Writings, in order to be examin'd at his lei&s;ure. The Bi|&s;hop examin'd it with all po&s;&s;ible Care; and like|wi&s;e
<PB N="65" REF="218">
was at the pains of in&s;pecting the Conduct of her Life for &s;ome time, by which means he di&s;cover'd that &s;he inflamed the Evil, by pretend|ing to Authorize her Doctrine by Miracles, and a Gift of Prophecy, be&s;tow'd upon her by God. She recounted Stories to this effect, pretending to confirm 'em by credible Witne&s;&s;es; and in a word, never did Woman, or Man, carry Fanati|ci&s;m &s;o far as &s;he did. In fine, there was cau&s;e enough for putting her up in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> if it had not been for tho&s;e who &s;upported her. All the Ab|bot of <HI>Fenelon</HI>'s Friends were hers; the Duke of <HI>Beauvillers,</HI> Governor to the Princes of the Royal Family, was &s;u&s;pected to be an Abettor of her Errors, as well as the Duke of <HI>Chevreu&s;e,</HI> and their whole Families. The thing that confirm'd the general &s;u&s;picion of the Duke <HI>de Beauvillers</HI> beyond the re&s;t, was the putting his eight Daugh|ters into a Convent at <HI>Montargis.</HI> 'Twas con|cluded from thence, that <HI>Montargis</HI> being the place where this Here&s;ie was fir&s;t hatched in <HI>France,</HI> that Convent being a Convent of <HI>Benedictines,</HI> was likewi&s;e tainted. The whole Family of <HI>Charo&s;t</HI> was &s;u&s;pected in like manner of falling in with this Here&s;ie. But that which re&s;train'd &s;crupu|lous and nice Con&s;ciences from Condemning it, at a time when they were very &s;en&s;ible of its perni|cious Con&s;equences, was, That neither the Court, nor <HI>France</HI> it&s;elf, could boa&s;t of Per&s;ons of &s;uch Chri&s;tian Lives, and Regular Morals, as all the Favourers of the new Doctrine were of. Their Piety was not of &s;o late a date, as the Here&s;ie of <HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> that Madam <HI>Guyon</HI> Reviv'd: From their fir&s;t appearance at Court, they were all eminent for Vertue; and 'twas in con&s;ideration of that, that the King cho&s;e to put the Children of <HI>France</HI> under the Government of the Duke of <HI>Beauvil|lers.</HI> He had been thirty Years a Courtier; and during that &s;pace of time, had never counter acted
<PB N="66" REF="219">
the Mea&s;ures of Vertue, which &s;hin'd in all his Actions; and in a word, no Man could be in grea|ter e&s;teem at Court, than him&s;elf. So that, when the Publick &s;aw him charg'd with the Abetting of this new Doctrine, they look'd upon the Charge as Invidious, as well as Zealous. They put this con&s;truction upon the matter, that the Po&s;t he was in, created him private Enemies, who wanted to &s;ucceed him, and &s;tood at nothing to compa&s;s their End.</P>
<P>Whatever was in it, the Abbot of <HI>Fenelon,</HI> who always &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition to obey what Deci|&s;ion &s;hould be made at <HI>I&s;&s;i,</HI> joyned with Madam <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">yon</HI> in &s;ingling out a third Per&s;on, who would ca&s;t the Ballance upon the &s;ide he declared for, if the two Bi&s;hops who were to meet &s;hould be of a contrary Sentiment. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> pre|tends, in a Book he has lately publi&s;hed, That all this was carried on, without the King's know|ing any thing of the matter. This I am willing to believe, becau&s;e he &s;aid it. And I likewi&s;e be|lieve, that the rea&s;on in his view, was, to pre|vent the King's having an ill opinion of the Ab|bot of <HI>Fenelon;</HI> His Maje&s;ty being an Enemy to all new Opinions, not only out of Piety, but out of Policy; &s;ince nothing is more apt to di&s;turb the Repo&s;e of a State, than Innovations in Reli|gious Matters. The third Per&s;on I mention'd but now, was Mr. <HI>Tron&s;on,</HI> Doctor of the <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> Superior of the Seminary of S. <HI>Sulpitius,</HI> a Man of &s;ound Principles, and one who&s;e Life and Con|ver&s;ation were blamele&s;s. Before the A&s;&s;emblies met, the Abbot of <HI>Fenelon</HI> had time to Compile a Vindication of Madam <HI>Guyon</HI>'s Books; but not|with&s;tanding all his Precaution, they were Con|demn'd with one general Voice. Madam <HI>Guyon</HI> had promi&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the Judgment of the&s;e three Doctors, as well as the Abbot of <HI>Fenelon.</HI> And both of 'em &s;eeming to &s;ubmit, the&s;e Judges
<PB N="67" REF="220">
thought the Matter was laid a&s;leep, tho at the &s;ame time, the Fire was only &s;moother'd under the A&s;hes. The Abbot of <HI>Fenelon,</HI> had a mind to be a Bi&s;hop, before he kindled it again. And in effect, he was no &s;ooner In&s;tall'd Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> but he return'd to his Vomit, notwith|&s;tanding that he had invited the two Prelates that Contemn'd his Doctrine, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Ceremony of his Con&s;ecration. However, he went on with a great deal of Precaution, pretending that the Sentence pronounced again&s;t him, was only owing to a mi&s;under&s;tanding of the true Sen&s;e of the Books under Examination. He gave high Enco|miums of the Vertue of that Lady, which at that time began to be more warmly attack'd than before, for 'twas alledg'd, She had only reviv'd <HI>Molinos</HI>'s Doctrine for a Cloak to the di&s;orderly things &s;he was charg'd with. Madam <HI>Guyon,</HI> for her part was &s;o far from a true Submi&s;&s;ion to the Cen&s;ure of tho&s;e Judges, that &s;he began again to Write a Vindication of her Doctrine. The Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> who pretended all along to keep in with the two Prelates that had Con|demn'd him, as if the Allegations he had made on the behalf of the Lady, and her Principles, were &s;uch as they would have joyn'd with, if they had been fully acquainted with her Per&s;on and Doctrines. This Prelate, I &s;ay, made a coun|terfeit Cen&s;ure of the liberty that the Lady took in &s;etting Pen to Paper again. At la&s;t, the King was inform'd of the Matter, but &s;o, that nothing was &s;aid again&s;t the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray;</HI> either becau&s;e they had a mind to try if they could gain him otherwi&s;e, or becau&s;e they fear'd his Plot was &s;o well contriv'd, that he would come off clear, notwith&s;tanding all the Te&s;timony they could bring again&s;t him. Madam <HI>Guyon</HI> was Im|pri&s;on'd at <HI>Vincennes,</HI> by the King's Order. As the Mind of Man is always curious and fond
<PB N="68" REF="221">
of Novelties, &s;o her Books were &s;ought for e|very where, in&s;omuch that there was not half enough for tho&s;e that wanted 'em. This Lady had a Daughter that was married to the <HI>Count de Vaux,</HI> the Elde&s;t Son of the late Mr. <HI>Fouquet,</HI> Superintendant of the Finances. He was Brother to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Charo&s;t;</HI> and being troubled at the Impri&s;onment of his Mother-in-Law, as, indeed, he ought to have been, He left no Stone unturn'd to procure her relea&s;e. The Abbot of <HI>Fenelon</HI> did the &s;ame thing under hand. 'Twas repre&s;ented to the King, that &s;he her&s;elf would condemn her own Advances, if &s;he thought they imported what was alleg'd again&s;t her, and that &s;he was &s;o far from meaning any &s;uch thing, that &s;he thought her&s;elf oblig'd to take up her Pen again to undeceive the World; but &s;ince His Maje&s;ty was di&s;pleas'd with her Writing, &s;he would take care not to tran&s;gre&s;s his Orders for the future. In fine, her Re&s;olution to &s;ubmit to the Doctrine of the Church, was &s;o dextrou&s;ly repre&s;ented to the King, that he conde&s;cended to &s;et her at liberty, upon condition, that &s;he &s;hould retire to a Con|vent, ju&s;t by <HI>Paris,</HI> where her Conduct might be more narrowly in&s;pected: Thither &s;he went, and behaved her&s;elf for &s;ome time &s;o well, that 'twas really believ'd &s;he was wean'd from her Errors. In the mean time, this thing having made a great noi&s;e, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> re&s;olv'd to publi&s;h a Book to undeceive tho&s;e that might favour the New Doctrine. He communicated his De&s;ign not only to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chalons,</HI> who was then made Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris;</HI> but likewi&s;e to the Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Cambray.</HI> He gave the latter to know, that he hop'd he would affix his Approbation to the Book, which he de&s;ir'd both out of re&s;pect to him, and for enforcing and recommending it to the World. He repre&s;ented farther, That there was a general Report, that he had favour'd that La|dy;
<PB N="69" REF="222">
and that by this means he would &s;hew to the World, that tho' he once thought well of her, yet he did not &s;ub&s;cribe to her Errors. The Bi|&s;hoy of <HI>Meaux</HI> alledges, That he promi&s;ed his Approbation, and that after this interview, they parted good Friends. This he avers openly in a Book of his that's but ju&s;t Publi&s;hed. How|ever, the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray</HI> went &s;ome days after, to vi&s;it the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> and ac|quainted him, that he had a mind to write upon that Subject him&s;elf, but would not put his Book to the Pre&s;s, before he knew his Sentiments of it. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris</HI> endeavour'd to di&s;&s;uade him from pur&s;uing his De&s;ign, and re|mon&s;trated to him, That the lea&s;t partiality to that Lady's Tenets, would infallibly ruine him. The other reply'd, That he might ea&s;ily imagine he had no mind to Print any ill thing, &s;ince he offered to &s;hew it fir&s;t to him. But this An&s;|wer did not plea&s;e the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris.</HI> He continued his utmo&s;t endeavour to take him off from his Re&s;olution; but at la&s;t finding he could not prevail, he de&s;ir'd, that at lea&s;t, he &s;hould not Print his Book till the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> had Publi&s;hed his. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray</HI> promis'd not to do it; and the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris</HI> thinking he would keep his word, ac|quainted the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> with what he had &s;aid. In the mean time he expected a &s;ight of the Manu&s;cript; and, indeed, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cam|bary</HI> &s;ent it to him, but it was writ in &s;uch an ab|&s;tracted manner, that the fir&s;t time he read it, he could under&s;tand little or nothing of it. In that Manu&s;cript he &s;et forth, That if the Doctrine of the Quieti&s;ts con&s;i&s;ted in the belief of &s;uch and &s;uch things, he was ready to Condemn it; but if it maintain'd &s;uch and &s;uch things, he was ready to vindicate it. Thus was his Book divided into &s;everal Chapters, &s;ome containing a de&s;cription
<PB N="70" REF="223">
of the Quieti&s;m, That all Doctors ought to re|ject; and others of the Quieti&s;m, That, as he alledg'd, all the World ought to approve of. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who had not much time to peru&s;e it, being much taken up in the exerci&s;e of his Epi&s;copal Office, thought he might keep the Manu&s;cript as long as he would, e&s;pe|cially con&s;idering, that the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cam|bray</HI> had promis'd not to put it to the Pre&s;s till the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI>'s Book was Publi&s;hed. But he would needs have it again, and the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris</HI> gave it him, after he had &s;hewn him two or three Chapters that he thought proper to be lick'd over again. But, after all, this Book was Publi&s;hed before the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI>'s; and the Author having thus broke his word to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> fell out both with him and the other Prelate. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chartres</HI> joyn'd with them in repre&s;enting to the King the per|nicious Con&s;equences that would in&s;ue upon the toleration of that New Doctrine. His Maje&s;ty having &s;poke of it to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cam|bray,</HI> that Prelate pretended to maintain, that he had &s;aid nothing in his Book, but what was con|formable to the Tradition of the Church; and that he was willing to refer the matter to <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;ubmit to their deci&s;ion. The King not be|ing qualify'd to judge of the&s;e things him&s;elf, was oblig'd to &s;trike Sail to &s;uch a plau&s;ible &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion: But the other three Prelates being &s;till at his Ear, remon&s;trated to him, That 'twas not pro|per for the Royal Off-&s;pring to be under the Con|duct of a Man that was &s;o notoriou&s;ly &s;u&s;pected of Here&s;ie. This gave His Maje&s;ty &s;uch an Alarm, that he ordered the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray</HI> to re|tire to his Archbi&s;hoprick. In the mean time, the Cau&s;e was transferr'd to <HI>Rome,</HI> as being the only Tribunal capable to determine a Que&s;tion of that Nature. Each of the Parties endeavour'd to
<PB N="71" REF="224">
make Friends in that place. Mr. <HI>Bo&s;&s;uet</HI> &s;ent his Nephew thither, who, by the Intere&s;t he had be|yond others, might be capable to put his Orders in Execution. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray</HI> &s;ent likewi&s;e a Per&s;on that he confided in, tho' his greate&s;t hopes depended upon Cardinal <HI>Bouillon,</HI> who was his particular Friend. He order'd him to prolong the Affair as much as po&s;&s;ible, that he might have time to &s;et things in a clear light, and to give His Holine&s;s to under&s;tand, that the op|po&s;ition he met with proceeded more from a party concern, than from a Religious Zeal. In the mean while, Madam <HI>Guyon</HI>'s Principles were found in the Royal Abbey of St. <HI>Lewis</HI> at St. <HI>Cir,</HI> and a di&s;co|very was made, that &s;ome Nuns were &s;o influ|enc'd by 'em, that they were downright Quieti&s;ts. Madam <HI>Maintenon</HI> was mightily troubled at this, &s;he being the Per&s;on to whom the Nobility of <HI>France</HI> owes the Erecting of that Religious Hou&s;e, in which they have the opportunity of being rid of their Daughters for a time, and &s;ometimes for ever: And what troubled her yet more, a Nun that was her particular Favourite, was one of the poy&s;on'd number. However, the King tran&s;plant|ed 'em to other Convents, to prevent their infect|ing of the re&s;t. This Sect which had been ex|tinct at <HI>Rome</HI> from the Condemnation of <HI>Molinos,</HI> began to revive there, when the Abettors under|&s;tood, that it &s;till had footing beyond the <HI>Alps,</HI> and even that an Archbi&s;hop had openly declar'd him&s;elf a Protector of it. Such was the confor|mity of their Sentiments with his, that they cry'd up whatever he advanc'd; and tho' they did not know him, and indeed had &s;carce ever heard of him, yet the whole City was pre&s;ently fill'd with &s;everal Writings, in which they not only applaud|ed his Doctrine, but made an infinite number of <HI>Panegyricks</HI> upon his Per&s;on, as if they had been intimately acquainted with him. The Archbi&s;hop
<PB N="72" REF="225">
of <HI>Cambray</HI> being acquainted with all that pa&s;s'd at <HI>Rome</HI> by an Expre&s;s he had &s;ent thither, did not neverthele&s;s confide &s;o much in them, as to ab&s;tain from Writing him&s;elf: For he &s;ent 'em &s;everal Papers by way of Letters, in which he explain'd the Objections made again&s;t his Book, in order to rectifie the con&s;equences that might be drawn from thence. In the mean time, nothing was &s;aid to Madam <HI>Guyon,</HI> nor to the Archbi&s;hop's Friends that were about the Children of <HI>France.</HI> Among the&s;e was the Abbot of <HI>Beaumont</HI> his Ne|phew, to whom he had procur'd the place of be|ing Sub-praeceptor to the young Princes, and who had always acted up to the Duty of his Po&s;t. In regard 'tis natural for a Nephew to adhere to his Uncle, and that the obligation he had receiv'd from his Uncle, &s;ugge&s;ted a Pre&s;umption, that he would not ea&s;ily depart from his Intere&s;t, the King was &s;ollicited to di&s;grace him. 'Twas re|pre&s;ented to His Maje&s;ty, That the Young Prin|ces were not &s;afe under his Conduct, no more than under his Uncle's; and that tho' he had not publickly taken up with his Errors, yet 'twas to be fear'd he might &s;uck in their Contagion. The King thought it an unju&s;t thing, upon a &s;imple &s;u&s;picion, to turn a Man out of his Po&s;t, that could not be convicted of any Crime. He was re&s;olv'd to &s;ee farther into the matter before he would conde&s;cend to any &s;uch thing. Thus was he continued in his place, and his Enemies were forc'd to wait for a more favourable opportunity to ruine him.</P>
<P>While the Bi&s;hops were thus making War one with another, two Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Orders were re|concil'd, that had not always liv'd in a good un|der&s;tanding; I mean the Je&s;uits and the Prie&s;ts of the Oratory, who upon &s;everal occa&s;ions have de|mon&s;trated to the World, that they are not al|ways of the &s;ame Opinion. The Doctor of St.
<PB N="73" REF="226">
<HI>Martha,</HI> a Per&s;on of great Merit, di&s;tingui&s;hing Piety, and profound Learning, was turn'd out from being General of the Prie&s;ts of the Oratory, by the intrigues of the Je&s;uits, &s;upported by the late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>de Chanvallon,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris.</HI> To pry into what was done in that Society, the Je|&s;uits, as well as the Archbi&s;hop, had got a fal&s;e Brother there, who gave 'em notice of every thing, &s;o that no-body could imagine how the di&s;|covery came; for he was &s;o di&s;guis'd, that he was taken for the greate&s;t Zealot of all the Brethren. An Archbi&s;hoprick was promis'd him in recom|pence for his Service, and the Good Fathers were as good as their word in due time, that is, when they found another of their Society, that pro|mis'd to perform what he did. The conferring of a Bi&s;hoprick upon this Traitor, rais'd a &s;u&s;|picion in that Society; but &s;ince it might be at|tributed to &s;omething el&s;e than the true Cau&s;e, that was not enough for a true Conviction. At that time the Traitor of St. <HI>Martha</HI> was not yet depos'd; he continuing his &s;teady Cour&s;e, quickly ob&s;erv'd that there were Traitors among them, tho' he did not determine whether the Bi&s;hop or another. However, that Bi&s;hop being remov|ed from thence, the &s;impler &s;ort of People look|ed upon that as a vindication of him, tho' the more &s;en&s;ible part of Mankind did not excu&s;e him the more for that. They fancy'd what was true, that he had given his Place to another, who would be equally zealous upon the pro&s;pect of the like Recompence. They were in the right of it; for they did nothing but what the Arch|bi&s;hop and the Je&s;uits knew: However they did not trouble them&s;elves, being &s;en&s;ible that they did nothing but what was to be done. In the mean time, the Doctor of St. <HI>Martha</HI> had occa|&s;ion to have &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s with the Archbi&s;hop; and one day when he had his Audience, that
<PB N="74" REF="227">
Prelate put him into his Clo&s;et, till he had fini&s;h'd a Conference with a per&s;on upon a bu|&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;equence. As &s;oon as the Doctor enter'd the Clo&s;et, he &s;py'd upon the Table, a|mong other Papers, one that he knew to be the Hand of one of his Prie&s;ts; and having the curio&s;ity to know what it was, found it to be an account he gave the Archbi&s;hop of a thing that had been privately concerted among them. This Paper he put in his Pocket, thinking the Arch|bi&s;hop would not perceive that 'twas he that took it, and carry'd it home, after fini&s;hing the Affair he came upon. Immediately upon his re|turn he con&s;ulted with tho&s;e of his Society, that he knew would be faithful in keeping the &s;ecret, whether or not he &s;hould &s;hew this Paper to him that wrote it. Some were again&s;t the &s;hewing of it, becau&s;e that would give the Archbi&s;hop to know, that 'twas he that took it; but others thought this no inconveniency; nay, on the con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ary, they thought they were oblig'd to &s;hew that they knew both the Traitor and the Treache|ry. The Father joyn'd with the la&s;t, and accor|dingly took a&s;ide the writer of the Paper that was then in his Pocket, and check'd him for what he had done. The writer offer'd to deny the Fact, fancying that he &s;poke only by &s;u&s;|picion. Then the Father of St. <HI>Martha</HI> advis'd him in a Chri&s;tian manner, not to add a Lye to his former Fault, and withal acquainted him, that he knew all the particulars, for which rea|&s;on 'twas in vain for him to offer to di&s;gui&s;e any thing. The treacherous Brother was of the &s;ame Humour with tho&s;e, who, when once they have advanc'd a thing, could rather &s;ee it cut in peices, than lop any thing of it: For in pur&s;uance of their Temper, he in&s;i&s;ted &s;till upon the Negative. But the General not being able longer to bear his impudent Lying, produc'd the writing out of
<PB N="75" REF="228">
his Pocket, and prov'd the Charge again&s;t him by his own hand Writing. The Traitor was migh|tily &s;urpriz'd at the appearance of the Paper; having then nothing more to &s;ay, all his re&s;erve was to cry out upon the Archbi&s;hop for ruining him entirely, by giving his Paper to the Gene|ral. The Archbi&s;hop made Oath that it did not come that way; and well he might, &s;ince it was di&s;cover'd as above. However, the Archbi&s;hop &s;melling from thence, that the Father had &s;natch'd up that Paper when he was in the Clo&s;et, advis'd the fal&s;e Brother not to be concern'd, for that he would procure the Royal Protection for him, in ca&s;e his Society offer'd to affront him. In effect, the Society of which he was a Member de&s;ign'd to expel him; but the Archbi&s;hop prohibited them in the King's Name, to think of it; &s;o that he continued among the&s;e Prie&s;ts, and does to this day. In the mean time the Archbi&s;hop could not for|get the Trick that the Father of St. <HI>Martha</HI> had plaid him. That joyn'd with other things, gave the Archbi&s;hop an opportunity of repre&s;enting him to the King as a Jan&s;eni&s;t, and imploying the Royal Authority to depo&s;e him. Father <HI>de la Tour,</HI> the pre&s;ent General of that Order, was elected in his room, and de&s;erv'd that Po&s;t upon &s;everal accounts, e&s;pecially by rea&s;on of his &s;in|gular Piety, and di&s;tingui&s;hing Zeal. The Je|&s;uits oppos'd his Election under hand, alledging, That he was as much a Jan&s;eni&s;t as the Father of St. <HI>Martha.</HI> Several things were offer'd to|wards his ju&s;tification; but that very thing that was de&s;ign'd for his further Ruine, prevented his exclu&s;ion. He was Confe&s;&s;or to one Madam <HI>de Fond Pertuis,</HI> that was a zealous Devotee to Mr. <HI>Arnaud,</HI> in&s;omuch that &s;he went to <HI>Flanders</HI> &s;everal times during the la&s;t War. This new General having advice of this, prohibited her to return to <HI>Flanders</HI> again, unle&s;s &s;he cho&s;e another

Confe&s;&s;or. But &s;he did not &s;tand to go thither once more, in &s;pite of his order to the contrary. However he did not offer to enquire further into her Conduct; but the thing being heard of at Court; the King &s;aw plainly that he was not &s;o much a Jan&s;eni&s;t as he was repre&s;ented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">to be, in regard he cen&s;ur'd that Lady's adhering to one that was reckon'd the head of that Sect. Thus was his exclu&s;ion prevented; and the Je&s;uits finding what a good Opinion the King had of him, invited him to P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ch a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;olemn Fe&s;tival in the Church of St. <HI>Louis.</HI> He return'd their Complement by de|&s;iring them to &s;ingle out one of their Society to Preach before the Prie&s;ts of the Oratory, upon the day of another &s;olemn Fe&s;tival. Thus was the Reconciliation brought about, that I &s;poke of but now. But, after all, I doubt if the Je|&s;uits were cordial in the matter; for this Gene|ral had for &s;ome time indeavour'd to &s;tifle their Practice. A great many Ladies of Quality that us'd to confe&s;s to Father <HI>Bourdaloux,</HI> or &s;ome of their Society, de&s;ir'd that he might be their Di|rector. Among others the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Aumont</HI> de&s;erted them, and put in with him: And this be|ing a Practice that &s;eldom pa&s;&s;es with impunity among Directors, would have eterniz'd the Quar|rel between the two Companies, if the Je&s;uits, who have fully as much Policy as Learning, had not thought it proper to take no farther notice of it. At this day Father <HI>de la Tour</HI> Preaches in their Church; but as he is not equal to many of 'em, either in Gracefulne&s;s or Eloquence, &s;o they did not &s;tand to give him the precedency as to the Direction of Con&s;ciences, becau&s;e he, for his part, was oblig'd to &s;toop to them in the way of Preaching.

and Married her, upon whch his Mother di&s;inherited him. After he had quench'd his Pa&s;|&s;ion with Enjoyment, he quickly became &s;en&s;ible of his Fault; but 'twas then too late to think of a Remedy. However, being very much troubled for the lo&s;s of &s;uch a fine Succe&s;&s;ion, he left <HI>Lions,</HI> where he was wont to live, and came to <HI>Paris;</HI> having fir&s;t in&s;tructed his Wife in what &s;he was to do towards the backing of his De|&s;ign. The Orders he gave her, were, to go into the Country, and &s;pread a Report in the City, that &s;he was at the Point of Death: Now, it being cu&s;tomary in all places to inlarge Reports as they &s;pread, the whole City of <HI>Lions</HI> was pre&s;ently fill'd with the noi&s;e, not only of the Lady's &s;ham Illne&s;s, but even of her Death. Her Husband, who had been hitherto fru&s;trated in all his attempts towards the regaining of his Mother's Favour, knowing how ca&s;es &s;tood at <HI>Lions,</HI> went into deep mourning, and &s;o repair|ed to St. <HI>Eu&s;tache,</HI> where his Mother commonly went.

She invited him to come and &s;ee her; and the Deed by which he was di&s;inherited being tore, he found ways and means to retain her Friend&s;hip, in&s;omuch, that &s;he not only par|don'd his Marriage, but likewi&s;e his abu&s;ing of her Credulity, in making her believe that his Wife was Dead.</P>

Madam <HI>Harlai</HI>'s three other Keepers were the Attorney General's Lady, Madam <HI>Harouis,</HI> and Madam <HI>Chateaurenard.</HI> This la&s;t was the hand|&s;ome&s;t of all the four, but had not been always &s;o devout as they, for &s;he was mightily taken up in the way of the World: But the di&s;grace of her Husband's Family, with &s;ome other melancho|ly Circum&s;tances that are not uncommon in the way of Life, oblig'd her to pur&s;ue a cour&s;e that might &s;creen her from all di&s;quiet; &s;o that &s;he became &s;o very pious, that her Piety was a pat|tern for tho&s;e who had grown old in the pur&s;uit of it, before ever &s;he thought of &s;uch a cour&s;e of Life. Her Husband was the Son of the late Mr. <HI>Dacquin,</HI> the King's fir&s;t Phy&s;ician, who not being &s;atisfied with the E&s;tate he had, occa&s;ion'd his own Bani&s;hment from the Court, by impor|tuning the King with un&s;ea&s;onable Reque&s;ts: Nay, he was &s;o bold, as to repre&s;ent to His Ma|je&s;ty, that his Services were at lea&s;t equal to any that could be done of what nature &s;oever; and in effect, that &s;ince his Life was to him the mo&s;t precious and dear thing in the World, 'twas an obvious con&s;ideration, that the per&s;on who pre|&s;erv'd it by his Pre&s;criptions, was not be de&s;pi&s;|ed. Before he ventur'd upon &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es, that is, while he ob&s;erv'd the mea&s;ures of Re&s;pect, due to His Maje&s;ty; both he and his Family had a thou&s;and liberal Gifts conferr'd upon 'em. His Maje&s;ty had made his Elde&s;t Son Secretary of his own Clo&s;et, and an honorary Coun&s;ellor of the Parliament, a favour that is not promi&s;cuou&s;ly granted; and be&s;ides all this, he was Intendant of the Generality of <HI>Moulins.</HI> When this Honour was conferr'd upon him, he was &s;carce twenty five Years old. But immediately upon his Fa|ther's beginning to talk &s;o high, he was included in his Father's Di&s;grace, and recall'd. The Name of <HI>Chateaurenard</HI> which he bore, was the Title
<PB N="80" REF="233">
of an E&s;tate he bought from Mr. <HI>Amat,</HI> the Son of a famous Farmer of the Revenues. This <HI>Amat,</HI> who &s;carce under&s;tood his Intere&s;t &s;o well as his Father, di&s;cover'd upon his fir&s;t imbarking in the World, that Gaming was his only de|light; and upon that &s;core, &s;everal Sharpers Courted him in hopes to have part of the Riches left him by his Father. Among others, an En|&s;ign of the Life-Guard had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">pretty good &s;ucce&s;s; for he won of him a large &s;um in ready Money, and another upon tick. But that &s;ort of Com|merce being the King's aver&s;ion, and the En&s;ign being better vers'd in &s;huffling the Cards, than in un&s;heathing his Sword for the King's Service; Up|on the&s;e con&s;iderations, he was broke when His Maje&s;ty purg'd the Companies of their &s;candalous Members. The above-mentioned E&s;tate belonged formerly to a very good Family of that Name. It had once a Ca&s;tle upon it that &s;erv'd to over-awe the <HI>Burgundians,</HI> when they were under the Dukes of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> who were the greate&s;t Enemies that ever the Kings of <HI>France</HI> had; notwith&s;tanding that they had the honour to &s;pring from their Blood. The Heir of that Family having done &s;omething in oppo&s;ition to the King's Intere&s;t; his E&s;tate was forfeited and reunited to the Royal Deme&s;|nes. The Family of <HI>Chatillon Coligni,</HI> who&s;e Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions were adjacent to that E&s;tate, bought it of the King as lying conveniently for them, and kept it a great many Years, till <HI>William</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> Married <HI>Loui&s;e de Coligni,</HI> the Daughter of Admiral <HI>de Coligni,</HI> who bears &s;o great a Fi|gure in our Hi&s;tory; by which means it pa&s;s'd into the Hou&s;e of <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> and there continued till the Princes of <HI>Orange,</HI> the pre&s;ent King of <HI>England</HI>'s Mother, &s;old it as her Son's Guardian to Mr. <HI>Amat</HI> Farmer of the Revenues. At this day the Arms of the Princes of <HI>Orange</HI> are placed in the mo&s;t eminent part of the City, if it be allowable to

call a Place a City, that is only a Hole, and that one of the mo&s;t wretched Holes in the Univer&s;e.

But &s;uch a Reque&s;t de&s;erving no An&s;wer, that Mini&s;ter gave 'em none; and thus were the Arms pre&s;erv'd from their mi&s;taken Zeal; &s;o that they &s;tand to this day where they were plac'd an Age ago.</P>
<P>At that time the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Dax</HI> Died; and his Death robb'd the publick of his Hi&s;tory of the King, which he was carrying on, upon the pre|cedent of Mr. <HI>Perefixe</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. He thought it became a Bi&s;hop to undertake that &s;ort of performance. But after all, if he had employ'd his time in fini&s;hing the Hi&s;tory of the Church begun by Mr. <HI>Godeau;</HI> that Province, as I take it, had been more &s;uitable to his Chara|cter. However, he &s;earch'd every corner for the finding of Memoirs to an&s;wer his De&s;ign. And not long before his Death, I &s;aw him come to one of my Friends, that had belong'd to Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> to know of him, whether the late King of <HI>England</HI> was pre&s;ent at the Negotiation of Peace, carry'd on by that Mini&s;ter, with <HI>Don Louis de Haro,</HI> in 1659. Upon his departure, my Friend acquainted me with the occa&s;ion of his Vi&s;it; which was to me a mighty &s;urpri&s;al, for that all the World knows, that <HI>that</HI> Prince would have been there, but that his Eminence would not allow of it. The Rea&s;on he went upon, was, That he fear'd the di&s;obliging of <HI>Richard</HI> the Son of <HI>Crom|wel,</HI> who had been declar'd Protector of <HI>England</HI> after his Father's Death. So that <HI>that</HI> Prince who had advanc'd within &s;ix Leagues of the place where
<PB N="82" REF="235">
the Conferences were held, was oblig'd to return. My Lord <HI>Bath,</HI> whom he had &s;ent to know if his Pre&s;ence would be acceptable, receiv'd this An&s;|wer, That 'twas not proper for him to appear there; and that the above-mentioned Mini&s;ter would &s;till take the &s;ame care of his Intere&s;t. But had the Prince been &s;o &s;imple as to tru&s;t him, and take no other mea&s;ures, he had been in a fair way of never mounting his Throne. The Bi&s;hop I mention'd but now, had re&s;ign'd his Bi&s;hoprick a great while ago, perhaps in order to have the more lei&s;ure to pur&s;ue his Hi&s;tory: 'Tis probable he thought to out-do <HI>Racine,</HI> or <HI>Boileau;</HI> but I que&s;tion if he &s;hould have &s;ucceeded: If his Talent lay that way, I mu&s;t &s;ay that it was a hidden one; for he was never found to be capable of doing much.</P>
<P>Had the Marquis of <HI>Rouville,</HI> who was eighty Years old, died as he did, he had not &s;u&s;tain'd &s;o great a lo&s;s, becau&s;e he had not any Hi&s;tory upon the Stocks; but in&s;tead of Dying, the old Gen|tleman acted the part of a very Lively Man, and one that had no mind to die &s;o &s;oon. He com|menc'd a &s;uit again&s;t his Relations, who mean'd to interdict him, under the pretence that he was very old; and having always been an ill Husband, there was no hopes of his growing better in his old days. Had the late Prince been &s;till alive, and &s;ate as his Judge, he had not only given it for his Adver&s;aries, but order'd him to be Impri|&s;on'd; for he us'd to &s;ay, that if there had been two <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="6 letters">es</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> he would not &s;cruple to leave it for his Life-time. His meaning was, That he was the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome Man in the World: which was al&s;o the Opinion of a good many People, who, in imitation of this Prince, did not &s;atisfie them&s;elves with Trifles. He cho&s;e ra|ther the Condition of one of his own Men in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Corner, at <HI>Chantilly,</HI> than to be oblig'd
<PB N="83" REF="236">
to hear &s;uch an idle Fellow &s;peak; nor did he &s;tand to &s;ay, that he was far le&s;s unea&s;ie with his Pullets, and the other Creatures that he kept in his Managry, and vi&s;ited twice a day, than he would be with Men of his Character. Yet it was a &s;trange manner of Occupation for a Prince, &s;o famous for having gain'd &s;o many Battels, and who&s;e very fir&s;t E&s;&s;ays in War had equal'd the Actions of tho&s;e that grew old in the Trade. The Enter|prize of <HI>Barcelona</HI> was &s;till in hand, as well as the de&s;ign to have the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> cho&s;en King of <HI>Poland;</HI> and the Court was exceeding di|ligent to bring both the Affairs to a happy I&s;&s;ue. The one was, indeed, more ea&s;ier than the other, tho' both appeared very hard; at lea&s;t, there was &s;ome rea&s;on to judge the latter more ea&s;ie than the former, becau&s;e all they had to do, was, to &s;pare no money to make it &s;ucceed; they were only to gain the Votes of tho&s;e who are always for the highe&s;t Bidder; for as that is the Harve&s;t of the <HI>Poles,</HI> who reap nothing when they have a King upon the Throne; &s;o it is long &s;ince they own'd their re&s;emblance of the <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> in regard nothing is to be done with them without money. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> had &s;ent thither already two hundred thou&s;and Crowns of his own, and the King for his part, who would have reap'd a great advantage, by obtaining that Crown for the Prince, &s;ent fourtimes as much. Abbot <HI>Polignac,</HI> the King's Amba&s;&s;ador at that Court, di&s;tributed the money among&s;t tho&s;e he had engag'd in his Party, and taking that Election to depend intirely upon Cardinal <HI>Radzionwski,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Gne&s;ne,</HI> who by virtue of this la&s;t Dignity, was Prince and Regent of the Kingdom, during the va|cancy of the Throne, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lavi&s;h'd his money upon him, while he thought it &s;ufficient to feed others with fine Promi&s;es. But the Generals of the Ar|my of the Crown, and the <HI>Lithua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ian</HI> Troops,
<PB N="84" REF="237">
who were equally &s;harp &s;et with the Cardinal, did not find their Account in that &s;ort of manage|ment; neither were the <HI>Palatines</HI> &s;atisfied, fora&s;|much as they thought their Swords de&s;erv'd to be con&s;idered no le&s;s than the Cardinal's Mitre. Ab|bot <HI>Polignac</HI> had di&s;guis'd his Project for a long time, and made the Queen <HI>Dowager</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> be|lieve, that the King, his Ma&s;ter, had only put up the Prince of <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nti</HI> by way of Provi&s;ion, in ca&s;e there were no other in whom he could confide. Be|&s;ides that, the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> was very-indiffer|ent upon the matter; and if he con&s;ented to it, 'twas rather to plea&s;e the King, than to gratifie his Inclination. So far he &s;aid well; and that Prince who was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of <HI>France,</HI> was afraid of nothing more, than to hear that he was elected King of <HI>Poland.</HI> But as for His Maje&s;ty, he was of another mind, for he de&s;ir'd nothing more earne&s;tly than to &s;ee the Crown upon that Prince's Head, by rea&s;on of the advantage he ex|pected from thence. The Queen <HI>Dowager</HI> being, like mo&s;t people, ea&s;ily per&s;waded to believe what &s;he wi&s;h'd gave credit to the in&s;inuations of Abbot <HI>Polignac.</HI> She took a great deal of pains to ju&s;tifie to him her Conduct, in what &s;he had done for &s;everal Years again&s;t the King's Intere&s;t; and gave him to know, that His Maje&s;ty had for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">'d her to it by his ill u&s;age; and that when|ever His Maje&s;ty pleas'd to alter his mea&s;ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s with reference to her, &s;he would really &s;hew, that &s;he d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">r'd nothing more than the re&s;toring of the good under&s;tanding that had been betwixt the two Crowns in the beginning of the Reign of the King her late Husband.

<PB N="85" REF="238">
that His Maje&s;ty ought not to fear that the Al|liance he had concluded with a &s;u&s;pected Family, would oblige him to counteract his Intere&s;t; that he knew well, that Princes have but little regard for their Wive's Relations, at a time when either their Glory or Grandure are in view; and that her Son would continue in an in&s;eparable U|nion with his Crown, in&s;omuch that he would put the Service of His Maje&s;ty upon the &s;ame ballance with his own.</P>
<P>The&s;e words were very acceptable to the Ab|bot of <HI>Polignac,</HI> who knew, that a Reconciliation between two Parties is the more &s;incere, when both &s;ides are eager in ju&s;tifying their pa&s;t Con|duct. Nay, he pretended to have &s;ome &s;en&s;e of the ju&s;tne&s;s of her Complaints again&s;t the King, in order to in&s;inuate him&s;elf more effectually in|to her Brea&s;t. In fine, he agreed with her to transfer all the Votes for the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> to her Son; and upon that con&s;ideration &s;he pro|mis'd to u&s;e her utmo&s;t efforts in taking off <HI>Sapi|eha,</HI> great General of <HI>Lith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ania,</HI> from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> the Intere&s;t of which he &s;eem'd to e&s;pou&s;e very warmly. <HI>Sapieha</HI> was extream powerful in that Dutchy, and was rather Ma&s;ter than General of it, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing va&s;t Territories, and great Char|ges in it, which was the rea&s;on that every one trembled under him. The Abbot of <HI>Polignac</HI> had no other de&s;ign in it, but to weaken the party of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> flattering him&s;elf with the Thoughts, that Prince <HI>James</HI> his Party would ne|ver be able to make Head again&s;t his own; for he was very far from thinking to keep his word to the Queen, and all he &s;aid to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">, was only to the end he might the more ea&s;ily deceive her. Neverthele&s;s &s;he was &s;o credulous, that to a&s;&s;ure him the better of the Confidence &s;he had in him, &s;he &s;ent him her Picture, which he &s;eem'd to have de&s;ir'd very earne&s;tly. He &s;et it up in the mo&s;t con|&s;picuous

She endeavour'd to take off <HI>Sapieha</HI> from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria. Sapieha</HI> did not deceive her in the lea&s;t. He told her freely, That he was &s;o engag'd in the Intere&s;t of that Family, that there was but one thing that could oblige him to quit it, and that was, to have the Crown &s;et upon his own Head, and that it was in her power to con|tribute to it, if &s;he pleas'd: That &s;he &s;hould only joyn her Intere&s;t, with that he could make for him|&s;elf; which if &s;he pleas'd to con&s;ent to, he would in|fallibly &s;et her upon the Throne with him; for that he being a Widdower and &s;he a Widdow, no|thing could hinder them from Marrying. The Queen <HI>Dowager,</HI> however earne&s;t &s;he was to Reign, did not at all reli&s;h that Propo&s;al.

<P>The Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> in imitation of that of <HI>France,</HI> caus'd the Mini&s;ters which they had at that Court, to act &s;o &s;ecretly, that it was impo&s;&s;ible, even for the mo&s;t clear &s;ighted, to pry into their Con|duct.

who&s;e Actions they were no &s;trangers to, and knowing that &s;he had &s;ent Money into <HI>France,</HI> they look'd upon her as a Woman that had been always inclin'd that way. They knew that the <HI>French</HI> have always a &s;ecret inclination for their Country, which never dies but with their la&s;t Breath. Be&s;ides, they knew that Prince&s;s had a certain a&s;cendant over her Son, that would a&s;&s;ure her of the Reins of the Government, if ever they &s;et the Crown upon his Head. However, all the&s;e Rea&s;ons were more than &s;ufficient to oblige the Emperor and the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to prefer their own Intere&s;ts, to that of their Brother-in-Law, who was a Prince upon whom they could not rely very much; for he was far &s;hort of the quali|ties of the King his Father. They ca&s;t their Eyes upon a Per&s;on very worthy of that Crown. The Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> a young Prince, who had di|&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf to a great degree in the Wars the Emperor had again&s;t the Infidels, and whom he had &s;et at the Head of his Army, &s;eem'd to both of them to be the Man. His Imperial Ma|je&s;ty labour'd to remove a difficulty that oppos'd their de&s;ign. The Duke was of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Religion, and ever in &s;ome mea&s;ure con&s;idered as the head of all that Party, becau&s;e it was one of his Ance&s;tors that afforded a Retreat to <HI>Lu|ther,</HI> and who, after having embrac'd his Doctrine, undertook al&s;o his protection again&s;t the Emperor, who pretended to have him puni&s;hed, becau&s;e he dar'd to Preach a New Religion. It is truly a&s;toni|&s;hing, why his Imperial Maje&s;ty and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> would not rather endeavour to chu&s;e the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who was Son-in-Law to the one, and Nephew to the other, he being al&s;o a Catholick, which was a nece&s;&s;ary Quality for the King of <HI>Po|land:</HI> Be&s;ides, he was much Richer than the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and that is no mean quality to be con&s;idered in a de&s;ign of that Nature: But

However charming the propo&s;ition was; he con&s;ider'd the Condition they annexed to it was too weighty for him.

He began to infinuate to him, that both the fir&s;t <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Lutherans</HI> had always believ'd, that one might as well be &s;av'd in the Catholick Religion, as in Theirs; and that the Crown they propos'd to him, was certainly well worth all the trouble they asked of him; and at the &s;ame time made him conver&s;e with a num|ber of Doctors, that pu&s;hed the Affair a great deal further, and alledg'd a great many Rea&s;ons to prove, that the Catholick Religion was the on|ly true Religion, and that which had been always profe&s;s'd in the Church.</P>
<P>The Bright lu&s;tre of the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> made the Duke reli&s;h their admirable Rea&s;ons; and &s;ome Mini&s;ters who conferr'd before him with the&s;e Doctors (tho' neither the one nor the other knew to what purpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e all this was doing) a|greed, that according to the Explication the Ca|tholicks make now adays of their Faith, it was void of all manner of Venom; &s;o that the Duke was more than half per&s;waded to go all the length they de&s;ir'd of him. The Catholick Do|ctors hearing the Mini&s;ters &s;peak after that man|ner, That the Prince might harbour no further &s;cruple in his mind, alledg'd, that nonehad ever

explain'd their Faith after any other manner than what they do at pre&s;ent, excepting &s;ome &s;ort of People that were glad to make others believe &s;ome different Thing; that one might only read the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> to know the truth of it; and that all tho&s;e of their Religion had no other Doctrine, than &s;uch as was taught there. The Duke was glad that they prepared for him the way he de&s;ir'd; being inform'd by the Em|peror, that his Intrigues in <HI>Poland</HI> were &s;o &s;trong|ly laid, that his Enemies would find it hard to overturn them. There was nothing that di&s;wad|ed him &s;o much from making a profe&s;&s;ion of that Religion, as the fear that his hopes would prove abortive. Accordingly, being a Man of precaution, he promis'd to the Emperor to per|form all they de&s;ir'd of him, upon the provi&s;o of the certainty of his Election: Now, this a&s;|&s;urance that he demanded, was a very difficult Point, becau&s;e it depended upon the Votes of a great many People that were capable of fal&s;ify|ing their words. The very Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cujavia,</HI> tho' he headed the Intere&s;t of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au|&s;tria,</HI> &s;hew'd no great re&s;olution in determining who he &s;hould Vote for, notwith&s;tanding he had already taken of his Money. He de&s;ign'd to make u&s;e of that Election as a means to make him|&s;elf a Cardinal; and was &s;en&s;ible; that what&s;o|ever &s;ide was prefer'd, he would meet with invinci|ble Ob&s;tacsle to his preten&s;ions. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Pa&s;&s;aw</HI> waited only to &s;ee the Emperor's Succe&s;s, in order to make a Propo&s;al for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to that Crown. He being Brother to the Empre&s;s, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cujavia</HI> was convinc'd that he would be too hard for him; and that upon that &s;core the &s;ame thing would be &s;aid to him, that upon the like occa&s;ion was formerly &s;aid to the Coadjutor of <HI>Paris.</HI> Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> had formerly promis'd to inve&s;t him with the Purple, upon the provi&s;o of &s;ome things that were mutually concerted;
<PB N="90" REF="243">
but he forfeited this promi&s;e, the Cardinal de&s;ir'd the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> to procure the nomination of another. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cuja|via</HI> fearing, and that very ju&s;tly, that the &s;ame thing might happen to him, would glad|ly have gone over to the <HI>French</HI> &s;ide, if he had not been jealous of the Abbot of <HI>Polignac,</HI> whom he took to be of &s;uch a Temper, as not to give up the pretentions he equally made to the Cardinal's Cap. In this quandary he caus'd &s;ome to feel his Pul&s;e, to try if he would quit his Preten|tions; but the Abbot being as fond of the prefer|ment as he, thought his reque&s;t very indi&s;creet, and neglected the King's Intere&s;t in carrying on his own. In effect, had he re&s;ign'd his Pretentions to this Prelate, he had, by that means, joyn'd the Prelate's Intere&s;t to his own, and had certain|ly procur'd the Election of the Prince of <HI>Conti.</HI> But he fancied, that by the Primat's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and by the help of &s;ome Money he &s;till expect|ed from <HI>France,</HI> he would compa&s;s his de&s;ign without him.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop perceiving how confident he was of his good Succe&s;s, &s;ince he de&s;pis'd his Of|fers, which any other would have valued at a far higher rate than what he demanded of him, endeavour'd to ca&s;t in &s;ome difference betwixt Him and the Queen of <HI>Poland.</HI> He caus'd in|form that Prince&s;s, that &s;he would be extream|ly impos'd upon, if &s;he rely'd upon his Promi&s;es, and advis'd her to have &s;ome better &s;ecurity of him, than his word, unle&s;s &s;he had a mind to leave room for a future Repentance. The Queen, who was naturally &s;u&s;picious, re&s;olved to make her advantage of this advice; and that &s;he might have the more confidence in <HI>Polignac's</HI> Expre&s;|&s;ions, &s;he de&s;ir'd that he might procu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e for her the King's Letter, by which &s;he might be a&s;|&s;ur'd of what his Maje&s;ty was pleas'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">quaint

her by his Amba&s;&s;ador. The Abbot put her in hopes of it, de&s;igning to elude her, whenever &s;he urg'd him too clo&s;e to make good his Promi&s;e. In the mean time he wrote to <HI>France,</HI> that Af|fairs went fairly for the Prince of <HI>Conti:</HI> But if they de&s;ign'd to make the &s;ucce&s;s not only proba|ble, but infallible, they &s;hould not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ail to &s;end him a con&s;iderable &s;um of Money. The Court of <HI>France</HI> was never in greater nece&s;&s;ity than at that time; having re&s;olv'd to attack <HI>Barcelona,</HI> they were equipping a &s;trong Fleet in <HI>Provence,</HI> that put them to a va&s;t Expence: Be&s;ides, they were con&s;iderably exhau&s;ted to procure a Peace from their Enemies, that at that time was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to them; all their Provinces were ruin'd by the War; and tho' other States were hardly in better Circum&s;tances, yet they were affraid, that the Subjects would &s;carce be any longer capable of bearing &s;o heavy a Charge.</P>
<P>They had been a long time re&s;olv'd (as is al|ready mention'd) upon the de&s;ign of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> in hopes that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who alone with the Emperor oppos'd the Peace, would change their Sentiments, when they &s;aw them&s;elves attack'd even in the very Bowels. For tho' that place, be upon the Frontiers of <HI>France,</HI> yet there be|ing only two or three places of &s;trength betwixt it and <HI>Madrid,</HI> it was not doubted, but that Conque&s;t would Alarm them much more than the lo&s;s of four better places in <HI>Flanders.</HI> But af|ter all, tho' the&s;e Rea&s;ons pleaded for carrying on the attack without any delay, it was never|thele&s;s put off for &s;ome time upon important Con&s;iderations. The very Inhabitants of <HI>Mar&s;eil|les</HI> oppos'd it's Bombardment, in regard they had a great many effects in it, which would have been lo&s;t, if it had been reduc'd to A&s;hes. They made a con&s;iderable Pre&s;ent to the Court, to procure a due regard to their Intere&s;t: But at la&s;t, all the
<PB N="92" REF="245">
Con&s;iderations that retarded the Seige, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> being taken away, it was di&s;cours'd on more warmly than ever.</P>
<P>This Enterprize could not be carried on with|out a great deal of Charge, as I intimated before; but the Court that is &s;eldom &s;en&s;ible of the pub|lick mi&s;eries, and had a Mini&s;ter that found the Mi&s;tery, to rai&s;e as much Money as they pleas'd without overcharging the People, thought that this ought not to hinder them from bringing their E|nemies to a Compliance. In effect, the Provinces were rather mi&s;erable, becau&s;e they wanted Hands to labour the Ground, than that they were over|charg'd by exorbitant Impo&s;ts: So that His Ma|je&s;ty, who was &s;till full of Money, notwith&s;tand|ing all the&s;e immen&s;e Expences, thought fit to &s;atisfie the Abbot of <HI>Polignac,</HI> in regard that he a&s;&s;ur'd them, there was nothing el&s;e wanting to make all have a pro&s;perous Succe&s;s: So that he &s;ent him not only the &s;um he de&s;ir'd, but four hundred thou&s;and Livers over and above; that if he came to fail in his Negotiation, he &s;hould not blame an un&s;ea&s;onable Parcimony. The Queen of <HI>Poland</HI> &s;eeing him receive &s;o large re|mittances, and di&s;tribute them according to the Cardinal's Advice; found him very remote from her Intere&s;t, and began to be extream jealous of his Conduct. She had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that he only thought to amu&s;e her; and as the e&s;teem they had of the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> in that King|dom, was far &s;uperior to that they had for Prince <HI>James</HI> her Son, &s;he began to pre&s;s the Abbot up|on the a&s;&s;urances of his Promi&s;e. He &s;hifted it, by telling her &s;ometimes, that the King being now ready to begin the Campaign, had no time to think of any thing el&s;e; at other times, that the King expected that if he brought over to the party of Prince <HI>James,</HI> the Voices he had gain'd for the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> &s;he would be pleas'd to repay
<PB N="63" REF="246">
him the Money he had &s;ent into that Country, for making the Party.</P>
<P>The Queen's Council could hardly blame &s;o ju&s;t an offer, but di&s;tru&s;ting that it was only a pretence of the Amba&s;&s;ador's to delay Affairs, advis'd the Queen to yield to him in that Article; for if he meant to be ingenuous, the Prince her Son could never fail of the Crown. The Queen be|lieved her Council; and &s;he her&s;elf communicated it to the Abbot; but that Amba&s;&s;ador being now at a lo&s;s what to An&s;wer, thought fit to propo&s;e to her &s;omething concerning his own particular Intere&s;t. He told her, that during the life of the King her Husband, he had the promi&s;e of the Court, that if he got the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> to be cho&s;en King, he &s;hould allow him to name whom he plea&s;|ed for the Cardinal Dignity; that he expected &s;he would be pleas'd to &s;tipulate the &s;ame thing with her Son, that all his pains migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> not be fruitle&s;s; That there were &s;ome Prelats in her Son's Intere&s;t, who had the &s;ame pretentions, in ca&s;e he were cho&s;en King, and that he de&s;ir'd they might re&s;ign in his favour: That Her Maje&s;ty ought not to take it ill, that he &s;hould require this of her; for perhaps in his Lifetime he &s;hould not have &s;o fa|vourable an opportunity to arrive to that honour|able Dignity.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Queen's Council heard him talk af|ter that manner, they were the more confirmed in their Sentiments of him: However, to cut off all opportunities to make u&s;e of that difficulty, they us'd their Intere&s;t with the Prelats that were of Prince <HI>James</HI> his Party, to re&s;ign what the Abbot de&s;ir'd; which they did in con&s;ideration of the pro|mi&s;es the Queen had made to them; and that Prince&s;s acquainting the Amba&s;&s;ador with it, he pretended all went well; and that all that remain|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e done now, was, to reimbur&s;e the &s;ums he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> advanced, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> which he had the Accounts readvly

by him: Now He had not propos'd that as to be done pre&s;ently; all he de&s;ir'd before, was, That when Prince <HI>James</HI> &s;hould be cho&s;en, the Queen and He &s;hould be oblig'd to make that Re&s;titution. So all that were in the Intere&s;t of the Queen, finding that he had only altered his Conduct, the better to amu&s;e her, judged it expedient, that Her Maje&s;ty &s;hould not only break off all mea&s;ures with him, but do it al&s;o very openly. Their Rea&s;on was, That as <HI>France</HI> had it's Enemies as well as Parti&s;ans, the &s;ecret Union which they &s;u&s;pected &s;he entertained with him, hindred tho&s;e who had openly declar|ed them&s;elves again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> to imbrace her In|tere&s;t. The Queen believ'd them, and after once &s;ounding the Abbot of <HI>Polignac</HI> touching his la&s;t Re&s;olution, &s;he made him &s;en&s;ible, That &s;he was no more of an humour to be amus'd. She wrote a Letter al&s;o to the Marchione&s;s of <HI>Bethu|nes,</HI> to be deliver'd to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty. In it &s;he complains of the Abbot's di&s;engenuity; and how u&s;ele&s;ly he lavi&s;h'd the King's Money; for however powerful he believ'd his Intere&s;t, it was no ways capable to equal that of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> except they joyn'd it with hers. This Marchione&s;s was Si&s;ter to the Queen, and both of them were Daughters to the Marquis of <HI>Ar|quien,</HI> who was Captain of the Duke of <HI>Orlean</HI>'s hundred <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI> and afterwards Cardinal, by the Nomination of the late King of <HI>Poland.</HI> The late Prince&s;s <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Gon&s;ague,</HI> had carried that Queen with her into <HI>Poland,</HI> when &s;he her|&s;elf went thither in the &s;ame quality, being Married to <HI>Ladi&s;laus,</HI> who then po&s;&s;e&s;s'd that Crown.

<P>An Officer of the Army of the Crown, who was the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI>'s Subject, having

heard even tho&s;e who received the Money, vent their Railleries, re&s;olv'd to come and acquaint His Maje&s;ty of it at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> believing the King would certainly reward him liberally; &s;o quitting his Charge, and leaving that Country expre&s;ly, he pa&s;&s;ed through all <HI>Germany,</HI> and arriving in <HI>Hol|land,</HI> came to the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ffler</HI>'s Army, upon the Frontiers of the <HI>Spani&s;h Flanders.</HI> The Officer of the main Guard having &s;topped him, was inform'd by him, who he was, whence he came, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure, of the nature of his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;ent him to the Mar&s;hal, to acquaint him of what he was not willing to declare there. This Stranger did not know one Word of <HI>French;</HI> but as he &s;poke <HI>Latin</HI> to perfection, he made the General ea&s;ily under&s;tand, That he came from <HI>Po|land,</HI> and that he had Affairs of moment, relating to that Country; and this is all he would tell him, as if the Mar&s;hal had not been worthy of his Secret. The General &s;eeing a Per&s;on of an ill mein, that pleaded nothing in his favour, but ra|ther gave him an ill opinion of him, was like to cau&s;e him to be taken up; but con&s;idering he would do better to &s;end him under a &s;ure Guard to Court, he put him into the hands of an Officer, whom he order'd to take two or three Troopers for his <HI>E&s;corte.</HI></P>
<P>The Officer went along with him to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> where this Man was reputed a Spy, as &s;oon as he offer'd to &s;peak: For after what the Abbot of <HI>Po|lignac</HI> had Wrote to them, they were fully per|&s;waded, that the Affairs of the Prince of <HI>Conty</HI> went as well as they could wi&s;h in that Country; they would not believe a tittle of what he alledg'd, it being quite contrary to <HI>Polignac</HI>'s Relation. He told the Secretary of State, to whom the Mar&s;hal had &s;ent him, That they were highly mi&s;taken, if they believ'd, that the <HI>Poles</HI> would ever chu&s;e that Prince for their King. They ask'd him the

rea&s;on; but he not being able to produce any o|ther than that I mention'd but now, it was reck|on'd &s;o bad a one, that he was immediately &s;ent to Pri&s;on. They were re&s;olv'd to draw up an In|dictment again&s;t him; but Mon&s;. <HI>D'Argen&s;on,</HI> who was employ'd to Try him, being a Man full of Ju&s;tice and Equity, had no &s;ooner examin'd him, but he found it plain, that all his Crime con&s;i&s;ted in having thought to make his Fortune, by bring|ing this News. He reported the &s;ame thing to the Court; and the Proce&s;s again&s;t this pretended Criminal, con&s;i&s;ting only of an Interrogatory or two, it was dropt, till they &s;aw how the Election of <HI>Poland</HI> would go.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> thought it convenient, in the mean time, to make a faint &s;how of the Catho|lick Religion, without having the lea&s;t inclination to it. He &s;aw that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for obtaining the Crown of <HI>Poland:</HI> &s;o having brought over to his Intere&s;t a Bi&s;hop of his own Family, that was of that Religion; this Prelate, at the Emperor's &s;ollicitation, gave him a Certificate, That he had privately Abjured <HI>Lutherani&s;m.</HI> This they &s;hewed &s;ecretly to the <HI>Palatines</HI> that were in the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Party, who &s;eem'd to have no other view in Corre&s;ponding with it, than to advance Prince <HI>James</HI>'s Election: At lea&s;t, the World be|liev'd &s;o, and <HI>France</HI> was of that opinion, &s;o that they did not dream that ever that Elector had thought in the lea&s;t of the Crown. The Queen of <HI>Poland</HI> was impos'd upon, as well as others; the <HI>Palatines</HI> delay'd Affairs on purpo&s;e, that they might be more courted, and have the opportunity of filling their Pur&s;es. The Elector was obliged to borrow Money from all hands, to forward his Intere&s;t. The Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> lent him con&s;iderable Sums upon a Mortgage of the <HI>Baillages</HI> that lay convenient for him. He like|wi&s;e rais'd immen&s;e Sums in his own Dominions,

upon the pretence that being in the Emperor's Ser|vice, he wanted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his own People, be|cau&s;e it was not po&s;&s;ible for the Emperor to pay the Sub&s;idies they had agreed upon. Moreover, in&s;tead of making his Corre&s;pondence with the Duke of <HI>Erandenburg</HI> to appear, he feign'd he was at variance with him, upon the account of the Domains that both of them had upon the Confines of <HI>Poland;</HI> and accordingly, both of them march'd thither their Troops, as if they de&s;ign'd imme|diately to come to a Rupture. <HI>France</HI> that had too many Enemies to deal with, to be indifferent in de&s;iring to get rid of at lea&s;t &s;ome part of 'em, was catch'd as well in this Snare, as in the former. They were willing to believe, that this would not fail to make a powerful diver&s;ion in their favour; and as it was impo&s;&s;ible for &s;ome part of the <HI>German</HI> Princes to be meer Spectators in the Dif|ferences of the&s;e two Princes, &s;o they expected a con&s;iderable ea&s;e upon each &s;ide.</P>
<P>The march of the&s;e Troops was very cunning|ly contriv'd, and di&s;prov'd with a witne&s;s, what had been publi&s;h'd a while ago, to the di&s;advan|tage of the <HI>Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</HI> Some would have it, that for many Years together that Family had been always Trick'd by <HI>France;</HI> and that by ob|&s;erving only their ordinary Cour&s;e, as if there had been none el&s;e more ready and &s;ure to for|ward their De&s;igns, they had &s;o degenerated from the Wi&s;dom and Greatne&s;s of <HI>Charles</HI> V. that all <HI>Europe</HI> had forgot them; but as they manag'd this Intrigue, that was contriv'd at <HI>Vienna,</HI> they were overjoy'd to know that <HI>France</HI> had lo&s;t its Preten|&s;ions to the <HI>Title.</HI></P>

that Lady, who had met with &s;o ill u&s;age from her own Dome&s;ticks, afforded al&s;o the following, which is extraordinary enough to plead for &s;ome place in the&s;e Annals. It appear'd to me &s;o uncommon, that I doubted for a long time, whether I &s;hould in&s;ert it. I was &s;en&s;ible, that among &s;o many certain Things as I here pre&s;ent you with, I ought not to run the ri&s;que of Writing any that I have rea|&s;on to &s;u&s;pect: In fine, this Matter has been con|firm'd to me by &s;o many Hands, that if I be de|ceiv'd, it mu&s;t be, becau&s;e they took plea&s;ure to impo&s;e upon me. I receiv'd &s;ix different Letters from <HI>Paris,</HI> that contain'd the &s;ame thing; &s;o that, after all the Precautions I us'd, I &s;uppo&s;e, that however extraordinary the Matter appears, it may be credited, after the enquiry I have made in it. In effect, if we &s;hould doubt of all the &s;urprizing Things <HI>Paris</HI> affords, we mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily doubt of all that happens there; for every Day produces &s;uch Accidents, as one would hardly believe without infallible Te&s;ti|mony.</P>
<P>A Girl was forc'd to profe&s;s, by the uncon|trolable Will of Parents, who by this means meant to take her off from the Inclinations &s;he had for a Per&s;on, they would not have her Marry; notwith&s;tanding &s;he was &s;hut up, &s;he always con|tinu'd a Re&s;pect for him, that troubled her ex|treamly, in the exerci&s;es of her new Profe&s;&s;ion. Her Lover, for his part, could never forget her; but having &s;een her put on the Habit, he ought to have laid a&s;ide all hopes of ever enjoying her. Yet being always tormented with his Pa&s;&s;ion, which was &s;o much the more violent, that while the Young Nun continu'd in the way of the World, &s;he gave him all the demon&s;trations of her E&s;teem that he could rea&s;onably de&s;ire; he robb'd his Father (a Rich Merchant) of Twenty thou&s;and Livres in Gold, Cloath'd him&s;elf in a Girl's Habit, and went
<PB N="102" REF="255">
to the Convent where &s;he was, after having hid him&s;elf for a whole Month in the City, pretend|ing to be Sick. His fir&s;t Compliment to the Con|vent was, That he was re&s;olv'd to become a Nun. He told 'em, he was come from the Country, and was the Daughter of Parents that had made a con&s;iderable E&s;tate by Trafficking; and having &s;hew'd his Trea|&s;ure to the&s;e Nuns, it &s;ecur'd him more in their e&s;teem, than any Profe&s;&s;ion what&s;oever.</P>
<P>So extream de&s;irous were they to have it, that they ea&s;ily di&s;penc'd with inquiring any farther after the place of her Nativity, or what Faults this di&s;guis'd Girl might be liable to in her Youth. They were &s;atisfy'd, for that &s;he promi&s;ed them the whole, provided they would Maintain her while &s;he Liv'd. However, &s;he told them, that they might not think &s;he was ill natur'd, That if &s;he meant to let them have the whole Sum, it was, becau&s;e &s;he had no Relations in <HI>France;</HI> That her Father and Mother, who had come thither, were origi|nally <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> And thus having told them a thou&s;and pretty Stories, at length &s;he concluded, That &s;he was a poor Orphan, and would be very glad to lay out her Money to the be&s;t advantage; or at lea&s;t, to &s;ecure her&s;elf from the Mi&s;eries of Nece&s;|&s;ity.</P>
<P>This Relation of the pretended Orphan appear'd &s;o ingenuous to the Hungry Nuns, that they re|&s;olv'd to receive her into their Cloy&s;ter, without troubling them&s;elves with any farther inquiry into her Circum&s;tances, than what their Eyes could afford them into the goodne&s;s of her Coin. How|ever, there aro&s;e a little difficulty betwixt the Parties; for the Nuns de&s;ir'd to have the Money pre&s;ently deliver'd up to them, or at lea&s;t, when &s;he a&s;&s;um'd the Habit; but &s;he, for her part, pre|tended only to do it when &s;he Profe&s;s'd; tho' &s;he meant never to do it; for &s;he de&s;ign'd her Mony for &s;ome other u&s;e than what the Nuns had ever
<PB N="103" REF="256">
thought of: And to that purpo&s;e told them, That &s;he could not be &s;atisfy'd, whether their Rules and manner of Life would &s;uit with her Temper, and till &s;he was fully a&s;&s;ured of that, they ought to demand no other Conditions of her, but that of paying hand&s;omly for her Board, which &s;he would never &s;cruple to do; that in the mean time, &s;he would put out her Money to Intere&s;t, which would fall to them in cour&s;e, whenever &s;he had a&s;&s;um'd the Profe&s;&s;ion; but that &s;he intended to &s;ecure her&s;elf before &s;he was &s;tripped of her Money. She de|manded nothing but what was ju&s;t; and be&s;ides, threaten'd to find out &s;ome other place, if they re|fu&s;ed any longer to accept of her Conditions. Being afraid to &s;lip the opportunity, they agreed with her upon her own Terms. So, this preten|ded young Gentlewoman, having put on the White Vail, in a few days, be&s;tow'd &s;o Li|berally upon her Habit, as if Money had co&s;t her nothing. All the Nuns were wonderfully edified by her genero&s;ity, only her Mi&s;tre&s;s, in the mid&s;t of all their Joy for &s;o rich a Prize, continued &s;till in her wonted indi&s;po&s;ition, as if &s;he had been altogether mortify'd. The re&s;em|blance &s;he found between her&s;elf and her Spark, open'd her Wounds afre&s;h, that were &s;till too tender, not to be &s;en&s;ible of any thing that touched them.</P>
<P>The Scene being thus over, The Novice be|gan &s;oon to acco&s;t the Lady that oblig'd him to di&s;&s;emble his Sex. But being unwilling to entertain her in the Torment &s;he was in, &s;he told her all of a &s;udden, what <HI>Love</HI> had forced her to do; &s;he added moreover, That &s;he was fully re&s;olv'd to Starve her&s;elf, if &s;he would &s;hew her no Compa&s;&s;ion; That &s;he was cer|tainly inform'd, &s;he had a&s;&s;um'd the Profe&s;&s;ion again&s;t her Inclination; and if &s;he had yet any &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had for her, while with her Parents, &s;he had no rea&s;on to doubt, but the

recent Te&s;timony &s;he now gave her, would en|gage her to enter into all the mea&s;ures &s;he would advi&s;e her; That &s;he had fallen upon this Inven|tion, not to rob her of her Honour, but to re&s;tore her to to the tranquility &s;he had lo&s;t, and to re|cover her own al&s;o; That &s;he could enjoy no more after &s;he had enter'd into the Convent; That &s;he wanted not Money to carry them thorow, in exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ctation of a better Fortune; and tho' the Sum was not of great importance, yet &s;he kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">w how to manage it to that advantage, as would &s;e|cure them from the Injuries of Nece&s;&s;ity; That &s;he was fully re&s;olv'd to Marry her, if &s;he pleas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d; That it was certain her Vows were of no force, &s;ince &s;he was compell'd to them, and &s;o it depended in|tirely upon her&s;elf, to be freed from her pre&s;ent Captivity, &s;ince it was not po&s;&s;ible for her to be happy without her; That neither of them ought to regard the meanne&s;s of the Pre&s;ent &s;he offer'd her now, in compari&s;on of what both of them could have rea&s;onably expected, if Love had not embroil'd them with their Parents; That &s;he would endeavour to be at ea&s;e without them, and of|tentimes there was more &s;atisfaction in a middle ordinary F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rtune, than in a &s;umptuous one; That great R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ches are always attended with great Cares, and provided that a Husband and Wife, who love one another tenderly, be out of the reach of Nece&s;&s;ity, they may be indifferent for other Super|fluities.</P>
<P>The Nun found this way of rea&s;oning very perti|nent&punc; it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eing altogether conformable to her own Sen&s;e and Inclination. She agreed with her Lover in all things. They pa&s;s'd three Months in this In|trigue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> doing nothing but what became the &s;tricte&s;t Honour, the there might have been &s;ome incroach|ments upon Decercy. The Novice feign'd her|&s;elf Sick alle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ging, (after they had asked her a great many times, What &s;he ail'd) That her Sick|ne&s;s
<PB N="105" REF="258">
proceeded only from the Au&s;terity of the Convent, which &s;he could never be able to go through. The Di&s;creet Mothers were a little vexed to hear her &s;peak after that rate, for&s;eeing that the twenty thou&s;and Livers they had rely'd upon, would &s;lip out of their Fingers; but there being no remedy, they were fain to re&s;tore to her her tem|poral Habit, and give her her Pa&s;s. She pre&s;ent|ly took up her Money, and gave it to the Ban|kers for Bills of Exchange upon <HI>Italy,</HI> where &s;he was re&s;olved to pa&s;s her time, as &s;oon as &s;he made &s;ure of her <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s.</HI> Having mutually adju&s;ted all things; the Night be|fore they put their Plot in Execution, the Nun uninter'd a Si&s;ter that had been ju&s;t Buried, carried her to her Bed, and having &s;et Fire to it, made her e&s;cape into the Garden of the Con|vent, where her Spark had fa&s;tned a Ladder of Cords to a certain place of the Wall they had conde&s;cended upon. He waited for her at the other &s;ide with a Coach, and receiving her into it, while the whole Convent was in an uproar about the Fire, carried her to a Lodging he had intirely at his command.</P>
<P>The poor Nuns had much to do to quench the Fire that frighted them extreamly, for fear of having their whole Convent de&s;troyed by it. However, having ma&s;tered it at length, tho' with a con&s;iderable lo&s;s, they all of them run immedi|ately to the Chamber where the Fire fir&s;t began, and being extreamly troubled that &s;he did not appear, they doubted not in the lea&s;t but &s;he had peri&s;hed in the Flames. They were &s;oon con|firm'd in the certainty of their belief, when they found the remnants of a dead Body in the ruins of that Chamber, thinking really the re&s;t had been con&s;umed by the Fire. Nothing was heard but Grief and Lamentation upon all hands; &s;ome re|hear&s;ing the prai&s;es of the dead Nun, whom they
<PB N="106" REF="259">
thought they could never lament &s;ufficiently. O|thers who were as much intere&s;s'd as compa&s;&s;io|nate, griev'd more for the lo&s;s of the Hou&s;e, than of the Dead; and while they amu&s;ed them|&s;elves with the&s;e or &s;uch like Reflections, not one of them dream'd of what had happen'd; but the mo&s;t probable thing they &s;aid, was, That her Pa|rents when acquainted with her unhappy Di&s;a&s;ter, mu&s;t needs Cen&s;ure them&s;elves, in regard they had forced her to a&s;&s;ume the Profe&s;&s;ion again&s;t her Inclination.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the two Lovers e&s;cap'd into <HI>Italy,</HI> pur&s;uant to their de&s;ign: There they were Marry'd, having met with a Prie&s;t to their Mind; or one perhaps &s;o tender of their Intere&s;t, as to ea&s;e a poor Girl of her Vows, without giving her the trouble of applying her&s;elf to any other Authority, than his own. The young Husband applied him&s;elf to Traffick, in which he was &s;o fortunate, as in twenty Years time, to make a con&s;iderable E&s;tate. In that time, Providence ble&s;&s;ed him with a numerous Off &s;pring; but at length he died in the five and fortieth Year of his Age. The Lady, who was much about the &s;ame Age, notwith&s;tanding the tender Love and Pro&s;perity of her Husband, being &s;till frighted with a check of Con&s;cience, re&s;olv'd upon a Journey to <HI>Rome,</HI> to obtain the <HI>Holy-Father</HI>'s Ab&s;olution for what &s;he had done. The <HI>Pope</HI> refu&s;ed it ab&s;o|lutely, without &s;he promi&s;ed faithfully to return to the Convent. She was extreamly unwilling to comply, in regard of the tender Affection &s;he had for her Children. In fine, preferring the tran|quility of her Con&s;cience to every thing, &s;he conquer'd all ob&s;tacles that would have hindred her, and promis'd His <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> to obey his Com|mand: She had a favourable Pa&s;&s;age by Sea into <HI>France,</HI> together with her whole Family, which &s;he carry'd along with her to <HI>Rome,</HI> to move
<PB N="107" REF="260">
His <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> to a Compa&s;&s;ion for them. When &s;he arrived at <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> &s;he took the way to <HI>Paris,</HI> concealing from the World, both Her|&s;elf, and her Affairs. She lodg'd &s;ome time <HI>In|cognito</HI> in the Suburbs of St. <HI>Germans,</HI> to di&s;po&s;e of her Family, before &s;he would withdraw into the Cloy&s;ter. And tho' &s;he had put her Affairs in order, &s;he would by no means go thither, before &s;he was a&s;&s;ured of a civil U&s;age. She was not ignorant of the terrible Penalty they were liable to, that leap'd over the Walls of the Con|vent, as &s;he had done. That &s;he &s;hould not be expo&s;ed to it, &s;he offered underhand, Twenty thou&s;and Livres for her Pardon. This Summ charmed all the Nuns Eyes, which they looked upon as a Pre&s;ent &s;ent them from Heaven. They were mightily &s;urprized at her Re&s;urrection, and acquainted her Friends with it, who doubted a long time, whether they ought to rejoice at it, or &s;hew her &s;ome Mark of their di&s;plea&s;ure, for wandring about the World, with a Per&s;on, upon who&s;e account &s;he had been forced to turn Nun. As it was never &s;een, that all the World was of the &s;ame Opinion, &s;o &s;ome continued their Indigna|tion again&s;t her, and would never &s;ee her; others did not mind the matter &s;o much: But all of 'em agreed to have her &s;tript of the Mony &s;he brought from <HI>Italy,</HI> pretending it was not in her power to di&s;po&s;e of it to her Children. She &s;ecured it in a Per&s;on's Hands whom &s;he had rea&s;on to con|fide in, to have it divided among&s;t her Children, whenever they &s;hould either Marry, or e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves &s;ome other way in the World. How|ever, they were not the only Per&s;ons who gaped after it; her decea&s;ed Husband's Friends began al&s;o to be&s;tir them&s;elves upon the news of what had pa&s;&s;ed. Both Parties commenced their Pro|ce&s;s again&s;t the Children, pretending to have them declared Ba&s;tards. So much for this extraordi|nary
<PB N="108" REF="261">
Scene, which, in effect, appeared in &s;uch a manner to me, that I &s;hould never have had the confidence to have mentioned it here, without hav|ing taken all imaginable Precautions with refe|rence to it. It is not very hard to conjecture what Deci&s;ion Ju&s;tice will make in it. However, it will hardly be &s;oon determined. The Judges are &s;eldom very prompt in deciding Cau&s;es, when the Parties are in Circum&s;tances to di&s;pen&s;e with Money. They believe it would derogate too much from their laudable Cu&s;tom, to di&s;patch readily Affairs that afford Gleanings.</P>
<P>The Court being about that time at <HI>Marli,</HI> the Count of <HI>Chamilly</HI> was nam'd among&s;t others to go thither. In a di&s;cour&s;e of the War, &s;ome young Gentlemen there took a &s;hare in the Conver|&s;ation: And the King ask'd the Count of <HI>Gram|mont,</HI> &s;oftly, how he liked the young Gentle|men's way of rea&s;oning. <HI>Grammont,</HI> who has a plea&s;ant freedom in all his Expre&s;&s;ions, being glad to make u&s;e of this opportunity to &s;erve the Count of <HI>Chamilly,</HI> who had been neglected for a con&s;iderable time, an&s;wer'd His Maje&s;ty, That he ought not to be &s;urpriz'd at the&s;e young Men's way of rea&s;oning; for if any were at the pains to ask them, if ever the <HI>Grave</HI> was Be&s;ieged, they would &s;ay nothing of what had pa&s;s'd there, nor who had defended the Place. The King perceiv'd his De&s;ign, which was to up|braid His Maje&s;ty, that after &s;o glorious an A|ction, <HI>Chamilly</HI> had not been rewarded as others had, who had not his merit to plead for them. But it is no &s;urprizing matter now a-days, to &s;ee Actions of Renown &s;hot in their Carier. Courage and Conduct doth not intitle a Man to a plentiful <HI>Fortune,</HI> he mu&s;t al&s;o be learn'd in the Art of <HI>Truckling</HI> to the <HI>Mini&s;ters.</HI> The Marquis of <HI>Louvois</HI> was extraordinary upon this account; and however highly he valued the <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Advantage</HI> of the <HI>State,</HI> which none
<PB N="109" REF="262">
could deny to him; yet to &s;erve the King faith|fully was no &s;ufficient Character to recommend one, unle&s;s he were his Creature: Without that nothing would do; it was his con&s;tant Maxim, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to be His <HI>Ma|je&s;ty</HI>'s Friend, without being the <HI>Mini&s;ters.</HI> I &s;hall neither ju&s;tifie nor condemn him; there is a great deal to be &s;aid on both &s;ides. His Ma|je&s;ty, who without di&s;pute, is the mo&s;t &s;incere and prudent Prince in the Univer&s;e, took this oc|ca&s;ion to do <HI>Chamilly</HI> all the ju&s;tice that could be expected. So that tho&s;e who were entirely Strangers to the Siege of the <HI>Grave,</HI> as the Count of <HI>Grammont</HI> pretended, might ea&s;ily be inform'd of all that pa&s;s'd there.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being alarm'd at the Preparations the King was making in <HI>Pro|vence,</HI> acquainted the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> afre&s;h of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, to the end they might &s;end their <HI>Fleet</HI> into the Mediterranean, to make Head again&s;t the King's. The&s;e two <HI>Powers,</HI> being full as weary of the War as <HI>His Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty,</HI> for that no advantage could accrue to them by continuing of it, amu&s;ed them from time to time with fair Promi&s;es, without troubling them&s;elves to per|form them. They thought it convenient to allow <HI>France</HI> to act its utmo&s;t Efforts upon that &s;ide, that the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> might become the more tractable, and oppo&s;e no more a <HI>Tranquility,</HI> of which all <HI>Europe</HI> &s;tood in need. The <HI>Pope</HI> made u&s;e of his Intere&s;t in vain, to draw over that <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> to it, &s;o great was their confidence, that <HI>France</HI> would at la&s;t be oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;o many Enemies as were United again&s;t it. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s falling off, gained nothing upon their ob&s;tinacy, tho' it ea&s;ed <HI>France</HI> very &s;en&s;ibly. The <HI>Pope</HI> could never offer his Mediation to decide the Quarrel, mo&s;t of the Parties intere&s;&s;ed, being of another Religion. In fine, the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> King accom|pli&s;hed
<PB N="110" REF="263">
what His Holine&s;s could never bring to pa&s;s. He made the <HI>Parties</HI> agree to accept of him, as <HI>Mediator</HI> of their <HI>Differences.</HI> The Ca|&s;tle of <HI>Ry&s;wick</HI> was named for the <HI>Place</HI> of their Congre&s;s, tho' the Emperor oppo&s;ed it upon &s;e|veral accounts. They endeavoured to accommo|date Matters in an amicable way, which was ex|ceeding hard to do, con&s;idering the Exorbitant De|mands of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> The&s;e in&s;i&s;ted always upon the Re&s;titution of all they had lo&s;t &s;ince the Treaty of the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> and had no re|gard to the two later Treaties of <HI>Aix-la Chapel,</HI> and <HI>Nimiguen;</HI> alledging, They had only been obliged to make them, by a &s;uperior <HI>Force,</HI> to a|void the utter De&s;olation of their <HI>States.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> for his part, demanded the Re|&s;titution of his <HI>Domains,</HI> without any regard to the Conditions that were agreed upon by the Treaty of <HI>Nimiguen;</HI> which &s;eemed &s;o in&s;upportable to his Father, that he cho&s;e rather never to enter into the Treaty, than accept of them upon the&s;e Terms. A great many other Princes came al&s;o to thwart it, who demanded Reparation of the King for a great many Places and Villages, that they alledg'd, he had dive&s;ted them of; in&s;omuch, that <HI>His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty</HI> might have been compared to the Bird in the Fable, from which all the other Birds (his Enemies) meant to pluck a Feather.</P>
<P>It had been very hard to redre&s;s all the&s;e Con|fu&s;ions, if the common Mi&s;ery had not obliged the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> to remove the Diffi|culty; it had like to have proved a Gordian-Knot, where the Sword is more nece&s;&s;ary than Art. But as the&s;e two <HI>Powers,</HI> to &s;peak properly, were the very <HI>Life</HI> of the Alliance, that had no motion, but from this <HI>Spring;</HI> they asked the <HI>French</HI> Ple|nipotentiaries at <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> if they meant to &s;tand to the Preliminaries that were &s;tipulated with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Calliers;</HI> otherwi&s;e, it were to no pur|po&s;e
<PB N="111" REF="264">
to Meet; but if they intended faithfully to perform what was agreed upon, they would &s;oon remove all other ob&s;tacles. The&s;e <HI>Preliminaries</HI> were of no le&s;s con&s;equence, than the Re&s;titu|tion of two intire Provinces, and of one <HI>Place</HI> of equal importance to all the re&s;t. The&s;e two <HI>Powers</HI> doubted, that <HI>Calliers</HI> had made the&s;e ad|vances of his own Head, that he might with the greater facility, di&s;cover their Preten&s;ions; but his Colleagues having a&s;&s;ured them it was the King's &s;incere Intention, they went on with the Treaty, in &s;uch a manner, as the World might perceive, they meant to bring it to a happy Con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Court of <HI>France</HI> increas'd in the number of Subjects, by the <HI>Conque&s;ts</HI> it made during the cour&s;e of the War, tho it had to do with &s;o many Enemies, as one would have thought were &s;ufficient to bring it to De&s;olation. No|thing but Coaches was to be &s;een at <HI>Ver&s;ailles;</HI> &s;ome of them with the Ornaments peculiar to the Electors of the Empire; and that was become &s;o fa&s;hionable, that even the <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves had them &s;et upon theirs. However, the better &s;ort of Men de&s;pi&s;ed it, &s;eeing no apparent rea|&s;on, why they were &s;o ready to imitate the Cu|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oms of the Empire; for if His Maje&s;ty had firmly pretended to it, he was &s;o far from it now, that there was not the lea&s;t appearance of his ar|riving to it. However, there were &s;ome of the&s;e Gentlemen who had a ju&s;t Title to carry them; particularly the Count of <HI>Egmont,</HI> who Married Madamoi&s;elle <HI>De Conac,</HI> the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Aix</HI>'s Niece, His Maje&s;ty conferr'd the Honours of the <HI>Louvre</HI> upon her: And the&s;e were ju&s;tly due to her, becau&s;e her Husband was Lineally De&s;cended of the Dukes of <HI>Ghelderland,</HI> which created to her a great deal of envy among&s;t the other Ladies of Quality; in&s;omuch, that the Mare&s;chal <HI>d'E&s;tree</HI>'s
<PB N="112" REF="265">
Lady could not di&s;&s;emble her Re&s;entment of it. One day at Dinner with Mon&s;. <HI>Pontchartrain,</HI> &s;he &s;aid, without regarding if any there would re&s;ent her di&s;cour&s;e, She admir'd, that the Count of <HI>Egmont</HI> would conde&s;cend to Marry &s;uch a Girl as Madamoi&s;elle <HI>Conac.</HI> The Chevalier <HI>d'Obtere,</HI> Governor of <HI>Couelloure,</HI> over-heard her, and be|ing Uncle to the young Gentlewoman, could not avoid being concern'd at it. He told the Gentleman who &s;at next him, How unbecoming it was for <HI>Morin</HI> the <HI>Jew</HI>'s Daughter, to talk after that man|ner, of a Per&s;on of his Niece's Quality: that he own'd the Honour the Alliance had done both to her and all her Friends: but great as it was, it fail'd of that the <HI>Morins</HI> had by the Blood of the <HI>E&s;trees;</HI> that the difference was not &s;o great between the <HI>Egmonts</HI> and the <HI>Conacs,</HI> as betwixt the <HI>Etrees</HI> and the Burge&s;&s;es of the City of <HI>Tours.</HI> All the Company expected, that the Chevalier would not fail to re&s;ent it after that manner; and knowing that the Lady was ignorant of the Chevalier's Intere&s;t in Madamoi&s;elle, they continu'd the Conver&s;ation upon the &s;ame &s;ubject with her, that &s;he might avoid a &s;econd over&s;ight. Then &s;he became &s;en&s;ible of her fault, and of the pri|vate reproof they gave her; but whether &s;he had done it, becau&s;e &s;he knew him not, or through im|prudence, &s;he never made him any acknowledge|ment of it.</P>
<P><HI>Lent</HI> follow'd &s;oon after, and a certain Monk, nam'd <HI>Seraphin,</HI> Guardian of the <HI>Capucins</HI> at <HI>Meudon,</HI> was cho&s;en to Preach before the King that Sea&s;on; he behav'd him&s;elf with &s;uch free|dom, that it was generally believ'd he would be forbid the Pulpit; but His Maje&s;ty was &s;o intent upon his Devotion, as &s;ome alledge, out of a principle of Chri&s;tianity, in favour of the <HI>Peace,</HI> that he overlook'd a great many things, which at any other time he would have maintain'd with
<PB N="113" REF="266">
the point of his Sword: I &s;ay, His Maje&s;ty, who honours all Men of Probity, was &s;o far from be|ing offended at it, that he own'd, nothing pleas'd him more than his Sermons, and de&s;ir'd him to continue them after the &s;ame manner, nor did the King ever neglect any of them; but perceiving that the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut</HI> never came to them, he ask'd him the rea&s;on. The Duke re|ply'd, That he had no Seat in the Church. His Maje&s;ty conferr'd the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Orlean</HI>'s, his fir&s;t Almoner's Seat upon him, the Bi&s;hop being then at his Cathedral, two days journey from <HI>Paris,</HI> whence returning very &s;oon, he de|&s;ir'd to have his Seat again; the Duke refus'd it, pretending he never had it but out of Decen|cy; and now His Maje&s;ty conferring it upon him, he meant to &s;hut him out of it. This difference made no le&s;s noi&s;e than Mon&s;ieur <HI>Boleau</HI>'s Lu|trin. Both parties were back'd by their Friends in their preten&s;ions, and if they dur&s;t to have fought for it, they were &s;ufficiently animated again&s;t each other to have done it; but re&s;ting &s;atisfied to &s;hew, that they were both Men of Spirit, they turn'd their Indignation to &s;ollicite His Maje&s;ty, that he would be pleas'd to decide the cau&s;e in favour of the re&s;pective Party.</P>
<P>The King gave it for the Duke, which vex'd the Prelate to that degree, that, out of &s;pite, he return|ed to his Dioce&s;s. He carried the Abbot of <HI>Coa&s;lin</HI> along with him, as if, by that, he meant to engage him in his Re&s;entment. This Abbot had the &s;urvivor&s;hip of the Prelate's Charge, as fir&s;t Almoner, and the expectation of the fir&s;t Bi&s;hoprick &s;hould fall: Be&s;ides, his Uncle had no rea&s;on to complain of the favours of the Court. After the Death of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Chanvallon,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> the King had awarded him his nomination for a Cardinal's Cap, which he had formerly gratified the Archbi&s;hop with.
<PB N="114" REF="267">
So that neither of them could be excus'd from im|prudence, that &s;hew'd &s;o much Pa&s;&s;ion, for &s;o &s;mall a cau&s;e.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, his Brother, the Duke of <HI>Coa&s;lin</HI> had another kind of Vexation that &s;eem'd to be better grounded than theirs: His Coach was Arre&s;ted for Debt, which the Advo|cate, <HI>Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Regi&s;ter of the Points of Honour,</HI> before the Mare&s;chals of <HI>France,</HI> al|ledg'd was unduly done, becau&s;e of his Dignity. Some years ago, he made a great deal of noi&s;e about it, in favour of the Duke of <HI>Ventadour,</HI> who &s;uffer'd the &s;ame Affront; but as he was far inferior in Wit and Reputation to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pom|ponne,</HI> his Brother-in-law, after he had been cru|&s;hed in the Defence he undertook in <HI>Ventadour</HI>'s Affair, he never dar'd to appear in defence of <HI>Coa&s;lin.</HI> He was e'en ready to lay down his Charge before the Mare&s;chals of <HI>France,</HI> which made him the more wary of engaging into new Troubles, for fear of ending as he had begun.</P>
<P>Tho' this was &s;ome Mortification for the Duke, to be oblig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> to Walk home a-foot, yet about the &s;ame time, a more pre&s;&s;ing Vexation afflict|ed the Dutche&s;s or <HI>Svlly;</HI> for the Prince&s;s of <HI>Fur&s;temberg</HI> caus'd to &s;eize both her Bed and Furniture, for her Rent: tho' &s;he had run only three Years in Arrear, there being thirteen Years Rent due at the Death of the Duke her Hu&s;|band, of which the Dutche&s;s had clear'd ten, &s;ince &s;he was a Widow: But there being a mi&s;under|&s;tanding between them, and the Prince&s;s alledging, that the Dutche&s;s had &s;poke with more freedom than decency of her, when her Husband had been Wounded at Hunting, &s;he laid hold of this op|portunity, to make her repent of her imprudence. The&s;e two Affairs were repre&s;ented to the King, to kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">w if his Maje&s;ty would exempt the Duke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">, or reduce the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o their

immovables. But His Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer gave them &s;mall encouragement; he reply'd, That eve|ry one was concern'd to pay their Debts; and tho he did not approve of &s;ome procceedings, yet it was &s;ufficient that they were &s;creen'd by Ju|&s;tice.</P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Lude</HI>'s intere&s;t had bet|ter &s;ucce&s;s for the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Vernevil,</HI> her Mo|ther. The King conferr'd a Pen&s;ion of Twelve thou&s;and Livres upon her, which &s;he had almo&s;t refus'd, reputing it too mean for a Per&s;on of her Rank. For as &s;he had the honour to be the Wi|dow of the King's Uncle, &s;he thought it her due to be treated as a Prince&s;s of the Blood, tho' the advantage he boa&s;ted of, came<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Left-hand. His Maje&s;ty &s;eldom gave them le&s;s than Twenty thou&s;and Livres, and &s;he thought it was none of her bu&s;ine&s;s to accept of &s;o little, con&s;idering what others receiv'd, who could not come in competiton with her. In effect, the Count of <HI>Brancas</HI> enjoy'd Fourteen thou&s;and Livres for his Life; and after his Death, His Maje&s;ty continu'd it to the Prince&s;s of <HI>Harcourt,</HI> his elde&s;t Daughter. A great many others had al&s;o larger Pen&s;ions than her's, which vex'd her to that degree, that &s;he told her Daugh|ter, She meant to re&s;ign it again freely to the King. The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Lude,</HI> not thinking it convenient for her to re&s;ent after this manner the Fir&s;t-fruits of her favour, di&s;&s;waded her from it; for it is His Maje&s;ty's Prerogative to give, and not to receive Laws.</P>
<P>About that time, the only Son of the Mar|quis of <HI>Gordes,</HI> pre&s;ented a Petition to the King, that vex'd the Marquis of <HI>Rhodes</HI> much more than his Gout, which afflicted him for many Years. The Marquis of <HI>Rhodes</HI> had married the other Si&s;ter: He was no &s;uch Game&s;ter as his Father; but had a much lighter Head: For, had he been on|ly a Game&s;ter, the Bi&s;hop had pardon'd him, for
<PB N="116" REF="269">
in that he had been of his own Kidney; but the Prelate thinking him &s;omewhat maddi&s;h, cau&s;es him to be &s;hut up in a Convent. This poor Gentle|man believ'd that the Bi&s;hop had impos'd upon His Maje&s;ty in the Affair, and thought he could ea&s;ily per&s;wade the King of the contrary, had he the honour to &s;ee him; but as Fools do not think they are &s;o, or rather believe they are the wi&s;e&s;t of Men, if you credit their Oath: The King did not think it convenient to tru&s;t him: He was afraid to be deceiv'd, as he had been late|ly by a Num-&s;cul, who had e&s;cap'd out of the <HI>Ba&s;tille,</HI> where his Friends had &s;hut him up upon the &s;ame account. He was a Cadet of the Hou&s;e of <HI>U&s;ez,</HI> but &s;o little reform'd by his Impri&s;onment, that immediately upon his e&s;cape he committed the height of Folly in marrying very mi&s;erably. He cho&s;e a Woman that was neither Rich, Young, nor Hand&s;ome, and for an additional comfort, the Widow of a <HI>Common Fellow,</HI> that became a Gentleman only at his Death; for they did him the favour to cut his Throat in con&s;ideration of his Wife, who was more hone&s;tly de&s;cended; for had they treated him according to his merit, they were affraid &s;he might lye under the imputation of the Wife of a Man that was Hang'd. But his Folly did not &s;top there, for he carried her a|long with him to <HI>Ver&s;ails</HI> and St. <HI>Cloud,</HI> where he had reviv'd the <HI>Angels</HI> that had died a long time before. But as People have &s;ometimes more plea|&s;ure in Fools than in Wi&s;e Men, every one di|&s;turb'd his Brain the more, in making him believe they delighted in his Folly.</P>
<P>Much about that time, there happen'd a quar|rel betwixt two Per&s;ons of Quality at St. <HI>Cloud,</HI> who treated one another after the rate of true <HI>Billing&s;gate.</HI> Their Sex excus'd them from the u&s;e of the Sword, to decide it, but being equal|ly provided with the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ms of the Sex, they fair|ly
<PB N="117" REF="270">
di&s;puted for the Victory. The one was Prin|ce&s;s of <HI>Montaban,</HI> and the other Madam of <HI>Gra|ncei.</HI> At la&s;t, both having &s;pent their Spirits in the Controver&s;ie, without the lea&s;t re&s;pect to one anothers reputation, Madam of <HI>Grancie</HI> appeal'd to Mon&s;ieur&mdash;who was pre&s;ent, to decide their Difference. The Prince&s;s accepted freely of the motion, and having call'd him that minute, intreated him to judge the Affair impartially. He gave thim an attentive hearing, but after both of them had taken the pains to &s;et forth their Cau&s;e, he made an&s;wer, That he di&s;charged the Proce&s;s. They ask'd him in a grumbling way, what he meant? But the an&s;wer he made them, &s;hock'd them more than all that went before. He reply'd, That he had no other Sentence to give to &s;uch people as them, and all they offer'd was as light as Wind. They could never get him to give another Rea&s;on, which made them re&s;olve upon a mutual Accommodation, without giving any body any further trouble upon the matter.</P>
<P>This gave great joy to the Judge, who finding them afterwards in a good under&s;tanding with one another, acco&s;ted them in this manner, <HI>I told you</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>That the Sentence I pronounced, was the only one that could be given among&s;t &s;uch People as you: Women of your Quality quarrel and agree again with equal facility; and unle&s;s a Lover be in the ca&s;e, there is no fear of an Acco|modation.</HI> Had the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> who loves Novelty, been cho&s;en Judge of their Difference, he had po&s;&s;ibly decided it rather in favour of the one than the other. Tho' he had formerly &s;ome inclinations for Madan <HI>Grancie,</HI> he thought now, that her Face wrinkled with Age, was not to be put in competition with the Charms of the Prince&s;s of <HI>Montauban.</HI> This Lady made him Laugh when he had no mind to it; &s;he inherited
<PB N="118" REF="271">
from her Ance&s;tors, a Genius for Comedy, for &s;he was Daughter to the Count of <HI>Nogent,</HI> and Si&s;ter to the Chevalier of <HI>Nogent,</HI> who is &s;till alive, and who&s;e only Trade, &s;ince he left the War, was to make the Marquis of <HI>Louvois</HI> laugh. This Mini&s;ter had him along with him in his own Cola&s;h, in all his Journies; nor was he the on|ly per&s;on who lov'd to divert him&s;elf with Childi&s;h Expre&s;&s;ions; for Mon&s;ieur <HI>Colbert</HI> at his lei&s;ure Hours, had al&s;o People to entertain him with ridiculous Stories. It's pity but Madam <HI>D'Anoy,</HI> and Madam <HI>de Moral,</HI> had thought at that time of diverting him with their Fairies; they had been often very acceptable. Thus you &s;ee great Men have their weak &s;ide as well as others; and there is nothing that convinces us more of the frailty of humane Nature.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> found in the Prince&s;s of <HI>Montauban</HI>'s Conver&s;ation, made him re&s;olve to carry her along with him to <HI>Marly.</HI> All are not free to go thither, and it mu&s;t be by Stratagem that leave is obtain'd to go; for after the King is earne&s;tly &s;ollicited, he reckons it a par|ticular Favour to grant it, as in effect it is, to go where the Prince goes, and to appear before him in a place where there is no confu&s;ion to be &s;een, tho' it prevails in other places where the Court comes. The Duke's expectation was fru&s;trated, for His Maje&s;ty refus'd his Reque&s;t. However, the Duke not being much di&s;courag'd at the fir&s;t Repul&s;e, in&s;i&s;ted in his demand, ho|ping to obtain it at la&s;t by his importunity. At la&s;t &s;eeing His Maje&s;ty inexorable, he intreated him at lea&s;t to impart his Rea&s;on. No doubt tho' the King, who always goes upon good grounds, had a very plau&s;ible Rea&s;on, but &s;u&s;pecting it might prove di&s;obliging to the Prince&s;s, he de&s;ir'd, in a &s;miling way, to be excus'd from a thing he had re&s;olv'd not to tell. The Duke, who is always
<PB N="119" REF="272">
very pre&s;&s;ing in what he undertakes, ob&s;erving that the King had only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">old him &s;o in a &s;miling way, importun'd His Maje&s;ty more than ever to know his Rea&s;on. His Maje&s;ty to be freed from his importunity, at la&s;t made him an&s;wer, That becau&s;e he was &s;o very earne&s;t, he would tell him freely; That he was always well pleas'd to &s;ee hand&s;ome Women, and the Prince&s;s of <HI>Mon|tauban</HI> being none of the number, he would not accu&s;tom his Eyes to look upon her. In effect, &s;he was very far from being Hand&s;ome. Her Face was mark'd with &s;cars from her Infancy; &s;he was Hunch'd Back'd, but found the &s;ecret to con|ceal it in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by the help of Steel Bodies; be&s;ides, being &s;omewhat advanc'd in Years, &s;he was the more in&s;upportable. How|ever, being &s;till as Hand&s;ome in the Duke's Opini|on, as a great many other Women whom His Maje&s;ty Honour'd with the &s;ame Favour, he &s;till pleaded on her behalf. He ask'd His Ma|je&s;ty if &s;he was not as Hand&s;ome as &s;uch and &s;uch Ladies whom he always carried along with him to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Marly.</HI> The King fell a Laughin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">g when he &s;aw his Brother take it &s;o pa|tiently, and left him to continue his Di&s;cour&s;e which tended only to per&s;wade him, that the La|dies which he mentioned, had no better Title to &s;uch marks of di&s;tinction than &s;he, for whom he was pleading; for he made him no other an&s;|wer than what he told him at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Madam <HI>de Montauban</HI> re&s;olving to go to <HI>Ver|&s;ailles</HI> at any rate; and &s;eeing all the Duke's Endeavours prove Fruitle&s;s, thought of a more plau&s;ible pretext. She applied her&s;elf to the Prince&s;s of <HI>Harcourt,</HI> who had the &s;ecret of ob|taining a great many things, when others met with a refu&s;al. Five hundred Crowns brought her Project to bear; and by the&s;e means &s;he had the Honour to go to <HI>Marly,</HI> an Honour &s;he had
<PB N="120" REF="273">
a&s;pir'd to of a long time, and which was like to have co&s;t her her <HI>Wits,</HI> if &s;he had not obtain'd it. The King was well enough pleas'd with the grant he had made; he found her very plea&s;ant and good Humour'd; and this Lady, who never knew what t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> was to fa&s;t <HI>Fridays</HI> or <HI>Saturdays,</HI> found it no difficulty to comply with what others did there. In effect, finding her&s;elf in a place where the King never allow'd any one to eat Fle&s;h, She out of Love to His Maje&s;ty, or out of Fear to di&s;plea&s;e him, did, what neither the Love nor Fear of God were ever capable to oblige her to do. But every per&s;on there knowing her ordi|nary practice in that Affair, &s;he thought it con|venient to vindicate her&s;elf to tho&s;e who were highly offended at the difference &s;he made be|twixt a mortal Man and God. But all &s;he &s;aid had rather more Gallantry in it than real Apo|logy. She could &s;ay nothing, but that the Food there, had a ta&s;te very different from the Food of the re&s;t of Mankind; that the Beams of the Sun of <HI>France</HI> created another kind of warmth than the ordinary Sun, in&s;omuch, that there was a certain happine&s;s under his influence, that was not to be found any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>But this &s;ort of Di&s;cour&s;e produc'd a quite dif|ferent effect from what &s;he expected; for tho&s;e who blam'd her before, condemn'd her much more now. They thought it had been much more proper for her (as no doubt it was) to have avoided all manner of Apology, than to make u&s;e of that &s;he made: For as they maintain'd very well, it was an adding of impiety to the &s;candal, to attribute more power to a Man than to God; but &s;he &s;uffered them to go on, being &s;ure to have the wanton Youths on her &s;ide; for 'tis at Court as at other places, they divert them&s;elves often with ridiculous Trifles; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">e&s;t and mo&s;t P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ous are not always the

mo&s;t re&s;pected. This appear'd too evidently not long after in a difference &s;he had with her Husband. He came to Court alone, while her entry was accompanied with a numerous Train of all &s;orts of people, &s;hewing by that means the re&s;pect they had for her. Hence &s;he took occa&s;ion to in&s;ult over him, as if his Solitude had given him an aver&s;ion to innocent Mirth. But he reply'd &s;o &s;martly home, that &s;he would gladly have di|&s;pen&s;ed with the &s;evere Compliment &s;he oblig'd him to return. They found what he &s;aid was &s;omewhat extraordinary, e&s;pecially of one de&s;|cended of a Family that never had the Reputa|tion of being over Witty; for he was the Son of the Duke of <HI>Montba&s;on,</HI> whom they had &s;hut up in a Convent for his giddy Brain, at lea&s;t, that was all the Rea&s;on they gave for dive&s;ting him of his E&s;tate, tho' in good earne&s;t they would be oblig'd to build more <HI>Bedlams</HI> than one, if they meant to &s;hut up all that are many degrees greater Num &s;culls than he.</P>
<P>Debauchery was &s;till in vogue among&s;t the Women, and con&s;equently among&s;t the Men; ho' the King omitted nothing that could be done to oblige all People to a ju&s;t ob&s;ervance of their Duty. The <HI>Italian</HI> Comedians, who had a dexterity of Acting every thing happily, took thence an occa&s;ion of introducing &s;o many in|decencies upon their Stages, that 'twas complain|ed of to His Maje&s;ty. This di&s;pleas'd him the more, that they publi&s;hed an Adverti&s;ement of repre&s;enting very &s;oon a per&s;on of Quality. Therefore His Maje&s;ty expell'd them out of the Kingdom; and for a long time he was indifferent as to the Play; and if at any time he order'd them to act before him, it was rather to amu&s;e the young People, or through policy, than for any plea&s;ure he him&s;elf took in it. In effect, it is convenient to keep the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> in Action, and &s;ome
<PB N="122" REF="275">
people allow even of a le&s;&s;er evil to obviate a greater. Tho' I hardly believe that the Gentle|men of <HI>Port Royal</HI> would be of that Opinion, were they con&s;ulted in it; and among&s;t all the Ca&s;ui&s;ts, we &s;hall never find any rea&s;onable pre|tence, that can warrant us to commit any evil. However, His Maje&s;ty had no &s;ooner form'd this Re&s;olution, than he &s;ent Mon&s;ieur <HI>D'Argen&s;on</HI> to &s;hut up their <HI>Theater.</HI> Accordingly he went im|mediately before they could have the lea&s;t in|telligence of the Storm that threatned them, and call'd a great many Commi&s;&s;aries to attend him; not that he fear'd any Rebellion; but in regard the King commanded him to go about it with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity: For the Scandal they had given being publick, the King would have their Puni&s;hment to be the &s;ame. Be&s;ides, he com|manded to &s;eal up all their Seats. He knew they had kept their Manu&s;cripts in them, and therefore would make &s;ure of all they had given Adverti&s;ements of. They were extreamly &s;ur|pri&s;ed at this manner of U&s;age, and the more, in that they had never dream'd of it. They went all in a Body to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> to pro&s;titute them|&s;elves at His Maje&s;ty's Feet; they repre&s;ented to him, how they were call'd, before they came to <HI>France,</HI> which was matter of fact; for Car|dinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> who him&s;elf was the greate&s;t Comedian in the Univer&s;e, and, perhaps, was afraid to forget a part he had Acted all his days, de&s;ir'd from time to time, to &s;ee &s;ome new Scenes to put him in mind of his Trade. Upon this &s;core they alledg'd, That having left their Coun|try upon that invitation, it was an inju&s;tice done to them at that time, to turn 'em out of the Na|tion. But the King fore&s;eeing what they aim'd at, prevented them, &s;aying, he doubted not but it was to plea&s;e Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> they under|took that Journey; and if they pleas'd to own
<PB N="123" REF="276">
the truth, they had no rea&s;on to repent of their Trouble: They came into <HI>France</HI> a Foot, and were in a condition to go out of it in a Coach. This Reply gave them to under&s;tand, that His Maje&s;ty was Di&s;pleas'd; therefore they thought to make their Application to &s;ome good Patron, to appea&s;e him; but whether it was, that every one was more ready to abandon them, than pro|tect them, becau&s;e they had &s;pared no body up|on their <HI>Theater;</HI> or that the Courtiers were &s;en|&s;ible the King had no inclination to &s;hew them any favour; not one per&s;on was found to plead for them: They were therefore oblig'd to look out for &s;ome other Trade for their future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and their <HI>Theater</HI> continues &s;hut up till this day.</P>
<P>In the mean time the King's Army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> laid Seige to <HI>Ath,</HI> a place His Maje&s;ty had given up to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by the Treaty of <HI>Nimiguen.</HI> The Count <HI>de Rheux</HI> commanded within the Town with a good Garri&s;on, among&s;t whom were a great many <HI>French</HI> De&s;erters, who looking up|on them&s;elves lo&s;t if they came to be known, de&s;ir'd to have the charge of the principal attacks. In all appearance they would choo&s;e rather to be cut to pieces than to &s;urrender. But the Count of <HI>Rheux</HI> con&s;idering they might al&s;o deliver up the Po&s;t, in expectation of a Pardon, was &s;o far from tru&s;ting or uniting them in one Body, as they de&s;ir'd, that he di&s;per&s;ed them among&s;t the different Regiments to avoid the pre|&s;ent Con&s;equences he fear'd. There were three Mar&s;hals of <HI>France</HI> in that Army, namely, the Mar&s;hal of <HI>Vlileroy,</HI> the Mar&s;hal of <HI>Boufflers,</HI> and the Mar&s;hal of <HI>Catinat;</HI> but this la&s;t being beyond di&s;pute, the greate&s;t of the three, it was to him the King gave the Direction of the Siege. <HI>Villeroy</HI> and <HI>Boufflers</HI> made head again&s;t the Ene|mies Army, which was jointly commanded by King <HI>William</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> But
<PB N="124" REF="277">
if the&s;e two Princes made any motion, it was not to run any ri&s;que; for they were &s;en&s;ible all their attempts would prove in vain. The Trea|ty of <HI>Re&s;wick</HI> was going on a pace, and knowing very well that the King would be oblig'd to give up that Place by the Peace, they did not think it convenient to Sacrifice one Man for its relief. If they had no mind to venture a Battle, they might ea&s;ily lay Siege to <HI>Dinant,</HI> while Mar&s;hal <HI>de Catinat</HI> was bu&s;ied at <HI>Ath.</HI> But then <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> that was Bumbarded the Year before, was left expos'd for <HI>Villeroy</HI> and <HI>Boufflers</HI> to Be&s;iege; &s;o that they could not conveniently quit their Po&s;t. Be&s;ides, they knew that <HI>Ath</HI> was one of the places the Plenipotentaries of <HI>France</HI> offer'd to give up to the Allies. It had been therefore very needle&s;s for them to throw away the lives of Men upon that de&s;ign, &s;ince they were &s;ure of ha|ving it without &s;troak of Sword.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons oblig'd them to keep their Sta|tions; or if they mov'd at any time, it was only to find a Camp where their Troops could be &s;upplied more conveniently with all nece&s;&s;aries. By that means Mar&s;hal <HI>de Catinat</HI> found little difficulty in his Enterprize. The Count <HI>de Reux,</HI> for his part, was prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd as well as King <HI>William</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> with a de&s;ign of husbanding his Men, it being his Intere&s;t as well as the King's. In&s;omuch that there was hardly any &s;hooting from the Town; nor was there ever a Siege where the Be&s;ieged made le&s;s noi&s;e. The <HI>French</HI> were extreamly a&s;toni&s;h'd at it; and the Governor having &s;urrendred, &s;aid in a merry mode, to the Ho&s;tages, who were &s;ent to make the Capitulation, that it mu&s;t be own|ed the <HI>French</HI> are very bad Husbands, con&s;idering how poor they were &s;aid to be, for that they had lavi&s;hed many thou&s;and weight of Powder be|fore that Place, and yet he was ready to hold,
<PB N="125" REF="278">
if they pleas'd, five hundred Pi&s;toles to a Pen|ny, that in le&s;s than four Months time the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would enter the place, without being at the expence of one grain of Powder. The&s;e Ho&s;tages were not ignorant of his meaning, and could hardly avoid condemning their own Folly. They own'd they were very much to blame, to throw away &s;o many Lives upon a place with|out the lea&s;t expectation of any Advantage. Not that they had lo&s;t any Per&s;on of Con&s;equence, nor, indeed, &s;o many Common Soldiers as was at fir&s;t alledg'd; but what they &s;poke was with regard to the in&s;ignificancy of that Conque&s;t; for as few as they were, it was &s;till a greater lo&s;s than nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince their Blood ought to have been valued.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Vendome,</HI> for his part, Be&s;ieged <HI>Barcelona,</HI> both by Sea and Land; tho' he had acquainted His Maje&s;ty, that he was in no Cir|cum&s;tances to do it, yet being commanded by a &s;upreme Order, he was oblig'd to undertake it a|gain&s;t his Inclination. It was never known that any place was inve&s;ted; after &s;uch a manner; for he had not Troops enough to make the Cir|cumvallation. So that the Be&s;ieged had always opportunity to keep a Communication with the <HI>Vice Roy</HI> of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> who took the Field in or|der to relieve them. The Duke of <HI>Vendome;</HI> to &s;upply his want of Men, took out of the King's Ships that were before the Town, all who were able to carry Arms. This added &s;omewhat to his Force, but not &s;ufficiently to compleat his Circumvallation: So that all the World believ'd he had engag'd in an Enterprize, which would cerrainly co&s;t him his Honour. In effect, be&s;ides that the Be&s;ieged could depart and enter the Town at liberty, they were &s;o numerous, that one would have thought it was rather an Army than a Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;on. They had eleven Thou&s;and Men
<PB N="126" REF="279">
in the place; and the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> being in hopes of pre&s;erving it for her Nephew, recom|mended it in particulor to the Prince of <HI>Arm&s;tadt,</HI> who, next to the Governor, had the principal Command. He promis'd Her Maje&s;ty confident|ly to behave him&s;elf &s;o, as &s;he &s;hould have no rea|&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied; and to make good his Promi&s;e, there pa&s;s'd very few days withou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> making &s;ome Sallies, which extreamly retarded the advancing of the Works. They di&s;puted every Inch of Ground with 'em; and the World was ready to believe, That as the Arms of <HI>France</HI> had gain'd &s;ome Reputation at the taking of <HI>Ath,</HI> their Glory was like to be ob&s;cur'd by a far different Event before this place; and for an additional misfortune, the News from <HI>Poland</HI> gave them rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the Abbot of <HI>Polignac</HI> had acted too precipitantly in declaring the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> King; for all the advices parti|cular Per&s;ons receiv'd from that Country, were &s;o unfavourable, that now they de&s;pair'd of &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>However, their News from all hands made no mention of the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and the Em|peror conceal'd his De&s;ign as to that Affair, &s;o clo&s;ely, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to penetrate into it. It was generally believ'd, That Prince <HI>James</HI> was the only Rival the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> had to fear; and this was the common Opinion in <HI>Po|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">and;</HI> for not one dream'd of the Duke of <HI>Sax|ony</HI> but &s;uch as were in the Plot. Neverthe|le&s;s Prince <HI>James</HI> was univer&s;ally hated by great and &s;mall, in regard of the King his Father, who, ever &s;ince he had mounted the Throne, behaved him&s;elf towards his Subjects, rather as a particular intere&s;&s;ed Per&s;on, than as a true Sovereign; for he had made open Sale of all the Favours with which the Kings his Predece&s;&s;ors had always us'd to gratifie their Subjects: So that tho' the&s;e People
<PB N="127" REF="280">
were for many Ages, accu&s;tom'd to choo&s;e no-King in a &s;trange Family, when their own Roy|al Family afforded one; yet they had forgotten that Cu&s;tom &s;o far in regard of him, that they would rather have &s;een the meane&s;t of them|&s;elves upon the Throne, than have cho&s;en any of his I&s;&s;ue. They were extreamly afraid that they, following his Example when advanced to the Royal Dignity, would &s;queeze their Subjects to the very Marrow, as he had always done.</P>
<P>This general Aver&s;ion rais'd the hopes of the Abbot of <HI>Polignac,</HI> tho' he &s;aw that a great many of the Palatines would not declare for the Prince. This he attributed to their Avarice, and thought it was only out of a de&s;ign of obliging him to give more Money. They were glad to find him of that Opinion; for while he con|tinued ignorant of their Conduct, their Affair was like to have the better &s;ucce&s;s. In fine, <HI>This,</HI> and the Affair of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> were the two things that were mo&s;t in view at <HI>France,</HI> when the Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI> wrote to His Maje&s;ty, if he did not &s;end him &s;ome Succours, he had rea&s;on to fear, that his Honour would certainly &s;uf|fer in the Enterprize in which he was engag|ed. He gave the King a particular account of what had pa&s;s'd before the Place, that His Ma|je&s;ty might be the more &s;en&s;ible of his &s;traits: So that the King having no more Rea&s;on to doubt of his Nece&s;&s;ity, caus'd all the Troops he could draw out of <HI>Languedoc</HI> and <HI>Provence</HI> to march th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">her.

<PB N="128" REF="281">
of the <HI>Covert Way,</HI> they afterwards attack'd the <HI>Ba&s;tion,</HI> which was taken and re-taken twice. A Colonel of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> nam'd <HI>Dillon,</HI> who Commanded one of the&s;e attacks, had pa&s;s'd his time there very indifferently, if he had not been well belov'd by the Regiment. One of his Sol|diers who had de&s;erted into the Town, came within four paces of him, and having di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him from the others, <HI>Dillon,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>Mind that it's in my power to Kill thee; but I won't; for thou never ha&s;t done me any harm: However, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t by thee an Officer who is a common Hang-man of the Soldiers, I'll at lea&s;t hinder him from doing any more mi&s;chief.</HI> This &s;aid, he Shot him through the Belly dead upon the Spot. This <HI>Ba&s;tion</HI> having been thus di&s;put|ed by both Parties, it fell, at la&s;t, into the hands of the Duke of <HI>Vendome,</HI> who rais'd a Battery upon it; from which he thundred in &s;uch a man|ner into the Town, that he judg'd, in all ap|pearance, the Enemies would be oblig'd to &s;ur|render it in a &s;hort time. He acquainted the King with the&s;e News, and wrote to him, That he hoped in five or &s;ix days to &s;end <HI>Chameraut</HI> to His Maje&s;ty, with an account of the Place's being &s;urrendred. Every one was glad to hear this News, with which His Maje&s;ty was over|joy'd. This Expre&s;s was very acceptable; and while they were impatient for the arrival of the other, who was to compleat His Maje&s;ty's &s;ati&s;|faction, they admir'd mightily that good Fortune, that made him Ma&s;ter of a Place where there was not only a numerous Garri&s;on, but where it was al&s;o impo&s;&s;ible for his own Army to &s;hut up all the Pa&s;&s;ages. However, from day to day they waited <HI>Chameraut</HI>'s arrival; and expected him with the fir&s;t Po&s;t. At la&s;t there arriv'd one, who they believ'd, came from that Country, becau&s;e his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hai&s;e was extreamly Dirty. But no Dirt comes
<PB N="1229" REF="282">
thence; for it is always dry there, in regard, it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eldom, or never Rains in that Country; but the Roads leading from thence being very deep, and it having Rain'd &s;o much lately, there was a &s;udden Report in <HI>Paris,</HI> that an Expre&s;s was arriv'd with the News of <HI>Barcelona</HI>'s being taken. However, it was a plea&s;ant &s;ort of Courier that came in that Chai&s;e, namely a lu&s;ty <HI>Sturgeon,</HI> which they had catch'd in <HI>Normandy,</HI> and &s;ent to the <HI>Dauphin;</HI> yet it was needle&s;s to tell the World &s;o; none was like to believe it, being &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with <HI>Chemeraut</HI>'s arrival. This oblig|ed a Court Lord to An&s;wer the&s;e Faithle&s;s Peo|ple who &s;poke to him after that manner, That it was true the Courier was arriv'd; but had rencountred with a Misfortune upon the Road, &s;o that none could learn the particulars of the Towns being taken, from him; That having met with A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, the Po&s;tillion brought him dead in the Chai&s;e, and that no doubt they had car|ried off his Packet; for having &s;earch'd him, they had found none about him. This Di&s;|cour&s;e gave occa&s;ion to another piece of News fully as true as the former: For the Report flying about very &s;uddenly, all <HI>Paris</HI> believ'd the next day, that <HI>Chemeraut</HI> had been Kill'd. However, the Man was in excellent good health, and &s;o far from having any de&s;ire to die, that he took all po&s;&s;ible care of his Per&s;on. He was as Fat and Gro&s;s as four other Men, nor did he become &s;o by feeding upon the Air, for he generally eat as much as other twelve Men.</P>
<P>After all, the&s;e News prov'd only fal&s;e A|larms. Before the Town was taken, the <HI>Viceroy</HI> was re&s;olv'd to hazzard a Battle with the Duke, and, for that purpo&s;e, &s;ummon'd together all tho&s;e whom they call <HI>Miquelets</HI> in that Country; and having joyn'd them with his regular Troops, he
<PB N="130" REF="283">
approach'd to the Duke of <HI>Vendome.</HI> It had been in vain for him to cut off their Provi&s;i|ons by Land, they being &s;upply'd from the Sea. He had a more noble De&s;ign than to amu&s;e him&s;elf &s;o meanly, he meant to decide the Af|fair all at once by a Battle; and to that pur|po&s;e having call'd a Council of War, he re&s;olv|ed, with his General Officers, to march the next day in the Evening, directly towards the Duke. He acquainted the Governor of <HI>Barcelona</HI> with his Re&s;olution, to the end, that at the &s;ame time, he might make a vigorous Sally upon the Enemies, and &s;o attack them upon all &s;ides. In le&s;s than half an hour after, the Duke knew all the mea&s;ures they had concerted again&s;t him, and being thus put upon his Guard, he march'd to meet him the Night before he was to exe|cute his De&s;ign. But the Viceroy had already divided his Army in two parts, in order to at|tack him with the greater advantage. This was made known to the Duke, who fell upon him with extraordinary fury; notwith&s;tanding the Laurels the Vice-Roy had promi&s;ed to him&s;elf, he was &s;till in Bed when they came to acquaint him, that his Guards lo&s;t ground; they made no re|&s;i&s;tance at all, but betook them to their heels; and the Duke had certainly taken the Viceroy (as was expected) in Bed, if they had not awaked him of a &s;udden. The Noi&s;e he heard about his Tent, having &s;urpriz'd his Attendants as well as him&s;elf, made them believe that all was lo&s;t: He excus'd his <HI>Valet de Chambre</HI> from his Duty at that time; and fearing he had no time to Dre&s;s, he made the be&s;t of his way Nak|ed as he was, thinking the greate&s;t thing he could do, was to &s;ave him&s;elf. The part of his Army that was with him, followed his Example, ex|cept a very few that put them&s;elves upon the Defence. The Duke made a great many Pri&s;o|ners;

All he wanted now to compleat his Victory, was, to know, that the other Detachment he had &s;ent again&s;t him, had met with the &s;ame Fate, and in a very little time he had that &s;atisfaction. He knew that Mon&s;. <HI>D'U&s;&s;on,</HI> whom he had en|tru&s;ted with that Expedition, had behav'd him|&s;elf gallantly; and return'd to joyn him with all the Glory he could de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The Governor of <HI>Barcelona</HI> was as much &s;ur|pri&s;ed as the Prince <HI>D'Arm&s;tad,</HI> when he heard the&s;e Tydings. The Duke did not keep him long in the Dark, he &s;ent to acquaint him with it, that he might not continue any longer to make a fruitle&s;s Defence. But having &s;till eight Thou&s;and Men in Garri&s;on, he thought it Di&s;|honourable to &s;urrender to a Prince, who had not Soldiers enough to inve&s;t the Place intirely, and therefore kept out &s;ome few days longer, ra|ther to fulfil the Duty of a brave Commander, (of which he had been always emulous) than out of any hops of hindring the Town from be|ing taken.</P>
<P>In effect, in a very few days he caus'd a Parly to be beat, pretending to give up the Town on|ly, and retire with his Men into the Ca&s;tle, which (being &s;ituated upon a Hill) he could hold out for a con&s;iderable time. But he delay'd &s;o long in &s;urrendring, that the Duke refus'd to accept any other Compo&s;ition, than to have the Ca&s;tle given up as well as the Town.

At <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> in regard of the Formalities, the Pleni|potentaries were oblig'd to ob&s;erve mea&s;ures with one another. <HI>Portland</HI> &s;ent a Trumpeter, as of his own accord, to the Mar&s;hal, to ask a pri|vate interview with him, without making any mention of his Affair. The Mar&s;hal thought it convenient, with the Advice of the other two <HI>French</HI> Mar&s;hals, to con&s;ent to it; and having agreed, that they &s;hould meet by them&s;elves, and their Guards &s;hould be of an equal number; The Earl propos'd to him to remove &s;ome Dif|ferences there, that would require too long time at <HI>Ry&s;wick.</HI> The Mar&s;hal being unwilling to un|dertake any thing without expre&s;s Order from His Maje&s;ty, &s;ent an Expre&s;s to know his Will. The great de&s;ire the King had to make Peace, made him approve of what the Earl propos'd, without con&s;idering, perhaps, what advantage he might have over the Mar&s;hal, in a &s;uperiour Ge|nius; and the inconvenience of putting him upon
<PB N="133" REF="286">
a level with a Mar&s;hal of <HI>France,</HI> an Honour His Maje&s;ty ought not to look upon as indiffer|ent. It's true, as the King of <HI>France</HI> had advanc|ed <HI>Boufflers</HI> from a Cadet of <HI>Picardy,</HI> to the Dignity of a Duke, Mar&s;hal of <HI>France,</HI> Gover|nor of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Province of his Kingdom; And, in fine, of a Knight of his <HI>Or|der:</HI> So King <HI>William</HI> had rais'd the other from an ordinary Gentleman of <HI>Guelderland,</HI> to an Earl and Peer of <HI>England,</HI> and Knight of the Order of the <HI>Garter.</HI> But &s;till there was this difference, that the one Commanded an Army, and the other never did: Be&s;ides, there was that al&s;o to be &s;aid, That <HI>His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Ma|je&s;ty</HI> had never own'd King <HI>William,</HI> and &s;o the <HI>French</HI> e&s;teem'd only the Earl as the Favourite of a Prince, whom they had never recogniz'd as King.</P>
<P>King <HI>William</HI> was glad that His mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian Maje&s;ty over-look'd all tho&s;e con&s;iderations; not that he wanted to obtain a recogni&s;ance from him, as well as from other Crown'd Heads; but becau&s;e he knew well that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were as pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;irous of a Peace as the <HI>French.</HI> Their Commerce was then at a &s;tand; and, which is very &s;urpri&s;ing, the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King had been a gainer by what was reckon'd his probable Ruin. After he had lo&s;t I do not know how many Ships at <HI>la Hogue,</HI> and was ren|der'd uncapable of appearing at Sea; He had found his Account in the way of Piracy, and had taken &s;o many Prizes both from the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> that both of 'em were quite ca&s;t down. 'Tis inconceivable what an infinite num|ber the&s;e Prizes are &s;aid to amount to; and tho' I have heard an account of it from one of the greate&s;t Traders in <HI>England,</HI> who ought to know that Affair as well as any body, yet I &s;hall be cautious of repeating it, for fear I &s;hould be

charg'd with Credulity. In effect, the thing is &s;o &s;urprizing, that it a&s;toni&s;hes one: But, after all, if we con&s;ider that the&s;e two Nations &s;ub|&s;i&s;t only by their Commerce, and that the Sea was continually cover'd with their Ve&s;&s;els, &s;o that the <HI>French</HI> had an opportunity of attacking 'em every minute with an advantage, e&s;pecial|ly when they were without Convoys; upon this con&s;ideration, I &s;ay, we may ea&s;ily conceive how they came to &s;u&s;tain &s;o great a lo&s;s. But let it be as it will, K. <HI>William</HI> being &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of a Peace, in order to be free from &s;uch Inconveniencies, order'd my Lord <HI>Portland</HI> to re|move all the difficulties that might oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>In the mean time K. <HI>James</HI> had but a &s;orry Game to play. Pur&s;uant to the King's Promi&s;e of never making a Peace till he were re&s;tored, He had all along hop'd, that His Maje&s;ty would effect his Re&s;toration &s;ooner or later. And this his expectation was &s;crew'd higher by the King's open Declaration to all <HI>Europe,</HI> that he would make his Promi&s;e good. Be&s;ides, that this un|happy Prince was turn'd out of his Dominions, only, becau&s;e he would not declare again&s;t the King. He had been frequently Sollicited to op|po&s;e the King's Intere&s;t before the Prince of <HI>O|range</HI> came into his Place; and had he done that, no Potentate what&s;oever would ever have con&s;ented to his being di&s;quieted. Nay, to &s;peak the Truth, 'twas a thing of too dangerous Con|&s;equence for the Potentates them&s;elves; but that Prince having di&s;cover'd his firm Re&s;olution to &s;tand by the &s;ecret Alliance he had made with the King, all other Princes combin'd again&s;t him, becau&s;e he would not joyn with them in reducing a Power that &s;eem'd to threaten their Repo&s;e. This, the mo&s;t Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;tian King was very &s;en&s;ible of, and did not fail to acknow|ledge it. He did for him all that he could do,
<PB N="135" REF="288">
and offer'd both him and his Qeen a Retreat and Entertainment. Tho' he was engag'd in a War with the greate&s;t part of <HI>Europe,</HI> yet he gave him fifty thou&s;and <HI>Louis d'Ors</HI> a Year. 'Tis true, this was but a &s;mall allowance for the King of <HI>England,</HI> upon the compari&s;on with what he had when he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd his Dominions; but 'twas a great deal for a Prince to give, that was at the &s;ame time oblig'd to maintain four or five hun|dred thou&s;and Men, to make head again&s;t the numerous Enemies that his Grandeur had rai&s;|ed again&s;t him; and upon that &s;core, doubtle&s;s K. <HI>James</HI> was oblig'd to him. But after all, 'twas not long of the King that he did not make good his Promi&s;e. The unfortunate Prince had been always guilty of the &s;ame Fault, that his Brother committed when he occa&s;ion'd the lo&s;s of the Battle of <HI>Dunbar.</HI> He care&s;s'd the <HI>Scots</HI> in &s;uch a manner, that he him&s;elf oppos'd his own Re&s;tauration. His chief Mini&s;ter was a <HI>Scotch|man,</HI> and there having always been a great jea|lou&s;ie between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> the pre|ference he gave to the latter at his Court, ali|enated the Hearts of the former. This was the occa&s;ion, that a great many Enterprizes form'd on his behalf, never took; and fora&s;much as that Prince had much more Devotion than Brains, as the <HI>French</HI> could not but lament his Fate, &s;o they could not avoid &s;aying, That tho' he had &s;unk him&s;elf by his bad Conduct, yet 'twas not rea&s;onable they &s;hould &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;uck'd in along with him. In fine, the King being much more oblig'd to his own King|dom than to any other, could not avoid the gi|ving him to know, That many things he did were directly oppo&s;ite to his Intere&s;t. Nay, all his true Friends had told him the &s;ame thing upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, in&s;omuch, that to &s;atisfie the one and the other, he pretended to di&s;grace My Lord

<HI>Melfort,</HI> Brother to the Chancellor of <HI>Scotland.</HI> This Mini&s;ter was hated, not only at his Ma|&s;ter's Court, but even by the <HI>French,</HI> who had attended <HI>K.

And, in earne&s;t, if the digre&s;&s;ion were excu&s;able, I could ea&s;ily make it out, that <HI>that</HI> Mini&s;ter wanted either Conduct or Fidelity.

However, at one of their Interviews, where &s;everal Of|ficers were pre&s;ent on both &s;ides, My Lord <HI>Port|land</HI> hearing a di&s;charge of Cannon and Mu&s;quets in the <HI>French</HI> Army, ask'd the Mar&s;hal what the meaning of it was: The Mar&s;hal made an&s;wer, That 'twas occa&s;ion'd by the News the King had &s;ent of the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Election to the Crown of <HI>Poland.</HI> This was matter of Fact; for Abbot <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ignac</HI> had di&s;patch'd a Courier to the Court to acquaint the King, that the Prince was proclaim'd King of <HI>Poland</HI> by the Cardinal Primate and &s;ome Palatines that &s;ided with him. But this Intelligence included another part, name|ly,
<PB N="137" REF="290">
That the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> was likewi&s;e pro|claim'd King, by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cujavia,</HI> and all the Parti&s;ans of the <HI>Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</HI> This ought, at lea&s;t probably, to have prevented our making &s;o much ha&s;te; and upon that &s;core, my Lord <HI>Portland</HI> fell a Laughing; and told the Mar&s;hal, That, indeed, this &s;poke the <HI>French</HI> to be quicker than all other Nations; That they had formerly &s;hewn the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition upon many Occa&s;ions; and that in this Affair, they &s;till continu'd to have the &s;tart of their Allies; but in the mean time, the Allies having time enough to te&s;tifie their Joy, upon the advantages that accru'd to 'em, had re|&s;olv'd to &s;tay till Night, or next Morning, before they gave a &s;olemn proof of the Joy they were fill'd with, upon the News, That the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and not the Prince of <HI>Conty,</HI> had mounted that Throne.</P>
<P>The Mar&s;hal thought he Banter'd him, in propo&s;ing a Prote&s;tant for a Dignity, that could not be enjoy'd but by a Roman-Catholick. Had my Lord made mention of Prince <HI>James,</HI> it had made another &s;ort of impre&s;&s;ion upon him. In fine, my Lord <HI>Portland</HI> having a mind that he &s;hould not flatter him&s;elf any longer, upon the imaginary Succe&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> Party, gave him a naked account of the Matter. Upon this di&s;|covery, the Army that was Celebrating the Glory of the Prince of <HI>Conty,</HI> with a full admiration of his Valou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, were then mightily &s;urpriz'd. How|ever, they were unwilling to believe it; for that Nation can never be per&s;waded of any thing that tends to their di&s;advantage; whether it be, That this is a common Humour among other Nations, or, That they in particular are pre&s;umptuous up|on their own Merit. But what inflam'd their &s;u&s;picion, the Court, who knew the bottom of Things, more than any body el&s;e, was very &s;ilent upon the Matter, after the Solemnity was over.
<PB N="138" REF="291">
Their de&s;ign in the Solemnity, was only to per|&s;wade the People, That their Intere&s;t went well in <HI>Poland;</HI> and &s;o to comfort 'em, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, for the lo&s;s of the Money they had &s;ent thither.

<P>I cannot tell what the Prince's own Thoughts were, or whether he believ'd the Report, of the reality of his Election. He made no di&s;covery of his Mind.

They were likewi&s;e &s;en&s;i|ble, That the War they were oblig'd to undertake upon that account, would be very di&s;advantage|ous to 'em. They knew very well, that the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> was a powerful Prince, and that his Confederate Princes had their Troops conveniently Po&s;ted; that they could ea&s;ily conduct 'em to <HI>Po|land,</HI> without any danger; whereas, the Troops to be &s;ent from <HI>France,</HI> would be oblig'd to im|bark in &s;ome Sea-Port of the <HI>French <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">landers,</HI> and land in the Neighbourhood of certain Potentates, who&s;e Affection to the Prince of <HI>Conty,</HI> the King had &s;ome rea&s;on to doubt.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conty,</HI> perceiving he would be oblig'd to un&s;heath his Sword, if he meant to make good his Election, dur&s;t not di&s;play the Affliction he was under, upon the view of leaving a Mi&s;tre&s;s, that he lov'd as pa&s;&s;ionately as a Crown. His only aim, was to plea&s;e the King, who pre&s;s'd him to accept of that Crown, as well for his own Intere&s;t, as out of the Love he bore
<PB N="139" REF="292">
him. However, &s;uch a degree of indifference was very odd, in a Prince of his Courage, and a Nephew of the Prince of <HI>Conde.</HI> One would have thought, that he would have exerted his utmo&s;t efforts, to mount the Throne, &s;ince his Uncle, upon a de&s;ign of that nature, had not only rais'd a Civil War in his Country, but put him&s;elf at the Head of the Capital Enemies of his King and Country. Some days pa&s;s'd without any noi&s;e, only the King &s;aluted the Prince and Prince&s;s, as King and Queen of <HI>Poland.</HI> In like manner, all the Grandees pay'd 'em the Re&s;pect &s;uitable to that Dignity; and in order to give a colour for his not departing to receive the Crown, 'twas gi|ven out, That Amba&s;&s;adors were expected from <HI>Poland,</HI> to fetch him. The more credulous &s;ort of People &s;atisfy'd them&s;elves with this News; but the more &s;en&s;ible part of Mankind, were more di&s;tru&s;tful than ever, of the validity of the Election. They own'd, indeed, That to wait the Arrival of Amba&s;&s;adors, was a Thing of more Glory, than to depart before their Arrival; but, at the &s;ame time, they alledg'd, (and that very ju&s;tly) That 'twas not expedient, when a Crown is not di&s;puted, and that the Crown being pro|mis'd to him, he was &s;o far from being ty'd to that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, that he ought to &s;et out with the utmo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, and appear at the Head of his Party; le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t, for want of his Pre&s;ence, many &s;hould be corrupted, and drawn over to his E|nemy</P>

In order to &s;ecure his Favour, They repre&s;ented,
<PB N="140" REF="293">
with the utmo&s;t application, their &s;u&s;picion of the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s Conver&s;ion. Indeed, that was a very nice Point; and all Men, tho' never &s;o partial, were &s;en&s;ible, That his declaring for the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, had more of Ambition in it, than Devotion. However, the Pope being un|willing that a Prote&s;tant Prince &s;hould Sit upon that Throne, was &s;o much again&s;t the Elector, that one would have thought he could never be for him. Be&s;ides, the Cardinal-Primate &s;ent a Courier, to a&s;&s;ure him, That the Intere&s;t of the Catholick Religion was entirely ruin'd, if he &s;uf|fer'd the Elector to be prefer'd to the Prince of <HI>Conty.</HI> This Me&s;&s;age, he was prompted to, as well by his Intere&s;t, as by his Zeal for the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Religion; for the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cujavia</HI> had in|croach'd upon the Privileges of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Gne&s;ne,</HI> which ju&s;tly claims the &s;ole Right of Proclaiming the Elected King.</P>
<P>In the mean time, there happen'd a Quarrel between Husband and Wife, in one of the princi|pal Families retaining to the Court.

We mu&s;t know, that a Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> not a Member of the Senate, but one of the Nobles of the <HI>Terra|firma,</HI> being Marry'd to a Lady that he lov'd very tenderly, had &s;o much Complai&s;ance, as to &s;a|tisfie her Curio&s;ity, by carrying her to &s;ee <HI>France.</HI> But tho' the Beauty of <HI>France</HI> draws &s;o many Strangers to vi&s;it it, yet her de&s;ign was only to have it &s;aid, that &s;he re&s;embled the Queen of <HI>Sheba,</HI> in coming &s;o far to &s;ee the Glory of <HI>Solo|mon.</HI> She had heard a thou&s;and great Things of the King and His Reign; and being fond of &s;ee|ing with her Eyes, whether the Reports were true, or enlarg'd beyond the due extent, &s;he came
<PB N="141" REF="294">
on purpo&s;e along with her Husband to <HI>Ver&s;ailles;</HI> in order to make the di&s;covery. Such an Adven|ture as this, was only wanting to compleat the Hi&s;tory of the King; and tho&s;e who are employ'd in Writing it, will take care not to forget it. However, the Husband and his Wife appearing of a &s;udden at Court, Mr. <HI>Bontems,</HI> Governor of the Ca&s;tle, had a mind to know who they were, pur&s;uant to the King's Orders, injoyning him to take notice of all the unknown Faces that ap|pear'd there. Accordingly, he caus'd to ask 'em, Who they were? and what brought 'em there? He was the more particular in his Que&s;tions, in that he heard their Equipage was a true <HI>Bohemian</HI> E|quipage; and had &s;erv'd to amu&s;e not only Men of Sen&s;e, but even the very Children. When the Que&s;tion was ask'd 'em, they were &s;urpriz'd, for that &s;uch Conduct was incon&s;i&s;tent with the Li|berty that Reigns in their Country. But being inform'd, that all unknown Faces were treated the &s;ame way, the Noble <HI>Venetian</HI> would needs go in Per&s;on, to acquaint Mr. <HI>Bontems</HI> with the occa&s;ion of their Voyage. Mr. <HI>Bontems</HI> was &s;ur|priz'd to hear of his Complai&s;ance, and having &s;poke of it to the King, was order'd to bring 'em both to &s;ee him Dine. To recompence the charge they were at, they were plac'd in the mo&s;t con|venient Place, for having a full view of the King.

<P>To return to my &s;ubject, <HI>John Bart</HI> having the curio&s;ity (as well as the&s;e Foreigners) to &s;ee the King Dine, there came a Per&s;on dignify'd with a Blue Ribbon, that finding he had a good Place, took it from him, without being over-aw'd by his Mein, which &s;peaks him more a &s;imple Tar|pallion, than a Commander of a Squadron. <HI>John Bart</HI> had heard, that &s;ome Compliment was due to a Blue Ribbon; however, he took him by the Coat, upon which the Badges of his Knighthood were fix'd, and told him, with a loud Voice, <HI>Mr. Blue Ribbon, pray give me my Place; you &s;ee the King when you will; but for me who does not &s;ee him but at the four Fe&s;tivals of the Year, 'tis but rea|&s;onable that I &s;hould not tamely &s;uffer my &s;elf to be robb'd of an advantage that I enjoy &s;o &s;eldom.</HI> The King hearing that, fell a Laughing; and told the Gentleman with the blue Ribbon, That <HI>Bart</HI> was in the right; and that 'twas His Plea&s;ure, that he &s;hould give <HI>Bart</HI> his Place, and rather &s;tand behind him, than affront him in that manner. Upon that, <HI>John Bart</HI> being better known on Board, than at Court, the Blue-Ribbon Spark turn'd about to view him; and apprehending his Mein to be much different from his Reputation, whi&s;per'd to a Duke that was ju&s;t by him, That if the Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> and his Lady, had receiv'd as little &s;atisfaction from the &s;ight of the King, as he had from that of <HI>John Bart,</HI> they would be &s;ure to grudge their Money. But that could not be; for tho' the King is very much alter'd from what he was, yet he &s;till pre&s;erves his good Mein; in&s;omuch, that 'tis &s;till vi&s;ible, that he has been a very graceful Man.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="296">
In fine, they were far from meeting with what <HI>John Bart</HI> did; for every body knew they came too far, not to have the opportunity of &s;eeing the King. But they had no &s;ooner receiv'd &s;atisfaction in that point, than they return'd to <HI>Italy.</HI> 'Tis &s;aid, they &s;taid only three days at <HI>Paris;</HI> and that, rather to re&s;t them&s;elves, than to &s;ee the Curio&s;ities of the Place. This Scene being Acted in the Face of the whole Court, and being the common &s;ubject of Di&s;cour&s;e; the Per&s;on of Quality, I pointed to above, happening to Talk of it to his Lady, a Quarrel en&s;ued, after this man|ner: The Lady told her Husband, That if &s;he were to wi&s;h for any thing in this World, it &s;hould be this, That &s;he might have as Complai&s;ant a Husband, as that <HI>Venetian</HI> Lady; he having un|dertaken a Journey of almo&s;t 1000 Leagues, on purpo&s;e to plea&s;e her; and by that means &s;hewn the greate&s;t in&s;tances of a pliant Temper, that any Man can ever &s;hew. Her Husband reply'd, That his Conduct did not &s;peak &s;o much a flexi|ble Temper, as Folly; and that, for his part, if he had a Wife, that would de&s;ire &s;uch a thing of him, he would look on her as the greate&s;t and mo&s;t extravagant Fool, not only in <HI>Paris,</HI> but e|ven in <HI>Bedlam.</HI> Each of 'em maintain'd their Sentiments with great warmth; and the Lady told him, That it &s;eem'd he was not in the hu|mour to &s;atisfie her, in ca&s;e &s;he de&s;ir'd to &s;ee the Emperor, or the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> The Gentleman made an&s;wer, That if ever that Maggot took her, he would not content him&s;elf with &s;hutting her up in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> but would &s;tifle her with his own Hands, as a Mad-woman. Perhaps he only &s;aid &s;o, to &s;ignifie the aver&s;ion he had for the&s;e two Princes, who were the King's Enemies: But the Lady putting a Literal meaning upon the reply, they came to high Words, and quarrel'd out|right,</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="297">
This was the Product of the Complai&s;ance that a Noble <HI>Venetian</HI> &s;hew'd to his Lady: But in the mean while, there happen'd an Accident at Court, that was yet more &s;urprizing, and that one Day, will perplex the Hi&s;torians, tho' they are not very fond of &s;ounding the truth of it. There's a little Town in <HI>Provence,</HI> call'd <HI>Salon,</HI> that formerly gave Birth to <HI>No&s;tradamus,</HI> a Man very well known at this Day, by his Centuries; &s;ome of which have come to pa&s;s in &s;o convincing a man|ner, that what was formerly ob&s;cure, is now as clear as Sun&s;hine. Among the&s;e Articles, I rec|kon what relates to the Death of <HI>Charles</HI> I. King of <HI>England,</HI> and that of Mr. <HI>de Cinqumares,</HI> pro|vided &s;till, that the&s;e were not foi&s;ted after-hand into his Works. But let that be as it will, this Town which produc'd a &s;ort of a Prophet in the preceding Age, has furni&s;h'd us with one in this; or at lea&s;t, &s;uch a Character is given of a cer|tain Gentleman, that appear'd then at Court, of whom this is the Hi&s;tory. About that time, the pretended Gho&s;t of that famous A&s;trologer above|mention'd, appear'd to a Man of this City. I know not whether it was by Night or by Day; but this I know, That the Apparition put the Man in a great fear; and above all things, ad|vis'd him, not to mention to any body, what he &s;poke to him; nay, he did not except his Wife; and the Man made a &s;ign with his Head, import|ing, that he would obey him; for he was at that time Speechle&s;s, and fear had &s;o much influence upon him, that he could not open his Mouth. Thereupon the Apparition advis'd him to go to the Intendant of <HI>Provence,</HI> and give him to know from him, That he &s;hould give him Letters, to introduce him to the King: It repre&s;ented further, That it would not tell him pre&s;ently what he was to &s;ay before the King, but that he would appear again to him, when he &s;hould come near
<PB N="145" REF="298">
to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and there teach him his Le&s;|&s;on.</P>
<P>Upon that, the Apparition di&s;appear'd, and left him for Dead, &s;o much was the Man fright|ned by his Wonders, as well as by his di&s;mal A&s;|pect. After &s;ome time, the Man came to him|&s;elf; but &s;o, as that 'twas plain he had &s;ome|thing extraordinary in his Head. His Wife ask'd him what it was; but the Prohibition, laid upon him by the Apparition, kept him from di&s;cover|ing any thing for &s;ome time. At la&s;t, his Wife having us'd a thou&s;and Wheedles, to make him reveal his Mind; he open'd his Mouth I know not how often, in order to recount the Adventure, and &s;hut it as often again; by rea&s;on that the Apparition had back'd the Prohibition with &s;uch Threats, as &s;car'd him. He told his Wife, That he &s;hould dye, if ever he broke Silence upon the Matter; and the fear that this &s;hould come to pa&s;s, &s;tiffed his Words, when he was mo&s;t temp|ted to &s;peak.</P>
<P>His Wife's Curio&s;ity was inflam'd by his re|&s;erv'dne&s;s; &s;he pre&s;s'd him more than ever to re|veal the Secret. The Husband reply'd, That his Life depended upon it, and that he could not do it. But that Word &s;crew'd up her Curio&s;ity to the la&s;t degree. In fine, &s;he would not let him be ea&s;ie, till he made the di&s;covery; and the poor Man being fooli&s;hly fond of her, had no &s;ooner acquainted her with the Apparition, and the di&s;cour&s;e that pa&s;s'd, than he fell down quite Dead upon the &s;pot. Upon this, the Woman was as much a&s;toni&s;h'd as he was, when the Gho&s;t appear'd to him. But after &s;econd Thoughts, &s;he con&s;tru'd the di&s;cour&s;es he utter'd before his Death, to be only the effect of a Brain di&s;turb'd by a Mortal Sickne&s;s, and told nothing of the Matter; or if &s;he did, 'twas with &s;uch an Air,
<PB N="146" REF="299">
as if &s;he had taken his Di&s;covery, for the Ravings of a di&s;temper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d Brain.</P>
<P>This Accident made no great Noi&s;e in <HI>Salon,</HI> or the adjacent places; which certainly it would, if it had been fully known: Nay, the People there, did dot &s;o much as mind it; for every one, as well as his W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">e, believ'd that the Man's Brai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ut of order, when he talk'd of his Vi&s;ion. But at the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">me time, the Vi&s;ion appear'd to another Inhabitent of the &s;ame City, and made him the &s;ame Compliment; and he was as fooli&s;h as the other; f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r he &s;poke of it that &s;ame day to the Curate, and his indi&s;cretion was follow'd by the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ate; for he di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d upon the &s;pot. The noi&s;e of his Death, and the manner of it, being &s;pread abroad, the People recall'd to their me|mory, what was &s;aid upon the Death of the o|ther. This was the only &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ver <HI>Salon,</HI> and for 20 Leagues round it; nay, every body took the liberty to Comment upon it. But in the mean time, the Vi&s;ion appear'd to a Black&s;mith, who&s;e Hou&s;e was not far from tho&s;e of the two Men, I &s;poke of but now. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible, he was as much afraid, as the other two; but their example being recent, and of too great con&s;equence, to &s;uffer him to be guilty of the &s;ame fault; he was very attentive to the Words utter'd by the Gho&s;t; and immediately upon its di&s;appearance, went to the Intendant, pur&s;uant to its orders. That Magi&s;trate gave Au|dience every day, to all that had any bu&s;ine&s;s with him; &s;o that, the Smith had no occa&s;ion for any one to introduce him: But his Story be|ing &s;uch as could not well be told publickly, he beg'd of him, that he would retire with him to his Clo&s;et, becau&s;e he had an Affair of extream Con&s;equence to imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rt. The Intendant, &s;eeing that the Man made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ut a &s;orry appearance, could not conjecture, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> this important Affair might
<PB N="147" REF="300">
be. But being oblig'd to hear every one, and to neglect nothing relating to his Po&s;t, he de&s;ir'd him to &s;tay a little, till he had given Audience to the re&s;t; after which, he would hear him at his lei&s;ure. Accordingly, after the general Au|dience was over, he and the Smith retir'd to his Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>Then the Black&s;mith acquainted him, That the Af|fair he was about to open, would at fir&s;t view &s;eem to be a pure Whim; and that he knew he would be di&s;mi&s;s'd for a Fool; that to prevent &s;uch ap|prehen&s;ions, he told him &s;o much before-hand; and in fourteen Days time, he would &s;end to &s;ee for him, being then &s;en&s;ible of his error, in treat|ing him as a Man troubled with Maggots. In fine, he &s;et forth the occa&s;ion of his coming thi|ther, namely, That a Vi&s;ion having appear'd a Month ago to two different Per&s;ons, (that certain|ly he had heard of, upon the account of the fatal Con&s;equences) had likewi&s;e appear'd to him, very lately; That it had order'd him to come to the Intendant, to de&s;ire he might be &s;ent to the King; That it had promis'd to appear again to him, at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> or near to it, in order to in&s;truct him in what he was to &s;ay to His Maje&s;ty; That ac|cordingly, he came to di&s;charge his Commi&s;&s;ion faithfully; and upon that &s;core, was not afraid of meeting with the &s;ame Fate, that befel the other two.</P>
<P>The Intendant had heard &s;omething of this odd Adventure; but had always taken it for a fabu|lous Fiction; and, pur&s;uant to that Thought, check'd the Man in a &s;trange manner. He ask'd him, If that was his way to abu&s;e an In|tendant's Time, every minute of which he knew to be precious; and at the &s;ame time, gave him to know, that he de&s;erv'd nothing but a Goal. The Man reply'd, That his Threats made no impre&s;&s;ion upon him, for that the Vi&s;ion had
<PB N="148" REF="301">
&s;ufficiently prepar'd him; That he would return home, &s;ince the Intendant order'd him &s;o to do; and that he would only have the trouble of re|turning, when the Intendant &s;hould &s;end for him.</P>
<P>Tho' the Intendant us'd him at this rate, yet he had a deep impre&s;&s;ion of what he &s;aid. His talk|ing &s;o &s;en&s;ibly, and &s;o unlike a di&s;temper'd Head, was &s;ufficient to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome Reflection to the Intendant; e&s;pecially, if we joyn to this the for|mer reports of that Apparition. In effect, the Mar&s;hal was no &s;ooner gone, but the Intendant wrote to the Lieutenant General of <HI>Salon,</HI> pray|ing him to acquaint him, Whether the reports of that Apparition were true, or fal&s;e? But to pre|vent the communication of retractible Things, he order'd him to draw up a formal Information, in ca&s;e he found any credit due to the reports that were &s;pread abroad. At the &s;ame time, he de|&s;ir'd a Character of the Man that had been with him; for he had taken down his Name at fir&s;t, and wanted to know, whether he was always reckon'd a Man of Sen&s;e, &s;uch as he appear'd to be. He likewi&s;e order'd him, to enquire, whe|ther there ever were any of his Family, either by the Father or Mother-&s;ide, that were Rattle brain'd. For if any &s;uch had been found out by chance, he had not fail'd to infer from thence, that he imi|tated their example, and by con&s;equence, that no &s;tre&s;s was to be laid upon what he &s;aid.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant obey'd this Letter punctually. He drew up an Information, and &s;ent it to the Intendant; by which he &s;aw, that all the reports of the Apparition, and its con&s;equences, were true; and that the Mar&s;hal was always reputed a Man of good Sen&s;e. The Lieutenant likewi&s;e g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ve an account of his Family; which contain'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> thing that could hinder the Intendant to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> the Court with the Affair. Accordingly,
<PB N="149" REF="302">
he Wrote of it to the Marquis of <HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> Se|cretary of State; but he did it in &s;uch a way, as &s;ignified, that he only look'd upon the Man as a Mad-man. For, he did not only &s;et forth his own incredulity upon the Matter, but the Mea|&s;ures he had taken to prevent his being impos'd upon; and &s;ent him the Information he had caus'd to be taken at <HI>Salon.</HI> By this he mean'd, and ju&s;tly indeed, to ju&s;tifie, That if there was any impo&s;i|tion in the Matter, he was not the fir&s;t Author of it. His plea was, That the Magi&s;trate of <HI>Salon,</HI> being upon the place, ought to know the Matter of Fact be&s;t; upon which, he concluded, That if he was deceiv'd, the fault ought not to lie up|on him. He thought him&s;elf oblig'd, in a par|ticular manner, to &s;ea&s;on his Letter with a great many Circum&s;tances, to clear him&s;elf from too much Credulity in that Mini&s;ter's Opinion; for that the Marquis being very Young, mu&s;t be le&s;s Credulous than other People. He knew, that at &s;uch an Age as he was of, &s;uch things are hardly credited; and that even the Apparition of <HI>Samuel</HI> would meet with no Faith from them, if it were not &s;poke of in the Books that cannot be call'd in que&s;tion, without Sacrilege. But the Marquis was more Credulous than one would have thought. He Writ him an An&s;wer, probably, after &s;peaking of it to the King; importing, That he might &s;end him the Man, but &s;o, as not to give any ground for charging either the one or the other with any Weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Intendant receiving this Order, injoyn'd the Lieutenant-General of <HI>Salon</HI> to &s;end him the Man, upon the pretence, of an&s;wering to the In|formation he had made, pur&s;uant to his Order. Accordingly, the Black&s;mith waited upon him, and told him at fir&s;t meeting, That he had &s;aid be|fore, 'twould not be long before he &s;ent for him again. The Intendant made an&s;wer, That he did
<PB N="150" REF="303">
not &s;end for him upon the de&s;ign he thought of, but to reprimand him for meaning to impo&s;e up|on him. By this Repre&s;entation, he thought to turn the Tables upon him, in order to &s;atisfie the Marquis's caution. But the Man knowing that he was guilty of nothing that could merit a reprimand, the Conference ended in this, That the Intendant gave him to know, that if he were as much per&s;waded of the Fact as he would have him believe he would be &s;o far from hindring him to go to <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ailles,</HI> that he would give him Introductory-Letters to the Marquis of <HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> and to facilitate his Journey, would give him a place in the fir&s;t Recruit-Convoy that was to go that way. The Man did not care which way he went, &s;o he could but &s;atisfie the de&s;ire of the Vi&s;ion; and accordingly, agreed to what was pro|pos'd. There was a Company of Recruits ju&s;t ready to be gone, which an Officer of the Town of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> had rais'd, and which were to pa&s;s near <HI>Paris.</HI> The Intendant recommended the Black&s;mith to him, and gave him &s;ome Mony to give him when he par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">d from him. That Officer carry'd him to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">erte</HI> under <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">narre,</HI> after having Wrote to the Intendant, in obedience to his Command, That he could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> nothing in the Man, but what bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">me a Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e man: For the Intendant had de&s;ir'd him to ob&s;erve him narrowly upon the Road, to the end, that if he di&s;cover'd any turn of Thought in him, he might acquaint the Mar|quis o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Barbe&s;ieux</HI> with it.</P>
<P>The Black&s;mith being thus arriv'd at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> took leave o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Officer, and repair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d to <HI>Ver|&s;ailles,</HI> where he did not knew what to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, be|cau&s;e the Gho&s;t had not yet appear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d to him. But the very Night that he arriv'd, while he was in great perplexity, he heard (as he &s;ays) one un|draw his Curtain, while he was full awake. Up|on that, the Gho&s;t appear'd to him, bid him fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="151" REF="304">
nothing, and gave him to know, That both the Secretary of State, and the King, would give him a Well-come Reception, notwith&s;tanding the dif|ficulties he met with at fir&s;t. Being thus in&s;tru|cted in what he was to &s;ay, both to the Marquis, and the King; he was at the &s;ame time, &s;trictly charg'd, never to divulge what was then told him, to any body, excepting His Maje&s;ty. The Gho&s;t acquainted him, That the Marquis of <HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> would endeavour, by all means, to pump the Se|cret out of him; but that he was to conceal it from him, as well as from every body el&s;e; for if he fail'd in that piece of Obedience, he &s;hould infallibly meet with the &s;ame Fate as befel the two Men in his Town.</P>
<P>The Gho&s;t di&s;appear'd immediately; and the Black&s;mith having no great inclination to Sleep longer, went in the morning to wait upon the Marquis of <HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> and deliver'd him the In|tendant's Letter. The Marquis immediately call'd him to his Clo&s;et, where they both continu'd for above an hour. The report of the Black&s;mith's en&s;uing Arrival, had been &s;pread all over the Court before he came. For upon his depar|ture from <HI>Provence,</HI> Letters were &s;ent to Town; and he was every where &s;til'd, <HI>The Prophet,</HI> for|a&s;much as no body doubted, but that he was go|ing to Prophe&s;ie &s;omething to the King, and had undertook that Journey only for that end. In the mean time, every body was mightily de&s;irous to know what the Matter was; and there being al|ways &s;ome, that pretend to refine upon Things beyond their Neighbours, a Report was &s;pread a|broad, That he had been put upon at the &s;ame rate as <HI>James Clement</HI> in former Times, tho' not in order to commit &s;uch a dete&s;table Action as he did, but to acquaint His Maje&s;ty under &s;o fair a covert, a great many things, that could not other|wi&s;e reach his Ears. I do not &s;peak this, as if I
<PB N="152" REF="305">
believ'd it; for I know very well, that the&s;e are only plea&s;ant Whims, familiar to tho&s;e, who, for want of bu&s;ine&s;s, employ their whole time in Com|menting upon whatever happens.</P>
<P>However, according to the Gho&s;t's Prediction, the Marquis of <HI>Barbe&s;ieux</HI> endeavour'd to work the Secret out of the Black&s;mith: But the Smith reply'd, That all his efforts upon that &s;core would be fruitle&s;s, in regard he had a Le&s;&s;on pre&s;crib'd to him, which he was oblig'd to ob&s;erve, under the pain of being puni&s;h'd upon the &s;pot; but to &s;hew that his advances were not Chimerical, he might give His Maje&s;ty to know, That the la&s;t time he Hunted at <HI>Fontainbleau,</HI> he was &s;ud|denly &s;urpriz'd with an Apparition, which put him into a great a&s;toni&s;hment; That the &s;ame Gho&s;t which appear'd to him, had at that time appear'd to His Maje&s;ty, and that his Hor&s;e had &s;een it, and &s;tarted a&s;ide, as if he would have thrown him; That the Apparition did not con|tinue above a moment, which occa&s;ion'd His Ma|je&s;ty's apprehen&s;ion, of being mi&s;taken, and his &s;peaking of it to no body; and that all this hapned to His Maje&s;ty only, in order to procure him ac|ce&s;s to the King, by &s;hewing, That he knew what none el&s;e in his Dominions was acquainted with. Upon the&s;e rea&s;ons, he hop'd His Maje&s;ty would make no difficulty in giving him Audi|ence.</P>
<P>The Marquis of <HI>Barbe&s;ieux</HI> was much &s;urpriz'd at the hearing of &s;uch a Circum&s;tance as that, which would quickly di&s;cover, whether there was any thing Supernatural in this Man's Pre|ten&s;ions, or whether he was an Impo&s;tor. And, in earne&s;t, if the King confirm'd the Matter of Fact, undoubtedly he mu&s;t have known &s;omething beyond a Natural Capacity. The Marquis ac|quainted the King with his Arrival, and with the Story he told; and all he had &s;aid, being, as 'tis
<PB N="153" REF="306">
alledg'd, found true, the King granted him a pri|vate Audience. What pa&s;s'd in this Interview, no-body can tell, becau&s;e 'twas kept as a profound Secret. All we know, is, That the pretended Prophet having &s;tay'd &s;ome days at Court, while few knew that he had the honour to &s;peak with the King; His Maje&s;ty agreed, that he &s;hould come and take leave of him publickly, when he took Coach to go a Hunting. The Duke of <HI>Duas,</HI> Captain of the Life-Guard, no &s;ooner &s;aw him, but he told the King, That if he had not order'd him to admit &s;uch a Fellow to approach His Per|&s;on, he had been far from doing it, becau&s;e he was certainly a Fool, or el&s;e His Maje&s;ty was much put upon. A great many others about Court were of his Mind; for people are not ea&s;i|ly convinc'd of &s;uch things as the&s;e. But the King took his part, and gave the Captain to know, that he was out in his Judgment, and that he had more Sen&s;e than he thought for.</P>
<P>This Expre&s;&s;ion was evidence, that he had told the King &s;ome very odd Things; for otherwi&s;e, the King would never have given him&s;elf the trouble to make &s;uch Declaration of his Thoughts. It awak'd the Curio&s;ity of all Mankind; and e|very-body would have given any thing to know the re&s;ult of his Conference with His Maje&s;ty, and <HI>Barbe&s;ieux.</HI> The Marquis's Friends pump'd him upon the matter; but he told 'em frankly, that 'twas in vain, in regard there was &s;omething in the matter that challeng'd his Secrecy. The vulgar People, who are naturally very credulous, fancy'd, that his Bu&s;ine&s;s with the King, was to Preach up the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the Impo&s;ts, that Nece&s;&s;ity had oblig'd him to lay upon 'em, in the time of &s;o cruel a War. The Prophet having ta|ken leave of the King, return'd to his own Coun|try; and the Marquis of <HI>Barbe&s;ieux</HI> having given him Mony at his arrival, and order'd him to conver&s;e
<PB N="154" REF="307">
with no body repeated his Bounty to him when he went. So that the Prophet &s;poke nothing of the matter to any-body while he was there; and in|deed, he could not well do it, if he would, for he was always kept within view.</P>
<P>Such an extraordinary Adventure as this did not fail to make a great deal of noi&s;e all over <HI>Paris,</HI> and even the whole Kingdom; but notwith&s;tanding that the appearance of Prodigies ought to make People reflect upon their Duty; yet I do not find that this made any Reformation of Manners. De|bauchery continued &s;till to Reign among Men and Women; and the exemplary Piety of the King, and part of the Court, had no effect upon the Libertine Spirits. His Maje&s;ty, who, ever &s;ince his application to Devotion, has made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to extirpate Vice, not only out of tho&s;e about his Per&s;on, but even tho&s;e who live at a di&s;tance, held at that time a Council of Con|&s;cience, at which the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> and &s;ome other Prelates, with Father <HI>de la Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e</HI> his Confe&s;&s;or, were call'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t. In that A&s;&s;emb|ly, &s;everal methods were propos'd for preventing the u&s;ual di&s;orders among the Officers and Sol|diers. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris</HI> being a very z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">|lous Man, cry'd up His Maje&s;ty's pious Intention; and gave the re&s;t to under&s;tand, that they ought to joyn all their Force in bringing it to bear. For this purpo&s;e, 'twas propos'd, That a Mi&s;&s;ionary &s;hould be &s;ent to each Regiment, in order to Preach to 'em, and Catechi&s;e 'em every day. But it being an&s;wer'd, That Mi&s;&s;ionaries would &s;carce be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ound to undertake the Office, by rea&s;on of their nece&s;|&s;ary Re&s;idence with the Regiments; another mo|tion was made and agreed to. I know not indeed whether it has yet produc'd the de&s;ired effect but what is not yet done, may be done here after; and that Time will di&s;cover. The mo+tion was, That none &s;hould be imploy'd as Al+moners
<PB N="155" REF="308">
of Regiments, but tho&s;e who are Per&s;ons of pious and good Lives, and who have Men of Merit to vouch for 'em: And that at the conclu|&s;ion of every Campagne they &s;hould be oblig'd to repair to the Seminaries, and continue there all Winter. To &s;peak the truth, I mu&s;t &s;ay this is an effectual Scheme for having no Almoners but &s;uch as are quite different from what they now are. But I que&s;tion if they'll find any that will &s;ubmit to that &s;ort of Life. Mo&s;t people put in for tho&s;e Places only to divert them&s;elves; and as &s;oon as they find what con&s;traint is mean'd 'em, they'll rather de&s;ert than &s;ubmit to it. Pro|bably that is the rea&s;on that the Thing is not yet put in Execution, and perhaps never will.</P>
<P>While mea&s;ures were concerting for the intro|ducing of &s;uch excellent Di&s;cipline among the Troops; one of the&s;e Almoners being impri&s;on'd by the King's Order, in one of the Ho&s;pitals for the Poor, made a &s;trange End after a very odd Life. He was a Recollet by Trade; but being unea&s;y under the confinement of a Convent, he procur'd a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion under the pretence of &s;erv|ing in this Imployment, which by Intrigues, and the Intere&s;t of Friends, he had obtain'd. He had continued in that Office &s;ome time; and as tho&s;e who are once in any mea&s;ure Corrupted, do quick|ly become more Corrupt in an Army; &s;o he form'd a de&s;ign to render him&s;elf &s;o nece&s;&s;ary at Court, by a fal&s;e Accu&s;ation, that he might be in a capacity to throw off his Habit which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> with as much unea&s;ine&s;s as formerly he did the confinement of the Cloy&s;ter. He had his eye upon one, Abbot <HI>Agnan,</HI> who, of a Fryer, had made him&s;elf a Chymi&s;t Phy&s;ician. He had a &s;trong mind to follow his Example, not in practi&s;ing Phy&s;ick which he did not under&s;tand, but in wearing the Habit of a &s;ecular Prie&s;t, in|&s;tead of that of a Religious one. His Plea was,
<PB N="156" REF="309">
That &s;ince they had allow'd that Abbot to di&s;|pen&s;e with his Vows upon the pretence of &s;ome Cures, he might obtain the &s;ame favour by &s;ome &s;ignal Service. Upon that view he repair'd to the Marquis of <HI>Chateauneuf,</HI> Secretary of State, who manag'd the Affairs of Religion, and pri|vately acquainted him, That an Officer of the Re|giment to which he was Almoner, had a de&s;ign upon the King's Life: He knew that <HI>that</HI> Officer was oblig'd to go off then, or next morning, to &s;ome forreign Country, as well as a great many others who would not change their Religion. Nay, he had coun&s;el'd him &s;o to do, and promis'd to come and &s;ee him, tho' he mean'd nothing le&s;s.</P>
<P>The Marquis of <HI>Chateauneuf,</HI> who is, in many things, the lea&s;t of all the four Secretaries of State, if it be Lawful to call any thing <HI>little</HI> that's a|bout &s;o great a Prince, &s;ent Orders immediately to Arre&s;t the Officer, and commanded the Recollet to continue at Court. In the mean time, the Of|ficer was gone, which the Recollet knew very well: However the Marquis being inform'd of his Departure, told the Recollet he was come too late, and that the Bird was flown three days be|fore. The Recollet made An&s;wer, That <HI>that</HI> was none of his fault, and that he could not do the Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ooner; That after all, he be|liev'd he was only gone to <HI>Languedoc,</HI> his Native Country, where he would be &s;ure to keep clo&s;e; and that in regard, he told him mo&s;t of his haunts, he believ'd he could unkennel him, if the Mar|quis would &s;ent him to that Country. The Mar|quis continued &s;till to believe what he &s;aid, and accordingly he &s;end him to <HI>Languedoc,</HI> where the Recollet arriv'd very &s;peedily, with the Mo|ny he had got for the Charge of the Journey. He had a permi&s;&s;ion upon his going out of <HI>Paris</HI> to put on a Gentleman's Habit. But, at la&s;t, having drill'd on the Affair as long as he could; the
<PB N="157" REF="310">
Mini&s;ter of State not offering to incourage him any longer, he return'd to this City, where he was inform'd, that the Marquis de&s;ign'd to take him up. The Marquis begun to &s;ee thro' his Knavety, and would not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be impos'd upon any longer. The Recollet came to know this piece of News very luckily. It fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l out, by chance, that in the very Inn at which he alighted, there was one of the Cou&s;ins of the Per&s;on he had accus'd, to whom Mr. <HI>de Chateau|neuf</HI> had communicated his Thoughts. Now, this Relation had told Mr. <HI>deChateauneuf,</HI> that his Cou&s;in was, indeed, a true Prote&s;tant; but he could be Surety, that he was not capable of the Thought he was charg'd with. At the &s;ame time, he had wrote to his Cou&s;in, to know the truth of the thing; upon which, the Officer re|ceiving &s;uch information, wrote him&s;elf to Mr. <HI>de Chateauneuf,</HI> &s;etting forth, That he was ready to return to <HI>France,</HI> to clear him&s;elf of the Accu&s;ation, if the King would grant him a Pa&s;&s;|port, and A&s;&s;urance that he &s;hould not be troubled upon the &s;core of his retiring to a foreign Counn|try, contrary to his Prohibition.</P>
<P>This Letter was but ju&s;t receiv'd, and the Re|lation having been at <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> that day, told all the People about the Inn, the whole Story as a piece of acceptable News: But the Recollet was wi&s;er than to di&s;cover what hand he had in the matter. Upon that, he drop'd his De&s;ign of go|ing to wait upon Mr. <HI>Chateauneuf,</HI> and took up at another Inn under a different Name from what he had before: Nay, further, he bought &s;uch a Cro&s;s as the Knights of <HI>Malta</HI> wear, and put a white Feather in his Hat, and went by the Title of Mr. <HI>le Chevalier.</HI> The People of the fir&s;t Inn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eeing him next day, were &s;urpriz'd, for that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> had told them nothing of his going. But, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">, the Officer's Kin&s;man had never &s;u&s;|pected
<PB N="185" REF="311">
him, if the Recollet had not &s;aid at Ta|ble, that he came from <HI>Languedoc;</HI> for &s;ome|body telling him &s;o much, happen'd, by way of Je&s;t, to &s;ay, That, perhaps, he was the Man he had been &s;peaking of, and for that rea&s;on had de&s;erted the Inn. Upon this, the Kin&s;man re|turn'd next day to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> to know what &s;ort of a Man the Recollet was. Mr. <HI>Chateauneuf</HI>'s De&s;cription agreeing exactly with what he had &s;een, he acquainted the Mini&s;ter with what pa&s;s'd at Table, and with the &s;u&s;picion that he ground|ed thereupon. Immediately the Secretary gave &s;uch expre&s;s Orders for &s;earching all the Inns in <HI>Paris,</HI> that the Recollet could &s;carce e&s;cape: For the excellent Orders we have in this City, with reference to all &s;trangers, whether in Inns, or private Lodgings, are &s;o admirably well cal|culated, that 'tis no great difficulty to make a narrow Enquiry: All the Landlords being oblig|ed to give an account who are their Lodgers, and when they arriv'd; the Commi&s;&s;ary of the Ward where the pretended Knight lodg'd, was inform|ed by the Inn-keeper, that he had got a new Gue&s;t. Thereupon the Commi&s;&s;ary ob&s;erving the time of his arrival, to jump with that of the &s;u&s;pected Per&s;on's, he inform'd him&s;elf of his Features, and &s;o took him up; &s;o that his pre|tended Knight-hood was not &s;ufficient to keep him <HI>Incognito.</HI> Pre&s;ently he was convey'd either to the <HI>Ba&s;tile</HI> or <HI>Vincennes,</HI> where he endeavour|ed to make his e&s;cape; but being prevented, and being at the &s;ame time guilty of a horrid piece of Sacrilege, he was indited according to his de|merit. The Recollets interceeded for him, to prevent the mortification of its being &s;aid in the World, That one of their Society was either Hang'd or Burnt. The King graciou&s;ly granted their reque&s;t, and exchang'd the Sentence of Death for that of perpetual Impri&s;onment. So
<PB N="159" REF="312">
he was put into the Ho&s;pital I &s;poke of but now; but he was no &s;ooner got in, than he made a new Con&s;piracy with the other Ru&s;&s;ians to make their e&s;cape; now, this could &s;carce be effected without Killing him that brought 'em their Vi|ctuals. But that being not the fir&s;t Crime they had all been guilty of, they mutually agreed, that they &s;hould not &s;tand to do it. In effect, they committed the Murder, and having made their e&s;cape, fled to the <HI>Palais Royal</HI> where they had an acquaintance by whom they expected to be entertain'd. But their Acquaintance abhorring the Crime they had committed, and knowing they had broke the Pri&s;on to which they had been com|mitted by the King's Orders, refus'd to receive 'em. Thus they were oblig'd to look out for another hiding Place: But the Goal-Keeper be|ing already at their Heels, they were quickly re|taken and Tried. The poor Recollet, by vertue of the Intere&s;t of his Order, was only Condemn|ed to the Galleys; but God not contented with this Puni&s;hment which was infinitely &s;hort of his demerit, did &s;o order it, that the Gang offering to revolt again&s;t their Keepers, about fifteen or twenty Leagues from <HI>Paris,</HI> the&s;e &s;hot upon 'em, and Kill'd the wretched Recollet. Such was his End, and the King having notice of it, was the more forward in reforming the Almo|ners of the Army; for that he knew 'twas in that capacity that he fir&s;t began to &s;ignalize him|&s;elf by Debauchery and Corruptne&s;s,</P>
<P>In the mean time, we receiv'd the News of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Death, which gave the Potentates that de&s;ir'd a Peace, &s;ome occa&s;ion to fear &s;ome ob&s;tacle, or delay. But tho' his Succe&s;&s;or was very young; and 'twas to be fear|ed, that a great many Turmoils might fall out in that Kingdom, during his Minority; yet his Father's Will was &s;o well order'd, that it put
<PB N="160" REF="313">
all to rights. His Son was declar'd to be <HI>Ma|jor,</HI> or of Age, before the u&s;ual Term in <HI>Swe|den,</HI> in order to di&s;courage tho&s;e who mean'd to di&s;turb the State. At the &s;ame time, the young King's Grandmother being declar'd his Guardian by her Son's Will, took upon her the Ad|mini&s;tration of the Government. The late King had nominated &s;ome Coun&s;ellors to a&s;&s;i&s;t her; among the re&s;t the Count of <HI>Bielke,</HI> a zealous favourer of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> who had been formerly Amba&s;&s;ador at the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and was di&s;oblig'd there. However, it being fear'd that he might endeavour to di&s;turb our Game, perhaps as much out of private re&s;ent|ment, as any intention to &s;erve the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> Count; <HI>d'Avaux,</HI> the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King's Amba&s;&s;ador in that Country, had orders to have a watchful Eye upon his Conduct. I know not whether it was the bad Offices done him by Count <HI>d'Avaux,</HI> or his being guilty of &s;everal unwarrantable Practices when he was Governor of <HI>Pomeren,</HI> that brought him quickly to be di&s;grac'd; but, in fine, he perceiving that he was like to &s;ink under the Power of his Enemies, wrote to one of his Nephews in <HI>France,</HI> to in|treat his Maie&s;ty to forget what was pa&s;t, and grant him the honour of his Protection. Im|mediately, upon the receipt of the Letter, his Nephew &s;poke of it to the King: And the Count's hopes were not fru&s;trated; for the King allow|ed him to come to <HI>France,</HI> pur&s;uant to his re|que&s;t; but the Letter, by which his Nephew gave him this Advice, being intercepted by &s;ome of his Enemies, he was taken up.</P>
<P>At that time, Mr. <HI>La&s;un</HI> had only two Oc|cupations, namely, Pleading and Gaming. But as he grew Old, Fortune, which only &s;erves Youth, became as unfavourable to him as it had formerly been kind. 'Twas computed, that in
<PB N="161" REF="314">
the &s;pace of three or four Months he lo&s;t a|bove &s;ixty thou&s;and Pi&s;tols. 'Tis certain he lo&s;t a great deal; but it being known that &s;ixty thou|&s;and Pi&s;tols, in the <HI>Ga&s;cogne</HI> way of &s;peaking, does not amount to above five or &s;ix thou&s;and, others concluded that his lo&s;s might terminate there. He was likewi&s;e ca&s;t in a Law-Suit a|gain&s;t Madam <HI>Fremont,</HI> and her Son; and was more ca&s;t down upon that, than upon his lo&s;s at Game; for he &s;till hop'd to regain the lat|ter, but the Judgment again&s;t him excluded all hopes of relief. Be&s;ides, he was troubled that he had made &s;uch a noi&s;e about it, both at Court, and in the City, without better &s;ucce&s;s. All his Friends endeavoured to comfort him; and, to &s;peak the truth, they were not much di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied with the rub he met with, becau&s;e they hop'd it would facilitate his Accommodation with Mar&s;hal <HI>de Lorges</HI> and his Lady. But &s;tiffne&s;s is &s;o natural to old People, that their hopes vani&s;h'd in Smoak. He was a turbulent &s;ort of a Man all his Life-time; in&s;omuch, that he oftentimes thwarted the King: and he would not then di&s;claim that Quality, tho', indeed, 'twas none of the be&s;t. The Judgment pro|nounced again&s;t him, related only to the Que&s;ti|on, whether he was to plead before the Court of <HI>Aydes,</HI> or that of <HI>Reque&s;ts.</HI> Now, being re|mitted to the la&s;t, which was the thing he on|ly wanted to avoid, he re&s;olv'd to plead his Cau&s;e there, tho' he &s;hould meet with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s that happen'd to him in <HI>Ireland.</HI> Tho', after all' I know not what rea&s;on he had to fear any &s;uch thing; for he &s;hew'd, by his Car|riage before them, that he fear'd K. <HI>William</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uch le&s;s than them.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="315">
However, he was not the only Courtier that lov'd to be litigious. The P. of <HI>Epinois</HI> fol|low'd his Example very clo&s;e. He commenc'd a Suit before the Council again&s;t the Prince of <HI>Bournonville,</HI> for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Vicounty of <HI>Gand,</HI> to which they were equally related. The ca&s;e had been already decided by the Par|liament of <HI>Rouan,</HI> in favour of the Prince of <HI>Bournonville.</HI> But great Lords are more liable to the pur&s;uit of ill Cau&s;es than others, be|cau&s;e their Intendants and Agents want only to have 'em ingag'd to a di&s;advantage, that they may fi&s;h in troubled Waters. His true Friends gave him to know, That they fear'd he would he ca&s;t before the Council, as well as before the Par|liament. Upon this, he redoubled his Sollici|tations, hoping by his Intrigues and diligence to gain what he was apprehen&s;ive of lo&s;ing in the Court of Ju&s;tice. The two Prince&s;&s;es, his Wife and his Mother, took care likewi&s;e to make u&s;e of their Friends. His Wife endea|voured to per&s;wade 'em, that &s;he de&s;ired nothing but Ju&s;tice, hoping to blind 'em by their re|&s;pect for her Quality. But the Mother was le&s;s pre&s;umptuous, whether 'twas that &s;he thought &s;he was no longer to be con&s;ider'd as a Prin|ce&s;s, having the Reputation of being married to a Lawyer, or that &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of the weakne&s;s of her Son's Cau&s;e: Accordingly &s;he confin'd her hopes to the Intere&s;t of her pre|tended Husband. The P. of <HI>Bournonville,</HI> for his part, was not a&s;leep, being &s;en&s;ible that he had to do with a &s;trong party: But 'twould be a great folly in Judges to have more re|gard to Intere&s;t than Ju&s;tice; and all that the Prince <HI>D'Epinois,</HI> and his whole Family could do, could not prevent his being fin'd, and oblig'd to pay the Co&s;ts. Indeed the Debate la&s;ted a|bove
<PB N="163" REF="316">
five Hours, becau&s;e &s;ome of the Judges had a mind to oblige 'em.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>Grignan</HI> being then at <HI>Paris,</HI> went to &s;ee the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Or|leans</HI> at St. <HI>Cloud,</HI> who had Di&s;located her Arm, by a Fall from her Hor&s;e at Hunt|ing: But &s;he was &s;o ill receiv'd, that &s;he did not care to go again for a long time. That Prince&s;s came to that Hou&s;e, after her Arm had been &s;et by a Country Sur|geon, that perform'd his Office not ami&s;s: But being &s;till much Pain'd, &s;he was &s;o angry at the Counte&s;s's &s;aying to her, That &s;he came to Congratulate the di&s;|pelling of her Illne&s;s, that &s;he was very near kicking her out of her Pre&s;ence. The Prince&s;s, who &s;eldom di&s;gui&s;es Na|ture, check'd her &s;o &s;everely, that the Counte&s;s, upon her return to <HI>Paris,</HI> made it known to all her Friends, and the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> came to hear of it. His Royal Highne&s;s told his Lady, That &s;he was in the wrong; but &s;he was &s;o un|capable of li&s;tning to Rea&s;on in the ca&s;e &s;he was in, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of waiting till &s;he was well, before &s;he could be convinced of an Error, in having us'd that Lady at &s;ueh a rate.</P>
<P>The Month of <HI>August</HI> came on &s;oon af|ter; and the Je&s;uits, in pur&s;uance of their

The Pa&s;&s;ion that the good Fathers had for in&s;inuating them&s;elves in the King's Favour, made them prefer Flattery to Gratitude. They have forgot, that their Founders oblig'd them to put their Name upon the Gate, and have put up another in its place; which, indeed, is infinitely greater, and more illu&s;trious than <HI>Clermont</HI>'s; but, at the &s;ame time, did not want Panegyri&s;ts enough be&s;ides them, to tran&s;mit it with Honour to Po&s;terity: So that the World did not pardon &s;uch an Action; for they had no &s;ooner taken down the Name of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> from above their great Gate, than two Latin Ver&s;es were Publi&s;hed which are well enough known in the World; but there being &s;everal that have not &s;een them, 'twill not be altogether improper to in&s;ert them here, and to pre&s;erve the Memory of them if it were capable to be lo&s;t: They are as followeth.<Q><L>Su&s;tulit hinc Je&s;um, Po&s;uit&abque; in&s;ignia Regis,</L><L>Impia Genes; alium non habt illa Deum.</L></Q></P>

The meaning of the&s;e Ver&s;es, is, That this So|ciety in which Impiety reigns, took down the Name of Je&s;us, and put up the King's Arms; and &s;o ne|ver recogniz'd any other God than the Kings of the Earth. I am very far from &s;aying that this is a truth. Nay, I &s;hould rather affirm, that Piety reigns among 'em in&s;tead of Impiety: but con&s;idering that they have many Enemies, we mu&s;t not be &s;urpris'd if they have recour&s;e to &s;ome Impo&s;ture or other, when the &s;malle&s;t Faults they can be guilty of, are charg'd upon 'em with Reproach. However, <HI>Mon|&s;ieur</HI> being invited to the abovemention'd Tragedy, he and the whole Court honour'd it with their Pre|&s;ence; upon which Father <HI>Jai,</HI> who has a great Genius for that &s;ort of Repre&s;entation, complimen|ted him on the behalf of the Rector of that Col|lege, &s;etting forth, that if the Performance pleas'd him, all the Honour of it was due to him. The good Father made a long tedious Speech, &s;crewing in &s;everal Panegyricks upon the late Duke of <HI>S. Ag|nan,</HI> who was not only a great lover of Acting, but &s;o good an Actor, that upon occa&s;ion he acted all the different Parts one after another. Having &s;poke all that he had to &s;ay, he took leave, and went to cau&s;e the Repre&s;entation to be begun. But when every one was pricking up his Ears, that they might not lo&s;e one word of the Performance, this mighty Inventer fell out with his Fidlers, in&s;omuch, that in&s;tead of Playing, they put up their In&s;tru|ments, and offer'd to go away. Father <HI>Jai</HI> being touch'd with the Affront they thus put upon him, preach'd to 'em, and catechiz'd 'em, in order to make 'em alter their Re&s;olution. But after he had thus acted the part of a Preacher, a Trade that in the mean time he knew nothing of, he at la&s;t came to threaten 'em with his Arms, where his greater Excellency lay. He gave the Mu&s;icians to know, that the lea&s;t they could expect, was, to have their In&s;truments broke over their Heads. But all this did

Accordingly <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> interpos'd his Au|thority, and the Mu&s;icians did for him what they refus'd to do for the Father: Then the Tragedy was begun, but its end was much of a piece with the Prelude. For &s;everal People quarell'd, and were &s;o warm, that they &s;tood in need of <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI>'s Authority to re&s;train 'em. However, the Matter was accommodated without <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI>'s Intervention; and the King who loves to be inform'd of all that pa&s;&s;es in <HI>Paris</HI> or <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> no &s;ooner had an ac|count of the Adventures at this Tragedy, but he &s;aid a word of <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> that &s;ounded well enough.

<P>The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Orleans</HI> did not keep his Anger long; whether it was that he was &s;en&s;ible of his Error in being angry, or that he was not apt to continue a Re&s;entment long.

But his Nephew, who would not &s;acrifice his Hopes of a Bi&s;hoprick to the love he had for his Uncle, renew'd his Addre&s;&s;es to Father <HI>de la Chai&s;e,</HI> and to the King.

the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Mentz,</HI> which is none of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable Sees in the Kingdom; for be&s;ides that the Bi&s;hop of that place is at the &s;ame time Prince of the Empire, and has a right to put the Sword as well as the Mitre in his Arms, like the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Electors, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> and &s;everal other Princes; his Incomes amount to almo&s;t 80000 Livres a Year. The elde&s;t Brother of the late Duke of <HI>Feuillade</HI> had &s;ucceeded to it, when the Duke of <HI>Verneuil,</HI> who had enjoy'd it from his Youth, married Duke <HI>Sulli</HI>'s Widow.

This entirely put an end to what chagrin the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Orleans</HI> retain'd upon the &s;core of the Bank. However, his Maje&s;ty, who never does a Favour by halves, ob&s;erving that neither this new Prelate, nor his Family, were in a Condition to rai&s;e the 20000 Crowns that he was oblig'd to &s;end to <HI>Rome</HI> for his Bulls; his Maje&s;ty, I &s;ay, ta|king this into Con&s;ideration, intreated the Pope by a Letter under his own Hand, to let this Prelate have his Bulls <HI>gratis.</HI> If the King had gratified him with this rich Benefice five or &s;ix Months later than he did, he might have &s;av'd him&s;elf the trouble of writing to <HI>Rome,</HI> for the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Orleans</HI> was made Cardinal before that time, and the Cardinal's Ne|phews never pay for their Bulls, that being a Privi|lege among many others that is tack'd to the Purple.

<P><PB N="164" REF="323">
The <HI>Tuilleries</HI> are the place of Rendezvous for all the Per&s;ons of Quality of Fortune in <HI>Paris:</HI> And at pre&s;ent, 'tis a Cu&s;tom among the Ladies, as well as the Gentlemen, to keep Footmen from 25 to 30 Years of Age; and commonly at the Gates and Doors there &s;tands &s;uch a numerous quantity of Footmen, as upon occa&s;ion would make a Recruit of 4 or 5000 Men. Now, the&s;e Gentlemen Lac|quies having the daily Opportunity of &s;eeing the Freaks and Intrigues of their Mi&s;tri&s;&s;es, and having no great rea&s;on to entertain a very good Opinion of 'em, one may know the Hi&s;tory of each Lady by hearing their Conferences. At that time, one of the&s;e Comical Fellows &s;aid to his Fellow Servants, that if they would give him a Bottle of Wine, he would lift up the Coats of the fir&s;t Lady that came out. They readily agreed to give that reward for &s;uch a nice piece of Diver&s;ion. In the mean time, Mademoi&s;elle <HI>d' Armagnac,</HI> and the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Villequier</HI> came out together; and the Footman, probably not knowing who they were, offer'd to perform upon them the In&s;olence he had promis'd. The Ladies &s;urpriz'd with the unaccount|able Brutality, cry'd out for help, and &s;topp'd the Footman them&s;elves; &s;everal Per&s;ons of Quality alighting from their Coaches, a&s;&s;i&s;ted them to prevent the Fellow's making his E&s;cape; upon this he was impri&s;on'd&punc; Some Judges were for putting him to Death, to &s;care tho&s;e of his Kidney from &s;uch lewd|ne&s;s; but others thought the Pillory and the Gallies a &s;ufficient Puni&s;hment for what he had done. And thus he was only order'd to go and &s;erve the King in the Gallies; though, to &s;peak the truth, his In&s;o|lence de&s;erv'd another &s;ort of u&s;age. However, that wretched &s;ort of Cattel entertain'd the Publick very often with Scenes of this nature, which were &s;till wor&s;e when they wore Swords. Every day they were guilty of &s;ome In&s;olence or other, and there was a great deal of rea&s;on for forbidding 'em
<PB N="165" REF="324">
the u&s;e of Swords. The occa&s;ion of that Prohibi|tion was the Father of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tilladet,</HI> whom they kill'd, and &s;o &s;topp'd the Cour&s;e of his Fortune, which perhaps would have gone further than that of his Children, becau&s;e he had married the Si&s;ter of the late Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Tellier.</HI> 'Tis true, he was not al|ways in good terms with him. That Mini&s;ter, who&s;e Projects bore a Proportion to his Fortune, pretend|ed to Marry his Si&s;ter better than to a little Gentle|man of <HI>Ga&s;cony.</HI> But young Ladies often Marry without their Friends Con&s;ent, and &s;he particularly di&s;pos'd of her &s;elf without con&s;ulting him upon the matter. This was the occa&s;ion of their mi&s;un|der&s;tanding. But as time &s;inks all Differences, &s;o his Brother-in-law and he were good Friends when that accident happen'd.</P>
<P>At that time the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Feuillade</HI> dy'd; and her Death was not much regreated by her Husband, who, if we believe the common Report, liv'd &s;o indifferently with her, that he never injoy'd her. But though he did not lament her lo&s;s, all that knew her did, for &s;he was a very amiable Lady, and never gave any occa&s;ion to talk of her. Be&s;ides, &s;he was very Young, being not above 20 Years of Age. But there are &s;ome invincible Antipathies; and 'tis plain, the Duke was not of a Temper &s;uit|able to her, &s;ince he did not re&s;pect what all the World pronounc'd lovely. It &s;eems he likewi&s;e de|&s;pis'd her Alliance; though, to &s;peak the truth, there were a great many of as good Families as his at lea&s;t, who would willingly have married Ladies that had not &s;o much to boa&s;t of as &s;he. For if 'tis true, that a Family is render'd Illu&s;trious by the pa&s;t or pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great Places; we &s;hall &s;carce find one in the Kingdom, at lea&s;t retaining to the Law, that could equal this. It produc'd &s;ix or &s;even Secretaries of State, and at pre&s;ent boa&s;ts of three. This Lady was the Daughter of the Mar|qui&s;s of <HI>Chateauneuf,</HI> who, indeed, is but a little

Secretary of State, in compari&s;on with the other three. But as there are no little Saints in Paradi&s;e, becau&s;e God, who is infinitely Great, communicates &s;omewhat of him&s;elf to tho&s;e who have &s;erv'd him faithfully, &s;o there's no &s;uch thing, as a little Secre|tary of State, under the greate&s;t King in <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI></P>
<P>Mean while, Mar&s;hal <HI>Boufflers</HI> and my Lord <HI>Port|land</HI> having remov'd a great many Difficulties by their Conferences; the King in concert with the Emperor, propos'd to keep <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> and to give up to his Imperial Maje&s;ty that Part of <HI>Bri&s;ack</HI> that lies beyond the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The City of <HI>Strasbourg</HI> did not belong to the Emperor, and by right it ought to have return'd to the Inhabitants, who were Pro|prietors of it, before the King had it. This Inno|vation did not plea&s;e the Princes of the Empire, e&s;pecially tho&s;e &s;ituated on this &s;ide the <HI>Rhine,</HI> or ju&s;t by the other. But great Princes do not much mind little ones, when their own Intere&s;t is in the ca&s;e; and upon that foot the Con&s;ent of the King of <HI>England</HI> was enough to make it bear. 'Tis al|ledg'd that that Prince con&s;ented to it, only upon the hopes that his &s;atisfying the King of <HI>France</HI> in a thing that he de&s;ir'd &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately, would move his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty to give him ano|ther recompence that he on the other &s;ide, was as eager to obtain He did not like King <HI>James</HI>'s con|tinuing at St. <HI>Germains,</HI> thinking that place to lie too near <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI> And upon a parallel Ca&s;e, <HI>Crom|well</HI> who was not &s;hort of him in Politicks, us'd all his Intere&s;t in his time to oblige his Maje&s;ty to re|move from his Court, not only the late King <HI>Charles,</HI> who after his Father's Misfortune had fled to <HI>Paris,</HI> but likewi&s;e the Queen his Mother. Accordingly he obtain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d his end with reference to King <HI>Charles,</HI> and even the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> his Brother, who had likewi&s;e fled thither; but as to the Queen he could never gain his Point there, notwith&s;tanding that he wheedled Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> with the Propo&s;al of a
<PB N="167" REF="326">
Marriage between his own Son and one of the Cardinal's Nieces. For that Prince&s;s made a vigo|rous Oppo&s;ition again&s;t this Mini&s;ter's Propo&s;al of her removal from the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and would never con&s;ent to it, notwith&s;tanding the great Ad|vantages accruing to her upon that Condition, particularly a large Pen&s;ion from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Portland</HI> gave the Mar&s;hal &s;ome hint of his Ma&s;ter's De&s;ign, with a good Addre&s;s. The Mar|&s;hal, who is not &s;o much a State&s;man as a good Ser|vant to the King, had neverthele&s;s Sen&s;e enough up|on this Occa&s;ion to give him &s;ome hopes of &s;ucceed|ing without going too far. However, People being always apt to flatter them&s;elves, my Lord was per|&s;waded, That the King could not refu&s;e what King <HI>William</HI> de&s;ir'd, after the Conde&s;cention in the Af|fair of <HI>Strasbourg;</HI> and nothing was thought of upon both &s;ides, but the Execution of what the&s;e two Mini&s;ters &s;hould agree upon. The Princes of the Empire were &s;till di&s;pleas'd; they could not forbear complaining that the Article relating to <HI>Strasbourg</HI> was contrary to the Preliminaries of the Peace; they knew very well that the fir&s;t thing de|manded of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Cailleres</HI> before the Commence|ment of the Conferences with him, was the Re&s;ti|tution of <HI>Lorrain, Strasbourg,</HI> and <HI>Luxembourg.</HI> The Emperor's Mini&s;ters an&s;wer'd to this, That the King's Conque&s;t of <HI>Barcelona</HI> had chang'd the Face of Affairs, that he demanded an Equivalent, and that con&s;idering how things &s;tood, 'twas well for them that he was contented with &s;o little. They were glad they had this Pretence to cover the Ad|vantage accruing to their Ma&s;ter by that new Pro|po&s;al. In fine, they &s;aw very well, that after all <HI>Europe</HI> had drain'd it &s;elf in carrying on the War, the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> were the only Gainers by it. But the Princes of the Empire, who did not ap|prove of the&s;e Rea&s;ons, could not comply &s;o ea&s;ily with the Propo&s;al. They &s;ollicited the Emperor and
<PB N="168" REF="327">
the Mediators, to get that Clau&s;e alter'd that &s;eem'd to be &s;o di&s;advantageous to them. His Imperial Ma|je&s;ty did not mind them; for that in granting their Reque&s;t, he &s;hould have acted contrary to his own Intere&s;t. The Mediators gave no other excu&s;e, but that all <HI>Europe</HI> &s;tood equally in need of a Peace, and that the Ce&s;&s;ion of all on this &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and &s;tipulating a Re&s;titution of all on the other &s;ide, was the be&s;t Expedient, both to put a &s;peedy end to the pre&s;ent War, and to prevent a future Rup|ture.</P>
<P>Neither their An&s;wer, nor that of the Emperors, gave 'em any Satisfaction. They fan&s;y'd the Medi|ators were influenc'd by <HI>France;</HI> at lea&s;t they per|&s;waded them&s;elves, that if the late King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had been &s;till alive, he would never have tamely &s;uffer'd things to pa&s;s &s;o. Being thus prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the apprehen&s;ion of the great Prejudice accruing to them from the Peace, they did not comply very early. While the re&s;pective Parties were bu&s;i'd in managing their &s;everal Preten&s;ions, the Affairs of <HI>Poland</HI> were brought to that Confu&s;ion, that 'twas thought they would never be adju&s;ted without a Civil War. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cardinal Primate &s;ent a Courier to <HI>France,</HI> to know what was the rea&s;on that the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> did not come to take the Crown upon his Head. He repre&s;ented, that his Intere&s;t &s;uffer'd mightily by his apparent Indifferency in ly|ing quiet at <HI>Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> or the Court, at a time when <HI>Poland</HI> was in a Combu&s;tion out of Re&s;pect and Love to him. That the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> was not wanting in reaping a mighty Advantage by it; that he de|bauch d tho&s;e of his Party, upon the Plea that 'twould be folly to adhere any longer to a <HI>Prince</HI> that de&s;erted 'em in that manner; that his Pre&s;ence in <HI>Poland</HI> was de&s;ir'd beyond Expre&s;&s;ion; and that on the other hand, the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> was &s;o hated, that upon the Prince's Arrival every body would &s;ide with him out of &s;pite to the other.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="328">
The Abbot of <HI>Polignac</HI> gave the Court to know as much by every Courier he &s;ent. At la&s;t, the King having call'd a Council upon the matter, re|&s;olv'd that the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> &s;hould go immediate|ly to that Country. And in regard he could not expect a good Reception without carrying Money with him, his Maje&s;ty gave him Bills of Exchange for 2000000, be&s;ides 10000 <HI>Louis-d'ores,</HI> for petty Occa&s;ions. The Peace was then not made, and 'twas po&s;&s;ible it might fail, by rea&s;on of the Intere&s;t of the Princes of the Empire, who &s;till oppos'd it with great Warmth and Re&s;olution. Upon this ac|count 'twas que&s;tion'd by many, how the Prince &s;hould get with &s;afety into <HI>Poland.</HI> To go there <HI>in|cognito</HI> was at once di&s;honourable and dangerous, and to do it by open force was impo&s;&s;ible, the Ene|mies Fleet being at Sea, which all the Power of <HI>France</HI> could not cope with. But notwith&s;tanding the Strength of their Fleet, the Kng fitted out Squadrons every Day, which not only got off clear, but were continually annoying them by taking Prizes. And accordingly a Squadron was order'd to Tran&s;port the Prince: <HI>John Bart</HI> having taken upon him to Conduct the Prince, took care to make the Squadron ready by Orders from Court. 'Twas fitted out at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and the Allies having notice of it, &s;ent 14 Ships to that Road, to hinder any thing to go in, or come out. This Ob&s;tacle did not amu&s;e <HI>John Bart,</HI> though another would have been much perplex'd with it. 'Tis not known how the Enemy had &s;uch an early Intelligence of the De&s;ign, for the King kept it &s;o &s;ecret that no body in <HI>France</HI> knew of it, till within two Days before the time of his Departure. However, it &s;eems, it came by Spies, of which they had a great many every where, e&s;pecially at the Sea-Ports.</P>
<P>But that Trade was more hazardous than <HI>Bart</HI>'s Expedition, though at the &s;ame time it was attend|ed by a great deal of Danger. For one of the&s;e Spie

was taken up, not long before, in the &s;ame place where this Squadron was fitted out; and con&s;idering the ri&s;que he run, 'tis not imaginable how little he got by it. One <HI>Couture,</HI> a <HI>Paris-</HI>Councellor, a Man of little Practice, and a narrow Fortune, being in|veigled by a Woman, that either had debauch'd him, or had been debauch'd by him, went a &s;trow|ling up and down the Country with her. There he try'd &s;everal Trades that did not agree very well with the Bar; but being bred to Harangue and De|claim, he at la&s;t li&s;ted him&s;elf among a Company of &s;trowling Actors, which after a great many turnings and windings brought him to the <HI>French Flanders;</HI> there he acted his Parts, and coming afterwards to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> met there with a Man that having known him at <HI>Paris,</HI> repre&s;ented to him the &s;candalou&s;ne&s;s of his Imployment. The Coun&s;ellor-Actor made an&s;wer, <HI>That 'twas ea&s;y to talk of things, but when a Man had nothing, he was oblig'd to do what he could.</HI> Thereupon his Friend gave him to know, that if he would tru&s;t him, he would find him a better Trade, in which he might earn his Bread with le&s;s La|bour. The Coun&s;ellor being not over-&s;atisfied with the Trade he was then in, took him at his word; upon which his Friend &s;aid, <HI>They behov'd to drink together, before he could &s;peak farther upon the Matter.</HI> Having carried him to a Tavern, he acquainted him over a Gla&s;s, That he had &s;everal Relations in <HI>Holland,</HI> who were great Traders, and were every day annoy'd with the Prizes made by the <HI>French</HI> Ships; that they would willingly give 2000 Livers a Year to any Man that would engage to give 'em timely notice what Ships are fitting out from <HI>Dun|kirk</HI> and St. <HI>Maloes;</HI> that if he would find a Friend to re&s;ide in one of the&s;e places, while him&s;elf con|tinued in the other, he would &s;ee that Sum paid him; and that there was no great Difficulty or La|bour in the performance of what was de&s;ir'd. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible, he likewi&s;e &s;et forth to him, that in under|taking
<PB N="171" REF="330">
that Office, he would do a charitable Acti|on, by pre&s;erving &s;o many hone&s;t Men from Ruin. However the Coun&s;ellor accepted the offer, and &s;ettled one <HI>Martin</HI> for his Sub-delegate at St. <HI>Maloes,</HI> allowing him 500 Livres a Year: Him&s;elf con|tinued at <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> waiting till he could find out another Deputy for the &s;ame price, that &s;o he might go to <HI>Paris;</HI> and there injoy the remaining 1000 Livres of his Pen&s;ion. Accordingly he found one in a little time. But his other Deputy, Mr. <HI>Martin,</HI> being a Man of no great Head, and his Office requiring an Infinity of Sen&s;e and Precaution, he was &s;oon &s;u&s;pected by the Inhabitants of St. <HI>Maloes.</HI> Tho' he colour'd his Re&s;idence in that place with a pre|tence of &s;ome &s;mall Commerce and Trade, that he had taken up only for a feint; yet they ob&s;erving his Diligence and Curio&s;ity in going every Day to the Haven to &s;ee what was done there, immediately gave the Court notice of him. The Court &s;ent Orders to have a watchful Eye upon him. At la&s;t, their Su&s;picion being &s;till inflam'd by his Conduct, they &s;topp'd his Letters at the Po&s;t-hou&s;e, which were addre&s;s'd to <HI>Couture</HI> at one Madam <HI>Clerc</HI>'s in <HI>Paris.</HI> At the &s;ame time, Letters were &s;ent to <HI>Cou|ture</HI> from his other Corre&s;pondent at <HI>Dunkirk:</HI> Both the&s;e were open'd, and afterwards &s;eal'd &s;o artifici|ally, that he could not di&s;cover it.

After that, 'twas found that the u&s;e he made of their Intelligence, was to convey the &s;ame to <HI>Holland.</HI> This being &s;ufficient Evidence, they were all three taken up: Poor <HI>S.

in that Rank; but the one being as poor as a Rat, let his Family be what it will, and the other being a Cadet as well as he, and one who&s;e Family has nothing but a Chancellor for its greate&s;t Orna|ment, I thought I might di&s;pen&s;e with the giving 'em that Title. The latter a&s;&s;um'd the Name of Count <HI>Silleri</HI> at his Departure, either becau&s;e he hop'd the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> who&s;e Dome&s;tick he was, would rai&s;e him to a great Fortune now he was call'd to a Throne; or becau&s;e having declar'd his Marri|age with the Daughter of an Auditor of the Ac|counts, that brought him &s;ome Money, he had a mind to leave her a more honourable Title than that of a Chevalier's Lady. The Eve before the Prince's Departure, he receiv'd the Vi&s;its of all the Court, who came to take leave of him. At Night he &s;upp'd with the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> his Father-in-Law, and his whole Family; after which, a great many Tears were &s;hed, as if they &s;hould never &s;ee him again. Perhaps, they knew that he could not &s;et that Crown upon his Head without coming to the Point of the Sword, and con&s;equently that he had many Dangers to go through. And in earne&s;t that con&s;ideration is more than &s;ufficient to alarm tho&s;e who are concern'd for a Per&s;on; &s;o that if Tears be allowable upon any occa&s;ion, they are upon this. The Prince&s;s of <HI>Conti</HI> appear'd to be le&s;s mov'd than the re&s;t; or at lea&s;t, if &s;he &s;hed any Tears, they were not &s;o bitter as they might have been. Though there was no body that was &s;o nearly concern'd for the Prince as her &s;elf; yet &s;he thought it her Duty to behave her &s;elf &s;o, as to &s;eem worthy of the great Fortune to which &s;he a&s;pir'd. Not that &s;he did not love the Prince very tenderly; but be|&s;ides this her Ambition, and the De&s;ire of being a Queen, that had &s;o great a place in her Soul, &s;he was not ill pleas d to &s;ee the Prince go from Court. She knew too well that he was amorous to a fooli&s;h degree; and fed her &s;elf with the hopes that the re|moval

<P>The Prince rid Po&s;t to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> his Equipage being &s;ent before with all po&s;&s;ible Expedition. The Coffer which contain'd the 10000 Pi&s;tols that the King gave him, happen'd to be broke underneath, and the Pur&s;e in which they were being turn'd up&s;ide down, a great many of 'em were dropp'd about two are three Leagues from <HI>Paris.</HI> By chance, 'twas upon a Market-day that they were lo&s;t; and the <HI>Gonne&s;&s;e</HI> Bakers having found 'em, no &s;ooner under&s;tood who&s;e they were, than they deliver'd 'em up; for one of the Prince's Pages had come back to know if any body had found 'em. 'Tis alledg'd, that the Prince had purpo&s;ely left 3 or 400 Pi&s;tols out of the Bag, and put them in that &s;orry Coffer, in order to leave with tho&s;e that found 'em an eternal Memorial of his Departure from <HI>France.</HI> 'Tis true, he is likely enough to do &s;uch a thing, for he's as generous a Prince as any about the Court: And for that rea|&s;on, 'twas &s;aid of him, that if he &s;hew'd him&s;elf to be of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Conde</HI> by his Bravery, he would not do it by his Genero&s;ity. He took nothing to him&s;elf; and 'twas &s;uch a Prince as he that the <HI>Poles</HI> wanted, in order, to &s;ink the Memory of the Avarice of their late King, or rather to make 'em &s;en&s;ible how advantageous his earlier Arrival at the Throne had been to them; for he would never have &s;old a Palatinate, or any other Place; his Hu|mour was too much a &s;tranger to the &s;ordid Mea|&s;ures of their late King, or at lea&s;t, if ever he &s;hould take up with them, he mu&s;t needs be very much alter'd. <HI>Bart</HI> had prepar d every thing for putting to Sea, and &s;carce allow'd the Prince a few hours Sleep, till he weigh'd Anchor with a fair Wind.

All the Northern Princes were mightily concern'd about the Tran&s;actions in <HI>Poland,</HI> for all of 'em had Affairs to adju&s;t with that Crown. However, the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> did not act up to the Mea&s;ures of the re&s;t, who earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd that the Duke of <HI>Sax|ony</HI> &s;hould be preferr'd to this Prince; for he would never grant Audience to a Mini&s;ter that the Duke &s;ent to &s;ollicit him to hinder the Prince to enter the <HI>Baltick.</HI> He put him off with trifling Amu&s;e|ments, till the Prince had pa&s;t the <HI>Sundt,</HI> and then gave Audience to the Envoy; after which, he wait|ed with Patience and Tranquillity, till God &s;hould decide an Affair of that con&s;equence as he pleas'd. Some indeed alledge that he offer'd underhand &s;ome Ships to the Prince of <HI>Conti;</HI> and that the Prince only thank'd him for his good will, becau&s;e he thought he had no occa&s;ion for 'em, and that the Succe&s;s of his Expedition depended rather upon the Affection and good Will of the <HI>Poles,</HI> than upon any Succours he could receive from any other hand but the King, his Ma&s;ter. After all, the Prince arriv'd before <HI>Dantzick,</HI> being incourag'd to hope that the Inhabitants of that City would open their Gates to him. This City was to him, as 'twere, the Key of <HI>Poland;</HI> e&s;pecially if he &s;hould be oblig'd to di|&s;pute his Title to that Crown upon the point of the Sword. 'Twas by that place only that he could expect Succours from <HI>France,</HI> &s;ince the&s;e could not come otherwi&s;e than by Sea. But in&s;tead of an|&s;wering his Expectation, the Citizens &s;ent Deputies to intreat him not to come a&s;hoar in their Territo|ries; by rea&s;on that in the pre&s;ent State of Affairs, they could not declare either for him, or the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> without expo&s;ing them&s;elves to great ha|zards. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> did not con&s;true their Words literally, but as he ought to have done. He pre&s;ently perceiv'd that their Words in&s;inuated all the Enmity to him that could be; and that they had only di&s;guis'd their real Sentiments for fear of

di&s;plea&s;ing the King, who&s;e Power they were too well acquainted with, to draw it upon their own Heads. At the &s;ame time, &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Merchants that were &s;ettled there, came on Board his Ship, to offer him their Service in what their Power could reach, and a&s;&s;ur'd him that his Sentiments of the Matter were very ju&s;t. Nay, they gave him to know that the City had enter'd into a &s;trict Alliance with the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> by the Mediation of the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> who had &s;et it on foot as &s;oon as he re|ceiv'd Advice of his Election; That if they might freely di&s;clo&s;e their Thoughts to him, they would not advi&s;e him to go a&s;hoar any where, without a &s;trong <HI>French</HI> Army to guard his Per&s;on: That they knew not what Reports might have been &s;pread abroad to per&s;wade his Highne&s;s to come &s;o far, but they were afraid he would only have the trouble of returning without effecting any thing: That the <HI>Poles</HI> who were formerly Friends to the <HI>French,</HI> began to take up the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t them that other Nations had: That the Glory of the King had &s;truck them with fear as well as the others: That they were made to believe that the King a&s;pir'd to an Univer&s;al Monarchy; and that the fear of becoming his Subjects, &s;car'd them from preferring a Prince of his Blood to their Throne.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e Merchants had not given this Ac|count to the Prince, he had quickly found it out him&s;elf. In&s;tead of that croud of new Subjects that the Cardinal Primate had made him to expect be|fore his Departure from <HI>France,</HI> there came &s;carce any one to vi&s;it him on Board; mo&s;t of tho&s;e that came, were only mov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;o to do by their Curio&s;i|ty; &s;o that excepting a very &s;mall number that of|fer'd to pay him the u&s;ual Honours of Soveraignty, and treated him as King, there was no body that did any thing like it: But he would never &s;uffer either the&s;e, or his own Retinue to do it, for fear
<PB N="177" REF="336">
his Reign &s;hould be &s;hort-liv'd. He gave them to know, that he was not &s;o over-fond of a Crown, as to purcha&s;e it at the Expence of his Honour; that he only came thither in compliance with the Car|dinal Primate's Reque&s;t to Succour their Nation; which, as he alledg'd, the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> mean'd to oppre&s;s by a boundle&s;s Ambition; that the Car|dinal had promis'd to draw together an Army out of hand to inable him to &s;atisfy his de&s;ire; that when he &s;hould have done what he pretended to in &s;erving them, he would not then declin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he Title of their Defender; but as for that of King he would never accept of it, till things were upon another foot than what they were at that time; and indeed they could not be upon a wor&s;e foot than they were, with Reference to him. The Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> after his being proclaim'd King by his own Party, had not only po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of the City and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cracow,</HI> but likewi&s;e of that of <HI>War|&s;aw,</HI> where the Kings of <HI>Poland</HI> us'd to Re&s;ide. He had got him&s;elf Crown'd in one of the&s;e two places, partly by Force, and partly by good Will; while the Cardinal Primate prote&s;ted equally again&s;t his Coronation and his Election.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> finding that the Duke was thus Ma&s;ter of the Heart of the Country, and that <HI>Dantzick</HI> was but too partial to him, us'd all his Efforts to gain the Governor of <HI>Mariembourg,</HI> a place that was not far di&s;tant from the place where he was. Could he have ma&s;ter'd that, and been &s;uccour'd by his Party, he would have made it a place of Arms. The Governor of that place made as if he li&s;ten'd to his Propo&s;al, in order to make him &s;peak <HI>French;</HI> but the Prince being not in a Humour to do it without &s;eeing further into Affairs, gave him only conditional Promi&s;es; upon which the Governor, who had not yet made up Matters with the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> endeavour'd to do it, tho' without acquainting him that he did it, becau&s;e he
<PB N="178" REF="337">
could have no Security from his Rival. The Ge|nerals of the Army of the Crown, and that of <HI>Li|thuania,</HI> came likewi&s;e to feel the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Pul&s;e, and to try if they could finger his Bills of Exchange. They had hitherto pretended to enter|tain a Corre&s;pondence with the Abbot of <HI>Polignac,</HI> upon the magnificent Promi&s;es he had made 'em. That Amba&s;&s;ador thought he might promi&s;e any thing, &s;o as to &s;ecure this Crown, without ob&s;er|ving that he had to do with People as cunning as him&s;elf, and even engag'd under-hand to the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> from whom they expected to draw more con&s;iderable Sums than from him. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> had no mind to bid &s;o high as the Amba&s;&s;a|dor, becau&s;e lying is not the Character of a Prince, as it is of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters, who commonly think the direct contrary of what they &s;peak. Accordingly he reply'd, that he was oblig'd to them for the ten|der of their Service, but if they pretended to be paid before-hand, he willingly di&s;pens'd with it; that he was ready to bargain with them about what he &s;hould give 'em, provided they made his Election good; but if they mean'd only to take his Money, and afterwards to excu&s;e them&s;elves upon the Plea of the impo&s;&s;ibility of making good their promi&s;es, he would chu&s;e rather to keep his Money, than expo&s;e him&s;elf to future Repentance for giving it away to no purpo&s;e. The&s;e Generals, or rather their Deputies, hearing him &s;peak in this fa&s;hion, perceiv'd quickly that he was too long-headed for them; and having drop'd all de&s;igns of pulling a Feather from him, did under-hand advi&s;e the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> to endeavour by all po&s;&s;ible means to &s;eize upon his Per&s;on. To bring this about, in&s;tead of declaring openly for the Duke, they made their Ad|dre&s;s to the Cardinal Primate, as if they had been troubled to quit an Intere&s;t that they were joyn'd to by Inclination. The Cardinal &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be amus'd for &s;ome time by glittering Hopes, and
<PB N="179" REF="338">
even fed the Prince with them. He endeavour'd to per&s;uade him that he would &s;peedily &s;end him an Army capable to reduce the Duke of <HI>Saxony;</HI> which &s;hould oblige the Prince to wait the Execution of his Promi&s;es, notwith&s;tanding the Inconveniencies he &s;trugled with upon the Sea.</P>
<P>This Affair was &s;o long in dependance, that the Peace after dwindling for &s;ome Months, was con|cluded before it came to be determin'd. The Princes of the Empire were forc'd to &s;ubmit to the plea|&s;ure of &s;tronger Powers. The <HI>French</HI> recognis'd the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> as King of <HI>England;</HI> and that Prince coming then to the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Plenipotenti|aries of <HI>France</HI> began to pay him the Honour and Re&s;pect that was due to the Dignity they had ac|knowledg'd to be his. However, it happen'd that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Harlai</HI> being accu&s;tom'd to call him by another Name than that of King, us'd his wonted Expre&s;&s;ion in a Conference where he was pre&s;ent; but being at the &s;ame time &s;en&s;ible of his fault, he made the be&s;t Reparation he could. Madam <HI>Harlai,</HI> the Chancellor's Daughter, having gone to meet her Husband in <HI>Holland;</HI> and having the Curio&s;ity to &s;ee that Prince whom all the <HI>French</HI> have a parti|cular E&s;teem for, notwith&s;tanding the harm he has done 'em: This Lady, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> imploy'd &s;ome body to de&s;ire Audience of him in &s;ome place or other. The New King would not give it her at his own Apartments, but &s;ent her word to be at the Prince&s;s of <HI>Vaudemont</HI>'s at a certain hour. Madam <HI>Harlai</HI> had all the rea&s;on in the World to be &s;atisfied with his Civility and Courte&s;y. As for Mon&s;ieur <HI>Harlai,</HI> he to act the part of a good Courtier, acquainted my Lord <HI>Albemarle,</HI> his <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's new Favou|rite, who began then to have as great an A&s;cendant in the King's Affection, as ever my Lord <HI>Portland</HI> had: He acquainted him, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> That he de&s;ir'd his Ma&s;ter's Picture. My Lord <HI>Albemarle</HI> promis'd to give it him; but withal, intreated him to have pa|tience
<PB N="180" REF="339">
for &s;ome time, becau&s;e his Ma&s;ter was upon his Return to <HI>England,</HI> and he was afraid he could not &s;pare the time to let it be drawn. Whether that Lord forgot his Promi&s;e, or whether the King of <HI>Britain</HI> was &s;o taken up with Affairs of Con&s;e|quence, that my Lord could not have the opportu|nity of making good his Promi&s;e; whatever was in it, four or five Months pa&s;s'd, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Harlai</HI> had re&s;olv'd not to think of it farther, when he re|ceiv'd Information at <HI>Paris</HI> that my Lord's Trum|peter &s;taid in his Hall to &s;peak with him. At fir&s;t he could not conjecture what &s;hould bring him &s;o far from home, for he was far from thinking that his Ma&s;ter &s;hould have call'd to mind his Reque&s;t, after letting &s;o much time &s;lip without &s;ending to him. But after all, he found that his Errand was to bring him the Picture. My Lord had caus'd a magnificent Frame to be made for it at <HI>Paris,</HI> be|cau&s;e that &s;ort of Work is better done there than in <HI>England.</HI> The Trumpeter took care to let him know &s;o much, to &s;hew what Pains his Ma&s;ter took to content him. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Harlai</HI> thought this an odd way of conveying a Picture; but Foreigners have their peculiar Cu&s;toms as we have ours; and &s;o he was e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">en oblig'd to take the Complement to|gether with the Charges. He gave the Trumpeter a hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent; and that being all that this Me&s;|&s;enger wanted, he return'd forthwith to his own Country.</P>
<P>Of all the King's Plenipotentiaries at <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Harlai,</HI> as 'tis alledg'd, bore the lea&s;t Fi|gure as to Sen&s;e, but he bore the greate&s;t on another &s;core, I mean his Quality, and the fir&s;t places of the Robe, which for a long time have been fill'd by his Ance&s;tors. Upon this account he had had the whole, or at lea&s;t the greate&s;t part of the Honour of the Treaty, if the People had found any thing in it to their advantage: But 'twas &s;o far from that, that all Per&s;ons regreted &s;ecretly, and even pub|lickly
<PB N="181" REF="340">
all the Re&s;titutions that the King oblig'd him&s;elf to in that Treaty, as much as if they had been to part with their own E&s;tates. It mu&s;t be own'd that this fancy was in &s;ome mea&s;ure fooli&s;h; for, be&s;ides that his Maje&s;ty knew a great deal bet|ter than they what was convenient for him, and his Kingdom; according to all the mea&s;ures of good Sen&s;e, they ought to have de&s;ir'd nothing more than an end of the War, in order to prevent their being expos'd to the Evils they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity undergo, as long as it &s;hould continue. But, as People do not always act conformably to Rea&s;on, &s;o they made with Reluctancy the very Fire-works, that they were commanded to make, pur&s;uant to the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom upon all &s;uch Occa&s;ions. In&s;o|much that the Commi&s;&s;aries of the Wards were oblig'd to back their Injunctions with the Penalty of a large Fine; and without that they would never have agreed to it. However, even that did not &s;care 'em from cen&s;uring all that had been conclu|ded upon. To this purpo&s;e they handed about a pretty plea&s;ant Story, which &s;hew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d how little they were &s;atisfied with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Harlai</HI> That Magi|&s;trate had a Son that was as Foppi&s;h as his Father was Grave; for in earne&s;t, the Father re&s;embled the two Courtiers of whom Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Feuillade</HI> &s;aid, That when his Maje&s;ty had a mind to drink his Liquor cool, his Cup-bearers needed only to cool the Bottles by placing 'em between the&s;e two. This Son, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> was &s;o far from re&s;embling his Father, that he had always acted up to the Chara|cter I here give him. He was at <HI>Ry&s;wick</HI> when the Affairs of that Negotiation were brought to a Con|clu&s;ion; but neither the Solemnity of the place, nor his Father's Character could make him wi&s;er than u&s;ually. However, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Harlai</HI> having &s;ent him to the King with the News of the &s;igning of the Treaty, he &s;tay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;o long by the way, that the News were known at Court thirty Hours before
<PB N="182" REF="341">
his Arrival. This &s;lowne&s;s did not become a young Man, e&s;pecially one of &s;o much Fire, who us'd always to walk like Lightning. Upon which ac|count the World was amus'd with it, but at la&s;t they began to &s;ay, That they ought not to think it &s;trange, &s;ince for certain the Father was con|founded with the Son; that it was the Son that had made the Treaty, as appear'd from his Impati|ence in &s;igning it, notwith&s;tanding the prejudice it did to the King and the State; and that 'twas the Father who brought the News to Court, which was equally manife&s;t from the tediou&s;ne&s;s he &s;hew'd up|on the Road, for fear of wounding his Gravity. The principal foundation of this Raillery was, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were &s;o mortify'd by the taking of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> that they &s;ought for a Peace at any rate; and that whatever Propo&s;al the <HI>French</HI> Plenipoten|tiaries &s;hould have made after an Action of that im|portance, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would have agreed to it, and con&s;ented that the King &s;hould retain <HI>Luxemburg</HI> as an equivalent for that place, if the Plenipotentia|ries had been &s;o wi&s;e, as to take the advantage of the Con&s;ternation they were in.</P>
<P>Though the People by this Conduct &s;eem'd to controul the King's Actions, yet his Maje&s;ty was not ill pleas'd to find 'em of that mind. For as it was a Mark of their Folly, &s;o it &s;hew'd their con|cern for his Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t. Whatever was in it, they &s;carce had the &s;en&s;e to ob&s;erve that neither Mon&s;ieur <HI>Harlai,</HI> nor any of his Collegues, had done any thing without the King's Orders. But we mu&s;t not pretend that that &s;ort of Cattle are ever govern'd by Rea&s;on; Capricio and Humour is the ordinary Standard and Rule of their Thoughts. In effect, tho&s;e who but two Months before cry'd out for a Peace with all the Pa&s;&s;ion imaginable, had no &s;ooner got it, but they wi&s;h'd the War had con|tinued. Their Rea&s;on was this: In&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening the Prices of things which had been very dear for
<PB N="183" REF="342">
&s;ome time, by rea&s;on of the preceeding bad Sea|&s;ons, they &s;aw the Markets &s;till ri&s;ing; be&s;ides, that the Wrath of God was &s;een in the Barrenne&s;s of the Earth, we may attribute this Affliction to another Cau&s;e, occa&s;ion'd by the War. The King had been oblig'd to Re-coin the Money twice, that it might &s;erve in&s;tead of an Edict. Indeed he had got con|&s;iderably by this Project, for he rais'd the <HI>Louis-d'ors</HI> to 14 <HI>Livres,</HI> and the <HI>Silver Crowns</HI> to 3 <HI>Livres</HI> 12 <HI>Sous,</HI> though the one was not commonly worth above 11 <HI>Livres,</HI> and the other three&punc; Now the King for &s;ome Politick Con&s;iderations keeping up the Denomination of the Money, it came to pa&s;s, that what they us'd to have at ea&s;y Rates from Fo|reign Countries prov'd very dear, by rea&s;on of the lo&s;s of the Exchange, which was a full &s;ixth part.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> did not trouble his Head with the&s;e matters. He thought upon nothing, but either &s;eeing the effect of the Cardinal Primate's Promi&s;es, or returning to &s;ee his Mi&s;tre&s;s. His Eminence had retir'd to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cowits,</HI> where his Parti&s;ans a&s;&s;embled &s;everal times to no purpo&s;e. Many of 'em complained that Abbot <HI>Polignac</HI> had fed 'em with the hopes of things that were not like to be put in Execution. He had gone &s;o far, as to pro|mi&s;e that they &s;hould not want either the Money, or the Troops of <HI>France;</HI> for that being the only Affair that he minded, he wi&s;h'd that the King, in like manner, might have nothing el&s;e to mind. The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> finding that they began to complain of that Mini&s;ter, caus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d a Body of <HI>German</HI> Troops to enter the Country. This put tho&s;e, who were mo&s;t expos'd, into a Con&s;ternation; and &s;ome of 'em making &s;ome advances towards the making of their Peace with the Duke, the Prince no &s;ooner receiv'd the News, but he re&s;olv'd to return to <HI>France;</HI> but at the &s;ame time, to make the City of <HI>Dantzick</HI> repent of their giving his Rival the Prefe|rence,
<PB N="184" REF="343">
he order'd <HI>Bart</HI> to &s;eize &s;ome of their Ships that lay ju&s;t by him. They had anchor'd in the Road, with a de&s;ign to &s;ail up to the Port with their Car|goes; but <HI>Bart</HI> obliging them to follow him, car|ry'd 'em to <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> where the Prince was forc'd to put in by &s;tre&s;s of Weather. At the &s;ame time, the King &s;topp'd all the <HI>Dantzick</HI> Ships in his Har|bors, which makes it probable, that the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Orders to <HI>Bart,</HI> did not come &s;o much from him&s;elf as from the King. The Prince who had been very unea&s;y in his Voyage, was more &s;o when he came to <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> notwith&s;tanding that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> &s;hew'd a particular E&s;teem for his Per&s;on. He &s;et a part a great num|ber of Hou&s;es for the Prince and his Retinue, and the Wind continuing contrary for &s;ome Days, that little time &s;eem'd &s;o long to that Prince, that I doubt if the &s;ix Years, that according to the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torians, one of their Kings &s;pent in <HI>Ireland,</HI> before he could find a favourable minute to return to <HI>London:</HI> I doubt, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> Whether the&s;e &s;ix Years were longer to that King, than tho&s;e few Days were to the Prince? The occa&s;ion of his unea&s;i|ne&s;s was, that he was &s;till in Love, and that all the Comfort he had, was to wait for the Po&s;t|days, that he might hear from the Party he lov'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dantzickers</HI> made what Repri&s;als they could; they arre&s;ted the <HI>French</HI> Merchants at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and &s;eiz'd their Effects. But after all, they knew very well that 'twas not proper for them to Quarrel with a King, that the greate&s;t part of the Forces of <HI>Europe</HI> had in vain attempted to bring down; and upon that view they had recour&s;e to the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Mediation to procure the relea&s;ing of their Ships. The King made 'em &s;tay &s;ome time before he grant|ed their Reque&s;t; but at la&s;t, believing that the Mortification he had given 'em, was &s;ufficient to make 'em remember it, he accommodated the mat|ter

to their Satisfaction. Abbot <HI>Polignac</HI> was a&s;to|ni&s;h'd at the Prince's Return, and the Conduct of a great many, who after &s;iding with his Party, be|gan to De&s;ert him. At the &s;ame time notice was given to him from the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> that he ought to retire with Expedition out of the Country, or if he did not, that he could not an&s;wer for the Security of his Per&s;on. The Abbot did not think it his Duty to wait for a &s;econd Me&s;&s;age, but &s;et out <HI>incognito</HI> without any Retinue, and order'd his Equipage to make towards the Sea, in order to Im|barque there as well as him&s;elf; but they were robb'd before they could reach the Ships that &s;tay'd for 'em. The Abbot did not know, whether the Court which had given him no Orders for his Re|treat, would be pleas'd with it; and therefore he &s;tay'd &s;ome time at <HI>Hamburg</HI> to know the Orders of the Court. He wrote to the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Torcy,</HI> Se|cretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but receiv'd no An&s;wer; and having complain'd of this to his Friends in that Country, their An&s;wer was not ve|ry &s;atisfactory. They told him, That the Court was very Angry with him, and that the Cardinal Prima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e did not cea&s;e to do him di&s;&s;ervices. In earne&s;t, his Eminence wrote a great many things to <HI>France</HI> to his prejudice; he even in&s;inuated that he had applied to his own u&s;e part of the Money &s;ent him on the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s behalf. 'Tis believ'd that this Accu&s;ation was fal&s;e, and that 'twas only the Cardinal's chagrin upon &s;eeing him&s;elf aban|don'd that made him &s;peak in that fa&s;hion. 'Tis true, the Abbot was Poor, and that &s;ome time before he was reduc'd to &s;uch Straits that his Family would have wanted the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, if he had not found Friends to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. The Cardinal who knew his Straits, and likewi&s;e knew that &s;ome time after he had paid his Debts', probably grounded his Charge upon that Circum&s;tance. But let it be as it will; though a Man be never &s;o Innocent; 'tis a
<PB N="186" REF="345">
great Misfortune to lie under an Accu&s;ation. The Court &s;ent him Orders to retire to an Abby he had in <HI>Normandy;</HI> whether it was that they credited the Accu&s;ation, or, which is more likely, that they mean'd to make him an&s;werable for the event.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> having thus unhing'd his Competitor, thought he wanted nothing to com|pleat his good Fortune, but the Pope's Favour. As &s;oon as he was proclaim'd King, he had &s;ent an Envoy to &s;ollicite his Holine&s;s to favour his Intere&s;t. But as that Court moves but &s;lowly, e&s;pe|cially when there's any thing of Religion in the ca&s;e; &s;o his Holine&s;s would not grant Audience to the Envoy, till he was fully a&s;&s;ur'd that that Duke had abjur'd <HI>Lutherani&s;m.</HI> A Certificate of the Abjuration was brought to him, but he &s;u&s;pected it mightily. It came only from the Hands of a Bi&s;hop of his Family, who might be &s;u&s;pected to be gain'd by that Prince, becau&s;e their common Grandeur was concern'd upon that occa&s;ion. The Duke having never entertain'd any Corre&s;pondence with that Court, was not throughly vers'd in their Politicks, and was &s;o far from &s;eeing through the true Spring of his Holine&s;s's Motions, that he ima|gin'd the Pope to be in the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Inte|re&s;t. Accordingly, as &s;oon as the Prince return'd to <HI>France,</HI> he &s;ent a &s;econd Envoy to the Pope to re|pre&s;ent to his Holine&s;s, that he needed not to con|tinue any longer in the Intere&s;t of a Prince, who by his Retreat had given &s;ufficient evidence, that he had drop'd his Preten&s;ions to the Crown. In the mean time, the Pope was far from being bia&s;s'd that way. Had he been oblig'd to &s;ide with one or t'other; he had not &s;crupl'd to fall in with the Duke. He was an <HI>Italian, i. e.</HI> no great Friend to <HI>French-men;</HI> be&s;ides, he was by Birth, a Subject of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which Quality did not allow him to depart from the Sentiments of the Hou&s;e of
<PB N="187" REF="346">
<HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> However, being Head of the Catholick Church, and upon that &s;core oblig'd to ob&s;erve Mea&s;ures on all hands, he &s;ent Orders to his Nuncio at <HI>Cologn</HI> to go for that Country. He or|der'd him, under the pretence of promoting the Intere&s;t of Religion, to reconcile the Cardinal Pri|mate and the Duke. The Cardinal &s;hew'd all along a violent Re&s;olution to rai&s;e a Civil War, rather than be without Satisfaction for the Affront offer'd him by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cujavia,</HI> by Crowning the Duke. He alledg'd, and ju&s;tly indeed, That the right of Coronation was lodg'd in the Church of <HI>Gne&s;ne,</HI> of which he was Archbi&s;hop. The Pope had another Nuncio already upon the &s;pot, who of his own head did not fail to anticipate the Orders given to this. For he knew very well that whatever he did for the Intere&s;t of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> would be approv'd by his Holine&s;s; and accordingly had privately embarqu'd in the Duke's Party.</P>
<P>Some time being &s;pent in all the&s;e Tran&s;actions, the Year came to an end, which was the time al|loted by his Maje&s;ty for the Conclu&s;ion of the Mar|riage of the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> to the Prince&s;s of <HI>Savoy.</HI> Every day he lik'd the Propo&s;al better and better; and the young Prince&s;s had &s;uch a winning way, that he lov'd her as tenderly, as if &s;he had been his own Daughter. The Duke was but weak for one of his Age, in&s;omuch, that though the Ce|remony was to be perform'd out of hand, yet he was not to enjoy her till he pa&s;s'd 18 Years, and &s;he 14. In former times, when the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Louvois</HI> marry'd his elde&s;t Daughter to the Duke of <HI>Rocheguyon,</HI> the Son of the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut,</HI> the Con&s;ummation of the Marriage was not put &s;o long off; but the Relations on both &s;ides made a mutual Compact, that the new-married Couple &s;hould not &s;ee one another but once a Week, namely on <HI>Thur&s;days,</HI> and that they &s;hould live in Celibacy
<PB N="188" REF="347">
without any mutual Commerce for the re&s;t of the Week. This made 'em always long for the arrival of the appointed Day of meeting, and in&s;pir'd 'em with a mutual Eagerne&s;s: And if all marry'd Per|&s;ons were confin'd to the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">me mea&s;ures, perhaps they would not be &s;o &s;oon weary of one another, as we commonly find 'em. However, the King having regulated the matter as above, Preparations were made for celebrating the Marriage, which were expen&s;ive to an unparallel'd degree. Nay, his Maje&s;ty intimated that he would take it well if every body would act up to his Abi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ity in honour|ing the Fe&s;tival. 'Twas not the literal performance of this de&s;ire, that would have &s;atisfied his Maje&s;ty; if that had only been requir'd, the Nuptial Cere|monies would have been a very mean thing, for the charge of the War, and of the Taxes, that &s;till continued during its whole cour&s;e, had &s;o impove|ri&s;h'd the Subjects, that they could &s;carce be poorer than they were. So that all the Courtiers, and even the Military Officers that happen'd to be then at Court, put another Con&s;truction upon the matter. They knew where the Kings meaning lay; and all of 'em being ready to do any thing to plea&s;e his Maje&s;ty, &s;traiten'd them&s;elves to obtain that end. The charge they were at was altogether extraordi|nary; nay, &s;ome of 'em bought Cloaths that were worth more Money than the intrin&s;ick Value of their E&s;tates. I do not &s;peak by way of Amplifica|cation, but deliver a naked Truth; witne&s;s a great many Land and Sea-Officers, who laid out 5 or 600 Crowns for one Suit of Cloaths, though at the &s;ame time a great part of 'em were not worth 10 Crowrs a Year of Patrimonial E&s;tate. Herein lies the Folly of the <HI>French;</HI> and though I am a <HI>French|man</HI> my &s;elf, and perhaps as great a Fool as others, yet I cannot ab&s;tain from cen&s;uring our common Folly.</P>

After the Conclu&s;ion of the Peace, there was &s;o great a Confluence of Foreigners at <HI>Paris,</HI> that in the <HI>Suburbs</HI> of S <HI>Germains</HI> only, there was about 15 or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">6000.

They &s;aw that great Town did not only abound in People, as much as ever, but that Luxury and Plea&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e were arriv'd to &s;uch a degree in it, that the meane&s;t Citizen was more &s;plendid than the Per|&s;ons o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Quality in their Country.

Years time, the number of Coaches was increas'd to above 2000. Gold and Azure were to be &s;een in every Family, which extreamly &s;urpris'd the&s;e Strangers, who, before their Arrival, had heard that all <HI>Paris</HI> could not afford either Silver-Spoon or Fork, and that the King had pillag'd them of all, to &s;upport the Expences of the War. It's cer|tain, that the War had impoveri&s;h'd a great many, but &s;uch were to be &s;een rather in the Country, than in <HI>Paris.</HI> On the contrary, <HI>Paris</HI> had never been either &s;o Rich, or &s;o Magnificent, there being 160000000 Millions expended in it, only by the Par|ties that were form'd there &s;ince the War, without rec|koning what others might have gain'd by a thou&s;and different ways. For while &s;ome got infinitely by the Parti&s;ans, in lending them Money upon extrava|gant Intere&s;t; others applied them&s;elves to the way of Victualling, or to &s;ome other thing, &s;o that it might be ju&s;tly alledg'd, as War had ruin'd &s;ome, it had rais'd others &s;o prodigiou&s;ly, that they were no more to be known for the &s;ame Per&s;ons: So different were they now, from what they had been formerly. There was &s;uch an infinite number of Sharpers, and &s;uch like Scoundrels, who had rais'd them&s;elves from the very <HI>Scum</HI> of the People, to va&s;t Riches, by &s;ucking the Blood of the poor People.

<HI>Paris</HI> &s;o different from the Relation they had of 'em at home, they were much more a&s;toni&s;h'd to &s;ee the Solemnity of the Marriage of the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> and the Prince&s;s at <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI> The Cere|mony was perform'd with all the Splendor imagin|able; they gave a great many <HI>Balls,</HI> where all the Per&s;ons of Quality, retaining to the Court, of both Sexes, were pre&s;ent. All the Ladies were cloath'd in Black Velvet, &s;et out with precious Stones, that ca&s;t the brighte&s;t Lu&s;tre imaginable: The Men were al&s;o adorn'd with Diamonds. As on &s;uch Occa&s;ions the Pick-pockets of <HI>Paris</HI> are very intentive upon their Bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o they came in whole Swarms to keep Holy-day at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> adorn'd as others were, and, abating for their Countenances, that are hardly well known in that place, one would have thought they were all Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t Rank. The extraordi|nary Crowd, as one may ea&s;ily imagine, afforded them &s;ufficient opportunity to make up, with con&s;i|derable advantage, the Expence of their Ornaments. A great many, after their return home, found at their lea&s;ure that the Diamonds they had carried to the Solemnity were gone. The Rogues had ta|ken from &s;ome <HI>one,</HI> from others <HI>two,</HI> and &s;o more or le&s;s; and they might repute them&s;elves happy, who came off free. Even the Duche&s;s of <HI>Burgundy</HI> did not e&s;cape the common Fate of tho&s;e, who had &s;uffer'd by the&s;e Pick-pockets. They ventur'd to cut away a part of her Gown, where &s;he had a large Buckle of Diamonds. But, what is &s;urprizing, the <HI>Chevalier</HI> of <HI>Sully</HI> had the &s;ame fate, and what he lo&s;t, was by the hand of a Per&s;on of the fir&s;t Quality: He catch'd him in the fact, and took the liberty to tell it to one of his Friends. His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> over-heard it, and de&s;ir'd to be further inform'd of the matter, but was extreamly a&s;toni&s;h'd, when they whi&s;per'd to him the Name of this young Pick-pocket; he forbid to Challenge him upon it, being willing to &s;ave his Honour, for the Re&s;pect

<P>Upon the Marriage-day, the new married Couple were put to Bed; but the Curtains being undrawn, there were a great many Witne&s;&s;es of their Actions, only in order to &s;ee if they lay clo&s;e to one another.

That young Prince&s;s kept A&s;&s;emblies the &s;ame day, and the following days. Her Court was very throng, and the Ladies &s;trove who &s;hould &s;hew her mo&s;t Re&s;pect. There happen'd a difference betwixt the Prince&s;s of <HI>Har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ourt,</HI> and the young Duche&s;s of <HI>Sully,</HI> Daughter to the Duke of <HI>Coai&s;lin:</HI> She was Niece to the Duche&s;s's <HI>Lude,</HI> Lady of Honour to the Prince&s;s. This Relation came by her Husband, who was the Duche&s;s, or Brother's Son; &s;he want|ed her A&s;&s;i&s;tance in regard of her Youth, not being in Condition to enter the Li&s;ts with a Prince&s;s, who&s;e only bu&s;ine&s;s had been (&s;ince &s;he was in the World) to ingratiate her &s;elf with all in Power, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t Mini&s;ter. But in|&s;tead of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he expected from her, the Aunt advis'd her to yield to her Adver&s;ary. All the Duche&s;&s;es were highly incen&s;ed again&s;t the Duche&s;s of <HI>Lude;</HI> finding &s;he had tarni&s;h'd their Honour by &s;o &s;candalous an Advice. In effect, though &s;uch &s;ort of Di&s;putes had often fallen out, not only betwixt the Prince&s;&s;es and the Duche&s;&s;es, but even betwixt their Husbands; yet, perhaps &s;uch another as this had never fallen out before. The Dukes and Duche&s;&s;es had always maintain'd their Rank, as if St. <HI>Louis</HI> had begot them. The late Duke of <HI>Mon|tauzier,</HI> and the late Duche&s;s of <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">lles,</HI> &s;tretch'd the Affair yet further; the one again&s;t Mon&s;ieur <HI>Le</HI>

<HI>Grand,</HI> a Prince of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the other again&s;t the Duche&s;s of <HI>Bouillon.</HI> Though the Duche&s;s of <HI>Noailles,</HI> was only the Daughter of a <HI>Farmer</HI> of the Revenues; yet &s;he was &s;en&s;ible that in <HI>France, Nobility</HI> came not by the <HI>Wives,</HI> but by the <HI>Husbands;</HI> &s;he &s;helter'd her &s;elf from any Indig|nity by the Character of her Husband, whom &s;he took to be beyond Reproach. However it ordina|rily falls out in a Difference betwixt two Parties, that they upbraid one another, even to the five hundreth Generation. The Duche&s;s of <HI>Bouillon</HI> produc'd Re|cords, by which &s;he made it appear, that <HI>Anthony</HI> of <HI>Noailles</HI> had been formerly Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;hold to one of her Husband's Ance&s;tors. In fine, this Affair enrag'd the Parties to that degree, that they call'd one another all the <HI>Ill Names</HI> they could think on. His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> was at la&s;t oblig'd to impo&s;e Si|lence by his Authority; he forbad them expre&s;ly to proceed farther, without deciding any thing in the matter, that caus'd their heats.

<P>Though the Peace had been made a pretty while, yet none hitherto reap'd the Fruits of it. The Commerce was as dead as in the time of War; whether it was attributed to the high value of the <HI>French</HI> Coin, that continued &s;till at the &s;ame Rate, or that the King believ'd he could &s;ub&s;i&s;t without other Nations, while others mu&s;t have recour&s;e to him, there was yet no advance made to make it flouri&s;h. In the mean time, there came &s;ome Ships from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> to take in Wine and Pa|per at <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> and <HI>Rouen.</HI> They bought along
<PB N="194" REF="353">
other Merchandize to be &s;old there. But the <HI>Tariff</HI> not being yet regulated between all the Parties, and the Treaty of <HI>Ry&s;wick</HI> having only mention'd, that it &s;hould be put upon the &s;ame foot as it was in the Years 1665 and 1666, which was not yet done; this together with the lo&s;s of twenty in the hundred by the Money, oblig'd the&s;e Ships to return with|out either &s;elling or buying any thing in the&s;e Ports. About the &s;ame time, the <HI>States-General</HI> &s;ent <HI>Deputies</HI> to the King, to demand the Execution of that Article. They apply'd them&s;elves to the Mar|qui&s;s of <HI>Torcy,</HI> Secretary for Foreign Affairs, but Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ponchartrain</HI> having the Charge of that Commerce, they were remitted to him for the Ex|ecution of their Demands. The&s;e <HI>Deputies</HI> were ex|ceedingly well vers'd in Affairs of that nature, and the States having an intire Confidence in them, had given them a <HI>Full Power</HI> to Act as Commi&s;&s;aries in the Regulation of the <HI>Tariff.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pontchar|train</HI> heard them upon the Matter, but being Judi|cious and Politick, he put them off with fair Words, until he had acquainted the King with the Affair. The Commerce of <HI>Holland</HI> was of far le&s;s advantage to <HI>France,</HI> than <HI>that</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e they draw a great deal more Money from the one than from the other. In effect, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Import more Merchandize into <HI>France</HI> than they Export; whereas <HI>England</HI> on the contrary Exports more than they Import. So that the fir&s;t carries out the Coin, and the other brings it <HI>in.</HI> This made them re&s;olve to keep up the <HI>Tariff</HI> as high as po&s;&s;i|ble, in regard of the <HI>Holland</HI>-Trade, its Impo&s;ts or Cu&s;toms, while they de&s;ign'd to lower it in re|gard of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> while they expected the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> &s;hould come to <HI>Paris</HI> to terminate that Affair, they re&s;olv'd to &s;end to <HI>London</HI> to regulate what re|garded that Nation. <HI>Ponchartrain</HI> pitch'd upon Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Phelipe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ux D'Herbeaut,</HI> his Relation, for that purpo&s;e; he was fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ary of the Marine,

under Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Maurepas,</HI> who had left him the whole Managment of it. He had the Character of <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary-General</HI> for regulating the Commerce betwixt the two Nations; but though his Commi&s;|&s;ion was pre&s;ently di&s;patch'd, yet he &s;tay'd a long time after. In the mean time, the Court nam'd other Commi&s;&s;aries to treat with the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> but as they had no de&s;ign to terminate the Affair to their Satisfaction, &s;o it continues to this day at the &s;ame pa&s;s.</P>
<P>While the&s;e matters were a tran&s;acting, the King nam'd <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors</HI> to go to all the <HI>Foreign Courts;</HI> and in&s;tead of &s;ending Gentlemen of the <HI>Law,</HI> as had been always practic'd in <HI>France,</HI> he employ'd Per&s;ons of Quality, or Officers of the Army. He thought, if they could joyn the Knowledge of the Cabinet to the Experience they had acquir'd in war|like Affairs, they would be more accompli&s;h'd for his Service upon all occa&s;ions. He cho&s;e the Mar|qui&s;s of <HI>Villars,</HI> Lieutenant-General of the Army, for the Court of <HI>Vienna;</HI> and the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Har|court,</HI> al&s;o a Lieutenant-General, for his <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> who during the War, had acquir'd a Repu|tation equal to any; and could he perform the &s;ame thing in his Emba&s;&s;y, which he had done at the Head of a Flying Army, no more could be expect|ed of him; but that being a hard Task, his Friends could hardly hope for it. He was going to a Court, where the very name of <HI>French</HI> is &s;u&s;pected, much more at a time, when he &s;eem'd very earne&s;t to create all the Ob&s;tacles imaginable to the Emperor's De&s;igns of bringing the Succe&s;&s;ion of his Catholick Maje&s;ty to fall upon the King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> his elde&s;t Son, or that failing, upon the <HI>Arch-Duke,</HI> his &s;econd Son. <HI>Philip</HI> IV. his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's Father, had left it by <HI>Te&s;tament,</HI> to the la&s;t, tho' he was not Born at that time; but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;hew|ing no Inclination to execute it, his <HI>Imperi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l Maje&s;ty</HI> labour'd to engage them to favour the King of the

<HI>Romans.</HI> He thought, that being his elde&s;t Son, he not only de&s;erv'd better that Dignity, which was much more &s;olid than that of Emperor, though not altogether &s;o &s;plendid; but he expected al&s;o to &s;ecure the Fortune of his Son the better, if he could unite the&s;e two Qualities in one Per&s;on. The Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> being his Si&s;ter-in-law, he did not doubt of her favouring his De&s;ign; and the Count of <HI>Harrach,</HI> his <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador</HI> at that Court, had a Commi&s;&s;ion to propo&s;e it to her. The <HI>Queen</HI> join'd I&s;&s;ue with the Amba&s;&s;ador in all his Sentiments; and his Imperial Maje&s;ty being hitherto &s;o pro&s;perous in his De&s;igns, as to get the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Creatures into his Catholick <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Council, and &s;he being very indu&s;trious to gain the other Members, they met often to con&s;i|der how to behave in the Scene they were to Act. The Count of <HI>Harrach</HI> in&s;inuated to the Queen and them, that the be&s;t Method they could fall upon in this Juncture, was, to put the Government of the Frontiers into <HI>German-</HI>hands, or into the Hands of Per&s;ons well-affected to the Emperor. The Prince of <HI>Darm&s;tadt,</HI> who &s;ignaliz'd him&s;elf in the Defence of <HI>Barcelona,</HI> was propos'd to be Vice-Roy of <HI>Cata|lonia; Don Franci&s;co de Vela&s;co,</HI> having rendred him&s;elf unworthy of that Command, by &s;uffering him&s;elf to be &s;urpriz'd in his Camp. The Government of <HI>Milan</HI> &s;eem'd too good to e&s;cape one of his <HI>Imperial Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Creatures, as did al&s;o the Vice-Royalty of <HI>Navarre;</HI> for the Count of <HI>Harrach</HI> &s;uppos'd very rea&s;onably that it was by attacking of one of the&s;e three places, if not all the three at once, that the King of <HI>France</HI> meant to make good his Preten|&s;ions to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, immediately after the Death of that Monarch. The <HI>Queen,</HI> and tho&s;e of the King's Council, who were in her Intere&s;t, found it difficult to manage that point; for though the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were too wi&s;e to own their Sentiments openly, yet they had not the lea&s;t Inclination to own either the Emperor's elde&s;t or younge&s;t Son,
<PB N="197" REF="356">
for their Soveraign. They were al&s;o of the &s;ame Opinion in regard of the <HI>Dauphin</HI> and his Sons; though &s;ome of the <HI>French</HI> Emi&s;&s;aries endeavour'd to in&s;inuate to them &s;ecretly, that if they would chu&s;e either the Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> or the Duke of <HI>Berry,</HI> they could form their tender Years according to their own Model, in&s;omuch that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to perceive they had ever been born <HI>French-men.</HI> And by the&s;e means they labour'd to extirpate the Antipathy, that was natural to the two Nations; but that being a hard Point to ma|nage, they always rejected it with &s;corn. They could never conceive why they would deprive the Prince of <HI>Bavaria</HI> of that Succe&s;&s;ion, for it was naturally his <HI>Right,</HI> after the Renunciation his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> had made of it, when he married the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> Others wi&s;h'd, &s;ince the King had no Heirs begot of his own Body, the Crown might fall to &s;ome <HI>Grandee</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> They be|liev'd they &s;hould be more happy under &s;uch a Per&s;on, than under any <HI>Foreign Prince.</HI> For &s;uch a one being train'd up from his Cradle in their <HI>Cu|&s;toms</HI> and <HI>Manners,</HI> they could bear more ea&s;ily with him than with any other. For, generally, all Men inherit the <HI>Genius</HI> of the Country, where they are Born, and it is hard for them ever to change their natural Inclination.</P>
<P>Such was the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Affairs of that Nation, when the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> made u&s;e of all her Intere&s;t to have the Prince of <HI>Darm&s;tadt</HI> made Vice-Roy of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> Prince <HI>Vaudemont</HI> Governor of <HI>Milan,</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy</HI> Vice-Roy of <HI>Navarre.</HI> For &s;he not only look'd upon them as well-affected to the Emperor, but al&s;o very capable to defend again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> the Places committed to their care. They had di&s;tingui&s;h'd them&s;elves upon a thou&s;and occa&s;ions; and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> was actually employ'd again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> with whom the Emperor was in continual War. That Barba|rous
<PB N="198" REF="357">
Nation ow'd its Pre&s;ervation only to the Di|ver&s;ion, was made upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> when his <HI>Impe|rial Maje&s;ty</HI> was engag'd again&s;t <HI>France.</HI> But now the Peace being concluded betwixt the&s;e two Po|tentates, the Emperor thought of no le&s;s than &s;wal|lowing up the <HI>Turks</HI> in a Campaign or two at mo&s;t, and di&s;lodging 'em of all their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in <HI>Europe.</HI> But whether that Prince meant to take his ea&s;e after &s;o tedious a War, or, what is more likely, that true Policy oblig'd him to de&s;ire a Peace, there were already &s;ome Propo&s;als made, that had a favourable hearing from both Parties, and per|haps without that Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> who about this time &s;aw him&s;elf at the Head of the Emperor's Army, would hardly accept of the <HI>Office</HI> of Vice-Roy of <HI>Navarre.</HI> But now finding him&s;elf oblig'd to put up the Sword, he was glad, that by the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Influence, the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> had that <HI>Deference</HI> for him. However, her &s;ucce&s;s in that was not &s;o fa|vourable as it was on the behalf of the Princes of <HI>Darm&s;tadt</HI> and <HI>Vaud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mont.</HI> For the Services of the fir&s;t at <HI>Barcelona</HI> pleading highly in his Favour, &s;he carried it for him without any Oppo&s;ition; but &s;he met with more difficulty in regard of the Go|vernment of <HI>Milan.</HI> Some would have it continued to the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Leganez,</HI> who was there alrea|dy, or conferr'd upon &s;ome <HI>Grandee</HI> of <HI>Spain;</HI> but that was far from the <HI>Queen</HI>'s mind; &s;he meant rather to &s;trip them of what they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd than provide them with new Governments. The Duke of <HI>Medina Celi,</HI> one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Gran|dees of <HI>Spain,</HI> and mo&s;t belov'd of the People, was Vice-Roy of <HI>Naples.</HI> He had pa&s;s'd &s;ome years in that Employ, and places of that nature are u&s;ually triennial in <HI>Spain;</HI> yet &s;he would gladly have it conferr'd upon one of her Creatures, but her Friends thought it not convenient, and rather ad|vis'd her to the contrary to continue it to him; and gave for their rea&s;on, that &s;he ought to be very

cautious in bringing him to <HI>Spain</HI> in the pre&s;ent Po|&s;ture of Affairs; which would not fail to awake the People's Affection for him, and con&s;equent|ly to make &s;ome Ob&s;tacles to the Emperor's De|&s;igns.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;ons which oblig'd the <HI>Emperor</HI> to &s;trike up a Peace with the <HI>Port,</HI> were the&s;e. His Power became formidable, not only to the Princes of the Empire, but even to his other Allies. Be&s;ides, knowing his Preten&s;ions to the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Spain,</HI> they not only oppos'd it privately, but even avow|edly. The Princes who granted him Succors again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;poke of withdrawing them. The New King of <HI>England,</HI> before he was own'd by <HI>France,</HI> offer'd his Mediation for agreeing the Parties. He had &s;ent two <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors</HI> to the <HI>Port</HI> on purpo&s;e, to propo&s;e it to the <HI>Grand Seignior;</HI> but they both died upon their way thither. This appearing very extraordinary, becau&s;e the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Intere&s;t &s;eem'd altogether oppo&s;ite to his Conduct; and, be&s;ides the Death of the&s;e two Per&s;ons affording matter of Speculation upon a great many things, &s;ome be|liev'd a&s;&s;uredly they had been poy&s;on'd. This might have di&s;courag'd his <HI>Britannick Maje&s;ty</HI> from &s;ending any more Amba&s;&s;adors into that Country; but con&s;idering that the <HI>Turks</HI> their rejecting of the Peace, was only grounded upon the Diver&s;ion was made in their favour, and that po&s;&s;ibly they would lay a&s;ide their Ob&s;tinacy, when convinc'd of their Error, he a&s;&s;um'd his fir&s;t Re&s;olution, nor was he in the lea&s;t deceiv'd; for the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> accepted of his offer now with as much warmth, as he had rejected it before with indifference. He accepted of <HI>his Mediation,</HI> and the <HI>States-General</HI>'s, which was offer'd to him at the &s;ame time. And being &s;atis|fied that in the Peace they had made with <HI>France,</HI> they had ea&s;ily &s;urmounted all the Difficulties that commonly attend the Preliminaries of <HI>Treaties,</HI> they mean'd to follow the &s;ame Method in <HI>this.</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="359">
The Emperor under&s;tanding, that the <HI>Turks</HI> had accepted of the Mediation that was offer'd 'em, gave notice of it to the <HI>Potentates,</HI> who were in|tere&s;ted with him in the War; namely, the <HI>Repub|licks</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Great Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> They were mutually ingag'd in an <HI>Offen|&s;ive</HI> and <HI>Defen&s;ive</HI> League; &s;o he being re&s;olv'd to do nothing without their Con&s;ent, de&s;ir'd them to give in their Preten&s;ions in <HI>Writing,</HI> while the Parties &s;hould have conde&s;cended upon the place of a&s;&s;embling.

<P>While the New King triumph'd after this manner, either upon the account of the advantageous Peace he gave to <HI>Europe,</HI> or the great Confidence his Al|lies had in him, or the Con&s;ideration they had for him, in&s;omuch that nothing could be enterpriz'd without his Approbation; the Pope's Nuncio, whom he had &s;ent into <HI>Poland,</HI> after he had conferr'd with the <HI>Ordinary Nuncio</HI> at that Court, and been in|form'd by him of the State of Affairs in that Coun|try, &s;ignify'd to his <HI>Poli&s;h Maje&s;ty,</HI> that his <HI>Holi|ne&s;s</HI> was not &s;o aver&s;e to his Election, as he &s;up|po&s;ed; that the main thing in que&s;tion was, whether his Conver&s;ion had been &s;incere; and provided that Point was clear'd, the <HI>Holy Father</HI> would be fully &s;atisfied.

However, he de&s;ir'd to be excus'd from &s;igning any thing touching the Pri|vileges he would have him to renounce, until he were better inform'd in what they con&s;i&s;ted, and had the Advice of the Republick, without who&s;e Approbation he could not hand&s;omely conclude any matter of that importance.

And even from that Subject took occa&s;ion to exclaim highly again&s;t him, as if he had entred the Nation by force, and mean'd to &s;ecure it by Conque&s;t, ra|ther than by lawful means.</P>
<P>After the Conclu&s;ion of this Treaty, the Cardi|nal Primate went from <HI>Lowits</HI> to pay his Homage to the King at <HI>War&s;aw.</HI> His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> &s;ent the prin|cipal Gentlemen of his Court to meet him, and ho|nour his <HI>Entry,</HI> which had much more the <HI>Air</HI> of a <HI>Triumph,</HI> than what was due to the merit of a <HI>Cri|minal.</HI> He was accompanied into the Palace by a great many Per&s;ons of Quality, who were over|joy'd to &s;ee this Reconciliation. The King and he had a private Interview for half an hour. It was generally believ'd, that the Troubles of the Kingdom were now at an end; and in effect, the Queen of <HI>Poland</HI> having lo&s;t all hopes of &s;eeing her Son upon the <HI>Throne,</HI> which till that time &s;he never de&s;pair'd of, ask'd his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Leave to pa&s;s &s;ome time at <HI>Rome.</HI> The King refus'd it before he advis'd with his Council, which was compos'd of the principal Senators of the <HI>Nation.</HI> However, they &s;aw no in|conveniency in granting it, and gave her to know that &s;he &s;hould not be hindred to depart when &s;he thought fit. Accordingly &s;he put her &s;elf in a readi|ne&s;s to be gone again&s;t the latter end of the Year.

where it was impo&s;&s;ible for his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje|&s;ty to &s;ee her without Indignation; yet it was generally believ'd &s;he would chu&s;e <HI>France</HI> for her Retreat, it being natural for People to love the place of their Nativity. For it was openly report|ed, That &s;he was treating with the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and her Son, the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> for the Duchy of <HI>Aubigny</HI> in <HI>Berry,</HI> which the late King <HI>Charles</HI> II. bought for that Duche&s;s upon cer|tain Conditions, not very acceptable to her. But the King being &s;en&s;ible, that if he did not tie her up to &s;uch Terms, a Woman of her Temper might be reduc'd to end her Days in an Ho&s;pital, was therefore glad to do her this kindne&s;s again&s;t her Inclination. He had already a Mi&s;tris of the &s;ame Temper, namely, the Duche&s;s of <HI>Cleaveland,</HI> who had lavi&s;h'd away all that the King had given her. However, he be&s;tow'd large Sums upon the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> and &s;uch was his Liberality, that he had laid out above a Million of Money for <HI>China</HI> to her. But though there be nothing harder than the Sub&s;tance 'tis made of, &s;he found out a way to melt it all at <HI>Paris,</HI> without &s;uffering any other inconvenience by it, than what ordinarily attends <HI>Mi&s;ery.</HI></P>
<P>However, it was not altogether impo&s;&s;ible to ac|commodate the Difference betwixt the Queen of <HI>Poland,</HI> and his <HI>Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty,</HI> if her <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">li&s;h Maje&s;ty</HI> would conde&s;cend in &s;ome mea&s;ure to imitate the Count of <HI>Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lk</HI> mention'd before She might have own'd her &s;elf in the wrong, and &s;up|plicated his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> for the Honour of his Prote|ction; but &s;he was too haughty to conde&s;cend to it, in&s;omuch, that &s;he was now wholly intent upon leaving &s;peedily a place where her Circum&s;tances had &s;uffer'd &s;o &s;en&s;ible an Alteration. For during her Husband's life-time, every one was glad to truckle to her, in regard of the A&s;cendant, they knew, &s;he had over him. Now the Scene was
<PB N="207" REF="366">
chang'd, and &s;o different from the former, that every one was ready to impute to her, what was blam'd in her Husband, as if &s;he had been the only Per&s;on who prompted him.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Poland</HI> being thus own'd by the <HI>Pope,</HI> and wanting only now to be recogniz'd by his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, in order to enjoy peaceably the Dignity of a Crown that had been &s;o much di&s;pu|ted, &s;ent a Per&s;on of Quality to <HI>France,</HI> to excu&s;e the Robbery committed upon the Abbot of <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lignac</HI>'s Equipage, and to e&s;tabli&s;h a good Corre&s;pondence with his <HI>Maje&s;ty;</HI> for, though in appearance he had no need of him, e&s;pecially, being &s;o &s;trictly join'd in Alliance with the Emperor, and all the Princes his Neighbours; yet, con&s;idering that Kings have long Arms, e&s;pecially the King who governs <HI>France</HI> at this time, he would omit nothing that was due to Policy. The King receiv'd his <HI>Envoy</HI> with all the marks of Re&s;pect he could wi&s;h for, and all Parties forgeting the occa&s;ion of their Differences, a good Intelligence and Union was e&s;tabli&s;h'd be|twixt the two Nations, though hardly to that degree it had been formerly. In the mean time, the King return'd to the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> the Money he had expended in the pur&s;ute of that Crown, which in all probability pleas'd him much more, than if he had obtain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d <HI>it.</HI> Not that he is Covetous in any degree, but continuing &s;till Amorous, the &s;atisfa|ction he enjoy'd in &s;eeing his <HI>Mi&s;tri&s;s,</HI> rendred him in&s;en&s;ible of all other plea&s;ures. Be&s;ides, he was &s;oon comforted for the lo&s;s of that Dignity, by the liberal &s;hare he had with the Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI> in the <HI>Dauphin</HI>'s Favour, and the hopes he had of gaining his Proce&s;s before the Court of Parliament, as he had done formerly.</P>
<P>However, there happen'd an Accident to the Duke, that was like to deprive him both of that Advantage and his Life. In his return from <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t,</HI> a Hou&s;e which King <HI>Henry</HI> IV. had given to the
<PB N="208" REF="367">
Lady <HI>Jane Gabriell,</HI> of whom he was de&s;cended: He was like to be drown'd in a Po&s;t-Chai&s;e, for he was up to his Chin in a little River, which he was oblig'd to pa&s;s, and it being the middle of Winter, the Cold which he &s;uffer'd, was capable to do him all the mi&s;chief that could be expected from &s;o cruel an Accident. But as he is a Noble Prince, who delights to do good, and has no Enemies; and be|&s;ides, had acquir'd a great deal of Glory before <HI>Barcelona;</HI> &s;o every one was overjoy'd to &s;ee their Fears end more happily than they expected. It on|ly co&s;t him a <HI>fright;</HI> however, this General, who by his Conque&s;t, had gain'd the Reputation of the greate&s;t <HI>Hero,</HI> being &s;ubject to a great many Infir|mities, as well as the <HI>Ancient Hero</HI>'s, found him&s;elf &s;o bad, that he was oblig'd to apply him&s;elf to Phy&s;icians. He had contracted a Di&s;ea&s;e that gave him more trouble, than the taking of four <HI>Barcelona</HI>'s. And his trouble was &s;o much the greater, that his Malady was of an old &s;tanding, and created him every moment in&s;ufferable Pains; he enjoy'd no manner of re&s;t, and it was to be fear'd; that if he neglected it any longer, it might be pa&s;s'd all cure. He re&s;olv'd to put him&s;elf into the hands of a Chy|mi&s;t Phy&s;ician, nam'd <HI>Chambon.</HI> This Gentleman was nothing different from tho&s;e of his Kidney, that is to &s;ay, neither better nor wor&s;e than a Quack, who boa&s;t as highly, as if they were many degrees above <HI>Ae&s;culapius;</HI> but if he cured four Per&s;ons, he certainly kill'd a whole Dozen, and the Cures he had perform'd, were rather the Pro|duct of <HI>Chance</HI> than of <HI>Skill.</HI> He was much at one with Dr. <HI>Carette,</HI> who had but one Remedy for all manner of Di&s;ea&s;es, and yet would have Mankind believe that he was the able&s;t <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> in the Uni|ver&s;e. Be it as it will, this new Phy&s;ician &s;et him|&s;elf up in form, becau&s;e he had cured &s;ome few Per&s;ons in the World, and among&s;t others, a cer|tain Abbot of <HI>Chaulieu,</HI> who was a &s;ort of Inten|dant
<PB N="209" REF="368">
of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Vendome.</HI> This Abbot was very de&s;irous that the Duke would make u&s;e of <HI>Chambon</HI> to cure him. However, the Duke withdrew in a &s;hort while, and had no great rea&s;on to brag of his Phy&s;ician's Remedies. For <HI>Chambon</HI> did nothing, and at this time, the Duke finds him&s;elf in little bet|ter Circum&s;tances, than when he fir&s;t made u&s;e of him. It may be rather &s;aid, That he is &s;till wor&s;e, for the more inveterate the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es are, they are the more difficult to be cur'd. Yet &s;ome will have it, that his Grand-father found the means to be cur'd after Forty Years; but that was &s;carce done by the Skill of a Chymi&s;t, and its probable, that if his Grand-&s;on had copied him, he had apply'd him|&s;elf to &s;ome other Per&s;on, than his Intendant's Fa|vourite.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> had no rea&s;on to complain of his Daughter's Marriage; but knowing that the King had no mind to have it con&s;ummated, he in|treated his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> to con&s;ummate it, to the end his Daughter's Condition might be more &s;ecure. He was afraid that the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> might come to die by &s;ome mi&s;chance, and &s;o his Daughter be return'd upon his hand. But that was far from his Maje&s;ty's Inclination; on the contrary it was well known, if that had happen'd, he would have mar|ried her to the Duke of <HI>Anjou;</HI> and in view of that only, he hindred all Commerce betwixt them, to the end, that a Di&s;pen&s;ation might be the more ea&s;ily obtain'd. I can't tell, whether the King made his De&s;ign known to him; but it is certain, that after the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Ferrette</HI> had &s;poke to him by his Maje&s;ty's Command, the Duke was not only out of all hopes, but &s;hew'd no Inclination to it. However, if he could not obtain that Demand, he &s;ucceeded (in a &s;hort time after) much better in another he made to his <HI>Maje&s;ty.</HI> He intreated him to Bani&s;h Madamo&s;elle <HI>de Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> (who&s;e Conduct was offen&s;ive to him) out of his Kingdom. He al&s;o
<PB N="210" REF="369">
de&s;ir'd of him to cau&s;e &s;hut up Madamoi&s;elle <HI>de Ca|rignan</HI> in a Convent. The la&s;t &s;hew'd a great deal of Complai&s;ance to a married Man, who lived after a very indifferent manner with his own Wife; whether it was that he had inherited that of his Fa|ther, who had never been a good Husband, or that the Affection he had for this Prince&s;s, made him peevi&s;h at the &s;ight of all others. It was much &s;u&s;pected, that the King him&s;elf was the principal Author of the&s;e Demands, to the end that the&s;e two Per&s;ons might no more be &s;een at Court, nor in <HI>Paris.</HI> Though they had the Honour to be &s;o nearly related to the Duche&s;s of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> yet their Behaviour was altogether unworthy of their great Quality; for be&s;ides their Conduct, that was not very regular, they were both in extream Nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;o far from being in Circum&s;tances to &s;upport a Rank &s;uitable to their Birth, that they had hardly wherewith to maintain &s;ufficiently the Condition of very ordinary Per&s;ons; be&s;ides, the King was fain to &s;upply them by his Royal Bounty, without which they had often wanted the very Nece&s;&s;aries of Life. The elde&s;t was &s;ent to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> to keep Company with her Mother, who re&s;ided there; the other was &s;hut up among&s;t the <HI>Carmelites</HI> in the <HI>Suburbs</HI> of St. <HI>James,</HI> with expre&s;s Order to the <HI>Superior</HI> of the Convent, that &s;he &s;hould be permitted to &s;peak to none, but certain Ladies, who&s;e Names were tran&s;mitted to him in Writing. Madamoi&s;elle <HI>de Carignan</HI> might have ea&s;ily avoided this Indignity, if &s;he had had a mind; &s;he had been warn'd of it a long time before; and the King him&s;elf &s;ent her word, that if &s;he meant to plea&s;e him, &s;he would take a Maid of Honour of his Recommendation. At that time he offered her Apartments at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> with &s;ufficient Maintainance for that Lady of Honour; but &s;he excus'd her &s;elf, under pretence, that &s;he had one already, and that &s;he could not hand&s;omely accept of another, without expo&s;ing the fir&s;t.
<PB N="211" REF="370">
However &s;incere &s;he might have been in her Ex|cu&s;e, yet in a thing capable of a double entendre, People are more ready to take them in an ill Sen&s;e; every body believed that her Excu&s;e pro|ceeded only from the great de&s;ire &s;he had to conti|nue her Intrigue. But the King having put an end to it, after the manner above related, her Gal|lant was to look for his Comfort where he could find it.</P>
<P>In all appearance he could not be &s;o ea&s;ily com|forted, whether he thought that his Honour was concern'd, or that he was <HI>really</HI> afflicted, as he would have the World believe; he di&s;play'd his Wrath more than ever again&s;t his Wife, and though &s;he was reputed a Lady of intire Virtue, yet (as it was generally believ'd) he us'd often to lay hands upon her. But till that time, &s;he conceal'd very in|du&s;triou&s;ly what ju&s;t Rea&s;on &s;he had to exclaim again&s;t his Conduct; but after that, and &s;everal other Outrages, it was no more in her Power to di&s;&s;emble her ju&s;t Re&s;entment of them. She com|plain'd of them to all her Relations, that they might the more readily approve of her Intention to commence a <HI>Proce&s;s of Separation of Bodies</HI> again&s;t him, for &s;he had been of a long time <HI>&s;eparated</HI> in <HI>Goods,</HI> without which, &s;he and her two Children had been reduc'd to the greate&s;t <HI>Indigence.</HI> In effect, this Man's Conduct was &s;o mean, that he went often, not only without one Penny of Money, but with|out Cloaths and Hat. No body could di&s;approve of her de&s;ign, which &s;he put in Execution a few days after; and her Husband, who had retir'd from her &s;ome days before, told his Wife's Friends, that it was altogether needle&s;s for her to plead for a Sepa|ration from him, &s;ince for a long time he de&s;ir'd no better, and would allow the <HI>Sentence</HI> to pa&s;s whenever &s;he thought convenient. But there be|ing many more People who delight in Debauche|ry, than in vertuous <HI>Living;</HI> this Gentleman was
<PB N="212" REF="371">
neverthele&s;s acceptable in certain Companies, even Princes countenanc'd him as they had u&s;ually done; and being one day at the Duke of <HI>Chartres</HI>'s Table, there was by chance &s;ome <HI>Sauce</HI> dropp'd by one of the Attendants upon his Cloaths; and however Plain and Coar&s;e the&s;e Cloaths were, he was ex|treamly vex'd at the Accident; no wonder, for he had got no other in his Wardrobe for a change. This he told the young Prince betwixt Je&s;t and Vexation. The Prince &s;eem'd not to re|gard it, but talking with the Company, &s;aid, <HI>That ordinarily Misfortunes attended them who were lea&s;t able to &s;upport them.</HI> He intreated two or three Per|&s;ons of Quality, who were there, to go keep him Company the next day: <HI>For in all appearance,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>you'll find him in Bed while he &s;ends his Cloaths to the Scourers, and at lea&s;t that will be &s;ome Comfort to him.</HI> This poor Husband was actually oblig'd to do what the Duke &s;aid; but the next day the young Prince &s;ent him four Suits made by his own Taylor, to the end, that if any &s;uch misfortune befel him ano|ther time, it &s;hould never hinder him to appear as u&s;ually.</P>
<P>About that time the King caus'd to Arre&s;t one of the U&s;hers of his Chamber, one of the mo&s;t vi&s;io|nary Companions in the Univer&s;e, whom, not|with&s;tanding his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> allow'd to Di&s;cour&s;e with very often, in regard he dur&s;t not let his Folly ap|pear before the King, which he had not the wit to conceal in other Company. He had of a long time thought to cau&s;e Hang all the Seamen, from the Mar&s;hal <HI>D'E&s;tree</HI> and <HI>Tourville</HI> to the very meane&s;t. He pretended they were all Rogues, upon certain Memoirs which a Commi&s;&s;ary of the Marines (who was broke) had given him. He had impor|tun'd his Maje&s;ty a thou&s;and times upon it, and re|pre&s;ented to him, that if he would examine the Abu&s;es which had crept into the &s;everal Employ|ments of the&s;e Officers; he might find a fair op|portunity
<PB N="213" REF="372">
of rai&s;ing, ju&s;tly, a Tax upon them to the tune of Sixty Millions. It was about the mid|dle of the War when he &s;poke after this manner to the <HI>King;</HI> they had a deal of difficulty to rai&s;e Money, and therefore his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> thought the Ad|vice was not to be de&s;pis'd, and &s;uppo&s;ing there might be &s;omewhat in it, he &s;ent him to Mon|&s;ieur <HI>Pontchartrain:</HI> But that highly di&s;pleas'd this Extravagant Gentleman, who probably had a mind to regulate this Affair him&s;elf with his Maje&s;ty, or perhaps de&s;ign'd to involve that <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> in the&s;e pretended Malver&s;ations; for a Fool is capable of any Extravagancy. However, he was oblig'd to obey the <HI>King;</HI> there was hardly a Per&s;on to be found, who thought him&s;elf more able and fit for bu&s;ine&s;s than this Fool. But Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pontchartrain</HI> being as Prudent, as he was ra&s;h, knew pre&s;ently how little ground this <HI>Numskul</HI> had for what he advanc'd. He acquainted the King with it. His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> was much of the &s;ame Opinion; yet this Man, who had the opportunity to &s;peak to his Maje&s;ty, whenever he pleas'd, could not be per|&s;waded of his Error, but &s;till pre&s;ented new Memorials to him, by which he intreated him to appoint &s;ome other Commi&s;&s;ioners to hear him, who might have more lea&s;ure to examine the mat|ter, than Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pontchartrain;</HI> offering upon pain of Death to make out what he advanc'd to be as clear as Day-light. This <HI>Confidence</HI> of his, together with &s;ome &s;ecret <HI>Springs</HI> he &s;et at work, made the King re&s;olve to give him a <HI>Hearing.</HI> He obtain'd al&s;o &s;ome <HI>Acts of Council,</HI> by which he pretended to give a light to &s;ome ob&s;cure Affairs. From that time forward, this ra&s;h <HI>Numskul</HI> never &s;aw any of the Officers of the Marine enter into the King's Chamber, but he told to &s;uch as were by him, that the&s;e Gentlemen were to be tax'd in immen&s;e Sums; one in two Millions, &s;ome in more, &s;ome in le&s;s; and he though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t him&s;elf already one of the

fir&s;t <HI>Peers</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> becau&s;e he had ask'd of his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> a &s;hare of what was to be recover'd of the&s;e Gentlemen by the Tax; and the <HI>King</HI> had granted it to him; but him&s;elf had promis'd a &s;hare of it to &s;uch as were capable to ingratiate him with his <HI>Maje&s;ty.</HI> This mu&s;t needs have been very di&s;a|greeable to the Per&s;on concern'd. However, this little Gentleman forgot him&s;elf more and more daily, even to that degree of Impudence, as to vaunt, that notwith&s;tanding all what Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pont|chartrain</HI> was able to do, he did not doubt in the lea&s;t to &s;ucceed in his Enterprize. In fine, That <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> being no longer able to bear with his Extra|vagancies, made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to repre&s;ent them to the King. He had &s;lighted them long before, as well as the Per&s;on who was guilty of them. He thought him only unworthy to be regarded; but every one told him, That his Intere&s;t was concern'd more than he was aware of, in making his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> acquainted with the truth of the Affair, for he ha|ving the whole Power of the Sea-Affairs, it &s;eem'd as if he accus'd him under-hand, of conniving at the&s;e pretended Abu&s;es, that he &s;uffer'd in others. So he was at la&s;t prevail'd upon by the&s;e Rea&s;ons; and therefore made known to the King, that this Man was only an extravagant mad Fool, fitter to be &s;ent to <HI>Bedlam,</HI> than countenanc'd by &s;o great a King; that his Impudence, or rather his Madne&s;s, appear'd too evidently, in daring to accu&s;e two <HI>Mar|&s;hals</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> together with the whole Body of the Sea-Officers, without any regard to &s;o many Per|&s;ons among&s;t them, equally con&s;iderable for their Services, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by their Quality; and very incapable of doing any thing again&s;t their Du|ty; who came daily to him to demand Ju&s;tice of that Fool for his In&s;olence, and intreated him ear|ne&s;tly to repre&s;ent it to his Maje&s;ty. He added that he hop'd, that his Maje&s;ty would cau&s;e to examine once for all, the Accu&s;ations of that unaccountable
<PB N="215" REF="374">
Fool, to the end he might be confounded, when it &s;hould be made manife&s;t that the Accu&s;ation was ra|ther vi&s;ionary than real.</P>
<P>The King having heard this <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> very atten|tively, promis'd to do all he demanded, without loo&s;ing any time. Accordingly he commanded the Commi&s;&s;ioners whom he had ordain'd to exa|mine that Affair, to &s;earch narrowly into it. The Commi&s;&s;ioners apply'd them&s;elves pre&s;ently to it, and having di&s;cover'd that all what he advanc'd, was in effect nothing el&s;e but the Imagination of his empty Brain, they gave his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> a full account of it. The King immediately forbid that Man ever to trouble him any more with that Affair; but he not being wi&s;e enough to take the advantage of this Advice, would &s;till in&s;i&s;t as formerly, and had al|mo&s;t &s;aid, that all of them had con&s;pir'd to &s;ave the guilty. The King told him a &s;econd time, that he commanded him ab&s;olutely never to &s;peak to him of that Affair, though he was &s;o good as to conceal what he had rea&s;on to believe of him. This Man thought at la&s;t his be&s;t way was to di&s;|&s;emble, and obey his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> in appearance. But while he &s;eem'd to be &s;ilent, he left no Stone un|turn'd to return to his former Trade. He brought over the Knight of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to his &s;ide, in order to engage the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> in the Affair; and tho' &s;uch eternal <HI>Protens</HI>'s as this Knight, are little to be credited, yet he made u&s;e of his Intere&s;t with that Prince to &s;ucceed in his de&s;ign. The <HI>Duke</HI> &s;poke of it to his <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> who was exceedingly &s;ur|prized, that this little Gentleman dar'd to fall upon the&s;e Methods, after he had expre&s;ly forbid him. He told freely his Sentiments of it to the Duke, and forbid him ever to concern him&s;elf with &s;uch Affairs. From that time the King re&s;olv'd to get rid of him, though it is always again&s;t his Inclina|tion, when he falls upon &s;uch extream Mea&s;ures with any, who had the Honour to be his Dome|&s;tick;

It's true, he had been twice at the <HI>Duke</HI>'s Lodgings after he had done it, without having the opportunity of meeting with him.

This Petition was pre&s;ented to his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> before the <HI>Duke</HI> had time to return home, and the King made mention of it to the Duke.

<P>The Sea-Officers were not the only Per&s;ons who were accus'd unju&s;tly. There came about that time a certain Abbot of Quality from a Foreign Country, of whom they took the liberty to &s;ay no better things. For they accus'd him of having de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with King <HI>William,</HI> before the Peace was &s;ign'd, and to per&s;wade him, that he ought not to think of making a Peace with <HI>France,</HI> for that <HI>France</HI> could not fail to be ab&s;olutely de&s;troy'd, if the War was con|tinued two Years longer. His Family being one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all <HI>Britain,</HI> was extreamly afflicted when they heard him talk'd of after that manner, e&s;pecially his elde&s;t Brother, who was in the Service, and pretty well advanc'd. He dur&s;t not &s;hew him&s;elf any more to the <HI>King,</HI> fearing his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> would make him an&s;werable for the Crime alledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d again&s;t his Brother. Neverthele&s;s, his Ma|je&s;ty, after the Example of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> had long before explain'd him&s;elf upon that Head, &s;aying in pre&s;ence of all the Court, <HI>That every one &s;hould bear his own Crime, and that Relations were not to be an&s;wer|able for the Iniquities of their Relations:</HI> And in effect, one of the <HI>Mu&s;queteers</HI> having committed a horrid Murder in the Year 1676. His <HI>Majesty</HI> knew no &s;ooner that his Brother, who was a Captain of Hor&s;e, was &s;o extreamly afflicted at it, that he de&s;ign'd to make his e&s;cape into the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> than he ad|vanc'd him in the Life-Guards.

He
<PB N="218" REF="377">
knew very well, that his little Band never hindred him from doing many things, which reflected migh|tily upon that Habit. He had occa&s;ion'd a Divorce betwixt a Husband and a Wife. He carried on an amorous Intrigue with a Pre&s;ident's Wife, which occa&s;ion'd great wrangling betwixt them; nor had the Husband &s;topt his Re&s;entment there, if his Re|lations and Friends had not convinc'd him, that a great many Chances attend our Lives, which it were better to conceal than declare. The&s;e things he partly believ'd, but it was not in his Power to hinder him&s;elf from Murmuring, which did the <HI>Abbot</HI> a great deal of injury, who both by his Quali|ty and his Brother's Service, pretended to have alrea|dy a good <HI>Abbey,</HI> but now &s;aw him&s;elf a thou&s;and Miles di&s;tant from it. The King, who de&s;ires that every one &s;hould mind his Duty, that is to &s;ay, that a Soldier be a Man of Courage, that a Judge be Ju&s;t, and a Church-man Hone&s;t and Pious; no &s;ooner knew that he made it his practice to De|bauch other Men's Wives, in&s;tead of confirming them in Virtue, than he ab&s;olutely forbid Father <HI>de la Chai&s;e,</HI> (who had put him down in his Pocket-Book, in order to have a good Benefice) ever to propo&s;e him any more as a Subject worthy of any Dignity.</P>
<P>The poor <HI>Abbot,</HI> who had more <HI>Quality</HI> than <HI>Riches,</HI> was extreamly vext to &s;ee his hopes &s;o fru&s;trated by his own faults. However, knowing that there was Mercy for all Sins, he put him&s;elf into a <HI>Seminary,</HI> Whether he truly repented of what he had done, or would make the World believe he did &s;o; by the&s;e means he meant to free his <HI>Majesty</HI> of the bad Impre&s;&s;ion he might have of his Conduct, and in&s;inuate him&s;elf into his Favour. The King, who is a very Judicious Prince, and is &s;eldom or never mi&s;taken in his Opinion of Per&s;ons, did not allow him&s;elf to be impos'd upon by that Change, &s;o very different from his former Life. For he Preach'd,
<PB N="119" REF="378">
Fa&s;ted, and Catechiz'd; and in a word, there was not one Church-man, not only in the <HI>Seminaries,</HI> but even within twenty Leagues round it, who&s;e Conduct was more Exemplary than his. Father <HI>de la Chai&s;e</HI> was very de&s;irous to oblige him, but could never comprehend whence aro&s;e the <HI>King</HI>'s Aver|&s;ion for him; being naturally good, and more in|clin'd to judge well than ill of any Per&s;on, he took occa&s;ion to &s;peak to his <HI>Majesty</HI> of him, and repre&s;ented to him, that the Au&s;terity of his Life, and his regular Conduct, did not only de&s;erve an <HI>Abbey,</HI> but even a <HI>Bi&s;hoprick;</HI> that the greate&s;t Sin|ners become ordinarily the greate&s;t Saints; and if <HI>God Almighty</HI> were like him, they mu&s;t blot out of the Calendar a great many Saints; who after ha|ving committed very great Crimes, had &s;hew'd the Abbot the way he follow'd at pre&s;ent. The King was nothing mov'd at his Confe&s;&s;or's Di&s;cour&s;e. On the contrary he an&s;wer'd him, that he might blot him out of the Li&s;t of Bi&s;hops, as he had done a while ago out of the Li&s;t of Abbots, for he never would honour him with that Dignity.</P>
<P>I do not know, if ever this An&s;wer was made known to the Abbot, or if he was already weary of pa&s;&s;ing his Days in a <HI>Seminary,</HI> and waiting &s;o long time for a Benefice, of which he &s;aw no ap|pearance; whatever was the matter, he chang'd his <HI>Re&s;idence</HI> very &s;oon. It's true, it did not renew his Intrigue with the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI>'s Wife, or with any other. On the contrary, he avoided all for a long time, as if he meant to continue the Life that he made &s;o great a &s;hew of in the Eyes of all <HI>France.</HI> But whether he &s;aw that they would eye him nar|rowly, or that he intended to continue his Cour&s;e, he pa&s;s'd into <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he apply'd him&s;elf to Catechizing every day: He al&s;o began to a&s;&s;i&s;t dy|ing Per&s;ons; and the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Blanch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ford,</HI> &s;e|cond Son to the Duke of <HI>Crequi,</HI> falling Sick about that time, it was he that exhorted him to prepare

him&s;elf for the Pa&s;&s;age that appears &s;o terrible, e&s;pe|cially to tho&s;e of &s;uch a youthful Age as he was of. Father <HI>de la Chai&s;e</HI> took occa&s;ion upon this al&s;o, to &s;peak to the <HI>King</HI> in favour of this <HI>Abbot.</HI> He told him, that the Abbot did not require his Pre&s;ence to oblige him to good Actions, and &s;o he could not be reproach'd (as a great many others might ju&s;tly be) with Hypocri&s;y. But the King nothing mov'd by this new Attack, an&s;wer'd, <HI>That he could never per&s;wade him but that the Abbot was no good Man; that time would di&s;cover very &s;oon which of them was mo&s;t deceived, but he did not believe it was him&s;elf.</HI> Father <HI>de la Chai&s;e</HI> reply'd, <HI>That he was afraid his Maje&s;ty of|fended</HI> God Almighty, <HI>in judging &s;o badly of his Neigh|bour.</HI> But his Maje&s;ty return'd it &s;martly home, in &s;aying, <HI>That he was afraid, that he offended him more, in de&s;iring him to give a Bi&s;hoprick to a Man, whom he thought altogether unworthy of it.</HI> I know not whe|ther this An&s;wer came to the Abbot's Ears, but all of a &s;udden he left the great de&s;ire he had &s;hown (while in <HI>Flanders</HI>) to Catechize Men; and without acquainting any Per&s;on with his de&s;ign, went into <HI>Holland</HI> to care&s;s the Women there; at lea&s;t he was &s;een doing it &s;oon after his arrival. However, his going often to the Hou&s;e of one of the Plenipoten|tiaries, gave occa&s;ion to &s;ome People to &s;ay, <HI>That this</HI> Preacher <HI>was not only debauch'd, but al&s;o a very dangerous M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n.</HI> In a word, he was &s;u&s;pected to have given not only Memoirs to that Amba&s;&s;ador, but al&s;o to have had a private Interview with King <HI>William,</HI> and reveal'd to him a great many Secrets. However, all that was fal&s;e, nor had he any other de&s;ign to go &s;o often to that Amba&s;&s;ador's, than to pay his Re&s;pects to a Per&s;on who fill'd the Pre&s;i|dent's Lady's Room in his Heart. She was al&s;o &s;omewhat more de&s;erving than the other, without doing her any inju&s;tice. However, as one Lye ge|neral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y begets a great many among&s;t tho&s;e who vent them; the next Day all <HI>Paris</HI> would have it,
<PB N="221" REF="380">
that the King had wrote to King <HI>William</HI> to entreat him, to &s;end him the <HI>Abbot</HI> bound Hand and Foot; they made it al&s;o known to the pretended Crimi|nal by a Letter un&s;ign'd, and the Hand-writing was altogether unknown to him; but advi&s;ed him, if it came &s;ea&s;onably to his Hand, he would make it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ave him&s;elf by flying to <HI>Turky,</HI> rather than &s;uffer him&s;elf to be taken.</P>
<P>The poor Abbot was much a&s;toni&s;hed at this Ac|cu&s;ation; if they had accus'd him of being Amorous, he had been oblig'd to own it, becau&s;e it was true. Neither the <HI>Seminary</HI> where he had been, nor the Mortifications which <HI>Pere de la Chai&s;e</HI> had advanc'd &s;o much in his Favour to the <HI>King,</HI> were capable to wean him from that unhappy Pa&s;&s;ion to which (to his great Misfortune) he was very &s;ubject. In fine, knowing him&s;elf not only Innocent, but al&s;o unca|pable of the crime laid to his Charge, he went to wait upon Mon&s;ieur <HI>Harlai,</HI> in order to ask him, if he had receiv'd the <HI>Order,</HI> of which they had given him Advice &s;ecretly; if &s;o, he came to put him&s;elf into his Hands, &s;o that it would not be nece&s;&s;ary to Arre&s;t him; and if it was &s;ent to any other Per&s;on, he came however to deliver him&s;elf Pri&s;oner to him, that they might not be at the trouble to &s;earch for him; he intreated him to acquaint the King with it, that his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> might be &s;atisfied of his In|nocence, until he could make it evident before any Commi&s;&s;ioners his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be pleas'd to ap|point. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Harlai</HI> had heard &s;omewhat of the Matter before. This oblig'd him to examine his Conduct, and to &s;et &s;ome Spies upon him, in order to watch whither he went at &s;ome certain hours; for he judg'd that it mu&s;t needs be about that time that he was mo&s;t bu&s;ied about his Trea&s;on, if Fame was to be believ'd; but at la&s;t, the&s;e Spies reported to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Harlai,</HI> that he was altogether took up about his <HI>Mi&s;tri&s;s,</HI> which ju&s;tified him &s;o
<PB N="222" REF="381">
much in his Opinion, that he gave him to know, he wi&s;h'd with all his heart, the Pri&s;on he was en|gag'd in, might not prove more trouble&s;ome to him, than what he came to look for at his Hou&s;e; that it would not prove very hard for him to break his Chains, becau&s;e he not only declar'd him free, but al&s;o Innocent of what was laid to his Charge, as far as con&s;i&s;ted with his Power. However he believ'd, that his Heart was not &s;o much upon the <HI>French,</HI> as it had formerly been; but as it's impo|&s;&s;ible to be always in Love, he was per&s;waded it might return to its former Inclination when he thought lea&s;t of it; and by the&s;e means he might be at ea&s;e, for he would &s;ecure him, none would impute to him this as a great Crime. In effect, this was the Abbot's Crime: And though he was &s;helter'd in it from all he was threaten'd with; neverthele&s;s he was not &s;o happy as to continue always in the good E&s;teem of Father <HI>de la Chai&s;e.</HI> He dur&s;t not &s;peak any more in his Favour to his <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> con&s;idering he had &s;et up a <HI>Holland</HI> Lady in the place of the Pre&s;ident's: His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> ask'd al&s;o that good Father, if he was now con|vinc'd, and if he intended &s;till to demand a Bi&s;ho|prick for that Abbot. The Je&s;uit was &s;omewhat humbled at that Reproach, and all he could &s;ay for his Ju&s;tification, was that he could not hin|der him&s;elf from being impos'd upon, by the Tricks of an Hypocrite, no more than any body el&s;e.</P>
<P>But if his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> was proof again&s;t the Recom|mendations of his Father Confe&s;&s;or, who&s;e Opi|nion in Matters of that Nature gains generally the <HI>King</HI>'s Con&s;ent, the Ca&s;e was quite different with regard to another <HI>Abbot,</HI> whom this good Father protected al&s;o.

And to that end, by the means of very good Friends, apply'd him&s;elf to Father <HI>de la Chai&s;e,</HI> upon whom he believ'd all the&s;e Matters depended. This good Father told him, <HI>That he did him&s;elf an inju&s;tice in re&s;tricting him&s;elf to &s;o narrow Bounds, and that he ought to ask &s;ome better thing, for he could hope to obtain it.</HI> The Abbot was over-joy'd to hear him &s;peak after that manner; and as generally a good Appetite increa&s;es by eating; &s;o this Gentleman of a little Abbot, was now very de&s;irous to become a fat Bi&s;hop. However, he dur&s;t not mention it &s;uddenly to <HI>Pere de la Chai&s;e,</HI> but the good Father gave him to know, that the Dig|nity he enjoy'd already in the Cathedral, render'd him worthy of the other, e&s;pecially when it was joyn'd to all the other Qualities requi&s;ite for a Bi|&s;hop; &s;o he got him&s;elf to be li&s;ted in the Catalogue of the Candidates for the <HI>Epi&s;copal Dignity.</HI> How|ever, he continued at <HI>Paris</HI> until the King had fill'd up &s;ome vacant Bi&s;hopricks, which had Pretenders enough. For now the Scene is alter'd from what it was formerly, among&s;t tho&s;e, upon whom they conferr'd that Dignity, who &s;aid ingenuou&s;ly, <HI>Nolo Epi&s;copari:</HI> I will not be a Bi&s;hop.

<P>The Abbot of <HI>Coadlet,</HI> who knew pretty well the Secret how to come by it, was not &s;ufficiently &s;a|tisfied to hear only Father <HI>de la Chai&s;e</HI> for him, tho' he was the be&s;t Friend he could employ, but he apply'd him&s;elf to others al&s;o, who were capable to do him as con&s;iderable Service as the former. For he thought as in legal Proce&s;&s;es, abundance of the Law breaks not the Law; &s;o in offers of this nature, he could never make u&s;e of too many on his behalf. However, as there are many, who Ruin them&s;elves in making u&s;e of the Methods that others &s;ave them&s;elves by; &s;o he found that what he took to be of greate&s;t advantage, prov'd mo&s;t de&s;tructive, and that to &s;uch a degree, that it's impo&s;&s;ible for him ever to retrieve it.

That Lady promis'd him her Favour, and was as good as her Word. But he having likewi&s;e heard that old Wo|men have not &s;o much Intere&s;t as young ones, quickly abandon'd her, and took up with her Daughter-in-law, whom he took to be more capa|ble to &s;erve him. He waited upon her punctually every day; and in the Holy-week, he happening to be at her Hou&s;e, had not the power to refu&s;e to accept of a match at <HI>Ombre</HI> that &s;he propos'd to him; &s;ome &s;ay it was <HI>Ba&s;&s;ette;</HI> but either of 'em is equally criminal before God, unle&s;s it be that the one is a greater In&s;trument of Pa&s;&s;ion than the other.

This reflected in &s;ome mea&s;ure upon the <HI>Good Father,</HI> who had told him Wonders of this Man, the more to oblige tho&s;e who had recommended him; and perhaps he him&s;elf believ'd all was told him to the advantage of that Per&s;on. However, the Je&s;uit altogether amaz'd at the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, made u&s;e of the Au|thority he had over his <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> to oblige him to change his Re&s;olution. Though it was ea&s;y for him to judge, by what the King had &s;aid, that of nece&s;&s;ity &s;ome People had given him a &s;trange Character of that poor Abbot; yet he &s;aid, That
<PB N="227" REF="386">
we mu&s;t not believe upon light grounds, all that we hear of our Neighbour, that he had often re|commended to him the reading of the little Book of the <HI>Imitation</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and there he might &s;ee a Chapter done purpo&s;ely upon that Subject; that <HI>Lying</HI> abounded in a great mea&s;ure among&s;t Men, as well as Jealou&s;y; in&s;omuch, that his Maje&s;ty's Bounty was &s;ufficient to move all the Malice of Hell again&s;t him.</P>
<P>The King having hearken'd attentively to what he &s;aid, reply'd, <HI>That it was no Lye they told him, as he imagin'd; that it was a thing happen'd lately in the pre&s;ence of a great many, that he al&s;o knew the Witne&s;&s;es; in&s;omuch, that he had not the lea&s;t ground to doubt of it.</HI> The <HI>Good Father</HI> de&s;ir'd to know what the matter was; the King made no Secret of it, adding moreover, <HI>That if Fame was to be cre|dited, that Abbot was no le&s;s a Lover of the</HI> Sex <HI>than of Game.</HI> And in effect, this was told the King with a great deal of a&s;&s;urance; but whether he lov'd them or no, for I know no body hates them; it was certain that he gave no Scandal to the World that way, as his Enemies alledg'd; &s;o the King was &s;oon per&s;waded that he was impos'd upon in that Affair. However, Father <HI>de la Chai&s;e</HI> &s;eeing that the other was a weighty Accu&s;ation, and that the King kept clo&s;e to it, he thought of throwing &s;ome &s;cruple into his Mind. He told him then, That there was more of Infirmity than of Crime in what the Abbot had done; that it was certain, it was rather out of Complai&s;ance than Inclination, or want of due Re&s;pect to the&s;e <HI>Holy-Days,</HI> that he had handled the Cards at that time; that very few People knew of this his fault, but now all <HI>France</HI> would begin to pry into it, and even &s;u&s;pect an infinity of things, as &s;oon as his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> &s;hould deprive him of what he had once conferr'd upon him; that his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> ought
<PB N="228" REF="387">
to be very cautions in giving that Scandal to his People, that certainly he mu&s;t be an&s;werable for it before <HI>God:</HI> That a &s;mall Reproof given in &s;ecret to that <HI>Abbot,</HI> would prevail more with him, and oblige him to ask <HI>God</HI> pardon for what he had done, and by this means all would be buried in Oblivion; that after all, it ought not to be re|garded as a heinous fault, but in re&s;pect to the time it was committed, for he was not the only Eccle&s;ia&s;tick who a had Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Game;</HI> &s;ince there were many <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Abbots,</HI> who made it their principal Exerci&s;e; though after all, they were not depriv'd of their <HI>Bi&s;hoprick</HI> and <HI>Abbots</HI> upon that ac|count. He own'd freely to his <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> it were more decent for them not to do it, and was of Opinion, that the&s;e things ought to be none of their Diver&s;ions. But in fine, the Spirit of Man|kind is weak, and there being four and twenty Hours in the Day, it is impo&s;&s;ible to employ them all in Exerci&s;es of Piety, and therefore they are allow'd to refre&s;h them&s;elves with innocent Recre|ations.</P>
<P>The King had no great opinion of this Morali|ty, he thought it too loo&s;e, e&s;pecially with regard to tho&s;e Men who were the Subject of the Di&s;|cour&s;e. For he put a va&s;t difference betwixt them and a Courtier, or a Man of the Sword, whom he thought might be allow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;uch things; but to believe that Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks ought to have the &s;ame extent of freedom, was a thing, with all due Re|&s;pect to his <HI>Father Confe&s;&s;or,</HI> he could never be per|&s;waded off. So it being impo&s;&s;ible to convince his Maje&s;ty by this Objection, he was fain to have recour&s;e to &s;ome other Argument. He in&s;i&s;ted upon the Scandal he was like to give, but that gaining nothing upon him, he pray<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d him to advi&s;e with Heaven before he would determine ab&s;olutely the matter. His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> con&s;ented willingly. For in
<PB N="229" REF="388">
that he demanded only what became a good Chri|&s;tian, and was conformable to the Inclination of this Prince. So the King kneeling that very mi|nute upon a Cu&s;hion, Father <HI>de la Chai&s;e</HI> kneel'd by him, to make him &s;ay the Prayers which he de|&s;ir'd. Prayers being ended, the <HI>Good Father</HI> ask'd him what return the <HI>Lord</HI> made. His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> re|ply'd, <HI>Nothing of what you wi&s;h'd for, and that he was as re&s;olute as formerly to execute his de&s;ign.</HI> He added, <HI>That he &s;aw it very inconvenient not to do it; for if he &s;hould make that</HI> Abbot <HI>a</HI> Bi&s;hop, <HI>and if he &s;hould neglect his Duty in his Dioce&s;s, God Almighty would one day call him to an Account for it; that he had faults enough of his own to an&s;wer for, without taking upon him tho&s;e of other People; and he believ'd him too Good, and too Pious, to advi&s;e him otherwi&s;e.</HI> The <HI>Good Father</HI> was not yet put off with that An&s;wer. He ask'd of the <HI>King</HI> as the la&s;t Favour, to &s;u&s;pend his Re&s;olution until he &s;hould return from <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> whither he was ju&s;t agoing. He conjur'd him to invoke earne&s;tly the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> that he might en|lighten him. The <HI>King</HI> conde&s;cended very wil|lingly; but not having receiv'd the In&s;piration which the <HI>Good Father</HI> pretended, he declar'd, <HI>That he had blotted that Abbot out of the</HI> Li&s;t, <HI>be|cau&s;e he did not believe him &s;o proper for a Bi&s;hoprick as he at fir&s;t imagin'd.</HI> The poor <HI>Abbot</HI> of <HI>Coadles</HI> heard of the&s;e News with all the Surpri&s;al and Grief imaginable. He retir'd into a <HI>Seminary,</HI> there to bury his Vexation However, the King calling to mind what Father <HI>de la Chai&s;e</HI> had &s;aid to him, and being de&s;irous that he &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of nothing but the <HI>Truth,</HI> declar'd at the &s;ame time, before all the Court, <HI>That what that Abbot had done in the</HI> Holy Week, <HI>was the only cau&s;e of his Misfor|tune; that whatever el&s;e was &s;aid of him was fal&s;e, and that he was oblig'd to give that Te&s;timony in his Favour.</HI></P>

The <HI>King</HI> having &s;how'd him&s;elf &s;o full of the fear of <HI>God</HI> in an Affair of &s;o great Con&s;equence, &s;hew'd him&s;elf equally full of Ju&s;tice in another Affair that concern'd a Man of the &s;ame Coun|try. Which was as follows: a Coun&s;ellor of the Parliament of <HI>Britany,</HI> call'd <HI>Montchamp,</HI> having cudgell'd the Nephew of <HI>Moreau,</HI> the famous <HI>Actre&s;s</HI> in the Opera; and who gave &s;ome ground to &s;peak of her upon an account different from what &s;he acted upon the <HI>Theatre;</HI> the young Man carried his Complaint to his <HI>Maje&s;ty.</HI> The Coun|&s;ellor expected that his Intere&s;t in the Parliament, in who&s;e A&s;&s;embly that Affair was done, would &s;helter him from all Accidents. He treated alrea|dy that Man very &s;lightingly and meanly. But the Lady of that Opera, whom Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t Quality ador'd, having e&s;pous'd her Nephew's Quarrel, obtain'd a private Letter in his favour. This Letter enjoyn'd the Parliament expre&s;ly to do the Plantiff &s;o good, and &s;o ready Ju&s;tice, that he &s;hould have no rea&s;on to complain of it. <HI>Montchamp</HI> under&s;tanding by the&s;e means, that he had to do with a more powerful Party than he thought of; had recour&s;e to &s;uch Tricks as are u&s;ual among the People of his Trade. He made a diligent Inquiry into the Life, not of the Aunt, (for it had been no difficulty in the lea&s;t to prove a great many things of her) but of the Nephew. For he thought that if he could d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">over any un|warrantable Action in it, as he hop'd he might, he could at lea&s;t retard the Proce&s;s, which his Adver|&s;ary had commenc'd again&s;t him.

This <HI>Actre&s;s</HI> was no &s;ooner apply'd to, than &s;he &s;tood aloof. The <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI>'s Lady threaten'd her with the di&s;covery the <HI>Coun&s;ellor</HI> made in her Ne|phew's Life, on purpo&s;e to fright her. But whe|ther &s;he was afraid of nothing from that Facti|on, or that &s;he thought &s;he had Friends enough to protect her, &s;he carried her Preten&s;ions &s;o high as to demand Ten thou&s;and Crowns of the <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI>'s Lady for her Nephew's Intere&s;t and Damages. As &s;oon as the Lady had acquainted her Relations that there was no hopes of an Ac|commodation for him, he &s;poke very &s;cornfully of &s;uch an exorbitant Demand; &s;o applying him|&s;elf altogether to a vigorous Defence, he would certainly have confounded the oppo&s;ite Party, if the Parliament had conde&s;cended to it. He gave in a Petition again&s;t the <HI>Plaintiff,</HI> &s;hewing that he had two Wives. He de&s;ir'd to have a Decret pa&s;s'd again&s;t him; but bringing no valid proof for his Accu&s;ation, the <HI>Parliament</HI> dur&s;t not declare in his Favour, for fear of a Reprimand from the Court.

In fine, <HI>Montchamp</HI> failing in his Expectation, and not being able to produce any Proof for what he alledg'd; though he had employ'd &s;ome con&s;ider|able Per&s;ons in it, Sentence was pronounc'd upon the Affair.

The <HI>Appeal,</HI> in&s;tead of being brought before the Parliament, according to the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, was brought be|fore the Great Council. The Mea&s;ures of the <HI>Marqui&s;s</HI>'s Friends and Relations being by this means quite defeated, they advis'd him to keep him&s;elf clo&s;e where he was, for &s;eeing his Affairs had taken &s;o fatal a turn, it was by no means &s;afe for him to return into the Kingdom.

<P>The <HI>Marquis</HI>'s Relations were &s;en&s;ible of what importance it was for them to weather this Storm; for if once the <HI>King</HI> di&s;pos'd of his Regiment, it would not only prove a mortal Stroke to his For|tune, that was already pretty low, but the World would al&s;o look upon it as a &s;ort of Conviction again&s;t him. They therefore &s;upplicated his <HI>Ma|je&s;ty</HI> that he would be pleas'd to delay that Affair for &s;ome &s;mall time, promi&s;ing to oblige their Kin&s;man to return quickly in order to clear him|&s;elf of the Crime laid to his charge; and alledg|ing he was reduc'd to mean Circum&s;tances, upon which account it would be equally acceptable to take away his Life, as his Regiment. The King, in con&s;ideration of their Services, granted their Reque&s;t. And the Marquis of <HI>Se&s;ane</HI> was oblig'd to provide for him&s;elf &s;omewhere el&s;e, if he meant to have a Regiment.

<P>This Pre&s;ident's Wife was a Gentleman's Daugh|ter, who&s;e Office it was to give out the Powder, by which he had got immen&s;e Sums of Money.

But the&s;e <HI>Furies</HI> made them to know very quickly by falling &s;uddenly upon them; that its altogether as dangerous to fall into the Hands of <HI>Scholars,</HI> as into the Hands of the mo&s;t barbarous <HI>Hangman</HI> upon Earth. Some pull'd off their Cloaks, others their Gowns, while another Party unty'd their Breeches, another pull'd up their Shirts, the young <HI>Ombreval</HI> &s;erv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d for Executioner, together with another of the &s;ame Family, who had con&s;ign'd his Money in order to be a Councellor of Parlia|ment.</P>
<P>All the People got to the Windows upon the noi&s;e the&s;e poor Je&s;uits made, to call to the Neigh|bours for A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and among others, a pretty young Girl, who was more zealous than the re&s;t, to hinder them from receiving any greater Affront, cry'd aloud, that it de&s;erv'd a &s;evere Puni&s;hment, as in effect it did; but perceiving &s;he was not heard, &s;he went down Stairs to &s;ee if her <HI>Pre&s;ence</HI> could have a greater Influence than her <HI>Words;</HI> but alas! her Charity co&s;t her very dear. For the&s;e Scho|lars, who were far from having &s;o much good na|ture as &s;he, &s;eeing her e&s;pou&s;e &s;o earne&s;tly the part of the&s;e good Fathers, that &s;he reproach'd them for their Inju&s;tice; &s;eiz'd her al&s;o, pull'd up her
<PB N="238" REF="397">
Peticoats behind, and whipp'd her as they had done the Je&s;uits. After that, &s;he pleaded no more for them, but as &s;oon as &s;he got out of their Hands, &s;he run in and &s;hut the Doors, and got up to her Chamber in great Confu&s;ion and Vexation at her Adventure. The Je&s;uits had rea&s;on to be no le&s;s vex'd. However, though the &s;ame fate hap|pen'd to them all, they having been all three whipp'd in the open Streets; there was &s;till this difference in the Sequel, that the Adventure prov'd more fatal to the Girl than to them. The Fraternity receiv'd them always with the &s;ame kindne&s;s into the Convent. They vow'd al&s;o to revenge it in a little time, or dye in the Attempt; whereas the Girl was abandon'd by her Lover, and &s;wore he would not have her; they had agreed upon their Marriage, and the Articles had been already &s;ign'd, but he fearing that if he proceeded further, he might be call'd all over the Town, <HI>The Husband of the whipp'd Girl,</HI> could not endure to hear it &s;poken of. They threaten'd to pro&s;ecute him, if he did not make good his Promi&s;e. He an&s;wer'd, <HI>He valu'd it not, and that he would defend him&s;elf the be&s;t way he could;</HI> and its probable his Rea&s;ons might have prevail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d, for every one condemn'd the Indi&s;|cretion of the Girl, to meddle where &s;he was &s;o lit|tle concern'd.</P>
<P>This Action was too publick, and too bold, not to &s;pread in an in&s;tant over all <HI>Paris.</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>D' Argen&s;on</HI> had &s;oon advice of it, and it being his Duty to find out Criminals, he &s;ent &s;o many of his Spies abroad, that he &s;oon di&s;cover'd young <HI>Ombreval</HI> to be one of them. He al&s;o knew, that this Gentleman began the Fray, and was one of the Executioners, through who&s;e Hands tho&s;e Je|&s;uits had pa&s;s'd. He likewi&s;e found out the other's Name, who had executed the &s;ame Office, and caus'd them both to be taken up. Pre&s;ident <HI>Novion</HI>

was extreamly offended at him, as if he ought to have that deference for him, as not to treat after that manner a Per&s;on that concern'd him &s;o nearly. But this Vanity and Haughtine&s;s were very familiar to that Family, though it was of a far later &s;tand|ing than Mon&s;ieur <HI>D' Argen&s;on</HI>'s. Before St. <HI>Innocent</HI>'s <HI>Shrine</HI> was alter'd, which was but lately, we had an <HI>Epitaph</HI> extant, that &s;hows &s;ufficiently, they have neither &s;o much <HI>Nobility</HI> nor <HI>Grandeur</HI> in their <HI>Race,</HI> as they would make the World believe. It is far different from what we &s;ee at this time in the <HI>Cele&s;tines,</HI> where the Duke of <HI>Gevres,</HI> one of that Family would have us believe, that he is lineally de&s;cended from St. <HI>Louis.</HI> Though the Family be only come from a <HI>Merchand,</HI> one <HI>Fourner,</HI> who made his Son an <HI>Advocate,</HI> and that Son laid the Foundation of the va&s;t <HI>Grandeur.</HI> However it be, Pre&s;ident <HI>Novion</HI> minding that le&s;s than the Po&s;t he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, thought him&s;elf far above Mon&s;ieur <HI>D' Ar|gen&s;on,</HI> and wrote to him very di&s;re&s;pectfully upon what he had done. Mon&s;ieur <HI>D' Argen&s;on</HI> regarding his Letter very little, went on in his ordinary Cour&s;e, &s;o that the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> was fain to take his Nephew out of Pri&s;on, and his Companion came out after the &s;ame manner: Both of them had a good many Friends, and the Accu&s;ation they were charg'd with, being de&s;titute of Proof &s;ufficient to bring them to a Tryal, they were very happily clear'd of it. This was all the Je&s;uits had for their Satisfaction, and the poor whipp'd Girl for her's; be&s;ides the Mortification of having mi&s;s'd of a Hu&s;|band, together with the Grief and Indignity &s;he re|ceiv'd.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>New King</HI> of <HI>England</HI> &s;ent a <HI>New Amba&s;&s;ador</HI> to Court, namely, the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> his old Favourite. For the Earl of <HI>Albe|marle</HI> only &s;ucceeded to him, if I may &s;ay &s;o; for though he was his <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty's Darling,
<PB N="240" REF="399">
yet <HI>Portland</HI> was in as good Terms with his Ma&s;ter as ever. Moreover he had this advantage over the other, that be&s;ides the Favour which was common to them both, he was confided in. This <HI>Earl</HI> renew'd that <HI>Grandeur</HI> at our Court, which was to be &s;een in the time of the Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham,</HI> when he came to demand in Marriage for the <HI>King</HI> his <HI>Ma&s;ter, Mary Henrietta</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> Si|&s;ter to <HI>Louis</HI> XIII. of glorious Memory. I mean by this, that he came with &s;uch a &s;tately and magnificent Equipage, that the like had not been &s;een, of a long time, with an Amba&s;&s;ador. He had a permi&s;&s;ion to bring over with him &s;ome <HI>French-men,</HI> who had gone into <HI>England</HI> after the Revocation of the Edict of <HI>Nants,</HI> and who never dur&s;t have ventur'd to return afterwards without a Pa&s;s-port. However, <HI>Degrez,</HI> whom the Court had employ'd to take up <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> and other Per|&s;ons of that Religion, look'd upon this as a fa|vourable opportunity for him, and did not fail to make his advantage of it. It being his ordi|nary Cu&s;tom to render every Per&s;on &s;u&s;pected, in order to make the be&s;t of his Trade, he upon a certain Day took up one of the Amba&s;&s;ador's <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> while he thought of going to &s;ee one of his Friends, who was an <HI>Advocate.</HI> It was very happy for this <HI>Advocate,</HI> that he had been all along a Catholick, for that <HI>Quality,</HI> and his wi&s;e Conduct &s;helter'd him from the evil De&s;igns of this <HI>Kidnapper,</HI> who&s;e Gain it was to ca&s;t every one in Pri&s;on. He told him freely his Sentiments of &s;uch proceedings; for he had no Orders to do what he did then, but it was his ordinary pra|ctice, that he might be thought the more <HI>Zealous,</HI> though all his <HI>Zeal</HI> con&s;i&s;ted only in his Intere&s;t. The <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> ask'd him, what it was he accus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d him of; and why he made his Pri&s;oner after that manner, he being the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>England</HI>&punc;s
<PB N="241" REF="400">
Dome&s;tick, to whom only he was oblig'd to give an account of his Conduct. It was upon that &s;core that the Advocate exclaim'd again&s;t <HI>Degrez,</HI> making him to know, that the Court would never approve of &s;uch Proceedings. <HI>Degrez</HI> found him&s;elf oblig'd to an&s;wer all tho&s;e Demands, which the Advocate back'd with all the Arguments he could invent, telling him, That he engag'd him&s;elf, as well as the King, in an unwarrant|able Action. The Wound that the War had gi|ven to <HI>France</HI> was &s;till bleeding, and <HI>Degrez</HI> know|ing that all this Mi&s;chief was brought upon them by the Amba&s;&s;ador's <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> he thought he was oblig'd to give him &s;ome Rea&s;on for what he had done. He told him that the <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> had admini&s;tred the Sacrament to one of his Religion, and had &s;ent for him to that end to the Amba&s;|&s;ador's Hou&s;e, and that being forbid, it was very warrantable for him to take him up, as he did. And thus he was not afraid to declare him&s;elf Sacrilegious, the better to colour his De&s;ign. In effect 'tis true, that was prohibited; but 'tis as true that the Mini&s;ter was never guilty of it, and therefore de&s;ired to &s;ee the Per&s;on who ac|cus'd him. Now <HI>Degrez</HI> had brought a Fellow along with him to the Advocate's Door, who had indeavour'd to impo&s;e upon the Clergy-man. For this Ra&s;cal had pretended to be a Prote&s;tant, and apply'd him&s;elf to the Mini&s;ter to procure him a Pa&s;s-port for <HI>England.</HI> The Mini&s;ter was in effect impos'd upon. He believ'd him in good earne&s;t to be &s;ome poor Man, whom the Zeal for his Religion oblig'd to quit his Country and Friends; but knowing that was not permitted, he endeavour'd to comfort him, without giving him any other relief. But the Ra&s;cally Fellow had no mind to tell his Ma&s;ter that an&s;wer, or if he had, <HI>Degrez</HI> pleaded ignorance. However,
<PB N="242" REF="401">
the Mini&s;ter was &s;o exceedingly vex'd at this Calumny, that if his Character had allow'd him to meddle with any of them, he had doubtle&s;s bang'd the Villain to &s;ome purpo&s;e. But that being impracticable, he de&s;ir'd <HI>Degrez</HI> to cau&s;e ar|re&s;t him, and told him if he refus'd it, he mu&s;t be an&s;werable for it to my Lord <HI>Portland,</HI> and that the <HI>King</HI> their <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> was capable to do him|&s;elf Ju&s;tice, and he might come to hear of it in a &s;hort time. The Advocate added, That he might find it to his di&s;advantage. The&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions put the little Gentleman into a fright; he went to Mon|&s;ieur <HI>D'Argen&s;on,</HI> to know of him how to be|have in the matter. His Officers had always an eye upon the Mini&s;ter after that; but Mon&s;ieur <HI>D'Argen&s;on</HI> found that the Advocate had advis'd him well, and commanded him to put his advice in Execution. In fine, he was forc'd to &s;end his Man to Pri&s;on, and &s;et the Mini&s;ter at liberty, according to the Order that Mon&s;ieur <HI>D'Argen&s;on</HI> had given him. It's certain, this fal&s;e Witne&s;s de|&s;erv'd to be hang'd, or at lea&s;t to be &s;ent to the Gallies, to teach all tho&s;e of the like Kidney pru|dence upon their own expences. But as the wick'd find favour rather than hone&s;t Men, who&s;e mi&s;|fortune brings them into any inconveniency, they delay'd to proceed again&s;t him, until my Lord <HI>Portland</HI> was gone, and then they &s;et him at li|berty.</P>
<P>All the Court &s;how'd this <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador</HI> &s;ingular Marks of Honour. The <HI>Daup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ine,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and all the great Lords of the Court, invited him to Dinner, while he for his part kept a very &s;plendid Table. The Count of <HI>Auvergne</HI> younge&s;t Son to the Duke of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> gave him the u&s;e of his Lodgings while he &s;tay'd at <HI>Paris;</HI> and him&s;elf went in the mean time to <HI>Holland</HI> to
<PB N="243" REF="402">
his Wife's E&s;tate, who died there about that time. This <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador</HI> had at his Entry a hun|dred Livery-men, and &s;ix Coaches, three with eight Hor&s;es, and three with &s;ix; and continued the &s;ame Grandeur all the time he &s;tay'd at Court. He always made his Vi&s;its with all that Atten|dance, to let the World &s;ee how little he re&s;em|bled a great many of that Quality, who di&s;charge three parts of their Equipage the next day after their Entry; &s;o that he &s;pent almo&s;t a hundred thou&s;and Crowns in the two Months that his Em|ba&s;&s;y la&s;ted.</P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> pa&s;s'd his time very indifferently all that while. He heard from all hands the Ho|nour done to my Lord <HI>Portland,</HI> which was &s;uch as perhaps was never &s;hown before to any <HI>Am|ba&s;&s;ador.</HI> This made &s;ome People believe that there were &s;ome Alliances on foot betwixt the two Kings, and the more, becau&s;e my Lord <HI>Port|land</HI> had three or four Private Audiences of his <HI>Maje&s;ty.</HI> However, while &s;ome <HI>French</HI> People &s;u&s;pected, that they thought of dividing <HI>Flanders</HI> between them two, after the Death of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who&s;e Health was very infirm, it came to be known that the&s;e private Audiences were upon a very different Subject. My Lord <HI>Portland</HI> in&s;i&s;ted upon the removing of King <HI>James</HI> at a farther di&s;tance from the King's Pre&s;ence, promi|&s;ing in his Ma&s;ter's Name to give him and the <HI>Queen</HI> a Pen&s;ion &s;ufficient to excu&s;e his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> from the Expence he had been at upon that Prince, &s;ince he had made a Sanctuary of his Dominions. But the King would never give ear to it, which ex|ceeded King <HI>James</HI>'s Expectation, who, in ca&s;e the <HI>King</HI> had abandon'd him, was re&s;olv'd to retire to <HI>Avignion,</HI> for he began already to inform him|&s;elf,
<PB N="244" REF="403">
if he could live conveniently there. For as the King was oblig'd in Policy to make Peace with his Enemy, though he had promis'd ne|ver to make it, until he had re&s;tor'd him to his Crown, he was afraid that the &s;ame Policy might al&s;o induce him to grant what was de|manded.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Malady increa&s;ing every Moment, in&s;omuch, that it was generally thought he had few days to live, did not only move all the Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> to delay the Reform of their Troops after the Peace, but likewi&s;e retarded the Evacuation of &s;ome Places, which his Maje&s;ty was oblig'd to Surrender. However, the Marquis of <HI>Harcourt</HI> receiv'd Orders to go with all di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i|gence to the Court of <HI>Madrid</HI> with this <HI>In&s;truction,</HI> that if he &s;aw no probability, as in effect there was none, to bring the Succe&s;&s;ion of his Catho|lick Maje&s;ty to fall upon one of the <HI>Dauphine</HI>'s Sons; he &s;hould endeavour, at lea&s;t, to hinder its coming to any of his Imperial Maje&s;ty's Chil|dren. For it was to the Emperor and his De&s;cen|dants, that <HI>Philip</HI> IV. the pre&s;ent King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Father had left it by his Will. And the <HI>Emper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> becoming already very powerful by his Conque&s;ts in <HI>Hungary,</HI> he was thereby become &s;o &s;u&s;pected to his <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> that he was re&s;olv'd to have re|cour&s;e to his Arms, rather than &s;uffer it to fall into his Hands. And, accordingly, to fright the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he caus'd to file off Sixty thou&s;and Men to the Frontiers of <HI>Italy, Catalonia,</HI> and <HI>Na|varre.</HI> He was &s;en&s;ible that would add &s;ome weight to his Amba&s;&s;ador's Di&s;cour&s;es, and might al&s;o awaken the Ambition of &s;ome Grandee of the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="404">
The Marqui&s;s was no &s;ooner arriv'd in <HI>Spain</HI> than he apply'd him&s;elf to bu&s;ine&s;s. He told tho&s;e, who were capable to act in concert with him in an Affair of &s;uch importance, that <HI>Phi|lip</HI> IV. had gone beyond his Power, when he pretended to di&s;po&s;e of his Crown at plea&s;ure, again&s;t the Laws of Nature. That it belong'd lawfully to his Daughter's Children, and not to his Relations in the fourth Degree, who could pretend to no Right of them&s;elves. That the <HI>Dau|phine</HI> had three Sons, and the Duke of <HI>Burgun|dy</HI>'s &s;econd Brother was &s;till as pliable as wax, whom they could Mould into any Form they pleas'd, and if they would fix their Eye upon him, they might ea&s;ily breed him to their own Cu|&s;toms; that if this fail'd, the Prince of <HI>Bavaria</HI> being Grand &s;on to a Daughter of <HI>Spain,</HI> the King, his Ma&s;ter, would rather approve of his Election, than of the Emperor's, or of any of his Children, unle&s;s they had a mind to follow the Example of the <HI>Poles,</HI> who to oblige <HI>Strangers</HI> to agree among them&s;elves, had twice cho&s;en a So|vereign of their own Country. And this was all the King pretended to, con&s;idering he could not expect to bring the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> into his own Family. But the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> having a watchful Eye upon the Conduct of this Amba&s;&s;a|dor, who made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to renver&s;e her De&s;igns, pry'd narrowly into his Intrigues, and remov'd the King, her Husband, &s;ome di&s;tance from <HI>Madrid,</HI> under pretence that the Air was prejudicial to his Health. She carried him to <HI>To|ledo,</HI> and pretending it was only upon the account of his Health; would allow no body to follow him thither. Nay, &s;he left &s;ome Mini&s;ters that &s;he confided in at <HI>Madrid,</HI> in order to receive whatever any of the Amba&s;&s;adors had a mind to

offer. The Marquis <HI>de Harcourt</HI> &s;aw clearly with what view the Queen made this Journey, and that &s;he intended to be &s;o fully Mi&s;tri&s;s of the King, her Husband's Inclinations, that &s;he could obtain of him whatever &s;he had a mind to. He fear'd &s;he might prevail with him to confirm <HI>Philip</HI> IV's Will; and at the &s;ame time ob&s;erv'd, that the Count <HI>de H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rrach</HI> was no more to be &s;een at <HI>Ma|drid,</HI> and in all probability was gone to <HI>Toledo;</HI> upon this, he went immediately thither al&s;o, under pretence of having receiv'd a Memorial (which he forg'd) from the King his <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> with po&s;itive Orders to communicate it to his Catholick <HI>Ma|je&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> who did not in the lea&s;t expect it, was extreamly &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee him there; and caus'd the King, her Husband, to whom he pre&s;ented his <HI>Memorial,</HI> to acquaint him, That he had left the Cardinal of <HI>Corduba</HI> at <HI>Madrid</HI> on purpo&s;e, to whom he might have communicated his Memo|rials, as well as to him; that his principal Inten|tion for coming thither, was to recover his Health, and not to trouble him&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> with Bu&s;ine&s;s; and therefore he might apply him&s;elf to the <HI>Cardinal</HI> in all Affairs of <HI>State.</HI> However, con&s;idering that the Memorial was not very long, and that in all appearance it tended to his own advantage, he thought he was oblig'd to an&s;wer it him&s;elf. One thing to be con&s;ider'd, is, that the King of <HI>Morocco</HI> had for a long time be&s;ieg'd the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Ceuta</HI> in <HI>Barbary,</HI> which belong'd to his Catholick <HI>Ma|je&s;ty,</HI> but could never take it. Nor was the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in circum&s;tances to rai&s;e the Siege, though he had attempted it &s;everal times. In all appea|rance the&s;e <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> did not carry it on very vigorou&s;ly; whether they were ignorant how to

carry it on, or that they thought the <HI>Conquest</HI> the more Glorious after a Siege of &s;o many Years. His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> by this Memorial, of|fer'd to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> if he pleas'd, to &s;end Men of War and Gallies to &s;uccour that place.

But he was &s;o treache|rou&s;ly &s;erv'd by him, whom he had entru&s;ted with his Orders, that in&s;tead of executing them, he de&s;erted to the Enemies. Nay, he did much wor&s;e, for not being &s;atisfied to Renounce his Ma&s;ter only, he renounc'd al&s;o <HI>Je&s;us Christ,</HI> which was e&s;teem'd &s;o great an encouragement for the&s;e <HI>Infidels,</HI> that, after that, they thought they had gain'd all. Such an accident, in effect, con|founded all the Governors his <HI>Catholick Maje&s;ty</HI> had upon that Coa&s;t; and this was the Subject, or ra|ther the Pretence of the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador's Me|morial. But whether his Catholick Maje&s;ty had no mind to accept of &s;uch &s;u&s;pected Succours, or that he thought he could do without them, he thank'd the <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador</HI> for the proffer, ob&s;erving with him, at the &s;ame time, all the mea&s;ures of Civility, that were proper for the occa&s;ion. However, he who had renounc'd his <HI>King</HI> and his <HI>Faith,</HI> beginning to be &s;en&s;ible of his fault, and to repent of it, confe&s;s'd that he was a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and abhorr'd his <HI>Apo&s;tacy.</HI> But the <HI>Infidels,</HI> who had made a great deal of noi&s;e of his change, expecting to oblige him to return to them by the force of <HI>Pre&s;ents</HI> and <HI>Promi&s;es,</HI> indeavour'd to regain him; but &s;eeing him continue in his Re|pentance, and that there was no po&s;&s;ibility of bringing him over again to them, they threaten'd to treat him as they u&s;ually do <HI>Apo&s;tates</HI> from their <HI>Religion,</HI> I mean, they threaten'd to Empale
<PB N="248" REF="407">
him after torturing. But he expected no le&s;s, and was fully re&s;olv'd to undergo all, being extream glad to expiate by the&s;e Torments, the heinous Crime he had committed again&s;t his <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>King.</HI> So being no ways frighten'd by their Me|naces, he &s;ubmitted him&s;elf very freely to all the Torments they could invent. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ine, in the mid|dle of the&s;e di&s;mal Torments, he joyfully confe&s;s'd him whom he had denied: upon which they put him at la&s;t to Death, lea&s;t by his Con&s;tancy &s;ome among&s;t them might be mov'd to acknow|ledge, that he &s;uffer'd for a good Cau&s;e, in regard he &s;eem'd &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of Pain in his Tor|ments.</P>
<P>After this An&s;wer, the Marquis of <HI>Harcourt</HI> was obliged to return to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and endea|vour'd by all means po&s;&s;ible to gain the People by a very agreeable Conduct; his Wife, the <HI>Mar|chione&s;s,</HI> came al&s;o from <HI>France</HI> to &s;econd him. For having an infinite deal of Wit, &s;he thought to infinuate her &s;elf by degrees into the Queen's Affection, and gain her Confidence by the means of &s;ome Propo&s;als &s;he believ'd would prove mightily to her Advantage, with regard to her Per&s;on. It was highly pre&s;umptuous in her to entertain that thought. To be &s;ure, her <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> would be much upon her guard again&s;t her; for be&s;ides her being the Wife of a <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">narch,</HI> who is a capital Enemy to <HI>France,</HI> there was not the lea&s;t appearance &s;he would hearken to any thing that came from that <HI>Nation.</HI> The Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> notwith&s;tanding her being a <HI>German,</HI> began to conform her &s;elf to a Court, where Trick and Policy are in Vogue as much as in any in the Univer&s;e, and therefore &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gn'd pre&s;ently to be exceedingly charm'd with the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> to the

The <HI>Marchione&s;s</HI> told it to her Husband, meaning to per&s;wade him to rejoyce at it with her: But the Amba&s;&s;ador, though he had always been a Man more inclin'd to the Sword than the Court, was yet cunning, and advis'd her always to &s;u&s;pect &s;o exce&s;&s;ive Civility. He told her, it was not natural for the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s <HI>Wife,</HI> to be &s;o early in a good Corre&s;pondence with the Am|ba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France</HI>'s Lady, that it look'd like a Trick among tho&s;e who knew better than to judge of things by appearance. And therefore all he re|commended to her, was to be prudent, that &s;he ought to hear the <HI>Queen</HI> &s;peak, rather than &s;peak her &s;elf, and by the&s;e means &s;he would cer|tainly advance her Affairs much better than by endeavouring to be the Head of the Conver&s;a|tion.</P>
<P>While the&s;e <HI>Intrigues</HI> proceeded after this manner, the Prince&s;s of <HI>Conti,</HI> the King's Daughter, had &s;ome thoughts of marrying Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Me|lan,</HI> elde&s;t Daughter to the Prince&s;s of <HI>Epinoi,</HI> to the Marqui&s;s of <HI>La Valiere,</HI> her Cou&s;in-German; &s;he had a great Re&s;pect for her, and went very often to <HI>Paris</HI> to &s;ee her; and as for the Marquis, he was in very good terms with the <HI>Dauphine.</HI> She had it in her view, at the &s;ame time, to get him made <HI>Duke</HI> and <HI>Peer,</HI> by obtaining from the <HI>King</HI> the <HI>Title</HI> of his <HI>Dutchy</HI> of <HI>Vaujour</HI> to her &s;elf, in expectation of his &s;ucceeding to the Propriety of it after her Death.

It co&s;t him only a hundred thou&s;and Crowns, though there was as much Wood upon it as would an&s;wer that Mo|ney, which he &s;old in a &s;hort time after the Purcha&s;e. However, Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Melan</HI> flat|ter'd her &s;elf already with being a Dutche&s;s very &s;oon, which was &s;omewhat better than the ima|ginary Principality her Family flatter'd them&s;elves with, when the Prince&s;s of <HI>Conti</HI> came to know that his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> had no Inclination for that Marriage. This made her &s;hift &s;ides, and &s;eeing the Duke of <HI>Noailles</HI> was in great Favour with the King, &s;he ca&s;t her Eyes upon one of his Daughters. There was a whole Regiment of them; and though there had been three of them already married, yet there remain'd &s;till &s;uch a number of them, that he was the Per|&s;on in all the Court, the be&s;t provided with Means to make Sons-in-law; be&s;ides, they &s;trove who &s;hould have them.

I &s;ay, &s;he
<PB N="251" REF="410">
thought that her Father was in no Capacity to do any thing for her, and therefore by her care &s;he made her a very well-accompli&s;h'd young Lady, and this Quality, with all the others, which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in an eminent de|gree, made her the de&s;irable Object of all the <HI>Great Men</HI> of the Court, who had any Sons to Marry; but there were particularly two, who had a great de&s;ign upon her, namely, the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut,</HI> who would have given her the Prince of <HI>Mar&s;illac,</HI> his Grand-Son; the other, the Duke of <HI>Noailles,</HI> who had his elde&s;t Son, the Count of <HI>Ayen,</HI> to Marry. Either of the&s;e &s;eem'd very advantageous for her, though the fir&s;t appear'd to be much more &s;uch than the la&s;t. For in effect, though the Hou&s;e of <HI>Noailles</HI> be very good and ancient, yet the Family of <HI>Rochefoucaut</HI> exceeds it; at lea&s;t in the Opinion of a great many, for all who pretend to know any thing of the <HI>Grandeur</HI> of <HI>Families,</HI> make a great difference between them; be&s;ides, though the Duke of <HI>Noailles</HI> was Captain of the Life-Guards, a very con&s;iderable Po&s;t, the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut</HI> had two others, which were fully as con&s;iderable, and both of them carry great <HI>Titles,</HI> which di&s;tingui&s;h them from many others; though in effect, that of <HI>Great Mar&s;hal</HI> of the Lodgings is &s;mall enough for its Grandeur. On the other hand, there are a great many larger E&s;tates in his Family, than the Duke of <HI>Noailles</HI> can pretend to.

He gave him the Survivance of the Government of <HI>Rou&s;&s;illon,</HI> which the Duke of <HI>Noailles</HI> had; that of the Government of <HI>Berry,</HI> which the Count of <HI>Aubignie</HI> had; a hundred thou&s;and Livres in Jewels to the young Lady; and in fine, a great many other things, that &s;how'd no le&s;s the Magnificence of the <HI>King,</HI> than the particular Friend&s;hip he had for their Relations.

Dutchy by the Contract of Marriage, and the Affair being thus concluded, the <HI>Dauphine</HI> con|ceiv'd &s;o great a Friend&s;hip for the new marri|ed Gentleman, that he could go no where with|out him. He had him always by his &s;ide in his Coach, as if they had but one Coach betwixt them both, and lean'd his Head always to his, as if he had been his Mi&s;tri&s;s, and in a &s;porting way call'd him <HI>Violet,</HI> a Name that formerly was not much coveted, being only proper for Foot|men, or that &s;ort of Cattel, but now became very fa&s;hionable among&s;t the Courtiers. The <HI>Dauphine</HI> is naturally of a &s;weet Temper, and an Enemy to all manner of Con&s;traint. He is not capable of having any great Inclination for Women; and though he may have lov'd one or two of them, knowing that the fair Sex requires complai&s;ance, he did not regard them &s;o much upon the account of their ea&s;i|ne&s;s as of their Virtue. <HI>Dumont,</HI> one of his Ma&s;ters of the Hor&s;e, who was much in his Favour, brought them always to him by Private Stairs when he wanted them, and &s;ent them immediately back when he had done. This <HI>Prince</HI> chus'd them ordinarily among&s;t the Actre&s;&s;es of the Opera or Comedy, upon which there happen'd to him a very plea&s;ant Rencounter, that de&s;erves &s;ome place in this Work. Having caus'd <HI>Dumont</HI> to &s;peak to one of the Actre&s;&s;es of the Opera, he agreed with her that &s;he &s;hould come to <HI>Meudon,</HI> to the end he might introduce her to the <HI>Dauphin</HI>'s Clo&s;et by the private Stairs; they conde&s;cended upon the Day and Hour. The <HI>Actre&s;s,</HI> though a Per&s;on void of Ceremony, thought it not very decent to go thither alone, and &s;o brought one of her Si&s;ters along with her. The <HI>Dau|phine</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="413">
had &s;ome Per&s;on with him in his Clo&s;et when they arriv'd, which oblig'd <HI>Dumont</HI> to tell them to wait in a place where he po&s;ted them near the Clo&s;et; at the &s;ame time he made it known to the <HI>Dauphine</HI> by a &s;ign, that his fair Lady was come, to the end he might di&s;charge his Company. The <HI>Dauphine</HI> order'd him to go &s;ome where or other, and in the mean time the <HI>Dauphine</HI>'s Company judg|ing they where &s;omewhat inconvenient to him, took there leave. <HI>Dumont</HI> having left the private Door half open, the Actre&s;s's Si&s;ter hearing no noi&s;e in the Room, had the Curio&s;ity to look into it. The <HI>Dauphine,</HI> who only waited for <HI>Dumont</HI>'s return to have her Si&s;ter introduc'd, having his Eyes fixt, by chance, that way, where the other was looking, no &s;ooner &s;aw a Wo|man's Coiffe at the Door, but taking her to be the Per&s;on he had a mind to, he de&s;ir'd her to come in. She thought it good manners to obey, though it was none of her he meant. But whether his Eyes were &s;omewhat Dim that Day, or that he was in &s;uch ha&s;te, that he had no time to con&s;ider her aright, he gave her the &s;ame u&s;age he de&s;ign'd for her Si&s;ter. After which, having no further Inclination for the Lady's Conver&s;ation, he &s;ent her away imme|diately. She told her Si&s;ter nothing of this Ad|venture. The Actre&s;s &s;till waited for <HI>Dumont,</HI> and long'd much for his coming. In fine, he return'd by the Private Stairs, and told her he was a going to &s;peak to the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> in order to bring her in. The <HI>Dauphine</HI> told him, <HI>The he had had all the Conver&s;ation with her he intended, and de|&s;ir'd him to give her five hundred</HI> Louis d'ores, <HI>and &s;end her home. Dumont,</HI> who had &s;een her very impatient to enter, knew nothing of what he
<PB N="255" REF="414">
meant by that, and intreated the <HI>Dauphine</HI> to ex|plain him&s;elf. In fine, he came to know what pa&s;s'd, but not knowing with whom, he went and told the <HI>Actre&s;s,</HI> that if her Appetite was &s;o very good, it was not the &s;ame with the <HI>Dauphine</HI>'s. She was extreamly &s;urpriz'd at his Complement; but under&s;tood by it, that her Si&s;ter had deceiv'd her, and was &s;o extreamly vext at it, that &s;he would never be reconcil'd with her, till &s;he conde&s;cended to divide the five hundred <HI>Louis d'ores</HI> with her, which the <HI>Dauphine</HI> had &s;ent to her.</P>
<P>The furious War which the <HI>King</HI> had main|tain'd again&s;t &s;o many Potentates, had encou|rag'd &s;ome of the new Converts to profe&s;s their former Religion, notwith&s;tanding the Pro|hibition to the contrary. His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> caus'd to take up a great many of them in the Neighbour|hood of <HI>Orange,</HI> as they were returning thence from Sermon. Some of them were treated very &s;everely, while others got off for a Month or two's Impri&s;onment. The <HI>King</HI> &s;et al&s;o Guards upon all the Avenues of that Town, to hinder them from returning thither any more. But not being intirely &s;atisfied with this Precaution, he made very &s;trict Edicts again&s;t all &s;uch, who &s;hould dare, in prejudice of the Prohibition, to venture to go thither again. But this was not the only di&s;obedience that appear'd in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, for not one of them went to Ma&s;s. And his Maje&s;ty being inform'd of it from all Parts, and finding it a matter that ought to be remedied, if he meant to prevent &s;ome danger|ous Accidents, deliberated with his Council, how he ought to proceed again&s;t the&s;e ob&s;tinate Peo|ple. They were all at a lo&s;s how to advi&s;e him
<PB N="256" REF="415">
upon that occa&s;ion, in&s;omuch, that the Affair re|mained undecided, and the King wrote to the mo&s;t part of the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Intendants,</HI> to have their Judgment in writing: The&s;e differ'd in their Sentiments from one another. Some advis'd him to make u&s;e only of Exhortations, in order to make them Obedient; others were for a &s;evere u&s;age. Tho&s;e, who were of this la&s;t Sentiment, were &s;o much the more warm in it, becau&s;e they imagin'd (though unju&s;tly) that the King of <HI>England</HI> had us'd the&s;e means with regard to the Catholicks of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who not willing to &s;ubmit to the pre&s;ent Government, were fain to look for a Sanctuary in <HI>France,</HI> to &s;helter them&s;elves from the Puni&s;hment that was due to their Rebellion. The&s;e People of all Ages and Conditions, coming over in whole Troops to <HI>France,</HI> never fail'd to &s;pread abroad, that they had been oblig'd to quit their Country in order to avoid the Vio|lence that was done to their <HI>Con&s;ciences.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> gave them five hundred Pi&s;tols in <HI>Charity,</HI> which was thought but a &s;mall mite for &s;o great a <HI>King.</HI> However he appointed &s;ome Ladies of the Court to rai&s;e an Offering for them among&s;t the Per&s;ons of <HI>Quality.</HI> The Curats of <HI>Paris</HI> fol|low'd that Example, and caus'd al&s;o an Offer|ing to be made in their Pari&s;hes to &s;upply their Nece&s;&s;ity.

In the mean time the Earl of <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> Brother in Law to the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> was Named by the King of <HI>England,</HI> to &s;ucceed this la&s;t in <HI>France:</HI> The King had no mind to &s;peak to my Lord <HI>Portland,</HI> of any thing that pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Ireland,</HI> lea&s;t he might thence take occa&s;ion to &s;peak to him of the Prote&s;tants in <HI>France.</HI> He made him a pre&s;ent of his Picture, richly &s;et with Diamonds, according to the ordinary Practice of this Court, with a regard to all Emba&s;&s;adours.</P>
<P>But there was this difference made betwixt him and others; that the Diamonds upon the Pre&s;ent made to him, were Three times more rich than they upon any others: The King probably meant, that his pre&s;ent &s;hould bear &s;ome proportion to the expences he had been at; or perhaps knowing he was in good terms with his Ma&s;ter, he was glad to have his favour upon occa&s;ion. Some few Days before his departure, the King made a review of his Hou|&s;hold; and King <HI>James</HI> was there, as was al&s;o this <HI>Lord,</HI> who perhaps had forborn coming, if he had known that the other was to be there. The <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Wales</HI> came thither al&s;o, and had particular Or|ders from the King his Father, to joyn Conver&s;a|tion with that <HI>Lord</HI>'s Son, to whom he had cau&s;ed to in&s;inuate before, that he never pretended to make him an&s;werable for what his Ma&s;ter had done a|gain&s;t him. This young Prince being only a Child, was hardly capable of &s;uch an Entertainment, but he had placed &s;uch Per&s;ons about him, as were able to inform him, and even continue the Di&s;cour&s;e if nece&s;&s;ary: I do not know what he meant by it: However my Lord <HI>Portland</HI> knowing the young Princes de&s;ign, &s;ent to tell his Son to avoid him, and him&s;elf &s;hun'd all tho&s;e of King <HI>James</HI>'s Court. The review being over, he left <HI>France</HI> in a few Days after, leaving a great e&s;teem for him among&s;t all the Courtiers. However before he went, he was to &s;ee all the King's Hou&s;es in the Neighbourhood
<PB N="258" REF="417">
of <HI>Paris,</HI> and found them of a far different magnifi|cence from his Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;es in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Eng|land.</HI> He went to <HI>Chantilly</HI> in his roade, whither the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Conde</HI> went a purpo&s;e to entertain him; and thus here turned home, extreamly &s;atisfied with the Honour done him every where, and gave an Account to his Ma&s;ter of all that pa&s;&s;ed in his Em|ba&s;&s;ie. This Prince was not ill pleas'd, at the News of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s &s;ickne&s;s; for it being upon that account that <HI>France</HI> continued &s;till Arm'd, he likewi&s;e kept up his Troops, &s;o as that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could not find fault with it: He knew his <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Safety,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted in the Number of his Troops; and having Enemies both within and without his Kingdom, there was nothing more capable to gain him re&s;pect, than to have always a good Army at his Command.</P>
<P>This Prince having made it to appear upon all occa&s;ions, that he had an infinite deal of Sen&s;e, was not in the lea&s;t mi&s;taken upon this occa&s;ion: For finding it his intere&s;t upon two Accounts, to keep <HI>France</HI> continually in Arms; both as it was a means to exhau&s;t his Forces; and as it wou'd prove always a good pretence for him to keep up his own Army: He advis'd to have it ratified at the <HI>Dyet of Ratisbon,</HI> that the Princes of the <HI>Empire,</HI> &s;hould always keep up a Hundred and Twenty Thou&s;and Men in Arms, in the time of Peace; for he was &s;en&s;ible, the more they had, the more <HI>France</HI> wou'd be obliged to have on that &s;ide. And there being but a &s;mall di&s;tance betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> he wou'd by tho&s;e means be always upon his Guard. It was al&s;o believed, that in Po|licy he asked of the King, to remove <HI>King James and his Wife</HI> at a di&s;tance from him, though he doubted the King would never con&s;ent to it. But it would be &s;uch a pretence for him to &s;how the <HI>Parliament,</HI> that having a con&s;iderable Enemy &s;o nigh him; prudence would oblige him to keep
<PB N="259" REF="418">
him&s;elf always in a condition to re&s;i&s;t him in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>But whether he meant to enlarge upon that, or that in effect, <HI>King James</HI> who had attempted &s;e|veral times to remount his <HI>Throne,</HI> by fomenting in&s;urrections in <HI>England,</HI> began to attempt the &s;ame again, or whatever el&s;e was in it, he caus'd a great many Per&s;ons to be taken up; and a|mong others the Earl of <HI>Clancarty,</HI> as if he had meant to rai&s;e new troubles. The Earl had been Captain of the Guards to <HI>King James,</HI> and had pa&s;&s;ed once more before into that Country, in Order to do him Service. But he had no &s;uch de&s;ign at this time; He had only went thither under the benefit of the Peace, though the New King had excluded him from it, as he had done a great many others, who had continued after a cer|tain time in the Service of his Enemy. However this Earl being a Per&s;on of quality; his Impri&s;on|ment made no little noi&s;e, for in&s;tead of &s;ending him to the Tower, they put him up in Newgate. This was by no means di&s;agreeable to the <HI>King,</HI> for the more the <HI>Pri&s;oner</HI> was a Man of <HI>quality;</HI> the greater Impre&s;&s;ion his return into the Coun|try, made upon the minds of the People, for they knew he was guilty the la&s;t time he came into the <HI>Kingdom;</HI> becau&s;e he had made his E&s;cape out of the Tower. For at that time he propo&s;ed to a <HI>Lady</HI> of quality, who came to &s;ee him, to allow him to make his e&s;cape under her Petticoats. This Lady being as large as he was little, con|de&s;cended very willingly at the Peril of whatever could happen: For be&s;ides the apprehen&s;ion &s;he was under, of being catch'd in the Commi&s;&s;ion of a flaming Crime, and being kept Pri&s;oner her &s;elf, &s;he allowed his approaches to a place, with which the <HI>Ladies</HI> hardly &s;uffer &s;uch near commu|nication, at lea&s;t without &s;ome &s;cruple; what|ever was in it he played his Game &s;o well, that
<PB N="260" REF="419">
he made his e&s;cape without being di&s;covered, and from that time kept always about King <HI>James,</HI> till the time of his being retaken, that I mentioned but now.</P>
<P>It was a long time before the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could be &s;en|&s;ible of any pretence their King had, to keep any Troops on Foot, in the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of the Af|fairs of <HI>Europe</HI> in General, or of their own in Parti|cular. On the other Hard, it was given out a pretty while before that His Chri&s;tian <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> was to have a Camp near <HI>Campiegne,</HI> where the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> was to Command. And though it was &s;aid publickly, it was de&s;igned only to let him &s;ee &s;omething in warlike affairs, and to accu&s;tom him by degrees to &s;uch great things as were due to his Birth, yet it bred &s;ome Jealou&s;ie, &s;o that the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> continued &s;till quiet. But the Natural re&s;tle&s;&s;|ne&s;s of that <HI>Nation,</HI> never allows them to be long at ea&s;e: In fine, they complained that being exhau&s;ted by the War, it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to continue the &s;ame expences in the time of Peace. The <HI>King</HI> of <HI>England</HI> thinking to &s;atisfie them in &s;ome degree, made a reform of &s;ome Regiments, and of o|thers, he &s;ent &s;ome into <HI>Holland,</HI> and &s;ome into <HI>Ireland,</HI> believing that the&s;e being once out of their &s;ight, they would be apt to forget them; but they &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon their former complaints. And to &s;peak the truth, they had good politick Rea|&s;ons to do what they did, not only with regard to them&s;elves, but al&s;o with regard to all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the Encampment which the King intended, was put off to <HI>September,</HI> to the end that the People in the Neighbourhood, might have opportunity to make their Harve&s;t, and gather in all their Corn; &s;o in this interval of time, there fell out &s;ome remarkable things at Court. One of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, which per|haps has no parallel in this Age, was as follows.
<PB N="261" REF="420">
<HI>Mon&s;ieur de Pelletier,</HI> who had been <HI>Controler Ge|neral</HI> of the <HI>Finances,</HI> and whom the King had made an <HI>Officer</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> quitted a Hundred Thou|&s;and Livers a Year, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the King's liberality, to be freed from all manner of bu&s;ine&s;s, and have time to mind his Salvation. His <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> had a mind to allow him &s;ome Pen&s;ion, and was &s;o much the more earne&s;t to do it, be|cau&s;e he cou'd never &s;ufficiently admire &s;uch a re&s;olution; but after all his remon&s;trances, he on|ly prevailed &s;o far, as to oblige him to accept of Twenty Thou&s;and Livers a Year, to maintain a Table for his Family. His place in the <HI>Po&s;t-hou&s;e,</HI> which was valued at Two and Thirty Thou&s;and Livers a Year, was given to <HI>Mon&s;ieur Pomponne:</HI> Who, however Pious he was thought to be, thought &s;uch a Po&s;t not incon&s;i&s;tent with his Devotion. <HI>Mon&s;ieur Pelletier</HI> retir'd immediately to his <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> of <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lle Neuf,</HI> within Three or Four Leagues of <HI>Paris;</HI> and di&s;carded the mo&s;t part of his Dome&s;ticks. His Brother who was <HI>Intendant</HI> of the <HI>Finances,</HI> being angry that he had not Named him to his Ma|je&s;ty for <HI>Comptrouler General</HI> of the <HI>Finances,</HI> when he quited it, was exceedingly vexed, becau&s;e he had not acquainted him with his Intention, in order to fall upon mea&s;ures, to make &s;ome advantage of his &s;poil.</P>
<P>Moreover he went the next Day to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and told the King (without waiting in the lea&s;t for what his Maje&s;ty had a mind to &s;ay upon the Sub|ject,) that though it was generally &s;aid in the World, that the <HI>Younger</HI> ought to follow the exam|ple of the <HI>Elder;</HI> yet he would take care not to imitate his Brother; that in effect he was &s;o far from believing, that his <HI>Maje&s;tie's</HI> Service cou'd in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;t hurt his Salvation, that on the contrary there was nothing more u&s;eful either for this World, or the World to come: So that his Maje&s;ty might, when he thought fit, load him with more bu&s;ine&s;s, with|out

giving him the lea&s;t di&s;turbance; that he would always continue in his ordinary road, without ever thinking of &s;huting him&s;elf up, either in a <HI>Cloy&s;ter, or a Country Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>He was ea&s;ily believed without &s;wearing, for every Body was &s;en&s;ible, how little inclination he had to quit the World. Be&s;ides, the World knew that he was not a Man, who troubled him&s;elf very much with bu&s;ine&s;s; he never lov'd to overcharge him&s;elf, for of whatever Con&s;equence the Affair was, his Buildings and Garden were fir&s;t look'd af|ter: Not but that he had a great deal of Sen&s;e, and in that even exceeded his Elde&s;t Brother; but be|ing of their Judgment who believe, that <HI>Charitie begins as home,</HI> he never car'd to bely a Maxim, which <HI>time</HI> and <HI>cu&s;tom</HI> had &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the World.</P>
<P>While both the Court and King admired <HI>Mon|&s;ieur Pelletiers</HI> Conduct: There fell out an accident betwixt two Courtiers at <HI>Marli,</HI> that had proved of a more trouble&s;om con&s;equence, if it had not been moderated by the <HI>By&s;tanders</HI> The matter was this, <HI>the Count of Auvergne</HI> was playing at <HI>Omber,</HI> with &s;ome other Lords, and <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Lau&s;un</HI> looki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">g over them, began to utter a great many &s;illy expre&s;&s;ions which vex'd the <HI>Count,</HI> in&s;omuch that he threw down his Cards. The Gam|&s;ters asked him what he meant; the <HI>Count</HI> an|&s;wered, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to play while he heard Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lau&s;un</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">edious Di&s;cour&s;e, and as for him he could not have the complai&s;ance to reli&s;h it. <HI>Mon&s;ieur Lau&s;un</HI> being always &s;en&s;ible of the honour he had in marrying <HI>Henry</HI> IV. his Grandchild, and upon that Account re&s;pecting very little &s;uch digrities, which had no better Foundation, than the <HI>Count</HI>'s, was &s;omething mov'd at the&s;e words, and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">de him a har&s;h an&s;wer. The Gentlemen who were pre&s;ent, asked them what they meant
<PB N="263" REF="422">
by quarrelling in that Place, and being Friends to both Parties, pre&s;ently put a &s;top to the Quarrel.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, Two more Con&s;iderable Per|&s;ons happened to quarrel; I mean the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> and the Chevalier of <HI>Vendome,</HI> Grand <HI>Prior</HI> of <HI>France.</HI> They were al&s;o playing at <HI>Omher,</HI> and the Grand <HI>Prior</HI> having call'd <HI>Gano,</HI> at the third Lift, and gain|ing <HI>Codille;</HI> the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> told the Per&s;on who had made him <HI>Gano,</HI> that he was too &s;imple to believe him, he being a Man that took his Advantage, where he could find it; and that he had never &s;een him play, after any other manner. The <HI>Grand Prior</HI> took notice of that Word, and &s;aid it was very re|proachful, under a dubious &s;en&s;e. The Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> took no notice of what he had an&s;wered, whe|ther he meant to &s;hew him&s;elf &s;omewhat wi&s;er than the other, or that he thought the Terms he made u&s;e of, obliged him to make that An&s;wer. But after the <HI>Game</HI> was ended, the Chevalier of <HI>Vendome</HI> went to <HI>Paris,</HI> and returned the next day to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> with a long Rapier by his Side. The <HI>Courtiers</HI> ask'd one another, whom he had a De&s;ign upon, in carrying that Rapier. No body dreamt of what had pa&s;&s;ed the Night before, betwixt him and the Prince of <HI>Conti;</HI> and the rather, becau&s;e there were hardly Two Per|&s;ons, le&s;s capable of counteracting the King's Orders. However, the <HI>Grand Prior</HI> having po&s;ted him&s;elf, where the Prince was to pa&s;s along, no &s;ooner &s;aw him, than he drew upon him, telling him, he mu&s;t needs remember, what he had &s;aid the Night before, and as the&s;e things were not to be &s;uffered, by Peo|ple of their Circum&s;tances, &s;o he had a mind to &s;ee him with Sword in hand. The <HI>Grand Prior</HI> meant by the&s;e Words, to put him&s;elf in Competition with him, which di&s;plea&s;ed the Prince exceedingly, in&s;omuch, that he told him, he had forgot him&s;elf, to &s;peak to him after that manner. The Duke of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> was coming along in the mean time, and the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> calling him, told him that he was equally con|cerned
<PB N="264" REF="423">
with him in the Affair, the Chevalier having &s;aid, that there was no difference, betwixt him and the Princes of the <HI>Blood,</HI> &s;o he de&s;ired to know his O|pinion of it, and if he thought fit to &s;uffer it. The Duke acquainted the Dauphin with it, and the Dau|phin immediately informed the King. Upon which his Maje&s;ty gave Orders to <HI>Mr. Pontchartrain,</HI> to &s;end the <HI>Grand Prior</HI> to the <HI>Ba&s;tille</HI> The <HI>Grand Prior</HI> de|&s;ired to be admitted to the King, to acquaint him, with his Rea&s;ons, but his Maje&s;ty had no mind to hear him; and ordered his <HI>&V;&s;hers</HI> to &s;hut the Cham|ber Door again&s;t him, in&s;omuch that this Prince, was at la&s;t obliged to obey, and went of his own ac|cord to Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>At that time, there was no Governour of the <HI>Ba|&s;tille;</HI> for <HI>Mr. de Be&s;ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">x,</HI> who had been Governour Forty Years at lea&s;t, was dead Six or Seven Months; and his Maje&s;ty had not yet nam'd any for that Go|vernment: Not but that there were Per&s;ons enough who &s;ollicited for it, for the va&s;t Riches which the late Governour had made by it, was a &s;ufficient Motive for a great many. The Governour of <HI>Pigner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l,</HI> be|ing at that time without Employ, that Place being given up by the Peace, &s;ollicited earne&s;tly for it. He had al&s;o a great many Competitors; for even the Duke of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ine</HI> had a mind to it: For that Ca&s;tle, being joined to the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> he would have been ve|ry glad to unite the <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rge</HI> of it, to that of Great <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> of the <HI>Artillery,</HI> as it was in the time of the Duke of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">liy.</HI> The <HI>Marquis</HI> of <HI>Sanveri, &V;nder Go|vernour</HI> of the <HI>young Princes</HI> and the late <HI>Governour</HI> s Son in Law, had al&s;o an Eye upon it, but upon Con|dition that he &s;hould not be obliged to re&s;ide there, and might have a fixt <HI>Sallary,</HI> as other Governments had. But this was quite contrary to his <HI>Father in law</HI> his Practice, who always thought the Advantage he made by the Pri&s;oners, more preferable a Thou&s;and times, than what the King had given other Gover|nours. But whether his Son in Law con&s;idered that

But <HI>Mr. Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> propo|&s;ed to the <HI>King, Mr. de Cinqmars,</HI> Governour of the <HI>I&s;lands</HI> of St. <HI>Honorat</HI> and St. <HI>Marguerite,</HI> and his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> &s;eeming to have &s;ome inclination for him, de&s;ired <HI>Barbe&s;ieux</HI> to write to him, that he might have that Government in&s;tead of his own, if he inclined to change.</P>
<P><HI>St. Mars</HI> was very old, and having pa&s;&s;ed his younger Days, in the Service of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> he had made a prodigious Fortune; for he was cho|&s;en by the King, to guard Mr. <HI>Fonq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">et</HI> and <HI>Mr. Lan|&s;un;</HI> &s;o that by the&s;e means, he was become extream|ly rich, and be&s;ides he was far from being covetous, as <HI>Mr. Be&s;maux</HI> was: Upon that account, he return'd an|&s;wer to the <HI>Marquis</HI> of <HI>Barbe&s;ieux,</HI> that he had no In|clination to change, if his Maje&s;ty plea&s;ed to conti|nue him where he was. But this <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> being very de&s;irous to have that Government in the Hands of a Per&s;on devoted to his Family, as Mr. <HI>St. Mars</HI> ought
<PB N="266" REF="425">
to be, becau&s;e he was obliged to his Father for his Fortune, had no mind to be &s;atisfied with this An&s;wer, but wrote again to him upon the &s;ame Subject, &s;etting forth that he neglected his own good Fortune; and be&s;ides, might have the Advantage to be near his Family, which he ought to regard as a &s;ingular Hap|pine&s;s, having been ab&s;ent from it for many Years. Mr. <HI>St. Mars</HI> was born in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Paris,</HI> moreover, he was married to Madam <HI>Frenoy</HI>'s Si&s;ter, which had contributed above all to his E&s;tabli&s;hment. This was therefore the way to attack him, upon his weak &s;ide. However it be, he took this Letter to be a kind of Command; and therefore made An&s;wer, that he would obey it. As &s;oon as <HI>Mr. Saumery</HI> knew this, he ask'd that Government of the King, which his Maje&s;ty granted to him; but in a few days after, he broke a Company that had been rai&s;ed on purpo&s;e, for Mr. <HI>Cinqmars,</HI> when he guarded Mr. <HI>Fouquet;</HI> and which he had ever &s;ince along with him in the <HI>I&s;lands</HI> of St. <HI>Honorat</HI> and St. <HI>Marguerite.</HI> The Cap|tain had a Sallary of Two Thou&s;and Crowns, be&s;ides his Profits; &s;o that Mr. <HI>Saumery</HI> lo&s;t all on a &s;udden, the half of the Gratification he thought to receive. In the mean time the Chevalier of <HI>Vendome</HI> was come to the <HI>Ba&s;tille,</HI> whither very few Lords went to &s;ee him, for fear of di&s;plea&s;ing his Maje&s;ty, who had &s;o re&s;ented his Conduct. Some were al&s;o unwilling to go, fearing the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Di&s;plea&s;ure, and in effect, the Prince checked Mr. <HI>d' Alegre,</HI> for having gone thither. Mr. <HI>d' Alegre</HI> an&s;wered, that he did not believe that his Highnes would have took it ill, but &s;ince he knew his mind, he would for the future avoid di&s;plea&s;ing him. The Prince accepted of his Excu&s;e, and the Mar&s;hals of <HI>Catinat</HI> and <HI>Tourville,</HI> having al&s;o gone thither, they thought to make the &s;ame Apology, but the Prince &s;aying nothing to them, it pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Vendome</HI> was at <HI>Anet,</HI> when his Bro|ther was commanded to Pri&s;on, but as &s;oon as he
<PB N="267" REF="426">
heard it, he took Po&s;t to be inform'd by him of the Af|fair, and after he had learn'd it, he thought the be&s;t way to obtain his Freedom was, by the Intere&s;t of the &s;ame Per&s;on, who had got him confin'd: he there|fore went immediately to wait upon the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> to that purpo&s;e. And this being all the Satisfa|ction the Prince demanded, he went him&s;elf to the <HI>King,</HI> to ask the <HI>Grand Prior</HI>'s Liberty. The King made him an&s;wer, that if he was &s;atisfied, yet him|&s;elf was not; &s;o that Eight or Ten Days were gone, before his Maje&s;ty would pardon that Prince. At la&s;t, his Maje&s;ty was prevailed upon, by the Solici|tations of the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Ven|dome.</HI> The Duke him&s;elf carried the Order for his Liberty, and brought him along with him to a cer|tain Place, where Four or Five Per&s;ons were drunk, in &s;olemnizing their Joy for the <HI>Grand Prior</HI>'s Liberty.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>Marquis</HI> and <HI>Marchione&s;&s;e</HI> of <HI>Mont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hevreuil,</HI> &s;ent al&s;o one of their Sons into that Pri&s;on, not becau&s;e he intended to fight, like the <HI>Grand Prior,</HI> but rather upon the account of a Re|port was &s;pread abroad of his being married at <HI>Ro|chelle,</HI> whither they had &s;ent to apprehend him. They re&s;olved to &s;end him to the <HI>American</HI> I&s;lands, in or|der to make him forget his Amours. The King was preparing a Fleet to be &s;ent into the&s;e Countries: and <HI>de Gennes</HI> Captain of a Man of War, a man very well known among&s;t the Sea Officers, was to com|mand it. It was thought, the <HI>Court</HI> de&s;igned to &s;eize an I&s;land in tho&s;e Parts, the Inhabitants of which had driven the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the greate&s;t Part of it, in&s;omuch that they were forced to retire to a &s;mall Corner of it. It was thither that the Father and Mo|ther intended to &s;end their Son, in order to do Pen|nance for his too warm Amours, as if Love had been a Capital Crime. But this Fleet giving &s;ome Occa|&s;ion of Jealou&s;ie to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> his Ma|je&s;ty was fain to de&s;i&s;t; though it was already pret|ty well advanced. And that excu&s;ed the Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">valier

of <HI>Moutcheuruil</HI> from the Voyage, who was made Lieu|tenant of a Ship, and doubtle&s;s had quickly been made Captain, if his Prudence had been equal to his Cou|rage. But he made a very in&s;olent An&s;wer to <HI>Mon|&s;ieur de Maurepas,</HI> when he ask'd him concerning &s;ome things he was accus'd of having taken out of one of the Ships, which the <HI>Marquis</HI> of <HI>Ne&s;mond,</HI> had taken. So that his Relations did not judge it convenient to continue him any longer in the <HI>Sea Service,</HI> for ha|ving once failed in his Re&s;pect to Mr. <HI>de Maurepas,</HI> there was no Probability, that he would ever pardon him.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut,</HI> after the Marriage of the <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Ayen,</HI> had not only reformed his Table and Reti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ue, that were both very magnificent, but under &s;ome &s;pecial Pretext, retired to <HI>Liancourt,</HI> a Place belonging to one of his Sons, at Ten or Twelve Leagues di&s;tance from <HI>Paris.</HI> However having &s;taid 6weeks there, he return'd to Court. The King &s;u&s;pected that he was &s;omewhat out of humour at the Match. He had Experience enough to know, that his Favours conferred to the Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">udice of another, gave as much Jealou&s;ie, as a Mi&s;tri&s;s's Favour to the Prejudice of a Rival, yet he took no notice of it to him, but he lo|ved his Per&s;on, and received him as affectionately, as he had u&s;ed to do. In the mean time, the Duke of <HI>Lerraine</HI> &s;ent <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Couvonges</HI> to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> to demand in his Name, <HI>Mademoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">elle</HI> in Marriage. The King expected always, both before the Peace, and &s;ince it was made, that this Prince&s;s, &s;hould have no other Husband but the King of the <HI>Romans.</HI> Nor was there any Prince&s;s in <HI>Europe,</HI> had more Preten|tions to that Happine&s;s, than She. But the Empre&s;s had &s;o very little Inclination for <HI>France,</HI> that tho' <HI>Madamoi&s;elle</HI> had been the King's own Daughter, in&s;tead of being the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI>'s, &s;he would have preferred the meane&s;t <HI>Prince&s;s</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> to her. But the Queen of <HI>Poland,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Mother, when &s;he perceived the De&s;ign of the <HI>French,</HI> was
<PB N="269" REF="428">
extreamly vexed at it, in regard of her Son's Intere&s;t. For being a Prince&s;s of extraordinary wit, &s;he knew that the &s;ituation of that young <HI>Prince's</HI> E&s;tate would oblige him to prefer an Alli|ance with <HI>France</HI> to any other, and therefore &s;he thought of making <HI>Mademoi&s;elle</HI> her Daughter in <HI>Law.</HI> However &s;he was willing to have the Empe|rour's con&s;ent to it, who in&s;inuated often to her that he would gladly be&s;tow the <HI>Archduche&s;&s;e</HI> his elde&s;t Daughter upon the <HI>Duke;</HI> but the Emperour was prevail'd upon by her Rea&s;ons; and the <HI>King</HI> accep|ted of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Couvonges's</HI> offer in the Name of his Ma&s;ter, having named <HI>Mr. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ntchartrain</HI> and &s;ome other con&s;iderable Per&s;ons of his Council todraw up the Articles of Marriage; which both Parties &s;oon agreed upon. However there aro&s;e a difficulty that retarded the Affair for &s;ome time, for the <HI>Duke of Orleans</HI> had no other male Children, than the <HI>Duke of Chartres,</HI> and that Duke had only Daugh|ters: This they had not fore&s;een in the beginning, but the <HI>Court</HI> thought fit to find &s;ome expedient for it, before they wou'd proceed any further. The difficulty con&s;i&s;ted mainly in this point; that if the <HI>Duke of Chartres</HI> came to die without Male I&s;&s;ue, then <HI>Mademoi&s;elle</HI> might have right to divide the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Dutche&s;s</HI> her Mother, with her Brothers Daughters.

&s;till very young, and of a very exemplary piety, in which he re&s;embled his Mother very much, who died &s;oon after the Marriage had been re&s;olved upon; he thought that upon all Accounts it was his advan|tage (as indeed it was) to have a <HI>Prince&s;s</HI> of <HI>France</HI> for a Wife, and therefore Sacrificed all other con&s;i|derations to that policy; and con&s;ented to renounce all he could pretend to by the Dutche&s;&s;es Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, in ca&s;e the <HI>Duke of Chartres</HI> dyed without Heirs, upon condition of having Four Hundred Thou&s;and Livers pay'd to him.</P>
<P>In this manner the marriage of the <HI>Duke</HI> with <HI>Ma|demoi&s;elle</HI> was agreed upon, and they delay'd only the final conclu&s;ion of it, till the end of the Camp, that was to be made in Honour of the <HI>Duke of Bur|gundy.</HI> They brought thither a great many more Troops, than they had at fir&s;t thought upon, which created &s;ome mi&s;tru&s;t in the Neighbouring <HI>Potentates:</HI> They were &s;en&s;ible, that the King had filed off a great many Troops to the Frontiers of <HI>Spain,</HI> nor were they ignorant of what was commonly repor|ted of his <HI>Catholick Maje&s;tie</HI>'s health, and therefore were affraid that this Camp and all the&s;e Troops were de&s;igned to make a &s;udden irruption into his Territories, if by chance he came to die, which in effect appeared very probable by all the accounts we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ad of him.

<P>This Camp ruin'd the Officers intirely, who had &s;uffered extreamly before, by the expences they were oblieged to be at, during the War. However, not one of them minded any thing, but how to

<P>But, if this Prince was &s;o Rich, as there was no rea&s;on to doubt of it, his People were in extream Poverty, in&s;omuch, that they wanted a great many things to &s;upply their Nece&s;&s;ities. But as &s;oon as the King had made the Peace, he thought of contributing to their ea&s;e. He made divers Edicts in favour of the Country People, who&s;e Lands were altogether wa&s;te for want of means to cultivate 'em. He al&s;o provided, by an Act of Council, that there &s;hou'd be no order to &s;ell the Lands of tho&s;e who carried Arms the pre|ceeding Years. He allow'd them &s;ome time for the payment of their Debts: But all this being only Paper, 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for any body to re|lieve their Nece&s;&s;ity without Money. And a great many People thought, that it had been of far greater advantage to the Kingdom, if His Maje&s;ty, in&s;tead of &s;pending his Money &s;o lavi&s;hly upon that Camp, had delt it among&s;t his People, in order to buy them Cattle: All the Country was quite out of Cattel, and by lending the People &s;ome Money, whereby they might furni&s;h them|&s;elves with &s;ome, he had re&s;tor'd a great many to Life, who were ready to Peri&s;h upon the want they had &s;uffer'd for a long time. Not but that the King had reliev'd his People in &s;ome manner, in taking off the Capitation. He had al&s;o &s;unk a great many other Taxes which were rais'd during the War. But the Sub&s;idies were agumented by a third; be&s;ides, the Corn that had continued dear for a long time, became daily dearer, which oc|ca&s;ioned new De&s;olation in a great many Families. And the poor Gentry was mo&s;t of all to be pitied, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who had Children; for after the Peace they knew not how to be&s;tow them becau&s;e by the reform which was made of the Troops, they &s;ent home all the Lieutenants as u&s;ele&s;s Mem|bers.

Nor did they continue the Pay of a reform to any, but to Captains and Lieutenants, who had &s;erv'd at lea&s;t Ten Years; in&s;omuch, that tho&s;e, who &s;erv'd under that Time, were in the mo&s;t deplorable Condition imaginable.</P>
<P>The Marquis of <HI>Dangeau,</HI> great Ma&s;ter of the Order of St. <HI>Lazarus,</HI> made, at that time, an E|&s;tabli&s;hment, that evinc'd &s;ufficiently how much Good he would have done, if it had been in his Power.

However, the Marquis of <HI>Dan|geau</HI> who had not always been very rich, and con|&s;equently knew what &s;atisfaction 'twas for a Man of Quality, who was not in circum&s;tances to edu|cate his Children according to their ranks, to have them otherwi&s;e provided for, re&s;olv'd to e&s;tabli&s;h a fond out of a certain &s;hare of the Revenues of the Grand-Ma&s;ter&s;hip, for the Education of &s;ome Children of Quality. He propos'd the Thing to the King, and His Maje&s;ty left the di&s;po&s;al of it to his own choice; upon which, he took eight Children out of the principal Families of the King|dom, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Montmorency,</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Crequi,</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Ailly,</HI> of <HI>Maille,</HI> &amp;c. He hir'd a Hou&s;e for them near <HI>Charonne,</HI> and gave them Ma&s;ters of all &s;orts with Boys to &s;erve them. The Abbot of <HI>Dangeau,</HI> his Brother, being willing to contribute to &s;o excellent an In&s;titution, took upon him&s;elf the charge of over&s;eeing them.

<P>About that time the Duke of <HI>Chaulnes</HI> fell Sick, and langui&s;h'd &s;ome time before he Died. He po&s;&s;e&s;s'd a great many con&s;iderable Employments both within and without the Kingdom; and by the&s;e means, made him&s;elf both Friends and E|nemies.

A certain Gentleman who had always appear|ed to be of the number of the la&s;t, thought it now his Duty to endeavour a reconciliation with him before he expir'd. I mean the Cardinal <HI>D'E&s;trees,</HI> who was at <HI>Rome</HI> while the Duke was <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary,</HI> at that Court, from the King. The Cardinal was reputed a Man of Parts, and, upon that account, was ambitious to have the pre|ference over all, which was the cau&s;e of their dif|ference. But the Re&s;pect &s;hown to the Duke, at the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> gave him &s;ome Ombrage: So that their mi&s;under&s;tanding was no &s;ecret any any where; and no con&s;ideration oblig'd the Car|dinal to ob&s;erve any mea&s;ures in it. However, whether he thought him&s;elf in the wrong, or that he had a mind to appear a good Chri&s;tian, he came at that time to ask his Pardon. The Duke was extreamly &s;urpriz'd when they told him the Cardinal was come to wait on him; it was no more &s;ea&s;onable for him to think upon any Re|&s;entment, tho', perhaps, he had been very capable of it at another time; therefore he de&s;ir'd he might come in, and there they were reconcil'd to one another. In a few days after the Duke Died, and left the Chancellor his Te&s;tamentary Executor. The D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ceas'd had Married the Widow of the Marquis of St. <HI>Maigrin,</HI> Lieutenant of the Light-Hor&s;e.

But this la&s;t government was thought very proper for the Count of <HI>Thoulou&s;e,</HI> the King's Na|tural Son; therefore His Maje&s;ty got him to re&s;ign it in his favour; and the King gave him <HI>that</HI> of <HI>Guyenne</HI> in exchange.</P>
<P>The Government of <HI>Guyenne</HI> was not long va|cant after his Death, which fell out very conve|niently for the Duke of <HI>Chartres,</HI> to whom the King had promis'd it, when that Duke Married the Count of <HI>Thoulou&s;e</HI>'s Si&s;ter. The King had given the &s;urvivance of it to the Duke of <HI>Chevre|u&s;e;</HI> but that Duke had already a hundred Thou|&s;and Livers in Rent; and, be&s;ides, the Duke of <HI>Chaulnes</HI> his Lands produc'd no le&s;s; &s;o, that all of a &s;udden two hundred Thou&s;and Livers a Year fell into the Family. So that he was already be|come &s;o Rich, that <HI>that</HI> Government wou'd prove rather &s;uperfluous than u&s;eful to him. But Quieti&s;t as he was, he lov'd Riches nothing the le&s;s.

Yet, be how it will, the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray</HI> was no|thing like him: He &s;uffer'd his Exile very peace|ably; and, without making the lea&s;t noi&s;e, bore the Impri&s;onment of his good Friend Madam <HI>Guy|on.</HI> She was brought from the Convent about <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> time, in order to be &s;ent to the <HI>Ba&s;tille,</HI> where &s;he was left for four or five Months to ex|amine her Con&s;cience, and then &s;he was interrogat|ed, tho' 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to know upon what; for that &s;ort of things are always very &s;ecret: But, according to what one can judge, it was upon &s;ome things contain'd in a Book Publi&s;h'd by the Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> again&s;t the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cam|bray,</HI> in which &s;he was made mention of.

It charg'd her with a great many Revela|tions and Miracles; in a word, it endeavour'd, by rendring her ridiculous, to make the Blow fall up|on the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> her good Friend. However, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI> his principal Ad|ver&s;ary, could not obtain his being declar'd a <HI>He|retick,</HI> pur&s;uant to his Allegations. The Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s 'tis to give Sentence upon that Head, was very re&s;erv'd upon the Point; whether it was that they &s;aw no occa&s;ion for &s;uch a Declaration, or that by drilling on the Affair, they thought to appear more my&s;terious. The Court e&s;pous'd the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI>'s Intere&s;t very much; and after having remov'd the Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray</HI> from the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI>'s Pre&s;ence, did likewi&s;e remove his Nephew, that Prince's Sub-preceptor, together with &s;ome other Per&s;ons who were &s;u&s;pected of adhering to his Sentiments. Two of his waiting Gentlemen were among the number of tho&s;e who were di&s;graced, tho' the occa&s;ion of it might &s;eem foreign enough to their Profe&s;&s;ion. In fine, to cut off all hopes of ever returning to be about his Per&s;on, others were put in their places, who, perhaps, are no better Men than they: For we mu&s;t know, that tho&s;e who were remov'd, were Per&s;ons of exemplary Piety; in&s;omuch, that all the Kingdom over there were none to be found that liv'd a more Chri&s;tian Life. However, their Enemies employ'd all their art to ruin them, whether it was that they really thought them tainted with that Doctrine, or that they only cover'd their private views with that Pretence: So it was; that new Faces &s;tarted up all of a &s;udden about the Young Prince. This was not at all agreeable to the Prince, at lea&s;t it &s;eem|ed &s;o. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cambray,</HI> who wrote from time to time to the Pope, according as the divers Charges were laid again&s;t him, having, at that time, &s;ent His Holine&s;s a Letter which was mightily cried up; the young Prince declar'd open|ly,

But, be&s;ides that there were but very few Copies of it to be &s;een in the Kingdom, grievous Puni&s;hments being in|flicted upon tho&s;e who di&s;per&s;ed them, no-body dur&s;t offer to &s;atisfie his De&s;ire for fear of di&s;|plea&s;ing the King. From thence the A. B. of <HI>Cam|bray</HI>'s Friends took occa&s;ion to cen&s;ure his Enemies. They Publi&s;h'd that it was always allowable for any Man to make his Defences, and their of|fering in this manner to hinder them, &s;poke their unju&s;tice.

His Son had Married, for his fir&s;t Wife, the Daughter of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Lionne,</HI> Secretary of State, by whom he had a Son, and &s;ome Daugh|ters; and for his &s;econd, a Daughter of the Mar|quis <HI>de Vaubrun,</HI> Lieutenant of the King's Armies. This la&s;t did not know where to recover her <HI>Dow|ry,</HI> and, by con&s;equence, had been at a lo&s;s where to &s;ecure her <HI>Joynture,</HI> if the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Laon</HI> her Husband's Brother, had not engag'd in the Con|tract of Marriage, for two hundred thou&s;and Li|vers to the Children that he &s;hou'd have by her. The King, to whom the Duke had recommended his Family before he was cut, gave his Govern|ment to his Elde&s;t Son; the other depended &s;ole|ly upon his Succe&s;&s;ion to his Mother, who cou'd not but be very Rich, tho &s;he had lo&s;t &s;omething by her Husband: For her Mother was &s;till alive as well as her Mother's Father, who was worth two Millions of Money. Now, he having only two Heire&s;&s;es, namely, the Marchione&s;s of <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|levrier</HI> and her &s;elf; the half of it was one day to be he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s. It is true, the Dutche&s;s had a Brother, who pur&s;uant to the preference of Males, was intitled to the better half of the Succe&s;&s;ion; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e being &s;et apart for the Church, by rea&s;on of his D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cripitne&s;s and being already po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of Benefices, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> reckon'd that he ought never to Marry. And i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, there was no great appear|ance or it, tho' we every day meet with things more extraordinary than that. But the Thing that
<PB N="281" REF="440">
troubled her mo&s;t was, That he lov'd Mony; &s;o that tho he did not Marry, it was to be fear'd he might not grant her his &s;hare of his Grandfather's E&s;tate. He had but lately given a &s;ignal in&s;tance of his Love for Money, by maintaining a Law-Suit for a &s;mall Living, that he had procur'd from him, who&s;e natural right it was to grant it. The Dean of <HI>Nants</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd it formerly; and he having re&s;ign'd it to one of his Friends, Abbot <HI>Vaubrun</HI> pretended, that his Re&s;ignation cou'd not be vali'd; for that he had not liv'd upon it a competent &s;pace of time, for being admitted in the Court of <HI>Rome.</HI> However, the contrary &s;eem'd to appear, by the Will of the Decea&s;ed; but he af|firm'd that to be a Fraud, and &s;aid, that the Cura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e was Cheated. In the mean time he had a Permi&s;&s;ion to rai&s;e monitory Letters, in order to find a Di&s;covery by tho&s;e that had a&s;&s;i&s;ted to keep the Body a long time after his Death, that they might favour his Party. However, fearing le&s;t tho&s;e who were concern'd might be pretty nimble, he obtain'd a Decree in Ju&s;tice, that the Body &s;hould be uninterr'd, pretending, that by viewing it, it were ea&s;ie to di&s;cover the Cheat. The Judges granted him his Demand, and &s;o the poor Body was pull'd out of the Coffin half Rotten: In fine, tho' it ca&s;t a very nau&s;eous Smell, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible to approach it by a hundred paces, yet he caus'd it to be view'd by the Phy&s;icians and Chirurgeons, in order to have their Opinion of it. He put 'em upon an odd &s;ort of Bu&s;ine&s;s; but think|ing they were very well accu&s;tom'd to the&s;e &s;ort of Perfumes, he did not regard it &s;o much. The Phy&s;icians and Chirurgeons turn'd over and over the Dead Body, and having given a doubtful ac|count of it, it was inter'd again in a more &s;tinking Condition than it had been when it was taken up. The Abbot <HI>Vaubrun,</HI> &s;eeing, that by their Judg|ment he was like to be Ca&s;t, and condemned to pay the Charges, obtain'd another Judgment that
<PB N="282" REF="441">
the &s;ame Body might be view'd by other more skilful Per&s;ons: And thus it was taken up a &s;e|cond time; and the&s;e skilful Gentlemen having been more favourable to him than the former, he, in the end, gain'd the Suit.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Abbot of <HI>Rochefoucaut</HI> coming to die, the Abbot <HI>Verthuel</HI> his Brother, ask'd two good Abbies which he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; but His Maje&s;ty refus'd him. However, having al|ways a great e&s;teem for the Duke of <HI>Rochefoucaut,</HI> Brother to the two Abbots, though he had ab|&s;ented from coming to Court for &s;ix Weeks af|ter the Count of <HI>Ayen</HI>'s Marriage, he conde|&s;cended to give him a Rea&s;on for that refu&s;al; becau&s;e, as His Maje&s;ty alledg'd, He had not found the Abbot <HI>Vertheuel</HI>'s Conduct regular enough to oblige him to be&s;tow upon him Goods of the Church, which, perhaps, he might employ to an other u&s;e than they were de&s;ign'd for. His Ma|je&s;ty added, that to &s;hew that he was very wil|ling to oblige him, when it did not interfere with his Con&s;cience, he re&s;tor'd the Abbies po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Decea&s;ed, upon the Old Abbot <HI>de la Rochefou|caut,</HI> his Uncle. The Old Abbot dream'd nothing of &s;uch a Wind-fall. He had retir'd into his own Country a long while before, without thinking of ever returning to Court: But Fortune pur&s;uing him as far as his Retreat, his only care then was to return Thanks to His Maje&s;ty, and to &s;end to <HI>Rome</HI> for his Bulls.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s of <HI>Epinois,</HI> and the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richelieu</HI> died &s;oon after, the one three days af|ter the other. The former Died in le&s;s than an Hours Sickne&s;s, the latter had been long troubled with a tedious Di&s;temper. The Prince&s;s <HI>d'Epinois</HI> was walking out of the Marquis of <HI>Barbe&s;ieux</HI> his Hou&s;e, when &s;he was &s;eiz'd of a &s;udden with a vi|olent Pain: Pre&s;ently &s;he &s;top'd and took hold of a Window-&s;hutter to keep her from falling: But in that minute &s;he lo&s;t her Sen&s;es, and being car|ried
<PB N="283" REF="442">
Home Died in the &s;pace of a Quarter of an Hour. She was one of the greate&s;t players at <HI>Lan&s;quenette,</HI> at <HI>Marli,</HI> and many imputed this Accident to her con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es, which had|made &s;o great an alteration in her Blood, that it had been a Miracle if &s;ome trouble&s;ome thing or other had not come upon her. Mr. <HI>Pelletier,</HI> In|tendant of the Finances, to whom, 'tis &s;aid, &s;he was Married in the way of Con&s;cience, was mightily afflicted at her Death. However, that did not keep him from going to <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> to Coun|cil. The fir&s;t time he appear'd every body con|dol'd his Lo&s;s, becau&s;e all the World knew how far he was concern'd; nay, the King him&s;elf knew it, and one time when the Prince&s;s had lo&s;t a great Summ at <HI>Marli,</HI> and pay'd it next day, to the great &s;urprizal of a great many who thought &s;he was not in a Condition to rai&s;e it &s;o &s;oon; His Maje&s;ty did not &s;tand to ask Mr. <HI>Pelletier</HI> if 'twas not he that had lent it her: Upon that Mr. <HI>Pelle|tier</HI> own'd that &s;he had <HI>had</HI> recour&s;e to him to &s;ave her Honour. I know not whether His Maje&s;ty did not carry his Curio&s;ity further, and ask'd him if he was not Married to her; That being above my Knowledge, I &s;hall know nothing of it for fear of incurring the imputation of a Lye. That Lady had two Sons and two Daughters by her Husband. The Daughters were &s;till Unmarried. 'Twas the Elde&s;t of 'em that the Prince&s;s of <HI>Conty,</HI> the King's Daughter would have married to the Marquis <HI>de Valliere.</HI> As for the Sons, the Younger Died a Natural Death, and the Elder had mar|ried a Daughter of the Prince <HI>de la I&s;le Bonne,</HI> of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Lorain.</HI></P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Richelieu</HI> left behind her a Son, and &s;ome Daughters. The Birth of that Son had extingui&s;h'd all the hopes of the Marquis of <HI>Rich|lieu,</HI> the Duke's Nephew, who was intitled to the Succe&s;&s;ion, in ca&s;e of no Male I&s;&s;ue. He being a little upon the fret, and nothing being more capa|ble
<PB N="284" REF="443">
to di&s;turb one's Conduct than Poverty, his Wife and he did not agree very well; notwith|&s;tanding he had run away with her, and &s;he de|&s;erv'd a more honourable U&s;age. In fine, whe|ther this mi&s;under&s;tanding increas'd every day, or that his Poverty oblig'd him to avoid the Charges that attend People of their Quality, they parted in the beginning of the Year 1698; and &s;he went to <HI>England</HI> to her Mother; but it being impo&s;&s;ible that &s;o pretty a Creature as &s;he, &s;hou'd not have many Admirers; her Husband was quick|ly &s;en&s;ible, that in &s;triving to be rid of one evil, he had brought another upon him&s;elf, that was equal|ly un&s;upportable. He was &s;eiz'd with a deep jea|lou&s;ie, and being, upon that &s;core, re&s;tle&s;s both Night and Day, he &s;et all Springs at Work to o|blige his Lady to return out of that Country. She thinking &s;he could not be better than with her Mother, would not li&s;ten to any Propo&s;al he could make. A Wife &s;eldom gives ear to the Voice of a Hu&s;|band at a di&s;tance, e&s;pecially a Husband that gives her no relief in time of need: So he was oblig'd to fall upon other mea&s;ures. In the mean time, the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI>'s Daughter was Married to the Duke of <HI>Lorain</HI> by way of Proxy. The King &s;ent the Young Prince&s;s &s;ome Pre&s;ents, upon which &s;he left the Court immediately, and after &s;taying but 24 hours as <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;et out immediately to <HI>Bar,</HI> pur&s;uant to the Duke the Bridegroom's or|ders, who was to meet her there. The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Bar</HI> was fitted up for her Reception. When the Duke went to his E&s;tate, he found all his Hou&s;es out of order; for the King's Intendants, in that Country, had minded them&s;elves more than any thing el&s;e, and had &s;carce taken care to make the nece&s;&s;ary Reparations. The Duke did not go at fir&s;t to <HI>Nancy,</HI> becau&s;e the King's Troops were there demoli&s;hing the Fortifications: So he &s;top'd four or five Leagues on the other &s;ide of it; whither he, who Commanded the King's Troops, &s;ent him
<PB N="285" REF="444">
a Captain, with &s;ome Soldiers for his Guard: But that Prince refus'd 'em, thinking it more con|venient to imploy the Militia of his Country. Ac|cordingly the Inhabitants of <HI>Nancy,</HI> and the other Towns, provided &s;ome Companies of Hor&s;e and Foot, till &s;uch time as his regular Troops &s;hould be in readine&s;s, for which he had given out Com|mi&s;&s;ions. In fine, the Duke came to his capital City, when the King's Troops march'd out. As &s;oon as the Duke heard the News, that the young Prince&s;s was upon her Journey to <HI>Lorrain,</HI> he came to <HI>Bar,</HI> and, in the mean time, the Inhabitants of <HI>Nancy,</HI> made preparations for her Entry, in pro|portion to their Ability. For, be&s;ides the oppre&s;|&s;ion they had lain under for the fifty or &s;ixty Years, that their Country was cover'd with forreign Troops, they began to feel the terrible effects of a Famine, which was general, not only over that Country, but all the adjacent States; &s;o that their Neighbours were almo&s;t in the &s;ame Condition. In &s;ome places, indeed, the Sea&s;on &s;eem'd to pro|mi&s;e Plenty; but when they came to thre&s;h the Corn, it did not yield the half of what it us'd to do. Nay, <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf, which us'd to furni&s;h others with Corn, was fir&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the want of it; and &s;uch Di&s;orders happen'd upon the marching of the Troops, that the Judges of the <HI>Police</HI> were oblig'd to defend the Bakers with the &s;trong hand; for the Poor People were like to fall upon 'em and Rob 'em; &s;o great was their Mi&s;ery. In the Streets of <HI>Paris</HI> there was nothing to be &s;een but Troops of Beggars, which were yet more numerous in the Country. Mr. <HI>d' Argen&s;on</HI> was &s;o watchful in the City, that they dur&s;t not hara&s;s the People there, as they did el&s;e-where: Tho', after all, &s;ome of the&s;e hungry wretches pay'd a vi&s;it to the Bakers that were coming from <HI>Gonne&s;&s;e,</HI> and one of 'em gave a Baker a Wound with his Knife, becau&s;e he would not &s;ell his Bread at what price he pleas'd.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="445">
As every body thinks of nothing but getting, &s;o this Dearth put a great many U&s;urers upon rai&s;ing the price of Bread yet higher. It being reported that the Farmers General were the People that laid up Magazines of Corn, in order to make up the Lo&s;s they had &s;u&s;tain'd upon the Taxes for that the Wine was quite lo&s;t that Year; the fir&s;t Pre&s;i|dent gave 'em to know, that if it was true, they not only run the ri&s;que of being pillag'd, but ruin'd to boot; for he was a Man that would not pardon &s;uch things; and the Intere&s;t of the State and Count|ry was &s;ufficient to draw &s;uch Threats from him in good earne&s;t. Tho' this was a &s;ufficient cau&s;e of Fear to tho&s;e who were con&s;cious of their own Guilt; yet &s;ome were &s;o covetous, that they would venture all rather than mi&s;s &s;uch an opportunity of getting Money. There was one <HI>Miotte</HI> that had Farm'd the E&s;tate of <HI>Meudon,</HI> from the D. of <HI>Or|leans;</HI> and, upon that &s;core, thought him&s;elf proof again&s;t any thing that might happen: This Man bought up Corn every where, and made va&s;t Maga|zines in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Montereau Fautyonne.</HI> Mr. <HI>D'Argen&s;on</HI> and the chief Pre&s;ident being inform'd of it, the former took him up, and the latter pa&s;|&s;ed a Decree again&s;t him, in&s;omuch, that if he had not found Friends to di&s;&s;wade the Pre&s;ident from &s;eizing upon his Per&s;on, he had gone near to have been Hang'd: But the Court it &s;elf in&s;pected the matter, and it being try'd before the Council, he was clear'd for a Fine of 1000 Livers, and the con|fi&s;cation of &s;ome part of the Corn. Some other U&s;urers had much the &s;ame u&s;age; for the Judges could not deal more &s;everely with them, without making it known that <HI>Miotte</HI>'s Friends were the occa&s;ion of the Favour &s;hewn him. However, Mr. <HI>d'Argen&s;on</HI> concerted mea&s;ures for preventing the like for the future; and &s;ent Commi&s;&s;aries with Per&s;ons that he could confide in, all over the Coun|try, for there was no doing of it without ranging the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="446">
The mi&s;ery of the People fill'd both <HI>Paris</HI> and the Country with Robbers; and the Inhabitants were &s;carce &s;afe in their Hou&s;es. They dur&s;t not &s;tir abroad, nor travel either early or late, becau&s;e the poor Wretches were &s;o de&s;perate as to be ca|pable of any thing; but Mr. <HI>d'Argen&s;on</HI> took the Alarm upon this, as well as all other di&s;orders; while Mr. <HI>de la Reinie,</HI> his Predece&s;&s;or, minded nothing but the peaceable enjoyment of the Fruit of his Labours. He had but a Son and a Daughter with a va&s;t E&s;tate; for being all a long very cunning he had laid up an infinity of money. He was &s;omewhat di&s;&s;atisfied with his Son, who had been at <HI>Rome</HI> a long while, and minded nothing but the Pictures and other Curio&s;ities of the City, without regarding his Father's Example, who had rais'd him&s;elf to the highe&s;t Po&s;t of the Law, tho' he begun with the Lowe&s;t. So that Magi&s;trate careing only for his Daughter, re&s;olv'd to marry her as honour|able as he could. There was enough that offer'd to be Suitors; but one <HI>Machaut,</HI> a Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts, carried his Suit &s;o far, that, after &s;ome Di&s;pute, Articles were mutually &s;ign'd. After that, the Lover came to pay his Re&s;pects to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he had never &s;een. But &s;he being not Hand&s;ome, he lik'd her &s;o ill, that he told her Father, That the only way to make him mi&s;er|able, was to oblige him to fini&s;h what he had begun. Her Father was a little nettled at the Compliment; however he indeavour|ed to get off as honourably as he could. He did not ask him the cau&s;e of the Breach; but &s;u&s;pecting what it was, he agreed to what he de&s;ir'd, becau&s;e he would not give his Daughter to a Man that did not Love her.</P>
<P>The D. of <HI>Loraine</HI> having &s;tay'd &s;ome days at <HI>Bar</HI> with his Spou&s;e, carry'd her to <HI>Nancy,</HI> where &s;he met with &s;ome Magni|ficence, notwith&s;tanding the publick Calamity; but being bred up at the proude&s;t Court in the World, &s;he minded that far le&s;s than the Love of that People for their Sovereign. They &s;hew|ed it in all their Actions; and what animated 'em very much was, the exemplary Piety of that Young Prince, who, upon that &s;core, might be call'd the Prodigy of the Age. He would &s;ee neither Play nor Opera, nor allow of 'em about his Court: He look'd upon tho&s;e Diver&s;ions, not only as unworthy of a Chri&s;tian, but contrary to the Duty of &s;o Holy a Profe&s;&s;ion. He was the Son of a Father and Mother, that, in their time, were patterns of Vertue; and 'twas plain that he indeavour'd to make the be&s;t u&s;e of the Le&s;&s;ons they had given him. The Bi|&s;hop of <HI>O&s;nabrug,</HI> the Duke's Brother, arriv'd, at that time, at the Court of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> upon his return from his Bi&s;hoprick which he had obtain'd about five or &s;ix months before, by the recom|mend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t on of the Emperour his Uncle. He is a hand&s;ome Prince, and one that knows his Perfections very well. A Brother of the Elector of <HI>Hannover</HI>'s was formerly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of that Bi&s;hoprick, which, pur&s;uant to the Treaty of <HI>Munster,</HI> ought to be fill'd by a Prote&s;tant and a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick, by turns.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="447">
As &s;oon as the D. of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Coun|tries, he gave advice of it to all the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uant to the u&s;ual Cu&s;tom. He likewi&s;e notified his Marriage in the &s;ame manner. And in the mean time indeavour'd by his good Conduct to repair the Di&s;orders that the War had oc|ca&s;ion'd in &s;o long a &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>In the mean time the P. of <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y</HI> gain'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">s Suit before the High Court of Parliament as well as before the Court of Reque&s;ts. This &s;olac'd him entirely upon the lo&s;s of the Crown<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">: <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oland;</HI> tho' there was a great deal of difference between the one and the other. The New K. of <HI>Poland</HI> did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> his Crown in Tranquillity. Some of his Subjects charging him with a great many things, were &s;o bold as to &s;end a fre&s;h Me&s;&s;age to <HI>Ver&s;ail|les,</HI> praying the King to a&s;&s;i&s;t 'em with Men and Money for the recovery of their Liberty, which, as they alledg'd, was over|run by his U&s;urpation. They accus'd him of Sacrificing the Na|tion to his private Intere&s;ts; But His Maje&s;ty would not med|dle in the matter.</P>
<P>The Emperor, as well as the D. of <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rain,</HI> had form'd a de|&s;ign to procure repo&s;e to his People, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ibly he could. This he could not effect without making Peace with the <HI>Turks,</HI> which at la&s;t he con&s;ented to, tho' they were &s;en&s;ible they were upon the brink of Ruin. He accepted the Mediation of the K. of <HI>England,</HI> and the States General; and the <HI>Turks</HI> having done the &s;ame, an Interview was agreed upon at <HI>Carlowitz,</HI> in or|der to adju&s;t the Difference between the two Emperors. In the mean time, he gave notice of all to his Allies, to the end that they having joyntly carried on &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful a War, might mutu|ally concur in procuring a Peace equally advantageous to the one as well as to the other.</P>
<P>At that time the K. of <HI>England</HI> went to <HI>Germany,</HI> in order to come nearer the place where the Conferences were held. He &s;top|ed at the Court of <HI>Hannover,</HI> which occa&s;ion'd as much unea&s;i|ne&s;s to <HI>France,</HI> as <HI>France</HI> occa&s;ion'd to the Allies by the Camp they had form'd. In the mean time Amba&s;&s;adors repair'd from all quarter to <HI>Carlowitz.</HI> His <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty de&s;ir'd this Peace very pa&s;&s;ionately, in order to give &s;ome jealou&s;ie to <HI>France,</HI> and to &s;ee the Emperor's growing Power at a &s;tand: For he wi&s;h'd rather that the Emperor &s;hould &s;tand in need of his help, than he of the Emperor's. But the Year was over before that great Work was concluded; as well as before the K. of the <HI>Romans</HI> his Marriage with the Prince&s;s of <HI>Hannover</HI> was compleated.
