<HEAD>ADVICE
TO THE
PEOPLE
OF
<HI>Great Britain.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE PUBLICK PEACE
is ju&s;tly the concern of every
true lover of his Country, the
Warmth and Fire that ap|pears
on every &s;ide in its turn, and
Prompts us to fall in upon one another,
with Re&s;entment for Mi&s;carriages, ra|ther
than Caution again&s;t them, may be
ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected to proceed more from
private and narrow Views, than from
that generous and broad hearted princi|ple
of Love to a Country which every
Man would be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by, but
which &s;o few Under&s;tand.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
No Man can be &s;aid to pur&s;ue the
true intere&s;t of his Country, but he that
makes it the utmo&s;t End of all his Mea|&s;ures
to re&s;tore and e&s;tabli&s;h the PUB|LICK
PEACE; This alone makes a
Nation Great, Rich, Powerful, and Hap|py.
Without Peace the World is a rag|ing
<HI>Bedlam,</HI> where every (<HI>Lunatick</HI>) In|habitant
is &s;eparated from the re&s;t to pre|vent
them Devouring and De&s;troying one
another; A great Forre&s;t where the Inha|bitants
are all Bea&s;ts of Prey, watching
to tear one another to Pieces, the &s;tron|ger
Hunting after the Weaker, the
Greater falling upon the Le&s;s.</P>
<P>Peace is the End of Society, the Rea|&s;on
of Government, the Con&s;equence of
Laws, and the Felicity of Life.</P>
<P>By PEACE here I am to be under|&s;tood
to be &s;peaking of the Civil Peace;
Peace at home, (<HI>viz.</HI>) with our Rulers,
and with our &s;elves; and I make the
Di&s;tinction here, becau&s;e I &s;hall indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly
avoid entring into that Part which
has occa&s;ioned &s;o much the Breach of our
Peace <HI>at home</HI> for &s;ome time pa&s;t, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<HI>Peace</HI> as it relates to War, Alliances, Trea|ties,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> with our Neighbours abroad.</P>
<P>We have been mi&s;erably divided a|mong
our &s;elves for &s;ome time. The Feud
which began in the Court has &s;pread it
<PB N="5" REF="4">
&s;elf thro' the whole Nation, and has &s;o
Univer&s;ally prevail'd, that it has been
next to impo&s;&s;ible for any Man, private
or publick, but much le&s;s the latter, to
live and call him&s;elf a NEUTER:
The Breach at Court in the di&s;placing
the Mini&s;try, tho' it was not the fir&s;t of
the Fire, yet it was the fir&s;t of the
Flame. The HOUSE, (<HI>Nation</HI>) was
on Fire before, in the &s;ecret Di&s;contents
and Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es that po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the
Parties one again&s;t another, and which
&s;hew'd it &s;elf upon every Occa&s;ion; but
it was not broken out till the di&s;placing
the Mini&s;try, and di&s;&s;olving the Parlia|ment
in 1710. Then it was a perfect
Flame, which burnt out to the terror of
all good Men who wi&s;h'd well to their
Country; burning up all our National
Peace, embarking the whole Kingdom in
the Di&s;order, and threatning to leave us a
prey to the fir&s;t Enemy that had Hands
to lay hold on us.</P>
<P>The Parties who bandied the Nation
again&s;t it &s;elf, and by who&s;e Rage our
Ruin was &s;o near, may without making
u&s;e of the invidious Names given to one
another, be thus di&s;tingui&s;hed. (1.) <HI>The
People di&s;placed,</HI> who to make them&s;elves
popular, decry'd the Per&s;ons and Mea|&s;ures
of tho&s;e who had di&s;plac'd them,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
&s;ugge&s;ting the Ruin of the Con&s;titution,
Inva&s;ion of Liberty, and overthrow of
the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, in favour of
the Pretender. (2.) The People in Place,
who to confirm them&s;elves, vindicated
their di&s;placing the other, by &s;ugge&s;t|ing
Male-Admini&s;tration, &s;elfi&s;h De|&s;igns,
and corrupt Practices to the De|triment
of the Nation, ruining the People
by the length of the War, and deny|ing
them nece&s;&s;ary Peace, on pretence of
obtaining it at la&s;t with more Advan|tages
by the Continuance of the War.</P>
<P>I hope it will not be expected I &s;hould
enter here into the Merits of the re|&s;pective
Preten&s;ions, and &s;o make this
Tract which is de&s;igned for the clo&s;ing
the&s;e Breaches, be a Declaration of the
carrying them farther on, taking on me
a Power of judging and cen&s;uring either
one &s;ide or other; this is no part of a Re|conciler,
which is my Province at this
time; I &s;hall therefore only draw two Ob|&s;ervations
from the brief Account given
above of our late Divi&s;ions, which I leave
to the Reflection of tho&s;e who have
been concerned.</P>
<P>1. That the <HI>Old Party</HI> would never
have &s;tood out &s;o long, had they believed
the <HI>New,</HI> would have been able to have
maintained them&s;elves &s;o firmly again&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="6">
the Vigorous and Powerful Attacks they
were to meet with.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>New Party</HI> would not have
done many things which they were ob|liged
to do, nor have made u&s;e of many
of tho&s;e Hands which at la&s;t they were
obliged to make u&s;e of, if the <HI>Old</HI> had
not &s;tood out &s;o ob&s;tinately, and &s;o long.</P>
<P>By the&s;e two unhappy Incidents, the
Party War among us was both Spun out
to a greater Length, and blown up to a
greater Flame than either &s;ide at fir&s;t fore|&s;aw,
or as I believe intended; till it
came to that highth that it began to be
the Opinion of &s;erious and judicious Men
on both Sides, that it could never be
made up, that the Parties could never
part without Blows, and that it mu&s;t in
a &s;hort time involve us in Confu&s;ion and
Blood.</P>
<P>But the I&s;&s;ue as well in what is &s;een,
as in what was but ju&s;t appearing, has
&s;hewn us that things were not quite &s;o bad
as we feared; and that there were yet a
Body of Men, even in the new Mini&s;try,
<HI>and at the Head of it too,</HI> who tho' they made
u&s;e of In&s;truments for their Convenience,
yet &s;aw with other Eyes than tho&s;e In|&s;truments
&s;aw with, and pur&s;ued other
Ends than they pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted but there was a
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Party of Men who were &s;ecretly inclin'd
to propagate the Intere&s;t of the Preten|der
tho' they put on a different Face in
all their Tran&s;actions; the&s;e fooli&s;hly,
and very weakly, flattering them&s;elves
that they &s;hould find an Opportunity to
turn up their own Card Trump, joined
them&s;elves with the Party who were up|permo&s;t,
and as they thought for that
Rea&s;on &s;tronge&s;t.</P>
<P>Two things were to be ob&s;erved of
the&s;e Mens Conduct all the while they
were playing this Game (<HI>viz.</HI>) that (1.)
They were willing to precipitate the
publick Affairs into all the warm and
extravagant Hights they could le&s;t the
di&s;plac'd Party, finding room to hope well
of moderate Mea&s;ures, &s;hould think of
reconciling them&s;elves to the Mini&s;try,
and coming in. (2.) They &s;ecretly in|flam'd
the &s;aid di&s;plac'd Party again&s;t the
Mini&s;try, and propagated every &s;ecret &s;tep
that might alarm them, that as they might
be more aver&s;e to a Reconciliation on
one Hand, &s;o the Mini&s;try might be pro|vok'd
on the other, not to hearken any
more to Accommodations.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;ecret Party had acted till
they thought their Game &s;o &s;ure, and
their Intere&s;t &s;o &s;trong, that they could
overmatch any Man who they had the
<PB N="9" REF="8">
lea&s;t Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect would oppo&s;e
them, and aiming at no le&s;s than the
Prime Mini&s;try, they re&s;olved either to
bring it into their own Hands, or if not,
then to bring it into their own Manage|ment.</P>
<P>The
End which the&s;e men aim'd at, as
before they &s;ound Impracticable as things
&s;tood; the Per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Power
of Prime Mini&s;ter, having views quite dif|ferent
from theirs, and which they were
indeed penetrating enough to &s;ee would
at la&s;t overthrow them.</P>
<P>Their next &s;tep then was to make him
unea&s;y, and to render him &s;u&s;pected; re|proaching
him with being a Presbyterian
in his Heart, inclin'd to the Whigs, and ha|ving
taken &s;ecret Mea&s;ures to betray
them all to a new Scheme of Moderati|on;
to erect a third Party between the Ex|treams
of the other two, and &s;o to lay
them wholly a&s;ide.</P>
<P>This part they carry'd on with more
Succe&s;s than they at fir&s;t expected; for
the Prime Mini&s;ter, tho' he form'd no
middle Party as they alleag'd, yet
&s;eeing evidently that they drove on at
a rate that would certainly plunge
the Queen, not only into Breaches with
her Neighbours, but with her own Sub|jects;
Al&s;o that they had views fatal to
<PB N="10" REF="9">
the publick Peace, and founded al&s;o up|on
impracticable Schemes which mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily ruin them&s;elves; I &s;ay, &s;eeing
this was the Ca&s;e, after in vain endea|vouring
to keep them within the bounds
of Rea&s;on, and Duty to their Country
and them&s;elves; and after having long
born the &s;candal of their Mea&s;ures, and
been reproach'd in Publick, as if he had
been the Actor of what he &s;o often, and &s;o
con&s;tantly oppo&s;ed, he gradually declin|ed
them, yielded to the Importunities of
the Times, left them to try their own
Wi&s;dom, and at la&s;t drew entirely out
of the Management.</P>
<P>It was not three Days that the&s;e Men
&s;tood by them&s;elves, but they appeared
to be unequal to the weight they had ta|ken
upon them, and that they were no
more capable to guide the State without
that able Head they had parted from,
than he was able by his Wi&s;dom and
Authority to Guide them, and keep them
within tho&s;e moderate Mea&s;ures of Go|vernment
which alone could pre&s;erve
them. The weakne&s;s di&s;covered it &s;elf
&s;o far that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of their new Model
immediately fell a&s;under, and every one
&s;etting up for them&s;elves, they began to
fall into that Confu&s;ion that was foretold
them.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
This &s;tep of the Prime Mini&s;ter was
infinitely to his Advantage, in that it re|&s;tored
him to the Opinion of &s;ome ho|ne&s;t
Men who had been prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd
again&s;t him for tho&s;e Steps which it was
now apparent were the Produce of a &s;e|cret
Faction who topt upon the Mini|&s;try;
and who as it now evidently ap|peared
were in an Intere&s;t that no ho|ne&s;t
Man could longer join with. It was
al&s;o advantageous to the Publick, that
this &s;ecret Hi&s;tory might come to light,
and that the Mi&s;chiefs the&s;e hot Men
were likely to bring upon us, might be
prevented.</P>
<P>In this Po&s;ture Affairs &s;tood when
Heaven took the Work into its own
Hand, and the Queen who was not a lit|tle
touch'd with the Folly and Heat of
the&s;e Men, had taken her fir&s;t &s;tep con|trary
to their Mea&s;ures, and given the
Trea&s;ury from them, was &s;truck with
Death to the un&s;peakable Grief of all her
faithful Subjects, who albeit our Divi&s;i|ons
had le&s;&s;ened the common Charity of
the People one towards another, had yet
a profound Veneration, and an unfeign'd
Duty and Affection to her Per&s;on, ha|ving
been brought to it by the mo&s;t
engaging, inoffen&s;ive, tender and af|fectionate
Treatment of all her Subjects,
<PB N="12" REF="11">
without Di&s;tinction, the mo&s;t exemplary
Life, &s;teady Piety, and Beneficent mer|ciful
Reign of any Soveraign that ever &s;at
upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne.</P>
<P>When the Queen was Dead, the im|mediate
thing that pre&s;ented was the
LAW. By this the Succe&s;&s;or to the
Crown, and the Duty of the Mini&s;ters of
State were &s;o expere&s;ly laid down, the Per|&s;ons
who were to a&s;&s;ume the Regency ap|pointed,
and the &s;evere Penalty to be
inflicted on the lea&s;t Neglect &s;o &s;et forth;
that no &s;ecret De&s;igns of any Men, or
Party of Men could po&s;&s;ibly prevent the
Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion taking Place.</P>
<P>This it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed has confirm'd
the Opinion of tho&s;e who before the&s;e
Things happened, profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves
&s;atisfy'd in the Security of the Parliamen|tary
Provi&s;ion for the Succe&s;&s;ion, and
were therefore not &s;o apprehen&s;ive of the
Danger of the Pretender as others were,
who yet were &s;incerely in the Intere&s;t
of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion; I am no
more making this Tract a Defence of one
Party, than an Accu&s;ation of the other:
It has not been equally the Opinion of all
tho&s;e who were really out of the Mea|&s;ures
of the Mini&s;try, that they were Fa|vourers
of the Pretender; and much
might be &s;aid to prove they mu&s;t have
<PB N="13" REF="12">
been Ma&s;ters of very indifferent Politicks,
if they had any &s;uch Thoughts. It is
now out of the Que&s;tion; the Event
proves it otherwi&s;e; and tho&s;e Jacobites
who entertained Hopes of &s;uch a Thing,
di&s;cover that they little weigh'd the Na|ture
of the Settlement it &s;elf, which was
&s;uch, that the greate&s;t Friend to the Hou&s;e
of <HI>Hanover</HI> &s;carce knew what to Devi&s;e
for their farther Security, except the
placing &s;ome of the Family here, which
they found was not practicable on &s;eve|ral
Accounts.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed the&s;e things only to
make Room for what Follows, I begin
upon this reconciling Foundation. The
Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and the Doubts
and Fears concerning it, or concerning
who was for or again&s;t it, being then at
an End by the Succe&s;&s;or's being volunta|rily
and freely put into actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
(for the King tho' not yet pre&s;ent in his
proper Per&s;on, is yet in an actual and
legal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown.) This I
&s;ay being done, and being done even by
tho&s;e very Per&s;ons whom we have &s;o often
charged with being for the Preten|der,
what then remains but that we cea&s;e
that fooli&s;h &s;trife, forget the Wrongs
done to one another, and bury the Re|&s;entment
of pa&s;t Follies in the Joy of the
<PB N="14" REF="13">
pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, joining together
upon a di&s;intre&s;&s;ed Principle, to cultivate
our own Advantages.</P>
<P>This is our only pre&s;ent Security; if we
may be per&s;waded to this, we may pre|&s;erve
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown to the
Prote&s;tant Race of <HI>Hanover,</HI> again&s;t all
the World; if not, if we will divide
into Factions and Parties, and be &s;till tear|ing
one another to Pieces, the mo&s;t Con|temptible
of all Pretenders may give us
trouble, the con&s;tant Fears of it unea&s;i|ne&s;s,
and the lea&s;t Attempt from abroad
overcome and confound us.</P>
<P>It is hard to &s;ay what is now left for us
to Quarrel at: <HI>Mark &s;uch as &s;ow Divi&s;ions.</HI>
If any Man now would open Wounds,
and revive Party Di&s;&s;entions, what can
it be for, but to carry on a narrow Prin|ciple,
a private Intere&s;t, and make a
Gain of the Ruin of his Country?</P>
<P>The Succe&s;&s;ion is &s;ecured, and in that
our whole Demands are &s;ecured: In a
Prote&s;tant King, a Rightful, Lawful, Par|liamentary
<HI>Hanover</HI> King all we can
wi&s;h for is contained; the Prote&s;tant
Religion &s;ecured; the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
and the <HI>Kirk</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> Reciprocally
e&s;tabli&s;hed; the Toleration of Di&s;&s;enters
is contained in a temper of Moderation;
the Laws are protected; Liberty and Pro|perty
<PB N="15" REF="14">
engag'd for; Parliamentary Autho|rity
recogniz'd; every thing that was in
Danger is made &s;afe, that was in doubt
a&s;certain'd, that was di&s;puted, &s;ettled,
and nothing remains for us but for every
Man to <HI>Study to be quiet, and to do their
own Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>If any hot Man &s;hall object that this
is an Exhortation Politically made to
skreen Criminals from Ju&s;tice, and that
the late Management &s;hould be enquir'd
into and examined; I &s;ay, &s;uch a Man
&s;hows what manner of Spirit he is of.
But let him be the Man to accu&s;e, let
him name the Crime and the Criminal,
and let him be &s;ure to an&s;wer for a fal&s;e
Accu&s;ation, and begin if he thinks it is
nece&s;&s;ary; but then let Offenders of all
Parties have equal Ju&s;tice, and if they
can think of beginning the new Reign
in this Manner, let them go to Work
when they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>But is this a time for that Work, or
rather &s;ince Faults on every Side are to
be found, is it now our Bu&s;ine&s;s to re|concile
our &s;elves to one another, and
forget for one another the Cau&s;es of our
former Feuds, that we may not fall into
the like again.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
What a Stage of Parties, of Strife, of
Rage and Fury, &s;hall we make the Reign
of the King to be, if we go this way to
Work? How &s;hall we deprive His Ma|je&s;ty
of the Ble&s;&s;ing and Comfort of his
Subjects, and our &s;elves of the Ble&s;&s;ing
and Happine&s;s of his Protection and Fa|vour?
And make our &s;elves mi&s;erable
under that very Influence which we
thought to make us Happy.</P>
<P>Can we expect the King de&s;ires to be
King, of but part of his People? do we
think he comes in loaden with Re&s;ent|ment,
and that he will permit one half
of his People to fall upon the other, upon
the &s;ingle Que&s;tion of, who is, or is not
be&s;t affected to him, and mo&s;t in his In|tere&s;t?
That he &s;hould &s;et up an Inqui|&s;ition
upon the Conduct of Parties before
he was King, and a Retro&s;pect upon the
general Behaviour of the People when he
had nothing to do with them? Will he
begin to puni&s;h what his benign Prede|ce&s;&s;or
would not, and &s;hed that Blood
which &s;he would have &s;aved? OR on
the contrary, will his Maje&s;ty rather be
plea&s;ed that all Animo&s;ities and Prejudi|ces
&s;hould be bury'd in a general Chari|ty,
and all Party Offences laid a&s;leep in
an act of Oblivion, that his Subjects may
be ea&s;y, that none may tremble at his
<PB N="17" REF="16">
Coming, but that he may have the
Hearts and Hands of every Subject with
him, and may be the King of all his
Peoples Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>This leads me to the fir&s;t Important Que|&s;tion
mentioned in my Title, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>What
we are to expect from</HI> his Pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty.
Let me enquire of it Negatively.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have not Rea&s;on to expect in
his Pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty a raw Youth, unex|perienced
in the art of Government, that
knows not how or when to relax, or re|&s;train
the Humours of Parties, or to lead
the People he is to Govern; that mu&s;t give
up him&s;elf to be impos'd upon by his Coun|&s;ellors,
and knows not how, or where to
be&s;tow his Favours, or &s;hew his Di&s;like: I
am not complimenting his Maje&s;ty when I
tell you the King was not born Ye&s;ter|day,
nor is his Knowledge in the publick
Affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> to learn: He will indeed
be a Stranger in &s;ome of the Cu&s;toms
and U&s;ages of our Court, and Country,
to which he will &s;oon accommodate him|&s;elf;
but he is not a Stranger in the Of|fice
of a King; he has been a Soveraign
Prince many Years, and cannot be at a
Lo&s;s to know either his Office, or Duty;
and as he will know how to avoid failing
in his part, &s;o he will not be Ignorant
when we fail in Ours.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="18" REF="17">
2. Tho' his Maje&s;ty is a Prince of
known Benignity, and goodne&s;s of Di&s;|po&s;ition,
and Infinitely beloved by his
own Subjects, for his Lenity and Mode|ration,
even where his Power is ab&s;olute,
and where the Obedience of his People ri&s;es
up to a Degree that we would call Slave|ry;
yet I &s;ay we are not to expect his Ma|je&s;ty
will &s;uffer, as has been too much the
Ca&s;e in our two la&s;t Reigns, him&s;elf to
be trampled on, his Goodne&s;s and For|bearance
play'd upon and abu&s;ed, his
wi&s;e&s;t Mea&s;ures of Government ridi|cu'd,
his Councils &s;lighted and con|demned;
I believe his Maje&s;ty will give
us no Rea&s;on to do thus, and we ought
not to expect he will Patiently bear
it.</P>
<P N="3">3. We ought not to expect that upon
every Malecontent Party that may think
them&s;elves not kindly enough treated, or
that may be turned out of Place and Of|fice,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> as mu&s;t often be the Ca&s;e; we
may be permitted to Libel and In&s;ult
him? It is certainly the Neglect of this
part, even to a Fault, that has brought
our Pamphlets up to &s;uch a Degree of
Buffoonry, and &s;uch un&s;ufferable In&s;o|lence,
that no time in the Memory of
Man, or of Hi&s;tory, can &s;hew the like;
<PB N="19" REF="18">
and which the even Criminal Mercy of
her Maje&s;ty's Reign, in every Mini&s;try,
gave too much Encouragement to.</P>
<P>It is a &s;trange Ca&s;e, and owing to no|thing
but the loo&s;ene&s;s of the Rein, with
which our Princes have always go|vern'd;
that no &s;ooner has the Soveraign
here di&s;mi&s;s'd a Mini&s;ter of State or a &s;et
of Mini&s;ters of State, but tho&s;e Mini&s;ters
turn Malecontents again&s;t that Admini|&s;tration
they are di&s;mi&s;s'd from, lay wait
for the Mini&s;ters that &s;ucceed, Watch for
their halting, throw Dirt at them on all
Occa&s;ions, load their be&s;t Actions with
Scandal and Calumny, aggravate every
mi&s;take to a Degree of Crime, blacken
their Mea&s;ures with the Reproach of
both Folly and Knavery, and charge
them with Trea&s;onable De&s;igns again&s;t
the Liberties of their Country; in a
Word, &s;trive to render them odious and
burthem&s;ome to the People, that a popu|lar
cry being rai&s;ed again&s;t them, the
Soveraign may fir&s;t be la&s;t be obliged to
part with them; nor is this all, for altho'
this Re&s;entment be immediately levelled
at the Mini&s;ters of State, yet it always
Points at the Soveraign, nay, and
touches him too, &s;lily in&s;inuating either
his Incapacity to Govern, or his Indolence
<PB N="20" REF="19">
in Management, his being engro&s;s'd in a
Favourite, led blindly by the No&s;e, de|luded,
be&s;ieged, impo&s;ed upon, and the
like, all which tend to le&s;&s;en the Sove|raign
in the Eyes of the Subject, and bring
Government it &s;elf into Contempt.</P>
<P>Many ways this has been our Ca&s;e, in
the two former Reigns e&s;pecially, and
innumerable Mi&s;chiefs attend the Go|vernment
of this Nation from this one
beginning, and as all the&s;e have had the
greater Influence from the too great Le|nity
and Forbearance of the Soveraign,
giving way to the erecting Parties and
Factions in the Hou&s;hold and Court, &s;o
it is hoped we may &s;ay that we ought
not to expect his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty &s;hould
&s;ubject him&s;elf, and his Admini&s;tration,
to the &s;ame Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;omething of the Engli&s;h
Courts in former Reigns, and have ob|&s;erved
that when Mini&s;ters of State have
been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, it has not been as it is
now. If the Prince for Rea&s;ons of State
thought fit to di&s;mi&s;s his Servants, or to
change Hands in the Admini&s;tration of
his Affairs, the great Man di&s;mi&s;s'd, or
the &s;et of Men di&s;mi&s;t, &s;ubmitted; they
took it for a Misfortune to lo&s;e their
Princes Favour, and by a Mode&s;t and
<PB N="21" REF="20">
Dutiful Behaviour always &s;tood ready,
and expre&s;s'd their willingne&s;s to de&s;erve
the return of it: Far was it from &s;uch in
tho&s;e Days to demand Rea&s;ons why they
were di&s;mi&s;s'd, or to rai&s;e Parties a|gain&s;t
tho&s;e that came in; to undermine
them in their Stations, and bring the
Soveraign to the Nece&s;&s;ity of taking them
in again.</P>
<P>Neither did the new Servants ta|ken
in, fortify them&s;elves again&s;t tho&s;e
who were turned out, by endeavouring to
mi&s;repre&s;ent their former Conduct to the
Soveraign, or to le&s;&s;en them in the Eyes
of the People, and thereby to block up
the Way again&s;t their returning into
Bu&s;ine&s;s. But on the contrary, they were
always ready to do Bu&s;ine&s;s together in
what&s;oever Station of the Government
the Soveraign might be plea&s;ed to employ
them.</P>
<P>Nor was ever the changing Hands in
the Admini&s;tration till now, accounted
the changing a Party. Mini&s;ters of
State fell and ri&s;e &s;ingle, and alone, and
it was not found needful at the Change
of a Secretary, or of a Trea&s;urer, to
change Councils and Mea&s;ures, turn out
all the Inferior Officers in the Hou&s;hold
and Revenue, and even to all Officers,
<PB N="22" REF="21">
Civil and Military in the Kingdom,
changing Lieutenancies, removing Ju|&s;tices
of the Peace, and even in the very
Church, ob&s;erving the Party Intere&s;ts of
the Mini&s;ters of State, in placing Chap|lains,
making or tran&s;lating Bi&s;hops, and
the like.</P>
<P>This I mu&s;t confe&s;s Appears to me to
be a Foundation in the Government, of
&s;omething that &s;hould not be named,
and which in time if not redre&s;s'd, will
certainly bring all our Kings under Tute|lage,
and be fatal even to Monarchy it
&s;elf: How this &s;hall be redre&s;s'd, I am
not to dictate. All that I &s;ay to it here, is,
that I hope we will not expect &s;uch Pro|ceedings
under the Reign of his Pre&s;ent
Maje&s;ty, who as we believe of him, that
he Under&s;tands the Nature of Govern|ment
too well to confine him&s;elf to the
narrow Mea&s;ures of a Party, &s;o much le&s;s
can we rea&s;onably believe he will &s;uffer
him&s;elf to be <HI>governed by</HI> a PARTY;
which indeed would be fatal to him&s;elf,
and to us all.</P>
<P>4. No more are we to expect from his
Pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, that he will come into e|very
Party Re&s;entment, and gratify that
helli&s;h Pa&s;&s;ion of Revenge which &s;ome
People wi&s;h for, and which they think they
<PB N="23" REF="22">
owe to their late Mortifications: This
would be to make his Maje&s;ty a Party
Man again&s;t the Intere&s;t of his King|dom,
and again&s;t the Peace and Felicity
of his own Reign. His Maje&s;ty will
not appear Ignorant what to di&s;like, and
what to approve, what to re&s;ent, and
what to pa&s;s over. No doubt but many
People have taken Liberties in the prece|dent
Reign, which they would not
have taken had his Maje&s;ty been upon
the Throne, it was ever &s;o in every
Reign: If the Re&s;entment of the Succe&s;|&s;or
were to be pu&s;h'd at the&s;e Things, as
the Re&s;entment of Parties would pu&s;h
them, many People might be made unea|&s;y,
who for the future may perhaps be|come
Loyal and Faithful; and many
People may be undone, who&s;e Ruin &s;hall
not add one Grain to the Safety or Hap|pine&s;s
of his Maje&s;ty's Reign. I am
per&s;waded every Jacobite that behaves
quietly and inoffen&s;ively under his Maje|&s;ty,
may yet hope for the &s;ame Security
and Protection which he enjoy'd under
King <HI>William,</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne.</HI></P>
<P>There is no Que&s;tion but many a Ja|cobite
will by &s;uch a merciful Admini|&s;tration
be in time reduced to his Duty,
who by the Violence of Re&s;entment
<PB N="24" REF="23">
would be continued in Enmity, and per|haps
be made de&s;perate. Here let it be
ob&s;erved that by Jacobite I am to be
under&s;tood a quiet pa&s;&s;ive Jack, not an
intreaguing, ploting, bu&s;y turbulent Jaco|bite;
let &s;uch receive the due de&s;ert of
their Folly, and whoever breaks the
Peace of his Maje&s;ty's Reign, let him
neither claim or receive any Mercy.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty is a King, and not a private
Man, and when he is &s;uppo&s;ed to Practi&s;e
the great Vertue of Moderation it is &s;up|po&s;ed
he will Practi&s;e it as a King; that
is to &s;ay, that it &s;hall be exten&s;ive, <HI>God|like</HI>
to every Penitent, giving room to
Men to forget the Rancour of their
Spirits, and forbearing to take Advan|tages
of the Folly and Blindne&s;s of his
Subjects. If we pretend to expect Puni&s;h|ment,
and the Extremity of the Law upon
every weak Man who has been drawn in
to offend again&s;t the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;i|on,
you will make the King's Reign,
which we hope to &s;ee Mild and Merciful,
turn'd into a general Judicature, and all
his Enemies that would not, that he
&s;hould Reign over them, &s;lain before
him: A &s;ight which I dare &s;ay his Maje&s;ty's
generous Heart would abhor, and which
might make him terrible, but would
<PB N="25" REF="24">
never make him dear to the Briti&s;h Na|tion.</P>
<P>If
the Jacobites, who &s;hall behave
Quietly and Dutifully to the King, have
thus nothing to expect that is terrible,
much le&s;s will any other of his Maje&s;ty's
Subjects who&s;e Crimes are not &s;uch as
call for Ju&s;tice from the Nation as a ci|vil
Society. But all his Maje&s;ty's Sub|jects
are as it were put upon their Be|haviour,
and have room given to te&s;tify
their Loyalty and Fidelity, whether &s;u&s;|pected
or no by their future Conduct.</P>
<P>And this Brings me to the other part
of my Subject, (<HI>viz.</HI>) how we ought to
behave to the <HI>King upon his Coming among
us.</HI></P>
<P>A general An&s;wer might &s;uffice for this
(<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>like good Subjects,</HI> Faithfully, Loy|ally
with Obedience and Affection; and
like good Chri&s;tians living under him
quiet and peaceable Lives, in all Godli|ne&s;s
and Hone&s;ty: But this is not &s;peak|ing
exten&s;ively to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, nor
giving &s;ufficient Directions to the People
how to regulate their Conduct &s;o as may
di&s;charge their Duty as Subjects, and en|gage
the Soveraign, whom God and the
Laws have &s;et over them, to Rule them
not as a King only with Authority and
<PB N="26" REF="25">
Ju&s;tice, but as a Father of his Country,
and of his People, with Tenderne&s;s and
Affection.</P>
<P>I pay no Compliment to his Maje&s;ty
when I pre&s;ume to &s;ay he comes over eve|ry
way qualified both by natural Di&s;po&s;i|tion,
and premeditated Re&s;olution to treat
us with all that Clemency, Lenity, Ten|derne&s;s
and Moderation that we can
de&s;ire: It is our immediate Duty, as Sub|jects,
to apply our &s;elves to merit that
Benign Carriage, to engage him to us,
and to give him no cau&s;e to think his
Affection to all his Subjects ill placed.</P>
<P>And that this Exhortation may be ef|fectual
in general to us all, I take the Li|berty
to begin with the Jacobites: The&s;e,
I divide into Originals, and New Con|verts
I have that Charity for the&s;e la&s;t,
as to believe they have been drawn into
Jacobiti&s;m, rather from their being per|&s;waded
to believe its Succe&s;s was certain,
and infallible, and that they &s;hould &s;o
recommend them&s;elves to the next turn,
than from any particular Conviction of
the Invalidity of Parliamentary Settle|ment,
or of the &s;uperior Right of the
Pretender. Their &s;lip is pardonable no
doubt on two Conditions. 1. That they
have committed no overt Act which
<PB N="27" REF="26">
amounting to Trea&s;on, renders it ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary to reduce them not to
Obedience, but to Example: and 2.)
That they immediately re&s;olve to return
to their fir&s;t Principles, and te&s;tify their
&s;incere Repentance by a Con&s;tant &s;ted|dy
Loyalty to the pre&s;ent King, till by
the length of time they may be natura|lized
in their Obedience, and it may be
as ju&s;t to forget their Offence as it would
be now to puni&s;h it.</P>
<P>Certainly no Man that entertains the
lea&s;t Zeal for his Country can now wi&s;h,
had he no other Motive to &s;ee all the&s;e
Calamities brought upon it which an at|tempt
for the Pretender mu&s;t now In|volve
it in: If the Jacobite Cau&s;e was
de&s;perate before, as to thinking Men was
apparent, it mu&s;t be nothing but Lunacy
and Euthu&s;ia&s;m to entertain any Expe|ctation
of its Succe&s;s now. From whence
it &s;eems ju&s;t to conclude now, that he
who Joyns in an Attempt for the Preten|der
at this time cannot be thought to do
it &s;o much with an Eye to the Succe&s;s, as
to the immediate Plunder of a War, that
he may Fi&s;h in the troubled Water, and
catch up &s;ome trifle out of the Ruins of
his Country. This is one of the wor&s;t
&s;ort of Incendiaries, who &s;ets a Hou&s;e on
<PB N="28" REF="27">
Fire purely and on purpo&s;e to rob the
di&s;ordered Inhabitants when they are in
a Hurry and Con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>Now I can not think any of the&s;e new
Converts or &s;econd-hand Jacobites, for
&s;uch they are, can yet be &s;o far advanced
as to &s;eek the Confu&s;ion of their Country
upon &s;o vile a Con&s;ideration as that of
&s;haring the Ruins I have therefore no|thing
to &s;ay to &s;uch, but to let them &s;ee
their Ca&s;e is de&s;perate and irretrievable, and
they will &s;oon &s;ee what is the next &s;tep
they have to take.</P>
<P>As to original Jacobites Nonjurant, Pro|fe&s;t,
and openly &s;o, who were &s;o from the
beginning of Jacobiti&s;m it &s;elf, I can only
&s;ay to &s;uch, <HI>be it with you according as you
behave,</HI> I have here no room for farther
Di&s;cour&s;e with you.</P>
<P>That the Ca&s;e of Jacobiti&s;m is now
de&s;parate, we need but little Argument
to per&s;wade them to, if Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion be 11
Points of the Law, 'tis yet more &s;o of
the Throne; and I need go no farther to
Convince you of it than this. It was not
long ago when a great Man in the <HI>French</HI>
Armies laid it down as a Fundamental in
this very Ca&s;e, that King <HI>James</HI> could
never be re&s;tored in <HI>England</HI> by the
Sword, but that it mu&s;t be done by
<PB N="29" REF="28">
dividing the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> and ma|king
way for them to bring him in
them&s;elves. This was publi&s;h'd after|wards
in a Paper called the <HI>Doway Letter.</HI></P>
<P>I am willing to take it for granted either
way, as the Jacobites plea&s;e: If the Inte|re&s;t
of Jacobiti&s;m be re&s;tored by Ma|nagement
at home, they need no more
than to con&s;ult their own Rea&s;on; and
&s;ee if they can tell them&s;elves where their
pro&s;pect lies: They had the Folly and
Simplicity to flatter them&s;elves that they
were in a Way for it lately, imagining
tho' again&s;t all common Sence, that the
Mini&s;try were in their Intere&s;t. Their
Zeal for the Pretender made them blind,
and though there were a Thou&s;and De|mon&s;trations,
that they were only dup'd
and made Tools of, to &s;erve the pre&s;ent
occa&s;ion of the Mini&s;try without the lea&s;t
thought of doing any thing for them as
they called it, yet &s;o willing were they to
believe what they &s;o weakly, though
earne&s;tly, hoped for, that they &s;hut, out all
ju&s;t Su&s;pitions from their Under&s;tandings
and acted with the Mini&s;try as if the
Mini&s;try had acted with them.</P>
<P>But when the thing came to the Te&s;t,
when Heaven took the Work into his
own Hands, by removing her late Ma|e&s;ty,
<PB N="30" REF="29">
then it appeared how they were
mi&s;taken, that they had been only made
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ools of, to &s;erve a turn with, and that
for the Intere&s;t of the Pretender, was
no part of the Project.</P>
<P>If then there was no real De&s;ign in their
Favour before, no Body will be &s;o weak
to &s;uppo&s;e they are in a better State
now, and therefore I may be allowed to
&s;ay the Ca&s;e of Jacobiti&s;m is now grown
de&s;parate as to the Art and Management
of Parties at home; and as to its being
propogated by Force from abroad, that
I believe the Jacobites them&s;elves have
de&s;pair'd of long ago</P>
<P>This being the Ca&s;e, and Jacobiti&s;m
being effectually &s;uppre&s;s'd, what have
we to do with any other Divi&s;ions? What
Bone of Contention is left among us?</P>
<P>We have nothing to do then, but to
Unite in a general Behaviour of Duty
and Affection, and laying a&s;ide the Me|mory
of former Breache,s let the King
have their Services and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
whole Nation, give him leave to be King
of ALL his People, give him room to
make u&s;e of ALL their help, to po&s;&s;e&s;s
all their Hearts, and have the Strength
of all their Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30">
There are two principal Articles which
have been the Cau&s;es, or at lea&s;t have
been given as the Rea&s;ons, of all our
Parties, and of all the Divi&s;ions that have
ever happened in this Nation; and
which as they would be effectually taken
away by this Unity and Agreement of
the Nation in their Behaviour to his pre|&s;ent
Maje&s;ty: So if any Contention or
Strife happened among us after it, the
World would plainly &s;ee it was a wick|ed
De&s;ign to undermine the Govern|ment,
and di&s;turb the publick Peace, and
with any ju&s;t Foundation, the&s;e two
Articles are; 1. The Danger of the
Pretender. 2. The Danger of the Church:
both the&s;e I &s;ay would be taken away in
a Firm and re&s;olved Loyalty, and Affe|ction
to the King, his powerful Hand
&s;trengthened by the Affections of his
People to him, and they made invincible
by their Union, with one another, would
&s;ecure us again&s;t the fir&s;t, and his Zeal
for the Pre&s;ervation of their Right, in all
its Parts would prevent the Apprehen&s;i|ons
of the la&s;t.</P>
<P>In his Maje&s;ty's Zeal for the publick
Good, and watchful concern for its Safe|ty,
all Danger from Enemies abroad, or
from Parties at home will be taken away,
<PB N="32" REF="31">
all State Jealou&s;ies bury'd, and all Party
Animo&s;ities bury'd. The Danger of the
Pretender will be lo&s;t, the very Remem|brance
of it will dye, a brave and a mag|naimous
Prince at the Head of an uni|ted
Nation can leave us no room for Ap|prehen&s;ions,
nor the Friends of the Pre|tender
any room for Hope: Popery, and
Jacobiti&s;m mu&s;t no more &s;hew their
Faces, or have the lea&s;t Pretences for their
Cau&s;e; let them make what Efforts they
can, they will be Laught at by the World:
Not the Power of the <HI>French,</HI> or of the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchies, whether united or
not United, can give us any Unea&s;ine&s;s
in that part; we &s;hall be always ready,
and always able to Encounter them.</P>
<P>No more can that other Amu&s;ement,
<HI>the Danger of the Church,</HI> have any Foun|dation
among us, unle&s;s it be founded in
Parties and Divi&s;ions; which Parties and
Divi&s;ions will bring in all the Mi&s;chiefs of
the former Reign, and make his Maje|&s;ty's
Days as unhappy and uncomforta|ble
as tho&s;e of his Predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>But this general Union of Affections
would remove all Jealou&s;ies, prevent that
State Plague of governing by Parties, it
would di&s;&s;olve Te&s;ts and occa&s;ional Bills
upon the Arms of the Government, to
<PB N="33" REF="32">
Embrace all its Subjects with an equal
Affection; and open the Heart of the
governed to &s;uch a Faithful and Affectio|nate
Behaviour, that every &s;ort of Men
being true Lovers of the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Go|vernment,
could not be capable of any
De&s;igns to its Prejudice.</P>
<P>This is the Moderation I am recom|mending,
and this alone. I am not plead|ing
to cover any Man whom Ju&s;tice ought
to puni&s;h, let the Law have its Cour&s;e
upon all; let none mi&s;take me. But if
we would make the Nation and the King
Happy, enable his Maje&s;ty to Rule
Happily and Gloriou&s;ly, we mu&s;t re&s;olve
to bury this Party temper, this Spirit of
Animo&s;ity and Envy that is among us; to
be one ea&s;y People under the Reign of
one Glorious King.</P>
<P>I can mo&s;t plainly perceive that there
are a &s;et of People who begin to move
among us already with the &s;ame Spirit
which has ruined us, as to our Peace, once
or twice before, who not knowing <HI>what
Spirit they are of,</HI> begin already to be <HI>Cal|ling
for Fire from Heaven;</HI> and will think
they are highly injur'd, and re&s;ent it e|ven
again&s;t a new Admini&s;tration, if their
Party Re&s;entments are out aveng'd on
tho&s;e who they &s;ingle out for Objects of
Ju&s;tice, as they call it; and if the King
<PB N="34" REF="33">
does not immediately fall upon all tho&s;e
that they &s;hall take upon them to call
Enemies of the Succe&s;&s;ion whether it
were really &s;o, or no.</P>
<P>In their &s;everal Pamphlets which they
continue to publi&s;h upon that Head, they
are already whetting the Edge of the po|pular
Temper, and &s;ugge&s;ting that tho&s;e
People who contrary to former Re|proaches,
appear to be heartily in the In|tere&s;t
of the Pre&s;ent King only feign to
be &s;o.</P>
<P>As to the general Con&s;ent of all Peo|ple,
as well in the Mini&s;try as out of it,
to proclaim the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;or, they
&s;ay it was not in the Power of any to
with&s;tand it; that the Acts of Parliament
had made &s;uch effectual Provi&s;ion to &s;ettle
an immediate Admini&s;tration, and that
in &s;uch Hands as were certain to put that
Settlement in Execution; and had added
&s;uch &s;evere Penalties for the lea&s;t delay,
or neglect of Duty in that Ca&s;e, that no
Man could &s;tir in Favour of a contrary
Intere&s;t; and therefore they found them|&s;elves
under a Nece&s;&s;ity of falling in with
the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, lea&s;t they &s;hould
be fallen upon by the whole Admini&s;tra|tion
who found them&s;elves ve&s;ted with
all the Military and Civil Authority, the
Executive Power &s;uffering no Interval of
its Authority.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34">
How much this Ju&s;tifies tho&s;e People
who could not &s;ay with the general Opi|nion
that the Danger of the Succe&s;&s;ion
was &s;o great before, as was &s;ugge&s;ted,
tho' it might be very material to the clear|ing
up the Hone&s;ty of the Per&s;ons, yet
as I know it is a String which tho&s;e I am
now &s;peaking of do not care to have
touch'd, I therefore purpo&s;ely omit.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t take leave to &s;ay, that ma|ny
who did not go along with the late
Gentlemen in all their Warmth again&s;t
the Mini&s;try, were yet as Sincere Friends to
the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, as they, and Em|brac'd
as heartily the Intere&s;t of his Pre&s;ent
Maje&s;ty as they; and it will never pre|vail
with his Maje&s;ty to condemn
all tho&s;e as his Enemies, that did not
&s;ee the &s;ame Rea&s;on to Quarrel with the
Admini&s;tration of his Predece&s;&s;or as other
Men did.</P>
<P>While I am &s;aying this, and to avoid
the Reproach which the&s;e Men are alrea|dy
rai&s;ing, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that this is to prevent
Puni&s;hment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I give up at once every
Man to them who the Law without Par|tiality,
without Party-Ju&s;tice, without
&s;training Facts by Innuendoes will fairly
and clearly condemn. Let them proceed
and take what Mea&s;ures Legally can be
taken.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35">
But the Moderation I in&s;i&s;t upon is,
that no Man be condemn'd by Clamour
cen&s;ur'd fir&s;t by Party, and then &s;entenc'd
by Tumult; that Prejudices be laid a&s;ide,
and the general FEUD of Parties laid

the debate about who was for, or

again&s;t it, may dye, that Men may no
more be made Offenders for a Word, and
be judg'd by Negatives, that they were
NOT &s;o, and &s;o, and did NOT do &s;o,
and &s;o.</P>
<P>If any Men are Criminal, bring them
forth, we are not &s;peaking, I &s;ay, of &s;uf|fering
Criminals to E&s;cape, but of not
making Innocent Men Criminal, whether
they will or no, and keeping a Breach
open in our Charity, becau&s;e Men will
not be of our Opinion in Matters of State;
if the&s;e Men think they can hurt tho&s;e
Men by Law, who they Condemn by
the Tongue, let it be done; if nothing
el&s;e will &s;atisfy them, let them try their
Hands with Impeachments and Per&s;ecu|tions
for Male Admini&s;tration, and let
them go back what length they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>This I &s;ay again is far from the De&s;ign
of this Di&s;cour&s;e, I ask no Forbearance,
no Indempnity for Men who are abnoxi|ous
<PB N="37" REF="36">
to Puni&s;hment from the Law, they
that would take &s;uch an Advantage of a
per&s;wa&s;ive to Peace and Moderation &s;hall
be defeated in it by this Challenge. We
know that too much Mercy was never
the Sin of that Party of Men we &s;peak
of. Let them do what they think they
can do by Ju&s;tice, if they think they have
&s;o great an Advantage in their Hands.</P>
<P>But where the Law is not concern'd,
where no Breaches of Con&s;titution, no
Oppre&s;&s;ions, no Guilt is concerned, there
let them tell us a Rea&s;on why Moderati|on,
Charity, and a Chri&s;tian Friendly
Reconciliation of Parties, and an Oblivion
of that wicked Spirit of Rancour and
Malice, may not take Place among us.
WHY having the main Article of our
Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion &s;ecured, our Reli|gion,
Liberties, and Properties e&s;tabli&s;hed,
and all under the Protection of God, and
a Prote&s;tant King, we may not join toge|ther
to make that Prote&s;tant King Great
and Glorious, his Days Happy, and his
Reign Comfortable; none of which can
be, if we will not with a full Con&s;ent of
all Parties Unite in his Intere&s;t, and in
our own. If we will not be at Peace with
one another, what Peace can be expected
for the King? How &s;hall his Maje&s;ty be
the Common Father of a Nation, tearing
<PB N="38" REF="37">
one another to Pieces, and endeavouring to
Supplant one another in Intere&s;t, expo&s;e one
another in Character, and accu&s;e one another
of Crimes never committed.</P>
<P>If we will not do this, if we will not drop
the Party Quarrel, forget the Animo&s;ities and
Heats we have fooli&s;hly run into, we &s;hall
all fall into Parties and Di&s;tractions again as
much as ever, which a true Lover of his Coun|try
would tremble to think on. I cannot for|get
that I have often heard Men, who&s;e tone
yet I have ob&s;erved to be a little alter'd &s;ince,
I &s;ay I have often heard Men talk thus to one
another.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I care not what they do &s;o the Prote&s;tant
Succe&s;&s;ion be but &s;ecur'd: I have nothing to
do with <HI>who is in,</HI> or <HI>who is out,</HI> what Mi|ni&s;try
the Queen Employs, or what &s;he
turns out, let but our Liberties and Reli|gion
be &s;afe, and let them but keep out the
Pretender, and we have no more to &s;ay."</Q></P>
<P>I cannot but throw the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es in the
Way of &s;ome People at this time, thus; <HI>SIR,
We</HI> hope all you de&s;ired is now obtained, all
your demands an&s;wered. The Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ion
has taken Place, the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;|&s;or
is in full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the whole Kingdom
&s;eems to join with one Heart, and one Voice,
to Congratulate him, and to join together in
their Allegiance to him, what is the matter
with you that you are Not &s;atisfi'd now? What
more would you have? Would you have us all
Quarrel again about who is <HI>Sincere,</HI> and who
Feigns? Whoever Feigns dare not own his Di&s;|content,
and perhaps in time will give it over.
Shall we Quarrel, becau&s;e we do not think
<PB N="39" REF="38">
every Body as earne&s;t as we are our &s;elves!
This would be to fall out for the &s;ake of fal|ling
out. This would be really, and in good
Earne&s;t to <HI>&s;ow Divi&s;ions;</HI> and depend upon it, if
you <HI>&s;ow Iniquity, you will reap Vanity;</HI> if you &s;ow
Divi&s;ions, Divi&s;ions will grow, you will have
a large Crop of Strife and Contention, Vexa|tion
and Perplexity, and we &s;hall &s;till be a mi|&s;erable
divided Nation, we &s;hlal have no Com|fort
of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, and the Pro|te&s;tant
Succe&s;&s;or will have little Comfort in us.</P>
<P>The Sum of this Di&s;cour&s;e, and the true
De&s;ign of the Author of it, is to recommend
to the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> to con&s;ider their pre|&s;ent
Circum&s;tances, to rea&s;&s;ume that Temper,
Moderation and Spirit of Union among them|&s;elves,
which has always been a Token to them
of approaching Deliverance. This is now the
only Cour&s;e left them, and in the pur&s;uit of
this, they can not fail of a generous A&s;&s;i&s;tance
from all Men that wi&s;h well to the Publick.</P>
<P>I know the hot Men of every &s;ide will op|po&s;e
this, and &s;ome will make this u&s;e of it;
that as there is now a Breach made, their Bu|&s;ine&s;s
is to make the A&s;&s;ault; as the <HI>Turks</HI> at
the Siege of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> when, by Accident or
Treachery, or what other means is not known,
they found the Walls and Works of the City
all blown up on a &s;uddain, they immediately
advanced to the Storm.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who are of that Opinion in the
pre&s;ent Ca&s;e con&s;ider, that they make the Ex|periment
at the hazard of their Country, and
that as a Mi&s;carriage will endanger not the
Publick only, but them&s;elves al&s;o, &s;o let them
remember that whoever Pu&s;hes his private
<PB N="40" REF="39">
De&s;ign at the Hazard of the publick Peace,
&s;hews that he Values his Country le&s;s than his
&s;ingle Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But what is it the&s;e Men call breaking in?
Breaking in upon Moderation, and upon Peace,
is making War upon your &s;elves. The Support
and Pre&s;ervation of our Country's Intere&s;t
Depends upon a Steady, Wi&s;e, and Calm Ad|mini&s;tration,
not &s;traightned by the narrow
Mea&s;ures of Parties; for Government is above
Parties, and ought to be pre&s;erv'd in its ju&s;t
Superiority to all private De&s;igns; the only
Limits of Government are the Laws, and the
only end of Government is the publick Good.</P>
<P>The time is now come for us, all to act
with a new Spirit, the War is over, <HI>let the
Spears be turned into pruning Hooks,</HI> let the
Rage abate, for the Conte&s;t is at an End, let
us <HI>Study to be Quiet, and do our own Bu&s;ine&s;s;</HI> if
any Man would &s;ow Divi&s;ion, let us <HI>Mark that
Man,</HI> and have no Communication with him.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e who have offended, <HI>who</HI> as above
<HI>I freely give up,</HI> if the Law can take hold of
any, <HI>it is open,</HI> any one may have Recour&s;e
to it. I doubt not his Maje&s;ty comes in
with a temper of Clemency, and as <HI>SA&V;L,</HI>
when he was proclaimed King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when
the Party-men would have had him re&s;ent|ed
the Conduct of tho&s;e who would not have
had him <HI>to have reigned over him;</HI> if even any
offending Jacobite is found, that Text and Ex|ample
recommends them, <HI>if Penite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> to his
Maje&s;ty's Royal Mercy. 1. Sam. 11. 13. <HI>And</HI>
SAUL <HI>&s;aid, there &s;hould not a Man be put to
Death this Day, for to Day the</HI> LORD <HI>hath
wrought Salvation in</HI> I&s;rael.</P>
