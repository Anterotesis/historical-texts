<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the <HI>Fraud</HI> made u&s;e of by <HI>In&s;olvents</HI> to bring them&s;elves within the Reach of the Acts of <HI>Parliament,</HI> with &s;ome Limitations; humbly offered to be con|&s;idered of, in order (not to prevent an Act of Favour to real <HI>In&s;olvents,</HI> but) to prevent the Abu&s;e of it by im|proper Objects.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is no wonder, if after &s;o many Pe|titions from the &s;everal Pri&s;ons almo&s;t over the whole Kingdom, and &s;uch horrid <HI>Cruelties</HI> and Inhumanities, as appears to have been practi&s;ed by &s;ome Jai|lors, e&s;pecially by the <HI>Warden of the Fleet</HI> and his <HI>Agents,</HI> upon &s;everal unfortunate Gentlemen who have fallen into their Hands; I &s;ay, 'tis no wonder if a Bill for Relief of Pri&s;oners is become very popular.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">By how much the ill U&s;age of the Pri&s;o|ners, who are thus abu&s;ed by the <HI>Keepers of Pri&s;ons,</HI> &s;hocks the tender and charitable Part in every Man's Brea&s;t; by &s;o much the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Pri&s;oners,</HI> even of tho&s;e who have not been u&s;ed ill, prevails upon the <HI>Publick</HI> in favour of the GRACE de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall one Word be &s;aid, or one Thought &s;ugge&s;ted, in this Tract in Preju|dice of the <HI>Charitable</HI> Intention of the Hou&s;e, or any way to le&s;&s;en the good and generous Di&s;po&s;ition of any Per&s;on whatever, whether in the Legi&s;lature, or out of it, to|wards promoting &s;o good a Work.</P>
<P><HI>Far le&s;s</HI> &s;hall I take one Step, or &s;peak one Word, that &s;o much as looks like a Plea for the <HI>Cruelty</HI> and Inhumanity of <HI>Jaylors</HI> and Pri&s;on-keepers; their Conduct in mo&s;t, if not in all the Jails in <HI>England,</HI> calls aloud for a like In&s;pection of Authority and for Ju&s;tice upon the Per&s;ons, as well as a &s;evere Cen&s;ure of the Practi&s;es of the Delinquents, in order to have that rigid, tho' nece&s;&s;ary Part of the Law, call'd <HI>Impri&s;onment for Debt,</HI> be executed with <HI>Humanity</HI> and with Equity, according to the natural Rights of the Unfortunate, as Men; and according to
<PB N="3" REF="6">
their <HI>legal</HI> Rights as <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> which it is evident has not been ob&s;erv'd hitherto.</P>
<P>And to conclude this Part; <HI>lea&s;t of all</HI> &s;hall I &s;ay one Word here in behalf of the Per&s;ons at this time detected openly in the <HI>Cruelties,</HI> Inhumanities and Extortions, which they have practis'd upon the unhap|py Gentlemen who have fallen into their Hands: I do not &s;ee they merit the lea&s;t <HI>Favour</HI> from their Country; they have acted a <HI>dreadful Part,</HI> and they are in Hands, which I doubt not will have more <HI>Mercy</HI> than they have &s;hewn to the Mi&s;erable, who have been under their Power; and tho' I &s;hall not, on the other hand, prompt or pu&s;h their <HI>Misfortune,</HI> yet this I may &s;ay without any Prejudice or Injury to them, that I hope they &s;hall have &s;uch Ju&s;tice, as will effectually di&s;able them, and warn all others (of that <HI>rough</HI> Employment) from the <HI>like</HI> Practices.</P>
<P>Having laid down the&s;e <HI>Po&s;tulata,</HI> in or|der to prevent any prejudging my De&s;ign in this Work, or rai&s;ing a <HI>popular</HI> Clamour, as if it was intended to le&s;&s;en the intended <HI>Grace</HI> of the Government or Legi&s;lature, and to prevent the <HI>Deliverance</HI> of Pri&s;oners; I &s;hall with the more freedom lay down &s;ome Dif|ficulties,
<PB N="4" REF="7">
which, as they occur to me on this Occa&s;ion, &s;hall be worth the Con&s;ideration of the Legi&s;lature, not to lye as <HI>Ob&s;tructions</HI> in the way of the intended Bill, as a Rea&s;on <HI>&s;ine qua non,</HI> but that the Parliament, taking them into their Hands, and <HI>approving</HI> or <HI>di&s;approving</HI> them, as they &s;hall appear <HI>im|portant,</HI> may find out &s;uch <HI>proper Remedies</HI> as to their great Wi&s;dom &s;hall &s;eem meet.</P>
<P>Having thus, as I hope, remov'd the Prejudices which might lye again&s;t my pre|&s;ent De&s;ign, I mu&s;t al&s;o &s;peak a Word or two, very briefly, to remove if po&s;&s;ible a popular Objection (at lea&s;t as it is u&s;ed in the Mouths of &s;ome who are more particu|cularly concern'd in that part) namely, that it is <HI>unchri&s;tian</HI> and inhuman, and incon&s;i&s;t|ent with a <HI>generous</HI> Nation abhorring Cruel|ty, as <HI>England</HI> profe&s;&s;es to be, to confine poor mi&s;erable People in <HI>Pri&s;on</HI> for Debt, e&s;pecially &s;uch as have nothing to pay.</P>
<P>As to the latter Part, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>confining</HI> People in Pri&s;on who have <HI>nothing</HI> to pay, I come readily into that part, and in doing &s;o I confirm what I have &s;aid above, that I am not writing in order to intercept the in|tended <HI>Grace</HI> of the Parliament to the <HI>Un|fortunate.</HI> The hone&s;t Debtor willing to
<PB N="5" REF="8">
pay, but <HI>unable</HI>; and willing to pay as far as he is <HI>able,</HI> and ready to give all rea&s;ona|ble Satisfaction, &s;uch as the Parliament may direct, that he is &s;o unable, is certainly an <HI>Object</HI> recommending it &s;elf to the <HI>Charity</HI> and Compa&s;&s;ion of the whole Nation; and whatever intervenes by the Fraud of others, the&s;e, and the&s;e only, are allow'd to be the Per&s;ons for whom the <HI>Parliamentary Grace</HI> which has been &s;ettled, and extended in &s;o many Acts of Parliament already pa&s;s'd, has been <HI>intended.</HI></P>
<P>That very great Numbers of <HI>Fraudulent,</HI> unqualify'd, wicked, and di&s;hone&s;t People have formerly receiv'd the Benefit of the like <HI>Grace</HI> by the Help of <HI>fal&s;e Oaths,</HI> unju&s;t Pre|tences, Connivance of Jailors, Bribery and Corruption of many kinds, has been loudly complain'd of, and I doubt is much ea&s;ier to prove than to prevent; and not being wil|ling, as I have &s;aid, to be any ways a Hin|drance to the Relief of the <HI>hone&s;t</HI> and real Objects of <HI>Grace,</HI> who are indeed within the Intention of the Act, I cover all that Part with &s;aying, Better <HI>Ten</HI> di&s;hone&s;t Debtors <HI>e&s;cape,</HI> than that <HI>one</HI> real Object of the in|tended <HI>Good</HI> &s;hould <HI>peri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9">Yet I humbly propo&s;e it, as a Thing worthy the Con&s;ideration of the <HI>Briti&s;h Par|liament,</HI> whether it is any Way probable, that there can be &s;uch a Number of mi&s;er|able In&s;olvents in one Year, and that of but the <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> Cla&s;s too; namely, not owing above 100<HI>l.</HI> to any one Per&s;on, and all act|ually Pri&s;oners, as have pre&s;ented them&s;elves yearly to the Magi&s;trates, to be di&s;charged by the <HI>Grace</HI> of Parliament, for the&s;e &s;eve|ral Years pa&s;t?</P>
<P>If it is true, as common <HI>Fame</HI> &s;ays it is, that notwith&s;tanding there was an Act for Delivering &s;uch <HI>Pri&s;oners</HI> but <HI>two</HI> Years pa&s;t, there are at this Time near ninety Thou|&s;and &s;uch <HI>In&s;olvents,</HI> now on the Books of the &s;everal <HI>Jails</HI> in this Kingdom; I &s;ay, if this is <HI>true,</HI> is it rational to believe, that the&s;e are all really and fairly Pri&s;oners, with|in the Intent and Meaning of the <HI>intended Grace.</HI></P>
<P>It would be a noble Undertaking, and in my Opinion well worth the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, tho' it took up a good Part of a <HI>Se&s;&s;ion,</HI> to find out &s;ome effectual Means to <HI>&s;eparate between the Sheep and the Goats,</HI> (&s;peaking of that Allu&s;ion with due Regard) in this Ca&s;e; and to di&s;cover, expo&s;e, and
<PB N="7" REF="10">
puni&s;h the <HI>Frauds</HI> which are put upon the NATION in this Affair.</P>
<P>It is true, the People are de&s;picable; I mean, the <HI>Guilty</HI>; the Debts they lye for not large, at lea&s;t not to particular Men, and &s;ome may &s;ugge&s;t that it is not worth Notice; but I reply, the Number is great, &s;urprizingly great, and the Injury to Trade is very <HI>con&s;iderable,</HI> nor is the Matter &s;mall among <HI>Trade&s;men,</HI> tho' the Debts (as above) are not &s;ingly large. For as many of the&s;e <HI>In&s;olvents</HI> frequently fall within the Compa&s;s of one and the &s;ame Shopkeeper, it very of|ten falls heavy; and as the&s;e <HI>fraudulent</HI> Debtors boldly run into Mens Books, with a Dependance upon &s;uch <HI>Acts of Grace,</HI> and with an evident De&s;ign to cheat and defraud their Creditors, and this <HI>&s;everal</HI> Times over, &s;uch People are, I think, very far from be|ing Debtors who de&s;erve Compa&s;&s;ion, or within the Intent and Meaning of the <HI>Par|liamentary</HI> Grace.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e they are greatly injurious to Trade in general, as they <HI>ruin innocent</HI> Trade&s;men by their Knavery; many Trade&s;|men having had thirty to fifty &s;uch In&s;olvents di&s;charged by <HI>one Act,</HI> tho' they were never
<PB N="8" REF="11">
put in Pri&s;on, or &s;o much ar arre&s;ted at their Suit, or for any Part of their Debt.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual <HI>Practice</HI> of the&s;e People has been to run them&s;elves into the <HI>Trade&s;mens Books,</HI> as it is called, in as many particular and different Places as po&s;&s;ible; always tak|ing Care that it be for &s;mall Sums, within the u&s;ual Re&s;traint of the <HI>Acts of Grace</HI>; and then when the expected <HI>Favour</HI> is in Pro&s;pect, get them&s;elves arre&s;ted, and put in Pri&s;on, or turn'd over by <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> &s;o to be within the Reach of the Law, and then all the other <HI>Creditors,</HI> who have never offered them the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> Violence, are paid with a SUMMONS.</P>
<P>Others by <HI>Corruption</HI> of Jailors, and by <HI>Bribery,</HI> have obtained tho&s;e Jailors to own them as <HI>Pri&s;oners in Cu&s;tody,</HI> tho' not <HI>really</HI> &s;o, for a certain antedated Time, &s;o as to be brought within the Reach of the Act.</P>
<P>What <HI>Perjury,</HI> what <HI>Forgery,</HI> what foul Things are practi&s;ed under this Head, de|&s;erves the In&s;pection of the like Authority as lately detected the <HI>Frauds</HI> of the <HI>Fleet-pri&s;on</HI>; a Committee, who are above the Reach of <HI>Fraud</HI> or <HI>Corruption</HI> them&s;elves, and fully qualified to &s;earch tho&s;e <HI>Deeds of</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="12">
<HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> to the Bottom; indeed it &s;eems to be re&s;erv'd to a Hou&s;e of Commons, and to them only.</P>
<P>It was the Saying of a known and judi|cious Writer, that no Man ought to com|plain in Print of any publick Grievance, un|le&s;s at the &s;ame Time he propo&s;ed al&s;o the Remedies; I &s;hall take the Hint, and offer &s;omething to the Purpo&s;e in this Ca&s;e, that I may di&s;mi&s;s it as I go:<LIST>
<ITEM>I. It would go a great Way towards pre|venting this Mi&s;chief, if it was provided in the <HI>Act,</HI> that no <HI>In&s;olvent</HI> &s;hould claim the Benefit <HI>twice</HI> over; it having been frequent to have them take <HI>new Credit,</HI> after their having been once <HI>di&s;charged,</HI> &s;eeking out new Places of Abode, and new Creditors, who, upon a Variety of Pretences, they in&s;inuate them&s;elves &s;o far into, as to get Credit with them, their former Circum&s;tances not being known.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That none &s;hould claim the Benefit of &s;uch an <HI>Act,</HI> who had <HI>run</HI> from their <HI>Bail,</HI> made <HI>E&s;capes</HI> from Officers or Pri&s;on-keepers upon their Parole, or that had committed any notorious <HI>Fraud</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="13">
puni&s;hable by Law, or that had obtain|ed Credit upon Promi&s;e and expre&s;s Conditions (before two or more Wit|ne&s;&s;es who &s;hall atte&s;t the &s;ame) not to claim or take the Benefit of any &s;uch <HI>Act of Grace.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. That none &s;hould claim &s;uch <HI>Benefit</HI> who &s;hall conceal any of their Goods and Effects from their Creditors, not|with&s;tanding their having made Affi|davit as the Law directs, as in the Ca&s;e of a Bankrupt.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e Provi&s;o's, together with a <HI>New Method</HI> to be taken, to limit and re&s;train the <HI>Pri&s;on-keepers,</HI> to prevent their keeping Pri|&s;oners on their Books after they have been <HI>di&s;charged, antedating</HI> their Commitments, and giving <HI>fraudulent</HI> Certificates of their being <HI>Pri&s;oners,</HI> when really they were not; I &s;ay the&s;e Methods, and &s;uch as the&s;e, un|der the farther Direction and Improvement of the Legi&s;lature, I per&s;wade my&s;elf would go a great way to prevent the Abu&s;e of <HI>Par|liamentary Grace,</HI> and to make the future <HI>Acts for Relief of In&s;olvents</HI> effectually and truly, merciful and good, and the hone&s;t <HI>poor</HI> Pri&s;oner, nobody repining at his Relief, would be deliver'd; the <HI>knavi&s;h</HI> de&s;igning
<PB N="11" REF="14">
Debtor remaining, <HI>as he ought to do,</HI> where the Law directs.</P>
<P>This leads me to enter a little into the Que&s;tion &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on by &s;ome, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>no Man &s;hould be put in Pri&s;on for Debt.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that this <HI>Doctrine</HI> has many Advocates, and &s;ome have pu&s;hed it &s;o far, as to think the contrary Opinion <HI>cruel</HI> and unchri&s;tian; but I &s;hall enquire more parti|cularly into it in the next Part.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I take this Occa&s;ion to repeat again what I hinted at before, name|ly, that this is &s;o far from <HI>impeaching</HI> the common Charity, and the Compa&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation to Pri&s;oners, that it prompts and recommends it by the meer Nature of the Thing; for when I argue again&s;t the Knavery of the Debtor, in mak|ing him&s;elf a <HI>voluntary</HI> Pri&s;oner, on purpo&s;e to defraud and delude his <HI>Creditors,</HI> it natu|rally follows that the Pri&s;ons &s;hould be pur|ged from all &s;uch voluntary, fraudulent Peo|ple, and tho&s;e that remain would be the more real and unexceptionable Objects of the National <HI>Grace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15">When the Pri&s;oners were all really <HI>In&s;ol|vent,</HI> really mi&s;erable, and that without any room to charge either <HI>them,</HI> or the <HI>Jailers</HI> and <HI>Keepers</HI> with corrupt Practices, abu&s;ing the publick Mercy, and the like, the Parlia|ment would always be the more ready to pa&s;s Acts for their Relief, as they &s;hould &s;ee Cau&s;e, &s;o that this Propo&s;al is evidently cal|culated to encourage and prompt the Mercy of the <HI>Publick</HI> to <HI>In&s;olvents,</HI> by removing all the ju&s;t <HI>Objections</HI> which now lie in the way, and have &s;o often ob&s;tructed it.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Nece&s;&s;ity of Pre&s;erving to the Creditor the Right of arre&s;ting and im|pri&s;oning the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> of his Debtor; and how the Petty Credit given in all Retail Trade, and which is e&s;&s;ential to the Support of our whole <HI>Commerce,</HI> depends upon it.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Believe it will not be called <HI>begging the Que&s;tion</HI> to lay it down as a <HI>Foundation,</HI> That as there is a greater Trade carried on in <HI>England</HI> than in any other Nation in <HI>Europe</HI>; &s;o there is a larger Per&s;onal Credit given in Trade here than in any other Nation, not in <HI>Europe</HI> only, but in the whole World.</P>
<P>There are &s;o many <HI>Evidences</HI> of the fir&s;t, and &s;o many Authors have written on that Subject, that I need only refer my Reader to them; and the la&s;t is evident to every
<PB N="14" REF="17">
MERCHANT now in Trade, who &s;ees with the lea&s;t Ob&s;ervation what Difference there is between the way of Trading here, and the like way of Trading in <HI>Foreign</HI> Coun|tries, and between the Credit given in ei|ther.</P>
<P>Some would make it a Que&s;tion, <HI>tho' I think it is no Que&s;tion,</HI> whether the Great|ne&s;s of our Trade is the Cau&s;e of giving this <HI>large Credit,</HI> or that the giving this large Credit is the Cau&s;e of the <HI>Greatne&s;s of our Trade.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ay there is no room to debate this Part; the latter is evident to Demon&s;tration, name|ly, that the giving &s;uch large Credit is the true Spring of the Greatne&s;s of our Trade: This appears by comparing the Bulk of the Trade in this Kingdom with the Bulk of our <HI>Current Stock</HI> in Trade. If no <HI>Credit</HI> was given, the Trade could not go beyond the <HI>Stock</HI>; it is true, it might go beyond the Current Coin, becau&s;e &s;ome Trade may be carry'd on by Barter, or exchanging one kind of Goods for another, without the In|terpo&s;ition of any <HI>Medium</HI> (which is Money) But no Trade can go beyond the <HI>Stock</HI> with|out <HI>Credit,</HI> becau&s;e one Value mu&s;t always be deliver'd for another, and they mu&s;t be
<PB N="15" REF="18">
always equal too, otherwi&s;e the Exchange is not equal, nor the Payment compleat.</P>
<P>But in Credit the Ca&s;e is quite different; for here the Seller delivers his Goods (which are a <HI>real Value</HI>) to the Buyer on his Note for Payment, or perhaps on his Verbal Promi&s;e, either of which, is an <HI>imaginary Value</HI> only; in a Word, the <HI>Fame</HI> or Reputation of a Buyer is put into the <HI>Scale of Commerce</HI> with the <HI>real</HI> Value and Sub&s;tance of the Seller, and the one is deliver'd for the other: the Account in the Trade&s;man's Ledger &s;tands as a Regi&s;ter of the Ca&s;e; the Buyer &s;tands Debtor on one &s;ide for the Value of the Goods &s;old and deliver'd to him again&s;t an open <HI>Blank</HI> on the contrary &s;ide, to be fill'd up to his <HI>Creditor</HI> when he pays the Mo|ney.</P>
<P>By this &s;trange thing call'd <HI>Credit,</HI> all the mighty Wonders of an exalted Commerce are perform'd; a Trade&s;man beginning with a Thou&s;and Pound Ca&s;h, and a good Cha|racter, &s;hall &s;tore his Shop or Warehou&s;e with 5000<HI>l.</HI> in Goods, and may trade for 10000, nay for 20000<HI>l. per Annum</HI>; and &s;o long as he manages <HI>prudently,</HI> pays cur|rently, and keeps up his Reputation, &s;hall run almo&s;t what Length he plea&s;es in his
<PB N="16" REF="19">
Trade, &s;o much greater a Stroke in Trade does his <HI>Character</HI> furni&s;h to him, than his <HI>Ca&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Foot of this very Article call'd <HI>Credit,</HI> as a private Man may trade for 10000<HI>l. per Annum</HI> with but 1000<HI>l.</HI> Stock, &s;o if the Stock of the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e Trade of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> be, as &s;ome in&s;i&s;t, Ten Millions, the Trade may actually return a Hundred Millions of Pounds Sterling in a Year; an <HI>immen&s;e</HI> Sum, but not at all <HI>improbable</HI> to be true, and per|haps within Compa&s;s too.</P>
<P>But to bring it down to the Subject: Take the Credit given in &s;maller Articles; I mean, in <HI>retailing</HI> Goods to the <HI>la&s;t</HI> Con&s;umer: This is what I call <HI>petty Credit,</HI> and is the particular thing which fills our Jails with <HI>In|&s;olvent</HI> Pri&s;oners. Even this <HI>petty Credit</HI> is, though &s;mall in the particular, immen&s;ely great in the general; and tho' it does not <HI>encrea&s;e</HI> the Stock of the Retailer, it certain|ly does <HI>encrea&s;e</HI> his Trade, and cau&s;es him to &s;ell a great deal more Goods than otherwi&s;e he would find Cu&s;tomers for.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Whole&s;ale</HI> Dealer tru&s;ts or gives Credit to the <HI>Retailer,</HI> and thereby encrea&s;es <HI>his Stock</HI> (for Credit in Trade is Stock in
<PB N="17" REF="20">
Trade) the <HI>Retailer</HI> gives Credit to the <HI>Con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">umer,</HI> and thereby increa&s;es <HI>his Sale.</HI></P>
<P>Now upon what Foundation is all this Credit given? The <HI>Retailer,</HI> being a <HI>Wool|len-Draper,</HI> tru&s;ts his Neighbour with a Suit of Clothes; how comes he to do it? per|haps the Man has no extraordinary Chara|cter; well but, &s;ays the <HI>Retailer,</HI> he is a Trade&s;man as well as I, and he mu&s;t pay me, or he &s;hall not be able to &s;tand at his Shop Door, or &s;it behind his <HI>Counter,</HI> for I will <HI>arre&s;t</HI> him and make him pay me; and upon this <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Arre&s;ting the Debtor,</HI> and carrying him to <HI>Pri&s;on,</HI> or whether he is carry'd to <HI>Pri&s;on</HI> or no, the expo&s;ing him, di&s;gracing him, and ruining his Credit; I &s;ay, upon this is founded the Freedom of the Trade&s;man to tru&s;t him.</P>
<P>If you de&s;troy this Power of <HI>Coercion,</HI> you de&s;troy the <HI>Credit in Trade</HI>; for if the Man cannot be <HI>credited,</HI> he cannot <HI>buy</HI>; and if the Trade&s;man cannot <HI>arre&s;t</HI> him, he will not &s;ell.</P>
<P>This particular Ca&s;e merits to be <HI>very well ob&s;erv'd</HI>; and there is more Weight in it than perhaps appears at fir&s;t View.<LIST>
<PB N="18" REF="21">
<ITEM>1. I &s;ay if the Buyer cannot be tru&s;ted, he cannot buy, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> he can|not buy at that time; he will make &s;hift for a while, will wear his old Clothes longer, go without &s;uch or &s;uch <HI>fine things</HI> for him&s;elf, or Wife, or Children, and abate in his Expence, becau&s;e he has not Money to buy, and the Shop-keeper will not tru&s;t him.
<P>Even the <HI>Drunkard</HI> will abate his Liquor, if the <HI>Alehou&s;e</HI> or <HI>Tavern|keeper</HI> will not admit him to &s;core; abundance of <HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Gaiety,</HI> as well in <HI>Food</HI> as <HI>fine things,</HI> mu&s;t abate for want of ready Money; whereas Men will venture to buy if they have Credit with the Trade&s;man.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, let Luxury and Extrava|gance <HI>abate,</HI> it will perhaps reform the Town, is to &s;ay nothing; for the <HI>Que|&s;tion</HI> does not lye that way: It is not whether the Luxury will abate, but will our <HI>Trade</HI> abate or not; if the <HI>Trade abates,</HI> as it certainly will, my Argument is good.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="19" REF="22">2. On the other hand, if the <HI>Buyer</HI> can|not <HI>buy,</HI> the <HI>Seller</HI> cannot <HI>&s;ell</HI>; then his Stock lyes dead on his Hands, the Money for it, and for which perhaps he has been tru&s;ted him&s;elf, grows due, and he cannot pay; he had bet|ter &s;ell, and give &s;ome <HI>Credit</HI>; but he is afraid to do that, becau&s;e if his Debtor refu&s;es to pay, he cannot force him to it. In &s;hort, he mu&s;t <HI>tru&s;t,</HI> or <HI>&s;hut</HI> up Shop, and <HI>break</HI>; and thus if a LAW &s;hould be made to pre|vent <HI>arre&s;ting</HI> the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> of the <HI>Debtor,</HI> you at once de&s;troy <HI>Per&s;o|nal Credit</HI> and <HI>ruin</HI> the Trade&s;men.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I remember an Attempt ignorantly made, (as it appear'd afterwards) even by the <HI>Trade&s;men</HI> them&s;elves, to de&s;troy this <HI>Petty Credit:</HI> The Shop-keepers mightily af|fected to write over their Shop-Doors, No TRUST BY RETAIL. But the Con&s;equence &s;oon appear'd, to the opening their Under|&s;tandings; for <HI>Thou&s;ands</HI> of Buyers, who laid out their Money freely, and who, tho' they might not always pay down upon the <HI>Spot,</HI> yet paid tolerably well, went from their Shops, and bought where they knew they could be <HI>tru&s;ted.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="23">In a Word, any LAW which abates <HI>Petty Credit,</HI> or Tru&s;t by Retail, will be fatal to TRADE, and would give &s;uch a <HI>Blow</HI> to our Commerce in general, as it would be impo&s;&s;ible for all our Heads put together to retrieve.</P>
<P>Therefore if we will &s;upport <HI>Trade,</HI> we mu&s;t encourage <HI>Petty Credit</HI>; and if you will &s;upport <HI>Petty Credit,</HI> you mu&s;t not take away the <HI>Security</HI> to the <HI>Creditor</HI>; the Security of the Trade&s;man's tru&s;ting his Neighbour is the Power he has by Law to <HI>enforce</HI> his Payment, and of arre&s;ting and impri&s;oning the Debtor if he fails or refu|&s;es: The Law is the Trade&s;man's <HI>Secu|rity,</HI> and if you take away the <HI>Law,</HI> which is his <HI>Security,</HI> you take away his Trade.</P>
<P>What is the Rea&s;on why in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in other Countries, they have &s;o <HI>little</HI> Trade? 'tis becau&s;e you cannot <HI>enforce</HI> your Demand of Debt, you can't &s;end the Debtor to Pri&s;on; and therefore no Man <HI>buys</HI> till he has <HI>Money</HI> to pay; if you will impri&s;on the Debtor, you mu&s;t allow him a Main|tenance, or he will come out before your Face.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="24">It may be true, that there is &s;ome <HI>Humanity</HI> in &s;uch a Law, but I cannot &s;ay there is any <HI>Policy</HI> in it; for it overthrows <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Cre|dit, and that in effect &s;inks Trade, le&s;&s;ens the <HI>Con&s;umption</HI> of Goods, and <HI>ruins</HI> the Trade&s;men them&s;elves: I cannot but think it were much better to have an <HI>Act of Mer|cy</HI> every Year, to relea&s;e poor In&s;olvents upon rea&s;onable Conditions, than not have it in the Trade&s;man's Power to <HI>impri&s;on</HI> them when they do not pay; for this <HI>Mercy</HI> will not be &s;o prejudicial to the <HI>particular</HI> Creditors, as the other would be to the <HI>gene|ral</HI> Credit.</P>
<P>It is our Bu&s;ine&s;s to <HI>increa&s;e</HI> our Trade to the utmo&s;t by all lawful Methods; nay, wi&s;e Men in Commerce tell us, &s;ome Errors, even in Morality, had better be wink'd at, than the Trade be ruin'd, or than any <HI>general</HI> Head of Trade be impair'd; the Meaning is, that, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, even our Luxury or High-living, <HI>I do not mean our Drunkenne&s;s and Vice,</HI> is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to our Trade, that it were better <HI>continued,</HI> than be entirely <HI>&s;up|pre&s;&s;ed,</HI> the Trade would &s;uffer &s;o much.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, a Set of <HI>Sumptuary</HI> Laws, as they are called, to reform our Ex|travagancies in Equipages and Dre&s;s, Hou&s;e-Furniture
<PB N="22" REF="25">
and Diet, would effectually <HI>ruin</HI> our Commerce, &s;tarve and leave unemploy'd our <HI>Poor,</HI> and reduce the whole Nation to a mo&s;t deplorable Condition of Mi&s;ery and Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>It would be the like,</HI> in Ca&s;e of a Stop to <HI>Credit,</HI> for it would be an Abatement of the Con&s;umption in all Sorts of Goods, as well our Manufactures and Home Product, as our importation from abroad; for as the la&s;t Con|&s;umer is the Life of all, if Credit abates, he abates his Expence, and buys le&s;s; con&s;e|quently Trade declines, and le&s;s is con&s;umed. By Credit here, <HI>that I may explain Things as I go,</HI> I mu&s;t be under&s;tood to mean not <HI>pub|lick</HI> Credit, I have nothing to do with that Part here; but <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Credit, the <HI>ordinary</HI> Credit given by one Trade&s;man to another, as well in <HI>whole&s;ale</HI> Dealing and Merchandi|zing, as in Retailing from the Shopkeeper to his Neighbours and Cu&s;tomers, and indeed chiefly the <HI>la&s;t</HI>; for on that does the Whole|&s;ale Part depend.</P>
<P>Upon this Foundation I build the Con&s;e|quences which I in&s;i&s;t upon, as above; this <HI>Tru&s;t by Retail,</HI> this <HI>petty</HI> Credit entirely de|pends upon the Right which every Citizen, thus &s;elling his Goods to his Neighbour <HI>upon</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="26">
<HI>his Word,</HI> that is, upon his <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Credit, has by <HI>Law to &s;ue, arre&s;t, impri&s;on,</HI> and <HI>keep in Pri&s;on his Debtor,</HI> if he delays or refu&s;es to pay the Money when it is due.</P>
<P>If you take away this <HI>Right,</HI> you take away the <HI>Credit</HI>; for no Man will &s;ell his Goods upon a <HI>Faith</HI> which the Debtor is not obli|ged to <HI>keep.</HI></P>
<P>It is a great Mi&s;take to &s;ay, <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Cre|dit is given upon the <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> of the Debtor; the ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e, the <HI>Credit</HI> is given to the <HI>Law</HI>; 'tis my being able to pro&s;ecute the Debtor in a Cour&s;e of Law, and <HI>(as we call it)</HI> make him pay me, that encourages me to tru&s;t him; and there|fore 'tis the ordinary Enquiry of a Trade&s;man, when he would <HI>inform</HI> him&s;elf about a Man he deals with, not whether he be <HI>hone&s;t,</HI> but whether he is <HI>able</HI>; if you tell him he is a <HI>Knave,</HI> and won't pay any body if he can help it, <HI>O,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>Trade&s;man, I don't value that; I am willing to get off the Goods, and if he is</HI> able, <HI>I'll venture; for I know how to make him willing.</HI></P>
<P>Nor does any Part of this Di&s;cour&s;e, to repeat it again, tend in the lea&s;t to prevent our <HI>Tenderne&s;s</HI> to any of the&s;e <HI>Debtors</HI> who
<PB N="24" REF="27">
are thus <HI>impri&s;on'd,</HI> if by Di&s;a&s;ters, Lo&s;&s;es, Misfortunes, or any vi&s;ible Accident they are render'd really poor and unable, but that &s;uch &s;hould always be reliev'd; and if the Creditor be <HI>cruel</HI> and inexorable, as &s;ome perhaps will always be, the Parliament will, on all ju&s;t Occa&s;ions, <HI>of which al&s;o they are the proper Judges,</HI> deliver &s;uch In&s;olvents by <HI>Acts of Clemency and Grace,</HI> as they do <HI>now,</HI> and no Chri&s;tian Trade&s;man can, I think, re|pine at their commi&s;erating and relieving <HI>unfortunate,</HI> tho' otherwi&s;e <HI>hone&s;t In&s;olvents.</HI></P>
