<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Apprehending, Examination, and Impri&s;on|ment
of Jack, for Su&s;picion of Poi&s;oning.</HEAD>
<P>THE attentive Reader cannot have
forgot, that in my la&s;t Part, the Sto|ry
of <HI>Yan Pt&s;chirn&s;ooker</HI>'s Powder
was interrupted by a Me&s;&s;age from <HI>Frog.</HI> I
have a natural Compa&s;&s;ion for Curio&s;ity, be|ing
much troubled with the Di&s;temper my
&s;elf; therefore to gratify that unea&s;y itching
Sen&s;ation in my Reader, I have procur'd the
following Account of that Matter.</P>
<P><HI>Yan Pt&s;chirn&s;ooker</HI> came off (as Rogues
u&s;ually do upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions) by Peach|ing
<PB N="4" REF="3">
his Partner, and being extremely forward
to bring him to the Gallows; <HI>Jack</HI> was ac|cus'd&punc;
as the Contriver of all the Roguery.
And indeed it happen'd unfortunately for
the poor Fellow, that he was known to bear
a mo&s;t inveterate Spight again&s;t the old Gen|tlewoman,
and con&s;equently, that never any
ill Accident happen'd to her, but he was &s;u|&s;pected
to be at the bottom of it. If &s;he
prick'd her Finger, <HI>Jack,</HI> to be &s;ure, laid the
Pin in the way: If &s;ome Noi&s;e in the Street
di&s;turb'd her Re&s;t, who could it be but <HI>Jack</HI>
in &s;ome of his nocturnal Rambles? If a Ser|vant
run away, <HI>Jack</HI> had debauch'd him:
every idle Tittle-tattle that went about, <HI>Jack</HI>
was always &s;u&s;pected for the Author of it:
However, all was nothing to this la&s;t Affair
of the temperating, moderating Powder. The
Hue and Cry went after <HI>Jack,</HI> to Apprehend
him, dead or alive, wherever he could be
found. The Con&s;tables look'd out for him
in all his u&s;ual Haunts; but, to no purpo&s;e.
Where d'ye think did they find him at la&s;t?
Ev'n &s;moaking his Pipe very quietly, at his
Brother <HI>Martin</HI>'s; from whence he was car|ry'd,
with a va&s;t Mob at his Heels, before
the Wor&s;hipful Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Overdo.</HI> Several
of his Neighbours made Oath, That of late,
the Pri&s;oner had been ob&s;erv'd to lead a ve|ry
di&s;&s;olute Life, renouncing ev'n his u&s;ual
Hypocri&s;y, and Pretences to Sobriety: That
he frequented Taverns and Eating-Hou&s;es,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
and had been often guilty of Drunkenne&s;s
and Gluttony at My Lord-Mayor's Table:
That he had been &s;een in the Company of
Lewd Women: That he had transferr'd his
u&s;ual religious Care of the engro&s;s'd Copy of
his Father's Will, to Bank Bills, Orders for
Tallies, and Debentures:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Tale of the Tub.</NOTE> The&s;e he now af|firm'd,
with more literal Truth, to
be <HI>Meat, Drink, and Cloth, the Philo|&s;ophers
Stone, and the &V;niver&s;al Medi|cine:</HI>
That he was &s;o far from &s;hewing his
cu&s;tomary Reverence to the <HI>Will,</HI> that he
kept company with tho&s;e that call'd his Fa|ther
a cheating Rogue, and his <HI>Will</HI> a For|gery.
That he not only &s;at quietly and
heard his Father rail'd at, but often chim'd
in with the Di&s;cour&s;e, and hugg'd the Au|thors
as his Bo&s;om Friends:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Tale of the Tub.</NOTE> <HI>That
in&s;tead of asking for Blows, at the
Corners of the Streets,</HI> he now be|&s;tow'd
them as plentifully as he begg'd them
before: In &s;hort, That he was grown a meer
Rake; and, had nothing left in him of old
<HI>Jack,</HI> except his Spight to <HI>John Bull</HI>'s Mo|ther.</P>
<P>Another Witne&s;s made Oath, That <HI>Jack</HI>
had been overheard bragging of a Trick he
had found out to manage the <HI>old formal Jade,</HI>
as he us'd to call her. <Q>Damn this numb'd-Skull
of mine (quoth he) that I could not
light on it &s;ooner. As long as I go in this
ragged tatter'd Coat, I am &s;o well known,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
that I am hunted away from the old Wo|man's
Door by every barking Curr about
the Hou&s;e, they bid me Defiance; there's
no doing Mi&s;chief as an open Enemy, I
mu&s;t find &s;ome way or another of getting
within Doors, and then I &s;hall have better
Opportunities of playing my Pranks, be|&s;ides
the Benefit of good keeping.</Q></P>
<P>Two Witne&s;&s;es Swore, that &s;everal Years
ago, there came to their Mi&s;tri&s;s's Door, a
young Fellow in a tatter'd Coat, that went
by the Name of <HI>Timothy Trim,</HI> whom they
did in their Con&s;cience believe to be the
very Pri&s;oner, re&s;embling him in Shape, Sta|ture,
and the Features of his Countenance;
that the &s;aid <HI>Timothy Trim</HI> being taken in|to
the Family, clap'd their Mi&s;tri&s;s's Livery
over his own tatter'd Coat; that the &s;aid
<HI>Timothy</HI> was extremely officious about their
Mi&s;tri&s;s's Per&s;on, endeavouring by Flattery
and Tale-bearing, to &s;et her again&s;t the re&s;t
of the Servants; no Body was &s;o ready to
fetch any thing that was wanted, or reach
what was drop'd; that he us'd to &s;hove and
elbow his Fellow-Servants to get near his
Mi&s;tre&s;s, e&s;pecially when Mony was a pay|ing
or receiving, then he was never out of
the way; that he was extremely diligent
about every Bodies Bu&s;ine&s;s but his own;
that the &s;aid <HI>Timothy,</HI> while he was in the
Family, us'd to be playing Rogui&s;h Tricks;
when his Mi&s;tre&s;s's back was turn'd he would
<PB N="7" REF="6">
loll out his Tongue, make Mouths, and laugh
at her, walking behind her like a <HI>Harlequin,</HI>
ridiculing her Motions and Ge&s;tures; if his
Mi&s;tre&s;s look'd about, he put on a grave,
demure Countenance, as he had been in a
fit of Devotion; that he us'd often to trip
up Stairs &s;o &s;moothly that you could not
hear him tread, and put all things out of
Order; that he would pinch the Children
and Servants, when he met them in the dark,
&s;o hard, that he left the Print of his Fore-fingers
and his Thumb in black and blue,
and then &s;link into a corner, as if no Body had
done it: Out of the &s;ame malicious De&s;ign,
he us'd to lay Chairs and Joint-&s;tools in their
way, that they might break their No&s;es by
falling over them. The more young and un|experienc'd,
he us'd to teach to talk Saucily,
and call Names: During his &s;tay in the Fa|mily
there was much Plate mi&s;&s;ing; that be|ing
catch'd with a couple of Silver Spoons in
his Pocket, with their Handles wrench'd off,
he &s;aid, he was only going to carry them to
the Gold&s;miths to be mended; that the &s;aid
<HI>Timothy</HI> was hated by all the hone&s;t Servants,
for his ill-condition'd, &s;plenetick Tricks, but
e&s;pecially for his &s;landerous Tongue; tradu|cing
them to their Mi&s;tre&s;s, as Drunkards,
Thieves and Whore-ma&s;ters; that the &s;aid <HI>Ti|mothy,</HI>
by lying Stories, us'd to &s;et all the Family
together by the Ears, taking delight to make
them Fight and Quarrel; particularly one Day
<PB N="8" REF="7">
&s;itting at Table, he &s;poke Words to this Ef|fect:
<Q>I am of Opinion <HI>(quoth he)</HI> That little
&s;hort Fellows, &s;uch as we are, have better
Hearts. and could beat the tall Fellows; I
wi&s;h it came to a fair Trial, I believe, the&s;e
long Fellows, as &s;ightly as they are, &s;hould
find their Jackets well thwack'd.</Q> A parcel
of tall Fellows, who thought them&s;elves af|fronted
by this Di&s;cour&s;e, took up the Qua|rel,
and to't they went, the tall Men and
the low Men, which continues &s;till a Faction
in the Family, to the great Di&s;order of our
Mi&s;tre&s;s's Affairs: That the &s;aid <HI>Timothy</HI> car|ried
this Frolick &s;o far, that he propos'd to
his Mi&s;tre&s;s, that &s;he &s;hould entertain no Ser|vant
that was above four Foot &s;even Inches
high, and for that Purpo&s;e had prepar'd a
Gage, by which they were to be mea&s;ur'd:
That the good old Gentlewoman was not &s;o
&s;imple as to go into his Projects, &s;he began
to &s;mell a Rat. <Q>This <HI>Trim</HI> (quoth &s;he)
is an odd &s;ort of a Fellow, methinks he
makes a &s;trange Figure with that ragged,
tatter'd Coar, appearing under his Livery,
can't he go &s;pruce and clean, like the re&s;t
of the Servants? The Fellow has a Rogui&s;h
Leer with him, which I don't like by any
means: be&s;ides, he has &s;uch a twang in his
Di&s;cour&s;e, and an ungraceful way of &s;peak|ing
through the No&s;e, that one can hardly
under&s;tand him; I wi&s;h the Fellow be not
Tainted with &s;ome bad Di&s;ea&s;e.</Q>  The Wit|ne&s;&s;es
<PB N="9" REF="8">
farther made Oath, That the &s;aid <HI>Ti|mothy</HI>
lay out a Nights, and went abroad of|ten
at un&s;ea&s;onable Hours; that it was credi|bly
reported, he did Bu&s;ine&s;s in another Fa|mily;
that he pretended to have a &s;queami&s;h
Stomach, and could not eat at Table with
the re&s;t of the Servants, tho' this was but
a pretence to provide &s;ome nice Bit for him|&s;elf;
that he refus'd to Dine upon Salt-fi&s;h,
only to have an opportunity to eat a Calve's
Head (his Favourite Di&s;h) in private; that
for all his tender Stomach, when he was got
by him&s;elf, he would devour Capons, Tur|keys
and Sirloins of Beef, like a Cormorant.</P>
<P>Two other Witne&s;&s;es gave the following
Evidence, That in his officious Attendance
upon his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he had try'd to &s;lip in
a Powder into her Drink, and that once
he was catch'd endeavouring to &s;tifle
her with a Pillow as &s;he was a &s;leep; that
he and <HI>Pt&s;chirn&s;ooker</HI> were often in clo&s;e
Conference, and that they us'd to drink to|gether
at the <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> where it &s;eems he was
well enough known by the true Name of
<HI>Jack.</HI></P>
<P>The Pri&s;oner had little to &s;ay in his De|fence;
he endeavour'd to prove him&s;elf <HI>Alibi;</HI>
&s;o that the Trial turn'd upon this &s;ingle Que|&s;tion,
whether the &s;aid <HI>Timothy Trim</HI> and
<HI>Jack,</HI> were the &s;ame Per&s;on? which was
prov'd by &s;uch plain Tokens, and particu|larly
by a Mole under the left Pap, that
<PB N="10" REF="9">
there was no with&s;tanding the Evidence;
therefore the Wor&s;hipful Mr. Ju&s;tice com|mitted
him, in order to his Tryal.</P>

<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How Jack's Friends came to vi&s;it him in Pri&s;on,
and what Advice they gave him.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JACK</HI> hitherto had pa&s;s'd in the World
for a poor, &s;imple, well-meaning, half-witted,
crack'd-brain'd Fellow, People were
&s;trangely &s;urpriz'd to find him in &s;uch a
Roguery; that he &s;hould di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf
under a fal&s;e Name, hire him&s;elf out for a
Servant to an old Gentlewoman, only for an
opportunity to Poi&s;on her. They &s;aid, That
it was more Generous to profe&s;s open En|mity,
than, under a profound Di&s;&s;imulation,
to be guilty of &s;uch a &s;candalous Breach of
Tru&s;t, and of the &s;acred Rights of Ho&s;pita|lity.
In &s;hort, the Action was univer&s;ally
Condemn'd by his be&s;t Friends; they told
him in plain terms, That this was come as a
Judgment upon him, for his loo&s;e Life, his
Gluttony, Drunkenne&s;s and Avarice, laying
a&s;ide his Father's <HI>Will</HI> in an old mouldy Trunk,
and turning Stock-jobber, News-monger,
and Bu&s;ie-body, meddling with other Peoples
Affairs, &s;haking off his old &s;erious Friends,
and keeping Company with Buffoons and
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Pick-pockets, his Father's &s;worn Enemies;
That he had be&s;t throw him&s;elf upon the
Mercy of the Court, Repent, and change his
Manners. To &s;ay truth, <HI>Jack</HI> heard the&s;e
Di&s;cour&s;es with &s;ome Compunction; how|ever
he re&s;olv'd to try what his new Acquain|tance
would do for him: They &s;ent <HI>Habakkuk
Slyboots,</HI> who deliver'd him the following
Me&s;&s;age, as the peremptory Commands of
his tru&s;ty Companions.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Habakkuk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Jack,</HI> I am &s;orry for thy
Misfortune; Matters have not been carried
on with due Secrecy; however, we mu&s;t
make the be&s;t of a bad Bargain: Thou art in
the utmo&s;t Jeopardy, that's certain; Hang,
Draw and Quarter, are the gentle&s;t things
they talk of. However, thy faithful Friends,
ever watchful for thy Security, bid me tell
thee, That they have one infallible Expedient
left to &s;ave thy Life: Thou mu&s;t know, we
have got into &s;ome Under&s;tanding with the
Enemy, by the means of <HI>Don Diego Di&s;mallo;</HI>
he a&s;&s;ures us there is no Mercy for thee, and
that there is only one way left to E&s;cape;
it is indeed &s;omewhat out of the common
Road, however, be a&s;&s;ur'd, it is the re&s;ult of
mo&s;t mature Deliberation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee tell me quickly, for my
Heart is &s;unk down into the very bottom of
my Belly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the unanimous Opinion of your
Friends, that you make as if you hang'd your
<PB N="12" REF="11">
&s;elf; that they will give it out that you are
quite dead, and convey your Body out of
Pri&s;on in a Beir; and that <HI>John Bull,</HI> being
bu&s;ied with his Law-Suit, will not enquire
further into the matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>How d'ye mean, make as if I had
hang'd my &s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, you mu&s;t really hang your
&s;elf up in a true genuine Rope, that there may
appear no Trick in it, and leave the re&s;t to
your Friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly this is a matter of &s;ome Con|cern;
and my Friends, I hope, won't take
it ill, if I enquire a little into the means by
which they intend to deliver me: A Rope,
and a Noo&s;e, are no je&s;ting Matters!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o mi&s;tru&s;tful? ha&s;t&punc; thou ever
found us fal&s;e to thee? I tell thee, there is one
ready to cut thee down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I pre&s;ume to ask who it is that
is entru&s;ted with that important Office?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there no end of thy How's and
thy Why's? that's a Secret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Secret, perhaps, that I may be
&s;afely tru&s;ted with, for I am not like to tell
it again. I tell you plainly, it is no &s;trange
thing for a Man, before he hangs him&s;elf up,
to enquire who is to cut him down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou &s;u&s;picious Creature! if thou
mu&s;t needs know it, I tell thee it is Sir <HI>Roger;</HI>
he has been in Tears ever &s;ince thy Misfor|tune.
<HI>Don Diego</HI> and we have laid it &s;o, that
<PB N="13" REF="12">
he is to be in the next Room, and before
the Rope is well about thy Neck, re&s;t &s;ati&s;|fied,
he will break in, and cut thee down:
Fear not, old Boy; we'll do't, I'll warrant
thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I mu&s;t hang my &s;elf up, upon
hopes that Sir <HI>Roger</HI> will cut me down, and
all this upon the Credit of <HI>Don Diego:</HI> A fine
Stratagem indeed to &s;ave my Life, that de|pends
upon Hanging, <HI>Don Diego,</HI> and Sir
<HI>Roger!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell thee there is a My&s;tery in all
this, my Friend, a piece of profound Policy;
if thou knew what good this will do to the
Common Cau&s;e, thy Heart would leap for
Joy: I'm &s;ure thou would not delay the Ex|periment
one moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is to the Tune of <HI>All for the bet|ter.</HI>
What's your Cau&s;e to me, when I am
hang'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Refractory Mortal! If thou wilt not
tru&s;t thy Friends, take what follows; know
a&s;&s;uredly, before next full Moon, that thou
wilt be hung up in Chains, or thy Quarters
perching upon the mo&s;t con&s;picuous Places
of the Kingdom. Nay, I don't believe they
will be contented with Hanging, they talk
of Empaling, or breaking on the Wheel; and
thou chu&s;e&s;t that, before a gentle &s;u&s;pending
of thy &s;elf, for one Minute. Hanging is not
&s;o painful a thing as thou imagines. I have
&s;poke with &s;everal that have undergone it,
<PB N="14" REF="13">
they all agree it is no manner of unea&s;ine&s;s;
be &s;ure thou take good notice of the Symp|toms,
the Relation will be curious; it is but
a kick or two with thy Heels, and a wry
Mouth or &s;o: Sir <HI>Roger</HI> will be with thee in
the twinkling of an Eye.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if Sir <HI>Roger</HI> &s;hould not
come? will my Friends be there to Succour
me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubt it not; I will provide every
thing again&s;t to Morrow Morning, do thou
keep thy own Secret, &s;ay nothing: I tell
thee, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the Com|mon
Good, that thou &s;hould&s;t go through this
Operation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How Jack hang'd him&s;elf up by the Per&s;wa&s;ion
of his Friends, who broke their Word, and
left his Neck in the Noo&s;e.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JACK</HI> was a profe&s;s'd Enemy to <HI>Implicit
Faith,</HI> and yet I dare &s;ay, it was never
more &s;trongly exerted, nor more ba&s;ely abu&s;ed,
than upon this occa&s;ion. He was now, with
his old Friends, in the &s;tate of a poor disband|ed
Officer after a Peace; or rather a wounded
Soldier after a Battle; like an old Favourite
of a cunning Mini&s;ter after the Jobb is over;
or a decay'd Beauty to a cloy'd Lover in
<PB N="15" REF="14">
que&s;t of new Game; or like an hundred &s;uch
things that one &s;ees every Day. There were
new Intrigues, new Views, new Projects on
foot; <HI>Jack</HI>'s Life was the Purcha&s;e of <HI>Diego</HI>'s
Friend&s;hip, much good may it do them.
The Intere&s;t of <HI>Hocus</HI> and Sir <HI>Williams Crawly,</HI>
which was now more at Heart, made this
Operation upon poor <HI>Jack</HI> ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary.
You may ea&s;ily gue&s;s that his Re&s;t that
Night was but &s;mall, and much di&s;turb'd;
however the remaining part of his Time he
did not employ (as his Cu&s;tom was former|ly)
in Prayer, Meditation, or &s;inging a double
Ver&s;e of a P&s;alm, but amu&s;ed him&s;elf with
di&s;po&s;ing of his Bank-Stock; many a Doubt,
many a Qualm, over&s;pread his clouded Imagi|nation.
<Q>Mu&s;t I then (quoth he) hang up
my own per&s;onal, natural, individual Self,
with the&s;e two Hands! <HI>Durus Sermo!</HI>
What if I &s;hould be cut down, as my
Friends tell me? There is &s;omething Infa|mous
in the very Attempt; the World
will conclude I had a guilty Con&s;cience.
Is it po&s;&s;ible that good Man, Sir <HI>Roger,</HI> can
have &s;o much pity upon an unfortunate
Scoundrel, that has per&s;ecuted him &s;o many
Years? No, it cannot be: I don't love Fa|vours
that pa&s;s through <HI>Don Diego</HI>'s Hands.
On the other &s;ide, my Blood chills about
my Heart, at the thought of the&s;e Rogues,
with their bloody Hands grabbling in my
Guts, and pulling out my very Entrails:
<PB N="16" REF="15">
Hang it, for once I'll tru&s;t my Friends.</Q>
So <HI>Jack</HI> re&s;olv'd, but he had done more wi&s;e|ly,
to have put him&s;elf upon the Tryal of his
Country, made his Defence in Form; many
things happen between the Cup and the Lip,
Witne&s;&s;es might have been brib'd, Juries ma|nag'd,
or Pro&s;ecution &s;top'd. But &s;o it was,
<HI>Jack</HI> for this time had a &s;ufficient Stock of
Implicit Faith, which led him to his Ruin, as
the Sequel of the Story &s;hews: And now the
fatal Day was come, in which he was to try
this hanging Experiment. His Friends did
not fail him at the appointed Hour, to &s;ee
it put in practice. <HI>Habakkuk</HI> brought him a
&s;mooth, &s;trong, tough Rope, made of many
a ply of whole&s;ome <HI>Scandinavian</HI> Hemp,
compactly twi&s;ted together, with a Noo&s;e
that &s;lip'd as glib as a Bird-catcher's Gin.
<HI>Jack</HI> &s;hrunk and grew pale at fir&s;t &s;ight of it,
he handled it, mea&s;ur'd it, &s;tretch'd it, fix'd
it again&s;t the Iron-bar of the Window to
try its &s;trength, but no Familiarity could re|concile

left me the Practice. No &s;ooner had he ut|ter'd

Courage, he ty'd the fatal Cord to the Beam,
fitted the Noo&s;e, and mounted upon the bot|tom
of a Tub, the in&s;ide of which he had

walk'd with great Deliberation into both

him for the very thing which they had both
advis'd and ju&s;tify'd before, <HI>viz.</HI> his getting in|to
the old Gentlewoman's Family, and putting
on her Livery. The Keeper, who perform'd
the la&s;t Office, coming up, found <HI>Jack</HI> &s;wing|ing,
with no Life in him; he took down the
Body gently and laid it on a Bulk, and
brought out the Rope to the Company. <HI>This,
