<P>I Was ye&s;terday taking leave of all the town, with an intention of leav|ing it this day, but I am detained by the kindne&s;s of lord and lady S&mdash;, who have made a party to dine and &s;up on my account&mdash;I am impatient to &s;et out for my &s;olitude, for there the mind gains &s;trength, and learns to lean upon her&s;elf&mdash;In the world it &s;eeks or accepts of a few treacherous

&s;upports&mdash;the feigned compa&s;&s;ion of one&mdash;the flattery of a &s;econd&mdash;the ci|vilities of a third&mdash;the friend&s;hip of a fourth&mdash;they all deceive, and bring the mind back to where mine is re|treating, to retirement, reflection, and books. My departure is fixed for to-morrow morning, but I could not think of quitting a place where I have received &s;uch numberle&s;s and unmerited civilities from your lord|&s;hip, without returning my mo&s;t grate|ful thanks, as well as my hearty ac|knowledgments for your friendly en|quiry from Bath. Illne&s;s, my lord, has occa&s;ioned my &s;ilence&mdash;Death knocked at my door, but I would not admit him&mdash;the call was both unex|pected
<PB N="12" REF="13">
and unplea&s;ant&mdash;and I am &s;e|riou&s;ly worn down to a &s;hadow&mdash;and &s;till very weak, but weak as I am, I have as whim&s;ical a &s;tory to tell you as ever befel one of my family&mdash;Shan|dy's no&s;e, his name, his &s;a&s;h window are fools to it&mdash;it will &s;erve at lea&s;t to amu&s;e you&mdash;The injury I did my&s;elf la&s;t month in catching cold upon James's Powder&mdash;fell, you mu&s;t know, upon the wor&s;t part it could&mdash;the mo&s;t painful, and mo&s;t dangerous of any in the human body. It was on this cri&s;is I called in an able &s;urgeon and with him an able phy&s;ician (both my friends) to in&s;pect my di&s;a&s;ter|&mdash;'tis a venereal ca&s;e, cried my two &s;cientific friends&mdash;'tis impo&s;&s;ible, how|ever,
<PB N="13" REF="14">
to be that, replied I&mdash;for I have had no commerce whatever with the &s;ex, not even with my wife, added I, the&s;e fifteen years.&mdash;You are, however, my good friend, &s;aid the &s;urgeon, or there is no &s;uch ca&s;e in the world&mdash;what the devil, &s;aid I, without know|ing woman?&mdash;We will not rea&s;on about it, &s;aid the phy&s;ician, but you mu&s;t undergo a cour&s;e of mercury&mdash;I will lo&s;e my life fir&s;t, &s;aid I&mdash;and tru&s;t to nature, to time, or at the wor&s;t to death&mdash;&s;o I put an end, with &s;ome in|dignation, to the conference&mdash;and de|termined to bear all the torments I underwent, and ten times more, ra|ther than &s;ubmit to be treated like a <HI>&s;inner,</HI> in a point where I had acted

like a <HI>&s;aint.</HI>&mdash;Now as the father of mi&s;chief would have it, who has no plea&s;ure like that of di&s;honouring the righteous, it &s;o fell out that from the moment I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my doctors, my pains began to rage with a violence not to be expre&s;&s;ed, or &s;upported. Every hour became more intolerable.&mdash;I was got to bed, cried out, and raved the whole night, and was got up &s;o near dead that my friends in|&s;i&s;ted upon my &s;ending again for my phy&s;ician and &s;urgeon. I told them upon the word of a man of honour they were both mi&s;taken, as to my ca&s;e&mdash;but though they had rea&s;oned wrong, they might act right; but that &s;harp as my &s;ufferings were, I
<PB N="15" REF="16">
felt them not &s;o &s;harp as the imputa|tion which a venereal treatment of my ca&s;e laid me under&mdash;They an|&s;wered that the&s;e taints of the blood laid dormant twenty years, but they would not rea&s;on with me in a point wherein I was &s;o delicate, but would do all the office for which they were called in, namely to put an end to my torment, which otherwi&s;e would put an end to me&mdash;and &s;o have I been compelled to &s;urrender my&s;elf&mdash;and thus, my dear lord, has your poor friend with all his &s;en&s;ibilities been &s;uffering the cha&s;ti&s;ement of the gro&s;&s;|e&s;t &s;en&s;uali&s;t.&mdash;Was it not as ridicu|lous an embarra&s;&s;ment as ever Yo|rick's &s;pirit was involved in?&mdash;No|thing

<P>THERE is a &s;trange coinci|dence, Sancho, in the little events (as well as in the great ones) of this world: for I had been writing a ten|der tale of the &s;orrows of a friendle&s;s poor negro-girl, and my eyes had &s;carce done &s;marting with it, when your letter of recommendation, in be|half of &s;o many of her brethren and &s;i&s;ters, came to me&mdash;but why <HI>her bre|thren?</HI> or yours, Sancho! any more

<P>THIS was quite an <HI>Impromptu</HI> of Yorick's after he had been thoroughly <HI>&s;ou&s;ed.</HI>&mdash;He drew it up in a few mo|ments without &s;topping his pen. I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee it in your in|tended collection of Mr. Sterne's me|moirs, &amp;c. If you &s;hould have a copy of it, you will be able to rec|tify a mi&s;application of a term that Mr. Sterne could never be guilty of,

I &s;hould have &s;ent this fragment as &s;oon as I &s;aw Mrs. Me|dalle's adverti&s;ement, had I not been at a di&s;tance from my papers.

<P>MY dear and thrice reverend bre|thren, as well archbi&s;hops and bi|&s;hops, as the <HI>re&s;t</HI> of the inferior clergy! would it not be a glorious

<P>HOMENAS who had to preach next Sunday (before God knows whom) knowing nothing at all of the matter&mdash;was all this while at it as hard as he could drive in the very next room:&mdash;for having fouled two clean &s;heets of his own, and being

<PB N="173" REF="173">
will never preach more while breath is in his body.&mdash;No, faith, I &s;hall never again be able to tickle it off as I have done. I may &s;it up whole winter nights baking my blood with hectic watchings, and write as &s;olid as a FATHER of the church&mdash;or, I may &s;it down whole &s;ummer days evaporating my &s;pirits into the fine&s;t thoughts, and write as florid as a MOTHER of it.&mdash;In a word, I may compo&s;e my&s;elf off my legs, and preach till I bur&s;t&mdash;and when I have done, it will be wor&s;e than if not done at all.&mdash;<HI>Pray Mr. Such-a-one, who held forth la&s;t Sunday?

all over the &s;urface of his harangue, they not only play'd the devil and all with the &s;ublimity&mdash;but moreover the &s;aid tears, by their ni|trous quality, did &s;o refrigerate, pre|cipitate, and hurry down to the bot|tom of his &s;oul, all the un&s;avory par|ticles which lay fermenting (as you &s;aw) in the middle of his conception, that he went on in the coole&s;t and cha&s;te&s;t &s;tile (for a <HI>&s;oliloquy</HI> I think) that ever mortal man uttered.</P>
