<HEAD>THE <HI>ADVENTURES</HI> OF <HI>Captain</HI> Robert Boyle, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_I WAS born at a Sea-Port call'd <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>Lincoln-&s;hire.</HI> My Father was Captain and Owner of a Merchant-Ship that traded to the <HI>We&s;t-In|dies,</HI> but was ca&s;t away homeward-bound upon the Rocks of <HI>Silly,</HI> and but one Man &s;av'd of his whole Crew. My Mother and I were at an Aunt's in <HI>London</HI> when the unhappy News of my Father's Death arriv'd.</P>
<P>I was too young to feel my Lo&s;s; but my Mo|ther's Grief &s;oon broke her Heart, and left me a poor helple&s;s Orphan not ten Years of Age. It's true, I had a tender Aunt that was in pret|ty good Circum&s;tances, who took Care of my Education. I &s;oon learnt to read, and write a good Hand; I under&s;tood a little <HI>Latin,</HI> and was perfect Ma&s;ter of the <HI>French</HI> Tongue, which I
<PB N="2" REF="11">
had been learning from my Infancy; my Mother being born at <HI>Paris,</HI> where my Father marry'd her very young, and brought her to re&s;ide at <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>By that time I had reach'd Fourteen Years of Age, my Aunt told me it was Time for me to think of &s;ome Trade, de&s;iring me to chu&s;e what I lik'd be&s;t, and &s;he would provide for me ac|cordingly. Said &s;he, If I might advi&s;e you, I would have you &s;tudy the <HI>Law,</HI> under the Tuition of your Uncle&mdash;; But I told her I did not much care for any Calling that mu&s;t owe its Pro&s;perity to the Misfortune of others. And at la&s;t I cho&s;e that of a Watchmaker, as imagining my &s;elf to have a good mechanical Head. Accordingly I went upon Liking (as they call it) and my Ma&s;ter and I agreeing very well, I was bound with the u&s;ual Forms, and found civil U&s;age from him, in re&s;pect of my Birth and the Misfortunes of our Family.</P>
<P>My Aunt paid Forty Guineas (which was reck|on'd, at that Time, a great Price; but he was one of the Top of his Bu&s;ine&s;s) and be&s;ides to find me in Cloaths and other Nece&s;&s;aries, during my Seven Years Apprentice&s;hip.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Half Year we agreed very well; but within that Time my Ma&s;ter had married a Wife of a pretty good Fortune, and a large Share of Ill-nature. In a Month's time &s;he began to tyrannize over my Ma&s;ter, as well as me, and &s;oon prov'd, as the Saying is, <HI>The grey Mare to be the better Hor&s;e.</HI> She brought it to that Pa&s;s at la&s;t, that I was obliged to go on all her halfpenny Errands, and carry her Book to Church of a <HI>Sunday</HI> after her. I bore this to|lerably well, but not without complaining to my Aunt, who advis'd me to make my &s;elf as ea&s;y as I could, for &s;he fear'd Speaking would do no good.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="12">
I went on this Way for a whole Year, and then to compleat my Misfortunes, my poor Aunt died of a Drop&s;y. This indeed was the great|e&s;t Shock of all my Life; for while &s;he liv'd I felt no want of Father or Mother. She left me 800 <HI>l.</HI> and my Uncle&mdash;to be my Guar|dian. I &s;hall forbear mentioning his Name, not out of Regard to him, but of his Children, who have prov'd a &s;weet Grafting from a &s;our Stock, and as good as he was ba&s;e.</P>
<P>My Shrew of a Mi&s;tre&s;s continu'd her Ill-nature to me, and one Accident made her prove outragious.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter had a va&s;t Trade, and vented a great many Watches beyond Sea. One Day he had a large Parcel of them to go on Board a Ship bound for <HI>Lisbon;</HI> the Ve&s;&s;el lay at <HI>Dept|ford,</HI> and my Ma&s;ter was pleas'd to take me a|long with him in the Boat.</P>
<P>Before we were got to <HI>Limehou&s;e,</HI> my Ma|&s;ter call'd to Mind that he had forgot a Silver Watch that he had purpo&s;ely made for the Captain of the Ship. He landed me at <HI>Ratcliff-Cro&s;s,</HI> and de&s;ir'd I would be expeditious in going (for the Tide running downwards I could get to the <HI>Exchange</HI> &s;ooner on Foot than by Water again&s;t the Stream) then to take Boat at <HI>Billing&s;gate,</HI> and follow him to the Ship.</P>
<P>I ran almo&s;t all the Way, and I believe got to the <HI>Exchange</HI> in half an Hour. When I came home, I found no Body in the Shop but my Fellow-Prentice, who inform'd me my Mi&s;tre&s;s was above. I went immediately up Stairs for the Watch (for my Ma&s;ter told me he had left it in his own Room, being he had wore it &s;everal Days to prove the going of it) but found the Door &s;hut. Standing a Moment to con&s;ider, I heard a Man's Voice &s;peaking to my Mi&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="4" REF="13">
in a low Key, and I &s;oon under&s;tood by their Dialogue that Love was the Subject they talk'd of. I li&s;ten'd &s;ome Time, till I found they had left off Di&s;cour&s;ing, and were enter'd upon Action.</P>
<P>Now at the Head of the Stairs the Maid had left a Step-Ladder, that &s;he had us'd in the Morning, in nailing up &s;ome Valens to the Windows in the Dining-Room, and there being a Gla&s;s over the Chamber Door, I had a great Mind to &s;ee who it was that was doing my Ma&s;ter's Bu&s;ine&s;s in his Ab&s;ence. Thereupon I fixt the Ladder very &s;oftly again&s;t the Wain|&s;cot by the Door, and up I got; but leaning towards the Window in order to &s;ee into the Room, my Weight made the Ladder &s;lip, and the Top &s;liding again&s;t the Door bur&s;t it o|pen, and in fell I into the Room, Ladder and all, with no little Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>The loving Couple were mightily &s;urpriz'd you may be &s;ure, and were in &s;uch a Fright that they had forgot what they were a doing. But I &s;aw enough to convince me that my Ma|&s;ter was in a fair way to get to Heaven pure|ly upon my Mi&s;tre&s;s's Account.</P>
<P>After our Surprize was over, and every thing put in Order again between the Gentleman and Madam, I ventur'd to tell her my Errand. She gave me the Watch with a hearty good Box on the Ear, and told me &s;he wonder'd how I had the A&s;&s;urance to come up without Knock|ing; but, added &s;he, I believe you rather came upon &s;ome knavi&s;h De&s;ign, and had intended to rob your Ma&s;ter, if I had not been in the Room with my Phy&s;ician, that came on pur|po&s;e to &s;ee how I did.</P>
<P>It was plain enough what Phy&s;ic &s;he was ta|king, yet I made my Excu&s;e to her that I went to remove the Ladder, and it fell out of my
<PB N="5" REF="14">
Hand again&s;t the Door and bur&s;t it open; but I told her I was &s;orry I had di&s;turb'd her, made my Honours and walk'd off, taking no Notice that I had &s;een any Thing. I took Water at <HI>Billing&s;gate,</HI> and follow'd my Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the Boat I began to ruminate with my &s;elf, whether I had be&s;t keep this Accident a Secret, or di&s;clo&s;e it to my Ma&s;ter. At la&s;t, with many Pro's and Con's with my &s;elf, I re&s;olv'd to acquaint him with it; partly to be reveng'd on my Mi&s;tre&s;s for the Blow &s;he &s;truck me, and on the other &s;ide not to let my hone&s;t Ma&s;ter be kept in Ignorance of her U&s;age of him.</P>
<P>When I came on Board, the Captain com|manded me (with my Ma&s;ter's leave) to &s;it down at Table with 'em. We din'd heartily, the Wine and Punch went merrily round, and my Ma&s;ter, the Captain, with two more that were Pa&s;&s;engers, began to be in high Mirth; when Word was brought that the Captain's La|dy (as the Me&s;&s;enger call'd her) would be on Board in an Hour to take her Leave of him. My Ma&s;ter upon this Me&s;&s;age began to be mer|ry with the Captain; I wonder, &s;aid he, that you Seafaring Men will venture upon Wives. Why &s;o? reply'd the Captain. Why &s;o! re|turn'd my Ma&s;ter, Becau&s;e in my Opinion it &s;hould put you in Mind of <HI>Cuckold's-Point</HI> as you went by Water: Your Ab&s;ence gives 'em &s;uch a Conveniency, that I believe few let &s;lip the Opportunity. Why, an&s;wer'd the Captain, mayn't your Wife, even now, be doing you the Favour; has &s;he not Time enough, d'ye imagine? The Thing's &s;oon done; and if they have an Inclination, Watching and Re&s;traint will do no Good: Many an Alderman has been cornuted while upon <HI>Change;</HI> and I knew a Par|&s;on's Wife that &s;eldom went to Church, but took
<PB N="6" REF="15">
Time by the Forelock, and while the Husband (good Man) was taking Care of his Flock, the good Woman at Home was at her Occupation with her Gallant, a rich young Farmer. But the Par&s;on one Afternoon being taken &s;uddenly ill with a Giddine&s;s in his Head, was convey'd Home before he had begun his Work, and there &s;oon found the Occa&s;ion of his Pain; for he had been breeding Horns, as Children breed Teeth, a little unkindly. But however, the Par&s;on having Witne&s;&s;es enough of his Promo|tion in the Herd of Cuckolds, went to Law with the Farmer, and recover'd 500 <HI>l.</HI> Damages; and yet he has been heard often to &s;ay, that his Wife's Tenement was never the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>This Story occa&s;ion'd &s;ome other much to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e: At la&s;t my Ma&s;ter and I, (the Tide being turn'd,) took our Leaves of the Company, and wi&s;h'd 'em a good Voyage. Co|ming by <HI>Cuckold's-Point,</HI> my Ma&s;ter cry'd, <HI>Robin,</HI> why don't you pull off your Hat to the Gen|tleman in the Window yonder? I pull'd off my Hat very orderly, but &s;aw no Body; at which my Ma&s;ter fell into a great Fit of Laugh|ter, and cry'd I had been very courteous to the Horns. I then, under&s;tanding his Meaning, told him, that it was only for marry'd Men to &s;hew their Complai&s;ance that way; and, being a lit|tle piqu'd at the Affront I thought put upon me, &s;aid I believ'd mo&s;t marry'd Men were, or would be in the Li&s;t of Cuckolds. Why, how now, Sirrah! reply'd my Ma&s;ter, d'ye think I am, or &s;hall be a Cuckold? Why truly, &s;aid I, Sir, I have but little Rea&s;on to believe my Mi|&s;tre&s;s a Saint more than any other Woman; and to inform you farther of what I have &s;een to Day, I beg you would be pleas'd to go to &s;ome Publick Hou&s;e, that we may not be ob|&s;erved
<PB N="7" REF="16">
by the Watermen. My Ma&s;ter's Colour began to change upon this; and being very im|patient to be inform'd of what I knew, order'd the Waterman to land at <HI>Ratcliff-Cro&s;s,</HI> and wait a while.</P>
<P>We went to the <HI>Ship</HI> Tavern and had a pri|vate Room, where I declar'd to him the whole Truth. After many Que&s;tions and An&s;wers be|tween us, I &s;oon found he believed all that I told him, for he turn'd as pale as A&s;hes, and the Tears &s;tood in his Eyes. I then was &s;orry I had di&s;clos'd it to him, remembring the ini|mitable <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI>
<Q><L>He that is robb'd, not wanting what is &s;tole,</L>
<L>Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.</L></Q>
After &s;ome Time being &s;ilent, my Ma&s;ter broke into many extravagant Words, and threatning Actions; and at la&s;t I ventur'd to tell him, I thought him in the wrong to grieve at what could not be called back, and I wonder'd the World &s;hould unju&s;tly ca&s;t upon the Man the Ignominy which was properly due to the Wo|man for her Licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Time he began to be more calm, and made me this Compliment; <HI>Robin,</HI> &s;aid he, I have ob&s;erved in thee a more than common Under&s;tanding, Pr'ythee tell me in what Man|ner I &s;hall behave my &s;elf in this Affait. I thank you, Sir, &s;aid I, for your good Opinion of me, and, were it my own Ca&s;e, I would not take any Notice of it till I found her in the Fact, or &s;uch Circum&s;tances that even &s;he her &s;elf could not deny; and for the&s;e two Rea&s;ons, 1. Whenever it comes to an open Rup|ture you'll have but an unea&s;ie Living; and 2. that &s;he may take it into her Head to deny
<PB N="8" REF="17">
it, and then the whole Weight of her Anger will fall upon me; and truly, &s;aid I, I have too much of her Ill-nature already to bear any more with any manner of Patience.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter re&s;olved to follow my Coun&s;el, and intended to make his Wife believe he knew nothing of the Matter.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter could not imagine who this Gal|lant &s;hould be, by my De&s;cription, for I had never &s;een him before. We went to our Boat, and &s;o Home. When we came in, my Mi&s;tre&s;s ask'd my Ma&s;ter if <HI>Robin,</HI> meaning me, had been telling him any Stories. Stories, Child! an|&s;wer'd my Ma&s;ter, what Stories? he has told me nothing. Nay, no great matter, &s;aid my Mi&s;tre&s;s, but I gave him a Box on the Ear this Morning, when he came back for the Watch you had forgot, and I did not know but he had made &s;ome Complaint; but I am &s;orry for it, and will make him Amends one Time or other. This &s;he &s;aid &s;o loud that I might hear.</P>
<P>The next Day when my Ma&s;ter was gone to <HI>Change,</HI> &s;he came up into the Work-hou&s;e, as we call'd it, up three Pair of Stairs, and took an Occa&s;ion of &s;ending my Fellow-Prentice on &s;ome concerted Errand. When he was gone out &s;he &s;at down upon his Chair, and look'd me in the Face for &s;ome time. Well <HI>Robin,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, I am very much oblig'd to you, that you did not take any Notice of the Accident that hap|pen'd Ye&s;terday to your Ma&s;ter; and to make you Amends for your Silence I give you this Broad Piece to buy you a Pair of Gloves, with this Promi&s;e, that you and I will never di&s;agree again. I receiv'd her Money, and told her I &s;hould never take any farther Notice of it. She call'd me good Lad, and left me.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="18">
My Ma&s;ter had not always an Opportunity of talking with me at home, &s;o he appointed me every <HI>Sunday</HI> after Sermon in the Evening at &s;ome Tavern or other, that we might talk about the matter. At our fir&s;t Meeting I told him the Story of the Broad Piece, and the Di&s;|cour&s;e my Mi&s;tre&s;s and I had together. I &s;hew'd him the Money, and he &s;oon knew the Piece to be his Wife's from the particular Fairne&s;s of it, being the &s;ame he had &s;ome time ago given her for a Pocket-Piece.</P>
<P>Now, &s;aid he, <HI>Robin,</HI> I am fully convinc'd of the Infidelity of my Wife; for notwith&s;tanding your former Story, I had &s;ome faint Hopes it might have been a Tale of thine, rais'd out of Malice to thy Mi&s;tre&s;s, from her indifferent U|&s;age of thee.</P>
<P>But now to find out this Spark, that I may reak my Vengeance on him fir&s;t; for, to own my Folly, <HI>Robin,</HI> I mu&s;t tell thee I can't find I &s;hall ever be able to hate this ungrateful Wo|man. Some time after, my Ma&s;ter was pretty well convinc'd that his Wife had been with her Spark to the <HI>Mulberry-Garden,</HI> and my Ma|&s;ter had di&s;covered who he was; he prov'd to be a young Attorney of <HI>Clifford's-Inn.</HI> The next Thing we con&s;ulted about at our weekly Meeting was how to give 'em an Opportunity of pur&s;uing their Amour at Home. In Order to this, my Ma&s;ter gave out to my Mi&s;tre&s;s that he &s;hould be oblig'd to go as far as St. <HI>Margaret</HI>'s in <HI>Kent,</HI> to look after &s;ome Goods, that were landed there in order to avoid pay|ing Cu&s;tom for them, and he fear'd the Affair would not be &s;o well manag'd if he was not pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> following was cho&s;e for the Day of his &s;etting out. My Ma&s;ter gave me
<PB N="10" REF="19">
publick Orders to go to &s;everal Places in his Ab|&s;ence, to look after the Workmen (for there are &s;everal Trades belonging to the making of a Watch). On <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Morning my Ma&s;ter got on Hor&s;eback, in Order (as my Mi&s;tre&s;s and the re&s;t of the Family thought) to pur&s;ue his Journey: But he went no farther than <HI>I&s;ling|ton,</HI> and return'd, putting up his Hor&s;e again; and went &s;trait to the Place of our Rendez|vous.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my Ma&s;ter was gone, my Mi&s;tre&s;s call'd me up to her, and ask'd me if I had Time to &s;tep a little Way for her. I told her 'twas impo&s;&s;ible, being I had &s;ome Work to fini&s;h that I was oblig'd to carry out immediately. Then &s;he begg'd I would call her a Porter, which I did, and one of my particular Acquain|tance, one well to pa&s;s in the World; for a Ci|ty Porter in tho&s;e Days was a very beneficial Em|ployment, there being then no Penny-Po&s;t-Office. I told him what he &s;hould do, that he mu&s;t go to my Mi&s;tre&s;s and receive the Letter, and then to an adjacent Ale-hou&s;e, and wait till I came to him. Accordingly he receiv'd the Letter, and went to the Place I appointed. I did not let him wait long, but order'd my Matters as if I was going about my Ma&s;ter's Bu&s;ine&s;s, and went to the Porter. From thence I took him along with me to my Ma&s;ter, where we open'd the Letter, and found it as follows;&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dear <HI>Tom,</HI> it's an Age &s;ince la&s;t I &s;aw you; the Cuc|kold's gone out of Town for a Week, there|fore meet me at the Old Place by Six this E|vening."</Q> Here we were at a Stand, for we could not imagine where the <HI>Old Place</HI> was, un|le&s;s the <HI>Mulberry-Garden.</HI> At la&s;t we re&s;olv'd to &s;end the Porter to the Spark, and bring the An&s;wer to us, to &s;ee if that would give us more
<PB N="11" REF="20">
Light in the Affair. Accordingly he went, and return'd with his Billet; we made bold to open it, and found it contain'd the&s;e Words,&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">My Life, I don't think the old Place convenient, being a Brother Lawyer has di&s;covered &s;ome|thing of our Intrigue; therefore I'll wait on you before the Time, that we may concert Mea&s;ures accordingly. I am glad your Bea&s;t is out of Town; we'll add another Antler to adorn his Brow, a&s;&s;oon as I have the Hap|pine&s;s to &s;ee her who &s;hall eternally com|mand yours.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>When my Ma&s;ter perceiv'd that the Scene was to be open'd at his own Hou&s;e, he began to demur: But after keeping Silence a little Time, he &s;poke to me to this purpo&s;e. <HI>Robin,</HI> this Let|ter has in &s;ome &s;ort confounded our De&s;ign, for what I intend to act I would not, if it could be avoided, put in Execution at home, for fear it &s;hould make too much Noi&s;e; for, added he &s;miling, tho' a Man has the Misfortune to be a Cuckold, yet he would not have all the World know it. I told him I was glad to &s;ee him &s;o merry upon the Occa&s;ion, but begg'd he would not keep the Porter any longer, for fear of &s;ome Accident. He thank'd me for my Care, &s;eal'd up the Letter again, and &s;ent him away with it. When the Porter was gone, my Ma&s;ter order'd me to go home again, and ob&s;erve how Matters went there, and as &s;oon as ever the Spark came, to &s;end the &s;ame Porter back to him with this Notice, <HI>That the Work was ready to carry home, whenever I thought fit.</HI></P>
<P>I had not been at home a quarter of an Hour ere my Gentleman came in a Coach; he went up Stairs, but did not &s;tay a Moment, came down again, whi&s;per'd the Coachman, and drove into <HI>Cheap&s;ide.</HI> I was at a lo&s;s how to behave my &s;elf,
<PB N="12" REF="21">
but my Mi&s;tre&s;s order'd another Coach to be call'd. When I found that, I &s;ent for the Por|ter, and told him &s;ecretly that he mu&s;t dog that Coach let it go where it would, and be expe|ditious in bringing me Word. My Mi&s;tre&s;s came down in her Hood and Mask in her Hand, and went off in the Coach. I look'd after her as far as I could &s;ee her, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">b&s;er'd the Porter to jump up behind the Coach I immediately went to my Ma&s;ter, and acquainted him with the Bu&s;ine&s;s. He hurried me home again, for fear the Porter &s;hould wait for me, and order'd me to bring him, when he came, to the <HI>Pope's-Head</HI> Tavern, becau&s;e he would be nearer home.</P>
<P>The Porter did not return in two Hours: He told me that the Coach drove to <HI>York</HI> Stairs in <HI>York</HI> Buildings, and there they got out and took a Pair of Oars; he went in another, and follow'd 'em till they landed at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> and dog'd them into the <HI>White-Lyon</HI> Inn. There he &s;taid &s;ome time, to &s;ee if they intended to go from thence; he walk'd into the Kitchen and drank a Mug of Ale, and in a little time one of the Waiters came in, and told the Cook the Gentleman and his Wife had be&s;poke a roa&s;ted Fowl and &s;ome Fi&s;h for their Dinner, and had ordered clean Sheets to be put to air, for as &s;oon as they had din'd they de&s;ign'd to go to Bed, being the Stage Coach was to call them up at One the next Morning.</P>
<P>I did not think it altogether &s;o proper to take the Porter to the <HI>Pope's-Head</HI> to my Ma&s;ter, but went alone, where I found him with another Gentleman, a Stranger to me. When I had gi|ven him an Account, we took Coach all together and drove to the Hor&s;e-Ferry, <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> took Boat and landed at <HI>Lambeth.</HI> We all went in|to the <HI>White-Lyon</HI> the back Way, and I went
<PB N="13" REF="22">
to the Drawer (as we had before concerted) and ask'd if there was not a Gentleman and a Lady that did de&s;ign to lie there all Night to wait for a Stage Coach in the Morning; he an&s;wer'd in the Affirmative, but added they were that mo|ment gone to Bed, that they might be the bet|ter able to ri&s;e in the Morning. I ask'd him which Room they lay in, for that I had Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of great Con&s;equence to communicate to him. Why that Room up one Pair of Stairs, an&s;wer'd the Drawer, and pointed at the Door. Well, &s;aid I, fetch me a Pint of Wine, I'll drink a Gla&s;s, and then go and wait on them.</P>
<P>The Drawer ran down for the Wine, and in the mean time I beckon'd my Ma&s;ter; up Stairs we went, I &s;et my Foot again&s;t the Door, bur&s;t it open, and there we &s;oon perceiv'd the loving Couple playing at <HI>Rantum Scantum.</HI> I &s;hut to the Door again, and &s;tood Guard that no One &s;hould enter. My Ma&s;ter laid fa&s;t hold of my naked Gentleman, and with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Friend threw him upon his Back, clapt a Pi&s;tol to his Brea&s;t, and &s;wore he would &s;hoot him if he offer'd to &s;tir or cry out. Then my Ma&s;ter's Friend took out a Box of In&s;truments, and, with a Pair of Sci&s;&s;ars for that purpo&s;e, &s;oon depriv'd him of what <HI>Sene&s;ino</HI> and &s;everal <HI>Italian</HI> Singers want, as well as our Spark. The Thing was done &s;o &s;uddenly, that I believe my Gentleman hardly knew his Lo&s;s till he felt the Blood trickle about his Legs. He made &s;eve|ral Attempts to get up, but to no purpo&s;e. My Ma&s;ter told him he had better be quiet, for fear he &s;hould be wor&s;e &s;erv'd, (but in my Opinion that could hardly be.) The Surgeon (for it prov'd my Ma&s;ter's Friend was no other,) had all his Implements about him; he manag'd his Needle, his Plai&s;ters, and Salves, and fini&s;h'd my
<PB N="14" REF="23">
Gentleman, and would have had him gone home &s;omething lighter than he came, but he prov'd &s;o weak with Lo&s;s of Blood and the Pain toge|ther, that he fainted away.</P>
<P>My Mi&s;tre&s;s had hid her&s;elf behind the Cur|tain, and did not &s;o much as &s;ay one Word; but in all her Concern &s;he took Care to dre&s;s her &s;elf, and when &s;he had done &s;he &s;at upon the Bed&s;ide next the Wall, and &s;eem'd to be in deep Di&s;content.</P>
<P>We had got my Gentleman to him&s;elf again by the help of the Drawer, who &s;oon found how Matters went. When we had done, my Ma&s;ter &s;aid to his Wife, Madam, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was to blame to di&s;turb you in your Diver&s;ion, but I own my Fault, and will endeavour to mend it by leaving you together to &s;olace your &s;elves, and &s;o I take my Leave.</P>
<P>Upon this we march'd down Stairs, paid for our Wine, and went to our Boat that waited for us, and landed at the <HI>Still-yard.</HI> My Ma&s;ter was very unea&s;ie all the Way home, and we could not get one Word out of him. He went up Stairs, lock'd him&s;elf in his Room, and remain'd alone &s;everal Hours. I would have been willing to have diverted his Melancholy, but did not well know how I &s;hould go about it.</P>
<P>Near &s;even a Clock in the Evening he call'd me up Stairs, and ask'd me if I had heard any thing of his Wife. I told him no. Nay, &s;aid he, if &s;he has any Shame left, &s;he will hardly attempt to come home again in ha&s;te. After &s;ome time he went out, and did not come home a|gain till twelve a Clock. He ask'd me &s;till af|ter my Mi&s;tre&s;s, and under&s;tanding we had no News of her, went to Bed.</P>
<P>The next Morning he order'd me to &s;end the Porter to <HI>Lambeth,</HI> to learn how they behav'd
<PB N="15" REF="24">
them&s;elvos when we had left 'em. He return'd, and told my Ma&s;ter that the Gentlewoman went away as &s;oon as &s;he found we were gone, and left the Gentleman there, who was &s;o weak that he remain'd there &s;till, and had &s;ent for &s;everal of his Acquaintance.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon my Mi&s;tre&s;s's Mother came to my Ma&s;ter, and they had a long Di&s;cour&s;e, and afterwards went out together. But I was never more &s;urpriz'd in my Life, when he came home the &s;ame Evening with his Wife and Mo|ther. He vouch&s;af'd to tell me the next Day that his Wife re&s;olv'd never to be guilty of a|ny Fault again, and by her Submi&s;&s;ion and the Intreaties of her Mother, he had re&s;olv'd to take her home once more. Sir, &s;aid I, if you can forgive her, no one el&s;e has any thing to do with it. But, added I, I fear I &s;hall feel the Effects of her Di&s;plea&s;ure. No, an&s;wer'd my Ma&s;ter, that was one of my Conditions with your Mi&s;tre&s;s, that &s;he &s;hould take no Notice to you of pa&s;t Tran&s;actions. And truly &s;he kept her Word, for &s;he would not &s;o much as look at me.</P>
<P>She continu'd very re&s;erv'd for a great while, and never went out but to Church of a <HI>Sun|day.</HI></P>
<P>In the latter End of the &s;ame Year my Ma|&s;ter began to be out of Order, and the Phy&s;i|cian advis'd him to go into the Country for the Air; and accordingly he took Lodgings at <HI>Hamp|&s;tead,</HI> where my Mi&s;tre&s;s us'd to go twice or thrice every Week to &s;ee him; and my Ma&s;ter told me (when I went of a <HI>Sunday</HI> to wait up|on him, to give him an Account of the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the Shop) that his Wife had been &s;o tender of him in his Illne&s;s, that he verily be|lieved he &s;hould never have any Occa&s;ion to blame
<PB N="16" REF="25">
her Conduct again. I told him I was as well pleas'd as he was.</P>
<P>About a Week afterwards my Mi&s;tre&s;s went in and out very often, and feem'd to be very bu&s;ie, giving Orders to my Fellow-Prentice for taking her a Place in the <HI>Hamp&s;tead</HI> Coach as u|&s;ual. This happen'd on the <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> and I &s;aw her no more that Week.</P>
<P>When I went to my Ma&s;ter on the <HI>Sunday</HI> following, he ask'd me if my Mi&s;tre&s;s was out of Order, being he had not &s;een her &s;ince the <HI>Monday</HI> la&s;t. Nor I &s;ince <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> &s;aid I, but I thought &s;he had been with you, for &s;he took a Place in the Coach in order to come to you that Day, and &s;ent out &s;everal Bundles to be carry'd; as &s;he u&s;ually did when &s;he was coming to wait on you.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter was &s;o confounded with what I told him, that he did not offer to &s;peak for &s;ome time, and the Sweat ran down his Face like Drops of Rain. At la&s;t, &s;aid he, <HI>Robin,</HI> I fear all is not well! My Wife has certainly undone me. Come, hope for the be&s;t, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>Well, my Ma&s;ter re&s;olv'd, weak as he was, to go for <HI>London</HI> immediately. We took a Coach, and &s;oon got home; and there to our great Sorrow found my Mi&s;tre&s;s had robb'd my Ma&s;ter to the Value of Five Thou&s;and Pound in <HI>Bank</HI> Notes and Money, with Six and Thirty Gold Watches and Seventeen Silver Ones, be|&s;ides her own wearing Cloaths. My Ma&s;ter at this Lo&s;s &s;unk down upon his Bed. I went and fetch'd &s;ome of his Neighbours and Friends to comfort him, while I ran up and down like a Mad|man, to &s;ee if I could get any Tidings of the Thief.</P>
<P>I went to give Orders at the <HI>Bank</HI> to &s;top Payment, but to my great Sorrow found the Money had been receiv'd four Days before. I
<PB N="17" REF="26">
came back to acquaint my Ma&s;ter with my ill Succe&s;s, and found him alone and gone to Bed. When I told him I could not hear any Tidings of my Mi&s;tre&s;s, and that the Money had been receiv'd, he cry'd, <HI>Robin,</HI> it is not the Money that grieves me, but the ill U&s;age of my Wife; 'tis that has got to my Heart, and never to be remov'd till Death. I &s;at up with him a great while, till he told me he began to be &s;leepy, and ordered me to retire; but as I was going from him, he took me by the Hand, and bid me good Night. I found by his Pul&s;e that he was in a Fever, and begg'd I might call a Phy|&s;ician; but he &s;aid he &s;hould be better on the Morning, if not he would &s;end for one. Find|ing him willing to re&s;t, I left him and went to Bed.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I wak'd in the Morning, I put on my Gown, and went to &s;ee how he did; but found him &s;o weak and faint that he had not Strength enough to lift up his Head. I was immediately running to fetch a Phy&s;ician that liv'd hard by our Hou&s;e, but my Ma&s;ter call'd me back, and told me it was too late, for, &s;aid he, I feel my la&s;t Moment approaching. He order'd me to &s;it upon the Bed by him, he took my Hand in his, which burnt like Fire, and &s;aid, <HI>Robin,</HI> my Wife has kill'd me; I could have born any other Misfortune with Temper; if thou ever &s;hou'd&s;t &s;ee her, tell her from me that I forgive her, and that I beg &s;he would re|form her Life; but al&s;o let her know that &s;he was the Death of me. I told him I would not have him talk of Dying for an ungrateful Wo|man that did not de&s;erve the lea&s;t Regard, but to chear up his Spirits and let me go for a Phy|&s;ician. No, &s;aid he, all Phy&s;ic or Coun&s;el comes too late;</P>
<LG>
<PB N="18" REF="27">
<L>I've that within which baffles all their Art,</L>

</LG>
<P>He had no &s;ooner repeated tho&s;e Lines but his Speech fail'd him, his Eyes clos'd, and he ex|pir'd only with a Sigh.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was inwardly &s;hock'd, and the Spirit of Revenge ro&s;e in my Soul again&s;t the barbarous Cau&s;e of his End.</P>
<P>When I had a little recollected my &s;cattered Thoughts, I went to a Cou&s;in of my Ma&s;ter's that liv'd in <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> and de&s;ir'd he would come and take Care of his Affairs. For my own Part I could not compo&s;e my &s;elf for two or three Days: At la&s;t I went to my Uncle, and de&s;ir'd he would let me have Twenty Pounds to buy me Mourning, (for I did intend to wear Black, that my melancholy Out&s;ide might conform with what I felt within) out of Re&s;pect to my Ma|&s;ter's Memory. Mourning, <HI>Bob!</HI> an&s;wer'd my Un|cle, Why if thy Ma&s;ter's Friends won't give it thee, 'tis my Opinion thou ought'&s;t not to think on't. Yes, Sir, added I, I think it my Duty; for tho' my Mi&s;tre&s;s us'd me ill, my Ma&s;ter always was civil to me. But my Uncle told me in plain Terms that I &s;hould not have a Farthing. I told him I wanted but my own; but he reply'd, when he thought I was of Years enough to manage my Money my &s;elf, perhaps I might be tru&s;ted with it, but at pre&s;ent he would take Care of it for me.</P>
<P>I was very unea&s;y at this Affair, for it began to look as if he intended to cheat me of it, and I did not &s;tick to tell him my Sentiments in a civil manner, but to no purpo&s;e. I left him with a very heavy Heart, and came home. I
<PB N="19" REF="28">
went to Bed in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion of Thought; yet notwith&s;tanding my Di&s;content, &s;lept 'till Morning. I got up about &s;ix a-clock, with a &s;curvy Idea of my future Fortune. About eight, my Uncle's Man brought me a Letter from him, in which he begg'd my Pardon, and told me it was only to try my Temper. The Man gave me ten Guineas by his Order, and farther told me that his Taylor would be with me immedi|ately to take my Directions; and accordingly be|fore the Fellow was gone he came, took Mea|&s;ure of me, and told me he would be &s;ure to bring my Cloaths home by twelve a-clock the next Day; and he kept his Word with me.</P>
<P>In the mean time I had provided my &s;elf with every Thing el&s;e with the Money my Un|cle had &s;ent me; and the &s;ame Evening waited on him to return him Thanks. <HI>Bob,</HI> &s;aid he, I had only a Mind to try your Temper, and I find thou art Father's own Child, a Chip of the old Block.</P>
<P>He would have me &s;tay to &s;up with him, and among other Di&s;cour&s;e he ask'd me what I did intend to do now my Ma&s;ter was dead, for he did not &s;uppo&s;e I was Ma&s;ter of my Trade e|nough to follow it. I reply'd, I knew enough to recommend my &s;elf to any other Ma&s;ter without paying any more Money. My Uncle reply'd, I need|ed not be in &s;uch ha&s;te, but take &s;ome Time to con&s;ider of it, and in the mean while I &s;hould live with him and be heartily welcome. And to make his Actions agree with his Words he gave me five Guineas more for Pocket-Money, and gave Directions for me to be with one of his Clerks, a good-natured young Fellow, that was a School-fellow of mine.</P>
<P>I was very glad of the Occa&s;ion, living with my Uncle in great Tranquility the &s;pace of a
<PB N="20" REF="29" MS="y">
Month, and all the time he &s;eem'd to be very fond of me, never denying me any thing that I ask'd him.</P>
<P>One <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning before Church-time he call'd me to him, and (after many Profe&s;&s;ions of Friend&s;hip) ask'd me if I had never done any Bu&s;ine&s;s for my Ma&s;ter out of the Watch-ma|king Trade. I pretty well gue&s;s'd at what he meant, and an&s;wer'd him in the Affirmative. Very well, &s;aid he, I mu&s;t &s;end you as far as <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> to-morrow about the &s;ame Affair; and if I executed my Commi&s;&s;ion dextrou&s;ly, he told me it &s;hould be the better for me.</P>
<P>The next Morning I got up, and my Uncle &s;ent me with a Letter into <HI>Pall-Mall</HI> to a Cli|ent of his, and returning with an An&s;wer, found him taking his Leave of a Gentleman that look'd like a Sea-Officer. As &s;oon as their Compliments were over, my Uncle di&s;patch'd me away to <HI>Bil|ling&s;gate,</HI> and gave me In&s;tructions what to do. I was to enquire for a Ship call'd the <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> Capt. <HI>Stokes</HI> Commander, at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and then to follow his Directions.</P>
<P>As I was talking with my Uncle, my Bed|fellow thru&s;t a Book into my Pocket, and told me that would divert me in the Boat, if I had not Company that I lik'd. I did not much re|gard what he &s;aid, but went about my Bu&s;ine&s;s, got into the <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> Boat which put off up|on the In&s;tant, and had the Fortune to light of good Company, and one young Man that was going to the &s;ame Ship as I was.</P>
<P>We were very merry all the Way with lit|tle Stories we told among our &s;elves. We got on Board the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> about two a-clock in the Afternoon, and the fir&s;t Per&s;on I &s;aw was the &s;ame Man that I found with my Uncle in the Morning. He took me by the Hand, and car|ry'd
<PB N="21" REF="30">
me into the Cabin, and &s;et a Piece of Ship Beef before me. When I had din'd, he inform'd me my Things would be on Board immediately. I told him it was very well; not &s;u&s;pecting any thing. Afterwards the Captain went out, and left me alone in the Cabin: I got up, and look|ing out of the Cabin Window, found the Ship was under Sail. At fir&s;t I began to be &s;urpriz'd, but yet was &s;o ignorant that I thought we were &s;ailing up the River. While I was ruminating on the Matter, the Captain came and told me my Things were ready for me, whenever I wou'd. I went out; but how was I &s;urpriz'd when I &s;aw my Trunk that I left at my Uncle's with all my Cloaths in it! I was in &s;uch Confu&s;ion that I had not Power to utter one Word for &s;ome time. At la&s;t, recovering out of my Sur|prize, I ask'd him the Meaning of what I &s;aw! Meaning, Child! reply'd the Captain: Why, what's the Matter? would you go &s;uch a Voy|age as we are upon without Nece&s;&s;aries? What Voyage? return'd I. Why, to <HI>Virginia,</HI> reply'd the Captain. At that An&s;wer I &s;at me down upon my Che&s;t and bur&s;t into Tears, and had &s;uch a Combat in my Mind that bereav'd me of the Power even of thinking for &s;ome time. The Captain indeed did all he could to comfort me: At la&s;t I fancy'd it might be only a Je&s;t; but to my Sorrow found by all their Di&s;cour&s;e it was but too much in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>The Captain declar'd that my Uncle had bar|gain'd with him for my Pa&s;&s;age, and that I was to be deliver'd to a Relation I had in <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> upon the Continent of <HI>America.</HI> I ask'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he Name, but he told me one that I had ne|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">er heard of before.</P>
<P>When I found I was certainly betray'd by my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">arbarous Uncle, I fell upon my Knees, and
<PB N="22" REF="31">
begg'd the Captain to put me on Shore, and I would find &s;ome Means to pay the Sum he was to have for my Pa&s;&s;age. He an&s;wer'd, he was too well paid already to let me go on Shore a|gain; and further added, I had nothing to do but to make my &s;elf ea&s;y, for I was not likely to &s;et my Foot in <HI>Europe,</HI> till I had fir&s;t &s;een <HI>Ame|rica.</HI></P>
<P>I found it was to no purpo&s;e to intreat any further: It is true I had no Aver&s;ion for the Sea, but rather an Inclination; and if my Uncle had made any Propo&s;als to me concerning &s;uch a Voyage, and properly prepar'd, 'tis ten to one if I had not accepted it. But in this manner to be kidnapp'd, for it was no better, and then the Dread of being parted with as a Slave when I came thither, &s;hock'd me prodigiou&s;ly. But be|ing naturally of an ea&s;y Temper, eight or ten Days pretty well wore off my Apprehen&s;ions, and I began to be contented with my wretch|ed Fate. I &s;et my &s;elf with all my Diligence to learn the Mathematicks, as al&s;o the Work of a Sailor, and quickly attain'd to &s;ome Knowledge I &s;oon ingratiated my &s;elf with mo&s;t of the Crew&punc; who in&s;tructed me in all they knew.</P>
<P>I mention'd a Book my Uncle's Clerk put in my Pocket, as I left the Chambers that Morn|ing I was trepann'd, which for the fir&s;t three or four Days I did not remember; but putting my Hand in my Pocket to feel for &s;omething el&s;e, I took it out, and found in it a Letter di|rected for me, which was as follows;</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This Letter made me cur&s;e my Fate again; for if I had had the good Fortune to have read it before I was on Ship-board, I might have prevented my Uncle's De&s;ign: But it was my De&s;tiny, and therefore I &s;ubmitted to it.</P>
<P>We met with nothing in our Voyage till we came near the <HI>Canaries:</HI> When one Evening we heard &s;everal Cannons fir'd, as we &s;uppos'd two Leagues from us. Our Captain alter'd his Cour&s;e, in order to avoid a Rencounter with an Enemy; for our Ship carry'd but ten Guns and twenty Men, be&s;ides Pa&s;&s;engers. But notwith&s;tanding the Captain's Care, as &s;oon as ever the Morning dawn'd and the Fog was clear'd up, we found our &s;elves within half a Mile of a Rover of <HI>Bar|bary.</HI> We were all mightily &s;urpriz'd, for the Gally made up to us with Sails and Oars, being to Windward of us. Our Captain advis'd us to &s;urrender immediately, but the Sailors were for fighting, and were confirm'd in their Opinion upon Sight of another Ve&s;&s;el bearing down up|on us, whom they knew to be <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> by her Colours. All our Guns were immediately brought to the Starboard Side, and every Body ready to engage, Pa&s;&s;engers and all who were willing to pre&s;erve their Liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="33">
The Rover by this time was ju&s;t upon the Starboard Bow, and prepar'd to board us. We had &s;ome Hand Granadoes on board, with &s;eve|ral other Stores for our Fort at <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> and a Gunner as one of our Pa&s;&s;engers. He or|dered &s;everal Men into our Main-Top with Gra|nadoes, and follow'd him&s;elf, and as &s;oon as ever the Gally came near enough, our Men at the Helm bore away, and fir'd our Guns upon him, which rak'd 'em fore and aft, and did much Execution. Our Gunner above in the Top threw in upon them with his Granadoes, which we could per|ceive put them into much Confu&s;ion. But all this would not have avail'd, if they had not per|ceiv'd the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of War bearing upon us. They did not make any farther Attempts to board us, but they fir'd their Cannon and gaul'd us with their &s;mall Arms.</P>
<P>I had gotten a Musket on board and had di&s;|charg'd it as I thought, for it fla&s;h'd in the Pan, and the Noi&s;e of the other Pieces deceiv'd me. I charg'd again, but then found by the Ram|mer that my Piece had not gone off. Howe|ver I was re&s;olv'd to fire it: I &s;tood upon the larboard Gunnel ju&s;t upon the Foreca&s;tle, to be as far from the Enemy as I could, and fir'd my Piece; but being double charg'd, and a &s;tub|born Jade, gave me &s;uch a Bang that threw me over the Side of our Ship; my Foot hung in the Fore Change for &s;ome time, but &s;truggling (with my Head downwards) to rai&s;e my &s;elf up, my Foot di&s;entangled, and I fell plum into the Sea.</P>
<P>Altho' I had learnt to &s;wim in <HI>England,</HI> yet the Fright, the Smoke and all together took away my Under&s;tanding, and I found by my Strug|ling that I had got within ten Yards of the Rover, and &s;he that In&s;tant bearing away before the Wind, they did me the Favour to &s;tun me
<PB N="25" REF="34">
with a Stroke of one of their Oars, and took me on board them.</P>
<P>They row'd with all their Strength, and the Wind being in their Stern, they in&s;en&s;ibly left the <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> who flatted their Sails and laid by till the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship came up with her, and then we could perceive 'em both making after the Rover.</P>
<P>The Captain of the Cor&s;air was an <HI>Iri&s;h Re|negado,</HI> and as &s;oon as he was out of Danger, he &s;ent for me into the Cabin, and ask'd me &s;e|veral Que&s;tions concerning our Ship, where &s;he was bound, and who I was, (for he took me for more than a common Sailor, being I was not in a Sailor's Habit.) I told him my Story, as I have related in the foregoing Sheets. He &s;hook his Head, and, with a Smile, &s;aid I was very ready at a Lie. Sir, &s;aid I, I am &s;o far from lying, that I jump'd overboard on purpo&s;e to come to your Ve&s;&s;el rather than to &s;tay with them, chu&s;ing to be a Slave nearer home, than to go I don't know where with the Knave that trepann'd me: And to convince your Honour of the Truth (for I <HI>honour'd</HI> him much) here's the Letter which my Uncle's Clerk &s;lipp'd into my Pocket in a Book, (for by good Fortune I had the Letter and Book in my Pocket when I fell overboard.) At rea|ding the Letter he was convinc'd, he &s;aid, of my Sincerity; and thou &s;halt &s;ee, added he, notwith&s;tanding the bad Opinion is held of us <HI>Renegado's,</HI> that you &s;hall fare the better for your Confidence in us. Sir, return'd I, this Acci|dent may convince you that I thought very well of your Honour, for as &s;oon as I &s;aw your Honour upon Deck giving Command, I thought you had the Look of a Gentleman; (tho' by the By he had a damn'd <HI>Tyburn</HI> Face.)</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="35">
I clarkt him up &s;o well (with <HI>your Honour)</HI> that he began to fancy him&s;elf a Hero indeed. He order'd my Chains to be taken off, (for they had done me the Favour to provide me &s;ome a&s;&s;oon as ever they had got me on board) and told me that if I would turn <HI>Mahometan</HI> I &s;hould have Command under him. I an&s;wer'd him, I hop'd he would give me &s;ome Time to con&s;ider of it. Ay, ay, Time, thou &s;halt have half a Year's Time to con&s;ider of it, return'd the Captain. He carry'd me out upon Deck, and told my Story to his Crew, who were mightily pleas'd with the Relation, and &s;aluted me after the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> manner, by bowing their Heads, and clapping their Hands acro&s;s upon their Brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal other <HI>Engli&s;h Renegado's</HI> that were Officers in the Galley, but mo&s;t of the common Sailors were natural <HI>Moors.</HI> The Captain told me that he did de&s;ign to make for <HI>Sallee</HI> with all the Expedition he could, for he had engag'd with a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of War the Night before, and had &s;uffer'd very much in both his Ve&s;&s;el and Crew: but he told me he would &s;oon be out again, for he had another Ve&s;&s;el ready in <HI>Sallee</HI> Road to put out to Sea. We had before Night lo&s;t Sight of the <HI>Suc|ce&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of War, that had &s;o lucki|ly freed her from the Infidels Clutches; and we &s;teer'd for <HI>Sallee.</HI></P>
<P>Ten Days after we di&s;cover'd the <HI>African</HI> Shore, within five Leagues We&s;t of <HI>Sallee</HI> Road; and the Wind favouring us, we anchor'd in the Har|bour by Six in the Evening. The Captain went a&s;hore, but ordered me to remain on Board till the next Day.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I began to have &s;ome Hopes of &s;eeing my own Country again, but yet did
<PB N="27" REF="36">
not know how to bring it about; however, I re&s;olv'd to tru&s;t Providence.</P>
<P>The next Morning my Ma&s;ter &s;ent for me on Shore, by a young <HI>Renegado</HI> Sailor born at <HI>London,</HI> who&s;e Chri&s;tian Name I learnt was <HI>Francis Corbet,</HI> but had exchang'd it for <HI>Mu&s;ta|pha;</HI> a good intelligent young Fellow, and one that was a perfect Ma&s;ter of the Mathematicks. The Rea&s;on why he did not accompany the Captain in this Voyage, was a violent Fever when he &s;et Sail. I ask'd him why he could forget the Saviour of the World to turn <HI>Maho|metan;</HI> he told me that he was only one from the Teeth outward, and he thought it better to tru&s;t God with his Soul, than tho&s;e barba|rous Wretches with his Body. I thought it was a pretty free Declaration to one that was an ut|ter Stranger to him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we were landed, I had the whole Town of <HI>Sallee</HI> &s;taring at me; for the Captain of the Rover had taken Care to &s;pread my Sto|ry among 'em; and I had as much Re&s;pect &s;hown me by the People of the Town as he had. He took me home to his own Hou&s;e, and us'd me with much Civility for a Week or ten Days; during that time he had carry'd me twice or thrice to his Country Hou&s;e, about &s;ix Miles up the River. It was a very plea&s;ant Place, &s;itua|ted in a little Wood, with the River running round it, and no approaching to it but over a Draw-bridge. At this Hou&s;e his Wives liv'd, for I was inform'd he had &s;everal.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving his Garden, I told him it was but indifferently kept. He an&s;wer'd it was for want of a Gardener, none of his Slaves under&s;tanding that Art. I offer'd him my Service, but told him I did not pretend to be a Gardiner, but I was a&s;&s;ur'd I could &s;oon make Amendment to it,
<PB N="28" REF="37">
with the Help of &s;ome of his Servants. He or|der'd me to take as many as I thought fit, and, added he, becau&s;e I am impatient to &s;ee it in a better condition, I'll leave you here. I told him I begg'd to be excus'd now, becau&s;e I &s;hould want &s;everal Things for my De&s;igns. If it be Tools, &s;aid he, or Seeds of all Sorts, I have 'em here. Upon which he carry'd me into a little Hou&s;e, meant for a Green-hou&s;e, where I found every Thing that was wanting, with a large Quantity of <HI>European</HI> Seeds and Roots. I told him I was &s;atisfy'd there was e|very thing that I &s;hould want. The Captain order'd me a Bed to be made in the Green-hou&s;e, and an old Eunuch, that under&s;tood <HI>French</HI> very well, to wait on me, with a &s;trict Order that I &s;hould have every Thing I ask'd for, but I was not to approach the Hou&s;e in his Ab&s;ence upon any Account. I told him I had no Curi|o&s;ity that way, and did not doubt but I &s;hould &s;how him &s;omething that would plea&s;e him the next time he came, which was to be in 20 Days.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone I went to Work, (for Gardening was what I always took delight in, both Theoric and Practic.)</P>
<P>I drew out Plans, order'd my Workmen, and in &s;ix Days time brought it into &s;ome Form. I perceiv'd in the middle of the Garden a Pud|dle of Water, which I gave Directions to be drain'd, and found that it had been formerly a Fountain, but was only choak'd up with Filth by Neglect. I ask'd the old Eunuch if he had ever known it to play, and he an&s;wer'd in the negative, neither did they imagine it to be any &s;uch thing; for his Ma&s;ter had bought the E|&s;tate of an old <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Renegado four Years be|fore, and he told him it had been a Fi&s;h-Pond. I examin'd about the River, and found the Head
<PB N="29" REF="38">
of the Pipes &s;topp'd with Rubbi&s;h, which I clear'd, and by degrees the Water work'd thro' into the Fountain, and out again thro' another Conveyance. I ob&s;erv'd that there had been Fi|gures upon it, by the Pipes; I ask'd my Eunuch if he had ever &s;een any &s;uch things: He told me there were &s;everal lying in a back Yard on the other Side the Hou&s;e. I went with him, and found four &s;mall Figures of <HI>Tritons,</HI> and a <HI>Nep|tune</HI> in his Chariot drawn by Sea-Hor&s;es. I or|der'd them to be brought to the Fountain, and fixt them on, (fir&s;t &s;topping the Water) and then letting it loo&s;e again fini&s;h'd my Fountain, which plaid admirably out of the Shells of the <HI>Tritons,</HI> (which they &s;eem'd to blow with) from the No&s;trils of the Hor&s;es, and the Trident of the <HI>Neptune.</HI> The Workmen were a&s;toni&s;h'd to &s;ee with what Ex|pedition I had compleated it, and imagin'd I had dealt with the Devil. The next Morning the Eunuch came to me before I was up, and de|&s;ir'd I'd give him the Key of my Chamber, and be contented to be a Pri&s;oner till he came to me again. I was a little &s;urpriz'd, and ask'd him the Rea&s;on: He told me he could not give me any, being it was beyond his Commi&s;&s;ion. Ac|cordingly he lock'd me in, and went away. I began to ruminate about this Accident, but could not imagine the Cau&s;e: I had no Way to look out towards the Garden, being the Windows of the Green-hou&s;e look'd over the River into the Wood, and the Back which front|ted the Hou&s;e had only painted Windows for Ornament, not U&s;e. In about two Hours my Eunuch came and releas'd me, and we din'd to|gether. I us'd all the Rhetoric I was Ma&s;ter of to find out the Secret, but to no Purpo&s;e; he only added that I mu&s;t be in the &s;ame Con|dition again the next Morning. This was &s;till
<PB N="30" REF="39">
more &s;urprizing, and I began to think by De|grees I &s;hould entirely lo&s;e my Liberty. The old Eunuch imagining my Thoughts, a&s;&s;ur'd me there was no harm meant to me. This Af|ternoon was my la&s;t Day's Work, and in three Days more I expected the Captain. About an Hour before Night I perceiv'd another Eunuch of the Hou&s;e talking earne&s;tly with him that us'd to attend me, who immediately came to me, and told me he mu&s;t beg me to retire to my Chamber that In&s;tant; upon which I readi|ly obey'd, knowing it was to no purpo&s;e to contend.</P>
<P>I was upon the Tenters to know the Rea|&s;on of my Confinement: Whil&s;t I was employ|ing my Thoughts about it, I heard the Voices of Women. It &s;urpriz'd me at fir&s;t, but I &s;oon &s;ound that was the Rea&s;on of my being made a Pri&s;oner. When the Eunuch came to bring me my Supper, I told him he need not have made &s;uch a Secret of what I was lock'd up for, for I had found it out; and then told him that I had heard Women's Voices in the Gar|den. Did you? (&s;aid he, &s;urpriz'd) I'll take Care they &s;hall keep their Tongues within their Teeth for the future. He &s;aid no more, but immedi|ately went out, and &s;oon return'd and told me I &s;hould hear no more of them. I was con|founded with this odd Proceeding, and my Cu|rio&s;ity began to be more and more rais'd.</P>
<P>When I was left alone, I began to examine my Room where I was, to &s;ee if I could find ever a Peep-hole; and by good Fortune found one made by Time and ill Weather under the Pent-hou&s;e. I upon the in&s;tant of my Di&s;co|very made all the U&s;e I could of it, and &s;oon perceiv'd three Women in the Walk with their Backs towards me. They were in a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Un|dre&s;s,
<PB N="31" REF="40">
with their Necks bare: One of them a|bove the re&s;t &s;eem'd to me to have a better Shape and Air than commonly the Women of <HI>Moroc|co</HI> have. I don't know what came over me, but I &s;eem'd impatiently to expect their nearer Ap|proach. At la&s;t my De&s;ires were an&s;wer'd; for a&s;&s;oon as they had &s;pent &s;ome Time at my new Fountain, they directed their Steps towards my Confinement, and when they were near enough, I could di&s;tingui&s;h them to be three hand&s;ome Women; but one of 'em that &s;eem'd to be ve|ry melancholy, &s;urpa&s;s'd the other two, at lea&s;t in my Opinion. She &s;eem'd to be about twen|ty, fair to a Miracle, and much like an <HI>Engli&s;h|woman.</HI> She did not &s;eem to conver&s;e with the other two, but follow'd them with an Air of Contemplation; and I could ob&s;erve her &s;igh of|ten. I never till this Moment had the lea&s;t Re|gard to any of the Female Sex, no more than good Manners and Decency requir'd; but I found my &s;elf in a Moment full of aching Tenderne&s;s for this &s;trange Woman. Though I had no time for Thought till the Ladies were retir'd, I then began to rea&s;on with my &s;elf, and found Love like De&s;tiny was not to be avoided; and the more I thought, the more I was plung'd in this tormenting, yet plea&s;ing Pa&s;&s;ion. Yet I thought it was very odd to fall in Love, con&s;idering my Circum&s;tances. I had nothing to hope, and all to fear: I was poor, a Pri&s;oner, and a Stranger, far from my native Country, in want even of Nece&s;&s;aries, and, to compleat my Mi&s;ery, &s;unk in one Hour an Age in Love. Every new Thought &s;eem'd a Thorn to torment me; yet notwith&s;tand|ing all the&s;e Difficulties, a Beam of Hope would now and then &s;hine thro' the thick Clouds of De&s;pair, and encourage me to love on. From this Thought I began to think with Rea&s;on (if
<PB N="32" REF="41">
a Lover can be call'd a rea&s;onable Creature) how I &s;hould manage my Pa&s;&s;ion. I began to reflect the <HI>Moors</HI> were jealous of their Women even to a Degree, and did not in the lea&s;t doubt but my <HI>Iri&s;h Renegado</HI> had learnt that Part of their Manners. At la&s;t I pitch'd upon an odd Expe|dient: I determin'd to &s;hew to my Captain an utter Dete&s;tation of all Females, (and in truth the U&s;age my poor Ma&s;ter met with from his Wife, very much le&s;&s;en'd the Regard I ow'd the Sex) and try what that would do. This Thought &s;eem'd to give me &s;ome Satisfaction, and a&s;&s;oon as the Eunuch came to relea&s;e me, I begg'd he would &s;up with me that Evening. He accordingly promis'd me, and came immedi|ately with my Supper, and brought under his Garment a Bottle of excellent <HI>Greek</HI> Wine. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was &s;urpriz'd and pleas'd; for as I knew the <HI>Moors</HI> are re&s;train'd from Wine, I did not expect any there. The Eunuch told me, &s;miling, that he had brought that Cordial to make me Amends for the Lo&s;s of my Liberty; for though, added he, <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmen</HI> are not allow'd to drink Wine, we very well know you <HI>Euro|peans</HI> &s;eldom eat without it; and our Ma&s;ter (meaning the Captain) is not &s;o &s;trict a <HI>Mu&s;&s;ul|man</HI> but he drinks much him&s;elf, and procures privately great Quantities for his own U&s;e. I told him, I thought <HI>Mahomet</HI> order'd his Fol|lowers to ab&s;tain from Wine, becau&s;e an immo|derate U&s;e of it generally turn'd to immoderate Pa&s;&s;ions; but to take it &s;paringly gave Health and Vigour to the Body, and Chearfulne&s;s to the Spirits. He agreed with me in my Senti|ments, and &s;how'd he approv'd of them by drink|ing to me. Notwith&s;tanding my Endeavours to hide the Trouble of my Spirit, my kind Eu|nuch took Notice of a Concern in my Counte|nance,
<PB N="33" REF="42">
and chear'd me up with repeated Gla&s;&s;es; and imagining my Confinement caus'd that Al|teration, told me he would not have me take to Heart the &s;mall Abridgement of my Liberty, for a&s;&s;oon as his Ma&s;ter arriv'd, I &s;hould not be re|&s;train'd any more; for the Cau&s;e would cea&s;e, by the Confinement of the Ladies to their &s;everal A|partments. I told him, with a &s;eeming Joy, that I &s;hould be mightily pleas'd when that &s;hould happen, for I abhorr'd the Sight of them; Wo|men were my utter Aver&s;ion, and had been from my Infancy; and that Aver&s;ion was aggravated by the Knowledge of their Perfidy; and I thought it the greate&s;t Cur&s;e could fall upon that noble Creature Man not to be born with|out them. Upon this I told him the Story of my Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;everal extravagant Tales of my own Invention, which painted that beautiful Part of the Creation in the Colour of the Devil. My Companion prais'd me for &s;light|ing the Sex, and back'd my Stories with as many of his own Knowledge. Between our familiar Talk and our <HI>Greek</HI> Wine, he be|gan to be very loquacious: He told me, his Ma&s;ter, after the Mode of the <HI>Moors,</HI> had &s;eve|ral Wives, be&s;ide a Captive that he had lately taken, that &s;eem'd aver&s;e to his Pa&s;&s;ion, and all the Rhetoric he was Ma&s;ter of could not pre|vail. He did not know, he &s;aid, what Country|woman &s;he was, but &s;he &s;poke very good <HI>French.</HI> I imagin'd this could be no other than that &s;weet Creature I had &s;een: I chang'd Colour; but to put it off &s;aid, A Pox take all the Sex, don't let's talk of them any more. I am afraid, &s;aid he, you love to conver&s;e with the Men, and that makes you &s;light the Women. I did not imme|diately under&s;tand him, but he &s;oon explain'd upon it, and then I was no longer ignorant. I told
<PB N="34" REF="43">
him it was of &s;uch a bea&s;tly Nature, that I was of Opinion tho&s;e Per&s;ons that us'd it &s;hould be treated wor&s;e than Bea&s;ts. Why, reply'd he, it is &s;o common here that 'tis reckon'd only a Piece of Gallantry. Well, &s;aid I, I hate that Action, even wor&s;e if it be po&s;&s;ible than the Sight of the Female Sex. The old Man and I parted like two Friends; but before he went, I told him he need not give him&s;elf any great Trou|ble to lock me in for the future, for I would take Care of my &s;elf. Well, well, &s;aid he, and &s;hook his Head, I believe I may tru&s;t you. As &s;oon as he was gone I went to Bed, not to Sleep, for I had Thought enough about me to keep me waking. I began to conceive a great deal of Hopes from my Di&s;&s;imulation. I &s;pent the whole Night in thinking of a thou&s;and Expedients to forward my De&s;igns, till I had thought of &s;o many that they were all confus'd like a Skein of Silk pull'd the wrong way. At la&s;t with the Fatigue of Thought I fell a&s;leep till Sun-ri&s;ing, nor awak'd till I heard Voices in the Garden. I ran immediately and barr'd my Door on the In&s;ide, for fear of being di&s;covered at my Peep|hole, huddled on my Cloaths, and ran up; where I &s;aw my lovely Charmer reading in a Book, walking by her &s;elf in the Alley that led to my Pri&s;on. The other Women were got about the Fountain, admiring the playing of the Water. She drew nearer me; but what was my plea&s;ing Surprize when I heard her repeat the following Lines in <HI>Engli&s;h!</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>&mdash;My Grief lies all within,</L>
<L>And tho&s;e external manners of Laments</L>
<L>Are meely Shadows to the un&s;een Grief</L>
<L>That &s;wells with Silence in my tortur'd Soul.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="35" REF="44">
I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the Tran&s;ports I felt were be|yond Expre&s;&s;ion: She had &s;uch a Softne&s;s in her Voice, and yet &s;o mu&s;ical, that it made my Blood thrill thro' my Veins. In &s;hort, during the time I beheld her, I was in &s;uch an Ec&s;ta&s;ie, that all my Cares were forgot. She turn'd up the Walk again, but I follow'd her with my longing Eyes till &s;he was out of Sight: I then turn'd them into my Imagination, and there beheld her &s;till.</P>
<P>I was convinc'd &s;he was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woman, and kept in her Re&s;traint again&s;t her Will. I &s;oon re&s;olv'd with my &s;elf to find &s;ome Expedi|ent to let her know I would &s;erve her all that lay in my Power, if &s;he was di&s;pos'd to accept it.</P>
<P>I had &s;taid &s;o long fixt at my Peep-hole, that the old Eunuch knock'd at my Door, which &s;oon rouz'd me from my plea&s;ing Thoughts, and put me upon another Task, which was to di&s;&s;emble. I &s;uffer'd him to knock twice or thrice before I let him in; at la&s;t I open'd the Door, when he had call'd to me to give me to know who it was: A&s;&s;oon as he was enter'd, I began to exclaim again&s;t him in a friendly manner; &s;aid I, You promis'd me Ye&s;terday that I &s;hould not be troubled with the Tongues of tho&s;e Female Devils, and I have been &s;o plagu'd with them for an Hour together, that I was oblig'd to &s;hut my Door, and run up Stairs to be free from the Sound. He &s;miling told me, the Fumes of the Wine which he drank over-night had drove it out of his Thoughts, but he would be &s;ure to give them a Caution to hold their Tongues for the time to come: But then, added I, I may be &s;urpriz'd by them when I little expect 'em. No, &s;aid he, I'll take Care to &s;end, or bring you Word when they are di&s;pos'd to walk
<PB N="36" REF="45">
in the Garden again. I thank'd him for his Cau|tion. He told me he did de&s;ign to come and dine with me that Day, for, added he, I &s;hall not have another Opportunity a great while, for the Captain has &s;ent Word he'll be here to-mor|row without fail. Accordingly he came with a roa&s;ted Phea&s;ant, and &s;ome boil'd Rice, attend|ed with another Bottle of <HI>Greek</HI> Wine.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding my new Pa&s;&s;ion, I eat and drank heartily; but my Eunuch got almo&s;t tip|&s;ey, and the Fumes of the Wine getting up in|to his Head, he de&s;ir'd he might repo&s;e him&s;elf on my Bed for a while, which I granted him; well knowing if he had been found out, we might both have &s;uffer'd for ta&s;ting the Juice of the Grape. I had much rather he had gone within the Hou&s;e to have &s;lept, for I could not even think to the purpo&s;e while he was there: But he &s;oon got into a &s;ound Sleep, which I found out by his Snoreing. I then ventur'd to take Pen and Ink, and wrote the following Lines.</P>

<P>I had not the Conveniency of Sealing-wax or Wafer, therefore I folded it up, and directed it <HI>To the</HI> ENGLISH LADY. When I had fini&s;h'd, I began to have odd and confus'd Notions of the Succe&s;s of it: Perhaps, &s;aid I to my &s;elf, &s;he may be contented with her Fortune, or be afraid to hazard any Attempt towards her Liberty: She may al&s;o imagine I am &s;et on purpo&s;e to betray her, and therefore to &s;hew her Innocency may di&s;cover me to the Captain. I was in a hundred Minds: Sometimes I re&s;olv'd to burn the Letter; but at la&s;t Love prevail'd upon all my Rea&s;ons to the contrary, and I re&s;olv'd to try the Suc|ce&s;s of it the fir&s;t Opportunity.</P>
<P>In rea&s;oning with my &s;elf, and writing my Letter, I had &s;pent three Hours, and therefore I thought it high time to awake my Eunuch, who &s;tarted up frighted out of his Sen&s;es. When he had recover'd him&s;elf, he thank'd me for break|ing his Re&s;t, for he was a&s;&s;ur'd he was wanted within. And he nick'd his Time to a hair, for before he was got half way the Walk (for I im|mediately got up to my Peep-hole) I &s;aw the Ladies at the farther End. He talk'd to them &s;ome time, and then left them, to go into the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>They &s;aunter'd about the Garden a good while, till at la&s;t two of them &s;at down by the Foun|tain, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lady continued her Walk towards my Apartment. Now my Blood ran its &s;wift Cour&s;e, and the whole Frame of my Body felt violent Emotions. I thought this was a fair Opportunity, and yet was fearful to make U&s;e on't. But mu&s;tring all my Spirits, I ventured,
<PB N="38" REF="47">
and when &s;he was within twenty Paces of the Green-hou&s;e, I darted the Letter, and by good Fortune it fell in the Middle of the Gravel-Walk, &s;o that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;s on't; but had it happened otherwi&s;e, I had time enough to run down and take it up before any one el&s;e could di&s;cover it. She continued her Walk, and when &s;he came at it, &s;he kick'd it with her Foot, once or twice, and at la&s;t took it up. She was reading in a Book, as &s;he was the Day before; I could perceive her open it, and &s;pread the Note upon her Book, &s;o that no one could tell but that &s;he was reading. It is not po&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Anxiety I lay under all this while: But I began to be a little more com|pos'd, when I ob&s;erved her tearing the Letter into very &s;mall Pieces, and &s;cattering them in &s;everal Places of the Garden. She had not walk'd far, but &s;he return'd, and view'd the Green-hou&s;e with a great deal of Regard, and, to my Imagination, wanted to come to the North Side of it, as mention'd in the Note, yet &s;eem'd fearful; often looking back, and not fully confirmed in her Re&s;olution, at la&s;t went unwil|lingly to the re&s;t of the Ladies. This gave me &s;ome Hopes that &s;he received the Letter kindly, and that I &s;hould hear from her &s;oon.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved &s;he &s;at by the Fountain very intent upon her Book, which did not much plea&s;e me. In about a quarter of an Hour, &s;he got up, and came towards the Green-hou&s;e again. When I &s;aw her coming, I ran down Stairs, and fix'd a Packthread to the top of the Window, for fear if &s;he &s;hould take Courage, and come to that Side, not &s;eeing the Packthread, &s;he might be &s;tartled, and per&s;uade her &s;elf there was nothing in't. I had plac'd it, and got to my Peep-hole before &s;he had reached the South Side. But
<PB N="39" REF="48">
coming clo&s;e to the Wall, I could not &s;ee her by rea&s;on the &s;mallne&s;s of the Hole cut off my Sight. But in le&s;s than a Minute I di&s;cover'd her walking back again, and &s;ometimes turning to view the Place of my Retirement. A&s;&s;oon as &s;he had got to the Top of the Walk, (for I had not Power to &s;tir before) I went down, and pulling in the Packthread, found a Piece of Pa|per ty'd to it. I unty'd it with a great deal of Expectation and Impatience, and found the&s;e Words wrote with a Pencil, upon a clean Leaf of a Book (which I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he had torn from that &s;he had been reading in.)</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> Was much &s;urpri&s;ed when I peru&s;ed a Note, I found in the Walk of the Garden, as believing it directed to me. I confe&s;s I am a Per&s;on in Di&s;tre&s;s, but know not how to take the Word of a Stranger, and one I never &s;aw, who perhaps is no more than a Spy upon my Actions, and what the Note contain|ed may be by Order of him who pretends to tyrannize over me, becau&s;e I am in his Power; and &s;eeks this Way to find out my Inclination, for Pretences to u&s;e me wor&s;e. Therefore I'll expect a farther A&s;&s;urance in half an Hour from the &s;ame Place. And I'll take an Opportunity to convey my real Sentiments back again.</P>
<P>The Joy I felt at reading this Note cannot be expre&s;s'd in Words. I &s;at me down and wrote the following An&s;wer.</P>

<P>When I had wrote this I went to the u&s;ual Place, and &s;aw my Charmer very near me. I threw it down as before; &s;he readily took it up, and walk'd back again, tearing the Note when &s;he had read it, as &s;he did the former, and went into the Hou&s;e. Ju&s;t as &s;he was got within the Gate the other Eunuch came out (not my friend|ly Eunuch) and as he was walking along, I ob|&s;erved him picking up the Pieces of the torn Notes. If any one had ob&s;erved my Countenance at this Action, they might have di&s;covered the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion there. I thought we were cer|tainly undone, and could not tell how to behave my &s;elf. I &s;ometimes repented of the Affair, but yet I always found my Concern was more for her whom I lov'd, than for my &s;elf. A&s;&s;oon as he had pick'd up all he could find, he return'd, with my hearty Cur&s;e, and Wi&s;hes that he might be obliged to &s;wallow them down his Throat for a Penance.</P>
<P>I don't know when I &s;hould have recovered out of my fit of Confu&s;ion, if the Sight of my Bli&s;s had not done it. She went to the Fountain, &s;at her down upon the Margin, and &s;pent &s;ome time there, then ro&s;e and made to my Apartment; &s;he took two or three Turns with a Book in her Hand, but at la&s;t went out of Sight, as before.

Pieces of Paper about the Garden, well knowing it could be only &s;he that had don't, becau&s;e the re&s;t were all <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and know the Virtue of it. I ask'd the Rea&s;on of all this Bu&s;tle, about a Thing we <HI>Europeans</HI> put to the mo&s;t &s;ervile U&s;es. He told me with &s;ome Intreaty at la&s;t, that all true <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmen</HI> have a great deal of Regard for Bits of Paper, becau&s;e the Name of God, or their Prophet, may be wrote upon it; and they have a Tradition, that when they are called out of Purgatory at the Day of Judgment, to be In|habitants of the ever-ble&s;&s;ed Man&s;ions, there will be no other Way to come to their Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> but over a large red-hot Iron Grate, which they mu&s;t walk over Barefoot. And there|fore, upon the In&s;tant as they are going to &s;tep upon the Grate, all the Pieces of Paper they have pick'd up during their Re&s;idence in this World will run and place them&s;elves of their own ac|cord under their Feet, &s;o that they will be en|abled to get to their Prophet without much Dif|ficulty.

enough to &s;peak to her; Madam, &s;aid I, I would not have you be under any Apprehen&s;ion. If I had known you had been here, I would not have di&s;turb'd you. I will only inform you, that I am the Per&s;on that has vow'd to &s;erve you to the utmo&s;t of my Power. Sir, an&s;wered &s;he, I am not at all di&s;pleas'd at this Interview which is merely Chance; on the contrary I am pleas'd to &s;ee the Per&s;on whom I once hope to be obliged to for my Liberty, and wi&s;h we could often meet, that we might con&s;ult about the Means. Madam (an&s;wered I) if you'll conde&s;cend &s;o far, I don't doubt but to find Opportunities enough. I told her of my Plot with the Eunuch, and I had &s;ome Hopes it might produce &s;omething. She ap|prov'd of my De&s;ign, and my Conduct hitherto. She added that &s;he would take hold of all Oppor|tunities to walk in the Garden (where I had in|form'd her I could &s;ee her without being &s;een) and &s;o we parted for fear of being di&s;cover'd. She went into the Hou&s;e, and I went back to my Dwelling, and in le&s;s than half an Hour the Captain arriv'd. He came to fetch me to Din|ner, and told me I had work'd by Magick, or I could never have done what I did. He told me he thought him&s;elf much obliged to me, and that I &s;hould find it. I an&s;wered him, I was con|vinc'd it was but my Duty to &s;erve him with e|very thing in my Power, and that if he pleas'd I would make farther Improvements. He made me a great many Compliments his way, and declared he would leave it to my better Judg|ment.</P>
<P>By this time Dinner was ready, and I was or|dered to &s;it down at Table with him, (for tho' he had turn'd <HI>Mahometan,</HI> yet he eat as we do in <HI>Europe,</HI> not on the Ground upon Carpets as the <HI>A&s;iatics</HI> and <HI>Africans</HI> do.) We had our Dinner dre&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="44" REF="53">
after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion, and we drank plen|tifully of his <HI>Greek</HI> Wine. He told me he had a Di&s;pen&s;ation from the <HI>Mufty</HI> to drink Wine, and &s;mil'd. I an&s;wered I believed the Crime was pardonable by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> if it was drank with Moderation. For my Part, I don't think (&s;aid I) Religion con&s;i&s;ts in Ca&s;tigation and Penance; and I am convinc'd that an upright Man, let him be <HI>Jew, Turk,</HI> or Chri&s;tian, may find his Way to Heaven. We had &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es at Din|ner about Religion, but I &s;oon di&s;cover'd the Captain knew very little of any; and I am of the Opinion there's very few of the <HI>Renegado's</HI> think of Religion: Their Motive to change is Ea&s;e and Intere&s;t. But this is a Digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When Dinner was over, we walk'd in the Garden, and I &s;how'd the Captain what Im|provements I had de&s;ign'd to make. He approv'd of every thing I &s;aid, and inform'd me that he had heard from <HI>Mirza</HI> the Eunuch my Abhor|rence of Women. But he advis'd me to keep my Sentiments &s;ecret, for when you abjure (&s;aid he) the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Women will make you feel their Re&s;entments. But 'tis odd, continu'd he, that one of your Youth and Make &s;hould take &s;uch an Aver&s;ion to the Female Sex. I told him I had very good Rea&s;ons for my Hatred, and even my Mother was odious to me, tho' &s;he brought me into the World. Well but, added the Cap|tain, Time and a Fair Face may make great Al|terations. I told him I was very well a&s;&s;ured I &s;hould carry my Re&s;entment to the Grave. I fancy (&s;aid he) I have an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woman, a Slave of mine, that I have lately taken, would make you change your Sentiments, if you &s;aw her. Sir, an|&s;wered I, I would be willing to &s;tand the Tryal to convince you of the contrary, tho' I would as &s;oon look upon a Serpent with my Will
<PB N="45" REF="54">
Well, &s;aid he, I have not learnt the Strictne&s;s of he <HI>Moors,</HI> in keeping Women without being een; or if I had, your Aver&s;ion to them would onvince me I have not much to fear. He de&s;ired me to walk a-while in the Garden, and he would be with me again immediately. Upon this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e left me, and went into the Hou&s;e, and re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">urn'd in five Minutes. Come, &s;aid he, I have order'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y Women to walk in the Garden, and you and will ab&s;cond behind the&s;e Lawrels, where we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ay &s;ee them, and not be &s;een. We had not &s;at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ong, before we could perceive three Women <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oming towards us. The two fir&s;t were very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">and&s;om, a little inclining to Fat, one &s;eem'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e about thirty, and the other twenty one accor|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to my Gue&s;s, and not &s;o fair as our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Women; but the third was &s;he I look'd for. All my Circum&s;pection could not avoid my feeling a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">udden flow of my Blood ri&s;e into my Face, which my Captain ob&s;erv'd. Well &s;aid he (when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hey were walk'd out of hearing) I have taken Notice of your Di&s;order, and perceive your real Aver&s;ion is un&s;urmountable, which I am not &s;or|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y for, being it will add to your Liberty. I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o Occa&s;ion to have you confin'd when they walk in the Garden, for I fancy (added he laugh|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ng) you'll &s;hun 'em fa&s;t enough.

<PB N="46" REF="55">
Time's expir'd, if &s;he will not con&s;ent, I am re|&s;olv'd to force her.</P>
<P>Lord (&s;aid I in a &s;eeming Pa&s;&s;ion) how can you take &s;uch an extraordinary Trouble for a thing that does not de&s;erve the lea&s;t Regard. If the re&s;t of the World were of your Mind (&s;aid my Captain) the Women would have but a &s;curvy Time on't. Now 'tis to me amazing (reply'd I) that Men &s;hould take Pains, live hard, and run all Hazards, to come home, and &s;pend all the Fruits of their Labour on &s;uch Trifles, that per|haps have not the lea&s;t Tenderne&s;s for 'em, e&s;pe|cially in the&s;e hot Counties where Women are given to be amorous, and yet have but one Man to &s;ometimes a Dozen of them and more; when perhaps a dozen Men would hardly &s;atisfy one Woman. Why (reply'd my Captain) that's the Rea&s;on they are &s;o &s;trictly guarded, we pretty well know what they expect. Now, if I had not had this Aver&s;ion to Women (I re|turn'd) I have a Secret without Witchcraft, to make a Woman doat upon a Man. How, &s;aid the Captain, have you &s;uch a Secret? if you'll let me know it, I will not only give you your Li|berty, but amply reward you be&s;ides. Sir, &s;aid I, I thank you; but as for di&s;clo&s;ing the Secret, it is what I never can do; yet 'tis in my Power to prepare you a chymical Liquid, which put into White-wine will do the Bu&s;ine&s;s, though it will take up a great deal of Time, and be very expen&s;ive. As for the Expence, reply'd the Cap|tain, I &s;han't value it. But in how long Time can it be done? Not under one hundred Days af|ter Projection, an&s;wer'd I. Upon this he paus'd &s;ome Time; A hundred Days is a great while, yet I think 'tis better to wait for her Con&s;ent than to force her. So far (&s;aid I) I think you are in the right; and further (added I) you may continue
<PB N="47" REF="56">
her Affection, as long as you think fit, by now and then adding &s;ome of the chymical Drops into any Liquid &s;he &s;hall drink, after &s;he has taken the fir&s;t Pre&s;cription.</P>
<P>The Captain &s;eem'd mightily pleas'd with my Project, and ask'd me what the Charge would be. I an&s;wer'd, I fear'd it would be about two hun|dred Pounds in this Country, tho' it would be much cheaper in <HI>England,</HI> where the things that I &s;hould want were ea&s;ier to be had; but I told him I could not give a ju&s;t Account of the Charge, till I &s;aw the Prices of the Things I &s;hou'd want. I told him I was afraid I &s;hould find it a difficult thing to get a <HI>Still,</HI> for that was the fir&s;t thing I &s;hould want. He an&s;wer'd me, he did not que&s;tion but I &s;hould ea&s;ily procure every thing I wanted for Money, and he would take care I &s;hould not &s;tand in need of that. He farther told me that &s;everal <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Sallee</HI> had all manner of Drugs, and he believ'd every thing el&s;e that I &s;hould want. (For fear of the wor&s;t) I told him, I &s;hould not want my Drugs the&s;e fifty Days, tho' I &s;hould want the <HI>Still</HI> immedi|ately, and Liberty to go into the neighbouring Woods in the Night-time, being there were &s;e|veral Herbs that I mu&s;t gather by Moon-light, and when the Moon was in its Full, in the In|crea&s;e, or Decrea&s;e, according to the Nature of the Herb I wanted. He told me I &s;hould have all the Liberty I required, not doubting I would make any wrong U&s;e of it. I told him, to be more &s;ecure, he might &s;end who he thought fit, to guard me. No, return'd he, I'll leave you to your &s;elf. But you may take who you will with you of my Servants, if you want their A&s;&s;i&s;tance. I told him I &s;hould &s;tand in need of &s;ome of 'em &s;ometimes. Well, &s;aid he, you &s;hall go up with me, and take what Money you have Occa&s;ion
<PB N="48" REF="57">
for. So accordingly we went into a little Clo&s;et, where was a &s;trong Box, which he open'd, and took out two hundred and fifty <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pi&s;toles; &s;aid he, if there is not enough, you may have more. I told him I was a&s;&s;ur'd there was too much. Well, &s;aid he, we'll reckon after the Affair is over. And becau&s;e it will be &s;o long about, I'll e'en take another crui&s;ing Voyage, that I may not think the Time tedious. I was very glad to hear him &s;ay &s;o, becau&s;e I &s;hould have the bet|ter Opportunity to work my De&s;ign. Tho' I di&s;&s;embled my Joy, and told him I &s;hould be &s;or|ry for that, for I &s;hould often have &s;omething or other to give the Woman he de&s;ign'd me to work upon. Well (&s;aid he) <HI>Mirza</HI> &s;hall take your Directions. Upon &s;aying this he call'd <HI>Mirza</HI> to us; <HI>Mirza,</HI> &s;aid the Captain, you mu&s;t ob&s;erve this Per&s;on's Orders; whatever he commands you to do, you mu&s;t obey with as much Exactne&s;s as if you were &s;erving of me. This he told <HI>Mirza</HI> in the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Tongue, but explain'd it to me in <HI>Engli&s;h. Mirza</HI> al&s;o told me in <HI>French</HI> the Com|mi&s;&s;ion his Ma&s;ter had given him, and farther ad|ded, he hop'd I would often command him to vi&s;it the Wine Cellar. I told him we would not want. I advis'd the Captain to let me go to Town, to enquire for the Still as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and to be known to tho&s;e People that &s;old the Drugs. Why if you will (reply'd the Captain) we'll go immediately; upon which I con&s;ented. He or|dered a Hor&s;e to be &s;adled for me, and I went into the Green-hou&s;e to prepare my &s;elf; and luckily for me I did, for I found a Note fixed to the String, which my fair Corre&s;pondent had taken Opportunity of leaving, when &s;he walked in the Garden by the Captain's Order. The Contents were as follows.</P>

<P>How lucky was it for me to find this Note! It might have fell into the Captain's Hands, and then we had been in a fine Condition. I had Time to write but a &s;hort An&s;wer, which I threw on the Ground, and pull'd in my String; it was this, <HI>Hope every Thing: Write no more till to-morrow.</HI> I lock'd my Door, and took the Key with me.</P>
<P>When we were on Hor&s;eback, our chief Di&s;|cour&s;e was concerning Charms, Philtres, and Witchcraft. I convinc'd him there was not any &s;uch thing in the World; and my Compound was the only thing that could do what was de&s;ir'd. He ask'd me if I my &s;elf had ever try'd the Experiment: I told him more than once; and related the following Tale to him off hand.</P>
<P>There liv'd in our Neighbourhood a rich old Man and very amorous, but deformed to the la&s;t De|gree: He was round-&s;houlder'd, broad-fac'd, blear|eye'd, &s;hort-no&s;ed, and his Mouth as wide as his Face was broad; a pretty Object as one &s;hou'd &s;ee. This old Gentleman fell in Love with a very pret|ty Woman, a Mercer's Daughter over-again&s;t him,
<PB N="50" REF="59">
but &s;eem'd to be the very Offspring of Pride, and nothing le&s;s than a Lord &s;hou'd be her Hu&s;|band, being well a&s;&s;ur'd her Charms would con|quer every one that look'd upon her. She could not bear the thoughts of the old Gentleman, and whenever he talk'd of his Pa&s;&s;ion treated him &s;o ill that he was almo&s;t di&s;tracted. I went to vi&s;it him one Day, as I often us'd to do, for before his Love-Fit he was wont to be very good Company, and would make as free with his Deformity as any Body el&s;e would do; but I found him now in &s;uch a Condition that I began to pity him. I us'd all the Arguments I was capable of to bring him to Rea&s;on, but it was the &s;ame thing as to &s;tem a Torrent. At la&s;t I call'd to Mind this Elixir, which I had ne|ver try'd before this Occa&s;ion; I was pretty well convinc'd of its Virtue from what I &s;aw it was compos'd of, though the chief Ingredient is cal|cin'd Gold.</P>
<P>This wonderful <HI>Arcanum</HI> was found out by an Uncle of mine that had &s;tudied the Secrets of Nature &s;ixty Years. When he was dying he call'd me to him, and gave it me in Writing, with the mo&s;t &s;acred Conjuration that I &s;hould never reveal it, nor cau&s;e it to be wrote till I thought my la&s;t Hour near, and to de&s;troy that which he gave me in ten Days, for fear it &s;hould be found by Accident, and that ten Days would be &s;ufficient to imprint it in my Memory; I give it into your Hands, &s;aid my dying Uncle, becau&s;e I find thy Under&s;tanding exceeds thy Years, and thy Aver&s;ion for Women will never let thee make an ill U&s;e of the valuable Secret; and fur|ther added, that the Charge would deter me from doing it upon any &s;light Occa&s;ion. I took it from him with a &s;acred Promi&s;e not to di&s;clo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> it, till on my Death-Bed; for if my Uncle had
<PB N="51" REF="60">
recover'd I mu&s;t have deliver'd it up to him a|gain: But he expir'd in half an Hour.</P>
<P>I &s;o far pitied the old Gentleman (and al&s;o having a De&s;ire to try the Experiment) that I told him I had it in my Power to make the La|dy as fond of him as Love could wi&s;h, if he would go to the Charge. He told me he did not value the Expence, but he had no Faith in Charms. I convinc'd him at la&s;t, went to work, and ac|compli&s;h'd my Affair. The Quantity I made would &s;erve a hundred Years, and I had a Bot|tle in my Trunk when I was trepann'd aboard, which if you had had the good Fortune to have taken, would have &s;av'd you Time, and Money.</P>
<P>When I had brought my old Gentleman a Bottle of my Stuff, he &s;eem'd even then to have little Faith in it; but I bad him have Patience till the Tryal. All he had to do was to convey about forty Drops in a Gla&s;s of White-Wine fa&s;ting. That, &s;aid he to me, will be a difficult thing, for I know &s;he hates me, neither will &s;he &s;tay in the Company where I am. However I told him I would do my Endeavour to find an Oppor|tunity: So I order'd him to keep a &s;mall Bottle in his Breeches Pocket, (for it mu&s;t be warm'd naturally with the Heat of the Per&s;on's Body that is to give it.) And in two or three Days I pre|vail'd upon a Relation of mine to invite the La|dy to drink Tea with her: I acquainted my old Lover that he &s;hould come in as by Accident, and bring a Pint of White-Wine as a Ta&s;te of a Parcel he was to di&s;po&s;e of. Every Thing happen'd as de&s;ired; the old Gentleman came in, and got an Opportunity of conveying &s;ome of the Drops into a Gla&s;s of Wine, and I had the Sati&s;|faction of &s;eeing her drink it. This pa&s;s'd off, and we parted: But the poor Woman in le&s;s than ten Days was di&s;tractedly in Love with the
<PB N="52" REF="61">
old Gentleman, who took his Opportunity, en|joy'd her, and after de&s;pis'd her.</P>
<P>Now the Nature of this Elixir is, that if the Do&s;e is not renew'd every time the Moon is in the full, the Object belov'd will &s;ink into dull Indifference again.</P>
<P>My Captain told me he thought I might have made my Fortune by &s;uch a Secret. I reply'd I had forgot to tell him that my Uncle made that one of his Articles, that I &s;hould never &s;ell a Drop of it, and I a&s;&s;ur'd him I would always keep my Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Our Story brought us to Town, and I was very much pleas'd, for I was both tir'd in in|venting Lies to amu&s;e him, and riding after the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> manner, with one's Knees almo&s;t to one's Mouth; and there's no altering the Stirrups.</P>
<P>We alighted at the Captain's Hou&s;e; he &s;ent about the Town, and in an Hour bought a com|pleat <HI>Still.</HI> He went with me to the Jew's that di&s;pos'd of Drugs, and by good Fortune, and a good Memory, I remembred the Names of a great many Sorts. I laid out &s;ome Money then, and told him I &s;hould want a great many other Sorts, and larger Quantities. Of this Jew I bor|row'd a Crucible (thro' the Captain's Intere&s;t) to melt the Gold, as I told him. The things were order'd immediately to the Country Hou&s;e, the Captain de&s;ir'd I would make no Delay, &s;o I re|turn'd, and got home ju&s;t by Sun-&s;et. I immedi|ately ran to my Green-hou&s;e to &s;ee if the Piece of Paper was there, but I found it was gone; this pleas'd me.</P>
<P>I went to Bed and ro&s;e early in the Morning, and &s;eem'd to be very bu&s;ie about the Garden. I &s;ent for my Eunuch out of the Hou&s;e, and told him what I had undertaken for the Captain; but I farther added, if he did not now and then
<PB N="53" REF="62">
give me his Company, attended with a Bottle of the Juice of the Grape, I could not po&s;&s;ibly go through with my Undertaking. He an&s;wer'd me, &s;miling, that he had Orders from his Ma|&s;ter not to di&s;obey me in any thing. But, ad|ded I, I have a harder Task than all this, for I am compell'd to have &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with the Woman I am to work upon, to find out her Temper; for according to her Di&s;po&s;ition I am to add or dimini&s;h &s;everal of my Ingredi|ents. Nothing could have prevail'd upon me, continu'd I, to have undertaken this hateful Task, but the Hopes I have of Liberty; for that is the Agreement between the Captain and me, if I &s;ucceed in my De&s;ign, which I am in no doubt of. I &s;hould be glad, return'd the Eu|nuch, you might meet with what you de&s;ire, yet I &s;hould be &s;orry to lo&s;e your good Compa|ny. I &s;hall with &s;ome Regret, an&s;wer'd I, part with you; but De&s;ire of Liberty, and indeed of revenging my &s;elf on my unkind Uncle, which is natural to us Mortals, will make me as expe|ditious as I can in my Work. I order'd him to let me have a Couple of Servants, to go with me into the Fields that Night, to carry the Herbs I &s;hould gather; and he told me they &s;hould at|tend me.</P>
<P>I now began to think of acquainting the La|dy with &s;ome Part of my De&s;ign, and therefore wrote her a Note to this Effect.</P>

She came to the old Place in an Hour after &s;he had brought the la&s;t, with another Note (as &s;he told me afterwards,) but reading mine, &s;he did not leave it behind her.</P>
<P>After my Eunuch and I had din'd, I went in|to the neighbouring Wood with two of the Captain's Slaves that were Blacks: I loaded them with Herbs of &s;everal Sorts, any thing I could lay my Hands on, and order'd them to carry 'em into the Garden. I had taken Care to tie every particular Herb with a String, &s;o that there was no Danger of mixing: The&s;e I hung in Bundles upon the Branches of &s;everal Trees in the Garden, and out we went again. In &s;hort, I gather'd a good Hor&s;e-load of different Sorts, and &s;ome I laid upon the Banks, and others I cover'd with Earth, that it look'd as if I was a|bout Bu&s;ine&s;s. I could hardly forbear &s;miling &s;ometimes when alone, notwith&s;tanding my An|xiety for the Succe&s;s of my De&s;ign, to think how &s;oon I drew in the credulous Captain. Then I began to be in a thou&s;and Fears of his di&s;co|vering my Intention to &s;ome of the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Phy|&s;icians, for tho' generally ignorant, yet they would &s;oon have found I was but an Impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>While I was amid&s;t my Fears the Captain arriv'd, who&s;e &s;ight gave me &s;ome Trouble. He came up to me, looking about him at what I had done; Why this looks like Work, &s;aid he. Yes Sir, &s;aid I, I am willing to begin, that I may make an End the &s;ooner: But Sir, I mu&s;t intreat one Favour, that you would not impart the Secret to any one of your Family but <HI>Mirza,</HI> nor to no one el&s;e upon any Account what&s;oe|ver: If they &s;eem inqui&s;itive, tell 'em I am on|ly di&s;tilling &s;ome &s;imple Waters for your Clo|&s;et. I like your Advice, an&s;wer'd the Captain, and will be &s;ure to follow it: The Rea&s;on of my

coming down now was to take my Leave of you, for I de&s;ign to &s;et Sail to-morrow Morn|ing early, for I am inform'd of a rich Ve&s;&s;el that will be in our Latitude in ten Days, from a Pri&s;oner that's lately taken belonging to <HI>Spain:</HI> I can't tell how long I &s;hall be out, but I hope by that time I come back, I &s;hall find every thing in readine&s;s. Sir, I return'd, I don't fear but to accompli&s;h my De&s;ign before you come back. Well, &s;aid he, do you think you &s;hall want any Thing el&s;e? I told him, nothing but now and then a Gallon of Sea Water. Well, &s;aid he, I &s;hall leave <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> behind me in Town, who &s;hall obey you in whatever you &s;hall command. Well, &s;aid he, Farewell (and &s;hook me by the Hand) I'll ju&s;t go in and give 'em a fre&s;h Charge concerning you, and then to Town again. I was very glad to hear him &s;ay &s;o; and he was as good as his Word, for in half an hour he took Hor&s;e: He &s;hook his Hand at me as he went by me, and I heartily wi&s;h'd it might be the la&s;t Time we might &s;ee one another; not as I could complain of my Treatment, for he had us'd me very hand&s;omely; and if it had not been in regard to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of my Love, I &s;hould not have wi&s;h'd him ill.</P>
<P><HI>Mirza</HI> came to me, and told me his Ma&s;ter had given 'em &s;o &s;trict a Charge to ob&s;erve my Directions, that if I had a mind to di&s;po&s;e of his E&s;tate, 'twas his own Fault, for we mu&s;t not di&s;obey you. Yes, an&s;wer'd I, if ever you find me requiring any thing foreign to this Af|fair, I'll give you leave to deny me; but there's one thing I mu&s;t command you &s;ince I have the Power, and that is to come and &s;up with me, and bring &s;ome of the Nectar along with you, for I am really fatigu'd with &s;tooping and walk|ing in the Sun when I gather'd tho&s;e Herbs.
<PB N="57" REF="66">
Well, return'd <HI>Mirza,</HI> I believe I &s;hall not find much Difficulty in obeying your Commands; and I have one Favour to beg of you, which is, that you will lay your Injunctions on <HI>Achmat,</HI> that he may partake. Said I, not to-day <HI>Mirza,</HI> another time with all my Heart. Nay, reply'd <HI>Mirza,</HI> it is not out of Love to <HI>Achmat</HI> that I de&s;ire it, but that he may be as deep in Sin as my &s;elf; for if he &s;hould ever di&s;cover me, I can't tell the Con&s;equence. Well, re|turn'd I, we'll find an Opportunity. The Hour of Supper being come, <HI>Mirza</HI> arriv'd with a couple of Flasks. We eat and drank &s;o heartily, that <HI>Mirza</HI> was incapable of helping him&s;elf; but was &s;o inebriated with Wine, that I began to repent of my plying him &s;o fa&s;t. I was forc'd to drag him, and lay him on my Bed. But how to conceal it from <HI>Achmat</HI> was my greate&s;t Care; for I did not doubt but he would be wanted; and accordingly it &s;o fell out. For about twelve a-clock at Night he came, and knock'd at my Door. I was up, and thinking of my De&s;ign. I open'd the Door, and un|der&s;tood by his Signs, that he wanted <HI>Mirza.</HI> I let him know by Signs, that I had &s;ent him to gather me &s;ome Herbs by Moon-light. He was &s;atisfy'd, and went back again. Now <HI>Mir|za</HI> kept the Key of the Gate, &s;o that my Story was feazable enough.</P>
<P>About four a-clock in the Morning <HI>Mirza</HI> wak'd, but frighted out of his Wits to find it Morning; tho' I &s;oon compos'd him, by letting him under&s;tand how I had manag'd <HI>Achmat.</HI> He return'd me a thou&s;and Thanks, and told me, he &s;hould never be able to make me amends. I ask'd him, how I &s;hou'd order it to &s;ee this Woman, for I could not go to Work till I had convers'd with her: And yet by Heaven and
<PB N="58" REF="67">
Paradi&s;e (&s;aid I) I &s;hall be more concern'd at the Interview, than at any thing which ever happen'd to me; (and that was but Truth, for my Mind was perplex'd between Hope and Fear, Joy and Anxiety.) I pity you indeed, &s;aid <HI>Mir|za,</HI> and I wi&s;h I cou'd any way ea&s;e you of the Trouble. Well, &s;aid I, then let her come alone into the Garden, as I am &s;prinkling my Herbs by and by; for I think one Woman is enough to plague a Man. Oh (&s;aid <HI>Mirza)</HI> all Men are not of your Mind. But I'll leave you, and hope to find you in better Humour, when I &s;ee you again.</P>
<P>I had order'd a Slave to bring me &s;ome Wa|ter, and a large Quantity of Salt, to mix with it, only to amu&s;e 'em. With this I &s;prinkled the Herbs I had gather'd, and I was very bu&s;y a|bout nothing.</P>
<P>I &s;aw pre&s;ently after the Idol of my Soul, and <HI>Mirza</HI> running before her. When he was near enough to me to be heard, he &s;aid, I mu&s;t beg you to excu&s;e my waiting on you for a little while; for my not being in the Hou&s;e la&s;t Night, as u&s;ual, has let my Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o encrea&s;e upon my Hands, that I mu&s;t make u&s;e of all Op|portunities to regain lo&s;t Time. I told him, I would not be his Hindrance, but was very &s;orry I could not have his Pre&s;ence upon this Occa&s;ion; for I &s;hould be in a very great Dilemma. He made me no An&s;wer (being the Lady was within hearing) but return'd into the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as the Coa&s;t was clear, I acco&s;ted her with a great deal of Timerity. Madam, &s;aid I, the happy Time is come, that I may tell you, without Fear or Danger, how much you may command me. Sir, (return'd &s;he) I am con|vinc'd of your &s;incere De&s;ire to &s;erve me; and as I have wrote to you, in one of my Notes, if

But if you plea&s;e, let us con&s;ult, now we have Time by the Forelock, how we &s;hall order our Affairs.

I have no Objection to it, an|&s;wer'd the Lady; but how will you procure it? Plea&s;e to leave that to me (I return'd) and in le&s;s than ten Days I hope we &s;hall be out of Danger. I then inform'd her of the Scheme I had laid, which &s;he mightily approv'd; and told me &s;he thought my Under&s;tanding outwent my Years. I told her &s;ome Accidents in Life new edg'd our Thoughts, and if we &s;ucceeded, the In&s;piration came from her. I ob&s;erv'd &s;he blu&s;h'd at my Di&s;cour&s;e, yet did not look as if &s;he took ll what I had &s;aid. But I was much concern'd to &s;ee her change the Di&s;cour&s;e. I did not think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t proper to declare my &s;elf any further, hoping when I had affected her Liberty, Gratitude would befriend me in her Heart.

She an&s;wered me, that &s;he would wait with &s;ome Impatience my Com|mands, and any Hour &s;hould find her in Readi|ne&s;s. She farther added, that &s;he wi&s;h'd &s;he might be as ready, and as willing, at her la&s;t Call. I begg'd her to ca&s;t off all melancholy Thoughts, and tru&s;t to Providence.

<P>When &s;he was gone, I &s;oon found the Sight of her encreas'd my Pa&s;&s;ion (if it was po&s;&s;ible for Love like mine to &s;uffer Augmentation.)

But even my Love &s;lumber'd now and then, that in|du&s;trious Diligence might wake, and I was re|&s;olv'd to put the De&s;ign in Execution with all the Expedition imaginable, for fear of Ac|cidents.

<P><HI>Mirza</HI> came to me &s;oon after. At his Approach&punc; I did my endeavour to put on a Countenance with little &s;atis&s;action of Mind, but I am apt to believe I did it but aukwardly. For as the Face is the
<PB N="61" REF="70">
Index of the Mind, I am of Opinion, a Per&s;on of nice Judgment and Ob&s;ervation may di&s;co|ver a fal&s;e Pa&s;&s;ion, with as much ea&s;e, as a Jew|eller would di&s;tingui&s;h the different Species of Stones (if we may call them &s;o.) Well, &s;aid <HI>Mir|za,</HI> your fiery Tryal is over; but I perceive by your Countenance, your Chagrine would wil|lingly wear off, if you'd but &s;uffer it. Why truly, &s;aid I, I have two different Pa&s;&s;ions &s;trug|ling in my Mind, that is, Joy and Grief. I am pleas'd to think I &s;hall &s;ucceed in the Affair I have undertaken; and yet griev'd that I mu&s;t be compell'd to &s;uffer the Torment I endure to help the Operation. Con&s;ider the Reward (re|ply'd <HI>Mirza)</HI> that is to follow. I chang'd the Di&s;cour&s;e, that I might not be put to the Trou|ble to &s;peak again&s;t my Con&s;cience any longer. I told him I &s;hould be obliged to go to Town for Salt-water out of the Sea, and other Nece&s;|&s;aries, that I &s;hould &s;tay for. Why, reply'd <HI>Mirza,</HI> you may &s;end for Salt-water, without being at the Trouble of going your &s;elf. I told him I was obliged to go in Per&s;on, becau&s;e I was to take it out of the Sea, when the Sun was in a particular Altitude. Nay, return'd <HI>Mirza,</HI> I am only concern'd upon my own Account, for I have engag'd <HI>Achmat</HI> to dine with you to-day, with a great deal of Trouble. Well, return'd I, I will not di&s;appoint you. I'll &s;tay one Day longer to oblige you. He return'd me many Thanks for my Conde&s;cen&s;ion, and went into the Hou&s;e to prepare Things accordingly.</P>
<P>All the while he was ab&s;ent, I was contriving my Scheme. When Dinner was ready, <HI>Mirza</HI> brought it in, accompany'd with <HI>Achmat.</HI> He had taken Care at &s;everal Times to bring Wine, and had plac'd it in a Vault in the Green-hou&s;e. <HI>Achmat</HI> made his <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Honours, and we all
<PB N="62" REF="71">
&s;at down. <HI>Mirza</HI> beg'd I would call the Wine a Cordial, that the Captain had given me. But I might have call'd it what Name I would, for <HI>Achmat</HI> did not under&s;tand me; for <HI>Mirza</HI> was my Interpreter, and with much Per&s;ua&s;ion we prevail'd upon him to ta&s;te it. But when he had drank one Gla&s;s, he &s;eem'd to like it mightily, and &s;oon ask'd for another; and in &s;hort, ply'd his Hand to his Head &s;o often, that he was ob|lig'd to get up, and play'd &s;uch Pranks, danc'd and &s;ung, and roll'd about, that it put us in a Fright, for fear &s;ome one &s;hould hear the Noi&s;e he made. Which to remedy, I made him drink more, till at la&s;t he dropt down, and fell a&s;leep. We laid him upon my Bed, and did not intend to di&s;turb him.</P>
<P>I told <HI>Mirza,</HI> now we had accompli&s;h'd this great Affair, I had a mind to go to Town even then, for the Sun &s;hone, and perhaps it might not the next Day, and I was willing to take the fir&s;t favourable Opportunity. He told me, what I pleas'd now the Jobb was done. Accor|dingly Hor&s;es and Slaves were provided me, and away I went for <HI>Sallee.</HI> When I came to Town I found <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> at home, who congratulated me with the Favour I had receiv'd from his Ma&s;ter, and farther added, that he had given him full Charge to obey me in whatever I &s;hould com|mand. I told him I &s;hould want his A&s;&s;i&s;tance immediately with a &s;mall Boat, only he and I, and I begg'd him to take his Quadrant with him, for I &s;hould want his Art a little. We took the Boat he had provided me, and row'd out of the Bay till we came to a &s;mall Promontory, where I de&s;ir'd him to take the Elevation of the Pole. When he had &s;o done, we lav'd Water into a Ve&s;&s;el we brought for that purpo&s;e, and went home again. From thence I went to the
<PB N="63" REF="72">
Jew's, and begg'd he would furni&s;h me with a <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Habit for my pre&s;ent Wear; for the Peo|ple of the Country do &s;o &s;tare at me, &s;aid I, being in a different Dre&s;s from them, that it makes me a&s;ham'd. He provided me with a very hand&s;ome one, which I had pack'd up careful|ly, that no one &s;hould ob&s;erve what it was. I bought &s;everal Trifles of him that I had no oc|ca&s;ion for, and at &s;everal Times other rich Ha|bits; but one thing particularly that I hop'd I &s;hould want, which was a Pint of liquid <HI>Lau|danum.</HI></P>
<P>I went to <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> and order'd my things to be got ready: While that was doing, I endea|vour'd to &s;ound him to know whether he had any Thoughts about his Liberty, for I remem|bred at our fir&s;t Meeting he declar'd him&s;elf, as I thought, very frankly: But in all his Di&s;cour&s;e now, I found him of a wavering uncertain Tem|per, and therefore I thought it the wi&s;e&s;t way to keep my De&s;ign to my &s;elf, and go another way to work. I took my leave of him, and went home. I unloaded my Hor&s;es, and took particular Care of my Bundle of Things. My Salt Water I put into &s;hallow Pans in the Sun, which in a Day's time produc'd &s;mall Quanti|ties of Salt. I did not want to try Experiments, yet I was pleas'd to &s;ee the Operations.</P>
<P>I began to &s;et my <HI>Still</HI> on Work the next Day, but was &s;oon interrupted in my Progre&s;s by the ha&s;ty Arrival of <HI>Mirza.</HI> Said he, we have brought a fine Hou&s;e upon our Heads; yonder's <HI>Achmat</HI> won't be contented without more of the <HI>Francks</HI> Cordial [the <HI>Moors</HI> call all <HI>Europeans Francks.]</HI> I ask'd him how he order'd him when he wak'd, after I had left 'em; he told me, he was &s;o greedy after the precious Liquor, that he drain'd the empty Bottles; and he believ'd if
<PB N="64" REF="73">
<HI>Mahomet</HI> him&s;elf had made him a Vi&s;it, and <HI>Ach|mat</HI> had got a Bottle to his No&s;e, he would not have bid him welcome till he had &s;een the Bot|tom. Well, &s;aid I, you know the Liquor is not mine, but I'll &s;tand by you in the Con&s;umption of it. Well, if you plea&s;e then, &s;aid <HI>Mirza,</HI> we'll trouble you with our Company to-night. With all my Heart, &s;aid I; &s;o we agreed to &s;up together. <HI>Mirza</HI> farther added, that the Ladies had a mind to &s;ee my <HI>Still</HI> at work. I told him they might do as they thought fit, but I would get out of the Way; and accordingly he went to fetch them. The <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Women came down the Walk in a ha&s;ty manner to ob&s;erve it, but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lady came alone as u&s;ual. I had got on the other Side of the Lawrel Trees, and took Care to appear in her Sight. A&s;&s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me, &s;he cautiou&s;ly approach'd me, and told me &s;oftly &s;he wanted to have a little Talk with me. I an&s;wer'd her, we had an Opportunity ve|ry favourable; and then let her know how the other Women were employ'd, (be&s;ide we had the Lawrel Walk between us, and I was out of Sight from every Body el&s;e.) She told me &s;he had &s;omething particular to mention to me; &s;aid &s;he, we &s;hall certainly want Money to accommodate us with many Nece&s;&s;aries in our dangerous Voy|age. I told her what Money I had &s;av'd for our De&s;ign, but that we &s;hould certainly have Occa&s;ion for more, if we were oblig'd to go for <HI>Spain.</HI> That was one of the Rea&s;ons, &s;aid &s;he, why I wanted to confer with you: It is in my Power to procure a con&s;iderable Sum, and tho' it is not &s;o much as I have lo&s;t by the Captain, yet I have even a Scruple to take clande&s;tine|ly from him what I may &s;ay is my own ju&s;tly. I &s;oon remov'd her Scruples, and then &s;he far|ther told me, what was in her Power to take
<PB N="65" REF="74">
was chiefly in Jewels, which would be better for Concealment and Carriage than Money. By this time &s;he ob&s;erv'd the other Ladies coming towards her, which &s;he inform'd me of; upon that I took my leave, and ab&s;conded. When they were gone off the Walks, <HI>Mirza</HI> came to me to relea&s;e me, as he call'd it, and told me the Ladies were mighty well pleas'd with the View of my Work and Materials. I told him, I hop'd they would not give me that Trouble often: He an&s;wer'd, he would take Care for the future.</P>
<P>Now the Cri&s;is of my Project was very near. I went to Town the next Day, and took <HI>Mu|&s;tapha</HI> for more Water; and farther added, I &s;hould want him a Night or two hence to pro|cure Water by Moon-light. He wonder'd at my Proceeding, but his Ma&s;ter had told him that I was &s;omething very extraordinary, and &s;u&s;|pected me of Magick; but he al&s;o inform'd him that I was u&s;ing my Art for his Benefit. I told him I had &s;everal Materials to wa&s;h in the Sea Water in the Full of the Moon (which was at that time) and then I &s;hould give him no farther Trouble. From thence I went to my Jew's a|gain, and privately procur'd &s;everal &s;orts of dry'd Provi&s;ions, as Neats Tongues, Biskets, dry'd Fi&s;h, Wine, and a &s;mall Puncheon of Water, and &s;e|veral other Nece&s;&s;aries, all to be ready at a Mo|ment's Warning.</P>
<P>When I had provided every thing, I went home again, and got an Opportunity the &s;ame Day to &s;peak with my Mi&s;tre&s;s. I de&s;ir'd &s;he would be ready about twelve a-clock at Night, with every thing &s;he had a mind to take with her. She told me &s;he could not tell how to e|&s;cape the Vigilance of the Eunuchs, for, &s;aid &s;he, they lock me up every Night when they
<PB N="66" REF="75">
go to Bed; nay, every Day, when they are not with me. I de&s;ir'd her to leave that to me. I invited <HI>Mirza</HI> and <HI>Achmat</HI> to &s;up with me that Night, for I told 'em I was oblig'd to &s;it up to watch my Work, being it was coming to a Head, and that I was to go to Town before Day. They comply'd with my Reque&s;t with a great deal of Joy; and the Hour drawing near, they lock'd up the Doors of the Hou&s;e, and came with a great deal of Contentment in their Looks. We &s;at down, and I ply'd them with Wine till they thought they had enough. For the fini&s;hing Stroke I de&s;ir'd 'em to drink one Cup of a Li|quor of my own di&s;tilling, which they &s;oon com|ply'd with. I went and fetch'd a Bottle of Bran|dy that I had procur'd on purpo&s;e, in which I had convey'd a large Quantity of <HI>Laudanum,</HI> to be ready for this Occa&s;ion. I gave 'em each a good large Cup, which they &s;wallow'd, but did not very well like the Ta&s;te. I told them I had di&s;till'd that Liquor on purpo&s;e to keep the Fumes of the Wine (or <HI>Cordial,</HI> as <HI>Achmat</HI> would have it) out of the Head. They were very well pleas'd if it would have that Effect, yet de&s;ir'd another Gla&s;s of Wine to put the Ta&s;te out of their Mouths, which I comply'd with. The Liquor &s;oon had its de&s;ir'd Effect, and a profound Sleep lock'd up all their Sen&s;es. I with &s;ome Fear took the Keys out of <HI>Achmat</HI>'s Pocket, and went directly to the Hou&s;e, and at la&s;t found the right Key that open'd the Place where my Trea&s;ure was repos'd. Tho' &s;he found her &s;elf at Liberty, yet &s;he &s;hook with timerous Appre|hen&s;ions. I encourag'd her all I could, and brought her the Di&s;gui&s;e which I had provided for her. While &s;he was getting ready, I retir'd out of Decency, and got out my Hor&s;es, and an <HI>Italian</HI> Slave, whom I had two or three times
<PB N="67" REF="76">
taken to Town with me: He under&s;tood a lit|tle <HI>French,</HI> and I had ob&s;erv'd &s;omething in his Countenance that &s;poke him worthy of a bet|ter Fate. I had not once mention'd to him any thing of my Project, for fear of any Accident, but I had order'd him to be ready to go with me that Night. When I came back, I found my Mi&s;tre&s;s ready, and &s;omething impatient. I inform'd her &s;he mu&s;t &s;ubmit to another Di&s;gui&s;e. She ask'd me what that was: I took out a Pa|per of <HI>Ombre,</HI> and told her &s;he mu&s;t permit me to rub it over her Face and Hands; which I did: But the Plea&s;ure of touching her Fle&s;h in that gentle manner perfectly put me in an Ec&s;ta&s;y, which &s;he ob&s;erv'd, for I could not help &s;oftly &s;queezing her Hand. She did not &s;eem di&s;pleas'd at my Tran&s;port, but yet I thought the Occa&s;ion &s;he had to make U&s;e of me made her bear with me. A&s;&s;oon as we were ready we went out, but I fir&s;t lock'd the Doors and left 'em as I found 'em. My Mind was con|fus'd between Hope, Fear, Joy, and Terror, and I did not doubt but the Lady was in a wor&s;e Condition; but all my Task was to com|fort her. When I had help'd her up on Hor&s;e|back, I call'd for the <HI>Italian</HI> Slave, and we both mounted, for I would not let him walk on Foot as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>When we were got &s;afe from the Hou&s;e, I began to ask the <HI>Italian</HI> Slave &s;everal Que&s;tions, as where he was born, how long he had been a Slave, and &s;o forth. I found by his An&s;wers that he had no Hopes of Liberty, for he had &s;ent &s;everal Letters to his Friends in <HI>Italy,</HI> and never could receive any An&s;wer. Then I began to come nearer the matter, and gave him &s;ome Hint of our De&s;ign, but with this Addition, e|ven Death &s;hould not deter me from the Execution.
<PB N="68" REF="77">
He had hardly Patience to hear me out, but begg'd he might &s;hare the &s;ame Fate with me, and if he got his Liberty through my Means, he &s;hould never forget the Obligation, but I might be Ma&s;ter of that Life I &s;hould be the Means of &s;aving; for, added he, to live in Sla|very is but to be always dying the wor&s;t of Deaths. I &s;oon found by his manner of expre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf that he was &s;incere in what he &s;aid. At la&s;t I told him all my De&s;ign; which he mighti|ly approv'd of, and &s;aid every thing was &s;o well concerted, that with the Ble&s;&s;ing of God it could not mi&s;carry.</P>
<P>When we arriv'd at the Captain's Town Hou&s;e, we found <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> waiting for me. I had con|&s;ider'd we could not do without him, yet I would not venture to mention our E&s;cape, till we had him &s;afe upon the Sea. I order'd eve|ry thing into the Boat, and to hide my di&s;guis'd Lady, I told <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> that it was a young Gen|tleman that had been bit by a mad Dog, and I had brought him to dip him in the Sea, by the De&s;ire of his Friends that liv'd in the Neigh|bourhood in the Country, which was allow'd to be the only Cure.</P>
<P>When we had gain'd the main Sea, I began to open my De&s;ign to <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> but was &s;ome|thing &s;urpriz'd to hear him call out for Help. I immediately drew a Pi&s;tol out of my Pocket (for I had procur'd &s;everal Pair) held it to his Brea&s;t, and threaten'd him with Death that Moment, if he offer'd to open his Mouth: I ad|ded, that we had gone too far to &s;top now; and I believe, if he had made any Re&s;i&s;tance, I &s;hould certainly have di&s;patch'd him. When he found Re&s;i&s;tance would &s;ignify nothing, he &s;at him down and wept bitterly. I was really &s;or|ry to &s;ee him &s;o much afflicted, and comforted
<PB N="69" REF="78">
him all I could; and, to encourage him, I told him, a&s;&s;oon as we arriv'd at <HI>Magazan,</HI> (a &s;trong Port belonging to the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> upon the <HI>Afric</HI> Coa&s;t) where I had de&s;ign'd to &s;teer our Cour&s;e, he &s;hould not only have his Liberty, but I would reward him with fifty Pi&s;toles for the Pains he &s;hould be at. I further added, I would not have given him this Trouble, if I could have found a po&s;&s;ibility of doing without him. He &s;eem'd to be &s;atisfied, and promis'd us all the Help he could. I told him we would make the be&s;t of our way to <HI>Magazan,</HI> not being above twenty Leagues South of <HI>Sallee:</HI> He &s;eem'd very much pleas'd our Voyage was to be &s;o &s;hort, for the Wind was fair, and we hop'd to arrive at <HI>Magazan</HI> in two Days at the farthe&s;t. I had provided eve|ry thing that was nece&s;&s;ary for a much longer Voyage, and when we had directed our Cour&s;e, and were &s;ettled in our Way, I de&s;ir'd the La|dy to take &s;ome Refre&s;hment, and compo&s;e her un&s;ettled Thoughts&punc; for we were now out of all manner of Danger. I &s;aid this only to comfort her, for I was even in fear of the Captain's Ship, or &s;ome other <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, meeting us by Chance; and the <HI>Italian</HI> put into my Head ano|ther Fear, that as I had declar'd I was never at <HI>Ma|gazan,</HI> nor did not know where it was &s;ituated, he was not a&s;&s;ur'd but <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> might &s;teer his Cour&s;e to &s;ome Place that was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Moors.</HI> I gave <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> a Hint of it, with a Promi&s;e of a quick Di&s;patch if he betray'd us: But he a&s;&s;ur'd me there was never another Port between that and <HI>Magazan.</HI> After we had refre&s;h'd our &s;elves, I intreated the Lady to acquaint us how &s;he came into the Power of the Captain. Now we are &s;omething at Ea&s;e, &s;aid &s;he obligingly, I &s;hall inform you with Plea&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF Mrs. <HI>VILLARS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_MY Father's Name was <HI>Villars,</HI> an eminent Merchant of the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> My Mother dy'd when I was very young, &s;o that I could never know the Lo&s;s of her. The Care of my Father atton'd for the Want of my Mother: He gave me all the Education that was proper to our Sex; but before I was Sixteen my Father dy'd. The Grief and Sorrow I felt for his Death, was not recompens'd by an E&s;tate of two thou|&s;and Pounds a Year, which he left intirely at my own Di&s;po&s;al; be&s;ides &s;everal valuable Jewels of my Mother's. My Fortune, I &s;uppo&s;e, brought me many Admirers; but as I was a Stranger to Love, I had no Inclination to marry: Yet be|ing pe&s;ter'd &s;o much with their Company and Court&s;hip, I retir'd to a Country Hou&s;e near the Sea Side; and as I did not care to &s;ee any of my Suitors, &s;o whenever they came I always left Word I was gone abroad, or out of Order; and in a little time I got clear of their Imperti|nence.</P>
<P>I had the Misfortune to be a Woman of Bu|&s;ine&s;s, tho' young; for my Father had &s;everal
<PB N="71" REF="80">
Ve&s;&s;els at Sea. The Captain of one of the Ships that traded to <HI>Turky</HI> brought me a Bill of La|ding, and I happen'd to plea&s;e him, (tho' more than I knew till afterwards.) In &s;hort, he fell de&s;perately in Love with me, but hearing my Aver&s;ion to Matrimony, never declar'd his Pa&s;|&s;ion to me; yet by Bribes and Pre&s;ents gain'd over to his Intere&s;t a Maid that liv'd with me, who for a hundred Pound had plac'd him in a Clo&s;et in my Bed-chamber. I came and undre&s;s'd my &s;elf as U&s;ual, and went to Re&s;t: But I had not been long laid ere I found a Per&s;on pul|ling down the Cloaths, and attempting to come to Bed to me. I was prodigiou&s;ly &s;urpriz'd and frighten'd, as any one would imagine: I call'd for Help, but no one came to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance; for the Maid had taken Care of that. I got out of Bed with much ado, and attempted to open the Door, but found I was lock'd in. I us'd Intreaties to the Wretch (who was di&s;guis'd in &s;uch a manner that I could not know him, for he had got a Mask on) but all to no pur|po&s;e: He &s;eiz'd me, and I was &s;o faint with Struggling, that he was very near accompli&s;hing his barbarous De&s;ign, when my other Clo&s;et Door flew open, (for I had one at each End of the Room) and there came out another Man di&s;guis'd. My Fear could not be well in|creas'd; but I was in &s;uch a Terror that I did not well know whether I was really alive.</P>
<P>The Per&s;on who came out la&s;t &s;eiz'd imme|diately on the other, who let me go to defend him&s;elf. I ran to the Door, and Fear adding to my Strength, I bur&s;t it open; but how, or which way, I cannot remember. I ran to the Maid's Chamber, and the Noi&s;e and Confu&s;ion we were in alarm'd the Men Servants. I had &s;lipt on a Gown; and when I had got all the Men toge|ther,
<PB N="72" REF="81">
I told 'em the Rea&s;on of this Alarm. They immediately arm'd them&s;elves, and ran up to my Chamber, but the Per&s;ons were both gone. In &s;earching the Room we found a Piece of a Mask on the Ground, and a Handkerchief mark'd <HI>L. K.</HI> with Stains of Blood in &s;everal Parts of the Room. We could not imagine who they were; and I was &s;o very much confus'd and frighten'd, that I did not examine the Bottom of it that Night, but went to Bed in another Room very ill with the Fright; though not before I had given Order to two of my Men Servants to watch at my Chamber Door.</P>
<P>I &s;earch'd the Clo&s;ets of that other Room, and under the Bed, before I wou'd venture. And it being a Room where my Father us'd to lye, it had a Bar on the In&s;ide, &s;o I and my Maid went to Bed. Notwith&s;tanding my Fa|tigue, Frights and Fears, I fell a&s;leep, and when I woke in the Morning, found my &s;elf very well. I began then to think rea&s;onably of my la&s;t Night's Adventure, and ea&s;ily judg'd, that one or both of my Maids mu&s;t be in the Confederacy, for my Door never us'd to be lock'd on the Out&s;ide before. I &s;ent for all my Ser|vants up, Men and Maids, and related to 'em the Night's Adventure. But they brought me Word, that Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an</HI> was not to be found. I &s;ent to examine her Room, but I was inform'd all her things were gone. We all concluded, that &s;he was the Occa&s;ion of the la&s;t Night's Plot. I did not think fit to &s;end after her, rejoycing I had e&s;cap'd &s;uch a ba&s;e Con&s;piracy; till going up into my own Chamber, I found a Diamond Necklace, a Ring, my Gold Watch, and about &s;ixty Guineas in Money taken away; my E&s;critore broke o|pen, and a Bill of five hundred Pounds that
<PB N="73" REF="82">
was due, taken away. I immediately &s;ent to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> to &s;top Payment, but was told, that my Maid had come, as from me, for the Money, and had receiv'd it &s;everal Hours before. We made the &s;tricte&s;t Search we could for her, but all to no Purpo&s;e. So I gave it all for lo&s;t. Six Weeks pa&s;s'd on, and no News concerning my Maid. One Morning as I was walking in my Garden, a Sailor brought me a Letter, which was to this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Heartily repent of my Infidelity to you. When I committed that ba&s;e Action, I took Shelter on Board of a Ship that belongs to my Brother, and now lies about &s;ix Miles off; where the Bearer will conduct your Lady&s;hip, if you will be &s;o good to come away immediately. The Rea&s;on of my Repentance, and Sorrow (tho' a &s;incere one) is at the Approach of Death, by the Accident of a Fall down the Hold of the Ship, where I broke my left Leg, and fractur'd my Scull, &s;o that I have been &s;en&s;ele&s;s for two Days. But God granting me my Sen&s;es again (tho' with the Information that I can't live four and twenty Hours) has, through his Mercy, convino'd me, that to ex|pect Pardon from him, is to re&s;tore what is yours, with a &s;incere Confe&s;&s;ion of the fatal Night's Ad|venture, that corrupted my Hone&s;ty, and will be the Cau&s;e of my Death. And farther, if Heaven will grant me the Ble&s;&s;ing of &s;eeing you, I may put you in a Way to prevent &s;omething of Ill that may hap|pen to you.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Now I had heard of one of the <HI>Turky</HI> Fleet, that was obliged to put into the Road by a violent Storm: And that it had a Sedan, made with Looking-gla&s;s, of a very curious Work|man&s;hip, de&s;ign'd for a Pre&s;ent to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperor. I ask'd the Sailor &s;everal Que&s;tions concerning the Letter, and he an&s;wer'd me bluntly, he could not tell any thing about it; but that there was a young Woman, who had fell down their Hold, and had almo&s;t kill'd her &s;elf; and that they did not expect &s;he could ever recover. I re&s;olv'd to go along with him, but to take two Men Servants and a Maid with me. I walk'd to the Water-&s;ide, which was about a quarter of a Mile from my Hou&s;e, and there I found a Ship's Boat with eight Oars, and very hand&s;ome. I &s;tept into it, with my Servants, without any He&s;itation, and put off. In about an Hour and a half we came along &s;ide of the Ve&s;&s;el, they mann'd Side for me, and I was handed up, and led into the Cabin, where I found my Maid upon a Pallat-Bed in one Corner of it. A&s;&s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me, &s;he attempted to ri&s;e, but &s;eem'd not to have Strength enough, and fell down again. I de|&s;ir'd &s;he would not put her &s;elf to any Pain, but compo&s;e her Thoughts, that &s;he might be the bet|ter able to inform me of what &s;he had promis'd me in her Letter. O! Madam, &s;he cry'd (with He&s;itations, Sighs, and ready to faint every Mo|ment) you do not know what I feel at the Sight of you. You bring into my Remem|brance the Tran&s;action of that fearful Night, but I hope your Goodne&s;s will forgive me. I &s;hall put into your Hands what I have wickedly
<PB N="75" REF="84">
robb'd you of; and &s;ince I am going out of this World, I am a&s;&s;ur'd your Good-nature will prevail for my Pardon. I told her I forgave her freely, and I hop'd Heav'n would do &s;o too. She thank'd me, but &s;aid, &s;he found her &s;elf &s;o Ill, that &s;he intreated leave to re&s;t from &s;peaking a Minute or two, to gather a little Breath.</P>
<P>I waited with &s;ome Impatience, but &s;he re|main'd &s;o long &s;ilent, that I really thought &s;he was expir'd. Upon that Suppo&s;ition, I call'd to her, and &s;he an&s;wer'd me but faintly. Well, Madam &s;aid &s;he, as I find you impatient to know what I have promis'd you, I will tell you, as well as I am able.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Bourn</HI> had for many Months a great Pa&s;&s;ion for you, but finding you aver&s;e to Matri|mony, he tamper'd with me, and offer'd me &s;uch large Sums of Money, that beat down all my guard of Hone&s;ty, and overcame it quite. He gave me a hundred Pounds, be&s;ides other va|luable Pre&s;ents, to admit him into your Clo&s;et, before you went to-bed, which accordingly (dazled with the lu&s;tre of the Gold) I did. You know what follow'd, and if he had not been pre|vented by the &s;udden Appearance of another Per&s;on out of the other Clo&s;et, would have compa&s;s'd his De&s;ign. Said I (eagerly) pray do you know who the other Per&s;on was? Yes Ma|dam, return'd the Wench, it was Mr. <HI>Lawrence Kendrick,</HI> your former Suitor and Guardian, con|vey'd there for the &s;ame ba&s;e Intent by your Lady|&s;hip's Woman. How! cry'd I amaz'd, are you a&s;&s;ur'd of that? Madam (pur&s;u'd &s;he) when you got out of the Door, Mr. <HI>Kendrick</HI> &s;eiz'd upon Mr. <HI>Bourn,</HI> and they &s;truggled together &s;ome time; but Mr. <HI>Kend|rik</HI>'s Mask falling off, Captain <HI>Bourn</HI> knowing him, cry'd, Is it you! In &s;hort, they &s;oon came to an Ecclairci&s;ement, and went down Stairs unperceiv'd
<PB N="76" REF="85">
by any of us in the Hurry. Where he declar'd to the Captain, that he had prevail'd upon Mrs. <HI>Ellis</HI> (your Woman) for a good Sum of Money, to convey him into the Clo&s;et, which &s;he did unperceiv'd of any. Thus, (&s;aid I) may ill In|tentions be ever fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>When &s;he had fini&s;h'd, &s;he begg'd me to have a little more Patience, while &s;he got a little more Strength, and &s;he would re&s;tore me my Money and Jewels. I was unwilling to wait long, yet thought fifteen hundred Pounds too much to lo&s;e; for my Necklace, Ring, and Watch, were valued by my Father at a thou&s;and Pounds. I believe I had been full three Hours on Board, and wanted to be at Home again; and after &s;he had kept &s;ilent &s;ome time, I made bold to di|&s;turb her once more. I call'd to her, and told her, I had a great Way to go, and I was a|fraid of catching cold. She begg'd I would ring a Bell that hung by my Hand, which I did, and the Sailor came in that brought me the Letter. Pray, &s;aid the Maid, is my Brother ready to come in? Yes, an&s;wer'd he, and has been on Board this half Hour. It's very well, &s;aid &s;he. Upon that &s;he rais'd her Hand, and unpinn'd a Shutter, that fell down, and let Light enough into the Cabin, which was dark before; but I thought her Illne&s;s was the Rea&s;on of that. But to my eternal Amazement I &s;aw her ri&s;e from the Pallate, as well as ever I &s;aw her in my Life. Before I had Power to &s;peak, Cap|tain <HI>Bourn</HI> enter'd. I could not pre&s;ently dive in|to this My&s;tery. I hope Captain (&s;aid I, at la&s;t) that you repent of your ra&s;h and bold Attempt. Yes Madam, (an&s;wer'd he) that I did not &s;uc|ceed in't, but I hope I have it now in my Pow|er to fini&s;h my De&s;ign. I askt him what he meant. He told me I &s;hould &s;oon be inform'd,
<PB N="77" REF="86">
and if I would not con&s;ent to his Embraces, he would certainly ravi&s;h me that very Night. Up|on this Treatment, I began to call for my Ser|vants; but the faithle&s;s <HI>Su&s;an</HI> told me they were taken care of, and &s;afe a-&s;hore. Yes Madam, return'd the Captain, they are twelve Miles be|hind us by this Time; and de&s;ir'd I would look out of the Cabin Window, which they had ju&s;t before open'd. I ca&s;t my Eyes behind me; and too &s;oon perceiv'd that we were a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance from the Land. I did not look long, for the Sight took away my Sen&s;es, and I fell down in a Swoon, and when I came to my &s;elf it was far in Night; but I was &s;o faint and ill, that my feeble Limbs would not &s;upport my Body. Grief attack'd me &s;o violently, that it was thought by every body it would &s;oon over|come me. By next Morning a &s;trong Feaver &s;eiz'd me, and all that I remember'd for &s;ix Weeks was, that I was put to Bed, with the Wretch that betray'd me to attend me. But the Condi|tion I was in really wrought upon her, and produc'd a true Conver&s;ion. She lamented more than I; and curs'd her &s;elf a thou&s;and times.</P>
<P>When I had recover'd my Sen&s;es, I was wore away to a Skeleton. And &s;ure never any one in my Condition found any Relief but Death. But it pleas'd the Divine Being to work another Mi|racle, and in&s;en&s;ibly re&s;tore me to my former health of Body, but a Mind involv'd in the mo&s;t cruel Torture pa&s;t Imagination.</P>
<P>When I found the Maid's Repentance real, I freely forgave her. The Captain in all this Time had never come near me, but only to en|quire after my Health, as <HI>Su&s;an</HI> inform'd me. But when he perceiv'd I had regain'd my former Health and Beauty, (as he call'd it) I was tor|mented with his bea&s;tly Addre&s;&s;es. He told me,
<PB N="78" REF="87">
if I would con&s;ent to marry him, and for|give the Crime he was guilty of, he would im|mediately &s;teer for <HI>England,</HI> which he could reach in a few Days. I con&s;ider'd I was in a Wretch's Power, who, by what he had done al|ready, would &s;tick at nothing to gain his Ends; I therefore re&s;olv'd to flatter him, by the Advice of my Maid; who, notwith&s;tanding &s;he had brought me into the&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, I had taken into my former Favour. In one of his trouble&s;ome Vi&s;its, I told him, if he would immediately re&s;tore me to my Liberty, I would upon the In&s;tant make him my Husband, when we could procure a proper Per&s;on to tye the Knot. He an&s;wer'd me, that the only way to &s;ecure me to him, was to have Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Body before-hand; and, conti|nu'd he, if you think the Action criminal, I'll &s;oon cure your Con&s;cience, by the Licence of the Church. For, &s;aid he, if you intend what you propo&s;e, you will ea&s;ily comply; and nothing el&s;e will convince me of your Sincerity. I'll give you one Day to con&s;ider on't; but, (continu'd the Wretch) if you refu&s;e to &s;ubmit by fair Means, I to-morrow by Force will en|joy you. So I leave you to con&s;ider on't; and &s;aying this, left us in the Cabin. I had de&s;ir'd <HI>Su&s;an</HI> to conceal our Reconcilement from the Captain, which &s;he artfully had done; and in his Di&s;cour&s;e, would often throw in a Word or two in his behalf.</P>
<P>When we were alone, I gave my &s;elf over to my Sorrows, and thought of nothing for &s;eve|ral Hours but my unhappy Circum&s;tances. We both continu'd &s;ilent, a con&s;iderable time. Nor indeed had I Power to &s;peak, tho' Heav'n had indu'd me with that Fortitude, that I had re&s;olv'd &s;ooner to die, than to &s;ubmit to his curs'd Propo&s;als. I told <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> that I had de|termin'd
<PB N="79" REF="88">
to put an end to all my Sorrows by Death; and when that fatal Hour arriv'd of his limitted Time, I would plung a Knife, I had con|ceal'd for that De&s;ign, into my Bo&s;om. This Re&s;olution once more renew'd our Griefs, and we mingled Tears together. We wept &s;o much, that the Fountains of our Eyes were dry, and we again remain'd &s;ilent. At la&s;t <HI>Su&s;an</HI> broke it, with a Speech to this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Madam, in the Confu&s;ion of my Thoughts, I have cho&s;e out one that has &s;ome Probability of Succe&s;s; but it will at lea&s;t convince you of my Repentance, and the De&s;ire I have to re&s;tore you that Peace I have barbarou&s;ly broke. The Captain yet thinks me in his Intere&s;t, and if we can contrive it, I'll &s;ubmit to his loath'd Embraces in your Room, which &s;hall be ma|nag'd in this Manner. (You &s;hall treat with him upon't to-morrow Morning) The Articles &s;hall be the&s;e; Fir&s;t, that he come in the Dark, and &s;tay no longer than one Hour with you; and la&s;t, that he &s;hall not repeat your Familiarity, till you are join'd by the Prie&s;t.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, this Propo&s;al gave me a dawn of Hope; and if we could but &s;ucceed in't, I &s;hould not fear his farther Pa&s;&s;ion, when we were landed. For I knew it was ea&s;y to find Protection, when once on Shore in <HI>England,</HI> and I thought the Contrivance feazible enough; for we were much of the &s;ame Age, and no per|ceiv'd Difference in our Make, at lea&s;t in the Dark.</P>
<P>She left it to me to manage: And I re&s;olv'd to put on a more compos'd Countenance at the Captain's next Vi&s;it, which was &s;oon after, tho' he had given me longer Time to con&s;ider. When he came in, he begg'd my Pardon for in|terrupting me, but he came to make me a Pre|&s;ent,
<PB N="80" REF="89">
he &s;aid, and put a little Box in my Hand, de&s;iring I would open it, which I did, where I found my Jewels and Money. I re&s;tore you that, Madam, (continu'd he) and would not wil|lingly be oblig'd to you for any thing but your Per&s;on; and even all your Fortune &s;hall be at your own Di&s;po&s;al, and the Moment you con|&s;ent to my De&s;ires, I'll deliver you a Paper that &s;hall oblige me to &s;ign whatever Terms you &s;hall think fit to make me. I paus'd a &s;hort time, but indeed it was to think what my Tongue &s;hould utter &s;o foreign to my Heart.</P>
<P>Captain, &s;aid I, you take the only Way to gain your Point; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, this Shew of Genero&s;ity (tho' it's in your Power to force 'em from me again) &s;eems a little to le&s;&s;en the ill Opinion I have Rea&s;on to bear again&s;t you: If you'll plea&s;e to allow me one half Hour to think a little, I'll give you my final An&s;wer to-night. He &s;eem'd very much overjoy'd at my Di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;hew'd it in an extravagant unpolite manner, thank'd me, and went out.</P>
<P>I did not want that time to prepare what I had to &s;ay, but I thought it was better than to come into it on a &s;udden. The time expir'd, the Captain came in with an expecting Face. I bad him &s;it down, which I found by his Coun|tenance he took as a good Prologue. Sir, &s;aid I, I have fully con&s;idered every thing, and if you will comply with a few Articles, you &s;hall have Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what you de&s;ire to-night. Articles; Madam! I'll &s;ign to a Blank (reply'd the Brute) if you plea&s;e. I told him they were only verbal ones: Fir&s;t, &s;aid I, I'll have no Light in the Room; &s;econdly, you &s;hall &s;tay with me but an Hour; and la&s;tly, never to expect any more Favours till we are lawfully marry'd. Madam, return'd the Captain, you &s;o overjoy me that I don't know
<PB N="81" REF="90">
where I am: I'll comply with all your Articles, and you have made me the happie&s;t of Mankind. He &s;aid a great deal more ful&s;ome Stuff, that was as nau&s;eous to my Ears as a Plague-&s;ore to the Sight. He left us, with a Hope I would not long defer his Happine&s;s. It was well I was in a dark Corner of the Cabin; for had I been in the Light, he would have perceiv'd the Confu&s;ion in my Countenance.</P>
<P>The hated Hour drew near, and <HI>Su&s;an</HI> with a &s;incere Grief, and Tears running down her Cheeks, laid her &s;elf in the Captain's loathed Bed. I was really griev'd at the Sacrifice &s;he was going to make me, for I was convinc'd &s;he had no loo&s;e De&s;ires about her. The Captain enter'd in the Dark, and was as happy as a fal&s;e Imagination could make him. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was in a thou&s;and Frights and Fears le&s;t the Girl &s;hould have been di&s;covered; but every thing &s;ucceeded too well, and the Captain ro&s;e within his limi|ted time, and went out.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as he was gone, the poor Creature got up from her guilty Scene. Well, Madam, (&s;aid &s;he, all drown'd in Tears,) I hope I have con|vinc'd you (tho' to my eternal Co&s;t) of my Re|pentance and Sincerity; but I hope Heaven will pardon me, and not lay the Crime to me or you, when fatal Nece&s;&s;ity was the only Cau&s;e. I gave her all the Comfort I was capable of, and told her I did not think it impo&s;&s;ible to oblige him to marry her, when we had him in our Power on Shore, and that Formality would obliterate all melancholy Thoughts. How! (reply'd <HI>Su&s;an)</HI> No Madam! tho' I have done all this, yet it was only to &s;erve you; and before I would be his Wife, (or indeed any Man's Wife) I would &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t &s;ervile Offices of Life to &s;upport it: And if the Captain knew how we
<PB N="82" REF="91">
had deceiv'd him, and would offer to marry me to attone for his Fault, I could not con&s;ent, for I loath the very Thoughts of him. Well then, <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> &s;aid I, when we have overcome all Dif|ficulties, and worn off the Remembrance of our Sufferings, I will &s;ettle a Competency for Life, that &s;hall put thee above all Fear of Want. Madam, reply'd <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> that's all I &s;hall de&s;ire; and then I'll go to &s;ome Corner of the World, live retir'd, and repent of all my pa&s;t Crimes and Follies. I told her &s;he needed not do that, &s;he might, notwith&s;tanding what was pa&s;t, live with me. No, Madam, that can never be, re|turn'd <HI>Su&s;an;</HI> for you mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity, to clear your own Reputation, divulge the Secret, and then with what Confidence &s;hall I be able to look upon any one? I told her, it would be e&s;teem'd as an Action wholly virtuous, without one Spot or Blemi&s;h. All I was capable of &s;ay|ing could not alter her Re&s;olution; but &s;he per|&s;i&s;ted in retiring from the World, and living re|clu&s;e, and I de&s;i&s;ted from &s;peaking any more up|on the Subject.</P>
<P>It had been much happier for us both, if we had never enter'd upon the Argument; for we had not remain'd &s;ilent a Moment, before the Cap|tain enter'd, with a Light in his Hand, and the utmo&s;t Fury in his Countenance. Thou Devil! &s;aid he to <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> and ha&s;t thou betray'd me, Wretch! after what I have done for thee? but I &s;hall &s;tudy &s;ome way to have ample Vengeance on thee: And for you, Madam, I &s;hall give you &s;till the &s;ame Terms and Time I fir&s;t propos'd; but that pa&s;t, expect not the lea&s;t Hope, for I will enjoy you, tho' the Moment after Death &s;hould &s;eize me. When he had done &s;peaking, he went out: But it was a con&s;iderable time ere we came out of our Surprize.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="92">
We were convinc'd that he had li&s;ten'd and overheard all our Di&s;cour&s;e, though we &s;poke but &s;oftly; and we fear'd to utter our Thoughts to one another, as imagining he would overhear us &s;till. But <HI>Su&s;an</HI> at la&s;t broke out in the&s;e Words; Good Heav'n! I hope the Puni&s;hments I am bound to &s;uffer will atone for all my Of|fences! If it will make my Peace with Thee, I'll undergo all the Torments in the World in that ble&s;t Hope! I had not Words to comfort her, for the thoughts of my own Condition ty'd up my Tongue; but the Pain of Thinking, nothing could exceed. I pray'd to God to bring me out of this Misfortune, or give me Force of Rea&s;on to &s;uffer with Patience a Di&s;&s;olution from this World. When <HI>Su&s;an</HI> heard me, &s;he told me, &s;he could &s;ee no Path to lead us thro' this Labyrinth of Misfortunes, but through the Gate of Death; and, added &s;he, &s;ince we mu&s;t die once, the &s;ooner we leave this trouble&s;ome World, the &s;ooner we &s;hall find Re&s;t.</P>
<P>Death &s;till bore to me a fro&s;ty Sound, however I &s;oon re&s;olv'd upon't; but the man|ner of it was what mo&s;t confounded me: At la&s;t we both thought of Drowning, and had re|&s;olv'd, whenever the Captain came to accompli&s;h his wicked Intent, to throw our &s;elves out of the Cabin Window. Will you &s;o? &s;aid the Captain, (who had overheard us again, for Grief had taken all Caution from us) but I'll &s;oon prevent that. He immediately took Hammer and Nails, and nail'd the Shutters &s;o clo&s;e that it was not in our weak Strength to undo them. After he was gone, we &s;pent the Night in Pray|er; and ju&s;t before the Morning dawn'd, we un|der&s;tood by the rocking of the Ship, the Noi&s;e of the Sailors, and the Loudne&s;s of the Wind, that we were in a prodigious Storm. This gave
<PB N="84" REF="93">
us Hopes that the Ship would be ca&s;t away, and that God had heard our Prayers, and would not let us lay violent Hands upon our &s;elves. Nay, deceiving Hope was ready to enter our Thoughts, that we might be ca&s;t away upon &s;ome Shore, and receive A&s;&s;i&s;tance when we lea&s;t expected it. The Storm la&s;ted the whole Day and part of the next Night; but as it &s;en&s;ibly abated, &s;o our Fears increas'd. The Captain gave us another Vi&s;it: Well, &s;aid he, Madam, I hope you have had &s;ufficient time to con&s;ider of my Propo&s;als, and I am now come for my final An&s;wer. Said I, Heav'n has given you an An|&s;wer by rai&s;ing the Storm; and if you have the lea&s;t Notion of a Divinity, you'll find 'twas his Voice that &s;pok to you in that Tempe&s;t, to de|&s;i&s;t from &s;uch a ba&s;e Attempt. Nay, Madam, if you imagine you can preach me from my De|&s;ign, preach on a God's Name. Wretch that thou art! &s;aid I, how can&s;t thou mention that &s;a|cred Name, and yet have &s;uch Thoughts as He abhors? I fancy, Madam, return'd the Brute, your Lady&s;hip feels the Influence of the Moon, and for fear I &s;hould catch the Infection, I'll leave you for a while; but with a Word by the by, If you don't con&s;ent the next time I come, by Hell! (&s;ince you will not let me mention Hea|ven) I'll not only ravi&s;h you, but every Sailor in the Ship &s;hall do &s;o too, if they think fit; and I believe they are &s;harp enough &s;ett to fall too upon wor&s;e Food than I &s;hall &s;et before them.</P>
<P>He &s;aid a great many more gro&s;s things, that would only become his Mouth to utter: And to convince you, Madam, that I will do what I &s;ay, &s;aid he, I &s;hall begin with Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an:</HI> Come Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid he to her, now I have had the fir&s;t Cut of you, I'll let my Sailors go to
<PB N="85" REF="94">
Dinner. With this he forc'd us both on the Quarter Deck, and call'd all the Seamen about him: Here my Lads, &s;aid he, I have but two dainty Bits, and I'll give you one among you, that you mayn't think I am over greedy. The Sailors &s;tar'd upon one another, and did not well know what he meant, till he told them in Terms plain enough, with Promi&s;es of Re|ward to him that would prove the greate&s;t Rogue. <HI>Su&s;an</HI> fell upon her Knees, and intreated them not to take Pattern from their barbarous Captain, but to pity a poor unfortunate Woman, reduc'd to the fatal Nece&s;&s;ity of living no lon|ger. Some of the Sailors made Sport with her Mi&s;ery, while others began to pity her. One blunt Fellow cry'd, Damn it! I love a Woman well enough, but don't care to have her forc'd upon me: It's like eating again&s;t one's Stomach. Be&s;ide, &s;aid another, I &s;uppo&s;e there's &s;ome Rea|&s;on of the Captain's Liberality, or he would not part with her. I ob&s;erv'd one of them that &s;tood at &s;ome Di&s;tance, taking Notice of what was done, without &s;eeming pleas'd. I thought I knew his Face too, and he appear'd above a common Sailor by his Looks and Cleanline&s;s. I had not till now appear'd publickly. I was determin'd to &s;peak to him, and to crave his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. A&s;&s;oon as he &s;aw me, he &s;eem'd a|maz'd, and cry'd, Ble&s;s me, Madam! how came you here? I told him I was betray'd by the Captain. I was inform'd, &s;aid he, that he had two Ladies, Pa&s;&s;engers for <HI>Zant,</HI> but I little thought you were one of them, for I was not on Board till an Hour after you arriv'd. I begg'd he would take me under his Protection; which he &s;wore with a great Oath he would, or the Captain &s;hould cut his Throat. Madam, added he, I am Mate of this Ve&s;&s;el, put in by your

honourable Father; and had been Captain, if it had not been for the Tricks of that Ra&s;cal; (pointing to the Captain.)</P>
<P>The Sailors were &s;o divided between them|&s;elves, that they had not proceeded to any Vi|olence with <HI>Su&s;an;</HI> and &s;he remain'd leaning upon the Side of the Ship, all drown'd in Tears. The Captain had all this time been laughing at the Di&s;putes of the Sailors; but perceiving the Mate in Conference with me, came up to him, and with a faucy Tone, ask'd him what Bu&s;ine&s;s he had with me. I have no other Bu&s;ine&s;s, an&s;wer'd the Mate, but to protect her from your ill U&s;age. You impertinent Cox|comb, cry'd the Captain, I'll teach you to in|termeddle with my Affairs; and upon &s;aying this, he lifted up his Hand and &s;truck him: But the Mate &s;oon return'd his Blow with Intere&s;t, and knock'd him down upon the Deck. The Sailors came and parted 'em; but the Captain &s;wore that Blow &s;hould co&s;t him his Life. He upon the In&s;tant ran into the Cabin for &s;ome In&s;trument to di&s;patch him, as was &s;uppos'd; but the Mate follow'd him clo&s;e, and, knowing his violent Temper, barr'd the Door of the Ca|bin, &s;o that the Captain remain'd a Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The Mate took from his own Cabin, which was near the Captain's, a Cutla&s;s, and put him|&s;elf again&s;t the Door, and &s;wore he would be the Death of him that fir&s;t attempted to re|lea&s;e him; and bad none of them offer to &s;tir, till they had heard what he had to &s;ay.</P>
<P>The Sailors had ca&s;t off all Thoughts from <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> to hear what the Mate could &s;ay; who declar'd who I was, and by what Means I was betray'd on Board. When the Sailors found I was their Mi&s;tre&s;s, and Owner of the Ship, they &s;oon began to repent of what they were
<PB N="87" REF="96">
going about, and declar'd they would &s;erve me with their Lives. When I found I had gain'd mo&s;t of 'em on my Side, I told 'em my Sto|ry at length, only concealing <HI>Su&s;an</HI>'s Affair with the Captain; and they &s;eem'd all prodigiou&s;ly amaz'd, and &s;tood gaping upon me like &s;o ma|ny Statues.</P>
<P>The Captain in the Cabin was all this time &s;wearing, cur&s;ing, and making a Noi&s;e at his Re&s;traint. I told the Mate, if he thought fit, we would relea&s;e him. Yes Madam, if you plea&s;e, &s;aid he, out of the Great Cabin, but we mu&s;t confine him &s;omewhere el&s;e; well know|ing his turbulent Spirit would never be ea&s;y. I told him I would be guided by him, and if he plea&s;ed to accept of the Command of the Ve&s;&s;el (if it was in my Power to give it him) it was at his Service. He return'd me a great many Thanks, and told me he would be very faithful in his Commi&s;&s;ion. We releas'd the Captain out of the Cabin, but as &s;oon as he came upon the Deck, he was &s;eiz'd, with a great deal of Difficulty, Iron'd, and confin'd to another Cabin. He rag'd like a Madman at this Treatment, but all to no Purpo&s;e. I told him he &s;hould want nothing but his Liberty, neither would I pro&s;ecute him, as his Crimes de&s;erv'd, when we arriv'd in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I de&s;ir'd the Mate to make for <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> with all the Expedition imaginable; with a Promi&s;e that I would recompen&s;e every common Sailor with double the Wages they expected for their Voyage. They all huzza'd at the News, and one and all promis'd to &s;erve me with their Lives. The Mate told me the Wind was again&s;t us in our Cour&s;e, but that he would ply it to Windward (as they call it) in Expectation of its Changing. I ask'd him whereabouts we were,
<PB N="88" REF="97">
and he told me, very near the Streights of <HI>Gi|braltar,</HI> and &s;hould have been at <HI>Zant</HI> by that time, but that they were hindred by contrary Winds, and drove back by the late Storm. I told him how the Captain had deceiv'd me, in telling me we were not &s;ix Days from the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Su&s;an</HI>'s Joy cannot be expre&s;s'd at our happy Deliverance; and you may he a&s;&s;ur'd I was as well pleas'd as &s;he was, though it did not ap|pear outwardly &s;o much: Be&s;ides I con&s;idered the Mutabilty of the things of this World; and we were &s;oon taught, by Experience, the Un|certainty of humane Affairs; for before the E|vening we were chac'd by a Rover, who &s;oon came up with us, and took us after an ob&s;ti|nate Re&s;i&s;tance; tho' we did not lo&s;e one Man, but the barbarous Captain, who was kill'd in the Place of his Confinement, without being in the Action.</P>
<P>The Captain of the Rover was the &s;ame we have now made our E&s;cape from. He never would tell me what became of <HI>Su&s;an</HI> and the Crew. Madam, &s;aid <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> I can inform you: They and all the Crew were ran&s;om'd for a thou&s;and Pound, and their Ship given them again. They did their Endeavour to ran&s;om you, but to no Purpo&s;e, for they could never learn what was become of you.</P>

<P>Mrs. <HI>Villars</HI> thus ended her Relation; only added, that the Captain fell de&s;perately in Love with her, and would never hear of her Ran&s;om; tho' he treated her with Decency, allowing her every thing but Liberty; with the conveniency of a Study of Books, which the Captain had procur'd by his Piracy; and ever left in her Clo&s;et, her Jewels, and other things of Value, that he had taken out of the Ship.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="98">
WHEN Mrs. <HI>Villars</HI> had fini&s;h'd her Story, I return'd her Thanks for the Trouble I had given her. Sir, return'd &s;he, Thanks will not recom|pen&s;e me for the Pains I have taken. I &s;hall demand the &s;ame Satisfaction from you. I told her I &s;hould readily obey her Commands; but I begg'd leave to give her the Relation in <HI>French,</HI> that our <HI>Italian</HI> might partake; for I de&s;ign, with your leave, to in&s;i&s;t of the &s;ame from him. Sir, reply'd the Lady, I would have related my un|happy Story in that Language, if you had given me the lea&s;t Hint. But however, I'll go once more over again, if you plea&s;e, in <HI>French;</HI> at lea&s;t the chief Circum&s;tances, that we may more ingage the Per&s;on to declare, how he has &s;har'd the &s;ame Fate with us. I begg'd &s;he wou'd give me leave to take that Trouble, if it were only to let her &s;ee, I had imprinted in my Memory what concern'd her &s;o &s;trongly, that I could re|peat every Circum&s;tance. She gave me leave to proceed, on which I told her Story over again in <HI>French,</HI> to the <HI>Italian.</HI> When I had fini&s;h'd, &s;he gave me Thanks, for the Pains I had taken. Tho' I had not been &s;o long in the Relation, yet I made up the Time in de&s;canting upon her Danger, and hard Fate. That a Lady of her Birth, Beauty, and E&s;tate, &s;hould be &s;o far for|&s;aken by Fortune, as to be reduc'd to wretched Slavery.</P>
<P>I then began my own Story, from my Birth, to our pre&s;ent State. Tho' in what related to my Pa&s;&s;ion for the Lady, I did not directly ex|plain; yet I gave her Hints enough to under|&s;tand, &s;he was the Idol of my Soul, and (tho' Love like Hope does oft deceive us) I thought my ob&s;cure Declaration did not di&s;plea&s;e her.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="99">
We then de&s;ir'd the <HI>Italian</HI> to proceed in his Relation. He &s;ighing, told us, he was too much oblig'd to me, to refu&s;e me any thing, tho' it would call to his Remembrance Tran&s;actions, that would bring Tears into his Eyes. After &s;ome Pau&s;e he began to this Effect.</P>

<HEAD>THE STORY OF THE <HI>ITALIAN</HI> SLAVE.</HEAD>
<P>_I Was born at the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> re|nown'd for its Grandeur and Anti|quity, and I may &s;ay without boa&s;t|ing, of a noble Family; but had the Misfortune to come la&s;t into the World, and the younge&s;t, of five Sons and two Daughters. My Father had a plentiful Fortune, but before his Death he had much weaken'd it, in giving Dowries to my two Si&s;ters, who were both marry'd far above their Fortunes, tho' not equal to their Birth. But Riches now ballance every Thing, and weigh down Birth and humble Vir|tue, and he that has mo&s;t Gold, is the greate&s;t Man.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="100">
We lo&s;t our Mother in our early Days; and my Father follow'd, before I was ten Years old, having &s;ettled all his E&s;tate on his elde&s;t Son to keep up the Grandeur of the Name, and left three Brothers of us to depend on him.</P>
<P>My Father in his Life-time gave us an Edu|cation &s;uitable to our Birth and Family; and my Brother, to give him his Due, compleated us. Two of my Brothers he procur'd Po&s;ts in the Army for, who both lo&s;t their Lives in one glorious Campaign. The other dyed young.</P>
<P>It was imagin'd by every body that had the Privilege to think for me, that their Deaths would be of no &s;mall Advantage to me; and it had for &s;ome Years the Appearance of it. My Brother had attain'd to his thirtieth Year, with|out once ever thinking of Marriage. But an advan|tageous Match being propos'd, it was thought convenient for him to pur&s;ue it. The Lady that was de&s;ign'd for him he had never &s;een; but he was inform'd &s;he was young, rich, and beautiful. He was brought to the Sight of her, and fell violently in Love with her at the fir&s;t Vi&s;it, and his Pa&s;&s;ion encreas'd every Moment. The Day was fixt for their Nuptials by the Father of the Lady, which was to be the <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> fol|lowing. I had attain'd to my eighteenth Year, and no Provi&s;ion made for me; and it was thought that this Match would not bring me the lea&s;t Advantage.</P>
<P>One Day my Brother told me, he had pro|cur'd me the Po&s;t of Captain of the Pope's Guards; and tho' it was far beneath my Birth, yet I was pleas'd with it, that I might have the Means to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without being &s;ubject to the Caprice of Fortune, and the Dependance of a Brother of an uncertain Temper. My Bro|ther having &s;ome urgent Affairs, that call'd him
<PB N="92" REF="101">
ha&s;tily out of Town, he gave me a Letter to de|liver to his Mi&s;tre&s;s, which was to excu&s;e his &s;udden Departure.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as he was gone, I went to execute his Commi&s;&s;ion; and being known to be the Bro|ther of the intended Husband, had the Liberty of pre&s;enting the Letter to the Lady's own Hands. But what Misfortunes did that Inter|view co&s;t me! I no &s;ooner &s;aw her, but I lo&s;t my Heart, and the Regard I ow'd my Brother was of no Force again&s;t her Charms. I ob&s;erv'd &s;he perus'd the Letter with Indifferency, which did not di&s;plea&s;e me. Yet I &s;o far overcame my growing Pa&s;&s;ion, as to add &s;omething to the Excu&s;e my Brother had wrote. I ob&s;erv'd, in our Conver&s;ation, that the propos'd Alliance was not very plea&s;ing to her; and &s;he at la&s;t frank|ly told me, Duty, more than Inclination, would make her comply with it. I told her, were my Brother's Condition mine, and I had been ac|quainted with her Sentiments, I &s;hould not have the Fortitude to &s;upport my ill Fortune; yet &s;hould have &s;o much Regard to her, whatever were my Troubles, not to be oblig'd to Duty, but Inclination.</P>
<P>She told me, with a ri&s;ing Blu&s;h, tho&s;e E&s;pou|&s;als never pro&s;per'd, where the Hand could not be&s;tow the Heart. I agreed with her Senti|ments; but added, I fear'd her Heart was al|ready given, where &s;he could not be&s;tow her Hand.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I have ever been a Friend to Plain|dealing, and Truth appears &s;o amiable to me, that I neither will, nor can deny it to you. O happy Man, cry'd I, who-e'er thou art! Fortune has &s;hed her happie&s;t Influence on thee, and it is not in her Power to make thee mi&s;erable, when ble&s;t with &s;o much con&s;enting Beauty.
<PB N="93" REF="102">
Sir, return'd the Lady, the Per&s;on you e&s;teem &s;o happy, is ignorant of my Inclinations for him, and Fear will make me conceal the Secret. And the chief Rea&s;on why I di&s;clo&s;e it to you, is, that you would inform your Brother; for (ad|ded &s;he, with Tears) if I am forc'd to wed him, I &s;hall be for ever mi&s;erable. Her Grief touch'd me to the Heart, and &s;he ob&s;erv'd the Sorrow in my Face. I perceive, &s;aid &s;he, the Love you bear your Brother affects your Brea&s;t. Madam, &s;aid I, &s;ince you have made me this frank De|claration, I al&s;o will be free, and utter all my Heart. The Grief you &s;ee ri&s;ing in my Face, is owing to the Torments of my Soul. The very Moment I beheld your Charms, Love &s;hot me with his &s;harpe&s;t pointed Dart, and all the Hope I have is cold De&s;pair. She ob&s;erv'd my Decla|ration with a great deal of Satisfaction, and re|main'd &s;ilent &s;ome time, viewing me &s;tedfa&s;tly: Upon which I ca&s;t my Eyes upon the Ground. Sir, &s;aid &s;he (with an unconfirm'd Voice) I hope you are &s;incere in what you &s;ay, for the Suppo|&s;ition of it will draw another Secret from me, which is this; The Rea&s;on why I cannot love your Brother is, that I have long &s;ince given my Heart to&mdash;you: The fir&s;t time I &s;aw your Face, it left its peaceful man&s;ion of Repo&s;e, and fled for Shelter to a Stranger's Brea&s;t. The Joy I felt at this free Declaration &s;o tran&s;ported me, that I knew not whether I dreamt or no; but being convinc'd of the Reality, I threw my &s;elf at her Feet, and uttered all my Tongue could expre&s;s, &s;lowing from a &s;incere Heart. She told me &s;he had re&s;olv'd on Death, before &s;he would con&s;ent to wed my Brother: And inform'd me al&s;o, that her Pa&s;&s;ion had been increa&s;ing up|wards of two Years. The fir&s;t time &s;he &s;aw me, was taking my leave of my Brothers, when
<PB N="94" REF="103">
they were going to that Campaign, from which they never return'd. In &s;hort, we were as much in Love, as ever any two were.</P>
<P>We agreed to meet the next Day, at the &s;ame Place, where I had the Liberty of coming, as her Brother-in-Law that was to be.</P>
<P>I was Impatient for the next Day, imagining Time to have no Wings. But the happy Moment came at la&s;t. We talk'd of nothing for &s;everal Hours, but our mutual Love; at la&s;t we fell on the ungrateful Subject of the approaching Nuptials, and how we &s;hould prevent 'em. I propos'd to her, running away, and tying our &s;elves fa&s;t by the &s;acred Bond of Wedlock. Though, &s;aid &s;he, I will never be any one's but yours, yet we mu&s;t con&s;ider of Futurity: I know your Fortune is but &s;mall, and mine, tho' a large one, depends upon my Father: I'll find &s;ome Means to defer the Marriage; you may do your Endeavour to di&s;&s;wade your Bro|ther, for I fancy Fortune more than Beauty has gain'd his Heart. I a&s;&s;ur'd her to the con|trary, and that he was very much in Love with her. We both wi&s;h'd it had been otherways, but re&s;olv'd to love on. We parted, tho' we had not re&s;olv'd on any thing, and appointed to meet the next Day, in a private Corner of the Town, at an Acquaintance of mine, that I could confide in; tho' I would not tru&s;t him with the Secret, well knowing a Matter of Impor|tance in&s;laves the Per&s;on that di&s;clo&s;es it. I told him I had an Intrigue with a Per&s;on of Qua|lity, that I mu&s;t be obliged to carry on at his Hou&s;e; which he con&s;ented to very willingly. We met according to our Appointment, but an Hour before the time prefixt, not willing one &s;hould be before the other. She came alone too, for &s;he would not tru&s;t any of her Servants. We
<PB N="95" REF="104">
met there every Day; and one time above the re&s;t, Love being pregnant in both our Eyes, I took the happy Opportunity, and was ble&s;s'd in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all I wi&s;h'd on Earth: But Enjoyment was &s;o far from palling my De&s;ires, that it rather encreas'd 'em. We liv'd in all the Delight of Love for a Month, but then came the Bitter to all our Sweets. My Brother arriv'd, and the fatal Day appointed for the Mar|riage aproach'd. We had given our &s;elves up &s;o intirely to Love, that we did not think of what was to come; or if the intruding Thought did creep in, we would immediately lull it to Re&s;t like a froward Child.</P>
<P>When we parted, it was with &s;uch a Regret and Sorrow, that foreboded our ill Fortune. The Father of my Mi&s;tre&s;s had order'd every thing for the Nuptial Solemnity, with the great|e&s;t Magnificence; but two Days before it was to be &s;olemniz'd, it was reported all over <HI>Rome</HI> that <HI>Don Antonio Grimaldi</HI>'s only Daughter (who was my Mi&s;tre&s;s) was taken dangerou&s;ly ill. I was not di&s;pleas'd at the Rumour, as gue&s;&s;ing her De|&s;ign. My Brother was never from her, and I was pretty well a&s;&s;ur'd the Sight of him gave her a great deal of Pain. One Day finding my Brother very melancholy, I ask'd him if it was the Indi&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Grimaldi</HI>'s Daughter that occa&s;ion'd the Gloom I ob&s;erved in his Coun|tenance. He reply'd &s;he was the Cau&s;e of what he felt: He farther added, that he thought her Sickne&s;s counterfeit, only to avoid him; and that he had many Rea&s;ons to believe &s;he had given her Heart to another. I us'd many Ar|guments with him to leave her, and that &s;he was not worth his farther Thought. But he a&s;&s;ur'd me it was not in his Power to hate her. I began to reflect with Rea&s;on on the Conduct
<PB N="96" REF="105">
of my Love, and found I had involv'd my &s;elf in a very dangerous and trouble&s;ome Affair: But notwith&s;tanding all my Rea&s;onings, I found my &s;elf more and more in Love; and Ab|&s;ence, which cures a light Pa&s;&s;ion, added Strength to mine; for I had not &s;een her in fifteen Days. I was re&s;olved at la&s;t to vi&s;it her, and took the Opportunity when my Brother was with the <HI>Pope</HI> in his Clo&s;et. I found it no Difficulty to gain Admittance, knowing who I was: But not|with&s;tanding all my Endeavours, could not get an Opportunity of &s;peaking to her, there being a great many Vi&s;itants. I took an Occa&s;ion of feeling her Pul&s;e, and we had the Happine&s;s of moulding our Hands for a Moment. I dur&s;t not &s;tay long, for fear my Brother &s;hould come while I was there; and yet I had re&s;olv'd to inform him of my Vi&s;it, which I did the fir&s;t time of our Meeting; but added, that it was Curio|&s;ity, and to oblige him, that I gave my &s;elf that Trouble. He thank'd me, and ask'd me what I thought of her Indi&s;po&s;ition. I told him I could not an&s;wer for the State of her Heart, but I was a&s;&s;ur'd that her Body was in a violent Fever. This I &s;aid, a little to unde|ceive him; for &s;ince he could not be per&s;uaded to abandon her, I thought it would be more to our Advantage to make him believe it was a real Indi&s;po&s;ition. He went to make her a Vi&s;it that Evening, and at his Return told me I had given him true Information, for the Phy|&s;icians had order'd her to be let Blood, and that &s;he was in a dangerous Fever, and her Fa|ther de&s;ign'd to &s;end her into the Country the next Day. I was mightily pleas'd that he was deceiv'd as well as the Father, and I did not doubt but &s;he had per&s;uaded the Phy&s;icians to favour the Deceit.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="106">
Accordingly the next Day &s;he was convey'd in a Litter, to a Country Hou&s;e of her Father's, two Leagues from <HI>Rome</HI> upon the River <HI>Tyber.</HI> I flatter'd my &s;elf, that her being in the Country would give me a fairer Opportunity of conver|&s;ing with her: But though I try'd all the Me|thods imaginable, I could not find the lea&s;t Glimp&s;e of Hope in above &s;ix Weeks time. I was perfectly like a mad Creature, and all my Friends (particularly my Brother) took Notice of my Unea&s;ine&s;s. But I kept the Cau&s;e of it in|tirely to my &s;elf.</P>
<P>Any one that's a Judge of Love, and has ever been in my Circum&s;tances, may gue&s;s at what I felt. All I cou'd learn of my Mi&s;tre&s;s was, that &s;he continu'd very ill. My Mind was tortur'd with a thou&s;and Imaginations: Sometimes I thought her fal&s;e, and that it was her own De&s;ire which kept me from &s;eeing her; at other times I fancy'd &s;he was really indi&s;pos'd.</P>
<P>A Month more &s;lip'd away, and I was as un|likely to &s;ee her then as at fir&s;t. One Morning my Brother came into my Chamber, before I was dre&s;t. He &s;eem'd over-complai&s;ant to me, and expre&s;s'd a Concern for the Alteration of my Temper. I fancy (&s;aid he) Brother, that Love has forc'd him&s;elf into your Brea&s;t; and that the Object of your Pa&s;&s;ion has no Regard to the Torments you endure. I excus'd my &s;elf to him, that Love had no concern in my Humour, but rather an inward Indi&s;po&s;iti|on of Body. He &s;aid many kind things upon that Occa&s;ion, promis'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t me all he could, and left me.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as he was gone, I dre&s;s'd my &s;elf, and got on Hor&s;eback, in order once more to try my Fortune; and I had taken a Re&s;olution to &s;ee my Mi&s;tre&s;s, whatever Hazard I &s;hould run.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="107">
When I came upon the skirt of a Wood, within half a League of the Place where I was going, I was &s;urrounded by a dozen Men on Hor&s;eback, who (notwith&s;tanding the Re&s;i&s;tance I made) got me down, bound me, and carry'd me into the Wood. I imagin'd 'em to be Thieves, by their Proceeding; but they never once attempted to take any thing from me, which alter'd my Opinion, and I began to think they had a De&s;ign upon my Life.</P>
<P>The State and Uncertainty of my Love made Death look like a Friend.</P>
<P>They kept me in the Wood till the Dusk of the Evening, then clapt me into a Litter, and tra|vell'd hard all Night. The next Morning I was put into a Boat, and hurry'd on board a Ve&s;&s;el that lay a League off at Sea. A&s;&s;oon as they had receiv'd me, they weighted and &s;et Sail; and the Per&s;on that &s;eem'd to have Command in the Boat, prov'd to be the Captain of the Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>They carry'd me bound into his Cabin. When we were alone, he gave me a Paper, which I &s;oon knew to be my Brother's Hand-writing; and in it an open Letter, who&s;e Hand I could not tell by the Direction. Upon this the <HI>Italian</HI> took 'em both out of his Bo&s;om. See, &s;aid he, the fatal Scroll, which has robb'd me of all Joy in this Life, and which I have kept during my Captivity.</P>

<HEAD><HI>To</HI> Antonio Alvares.</HEAD>
<P>LIFE of my Life! I have re&s;olv'd to hazard e|very thing to let you know the State of my Body and Mind. Though Body, Life, and Heart are entirely thine, yet I fear Death will rob thee of 'em. My counterfeit Illne&s;s, that Day you &s;aw me, (without having the Happine&s;s of &s;peaking to each o|ther) brought a real Di&s;temper upon me, and my Fever took away my Under&s;tanding. I hope I have not in my Ravings declar'd the Secret of my Soul. The Sight of your Brother retards my Health, and the Hopes I have of my Recovery, is once more to &s;ee thee, thou Darling of my Heart. I have prevail'd upon one of my Women, with Pre&s;ents and Promi&s;es (whom I hope is hone&s;t) to deliver this to thee. Our private Meetings, I fear, will prove fatal to me; for I find our Commerce, if I &s;urvive, will make me a Mo|ther; but for fear it may touch me more in what thou art to &s;uffer, if known to be the Father, Death &s;hall relea&s;e thee from that Danger.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Upon the reading of the&s;e two Letters, dif|ferent Pa&s;&s;ions &s;well'd in my Soul. My Heart was torn with Agonies for her I lov'd, and my Brea&s;t was fir'd with Revenge again&s;t my unna|tural Brother: For as he had &s;hook off all Bro|therly
<PB N="100" REF="109">
Love, I thought it was but Ju&s;tice I &s;hould do &s;o too.</P>
<P>I &s;at a con&s;iderable time in the utmo&s;t Agony, not for fear of Death; for I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I had not the lea&s;t Thought about it. The Captain of the Ve&s;&s;el &s;eeing me in that Condition, &s;poke to me after this manner. Sir, tho' I am well paid by your Brother, to end your Life, yet I have &s;o much Compa&s;&s;ion for your Sufferings, (knowing your Crime to be only Love) to mitigate your Sentence, I'll put you into a Boat, with two Men to conduct you, and every thing that &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary: Upon this Condition, that you will give me your Word and Honour, not to appear at <HI>Rome</HI> in forty Days.</P>
<P>I thank'd him for his Kindne&s;s, gave him my Word, and told him it was not in fear of Death, but only to di&s;appoint my barbarous Brother. Immediately a Boat was hoi&s;ted out, and every thing that was needful for a Month's Voyage. My two Men were paid for the Voyage before-hand, and we left the Ship. I I order'd 'em to &s;teer for <HI>Leghorn,</HI> becau&s;e there I could be furni&s;h'd with every thing that I wanted, from my Si&s;ter, who had re&s;ided there two Years with her Husband, a Nobleman of <HI>Florence.</HI> But the Wind not proving favourable, we were drove out of our intended Cour&s;e, and had it not been for a <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, bound for <HI>Malta,</HI> who took us up, we had certainly pe|ri&s;h'd. And happy for me, had it been my Fate to have had a Wave for my Winding-&s;heet; for two Days after we were received on Board, a Cor&s;air of <HI>Barbary</HI> met with us, and took us all Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>I made no extraordinary Appearance, being I was always di&s;guis'd when I went to the Hou&s;e where my Mi&s;tre&s;s lay indi&s;pos'd. <HI>Hamet</HI>

So that I either fear'd my Letters had mi&s;carry'd, or they were willing to forget an unhappy Wretch like my Self.

<P>WHEN he had ended his Story, we condol'd with one another, for our Misfortues had a Re|&s;emblance. By this time the Day began to dawn, and <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> told us we &s;hould reach <HI>Magazan</HI> before Night. We were all mightily overjoy'd, becau&s;e we expected to be a Day longer in our Voyage. I begg'd the Favour of Mrs. <HI>Villars,</HI> to let me clean&s;e her Face from the Om|bre; which &s;he con&s;ented to. I was fill'd with Contemplation of her Beauty, but was rous'd from tho&s;e plea&s;ing Thoughts, by the Appear|ance of &s;everal lowring Clouds that &s;eem'd to threaten us with a Hurrican, frequent in tho&s;e Parts; and tho' they &s;eldom la&s;t long, yet they might prove dangerous to our &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P><HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> advis'd to make to Shore, but I could by no Per&s;ua&s;ion agree to that, but ordered him to hold on his Cour&s;e for <HI>Magazan.</HI> But the Tempe&s;t ro&s;e &s;o &s;uddenly, and &s;o violent, that we were oblig'd to leave our &s;elves to the Mer|cy of the Waves; and we did not know which way we drove, for the dark Clouds had almo&s;t form'd another Night.</P>
<P>Our Boat was a new &s;tout Boat, and bore the Weather very well, but it frighten'd Mrs. <HI>Vil|lars</HI> very much; and I had no other Regard but for her. The Tempe&s;t continu'd for near half
<PB N="102" REF="111">
the Day, and when it grew Calm, and clear'd up, we were not in Sight of Land. By good Fortune I had provided a Compa&s;s; and I or|der'd <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> to &s;teer due South, the &s;ame Cour&s;e we kept before the Storm began, which was before the Wind. But tho' we had &s;ail'd &s;everal Hours South, we could not di&s;cover any Land. <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> advis'd us to put to Wind|ward back, for he did not douht but we had over-&s;hot <HI>Magazan</HI> in the Storm.</P>
<P>We were preparing to tack about, when we di&s;cover'd a Sail, within half a League of us; for it was hazy Weather, notwith&s;tanding the Storm was over, or we &s;hould have perceiv'd her time enough to have avoided her. We kept upon a Wind, and it fre&s;hning upon us, our Sail &s;plit, and we found it was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid the Ship, who gain'd upon us every Mo|ment. We thought it our wi&s;e&s;t Cour&s;e to lye by, and wait for her. Now all the Hope we had was, that the Ve&s;&s;el would prove a Ship of <HI>Europe.</HI> I de&s;ir'd Mrs. <HI>Villars</HI> to conceal her Sex, and begg'd the Favour of the <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;ta|pha</HI> to keep the Secret. The Ship was near us, and to our &s;urprizing Joy, hoi&s;ted <HI>French</HI> Co|lours. We immediately put on Board, becau&s;e they lay by on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>We were &s;oon inform'd Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pidau de St. Olon</HI> was on Board, the Amba&s;&s;ador from the King of <HI>France</HI> to the Emperor of <HI>Morocco,</HI> to treat of Peace between the two Crowns. I immedi|ately begg'd to be brought to the Amba&s;&s;ador's Pre&s;ence, who receiv'd us very kindly. I told him all our Stories, but conceal'd that of Mrs. <HI>Villars,</HI> for fear of any Accident. He us'd us very civilly, and promis'd us his Protection. He &s;aid his Affair would not detain him long, and he would be &s;ure to gain &s;afe Conduct for us into our own Country.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="112">
I return'd him Thanks for his generous Prof|fer, and begg'd he would command my Life, to &s;ee how readily I would obey him. He told me, &s;ince I was willing to oblige him, he would &s;oon put it in my Power to &s;erve him.</P>
<P>I have, &s;aid he, lo&s;t three of my Retinue in the Voyage, two by Sickne&s;s, and one drown'd by Accident. You'll ju&s;t make up that Num|ber, and you need not take any Care for Habits; I will provide for you. The fourth Per&s;on in your Company I believe you'll be &s;atisfy'd &s;hould be taken Care of on Board our Ship, for his Landing on the <HI>African</HI> Coa&s;t may prove prejudicial to your Affairs. I was mightily pleas'd with his Propo&s;als, and communicated it to Mrs. <HI>Villars</HI> and our <HI>Italian</HI> Gentleman. Mrs. <HI>Villars</HI> told me, &s;he was intirely under my Con|duct, and the <HI>Italian</HI> thought he &s;hould have a better Opportunity of getting into his own Country from <HI>Mequinez,</HI> than <HI>France.</HI> I would not &s;uffer Mon&s;ieur <HI>St. Olon</HI> to cloath us as he propos'd; for I had procur'd of the <HI>Jew</HI> four rich Suits of <HI>European</HI> Cloaths, for a Trifle, which I de&s;ign'd for Mrs. <HI>Villars,</HI> and my &s;elf; for we intended &s;he &s;hould put off her <HI>Moor|i&s;h</HI> Dre&s;s, the fir&s;t Opportunity.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador provided a Cabin for Mrs. <HI>Villars</HI> and me; and he &s;eem'd mightily taken with her Youth and Beauty, (as a Boy;) and he would often &s;ay, Nature had mi&s;taken her, de|&s;igning her for the faire&s;t of the &s;ofte&s;t Sex. The&s;e Encomiums made me very unea&s;y, fearing he &s;hould find out the Truth. But I under&s;tood afterwards, he had not the lea&s;t Mi&s;tru&s;t.</P>
<P>He treated us very &s;plendidly at Supper, con|&s;idering we were at Sea. When the Amba&s;&s;a|dor went to Re&s;t, Mrs. <HI>Villars</HI> and I retir'd to the Cabin allotted us. What a &s;en&s;ible Plea&s;ure did I
<PB N="104" REF="113">
feel, to have the Happine&s;s of her Company alone, without the Fears and Terrors of offending any one! She perceiv'd a Satisfaction in my Countenance, that &s;poke the Joy of my Heart; and by her Di&s;|cour&s;e that en&s;u'd, &s;he was in &s;ome Fear, le&s;t a guilty Thought had work'd that Change.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) I hope you know what Regard to pay my Sex, and do not wrong the good Opinion I have conceiv'd of you. I own the greate&s;t Obligation to you, and I am not di&s;pleas'd I am in your Power, while you u&s;e that Power with Moderation. I had hardly the Patience to hear her out. Madam, return'd I, be a&s;&s;ur'd, your own Soul &s;hall not be more pure than my Thoughts. But yet, I will take the Freedom to declare, no Per&s;on in the World has that Command over me as you have. I mu&s;t own you have it in your Power to puni&s;h me, by &s;lighting a Heart full of the mo&s;t tender Regard for you; and all I ask, is only leave to hope; if I am de|ny'd that, the utmo&s;t of my Re&s;entments to you, &s;hall only be in hating Life, which will be a Burden not able for me long to bear. It would be ba&s;e in me, (return'd Mrs. <HI>Villars)</HI> to give Tormens where I am oblig'd; I think to di&s;gui&s;e our Thoughts, is an Art better lo&s;t, than learnt: And to deal frankly with you, I cannot find in my Heart any Aver&s;ion for you; which is a Declaration, if you knew my Temper, ought to &s;atisfie you. I &s;aid all the tender things I was capable of, in return for this great Ble&s;|&s;ing, and our Conver&s;ation la&s;ted &s;everal Hours. I told her at la&s;t, I was well a&s;&s;ur'd &s;he wanted Re&s;t; and whatever Plea&s;ure I took in her Com|pany, I would deprive my &s;elf of it, and leave her to her Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>She &s;eem'd very much concern'd, that I was oblig'd to leave her alone; well knowing I
<PB N="105" REF="114">
&s;hould not get the Convenience of a Place to re&s;t my &s;elf.</P>
<P>I told her there was not any Fatigue I would not undergo for her with Plea&s;ure. I left her, and Night &s;oon &s;lipt away in plea&s;ing Imagina|tions. I was &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee her, who was ever in my Thoughts, come out of the Cabin dre&s;s'd. Madam, &s;aid I to her, I hope you have had no|thing to di&s;turb your Sleep. She obligingly an|&s;wer'd me, Nothing but the Thoughts of your waking; and therefore &s;he de&s;ir'd I would go and repo&s;e my &s;elf in the Cabin, and I think, &s;aid &s;he, 'tis my Duty to watch now. I excus'd my &s;elf, and told her it was but for one Night more, for in all Probability we &s;hould land the next Day, and provide our &s;elves with better Accommodation.</P>
<P>We went into the Cabin together, and our Conver&s;ation chiefly center'd on Love. She told me at la&s;t, &s;he would leave her Acknowledg|ments to me, till &s;he was more at Liberty, and in her own Country, for fear I &s;hould imagine the Need &s;he had of my Service &s;hould make her declare her &s;elf in my Favour. When I found &s;o fair a Beginning, I was re&s;olv'd to pu&s;h my Fortune; till with many Intreaties, Vows, and Oaths of my Fidelity, &s;he own'd to me &s;he had a tender Re|gard for me when &s;he &s;aw me fir&s;t, for &s;he was convinc'd of my Love at our fir&s;t Conver&s;ation; not, continu'd &s;he, that I had any Under&s;tand|ing in the Art of Love, but I knew the Ha|zard you had put your &s;elf in to &s;erve me, could have no other Motive but that Pa&s;&s;ion; and the more I thought of it, the more I found my Heart inclining to believe you.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Per&s;ons that have felt the &s;oft Pa&s;&s;ion, may make a Judgment of the Tran&s;ports I was in at this Declaration. I ki&s;s'd her Hand a thou|&s;and
<PB N="106" REF="115">
times, and pre&s;s'd it to my Heart. She begg'd me to curb my Tran&s;port, for fear of being overheard or ob&s;erved; for, continu'd &s;he, you may remember, in my Relation of my Mi&s;|fortunes, how near we were &s;uffering by &s;uch an Over&s;ight. This kind Caution bridled my Tongue, but could not command my Eyes; they &s;poke the Language of my Soul.</P>
<P>Our &s;ilent Conver&s;ation was di&s;turb'd by the Joy of the Sailors in di&s;covering Land; and we thought it prudent to wait on the Amba&s;&s;ador, and congratulate him upon it. He receiv'd us very kindly, and told us he was pleas'd upon our Accounts, that we might recover on Shore the Fatigue of the Sea and our Captivity. The Captain told us we &s;hould come to an Anchor before Dinner in the Port of <HI>Mammora.</HI> I was mightily &s;urpriz'd to find we were got to the South of <HI>Sallee,</HI> and found that the Tempe&s;t had drove us back beyond <HI>Sallee</HI> &s;everal Leagues. This we &s;till e&s;teem'd a greater Happine&s;s, and if <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> had not been guided by me, we had mi&s;s'd the good Fortune of meeting with the <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, and of cour&s;e made the Port of <HI>Sallee</HI> whether we would or no. Upon this Thought, I began to imagine that <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> as under&s;tanding the Mathematicks, knew where we were, and con&s;equently had de&s;ign'd to be|tray us. I communicated my Thoughts to Mon|&s;ieur St. <HI>Olon,</HI> and he came into my Sentiments. He immediately call'd the Captain of the Ship, and order'd <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> to be &s;trictly guarded in his Ab&s;ence; and if any <HI>Moors</HI> came on Board, to prevent his &s;eeing of them; but de&s;ir'd that he might want nothing but his Liberty. When we came to an Anchor, the Captain was &s;ent on Shore to acquaint the <HI>Moors</HI> with the Ar|rival of an Amba&s;&s;ador from <HI>France;</HI> and pre|&s;ently
<PB N="107" REF="116">
the Fort &s;aluted him with one and twen|ty Guns, which was return'd from the Ship Gun for Gun. The Governour of <HI>Mammora</HI> in an Hour's time came on Board attended, who &s;aluted our Amba&s;&s;ador, and begg'd he would have Patience to &s;tay in the Ship, till he had acquainted the Emperor his Ma&s;ter with his Arrival. The Amba&s;&s;ador invited him to an Entertainment; and tho' I ob&s;erv'd he refus'd Wine, yet he and his Retinue &s;wallow'd the Punch &s;o fa&s;t that their Heads prov'd as light as their Heels. When they went on Shore a|gain, the Cannon of the Ship gave 'em a Salvo, which was return'd by the Fort a&s;&s;oon as ever they were landed. The next Day an Order came from the Emperor that we &s;hould immediately repair to <HI>Mequinez,</HI> the Place where the Empe|ror re&s;ided.</P>
<P>The next Day the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;et forward with his whole Retinue, among which were Mrs. <HI>Villars,</HI> the <HI>Italian,</HI> and my &s;elf, dre&s;t richly after the <HI>Euro|pean</HI> Fa&s;hion. We were provided with <HI>Drome|daries</HI> to carry us, all but the Amba&s;&s;ador, who was pre&s;ented with an <HI>Arabian</HI> Cour&s;er. With|in a Mile or two of <HI>Mequinez</HI> we perceiv'd the King at the Head of his Army in a great Plain. At fir&s;t I thought it a Mark of Re&s;pect to the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>France;</HI> but found it was purely Accident, for our Guide led us out of the Way to avoid 'em.</P>
<P>When we arriv'd at <HI>Mequinez,</HI> we were led to a Hou&s;e belonging to the <HI>French</HI> Con&s;ul, or rather a Hou&s;e he had hir'd for that Occa&s;ion. Before we were well enter'd the Hou&s;e, a Guard of <HI>Moors</HI> was fixt upon us, and &s;trict Orders given not a Soul &s;hould &s;tir out, not even the Amba&s;&s;ador nor Con&s;ul. I thought this an odd Proceeding, and &s;ometimes imagin'd it was upon
<PB N="108" REF="117">
our Account, (as Fear is an expeditious Pain|ter.) But my Timerity vani&s;h'd, when Mon&s;ieur St. <HI>Olon</HI> inform'd me, it was the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Cu&s;tom not to let a Foreign Amba&s;&s;ador give or receive Vi&s;its till after his fir&s;t Audience.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Villars</HI> and I had one Apartment alotted us, with but one Bed in it, after the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Manner. She told me, &s;he could not bear the Thoughts of my watching every Night, and begg'd I would go to Re&s;t with the <HI>Itali|an;</HI> but we found he was provided of a Compa|nion, one of the Retinue, and there was no help for it. I always retir'd when my Mi&s;tre&s;s undre&s;s'd her&s;elf, and gave her time to go into Bed: I then with a Quilt laid my &s;elf down on the Floor, but was far from taking any Repo&s;e. The Thoughts of the Woman I lov'd being &s;o near me, naked in Bed, kindled &s;uch a De&s;ire in my Brea&s;t; and the Pain I took to &s;mother it, perfectly burnt me up. I would have my Readers excu&s;e me, if they are di&s;oblig'd at any Part of my Story, becau&s;e I am only relating Matters of Fact.</P>
<P>The next Day, when I ro&s;e from my board|ed Bed, I retir'd to give the Load&s;tone of my De&s;ires time to dre&s;s her &s;elf: When I enter'd the Room again, &s;he ob&s;erv'd my Countenance very attentively, and told me &s;he was griev'd to find in my Features &s;omething that &s;poke a di&s;order'd Body; which I am &s;ure, &s;aid &s;he, is for want of Re&s;t: But, added &s;he, I beg it as a Favour, you will immediately undre&s;s your &s;elf, and go into Bed, and try to repo&s;e your &s;elf, and I'll make your Excu&s;e to the Amba&s;&s;a|dor. I refus'd it a great while, but in &s;hort &s;he forc'd me to comply with her Commands. I went to Bed, but new Thoughts again at|tack'd me, and drove Sleep away. Mrs. <HI>Villars</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="118">
had retir'd, and &s;taid about an Hour. When &s;he came in again, &s;he &s;tole &s;oftly for fear of di&s;turbing me. My Mind was &s;o violently agi|tated, that I really began to be out of Order, and feaveri&s;h, which &s;he ob&s;erv'd, and came to the Bed-&s;ide, and with a tender Inquietude ask'd me how I did. I took hold of her Hand, pre&s;s'd it to my Lips, and thank'd her for her kind Care of me. Alas! &s;he cry'd, you are very much indi&s;pos'd, and I am the Cau&s;e of it. Upon this the Tears ran down her Cheeks, like Morning Dew on Ro&s;es. Her Tenderne&s;s gave me all the Joy imaginable; and as &s;he lean'd her Head over me, weeping, I pre&s;s'd her &s;oft Lips clo&s;e to mine, which plung'd my Soul in Ec&s;ta|&s;ies of Joy. She blu&s;h'd at my Freedom, yet &s;till begg'd I would try to &s;leep. I told her it was impo&s;&s;ible, while &s;he was there; upon this &s;he was going to retire in ha&s;te, but I caught her by the &s;oft Hand, and told her if &s;he went out it would be a greater Impo&s;&s;ibili|ty for me to re&s;t. She conjur'd me by that Love I profe&s;s'd, (if it was not a Fal&s;hood) to declare to her the Torments of my Mind. She in&s;i&s;ted &s;o much upon't, that I told her the Secret of my Heart. She fell upon her Knees, and begg'd I would not mention it any more, for &s;he own'd her &s;elf &s;o much oblig'd to me, there was not any thing in her Power &s;he could refu&s;e me, but that. I begg'd her Pardon, and had re&s;olv'd to &s;uffer Death &s;ooner than to have di&s;clos'd my Malady; but I would be ever &s;ilent upon that Theme, till &s;he com|manded me to &s;peak. My dear <HI>Boyle,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, (I am not a&s;ham'd to call you &s;o) &s;tay till we arrive in <HI>England,</HI> and I here vow to make you mine, whenever you &s;hall command me. Upon &s;aying this &s;he join'd her Lips to mine, not
<PB N="110" REF="119">
con&s;idering that in endeavouring to &s;uppre&s;s my Flame, &s;he pour'd Oyl upon it, and made it burn the fiercer. I told her, true Love was above nice Formality, and that Marriages were made in Heaven. Said &s;he, I hope they are, but beg by both our Loves to drop this Theme. I told her I would, tho' Death &s;hould follow. I remain'd &s;ilent for &s;ome time, while Tears &s;topt her Speech. We were interrupted by a Me&s;|&s;enger from the Amba&s;&s;ador, who came to invite us to Dinner, (for he always did us the Favour of dining at his Table.) I begg'd to be excus'd, for I found my &s;elf a little indi&s;pos'd. The Me&s;|&s;enger had not been gone a Moment before the Amba&s;&s;ador came in to enquire after my Health, and brought his Phy&s;ician with him, who feel|ing my Pul&s;e, told him I was in a Fever, but Bleeding he did not doubt would give me Ea&s;e. I told him I &s;hould be better in the Morning, if not, I would take his Advice. The Amba&s;&s;a|dor would have Mr. <HI>Villars,</HI> (as we had nam'd her) to Dinner with him, who had endeavour'd to compo&s;e her &s;elf while they had been in the Room. As &s;he was going from me, &s;he &s;queez'd my Hand, and &s;aid, Endeavour to com|po&s;e your &s;elf to Re&s;t, and you'll &s;oon be bet|ter.</P>
<P>They retir'd and left me to my own Thoughts, which were various and disjointed. Mrs. <HI>Vil|lars</HI> did not &s;tay long; &s;he came in &s;oftly as before, expecting that I might have been a&s;leep. When &s;he found I was in the &s;ame Di&s;order, &s;he bur&s;t into Tears, and cry'd, Will nothing &s;atisfy you but my Undoing? No Madam, &s;aid I, I will fight with my De&s;ires, and am re&s;olv'd to conquer or die. She &s;taid with me till Sup|per, and our whole Di&s;cour&s;e was upon the Pa&s;&s;ion of Love. When &s;he came back from
<PB N="111" REF="120">
Supper, I had got up and had dre&s;t my &s;elf; but the Combat in my Mind had really di&s;or|der'd my Body, which &s;he &s;oon &s;aw: She begg'd I would go to Bed again, and &s;he would watch me. I told her, the World &s;hould not pre|vail upon me to break her Re&s;t; nor even &s;he her &s;elf, who was more to me than the World. I had &s;at me down upon the Bed, and Mrs. <HI>Villars</HI> came and &s;at down by me. We remain'd &s;ilent a con&s;iderable time: at la&s;t &s;he took my Hands in hers, and pre&s;s'd me by the Fingers.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, I have overcome my &s;elf: I cannot &s;ee you in this Torture of Body and Mind, and not contribute to your Ea&s;e. Here &s;olemnly &s;wear to be my Husband, and do with me what you plea&s;e: I hope you are a Man of Honour, and that's what I rely upon. Nothing in this World could have tran&s;ported me &s;o much as tho&s;e few Words did: I fell upon my Knees, ki&s;s'd her Hands, and did I know not what! Madam, &s;aid I, you have made me the happie&s;t Man the World contains; and if I thought my Heart and Tongue did not agree in what I am going to &s;ay, I would pull 'em both out this Moment. When I had &s;aid this, I fell on my Knees, and made this &s;hort Vow. <HI>Thou God that know'&s;t the Heart of Man; I do be&s;eech Thee puni&s;h me with Eternity of Torments, if ever I prove fal&s;e to this Darling of my Soul, who before Thee I take (as the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing) to be my lawful Wife. And here I &s;wear</HI> (&s;aid &s;he, kneeling) <HI>to take no other to my Bed and Heart; and with this Ki&s;s,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>I &s;eal the &s;acred Union.</HI> I told her nothing could be more binding, and the Prie&s;t could but confirm what we had done al|ready.</P>
<P>Now the tender Moment was approaching to crown my Joys with all I wi&s;h'd on Earth,
<PB N="112" REF="121">
Kings on their Thrones to me &s;eem'd poor and ba&s;e, and I'd not have chang'd to be the Mo|narch of the Univer&s;e. I begg'd my dear Bride I might be her Bride-maid as well as Husband, and that &s;he would give me leave to undre&s;s her. Said &s;he, My Love, my Life, my Hu&s;|band, I am to obey you in every thing that's in my Power, and when I fail in my Obedi|ence, may I be mi&s;erable in the Lo&s;s of you. I was too eager to &s;ay any thing in Return, but I undre&s;s'd her, put her to Bed, and you may be &s;ure I did not &s;tay long behind. The Veil of Night was drawn round us, and I plung'd into a Sea of Plea&s;ures, too delicate for Words to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>The next Day, the Amba&s;&s;ador &s;aw Con|tentment in both our Faces, and congratu|lated me for the Recovery of my Health. Never was there &s;o tender a Wife; and the longer I had the Happine&s;s of Enjoyment, the more my Love was rais'd. The next Day, the Amba&s;&s;ador was to have his fir&s;t Au|dience, and we were all to be in Readine&s;s by Seven in the Morning. I got up early, and dre&s;s'd my dear Wife in a new Suit of Clothes, on purpo&s;e for this Occa&s;ion. The Governour of <HI>Alca&s;&s;ar, Hamet addo Riffy,</HI> was to be our Ma|&s;ter of the Ceremonies, who attended us with &s;everal <HI>Moors</HI> of Quality, and a Troop of the King's Blacks, as Guards. We &s;et forward about eight a-clock, in this Order. 1. Twelve of the <HI>Moor</HI> Guards. 2. Several of the Nobility, two by two. 3. The Amba&s;&s;ador, with <HI>Hamet addo Riffy</HI> on his Right Hand, preceded by two Trumpets and Kettle-Drums, (the Po&s;t of Ho|nour is on the Left among <HI>Moors,</HI> becau&s;e you have the Command of their Sword.) 4. Twen|ty-four Gentlemen of the Amba&s;&s;ador's Train,
<PB N="113" REF="122">
two by two. 5. Twelve <HI>French</HI> Slaves that car|ry'd the Pre&s;ents. 6. Twelve more of the Guards: And the Order was clos'd by a <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Mob, that abus'd us with their Tongues all they could; nay &s;ome of them attempted to throw Stones, but were ba&s;tinado'd by the Guards. We were all on Foot, though the King's Palace was a Mile from the Place where we &s;et out.</P>
<P>I was mightily concern'd at the Fatigue my dear Wife underwent, for it was violent hot; tho' we had the be&s;t on't, for going next the Amba&s;&s;ador (who order'd we &s;hould do &s;o) we had &s;ome Shelter from the Umbrella that was carried over his Head.</P>
<P>We enter'd the Palace through the Marble Gate, (&s;o call'd from two Marble Pillars that adorn it) and from thence, immur'd with white Walls and black Guards on each Side, we ar|riv'd at a &s;tately Pavilion; where a Halt was commanded 'till the King was acquainted with our Arrival. We waited &s;ome Time, but at la&s;t &s;aw him coming, mounted on a white Hor&s;e, through one of the Avenues that led to the Pavilion. His Guards (who had lin'd that Pa&s;|&s;age on each Side) bow'd down to the Ground as he pa&s;s'd along. He made but a very indif|ferent Appearance. A&s;&s;oon as he came to the Portico, he gave a Launce that he bore to one of his Guard, got from his Hor&s;e, and &s;quatted down upon the Floor without any thing under him. He had nothing in his Dre&s;s to be di|&s;tingui&s;h'd from the re&s;t of his Subjects, but was muffled up to the Eyes with a Chocolate|colour Handkerchief, that did not &s;eem over clean. His Legs and Arms were bare: As to his Age, he &s;eem'd to be about Fifty; of a ve|ry tawny Complexion, and very lean; his Hair black, inclining to grey; of a middle Stature,
<PB N="114" REF="123">
with hollow Cheeks, and Eyes black, a &s;mall hook'd No&s;e, and thick Lips. Some of his Courtiers &s;at down on each Side of him, bare|legg'd and bare-headed; and behind him &s;tood a Black with a great Fan in his Hand, not only to cool him, but to keep off the Muskito's, a &s;mall Fly, very trouble&s;ome in mo&s;t Parts of <HI>A|frica.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mahumet ben Addo Otar,</HI> his chief Mini&s;ter and Favourite, was the only Per&s;on that &s;tood.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as the Emperor had &s;quatted down on the Floor, he repeated the&s;e Words in <HI>Arabic</HI> three times, <HI>Tay buon,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>You are welcome;</HI> a common Expre&s;&s;ion when they are addre&s;s'd to by a Foreigner. Then our Amba&s;&s;ador made a long Speech in <HI>French,</HI> prepar'd for that Purpo&s;e; which was only a Panegyric upon both Kings, ful&s;ome e|nough; but the <HI>French</HI> deal much in wordy Compliments. The Interpreter, when the Am|ba&s;&s;ador had done, read the &s;ame in <HI>Arabic</HI> to the Emperor. The Speech was very long in <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Arabic,</HI> but the Emperor heard it out patiently, which was reckon'd a good O|men; he al&s;o excus'd him&s;elf that he did not admit him &s;ooner to his Audience, it being their <HI>Ramadan,</HI> or <HI>Ea&s;ter.</HI> When the Compli|ments were over, the Amba&s;&s;ador pre&s;ented all his Retinue to the Emperor, but I ob&s;erv'd he took a particular Notice of my Wife, and ey'd her &s;everal times, which gave me a great deal of Unea&s;ine&s;s; for it is as dangerous to be a hand&s;ome Man as a hand&s;ome Woman in <HI>Mo|rocco,</HI> if the Brute of an Emperor &s;hould have a Fancy for 'em.</P>
<P>I long'd to have an end of our Audience.</P>
<P>After we were pre&s;ented, the Amba&s;&s;ador or|der'd his Pre&s;ents to be open'd and &s;pread before
<PB N="115" REF="124">
the Emperor; which con&s;i&s;ted of fine Arms made at <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Watches and Cloth, two <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Carpets, and two Pieces of Gold and Silver Brocade. The Emperor, in return, gave the Amba&s;&s;ador four young Slaves, three of 'em <HI>French,</HI> (tho' he took 'em all for the &s;ame Nation) but the other was an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and the &s;ame Per&s;on I mentioned in the Beginning of this Relation, who went in the &s;ame Boat on Board of the <HI>Succe&s;s.</HI> I was very much confoun|ded at &s;eeing him, well knowing he was on Board when I fell out of the Ship. I long'd for an Opportunity to confer with him, tho' I could not perceive by his Looks that he knew me; but that might be from my Change of Habit, and the Sun's tarni&s;hing my Complexi|on.</P>
<P>The Emperor ro&s;e, (when he had given the Slaves) mounted, and rode off; and we went home in the &s;ame Order as we came there; only the chief Mini&s;ter, <HI>Mahumet ben Addo Otar,</HI> accompany'd the Amba&s;&s;ador as far as the Mar|ble Gate. I inform'd my dear Wife, when we came to our Lodging, the Anxiety I was in when the Emperor ey'd her: She told me &s;he had made the &s;ame Ob&s;ervation with much Unea|&s;ine&s;s; for, &s;aid &s;he, I had not the Pre&s;ence of Mind, upon the In&s;tant, to imagine my &s;elf a Man. However, we both wi&s;h'd our &s;elves on Board, and the Emba&s;&s;y well over, and then we might make our&s;elves merry with our Fears.</P>
<P>The next Day our Fears were much encreas'd; for hearing a Noi&s;e in the Street, we went to look out to know the Rea&s;on, and di&s;cover'd <HI>Hamet,</HI> our <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Renegado, with &s;everal Pri&s;o|ners manacled. We &s;oon retir'd again, but learnt by other People, that they were going to the Emperor, that he might make his Choice. The
<PB N="116" REF="125">
Sight of him renew'd our Fears, as I &s;aid, and we re&s;olv'd immediately to get Leave to go on Board, for fear of &s;ome unlucky Turn of For|tune.</P>
<P>I upon the In&s;tant went to wait on the Amba&s;|&s;ador, and declar'd to him what I had &s;een, begging Leave at the &s;ame time we might be &s;uffer'd to go on Board. He told me he would comply with my Reque&s;t for Mr. <HI>Villars</HI> and the <HI>Italian,</HI> but begg'd it as a Favour that I would &s;tay with him, for he &s;hould have great need of my A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; and if any thing &s;hould fall out, he would engage for my Liberty. Though the Reque&s;t cut me to the Heart, yet it was neither Pru|dence nor good Manners to refu&s;e him. I gave him my Promi&s;e to obey his Commands, but begg'd he would not in&s;i&s;t upon my going abroad but as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible. I went to my Wife, (my Readers, perhaps, may &s;mile at my calling her <HI>Wife,</HI> but I will a&s;&s;ure 'em we thought our &s;elves as much marry'd, as if the Par&s;on had execu|ted his holy Function; neverthele&s;s we did not intend to neglect that Ceremony the very fir&s;t Opportunity) and told her the Amba&s;&s;ador's Re|que&s;t, and my Promi&s;e. She agreed with me in the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of it, but yet could not forbear &s;hedding Floods of Tears at our (we hop'd) &s;hort Separation. The next Day was de&s;ign'd for their Journey; but the en&s;uing Night was &s;pent with Sighs, Tears, and a Low|ne&s;s of Spirit that look'd ominous. Yet we parted; and for &s;everal Hours I could not bring my Mind to any peaceable Form to wait on the Amba&s;&s;ador: But he &s;ent for me at la&s;t, and told me the Rea&s;on of his de&s;iring me to con|tinue with him was this:&mdash;</P>
<P>The King his Ma&s;ter had commanded him to make &s;ome Ob&s;ervation of the Cu&s;toms and
<PB N="117" REF="126">
Manners of this Part of <HI>Africa;</HI> and, added he, I have ob&s;erved in you a Capacity fit to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in the De&s;ign. I told him he might com|mand me in any thing that lay in my Power, and that I took it for an Honour he would think me worth his Employment.</P>
<P>We had Notice the next Day from the Per|&s;on that attended my Wife with the Camels, that he &s;aw them &s;afe on board, which gave me &s;ome Comfort. I begg'd the Amba&s;&s;ador to give me Leave to &s;peak a Word or two with one of the Slaves that the Emperor gave him. He order'd him to come before him, where I de&s;ir'd he would tell me how he came into the Hands of the <HI>Moors.</HI> He was prodigiou&s;ly &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee me there, and could hardly believe his Eyes; for it was thought by every Body that I had ei|ther been kill'd or drown'd; as indeed it was very improbable to think otherwi&s;e. He in|form'd us, that three Days after the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> par|ted with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of War, another <HI>Al|gerine</HI> Rover met with them, and took 'em af|ter an ob&s;tinate Fight; the Captain and &s;everal others being &s;lain in the Battle. It was his good Fortune to be bought for the Emperor's U&s;e; I call it good Fortune, &s;aid he, becau&s;e I was pre&s;ented to the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, and am now in Hopes of my Freedom.</P>
<P>I told the Amba&s;&s;ador in <HI>French</HI> what he &s;aid; and he was pleas'd to &s;ay, that to oblige me he would take him into his Protection. I re|member'd <HI>Mahumet ben Addo Otar</HI> was Amba&s;&s;a|dor in <HI>England;</HI> He came to vi&s;it the Amba&s;&s;a|dor often, and under&s;tanding <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I gather'd &s;everal good Hints for his De&s;ign; for he was courteous enough, though an Enemy in his Heart to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>

<P>His unexpected Death in 1672 gave room for many of his Family to rai&s;e Rebellion in their &s;everal Provinces: But <HI>Muley I&s;mael</HI> being the greate&s;t Favourite of the People, and of an en|terpri&s;ing Temper, proclaim'd him&s;elf King of <HI>Taphilet,</HI> and &s;eiz'd his Brother's Trea&s;ures, which are the Sinews of War. His Nephew, <HI>Muley Hamet,</HI> gave him the mo&s;t Trouble; for he had gain'd a Party, and declar'd him&s;elf King of <HI>Sus</HI> and <HI>Morocco,</HI> had &s;everal Battels, but at la&s;t was overcome as well as the re&s;t, and <HI>I&s;ma|el</HI> was &s;ettled the peaceful King of <HI>Taphilet, Morocco,</HI> and <HI>Fez.</HI> I have given a De&s;cription of his Per&s;on already. His Empire &s;preads from North to South four hundred Leagues, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t upwards of a hundred and fifty.</P>
<P>There are three &s;trong Places po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Europeans</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Afric.</HI> Fir&s;t <HI>Maga|zan</HI> on the Ocean, by the <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> and on the <HI>Mediterranean, Meli&s;&s;a</HI> and <HI>Ceuta</HI> by the <HI>Spa|niards.</HI> They had two more &s;trong Holds, <HI>La|rache,</HI> and <HI>Mammora;</HI> but the pre&s;ent Emperor drove them out &s;hamefully.

The Emperor has but nine Sea-Ports in his whole Dominions, viz. <HI>Sancta Cruz, Safy, Sallee, Mammora, Larache, Arzilla,</HI> and <HI>Tangier,</HI> on the <HI>A|fric</HI> Ocean; <HI>Zaffarina</HI> and <HI>Tetuan</HI> on the <HI>Medi|terranean;</HI> though <HI>Tetuan</HI> is two Leagues with|in Land. To begin in Order as they are nam'd; <HI>Sancta Cruz</HI> (or the <HI>Holy Cro&s;s)</HI> is the fir&s;t Port to the Southward. The Town is about a Mile in Length, and a Quarter broad. The chief Merchants are <HI>Jews,</HI> who trade with <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> Their Vent is Hides, Dates, Cop|per, and Bees-wax.</P>
<P><HI>Safy,</HI> or <HI>Sophia,</HI> appears next, a Town &s;itua|ted on a Hill; but drives a larger Trade than <HI>Sancta Cruz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sallee,</HI> &s;ituated 35 Leagues S. W. of <HI>Cape Spartel.</HI> It is divided into two Towns, the old and the new; (it is called by the Natives <HI>Ar|bat.)</HI> There's a very good Harbour, and a &s;trong Ca&s;tle well &s;tor'd with Guns, if the <HI>Moors</HI> knew how to make u&s;e of them. The Town is large, and well inhabited, but the Walls are all de|moli&s;h'd. I ob&s;erv'd the Ruins of a Church, the Steeple yet &s;tanding, a noble fine <HI>Gothic</HI> Building. The chief Trade of this Town con|&s;i&s;ts in the Prizes that are brought in by their Gallies.</P>
<P>About &s;even Leagues more to the North &s;tands <HI>Mammora,</HI> once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Spani|ards.</HI> It &s;tands in a Bottom &s;urrounded with Mountains, which renders the Air very un|whol&s;ome, by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive Heat; but the Bay is fine, large, and &s;ecure from all Winds. This Town is generally the high Road to <HI>Mequinez,</HI> the pre&s;ent Capital of <HI>Morocco.</HI></P>
<P>The next Port Northward is <HI>Larache,</HI> a Town of a plea&s;ant Situation, and &s;trongly fortified; but, to the eternal Infamy of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> de|liver'd
<PB N="120" REF="129">
up to <HI>I&s;mael</HI> after a Siege of five Moons; two thou&s;and Soldiers and a hundred Officers taken Pri&s;oners: a &s;ufficient Force to have de|fended it again&s;t the whole Powers of <HI>Muley I&s;mael,</HI> for they neither wanted Provi&s;ions nor Ammunition. But we &s;hall leave them and their Cowardice, and go on to</P>
<P><HI>Arzilla,</HI> or <HI>Azilath,</HI> about twelve Leagues more North. A Place only fam'd for Tobac|co, which they &s;eldom trade abroad for, having &s;ufficient Vent for it among the Natives of <HI>Morocco;</HI> and as we have but little Bu&s;ine&s;s with it, we'll come to</P>
<P><HI>Tangier</HI> as fa&s;t as we can, a fine, large, well|fortified City, when in the Hands of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h;</HI> but &s;ince they have left it, and raz'd the Fortifications, the <HI>Moors</HI> have not thought fit to repair it.</P>
<P>The next, <HI>Zaffarina,</HI> is a Place of very little Note, and therefore we &s;hall make no Ob&s;er|vation concerning it.</P>
<P>The la&s;t is <HI>Tetuan,</HI> a Town &s;ix Miles with|in Land, without any Fortification. The In|habitans came originally from the Province of <HI>Andalu&s;ia</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> as indeed did mo&s;t of the <HI>Moors</HI> on the Sea-Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africa.</HI> They are white Men, pretty well civiliz'd, very kind to Strangers and Chri&s;tians, and pay but little Re|gard to the Emperor of <HI>Morocco.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Nature of the Inhabitants, they are mo&s;t of a tawny Complexion, of a lazy, idle Di&s;po&s;ition, and curs'd with all the Vices of Mankind; mi&s;tru&s;tful to the la&s;t Degree, fal&s;e, jealous, and the very Picture of Ignorance. They &s;tyle them&s;elves <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmen,</HI> or true Believers, yet their Word is not to be rely'd upon on any Occa&s;ion. The <HI>Moors</HI> are generally but in|different Soldiers, and but &s;eldom brave. They
<PB N="121" REF="130">
are often fam'd in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tories for Men of Gallantry, but I could never find them in|clin'd that way. They manage a Hor&s;e, it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, with a great deal of Dexterity. They abominate the Chri&s;tians, for the very Word &s;ignifies in their Language, <HI>Dog;</HI> and are continually &s;eeking Means to de&s;troy them. <HI>Mahomet</HI> has taught 'em in his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> that all of his Faith who dye fighting again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, immediately enter into Paradi&s;e in Triumph; nay, even their Hor&s;es, if they did in Battle, are immediately tran&s;lated into Hea|ven; for they hope to have the Plea&s;ure of Riding there, as well as on Earth.</P>
<P>Though Poligamy is allow'd, yet they mu&s;t marry but four Wives, and mu&s;t &s;ettle a Dow|ry upon them; and if they ever put 'em away, they mu&s;t return their Dowry along with 'em: But they may keep as many Concubines as they think fit; tho' they have this Privilege, when they can plea&s;e 'em no longer, they &s;ell 'em to the be&s;t Bidder; &s;o that the Women of <HI>Morocco,</HI> in my Opinion, have but a &s;ad Time on't: yet the Husband is oblig'd to keep all their Children. They e&s;teem Ideots and Naturals to be Saints, if they are Men; for they believe the Women have no Souls, and are only form'd for Propagation. They will not allow 'em to enter their Mo&s;ques, becau&s;e they e&s;teem 'em unca|pable of being receiv'd into Heaven: Yet they &s;ay their Prayers at home, and on <HI>Fridays</HI> re&s;ort to the Places of Burial, to weep over the Graves of their deceas'd Friends, cloath'd in Blue, which is their Mourning. They hire profe&s;s'd Mour|ners to grieve and cry at the Graves of Rela|tions, and howl over them, as I have heard the <HI>Iri&s;h;</HI> asking them why they would die when they were provided with every thing that was
<PB N="122" REF="131">
nece&s;&s;ary in this World. Their Time is &s;pent in Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, Dallying with their Women, Hor&s;es, and Prayers (for they never learn to read, and are forbid Gaming) and even their Prayers are hurried over &s;o &s;lothful|ly, as if they were a&s;leep.</P>
<P>They have u&s;ually a String of Beads in their Hands, like the <HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> and to every Bead they have a &s;hort Prayer, which as they repeat, they drop through their Fingers. The Prayer con&s;i&s;ts only in the different Attributes of God, as, <HI>God is great, God is good, God is in|finite, God is merciful.</HI> The Emperor of the&s;e Wretches only differs from his Subjects in a lar|ger Propen&s;ity to their ill Qualities, with the Addition of a degree of Cruelty and Avarice. I was told, that during his twenty Years Reign he had murder'd with his own Hands twenty three thou&s;and Men: Nay I am apt to believe the Truth of it, for he put forty &s;even to Death in the one and twenty Days we were at his Court.</P>
<P>Every Nation is amaz'd to find his Subjects &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and patient under &s;o exce&s;&s;ive and cruel a Tyranny: But they &s;hould under&s;tand (bating their Want of Power) that they are taught to believe, if they fall by the Hand of a King who is a <HI>Xerif,</HI> (which &s;ignifies <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Suc|ce&s;&s;or) they immediately go up to Heaven; and if there is any that would not willingly be &s;ent to Heaven before their Time, they are &s;ure to fly him when he is cloath'd in Yellow, which is his Colour of Murder; and he generally dyes it of a Blood-colour before he goes to Sleep.</P>
<P>As I was viewing &s;ome new Buildings one Day, near the King's Palace, I perceiv'd him giving Directions to &s;ome of the Workmen. There were &s;everal Carts drove by his Slaves
<PB N="123" REF="132">
with Materials for his Building; and as they pa&s;s'd him, he ba&s;tinado'd &s;ome for going too fa&s;t, while others, thinking to mend that Fault, were drubb'd by him for going too &s;low; one poor Creature, trembling for fear of what would follow, went bowing before his Cart; but the Em|peror wounding the Hor&s;e in the Flank, he gave a Spring, tumbled the Wretch down, and drove over him. Another following him, ran to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Fellow, but the Emperor threw his Dart, and &s;truck him in the Shoulder. The Slave drew it out, and upon his Knees pre&s;ented it to him again, which the Emperor (when the Man had got &s;ome Di&s;tance from him) darted into his Chine. The Fool drew it out once more, and, cover'd with Blood, gave it to him back again; but as he was &s;tooping, he fell down with lo&s;s of Blood at the Barbarian's Feet, who did him the Favour to pin him to the Earth through his Back.</P>
<P>I was &s;o &s;hock'd at the Sight, that I could not recover my &s;elf for a good while afterwards. I thought the poor Fellow was a Fool; for if it had been my own Ca&s;e, I would have return'd it through his Body the fir&s;t Time, for he was &s;ure of Dying, and I think it would have been &s;ome Satisfaction to have &s;ent the Author of my Death the &s;ame Journey.</P>
<P>This King us'd to murder his Slaves upon the lea&s;t Complaint from the <HI>Moors,</HI> which they would make out of hatred to Chri&s;tians. But the Wretch finding his Slaves decrea&s;e too much, took another Method; and when the next Com|plaint was made, he killed the Slave, the Per&s;on complain'd again&s;t, but order'd the Complainant immediately to pay him double the Price he co&s;t him, or find him two more Slaves in his Room that In&s;tant, which he was oblig'd to do; but
<PB N="124" REF="133">
this Proceeding &s;topt their Mouths for the future.</P>
<P>They &s;ay he has a great deal of Wit and Courage, is very active, and expert in riding, and hurling the Dart. He drinks no Wine, becau&s;e his Religion forbids it: but when he takes Opi|um, or drinks a certain Mixture that he makes him&s;elf, compounded with Brandy, Cinamon, Cloves, Anni&s;eed, and Nutmegs, woe be to him that comes in his Way. He's much addicted to Women, having no le&s;s than four hundred Concu|bines. He has one hundred and eighteen Male Chil|dren alive, and about two hundred Females. One of the Males whom he de&s;igns for his Succe&s;&s;or, (and which he had by a Black, who advi&s;es him in every thing, and is reckon'd a politic Woman) he has named <HI>Muley Zeyden.</HI> His Revenue con&s;i&s;ts in Pre&s;ents from the Governors of his Provinces, and the <HI>Arabians</HI> who live in Huts about his Domi|nions. When he has a mind to &s;queeze, he &s;ends for a Governor from his Province, who knows well enough what he is &s;ent to for, and there|fore provides accordingly; &s;o that the Emperor fleeces the Governors, and they fleece the People. So that there is no one rich but him&s;elf, and yet he does not know what U&s;e to put his Trea&s;ure to, but hides it in &s;ecret Places; and the Per&s;on that a&s;&s;i&s;ts him in the Concealment is &s;ure to lo&s;e his Life for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Mequinez,</HI> the Capital, and the Place of his Re&s;idence, was formerly but a &s;mall Village, but now it contains &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Inhabi|tants, and the Streets are &s;o crowded, there's hardly any pa&s;&s;ing along. It is but a mean City, very ill built; and, if there falls any Rain, the dirtie&s;t Place I ever &s;et my Foot in; for there is no Pavement in the Streets; and when it is dry the Du&s;t is ready to choak one. The King's
<PB N="125" REF="134">
Palace is indeed a very large Place, almo&s;t four Miles round, including his Gardens; but it is very ill contriv'd. Here you &s;hall &s;ee a fine Pillar ad|ded to &s;upport an old ruinated Place, and yet he employs mo&s;t of his Time in Building. In &s;hort, it looks like gold Lace upon a Hop-&s;ack.</P>
<P>His Stables are the mo&s;t regular Building in all his Palace. But that's no wonder, for the <HI>Moors</HI> even reverence Hor&s;es; and one that has been a Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecca,</HI> has as much Veneration as the Pilgrim him&s;elf. The King had one of the&s;e Hor&s;es, which I have &s;een always finely capa|ri&s;on'd, and a Slave to attend, who carry'd a Pot and a Cloth to keep him Clean. All the Hor&s;es that are thus &s;anctify'd are u&s;ually freed from all manner of Service, and if the Owner cannot afford to keep it, which often happens, there is a Pen&s;ion &s;ettled upon 'em by the <HI>Mufty.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> drive a great Trade here, but they pay &s;ufficiently for that Privilege; for they are oblig'd to wear black Caps, that they may be di|&s;tingui&s;h'd; and notwith&s;tanding their great Trade, they are but &s;curvily us'd, for if a Child in&s;ults 'em, it is as much as their Lives are worth to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The Women of <HI>Morocco,</HI> I mean all that I had the Fortune to &s;ee, were very hand&s;ome, fine large full Eyes, round Faces, and every Fea|ture exact. They are very amorous, and dexte|rous in contriving Methods to &s;atisfie their De|&s;ires.</P>
<P>A Gentleman of our Retinue told me, he had got an Intrigue with one of the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Wo|men, Daughter to a Governor of a Province; and his manner of going to the Appointment was in Di&s;gui&s;e. She &s;ent him by a <HI>French</HI> Slave of hers a complete Woman's Dre&s;s, which are
<PB N="126" REF="135">
generally all alike; and their Faces are all muffled up to their Eyes, &s;o that they are often met by their own&punc; Husbands in the Street, without be|ing known; by this Dre&s;s he got Admittance as a Lady coming to pay a Vi&s;it, and then they are very &s;ecure. For it is the Cu&s;tom, when|ever a Man, even the Husband, finds a pair of Women's Sandals, at the Door of his Wife's Chamber, he mu&s;t retire; for it is the greate&s;t Affront they can put on a Woman, to enter her Apart|ment when they have that Warning to the con|trary. He told me &s;he was a delicious Creature, and Mi&s;tre&s;s of the whole Art of Love. It is no wonder if they give them&s;elves up to Love, when perhaps there are twenty, or more, (ac|cording to the Capacity of the Per&s;on that keeps 'em) Sharers in one &s;ingle Man; and they mu&s;t be contented to &s;tay for due Benevolence, till their Tyrant plea&s;es to &s;end for 'em.</P>
<P>The Habit of the Men is generally White, (which is a Colour they extreamly delight in) with a red Cap on their Heads; that is the mar|ried Men; for all the Youth, from the Prince to the Beggar, before Wedlock, go uncover'd. They are clo&s;e &s;hav'd under their Caps, except|ing one Lock upon the Crown of their Heads, which they never cut off; being they are taught, by that Lock, <HI>Mahomet</HI> is to draw 'em up to their imaginary Paradi&s;e. They only &s;have under their Chins, but &s;uffer their Beards and Mu&s;ta|choes to grow, which they take a particular Pride in the Length or Largene&s;s of; and he that's well bearded, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be a wi&s;e Man.</P>
<P>Their Shirts are made like Shifts, only the Sleeves are &s;o long that they hang down over their Hands. Under the Shirt they were linen Drawers, that reach down to their Knees, for their Legs are always bare; their Shoes are made
<PB N="127" REF="136">
without Heels, like <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Brogues. Over the Shirt is a Ve&s;t without Sleeves, which they &s;ur|round with a &s;ilk Scarf, of what Colour they plea&s;e (except Green, which is a Colour &s;acred to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> their Emperor, and the Clergy;) in this they thru&s;t &s;hort Daggers, or Knives. Over all, is a Garment, which they call a <HI>Hayick,</HI> about five Ells long, and four broad, which they wrap round 'em, as we do our Cloaks. Some of the meaner Sort, e&s;pecially in the Country, wear Straw-hats of their own Make. Their Dre&s;&s;es are all a-like, only &s;ome add a gold or &s;ilver Fringe round the Border.</P>
<P>As for Religion, they ri&s;e early and late to Prayers; but only like Children, do it becau&s;e they are order'd. Their <HI>Mufti,</HI> or Head of their Religion, is reckon'd the fir&s;t in the Empire, and di&s;owns the Emperor's Authority; but yet he finds means to fleece him, as well as the re&s;t of his Subjects, who obey him out of Fear; for if there was one Per&s;on found to love him, it would be as &s;trange a Sight as one of their Mon|&s;ters.</P>
<P>I could not forbear &s;miling to &s;ee the Providence of the <HI>Moors.</HI> Walking one Day about a Mile from <HI>Mequinez,</HI> it began to rain prodigiou&s;ly; I got under a Tree to &s;helter my &s;elf from the Tempe&s;t. But I ob&s;erv'd &s;everal of the Natives undre&s;s them|&s;elves with a great deal of Precipitation, make up their Cloaths in a Bundle, and &s;it on 'em &s;tark naked; and all their Care was to keep 'em from the Wet, leaving their naked Bodies expos'd to the Fury of the Storm. When it ceas'd, they walk'd a little Way till their Bodies were dry, and then dre&s;s'd them&s;elves. If a Man were to do &s;o in <HI>England,</HI> he would be counted a Madman, or a Fool, yet I mu&s;t own I thought 'em in the right; for be the Storm ever &s;o vio|lent,
<PB N="128" REF="137">
yet when it's over, they pur&s;ue their Jour|ney with dry Cloaths on their Backs. But they have one Conveniency, they are dre&s;t and un|dre&s;t in half a Minute. Nay, I am inform'd, tho&s;e that travel on Camels, or on Hor&s;eback, have a Conveniency cover'd with an oyl'd Cloth, in which they thru&s;t their Cloaths on the like Occa&s;ion, and ride naked. I fancy, to meet an Army in a Storm would create a terrible Fright, and do as much Execution to an Ignorant Body, as their offen&s;ive Arms, and force 'em to &s;eek for Safety in their Heels.</P>
<P>The Emperor is able to rai&s;e an hundred thou|&s;and Hor&s;e, and fifty thou&s;and Foot. When they are to make War among them&s;elves, they go very unwillingly into the Field; but when they op|po&s;e the Chri&s;tians, they do it with a great deal of Chearfulne&s;s; becau&s;e they expect Indulgences for the Expiation of their Sins. When they are ready to give Battle, they range their Armies after this Manner. They divide their Hor&s;e in|to two Bodies, and place one at each Wing, the Foot is in the Middle, &s;o that the whole forms a Cre&s;cent or half Moon. Before they begin the Battle, they give a great Shout, then make a &s;hort Prayer, and fall on without much Order very furiou&s;ly; &s;o that they &s;oon o|vercome, or are as &s;oon put to flight. Break but their foremo&s;t Ranks, and you put their whole Body into Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid before, that no Per&s;on is rich but the Emperor; neither do they take the Methods to be &s;o; or if they are, their greate&s;t Wi&s;dom will be to conceal it; for if once known, they are &s;ure to lo&s;e all their Wealth.</P>
<P>No Foreign Coin is currant in <HI>Morocco,</HI> ex|cept <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pieces of Eight, which are only receiv'd by Weight. But the <HI>Jews</HI> will &s;ecretly
<PB N="129" REF="138">
take any Coin, and I &s;uppo&s;e di&s;po&s;e of it again with the &s;ame Circum&s;pection they receive it. They have but three &s;orts of Coin currant a|mong 'em. The fir&s;t a <HI>Ducat,</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> Gold. Second a <HI>Blanquile,</HI> of <HI>Silver.</HI> And la&s;t a <HI>Felowze,</HI> of Copper. The Image of the Emperor is not allow'd to be put on their Money, being expre&s;ly forbid by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> in his <HI>Alcoran;</HI> but they &s;tamp 'em with <HI>Arabian</HI> Characters. Their way of reckoning is by the Ounce.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the Heads of what I ob&s;erv'd in my &s;mall Stay among 'em. The Amba&s;&s;ador in|form'd me, he was in &s;ome fear that his Emba&s;&s;y would not &s;ucceed; for he &s;aid, he found little el&s;e but Delays, Excu&s;es, and nothing of Sin|cerity among 'em. We were inform'd, that the Emperor de&s;ign'd to go &s;peedily upon an Ex|pedition again&s;t the <HI>Moors</HI> of the Province of <HI>Oran,</HI> who had newly revolted, and put to Death their Governor for his Avarice; he having ex|torted from 'em va&s;t Sums of Money; and the In|habitants after his Death, cho&s;e one of their own Province to command 'em. This ha&s;ten'd our Am|ba&s;&s;ador in his Legation, to get an An&s;wer one way or other. But we were inform'd, the King de&s;ign'd to &s;et out the next Day upon his Expe|dition, and yet the Amba&s;&s;ador had not his Audience of Leave. This made him, and us, very unea&s;y; for we could not &s;tir from <HI>Mequi|nez,</HI> without the Emperor's expre&s;s Leave. But about &s;even in the Evening, the Amba&s;&s;ador had Orders to come and take his la&s;t Audience, which was the ninth of <HI>June</HI> 1693: We went in the &s;ame Manner, as we did at fir&s;t. But we were inform'd by our Interpreter, that the King was in a very ill Humour, and that he had but an Hour before kill'd two of his chief Blacks,
<PB N="130" REF="139">
by &s;tabbing 'em with a Dagger he continually wore at his Girdle.</P>
<P>We enter'd the Palace further than the fir&s;t Time, where we waited a full half Hour. At la&s;t the Emperor approach'd richly dre&s;t, and finely mounted upon a white <HI>Barbary;</HI> the Saddle and other Accoutrements wrought with Gold and precious Stones in &s;everal Places. He was this Day in his Yellow, or Fatal Ve&s;t, and &s;prinkled in many Places with the Blood of tho&s;e he had &s;lain; and I thought his Countenance had &s;omething more of Horror in't, than at our fir&s;t Audience. He had a Spear in his Hand, &s;et round with Pearls on the Top, and a Cap with E&s;triches Feathers waving in the Wind. All his Attendants had fled his Pre&s;ence, at the Notice of his having on his yellow Ve&s;t; and he had only about a dozen of his Guards wait|ing upon him trembling, but the <HI>Alcaydes</HI> and other great Men crept about us during our Au|dience.</P>
<P>The Emperor begun with his old Compli|ment of <HI>You're wellcome,</HI> but his Looks and his Words I thought did but ill agree. The Am|ba&s;&s;ador us'd many Arguments with him to bring his Emba&s;&s;y to a happy I&s;&s;ue, but to no Purpo&s;e. The Amba&s;&s;ador told me, the King was a Per|&s;on that had not the lea&s;t Regard to his Word, and even di&s;own'd a Letter he had written to his Ma&s;ter the King of <HI>France.</HI> Therefore, &s;aid he, we'll take our leave of this Country of Mon&s;ters in two Days: for the King had &s;ign'd his Depar|ture, with all his Retinue.</P>
<P>I was very well pleas'd with this his Re&s;olu|tion; for now I &s;hould once more &s;ee that Trea&s;ure of my Soul, who&s;e Ab&s;ence had robb'd me of all Joy. I even thought the&s;e two Days the
<PB N="131" REF="140">
longe&s;t of my Life; but at la&s;t they were pa&s;t, and we &s;et out very merrily; at lea&s;t I did, and all the re&s;t of the Retinue. Tho' I mu&s;t own I could not an|&s;wer for the Amba&s;&s;ador, for I believe the ill Succe&s;s of his Emba&s;&s;y had a little chagrin'd him. I did my utmo&s;t Endeavour to divert his Melan|choly upon the Road, which he took very kindly. We lay in Tents the fir&s;t Night, which the Amba&s;&s;ador had taken care to provide us, and Provi&s;ion likewi&s;e; for there is never an Inn between <HI>Mequinez</HI> and <HI>Mammora.</HI></P>
<P>We ro&s;e the next Day very early, that we might avoid the Heat of the Sun. When we came within a League of the Town, we &s;aw coming towards us our <HI>Italian,</HI> and by the Me|lancholy in his Looks, I began to tremble with Apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome Accident. A&s;&s;oon as he approach'd us, after paying his Obedience to the Amba&s;&s;ador, he addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to me. Said he, in <HI>French,</HI></P>
<P>I wi&s;h &s;ome one el&s;e would have taken my Commi&s;&s;ion upon 'em, for what I have to tell you will cut you to the Heart. The various Troubles in my Brea&s;t lock'd up my Tongue, &s;o that I had not Power to ask him any Que|&s;tions. In &s;hort, &s;aid he, your Mi&s;tre&s;s is forc'd away from us, through the Treachery of <HI>Mu&s;ta|pha.</HI> At hearing this fatal News, I drop'd &s;en&s;e|le&s;s from my <HI>Camel,</HI> nor came to my &s;elf till we arriv'd at <HI>Mammora.</HI> I was a thou&s;and times going to de&s;troy my &s;elf; and I believe I had done it in the height of my De&s;pair, if I had not been withheld. In &s;hort, the Amba&s;&s;ador was no longer ignorant of my cruel Lo&s;s: For in my Ravings, I had call'd her my dear Wife. He &s;eem'd amaz'd at the Di&s;covery, and re|proach'd me in a hand&s;ome Manner, for not tru&s;ting him with the Secret. I was not in a
<PB N="132" REF="141">
Condition to beg his Pardon, neither was there any one could give me Comfort. I was carry'd on Board, where I enquir'd in what manner &s;he was taken away.</P>
<P>The Captain inform'd us, that <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> had made his E&s;cape out of the Cabin Window, by &s;wimming. I did not tell any one of it, &s;aid the Captain, becau&s;e I thought it would be to no Purpo&s;e; for I imagin'd there could be no o|ther ill Con&s;equence to attend his E&s;cape, but meerly the Lo&s;s of him. He had been gone three Days, when on the fourth there came on board us the Governor of <HI>Mammora,</HI> the Fugitive <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> and one hundred Soldiers, who imme|diately &s;eiz'd on the young Gentleman, whom they &s;aid was a Woman, and Wi&s;e to a Renegado of <HI>Sallee.</HI> It was in vain to oppo&s;e 'em, e&s;pecially when I found by her Brea&s;ts, that &s;he was really a Woman. They took her on Shore, notwith|flanding all her Cries, Shrieks and Lamentations, which pierc'd our very Hearts. They put her on board a <HI>Saick,</HI> and &s;et Sail immediately, &s;teer|ing South, as we &s;uppo&s;e for the Port of <HI>Sallee.</HI> This Gentleman, (meaning the <HI>Italian)</HI> took it upon him to acquaint you with the unhappy Accident; but, added he, I believe it is not po&s;&s;ible to regain her. The Amba&s;&s;ador was &s;o good as to offer his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in what lay in his Power. I begg'd he would be pleas'd to lend me a Boat, with &s;ome Hands to work her. He very willingly granted my Reque&s;t; and told me, he would lend me the Ship, but he fear'd it might occa&s;ion a more publick Quarrel.</P>
<P>He lent me ten Hands, four Patareros, and &s;ufficient &s;mall Arms, with every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary. My kind <HI>Italian</HI> would accompany me, and the re&s;t of the Company went Volun|tary. We &s;pent but little time in fitting out;
<PB N="133" REF="142">
and the Wind proving favourable, we &s;et Sail, and made very good Way. The <HI>Saick</HI> had not pur&s;u'd her Voyage above five Hours before us, &s;o that we had hopes of getting up with 'em. I en|courag'd my Companions, who labour'd ince&s;&s;antly. We &s;ail'd and row'd all Night, and when the Morning dawn'd, we gain'd Sight of a Ve&s;|&s;el, which we did not doubt was that we &s;ought for. We labour'd hard to come up with her, and gain'd upon her every Moment. Be|fore eight a-clock we came a long &s;ide of her, and I &s;oon di&s;cover'd <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> giving Orders about the Engagement. I drew out a pair of Pi&s;tols, and &s;hot him dead. The re&s;t fir'd upon us, but notwith&s;tanding all their Oppo&s;ition, I jump'd into their Ve&s;&s;el, follow'd by the <HI>Ita|lian</HI> and five more of the Men: And tho' they were &s;uperior in Number, yet we &s;oon made 'em ask for Quarter. I upon the In&s;tant enquir'd for her that was always in my Thoughts; but, to my great Grief, was inform'd by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Slave at the Oar, that &s;he was taken on board of a Galley by Captain <HI>Hamet,</HI> our <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Renegado; and they a&s;&s;ured me, it was impo&s;&s;ible for 'em to be overtaken. Un&s;peakable was the Sorrow I felt, at this Relation; and all the Satisfaction I felt was, that I had rewarded <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> for his Treachery. We &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e back, but I was more dead than alive in the Voyage.</P>
<P>When we came on Board, the Amba&s;&s;ador con|dol'd with me for my Misfortune, and entreated me to take Comfort. I told him Death was now my only Comfort, and I hop'd he was not far off.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Italian</HI> had agreed for his Pa&s;&s;age on board a Ve&s;&s;el in the Bay, bound for <HI>Rome:</HI> He begg'd that I would accompany him into <HI>Italy;</HI> and when he had &s;ettled his Affairs, he would (if it lay in his Power) come back to
<PB N="134" REF="143">
<HI>Sallee,</HI> and do his Endeavour to find what was become of Mrs. <HI>Villars.</HI> I thank'd him for his Offer, and told him I would accept of it. I had Effects enough, having all the Money and Jewels we brought from <HI>Hamet</HI>'s Country-Hou&s;e. We took leave of the Amba&s;&s;ador, and gave him abundance of Thanks for his Civilities, and went on board the Ve&s;&s;el that waited for us; we &s;et Sail immediately, and in two Months &s;afely ar|riv'd at <HI>Rome;</HI> where our <HI>Italian</HI> did not care to go publickly on Shore, but &s;tay'd till the Darkne&s;s of the Night favour'd our Landing.</P>
<P>We had all our Goods di&s;embark'd, and took a Private Lodging in an ob&s;cure Part of the City, where we were &s;ure of being conceal'd. We ask'd our Landlord, (who was a <HI>Frenchman)</HI> about the News of the Place. He told us a great deal of idle &s;tuff, which &s;ignify'd nothing to us; at la&s;t, by the Advice of the <HI>Italian,</HI> I enquir'd of him, if <HI>Hernando Alvares</HI> were in Town, or no? He an&s;wer'd me, that he had been dead above two Months, and had left a noble E&s;tate behind him. I ask'd him if he had not left a Wife to po&s;&s;e&s;s it. No, &s;aid he.</P>
<P>About three Years ago (continu'd our Landlord) he was to have been marry'd to a beautiful young Lady, an Heire&s;s to a va&s;t Fortune; but his Brother &s;tept in between, and gain'd her Affection. Some &s;ay they were marry'd, and others not; but &s;he was deliver'd of a fine Boy. Don <HI>Hernando</HI> took a barbarous Revenge of his Brother, as it is re|ported: He brib'd a Captain of a Ve&s;&s;el to put a Weight about his Neck, and drown him in the Sea. But to make amends for this inhuman Act, he has left his va&s;t E&s;tate to the Son his Brother had by the Lady, and has cho&s;en his Holine&s;s the <HI>Pope</HI> for his Guardian. Pray, &s;aid I, what's become of the young Lady? He an&s;wer'd me he
<PB N="135" REF="144">
could not tell; but it is &s;uppos'd &s;he was gone into a Nunnery.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italian,</HI> while our Di&s;cour&s;e la&s;ted, had turn'd his Face to the Window, that we might not perceive the Di&s;order of his Countenance. A&s;&s;oon as our Landlord was gone, he turn'd to me, and embrac'd me; &s;aid he, My dear Friend, let what will happen to me, I &s;hall have it in my Power to &s;erve you with my Fortune; and &s;o much I think my &s;elf obliged to you, that if half will buy your Mi&s;tre&s;s's Liberty, you &s;hall command it. I return'd him the Acknowledg|ments his kind Proffer de&s;erv'd, but told him, I could not expect to be &s;o happy. He bid me not de&s;pair. I begg'd he would not mention any thing of my Affairs, till his own came to a lucky I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The next Day, we procur'd our &s;elves Habits after the Mode of <HI>Rome,</HI> and re&s;olv'd to go to <HI>Grimaldi</HI>'s Country-Hou&s;e, to hear, if it were po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome Tidings of <HI>I&s;abella.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Antonio</HI> had dre&s;t him&s;elf in a mean Habit, and appear'd as my Servant. It being but &s;ix plea&s;ant Miles, we had re&s;olv'd to walk it. We enter'd a Village within half a Mile of the Place, and re&s;olv'd to dine at a poor Inn, there to gain &s;ome Intelligence. I went for a <HI>French</HI> Merchant, and Don <HI>Antonio</HI> pa&s;s'd (as I &s;aid) for my Servant, and Interpreter, and inform'd me of the Di&s;cour&s;e that pa&s;t between 'em. That Gentleman, (meaning me) &s;ays he to our Ho&s;t, has &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s to commu|nicate to Don <HI>Antonio Grimaldi,</HI> (for we knew of his being there). Our Innkeeper told us, it would be a difficult Matter to talk to him about Bu|&s;ine&s;s now, for he was that very Evening going to &s;et out with his Daughter, in order to put her into a Nunnery at <HI>Naples;</HI> for all his Per|&s;ua&s;ions (added he) cannot prevail upon her,

but &s;he is fixt unalterably in her Re&s;olution: This News, you may be &s;ure, ha&s;ten'd our De|parture; but we did not well know how to di&s;|clo&s;e the Secret we had to unfold.</P>
<P>Don <HI>Antonio,</HI> as not doubting <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Affecti|on to him, was fearful le&s;t an abrupt Di&s;covery &s;hould have &s;ome &s;trange Effect upon her: We therefore re&s;olv'd, that I &s;hould fir&s;t appear and break the Matter by degrees; for he had in|form'd me that &s;he &s;poke <HI>French</HI> very well. When we approach'd the Hou&s;e, <HI>Antonio</HI> &s;tood at &s;ome Di&s;tance, while I went up to the Door alone. The Porter and I not under&s;tanding one another, I had like to have return'd as wi&s;e as I came. But at la&s;t a Servant in the Family happening to under&s;tand <HI>French,</HI> came and ended our &s;putt'ring at one another. I inform'd him I had a Secret of the greate&s;t Importance to declare to <HI>Donna I&s;abella.</HI> He told me he would acquaint his Lord with it. The Servant went in, and immediately return'd with a grave old Gentle|man, that &s;eem'd to have been weeping. He ask'd me in <HI>French</HI> what I had to &s;ay to his Daughter, for &s;he did not care to &s;peak to any one. I begg'd that I might be brought to her Pre&s;ence, and did not doubt but that I had &s;omething to &s;ay to her which would not di&s;plea&s;e her. Don <HI>Antonio Grimaldi</HI> gravely &s;mill'd, and &s;hook his Head; No, no, Sir, &s;aid he; you have nothing to give either her or me Comfort, unle&s;s you could revive the Dead. I an&s;wered him, he did not know what I could do. But I told him, the longer he delay'd my &s;eeing her, the longer he deferr'd their own Happine&s;s. Well, &s;aid he, I have no Hopes; but you &s;hall &s;ee my Daughter, to convince you that nothing in this World can make us Happy.</P>

He led me through &s;everal &s;tately Apartments all hung with Black. And though it was high Noon, yet the Sun's Light was excluded, and dim twinkling Lamps u&s;urp'd his Room. At la&s;t we enter'd a Chamber, where &s;at the fair Forlorn. I &s;top'd a Moment to behold her, and notwith|&s;tanding a fixt Melancholy on her Countenance, Beauty triumph'd there. She was care&s;&s;ing an Infant &s;he had in her Arms. The Father enter'd fir&s;t, and told her in <HI>French,</HI> that a Gentleman of <HI>France</HI> had a Secret to communicate to her, that would bani&s;h her Melancholy. The Gen|tleman (return'd the Lady) may promi&s;e Impo&s;|&s;ibilities, but rather than expo&s;e him, I would beg him not to open his Mouth upon that Sub|ject. Madam, &s;aid I, I own my &s;elf a Phy&s;ici|an, but I pretend to cure the Mind as well as the Body; and to acquaint you with what you know already, you mourn the Lo&s;s of a Gentle|man, that you imagine was drown'd at Sea: But I can a&s;&s;ure you he e&s;cap'd that Danger, and is now a Captive in <HI>Barbary,</HI> pining under the &s;evere&s;t Want; and all the Hope he has of Free|dom, is through your Means.</P>
<P>The Lady upon this look'd wi&s;hfully upon her Father, and &s;aid, Dear Father, don't endea|vour to deceive me any longer; you know I have your Promi&s;e, and my Time's expir'd. My dear Child, I am amaz'd as much as you can be, return'd the Father; for by all that's Holy, I ne|ver &s;aw this Gentleman in my Life before, and am &s;o far from believing him, that (begging his Pardon) I fancy there mu&s;t be &s;ome very great Mi|&s;take in't. Upon this I related to them all his Story, from the beginning, to our meeting in <HI>Barbary.</HI></P>
<P>I found my Relation had &s;tagger'd her Faith a little, for a plea&s;ing Hope, rectify'd by power|ful
<PB N="138" REF="147">
Fear, ro&s;e in her beautiful Face; and &s;he threw her &s;elf at my Feet, notwith&s;tanding all my Endeavours to the contrary. Dear Sir, &s;aid &s;he, do not &s;how me this light of Comfort, to put it out, and plunge me into eternal Darkne&s;s. Madam, &s;aid I, by Heaven, and heavenly Pow|ers, I have &s;een him within the&s;e two Months, and what I have related to you, his own Mouth inform'd me; and having gain'd my Liberty, I made him a Promi&s;e to &s;ee his Friends in <HI>Italy,</HI> and inform them of his Condition. The Tran|&s;ports and Ec&s;ta&s;ies that took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of both their Souls cannot be expre&s;s'd by Words; they embrac'd me, ki&s;s'd me, call'd me their Pre|&s;erver. Unlook'd-for Happine&s;s! (&s;aid <HI>I&s;abella)</HI> Heaven, thou ha&s;t heard my Prayers! and does my dear <HI>Antonio</HI> live! I'll immediately imbark for <HI>Barbary,</HI> and fetch him thence my &s;elf: Even all that I am worth, my precious Boy &s;hall &s;ell his Fortune too, to redeem his Father. O my young <HI>Antonio,</HI> Heaven has re&s;tor'd thy Father from the Dead, (&s;aid &s;he to her Child) and I hope we &s;hall &s;ee him again. The pretty Innocent mingled his Tears of Joy with theirs. After their fir&s;t Tran&s;ports were over, they again embrac'd me, and begg'd I would put 'em in a way to pay me the Obligations they ow'd me. Then they pro|ceeded to enquire which way they mu&s;t go a|bout to accompli&s;h his Liberty. I told 'em, I had a Servant waiting without, that I intended &s;hould accompany the Per&s;ons they would &s;end to manage the Affair. They &s;eem'd to reproach me for letting him wait without, and were im|mediately &s;ending for him in. I begg'd they would give me leave to go for him my &s;elf, be|ing he was a Foreigner, and they would find it a hard matter to make him under&s;tand them. Upon this I ran out, and call'd to <HI>Antonio,</HI> and
<PB N="139" REF="148">
told him in few Words how things &s;tood. He follow'd me clo&s;e at the Heels: I went into the Room fir&s;t, and as <HI>Antonio Grimaldi</HI> was giving him his Hand to lead him in, he fell upon his Knees before him. <HI>I&s;abella</HI> ca&s;ting her Eyes up|on him, gave a Shriek, and cry'd out, 'Tis he! 'tis he him&s;elf! my dear <HI>Antonio!</HI> Joy took away her Speech, and &s;he fell down in a Trance. He ran and caught her in his Arms, ki&s;s'd and em|brac'd her, and at la&s;t brought her to her&s;elf. Ima|gination mu&s;t make up the Di&s;cour&s;e between 'em. He told her at la&s;t, when Words of Sen&s;e took Place, that he was obliged to me for his Liberty; for he had &s;ent &s;everal Letters to his Si&s;ters, but never could get any An&s;wer. They inform'd him, that both his Si&s;ters were gone to re&s;ide at <HI>Venice</HI> with their Husbands, and that was the Rea&s;on his Letters never came to their Hands. Now, &s;aid <HI>Antonio,</HI> if my Friend (meaning me) was but happy, it would compleat my Joy. But to find a Wife, a Son, and Father kind, when I had many Rea&s;ons to think the contrary, mu&s;t have &s;ome Alloy, or it would not be po&s;&s;ible for me to bear it.</P>
<P><HI>Antonio</HI> upon this related my unhappy Story, and they all lamented my hard Fortune. He af|terwards enquir'd of his dear <HI>I&s;abella</HI> concerning her own Sufferings. Which &s;he readily began.</P>
<P>Said &s;he, that Day you left me, the Troubles of my Mind wrought &s;o much upon my Body, that the Phy&s;icians declar'd I was in a violent Fever, and advis'd my Father to &s;end me into the Country, which he accordingly did the next Day. The Thoughts of being &s;o far from my dear <HI>Antonio</HI> encreas'd my Malady, and my Fa|ther had little Hopes of my Life. My Fever, after having brought me to the brink of the Grave, left me: And my Father imagining it was
<PB N="140" REF="149">
the approaching Marriage had wrought this &s;udden Illne&s;s, told me one Day, that if it was that which lay &s;o heavy upon my Spirits, he would remove it, by giving me the Power of refu&s;ing to be the Wife of <HI>Hernando Alvarez.</HI> I thank'd him, and told him he had taken the only way to re&s;tore my Health; and that if I was forc'd to wed him, I &s;hould be for ever mi&s;erable. He was the tendere&s;t of Fathers, and inform'd me he would never force my Inclinations. The Kind|ne&s;s my Father &s;hew'd me work'd &s;o much upon me, that I began to recover.</P>
<P>Your Brother us'd often to vi&s;it me in my Ill|ne&s;s, which retarded my Health. My Father &s;ee|ing it would never be in my Power to like him, very frankly told him &s;o, and begg'd that he would di&s;continue his Vi&s;its; for he was re&s;olv'd his Daughter &s;hould never give her Hand, where it was not in her Power to give her Heart. They parted with many Words between them, but my Father per&s;i&s;ted in his Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>I began to di&s;cover that I was with Child, and a new Sort of an Illne&s;s &s;eiz'd me. I knew this was an Accident that could not long be conceal'd, therefore I re&s;olv'd to let you know my Condition; and I gain'd my Woman, by &s;e|veral Promi&s;es of a Reward, to deliver a Letter to you: But &s;he betray'd me to your Brother, which I &s;u&s;pected from her not appearing. I there|fore declar'd the Truth to my indulgent Father. He was very much enrag'd at the Di&s;covery; but paternal Love prevailing over his Pa&s;&s;ion, he forgave me, and promis'd to make me happy with my dear <HI>Antonio.</HI> The&s;e Promi&s;es made my Sickne&s;s vani&s;h, and I had no other Di&s;|ea&s;e but what attends breeding Women. My Father went to <HI>Rome</HI> to enquire for <HI>Don An|tonio,</HI> but could not get the lea&s;t Information
<PB N="141" REF="150">
of him. This gave me a new Shock. But what bitter Agonies did I feel, when I receiv'd a Letter from your Brother, with a Copy of that I had written to you enclos'd; which was as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>UNgrateful Woman! Yet I will no more up|braid thee, but let thy Crime be thy Puni&s;h|ment. He that betray'd me I will not call by the Name of Brother: He has paid for his Ingratitude with his Life. I only give thee this Notice, that thou may'&s;t feel &s;ome of tho&s;e Pangs thou ha&s;t thru&s;t into the Brea&s;t of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Hernando Alvares.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The Reading of this Letter &s;unk me down, and I call'd for Death, as my la&s;t and only Hope. I re&s;olv'd to refu&s;e all Food, and had &s;tarv'd my &s;elf to Death, if a good Prie&s;t had not convinc'd me by his Arguments my Soul was in Danger, and I &s;hould be guilty of a double Murder, my &s;elf, and Infant. I lingred on in a re&s;tle&s;s State of Unhappine&s;s, till the Time of my Delivery came, which I pray'd to Heaven to end with my Life: But it pleas'd the Almighty Power to &s;pare me to be happy.</P>
<P>The Sight of my precious Infant call'd to Mind the Lo&s;s of his Father; but I re&s;olv'd to bani&s;h all Thoughts of Death, that I might take Care of his tender Years. But I begg'd my Father to give me leave to go into a Nun|nery. With much Importunity he granted my Reque&s;t, on this Condition, that if I continu|ed in that Mind at the End of two Years, I might do as I thought fit. Tho' I thought the Time an Age, yet I unwillingly con&s;ented.</P>
<P>My Father us'd Means with the <HI>Pope,</HI> to have your Brother call'd to an Account for
<PB N="142" REF="151">
your Death; and it had gone hard with him, if we could have procur'd any Witne&s;&s;es; but for Want of that he was acquitted. In a lit|le time a heavy and deep Melancholy &s;eiz'd him; and he profe&s;s'd &s;o &s;incere a Repentance, that even I almo&s;t forgave him. He begg'd he might &s;ee the Child; which my Father made me comply with. He &s;hed &s;uch abundance of Tears over it, that my Father wept for Com|pany; and &s;poke &s;o tenderly of the Lo&s;s of his Brother, that wip'd off all Su&s;picions of his Repentance. Since thou ha&s;t lo&s;t a Father, &s;aid he, through my Barbarity, it is but ju&s;t that I &s;hould prove a Father to thee. He fre|quently came to &s;ee him, though I could never be prevail'd upon to accept of a Vi&s;it. At la&s;t his Grief &s;eiz'd him &s;o violently, that he was given over by his Phy&s;icians. When he was upon his Death-Bed, he made his Will, and bequeath'd my little <HI>Antonio</HI> his whole E&s;tate; leaving the Pope his Guardian. He dy'd full of Repentance for his Crime, and no doubt his Soul took her Flight to Heaven.</P>
<P>The generous <HI>Antonio</HI> could not refu&s;e &s;ome Tears to the Memory of his repentant Brother; but Joy &s;ucceeded Sorrow. The <HI>Pope</HI> was ac|quainted with the Story, who &s;ent to congra|tulate their happy Meeting. Nothing but Mirth and Plea&s;ure ran through the <HI>Villa;</HI> which in|creas'd my Sorrow.</P>
<P><HI>Don Antonio</HI> told me one Day, that he did not think he had a Right to rejoice without me; and now, &s;aid he, I have nothing to afflict me but what you feel, therefore will bend my Thoughts if it be po&s;&s;ible to relieve your Grief. I can procure a Fryar of my Acquaintance to go to <HI>Sallee,</HI> one that knows the Nature of the Bu&s;ine&s;s we &s;hall &s;end him about, being he has
<PB N="143" REF="152">
often gone to redeem Captives: We'll &s;end for him, and you may give him what In&s;tructions you think fit. I thank'd him, and was very &s;orry for the Trouble I &s;hould give him, but was re&s;olv'd to accompany him my &s;elf. He told me he would not have me go by any means, for I could be of no manner of U&s;e in the Affair, but rather a Hindrance; and if I &s;hould be once di&s;covered, might fall into the &s;ame State we both lately e&s;cap'd from; and perhaps meet with much wor&s;e U&s;age than I had before. His Advice was &s;o rea&s;onable, that I re&s;olv'd to take it, whatever Vio|lence I did my &s;elf. The Fryar was &s;ent for, bad his Commi&s;&s;ion and In&s;tructions given him, and withal to &s;pare no Co&s;t. <HI>Antonio</HI> told him whatever he gave &s;hould not be thought unrea|&s;onable.</P>
<P>He was to have a thou&s;and Crowns for his Expences, and two thou&s;and more if he &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>The Fryar undertook his Voyage with a great deal of Alacrity, and gave us great Hopes of his Succe&s;s by his Willingne&s;s; and he em|bark'd the next Day for <HI>Genoa,</HI> that Port be|ing the propere&s;t Place to get a Ve&s;&s;el for <HI>Bar|bary.</HI> We wi&s;h'd him a good Voyage, and re|commended him to Fortune.</P>
<P><HI>Don Antonio</HI> did all he could to divert my Melancholy: We often went a hunting, &s;hoot|ing, fi&s;hing, and vi&s;iting the Ladies. In &s;hort, he made me partake in all the Diver&s;ions <HI>Ita|ly</HI> could afford. But though I &s;eem'd often to be diverted, yet I had always my Condition too much at Heart to be merry. We view'd all the Rarities and Antiquities of ancient and modern <HI>Rome.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the&s;e Amu&s;e|ments lull'd my Sorrows often, but when I had Time for Reflection they ru&s;h'd upon me with the greater Force.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="153">
I &s;hall not trouble my Reader in de&s;cri|bing Places treated on by Pens far above my weak Capacity; but only give a &s;hort De&s;cription of <HI>Naples,</HI> whither <HI>Don Antonio</HI> would have me go. I was not much aver&s;e to the Journey, though a pretty long one; and we &s;et out with a very hand&s;om Equipage. <HI>Donna I&s;abella,</HI> with her little Son, accompany'd us; but <HI>Don Antonio Grimaldi</HI> was oblig'd to attend the <HI>Pope,</HI> to &s;ettle the Affairs of his Son-in-law's E&s;tate. I was oblig'd to appear chearful, if it was but in Complai&s;ance to <HI>Don Antonio.</HI></P>
<P>We arriv'd at <HI>Naples</HI> in three Days, without meeting any thing extraordinary upon the Road. Certainly, never any City in the World can boa&s;t a finer Situation: Add to that, their Buil|dings are &s;umptuous, every private Hou&s;e &s;eems a Palace, and every Palace looks like the Court of a King: The Streets &s;pacious; a mild Air and free from Tempe&s;ts; &s;trong, both by Art and Nature. In &s;hort, if I was obliged to live out of my native Country, (which every Man is fond of) <HI>Naples</HI> &s;hould be the only Place. It has a Wall kept in very good Repair, with three Ca&s;tles almo&s;t impregnable. The chief is &s;eated on Mount <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> &s;o call'd from a Chappel dedicated to him: But if it is <HI>Era&s;mus Roterda|mus,</HI> I can't imagine how the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> came to have &s;uch a particular Regard for him, when it is very well known he was no great Friend to them; at lea&s;t he was a Scourge to their Ab&s;urdities in his Writings.</P>
<P>This is not only a Safeguard to the City and adjacent Country, but might prove its Scourge. In 1587 it was blown up by Light|ning, penetrating to the Powder Room, which mightily damag'd the whole City. The &s;econd
<PB N="145" REF="154">
is <HI>Ca&s;tello nuevo,</HI> or the new Ca&s;tle, built by <HI>Charles,</HI> King of <HI>Naples.</HI> This Ca&s;tle commands the Haven, and is generally the Viceroy's Dwel|ling. The third &s;tands on the South-ea&s;t Cor|ner of the City, built upon a little Rock, join'd to the Continent by <HI>Lucullus</HI> the <HI>Roman,</HI> and is &s;ometimes call'd by his Name, but oftner <HI>Ca|&s;tello del Ovo,</HI> or the Ca&s;tle of the Egg, from its Form. They have al&s;o a fine Ar&s;enal for their Gallies, very well kept, and furni&s;h'd with great Store of Ammunition. But I think the Mole the mo&s;t extraordinary Piece of Work, being it defends the Haven from the &s;tormy South; lin'd of each Side, and pav'd on the Top with noble &s;quare Stones, and in the mid|dle a fine large Fountain of Marble; the whole Extent is five hundred Paces, and ten in Breadth. The Inhabitants often boa&s;t of the Antiquity of their City, founded twenty years after <HI>Troy</HI>'s De&s;truction, and call'd by the antient Poets <HI>Par|thenope,</HI> which <HI>Virgil</HI> does &s;ufficiently te&s;tify in his <HI>Georgics,</HI>
<Q><L>Ille Virgilium me Tempore dulcis alebat</L>
<L><HI>Parthenope,</HI> &s;tudiis florentem ignobilis ot&icirc;.</L></Q></P>
<P>This City has &s;uffer'd many Revolutions, but none more extraordinary than that in 1640, when a poor Fi&s;herman, without Shoes to his Feet, in five Days time commanded the whole Power of <HI>Naples;</HI> and might have liv'd in that Grandeur, if his Mind had chang'd with his ex|alted State; but he was &s;till a Fi&s;herman. His &s;hort-liv'd Fire blaz'd too fierce to la&s;t, and he fell a Victim to the Rage he him&s;elf began.</P>
<P>Their Churches are noble Structures, and beautify'd with Paintings by the be&s;t Hands. Their Women are mo&s;t of 'em beautiful, but
<PB N="146" REF="155">
my Heart had no Room to think of them.</P>
<P>The City is govern'd by very whole&s;om Laws, but one particular Article adds much to the Quiet of it; none are &s;uffer'd to wear Swords but tho&s;e of the Garri&s;ons; &s;o if there's any Ren|counter in the Streets, a Bout at Fi&s;ty-Cuffs generally ends the Di&s;pute: Tho' Bravo's are to be hir'd to do a Murder here as cheap as at <HI>Rome,</HI> and Men of Honour too; for we heard of a Quarrel between two <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Gen|tlemen, where one, according to Cu&s;tom, hir'd a Bravo to murder the other, and gave him his Reward beforehand. But it &s;o fell out, that &s;ome Friends to both Parties reconcil'd the two Gentlemen. The Per&s;on that had bargain'd with the Bravo for the Job, &s;ent to him, and told him of their Reconcilement, but that he might keep the Money. The other told him it was not in his Power to return it him, but he was above receiving Money without doing his Work, and therefore the Gentleman mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;uffer Death. He intreated him, and us'd ma|ny Arguments, but all to no purpo&s;e. When he found nothing would prevail, he told him he would immediately acquaint the Gentleman with his De&s;ign, which he did accordingly. Notwith&s;tanding, the Bravo the &s;ame Evening found his Opportunity, and left the other Gen|tleman for dead upon the <HI>Mole;</HI> tho' he reco|ver'd after a lingring Illne&s;s. But the Bravo had the Impudence to go to the other (when he found the Gentleman was in a fair way of Recovery) and told him he begg'd his Pardon that he had not been as good as his Word, but he would take Care and mend his Hand very quickly. In &s;hort, he was found &s;o re&s;o|lute in the Matter, that the Gentleman was o|blig'd to hire another of the &s;ame Trade to give
<PB N="147" REF="156">
him a Ca&s;t of his Office, and di&s;patch the Bra|vo before he could execute what was de&s;ign'd; and the next Day he was found dead at the very Door of the Gentleman's Hou&s;e he had intended to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate; waiting, as it was &s;up|pos'd, for an Opportunity to do his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>After we had view'd every thing within the City, we went to &s;ee the much fam'd-<HI>Ve&s;uvius,</HI> or the burning Mountain, a League and a half Ea&s;t of the City. The <HI>Neapolitans</HI> call it the Bed-chamber of the Sun, becau&s;e he appears to them fir&s;t from the Top of that Mountain. Round the Bottom of it is the riche&s;t Spot of Ground in the Univer&s;e, I'll not except even the Mines of <HI>Poto&s;i;</HI> for the yearly Vintage pro|duces twelve hundred thou&s;and Ducats. The Middle of the Hill is very plea&s;antly &s;haded with Che&s;nut, and &s;everal other Fruit Trees. The Mountain has a double Top; that to the North terminates in a Plain finely cultivated: The other towards the South, which is the <HI>Volcano,</HI> ri&s;es much higher.</P>
<P>When we had gain'd the Summit, we de|&s;cended gradually into its Bowels, by large Steps cut on purpo&s;e. It has, in Times pa&s;t, done much Damage to the Country round it, by its &s;udden Eruptions; but now it forebodes nothing but Rain, when the Top is envelop'd with Clouds.</P>
<P>When we had &s;ufficiently &s;atisfy'd our Curi|o&s;ities at <HI>Naples,</HI> we took a Tour to <HI>Putzol,</HI> or <HI>Po&s;uolo,</HI> through a Hollow of a Rock, a Mile in Length, and no other Light but what came in at both Ends, and one in the Middle from the Top of the Rock. This &s;ubterraneous Pa&s;|&s;age is pav'd with Stone all through, and the narrowe&s;t Part of it is ten Yards over. About the Middle is a &s;mall Chappel dedicated to the Vir|gin

<HI>Mary.</HI> We vi&s;ited all the Rarities of the Place, particularly <HI>Virgil's</HI> Tomb, which is al|mo&s;t cover'd with Ivy. They told me of a Lau|rel Tree that &s;prouted naturally out of it, but (not to take from that incomparable Man, who&s;e Works are ever-living Laurels) I could not &s;ee any &s;uch thing. We al&s;o view'd the Lake <HI>Ag|nano,</HI> &s;o call'd from the multitude of Serpents or Snakes that fall into it from the pendent Mountains. The Water is of two different Qualities; that ta&s;ted upon the Surface is &s;weet or fre&s;h, but that taken deeper is of a brack|i&s;h Ta&s;te, &s;uppos'd from &s;ome Minerals that in|viron it.</P>
<P>On the South Side of the Lake &s;tands a na|tural Stove, which is call'd St. <HI>German's Stove;</HI> but we had not Curio&s;ity enough to enter it, nor Faith enough to believe a ridiculous Fable that is told concerning it, (tho' it is reported a Saint declar'd it for a Truth) which I &s;hall put down here, and leave my Reader to judge of it him&s;elf. St. <HI>German</HI> was advis'd to repair to this Stove, to cure him of a dangerous Ma|lady: When he came there, he found the Soul of a very pious Man that he knew, tormented with the Heat of the Place. St. <HI>German,</HI> as un|der&s;tanding the Language of Souls, ask'd him how &s;o good a Man as he was in his Life-time, came to be condemn'd to &s;uch a &s;evere Puni&s;h|ment. The Soul very civilly an&s;wer'd him, that it was for &s;iding with <HI>Laurentius,</HI> who op|pos'd <HI>Symacus</HI> in the Popedom; but he was con|vinc'd that his Prayers would fetch him out of that Hot-hou&s;e. St. <HI>German</HI> pray'd heartily, you may be &s;ure, and got the Soul of the Man from out thence; but where it went after, no one could tell. But the Place was call'd ever after St. <HI>German's Stove.</HI></P>

To the Ea&s;t of the bordering Mountain is a Place they call the Cave of Death; for what|ever Thing of Life ventures to the farther End, they &s;ay immediately drops down dead: Tho' a Per&s;on that liv'd in a neighbouring Village ventur'd in often for a Reward. When he came out again he was all of a Sweat, and hard|ly able to &s;tand for five or &s;ix Minutes. When he had recover'd him&s;elf, he took a Dog out of a Bag he had brought with him, and by the means of a wooden In&s;trument made for that Purpo&s;e, thru&s;t him in to the very End, and drew him out dead to all Appearance. When he had remain'd &s;ome time for us to view him, he took him up by the fore Legs, and threw him into the Lake <HI>Agnano;</HI> where he recover'd immediately, &s;wam out, and ran away from us. <HI>Don Antonio</HI> told me it was a hard matter to get a Dog there; for a&s;&s;oon as ever they &s;aw a Stranger, they would run away into the Woods, and &s;neak home again when they were gone; which was the Rea&s;on the Per&s;on that went in, always &s;ecures one for the Occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>A Mile farther we went to the Court of <HI>Vul|can;</HI> a Place unplea&s;ant enough, continually &s;moaking, and &s;uch hot Vapours ari&s;e from the Pores of the Earth that it almo&s;t overcame me. In &s;ome Places Water bubbles out of the Ca|vities; and if we threw a Stone into it, it re|bounded back as if you had &s;truck it again&s;t a Pavement. But the Place is reckon'd to cure a great many Di&s;tempers; e&s;pecially to make Wo|men pregnant, and to cure Di&s;ea&s;es of the Head and Eyes. <HI>Donna I&s;abella</HI> was carry'd over it in a Sedan; but I believe &s;he did not want it upon the &s;core of Barrenne&s;s, as you may under&s;tand in her Story.</P>

We &s;pent &s;ix Weeks in this not unplea&s;ing Entertainment, and <HI>Don Antonio</HI> being pretty well &s;atiated as well as my &s;elf, we went back again to <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>And now my Melancholy gain'd &s;uch Ground upon me, that it was not in the Power of Di&s;&s;i|mulation to hide it. <HI>Don Antonio</HI> and all the Family expre&s;s'd a great deal of Trouble for my Sorrow; and I am well a&s;&s;ur'd there was not any thing in their Power they would have refus'd, to have given me Quiet: But the Mind's Di&s;ea&s;e baffles the Phy&s;ician's Art. At la&s;t a Letter arriv'd from the Fryar, which gave us no other Account, but that he was &s;afe return'd to <HI>Genoa,</HI> and intended to embark for <HI>Rome</HI> in a few Days. This lame Account quite di&s;heart|en'd me, for now we had not the lea&s;t Hope, be|ing we all agreed if he had &s;ucceeded he would have been forward enough to have acquainted us with it. The Knowledge of this ca&s;t me quite down, and my Body was forc'd to &s;ub|mit to the Troubles of my Mind. A &s;trong Fever &s;eiz'd me, and brought me to the Brink of the Grave: And tho' I wi&s;h'd for Death, yet, like common Friends, he fled from me in my Neee&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P><HI>Don Antonio</HI> and his Lady &s;eldom went from my Bed-&s;ide, and had I been a Brother to 'em they could not have regarded me more. But Nature, in &s;pight of my Misfortunes, prevail'd; and I gather'd Strength even again&s;t my Will. They had inform'd me in my Illne&s;s (by my Importunity) of the Fryar's Arrival, and that he had not &s;ucceeded in his Negotiation: But yet they had not told me all the Particulars. I de|&s;ir'd the Fryar might be &s;ent for, and conceal nothing from me of what had pa&s;t. Accor|dingly he came, and gave me the following Re|lation.
<PB N="151" REF="160">
Sir, &s;aid he in <HI>French,</HI> a&s;&s;oon as I arriv'd at <HI>Sallee,</HI> I met with <HI>Hamet</HI> the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Renega|do. He receiv'd me at fir&s;t after a bruiti&s;h manner, but when I declar'd I came to pay him his Demand for one of his Slaves that had made his E&s;cape, he began to be le&s;s &s;our in his Treatment. He &s;aid a great many hand&s;om things concerning <HI>Don Antonio;</HI> but when I be|gan to mention you, he fell into a violent Rage, and vented bitter Reproaches again&s;t you; &s;ay|ing you were a vile Impo&s;tor, had ba&s;ely de|ceiv'd and robb'd him doubly, of his Mi&s;tre&s;s and his Money. I told him I came to ran&s;om the Lady, and pay for whatever Damages you had done. As for the Lady, &s;aid he, &s;he's Food for Fi&s;hes long ago; for rather than &s;he would &s;ubmit to me, &s;he threw her &s;elf overboard, (be|fore we had gain'd the Port, when I had ta|ken her out of a <HI>Saick</HI> one of my Slaves had brought her in from <HI>Mammora)</HI> and, in &s;pight of our Endeavours to the contrary, &s;unk for e|ver to the Bottom. And is &s;he gone! &s;aid I: O Proof of virtuous Love! Happy had I been to have embrac'd the &s;ame Fate!</P>
<P>The Relation of this killing Di&s;a&s;ter took a|way my Sen&s;es for &s;ome time; but when I had recover'd, he went on. I had &s;ome Hope at fir&s;t that this was only a Fiction of his own; but I found in the Town that it was no Secret, and every body declar'd that it was Truth. A Jew confirm'd me in't, whom you had bought &s;everal Things of for your Voyage. He told me that <HI>Hamet</HI> arriv'd without any Woman with him, for he &s;aw him land in a very ill Humour, and had complain'd of him for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing you, to his Superiour at <HI>Mequinez,</HI> and he receiv'd a &s;ufficient Check from him. I was too well convinc'd of the Truth, and therefore
<PB N="152" REF="161">
ha&s;ten'd my Departure, and am very &s;orry I could not &s;ucceed; but it was not in Fate, and I hope you will calmly &s;ubmit to the Will of Heaven, who &s;ends the&s;e Afflictions for Tryals.</P>
<P>The good Friar gave me a great many whol|&s;ome Admonitions: But I was not in a State much to ob&s;erve 'em. I now began to be care|le&s;s of the World, becau&s;e there was nothing in't (&s;ince the Death of my dear Wife) worth my Notice. I had no Thoughts of returning to <HI>England,</HI> tho' I had Opportunities enough; but took a Re&s;olution of going to &s;ome remote Part of the World; imagining, the farther I was from my native Country, I &s;hould be the fur|ther remov'd from my Anxiety. But alas! Sorrow is too con&s;tant a Companion, and there's no parting with it, but by Death.</P>
<P>I begg'd Don <HI>Antonio,</HI> if he heard of any Ship bound for a long Voyage, he would acquaint me with it, which he promis'd me to do, (after finding Per&s;ua&s;ion had no Effect on me.) Two Months pa&s;s'd away, and no news of a Ship; when I began to be very unea&s;y, and told <HI>Antonio,</HI> I would e'en make a Voyage to <HI>Genoa,</HI> where I could not well &s;ail of a Ve&s;&s;el. When he found nothing could &s;tay me, he ask'd me to what Part of the World I would chu&s;e to go? I told him I did not much care where. Why then, &s;aid he, if you plea&s;e, my Father, and I will fit you out a Ship of what Burden you think fit, either for War or Traffick. I thank'd him, and told him I would have it for both, if he pleas'd, and I would be their <HI>Supra-Cargo,</HI> if they thought fit to give me &s;o great a Tru&s;t. In &s;hort, a Ship of two hundred and fifty Ton was bought of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant at <HI>Naples;</HI> a &s;tout new Ve&s;&s;el, that mounted &s;ix and twenty Bra&s;s Guns, and we mann'd her with a hundred Hands, mo&s;t
<PB N="153" REF="162">
<HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> who under&s;tanding I intended for the South Sea, were glad of the Opportunity. Don <HI>Antonio</HI> took care to provide every thing nece&s;&s;ary for Traffick; and I was made Captain, and <HI>Supra-Cargo.</HI> I told him, I hop'd I &s;hould in a few Years bring him a good Account of his Lading. He obligingly an&s;wer'd me, that he hop'd I would come Home reconcil'd to my &s;elf, and he &s;hould think him&s;elf very happy. The wor&s;t of it was, we had no Commi&s;&s;ion, neither would I &s;uffer <HI>Antonio</HI> to procure me one: For we re|&s;olv'd, like <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> to fight only with the E|nemies of our Country.</P>
<P>I chri&s;ten'd my Ship the <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> out of Re&s;pect to <HI>Antonio</HI>'s Lady, and hoi&s;ted <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours on Board. When the Day came I was to go on Board, there were Tears &s;hed on both Sides. I could not, without &s;ome Regret, part with &s;o good a Friend as <HI>Antonio</HI> had prov'd to me; and I am very well convinc'd that they were as &s;incere in their Sorrow,</P>
<P>We &s;et Sail from <HI>O&s;tia,</HI> (where our Ship lay ever &s;ince &s;he came from <HI>Naples)</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>March</HI> 1693, with Intention to &s;teer our neare&s;t Cour&s;e for <HI>America.</HI> Our Ship prov'd an excel|lent Sailor; and we made the <HI>Streights</HI> Mouth in twelve Days from our fir&s;t Departure. When I beheld the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> it brought fre&s;h to my Memory pa&s;t Tran&s;actions; and I long'd for an Opportunity to be reveng'd on the <HI>Moors.</HI> The next Day our Men di&s;cover'd two Sail bearing down the Wind upon us. We thought our &s;elves too well provided to run away; tho' we kept on our Cour&s;e; and perceiving but one of 'em that follow'd us, I ask'd my Men if they were willing to &s;peak with that Ve&s;&s;el, and they cry'd one and all, they would with all their Hearts. We prepar'd for an Engagement with
<PB N="154" REF="163">
all the Expedition imaginable, for fear &s;he might prove of <HI>Barbary.</HI> We hoi&s;ted our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Co|lours, and they did the &s;ame. When we found that, we lay by, that we might be inform'd of the News in <HI>England.</HI> But a&s;&s;oon as ever they came a-long Side of us, they pluck'd down their <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours, and hoi&s;ted tho&s;e of <HI>Morocco</HI> in their Room; calling to us to &s;urrender that In|&s;tant, or it &s;hould be wor&s;e for us. We were a little &s;urpriz'd at fir&s;t in being di&s;appointed; but notwith&s;tanding this, my Men de&s;ir'd I would begin the Fight. We had not open'd our Ports yet, and I order'd my Men not to do it till I gave 'em the Word. I &s;ent a Man to bu&s;y him|&s;elf about the Halliards of our Ancient, that the <HI>Rover</HI> might imagine we were going to &s;trike. We were well provided with &s;mall Arms, and all manner of warlike Stores. I order'd every Man to their Po&s;ts, but not to appear till they heard a Whi&s;tle; upon which they &s;hould open their Ports, and fire both great Guns and &s;mall Arms. The <HI>Rover</HI> thought us long in &s;triking our Colours; he therefore call'd out to us again, and told us if we did not &s;trike that In&s;tant, they would pour a Broad-&s;ide into us. Ju&s;t up|on that, I blew my Whi&s;tle; my Men obey'd my Orders punctually, they bur&s;t open our Ports, thru&s;t out their Guns, and gave 'em a Broad|&s;ide, with a Di&s;charge of their &s;mall Arms. This put 'em in much Confu&s;ion, as not expecting any Oppo&s;ition, and I am certain we kill'd a great many of their Men; for imagining we &s;hould be their Prize without fighting, they had crouded upon Deck all their Hands.</P>
<P>I had tack'd about, and given her another Sa|lute, before they return'd us the Favour. But they were not long backward, but pour'd in up|on us very fa&s;t. My Men did their Bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="155" REF="164">
very well, and the Fight continu'd half an Hour with the utmo&s;t Fury. I began to fancy we &s;hould have but dry Meat (as the Sailors &s;ay) and looking upon their Quarter-Deck, I &s;oon &s;py'd the Renegado <HI>Hamet</HI> giving Directions. At the Sight of him I was both &s;urpriz'd, and pleas'd; but my Soul was fill'd with an unu&s;ual Fury. We were &s;o near, that I could hear every Word he &s;aid, tho' I could not under&s;tand him, becau&s;e he &s;poke in the <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Tongue. As we were tacking about, and charging again, I &s;hew'd my &s;elf to him: I told him he was the only Man in the World that I hated; and that very Day he &s;hould be in my Power, or I in his, or Death &s;hould put an End to both our Lives. He &s;eem'd &s;urpriz'd, but gave me a great deal of abu&s;ive Language. I encourag'd my Men, and de&s;ir'd 'em to fight bravely; for if we fell into their Hands, we &s;hould have no Mercy. I had fir'd my Piece at Random before, that is, at the fir&s;t Per&s;on I &s;aw; but now I levell'd all at <HI>Hamet,</HI> and he the &s;ame at me. At la&s;t I had the good Fortune to fetch him down. At this Sight I could not forbear giving a Shout of Joy, which &s;o affected tho&s;e that were near me, and under&s;tood the Bu&s;ine&s;s, that they fought like &s;o many Fu|ries; and after an ob&s;tinate Fight of two Hours, they &s;truck to us. We gave God Thanks for our Victory; and I immediately went on Board 'em, where we had made a terrible Slaughter, they having lo&s;t by their own Account ninety &s;even Men.</P>
<P>I ask'd &s;ome of the Men, what Ship that was which &s;tood aloof from the Engagement; and they inform'd me it was a Prize they had taken a few Days before, laden with Wine and other Commodities. I then thought of a Stratagem to get her into my Power. I order'd our Ship to
<PB N="156" REF="165">
&s;trike her Colours, and then we hoi&s;ted tho&s;e of the <HI>Moors,</HI> and took our Ship in Tow. When the Prize &s;aw us in that Po&s;ture, &s;he imagin'd the <HI>Moor</HI> had conquer'd, and made all the Sail &s;he could to come up with us; &s;o that we &s;oon came near enough to &s;end our Long-Boat arm'd on Board her.</P>
<P>There were but twelve <HI>Moors</HI> on Board, be|&s;ides Pri&s;oners that were put under Hatches. When our Men had taken care of 'em, I went to 'em, and order'd the Pri&s;oners to be releas'd, de&s;iring the Per&s;on that was the Ma&s;ter to come upon Deck. The <HI>Moors</HI> had not taken any of the Lading out of her. She was a Ship of nine|ty Tons bound for <HI>Leverpool,</HI> laden, as I &s;aid be|fore, with Port-Wines, and &s;everal Jars of Oyl. I told the Ma&s;ter, he was at Liberty to pur&s;ue his Voyage when he thought fit. The poor Man was &s;ome time before he could believe what I &s;aid to be real: But when he was convinc'd, he return'd me the Thanks &s;uitable to the Pre&s;ent I had made him. Yet he would make me a Pre|&s;ent of a couple of Hog&s;heads of Wine, two Jars of Oyl, and two of Rai&s;ons; be&s;ides &s;ix of each to the Ship's Crew. I had lo&s;t &s;eventeen of my Men in the Engagement, and eleven wounded; which I &s;upply'd, by taking as many of the Slaves they had on board of <HI>Hamet</HI>'s Ship, all by their own Choice; and the re&s;t that did not care for &s;o long a Voyage, I recommended to the Ma&s;ter of the Prize, who promis'd me to land 'em all in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>We pillag'd the <HI>Cor&s;air,</HI> and found very good Booty. We had out of her to the Value of two thou&s;and Pounds in Goods, which I enter'd in the Ship's Books for the U&s;e of the Company. We did not know well how to di&s;po&s;e of her Crew; and tho' they de&s;erv'd Death, yet in cool
<PB N="157" REF="166">
Blood I thought it was inhumane; and I con|&s;ider'd they never had injur'd me. So I releas'd 'em by the Con&s;ent of the whole Company, with this Agreement; that they &s;hould make a Pre&s;ent from me to <HI>Mirza</HI> the Eunuch of fifty Pound in their <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Money, which he that had Command over the re&s;t &s;wore by <HI>Mahomet</HI> to perform. When we had taken every thing that was needful for our Voyage out of her, we let her go, and pur&s;u'd our Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>We touch'd at the <HI>Canaries</HI> (or Fortunate I&s;lands) to take in Fre&s;h Water, and turn'd the Lading we had taken out of the <HI>Cor&s;air</HI> into Money: And I &s;har'd it among the Sailors, re|&s;erving a fourth Part for my &s;elf and Owners, as I call'd 'em. I gave the Men by Lotts leave to go a-&s;hore, where they &s;oon di&s;pos'd of their Money for things they wanted; but the chief of their Commerce was for Wine and Brandy, knowing we had a long Voyage to make.</P>
<P>We were obliged to leave the Place &s;ooner than we de&s;ign'd, by rea&s;on our Pilot had unfor|tunately kill'd a <HI>Portugueze,</HI> and the Governor threaten'd to have our Ship &s;topp'd if we did not &s;urrender him up. I under&s;tood that the De|ceas'd had been in the Wrong, and therefore ra|ther than run the hazard of lo&s;ing him, we &s;et Sail from thence the tenth of <HI>April.</HI> The Ca&s;tle fir'd &s;everal Guns with Shot to &s;tay us, but we did not regard it, but kept on our Voyage.</P>
<P>We met with nothing worth Notice till we made the I&s;land of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> one of the <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> and came to an Anchor in ten Fathom Water, in a fine gravelly Bottom.</P>
<P>The&s;e I&s;lands are the <HI>He&s;perides</HI> of the An|cients. The Natives are Blacks, a poor mi&s;era|ble People. They brought us a few Tortoi&s;e, which we exchang'd any Tra&s;h for, and they
<PB N="158" REF="167">
were contented. The Rivulet of fre&s;h Water would hardly &s;upply us, it being almo&s;t dry'd up. But we had Wood enough. The whole I&s;land is not above two Leagues and a half in Length, and half a one in Breadth; very barren of Fruit, Gra&s;s, or Roots, and even Animals. I &s;aw only a few wild A&s;&s;es, and &s;ome Goats, which were too nimble for us, or &s;o far off that they were not worth our wa&s;ting Powder and Shot.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> about two Leagues to the North, is a well-inhabited I&s;land, belong|ing to the Crown of <HI>Portugal.</HI> We re&s;olv'd to go and Anchor there; but the Wind proving fair, we pur&s;u'd our Voyage, pa&s;s'd by the I&s;land <HI>del Fogo</HI> in the Night, and we could perceive the <HI>Volcano</HI> burning like the Flame of a Gla&s;s-hou&s;e. Twenty Days afterwards we pa&s;s'd the Aequi|noctial Line, with the u&s;ual Ceremony of duck|ing all tho&s;e Per&s;ons that had never been there before. But I bought off the be&s;t Part of the Delinquents for an Anchor of Brandy.</P>
<P>The next Day we bury'd two of our Men, who dy'd of the Wounds they had receiv'd in the Fight; but all the re&s;t happily recover'd. We gave 'em three Guns, and committed 'em to the Waves.</P>
<P>In the Latitude of twenty two, we &s;aw a great Number of Fowls, and therefore judg'd we could not be many Leagues from Land, which we di&s;|cover'd &s;oon after to be <HI>The I&s;land of A&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> about two Leagues to the North; but we pa&s;s'd by it, and in two Days more anchor'd in &s;ix Fathom Wa|ter at the I&s;land of St. <HI>Catharines,</HI> about half a Mile from the main Land of <HI>Bra&s;il.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;land lies in twenty &s;even Degrees thirty Minutes of South Latitude. It is almo&s;t a con|tinu'd Grove of Trees, and but thinly inhabited by <HI>Portugueze,</HI> and a few Blacks. They are in
<PB N="159" REF="168">
want almo&s;t of all the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, be&s;ides Provi&s;ion, which is plentiful enough, &s;uch as it is. The Inhabitants are courteous enough, and would not take Money for any thing we had of 'em, but Linnen and Woollen. And after I had got every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary for the Ship, I &s;old 'em Goods to the Value of four hundred Pounds, which I receiv'd in pure Gold. They never have Peace with the <HI>Indians</HI> of the Con|tinent; and being &s;o very near, they have often for|merly made Inroads, and carry'd off the Inhabi|tants. But they have prevented &s;uch Attempts for the future, by building &s;everal Redoubts, where they keep con&s;tant Guard.</P>
<P>They pay no other Taxes but the Church-Tythes, (which they'll be &s;ure not to lo&s;e;) and for Religion, they had but one Friar when I was there; and all his Bu&s;ine&s;s was, as I was in|form'd, only to receive his Tenths.</P>
<P>A <HI>Frenchman</HI> told me a plea&s;ant Story of one of the Inhabitants, an indu&s;trious Fellow that had ten Children; but, notwith&s;tanding his Indu&s;try, found it a hard Matter to bring both Ends to|gether at the Year's End: Tho' the wor&s;t of his Grievances was the Prie&s;t's Tythes, and his Mo|ney. He often endeavour'd to per&s;uade the Fa|ther to forget him a Year or two, but all to no Purpo&s;e. One Day the Father paid him a Vi&s;it, in order to receive his Dues. The poor Man told him ingenuou&s;ly he had it not in his Power to give it him. But he &s;till in&s;i&s;ted. At la&s;t he told him he had but one Way to procure it, and that he fear'd the Church would not allow of. The Friar told him he was the be&s;t Judge of that, if he would tell him what it was. Why, &s;aid the Man, a Per&s;on that lives on the Continent has &s;everal fat Pigs, of a very fine Breed. Now, &s;aid he, I could bring one over with me unper|ceiv'd
<PB N="160" REF="169">
of any one, as I come from my daily La|bour; and &s;uch a one (naming a Neighbour) will give me a good Price for it. The Friar paus'd &s;ome time, but at la&s;t gave him this An&s;wer. It is certainly a Sin to &s;teal, but yet it is a greater Sin to rob the Church of its Due, and therefore I will ab&s;olve you. But bring the Pig to me, for if it's worth &s;o much to your Neighbour, it is worth as much to me. The Man told him he would be &s;ure to bring it him that Night, and the Friar &s;aid if he was not at Home, he would leave Word with his Servant to take Care of it. Now the Friar had no con&s;tant Dwelling here; for they are &s;ent from <HI>Lagoa,</HI> a Town upon the Conti|nent, about ten Leagues to S. S. W. and their Tythes were u&s;ually &s;ent there in a &s;mall Bark kept for that Purpo&s;e. The Prie&s;t took care to be out of the way (that he might &s;wear he knew nothing of the Matter, if it was found out) at the Time when the Man was to come with his Pig; but gave his Servant a &s;trict Order, whatever was brought &s;hould be immediately carry'd on Board, and taken a great deal of Care of.</P>
<P>When the Time came, the Man was as good as his Word, and brought to the Prie&s;t's Hou&s;e his Promi&s;e in a Hand-basket. The Servant o|bey'd his Ma&s;ter's Orders, and went to carry it on Board; but before he could get to the Har|bour, what he had in his Basket began to cry out. The poor Fellow was very much fright|ed to find he had got a Child in the Basket; but fearing, by the Charge his Ma&s;ter gave of it, he was deeply concern'd in the Affair, made all the ha&s;te he could on Board: And the Ve&s;&s;el &s;etting Sail that Night, he went with his Charge to <HI>Lagoa,</HI> where he very &s;ecretly delivered it to the Brotherhood.</P>

The Prie&s;t at St. <HI>Catharines</HI> thought his Man had robb'd him, and made his E&s;cape, be|ing he was mi&s;&s;ing &s;o long; for he had carry'd a great many other things on Board before the Child. The Imagination of this made the Fa|ther very unea&s;y; and the Wind continuing fair, he imbark'd on board a Ve&s;&s;el, and arriv'd at <HI>Lagoa</HI> the Day after his Man. But what was his Surprize, when he found he had got a &s;uck|ing Child, in&s;tead of a &s;ucking Pig! He told the re&s;t of his Brethren the Affront that had been put upon him; and they re&s;olv'd to &s;end the Bantling back again: but either for want of due Care, or through the Fatigue of the Sea, the Child dy'd. When the Friar came back to St. <HI>Catharines,</HI> he ran open-mouth'd to the poor Man, and &s;wore he &s;hould be excommunicated for playing Tricks with the Church. The Man told him, he was forward enough to have his Tythes; &s;o having ten Children, and finding nine too many to keep, he was re&s;olv'd he &s;hould have his Due, and have the Tenth. And farther added, if he offer'd to make any more Stir a|bout it, he would acquaint every body with his encouraging him to &s;teal from his Neigh|bours.</P>
<P>The Father finding the Man had too much Under&s;tanding to be Prie&s;t-ridden, thought it his be&s;t way to hold his Tongue. But the Secret was di&s;clos'd, and the poor Prie&s;t led a &s;ad &s;ort of Life: For whenever he came for his Tythes, many would merrily ask him if he would have his Tithe Pig. In &s;hort, the Friar was &s;ham'd out of the I&s;land, and the Fraternity were ob|liged to &s;end another Man in his Room, who very often hears the Story of the Child, tho' much again&s;t his Will.</P>

We anchor'd at fir&s;t within a Bow-&s;hot of the <HI>I&s;land of Parrots,</HI> in &s;even Fathom Water: But we were inform'd the be&s;t Place to water our Ship, was two Leagues beyond the I&s;land of St. <HI>Catharine.</HI> We had our pre&s;ent Wants &s;upply'd from the Continent, tho' not enough to water the Ship; &s;o we re&s;olv'd to &s;teer for the watering Place, in the Bay of <HI>Arazatiba.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;teer'd between the I&s;land and the Con|tinent, and all the way on each &s;ide we di&s;|cover'd a beautiful Pro&s;pect of Hou&s;es, inviron'd with natural Woods and Groves, which gave the Eye a va&s;t Delight. When we approach'd the Bay of <HI>Arazatiba,</HI> we perceiv'd a Ship, with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours, with her Anchor a-peak, in or|der to di&s;cover who we were. I immediately hoi&s;ted <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours, but prepar'd for an En|gagement, as imagining her to be <HI>French,</HI> (or &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pirate;) for there was War between the two Nations: But I found it was a Privateer, commanded by Captain <HI>Dampier,</HI> who made me a Vi&s;it, after having hail'd us. When he was on Board, he us'd many Per&s;ua&s;ions to engage me to con&s;ort with him, and follow the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Priva|teering; but I told him, I had other Affairs to ma|nage. After I had treated him hand&s;omely with what the Ship afforded, he took his Leave, and invited me to dine on board his Ve&s;&s;el the next Day. I gave him my Promi&s;e to wait on him, and I accordingly went, where I was very hand|&s;omely treated; and there we agreed two Days after to make an Entertainment jointly for the Officers of both Ships on Shore; and the Day after that, for the re&s;t of the Crew.</P>
<P>In order to this I commanded a large Tent to be pitch'd, capable of holding fifty Per|&s;ons; and we &s;trove who &s;hould &s;end the mo&s;t Materials on &s;hore for our Fea&s;t. We had the
<PB N="163" REF="172">
Mu&s;ick of both Ve&s;&s;els; but mine proving to be the be&s;t, as being <HI>Italians,</HI> gave the mo&s;t Delight: not but they join'd in Con&s;ort, and agreed very well.</P>
<P>After Dinner, Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> told me, tho' he could not oblige me with <HI>Italian</HI> Mu&s;ick, yet he had an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Eunuch that &s;ang admi|rably; he added, he could not an&s;wer for his Judgment, but he was very well convinc'd he never heard a finer Voice in his Life. The Per|&s;on was brought in; but my Readers may gue&s;s at my Surprize, when, in the Per&s;on of the Singer, I di&s;cover'd my Mi&s;tre&s;s's Lawyer, whom my Ma|&s;ter and his Friend had equipt for a fine Singer. I knew him a&s;&s;oon as ever I &s;aw him, but I per|ceiv'd by his Behaviour he had no Knowledge of me; neither was it very po&s;&s;ible he could have known me, becau&s;e he had never &s;een me but once, and then he had too much Concern to make any Ob&s;ervations: But the Occa&s;ion had imprinted in my Mind a lively Idea of him.</P>
<P>He &s;ung admirably well, and with good Judg|ment. I ask'd the Captain how he came to be an Eunuch; he told me he could not inform me, neither could he ever prevail upon him to let him know it. We were very merry for &s;e|veral Hours; and I may &s;afely declare that during that Time I had bury'd my inward Malady.</P>
<P>I told the Singer, I believ'd I could let Cap|tain <HI>Dampier</HI> into the Secret of his Ca&s;tration, if he would not be offended at it. He &s;eem'd very much concern'd, and blu&s;h'd; but imagin|ing I knew nothing of the Matter, he gave me his Con&s;ent to &s;ay what I thought fit; yet with the utmo&s;t Chagrine in his Face, as believing he was only going to be the Je&s;t of the Com|pany.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="173">
But when I began to name my Ma&s;ter, and en|ter'd into &s;ome Part of the Story, I found him in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, in&s;omuch that I pity'd him, and told him I would not proceed any farther, without his Con&s;ent. He told me in bad <HI>French,</HI> (for he had ob&s;erv'd that the Captain and I &s;ometimes talk'd to one another in that Language) that I was very welcome to tell his unfortunate Story, but not to &s;o many Audi|tors; for, added he, I perceive you know it very well. I gave him my Word only to tell the Captain, for which he thank'd me; but I told him, in return, that he mu&s;t let me into the re&s;t of his Story; which he promis'd to do. The Captain and I, with my quondam Lawyer, took an Opportunity of leaving the Company, and walking a little way up the River Side, where I inform'd him that I came to the Knowledge of his Story, by the Porter that dogg'd him, (for I did not think it convenient to let him know that I was a Per&s;on concern'd) and that &s;eeing him go into the Coach in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> I remember'd his Face again. He gave us his Story in the following manner.</P>
<P>I was bred up to the Law by my Father, an Attorney of <HI>Lincolns-Inn;</HI> who dying, left me a &s;mall E&s;tate, which I &s;oon &s;pent in none of the be&s;t Company. I had no Thoughts of Bu&s;ine&s;s, 'till drove to it through the utmo&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity. But finding Want approaching began to open my Eyes, I took Chambers in <HI>Cliffords-Inn,</HI> and re&s;olv'd to &s;tick to Bu&s;ine&s;s. I &s;oon found Clients enow through the Credit of my Father; and under|&s;tanding the rough as well as the &s;mooth Part of the Law, I got Mony enough to &s;upply even any Extravagance. I had ever been a very great Ad|mirer of the Female Sex, and had the good For|tune,
<PB N="165" REF="174">
or rather the Ill, to &s;ucceed in mo&s;t of my Amours.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time I ever &s;aw the fatal Cau&s;e of my Misfortune, was at St. <HI>Dun&s;tan</HI>'s Church; (which, to my Shame I mu&s;t own, I too often frequen|ted without Devotion.) Our Eyes often told us the Language of the Heart. I got the Op|portunity of &s;itting in the next Pew to her, but had never once di&s;clos'd my Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>One <HI>Sunday,</HI> as the Clerk had &s;et the P&s;alm, &s;he begg'd I would lend her my Book; &s;ay|ing &s;he had left hers at Home. When &s;he had done, &s;he return'd it me, and thank'd me. I had re&s;olv'd with my &s;elf to have wait|ed on her out of the Church, but was preven|ted by the Per&s;on that was afterwards her Hu&s;|band. When I came home, I pull'd my Pray|er-Book out of my Pocket, but perceiv'd it would not &s;hut as u&s;ual, which put me on ex|amining it. I found a Note pinn'd to the la&s;t Leaf, which I had not ob&s;erv'd before: The Contents were to invite me to an A&s;&s;ignation that Evening at Six.</P>
<P>I was very punctual, and found her there be|fore me. I begg'd her Pardon for making her wait, which &s;he ea&s;ily granted with a gentle Reproach; and we &s;oon came to a right Un|der&s;tanding: for that very Night, before we par|ted, I had what I wi&s;h'd; the Sweet which was fol|low'd by the wor&s;t of Bitters.</P>
<P>She told me &s;he had long had a Pa&s;&s;ion for me; which, tho' &s;he re&s;i&s;ted all &s;he could, got the better of her Mode&s;ty, and forc'd her to declare it. She inform'd me too, that &s;he was &s;peedily to be married to the Man that led her out of Church, tho' it was much again&s;t her Inclination; but &s;he was oblig'd to comply with her Mother's Commands.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="175">
We had many Meetings: &s;ometimes at my Chambers, till I was taken too much Notice of by &s;ome of my Neighbours: And when &s;he was married we often met at different Places, and &s;he as often made me hand&s;ome Pre&s;ents. He then related how he was di&s;cover'd at my Ma|&s;ter's Hou&s;e by one of the Prentices, (meaning me; but as he conceal'd his Face by turning it to the Window, he could not remember him.) He al&s;o related all that I have declar'd in the former Sheets; and added, that when the Operation was over, his Mi&s;tre&s;s, as knowing him of no farther U&s;e to her, left him without &s;peaking a Word. When I had recover'd Strength, &s;aid he, to write, I &s;ent for &s;ome of my intimate Friends, and among the re&s;t a Surgeon. I told him my Misfortune, and was examin'd by him; but I was obliged to &s;tay at the Inn &s;everal Days. At la&s;t (tho' almo&s;t a Miracle) I was per|fectly cur'd, and return'd to my Bu&s;ine&s;s; but my Story getting Air, I was made the Scoff of every Body that &s;aw me; till in &s;hort my Life became a Burthen to me, and I took a Re|&s;olution to go to &s;ome Part of the World where no one &s;hould know me; and getting acquainted with Captain <HI>Dampier,</HI> he favour'd me &s;o far as to enter me Steward. I had learnt to &s;ing when I was young; and my Voice, grow|ing clear by my Lo&s;s, is much improv'd. I had kept my Misfortune a Secret to all the Crew, if I had not receiv'd a Wound in my Thigh by an <HI>Indian</HI> Arrow on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Florida,</HI> a Year ago; for the Surgeon coming to dre&s;s me, when the extream Angui&s;h had taken away my Sen&s;es, perceiv'd my Condition and di&s;clos'd it to the Company: But I have the good For|tune not to be flouted at.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="176">
When the Story was fini&s;h'd, we join'd our Company again, and ended the Day in Mirth and Jollity. The next Day my Crew went on Shore to regale them&s;elves; for Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> and I had alter'd our Re&s;olution of &s;ending both Companies together, for fear of Quarrels and Di&s;order. And his Crew went on Shore the following Day.</P>
<P>About Noon, as I was reading in my Cabin, I heard the Report of &s;everal Pieces; upon which I ran out, and went my &s;elf to the Top|ma&s;t Head, where I perceiv'd my Men, who were filling our Casks at the River of <HI>Parrots,</HI> &s;urrounded by a multitude of <HI>Indians.</HI> I upon the In&s;tant let &s;lip our Cables, and having a &s;trong Sea Breeze, &s;teer'd full into the River's Mouth at all hazards, ordering every Man to his Arms, and to load all our great Guns with Musket Ball. By good Fortune the Tide was almo&s;t at the highe&s;t, &s;o that we came on broad|&s;ide the Rivulet where our Men were defending them&s;elves. They had made a Rampart with the empty Casks, and had kept off the <HI>Indians</HI> with their Pieces; but ju&s;t as we came, they had &s;pent all their Ammunition, and had re&s;olv'd to &s;ubmit to the <HI>Indians.</HI> But a&s;&s;oon as they perceiv'd us, they took to their Heels, and ran towards our Ship, and the <HI>Indians</HI> after them; but we &s;oon &s;topp'd their Career, by firing our double and round, which kill'd 'em above fifty Men, and put the re&s;t to Flight. We took our Men on Board, and intended to fall out of the River, but found the Tide turn'd; and before we could get out our Ship ran a-ground, &s;o that we were oblig'd to wait till the next Tide. I was very unea&s;ie at this Accident, and order'd my Lieutenant to take the Boat, and acquaint Cap|tain <HI>Dampier</HI> with it.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="177">
In the mean time, not to be idle, I arm'd twenty Men, and order'd them to guard the re&s;t while they fill'd our Casks; which was ac|cordingly done, and with the Long-Boat brought on Board. I would not let them be hoi&s;ted into the Ship, for fear of hurting her now &s;he lay aground; tho' it prov'd to be a clayie Bottom.</P>
<P>An Hour before Night we perceived an <HI>Indian</HI> running very &s;wiftly to us, who call'd to us in <HI>Portugueze</HI> to fetch him aboard. A&s;&s;oon as he was in the Ship, he told a Man that under&s;tood <HI>Portugueze,</HI> that the <HI>Indians,</HI> to the Number of a Thou&s;and, de&s;ign'd in the middle of the Night to attack our Ship, and that they would come down in Canoes; for they very well knew we could not get out till Tide of Flood.</P>
<P>This Man, whom we took for an <HI>Indian,</HI> was a <HI>Portugueze</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> had taken Pri&s;oner a Year before, and under&s;tanding their Language learnt their Re&s;olution; and while they were calling their Number together, he took his Opportu|nity to make his E&s;cape. I order'd him to be told he &s;hould be rewarded for his Intelligence. I immediately call'd all the Officers together to con&s;ult about the Danger, and we agreed to &s;end to Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> for Help, who came with fifty Men well arm'd: And by his Ad|vice, a&s;&s;oon as it was dark, we landed &s;ix of our Cannon, and rais'd a &s;mall Battery without any Noi&s;e or Bu&s;tle; the&s;e were pointed up the River &s;launting. Two of our Guns were load|ed with double and round, in the Stern of our Ship. The re&s;t of our Men were order'd in clo&s;e Coverts on each Side the River, with Directions to let the <HI>Indian</HI> Canoes pa&s;s 'em, and not to fire till they were all gone by.</P>
<P>Every thing was concerted and &s;ettled, and every man order'd to his Po&s;t, to expect the
<PB N="169" REF="178">
Charge; and we had contriv'd it &s;o well, that none of our Fires could hurt one another.</P>
<P>About one a-clock in the Morning we could hear their Paddles in the Water, and &s;oon after perceive 'em &s;ilently falling down the River, to the Number of two hundred Canoes. We let them come within fifty Yards of our Ship, be|fore we fir'd; but when we began, we made &s;uch a terrible Slaughter of 'em, that I pity'd 'em. We took one Canoe with twelve <HI>In|dians,</HI> and their Chief among them. When the Morning dawn'd, we were amaz'd to &s;ee what Havock Death had made; the very Shores were &s;tain'd with Blood, and we had not lo&s;t one Man of either of our Crews. The <HI>Portugueze,</HI> who gave us Notice, I rewarded with a hun|dred Pound, and two new Suits of Cloaths, both Linnen and Woollen; and we made U&s;e of him for our Interpreter. He told us we had one of their <HI>Caciques</HI> among the Pri&s;oners, and a Man of great Power among the <HI>Indians.</HI> I order'd him to ask him the Rea&s;on of his En|mity to us, &s;ince we had never offended them. He told him that he took us for <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or <HI>Por|tugueze,</HI> Nations they hated from the barbarous U&s;age they had met with from them: But he was &s;orry he had mole&s;ted us, being he was convinc'd we were <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and Enemies to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as well as them&s;elves: But how|ever, he would pay &s;ufficiently for his Ran&s;om, if we would &s;pare his Life; and accordingly we agreed for a hundred Weight of Gold Du&s;t, and twenty in Ingots, and he order'd one of his Retinue to fetch it. In the mean time, we took the Advantage of the Tide, and fell down to our old Station.</P>
<P>The next Day at Noon two Canoes arriv'd, one with the Gold, and &s;everal Per&s;ons of Qua|lity
<PB N="170" REF="179">
that came to wait on their King; and the other laden with Fruits and Provi&s;ions, which I had equally parted between both Ships Companies. I took the Ingots for my Sharers, and the Du&s;t was divided among us according to our Allowance. Captain <HI>Dampier</HI> and his Crew were mightily pleas'd with their Dividend, and once more pre&s;s'd me to accompany them: but I gave 'em a flat Denial for the pre&s;ent, with this Hope, that when I had vi&s;ited &s;everal Pla|ces in the South-Sea, I would return to St. <HI>Salvador,</HI> and wait two Months for them there.</P>
<P>We put the <HI>Indians</HI> on Shore, and the next Day weigh'd Anchor again, &s;aluting Captain <HI>Dam|pier</HI> with 11 Guns, who return'd the like Number, and we &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e with a fre&s;h Gale, for the Streights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> I intending to pa&s;s thro' tho&s;e Streights into the <HI>South-Sea;</HI> for I was of Opinion it would &s;horten our Voyage; and then my Curio&s;ity &s;trengthen'd that Opinion: But I was advis'd by my Lieutenant to venture up to <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> a Town belonging to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> where he a&s;&s;ur'd me we might drive a very good Trade underhand with the Mer|chants. I communicated the Matter to the whole Company, who unanimou&s;ly agreed it was the be&s;t Cour&s;e we could &s;teer. So we kept in with the Shore, and &s;teer'd for the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> or the <HI>River of Plate,</HI> which we reach'd in twenty Days without any Accident. As we had War with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> I had hoi&s;ted <HI>French</HI> Colours, that we might have the Liber|ty to trade with more Safety.</P>
<P><HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> is &s;ituated above fifty Leagues up the <HI>River of Plate,</HI> which above the Town receives the Name of <HI>Paraguay;</HI> and takes its Ri&s;e many Leagues up the Country; which is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by a numerous Nation of <HI>Indians,</HI> who
<PB N="171" REF="180">
&s;ometimes trade with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but oftner murder 'em when they can meet 'em conveni|ently; for the Spirit of Revenge is &s;uck'd in with their Milk, and handed down from Father to Son; &s;o that they imagine it to be a very meritorious Deed to di&s;patch one of them; and they are generally rewarded by their <HI>Ca|cique</HI> for it.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> takes its Name from the excellent Temperature of the Climate, and its plea&s;ant Situation. They have Com|merce with the Ships of <HI>Europe</HI> not above once a Year, which bring 'em the Nece&s;&s;aries they want, and in Return ea&s;e 'em of their Gold; that being a Metal le&s;s e&s;teem'd than Iron, which proves more u&s;eful to them. When we were within two Leagues of the Port, we came to an Anchor in a little Creek in eight Fathom Water, a &s;andy Bottom. We did not care to go nearer the Town, for fear the Governour &s;hould have taken it in his Head to have hin|der'd our going out again.</P>
<P>Though we were not in Sight of it, yet we had Canoes on board of us in an hour after our anchoring; and &s;ome of Note came <HI>incog|nito,</HI> to be inform'd what we dealt in. One of them told me, he believ'd it would be no diffi|cult thing to di&s;po&s;e of my Cargo, if I thought fit to make the Governour a &s;mall Pre&s;ent. Accordingly I took his Advice, and &s;ent my Steward in my Name, with a Piece of Hol|land, and half a dozen Pieces of <HI>Italian</HI> Silks; which he receiv'd as a very valuable Pre&s;ent, and &s;ent me Word he would not in the lea&s;t mole&s;t me, provided I did not deal too bare|fac'd. I under&s;tood him, and therefore was ve|ry cautious, &s;elling but to one at a time, nor would I &s;uffer another to enter my Ship, till the former was di&s;patch'd.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="181">
In two Days I got rid of all the Cargo that I intended to part with, to a very great Ad|vantage; and then I allow'd my Men Liberty to do what they thought fit with what they had, which gave them a general Satisfaction. The next Day I invited the Governour on Board, with &s;ome of the principal Merchants, and en|tertain'd them in my Cabin; and in return, I was to dine on Shore at the Ca&s;tle. But I left a &s;trict Order with my Lieutenant how to be|have him&s;elf if I &s;hould be &s;topp'd; for I knew the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be unfaithful People.</P>
<P>When we landed, I ob&s;erved the Town made but a mean Appearance, con&s;i&s;ting only of two Streets built in the Form of a Cro&s;s, and &s;urrounded with a Mud Wall. The Ca&s;tle it &s;elf made but an indifferent Figure: but how|ever I was very elegantly entertain'd. The Go|vernor &s;eem'd to have le&s;s of the Formality of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> than ever I met with in any of them. When I took my Leave of him, he made me a Pre&s;ent of two <HI>Indian</HI> Slaves, and a Bar of Gold that weigh'd three Pound two Ounces. When I came on Board, I call'd a Council, to know what Cour&s;e we &s;hould &s;teer next; for as to Traffick, I had no Pretence to go to the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> being all my Cargo was already di&s;pos'd of. We debated for &s;ome time, and at la&s;t we all agreed to go for the <HI>South-Sea</HI> upon the &s;core of Privateering. We com|municated our Intentions to the Company, and they all &s;eem'd very much rejoic'd at the Re|&s;olution I had taken.</P>
<P>Now I began to repent I had not join'd with Captain <HI>Dampier;</HI> for I wanted Men for any no|table Exploit, but I did not de&s;pair of meet|ing with him in the <HI>South-Sea.</HI> We weigh'd Anchor, and &s;teer'd for the Streights of <HI>Magel|lan</HI>
<PB N="173" REF="182">
with a fair Wind. One Morning my Ser|vant wak'd me, and told me that a Sail bore down upon us, and the Lieutenant de&s;ir'd to know how to behave him&s;elf. I ro&s;e upon the In&s;tant, and, by the help of my Per&s;pective, &s;aw it was a Ve&s;&s;el with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours; but I imagining they were put up only for a Shew, I caus'd <HI>French</HI> Colours to be hoi&s;ted, which &s;oon was an&s;wer'd by the &s;ame in the Ship that pur&s;u'd us. I order'd every thing to be prepar'd for an Engagement without any Hur|ry, commanded my Men not to appear upon Deck, and kept on my Cour&s;e with crouded Sail, that our Pur&s;uers might imagine I was willing to get from them; yet I order'd it &s;o by fal&s;e Steering, that they gain'd upon us. About Three in the Afternoon they were with|in half a League of us, firing every Quarter of an Hour a Gun to Leeward, to let us know we were to take them for Friends.</P>
<P>I order'd our Men to tack about, hoi&s;t up <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours, and bear upon 'em. We &s;oon perceiv'd we had much &s;urpris'd 'em, but not|with&s;tanding they kept up their <HI>French</HI> Colours, and &s;eem'd to prepare for the Engagement, tho' they were much inferior to us. When we came along Side I hal'd 'em, and (after owning they were <HI>French)</HI> commanded them to &s;urrender; but was an&s;wer'd with a Broad&s;ide, which we return'd &s;o fa&s;t, that they &s;oon &s;truck, and call'd for Quarter. I order'd the Captain to come on Board, who inform'd me that his Ve&s;&s;el was call'd the <HI>Felicity,</HI> belonging to Mon|&s;ieur <HI>de Gennes,</HI> and had been &s;eparated from the Fleet three Days before. I us'd the Cap|tain very hand&s;omly, for the Sake of Mon&s;ieur <HI>St. Olon</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador. I gave him a Letter and a &s;mall Pre&s;ent for that Gentleman,

and di&s;mi&s;s'd him without taking any thing from them. I found this Action did not plea&s;e &s;ome of my Men; and not caring to have them un|ea&s;ie, I &s;ummon'd them upon the Deck, and told 'em the Obligations I had to the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador; acquainting them, as this was a Ship of War, there was not much to be expected from 'em, therefore I told 'em I would &s;hare five hundred Pound among 'em to make 'em Amends for their Di&s;appointment. But not one of them would accept a Penny; and in return I told them, I did not intend to make any more &s;uch Compliments to the <HI>French,</HI> if ever they came into my Power again. They were very well pleas'd with my Declaration, and &s;ome of them prais'd my Genero&s;ity; for tho' mo&s;t Sailors are rough and blunt in Speech, yet they can in their way admire a generous Ac|tion as well as other Men.</P>
<P>Our Officers were under &s;ome Apprehen&s;ions of meeting with the Squadron of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Gennes,</HI> which being a Fleet of five Sail would certainly be too hard for us; and we were in|form'd by the Captain of the <HI>Felicity</HI> that they were &s;ail'd for the Streights of <HI>Magellan.</HI> I found their Fears very rea&s;onable, and it would be a fool-hardy Action to encounter a Force &s;o much &s;uperior: For though Life was burthen|&s;ome enough to me, yet Humanity oblig'd me not to hazard the Lives of &s;o many Men that were not out of Love with this World. So I re&s;olv'd to wave my Curio&s;ity, and make for <HI>Le Maire</HI>'s Streights; which in five Days time we di&s;cover'd, known to Sailors by three Rocks, call'd the <HI>Three Brothers</HI> from their Likene&s;s to one another.</P>
<P>We found a &s;trong Current &s;etting North|ward, and an unu&s;ual To&s;&s;ing of the Ship;
<PB N="175" REF="184">
but we got through the Streights in two Days with Safety, and made for the <HI>South-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day we di&s;cover'd the <HI>Magellan Clouds,</HI> &s;o well known to Sailors, which con|vinc'd us that we were over-again&s;t tho&s;e Streights that run into the <HI>South-Sea.</HI> The&s;e Clouds are always &s;een in the &s;ame Degree, and the &s;ame orbicular Form. We kept on our Cour&s;e, not intending to come within Sight of the Continent for fear of a Di&s;covery; and the Weather favour'd us, it continuing ve|ry hazy.</P>
<P>About an Hour within Night we heard the Sound of a Trumpet, which we conjectur'd mu&s;t be on oard of &s;ome Ve&s;&s;el, becau&s;e we were well a&s;&s;ur'd we were not near enough the Land; upon which I immediately gave Orders to put out all our Lights, and &s;teer our Cour&s;e that Way we heard the Sound; which Sound|ing often gave us true Notice of their Cour&s;e; and in half an Hour, tho' pretty dark, we gain'd Sight of 'em: But their Mirth was &s;oon chang'd when we got up with 'em, thru&s;t out our Guns, and hail'd 'em. We under&s;tood they were <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and I order'd 'em to be told if they did not upon the In&s;tant lye by, and &s;end their Commander on Board, I would immedi|ately fire upon 'em. They very readily com|ply'd with my Orders, hoi&s;ted out their Boat, and the Captain came on Board me, who&s;e Name was <HI>Don Juan Villegro,</HI> and his Ship the <HI>Wild-fire.</HI> He was employ'd by the Viceroy of <HI>Peru,</HI> to carry condemn'd Per&s;ons to <HI>Baldivia,</HI> which is the Re&s;idence of mo&s;t of the Rogues of <HI>America.</HI> But we were al&s;o inform'd they had the <HI>Real Situado</HI> on Board, which is a Sum of Money &s;o call'd, that is &s;ent from the Vice|roy of <HI>Peru</HI> to pay and cloath the Garri&s;on, as
<PB N="176" REF="185">
well as to repair the Fortifications of <HI>Baldivia.</HI> This Sum u&s;ually amounted to four hundred thou&s;and Crowns, but we could find no more than two hundred and fifty thou&s;and; but then, to make Amends for the Deficiency, we met with a great many valuable <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods, brought from thence by their <HI>Manilla</HI> Ship; for the Merchants always put their Supply for <HI>Bal|divia</HI> in the Ship that carries the Money to pay the Garri&s;on, that being the only Time to di&s;|po&s;e of their Goods.</P>
<P>This Prize made my Men mad with Joy, and I fear'd it would make 'em think they &s;hould have enough, and con&s;equently de&s;ire to return home. But I &s;oon found it had the con|trary Effect, and they all expected, from this Earne&s;t of good Fortune, Riches enough in the Voyage we propos'd, to make 'em for ever.</P>
<P>I treated the Pri&s;oners hand&s;omely, which were forty-&s;ix, including fifteen Felons, who were well pleas'd to have chang'd their Ma|&s;ters; expecting better U&s;age from us than from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Baldivia,</HI> where they were de|&s;ign'd. There was one <HI>Roberts,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> among them, who, I have been inform'd, has been executed &s;ince for Piracy; him, two <HI>French|men,</HI> four <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the Trumpeter, I en|ter'd in my Books to reinforce my Crew; un|der&s;tanding their Crime was only Su&s;picion of Pi|racy, therefore I was convinc'd they were good Sailors. But I did not know how to di&s;po&s;e of the Ship and the re&s;t of the Crew. If I &s;hould give 'em their Liberty, they would of cour&s;e alarm the Country; and if I kept them with me, Provi&s;ions would fall &s;hort; for they were victual'd but for a Month's Voyage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain being inform'd of my Fears, told me by an Interpreter, that he had
<PB N="177" REF="186">
receiv'd &s;uch hand&s;ome U&s;age from me, that he would upon his Honour &s;teer to what Port I thought fit, and report if I pleas'd that I was &s;ail'd back again for the North Sea. I told him, though I could rely upon his Honour, he could not an&s;wer for all the re&s;t. At la&s;t I thought of a Stratagem to deceive the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Captain as well as the other Pri&s;oners, as follows. In the fir&s;t Watch of the Night (the Pri&s;oners being all under Hatches) I came to our Sailors upon Deck, and told 'em the ill Con&s;equence of keeping or letting go the Pri|&s;oners; and therefore concerted with 'em that they &s;hould pretend a Mutiny the next Day, and all declare for going back through the Streights into the North Sea. When the fir&s;t Watch was reliev'd, I acquainted the other Moiety of the Company, and then retir'd to Re&s;t. But my Slumbers were broken with Vi|&s;ions of my dear Mrs. <HI>Villars:</HI> I dreamt I &s;aw her in the Arms of the Renegado <HI>Hamet,</HI> &s;trug|gling and calling out on me for Help, and be|fore I could come to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, Death had freed her from the barbarous Wretch. This Dream had brought to my Mind all my Afflic|tions, and I can't tell how long I &s;hould have continu'd feeding upon my Sighs, if I had not been alarm'd with Shouts and Noi&s;es upon Deck. I ran out to &s;ee what was the Mat|ter, and found my Men, as was de&s;ign'd, in their feign'd Mutiny. I had forgot at fir&s;t, and was much alarm'd; but recollecting, I car|ry'd on the Cheat. And Grief had &s;o &s;eated her|&s;elf on my Countenance, with Thoughts of my Dream, that one of the Quarter-Ma&s;ters told me afterwards, my Looks were enough to de|ceive all the World.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="187">
The <HI>Spaniards</HI> had leave to be upon Deck all the Day, and Care was taken to let them into the Secret. At Dinner I told the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cap|tain (for he and the Merchants always eat with me) that I thought his Speeches ye&s;terday were prophetic, for I was compell'd to comply with my ob&s;tinate Crew, and &s;ail for the North Sea again. He reply'd, he wi&s;h'd me happy where|ever I went: And to carry on the Deceit, we &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e back again.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon <HI>Roberts</HI> came to me, and told me that one of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who was willing to &s;tay with us, would undertake to bring me ten thou&s;and Pieces of Eight in ten Days, if I would let him have the Prize. Up|on what <HI>Roberts</HI> &s;aid, I &s;ent for the Man, and had him examin'd by <HI>Roberts,</HI> who under&s;tood <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> very well. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> told me, he would not have me enquire into the Matter till it was done; and for the better Security I might &s;end who I thought &s;it with him, pro|vided he had one of his Companions that was to help in the De&s;ign. Accordingly I order'd twenty Hands, and to obey the <HI>Spaniard</HI> in this Expedition as if he were their Captain.</P>
<P>We agreed to wait for them the limited Time, in the &s;ame Degree we parted from 'em. I inform'd the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain, by an Interpre|ter, that his Countryman was gone upon &s;ome &s;ecret Expedition, and a&s;&s;oon as he return'd we would pur&s;ue our Cour&s;e. He an&s;wer'd, what|ever he had undertaken he was of the Opini|on he would &s;ucceed in it, for he had certain|ly as much Cunning as any Per&s;on in the World; he had been condemn'd to <HI>Baldivia</HI> once before, and had made his E&s;cape from thence; and he did not doubt but he would get from them again, if he had been carry'd there the
<PB N="179" REF="188">
&s;econd time; and farther gave me &s;ome Hints that he might deceive me in this Underta|king.</P>
<P>I began to be in &s;ome fear of having a Knavi&s;h Trick play'd me, and would have recall'd the Ve&s;&s;el if it had not been too late; but hoping for the be&s;t, I re&s;olv'd to crui&s;e till the Time appointed was expir'd.</P>
<P>I had cloath'd my two <HI>Indians,</HI> that were pre&s;ented me by the Governour of <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> in <HI>European</HI> Habits very hand&s;ome; and in&s;truct|ed them in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue: They very rea|dily learnt; and I gave them all the tender U&s;age imaginable, which they were obligingly &s;en&s;ible of; and I believe they would have &s;acrific'd their Lives to have &s;erv'd me. I found them very handy, and docible, and very good-natur'd; which convinces me, if mild Methods were us'd with them, they might be very ea&s;ily wrought to be Friends to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> e&s;pe|cially the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> And I think 'tis great Pity &s;uch a va&s;t Body of People &s;hould be ignorant of the Divine Being that form'd the Univer&s;e. Though the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (it's true) &s;end <HI>Mi&s;&s;iona|ries</HI> among them to inculcate Chri&s;tianity, yet they generally neglect their holy Functions, and &s;trive all they can to inrich them&s;elves, by laying exorbitant Taxes upon the poor <HI>Indians:</HI> And I have been inform'd, that in &s;ome Parts of <HI>America</HI> all the Wealth they get is deliver'd to the <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> re&s;erving to them&s;elves only what is needful, and that but from Day to Day. I had my two <HI>Indians</HI> made Chri&s;tians; one by by the Name of <HI>Robert,</HI> and the other <HI>Jo&s;eph;</HI> being mine and my Father's Names. And I hope, in the Sight of God, Lay-Bapti&s;m will &s;uffice; e&s;pecially when we had not the Hap|pine&s;s of the other Form. And it is not
<PB N="180" REF="189">
impo&s;&s;ible, if they lead good Lives, they may find the Road to Heaven as well as if they had been chri&s;ten'd in a Church, by an orthodox Clergyman.</P>
<P>Three Days before the Time I expected my <HI>Spaniard</HI> back, we di&s;covered two Sail making up to us, which made us prepare for an En|gagement; but we &s;oon perceiv'd it was our Prize, with another Ve&s;&s;el. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> came on Board, and inform'd me that he had been &s;omething better than his Word, for he believ'd that in Money and in Goods he had brought to the Value of 80000 Dollars. He gave us the following Account, by <HI>Roberts.</HI> La&s;t time I was Pri&s;oner at <HI>Baldivia,</HI> I was compell'd to work for one <HI>Don Sancho Ramirez,</HI> a &s;ordid, covetous, jealous, malicious Wretch, one that us'd to deal in Merchandize. It was his u&s;ual Method to wait at a Country Hou&s;e near the Sea, for the Arrival of the <HI>Real Situado</HI> Ship, (which was the &s;ame I had taken) and then go private|ly on Board to deal with the Merchants. The Knowledge of this made me undertake this Ex|pedition, as well to get Money, as to be re|veng'd on the old Villain, for the Stripes he has often given me without any Provocation. When we arriv'd within half a League of the Place, we perceiv'd a Bark riding at Anchor. I began to demur, as fearing we might be di&s;|cover'd; but at la&s;t re&s;olv'd to proceed, let what would happen. The Bark weigh'd and made towards us, which occa&s;ion'd another Sur|prize; but my Fears were &s;oon over, when I perceiv'd <HI>Don Sancho</HI> upon Deck. He hail'd us, and de&s;ir'd we would &s;lacken Sail, that he might come on Board. Accordingly we ran into a &s;mall Creek, and came to an Anchor. I did not appear at fir&s;t, but let the other
<PB N="181" REF="190">
<HI>Spaniard</HI> that went with us per&s;onate the Captain, and in&s;tructed him accordingly. A&s;&s;oon as he came on Board, he enquir'd for <HI>Don Juan Villegro,</HI> (for that Gentleman us'd to command the <HI>Real Situado)</HI> and was an&s;wer'd that he was very ill, and could not &s;ail this Voyage. Then he enquir'd for the Merchants, telling him that the Governor had di&s;cover'd his u&s;ual Practice of Dealing fir&s;t with them; therefore he had con|triv'd to meet us in one of his own Ve&s;&s;els, that was ready laden for <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and only &s;taid for our Arrival to &s;et Sail. I was glad to hear of that, becau&s;e I intended to make Prize of it. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> invited him into the Cabin, while I went on board his Bark with ten Men arm'd, and &s;ecur'd it, there being but five Men and a Boy in it. The re&s;t of the Crew were on Shore.</P>
<P>I cut her Cable, and our own, and made out to Sea again. When we were under Sail, I came on Board, and &s;hew'd my &s;elf to the old <HI>Don,</HI> and in a few Words made him under&s;tand his Condition. I thought at fir&s;t we &s;hould have been obliged to have bury'd him, for he look'd for a great while like one that was dead. But I recover'd him a little, by &s;hewing him the Box that contain'd his Heart and Soul, (I mean his Money). He did his Endeavour to fly at me to be reveng'd on me, but he was held; but to give him a little more Comfort, I read over to him his Bill of Lading, and told him plainly, I would not deal with him, if his Goods did not an&s;wer his Bill. When he found he could do no good by Pa&s;&s;ion, he told me he would give me half his Money, if I would re&s;tore him his Ship and Cargo. I was very well as I was, I told him; and &s;ince I had got it all in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I would have no more Dealings with him, only
<PB N="182" REF="191">
the odd ten thou&s;and Pieces of Eight more for his Ran&s;om. He was &s;o thunder-&s;truck at this, that he did not &s;o much as offer to open his Mouth to &s;peak; but kept &s;o long &s;ilent, that I fancying he would never &s;peak again, took him upon Deck, that he might behold the lovely Pro&s;pect of the Water; for by this time we were out of Sight of Land. His Heart then began to melt, and he fell down upon his Knees, and begg'd he might have his Liberty, notwith&s;tanding we had robb'd him. I was in a very great Pa&s;&s;ion, and order'd him to mollify the Word, and call it Over-reaching; which with much Cha&s;ti&s;ement he did. But I told him he was obliged to make your Honour one Vi&s;it, and accordingly I have brought him to wait on you.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I could not help admiring the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s Ingenuity, and yet I did not greatly reli&s;h the Action; for tho' it was lawful Prize to us, yet I thought it was downright Robbery in him. However, I gave him the Thanks our Intere&s;t requir'd; and further told him (by <HI>Roberts</HI> our Interpreter) that he &s;hould be very well reward|ed for his Undertaking.</P>
<P>The old <HI>Spaniard</HI> was brought on Board us, more dead than alive; and under&s;tanding we were <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> he &s;poke to me in that Language, and begg'd he might be &s;et at Liberty. I told him he need not apprehend any thing, for he &s;hould have his Liberty, and civil U&s;age. He thank'd me as well as his Grief would give him leave, and I invited him to dine with me, which he did accordingly the &s;ame Day.</P>
<P>I order'd the Cargo out of the Bark, which was very con&s;iderable, and mo&s;t of the Provi&s;ion, becau&s;e I fear'd it would be what we &s;hould want. The other Ve&s;&s;el, as belonging to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and one who could pretty well
<PB N="183" REF="192">
bear that Lo&s;s, I intended to keep for our &s;elves. The Bark I re&s;tor'd to <HI>Don Ramirez,</HI> with &s;eve|ral Bales of Goods that would prove of &s;mall U&s;e to us, tho' of Value to him; nay I would very willingly have given him all his Goods and Money too, if it had not been for wronging my Crew; for, as I &s;aid, I look'd upon it as gain'd by Fraud. However, I ventur'd to give him back twenty thou&s;and Ryals, which did not a|mount to mine and my Owners Share. He re|turn'd me his Acknowledgments, by giving me a very hand&s;ome Ring, that they had not taken from him, and told me, he ever thought the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> generous Enemies.</P>
<P>I caus'd all the Pri&s;oners to be put on Board the Bark, and took my leave of 'em. They re|turn'd me abundance of Thanks for my kind U&s;age; and vow'd, if ever Fortune &s;hould &s;end any of our Countrymen among 'em, they &s;hould fare the better for my Sake. I mu&s;t own, I was not di&s;pleas'd with their Acknowledgments. A Man feels a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure within him&s;elf, when he has done a humane Action; when on the contrary, if a Per&s;on has been guilty of Ba&s;ene&s;s, Horror and Remor&s;e gnaw his In|wards.</P>
<P>The Day after I had parted with the Pri&s;o|ners, I &s;ummon'd all my Men upon Deck, and told 'em what the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had done for 'em, and advis'd with 'em what Recompence I &s;hould make him. We &s;oon agreed he &s;hould have five thou&s;and Pieces of Eight, his Compa|nion five hundred, and the re&s;t of 'em enter'd to a Share of the Booty we had before taken. Ac|cordingly I &s;ent for 'em, and told 'em what I intended. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> return'd me &s;uitable Thanks in <HI>French,</HI> for he had been inform'd I under&s;tood that Language. I found in his Di&s;|cour&s;e
<PB N="184" REF="193">
a ready turn of Wit and Humour, and of a Per&s;on that had read Mankind. He did not &s;eem to be above thirty Years of Age, of a free and open Nature, having nothing of the &s;tiff Formality of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> tho' born at <HI>Sevil</HI> in <HI>Old Spain.</HI> I told him, I expected a &s;hort Ac|count of his Life; he readily an&s;wer'd, he &s;hould be proud to comply with my De&s;ires, but he begg'd I would defer it for &s;ome Time, till he might be a little more us'd to my Conver&s;ation; for, &s;aid he &s;miling, mine has been a very merry and odd &s;ort of a Life, and therefore till I have more Freedom, I &s;hall de&s;i&s;t, becau&s;e I &s;hall lo&s;e the Spirit in telling it.</P>
<P>We &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e towards <HI>Panama,</HI> de|pending that our Pri&s;oners would &s;pread the Re|port of our going back again for the North Sea. In thirty &s;ix Degrees, and forty five Minutes, we di&s;cover'd a Ve&s;&s;el &s;teering the &s;ame Cour&s;e; I order'd the Prize to cha&s;e her, and before Night &s;he took her. It was a Bark laden with Tallow and Hides, bound for <HI>La Conception.</HI> I repented the taking of her, for we &s;oon found &s;he was but a heavy Sailor, and therefore could not keep Company with us, and it was not pro|per for us to let 'em depart.</P>
<P><HI>Don Pedro Aquillio,</HI> which was the Name of of our Intelligent <HI>Spaniard,</HI> told me, he would undertake to di&s;po&s;e of the Cargo and Bark to a good Advantage, if I could tell how to di&s;|po&s;e of the Men, which were but four, that is three <HI>Indians</HI> and a <HI>Spaniard.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> were very well pleas'd to be receiv'd as Servants on Board; yet we allow'd 'em a half Share in our future Purcha&s;es. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> we intended to detain on Board till we had made our crui&s;ing Voyage, and then relea&s;e him. So depending on <HI>Don Pedro</HI>'s Ingenuity, I let him go off with
<PB N="185" REF="194" MS="y">
the Bark, with three <HI>Spaniards</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, having his Promi&s;e to return the next Day. We were then within five Leagues of <HI>La Conception,</HI> and therefore re&s;olv'd to remain in that Station till his Arrival, keeping <HI>Mamelles de Biobio,</HI> or the Dugs of <HI>Biobio</HI> (two Rocks &s;o call'd) in View.</P>
<P>The next Day we perceiv'd him coming with a Pirogue, a &s;mall <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Boat with one Sail. He brought me a hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent of Fruit, and enough be&s;ides for the whole Crew. Well, &s;aid he, I have made but an indifferent Bargain; I have brought you but twenty thou&s;and Pieces of Eight: The old Rogue of a Governor would not give any more. He told me that the Go|vernor of <HI>La Conception</HI> ingro&s;&s;ed all the Tallow and Hides, and forc'd the Retailers to give him his own Price; &s;o he went boldly to him, and &s;old him Bark and Cargo.</P>
<P><HI>Don Pedro</HI> advis'd us to crui&s;e for the <HI>Manilla</HI> Ship, which was daily expected. His Advice was approv'd on all Hands, therefore Orders were given to Wood and Water the Ships for the Voyage; and accordingly we made for <HI>Juan Fernando,</HI> and arriv'd there the fifth of <HI>September</HI> 1695. It being a remarkable Day with me, it lives in my Memory; for the lo&s;s of my Journal by an odd Accident, hinders my keeping a regular Account. We &s;pent but two Days in wooding and watering, and killing Goats, which are there in great Plenty.</P>
<P>There are three I&s;lands that bear the Name of <HI>Juan Fernando,</HI> the fir&s;t Di&s;coverer, tho' there are no other Inhabitants on them than Goats. There's a noble Bay on the North Side of the I&s;land, capable of containing five hundred Sail, where you anchor at &s;ixteen Fathom Water, a &s;andy Bottom. We left it with a favourable Wind for our De&s;ign, and made farther up the
<PB N="186" REF="195">
Coa&s;t <HI>January</HI> the fir&s;t; and it was fear'd we had mi&s;s'd our Booty, for the <HI>Manilla</HI> Ship ge|nerally arrives at <HI>Acapulco</HI> about <HI>Chri&s;tmas;</HI> how|ever we re&s;olv'd to coa&s;t about for twenty Days longer, and if we fail'd of her, to return into the North Sea, with a De&s;ign to cruize down the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>We kept out of Sight of Land, for fear of being di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth we perceiv'd two Sail, and ac|cordingly gave 'em Chace. <HI>Don Philip</HI> a&s;|&s;ur'd me it was the <HI>Manilla</HI> Ship, and a Guard-Ship along with her. We call'd a Council im|mediately; where it was re&s;olv'd the Bark &s;hould attack the <HI>Manilla</HI> Ship, while ours was to en|gage the Man of War: And this was the Rea|&s;on <HI>Don Pedro</HI> gave for it; that the <HI>Manilla</HI> Ship was &s;o very unweildy, the Bark could play round her, and being &s;o &s;mall, &s;he was out of the reach of their Cannon, for they could make no U&s;e but of tho&s;e upon their upper Deck. The Man of War &s;eeing we gave 'em Chace, &s;lacken'd her Sail to &s;tay for us, imagining we &s;hould both attack him, but he found him&s;elf mi&s;taken. Our <HI>Pink</HI> pa&s;t him, without firing a Gun; but a&s;&s;oon as ever we came a-long Side, we gave him a Broad|&s;ide, with a loud Huzza. He &s;oon return'd it, but we ply'd him &s;o clo&s;e, that he began to make off; but we follow'd him clo&s;e at the Heels, and coming under his Starboard Quarter, gave him another Broad-&s;ide, which brought his Main-Ma&s;t by the Board; upon which he im|mediately &s;truck.</P>
<P>The Sea being very &s;mooth, tho' a hand&s;ome Breeze of Wind, we mann'd our Long-boat, and I went on Board with forty Hands, well arm'd. When I came upon Deck, I order'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be taken on Board, and

&s;ecur'd under Hatches; but I was much &s;ur|priz'd to find but &s;ixteen Men in the Ship, be|&s;ides eight that were kill'd, and not one that ap|pear'd like an Officer among 'em. But we were &s;oon inform'd, the Captain had order'd one hun|dred and fifty of his Men on Board the <HI>Manilla</HI> Ship, a&s;&s;oon as they had di&s;cover'd us in the Morning, becau&s;e her Crew were mo&s;t of 'em &s;ickly.</P>
<P>We imagin'd our &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t have warm work on't, being not above thirty five Hands in all. So we re&s;olv'd immediately to cut off the Rud|der of the Man of War, and leave her; for having lo&s;t her Main-Ma&s;t, &s;he could not follow us to do us any Damage; and &s;ix of her Men we took on Board us, who finding we were <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;eem'd very willing to &s;erve us; and I promis'd 'em their Share in the Booty, if we &s;ucceeded. The&s;e &s;ix Men were old <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> as they call them&s;elves, and they value them|&s;elves very much upon it, de&s;pi&s;ing the <HI>Creolians.</HI> We made all the Sail we could after the <HI>Manilla</HI> Ship, and &s;oon overtook her; for our &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;el had kept her very well in Play, tho' &s;he had warm Work on't, and her Rigging was very much &s;hatter'd, tho' they had not lo&s;t a &s;ingle Man, but &s;he was obliged to fall a-&s;tern to mend her Tackle. I order'd 'em to &s;end me twenty Men on Board, which I was oblig'd to lye by for&punc; I had brought all my Guns to bear on one Side, and did not fire one till I came under her Stern; and then I pour'd 'em into her, and tack'd about to charge again. I ob&s;erv'd a Boat bu&s;y about her Stern, but could not imagine what they were doing. However I re&s;olv'd they that were in it &s;hould find a difficult Matter to get on Board again. But I was much &s;urpriz'd to find it my own Boat with <HI>Don Pedro</HI> in it, who
<PB N="188" REF="197">
had taken the occa&s;ion in the Smoak of our fir&s;t Broad-&s;ide to nail up the Rudder, &s;o that the Ship could not tack about. He made what ha&s;te he could on Board the Bark, which had now mended all her Rigging, and got under her Stern; and as fa&s;t as the <HI>Manilla</HI> Ship &s;ent Men to clear her Rudder, he prevented 'em with his Small-&s;hot. In the mean time we ventur'd to come a-long Side of her, notwith&s;tanding her mon&s;trous Bulk, and gave her &s;uch Entertain|ment, that they call'd out at la&s;t for Quarter, and &s;truck their Colours. I order'd all the Of|ficers to come on Board, which they did. I receiv'd 'em all very civilly, and immediately after went on Board the Prize. I was amaz'd at her va&s;t Bulk. She had &s;even Decks, and built &s;o &s;trong, that not one of our Shot had gone through; yet they had above &s;ixty Men kill'd, through their Ports, and other Vacancies; and what was very &s;urprizing, we had not one, and but two wounded.</P>
<P>They had above one hundred Men &s;ick on Board 'em, &s;o that the Ship look'd like an Ho&s;pi|tal. It was very richly laden, and valu'd at 1800000 Dollars, and upwards. We found but little Money on Board, be&s;ides the Plate belong|ing to the Governor of <HI>Luconia,</HI> one of the <HI>Philip|pine</HI> I&s;lands, who was coming home to his own Country, being a Native of <HI>Mexico.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' this was the riche&s;t Prize that ever was taken, yet we did not know well what to do with it. It would be an Impo&s;&s;ibility to work her into the North Sea, or back again to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> without farther help; for we had more Pri&s;oners by two to one, than we had Sailors on Board. So we once more advis'd with <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> who coun&s;ell'd us to &s;end to <HI>Acapulco,</HI> and have the Ship and Men ran&s;om'd.
<PB N="189" REF="198">
We all thought it would be both difficult and dangerous. <HI>Don Pedro</HI> told us there &s;hould be neither, and he would undertake to do it. But however, as it was a thing of very great Con|&s;equence, we de&s;ir'd he would tell us in what manner it &s;hould be done; Why as thus, (&s;aid he) I'll take the Bark, with the Captain of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of War, the Quondam Governor, and one or two more of the be&s;t Quality, who &s;hall make the Ca&s;e known to the City of <HI>Acapulco,</HI> and no other way but by Letter; for I will &s;uffer but one of them to go on Shore, and I'll take care to order it well enough to give you Notice, if they &s;hould &s;end any Force a|gain&s;t us, tho' there is no Danger they &s;hould. For, added he, they have no Man of War with|in two hundred Leagues of 'em, that which was taken being all they had to guard their Coa&s;t. We were well &s;atisfied with his Rea&s;ons, and gave him leave to proceed as he thought fit; and accordingly the next Day he &s;et Sail with tho&s;e Per&s;ons mention'd along with him. And by the Advice of all, we follow'd him, being very well convinc'd by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves, there was nothing of Force to be apprehended. I had fitted up the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of War again, and re&s;olv'd to keep her, and di&s;po&s;e of the Bark. Therefore, a&s;&s;oon as we came within Sight of Land, I order'd every thing to be taken out of her, and put on Board the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who we found was a very good Sailor.</P>
<P>The Day following <HI>Don Pedro</HI> came on Board, with &s;everal Merchants and Per&s;ons of Quality, to treat about the Ran&s;om of the Prize; and we agreed for 1200000 Dollars, after we had taken &s;everal Bales of rich Goods out of her. The Money was to be paid in &s;ix Days, and
<PB N="190" REF="199">
we were to &s;tay where we rode; for I did not much care to tru&s;t 'em too far.</P>
<P>In the mean time we &s;ent all their &s;ick and wounded on Shore. The Bark we di&s;pos'd of for Provi&s;ion, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, and took the Opportunity of waiting for the Money to Water our Ships. At the Time appointed, the Money came, and we &s;urrender'd the Ship to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Now we agreed by joint Con&s;ent to go home, for we were all rich enough, and e|very one of the Crew thought &s;o: Yet we re|&s;olv'd to touch at St. <HI>Salvador</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> (and make our Way through the <HI>Magellan</HI> Straits) as well to take in &s;ome Refre&s;hments, as to di&s;po&s;e of the re&s;t of our Goods, and ca|reen our Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Accordingly we put our De&s;ign in Executi|on, and made the be&s;t of our Way for the Straits of <HI>Magellan,</HI> and di&s;cover'd tho&s;e noted Clouds, which are a &s;ure Guide to Sailors, the third of <HI>May.</HI> We found the Weather ex|treamly cold, and the Mountains cover'd with Snow; but we were well provided with good Liquors, and all convenient Cloathing. We an|chor'd in <HI>Port Famine;</HI> formerly call'd <HI>Knight's Bay,</HI> by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in a Voyage 1598, with a Fleet of five Sail; where meeting with many Troubles, and to eternize the Memory of the Voyage, (it being the fir&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> made to tho&s;e Straits) the Admiral knighted &s;ix of the Officers, by the Title of Knights of the furious Lion. The Oaths they receiv'd at the Cere|mony were, never to do, or con&s;ent to do, any thing again&s;t their Honours, or to prejudice their pre&s;ent Voyage, to expo&s;e their Lives for the Service of their Commonwealth, and to do their utmo&s;t in driving the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from their
<PB N="191" REF="200">
golden World. They were in&s;tall'd on Shore, with a Sea-green Garter, and a Table built, with their Names engrav'd on it.</P>
<P>We &s;aw &s;everal of the Inhabitants, who were ea&s;ily prevail'd upon to come on Board us. But I could find nothing extraordinary in their Height, as is fabulou&s;ly reported. The talle&s;t I could &s;ee among them did not exceed &s;ix Foot. They are certainly a poor mi&s;erable People, but very harmle&s;s; and I am apt to believe all former Stories of their mon&s;trous Height and Cruelty to be Fables.</P>
<P>We got through the Straits once more into the North Sea, and by degrees came into a warmer Climate. But a terrible Storm over|took us, ju&s;t as we were in Sight of <HI>Pepy</HI>'s I&s;land, which drove us within Sight of Port <HI>De&s;ire,</HI> upon the Continent; and therefore we thought it the &s;afe&s;t way to run into the Bay, which accor|dingly we did, and came to an Anchor in &s;even|teen Fathom Water.</P>
<P>At the South Side of the Port, lies <HI>Penguin</HI> I&s;land, &s;o call'd from a multiplicity of tho&s;e Birds re&s;orting there. Our Men went on &s;hore, and in three Hours time brought on board five hundred of the Fowls, and &s;everal thou&s;ands of their Eggs, which prov'd delicious Food. They are call'd <HI>Penguin,</HI> not from their Fatne&s;s, as &s;ome Authors affirm, but from their Whitene&s;s mix'd with black. They are about the bigne&s;s of a Goo&s;e, weighing between nine and fourteen Pound; and tho' their chief Diet is Fi&s;h, yet they have no fi&s;hy Ta&s;te. Their Skin is very thick, their Bill is like that of a Raven, tho' not altogether &s;o crooked; their Neck is &s;hort and thick, and the re&s;t of their Body re&s;embles a Goo&s;e, excepting the Wings, which are only two Stumps cover'd with Feathers, which they make
<PB N="192" REF="201">
U&s;e of in Swimming. Their Feet are black, like tho&s;e of a Swan. They breed in Holes of the Rocks, which are &s;o numerous, there is no walking hardly for fear of falling into them. When they walk on Shore 'tis upright, with their Wings hanging down, &s;o that they appear in that Po&s;ture like &s;mall Pigmies. We &s;taid but two Days here, and then &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e for <HI>Rio Janeiro,</HI> or the River of <HI>January,</HI> intending to touch at St. <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI>'s fir&s;t, and if we did not &s;ucceed there, to &s;ail for St. <HI>Salvador.</HI> When we arriv'd there, the <HI>Portugueze</HI> would not admit us to enter the Bay, but fir'd &s;everal Guns from the Forts laden with Shot, to deter us from anchoring; we could not imagine the meaning of it, but however we left 'em in that Humour, and &s;teer'd for St. <HI>Salvador,</HI> and in one and twenty Days we di&s;cover'd <HI>Praya de Zum|ba,</HI> a Place very ea&s;ily known from a Number of white Spots, which appear like Linnen hung out to whiten, or dry.</P>
<P>We pa&s;t Fort St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> and &s;aluted it with eleven Guns, which return'd us an equal Num|ber, without the charge of Shot, and came to an Anchor within half a League of the City; which we al&s;o &s;aluted with eleven Guns, and receiv'd but &s;even in Return.</P>
<P>By Advice of the Officers, we &s;har'd among the Sailors a thou&s;and Pieces of eight a Man, which pleas'd 'em exceedingly. The next Day, I went to wait on the Governor, who receiv'd me very civilly, and de&s;ir'd I would dine with him. We were very magnificently &s;erv'd, and a Band of <HI>Italian</HI> Mu&s;ic play'd all the while. After Dinner I made my Pre&s;ents, which he ac|cepted of very kindly, but when I came to treat about our Commerce, he flatly deny'd me, tel|ling me it was again&s;t the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s
<PB N="193" REF="202">
expre&s;s Orders, to &s;uffer any Trading with Fo|reigners. I begg'd his Pardon, if it was not to be comply'd with. He would have return'd my Pre&s;ent, but I pre&s;s'd him to accept it in &s;o obliging a manner, that he did; and told me in <HI>French,</HI> that &s;ince he &s;aw my Ge|nero&s;ity, he would comply with me. He im|mediately &s;ent for &s;everal Merchants, and took 'em into his Clo&s;et, where they &s;tay'd &s;ome time. When they came out again, the Governor told me tho&s;e Gentlemen would go on Board, and view our Commodities, and if we could agree, he would be an&s;werable for the Money. One of the Per&s;ons &s;eem'd to be of a more free and open Di&s;po&s;ition than the <HI>Portugueze</HI> generally are. (Tho' mo&s;t of the Inhabitants of St. <HI>Sal|vador</HI> affect the Manners of the <HI>French.)</HI> We &s;oon made an End of our Bargain, and my merry Merchant would oblige me to go a-&s;hore and &s;up with him that Night. He pre&s;s'd me &s;o hear|tily, that I could not refu&s;e him; and according|ly I went with only my two <HI>Indian</HI> Servants, who began to be under&s;tood in <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>When we arriv'd at the Merchant's Hou&s;e, I was &s;urpriz'd to find it &s;o magnificent. He led us into a hand&s;ome Summer-hou&s;e in the Garden, where he told me we were to &s;up; and, &s;aid he, to convince you that you are welcome, I'll bring my Wife and Daughter to keep us Company, which is reckon'd as a thing extraordinary a|mong us. But, added he, I have been in <HI>Eng|land</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and I find the Women are not the le&s;s Hone&s;t, for having their Liberty. I told him, I thought Con&s;traint did but whet their Inventions to gain their De&s;ires. Said he, I am of your Mind, therefore give 'em all the Liberty they de&s;ire, and I can't find I have had any rea&s;on to repent it.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="203">
In a little time he u&s;her'd in the two Ladies, his Wife and Daughter, both very beautiful, and, notwith&s;tanding the Heat of the Climate, very fair. The Wife &s;eem'd about five and thirty, the Daughter about &s;ixteen, and they both &s;poke very good <HI>French.</HI> Our Conver&s;a|tion was kept up with all the Spirit I was ca|pable of: I &s;oon di&s;cover'd a great deal of Wit in them both, and made 'em my Com|pliment in finding Ladies &s;o extraordinary in &s;o remote a Part of the World.</P>
<P>When we had &s;upp'd, the Merchant (who&s;e Name was <HI>Don Jaques)</HI> told me it was his Cu&s;tom to provide Beds for his Gue&s;ts, as well as Supper: And after we had walk'd a Turn or two round the Garden, we all retir'd to our &s;everal Apartments.</P>
<P>The next Morning we drank Chocolate to|gether, and I invited <HI>Don Jaques,</HI> with his Wife and Daughter, to dine with me on Board the next Day, which he con&s;ented to. I now begg'd Leave to be gone; but it being very hot, he had provided me a Silk <HI>Palanquin;</HI> which is a Thing like a Hammock, with a Canopy over it, car|ry'd by two Blacks, with each a Re&s;t to hang it on while they take Breath. This is all the Vehicle in U&s;e at St. <HI>Salvador,</HI> by rea&s;on of the Unevenne&s;s and Steepne&s;s of the Situa|tion.</P>
<P>I prepar'd for them with all the Magnificence I could the next Day. And when they &s;aw the Variety of Di&s;hes, dre&s;s'd after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manner, they were mightily pleas'd; and, to add to their Satisfaction, the Mu&s;ick I had on Board play'd &s;everal elegant Pieces, accom|pany'd with the Trumpet I had got from on Board the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prize, (for notwith&s;tanding his being Trumpeter to the Garri&s;on of <HI>Baldi|via,</HI>
<PB N="195" REF="204">
yet he was better pleas'd to be where he was.) We drank the King of <HI>England,</HI> and the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Health &s;everal times, with the Di&s;charge of our Cannon: And when the Time for their going on Shore came, I fa&s;ten'd a &s;mall Pre&s;ent of &s;everal &s;orts of Silk upon the Wife and Daughter. <HI>Don Jaques</HI> perceiv'd what I was about, and merrily &s;aid, That is not fair; we did not pay you for your Com|pany Ye&s;terday, and yet I believe it was as valuable as that you receiv'd to-day, at lea&s;t in my Opinion; I &s;ha'n't an&s;wer for the La|dies, &s;aid he, they are both capable of &s;peaking for them&s;elves. I receiv'd many Compliments on all Hands; but not dealing much in them, I am very willing to forget 'em.</P>
<P>In a Day or two after <HI>Don Jaques</HI> came on Board, and told me the Money for the Goods was ready, but I &s;hould not have it, unle&s;s I came my &s;elf to receive it. I accordingly went with him, and he made me continue there all Night, where we had the Conver&s;ation of the Ladies as before.</P>
<P>When I was going away the next Day, he told me he &s;hould &s;oon find if any thing el&s;e be&s;ides Money had the Power to bring me to &s;ee him. I told him, to convince him of that, I would come and dine with him the next Day; which accordingly I did. After Dinner I expre&s;s'd a De&s;ire of &s;eeing the mo&s;t remark|able Places in the City, which he comply'd with, and order'd two <HI>Palanquins</HI> to carry us.</P>
<P>The City of St. <HI>Salvador,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Bra|&s;il,</HI> is &s;ituated in the Bay of <HI>All-Saints,</HI> in 12 Degrees 45 Minutes Southern Latitude. It is divided into two Towns, the upper and the lower. The Streets are &s;trait, and pretty broad, but mo&s;t of them very &s;teep; and all the Goods
<PB N="196" REF="205">
are hoi&s;ted in and out of the Ve&s;&s;els by Machines for that purpo&s;e. It was formerly under the Dominion of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but taken from them by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in 1624, and pretty well forti|fy'd by them; yet notwith&s;tanding that, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> retook it the next Year. I could not learn how long the <HI>Portugueze</HI> have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd it, but they all agree upwards of fifty Years. They have made it a regular fortify'd Place, and ve|ry &s;trong; having five Forts be&s;ides the Ca&s;tle, well &s;tor'd with Cannon, and other Ammuni|tion, and &s;mall Arms for ten thou&s;and Men. This is the u&s;ual Seat of the Viceroy of <HI>Bra&s;il&punc;</HI> but when I was there it was without one, tho' he was expected every Day,</P>
<P>The Cathedral is a magnificent Pile of Build|ing, finely adorn'd, and painted after the mo|dern Manner. The <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> Church is a noble Structure, all of <HI>European</HI> Marble; with a fine Organ, the Pipes gilt. There are many more fine Churches, twenty in all, be&s;ides &s;e|veral Convents and Mona&s;teries.</P>
<P>This Place is al&s;o the Re&s;idence of a Bi&s;hop, who has a hand&s;ome Palace; and for the Re|verend the Clergy, I never &s;aw &s;uch a Num|ber for the bigne&s;s of the Place any where, as <HI>Benedictines, Franci&s;cans, Carmelites, Augu&s;tins, Capuchins, Dominicans,</HI> and <HI>Barefoot Fryars;</HI> (tho' I think mo&s;t of the People I &s;aw there wore no Stockings.) There are three Nunneries, well &s;tor'd with Nuns, but not to be &s;een; nor hard|ly any Women in the Town, but common Whores, or black Slaves; for the <HI>Portugueze</HI> lock up their Wives and Daughters as careful|ly as they do their Money, and would have none look upon them but them&s;elves; except my Friend <HI>Don Jaques;</HI> which is &s;omething the more extraordinary.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="206">
It is a Place of great Trade to <HI>Guinea,</HI> and other Parts, and is accounted one of the rich|e&s;t Cities in the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Domini|ons. By moderate Account there may be about 20000 Whites, (or I &s;hould &s;ay <HI>Portugueze,</HI> for they are none of the white&s;t,) and about tre|ble that Number of Slaves.</P>
<P><HI>Don Jaques</HI> would make me take five Days up in viewing the &s;everal Parts of the City, and oblig'd me to be at his Hou&s;e without go|ing on Board during that Time. Some Part of the Day we play'd at <HI>Ombre,</HI> a Game migh|tily in Vogue among the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Por|tugueze,</HI> and a very entertaining Game for three, invented by the jealous <HI>Spaniards</HI> for that Num|ber, to prevent any clande&s;tine Doings between two. But alas! I believe there are more Op|portunities gain'd than lo&s;t by it.</P>
<P>We had provided every thing we wanted now, and began to prepare for our Departure.</P>
<P><HI>Don Jaques</HI> was very &s;orry to lo&s;e me, he told me; and indeed it was with &s;ome Regret I left him; for his Civility had drawn from me a Friend&s;hip in&s;en&s;ibly. I went to take Leave of the Governour, who made me a Pre|&s;ent of <HI>American</HI> Sweetmeats, and begg'd I would dine with him, which I could not in good Manners deny. When Dinner was over, <HI>Don Jaques</HI> was &s;o obligingly pre&s;&s;ing for me to &s;up with him the la&s;t Time, that I could not refu&s;e; but I begg'd he would excu&s;e my &s;taying all Night, and he gave me his Word he would not pre&s;s me. I &s;ent one of my <HI>In|dians</HI> to order the Boat to fetch me at Ten that Evening.</P>
<P>When the time of my Stay was expir'd, I took my Leave of <HI>Don Jaques</HI> and the Fa|mily, after having forc'd him to accept of a
<PB N="198" REF="207">
Gold Watch, and the Ladies a Pre&s;ent of each a Diamond Ring, that I receiv'd from the Go|vernour of <HI>Luconia,</HI> for my Civility in return|ing him his Plate and Jewels, when we took the <HI>Acapulco</HI> Ship in the <HI>South-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Well, &s;aid <HI>Don Jaques,</HI> I &s;ee you will pay for your Board in &s;pight of my Teeth. I had taken Leave of the Wife and Daughter before, who had left us in Tears. I mu&s;t own I thought my &s;elf very much oblig'd for their Tenderne&s;s; and it drew &s;uch a deep Melancholy upon my Face, with Thoughts of my dear Wife, that <HI>Don Jaques</HI> imagin'd it was Grief for parting with him and his Family. I did not take any Pains to undeceive him. Well, &s;aid he, I &s;ee a Friend|&s;hip may be contracted in a few Days, as well as Love, e&s;pecially where there is a Harmony of Souls.</P>
<P>We had agreed to corre&s;pond together, and I had undertaken to &s;end him &s;ome <HI>European</HI> Goods, if it pleas'd God to guard me &s;afe to <HI>Europe.</HI> I had continu'd longer with <HI>Don Ja|ques</HI> than I had intended to do, therefore, whatever Violence I did my &s;elf, I took my Leave. <HI>Don Jaques</HI> tenderly embrac'd me, and was &s;o much overwhelm'd with Grief, that I could not forbear &s;ympathizing with him: But I order'd his Servants, (whom I had liberally rewarded for the Trouble I gave) to &s;hut the Door, to prevent their Ma&s;ter's going any far|ther.</P>
<P>I walk'd towards the Port very melancholy, though with &s;ome Precipitation; but was rouz'd out of it by one of my <HI>Indians</HI> crying, Ma&s;ter, take a Care, take a Care! I turn'd about, and &s;aw four <HI>Portugueze</HI> pur&s;uing us. I made a Stand, and drew my Sword, took my Cloak from my <HI>Indian,</HI> and put it acro&s;s my Arm to
<PB N="199" REF="208">
defend my &s;elf the better. They all four at|tack'd me at once; but my <HI>Indians,</HI> whom I had order'd to wear Swords on Shore, fell upon 'em furiou&s;ly, and di&s;patch'd two of 'em imme|diately; and I had made a &s;hift to drop a third, though not without receiving &s;everal Wounds. The fourth ran for it; but my <HI>Indians</HI> being as nimble-footed as Does, &s;oon overtook him, and dragg'd him down the Hill by the Hair of his Head; while he cry'd out all the while, <HI>Mi&s;e|ricordia! Mi&s;ericordia!</HI> The Noi&s;e we made had brought up my Boat's Crew, who were all arm'd with Pi&s;tols and Cutla&s;&s;es; and the Guard coming in the mean time, and &s;eeing my <HI>Indians</HI> dragging the Fugitive, fell upon us: But my Crew and <HI>Indians</HI> charg'd 'em &s;o furiou&s;ly, that they &s;oon put 'em to Flight, though treble our Number: Though this avail'd us but little, for the whole Garri&s;on was coming down upon us. I then order'd my Crew to re&s;i&s;t no more, but &s;ubmit to 'em; for as we were innocent, I did not much fear to come off clear.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;tle had rouz'd <HI>Don Jaques,</HI> and his Servants, who were &s;oon inform'd of the Con|dition I was in, and he came in good time to in|terpo&s;e his Authority; for the <HI>Portugueze</HI> began to be outragious. But the Governour had &s;ent a Gentleman to bring us before him: And ac|cordingly I went, accompanied by <HI>Don Jaques.</HI> But the Wounds I had received bled &s;o much, that they were oblig'd to carry me to <HI>Don Jaques</HI>'s, and &s;end for a Surgeon. My Hurts were not dangerous, but I was very faint with Lo&s;s of Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Don Jaques</HI> waited on the Governour, and in|form'd him of the Condition I was in: But the Governour not under&s;tanding who was the Aggre&s;&s;or, order'd a Guard of Soldiers at the
<PB N="200" REF="209">
Door of the Hou&s;e where I was. My Boat's Crew &s;oon got on Board, and alarm'd both the Ships, who immediately weigh'd and came clo&s;e to Shore, where they had prepar'd to fire upon the Town, if I was not releas'd in|&s;tantly. I under&s;tanding the Matter, &s;ent one to inform them, that the Guard was &s;et upon me to &s;ecure me from the In&s;ults of the <HI>Por|tugueze,</HI> till the Truth of the Matter was di&s;|covered. This would not &s;erve their Turn, but a hundred of 'em, with the Officers and <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> landed, all well arm'd, and vow'd to wait the Event on Shore. The Governour did me the Honour of a Vi&s;it, and enquir'd into the Cau&s;e; and I inform'd him, as well as my Weak|ne&s;s would permit me. When they had exa|min'd the dead <HI>Portugueze,</HI> they found one of them was Nephew to the deceas'd Viceroy. Upon the Di&s;covery of which, the <HI>Portugueze</HI> began to be very much exa&s;perated, and were hardly re&s;train'd from ru&s;hing into the Hou&s;e, and tearing me to Pieces; for though they did not regard the Nephew, yet they had a great Veneration for his deceas'd Uncle, who behav'd him&s;elf with a great deal of Candour in his Po&s;t, and the Inhabitants mightily regretted his Lo&s;s. The Governour appeas'd their Fury, by telling 'em I &s;hould have no Favour &s;hewn me if I were guilty, let the Con&s;equence be what it would. And immediately a Court was &s;ummon'd to try me, tho' it was Midnight, and I was carry'd there in a <HI>Palanquin,</HI> weak as I was. But I was oblig'd to &s;end for my Lieutenant, and tell him that there was no Dan|ger; and al&s;o order'd him to &s;end the Crew on Board again. When we came to the Place of Ju&s;tice, the Governour order'd me a Seat: But the Bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;oon ended; for the <HI>Por|tugueze</HI>
<PB N="201" REF="210">
we had &s;ecur'd, own'd that his Ma&s;ter had de&s;ign'd to murder me, becau&s;e he was inform'd I was his Rival in the beautiful <HI>Donna Bianca,</HI> (which was the Daughter of <HI>Don Jaques.)</HI> I was very much &s;urpris'd (as well as <HI>Don Ja|ques)</HI> at this Report, and we both declar'd it was only a jealous Sugge&s;tion of the Gentleman; which every one came into: And the Grounds he had for it, was my often frequenting <HI>Don Jaques</HI>'s Hou&s;e, upon the &s;core of Friend&s;hip only, and lodging there.</P>
<P>The Governor hand&s;omely di&s;mi&s;t me, and told me he was very &s;orry I had been detain'd from my Affairs. I return'd, that I was as &s;orry to be the Cau&s;e of &s;o unhappy an Accident, in a Country where I had receiv'd &s;o much Civility.</P>
<P><HI>Don Jaques</HI> begg'd I would go back to his Hou&s;e, and &s;tay till my Wounds were well; but the Governour took us a&s;ide, and &s;aid to us in <HI>French,</HI> I know, <HI>Don Jaques,</HI> 'tis your Friend&s;hip for the Captain that makes you de|&s;ire his Company; but, if I might advi&s;e you, I would have him go on Board upon the In|&s;tant; for though he is very innocent as to the Matter, yet I doubt &s;ome of the Decea&s;ed's Friends or Relations, which are numerous, not having Regard to Ju&s;tice, will contrive &s;ome Method to di&s;patch him out of the Way: for mo&s;t of the <HI>Portugueze</HI> are jealous, malicious, and revengeful, and very &s;eldom look into the Merits of the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I thank'd the Governour for his kind Cau|tion; and <HI>Don Jaques,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his Friend|&s;hip, could not but come into what he had &s;aid. I therefore order'd my &s;elf to be carried on Board that Moment. It being broad Day, the Governour and his Guard would accompa|ny me to the Water-&s;ide, but <HI>Don Jaques</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="211">
would go on Board with me. In the Boat he told me he had &s;ome Thoughts of coming to re&s;ide in <HI>England,</HI> for, &s;aid he, I have enough, and therefore I will, in two or three Years more, leave off Traffick and live quiet in the World. But he begg'd I would write to him a&s;&s;oon as I arriv'd in <HI>Europe,</HI> and let him know the Place I had cho&s;e to live in; for, added he, let it be where it will, if it is ever my For|tune to arrive &s;afe in <HI>Europe,</HI> I'll take another Voyage only for the Hopes of &s;eeing you. I re|turn'd him the Acknowledgment due to &s;o much Friend&s;hip, and we parted with Tears on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as I had got on Board, the Wind being fair, we weigh'd and &s;tood out of the Bay. When we were out at Sea, a Letter was brought me written in <HI>French,</HI> the Tran&s;|lation of which is as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Was re&s;olv'd to make Tryal of you before I &s;uf|fer'd my Heart to chu&s;e you for a Friend&punc; and I am &s;o well convinc'd of the Sincerity of your Soul, that I will confide in you a Secret dear to my Repo&s;e. I had an Amour with a beautiful Lady before I was marry'd, that produc'd the Bear|er of this Letter. I have kept him conceal'd from my Family hitherto; but the Per&s;on I tru&s;ted with his Education and this Secret, being dead, I fear'd I &s;hould find &s;ome Difficulty to conceal him any longer here: Therefore, depending upon your good Nature and Friend&s;hip, I have ventur'd to &s;end him to you, with Sufficient to bear his Expences in his Education, which I would have &s;uitable to the E|&s;tate I have in my Power to give him. I &s;hall

<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your &s;incere Friend and Servant, Jaques de Ramires.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I mu&s;t own I was very much &s;urpriz'd at this Epi&s;tle, and could not imagine his Rea&s;ons for concealing it from me. I order'd the Per|&s;on that brought the Letter to be conducted in, and immediately enter'd my Cabin one of the beautifulle&s;t Boys I had ever &s;et my Eyes on. He &s;eem'd about Fifteen, his Hair fair and long, curling down his Shoulders: In &s;hort, every Feature &s;o exact and uniform, and &s;o innocent withal, that I was amaz'd. At la&s;t I took him by the Hand and embrac'd him, and told him for his Father's &s;ake he &s;hould be as dear to me as my own Son. But finding he did not an&s;wer me, for I &s;poke to him in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I re|peated the &s;ame in <HI>French.</HI> He return'd me Thanks, and &s;aid he did not doubt but he &s;hould find it &s;o.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, he deliver'd me a Casket, in which were Jewels to the Value of five thou&s;and Pi&s;toles, and a little Box which con|tain'd a thou&s;and Moidores. I told him I would take as much Care of them as if they were my own.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, &s;aid the Youth, are de&s;ign'd to bear my Charges. Then ordering another Box in, had it open'd, and told me what it con|tain'd was a Pre&s;ent from his Father to me. When I examin'd it, I found &s;ix Silver Di&s;hes, and three dozen of Plates of the &s;ame Metal; a dozen of Knives, Forks, and Spoons in Gold, and half a dozen of Gold Sweet-meat Plates
<PB N="204" REF="213">
In a larger Box was variety of all manner of Con&s;erves and Cordials; and I was informed he had made &s;mall Pre&s;ents to every Officer in the Ship, and to the common Sailors a Week's fre&s;h Provi&s;ion, with Liquor in proportion. I was amaz'd at his Bounty, for his Pre&s;ent to me was what a Prince might have receiv'd. I thought it was my Duty to &s;hew all the Kindne&s;s I was capable of to the Son of &s;o generous a Fa|ther; therefore I order'd him a Field-Bed in my own Cabin; and his Behaviour was &s;o en|gaging, that I felt as much Tenderne&s;s for him as if he had really been my own Child; and having Skill in Surgery, I tru&s;ted him with the Management of my Wounds; though I had a very good Ship-Surgeon, who &s;upply'd him with what he wanted. My Hurts, which were not dangerous, &s;oon heal'd, and I recover'd my Strength again. I could not prevail upon young <HI>Don Ferdinand, (Don Jaques</HI>'s Son) to go often upon Deck. He &s;aid he would rather chu&s;e to &s;tay in the Cabin, where he had <HI>French</HI> Books of his own, and &s;ome of mine to entertain him; for I had taken my Opportunity to procure &s;e|veral at St. <HI>Salvador,</HI> and among the re&s;t a <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Grammar and Dictionary, which mightily pleas'd <HI>Don Ferdinand,</HI> for he had a great De&s;ire to learn <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> I gave him all the Helps I could; and he in return, in&s;tructed me in the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Language; &s;o that in a &s;hort time we could di&s;cour&s;e in either.</P>
<P>We had re&s;olv'd to &s;teer our Cour&s;e for the I&s;land of <HI>Tercera,</HI> the Capital of the <HI>Azores;</HI> and af|ter fifty Days Sail, we di&s;cover'd the Peak of one of the I&s;lands of <HI>Azores,</HI> which is called <HI>Pico,</HI> from the Mountain. It is in the Re&s;em|blance of a Pyramid, and may be di&s;covered as many Leagues off as the <HI>Pike of Teneriff;</HI> for
<PB N="205" REF="214">
we were then by Ob&s;ervation thirty Leagues off from it, and yet could &s;ee it di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>In two Days more we di&s;cover'd the I&s;land of St. <HI>Michael.</HI> We were all pleas'd that we had en|ter'd that Part of the World we call <HI>Europe,</HI> the Birth-place of mo&s;t of us; and what pleas'd us more was, that we had made all our Fortunes.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 19th, 1696, we anchor'd in the Bay of <HI>Angra,</HI> the Capital of the <HI>Azores,</HI> in the I&s;land <HI>Tercera.</HI> I can't give any great Com|mendation to the Port, being I think it a very indifferent one. We did not de&s;ign to &s;tay long, only to get &s;ome Water, and &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;ions; for we were inform'd there was no riding out a Storm there. We got in what we wanted with all Expedition we could, while the Weather was favourable.</P>
<P>The City is &s;eated at the Bottom of the Bay, under the Brow of a Hill call'd <HI>Monto de Bra&s;il,</HI> or the <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> Mountain; but for what rea&s;on &s;o call'd, I could not be inform'd. It is very well fortify'd, having two &s;trong Ca&s;tles, and eight Batteries be&s;ides, with Guns of thirty Pounds Shot. But it is very indifferently garri&s;on'd, having no more than two hundred Men in Pay, and mo&s;t wretchedly &s;upply'd, having no cloath|ing for three Years.</P>
<P>The Town is very agreeable, having a Stream of Water running quite through it, which drives &s;everal Miles for the U&s;e of the Publick; and almo&s;t in every Quarter are publick Fountains of excellent ta&s;ted Water. From this Place are brought the fine&s;t Canary-Birds, tho' le&s;s than tho&s;e of the <HI>Canaries,</HI> yet they exceed 'em far in the Excellency of their Pipes.</P>
<P>Money is very &s;carce here, and con&s;equently every thing cheap. I bought two Months Bi&s;|cuit for the Ships, much cheaper than in any

Port of <HI>Europe.</HI> Corn is their chief Commo|dity, which they &s;end to <HI>Portugal;</HI> but for any other Trade, I believe the King of <HI>Portu|gal</HI> gets but little Advantage.</P>
<P>I was grown &s;uch a Proficient in the <HI>Portu|gueze</HI> Tongue, that I could make a &s;hift to be under&s;tood; and by under&s;tanding that Language, &s;oon found a Gate to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Tongue, by the help of <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> who had learnt to &s;peak <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> very fluently. We got acquainted with one of the Fathers of the <HI>Cordeliers,</HI> who &s;hew'd us the Churches, and other things of Note in the City. The Cathedral is a very hand&s;ome Building, and well painted, which goes by the Name of St. <HI>Salvador;</HI> and there is no danger of mi&s;&s;ing that Title, and St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> every where among the <HI>Portugueze.</HI> There's no le&s;s than twenty, be&s;ides the Cathedral; with four Mona&s;teries, and four Convents, that have each their Chapel beautifully adorn'd. When we had got what Refre&s;hments were wanting, we &s;et &s;ail for the <HI>Straits,</HI> intending to touch no where, before we were got into the <HI>Mediterra|nean;</HI> and becau&s;e we met with nothing extra|ordinary in our Voyage to <HI>Gibralter;</HI> I will, to divert the Reader, give him, (in&s;tead of Bearing of Coa&s;ts, Changes of Wind, and unexpected Storms,) the Life of my Companion <HI>Don Pedro Aquilio;</HI> which he related to us during the Voyage, in the following Manner.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF <HI>Don PEDRO AQUILIO.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_MY Father re&s;iding in <HI>France,</HI> when the Commotions were ingendring be|tween the King and the Parliament, was made fa&s;t to the Intere&s;t of Car|dinal <HI>De Retz,</HI> by marrying one of his Neices of a very great Fortune: He had a Hand in mo&s;t of the &s;ecret Tran&s;actions of tho&s;e Times; and wading too deep in tho&s;e Seas of Trouble, was obliged to retire to his native Country. He fore&s;eeing what would happen, took care of his Affairs accordingly; &s;old his E&s;tate in <HI>France,</HI> and &s;ent my Mother to <HI>Sevil,</HI> the Place of his Birth, whither he &s;oon follow'd. The King of <HI>Spain,</HI> having a very great Regard for him, gave him &s;everal Offices of Honour and Pro&s;it; and when I was born, I was Son to the fir&s;t Man in the City. My Father, by living &s;o long in <HI>France,</HI> had contracted the Manners of the <HI>French;</HI> and the Formality of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;eem'd as &s;trange to him, as if he had been born in another Climate. He had &s;everal Children,
<PB N="208" REF="217">
tho' none &s;urviv'd but my &s;elf. When I had Years enough over my Head to fear the Preju|dice of Education, he took a Re&s;olution of &s;end|ing me to the College of the four Nations in <HI>Paris,</HI> to compleat my Studies. And the fir&s;t thing I learnt, was to &s;hake off all the Cu&s;toms of <HI>Spain,</HI> which was &s;oon done; for they had taken but &s;mall Impre&s;&s;ion in my Mind, becau&s;e I found my Father was aver&s;e to 'em. I con|tracted a Friend&s;hip with &s;everal young <HI>French</HI> Noblemen of my own Age; for Parity of Years is the fir&s;t Step to Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>When I had reach'd my fifteenth Year, I be|gan to think of a Mi&s;tre&s;s, to compleat my Stu|dies. And as I found it was a Method among my Companions, to &s;upplant each other in their Females without any Animo&s;ity, I &s;et my &s;elf &s;o willingly about it, that out of half a dozen <HI>Madonas,</HI> I made my &s;elf Ma&s;ter of &s;ix of 'em. This occa&s;ion'd many Plots and Contrivances to regain the flying Fair Ones: Tho' I perceiv'd mo&s;t Money laid out in Pre&s;ents had a prevailing Force with 'em. We had our Allowance paid quar|terly, and getting all my Companions into ga|ming, I had the good Fortune to &s;trip 'em all. They &s;eem'd to be a little unea&s;y, in lo&s;ing their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es and Money too; and my telling 'em, as I had got the Females, I &s;hould have the mo&s;t occa&s;ion for the Money, &s;ignify'd nothing, but they all begg'd it as a great Favour, that I would lend 'em half what I had won, to be re|paid the next Quarter; which to oblige 'em, I comply'd with, and to play we fell again; but Fortune chang'd her amiable Looks from me, and I &s;oon lo&s;t all I had won, with my own Share too. The fickle Dame favour'd one of the Com|pany, that would not lend any of us a Penny. This chagrin'd the re&s;t very much. But to pre|vent
<PB N="209" REF="218">
any more Importunity, he went away to his own Chamber, leaving room in all our Pock|ets for the Devil to dance a Saraband, for we had not one Cro&s;s to keep him out; and what was our greate&s;t Mortification, the Holydays were approaching, that us'd to give us the Op|portunity of rambling into the Country. The Per&s;on that won our Money, happen'd to be the la&s;t that was added to our Society; and tho' he had not been long among us, we began to be tir'd of him, as much from his odd Humours, as his Ef|feminacy. I at la&s;t thought of a Project to be reveng'd on him, and it was very much approv'd by the re&s;t of my Companions. The Holydays being come, we de&s;ign'd for our Country Ren|dezvous; but he that bore the Pur&s;e would not go with us, without we could produce every one &s;o much Money. This put us to our Shifts again: But my Man, who was an arch Wag, begg'd that I would accept of what he had; for I had been &s;o lucky as to have paid him his Wa|ges, before my Lo&s;s. I accepted of his Offer, and took from him ten <HI>Lewis d'Ors:</HI> We contriv'd it &s;o well, that they were &s;hown to old Sir Snip, from every Per&s;on of our Society. Well, &s;aid he, &s;ixty <HI>Lewis d'Ors</HI> will do our Bu&s;ine&s;s; but who &s;hould be Pur&s;e-bearer was what he cavil'd at; and not caring to tru&s;t any of us, (and we re|&s;olv'd not to tru&s;t him) he pitch'd upon my Man to be Ca&s;h-keeper for us all. And accor|dingly he put down in his Pocket-book, &s;o much Money in Bank, receiv'd of &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons, when in reality he had but twenty <HI>Lewis d'Ors.</HI></P>
<P>When we had contriv'd every thing, we took Hor&s;e, and rode &s;ix Leagues that Evening, to the Place where we de&s;ign'd to put in Execu|tion our Project. We had agreed to pay every
<PB N="210" REF="219">
Night the Expences of the Day, and have it &s;et down in my Man's Book. But when he was call'd for (as we had concerted) no Man was to be found. There was &s;trange Enquiry made to no purpo&s;e; and we all agreed he had taken the Opportunity to rob us, and run away with our Money. All that we had to do, was to beg of Snip to di&s;charge the Hou&s;e. But he declar'd he had not half a Pi&s;tole in his Pocket: which we knew very well, for he had &s;ew'd all the re&s;t into his Wa&s;tecoat. Since it falls out &s;o unluckily, &s;aid I, don't let us make known our Wants to the Hou&s;e, but go to re&s;t, and con&s;ult to-morrow. I lay with Snip, for fear he &s;hould take it into his Head to &s;neak off. In the Night, when I found he was fa&s;t a-&s;leep, I bundled up all his Cloaths, and threw them out of the Window to my Man that waited for them.</P>
<P>When Morning came, I de&s;ir'd him to ri&s;e, that we might get all together to con&s;ult; but no Cloaths were to be found. He began to &s;torm, and &s;wear, but all to no purpo&s;e; for not one of his Oaths would bring back a Rag of his Cloaths. He told us in his Ravings, that he had lo&s;t &s;o much Money, &s;ew'd up in his Wa&s;tecoat. We upbraided him for his Covetou&s;|ne&s;s, in not letting us &s;hare with him; but it did not &s;ignifie any thing. He threaten'd to go to the <HI>Provo&s;t,</HI> and have the Landlord &s;ecur'd; and would have don't, if he had not been naked.</P>
<P>After raving to no Purpo&s;e, he was oblig'd to go to Bed again to avoid catching cold. He ask'd us what he &s;hould do in his Condition, but all the Advice we gave him brought him no Con&s;olation.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="220">
He was very tall, and large made, and we us'd to call him in Ridicule the <HI>Infant.</HI> He pro|pos'd to &s;ell his Hor&s;e to cloath him; but be|ing &s;o much out of Size, there was not any thing to be had ready made that would fit him: This was &s;till wor&s;e and wor&s;e; and tho' the Hor&s;e was &s;old for twenty <HI>Pi&s;toles,</HI> we contriv'd it &s;o, that my Landlord &s;eiz'd the Money for his Reckoning. This put him almo&s;t be&s;ide him&s;elf, and he was ready to expire with Vexation.</P>
<P>I pretended to be much concern'd at this U&s;age, while the re&s;t of our Company laugh'd at his Misfortune. I &s;eem'd to be very angry with them; and told 'em I would do my Endea|vour to remedy every thing. I made 'em ac|quainted, that I had ju&s;t call'd to mind a Per&s;on, a Friend of mine, that liv'd in the Town, much of the Infant's Size, and I would go to borrow a Suit of Cloaths for him. He &s;eem'd very much rejoyc'd at this; for he re&s;olv'd, a&s;&s;oon as ever he was dre&s;s'd, to take up the <HI>Landlord,</HI> and &s;wear the Robbery again&s;t him.</P>
<P>I went as he &s;uppos'd about his Cloaths; and after &s;taying &s;ome time below, I went up with a Bundle, and &s;eem'd very much concern'd that I could not &s;ucceed. I told the <HI>Infant,</HI> the Gen|tleman was gone to <HI>Lyons</HI> about Bu&s;ine&s;s of Con|cern, and had carry'd all his Cloaths with him. But I had brought him a Ma&s;querade Habit that he had left behind him.</P>
<P>He expre&s;s'd &s;ome Satisfaction at the Sight of it, that he &s;hould not be confin'd to lie in Bed. But, &s;aid he, if it were not only for the Name of Cloaths, a Man might as well go naked, for there's no &s;tirring abroad in this Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>It was the Habit of a Satyr, that we had made on purpo&s;e for the Occa&s;ion, before we left <HI>Paris.</HI> When we had equip'd him, it was as much as I
<PB N="212" REF="221">
could do to keep my Countenance at the Figure he made; and he &s;eem'd very much di&s;&s;atisfy'd with it, but however he wore it for the Convenien|cy of not lying in Bed.</P>
<P>When we were at Dinner, we had many Contrivances to get away, but none feazable.</P>
<P>I told 'em at la&s;t, I had thought of a De&s;ign would certainly do our Bu&s;ine&s;s, and make up our Lo&s;&s;es, if the <HI>Infant</HI> would con&s;ent to it. He readily reply'd, he would &s;tick at nothing to do that. Why then, &s;aid I, if you'll &s;uffer your &s;elf to be &s;hown in that Habit, as a Mon&s;ter newly arriv'd, I'll an&s;wer for the Succe&s;s of it.</P>
<P>After much talk, he agreed to do it, on this Provi&s;o, that his Face &s;hould be di&s;guis'd. I told him, I would &s;tep to my Friend's Hou&s;e, for the Mask that was made to the Habit. I return'd and gave it to him, and he was &s;oon &s;atisfy'd with the Project.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Bu&s;tle we made, none of the Hou&s;e (but the Landlord) knew any thing of the Matter, and the next Day it was given out about the Town, that a Mon&s;ter was to be &s;hown in the Afternoon. We had procur'd a Chain, and other Materials, to carry on the Joke; and when the time came to &s;how a|way, we had &s;uch a Concour&s;e of People to &s;ee our Mon&s;ter (it being in the Holydays) that our Profit gave us &s;ome Satisfaction. For when the time of &s;howing was over, our Money a|mounted to three and twenty <HI>Pi&s;toles;</HI> and the Mon&s;ter behav'd him&s;elf &s;o well with our In|&s;tructions, that he gave a general Content.</P>
<P>We had taken care he &s;hould appear &s;o fierce, that none &s;hould approach near enough to di&s;|cover the Deceit. We had a great deal of Di|ver&s;ion at the ignorant People's Sugge&s;tions. One Country Fellow ask'd how old he was? I told
<PB N="213" REF="222">
him four Years, three Months, and five Days. Lord ble&s;s me! (cry'd he out) why, by that time he comes to be twenty, no Hou&s;e will be able to hold him.</P>
<P>In fine, we &s;how'd him &s;o long, that our Money mounted to upwards of one hundred Pounds, which pleas'd our <HI>Infant</HI> &s;o well, that he de&s;ir'd to continue a Mon&s;ter all the time of the Holydays. But we re&s;olv'd to carry the Joke no further, tho' we did not tell him &s;o.</P>
<P>We left the <HI>Infant</HI> chain'd to the Po&s;t of the Window, as u&s;ual, went down to my Landlord, and gave him In&s;tructions how to behave him|&s;elf. We took care to &s;atisfy him very well for the Trouble he had been at.</P>
<P>We all rid away to the next Village, and put|ting up our Hor&s;es, return'd on Foot, one by one, back again to the Inn; and &s;tole up Stairs unperceiv'd by any one but the Landlord. The <HI>Infant,</HI> finding we &s;taid longer than ordinary, began to make a great Noi&s;e: which my Land|lord hearing, &s;ent up one of his Servants, that knew nothing of the Secret; when the <HI>Infant</HI> &s;aw him come in, he made &s;everal Signs to him; but as the Fellow knew nothing of the Je&s;t, he did not much like the Action of the <HI>Infant,</HI> but ran down to his Ma&s;ter frighted out of his Wits.</P>
<P>We had made Peep-holes in the bordering Room, where we could perceive every Action of the <HI>Infant</HI>'s; but he was &s;o very much enrag'd, that he &s;at down biting his Nails for Vexation; for he began to perceive the Trick we had put upon him. After &s;itting Melancholy &s;ome time, he ro&s;e up, and endeavour'd to undo the Chains; but as they were ty'd clo&s;e behind, and made fa&s;t to a Staple in the Wall, all his Efforts prov'd vain. All our care was to contain from laugh|ing,
<PB N="214" REF="223">
which was a very hard Task. When he found he could not free him&s;elf, Rage entirely po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him; and the Noi&s;e he made with &s;tamping, and rattling his Chains, brought up &s;everal of the Servants arm'd, who open'd the Door cautiou&s;ly; but notwith&s;tanding their Va|lour, ran away a&s;&s;oon as they perceiv'd his me|nacing Action; and tumbling over one another, took the &s;horte&s;t way down Stairs.</P>
<P>When we thought he had Mortification e|nough, we &s;ent my Landlord into him with a good Hor&s;ewhip, and a Letter in his Hand. A&s;|&s;oon as he had got within the Door, he &s;poke after this manner, in a Landlord-like Tone. I was pretty well a&s;&s;ur'd at the beginning that thou wert a rank Cheat; but now I am con|vinc'd of it, I will cha&s;ti&s;e thee fir&s;t, and rea&s;on with thee afterwards, like other criminal Judges, puni&s;h fir&s;t, and enquire into the Demerits of the Cau&s;e afterwards, that Ju&s;tice may not wait for any body.</P>
<P>The&s;e Words were follow'd with &s;ome &s;mart Strokes, and the Dialogue &s;oon began to be in much Confu&s;ion; for between the roaring of the Infant, the bawling of my Landlord, and the &s;macking of the Whip, it was a continual jar|gon of Noi&s;e: And we were obliged all of us to own, our Ho&s;t executed his Commi&s;&s;ion to a Hair.</P>
<P>When he had a little recover'd him&s;elf, he be|gan to rea&s;on with his Patient; who, that he might the better hear him, laid him&s;elf down on his Pallate to condole his afflicted Body. But their Que&s;tions being very long, and the An|&s;wers but &s;hort, con&s;i&s;ting of two Mono&s;yllables, Ay, or No, I will not trouble you with the Re|lation.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="224">
After their Dialogue was over, he gave him the Letter, which di&s;covered our De&s;ign upon him. He was thunder-&s;truck at our Combination; and utter'd &s;uch Imprecations of Revenge, that my Landlord was oblig'd to an&s;wer him with his Whip, which &s;oon reduc'd him to Rea|&s;on.</P>
<P>We began to be tir'd with our <HI>Infant,</HI> and &s;o put an end to our Diver&s;ion, and his Tor|ture, by &s;ending him his Cloaths; tho' &s;ome of our Company would have had him gone to <HI>Pa|ris</HI> in that Trim.</P>
<P>In a few Days after the Frolick was over, he commenc'd a Suit of Law again&s;t us all, for a Robbery; but the Judges finding it only a Trick of Mirth, fined every one of the De|fendants &s;ix Livres a-piece, and every one to pay his own Co&s;ts. This but enrag'd the <HI>In|fant</HI> the more, and he began to meditate a more pernicious Revenge; for now he appear'd the Ridicule of the whole City, and he could ne|ver &s;tir without a Train of Boys at his Heels.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t In&s;tance of it was as follows: My Servant having &s;ome Intrigue on his Hands, had made bold with my Cloaths to carry it on; and coming home pretty late, was &s;hot thro' the Back with a Pi&s;tol Ball, ju&s;t as he was ent|ring the College Gates. Though it was well meant, the poor Fellow e&s;cap'd with Life, yet he lay dangerou&s;ly ill for &s;everal Days. He could give no Account of the Affair at all, not ha|ving &s;een the Per&s;on that wounded him. But the Accident made me very unea&s;ie, for I was convinc'd the Favour was meant to me. This made me cautious how I ventur'd out of the College; for it was ea&s;ie to imagine it was a Proof of the <HI>Infant</HI>'s Re&s;entment, who had left the College upon the lo&s;s of his Tryal.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="225">
I began now to repent our Confederacy a|gain&s;t him, and wrote him a Note to a&s;&s;ure him of my Contrition, with my Share of the Money we had taken from him. He receiv'd the Ca&s;h, and &s;ent me Word he heartily for|gave me. Imagining him &s;incere, I ventur'd into the City, and &s;oon frequented my old Ren|dezvous; but I had &s;o much Regard for my &s;elf as to get to College betimes.</P>
<P>One Night as I was going home, four Men in Vizor Masks ru&s;h'd out from behind a Wall of a Hou&s;e that was building; They all fir'd up|on me, and ran away a&s;&s;oon as they had di&s;|charg'd their Pieces. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, at fir&s;t Fear made me imagine my &s;elf no Man of this World: But by degrees getting over my Ap|prehen&s;ion, I found I had not got any Hurt. This Accident to me &s;eem'd prodigious; for they were all four &s;o near me, that &s;everal Grains of the Powder &s;tuck in my Face. But I was brought out of my Labyrinth of Thought, when I receiv'd the following Letter the next Morning.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Mu&s;t own my &s;elf one of tho&s;e unfortunate Men, that, for want of better Employment, receive Money as the Price of Blood. Though this I can &s;ay with a clear Con&s;cience, I never have yet put my Trade in Practice. Ye&s;terday Morning I was &s;ent for to the Hou&s;e of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Gomberville,</HI> commonly call'd the <HI>Infant,</HI> who employed me to take away your Life; and, that he would be &s;ure of the Execution, made one of the four that fir'd upon you la&s;t Night; but as I had the order|ing of our Arms, I took care nothing &s;hould be put in 'em that was hurtful. The Acquaintance I had with your noble Father, made me the more cau|tious
<PB N="217" REF="226">
concerning his Son. I beg in Ju&s;tice to me you would keep your Chamber, and cau&s;e it to be reported that you are dangerou&s;ly wounded. I need not caution you to be careful of your &s;elf, for the <HI>Infant</HI>'s Malice &s;eems to me implacable. We never have any Words made of the&s;e Things, becau&s;e we know how to revenge our &s;elves; therefore let no one el&s;e know the Contents of this, and be thank|ful for your Life from</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Jaques Marriot.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>When I had read the Letter, I order'd my Servant to bring the Bearer before me; where I &s;oon found, by his manner of Talking, that a little Money would be very acceptable to the Sender; and therefore I &s;ent him ten Pi&s;toles, with my humble Service, giving him to know that I would exactly comply with the Con|tents.</P>
<P>I began now &s;eriou&s;ly to think on the Dan|ger I had incon&s;iderately drawn upon my &s;elf, for an innocent Frolick; and that it would be but ill tru&s;ting to the <HI>Infant</HI>'s Re&s;entment. I gave out that I was dangerou&s;ly wounded; and the better to carry it on, I got a Sur|geon (a Friend of mine) to vi&s;it me frequently.</P>
<P>When I had kept my Chamber long enough for the time of my Cure, I ventur'd abroad, but never without four or five of my Friends for a Guard, and came home in very good Time.</P>
<P>During my Confinement, I receiv'd Letters of Condolement from &s;everal of my Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; and when they heard of my Recovery, as many of Reproach for not coming to vi&s;it them as u&s;ual. One in particular, and my favourite Fair, was very pre&s;&s;ing for a Meeting; and her chief Rea&s;on was to pay her with my Pre&s;ence for the Affronts &s;he had &s;u&s;tain'd from the <HI>Infant</HI>
<PB N="218" REF="227">
upon my Account. I &s;ent her Word I would not fail waiting on her the <HI>Sunday</HI> following, after Dusk. Accordingly when the time came, I &s;tole out without any of the College Marks on, and arriv'd &s;afe at my <HI>Madona</HI>'s.</P>
<P>After Supper, and two or three Bottles of <HI>Hermitage,</HI> we went to Bed; and when we had made our &s;elves as merry as we could in the dark, I addre&s;s'd my &s;elf to Sleep: But not|with&s;tanding my willingne&s;s to receive the gen|tle God, he &s;till flew from me, and &s;everal Hours pa&s;s'd without clo&s;ing my Eyes.</P>
<P>About Midnight, I thought I heard Whi&s;pers in the next Room, which very much alarm'd me: But my Fears were trebly increas'd, when, looking through a Chink of the Door, I di&s;|cover'd the <HI>Infant,</HI> and four other Fellows with Masks in their Hands, &s;preading Saw-du&s;t on the Floor, and on the Table lay &s;everal Sacks.</P>
<P>I &s;oon imagin'd what their Preparations meant, therefore con&s;ulted my Safety as well as I could in the Confu&s;ion of my Thoughts.</P>
<P>I went always well arm'd &s;ince the la&s;t Ren|counter, having two Brace of Pi&s;tols in my Pockets, a good cutting Sword, and a Stilletto. But I was confounded, when &s;earching for my Cloaths where I had laid them, none could be found. I now began to think of Death &s;eriou&s;|ly, and beg Pardon &s;incerely of God for all my Sins; for I knew it would be Madne&s;s to think of e&s;caping, naked as I was, without a|ny Thing for my Defnce. In the Chaos of my Thoughts I remembred a Clo&s;et which had a Window that look'd into the <HI>Seine;</HI> and tho' it was three Stories from the River, yet, as I could &s;wim, I thought it better to tru&s;t Pro|vidence by leaping into the Water, than tho&s;e Cut-throats. I &s;tole &s;oftly to the Window,
<PB N="219" REF="228">
but to my great Con&s;ternation found it too fa&s;t for me to open; but by good Fortune in gro|ping about, I found my Cloaths. I put 'em on with a great deal of Precipitation, and having prepar'd my Arms, re&s;olv'd not to die alone.</P>
<P>I waited &s;ome Time before the Chamber Door open'd. When it was open, I could perceive 'em coming in with Masks on, and the foremo&s;t with a Dark-lanthorn. I did not think fit to wait till they &s;hould di&s;cover I was not in the Bed, but ru&s;h'd on the fir&s;t, and &s;hot him dead on the Spot; and in two &s;econds of a Minute, di&s;patch'd two more, one&punc; with my Sword, and the other with one of my Pi&s;tols; and had made as quick work with the other two, but they fell on their Knees, and begg'd for Mer|cy; which I granted, on Condition that one &s;hould tye the other, which was readily com|ply'd with; when that was done, I bound the other my &s;elf, and coming to &s;ecure my fal&s;e Mi&s;tre&s;s, found her expiring in the Bed. She had Breath enough left to tell me, &s;he had been caught in her own Trap; for de&s;igning to poi|&s;on me in the Wine I drank, the Servant had mi&s;taken the Bottle, and given it to her.</P>
<P>I ask'd her the Rea&s;on of her Hatred to me, being, as I remember'd, guilty of no Fault. She told me, the <HI>Infant</HI> had inform'd her that I was fal&s;e to her, which converted her Love to the mo&s;t implacable Hatred. I mu&s;t own, this Wo|man was Mi&s;tre&s;s of my Heart, and I had &s;eve|ral Proofs of her Sincerity; but &s;he was of a Temper compos'd of Fire and Fury. She fur|ther told me, that I had rais'd her Rage to that height, that &s;he was re&s;olv'd to put an end to my Life her &s;elf; not caring to tru&s;t her Re|venge to any Hands but her own.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="229">
She begg'd I would forgive her, and imme|diately expired. I examin'd my two intended Murderers, and found they were Servants to the <HI>Infant,</HI> and compell'd to what they did; there|fore I re&s;olv'd to pardon 'em.</P>
<P>I thought once of going to the Provo&s;t, and give him a particular Account of the Action; but one of the Fellows inform'd me, he was a near Relation of the <HI>Infant</HI>'s, and had a very great Love for him, which made me apprehend his Pa&s;&s;ion would overcome his Ju&s;tice. There|fore I re&s;olv'd the next Morning to &s;et out for <HI>Spain,</HI> which I put in practice before Day, and gave my Man Orders to follow me.</P>
<P>I left <HI>Paris</HI> with this Reflection, that from the meane&s;t triffling Accident, often dreadful Effects follow'd; and a Woman once provok'd was the mo&s;t dangerous Enemy a Man could have.</P>
<P>I met with nothing extraordinary in my Voyage to <HI>Cales;</HI> but when I arriv'd at <HI>Sevil,</HI> I was inform'd, my Father, who was Governor of that City, was at his Country-hou&s;e about &s;ix Leagues off.</P>
<P>Tho' I was very much fatigu'd with my Jour|ney, I re&s;olv'd to wait on him that Night. I hir'd a Mule (for I had my Servant's Cloaths on) and &s;et out. But my Bea&s;t being none of the be&s;t, tir'd with me about a League before I came to the Villa where my Father re&s;ided.</P>
<P>I left him in the adjacent Village, and pur&s;u'd my Journey on Foot. As I was willing to get to my Father's Hou&s;e, I made all the Speed I could. And tho' it was very dark, I knew the Way perfectly.</P>
<P>I overtook two Men in a narrow Lane, that call'd to me, asking why I had &s;tay'd &s;o long, and where was <HI>Don Lewis.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="230">
I fancy'd there was &s;omething of Villany go|ing forward by the Name of Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> being he was an inveterate Enemy of my Father's. I did not an&s;wer 'em immediately, which brought 'em upon me; they &s;oon found their Mi&s;take. They ask'd me where I was going at that time of Night; I told 'em I was going to <HI>Saragoza,</HI> to my Friends, for I had &s;erv'd a Gentleman in <HI>Cadiz,</HI> that had di&s;charg'd me, for getting his Maid with Child; and I was obliged to walk all Night, being I had not any Money to pay for a Lodging. I an&s;wer'd a great many other Que&s;tions, with the &s;ame Truth and Simplicity. And after talking &s;ome time, two more came up to us, and ask'd the others who they had got with 'em. They went all together, and after a little talk, one that &s;eem'd to be the Superior, came up to me, and told me, if I would make one of their Enterprize that Night, he would not only reward me well, but take me into his Service; but if I refus'd after he had di&s;clos'd it to me, they would murder me upon the In|&s;tant.</P>
<P>I told him I would &s;tick at nothing to get Bread. Why then, &s;aid Sir Gravity, my Name is Don <HI>Lewis:</HI> I have a mortal hatred to <HI>Ferdi|nand Aquilio,</HI> Governor of <HI>Sevil.</HI> I have waited many Years for my Revenge, but never could get an Opportunity to execute it till now. He has re|ceiv'd one of my Servants into his Hou&s;e as a Dome&s;tic, who this Night will open the Door to us, where I &s;hall quench my Hatred of him with his Blood; and further, to di&s;patch all fear of Re&s;i&s;tance, I can a&s;&s;ure you there are but two more Servants in the Hou&s;e, whom my Fellow has made drunk, which &s;hall be order'd &s;o, as if they had murder'd their Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="231">
It was well for me that Darkne&s;s cover'd the Hemi&s;phere, or the old Devil could have di&s;co|ver'd the Confu&s;ion in my Countenance. But notwith&s;tanding my Con&s;ternation, I told him I &s;hould be proud to &s;erve him in this, or any o|ther Adventure. Gramercy, &s;aid the old One, and here's &s;omething to encourage thee, (clap|ping a handful of Dollars into my Hand.)</P>
<P>I'll leave you to gue&s;s the Confu&s;ion of my Thoughts at this Declaration, and I was ca&s;ting about in my Mind, how I &s;hould prevent this intended Villany.</P>
<P>When we arriv'd at my Father's, we found the Treacherous Villain wating for his Ma&s;ter. A&s;&s;oon as ever he &s;aw us, he cry'd &s;oftly to Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> I am glad your Honour is come; but Don <HI>Ferdinand</HI> is in his Clo&s;et, and does not intend to go to Bed to-night, becau&s;e he is to be at <HI>Sevil</HI> early in the Morning, and he has &s;hut his Clo&s;et|door. Why then, &s;aid Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> we'll break it open. But, return'd the Servant, he has Arms always ready in his Clo&s;et, and I fear the En|terprize will be a little Difficult, for he's a tough old Blade.</P>
<P>Upon this Account a &s;mall Pau&s;e en&s;u'd, which gave me Lei&s;ure to think, and to the Old one I utter'd my Thoughts.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, &s;ubmit this Bu&s;ine&s;s to me, and I'll inform you how I de&s;ign to execute it. Your Servant &s;hall accompany me to the Door of his Clo&s;et; and knock, and a&s;&s;oon as ever he opens it, I'll give a good Account of the old Gentle|man.</P>
<P>Thou coun&s;elle&s;t well, reply'd the old Don, and I'll reward thee accordingly when the Work is done. And I &s;hall de&s;erve it, thought I to my &s;elf, if my Intention &s;ucceeds.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="232">
Upon this Re&s;olve, we went into the Hou&s;e, and the Fellow conducted me up Stairs very &s;oftly. The Clo&s;et was at the end of a large Room, the Door of which I bolted on the In|&s;ide with one Hand, and plung'd my Ponyard to the Heart of the Fellow with the other, who drop'd dead at my Feet. At the Noi&s;e he made in falling, my Father cry'd out Who's there! and ru&s;h'd out of his Clo&s;et, with a Pi|&s;tol in his Hand. I reply'd, 'Tis I, your Son.</P>
<P>You may imagine the Surprize my Father was in at this &s;udden Appearance, and to &s;ee one of his Servants weltring in Blood, and dead before me. Sir, &s;aid I, bani&s;h your Surprize, and go with me into your Clo&s;et, where I will inform you of this &s;udden, and unlook'd-for Appearance; and mu&s;t farther add, that the Hand of Providence, by me, has &s;av'd you from Death.</P>
<P>My Father follow'd me into his Study, with|out &s;peaking: Where I declar'd, in as few Words as the Time would permit. all that had befallen me that Night; and we &s;oon came to a Re&s;olution what to do.</P>
<P>We took each of us a Blunderbu&s;s with a brace of Pi&s;tols, went down the back Stairs, and came in upon 'em, a way they little expected. I came fir&s;t into the Hall, as we had con|certed.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as the old Wretch &s;aw me, he cry'd, Well my Lad, ha&s;t thou di&s;patch'd the Villain! Yes Sir, &s;aid I, and have drag'd him down that you may behold what I have done. When he heard that, he gave a Leap for Joy, and came running forward to view the plea&s;ing Sight. But Words cannot expre&s;s his Looks, when he &s;aw my Father confronting him with a Bluderbu&s;s in his Hand. He &s;tood motionle&s;s, as if he had been turn'd to Stone.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="233">
The other three endeavour'd to make their E&s;cape, but I di&s;charg'd my Blunderbu&s;s, and &s;topt two of them with my ha&s;ty Me&s;&s;engers. The Report of my Piece made <HI>Don Lewis</HI> fall down, as imagining him&s;elf &s;lain; the third Per&s;on finding it impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape, became de&s;perate, and like a Stag at Bay defy'd us. He pull'd out a Stilletto, and ran upon me like an angry Lyon, and notwith&s;tanding I &s;hot him in the Brea&s;t with a Brace of Balls, wound|ed me in three &s;everal Places; I grappling with him, we came down together upon the Body of <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> who with our Weight be|gan to cry out; and that Moment had been the la&s;t of my Life, if my Father had not ran to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and with his Sword nail'd my Antagoni&s;t to the Pavement.</P>
<P>The Report of our Fire-Arms had waken'd the two drunken Servants of my Father, who came half frighten'd out of their Sen&s;es. By this time <HI>Don Lewis</HI> had recover'd him&s;elf, and &s;ee|ing Death before him, fell down upon his Knees, and implor'd my Father's Mercy.</P>
<P>Thou ba&s;e Man! reply'd my Father, how can&s;t thou expect to live after thy barbarous Attempt upon his Life that never wrong'd thee? He told him he did not expect to be forgiven, on|ly to be allow'd a Prie&s;t, and Confe&s;&s;ion, and he would die with a hearty Penitence for his Sins.</P>
<P>Wretch! cry'd my Father, thou may'&s;t &s;ee how Heaven abhors thy Fact, by bla&s;ting thy De&s;ign. This Man thou &s;ee&s;t before thee, whom thou did&s;t employ in thy black De&s;ign, is my own Son, who&s;e coming hither was like an Angel &s;ent from Heaven to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance. I &s;ee, return'd the <HI>Don,</HI> the Seal of Providence is upon you, and I heartily repent the Crime I
<PB N="225" REF="234">
intended to commit: And if you will forgive me, and forget what is pa&s;t, I'll e&s;teem you as the Saver of my Life; and, to unite our Friend|&s;hip, I'll match my Daughter with a noble Dowry to this your Son, and may they ever live happy.</P>
<P>My Father was too much a Gentleman to murder in cold Blood, though he had &s;ufficient Excu&s;e on his &s;ide if he had done it. On the other hand, his Daughter was a very great For|tune, even beyond his Hopes.</P>
<P>After &s;ome &s;mall Pau&s;e, he made him this Reply. Sir, you know within your &s;elf, that you have forfeited your Life by the Law, in &s;o ba&s;ely attempting mine; but as I can forgive any Injury de&s;ign'd me, if you perform your fir&s;t Promi&s;e, I am re&s;olv'd to forgive all that's pa&s;t. Sir, reply'd the other (tran&s;ported with Joy) I am &s;o much oblig'd to you for my Life, that I will not &s;tir out of your Hou&s;e till I have &s;ign'd Articles of Agreement; and I mu&s;t farther add, that nothing &s;ets my Shame more before my Eyes than this your Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>My Father begg'd he would take a particu|lar Care how he gave way to Hatred; which, by the way, only commenc'd in my Father's getting the better of him in a Law-Suit, and was heighten'd by the King's conferring on him the Honour of the Government of <HI>Sevil,</HI> which <HI>Don Lovis</HI> had &s;ome Hopes of.</P>
<P>We took care the next Day to let the Coun|try know, that tho&s;e Fellows that were kill'd had attempted to rob our Hou&s;e, but we ha|ving timely Notice had prevented 'em by their Deaths.</P>
<P>The old Gentleman was as good as his Word, for Articles of Agreement were drawn up be|tween
<PB N="226" REF="235">
'em, and I had Leave to vi&s;it the Lady when I thought fit. But I was obliged to go back to <HI>Sevil,</HI> to put my &s;elf in an Equipage &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion, and <HI>Don Lewis</HI> fol|low'd after with his Daughter.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was charm'd with her Per|&s;on at the fir&s;t Interview; and the Day was fix'd for our Nuptials, which rejoic'd the whole City of <HI>Sevil,</HI> that two of the noble&s;t Hou&s;es were going to bury in Oblivion their long En|mity.</P>
<P>I took the Privilege of an intended Husband in my Vi&s;its to my de&s;ign'd Bride, and in her Conver&s;ation found &s;he had no Aver&s;ion for me, (at lea&s;t I thought &s;o,) and I promis'd my &s;elf the utmo&s;t Felicity in her Enjoyment.</P>
<P>One Morning, about a Week before the inten|ded Wedding, I came early to wait on her, but was inform'd &s;he was not come out of her Chamber: therefore I re&s;olv'd to take a Walk in the great Piazza of the City, to give her time to dre&s;s her &s;elf; but as I was going out, I ob&s;erv'd the Maid to my Mi&s;tre&s;s conferring with a Country Fellow; the Sight of me, I ob&s;erv'd, gave the Woman &s;ome Confu&s;ion. My Heart told me I was concern'd in their Interview, therefore I went to the Corner of the Street, and waited till their Dialogue was over; which did not keep me long, for the Fellow &s;oon parted with the Woman, and went out of the Gate that leads to <HI>Cordova.</HI></P>
<P>I had my Man with me, whom I acquainted with my Fears, ordering him to dog the Fellow, and get out of him, by fair Means or foul, his Bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Don Lewis</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and I would follow after him on Hor&s;e-back.</P>
<P>Away ran my Man, and I &s;oon got my Hor&s;e, and overtook 'em about a League and a half
<PB N="227" REF="236">
from <HI>Sevil.</HI> When my Man got Sight of me, I ob&s;erv'd he took a little Basket from the Countryman, and ran away over the Fields with it. I fancy'd by that he had &s;ucceeded in his Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;o turn'd my Hor&s;e and follow'd him.</P>
<P>When I had overtaken him, we went be|hind a Tuft of Trees a little out of the Road, where he told me he had made the Fellow be|lieve he was &s;ent by <HI>Tere&s;a</HI> (the Name of the Maid he was conferring with) to give him No|tice that he would be pur&s;u'd by a Cavalier, and forc'd to deliver what he had receiv'd from her, and perhaps be in Danger of lo&s;ing his Life; and that he had Orders to con&s;ult with him for his Safety.</P>
<P>The Countryman, being none of the wi&s;e&s;t, &s;oon di&s;covered the whole Affair to my Man, and at Sight of me deliver'd the Basket to him, and ran to a publick Hou&s;e in the next Village, to wait till he could get clear of me, where my Man was to bring him his Basket again. In the Basket were four Melons, and in one of them we found a Letter very artificially put up, which I took out, and with Terror of Mind read the Con|tents, which were as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>LIfe of my Life, and Trea&s;ure of my Soul! I receiv'd yours, which gave me all the Con&s;o|lation my di&s;con&s;olate Heart was capable of recei|ving.

</LETTER>
<P>I was Thunder&s;truck at the reading of this Let|ter, yet ble&s;t my providential Stars that guided me to this black Secret, before the Prie&s;t had join'd our Hands. And, tho' a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> my Re&s;entment did not ri&s;e to Jealou&s;y, but my Fancy ran upon the Enjoyment of this fal&s;e Fair-one, without the Marriage Chain. And what prompted me the more to it, was, a Po&s;t&s;cript to her Letter, wherein &s;he bad him come in his u&s;ual Di&s;gui&s;e, and in the dark. In order to the Accompli&s;hment of my De&s;ign, I went into a neighbouring Hou&s;e, and wrote the following Letter, which was put in the Melon in the Room of the other.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Now all the Hopes I had were, that the Fellow knew what Di&s;gui&s;e this amorous Spark wore, and where was the Place of Rendez|vous.</P>
<P>I left it all to my Servant, who had Cun|ning enough to outwit twenty of the Coun|tryman. After I had deliver'd him his Commi&s;|&s;ion, I went back to <HI>Sevil,</HI> full of Hopes and
<PB N="229" REF="238">
Fears; and in two Hours my Man arriv'd: He gave me a De&s;cription of his Conver&s;e with the Countryman, (which was diverting enough) and how happy they were in e&s;caping my Hands.</P>
<P>He inform'd me, the amorous Gallant came di&s;guis'd in the Habit of a Pea&s;ant, and was ad|mitted through the back Garden of <HI>Don Lewis</HI>'s Hou&s;e by the Maid, who always attended the Hour, and convey'd him to her Apartment in the Dark; which was according to my Wi&s;h: and by De&s;cription of the Spark's Per&s;on, we were not unlike as to Proportion or Age, and Darkne&s;s would conceal the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;oon provided my &s;elf of the Habit I was to wear, and impatiently expected the coming Hour, which came at la&s;t, though the inter|vening ones &s;eem'd the longe&s;t of my Life.</P>
<P>I did not wait long before I was admitted by the too-faithful Confident. We went over the Garden to a &s;mall Room at the Entrance of the Hou&s;e, where I &s;oon di&s;cover'd my fal&s;e Fair-one, (tho' in the dark.) She was undre&s;s'd, and di&s;incumber'd of every Lett to Enjoyment. I found, by her eager Ki&s;&s;es and Embraces, there was no Parlying requir'd; &s;o I e'en fell to and fed very heartily; my Partner in Plea&s;ure &s;eem'd to like what was prepar'd for her; and, before we parted, gave me to under&s;tand I had done Wonders, and much beyond her Expecta|tion.</P>
<P>When we had dally'd away about four Hours in our Fea&s;ting, the Maid came to tell me it was time to part, which we did, after &s;natch|ing another Mor&s;el.</P>
<P>I went immediately home, was &s;oon in Bed, and had no want of any Provocative to Sleep.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="239">
When I aro&s;e in the Morning, I began to weigh maturely the la&s;t Night's Adventure; but could come to no Re&s;olution as to the for|ming my Behaviour to my fal&s;e Mi&s;tre&s;s: But I re&s;olv'd to be determin'd by hers.</P>
<P>I went to vi&s;it her about Noon, and found her more than ordinary civil to me.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I was &s;o charm'd with the Sight of her, that I re&s;olv'd to give her another Vi&s;it in my Di&s;gui&s;e the &s;ame Night; and all I had to do was to be fir&s;t at the Place.</P>
<P>When the Time came, my Conductre&s;s was as ready as before; but going &s;oftly in, &s;he clapt to the Door a little too ha&s;tily, and fa&s;ten'd my Coat in't; and to give me the more Unea|&s;ine&s;s, &s;he the &s;ame Moment dropt the Key out of her Hand; and though I could &s;ee where it lay, yet I could not &s;toop for it, becau&s;e my Coat was &s;ecur'd in the Door.</P>
<P>After groping about &s;ome time, &s;he took it up, and open'd the Door to relea&s;e her Pri&s;o|ner: But on the very In&s;tant my Rival appear'd, and, finding him&s;elf there before he came, ru&s;h'd in, and fa&s;ten'd upon me.</P>
<P>The Maid, at the Sight of two <HI>Sofia's,</HI> clapt to the Door in a Fright, and ran &s;creaming away; &s;o we had the Happine&s;s to be lock'd in the Garden together. But however, to make the be&s;t of a bad Market, (as the Saying is,) I got my Rival down, and belabour'd him with my Fi&s;ts; for, as good Fortune would have it, we had neither of us any offen&s;ive Weapons.</P>
<P>The Noi&s;e of the Maid, and our bu&s;tling, a|larm'd an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ma&s;tiff that was Watchman to the Hou&s;e, who, without &s;aying <HI>By your Leave,</HI> had the Impudence to fa&s;ten upon my Rival by the Arm, and worry'd him very hand|&s;omely: But, notwith&s;tanding my Rea&s;ons to the
<PB N="231" REF="240">
contrary, I took Pity of him, and by Force of Arms de&s;troy'd the Dog; that is, I held him &s;o fa&s;t about the Throat with my Hands, that his la&s;t Breath flew away in a Huff.</P>
<P>My di&s;guis'd Spark &s;eeing him&s;elf &s;o unex|pectedly reliev'd, gave me Thanks for his Safe|ty; and, a&s;&s;oon as ever he &s;poke, (for we had been &s;ullen before, neither of us having open'd our Lips) I knew him by his Tongue to be one of my particular Acquaintance.</P>
<P>Why how now, <HI>Don Juan!</HI> &s;aid I, how came you thus di&s;guis'd? Nay, reply'd the <HI>Don,</HI> I ought to ask you the &s;ame thing. With &s;everal Que&s;tions and An&s;wers we came to a right Under&s;tanding. If I had known, &s;aid he, your Preten&s;ions here, I &s;hould never have made any Attempts to your Prejudice. Come, come, &s;aid I, it's very well as it is. So we turn'd that to Mirth and Ridicule, which perhaps others of our Nation would have turn'd to Blood. Our next thing was to make our E&s;cape, for the whole Hou&s;e was alarm'd, and coming upon us with their dome&s;tick Weapons, as Pokers, Spits, Fire-&s;hovels, &amp;c. My Companion led me to a Place of the Garden, where the Wall was &s;omething lower than any where el&s;e; and ju&s;t as we had gain'd the A&s;cent, we perceiv'd a Man mounting from the other Side; but my Friend did him the Favour to tumble him down again; he quickly got up, and ran upon him mo&s;t furiou&s;ly with his Poniard, and gave him &s;everal Stabs; but my Friend clos'd with him, wre&s;ted his Weapon from him, and &s;tabb'd him to the Heart.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as he was &s;ped, we made off; but did not go far before my Companion dropt down dead of his Wounds. I was very much griev'd at the Accident, but made the be&s;t of my way
<PB N="232" REF="241">
home, for fear I &s;hould come into Trouble about it, if I was caught near the dead Bo|dies.</P>
<P>I went to Bed, but very much perplex'd in Mind, and had no Re&s;t all Night. But what was my Grief in the Morning, when my Ser|vant brought me Word, my Father and <HI>Don Juan</HI> my Friend were found murder'd, in the Habits of Pea&s;ants, under <HI>Don Lewis</HI>'s Garden-Wall! The Relation depriv'd me of the U&s;e of Speech for &s;ome time, and my Rea&s;on for|&s;ook me. I was more than once going to put an End to my Life, and had certainly done it if I had not been prevented by my faithful Ser|vant. But when my Rea&s;on return'd again, I be|gan to think of the Adventure with &s;ome Calm|ne&s;s; for though I had all the Grief imagina|ble for the Lo&s;s of &s;o good a Father, yet I was of a Temper not to grieve long at any thing; and then the Fortune I thought my &s;elf Ma|&s;ter of, appear'd &s;o lovely to me, that it &s;oon dry'd up my Tears.</P>
<P>The City imagin'd my Father came by his Death through <HI>Don Lewis</HI>'s Means, as remem|bring the antient Enmity of the two Hou&s;es; and being found &s;o near his Hou&s;e, &s;trengthen'd the Opinion of every Body; and I was the on|ly Per&s;on &s;atisfy'd to the contrary.</P>
<P>The Servants that brought in my Father's Body, gave me &s;everal Papers found in his Pock|ets; among which were two Letters that partly let me into the Truth of this unhappy Adventure. The fir&s;t was to this Purpo&s;e;</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur Genero&s;ity has prevail'd, and I can no lon|ger with&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd your Offers, (on the Condition as you promi&s;e in your la&s;t, that you will break off the
<PB N="233" REF="242">
Match between your Son, and my Lady.) You mu&s;t pro|vide your &s;elf of a Pea&s;ant's Habit, and to-morrow I will &s;end you a Note to in&s;truct you farther.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours, &amp;c. Tere&s;a.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The Second was as follows.</P>
<P>BE at the We&s;t End of the Garden at one in the Morning, and a&s;cend a Ladder of Rope you will find there, and bring it over with you; near the Corner you'll perceive an Arbour, go in there, and wait till I come to conduct you to your Wi&s;hes. I'll take care nothing &s;hall be in your way to interrupt your Privacy; and be &s;ure you be careful of your Tongue, for if you &s;peak, we &s;hall be both undone.</P>
<P>My Thoughts were in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion about the unravelling of this fatal Affair; and run|ning over in my Imagination my pa&s;t Conver|&s;ations with my Father, I remember'd in our la&s;t, he told me, he thought it a little of the &s;oone&s;t for me to marry; and that it would be more for my Intere&s;t, to delay our Nuptials; and perhaps, &s;aid he, I may give you &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons for the contrary. Whatever his Rea|&s;ons were, I little thought of the true one.</P>
<P>I &s;ent a Letter to the Maid of my fal&s;e Mi|&s;tre&s;s; but &s;he fearing &s;he &s;hould be found out (as &s;he really was) ab&s;conded.</P>
<P><HI>Don Lewis</HI> &s;ent to condole with me in my great Lo&s;s; but I could perceive it gave him &s;ome Satisfaction, that I was in actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that E&s;tate, which I had only Hopes of in the Life of my Father. His Vi&s;it was but &s;hort, yet I thought it too long; for as I had no De&s;ign of
<PB N="234" REF="243">
marrying the Daughter, I was very willing to drop my Acquaintance with the Father. Tho' I gave him Hopes, when Decency would per|mit, I would not fail in my Addre&s;&s;es to his Daughter.</P>
<P>After the Interment of my Father, I began to examine his Affairs, and was not very well pleas'd to find the be&s;t Part of his E&s;tate mort|gag'd for twelve Years to &s;everal Per&s;ons; and in&s;tead of &s;eeing my &s;elf worth twenty thou&s;and Crowns a Year, &s;oon found I was not worth the &s;ixth Part.</P>
<P>It was agreed, that my Father was very pro|fu&s;e in his way of Living, always keeping open Hou&s;e; yet it was every body's Opinion he did not expend half his Income.</P>
<P>I &s;ometimes imagin'd there was &s;ome under|hand Dealing in the Affair, but it was pa&s;t my finding out: I therefore took an odd Re&s;o|lution, I determin'd with my &s;elf to under|go a voluntary Bani&s;hment, till the term of Years on the Mortgage was expir'd.</P>
<P>I made a Vi&s;it to <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> and told him of my Re&s;olves, and my Rea&s;ons for it, which he could not chu&s;e but applaud; for it was ea&s;y enough to perceive Intere&s;t was the Jack he aim'd at. He did not pre&s;s me to &s;ee his Daugh|ter, nor I him; but after A&s;&s;urance of remem|brancing on both &s;ides, we parted.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, my Soul long'd for another Ta&s;te of the delicious Banquet; and I hope you will excu&s;e me when I own to you, my Pa&s;&s;ion could not be call'd Love; but as I found it im|practicable, I made my &s;elf as ea&s;y as I could.</P>
<P>In a few Weeks I had fini&s;h'd my Affairs, and waited for the &s;ailing of the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Fleet; re&s;olving for the City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> where I had an Uncle very rich, who had often ex|pre&s;s'd
<PB N="235" REF="244">
in his Letters to my Father, the great De&s;ire he had to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>I had rais'd out of the Ruins of my Father's Fortune &s;ix thou&s;and Crowns, without &s;o much as touching any of his Plate, or Furniture; the care of tho&s;e Things, with all my Writings, I tru&s;ted to a near Kin&s;man, Superior of a Mona|&s;tery in the City.</P>
<P>One Day, going about two Leagues out of Town, my Hor&s;e's Girt broke, which obliged me to a light at a Sadler's to have it made good. The Man ask'd me if I would not take a walk in his Garden while he was doing his Work, which I accordingly did.</P>
<P>At the end of the Walk was a pretty Arbour, and in it &s;at a Woman reading; who at the Sight of me, gave a great Shriek, and was for running out; but I &s;topp'd her, and begging Pardon for di&s;turbing her, told her I would retire, and leave her alone. But upon finding it was <HI>Tere&s;a,</HI> Maid to my quondam Mi&s;tre&s;s, I re&s;olv'd to &s;tay with her, that I might know &s;omething of my Father's Affair.</P>
<P>She appear'd confounded at the Sight of me, is imagining I had come on purpo&s;e to appre|hend her; but I &s;oon undeceiv'd her, and with a little &s;oothing Language, and a couple of Pi&s;toles, &s;he di&s;pos'd her &s;elf to give me all the information &s;he could.</P>
<P>Sir, (&s;aid &s;he) I hope you will pardon me; for what I did, was purely by the Influence of Gold.</P>
<P>Your Father declar'd to me, at fir&s;t Sight of my Mi&s;tre&s;s his Heart and Rea&s;on for&s;ook him; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd often inform'd me, if he could not enjoy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">er, he &s;hould be obliged to put an end to his Mi&s;ery by Death. I often lay'd before him the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">njury he would do to you his Son, but he as
<PB N="236" REF="245">
often declar'd he would break off the Match between you; for he was well a&s;&s;ur'd you had no very violent Inclination for her, and there were other Women in <HI>Sevil,</HI> of as great a For|tune as my Mi&s;tre&s;s, that would be proud of his Alliance.</P>
<P>The many rich Pre&s;ents he made me, over|came my Hone&s;ty; and that unfortunate Night that brought him his Death, was to have com|pleated his Happine&s;s. But, &s;aid &s;he, (after &s;ome Pau&s;e) I am very much at a lo&s;s to find out one thing. What's that, Madam? &s;aid I. Why, Sir, return'd <HI>Madona,</HI> &s;ince I know how Matters &s;tand between you and my Mi&s;tre&s;s, I &s;hall give you to under&s;tand, that you were not the fa|vour'd Lover; and that another Gentleman re|vell'd in tho&s;e Delights, you perhaps thought to have the whole Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; and that was the Rea&s;on I was &s;o willing to comply with your Father, for I had intended to introduce him in the Habit of the &s;aid Gentleman, unknown to my Mi&s;tre&s;s, and had provided a Story accor|dingly. For a&s;&s;oon as ever the Gentleman was gone, your Father &s;hould have taken his Place in the &s;ame Di&s;gui&s;e; and I intended to impo&s;e on my Mi&s;tre&s;s, that her Lover was return'd to take another Farewel of her. And this Cheat was ea&s;y to be carry'd on, being they were ob|liged to Silence, old <HI>Don Louis</HI> lodging in the next Room. But what amazes me, (as I was &s;aying) opening the Door to let my Mi&s;tre&s;s's Lover in, another in the &s;ame Di&s;gui&s;e ru&s;h'd in upon me, which I am &s;ure was not your Fa|ther. I &s;oon clear'd up this Affair with her, and let her know how I had &s;upplanted my Rival.</P>
<P>She &s;eem'd very much &s;urpriz'd at the unravel|ling of this Secret, but was very glad &s;he had nothing to apprehend from my Re&s;entments; be|ing
<PB N="237" REF="246">
that was the chief Cau&s;e of leaving her Mi|&s;tre&s;s, as imagining I &s;hould find the Letters &s;he had &s;ent him. And upon this &s;he re&s;olv'd to go to her Mi&s;tre&s;s again, for &s;he heard every Day from the Family, and knew how Matters &s;tood; and that her Mi&s;tre&s;s wanted her, that they might condole together for the lo&s;s of <HI>Don Juan,</HI> her old Spark. But &s;he declar'd, &s;he was not very &s;orry for his Lo&s;s, for Mony came very hard from him; and you know Sir, &s;aid &s;he, it is our Bu&s;ine&s;s to make Hay while the Sun &s;hines.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid I, &s;ince I know what you love be&s;t, if you'll pur&s;ue my Intrigue, twenty Pi|&s;toles are at your Service. Indeed, Sir, return'd Madam, it mu&s;t be &s;omething very extraordi|nary that I &s;hall refu&s;e for &s;uch a Sum. Why then I'll let you into my Plot, &s;aid I; you &s;hall inform your Mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>Don Juan</HI> is not Dead, as was re|ported; but after a tedious and dangerous Ill|ne&s;s, was recover'd to a Miracle, but conceal'd his Revival, being under &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion of an&s;wering for the Life of my Father.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I like your Plot &s;o well that I'll an&s;wer for the Succe&s;s on't, and I'll go a|bout it in&s;tantly, for I long to be fingering the Gold. Why then, &s;aid I, you &s;hall finger it before-hand, and when the Bu&s;ine&s;s is done, I'll double the Sum. She was mightily pleas'd with the Amendment to the Bargain; and the third Night after was concluded on for the Time, when I was to attend as before.</P>
<P>I took leave of <HI>Tere&s;a,</HI> and pur&s;u'd my Jour|ney, made merry with my Friends, and re|turn'd.</P>
<P>At length the happy Moment came, that I &s;o long expected. My mercenary Confident was rea|dy; I enter'd, and once more took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all my Trea&s;ure; and as I thought it would be the
<PB N="238" REF="247">
la&s;t time, was profu&s;e enough. My Lady &s;eem'd very well pleas'd with my Night's Work, and in plain Terms told me &s;o.</P>
<P>I had prepar'd a Letter, in which I had di&s;|clos'd every thing. When our loving Affair was over, &s;he ask'd me &s;oftly how I was engaged in that Adventure. I told her as &s;oftly as I could, that I knew &s;he would be inqui&s;itive, and talk|ing being dangerous, I had brought the Account in Writing, which I put into her Hand, and with &s;ome regret took my Leave; for the next Day was intended for our Imbarkation. As I walk'd over the Garden, I ask'd <HI>Tere&s;a,</HI> how long the Amour had been between <HI>Don Juan</HI> and her Lady; &s;he told me about two Years, and this was the Commencement.</P>
<P><HI>Don Juan,</HI> who&s;e Country-hou&s;e lay about two Leagues from my Ma&s;ter's, was &s;et upon by Thieves, and dangerou&s;ly wounded; and there had lo&s;t his Life, if <HI>Don Lewis</HI> had not very fortunately for him come that Way at|tended, and drove off the Thieves. <HI>Don Juan</HI> was &s;o very much hurt, that it was not thought &s;afe to carry him home; therefore my Ma&s;ter order'd him to his Hou&s;e, where his Wounds kept him a great while. When he had recover'd Strength enough to walk, he u&s;ually employ'd his time in the Garden, where my Lady often &s;eeing him, fell de&s;perately in Love with him. She made me the Confident of her infant Pa&s;|&s;ion, and I being a very proper Per&s;on to be tru&s;ted with &s;uch Secrets, advis'd her to let the <HI>Don</HI> &s;ee her, which we contriv'd thus.</P>
<P>She was to go into an Arbour at the farther end of the Garden, (where I had ob&s;erv'd <HI>Don Juan</HI> &s;at every Day) and pretend to be a&s;leep. She took all the care that was nece&s;&s;ary in her Dre&s;s, and did as I directed her. It &s;ucceeded
<PB N="239" REF="248">
to her Wi&s;h; for the <HI>Don,</HI> at Sight of her, ima|gining her an earthly Godde&s;s, kneel'd and ki&s;s'd her Hand. She &s;eem'd to wake in a pretended Fright, but it was not long before they came to a right Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>That Place was made the Rendezvous of the Lovers, when Opportunity would permit; but he recovering (tho' he pretended a Weakne&s;s for &s;ome time) was obliged to take leave of our Hou&s;e; tho' in the Father's Ab&s;ence, they often found Opportunity to &s;atisfy their Loves; and when they re&s;ided in Town, he continu'd his Vi&s;its in the Di&s;gui&s;e of the Countryman he us'd to &s;end to my Lady with Pre&s;ents of Fruit, and by that means they received Letters from each other.</P>
<P>When &s;he had fini&s;h'd her &s;hort Relation, I gave her the tewnty Pi&s;toles I promis'd her, and took my Leave. She &s;eem'd to be in &s;ome Con|fu&s;ion about managing it with her Mi&s;tre&s;s, for &s;he would certainly find her out, &s;he &s;aid, when &s;he would be confirm'd of <HI>Don Juan</HI>'s Death; but &s;he comforted her &s;elf with telling me, her Mi&s;tre&s;s dur&s;t not di&s;clo&s;e it to any body, for fear of betraying her&s;elf. But poor <HI>Tere&s;a</HI> little thought her Mi&s;tre&s;s would find it out &s;o &s;oon as the next Morning, when &s;he had read my Letter, that I put into her Hand, when I left her. The next Day, I order'd my Equipage on board our Ship, which lay at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and fol|low'd my &s;elf; but the Wind chopping about, hinder'd our &s;etting Sail. I then repented the leaving my Letter with my Mi&s;tre&s;s, for by the help of my Money with <HI>Tere&s;a,</HI> I might have made another Meal with her.</P>
<P>I old not think it Prudence to go on Shore, fearing her Re&s;entments might form &s;ome De|&s;igns on my Life. I therefore contented my &s;elf
<PB N="240" REF="249">
on Board, till the Wind &s;hould prove fair for &s;ailing. As I was reading in my Cabin one Day alone, my Servant brought me a Letter: The Contents were the&s;e.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Noble Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNder&s;tanding you are bound for <HI>Mexico,</HI> the Place of my Birth, I &s;hall think it the great|e&s;t Honour in the World, if you plea&s;e to take me into your Protection. My Father was a rich Mer|chant of that City, who going to another World, has left me a con&s;iderable E&s;tate in this. Tho&s;e Per&s;ons who had the care of my Education here, &s;eem to have De&s;igns again&s;t my Fortune; therefore I have made my E&s;cape from 'em, but mu&s;t return to my Betrayers, if you have not the Goodne&s;s to be my Guardian to <HI>Mexico,</HI> where I &s;hall return the Ob|ligation you &s;hall plea&s;e to lay me under, in being my Protector.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>I ask'd my Man who brought the Letter, and he told me a young Negro. I bid him bring him in. I ask'd him &s;everal Que&s;tions, and found him ready with his An&s;wers. He inform'd me, that his Father, tho' a Negro, was a Man of Sub&s;tance, and had &s;ent him in his Infancy to be educated at <HI>Sevil,</HI> and for the re&s;t the Let|ter inform'd me.</P>
<P>I was mightily pleas'd with the Per&s;on of the black Gentleman, and treated him civilly, with the A&s;&s;urance of delivering him &s;afe to his Friends at <HI>Mexico.</HI></P>
<P>When we were alone, he told me he had a farther Secret to di&s;cover to me, if he was &s;ure of not being interrupted. Upon hearing this, I order'd my Servant on Shore for &s;ome Nece&s;&s;a|ries, and inform'd him, we need not fear any Interruption for &s;ome Hours.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="250">
After a long Pau&s;e, and ca&s;ting his Eyes on the Ground, he began.</P>
<P>This Veil of Night would not hide my Blu&s;h|es, if I were not convinc'd in your Knowledge of my Frailty. But if you'll con&s;ider my Youth, Climate, and Opportunity, you will allow few of my Sex could with&s;tand the Temptation. Be not &s;urpriz'd to find in this Di&s;gui&s;e the Daugh|ter of <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> who is &s;o far &s;ubject to the caprice of Love, as to di&s;clo&s;e to you the inmo&s;t Secret of her Heart.</P>
<P>The Letter you left with me produc'd a con|trary Effect than I believe you imagin'd; and in|&s;tead of Rage and Indignation taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Brea&s;t, a &s;ofter Pa&s;&s;ion &s;tole in, and I felt all the Tenderne&s;s imaginable for <HI>Don Pedro.</HI></P>
<P>I expect nothing but ill U&s;age from you for my pa&s;t Conduct; but if you can believe there is any Sincerity in Woman, after what I have been guilty of, I am a&s;&s;ur'd you may depend on what I &s;ay, that no other Object &s;hall &s;hare my Heart with you. I do not mean the tye of Wedlock, but if you will accept of me as I am, I'll be as &s;ub&s;ervient to your Commands, as your meane&s;t Slave.</P>
<P>I was &s;o confounded between Plea&s;ure and A|mazement, that I imagin'd all I heard and &s;aw was a Dream; but being &s;weetly convinc'd of the Reality, I &s;aid all my Pa&s;&s;ion could &s;ugge&s;t in return, not giving my &s;elf time to con&s;ider of the Oddne&s;s of the Accident: 'Twas &s;ufficient I had in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion all that was lovely in Woman, in my Imagination; and I had no other Thought, but how to keep her from the Knowledge of her Father on Shore, and the Sailors on Board, for we did not know when we &s;hould &s;et Sail.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="251">
My Mi&s;tre&s;s told me, if &s;he had not &s;ucceed|ed with me, &s;he re&s;olv'd for a Nunnery, but &s;ince we were reconciled, &s;he had laid by all Thoughts of the Habit. She made her E&s;cape from her Father's, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance, or Knowledge of any one but <HI>Tere&s;a.</HI> But what favour'd her E&s;cape was, the Ab&s;ence of her Fa|ther for ten Days in the Country; yet &s;he fear'd, when he came home again, he would fright <HI>Tere&s;a</HI> into Con&s;e&s;&s;ion, or by Promi&s;es get it out of her; for that &s;he was mercenary enough to &s;ell any thing &s;he had to the be&s;t Bidder. To pre|vent which, we agreed to dre&s;s her in the Ha|bit of a Man, and let her wear her own Com|plexion.</P>
<P>Accordingly we both went on Shore at <HI>Ca|diz,</HI> and &s;oon equipt our &s;elves with what we wanted, and on Board I brought my Spark, as a Relation of mine, that had a Mind to run his Fortune with me. The next Day the Wind proving favourable, we &s;et Sail, and left our Ap|prehen&s;ions behind us.</P>
<P>I was obliged to let our Servant into the Se|cret, that I might have it kept &s;o; well know|ing, if he had di&s;cover'd it him&s;elf, it had not been a Secret long, tho' the Fellow was very faithful to any Secret that was tru&s;ted to him.</P>
<P>We touch'd at the <HI>Madera</HI> I&s;lands, pa&s;s'd the Pike of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> got over the Line, duck'd our Men as u&s;ual, and met with no extraordi|nary Accident; but in fifty three Days, arriv'd &s;afe at the City of <HI>Sancta Domingo,</HI> (or St. <HI>Domi|nick)</HI> the capital City of the I&s;land <HI>Hi&s;paniola.</HI></P>
<P>I was very well pleas'd to find &s;o delightful a Place as this was, after the Fatigue of our Voyage. My Mi&s;tre&s;s and I took us a Lodging at a good|natur'd <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s, that treated us very well&mdash;for our Money.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="252">
Here my Lady told me, &s;he felt the Effects of our Familiarity. I endeavour'd to per&s;uade her I had no Hand in't; but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon't, that the Deed was done by me, and gave me &s;ome Proofs to believe it.</P>
<P>I was very much concern'd to find Means to hide it from the Hou&s;e; for &s;he began to have tho&s;e Qualms which attend that natural Di&s;tem|per; and by the Beauty of her Face, I fear'd her Sex might &s;oon be di&s;tingui&s;h'd.</P>
<P>I kept her from the Sight of our Ship's Crew in the Voyage, &s;he always &s;taying in the Cabin; and it was very dangerous to di&s;cover a fine Wo|man in this Part of the World, becau&s;e there are few that are hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>I was upon Thorns till our Departure for <HI>Mexico;</HI> but the Fleet &s;taying longer than I ex|pected, I took a Ramble to the mo&s;t noted Pla|ces in the I&s;land; and &s;ince I under&s;tand by your Story you never were there, I'll give you a &s;hort De&s;cription of it.</P>
<P><HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> is &s;eated from &s;eventeen Degrees, to nineteen Degrees Latitude, in Length about one hundred and twenty Leagues; and Breadth (about the middle Part) fifty. The Air much the &s;ame for Heat, as at <HI>Sevil</HI> in <HI>Spain;</HI> the Fruits delicious, and &s;ome peculiar to the Place.</P>
<P>The capital City, is St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> which gives a delightful Pro&s;pect from the Fields about it, being mix'd with plea&s;ant Gardens and Ri|vers.</P>
<P>Here the Governor of the I&s;land re&s;ides, and here are kept all their Offices, and Courts of Ju|dicature, and it is likewi&s;e the Store-hou&s;e to the whole I&s;land.</P>
<P>There are two Cities more, St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and <HI>Nue|&s;tra Sennora de alta Gracia;</HI> the la&s;t of which
<PB N="244" REF="253">
is to the South, and is famous for the be&s;t Cho|colate in the World.</P>
<P>The Cathedral of St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> is a hand&s;ome Pile of Building, and the other Churches are an&s;werable to the Grandeur of the Inhabitants, who&s;e very Artizans are wealthy.</P>
<P>The Fryers live as luxurious here, as in any o|ther Part of the World, and follow the Steps of their Brethren, in chu&s;ing the noble&s;t Situa|tions.</P>
<P>This I&s;land was di&s;cover'd by <HI>Columbus</HI> in the Year 1492, and kept in the Hands of the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> ever &s;ince that Time; while mo&s;t of their other Acqui&s;itions are fell to the <HI>Engli&s;h, French,</HI> and <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' the <HI>French</HI> have &s;ome Plantations in the I&s;land at pre&s;ent, yet they were of their own acquiring, and not taken from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and being chiefly Hunters, and not very rich, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> make no Attempt upon 'em.</P>
<P>No I&s;land can boa&s;t of more convenient Ports than this, and every Port di&s;embogues fine Rivers (&s;tor'd with palatable Fi&s;h) into the Sea; but then to qualify that Ble&s;&s;ing, they are very much infe&s;ted with Aligators, and Crocodiles. I &s;aw one lying on the Shore-&s;ide like a Log of Wood, and as a Buffalo came there to drink, he &s;prung upon him, dragg'd him to the Bottom, and there devour'd him; tho' they are ea&s;ily to be avoided, from the aromatic Smell that comes from their Skin.</P>
<P>I was much &s;urpriz'd to find in mo&s;t Hou&s;es, Serpents in&s;tead of Cats, that were greater Ene|mies to Rats and Mice; but what was more plea&s;ing, they were not the lea&s;t Offen&s;ive, having no Venom in 'em. But then, they will often play the Fox with the Poultry, and de|&s;troy many of them, unle&s;s narrowly watched.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="254">
The <HI>Scolopendria</HI> of the <HI>Greeks</HI> is found here, and very large Scorpions; but by the Divine Pro|vidence, neither of 'em hurtful.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not trouble you with any farther Ac|count of this I&s;land, becau&s;e there is not any thing to be found there, but what is upon the Continent, unle&s;s &s;ome particular Herbs; and as I am no Botani&s;t, I &s;hall not take any notice of 'em.</P>
<P>The time came at la&s;t for our embarking for <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> in order to go to <HI>Mexico,</HI> and I left St. <HI>Domingo</HI> with &s;ome Regret; as imagining I &s;hould not meet with any other Place in <HI>Ameri|ca</HI> &s;o plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>During our Voyage, my Mi&s;tre&s;s was mightily di&s;order'd.</P>
<P>We embark'd for <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> where we ar|riv'd without any Accident; and having no Bu&s;i|ne&s;s there, we &s;et out by Land for <HI>Mexico,</HI> and got &s;afe there. But enquiring for my Uncle, I was inform'd he was gone to re&s;ide at <HI>Lima,</HI> the capital City of <HI>Peru.</HI> My Concern was the more, in that I fear'd I &s;hould not meet with proper Ac|commodation at <HI>Mexico,</HI> for want of him, in the Affair of my Mi&s;tre&s;s; for her Condition would not bear the Fatigue of another Removal.</P>
<P>I was entertain'd in the Hou&s;e of a near Friend of my Uncle's, and one who kept a Corre&s;pon|dence with him; he was very civil to me, and of a freer Di&s;po&s;ition than generally the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are; but he had the &s;ame Vanity as all the old Chri&s;tians have, who Pride them&s;elves very much upon't. I let him into the Secret of my Lady, and her Condition; and by the help of his Wife, we made her rea&s;&s;ume her proper Dre&s;s. But we kept her private.</P>
<P>The time of her Delivery came, and the Product prov'd a lu&s;ty Boy, who &s;taid among us three
<PB N="246" REF="255">
Weeks, and then left us. I had no Scruples a|bout being the Father, for it was plain enough to be &s;een; it being my Picture in a little. My Mi&s;tre&s;s continu'd very weak longer than the u&s;ual Time; and I being alone with her one Day, &s;he told me &s;he was under &s;ome Apprehen|&s;ions concerning our Landlord, Don <HI>Manuel,</HI> who had made her &s;ecretly many large Offers, and the Nur&s;e was his Emi&s;&s;ary. I told her I had the &s;ame Propo&s;als from his Wife; and tho' the Wo|man was not di&s;agreeable, nay might pa&s;s for a Beauty, where Women were &s;o &s;carce, yet I could not find any Tenderne&s;s for her in my Heart.</P>
<P>After many Arguments between us, a Thought came into my Head, which I hop'd would produce &s;ome Mirth among us. I de&s;ir'd my Mi&s;tre&s;s to give Don <HI>Manuel</HI> &s;ome &s;mall Encou|ragement, and leave the re&s;t to me.</P>
<P>My Landlord &s;oon found an Opportunity, thro' my means, to &s;ee my Mi&s;tre&s;s. She fol|low'd my Advice, and tran&s;ported the <HI>Don</HI> out of his Sen&s;es; his Joy was not to be contain'd, he forgot the Gravity of a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and caper'd about like a <HI>French</HI> Dancing-ma&s;ter. When I learnt all their Di&s;cour&s;e from my Mi&s;tre&s;s, I begg'd her to continue her good Humour to him, and promi&s;e him a meeting that Day Seven-night in the Summer-hou&s;e of the Garden. She did as I directed.</P>
<P>In the mean time I took my Opportunity to confabulate with the Wife, and gave her Di|rections the Night appointed, to go to the &s;ame Summer-hou&s;e, but to avoid Speech, being it was over the Water, and Men were continually pa&s;&s;ing to and fro. The good Woman was as much overjoy'd as her Husband; and the better to carry on my De&s;ign, I gave it out, that I was
<PB N="247" REF="256">
to go with &s;ome Gentlemen a hunting the Buf|falo for two or three Days. I de&s;ir'd my Land|lord (a Title I had given him out of Mirth) to take care of my Wife in my Ab&s;ence. I told my good Landlady, this was a Contrivance of mine, that we might not be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>My Mi&s;tre&s;s had made ju&s;t the &s;ame Agree|ment with the <HI>Don.</HI> The Time came, and the good Man and good Woman were left to worry one another, with their extraordinary Pa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The next Day at Dinner, (for we generally eat together) Don <HI>Manuel</HI> ca&s;t many a Sheep's Eye at my Wife, and his good Lady at me.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day, as I was reading in the Gar|den, <HI>Madona</HI> came to me, and in bitter terms of Reproach gave me. much ill Language; and told me I had betray'd her to her Husband ba&s;e|ly, by giving him the Ring &s;he gave me the la&s;t Night. I &s;oon found that &s;he had made a Pre&s;ent to her Husband of a Ring, taking him for me, and &s;he had ob&s;erv'd it upon his Fin|ger. She made &s;o many Speeches about it, that at la&s;t I was compell'd to tell her the whole Truth, to get rid of her tire&s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion, but I &s;oon repented of my Declaration; for &s;he flew upon me, and with her Nails play'd the Cat with my Face, and I had much ado to di&s;engage my &s;elf from her. So furious does a di&s;appointed Pa&s;&s;ion make a Woman.</P>
<P>Her confounded Temper made me re&s;olve to leave <HI>Mexico.</HI> The Husband began to &s;u&s;pect &s;omething of the Affair; but his Imagination, that he had the Company of my Wi&s;e in the Summer-hou&s;e, curb'd his Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The Woman's Rage was un&s;urmountable, and it was not in my Power to bring her to Temper: Therefore I cho&s;e to avoid her as much as po&s;|&s;ible.
<PB N="248" REF="257">
As I was at Supper with my Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ome few Days after the Accident happen'd, &s;he told me, &s;he had receiv'd a Pre&s;ent of Cordial-water from Don <HI>Manuel</HI>'s Wife. Now I had not told her of <HI>Madona</HI>'s Re&s;entment, becau&s;e I imagin'd it might make her unea&s;y: But a&s;&s;oon as I heard of the Pre&s;ent, &s;omething &s;truck my Mind, there was &s;omething uncommon in it; I therefore de&s;ir'd my Mi&s;tre&s;s not to drink any of it. Lord &s;aid &s;he, my Dear, I have already, and de&s;ire you would ta&s;te it too, for 'tis the plea|&s;ante&s;t Liquor I ever drank in my Life.</P>
<P>I was mightily di&s;turb'd at it, and two Hours di&s;cover'd the fatal Effects.</P>
<P>My Mi&s;tre&s;s began to be very much out of or|der; and notwith&s;tanding all the Aid of Phy&s;i|cians, &s;he expir'd in my Arms, and every body agreed &s;he had been poi&s;on'd. I had, in my Fury and Ravings, declar'd to Don <HI>Manuel</HI> the Au|thor of this black Deed; and when he went to enquire after her, was inform'd &s;he went out be|fore Night, and was &s;uppos'd to have gone to the Town of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> on the Lake, to one of her Relations. Don <HI>Manuel</HI> &s;ent after her, but &s;he was not to be found. He grieved at the lo&s;s of my Mi&s;tre&s;s, as much as I did; and I dare a|vow, if he had found his Wife, he would have &s;acrific'd her to the <HI>Manes</HI> of my dear Mi|&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I was very much griev'd for the Lo&s;s of my Mi&s;tre&s;s, for I had rea&s;on to be convinc'd her Pa&s;&s;ion for me was unfeign'd. You may ea&s;ily imagine, there was no &s;taying for me in the Hou&s;e where this di&s;mal Accident happen'd; but as I was preparing to be gone, the <HI>Corrigidore</HI> &s;ent for me to appear before him, to give him the be&s;t Account I could of this Action. I re|lated to him the whole Truth, as I have told it
<PB N="249" REF="258">
you; only I declar'd it was my Wife I had lo&s;t. Don <HI>Manuel</HI> was &s;eiz'd, and put in Pri&s;on, not|with&s;tanding I in&s;i&s;ted upon his Innocency; but he proceeded in that manner, being it was &s;up|pos'd he was acce&s;&s;ary to his Wife's E&s;cape. But a few Days after he was &s;ecur'd, News was brought, that his Wife was found murder'd in the Woods, as it was &s;uppos'd by &s;ome <HI>Indians,</HI> as &s;he was endeavouring to make her E&s;cape from the Hands of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he met her Reward for her barbarous Murder of a Woman that never wrong'd her, tho' indeed the Favour was de&s;ign'd for me.</P>
<P>A few Days after this fatal Accident, I heard of &s;ome Merchants that de&s;ign'd to cro&s;s the Continent to the <HI>South Sea</HI> with a good Guard. I made Acquaintance with 'em, paid my Quota to the Charge, and &s;et out along with 'em, leaving behind me the hateful City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> where I had lo&s;t the only thing I e&s;teem'd on Earth. And I mu&s;t own to you, notwith&s;tand|ing my Philo&s;ophy, I never thought of her for &s;ome time without the utmo&s;t Heart-breaking. I have endeavour'd indeed, by forcing my Tem|per to Mirth, to bury the Remembrance; and Time, with good Company, has brought me &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance; yet neverthele&s;s, I do firmly believe, no Woman's Charms will ever for the future break my Re&s;t; for I am &s;atisfy'd, my late Mi&s;tre&s;s made a Hole quite through my Heart.</P>
<P>But to pur&s;ue my Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;et out, with a Guard of fifty <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Sol|diers, for fear of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who had made it their daily Practice to &s;et upon every body that went through the Country, if not too &s;trong for 'em. I need not tell you, that <HI>Mexico</HI> is one of the fine&s;t Cities in the World, or that it lies
<PB N="250" REF="259">
upon a Lake, and no other Pa&s;&s;age to it but over three broad Cau&s;ways from different Cities on the Land. But what is &s;omething extraordinary, one part of the Lake is bracki&s;h, and noi&s;ome, with no living Creature in't; and the other is fre&s;h, whol&s;ome, and &s;tor'd with palatable Fi&s;h. But as there are many exact Accounts of the Con|tinent of <HI>America,</HI> and its Conque&s;t, by my no|ble Countryman <HI>Hernando Cortes,</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay no more of it; but I will take the Liberty to add that <HI>Cae&s;ar&punc;</HI> and <HI>Alexander</HI> were but Pigmy Con|querors to him; and every body will be of that Opinion, if they will give them&s;elves the Trou|ble of reading his Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>We met with no <HI>Indians</HI> to oppo&s;e our Pa&s;|&s;age, and arriv'd at <HI>Segovia,</HI> an inland Town in|viron'd with Rocks, and but meanly built. Some of our Company &s;taid there, and I was willing to &s;tay along with 'em to refre&s;h my &s;elf; for it's but indifferent travelling over rocky Moun|tains, and cro&s;&s;ing Rivers upon Hurdles, that is Pieces of Timber la&s;h'd together with Ropes; and it is &s;ometimes dangerous, tho' we got over &s;afe with our whole Company.</P>
<P>I &s;taid fifteen Days at <HI>Segovia,</HI> with fifteen of my Companions. I was very much &s;urpriz'd at the Relation of &s;ome of the Inhabitants of that Place, who told me, about two hundred of your Countrymen the Year before (Free-booters) in &s;pight of all Oppo&s;ition came from the <HI>South Sea,</HI> to the <HI>North,</HI> with a very great Booty, de|feated the <HI>Spaniards</HI> when ten to one, and po&s;ted to all the Advantage in the World, &s;everal times. The People of <HI>Segovia</HI> talk of 'em as &s;o many Devils; and that they were aided by the black Gentleman, or it had been an Impo&s;&s;ibi|lity to have gone through what they did. But

it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, your Countrymen de&s;pi&s;e Hazards, and laugh at the greate&s;t Dangers.</P>
<P>After we had &s;ufficiently refre&s;h'd our &s;elves, we took our Leaves of <HI>Segovia,</HI> and pur&s;u'd our Journey to the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> with a Guard of <HI>In|dians,</HI> &s;ub&s;ervient to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> And I mu&s;t own to you, there is not a People in the World more true to their Tru&s;t, than tho&s;e confederate <HI>Indians</HI> that own the Dominion of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Our Journey to St. <HI>Fee</HI> was plea&s;ant enough, through a rich, level, plea&s;ant Country, and we rode upon Mules, a Bea&s;t of a &s;ure Foot; and our chief Diver&s;ion was &s;hooting of Monkies, that play'd us &s;everal comical Tricks, running up the Trees, and frequently did us the Favour to urine in our Faces, and &s;ometimes &s;omething wor&s;e.</P>
<P>When we arriv'd at St. <HI>Fee,</HI> a &s;mall Town and Port in the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> we had the good Fortune of meeting with a Ve&s;&s;el ready to &s;et Sail for <HI>Lima.</HI> We went immediately on Board, and got clear of the Shore that Evening.</P>
<P>We arriv'd at <HI>Lima</HI> after a Voyage of twenty five Days; we landed at <HI>Calao,</HI> the Port that all the Ships of <HI>Spain</HI> anchor at, and one of the fine&s;t in the <HI>South-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The Town is built upon a Point of Land that runs into the Sea. It is very &s;trongly fortify'd, and well garri&s;on'd. I &s;ent my Servant to my Uncle at <HI>Lima,</HI> to acquaint him that I was coming to wait on him the next Day; but my Servant return'd in four Hours, with my Uncle's Coach, who inform'd me, that he was impatient till he &s;aw me. My Uncle was Judge of the Civil Courts, and a Man in very great Power. He &s;ent his <HI>Major Domo</HI> to wait on me, with his Excu&s;e, that he had come him&s;elf, but that he was afflicted with the Gout. I only &s;taid
<PB N="252" REF="261">
till I had put on other Cloaths, and immedi|ately after went in the Coach with the <HI>Major Domo,</HI> and arriv'd at my Uncle's ju&s;t within Night. He was very well pleas'd to &s;ee me, and care&s;s'd me in an extraordinary manner. But I was &s;omething &s;urpriz'd to find that he had re&s;olv'd for <HI>Spain</HI> within a Month, there to end his Days.</P>
<P>I told him the Story of my Father's unhap|py Fate, only concealing his Love to <HI>Donna Elvira.</HI> He was very much &s;hock'd at the News, owning to me his chief Rea&s;on of going to <HI>Spain,</HI> was to have the Happine&s;s of living to|gether. I then told him, I &s;uppos'd as that could not be, that he would alter his Re&s;olu|tion, and think no more of his Voyage: But he an&s;wer'd, mo&s;t of his Effects were gone for <HI>Spain</HI> two Months before, and that he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity follow.</P>
<P>I gave him to under&s;tand, that it was not in my Power to wait upon him. He took a great deal of Pains to per&s;uade me to it, but when he found it was to no purpo&s;e, he told me &s;ince I was not to be prevail'd upon, he would leave me Ma&s;ter of a &s;mall Fortune in <HI>Lima.</HI></P>
<P>During his Stay, he introduc'd me to mo&s;t of the be&s;t Families in the City, and the Vice|roy was pleas'd to &s;how me good Countenance, and promis'd my Uncle to provide for me.</P>
<P>When the time came of his embarking for <HI>Spain,</HI> I waited on him on Board, where we took Leave, though not with dry Eyes; and I have repented many times that I did not accompany him. But we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to Fate; and what is allotted us by Fortune will come.</P>
<P>He left me Ma&s;ter of a well-furni&s;h'd Hou&s;e, and a Plantation who&s;e Income would provide
<PB N="253" REF="262">
every thing Nece&s;&s;ity requir'd in the middle Station of Life, with a Promi&s;e that at his Death I &s;hould inherit the Remainder of his E&s;tate; for he was a &s;ingle Man, and had no nearer Relation than my &s;elf.</P>
<P>I took all the Plea&s;ure the Place would af|ford; and to &s;ay Truth there was no want of any thing at <HI>Lima,</HI> except the Conver&s;ation of the Female Sex; though I mu&s;t freely confe&s;s I did not always want that.</P>
<P>The Viceroy prov'd very kind to me, but Death taking him away &s;uddenly, I mightily griev'd his Lo&s;s, as indeed I had Rea&s;on; for the Per&s;on that &s;ucceeded him prov'd the Re|ver&s;e. He made a general Remove of all the Officers the Deceas'd had put in Po&s;ts, and a|mong the re&s;t I was one of the Sufferers; and farther, upon all Occa&s;ions he made it his Bu|&s;ine&s;s to &s;light me; and often affronted me &s;o gro&s;ly, that nothing but his Dignity &s;hrouded him from my Re&s;entment: and many other Peo|ple in Power, (as the Injudicious generally co|py the Frailties of their Superiors, and neglect their Virtues) treated me in the &s;ame Manner; but I was re&s;olv'd not to bear it.</P>
<P>One Day as I was coming from my Plantation upon my Mule, attended only with my old Ser|vant, I met a Nephew of the Viceroy's in his Chai&s;e, in a narrow Road, and not being wil|ling to give way to him, we were both at a Stand; which &s;o enrag'd the cholerick Gentle|man, that he flew out of his Vehicle, and ran his Spado into the Belly of my Mule, which dropt down dead.</P>
<P>I did not want &s;o much Provocation to rai&s;e my Choler, therefore I drew upon him, and left him in the &s;ame Condition with my Bea&s;t, grov'ling upon the Sand. He had &s;everal Peo|ple
<PB N="254" REF="263">
that attended him, who ru&s;h'd upon me and my Man, overpower'd us, and dragg'd us immediately to the Viceroy's Palace; who, be|ing glad of any Pretence to wreak his Ill-nature upon me, condemn'd me to <HI>Baldivia</HI> for Life, in &s;pite of the Interce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e few Friends I had.</P>
<P>It was in vain to complain of this damn'd Trick of Fortune; and the more to plague me, he left Orders that I &s;hould be di&s;pos'd of to <HI>Don Sancho Ramires,</HI> a Relation of his; the Wretch that I have &s;ufficiently reveng'd my &s;elf of, and, in part, of the inhumane Viceroy; for they were Partners in Trade.</P>
<P><HI>Ramires</HI> us'd to put me upon the mo&s;t &s;la|vi&s;h Bu&s;ine&s;s, but as I had Money I u&s;ually bought it off; for I receiv'd yearly my &s;mall E&s;tate from <HI>Lima,</HI> I mean from my Plantation, for the Viceroy had &s;eiz'd all the re&s;t of my Moveables; and would have done this, but that the hone&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> who had the occupying of it, in&s;i&s;ted on its being my Uncle's.</P>
<P>This old Hunks had a beautiful Daughter, that I found was in Love with a Colonel of the Garri&s;on of <HI>Baldivia.</HI> This Colonel, not|with&s;tanding my Condition, was not a&s;ham'd of my Acquaintance, and often told me the Tor|ments he endur'd for the young Lady.</P>
<P>I ask'd him if the Lady knew of his Pa&s;&s;ion; he inform'd me that he flatter'd him&s;elf with the Return, though they had never &s;poke to each other, but he had receiv'd obliging Glan|ces from her fair Eyes, from the Gallery which overlook'd the Court of Guard.</P>
<P>I agreed that if he would write a Letter, I'd pawn my Life &s;he &s;hould have it, and an An|&s;wer into the Bargain; if &s;he had any Inclina|tion to &s;end one. He embrac'd me, and thank'd
<PB N="255" REF="264">
me for my kind Proffer, and wrote a pa&s;&s;ionate Letter to the Lady; which I accompanied with another, to let her know I was devoted to her Service upon the Colonel's Account.</P>
<P>In two Days I had an An&s;wer convey'd in|to a hollow Tree in the Garden, as I had con|certed in my Note to her, that waited upon the Colonel's.</P>
<P>The&s;e Paper Me&s;&s;engers brought Matters to bear, and the kind Lady re&s;olv'd to venture her &s;elf with the Colonel.</P>
<P>We contriv'd a Ladder of Ropes long enough to reach from her Window to the Terras on the Court of Guard; and I convey'd a &s;mall Bundle of Packthread for her to throw down, which we fa&s;ten'd to the Ladder of Ropes, and the Lady with much Difficulty pull'd it up, and fa&s;ten'd to an Iron Che&s;t which was in the Room: But as &s;he came trembling for Fear down the Ladder, it drew the Che&s;t along the Floor above, which awaken'd that old Devil her Father. He immediately alarm'd all the Ser|vants, as well as Slaves; but the Captain had got &s;afe off with his Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>When old Huncks had &s;ummon'd us all to|gether, he went into the Room to &s;ee what the Matter was; but when he found his Mo|ney &s;afe, his Di&s;traction began to abate. I mu&s;t own, I wi&s;h'd heartily we could have clear'd his Money too, as well as his Daughter. It was &s;ome time ere he mi&s;s'd her, as having no No|tion of her Elopement; but when he found &s;he was gone, his Pa&s;&s;ion was un&s;urmountable; for the good Lady had made bold with Writings of an E&s;tate, that it &s;eems were left her by an old Aunt; and I was very well pleas'd &s;he did not go empty-handed to my Colonel; for I take Money to be the Sinews of Love as well as War.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="265">
The inrag'd <HI>Don</HI> ran up and down like a Madman, with about a dozen of us at his Heels; and as we approach'd the Ditch of the Ca&s;tle, which happen'd to be free from Water, being the Tide was out, but pretty well provided with Mud, &s;ome of his Servants imagin'd they &s;aw &s;omething lie on the Mud. The old <HI>Don</HI> being very peery, was &s;tooping down and ga|zing to be &s;atisfy'd; and the Devil prompting me ju&s;t at the &s;ame time, I clapt my Knee in|to his Bum, and down fell the poor <HI>Don</HI> into the Mud.</P>
<P>I was the fir&s;t that cry'd out for Help, yet I did not make extraordinary Ha&s;te to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; but at la&s;t Ropes were brought, and after he had flounder'd about a Quarter of an Hour, we lugg'd him up in a &s;weet Pickle.</P>
<P>By good Luck, he did not mi&s;tru&s;t that the Favour was de&s;ign'd him, but purely acciden|tal. I had an Opportunity the next Day to find out the Lady and the happy Colonel, who had brought a Commi&s;&s;ion from the Prie&s;t to go to Bed together. He was &s;o well pleas'd with my Service, that he promis'd to ran&s;om me from <HI>Don Sancho,</HI> and did not doubt but he &s;hould &s;ucceed, being the <HI>Don</HI> made Money his <HI>Summum Bonum.</HI> But we were &s;urpriz'd at the Refu&s;al, for he had &s;uch a &s;trict Charge from the Viceroy of <HI>Peru</HI> to hold me fa&s;t, that it was more his Intere&s;t to keep me than part with me. Nay this Propo&s;al open'd the old <HI>Don</HI>'s Eyes, for he &s;aw plainly I was at Bottom of his Daughter's Affair. This &s;o enrag'd him that he order'd a great wooden Clog to be lock'd fa&s;t to my Leg, which I was oblig'd to lug along with me.</P>
<P>This Proceeding drove me almo&s;t to De&s;pair, and I lo&s;t all Hopes of ever procuring my Liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="266">
The Colonel and his Lady (who had reco|ver'd the Fortune from <HI>Don Sancho)</HI> were very much griev'd at my ill U&s;age, and try'd all man|ner of Means for my Liberty, but to no purpo&s;e. I pa&s;t three Years in this uncomfortable Life, and had the Plea&s;ure to hear that my implaca|ble Enemy, the Viceroy of <HI>Peru,</HI> was &s;ummon'd to <HI>Spain,</HI> upon the Account of &s;ome Male-Ad|mini&s;tration. At the hearing of this News my Hope of Freedom began to revive, but it was &s;oon clouded again; for the old Devil, <HI>Don San|cho,</HI> was re&s;olv'd to keep me a Martyr to his own Revenge; and I weather'd out two Years more in my wretched Confinement: Though, Thanks to Heaven, nothing depre&s;s'd my Spirits quite.</P>
<P>The Colonel got an Opportunity to tell me that there was a Ve&s;&s;el in the Road bound for <HI>Lima:</HI> and the Captain being a very good Friend of his, he had prevailed with him to take me on Board him, if it was po&s;&s;ible for me to get out of Hunks's Clutches.</P>
<P>I made all the Efforts imaginable, but to no purpo&s;e; and I was once more in my Imagina|tion given up to eternal Slavery.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Night, as I was endeavouring to compo&s;e my troubled Thoughts, I heard a great Noi&s;e in the Ca&s;tle-Yard, and was very much &s;urpriz'd a while after, when I &s;aw an Officer and a File of Soldiers come to &s;eize me, as a Plotter again&s;t the State, and carry'd me to the Colonel's Lodging. But my Surprize was turn'd into Joy, when I found he had us'd this Stratagem to gain me my Freedom. I told him he had trebly repaid the Obligation he was pleas'd to &s;ay he lay under to me, and I was re&s;olv'd not to accept of my Liberty till I found what Stir <HI>Don Sancho</HI> made about it: but the
<PB N="258" REF="267">
Colonel re&s;olv'd me that he had the Means in his own Hands to pacify him.</P>
<P>I went on Board, and &s;et Sail the &s;ame Even|ing. We had but an indifferent Voyage, being involv'd in many Storms; yet at la&s;t we arriv'd &s;afe at <HI>Calao.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall, if you think fit, give you a &s;hort De|&s;cription of <HI>Baldivia,</HI> becau&s;e few Foreigners are permitted to enter their Port.</P>
<P><HI>Baldivia,</HI> or <HI>Valdivia,</HI> takes its Name from the fir&s;t Founder, a <HI>Spaniard.</HI> The old Town &s;tood a little higher than the new one, till it was de&s;troy'd by the <HI>Indians.</HI> For <HI>Peter Baldi|via,</HI> and the re&s;t of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> were &s;uch Tyrants over the poor Natives, that they took Heart, laid an Ambu&s;h for 'em, and de&s;troy'd 'em every one. But in the new Town they are &s;ufficiently guarded from their In&s;ults, or Danger of a foreign Enemy; which have often attempted 'em to no Purpo&s;e. This being reck|on'd the riche&s;t Country for Gold Mines in all <HI>America,</HI> Nature has befriended 'em very much in the Strength of the Place; for there is &s;o large a Sand-Bank in the Mouth of the Bay, that Ve&s;&s;els are obliged to come within five hundred Yards of the Shore (which is guarded by a &s;trong Ca&s;tle) to avoid it. It is a difficult Harbour to enter, but when you are once at Anchor, no Wind on the whole Compa&s;s can hurt you, tho' it blew a Storm; it is &s;o well &s;helter'd by the Land on all Sides of it.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are chiefly made up of ba|ni&s;h'd Per&s;ons, who generally work in the Mines for &s;o many Years; and the Time expir'd, they have &s;o much Land of their own to cultivate; and mo&s;t of them find the Means to be rich; but how hone&s;tly I'll give you leave to judge. The Country about it is very fruitful, and
<PB N="259" REF="268">
produces great Quantities of Apple Trees, from which they make very good Cyder. But the Juice of the Grape is very uncomatible there, and tho&s;e that do procure it mu&s;t pay extrava|gantly for it.</P>
<P>This City, for it's no le&s;s, is e&s;teem'd the Key to the <HI>South-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The Governour and Officers are generally &s;ent from <HI>Lima,</HI> but the Soldiers are compos'd of tho&s;e Per&s;ons that are &s;ent there for a Puni&s;h|ment. And tho' few Per&s;ons chu&s;e to be &s;ent there, yet as few de&s;ire to leave it when once they are &s;ettled.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the People could make &s;hift to live without Religion, yet there are &s;even Churches and three Mona&s;teries; but they &s;eem to be in a ruinated Condition: And I don't doubt but an Age or two hence, tho&s;e that pa&s;s that Way may find them totally ruined.</P>
<P>As I &s;aid, we arriv'd &s;afe at the Port of <HI>Calao.</HI> I was re&s;olv'd to remain <HI>incognito,</HI> till I had en|quir'd into the Affairs of the City.</P>
<P>I took an Occa&s;ion to &s;end to my <HI>Indian</HI> Te|nant, who came to me, and was very well pleas'd to find me at Liberty.</P>
<P>I &s;ent him to &s;everal of my Friends, to ac|quaint them what Circum&s;tance I lay under, who &s;oon inform'd the Viceroy of my Misfor|tune, and he as readily comply'd with my De|&s;ire, allowing me the Liberty I had enjoy'd be|fore I was &s;ent to <HI>Baldivia.</HI></P>
<P>I once more made my Appearance at <HI>Lima,</HI> renew'd my Acquaintance, and began to divert my &s;elf as before. By degrees I crept into the good Graces of the Viceroy, who gave me a Po&s;t in the Government, that brought me a con|&s;iderable Income; and with the E&s;teem of mo&s;t People I pa&s;t on a whole Year.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="269">
The Viceroy not liking his Situation, found the Means to be recall'd to <HI>Spain:</HI> Yet recom|mending me to his Succe&s;&s;or, I remain'd in the &s;ame Station he before had given me; though I cannot brag of any more Favours be&s;tow'd on me by my new Superior; for he was a Man of an uncertain Temper, proud, and revengeful. He was newly marry'd to a very rich Widow of <HI>Lima,</HI> who had a very beautiful Daughter, by Report; for &s;he was not &s;uffer'd to take the Liberties of the Place.</P>
<P>I often had a great De&s;ire to &s;ee her Face, for I had ob&s;erv'd her veil'd many times at Church, which was all the Liberty &s;he had. I was in form'd &s;he was de&s;ign'd a Wife for the <HI>Supreme Judge,</HI> though much again&s;t her Inclination, be|ing there was a Di&s;parity of Years, which is cer|tainly the greate&s;t Bitter to the Sweets of Ma|trimony; but nothing is con&s;ulted now more than Wealth.</P>
<P>I receiv'd a Letter from my Uncle at <HI>Sevil,</HI> wherein he de&s;ir'd I would leave <HI>Lima,</HI> and come to <HI>Spain:</HI> And, to induce me to it, he gave me the Promi&s;e to make me his Heir. I mu&s;t own I began to be pretty well tir'd of this Climate; and the Time drawing on for the Expiration of my Mortgage, I &s;et my &s;elf to prepare things accordingly.</P>
<P>I di&s;pos'd of my Plantation to my faithful <HI>Indian,</HI> for an under Price, being I thought I was under many Obligations to him. I re&s;ign'd up my Office in the Viceroy's Palace, indeed, becau&s;e I could not get Leave to di&s;po&s;e of it.</P>
<P>I turn'd all my Effects into Gold-Du&s;t, and &s;ent it before me to my Uncle; and now I on|ly waited for Company to go over Land to <HI>Vera Cruz,</HI> a Port in the North Sea, where I &s;hould have Convenience of imbarking for <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="270">
I began now to think of &s;ettling in the World; and indeed it was almo&s;t time, for I had pa&s;t my twenty-eighth Year, and at that Age the Heat of Youth &s;hould be pretty well over; for if a Man cannot &s;ee his Follies on this &s;ide thir|ty, he is in Danger of being incorrigible all the Days of his Life. Be&s;ide, I had very good Encouragement to Stability, my own Fortune, and the Pro&s;pect of my Uncle's; who in all Probability had not many Years to live, being in his eighty-third Year.</P>
<P>Well then, as my Story is almo&s;t off the Stage, I'll throw you into the Bargain a &s;hort Account of one Place more, for my Cata&s;trophe, and then to my Epilogue for detaining you &s;o long, and that &s;hall be the De&s;cription of <HI>Lima,</HI> as it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Lima,</HI> the Capital City of <HI>Peru,</HI> is &s;eated a|bout two Leagues from the Sea-Port of <HI>Callao,</HI> in 12 Degrees 6 Minutes of Southern Latitude, and 79 Degrees 45 Minutes of We&s;tern Lon|gitude. It is built in a noble Plain, with Hills at a Di&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Francis Pizarro</HI> was the Founder, in the Year 1535, tho' it has chang'd its Name &s;ince his Time, from <HI>La Ciudad de los Reges,</HI> or <HI>City of Kings,</HI> to <HI>Lima,</HI> which is only a Corruption of the <HI>Indian</HI> Word <HI>Rimac,</HI> which was the Name of an <HI>Indian</HI> Idol, formerly wor&s;hip'd in that Place.</P>
<P>This is the fine&s;t City (next to <HI>Mexico)</HI> in all <HI>America.</HI> All the Streets are in a direct Line, exactly mea&s;ur'd out, and much of the &s;ame Length and Breadth, being fifty Yards wide.</P>
<P>In the Heart of the City is the noble&s;t Square my Eyes ever beheld, and in the mid&s;t a Foun|tain of Bra&s;s, adorn'd with eight Lions, con|tinually &s;pouting Water, &s;upply'd by the River
<PB N="262" REF="271">
of <HI>Lima,</HI> that runs through the Skirts of the Town, cover'd with a hand&s;ome Stone Bridge that leads to the Suburbs. Within the Suburbs is a fine publick Walk, beautify'd with Orange Trees, and in the Evening is crowded with the be&s;t Company of the City. Although this Ci|ty is &s;o beautiful, it was mo&s;tly de&s;troy'd by an Earthquake in the Year 1682. There are no le&s;s than fifty-&s;even Churches and Chappels (with tho&s;e that are in the Mona&s;teries) in this City, and twenty-four Mona&s;teries for Men, and twelve for Women. The Cathedral is very magnificent, as are mo&s;t of the other Churches, tho' chiefly built with Wood from the fir&s;t Story, by rea|&s;on of the Earthquakes.</P>
<P>The Viceroy of <HI>Peru</HI> has his Re&s;idence here, and is &s;o powerful he hardly owns the King his Ma|&s;ter to be his Superior. Here are likewi&s;e kept all the Courts of Ju&s;tice, and from the High Court there is no Appeal. Among the re&s;t, they have &s;ettled an <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> which, on my Con&s;cience, is wor&s;e than that of <HI>Spain.</HI> Heaven keep e|very Body from it; for in this Court the In|formant is a Witne&s;s, and the Accu&s;er is ever behind the Curtain, and to mend the Matter, the Witne&s;&s;es are never brought Face to Face.</P>
<P>To compleat the Grandeur of the Place, there is an Archbi&s;hoprick, and an Univer&s;ity of three well-fill'd Colleges; tho' the Students don't al|ways follow Learning, for I have found &s;ome ignorant enough.</P>
<P>There are twelve Ho&s;pitals, and one of them for <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>This City is garri&s;on'd with two thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and &s;ix thou&s;and Foot; but very indiffer|ent Troops for Service again&s;t a foreign Foe, being chiefly compos'd of <HI>Creolians</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Creolians</HI> (who are &s;o nam'd from owing
<PB N="263" REF="272">
their Birth to <HI>America)</HI> are mo&s;t of 'em proud, lazy, and ignorant, and generally Tyrants when|ever they have Power, tho' &s;harp enough as to Trade, and will over-reach you if they can.</P>
<P>They are all inclin'd to Venery, and will &s;a|crifice every thing to gratify that Vice. The Women (who are really very hand&s;ome) gene|rally &s;it at home all Day cro&s;s-leg'd, and as mute as Fi&s;hes; but at Night it is cu&s;tomary for 'em to haunt the Streets veil'd, and will as hardly be refus'd a Favour, as the Men with us on the like Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>As I was &s;itting one Evening in my Lodging, di&s;patching &s;ome Letters for <HI>Spain,</HI> I heard &s;ome body knock &s;oftly at my Door. My Servant was gone abroad, and therefore I aro&s;e and open'd it my &s;elf, but was &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee a Lady veil'd, who, without making any Words, came in and &s;at down on a Couch. After &s;he had repos'd her &s;elf &s;ome time, &s;he unveil'd, and di&s;cover'd to me one of the &s;weete&s;t Faces I had ever &s;een. I was almo&s;t turn'd into Stone at the Sight of &s;o much Beauty, and was ready to fall down to wor&s;hip her as a Divinity. Said &s;he, I come not here to be gaz'd at; I like you, and if you can do the &s;ame by me, I believe you will not u&s;e me ill.</P>
<P>Madam, I return'd, I know no other way to convince you that I like you, but one. With that I took her into an Alcove, where we &s;oon came to a right Under&s;tanding. A&s;&s;oon as our &s;mall Matter of Bu&s;ine&s;s was over, &s;he de&s;ir'd to be di&s;mi&s;s'd, yet with a Promi&s;e to give me a|nother Vi&s;it the next Evening; but, &s;aid &s;he, if you &s;hould chance by any Accident to &s;ee me in any other Place, take your Eyes from the Object, for fear of Danger; for tho&s;e Me&s;|&s;engers of the Soul often betray their Tru&s;t.
<PB N="264" REF="273">
I promis'd to ob&s;erve her Directions, and left her, but yet could not help my Curio&s;ity; for when &s;he was got down Stairs, I put on my Cloak, follow'd her, and ob&s;erv'd &s;he want in|to the Viceroy's Palace. I was convinc'd, by the Dre&s;s &s;he wore, that &s;he was none of the common Sort; and much diverted I was at the Accident.</P>
<P>The next Day &s;he did me the Favour of a|nother Vi&s;it, when we pa&s;s'd our time as plea|&s;antly as we could; and my <HI>Incognita</HI> &s;eem'd ve|ry much pleas'd with my Company.</P>
<P>After our Toying was over, &s;he told me &s;he was afraid of lo&s;ing me, for &s;he had heard I de&s;ign'd for <HI>Spain.</HI> I inform'd her, nothing had Power to &s;top me, but the Pa&s;&s;ion I had for her.</P>
<P>She at la&s;t di&s;cover'd her&s;elf to me: She was Daughter-in-Law to the Viceroy: She told me that &s;he had re&s;pected me a great while, and had many Di&s;putes with her Honour and Love; but the former was forc'd to give way to the latter. She likewi&s;e let me know of her ap|proaching Marriage, and added that the Know|ledge of my Per&s;on would make her Aver&s;ion to her Husband the &s;tronger. We had many Meetings, to the Content of us both; and &s;he made me &s;everal Pre&s;ents of Jewels, which I intend to keep for her &s;ake, having pre&s;erv'd them thro' all my Fortunes. Our Meetings now began to be le&s;s frequent, being the Wedding-Day was fix'd, which gave me a great deal of Unea&s;i|ne&s;s. To divert my Melancholy, I u&s;ually took a Walk in the Orange-Grove, where, in my mu&s;ing Fits, I often &s;tay'd longer than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>As I was going home one Evening, I heard the Cla&s;hing of Swords at a Di&s;tance, and im|mediately after &s;aw a Per&s;on running towards
<PB N="265" REF="274">
me, who cry'd, For the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>'s &s;ake, if you are a Gentleman, lend me your Sword, to defend my &s;elf again&s;t a Villain who has offer'd me the vile&s;t indignity. I made him no An|&s;wer, but gave him my Sword (for he look'd like a Man of Quality) and follow'd him.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I turn'd the Corner I &s;aw him en|gag'd, and his Antagoni&s;t drop down dead.</P>
<P>The Gentleman &s;eeing that, took to his Heels.</P>
<P>The Street being alarm'd with the Bu&s;tle, as I came near the Body, I was &s;eiz'd as the Mur|derer. What &s;trengthen'd their Opinion, and I mu&s;t confe&s;s had but an indifferent Look, was my Sword remaining in the Body of the De|ceas'd. All my A&s;&s;everations of Innocence &s;igni|fy'd nothing: I was carried before the <HI>Corrigi|dore;</HI> but having no Witne&s;&s;es of my a&s;&s;aulting him, and one Fellow by good Fortune proving I was not the Per&s;on that engag'd him fir&s;t, I was only once more condemn'd to <HI>Baldivia.</HI> I curs'd my hard Stars a thou&s;and times, and the Grief of parting from my Mi&s;tre&s;s was like to rid me of Life; but Time began to wear it off.</P>
<P>I was &s;ecured in the Ca&s;tle of the City till the Ve&s;&s;el was ready to &s;ail.</P>
<P>While I was confin'd, in order to be tran&s;|ported to <HI>Baldivia,</HI> a Gentleman came into the Pri&s;on, and begg'd half an Hour's Conver&s;a|tion with me. I had been &s;o liberal to the Keep|er with my Money, and pretty jovial in my Hu|mour, that I believe if I had ask'd him to let me go, he would not have deney'd me; &s;o that I begg'd the Favour to admit the Gentleman, and his Ab&s;ence, during our Confabulation. He obey'd me in both, and the Gentleman enter'd my Room; which, though but mean, was the be&s;t in the Pri&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="275">
A&s;&s;oon as the Gentleman had repos'd him&s;elf upon a Chair, (none of the be&s;t) he ask'd me if I would plea&s;e to refre&s;h my &s;elf with a|ny thing the Place afforded: But I an&s;wering in the negative, he made half a dozen Humms and Haws, and open'd his Mouth to utter Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid he, you &s;ee before you the unhappy Per&s;on that is the occa&s;ion of your Confinement. I &s;hould not be thus free with you, if I were not a&s;&s;ur'd of your generous Good-nature. Once more I mu&s;t tell you, you &s;ee before you the unhappy Man who is guilty of that Fact you are to &s;uffer for. I am a Gentleman by Birth; and tho' I had not the good Fortune to owe my fir&s;t Being to old <HI>Spain,</HI> yet I have this for my Con&s;olation, that my Parents were born at <HI>Cordova</HI> there; but the Frowns of For|tune driving them to this part of the World, grew a&s;ham'd of her ill Looks, and greeted 'em with Smiles of Favour. In a few Years, <HI>Plutus</HI> the God of Wealth made 'em a Vi&s;it, and took his Leave of 'em with a Promi&s;e of his frequent Return; and he prov'd as good as his Word, for in a little time Fortune became a neuter Gender, that is, believing they did not want her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, they were no more her Devotees.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, the &s;ooner you will plea&s;e to come to plain <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> the &s;ooner I &s;hall be in the ready Road to your Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Why then, &s;aid he, not to keep you in Su&s;|pence, I am the Per&s;on that was oblig'd to you for your Sword on &s;uch a Time, which prov'd the In&s;trument of my Revenge on a ba&s;e Wretch, that de&s;erv'd an Eternity of Torments after this Life, for wronging the be&s;t of Women. And &s;ince I find you love the &s;horte&s;t way, without the tedious outward Flouri&s;hes of Rhetorick, I
<PB N="267" REF="276">
will inform you of my Story, with as much Brevity as I am capable of.</P>
<P>My Mother dy'd about &s;even Years &s;ince, and I may very ju&s;tly &s;ay the re&s;t of my Father's Life was a Delirium; but Death taking Pity of his Griefs, came to his Aid, and about two Years ago I was left Ma&s;ter of a plentiful For|tune.</P>
<P>As Death is the End of all things, and Age mu&s;t pay its Tribute to him, I &s;hook off my Grief for my Father's Lo&s;s; and in &s;ix Months after his decea&s;e, fell in Love with a young La|dy of an incomparable Beauty, at lea&s;t in my Eye. My Fortune gave me ea&s;y Acce&s;s to the Fa|ther of my Fair, and when I had the Happi|ne&s;s of conver&s;ing with the Object of my Wi&s;h|es, &s;he did not &s;eem aver&s;e to my Pa&s;&s;ion. E|very thing concurring to my De&s;ires, <HI>Hymen</HI> join'd tho&s;e Hands who&s;e Hearts were united before.</P>
<P>For &s;everal Days we revell'd in the Sweets of Love; and I may ju&s;tly &s;ay, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion had not the Power to pall De&s;ire; each Moment of Enjoyment &s;eem'd new, and my utmo&s;t Wi&s;h was center'd in her Brea&s;t: But the dire Fiend, tormenting Jealou&s;y, at la&s;t crept in, and pall'd my Appetite to ardent Love; the fatal Bitter to our mutual Sweets.</P>
<P>I had a Per&s;on that I call'd my Friend, who &s;har'd the Affluence of Fortune with me: We had the &s;ame De&s;ire to Love and Hate: I there|fore thought I was but poorly ble&s;t till my Friend &s;aw the Idol of my Soul. But oh! what Pangs that fatal Moment co&s;t me! His Eyes re|ceiv'd the Bane to all his Peace, and in one Mo|ment render'd up his Heart. I gave him Leave (for what could I refu&s;e to &s;uch a Friend?) to vi&s;it my Wife, when Bu&s;ine&s;s demanded my
<PB N="268" REF="277">
Ab&s;ence. He often declared his Pa&s;&s;ion to her, by plaintive Sighs and langui&s;hing Looks. When my Wife perceiv'd he importun'd her too far with his Love, &s;he threaten'd to tell me of it; but in the mean time he had acquainted me with what had pa&s;s'd between him and my Wife. Said he, My Friend, I imagin'd your Wife was like other Women, prone to change, therefore in your Ab&s;ence I counterfeited a Pa&s;&s;ion for her, to &s;ee whether &s;he had that Regard &s;he ought to have for you, and I am pleas'd to find you have made &s;o worthy a Choice.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own to you I was mightily pleas'd with this Tryal of my Friend, as believing it &s;prang from his Kindne&s;s to me; and I had much to do to reconcile my Wife to his Vi&s;its&punc; She would often &s;ay, I wi&s;h your Friend be &s;incere in his Profe&s;&s;ions to you; for my part, I greatly doubt it.</P>
<P>In a little time after this Accident, I perceiv'd my Friend began to look very melancholy; I endeavour'd to &s;ift the Secret from him, but to no manner of Purpo&s;e for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>One Day, as we were riding out to take the Air together, he &s;eem'd more deeply plung'd in Sorrow than u&s;ual. I told him, I &s;hould not take him for my Friend any longer, if he did not let me into the Cau&s;e of his Di&s;order. At la&s;t, with much Reluctance, he told me that the good Opinion he had before conceiv'd of my Wife was fal&s;e, for he was well a&s;&s;ur'd &s;he was not true to my Bed.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t imagine what a Thunder-clap this mu&s;t be to me, from a Friend who I was a&s;&s;ur'd in my &s;elf would not relate a Fal&s;ehood. It was &s;ome Moments before I could open my Mouth; and all the time of my Silence, he &s;eem'd &s;o much griev'd that he had declar'd the Secret to
<PB N="269" REF="278">
me, that I had no Doubt of the Truth of it.</P>
<P>When my Grief had given me Liberty of Speech, I begg'd he would give me the Foun|dation of his Su&s;picion; but he de&s;ir'd to be excus'd till he had certain Proof of her Infi|delity, which he did not doubt but he &s;hould &s;oon have, tho' it was what he wi&s;h'd to be deceiv'd in: And farther added, he would not have me take any Notice of it, but carry it fair to her, as if nothing had happen'd; for if you &s;hould, &s;aid he, you'll never come to the truth of the Matter.</P>
<P>I promis'd to comply with him, and went home; but Heaven knows with what a Heart.</P>
<P>I follow'd my Friend's Advice punctually, but yet could not help &s;howing the Di&s;content of my Mind in my Countenance. My Wife was mightily concern'd for my Melancholy, and was very pre&s;&s;ing to know the Cau&s;e; and in a very tender manner &s;eem'd to be di&s;quieted, which I took all for Art, and the Cunning of her Sex.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own to you, that &s;ometimes I imagin'd my Friend had deceiv'd me; but whenever we had an Opportunity of conver&s;ing, he &s;trength|en'd my Jealou&s;y to &s;uch a degree, that I began to wi&s;h the Cau&s;e of it no longer in this World. And if it had not been for my revenging my &s;elf on the &s;uppos'd Partner of her Guilt, I had cer|tainly taken Methods to di&s;patch her hence.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome Affairs to tran&s;act at <HI>Segovia</HI> every Year; and the time drawing on for my Journey, my Friend told me, before my Return I &s;hould have Demon&s;tration of her Infidelity; for, &s;aid he, your Ab&s;ence will give her the Opportu|nity &s;he wants, and &s;he'll be &s;ure to take hold of it.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="279">
It was a great while before I could be pre|vail'd upon by my Friend, to undertake really this Journey, but only to feign as if I had, that I might be convinc'd of her Perfidy, and puni&s;h it my &s;elf; but my Friend laid me down &s;o many Rea&s;ons for it, that I at la&s;t very unwillingly a|greed to go. But in the mean time, &s;aid he, you mu&s;t order that I may have Admittance in your Ab&s;ence, that I may take my Opportunity to ob&s;erve all Pa&s;&s;ages. Why, &s;aid I, I never knew you debarr'd the Liberty of my Hou&s;e. But you know, &s;aid he, &s;ince my fal&s;e Declaration of Love, to try your Wife's Virtue, &s;he has look'd upon me more like an Enemy than Friend, as knowing I was not &s;incere in my Pa&s;&s;ion; for Women, be they ever &s;o vicious, yet they abhor the Man that doubts their Virtue. Well then, &s;aid I, if you will, we'll &s;up together to-night; and then I'll take an Opportunity to leave Di|rections with my faithle&s;s Wife, to allow you the &s;ame Privileges in my Ab&s;ence, as you now have. Why then, return'd my Friend, don't you be &s;urpriz'd at what I &s;hall &s;ay to her.</P>
<P>We parted, and went to prepare every thing for my intended Journey. When I was at Din|ner with my Wife, I gave her &s;ome Hints con|cerning my Friend, and that I de&s;ir'd he &s;hould have Admittance in my Ab&s;ence; I ob&s;erv'd &s;he chang'd Colour at my Di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;eem'd to be in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, altho' I did not &s;eem to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Talk about indifferent Matters, &s;he told me, if I thought fit, &s;he intended to live private in my Ab&s;ence, and admit of no Vi&s;itors. For Sir, &s;aid &s;he, the World will be cen&s;orious, and receiving Vi&s;its from a Man, when you are from Home, is not con&s;i&s;ting with our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cu&s;toms. She found by my Di&s;cour&s;e that I was
<PB N="271" REF="280">
determin'd it &s;hould be &s;o, wherefore &s;he left off arguing upon that Subject: but I could perceive all the time we were together, my Re&s;olves &s;at very unea&s;y upon her; and it was with much Difficulty &s;he re&s;train'd her Tears. Her Sorrow &s;truck me to the Heart, and it was the greate&s;t &s;truggle I ever went through to keep my Tem|per: For I imagin'd all her Grief was to have this Spy upon her Actions.</P>
<P>When Night approach'd, my Friend came according to Appointment, and during our Sup|per, I told my Wife, &s;he was to look upon him as my only Friend, and give him the &s;ame Ad|mittance, as if it was my &s;elf, in every thing he &s;hould de&s;ire; well knowing (I told her) he would ask nothing contrary to our &s;trict Amity.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid my Friend, I am very &s;orry I can't comply with your De&s;ires; for I have receiv'd Letters from a near Relation at <HI>Panama,</HI> and I am obliged to attend his Nuptials, being he can't make proper Marriage Settlements with|out I am upon the Spot, and I fear I &s;hall hardly return this &s;ix Weeks. I was at fir&s;t very much &s;urpriz'd at this his &s;udden Re&s;oluti|on, and was going to &s;ay &s;omething upon't, till I ob&s;erv'd he wink'd at me. I then began to remember what he &s;aid to me in the Morning, that I &s;hould not take Notice of what he &s;aid. But I ob&s;erv'd, the Cloud upon my Wife's Face began to di&s;appear by degrees, which &s;eem'd to me the greate&s;t Proof of her Infide|lity. I was &s;o provok'd with the imaginary Wrong, that I could not help &s;hewing it in Words and Actions; but yet I had &s;o much Rea|&s;on in my Madne&s;s (for Pa&s;&s;ion is no le&s;s) that I conceal'd the real Clau&s;e.</P>
<P>My Wife &s;eem'd confounded at my incoherent Anger, having never &s;een my Fury before; and
<PB N="272" REF="281">
when my Friend was gone, begg'd I would tell her the real cau&s;e of my Unea&s;ine&s;s, for &s;he was well a&s;&s;ur'd &s;ome &s;ecret Cau&s;e had ruffled my Temper; but I per&s;i&s;ted in the Ob&s;tinacy of not di&s;covering it to her, and the next Day pur&s;u'd my Journey with a di&s;mal Idea of what was to come.</P>
<P>Thought had &s;o much impair'd my Strength, with its violent Workings, that I found it a dif|ficult thing to &s;it my Hor&s;e; and when I came to my Inn at Night, I was carry'd to Bed in a violent Feaver, and all Night was in a Deli|rium. My Servants &s;ent for a Phy&s;ician, who gave me &s;omething to re&s;i&s;t my Malady; and while he was with me, I utter'd &s;ome Words in my Ravings, that gave him to under&s;tand my Di&s;ea&s;e proceeded from the Mind. When I came to my &s;elf, I was &s;omething &s;urpriz'd to hear him &s;peak to me after this Manner.</P>
<P>Sir, I have &s;o long dealt with Di&s;ea&s;es of mo&s;t kinds, that I have Knowledge enough to per|ceive when they proceed from an ill habit of Body, or tho&s;e Maladies of the Mind that &s;light all Phy&s;ic; and be not amaz'd when I tell you, I have often cur'd the Latter by whol&s;ome Ad|vice. You are a young Man, and perhaps may have taken a wrong Conception of Things; if you will be pleas'd to tell me your Ca&s;e, I'll give you my Advice without a Fee; and don't think me impertinent to de&s;ire it, I have &s;een more Years than you. You may conceal your Name in your Relation, and if my Advice does not plea&s;e you, you are but ju&s;t where you were: I &s;hall be as faithful in keeping your Secret, as your Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>You may be a&s;&s;ur'd I was very much &s;ur|priz'd at his Proceeding, and I ea&s;ily per|ceiv'd a Sincerity in his Di&s;cour&s;e, that gain'd him my E&s;teem; and I was re&s;olv'd to let him
<PB N="273" REF="282">
into my Story; which I did, as much as I have to you.</P>
<P>After a Pau&s;e, he &s;aid I had ju&s;t come up to his Imagination of my Ca&s;e; and now Sir, (&s;aid he) I will proceed to my Advice. Con&s;ider well what you are about; you have confe&s;s'd, your Friend own'd to you he made pretended Love to your Wife to try her Virtue, and yet I don't find he advis'd with you about it before he had put his Device in Practice. To give you my Sentiments of this Matter, I believe your Friend to be fal&s;e to you, and that he really is in Love with your Wife. The Di&s;tre&s;s of your Spou&s;e, proceeded from her Indignation to him, and Love to you. His telling you, after his At|tempt upon her, was no more than to be the fir&s;t in the Declaration, as imagining &s;he would of cour&s;e inform you with it! her keeping it a Secret from you, was, not to make you unea&s;y; and his declaring his Su&s;picion of her Virtue af|terwards, was either to be reveng'd on her for &s;lighting his Pa&s;&s;ion, or to give him an Oppor|tunity in your Ab&s;ence to wrong your Wife.</P>
<P>This, in &s;hort, I fancy will prove the whole Truth. Neither is this Judgment hard to make, for I am apt to believe any di&s;intere&s;ted Per|&s;on would make the &s;ame Judgment; your Pa&s;|&s;ion has blinded yours; yet neverthele&s;s, if you can give your &s;elf time to think calmly, I don't in the lea&s;t doubt but you'll be of my Opinion. This I am a&s;&s;ur'd of, Jealou&s;y is a certain &s;ign of Love; and if you &s;hould in the heat of Pa&s;&s;ion do a ra&s;h Deed, every Moment of your Life will prove a Torment to you. Lovers Eyes are often fal&s;e, and too quick in fal&s;e Creations. Call Rea&s;on to your A&s;&s;i&s;tance; that will prove your be&s;t Friend. Take &s;ome time to think of my Advice and Coun&s;el; Friends may a&s;&s;oon prove fal&s;e as
<PB N="274" REF="283">
Wives, and you had better lo&s;e the former than the latter.</P>
<P>All the while he was &s;peaking, methought I was li&s;tening to an Oracle; and at the end of his Di&s;cour&s;e, I could not help blaming my &s;elf for my ra&s;h Belief. I call'd over in my Memo|ry every Moment of my Wife's Behaviour, and could not find any one Action &s;tart up, to give me that hard Opinion I had ra&s;hly conceiv'd a|gain&s;t her.</P>
<P>I return'd the Phy&s;ician of my Mind, as well as Body, many Thanks for his cordial Advice; and would have paid him in another Coin, but I could not prevail upon him to take a &s;ingle Dollar. No, &s;aid he, in accepting of your Mo|ney, I &s;hall make it appear, that, like Lawyers, I pleaded for my Fee. No Sir, all the Recom|pence I &s;hall ask of you, is only to let me know the Truth of every thing, when the Cata&s;tro|phe is over, which I hope will not affect your Wife; And if I might throw in one Word of Ad|vice more, if you prove the Friend you have &s;o much confided in to be fal&s;e, &s;hew your Re&s;ent|ment by &s;lighting him, and leave Revenge to Heaven. I promis'd to follow his judicious Ad|vice in every Thing, and &s;o we parted with a very good Regard for each other.</P>
<P>I was re&s;olved to proceed no farther on my Jour|ney, but make the be&s;t of my Way back again; and as I went along, con&s;ider of my Behaviour, and let Time alone for Proof. The Rea&s;on I gave my Servants for returning, was, that I had not Strength to pur&s;ue my Journey; which in Reality was no Fal&s;hood, for I was weak e|nough; and I am convinc'd, that Di&s;orders of the Mind weaken the Body more than habitual Di&s;tempers. In part of my Journey back, I could not come to any Re&s;olution how to be|have;
<PB N="275" REF="284">
and therefore re&s;olved to lye one more Night upon the Road, to &s;ee if my Pillow would advi&s;e me. When I arriv'd at my Inn, one of my Servants told me <HI>Don Roderigo</HI> was ju&s;t alighted. Hearing him nam'd, my Blood ran a wild Cour&s;e about my Body, and imme|diately it &s;truck to my Mind &s;omething was not right.</P>
<P>I ask'd my Servant, if <HI>Roderigo</HI> had &s;een him; he told me no, and that he &s;eem'd di&s;guis'd, as if he did not de&s;ire to be known. This &s;trengthen'd my Su&s;picion of &s;ome Ill intended, or done already, and that he was making his E&s;cape. I order'd my Servants not to appear: But when Supper was ready, I &s;ent for my Ho&s;t to bear me Company; where, after &s;ome trivial Di&s;cour&s;e, I ask'd him what Gue&s;ts he had in the Hou&s;e. He made no Scruple in telling me; but when he came to <HI>Don Roderigo,</HI> he declar'd he did not much like him; for he &s;eem'd very willing to be private with two of his Servants, and he had ob&s;erv'd 'em often whi&s;pering. They de&s;ign, &s;aid he, to be going very early in the Morning, but I don't know which Road they travel. I conceal'd my Di&s;turbance of Mind from my Ho&s;t, but re&s;olv'd to be going as ear|ly as <HI>Don Roderigo;</HI> and to be &s;ure of being early enough, I determin'd not to go to Bed, not|with&s;tanding the Weakne&s;s of my Body requir'd Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Night, I heard People whi&s;pering in the next Room, and I could ea|&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>Roderigo</HI>'s Voice: tho' I could gather little of their Di&s;cour&s;e, yet I could hear mine and my Wife's Name often mention'd.</P>
<P>At break of Day, I found they were prepar|ing to be gone; and tho' I was pretty expedi|tious, yet they were got out of the Inn, before
<PB N="276" REF="285">
I could get on Hor&s;e-back with my Servants. I was much vex'd at it, yet pur&s;u'd my Jour|ney homeward. But I was very much amaz'd, when about two Leagues from <HI>Lima,</HI> I met my Wife in a Coach with her Maid, and two <HI>In|dian</HI> Servants. The Servants, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;aw me, were overjoy'd, and my Wife could not o|pen her Mouth for &s;ome time. I then began to relap&s;e into my former Jealou&s;ie, and imagin'd &s;he was following <HI>Don Roderigo.</HI></P>
<P>At la&s;t &s;he open'd her Mouth with a great deal of Joy. Lord, my Dear (&s;aid &s;he) is it you in Reality, or are my Sen&s;es deceiv'd? I ask'd her the Rea&s;on of her Journey, and her mighty Surprize. Sir, an&s;wer'd &s;he, that Que|&s;tion confounds me; have I not a Letter from you, to come with all Speed imaginable? Here it is, continu'd &s;he. I took the Letter from her, and read the Contents.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PUr&s;uing my Journey, I had the Misfortune to fall from my Hor&s;e, and break my Arm, which pre|vents my writing to you. The Accident is attended with a violent Feaver, which I am told is very dan|gerous. I have refrain'd writing to you till now, as expecting &s;ome Amendment; but finding my &s;elf wor&s;e, I beg you will come to me with all the Ex|pedition imaginable, for fear you &s;hould never &s;ee me more alive.</P>

<P>There needed no Sphynx to unriddle this E|nigma; and I ob&s;erv'd, by my Wife's Counte|nance, we both knew the Author of the Let|ter. While we were confus'd, the Coachman that drove the Coach was &s;tealing away; but
<PB N="277" REF="286">
my Wife cry'd out to &s;top him, for that was the Me&s;&s;enger that brought the Letter to her; and farther told her, he was to conduct her to me, for the Coachman we had before was drown'd; and that Circum&s;tance 'deceiv'd her more than any thing el&s;e: The Fellow al&s;o told her that I had prevail'd with a Gentleman in the Neighbourhood where I lay hurt, to &s;end him to drive the Coach. I rid after the Fellow and brought him back, order'd him into the Coach|box, and forc'd him to drive out of the Road to a neighbouring Village, where liv'd a Gentle|man of my Acquaintance. He very unwillingly comply'd with my Commands; and we kept very clo&s;e to him, to prevent his making away. When we arriv'd at my Friend's Hou&s;e, we &s;ecur'd the Fellow in a &s;trong Room, and I left two of my <HI>Indian</HI> Servants to guard him. I made my Friend acquainted with the Accident, and that this Vi&s;it was not intended, but by meer Chance. He gave me to know I was welcome, let what would bring me there.</P>
<P>When my Wife and I with my Friend were alone, I tenderly embrac'd her, and begg'd her Pardon for my unju&s;t Su&s;picions of her Virtue, and related the whole Progre&s;s of my Jealou&s;ie, without omitting the lea&s;t Circum&s;tance. She gave thanks to Heav'n, for the Danger &s;he was &s;av'd from, and related to me the manner of her being deceiv'd by the Fellow that brought the Letter, as follows.</P>
<P>The fifth Day after you had left me, as I was mu&s;ing in the Garden, my Maid told me a Per&s;on had a Letter to deliver me from you. I began to tremble with timorous Apprehen&s;ion, and my whole Frame felt violent Di&s;orders. I or|der'd the Bearer to be brought to me; and when I had read the Letter, Grief lock'd up my
<PB N="278" REF="287">
Tongue, and I had not power to &s;peak for &s;ome time. When I had recover'd Speech, I ask'd the Fellow where you were. Madam, &s;aid he, he is at Don <HI>Florio</HI>'s Country-hou&s;e, <HI>(naming a Friend of mine, that my Wife had heard me often mention)</HI> and knowing you had never a Coach|man, my Ma&s;ter &s;ent me to conduct you to your Husband. I would not &s;pend time in dre&s;&s;ing my &s;elf, but ju&s;t as I was, with my Maid, and the two <HI>Indians,</HI> pur&s;u'd our Journey. I never once dream'd of any Treachery, tho' I always doubted your fal&s;e Friend; but as he had never been to vi&s;it me in your Ab&s;ence, it wip'd away all Su&s;picions of him. I ob&s;erv'd the Coachman, by his Looks, did not like the Company of my Servants, but I was too much concern'd for you to think of it much.</P>
<P>We congratulated one another again at our happy Deliverance, and admir'd the workings of Divine Providence, and the &s;econd Cau&s;e, my friendly Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>My Wife expre&s;s'd a great De&s;ire to &s;ee him, to return him Acknowledgments for his in&s;pir'd Advice, and in the Morning I promis'd her to go to him, if we could get any convenient Car|riage: For we were not very fond of making U&s;e of the Coachman that brought her out.</P>
<P>I defer'd his Examination till the next Day, being too much fatigu'd to do it then, tho' I order'd he &s;hould want nothing but his Liberty; for I con&s;ider'd him only as an In&s;trument to work his Ma&s;ter's Ends. When I was up in the Morning, I order'd him to be brought be|fore me; but after &s;ome time, they brought me Word he had made his E&s;cape, by creeping through the Cieling of the Room, and throw|ing down the Shingles; for it was a &s;ingle A|partment near the Garden. I was a little un|ea&s;y
<PB N="279" REF="288">
at his getting away, as well as my Wife, for fear his Ma&s;ter &s;hould make &s;ome Attempt upon us in the Hou&s;e where we were; it being a quarter of a Mile from the Village, and the Gentleman, my Friend, had but few Servants. Therefore it was thought the &s;afe&s;t Cour&s;e for us to go immediately to <HI>Lima.</HI> And a&s;&s;oon as we could procure Mules, we &s;et out, and reach'd that City without Mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>I heard nothing of the faithle&s;s <HI>Roderigo</HI> for &s;everal Days, neither did I think it &s;trange; for I imagin'd, if he had any Shame left, he would not dare to appear publickly at <HI>Lima;</HI> but if he did, I had re&s;olv'd to take my friendly&punc; Phy&s;i|cian's Advice, (which had prov'd &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful to me) to &s;how my Re&s;entment in &s;lighting him.</P>
<P>One Night, as &s;oft Repo&s;e had lock'd up our Sen&s;es, we were alarm'd from our downy Sleep, by a fearful cry of Fire! Fire! I ro&s;e, and ran into my Wife's Apartment, where &s;he remain'd frighted almo&s;t to death; and as People generally in the alarm of Fire know not what they do, &s;he ran to the Chamber where the Maids lay, and dre&s;s'd her&s;elf in her Servant's Cloaths; the Maid being equally frighted, when &s;he found &s;he had no Cloaths to put on, clap'd on her Mi|&s;tre&s;s's which I had brought after her, and was running down Stairs to free her&s;elf from the Danger. As &s;he was going through the Hall, I ob&s;erv'd four Men in Masks &s;eiz'd her, and car|ry'd her off. I follow'd with my Sword in my Hand, till one of the villanous Company came behind me, and run me through the Back. My Servants, who came after me, bore me in faint with lo&s;s of Blood; but by good Fortune the Wound did not prove dangerous, tho' well meant.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="289">
We could never come by the Truth how the Hou&s;e was &s;et on Fire, tho' it was &s;oon extin|gui&s;h'd; but we were a&s;&s;ur'd it mu&s;t be by &s;ome one of the Dome&s;tics. It was ea&s;y to judge Don <HI>Roderigo</HI> was the Cau&s;e on't, by running away with the Maid, as mi&s;taking her for my Wife, becau&s;e &s;he had in the Hurry put on her Mi|&s;tre&s;s's Cloaths and Vail.</P>
<P>I was advis'd, by my be&s;t Friends, to &s;ummon him before the &s;upream Judge, for it was dange|rous to let him go on with Impunity. But he would not obey the Summons, therefore he was de&s;ign'd to be out-law'd by due cour&s;e of Law. But as that takes up &s;everal Months, I was oblig'd to keep a Guard in my Hou&s;e; for I re|ceived &s;everal menacing Letters frequently from him, either thrown over the Wall, or left &s;o, that we could never &s;ecure any Per&s;on that brought 'em. While our Suit was going on, our new Vice-Roy arriv'd, who proving a Friend to Don <HI>Roderigo,</HI> a <HI>nolle pro&s;equi</HI> was i&s;&s;ued out, and I was obliged to &s;tand at the whole Charge of the Law-&s;uit. This violent and unju&s;t Pro|ceeding of the Vice-Roy's rais'd my Gaul to that degree, that I &s;aid many warm things again&s;t his Admini&s;tration, which came to his Knowledge: for there are generally poor-&s;pirited Wretches in all Governments, that have no other Merit than to improve Tales, and feed the Ears of their Su|periors with nau&s;eous Flattery and Lyes.</P>
<P>I was &s;ent for to the Vice-Roy, and examin'd concerning the&s;e Reports; and I &s;o far incens'd him with my Replies to his Que&s;tions, that if I had not met with &s;ome Friends that palliated the Matter, I don't know how far his Re&s;entment would have carry'd him. I was di&s;mi&s;s'd with my Liberty, but a multitude of Menaces, if for the future I ever gave my Tongue another loo&s;e;

and I &s;oon found the Effects of his Re&s;entment, by lo&s;ing a &s;mall Place in the Government; but as Providence had put me above wanting it, I was not much griev'd at the Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>My Wife begg'd me to remove from <HI>Lima,</HI> a Place where I had receiv'd &s;o many In&s;ults; and it was not improbable but I might receive more; which prov'd but too true.</P>
<P>In a few Days after I had appear'd before the Vice-Roy, the Maid that was forc'd away (by mi&s;taking her for my Wife) came home, mi&s;e|rably ill us'd, and brought me a Letter from the ungrateful Don <HI>Roderigo,</HI> which you may read if you plea&s;e: upon that he took the Letter out of his Pocket, and I found it as follows.</P>

<P>The In&s;olence of this Letter was not to be born, and I was as impatient to meet him, as he could be to meet with me; and I mu&s;t own to you, I thir&s;ted for his Blood, for his U&s;age was be|yond
<PB N="282" REF="291">
the nature of Man to bear. I examin'd the poor Girl of what &s;he knew of the Wretch, who inform'd me that they put her into a Coach, and carry'd her a League out of Town; but when they found their Mi&s;take, the U&s;age &s;he bore from 'em was in&s;upportable, and the Brute <HI>Rode|rigo</HI> told his Servants, if they pleas'd to make u&s;e of her in the vile&s;t Manner, they were wel|come. The Wretches that &s;erv'd &s;uch a Villain, mu&s;t have very near the &s;ame Sentiments of Ho|nour and Hone&s;ty, or they would &s;eek another Ma&s;ter; they were too forward to neglect &s;uch a Cruelty, and four of 'em by turns ravi&s;h'd her. Strangers to the nature of the Wretches, who are Superiors in this Part of the World, would imagine &s;uch Deeds &s;hould find Puni&s;hment by Law: But alas! Ju&s;tice is fled the Place, and we may expect more Mercy from the wor&s;t of Cannibals, than is to be found here.</P>
<P>The poor Creature in a little Time felt the farther Effects of their Cruelty; for they gave her a Di&s;temper that ended her Life.</P>
<P>Before her Death &s;he gave me Knowledge of the Place where they led her; for they had not any Caution in their villanous Proceeding, but a&s;&s;oon as they had gratify'd their Lu&s;t and Cru|elty, turn'd her out of Doors.</P>
<P>I had no farther need of any thing to whet my Revenge; but I mu&s;t own, the Death of this unfortunate poor Creature added Fuel to the Fire. My Wife was almo&s;t di&s;tracted at the un|happy Accident, and had no other Con&s;olation, but that &s;he had e&s;cap'd their cruel Hands.</P>
<P>I did not acquaint her with my Intention of &s;eeking this Villain, but I made it my only Bu|&s;ine&s;s; I went to the Place the poor Maid had directed me, where I had Information that he had left the Place, and now re&s;ided in <HI>Lima.</HI> I was

<P>I cho&s;e St. <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI>'s Field, for the Conveniency of a &s;mall Publick-hou&s;e which over-look'd it, where I went before Day, that I might di&s;co|ver if he came alone; for I had but little rea&s;on to expect fair Play from &s;uch a Villain. When the time came, I &s;aw him go by the Hou&s;e a|lone; I let him pa&s;s by me, to &s;ee if he was not follow'd by any of his cur&s;ed Crew; but finding none, I ha&s;ted after him, into the middle of the Field, and call'd to him; he turn'd about, and with the Image of Hell in his Face, he cry'd, I thought your Re&s;entment would have brought you fir&s;t into the Field: But as I am here before you, it &s;peaks me no Coward, tho' your vile Scrawl would intimate as much. Come, &s;aid I, no Words, thy Breath is Poi&s;on to me, it will in&s;ect the Air; Only this Sir, &s;aid he, as you had not nam'd any particular Weapon, I have made bold to bring a pair of Pi&s;tols with me, and to let you &s;ee I have &s;ome Honour, you &s;hall take your Choice. I gave him no An&s;wer, but took one, and we agreed to &s;tand at &s;uch a Di&s;tance. As I was going to Fire, he cry'd out
<PB N="284" REF="293">
Hold! I will tell you one Secret more before we engage, and that's this; Your Pi&s;tol is only charg'd with Powder, but mine with Ball, which I put in &s;ince you made the Choice; and now prepare for Death, be a&s;&s;ur'd this is the la&s;t Moment of thy Life. I did not give my &s;elf time to an&s;wer, but fir'd my Pi&s;tol, and then hurl'd it at him, and had the good Fortune to cut him in the Face with it; and in the Con|fu&s;ion and Surprize his Pi&s;tol went off without hurting me. Now, &s;aid I, thou Wretch! we are once more on equal Terms, and Heav'n I hope will favour the ju&s;te&s;t Cau&s;e. We drew, and in a few Pa&s;&s;es I laid him for dead on the Ground; tho' in the Encounter I had receiv'd a dange|rous Wound in the Brea&s;t. I went home, not|with&s;tanding my Hurt, and &s;ent &s;ecretly for a Surgeon of my Acquaintance, who dre&s;s'd me, and told me I was in no Danger.</P>
<P>My Wife was very much griev'd at the Accident, tho' &s;he could not but be pleas'd at <HI>Roderigo</HI>'s Death; yet her Fears increas'd, as imagining I &s;hould &s;uffer for it, by the violent Temper of the Vice-roy: But her Grief began to blow over, when in &s;everal Days after, no Enquiry was made, nor even any Notice taken of his Death.</P>
<P>I was very much &s;urpriz'd at it, imagining I had really kill'd him.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as my Wound was well, I went to the little Hou&s;e to enquire if they knew any thing of the Body; (for the Owner of the Hou&s;e was formerly my Servant, and a Man of much Pro|bity, who knew all my Story;) he inform'd me, that a little while after I pa&s;t by his Hou&s;e home again, five Per&s;ons ran that way, and coming to the Body, &s;eem'd to mourn over it, and went the Road that leads to St. <HI>Dominick; a Village a|bout half a Mile from the Place where we fought.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="294">
I imagin'd they had bury'd him privately in that Village, and went home to acquaint my Wife, who &s;har'd my Contentment.</P>
<P>I now went abroad as I was wont, and all the Di&s;cour&s;e was of Don <HI>Roderigo</HI>'s &s;udden di&s;ap|pearing. Servants and all had left his Hou&s;e, but no one &s;u&s;pected any thing of his Death. Some of my Acquaintance told me, they imagin'd this to be &s;ome Trick of his, and that he only lay dormant to meditate &s;ome Mi&s;chief to me.</P>
<P>I &s;eem'd to come into their Fears, but in my Mind &s;lighted their Advice, as imagining I had nothing to fear. I pa&s;t on a whole Month without any Danger at all; but as I was going one Day acro&s;s the Bridge to a Warehou&s;e I had in the Suburbs, a Fellow came up to me, and privately ask'd me if I would be his Chap|man for &s;ome <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods. He told me a long Story, that he was oblig'd to make up a Cargo and leave this Part of the World, for his Credit began to fail, and if he did not get away &s;peedily, his Creditors would lay him up. We went to a neighbouring Tavern, where he read me his Bill of Parcels. He told me he had been encourag'd to offer his Goods to me, from the fairne&s;s of my Character; and was co|ming to wait on me when he had the good Fortune to meet me. The next Day was a|greed on for me to go and view the Goods, for I was not to pay for 'em till they were en|ter'd my Warehou&s;e. Accordingly, as appoint|ed, I went to the Hou&s;e of the Per&s;on, in the <HI>Benedictine</HI> Street. I was &s;hown into a Room till the Goods were brought; but as I was look|ing on &s;ome Paintings, five Men ru&s;h'd out of a Clo&s;et in the Room, and &s;eiz'd me. They di&s;arm'd me, took out every thing that was in my Pockets, went out, and lock'd me in.
<PB N="286" REF="295">
You may imagine the Surprize I was in, which was very much increas'd when I &s;aw my Ene|my <HI>Don Roderigo</HI> enter the Room. I in my Con|fu&s;ion thought I had &s;een a Gho&s;t, for he look'd very pale; but he &s;oon convinc'd me of the con|trary. And have I got you at la&s;t? &s;aid he: I now will revenge my &s;elf at lei&s;ure; but to compleat my Revenge, I have &s;ent a Token for your Wife, that I may ravi&s;h her before thy Face; and then I'll devi&s;e Tortures to rack e|very Joint about thee. He gave me to know that he had &s;ent my Watch for a Token, and that &s;he would bring &s;uch a Sum of Money to pay for the Goods. The Torment of my Soul no Tongue can expre&s;s; and I am a&s;&s;ur'd, if they had not taken my Sword from me, I had put an End to my wretched Life.</P>
<P>The inhumane Villain in&s;ulted me &s;o much, that I ru&s;h'd upon him, unarm'd as I was, and had certainly choak'd him, if his wicked A&s;|&s;i&s;tants had not dragg'd me from him.</P>
<P>It is well, &s;aid he, I have no other Pa&s;&s;ion but Lu&s;t reigning in my Brea&s;t at this In&s;tant; but when I have &s;ated my De&s;ires on thy Wife, I'll then add another Pang for this U&s;age; but in the mean time I'll leave you to think of this Matter alone, for I fancy you don't much care for my Company.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as he had made an End of this Speech, he and his Gang went out, and fa&s;ten'd the Door on the other &s;ide. I'll give you Leave to imagine the Confu&s;ion of my Thoughts. I remain'd &s;ome time without moving; but acci|dentally ca&s;ting my Eyes on the Door, I ob|&s;erv'd there was a Bar to &s;hut it on the in|&s;ide. I immediately barr'd it, and began to look about to &s;ee if I could find any thing for my Defence; but to my Grief could perceive no|thing.
<PB N="287" REF="296">
I enter'd the Clo&s;et, and &s;earch'd there, but to no purpo&s;e. Looking upon the Floor of the Clo&s;et, I perceiv'd one of the Boards &s;eem'd to be loo&s;e: I e&s;&s;ay'd to pull it up, but wanted &s;ome Engine to effect it. I at la&s;t thought of the Bar of the Door, ran to it, and by main Force wrench'd it from the Staple; for I thought if it would not &s;erve me to make my E|&s;cape, it would &s;erve me to defend my &s;elf: but I ea&s;ily forc'd up the Board, and with my Bar beat down the Ceiling under me. I was re&s;olv'd to explore the hidden Place, whatever was the Con&s;equence; for it could not be wor&s;e than to remain where I was. I therefore ventur'd down, though &s;omething of a difficult De&s;cent; for the Joyces were &s;o clo&s;e together, I had much ado to force my Body through; but at la&s;t, with much Difficulty, I pre&s;s'd through, and had a de&s;perate Fall to the Ground.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found I had got into a Cooper's Col|lar, for there were &s;everal Pipe-&s;taves, and Tools to work with. I &s;eiz'd upon &s;ome of them, and by Force wrench'd open the Cellar-Door, which led me once more into the Street before <HI>Don Roderigo</HI>'s Hou&s;e. I did not give my &s;elf Time to con&s;ider, but ran towards the Bridge to get to my own Hou&s;e; and ju&s;t as I enter'd the <HI>Cordeliers</HI> Street, I met my Wife with her Maid, and the Wretch that had de|coy'd me to the Hou&s;e. I ran upon him, &s;eiz'd him by the Throat, and flung him over the Bridge, where he met with the Reward of his Villany. I had not Power of Speech to inform my Wife of the Accident, but made Signs for her to go home. By this time it was dark; and the profligate Villain <HI>Don Roderigo,</HI> fancy|ing his cur&s;ed Emi&s;&s;ary &s;taid too long, came out of his Door which fac'd the Bridge. A&s;|&s;oon
<PB N="288" REF="297">
as I di&s;cover'd him, I ran towards him, and &s;eiz'd him: Now Villain, &s;aid I, I will not part with thee till thou ha&s;t render'd up thy Soul to Hell. We both &s;truggled, and I kept him down; but the re&s;t of his Company coming up to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I quitted him; and run|ring to &s;ee if I could meet with &s;ome one arm'd, I had the good Fortune to light on you. A&s;|&s;oon as I receiv'd your Sword, I ran back, and ju&s;t met the Villain as he was entring his Door. I ran the Weapon into his very Heart; and I believe you were a better Witne&s;s of his Death than my &s;elf, being you were found near the Body.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as I &s;aw him fall I made the be&s;t of my way home, not imagining you would meet with any farther Damage than the Lo&s;s of your Sword.</P>
<P>The Darkne&s;s of the Night, I fancy, con|ceal'd me from the Servants that came to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Ma&s;ter, for I never once was &s;u&s;pected; or perhaps if they did know me, Fear kept 'em from di&s;covering me.</P>
<P>When I heard of your Tryal, I came my &s;elf into Court, and if you had been condemn'd, re|&s;olv'd to have di&s;cover'd the Truth; but finding you were to be bani&s;hed to <HI>Baldivia,</HI> I conceal'd the Fact, imagining I had it in my Power to gain your Freedom, by paying your Ran&s;om; which was the Rea&s;on I came now to wait up|on you, to offer you my Service in that, or any thing el&s;e that lies in my Power. I return'd him Thanks for his Offer; and con&s;idering his Story, I told him I was glad I was in &s;ome &s;ort an In&s;trument of his Revenge. He would force upon me a Ring, and two hundred Pie|ces of Gold, and begg'd he might be rank'd in the Number of my Friends. He made me ma|ny

<P>He accompany'd me on Board when our Ve&s;|&s;el was to &s;et Sail, putting in the Captain's Hands fre&s;h Provi&s;ion, and &s;everal &s;orts of good Liquor to comfort me in my Voyage.</P>
<P>I had the Happine&s;s to have Pirates for my Fel|low-Suflerers; and the Viceroy had given out, to take off all Cen&s;ure from him, that I encou|rag'd 'em in their Piracy.</P>
<P>We took our Leaves, with Prote&s;tations of a la&s;ting Friend&s;hip; and I liv'd as merrily as I could, till the Day we had the good Fortune to meet with you, which has not given me a|ny Rea&s;on to change my Humour.</P>

<P>WE were mightily diverted with the Rela|tion of <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> and I found I was not de|ceiv'd when I took him for a Man that un|der&s;tood the World.</P>
<P>We had now gain'd the Streights of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and had enter'd the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea: But I mu&s;t confe&s;s I could not &s;ee the <HI>African</HI> Shore, without Numbers of Sighs for Misfortunes pa&s;t; and I found my Griefs renew'd with the Remembrance: And all the Mitigation I had was the affectionate Concern from <HI>Don Ferdinand,</HI> to whom I had told my whole Story. We had not made a Day's Sail in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> ere we perceiv'd two Sail making towards us. I mu&s;t own I had no De|&s;ire to engage, being &s;o richly laden; and there|fore, by the Advice of both the Ships Com|pany, made all the Sail I could to avoid 'em. But our Ve&s;&s;els being foul with &s;o long a Voy|age, and never once clean'd during our whole
<PB N="290" REF="299">
Cour&s;e, they gain'd upon us, do what we could. When we found there was no getting from 'em without Fighting, we were as much deter|min'd on the other Hand to fight our Ships to the Bottom of the Sea rather than &s;urren|der. Having fix'd this Re&s;olution, we prepar'd for the Engagement; and when we had got all Things in Readine&s;s, we le&s;&s;en'd our Sails that they might come up to us. I order'd every Sailor to load as many &s;mall Arms as they could, and not to fire a Gun till I gave 'em Orders; but a&s;&s;oon as ever they had fir'd the great Guns, to di&s;charge their &s;mall Arms up|on 'em. I could not prevail upon <HI>Don Ferdi|nand</HI> to keep below, though I &s;aw Fear livelily painted in his Face. When they came within Pi&s;tol-&s;hot of our Ship they hail'd us, and com|manded us to &s;trike immediately. We made no other An&s;wer than with our Guns and &s;mall Arms, which &s;urpriz'd 'em, and did 'em a great deel of Damage in their Rigging; for cutting the Top&s;ail Halliards with our Shot, the Top|&s;ail fell down upon the Cap, and hinder'd their Ship's Way very much; and I believe we might have made our E&s;cape. But I perceiv'd the <HI>Villars</HI> was hard put to it, (our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of War, whom I had nam'd the <HI>Villars</HI> in Re|membrance of that dear One.) By this time we were prepar'd again, and I order'd every Man, a&s;&s;oon as they had di&s;charg'd, to lye flat upon their Bellies till we had receiv'd the Fire of the Enemy; which accordingly we did. They fir'd in upon us&punc; but kill'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> not one Man. Then our Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e up all together, and fir'd in our &s;mall Shot. We had &s;o damag'd their Rigging with this Broad&s;ide, that we fell a&s;tern till we were charg'd again; and then I gave our Men Orders to fire into the Body of the Ship, and point their Guns low on pur|po&s;e;
<PB N="291" REF="300">
which we &s;oon found had the de&s;ir'd Effect: For they had &s;everal Shots between Wind and Water, &s;o that they were oblig'd to heel the Ship on the Starboard Side, to prevent the Water running in on the Larboard. I &s;eeing there was not much to be fear'd from her, bore down to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Villars,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he was over-match'd. But when her Antagoni&s;t found my De&s;ign, and under&s;tood the Condition of the other Ship, &s;he made all the Sail &s;he could, and fled for it. We did not think fit to follow her, but &s;ent a Boat on Board, to enquire how it &s;tood with 'em in the <HI>Villars.</HI> They &s;ent me Word they had lo&s;t eight Men, had three wounded, and were very much mawl'd in their Rigging, as well as their Hull, and had receiv'd a Shot be|tween Wind and Water, and the Ship leak'd very much. I bad 'em &s;earch for it; but there was no coming at it; therefore I order'd them to get out as many of the Goods as they could, and bring them on Board me. The Weather pro|ving very favourable, they went to Work as fa&s;t as they could.</P>
<P>Our Men brought me Word that the Ship we had engag'd was &s;inking. They fir'd &s;eve|ral Guns for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and their Con&s;ort be|ing almo&s;t out of Sight, I bore down to help them all I could; but before we could come to 'em &s;he &s;unk to the Bottom. The Men had put out their Long-boat and Barge, and were got in them, and made towards us. A&s;&s;oon as they came within hearing, they call'd out for <HI>Quarter,</HI> which I promis'd 'em they &s;h uld have. There were 123 of 'em; and as their Number exceeded ours, we were oblig'd to confine 'em, for fear they &s;hould take it in their Heads to &s;et upon us.</P>
<P>The Captain was kill'd in the Engagement, but the Lieutenant inform'd me they were two
<PB N="292" REF="301">
Men of War, of forty Guns each, &s;et out from <HI>Barcelona</HI> to crui&s;e upon the Coa&s;t; and mann'd each with two hundred Men: But the re&s;t of their Crew were either kill'd, or being wound|ed &s;unk with the Ship. I did not think it pro|per to carry 'em to <HI>Italy,</HI> for fear it &s;hould prove prejudicial to <HI>Don Antonio;</HI> and under|&s;tanding that in removing the Goods on Board the <HI>Villars,</HI> they had found out the Leak and &s;topp'd it, I intended to put 'em on board her, and give 'em the Ship with their Liberty; but fir&s;t I order'd out the Guns and Ammunition, and her Goods, leaving 'em nothing but Provi&s;ion and Water, which they return'd me many Thanks for, and &s;o we parted.</P>
<P>The next Day there aro&s;e &s;uch a Storm as we had never felt before, and continu'd in the utmo&s;t Violence for fourteen Days, &s;o that now we were in Danger of drowning; and I believe mo&s;t would have parted with their Wealth to have been &s;afe on Shore. At la&s;t we di&s;cover'd Land, but were very much &s;urpriz'd to find it <HI>Candia,</HI> for now we began to be in fear of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Pirates. So we re&s;olv'd to &s;teer for <HI>Zant</HI> as fa&s;t as we could, and there make Dividend of our Prize-Money and Goods. And accor|dingly we arriv'd there &s;afely, <HI>Sept.</HI> 3. 1696.</P>
<P>This I&s;land of <HI>Zant</HI> belongs to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> therefore we were out of Danger from the <HI>Turks.</HI> The Town, which bears the &s;ame Name with the I&s;land, is above a Mile in Length, &s;eat|ed upon a Beach of the Bay. It is built mo&s;t|ly of Stone, and has a noble Look from the Sea. To the We&s;t of the Town &s;tands the Ca|&s;tle, built on a high and very &s;teep Hill, where mo&s;t of the Merchants dwell, and is very near as big as the City below. It is a Bi&s;hop's See, and the Governour is of the Nobility of <HI>Venice.</HI>
<PB N="293" REF="302">
The chief Commodities they deal in are Wine, Oyl, and Currants, which are e&s;teem'd of the be&s;t Growth. They grow on Vines like other Grapes, and are gather'd in <HI>July,</HI> and then pack'd in Hog&s;heads ready for the Merchants.</P>
<P>Our Men being well pleas'd they were out of Danger, and in a Place where Wine was to be bought cheap, traffick'd &s;o much for that Commodity, that mo&s;t of them fell into dange|rous Di&s;ea&s;es; therefore I re&s;olv'd to leave <HI>Zant,</HI> and make for <HI>Sapienza,</HI> an I&s;land with a good Harbour, not inhabited, where they would not be under the like Temptation; &s;o we came to an Anchor there, <HI>Sept.</HI> 8. I order'd twelve Guns on Shore, and rais'd a Platform capable of de|fending us from the in&s;ults of an Enemy. In a plea&s;ant Green we put up a large Tent, and o|thers &s;maller by it for the Officers and Sailors: But I having but one Bed put up on Shore, <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> was forc'd to lie with me, tho' as I thought very unwillingly. Our &s;haring the ready Money took us up four Days. I re&s;erv'd a fourth Part to my Owners, which amounted to upwards of &s;ixty thou&s;and Pound; and a twelfth Part for my &s;elf, which, with what Pre&s;ents and o|ther Things that I had, amounted to the value of fifty thou&s;and Pound. Every Sailor from fir&s;t to la&s;t &s;har'd above twelve hundred Pound a|piece; but when we came to divide the Goods, we knew not which way to go about it; &s;o with one common Con&s;ent of the Sailors, I was oblig'd to accept of them, without paying one Penny for them.</P>
<P>We &s;et Sail for <HI>O&s;tia</HI> the next Day, after we had fini&s;h'd our Dividend, and arriv'd there <HI>Nov.</HI> 1. af|ter a Voyage of two Years and &s;even Months, and the riche&s;t Prize that ever came into any Port of <HI>Italy.</HI> I &s;ent a Letter to <HI>Don Antonio,</HI> to give him
<PB N="294" REF="303">
Notice of my Arrival, and Advice to come and take Care of his Cargo. In two Days, he, <HI>Don|na I&s;abella,</HI> and their little Son came on Board in a Plea&s;ure-Boat. I found they were in Mourning, and I told 'em I was afraid to ask 'em who it was for; they inform'd me that <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Father had been dead above two Years, but they had re&s;olv'd never to wear any other Colour, till they had &s;een me. Never was a more tender Meeting between Friends, than between us; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, for &s;ome time all my Cares lay hu&s;h'd.</P>
<P>When I came to inform <HI>Don Antonio</HI> of the Wealth I had brought him home, he &s;tood a|maz'd: For be&s;ides the Money which I told him of, the Goods I had on Board exceeded in value the Freight I went out with. I could hardly prevail upon him to accept of &s;uch a Sum of Money, till I inform'd him it was but bare|ly his Due, and that I had very near as much to my own Share.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ented <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> to <HI>Antonio</HI> and his Lady, who &s;eem'd very much pleas'd with him; and <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> out of his free merry Humour, told me he hop'd I would not forget him, be|cau&s;e he was older, for he thought he had more Right to my Friend&s;hip than <HI>Don Ferdinand,</HI> being he was an older Acquaintance. I let 'em into &s;ome of his Life and Humour: they re|ceiv'd him yery friendly; and we all went to <HI>Don Antonio</HI>'s <HI>Villa</HI> together.</P>
<P>After &s;taying a Week, I began to be tir'd with &s;o much Plea&s;ure, and therefore begg'd Leave of <HI>Don Antonio</HI> to vi&s;it <HI>Rome,</HI> only to &s;hew <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> that celebrated Place. <HI>Don Antonio</HI> &s;ent before to his Palace to prepare for our Reception, and the next Day we follow'd. We vi&s;ited all the Rarities, ancient and mo|dern,
<PB N="295" REF="304">
where we might &s;ee the Grandeur of the antient <HI>Romans</HI> by tho&s;e &s;tupendous Ruins &s;till left. As <HI>Rome</HI> was formerly a Nur&s;ery of War and Greatne&s;s, it is now a Nur&s;ery of Arts, but chief|ly Painting, Architecture, and Mu&s;ick. There have flouri&s;h'd in one Century, <HI>Lanfranio, Domi|nichino, Pietro du Cortona,</HI> the <HI>Po&s;&s;ine's, Cama&s;&s;ei, Guercin da Cento, Chivoli, Andrea Sacchi,</HI> the im|mortal <HI>Raphael, Hannibal Carac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e, Guide Rene, Mutiano,</HI> and many more excellent in the Art of Painting.

<P>I &s;hall not &s;ay any thing more of <HI>Rome,</HI> nor of <HI>Naples,</HI> where we went once more, upon <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI>'s Account. I would have per&s;ua|ded him to have begun his Studies at <HI>Rome,</HI> (for I &s;uppos'd him a <HI>Roman Catholick)</HI> but he would not hear of it, and begg'd he might go with me into <HI>England,</HI> which I promis'd him he &s;hould.</P>
<P><HI>Donna I&s;abella</HI> had an Orphan Cou&s;in, that liv'd with her, of a va&s;t Fortune, beautiful to a Miracle; who having &s;een Don <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> fell de&s;perately in Love with him. But he did not &s;eem to have the lea&s;t Regard for her. <HI>Don Antonio,</HI> di&s;cover'd to me the Secret, and pity|ing by Experience his Kin&s;woman, de&s;ir'd I would foward the Match. But when <HI>Don Fer|dinand</HI> under&s;tood my De&s;ires, he fell upon his Knees, and begg'd I would never mention it
<PB N="296" REF="305">
more; for he had made a &s;olemn Re&s;olution never to marry any Woman breathing. I pre&s;s'd him all I could, and laid the Folly of &s;uch a ra&s;h Re&s;olve before him; but it was preaching to a Tempe&s;t; and all my Arguments had no Power upon him. On the other hand, the merry <HI>Don Pedro</HI> was as deep in Love with <HI>Donna Felicia,</HI> which was the Name of the Orphan Lady. But his man|ner of Court&s;hip was &s;o odd, and out of the way, that he caus'd more Diver&s;ion than we could have imagin'd. If &s;he went to Bed, he would lay him&s;elf down at her Chamber Door, and &s;ing Songs all Night; that if &s;he had any Inclinati|on to have re&s;ted, he was re&s;olv'd &s;he &s;hould not; and he would often &s;ay, he intended to plague her into a Complyance. If &s;he went into the Garden, he was &s;ure to follow her clo&s;e; or even at Church, he would often tell her, it was in vain to pray for a Ble&s;&s;ing from Heaven, when &s;he was committing Murder with every Look. In &s;hort, he would often force a Smile from the afflicted Lady her &s;elf.</P>
<P>I was &s;till endeavouring with <HI>Don Ferdinand,</HI> to forget his ra&s;h Vow: But he de&s;ir'd me, in &s;uch moving T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ms, not to intreat him further, that I re&s;olv'd never to trouble him any more on that Theme. Notwith&s;tanding which, I begg'd of <HI>Donna I&s;abella</HI> to try what &s;he could do with him, for I imagin'd Complai&s;ance might work more upon him than Friend&s;hip. She &s;ent for him into her Clo&s;et, and they remain'd together &s;everal Hours; and I was very much pleas'd the next Day to &s;ee him walking in the Garden, only with <HI>Donna Felicia.</HI> I did not think it proper to interrupt them; but when I had an Opportunity, I declar'd my Satisfaction, and told him I ea&s;ily forgave his not complying with me, and yielding to the Per&s;wa&s;ion of
<PB N="297" REF="306">
<HI>Donna I&s;abella.</HI> He &s;eem'd in &s;ome Confu&s;ion at what I &s;aid to him, which I attributed to his denying me, and his Conde&s;cen&s;ion to <HI>Donna I&s;abella.</HI> But in a few Days after that, I was &s;omething more &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee <HI>Don Pedro</HI> eager|ly addre&s;&s;ing <HI>Donna Felicia,</HI> and &s;he regarding him more favourably than u&s;ual.

If &s;o, re|turn'd <HI>Donna I&s;abella,</HI> we may hope your Pa&s;|&s;ion is bury'd long &s;ince. I told her, I did not Love like others, for I was re&s;olv'd to carry mine with me to the Grave. By what I have formerly heard (return'd <HI>Donna I&s;abella)</HI> from you, as well as my Husband, you have not the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of Hopes.

</LETTER>
<P>I wrote this Letter in the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Language, and &s;hew'd it to <HI>Don Ferdinand,</HI> who approv'd of what I had written.</P>
<P>I had di&s;pos'd of the re&s;t of my Goods on Board, and the Money amounted to upwards of fifteen thou&s;and Pound; but I could not pre|vail
<PB N="299" REF="308">
upon <HI>Don Antonio</HI> to accept of one Pen|ny.</P>
<P>No, my dear Friend, &s;aid he, you have alrea|dy brought me the Fortune of a Nobleman; tho' it is not worldly Wealth I covet. I have all the Earth contains in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my adorable Wife: and even that, my greate&s;t Hap|pine&s;s, is owing to you; and all the Allay of Joy I have, is, that I cannot &s;ee you as ble&s;t as I am. But, continu'd he, Time that wears out all things, will, I hope, cure this amorous Sickne&s;s of your Soul. I let him know my Grief was as fix'd as De&s;tiny, and I had nothing el&s;e to do but to wing to the Place where the Joy of my Life did once re&s;ide; with this only Hope, that the lively Imagination of my Lo&s;s would put an end to all my Sorrows, by &s;ink|ing me into the Arms of Death.</P>
<P>He was &s;o very much concern'd for me that he could not avoid &s;hedding Tears; and us'd all the Arguments he could to per&s;uade me to re&s;ide in <HI>Italy.</HI> I told him I had more Rea|&s;ons to go for my native Country than what I had given him, and that was the Education of young <HI>Don Ferdinand,</HI> who begg'd to cultivate his Studies in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I turn'd all my Money into Bills of Ex|change, well knowing the Ca&s;ualties that attend Travellers; and I intended to go by Land to <HI>Flanders,</HI> with <HI>Don Ferdinand,</HI> my two faithful <HI>Indians,</HI> and one Servant more.</P>
<P>All my <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Sailors that I had pick'd up by the Way, had by my Con&s;ent their Di&s;|charge, and were gone to their &s;everal Homes, in Circum&s;tances beyond their Expectations; though they all declar'd, if I intended another Voyage, they would never for&s;ake me. Some
<PB N="300" REF="309">
of my <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sailors had married <HI>Italian</HI> Wo|men, and &s;o de&s;ign'd to &s;ettle in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>When I de&s;ir'd <HI>Don Antonio</HI> to take Charge of the Ship, he told me he had nothing to do with it, declaring it was mine, and therefore de&s;ir'd I would make no more Words about it; for, &s;aid he, you don't know but you may meet with &s;omething to change your Mind, and we may have the Satisfaction of &s;eeing you once more.</P>
<P>In a few Days after this, the Nuptials were celebrated between <HI>Don Pedro</HI> and <HI>Donna Felicia,</HI> who de&s;ign'd for <HI>Spain</HI> (a&s;&s;oon as I left <HI>Ita|ly)</HI> where he intended to take up the Mortgage of his E&s;tate, the Time being almo&s;t expir'd. I mu&s;t own, the Uncertainty of Women's Tem|pers gave me much Cogitation; and I thought this Marriage was a very odd Thing.</P>
<P>I now began to think of my Journey; but fir&s;t I order'd a Gold&s;mith to make me every way the &s;ame Parcel of Plate as I received as a Pre&s;ent from <HI>Don Jaques de Ramires,</HI> which I pre&s;ented to <HI>Donna I&s;abella,</HI> that &s;he might re|member me. She gave me many Thanks for it, but &s;eem'd very unwilling to accept of it a great while. I told her, as merrily as I could, if &s;he made any more Words about it, I would return her the Ship that bore her Name, and would be no longer under her Command. Well, &s;aid &s;he, I'll accept 'em; but as you allow me to be your Owner, I'll give you Orders in Wri|ting, that you mu&s;t not break open till you come in &s;uch a Latitude, that is, a Fortnight after you are &s;ettled in <HI>England.</HI> I promis'd to obey her punctually. The next Day &s;he gave me a &s;eal'd Paper, which &s;he told me were the Orders &s;he mention'd.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="310">
I had given my Lieutenant Charge of the Ship, with Directions to make for <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> with all the Expedition practicable.</P>
<P>The next Day, being <HI>Feb.</HI> 6. 1696, I took my Leave of all my Acquaintance; and notwith|&s;tanding I am not us'd to weep, could not forbear &s;hedding &s;ome Tears at parting with &s;uch true Friends as <HI>Don Antonio</HI> and his Lady had prov'd. I rode the fir&s;t Day overwhelm'd with Melan|choly, and not one Thought of being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;uch a Fortune, from nothing, in &s;o &s;hort a Time, ever enter'd my Brea&s;t. But &s;eeing <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> by his Countenance partake of my Sor|row, I was forc'd to appear le&s;s melancholy, to oblige him to be &s;o too.</P>
<P>I would have &s;hewn him the Rarities of <HI>Ita|ly</HI> in our Travels, but he &s;eem'd very little in|clin'd to Curio&s;ity: And we arriv'd at <HI>Antwerp</HI> without any Adventure. We &s;taid &s;ome time there to recover the Fatigue of our Journey, but more upon <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI>'s Account, being he was &s;omething indi&s;pos'd, having never tra|vell'd on Hor&s;e-back &s;o far before.</P>
<P>As we approach'd the Town, he and my <HI>In|dians</HI> were &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee the Manner of Beg|ging. The Boys and Girls would run before you, and of a &s;udden &s;top &s;hort, &s;tand upon their Heads, and clap their Hands, &s;aying their Prayers all the while.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Antwerp</HI> is finely &s;eated upon the River <HI>Scheld;</HI> it is very well fortify'd, and upon the Walls are planted Trees that give an agree|able Shade, and make it plea&s;ant Walking. The Ca&s;tle, both &s;trong and beautiful, was founded by the Duke of <HI>Alva.</HI> The City in Bigne&s;s may compare with <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> their Streets &s;pacious, and Hou&s;es very magnificent. The Church of <HI>Sancta Maria,</HI> their Cathedral, is a &s;uperb Build|ing;
<PB N="302" REF="311">
and of that Neatne&s;s, that the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, of <HI>Germany,</HI> would often &s;ay <HI>it was only fit to be kept in a Ca&s;e.</HI> The In&s;ide is as glorious and neat as the Out. The Paintings were perform'd by Sir <HI>Peter Paul Rubens,</HI> an In|habitant of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and are equal to any thing that ever he did. The Je&s;uits Church is al&s;o very beautiful, adorn'd with abundance of curi|ous Marble Pillars, and all the Pannels painted by the &s;ame Hand as the other. There are &s;e|veral more beautiful Churches and Chappels; but as the&s;e mention'd are the chief, we &s;hall take no farther Notice of 'em.</P>
<P>The third of <HI>April,</HI> (having pretty well reco|ver'd our Fatigue by a Re&s;t of ten Days) we &s;et out for <HI>Calais,</HI> being the &s;horte&s;t Cut to <HI>Dover,</HI> and arriv'd there <HI>April</HI> 6; making &s;hort Stages.</P>
<P>From this Place we might behold the white Cliffs of <HI>Dover.</HI> I mu&s;t own I had &s;ome &s;ecret Satisfaction in viewing my native Country: and the next Day, early in the Morning, we embark'd, and reach'd the Town by Noon, ha|ving a very favourable Pa&s;&s;age. Here landing, I had like to have lo&s;t one of my <HI>Indians.</HI> Slinging his Hor&s;es into the Boat, he would get upon the Back of one of them, thinking he would go out quietly. But ju&s;t upon the In|&s;tant, a Ve&s;&s;el riding by the <HI>Peer</HI> fired a Gun, and frighted the Hor&s;e to &s;uch a degree, that he plung'd into the Sea, and &s;wam from the Shore; and the <HI>Indian</HI> being thrown off with the Start, had his Foot &s;o entangled in the Stirrup, that (notwith&s;tanding his Skill in Swimming) he mu&s;t have inevitably peri&s;h'd, if the other <HI>Indian,</HI> &s;ee|ing the Misfortune, had not plung'd in, and with a Knife cut the String. He then took the Hor&s;e by the Bridle with one Hand, and &s;wim|ming
<PB N="303" REF="312">
with the other, brought him &s;afe to Shore.</P>
<P><HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> not being over-pleas'd with ri|ding on Hor&s;e-back, we took the Flying-Coach the next Day, and &s;afely arriv'd at <HI>London.</HI> I order'd my <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Servant and the two <HI>In|dians,</HI> with our Baggage, to make two Days of it; and gave 'em Directions to wait at the Place where the Coach inn'd, till I &s;ent for 'em.</P>
<P>When we arriv'd at <HI>London,</HI> I did not care to go to any of my Acquaintance, but rather cho&s;e to lie at a <HI>Bagnio</HI> for a Day or two; but I &s;ent privately for my Uncle's Clerk, that had endeavour'd to prevent my being kidnapp'd by putting a Letter in my Pocket, mention'd in the Beginning of this Relation. He came to me according to my De&s;ire, but was over|joy'd and &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee me, though he hard|ly knew me at fir&s;t, for I had not &s;ent him my Name.</P>
<P>He inform'd me that my Uncle had been dead above a Year, and had left his E&s;tate to his elde&s;t Son&punc; and his Bu&s;ine&s;s to his younge&s;t and him: But they would often talk of me, not believing I was in the Land of the Living; yet they had increas'd my &s;mall E&s;tate with their utmo&s;t Care, intending, if ever I came back a|gain, to re&s;tore it to me. I let him into my whole Hi&s;tory, and he was very much pleas'd to hear that I had gain'd &s;uch a plentiful For|tune. I got him to provide us convenient Lodgings, and private, for I did not intend to go abroad much; and al&s;o to go to the Inn to fetch my Servants.</P>
<P>My two <HI>Indians</HI> &s;poke <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> very well, and I had learnt 'em to write and read; and being in modern Habits, they were not much gaz'd at.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="313">
The Time being expir'd that I was to look into my Commi&s;&s;ion, (as <HI>Donna I&s;abella</HI> call'd it) I re&s;olv'd to break it open, having &s;ome Curio&s;ity. But it was gone, and notwith&s;tand|ing all my Search, I could not gain any Ty|dings of it. I could not imagine how I &s;hould lo&s;e that, and nothing el&s;e. I mu&s;t own I was ve|ry unea&s;ie, fearing it might be &s;omething of Im|portance I was to do for <HI>Donna I&s;abella;</HI> therefore I di&s;patch'd a Letter to <HI>Italy,</HI> to tell 'em of my &s;afe Arrival, and my Lo&s;s of the Packet, (and to &s;end me a fre&s;h one) with Directions where to write to me.</P>
<P>While I &s;taid in Town, I purchas'd an E&s;tate of 2000<HI>l.</HI> a Year in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> and yet had 25000<HI>l.</HI> left, which I employ'd in the publick Funds. And now I had &s;ettled my E&s;tate, as well as that I had for <HI>Don Ferdinand,</HI> I was willing to forward him in his Studies, and pro|pos'd to &s;end him to <HI>Oxford</HI> with a Tutor. But he &s;till begg'd to &s;tay a little longer with me.</P>
<P>I therefore took a Re&s;olution of going to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> only with <HI>Don Ferdinand,</HI> and one Servant, with no other Bu&s;ine&s;s than to &s;ee the Place where my lo&s;t Trea&s;ure once liv'd.</P>
<P>When we were arriv'd, I enquir'd which was the Hou&s;e that Mr. <HI>Villars,</HI> late Merchant, for|merly dwelt in. We &s;oon found it out, but were inform'd one Capt. <HI>Kendrick</HI> dwelt there. I was inqui&s;itive to know if there was any Ty|dings of one <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> who was formerly Maid to Mrs. <HI>Villars,</HI> Daughter to the deceas'd Merchant; and at la&s;t got Information that &s;he liv'd at a Country Hou&s;e near the Sea-&s;ide.</P>
<P>I went immediately away for the Place, tho' near thirty Mile off, and late in the Evening&punc; Before we had rid far, the Skies became gloo|my,
<PB N="305" REF="314">
and a violent Storm threaten'd us, which &s;oon overtook us with &s;uch Fury, that we were forc'd to put into a little Hou&s;e out of the Road for Shelter. When we came within, we could not &s;ee any Body in't but a little Child, playing with &s;ome Toys it had before it; and all we could get out of it was, that <HI>Mamma</HI> would come by and by. It was as lovely a Child as ever I &s;aw, and we were &s;till admiring it, when a Man and Woman came in. They were much amaz'd to find us there; but I begg'd their Pardon, and told 'em the Storm drove us in to take Shelter.</P>
<P>The Man told us we were very welcome to &s;uch as his Hou&s;e afforded, but he fear'd we &s;hould find but poor Accommodation. In &s;hort, the Storm kept up in its full Force, and now it grew dark, and we were two Mile from any Inn; and to add to our Di&s;tre&s;s, we were Stran|gers to the Road. The Man &s;eeing us &s;o put to it, told us he had but two Beds, but we &s;hould be welcome to 'em, &s;uch as they were.</P>
<P>I told him I would gratifie him for his Trou|ble, and thereupon gave him a Guinea. He was very well pleas'd with my Pre&s;ent, and be|gan to &s;hew it in his Looks, as well as the Woman. I gave him another, to provide us &s;omething to eat, and to take care of the Hor|&s;es. He &s;aid he had but bad Stable-room, but if I pleas'd he would take my Servant, and all the Hor&s;es, (with one of his own to bring him back again) and leave 'em at an Inn in the neighbouring Village. I agreed to it; and while he was gone I ask'd the good Woman many Que&s;tions about the Child which we &s;aw there, and &s;oon &s;ound it was none of their own, but a Gentlewoman's, a Stranger to them, and one they had never &s;een but once. Why, &s;aid I,
<PB N="306" REF="315">
how are you paid for the keeping of it? She &s;eem'd amaz'd at my Que&s;tion, and was &s;ome time be|fore &s;he an&s;wer'd me; but at la&s;t &s;he &s;aid &s;he was always very well paid.</P>
<P>I finding &s;he did not much care for talking upon that Subject, chang'd the Di&s;cour&s;e. Soon after the Man came in, and we went to Sup|per. I would have had <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> to have lain with me; but the Man under&s;tanding we u&s;ually lay a&s;under, would give us both the Beds, and they would &s;it up. I ask'd them where the Child lay; and they told us in a Cra|dle. I began to be concerned for the Infant, though without giving any Rea&s;on. When we had &s;upp'd, we went to Bed, and had but lit|tle Re&s;t; and when we ro&s;e in the Morning, (it proving fair and plea&s;ant) we re&s;olved to walk to the Inn where our Hor&s;es were, with our Ho&s;t for our Guide. When we arriv'd, I di&s;|mi&s;s'd him with another Guinea; and would have got immediately on Hor&s;e-back, but <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> was &s;o very much di&s;order'd that he was not able to mount. I was very much con|cern'd for his Indi&s;po&s;ition, and begg'd he would repo&s;e him&s;elf there, while I pur&s;u'd my Jour|ney; with a Promi&s;e to return the next Day, or &s;end my Servant for him. He con&s;ented that it &s;hould be &s;o, and I &s;et forward.</P>
<P>Coming to a Place where &s;everal Roads met, I was confounded to know the right, and there|fore was &s;ome time at a Stand, not knowing which to take: But hearing &s;everal Voices in an adjacent Barn, I made up to it on Foot, giving my Hor&s;e to my Man. The nearer I approach'd, the more Noi&s;e they made; but I could not under&s;tand 'em. This awaken'd my Curio&s;ity, and I &s;tole &s;oftly to the Barn, where I could ob&s;erve through a Crevice (un&s;een) upwards
wards
<PB N="307" REF="316">
of twenty Gyp&s;ies, &s;itting in a Huddle, with a Child in the mid&s;t &s;tark naked, which they were rubbing over with Walnut-Shells; and e|very time it cry'd they &s;et up that confus'd Noi&s;e. But I was very much &s;urpriz'd to find in that Child the Features of that I had &s;een the Night before at my Country Landlord's. I beckon'd my Servant to come near with my Hor&s;es; be|ing arm'd, I made to the Barn Door, and forc'd it open. I ask'd 'em, in an imperious Manner, what they were doing with that Child; and further affirm'd they had &s;tole it from &s;uch a Place, giving them to under&s;tand I had People coming to apprehend 'em. Upon hearing this, they all took to their Heels; and &s;ome (I found) that had come there with Crutches, ran very nimbly away without 'em; but the Child was left be|hind. I now began to con&s;ider with my &s;elf what I had done; and that I had gotten a Child, but did not know what to do with it. They had rubb'd the poor thing all over with the green Walnut-Shells, that made it look like one of their Fraternity. By good Fortune they had left his Cloaths behind 'em, as al&s;o &s;ome Rags, which I &s;uppo&s;e were to be put on in|&s;tead of the others.</P>
<P>My man and I dre&s;s'd it as well as we could, and aukwardly enough; but when we had fini&s;h'd (notwith&s;tanding my Ha&s;te) I re&s;olv'd to go back again, and enquire into this Affair. When we came to the Inn, I gave the Infant to the Care of the Woman of the Hou&s;e till my Re|turn; and under&s;tanding <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> was gone to Re&s;t, I proceeded to my Ho&s;t's Hou&s;e with|out di&s;turbing him. When we arriv'd there, I met the Woman at the Door. Pray, (&s;aid I to her) good Woman, where's the Child that I &s;aw here la&s;t Night? Where's the Child? (re|turn'd
<PB N="308" REF="317">
the Woman &s;nappingly) why the Child's in his Cradle a&s;leep. Let me &s;ee it; &s;aid I. No, &s;aid &s;he, I won't di&s;turb it for you, nor no one el&s;e. I told her peremptorily I would &s;ee it that In&s;tant, in &s;pight of her, for I fear'd &s;ome foul Play. She &s;eeing me re&s;olute, and lighting from my Hor&s;e; Well Sir, &s;eeing you are &s;o de&s;irous (&s;aid &s;he) I'll go and bring it to you. When &s;he was gone, I began to imagine my &s;elf mi|&s;taken, and that Children might be very like, without being the &s;ame; but I knew a Guinea would &s;oon reconcile her to my Rudene&s;s. I &s;taid waiting a con&s;iderable time, taken up with &s;everal Thoughts; and not ob&s;erving how long I had waited, till my Man told me the old Wo|man was long a coming. I began to call, and no body an&s;wering, I order'd him to go in, and &s;ee for her. He came out again, and told me &s;he was not in the Hou&s;e, nor any one el&s;e; but that he believ'd &s;he had &s;lip'd out of the back Door, and got away through the Garden. I began to think there was &s;omething very extraordinary in the Adventure of the Child, and re&s;olv'd to be &s;trict in the Examination. I enter'd the Hou&s;e my &s;elf, and &s;earch'd, but to no Purpo&s;e. I &s;ent my Man in the mean time in pur&s;uit of the Wo|man. But he return'd without her. There was never a Neighbouring-hou&s;e to enquire, no near|er than the Village where I had left the Child. So I had ju&s;t got on Hor&s;eback in order to go back, when I perceiv'd the Man coming to|wards his own Hou&s;e. I &s;pur'd on to meet him, and he &s;eem'd much concern'd; I &s;eiz'd him by the Collar, and told him, I came to &s;ecure him, for the Murder of the Child I &s;aw at his Hou&s;e la&s;t Night. The Man was in &s;uch a terrible Fright at what I &s;aid, that he was more dead than alive&punc; Sure Sir, &s;aid he, it can't be, it is not
<PB N="309" REF="318">
murder'd. I bid him produce it, or he &s;hould be try'd for it. In &s;hort, I frighted the poor Fellow &s;o much, that he told me, if I would have a little Patience, he would tell me all that he knew concerning it (&s;till crying, I hope it is not murder'd.) I told him the Child was &s;afe. We went back to his Hou&s;e, where after the Fellow had a little compos'd him&s;elf, he made me the following Relation.</P>
<P>About three Years ago, a Gentlewoman came to my Wife, and made a Bargain with her to keep this Infant, and by paying us hand&s;omely, we imagin'd it belong'd to &s;ome Per&s;on of Di|&s;tinction; for we receiv'd ten Pounds every Quar|ter, and that before it was due. The Lady would often take the Child for a Day or two, and return it again. My Wife, being a worldly Woman, laid &s;everal Plots how to know the truth of the Child, but to no Purpo&s;e; but by all Circum&s;tances we believ'd the Parents did not care for owning it. One Day my Wife told me &s;he had a De&s;ign in her Head, but &s;he would not di&s;clo&s;e it, till &s;he could be &s;ure of &s;ucceeding; and when the Lady came the next time to take the Child away for a Day as u&s;ual, my Wife was in Conference with her for &s;ome time. And when &s;he was gone, &s;he told me that &s;he had prevail'd upon the Lady to pay her one hundred Pounds before hand, and that &s;he brought her to it, by telling her we &s;hould make a Purcha&s;e of the Hou&s;e we live in. In &s;hort, my Wife (who wears the Breeches) made me con&s;ent to carry on the Deceit; and the next Day the Lady brought the Child, and the hundred Pound and gave it my Wife, without any thing under my Hand, and left us in a &s;mall time after. When &s;he was gone, my Wife di&s;cours'd me after this man|ner.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="319">
Husband, we have now one hundred and fifty Pounds (for we had been very &s;aving) be&s;ides our Goods, and Cattle, which will fetch us one hundred more. With this Money we may go into my Country (which was the <HI>I&s;le of Man)</HI> and live contentedly all our Lives, without any fears of bad Crops, and ill Markets. Well, but &s;aid I, what will become of the Child. I quickly found by her Expre&s;&s;ions that &s;he re&s;olv'd to murder it. I was &s;truck with Horror at her Pro|po&s;ition, and notwith&s;tanding her violent Tem|per, oppos'd her in't; and told her, upon no Conditions would I con&s;ent to do &s;o barbarous a Deed. I found her &s;o fix'd upon the de&s;ign of Murder, that I was at la&s;t, as the lighte&s;t Evil, obliged to con&s;ent to her &s;elling it to a Compa|ny of <HI>Gyp&s;ies;</HI> but with the greate&s;t Reluctance in the World; which was executed this Morn|ing. But we had di&s;pos'd of every thing before hand, with Intention to have gone for <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> two Days hence; for we were a&s;&s;ur'd the Lady would not come again for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>When he had done, I inform'd him how I came to meet with the Child. I then began to examine if he did not know where the Lady liv'd; and at la&s;t he confe&s;s'd he dogg'd her to her Hou&s;e one Day, &s;et on by his Wife, but would never di&s;cover it to her, for fear of her playing &s;ome Trick. I prevail'd with him to go with me, and &s;hew me the Hou&s;e, with the promi&s;e of a Reward, and letting him go after|wards. We &s;et out (after he had got a Hor&s;e) and in two Hours arriv'd at a plea&s;ant Hou&s;e, &s;urrounded by a &s;mall River, and almo&s;t cover'd with Trees. I &s;topp'd &s;ome time to view it, and through a little Avenue &s;aw two Women gather|ing Flowers; one had her Face turn'd towards us, which the Man &s;aid was the Woman that
<PB N="311" REF="320">
us'd to come to &s;ee the Child, and that was the Place &s;he carry'd it to. I order'd my Man to take the Hor&s;es to the next Town, about half a Mile off, and come to me again. But I needed not have bid mine Ho&s;t to have gone about his Bu&s;ine&s;s; for he being fearful of the Event, got away without our perceiving it.</P>
<P>When my Man was gone, I walk'd about to view the Hou&s;e, but I had lo&s;t &s;ight of the Wo|men, and it began to rain again. I &s;tood up for Shelter from the Weather under a large Oak; and had but ju&s;t got there, when a Woman came out of the Gate, with her Mi&s;tre&s;s's Service, to invite me in. I was very well pleas'd with the Invitation, and went into the Hou&s;e, where I was met by the Gentlewoman, a very hand&s;ome Lady. She told me, as I look'd like a Gentle|man, &s;he de&s;ir'd I would take Shelter there till the Storm was over. I return'd her the Thanks her Civility de&s;erv'd, and we &s;at down, but were immediately interrupted with ringing at the Gate; and I perceiv'd, through a &s;mall Window, a Gentleman in a Scarlet-cloak a-light from his Hor&s;e, and go in quite through the Hou&s;e. The Lady begg'd my Pardon, and told me, &s;he was obliged to go keep another Lady Company while that Per&s;on was there, but would wait on me a&s;|&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible again. As my Curio&s;ity had brought me there, I had no Thoughts of going away till I had &s;atisfy'd it in &s;ome mea&s;ure. I could hear the Man's Voice very plain, who &s;eem'd to threaten a Lady with a great many Hard&s;hips as to her Fortune, if &s;he would not con&s;ent to his Love. The Lady an&s;wer'd in &s;o low a Voice, that I could not hear what &s;he &s;aid, but I found her An&s;wers did but inrage him the more. They talk'd a great while, and at la&s;t they &s;eem'd to be &s;ilent. I hearing the Door o|pen,
<PB N="312" REF="321">
&s;tep'd back into the Room where the Lady left me. She came to me again, and &s;at down. I hope, Sir, (&s;aid &s;he) you'll pardon my Rude|ne&s;s, but I could not wait on you before. Ma|dam, (return'd I) I ought to beg your Pardon for taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your Hou&s;e here, who am an utter Stranger to you. We were interrupted in our Compliments, by the Voice of a Per&s;on that &s;cream'd out Murder! Murder!&mdash;We both ran out, and &s;he coming to the Door where the Noi&s;e was, we found it &s;hut, and the Voice &s;till calling out for Help. I bur&s;t it open with my Foot, and, with my Sword in my Hand, ran into the Room, where I found the Gentleman that came in the Cloak, endeavouring to force a Lady. I gave him a Stroke upon the Head, and bid him turn about and defend him&s;elf; which he did, with many bitter Exclamations. But after &s;everal Pa&s;|&s;es, I had the good Fortune to di&s;arm him; and he having receiv'd &s;everal Wounds, drop'd down with lo&s;s of Blood. The Lady he had attempt|ed, was &s;till in a Swoon; and the Bu&s;tle had brought &s;everal Women Servants into the Room. I retir'd into the Chamber I came from, but de|&s;ir'd the Lady to take &s;ome care of the Wretch, who de&s;erv'd Death; but I wi&s;h'd might &s;ur|vive, to prevent farther Trouble. She took my Advice, and &s;ent to the next Town for a Surgeon, who &s;oon came, and my Man along with him by Accident. Perceiving his Wounds were not dangerous, (for I &s;tood by while the Surgeon dre&s;s'd him) and finding the Hou&s;e in too much Confu&s;ion to be better inform'd concern|ing the Child, I was about to take my Leave. But the Lady I had &s;o timely re&s;cu'd, having re|cover'd her Fright, de&s;ir'd &s;he might thank me for &s;o great a Providence. I was ea&s;ily per&s;uad|ed to &s;tay, and immediately a Lady came into the
<PB N="313" REF="322">
Room. But, good God! what Tran&s;ports did I feel, when in that Lady, I beheld every Feature of my dear Mrs. <HI>Villars.</HI> Our Eyes were fix'd up|on each other, and the Sight of me rais'd &s;uch a tumult of Joy in her Brea&s;t, that combating with her un&s;ettled Heart, &s;he fell down in a Swoon again. The other Lady at fir&s;t knew not the Meaning of our Di&s;order: But when I call'd her my dear Wife, and other extravagant Ex|pre&s;&s;ions of my Love, &s;he &s;oon gue&s;s'd the Truth, and &s;eem'd as much tran&s;ported as we were. Words would but wrong the Sentiments we felt for each other. Therefore, let the Reader (if po&s;&s;ible) gue&s;s the Joy of two Lovers meeting, after imagining each other no longer in this World. We thought it was all a Dream; but at la&s;t being convinc'd of the Reality, we &s;ent privately for the Par&s;on, and were ty'd by the outward Ceremony of the Church, who&s;e Hearts had been divinely united long before; and that Night I took once more Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what I valu'd above all the World could give.</P>
<P>The next Day, I &s;ent for <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> to partake in our Joy, but was inform'd his Indi&s;|po&s;ition had increas'd upon him &s;o much, that it was dangerous to remove him. This was &s;ome allay to my Joy, for I had a real Friend&s;hip for him. I told my dear Wife, the Obligation I had to his Father. I now de&s;ir'd to know the Particulars of her wonderful E&s;cape, which &s;he related to me after the following manner.</P>
<P>You know, &s;aid &s;he, when we parted at <HI>Me|quinez,</HI> our Hearts foreboded &s;omething would follow prejudicial to our Loves. I was not ac|quainted with <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI>'s E&s;cape; if I had, it is very probable I might have avoided the Misfor|tune that befell me: But he got a Ve&s;&s;el to car|ry him to <HI>Sallee,</HI> (as he inform'd me, when I was
<PB N="314" REF="323">
their Pri&s;oner again) and by the Way, met with his Ma&s;ter <HI>Hamet;</HI> who wrote a Letter to the Governor of <HI>Mammora,</HI> and &s;ent <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> with it, while he intended to wait near the Coa&s;t to guard us back. When they had &s;eiz'd me, they hurry'd me away immediately on board a Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;ail'd upon the In&s;tant; and before Night met with <HI>Hamet,</HI> where I was carry'd on Board. He upbraided me in Terms, that gave me to ex|pect wor&s;e Treatment from him; but I told him, rather than &s;ubmit to his nau&s;eous Love, I would &s;tarve my &s;elf to Death, if I could find no other means to rid me of Life. The next Day a Storm ari&s;ing of a &s;udden, blew down one of their Ma&s;ts, and drove 'em back again, with|in Sight of the Port of <HI>Mammora;</HI> but to avoid it, they ran beyond it, and the Storm continu'd. In the Evening it began to abate, and he &s;teer'd his Cour&s;e back again; but before it was dark a Ship appear'd in View. And notwith&s;tanding he had lo&s;t &s;everal Men in a former Engagement, he re&s;olv'd to &s;et upon this Ve&s;&s;el; and it grow|ing Calm he got up to her with rowing. The other Ve&s;&s;el knowing what &s;he was, began with us fir&s;t, and fir'd very briskly.</P>
<P>The Fight continu'd about an Hour, as near as I could gue&s;s; for all my Employment was to pray, that &s;ome lucky Shot would end that Life, which was &s;o burthen&s;ome to me. When the Noi&s;e of the Ordnance ceas'd, I had not Curio&s;ity enough to go to &s;ee how Affairs &s;tood. But judge my Surprize and Plea&s;ure, when I tell you the fir&s;t Man that enter'd the Cabin, was the Mate that I had made Captain, as I mention'd to you in the Relation of my fir&s;t Misfortune.</P>
<P>How Madam! cry'd he, is it you! thank Heav'n my Voyage is at End. Come Madam, (continu'd he) I'll carry you to one that thinks
<PB N="315" REF="324">
her Life a Burden till you are &s;afe, being your Danger is owing to her. I had not Power to return him an An&s;wer, or ask him who it was he meant, I was &s;o confounded with Thought. He carry'd me on board of his own Ship, where he brought Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an</HI> to me. My Heart was &s;o full of Content, that for a Moment you had &s;lipt out of my Memory.</P>
<P>The Ship of <HI>Hamet</HI>'s was ju&s;t &s;inking, for they had &s;hot her between Wind and Water, and could not come to &s;top it. They had taken out as many of their Goods as the time would per|mit, and all the Men that were wounded (before &s;he Sunk). I let 'em into your Story, and the mutual Affection we had; and in Return the Captain gave me the following Account of their getting away from <HI>Sallee.</HI></P>
<P>You know, Madam, (&s;aid he) the <HI>Moors</HI> were not very &s;trict in &s;earching us; and I had at the fir&s;t Sight of 'em (judging what they were) &s;e|cur'd all the Merchants Money de&s;ign'd for Trade, as well as what I had of my own about my Cloaths, and in a great Fur Cap, which I wore upon my Head.</P>
<P><HI>Hamet</HI> being &s;atisfy'd with you, and what he found be&s;ides, would not &s;ell us for Slaves, but gave us the Liberty of walking about the Town, with a &s;mall Allowance of Provi&s;ion, till we could &s;end a Per&s;on to <HI>England</HI> for a thou&s;and Pounds, which was the Ran&s;om of both Ship and Men. In a little time, I became acquainted with one of the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Sallee,</HI> whom I prevail'd upon by the force of Money to buy the Ship, and pay for our Ran&s;om; which he did, without any one's concerning them&s;elves about it. We did all we could to find you out, but to no purpo&s;e; &s;o we were obliged to &s;et Sail for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="325">
In our Voyage home, Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an</HI> inform'd we with your Story, not concealing even her own Part in't; and I found her &s;o &s;incere in her Repentance, that I could not help pitying her, which &s;oon ro&s;e a &s;ofter Pa&s;&s;ion; and a&s;&s;oon as we arriv'd in <HI>England,</HI> the Ceremony of the Church compleated my Happine&s;s. We acquaint|ed Mr. <HI>Kendrick,</HI> your Lady&s;hip's Guardian and Steward, with your Misfortune; who, with the Advice of us, fitted the Ship out in your Name, with a &s;ufficient Quantity of Money for your Ran&s;om, if it were po&s;&s;ible for us to hear of you; and by meeting with you now, we have com|pa&s;s'd what we intended. I return'd 'em many Thanks, (e&s;pecially Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> who would ac|company her Husband, in hopes to meet with me.) I de&s;ir'd Captain <HI>Morrice,</HI> (which is the Name of Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an</HI>'s Husband) to &s;teer towards <HI>Mammora,</HI> but he told me it was not &s;afe: For as there was a War proclaim'd between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> the Amba&s;&s;ador could not an&s;wer it if he did not make us Prize; and we were further inform'd by one of the <HI>Renegado</HI> Pri&s;o|ners, that he was very well a&s;&s;ur'd they were &s;ail'd for <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Notice we directed our Cour&s;e, with this Hope, that you would &s;oon arrive in <HI>England,</HI> and find me out; for I remember'd in the Story of my Misfortunes, I gave you Marks enough to let you know where I was to be found. Before we made the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t, I found my &s;elf with Child, and the very Imagination had like to have co&s;t me my Life, for fear the Father of the unborn Infant would not come time e|nough to &s;ave my Credit; for though I was well a&s;&s;ur'd of your Honour, yet I knew the cen&s;uring World would be apt to blame my Conduct. I
<PB N="317" REF="326">
could hide nothing from the faithful <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> who join'd her Fears with mine.</P>
<P>When we came into <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Channel, I con|&s;ulted with <HI>Su&s;an</HI> about my Management, and I at la&s;t re&s;olv'd to live Private, till I could hear &s;ome News of you. But I was obliged to let Mr. <HI>Kenderick</HI> my Steward into the Knowledge of my Arrival, tho' he was a Stranger to my Condition.</P>
<P>I &s;ent to <HI>London,</HI> in hopes of hearing &s;ome News of you; but having kept the Name of your Uncle a Secret in your Relation, our En|deavours prov'd fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>My Melancholy encreas'd with my Condition; and for fear of a Di&s;covery, I went into <HI>Wales,</HI> with a Relation of Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an</HI>'s, and was de|liver'd of a Boy, that prov'd the greate&s;t Com|fort to my &s;inking Heart; for in his Face was every Feature of his dear Father. I brought him back again here, and had him put to Nur&s;e, as a Child to a Relation of Mrs. <HI>Su&s;an</HI>'s, and had re&s;olv'd but this very Day to have &s;ent for him home, that I might always have the Satisfaction of having him in my Sight.</P>
<P>My Steward, finding I was under a Nece&s;&s;ity of living Private, began to talk to me of Love; and often proceeded &s;o far (after finding I di&s;|dain'd his Pa&s;&s;ion) to tell me, if I would not con&s;ent to make him my Husband, he would take care my E&s;tate &s;hould come into his Hands. Though I could have &s;oon broke his De&s;igns as to my Fortune, yet my &s;olitary Dwelling pleas'd me &s;o well, that I gave him good Words, which did but more encourage his In&s;olence, till it ar|riv'd to that Pitch you &s;o happily deliver'd me from.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="327">
I &s;oon found, by my Wife's Relation, that the Infant I had &s;o marvellou&s;ly &s;av'd, was our own Child. When I related the Accident of meeting with the Child, my Wife expre&s;s'd &s;o much Feat&punc; Terror, Tenderne&s;s and Joy, that I thought the different Pa&s;&s;ions would have taken away her Un|der&s;tanding. By this we may learn, there is a ruling Providence that regulates every Action of our Lives, when they tend to Virtue.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Kendrick,</HI> (the Per&s;on that made the At|tempt upon my Wife) was &s;oon inform'd of our happy Meeting; and his Wounds mending e|very Day, he begg'd we would favour him with a Vi&s;it, (which we comply'd with) where he ask'd Pardon for all pa&s;t Offences in &s;uch a &s;in|cere Manner, that we were ea&s;ily prevail'd upon to forgive him.</P>
<P>He &s;ent for all the Books of Accounts and Writings, that belong'd to my Wife's E&s;tate, and deliver'd 'em up to us.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day Captain <HI>Morrice</HI> arriv'd from <HI>France;</HI> where he went by the De&s;ire of my Wife, as her la&s;t Hope, to know if he could gain any Intelligence of me.

I now began to think of <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI>'s Illne&s;s, and re&s;olv'd to go with my Wife to make him a Vi&s;it; and my dear Wife was &s;o impatient to embrace the Child, &s;he would not let me &s;tay to fini&s;h my Affairs with Mr. <HI>Kendrick.</HI></P>
<P>As we were upon our Journey, we were met by a Relation of mine, Son to that barbarous

Uncle that had Kidnap'd me. He was in the Country when I arriv'd at <HI>London.</HI> Notwith|&s;tanding the Injury I had &s;uffer'd from his Fa|ther, I could not help receiving him with the utmo&s;t Affection; for we were both of an Age, and very like as to our Per&s;ons, being brought up together till the Death of my Father, which created a Friend&s;hip for each other.</P>
<P>He brought me a Packet from <HI>Italy,</HI> and in it one inclos'd from <HI>Don Jaques,</HI> &s;ent from St. <HI>Sal|valdor.</HI> I broke open that fir&s;t, which was as follows.</P>

What Words can expre&s;s the Amazement I felt, at the reading this la&s;t Letter! My Thoughts were confounded in Thought, and a Chaos of Ideas po&s;&s;e&s;s'd my Brain. I was in &s;o much Confu&s;ion, that I thought of returning home again, to con&s;ider of this &s;trange Turn. Recol|lected Circum&s;tances convinc'd me, how blind I was in not di&s;covering it &s;ooner. My Soul was immediately fill'd with the mo&s;t tender Pity; and I had not the u&s;e of Words to declare my Sentiments to my Wife and Cou&s;in. Sometimes I would imagine it was all a fictitious Dream; yet at la&s;t I was not di&s;pleas'd, that I had it in my Power to re&s;tore to <HI>Don Jaques</HI> his long lo&s;t Daughter. My Wife was as much concern'd as I was, and my Cou&s;in could hardly believe it. I &s;oon found that &s;he had taken care the Packet &s;hould not fall into my Hands; and that con|vinc'd me &s;he would not have her Di&s;gui&s;e di&s;|cover'd. The next Day we re&s;olv'd to vi&s;it her, and form my Re&s;olution from my Ob&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>When we arriv'd at the Inn, we found her dre&s;s'd at a Table, with Paper, Pens and Ink be|fore her, but very weak. I pre&s;ented my Wife and Cou&s;in to her. She &s;aluted 'em, and &s;eem'd mightily pleas'd with my good Fortune, and was very much concern'd her Indi&s;po&s;ition would not admit her waiting on me, to partake in my Con|tentment. Her Weakne&s;s was &s;o prevalent, that &s;he could hardly utter her Words. She knew nothing of receiving the Packet from my Cou&s;in, but after we had &s;at &s;ome time, I gave her the Letter from her Father; which, a&s;&s;oon as &s;he had read, &s;he fell backward upon the Bed in a Swoon.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="332">
The Noi&s;e we made at this Accident brought &s;everal People into the Room; and among the re&s;t my Landlady, who it &s;eems had fell de&s;pe|rately in Love with her, as imagining her to be a Man. She made &s;uch aukward Complainings, that, if our Minds had been at ea&s;e, would have produc'd much Mirth; but among her Actions, &s;he unbutton'd her Cloaths, to give her Breath, and &s;oon di&s;cover'd her Mi&s;take in the Object of her Wi&s;hes. When &s;he found by her Brea&s;ts that &s;he was a Woman, &s;he ran down Stairs with the utmo&s;t Precipitation, and left us alone to recover her. When we had brought her to her Sen&s;es again, &s;he &s;oon found that we had di&s;cover'd her Sex; and the Grief and Shame at the Accident had like to have thrown her again into her Swooning. It was &s;ome time before we could bring her to her &s;elf: But, &s;he found by my Di&s;cour&s;e, that I under&s;tood the whole Secret.</P>
<P>After a long Pau&s;e, &s;aid &s;he, I did not intend to let my Frailty be known to you till after my Death; but &s;ince it is di&s;cover'd, I beg you will have &s;ome Regard to my Memory, and I &s;hall die contented. I begg'd her not to talk of Death, but live to comfort her griev'd Parents. It is too late, &s;aid &s;he, to talk of any Comfort, for I have call'd my greate&s;t Friend Death to my Aid, who is ju&s;t now arriv'd. Upon uttering the&s;e Words, a deadly Palene&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;s'd her Face, and Trem|bling &s;eiz'd her Limbs: She had ju&s;t Strength enough to declare to us that &s;he had taken a Do&s;e of Poi&s;on, provided for the Occa&s;ion, bought of an Apothecary of the Town; and that &s;he was ju&s;t going to write a Letter to me, but was pre|vented by our &s;udden Appearance, who&s;e Con|tents were only to &s;ee her &s;ecretly bury'd, and if po&s;&s;ible to have conceal'd her Sex and Story from the World. She had hardly made an End, before
<PB N="324" REF="333">
her Speech for&s;ook her, and Life in all Appear|ance fled the beauteous Dwelling. My Wife was not pre&s;ent at this Accident, being her eager De&s;ire had carry'd her to her Child; but &s;he came in before it was over. My Cou&s;in &s;eem'd more oppre&s;s'd with Grief than any of us, for Love had taken full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;on of his Heart.</P>
<P>While Sorrow had lock'd up all our Tongues, the Apothecary came in, in a &s;trange Confu&s;ion; for the Report had &s;oon di&s;pers'd it &s;elf all over that little Village. Sir, &s;aid he to me, don't be concern'd at the Condition you &s;ee the Gentle|man in, for he is not dead, he has only took a &s;leeping Potion. I partly gue&s;s'd his De&s;ign, when he apply'd to me for Poi&s;on; and the ex|traordinary Price he paid for it, convinc'd me it was for &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter De&s;ign; and therefore I happily impos'd upon him.</P>
<P>This News reviv'd us all again, e&s;pecially my Cou&s;in, who I thought would have gone di|&s;tracted for Joy; and to &s;ee his impatient watch|ing for her Life's return, (if we may call it &s;o) only gave me further Proof, that one Look is &s;uf|ficient to fix Love for ever in the Soul. The Apothecary, during this interval of Life and Death, pour'd Cordials into her Mouth to help the Operation; and at la&s;t &s;he open'd her un|willing Eyes, and gaz'd around her, as if &s;he had been in another World: But we &s;oon convinc'd her of the Apothecary's Deceit, at which &s;he &s;eem'd in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion, and gave us to under&s;tand that Life was forc'd upon her again&s;t her Inclination, and &s;he would &s;hake it off.</P>
<P>We gave her all the Comfort we were capable of; and my Wife told her if &s;he talk'd any lon|ger of Death, it was only that &s;he could not bear to &s;ee us happy. This as it were rous'd her from her Lethargy. Well then, &s;aid &s;he, I will
<PB N="325" REF="334">
live, if it be only to convince you, that I am pleas'd to &s;ee my Captain ble&s;s'd (for &s;he would always call me &s;o.) After we had a little compos'd her, we left her with my Cou&s;in, to look after our Child, who was in the &s;ame Place; which had prov'd the &s;ecret In&s;tinct of Nature; for at the fir&s;t Sight in the Hou&s;e of his unnatural Nur&s;e, I could not help feeling a tender Regard for him. When we had &s;atisfy'd our Inn, we prevail'd upon <HI>Donna Bianca</HI> (now no longer <HI>Fer|dinand)</HI> to come into the Coach with us, and we arriv'd that Evening at <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> where we took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e (which Captain <HI>Kendrick</HI> had liv'd in) that belong'd to my Wife. We &s;taid &s;ome time there to &s;ettle my Wife's Affairs, and as much to recover <HI>Donna Bianca</HI>'s Indi&s;po|&s;ition.</P>
<P>My Cou&s;in by his A&s;&s;iduity gain'd very much of her E&s;teem, but &s;he freely declar'd &s;he had no Room in her Heart for Love: But notwith|&s;tanding, with much Importunity, we prevail'd upon her to accept him for a Husband; and her E&s;teem &s;oon came up to a more tender Pa&s;&s;ion. A&s;&s;oon as the Ceremony was over, we took a Journey to <HI>London</HI> to &s;ettle our Affairs there, and provide for my expected Gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>One Morning as we were pur&s;uing our Jour|ney, coming near the Skirts of a Wood, we heard &s;everal Groans, which alarm'd us; but as we had too many People about us arm'd, to &s;ear any thing, we came out of the Coach to know the Rea&s;on: Where we found a Woman wel|tring in Blood, being &s;tabb'd in &s;everal Places with a Sword. When I came to take a near|er View, I found it was my former Ma&s;ter (the Watch-maker's) Wife. I could not help having Compa&s;&s;ion for any Per&s;on in that Con|dition, therefore order'd her to be taken up and
<PB N="326" REF="335">
put in the Coach. <HI>Donna Bianca</HI> open'd her Brea&s;t, and &s;topp'd her Wounds as well as &s;he could, till we could get a Surgeon that I had order'd to be &s;ent for. She &s;oon knew me, and cry'd out, Sure Heaven has &s;ent you that know my Guilt to be Witne&s;s of my Repen|tance: The Wrongs I have done my Husband have pur&s;u'd me to my Grave. When I had robb'd him of all I could lay my Hands on, I made my E&s;cape to <HI>Ireland,</HI> chang'd my Name, and &s;et up for a greater Fortune than I really was. I had many Suitors, but Heaven, to pu|ni&s;h me, made me place my Affections on a Per|&s;on that courted me for my Money: And tho' I &s;oon under&s;tood he had but very little E&s;tate, yet Love prevail'd with me to make him my Husband. He &s;oon &s;pent both his own and my Fortune, and by contracting many Debts was forc'd to fly for <HI>England;</HI> and finding no Re|lief, took to the Highway, where he has com|mitted many Robberies. He lodg'd me in a neighbouring Village; but our Place of Meeting was generally in this Wood, for fear of a Di&s;|covery. This Morning he came, according to Appointment, where he began his Di&s;cour&s;e af|ter this Manner. I had no Inclination for you when I fir&s;t marry'd you, but now I utterly ab|hor you, therefore am re&s;olv'd to part with you: But I have another Rea&s;on be&s;ides my Hatred to you, which is this; I have it in my Power to marry an old Woman, very rich; and there|fore it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end you out of the World, for fear our Marriage &s;hould come to her Ears, and &s;poil my Fortune. He follow'd his Di&s;|cour&s;e with the&s;e Wounds, which he gave me, and rode into the Wood, without my once of|fering to open my Mouth; for A&s;toni&s;hment had ty'd up my Tongue. I told her, I hop'd
<PB N="327" REF="336">
Heaven had given her all its Puni&s;hment in this World. That's all the Hope I have, &s;aid &s;he, and in my unfeigned Repentance; for I feel Death approaching. We ob&s;erv'd &s;he was ju&s;t expiring; and before the Surgeon came, &s;he gave up her la&s;t Breath, calling upon Heaven for Mer|cy. I gave Orders for her Funeral, and &s;ent af|ter her Murderer, but to no Purpo&s;e. But I heard he was taken for the High-way, &s;ome time after, and executed at <HI>Worce&s;ter;</HI> where he con|fe&s;s'd the Murder of his Wife. Thus we &s;ee the Hand of Heaven, though &s;low in Pu|ni&s;hments, yet always overtakes the Guilty. When I had given Directions for her Funeral, we pur&s;u'd our Journey, and arriv'd &s;afe at <HI>Lon|don.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Don Antonio</HI> and his Lady arriv'd fir&s;t, in a private Capacity; not caring to make a Show according to their Birth, to be taken Notice of. And in a few Days after came <HI>Don Jaques</HI> and his Lady, in a Ship of their own, in Compa|ny with the <HI>I&s;abella</HI> which my Lieutenant com|manded, that had &s;prung a Leak which oblig'd her to put into <HI>Lisbon</HI> to refit, where <HI>Don Ja|ques</HI> joyfully met with her.</P>
<P>I had de&s;ir'd <HI>Donna Bianca</HI> once more to put on her Boy's Cloaths; for I intended agreeably to &s;urprize her Parents.</P>
<P>I was oblig'd to take Lodgings for <HI>Don Ja|ques</HI>'s Family, being they intended to take a convenient Hou&s;e in the City. A&s;&s;oon as mutu|al Care&s;&s;es were over, Grief again took Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their Souls for the Lo&s;s of their Child. After condoling with 'em &s;ome time, I begg'd 'em to hope for the be&s;t, and that it was po&s;&s;i|ble to hear of her again. They &s;hook their Heads, and told me that Thought was long gi|ven
<PB N="328" REF="337">
over, and they had no Hope but in Time to wear away their unhappy Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>I told 'em I had a Kin&s;man, as much as I could remember the Features of their beautiful Daughter, as like her as a Man could be like a Woman. They expre&s;s'd a great De&s;ire to &s;ee him. I told 'em I had invited him with ano|ther Relation to &s;up with us on purpo&s;e. We had taken care before, that <HI>Donna Bianca</HI> &s;hould Ombre her Face, and &s;peak nothing but <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> on purpo&s;e to carry on the Deceit. 'Till the time of their coming, we &s;pent in relating our Accidents in the Voyage. I told 'em how much I was &s;urpriz'd at the Likene&s;s of my Cou&s;in to their Daughter: for I had given 'em to un|der&s;tand it was a Relation I had never &s;een be|fore I left <HI>England:</HI> which was Truth.</P>
<P>When the Time I had appointed came, <HI>Don|na Bianca</HI> and my Cou&s;in enter'd. I pre&s;ented 'em to <HI>Don Jaques</HI> and his Wife, as my Rela|tions, and they &s;aluted 'em as utter Strangers. But when they &s;aw and heard <HI>Donna Bianca,</HI> they bur&s;t into Tears at the great Re&s;emblance in both Voice and Features, as they &s;aid, to their Daughter. She carry'd it on as long as &s;he could, &s;peaking <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> all the while; but at la&s;t their Tears prevail'd &s;o much upon her Tender|ne&s;s, that &s;he begg'd leave to retire, but would return immediately. I made an Apology for my Kin&s;man to <HI>Don Jaques</HI> and his Wife, and told 'em he would return in a very little time. The Space of their Ab&s;ence was fill'd with Sighs and Tears; and as I knew their Grief would &s;oon be over, I never attempted to comfort 'em.</P>
<P>When they were ready, they &s;ent a Servant to tell me a Gentleman wanted to &s;peak with
<PB N="329" REF="338">
me. I retir'd, and came in again immediately, and told 'em our Company would be encreas'd, for another Relation and his Wife were ju&s;t coming in to &s;up with us; and upon the In|&s;tant my Cou&s;in enter'd, leading by the Hand <HI>Donna Bianca.</HI> They both ran and kneel'd down before <HI>Don Jaques</HI> and his Wife. At the Sight of their Daughter, the Mother fell backward in the Chair in a Swoon; and <HI>Don Jaques</HI> was in &s;uch a Surprize that he could not open his Mouth, but expre&s;s'd his Joy by Tears, Ki&s;&s;es, and Embraces; and his Lady coming to her &s;elf, had like to have &s;tifled her with her Tran&s;|ports.</P>
<P>They did not ask any rea&s;onable Que&s;tions till the Torrent of their Joy was poured out. After the fir&s;t Tran&s;ports were over, <HI>Donna Bi|anca</HI> told her own Story. She &s;aid, the fir&s;t time I din'd at their Hou&s;e in St. <HI>Salvador,</HI> Love flew into her Heart; and knowing the Mode&s;ty due to her Sex, &s;he was re&s;olv'd never to di&s;cover it till &s;he found the State of mine: Yet finding her Pa&s;&s;ion daily increa&s;e, and under&s;tand|ing the Day of my Departure, &s;he procured &s;e|cretly the Habit of a Man, with all other Ne|ce&s;&s;aries, and convey'd her&s;elf on Board in the Boat that carry'd the Pre&s;ents her Father had &s;ent me; and counterfeited the Letter &s;he gave me as from her Father. Every thing an&s;wered my Wi&s;h, &s;aid &s;he; but I &s;oon found my Cap|tain had no Heart to be&s;tow. It is needle&s;s to tell how many bitter Sighs and Tears that Knowledge co&s;t me: But it is now buried in Oblivion. Then &s;he proceeded to beg their Pardon for her ra&s;h Folly, as &s;he call'd it; and they were too much overjoy'd not to forgive her every thing; and they expre&s;t a great deal
<PB N="330" REF="339">
of Satisfaction in that they could now call me their Relation. We liv'd in all the Content|ment imaginable, returning Heaven our grate|ful Thanks for its bounteous Mercy. And now I am &s;ettled, I'll take Leave of my Reader with this Couplet of the Poet:
<Q><L>O never let a virtuous Mind de&s;pair,</L>

<HEAD>THE VOYAGE, &amp;c. OF <HI>Richard Ca&s;telman,</HI> Gent.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Dangers at Sea are certainly more imminent than tho&s;e on Shore; even in the faire&s;t Weather, the Space is very &s;mall betwen this World and the next.</P>
<P>A <HI>Grecian</HI> Philo&s;opher was, in my Opinion, much in the right, when ask'd by a Friend if he would go to a neighbouring I&s;land in the <HI>Hel|le&s;pont</HI> to hunt, an&s;wer'd, if he &s;hould be guilty of &s;o much Folly, he &s;hould have no other Hope but of returning &s;afe back, for tho&s;e that tru&s;ted their Lives to the Sea ventur'd with a changing Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I embark'd on Board Captain <HI>Cox,</HI> bound for <HI>Charles-town</HI> in <HI>Carolina,</HI> with Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> and his Family, and arriv'd &s;afe there without any
<PB N="334" REF="342">
great Hazard, ju&s;t when Captain <HI>Moor</HI> had made a De&s;cent upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> a Plantation to the Southward of <HI>Carolina,</HI> and return'd with con&s;iderable Booty. By &s;ome of the <HI>Colony</HI> his Proceedings were cen&s;ur'd with Inju&s;tice, being the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had not any No|tice of the Rupture between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> but all Stratagems are lawful in War.</P>
<P>Some time after, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> re&s;enting the U&s;age of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> fitted out five Sail of Men of War, and &s;everal Tran&s;ports, to repay them in their own Coin.</P>
<P>They landed eight hundred Men in the Bay, and &s;ent two Trumpeters to Sir <HI>Nathaniel John|&s;on,</HI> at that time Governour of <HI>Charles-town,</HI> to &s;urrender; but he &s;ent 'em word back, as the Place was intru&s;ted to him by the Queen his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he was re&s;olv'd to hold it out to the la&s;t. The Me&s;&s;engers inform'd their Admiral of Sir <HI>Nathaniel</HI>'s Re&s;olution, and likewi&s;e added, that the Town was too well Mann'd to be ea|&s;ily taken. He thought better on't, recall'd his Men, and &s;ail'd away.</P>
<P>This Attempt very much alarm'd the Coun|try, and put 'em upon fortifying <HI>Charles-town,</HI> which at pre&s;ent may laugh at all Attempts from a Foreign Foe, or the native <HI>Indians,</HI> who us'd before to infe&s;t 'em daily.</P>
<P><HI>Charles-town,</HI> or <HI>Charles</HI> City, the Capital of <HI>Carolina,</HI> is &s;ituated upon a Neck of Land form'd by a River on each &s;ide, (nam'd <HI>A&s;hley</HI> and <HI>Cooper</HI> Rivers, from the fir&s;t Plantations) well &s;tor'd with Fi&s;h. There was when I was there but an in|different wooden Church; but before I left the Place, Sub&s;criptions were taken in to build a regular Stone Building. There are upwards of a thou&s;and Hou&s;es, very neatly built, with Gar|dens almo&s;t to every Hou&s;e. There is Plenty of every Thing for the Life of Man to be
<PB N="335" REF="343">
found at <HI>Charles-town.</HI> It lies in 32 deg. 40 min. Northern Latitude. The Trade of this Place is more con&s;iderable for its Bigne&s;s than any other Plantation in <HI>America;</HI> it being the Southermo&s;t Settlement belonging to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> upon the Continent; and I have been inform'd they have Dealings three hundred Leagues up the Country, which is very much facilitated by the numerous navigable Rivers that come from the Mountains. The Climate is very whole&s;ome. Tho' mo&s;t <HI>Europeans</HI> have at their fir&s;t Arrival the Di&s;temper of the Country, which proceeds from Change of Air and Diet; yet I had the good Fortune to e&s;cape with a &s;well'd Arm, which had like to have ended in the Mortification of a Finger; but I was hap|pily cur'd by the Care and Advice of Madam <HI>Rhett,</HI> the only good Surgeon on the Place: Tho' were I to enumerate her other good Qua|lities, my &s;mall Tract would exceed in Bulk my Intentions: I &s;hall only &s;ay, another <HI>Dacter</HI> may be found in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;taid at <HI>Charles-town</HI> upwards of eight Months, and was well entertain'd by the courteous In|habitants; for I mu&s;t own Plea&s;ure as well as Profit induc'd me to travel, though I have no Inclination that way now.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> the Per&s;on concern'd with me in Trade, was oblig'd to go to <HI>Bermuda,</HI> being Secretary and Provo&s;t-Mar&s;hal of the <HI>Summer-I&s;lands;</HI> and in a &s;hort time after I follow'd with his Family. We met with no other Accident than a large Shark that follow'd our Ve&s;&s;el &s;e|veral Days together, and the Ma&s;ter told me he was well a&s;&s;ur'd &s;ome One on Board would die. I laugh'd at his Super&s;tition, and endeavour'd to rally him out of it, but he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his Opinion. When the Shark appear'd fir&s;t,
<PB N="336" REF="344">
every Body was in good Health, but in three Days time a Woman Pa&s;&s;enger expir'd of a Fever; whom we committed to the Waves, and was probably entombed in the Bowels of the Shark, for he took his leave of us the &s;ame Day. The Ma&s;ter told me he had made it his Ob&s;ervation for &s;everal Years, and was never once out. 'Tis not impo&s;&s;ible but the Shark at Sea has the &s;ame In&s;tinct as the Vulture at Land.</P>
<P>When I arriv'd at St. <HI>George</HI>'s, the Capital of <HI>Bermudas,</HI> I was as well pleas'd with the Cli|mate and Inhabitants as I was at <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>George</HI>'s Town is &s;eated in the Bottom of a Bay of the &s;ame Name, and is very well for|tify'd. It contains about two hundred Hou&s;es, with a Church &s;omething hand&s;omer than that of <HI>Charles-town.</HI> The Incumbent was the Reve|rend Mr. <HI>Holland,</HI> a Per&s;on of a good Under&s;tand|ing. I had a Pre&s;ent, an <HI>Antelope</HI>'s Foot &s;et in Gold, for a Tobacco-Stopper, which I was to deliver to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bangor,</HI> his Patron; but it was lo&s;t among my other Things in my Ship|wrack.</P>
<P>There is a perpetual Spring to be ob&s;erv'd in the&s;e I&s;lands, and the old Leaves never drop be|fore they are thru&s;t out by new ones. Their Fruit is in Blo&s;&s;oms, Buds, and Ripe at the &s;ame time. The Air is generally temperate and in|nubilous, but now and then troubled with vio|lent Thunder and Lightning; and I have been &s;hown &s;everal Rocks that they &s;ay were &s;plit by Lightning.</P>
<P>I was informed by a Gentleman that had coa&s;t|ed along the&s;e I&s;lands, that their Number a|mounts to 378, but above 300 of them de|&s;erve no other Name than Rocks; and mo&s;t of the others that are inhabited have not above half a dozen Hou&s;es upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="345">
The Soil of all the cultivated I&s;lands is a|like, being very fruitful; and &s;ome People ima|gine they were once join'd, making one intire I&s;land, but were divided as they are now by the Inno|vation of the Sea: And what gives them ground for this Opinion is, that the Waves daily le&s;|&s;en the &s;mall ones. But this is only Conjec|ture.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to &s;ay that the former Inhabitants gain'd much by Pirates; and even &s;ome that had large Plantations when I was there, were little better at fir&s;t than Sea-Robbers.</P>
<P>The late Queen being inform'd of it, order'd Mr. <HI>Larkins</HI> with a Commi&s;&s;ion to try Pirates, where-ever they re&s;orted in her Dominions in <HI>America.</HI> I happen'd to be at <HI>Bermuda</HI> when he arriv'd there. He acquainted the People in Power with his Commi&s;&s;ion, but met with a very cold Reception from 'em: But however, he procee|ded in his De&s;ign, and i&s;&s;u'd out Warrants to &s;eize the &s;u&s;pected Per&s;ons. Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> as Provo&s;t-Mar&s;hal, was oblig'd to execute the Warrants; but he met with Re&s;i&s;tance every where, and was very ill us'd by &s;ome of them, even to the Hazard of his Life.</P>
<P>The Governour, who&s;e Name was <HI>Bennet,</HI> as he repre&s;ented the Monarch of <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould have a&s;&s;i&s;ted Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> and Mr. <HI>Larkins;</HI> but whether he was afraid of offending the Inhabi|tants, or not enquiring truly into the Matter, Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> and Mr. <HI>Larkins</HI> were &s;eiz'd and com|mitted to Pri&s;on. Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> fir&s;t made his E|&s;cape, and arriv'd &s;afe in <HI>England;</HI> where he &s;et forth his Ca&s;e, and had all the Redre&s;s he de|&s;ir'd: He was order'd back, and re-in&s;tated in his former Po&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that oppos'd him, I am inform'd, had repri|manding Letters from <HI>England,</HI> upon his Account;
<PB N="338" REF="346">
but when Hate is fix'd in the Minds of &s;ome Men, 'tis never to be rooted out: Their Ani|mo&s;ities ro&s;e as high as ever, and he was once more oblig'd to abandon the I&s;land. There is now depending a Suit in Law between the Governour and Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who are both in <HI>Eng|land;</HI> and there is no doubt but Ju&s;tice will take Place.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Larkins</HI> was put into the Dungeon of the Pri&s;on, and it was the common Report, he was deny'd even Food to &s;u&s;tain Life; and would have certainly expir'd for Want, if he had not made his E&s;cape in the Habit of a Woman, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a true Friend; which is hard to find any where, but more e&s;pecially a|mong the Men of Power in <HI>America:</HI> But his Confinement had &s;o worn him, and he had con|tracted &s;o many Di&s;tempers by his Ill-U&s;age, that he expir'd in his Voyage home.</P>
<P>As I &s;aid before, this I&s;land was in former Times the common Receptacle for Pirates, and indeed their chiefe&s;t Gain proceeded from tra|ding with them. Here they came to &s;pend what Money they got, and recreate them&s;elves; it ly|ing very convenient for 'em, between 32 and 33 Degrees of N. Latitude, and 300 Leagues from the Continent or any other I&s;land.</P>
<P>Among their Trees, the <HI>Cedar</HI> is the mo&s;t plentiful, which they u&s;e even for Firing. I have &s;een Ve&s;&s;els of a hundred Ton built with Cedar; and mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es are compos'd of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Laws <HI>&s;hould</HI> be the &s;ame as tho&s;e in <HI>Eng|land;</HI> but Power is generally Chief Judge in <HI>A|merica:</HI> Yet if a Per&s;on never comes under the La&s;h of the Superior, there is very comforta|ble Living at <HI>Bermuda.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="347">
Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> Capt. <HI>Bayley,</HI> and my &s;elf, had joint|ly bought a Ve&s;&s;el of about 140 Ton, and we had got in all our Freight but Tobacco, which we were to take in at <HI>Virginia,</HI> and then make up with the Fleet for <HI>England.</HI> While we were fitting out our Ve&s;&s;el, Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was employ'd in his own Affairs, therefore the Care of his Share was committed to me.</P>
<P>We &s;et Sail from <HI>Bermuda, April</HI> 5, 1710, with a fair Gale, which continu'd till we lo&s;t Sight of the I&s;lands; but in the Night a con|trary Wind &s;prang up, and blowing very fre&s;h at N. N. E. carry'd us to the Southward of the <HI>Ber|mudas;</HI> and it was the greate&s;t Providence in the World we were not &s;tav'd upon the Rocks; but with great Difficulty we got clear of them, being oblig'd to ply it to Windward three Days.</P>
<P>We had the Misfortune to find our Ship none of the be&s;t Sailors; yet in four Days we got in our proper Latitude; and the Wind conti|nuing pretty fair, we made very good Way. We had no other Diver&s;ion than taking Dolphins with our Fizgig; but in my Opinion it is but indifferent Food.</P>
<P>We were forty one, including Pa&s;&s;engers; and many of tho&s;e being &s;ick with the Rocking of the Ship, made it uncomfortable living among them; and I wi&s;h'd my &s;elf once more on Shore.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 12 we were alarm'd at Sight of a Ve&s;|&s;el we di&s;cover'd, which we imagin'd to be a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Privateer. We crouded all the Sail we could to avoid her, which would have been ve|ry hard to do, if immediately after the Wind had not chang'd to S. S. E. a very &s;trong Gale. We bore away before it, and ere Night lo&s;t Sight of her.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="348">
As we were at Supper in the Cabin, a Son of Capt. <HI>Bayley</HI>'s came and told his Father that the Colour of the Water was chang'd; but his Fa|ther reprimanded him, and told him he had lo&s;t his Sen&s;es, for it was impo&s;&s;ible to be near any Shore. When the Sea changes its Colour, 'tis an evident Token Land is not far off. We con|tinu'd the &s;ame Cour&s;e under a Fore&s;ail; but our Terror and Surprize was not to be expre&s;t, when in the Morning Watch, the Captain, who being upon Deck di&s;cover'd Land right a-head, came down into my Cabin, and with Tears in his Eyes de&s;ir'd I would ri&s;e. I knew by his Looks &s;omething extraordinary was the Matter, and got upon Deck to be re&s;olv'd, for Capt. <HI>Bayley</HI> had not Power to utter a Word. I &s;oon found the Danger, for I perceiv'd we were in View of <HI>Virginia,</HI> near <HI>Ronoke</HI> Sand-Banks. We did all that was in our Power to weather 'em, but our Ship having a round Head, &s;he would not obey the Helm; therefore we all agreed to make in for the Land, hoping, as it &s;eem'd a bold Shore, it was Tide of Flood, and then we might through Providence land &s;afe. But it proving Tide of Ebb, we bulg'd upon the <HI>Ronoke</HI> Sand-Banks, but by lightning the Ship, and cutting our Ma&s;ts by the Board, we got clear of that; but keeping &s;till in for the Shore, we &s;truck upon the &s;econd Sand-Bank, but not very vio|lently, &s;o we threw out our Anchors in hopes we might ride out the Tide; but the Wind in|crea&s;ing, we dragg'd 'em, and were violently thrown upon another Sand-Bank, where our Ship &s;tuck, and the Waves da&s;h'd over us. We had &s;everal Women with Children on Board, and their di&s;mal Cries pierc'd my very Heart. We order'd the Boat out, to &s;ee if we could gain the Shore that way. I jump'd into her one of
<PB N="341" REF="349">
the fir&s;t, but ere we could leave the Side of the Ship, &s;he was &s;tav'd in Pieces. All we could do in this Exigence was get into the Ship again; and with much difficulty we compa&s;s'd it, being dragg'd in by main Force; yet if I had not held fa&s;t hold by the Coat of one that was in the Water with me, and the Foot of another, I mu&s;t have ine|vitably peri&s;h'd, for I was under the Keel. When I had got Footing upon Deck, I fetch'd my Box out of my Cabin, and was for &s;ecu|ring my Money, which amounted to Fifty Pound. While I was bu&s;ying my &s;elf with uncording my Box, the Captain's Si&s;ter reprimanded me for thinking on my Money, when all their Lives were in Danger. I mu&s;t own, other Thoughts had been more &s;uitable to my Condition, there|fore I was a&s;ham'd of what I was about, and had no other Regard than to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;aving our &s;elves. It prov'd a fruitle&s;s Labour in endeavou|ring to get off the Ve&s;&s;el, therefore we laid a|&s;ide all Hopes of &s;aving the Cargo.</P>
<P>We had two Blacks on Board that belong'd to Capt. <HI>Bayley,</HI> that were excellent Divers (for the Surge was &s;o violent no one could &s;tem the Billows but by diving) who offer'd to get with a Rope on Shore, and fa&s;ten it from the Ship to a Stump of a Tree; and divine Providence had &s;o order'd it, there was not any Thing like a Tree for half a Mile on each Side of us. I told the Captain it look'd like a good Omen, and, by the Help of God, I did not doubt but we &s;hould get &s;afe on Shore.</P>
<P>The <HI>Negroes</HI> with much Difficulty did as they had intended, and by the Help of the Rope came back to the Ship. Capt. <HI>Bayley,</HI> his Wife, and Mate, ventur'd into the Water fir&s;t, upon the Awning of the Ship, and got &s;afe on Shore; tho' it broke a&s;&s;oon as they were landed. But

my Ears are even pierc'd this Moment with the Cries of his poor Children that were in the Ship, which was more terrible to me than the Storm. I offer'd to help 'em upon the Rope, but they were in &s;uch Frights and Terrors that I could not prevail upon 'em to venture.</P>
<P>Two of the Sailors got upon the Rope ju&s;t as I was going to venture, and with their Bu&s;t|ling had very near thrown me once more into the Sea. I offer'd my A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Capain's Si&s;ter, but &s;he was as timorous as the Children, and fed her &s;elf with vain Hopes that the Waves would leave 'em by degrees, and they might with le&s;s Danger get on Shore. I took my Leave of all that were on Board, and recommending them and my &s;elf to the Care of Heaven, I got into the Water and laid fa&s;t hold on the Rope, and, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of one of the <HI>Negroes,</HI> got &s;ome Di&s;tance from the Ship; but the Waves drove back with &s;uch an Impetuo&s;ity that I was many times in Danger of lo&s;ing my Hold, and &s;o be carried into the main Sea; which had certainly came to pa&s;s, if I had not been a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by the Black; for every time a great Sea was coming to break over us, he would cry out, <HI>For the Lord's Sake, Ma&s;ter, hold fa&s;t:</HI> And whenever he call'd to me, I &s;ettled my &s;elf to receive the Force of the Waves, which would as oft over|whelm me; and I poured out my Prayers to God for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. At la&s;t, with much Strug|gling, I could feel my Feet touch the Ground &s;ometimes, and by degrees, with the utmo&s;t Dif|ficulty, got Footing; and at every Retire of the Waves &s;et my &s;elf to running. When they drove back upon the Shore, I &s;eiz'd upon the Rope, or otherwi&s;e I had been da&s;h'd to pieces on the Sand. But at la&s;t my Strength began to fail me, with the violent Fatigue I had under|gone;
<PB N="343" REF="351">
and if the <HI>Negro</HI> had not dragg'd me on the Sands, (who&s;e Strength al&s;o was almo&s;t gone) I mu&s;t, after all my Strugglings for Life, have re&s;ign'd my &s;elf to the Waves.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as I could recover my Spirits, I gave the divine Creator of all things, Thanks for my wonderful Delivery from the Jaws of Death; which was &s;till more wonderful, for a&s;&s;oon as I had let go the Rope (&s;ome other Per&s;ons venturing the &s;ame way) it broke, &s;o that not one of the unfortunate Wretches came on Shore, but were &s;wallow'd up by the Waves.</P>
<P>A-while after I had got on Shore, Captain <HI>Bayley,</HI> his Wife, and the Mate came down to me, and inform'd me that they could find no Road, nor any Inhabitants. This News re|new'd our Griefs, for we &s;eem'd to be in as much Danger of Starving now, as of Drowning before: And to increa&s;e our Dread, it was not above three Hours to Night, and then we had the wild Bears to fear.</P>
<P>While we were lamenting our Condition, we heard &s;omebody hollow up in the Woods, which reviv'd our drooping Sen&s;es: But running to &s;ee who it was, we, much to our Grief, found it to be one of the Sailors that e&s;cap'd, who was hollowing to his Companion; and they were both as drunk as 'twas po&s;&s;ible for them to be, with Rum, before they left the Ship. Such Bea&s;ts are &s;ome Sailors, that even the greate&s;t Dangers will not deter them from Drinking, if they have an Opportunity.</P>
<P>When we were all together, (that is, the Cap|tain, his Wife, and Mate, two white Sailors, two <HI>Negroes,</HI> and my &s;elf,) we re&s;olv'd to walk to the Southward, to &s;ee if it were po&s;&s;ible to find a|ny Habitations; but in le&s;s than an Hour, our
<PB N="344" REF="352">
Journey was &s;topp'd by an impenetrable Wood, and we were obliged to return.</P>
<P>We then went Northward, but were inter|rupted by large Swamps, and not the lea&s;t Mark of any Plantation. Thus, maroon'd as we were, we went back again, and could perceive the poor Wretches in the Ve&s;&s;el, lifting up their Hands to us for Succour; but we could neither give 'em A&s;&s;i&s;tance or Comfort. I made 'em Signs to let 'em know our Condition was as bad as theirs, and that they had nothing to think on but Heaven.</P>
<P>It growing near Night, &s;ome of the poor Creatures ventur'd into the Water, but were &s;oon drown'd. In &s;hort, every Object we be|held increas'd our Horror. None of us had eat or drank for two Days, be&s;ides our Fatigue. Tho' quite ca&s;t down my &s;elf, I endeavour'd to chear my Fellow-Sufferers; and that we might be &s;helter'd from the Inclemency of the Night (which, to add to our wretched Condition, prov'd a rainy one) we by joint Con&s;ent and La|bour, while the Day la&s;ted, pluck'd down a good Number of <HI>Palmetoe</HI> Leaves; and with Pieces of Trees (which we tore, for we had ne|ver a Knife among us) built us up a Hut, and &s;helter'd it from the Weather as well as we could.</P>
<P>The <HI>Palmetoe</HI> Leaf is very large, and the &s;ame that they make the plaited Straw of, which forms the fine&s;t Hats, that come from <HI>Bermuda</HI> and <HI>Carolina.</HI> It was a very melancholy Reflection to think of our Condition: Nothing to lie up|on but the bare wet Ground, and our Cloaths that cover'd us were tho&s;e upon our Backs, drop|ping with Rain and Salt-Water; no Food, nor Hopes of getting any; and I was even ready to expire with Thir&s;t. While the Hut was pre|paring,
<PB N="345" REF="353">
to allay my Drouth, I &s;tole by my &s;elf, urin'd in my Tobacco-Box, and drank it with as great a Gu&s;to as ever I have done <HI>French</HI> Claret before or &s;ince.</P>
<P>When I came to lie down in our wretched Tenement, the Place was full; but I e'en laid my &s;elf down upon 'em, (and tho' a Woman was among us, had no Thoughts of diffe|rent Sexes) and by degrees made Room for my &s;elf. Notwith&s;tanding their complaining of Legs and Arms, I held my Tongue, and, mau|gre all my Wants and Misfortunes, &s;lept &s;ound|ly till Morning: But with the Day Reflection return'd, &s;harpen'd with the extreame&s;t Hun|ger.</P>
<P>When we had got all together again, (that is, &s;even of us, for one of the drunken Sailors was found dead &s;ome Di&s;tance from our Cabin, as we might well imagine, with Cold and Want, and &s;poil'd an excellent Proverb, <HI>That drun|ken Men never get any Harm)</HI> by my Advice we addre&s;s'd our &s;elves to the All-&s;eeing Power for Succour; all but the Mate, who told us that Praying alone would not do, therefore while we <HI>pray'd,</HI> he would go <HI>&s;eek.</HI> After our extempore Ori&s;ons were over, we ro&s;e up, and re&s;olv'd to go into the Woods, to ga|ther, if it was po&s;&s;ible, &s;omething to kill our Hunger. But as we turn'd toward the Beach, we &s;aw the Mate with another Man, a Stran|ger to us, coming towards us. The Dove could not be a more plea&s;ing Sight to the Patriarch <HI>Noah,</HI> when he return'd with the Olive-Branch in his Mouth, than that Stranger was to us. We ran with all the Speed which our weak Condition would admit of, to meet him. Un|der his Arm he had got a little Tub of Butter that the Sea had thrown up; and though mixt
<PB N="346" REF="354">
with Sand and Gravel, we as greedily devour'd it as if it had been Partridge or Phea&s;ant; but our Misfortune was, when we had tir'd our &s;elves with Eating, for I can't &s;ay we were &s;a|tisfy'd, we all of us grew Sick, and ca&s;t it up again.</P>
<P>The Stranger, to relieve us, gave us a Couple of Limes among us, which we greedily devour'd, and to the Butter again. But what was a plea|&s;ing Surprize to us, our Mate inform'd us a Puncheon of fre&s;h Water was thrown on Shore. We eagerly ran, and my Tobacco-Box &s;erv'd us in&s;tead of a Cup. The Mate, who had &s;lak'd his Thir&s;t before, would not let us drink too much, for fear of endangering our Lives; but with this indifferent Repa&s;t we recover'd our fainting Spirits, and were more able to bear the Fatigue of the Day.</P>
<P>Our Ve&s;&s;el was drove clo&s;e on Shore, but broke in many Pieces; and it was a melancholy Sight to behold the dead Bodies covering the Sand: But what had almo&s;t kill'd Capt. <HI>Bayley</HI> and his Wife with Sorrow, were the Bodies of his Si&s;ter and one of his Children half buried in the Sands. For my own part, I had no other thing to grieve for but the Lo&s;s of my Cargo, which con&s;i&s;ted of <HI>Cotton, Indigo,</HI> and Straw Ware; which, if it had arriv'd &s;afe to <HI>England,</HI> would have yielded to my own Share fifteen hundred Pound: Tho' the Lo&s;s of my <HI>Harp&s;ichord</HI> and <HI>Italian Timbrel</HI> I mo&s;t regretted, who&s;e Remains I di&s;|cover'd upon the Shore; and the whole Strand was cover'd with <HI>Bermuda</HI> Hats. Some we pick'd up; and among other pieces of the Wreck, the Mate di&s;cover'd my Box floating on the Surface, which by good Fortune he dragg'd on Shore. In it was my Money, Linnen, and Books of Accounts. We kept this private from the
<PB N="347" REF="355">
Stranger, and bury'd it in a Place I had mark'd by &s;everal Ob&s;ervations: For he had given us to under&s;tand, it was his u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, after a vio|lent Storm, to come to the Sand-Banks in Ex|pectation of Shipwrecks; therefore we were not a&s;&s;ur'd he might not find Means to de&s;troy us in Hopes of what we had on Shore, or leave us without a&s;&s;i&s;ting us to &s;ome Plantation.</P>
<P>When we had done all we could about our Wreck, we took leave of the mi&s;erable Sight, and &s;et forward to the Stranger's Plantation, which was about ten Miles off. He led us a|long the Woods by certain Marks on Trees, which we were ignorant of; but the Inhabitants know how to find one another's Plantations by tho&s;e Marks; and in four Hours (for I had my Watch in my Pocket when I was &s;hipwreck'd) we once more beheld the plea&s;ing Sight of a Chimney &s;moaking, which was the Habitation of our Guide. You may imagine the Joy we had to enter once more into a Hou&s;e, after our mi&s;e|rable Hard&s;hips. But when we came there, we found but indifferent Accommodation. There were no other Eatables to be got, but a little hung Beef, and <HI>Humminy,</HI> (that is, <HI>Indian</HI> Corn ground, mix'd with Milk, and dry'd before the Fire:) but this was Fea&s;ting to us; for Hunger is the be&s;t Sauce.</P>
<P>There were but two Beds in the Hou&s;e, which the Family complimented us with. The Cap|tain and his Wife had one, and Mr. <HI>Burnam</HI> and I had the other.</P>
<P>I deferr'd going for my Box till the &s;econd Day after our Arrival; for I was very much out of Order with the Fatigue I had under|went; and by lying on the wet Ground I had lo&s;t my Hearing, which I did not recover through|ly till my Arrival in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="356">
The Mate, 'two <HI>Negroes,</HI> and my &s;elf, &s;et out with one to guide us to the Place of our Ship|wreck; but we were &s;o long in looking for my Box, that we were ready to give over all Search: But ju&s;t as we were thinking of returning, the Mate happily found it out.</P>
<P>The <HI>Negroes</HI> took it by Turns, and we brought it &s;afe to the Plantation.</P>
<P>I had a good Parcel of Linnen in it, which I lent to my Fellow-Sufferers: But it was an odd Sight to di&s;cover &s;o many Scare-crows, with tatter'd Coats and fine ruffled Shirts on.</P>
<P>Our Ho&s;t was very well &s;atisfy'd for our En|tertainment with what he found of the Wreck.</P>
<P>We &s;taid here five Days to refre&s;h our &s;elves, and then re&s;olv'd to go up the River to wait on Colonel <HI>Carew,</HI> Deputy-Governor of <HI>North-Ca|rolina;</HI> a Gentleman I had the Honour of being acquainted with. We hir'd a Canoo with two Sails, and embark'd, Capt. <HI>Baily,</HI> his Wife, the Mate, two Blacks and the Sailor, with another from the Plantation to a&s;&s;i&s;t us. We &s;ail'd up <HI>Ronoke</HI> Sound with a fre&s;h Gale, and at &s;even a-clock the next Morning &s;topp'd at Colonel <HI>Ca|rew</HI>'s Plantation, who out of his known Cour|te&s;y entertained us very hand&s;omely. We took our leaves, and at eight a-clock the &s;ame Even|ing came before the Governour's Hou&s;e, &s;ituate on the River <HI>Notaway,</HI> which runs into the <HI>Ro|noke</HI> about fifty Leagues from the Sea.</P>
<P>I &s;ent up one of the Men to acquaint the Governour I was come to wait on him; and up|on the In&s;tant he came down to the Shore, ac|company'd by Capt. <HI>Cratbach,</HI> a Native of <HI>Ber|muda</HI> I&s;land, and one I had long been acquain|ted with. He had left <HI>Bermuda</HI> &s;ince we came away, and the Governour and he had ju&s;t been wi&s;hing I had e&s;cap'd the Storm as the Me&s;|&s;enger came to him.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="357">
A&s;&s;oon as ever he &s;aw me, he cry'd out, I am &s;orry for your Misfortune, I can ea&s;ily perceive an ill Wind drove you hither. He would not &s;uffer us to talk much, but hurry'd the whole Company into his Dining-Room, where &s;tood a Supper and a Bowl of Punch, with &s;everal Gen|lemen his Gue&s;ts. He begg'd their Pardon, but told 'em they &s;hould neither eat nor drink be|fore we had &s;atisfy'd our &s;elves; and we &s;oon clear'd what was put before us: and then another Supper was provided for the whole Company, which we had our Shares of, notwith&s;tanding what we had eaten before.</P>
<P>The Governour was but ill provided with Beds, therefore Capt. <HI>Bayley</HI> and his Wife went to Mr. <HI>Glover</HI>'s, a neighbouring Gentleman; and the Se|cretary would have me home with him, about a Mile from the Governour's. When we came to his Hou&s;e, we found a Quarter of a <HI>Shote</HI> (a young Hog) and a Turkey on the Table. I &s;at down once more, and made a hearty Supper; and I mu&s;t own, I never thought I &s;hould bring my Stomach to its proper Tone again. After we had drank very heartily, we went to Bed. The next Morning we breakfa&s;ted upon broil'd Fowls and Chocolate. (<HI>My Readers, if any, I hope will not ridicule my taking Notice &s;o often of Eating, till&punc; they put them&s;elves in my &s;tarv'd Con|dition.)</HI></P>
<P>The next Day we went to dine with a Friend of the Secretary's; and as we were at Dinner, a Me&s;&s;enger came from the Governour and Capt. <HI>Bayley,</HI> to inform me a Ve&s;&s;el was going that In&s;tant for <HI>Kakatan,</HI> (a Harbour where the <HI>Virginia</HI> Fleet make up, and with the Convoy &s;et &s;ail all together for <HI>England)</HI> and that Capt. <HI>Bayley</HI> and the re&s;t of my unfortunate Company waited on Board for me. Notwith&s;tanding my Stomach,
<PB N="350" REF="358">
I was oblig'd to make all the Di&s;patch I could to the Place where the Ve&s;&s;el lay; but to my great Misfortune, the Wind proving fair for them, they were oblig'd to take the Advantage; and when I arriv'd at the Port they were al|mo&s;t out of Sight. I was very much concern'd at this Lo&s;s of my Pa&s;&s;age, for it was very pro|bable I might not get &s;uch another Opportu|nity till the Fleet was gone, and then I &s;hould be oblig'd to &s;tay till next Year.</P>
<P>The Governour &s;eeing me &s;o much concern'd, offer'd me his Hor&s;e to go to <HI>Kakatan</HI> by Land, about 120 Leagues from the Place where we were; and he procured me a Guide, an ho|ne&s;t <HI>Quaker,</HI> who for ten Pieces of Eight agreed to accompany me, and bring the Governour's Hor&s;e back again.</P>
<P>We &s;et out immediately; for I had no Lug|gage to carry: becau&s;e Capt. <HI>Bayley,</HI> as imagining I would come time enough, had got all my Things on Board.</P>
<P>We rode that Day about twenty Mile, thro' unfrequented Woods; but my Guide knew the Way by the above-mention'd Marks upon Trees. We came to a Quaker's Plantation; and all the Compliments my Guide us'd to him was only this, <HI>Friend, I have brought along with me a &s;hip|wreck'd Gentleman, who is going to</HI> Kakatan, <HI>and de&s;ires a Lodging to-night;</HI> who was an&s;wer'd by our new Ho&s;t, <HI>Friend, come in; thou art welcome.</HI> And indeed he made his Words good, for we had plenty of every thing, and a hand&s;ome Apart|ment to lie in, the be&s;t in the Hou&s;e. I was very much pleas'd with his Conver&s;ation, for I found him a Man of a &s;ound Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>In the Morning when I was going, I offer'd to pay him for what I had; but he &s;eem'd much offended at my Propo&s;ition. Said he, <HI>My Hou&s;e</HI>
<PB N="351" REF="359">
<HI>is no Inn, and we &s;ee Strangers &s;o very &s;eldom, that they are always welcome when they come; and God forbid that I &s;hould le&s;&s;en the Store of an unfortunate Man, like thy &s;elf.</HI> In &s;hort, this is the Treatment I met with in my &s;ix Days Travel. Ho&s;pitality is commendable in all Countries, and <HI>England</HI> was once famous for it, but it &s;eems at pre&s;ent bani&s;h'd to <HI>America.</HI> The third Day my Hor&s;e tumbled with me into a deep Swamp, and I was not only in danger of drowning, but of having my Brains da&s;h'd out with his Hoofs in his Floundering. I continu'd &s;o long in this Condition, that I gave my &s;elf up for lo&s;t; for my Guide could not come to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, without being in the &s;ame Danger. At la&s;t, my Hor&s;e, with much &s;truggling, got Foot on firm Ground; by good Fortune I had got hold of the Stirrup, and he drew me up with him, to the great Joy of my Guide, who gave me for gone.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t imagine I was not very ea&s;y in the re&s;t of my Day's Journey, which I was o|blig'd to ride all cover'd with Water and Mud. But our Ho&s;t, where we lay at Night, got all my Things clean and dry by the time I ro&s;e in the Morning.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t four Days we travell'd through va&s;t Woods, without &s;eeing any humane Creature, but at the Plantations where we din'd and &s;upp'd; and our Stages were very different, &s;ometimes more than twenty Mile a&s;under, and at other times not above &s;even. Mon&s;trous Snakes I &s;aw of different Kinds, but none attempted to come near us till the fifth Day; when, as we were riding along, my Hor&s;e gave a Start, and ran on with me five hundred Yards before I could &s;top him. I turn'd about, and &s;aw a <HI>Rattle-Snake,</HI> of a mon&s;trous Bulk, &s;pring at my Guide, who happen'd at that time to be behind me;
<PB N="352" REF="360">
and it was very well he was, for if I had been in his Place, I &s;hould certainly have met with Death, in not knowing how to avoid it.</P>
<P>Their manner of &s;pringing upon any thing is this; they fold them&s;elves up in Rings, then clap their Tail to the Ground, and dart upon their Prey: But as they are &s;ome time in do|ing it, a Per&s;on may avoid 'em, who knows their Manner.</P>
<P>There is but one Way to cure the Bite of the&s;e venomous Creatures, and that is to apply immediately the Fundament of a Fowl to the Wound, and keep it there till it be dead; which does not always happen. If the Fowl dies, there is Hope of a Cure; but if it does not, all the Phy&s;icians in the World can't help you. My Guide told me, this was one of the large&s;t he had ever &s;een. I believe it was near &s;ix Yards in Length, and as thick as a lu&s;ty Man's Thigh. It is very rare for 'em to come &s;o near the Roads, but this being little frequented per|haps was the Rea&s;on of it. The Rattle, which is in their Tail, makes an odd Sort of a Noi&s;e. When I was at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> a Gentleman &s;how'd me the Rattle. It was about a Yard and a half long, in &s;mall Joints, cover'd with a thin tran&s;pa|rent Skin, like your white Gold-beater's Skin. They &s;ay they have a Joint grows every Year; but I can't tell who can prove it. The Rattle, as it lay folded in my Hand, &s;eem'd &s;o light that if I had not &s;een it there I could not have perceiv'd it by the Weight.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Day's Journey was one of the plea|&s;ante&s;t I had ever travell'd in my Life, in a fine &s;weet Road, &s;haded by Trees for many Miles together, and through 'em on each &s;ide, nume|rous Plantations, with a well cultivated Glebe.
<PB N="353" REF="361">
The whole Pro&s;pect put me in Mind of the Vale of <HI>Eve&s;ham</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ixth Night I lay at the Father's of my Guide, having one Day's Journey more to reach <HI>Kakatan.</HI> Mr. <HI>Ratcliff,</HI> the Name of my Guide's Father, was Owner of a hand&s;ome Plantation up|on <HI>James</HI> River; and there were &s;o many about it that it look'd like a little Town.</P>
<P>The next Day after my Arrival, being <HI>Sun|day,</HI> there was a general A&s;&s;embly of the Bre|thren, and mo&s;t of the Elders din'd with Mr. <HI>Ratcliff.</HI> When Dinner was &s;erv'd, they began in their u&s;ual manner with their long Graces, and when one had made an end, another ro&s;e up to begin; but Mr. <HI>Ratcliff</HI> begg'd, upon my Ac|count, that they would for once abridge the Motion of the Spirit, and let it take its full Scope for an After-Grace.</P>
<P>We had Notice from <HI>Kakatan,</HI> that the Fleet would not &s;ail for &s;ome time; &s;o I &s;taid with my friendly Quaker four Days, who treated me very generou&s;ly. I call'd for his Son to di&s;mi&s;s him back to the Governor, with the Hor&s;es: As I was paying him the Money I agreed for, his Father coming in by Accident, was very an|gry with him, and declared he would di&s;own him for his Child if he took a Penny. I was not at all pleas'd with the Refu&s;al, for the poor Man had taken a great deal of Pains with me; wherefore meeting by Chance with four Yards of Mu&s;lin to be &s;old, I bought it, and made him a Pre&s;ent of it unknown to his Father; tho' I had &s;ome Difficulty to make him accept of it, after what his Father had &s;aid to him.</P>
<P>The fourth Day after my Arrival, we had No|tice the Fleet would &s;ail in a few Days. This gave me a great deal of Unea&s;ine&s;s; for I could not get to <HI>Kakatan</HI> without a Boat, and Mr.
<PB N="354" REF="362">
<HI>Ratcliff</HI>'s was broke to Pieces &s;ome time before I came there. But he &s;eeing the Unea&s;ine&s;s I labour'd under, procur'd one: Yet another Dif|ficulty aro&s;e, we could not gain, even for Money, any Body to row us. Well, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Ratcliff,</HI> &s;ince we have got a Boat, thou &s;halt not be made unea&s;ie for want of People to work it, I and my Children will go along with thee. Ac|cordingly we &s;et out, and arrived at <HI>Kakatan:</HI> But we were &s;urpriz'd not to find above five Sail there, and one of 'em that Ve&s;&s;el that Capt. <HI>Bayley</HI> went in; &s;o I had the Satisfaction of get|ting my Things again.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the Fleet's not being there, the Place was &s;o full of People in Expectation of it, that there was no Lodging to be had. I was not &s;o much concern'd for my &s;elf as for my generous Quaker, who was to meet with &s;uch bad Accommodation for his good Nature in ac|companying me.</P>
<P>I met with a Gentleman bound for <HI>England,</HI> one Mr. <HI>Le Cruce,</HI> at pre&s;ent a Wine-Merchant in St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s Lane, who &s;eeing the Shifts we were put to, offer'd me half his Bed, which I accepted of for my Friendly Quaker, but I could not prevail upon him to take it: therefore I lay with Mr. <HI>Le Cruce</HI> my &s;elf, and Mr. <HI>Ratcliff</HI> with his Sons made what Shift they could upon the Ground.</P>
<P>It was the Report of every one, that the Fleet would not get together in four Months, &s;o I re&s;olved to take a Trip to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> in the mean time.</P>
<P>I did not know how to fa&s;ten a Pre&s;ent up|on Mr. <HI>Ratcliff</HI> for his Civility, for he would not hear of any thing like it; but at la&s;t I found out this Method. I bought a Runlet of Rum, a Thing very much in E&s;teem among the Plan|ters,
<PB N="355" REF="363">
and I begg'd Mr. <HI>Ratcliff</HI> to add to the Ob|ligations I had already received from him, by taking Charge of it and a Letter to one Mr. <HI>Randal,</HI> a Planter in his Neighbourhood. In the Letter I &s;ent to Mr. <HI>Randal,</HI> was one in|clos'd for Mr. <HI>Ratcliff,</HI> where I inform'd him the Rum was to him, only as a &s;mall Acknow|ledgment for the many Obligations he had laid me under.</P>
<P>The next Day he and his Sons took their leave of me, even without taking any thing for the Hire of the Boat, tho' I had bargain'd for it before I left the Place.</P>
<P>The Ve&s;&s;el that was to carry me to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> was not clear'd of her Lading, therefore I was oblig'd to &s;tay &s;even Days at <HI>Kakatan,</HI> which is no Place of Re&s;ort but only once a Year, at the Time the Fleet makes up for <HI>England;</HI> &s;o there are not many Conveniences expected there.</P>
<P>The Day before I fail'd for <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> I re|ceiv'd a Letter from my Friendly Quaker, with a Pre&s;ent of a powder'd <HI>Shote</HI> and &s;everal Tur|kies, which he &s;ent me by Water.</P>
<P>The Letter was as follows.</P>
<LETTER>

<P><HI>I</HI> Receiv'd thy Pre&s;ent in a very particular man|ner; and tho' I am not very ea&s;y about it, yet I give thee my Thanks, with a Promi&s;e of a grate|ful Remembrance from me and mine. I pray thee to accept what I &s;end thee as from a real Friend; and I commit thee to God.</P>

<P>The Ve&s;&s;el had but one Cabin in it, which was taken up by a Woman-Pa&s;&s;enger; &s;o that I was oblig'd to make &s;hift to warp my &s;elf up in the Sail; and the Spray of the Waves beat|ing
<PB N="356" REF="364">
over us now and then, I had but a wet Lodg|ing; and tho' it was nothing to what I under|went before, yet I got more Cold by it. We made &s;o good Way that we got up to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> in <HI>Delaware</HI> River the &s;econd Evening; and we prevail'd upon the Ma&s;ter to &s;tay there all Night, where I got a good Lodging at a publick Hou&s;e, being the fir&s;t time I had paid for any thing &s;ince my Shipwreck.</P>
<P><HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> the Capital of the County of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> is a hand&s;ome well-built Town, &s;tanding upon an Eminence, which gives you a plea&s;ant View from the River <HI>Delaware.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> were the fir&s;t Founders, but did not po&s;&s;e&s;s it long. There are now above 500 hand&s;ome Hou&s;es, and Foundations for &s;everal more. As it is daily increa&s;ing in Wealth by Trade, we may imagine it will increa&s;e in Buildings and Inhabi|tants. I have been inform'd they have di&s;cover'd in the Neighbourhood of this Town a fine Iron Mine.</P>
<P>The Day following we din'd at <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> a lit|tle neat Town on the &s;ame River, con&s;i&s;ting of near three hundred Hou&s;es. We were very hand&s;omely entertain'd there by a Gentleman of the Place, who would accompany us to <HI>Phila|delphia.</HI> We had a plea&s;ant Voyage, with many delightful Pro&s;pects of Towns, Villages, and Plantations, on both &s;ides of the River; and in the Evening we landed at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Pen&s;ylvania.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pen&s;ylvania</HI> takes its Name from <HI>William Penn,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Son to Sir <HI>William Penn,</HI> Admiral of a Squadron in the <HI>Dutch</HI> War, where he be|hav'd like a Man of Courage and Conduct. His Son, the pre&s;ent Proprietor, met with &s;ome Difficulty in obtaining his Patent, by rea&s;on he
<PB N="357" REF="365">
had declar'd him&s;elf Head of the People call'd <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pen&s;ylvania</HI> is compos'd of all that Tract of Land, with its I&s;lands, Rivers, Coa&s;ts, and Bays, which lies from forty to forty-five Degrees of North Latitude, and is one of the riche&s;t Coun|tries in his Maje&s;ty's foreign Dominions.</P>
<P>The Air is plea&s;ant, whole&s;ome, and uncloud|ed, or very rarely overca&s;t. Tho' the Winter is &s;omething colder, and the Summer hotter than in <HI>England,</HI> yet the Inhabitants have known &s;e|veral Winters together without Fro&s;ts. The Day in the Summer is two Hours &s;horter than ours, and in Winter two Hours longer; which is re|ally better for Bu&s;ine&s;s of all kinds. And cer|tainly this is a Tract of Ground as well &s;eated as any in the World, for Plea&s;ure and Profit. It is bounded on the Ea&s;t by <HI>We&s;t-Jer&s;ey,</HI> on the We&s;t by <HI>Virginia, Canada</HI> on the North, and <HI>Mary|land</HI> on the South; all, except <HI>Canada,</HI> fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Settlements.</P>
<P>The original Inhabitants of all the&s;e Places are &s;uppos'd to be the ten Tribes of the <HI>Jews</HI> that were &s;catter'd; but from whence they de|rive their Authority, even for this Suppo&s;ition, I can't imagine. 'Tis true, &s;ome of the an|cient <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Cu&s;toms are among the <HI>Indians;</HI> but as every Nation and People have Cu&s;toms peculiar to them&s;elves, in my Opinion there is nothing to be gather'd from thence. 'Tis cer|tain they have &s;omething of the Countenance of the <HI>Jews,</HI> they ob&s;erve New Moons, and offer their Fir&s;t-Fruits to their Idols. They are mo&s;t of 'em well made, and exactly proportion'd in their Features, without the thick Lips and flat No&s;es of the <HI>Negroes.</HI> They are gene|rally good natur'd and inoffen&s;ive, &s;low to Anger, but hard to be appeas'd; a courteous
<PB N="358" REF="366">
and humane Behaviour will gain upon 'em more than Severity: It is very &s;eldom they wrong a good Ma&s;ter, but I have known 'em frequent|ly venture their Lives for 'em. Their Language is very lofty and high &s;ounding, but not copious, for one Word hath &s;everal Meanings. I'll give you, from my Friend Mr. <HI>Thomas,</HI> a &s;hort Spe|cimen.</P>
<P>Hodi hita nee huska apeechi, nee machi <HI>Pen&s;ylva|nia</HI> huska dogwachi ke&s;how apeechi nowa, huska hay|ly chetena koon peo.</P>
<P>Thus in <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI></P>
<P>Farewell, my Friend. I &s;hall go &s;hortly to <HI>Pen|&s;ylvania.</HI> We &s;hall have a cold Moon pre&s;ently, and hard Fro&s;ts will &s;oon follow.</P>
<P>They throw their Children into the Water a&s;&s;oon as born, to harden their Bodies. The Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Men is to fi&s;h or hunt, and the Women to Till their Ground, and look after their Children, who commonly go alone at nine Months. They are mo&s;t of them knowing in Botany; and if at any time vi&s;ited with Sick|ne&s;s, cure them&s;elves by their Knowledge in Herbs and Roots. They are exceeding charita|ble; and if any among 'em have the Misfor|tune to be lame or blind, they take care they &s;hall want for nothing. The Boys go a hunting or fi&s;hing with the Father at &s;ix Years old; and when they are experienced in both, and arrive to their &s;ixteenth Year, they may marry. The Girls &s;tay at home with their Mother, who in&s;tructs them in her Bu&s;ine&s;s. The Women are very mode&s;t and cha&s;te, and you can't affront them more than by &s;aying any thing to the contrary of either. Adultery is puni&s;h'd with Death a|mong 'em.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="367">
Their Habitations are generally mean and &s;mall, and their Uten&s;ils a Pot, and two or three Cala|ba&s;hes, with a Bowl; and when they travel, they lie in the Woods about a Fire, to keep the wild Bea&s;ts from them. They are People of a merry Di&s;po&s;ition, continually laughing and &s;inging, even at their Work. They have &s;ome particular Songs among 'em, though but indif|ferent Tunes, and their In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick are as poor. They are generally given to So|briety; but if they once get Liquor of the <HI>Eu|ropeans,</HI> they never give over till dead drunk; and I have &s;een 'em lye in the middle of the Roads and Streets, like &s;o many Dogs. A&s;&s;oon as ever they come to them&s;elves, they plunge into the Water, and gather &s;ome Herbs, &s;queeze 'em into a Calaba&s;h, which they drink; by which Means they are recover'd, and are never &s;ick after their Debauches. Their Age generally comes up to &s;eventy, and very few to eighty. I have heard one <HI>Indian</HI> &s;peaking to another, when on his Death-Bed, of the Uncertainty of this Life, and how happy he &s;hould be in the Company of their God, where would be no want of Corn, or Wood, or any Thing that was needful for him. But there is a great Number in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian Faith. There are <HI>Indian</HI> Schools to teach 'em Writing as well as Reading; and mo&s;t of 'em are very docile.</P>
<P>The Country of <HI>Pen&s;ylvania</HI> abounds with eve|ry thing nece&s;&s;ary for the Life of Man, even for the mo&s;t luxurious.</P>
<P>The Woods afford fine Pidgeons, Phea&s;ants, Quails, Partridges, Woodcocks, Snipes, wild Turkies, and various other Birds. About the Rivers, Gee&s;e, Ducks, Swans, Teal, Divers, Brands, &amp;c. In the Rivers (generally a gravelly Bottom) are to be found Herrings, Smelts,
<PB N="360" REF="368">
Roach, Dace, Eels, Perch, Salmon, Trout, Gur|nets, Shadds, Cats-heads, Sheeps-heads, and ma|ny more; with fine large Oy&s;ters, preferable to any I ever ta&s;ted in <HI>England;</HI> and when any of the&s;e are brought to Market, you may buy 'em very rea&s;onably.</P>
<P>The Wood produce Cedar, Mulberry, Vines, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> A&s;h, Che&s;nut, and the fine&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> Ships.

<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> were the fir&s;t Foreigners that came to the&s;e Parts; but they made but few Settle|ments; their chief Bu&s;ine&s;s was to trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> for Skins, Furrs, &amp;c. and give them in Exchange, Rum, Beer, and Sugar. The next that appear'd was a Colony from <HI>Sweden,</HI> who began to plant and manure the Ground. The <HI>Dutch</HI> were offended at the&s;e Interlopers, as they call'd 'em, and threaten'd to make War upon 'em; which was prevented by the <HI>Swedes</HI> &s;ur|rendring the Plantations to 'em, who return'd home.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Dutch</HI> War, Sir <HI>Robert Carr</HI> made a De&s;cent upon 'em, outed 'em quite, and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for the Crown of <HI>England</HI> in the Year 1666, and left a Relation of his, of the &s;ame Name, as Governour; but the next Year the <HI>Dutch</HI> got the Ma&s;tery again; and the few <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that were there, &s;ettled them&s;elves in the other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies, better provided with De|fence again&s;t an Invader.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> remain'd Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this plea&s;ant Country till the Peace was concluded between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and then it was deli|ver'd once again to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> but no great Progre&s;s was made there till 1682, the Year af|ter
<PB N="361" REF="369">
Mr. <HI>Penn</HI> had gain'd the Patent for it. In le&s;s than a Year there were a hundred Hou|&s;es built, and form'd into a Town, to which Mr. <HI>Penn</HI> gave the Name of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> (or Brother|ly Love.) A Place for its Situation very agree|able, &s;eated high upon a Neck of Land, form'd by two fine navigable Rivers, two hundred Miles from the Sea; yet Ships of five hundred Ton can unlade on the Key.</P>
<P>The Country about it is rich, well water'd and wooded; the Earth producing a va&s;t Increa&s;e. They reap their Corn about the Beginning of <HI>July.</HI></P>
<P>The Gardens and Orchards yield all Roots, Fruits and Flowers we have in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;e|veral peculiar only to the Country. The Air is &s;o healthy that there is no Occa&s;ion for Phy|&s;icians, being they find Cures for their acciden|tal Di&s;ea&s;es by Simples; and the People &s;o peace|ful, there's no want of a Lawyer among them; and if any Difference happens, a third Per&s;on makes up the Matter, without the Charge of a Law-Suit. This Country is divided into &s;ix Counties or Divi&s;ions, and each County &s;ends &s;ix Mem|bers to the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Philadelphia. Che&s;ter</HI> 6; <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> 6; <HI>Kent</HI> 6; <HI>Bucks</HI> 6; <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> 6; and <HI>Philadelphia</HI> 6. All the&s;e mention'd Places have Yearly Fairs, and Weekly Markets, being very conveniently &s;ituated for Commerce with the Country about 'em.</P>
<P>They have excellent Copper Mines, which pro|duce better Copper than any in <HI>England,</HI> both for Colour and Fine&s;s. Coal Mines have been lately found; and &s;everal mineral Waters that perform the &s;ame Office as <HI>Bath, Tunbridge,</HI> or <HI>Ep&s;om.</HI> There is al&s;o found good Stone for Building, that proves hand|&s;ome and la&s;ting, and another thin Stone which they Tile their Hou&s;es with, being much neater than our
<PB N="362" REF="370">
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tile. Al&s;o Load&s;tones, and the <HI>Salaman|der</HI> Stone, having a Sub&s;tance like Cotton in the Veins, which will not con&s;ume in the Fire.</P>
<P>The Woods produce Wolves, Panthers, Bears, Deer, Hares, Antelopes, Foxes, Rackoons, Rab|bets, Squirrels, Bevers, &amp;c. who&s;e Skins yield great Profit to the Taker; and a Creature call'd a <HI>Po&s;&s;um,</HI> that has a fal&s;e Belly into which the young ones retire in time of Danger: Al&s;o the Flying-Squirrel, with Wings like tho&s;e of a Bat; and I have often &s;een it fly from Tree to Tree.</P>
<P>Red Deer, Buffalos, and <HI>Elks</HI> are common in the Woods, and delicious Food; but they are generally purchas'd from the <HI>Indians,</HI> (tho' at a very rea&s;onable Rate) they being the People that be&s;t know how to hunt them. There is a Reward given 'em for killing a Bear or Wolf, which has very much le&s;&s;en'd the Num|ber of both; though any Per&s;on has the Liber|ty to hunt, fi&s;h, or fowl, without being mole&s;t|ed. There's al&s;o Plenty of Otters about the Rivers, and &s;uch a multitude of Frogs in the <HI>Swamps</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A <HI>Swamp</HI> is much of the &s;ame kind as the <HI>Boggs</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> that they di&s;turb you with their Croaking; e&s;pe|cially the <HI>Bull-Frog,</HI> that makes a Noi&s;e &s;omething like that Bea&s;t, and is the Ba&s;e to all the others.</P>
<P>If the di&s;tre&s;s'd People of <HI>England</HI> knew the Comforts of <HI>Pen&s;ylvania,</HI> and the ca&s;y Means there is of a Livelihood, they would never &s;tay where they are, in a continual Scene of Want and Mi|&s;ery. Even the meane&s;t Servant has better Wa|ges than tho&s;e in <HI>England.</HI> If criminal Per&s;ons were &s;ent over there, they would find Employ|ment, and yet be re&s;train'd in the Vices for which they were puni&s;h'd: For a Thief there is to return Four-fold what he has &s;tole; and if he has not wherewithal to do that, he's com|pell'd to work it out. But every thing is in
<PB N="363" REF="371">
&s;uch Plenty there, they would have no Occa&s;ion to exerci&s;e their Talents that Way.</P>
<P>Their Beef, Mutton, Pork, Lamb, Veal, &amp;c. is equal to our Meat in <HI>England,</HI> with which they trade to the <HI>Leeward-I&s;lands,</HI> and bring in Return, Rum, Sugar, Molo&s;&s;os, and Pieces of Eight. Their Hor&s;es are &s;trong, hand&s;ome, and hardy, and &s;eldom feed on any thing but Gra&s;s; and after the harde&s;t Day's Work, are turn'd out hot into the Fields, yet get no Harm.</P>
<P>The Country produces great Numbers of Ap|ple and Pear Trees, with which they make great Quantities of Cyder and Perry, that is very whole&s;ome and well ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>There are many large, beautiful, well-built Towns in the Province of <HI>Pen&s;ylvania,</HI> of which, as I &s;aid before, <HI>Philadelphia</HI> is the chief. It is a noble, large, and populous City, &s;tanding on as much Ground as our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> City of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> &s;eated upon a Neck of Land form'd by the Ri|vers <HI>Delaware</HI> and the <HI>Schuylkill,</HI> both navigable many Leagues above the City. It is built &s;quare in Form of a Che&s;s-Board, with each Front fa|cing one of the Rivers.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Streets near two Mile long, as wide as <HI>Holborn,</HI> and better built, after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manner. The chief are <HI>Broad-&s;treet, King-&s;treet,</HI> and <HI>High-&s;treet,</HI> tho' there are &s;everal other hand&s;ome Streets that take their Names from the Productions of the Country; as <HI>Mulberry, Wal|nut, Beech, Sa&s;&s;afras, Cedar, Vine, A&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Che&s;|nut Streets.</HI> From the&s;e Streets run great Num|bers of Courts, Yards, and Allies, with well-built Hou&s;es in 'em. There are &s;everal Coves and Docks where large Ships are built; and by a moderate Computation, there has been launch'd from the Stocks of this City in forty Year, near 300 Sail of Ships, be&s;ides Small-Craft, which may in &s;ome &s;ort
<PB N="364" REF="372">
give us an Idea of the Opulency of the Place. Many of their Merchants keep their Coaches, and the Trade&s;mens Shops and Streets are well frequented. All Religions are tolerated here, which is one Means to increa&s;e the Riches of the Place. The People of the Church of <HI>England</HI> as by Law e&s;tabli&s;h'd, have a neat, well-built Church, found|ed in the Year 1695, and I am inform'd the Foundation is laid for another. The <HI>Quakers</HI> (who are the major Part of the Inhabitants) have &s;eve|ral Meetings. There is a <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> reform'd Church, Mr. <HI>Rudman</HI> the Incumbent, a Man of &s;ingular Learning and Piety; who is as much follow'd by the <HI>Quakers,</HI> when he preaches, as the <HI>Prote&s;tants.</HI> I &s;hall beg leave to give one In&s;tance of his Humility and Piety. When Sub&s;criptions were taking in to build the Church, he &s;ub&s;crib'd a con&s;iderable Sum; but when call'd upon for the Money, he had it not in his Power to pay it; yet to keep his Word, he contracted with the Ma&s;ter-Builder for &s;o much a-day, to carry the Hod, till he had work'd his Sub&s;cription-Money out. This was an In&s;tance of his Piety and Zeal for Religion; and I fancy if Churches were to be built after the &s;ame Manner in a cer|tain I&s;land, the Work would go but &s;lowly on. There are &s;ingle Hou&s;es upon the Key that have co&s;t 6000 <HI>l.</HI> the Building. Mr. <HI>Badcock</HI>'s Brew|hou&s;e is a noble, large Building, and has in it one &s;ingle Ve&s;&s;el that will hold eight Ton of Liquor.</P>
<P>In this City is held the Courts of the Province, and the A&s;&s;embly meet here, which is in the nature of a dependant Parliament, as in tho&s;e Cities of <HI>France</HI> that are di&s;tant from the Capi|tal. There are three Fairs in the Year, and e|very Week two Markets. In time of the Fairs the City is &s;o throng'd, as well as the adjacent Plantations, that it is hard to find a Lodging.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="373">
The Government and Con&s;titutions are the &s;ame as in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Their Council is compos'd of the Prote&s;tants and Quakers, but the Publick Officers are taken out of the former. The Governour is nomina|ted by the King of <HI>England,</HI> and the re&s;t of the ci|vil Officers are, Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, four Judges, a Judge of the Admiralty, Secretary, Attor|ney-General, Trea&s;urer, Publick Regi&s;ter, Clerk of the Peace, as al&s;o a Commi&s;&s;ary, and a Survey-or-General. The&s;e, with eight Members of the Council, form the Government of the City. The Number of the Inhabitants is generally &s;up|pos'd to be upwards of 15000, be&s;ides Slaves. There is hardly any Trade in <HI>England</HI> but the &s;ame may be met with in <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> and every Mechanick has better Wages; a Journeyman Taylor has twelve Shillings a Week, be&s;ides his Board; and every other Trade in Proportion has the &s;ame Advantage.</P>
<P>There is a Po&s;t-Office lately erected, which goes to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-England, Charles-town</HI> in <HI>Carolina,</HI> and the other neighbouring Places. The uncultivated Ground, which is not grubb'd, &s;ells for ten times the Value it did at fir&s;t; though there is none of that &s;ort within ten Miles round the City: And that within the Neighbourhood that was &s;old for ten Pound at fir&s;t, will fetch a|bove three hundred now. All Women's Work is very dear there, and that proceeds from the &s;mallne&s;s of the Number, and the Scarcity of Workers; for even the meane&s;t &s;ingle Women marry well there, and being above Want are above Work. The Proprietor of this fine Coun|try (as I &s;aid before) is <HI>William Pen,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who has a &s;ine Seat call'd <HI>Pensbury,</HI> built on three I&s;lets, if I may &s;o call 'em; for a Branch of the River <HI>Delaware</HI> runs thrice round it. In his Orchards and Gardens may be found all the
<PB N="366" REF="374">
Fruits, Roots, and Herbs that are in <HI>England,</HI> and many more peculiar to the Country. There is very good Paper made in <HI>Pen&s;ylvania,</HI> Linen, Druggets, Crapes, Camblets, and Serges, with which they trade. Mo&s;t of the Merchants, and &s;ome Trade&s;men, have hand&s;ome Country Hou|&s;es, well and conveniently furni&s;h'd. No In&s;ults from the <HI>Indians</HI> were ever heard of here, which is more than any of our other Plantations up|on the Continent can &s;ay; neither are there any of them us'd as Slaves, but they are paid as well as the <HI>Europeans</HI> for their Commodities or Labour; and there are more Chri&s;tians among 'em than in any other Nation in <HI>America,</HI> for their Num|ber. Mo&s;t of them bring up their Children to read and write, and &s;ome of them are bound Apprentice to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> who prove as good Workmen at the Bu&s;ine&s;s they follow as their Ma&s;ters. In &s;hort, in the mid&s;t of War they enjoy the Tranquility of Peace. They are too far di&s;tant from the Sea to fear the Inva&s;ion of a foreign Enemy, and there are &s;everal Places of Strength upon the River of <HI>Delaware,</HI> before they can arrive at <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> Yet when I was there, the Town was alarm'd with a fal&s;e Report that the <HI>French</HI> had landed within the Bay, and committed &s;everal Acts of Ho&s;tility. It was judg'd by &s;ome, that this Report was &s;pread abroad, on purpo&s;e to &s;ee how active the Peo|ple would be to defend them&s;elves, and whether the <HI>Quakers</HI> were to be depended upon in ca&s;e of an Inva&s;ion. The Governor got at the Head of about 700 Men, and exhorted the <HI>Brethren</HI> to &s;tand up for the Defence of their Lives and E&s;tates; but they declar'd the carnal Weapon did not belong to them, yet they would retire and pray for us. The People of the Town brought out their Provi&s;ion and Liquor, and
<PB N="367" REF="375">
freely gave it among the Soldiers, who made as free with it. Before Night, News came that it was a fal&s;e Alarm, which I believe did not di&s;plea&s;e any of us.</P>
<P>In the Heat of the Day I &s;ometimes took a Walk with &s;ome of the Town to <HI>Fair Mount,</HI> a plea&s;ant Place &s;haded with Trees on the Ri|ver <HI>Schuylkill.</HI> As we were coming home one Day, deep in Di&s;cour&s;e with one another, as I was &s;tepping over a Stile, I &s;aw &s;tretch'd on the Ground before me a Snake, as I &s;uppo&s;e a&s;leep. I had not Power to draw my Leg back again, but my Foot fell ju&s;t upon the Head and part of the Neck of the Reptile, more by the particular Direction of Providence, than my De&s;ign. It &s;prung up &s;o quick, and twi&s;ted round my Right Leg and Body with &s;uch Force that I was in Fear of being &s;trangled; however, I kept my Foot fix'd fa&s;t upon its Head, and in a little time it fell down dead. It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for Words to de&s;cribe what I felt at this Ac|cident; the very Touch of it about my Leg and Body had very near taken away my Breath: and it was the greate&s;t Providence in the World I did not take my Foot from the Head of the Snake; for if I had, it would certainly have bit me. It was a con&s;iderable time before I could &s;hake off my Apprehen&s;ion, and I was downright &s;ick with the Fright the whole Day after. Some of my Companions had the Curi|o&s;ity to mea&s;ure it: It was in Length two Yards nine Inches, and ten Inches about from the Neck to within a Yard of the Tail. I re|member very well, after this Accident, whene|ver I had Occa&s;ion to cro&s;s a Stile, in <HI>Pen&s;yl|vania</HI> or <HI>Old England,</HI> I ever took Care to look before me; &s;o la&s;ting is the Impre&s;&s;ion of Fear and Danger upon the Minds of Men.</P>

I continu'd at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> near four Months, and was very well entertain'd by the Gentle|men of the Place: I am pleas'd I have it in my Power to pay 'em my publick Acknow|ledgment of Thanks for all their Favours; par|ticularly the Reverend Mr. <HI>Brooks,</HI> whom I met with by Chance at <HI>Philadelphia:</HI> His Bu&s;ine&s;s there was to rai&s;e Sub&s;criptions for a new Church near <HI>New-York:</HI> When he heard of my Misfor|tunes, he was &s;o generous and charitable as to offer to lend me a Sum of Money he had in his Hands, upon my bare Word only, which I was to return to him from <HI>England</HI> by the So|ciety for Propagating the Go&s;pel in Foreign Parts. As I was not in want of it, I did not accept his intended Favour, but I &s;hall ever gratefully remember his kind Intentions.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget the many Obligations I had the Honour to receive from his Excellency Go|vernor <HI>Evans,</HI> nor Mr. <HI>Evans</HI> the Commi&s;&s;ary, who was particularly civil to me. The&s;e Gen|tlemen, tho' of the &s;ame Name, are no other|wi&s;e related than by marrying the Daughters of Mr. <HI>Moor,</HI> the Collector of the King's Cu&s;toms. The Commi&s;&s;ary is ju&s;t gone for <HI>Philadelphia</HI> a|gain, having been in <HI>England</HI> near a Twelve|month, about an Affair between the pre&s;ent Governor Sir <HI>William Keith</HI> and him, relating to the King's Cu&s;toms. Among the re&s;t of my Friends, I mu&s;t not forget the facetious Mr. <HI>Staples,</HI> Dancing-Ma&s;ter, who was the fir&s;t Stran|ger of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> that did me the Honour of a Vi&s;it, and to his merry Company I owe the pa&s;&s;ing of many a dull Hour, that probably might have lain heavy upon the Hands of a Man under my Circum&s;tances, depriv'd of Fortune, in a &s;trange Country, having no Friends, in who&s;e Power it was to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, nearer than

<HI>England;</HI> for Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was too much involv'd in his own trouble&s;ome Affairs at <HI>Bermuda,</HI> to expect any thing from him. But the Genero&s;i|ty of the <HI>Philadelphians</HI> is rooted in their Na|tures; for it is the greate&s;t Crime among them not to &s;how the utmo&s;t Civility to Strangers: And if I were oblig'd to live out of my native Country, I &s;hould not be long puzzled in find|ing a Place of Retirement, which &s;hould be <HI>Phi|ladelphia.</HI> There the oppre&s;s'd in Fortune or Principles may find a happy <HI>A&s;ylum,</HI> and drop quietly to their Graves without Fear or Want.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> News arriv'd that the Fleet would be ready to &s;ail from <HI>Kaka|tan</HI> the latter End of the Month, &s;o that I now began to bend my Thoughts towards my native Country. I pick'd up at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> four more Companions that intended the &s;ame Voyage; and <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 5 we took leave of our Friends, and the lovely City of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> which I &s;hall always remember with the utmo&s;t Satisfaction. We hir'd a Boat to carry us down the <HI>Dela|ware,</HI> and lay the fir&s;t Night at a Planter's, an Acquaintance of one of my Companions, who treated us with the u&s;ual Civilities of the Coun|try. The next Day we din'd on Board our Boat, and at Night arriv'd at <HI>Lewis,</HI> about 50 Leagues from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and 20 from the Sea. We &s;taid here three Days. This Town is the Capital of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> County, and is built upon the <HI>Hoorkill,</HI> a River that runs into the <HI>Delaware.</HI> A little below begins the Bay of <HI>Delaware,</HI> which is form'd by Cape <HI>William</HI> and Cape <HI>James,</HI> this la&s;t is the utmo&s;t Bounds of <HI>Pen|&s;ylvania.</HI> While we &s;taid here, I had the Curio|&s;ity to go into the Woods to &s;ee 'em gather Honey, it being free for any one, which pro|ceeds
<PB N="370" REF="378">
from its great Plenty; and you may buy the be&s;t Bees-wax at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> for four Pence a Pound. At <HI>Lewis</HI> we had &s;ome of the lar|ge&s;t Oy&s;ters and Cockles I ever &s;aw in my Life; &s;ome of the former were &s;ix Inches Diameter out of the Shell, and very well ta&s;ted. At this Place they make a rich Soup, compos'd of the&s;e, and other Shell-fi&s;h, which is very nouri&s;hing and palatable. From <HI>Lewis</HI> we were to walk over an I&s;thmus of eight Mile, that parts <HI>Delaware</HI> River, and <HI>Che&s;apeak</HI> Bay, which would &s;ave us three or four Days Sailing, for we had Notice of a Ship call'd the <HI>Globe,</HI> a new Ve&s;&s;el of near five hundred Ton, and twenty-four Guns, that was at <HI>Kakatan,</HI> and would be willing to receive Pa&s;&s;engers. We &s;et out from <HI>Lewis</HI> with Hor&s;es to carry what little Baggage we had, but we cho&s;e to walk it on Foot our &s;elves. We din'd at a plea&s;ant Plantation about the mid-way of our Journey, but found it a difficult matter to prevail upon a Couple of young Girls to come near us at fir&s;t, for they took us for Privateers; but at la&s;t we prevail'd upon 'em, and they call'd their Father, &amp;c. who made very much of us. One of the Girls perceiving I had a Watch in my Hand to &s;ee what time of Day it was, begg'd to look up|on it; but it was very plea&s;ant to &s;ee her Fear, when &s;he touch'd it, and would not be per&s;ua|ded but it was alive, from its going and the Noi&s;e it made. I ask'd her if &s;he had never &s;een or heard of a Watch before. She told me &s;he had never &s;een one, but her Si&s;ter had read of 'em. I only mention this to &s;hew the Sim|plicity and Innocence of tho&s;e Inhabitants of <HI>America,</HI> that live retir'd in the Country; for they told me they had neither of 'em been four

Mile from their own Hou&s;e in their Lives.</P>
<P>We took Leave of our Planter and his Fa|mily, and got that Night to a Plantation on <HI>Che&s;apeak</HI> Bay, where we lay all Night, and were well entertain'd. The next Day we &s;et about getting a Boat to carry us to <HI>Kakatan;</HI> but we met with a great deal of Difficulty in procuring one, and were three Days before we could &s;ucceed; but at la&s;t we got one by Accident, that was coming up the Bay. We got on Board, and arriv'd at <HI>Kakatan</HI> the &s;ame Evening. <HI>Kakatan</HI> is no more than a large Cove, where all the Fleet rendezvous in order to &s;et Sail for <HI>England.</HI> There are &s;ome few Hou&s;es &s;catter'd up and down the Bay, which go at great Rates upon this Occa&s;ion. It lies about ten Leagues up the River of <HI>Che&s;apeak;</HI> which River divides <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland.</HI> It is the greate&s;t River upon the Continent in the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Dominions, and the farthe&s;t navigable up in the Country; and many other Rivers fall into it. We enquir'd for the <HI>Globe,</HI> and &s;oon agreed with the Captain for his great Cabin, at a rea|&s;onable Rate, and he &s;eem'd pleas'd with his Company. We provided what little Nece&s;&s;aries we wanted, as &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, Liquor, &amp;c. and on <HI>Sept.</HI> 4. the Commadore hung out the Signal for Sailing.</P>
<P>I thought it was a noble Sight to &s;ee &s;o ma|ny Ships under Sail all together. There were upwards of two hundred Sail of Merchant-Men, be&s;ides four Sail of Men of War for our Con|voy.</P>
<P>We drove down the River, and at Night got over-again&s;t the <HI>Virginia</HI> Capes, Cape <HI>Hen|ry</HI> and Cape <HI>Charles,</HI> which form the Mouth of <HI>Che&s;apeak</HI> Bay. The next Day we left the
<PB N="372" REF="380">
main Land a&s;tern, and we had Orders from the Commadore to &s;pread our &s;elves, for fear we &s;hould fall foul of each other in the Night. We continu'd &s;ailing &s;everal Days together with a pro&s;perous Gale. <HI>Sept.</HI> 28, the Skies threat|en'd us with a Storm; we reev'd our Sails in Expectation of it, but it blew &s;o violently at la&s;t that we were oblig'd to lie under a reeft Fore&s;ail; and it was well we had a good &s;tout Ship under us, or we had peri&s;h'd. Our Fleet was &s;oon &s;catter'd, and we &s;aw &s;everal of them &s;ink in View, with their whole Crew; and it was not in the Power of the other Ships to &s;uccour 'em. I now began to think I &s;hould be bury'd in the Deep, tho' our Captain al|ways gave us great Hopes in the Goodne&s;s and Strength of the Ship; for &s;he was well rigg'd and fitted, it being her fir&s;t Voyage. We were terribly to&s;s'd all Night, and when the Morning dawn'd, we could not perceive one of the Fleet; &s;o we were oblig'd to &s;ail alone, which gave me many melancholy Reflections: However, we had this to comfort us, that the Storm was a|bated; and the next Day, to my great Joy, we di&s;cover'd forty of our &s;catter'd Fleet, and one Man of War. When we could come within Hailing, we receiv'd a di&s;mal Account of the Lo&s;s of above thirty of the Fleet, that founder'd at Sea. Some of the Men were &s;av'd, as al&s;o part of the Cargo of &s;even or eight, but the re&s;t went to the Bottom.</P>
<P>One Rea&s;on of the Weakne&s;s of the Ships was their being un&s;heath'd; and &s;taying four Months beyond their u&s;ual Time, the Worms had got into their Bottoms.</P>
<P>We &s;ail'd together with a fair Wind till we came upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> and then we had
<PB N="373" REF="381">
the Misfortune of being di&s;pers'd in the Night; and our Danger was the greater in being &s;o near an Enemy's Country. The next Day we per|ceiv'd a Sail making up to us: We &s;oon di&s;|cover'd it was a <HI>French</HI> Privateer. There were three Ships of us in Company: we got together to con&s;ult, and at la&s;t it was agreed to prepare for the Fight, though in a very poor Condition for an Engagement. Some of the Sailors ad|vis'd us to meet 'em, which Advice was taken. We immediately crouded all the Sail we could, and got our Hands upon Deck, Pa&s;&s;engers and all; and having the Wind of 'em, we bore down upon 'em, which had the de&s;ired Effect; for a&s;&s;oon as they perceiv'd us cha&s;ing 'em, they made all the Sail they could to get from us, and in a little time got out of our Sight. We were very well pleas'd with our Stratagem, and continu'd our Cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 3, we di&s;cover'd <HI>England,</HI> who&s;e Chalky Cliffs gave us all a va&s;t Delight. We coa&s;ted along the Channel with the plea&s;ing Hopes of once more fetting our Feet upon our native Country; and <HI>Nov.</HI> 7. we got &s;afe into <HI>Deal</HI> Harbour. We &s;taid there but one Night, and hir'd Hor&s;es to go to <HI>Canterbury;</HI> from whence we took a Coach to <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and the next Day went in the Pa&s;&s;age-Boat to <HI>London.</HI> As we were going up the River, a Ship out|ward-bound came &s;o &s;uddenly upon us, that we were in the utmo&s;t Danger of being run over. Mo&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;engers got up, ready to lay hold of the Tackling of the Ship to &s;ave them|&s;elves; but by Providence, &s;he mi&s;t us by about two Inches. This put me in Mind of the Un|certainty of Human Life, and that a Man may
<PB N="374" REF="382">
meet with Death, when he imagines him&s;elf pa&s;t all Danger.</P>
<P>I landed at <HI>London, Nov.</HI> 15, 1710. I gave God Thanks for his many and &s;ignal Mercies, where I hope I am &s;ettled for the Remnant of my Life, without tru&s;ting my &s;elf any more to the Dangers of the tempe&s;tuous Sea.</P>
