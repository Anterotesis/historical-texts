<L>Not daring open to appear,</L>
<L>Lodg'd covert <HI>Mi&s;chief; Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> hung</L>
<L>On his lip quiv'ring; on his tongue</L>
<L><HI>Fraud</HI> dwelt at large; within his brea&s;t</L>
<L>All that makes Villain found a ne&s;t,</L>
<L>All that, on hell's complete&s;t plan,</L>
<L>E're join'd to damn the heart of man.</L>

<L>Soon as the Car reach'd land, He ro&s;e,</L>
<L>And with a look which might have froze</L>
<L>The heart's be&s;t blood, which was enough</L>
<L>Had hearts been made of &s;terner &s;tuff</L>
<L>In Cities than el&s;ewhere, to make</L>
<L>The very &s;toute&s;t quail, and quake,</L>
<L><PB N="212" REF="87">He ca&s;t his baleful eyes around;</L>
<L>Fix'd without motion to the ground,</L>
<L>Fear waiting on &s;urprize, All &s;tood,</L>
<L>And Horror chill'd their curdled blood.</L>
<L>No more they thought of <HI>Pomp,</HI> no more</L>
<L>(For they had &s;een his face before)</L>
<L>Of <HI>Law</HI> they thought; the cau&s;e forgot,</L>
<L>Whether it was or Gho&s;t, or Plot,</L>

<L>What could be done? Could Art, could Force,</L>
<L>Or Both direct a proper cour&s;e</L>
<L>To make this &s;avage Mon&s;ter tame,</L>
<L>Or &s;end him back the way he came?</L>
<L>What neither Art, nor Force, nor Both</L>
<L>Could do, a <HI>Lord</HI> of foreign growth,</L>
<L><HI>A Lord</HI> to that ba&s;e wretch allied</L>
<L>In Country, not in Vice and Pride,</L>
<L>Effected; from the &s;elf-&s;ame land,</L>

<L>The Poi&s;on came, and Antidote.</L>

<L>Of Public Virtue, MANSFIELD came.</L>
