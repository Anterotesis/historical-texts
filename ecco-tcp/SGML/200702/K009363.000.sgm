<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_MY expectations in this &s;mall perform|ance
may &s;eem &s;omewhat extraordi|nary,
when I declare that my inten|tions
are to render a larger work
more intelligible to ordinary capacities,
by abridging it. 'Tis however certain, that tho&s;e
who are not accu&s;tomed to ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, are apt
to lo&s;e the thread of argument, where it is drawn
out to a great length, and each part fortified with all
the arguments, guarded again&s;t all the objections,
and illu&s;trated with all the views, which occur to
a writer in the diligent &s;urvey of his &s;ubject. Such
Readers will more readily apprehend a chain of rea|&s;oning,
that is more &s;ingle and conci&s;e, where the
chief propo&s;itions only are linkt on to each other, il|lu&s;trated
by &s;ome &s;imple examples, and confirmed by a
few of the more forcible arguments. The parts ly|ing
nearer together can better be compared, and the
connexion be more ea&s;ily traced from the fir&s;t principles
to the la&s;t conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE work, of which I here pre&s;ent the Rea|der
with an ab&s;tract, has been complained of as ob|&s;cure
and difficult to be comprehended, and I am apt
to think, that this proceeded as much from the length
as from the ab&s;tractedne&s;s of the argument. If I
have remedy'd this inconvenience in any degree, I
have attain'd my end. The book &s;eem'd to me to have
&s;uch an air of &s;ingularity, and novelty as claim'd the
<PB REF="3">
attention of the public; e&s;pecially if it be found, as
the Author &s;eems to in&s;inuate, that were his philo&s;o|phy
receiv'd, we mu&s;t alter from the foundation the
greate&s;t part of the &s;ciences. Such bold attempts are
always advantageous in the republic of letters, becau&s;e
they &s;hake off the yoke of authority, accu&s;tom men to
think for them&s;elves, give new hints, which men of
genius may carry further, and by the very oppo&s;ition,
illu&s;trate points, wherein no one before &s;u&s;pected any
difficulty.</P>
<P>THE Author mu&s;t be contented to wait with
patience for &s;ome time before the learned world can
agree in their &s;entiments of his performance. 'Tis his
misfortune, that he cannot make an <HI>appeal to the peo|ple,</HI>
who in all matters of common rea&s;on and elo|quence
are found &s;o infallible a tribunal. He mu&s;t be
judg'd by the FEW, who&s;e verdict is more apt to be
corrupted by partiality and prejudice, e&s;pecially as no
one is a proper judge in the&s;e &s;ubjects, who has not
often thought of them; and <HI>&s;uch</HI> are apt to form to
them&s;elves &s;y&s;tems of their own, which they re&s;olve
not to relinqui&s;h. I hope the Author will excu&s;e me
for intermeddling in this affair, &s;ince my aim is only
to encrea&s;e his auditory, by removing &s;ome difficulties,
which have kept many from apprehending his mean|ing.</P>
<P>I have cho&s;en one &s;imple argument, which I have
carefully traced from the beginning to the end. This
is the only point I have taken care to fini&s;h. The re&s;t
is only hints of particular pa&s;&s;ages, which &s;eem'd to
me curious and remarkable.</P>

<HEAD>AN
ABSTRACT
OF
A BOOK lately PUBLISHED,
ENTITULED,
<HI>A Treati&s;e of Human Nature,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS book &s;eems to be wrote up|on
the &s;ame plan with &s;everal
other works that have had a
great vogue of late years in <HI>Eng|land.</HI>
The philo&s;ophical &s;pirit, which has
been &s;o much improved all over <HI>Europe</HI> with|in
the&s;e la&s;t four&s;core years, has been carried
to as great a length in this kingdom as in any
other. Our writers &s;eem even to have &s;tart|ed
a new kind of philo&s;ophy, which promi|&s;es
more both to the entertainment and ad|vantage
of mankind, than any other with
which the world has been yet acquainted.
Mo&s;t of the philo&s;ophers of antiquity, who
treated of human nature, have &s;hewn more
<PB N="6" REF="5">
of a delicacy of &s;entiment, a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of
morals, or a greatne&s;s of &s;oul, than a depth of
rea&s;oning and reflection. They content them|&s;elves
with repre&s;enting the common &s;en&s;e of
mankind in the &s;tronge&s;t lights, and with the
be&s;t turn of thought and expre&s;&s;ion, without
following out &s;teadily a chain of propo&s;itions, or
forming the &s;everal truths into a regular &s;cience.
But 'tis at lea&s;t worth while to try if the &s;ci|ence
of <HI>man</HI> will not admit of the &s;ame accu|racy
which &s;everal parts of natural philo&s;ophy
are found &s;u&s;ceptible of. There &s;eems to be all
the rea&s;on in the world to imagine that it may
be carried to the greate&s;t degree of exactne&s;s.
If, in examining &s;everal phaenomena, we find
that they re&s;olve them&s;elves into one common
principle, and can trace this principle into
another, we &s;hall at la&s;t arrive at tho&s;e few
&s;imple principles, on which all the re&s;t de|pend.
And tho' we can never arrive at the
ultimate principles, 'tis a &s;atisfaction to go as
far as our faculties will allow us.</P>
<P>THIS &s;eems to have been the aim of our
late philo&s;ophers, and, among the re&s;t, of
this author. He propo&s;es to anatomize hu|man
nature in a regular manner, and promi|&s;es
to draw no conclu&s;ions but where he is
authorized by experience. He talks with
contempt of hypothe&s;es; and in&s;inuates, that
<PB N="7" REF="6">
&s;uch of our countrymen as have bani&s;hed
them from moral philo&s;ophy, have done a
more &s;ignal &s;ervice to the world, than <HI>my
Lord Bacon,</HI> whom he con&s;iders as the father
of experimental phy&s;icks. He mentions, on
this occa&s;ion, <HI>Mr. Locke, my Lord Shaft&s;|bury,
Dr. Mandeville, Mr. Hutchi&s;on, Dr.
Butler,</HI> who, tho' they differ in many points
among them&s;elves, &s;eem all to agree in found|ing
their accurate di&s;qui&s;itions of human na|ture
intirely upon experience.</P>
<P>BESIDE the &s;atisfaction of being acquaint|ed
with what mo&s;t nearly concerns us, it
may be &s;afely affirmed, that almo&s;t all the
&s;ciences are comprehended in the &s;cience of
human nature, and are dependent on it. <HI>The
&s;ole end of</HI> logic <HI>is to explain the principles and
Operations of our rea&s;oning faculty, and the
nature of our ideas;</HI> morals and critici&s;m <HI>re|gard
our ta&s;tes and &s;entiments; and</HI> politics
<HI>con&s;ider men as united in &s;ociety, and dependent
on each other.</HI> This treati&s;e therefore of hu|man
nature &s;eems intended for a &s;y&s;tem of the
&s;ciences. The author has fini&s;hed what re|gard
logic, and has laid the foundation of the
other parts in his account of the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE celebrated <HI>Mon&s;ieur Leibnitz</HI> has ob|&s;erved
it to be a defect in the common &s;y|&s;tems
of logic, that they are very copious
<PB N="8" REF="7">
when they explain the operations of the un|der&s;tanding
in the forming of demon&s;tra|tions,
but are too conci&s;e when they treat of
probabilities, and tho&s;e other mea&s;ures of evi|dence
on which life and action intirely de|pend,
and which are our guides even in mo&s;t
of our philo&s;ophical &s;peculations. In this
cen&s;ure, he comprehends <HI>the e&s;&s;ay on human
under&s;tanding, le recherche de la verit&eacute;,</HI> and
<HI>l'art de pen&s;er.</HI> The author of the <HI>treati&s;e of
human nature</HI> &s;eems to have been &s;en&s;ible of
this defect in the&s;e philo&s;ophers, and has en|deavoured,
as much as he can, to &s;upply it.
As his book contains a great number of &s;pe|culations
very new and remarkable, it will be
impo&s;&s;ible to give the reader a ju&s;t notion of
the whole. We &s;hall therefore chiefly con|fine
our&s;elves to his explication of our rea&s;on|ings
from cau&s;e and effect. If we can make
this intelligible to the reader, it may &s;erve as
a &s;pecimen of the whole.</P>
<P>OUR author begins with &s;ome definitions.
He calls a <HI>perception</HI> whatever can be pre&s;ent
to the mind, whether we employ our &s;en&s;es,
or are actuated with pa&s;&s;ion, or exerci&s;e our
thought and reflection. He divides our per|ceptions
into two kinds, <HI>viz. impre&s;&s;ions</HI> and
<HI>ideas.</HI> When we feel a pa&s;&s;ion or emotion
of any kind, or have the images of exter|nal
<PB N="9" REF="8">
objects conveyed by our &s;en&s;es; the per|ception
of the mind is what he calls an <HI>im|pre&s;&s;ion,</HI>
which is a word that he employs in
a new &s;en&s;e. When we reflect on a pa&s;&s;ion
or an object which is not pre&s;ent, this per|ception
is an <HI>idea. Impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> therefore, are
our lively and &s;trong perceptions; <HI>ideas</HI> are
the fainter and weaker. This di&s;tinction is
evident; as evident as that betwixt feeling
and thinking.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t propo&s;ition he advances, is, that
all our ideas, or weak perceptions, are de|rived
from our impre&s;&s;ions, or &s;trong percep|tions,
and that we can never think of any
thing which we have not &s;een without us,
or felt in our own minds. This propo&s;ition
&s;eems to be equivalent to that which Mr.
<HI>Locke</HI> has taken &s;uch pains to e&s;tabli&s;h, <HI>viz.
that no ideas are innate.</HI> Only it may be ob|&s;erved,
as an inaccuracy of that famous phi|lo&s;opher,
that he comprehends all our per|ceptions
under the term of idea, in which
&s;en&s;e it is fal&s;e, that we have no innate ideas.
For it is evident our &s;tronger perceptions or
impre&s;&s;ions are innate, and that natural af|fection,
love of virtue, re&s;entment, and all
the other pa&s;&s;ions, ari&s;e immediately from na|ture.
I am per&s;waded, whoever would take
the que&s;tion in this light, would be ea&s;ily a|ble
<PB N="10" REF="9">
to reconcile all parties. <HI>Father Male|branche</HI>
would find him&s;elf at a lo&s;s to point
out any thought of the mind, which did not
repre&s;ent &s;omething antecedently felt by it,
either internally, or by means of the external
&s;en&s;es, and mu&s;t allow, that however we
may compound, and mix, and augment, and
dimini&s;h our ideas, they are all derived from
the&s;e &s;ources. <HI>Mr. Locke,</HI> on the other
hand, would readily acknowledge, that all
our pa&s;&s;ions are a kind of natural in&s;tincts, de|rived
from nothing but the original con&s;titu|tion
of the human mind.</P>
<P>OUR author thinks, <Q REND="inline">"that no di&s;covery
could have been made more happily for de|ciding
all controver&s;ies concerning ideas than
this, that impre&s;&s;ions always take the pre|cedency
of them, and that every idea with
which the imagination is furni&s;hed, fir&s;t
makes its appearance in a corre&s;pondent
impre&s;&s;ion. The&s;e latter perceptions are
all &s;o clear and evident, that they admit
of no controver&s;y; tho' many of our ide|as
are &s;o ob&s;cure, that 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;i|ble
even for the mind, which forms them,
to tell exactly their nature and compo&s;i|tion."</Q>
Accordingly, wherever any idea
is ambiguous, he has always recour&s;e to
the impre&s;&s;ion, which mu&s;t render it clear
<PB N="11" REF="10">
and preci&s;e. And when he &s;u&s;pects that any
philo&s;ophical term has no idea annexed to it
(as is too common) he always a&s;ks <HI>from what
impre&s;&s;ion that idea is derived?</HI> And if no im|pre&s;&s;ion
can be produced, he concludes that
the term is altogether in&s;ignificant. 'Tis after
this manner he examines our idea of <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI>
and <HI>e&s;&s;ence;</HI> and it were to be wi&s;hed, that
this rigorous method were more practi&s;ed in
all philo&s;ophical debates.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that all rea&s;onings concerning
<HI>matter of fact</HI> are founded on the relation of
cau&s;e and effect, and that we can never infer
the exi&s;tence of one object from another,
unle&s;s they be connected together, either
mediately or immediately. In order there|fore
to under&s;tand the&s;e rea&s;onings, we mu&s;t
be perfectly acquainted with the idea of a
cau&s;e; and in order to that, mu&s;t look about
us to find &s;omething that is the cau&s;e of a|nother.</P>
<P>HERE is a billiard-ball lying on the ta|ble,
and another ball moving towards it with
rapidity. They &s;trike; and the ball, which
was formerly at re&s;t, now acquires a mo|tion.
This is as perfect an in&s;tance of the
relation of cau&s;e and effect as any which we
know, either by &s;en&s;ation or reflection. Let
us therefore examine it. 'Tis evident, that
<PB N="12" REF="11">
the two balls touched one another before
the motion was communicated, and that
there was no interval betwixt the &s;hock and
the motion. <HI>Contiguity</HI> in time and place is
therefore a requi&s;ite circum&s;tance to the ope|ration
of all cau&s;es. 'Tis evident likewi&s;e,
that the motion, which was the cau&s;e, is
prior to the motion, which was the effect.
<HI>Priority</HI> in time, is therefore another requi|&s;ite
circum&s;tance in every cau&s;e. But this is
not all. Let us try any other balls of the
&s;ame kind in a like &s;ituation, and we &s;hall al|ways
find, that the impul&s;e of the one pro|duces
motion in the other. Here therefore
is a <HI>third</HI> circum&s;tance, <HI>viz.</HI> that of a <HI>con|&s;tant
conjunction</HI> betwixt the cau&s;e and effect.
Every object like the cau&s;e, produces always
&s;ome object like the effect. Beyond the&s;e
three circum&s;tances of contiguity, priority,
and con&s;tant conjunction, I can di&s;cover no|thing
in this cau&s;e. The fir&s;t ball is in mo|tion;
touches the &s;econd; immediately the
&s;econd is in motion: and when I try the ex|periment
with the &s;ame or like balls, in the
&s;ame or like circum&s;tances, I find, that up|on
the motion and touch of the one ball,
motion always follows in the other. In what|ever
&s;hape I turn this matter, and however I
examine it, I can find nothing farther.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
THIS is the ca&s;e when both the cau&s;e and
effect are pre&s;ent to the &s;en&s;es. Let us now
&s;ee upon what our inference is founded, when
we conclude from the one that the other has
exi&s;ted or will exi&s;t. Suppo&s;e I &s;ee a ball
moving in a &s;treight line towards another, I
immediately conclude, that they will &s;hock,
and that the &s;econd will be in motion. This
is the inference from cau&s;e to effect; and of
this nature are all our rea&s;onings in the con|duct
of life: on his is founded all our belief
in hi&s;tory: and from hence is derived all phi|lo&s;ophy,
excepting only geometry and arith|metic.
If we can explain the inference from
the &s;hock of two balls, we &s;hall be able to
account for this operation of the mind in all
in&s;tances.</P>
<P>WERE a man, &s;uch as <HI>Adam,</HI> created in the
full vigour of under&s;tanding, without expe|rience,
he would never be able to infer mo|tion
in the &s;econd ball from the motion and
impul&s;e of the fir&s;t. It is not any thing that
rea&s;on &s;ees in the cau&s;e, which make us <HI>infer</HI>
the effect. Such an inference, were it po&s;&s;i|ble,
would amount to a demon&s;tration, as
being founded merely on the compari&s;on of
ideas. But no inference from cau&s;e to effect
amounts to a demon&s;tration. Of which there
is this evident proof. The mind can always
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<HI>conceive</HI> any effect to follow from any cau&s;e,
and indeed any event to follow upon another:
whatever we <HI>conceive</HI> is po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t in a
metaphy&s;ical &s;en&s;e: but wherever a demon|&s;tration
takes place, the contrary is impo&s;&s;i|ble,
and implies a contradiction. There is
no demon&s;tration, therefore, for any con|junction
of cau&s;e and effect. And this is a
principle, which is generally allowed by phi|lo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>IT would have been nece&s;&s;ary, therefore,
for <HI>Adam</HI> (if he was not in&s;pired) to have
had <HI>experience</HI> of the effect, which followed
upon the impul&s;e of the&s;e two balls. He
mu&s;t have &s;een, in &s;everal in&s;tances, that
when the one ball &s;truck upon the other, the
&s;econd always acquired motion. If he had
&s;een a &s;ufficient number of in&s;tances of this
kind, whenever he &s;aw the one ball moving
towards the other, he would always conclude
without he&s;itation, that the &s;econd would
acquire motion. His under&s;tanding would
anticipate his &s;ight, and form a conclu&s;ion
&s;uitable to his pa&s;t experience.</P>
<P>IT follows, then, that all rea&s;onings con|cerning
cau&s;e and effect, are founded on ex|perience,
and that all rea&s;onings from expe|rience
are founded on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that
the cour&s;e of nature will continue uniformly
<PB N="15" REF="14">
the &s;ame. We conclude, that like cau&s;es,
in like circum&s;tances, will always produce
like effects. It may now be worth while to
con&s;ider, what determines us to form a con|clu&s;ion
of &s;uch infinite con&s;equence.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that <HI>Adam</HI> with all his &s;ci|ence,
would never have been able to <HI>demon|&s;trate,</HI>
that the cour&s;e of nature mu&s;t con|tinue
uniformly the &s;ame, and that the future
mu&s;t be conformable to the pa&s;t. What is
po&s;&s;ible can never be demon&s;trated to be fal&s;e;
and 'tis po&s;&s;ible the cour&s;e of nature may
change, &s;ince we can conceive &s;uch a change.
Nay, I will go farther, and a&s;&s;ert, that he
could not &s;o much as prove by any <HI>probable</HI>
arguments, that the future mu&s;t be conform|able
to the pa&s;t. All probable arguments are
built on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that there is this
conformity betwixt the future and the pa&s;t,
and therefore can never prove it. This con|formity
is a <HI>matter of fact,</HI> and if it mu&s;t
be proved, will admit of no proof but from
experience. But our experience in the pa&s;t
can be a proof of nothing for the future, but
upon a &s;uppo&s;ition, that there is a re&s;emblance
betwixt them. This therefore is a point,
which can admit of no proof at all, and which
we take for granted without any proof.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
WE are determined by CUSTOM alone to
&s;uppo&s;e the future conformable to the pa&s;t.
When I &s;ee a billiard-ball moving towards
another, my mind is immediately carry'd by
habit to the u&s;ual effect, and anticipates my
&s;ight by conceiving the &s;econd ball in motion.
There is nothing in the&s;e objects, ab&s;tractly
con&s;idered, and independent of experience,
which leads me to form any &s;uch conclu&s;ion:
and even after I have had experience of many
repeated effects of this kind, there is no argu|ment,
which determines me to &s;uppo&s;e, that
the effect will be conformable to pa&s;t expe|rience.
The powers, by which bodies ope|rate,
are entirely unknown. We perceive
only their &s;en&s;ible qualities: and what <HI>rea&s;on</HI>
have we to think, that the &s;ame powers will
always be conjoined with the &s;ame &s;en&s;ible
qualities?</P>
<P>'TIS not, therefore, rea&s;on, which is the
guide of life, but cu&s;tom. That alone de|termines
the mind, in all in&s;tances, to &s;uppo&s;e
the future conformable to the pa&s;t. How|ever
ea&s;y this &s;tep may &s;eem, rea&s;on would
never, to all eternity, be able to make it.</P>
<P>THIS is a very curious di&s;covery, but leads
us to others, that are &s;till more curious. <HI>When
I &s;ee a billiard ball moving towards another, my
mind is immediately carried by habit to the u&s;ual</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
<HI>and anticipate my &s;ight by conceiving the &s;econd
ball in motion.</HI> But is this all? Do I nothing
but CONCEIVE the motion of the &s;econd ball?
No &s;urely. I al&s;o BELIEVE that it will move.
What then is this <HI>belief?</HI> And how does it
differ from the &s;imple conception of any
thing? Here is a new que&s;tion unthought of
by philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>When a demon&s;tration convinces me of
any propo&s;ition, it not only makes me con|ceive
the propo&s;ition, but al&s;o makes me
&s;en&s;ible, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to conceive any
thing contrary. What is demon&s;tratively fal&s;e
implies a contradiction; and what implies a
contradiction cannot be conceived. But with
regard to any matter of fact, however &s;trong
the proof may be from experience, I can al|ways
conceive the contrary, tho' I cannot al|ways
believe it. The belief, therefore, makes
&s;ome difference betwixt the conception to
which we a&s;&s;ent, and that to which we do
not a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>To account for this, there are only two
hypothe&s;es. It may be &s;aid, that belief joins
&s;ome new idea to tho&s;e which we may con|ceive
without a&s;&s;enting to them. But this
hypothe&s;is is fal&s;e. For <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> no &s;uch idea can
be produced. When we &s;imply conceive an
object, we conceive it in all its parts. We
<PB N="18" REF="17">
conceive it as it might exi&s;t, tho' we do not
believe it to exi&s;t. Our belief of it would
di&s;cover no new qualities. We may paint out
the entire object in imagination without be|lieving
it. We may &s;et it, in a manner, be|fore
our eyes, with every circum&s;tance of
time and place. 'Tis the very object conceiv|ed
as it might exi&s;t; and when we believe
it, we can do no more.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THE mind has a faculty of join|ing
all ideas together, which involve not a
contradiction; and therefore if belief con&s;i&s;t|ed
in &s;ome idea, which we add to the &s;imple
conception, it would be in a man's power,
by adding this idea to it, to believe any thing,
which he can conceive.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore belief implies a concep|tion,
and yet is &s;omething more; and &s;ince
it adds no new idea to the conception; it fol|lows,
that it is a different MANNER of con|ceiving
an object; <HI>&s;omething</HI> that is di&s;tingui&s;h|able
to the feeling, and depends not upon our
will, as all our ideas do. My mind runs by
habit from the vi&s;ible object of one ball mov|ing
towards another, to the u&s;ual effect of mo|tion
in the &s;econd ball. It not only conceives
that motion, but <HI>feels</HI> &s;omething different in
the conception of it from a mere reverie of the
imagination. The pre&s;ence of this vi&s;ible
<PB N="19" REF="18">
object, and the con&s;tant conjunction of that
particular effect, render the idea different to
the <HI>feeling</HI> from tho&s;e loo&s;e ideas, which come
into the mind without any introduction.
This conclu&s;ion &s;eems a little &s;urprizing;
but we are led into it by a chain of propo&s;i|tions,
which admit of no doubt. To ea&s;e
the reader's memory I &s;hall briefly re&s;ume
them. No matter of fact can be proved but
from its cau&s;e or its effect. Nothing can be
known to be the cau&s;e of another but by ex|perience.
We can give no rea&s;on for extend|ing
to the future our experience in the pa&s;t;
but are entirely determined by cu&s;tom, when
we conceive an effect to follow from its u&s;ual
cau&s;e. But we al&s;o believe an effect to fol|low,
as well as conceive it. This belief joins
no new idea to the conception. It only
varies the manner of conceiving, and makes
a difference to the feeling or &s;entiment. Be|lief,
therefore, in all matters of fact ari&s;es
only from cu&s;tom, and is an idea conceived
in a peculiar <HI>manner.</HI></P>
<P>OUR author proceeds to explain the man|ner
or feeling, which renders belief different
from a loo&s;e conception. He &s;eems &s;en&s;ible,
that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible by words to de&s;cribe this
feeling, which every one mu&s;t be con&s;cious
of in his own brea&s;t. He calls it &s;ometimes
<PB N="20" REF="19">
a <HI>&s;tronger</HI> conception, &s;ometimes a more <HI>lively,</HI>
a more <HI>vivid,</HI> a <HI>firmer,</HI> or a more <HI>inten&s;e</HI> con|ception.
And indeed, whatever name we
may give to this feeling, which con&s;titutes
belief, our author thinks it evident, that it
has a more forcible effect on the mind than
fiction and mere conception. This he proves
by its influence on the pa&s;&s;ions and on the
imagination; which are only moved by truth
or what is taken for &s;uch. Poetry, with all
its art, can never cau&s;e a pa&s;&s;ion, like one in
real life. It fails in the original conception
of its objects, which never <HI>feel</HI> in the &s;ame
manner as tho&s;e which command our belief
and opinion.</P>
<P>OUR author pre&s;uming, that he had &s;uffi|ciently
proved, that the ideas we a&s;&s;ent to are
different to the feeling from the other ideas,
and that this feeling is more firm and lively
than our common conception, endeavours in
the next place to explain the cau&s;e of this
lively feeling by an analogy with other acts of
the mind. His rea&s;oning &s;eems to be curious;
but could &s;carce be rendered intelligible, or at
lea&s;t probable to the reader, without a long
detail, which would exceed the compa&s;s I
have pre&s;cribed to my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">
I have likewi&s;e omitted many arguments,
which he adduces to prove that belief con|&s;i&s;ts
merely in a peculiar feeling or &s;entiment.
I &s;hall only mention one; our pa&s;t experience
is not always uniform. Sometimes one ef|fect
follows from a cau&s;e, &s;ometimes ano|ther:
In which ca&s;e we always believe, that
that will exi&s;t which is mo&s;t common. I
&s;ee a billiard-ball moving towards another.
I cannot di&s;tingui&s;h whether it moves upon
its axis, or was &s;truck &s;o as to skim along the
table. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, I know it will not
&s;top after the &s;hock. In the &s;econd it may
&s;top. The fir&s;t is mo&s;t common, and there|fore
I lay my account with that effect. But
I al&s;o conceive the other effect, and conceive
it as po&s;&s;ible, and as connected with the
cau&s;e. Were not the one conception diffe|rent
in the feeling or &s;entiment from the o|ther,
there would be no difference betwixt
them.</P>
<P>WE have confin'd our&s;elves in this whole
rea&s;oning to the relation of cau&s;e and effect,
as di&s;covered in the motions and operations of
matter. But the &s;ame rea&s;oning extends to
the operations of the mind. Whether we
con&s;ider the influence of the will in moving
our body, or in governing our thought, it
may &s;afely be affirmed, that we could never
<PB N="22" REF="21">
foretel the effect, merely from the con&s;idera|tion
of the cau&s;e, without experience. And
even after we have experience of the&s;e effects,
'tis cu&s;tom alone, not rea&s;on, which deter|mines
us to make it the &s;tandard of our fu|ture
judgments. When the cau&s;e is pre|&s;ented,
the mind, from habit, immediately
pa&s;&s;es to the conception and belief of the u&s;ual
effect. This belief is &s;omething different
from the conception. It does not, however,
join any new idea to it. It only makes it be
felt differently, and renders it &s;tronger and
more lively.</P>
<P>HAVING di&s;patcht this material point con|cerning
the nature of the inference from
cau&s;e and effect, our author returns upon
his foot&s;teps, and examines anew the idea of
that relation. In the con&s;idering of motion
communicated from one ball to another, we
could find nothing but contiguity, priority in
the cau&s;e, and con&s;tant conjunction. But,
be&s;ide the&s;e circum&s;tances, 'tis commonly
&s;uppos'd, that there is a nece&s;&s;ary connexion
betwixt the cau&s;e and effect, and that the
cau&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;omething, which we call a
<HI>power,</HI> or <HI>force,</HI> or <HI>energy.</HI> The que&s;tion is,
what idea is annex'd to the&s;e terms? If all
our ideas or thoughts be derived from our
impre&s;&s;ions, this power mu&s;t either di&s;cover
<PB N="23" REF="22">
it&s;elf to our &s;en&s;es, or to our internal feeling.
But &s;o little does any <HI>power</HI> di&s;cover it&s;elf to
the &s;en&s;es in the operations of matter, that
the <HI>Carte&s;ians</HI> have made no &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ert,
that matter is utterly deprived of energy, and
that all its operations are perform'd merely
by the energy of the &s;upreme Being. But the
que&s;tion &s;till recurs, <HI>What idea have we of
energy or power even in the &s;upreme Being?</HI>
All our idea of a Deity (according to tho&s;e
who deny innate ideas) is nothing but a com|po&s;ition
of tho&s;e ideas, which we acquire from
reflecting on the operations of our own minds.
Now our own minds afford us no more notion
of energy than matter does. When we con&s;ider
our will or volition a <HI>priori,</HI> ab&s;tracting from
experience, we &s;hould never be able to infer
any effect from it. And when we take the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of experience, it only &s;hows us ob|jects
contiguous, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive, and con&s;tantly
conjoined. Upon the whole, then, either
we have no idea at all of force and energy,
and the&s;e words are altogether in&s;ignificant,
or they can mean nothing but that determi|nation
of the thought, acquir'd by habit, to
pa&s;s from the cau&s;e to its u&s;ual effect. But
who-ever would thoroughly under&s;tand this
mu&s;t con&s;ult the author him&s;elf. 'Tis &s;uffi|cient,
if I can make the learned world ap|prehend,
<PB N="24" REF="23">
that there is &s;ome difficulty in the
ca&s;e, and that who-ever &s;olves the difficulty
mu&s;t &s;ay &s;ome thing very new and extraordi|nary;
as new as the difficulty it&s;elf.</P>
<P>BY all that has been &s;aid the reader
will ea&s;ily perceive, that the philo&s;ophy con|tain'd
in this book is very &s;ceptical, and tends
to give us a notion of the imperfections and
narrow limits of human under&s;tanding. Al|mo&s;t
all rea&s;oning is there reduced to experi|ence;
and the belief, which attends experi|ence,
is explained to be nothing but a peculiar
&s;entiment, or lively conception produced by
habit. Nor is this all, when we believe any
thing of <HI>external</HI> exi&s;tence, or &s;uppo&s;e an ob|ject
to exi&s;t a moment after it is no longer
perceived, this belief is nothing but a &s;enti|ment
of the &s;ame kind. Our author in|&s;i&s;ts
upon &s;everal other &s;ceptical topics; and
upon the whole concludes, that we a&s;&s;ent to
our faculties, and employ our rea&s;on only
becau&s;e we cannot help it. Philo&s;ophy wou'd
render us entirely <HI>Pyrrhonian,</HI> were not nature
too &s;trong for it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the logics of this author
with an account of two opinions, which &s;eem
to be peculiar to him&s;elf, as indeed are mo&s;t
of his opinions. He a&s;&s;erts, that the &s;oul,
as far as we can conceive it, is nothing but a
<PB N="25" REF="24">
&s;y&s;tem or train of different perceptions, tho&s;e
of heat and cold, love and anger, thoughts
and &s;en&s;ations; all united together, but with|out
any perfect &s;implicity or identity. <HI>Des
Cartes</HI> maintained that thought was the e&s;|&s;ence
of the mind; not this thought or that
thought, but thought in general. This &s;eems to
be ab&s;olutely unintelligible, &s;ince every thing,
that exi&s;ts, is particular: And therefore it
mu&s;t be our &s;everal particular perceptions,
that compo&s;e the mind. I &s;ay, <HI>compo&s;e</HI> the
mind, not <HI>belong</HI> to it. The mind is not a
&s;ub&s;tance, in which the perceptions inhere.
That notion is as unintelligible as the <HI>Carte|&s;ian,</HI>
that thought or perception in general is
the e&s;&s;ence of the mind. We have no idea
of &s;ub&s;tance of any kind, &s;ince we have no
idea but what is derived from &s;ome impre&s;&s;i|on,
and we have no impre&s;&s;ion of any &s;ub|&s;tance
either material or &s;piritual. We know
nothing but particular qualities and percepti|ons.
As our idea of any body, a peach, for
in&s;tance, is only that of a particular ta&s;te, co|lour,
figure, &s;ize, con&s;i&s;tence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So our
idea of any mind is only that of particular
perceptions, without the notion of any thing
we call &s;ub&s;tance, either &s;imple or compound.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd principle, which I propo&s;ed
to take notice of, is with regard to Geome|try.
<PB N="26" REF="25">
Having denied the infinite divi&s;ibility of
exten&s;ion, our author finds him&s;elf obliged to
refute tho&s;e mathematical arguments, which
have been adduced for it; and the&s;e indeed
are the only ones of any weight. This he
does by denying Geometry to be a &s;cience ex|act
enough to admit of conclu&s;ions &s;o &s;ubtile
as tho&s;e which regard infinite divi&s;ibility.
His arguments may be thus explained. All
Geometry is founded on the notions of equa|lity
and inequality, and therefore according
as we have or have not an exact &s;tandard of
that relation, the &s;cience it&s;elf will or will
not admit of great exactne&s;s. Now there is
an exact &s;tandard of equality, if we &s;uppo&s;e
that quantity is compo&s;ed of indivi&s;ible points.
Two lines are equal when the numbers of
the points, that compo&s;e them, are equal,
and when there is a point in one corre&s;pond|ing
to a point in the other. But tho' this
&s;tandard be exact, 'tis u&s;ele&s;s; &s;ince we can
never compute the number of points in any
line. It is be&s;ides founded on the &s;uppo|&s;ition
of finite divi&s;ibility, and therefore can
never afford any conclu&s;ion again&s;t it. If we
reject this &s;tandard of equality, we have
none that has any preten&s;ions to exactne&s;s. I
find two that are commonly made u&s;e of.
Two lines above a yard, for in&s;tance, are
<PB N="27" REF="26">
&s;aid to be equal, when they contain any infe|rior
quantity, as an inch, an equal number
of times. But this runs in a circle. For
the quantity we call an inch in the one is &s;up|po&s;ed
to be <HI>equal</HI> to what we call an inch in
the other: And the que&s;tion &s;till is, by what
&s;tandard we proceed when we judge
them to be equal; or, in other words, what
we mean when we &s;ay they are equal. If
we take &s;till inferior quantities, we go on <HI>in
infinitum.</HI> This therefore is no &s;tandard of
equality. The greate&s;t part of philo&s;ophers,
when ask'd what they mean by equality,
&s;ay, that the word admits of no definition,
and that it is &s;ufficient to place before us two
equal bodies, &s;uch as two diameters of a cir|cle,
to make us under&s;tand that term. Now
this is taking the <HI>general appearance</HI> of the ob|jects
for the &s;tandard of that proportion, and
renders our imagination and &s;en&s;es the ulti|mate
judges of it. But &s;uch a &s;tandard ad|mits
of no exactne&s;s, and can never afford
any conclu&s;ion contrary to the imagination
and &s;en&s;es. Whether this que&s;tion be ju&s;t or
not, mu&s;t be left to the learned world to
judge. 'Twere certainly to be wi&s;h'd, that
&s;ome expedient were fallen upon to reconcile
philo&s;ophy and common &s;en&s;e, which with re|gard
to the que&s;tion of infinite divi&s;ibility
<PB N="28" REF="27">
have wag'd mo&s;t cruel wars with each o|ther.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t now proceed to give &s;ome ac|count
of the &s;econd volume of this work,
which treats of the PASSIONS. 'Tis of more
ea&s;y comprehen&s;ion than the fir&s;t; but con|tains
opinions, that are altogether as new and
extraordinary. The author begins with <HI>Pride</HI>
and <HI>humility.</HI> He ob&s;erves, that the objects
which excite the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, are very nume|rous,
and &s;eemingly very different from each
other. Pride or &s;elf-e&s;teem may ari&s;e from
the qualities of the mind; wit, good-&s;en&s;e,
learning, courage, integrity: from tho&s;e of
the body; beauty, &s;trength, agility, good
mein, addre&s;s in dancing, riding, fencing:
from external advantages; country, family,
children, relations, riches, hou&s;es, gardens,
hor&s;es, dogs, cloaths. He afterwards pro|ceeds
to find out that common circum&s;tance,
in which all the&s;e objects agree, and which
cau&s;es them to operate on the pa&s;&s;ions. His
theory likewi&s;e extends to love and hatred,
and other affections. As the&s;e que&s;tions, tho'
curious, could not be rendered intelligible
without a long di&s;cour&s;e, we &s;hall here omit
them.</P>
<P>IT may perhaps be more acceptable to
the reader to be informed of what our author
<PB N="29" REF="28">
&s;ays concerning <HI>free-will.</HI> He has laid the
foundation of his doctrine in what he &s;aid
concerning cau&s;e and effect, as above explain|ed.
<Q REND="inline">" 'Tis univer&s;ally acknowledged, that
the operations of external bodies are nece&s;|&s;ary,
and that in the communication of
their motion, in their attraction and mutual
cohe&s;ion, there are not the lea&s;t traces of
indifference or liberty."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Whatever
therefore is in this re&s;pect on the &s;ame
footing with matter, mu&s;t be acknowledged
to be nece&s;&s;ary. That we may know
whether this be the ca&s;e with the actions of
the mind, we may examine matter, and
con&s;ider on what the idea of a nece&s;&s;ity
in its operations are founded, and why we
conclude one body or action to be the in|fallible
cau&s;e of another."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It has been ob&s;erved already, that in no
&s;ingle in&s;tance the ultimate connexion of
any object is di&s;coverable either by our
&s;en&s;es or rea&s;on, and that we can never pe|netrate
&s;o far into the e&s;&s;ence and con&s;truc|tion
of bodies, as to perceive the principle
on which their mutual influence is found|ed.
'Tis their con&s;tant union alone, with
which we are acquainted; and 'tis from
the con&s;tant union the nece&s;&s;ity ari&s;es, when
the mind is determined to pa&s;s from one
<PB N="30" REF="29">
object to its u&s;ual attendant, and infer the
exi&s;tence of one from that of the other.
Here then are two particulars, which we
are to regard as e&s;&s;ential to <HI>nece&s;&s;ity, viz.</HI>
the con&s;tant <HI>union</HI> and the <HI>inference</HI> of the
mind, and wherever we di&s;cover the&s;e we
mu&s;t acknowledge a nece&s;&s;ity."</Q> Now
nothing is more evident than the con&s;tant
union of particular actions with particular
motives. If all actions be not con&s;tantly
united with their proper motives, this uncer|tainty
is no more than what may be ob&s;erved
every day in the actions of matter, where by
rea&s;on of the mixture and uncertainty of cau|&s;es,
the effect is often variable and uncertain.
Thirty grains of opium will kill any man that
is not accu&s;tomed to it; tho' thirty grains of
rhubarb will not always purge him. In like
manner the fear of death will always make
a man go twenty paces out of his road; tho'
it will not always make him do a bad action.</P>
<P>AND as there is often a con&s;tant conjunction
of the actions of the will with their motives,
&s;o the inference from the one to the other is
often as certain as any rea&s;oning concerning
bodies: and there is always an inference pro|portioned
to the con&s;tancy of the conjunction.
On this is founded our belief in witne&s;&s;es, our
credit in hi&s;tory, and indeed all kinds of mo|ral
<PB N="31" REF="30">
evidence, and almo&s;t the whole conduct of
life.</P>
<P>OUR author pretends, that this rea&s;oning
puts the whole controver&s;y in a new light, by
giving a new definition of nece&s;&s;ity. And,
indeed, the mo&s;t zealous advocates for free|will
mu&s;t allow this union and inference with
regard to human actions. They will only de|ny,
that this makes the whole of nece&s;&s;ity.
But then they mu&s;t &s;hew, that we have an
idea of &s;omething el&s;e in the actions of mat|ter;
which, according to the foregoing rea|&s;oning,
is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THRO' this whole book, there are great
preten&s;ions to new di&s;coveries in philo&s;ophy;
but if any thing can intitle the author to &s;o
glorious a name as that of an <HI>inventor,</HI> 'tis
the u&s;e he makes of the principle of the a&s;|&s;ociation
of ideas, which enters into mo&s;t of
his philo&s;ophy. Our imagination has a great
authority over our ideas; and there are no ideas
that are different from each other, which it
cannot &s;eparate, and join, and compo&s;e into
all the varieties of fiction. But notwith|&s;tanding
the empire of the imagination, there
is a &s;ecret tie or union among particular ideas,
which cau&s;es the mind to conjoin them more
frequently together, and makes the one, upon
its appearance, introduce the other. Hence
<PB N="32" REF="31">
ari&s;es what we call the <HI>apropos</HI> of di&s;cour&s;e:
hence the connection of writing: and hence
that thread, or chain of thought, which a
man naturally &s;upports even in the loo&s;e&s;t
<HI>reverie.</HI> The&s;e principles of a&s;&s;ociation are
reduced to three, <HI>viz. Re&s;emblance;</HI> a pic|ture
naturally makes us think of the man it
was drawn for. <HI>Contiguity;</HI> when <HI>St. Den|nis</HI>
is mentioned, the idea of <HI>Paris</HI> naturally
occurs. <HI>Cau&s;ation;</HI> when we think of the
&s;on, we are apt to carry our attention to the
father. 'Twill be ea&s;y to conceive of what
va&s;t con&s;equence the&s;e principles mu&s;t be in
the &s;cience of human nature, if we con&s;ider,
that &s;o far as regards the mind, the&s;e are the
only links that bind the parts of the univer&s;e
together, or connect us with any per&s;on or
object exterior to our&s;elves. For as it is by
means of thought only that any thing ope|rates
upon our pa&s;&s;ions, and as the&s;e are the
only ties of our thoughts, they are really <HI>to
us</HI> the cement of the univer&s;e, and all the
operations of the mind mu&s;t, in a great mea|&s;ure,
depend on them.</P>
