<P>_THERE is Nothing in Nature more irk&s;ome than general Di&s;cour&s;es, e&s;|pecially when they turn chiefly upon Words. For this Rea&s;on I &s;hall wave the Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of that Point which was &s;tarted &s;ome Years &s;ince, Whether <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> may be called an <HI>Heroic Poem?</HI> Tho&s;e who will not give it that Title, may call it (if they plea&s;e) a <HI>Divine Poem.</HI> It will be &s;ufficient to its Perfection, if it has in it all the Beauties of the highe&s;t Kind of Poetry; and as for tho&s;e who alledge it is not an Heroick Poem,
<PB N="4" REF="3">
they advance no more to the Diminution of it, than if they &s;hould &s;ay <HI>Adam</HI> is not <HI>Aeneas,</HI> nor <HI>Eve Helen.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore examine it by the Rules of Epic Poetry, and &s;ee whether it falls &s;hort of the <HI>Iliad</HI> or <HI>Aeneid,</HI> in the Beauties which are e&s;&s;ential to that Kind of Writing. The fir&s;t Thing to be con&s;ider'd in an Epic Poem, is the Fable, which is perfect or imperfect, according as the Action which it relates is more or le&s;s &s;o. This Action &s;hould have three Qualifications in it. Fir&s;t, It &s;hould be but One Action. Secondly, It &s;hould be an Entire Action; and Thirdly, It &s;hould be a Great Action. To con&s;ider the Action of the <HI>Iliad, Aeneid,</HI> and <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> in the&s;e three &s;everal Lights. <HI>Homer</HI> to pre&s;erve the Unity of his Action ha&s;tens into the Mid&s;t of Things, as <HI>Horace</HI> has ob&s;erved: Had he gone up to <HI>Leda</HI>'s Egg, or be|gun much later, even at the Rape of <HI>Helen,</HI> or the Inve&s;ting of <HI>Troy,</HI> it is manife&s;t that the Story of the Poem would have been a Series of Several Actions. He therefore opens his Poem with the Di&s;cord of his Princes, and artfully inter|weaves, in the &s;everal &s;ucceeding Parts of it, an Account of every Thing material which relates to them, and had pa&s;&s;ed before this fatal Di&s;&s;en&s;ion. After the &s;ame Manner, <HI>Aeneas</HI> makes his fir&s;t Ap|pearance in the <HI>Tyrrhene</HI> Seas, and within Sight of <HI>Italy,</HI> becau&s;e the Action propo&s;ed to be celebrated was that of his &s;ettling him&s;elf in <HI>Latium.</HI> But be|cau&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary for the Reader to know what had happened to him in the taking of <HI>Troy,</HI> and in the preceding Parts of his Voyage, <HI>Virgil</HI> makes his Heroe relate it by Way of Epi&s;ode in the &s;e|cond and third Books of the <HI>Aeneid:</HI> the Con|tents of both which Books come before tho&s;e of the fir&s;t Book in the Thread of the Story, tho' for pre&s;erving of this Unity of Action, they follow
<PB N="5" REF="4">
it in the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Poem. <HI>Milton,</HI> in Imitation of the&s;e two great Poets, opens his <HI>Pa|radi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> with an infernal Council plotting the Fall of Man, which is the Action he propo&s;ed to celebrate; and as for tho&s;e Great Actions, the Battle of the Angels, and the Creation of the World, (which preceded in Point of Time, and which, in my Opinion, would have entirely de&s;troyed the Unity of his Principal Action, had he related them in the &s;ame Order that they happened) he ca&s;t them into the fifth, &s;ixth and &s;eventh Books, by way of Epi&s;ode to this noble Poem.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. the End of <HI>Spect.</HI> 327.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>ARISTOTLE</HI> him&s;elf allows, that <HI>Homer</HI> has nothing to boa&s;t of as to the Unity of his Fable, tho' at the &s;ame Time that great Critick and Philo&s;opher endeavours to palliate this Imperfection in the <HI>Greek</HI> Poet by imputing it in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to the ve|ry Nature of an Epic Poem. Some have been of O|pinion, that the <HI>Aeneid</HI> al&s;o labours in this Parti|cular, and has Epi&s;odes which may be looked upon as Excre&s;cencies rather than as Parts of the Action. On the contrary, the Poem, which we have now un|der our Con&s;ideration, hath no other Epi&s;odes than &s;uch as naturally ari&s;e from the Subject, and yet is filled with &s;uch a Multitude of a&s;toni&s;hing Incidents, that it gives us at the &s;ame Time a Plea&s;ure of the greate&s;t Variety, and of the greate&s;t Simpli|city; uniform in its Nature, tho' diver&s;ified in the Execution.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve al&s;o, that, as <HI>Virgil</HI> in the Poem which was de&s;igned to celebrate the Original of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, has de&s;cribed the Birth of its great Rival, the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Common-wealth: <HI>Mil|ton,</HI> with the like Art in his Poem on the Fall of Man, has related the Fall of tho&s;e Angels who are his profe&s;&s;ed Enemies. Be&s;ide the many other Beauties in &s;uch an Epi&s;ode, it's running parallel
<PB N="6" REF="5">
with the great Action of the Poem, hinders it from breaking the Unity &s;o much as another Epi&s;ode would have done, that had not &s;o great an Affini|ty with the principal Subject. In &s;hort, this is the &s;ame Kind of Beauty which the Criticks admire in the <HI>Spani&s;h Fryar,</HI> or the <HI>Double Di&s;covery,</HI> where the two different Plots look like Counterparts and Copies of one another.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd Qualification required in the Action of an Epic Poem is, that it &s;hould be an <HI>entire</HI> Action: An Action is entire when it is compleat in all its Parts; or as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> de&s;cribes it, when it con&s;i&s;ts of a Beginning, a Middle, and an End. Nothing &s;hould go before it, be intermix'd with it, or follow after it, that is not related to it. As on the contrary, no &s;ingle Step &s;hould be omitted in that ju&s;t and regular Progre&s;s which it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to take from its Original to its Con&s;um|mation. Thus we &s;ee the Anger of <HI>Achilles</HI> in its Birth, its Continuance, and Effects; and <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s Settlement in <HI>Italy,</HI> carried on through all the Op|po&s;itions in his Way to it both by Sea and Land. The Action in <HI>Milton</HI> excells (I think) both the former in this Particular; we &s;ee it contrived in Hell, executed upon Earth, and puni&s;hed by Hea|ven. The Parts of it are told in the mo&s;t di&s;tinct Manner, and grow out of one another in the mo&s;t natural Order.</P>
<P>THE third Qualification of an Epic Poem is its <HI>Greatne&s;s.</HI> The Anger of <HI>Achilles</HI> was of &s;uch Con|&s;equence, that it embroiled the Kings of <HI>Greece,</HI> de|&s;troy'd the Heroes of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and engaged all the Gods in Factions. <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s Settlement in <HI>Italy</HI> produc'd the <HI>Cae&s;ars,</HI> and gave Birth to the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. <HI>Milton</HI>'s Subject was &s;till greater than either of the former; it does not determine the Fate of &s;ingle Per&s;ons or Nations, but of a whole Species. The United Powers of Hell are joined to|gether
<PB N="7" REF="6">
for the De&s;truction of Mankind, which they effected in Part, and would have completed, had not Omnipotence it &s;elf interpo&s;ed. The principal Actors are Man in his greate&s;t Perfection, and Wo|man in her highe&s;t Beauty. Their Enemies are the fallen Angels: The Me&s;&s;iah their Friend, and the Almighty their Protector. In &s;hort, every Thing that is great in the whole Circle of Being, whether within the Verge of Nature, or out of it, has a proper Part a&s;&s;igned it in this admirable Poem.</P>
<P>IN Poetry, as in Architecture, not only the Whole, but the principal Members, and every Part of them, &s;hould be Great. I will not pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that the Book of Games in the <HI>Aeueid,</HI> or that in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> are not of this Nature, nor to reprehend <HI>Vir|gil</HI>'s Simile of the Top, and many other of the &s;ame Kind in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> as liable to any Cen&s;ure in this Particular; but I think We may &s;ay, without de|rogating from tho&s;e wonderful Performances, that there is an Indi&s;putable and Unque&s;tioned Magnifi|cence in every Part of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> and indeed a much greater than could have been formed upon any Pagan Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> by the Greatne&s;s of the Action, does not only mean that it &s;hould be great in its Nature, but al&s;o in its Duration; or in other Words, That it &s;hould have a due Length in it, as well as what we properly call Greatne&s;s. The ju&s;t Mea&s;ure of this Kind of Mag|nitude, he explains by the following Similitude. An Animal, no bigger than a Mite, cannot appear perfect to the Eye, becau&s;e the Sight takes it in at once, and has only a confu&s;ed Idea of the Whole, and not a di&s;tinct Idea of all its Parts; If on the contrary you &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e an Animal of ten thou|&s;and Furlongs in Length, the Eye would be &s;o filled with a &s;ingle Part of it, that it could not give the Mind an Idea of the whole. What the&s;e Animals
<PB N="8" REF="7">
are to the Eye, a very &s;hort or a very long Action would be to the Memory. The fir&s;t would be, as it were, lo&s;t and &s;wallowed up by it, and the other difficult to be contained in it. <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> have &s;hewn their principal Art in this Particular; the Action of the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and that of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> were in them&s;elves exceeding &s;hort, but are &s;o beau|tifully extended and diver&s;ified by the Invention of <HI>Epi&s;odes,</HI> and the Machinery of Gods, with the like poetical Ornaments, that they make up an agree|able Story &s;ufficient to employ the Memory without overcharging it. <HI>Milton</HI>'s Action is enriched with &s;uch a Variety of Circum&s;tances, that I have taken as much Plea&s;ure in reading the Contents of his Books, as in the be&s;t invented Story I ever met with. It is po&s;&s;ible, that the Traditions, on which the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Aeneid</HI> were built, had more Circum&s;tances in them than the Hi&s;tory of <HI>the Fall of Man,</HI> as it is related in Scripture. Be&s;ides it was ea&s;ier for <HI>Ho|mer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> to da&s;h the Truth with Fiction, as they were in no Danger of offending the Religion of their Country by it. But as for <HI>Milton,</HI> he had not only a very few Circum&s;tances upon which to rai&s;e his Poem, but was al&s;o obliged to proceed with the greate&s;t Caution in every Thing that he added out of his own Invention. And, indeed, not|with&s;tanding all the Re&s;traints he was under, he has filled his Story with &s;o many &s;urpri&s;ing Inci|dents, which bear &s;o clo&s;e Analogy with what is delivered in Holy Writ, that it is capable of plea&s;|ing the mo&s;t delicate Reader, without giving Offence to the mo&s;t &s;crupulous.</P>
<P>THE modern Criticks have collected from &s;e|veral Hints in the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Aeneid</HI> the Space of Time, which is taken up by the Action of each of tho&s;e Poems; but as a great Part of <HI>Mil|ton</HI>'s Story was tran&s;acted in Regions that lie out of the Reach of the Sun and the Sphere of Day,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
it is impo&s;&s;ible to gratifie the Reader with &s;uch a Calculation, which indeed would be more curious than in&s;tructive; None of the Criticks, either An|tient or Modern, having laid down Rules to cir|cum&s;cribe the Action of an Epic Poem with any Determined Number of Years, Days, or Hours.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. <HI>Spect.</HI> 308.</NOTE></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING examined the Action of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> let us in the next Place con&s;ider the Actors. This is <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Method of con&s;idering; fir&s;t the Fable, and &s;econdly the Manners, or as we generally call them in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the Fable and the Characters.</P>
<P><HI>HOMER</HI> has excelled all the Heroic Poets that ever wrote, in the Multitude and Variety of his Characters. Every God that is admitted into his Poem, acts a Part which would have been &s;uitable to no other Deity. His Princes are as much di|&s;tingui&s;hed by their Manners as by their Domini|ons; and even tho&s;e among them, who&s;e Chara|cters &s;eem wholly made up of Courage, differ from one another as to the particular Kinds of Courage in which they excel. In &s;hort, there is &s;carce a Speech or Action in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> which the Reader may not a&s;cribe to the Per&s;on that &s;peaks or acts; without &s;eeing his Name at the Head of it.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9" MS="y">
<HI>HOMER</HI> does not only out-&s;hine all other Poets in the Variety, but al&s;o in the Novelty of his Characters. He has introduced among his <HI>Gre|cian</HI> Princes a Per&s;on, who had lived in three Ages of Men, and conver&s;ed with <HI>The&s;eus, Hercules, Poly|phenius,</HI> and the fir&s;t Race of Heroes. His principal Actor is the Son of a Godde&s;s, not to mention the Off-&s;pring of other Deities, who have likewi&s;e a Place in his Poem, and the venerable <HI>Trojan</HI> Prince who was the Father of &s;o many Kings and Heroes. There is in the&s;e &s;everal Characters of <HI>Homer,</HI> a certain Dignity as well as Novelty, which adapts them in a more peculiar Manner to the Nature of an heroic Poem. Tho' at the &s;ame Time, to give them the greater Variety, he has de&s;cribed a <HI>Vul|can,</HI> that is, a Buffoon among his Gods, and a <HI>Ther&s;ites</HI> among his Mortals.</P>
<P><HI>VIRGIL</HI> falls infinitely &s;hort of <HI>Homer</HI> in the Characters of his Poem, both as to their Variety and Novelty. <HI>Aeneas</HI> is indeed a perfect Character, but as for <HI>Achates,</HI> tho' he is &s;tiled the Heroe's Friend, he does nothing in the whole Poem which may de&s;erve that Title. <HI>Gyas, Mne&s;theus, Serge&s;tus,</HI> and <HI>Cloenthus,</HI> are all of them Men of the &s;ame Stamp and Character,
<Q><L>&mdash;fortemque Gyan, fortemque Cloanthum:</L><BIBL>Virg.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THERE are indeed &s;everal very natural Inci|dents in the Part of <HI>A&s;canius;</HI> as that of <HI>Dido</HI> can|not be &s;ufficiently admired. I do not &s;ee any Thing new or particular in <HI>Turnus. Pallas</HI> and <HI>Evander</HI> are remote Copies of <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Priam,</HI> as <HI>Lau&s;us</HI> and <HI>Mezentius</HI> are almo&s;t Parallels to <HI>Pallas</HI> and <HI>E|vander.</HI> The Characters of <HI>Ni&s;us</HI> and <HI>Eurialus</HI> are beautiful, but common. We mu&s;t not forget the Parts of <HI>Sinon, Camilla,</HI> and &s;ome few others, which are fine Improvements on the Greek Poet.
<PB N="11" REF="10">
In &s;hort, there is neither that Variety nor Novelty in the Per&s;ons of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> which we meet with in tho&s;e of the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P>IF we look into the Characters of <HI>Milton,</HI> we &s;hall find that he has introduced all the Variety his Fable was capable of receiving. The whole Spe|cies of Mankind was in two Per&s;ons at the Time to which the Subject of his Poem is confined. We have, however, four di&s;tinct Characters in the&s;e two Per&s;ons. We &s;ee Man and Woman in the highe&s;t Innocence and Perfection, and in the mo&s;t abject State of Guilt and Infirmity. The two la&s;t Chara|cters are, indeed, very common and obvious, but the two fir&s;t are not only more magnificent, but more new than any Characters either in <HI>Virgil</HI> or <HI>Homer,</HI> or indeed in the whole Circle of Nature.</P>
<P><HI>MILTON</HI> was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this Defect in the Subject of his Poem, and of the few Characters it would afford him, that he has brought into it two Actors of a &s;hadowy and fictitious Nature, in the Per&s;ons of Sin and Death, by which Means he has wrought into the Body of his Fable a very beauti|ful and well-invented Allegory. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Spect. 279.</NOTE>But notwith&s;tanding the Finene&s;s of this Allegory may atone for it in &s;ome Mea&s;ure; I cannot think that Per&s;ons of &s;uch a chimerical Exi&s;tence are proper Actors in an Epic Poem; becau&s;e there is not that Mea|&s;ure of Probability annexed to them, which is requi|&s;ite in Writings of this Kind, as I &s;hall &s;hew more at large hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>VIRGIL</HI> has, indeed, admitted <HI>Fame</HI> as an Actre&s;s in the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> but the Part &s;he acts is very &s;hort, and none of the mo&s;t admired Circum&s;tances in that Divine Work. We find in Mock-Heroic Poems, particularly in the <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ary</HI> and the <HI>Lu|trin,</HI> &s;everal allegorical Per&s;ons of this Nature, which are very beautiful in tho&s;e Compo&s;itions, and
<PB N="12" REF="11">
may, perhaps, be u&s;ed as an Argument, that the Authors of them were of Opinion, &s;uch Characters might have a Place in an Epic Work. For my own Part, I &s;hould be glad the Reader would think &s;o, for the Sake of the Poem I am now examining, and mu&s;t further add, that if &s;uch empty un&s;ub&s;tantial Beings may be ever made U&s;e of on this Occa&s;ion, never were any more nicely imagined, and employed in more proper Actions, than tho&s;e of which I am now &s;peaking.</P>
<P>ANOTHER principal Actor in this Poem is the great Enemy of Mankind. The Part of <HI>&V;ly&s;&s;es</HI> in <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> is very much admired by <HI>Ari|&s;totle,</HI> as perplexing that Fable with very agreeable Plots and Intricacies, not only by the many Ad|ventures in his Voyage, and the Subtilty of his Behaviour, but by the various Concealments and Di&s;coveries of his Per&s;on in &s;everal Parts of that Poem. But the crafty Being I have now mention|ed, makes a much longer Voyage than <HI>&V;ly&s;&s;es,</HI> puts in Practice many more Wiles and Stratagems, and hides him&s;elf under a greater Variety of Shapes and Appearances, all of which are &s;everally detected, to the great Delight and Surpti&s;e of the Reader.</P>
<P>WE may likewi&s;e ob&s;erve with how much Art the Poet has varied &s;everal Characters of the Per&s;ons that &s;peak in his infernal A&s;&s;embly. On the con|trary, how has he repre&s;ented the whole God|head exerting it &s;elf towards Man in its full Bene|volence under the Three-fold Di&s;tinction of a Creator, a Redeemer, and a Comforter!</P>
<P>NOR mu&s;t we omit the Per&s;on of <HI>Raphael,</HI> who, amid&s;t his Tenderne&s;s and Friend&s;hip for Man, &s;hews &s;uch a Dignity and Conde&s;cention in all his Speech and Behaviour, as are &s;uitable to a &s;uperior Nature. The Angels are indeed as much diver&s;ified in <HI>Milton,</HI> and di&s;tingui&s;hed by their proper Parts, as the Gods are in <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil.</HI> The Reader
<PB N="13" REF="12">
will find nothing a&s;cribed to <HI>&V;riel, Gabriel, Michael,</HI> or <HI>Raphael,</HI> which is not in a particular manner &s;uitable to their re&s;pective Characters.</P>
<P>THERE is another Circum&s;tance in the princi|pal Actors of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Aeneid,</HI> which give a peculiar Beauty to tho&s;e two Poems, and was there|fore contrived with very great Judgment. I mean the Authors having cho&s;en for their Heroes Per&s;ons who were &s;o nearly related to the People for whom they wrote. <HI>Achilles</HI> was a <HI>Greek,</HI> and <HI>Aeneas</HI> the remote Founder of <HI>Rome.</HI> By this Means their Countrymen (whom they principally propo&s;ed to them&s;elves for their Readers) were particularly at|tentive to all the Parts of their Story, and &s;ympa|thized with their Heroes in all their Adventures. A <HI>Roman</HI> could not but rejoice in the E&s;capes, Suc|ce&s;&s;es, and Victories of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and be grieved at any Defeats, Misfortunes, or Di&s;appointments that befel him; as a <HI>Greek</HI> mu&s;t have had the &s;ame Re|gard for <HI>Achilles.</HI> And it is plain, that each of tho&s;e Poems have lo&s;t this great Advantage, among tho&s;e Readers to whom their Heroes are as Stran|gers, or indifferent Per&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>MILTON</HI>'s Poem is admirable in this re&s;pect, &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible for any of its Readers, what|ever Nation, Country or People he may belong to, not to be related to the Per&s;ons who are the prin|cipal Actors in it; but what is &s;till infinitely more to its Advantage, the principal Actors in this Poem are not only our Progenitors, but our Repre&s;enta|tives. We have an Actual Intere&s;t in every Thing they do, and no le&s;s than our utmo&s;t Happine&s;s is concerned, and lies at Stake in all their Beha|viour.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ubjoin as a Corollary to the foregoing Remark, an admirable Ob&s;ervation out of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> which hath been very much mi&s;repre&s;ented in the Quotations of &s;ome Modern Criticks. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'If a Man
<PB N="14" REF="13">
of perfect and con&s;ummate Virtue falls into a Mis|fortune, it rai&s;es our Pity, but not our Terror, be|cau&s;e we do not fear that it may be our own Ca&s;e, who do not re&s;emble the &s;uffering Per&s;on.'</Q> But as that great Philo&s;opher adds, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'If we &s;ee a Man of Virtue, mixt with Infirmities, fall into any Misfortune, it does not only rai&s;e our Pity but our Terror; becau&s;e we are afraid that the like Misfortunes may happen to our &s;elves, who re|&s;emble the Character of the &s;uffering Per&s;on.'</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall only remark in this Place, that the fore|going Ob&s;ervation of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> tho' it may be true in other Occa&s;ions, does not hold in this; becau&s;e in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, though the Per&s;ons who fall into Misfortune are of the mo&s;t perfect and con|&s;ummate Virtue, it is not to be con&s;idered as what may po&s;&s;ibly be, but what actually is our own Ca&s;e; &s;ince we are embark'd with them on the &s;ame Bot|tom, and mu&s;t be Partakers of their Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>IN this, and &s;ome other very few In&s;tances, <HI>Ari|&s;totle</HI>'s Rules for Epic Poetry (which he had drawn from his Reflections upon <HI>Homer</HI>) cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed to &s;quare exactly with the heroic Poems which have been made &s;ince his Time; &s;ince it is evident to every impartial Judge his Rules would &s;till have been more perfect, could he have peru&s;ed the <HI>Aeneid</HI> which was made &s;ome hundred years after his Death.</P>
<P>IN my next, I &s;hall go through other Parts of <HI>Miltan</HI>'s Poem; and hope that what I &s;hall there advance, as well as what I have already written, will not only &s;erve as a Comment upon <HI>Milton,</HI> but upon <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI></P>

<P>WE have already taken a general Survey of the Fable and Characters in <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Pa|radi&s;e Lo&s;t:</HI> The Parts which remain to be con&s;i|der'd, according to <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Method, are the <HI>Sen|timents</HI> and the <HI>Language.</HI> Before I enter upon the fir&s;t of the&s;e, I mu&s;t adverti&s;e my Reader, that it is my De&s;ign as &s;oon as I have fini&s;hed my ge|neral Reflections on the&s;e four &s;everal Heads, to give particular In&s;tances out of the Poem now be|fore us of Beauties and Imperfections which may be ob&s;erved under each of them, as al&s;o of &s;uch other Particulars as may not properly fall under any of them. This I thought fit to premi&s;e, that the Rea|der may not judge too ha&s;tily of this Piece of Cri|tici&s;m, or look upon it as imperfect, before he has &s;een the whole Extent of it.</P>
<P>THE Sentiments in an Epic Poem are the Thoughts and Behaviour which the Author a&s;cribes to the Per&s;ons whom he introduces, and are <HI>ju&s;t</HI> when they are conformable to the Characters of the &s;everal Per&s;ons. The Sentiments have likewi&s;e a Relation to <HI>Things</HI> as well as <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> and are then perfect when they are &s;uch as are adapted to the Subject. If in either of the&s;e Ca&s;es the Poet endeavours to argue or explain, to magnifie or di|mini&s;h, to rai&s;e Love or Hatred, Pity or Terror, or any other Pa&s;&s;ion, we ought to con&s;ider whether the Sentiments he makes U&s;e of are proper for tho&s;e Ends. <HI>Homer</HI> is cen&s;ured by the Criticks for his
<PB N="16" REF="15" MS="y">
Defect as to this Particular in &s;everal Parts of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> tho' at the &s;ame Time tho&s;e who have treated this great Poet with Candour, have at|tributed this Defect to the Times in which he lived. It was the Fault of the Age, and not of <HI>Homer,</HI> if there wants that Delicacy in &s;ome of his Sentiments, which now appears in the Works of Men of a much inferior Genius. Be&s;ides, if there are Blemi&s;hes in any particular Thoughts, there is an infinite Beauty in the greate&s;t Part of them. In &s;hort, if there are many Poets who would not have fallen into the Meanne&s;s of &s;ome of his Sentiments, there are none who could have ri&s;en up to the Greatne&s;s of others. <HI>Virgil</HI> has excel|led all others in the Propriety of his Sentiments. <HI>Milton</HI> &s;hines likewi&s;e very much in this Particular: Nor mu&s;t me omit one Con&s;ideration which adds to his Honour and Reputation. <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> introduced Per&s;ons who&s;e Characters are commonly known among Men, and &s;uch as are to be met with either in Hi&s;tory, or in ordinary Conver&s;ation. <HI>Mil|ton</HI>'s Characters, mo&s;t of them, lie out of Nature, and were to be formed purely by his own Inven|tion. It &s;hews a greater Genius in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> to have drawn his <HI>Calyban,</HI> than this <HI>Hot&s;pur</HI> or <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar:</HI> The one was to be &s;upplied out of his own Imagination, whereas the other might have been formed upon Tradition, Hi&s;tory and Ob&s;ervation. It was much ea&s;ier therefore for <HI>Homer</HI> to find pro|per Sentiments for an A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Grecian</HI> Gene|rals, than for <HI>Milton</HI> to diver&s;ifie his infernal Coun|cil with proper Characters, and in&s;pire them with a Variety of Sentiments. The Loves of <HI>Dido</HI> and <HI>Aeneas</HI> are only Copies of what has pa&s;&s;ed between other Per&s;ons. <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> before the Fall, are a different Species from that of Mankind, who are de&s;cended from them; and none but a Poet of the mo&s;t unbounded Invention, and the mo&s;t exqu &s;ite
<PB N="17" REF="16">
Judgment, cou'd have filled their Conver&s;ation and Behaviour with &s;o many apt Circum&s;tances during their State of Innocence.</P>
<P>NOR is it &s;ufficient for an Epic Poem to be filled with &s;uch Thoughts as are <HI>natural,</HI> unle&s;s it abound al&s;o with &s;uch as are <HI>&s;ublime. Virgil</HI> in this Particular falls &s;hort of <HI>Homer.</HI> He has not indeed &s;o many Thoughts that are low and vulgar; but at the &s;ame Time has not &s;o many Thoughts that are &s;ublime and noble. The Truth of it is, <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;eldom ri&s;es into very a&s;toni&s;hing Sentiments, where he is not fired by the <HI>Iliad.</HI> He every where charms and plea&s;es us by the Force of his own Ge|nius; but &s;eldom elevates and tran&s;ports us where he does not fetch his Hints from <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>MILTON</HI>'s chief Talent, and indeed his di|&s;tingui&s;hing Excellence lies in the Sublimity of his Thoughts. There are others of the Moderns who rival him in every other Part of Poetry; but in the Greatne&s;s of his Sentiments he triumphs over all the Poets both Modern and Ancient, <HI>Homer</HI> only excepted. It is impo&s;&s;ible for the Imagination of Man  to di&s;tend it &s;elf with greater Ideas, than tho&s;e which he has laid together in his fir&s;t, &s;e|cond and &s;ixth Books. The &s;eventh, which de|&s;cribes the Creation of the World, is likewi&s;e won|derfully &s;ublime, tho' not &s;o apt to &s;tir up Emoti|on in the Mind of the Reader, nor con&s;equently &s;o perfect in the Epic Way of Writing, becau&s;e it is filled with le&s;s Action. Let the judicious Reader compare what <HI>Longinus</HI> has ob&s;erved on &s;everal Pa&s;|&s;ages in <HI>Homer,</HI> and he will find Parallels for mo&s;t of them in the <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid we may infer, that as there are two Kinds of Sentiments, the Natural and the Sublime, which are always to be pur&s;ued in an heroic Poem, there are al&s;o two Kinds of
<PB N="18" REF="17">
Thoughts which are carefully to be avoided. The fir&s;t are &s;uch as are affected and unnatural; the &s;econd &s;uch as are mean and vulgar. As for the fir&s;t Kind of Thoughts we meet with little or Nothing that is like them in <HI>Virgil:</HI> He has none of tho&s;e trifling Points and Puerilities that are &s;o often to be met with in <HI>Ovid,</HI> none of the Epigrammatick Turns of <HI>Lucan,</HI> none of tho&s;e &s;welling Sentiments which are &s;o frequently in <HI>Statius</HI> and <HI>Claudian,</HI> none of tho&s;e mixed Embelli&s;hments of <HI>Ta&s;&s;o.</HI> Every Thing is ju&s;t and natural. His Sentiments &s;hew that he had a perfect In&s;ight into humane Nature, and that he knew every Thing which was the mo&s;t proper to affect it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has in &s;ome Places, which I may hereafter take Notice of, mi&s;repre&s;ented <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Way of Thinking as to this Particular, in the Tran&s;|lation he has given us of the <HI>Aeneid.</HI> I do not re|member that <HI>Homer</HI> any where falls into the Faults abovementioned, which were indeed the fal&s;e Re|finements of later Ages. <HI>Milton,</HI> it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, has &s;ometimes erred in this Re&s;pect, as I &s;hall &s;hew more at large in another Paper; tho' con&s;idering all the Poets of the Age in which he writ, were infected with this wrong Way of Thinking, he is rather to be admired that he did not give more into it, than that he did &s;ometimes comply with the vi|cious Ta&s;te which &s;till prevails &s;o much among modern Writers.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ince &s;everal Thoughts may be natural which are low and groveling, an Epic Poet &s;hould not only avoid &s;uch Sentiments as are unnatural or affected, but al&s;o &s;uch as are mean and vulgar. <HI>Ho|mer</HI> has opened a great Field of Raillery to Men of more Delicacy than Greatne&s;s of Genius, by the Homeline&s;s of &s;ome of his Sentiments. But, as I have before &s;aid, the&s;e are rather to be imputed to the Simplicity of the Age in which he lived, to
<PB N="19" REF="18" MS="y">
which I may al&s;o add, of that which he de&s;cribed, than to any Imperfection in that Divine Poet. <HI>Zoi|lus,</HI> among the Ancients, and Mon&s;ieur <HI>Perrault,</HI> among the Moderns, pu&s;hed their Ridicule very far upon him, on Account of &s;ome &s;uch Sentiments. There is no Blemi&s;h to be ob&s;erved in <HI>Virgil,</HI> under this Head, and but a very few in <HI>Milton.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall give but one In&s;tance of this Impropriety of Thought in <HI>Homer,</HI> and at the &s;ame Time compare it with an In&s;tance of the &s;ame Nature, both in <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Milton.</HI> Sentiments which rai&s;e Laughter, can very &s;eldom be admitted with any Decency into an heroic Poem, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is to excite Pa&s;&s;ions of a much nobler Nature. <HI>Homer,</HI> however, in his Characters of <HI>Vulcan</HI> and <HI>Ther&s;ites,</HI> in his Story of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus,</HI> in his Behaviour of <HI>Irus,</HI> and in other Pa&s;&s;ages, has been ob&s;erved to have lap&s;ed into the Burle&s;que Character, and to have departed from that &s;erious Air which &s;eems e&s;&s;ential to the Magnificence of an Epic Poem. I remember but one Laugh in the whole <HI>Aeneid,</HI> which ri&s;es in the fifth Book upon <HI>Monoetes,</HI> where he is repre&s;ented as thrown overboard, and drying him&s;elf upon a Rock. But this Piece of Mirth is &s;o well timed, that the &s;evere&s;t Critick can have Nothing to &s;ay again&s;t it, for it is in the Book of Games and Diver&s;ions, where the Reader's Mind may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ufficiently relaxed for &s;uch an Entertainment. The only Piece of Plea&s;antry in <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> is where the evil Spirits are de|&s;cribed as rallying the Angels upon the Succe&s;s of their new invented Artillery. This Pa&s;&s;age I look upon to be the mo&s;t exceptionable in the whole Poem, as being nothing el&s;e but a String of Puns, and tho&s;e too very indifferent. <Q><LG>

<P>HAVING already treated of the Fable, the Characters and Sentiments in the <HI>Paradi&s;e lo&s;t,</HI> we are in the la&s;t Place to con&s;ider the <HI>Language;</HI> and
<PB N="21" REF="20">
as the learned World is very much divided upon <HI>Milton</HI> as to this Point, I hope they will excu&s;e me if I appear particular in any of my Opinions, and encline to tho&s;e who judge the mo&s;t advanta|giou&s;ly of the Author.</P>
<P>IT is requi&s;ite that the Language of an He|roic Poem &s;hould be both Per&s;picuous and Sublime. In Proportion as either of the&s;e two Qualities are wanting, the Language is imperfect. Per&s;picuity is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Qualification; in&s;o|much that a good-natur'd Reader &s;ometimes over|looks a little Slip even in the Grammer or Syntax, where it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to mi&s;take the Poet's Sen&s;e. Of this kind is that Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Milton,</HI> where|in he &s;peaks of <HI>Satan.</HI> <Q><L>&mdash;God and his Son except,</L>
<L>Created thing nought valu'd he nor &s;hunn'd.</L></Q> And that in which he de&s;cribes <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve.</HI><Q><L><HI>Adam</HI> the goodlie&s;t Man of Men &s;ince born</L>
<L>His Sons, the faire&s;t of her Daughters <HI>Eve.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>IT is plain, that in the former of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, according to the natural Syntax, the Divine Per&s;ons mentioned in the fir&s;t Line are repre&s;ented as creat|ed Beings; and that in the other, <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> are confounded with their Sons and Daughters. Such little Blemi&s;hes are the&s;e, when the Thought is great and natural, we &s;hould, with <HI>Horace,</HI> impute to a pardonable Inadvertency, or to the Weakne&s;s of Human Nature, which cannot attend to each minute Particular, and give the la&s;t fini&s;hing to every Circum&s;tance in &s;o long a Work. The An|cient Criticks therefore, who were acted by a Spirit of Candour, rather than that of Cavilling, invent|ed certain Figures of Speech, on purpo&s;e to palliate little Errors of this Nature in the Writings of tho&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="21">
Authors who had &s;o many greater Beauties to at|tone for them.</P>
<P>IF Clearne&s;s and Per&s;picuity were only to be con&s;ulted, the Poet would have nothing el&s;e to do but to cloath his Thoughts in the mo&s;t plain and natural Expre&s;&s;ions. But &s;ince it often happens that the mo&s;t obvious Phra&s;es, and tho&s;e which are u&s;ed in ordinary Conver&s;ation, become too familiar to the Ear, and contract a kind of Meanne&s;s by pa&s;|&s;ing through the Mouths of the Vulgar, a Poet &s;hould take particular Care to guard him&s;elf again&s;t Idiomatick Ways of &s;peaking. <HI>Ovid</HI> and <HI>Lucan</HI> have many Poorne&s;&s;es of Expre&s;&s;ion upon this account, as taking up with the fir&s;t Phra&s;es that offered, without putting them&s;elves to the Trouble of look|ing after &s;uch as would not only be natural, but al&s;o elevated and &s;ublime. <HI>Milton</HI> has but a few Failings in this kind, of which, however, you may meet with &s;ome In&s;tances, as in the following Pa&s;&s;ages. <Q><L>Embrio's and Idiots, Eremites and Fryars</L>
<L><HI>White, Black</HI> and <HI>Grey,</HI> with all their <HI>Trumpery,</HI></L>
<L>Here Pilgrims roam&mdash;</L></Q><Q><L>&mdash;A while Di&s;cour&s;e they hold,</L>
<L><HI>No Fear lea&s;t Dinner cool;</HI> when thus began</L>
<L>Our Author&mdash;</L></Q><Q><L>Who of all Ages to &s;ucceed, but feeling</L>
<L>The Evil on him brought by me, will cur&s;e</L>
<L>My Head, ill fare our Ance&s;tor impure,</L>
<L><HI>For this we may thank</HI> Adam&mdash;</L></Q> The great Ma&s;ters in Compo&s;ition know very well that many an elegant Phra&s;e becomes improper for a Poet or an Orator, when it has been deba&s;ed by common U&s;e. For this Rea&s;on the Works of An|cient Authors, which are written in dead Languages, have a great Advantage over tho&s;e which are writ|ten in Languages that are now &s;poken. Were there any Mean Phra&s;es or Idioms in <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Homer,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="22" MS="y">
they would not &s;hock the Ear of the mo&s;t delicate Modern Reader, &s;o much as they would have done that of an old <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Roman,</HI> becau&s;e we never hear them pronounced in our Streets, or in ordina|ry Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>IT is not therefore &s;ufficient, that the Language of an Epic Poem be Per&s;picuous, unle&s;s it be al&s;o Sublime. To this End it ought to deviate from the common Forms and ordinary Phra&s;es of Speech. The Judgment of a Poet very much di&s;covers it &s;elf in &s;hunning the common Roads of Expre&s;&s;ion, without falling into &s;uch ways of Speech as may &s;eem &s;tiff and unnatural; he mu&s;t not &s;well into a fal&s;e Sublime, by endeavouring to avoid the other Ex|tream. Among the <HI>Greeks, Ae&s;chylus,</HI> and &s;ome times <HI>Sophocles</HI> were guilty of this Fault; among the <HI>Latins, Claudian</HI> and <HI>Statius;</HI> and among our own Countrymen, <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> and <HI>Lee.</HI> In the&s;e Authors the Affectation of Greatne&s;s often hurts the Per|&s;picuity of the Stile, as in many others the Endea|vour after Per&s;picuity prejudices its Greatne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>ARISTOTLE</HI> has ob&s;erved, that the Idioma|tick Stile may be avoided, and the Sublime formed, by the following Methods. Fir&s;t, by the U&s;e of Metaphors: &s;uch are tho&s;e in <HI>Milton.</HI> <Q><L><HI>Imparadi&s;ed</HI> in anothers Arms,</L>
<L>&mdash;And in his Hand a Reed</L>
<L>Stood waving <HI>tipt</HI> with Fire;&mdash;</L>
<L>The gra&s;&s;ie Clods now <HI>calv'd.</HI>&mdash;</L>
<L><HI>Spangled</HI> with Eyes&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>IN the&s;e and innumerable other In&s;tances, the Metaphors are very bold but ju&s;t; I mu&s;t however ob&s;erve, that the Metaphors are not thick &s;own in <HI>Milton,</HI> which always favours too much of Wit; that they never cla&s;h with one another, which, as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> ob&s;erves, turns a Sentence into a Kind of an Enigma or Riddle; and that he &s;eldom has
<PB N="24" REF="23">
Recour&s;e to them where the proper and natural Words will do as well.</P>
<P>ANOTHER way of rai&s;ing the Language, and giving it a Poetical Turn, is to make U&s;e of the Idioms of other Tongues. <HI>Virgil</HI> is full of the <HI>Greek</HI> Forms of Speech, which the Criticks call <HI>Helle|ni&s;ms,</HI> as <HI>Horace</HI> in his Odes abounds with them much more than <HI>Virgil.</HI> I need not mention the &s;everal Dialects which <HI>Homer</HI> has made u&s;e of for this End. <HI>Milton</HI> in Conformity with the Practice of the An|cient Poets, and with <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Rule, has infu&s;ed a great many <HI>Latini&s;ms</HI> as well as <HI>Graci&s;ms,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Hebrai&s;ms,</HI> into the Language of his Poem; as towards the Beginning of it, <Q><L><HI>Nor</HI> did they <HI>not</HI> perceive the evil plight</L>
<L>In which they were, <HI>or</HI> the fierce Pains <HI>not</HI> feel.</L>
<L>Yet <HI>to</HI> their Gen'ral's Voice they &s;oon obey'd.</L>
<L>&mdash;Who &s;hall tempt with wandring Fees</L>
<L>The dark unbottom'd Infinite Aby&s;s,</L>
<L>And through the <HI>palpable Ob&s;cure</HI> find out</L>
<L>His uncouth way, or &s;pread his airy Flight</L>
<L>&V;pborn with indefatigable Wings</L>
<L>Over the va&s;t <HI>Abrupt!</HI></L></Q> <Q><L>&mdash;So both a&s;cend</L>
<L>In the Vi&s;ions of God&mdash;</L><BIBL>B. 11.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>UNDER this Head may be reckoned the placing the Adjective after the Sub&s;tantive, the Tran&s;po&s;iti|on of Words, the turning the Adjective into a Sub|&s;tantive, with &s;everal other Foreign Modes of Speech, which this Poet has naturalized to give his Ver&s;e the greater Sound, and throw it out of Pro&s;e.</P>
<P>THE third Method mentioned by <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> is what agrees with the Genius of the <HI>Greek</HI> Language more than with that of any other Tongue, and is
<PB N="25" REF="24">
therefore more u&s;ed by <HI>Homer</HI> than by any other Poet. I mean the lengthning of a Phra&s;e by the Addition of Words, which may either be in&s;erted or omitted, as al&s;o by the extending or contracting of particular Words by the In&s;ertion or Omi&s;&s;ion of certain Syllables. <HI>Milton</HI> has put in practice this Method of rai&s;ing his Language, as far as the Na|ture of our Tongue will permit, as in the Pa&s;&s;age a|bove-mentioned, <HI>Eremite,</HI> for what is Hermite, in common Di&s;cour&s;e. If you ob&s;erve the Mea&s;ure of his Ver&s;e, he has with great Judgment &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a Syllable in &s;everal Words, and &s;hortned tho&s;e of two Syllables into one, by which Method, be&s;ides the above-mentioned Advantage, he has given a grea|ter Variety to his Numbers. But this Practice is more particularly remarkable in the Names of Per|&s;ons and of Countries, as <HI>Be&euml;lzebub, He&s;&s;ebon,</HI> and in many other Particulars, wherein he has either changed the Name, or made u&s;e of that which is not the mo&s;t commonly known, that he might the better depart from the Language of the Vulgar.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Rea&s;on recommended to him &s;everal old Words, which al&s;o makes his Poem appear the more venerable, and gives it a greater Air of An|tiquity.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t likewi&s;e take notice, that there are in <HI>Milton</HI> &s;everal Words of his own Coining, as <HI>Cer|berean, mi&s;created, hell-doom'd, Embryon</HI> Atoms, and many others. If the Reader is offended at this Li|berty in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poet, I would recommend him to a Di&s;cour&s;e in <HI>Plutarch,</HI> which &s;hews us how fre|quently <HI>Homer</HI> has made u&s;e of the &s;ame Li|berty.</P>
<P><HI>MILTON</HI> by the above-mentioned Helps, and by the Choice of the noble&s;t Words and Phra&s;es which our Tongue would afford him, has carried our Language to a greater height than any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets have ever done before or after him,
<PB N="26" REF="25">
and made the Sublimity of his Stile equal to that of his Sentiments,</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in the&s;e Ob&s;er|vations on <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Stile,</HI> becau&s;e it is that part of him in which he appears the mo&s;t &s;ingular. The Remarks I have here made upon the Practice of o|ther Poets, with my Ob&s;ervations out of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> will perhaps alleviate the Prejudice which &s;ome have taken to his Poem upon this Account; tho' after all, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I think his Stile, tho' ad|mirable in general, is in &s;ome places too much &s;tiffened and ob&s;cured by the frequent U&s;e of tho&s;e Methods, which <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> has pre&s;cribed for the rai&s;ing of it.</P>
<P>THIS Redundancy of tho&s;e &s;everal Ways of Speech which <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> calls <HI>foreign Language,</HI> and with which <HI>Milton</HI> has &s;o very much enriched, and in &s;ome places darkned the Language of his Poem, was the more proper for his u&s;e, becau&s;e his Poem is written in Blank Ver&s;e. Rhyme, without any other A&s;&s;i&s;tance, throws the Language off from Pro&s;e, and very often makes an indifferent Phra&s;e pa&s;s un|regarded; but where the Ver&s;e is not built upon Rhymes, there Pomp of Sound, and Energy of Expre&s;&s;ion, are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the Stile, and keep it from falling into the Flatne&s;s of Pro&s;e.</P>
<P>THOSE who have not a Ta&s;te for this Eleva|tion of Stile, and are apt to ridicule a Poet when he goes out of the common Forms of Expre&s;&s;ion, would do well to &s;ee how <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> has treated an Ancient Author, called <HI>Euclid,</HI> for his in&s;ipid Mirth upon this Occa&s;ion. Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> u&s;ed to call this &s;ort of Men his Pro&s;e-Criticks.</P>
<P>I &s;hould, under this Head of the Language, con&s;i|der <HI>Milton</HI>'s Numbers, in which he has made u&s;e of &s;everal Eli&s;ions, that are not cu&s;tomary among o|ther <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets, as may be particularly ob&s;erved
<PB N="27" REF="26">
in his cutting off the Letter <HI>Y,</HI> when it precedes a Vowel. This, and &s;ome other Innovations in the Mea&s;ure of his Ver&s;e, has varied his Numbers, in &s;uch a manner, as makes them incapable of &s;atiat|ing the Ear and cloying the Reader, which the &s;ame uniform Mea&s;ure would certainly have done, and which the perpetual Returns of Rhyme never fail to do in long Narrative Poems. I &s;hall clo&s;e the&s;e Re|flections upon the Language of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> with ob&s;erving that <HI>Milton</HI> has copied after <HI>Homer,</HI> rather than <HI>Virgil,</HI> in the length of his Periods, the Co|piou&s;ne&s;s of his Phra&s;es, and the running of his Ver&s;es into one another.</P>

<P>I Have now con&s;ider'd <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> under tho&s;e four great Heads of the Fable, the Cha|racters, the Sentiments, and the Language; and have &s;hewn that he excels, in general, under each of the&s;e Heads. I hope that I have made &s;everal Di&s;|coveries which may appear new, even to tho&s;e who are ver&s;ed in Critical Learning. Were I indeed to chu&s;e my Readers, by who&s;e Judgment I would &s;tand or fall, they &s;hould not be &s;uch as are ac|quainted only with the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Criticks, but al&s;o with the Antient and Modern who have
<PB N="28" REF="27">
written in either of the learned Languages. Above all, I would have them well ver&s;ed in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Poets, without which a Man very often fancies that he under&s;tands a Critick, when in reality he does not comprehend his Meaning.</P>
<P>IT is in Critici&s;m, as in all other Sciences and Speculations; one who brings with him any impli|eit Notions and Ob&s;ervations which he has made in his reading of the Poets, will find his own Re|flections methodized and explained, and perhaps &s;everal little Hints that had pa&s;&s;ed in his Mind, perfected and improved in the Works of a good Critick; whereas one who has not the&s;e previous Lights, is very often an utter Stranger to what he reads, and apt to put a wrong Interpretation upon it.</P>
<P>NOR is it &s;ufficient, that a Man who &s;ets up for a Judge in Critici&s;m, &s;hould have peru&s;ed the Au|thors above-mentioned, unle&s;s he has al&s;o a clear and logical Head. Without this Talent he is per|petually puzzled and perplexed amid&s;t his own Blunders, mi&s;takes the Sen&s;e of tho&s;e he would confute, or if he chances to think right, does not know how to convey his Thoughts to another with Clearne&s;s and Per&s;picuity. <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> who was the be&s;t Critick, was al&s;o one of the be&s;t Logicians that ever appeared in the World.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lock</HI>'s E&s;&s;ay on Human Under&s;tanding would be thought a very odd Book for a Man to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of, who would get a Reputation by Critical Writings; though at the &s;ame Time it is very certain, that an Author who has not learned the Art of di&s;tingui&s;hing between Words and Things, and of ranging his Thoughts, and &s;etting them in proper Lights, whatever Notions he may have, will lo&s;e him&s;elf in Confu&s;ion and Ob&s;curity. I might further ob&s;erve, that there is not a <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Latin</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="28">
Critick who has not &s;hewn, even in the Stile of his Critici&s;ms, that he was a Ma&s;ter of all the Elegance and Delicacy of his Native Tongue.</P>
<P>THE Truth of it is, there is nothing more ab|&s;urd than for a Man to &s;et up for a Critick, without a good In&s;ight into all the Parts of Learning; where|as many of tho&s;e who have endeavoured to &s;igna|lize them&s;elves by Works of this Nature among our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Writers, are not only defective in the above|mentioned Particulars, but plainly di&s;cover by the Phra&s;es which they make u&s;e of, and by their con|fu&s;ed way of thinking, that they are not acquainted with the mo&s;t common and ordinary Sy&s;tems of Arts and Sciences. A few general Rules extracted out of the <HI>French</HI> Authors, with a certain Cant of Words, has &s;ometimes &s;et up an illiterate heavy Writer for a mo&s;t judicious and formidable Cri|tick.</P>
<P>ONE great Mark, by which you may di&s;covet a Critick who has neither Ta&s;te nor Learning, is this, that he &s;eldom ventures to prai&s;e any Pa&s;&s;age in an Author which has not been before received and applauded by the Publick, and that his Critici&s;m turns wholly upon little Faults and Errors. This Part of a Critick is &s;o very ea&s;y to &s;ucceed in, that we find every ordinary Reader, upon the publi&s;hing of a new Poem, has Wit and Ill-nature enough to turn &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of it into Ridicule, and very often in the right Place. This Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has ve|ry agreeably remarked in tho&s;e two celebrated Lines, <Q><L>Errors, like Straws, upon the Surface flow;</L>
<L>He who would &s;earch for Pearls mu&s;t dive below.</L></Q></P>
<P>A true Critick ought to dwell rather upon Excel|lencies than Imperfections, to di&s;cover the conceal|ed Beauties of a Writer, and communicate to the
<PB N="30" REF="29">
World &s;uch Things as are worth their Ob&s;ervation. The mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Words and fine&s;t Strokes of an Author are tho&s;e which very often appear the mo&s;t doubtful and exceptionable, to a Man who wants a Reli&s;h for polite Learning; and they are the&s;e, which a &s;oure undi&s;tingui&s;hing Critick generally at|tacks with the greate&s;t Violence. <HI>Tully</HI> ob&s;erves, that it is very ea&s;y to brand or fix a Mark upon what he calls <HI>Verbum ardens,</HI> or, as it may be ren|dered into <HI>Engli&s;h, a glowing bold Expre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and to turn it into Ridicule by a cold ill-natured Cri|tici&s;m. A little Wit is equally capable of expo&s;ing a Beauty, and of aggravating a Fault; and though &s;uch a Treatment of an Author naturally produces Indignation in the Mind of an under&s;tanding Rea|der, it has however its Effect among the Generality of tho&s;e who&s;e Hands it falls into, the Rabble of Mankind being very apt to think that every thing which is laughed at with any Mixture of Wit, is ridiculous in it &s;elf.</P>
<P>SUCH a Mirth as this, is always un&s;ea&s;onable in a Critick, as it rather prejudices the Reader than convinces him, and is capable of making a Beauty, as well as a Blemi&s;h, the Subject of Deri&s;ion. A Man, who cannot write with Wit on a proper Subject, is dull and &s;tupid, but one who &s;hews it in an improper Place, is as impertinent and ab&s;urd. Be&s;ides, a Man who has the Gift of Ridicule, is apt to find Fault with any Thing that gives him an Op|portunity of exerting his beloved Talent, and very often cen&s;ures a Pa&s;&s;age, not becau&s;e there is any Fault in it, but becau&s;e he can be merry upon it. Such Kinds of Plea&s;antry are very unfair and di&s;|ingenuous in Works of Critici&s;m, in which the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters, both antient and modern, have always appeared with a &s;erious and in&s;tructive Air.</P>
<P>AS I intend in my next Paper to &s;hew the Defects in <HI>Milton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> I thought fit to premi&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="30">
the&s;e few Particulars, to the End that the Reader may know I enter upon it, as on a very ungrateful Work, and that I &s;hall ju&s;t point at the Imperfe|ctions, without endeavouring to enflame them with Ridicule. I mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve with <HI>Longinus,</HI> that the Productions of a great Genius, with many Lap&s;es and Inadvertencies, are infinitely preferable to the Works of an inferior Kind of Author, which are &s;crupulou&s;ly exact and conformable to all the Rules of correct Writing.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude my Paper with a Story out of <HI>Boccalini,</HI> which &s;ufficiently &s;hews us the Opinion that judicious Author entertained of the Sort of Criticks I have been here mentioning. A famous Critick, &s;ays he, having gathered together all the Faults of an eminent Poet, made a Pre&s;ent of them to <HI>A|pollo,</HI> who received them very graciou&s;ly, and re&s;olved to make the Author a &s;uitable Return for the Trouble he had been at in collecting them. In Or|der to this, he &s;et before him a Sack of Wheat, as it had been ju&s;t thre&s;hed out of the Sheaf. He then bid him pick out the Chaff from among the Corn, and lay it a&s;ide by it&s;elf. The Critick applied him|&s;elf to the Task with great Indu&s;try and Plea&s;ure, and after having made the due Separation, was pre&s;ented by <HI>Apollo</HI> with the Chaff for his Pains.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AFTER what I have &s;aid in my la&s;t <HI>Saturday</HI>'s Paper, I &s;hall enter on the Subject of this without farther Preface, and remark the &s;everal Defects which
<PB N="32" REF="31">
appear in the Fable, the Characters, the Senti|ments, and the Language of <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t;</HI> not doubting but the Reader will pardon me, if I alledge at the &s;ame Time whatever may be &s;aid for the Extenuation of &s;uch Defects. The fir&s;t Imperfe|ction which I &s;hall ob&s;erve in the Fable is, that the Event of it is unhappy.</P>
<P>THE Fable of every Poem is according to <HI>Ari|tatle</HI>'s Divi&s;ion either <HI>Simple</HI> or <HI>Implex.</HI> It is called Simple when there is no Change of Fortune in it, Implex when the Fortune of the chief Actor changes from Bad to Good, or from Good to Bad. The Im|plex Fable is thought the mo&s;t perfect; I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e it is more proper to &s;tir up the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Reader, and to &s;urprize him with a greater Va|riety of Accidents.</P>
<P>THE Implex Fable is therefore of two Kinds: In the fir&s;t the chief Actor makes his Way through a long Series of Dangers and Difficulties, 'till he arrives at Honour and Pro&s;perity, as we &s;ee in the Story of <HI>&V;li&s;&s;es.</HI> In the &s;econd, the chief Actor in the Poem falls from &s;ome eminent Pitch of Honour and Pro&s;perity, into Mi&s;ery and Di&s;grace. Thus we &s;ee <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> &s;inking from a State of Inno|cence and Happine&s;s, into the mo&s;t abject Con|dition of Sin and Sorrow.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t taking Tragedies among the An|tients were built on this la&s;t Sort of Implex Fable, particularly the Tragedy of <HI>OEdipus,</HI> which proceeds upon a Story, if we may believe <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> the mo&s;t proper for Tragedy that could be invented by the Wit of Man. I have taken &s;ome Pains in a former Paper to &s;hew, that this Kind of Implex Fable, wherein the Event is unhappy, is more apt to affect an Audience than that of the fir&s;t Kind; notwith|&s;tanding many excellent Pieces among the Antients, as well as mo&s;t of tho&s;e which have been written of late Years in our own Country, are rai&s;ed upon
<PB N="33" REF="32">
contrary Plans. I mu&s;t however own, that I think this Kind of Fable, which is the mo&s;t perfect in Tra|gedy, is not &s;o proper for an Heroick Poem.</P>
<P><HI>MILTON</HI> &s;eems to have been &s;en&s;ible of this Imperfection in his Fable, and has therefore endea|voured to cure it by &s;everal Expedients; particular|ly by the Mortification which the great Adver&s;ary of Mankind meets with upon his Return to the A&s;&s;embly of Infernal Spirits, as it is de&s;cribed in a beautiful Pa&s;&s;age of the tenth Book; and likewi&s;e by the Vi&s;ion, wherein <HI>Adam</HI> at the Clo&s;e of the Poem &s;ees his Off-&s;pring triumphing over his great Enemy, and him&s;elf re&s;tored to a happier <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> than that from which he fell.</P>
<P>THERE is another Objection again&s;t <HI>Milton</HI>'s Fable, which is indeed almo&s;t the &s;ame with the former, tho' placed in a different Light, namely, That the Hero in the <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> is un&s;ucce&s;sful, and by no Means a Match for his Enemies. This gave Occa&s;ion to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s Reflection, that the Devil was in reality <HI>Milton</HI>'s Hero. I think I have obviated this Objection in my fir&s;t Paper. The <HI>Para|di&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> is an Epic, or a Narrative Poem, and he that looks for an Hero in it, &s;earches for that which <HI>Milton</HI> never intended; but if he will needs fix the Name of an Hero upon any Per&s;on in it, 'tis cer|tainly the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> who is the Hero, both in the Principal Action, and in the chief Epi&s;odes. Paga|ni&s;m could not furni&s;h out a real Action for a Fable greater than that of the <HI>Iliad</HI> or <HI>Aeneid,</HI> and there|fore an Heathen could not form a higher Notion of a Poem than one of that Kind which they call an Heroic. Whether <HI>Milton</HI>'s is not of a &s;ublimer Nature I will not pre&s;ume to determine: It is &s;uf|ficient, that I &s;hew there is in the <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> all the Greatne&s;s of Plan, Regularity of De&s;ign, and ma&s;terly Beauties which we di&s;cover in <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">
I mu&s;t in the next Place ob&s;erve, that <HI>Milton</HI> has interwoven in the Texture of his Fable &s;ome Par|ticulars which do not &s;eem to have Probability enough for an Epic Poem, particularly in the Actions which he a&s;cribes to <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death,</HI> and the Picture which he draws of the <HI>Limbo of Vanity,</HI> with other Pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;econd Book. Such Allegories rather &s;avour of the Spirit of <HI>Spen&s;er</HI> and <HI>Ario&s;to,</HI> than of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Structure of his Poem he has likewi&s;e ad|mitted of too many Digre&s;&s;ions. It is finely ob&s;er|ved by <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> that the Author of an Heroic Poem &s;hould &s;eldom &s;peak him&s;elf, but throw as much of his Work as he can into the Mouths of tho&s;e who are his principal Actors. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> has given no Rea&s;on for this Precept; but I pre&s;ume it is be|cau&s;e the Mind of the Reader is more awed and ele|vated when he hears <HI>Aeneas</HI> or <HI>Achilles</HI> &s;peak, than when <HI>Virgil</HI> or <HI>Homer</HI> talk in their own Per&s;ons. Be|&s;ides that a&s;&s;uming the Character of an eminent Man is apt to fire the Imagination, and rai&s;e the Ideas of the Author. <HI>Tully</HI> tells us, mentioning his Dialogue of old Age, in which <HI>Cato</HI> is the chief Speaker, that upon a Review of it he was agreeably impo&s;ed upon, and fancied that it was <HI>Cato,</HI> and not he him&s;elf, who uttered his Thoughts on that Subject.</P>
<P>IF the Reader would be at the Pains to &s;ee how the Story of the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Aeneid</HI> is delivered by tho&s;e Per&s;ons who act in it, he will be &s;urpri&s;ed to find how little in either of the&s;e Poems proceeds from the Authors. <HI>Milton</HI> has, in the general Di&s;|po&s;ition of his Fable, very finely ob&s;erved this great Rule; in&s;omuch, that there is &s;carce a third Part of it which comes from the Poet; the re&s;t is &s;poken either by <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> or by &s;ome Good or Evil Spirit who is engaged either in their De&s;truction or Defence.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34">
FROM what has been here ob&s;erved, it appears, that Digre&s;&s;ions are by no Means to be allowed of in an Epic Poem. If the Poet, even in the ordina|ry Cour&s;e of his Narration, &s;hould &s;peak as little as po&s;&s;ible, he &s;hould certainly never let his Narra|tion &s;leep for the &s;ake of any Reflections of his own. I have often ob&s;erved, with a &s;ecret Admi|ration, that the longe&s;t Reflection in the <HI>Aeneid</HI> is in that Pa&s;&s;age of the Tenth Book, where <HI>Tur|nus</HI> is repre&s;ented as dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in the Spoils of <HI>Pallas,</HI> whom he had &s;lain. <HI>Virgil</HI> here lets his Fable &s;tand &s;till for the Sake of the following Re|mark. <HI>How is the Mind of Man ignorant of Futurity, and unable to bear pro&s;perous Fortune with Moderation? The Time will come when</HI> Turnus <HI>&s;hall wi&s;h that he had left the Body of</HI> Pallas <HI>untouched, and cur&s;e the Day on which he dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the&s;e Spoils.</HI> As the great Event of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> and the Death of <HI>Turnus,</HI> whom <HI>Aeneas</HI> &s;lew, becau&s;e he &s;aw him adorned with the Spoils of <HI>Pallas,</HI> turns upon this Incident, <HI>Virgil</HI> went out of his Way to make this Reflection upon it, without which &s;o &s;mall a Cir|cum&s;tance might po&s;&s;ibly have &s;lipped out of his Reader's Memory. <HI>Lucan,</HI> who was an Injudicious Poet, lets drop his Story very frequently for the Sake of his unnece&s;&s;ary Digre&s;&s;ions, or his <HI>Diver|ticula,</HI> as <HI>Scaliger</HI> calls them. If he gives us an Ac|count of the Prodigies which preceded the Civil War, he declaims upon the Occa&s;ion, and &s;hews how much happier it would be for Man, if he did not feel his evil Fortune before it comes to pa&s;s, and &s;uffer not only by its real Weight, but by the Apprehen&s;ion of it. <HI>Milton</HI>'s Complaint for his Blindne&s;s, his Panegyrick on Marriage, his Refle|ctions on <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI>'s going naked, of the Angels eating, and &s;everal other Pa&s;&s;ages in his Poem, are liable to the &s;ame Exception, tho' I mu&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="35">
confe&s;s there is &s;o great a Beauty in the&s;e very Di|gre&s;&s;ions that I would not with them our of his Poem.</P>
<P>I have, in a former Paper, &s;poken of the <HI>Chara|cters</HI> of <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> and declared my O|pinion, as to the Allegorical Per&s;ons who are intro|duced in it.</P>
<P>IF we look into the <HI>Sentiments,</HI> I think they are &s;ometimes defective under the following Heads; Fir&s;t, as there are &s;everal of them too much point|ed, and &s;ome that degenerate even into Punns. Of this la&s;t Kind, I am afraid is that in the Fir&s;t Book, where, &s;peaking of the Pigmies, he calls them <Q><L>&mdash;The &s;mall <HI>Infantry</HI></L>
<L>Warr'd on by Cranes&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>ANOTHER Blemi&s;h that appears in &s;ome of his Thoughts, is his frequent Allu&s;ion to Heathen Fables, which are not certainly of a Piece with the Divine Subject, of which he treats. I do not find Fault with the&s;e Allu&s;ions, where the Poet him&s;elf repre&s;ents them as fabulous, as he does in &s;ome Places, but where he mentions them as Truths and Matters of Fact. The Limits of my Paper will not give me Leave to be particular in In&s;tances of this Kind: The Reader will ea&s;ily remark them in his Peru&s;al of the Poem.</P>
<P>A Third Fault in his Sentiments, is an unnece&s;|&s;ary O&s;tentation of Learning, which likewi&s;e occurs very frequently. It is certain, that both <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> were Ma&s;ters of all the Learning of their Times, but it &s;hews it&s;elf in their Works, after an indirect and concealed Manner. <HI>Milton</HI> &s;eems am|bitions of letting us know, by his Excur&s;ions on Free-Will and Prede&s;tination, and his many Glances upon Hi&s;tory, A&s;tronomy, Geography and the like,
<PB N="37" REF="36">
as well as by the Terms and Phra&s;es he &s;ometimes makes U&s;e of, that he was acquainted with the whole Circle of Arts and Sciences.</P>
<P>IF, in the la&s;t Place, we con&s;ider the <HI>Language</HI> of this great Poet, we mu&s;t allow what I have hinted in a former Paper, that it is often too much labour|ed, and &s;ometimes ob&s;cured by old Words, Tran&s;|po&s;itions, and Foreign Idioms. <HI>Seneca</HI>'s Objection to the Stile of a great Author, <HI>Rigot ojus oratio, ni|hil in ea placidum nihil lene,</HI> is what many Criticks make to <HI>Milton:</HI> As I cannot wholly refute it, &s;o I have already apologized for it in another Paper; to which I may further add, that <HI>Milton</HI>'s Senti|ments and Ideas were &s;o wonderfully &s;ublime, that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for him to have re|pre&s;ented them in their full Strength and Beauty, without having Recour&s;e to the&s;e Foreign A&s;&s;i|&s;tances. Our Language &s;unk under him, and was unequal to that Greatne&s;s of Soul, which furni&s;hed him with &s;uch glorious Conceptions.</P>
<P>A &s;econd Fault in his Language is, that he often affects a Kind of Jingle in his Words, as in the following Pa&s;&s;ages, and many others: <Q><L>And brought into the <HI>World</HI> a <HI>World of</HI> Woe.</L>
<L>&mdash;Begirt th' Almighty Throne</L>
<L><HI>Be&s;eeching</HI> or <HI>be&s;ieging</HI>&mdash;</L>
<L>This <HI>tempted</HI> our <HI>Attempt</HI>&mdash;</L>
<L>At one &s;light <HI>Bound</HI> high over-leapt all <HI>Bound.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>I know there are Figures for this Kind of Speech, that &s;ome of the greate&s;t Antients have been guil|ty of it, and that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> him&s;elf has given it a Place in his Rhetorick among the Beauties of that Art. But as it is in it&s;elf poor and trifling, it is I think at pre&s;ent univer&s;ally exploded by all the Ma|&s;ters of polite Writing.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37">
THE la&s;t Fault which I &s;hall take Notice of in <HI>Milton</HI>'s Stile, is the frequent U&s;e of what the Learn|ed call <HI>Technical Words,</HI> or Terms of Art. It is one of the great Beauties of Poetry, to make hard Things intelligible, and to deliver what is ab&s;tru&s;e of it &s;elf in &s;uch ea&s;y Language as may be under|&s;tood by ordinary Readers: Be&s;ides, that the Know|ledge of a Poet &s;hould rather &s;eem born with him, or in&s;pired, than drawn from Books and Sy&s;tems. I have often wondered, how Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> could tran&s;late a Pa&s;&s;age out of <HI>Virgil,</HI> after the following Manner, <Q><L>Tack to the Larboard, and &s;tand off to Sea,</L>
<L>Veer Star-board Sea and Land.&mdash;</L></Q> <HI>Milton</HI> makes U&s;e of <HI>Larboard</HI> in the &s;ame Manner. When he is upon Building, he mentions <HI>Doric Pillars, Pila&s;ters, Cornice, Freeze, Architrave.</HI> When he talks of Heavenly Bodies, you meet with <HI>Ecli|ptic,</HI> and <HI>Eccentric,</HI> the <HI>Trepidation, Stars dropping from the Zenith, Rays culminating from the Equator.</HI> To which might be added many In&s;tances of the like Kind in &s;everal other Arts and Sciences.</P>

<P>I Have &s;een in the Works of a modern Philo&s;o|pher, a Map of the Spots in the Sun. My la&s;t Paper of the Faults and Blemi&s;hes in <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Pa|radi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> may be con&s;idered as a Piece of the &s;ame Nature. To pur&s;ue the Allu&s;ion: As it is ob|&s;erved, that among the bright Parts of the lumi|nous Body above-mentioned, there are &s;ome which glow more inten&s;ely, and dart a &s;tronger Light than others; &s;o, notwith&s;tanding I have already &s;hewn <HI>Milton</HI>'s Poem to be very beautiful in general, I &s;hall now proceed to take Notice of &s;uch Beauties as appear to me more exqui&s;ite than the re&s;t. <HI>Mil|ton</HI> has propo&s;ed the Subject of his Poem in the following Ver&s;es. <Q><L>Of Mans fir&s;t di&s;obedience, and the fruit</L>
<L>Of that forbidden tree who&s;e mortal ta&s;te</L>
<L>Brought Death into the world and all our woe,</L>
<L>With lo&s;s of <HI>Eden,</HI> 'till one greater Man</L>
<L>Re&s;tore us, and regain the bli&s;sful Seat,</L>
<L>Sing Heav'nly Mu&s;e&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>THESE Lines are perhaps as plain, &s;imple and unadorned as any of the whole Poem, in which Particular the Author has conform'd him&s;elf to the Example of <HI>Homer,</HI> and the Precept of <HI>Horace.</HI></P>
<P>HIS Invocation to a Work which turns in a great Mea&s;ure upon the Creation of the World, is very
<PB N="40" REF="39">
properly made to the Mu&s;e who in&s;pired <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in tho&s;e Books from whence our Author drew his Subject, and to the Holy Spirit who is therein re|pre&s;ented as operating after a particular Manner in the fir&s;t Production of Nature. This whole Exor|dium ri&s;es very happily into noble Language and Sentiment, as I think the Tran&s;ition to the Fable is exqui&s;itely beautiful and natural.</P>
<P>THE Nine-days A&s;toni&s;hment, in which the An|gels lay entranced after their dreadful Overthrow and Fall from Heaven, before they could recover either the U&s;e of Thought or Speech, is a noble <HI>Circum&s;tance,</HI> and very finely imagined.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. He&s;iod.</NOTE> The Divi&s;ion of Hell into Seas of Fire, and into firm Ground impregnated with the &s;ame furious Element, with that particu|lar Circum&s;tance of the Exclu&s;ion of <HI>Hope</HI> from tho&s;e infernal Regions, are In&s;tances of the &s;ame great and fruitful Invention.</P>
<P>THE Thoughts in the fir&s;t Speech and De&s;crip|tion of <HI>Satan,</HI> who is one of the principal Actors in this Poem, are wonderfully proper to give us a full Idea of him. His Pride, Envy and Revenge, Ob&s;ti|nacy, De&s;pair and Impenitence, are all of them very artfully interwoven. In &s;hort, his fir&s;t Speech is a Complication of all tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions which di&s;cover them&s;elves &s;eparately in &s;everal other of his Speeches in the Poem. The whole Part of this great Enemy of Mankind is filled with &s;uch Inci|dents as are very apt to rai&s;e and terrify the Reader's Imagination. Of this Nature, in the Book now be|fore us, is his being the fir&s;t that awakens out of the general Trance, with his Po&s;ture on the burning Lake, his ri&s;ing from it, and the De&s;cription of his Shield and Spear. <Q><L>Thus <HI>Satan</HI> talking to his neare&s;t mate,</L>
<L>With head up-life above the wave, and eyes</L>
<L><PB N="41" REF="40">
That &s;parkling blazed, his other parts be&s;ide</L>
<L>Prone on the Flood, extended long and large,</L>
<L>Lay floating many a rood&mdash;</L>
<L>Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool</L>
<L>His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames</L>
<L>Driv'n backward &s;lope their pointing Spires, and rowl'd</L>
<L>In Billows leave i'th' mid&s;t a horrid vale.</L>
<L>Then with expanded Wings he &s;teers his flight</L>
<L>Alo&s;t, incumbent on the dusky Air</L>
<L>That felt unu&s;ual weight&mdash;</L>
<L>&mdash;His pondrous Shield,</L>
<L>Ethereal temper, ma&s;&s;ie, large and round,</L>
<L>Behind him ca&s;t; the broad Circumference</L>

<L>At Ev'ning from the top of <HI>Fe&s;ole,</HI></L>
<L>Or in <HI>Valdatno</HI> to de&s;ory new Lands,</L>
<L>Rivers or Mountains on her &s;potty Globe.</L>
<L>His Spear to equal which the talle&s;t pine</L>
<L>Hewn on <HI>Norwegian</HI> Hills to be the Ma&s;t</L>

<L>He walk'd with to &s;upport unea&s;y Steps</L>
<L>Over the burning Marl&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>TO which we may add his Call to the fallen An|gels that lay plunged and &s;tupified in the Sea of Fire. <Q><L>He call'd &s;o loud, that all the hollow deep</L>
<L>Of Hell re&s;ounded&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>BUT there is no &s;ingle Pa&s;&s;age in the whole Poem worked up to a greater Sublimity, than that where|in his Per&s;on is de&s;cribed in tho&s;e celebrated Lines: <Q><L>&mdash;He, above the re&s;t</L>
<L>In Shape and Ge&s;ture proudly eminent</L>
<L>Stood like a Tower, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="41">
HIS Sentiments are every way an&s;werable to his Character, and &s;uitable to a created Being of the mo&s;t exalted and mo&s;t depraved Nature. Such is that in which he takes Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Place of Torments. <Q><L>&mdash;Hail Horrors, hail</L>
<L>Infernal World, and thou profounde&s;t Hill</L>
<L>Receive thy new Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, one who brings</L>

<L>To reign is worth ambition, tho' in Hell:</L>
<L>Better to reign in Hell, than &s;erve in Heaven.</L></Q></P>
<P>AMIDST tho&s;e Impieties which this Enraged Spirit utters in other Places of the Poem, the Au|thor has taken Care to introduce none that is not big with Ab&s;urdity, and incapable of &s;hocking a Re|ligious Reader; his Words, as the Poet de&s;cribes them, bearing only a <HI>Semblance of Worth, not Sub|&s;tance.</HI> He is likewi&s;e with great Art de&s;cribed as owning his Adver&s;ary to be Almighty. Whatever perver&s;e Interpetation he puts on the Ju&s;tice, Mer|cy, and other Attributes of the Supreme Being, he frequently confe&s;&s;es his Omnipotence, that being the Perfection he was forced to allow him, and the only Con&s;ideration which could &s;upport his Pride under the Shame of his Defeat.</P>
<P>NOR mu&s;t I here omit that beautiful Circum|&s;tance of his bur&s;ting out in Tears, upon his Sur|vey of tho&s;e innumerable Spirits whom he had in|volved in the &s;ame Guilt and Ruin with him&s;elf. <Q><PB N="43" REF="42">

<P>THE Catalogue of Evil Spirits has Abundance of Learning in it, and a very agreeable Turn of Poetry, which ri&s;es in a great mea&s;ure from its de|&s;cribing the Places where they were wor&s;hipped, by tho&s;e beautiful Marks of Rivers, &s;o frequent among the Antient Poets. The Author had doubtle&s;s in this Place <HI>Homer</HI>'s Catalogue of Ships, and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Lift of Warriors in his view. The Characters of <HI>Moloch</HI> and <HI>Belial</HI> prepare the Reader's Mind for their re&s;pective Speeches and Behaviour in the &s;e|cond and &s;ixth Book. The Account of <HI>Thammuz</HI> is finely Romantick, and &s;uitable to what we read among the Antients of the Wor&s;hip which was paid to that Idol. <Q><L>&mdash;<HI>Thammuz</HI> came next behind,</L>
<L>Who&s;e annual Wound in <HI>Lebanon</HI> allur'd</L>
<L>The <HI>Syrian</HI> Dam&s;els to lament his fate,</L>
<L>In am'rous Ditties all a Summer's day,</L>
<L>While &s;mooth <HI>Adonis</HI> from his native Rock</L>
<L>Ran purple to the Sea, &s;uppos'd with Blood</L>
<L>Of <HI>Thammuz</HI> yearly wounded: the Love-tale,</L>

<L>Of alienated <HI>Judah.</HI>&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The Reader will pardon me if I in&s;ert as a Note on this beautiful Pa&s;&s;age, the Account given us by the late ingenious Mr. <HI>Maundrell</HI> of this Anti|ent
<PB N="44" REF="43">
Piece of Wor&s;hip, and probably the fir&s;t Oc|ca&s;ion of &s;uch a Super&s;tition. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'We came to a fair large River&mdash;doubtle&s;s the Antient River <HI>Adonis,</HI> &s;o famous for the Idolatrous Rites perform'd here in Lamentation of <HI>Adonis.</HI> We had the Fortune to &s;ee what may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Occa&s;ion of that Opinion which <HI>Lucian</HI> relates, concerning this River, <HI>viz.</HI> That this Stream, at certain Sea|&s;ons of the Year, e&s;pecially about the Fea&s;t of <HI>A|donis,</HI> is of a bloody Colour; which the Heathens looked upon as proceeding from a kind of Sym|pathy in the River for the Death of <HI>Adonis,</HI> who was killed by a wild Boar in the Mountains, out of which this Stream ri&s;es. Something like this we &s;aw actually come to pa&s;s; for the Water was &s;tain'd to a &s;urpri&s;ing redne&s;s; and, as we ob&s;erv'd in Travelling, had di&s;colour'd the Sea a great way into a reddi&s;h Hue, occa&s;ion'd doubtle&s;s by a &s;ort of Minium, or red Earth, wa&s;hed into the River by the violence of the Rain, and not by any &s;tain from <HI>Adonis</HI>'s Blood.'</Q></P>
<P>THE Pa&s;&s;age in the Catalogue, explaining the manner how Spirits transform them&s;elves by Con|traction, or Enlargement of their Dimen&s;ions, is introduced with great Judgment, to make way for &s;everal &s;urpri&s;ing Accidents in the Sequel of the Poem. There follows one, at the very End of the Fir&s;t Book, which is what the <HI>French</HI> Criticks call <HI>Marvellous,</HI> but at the &s;ame Time <HI>probable</HI> by rea&s;on of the Pa&s;&s;age la&s;t mentioned. As &s;oon as the In|fernal Palace is fini&s;hed, we are told the Multitude and Rabble of Spirits immediately &s;hrunk them|&s;elves into a &s;mall Compa&s;s, that there might be Room for &s;uch a numberle&s;s A&s;&s;embly in this ca|pacious Hall. But it is the Poet's Refinement upon this Thought, which I mo&s;t admire, and which is indeed very noble in its &s;elf. For he tells us, that notwith&s;tanding the vulgar, among the fallen Spi|rits,
<PB N="45" REF="44">
contracted their Forms, tho&s;e of the fir&s;t Rank and Dignity &s;till pre&s;erved their natural Di|men&s;ions. <Q><L>Thus incorporeal Spirits to &s;malle&s;t Forms</L>
<L>Reduc'd their Shapes immen&s;e, and were at large</L>
<L>Though without Number &s;till amid&s;t the Hall</L>
<L>Of that infernal Court. But far within,</L>
<L>And in their own Dimen&s;ions like them&s;elves,</L>

<P>THE Character of <HI>Mammon,</HI> and the De&s;crip|tion of the <HI>Pandamonium,</HI> are full of Beauties.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal other Strokes in the Fir&s;t Book wonderfully poetical, and In&s;tances of that Sublime Genius &s;o peculiar to the Author. Such is the De&s;cription of <HI>Azazel</HI>'s Stature, and of the Infernal Standard, which he unfurls; as al&s;o of that gha&s;tly Light, by which the Fiends appear to one another in their Place of Torments. <Q><L>The Seat of Do&s;olation, void of Light,</L>
<L>Save what the glimm'ring of tho&s;e livid Flames</L>
<L>Ca&s;ts pale and dreadful&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Shout of the whole Ho&s;t of fallen Angels when drawn up in Battel Array: <Q><L>&mdash;The &V;niver&s;al Ho&s;t up &s;ent</L>
<L>A Shout that tore Hell's Concave, and beyond</L>

<L>As from a Sky&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>THERE are al&s;o &s;everal noble Similies and Al|lu&s;ions in the fir&s;t Book of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</HI> And here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that when <HI>Milton</HI> alludes either to Things or Per&s;ons, he never quits his Simile till it ri&s;es to &s;ome very great Idea, which is often fo|reign to the Occa&s;ion that gave Birth to it. The Re&s;emblance does not, perhaps, la&s;t above a Line or two, but the Poet runs on with the Hint, till he
<PB N="47" REF="46">
has rai&s;ed out of it &s;ome glorious Image or Senti|ment, proper to inflame the Mind of the Reader, and to give it that &s;ublime Kind of Entertainment, which is &s;uitable to the Nature of an Heroic Po|em. Tho&s;e, who are acquainted with <HI>Homer</HI>'s and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Way of Writing, cannot but be plea&s;ed with this Kind of Structure in <HI>Milton</HI>'s Similitudes. I am the more particular on this Head, becau&s;e ignorant Readers, who have formed their Ta&s;te upon the quaint Similies, and little Turns of Wit, which are &s;o much in Vogue among modern Poets, cannot reli&s;h the&s;e Beauties which are of a much higher Nature, and are therefore apt to cen&s;ure <HI>Milton</HI>'s Compari&s;ons, in which they do not &s;ee any &s;urpri|&s;ing Points of Likene&s;s. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Perrault</HI> was a Man of this vitiated Reli&s;h, and for that very Rea|&s;on has endeavoured to turn into Ridicule &s;everal of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Similitudes, which he calls <HI>Comparai&s;ons a longue queue, Long-tail'd Compari&s;ons.</HI> I &s;hall con|clude this Paper on the Fir&s;t Book of <HI>Milton</HI> with the An&s;wer which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Boileau</HI> makes to <HI>Per|rault</HI> on this Occa&s;ion; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Compari&s;ons, &s;ays he, in Odes and Epic Poems are not introduced only to illu&s;trate and embelli&s;h the Di&s;cour&s;e, but to a|mu&s;e and relax the Mind of the reader, by fre|quently di&s;engaging him from too painful an At|tention to the principal Subject, and by leading him into other agreeable Images. <HI>Homer,</HI> &s;ays he, excelled in this Particular, who&s;e Compari&s;ons a|bound with &s;uch Images of Nature as are proper to relieve and diver&s;ifie his Subjects. He conti|nually in&s;tructs the Reader, and makes him take notice, even in Objects which are every Day be|fore our Eyes, of &s;uch Circum&s;tances as we &s;hould not otherwi&s;e have ob&s;erved. <HI>To this he adds, as a Maxim univer&s;ally acknowledged,</HI> that it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary in Poetry for the Points of the Compari|&s;on to corre&s;pond with one another exactly, but
<PB N="48" REF="47" MS="y">
that a general Re&s;emblance is &s;ufficient, and that too much Nicety in this Particular &s;avours of the Rhetorician and Epigrammati&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>IN &s;hort, if we look into the Conduct of <HI>Homer, Virgil</HI> and <HI>Milton,</HI> as the great Fable is the Soul of each Poem, &s;o to give their Works an agreeable Variety, their Epi&s;odes are &s;o many &s;hort Fables, and their Similes &s;o many &s;hort Epi&s;odes; to which you may add, if you plea&s;e, that their Metaphors are &s;o many &s;hort Similes. If the Reader con&s;iders the Compari&s;ons in the fir&s;t Book of <HI>Milton,</HI> of the Sun in an Eclip&s;e, of the fleeping <HI>Leviathan,</HI> of the Bees &s;warming about their Hive, of the fairy Dance, in the View wherein I have here placed them, he will ea&s;ily di&s;cover the great Beauties that are in each of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages.</P>

<P>I Have before ob&s;erved in general, that the Per|&s;ons whom <HI>Milton</HI> introduces into his Poem al|ways di&s;cover &s;uch Sentiments and Behaviour, as are in a peculiar Manner conformable to their re&s;pective Characters. Every Circum&s;tance in their Speeches and Actions, is with great Ju&s;tne&s;s and Delicacy a|dapted to the Per&s;ons who &s;peak and act.

<PB N="49" REF="48" MS="y">
Pa&s;&s;ages of the Second Book in this Light. That &s;uperior Greatne&s;s, and Mock-Maje&s;ty, which is a|&s;cribed to the Prince of the fallen Angels, is admi|rably pre&s;erved in the Beginning of this Book. His opening and clo&s;ing the Debate; his taking on him|&s;elf that great Enterprize at the Thought of which the whole infernal A&s;&s;embly trembled; his encoun|tring the hideous Phantom who guarded the Gates of Hell, and appeared to him in all his Terrors; are In&s;tances of that proud and daring Mind which could not brook Submi&s;&s;ion even to Omnipotence. <Q><L>SATAN was now at Hand, and from his Seat</L>
<L>The Mon&s;ter moving onward came as fa&s;t</L>
<L>With horrid Strides, Hell trembled as he &s;trode,</L>
<L>Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd,</L>

<P>THE &s;ame Boldne&s;s and Intrepidity of Behavi|our di&s;covers it &s;elf in the &s;everal Adventures, which he meets with during his Pa&s;&s;age through the Re|gions of unformed Matter, and particularly in his Addre&s;s to tho&s;e tremendous Powers who are de|&s;cribed as pre&s;iding over it.</P>
<P>THE Part of <HI>Moloch</HI> is likewi&s;e in all its Circum|&s;tances full of that Fire and Fury, which di&s;tingui&s;h this Spirit from the re&s;t of the fallen Angels. He is de&s;cribed in the fir&s;t Book as be&s;meared with the Blood of humane Sacrifices, and delighted with the Tears of Parents and the Cries of Children. In the &s;econd Book he is marked out as the fierce&s;t Spi|rit that fought in Heaven; and if we con&s;ider the Figure which he makes in the &s;ixth Book, where the Battel of the Angels is de&s;cribed, we find it every Way an&s;werable to the &s;ame furious enraged Character. <Q><L>&mdash;Where the might of <HI>Gabriel</HI> fought,</L>
<L>And with fierce En&s;igns pierc'd the deep array</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="49">
Of <HI>Molec,</HI> furious King, who him defy'd,</L>
<L>And at his Chariot wheels to drag him bound</L>
<L>Threaten'd, nor from the holy one of Heav'n</L>
<L>Refrain'd his Tongue bla&s;phemous; but anon</L>
<L>Down cloven to the wa&s;te, with &s;hatter'd arms</L>
<L>And uncouth pain fle'd bellowing.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>IT may be worth while to ob&s;erve, that <HI>Milton</HI> has repre&s;ented this violent impetuous Spirit, who is hurried on by &s;uch precipitate Pa&s;&s;ions, as the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> that ri&s;es in that A&s;&s;embly, to give his Opini|on upon their pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of Affairs. Accor|dingly he declares him&s;elf abruptly for War, and appears incen&s;ed at his Companions, for lo&s;ing &s;o much Time as even to deliberate upon it. All his Sentiments are ra&s;h, audacious and de&s;perate. Such is that of arming them&s;elves with their Tortures, and turning their Puni&s;hments upon him who infli|cted them. <Q><L>&mdash;No, let us rather chu&s;e,</L>
<L>Arm'd with Hell-flames and fury, all at once</L>
<L>O'er Heav'ns high tow'rs to force re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Way,</L>

<L>Mixt with <HI>Tartarean</HI> Sulphur, and &s;trange Fire,</L>
<L>His own invented Torments&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>HIS preferring Annihilation to Shame or Mi&s;e|ry, is al&s;o highly &s;uitable to his Character; as the Comfort he draws from their di&s;turbing the Peace of Heaven, that if it be not Victory it is Revenge, is a Sentiment truly diabolical, and becoming the Bitterne&s;s of this implacable Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="50">
<HI>BELIAL</HI> is de&s;cribed, in the fir&s;t Book, as the Idol of the lewd and luxurious. He is in the &s;e|cond Book, pur&s;uant to that De&s;cription, characte|ri&s;ed as timorous and &s;lothful; and if we look in|to the &s;ixth Book, we find him celebrated in the Battel of Angels for Nothing but that Scoffing Speech which he makes to <HI>Satan,</HI> on their &s;uppo|&s;ed Advantage over the Enemy. As his Appearance is uniform, and of a piece in the&s;e three &s;everal Views, we find his Sentiments in the infernal A&s;|&s;embly every Way conformable to his Character. Such are his Apprehen&s;ions of a &s;econd Battel, his Horrors of Annihilation, his preferring to be mi&s;e|rable rather than <HI>not to be.</HI> I need not ob&s;erve, that the Contra&s;t of Thought in this Speech, and that which precedes it, gives an agreeable Variety to the Debate.</P>
<P><HI>MAMMON</HI>'s Character is &s;o fully drawn in the fir&s;t Book, that the Poet adds Nothing to it in the Second. We were before told, that he was the fir&s;t who taught Mankind to ran&s;ack the Earth for Gold and Silver, and that he was the Architect of <HI>Pandaemonium,</HI> or the infernal Palace, where the evil Spirits were to meet in Council. His Speech in this Book is every where &s;uitable to &s;o depraved a Cha|racter. How proper is that Reflection, of their be|ing unable to ta&s;te the Happine&s;s of Heaven were they actually there, in the Mouth of one, who while he was in Heaven is &s;aid to have had his Mind dazled with the outward Pomps and Glories of the Place, and to have been more intent on the Riches of the Pavement, than on the beatifick Vi&s;ion. I &s;hall al&s;o leave the Reader to judge how agreeable the following Sentiments are to the &s;ame Chara|cter. <Q><L>&mdash;This deep World</L>
<L>Of Darkne&s;s do we dread? How oft amid&s;t</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="51">

<L>Covers his Throne; from whence deep Thunders rear</L>
<L>Mu&s;tring their Rage, and Heav'n re&s;embles Hell?</L>
<L>As he our Darkne&s;s, cannot we his Light</L>

<L>Wants not her hidden Lu&s;tre, Gems and Gold;</L>
<L>Nor want we Skill or Art, from whence to rai&s;e</L>

<P><HI>BEELZEB&V;B,</HI> who is reckon'd the &s;econd in Dignity that fell, and is in the fir&s;t Book, the &s;e|cond that awakens out of the Trance, and confers with <HI>Satan</HI> upon the Situation of their Affairs, maintains his Rank in the Book now before us. There is a wonderful Maje&s;ty de&s;cribed in his ri&s;ing up to &s;peak. He acts as a Kind of Moderator be|tween the two oppo&s;ite Parties, and propo&s;es a third Undertaking, which the whole A&s;&s;embly gives into. The Motion he makes of detaching one of their Body in Search of a new World is grounded upon a Project devi&s;ed by <HI>Satan,</HI> and cur&s;orily propo&s;ed by him in the following Lines of the fir&s;t Book. <Q><L>Space may produce new Worlds, whereof &s;o ri&s;e</L>
<L>There went a Fame in Heav'n, that he e'er long</L>
<L>Intended to create, and therein plant</L>
<L>A Generation, whom his choice regard</L>
<L>Should favour equal to the Sons of Heav'n:</L>
<L>Thither, if but to pry, &s;hall be perhaps</L>
<L>Our fir&s;t Eruption, thither or el&s;ewhere:</L>
<L>For this infernal Pit &s;hall never hold</L>
<L>Cele&s;tial Spirits in bondage, nor th' Aby&s;s</L>
<L>Long under Darkne&s;s cover. But the&s;e Thoughts</L>
<L>Full Coun&s;el mu&s;t mature:&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>IT is on this Project that <HI>Beelzebub</HI> grounds his Propo&s;al. <Q><PB N="53" REF="52">
<L>&mdash;What if we find</L>
<L>Some ea&s;ier Enterprize? There is a Place</L>

<L>Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath,</L>
<L>That &s;hook Heav'ns whole Circumference, confirm'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Reader may ob&s;erve how ju&s;t it was, not to omit in the fir&s;t Book the Project upon which the whole Poem turns: As al&s;o that the Prince of the fall'n Angels was the only proper Per&s;on to give it Birth, and that he next to him in Dignity was the fitte&s;t to &s;econd and &s;upport it.</P>
<P>THERE is be&s;ides, I think, &s;omething wonder|fully beautiful, and very apt to affect the Reader's Imagination, in this antient Prophecy or Report in Heaven, concerning the Creation of Man. No|thing could &s;hew more the Dignity of the Species, than this Tradition which ran of them before their Exi&s;tence. They are repre&s;ented to have been the Talk of Heaven, before they were created. <HI>Virgil,</HI> in compliment to the <HI>Roman</HI> Common-wealth, makes the Heroes of it appear in their State of Pre-exi|&s;tence; but <HI>Milton</HI> does a far greater Honour to Mankind in general, as he gives us a Glimp&s;e of them even before they are in Being.</P>
<P>THE ri&s;ing of this great A&s;&s;embly is de&s;cri|bed in a very &s;ublime and poetical Manner. <Q><L>Their ri&s;ing all at once was as the &s;ound</L>
<L>Of Thunder heard remote&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Diver&s;ions of the fallen Angels, with the particular Account of their Place of Habitation, are
<PB N="54" REF="53">
de&s;cribed with great Pregnancy of Thought, and Co|piou&s;ne&s;s of Invention. The Diver&s;ions are every way &s;uitable to Beings who had Nothing left them but Strength and Knowledge mi&s;applied. Such are their Contentions at the Race, and in Feats of Arms, with their Entertainment in the following Lines. <Q><L>Others with va&s;t <HI>Typhaean</HI> Rage more fell</L>
<L>Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air</L>
<L>In Whirlwind; Hell &s;carce holds the wild uproar.</L></Q></P>
<P>THEIR Mu&s;ick is employed in celebrating their own criminal Exploits, and their Di&s;cour&s;e in &s;ound|ing the unfathomable Depths of Fate, Free-will, and Fore-knowledge.</P>
<P>THE &s;everal Circum&s;tances in the De&s;cription of Hell are finely imagined; as the four Rivers which di&s;gorge them&s;elves into the Sea of Fire, the Ex|treams of Cold and Heat, and the River of Obli|vion. The mon&s;trous Animals produced in that infernal World are repre&s;ented by a &s;ingle Line, which gives us a more horrid Idea of them, than a much longer De&s;cription would have done. <Q><L>&mdash;Nature breeds,</L>
<L>Perver&s;e, all mon&s;trous, all prodigious Things,</L>
<L>Abominable, inutterable, and <HI>wor&s;e</HI></L>
<L><HI>Than Fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd,</HI></L>
<L>Gorgons, and Hydra's, and Chimera's dire.</L></Q></P>
<P>THIS Epi&s;ode of the fallen Spirits, and their Place of Habitation, comes in very happily to un|bend the Mind of the Reader from its Attention to the Debate. An ordinary Poet would indeed have &s;pun out &s;o many Circum&s;tances to a great Length, and by that Means have weakned, in&s;tead of illu|&s;trated, the principal Fable.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="54">
THE Flight of Satan to the Gates of Hell is finely imaged.</P>
<P>I have already declared my Opinion of the Alle|gory concerning <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death,</HI> which is however a very fini&s;hed Piece in its Kind, when it is not con|&s;idered as a Part of an Epic Poem. The Genealo|gy of the &s;everal Per&s;ons is contrived with great De|licacy. <HI>Sin</HI> is the Daughter of <HI>Satan,</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> the Offspring of <HI>Sin.</HI> The ince&s;tuous Mixture between <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> produces tho&s;e Mon&s;ters and Hell|hounds which from Time to Time enter into their Mother, and tear the Bowels of her who gave them Birth. The&s;e are the Terrors of an evil Con&s;cience, and the proper Fruits of <HI>Sin,</HI> which naturally ri&s;e from the Apprehen&s;ions of <HI>Death.</HI> This la&s;t beau|tiful Moral is, I think, clearly intimated in the Speech of <HI>Sin,</HI> where complaining of this her dread|ful I&s;&s;ue, &s;he adds, <Q><L><HI>Before mine Eyes in Oppo&s;ition &s;its,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Grim</HI> Death <HI>thy Son and Foe who &s;ets them on.</HI></L>
<L>And me his Parent would full &s;oon devour</L>
<L>For want of other Prey, but that he knows</L>
<L>His End with mine involv'd&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>I need not mention to the Reader the beautiful Circum&s;tance in the la&s;t Part of this Quotation. He will likewi&s;e ob&s;erve how naturally the three Per|&s;ons concerned in this Allegory are tempted by one common Intere&s;t to enter into a Confederacy together, and how properly <HI>Sin</HI> is made the Por|tre&s;s of Hell, and the only Being that can open the Gates to that World of Tortures.</P>
<P>THE de&s;criptive Part of this Allegory is likewi&s;e very &s;trong, and full of &s;ublime Ideas. The Figure of <HI>Death,</HI> the Regal Crown upon his Head, his Menace of <HI>Satan,</HI> his advancing to the Combat, the Outcry at his Birth, are Circum&s;tances too noble
<PB N="56" REF="55" MS="y">
to be pa&s;t over in Silence, and extreamly &s;uitable to this <HI>King of Terrors.</HI> I need not Mention the Ju&s;tne&s;s of Thought which is ob&s;erved in the Ge|neration of the&s;e &s;everal Symbolical Per&s;ons, that <HI>Sin</HI> was produced upon the fir&s;t Revolt of <HI>Satan,</HI> that <HI>Death</HI> appeared &s;oon after he was ca&s;t into Hell, and that the Terrors of Con&s;cience were con|ceived at the Gate of this Place of Torments. The De&s;cription of the Gates is very poetical, as the o|pening of them is full of <HI>Milton</HI>'s Spirit. <Q><L>&mdash;ON a &s;udden open fly</L>
<L>With impetuous recoil and jarring &s;ound</L>
<L>Th' infernal Doors, and on their Hinges grate</L>
<L>Har&s;h Thunder, that the lowe&s;t bottom &s;hook,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Erebus.</HI> She open'd, but to &s;hut</L>
<L>Excell'd her Power; the Gates wide open &s;tood,</L>
<L>That with extended Wings a banner'd Ho&s;t</L>
<L>&V;nder &s;pread En&s;igns marching might pa&s;s through</L>
<L>With Hor&s;e and Chariots rank'd in loo&s;e array;</L>
<L>So wide they &s;tood, and like a Furnace Mouth</L>
<L>Ca&s;t forth redounding Smoak and ruddy Flame.</L></Q></P>
<P>IN Satan's Voyage through the Chaos there are &s;everal imaginary Per&s;ons de&s;cribed, as re&s;iding in that immen&s;e Wa&s;te of Matter. This may perhaps be conformable to the Ta&s;te of tho&s;e Criticks who are plea&s;ed with Nothing in a Poet which has not Life and Manners a&s;cribed to it; but for my own Part, I am plea&s;ed mo&s;t with tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages in this De&s;cription which carry in them a greater Mea&s;ure of Probability, and are &s;uch as might po&s;&s;ibly have happened. Of this Kind is his fir&s;t Mounting in the Smoak, that ri&s;es from the infernal Pit, his fal|ling into a Cloud of Nitre, and the like combu|&s;tible Materials, that by their Explo&s;ion &s;till hur|ried him forward in his Voyage; his &s;pringing up|ward like a Pyramid of Fire, with his laborious
<PB N="57" REF="56" MS="y">
Pa&s;&s;age through that Confu&s;ion of Elements, which the Poet calls <Q><L>The Womb of Nature and perhaps her Grave.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Glimmering Light which &s;hot into the <HI>Chaos</HI> from the utmo&s;t Verge of the Creation, with the di&s;tant Di&s;covery of the Earth that hung clo&s;e by the Moon, are wonderfully beautiful and poe|tical.</P>

<P><PB N="58" REF="57">
IF <HI>Milton</HI>'s Maje&s;ty for&s;akes him any where, it is in tho&s;e Parts of his Poem, where the Divine Per&s;ons are introduced as Speakers. One may, I think, ob&s;erve that the Author proceeds with a Kind of Fear and Trembling, whil&s;t he de&s;cribes the Sentiments of the Almighty. He dares not give his Imagination its full Play, but chu&s;es to confine him&s;elf to &s;uch Thoughts as are drawn from the Books of the mo&s;t Orthodox Divines, and to &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as may be met with in Scripture. The Beauties, therefore, which we are to look for in the&s;e Speeches, are not of a poetical Nature, nor &s;o proper to fill the Mind with Sentiments of Grandeur, as with Thoughts of Devotion. The Pa&s;|&s;ions, which they are de&s;igned to rai&s;e, are a Di|vine Love and Religious Fear. The particular Beau|ty of the Speeches in the Third Book, con&s;i&s;ts in that Shortne&s;s and Per&s;picuity of Stile, in which the Poet has couched the greate&s;t My&s;teries of Chri&s;ti|anity, and drawn together, in a regular Scheme, the whole Di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence, with re&s;pect to Man. He has repre&s;ented all the ab&s;tru&s;e Doctrines of Prede&s;tination, Free-Will and Grace, as al&s;o the great Points of Incarnation and Redemption, (which naturally grow up in a Poem that treats of the Fall of Man,) with great Energy of Expre&s;&s;ion, and in a clearer and &s;tronger Light than I ever met with in any other Writer. As the&s;e Points are dry in them&s;elves to the Generality of Readers, the con|ci&s;e and clear Manner in which he has treated them is very much to be admired, as is likewi&s;e that par|ticular Art which he has made u&s;e of, in the in|ter&s;per&s;ing of all tho&s;e Graces of Poetry, which the Subject was capable of receiving.</P>
<P>THE Survey of the whole Creation, and of eve|ry Thing that is tran&s;acted in it, is a Pro&s;pect wor|thy of Omni&s;cience; and as much above that, in which <HI>Virgil</HI> has drawn his <HI>Jupiter,</HI> as the Chri&s;tian
<PB N="59" REF="58" MS="y">
Idea of the Supream Being is more Rational and Sublime than that of the Heathens. The particular Objects on which he is de&s;cribed to have ca&s;t his Eye, are repre&s;ented in the mo&s;t beautiful and lively Manner. <Q><L>Now had th' Almighty Father from above,</L>

<P><HI>SATAN</HI>'s Approach to the Confines of the Creation, is finely imaged in the Beginning of the Speech, which immediately follows. The Effects of this Speech in the ble&s;&s;ed Spirits, and in the divine Per&s;on to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, cannot but fill the Mind of the Reader with a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure and Complacency. <Q><PB N="60" REF="59">
<L>Thus while God &s;pake, ambro&s;ial Fragrance fill'd</L>

<P>I need not Point out the Beauty of that Circum|&s;tance, wherein the whole Ho&s;t of Angels are repre|&s;ented as &s;tanding mute; nor &s;how how proper the Occa&s;ion was to produce &s;uch a Silence in Heaven. The Clo&s;e of this Divine Colloquy, with the Hymn of Angels that follows upon it, are &s;o wonderfully beautiful and poetical, that I &s;hould not forbear in|&s;erting the whole Pa&s;&s;age, if the Bounds of my Pa|per would give me leave. <Q><L>No &s;ooner had th' Almighty ceas'd, but all</L>

<P><HI>SATAN</HI>'s Walk upon the Out&s;ide of the Uni|ver&s;e, which, at a Di&s;tance appeared to him of a Globular Form, but, upon his nearer Approach, look|ed like an unbounded Plain, is natural and noble. As his Roaming upon the Frontiers of the Creati|on, between that Ma&s;s of Matter, which was wrought into a World, and that &s;hapele&s;s unformed Heap of Materials, which &s;till lay in Chaos and Confu&s;ion, &s;trikes the Imagination with &s;omething a&s;toni&s;hing|ly great and wild. I have before &s;poken of the <HI>Limbo of Vanity,</HI> which the Poet places upon this outer|mo&s;t Surface of the Univer&s;e, and &s;hall here explain
<PB N="61" REF="60">
my &s;elf more at large on that, and other Parts of the Poem, which are of the &s;ame &s;hadowy Nature.</P>
<P><HI>ARISTOTLE</HI> ob&s;erves, that the Fable of an Epic Poem &s;hould abound in Circum&s;tances that are both credible and a&s;toni&s;hing; or, as the <HI>French</HI> Cri|ticks chu&s;e to phra&s;e it, the Fable &s;hould be filled with the Probable and the Marvellous. This Rule is as fine and ju&s;t as any in <HI>Ari&s;tole</HI>'s whole Art of Poetry.</P>
<P>IF the Fable is only probable, it differs Nothing from a true Hi&s;tory; if it is only marvellous, it is no better than a Romance. The great Secret there|fore of Heroick Poetry, is to relate &s;uch Circum|&s;tances, as may produce in the Reader at the &s;ame Time both Belief and A&s;toni&s;hment. This is brought to pa&s;s in a <HI>well cho&s;en</HI> Fable, by the Account of &s;uch Things as have really happened, or at lea&s;t of &s;uch Things as have happened according to the re|ceived Opinions of Mankind. <HI>Milton</HI>'s Fable is a Ma&s;ter-piece of this Nature; as the War in Heaven, the Condition of the fallen Angels, the State of In|nocence, the Temptation of the Serpent, and the Fall of Man, though they are very a&s;toni&s;hing in them&s;elves, are not only credible, but actual Points of Faith.</P>
<P>THE next Method of reconciling Miracles with Credibility, is by a happy Invention of the Poet; as in particular, when he introduces Agents of a &s;upe|rior Nature, who are capable of effecting what is wonderful, and what is not to be met with in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Things. <HI>&V;ly&s;&s;es</HI>'s Ship being turn'd into a Rock, and <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s Fleet into a Shoal of Water Nymphs, though they are very &s;urpri&s;ing Accidents, are neverthele&s;s probable, when we are told that they were the Gods who thus transform|ed them. It is this Kind of Machinery which fills the Poems both of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> with &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances as are wonderful, but not impo&s;&s;ible, and
<PB N="62" REF="61">
&s;o frequently produce in the Reader the mo&s;t plea|&s;ing Pa&s;&s;ion that can ri&s;e in the Mind of Man, which is Admiration. If there be any In&s;tance in the <HI>Ae|neid</HI> liable to Exception upon this Account, it is in the Beginning of the Third Book, where <HI>Aeneas</HI> is repre&s;ented as tearing up the Myrtle that dropped Blood. To qualifie this wonderful Circum&s;tance, <HI>Polydorus</HI> tells a Story from the Root of the Myrtle, that the barbarous Inhabitants of the Country ha|ving pierced him with Spears and Arrows, the Wood which was left in his Body took Root in his Wounds, and gave Birth to that bleeding Tree. This Cir|cum&s;tance &s;eems to have the Marvellous without the Probable, becau&s;e it is repre&s;ented as proceeding from natural Cau&s;es, without the Interpo&s;ition of a|ny God, or rather &s;upernatural Power capable of pro|ducing it: The Spears and Arrows grow of them|&s;elves, without &s;o much as the modern Help of an Enchantment. If we look into the Fiction of <HI>Mil|ton</HI>'s Fable, though we find it full of &s;urpri&s;ing Inci|dents, they are generally &s;uited to our Notions of the Things and Per&s;ons de&s;cribed, and tempered with a due Mea&s;ure of Probability. I mu&s;t only make an Exception to the <HI>Limbo of Vanity,</HI> with his Epi&s;ode of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death,</HI> and &s;ome of the ima|ginary Per&s;ons in his <HI>Chaos.</HI> The&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages are a|&s;toni&s;hing, but not credible; the Reader cannot &s;o far impo&s;e upon him&s;elf as to &s;ee a Po&s;&s;ibility in them; they are the De&s;cription of Dreams and Sha|dows, not of Things or Per&s;ons. I know that many Criticks look upon the Stories of <HI>Circe, Polyphemt,</HI> the <HI>Sirens,</HI> nay the whole <HI>Odi&s;&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Iliad</HI> to be Al|legories; but allowing this to be true, they are Fa|bles, which con&s;idering the Opinions of Mankind that prevailed in the Age of the Poets, might po&s;|&s;ibly have been according to the Letter. The Per|&s;ons are &s;uch as might have acted what is a&s;cribed to them, as the Circum&s;tances, in which they are
<PB N="63" REF="62">
repre&s;ented, might po&s;&s;ibly have been Truths and Realities. This Appearance of Probability is &s;o ab|&s;olutely requi&s;ite in the greater Kinds of Poetry, that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> ob&s;erves the ancient Tragick Writers made u&s;e of the Names of &s;uch great Men as had actually lived in the World, tho' the Tragedy pro|ceeded upon Adventures they were never engaged in, on Purpo&s;e to make the Subject more credible. In a Word, be&s;ides the hidden Meaning of an Epic Al|legory, the plain literal Sen&s;e ought to appear proba|ble. The Story &s;hould be &s;uch as an ordinary Rea|der may acquie&s;ce in, whatever natural, moral, or political Truth may be di&s;covered in it by Men of greater Penetration.</P>
<P><HI>SATAN</HI> after having long wandred upon the Surface, or outmo&s;t Wall of the Univer&s;e, di&s;covers at la&s;t a wide Gap in it, which led into the Crea|tion, and is de&s;cribed as the Opening through which the Angels pa&s;s to and fro into the lower World, upon their Errands to Mankind. His Sitting upon the Brink of this Pa&s;&s;age, and taking a Survey of the whole Face of Nature, that appeared to him new and fre&s;h in all its Beauties, with the Simile illu&s;trating this Circum&s;tance, fills the Mind of the Reader with as &s;urpri&s;ing and glorious an I|dea as any that ari&s;es in the whole Poem. He looks down into that va&s;t Hollow of the Univer&s;e with the Eye, or (as <HI>Milton</HI> calls it in his fir&s;t Book) with the Kenn of an Angel. He &s;urveys all the Wonders in this immen&s;e Amphitheatre that lye between both the Poles of Heaven, and takes in at one View the whole Round of the Crea|tion.</P>
<P>HIS Flight between the &s;everal Worlds that &s;hin|ed on every Side of him, with the particular De|&s;cription of the Sun, are &s;et forth in all the Wan|tonne&s;s of a luxuriant Imagination. His Shape, Speech and Behaviour upon his transforming him&s;elf
<PB N="64" REF="63">
into an Angel of Light, are touched with exqui|&s;ite Beauty. The Poet's Thought of directing <HI>Sa|tan</HI> to the Sun, which in the Vulgar Opinion of Mankind is the mo&s;t con&s;picuous Part of the Cre|ation, and the placing in it an Angel, is a Circum|&s;tance very finely contrived, and the more adju|&s;ted to a poetical Probability, as it was a received Doctrine among the mo&s;t famous Philo&s;ophers, that every Orb had its <HI>Intelligence;</HI> and as an Apo&s;tle in &s;acred Writ is &s;aid to have &s;een &s;uch an Angel in the Sun. In the An&s;wer which this Angel returns to the di&s;gui&s;ed Evil Spirit, there is &s;uch a beco|ming Maje&s;ty as is altogether &s;uitable to a &s;uperi|or Being. The Part of it in which he repre&s;ents him&s;elf as pre&s;ent at the Creation, is very noble in it &s;elf, and not only proper where it is introduced, but requi&s;ite to prepare the Reader for what fol|lows in the Seventh Book. <Q><L>I &s;aw when at his Word the formle&s;s Ma&s;s,</L>
<L>This World's Material Mould, came to a Heap:</L>
<L>Confu&s;ion heard his Voice, and wild uproar</L>
<L>Stood rul'd, &s;tood va&s;t infinitude confin'd;</L>
<L>Till at his &s;econd bidding Darkne&s;s fled,</L>
<L>Light &s;hon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>IN the following Part of the Speech he points out the Earth with &s;uch Circum&s;tances, that the Reader can &s;carce forbear fancying him&s;elf employ|ed on the &s;ame di&s;tant View of it. <Q><L>Look downward on the Globe who&s;e hither Side</L>
<L>With light from hence, tho' but reflected, &s;hines;</L>
<L>That Place is Earth, the Seat of Man, that light</L>
<L>His day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t not conclude my Reflections upon this third Book of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> without taking Notice
<PB N="65" REF="64" MS="y">
of that celebrated Complaint of <HI>Milton</HI> with which it opens, and which certainly de&s;erves all the Prai|&s;es that have been given it; tho' as I have before hinted, it may rather be looked upon as an Ex|cre&s;cence, than as an e&s;&s;ential Part of the Poem. The &s;ame Ob&s;ervation might be applied to that beautiful Digre&s;&s;ion upon Hypocri&s;ie, in the &s;ame Book.</P>

<Q><L>Nec &s;atis e&s;t pulchra e&s;&s;e poemata, dulcia &s;unto.</L><BIBL>Hor.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THOSE, who know how many Volumes have been written on the Poems of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Vir|gil,</HI> will ea&s;ily pardon the Length of my Di&s;cour&s;e upon <HI>Milton. The Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> is looked upon, by the be&s;t Judges, as the greate&s;t Production, or at lea&s;t the noble&s;t Work of Genius, in our Lan|guage, and therefore de&s;erves to be &s;et before an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader in its full Beauty. For this Rea|&s;on, tho' I have endeavoured to give a general I|dea of its Graces and Imperfections in my &s;ix fir&s;t Papers, I thought my &s;elf obliged to be&s;tow one upon every Book in particular. The Three fir&s;t Books I have already di&s;patched, and am now en|tring upon the Fourth. I need not acquaint my Reader, that there are Multitudes of Beauties in this great Author, e&s;pecially in the de&s;criptive Parts of his Poem, which I have not touched upon; it being my Intention to point out tho&s;e only, which appear to me the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite, or tho&s;e which are not &s;o obvious to ordinary Readers. Every one that has read the Criticks, who have written upon
<PB N="66" REF="65">
the <HI>Odi&s;&s;y,</HI> the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> knows very well, that though they agree in their Opinions of the great Beauties in tho&s;e Poems, they have ne|verthele&s;s each of them di&s;covered &s;everal Ma&s;ter-Strokes, which have e&s;caped the Ob&s;ervation of the re&s;t. In the &s;ame Manner, I que&s;tion not, but any Writer, who &s;hall treat on this Subject after me, may find &s;everal Beauties in <HI>Milton,</HI> which I have not taken notice of. I mu&s;t likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that as the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters of critical Learning differ among one another, as to &s;ome particular Points in an Epic Poem, I have not bound my &s;elf &s;crupulou&s;ly to the Rules which any one of them has laid down upon that Art, but have taken the Liberty &s;ometimes to join with one, and &s;ome|times with another, and &s;ometimes to differ from all of them, when I have thought that the Rea&s;on of the Thing was on my Side.</P>
<P>WE may con&s;ider the Beauties of the Fourth Book under three Heads. In the fir&s;t are tho&s;e Pictures of Still-Life, which we meet with in the De&s;crip|tions of <HI>Eden, Paradi&s;e, Adam</HI>'s Bower, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the next are the Machines, which comprehend the Speeches and Behaviour of the good and bad An|gels. In the la&s;t is the Conduct of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> who are the principal Actors in the Poem.</P>
<P>IN the De&s;cription of <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> the Poet has ob|&s;erved <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Rule of lavi&s;hing all the Orna|ments of Diction on the weak unactive Parts of the Fable, which are not &s;upported by the Beauty of Sentiments and Characters. Accordingly the Rea|der may ob&s;erve, that the Expre&s;&s;ions are more flo|rid and elaborate in the&s;e De&s;criptions, than in mo&s;t other Parts of the Poem. I mu&s;t further add, that tho' the <HI>Drawings</HI> of Gardens, Rivers, Rain|bows, and the like dead Pieces of Nature, are ju&s;tly cen&s;ured in an heroic Poem, when they run out into an unnece&s;&s;ary Length; the De&s;cription of
<PB N="67" REF="66">
<HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> would have been faulty, had not the Poet been very particular in it, not only as it is the Scene of the principal Action, but as it is requi|&s;ite to give us an Idea of that Happine&s;s from which our fir&s;t Parents fell. The Plan of it is won|derfully beautiful, and formed upon the &s;hort Sketch which we have of it, in Holy Writ. <HI>Milton</HI>'s Exu|berance of Imagination has poured forth &s;uch a Redundancy of Ornaments on this Seat of Happi|ne&s;s and Innocence, that it would be endle&s;s to point out each Particular.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not quit this Head, without further ob&s;er|ving, that there is &s;carce a Speech of <HI>Adam</HI> or <HI>Eve</HI> in the whole Poem, wherein the Sentiments and Allu&s;ions are not taken from this their delight|ful Habitation. The Reader, during their whole Cour&s;e of Action, always finds him&s;elf in the Walks of <HI>Paradi&s;e.</HI> In &s;hort, as the Criticks have remar|ked, that in tho&s;e Poems, wherein Shepherds are Actors, the Thoughts ought always to take a Tin|cture from the Woods, Fields and Rivers; &s;o we may ob&s;erve, that our fir&s;t Parents &s;eldom lo&s;e Sight of their happy Station in any Thing they &s;peak or do; and, if the Reader will give me Leave to u&s;e the Expre&s;&s;ion, that their Thoughts are always <HI>paradi&s;iacal.</HI></P>
<P>WE are in the next Place to con&s;ider the Ma|chines of the Fourth Book. <HI>Satan</HI> being now with|in Pro&s;pect of <HI>Eden,</HI> and looking round upon the Glories of the Creation, is filled with Sentiments different from tho&s;e which he di&s;covered whil&s;t he was in Hell. The Place in&s;pires him with Thoughts more adapted to it: He reflects upon the happy Condition from whence he fell, and breaks forth into a Speech that is &s;oftned with &s;everal tran&s;ient Touches of Remor&s;e and Self-Accu&s;ation: But at length, he confirms him&s;elf in Impenitence, and in his De&s;ign of drawing Men into his own State
<PB N="68" REF="67">
of Guilt and Mi&s;ery. This Conflict of Pa&s;&s;ions is rai&s;ed with a great deal of Art, as the Opening of his Speech to the Sun is very bold and noble. <Q><L>O thou that with &s;urpa&s;&s;ing Glory crown'd</L>
<L>Look'&s;t from thy &s;ole Dominion like the God</L>
<L>Of this new World, at who&s;e Sight all the Stars</L>
<L>Hide their dimini&s;h'd Heads, to thee I call</L>
<L>But with no friendly Voice, and add thy Name</L>
<L>O <HI>Sun,</HI> to tell thee how I hate thy Beams</L>
<L>That bring to my Remembrance from what State</L>
<L>I fell, how glorious once above thy Sphere.</L></Q></P>
<P>THIS Speech is, I think, the fine&s;t that is a&s;cri|bed to <HI>Satan</HI> in the whole Poem. The Evil Spirit afterwards proceeds to make his Di&s;coveries con|cerning our fir&s;t Parents, and to learn after what Manner they may be be&s;t attacked. His bounding over the Walls of <HI>Paradi&s;e;</HI> his &s;itting in the Shape of a Cormorant upon the Tree of Life, which &s;tood in the Center of it, and over-topped all the other Trees of the Garden; his alighting among the Herd of Animals, which are &s;o beautifully re|pre&s;ented as playing about <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve;</HI> toge|ther with his transforming him&s;elf into different Shapes, in order to hear their Conver&s;ation; are Cir|cum&s;tances that give an agreeable Surprize to the Reader, and are devi&s;ed with great Art, to connect that Series of Adventures in which the Poet has engaged this great Artificer of Fraud.</P>
<P>THE Thought of <HI>Saian</HI>'s Transformation into a Cormorant, and placing him&s;elf on the Tree of Life, &s;eems rai&s;ed upon that Pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Ilaid,</HI> where two Deities are de&s;cribed, as perching on the Top of an Oak in the Shape of Vulturs.</P>
<P>HIS planting him&s;elf at the Ear of <HI>Eve</HI> under the Form of a Toad, in order to produce vain Dreams and Imaginations, is a Circum&s;tance of
<PB N="69" REF="68">
the &s;ame Nature; as his &s;tarting up in his own Form is wonderfully fine, both in the literal De|&s;cription, and in the Moral which is concealed un|der it. His An&s;wer upon his being di&s;covered, and demanded to give an Account of him&s;elf, is con|formable to the Pride and Intrepidity of his Cha|racter. <Q><L>Know ye not then, &s;aid <HI>Satan,</HI> fill'd with Scorn,</L>
<L>Know ye not Me? ye knew me once ne Mate</L>
<L>For You, there &s;itting where you dur&s;t not &s;oare;</L>
<L>Not to know Me argues your-&s;elves unknown,</L>
<L>The lowe&s;t of your throng;&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>ZEPHON</HI>'s Rebuke, with the Influence it had on <HI>Satan,</HI> is exqui&s;itely graceful and moral. <HI>Sa|tan</HI> is afterwards led away to <HI>Gabriel,</HI> the chief of the guardian Angels, who kept Watch in <HI>Paradi&s;e.</HI> His di&s;dainful Behaviour on this Occa&s;ion is &s;o re|markable a Beauty, that the mo&s;t ordinary Reader cannot but take Notice of it. <HI>Gabriel</HI>'s di&s;covering his Approach at a Di&s;tance, is drawn with great Strength and Liveline&s;s of Imagination. <Q><L>O Friends, I hear the tread of nimble Feet</L>
<L>Ha&s;t'ning this Way, and now by glimps di&s;cern</L>
<L><HI>Ithuriel</HI> and <HI>Zephon</HI> through the &s;hade;</L>
<L>And with them comes a third of regal Port,</L>
<L>But faded &s;plendor wan; who by his gait</L>
<L>And fierce demeanor &s;eems the Prince of Hell,</L>
<L>Not likely to part hence without conte&s;t;</L>
<L>Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Conference between <HI>Gabriel</HI> and <HI>Satan</HI> a|bounds with Sentiments proper for the Occa&s;ion, and &s;uitable to the Per&s;ons of the two Speakers. <HI>Satan</HI>'s cloathing him&s;elf with Terror, when he Prepares for the Combat, is truly &s;ublime, and at
<PB N="70" REF="69">
lea&s;t equal to <HI>Homer</HI>'s De&s;cription of Di&s;cord cele|brated by <HI>Longinus,</HI> or to that of Fame in <HI>Virgil,</HI> who are both repre&s;ented with their Feet &s;tanding upon the Earth, and their Heads reaching above the Clouds. <Q><L>While thus he &s;pake, th' Angelic Squadron bright</L>
<L>Turn'd fiery red, &s;harpning in mooned Horns</L>
<L>Their Phalanx, and began to hem him round</L>
<L>With ported Spears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L>
<L>&mdash;On th' other Side, <HI>Satan</HI> alarm'd,</L>
<L>Collecting all his might dilated &s;tood</L>
<L>Like <HI>Teneriff</HI> or <HI>Atlas</HI> unremov'd.</L>
<L>His Stature reach'd the Sky, and on his Cre&s;t</L>
<L>Sat horrour plum'd;&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t here take notice, that <HI>Milton</HI> is every where full of Hints, and &s;ometimes literal Tran&s;|lations, taken from the greate&s;t of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Poets. But this I may re&s;erve for a Di&s;cour&s;e by it &s;elf, becau&s;e I would not break the Thread of the&s;e Speculations, that are de&s;igned for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Readers, with &s;uch Reflections as would be of no U&s;e but to the Learned.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t however ob&s;erve in this Place, that the breaking off the Combat between <HI>Gabriel</HI> and <HI>Sa|tan,</HI> by the hanging out of the golden Scales in Heaven, is a Refinement upon <HI>Homer</HI>'s Thought, who tells us, that before the Battle between <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Achilles, Jupiter</HI> weighed the Event of it in a Pair of Scales. The Reader may &s;ee the whole Pa&s;|&s;age in the 22d <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P><HI>VIRGIL,</HI> before the la&s;t deci&s;ive Combat, de|&s;cribes <HI>Jupiter</HI> in the &s;ame Manner, as weighing the Fates of <HI>Turnus</HI> and <HI>Aeneas. Milton,</HI> though he fetched this beautiful Circum&s;tance from the <HI>Iliad</HI> and <HI>Aeneid,</HI> does not only in&s;ert it as a poetical Embelli&s;hment, like the Authors above-mentioned;
<PB N="71" REF="70">
but makes an artful U&s;e of it for the proper carry|ing on of his Fable, and for the breaking off the Combat between the two Warriors, who were upon the Point of engaging. To this we may further add, that <HI>Milton</HI> is the more ju&s;tified in this Pa&s;&s;age, as we find the &s;ame noble Allegory in Holy Writ, where a wicked Prince, &s;ome few Hours before he was a&s;&s;aulted and &s;lain, is &s;aid to have been <HI>weigh'd in the Scales, and to have been found wanting.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t here take Notice under the Head of the Machines, that <HI>&V;riel</HI>'s gliding down to the Earth upon a Sun-beam, with the Poet's Device to make him <HI>de&s;cend,</HI> as well in his Return to the Sun, as in his coming from it, is a Prettine&s;s that might have been admired in a little fanciful Poet, but &s;eems below the Genius of <HI>Milton.</HI> The De&s;cription of the Ho&s;t of armed Angels walking their nightly Round in <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> is of another Spirit;
<Q><L>So &s;aying, on he led his radiant files,</L>
<L>Dazling the Moon;</L></Q>
as that Account of the Hymns, which our fir&s;t Parents u&s;ed to hear them &s;ing in the&s;e their Mid|night-Walks, is altogether Divine, and inexpre&s;&s;ibly amu&s;ing to the Imagination.</P>
<P>WE are, in the la&s;t Place, to con&s;ider the Parts which <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> act in the fourth Book. The De&s;cription of them as they fir&s;t appeared to <HI>Sa|tan,</HI> is exqui&s;itely drawn, and &s;ufficient to make the fallen Angel gaze upon them with all that A&s;to|ni&s;hment, and tho&s;e Emotions of Envy, in which he is repre&s;ented. <Q><L>Two of far nobler Shape erect and tall,</L>
<L>God-like erect, with native honour clad</L>
<L>In naked Maje&s;ty &s;eem'd lords of all,</L>
<L>And worthy &s;eem'd, for in their looks Divine</L>
<L><PB N="72" REF="71">
The Image of their glorious Maker &s;hon,</L>
<L>Truth, Wi&s;dom, Sanctitude &s;evere and pure;</L>
<L>Severe, but in true filial Freedom plac'd:</L>
<L>For Contemplation he and valour form'd,</L>
<L>For &s;oftne&s;s &s;he and &s;weet attractive Grace;</L>
<L>He for God only, &s;he for God in him:</L>
<L>His fair large Front, and Eye &s;ublime declar'd</L>
<L>Ab&s;olute Rule; and <HI>Hyacinthin</HI> Locks</L>
<L>Round from his parted forelock manly hung</L>
<L>Clu&s;tring, but not beneath his Shoulders broad;</L>
<L>She as a Vail down to her &s;lender Wa&s;te</L>
<L>Her unadorned golden Tre&s;&s;es wore</L>
<L>Di&s;-&s;hevel'd, but in wanton Ringlets wav'd.</L>
<L>So pa&s;s'd they naked on, nor &s;hun'd the Sight</L>
<L>Of God or Angel, for they Thought no ill:</L>
<L>So Hand in Hand they pa&s;s'd, the lovelie&s;t Pair</L>
<L>That ever &s;ince in love's Embraces met.</L></Q></P>
<P>THERE is a fine Spirit of Poetry in the Lines which follow, wherein they are de&s;cribed as &s;itting on a Bed of Flowers by the Side of a Fountain, a|mid&s;t a mixed A&s;&s;embly of Animals.</P>
<P>THE Speeches of the&s;e two fir&s;t Lovers flow e|qually from Pa&s;&s;ion and Sincerity. The Profe&s;&s;ions they make to one another are full of Warmth; but at the &s;ame Time founded on Truth. In a Word, they are the Gallantries of <HI>Paradi&s;e.</HI> <Q><LG>
<L>&mdash;When <HI>Adam</HI> fir&s;t of Men&mdash;</L>
<L>Sole Partner and &s;ole Part of all the&s;e Joys</L>
<L>Dearer thy &s;elf than all;&mdash;</L>
<L>But let us ever prai&s;e him, and extol</L>
<L>His bounty, following our delightful task,</L>
<L>To prune tho&s;e growing plants, and tend the&s;e flowers,</L>
<L>Which were it toil&s;ome, yet with thee were &s;weet.</L>
</LG> <LG>
<L>To whom thus <HI>Eve</HI> reply'd, O thou for whom</L>
<L>And from whom I was form'd, Fle&s;h of thy Fle&s;h,</L>
<L>And without whom am to no end, my Guide</L>
<L><PB N="73" REF="72">
And Head, what thou ha&s;t &s;aid is ju&s;t and right.</L>
<L>For we to him indeed all Prai&s;es owe,</L>
<L>And daily Thanks, I chiefly who enjoy</L>
<L>So far the happier Lot, enjoying thee</L>
<L>Praeeminent by &s;o much odds, while thou</L>
<L>Like Con&s;ort to thy &s;elf can&s;t no where find, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>THE remaining Part of <HI>Eve</HI>'s Speech, in which &s;he gives an Account of her &s;elf upon her fir&s;t Cre|ation, and the Manner in which &s;he was brought to <HI>Adam,</HI> is I think as beautiful a Pa&s;&s;age as any in <HI>Milton,</HI> or perhaps in any other Poet what&s;oever. The&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages are all worked off with &s;o much Art, that they are capable of plea&s;ing the mo&s;t delicate Reader, without offending the mo&s;t &s;evere. <Q><L>That Day I oft remember, when from Sleep, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>A Poet of le&s;s Judgment and Invention than this great Author, would have found it very difficult to have filled the&s;e tender Parts of the Poem with Sentiments proper for a State of Innocence; to have de&s;cribed the Warmth of Love, and the Pro|fe&s;&s;ions of it, without Artifice or Hyperbole; to have made the Man &s;peak the mo&s;t endearing Things, without de&s;cending from his natural Dig|nity, and the Woman receiving them without De|parting from the Mode&s;ty of her Character; in a Word, to adju&s;t the Prerogatives of Wi&s;dom and Beauty, and make each appear to the other in its proper Force and Loveline&s;s. This mutual Subor|dination of the two Sexes is wonderfully kept up in the whole Poem, as particularly in the Speech of <HI>Eve</HI> I have before-mentioned, and upon the Con|clu&s;ion of it in the following Lines; <Q><L>So &s;pake our general Mother, and with Eyes</L>
<L>Of conjugal Attraction unreprov'd,</L>
<L><PB N="74" REF="73">
And meek &s;urrender, half embracing lean'd</L>
<L>On our fir&s;t Father, half her &s;welling brea&s;t</L>
<L>Naked met his under the flowing Gold</L>
<L>Of her loo&s;e Tre&s;&s;es hid; he in Delight</L>
<L>Both of her Beauty and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Charms</L>
<L>Smil'd with Superior Love,&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Poet adds, that the Devil turned away with Envy at the Sight of &s;o much Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>WE have another View of our fir&s;t Parents in their evening Di&s;cour&s;es, which is full of plea&s;ing Images, and Sentiments &s;uitable to their Conditi|on and Characters. The Speech of <HI>Eve,</HI> in parti|cular, is dre&s;&s;ed up in &s;uch a &s;oft and natural Turn of Words and Sentiments, as cannot be &s;ufficient|ly admired.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e my Reflections upon this Book, with ob&s;erving the ma&s;terly Tran&s;ition which the Poet makes to their Evening Wor&s;hip, in the following Lines. <Q><L>Thus at their &s;hadie lodge arriv'd, both &s;tood,</L>
<L>Both turn'd, and under open Sky ador'd</L>
<L>The God that made both Sky, Air, Earth and Heav'n</L>
<L>Which they beheld, the Moons re&s;plendent Globe,</L>
<L>And Starry Pole: <HI>Thou al&s;o mad'&s;t the Night,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Maker omnipotent, and thou the Day,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>MOST of the modern heroic Poets have imita|ted the Ancients, in beginning a Speech without pre|mi&s;ing that the Per&s;on &s;aid thus or thus: but as it is ea&s;ie to imitate the Ancients in the Omi&s;&s;ion of two or three Words, it requires Judgment to do it in &s;uch a Manner as they &s;hall not be mi&s;&s;ed, and that the Speech may begin naturally without them. There is a fine In&s;tance of this Kind out of <HI>Homer,</HI> in the Twenty Third Chapter of <HI>Longinus.</HI></P>

<P>WE were told in the foregoing Book how the Evil Spirit practi&s;ed upon <HI>Eve</HI> as &s;he lay a&s;leep, in order to in&s;pire her with Thoughts of Vanity, Pride and Ambition.

<L>With Tre&s;&s;es di&s;compos'd, and glowing cheek</L>
<L>As through unquiet re&s;t: he on his &s;ide</L>
<L>Leaning half-rais'd, with looks of cordial love</L>
<L>Hung over her enamour'd, and beheld</L>
<L>Beauty which, whether waking or a&s;leep,</L>
<L>Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice</L>
<L>Mild, as when <HI>Zephyrus</HI> on <HI>Flora</HI> breathes,</L>
<L>Her Hand &s;oft touching, whi&s;per'd thus: Awake</L>
<L>My faire&s;t, my e&s;pous'd, my late&s;t found,</L>
<L>Heav'ns la&s;t be&s;t gift, my ever new delight,</L>
<L>Awake: the morning &s;hines, and the fre&s;h field</L>
<L>Calls us, we lo&s;e the prime to mark how &s;pring</L>
<L>Our tended plants, how blows the Citron Grove,</L>
<L><PB N="76" REF="75">
What drops the Myrrhe, and what the balmie Reed;</L>
<L>How Nature paints her colours; how the Bee</L>
<L>Sits on the bloom, extracting liquid &s;weet.</L>
<L>Such Whi&s;pering wak'd her, but with &s;tartled Eye</L>
<L>On <HI>Adam,</HI> whom embracing, thus &s;he &s;pake.</L>
<L>O Sole in whom my thoughts find all Repo&s;e,</L>
<L>My glory, my perfection, glad I &s;ee</L>
<L>Thy face, and morn return'd&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>I cannot but take Notice that <HI>Milton,</HI> in the Con|ferences between <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> had his Eye very frequently upon the Book of <HI>Canticles,</HI> in which there is a noble Spirit of Ea&s;tern Poetry, and very often not unlike what we meet with in <HI>Homer,</HI> who is generally placed near the Age of <HI>Solomon.</HI> I think there is no Que&s;tion but the Poet in the prece|ding Speech remember'd tho&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ages which are &s;poken on the like Occa&s;ion, and fill'd with the &s;ame plea&s;ing Images of Nature. <Q>MY beloved &s;pake, and &s;aid unto me, Ri&s;e up, my love, my fair one, and come away; For lo, the winter is pa&s;t, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the Earth; the time of the &s;inging of birds is come, and the Voice of the Turtle is heard in our Land. The fig-tree putteth forth her green figs, and the Vines with the tender grape give a good &s;mell. Ari&s;e, my Love, my fair one, and come away.</Q><Q>COME, my beloved, let us go forth into the Field; let us get up early to the Vineyards, let us &s;ee if the Vine flouri&s;h, whether the tender Grape appear, and the Pomegranates bud forth.</Q></P>
<P>HIS preferring the Garden of <HI>Eden</HI> to that
<Q><L>&mdash;Where the <HI>Sapient</HI> King</L>
<L>Held Dalliance with his fair <HI>Egyptian</HI> Spou&s;e,</L></Q>
<PB N="77" REF="76">
&s;hews that the Poet had this delightful Scene in his Mind.</P>
<P><HI>EVE</HI>'s Dream is full of tho&s;e <HI>high Conceits engen|dring Pride,</HI> which, we are told, the Devil endea|voured to in&s;till into her. Of this Kind is that Part of it where &s;he fancies her&s;elf awaken'd by <HI>A|dam</HI> in the following beautiful Lines. <Q><L>Why &s;leep'&s;t thou <HI>Eve?</HI> now is the plea&s;ant time,</L>
<L>The cool, the &s;ilent, &s;ave where &s;ilence yields</L>
<L>To the night-warbling bird, that now awake</L>
<L>Tunes &s;weete&s;t his love-labour'd &s;ong; now reigns</L>
<L>Full orb'd the moon, and with more plea&s;ing light</L>
<L>Shadowy &s;ets off the face of things: In vain</L>
<L>If none regard; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes.</L>
<L>Whom to behold but thee, Nature's de&s;ire,</L>
<L>In who&s;e &s;ight all things joy, with ravi&s;hment</L>
<L>Attracted by thy beauty &s;till to gaze!</L></Q></P>
<P>AN injudicious Poet would have made <HI>Adam</HI> talk thro' the whole Work, in &s;uch Sentiments as the&s;e. But Flattery and Fal&s;hood are not the Court|&s;hip of <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Adam,</HI> and could not be heard by <HI>Eve</HI> in her State of Innocence, excepting only in a Dream produc'd on purpo&s;e to taint her Imagina|tion. Other vain Sentiments of the &s;ame Kind in this Relation of her Dream, will be obvious to e|very Reader. Tho' the Cata&s;trophe of the Poem is finely pre&s;aged on this Occa&s;ion, the Particulars of it are &s;o artfully &s;hadow'd, that they do not anticipate the Story which follows in the Ninth Book. I &s;hall only add, that tho' the Vi&s;ion it &s;elf is founded upon Truth, the Circum&s;tances of it are full of that Wildne&s;s and Incon&s;i&s;tency which are natural to a Dream. <HI>Adam,</HI> conformable to his &s;uperior Character for Wi&s;dom, in&s;tructs and Comforts <HI>Eve</HI> upon this Occa&s;ion. <Q><PB N="78" REF="77">
<L>So chear'd he his fair Spou&s;e, and &s;he was chear'd,</L>

<L>Two other precious drops that ready &s;tood,</L>
<L>Each in their chry&s;tal &s;luice, he e'cr they fell</L>

<L>And pious awe, that fear'd to have offended.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Morning Hymn is written in Imitation of one of tho&s;e P&s;alms, where, in the Overflowings of Gratitude and Prai&s;e, the P&s;almi&s;t calls not only upon the Angels, but upon the mo&s;t con&s;picuous Parts of the inanimate Creation, to joyn with him in extolling their Common Maker. Invocations of this Nature fill the Mind with glorious Ideas of God's Works, and awaken that divine Euthu&s;i|a&s;m, which is &s;o natural to Devotion. But if this Calling upon the dead Parts of Nature is at all Times a proper Kind of Wor&s;hip, it was in a par|ticular Manner &s;uitable to our fir&s;t Parents, who had the Creation fre&s;h upon their Minds, and had not &s;een the various Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence, nor con&s;equently could be acquainted with tho&s;e many Topicks of Prai&s;e which might afford Mat|ter to the Devotions of their Po&s;terity. I need not remark the beautiful Spirit of Poetry, which runs through this whole Hymn, nor the Holine&s;s of that Re&s;olution with which it concludes.</P>
<P>HAVING already mentioned tho&s;e Speeches which are a&s;&s;igned to the Per&s;ons in this Poem, I proceed to the De&s;cription which the Poet gives of <HI>Raphael.</HI> His Departure from before the Throne, and his Flight thro' the Choirs of Angels, is fine|ly imaged. As <HI>Milton</HI> every where fills his Poem with Circum&s;tances that are marvellous and a&s;toni&s;h|ing, he de&s;cribes the Gate of Heaven as framed after &s;uch a Manner, that it open'd of it &s;elf upon the Approach of the Angel who was to pa&s;s through it. <Q><PB N="79" REF="78">
<L>&mdash;'till at the Gate</L>
<L>Of Heav'n arriv'd, the gate &s;elf-open'd wide,</L>
<L>On golden Hinges turning, as by work</L>
<L>Divine the Sovereign Architect had framed.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Poet here &s;eems to have regarded two or three Pa&s;&s;ages in the 18th <HI>Iliad,</HI> as that in particu|lar, where, &s;peaking of <HI>Vulcan, Homer</HI> &s;ays, that he had made twenty <HI>Tripodes</HI> running on Golden Wheels, which, upon Occa&s;ion, might go of them|&s;elves to the A&s;&s;embly of the Gods, and, when there was no more U&s;e for them, return again after the &s;ame Manner. <HI>Scaliger</HI> has rallied <HI>Homer</HI> very &s;e|verely upon this Point, as M. <HI>Dacier</HI> has endea|voured to defend it. I will not pretend to deter|mine, whether in this Particular of <HI>Homer,</HI> the Mar|vellous does not lo&s;e Sight of the Probable. As the miraculous Workman&s;hip of <HI>Milton</HI>'s Gates is not &s;o extraordinary as this of the <HI>Tripodes,</HI> &s;o I am per&s;uaded he would not have mentioned it, had not he been &s;upported in it by a Pa&s;&s;age in the Scripture, which &s;peaks of Wheels in Heav'n that had Life in them, and moved of them&s;elves, or &s;tood &s;till, in Conformity with the Cherubims, whom they accompanied.</P>
<P>THERE is no Que&s;tion but <HI>Milton</HI> had this Circum&s;tance in his Thoughts, becau&s;e in the fol|lowing Book he de&s;cribes the Chariot of the <HI>Me&s;|&s;iah</HI> with <HI>living</HI> Wheels, according to the Plan in <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s Vi&s;ion. <Q><L>&mdash;Forth ru&s;h'd with whirlwind &s;ound</L>
<L>The Chariot of Paternal Deity,</L>
<L>Fla&s;hing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn,</L>
<L>It &s;elf in&s;tinct with Spirit&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>I que&s;tion not but <HI>Bo&s;&s;u,</HI> and the two <HI>Daciers,</HI> who are for vindicating every Thing that is cen&s;ured
<PB N="80" REF="79">
in <HI>Homer,</HI> by &s;omething parallel in Holy Writ, would have been very well plea&s;ed had they thought of confronting <HI>Vulcan</HI>'s <HI>Tripodes</HI> with <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s Wheels.</P>
<P><HI>RAPHAEL</HI>'s De&s;cent to the Earth, with the Figure of his Per&s;on, is repre&s;ented in very lively Colours. Several of the <HI>French, Italian,</HI> and <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Poets have given a Loo&s;e to their Imaginati|ons in the De&s;cription of Angels: But I do not re|member to have met with any &s;o finely drawn, and &s;o conformable to the Notions which are given of them in Scripture, as this in <HI>Milton.</HI> After having &s;et him forth in all his heavenly Plumage, and re|pre&s;ented him as alighting upon the Earth, the Po|et concludes his De&s;cription with a Circum&s;tance, which is altogether new, and imagined with the greate&s;t Strength of Fancy. <Q><L>&mdash;Like <HI>Maia</HI>'s Son he &s;tood</L>
<L>And &s;hook his plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance fill'd</L>
<L>The Circuit wide&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>RAPHAEL</HI>'s Reception by the Guardian An|gels; his pa&s;&s;ing through the Wilderne&s;s of Sweets; his di&s;tant Appearance to <HI>Adam;</HI> have all the Gra|ces that Poetry is capable of be&s;towing. The Au|thor afterwards gives us a particular De&s;cription of <HI>Eve</HI> in her Dome&s;tick Employments. <Q><L>So &s;aying, with di&s;patchful looks in ha&s;te.</L>
<L>She turns, on ho&s;pitable thoughts intent,</L>
<L>What choice to chu&s;e for delicacy be&s;t,</L>
<L>What order, &s;o contriv'd as not to mix</L>

THOUGH in this, and other Parts of the &s;ame Book, the Subject is only the Hou&s;ewifry of our Fir&s;t Parent, it is &s;et off with &s;o many plea&s;ing Images and &s;trong Expre&s;&s;ions, as make it none of the lea&s;t agreeable Parts in this Divine Work.</P>
<P>THE natural Maje&s;ty of <HI>Adam,</HI> and at the &s;ame Time his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Behaviour to the &s;uperior Be|ing, who had vouch&s;afed to be his Gue&s;t; the &s;olemn <HI>Hail</HI> which the Angel be&s;tows upon the Mother of Mankind, with the Figure of <HI>Eve</HI> mini&s;tring at the Table, are Circum&s;tances which de&s;erve to be admired.</P>
<P><HI>RAPHAEL</HI>'s Behaviour is every Way &s;uita|ble to the Dignity of his Nature, and to that Character of a Sociable Spirit, with which the Au|thor has &s;o judiciou&s;ly introduced him. He had re|ceived In&s;tructions to conver&s;e with <HI>Adam,</HI> as one Friend conver&s;es with another, and to warn him of the Enemy, who was contriving his De&s;truction: Accordingly he is repre&s;ented as &s;itting down at a Table with <HI>Adam,</HI> and eating of the Fruits of <HI>Pa|radi&s;e.</HI> The Occa&s;ion naturally leads him to his Di&s;cour&s;e on the Food of Angels. After having thus entered into Conver&s;ation with Man upon more indifferent Subjects, he warns him of this O|bedience, and makes a natural Tran&s;ition to the Hi&s;tory of that fallen Angel, who was employed in the Circumvention of our fir&s;t Parents.</P>
<P>HADI follow'd Mon&s;ieur <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI>'s Method, in my fir&s;t Paper on <HI>Milton,</HI> I &s;hould have dated the A|ction of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> from the Beginning of <HI>Ra|phael</HI>'s Speech in this Book, as he &s;uppo&s;es the A|ction of the <HI>Aeneid</HI> to begin in the &s;econd Book of that Poem. I could alledge many Rea&s;ons for my drawing the Action of the <HI>Aeneid</HI> rather from its immediate Beginning in the fir&s;t Book, than from its remote Beginning in the &s;econd, and &s;hew why I have con&s;idered the &s;acking of <HI>Troy</HI> as an
<PB N="82" REF="81">
<HI>Epi&s;ode,</HI> according to the common Acceptation of that Word. But as this would be a dry unenter|taining Piece of Critici&s;m, and perhaps unnece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e who have read my fir&s;t Paper, I &s;hall not enlarge upon it. Which-ever of the Notions be true, the Unity of <HI>Milton</HI>'s Action is pre&s;erved ac|cording to either of them; whether we con&s;ider the Fall of Man in its immediate Beginning, as proceeding from the Re&s;olutions taken in the in|fernal Council; or in its more remote Beginning, as proceeding from the fir&s;t Revolt of the Angels in Heaven. The Occa&s;ion which <HI>Milton</HI> a&s;&s;igns for this Revolt, as it is founded on Hints in Holy Writ, and on the Opinion of &s;ome great Writers, &s;o it was the mo&s;t proper that the Poet could have made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>THE Revolt in Heaven is de&s;cribed with great Force of Indignation, and a fine Variety of Circum|&s;tances. The learned Reader cannot but be plea&s;ed with the Poet's Imitation of <HI>Homer</HI> in the la&s;t of the following Lines. <Q><L>At length into the limits of the North</L>
<L>They came, and Satan took his Royal Seat</L>
<L>High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount</L>
<L>Rais'd on a Mount, with Pyramids and Tow'rs</L>
<L>From Diamond Quarries hewn, and Rocks of Gold,</L>
<L>The Palace of great <HI>Lucifer,</HI> (&s;o call</L>
<L>That Structure in the Dialect of Men</L>
<L>Interpreted)&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>HOMER</HI> mentions Per&s;ons and Things, which he tells us in the Language of the Gods are call'd by different Names from tho&s;e they go by in the Language of Men. <HI>Milton</HI> has imitated him with his u&s;ual Judgment in this particular Place, where|in he has likewi&s;e the Authority of Scripture to ju&s;tify him. The Part of <HI>Abdiel,</HI> who was the on|ly
<PB N="83" REF="82">
Spirit that in this infinite Ho&s;t of Angels pre|&s;erved his Allegiance to his Maker, exhibits to us a noble Moral of religious Singularity. The Zeal of the Seraph breaks forth in a becoming Warmth of Sentiments and Expre&s;&s;ions, as the Character which is given us of him denotes that generous Scorn and Intrepidity which attends heroic Virtue. The Author doubtle&s;s de&s;igned it as a Pattern to tho&s;e who live among Mankind in their pre&s;ent State of Degeneracy and Corruption. <Q><L>So &s;pake the Seraph <HI>Abdiel</HI> faithful found,</L>
<L>Among the faithle&s;s, faithful only he;</L>
<L>Among innumerable fal&s;e, unmov'd,</L>
<L>&V;n&s;haken, un&s;educ'd, unterrify'd;</L>
<L>His Loyalty he kept, his Love, his Zeal:</L>
<L>Nor Number, nor Example with him wrought</L>
<L>To &s;werve from Truth, or change his con&s;tant mind</L>
<L>Though &s;ingle. From amid&s;t them forth he pa&s;s'd,</L>
<L>Long Way through ho&s;tile Scorn, which he &s;u&s;tain'd</L>

<P>WE are now entering upon the Sixth Book of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> in which the Poet de|&s;cribes the Battel of Angels; having rai&s;ed his Rea|der's Expectation, and prepar'd him for it by &s;e|veral Pa&s;&s;ages in the preceding Books. I omitted quoting the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages in my Ob&s;ervations on the
<PB N="84" REF="83">
former Books, having purpo&s;ely re&s;erved them for the Opening of this, the Subject of which gave Occa&s;ion to them. The Author's Imagination was &s;o inflamed with this great Scene of Action, that wherever he &s;peaks of it, he ri&s;es, if po&s;&s;ible, a|bove him&s;elf. Thus where he mentions <HI>Satan</HI> in the Beginning of his Poem. <Q><L>&mdash;Him the Almighty Power</L>
<L>Hurt'd headlong flaming from th' Etherial Skie,</L>
<L>With hideous ruin and combu&s;tion down</L>
<L>To bottomle&s;s perdition, there to dwell</L>
<L>In Adamantine Chains and Penal Fire,</L>
<L>Who dur&s;t defie the Omnipotent to Arms.</L></Q></P>
<P>WE have likewi&s;e &s;everal noble Hints of it in the infernal Conference. <Q><L>O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers</L>
<L>That led th' embattel'd Seraphim to War,</L>
<L>Too well I &s;ee and rue the dire event,</L>
<L>That with &s;ad overthrow and foul defect</L>
<L>Hath lo&s;t us Heav'n and all this mighty ho&s;t</L>
<L>In horrible de&s;truction laid thus low.</L>
<L>But &s;ee the angry Victor has recall'd</L>
<L>His Mini&s;ters of vengeance and pur&s;uit</L>
<L>Back to the gates of Heav'n: The Sulphurous hail,</L>
<L>Shot after us in Storm, o'erblown hath laid</L>
<L>The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice</L>
<L>Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder</L>
<L>Wing'd with red lightning and impetuous rage,</L>
<L>Perhaps hath &s;pent his Shafts, and cea&s;es now</L>
<L>To bellow through the va&s;t and boundle&s;s Deep.</L></Q></P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal other very &s;ublime Ima|ges on the &s;ame Subject in the Fir&s;t Book, as al|&s;o in the Second. <Q><PB N="85" REF="84">
<L>What when we fled amain, pur&s;u'd and &s;trook</L>
<L>With Heav'n's afflicting Thunder, and be&s;ought</L>
<L>The Deep to &s;helter us; this Hell then &s;eem'd</L>
<L>A refuge from tho&s;e wounds&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>IN &s;hort, the Poet never mentions any thing of this Battel, but in &s;uch Images of Greatne&s;s and Terrour as are &s;uitable to the Subject. Among &s;everal others, I cannot forbear quoting that Pa&s;|&s;age where the Power, who is de&s;crib'd as pre&s;i|ding over the Chaos, &s;peaks in the Third Book. <Q><L>Thus <HI>Satan;</HI> and him thus the Anarch old</L>
<L>With faultring &s;peech and vi&s;age incompos'd</L>
<L>An&s;wer'd, I know thee, Stranger, who thou art,</L>
<L>That mighty leading Angel, who of late</L>
<L>Made head again&s;t Heav'ns King, tho' overthrown.</L>
<L>I &s;aw and hoard; for &s;uch a numerous Ho&s;t</L>
<L>Fled not in Silence through the frighted Deep</L>
<L>With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,</L>
<L>Confu&s;ion wor&s;e confounded; and Heav'ns Gates</L>
<L>Pour'd out by Millions her victorious Bands</L>
<L>Pur&s;uing.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>IT required great Pregnacy of Invention, and Strength of Imagination, to fill this Battel with &s;uch Circum&s;tances as &s;hould rai&s;e and a&s;toni&s;h the Mind of the Reader; and, at the &s;ame time, an Exactne&s;s of Judgment to avoid every thing that might appear light or trivial. Tho&s;e who look into <HI>Homer,</HI> are &s;urpriz'd to find his Battels &s;till ri&s;ing one above another, and improving in Hor|rour, to the Conclu&s;ion of the <HI>Iliad. Milton</HI>'s Fight of Angels is wrought up with the &s;ame Beau|ty. It is u&s;her'd in with &s;uch Signs of Wrath as are &s;uitable to Omnipotence incen&s;ed. The fir&s;t Engagement is carried on under a Cope of Fire, occa&s;ion'd by the Flights of innumerable burning
<PB N="86" REF="85">
Darts and Arrows which are di&s;charged from ei|ther Ho&s;t. The &s;econd On&s;et is &s;till more terrible, as it is filled with tho&s;e artificial Thunders, which &s;eem to make the Victory doubtful, and produce a kind of Con&s;ternation even in the Good Angels. This is follow'd by the tearing up of Mountains and Promontories; 'till, in the la&s;t Place, <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> comes forth in the Fullne&s;s of Maje&s;ty and Ter|rour. The Pomp of his Appearance, amid&s;t the Roarings of his Thunders, the Fla&s;hes of his Light|nings, and the Noi&s;e of his Chariot-Wheels, is de&s;cribed with the utmo&s;t Flights of Humane I|magination.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing in the fir&s;t and la&s;t Day's Engagement which does not appear natural, and agreeable enough to the Ideas mo&s;t Readers would conceive of a Fight between two Armies of An|gels.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd Day's Engagement is apt to &s;tar|tle an Imagination, which has not been rai&s;ed and qualified for &s;uch a De&s;cription, by the reading of the antient Poets, and of <HI>Homer</HI> in particular. It was certainly a very bold Thought in our Author, to a&s;cribe the fir&s;t U&s;e of Artillery to the Rebel Angels. But as &s;uch a pernicious Invention may be well &s;uppo&s;ed to have proceeded from &s;uch Authors, &s;o it entered very properly into the Thoughts of that Being, who is all along de&s;cri|bed as a&s;piring to the Maje&s;ty of his Maker. Such Engines were the only In&s;truments he could have made u&s;e of to imitate tho&s;e Thunders, that in all Poetry, both Sacred and Prophane, are repre|&s;ented as the Arms of the Almighty. The tearing up the Hills was not altogether &s;o daring a Thought as the former. We are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, prepa|red for &s;uch an Incident by the De&s;cription of the Giants War, which we meet with among the an|cient Poets. What &s;till made this Circum&s;tance
<PB N="87" REF="86">
the more proper for the Poet's U&s;e, is the Opinion of many Learned Men, that the Fable of the Gi|ants War, which makes &s;o great a Noi&s;e in An|tiquity, and gave Birth to the &s;ublime&s;t De&s;cripti|on in <HI>He&s;iod</HI>'s Works, was an Allegory founded upon this very Tradition of a Fight between the good and bad Angels.</P>
<P>IT may, perhaps, be worth while to con&s;ider with what Judgment <HI>Milton,</HI> in this Narration, has avoided every thing that is mean and trivial in the De&s;criptions of the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Poets; and, at the &s;ame time, improv'd every great Hint which he met with in their Works upon this Subject. <HI>Homer</HI> in that Pa&s;&s;age, which <HI>Longinus</HI> has celebra|ted for its Sublimene&s;s, and which <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Ovid</HI> have copied after him, tells us that the Giants threw <HI>O&s;&s;a</HI> upon <HI>Olympus,</HI> and <HI>Pelion</HI> upon <HI>O&s;&s;a.</HI> He adds an Epithet to <HI>Pelion</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">) which very much &s;wells the Idea, by bringing up to the Rea|der's Imagination all the Woods that grew upon it. There is further a great Beauty in his &s;ingling out by Name the&s;e three remarkable Mountains, &s;o well known to the <HI>Greeks.</HI> This la&s;t is &s;uch a Beauty as the Scene of <HI>Milton</HI>'s War could not po&s;&s;ibly furni&s;h him with. <HI>Cloudian,</HI> in his Frag|ment upon the Gyants War, has given full Scope to that Wildne&s;s of Imagination which was natu|ral to him. He tells us, that the Giants tore up whole I&s;lands by the Roots, and threw them at the Gods. He de&s;cribes one of them in particu|lar taking up <HI>Lemnos</HI> in his Arms, and whirling it to the Skies, with all <HI>Vulcan</HI>'s Shop in the mid&s;t of it. Another tears up Mount <HI>Ida,</HI> with the River <HI>Enipeus,</HI> which ran down the Sides of it; but the Poet, not content to de&s;cribe him with this Moun|tain upon his Shoulders, tells us, that the River flow'd down his Back, as he held it up in that Po&s;ture. It is vi&s;ible to every judicious Reader,
<PB N="88" REF="87" MS="y">
that &s;uch Ideas favour more of Burle&s;que than of the Sublime. They proceed from a Wantonne&s;s of Imagination, and rather divert the Mind than a&s;toni&s;h it. <HI>Milton</HI> has taken every thing that is Sublime in the&s;e &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages, and compo&s;es out of them the following great Image. <Q><L>From their Foundations loo&s;ning to and fro</L>
<L>They pluck'd the &s;eated Hills with all their load,</L>
<L>Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the &s;haggy tops</L>

<P>WE have the full Maje&s;ty of <HI>Homer</HI> in this &s;hort De&s;cription, improved by the Imagination of <HI>Clau|dian,</HI> without its Puerilities.</P>
<P>I need not point out the De&s;cription of the fal|len Angels &s;eeing the Promontories hanging over their Heads in &s;uch a dreadful Manner, with the other numberle&s;s Beauties in this Book, which are &s;o con&s;picuous, that they cannot e&s;cape the Notice of the mo&s;t ordinary Reader.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed &s;o many wonderful Strokes of Poetry in this Book, and &s;uch a Variety of &s;ub|lime Ideas, that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have given them a Place within the Bounds of this Paper. Be&s;ides that, I find it in a great mea&s;ure done to my Hand at the End of my Lord <HI>Ro&s;|common</HI>'s E&s;&s;ay on tran&s;lated Poetry. I &s;hall refer my Reader thither for &s;ome of the Ma&s;ter-Strokes in the Sixth Book of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> though at the &s;ame time there are many others which that no|ble Author has not taken notice of.</P>
<P><HI>MILTON,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the &s;ublime-Genius he was Ma&s;ter of, has in this Book drawn to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance all the Helps he could meet with among the ancient Poets. The Sword of <HI>Michael,</HI> which makes &s;o great a Havock among the bad Angels, was given him, we are told; out of the Armory of God. <Q><PB N="89" REF="88">
<L>&mdash;But the Sword</L>
<L>Of <HI>Michael</HI> from the Armory of God</L>
<L>Was giv'n him temper'd &s;o, that neither keen</L>
<L>Nor &s;olid might re&s;i&s;t that edge: it met</L>
<L>The Sword of <HI>Satan</HI> with &s;teep force to &s;mite</L>
<L>De&s;cending, and in half cut &s;heere,&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>THIS Pa&s;&s;age is a Copy of that in <HI>Virgil,</HI> wherein the Poet tells us, that the Sword of <HI>AEneas,</HI> which was given him by a Deity, broke into Pieces the Sword of <HI>Turnus,</HI> which came from a mortal Forge. As the Moral in this Place is Divine, &s;o by the way we may ob&s;erve, that the be&s;towing on a Man who is favour'd by Heav'n &s;uch an Allegorical Weapon, is very conformable to the old Ea&s;tern Way of Thinking. Not only <HI>Homer</HI> has made u&s;e of it, but we find the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Hero in the Book of <HI>Maccabees,</HI> who had fought the Battels of the cho|&s;en People with &s;o much Glory and Succe&s;s, recei|ving in his Dream a Sword from the Hand of the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah.</HI> The following Pa&s;&s;age, wherein <HI>Satan</HI> is de&s;cribed as wounded by the Sword of <HI>Michael,</HI> is in Imitation of <HI>Homer.</HI> <Q><L>The griding Sword with di&s;continuous wound</L>
<L>Pa&s;s'd through him, but th' Ethereal &s;ub&s;tance clo&s;ed</L>
<L>Not long divi&s;ible, and from the ga&s;h</L>
<L>A &s;tream of Nectarous humour i&s;&s;uing flow'd</L>
<L>Sanguin, &s;uch as cele&s;tial Spirits may bleed,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd all his Armour &s;tain'd&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>HOMER</HI> tells us in the &s;ame manner, that up|on <HI>Diomedes</HI> wounding the Gods, there flow'd from the Wound an <HI>Ichor,</HI> or pure kind of Blood, which was not bred from Mortal Viands; and that tho' the Pain was exqui&s;itely great, the Wound &s;oon clo&s;ed up and healed in tho&s;e Beings who are ve|&s;ted with Immortality.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="89">
I que&s;tion not but <HI>Milton</HI> in his De&s;cription of his furious <HI>Moloc</HI> flying from the Battel, and bel|lowing with the Wound he had received, had his Eye on <HI>Mars</HI> in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> who, upon his being wounded, is repre&s;ented as retiring out of the Fight, and making an Outcry louder than that of a whole Army when it begins the Charge. <HI>Homer</HI> adds, that the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Trojans,</HI> who were engaged in a general Battel, were terrified on each Side with the bellowing of this wounded Deity. The Reader will ea&s;ily ob&s;erve how <HI>Milton</HI> has kept all the Hor|rour of this Image without running into the Ri|dicule of it. <Q><L>&mdash;Where the might of <HI>Gabriel</HI> fought,</L>
<L>And with fierce En&s;igns pierc'd the deep array</L>
<L>Of <HI>Moloc</HI> furious King, who him defy'd,</L>
<L>And at his Chariot wheels to drag him bound</L>
<L>Threaten'd, nor from the Holy One of Heav'n</L>
<L>Refrain'd his tongue bla&s;phemous; but anon</L>
<L>Down cloven to the wa&s;te, with &s;hatter'd Arms</L>
<L>And uncouth pain fled bellowing.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>MILTON</HI> has likewi&s;e rai&s;ed his De&s;cription in this Book with many Images taken out of the Poetical Parts of Scripture. The Me&s;&s;iah's Chari|ot, as <HI>I</HI> have before taken Notice, is form'd upon a Vi&s;ion of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> who, as <HI>Grotius</HI> ob&s;erves, has very much in him of <HI>Homer</HI>'s Spirit in the Poeti|cal Parts of his Prophecy.</P>
<P>THE following Lines in that glorious Com|mi&s;&s;ion which is given the Me&s;&s;iah to extirpate the Ho&s;t of Rebel Angels, is drawn from a &s;ublime Pa&s;&s;age in the P&s;alms. <Q><L>Go then thou mightie&s;t in thy Father's might</L>
<L>A&s;cend my Chariot, guide the rapid wheels</L>
<L>That &s;hake Heaven's ba&s;is, bring forth all my War,</L>
<L><PB N="91" REF="90">
My Bow, my Thunder, my almighty Arms,</L>
<L>Gird on thy Sword on thy pui&s;&s;ant Thigh.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Reader will ea&s;ily di&s;cover many other Stroaks of the &s;ame Nature.</P>
<P>THERE is no que&s;tion but <HI>Milton</HI> had heated his Imagination with the Fight of the Gods in <HI>Homer,</HI> before he entered upon this Engagement of the Angels. <HI>Homer</HI> there gives us a Scene of Men, Heroes, and Gods mixed together in Battel. <HI>Mars</HI> animates the contending Armies, and lifts up his Voice in &s;uch a manner, that it is heard di&s;tinctly amid&s;t all the Shouts and Confu&s;ion of the Fight. <HI>Jupiter</HI> at the &s;ame time thunders over their Heads; while <HI>Neptune</HI> rai&s;es &s;uch a Tempe&s;t, that the whole Field of Battel, and all the Tops of the Mountains, &s;hake about them. The Poet tells us, that <HI>Pluto</HI> him&s;elf, who&s;e Habitation was in the very Center of the Earth, was &s;o affrighted at the Shock, that he leapt from his Throne. <HI>Homer</HI> afterwards de&s;cribes <HI>Vulcan</HI> as pouring down a Storm of Fire upon the River <HI>Xanthus,</HI> and <HI>Minerva</HI> as throwing a Rock at <HI>Mars;</HI> who, he tells us, cove|red &s;even Acres in his Fall.</P>
<P>AS <HI>Homer</HI> has introduced into his Battel of the Gods every thing that is great and terrible in Na|ture, <HI>Milton</HI> has filled his Fight of Good and Bad Angels with all the like Circum&s;tances of Horrour. The Shout of Armies, the Ratling of Brazen Cha|riots, the Hurling of Rocks and Mountains, the Earthquake, the Fire, the Thunder, are all of them employ'd to lift up the Reader's Imagination, and give him a &s;uitable Idea of &s;o great an Action. With what Art has the Poet repre&s;ented the whole Body of the Earth trembling, even before it was created. <Q><L>All Heaven re&s;ounded, and had Earth been then,</L>
<L>All Earth had to its Center &s;hook&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="91">
IN how &s;ublime and ju&s;t a Manner does he af|terwards de&s;cribe the whole Heaven &s;haking under the Wheels of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah's</HI> Chariot, with that Ex|ception to the Throne of God? <Q><L>&mdash;&V;nder his burning Wheels</L>
<L>The &s;teadfa&s;t <HI>Empyrean</HI> &s;hook throughout,</L>
<L>All but the Throne it &s;elf of God&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> ap|pears cloathed with &s;o much Terrour and Maje&s;ty, the Poet has &s;till found Means to make his Rea|ders conceive an Idea of him beyond what he him&s;elf was able to de&s;cribe. <Q><L>Yet half his Strength he put not forth, but checkt</L>
<L>His thunder in mid Volly, for he meant</L>
<L>Not to de&s;troy, but root them out of Heav'n.</L></Q></P>
<P>IN a Word, <HI>Milton</HI>'s Genius, which was &s;o great in it &s;elf, and &s;o &s;trenghened by all the Helps of Learning, appears in this Book every way equal to his Subject, which was the mo&s;t &s;ublime that could enter into the Thoughts of a Poet. As he knew all the Arts of Affecting the Mind, he knew it was nece&s;&s;ary to give it certain Re&s;ting-places and Opportunities of recovering it &s;elf from Time to Time: He has therefore with great Addre&s;s inter|&s;per&s;ed &s;everal Speeches, Reflections, Similitudes, and the like Reliefs, to diver&s;ifie his Narration, and ea&s;e the Attention of the Reader, that he might come fre&s;h to his great Action; and by &s;uch a Con|tra&s;t of Ideas, have a more lively Ta&s;te of the no|bler Parts of his De&s;cription.</P>

<P><HI>LONGIN&V;S</HI> has ob&s;erved, that there may be a Loftine&s;s in Sentiments, where there is no Pa&s;&s;ion, and brings In&s;tances out of ancient Au|thors to &s;upport this his Opinion. The Pathetick, as that great Critick ob&s;erves, may animate and inflame the Sublime, but is not e&s;&s;ential to it. Accordingly, as he further remarks, we very often find that tho&s;e who excel mo&s;t in &s;tirring up the Pa&s;&s;ions, very often want the Talent of writing in the great and &s;ublime Manner; and &s;o on the contrary. <HI>Milton</HI> has &s;hewn him&s;elf a Ma&s;ter in both the&s;e Ways of Writing. The &s;eventh Book, which we are now entering upon, is an In&s;tance of that Sublime which is not mixt and work'd up with Pa&s;&s;ion. The Author appears in a kind of compo&s;ed and &s;edate Maje&s;ty; and tho' the Senti|ments do not give &s;o great an Emotion as tho&s;e in the former Book, they abound with as magni|ficent Ideas. The &s;ixth Book, like a troubled O|cean, repre&s;ents Greatne&s;s in Confu&s;ion; the &s;e|venth affects the Imagination like the Ocean in a Calm, and Fills the Mind of the Reader, without producing in it any Thing like Tumult or Agi|tation.</P>
<P>THE Critick above-mentioned, among the Rules which he lays down for &s;ucceeding in the &s;ublime
<PB N="94" REF="93">
way of writing, propo&s;es to his Reader, that he &s;hould imitate the mo&s;t celebrated Authors who have gone before him, and been engaged in Works of the &s;ame Nature; as in particular that if he writes on a poetical Subject, he &s;hould con&s;ider how <HI>Homer</HI> would have &s;poken on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion. By this Means one great Genius often catches the Flame from another, and writes in his Spirit with|out copying &s;ervilely after him. There are a thou|&s;and &s;hining Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Virgil,</HI> which have been lighted up by <HI>Homer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>MILTON,</HI> tho' his own natural Strength of Genius was capable of furni&s;hing out a perfect Work, has doubtle&s;s very much rai&s;ed and ennobled his Conceptions, by &s;uch an Imitation as that which <HI>Longinus</HI> has recommended.</P>
<P>IN this Book, which gives us an Account of the Six Days Works, the Poet received but very few A&s;&s;i&s;tances from Heathen Writers, who were Stran|gers to the Wonders of Creation. But as there are many glorious Strokes of Poetry upon this Subject in Holy Writ, the Author has numberle&s;s Allu&s;ions to them through the whole Cour&s;e of this Book. The great Critick I have before mentioned, though an Heathen, has taken Notice of the &s;ublime Man|ner in which the Law-giver of the <HI>Jews</HI> has de&s;crib|ed the Creation in the Fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is;</HI> and there are many other Pa&s;&s;ages in Scripture, which ri&s;e up to the &s;ame Maje&s;ty, where this Sub|ject is touched upon. <HI>Milton</HI> has &s;hewn his Judg|ment very remarkably, in making u&s;e of &s;uch of the&s;e as were proper for his Poem, and in duly qualifying tho&s;e high Strains of Ea&s;tern Poetry, which were &s;uited to Readers who&s;e Imaginations were &s;et to an higher Pitch, than tho&s;e of colder Climates.</P>
<P><HI>ADAM</HI>'s Speech to the Angel, wherein he de|&s;ires an Account of what had pa&s;&s;ed within the Re|gions
<PB N="95" REF="94">
of Nature before the Creation, is very great and &s;olemn. The following Lines, in which he tells him, that the Day is not too far &s;pent for him to enter upon &s;uch a Subject, are exqui&s;ite in their Kind. <Q><L>And the Great Light of Day yet wants to run</L>
<L>Much of his race though &s;teep, &s;u&s;pen&s;e in Heav'n</L>
<L>Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he hears,</L>
<L>And longer will delay to hear thee tell</L>
<L>His Generation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Angel's encouraging our Fir&s;t Parents in a mode&s;t Pur&s;uit after Knowledge, with the Cau&s;es which he a&s;&s;igns for the Creation of the World, are very ju&s;t and beautiful. The <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> by whom, as we are told in Scripture, the Worlds were made, comes forth in the Power of his Father, &s;ur|rounded with an Ho&s;t of Angels, and cloathed with &s;uch a Maje&s;ty as becomes his entering upon a Work, which, according to our Conceptions, ap|pears the utmo&s;t Exertion of Omnipotence. What a beautiful De&s;cription has our Author rai&s;ed upon that Hint in one of the Prophets; <HI>And behold there came four Chariots out from between two Mountains, and the Mountains were Mountains of Bra&s;s?</HI> <Q><L>About his Chariot numberle&s;s were pour'd</L>
<L><HI>Cherub</HI> and <HI>Seraph,</HI> Potentates and Thrones,</L>
<L>And Virtues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd,</L>
<L>From the Armoury of God, where &s;tand of old</L>
<L>Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd</L>
<L>Again&s;t a &s;olemn day, harne&s;t at hand;</L>

<L>Spontaneous, for within them Spirit liv'd</L>

<P><PB N="96" REF="95">
I have before taken Notice of the&s;e Chariots of God, and of the&s;e Gates of Heaven, and &s;hall here only add, that <HI>Homer</HI> gives us the &s;ame Idea of the latter as opening of them&s;elves, tho' he afterwards takes off from it, by telling us, that the <HI>Hours</HI> fir&s;t of all removed tho&s;e prodigious Heaps of Clouds which lay as a Barrier before them.</P>
<P>I do not know any thing in the whole Poem more &s;ublime than the De&s;cription which follows, where the Me&s;&s;iah is repre&s;ented at the Head of his An|gels, as looking down into the <HI>Chaos,</HI> calming its Confu&s;ion, riding into the mid&s;t of it, and drawing the fir&s;t Out-Line of the Creation.<Q><LG>

<L>&V;p from the bottom turn'd by furious winds</L>

THE Thought of the Golden Compa&s;&s;es is con|ceiv'd altogether in <HI>Homer</HI>'s Spirit, and is a very noble Incident in this wonderful De&s;cription. <HI>Ho|mer,</HI> when he &s;peaks of the Gods, a&s;cribes to them &s;everal Arms and In&s;truments with the &s;ame Great|ne&s;s of Imagination. Let the Reader only peru&s;e the De&s;cription of <HI>Minerva</HI>'s <HI>Aegis,</HI> or Buckler, in the Fifth Book of the Iliad, with her Spear which would over|turn whole Squadrons, and her Helmet, that was &s;ufficient to cover an Army drawn out of an hun|dred Cities: The Golden Compa&s;&s;es in the above|mentioned Pa&s;&s;age appear a very natural In&s;trument in the Hand of him, whom <HI>Plato</HI> &s;omewhere calls the Divine Geometrician. As Poetry delights in cloathing ab&s;tracted Ideas in Allegories and &s;en&s;i|ble Images, we find a magnificent De&s;cription of the Creation form'd after the &s;ame manner in one of the Prophets, wherein he de&s;cribes the Almighty Architect as mea&s;uring the Waters in the Hollow of his Hand, meteing out the Heavens with his Span, comprehending the Du&s;t of the Earth in a Mea&s;ure, weighing the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Balance. Another of them de&s;cribing the Su|preme Being in this great Work of Creation, re|pre&s;ents him as laying the Foundations of the Earth, and &s;tretching a Line upon it. And in ano|ther Place as garni&s;hing the Heavens, &s;tretching out the North over the empty Place, and hanging the Earth upon Nothing. This la&s;t noble Thought <HI>Milton</HI> has expre&s;s'd in the following Ver&s;e. <Q><L>And Earth &s;elf-balanc'd on her Center hung.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Beauties of De&s;cription in this Book lie &s;o very thick, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate them in this Paper. The Poet has employ'd on them the whole Energy of our Tongue. The &s;everal great Scenes of the Creation ri&s;e up to view one

<P>ONE would wonder how the Poet could be &s;o conci&s;e in his De&s;cription of the Six Days Works, as to comprehend them within the Bounds of an Epi&s;ode, and at the &s;ame Time &s;o particular, as to give us a lively Idea of them. This is &s;till more remarkable in his Account of the fifth and &s;ixth Days, in which he has drawn out to our View the whole Animal Creation, from the Reptil to the Behemoth. As the Lion and the Leviathan are two of the noble&s;t Productions in the World of living Creatures, the Reader will find a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Spirit of Poetry in the Account which our Author gives us of them. The Sixth Day concludes with the Formation of Man, upon which the Angel takes Occa&s;ion, as he did after the Battel in Hea|ven, to remind <HI>Adam</HI> of his Obedience, which was the principal De&s;ign of this his Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>THE Poet afterwards repre&s;ents the Me&s;&s;iah re|turning into Heaven, and taking a Survey of his great Work. There is &s;omething inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;ub|lime in this part of the Poem, where the Author de&s;cribes that great Period of Time, filled with &s;o many glorious Circum&s;tances; when the Heavens and Earth were fini&s;hed; when the Me&s;&s;iah a&s;cen|ded up in Triumph through the Everla&s;ting Gates; when he looked down with Plea&s;ure upon his new Creation; when every Part of Nature &s;eem'd to re|joice
<PB N="100" REF="99">
in its Exi&s;tence; when the Morning Stars &s;ang together, and all the Sons of God &s;houted for Joy. <Q><L>So Ev'n and Morn accompli&s;h'd the Sixth day:</L>
<L>Yet not till the Creator from his Work</L>
<L>De&s;i&s;ting, tho' unwearied, up return'd,</L>
<L>&V;p to the Heav'n of Heav'ns his high abode,</L>
<L>Thence to behold this new created World</L>
<L>Th' Addition of his Empire; how it &s;hew'd</L>
<L>In pro&s;pect from his throne, how good, how fair,</L>
<L>An&s;wering his great Idea. &V;p he rode</L>
<L>Follow'd with acclamation and the Sound</L>
<L>Symphonious of ten thou&s;and harps that tuned</L>
<L>Angelic Harmonies: the earth, the air</L>
<L>Re&s;oxnding, (thou remember'&s;t, for thou heard'&s;t)</L>
<L>The Heavens and all the Con&s;tellations rung,</L>
<L>The Planets in their Station li&s;t'ning &s;tood,</L>
<L>While the bright pomp a&s;cended jubilant.</L>
<L>Open ye everla&s;ting gates, they &s;ung,</L>
<L>Open ye Heav'ns, your living doors, let in</L>
<L>The great Creator from his work return'd</L>
<L>Magnificent, his &s;ix days work a World.</L></Q></P>
<P>I cannot conclude this Book upon the Creation, without mentioning a Poem which has lately ap|pear'd under that Title. The Work was underta|ken with &s;o good an Intention, and is executed with &s;o great a Ma&s;tery, that it de&s;erves to be look|ed upon as one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful and noble Pro|ductions in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;e. The Reader cannot but be plea&s;ed to find the Depths of Philo&s;ophy en|livened with all the Charms of Poetry, and to &s;ee &s;o great a Strength of Rea&s;on, amid&s;t &s;o beautiful a Redundancy of the Imagination. The Author has &s;hewn us that De&s;ign in all the Works of Nature, which nece&s;&s;arily leads us to the Knowledge of its fir&s;t Cau&s;e. In &s;hort, he has illu&s;trated, by num|berle&s;s
<PB N="101" REF="100">
and inconte&s;table In&s;tances, that divine Wi&s;|dom, which the Son of <HI>Sirach</HI> has &s;o nobly a&s;cribed to the Supreme Being in his Formation of the World, when he tells us, that <HI>He created her, and &s;aw her, and numbered her, and poured her out upon all his Works.</HI></P>

<P>THE Accounts which <HI>Raphael</HI> gives of the Bat|tel of Angels, and the Creation of the World, have in them tho&s;e Qualifications which the Cri|ticks judge requi&s;ite to an Epi&s;ode. They are nearly related to the principal Action, and have a ju&s;t Connection with the Fable.</P>
<P>THE Eighth Book opens with a Beautiful De|&s;cription of the Impre&s;&s;ion which this Di&s;cour&s;e of the Arch-Angel made on our fir&s;t Parents. <HI>Adam</HI> afterwards, by a very natural Curio&s;ity, enquries con|cerning the Motions of tho&s;e Cele&s;tial Bodies which make the mo&s;t glorious Appearance among the &s;ix Days Works. The Poet here, with a great deal of Art, repre&s;ents <HI>Eve</HI> as withdrawing from this Part of their Conver&s;ation to Amu&s;ements more &s;uitable to her Sex. He well knew, that the Epi&s;ode in this Book, which is filled with <HI>Adam</HI>'s Account of his Pa&s;&s;ion and E&s;teem for <HI>Eve,</HI> would have been im|proper for her Hearing, and has therefore devi&s;ed very ju&s;t and beautiful Rea&s;ons for her retiring. <Q><PB N="102" REF="101">

<P>THE Angel's returning a doubtful An&s;wer to <HI>Adam</HI>'s Enquiries, was not only proper for the mo|ral Rea&s;on which the Poet a&s;&s;igns, but becau&s;e it would have been highly ab&s;urd to have given the Sanction of an Arch-angel to any particular Sy&s;tem of Philo&s;ophy. The chief Points in the <HI>Ptolemaick</HI> and <HI>Copernican</HI> Hypothe&s;is are de&s;cribed with great Conci&s;ene&s;s and Per&s;picuity, and at the &s;ame Time dre&s;&s;ed in very plea&s;ing and poetical Images.</P>
<P><HI>ADAM,</HI> to detain the Angel, enters afterwards upon his own Hi&s;tory, and relates to him the Cir|cum&s;tances in which he found him&s;elf upon his Creation; as al&s;o his Conver&s;ation with his Maker and his fir&s;t meeting with <HI>Eve.</HI> There is no Part of the Poem more apt to rai&s;e the Attention of the Reader, than this Di&s;cour&s;e of our great Ance&s;tor; as nothing can be more &s;urprizing and delightful
<PB N="103" REF="102">
to us, than to hear the Sentiments that aro&s;e in the Fir&s;t Man while he was yet new and fre&s;h from the Hands of his Creator. The Poet has interwo|ven every thing which is delivered upon this Sub|ject in Holy Writ with &s;o many beautiful Imagina|tions of his own, that nothing can be conceived more ju&s;t and natural than this whole Epi&s;ode. As our Author knew this Subject could not but be agreeable to his Reader, he would not throw it in|to the Relation of the &s;ix Days Works, but re&s;er|ved it for a di&s;tinct Epi&s;ode, that he might have an Opportunity of expatiating upon it more at large. Before I enter on this Part of the Poem, I cannot but take Notice of two &s;hining Pa&s;&s;ages in the Dialogue between <HI>Adam</HI> and the Angel. The fir&s;t is that wherein our Ance&s;tor gives an Account of the Plea&s;ure he took in conver&s;ing with him, which contains a very noble Moral. <Q><L>For while I &s;it with thee, I &s;eem in Heav'n,</L>
<L>And &s;weeter thy Di&s;cour&s;e is to my Ear</L>
<L>Than Fruits of Palm-tree plea&s;ante&s;t to Thir&s;t</L>
<L>And Hunger, both from Labour, at the Hour</L>
<L>Of &s;weet Repa&s;t; they &s;atiate, and &s;oon fill,</L>
<L>Tho' plea&s;ant; but thy Words with Grace divine</L>
<L>Imbu'd, bring to their Sweetne&s;s no Satiety.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE other I &s;hall mention is that in which the Angel gives a Rea&s;on why he &s;hould be glad to hear the Story <HI>Adam</HI> was about to relate. <Q><L>For I that Day was ab&s;ent, as befell,</L>
<L>Bound on a Voyage uncouth and ob&s;cure,</L>
<L>Far on Excur&s;ion towards the Gates of Hell,</L>
<L>Squar'd in full Legion (&s;uch command we had)</L>
<L>To &s;ee that none thence i&s;&s;ued forth a Spy,</L>
<L>Or Enemy, while God was in his Work,</L>
<L><PB N="104" REF="103">
Le&s;t he incen&s;t at &s;uch Eruption bold,</L>
<L>De&s;truction with Creation might have mix'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>THERE is no Que&s;tion but our Poet drew the Image in what follows from that in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Sixth Book, where <HI>Aeneas</HI> and the Sybil &s;tand before the Adamantine Gates, which are there de&s;crib'd as &s;hut upon the Place of Torments, and li&s;ten to the Groans, the Clank of Chains, and the Noi&s;e of Iron Whips, that were heard in tho&s;e Regions of Pain and Sorrow. <Q><L>&mdash;Fa&s;t we found, fa&s;t &s;hut</L>
<L>The di&s;mal Gates, and barricadoed &s;trong;</L>
<L>But long e'er our approaching heard within</L>
<L>Noi&s;e, other than the Sound of Dance or Song,</L>
<L>Torment, and loud Lament, and furious Rage.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>ADAM</HI> then proceeds to give an Account of his Condition and Sentiments immediately after his Creation. How agreeably does he repre&s;ent the Po&s;ture in which he found him&s;elf, the delight|ful Landskip that &s;urrounded him, and the Glad|ne&s;s of Heart which grew up in him on that Oc|ca&s;ion. <Q><L>&mdash;As new waked from &s;ounde&s;t Sleep,</L>
<L>Soft on the flowry Herb I found me laid</L>
<L>In balmy Sweat, which with his Beams the Sun</L>
<L>Soon dried, and on the reaking Moi&s;ture fed.</L>
<L>Streight toward Heav'n my wondering Eyes I turn'd,</L>
<L>And gaz'd a while the amply Sky, till rais'd</L>
<L>By quick in&s;tinctive Motion up I &s;prung,</L>
<L>As thitherward endeavouring, and upright</L>
<L>Stood on my Feet: About me round I &s;aw</L>
<L>Hill, Dale, and &s;hady Woods, and &s;unny Plains,</L>
<L>And liquid Lap&s;e of murmuring Streams; by the&s;e,</L>
<L>Creatures that liv'd, and mov'd, and walk'd, or flew,</L>
<L><PB N="105" REF="104">
Birds on the Branches warbling; all things &s;mil'd:</L>
<L>With Fragrance and with Joy my Heart o'erflow'd.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>ADAM</HI> is afterwards de&s;crib'd as &s;urpriz'd at his own Exi&s;tence, and taking a Survey of him|&s;elf, and of all the Works of Nature. He likewi&s;e is repre&s;ented as di&s;covering by the Light of Rea|&s;on, that he and every thing about him mu&s;t have been the Effect of &s;ome Being infinitely good and powerful, and that this Being had a Right to his Wor&s;hip and Adoration. His fir&s;t Addre&s;s to the Sun, and to tho&s;e Parts of the Creation which made the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Figure, is very natural and amu&s;ing to the Imagination. <Q><L>&mdash;Thou Sun, &s;aid I, fair Light,</L>
<L>And thou enlight'ned Earth, &s;o fre&s;h and gay,</L>
<L>Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plains,</L>
<L>And ye that live and move, fair Creatures tell,</L>
<L>Tell if you &s;aw, how came I thus, how here?</L></Q></P>
<P>HIS next Sentiment, when upon his fir&s;t going to &s;leep he fancies him&s;elf lo&s;ing his Exi&s;tence, and falling away into nothing, can never be &s;uf|ficiently admired. His Dream, in which he &s;till pre&s;erves the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his Exi&s;tence, toge|ther with his Removal into the Garden which was prepared for his Reception, are al&s;o Circum&s;tances finely imagined, and grounded upon what is deli|vered in &s;acred Story.</P>
<P>THESE and the like wonderful Incidents in this Part of the Work, have in them all the Beau|ties of Novelty, at the &s;ame Time that they have all the Graces of Nature. They are &s;uch as none but a great Genius could have thought of, though, upon the Peru&s;al of them, they &s;eem to ri&s;e of them&s;elves from the Subject of which he treats. In a Word, though they are natural they are not ob|vious,
<PB N="106" REF="105">
which is the true Character of all fine Wri|ting.</P>
<P>THE Impre&s;&s;ion which the Interdiction of the Tree of Life left in the Mind of our fir&s;t Parent, is de&s;cribed with great Strength and Judgment; as the Image of the &s;everal Bea&s;ts and Birds pa&s;&s;ing in Review before him is very beautiful and lively. <Q><L>&mdash;Each Bird and Bea&s;t behold</L>
<L>Approaching two and two, the&s;e cowring low</L>
<L>With Blandi&s;hment; each Bird &s;toop'd on his Wing:</L>
<L>I nam'd them as they pa&s;s'd&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>ADAM,</HI> in the next Place, de&s;cribes a Con|ference which he held with his Maker upon the Subject of Solitude. The Poet here repre&s;ents the &s;upreme Being, as making an E&s;&s;ay of his own Work, and putting to the Trial that rea&s;oning Fa|culty with which he had endued his Creature. <HI>A|dam</HI> urges, in this divine Colloquy, the Impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of his being happy, tho' he was the Inhabi|tant of <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> and Lord of the whole Creation, without the Conver&s;ation and Society of &s;ome ra|tional Creature, who &s;hould partake tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings with him. This Dialogue, which is &s;upported chief|ly by the Beauty of the Thoughts, without other poetical Ornaments, is as fine a Part as any in the whole Poem: The more the Reader examines the Ju&s;tne&s;s and Delicacy of its Sentiments, the more he will find him&s;elf plea&s;ed with it. The Poet has wonderfully pre&s;erved the Character of Maje&s;ty and Conde&s;cen&s;ion in the Creator, and at the &s;ame Time that of Humility and Adoration in the Crea|ture, as particularly in the following Lines, <Q><L>Thus I pre&s;umptuous; and the Vi&s;ion bright,</L>
<L>As with a Smile more brightned, thus reply'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L>
<L>&mdash;I with leave of Speech implor'd</L>
<L><PB N="107" REF="106">
And humble Deprecation thus reply'd.</L>
<L>Let not my Words offend thee, heavenly Power,</L>
<L>My Maker, be propitious while I &s;peak, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><HI>ADAM</HI> then proceeds to give an Account of his &s;econd Sleep, and of the Dream in which he beheld the Formation of <HI>Eve.</HI> The new Pa&s;&s;ion that was awakened in him at the Sight of her is touched very finely. <Q><L>&V;nder his forming Hands a Creature grew,</L>
<L>Manlike, but different Sex; &s;o lovely fair,</L>
<L>That what &s;eem'd fair in all the World &s;eem'd now</L>
<L>Mean, or in her &s;umm'd up, in her contain'd,</L>
<L>And in her Looks, which from that time infus'd</L>
<L>Sweetne&s;s into my Heart, unfelt before,</L>
<L>And into all things from her Air in&s;pir d</L>
<L>The Spirit of Love and amorous Delight.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>ADAM</HI>'s Di&s;tre&s;s upon lo&s;ing Sight of this beautiful Phantom, with his Exclamations of Joy and Gratitude at the Di&s;covery of a real Creature, who re&s;embled the Apparition which had been pre|&s;ented to him in his Dream; the Approaches he makes to her, and his Manner of Court&s;hip, are all laid together in a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Propriety of Sentiments.</P>
<P>THO' this Part of the Poem is work'd up with great Warmth and Spirit, the Love which is de&s;cri|bed in it is every way &s;uitable to a State of Inno|cence If the Reader compares the De&s;cription which <HI>Adam</HI> here gives of his leading <HI>Eve</HI> to the Nuptial Bower, with that which Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> has made on the &s;ame Occa&s;ion in a Scene of his <HI>Fall of Man,</HI> he will be &s;en&s;ible of the great Care which <HI>Milton</HI> took to avoid all Thoughts on &s;o delicate a Subject, that might be offen&s;ive to Religion or good Manners. The Sentiments are cha&s;te, but
<PB N="108" REF="107">
not cold, and convey to the Mind Ideas of the mo&s;t tran&s;porting Pa&s;&s;ion, and of the greate&s;t Pu|rity. What a Noble Mixture of Rapture and In|nocence has the Author joined together, in the Re|flection which <HI>Adam</HI> makes on the Plea&s;ures of Love, compared to tho&s;e of Sen&s;e. <Q><L>Thus have I told thee all my State, and brought</L>
<L>My Story to the Sum of earthly Bli&s;s</L>
<L>Which I enjoy, and mu&s;t confe&s;s to find</L>
<L>In all things el&s;e Delight indeed, but &s;uch</L>
<L>As us'd or not, works in the mind no Change,</L>
<L>Nor Vehement de&s;ire, the&s;e delicacies</L>

<L>About her, as a Guard angelick plac'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>THESE Sentiments of Love, in our fir&s;t Pa|rent, gave the Angel &s;uch an In&s;ight into humane Nature, that he &s;eems apprehen&s;ive of the Evils which might befal the Species in general, as well as <HI>Adam</HI> in particular, from the Exce&s;s of this Pa&s;&s;ion. He therefore fortifies him again&s;t it by timely Admonitions; which very artfully prepare the Mind of the Reader for the Occurrences of the next Book, where the Weakne&s;s, of which <HI>A|dam</HI> here gives &s;uch di&s;tant Di&s;coveries, brings about that fatal Event which is the Subject of the Po|em. His Di&s;cour&s;e, which follows the gentle Re|buke he receiv'd from the Angel, &s;hews that his Love, however violent it might appear, was &s;till founded in Rea&s;on, and con&s;equently not impro|per for <HI>Paradi&s;e.</HI> <Q><L>Neither her out&s;ide form &s;o fair, nor ought</L>

<P><HI>ADAM</HI>'s Speech, at parting with the Angel, has in it a Deference and Gratitude agreeable to an inferior Nature, and at the &s;ame Time a cer|tain Dignity and Greatne&s;s &s;uitable to the Father of Mankind in his State of Innocence.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>&mdash;In te omnis domus inclinata recumbit.</L><BIBL>Virg.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF we look into the three great Heroic Poems which have appear'd in the World, we may ob|&s;erve that they are built upon very &s;light Founda|tions. <HI>Homer</HI> lived near 300 Years after the <HI>Trojan</HI> War, and, as the Writing of Hi&s;tory was not then in u&s;e among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> we may very well &s;uppo&s;e, that the Tradition of <HI>Achilles</HI> and <HI>&V;ly&s;&s;es</HI> had brought down but very few Particulars to his Know|ledge, tho' there is no Que&s;tion but he has wrought into his two Poems &s;uch of their remarkable Ad|ventures as were &s;till talked of among his Con|temporaties,</P>
<P>THE Story of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> on which <HI>Virgil</HI> founded his Poem, was likewi&s;e very bare of Circum&s;tances, and by that Means afforded him an Opportunity of embelli&s;hing it with Fiction, and giving a full Range to his own Invention. We find, however, that he has interwoven, in the Cour&s;e, of his Fa|ble, the principal Particulars, which were generally believed among the <HI>Romans,</HI> of <HI>Aeneas</HI> his Voyage and Settlement in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>THE Reader may find an Abridgment of the whole Story as collected out of the ancient Hi&s;to|rians, and as it was received among the <HI>Romans,</HI> in <HI>Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;eus.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE none of the Criticks have con&s;idered <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Fable, with relation to this Hi&s;tory of <HI>Ae|neas;</HI> it may not, perhaps, be ami&s;s to examine it in this Light, &s;o far as regards my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e.
<PB N="111" REF="110">
Whoever looks into the Abridgment above-menti|oned, will find that the Character of <HI>Aeneas</HI> is filled with Piety to the Gods, and a &s;uper&s;titious Ob&s;er|vation of Prodigies, Oracles, and Predictions. <HI>Vir|gil</HI> has not only pre&s;erved this Character in the Per&s;on of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> but has given a Place in his Poem to tho&s;e particular Prophecies which he found recorded of him in Hi&s;tory and Tradition. The Poet took the Matters of Fact as they came down to him, and circum&s;tanced them after his own Manner, to make them appear the more natural, agreeable, or &s;urprizing. I believe very many Readers have been &s;hocked at that ludicrous Pro|phecy, which one of the <HI>Harpeys</HI> pronounces to the <HI>Trojans</HI> in the Third Book, namely, that before they had built their intended City, they &s;hould be reduced by Hunger to eat their very Tables. But, when they hear that this was one of the Circum|&s;tances that had been tran&s;mitted to the <HI>Romans</HI> in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> they will think the Poet did very well in taking Notice of it. The Hi&s;to|rian above-mentioned acquaints us, a Prophete&s;s had foretold <HI>Aeneas,</HI> that he &s;hould take his Voyage We&s;tward, till his Companions &s;hould eat their Ta|bles; and that accordingly, upon his landing in <HI>I|taly,</HI> as they were eating their Fle&s;h upon Cakes of Bread, for want of other Conveniencies, they afterwards fed on the Cakes them&s;elves; upon which one of the Company &s;aid merrily, <HI>We are eating our Tables.</HI> They immediately took the Hint, &s;ays the Hi&s;to|rian, and concluded the Prophecy to be fulfilled. As <HI>Virgil</HI> did not think it proper to omit &s;o mate|rial a Particular in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> it may be worth while to con&s;ider with how much Judg|ment he has qualified it, and taken off every thing that might have appeared improper for a Pa&s;&s;age in an Heroic Poem. The Prophete&s;s who foretells it is an hungry <HI>Harpy,</HI> as the Per&s;on who di&s;covers it is young <HI>A&s;canius.</HI> <Q><PB N="112" REF="111">

<P>SUCH an Ob&s;ervation, which is beautiful in the Mouth of a Boy, would have been ridiculous from any other of the Company. I am apt to think that the changing of the <HI>Trojan</HI> Fleet into Water-Nymphs, which is the mo&s;t violent Machine in the whole <HI>Aeneid,</HI> and has given Offence to &s;e|veral Criticks, may be accounted for the &s;ame way. <HI>Virgil</HI> him&s;elf, before he begins that Relation, pre|mi&s;es that what he was going to tell appeared in|credible, but that it was ju&s;tified by Tradition. What further confirms me that this Change of the Fleet was a celebrated Circum&s;tance in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Aeneas</HI> is, that <HI>Ovid</HI> has given a Place to the &s;ame <HI>Metamorpho&s;is</HI> in his Account of the heathen Mythology.</P>
<P>NONE of the Criticks I have met with having con&s;idered the Fable of the <HI>Aeneid</HI> in this Light, and taken Notice how the Tradition, on which it was founded, authorizes tho&s;e Parts in it which appear the mo&s;t exceptionable; I hope the Length of this Reflection will not make it unacceptable to the curious Part of my Readers.</P>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory, which was the Ba&s;is of <HI>Milton</HI>'s Poem, is &s;till &s;horter than either that of the <HI>Iliad</HI> or <HI>Aeneid.</HI> The Poet has likewi&s;e taken Care to in&s;ert every Circum&s;tance of it in the Body of his Fable. The Ninth Book, which we are here to con&s;ider, is rai&s;ed upon that brief Account in Scri|pture, wherein we are told that the Serpent was more &s;ubtle than any Bea&s;t of the Field, that he tempted the Woman to eat of the forbidden Fruit, that &s;he was overcome by this Temptation, and that <HI>Adam</HI> followed her Example. From the&s;e few Particulars <HI>Milton</HI> has formed one of the mo&s;t enter|taining Fables that Invention ever produced. He has di&s;po&s;ed of the&s;e &s;everal Circum&s;tances among &s;o
<PB N="113" REF="112">
many agreeable and natural Fictions of his own, that his whole Story looks only like a Comment upon &s;acred Writ, or rather &s;eems to be a full and com|pleat Relation of what the other is only an Epi|tome. I have in&s;i&s;ted the longer on this Con&s;idera|tion, as I look upon the Di&s;po&s;itionand Contrivance of the Fable to be the principal Beauty of the Ninth Book, which has more <HI>Story</HI> in it, and is fuller of Incidents, than any other in the whole Poem. <HI>Satan</HI>'s traver&s;ing the Globe, and &s;till keep|ing within the Shadow of the Night, as fearing to be di&s;covered by the Angel of the Sun, who had before detected him, is one of tho&s;e beautiful I|maginations with which he introduces this his &s;e|cond Series of Adventures. Having examined the Nature of every Creature, and found out one which was the mo&s;t proper for his Purpo&s;e, he again re|turns to Paradi&s;e; and, to avoid Di&s;covery, &s;inks by Night with a River that ran under the Garden, and ri&s;es up again through a Fountain that i&s;&s;ued from it by the Tree of Life. The Poet, who, as we have before taken Notice, &s;peaks as little as po&s;&s;ible in his own Per&s;on, and, after the Exam|ple of <HI>Homer,</HI> fills every Part of his Work with Manners and Characters, introduces a Soliloquy of this infernal Agent, who was thus re&s;tle&s;s in the De&s;truction of Man. He is then de&s;crib'd as gli|ding through the Garden under the Re&s;emblance of a Mi&s;t, in order to find out that Creature in which he de&s;ign'd to tempt our fir&s;t Parents. This De&s;cription has &s;omething in it very poetical and &s;urprizing. <Q><L>So &s;aying, through each Thicket dank or dry</L>
<L>Like a black Mi&s;t, low creeping, he held on</L>
<L>His midnight Search, where &s;oone&s;t he might find</L>
<L>The Serpent: him fa&s;t &s;leeping &s;oon he found</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="113">
In Labyrinth of many a round &s;elf-roll'd,</L>
<L>His head the mid&s;t, well &s;tor'd with &s;ubtle wiles.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Author afterwards gives us a De&s;cription of the Morning, which is wonderfully &s;uitable to a Divine Poem, and peculiar to that fir&s;t Sea&s;on of Nature: He repre&s;ents the Earth before it was cur&s;t as a great Altar breathing out its Incen&s;e from all Parts, and &s;ending up a plea&s;ant Savour to the No|&s;trils of its Creator; to which he adds a noble Idea of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> as offering their Morning Wor|&s;hip, and filling up the Univer&s;al Con&s;ort of Prai&s;e and Adoration. <Q><L>Now when as &s;acred Light began to dawn</L>
<L>In <HI>Eden</HI> on the humid Flowers, that breathed</L>
<L>Their Morning Incen&s;e, when all things that breath</L>
<L>From th' Earth's great Altar &s;end up &s;ilent Prai&s;e</L>
<L>To the Creator, and his No&s;trils fill</L>
<L>With grateful Smell; forth came the human Pair,</L>
<L>And joyn'd their vocal Wor&s;hip to the Choir</L>
<L>Of Creatures wanting Voice&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Di&s;pute which follows between our two fir&s;t Parents is repre&s;ented with great Art: It pro|ceeds from a Difference of Judgment, not of Pa&s;|&s;ion, and is managed with Rea&s;on, not with Heat: It is &s;uch a Di&s;pute as we may &s;uppo&s;e might have happened in <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> had Man conti|nued happy and innocent. There is a great Deli|cacy in the Moralities which are inter&s;per&s;ed in <HI>Adam</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e, and which the mo&s;t ordinary Reader cannot but take Notice of. That Force of Love which the Father of Mankind &s;o finely de|&s;cribes in the Eighth Book, and which is in&s;erted in the foregoing Paper, &s;hews it &s;elf here in ma|ny fine In&s;tances: As in tho&s;e fond Regards he ca&s;t towards <HI>Eve</HI> at her parting from him. <Q><PB N="115" REF="114">
<L>Her long with ardent look his Eye pur&s;ued</L>
<L>Delighted, but de&s;iring more her &s;tay.</L>
<L>Oft he to her his Charge of quick Return</L>
<L>Repeated; &s;he to him as oft engaged</L>
<L>To be return'd by Noon amid the Bowre.</L></Q></P>
<P>IN his Impatience and Amu&s;ement during her Ab&s;ence. <Q><L>&mdash;<HI>Adam</HI> the while</L>
<L>Waiting de&s;irous her Return, had wove</L>
<L>Of choice&s;t Flowers a Garland to adorn</L>
<L>Her Tre&s;&s;es, and her Rural Labours crown,</L>
<L>As Reapers oft are wont their Harve&s;t Queen.</L>
<L>Great Joy he promi&s;ed to his Thoughts, and new</L>
<L>Solace in her Return, &s;o long delay'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>BUT particularly in that pa&s;&s;ionate Speech, where &s;eeing her irrecoverably lo&s;t, he re&s;olves to peri&s;h with her rather than to live without her. <Q><L>&mdash;Some cur&s;ed Fraud</L>
<L>Or Enemy hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown,</L>
<L>And me with thee hath ruin'd, for with Thee</L>
<L>Certain my Re&s;olution is to Die;</L>
<L>How can I live without thee, how forego</L>
<L>Thy &s;weet Conver&s;e, and Love &s;o dearly joyn'd,</L>
<L>To live again in the&s;e wild Woods forlorn?</L>
<L>Should God create another <HI>Eve,</HI> and I</L>
<L>Another Rib afford, yet lo&s;s of thee</L>
<L>Would never from my Heart; no, no, I feel</L>
<L>The link of Nature draw me: Fle&s;h of Fle&s;h,</L>
<L>Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State</L>
<L>Mine never &s;hall be parted, Bli&s;s or Woe.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Beginning of this Speech, and the Prepa|ration to it are animated with the &s;ame Spirit as the Conclu&s;ion, which I have here quoted,</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="115">
THE &s;everal Wiles which are put in Practice by the Tempter, when he found <HI>Eve</HI> &s;eparated from her Husband, the many plea&s;ing Images of Nature which are intermixt in this Part of the Story, with its gradual and regular Progre&s;s to the fatal Cata|&s;trophe, are &s;o very remarkable, that it would be &s;uperfluous to point out their re&s;pective Beauties.</P>
<P>I have avoided mentioning any particular Simi|litudes in my Remarks on this great Work, becau&s;e I have given a general Account of them in my Paper on the Fir&s;t Book. There is one, however, in this Part of the Poem which I &s;hall here quote, as it is not only very beautiful, but the clo&s;e&s;t of any in the whole Poem; I mean that where the Serpent is de&s;crib'd as rolling forward in all his Pride, animated by the evil Spirit, and conducting <HI>Eve</HI> to her De&s;truction, while <HI>Adam</HI> was at too great a Di&s;tance from her to give her his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e &s;everal Particulars are all of them wrought into the following Similitude. <Q><L>&mdash;Hope elevates, and Joy</L>
<L>Brightens his Cre&s;t; as when a wand'ring Fire</L>
<L>Compact of unctuous Vapour, which the Night</L>
<L>Conden&s;es, and the Cold invirons round,</L>
<L>Kindled through agitation to a Flame;</L>
<L>(Which oft, they &s;ay, &s;ome evil Spirit attends)</L>
<L>Hovering and blazing with delu&s;ive Light,</L>
<L>Mi&s;leads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way</L>
<L>To Bogs and Mires, and oft thro' Pond or Pool,</L>
<L>There &s;wallow'd up and lo&s;t, from Succour far,</L></Q></P>
<P>THAT &s;ecret Intoxication of Plea&s;ure, with all tho&s;e tran&s;ient Flu&s;hings of Guilt and Joy which the Poet repre&s;ents in our fir&s;t Parents upon their eating the forbidden Fruit, to tho&s;e Flaggings of Spirit, Damps of Sorrow, and mutual Accu&s;ations which &s;ucceed it, are conceiv'd with a wonderful
<PB N="117" REF="116">
Imagination, and de&s;cribed in very natural Senti|ments.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Dido</HI> in the Fourth <HI>Aeneid</HI> yielded to that fatal Temptation which ruin'd her, <HI>Virgil</HI> tells us the Earth trembled, the Heavens were filled with Fla&s;hes of Lightning, and the Nymphs howled upon the Mountain Tops. <HI>Milton,</HI> in the &s;ame po|etical Spirit, has de&s;cribed all Nature as di&s;turbed upon <HI>Eve</HI>'s eating the forbidden Fruit. <Q><L>So &s;aying, her ra&s;h Hand in evil Hour</L>
<L>Forth reaching to the Fruit, &s;he pluckt, &s;he eat:</L>
<L>Earth felt the Wound, and Nature from her Seat</L>
<L>Sighing thro' all her Works gave Signs of Woe</L>
<L>That all was lo&s;t&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>UPON <HI>Adam</HI>'s falling into the &s;ame Guilt, the whole Creation appears a &s;econd time in Convul|&s;ions. <Q><L>&mdash;He &s;crupled not to eat</L>
<L>Again&s;t his better Knowledge, not deceiv'd,</L>
<L>But fondly overcome with Female Charm.</L>
<L>Earth trembled from her Entrails, as again</L>
<L>In Pangs, and Nature gave a &s;econd Groan,</L>
<L>SKY lowred, and, muttering Thunder, &s;ome &s;ad Drops</L>
<L>Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>AS all Nature &s;uffer'd by the Guilt of our fir&s;t Parents, the&s;e Symptoms of Trouble and Con&s;ter|nation are wonderfully imagined, not only as Pro|digies, but as Marks of her &s;ympathizing in the Fall of Man.</P>
<P><HI>ADAM</HI>'s Conver&s;e with <HI>Eve,</HI> after having eaten the forbidden Fruit, is an exact Copy of that between <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Juno</HI> in the Fourteenth <HI>Iliad. Juno</HI> there approaches <HI>Jupiter</HI> with the Girdle which &s;he had received from <HI>Venus;</HI> upon which he tells her, that &s;he appeared more charming and de|&s;irable
<PB N="118" REF="117">
than &s;he had ever done before, even when their Loves were at the highe&s;t. The Poet after|wards de&s;cribes them as repo&s;ing on a Summet of Mount <HI>Ida,</HI> which produced under them a Bed of Flowers, the <HI>Lotus,</HI> the <HI>Crocus,</HI> and the <HI>Hyacinth,</HI> and concludes his De&s;cription with their falling a&s;leep.</P>
<P>LET the Reader compare this with the follow|ing Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Milton,</HI> which begins with <HI>Adam</HI>'s Speech to <HI>Eve.</HI> <Q><L>For never did thy Beauty &s;ince the Day</L>
<L>I &s;aw thee fir&s;t and wedded thee, adorn'd</L>
<L>With all Perfections, &s;o inflame my Sen&s;e</L>
<L>With Ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now</L>
<L>Than ever, bounty of this virtuous Tree.</L>
<L>So &s;aid be, and forbore not glance or toy</L>
<L>Of amorous Intent, well under&s;tood</L>
<L>Of <HI>Eve,</HI> who&s;e Eye darted contagious fire.</L>
<L>Her hand he &s;ei&s;ed, and to a &s;hady bank</L>
<L>Thick over-head with verdant roof embowr'd</L>
<L>He led her nothing loath: Flow'rs were the Couch,</L>
<L>Pan&s;ies, and Violets, and A&s;phodel,</L>
<L>And Hyacinth, Earth's fre&s;he&s;t &s;ofte&s;t Lap.</L>
<L>There they their fill of Love, and Love's di&s;port</L>
<L>Took largely, of their mutual guilt the Seal,</L>
<L>The Solace of their Sin, till dewy Sleep</L>
<L>Oppre&s;s'd them&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>AS no Poet &s;eems ever to have &s;tudied <HI>Homer</HI> more, or to have re&s;embled him in the Greatne&s;s of Genius than <HI>Milton,</HI> I think I &s;hould have given but a very imperfect Account of his Beauties, if I had not ob&s;erved the mo&s;t remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages which look like Parallels in the&s;e two great Au|thors. I might, in the Cour&s;e of the&s;e Critici&s;ms, have taken Notice of many particular Lines and Expre&s;&s;ions which are tran&s;lated from the <HI>Greek</HI> Po|et;
<PB N="119" REF="118">
but as I thought this would have appeared too minute and over-curious, I have purpo&s;ely omitted them. The greater Incidents, however, are not on|ly &s;et off by being &s;hown in the &s;ame Light with &s;everal of the &s;ame Nature in <HI>Homer,</HI> but by that means may be al&s;o guarded again&s;t the Cavils of the Ta&s;tele&s;s or Ignorant.</P>

<P>THE Tenth Book of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> has a greater Variety of Per&s;ons in it than any other in the whole Poem. The Author upon the winding up of his Action introduces all tho&s;e who had any Con|cern in it, and &s;hews with great Beauty the Influ|ence which it had upon each of them. It is like the la&s;t Act of a well written Tragedy, in which all who had a Part in it are generally drawn up be|fore the Audience, and repre&s;ented under tho&s;e Circum&s;tances in which the Determination of the Action places them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore con&s;ider this Book under four Heads, in relation to the Cele&s;tial, the Infernal, the Human, and the Imaginary Per&s;ons, who have their re&s;pective Parts allotted in it.</P>
<P>TO begin with the Cele&s;tial Per&s;ons: The Guar|dian Angels of <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> are de&s;cribed as returning to Heaven upon the Fall of Man, in order to ap|prove their Vigilance; their Arrival, their Manner of Reception, with the Sorrow which appeared in them&s;elves, and in tho&s;e Spirits who are &s;aid to
<PB N="120" REF="119">
Rejoice at the Conver&s;ion of a Sinner, are very fine|ly laid together in the following Lines. <Q><L>&V;p into Heav'n from Paradi&s;e in ha&s;te</L>
<L>Th' angelick guards a&s;cended, mute and &s;ad</L>
<L>For Man, for of his &s;tate by this they knew,</L>
<L>Much wond'ring how the &s;ubtle Fiend had &s;toln</L>
<L>Entrance un&s;een. Soon as th' unwelcome news</L>
<L>From Earth arriv'd at Heaven Gate, di&s;pleas'd</L>
<L>All were who heard, dim &s;adne&s;s did not &s;pare</L>
<L>That time Cele&s;tial vi&s;ages, yet mixt</L>
<L>With pity, violated not their Bli&s;s.</L>
<L>About the new-arriv'd, in multitudes</L>
<L>Th' Aethereal People ran, to hear and know</L>
<L>How all befell: They tow'rds the Throne &s;upream</L>
<L>Accountable made ha&s;te to make appear</L>
<L>With righteous plea, their utmo&s;t vigilance,</L>
<L>And ea&s;ily approv'd; when the mo&s;t High</L>
<L>Eternal Father from his &s;ecret Cloud</L>
<L>Amid&s;t, in thunder utter'd thus his Voice.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE &s;ame Divine Per&s;on, who in the foregoing Parts of this Poem interceded for our fir&s;t Parents before their Fall, overthrew the Rebel Angels, and created the World, is now repre&s;ented as de&s;cend|ing to <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> and pronouncing Sentence upon the three Offenders. The cool of the Evening, being a Circum&s;tance with which Holy Writ introduces this great Scene, it is Poetically de&s;cribed by our Author, who has al&s;o kept religiou&s;ly to the Form of Words, in which the three &s;everal Sentences were pa&s;&s;ed upon <HI>Adam, Eve,</HI> and the Serpent. He has rather cho&s;en to neglect the Numerou&s;ne&s;s of his Ver&s;e, than to deviate from tho&s;e Speeches which are recorded on this great Occa&s;ion. The Guilt and Confu&s;ion of our fir&s;t Parents &s;tanding naked before their Judge, is touched with great Beauty. Upon the Arrival of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> into the Works
<PB N="121" REF="120">
of the Creation, the Almighty is again introduced as &s;peaking to his Angels that &s;urrounded him. <Q><L>See with what heat the&s;e Dogs of Hell advance</L>
<L>To wa&s;te and havock yonder World, which I</L>
<L>So fair and good Created, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>THE following Pa&s;&s;age is formed upon that glorious Image in Holy Writ, which compares the Voice of an innumerable Ho&s;t of Angels, uttering Hallelujahs, to the Voice of mighty Thunderings, or of many Waters. <Q><L>He ended, and the Heav'nly Audience loud</L>
<L>Sung Hallelujah, as the &s;ound of Seas,</L>
<L>Through multitude that &s;ung: "Ju&s;t are thy ways,</L>
<L>"Righteous are thy Decrees in all thy Works,</L>
<L>"Who can extenuate Thee&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>THOUGH the Author in the whole Cour&s;e of his Poem, and particularly in the Book we are now examining, has infinite Allu&s;ions to Places of Scri|pture, I have only taken notice in my Remarks of &s;uch as are of a Poetical Nature, and which are woven with great Beauty into the Body of this Fa|ble. Of this kind is that Pa&s;&s;age in the pre&s;ent Book, where de&s;cribing <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> as marching through the works of Nature, he adds, <Q><L>&mdash;Behind her <HI>Death</HI></L>
<L>Clo&s;e following pace for pace, not mounted yet</L>
<L>On his pale Hor&s;e!&mdash;</L></Q> Which alludes to that Pa&s;&s;age in Scripture &s;o won|derfully Poetical, and terrifying to the Imagination. <HI>And I looked, and behold a pale Hor&s;e, and his Name that &s;at on him was</HI> Death, <HI>and</HI> Hell <HI>followed with him: and Power was given unto them over the fourth Part of the Earth to kill with Sword, and with Hun|ger, and with Sickne&s;s, and with the Bea&s;ts of the Earth.</HI> Under this fir&s;t Head of Cele&s;tial Per&s;ons
<PB N="122" REF="121">
we mu&s;t likewi&s;e take Notice of the Command which the Angels received, to produce the &s;everal Changes in Nature, and &s;ully the Beauty of the Creation. Accordingly they are repre&s;ented as in|fecting the Stars and Planets with malignant In|fluences, weakning the Light of the Sun, bringing down the Winter into the milder Regions of Na|ture, planting Winds and Storms in &s;everal Quar|ters of the Sky, &s;toring the Clouds with Thunder, and in &s;hort, perverting the whole Frame of the U|niver&s;e to the Condition of its Criminal Inhabi|tants. As this is a noble Incident in the Poem, the following Lines, in which we &s;ee the Angels heaving up the Earth, and placing it in a diffe|rent Po&s;ture to the Sun from what it had before the Fall of Man, is conceived with that &s;ublime Imagination which was &s;o peculiar to this great Author. <Q><L>Some &s;ay he bid his Angels turn a&s;cance</L>
<L>The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more</L>
<L>From the Sun's Axle; they with labour pu&s;h'd</L>
<L>Oblique the Centrick Globe.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>WE are in the &s;econd Place, to con&s;ider the In|fernal Agents under the View which <HI>Milton</HI> has given us of them in this Book. It is ob&s;erved by tho&s;e who would &s;et forth the Greatne&s;s of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Plan, that he conducts his Reader through all the Parts of the Earth which were di&s;covered in his Time. <HI>A&s;ia, Africk,</HI> and <HI>Europe</HI> are the &s;everal Scenes of his Fable. The Plan of <HI>Milton</HI>'s Poem is of an infinitely greater Extent, and fills the Mind with many more a&s;toni&s;hing Circum&s;tances. <HI>Satan,</HI> having &s;urrounded the Earth &s;even times, departs at length from <HI>Paradi&s;e.</HI> We then &s;ee him &s;teering his Cour&s;e among the Con&s;tellations, and after ha|ving traver&s;ed the whole Creation, pur&s;uing his Voyage thro' the <HI>Chaos,</HI> and entering into his own Infernal Dominions.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="122">
HIS fir&s;t Appearance in the A&s;&s;embly of Fallen Angels, is work'd up with Circum&s;tances which give a delightful Surprize to the Reader; but there is no Incident in the whole Poem which does this more than the Transformation of the whole Audience, that follows the Account their Leader gives them of his Expedition. The gradual Change of <HI>Satan</HI> him&s;elf is de&s;cribed after <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Manner, and may vie with any of tho&s;e celebrated Transformations which are looked upon as the mo&s;t Beautiful Parts in that Poet's Works. <HI>Milton</HI> never fails of im|proving his own Hints, and be&s;towing the la&s;t fi|ni&s;hing Touches to every Incident which is admit|ted into his Poem. The unexpected Hi&s;s which ri&s;es in this Epi&s;ode, the Dimen&s;ions and Bulk of <HI>Satan</HI> &s;o much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the Infernal Spirits who lay under the &s;ame Transformation, with the annual Change which they are &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;uffer, are In&s;tances of this Kind. The Beauty of the Di|ction is very remarkable in this whole Epi&s;ode, as I have ob&s;erved in the Sixth Paper of the&s;e Re|marks the great Judgment with which it was con|trived.</P>
<P>THE Parts of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> or the Humane Per&s;ons, come next under our Con&s;ideration. <HI>Mil|ton</HI>'s Art is no where more &s;hewn than in his con|ducting the Parts of the&s;e our fir&s;t Parents. The Repre&s;entation he gives of them, without fal&s;ifying the Story, is wonderfully contrived to influence the Reader with Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion towards them. Though <HI>Adam</HI> involves the whole Species in Mi&s;ery, his Crime proceeds from a Weakne&s;s which every Man is inclined to pardon and com|mi&s;erate, as it &s;eems rather the Frailty of Humane Nature, than of the Per&s;on who offended. Every one is apt to excu&s;e a Fault which he him&s;elf might have fallen into. It was the Exce&s;s of Love for <HI>Eve</HI> that ruin'd <HI>Adam</HI> and his Po&s;terity. I need

not add, that the Author is Ju&s;tify'd in this Parti|cular by many of the Fathers, and the mo&s;t Ortho|dox Writers. <HI>Milton</HI> has by this means filled a great part of his Poem with that kind of Writing which the <HI>French</HI> Criticks call the <HI>Tender,</HI> and which is in a particular manner engaging to all &s;orts of Readers.</P>
<P><HI>ADAM</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> in the Book we are now con|&s;idering, are likewi&s;e drawn with &s;uch Sentiments as do not only intere&s;t the Reader in their Affli|ctions, but rai&s;e in him the mo&s;t melting Pa&s;&s;ions of Humanity and Commi&s;eration.

<HI>ADAM</HI>'s Reconcilement to her is work'd up in the &s;ame Spirit of Tenderne&s;s. <HI>Eve</HI> afterwards propo&s;es to her Husband, in the Blindne&s;s of her De&s;pair, that to prevent their Guilt from de&s;cend|ing upon Po&s;terity they &s;hould re&s;olve to live Child|le&s;s; or, if that could not be done, they &s;hould &s;eek their own Deaths by violent Methods. As tho&s;e Sentiments naturally engage the Reader to regard the Mother of Mankind with more than ordinary Commi&s;eration, they likewi&s;e contain a very fine Moral. The Re&s;olution of Dying, to end our Mi&s;e|ries, does not &s;hew &s;uch a degree of Magnanimity as a Re&s;olution to bear them, and &s;ubmit to the Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence.

<P>WE are, in the la&s;t Place, to con&s;ider the Ima|ginary Per&s;ons, or <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Sin,</HI> who act a large Part in this Book. Such beautiful extended Allego|ries are certainly &s;ome of the fine&s;t Compo&s;itions of Genius; but, as I have before ob&s;erved, are not agreeable to the Nature of an Heroic Poem. This of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> is very exqui&s;ite in its Kind, if not con&s;idered as a Part of &s;uch a Work. The Truths contained in it are &s;o clear and open, that I &s;hall not lo&s;e Time in explaining them; but &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that a Reader who knows the Strength of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, will be amazed to think how the Poet could find &s;uch apt Words and Phra&s;es to de&s;cribe the Actions of tho&s;e two imaginary Per|&s;ons, and particularly in that Part where <HI>Death</HI> is exhibited as forming a Bridge over the <HI>Chaos;</HI> a Work &s;uitable to the Genius of <HI>Milton.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE the Subject I am upon gives me an Op|portunity of &s;peaking more at large of &s;uch Sha|dowy and Imaginary Per&s;ons as may be introduced into Heroic Poems, I &s;hall beg Leave to explain my
<PB N="128" REF="127">
&s;elf in a Matter which is curious in its Kind, and which none of the Criticks have treated of. It is certain <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> are full of imaginary Per|&s;ons, who are very beautiful in Poetry when they are ju&s;t &s;hewn without being engaged in any Series of Action. <HI>Homer</HI> indeed repre&s;ents <HI>Sleep</HI> as a Per|&s;on, and a&s;cribes a &s;hort Part to him in his <HI>Iliad;</HI> but we mu&s;t con&s;ider that tho' we now regard &s;uch a Per&s;on as entirely &s;hadowy and un&s;ub&s;tantial, the Heathens made Statues of him, placed him in their Temples, and looked upon him as a Real Deity. When <HI>Homer</HI> makes u&s;e of other &s;uch Allegorical Per&s;ons, it is only in &s;hort Expre&s;&s;ions, which con|vey an ordinary Thought to the Mind in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing Manner, and may rather be looked upon as Poetical Phra&s;es than Allegorical De&s;criptions. In&s;tead of telling us that Men naturally fly when they are terrified, he introduces the Per&s;ons of <HI>Flight</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI> who, he tells us, are in&s;eparable Compa|nions. In&s;tead of &s;aying that the Time was come when <HI>Apollo</HI> ought to have received his Recom|pence, he tells us that the <HI>Hours</HI> brought him his Reward. In&s;tead of de&s;cribing the Effects which <HI>Minerva</HI>'s <HI>Aegis</HI> produced in Battel, he tells us that the Brims of it were encompa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Terrour, Rout, Di&s;cord, Fury, Pur&s;uit, Ma&s;&s;acre,</HI> and <HI>Death.</HI> In the &s;ame Figure of &s;peaking, he repre&s;ents <HI>Victory</HI> as following <HI>Diomedes; Di&s;cord</HI> as the Mother of Fu|nerals and Mourning; <HI>Venus</HI> as dre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Graces; Bellona</HI> as wearing Terrour and Con&s;ternation like a Garment. I might give &s;everal other In&s;tances out of <HI>Homer,</HI> as well as a great many out of <HI>Vir|gil. Milton</HI> has likewi&s;e very often made u&s;e of the &s;ame way of Speaking, as where he tells us, that <HI>Vi|ctory</HI> &s;at on the Right Hand of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> when he marched forth again&s;t the Rebel Angels; that at the ri&s;ing of the Sun the <HI>Hours</HI> unbarr'd the Gates of Light; that <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> was the Daughter of <HI>Sin.</HI>
<PB N="129" REF="128">
Of the &s;ame Nature are tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, where de&s;cribing the Singing of the Nightingale, he adds, <HI>Silence was plea&s;ed;</HI> and upon the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>'s bidding Peace to the <HI>Chaos, Confu&s;ion heard his Voice.</HI> I might add innumerable In&s;tances of our Poet's writing in this beautiful Figure. It is plain that the&s;e I have mentioned, in which Per&s;ons of an imaginary Nature are introduced, are &s;uch &s;hort Allegories as are not de&s;igned to be taken in the literal Sen&s;e, but only to convey particular Cir|cum&s;tances to the Reader after an unu&s;ual and en|tertaining Manner. But when &s;uch Per&s;ons are in|troduced as principal Actors, and engaged in a Se|ries of Adventures, they take too much upon them, and are by no means proper for an Heroic Poem, which ought to appear credible in its principal Parts. I cannot forbear therefore thinking that <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> are as improper Agents in a Work of this Nature, as <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> in one of the Tragedies of <HI>E&s;chylus,</HI> who repre&s;ented tho&s;e two Per&s;ons nailing down <HI>Prometheus</HI> to a Rock, for which he has been ju&s;tly cen&s;ured by the greate&s;t Criticks. I do not know any imaginary Per&s;on made u&s;e of in a more &s;ublime manner of Think|ing than that in one of the Prophets, who de|&s;cribing God as de&s;cending from Heaven, and vi|&s;iting the Sins of Mankind, adds that dreadful Circum&s;tance, <HI>Before him went the Pe&s;tilence.</HI> It is certain this imaginary Per&s;on might have been de|&s;cribed in all her purple Spots. The <HI>Fever</HI> might have marched before her, <HI>Pain</HI> might have &s;tood at her Right Hand, <HI>Phrenzy</HI> on her Left, and <HI>Death</HI> in her Rear. She might have been intro|duced as gliding down from the Tail of a Comet, or darted upon the Earth in a Fla&s;h of Lightning: She might have tainted the Atmo&s;phere with her Breath; the very Glaring of her Eyes might have &s;cattered. Infection. But I believe every Reader will
<PB N="130" REF="129">
think, that in &s;uch &s;ublime Writings the mentioning of her as it is done in Scripture, has &s;omething in it more ju&s;t, as well as great, than all that the mo&s;t fanciful Poet could have be&s;towed upon her in the Richne&s;s of his Imagination.</P>

<P><HI>MILTON</HI> has &s;hewn a wonderful Art in de|&s;cribing that Variety of Pa&s;&s;ions which ari&s;e in our fir&s;t Parents upon the Breach of the Com|mandment that had been given them. We &s;ee them gradually pa&s;&s;ing from the Triumph of their Guilt thro' Remor&s;e, Shame, De&s;pair, Contrition, Prayer, and Hope, to a perfect and compleat Repentance. At the End of the Tenth Book they are repre&s;ent|ed as pro&s;trating them&s;elves upon the Ground, and watering the Earth with their Tears: To which the Poet joins this beautiful Circum&s;tance, that they offer'd up their penitential Prayers on the very Place where their Judge appeared to them when he pro|nounced their Sentence. <Q><L>&mdash;They forthwith to the place</L>
<L>Repairing where he judg'd them, pro&s;trate fell</L>

<P>AS the Author never fails to give a poetical Turn to his Sentiments, he de&s;cribes in the Begin|ning of this Book the Acceptance which the&s;e their Prayers met with, in a &s;hort Allegory form'd upon that beautiful Pa&s;&s;age in Holy Writ; <Q REND="inline"><HI>And another Angel came and &s;tood at the Altar, having a golden Cen&s;er; and there was given unto him much incen&s;e, that he &s;hould offer it with the Prayers of all Saints upon the Golden Altar, which was before the Throne: And the &s;moak of the incen&s;e which came with the Prayers of the Saints a&s;cended up before God.</HI></Q> <Q><L>&mdash;To Heav'n their Prayers</L>

<P>WE have the &s;ame Thought expre&s;&s;ed a &s;econd Time in the Interce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> which is conceived in very emphatick Sentiments and Ex|pre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>AMONG the poetical Parts of Scripture which <HI>Milton</HI> has &s;o finely wrought into this Part of his Narration, I mu&s;t not omit that wherein <HI>Ezekiel</HI> &s;peaking of the Angels who appeared to him in a Vi&s;ion, adds, that <HI>every one had four faces,</HI> and that <HI>their whole bodies, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings were full of eyes round about.</HI> <Q><PB N="132" REF="131">

<P>THE a&s;&s;embling of all the Angels of Heaven to hear the &s;olemn Decree pa&s;&s;ed upon Man, is re|pre&s;ented in very lively Ideas. The Almighty is here de&s;crib'd as remembring Mercy in the mid&s;t of Judgment, and commanding <HI>Michael</HI> to deliver his Me&s;&s;age in the milde&s;t Terms, lea&s;t the Spirit of Man, which was already broken with the Sen&s;e of his Guilt and Mi&s;ery, &s;hould fail before him. <Q><L>&mdash;Yet lea&s;t they faint</L>

The Poet, to &s;hew the like Changes in Nature, as well as to grace his Fable with a noble Prodigy, repre&s;ents the Sun in an Eclip&s;e. This particular Incident has likewi&s;e a fine Effect upon the Imagination of the Reader, in regard to what follows; for at the &s;ame Time that the Sun is under an Eclip&s;e, a bright Cloud de|&s;cends in the We&s;tern Quarter of the Heavens, fil|led with an Ho&s;t of Angels, and more luminous than the Sun it &s;elf.

<P>THE Angel afterwards leads <HI>Adam</HI> to the high|e&s;t Mount of <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> and lays before him a whole Hemi&s;phere, as a proper Stage for tho&s;e Vi&s;ions which were to be repre&s;ented on it. I have before ob&s;erved how the Plan of <HI>Milton</HI>'s Poem is in ma|ny particulars greater than that of the <HI>Iliad</HI> or <HI>Ae|neid. Virgil</HI>'s Hero, in the la&s;t of the&s;e Poems, is entertained with a &s;ight of all the&s;e who are to de|&s;cend from him; but tho' that Epi&s;ode is ju&s;tly admired as one of the noble&s;t De&s;igns in the whole <HI>Aeneid,</HI> every one mu&s;t allow that this of <HI>Milton</HI> is of a much higher Nature. <HI>Adam</HI>'s Vi&s;ion is not confined to any particular Tribe of Mankind, but extends to the whole Species.</P>
<P>IN this great Review which <HI>Adam</HI> takes of all his Sons and Daughters, the fir&s;t Objects he is pre|&s;ented with exhibit to him the Story of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel,</HI> which is drawn together with much Clo&s;ene&s;s and Propriety of Expre&s;&s;ion. That Curio&s;ity and natural Horror which ari&s;es in <HI>Adam</HI> at the Sight of the fir&s;t Dying Man, is touched with great Beauty. <Q><L>But have I now &s;een Death? is this the way</L>
<L>I mu&s;t return to native du&s;t? O Sight</L>
<L>Of terrour foul and ugly to behold,</L>
<L>Horrid to Think, how horrible to Feel!</L></Q></P>
<P>THE &s;econd Vi&s;ion &s;ets before him the Image of Death in a great Variety of Appearances. The Angel, to give him a general Idea of tho&s;e Effects which his Guilt had brought upon his Po&s;terity, places before him a large Ho&s;pital, or Lazar-Hou&s;e,
<PB N="136" REF="135">
fill'd with Per&s;ons lying under all kinds of mortal Di&s;ea&s;es. How finely has the Poet told us that the &s;ick Per&s;ons langui&s;hed under lingring and incura|ble Di&s;tempers, by an apt and judicious u&s;e of &s;uch imaginary Beings as tho&s;e I mentioned in my la&s;t Paper. <Q><L>Dire was the to&s;&s;ing, deep the Groans, <HI>De&s;pair</HI></L>
<L>Tended the Sick, bu&s;y from Couch to Couch;</L>
<L>And over them triumphant <HI>Death</HI> his dart</L>
<L>Shook, but delay'd to &s;trike, though oft invoked</L>
<L>With Vows as their chief good and final hope.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Pa&s;&s;ion which likewi&s;e ri&s;es in <HI>Adam</HI> on this occa&s;ion is very natural. <Q><L>Sight &s;o deform what Heart of rock could long</L>
<L>Dry-eyed behold? <HI>Adam</HI> could not, but wept,</L>
<L>Tho' not of Woman born; Compa&s;&s;ion quell'd</L>
<L>His be&s;t of Man, and gave him up to tears.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Di&s;cour&s;e between the Angel and <HI>Adam</HI> which follows, abounds with noble Morals.</P>
<P>AS there is nothing more delightful in Poetry than a Contra&s;t and Oppo&s;ition of Incidents, the Author, after this melancholy Pro&s;pect of Death and Sickne&s;s, rai&s;es up a Scene of Mirth, Love and Jollity. The &s;ecret Plea&s;ure that &s;teals into <HI>A|dam</HI>'s Heart as he is intent upon this Vi&s;ion, is i|magined with great Delicacy. I mu&s;t not omit the De&s;cription of the loo&s;e female Troupe, who &s;edu|ced the Sons of God as they are called in Scripture. <Q><L>For that fair female troupe thou &s;aw'&s;t, that &s;eem'd</L>
<L>Of Godde&s;&s;es, &s;o blithe, &s;o &s;mooth, &s;o gay,</L>
<L>Yet empty of all good, wherein con&s;i&s;ts</L>
<L>Woman's dome&s;tick honour and chief prai&s;e;</L>
<L>Bred only and compleated to the ta&s;te</L>
<L>Of lu&s;tful appetence, to &s;ing, to dance,</L>
<L>To dre&s;s and troule the Tongue, and roul the Eye.</L>
<L><PB N="137" REF="136">

<L>Of tho&s;e fair Athei&s;ts&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>THE next Vi&s;ion is of a quite contrary Nature, and filled with the Horrors of War. <HI>Adam</HI> at the Sight of it melts into Tears, and breaks out in that pa&s;&s;ionate Speech, <Q><L>&mdash;O what are the&s;e</L>
<L>Death's mini&s;ters, not Men: who thus deal death</L>
<L>Inhumanly to Men, and multiply</L>
<L>Ten thou&s;and fold the Sin of him who flew</L>
<L>His Brother: for of whom &s;uch Ma&s;&s;acre</L>
<L>Make they but of their Brethren, Men of Men?</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>MILTON,</HI> to keep up an agreeable Variety in his Vi&s;ions, after having rai&s;ed in the Mind of his Rea|der the &s;everal Ideas of Terror which are conform|able to the De&s;cription of War: pa&s;&s;es on to tho&s;e &s;ofter Images of Triumphs and Fe&s;tivals, in that Vi&s;ion of Lewdne&s;s and Luxury which u&s;hers in the Flood.</P>
<P>AS it is vi&s;ible that the Poet had his Eye upon <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Account of the univer&s;al Deluge, the Rea|der may ob&s;erve with how much Judgment he has avoided every thing that is redundant or puerile in the <HI>Latin</HI> Poet. We do not here &s;ee the Wolf &s;wimming among the Sheep, nor any of tho&s;e wan|ton Imaginations which <HI>Seneca</HI> found fault with, as unbecoming the great Cata&s;trophe of Nature. If our Poet has imitated that Ver&s;e in which <HI>Ovid</HI> tells us that there was nothing but Sea, and that this Sea had no Shore to it, he has not &s;et the Thought in &s;uch a Light as to incur the Cen&s;ure which Cri|ticks have pa&s;&s;ed upon it. The latter part of that Ver&s;e in <HI>Ovid</HI> is idle and &s;uperfluous, but ju&s;t and beautiful in <HI>Milton.</HI> <Q><PB N="138" REF="137">

<P>IN <HI>Milton</HI> the former part of the De&s;cription does not fore&s;tall the latter. How much more great and &s;olemn on this Occa&s;ion is that which follows in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poet, <Q><L>&mdash;And in their Palaces</L>
<L>Where Luxury late reign'd, Sea Mon&s;ters whelp'd</L>
<L>And &s;tabl'd&mdash;</L></Q> than that in <HI>Ovid,</HI> where we are told that the Sea-Calfs lay in tho&s;e Places where the Goats were u|&s;ed to browze? The Reader may find &s;everal other parallel pa&s;&s;ages in the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> De&s;crip|tion of the Deluge; wherein our Poet has vi&s;ibly the Advantage. The Sky's being over charged with Clouds, the de&s;cending of the Rains, the ri&s;ing of the Seas, and the appearance of the Rainbow, are &s;uch De&s;criptions as every one mu&s;t take Notice of. The Circum&s;tance relating to <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> is &s;o finely imagined and &s;uitable to the Opinions of many learned Authors, that I cannot forbear giv|ing it a Place in this Paper. <Q><L>&mdash;Then &s;hall this mount</L>
<L>Of Paradi&s;e by might of waves be mov'd</L>
<L>Out of his place, pu&s;h'd by the horned &s;tood,</L>
<L>With all his verdure &s;poil'd, and trees adrift</L>
<L>Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf,</L>
<L>And there take root an I&s;land &s;alt and bare,</L>
<L>The haunt of Seals and Orcs and Sea-Mews clang.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Tran&s;ition which the Poet makes from the Vi&s;ion of the Deluge, to the Concern it occa&s;ioned in <HI>Adam,</HI> is exqui&s;itely graceful, and copied after
<PB N="139" REF="138">

<P>I have been the more particular in my Quotati|ons out of the Eleventh Book of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e it is not generally reckoned among the mo&s;t &s;hining Books of this Poem; for which Rea|&s;on the Reader might be apt to overlook tho&s;e many Pa&s;&s;ages in it which de&s;erve our Admiration. The Eleventh and Twelfth are indeed built upon that &s;ingle Circum&s;tance of the Removal of our fir&s;t Parents from <HI>Paradi&s;e;</HI> but though this is not in it &s;elf &s;o great a Subject as that in mo&s;t of the foregoing Books, it is extended and diver&s;ified with &s;o many &s;urprizing Incidents and plea&s;ing E|pi&s;odes, that the&s;e two la&s;t Books can by no means be looked upon as unequal Parts of this Divine Poem. I mu&s;t further add, that had not <HI>Milton</HI> re|pre&s;ented our fir&s;t Parents as driven out of <HI>Para|di&s;e,</HI> his Fall of Man would not have been com|pleat, and con&s;equently his Action would have been imperfect.</P>

<P><HI>MILTON,</HI> after having repre&s;ented in Vi&s;ion the Hi&s;tory of Mankind to the fir&s;t great Pe|riod of Nature, di&s;patches the remaining Part of it in Narration. He has devi&s;ed a very hand&s;ome Rea&s;on for the Angel's proceeding with <HI>Adam</HI> af|ter this manner; though doubtle&s;s the true Rea&s;on was the Difficulty which the Poet would have found to have &s;hadowed out &s;o mix'd and complicated a Story in vi&s;ible Objects. I could wi&s;h, however, that the Author had done it, whatever Pains it might have co&s;t him. To give my Opinion free|ly, I think that the exhibiting part of the Hi&s;tory of Mankind in Vi&s;ion, and part in Narrative, is as if an Hi&s;tory-Painter &s;hould put in Colours one half of his Subject, and write down the remaining part of it. If <HI>Milton</HI>'s Poem flags any where, it is in this Narration, where in &s;ome Places the Au|thor has been &s;o attentive to his Divinity, that he has neglected his Poetry. The Narration, howe|ver, ri&s;es very happily on &s;everal Occa&s;ions, where the Subject is capable of Poetical Ornaments, as particularly in the Confu&s;ion which he de&s;cribes among the Builders of <HI>Babel,</HI> and in his &s;hort Sketch of the Plagues of <HI>Aegypt.</HI> The Storm of Hail and Fire, with the Darkne&s;s that over&s;pread the Land for three Days, are de&s;cribed with great Strength. The beautiful Pa&s;&s;age which follows, is rai&s;ed upon noble Hints in Scripture. <Q><PB N="141" REF="140">
<L>&mdash;Thus with ten wounds</L>
<L>The River-Dragon tamed at length &s;ubmits</L>

<L>Pur&s;uing whom he late di&s;mi&s;s'd, the Sea</L>
<L>Swallows him with his ho&s;t, but them lets pa&s;s,</L>

<P>THE <HI>River-Dragon</HI> is an Allu&s;ion to the Croco|dile, which inhabits the <HI>Nile,</HI> from whence <HI>Aegypt</HI> derives her Plenty. This Allu&s;ion is taken from that &s;ublime Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Ezekiel; Thus &s;aith the Lord God, behold I am again&s;t thee</HI> Pharoah <HI>King of</HI> Egypt, <HI>the great Dragon that lieth in the mid&s;t of his Rivers, which hath &s;aid, My River is mine own, and I have made it for my &s;elf. Milton</HI> has given us another very noble and poetical Image in the &s;ame De&s;crip|tion, which is copied almo&s;t Word for Word out of the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> <Q><L>All night he will pur&s;ue, but his approach</L>

<P>AS the principal De&s;ign of this <HI>Epi&s;ode</HI> was to give <HI>Adam</HI> an Idea of the Holy Per&s;on, who was to re-in&s;tate Humane Nature in that Happine&s;s and Perfection from which it had fallen, the Poet con|fines him&s;elf to the Line of <HI>Abraham,</HI> from whence the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was to de&s;cend. The Angel is de&s;cri|bed
<PB N="142" REF="141">
as &s;eeing the Patriarch actually travelling to|wards the <HI>Land</HI> of <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> which gives a particular Liveline&s;s to this Part of the Narration. <Q><L>I &s;ee him, but thou can&s;t not, with what Faith</L>

<L>Gift to his progeny of all that Land,</L>
<L>From <HI>Hamath</HI> Northward to the de&s;ert South,</L>
<L>(Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed.)</L></Q></P>
<P>AS <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Vi&s;ion in the Sixth <HI>Aeneid</HI> probably gave <HI>Milton</HI> the Hint of this whole <HI>Epi&s;ode,</HI> the la&s;t Line is a Tran&s;lation of that Ver&s;e, where <HI>Anchi&s;es</HI> mentions the Names of Places, which they were to bear hereafter. <Q><L>Hac tum nomina erunt, nunc &s;unt &s;ine nomine terrae.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Poet has very finely repre&s;ented the Joy and Gladne&s;s of Heart which ri&s;es in <HI>Adam</HI> upon his Di&s;covery of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah.</HI> As he &s;ees his Day at a Di&s;tance through Types and Shadows, he re|joices in it; but when he finds the Redemption of Man compleated, and <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> again renewed, he breaks forth in Rapture and Tran&s;port, <Q><L>O goodne&s;s infinite, goodne&s;s immen&s;e!</L>
<L>That all this good of evil &s;hall produce, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>I have hinted in my Sixth Paper on <HI>Milton,</HI> that an Heroick Poem, according to the Opinion of the be&s;t Criticks, ought to end happily, and leave the Mind of the Reader, after having conducted it
<PB N="143" REF="142">
through many Doubts and Fears, Sorrows and Di&s;|quietudes, in a &s;tate of Tranquility and Satisfacti|on. <HI>Milton</HI>'s Fable, which had &s;o many other Qualifications to recommend it, was deficient in this Particular. It is here therefore, that the Poet has &s;hewn a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Judgment, as well as the fine&s;t Invention, by finding out a Method to &s;upply this natural Defect in his Subject. Accordingly he leaves the Adver&s;ary of Mankind, in the la&s;t View which he gives us of him, under the lowe&s;t State of Mortification and Di&s;appointment. We &s;ee him chewing A&s;hes, grovelling in the Du&s;t, and loaden with &s;upernumerary Pains and Torments. On the contrary, our two fir&s;t Parents are comforted by Dreams and Vi&s;ions, cheared with promi&s;es of Sal|vation, and, in a manner, rai&s;ed to a greater Hap|pine&s;s than that which they had forfeited: In &s;hort, <HI>Satan</HI> is repre&s;ented mi&s;erable in the Height of his Triumphs, and <HI>Adam</HI> triumphant in the Height of Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><HI>MILTON</HI>'s Poem ends very nobly. The la&s;t Speeches of <HI>Adam</HI> and the Arch-Angel are full of Moral and In&s;tructive Sentiments. The Sleep that fell upon <HI>Eve,</HI> and the Effects it had in quieting the Di&s;orders of her Mind, produces the &s;ame kind of Con&s;olation in the Reader, who cannot peru&s;e the la&s;t beautiful Speech which is a&s;cribed to the Mother of Mankind, without a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction. <Q><L>Whence thou return'&s;t, and whither went'&s;t, I know;</L>
<L>For God is al&s;o in Sleep; and Dreams advi&s;e,</L>
<L>Which he hath &s;ent propitious, &s;ome great good</L>
<L>Pre&s;aging, &s;ince with Sorrow and Heart's di&s;tre&s;s</L>
<L>Wearied I fell a&s;leep: but now lead on;</L>
<L>In me is no delay: with thee to go</L>
<L>Is to &s;tay here; without thee here to &s;tay</L>
<L>Is to go hence unwilling; thou to me</L>
<L><PB N="144" REF="143">
Art all things under Heav'n, all Places thou</L>
<L>Who for my wilful Crime are bani&s;h'd hence.</L>
<L>This farther Con&s;olation yet &s;ecure</L>
<L>I carry hence; though all by me is lo&s;t,</L>
<L>Such Favour, I unworthy, am vouch&s;af'd,</L>
<L>By me the promi&s;ed Seed &s;hall all re&s;tore.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE following Lines, which conclude the Po|em, ri&s;e in a mo&s;t glorious Blaze of Poetical Ima|ges and Expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>HELIODOR&V;S</HI> in his <HI>Aeshiopicks</HI> acquaints us, that the Motion of the Gods differs from that of Mortals, as the former do not &s;tir their Feet, nor proceed Step by Step, but &s;lide o'er the Surface of the Earth by an uniform Swimming of the whole Body. The Reader may ob&s;erve with how Poetical a De&s;cription <HI>Milton</HI> has attributed the &s;ame kind of Motion to the Angels who were to take Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of <HI>Paradi&s;e.</HI> <Q><L>So &s;pake our Mother <HI>Eve,</HI> and <HI>Adam</HI> heard</L>
<L>Well pleas'd, but an&s;wer'd not; for now too nigh</L>
<L>Th' Arch-Angel &s;tood, and from the other Hill</L>
<L>To their fix'd &s;tation, all in bright array</L>
<L>The Cherubim de&s;cended; on the Ground</L>
<L>Gliding meteorons, as ev'ning mi&s;t</L>
<L>Ris'n from a River, o'er the mari&s;h glides,</L>
<L>And gathers ground fa&s;t at the lab'rer's heel</L>
<L>Homeward returning. High in Front advanc'd</L>
<L>The brandi&s;h'd Sword of God before them blaz'd</L>
<L>Fierce as a Comet&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Author helped his Invention in the fol|lowing Pa&s;&s;age, by reflecting on the Behaviour of the Angel, who, in Holy Writ, has the Conduct of <HI>Lot</HI> and his Family. The Circum&s;tances drawn from that Relation are very gracefully made u&s;e of on this Occa&s;ion. <Q><PB N="145" REF="144">
<L>In either hand the ha&s;tning Angel caught</L>
<L>Our ling'ring Parents, and to the Ea&s;tern gate</L>
<L>Led them direct; and down the Cliff as fa&s;t</L>
<L>To the &s;ubjected plain; then di&s;appear'd.</L>
<L>They looking back, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>THE Scene which our fir&s;t Parents are &s;urprized with upon their looking back on <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> wonder|fully &s;trikes the Reader's Imagination, as nothing can be more natural than the Tears they &s;hed or that Occa&s;ion. <Q><L>They looking back, all th' Ea&s;tern &s;ide beheld</L>
<L>Of <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> &s;o late their happy Seat,</L>
<L>Wav'd over by the flaming brand, the gate</L>
<L>With dreadful faces throng'd and fiery Arms:</L>
<L>Some natural tears they dropp'd, but wiped them &s;oon.</L>
<L>The world was all before them, where to chu&s;e</L>
<L>Their place of re&s;t, and Providence their Guide.</L></Q></P>
<P>IF I might pre&s;ume to offer at the &s;malle&s;t Al|teration in this Divine Work, I &s;hould think the Poem would end better with the Pa&s;&s;age here quoted, than with the two Ver&s;es which follow. <Q><L>They hand in hand with wandering &s;teps and &s;low,</L>
<L>Through <HI>Eden</HI> took their &s;olitary way.</L></Q></P>
<P>THESE two Ver&s;es, though they have their Beauty, fall very much below the foregoing Pa&s;|&s;age, and renew in the Mind of the Reader that Angui&s;h which was pretty well laid by that Con&s;i|deration. <Q><L>The World was all before them, where to chu&s;e</L>
<L>Their place of re&s;t, and Providence their Guide.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE Number of Books in <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t</HI> is equal to tho&s;e of the <HI>Aeneid.</HI> Our Author in his Fir&s;t E|dition had divided his Poem into Ten Books, but afterwards broke the Seventh and the Eleventh
<PB N="146" REF="145">
each of them into two different Books, by the Help of &s;ome &s;mall Additions. This &s;econd Di|vi&s;ion was made with great Judgment, as any one may &s;ee who will be at the pains of examining it. It was not done for the &s;ake of &s;uch a Chimerical Beauty as that of re&s;embling <HI>Virgil</HI> in this Particu|lar, but for the more ju&s;t and regular Di&s;po&s;ition of this great Work.</P>
<P>THOSE who have read <HI>Bo&s;&s;u,</HI> and many of the Criticks who have written &s;ince his Time, will not pardon me if I do not find out the particular Mo|ral which is inculcated in <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</HI> Though I can by no means think, with the la&s;t-mentioned <HI>French</HI> Author, that an Epic Writer fir&s;t of all pitches upon a certain Moral, as the Ground-Work and Foundation of his Poem, and afterwards finds out a Story to it: I am, however, of Opinion, that no ju&s;t Heroic Poem ever was, or can be made, from whence one great Moral may not be deduced. That which reigns in <HI>Milton</HI> is the mo&s;t univer&s;al and mo&s;t u&s;eful that can be imagined; it is in &s;hort this, <HI>that Obedience to the Will of God makes Men happy, and that Di&s;obedience makes them mi&s;era|ble.</HI> This is vi&s;ibly the Moral of the principal Fa|ble which turns upon <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> who continu|ed in <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> while they kept the Command that was given them, and were driven out of it as &s;oon as they had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. This is likewi&s;e the Mo|ral of the principal Epi&s;ode, which &s;hews us how an innumerable Multitude of Angels fell from their State of Bli&s;s, and were ca&s;t into Hell upon their Di&s;obedience. Be&s;ides this great Moral, which may be looked upon as the Soul of the Fable, there are an Infinity of Under Morals which are to be drawn from the &s;everal Parts of the Poem, and which makes this Work more u&s;eful and in&s;tructive than any other Poem in any Language.</P>

THOSE who have Critici&s;ed on the <HI>Odi&s;&s;ey,</HI> the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and <HI>Aeneid,</HI> have taken a great deal of Pains to fix the Number of Months or Days contained in the Action of each of tho&s;e Poems. If any one thinks it worth his while to examine this Particu|lar in <HI>Milton,</HI> he will find that from <HI>Adam</HI>'s fir&s;t Appearance in the Fourth Book, to his Expul&s;ion from <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> in the Twelfth, the Author reckons ten Days. As for that Part of the Action which is de|&s;cribed in the three fir&s;t Books, as it does not pa&s;s within the Regions of Nature, I have before ob&s;er|ved that it is not &s;ubject to any Calculations of Time.</P>
<P>I have now fini&s;hed my Ob&s;ervations on a Work which does an Honour to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation. I have taken a general View of it under tho&s;e four Heads, the Fable, the Characters, the Sentiments, and the Language, and made each of them the Subject of a particular Paper. I have in the next place &s;poken of the Cen&s;ures which our Author may incur under each of the&s;e Heads, which I have con|fined to two Papers, though I might have enlarged the Number, if I had been di&s;po&s;ed to dwell on &s;o ungrateful a Subject. I believe, however, that the &s;evere&s;t Reader will not find any little Fault in He|roic Poetry, which this Author has fallen into, that does not come under one of tho&s;e Heads among which I have di&s;tributed his &s;everal Blemi&s;hes. Af|ter having thus treated at large of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> I could not think it &s;ufficient to have celebrated this Poem in the whole, without de&s;cending to Particu|lars. I have therefore be&s;towed a Paper upon each Book, and endeavoured not only to prove that the Poem is beautiful in general, but to point out its particular Beauties, and to determine wherein they con&s;i&s;t. I have endeavoured to &s;hew how &s;ome Pa&s;|&s;ages are beautiful by being Sublime; others by be|ing Soft; others by being Natural: which of them
<PB N="148" REF="147" MS="y">
are recommended by the Pa&s;&s;ion; which by the Mo|ral; which by the Sentiment, and which by the Ex|pre&s;&s;ion. I have likewi&s;e endeavoured to &s;hew how the Genius of the Poet &s;hines by a happy Invention; a di&s;tant Allu&s;ion; or a judicious Imitation: how he has copied or improved <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil,</HI> and rai&s;ed his own Imaginations by the U&s;e which he has made of &s;everal Poetical Pa&s;&s;ages in Scripture. I might have in&s;erted al&s;o &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of <HI>Ta&s;&s;o,</HI> which our Author has imitated; but as I do not look upon <HI>Ta&s;&s;o</HI> to be a &s;ufficient Voucher, I would not per|plex my Reader with &s;uch Quotations, as might do more Honour to the <HI>Italian</HI> than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poet. In &s;hort, I have endeavoured to particularize tho&s;e innumerable Kinds of Beauty, which it would be te|dious to recapitulate, but which are e&s;&s;ential to Po|etry, and which may be met with in the Works of this great Author. Had I thought, at my fir&s;t en|gaging in this De&s;ign, that it would have led me to &s;o great a Length, I believe I &s;hould never have entred upon it; but the kind Reception which it has met with among tho&s;e who&s;e Judgments I have a Value for, give me no Rea&s;on to repent of the pains I have been at in compo&s;ing them.</P>
