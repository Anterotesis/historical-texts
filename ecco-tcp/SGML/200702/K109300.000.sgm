<HEAD>TO HER GRACE the DUTCHESS OF <HI>ORMOND.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE Privilege of Poetry (or it may be the Vanity of the Pretenders to it) has given 'em a kind of Right to pretend, at the &s;ame time, to the Favour of tho&s;e, whom
<PB REF="4">
their high Birth and excellent Qua|lities have plac'd in a very di&s;tin|gui&s;hing manner above the re&s;t of the World. If this be not a receiv'd Maxim, yet I am &s;ure I am to wi&s;h it were, that I may have at lea&s;t &s;ome kind of Excu&s;e for laying this Tragedy at Your Grace's Feet. I have too much rea&s;on to fear that it may prove but an indifferent En|tertainment to Your Grace, &s;ince if I have any way &s;ucceeded in it, it has been in de&s;cribing tho&s;e violent Pa&s;&s;ions which have been always Strangers to &s;o happy a Temper, and &s;o noble and &s;o exalted a Virtue as Your Grace is Mi&s;tre&s;s of. Yet for all this, I cannot but confe&s;s the Va|nity which I have, to hope that there may be &s;omething &s;o moving in the Misfortunes and Di&s;tre&s;s of the Play, as may be not altogether unworthy of Your Grace's Pity. This is one of the main De&s;igns of Tragedy, and to
<PB REF="5">
excite this generous Pity in the great|e&s;t Minds, may pa&s;s for &s;ome kind of Succe&s;s in this way of Writing. I am &s;en&s;ible of the Pre&s;umption I am guilty of by this Hope, and how much it is that I pretend to in Your Grace's Approbation; if it be my good For|tune to meet with any little Share of it, I &s;hall always look upon it as much more to me than the general Applau&s;e of the Theatre, or even the Prai&s;e of a good Critick. Your Grace's Name is the be&s;t Protection this Play can hope for, &s;ince the World, ill-natur'd as it is, agrees in an univer&s;al Re&s;pect and Deference for Your Grace's Per&s;on and Cha|racter. In &s;o cen&s;orious an Age as this is, where Malice furni&s;hes out all the Publick Conver&s;ations, where every Body pulls and is pull'd to pieces of cour&s;e, and where there is hardly &s;uch a thing as being merry, but at another's Expence; yet by a
<PB REF="6">
publick and uncommon Ju&s;tice to the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Ormond,</HI> Her Name has never been mention'd, but as it ought, tho' She has Beauty enough to pro|voke Detraction from the Faire&s;t of Her own Sex, and Virtue e|nough to make the Loo&s;e and Di&s;&s;o|lute of the other (a very formidable Party) Her Enemies. In&s;tead of this they agree to &s;ay nothing of Her but what She de&s;erves, That Her Spirit is worthy of Her Birth; Her Sweet|ne&s;s, of the Love and Re&s;pect of all the World; Her Piety, of Her Reli|gion; Her Service, of Her Royal Mi|&s;tre&s;s; and Her Beauty and Truth, of Her Lord; that in &s;hort every part of Her Character is Ju&s;t, and that She is the be&s;t Reward for one of the great|e&s;t Hero's this Age has produc'd. This, Madam, is what You mu&s;t allow Peo|ple every where to &s;ay; tho&s;e whom You &s;hall leave behind You in <HI>Eng|land</HI> will have &s;omething further to
<PB REF="7">
add, the Lo&s;s we &s;hall &s;uffer by your Grace's Journey to <HI>Ireland;</HI> the Queen's Plea&s;ure, and the Impatient Wi&s;hes of that Nation are about to deprive us of Two of our Publick Ornaments. But there is no arguing again&s;t Rea&s;ons &s;o prevalent as the&s;e. Tho&s;e who &s;hall lament your Grace's Ab&s;ence will yet acquie&s;ce in the Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice of Her Maje&s;ty's Choice: Among all who&s;e Royal Favours none cou'd be &s;o agreeable, upon a thou&s;and Ac|counts, to that People, as the Duke of <HI>Ormond.</HI> With what Joy, what Ac|clamations &s;hall they meet a Govern|or, who be&s;ide their former Obligati|ons to His Family, has &s;o lately ven|tur'd His Life and Fortune for their Pre&s;ervation; What Duty, what Sub|mi&s;&s;ion &s;hall they not pay to that Au|thority which the Queen has delegated to a Per&s;on &s;o dear to 'em? And with what Honour, what Re&s;pect &s;hall they receive Your Grace, when they look
<PB REF="8">
upon You as the Noble&s;t and Be&s;t Pat|tern Her Maje&s;ty cou'd &s;end 'em, of her own Royal Goodne&s;s, and Per&s;o|nal Virtues? They &s;hall behold Your Grace with the &s;ame Plea&s;ure the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> &s;hall take when ever it &s;hall be their good Fortune to &s;ee You return again to Your Native Country. In <HI>Eng|land</HI> Your Grace is become a Publick Concern, and as Your going away will be attended with a general Sorrow, &s;o Your Return &s;hall give as general a Joy; and to none of tho&s;e many, more than to,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mr. <HI>Betterton.</HI></STAGE>
<LG>
<L>LONG has the Fate of Kings and Empires been</L>
<L>The common Busine&s;s of the Tragick Scene,</L>
<L>As if Misfortune made the Throne her Seat,</L>
<L>And none cou d be unhappy but the Great.</L>
<L>Dearly 'tis true each buys the Crown he wears,</L>
<L>And many are the mighty Monarch's Cares:</L>
<L>By foreign Foes and home-bred Factions pre&s;t,</L>
<L>Few are the Joys he knows and &s;hort his Hours of Re&s;t.</L>
<L>Stories like the&s;e with Wonder we may hear,</L>
<L>But far remote and in a higher Sphere,</L>
<L>We ne'er can pity what we ne'er can &s;hare.</L>
<L>Like di&s;tant Battles of the <HI>Pole</HI> and <HI>Swede,</HI></L>
<L>Which frugal Citizens o'er Coffee read,</L>
<L>Carele&s;s for who &s;hall fail or who &s;ucceed.</L>
<L>Therefore an humbler Theme our Author cho&s;e,</L>
<L>A melancholy Tale of private Woes:</L>
<L>No Princes here lo&s;t Royalty bemoan,</L>
<L>But you &s;hall meet with Sorrows like your own;</L>
<L>Here &s;ee imperious Love his Va&s;&s;als treat,</L>
<L>As hardly as Ambition does the Great;</L>
<L>See how &s;ucceeding Pa&s;&s;ions rage by turns,</L>
<L>How fierce the Youth with Joy and Rapture burns,</L>
<L>And how to Death for Beauty lo&s;t, he mourns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let no nice Ta&s;te the Poet's Art arraign,</L>
<L>If &s;ome frail vicious Characters he feign:</L>
<L>Who Writes &s;hou'd &s;till let Nature be his Care,</L>
<L>Mix Shades with Lights and not paint all things fair,</L>
<L>But &s;hew you Men and Women as they are.</L>
<L>With Deference to the Fair he bad me &s;ay,</L>
<L>Few to Perfection ever found the Way;</L>
<L>Many in many Parts are known t' excel,</L>
<L>But 'twere too hard for One to act all well;</L>
<L>Whom ju&s;tly Life &s;hould through each Scene commend,</L>
<L>The Maid, the Wife the Mi&s;tre&s;s, and the Friend:</L>
<L>This Age, 'tis true has one great In&s;tance &s;een,</L>
<L>And Heav'n in Ju&s;tice made that One a Queen.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. BRACEGIRDLE, who play'd <HI>Lavinia.</HI></STAGE>
<LG>
<L>YOU &s;ee the tripping Dame could find no Favour,</L>
<L>Dearly &s;he paid for Breach of good Behaviour,</L>
<L>Nor could her loving Husband's Fondne&s;s &s;ave her.</L>
<L><HI>Italian</HI> Ladies lead but &s;curvy Lives,</L>
<L>There's dreadful dealing with Eloping Wives;</L>
<L>Thus 'tis, becau&s;e the&s;e Husbands are obey'd</L>
<L>By force of Laws, which for them&s;elves they made,</L>
<L>With Tales of old Pre&s;criptions they confiae,</L>
<L>The Right of Marriage-rule to their Male Line,</L>
<L>And Hu&s;t, and Domineer by Right Divine,</L>
<L>Had we the Pow'r we'd make the Tyrants know,</L>
<L>What 'tis to fail in Duties which they owe;</L>
<L>We'd teach the &s;aunt'ring Squire, who loves to roam,</L>
<L>Forgetful of his own dear Spou&s;e and Home;</L>
<L>Who Snores at Night &s;upinely by her &s;ide,</L>
<L>'Twas not for this the Nuptial Knot was ty'd.</L>
<L>The plodding Petty-fogger, and the Cit,</L>
<L>Have learn'd at lea&s;t this Modern way of Wit:</L>
<L>Each ill-bred, &s;en&s;ele&s;s Rogue, tho' ne'er &s;o dull,</L>
<L>Has th' Impudence to think his Wife a Fool;</L>
<L>He &s;pends the Night, where merry Wags re&s;ort,</L>
<L>With joking Clubs, and Eighteen-penny Port,</L>
<L>While &s;he poor Soul's contented to regale,</L>
<L>By a &s;ad Sea-cole Fire, with Wigs and Ale.</L>
<L><PB REF="86">
Well may the Cuckold-making Tribe find Grace,</L>
<L>And fill an ab&s;ent Husband's empty place:</L>
<L>If you would e'er bring Con&s;tancy in Fa&s;hion,</L>
<L>You Men mu&s;t fir&s;t begin the Reformation.</L>
<L>Then &s;hall the Golden Age of Love return,</L>
<L>No Turtle for her wand'ring Mate &s;hall mourn,</L>
<L>No Foreign Charms &s;hall cau&s;e Dome&s;tick Strife,</L>
<L>But ev'ry marry'd Man &s;hall toa&s;t his Wife;</L>
<L><HI>Phillis</HI> &s;hall not be to the Country &s;ent,</L>
<L>For Carnivals in Town to keep a tedious <HI>Lent:</HI></L>
<L>Lampoons &s;hall cea&s;e, and envious Scandal die,</L>
<L>And all &s;hall live in Peace like my good Man and I.</L>
