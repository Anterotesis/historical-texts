<HEAD>What if the SWEDES &s;hould Come?</HEAD>
<P>_I Have been mighty willing to have had the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> been my Hero for &s;ome Years pa&s;t: His early Gallantry; the Injuries done him by his Enemies, which at fir&s;t drew him into the War, and many other Con&s;iderations, gave me warm Inclinations to his Intere&s;t. For 'tis natural to all hone&s;t Men to entertain fa|vourable Thoughts for Gallant Princes, howe|ver unfortunate.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Shock I receiv'd in my Opinion of his Conduct, was, when he lay &s;till &s;o many Months in <HI>Saxony</HI> with a great Army, refu&s;ed the Glory of healing the Breaches of <HI>Europe,</HI> which &s;eemed then all to be offer'd to his <HI>Ar|bitrium</HI>; and went upon a de&s;perate Enter|prize of dethroning the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>; a Prince who&s;e Strength con&s;i&s;ted at that Time rather in the Di&s;tance and Barrenne&s;s of his Countrey, than the Superiority of his Force.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="4">'Tis needle&s;s to enter into the Hi&s;tory of his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Affairs &s;ince then; which indeed have been but one continu'd Train of Misfortunes; yet even under the&s;e, the Vigor of his Courage has carry'd him on with &s;uch an unmov'd Steddine&s;s of Re&s;olution, that had not &s;ome of his Attempts &s;eem'd de&s;perately extravagant, it was hard not to have a &s;ecret Re&s;pect for &s;o much unfortunate Gallantry.</P>
<P>But if what we expect now from him &s;hould go on; if he &s;hould make this mo&s;t ridiculous Attempt, for &s;uch I mu&s;t call it, I &s;hall be|lieve him entirely <HI>demented</HI>; con&s;idering his own pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, dive&s;ted of all his <HI>German</HI> Dominions, de&s;titute of Allies, with|out Money, and at War with Five Potent Princes already, who are every Hour expected to Land in the Heart of his Dominions: If this Attempt &s;hould be made, I &s;hall have no more to &s;ay than this, What may not be ex|pected from a King that &s;leeps in his Boots, and lies in the Straw?</P>
<P>Having other Di&s;cour&s;es therefore before me, than a bare Enquiry by Gue&s;s, and a meer Search after the Conjectures of Men, Whe|ther the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> intends to come hi|ther or no? I &s;hall wave the in&s;ignificant De|bate, and take it for granted, according to the common Opinion, that we are really <HI>to expect him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">I mu&s;t make one Provi&s;ion however, as I go on, which the Iniquity of the Times makes nece&s;&s;ary, and which the Malice of Men al&s;o gives me Rea&s;on for; it being natural for &s;ome People to charge every Man that &s;peaks honou|rably of any Enemy, <HI>with being in his Party.</HI> I therefore premi&s;e, That by &s;aying <HI>I believe he will come,</HI> I do not imply that I de&s;ire he &s;hould. I neither wi&s;h it for his own Sake, or ours. I do not wi&s;h it <HI>for his own Sake</HI>; becau&s;e, as in a Quarrel with <HI>Great-Britain</HI> I cannot wi&s;h him Succe&s;s, &s;o in &s;ome other of his Quarrels, I know not how to wi&s;h him to be beaten. What In|fatuation has embark'd him in &s;o &s;candalous a Quarrel as this, again&s;t the King and Nation of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> God only knows: I fear it looks like a Judgment from Heaven upon him, for his entire Overthrow and De&s;truction.</P>
<P>Cea&s;ing then to pity him as a Brave and He|roick Prince, I mu&s;t, while his Eyes are turn'd this Way, look on him as an enrag'd Enemy, and I &s;peak of him as &s;uch.</P>
<P>It is no Work of mine to enter here upon the De&s;ign of his Coming; the Views upon which he has undertaken &s;uch a wild and unaccountable Attempt; or the Per&s;ons in who&s;e Cau&s;e he mu&s;t &s;eem to embark, <HI>if he makes the Attempt.</HI> I could &s;pend many Pages on the Improbability of Succe&s;s: The Strength of the Government here; the powerful Alli|ances the King is &s;upported with from Abroad;
<PB N="6" REF="6">
the Poverty and De&s;peration of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Circum&s;tances Abroad, <HI>and the like:</HI> But as all the&s;e are, <HI>if he comes,</HI> to be di&s;puted at the Muzzle of the Musket, and the Point of the Sword, talking of them in Paper will no way end the Di&s;pute, nor help our Troops.</P>
<P>I am therefore turning my Eyes another way, and looking upon our expecting People. Our Bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;ee if there be any Thing needful to be &s;aid to them. This Part of my Di&s;cour&s;e I &s;hall form, upon the Suppo&s;i|tion, <HI>whether it &s;hall be &s;o or no,</HI> That the <HI>Swedes</HI> were now actually on Shore here, to the Number of 20 or 25,000 Men, or any Number what they plea&s;e, as their Partizans here threaten they will be.</P>
<P>Some that know not the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and think <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> are a kind of People, that no body can look in the Face, talk <HI>Cavalierly</HI> of it all, and wi&s;h they were fairly on Shore, that a fair Battel might decide it.</P>
<P>For my Part I mu&s;t own, that tho' I cannot be &s;o Phlegmatic as &s;ome are, to be di&s;heartned and di&s;couraged at the very Thoughts of it, and if it was to be put to a Day of Battel &s;hould have a good Hope of Succe&s;s; yet nei|ther am I &s;o Sanguine, as to be fond of the Trial: Battel is a terrible Cri&s;is, be it how it will: And we have <HI>no certain Word,</HI> tho' we have <HI>a good Hope</HI> to direct us to know what
<PB N="7" REF="7">
the God of Battel may have determin'd about it. I mu&s;t therefore be of the Number of tho&s;e, who with a feeling Concern for the Mi|&s;eries of their Native Countrey, are ready to &s;ay, we would not be glad by any Means to hear that an Army of <HI>Swedes,</HI> or of any other Enemies, were actually on Shore here.</P>
<P>But while thus we are looking with an Eye of Expectance on the&s;e Events, and that with &s;ome Impatience; <HI>it &s;eems very nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> that with all the Calmne&s;s and Compo&s;ure I can, I &s;hould ca&s;t in my Mite towards allaying the general Anxiety which I &s;ee upon the Minds of Men, about this great Affair.</P>
<P>This I cannot do upon any Foundation &s;o well, as upon a Suppo&s;ition, that they will really land upon us if they can: And I think it is a very needful Que&s;tion to put to one ano|ther, as was by a certain Writer of tho&s;e Times, in Ca&s;e of the Pretender, <HI>What if they &s;hould Come?</HI></P>
<P>There is no doubt but many who have a feeling Sen&s;e of the Calamities of War, will &s;ay, <HI>What if he &s;hould Come</HI>! Why, 'tis plain, what will be the Ca&s;e. (1.) The Seat of a bloody War is fix'd in our own Countrey, which hitherto we have, ble&s;&s;ed be God, been deliver'd from; and have only paid our Quo|ta's, and &s;ent our Troops Abroad into other Countries, where the Fields have been ra|vaged, the People plundred, Virgins ravi&s;hed,
<PB N="8" REF="8">
Churches robb'd, old and young murder'd&punc; and the Fields cover'd with Blood. This wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> be then brought home to our own Doors; and we &s;hall feel the Mi&s;eries which we have only hitherto talk'd of at a Di&s;tance: As we have formerly pity'd the De&s;olations of <HI>Europe</HI>&punc; now they will all be at Liberty to pity us and we &s;hall be the <HI>Aceldama</HI> of the World. (2.) Another Thing will be, the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Par|ty will take Heart, Rebellion revive, and the Party of Men among us, who &s;o lately have been &s;uppre&s;s'd, will all fly to Arms again&punc; and the Intere&s;t of the Pretender will be &s;et on Foot, with a Foreign Power to &s;upport it&punc; the Con&s;equence of which may be bloody, and a terrible Civil War; and for how long, God only knows.</P>
<P>This is making it look as di&s;mal as we can well do; and I am willing to talk of it thus&punc; becau&s;e the Enemy &s;hould not be able to &s;ay&punc; I do not &s;ee it in a true Light.</P>
<P>Al&s;o I would not appear in&s;en&s;ible, becau&s;e I am not ignorant of the Calamities of a Coun+trey, which is made the Seat of a War, e&s;pe+cially of &s;o bloody, &s;o inveterate a War as thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> may be; and a War carry'd on with &s;o much Animo&s;ity, and perhaps Per&s;onal Rage, as this may be, if it comes to the length that the&s;e People per&s;uade them&s;elves it will. The De+&s;cription of a War between a Nation ju&s;tly alarm'd in its own Defence, and an enrag'd
<PB N="9" REF="9">
revengful Party, fir'd with the Reproaches of their late Defeat, and enrag'd to the la&s;t De|gree of Vengeance, if they have Power; and this Party now &s;upported by a Foreign Enemy; I &s;ay, the <HI>De&s;cription of &s;uch a War</HI> is not ea|&s;y, nor can the Calamities that may attend it be well de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>For, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To talk of it with Levity, and without Concern, would favour of the <HI>Ga&s;|cogne,</HI> and look like the Blu&s;ters of one that intended to have no Share in the Danger, and, perhaps, none in the Lo&s;s; &s;uch a Temper I care not to repre&s;ent: Or, <HI>Secondly,</HI> To talk of it with Anxiety and Concern, is to di&s;cou|rage People from that vigorous Re&s;olution to re&s;i&s;t <HI>to the Death,</HI> which is the undoubted Duty of every true Prote&s;tant, who has any Concern for the Intere&s;t, Safety, Liberty, and Deliverance of his Countrey.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore take the middle and ju&s;t Method; I &s;hall give due Weight to the In|vader, the Goodne&s;s of his Troops, the intre|pid Courage of their King, the De&s;peration of his Circum&s;tances, the Re&s;olution they come hither with, to Conquer, or to Dye: I am for allowing all the&s;e to be extraordinary, and Things that are not to be laughed at, or je&s;ted with; and I only de&s;ire that every Man that thinks them fit to be laugh'd at, may be ob|lig'd to be one of tho&s;e that &s;hall look them in the Face; and if he can laugh at them, he is welcome.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">I remember a Pa&s;&s;age of the late King <HI>James</HI> the IId, of which I was both Eye and Ear-Witne&s;s, and <HI>is as follows</HI>: When the King was expecting the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and pre|paring to put his Army in a Po&s;ture to receive him, he order'd Eight Regiments of his Light Hor&s;e to be made Curia&s;&s;iers, and to be arm'd with <HI>Back, Brea&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Head-Piece,</HI> as the <HI>Ger|man</HI> Curia&s;&s;iers are; and he appointed Three Regiments of them; (<HI>viz.</HI>) Of <HI>Lanier, Fen|wick,</HI> and a Third, who&s;e Colonel I do not remember, to pa&s;s in Review, with their Armour on, in St. <HI>George's Fields,</HI> where the King him&s;elf &s;aw them perform their Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>He drew them up round him, after he had review'd them, that they might hear him &s;peak; and told them, He was very well &s;ati&s;|fied with their Appearance, and did not doubt but they would behave them&s;elves well, when they came to Action; that it was his Concern for their Safety that had cau&s;ed him to order them to fight arm'd, and withal to give them a Superiority in the Field; and he added, <HI>I hope you will u&s;e your &s;elves to them, that they may not be tire&s;ome to you in Service; you will find the Advantage of them. Gentlemen,</HI> &s;aid the King, <HI>I a&s;&s;ure you the Troops we have to do with, will not be afraid to &s;how their Faces.</HI></P>
<P>He did not &s;ay this to di&s;courage but to ani|mate his Men; and with the &s;ame De&s;ign I hope we may be allow'd to &s;peak freely of the <HI>Swedes</HI>; that they are <HI>Iron-Fac'd Fellows,</HI> that
<PB N="11" REF="11">
will not turn their Backs for a Cut or two in their Fle&s;h; they are us'd to Blows, and know how to dye in the Service of their King: <HI>But what then?</HI> So much the greater will be the Glory of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Troops in Grappling with them. What are they, that we are not; and what have they, that we have not? Nay, how much greater are the Arguments our Men have to engage? They fight in Duty, and fol|low as they are led, for Glory, for Conque&s;t, and perhaps for Plunder; we for Liberty, Re|ligion, E&s;tates, Countries, Wives, and Chil|dren; and in a word, for all that can be dear to us as Men or as Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>But I wave this Part; 'tis fit for a Com|mander haranguing, <HI>as was the Cu&s;tom of old Times,</HI> at the Head of his Troops; a Trade as much out of Fa&s;hion <HI>now,</HI> as it was u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant <HI>then.</HI></P>
<P>My pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e is not directed to the Troops; I make no doubt but they will do their Duty; we have not &s;o many <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Cowards, as &s;ome People may imagine; but my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s is with the civil quiet Peo|ple at Home; who however they are <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>quiet,</HI> as I call them, becau&s;e of there being no Danger of their troubling us much with their <HI>fighting,</HI> yet are apt enough to bear their &s;hare in doing Mi&s;chief, and &s;ometimes may have it more in their Power, than &s;uch People &s;hould indeed be tru&s;ted with, to weaken or
<PB N="12" REF="12">
&s;trengthen the Hands of tho&s;e that do fight, than any that are in the Action it &s;elf.</P>
<P>And that I may tell tho&s;e People their Bu|&s;ine&s;s with Plainne&s;s, <HI>it is thus</HI> in &s;hort, If the Enemy Land, let us have a care that we be not the In&s;truments of our own Di&s;courage|ment; that we do not weaken our own Hands, and wound our own Helpers, by our Weakne&s;s and want of Conduct at Home: For this is cer|tain, That it is more in the Power of our own Folly, to do harm to our own Cau&s;e and In|tere&s;t, than we may imagine; and there are among us Men who may by their Ignorance do more Injury to the Cau&s;e of King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> while they even fit at Home, and &s;eem to do nothing, than the <HI>Swedes</HI> them&s;elves would do by the De&s;cent of an Army.</P>
<P>We &s;ee the&s;e People vaunting and &s;wagger|ing now of the Strength of the Nation, the Alliances of the King, the Weakne&s;s of the Enemy, and the Cowardline&s;s of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, and the like. Very well: Without en|quiring whether they are right or wrong; let them hold there where they are; but let me caution, that they be not, <HI>as is often the Ca&s;e with &s;uch People,</HI> as unrea&s;onably &s;urpriz'd and di&s;couraged afterwards, as they are now with|out Judgment in&s;ulting and defying. I remem|ber &s;ome of the High People in <HI>England,</HI> a little before the Revolution, who laugh'd at the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and made them the Subject of their Mirth and Sport, all
<PB N="13" REF="13">
the while they were talk'd of, and expected: No body could &s;hew any Concern about them at that Time, but the&s;e Men upbraided them with Cowardize, and a &s;neaking faint-hearted Folly. When the News came, that they were put out to Sea, but were driven back by a Storm, the Company of the&s;e People was really not <HI>bearable,</HI> (if that Word be &s;o) no, not among their own Friends: Nothing troubled them, but that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had not Landed, and been glo|riou&s;ly beaten, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards, when they were actually Land|ed, and Things began to look Threatning and Dangerous, the&s;e were the Men who grew melancholy, look'd di&s;mally; and in &s;hort, many of them run quite away, even before it came to a Cri&s;is, and never came back to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> for &s;ome Years afterwards.</P>
<P>There is a va&s;t deal of Odds between not contemning an Enemy, and not being afraid of him. It was a Maxim of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> Not to contemn his Enemies: And all the World knows he was never a Man of Fear. Let us give the <HI>Swedes</HI> their due Weight, that we may prepare to match them; and when they <HI>do come,</HI> as People tell us <HI>they will,</HI> let us take care not to be &s;urprized at it.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion is, <HI>What &s;hall we do if they Come?</HI> And the An&s;wer is as direct as the Que&s;tion; <HI>Do! We mu&s;t Fight them.</HI> There is nothing el&s;e to be done with them, nor is there any need to fear but we &s;hall be well
<PB N="14" REF="14">
able to do this. They mu&s;t be Fought with; and that immediately; <HI>before</HI> they have Time to re&s;t and refre&s;h them&s;elves; <HI>before</HI> they have Time to extend and &s;pread them&s;elves, and open the Country, to make way for Re|bels, Di&s;affected and <HI>Jacobite</HI> Rabbles to join with them, and li&s;t in their Troops: <HI>Before</HI> they can increa&s;e their own Numbers, get a Footing in the Country, or give Time for others to draw together and divert the King's Army. <HI>This mu&s;t be done</HI> with Vigor, and immediate Application; and it's our Duty that are not in the Field, and are not immediately call'd out to Action, to Encourage and Enliven tho&s;e that are, by the Chearfulne&s;s of our Countenances, and the Readine&s;s of our ap|pearing on all Occa&s;ions, to Support, Supply, Recruit and A&s;&s;i&s;t the King, his Government and Family, with our Sub&s;tance, and with whatever nece&s;&s;ary Sums may be wanting on &s;uch an Emergency as this. To this Purpo&s;e, one great part of our Duty, who are in the Intere&s;t of King <HI>GEORGE, is this,</HI> and it is on this Account the&s;e Sheets are written, (<HI>viz.</HI>) not to di&s;courage one another.</P>
<P>And that I may &s;peak plainly to the People that are more particularly concerned, and tell you directly what I mean by di&s;couraging one another; I mean, that cur&s;ed, fooli&s;h, and if I may &s;o call it, fatal Way we have, of running down all Publick Credit, and Publick Funds and Stocks, upon the Surprize of &s;uch Things
<PB N="15" REF="15">
as the&s;e, as if we were Confederate with the Enemy in the Attempt upon our Country.</P>
<P>I know nothing within my Ob&s;ervation, more ab&s;urd and ridiculous than this Practice; and yet I &s;ee no Di&s;ea&s;e among us harder to cure; and the more, becau&s;e it is not always the meer Contrivance or Practice of the Enemies to the Government; for if that were the Ca&s;e, &s;ome Mea&s;ures ought to be taken, and might be taken to prevent it: But the very Friends to the Publick are found to be the Men &s;oone&s;t frighted, and in their Fright doing mo&s;t Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>If a High-Church-Man gets up <HI>Bank</HI> Bills, and hurries them in for Payment, mu&s;ters up all his Party, and Friends; to run down Stocks, and to &s;ink Publick Credit, we know his De|&s;ign, and the End of it: But for the other People to take the Alarm, and to &s;ee them blindly follow, though their Enemies lead, is prepo&s;terous, and unan&s;werably weak.</P>
<P>To what Purpo&s;e al&s;o is it, that the Whigs do this? And who are the Lo&s;ers, when they run to <HI>Exchange-Alley</HI> with their Stocks, Funds, Annuities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;ell them in a Fright? Who do they Enrich, and who are they that make a Prize of their Fears? Are they not their Enemies the High Men, who generally buy them up at the fallen Rate, to which the Sellers own Fears have reduc'd them, and then in a few Days fell them back again to the poor De&s;ponding Creatures, when
<PB N="16" REF="16">
their Courage is a little reviv'd and their Spi|rits recover'd, at perhaps Ten <HI>per Cent</HI> again?</P>
<P>Exactly thus was the Ca&s;e at the late At|tempt for an Inva&s;ion in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> in Queen <HI>ANNE</HI>'s Time, of which I &s;hall &s;peak more largely by and by. In the mean Time, in order to prevent this Mi&s;chief on the like Surprize, I would only recommend to tho&s;e who are Friends to King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Intere&s;t, this one Con&s;idera|tion, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That this is the ONE, and only Thing, by which you can effectually Ruin your Country, and betray King <HI>GEORGE</HI> into the Hands of his and your Enemies. 'Tis pity indeed, that the true Intere&s;t of the Nation &s;hould be &s;o much at the Mercy of Mens Fears, and that a Set of People, who have &s;uch a &s;incere Affection to the King and his Intere&s;t, as that there is no room to &s;u&s;pect them of an ill De|&s;ign, &s;hould be able to do &s;o much Prejudice to the Cau&s;e they are embark'd in, and be &s;o un|able to avoid it. So ju&s;t a Remark is it, that Men in Danger, who let Fear govern them, run into their Danger, rather than out of it: Fear deprives Men of the U&s;e of tho&s;e Helps which Rea&s;on offers; and Men in a Fright ge|nerally do them&s;elves Harm, by the Mea&s;ures they take to do them&s;elves Good.</P>
<P>Let me turn this Advice to the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> in Particular. O Ancient and Famous Metropolis, the Mart of <HI>Europe,</HI> and Ma|gazine of the whole World; as Immen&s;e in
<PB N="17" REF="17">
Wealth, as Innumerable in People, Sumptuous in Buildings, Rich, even to Profu&s;ion, in Fur|niture and Equipage, Formidable in Wealth, and ju&s;tly e&s;teemed beyond all the Cities in the World, for Shipping, Commerce, Inhabi|tants and Credit.</P>
<P>Of you it has been a happy Truth, which has &s;o &s;eldom been contradicted, that it al|mo&s;t became Proverbial, That in all the Civil Broils of the Kingdom, that Side which the City of <HI>London</HI> adher'd to, always prevail'd. And whence has this proceeded, but from the hearty, generous, and bold Advances your Citizens made, as well in rai&s;ing Men, fur|ni&s;hing Armies and Navies with Provi&s;ions, Arms, Nece&s;&s;aries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the War, as par|ticularly &s;upporting by your Credit and Ca&s;h, the Party you e&s;pou&s;ed, in a Manner and with a Zeal peculiar to your immen&s;e Riches, and inimitable by any other part of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>In the Times of the late Confu&s;ions in the Reign of King <HI>Charles,</HI> the Courage and Una|nimity of your City in concurring with the Parliament, gave them &s;uch eminent Advan|tages, as well in levying Armies, fitting Fleets, as &s;upplying tho&s;e Armies and Fleets, and their Leaders, with great Sums of Money on all Emergencies, as was the chief, if not at &s;ome times the only Support of that War, and in the End gave to the &s;aid Parliament that ma|nife&s;t

Superiority over the King's Party, as finally ended in the Overthrow of all his Ma|je&s;ty's Mea&s;ures, and made the Parliament, to whom you &s;o con&s;tantly adhered, invincible.</P>
<P>Your Money re&s;tor'd their Circum&s;tances, your Numbers recruited their Troops, your Steadine&s;s and con&s;tant Adherence to them, made them, <HI>Antaeus</HI>-like, ri&s;e up from every Fall, &s;tronger than they were before.</P>
<P>It cannot now be &s;aid that your Affection to King <HI>GEORGE</HI> and his Intere&s;t, is le&s;s than that of your Forefathers was for the Par|liament Side in a Civil War; your Wealth, Opulence, Commerce, Manufactures, and e&s;pecially your Numbers, are vi&s;ibly and re|markably greater than ever.</P>
<P>With you are found tho&s;e immen&s;e Sums of Money which are no where el&s;e in the World &s;o much as heard of; they are your Citizens, who when Two or Three Millions <HI>Sterling</HI> are wanted to any inviting Propo&s;al, frequently fill up the Sub&s;criptions in Two or Three Hours, and are ready to tread one another to Death to bring in their Money.</P>
<P>You give the Standard to our Wealth; and it is the Glut of Money within your Walls, that gives Rea&s;on to the Parliament to reduce the Intere&s;t of Money through the whole Na|tion: Your Banks are the Center of the running Ca&s;h, as the Stocks of your Companies are the Fund of Credit and Commerce: Money flows
<PB N="19" REF="21">
Annually from the&s;e, as from a Fountain, dif|fu&s;ing it &s;elf like the Blood through the Veins, not of your City alone, but of the whole King|dom.</P>
<P>Your growing Wealth, and the Ri&s;e of Fa|milies within your Walls, exceeds the Imagi|nation, much more the De&s;cription, of the nice&s;t Calculators. The Nobility, and the Gentry of <HI>Britain,</HI> by well managing Hereditary E&s;tates, improving their Revenues, intermarrying with flowing Fortunes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> maintain the Lu&s;tre of Antient Families, and &s;ometimes grow up to great Magnitude upon the Ruins and Decay of one another. But in you the greate&s;t Fortunes are rai&s;ed by Indu&s;try and Application, from the &s;malle&s;t Beginnings; nay, from meer Air, and in a word, from nothing at all; &s;hewing, that <HI>an E&s;tate indeed is a Pond,</HI> but Trade is a Spring; the one may contain its own Waters within its firm and faithful Banks, but the other is an inexhau&s;tible Flux of Wealth, that knows no Decrea&s;e, but overflows its Banks, and enriches continually its adjacent Parts with its plentiful Streams.</P>
<P>Hence the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Families of the Nobility think it now not below them, to &s;earch the opulent Families of the <HI>London</HI> Merchants, to find immen&s;e Fortunes for their Elde&s;t Sons, by who&s;e Trea&s;ures the Mortgag'd E&s;tates of their Ance&s;tors are redeem'd, and the Daughters of our Citizens never fail to be|come
<PB N="20" REF="22">
a Coronet at the Coronations of our Queens.</P>
<P>But why do we talk of the&s;e Things? 'Tis to Thee, our Princes apply for weighty Loans, upon the Emergencies of State; nor can the Demands of the Nation be &s;o great, but thou art able to &s;upply them at the &s;horte&s;t Warning. 'Tis thy Credit adds Currency to the Royal <HI>Exchequer,</HI> who&s;e Bills are brought to thy <HI>Bank</HI> to give them Life, and which vi&s;ibly &s;tagnated in their own Worth, notwith|&s;tanding their high Intere&s;t, till they receiv'd a new Circulation at thy Hands.</P>
<P>Even the Imperial <HI>Exchequer</HI> flies to thy un|fathomable Wealth for its Supply, and Mort|gages Nations to Thee for thy Money: Nay is not the whole Nation Mortgaged to thee at this Time; and of Fifty Millions <HI>Sterling</HI> which the Government is now in Debt, and for which the whole I&s;land is Burthened with Taxes to di&s;charge; is not the Gro&s;s of the Money thine, and is not the Value of the Intere&s;ts and Properties governed at thy Plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>Where &s;hall we go to match the Wealth of thy Inhabitants; and what City or Nation is there in the World, that we can de&s;cribe thee by?</P>
<P>Let us bring back all this to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. While this City &s;tands, while this Wealth circulates, while this Credit &s;upports it &s;elf,
<PB N="21" REF="23">
and the Spirit and Courage of the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> hold up, no Inva&s;ion, no de&s;perate At|tempt of Foreign Kings, or Dome&s;tick Rebels can affect us.</P>
<P>What Madne&s;s then mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the Minds of the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> that in Ca&s;e of any Publick Dangers, or the View of Publick Di&s;|orders, &s;hall, in&s;tead of bold Declarations to &s;tand by their Sovereign, and to &s;upport one another to the la&s;t, fall immediately to &s;tab|bing and wounding the Vitals of their own Credit, running every one to the <HI>Baenk</HI> for their Money, to the Markets with their Stocks, as if all was lo&s;t, and they were every one to &s;hift for them&s;elves? Like Sailors in a Ship, who while the Ship &s;wims, and the Ma&s;ts &s;tand, a&s;&s;i&s;t one another, and look well to the Main; but when &s;he &s;trikes upon a Rock, and is vi&s;i|bly &s;plitting, then every Man prepares to &s;wim, and &s;ave his own Life. But to carry this Si|mile home; if Men frighted with their own Shadows, abandon the Conduct of the Ship while &s;he is &s;ound, and has &s;uffer'd no Da|mage, they ruin them&s;elves, and are the only Cau&s;e of the Lo&s;s of the Ship.</P>
<P>What can be the Condition of the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> that they &s;hould &s;uffer them&s;elves to be terrify'd and di&s;order'd, at the Shadow of Enemies while they are yet at a Di&s;tance? And why &s;hould they take this fatal Way of expre&s;&s;ing their Apprehen&s;ions, which not on|ly
<PB N="22" REF="24">
weakens their own Hands, but gives inex|pre&s;&s;ible Room of Boa&s;ting and Triumph to their Enemies; not making only, but in|crea&s;ing the Terror and vain Apprehen&s;ions; and be&s;ides all, making their Market.</P>
<P>What an Example had we of this Practice at the Attempt of the Pretender, in the late Queen's Time, to land in <HI>Scotland</HI>? It was then but too evident, that had the Pretender landed, tho' at that Time the Di&s;affection was not reckon'd &s;o dangerous as it has been &s;ince, yet the very Stop of the <HI>Bank,</HI> the Run upon Stocks, and the Ruin of the Publick Credit, were &s;uch, as in Two or Three Days, had it continu'd, would have put all the Nation into an inexpre&s;&s;ible Confu&s;ion. It is true, it was begun by the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, who were Ene|mies; but the timerous Party of the Whigs, who were Friends to the Government, took the Fright, and like Men in a Ship, who be|gin to &s;trip that they may &s;wim, put the re&s;t immediately into the &s;ame Confu&s;ion too. It was then all the Stocks and Funds &s;unk in Va|lue; the Run upon the <HI>Bank</HI> was &s;uch, that had the Pretender landed, tho' he had been beaten afterwards, yet it is certain, the <HI>Bank</HI> mu&s;t have &s;topp'd Payment, and every Thing was running into Di&s;traction.</P>
<P>This is the Folly I would arm the Citizens again&s;t, as the only Injury they can do them|&s;elves, and as the great Di&s;couragement to the
<PB N="23" REF="25">
whole Nation. If the <HI>Swedes</HI> &s;hould land, the <HI>Jacobites</HI> arm, the Troops draw together to fight; is that a Time to &s;hew our &s;elves un|ea&s;y, to fly to the Publick Funds and Places of Receipt, to take in our Money? What is that le&s;s or more, than to &s;ay we look upon all as lo&s;t, and are willing to &s;hift for our &s;elves?</P>
<P>And how &s;candalous is this to a City of that Magnitude, Wealth, and Grandeur, not to &s;ay Pride, as the City of <HI>London</HI>? Did our Fa|thers do this, when the Royal Army was marching up victorious from <HI>Oxford,</HI> after &s;ome Advantage in the Field, and very few to op|po&s;e them; and the King, at the Head of his Army, was come up to <HI>Brentford</HI>; when as it was &s;aid, &s;ome even of the Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons were &s;ecretly fled, and the Cau&s;e was upon the Point of being given up? What did the City? They rai&s;ed new Troops, &s;ent out their Regiments of Auxiliaries, march'd out in Per&s;on, and encourag'd the Troops &s;o much by their Example, that the King's Ar|my receiv'd a Check at <HI>Brentford,</HI> and dur&s;t make no further Attempt.</P>
<P>Did the City behave then in a Cau&s;e &s;o di&s;pu|table, and at be&s;t &s;o inferior to this now be|fore us; and &s;hall we be all in an Alarm, and run down our publick Credit and publick Stocks, and ama&s;s our Money into our own Hands, as if we were packing up our All to be gone? For &s;hame, O ye Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> who va|lue
<PB N="24" REF="26">
you &s;elves upon your Sen&s;e of the <HI>Revo|lution,</HI> exemplify'd in King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;ion, be not thus the De&s;troyers of your &s;elves.</P>
<P>How &s;candalous is it, that your Stocks &s;hould fall, and your Credit &s;eem to decline already, even upon the Notion of this remote Inva&s;ion; a Thing which may be, or may not be; and which it is Two to One now whether it be not already defeated and di&s;appointed? What can the meaning of this be? Why is your Credit in the City wor&s;e if the King of <HI>Swe|den</HI> were actually on Shore, than it is now? Is there any Doubt but he mu&s;t be beaten? Is it po&s;&s;ible we can be &s;o di&s;pirited, as to fear King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s being dethron'd; and if there is no Danger of that, Why are our Pub|lick Funds le&s;s worth? And if that &s;hould be, What are you and all your Funds good for? So that on the whole, your only Step is to keep up the Credit, keep up your E&s;teem of all publick Matters; for by that you keep up the Value of your own E&s;tates, keep up the Courages of all your Friends, and do more to di&s;appoint and di&s;courage your Enemies, than Ten Thou&s;and Men extraordinary could do in the Field.</P>
<P>For it's plain, one great Expectation of the Tories, in the Beginning of their Succe&s;s, is, That we &s;hall be all in an Amaze, that Stocks will run down, the <HI>Bank</HI> &s;top Payment, and
<PB N="25" REF="27">
the Citizens &s;hew them&s;elves in a Fright, than which nothing can be a greater Mark of a ge|neral Confu&s;ion and Di&s;couragement.</P>
<P>While I am talking thus to the Citizens who know the&s;e Things, I need &s;ay no more to &s;hew them the Folly of this unhappy Conduct; they know very well how many ill Con&s;equen|ces it is attended with, and how many Ways it is &s;erviceable to the Enemy.</P>
<P>But perhaps &s;ome may an&s;wer, We acknow|ledge the Fact, but which way is it po&s;&s;ible to prevent it? Every one have their own Fears, aand their own Apprehen&s;ions; and Thou&s;ands are in Circum&s;tances which render them more &s;ubject than ordinary to &s;uch Apprehen&s;ions, having little or nothing el&s;e to depend upon, but what are in &s;uch publick Hands; and be|ing afraid to have the Rate of Things fall far|ther, they therefore &s;ell off, and ha&s;ten the Fall farther by increa&s;ing the Fright.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things may be true in &s;ome Particu|lars, but cannot hold good in the general; and there may be many u&s;eful Things offered to the Per&s;ons concerned, to prevent &s;uch a Con|fu&s;ion, as is the u&s;ual Con&s;equence in the&s;e Ca&s;es; and had &s;uch Mea&s;ures been taken in former Times, the little malicious Runs upon Stocks and Banks had not happened.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t Appearance of any &s;uch Di&s;|order, all that are Friends to the pre&s;ent Go|vernment, that value the Credit of the City,
<PB N="26" REF="28">
and &s;ee the U&s;efulne&s;s of keeping up the Courage of the People to the common Inte|re&s;t, will, if they have any Regard to that Intere&s;t, &s;tand together with their Fortunes and Stock of Ca&s;h, and &s;upport the Credit of the <HI>Bank.</HI> And to encourage them in this Work, the Names of all &s;uch Citizens, who having Money in the <HI>Bank,</HI> forbear to call it out, or who carry any Money in to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Bank,</HI> at &s;uch a Time of Exigence, &s;hould be taken down, in order to be laid be|fore the Parliament, and in order to have them publickly known, that the Government may on all Occa&s;ions make &s;uch Acknowledgment to them, and reward them in &s;uch a Manner as &s;o generous a Conduct &s;hall de&s;erve.</P>
<P>That on the contrary, the Names of all tho&s;e Bankers, Merchants, or whatever other Per&s;ons, that &s;hall be found making large De|mands on the <HI>Bank</HI> at &s;uch a Time as that, &s;hould be taken down, and laid al&s;o before the Parliament, that they might be known, mark'd out, and due Notice taken of them, as there &s;hould be Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>At &s;uch a Time as this, it would &s;eem an ac|ceptable Service, for the Citizens, on &s;uch Oc|ca&s;ions as may offer, to &s;ub&s;cribe large Ad|vances of Money upon &s;uch publick Securities as the Parliament may offer; that it may be &s;een the City are neither doubtful or di&s;cou|raged
<PB N="27" REF="29">
in Defence of King <HI>GEORGE</HI> and his Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e are Steps fitter and more becoming the Zealous and Loyal City of <HI>London,</HI> than the Confu&s;ions occa&s;ion'd by running down their own Credit, and le&s;&s;ening the Value of their own E&s;tates, as if all was in a Fright, and the Nation in Danger of being lo&s;t. And I am free to &s;ay, &s;uch a Step as this would go farther to the conquering of the King of <HI>Swe|den,</HI> and di&s;couraging the <HI>Jacobites</HI> from join|ing them, or from appearing together in order to encourage and &s;upport the <HI>Swedes,</HI> than the rai&s;ing Ten Thou&s;and Men to join the Army would do.</P>
<P>I could propo&s;e many noble Things &s;uch a City as this could do, upon &s;o eminent an Oc|ca&s;ion as this. But I know none that can come up to this. Let the <HI>Jacobites</HI> &s;ee the <HI>Bank</HI> &s;upported by the Money'd-Men, &s;ee the Stocks ri&s;e 2 <HI>per Cent.</HI> the very Day they hear of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Coming, and the City advancing Two Millions to the Govern|ment upon new Funds, and then let us but ob&s;erve their Countenances: Such a Step would as effectually di&s;hearten and di&s;appoint them, as beating the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Fleet before they landed would do: I take upon me to &s;ay, that in ca&s;e &s;uch a Thing as a <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Inva&s;i|on is projected, and a Rebellion at the End of it, the Dependance of the Enemy is as much
<PB N="28" REF="30">
upon the Confu&s;ions and Di&s;orders &s;uch Things u&s;ually make among the People in <HI>London,</HI> by the Stop of Credit, the Fall of Stocks, and the like, as upon beating the Forces, nay, and more too; for this is the Thing by which they expect to di&s;courage the Friends of the Government, and hearten and en|courage their own Party to take Arms. And indeed what can rai&s;e Tumults and Di&s;orders &s;ooner than a Stagnation of Credit, a Stop of Ca&s;h, an Interruption of Trade, and a gene|ral Face of Fright and Terror upon the King's Friends?</P>
<P>Is this the Way to beat the <HI>Swedes</HI>? Or is it the Way to cau&s;e a de&s;picable Enemy to ruin us, while they them&s;elves are out of Gun-Shot? Is it po&s;&s;ible that our Enemies, through the Infirmity of our Friends, &s;hould have found out a new-invented Engine to wound a whole Nation at a Blow, that kills while the Per&s;on hurting is entirely out of Sight, and out of Reach, and cannot have the Wound return'd? Is not this to make them fancy to them&s;elves, that Heaven is fighting for them, as it did once for King <HI>Jeho&s;aphat</HI>&punc; and that we are as the Children of <HI>Ammon</HI> and Mount <HI>Seir,</HI> who are killing one another for fear, without any Rea&s;on, but by an Infatua|tion from Heaven?</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31">Certainly it is an Infatuation; that there is no Room to di&s;pute. Whether it be from Heaven or not, Let the Ca&s;ui&s;ts and Divines an&s;wer that.

Can any Rational Account be gi|ven for it? O Citizens! O <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI>! re|member a little your own Circum&s;tances; no|thing but a little Steadine&s;s under all the&s;e Things is wanting, to make you the mo&s;t for|midable People in the World; while this foo|li&s;h Temper makes you a Terror to your &s;elves, and the Scorn and Laughing-Stock of your Enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">I have been told by tho&s;e who &s;ay they know it very well, that when the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> were in that terrible Fright at about Twenty Two Sail of Ships, though Twenty Eight were at the Heels of them; and Seven Thou&s;and Men, though the whole Nation was ready to Arm again&s;t them; I &s;ay, I have been told, that when they &s;old their Stocks at 14 <HI>per Cent</HI> le&s;s than they co&s;t them, and had the <HI>Pretender</HI> Landed, would have &s;old them for any Thing they could get; it was the Tory Party that bought them: And that in le&s;s than a Fortnight, their Fright being over, they bought them back again from the Tories, for the old Price again: So that as was &s;aid, the Tories got Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds by the needle&s;s Fright the Whigs were in; and all this in le&s;s than Twenty Days Time, and laugh'd at them into the Bargain: Was there any Thing but Madne&s;s and Infatuation in all this?</P>
<P>If you would not be thus dup'd, and let into the Secret again; if you have any Re|gard to the Cau&s;e you are embark'd in, and to King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> who is ready to &s;tand by you, and merits that you &s;hould better &s;tand by Him, than by &s;uch Conduct as this, you can be &s;uppos'd to do: <HI>Be wi&s;er,</HI> &s;hew more Steddine&s;s, more Re&s;olution, more Sen&s;e of the Nature and Con&s;equence of the Things be|fore you: In &s;hort, remember your Vows to

King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> your Engagements to &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;t him: Is this a&s;&s;i&s;ting him? Or is it a&s;&s;i&s;ting his Enemies? Cowardice is Trea&s;on in its Nature, though not in its De|&s;ign; and a Coward is as ill u&s;ed in an Army, as a Traytor, though not for the &s;ame Rea&s;on. And what is this but Cowardice, and that of the wor&s;t Kind, for it is a Pannick that &s;eizes you, while your Enemy is afar off; and that of &s;o fatal a Nature, that it does as it were open the Door to him, and invite him to come in; nay, which is wor&s;e, it encourages Tray|tors at Home to open the Door, and a&s;&s;i&s;t to let them in.</P>
<P>It makes the Enemy appear as if they were more formidable than really they are, and gives them a Triumph, even without a Victory. Do you think they do not &s;tand and laugh on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, to &s;ee the Citizens crowd down <HI>Grocers-Alley</HI> to the <HI>Bank,</HI> and come back hug|ging their Money, as if they had ju&s;t &s;natch'd it out of the Fire, or &s;av'd it from a Shipwreck? Is this like the Citizens of <HI>Carthage,</HI> where the Ladies cut off their Hair, which was then the greate&s;t Ornament of Beauty, and willingly gave it to make Cordage and Ropes for the Rigging out their Navy again&s;t the <HI>Romans?</HI> Or is it rather like the Citizens of <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> who pleaded Poverty with their Em|peror, when he begg'd of them from Door to Door, to contribute Money to hire Troops

<P>What do all our Addre&s;&s;es and A&s;&s;ociations amount to, if in a Time of Difficulty you aban|don your &s;elves to needle&s;s Fears, and &s;uffer Rumours and Shams rai&s;ed by your Enemies, to make an Impre&s;&s;ion upon you in this mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Part?</P>
<P>And now I have mention'd <HI>A&s;&s;ociations,</HI> Things which I confe&s;s I have not &s;een &s;o much Benefit ari&s;e from as has been expected; <HI>I do not mean now only,</HI> but even formerly too: I &s;ay, &s;ince I have named the Word ASSO|CIATION, I cannot but put my Fellow Citizens in mind of it, how they may <HI>A&s;&s;ociate</HI> NOW more to their own Honour, and to the Intere&s;t of the King, and the whole Nation, <HI>than ever</HI> they, or perhaps any City in the World, had an Opportunity to do before.

<PB N="33" REF="35">
as they ought to do, I affirm it is in their Power to form &s;uch an <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> at this Time, or at any Time of publick Danger, as would fright the mo&s;t Potent Enemy in <HI>Eu|rope</HI> from ever making any Attempt to di&s;turb the Peace of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>This would be, by a general A&s;&s;ociation of the Money'd Men, to &s;tand together, and a&s;|&s;i&s;t one another with their utmo&s;t Strength of Money and Credit, to &s;upport the Credit of the Publick Stocks, to maintain the Currency and Honour of the <HI>Bank,</HI> and to prevent any Po&s;|&s;ibility of the Enemy making a Run, or Pu&s;h, as they call it, upon the <HI>Bank,</HI> to the Stop of their Ca&s;h, or hindring the Circulation of their current Bills.</P>
<P>In virtue of this A&s;&s;ociation, the Sub&s;cribers &s;hould agree, and oblige them&s;elves not to draw any Money out, or transfer any of their Stock from the <HI>Bank</HI> at an Under or Falling Price, for &s;uch and &s;uch a Time, or during any &s;uch Time of Publick Apprehen&s;ions of Danger.</P>
<P>They &s;hould on the other Hand, rai&s;e a Ca|pital Sub&s;cription of Seven, Eight, or Ten Millions <HI>Sterling,</HI> to &s;upport the &s;aid Credit of the <HI>Bank,</HI> as well by buying up all the Stock of &s;uch, as through Malice, or real Ignorance and Apprehen&s;ions, &s;hall offer to &s;ell the &s;ame at any Price, not exceeding Five <HI>per Cent.</HI> un|der the current Price of the <HI>Bank</HI> Stock, as it

<P>Time, and the narrow Extent of this &s;mall Tract, will not permit me to enter into an En|quiry what a Glory &s;uch a Tran&s;action as this would bring; not to the Reign of King <HI>GEORGE</HI> only, but to the Memory of &s;uch Subjects, and &s;uch a City, through the whole World.

<P>'Tis from a true and di&s;tingui&s;h'd Zeal for the Pro&s;perity and Glory of the City of <HI>London,</HI> the Safety of the King's Government, and the Peace of the whole Nation, that the Author of the&s;e Sheets has made the&s;e Thoughts Publick; and as he never entertain'd a Thought, or wi&s;h'd in Prejudice of the Prote|&s;tant

<P>Such a Method as this would &s;o &s;trengthen the Hands of King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> &s;o en|courage His Friends and faithful Subjects, &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h His Intere&s;t, and &s;ecure His Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that we &s;hould for the future have on one Side le&s;s Occa&s;ion, and on the other le&s;s Anxiety about the keeping, or not keeping, Standing Forces on Foot, on the&s;e or any other Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>And now I have mention'd that &s;o often di&s;puted Point, a Standing Army; a Que|&s;tion which lies in le&s;s Compa&s;s than the many Words which have been made on one Side or other, would make us believe; I &s;hall in a few Words give a State of the Ca&s;e, and there|with conclude.</P>

<HEAD>Of a Standing ARMY.</HEAD>
<P>THE word <HI>Standing Army</HI> appears in &s;e|veral Shapes; but ought, as it is e&s;teem|ed a Grievance, to be under&s;tood only thus: (<HI>Viz.</HI>) A Standing Army maintained in Time of Peace.</P>
<P>It remains to &s;tate, What is, or is not a Time of Peace. And to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e it is &s;uffi|cient to &s;ay, that a Time of a threatned Inva|&s;ion, unconquer'd Di&s;affection, and formida|ble Faction, is not a Time of Peace; and that therefore in tho&s;e Ca&s;es the Word Standing Ar|my is out of the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>But when Alliances and Treaties, Pacifica|tions and Accommodations, Guarantees, and &s;uch like Things, have di&s;&s;ipated all our ju&s;t Fears from Abroad; and Rebellion, Faction, and Di&s;affection is &s;uppre&s;s'd and di&s;arm'd at Home; then indeed the Nation may be &s;aid to be in Peace, and a Standing Army may be cal|led a Grievance.</P>
<P>But as even then &s;ome Forces are nece&s;&s;ary to be kept up, and are kept up by all Nations, to &s;ecure and pre&s;erve that State of Peace, which alone makes a Standing Army needful at other Times: The only Que&s;tion then lies, What is, or is not a nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Medium</HI> be|tween the Extremes? What Number of Troops

may be acquie&s;c'd in, as nece&s;&s;ary for the pub|lick Safety, and what &s;hall be e&s;teemed dan|gerous to the Nation's Liberty?</P>
<P>The An&s;wer to this is &s;hort and ea&s;y, and was long ago di&s;cu&s;s'd, in An&s;wer to a Tract publi&s;hed again&s;t King <HI>William</HI>'s Army, at the Time of the Peace of <HI>Ry&s;wick</HI>; (<HI>Viz.</HI>) That the Parliament are and ought to be the Judges in the Ca&s;e: That &s;uch a Force as the Parlia|ment &s;hall judge needful, and that Force being always &s;ubjected to Parliamentary Authority, as to their Continuance, Increa&s;e, and De|crea&s;e; &s;uch a Force, and no other, the Nation will always be ea&s;y with, and &s;afe in: And &s;uch a Standing Army is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution of a <HI>Free Nation.</HI> Of this Opinion the Author of the&s;e Sheets ever was; and as he never &s;aw any &s;olid Rea&s;ons again&s;t it, &s;o he never wrote one Word incon&s;i&s;tent with it in his Life.</P>
<P>There needs but one Word to add to this; and that is, That we have all the Rea&s;on in the World to believe His Maje&s;ty will always be &s;atisfy'd with &s;uch a Settlement of Force; notwith&s;tanding the Schemes of our projecting Authors for formidable Forces at Home, and Nur&s;eries of Forces Abroad; in which it's very rea&s;onable to think they have no Dire|ction from the King: And this I gather from the la&s;t Words of his Maje&s;ty's Speech, the

mo&s;t engaging in this very Particular that could be &s;poken, from a Glorious Prince to a Loyal People; as follows.
<Q>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentleman,</HI></P>
<P>I have an Entire Confidence in You, and have therefore nothing to ask, but that You would take &s;uch Mea&s;ures as will be&s;t &s;ecure your Religion and Liberties: While You pre&s;erve the&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I &s;hall &s;it Safe and Ea&s;y on my Throne.</P>
