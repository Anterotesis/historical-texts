<HEAD>A DISCOURSE ON Antient and Modern LEARNING.</HEAD>
<P>THE pre&s;ent Age &s;eems to have a ve|ry true Ta&s;te of polite Learning, and perhaps takes the Beauties of an antient Au|thor, as much as 'tis po&s;&s;ible <HI>for it</HI> at &s;o great a Di&s;tance of Time. It may there|fore be &s;ome Entertainment to us to con&s;i|der what Plea&s;ure the Cotemporaries and Countrymen of our old Writers found in their Works, which we at pre&s;ent are not
<PB N="4" REF="3">
capable of; and whether at the &s;ame Time the Moderns mayn't have &s;ome Advantages peculiar to them&s;elves, and di&s;cover &s;everal Graces that ari&s;e merely from the Antiqui|ty of an Author.</P>
<P>AND here the fir&s;t and mo&s;t general Ad|vantage, the Ancients had over us, was, that they knew all the &s;ecret Hi&s;tory of a Compo&s;ure: What was the Occa&s;ion of &s;uch a Di&s;cour&s;e or Poem, whom &s;uch a Sentence aim'd at, what Per&s;on lay di&s;guis'd in &s;uch a Character: For by this means they cou'd &s;ee their Author in a Variety of Lights, and receive &s;everal different Entertainments from the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;age. We, on the con|trary, can only plea&s;e our&s;elves with the Wit or good Sen&s;e of a Writer, as it &s;tands &s;tripp'd of all tho&s;e accidental Circum&s;tan|ces that at fir&s;t help'd to &s;et it off: We have him but in a &s;ingle View, and only di&s;cover &s;uch e&s;&s;ential &s;tanding Beauties as no Time or Years can po&s;&s;ibly deface.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">I DON'T que&s;tion but <HI>Homer,</HI> who in the Diver&s;ity of his Characters has far excell'd all other Heroic Poets, had an Eye on &s;ome real Per&s;ons who were then living, in mo&s;t of 'em. The De&s;cription of <HI>Ther&s;ites</HI> is &s;o &s;piteful and particular, that I can't but think it one of his own, or his Country's Enemies in di&s;gui&s;e; as on the contrary, his <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> looks like the Figure of &s;ome antient and venerable Patriot: An effeminate Fop per|haps of tho&s;e Times lyes hid in <HI>Paris,</HI> and a crafty State&s;man in <HI>Uly&s;&s;es: Patroclus</HI> may be a Compliment on a celebrated Friend, and <HI>Agamemnon</HI> the De&s;cription of a maje&s;tic Prince. <HI>Ajax, Hector,</HI> and <HI>A|chilles</HI> are all of 'em valiant, but in &s;o dif|ferent a Manner, as perhaps has characte|ri&s;ed the different Kinds of Heroi&s;m that <HI>Homer</HI> had ob&s;erved in &s;ome of his great Cotemporaries. Thus far we learn from the Poet's Life, that he endeavoured to gain Favour and Patronage by his Ver&s;e; and 'tis very probable he thought on this Method
<PB N="6" REF="5">
of ingratiating him&s;elf with particular Per|&s;ons, as he has made the Drift of the whole Poem a Compliment on his Country in ge|neral.</P>
<P>AND to &s;hew us, that this is not a bare Conjecture only, we are told in the Account that is left us of <HI>Homer,</HI> that he in&s;erted the very Names of &s;ome of his Cotempora|ries. <HI>Tychius</HI> and <HI>Mentor</HI> in particular are very neatly celebrated in him. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was an hone&s;t Cobler, who had been very kind and &s;erviceable to the Poet, and is therefore advanc'd in his Poem, to be <HI>A|jax</HI>'s Shield-maker. The other was a great Man in <HI>Ithaca,</HI> who for his Patronage and Wi&s;dom has gained a very honourable Po&s;t in the <HI>Ody&s;&s;es,</HI> where he accompanies his great Countryman in his Travels, and gains &s;uch a Reputation for his Prudence, that <HI>Minerva</HI> took his &s;hape upon her when &s;he made her&s;elf vi&s;ible. <HI>Themius</HI> was the Name of <HI>Homer</HI>'s School-ma&s;ter, but the
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Poet has certainly drawn his own Character under, when he &s;ets him forth as a Favou|rite of <HI>Apollo,</HI> that was deprived of his Sight and u&s;ed to &s;ing the noble Exploits of the <HI>Grecians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>VIRGIL</HI> too may well be &s;uppos'd to give &s;everal Hints in his Poem, which we are not able to take, and to have lain many bye De&s;igns and Under-plots, which are too remote for us to look into di&s;tinctly at &s;o great a Di&s;tance: But as for the Charac|ters of &s;uch as lived in his own Time, I have not &s;o much to &s;ay of him as of <HI>Ho|mer.</HI> He is indeed very barren in this Part of his Poem, and has but little varied the Manners of the principal Per&s;ons in it. His <HI>Aeneas</HI> is a compound of Valour and Piety, <HI>Achates</HI> calls him&s;elf his Friend, but takes no Occa&s;ion of &s;hewing him&s;elf &s;o; <HI>Mne&s;teus, Serge&s;tus, Gyas,</HI> and <HI>Cloanthus</HI> are all of 'em Men of the &s;ame Stamp and Character.</P>
<Q>&mdash;Fortem&abque; Gyan, fortem&abque; Cloanthum.</Q>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">BESIDES <HI>Virgil</HI> was &s;o very nice and de|licate a Writer, that probably he might not think his Compliment to <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> &s;o great, or &s;o artfully concealed, if he had &s;cattered his Prai&s;es more promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and made his Court to others in the &s;ame Poem. Had he entertained any &s;uch De&s;ign <HI>Agrippa</HI> mu&s;t in ju&s;tice have challenged the &s;econd Place, and if <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s Repre&s;entative had been admitted, <HI>Aeneas</HI> would have had ve|ry little to do; which would not have re|dounded much to the Honour of his Em|peror. If therefore <HI>Virgil</HI> has &s;hadowed any great Per&s;ons be&s;ides <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> in his Characters, they are to be found only in the meaner Actors of his Poem, among the Di&s;puters for a petty Victory in the fifth Book, and perhaps in &s;ome few other Pla|ces. I &s;hall only mention <HI>Iopas</HI> the philo|&s;ophical Mu&s;ician at <HI>Dido</HI>'s Banquet, where I can't but fancy &s;ome celebrated Ma&s;ter complimented, for methinks the Epithet <HI>Crinitus</HI> is &s;o wholly foreign to the Pur|po&s;e,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
that it perfectly points at &s;ome parti|cular Per&s;on; who perhaps (to pur&s;ue a wandring Gue&s;s) was one of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Performers, then at <HI>Rome,</HI> for be&s;ides that they were the be&s;t Mu&s;icians and Philo&s;o|phers, the Termination of the Name be|longs to their Language, and the Epithet is the &s;ame [<GAP DESC="foreign">] that <HI>Homer</HI> gives to his Countrymen in general.</P>
<P>Now that we may have a right Notion of the Plea&s;ure we have lo&s;t on this Account, let us only con&s;ider the different Entertain|ment we of the pre&s;ent Age meet with, in Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>'s <HI>Ab&s;alom and Achitophel,</HI> from what an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Reader will find a Hund|red Years hence, when the Figures of the Per&s;ons concerned are not &s;o lively and fre&s;h in the Minds of Po&s;terity. Nothing can be more delightful than to &s;ee two Characters facing each other all along, and running parallel through the whole Piece, to com|pare Feature with Feature, to find out the
<PB N="10" REF="9">
nice Re&s;emblance in every Touch, and to &s;ee where the Copy fails, and where it comes up to the Original. The Reader can't but be pleas'd to have an Acquaintance thus ri&s;ing by degrees in his Imagination, for whil&s;t the Mind is bu&s;y in applying e|very Particular, and adju&s;ting the &s;everal Parts of the De&s;cription, it is not a little delighted with its Di&s;coveries, and feels &s;omething like the Satisfaction of an Au|thor from its own Compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>WHAT is here &s;aid of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil</HI> holds very &s;trong in the antient Satiri&s;ts and Authors of Dialogues, but e&s;pecially of Co|medies. What could we have made of <HI>A|ri&s;tophanes</HI>'s Clouds, had he not told us on whom the Ridicule turn'd; and we have good Rea&s;on to believe we &s;hould have re|li&s;h'd it more than we do, had we known the De&s;ign of each Character, and the &s;e|cret Intimations in every Line. Hi&s;tories them&s;elves often come down to us defective
<PB N="11" REF="10">
on this Account, where the Writers are not full enough to give us a perfect Notion of Occurrences, for the Tradition, which at fir&s;t was a Comment on the Story, is now quite lo&s;t, and the Writing only pre&s;erved for the Information of Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>I MIGHT be very tedious on this Head, but I &s;hall only mention another Author, who, I believe, received no &s;mall Advan|tage from this Con&s;ideration, and that is <HI>Theophra&s;tus,</HI> who probably has &s;hewn us &s;everal of his Cotemporaries, in the Repre|&s;entation of his Pa&s;&s;ions and Vices; for we may ob&s;erve in mo&s;t of his Characters &s;omething foreign to his Subject, and &s;ome other Folly or Infirmity mixing it&s;elf with the principal Argument of his Di&s;cour&s;e. His Eye &s;eems to have been &s;o attentively fixed on the Per&s;on in whom the Vanity reigned, that other Circum&s;tances of his Behaviour, be&s;ides tho&s;e he was to de&s;cribe, in&s;inuated them&s;elves unawares, and crept
<PB N="12" REF="11">
in&s;en&s;ibly into the Character. It was hard for him to extract a &s;ingle Folly out of the whole Ma&s;s, without leaving a little Mix|ture in the Separation: So that his particu|lar Vice appears &s;omething di&s;coloured in the De&s;cription, and his Di&s;cour&s;e, like a Gla&s;s &s;et to catch the Image of any &s;ingle Object, gives us a lively Re&s;emblance of what we look for; but at the &s;ame Time returns a little &s;hadowy Land&s;kip of the Parts that lye about it.</P>
<P>AND, as the Ancients enjoyed no &s;mall Privilege above us, in knowing the Per&s;ons hinted at in &s;everal of their Authors; &s;o they received a great Advantage, in &s;eeing often the Pictures and Images that are fre|quently de&s;cribed in many of their Poets. When <HI>Phidias</HI> had carved out his <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and the Spectators &s;tood a&s;toni&s;h'd at &s;o aw|ful and maje&s;tick a Figure, he &s;urprized them more, by telling them it was a Copy: And, to make his Words true, &s;hewed them the Original, in that magnificent De&s;cripti|on
<PB N="13" REF="12">
of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> towards the latter End of the fir&s;t <HI>Iliad.</HI> The comparing both to|gether probably di&s;cover'd &s;ecret Graces in each of 'em, and gave new Beauty to their Performances: Thus in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s fir&s;t <HI>Ae|neid,</HI> where we &s;ee the Repre&s;entation of Rage bound up, and chain'd in the Temple of <HI>Janus:</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash;Furor impius intus</L>
<L>Saeva &s;edens &s;uper arma, et centum vinctus ahenis</L>
<L>Po&s;t tergum nodis, fremit horridus ore cruento.</L></Q></P>
<P>THOUGH we are much plea&s;ed with &s;o wonderful a De&s;cription, how mu&s;t the Plea&s;ure double on tho&s;e who cou'd com|pare the Poet and the Statuary together, and &s;ee which had put mo&s;t Horror and Di&s;traction in his Figure. But we, who live in the&s;e lower Ages of the World, are &s;uch entire Strangers to this Kind of Di|ver&s;ion, that we often mi&s;take the De&s;cripti|on
<PB N="14" REF="13">
of a Picture for an Allegory, and don't &s;o much as know when it is hinted at. <HI>Ju|venal</HI> tells us a Flatterer will not &s;tick to compare a weak Pair of Shoulders to <HI>Her|cules,</HI> when he lifts <HI>Antaeus</HI> from the Earth. Now what a forc'd, unnatural Similitude does this &s;eem, amid&s;t the deep Silence of Scholia&s;ts and Commentators? But how full of Life and Humour, if we may &s;uppo&s;e it alluded to &s;ome remarkable Statue of the&s;e two Champions, that perhaps &s;tood in a public Place of the City? There is now in <HI>Rome</HI> a very antient Statue entangled in a Couple of Marble Serpents, and &s;o exactly cut i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Laccoon</HI>'s Po&s;ture and Circum&s;tances, that we may be &s;ure <HI>Virgil</HI> drew after the Statuary, or the Statuary after <HI>Virgil:</HI> And if the Poet was the Copyer, we may be &s;ure it was no &s;mall Plea&s;ure to a <HI>Roman,</HI> that could &s;ee &s;o celebrated an Image out|done in the De&s;cription.</P>
<P>I MIGHT here expatiate largely on &s;eve|ral
<PB N="15" REF="14" MS="y">
Cu&s;toms that are now forgotten, though often intimated by antient authors; and particularly on many Expre&s;&s;ions of their cotemporary Poets, which they had an Eye upon in their Reflections, tho' we at pre|&s;ent know nothing of the Bu&s;ine&s;s. Thus <HI>Ovid</HI> begins the &s;econd Book of his Elegies, with the&s;e two Lines:
<Q><L>Haec quoque &s;cribebam Pelignis natus aquo&s;is,</L>
<L>Ille ego nequitiae Na&s;o poeta meae.</L></Q></P>
<P>How far the&s;e may prove the four Ver|&s;es prefix'd to <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Aeneid</HI> genuine, I &s;hall not pretend to determine: But I dare &s;ay <HI>Ovid</HI> in this Place hints at 'em if they are &s;o, and I believe every Reader will a|gree that the Humour of the&s;e Lines wou'd be very much heightened by &s;uch an Allu|&s;ion, if we &s;uppo&s;e a Love Adventure u&s;h|ered in with an <HI>Ille Ego,</HI> and taking its Ri&s;e from &s;omething like a Preface to the <HI>Aeneid.</HI> Gue&s;&s;es might be numberle&s;s on this Occa|&s;ion,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
and though &s;ometimes they may be grounded fal&s;ly, yet they often give a new Plea&s;ure to the Reader, and throw in abun|dance of Light on the more intricate and ob&s;cure Pa&s;&s;ages of an antient Author.</P>
<P>BUT there is nothing we want more Di|rection in at pre&s;ent than the Writings of &s;uch antient Authors as abound with Hu|mour, e&s;pecially where the Humour runs in a Kind of Cant and a particular Set of Phra&s;es. We may indeed in many Places, by the Help of a good Scholia&s;t, and Skill in the Cu&s;toms and Language of a Coun|try, know that &s;uch Phra&s;es are humorous, and &s;uch a Metaphor drawn from a ridicu|lous Cu&s;tom; but at the &s;ame Time the Ri|dicule flags, and the Mirth langui&s;hes to a Modern Reader, who is not &s;o conver&s;ant and familiar with the Words and Ideas that lye before him; &s;o that the Spirit of the Je&s;t is quite pall'd and deaden'd, and the Bri&s;kne&s;s of an Expre&s;&s;ion lo&s;t to an Ear
<PB N="17" REF="16">
that is &s;o little accu&s;tomed to it. This Want of di&s;cerning between the comical and &s;eri|ous Stile of the Ancients, has run our mo|dern Editors and Commentators into a &s;en&s;e|le&s;s Affectation of <HI>Terence</HI>'s and <HI>Plautus</HI>'s Phra&s;es, when they de&s;ire to appear pure and cla&s;&s;ical in their Language: So that you often &s;ee the grave Pedant making a Buf|foon of him&s;elf, where he lea&s;t de&s;igns it, and running into light and trifling Phra&s;es, where he would fain appear &s;olemn and ju|dicious.</P>
<P>ANOTHER great Plea&s;ure the Ancients had beyond us, if we con&s;ider 'em as the Poet's Countrymen, was, that they lived as it were on the Spot, and within the Verge of the Poem; their Habitations lay among the Scenes of the <HI>Aeneid</HI>; they cou'd find out their own Country in <HI>Homer,</HI> and had every Day perhaps in their Sight the Mountain or Field where &s;uch an Adven|ture happen'd, or &s;uch a Battle was fought.
<PB N="18" REF="17">
Many of 'em had often walk'd on the Banks of <HI>Helicon,</HI> or the Sides of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> and knew all the private Haunts and Retire|ments of the Mu&s;es: So that they liv'd as it were on <HI>Fairy Ground,</HI> and convers'd in an enchanted Region, where every&punc; Thing they look'd upon appear'd romantick, and gave a thou&s;and plea&s;ing Hints to their Ima|ginations. To con&s;ider <HI>Virgil</HI> only in this Re&s;pect: How mu&s;t a <HI>Roman</HI> have been pleas'd that was well acquainted with the Capes and Promontories, to &s;ee the Origi|nal of their Names, as they &s;tand derived from <HI>Mi&s;enus, Palinurus</HI> and <HI>Cajeta?</HI> That cou'd follow the Poet's Motions, and attend his Hero in all his Marches from Place to Place? That was very well acquainted with the Lake <HI>Am&s;anctus,</HI> where the Fury &s;unk, and cou'd lead you to the Mouth of the Cave where <HI>Aeneas</HI> took his De&s;cent for Hell? Their being conver&s;ant with the Place where the Poem was tran&s;acted, gave 'em a greater Reli&s;h than we can have at
<PB N="19" REF="18">
pre&s;ent of &s;everal Parts of it; as it affected their Imaginations more &s;trongly, and dif|fu&s;ed through the whole Narration a great|er Air of Truth. The Places &s;tood as &s;o many Marks and Te&s;timonies to the Vera|city of the Story that was told of 'em, and helped the Reader to impo&s;e upon him&s;elf in the Credibility of the Relation. To con|&s;ider only that Pa&s;&s;age in the 8th <HI>Aeneid,</HI> where the Poet brings his Hero acquaint|ed with <HI>Evander,</HI> and gives him a Pro&s;pect of that Circuit of Ground, which was af|terwards cover'd with the Metropolis of the World. The Story of <HI>Cacus,</HI> which he there gives us at large, was probably rai&s;|ed on &s;ome old confus'd Tradition of the Place, and if &s;o, was doubly entertaining to a <HI>Roman,</HI> when he &s;aw it worked up into &s;o noble a Piece of Poetry, as it wou'd have pleas'd an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> to have &s;een in Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> any of the old Traditions of <HI>Guy</HI> varied and beautified in an Epi&s;ode, had the Chronology &s;uffered the Author to
<PB N="20" REF="19">
have led his Hero into <HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI> on that Occa&s;ion. The Map of the Place, which was afterwards the Seat of <HI>Rome,</HI> mu&s;t have been wonderfully plea&s;ing to one that lived upon it afterwards, and &s;aw all the Alterations that happened in &s;uch a Compa&s;s of Ground: Two Pa&s;&s;ages in it are inimitably fine, which I &s;hall here tran|&s;cribe, and leave the Reader to judge what Impre&s;&s;ions they made on the Imagination of a <HI>Roman,</HI> who had every Day before his Eyes the <HI>Capitol</HI> and the <HI>Forum,</HI>
<Q><L>Hinc ad Tarpeiam &s;edem et Capitolia ducit</L>
<L>Aurea nunc, olim &s;ilve&s;tribus horrida dumis.</L>
<L>Jam tum Religio pavidos terrebat agre&s;tes</L>
<L>Dira loci, jam tum &s;ilvam faxum&abque; tremebant.</L>
<L>Hoc nemus, hunc; inquit, frondo&s;o, vertice collem,</L>
<L>Quis Deus, incertum e&s;t, habitat Deus. Ar|cades ip&s;um</L>
<L>Credunt &s;e vidi&s;&s;e Jovem: Cum &s;aepe nigrantem</L>
<L>Aegida concuteret dextr&acirc;, nimbo&s;&abque; cieret.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="20">And afterwards&mdash;<HI>ad tecta &s;ubibant</HI>
<Q><L>Pauperis Evandri, pa&s;&s;im&abque; armenta videbant</L>
<L>Romano&abque; foro et lautis mugire carinis.</L></Q></P>
<P>THERE is another engaging Circum&s;tance that made <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> more particu|larly charming to their own Countrymen, than they can po&s;&s;ibly appear to any of the Moderns; and this they took hold of by choo&s;ing their Heroes out of their own Na|tion: For, by this Means, they have hu|mour'd and delighted the Vanity of a <HI>Greci|an</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> Reader, they have powerfully engaged him on the Hero's Side, and made him, as it were, a Party in every Action; &s;o that the Narration renders him more intent, the happy Events rai&s;e a greater Plea&s;ure in him, the pa&s;&s;ionate Part more moves him, and in a Word, the whole Poem comes more home, and touches him more nearly, than it would have done, had the Scene lain in another Country, and a Foreigner been the Subject of it. No doubt but the Inha|bitants
<PB N="22" REF="21">
of <HI>Ithaca</HI> preferr'd the <HI>Ody&s;&s;es</HI> to the <HI>Iliad,</HI> as the <HI>Myrmidons.</HI> on the con|trary, were not a little proud of their <HI>A|chilles.</HI> The Men of <HI>Pylos</HI> probably could repeat Word for Word the wi&s;e Sentences of <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI>; and we may well &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Aga|memnon</HI>'s Countrymen often pleas'd them|&s;elves with their Prince's Superiority in the <HI>Greek</HI> Confederacy. I believe therefore, no <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> reads <HI>Homer,</HI> or <HI>Virgil,</HI> with &s;uch an inward Triumph of Thought, and &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion of Glory, as tho&s;e who &s;aw in them the Exploits of their own Country|men or Ance&s;tors. And here by the Way, our <HI>Milton</HI> has been more univer&s;ally en|gaging in the Choice of his Per&s;ons, than any other Poet can po&s;&s;ibly be. He has o|bliged all Mankind, and related the whole Species to the two chief Actors in his Poem. Nay, what is infinitely more con&s;iderable, we behold in him, not only our Ance&s;tors, but our Repre&s;entatives. We are really en|gaged in their Adventures, and have a per|&s;onal
<PB N="23" REF="22">
Intere&s;t in their good or ill Succe&s;s. We are not only their Offspring, but Sharers in their Fortunes; and no le&s;s than our own eternal Happine&s;s, or Mi&s;ery, depends on their &s;ingle Conduct: So that ev'ry Rea|der will here find him&s;elf concerned, and have all his Attention and Solicitude rai&s;ed, in every Turn and Circum&s;tance of the whole Poem.</P>
<P>IF the Ancients took a greater Plea&s;ure in the Reading of their Poets than the Mo|derns can, their Plea&s;ure &s;till ro&s;e higher in the Peru&s;al of their Orators; tho' this I mu&s;t confe&s;s proceeded not &s;o much from their Precedence to us in re&s;pect of Time, as Judgment. Every City among them &s;warm'd with Rhetoricians, and every <HI>Se|nate-hou&s;e</HI> was almo&s;t filled with Orators; &s;o that they were perfectly well vers'd in all the Rules of Rhetorick, and perhaps knew &s;everal Secrets in the Art that let 'em into &s;uch Beauties of <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> or <HI>Cicero,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="23">
as are not yet di&s;covered by a modern Rea|der, And this I take to have been the chief Rea&s;on of that wonderful Efficacy we find a&s;crib'd to the antient Oratory, from what we meet with in the pre&s;ent; for, in all Arts, every Man is mo&s;t mov'd with the Perfection of 'em, as he under&s;tands 'em be&s;t. Now the Rulers of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> had generally &s;o well accompli&s;h'd them|&s;elves in the politer Parts of Learning, that they had a high Reli&s;h of a noble Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, were tran&s;ported with a well turn|ed Period, and not a little pleas'd to &s;ee a Rea&s;on urg'd in its full force. They knew how proper &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;age was to af|fect the Mind, and by admiring it, in&s;en&s;ibly begot in them&s;elves &s;uch a Motion as the O|rator de&s;ir'd. The Pa&s;&s;ion aro&s;e in 'em un|awares, from their con&s;idering the aptne&s;s of &s;uch Words to rai&s;e it. Accordingly, we find the Force of <HI>Tully</HI>'s Eloquence &s;hew'd it&s;elf mo&s;t on <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> who probably under&s;tood it be&s;t; and <HI>Cicero</HI> him&s;elf was
<PB N="25" REF="24">
&s;o affected with <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> that 'tis no Wonder when he was a&s;k'd, which he thought the be&s;t of his Orations, he &s;hou'd reply, <HI>The Longe&s;t.</HI> But now the Genera|lity of Mankind are &s;o wholly ignorant of the Charms of Oratory, that <HI>Tully</HI> him&s;elf, who guided the Lords of the whole Earth at his Plea&s;ure, were he now living, and a Speaker in a modern A&s;&s;embly, wou'd not, with all that divine Pomp and Heat of Elo|quence, be able to gain over one Man to his Party. The Vulgar indeed of every Age are equally mov'd by fal&s;e Strains of Rhetorick, but they are not the Per&s;ons I am here concern'd to account for.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t Circum&s;tance I &s;hall mention, which gave the Ancients a greater Plea&s;ure in the Reading of their own Authors than we are capable of, is that Knowledge they had of the Sound and Harmony of their Language, which the Moderns have at pre|&s;ent a very imperfect Notion of. We find,
<PB N="26" REF="25">
ev'n in Mu&s;ic, that different Nations have different Ta&s;tes of it, and tho&s;e who mo&s;t agree have &s;ome particular Manner and Graces proper to them&s;elves, that are not &s;o agreeable to a Foreigner: Whether or no it be that, as the Temper of the Cli|mates varies, it cau&s;es an Alteration in the animal Spirits, and the Organs of Hearing; or as &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ions reign mo&s;t in &s;uch a Country, &s;o the Sounds are mo&s;t plea&s;ing that mo&s;t affect tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions; or that the Sounds, which the Ear has been mo&s;t accu|&s;tomed to, in&s;en&s;ibly conform the &s;ecret Tex|ture of it to them&s;elves, and wear in it &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages as are be&s;t fitted for their own Re|ception; or in the la&s;t Place that our nati|onal Prejudice, and Narrowne&s;s of Mind, makes every thing appear odd to us that is new and uncommon: Whether any one, or all of the&s;e Rea&s;ons may be looked upon as the Cau&s;e, we find by certain Experience, that what is tuneful in one Country, is har&s;h and ungrateful in another. And if this
<PB N="27" REF="26">
Con&s;ideration holds in mu&s;ical Sounds, it does much more in tho&s;e that are articulate, becau&s;e there is a greater Variety of Syl|lables than of Notes, and the Ear is more accu&s;tom'd to Speech than Songs. But had we never &s;o good an Ear, we have &s;till a fault'ring Tongue, and a Kind of Impedi|ment in our Speech. Our Pronunciation is without doubt very widely different from that of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI>; and our Voices, in re&s;pect of theirs, are &s;o out of Tune, that, &s;hou'd an Ancient hear us, he wou'd think we were reading in another Tongue, and &s;carce be able to know his own Compo&s;ure, by our Repetition of it. We may be &s;ure, therefore, whatever ima|ginary Notions we may frame to our&s;elves, of the Harmony of an Author, they are very different from the Ideas which the Au|thor him&s;elf had of his own Performance.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee how Time has quite worn out, or decay'd &s;everal Beauties of our an|tient
<PB N="28" REF="27">
Authors; but to make a little Amends for the Graces they have lo&s;t, there are &s;ome few others which they have gather'd from their great Age and Antiquity in the World. And here we may fir&s;t ob&s;erve, how very few Pa&s;&s;ages in their Stile appear flat and low to a modern Reader, or carry in 'em a mean and vulgar Air of Expre&s;&s;i|on; which certainly ari&s;es, in a great Mea|&s;ure, from the Death and Difu&s;e of the Languages in which the Ancients compil'd their Works. Mo&s;t of the Forms of Speech, made u&s;e of in common Conver&s;ation, are apt to &s;ink the Dignity of a &s;erious Stile, and to take off from the Solemnity of the Compo&s;ition that admits them; nay, tho&s;e very Phra&s;es, that are in them&s;elves highly proper and &s;ignificant, and were at fir&s;t per|haps &s;tudy'd and elaborate Expre&s;&s;ions, make but a poor Figure in Writing, after they are once adopted into common Di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;ound over familiar to an Ear that is every where accu&s;tomed to them. They
<PB N="29" REF="28">
are too much di&s;honour'd by common U&s;e, and contract a Meanne&s;s, by pa&s;&s;ing &s;o fre|quently through the Mouths of the Vul|gar. For this Rea&s;on, we often meet with &s;omething of a Ba&s;ene&s;s in the Stiles of our be&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Authors, which we can't be &s;o &s;en&s;ible of in the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Writers; becau&s;e their Language is dead, and no more us'd in our familiar Conver&s;ations; &s;o that they have now laid a&s;ide all their natural Homeline&s;s and Simplicity, and appear to us in the Splendor and Formality of Stran|gers. We are not intimately enough ac|quainted with them, and never met with their Expre&s;&s;ions but in Print, and that too on a &s;erious Occa&s;ion; and therefore find nothing of that Levity or Meanne&s;s in the Ideas they give us, as they might convey in|to their Minds, who u&s;ed 'em as their Mo|ther-Tongue. To con&s;ider the <HI>Latin</HI> Po|ets in this Light, <HI>Ovid,</HI> in his <HI>Metamorpho|&s;is,</HI> and <HI>Lucan,</HI> in &s;everal Parts of him, are not a little beholden to Antiquity, for the
<PB N="30" REF="29">
Privilege I have here mentioned, who wou'd appear but very plain Men without it; as we may the better find, if we take 'em out of their Numbers, and &s;ee how naturally they fall into low Pro&s;e. <HI>Claudian</HI> and <HI>Sta|tius,</HI> on the Contrary, whil&s;t they endeavour too much to deviate from common and vul|gar Phra&s;es, clog their Ver&s;e with unnece&s;&s;a|ry Epithets, and &s;well their Stile with for|ced unnatural Expre&s;&s;ions, 'till they have blown it up into Bomba&s;t; &s;o that their Sen&s;e has much ado to &s;truggle thro' their Words. <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Horace,</HI> in his Odes, have run between the&s;e two Extremes, and made their Expre&s;&s;ions very &s;ublime, but at the &s;ame time very natural. This Con&s;ide|ration, therefore, lea&s;t affects them, for, tho' you take their Ver&s;e to Pieces, and di&s;po&s;e of their Words as you plea&s;e, you &s;till find &s;uch glorious Metaphors, Figures, and Epi|thets, as give it too great a Maje&s;ty for Pro&s;e, and look &s;omething like the Ruin of a noble Pile, where you &s;ee broken Pillars,
<PB N="31" REF="30">
&s;catter'd Obeli&s;ks, maim'd Statues, and a Magnificence in Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>AND as we are not much offended with the low Idioti&s;ms of a dead Language, &s;o neither are we very &s;en&s;ible of any familiar Words that are u&s;ed in it; as we may more particularly ob&s;erve in the Names of Per&s;ons and Places. We find in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wri|ters, how much the proper Name of one of our own Countrymen pulls down the Lan|guage that &s;urrounds it, and familiari&s;eth a whole Sentence. For our Ears are &s;o often u&s;ed to it, that we find &s;omething vulgar and common in the Sound and Cant; but fancy the Pomp and Solemnity of Stile too much humbled and depre&s;s'd by it. For this Rea|&s;on, the Authors of Poems and Romances, who are not tied up to any particular Set of proper Names, take the Liberty of invent|ing new ones, or at lea&s;t of chu&s;ing &s;uch as are not u&s;ed in their own Country; and, by this Means, not a little maintain the
<PB N="32" REF="31">
Grandeur and Maje&s;ty of their Language. Now the proper Names of a <HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> Author have the &s;ame Effect upon us as tho&s;e of a Romance, becau&s;e we meet with 'em no where el&s;e but in Books. <HI>Cato, Pompey,</HI> and <HI>Marcelles</HI> &s;ound as great in our Ears, who have none of their Families among us, as <HI>Agamemnon, Hector,</HI> and <HI>A|chilles</HI>; and therefore, tho' they might flat|ten an Oration of <HI>Tully</HI> to a <HI>Roman</HI> Reader, they have no &s;uch Effect upon an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> one. What I have here &s;aid, may perhaps give us the Rea&s;on why <HI>Virgil,</HI> when he mentions the Ance&s;tors of three noble <HI>Ro|man</HI> Families, turns <HI>Sergius, Memmius,</HI> and <HI>Ciuentius,</HI> which might have degraded his Ver&s;e too much, into <HI>Serge&s;tes, Mne&s;theus,</HI> and <HI>Cloanthus,</HI> though the three fir&s;t wou'd have been as high and &s;onorous to us as the other.</P>
<P>BUT though the Poets could make thus free with the proper Names of Per&s;ons,
<PB N="33" REF="32">
and in that re&s;pect enjoy'd a Privilege be|yond the Pro&s;e Writers; they lay both un|der an equal Obligation, as to the Names of Places: For there is no poetical Geogra|phy, Rivers are the &s;ame in Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e; and the Towns and Countries of a Romance differ nothing from tho&s;e of a true Hi&s;tory. How oddly therefore mu&s;t the Name of a paultry Village &s;ound to tho&s;e who were well acquainted with the Meanne&s;s of the Place; and yet how many &s;uch Names are to be met with in the Catalogues of <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil?</HI> Many of their Words mu&s;t therefore very much &s;hock the Ear of a <HI>Roman</HI> or <HI>Greek,</HI> e&s;pecially whil&s;t the Poem was new; and appear as meanly to their own Countrymen, as the Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham</HI>'s <HI>Putney Pikes</HI> and <HI>Chel&s;ea Curia&s;eers</HI> do to an <HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI> But the&s;e their Cata|logues have no &s;uch di&s;advantageous Sounds in 'em to the Ear of a Modern, who &s;carce ever hears of the Names out of the Poet, or knows any thing of the Places that be|long
<PB N="34" REF="33">
to them. <HI>London</HI> may &s;ound as well to a Foreigner, as <HI>Troy</HI> or <HI>Rome;</HI> and <HI>I&s;|lington</HI> perhaps better than <HI>London</HI> to them who have no di&s;tinct Ideas ari&s;ing from the Names. I have here only mention'd the Names of Men and Places; but we may ea|&s;ily carry the Ob&s;ervation further, to tho&s;e of &s;everal Plants, Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus, where <HI>Virgil</HI> compares the Flight of <HI>Mer|cury</HI> to that of a <HI>Water-Fowl, Servius</HI> tells us, that he purpo&s;ely omitted the Word <HI>Mergus,</HI> that he might not deba&s;e his Stile with it; which, tho' it might have offended the Nicene&s;s of a <HI>Roman</HI> Ear, wou'd have &s;ounded more tolerable in ours. <HI>Scaliger,</HI> indeed, ridicules the old Scholia&s;t for his Note; becau&s;e, as he ob&s;erves, the Word <HI>Mergus</HI> is u&s;ed by the &s;ame Poet in his <HI>Georgics.</HI> But the Critic &s;hou'd have con|&s;ider'd that, in the <HI>Georgics, Virgil</HI> &s;tudied De&s;cription more than Maje&s;ty; and there|fore might ju&s;tly admit a low Word into that Poem, which wou'd have di&s;graced his
<PB N="35" REF="34">
<HI>Aeneid;</HI> e&s;pecially when a God was to be join'd with it in the Compari&s;on.</P>
<P>As Antiquity thus conceals what is low and vulgar in an Author, &s;o does it draw a Kind of Veil over any Expre&s;&s;ion that is &s;train'd above Nature, and recedes too much from the familiar Forms of Speech. A vio|lent <HI>Greci&s;m,</HI> that wou'd &s;tartle a <HI>Roman</HI> at the Reading of it, &s;ounds more natural to us, and is le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hable from other Parts of the Stile. An ob&s;olete, or a new Word that made a &s;trange Appearance at fir&s;t to the Reader's Eye, is now incorpo|rated into the Tongue, and grown of a Piece with the re&s;t of the Language. And as for any bold Expre&s;&s;ions in a celebrated Ancient, we are &s;o far from di&s;liking 'em, that mo&s;t Readers &s;ingle out only &s;uch Pa&s;|&s;ages as are mo&s;t daring to commend; and take it for granted, that the Stile is beauti|ful and elegant, where they find it hard and unnatural. Thus has Time mellowed the
<PB N="36" REF="35">
Works of Antiquity, by qualifying, if I may &s;o &s;ay, the Strength and Rawne&s;s of their Colours, and ca&s;ting into Shades the Light that was at fir&s;t too violent and glaring for the Eye to behold with Plea&s;ure.</P>
