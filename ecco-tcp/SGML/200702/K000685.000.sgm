<L>And now the mighty Deed is greatly done,</L>
<L>A King reliev'd and Kingdoms bravely won;</L>
<L>The Warlike Chief, with Glory fir'd his Brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Forgot his Plea&s;ures, and for&s;ook his Re&s;t;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14">
The <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> fix'd he boldly onward bent,</L>
<L>And Conquer'd Rebel Countries as he went.</L>

<LG>
<L>The &s;tubborn <HI>Catalans,</HI> unus'd to bow,</L>
<L>Gladly &s;ubmit to firm Subjection now;</L>
<L>With joyful Shouts their happy Monarch greet,</L>
<L>And leave their Mountains for the Regal Seat;</L>
<L>That &s;trong-built Fort, who&s;e State the re&s;t excell'd,</L>
<L>And thrice Ten Thou&s;and <HI>Gallick</HI> Foes repell'd,</L>
<L>Afraid to &s;trive, her Iron Gates unlock'd,</L>
<L>And calmly open'd when <HI>CAMILLUS</HI> knock'd:</L>
<L>To his Succe&s;sful Arms whole Nations yield,</L>
<L>And freely give him up an untry'd Field;</L>
<L>At his ble&s;s'd Feet the Rich <HI>Torto&s;a</HI> lay,</L>
<L>And Matchle&s;s Conduct gain'd him <HI>Lerida;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Valencia</HI>'s Kingdom Gloriou&s;ly he won,</L>
<L>And triumph'd o'er the pro&s;trate <HI>Arragon.</HI></L>

<L>But hold, unwary Mu&s;e, no higher &s;oar,</L>
<L>He that did this, alas! mu&s;t do no more:</L>
<L>Oh! that thy Numbers cou'd but reach my Aim,</L>
<L>How wou'd I celebrate his Glorious Name!</L>
<L>How wou'd I Paint the Battles he has won,</L>
<L>And all the Noble Actions he has done!</L>
<L>How wou'd I Paint him &s;pilling Gen'rous Blood,</L>
<L>And tempting Death for his dear Country's good!</L>
<L>How wou'd I draw his two illu&s;trious Sons,</L>
<L>Proud of their mangled Fle&s;h and &s;hatter'd Bones!</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="15">
How wou'd I tune my elevated Song,</L>
<L>To Shame tho&s;e Men who do <HI>CAMILLUS</HI> wrong!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But &s;ince his VVorks thro' Clouds are forc'd to Shine,</L>
<L>How can I hope Succe&s;s for &s;uch as mine!</L>
<L>Let Vertue be Rewarded if it can,</L>
<L>VVhen Gratitude forgets &s;o Great a MAN.</L>
