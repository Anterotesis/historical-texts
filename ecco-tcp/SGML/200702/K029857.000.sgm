<HEAD>THE CASE OF <HI>Samuel Richard&s;on,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> Printer; With regard to the INVASION of his PROPERTY IN The Hi&s;tory of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, Before PUBLICATION, By certain BOOKSELLERS in <HI>Dublin.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE EDITOR of The HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON had intended to &s;end the Volumes of it, as he did tho&s;e of the HISTORY of CLARISSA HARLOWE, to be printed in <HI>Ireland,</HI> before he publi&s;hed them him&s;elf in <HI>London.</HI> Accordingly, when he had printed off &s;o con&s;iderable a Part of the Work, as would have con&s;tantly employed the Pre&s;s to which he purpo&s;ed to con&s;ign them, he &s;ent over 12 Sheets of the Fir&s;t Volume to Mr. <HI>George Faulkner;</HI> intending to follow it with the re&s;t, as Opportunity offered.</P>
<P>He had heard an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Book&s;eller boa&s;t, &s;ome Years ago, That he could procure from any Printing-Office in <HI>London,</HI> Sheets of any Book printing in it, while it was going on, and before Publication; and Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI> cautioning him on this Subject, with regard to this Work, he took particular Care to prevent, as he hoped, the Effects of &s;uch an infamous Corruption, as it mu&s;t be called; &s;ince it could not be done but by bribing the Journeymen or Servants of the <HI>London</HI> Printer. He gave a &s;trict Charge, before he put the Piece to Pre&s;s, to all his Workmen and Servants, as well in PRINT (that it might the &s;tronger impre&s;s them), as by Word of Mouth, to be on their Guard again&s;t any out-door Attacks. This was the Sub&s;tance of the printed Caution which he gave to his Workmen, on this Occa&s;ion: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A Book&s;eller of <HI>Dublin</HI> has a&s;&s;ured me, That he could get the Sheets of any Book from any Printing-hou&s;e in <HI>London,</HI> before Publication. I hope I may depend upon the Care and Circum&s;pection of my Friends, Compo&s;itors and Pre&s;s|men, that no Sheets of the Piece I am now putting to Pre&s;s be carried out of the Hou&s;e; nor any Notice taken of its being at Pre&s;s. It is of great Con&s;equence to me. Let no Stranger be admitted into any of the Work-rooms. Once more, I hope I may rely on the Integrity and Care of all my Workmen&mdash;And let all the Proofs, Revi&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be given to Mr. <HI>Tewley</HI>" [his Foreman], "to take care of."</Q></P>
<P>He had no Rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t their A&s;&s;urances; mo&s;t of them being Per&s;ons of experienced Hone&s;ty; and was plea&s;ed with their declared Abhorrence of &s;o vile a Treachery, and of all tho&s;e who &s;hould attempt to corrupt them. Yet, to be &s;till more &s;ecure, as he thought, he or|dered the Sheets, as they were printed off, to be depo&s;ited in a <HI>&s;eparate</HI> Warehou&s;e; the Care of which was entru&s;ted to One, on whom he had laid &s;uch Obligations, as, if he is guilty, has
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y">
made his Perfidy a Crime of the blacke&s;t Nature<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Peter Bi&s;hop,</HI> who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s was to read Proofs to the Corrector, and to employ his Lei&s;ure Hours in the Warehou&s;es; and who (and no other Per&s;on) being entru&s;ted with the Sheets of Sir <HI>Charles Grandi&s;on,</HI> as wrought off; and to lay-by Three Sheets of each of the Twelves Edition, and One of the Octavo, for Mr. <HI>Richard&s;on</HI>'s &s;ole U&s;e; had an Opportunity which no other Man, however inclined, could have, to perpetrate this Ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> on Su&s;picions too well-grounded, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> from his Service; and, after he was gone, having Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect <HI>Thomas Killingbeck,</HI> one of his Compo&s;itors, as the Confederate of <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> and by who&s;e means, he having worked &s;ome Years in <HI>Ireland,</HI> it was ea&s;y for him to manage this Piece of Treachery; and <HI>Killingbeck,</HI> on Examination, giving him Cau&s;e to &s;trengthen his Su&s;picions; yet a&s;&s;erting his Innocence; he propo&s;ed to him the &s;aid <HI>Killingbeck</HI> to draw up <HI>him&s;elf</HI> &s;uch an Affidavit as he thought he could &s;afely take, to exculpate him&s;elf. <HI>Killingbeck</HI> made poor Excu&s;es and Pretences; but, at la&s;t, took till the next Morning to draw it up. The next Morning he told Mr. <HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> that he was advi&s;ed not to draw up &s;uch an Affidavit; and gave &s;uch eva&s;ive Rea|&s;ons, as induced every body to believe him guilty. Upon this, Mr. <HI>Richard&s;on</HI> di&s;charged him from his Service. He left his Hou&s;e, pretending he would draw up &s;omething, as de&s;ired; but never &s;ince came near it; and is now applying for Work el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, Mr. <HI>Richard&s;on</HI> has received a Letter from <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> on Occa&s;ion of &s;ome Friend of his advi&s;ing him to an ample Confe&s;&s;ion; and to depend on that forgiving Temper which he had before experienced; in which he offers Circum&s;tances to prove that <HI>Killingbeck</HI> might find Opportunities to &s;teal the Sheets without his Con|nivance; tho', were <HI>that</HI> the Ca&s;e, none (after &s;uch repeated Warnings and Cautions) to clear him&s;elf of the mo&s;t culpable Negligence.</P></NOTE>. Having Three Printing-hou&s;es, he had them compo&s;ed, and wrought, by different Workmen, and at his different Hou&s;es; and took &s;uch other Precautions, that the Per&s;on to who&s;e Tru&s;t he committed them, being frequently que&s;tioned by him as to the Safety of the Work from Pirates, <HI>as</HI> frequently a&s;&s;ured him, That it was impo&s;&s;ible the Copy of any complete Volume could be come at, were there Per&s;ons in his Hou&s;e capable of being corrupted to attempt &s;o vile a Robbery.</P>
<P>What then mu&s;t be his Surprize, when Intelligence was &s;ent him from <HI>Dublin,</HI> That Copies of a con&s;iderable Part of his Work had been obtained by Three different Per&s;ons in that City; and that the Sheets were actually in the Pre&s;s? The <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Men publi&s;hed their own Names, in Three different Title-Pages &s;tuck up, in <HI>Dublin,</HI> in the following Words:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Dublin, Aug.</HI> 4. 1753. <HI>Speedily will be publi&s;hed,</HI> The HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON. In a Series of Letters Publi&s;hed from the Originals, By the EDITOR of PAMELA and CLARISSA. In Seven Volumes. <HI>Dublin:</HI> Printed by and for HENRY SAUNDERS, at the Corner of <HI>Chri&s;t-Church-Lane.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The Second:&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Aug.</HI> 4th, 1753. In the Pre&s;s, The HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON" (as in the other). "<HI>Dublin:</HI> Printed by JOHN EXSHAW, on <HI>Cork|hill.</HI>"</Q> </P>
<P>The Third:&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Dublin, Aug.</HI> 4th, 1753. <HI>In the Pre&s;s, and &s;peedily will be publi&s;hed,</HI> The HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON" (as in the Two others). "<HI>London:</HI> Printed for <HI>S. Richard&s;on:</HI>" [Vile Artifice!] "<HI>Dublin:</HI> Reprinted for PETER WILSON, in <HI>Dame-&s;treet.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The Editor had <HI>convincing</HI> Proofs given him, that one of the&s;e Men had procured a Copy of a con&s;iderable Part of the Work in <HI>Octavo;</HI> another in <HI>Duodecimo;</HI> and that they were proceeding to print it at &s;everal Pre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Terms having been agreed upon between Mr. <HI>Faulkner</HI> and the Editor, in Con&s;ideration of the Preference to be given him (One of which related to the Time of publi&s;hing the <HI>Dublin</HI> Edition, that it might not interfere with the Appearance of the <HI>London</HI> one) Mr. <HI>Faulkner,</HI> in con&s;equence of the &s;ucce&s;sful Corruption, &s;ignified to the Editor, that it was needle&s;s to &s;end him any more than the 12 Sheets he <HI>had</HI> &s;ent him; and that he had obtained a Fourth Share of the&s;e <HI>honourable</HI> Confederates: But that (to procure this Grace, as is &s;uppo&s;ed) he had been <HI>compelled,</HI> as he calls it, to deliver up to them, to print by, the Copy of the 12 Sheets afore&s;aid, which had &s;ome few Corrections in them, which occurred on a la&s;t Revi&s;al; but which are of no Moment with regard to the Hi&s;tory: Tho' po&s;&s;ibly this <HI>worthy</HI> Confederacy may make u&s;e of tho&s;e few Corrections in tho&s;e 12 Sheets, in order to recommend their &s;urreptitious Edition as preferable to that of the Proprietor. Of what will not Men be capable, who can corrupt the Servants of another Man to betray and rob their Ma&s;ter?</P>
<P>The Editor, who had al&s;o great Rea&s;on to complain of the Treatment he met with in his <HI>Pamela,</HI> on both Sides the Water, cannot but ob&s;erve, that never was Work more the Property of any Man, than <HI>this</HI> is his. The Copy never was in any other Hand: He borrows not from any Author: The Paper, the Printing, entirely at his own Expence, to a very large Amount; Returns of which he cannot &s;ee in &s;everal Months: Yet not troubling any of his Friends to le&s;&s;en his Ri&s;que by a Sub&s;cription: The Work, Copies of which have been &s;o <HI>immorally</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y">
obtained, is a <HI>moral</HI> Work: He has never hurt any Man; nor offended the&s;e: They would have had Benefits from the Sale, which the Editor could not have, being not a Book&s;eller; and he always making full and hand&s;ome allowances <HI>to</HI> Book&s;ellers.</P>
<P>But nothing le&s;s, it &s;eems, would content the&s;e Men, than an Attempt to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of his whole Property, without Notice, Leave, Condition, or Offer at Condition; and they are ha&s;tening the Work at &s;everal Pre&s;&s;es, po&s;&s;ibly with a View to publi&s;h their piratical Edition before the lawful Proprietor can publi&s;h his. And who can &s;ay, that, if they can get it out before him, they will not adverti&s;e, that <HI>his</HI> is a Piracy upon <HI>theirs?</HI></P>
<P>Yet the&s;e Men know, that they have obtained the Parts of the Work they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, at the Price of making an innocent Man un&s;afe in his own Hou&s;e; and of di&s;honouring him in the Opinion of his Employers; who, probably, may not choo&s;e to tru&s;t their Property in the Hands of a Man, who cannot &s;ecure his own from inte&s;tine Traitors.</P>
<P>Since the above was written, Mr. <HI>Richard&s;on</HI> has been acquainted, that his Work is now print|ing at Four &s;everal Printing-hou&s;es in <HI>Dublin,</HI> for the Benefit of the Confederacy; <HI>viz.</HI> Two Volumes at Mrs. <HI>Reiley</HI>'s; One at Mr. <HI>William&s;on</HI>'s; One at Mr. <HI>Powell</HI>'s; One at Mr. <HI>M'Culloch</HI>'s; and that they hope at Mrs. <HI>Reiley</HI>'s to get another Volume to print; and are driving on to fini&s;h their Two Volumes for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Work will make Seven Volumes in <HI>Twelves;</HI> Six in <HI>Octavo;</HI> and he apprehends, from the Quantity he him&s;elf had printed, when the Fraud was di&s;covered, that the Confederacy have got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Five entire Volumes, the greate&s;t Part of the Sixth, and of &s;everal Sheets of the Seventh and la&s;t; but the Work being &s;topt when the Wickedne&s;s was known, they can|not have the better Half of the concluding Volume.</P>
<P>He is further a&s;&s;ured, that the&s;e worthy Men are in Treaty with Book&s;ellers in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for their printing his Work, in that Part of the United Kingdom, from Copies that they are to fur|ni&s;h; and al&s;o, that they purpo&s;e to &s;end a Copy to <HI>France,</HI> to be tran&s;lated there, before Publi|cation: No doubt for pecuniary Con&s;iderations; and in order to propagate, to the utmo&s;t, the Injury done to One, who never did any to them; and who, till this Proceeding, he ble&s;&s;es God, knew not that there were &s;uch Men in the World among tho&s;e who could look out in broad and open Day.</P>
<P>It has been cu&s;tomary for the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Book&s;ellers to make a Scramble among them&s;elves who &s;hould fir&s;t intitle him&s;elf to the Reprinting of a new <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Book; and happy was he, who could get his Agents in <HI>England</HI> to &s;end him a Copy of a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;aleable Piece, <HI>as &s;oon as it was printed,</HI> and <HI>ready to be publi&s;hed.</HI> This Kind of Property was never conte&s;ted with them by Authors <HI>in England;</HI> and it was agreed among <HI>them&s;elves</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> among the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Book&s;ellers and Printers) to be a <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> Title; tho' now-and-then a <HI>Shark</HI> was found, who preyed on <HI>his own Kind;</HI> as the News-papers of <HI>Dublin</HI> have te&s;tified. But the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Ca&s;e will &s;hew to what a Height of Ba&s;e|ne&s;s &s;uch an undi&s;puted Licence is arrived.</P>
<P>After all, if there is no Law to right the Editor and &s;ole Proprietor of this new Work <HI>(New</HI> in every Sen&s;e of the Word), he mu&s;t acquie&s;ce; but with this Hope, that, from &s;o flagrant an Attempt, a Law may one Day be thought nece&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;ecure to Authors the Benefit of their own Labours: Nor does he wi&s;h, that even the&s;e Invaders of his Property in <HI>Ireland</HI> may be excluded from the Benefit of it, in the Property of any of the Works to which they are, or &s;hall be, fairly and lawfully intitled. At pre&s;ent, the <HI>Engli&s;h Writers</HI> may be &s;aid, from the Attempts and Practices of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Book&s;ellers and Printers, to live in an Age of <HI>Liberty,</HI> but not of <HI>Property.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> This is not a Contention between Book&s;ellers of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and on a <HI>doubtful</HI> Property; but between a lawful Proprietor of a <HI>New</HI> and <HI>Moral</HI> Work &mdash; AND <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> Let Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Wil&s;on, Ex&s;haw,</HI> and <HI>Saunders,</HI> reflecting upon the Steps they have taken, and making the Ca&s;e <HI>their own</HI> (for they no doubt have Servants)&mdash;fill up the Blank.</P>
