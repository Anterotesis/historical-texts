<P>IN reading &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of the prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> which
foretell the coming of Chri&s;t and the felicities attending it,
I could not but ob&s;erve a remarkable parity between many of
the thoughts, and tho&s;e in the Pollio of <HI>Virgil.</HI> This will
not &s;eem &s;urpri&s;ing, when we reflect, that the Eclogue was
taken from a Sibylline prophecy on the &s;ame &s;ubject. One
may judge that <HI>Virgil</HI> did not copy it line by line, but &s;e|lected
&s;uch ideas as be&s;t agreed with the nature of pa&s;toral
poetry, and di&s;po&s;ed them in that manner which &s;erved mo&s;t
to beautify his piece. I have endeavoured the &s;ame in this
imitation of him, though without admitting any thing of my
own; &s;ince it was written with this particular view, that
the reader, by comparing the &s;everal thoughts, might &s;ee how
for the images and de&s;criptions of the Prophet are &s;uperior
to tho&s;e of the Poet. But as I fear I have prejudiced
them by my management, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin the pa&s;&s;ages of
<HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Virgil,</HI> under the &s;ame di&s;advantage
of a literal tran&s;lation.</P>
