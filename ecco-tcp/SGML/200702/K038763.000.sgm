<HEAD>LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>APPROACHING towards the clo&s;e of a long period of public &s;ervice, it is natural I &s;hould be de&s;irous to &s;tand well (I hope I do &s;tand tolerably well) with that public, which, with whatever fortune, I have endeavoured faithfully and zealou&s;ly, to &s;erve.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o not a little anxious for &s;ome place in the e&s;timation of the two per&s;ons to whom I addre&s;s this paper. I have always acted with them, and with tho&s;e whom they repre&s;ent. To my knowledge I have not deviated, no not in the minute&s;t point, from
<PB N="2" REF="6">
their opinions and principles. Of late, with|out any alteration in their &s;entiments, or in mine, a difference of a very unu&s;ual na|ture, and which, under the circum&s;tances, it is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe, has ari&s;en between us.</P>
<P>In my journey with them through life, I met Mr. Fox in my road; and I travelled with him very-chearfully as long as he ap|peared to me to pur&s;ue the &s;ame direction with tho&s;e in who&s;e company I &s;et out. In the latter &s;tage of our progre&s;s, a new &s;cheme of liberty and equality was produced in the world, which either dazzled his ima|gination, or was &s;uited to &s;ome new walks of ambition, which were then opened to his view. The whole frame and fa&s;hion of his politics appear to have &s;uffered about that time a very material alteration. It is about three years &s;ince, in con&s;equence of that ex|traordinary change, that, after a pretty long preceding period of di&s;tance, coolne&s;s, and want of confidence, if not total alienation on his part, a compleat public &s;eparation has been made between that gentleman and me. Until lately the breach between us appeared
<PB N="3" REF="7">
reparable. I tru&s;ted that time and reflec|tion, and a deci&s;ive experience of the mi&s;|chiefs which have flowed from the proceed|ings and the &s;y&s;tem of France, on which our difference had ari&s;en, as well as the known &s;entiments of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of our common friends upon that &s;ubject, would have brought him to a &s;afer way of thinking. Several of his friends &s;aw no &s;e|curity for keeping things in a proper train after this excur&s;ion of his, but in the re|union of the party on its old grounds, under the Duke of Portland. Mr. Fox, if he plea&s;ed, might have been comprehended in that &s;y&s;tem, with the rank and con&s;ideration to which his great talents entitle him, and indeed mu&s;t &s;ecure to him in any party ar|rangement that <HI>could</HI> be made. The Duke of Portland knows how much I wi&s;hed for, and how earne&s;tly I laboured that re-union, and upon terms that might every way be honourable and advantageous to Mr. Fox.&mdash;His conduct in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion has extin|gui&s;hed the&s;e hopes for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="8">Mr. Fox has lately publi&s;hed in print, a defence of his conduct. On taking into con&s;ideration that defence, a &s;ociety of gen|tlemen, called the Whig Club, thought proper to come to the following re&s;olution&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That their confidence in Mr. Fox is con|firmed, &s;trengthened, and encrea&s;ed, by the calumnies again&s;t him."</Q></P>
<P>To that re&s;olution my two noble friends, the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam, have given their concurrence.</P>
<P>The calumnies &s;uppo&s;ed in that re&s;olution, can be nothing el&s;e than the objections taken to Mr. Fox's conduct in this &s;e&s;&s;ion of Par|liament; for to them, and to them alone, the re&s;olution refers. I am one of tho&s;e who have publicly and &s;trongly urged tho&s;e objections. I hope I &s;hall be thought only to do what is nece&s;&s;ary to my ju&s;tifica|tion, thus publicly, &s;olemnly,and heavily cen|&s;ured by tho&s;e whom I mo&s;t value and e&s;teem, when I firmly contend, that the objections which I, with many others of the friends to the Duke of Portland, have made to Mr.
<PB N="5" REF="9">
Fox's conduct, are not <HI>calumnies,</HI> but founded on truth; that they are not <HI>few,</HI> but many; and that they are not <HI>light and trivial,</HI> but in a very high degree, &s;erious and impor|tant.</P>
<P>That I may avoid the imputation of throw|ing out, even privately, any loo&s;e random imputations again&s;t the public conduct of a gentleman, for whom I once entertained a very warm affection, and who&s;e abilities I regard with the greate&s;t admiration, I will put down di&s;tinctly and articulately, &s;ome of the matters of objection which I feel to his late doctrines and proceedings, tru&s;ting that I &s;hall be able to demon&s;trate to the friends, who&s;e good opinion I would &s;till cultivate, that not levity, nor caprice, nor le&s;s defen&s;ible motives, but that very grave rea&s;ons influence my judgment. I think that the &s;pirit of his late proceedings is wholly alien to our national policy, and to the peace, to the pro&s;perity, and to the le|gal liberties of this nation, <HI>according to our ancient dome&s;tic and appropriated mode of hold|ing them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="10">Viewing things in that light, my confi|dence in him is not encrea&s;ed, but totally de&s;troyed by tho&s;e proceedings. I cannot conceive it a matter of honour or duty (but the direct contrary) in any member of par|liament, to continue a &s;y&s;tematic oppo&s;ition for the purpo&s;e of putting Government un|der difficulties, until Mr. Fox (with all his pre&s;ent ideas) &s;hall have the principal direc|tion of affairs placed in his hands; and until the pre&s;ent body of admini&s;tration (with their ideas and mea&s;ures) is of cour&s;e overturned and di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>To come to particulars:</P>
<P N="1">1. The Laws and Con&s;titution of the Kingdom, entru&s;t the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right of treating with foreign potentates, to the King. This is an undi&s;puted part of the legal prerogative of the Crown. How|ever, notwith&s;tanding this, Mr. Fox, with|out the knowledge or participation of any one per&s;on in the Hou&s;e of Commons, with whom he was bound by every party prin|ciple, in matters of delicacy and importance,
<PB N="7" REF="11">
confidentially to communicate, thought pro|per to &s;end Mr. Adair, as his repre&s;entative, and with his cypher, to St. Peter&s;burgh, there to fru&s;trate the objects for which the Mini&s;ter from the Crown was authorized to treat. He &s;ucceeded in this his de&s;ign, and did ac|tually fru&s;trate the King's Mini&s;ter in &s;ome of the objects of his negociation.</P>
<P>This proceeding of Mr. Fox does not (as I conceive) amount to ab&s;olute high trea&s;on; Ru&s;&s;ia, though on bad terms, not having been then declaredly at war with this king|dom. But &s;uch a proceeding is, in law, not very remote from that offence, and is un|doubtedly a mo&s;t uncon&s;titutional act, and an high trea&s;onable mi&s;demeanor.</P>
<P>The legitimate and &s;ure mode of commu|nication between this nation and foreign powers, is rendered uncertain, precarious, and treacherous, by being divided into two channels, one with a Government, one with the head of a party in oppo&s;ition to that Go|vernment; by which means the foreign
<PB N="8" REF="12">
powers can never be a&s;&s;ured of the real au|thority or validity of any public tran&s;action what&s;oever.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the advantage taken of the di&s;content which at that time prevailed in parliament and in the nation, to give to an individual an influence directly again&s;t the Government of his country, in a foreign court, has made a highway into England for the intrigues of foreign courts in our af|fairs. This is a &s;ore evil; an evil from which, before this time, England was more free than any other nation. Nothing can pre&s;erve us from that evil&mdash;which connects cabinet factions with popular factions here and abroad&mdash;but the keeping &s;acred the Crown, as the only channel of communica|tion with every other nation.</P>
<P>This proceeding of Mr. Fox has given a &s;trong countenance and an encouraging ex|ample to the doctrines and practices of the Revolution and Con&s;titutional Societies, and of other mi&s;chievous &s;ocieties of that de|&s;cription, who, without any legal authority,
<PB N="9" REF="13">
and even without any corporate capacity, are in the habit of propo&s;ing, and to the be&s;t of their power, of forming leagues and alli|ances with France.</P>
<P>This proceeding, which ought to be re|probated on all the general principles of go|vernment, is, in a more narrow view of things, not le&s;s reprehen&s;ible. It tends to the prejudice of the whole of the Duke of Portland's late party, by di&s;crediting the principles upon which they &s;upported Mr. Fox in the Ru&s;&s;ian bu&s;ine&s;s, as if they, of that party al&s;o, had proceeded in their parlia|mentary oppo&s;ition, on the &s;ame mi&s;chievous principles which actuated Mr. Fox in &s;end|ing Mr. Adair on his emba&s;&s;y.</P>
<P N="2">2. Very &s;oon after his &s;ending this em|ba&s;&s;y to Ru&s;&s;ia, that is, in the Spring of 1792, a covenanting club or a&s;&s;ociation was formed in London, calling it&s;elf by the am|bitious and invidious title of <Q REND="inline">"<HI>The Friends of the People.</HI>"</Q> It was compo&s;ed of many of Mr. Fox's own mo&s;t intimate, per&s;onal and party friends, joined to a very con&s;iderable
<PB N="10" REF="14">
part of the members of tho&s;e mi&s;chievous a&s;&s;ociations called the Revolution Society, and the Con&s;titutional Society. Mr. Fox mu&s;t have been well apprized of the progre&s;s of that &s;ociety, in every one of its &s;teps; if not of the very origin of it. I certainly was informed of both, who had no connection with the de&s;ign, directly or indirectly. His influence over the per&s;ons who compo&s;ed the leading part in that a&s;&s;ociation, was, and is unbounded. I hear, that he expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;approbation of this club in one ca&s;e, (that of Mr. St. John) where his con&s;ent was formally a&s;ked; yet he never attempted &s;eriou&s;ly to put a &s;top to the a&s;&s;ociation, or to di&s;avow it, or to controul, check, or modify it in any way what&s;oever. If he had plea&s;ed, without difficulty, he might have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it in its beginning. However, he did not only not &s;uppre&s;s it in its beginning, but encou|raged it in every part of its progre&s;s, at that particular time, when Jacobin Clubs (under the very &s;ame, or &s;imilar titles) were making &s;uch dreadful havock in a country not thirty miles from the coa&s;t of England, and when every motive of moral prudence called for
<PB N="11" REF="15">
the di&s;couragement of &s;ocieties formed for the encrea&s;e of popular preten&s;ions to power and direction.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the proceedings of this &s;ociety of the Friends of the People, as well as others acting in the &s;ame &s;pirit, had cau&s;ed a very &s;erious alarm in the mind of the Duke of Portland, and of many good patriots, he publicly, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, treated their apprehen&s;ions and conduct with the greate&s;t a&s;perity and ridicule. He condemned and vilified, in the mo&s;t in&s;ulting and out|rageous terms, the proclamation i&s;&s;ued by Go|vernment on that occa&s;ion&mdash;though he well knew, that it had pa&s;&s;ed through the Duke of Portland's hands, that it had received his fulle&s;t approbation, and that it was the re|&s;ult of an actual interview between that noble Duke and Mr. Pitt. During the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of its merits in the Hou&s;e of Commons, Mr. Fox countenanced and ju&s;tified the chief promoters of that a&s;&s;ociation; and he re|ceived in return, a public a&s;&s;urance from them of an inviolable adherence to him, &s;ingly and per&s;onally. On account of this
<PB N="12" REF="16">
proceeding, a very great number (I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, not the lea&s;t grave and wi&s;e part) of the Duke of Portland's friends in Parliament, and many out of Parliament, who are of the &s;ame de&s;cription, have become &s;eparated from that time to this from Mr. Fox's particular Cabal; very few of which Cabal are, or ever have, &s;o much as pretended to be attached to the Duke of Portland, or to pay any re|&s;pect to him or his opinions.</P>
<P N="4">4. At the beginning of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, when the &s;ober part of the nation was a &s;econd time generally and ju&s;tly alarmed at the pro|gre&s;s of the French arms on the Continent, and at the &s;preading of their horrid princi|ples and cabals in England, Mr. Fox did not (as had been u&s;ual in ca&s;es of far le&s;s moment) call together any meeting of the Duke of Portland's friends in the Hou&s;e of Commons, for the purpo&s;e of taking their opinion on the conduct to be pur&s;ued in Par|liament at that critical juncture. He con|certed his mea&s;ures (if with any per&s;ons at all) with the friends of Lord Lan&s;downe, and tho&s;e calling them&s;elves Friends of the
<PB N="13" REF="17">
People, and others not in the &s;malle&s;t de|gree attached to the Duke of Portland; by which conduct he wilfully gave up (in my opinion) all preten&s;ions to be con&s;idered as of that party, and much more of being con|&s;idered as the Leader and Mouth of it in the Hou&s;e of Commons. This could not give much encouragement to tho&s;e who had been &s;eparated from Mr. Fox, on account of his conduct on the fir&s;t proclamation, to rejoin that party.</P>
<P N="5">5. Not having con&s;ulted any of his party in the Hou&s;e of Commons; and not having con&s;ulted them becau&s;e he had rea&s;on to know that the cour&s;e he had re&s;olved to pur|&s;ue would be highly di&s;agreeable to them, he repre&s;ented the alarm, which was a &s;e|cond time given and taken, in &s;till more invidious colours than tho&s;e in which he painted the alarms of the former year. He de&s;cribed tho&s;e alarms in this manner, al|though the cau&s;e of them was then grown far le&s;s equivocal, and far more urgent. He even went &s;o far as to treat the &s;uppo&s;ition of the growth of a Jacobin &s;pirit in England
<PB N="14" REF="18">
as a libel on the nation. As to the danger from <HI>abroad,</HI> on the fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, he &s;aid little or nothing upon the &s;ubject. He contented him&s;elf with defending the ruling factions in France, and with accu&s;ing the public Councils of this kingdom of every &s;ort of evil de&s;ign on the liberties of the peo|ple; declaring di&s;tinctly, &s;trongly, and pre|ci&s;ely, that the whole danger of the nation was from the growth of the Power of the Crown. The policy of this declaration was obvious. It was in &s;ub&s;ervience to the ge|neral plan of di&s;abling us from taking any &s;teps again&s;t France. To counteract the alarm given by the progre&s;s of Jacobin arms and principles, he endeavoured to excite an oppo&s;ite alarm concerning the growth of the Power of the Crown. If that alarm &s;hould prevail, he knew that the nation never would be brought by arms to oppo&s;e the growth of the Jacobin empire; becau&s;e it is obvious that war does, in its very nature, nece&s;&s;itate the Commons con&s;iderably to &s;trengthen the hands of Government; and if that &s;trength &s;hould it&s;elf be the object of terror, we could have no war.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="15" REF="19">6. In the extraordinary and violent &s;peeches of that day, he attributed all the evils which the public had &s;uffered to the Proclamation of the preceding &s;ummer, though he &s;poke in pre&s;ence of the Duke of Portland's own &s;on, the Marquis of Titch-field, who had &s;econded the Addre&s;s on that Proclamation; and in pre&s;ence of the Duke of Portland's brother, Lord Edward Ben|tinck, and &s;everal others of his be&s;t friends and neare&s;t relations.</P>
<P N="7">7. On that day, that is, on the 13th of December, 1792, he propo&s;ed an amend|ment to the Addre&s;s, which &s;tands on the Journals of the Hou&s;e, and which is, per|haps, the mo&s;t extraordinary record which ever did &s;tand upon them. To introduce this amendment, he not only &s;truck out the part of the propo&s;ed Addre&s;s which alluded to in&s;urrections, upon the ground of the ob|jections which he took to the legality of the calling together Parliament, (objections which I mu&s;t ever think litigious and &s;ophi&s;|tical) but he likewi&s;e &s;truck out that <HI>part which related to the Cabals and Con&s;piracies</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="20">
<HI>of the French Faction in England,</HI> although their practices and corre&s;pondences were of public notoriety. Mr. Cooper and Mr. Watt had been deputed from Manche&s;ter to the Jacobins. The&s;e amba&s;&s;adors were re|ceived by them as Briti&s;h Repre&s;entatives; other deputations of Engli&s;h had been re|ceived at the bar of the National A&s;&s;embly; they had gone the length of giving &s;upplies to the Jacobin armies; and they in return had received promi&s;es of military a&s;&s;i&s;tance to forward their de&s;igns in England; a re|gular corre&s;pondence for fraternizing the two nations had al&s;o been carried on by &s;o|cieties in London with a great number of the Jacobin &s;ocieties in France; this corre&s;|pondence had al&s;o for its object the pretended improvement of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution.&mdash;What is the mo&s;t remarkable, and by much the more mi&s;chievous part of his proceedings that day, Mr. Fox likewi&s;e &s;truck out every thing in the Addre&s;s which <HI>related to the tokens of Ambition given by France, her ag|gre&s;&s;ions upon our allies, and the &s;udden and dangerous growth of her power upon every &s;ide</HI>; and in&s;tead of all tho&s;e weighty, and
<PB N="17" REF="21">
at that time, nece&s;&s;ary matters, by which the Hou&s;e of Commons was (in a cri|&s;is, &s;uch as perhaps Europe never &s;tood) to give a&s;&s;urances to our allies, &s;trength to our Government, and a check to the com|mon enemy of Europe, he &s;ub&s;tituted no|thing but a criminal charge on the conduct of the Briti&s;h Government for calling Parlia|ment together, and an engagement to en|quire into that conduct.</P>
<P N="8">8. If it had plea&s;ed God to &s;uffer him to &s;ucceed in this his project, for the amend|ment to the Addre&s;s, he would for ever have ruined this nation, along with the re&s;t of Europe. At home all the Jacobin &s;ocieties, formed for the utter de&s;truction of our Con|&s;titution, would have lifted up their heads, which had been beaten down by the two Proclamations. Tho&s;e &s;ocieties would have been infinitely &s;trengthened and multiplied in every quarter; their dangerous foreign communications would have been left broad and open; the Crown would not have been authorized to take any mea&s;ure whatever for our immediate defence by &s;ea or land. The
<PB N="18" REF="22">
clo&s;e&s;t, the mo&s;t natural, the neare&s;t, and, at the &s;ame time, from many internal as well as external circum&s;tances, the weake&s;t of our allies, Holland, would have been given up, bound hand and foot, to France, ju&s;t on the point of invading that republic. A general con&s;ternation would have &s;eized upon all Europe; and all alliance with every other power, except France, would have been for ever rendered impracticable to us. I think it impo&s;&s;ible for any man, who re|gards the dignity and &s;afety of his country, or indeed the common &s;afety of mankind, ever to forget Mr. Fox's proceedings in that tremendous cri&s;is of all human affairs.</P>
<P N="9">9. Mr. Fox very &s;oon had rea&s;on to be appri&s;ed of the general di&s;like of the Duke of Portland's friends to this conduct. Some of tho&s;e who had even voted with him, the day after their vote expre&s;&s;ed their abhor|rence of his amendment, their &s;en&s;e of its inevitable tendency, and their total aliena|tion from the principles and maxims upon which it was made; yet, the very next day, that is, on Friday, the 14th of December, he
<PB N="19" REF="23">
brought on what in effect was the very &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, and on the &s;ame principles, a <HI>&s;e|cond</HI> time.</P>
<P N="10">10. Although the Hou&s;e does not u&s;ually &s;it on Saturday, he a <HI>third</HI> time brought on another propo&s;ition, in the &s;ame &s;pirit, and pur&s;ued it with &s;o much heat and per&s;eve|rance as to &s;it into Sunday; a thing not known in Parliament for many years.</P>
<P N="11">11. In all the&s;e motions and debates he wholly departed from all the political prin|ciples relative to France, (con&s;idered merely as a &s;tate, and independent of its Jacobin form of government) which had hitherto been held fundamental in this country, and which he had him&s;elf held more &s;trongly than any man in Parliament. He at that time &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;eparated him&s;elf from tho&s;e to who&s;e &s;entiments he u&s;ed to profe&s;s no &s;mall regard, although tho&s;e &s;entiments were pub|licly declared. I had then no concern in the party, having been for &s;ome time, with all outrage, excluded from it; but, on ge|neral principles, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that a per&s;on
<PB N="20" REF="24">
who a&s;&s;umes to be leader of a party com|po&s;ed of freemen and of gentlemen, ought to pay &s;ome degree of deference to their feel|ings, and even to their prejudices. He ought to have &s;ome degree of management for their credit and influence in their country. He &s;hewed &s;o very little of this delicacy, that he compared the alarm rai&s;ed in the minds of the Duke of Portland's party, (which was his own) an alarm in which they &s;ympathized with the greater part of the nation, to the panic produced by the pretended Popi&s;h plot in the reign of Charles the Second&mdash;de&s;cribing it to be, as that was, a contrivance of knaves, and believed only by well-meaning dupes and madmen.</P>
<P N="12">12. The Monday following, (the 17th of December) he pur&s;ued the &s;ame conduct.&mdash;The means u&s;ed in England to co-operate with the Jacobin army in politics agreed; that is, the mi&s;chievous writings circulated with much indu&s;try and &s;ucce&s;s, as well as the &s;editious clubs, at that time, added not a little to the alarm taken by ob&s;erving and well-informed men. The writings and the
<PB N="21" REF="25">
clubs were two evils which marched toge|ther. Mr. Fox di&s;covered the greate&s;t po&s;|&s;ible di&s;po&s;ition to favour and countenance the one as well as the other of the&s;e two grand in&s;truments of the French &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;He would hardly con&s;ider any political writ|ing what&s;oever, as a libel, or as a fit object of pro&s;ecution. At a time in which the pre&s;s has been the grand in&s;trument of the &s;ubver&s;ion of order, of morals, of religion, and I may &s;ay of human &s;ociety it&s;elf, to carry the doctrines of its liberty higher than ever it has been known by its mo&s;t extrava|gant a&s;&s;ertors even in France, gave occa|&s;ion to very &s;erious reflections. Mr. Fox treated the a&s;&s;ociations for pro&s;ecuting the&s;e libels, as tending to prevent the improve|ment of the human mind, and as a mobbi&s;h tyranny. He thought proper to compare them with the riotous a&s;&s;emblies of Lord George Gordon in 1780, declaring that he had advi&s;ed his friends in We&s;tmin&s;ter, to &s;ign the a&s;&s;ociations whether they agreed to them or not, in order that they might avoid de&s;truction to their per&s;ons or their hou&s;es, or a de&s;ertion of their &s;hops. This
<PB N="22" REF="26">
in&s;idious advice tended to confound tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to the object of the a&s;&s;oci|ation, with the &s;editious, again&s;t whom the a&s;&s;ociation was directed. By this &s;tratagem, the confederacy intended for pre&s;erving the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and the public peace, would be wholly defeated. The magi&s;trates, utterly incapable of di&s;tingui&s;hing the friends from the enemies of order, would in vain look for &s;upport when they &s;tood in the greate&s;t need of it.</P>
<P N="13">13. Mr. Fox's whole conduct, on this occa&s;ion was without example. The very morning after the&s;e violent declamations in the Hou&s;e of Commons again&s;t the a&s;&s;oci|ation, (that is on Tue&s;day the 18th) he went him&s;elf to a meeting of St. George's pari&s;h, and there &s;igned an a&s;&s;ociation of the nature and tendency of tho&s;e he had the night before &s;o vehemently condemned; and &s;everal of his particular and mo&s;t intimate friends, inhabitants of that pari&s;h, attended and &s;igned along with him.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="23" REF="27">14. Immediately after this extraordinary &s;tep, and in order perfectly to defeat the ends of that a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t Jacobin pub|lications, (which, contrary to his opinions, he had promoted and &s;igned) a mi&s;chievous &s;ociety was formed under his au&s;pices, cal|led, the <HI>Friends of the Liberty of the Pre&s;s.</HI> Their title groundle&s;sly in&s;inuated, that the freedom of the pre&s;s had lately &s;uffered, or was now threatened with &s;ome violation.&mdash;This &s;ociety was only, in reality, another modification of the &s;ociety calling it&s;elf the <HI>Friends of the People,</HI> which, in the preced|ing &s;ummer had cau&s;ed &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s in the Duke of Portland's mind, and in the minds of &s;everal of his friends. This new &s;ociety was compo&s;ed of many, if not mo&s;t of the members of the club of the <HI>Friends of the People,</HI> with the addition of a va&s;t multitude of others (&s;uch as Mr. Horne Tooke) of the wor&s;t and mo&s;t &s;editious di&s;|po&s;itions that could be found in the whole kingdom. In the fir&s;t meeting of this club, Mr. Er&s;kine took the lead, and directly (with|out any di&s;avowal ever &s;ince on Mr. Fox's part) <HI>made u&s;e of his name and authority in</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="28">
<HI>favour of its formation and purpo&s;es.</HI> In the &s;ame meeting Mr. Er&s;kine had thanks for his defence of <HI>Paine,</HI> which amounted to a complete avowal of that Jacobin incendiary, el&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to know how Mr. Er&s;|kine &s;hould have de&s;erved &s;uch marked ap|plau&s;es for acting merely as a lawyer for his fee, in the ordinary cour&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="15">15. Indeed Mr. Fox appeared the general patron of all &s;uch per&s;ons and proceedings. When Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and other per&s;ons, for practices of the mo&s;t dangerous kind, in Paris and in London, were re|moved from the King's Guards, Mr. Fox took occa&s;ion, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, heavily to cen&s;ure that act as unju&s;t and op|pre&s;&s;ive, and tending to make officers bad citizens. There were few, however, who did not call for &s;ome &s;uch mea&s;ures on the part of Government, as of ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity for the King's per&s;onal &s;afety, as well as that of the public; and nothing but the mi&s;taken lenity (with which &s;uch practices were rather di&s;countenanced than puni&s;hed)
<PB N="25" REF="29">
could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve reprehen&s;ion in what was done with regard to tho&s;e gentlemen.</P>
<P N="16">16. Mr. Fox, regularly and &s;y&s;tematically, and with a diligence long unu&s;ual to him, did every thing he could to countenance the &s;ame principle of fraternity and connection with the Jacobins abroad, and the National Con|vention of France, for which the&s;e officers had been removed from the Guards. For when a bill (feeble and lax indeed, and far &s;hort of the vigour required by the conjunc|ture) was brought in for removing out of the kingdom the emi&s;&s;aries of France, Mr. Fox oppo&s;ed it with all his might. He pur|&s;ued a vehement and detailed oppo&s;iton to it through all its &s;tages, de&s;cribing it as a mea|&s;ure contrary to the exi&s;ting treaties between Great Britain and France; as a violation of the law of nations, and as an outrage on the great charter it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="17">17. In the &s;ame manner, and with the &s;ame heat, he oppo&s;ed a bill, which, (though aukward and artful in its con&s;truction) was right and wi&s;e in its principle, and was pre|cedented
<PB N="26" REF="30">
in the be&s;t times, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary at that juncture, I mean the Trai|torous Corre&s;pondence Bill. By the&s;e means the enemy, rendered infinitely dangerous by the links of real faction and pretended com|merce, would have been (had Mr. Fox &s;ucceeded) enabled to carry on the war again&s;t us by our own re&s;ources. For this purpo&s;e that enemy would have its agents and traitors in the mid&s;t of us.</P>
<P N="18">18. When at length war was actually de|clared, by the u&s;urpers in France, again&s;t this kingdom, and declared whil&s;t they were pretending a negociation through Dumou|rier with Lord Auckland, Mr. Fox &s;till con|tinued, through the whole of the proceed|ings, to di&s;credit the national honour and ju&s;tice, and to throw the entire blame of the war on Parliament and on his own country, as acting with violence, haughtine&s;s, and want of equity. He frequently a&s;&s;erted, both at the time and ever &s;ince, that the war, though declared by France, was pro|voked by us, and that it was wholly unnece&s;|&s;ary and fundamentally unju&s;t.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="27" REF="31">19. He has lo&s;t no opportunity of railing, in the mo&s;t virulent manner, and in the mo&s;t unmea&s;ured language, at every foreign power with whom we could now, or at any time, contract any u&s;eful or effectual alliance again&s;t France, declaring that he hoped no alliance with tho&s;e powers was made, or was in a train of being made.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is an exception, that in one of his la&s;t &s;peeches, (but not before) Mr. Fox &s;eemed to think, an alliance with Spain might be proper.</NOTE> He always ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t horror con|cerning &s;uch alliances, &s;o did all his pha|lanx. Mr. Sheridan, in particular, after one of his invectives again&s;t tho&s;e powers, &s;itting by him, &s;aid, with manife&s;t marks of his approbation, that if we mu&s;t go to war, he had rather go to war alone than with &s;uch allies.</P>
<P N="20">20. Immediately after the French decla|ration of war again&s;t us, Parliament addre&s;|&s;ed the King in &s;upport of the war again&s;t them, as ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, and provoked as well as formally declared again&s;t Great Bri|tain. He did not divide the Hou&s;e upon this
<PB N="28" REF="32">
mea&s;ure; yet he immediately followed this our &s;olemn Parliamentary engagement to the King, with a motion propo&s;ing a &s;et of re|&s;olutions, the effect of which was, that the two Hou&s;es were to load them&s;elves with every kind of reproach for having made the addre&s;s, which they had ju&s;t carried to the Throne. He commenced this long &s;tring of criminatory re&s;olutions again&s;t his country (if King, Lords and Commons of Great Bri|tain, and a decided majority without doors are his country) <HI>with a declaration again&s;t intermeddling in the interior concerns of France.</HI> The purport of this re&s;olution of non-inter|ference, is a thing unexampled in the hi&s;tory of the world, when one nation has been ac|tually at war with another. The be&s;t writers on the law of nations, give no &s;ort of coun|tenance to his doctrine of non-interference, in the extent and manner in which he u&s;ed it, <HI>even when there is no war.</HI> When the war exi&s;ts, not one authority is again&s;t it in all its latitude. His doctrine is equally contrary to the enemy's uniform practice, who, whether in peace or in war, makes it her great aim, not only to change the Go|vernment,
<PB N="29" REF="33" MS="y">
but to make an entire revolution in the whole of the &s;ocial order in every country.</P>
<P>The object of the la&s;t of this extraordinary &s;tring of re&s;olutions moved by Mr. Fox, was to advi&s;e the Crown not to enter into &s;uch an engagement with any foreign power, &s;o as to hinder us from making a <HI>&s;eparate</HI> peace with France, or which might tend to enable any of tho&s;e powers to introduce a govern|ment in that country, other than &s;uch as tho&s;e per&s;ons whom he calls the people of France, &s;hall choo&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;h. In &s;hort, the whole of the&s;e re&s;olutions appeared to have but one drift&mdash;namely, the &s;acrifice of our own dome&s;tic dignity and &s;afety, and the independency of Europe, to the &s;upport of this &s;trange mixture of anarchy and tyranny which prevails in France, and which Mr. Fox and his party were plea&s;ed to call a Government. The immediate con&s;equences of the&s;e mea&s;ures was (by an example, the ill effects of which, on the whole world, are not to be calculated) to &s;ecure the robbers of the innocent nobility, gentry, and eccle&s;i|a&s;tics
<PB N="30" REF="34" MS="y">
of France, the enjoyment of the &s;poil they have made of the e&s;tates, hou&s;es, and goods of their fellow-citizens.</P>
<P N="21">21. Not &s;atisfied with moving the&s;e re|&s;olutions, tending to confirm this horrible tyranny and robbery, and with actually divid|ing the Hou&s;e on the fir&s;t of the long &s;tring which they compo&s;ed, in a few days after|wards he encouraged and &s;upported Mr. Grey in producing the very &s;ame &s;trings in a new form, and in moving, under the &s;hape of an addre&s;s of Parliament to the Crown, another virulent libel on all its own proceed|ings in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, in which not only all the ground of the re&s;olutions was again travelled over, but much new inflammatory matter was introduced. In particular, a charge was made, that Great Britain had not interpo&s;ed to prevent the la&s;t partition of Poland. On this head the party dwelt very largely, and very vehemently. Mr. Fox's intention, in the choice of this extraordinary topic, was evident enough. He well knows two things; fir&s;t, that no wi&s;e or hone&s;t man can approve of that partition, and without progno&s;ticating
<PB N="31" REF="35">
great mi&s;chief from it to all countries at &s;ome future time. Secondly, he knows quite as well, that, let our opinions on that partition be what they will, England, by it&s;elf, is not in a &s;ituation to afford to Poland any a&s;&s;i&s;tance what&s;oever. The purpo&s;e of the introduc|tion of Poli&s;h politics into this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, was not for the &s;ake of Poland; it was to throw an odium upon tho&s;e who are obliged to de|cline the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice from their impo&s;&s;i|bility of &s;upporting a cau&s;e which they ap|prove, as if we, who think more &s;trongly on this &s;ubject than he does, were of a party again&s;t Poland, becau&s;e we are obliged to act with &s;ome of the authors of that inju&s;tice, again&s;t our common enemy, France. But the great and leading purpo&s;e of this intro|duction of Poland into the debates on the French war, was to divert the public atten|tion from what was in our power, that is, from a &s;teady co-operation again&s;t France, to a quarrel with the Allies for the &s;ake of a Poli&s;h war, which, for any u&s;eful purpo&s;e to. Poland, he knew it was out of our power to make. If England can touch Poland ever &s;o remotely, it mu&s;t be through the medium of
<PB N="32" REF="36">
alliances. But by attacking all the combined powers together for their &s;uppo&s;ed unju&s;t aggre&s;&s;ion upon France, he bound them by a new common intere&s;t, not &s;eparately to join England for the re&s;cue of Poland. The propo&s;ition could only mean to do what all the papers of his party in the Morning Chro|nicle have aimed at per&s;uading the public to, through the whole of the la&s;t autumn and winter, and to this hour; that is, to an alli|ance with the Jacobins of France, for the pretended purpo&s;e of &s;uccouring Poland. This curious project would leave to Great Britain no other Ally in all Europe, except its old enemy France.</P>
<P N="22">22. Mr. Fox, after the fir&s;t day's di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion on the que&s;tion for the addre&s;s, was at length driven to admit&mdash;(to admit rather than to urge, and that very faintly) that France had di&s;covered ambitious views, which none of his partizans, that I recollect, (Mr. Sheridan excepted) did, however, either urge or admit. What is remarkable enough, all the points admitted again&s;t the Jacobins, were brought to bear in their favour as much
<PB N="33" REF="37">
as tho&s;e in which they were defended. But when Mr. Fox admitted that the conduct of the Jacobins did di&s;cover ambition, he always ended his admi&s;&s;ion of their ambitious views by an apology for them, in&s;i&s;ting, that the univer&s;ally ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition &s;hewn to them, rendered their ambition a &s;ort of defen&s;ive policy. Thus, whatever road he travelled, they all terminated in recommending a re|cognition of their pretended Republic, and in the plan of &s;ending an amba&s;&s;ador to it. This was the burthen of all his &s;ong&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Every thing which we could rea&s;onably hope from war, would be obtained from treaty."</Q> It is to be ob&s;erved, however, that in all the&s;e debates, Mr. Fox never once &s;tated to the Hou&s;e upon what ground it was he conceived, that all the objects of the French &s;y&s;tem of united fanatici&s;m and ambition would in&s;tantly be given up whenever England &s;hould think fit to propo&s;e a treaty. On propo&s;ing &s;o &s;trange a recognition and &s;o humiliating an emba&s;&s;y as he moved, he was bound to pro|duce his authority, if any authority he had. He ought to have done this the rather, be|cau&s;e Le Brun, in his fir&s;t propo&s;itions, and
<PB N="34" REF="38">
in his an&s;wers to Lord Grenville, defended, <HI>on principle, not on temporary convenience,</HI> every thing which was objected to France, and &s;hewed not the &s;malle&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to give up any any one of the points in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Mr. Fox mu&s;t al&s;o have known, that the Convention had pa&s;&s;ed to the order of the day, on a propo&s;ition to give &s;ome &s;ort of explanation or modification to the ho&s;tile de|cree of the 19th of November, for exciting in&s;urrections in all countries; a decree known to be peculiarly pointed at Great Britain. The whole proceeding of the French admi|ni&s;tration was the mo&s;t remote that could be imagined from furni&s;hing any indication of a pacific di&s;po&s;ition: for at the very time in which it was pretended that the Jacobins entertained tho&s;e boa&s;ted pacific intentions, at the very time in which Mr. Fox was urg|ing a treaty with them, not content with re|fu&s;ing a modification of the decree for in&s;ur|rections, they publi&s;hed their ever memorable decree of the 15th of December, 1792, for di&s;organizing every country in Europe, into which they &s;hould on any occa&s;ion &s;et their foot; and on the 25th and the 30th of the
<PB N="35" REF="39" MS="y">
&s;ame month, they &s;olemnly, and on the la&s;t of the&s;e days, practically confirmed that de|cree.</P>
<P N="23">23. But Mr. Fox had him&s;elf taken good care in the negociation he propo&s;ed, that France &s;hould not be obliged to make any very great conce&s;&s;ions to her pre&s;umed mo|deration&mdash;for he had laid down one general comprehen&s;ive rule, with him (as he &s;aid) con&s;tant and inviolable. This rule, in fact, would not only have left to the faction in France, all the property and power they had u&s;urped at home, but mo&s;t, if not all, of the conque&s;ts which by their atrocious perfidy and violence, they had made abroad. The principal laid down by Mr. Fox, is this, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>That every &s;tate, in the conclu&s;ion of a war, has a right to avail it&s;elf of its conque&s;ts to|wards an indemnification.</HI>"</Q> This principle (true or fal&s;e) is totally contrary to the policy which this country has pur&s;ued with Fracce, at various periods, particularly at the treaty of Ry&s;wick, in the la&s;t century, and at the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in this, What|ever the merits of his rule may be, in the eyes of neutral judges, it is a rule, which no
<PB N="36" REF="40">
&s;tate&s;man before him ever laid down in fa|vour of the adver&s;e power with whom he was to negotiate. The adver&s;e party him&s;elf, may &s;afely be tru&s;ted to take care of his <HI>own</HI> aggrandi&s;ement. But (as if the black boxes of the &s;everal parties had been exchanged) Mr. Fox's Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, by &s;ome odd mi&s;take, would find him&s;elf charged with the concerns of France. If we were to leave France as &s;he &s;tood at the time when Mr. Fox propo&s;ed to treat with her, that formi|dable power mu&s;t have been infinitely &s;trengthened, and almo&s;t every other power in Europe as much weakened, by the extra|ordinary ba&s;is which he laid for a treaty. For Avignon mu&s;t go from the Pope; Savoy (at lea&s;t) from the King of Sardinia, if not Nice. Liege, Monk, Salm, Deux Ponts, and Bale, mu&s;t be &s;eparated from Germany. On this &s;ide of the Rhine, Liege, at lea&s;t, mu&s;t be lo&s;t to the empire, and added to France. Mr. Fox's general principle fully covered all this. How much of the&s;e territories came within his rule, he never attempted to define. He kept a profound &s;ilence as to Germany. As to the Netherlands he was &s;omething more
<PB N="37" REF="41" MS="y">
explicit. He &s;aid, (if I recollect right) that France, on that &s;ide, might expect &s;ome|thing towards &s;trengthening her frontier. As to the remaining parts of the Netherlands, which he &s;uppo&s;ed France might con&s;ent to &s;urrender, he declared, went &s;o far as that England ought not to permit the Emperor to be repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the remainder of the ten Provinces, but that <HI>the People</HI> &s;hould choo&s;e &s;uch a form of independent Government as they liked. This propo&s;ition of Mr. Fox was ju&s;t the arrangement which the u&s;urpa|tion in France had all along propo&s;ed to make. As the circum&s;tances were at that time, and have been ever &s;ince, his propo&s;ition fully indicated what Government the Flem|ings <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have in the &s;tated extent of what was left to them. A Government &s;o &s;et up in the Netherlands, whether compul&s;ory, or by the choice of the Sans Culottes, (who he well knew were to be the real electors, and the &s;ole electors) in whatever name it was to exi&s;t, mu&s;t evidently depend for its exi&s;t|ence, as it has done for its original forma|tion, on France. In reality, it mu&s;t have ended in that point, to which, piece by
<PB N="38" REF="42">
piece, the French were then actually bring|ing all the Netherlands; that is, an incor|poration with France, as a body of new departments, ju&s;t as Savoy and Liege, and the re&s;t of their pretended independent po|pular &s;overeignties, have been united to their republic. Such an arrangement mu&s;t have de&s;troyed Au&s;tria; it mu&s;t have left Holland always at the mercy of France; it mu&s;t totally and for ever cut off all political communication between England and the Continent. Such mu&s;t have been the &s;itua|tion of Europe, according to Mr. Fox's &s;y&s;tem of politics, however laudable his per&s;onal motives may have been in propo&s;ing &s;o compleat a change in the whole &s;y&s;tem of Great Britain, with regard to all the Continental powers.</P>
<P N="24">24. After it had been generally &s;uppo&s;ed that all public bu&s;ine&s;s was over for the &s;e&s;|&s;ion, and that Mr. Fox had exhau&s;ted all the modes of pre&s;&s;ing this French &s;cheme, he thought proper to take a &s;tep beyond every expectation, and which demon&s;trated his wonderful eagerne&s;s and per&s;everance in
<PB N="39" REF="43" MS="y">
his cau&s;e, as well as the nature and true character of the cau&s;e it&s;elf. This &s;tep was taken by Mr. Fox immediately after his giv|ing his a&s;&s;ent to the Grant of Supply voted to him by Mr. Serjeant Adair and a Com|mittee of Gentlemen, who a&s;&s;umed to them|&s;elves to act in the name of the public. In the in&s;trument of his acceptance of this Grant, Mr. Fox took occa&s;ion to a&s;&s;ure them, that he would always per&s;evere <HI>in the &s;ame conduct</HI> which had procured to him &s;o honourable a mark of the public approba|tion. He was as good as his word.</P>
<P N="25">25. It was not long before an opportu|nity was found, or made, for proving the &s;incerity of his profe&s;&s;ions, and demon&s;trat|ing his gratitude to tho&s;e who had given public and unequivocal marks of their ap|probation of his late conduct. One of the mo&s;t virulent of the Jacobin Faction, Mr. Gurney, a banker at Norwich, had all along di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his French politics. By the means of this Gentleman, and of his a&s;&s;ociates of the &s;ame de&s;cription, one of the mo&s;t in&s;idious and dangerous
<PB N="40" REF="44">
hand-bills that ever was &s;een, had been cir|culated at Norwich again&s;t the war, drawn up in an hypocritical tone of compa&s;&s;ion for the Poor. This Addre&s;s to the Populace of Norwich was to play in concert with an Ad|dre&s;s to Mr. Fox; was &s;igned by Mr. Gurney and the higher part of the French Fraternity in that town. In this paper Mr. Fox is applauded for his Conduct throughout the &s;e&s;&s;ion; and reque&s;ted, be|fore the prorogation, to make a motion for an immediate Peace with France.</P>
<P N="26">26. Mr. Fox did not revoke to this &s;uit: he readily and thankfully undertook the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned to him. Not content, however, with merely falling in with their wi&s;hes, he propo&s;ed a ta&s;k on his part to the Gentle|men of Norwich, which was, <HI>that they &s;hould move the people without doors to petition again&s;t the War.</HI> He &s;aid, that without &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, little good could be ex|pected from any thing he might attempt within the walls of the Hou&s;e of Commons. In the mean time, to animate his Norwich friends in their endeavours to be&s;iege Parlia|ment,
<PB N="41" REF="45">
he &s;natched the fir&s;t opportunity to give notice of a motion, which he very &s;oon after made, namely, to addre&s;s the Crown to make Peace with France. The Addre&s;s was &s;o worded as to co-operate with the hand-bill in bringing forward matter calcu|lated to inflame the manufacturers through|out the kingdom.</P>
<P N="27">27. In &s;upport of his motion, he de|claimed in the mo&s;t virulent &s;train, even beyond any of his former invectives, again&s;t every power with whom we were then, and are now, acting again&s;t France. In the <HI>moral</HI> forum, &s;ome of the&s;e powers certainly de&s;erve all the ill he &s;aid of them; but the <HI>political</HI> effect aimed at, evidently was to turn our indignation from France, with whom we were at war, upon Ru&s;&s;ia, or Pru&s;&s;ia, or Au&s;tria, or Sardinia, or all of them together. In con&s;equence of his knowledge that we <HI>could</HI> not effectually do <HI>without</HI> them, and his re&s;olution that we <HI>&s;hould</HI> not act <HI>with</HI> them, he therefore pro|po&s;ed, that having, as he a&s;&s;erted,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ob|tained the only avowed object of the
<PB N="42" REF="46">
War (the evacuation of Holland); we ought to conclude an in&s;tant Peace."</Q></P>
<P N="28">28. Mr. Fox could not be ignorant of the mi&s;taken ba&s;is upon which his motion was grounded. He was not ignorant, that, though the attempt of Dumourier on Hol|land (&s;o very near &s;ucceeding), and the na|vigation of the Scheld (a part of the &s;ame piece), were among the <HI>immediate</HI> cau&s;es, they were by no means the only cau&s;es alledged for Parliament's taking that offence at the proceedings of France, for which the Jacobins were &s;o prompt in declaring war upon this kingdom. Other full as weighty cau&s;es had been alledged: They were, 1. The general overbearing and de&s;perate am|bition of that Faction. 2. Their actual at|tacks on every nation in Europe. 3. Their u&s;urpation of territories in the empire with the governments of which they had no pre|tence of quarrel. 4. Their perpetual and irrevocable con&s;olidation with their own do|minions of every territory of the Nether|lands, of Germany, and of Italy, of which they got a temporary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. 5. The mi&s;chiefs attending the prevalence of their
<PB N="43" REF="47">
&s;y&s;tem, which would make the &s;ucce&s;s of their ambitious de&s;igns a new and peculiar &s;pecies of calamity in the world. 6. Their formal public decrees; particularly tho&s;e of the 9th of November, and 15th and 25th of December. 7. Their notorious attempts to undermine the Con&s;titution of this coun|try. 8. Their public reception of deputa|tions or traitors for that direct purpo&s;e. 9. Their murder of their Sovereign, declared by mo&s;t of the members of the Convention, who &s;poke with their vote (without a di&s;|avowal from any) to be perpetrated, as an example to <HI>all</HI> Kings, and a pre&s;ident for <HI>all</HI> &s;ubjects to follow. All the&s;e, and not the Scheld alone, or the inva&s;ion of Holland were urged by the Mini&s;ter, and by Mr. Wyndham, by my&s;elf, and by others who &s;poke in tho&s;e debates, as cau&s;es for bring|ing France to a &s;en&s;e of her wrong in the war which &s;he declared again&s;t us. Mr. Fox well knew, that not one man argued for the nece&s;&s;ity of a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance to France, who did not &s;tate the war as being for the very exi&s;tence of the &s;ocial order here, and every part of Europe; who did
<PB N="44" REF="48">
not &s;tate his opinion, that this war was not at all a foreign War of Empire, but as much for our Liberties, Properties, Laws, and Religion; and even more &s;o than any we had ever been engaged in. This was the war, which, according to Mr. Fox and Mr. Gurney, we were to abandon, before the enemy had felt, in the &s;lighte&s;t degree, the impre&s;&s;ion of our arms.</P>
<P N="29">29. Had Mr. Fox's di&s;graceful propo&s;al been complied with, this kingdom would have been &s;tained with a blot of perfidy hi|therto without an example in our hi&s;tory, and with far le&s;s excu&s;e than any act of per|fidy which we find in the hi&s;tory of any other nation. The moment, when by the incredible exertions of Au&s;tria (very little through our's) the temporary deliverance of Holland (in effect our own deliverance) had been atchieved, he advi&s;ed the Hou&s;e in|&s;tantly to abandon her to that very enemy, from who&s;e arms &s;he had freed our&s;elves, and the clo&s;e&s;t of our allies.</P>
<P N="30"><PB N="45" REF="49">30. But we are not to be impo&s;ed on by forms of language. We mu&s;t act on the &s;ub|&s;tance of things. To abandon Au&s;tria in this manner, was to abandon Holland it&s;elf. For &s;uppo&s;e France, encouraged and &s;trengthen|ed as &s;he mu&s;t have been by our treacherous de&s;ertion, &s;uppo&s;e France, I &s;ay, to &s;ucceed again&s;t Au&s;tria, (as &s;he had &s;ucceeded the very year before) England would, after its di&s;|armament, have nothing in the world but the inviolable faith of Jacobini&s;m, and the &s;teady politics of anarchy to depend upon, again&s;t France's renewing the very &s;ame attempts upon Holland, and renewing them (con&s;ider|ing what Holland was and is) with much bet|ter pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s. Mr. Fox mu&s;t have been well aware, that if we were to break with the greater Continental Powers, and par|ticularly to come to a rupture with them, in the violent and intemperate mode in which he would have made the breach, the defence of Holland again&s;t a foreign enemy, and a &s;trong dome&s;tic faction, mu&s;t hereafter re&s;t &s;olely upon England, without the chance of a &s;ingle Ally, either on that or on any other
<PB N="46" REF="50">
occa&s;ion. So far as to the pretended &s;ole ob|ject of the war, which Mr. Fox &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o completely obtained, but which then was not at all, and at this day is not com|pletely obtained, as to leave us nothing el&s;e to do than to cultivate a peaceful, quiet cor|re&s;pondence with tho&s;e quiet, peaceable and moderate people, the Jacobins of France.</P>
<P N="31">31. To induce us to this, Mr. Fox labour|ed hard to make it appear, that the powers with whom we acted, were full as ambitious and as perfidious as the French. This might be true as to <HI>other</HI> nations. They had not, however, been &s;o to <HI>Us</HI> or to Holland. He produced no proof of active ambition and ill faith again&s;t Au&s;tria. But &s;uppo&s;ing the com|bined Powers had been all thus faithle&s;s, and had been all alike &s;o, there was one circum|&s;tance which made an e&s;&s;ential difference be|tween them and France. I need not be at the trouble of conte&s;ting this point, (which, however, in this latitude, and as at all affecting Great Britain and Holland, I deny utterly). Be it &s;o. But the great Monarchies have it
<PB N="47" REF="51">
in their power to keep their faith <HI>if they plea&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e they are Governments of e&s;tabli&s;hed and recognized authority at home and abroad. France had, in reality, no Government. The very factions who exerci&s;ed power, had no &s;tability. The French Convention had no powers of peace or war. Suppo&s;ing the Con|vention to be free (mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly it was not) they had &s;hewn no di&s;po&s;ition to abandon their projects.&mdash;Though long driven out of Liege, it was not many days before Mr. Fox's mo|tion, that they &s;till continued to claim it as a country, which their principles of fraternity bound them to protect, that is, to &s;ubdue and to regulate at their plea&s;ure. That party which Mr. Fox inclined mo&s;t to favour and tru&s;t, and from which he mu&s;t have received his a&s;&s;urances (if any he did receive) that is the <HI>Bri&s;&s;otins,</HI> were then either pri&s;oners or fugitives. The Party which prevailed over them (that of Danton and Marat) was it&s;elf in a tottering condition, and was di&s;owned by a very great part of France. To &s;ay nothing of the Royal Party who were powerful and growing, and who had full as good a right to
<PB N="48" REF="52">
claim to be the legitimate Government as any of the Pari&s;ian Factions with whom he pro|po&s;ed to treat&mdash;or rather (as it &s;eemed to me) to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P N="32">32. But when Mr. Fox began to come from his general hopes of the moderation of the Jacobins, to particulars, he put the ca&s;e, that they might not perhaps be willing to &s;urren|der Savoy. He certainly was not willing to conte&s;t that point with them; but plainly and explicitly (as I under&s;tood him) propo&s;ed to let them keep it; though he knew (or he was much wor&s;e informed than he would be thought) that England had, at the very time, agreed on the terms of a Treaty with the King of Sardinia, of which the recovery of Savoy was the <HI>Ca&s;us Federis.</HI> In the teeth of of this Treaty, Mr. Fox propo&s;ed a direct and mo&s;t &s;candalous breach of our faith, for|mally and recently given. But to &s;urrender Savoy, was to &s;urrender a great deal more than &s;o many &s;quare acres of land, or &s;o much revenue. In its con&s;equences, the &s;urrender of Savoy, was to make a &s;urrender to France
<PB N="49" REF="53">
of Switzerland and Italy, of both which countries, Savoy is the key&mdash;as it is known to ordinary &s;peculators in politics, though it may not be known to the Weavers in Nor|wich, who, it &s;eems are, by Mr. Fox, called to be the judges in this matter.</P>
<P N="33">33. A &s;ure way indeed, to encourage France not to make a &s;urrender of this key of Italy and Switzerland, or of Mayence, the key of Germany, or of any other object what&s;oever which &s;he holds, is to let her &s;ee, <HI>that the People of England rai&s;e a clamour again&s;t the War before terms are &s;o much as propo&s;ed on any &s;ide.</HI> From that moment, the Jacobins would be ma&s;ters of the terms.&mdash;They would know, that Parliament, at all hazards, would force the King to a &s;eparate Peace. The Crown could not, in that ca&s;e, have any u&s;e of its judgment. Parliament could not po&s;&s;e&s;s more judgment than the Crown, when be&s;ieged (as Mr. Fox propo&s;ed to Mr. Gurney) by the cries of the Manufac|turers. This de&s;cription of men, Mr. Fox endeavoured in his &s;peech, by every method,
<PB N="50" REF="54">
to irritate and inflame. In effect, his two &s;peeches were, through the whole, nothing more than an amplification of the Norwich Hand-bill. He re&s;ted the greate&s;t part of his argument on the di&s;tre&s;s of Trade, which he attributed to the war, though it was obvious, to any tolerably good ob&s;ervation, and much more mu&s;t have been clear to &s;uch an ob&s;er|vation as his, that the then difficulties of the Trade and Manufacture could have no &s;ort of connection with our &s;hare in it. The war had hardly begun. We had &s;uffered neither by &s;poil, nor by defeat, nor by di&s;grace of any kind. Public credit was &s;o little impaired, that in&s;tead of being &s;upported by any extra|ordinary aids from individuals, it advanced a credit to individuals to the amount of five millions, for the &s;upport of Trade and Manu|factures, under their temporary difficulties, a thing before never heard of;&mdash;a thing of which I do not commend the policy&mdash;but only &s;tate it, to &s;hew, that Mr. Fox's ideas of the effects of war were without any trace of foun|dation.</P>
<P N="33"><PB N="51" REF="55">33. It is impo&s;&s;ible not to connect the ar|guments and proceedings of a Party with that of its leader&mdash;e&s;pecially when not di&s;avowed or controlled by him. Mr. Fox's partizans de|claim again&s;t all the powers of Europe, except the Jacobins, ju&s;t as he does; but not having the &s;ame rea&s;ons for management and caution which he has, they &s;peak out. He &s;atisfies him&s;elf merely with making his invectives, and leaves others to draw the conclu&s;ion. But they produce their Poli&s;h interpo&s;ition, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of leading to a French alliance. They urge their French Peace, in order to make a junction with the Jacobins to oppo&s;e the powers, whom, in their lan|guage, they call De&s;pots, and their leagues, a combination of De&s;pots. Indeed, no man can look on the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of Europe with the lea&s;t degree of di&s;cernment, who will not be thoroughly convinced, that Eng|land mu&s;t be the fa&s;t friend or the determined enemy of France. There is no medium; and I do not think Mr. Fox to be &s;o dull as not to ob&s;erve this. His Peace would in|volve us in&s;tantly in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and
<PB N="52" REF="56">
mo&s;t ruinous wars; at the &s;ame time that it would have made a broad highway (acro&s;s which no human wi&s;dom could put an ef|fectual barrier) for a mutual intercour&s;e with the fraternizing Jacobins on both &s;ides. The con&s;equences of which, tho&s;e will certainly not provide again&s;t, who do not dread or di&s;|like them.</P>
<P N="34">34. It is not ami&s;s in this place to enter a little more fully into the &s;pirit of the principal arguments on which Mr. Fox thought proper to re&s;t this his grand and concluding motion, particularly &s;uch as were drawn from the in|ternal &s;tate of our affairs. Under a &s;pecious appearance (not uncommonly put on by men of un&s;crupulous ambition) that of tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion to the Poor; he did his be&s;t to appeal to the judgments of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t ignorant of the people on the merits of the War. He had before done &s;omething of the &s;ame dangerous kind in his printed Letter. The ground of a political War is of all things that which the poor labourer and manufactu|rer are the lea&s;t capable of conceiving. This
<PB N="53" REF="57">
&s;ort of people know in general that they mu&s;t &s;uffer by War. It is a matter to which they are &s;ufficiently competent, becau&s;e it is a matter of feeling. The <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of a War are not matters of feeling, but of rea&s;on and fore|&s;ight, and often of remote con&s;iderations, and of a very great combination of circum&s;tances, which <HI>they</HI> are utterly incapable of compre|hending; and, indeed, it is not every man in the highe&s;t cla&s;&s;es who is altogether equal to it. Nothing, in a general &s;en&s;e, appears to me le&s;s fair and ju&s;tifiable, (even if no attempt were made to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions) than to &s;ubmit a matter on di&s;cu&s;&s;ion to a Tribunal in|capable of judging of more than <HI>one &s;ide</HI> of the que&s;tion. It is at lea&s;t as unju&s;tifiable to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions of &s;uch Judges again&s;t <HI>that &s;ide,</HI> in favor of which they cannot &s;o much as comprehend the arguments. Before the pre|valence of the French Sy&s;tem (which as far as it has gone has extingui&s;hed the &s;alutary prejudice called our Country) nobody was more &s;en&s;ible of this important truth than Mr. Fox; and nothing was more proper and pertinent, or was more felt at the time, than
<PB N="54" REF="58">
his reprimand to Mr. Wilberforce for an in|con&s;iderate expre&s;&s;ion which tended to call in the judgment of the poor, to e&s;timate the policy of war upon the &s;tandard of the taxes they may be obliged to pay towards its &s;upport.</P>
<P N="35">35. It is fatally known, that the great Object of the Jacobin Sy&s;tem is to excite the lowe&s;t de&s;cription of the People to range them&s;elves under ambitious men, for the pil|lage and de&s;truction of the more eminent orders and cla&s;&s;es of the community. The thing, therefore, that a man not fanatically at|tached to that dreadful project, would mo&s;t &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid, is, to act a part with the French <HI>Propagandi&s;ts,</HI> in attributing (as they con&s;tantly do) all Wars and all the con&s;e|quences of Wars, to the pride of tho&s;e orders, and to their contempt of the weak and indi|gent part of the &s;ociety. The ruling Jaco|bins in&s;i&s;t upon it, that even the Wars which they carry on with &s;o much ob&s;tinacy again&s;t all Nations, are made to prevent the Poor from any longer being the in&s;truments and
<PB N="55" REF="59">
victims of Kings, Nobles, and the Ari&s;|tocracy of Burghers and Rich Men. They pretend that the de&s;truction of Kings, Nobles, and the Ari&s;tocracy of Burghers and Rich Men, is the only means of e&s;tabli&s;hing an univer|&s;al and perpetual Peace. This is the great drift of all their writings from the time of the meeting of the States of France, in 1789, to the publication of the la&s;t Morning Chro|nicle. They in&s;i&s;t that even the War which, with &s;o much boldne&s;s, they have declared again&s;t all Nations, is to prevent the poor from becoming the In&s;truments and Victims of the&s;e per&s;ons and de&s;criptions. It is but too ea&s;y, if you once teach poor labourers and mechanics to defy their prejudices, and as this has been done with an indu&s;try &s;carce|ly credible, to &s;ub&s;titute the principles of fraternity in the coom of that &s;alutary pre|judice called our Country, it is, I &s;ay, but too ea&s;y to per&s;uade them agreeably to what Mr. Fox hints in his public Letter, that this War is, and that the other Wars have been, the Wars of Kings; it is ea&s;y to per|&s;uade them that the terrors even of a
<PB N="56" REF="60">
foreign conque&s;t are not terrors for <HI>them</HI>&mdash;It is ea&s;y to per&s;uade them that, for their part, <HI>they</HI> have nothing to lo&s;e; and that their condition is not likely to be altered for the wor&s;e, whatever party may happen to prevail in the War. Under any circum|&s;tances this doctrine is highly dangerous, as it tends to make &s;eperate parties of the higher and lower orders, and to put their intere&s;ts on a different bottom. But if the enemy you have to deal with &s;hould ap|pear, as France now appears, under the very name and title of the deliverer of the poor, and the cha&s;ti&s;er of the rich, the former cla&s;s would readily become, not an indifferent &s;pectator of the War, but would be ready to enli&s;t in the faction of the enemy; which they would con&s;ider, tho' under a foreign name, to be more connected with them than an adver&s;e de&s;cription in the &s;ame land. All the props of Society would be drawn from us by the&s;e doctrines, and the very foundations of the public defence would give way in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P N="36"><PB N="57" REF="61">36. There is no point which the Faction of Fraternity in England have laboured more than to excite in the Poor the horror of any War with France upon any occa&s;ion. When they found that their open attacks upon our Con&s;titution in favor of a French Republic were for the pre&s;ent repelled&mdash;they put that matter out of &s;ight, and have taken up the more plau&s;ible and popular ground of general peace, upon merely general prin|ciples, altho' the&s;e very men in the corre|&s;pondence of their clubs with tho&s;e of France, had reprobated the neutrality which now they &s;o earne&s;tly pre&s;s. But, in reality, their max|im was and is <Q REND="inline">"Peace and Alliance with France, and War with the re&s;t of the World."</Q></P>
<P N="37">37. This la&s;t motion of Mr. Fox bound up the whole of his politics during the &s;e&s;&s;ions. This motive had many circum|&s;tances, particularly in the Norwich Cor|re&s;pondence, by which the mi&s;chief, of all the others, was aggravated beyond mea&s;ure. Yet, this la&s;t motion, far the wor&s;t of Mr.
<PB N="58" REF="62">
Fox's proceedings, was the be&s;t &s;upported of any of them, except his amendment to the Addre&s;s. The Duke of Portland had di|rectly engaged to &s;upport the War&mdash;Here was a motion as directly made to force the Crown to put an end to it before a blow had been &s;truck. The efforts of the Faction have &s;o prevailed that &s;ome of his Grace's neare&s;t friends have actually voted for that motion: &s;ome, after &s;hewing them&s;elves, went away&mdash;Others did not appear at all. So it mu&s;t be where a man is for any time &s;upported from per&s;onal con&s;iderations, with|out reference to his public conduct. Thro' the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s, the &s;pirit of fra|ternity appears to me to have been the governing principle. It might be &s;hameful for any man, above the vulgar, to &s;hew &s;o blind a partiality even to his own Country, as Mr. Fox appears, on all occa&s;ions, this Se&s;&s;ion, to have &s;hewn to France. Had Mr. Fox been a Mini&s;ter, and proceeded on the principles laid down by him, I believe there is little doubt he would have been con&s;ider|ed as the mo&s;t criminal State&s;man that ever
<PB N="59" REF="63" MS="y">
lived in this Country. I do not know why a State&s;man out of place is not to be judged in the &s;ame manner, unle&s;s we can excu&s;e him by pleading in his favor a total indif|ference to principle; and that he would act and think in quite a different way if he were in office. This I will not &s;uppo&s;e. One may think better of him; and that in ca&s;e of his power he might change his mind. But &s;uppo&s;ing, that from better or from wor&s;e motives, he might change his mind on his acqui&s;ition of the favor of the Crown, I &s;eriou&s;ly fear that if the King &s;hould to|morrow put power into his hands, and that his good genius would in&s;pire him with maxims very different from tho&s;e he has promulgated, he would not be able to get the better of the ill temper, and the ill doc|trines he has been the means of exciting and propagating throughout the kingdom. From the very beginning of their inhuman and unprovoked rebellion and tyrannic u&s;urpa|tion, he has covered the predominant Faction in France, and their adherents here, with the mo&s;t exaggerated panegyrics; neither
<PB N="60" REF="64">
has he mi&s;&s;ed a &s;ingle opportunity of abu&s;ing and villifying tho&s;e, who in uniform con|currence with the Duke of Portland's and Lord Fitzwilliam's opinion, have maintain|ed the true grounds of the Revolution Set|tlement in 1688. He lamented all the defeats of the French; he rejoiced in all their victories; even when the&s;e victories threatened to overwhelm the Continent of Europe, and by facilitating their means of penetrating into Holland, to bring this mo&s;t dreadful of all evils with irre&s;i&s;tible force to the very doors, if not into the very heart, of our Country. To this hour he always &s;peaks of every thought of overturning the French Jacobini&s;m by force, on the part of any Power what&s;oever, as an attempt unju&s;t and cruel, and which he reprobates with horror. If any of the French Jacobin lead|ers are &s;poken of with hatred or &s;corn, he falls upon tho&s;e who take that liberty, with all the zeal and warmth with which men of honor defend their particular and bo&s;om friends, when attacked. He always repre|&s;ents their cau&s;e as a cau&s;e of Liberty; and
<PB N="61" REF="65">
all who oppo&s;e it as partizans of de&s;poti&s;m. He ob&s;tinately continues to con&s;ider the great and growing vices, crimes and di&s;|orders of that country, as only evils of pa&s;&s;age, which are to produce a permanent|ly happy &s;tate of order and freedom. He repre&s;ents the&s;e di&s;orders exactly in the &s;ame way, and with the &s;ame limitations which are u&s;ed by one of the two great Jacobin Factions, I mean that of PETION and BRISSOT. Like them he &s;tudiou&s;ly con|fines his horror and reprobation only to the ma&s;&s;acres of the &s;econd of September, and pa&s;&s;es by tho&s;e of the 10th of Augu&s;t, as well as the impri&s;onment and depo&s;ition of the King, which were the con&s;equences of that day, as indeed were the ma&s;&s;acres them|&s;elves to which he confines his cen&s;ure, tho' they were not actually perpetrated un|til early in September. Like that Faction, he condemns, not the depo&s;ition, or the pro|po&s;ed exile, or perpetual impri&s;onment, but only the murder of the King. Mr. SHERI|DAN on every occa&s;ion, palliates all their ma&s;&s;acres committed in every part of France,
<PB N="62" REF="66">
as the effects of a natural indignation at the exorbitances of de&s;poti&s;m, and of the dread of the people of returning under that yoke&mdash;He has thus taken occa&s;ion to load, not the actors in this wickedne&s;s, but the Government of a mild, merciful, benefi|cent and patriotic Prince, and his &s;uffering, faithful &s;ubjects, with all the crimes of the new anarchical tyranny, under which the one has been murdered, and the others are oppre&s;&s;ed. Tho&s;e continual either prai&s;es or palliating apologies of every thing done in France, and tho&s;e invectives as uni|formly vomited out upon all tho&s;e who ven|ture to expre&s;s their di&s;approbation of &s;uch proceedings, coming from a man of Mr. Fox's fame and authority, and one who is con&s;idered as the per&s;on to whom a great party of the wealthie&s;t men of the Kingdom look up, has been the cau&s;e why the principle of French fraternity formerly gained the ground which it had obtained. It will infallibly recover it&s;elf again, and in ten times a greater degree, if the kind of Peace, in the manner which he preaches, ever &s;hall
<PB N="63" REF="67">
be e&s;tabli&s;hed with the reigning faction in France.</P>
<P N="38">38. So far as to the French practices with regard to France and the other Powers of Europe&mdash;as to their principles and doctrines, with regard to the Con&s;titution of States, Mr. Fox &s;tudiou&s;ly, on all occa&s;ions, and indeed when no occa&s;ion calls for it, (as on the Debate of the petition for Reform) brings forward and a&s;&s;erts their fundamental and fatal principle, pregnant with every mi&s;|chief and every crime, namely that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in every Country the People is the legiti|mate Sovereign,"</Q> exactly conformable to the Declaration of the French Clubs and Legi&s;lators.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"La Souverainet&eacute; e&s;t <HI>une, in|divi&s;ible, inalienable, et impre&s;criptible.</HI> Elle appartient a la Nation. Aucune <HI>Section</HI> du peuple, ni aucun <HI>Individu</HI> ne peut s'en attribuer l'exerci&s;e."</Q>
It confounds, in a manner equally mi&s;chievous and &s;tupid, the origin of a Government from the people with its continuance in their hands. I believe, that no &s;uch doctrine has ever been heard
<PB N="64" REF="68" MS="y">
of in any public act of any Government what&s;oever, until it was adopted (I think from the writings of Rou&s;&s;eau) by the French A&s;&s;emblies, who have made it the ba&s;is of their Con&s;titution at home, and of the mat|ter of their apo&s;tate in every country. The&s;e and other wild declarations of ab&s;tract principle, Mr. Fox &s;ays, are in them&s;elves perfectly right and true; tho' in &s;ome ca&s;es he allows the French draw ab&s;urd con&s;e|quences from them. But I conceive he is mi&s;taken. The con&s;equences are mo&s;t lo|gically, though mo&s;t mi&s;chieviou&s;ly drawn from the premi&s;es and principles by that wicked and ungracious faction. The fault is in the foundation.</P>
<P N="39">39. Before &s;ociety, in a multitude of men, it is obvious, that &s;overeignty and &s;ub|jection are ideas which cannot exi&s;t. It is the compact on which &s;ociety is formed that makes both. But to &s;uppo&s;e the people, contrary to their compacts, both to give away and retain the &s;ame thing, is altogether ab|&s;urd. It is wor&s;e, for it &s;uppo&s;es in &s;ome

things combination of men a power and right of always di&s;&s;olving the &s;ocial union; which power, however, if it exi&s;ts, renders them again as little &s;overeigns as &s;ubjects, but a mere unconnected multitude. It is not ea&s;y to &s;tate for what good end, at a time like this, when the foundations of all antient and pre|&s;umptive Governments, &s;uch as ours (to which people &s;ubmit, not becau&s;e they have cho&s;en them, but becau&s;e they are born to them) are undermined by perilous theories, that Mr. Fox &s;hould be &s;o fond of referring to tho&s;e theories, upon all occa&s;ions, even tho' &s;peculatively they might be true, which God forbid they &s;hould! Particularly I do not &s;ee the rea&s;on why he &s;hould be &s;o fond of declaring, that the principles of the Re|volution have made the Crown of Great Britain <HI>elective</HI>; why he thinks it &s;ea&s;onable to preach up with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s, for now three years together, the doctrine of re&s;i&s;tence and Revolution at all; or to a&s;&s;ert that our la&s;t Revolution of 1688 &s;tands on the &s;ame or &s;imilar principles with that of France. We are not called upon to bring
<PB N="66" REF="70">
forward the&s;e doctrines, which are hardly ever re&s;orted to but in ca&s;es of extremity, and where they are followed by corre&s;pon|dent actions. We are not called upon by any circum&s;tance, that I know of, which can ju&s;tify a revolt; or which demands a Revolution, or can make an election of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the Crown nece&s;&s;ary, what ever latent right may be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t for effectuating any of the&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P N="40">40. Not the lea&s;t alarming of the proceed|ings of Mr. Fox and his friends in this Se&s;&s;i|on, e&s;pecially taken in concurrence with their whole proceedings, with regard to France and its principles, is their eagerne&s;s at this Sea&s;on, under pretence of Parliamentry Reforms (a project which had been for &s;ome time rather dormant) to di&s;credit and di&s;grace the Hou&s;e of Commons. For this purpo&s;e the&s;e Gen|tlemen had found a way to in&s;ult the Hou&s;e by &s;everal atrocious libels, in the form of petitions. In particular they brought up a libel, or rather a complete dige&s;t of libellous matter, from the Club called the
<PB N="67" REF="71">
Friends of the People. It is indeed at once the mo&s;t audacious and the mo&s;t in&s;idious of all the performances of that kind which have yet appeared. It is &s;aid to be the penman&s;hip of Mr. Tierney, to bring whom into Parliament the Duke of Portland for|merly had taken a good deal of pains, and expended, as I hear, a con&s;iderable &s;um of money,</P>
<P N="41">41. Among the circum&s;tances of danger from that piece and from its precedent, it is ob&s;ervable that this is the fir&s;t petition (if I remember right) <HI>coming from a Club or A&s;&s;ociation, &s;igned by Individuals, denoting neither local re&s;idence, nor corporate capacity.</HI> This mode of petition, not being &s;trictly illegal or informal, tho' in its &s;pirit in the highe&s;t degree mi&s;chievous, may and will lead to other things of that nature, tend|ing to bring the&s;e Clubs and A&s;&s;ociations to the French model, and to make them in the end an&s;wer French purpo&s;es: I mean, that without legal names, the&s;e Clubs will be lead to a&s;&s;ume political capacities; that
<PB N="68" REF="72">
they may debate the forms of Con&s;titution; and that from their Meetings they may in|&s;olently dictate their will to the regular au|thorities of the Kingdom, in the manner in which the Jacobin Clubs i&s;&s;ue their mandates to the National A&s;&s;embly or the National Convention. The audacious remon&s;trance, which I ob&s;erve is &s;igned by all of that A&s;&s;ociation (the Friends of the People) <HI>who are not in Parliament,</HI> and it was &s;upported mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly by all A&s;&s;oci|ations <HI>who are Members,</HI> with Mr. Fox at their head. He and they contended for refer|ring this libel to a committee. Upon the que&s;tion of that reference, they grounded all their debate for a change in the Con|&s;titution of Parliament. The pretended Petition is, in fact, a regular charge or im|peachment of the Hou&s;e of Commons, di|ge&s;ted into a number of Articles. This plan of reform is not a criminal Impeach|ment, but a matter of prudence, to be &s;ub|mitted to the public wi&s;dom, which mu&s;t be as well appri&s;ed of the facts as petition|ers can be. But tho&s;e acce&s;&s;ors of the
<PB N="69" REF="73">
Hou&s;e of Commons have proceeded upon the principles of a criminal proce&s;s; and have had the effrontry to offer proof on each Article.</P>
<P N="42">42. This charge, the party of Mr. Fox maintained article by article, beginning with the fir&s;t; namely, the interference of Peers at Elections, and their nominating in effect &s;everal of the Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons. In the printed li&s;t of grievan|ces which they made out on the occa&s;ion, and in &s;upport of their charge, is found the Borough, which under Lord Fitzwilliam's influence, I now &s;it. By this Remon|&s;trance and its object, they hope to defeat the operation of property in Elections, and in reality to di&s;&s;olve the connection and communication of intere&s;ts, which makes the Hou&s;es of Parliament a mutual &s;upport to each other. Mr. Fox and the Friends of the People are not &s;o ignorant as not to know, that Peers do not interfere in Elec|tions as Peers, but as men of property&mdash;They well know that the Hou&s;e of Lords
<PB N="70" REF="74">
is by it&s;elf the feeble&s;t part of the Con&s;ti|tution; they know that the Hou&s;e of Lords is &s;upported only by its connections with the Crown and with the Hou&s;e of Commons; and that without this double connection the Lords could not exi&s;t a &s;ingle year. They know, that all the&s;e parts of our Con&s;titu|tion, whil&s;t they are balanced as oppo&s;ing intere&s;ts, are al&s;o connected as friends; otherwi&s;e nothing but confu&s;ion could be the re&s;ult of a complex Con&s;titution. It is natural, therefore, that they who wi&s;h the common de&s;truction of the whole and of all its parts, &s;hould contend for their total &s;epa|ration. But as the Hou&s;e of Commons is that link which connects both the other parts of the Con&s;titution (the Crown and the Lords) <HI>with the Ma&s;s of the People,</HI> it is to that link (as it is natural enough) that their ince&s;&s;ant attacks are directed. That artificial repre&s;entation of the people being once di&s;credited and overturned, all goes to pieces, and nothing but a plain <HI>French</HI> de|mocracy or arbitrary monarchs can po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t.</P>
<P N="43"><PB N="71" REF="75">43. Some of the&s;e gentlemen who have attacked the Hou&s;e of Commons, lean to a repre&s;entation of the people by the head, that is, to <HI>individual repre&s;entation.</HI> None of them that I recollect, except Mr. Fox, directly rejected it. It is remarkable, how|ever, that he only rejected it by &s;imply de|claring an opinion. He let all the argu|ment go against his opinion. All the proceedings and arguments of his reforming friends lead to individual repre&s;entation and to nothing el&s;e. It de&s;erves to be attentive|ly ob&s;erved, <HI>that this individual repre&s;enta|tion is the only plan of their reform, which has been explicitly propo&s;ed.</HI> In the mean time, the conduct of Mr. Fox appears to be far more inexplicable, on any good ground, than theirs, who propo&s;e the individual re|pre&s;entation; for he neither propo&s;es any thing, nor even &s;ugge&s;ts that he has any thing to propo&s;e, in lieu of the pre&s;ent mode of con&s;tituting the Hou&s;e of Commons.&mdash;On the contrary, he declares again&s;t all the plans which have yet been &s;ugge&s;ted, ei|ther from him&s;elf or others: yet, thus un|provided
<PB N="72" REF="76">
with any plan what&s;oever, he pre&s;&s;ed forward this unknown reform with all po&s;&s;ible warmth; and for that purpo&s;e, in a &s;peech of &s;everal hours, he urged the referring to a committee, the libellous im|peachment of the Hou&s;e of Commons by the a&s;&s;ociation of the Friends of the People. But for Mr. Fox to di&s;credit Parliament <HI>as it &s;tands,</HI>&mdash;to countenance leagues, cove|nants, and a&s;&s;ociations for its further di&s;|credit,&mdash;to render it perfectly odious and contemptible,&mdash;and at the &s;ame time to propo&s;e nothing at all in place of what he di&s;graces, (is wor&s;e if po&s;&s;ible) than to con|tend for per&s;onal individual repre&s;entation, and is little le&s;s than demanding, in plain terms, to bring on plain anarchy.</P>
<P N="44">44. Mr. Fox and the&s;e gentlemen have, for the pre&s;ent, been defeated; but they are neither converted nor di&s;heartened. They have &s;olemnly declared, that they will per&s;evere until they have obtained their ends; per&s;i&s;ting to a&s;&s;ert, that the Hou&s;e of Commons not only is not a

true repre&s;entative of the people; but that it does not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of &s;uch re|pre&s;entation; mo&s;t of them in&s;i&s;t that all the debts, the taxes, and the burthens of all kinds on the people, with every other evil and inconvenience, which we have &s;uffered &s;ince the Revolution, have been owing &s;olely to an Hou&s;e of Commons which does not &s;peak the &s;en&s;e of the people.</P>
<P N="45">45. It is al&s;o not to be forgotten, that Mr. Fox, and all who hold with him, on this, as on all other occa&s;ions of pretended Reform, mo&s;t bitterly reproached Mr. Pitt with treachery, in declining to &s;upport the &s;candalous charges and indefinite projects of this infamous libel from the Friends of the People. By the animo&s;ity with which they per&s;ecute all tho&s;e who grow cold in this cau&s;e of pretended Reform, they hope, that if through levity, inexperience, or ambi|tion, any young per&s;on (like Mr. Pitt, for in&s;tance) happens to be once embarked in their de&s;ign, they &s;hall, by a fal&s;e &s;hame, keep him fa&s;t in it for ever. Many they have &s;o hampered.</P>

Whether it is nece&s;&s;arily con|nected in theory with Jacobini&s;m is not worth a di&s;pute. The two things are con|nected in fact. The partizans of the one are the partizans of the other. I know it is common with tho&s;e who are favourable to the Gentlemen of Mr. Fox's party, and to their leader, though not at all devoted to all their reforming projects, or their Gallican politics to argue in palliation of their con|duct, that it is not in their power to do all the harm which their actions evidently tend to. It is &s;aid, that as the people will not &s;up|port them, they may &s;afely be indulged in tho&s;e eccentric fancies of Reform, and tho&s;e theories which lead to nothing, This apo|logy is not very much to the honour of tho&s;e

politicians, who&s;e intere&s;ts are to be adhered to in defiance of their conduct. I cannot flat|ter my&s;elf that the&s;e ince&s;&s;ant attacks on the Con&s;titution of Parliament are &s;afe. It is not in my power to de&s;pi&s;e the uncea&s;ing ef|forts of a Confederacy of about fifty per|&s;ons of eminence; men, for the far greater part, of very ample fortunes, either in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or in expectancy; men of decided characters and vehement pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;men of very great talents of all kinds; of much boldne&s;s, and of the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;pirit of artifice, intrigue, adventure, and enter|prize, all operating with unwearied activity and per&s;everance.

Before it is made the great object of any man's political life to rai&s;e another to power, it is right to con&s;ider what are the real di&s;po&s;itions of the per&s;on to be &s;o elevated. We are not to form our judg|ment on the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions from the rules and principles of a court of Ju&s;tice, but from tho&s;e of private di&s;cretion; not looking for
<PB N="77" REF="81">
what would &s;erve to criminate another, but what is &s;ufficient to direct our&s;elves.&mdash;By a compari&s;on of a &s;eries of the di&s;cour&s;es and actions of certain men, for a rea&s;onable length of time, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to obtain &s;ufficient indication of the general tendency of their views and principles. There is no other rational mode of proceeding. It is true, that in &s;ome one or two, perhaps not well well weighed expre&s;&s;ions, or &s;ome one or two unconnected and doubtful affairs, we may and ought to judge of the actions or words, by our previous good or ill opinion of the man. But this allowance has its bounds. It does not extend to any regular cour&s;e of &s;y&s;tematic action, or of con&s;tant and repeated di&s;cour&s;e. It is again&s;t every principle of common &s;en&s;e and of ju&s;tice to one&s;elf, and to the public, to judge of a &s;eries of &s;peeches and actions from the man, and not of the man from the whole tenor of his language and conduct. Had Mr. Fox been a mini&s;ter, and proceeded in that capacity on the principles and in the manner in which he has acted during the whole of the la&s;t
<PB N="78" REF="82" MS="y">
Se&s;&s;ion, I believe he would be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t criminal &s;tate&s;man that ever exi&s;ted in this country. I do not &s;ee why a &s;tates|man out of place is not to judged of in the &s;ame manner, unle&s;s we excu&s;e him by pleading in his favor a total indifference to moral principle, and that he would &s;peak and act in quite a different way, if he were in office. I have &s;tated the above matters, not as inferring a criminal charge of evil in|tention. If I had meant to do &s;o, perhaps they are &s;tated with tolerable exactne&s;s&mdash;But I have no &s;uch view. The intentions of the&s;e Gentlemen may be very pure. I do not di&s;pute it. But I think they are in &s;ome great error. If the&s;e things are done by Mr. Fox and his friends, with good in|tentions, they are not done le&s;s danger|ou&s;ly; for it &s;hews the&s;e good intentions are not under the direction of &s;afe maxims and principles.</P>
<P N="48">48. Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, and the Gen|tlemen who call them&s;elves the phalanx, have not been &s;o very indulgent to others. They

They treat tho&s;e Members on all occa&s;ions with a &s;ort of lordly in&s;olence, tho' they are per&s;ons that (whatever homage they may pay to the eloquence of the Gentlemen who choo&s;e to look down upon them with &s;corn), are not their inferiors in any particular which calls for and obtains ju&s;t con&s;ideration from the public&mdash;not their inferiors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n knowledge of public law, or of the Con&s;titution of the kingdom&mdash;not their inferiors in their ac|quaintance with its foreign and dome&s;tic in|tere&s;ts&mdash;not their inferiors in experience or practice of bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;not their inferiors in moral character&mdash;not their inferiors in the proofs they have given of zeal and indu&s;try

We are Members of Parliament and their equals. We never con&s;ider our&s;elves as their followers.

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That their confidence in and attachment to Mr. Fox, has lately been confirmed, &s;trength|ened, and encrea&s;ed by the calumnies (as they are called) again&s;t him."</Q>
It is true, Mr. Fox and his friends have tho&s;e te&s;timonies in their favour, again&s;t certain old friends of the Duke of Portland. Yet on a full, &s;erious, and I think di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate con&s;ideration of the whole of what Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan and their friends have acted, &s;aid and written, in this Se&s;&s;ion, in&s;tead of doing any thing which might tend to procure power, or any &s;hare of it what&s;oever, to them or to their phalanx (as they call it) or to encrea&s;e their credit, influence, or popularity in the nation, I think it one of my mo&s;t &s;erious and impor|tant public duties, in what&s;oever &s;tation I may be placed for the &s;hort time I have to live, effectually to employ my be&s;t endeavours, by every prudent and every lawful means, to traver&s;e all their de&s;igns. I have only to la|ment, that my abilities are not greater, and
<PB N="82" REF="86">
that my probability of life is not better, for the more effectual pur&s;uit of that object. But I tru&s;t, that neither the principles nor exertions will die with me. I am the rather confirmed in this my re&s;olution, and in this my wi&s;h of tran&s;mitting it, becau&s;e every ray of hope concerning a po&s;&s;ible control or mitigation of the enormous mi&s;chiefs which the principles of the&s;e Gentlemen, and which their con|nections full as dangerous as their principles, might receive from the influence of the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam, on be|coming their colleagues in office, is now en|tirely bani&s;hed from the mind of every one living.&mdash;It is apparent, even to the world at large, that &s;o far from having a power to di|rect or to guide Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Grey, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. in any important matter, they have not, thro' this Se&s;&s;ion, been able to prevail on them to forbear or to delay, or mitigate, or &s;often any one act, or any one expre&s;&s;ion upon &s;ubjects on which they e&s;&s;entially differed.</P>
<P N="50"><PB N="83" REF="87" MS="y">50. Even if this hope of a po&s;&s;ible con|trol did exi&s;t, yet the declared opinions and the uniform line of conduct conformable to tho&s;e opinions, pur&s;ued by Mr. Fox, mu&s;t become a matter of &s;erious alarm if he &s;hould obtain a power either at Court or in Parliament, or in the nation at large; and for this plain rea&s;on&mdash;He mu&s;t be the mo&s;t active and efficient member in any Admini&s;tration of which he &s;hall form a part. That a man, or &s;et of men, are guid|ed by &s;uch not dubious, but delivered and avowed principles and maxims of policy as to need a watch and check on them, in the exerci&s;e of the highe&s;t power, ought, in my opinion, to make every man, who is not of the &s;ame principles, and guided by the &s;ame maxims, a little cautious how he makes him&s;elf one of the traver&s;ers of an adder, to help &s;uch a man or &s;uch a &s;et of men, to climb up to the highe&s;t authority. A mini&s;ter of this country is to be con|trolled by the Hou&s;e of Commons. He is to be tru&s;ted, not <HI>controlled,</HI> by his col|leagues in office; if he were to be control|led,
<PB N="84" REF="88">
Government, which ought to be the &s;ource of order, would it&s;elf become a &s;cene of anarchy. Be&s;ides, Mr. Fox is a man of an a&s;piring and commanding mind, made rather to control, than to be controlled, and he never will be, nor can be, in any Admini&s;tration, in which he will be guided by any of tho&s;e whom I have been ac|cu&s;tomed to confide in. It is ab&s;urd to think that he would or could. If his own opi|nions do not control him, nothing can. When we con&s;ider of an adherence to a man which leads to his power, we mu&s;t not only &s;ee what the man is, but how he &s;tands related. It is not to be forgotten that Mr. Fox acts in clo&s;e and in&s;eparable connection with another Gentleman of exactly the &s;ame de&s;cription as him&s;elf, and who, perhaps, of the two is the leader. The re&s;t of the body are not a great deal more tractable; and over them if Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan have authority, mo&s;t a&s;|&s;uredly the Duke of Portland has not the &s;malle&s;t degree of influence.</P>
<P N="51"><PB N="85" REF="89">51. One mu&s;t take care, that a blind par|tiality to &s;ome per&s;ons, and as blind an hatred to others, may not enter into our minds, under a colour of inflexible public principle. We hear, as a rea&s;on for cling|ing to Mr. Fox at pre&s;ent, that nine years ago Mr. Pitt got into power by mi&s;chievous intrigues with the Court, with the Di&s;&s;enters, and with other factious people out of Par|liament, to the di&s;credit and weakening of the power of the Hou&s;e of Commons. His conduct nine years ago I &s;till hold to be very culpable. There are, however, many things very culpable that I do not know how to puni&s;h. My opinion, on &s;uch matters, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the good of the &s;tate, as I have done on other occa&s;ions; and particu|larly with regard to the authors and ma|nagers of the American war, with whom I have acted, both in office and in oppo&s;ition, with great confidence and cordiality, though I thought many of their acts criminal and impeachable. Whil&s;t the mi&s;conduct of Mr. Pitt and his a&s;&s;ociates was yet recent, it was not po&s;&s;ible to get Mr. Fox of him|&s;elf to take a &s;ingle &s;tep, or even to counte|nance
<PB N="86" REF="90">
others in taking any &s;tep upon the ground of that mi&s;conduct and fal&s;e policy, though if the matters had been then taken up and pur&s;ued, &s;uch a &s;tep could not have ap|peared &s;o evidently de&s;perate as now it is.&mdash;So far from pur&s;uing Mr. Pitt, I know that then, and for &s;ome time after, &s;ome of Mr. Fox's friends were actually, and with no &s;mall earne&s;tne&s;s, looking out to a coalition with that gentleman. For years I never heard this, circum&s;tance of Mr. Pitt's mi&s;|conduct on that occa&s;ion mentioned by Mr. Fox, either in public or in private, as a ground for oppo&s;ition to that mini&s;ter. All oppo&s;ition, from that period to this very Se&s;&s;ion, has proceeded upon the &s;eparate mea&s;ures as they &s;eparately aro&s;e, without any vindictive retro&s;pect to Mr. Pitt's con|duct in 1784. My memory, however, may fail me. I mu&s;t appeal to the printed de|bates, which, (&s;o far as Mr. Fox is con|cerned) are unu&s;ually accurate.</P>
<P N="52">52. Whatever might have been in our power, at an early period, at this day I &s;ee no remedy for what was done in 1784. I

had no great hopes even at the time; I was therefore very eager to record a remon&s;trance on the journals of the Hou&s;e of Commons, as a caution again&s;t &s;uch a popular delu&s;ion in times to come; and this I then feared, and now am certain, is all that could be done. I know of no way of animadverting on the Crown. I know no mode of calling to account the Hou&s;e of Lords, who threw out the India Bill, in a way not much to their credit. As little, or rather le&s;s, am I able to coerce the people at large, who be|haved very unwi&s;ely and intemperately on that occa&s;ion. Mr. Pitt was then accu&s;ed, by me as well as others, of attempting to be Mini&s;ter, without enjoying the confi|dence of the Hou&s;e of Commons, though he did enjoy the confidence of the Crown. That Hou&s;e of Commons, who&s;e confidence he did not enjoy, unfortunately did not it|&s;elf enjoy the confidence, (though we well de&s;erved it) either of the Crown or of the public. For want of that confidence, the then Hou&s;e of Commons did not &s;urvive the conte&s;t. Since that period Mr. Pitt has en|joyed
<PB N="88" REF="92">
the confidence of the Crown, and of the Lords, and <HI>of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> through two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Parliaments; and I &s;u&s;pect that he has ever &s;ince, and that he does &s;till, enjoy as large a portion, at lea&s;t, of the confidence of the people without doors, as his great rival. <HI>Before</HI> whom, then, is Mr. Pitt to be impeached, and by whom? The more I con&s;ider the matter, the more firmly I am convinced, that the idea of pro&s;cribing Mr. Pitt <HI>indirectly,</HI> when you cannot <HI>directly puni&s;h</HI> him, is as chime|rical a project, and as unju&s;tifiable, as it would be to have pro&s;cribed Lord North. For &s;uppo&s;ing, that by indirect ways of op|po&s;ition, by oppo&s;ition upon mea&s;ures which do not relate to the bu&s;ine&s;s of 1784, but which on other grounds might prove unpo|pular, you were to drive him from his &s;eat, this would be no example whatever of pu|ni&s;hment for the matters we charge as of|fences in 1784. On a cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ion|ate view of the affairs of this time and country, it appears obvious to me, that one or the other of tho&s;e two great men, that
<PB N="89" REF="93">
is, Mr. Pitt or Mr. Fox, mu&s;t be Mini&s;ter. They are, I am &s;orry for it, irreconcileable. Mr. Fox's conduct <HI>in this Se&s;&s;ion</HI> has rendered the idea of his power a matter of &s;erious alarm to many people, who were very lit|tle plea&s;ed with the proceedings of Mr. Pitt in the beginning of his admini&s;tration. They like neither the conduct of Mr. Pitt, in 1784, nor that of Mr. Fox, in 1793; but they e&s;timate, which of the evils is mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing at the time, and what is likely to be the con&s;equence of a change. If Mr. Fox be wedded, they mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that his opinions and principles, on the now exi&s;ting &s;tate of things at home and abroad, mu&s;t be taken as his portion. In his train mu&s;t al&s;o be taken the whole body of gentlemen, who are pledged to him and to each other, and to their common politics and principles.&mdash;I believe no King of Great Britain ever will adopt for his confidential &s;ervants, that body of gentlemen, holding that body of principles. Even if the pre&s;ent King or his &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould think fit to take that &s;tep, I apprehend a general di&s;content of tho&s;e,
<PB N="90" REF="94">
who wi&s;h that this nation and that Europe &s;hould continue in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, would en&s;ue; a di&s;content, which, combined with the principles and progre&s;s of the new men in power, would &s;hake this kingdom to its foundations. I do not believe any one po|litical conjecture can be more certain than this.</P>
<P N="53">53. Without at all defending or palliating Mr. Pitt's conduct in 1784, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the cri&s;is of 1793, with regard to every thing at home and abroad, is full as im|portant as that of 1784 ever was; and, if for no other rea&s;on, by being pre&s;ent is much more important. It is not to nine years ago we are to look for the danger of Mr. Fox's and Mr. Sheridan's conduct, and that of the Gentlemen who act with them. It is at <HI>this</HI> very time, and in <HI>this</HI> very &s;e&s;&s;ion, that, if they had not been &s;trenuou&s;ly re|&s;i&s;ted, they would not only merely have di&s;|credited the Hou&s;e of Commons (as Mr. Pitt did in 1784, when he per&s;uaded the King to reject their advice, and to appeal
<PB N="91" REF="95">
from them to the people), but, in my opi|nion, would have been the means of wholly &s;ubverting the Hou&s;e of Commons and the Hou&s;e of Peers, and the whole Con&s;titution actual and virtual, together with the &s;afety and independence of this nation, and of the peace and &s;ettlement of every &s;tate in the now Chri&s;tian world. It is to our opinion of the nature of Jacobini&s;m, and of the probability by corruption, faction, and force, of its gaining ground every where, that the que&s;tion who and what you are to &s;upport is to be determined. For my part, without doubt or he&s;itation, I look upon Jacobini&s;m as the mo&s;t dreadful, and the mo&s;t &s;hame|ful evil, which ever afflicted mankind; a &s;ting which goes beyond the power of all calculation in its mi&s;chief; and that if it is &s;uffered to exi&s;t in France, we mu&s;t in England, and &s;peedily too, fall into that calamity.</P>
<P N="54">54. I figure to my&s;elf the purpo&s;e of the&s;e Gentlemen accompli&s;hed, and this Mini&s;try de&s;troyed. I &s;ee that the per&s;ons who in
<PB N="92" REF="96">
that ca&s;e mu&s;t rule, can be no other than Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Grey, the Marquis of Lan&s;downe, Lord Thurlow, Lord Lauderdale, and the Duke of Norfolk, with the other Chiefs of the Friends of the People, the Parliamentary Reformers, and the Admirers of the French Revolution. The principal of the&s;e are all formally pledged to their projects. If the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam &s;hould be admitted into that &s;y&s;tem (as they might and probably would be), it is quite certain they could not have the &s;malle&s;t weight in it; le&s;s, indeed, than what they now po&s;|&s;e&s;s, if le&s;s were po&s;&s;ible: becau&s;e they would be le&s;s wanted than they now are; and becau&s;e all tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to join, them, and to act under them, have been re|jected by the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam them&s;elves; and Mr. Fox, find|ing them thus by them&s;elves di&s;armed, has built quite a new fabric, upon quite a new foundation. There is no trifling on this &s;ubject. We &s;ee very di&s;tinctly before us the Mini&s;try that would be formed, and the
<PB N="93" REF="97">
plan that would be pur&s;ued. If we like the plan, we mu&s;t wi&s;h the power of tho&s;e who are to carry it into execution; but to pur|&s;ue the political exaltation of tho&s;e who&s;e political mea&s;ures we di&s;approve, and who&s;e principles we di&s;&s;ent from, is a &s;pecies of modern politics not ea&s;ily comprehen&s;ible, and which mu&s;t end in the ruin of the country, if it &s;hould continue and &s;pread. Mr. Pitt may be the wor&s;t of men, and Mr. Fox may be the be&s;t; but, at pre&s;ent, the former is in the intere&s;t of his country, and of the order of things long e&s;tabli&s;hed in Europe: Mr. Fox is not. I have, for one, been born in this order of things, and would fain die in it. I am &s;ure it is &s;ufficient to make men as virtuous, as happy, and as knowing as any thing which Mr. Fox, and his friends abroad or at home, would &s;ub|&s;titute in its place; and I &s;hould be &s;orry that any &s;et of politicians &s;hould obtain power in England, who&s;e principles or &s;chemes &s;hould lead them to countenance per&s;ons or factions who&s;e object is to intro|duce &s;ome new devi&s;ed order of things into
<PB N="94" REF="98">
England, or to &s;upport that order where it is already introduced, in France; a place, in which if it can be fixed, in my mind, it mu&s;t have a certain and decided influence in and upon this kingdom. This is my ac|count of my conduct to my private friends. I have already &s;aid all I wi&s;h to &s;ay, or nearly &s;o, to the public. I write this with pain, and with an heart full of grief!</P>
