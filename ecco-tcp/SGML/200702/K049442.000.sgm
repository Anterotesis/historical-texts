<HEAD>THE Fifteen Comforts, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Fir&s;t Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>BE Dumb ye Beggars of the Rhiming Trade</L>
<L>Geld the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;e Wits, and let the Mu&s;e be Splaid</L>
<L>Charge not the Pari&s;h with the Ba&s;tard Phra&s;e</L>
<L>Of <HI>Balm, Elixar,</HI> both the <HI>India</HI>'s,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Shrine, Saint, Sacriledge,</HI> and &s;uch as the&s;e</L>
<L>Expre&s;&s;ions, common as their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</L>
<L>Of her I write, no Pen can reach her Worth,</L>
<L>Nor find an Epithet to &s;et her forth;</L>
<L>I mean Heroick <HI>Anne,</HI> our Gracious Queen,</L>
<L>In War Victorious, and in Pomp Serene;</L>
<L>The Circle of who&s;e Reign contains all Bli&s;s,</L>
<L>And daily &s;tudies <HI>Scotland</HI>'s Happine&s;s.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Second Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>Now Sacred <HI>Anne</HI> does wear the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown,</L>
<L>The Church does flouri&s;h, and is lofty grown;</L>
<L>The Laws are ri&s;en from a long, long Trance,</L>
<L>And our uniting is a Check to <HI>France;</HI></L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="3">
Which Union even would make our Foes Bap|tize</L>
<L>Them&s;elves all Converts in our watry Eyes;</L>
<L>Which we for very Joy do weep, to &s;ee</L>
<L>How <HI>Anne</HI> de&s;igns to make Po&s;terity</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">or ever happy, whil&s;t She's on the Throne,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n making <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> both as One.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Third Comfort</HEAD>
<L>Among the num'rous Throng, we <HI>Scots</HI> do come,</L>
<L>To wi&s;h the grand Support of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI></L>
<L>Health, that's the Joy of Life, and Soul of Mirth,</L>
<L>Bane of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> and Comfort of our Birth:</L>
<L>May't with your Years, as clearly la&s;t and ri&s;e,</L>
<L>As 'twas e'er Winds had bla&s;ted Paradi&s;e!</L>
<L>Wealth! the Support of Plea&s;ure and the Crown,</L>
<L>The only Prop of Glory and Renown.</L>
<L>May the &s;ame virtuous Temper, the &s;ame Fire,</L>
<L>That never flags too low, nor do's mount higher,</L>
<L>Enflame your Brea&s;t, and to't by Heaven be &s;ent</L>
<L>That which all &s;eek (but find not) true Content.</L>
<L>May all your Aims atchieve their purpos'd End,</L>
<L>Then Loyal <HI>Scotland</HI> ne'er will want a Friend,</L>
<L>To be the Guardian of their Church and State,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t the <HI>Ro&s;e</HI> and <HI>Thi&s;tle</HI> do incorporate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Fourth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>Poor lou&s;ie, beggar'd <HI>France,</HI> &amp; half-&s;tarv'd <HI>Spain,</HI></L>
<L>Dur&s;t not pre&s;ume t' appear upon the Main;</L>
<L>For now St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> and St. <HI>George</HI> do joyn,</L>
<L>Upon the Ocean they'll in Glory &s;hine.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4">
Whose Union-Colours on the rolling Sea,</L>
<L>Will &s;hew the Force of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Heraldry:</L>
<L>Thus on that Element the <HI>Scots</HI> too Fame</L>
<L>Will get, and to tho encient <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Name</L>
<L>Will Honour add, by having &s;uch a Fleet</L>
<L>That dur&s;t our Foe upon the Ocean meet,</L>
<L>And make them low'r their Top-&s;ails too at Sea,</L>
<L>As owning that the only Sovereignty</L>
<L>Thereof is Sacred <HI>Anna</HI>'s Lawful Right,</L>
<L>For which Her Loyal Subjects too will Fight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Fifth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>In a <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion now the Crown</L>
<L>Is fix'd, and none mu&s;t mount the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne,</L>
<L>But what will the reformed Faith defend,</L>
<L>And to the Church of <HI>England</HI> be a Friend;</L>
<L>For by her Grandeur we &s;upported be,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t Con&s;cience do's enjoy its Liberty.</L>
<L>And that which al&s;o gives our Hearts Content,</L>
<L>As that two Nations has one Parliament.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Sixth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>As to our Comforts what can more be &s;aid?</L>
<L>Freedom we have, and Intercour&s;e of Trade,</L>
<L>To any Port or Place the Kingdom round;</L>
<L>Be&s;ides, all <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Ships that &s;hall be found,</L>
<L>At Signing of this Treaty, on the Sea,</L>
<L>Of any &s;ort of Foreign Built, &s;hall be</L>
<L>As Ships of the Built of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> deem'd:</L>
<L>So much is <HI>Scotland</HI> by the Queen e&s;teem'd,</L>
<L>That Her Indulgence makes us all con&s;pire</L>
<L>To act, and to comply with Her De&s;ire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="5">
<HEAD>The Seventh Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>Now, now, old <HI>Scotland</HI> is for ever made,</L>
<L>Since (with the <HI>Engli&s;h)</HI> in the way of Trade,</L>
<L>We have the &s;ame Allowances, Re&s;titutions,</L>
<L>Lawful Encouragements, and Prohibitions.</L>
<L>No Article the Loyal <HI>Scots</HI> do blame,</L>
<L>For Exci&s;e with us, as you, is all the &s;ame;</L>
<L>For &s;even Years we &s;hall be Duty-free</L>
<L>In making Salt; and farthermore we &s;ee,</L>
<L>The Land-Tax will be very ea&s;ie here,</L>
<L>The Yoak is light for any one to bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Eighth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>Duties on Paper Stamp'd we &s;hall not pay,</L>
<L>Nor Duties which they do on Velome lay;</L>
<L>And farther to confirm us in our Rights,</L>
<L>We &s;hall no Duty pay for Window-Lights;</L>
<L>Nay, Royal Favours &s;till are more enlarg'd,</L>
<L>For Coals con&s;um'd at Home we &s;han't be charg'd,</L>
<L>Nor charg'd with any Duty laid on Malt,</L>
<L>So if we won't unite, 'tis all our Fault:</L>
<L>Both Nations will be one, and we &s;hall be</L>
<L>To all Intents as <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> (Sir) free;</L>
<L>All Animo&s;ities being laid a&s;ide,</L>
<L>In Love and Unity we &s;hall take Pride,</L>
<L>And in Eternal Friend&s;hip &s;o di&s;po&s;e</L>
<L>Our &s;elves, as to be dreadful to our Foes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Ninth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>One <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament will now be made,</L>
<L>And we have an Equivalent in Trade:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6">
The Coin of the united Kingdoms too</L>
<L>Be all alike, that all may have their Due:</L>
<L>Our Weights and Mea&s;ures too mu&s;t be the &s;ame,</L>
<L>That People may not diff'rent Mea&s;ures b lame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Tenth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>The Laws concerning regulating Trade,</L>
<L>In favour of our Con&s;titution's made;</L>
<L>The Court of Se&s;&s;ions mu&s;t the &s;ame remain</L>
<L>As formerly, in this the pre&s;ent Reign;</L>
<L>All Mi&s;demeanours done upon the Sea,</L>
<L>To be &s;ubject to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Admiralty.</L>
<L>Nay, further to encrea&s;e our Happine&s;s,</L>
<L>Men Offices for Life may &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s;</L>
<L>And yet to make us happy o'er again,</L>
<L>The Queen is pleas'd, that all the Rights remain</L>
<L>Of Royal <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Burroughs, as they now</L>
<L>At pre&s;ent are: What more can She allow?</L>
<L>Or we from Royal Bounty &s;till require,</L>
<L>Since we have all as Subjects can de&s;ire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Eleventh Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>We &s;hall have Lords and Commons too to &s;it</L>
<L>In Parliament, where're the Queen thinks fit,</L>
<L>Who will have all the Priviledges too,</L>
<L>That's really to their noble Peerage due;</L>
<L>The &s;ame as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Peers they will enjoy,</L>
<L>Which Treaty will the Hopes of <HI>France</HI> de&s;troy</L>
<L>And that in time we may our Breaches heal,</L>
<L><HI>Great-Britain</HI> mu&s;t but u&s;e one only Seal,</L>
<L>Quartered with tho&s;e Arms as be&s;t may &s;ure,</L>
<L>This Union, which makes <HI>ANNA</HI> ab&s;olute,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="7">
Empre&s;s Imperial over the Ble&s;s'd Realm,</L>
<L>Of which She does &s;o wi&s;ely rule the Helm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Twelfth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>All Laws and Statutes in each Realm, &s;o far</L>
<L>As to the Union they contrary are,</L>
<L>From and after it they cea&s;e, and &s;hall be void,</L>
<L>That Liberty by us may be enjoy'd.</L>
<L>What can we then of <HI>England</HI> ask for more,</L>
<L>No greater Ble&s;&s;ings they can have in &s;tore,</L>
<L>Than what are granted, &s;o let's all &s;it down,</L>
<L>And drink the Health of <HI>Anne,</HI> who wears the Crown,</L>
<L>And wi&s;h Her long to Reign, that She may be</L>
<L>A Terror to the <HI>Gallick</HI> Monarchy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>The Thirteenth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>The <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Parliament has done their be&s;t,</L>
<L>That the&s;e two Kingdoms may be doubly ble&s;t;</L>
<L>Upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament we wait,</L>
<L>With low Submi&s;&s;ion for to know our Fate,</L>
<L>Hoping kind Heav'n will cau&s;e them to agree</L>
<L>To this long wi&s;h'd and hop'd for Unity,</L>
<L>Which &s;urely will prove of &s;uch Con&s;equence,</L>
<L>That it will be a Thorn i' th' &s;ide of <HI>France,</HI></L>
<L>And make them rue the Day that e'er we came</L>
<L>To be a People of one Crown, and Name:</L>
<L>For our uniting makes the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> fear,</L>
<L>Some dreadful Storm's to them approaching near.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="8">
<HEAD>The Fourteenth Comfort.</HEAD>
<L>Now, now, the <HI>Scots</HI> with <HI>England</HI> do unite,</L>
<L><HI>Lewis</HI> and <HI>Maintenon</HI> are in a Fright;</L>
<L>Ye <HI>Spaniards</HI> too, your drooping Kingdom drench</L>
<L>Till Tears the Flames of <HI>Purgatory</HI> quench:</L>
<L>But you that can't cry, yet would &s;eem to weep</L>
<L>Your Hankerchiefs in Holy Water &s;teep,</L>
<L>Then Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and the Saints invoke,</L>
<L>To keep your Kingdom from the <HI>Frenchmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Yoke</L>
<L>But if ye'll &s;till be Fools, and will not own</L>
<L>King <HI>Charles,</HI> by Force we'll put on him a Crown</L>
