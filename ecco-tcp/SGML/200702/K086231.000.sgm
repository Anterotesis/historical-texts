<P>THE INSOLVENT: OR, FILIAL PIETY. A TRAGEDY.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>ABOVE thirty years ago, Mr. WILKS (then one of the patentees of the theatre royal) gave an old manu&s;cript play, call'd, <HI>The Guiltle&s;s Adultre&s;s; or, Judge in his own Cau&s;e,</HI> to Mr. THEOPHILUS CIBBER, who was then manager of what us'd to be call'd, <HI>the &s;ummer company.</HI> This company con&s;i&s;ted, in general, of the junior part of the performers; who, during the vacation time, commonly acted twice, or thrice, a week. As they play'd on &s;hares (divided in proportion ac|cording to their &s;everal &s;alaries &s;tipulated in the winter) their endeavours to plea&s;e the town generally produc'd 'em double pay, on tho&s;e nights; &s;ometimes more.</P>
<P>This kept mo&s;t of 'em from &s;trolling into the country, for the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on: it added to their income, and gave 'em an op|portunity of getting forward in their bu&s;ine&s;s, in a more regular manner, than has been practis'd of late years. It had its effect: performers then try'd their force in characters, in the &s;ummer; and became, by practice therein, gradually acquainted with their bu&s;ine&s;s, and the town with them. Nor was every one &s;uppos'd to be equal, at their very &s;etting out, to the mo&s;t capital characters of the drama.</P>
<P>But to return to the play.&mdash;By the hand, and the long time it had been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the managers, it was &s;uppos'd to have been one of Sir WILLIAM D'AVENANT's (formerly a patentee) and, by the opening of the piece, palpably was found|ed on a play of MASSENGER's, call'd, <HI>The Fatal Dowry&mdash;</HI>(this la&s;t piece has often been enquired after in vain)&mdash;Mr. WILKS recommended it to Mr. CIBBER to be got up in the &s;ummer, with &s;ome alterations&mdash;It lay by &s;ome time.&mdash;In the year 1733, it was intended for the &s;tage in the &s;ummer&mdash;But the performers were then &s;hut out of the theatre, by the then patentees of Drury-Lane.&mdash;A candid account of which will be given, when Mr. CIBBER has a proper opportunity to &s;peak thereof, in his purpos'd hi&s;tory of the &s;tage.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
In the following year, when the principal comedians of that time return'd from the theatre in the Hay-Market, and play'd under the direction of Mr. FLETEWOOD, it was propos'd agen to have a &s;ummer company; as the u&s;e of it, both to the actors and managers, had been experienced. Many light pieces were then reviv'd, and &s;everal new petit pieces brought on the &s;tage; &s;uch as, <HI>The Devil to Pay, The Mock Doctor,</HI> &amp;c. which prov'd afterwards la&s;ting entertainments in the winter &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>'Twas in <HI>The Devil to Pay,</HI> in a &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, Mrs. CLIVE (then Mi&s;s KAFTOR) fir&s;t &s;urpriz'd a delighted audi|ence with a proof of her extraordinary genius, in the character of NELL. Her &s;pirited &s;implicity, and &s;trong natural humour, carried her thro' the part with an a&s;toni&s;hing variety, and pro|priety. She &s;hew'd her&s;elf an excellent original.&mdash;She has had many followers, &s;ome imitators; and, 'tis but ju&s;tice to add, no equal. She then promis'd to be, what &s;he has &s;ince prov'd, one of the fir&s;t performers of the &s;tage: and, when judi|ciou&s;ly examined in the general various ca&s;t of parts &s;he acts, 'tis imagined, &s;he will be allow'd not to be inferior to any per|former of her time.</P>
<P>Well, this is digre&s;&s;ion on digre&s;&s;ion&mdash;(pardon it, reader, and let it pa&s;s)&mdash;In 1734, a &s;ummer company was agen pro|pos'd. They play'd once the play of <HI>George Barnwell,</HI> to a very great hou&s;e. The manager (jealous, lea&s;t the company &s;hou'd get too much) order'd the farther acting to be &s;topp'd. It was judg'd, indeed, the jealou&s;y of &s;ome actors (who were not concern'd in the &s;ummer) gave this advice&mdash;&s;o the affair dropp'd&mdash;and there has been no &s;ummer playing &s;ince.</P>
<P>But, to return to our play.&mdash;On a revi&s;al, it was judg'd to want &s;ome alterations&mdash;Accordingly, Mr. CIBBEE reque&s;ted his kind friend the late Mr. HILL (who was never happier than when he had an opportunity to do a friendly office) to correct it&mdash;How much he was taken with the play, will appear on a peru&s;al of &s;ome letters of his relative thereto, (pub|li&s;h'd in his collection) and &s;ent to Mr. THEOPHILUS CIBBER, about the year 1746.&mdash;Let it &s;uffice here, to add&mdash;Mr. HILL almo&s;t new wrote the whole; and the la&s;t act was entirely his, in conduct, &s;entiment, diction, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
It was brought on the &s;tage at the theatre in the Hay-Market early this year, 1758&mdash;When his Grace the Duke of DEVON|SHIRE humanely con&s;ider'd the unfortunate, extraordinary condition of a comedian (who has had more frequent opportu|nities of happily entertaining the town) and gave him liberty to try his fortune, awhile, at the little theatre in the Hay-Market.</P>
<P>But what mighty matters could be hop'd, from a young, raw, unexperienced company, ha&s;tily collected, and as ha&s;tily to be employ'd (but &s;inking men catch at reeds) while e&s;tabli&s;h'd theatres were open to entertain the town, with the united force of tragedy, comedy, opera, pantomime, &s;ong, dance, and a long train of <HI>et ceteras&mdash;</HI>Some rational, and &s;ome other ex|hibitions, which are &s;o frequently follow'd in a winter &s;ea&s;on?</P>
<P>Mr. CIBBER was out of pocket by his undertaking; yet this does not prevent his having a grateful &s;en&s;e of the favours he received, from tho&s;e noble per&s;onages, and other friends, who have frequently pratonis'd his undertakings.&mdash;To acknow|ledge a favour, is but gratitude&mdash;To name the per&s;ons, might appear vanity.</P>
<P>It may not be improper, on this occa&s;ion to &s;ignify, as Mr. CIBBER has not had the wi&s;h'd &s;ucce&s;s at the theatre in the Hay-Market&mdash;That Mr. RICH has, with great good-nature, granted the u&s;e of his theatre in Covent-Garden to Mr. CIBBER, for his benefit, the beginning of next month&mdash;When a <HI>new mock-tragedy,</HI> (which many per&s;ons of ta&s;te have approv'd of, and which the author has kindly allow'd Mr. CIBBER to make u&s;e of on this occa&s;ion) will be acted, with all the variety of &s;cenes, machines, &s;ongs, dirges, proce&s;&s;ions, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;requi&s;ite to embelli&s;h (<HI>a-la-moderne</HI>) this extraordinary heroick piece.</P>

<LG>
<L>OUR &s;cenes, to-night, would nature's pangs impart;</L>
<L>True filiel piety &s;hould reach the heart.</L>
<L>I feel it now&mdash;That thought the tear &s;hall claim;</L>
<L>To merit &s;acred, and immortal fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now &s;leeps the honour'd du&s;t, which gave me birth;</L>
<L>Recent in death, but newly lodg'd in earth:</L>
<L>Forgive the heart-felt grief! the filial lay!</L>
<L>The public tear might drop o'er CIBBER's clay!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His comic force&mdash;for more than half an age;</L>
<L>His well-wrote moral &s;cene, his manly page,</L>
<L>Your fathers fathers pleas'd&mdash;His &s;cenes &s;hall live;</L>
<L>And, to your childrens children, equal plea&s;ure give.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Forgive the filial dews that thus di&s;til&mdash;</L>
<L>'Tis from the heart they flow, and not from skill:</L>
<L>By nature mov'd, your patience thus I try;</L>
<L>Art would but give my &s;uff'ring &s;oul the lie.</L>
<L>Now for the father's &s;ake, the &s;on endure;</L>
<L>Let his paternal worth your &s;mile &s;ecure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let his rich merit my poor wants attone;</L>
<L>His high de&s;ert I plead&mdash;Boa&s;t none my own.</L>
<L>Let then this tribute, to the father due;</L>
<L>This public tribute, be approv'd by you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whatever faults may thro' this piece be &s;hewn,</L>
<L>No living bard can now tho&s;e faults attone,</L>
<L>While &s;uch you, tran&s;ient, mark&mdash;Let mercy &s;pare,</L>
<L>Such parts as you may think &s;ome merit &s;hare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where judgment wakes, let candour intervene,</L>
<L>Mark out the failings with that golden mean,</L>
<L>Nor for a &s;ingle &s;entence damn a &s;cene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To our young actors too your &s;miles extend;</L>
<L>Youth claims indulgence&mdash;as want claims a friend:</L>
<L>Whate'er their flatt'ring hopes, their fears are great,</L>
<L>Which your applau&s;e alone can di&s;&s;ipate:</L>
<L>And, 'tis a maxim with the truly brave,</L>
<L>They triumph mo&s;t, who generou&s;ly &s;ave.</L>

<LG>
<L>I'VE '&s;cap'd, to-night, two terrible di&s;a&s;ters;</L>
<L>My honour's indignation&mdash;and my ma&s;ter's:</L>
<L>And heaven be&s;t knows what haple&s;s hole can hide me,</L>
<L>If (to crown all my woes) your help's deny'd me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LADIES, you &s;ee how much expos'd our &s;ex is;</L>
<L>Sleeping, or waking, &s;ome &s;ad chance perplexes.</L>
<L>Man's a more wily &s;nake than mother EVE's was;</L>
<L>In his own &s;hape&mdash;and others too&mdash;deceives us.</L>
<L>Hungry devourer! never tir'd with &s;napping;</L>
<L>Shun him with open eyes&mdash;he'll catch us napping:</L>
<L>And how to '&s;cape him, if I know&mdash;ne'er let me</L>
<L>Break thro' th' entangling nets, that thus be&s;et me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, GENTLEMEN, to your own thoughts appealing,</L>
<L>(Fitter, I doubt, for making wounds&mdash;than healing)</L>
<L>What wou'd you have poor women do with honour,</L>
<L>When danger heaps &s;uch mon&s;trous loads upon her?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>D'ye think in con&s;cience now&mdash;half-wak'd, half-weary</L>
<L>With foregone frights, for one's departed deary&mdash;</L>
<L>'Thad been &s;o &s;trange a crime&mdash;or worth &s;uch pother,</L>

<L>Pray think on't&mdash;Put your&s;elves behind the curtain;</L>
<L>What can't be cur'd mu&s;t be endur'd&mdash;that's certain.</L>
