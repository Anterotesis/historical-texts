<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Eleventh Century <HI>Sigurd,</HI> Earl of the
Orkney-I&s;lands, went with a fleet of &s;hips and a
con&s;iderable body of troops into Ireland, to the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of <HI>Sictryg with the &s;ilken beard,</HI> who was then
making war on his father-in-law <HI>Brian,</HI> King of
Dublin: the Earl and all his forces were cut to
pieces, and <HI>Sictryg</HI> was in danger of a total defeat;
but the enemy had a greater lo&s;s by the death of
<HI>Brian,</HI> their King, who fell in the action. On
Chri&s;tmas-day, (the day of the battle,) a Native of
<HI>Gaithne&s;s</HI> in Scotland &s;aw at a di&s;tance a number of
per&s;ons on hor&s;eback riding full &s;peed towards a hill,
<PB REF="71">
and &s;eeming to enter into it. Curio&s;ity led him to
follow them, till looking through an opening in the
rocks he &s;aw twelve gigantic figures re&s;embling wo|men:
they were all employed about a loom; and as
they wove, they &s;ung the following dreadful Song;
which when they had fini&s;hed, they tore the web into
twelve pieces, and (each taking her portion) gal|loped
Six to the North and as many to the South.</P>
