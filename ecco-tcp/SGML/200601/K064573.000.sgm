<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WHatever we poor <HI>Au|thors</HI>
may &s;ometimes
pretend to, by the De|dication
of our Works
to <HI>Great</HI> Men; it's cer|tain
we aim at nothing le&s;s than Re|wards
we de&s;erve them or not: That this
is my De&s;ign in <HI>Dedications,</HI> is &s;o
apparent, that it's to no Purpo&s;e to
deny or di&s;&s;emble it.</P>
<P>Wherefore el&s;e have I made
Choice of &s;ome of our Learned and
Wealthy <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> for the Patrons of
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
the&s;e <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> which I fore&s;aw
would be grateful to their nice and
critical Palates? Wherefore el&s;e
have I been &s;o profu&s;e of &s;uch Com|pliments
on their <HI>Lord&s;hips,</HI> as I
was &s;ure, they would take great
Plea&s;ure in? Wherefore el&s;e, <HI>My
Lord,</HI> do I in&s;cribe <HI>this</HI> to your
<HI>Right Reverend</HI> Name, but that I
expect your Approbation of it, and</P>
<P>Some, who are envious, <HI>My Lord,</HI>
of my good Fortune in <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Pa|trons,
will not believe that I have
receiv'd &s;o much as one <HI>Pur&s;e</HI> of
<HI>Gold</HI> for any of my <HI>Dedications</HI>; but
I would have &s;uch Malignants to
know, that the le&s;s I have receiv'd,
the more there is behind: And I
can moreover a&s;&s;ure them, that
their <HI>Lord&s;hips</HI> have it in their Heads
and their Hearts too, highly to ad|vance
me in the World; and if their
Endeavours for my Promotion fail
not, I &s;hall be a very <HI>Great</HI> Man.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">
Such primitive Doctrine, <HI>My
Lord,</HI> as I have reviv'd, mu&s;t, in the
Judgment of our <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> be de&s;erv|ing
of their di&s;tingui&s;h'd Favours:
And if they &s;hould De&s;ign for me
&s;uch a <HI>my&s;tical</HI> Crown of Glory, as
the <HI>Gentile Prie&s;ts</HI> help'd &s;ome of
the Fathers of the Church to; I
profe&s;s without Di&s;&s;imulation, that,
for all my Love to <HI>My&s;teries,</HI> it will
be more than I am ambitious of:
But if the Honour is forc'd on me,
it will be my Duty to their <HI>Lord|&s;hips,</HI>
to &s;ound an <HI>allegorical</HI> Trum|pet
of their Fame, that their
Names, which might otherwi&s;e be
&s;oon forgotten, may be everla&s;ting|ly
remember'd for their Love and
Good-will towards me.</P>
<P>But the chief Foundation, <HI>My
Lord,</HI> of my Merits lies, they &s;ay,
in my Treatment of the Miracles
of our Saviour, after the Manner
you handled a Scripture-Prophecy,
of a <HI>Man's kicking a Serpent on the
Pate, for biting him by the Heels</HI>:
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
And if your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> got a <HI>Wel&s;h-Bi&s;hoprick</HI>

expect for my more meritorious
Works of the &s;ame kind? The
Great <HI>Mr. Scheme</HI> has celebrated
your Prai&s;e for that Effort of your
Wit: And I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, to your

your Thoughts unhappily &s;hackled

Unhappine&s;s you &s;adly lament!)
you would endeavour to make as
plea&s;ant Work with the <HI>Letter</HI> of
the <HI>Old,</HI> as I can do with that of
the <HI>New</HI> Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>I have not here Room, <HI>My Lord,</HI>
for a &s;ufficient and de&s;erv'd <HI>Enco|mium</HI>
on your <HI>U&s;e and Intent of Pro|phecy</HI>;
therefore mu&s;t be content to
&s;ay of it, in &s;hort, that it is a mo&s;t
curious Piece of, what the Fathers
call, <HI>Enga&s;tromuthi&s;m</HI>; or &s;uch a
&s;ingular Specimen of a Webb, &s;pun
out of a Man's own Bowels, as one
of fewer Brains in his Head can
hardly equal.</P>

to caution your Readers again&s;t

that &s;ome Annotations out of the

&s;hould I then have admired the

<P>_ACcording to Promi&s;e in my
la&s;t <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> I am in <HI>this</HI>
to take into Examination
the three Miracles of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
rai&s;ing the dead, <HI>viz.</HI> Of
<HI>Iairus</HI>'s Daughter <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mat. ix. Mark v. Luke viii.</NOTE>; of

<PB N="2" REF="9">
I &s;hall &s;how to con&s;i&s;t of Ab&s;urdities, Im|probabilities
and Incredibilities, in Order
to the my&s;tical Interpretation of them:
And becau&s;e &s;ome of our <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Cler|gy</HI>
were a little di&s;gu&s;ted at the ludicrous
Treatment of the <HI>Letter</HI> of &s;ome foregoing
Miracles, I will handle the&s;e with the
more Caution; being as unwilling, as any
Man of my primitive Faith can be, to
offend weak Brethren.</P>
<P>Whether <HI>Je&s;us</HI> rais'd any more from the
dead, be&s;ides the fore&s;aid three Per&s;ons is
uncertain from the Evangelical Hi&s;tory.
St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Quot autem mortuos vi&s;ibiliter &s;u&s;citaverat quis novit? non enim omnia quae fecit &s;cripta &s;unt. <HI>Jo|hannes</HI> hoc dicit, multa alia fecit Je&s;us, quae &s;i &s;cripta e&s;&s;ent, arbitror totum Mundum non po&s;&s;e Libros capere.

 <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">John xxi. 25.</NOTE> <HI>the World it &s;elf could not con|tain
the Books that might be Written of Je|&s;us.</HI>
And <HI>Eu&s;ebius Gallicanus,</HI> of who&s;e
Mind entirely I am, &s;ays <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Non autem vacat a My&s;terio, quod, cum plur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Dominus &s;u&s;citaverat, tres tantum Evangeli&s;tae eum &s;u&s;|cita&s;&s;e &s;crip&s;erunt. <HI>In Homil. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> quintae po&s;t Domi|nic. </HI>4<HI>tam.</HI></NOTE> the Rea&s;on
lies in the My&s;tery, why the&s;e <HI>three,</HI> and
no more than the&s;e <HI>three</HI> Miracles of this
<PB N="3" REF="10">
Kind are recorded by the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts.</HI> But
&s;ince our <HI>Divines</HI> are aver&s;e to My&s;teries on
Miracles, I would gladly know their Opi|nion,
whether <HI>Je&s;us</HI> rais'd any others from
the dead, or not: I have made &s;ome &s;earch
into modern Writers for their Opinion in
this Ca&s;e, but can't find it: And unle&s;s
I knew their Opinion, it would be lo&s;t
Labour to argue again&s;t either Side of the
Que&s;tion, and much more again&s;t both
Sides of it: But I can a&s;&s;ure our <HI>Divines,</HI>
that, which Side of the Que&s;tion &s;oever
they &s;hould hold, the Con&s;equence upon
the Argument would be neither better nor
wor&s;e, than that they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity
e&s;pou&s;e the my&s;tical and allegorical Inter|pretation
of the&s;e Miracles, or grant that
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> literally rais'd none from the dead
at all.</P>
<P>But waving that &s;ort of Argument for
the pre&s;ent again&s;t the <HI>Letter</HI>; the&s;e three
Miracles are reputed the greate&s;t that <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
wrought: And I believe, it will be
granted on all hands, that the re&s;toring a
Per&s;on, indi&s;putably dead, to Life again,
is a &s;tupendous Miracle; and that two or
three &s;uch Miracles well circum&s;tanced,
and credibly reported, are enough to con|ciliate
the Belief of Mankind, that the
Author of them was a divine Agent, and
inve&s;ted with the Power of God, or he
<PB N="4" REF="11">
could not do them. But God knows, (and
for the &s;ake of the My&s;tery, I am not
&s;orry to &s;ay it) this is far from being the
Ca&s;e of the&s;e three Miracles before us, or
of any one them.</P>
<P>That the&s;e three Miracles are not equal|ly
great, but differ in Degree, is vi&s;ible
enough to any one, that but cur&s;orily reads,
and compares theirs Stories one with ano|ther.
The Fathers of the Church <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">Su&s;citaverat Dominus filiam Jairi Principis Syna|gogr, &s;ed adhuc mediante morte, adhuc viante Spiritu, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">huc Anima Clau&s;tra Tartari ne&s;ciente.

have taken Notice of &s;uch a Difference
among&s;t them. The greate&s;t of the three,
and indeed, the <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Inter omnia Miracula quae fecit Dominus no&s;te. Je&s;u Chri&s;tus, Lazari Re&s;urrectio <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">praecipue praedicatur. <HI>St. Augu&s;t. in Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> greate&s;t Miracle, that
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> is &s;uppos'd to have wrought, is that
of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Re&s;urrection; which, in
Truth, was a mo&s;t prodigious Miracle, if
his Corps was putrified and &s;tank; or if
there were no ju&s;t Exceptions to be made
to the Credibility of the Story. Next to
that, in magnitude, is <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s rai&s;ing of
<PB N="5" REF="12">
the Widow's Son, as they were carrying
him to his Burial: And a great Miracle it
was to bring him to Life again; if none be|fore
or &s;ince had been mi&s;taken for dead,
and carried to their Graves alive; or if
no Impo&s;tor and his Confederates could
frame &s;uch a &s;eemingly miraculous Scene,
as is that whole Story, to his own Glory.
The lea&s;t of the three is that of his rai&s;ing
<HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter, which in Appearance
is &s;o far from a Miracle, that according to
the Story it&s;elf, &s;he was but a&s;leep, or by
the Shrieks of By-&s;tanders frighted out of
her Sen&s;es for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But however it really might be with
the&s;e three &s;uppo&s;ed dead and revived Per|&s;ons;
the Ca&s;e of none of them was well
enough circum&s;tanced to &s;erve the Purpo&s;e
of our <HI>Divines.</HI> I am apt to believe with
the Fathers, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> actually did rai&s;e
the dead; but then, as the&s;e Miracles are
only recorded for the &s;ake of the <HI>My&s;tery,</HI>
I affirm that none of them, as to the
<HI>Letter,</HI> will abide the Te&s;t of a critcal
Examination, nor &s;tand its Ground again&s;t
&s;uch Exceptions as may be made to them.
If <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was to rai&s;e any dead Bodies to
Life, for a Te&s;timony of his divine Power
and Authority, he would and &s;hould have
made Choice of other dead Per&s;ons, un|der
other Circum&s;tances of Death; and
<PB N="6" REF="13">
the Hi&s;tory of their Re&s;urrection &s;hould
have been more credibly and carefully
tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity, &s;o as there &s;hould
have been no Room left to make a rea&s;ona|ble
Doubt of the Truth of it. But this,
I &s;ay, is not the Ca&s;e in the Re&s;u&s;citation
of any of the&s;e Per&s;ons, as will appear
from the following Remarks and Ob&s;er|vations
upon them. And</P>
<P N="1">1. Ob&s;erve, that the unnatural and pre|po&s;terous
Order of Time, in which the&s;e
Miracles are related, ju&s;tly brings them all
under &s;u&s;picion of Fable and Forgery.
The greate&s;t of the three is indi&s;putably
that of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Re&s;urrection; but &s;ince
this is only mention'd by St. <HI>John,</HI> who
wrote his Go&s;pel after the other <HI>Evange|li&s;ts,</HI>
and above &s;ixty Years, according to
the be&s;t Computation, after our Lord's
A&s;cen&s;ion; here is too much Room for
Cavil and Que&s;tion, whether this Story be
not entirely his Invention. What could
be the Rea&s;on that <HI>Matthew,</HI><HI>Mark,</HI> and
<HI>Luke,</HI> who all wrote their Go&s;pels before
<HI>John,</HI> and many Years nearer to the
Death of our Saviour, &s;hould omit to re|cord
this remarkable and mo&s;t illu&s;trious
Miracle of <HI>Lazarus?</HI> They could not for|get
it, nor be ignorant of it, if the Story
had been really true: and to a&s;&s;ign any
<PB N="7" REF="14">
other Rea&s;on than Ignorance or Forgetful|ne&s;s,
is hard and impo&s;&s;ible. To aggran|dize
the Fame of their Ma&s;ter, for a Worker
of Miracles, was the De&s;ign of all the <HI>Evan|geli&s;ts,</HI>
e&s;pecially of the three fir&s;t, who
may be pre&s;umed to make a Report of
the greate&s;t, if not of all, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
wrought: But that there &s;hould come
after them an <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> with an huge and
&s;uperlatively great Miracle, and meet with
Credit for it, is again&s;t all Sen&s;e and Rea|&s;on;
neither is there any Story, &s;o di&s;or|derly
told, in all Hi&s;tory, that <HI>Critics</HI> will
admit of the Belief of. The fir&s;t Writer
of the Life of an <HI>Hero,</HI> to be &s;ure makes
mention of all the grand Occurrences of
it, and leaves no Room for <HI>Biographers</HI> af|terwards,
but to enlarge and paraphra&s;e
upon what he has written, with &s;ome
other Circum&s;tances and Additions of le&s;s
Moment. If a third or a fourth <HI>Biogra|pher</HI>
after him &s;hall pre&s;ume to add a more
illu&s;trious Tran&s;action of the <HI>Hero</HI>'s Life,
it will be rejected as Fable and Romance,
tho' for no other Rea&s;on than this, that the
fir&s;t Writer mu&s;t have been appris'd of it,
and would have in&s;erted its Story, if there
had been any Truth in it. And whether
St. <HI>John</HI>'s Story of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Re&s;urrection,
that Miracle of Miracles, ought not to be
&s;ubjected to the like Critici&s;m upon it,
<PB N="8" REF="15">
<HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> may con&s;ider, and <HI>Infidels</HI> will
judge.</P>
<P>What then was the Rea&s;on, I ask again,
that the three fir&s;t <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> neglected to
record this renown'd Miracle of <HI>Lazarus?</HI>
And why too (may I enquire here) did
not <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Mark</HI> mention the Story
of the Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son, as they
could not but know of it, if true, more
certainly than <HI>Luke,</HI> the Companion of
<HI>Paul,</HI> who alone has made a Report of
it? <HI>Grotius</HI> &s;ays, <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Mirum videri pote&s;t Hi&s;toriam hanc tam illu&s;trem a Matthae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> &amp; Marco omi&s;&s;am. <HI>In Loc. Luc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>it may &s;eem &s;trange
that this illu&s;trious Miracle of the Widow's
Son</HI> was omitted by <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Mark</HI>:
And what is the Rea&s;on that <HI>Grotius</HI> gives
for this &s;trange Omi&s;&s;ion? Why, he tells
us <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Sed videtur mihi horum uter&abque; contentus fui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters"> uno Exemplo redditae Vitae in Jairi filia ex quo &s;imilia alia po&s;&s;unt intelligi. <HI>In Loc. Luc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>that the&s;e two Evangeli&s;ts were
content with one miraculous In&s;tance of this
Kind, by which Chri&s;tians might judge of</HI>
Je&s;us'<HI>s Power in others al&s;o.</HI> And is this
Rea&s;on &s;ufficient? True it is, they were
content with one In&s;tance; but if they
had made a Report of two or three more
of the &s;ame &s;ort, no body would have
thought their Hi&s;tory of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> overcharg'd
with impertinent and tautological Repeti|tions.
<PB N="9" REF="16">
But one In&s;tance of a Per&s;on rais'd
from the dead, they were, &s;ays <HI>Grotius,</HI>
content with: And I'll grant one to be
&s;ufficient: But which then &s;hould they, as
wi&s;e and con&s;iderate <HI>Hi&s;torians</HI> have made
Choice of, the greate&s;t or the lea&s;t Mira|cle?
The greate&s;t, to be &s;ure, and that
was of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> or of the Widow's Son,
if they knew of either. But in&s;tead of ei|ther
of the&s;e, they tell us the Story of <HI>Jai|rus</HI>'s
Daughter, that is <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">Nondum perfecta Mors e&s;t in Puella. <HI>St. Augu&s;t.</HI> in Serm. xcviii.</NOTE> an imperfect
and di&s;putable Miracle, in Compari&s;on of
the other two, which con&s;equently they
knew nothing at all of, or they would have
preferr'd the Report of them.</P>
<P>If <HI>Matthew,</HI> the fir&s;t Writer, had re|corded
only the Story of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> who&s;e
Re&s;urrection was the greate&s;t Miracle;
and if <HI>Luke</HI> had added <HI>that</HI> of the Wi|dow
of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son; and <HI>John</HI> la&s;tly had
remember'd us of <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter, which
the other <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> not through Igno|rance
or Forgetfulne&s;s, but &s;tudying Bre|vity,
had omitted, then all had been
well; and no Objection had hence lain
again&s;t the Credit of any of the&s;e Mira|cles,
or again&s;t the Authority of the <HI>E|vangeli&s;ts:</HI>
But this unnatural and pre|po&s;terous
<PB N="10" REF="17">
Order of Time, in which the&s;e
Miracles are recorded (the greate&s;t being
po&s;tponed to the lea&s;t) admini&s;ters ju&s;t
Occa&s;ion of &s;u&s;picion of the Truth and
Credibility of all their Stories. And it is
lucky for Chri&s;tianity, that <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>In|fidels</HI>
have not hitherto hit upon the <HI>Ab&s;ur|dity</HI>
of this prepo&s;terous Narration, or
they might have form'd a cogent Ob|jection
again&s;t the&s;e Miracles thus, &s;ay|ing;</P>
<P>"<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> it is manife&s;t, rais'd not the
dead at all. The only Per&s;on, that
Chri&s;tians can rea&s;onably pretend, he
did rai&s;e, was <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter, whom
<HI>Matthew</HI> writes of; and &s;he, according
to the Story was only in a Sleep, or an
Extacy, when <HI>Je&s;us</HI> revived her. But
the <HI>Galileans,</HI> who were after a Time
call'd <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> finding their Account
in a Re&s;urrection-Miracle; <HI>Luke,</HI> for
the former Advantage of the Cau&s;e, de|vi&s;ed
another Story of better Circum|&s;tances,
in the Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son:
But this not being &s;o great a Miracle, as
the Church &s;till wanted; <HI>John,</HI> when
no body was alive to contradict and ex|po&s;tulate
with him for it, trumps up a
long Story of a thumping Miracle, in
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s rai&s;ing of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> who had
been not only dead, but buried &s;o long
<PB N="11" REF="18">
that he &s;tank again. But to prove the
Story of this Miracle to be fal&s;e and fa|bulous,
we need &s;ay no more than that
it was la&s;t recorded. If there had been
any Truth in it, the fir&s;t <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI>
would have remember'd us of it.</P>
<P>"We don't &s;uppo&s;e, that you Chri&s;tians,
becau&s;e of your Prejudices, will &s;ub|&s;cribe
to this Account, that we thus
give of the Ri&s;e of the&s;e Miracles: But
this is certain, that if the&s;e three Mira|cles
had not been reported of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI>
but of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> in the &s;ame di&s;order of
Time, by three different Hi&s;torians,
you would pre&s;ently have &s;cented the
Forgery and Impo&s;ture: You would
ju&s;tly have affirm'd that the three Stories
were apparently three Fables and Fal&s;|hoods;
and that the three Hi&s;torians
vi&s;ibly &s;trove to out&s;tretch each other:
That the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> was &s;paring and mode&s;t in
his Romance; and the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> being &s;en|&s;ible
of the In&s;ufficiency of the former's
Tale, devi&s;es a Miracle of a bigger
Size; which &s;till not proving &s;ufficient to
the End propo&s;ed; the <HI>third</HI> Writer,
rather than his Prophet's Honour &s;hould
&s;ink for want of a Re&s;urrection-Miracle,
forges a Story of a mon&s;trou&s;ly huge
one; again&s;t which it is, and always will
be Objection enough, that it was not
<PB N="12" REF="19">
related by the fir&s;t Hi&s;torian. So would
you Chri&s;tians argue again&s;t the&s;e three
Miracles in another Impo&s;tor's Ca&s;e;
and there is not a judicious <HI>Critic</HI> in the
Univer&s;e, that would not approve of
the Argument, and applaud the Force
of it, tho' you will not endure the
Thoughts of it in the Ca&s;e of your
<HI>Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>"But to come nearer home to you;
&s;uppo&s;ing <HI>John</HI> (who was then above a
Hundred, and in his Dotage) had not
reported this Miracle of <HI>Lazarus</HI>; but
that <HI>Clement</HI> (joining it with his <NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">In Epi&s;t. prima ad Corinth. Cap. xxv.</NOTE> in|credible
Story of the Re&s;urrection of a
<HI>Phaenix</HI>) or <HI>Ignatius,</HI> or <HI>Polycarp,</HI> or the
Author of the <HI>Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions</HI>
had related it; would not your Chri&s;|tian
<HI>Critics</HI> have been at work to ex|plode
it? There is not an antient extra|evangelical
Tradition of any Note about
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> that &s;ome or other of your <HI>Cri|tics</HI>
have not boggled at; but &s;uch a
Story as this of <HI>Lazarus</HI> would have
been received by none. I que&s;tion,
whether Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> would not have
rejected the <HI>Con&s;titutions</HI> upon &s;uch a
Story in them; or if his Fancy for &s;ome
other Things in them had overcome his
<PB N="13" REF="20">
Rea&s;on again&s;t this; yet <HI>Bi&s;hop Small-|broke,</HI>
who has written again&s;t the Ca|nonicalne&s;s
of the <HI>Con&s;titutions,</HI> with
his judicious Animadver&s;ions upon this
Story, would ab&s;olutely have over|thrown
their Authority. And what
would he have &s;aid here? Not only
that the Miracle &s;mells rankly of Forge|ry
and Fraud, or the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> e&s;peci|cially
<HI>Matthew,</HI> had never forgotten to
record it; but he would have reminded
us of intrin&s;ic Notes (<HI>hereafter to be men|tion'd</HI>)
of Ab&s;urdity, and Incredibility,
that would for ever have ca&s;hier'd the
Belief of it. And whether we <HI>Infidels</HI>
ought not to take the &s;ame Liberty to
criticize on <HI>John</HI>'s Go&s;pel, which you
do on your Apo&s;tolical Fathers, who
wrote before him, let the impartial and
unprejudiced judge: If in ju&s;tice we
ought to take it; we are &s;ure we could
give two or three notable Rea&s;ons (but
that We will not now put Chri&s;tians
out of Temper with them) why <HI>John</HI>
may be &s;u&s;pected of a Mi&s;take or Fraud
in this Miracle, rather than any other
Chri&s;tian Writer of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> or <HI>&s;econd</HI>
Century."</P>
<P>To &s;uch an unhappy Objection, ari&s;ing
from the unnatural and prepo&s;terous Order
of Time, in which they are recorded,
<PB N="14" REF="21">
are the&s;e three Miracles before us obnoxi|ous.
And I am thinking how Mini&s;ters of
the Letter will be able to get over it. As
for my &s;elf, who am for the my&s;tical Inter|pretation
of the&s;e Miracles, I have a &s;olid
and &s;ub&s;tantial An&s;wer at hand to the fore|&s;aid
Objection, an An&s;wer that curiou&s;ly
accounts for the Order of Time in which
the&s;e Miracles are related; but my An&s;wer
will not plea&s;e our <HI>Divines,</HI> nor &s;tand them
in any &s;tead; therefore they mu&s;t look up
another good one of their own, that will
comport with the <HI>Letter</HI>; or the &s;aid Ob|jection,
improved with another pre&s;ently
again&s;t <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Re&s;urrection, will be too
hard, not for Chri&s;tianity it &s;elf, but for
their Mini&s;try.</P>
<P><HI>Grotius,</HI> being aware of the fore&s;aid

But how weak and in&s;ufficient both their

<P N="2">2. Second Ob&s;ervation, by Way of Ob|jection
to the <HI>Letter</HI> of the&s;e Miracles, and
that is, by enquiring, what became of
the&s;e three Per&s;ons after their Re&s;urrection?
How long did they live afterwards? And
of what U&s;e and Advantage were their
re&s;tored <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">ives to the Church or to Man|kind?
The Evangelical and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Hi&s;tory is entirely &s;ilent as to the&s;e Que&s;|tions,
which is enough to make us &s;u&s;pect
their Stories to be merely romantick or
parabolical; and that there were no &s;uch
Per&s;ons rais'd from the dead; or we mu&s;t
have heard &s;omewhat of their Station and
<PB N="16" REF="23">
Conver&s;ation in the World afterwards.
It's true, that <HI>Ephiphanius</HI> <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">Quin &amp; illud inter traditiones reperimus triginta tum Annos natum fui&s;&s;e Lazaru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, cum a mortuis excitatus e&s;t; at&abque; idem ille po&s;tea triginta aliis annis vixit. <HI>In Haere&s;.</HI> lxvi. <HI>Sect.</HI> 34.</NOTE> &s;ays, what
he found among Traditions, that <HI>Lazarus</HI>
lived thirty Years after his Re&s;urrection:
But how did he &s;pend his Time all that
while? Was it to the Honour of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI>
to the Service of the Church, and Proga|gation
of the Go&s;pel? Of that we know
nothing; tho in Rea&s;on and Gratitude to
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> his Benefactor, it ought to have
been &s;o &s;pent; and if it had been &s;o em|ploy'd,
Hi&s;tory &s;urely would have inform'd
us of it. According to the Opinion of
<HI>Grotius,</HI> in a Citation above, <HI>Lazarus</HI> for
the re&s;t of his re&s;tored Life ab&s;conded, and
skull'd about the Country for Fear of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> who lay in Wait for him; which is
a Sugge&s;tion, not only di&s;honourable to
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as if the &s;ame Power, that rais'd
him from the dead, could not protect him
again&s;t his Enemies; but reproachful to
<HI>Lazarus</HI> him&s;elf, who &s;hould have cho&s;en
to &s;uffer Death again, rather than not bear
an open Te&s;timony to <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the Author
of his Re&s;urrection. However it was, we
hear no more of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> than that he
lived thirty Years afterwards, which Tra|dition,
<PB N="17" REF="24">
without other Memorials of his
Life, brings the Miracle more under &s;u&s;pi|cion
of Fable, than if he had dy'd &s;oon
after it. And of <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter, and of
the Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son, which is a&s;to|ni&s;hing,
we read nothing at all. Does not
this Silence in Hi&s;tory about them, make
their Miracles que&s;tionable, and but like
<HI>Gulliverian</HI> Tales of Per&s;ons and Things,
that out of the Romance, never had any
Being.</P>
<P><HI>Je&s;us</HI> did but <NOTE N="16" PLACE="foot">Matt. xviii. 2.</NOTE> <HI>call a little Child, and
&s;et him in the mid&s;t</HI> of his Di&s;ciples; and
that Act was remember'd in the Piety and
Zeal <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">In Nicephor. Calli&s;t. Eccl. Hi&s;t. L. ii. c. 35.</NOTE> of <HI>Ignatius,</HI> who made a re|nown'd
Bi&s;hop. But the Favour and Ble&s;|&s;ing
conferr'd on the&s;e three rais'd Per&s;ons
was exceedingly greater; and one might
have expected, that <HI>Lazarus</HI> and the Wi|dow's
Son would have been eminent Mi|ni&s;ters
of the Go&s;pel. But in&s;tead of that,
their Lives afterwards were pa&s;s'd in Ob|&s;curity,
or, what's as bad, Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Hi&s;tory has neglected a Report of them.
What can any one hereupon think le&s;s,
than that the Favour of the Miracles was
lo&s;t on unde&s;erving Per&s;ons, which I ab|hor
the Thoughts of; or that their Stories
<PB N="18" REF="25">
are but Parables, which I rather incline to.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Letter</HI> may here &s;ay,
"That the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory of the A|po&s;tolical
Age is very &s;canty; and that
many Memorials of other Per&s;ons and
Tran&s;actions are lo&s;t and buried in Ob|livion:
Which unhappy Fate has at|tended
the after-Lives and Actions of
the&s;e rais'd Per&s;ons, or undoubtedly we
&s;hould have had a famous Record of
them." This is not impo&s;&s;ible; tho'
in the Wi&s;dom of Providence it is hardly
probable, but that &s;ome more Remem|brance
mu&s;t have been left of one or o|ther,
if not of all the three Per&s;ons; in as
much as &s;uch a Remembrance of them
would now-a-days have no le&s;s gain'd a
Belief of the Miracles, than this Hi&s;torical
Silence tends to the Di&s;credit of them.</P>
<P>It's &s;omewhat &s;trange, that we hear no
more of the after-Fame and Life of any
of the di&s;ea&s;ed Per&s;ons, whom <HI>Je&s;us</HI> mi|raculou&s;ly
cured; excepting of the Wo|man,
heal'd of an I&s;&s;ue of Blood; who,
tho' &s;he <HI>&s;pent</HI> ALL <HI>&s;he had, even</HI> ALL
<HI>her Living</HI> upon <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI>; yet out of
the Remains of it erected, &s;ays <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">In Eccl. Hi&s;t. L. vii. c. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Eu|&s;ebius,</HI>
at <HI>Cae&s;area Philippi,</HI> two mo&s;t co&s;t|ly
Statues of Bra&s;s, to the Memory of
<PB N="19" REF="26">
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> and of her&s;elf, and of the Miracle
wrought by him; which Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> <NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">In Loc. Matthaei.</NOTE>
as if he was tainted with Infidelity, endea|vours
to make an idle Tale of. But ex|cepting,
I &s;ay this Story of this Woman,
we hear nothing of any other heal'd Per|&s;on;
which is Matter of &s;ome Specula|tion:
But that the Per&s;ons rais'd from
the dead &s;hould not at all be mention'd
in Hi&s;tory for their Labours and Lives
afterwards to the Honour of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> is ab|&s;olutely
unaccountable. Whether &s;uch a
profound Silence in Hi&s;tory about them be
not &s;hocking of the Credit of the Mira|cles,
let our <HI>Divines</HI> con&s;ider. I am of
Opinion that if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> really rais'd the&s;e Per|&s;ons
from the dead; this and no other Rea|&s;on,
in the Providence of God, can be gi|ven
for the Silence of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;to|ry
about them afterwards, than to make
<HI>dead-letter'd</HI> Stories of their Miracles, in
order to turn our Heads entirely to the
Con&s;ideration of their my&s;tical Significa|tion,
without which the <HI>Letter,</HI> for the
Argument before us, is de&s;erving of no
Regard nor Credit. But</P>
<P N="3">3. By way of Objection to the <HI>Letter</HI>
of the&s;e three Miracles, let us con&s;ider the
<PB N="20" REF="27">
Condition of the Per&s;ons rais'd from the
dead; and whether they were at all pro|per
Per&s;ons for <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to work &s;uch a Mi|racle
upon, in Te&s;timony of his divine
Power. If they were improper Per&s;ons
according to the <HI>Letter,</HI> it's not credible
that He, who was the Wi&s;dom of God,
would rai&s;e them; or if he did, it was
becau&s;e they were the propere&s;t to make
my&s;tical Emblems of their Stories.</P>
<P>That <HI>Je&s;us</HI> ought to have rais'd all that
dy'd, where-ever he came, during the
Time of his Mini&s;try, none, I pre&s;ume,
can hold. Two or three In&s;tances of his
almighty and miraculous Power of this
Kind will be allow'd to be &s;ufficient:
But then they mu&s;t be wi&s;ely and judici|ou&s;ly
made Choice of, out of a va&s;t Num|ber
of Per&s;ons, that mu&s;t needs die in
that Time. Where then was his Wi&s;dom
and Prudence to chu&s;e the&s;e three Per&s;ons
above others to that Honour? Why were
all of them, or indeed any one of them
preferr'd to other Per&s;ons of a different
Age and Condition in the World? Nay,
if the <HI>Letter</HI> of their Stories is only to be
regarded, were not all the&s;e three Per|&s;ons
almo&s;t the impropere&s;t and mo&s;t un|fit
of any for <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to exerci&s;e that Power
on?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="28">
<HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter was an in&s;ignificant
<HI>Girl</HI> of twelve Years old: And there
could be no Rea&s;on for rai&s;ing her, but to
wipe Sorrow from the Hearts, and Tears
from the Eyes of her Parents, who ought
to have been better Philo&s;ophers, than im|moderately
to grieve for her. And was
here a good Rea&s;on for <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to interpo&s;e
with his Almighty Powe? No certainly;
a Lecture of Patience and Re&s;ignation in
this Ca&s;e had been enough. And tho
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> could rai&s;e her from the dead; yet
for as much as that Favour was to be con|ferr'd
but on a few; and his Miracles
ought to be u&s;eful as well as con&s;picuous,
&s;he &s;hould have been pa&s;s'd by, as an im|proper
Object of his Power, in Compari|&s;on
of many others, pre&s;ently to be na|med.
If therefore a better Rea&s;on, than
what's di&s;cernible in the <HI>Letter,</HI> is not to
be fetch'd from the My&s;tery; I can't &s;up|po&s;e
that <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the Wi&s;dom of God would
rai&s;e this <HI>Girl</HI>; but that the modern Be|leif
of her Re&s;u&s;citation, exclu&s;ive of the
my&s;tical Signification, is, as &s;hall be by and
by argued, altogether groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>The Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son too was
but a <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Youth,</HI> and whether any
thing older than the <HI>Girl</HI> above is doubt|ful;
but his Life certainly was of no
more Importance to the World after, than
<PB N="22" REF="29">
before his Re&s;urrection. And why was
he then one of the <HI>three</HI> to be rais'd from
the dead? Why had he this Honour done
him, before others of greater Age, Worth,
and U&s;e to MankInd? Some will &s;ay, for
the Comfort of his &s;orrowful Mother.
And is this Rea&s;on &s;ufficient? A Di&s;cour&s;e
on the Plea&s;ures of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Bo&s;om,
where &s;he would e'er long meet her Son,
had been enough to chear her Heart. If
therefore the Fathers don't help me to a
&s;olid my&s;tical Rea&s;on, why the Son and
<HI>only Son</HI> of a Widow was to be rais'd by
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> as they were carrying him to his Bu|rial,
I'll not believe, He would rai&s;e this
dead <HI>Boy</HI> rather than many others, for the
Manife&s;tation of his Power; but that the
Story of his Re&s;urrection, as &s;hall &s;oon be
rea&s;onably proved, was all Sham and Cheat.</P>
<P><HI>Lazarus</HI> indeed was <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Friend,
whom he Loved; and as I will not que|&s;tion
but <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Affection was wi&s;ely and
de&s;ervedly placed on him; &s;o here, to
Appearance, was a better Rea&s;on for the
rai&s;ing of him, than of either of the other
Two. But even this Rea&s;on, &s;uppo&s;ing
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> was to rai&s;e but three Per&s;ons, is
not &s;ufficient again&s;t the Ca&s;es of many
others, that may be put for the Mani|fe&s;tation
of his Power, for the Illu&s;tration
of his Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, and for the
<PB N="23" REF="30">
Conver&s;ion of Unbelievers: Con&s;equently,
if this Story of <HI>Lazarus</HI> be not parabolical,
the litteral Fact is di&s;putable, and obnoxi|ous
to &s;uch Exceptions pre&s;ently to be ob|&s;erved
again&s;t it, as will not be ea&s;ily got
over.</P>
<P><HI>Je&s;us</HI> rais'd the dead, and wrought o|ther
Miracles, &s;ay our <HI>Divines</HI> often, not
only to manife&s;t his own Power and Glo|ry,
but his Love to Mankind, and his
Inclination to do them good: For which
Rea&s;on his Miracles are u&s;eful and bene|ficial
as well as &s;tupendous and &s;upernatu|ral
Acts, on purpo&s;e to conciliate Men's
Affections as well as their Faith to him.
On this Topick our <HI>Divines</HI> are copious
and rhetorical, when they write on <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
Miracles, as if no more u&s;eful and won|derful
Works could be done, than what
he did. And I do agree with them, that
(what Rea&s;on be&s;peaks) the Miracles of a
pretended Author of Religion ought to be
both as u&s;eful and great as well as could
be. But &s;uch were not <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Miracles
according to <HI>Letter,</HI> and lea&s;t of all his Acts
of rai&s;ing the dead. For if we con&s;ider
the Per&s;ons rais'd by him, we &s;hall find,
he could hardly have exerted his Power
on any of le&s;s Importance to the World,
both before and after their Re&s;urrection.
A young <HI>Girl</HI> indeed is fitter to be rais'd
<PB N="24" REF="31">
than a decripid old Woman, who by the
Cour&s;e of Nature was to return to Cor|ruption
again, as &s;oon as re&s;tored to Life:
And a <HI>Boy</HI> rather than an infirm old Man
for the &s;ame Rea&s;on: And <HI>Lazarus</HI> the
Friend of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> perhaps, and but perhaps,
rather than his profe&s;s'd Enemy. But
what are the&s;e three Per&s;ons in Compari|&s;on
of many others of other Circum|&s;tances?
In&s;tead of a <HI>Boy,</HI> and a <HI>Girl</HI> and
even of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> who were all of no
Con&s;equence to the Publick, either before
or &s;ince; I &s;hould think, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> ought to
have rais'd an u&s;eful Magi&s;trate, who&s;e
Life had beed a common Ble&s;&s;ing; an in|du&s;trious
Merchant, who&s;e Death was a
publick Lo&s;s; a Father of a numerous
Family, which for a comfortable Sub&s;i&s;t|ance
depended on him. Such dead Ob|jects
of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Power and Compa&s;&s;ion
could not but offer them&s;elves, during the
Time of his Mini&s;try, and if he meant to
be as u&s;eful as he could, in his Miracles,
he would have laid hold on them. If a
few Per&s;ons only were to be rais'd from
the dead, the fore&s;aid were the propere&s;t,
who&s;e Re&s;urrection and Return to Life
would have begotten the Applau&s;e as well
as the Wonder of the World; would
mo&s;t exten&s;ively have &s;pread <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Fame;
and would have gain'd him the Love and
<PB N="25" REF="32">
Di&s;ciple&s;hip of all that heard of his being
&s;o great a Benefactor to Mankind. Such
In&s;tances of his Power would have de|mon&s;trated
him to be a mo&s;t benign as
well as a mighty Agent; and none in In|tere&s;t
or Prejudice could have open'd their
Mouths again&s;t him, e&s;pecially if the Per|&s;ons
rais'd from the dead were &s;elected
upon the Recommendation of the People
of this or that City. But that an in&s;igni|ficant
<HI>Boy</HI> and a <HI>Girl,</HI> (for&s;ooth!) and the
ob&s;cure <HI>Lazarus,</HI> are preferr'd by <HI>Je&s;us,</HI>
to &s;uch publick and more de&s;erving Per|&s;ons
is unaccountable. Their Story there|fore,
upon this Argument, &s;avours of Ro|mance
and Fraud; and unle&s;s the <HI>My&s;tery</HI>
help us to, what the <HI>Letter</HI> can't, a good
Rea&s;on for <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Conduct here, the Mi|racles
may be hence ju&s;tly que&s;tion'd, and
the Credibility of their Report di&s;puted.</P>
<P>But now I am &s;peaking of the Fitne&s;s
and Unfitne&s;s of decea&s;ed Per&s;ons to have
this grand Miracle wrought on them; it
comes into my Head to ask, why <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
rais'd not <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t to Life again?
A Per&s;on of greater Merits, and more
worthy of the Favour of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> and of
this Miracle, could not be. If <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
could rai&s;e any from the dead he would
&s;urely have rai&s;ed him; and why did he
not? This is a rea&s;onable Que&s;tion, and an
<PB N="26" REF="33">
An&s;wer &s;hould be thought on for it. Was
it a Thing out of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Power? Not &s;o;
He was Omnipotent, and could by Force
or Per&s;ua&s;ion have re&s;cued <HI>John</HI>'s Head out
of the Hands of his Enemies; and the
tacking it again to his Body, and the infu|&s;ing
new Life into him was no more dif|ficult
to <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> than the Re&s;u&s;citation of a
&s;tinking Carca&s;s. If <HI>Je&s;us</HI> had here exer|ted
his Power, and rais'd his deare&s;t Friend
and choice&s;t Mini&s;ter for the Preparation,
if not Propagation of the Go&s;pel, none
could que&s;tion his Ability to rai&s;e any
others, tho he had rais'd no more. But
in as much as <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> one of his
&s;ingular Merits and Services to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> was
overlook'd and neglected by him; and
three u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant Per&s;ons had
this Honour done them, the Facts may rea|&s;onably
be called into que&s;tion, and, if
the My&s;teries don't &s;olve the Difficulty,
their litteral Stories may hence be account|ed
fooli&s;h, fictitious and fabulous; e&s;peci|ally
if we con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="4">4. That none of the&s;e three rais'd Per|&s;ons
had been long enough dead to ampu|tate
all Doubt of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s miraculous
Power in their Re&s;urrection. As to <HI>Jairus</HI>'s
Daughter, &s;he was but newly expired, if
at all dead, when <HI>Je&s;us</HI> brought her to
<PB N="27" REF="34">
Life again. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> him&s;elf &s;ays, &s;he was
but a&s;leep. And according to <HI>Theophanes
Cerameus</HI> <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Puellam ex illo Tumultu plangentium &s;tupore cor|reptam e&s;&s;e, non vero defunctam. <HI>In Homil. de Juri filia.</HI></NOTE>, and <HI>Theophilact</HI> <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">In Loc. Matthae.</NOTE> there
is Room to &s;u&s;pect that this <HI>Girl</HI> was only
<GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>be&s;ide her&s;elf.</HI> And it is not im|po&s;&s;ible,
but the pa&s;&s;ionate Skreams of the
Feminine By-&s;tanders might fright her into
Fits, that bore the Appearance of Death;
otherwi&s;e why did <HI>Je&s;us</HI> turn the&s;e inor|dinate
Weepers out of the Hou&s;e, before
he could bring her to her Sen&s;es again? And
why did he tell her Parents, that &s;he was
only in a&s;leep, but to Comfort them with
the Po&s;&s;ibility of his awakening her out of it?
Is not this de&s;tructive of the Miracle, and
making no more of it, than what another
Man might do? And is there not &s;ome
Probability, that here's all of this Story?
But &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he was really dead, yet for
the &s;ake of an indi&s;putable Miracle in her
Re&s;urrection, it mu&s;t be granted, that &s;he
ought to have been much longer, &s;ome
Days if not Weeks, dead and buried.</P>
<P>As to the Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son, there
was &s;omewhat more of the Appearance of
Death in him, than in <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter.
He was carried forth to his Burial, and &s;o
may be pre&s;umed to be really a dead
<PB N="28" REF="35">
Corp&s;e. But might not here be Fraud or
Mi&s;take in the Ca&s;e? Hi&s;tory and com|mon
Fame affords In&s;tances of the mi&s;ta|ken
Deaths of Per&s;ons, who &s;ometimes
have been unfortunately buried alive, and
at other Times happily, by one Means or
other, re&s;tored to Life: And who knows
but <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> upon &s;ome Information or
other, might &s;u&s;pect this Youth to be
in a lethargick State, and had a Mind to
try, if by chafeing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he could not do,
what &s;ucce&s;sfully he did, bring him to his
Sen&s;es again: Or might not a Piece of
Fraud be here concerted between <HI>Je&s;us,</HI>
a &s;ubtil Youth, and his Mother and others;
and all the Formalities of a Death and Bu|rial
contrived, that <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who&s;e Fame for
a Worker of Miracles was to be rais'd,
might here have an Opportunity to make a
&s;hew of a grand one. The Mourning of
the Widow, who had her Tears at Com|mand
and <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s ca&s;ual meeting of the
Corp&s;e upon the Road, looks like Contri|vance
to put the better Face upon the
Matter. God forbid, that I &s;hould &s;u&s;|pect,
there was any Fraud of this Kind
here; but of the Po&s;&s;ibility of it, none
can doubt. And where there is a Po&s;|&s;ibility
of Fraud, it is Non&s;en&s;e, and
mere Credulity to talk of a real, certain
and &s;tupendous Miracle, e&s;pecially where
<PB N="29" REF="36">
the Juggler and pretended Worker of Mi|racles
has been detected in &s;ome of his
other Tricks. All that I have to &s;ay here
to this Matter, is, that if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> had a
Mind to rai&s;e the Son of this Widow, in
Te&s;timony of his divine Power, he &s;hould
have &s;uffer'd him to have been buried two
or three Weeks fir&s;t; otherwi&s;e, if the
My&s;tery don't account for <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s &s;topping
the Bearers of the Corp&s;e upon the Road,
here is too much Room for &s;u&s;picion of
Cheat in the Letter of the Story.</P>
<P><HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Ca&s;e &s;eems to be the le&s;s excep|tionable
of the three. He had been buried
<HI>four Days,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;ed to be putrified in
the Opinion of his Si&s;ter <HI>Mary,</HI> and of mo|dern
Chri&s;tians: And if &s;o, his Re&s;u&s;cita|tion
was a mo&s;t grand and indi&s;putable
Miracle. And I could have wi&s;h'd, if I
had not loved the <HI>My&s;tery</HI> rather than
the <HI>Letter,</HI> that no Cavil and Exception
could have been made to it. Whether <HI>La|zarus,</HI>
who was <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Friend and beloved
Di&s;ciple, would not come into Mea&s;ures
with his Lord, for the Defence of his Ho|nour,
and Propagation of his Fame, <HI>Infi|dels,</HI>
who take Chri&s;tianity for an Impo&s;|ture,
will not que&s;tion: And whether he
would not con&s;ent to be interr'd alive, in
a hollow Cave, where there was only a
Stone laid at the Mouth of it, as long as
<PB N="30" REF="37">
a Man could fa&s;t, none of them will doubt.
Four Days was almo&s;t too long for a Man
to fa&s;t without danger of Health; but if
tho&s;e <HI>four Days</HI> are number'd according to
the Arithmetick of Je&s;us'<HI>s three Days</HI> in his
Grave, they are reducible to two Days and
three Nights, which Time, if no Victuals
were &s;ecretly convey'd with him, a Man
might fa&s;t in <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Cave. As to the
<HI>&s;tinking</HI> of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Carca&s;s: that, <HI>Infidels</HI>
will &s;ay, was but the A&s;&s;ertion of his Si&s;ter
beforehand, like a Prologue to a Farce.
None of the Spectators at his Re&s;urrection
&s;ay one Word of his &s;tinking. And as to
the Weepings and Lamentations of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
and of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Si&s;ters, they will &s;ay
that was all Sham and Counterfeit, the
better to carry on the Juggle of a feign'd
Re&s;urrection. And what's wor&s;t of all,
they will &s;ay, that tho <HI>Je&s;us</HI> did call <HI>La|zarus</HI>
forth with a <HI>loud Voice,</HI> as if he had
been as deaf as a dead Man; yet his <HI>Face
was bound about with a Napkin,</HI> &s;o that
the Spectators could not di&s;cern what was
of the E&s;&s;ence of the Miracle, the Change
of his Countenance from a dead to a live
one, which is a plain Sign, that it was all
Fraud and Impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>God forbid, that I &s;hould have the &s;ame
&s;en&s;e with <HI>Infidels,</HI> of this Matter; but to
be ju&s;t to their Sugge&s;tions and Imagina|tions
<PB N="31" REF="38">
here, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, there are &s;ome
other unhappy Circum&s;tances, pre&s;ently to
be con&s;ider'd, in this Story, which, if they
are not emblematical, make it the mo&s;t
notorious Cheat and Impo&s;ture that ever
was put upon Mankind. In the mean
Time, from what is here argued, it is
plain, that <HI>Lazarus</HI> was not &s;o long dead
and buried, as that there is no Room to
doubt of the Miracle of his Re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>Now whether the&s;e Arguments again&s;t
the&s;e three Miracles, drawn from the
Shortne&s;s of the Time, in which the&s;e
Per&s;ons lay for dead, have any Force in
them, let our <HI>Divines</HI> con&s;ider. If no|thing
of all this is in their Opinion affect|ing
of the Credit of the Miracles; yet
they mu&s;t allow, that <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> if he could
rai&s;e the dead, might have made Choice of
other In&s;tances of Per&s;ons, more unque&s;ti|onably
dead, who had lain longer in their
Graves, and were in a vi&s;ible State of Putre|faction.
And if this grand Miracle of rai&s;ing
the dead was to be wrought by <HI>Je&s;us</HI> for
the Manife&s;tation of his Glory, and in
Te&s;timony of his Authority; he &s;hould
have exerci&s;ed his Power on &s;ome &s;uch
Per&s;ons, nominated by the Magi&s;trates of
this or that City, who with the People
&s;hould be pre&s;ent at the miraculous Ope|ration,
beholding the putrified Bodies,
<PB N="32" REF="39">
(without a Napkin before their Faces) and
how they were &s;uddenly enliven'd and in|vigorated
with new Fle&s;h, after the Simi|litude
of their pri&s;tine Form, when in
Health and full Strength. Becau&s;e that <HI>Je|&s;us</HI>
rais'd not &s;ome &s;uch Per&s;ons to Life,
I mu&s;t take the Stories of the three Mira|cles
before us to be but typical of more
my&s;terious Works; or believe them for
the Arguments above to be downright
Cheats and Fables. And what is enough
to induce a modern <HI>Divine</HI> to this Opini|on.
Is</P>
<P N="5">5. The Con&s;ideration, that none of
the&s;e rais'd Per&s;ons did or could, after the
Return of their Souls to their Bodies, tell
any Tales of their &s;eparate Exi&s;tence o|therwi&s;e
the Evangeli&s;ts had not been &s;i|lent
in this main Point, which is of the
E&s;&s;ence of Chri&s;tianity. Are not our <HI>Di|vines</HI>
here reduced to an unhappy <HI>Dilemma,</HI>
either to deny the &s;eparate Exi&s;tence of the
Soul, or the precedent Deaths of the&s;e
rais'd Per&s;ons? As Chri&s;tians, we profe&s;s
to believe both, which &s;eemingly are in|compatiable;
or the Evangeli&s;ts had made
&s;uch a Relation, as their return'd Souls had
given of the other World. Was any Per|&s;on,
in this Age, to be rais'd to Life, that
had been any time dead; the fir&s;t Thing
<PB N="33" REF="40">
that his Friends and Acquaintance would
enquire of him, would be to know, where
his Soul had been; in what Company;
and how it had fared with him; and Hi&s;|torians
would certainly record his Narra|tive.
The &s;ame Curio&s;ity could not but
po&s;&s;e&s;s People of old, when the&s;e Miracles
were wrought; and if the rais'd Per&s;ons
had told any Stories of their &s;eparate Ex|i&s;tance,
the Evangeli&s;ts no le&s;s unque&s;|tionally
would have reported them, in as
much as &s;uch a Report would have been,
not only a Confirmation of that Doctrine,
which is of the E&s;&s;ence of our Religion; but
an ab&s;olute Confutation of the <HI>Sadducees</HI>
and <HI>Scepti&s;ts</HI> of that Age, and of the <HI>Ma|teriali&s;ts</HI>
of this. But this their Silence in
this Ca&s;e is of bad Con&s;equence, either to
the Doctrine of the Soul's Exi&s;tence in Se|paration
from the Body, or to the&s;e Mira|cles
them&s;elves, &s;ince we mu&s;t hereupon
almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily hold, that the&s;e rais'd
Per&s;ons were not at all dead, or that their
Souls dy'd with them.</P>
<P>The Author of a Sermon, a&s;crib'd to
St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> tells us <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">Atque ut miraculum divinae Virtutis accre&s;ce|ret, dum Convivis interrogantibus tri&s;tia Loca paena|rum, &s;ede&s;&abque; alta nocte &s;emper ob&s;curas, Lazarus indicat diligenti narratione per ordinem.

St. August.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>Lazarus</HI> af|ter
<PB N="34" REF="41">
his Re&s;urrection made a large Report of
<HI>Hell,</HI> where he had been: But as this is a
mere Fiction of that Author, without the
lea&s;t Authority from Scripture; &s;o I pre|&s;ume
it will be accounted a <HI>Blunder</HI> in
him, to &s;uppo&s;e the Soul of <HI>Lazarus,</HI> the
Friend and beloved of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> was in Hell.
The Soul of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> indeed, for Rea&s;ons be&s;t
known to him&s;elf, upon his Death, de|&s;cended
into Hell, when &s;ome think he
&s;hould rather have gone, with the penitent
Thief, into Paradi&s;e. But the Thoughts,
that any of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Friends &s;hould go to
Hell, I &s;uppo&s;e will not be born with;
or what will become of the Preachers of
this Age, who would be accounted Men
of that Denomination. And if <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s
Soul had been in Paradi&s;e, it was hardly
a good Work in <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to recall it, for thir|ty
Years afterwards, to the Mi&s;eries and
Troubles of this wicked World. I wi&s;h
therefore our <HI>Divines</HI> could determine,
where <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Soul was for the four
Days of his Burial; becau&s;e I can't po&s;&s;i|bly
conceive any thing el&s;e, than that he
was not really dead, or that his Soul dy'd
with him, or went to a bad place, other|wi&s;e
after his Re&s;urrection he had never
<PB N="35" REF="42">
ab&s;conded for fear of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as if he
was unwilling to die again, and return to
the Place from whence he came.</P>
<P>But however it was with the Souls of
the&s;e rais'd Per&s;ons before their Re-union to
their Bodies, here is another Difficulty and
Objection again&s;t the&s;e Miracles; and how
will our <HI>Divines</HI> get over it? Perhaps they
may &s;ay, that tho' the&s;e rais'd Per&s;ons were
before really dead; yet their Souls were
not as yet gone to their Places prepared of
God for them, but continued hovering
about their Bodies, like the Flame about
the Snuff of a Candle, with de&s;ires
<Q><L>&mdash;iterum&abque; reverti</L><L>Corpora&mdash;</L></Q>
to be again rejoin'd to them. And with|all
my Heart let this An&s;wer pa&s;s, if our
<HI>Divines</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> can &s;o agree upon it. As
for my own Opinion, it is this, that the&s;e
Miracles of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> are Parables, and that it
was be&s;ide the Purpo&s;e of the Parable,
and of the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> to &s;ay any thing of
the Place and State of the Soul upon
its Separation from the Body; otherwi&s;e
the Letter of their Stories is manife&s;tly ob|noxious
to the Objection above, or the
Deaths of the&s;e pretended rais'd Per&s;ons,
upon Chri&s;tian Principles, are que&s;tionable.
But</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="36" REF="43">
6. And la&s;tly, Let us con&s;ider the in|trin&s;ick
Ab&s;urdities and Incredibilities of
the &s;everal Stories of the&s;e three Miracles.
And &s;uch Ab&s;urdities &s;hall we find in them,
that, if they had been intended as Te&s;ti|monies
of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s divine Power, had never
been in&s;erted in their Narratives.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter, and her Re&s;ur|rection
from the dead, St. <HI>Hilary</HI> <NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">Princeps hic, Lex e&s;&s;e intelligitur, quae Domi|num orat pro Plebe, quam ip&s;a Chri&s;to praedicata ejus Adventus Expectatione nutriverat, ut Vi tam mortuae reddat. Nam nullum Principem credidi&s;&s;e legimus, ex quo Per&s;ona hujus principis orantis merito in Typum ap|tabitur. <HI>In Loc. Matt.</HI></NOTE>
hints, that there was no &s;uch Per&s;on as
<HI>Jairus</HI> who&s;e Name was fictitious, and
coin'd with a &s;piritual Signification for the
U&s;e of the Parable; and he gives this
Rea&s;on, and a good Rea&s;on it is, why he
thought &s;o, becau&s;e it is el&s;ewhere <NOTE N="24" PLACE="foot">John vii. 48. and xii. 42.</NOTE>
intimated in the Go&s;pel, that none of the
Rulers of the Synagogues confe&s;&s;edly be|lieved
on <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> Is not here then a &s;tum|bling-Block
at the Thre&s;hold of the Let|ter
of this Story? But why did <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;ay,
this Girl was but in a Sleep? If he was
going to work a Miracle in her Re&s;u&s;cita|tion,
he &s;hould not have call'd Death,
<PB N="37" REF="44">
<HI>Sleep</HI>; but if others had been of a contra|ry
Opinion, he &s;hould fir&s;t have convinced
them of the Certainty of her Death, be|fore
he did the great Work on her. And
why did he charge the Parents of the Girl
not to &s;peak of the Miracle? If he meant
it as a Te&s;timony of his divine Power,
he &s;hould rather have exhorted them, in
ju&s;tice to him&s;elf to publi&s;h it, and make
it well known. And why, as St. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI>
 <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">Quae tamen tantae diver&s;itatis Cau&s;a? Supra pub|lice Viduoe filius &s;u&s;citatur, hic removentur plures arbitri. <HI>In Loc. Luc.</HI></NOTE> puts the Que&s;tion, did he turn the
People out of the Hou&s;e, before he would
rai&s;e her? The more Witne&s;&s;es are pre|&s;ent
at a Miracle, the better it is atte&s;ted,
and the more readily believed by others;
and who &s;hould be pre&s;ent at the Miracle
rather than tho&s;e who were incredulous of
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s divine Power? Are not all the&s;e
Circum&s;tances, &s;o many <HI>Ab&s;urdities,</HI> which,
if they are not to be accounted for in the
<HI>My&s;tery,</HI> are &s;o far de&s;tructive of the <HI>Let|ter,</HI>
as that it is Non&s;en&s;e and Folly in our
<HI>Divines</HI> to talk of a Miracle here, again&s;t
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s expre&s;s Word and Prohibition to
the contrary.</P>
<P>As to the Story of the Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s
Son, excepting what is before ob&s;erved of
<PB N="38" REF="45">
the &s;hortne&s;s of the Time, in which he lay
dead, and of the Unfitne&s;s of his Per&s;on
to be rais'd before an Husband and Father
of a Family, to the Comfort of his Wife
and Children, (which are enough to over|throw
the Credility of the Miracle) I have
here no more Fault to find in the Letter
of it.</P>
<P>But the long Story of <HI>Lazarus</HI> is &s;o brim|ful
of Ab&s;urdities, that, if the Letter alone
is to be regarded; St. <HI>John,</HI> who was then
above a hundred, when he wrote it, had
lived beyond his Rea&s;on and Sen&s;es, or he
could not have committed them.</P>
<P>I have not Room here to make Remarks
on all the&s;e Ab&s;urdities, which would be
the Work of a Volume; but &s;hall &s;ingle
out three or four of them at pre&s;ent, re|&s;erving
the re&s;t for another Opportunity,
when the whole Story of this Miracle will
appear to be &s;uch a Contexture of Folly
and Fraud in its Contrivance, Execution,
and Relation, as is not to be equall'd in
all Romantick Hi&s;tory; and our <HI>Divines</HI>
will find them&s;elves &s;o di&s;tre&s;s'd upon the
Di&s;&s;ection and Di&s;play of it, as that they
mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity allow this Story to be
but a Parable; or, what's mo&s;t grievous
to think on, give up their Religion upon
it.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="46">

and Pre&s;ence he can retrieve in an
In&s;tant, as that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;hould &s;hed Tears
for <HI>Lazarus</HI> in this Ca&s;e. If <HI>Je&s;us</HI> could
not or would not rai&s;e him from the dead,
he ought not, as a Philo&s;opher, who knows
Man is born to die, to betray &s;o much
Weakne&s;s as to weep for him. Patience
and Re&s;ignation unto God upon the Death
of our deare&s;t Friends and Relations is
what all Philo&s;ophers have rightly taught;
and <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> one would think, &s;hould have
been the mo&s;t Heroical Example of the&s;e
Graces; and how came he to fail of it
here? A Stoical Apathy had better be|came
him than &s;uch childi&s;h and effemi|nate
Grief, which not only makes him a
mean and poor-&s;pirited Mortal; but is a
gro&s;s <HI>Ab&s;urdity</HI> and <HI>Incredibility</HI> upon Con|&s;ideration
of his Will and Power to fetch
<PB N="40" REF="47">
<HI>Lazarus</HI> to Life again. If there be not,
according to the Fathers, My&s;tery in the&s;e
Tears of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> they are a fooli&s;h and un|natural
Prelude to a Farce, he was acting
in the pretended Re&s;u&s;citation of <HI>Lazarus.</HI></P>
<P>Some antient Catholicks, not being ap|pri&s;ed
of the My&s;tery; were &s;o offended
at the&s;e Words, <HI>Je&s;us wept,</HI> that, as <HI>Epi|phanius</HI>
 <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lacrymatus e&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> quod aliquando era&s;um fu|i&s;&s;e a Catholicis quibu&s;dam &s;cribit Epiphanius. Vid. <HI>Dru&s;ium in Loc. Johan.</HI></NOTE> &s;ays, they expung'd them out
of their Bibles; and I wonder, they have
not, before now, di&s;turb'd the Faith of
Mini&s;ters of the Letter, to the utter Re|jection
of the Miracle.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Ob&s;erve that <HI>John</HI> &s;ays, it was
with <HI>a loud Voice,</HI> that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> call'd <HI>Laza|rus</HI>
forth out of his Cave. And why, I
pray, a louder Voice than ordinary? Was
dead <HI>Lazarus</HI> deafer than <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daugh|ter,
or the Widow's Son? Or was his
Soul at &s;o great a Di&s;tance from his Body,
as he could not hear a &s;till and low Voice?
Some &s;uch &s;illy Rea&s;on as <HI>this</HI> mu&s;t be gi|ven
for this <HI>loud Voice</HI> here; but how ab|&s;urd
it is according to the Letter, Infidels
will judge, till Chri&s;tians can a&s;&s;ign a bet|ter.
The dead can hear the Whi&s;per of
the Almighty, if Power go along with it,
<PB N="41" REF="48">
as &s;oon as the Sound of a Trumpet. St.
<HI>John</HI> then &s;hould not have written of a
<HI>loud Voice,</HI> unle&s;s he meant to adapt his
Story to the Capacities and Conceptions of
the Vulgar, who have no Apprehen&s;ions
of God's Power, out of &s;en&s;ible and hu|man
Repre&s;entations of it.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Becau&s;e that a Miracle &s;hould
be well guarded again&s;t all Su&s;picion of
Fraud, I was thinking to make it an <HI>Ab|&s;urdity,</HI>
that the Napkin, before <HI>Je&s;us</HI> rais'd
<HI>Lazarus,</HI> was not taken from his Face, that
the Spectators might behold his mortified
Looks, and the miraculous Change of his
Countenance from Death unto Life. What
<HI>Infidels</HI> think of this Circum&s;tance I know
not: I hope it is not with them a Token
of Fraud and Impo&s;ture; tho I mu&s;t needs
&s;ay, that if the Fathers did not let me in|to
the My&s;tery of the Napkin about <HI>Laza|rus</HI>'s
Face when <HI>Je&s;us</HI> call'd him forth, I
&s;hould not my &s;elf like it.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> and la&s;tly, Ob&s;erve, St. <HI>John</HI>
&s;ays, v. 45. that <HI>many of the Jews, who
had &s;een the Things that Je&s;us did</HI> here;
<HI>believed on him</HI>; and <HI>&s;ome of them,</HI> v. 46.
who did not believe, <HI>went their Ways to
the Phari&s;ees and told them what Things
Je&s;us had done</HI> in this pretended Miracle,
<PB N="42" REF="49">
and how the Bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted:
Whereupon the Chief Prie&s;ts and Phari|&s;ees
were &s;o far incens'd as v. 53. <HI>from that
Day forth they took Council together to put
him to Death</HI>; and Ch. xii. 10. <HI>con&s;ulted,
that they might put</HI> Lazarus <HI>al&s;o to Death.</HI>
Je&s;us <HI>therefore</HI> (and his Di&s;ciples and <HI>La|zarus</HI>
fled for it, for they) v. 54. <HI>walk'd
no more openly among the Jews,</HI> but <HI>went
thence into a Country near to the Wilderne&s;s</HI>
(a convenient hiding Place) <HI>and there con|tinued
with his Di&s;ciples</HI>; otherwi&s;e in all
Probability they had been all &s;acrificed.</P>
<P>I dare not argue upon the&s;e Circum|&s;tances,
neither would I, for the Honour
of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> have mention'd them; but that
my old Friend, the Jewi&s;h <HI>Rabbi,</HI> who
help'd me to the Satirical Invective again&s;t
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Miracle of <HI>turning Water into Wine,</HI>
has hence form'd an Objection again&s;t <HI>La|zarus</HI>'s
Re&s;urrection, and &s;ent me a <HI>Letter</HI>
upon it, de&s;iring me to publi&s;h it, and ex|hort
the <HI>Clergy</HI> to an&s;wer it; otherwi&s;e he
would clande&s;tinely hand it about to the
Prejudice of our Religion: Whereupon I,
rather than Chri&s;tianity &s;hould &s;o &s;uffer, do
here publi&s;h it, and it is as follows.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>Sr.</HI> When we la&s;t di&s;cours'd on <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
Miracles, I promi&s;ed to &s;end you my
Thoughts on <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Re&s;urrection,
which I look upon as a notorious Im|po&s;ture,
<PB N="43" REF="50">
and for the Proof of it, need go no
farther, than to the Circum&s;tances of its
Story, which your <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> has related.</P>
<P>If there had been an indi&s;putable Mi|racle
wrought in <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Re&s;urrecti|on;
why were the <HI>Chief-Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Pha|ri&s;ees</HI>
&s;o incens'd upon it, as <HI>to take
Council to put both Je&s;us</HI> and <HI>Lazarus</HI> to
<HI>Death for it?</HI> Where was the Provoca|tion?
I can conceive none. Tho' the
<HI>Jews</HI> were ever &s;o canker'd with Ma|lice
and Hatred to <HI>Je&s;us</HI> before; yet
&s;uch a mo&s;t &s;tupendous Miracle was e|nough
to &s;top their Mouths, and turn
their Hearts: Or if their Prejudices a|gain&s;t
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> were in&s;uperable, and they
hated him but the more for the Num|ber
and Greatne&s;s of his Miracles; yet
why is poor <HI>Lazarus,</HI> inoffen&s;ive <HI>Laza|rus,</HI>
upon whom this good and great
Work was wrought, an Object of their
Hatred too? Your <HI>Divines</HI> are to give a
credible and probable Account of this
Matter, &s;uch a one as will comport with
Rea&s;on and Sen&s;e; or we &s;hall conclude,
that it was <HI>Fraud,</HI> detected in this pre|tended
Miracle, which ju&s;tly provok'd
the Indignation of our Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, what is all you can &s;ay, that
it was downright inhumanity, Barbarity
and Brutality in the <HI>Jews</HI> to hate <HI>La|zarus</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="51">
as well as <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> will not do here.
Tho' this may pa&s;s with many Chri&s;tians,
who are ready to &s;wallow, without
chewing, any evil Reports of our Na|tion;
yet it can't go down with rea|&s;onable
and unprejudic'd Men, who
mu&s;t have other Conceptions of human
Nature in all Ages and Nations, than
to think it po&s;&s;ible, that a Man, in <HI>La|zarus</HI>'s
Ca&s;e, can be hated and per&s;ecu|ted
for having had &s;uch a good and won|derful
Work done on him. And why
then was he hated and per&s;ecuted? I
&s;ay, for this, and no other Rea&s;on, than
becau&s;e he was a Confederate with <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
in the wicked Impo&s;ture, he was putting
upon Mankind.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing, what is never to be
granted, that the <HI>Jews</HI> of old were &s;o
inhuman, bruti&s;h, and barbarous as to
hate and per&s;ecute <HI>Lazarus</HI> as well as
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> for this Miracle; yet why did
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> and his Di&s;ciples, with <HI>Lazarus,</HI>
run away and ab&s;cond upon it? for they
v. 54. <HI>walk'd no more openly among the</HI>
Jews, <HI>but went thence into a Country near
to the Wilderne&s;s, and there</HI> Je&s;us <HI>continued
with his Di&s;ciples.</HI> Is not here a plain
Sign of Guilt and of Fraud? Men, that
have God's Cau&s;e, Truth and Power on
their Side, never want Courage and Re|&s;olution
<PB N="45" REF="52">
to &s;tand to it. And however
your Chri&s;tian <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> may palliate the
cowardly and timerous Conduct of <HI>Je|&s;us</HI>
and his Confederates in this Ca&s;e;
yet with me, it's like Demon&s;tration,
that there was a di&s;cover'd Cheat in the
Miracle, or they would undauntedly
have faced their Enemies, without Fears
And Apprehen&s;ions of Danger from them.</P>
<P>Our Ance&s;tors then, who unque&s;|tionably
detected the Fraud, were in the
right on't to pro&s;ecute with Severity,
the whole Party concern'd in it: And if
they had aveng'd the Wickedne&s;s of it
upon <HI>Lazarus</HI> as well as they did upon
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> I &s;hould have commended them
for it. Whether &s;uch a mon&s;trous Im|po&s;ture,
as was this pretended Miracle,
happily di&s;cover'd does not call aloud for
Vengeance and mo&s;t exemplary Puni&s;h|ment;
and whether any Nation of the
World would &s;uffer the like with Im|punity,
let any Man judge.</P>
<P>For all the Reports of your Go&s;pels,
it is unnatural to hate a miraculous
Healer of Di&s;ea&s;es; and there mu&s;t be
&s;omewhat &s;uppre&s;t about the Inveteracy
of the <HI>Jews</HI> to <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> or his healing
Power, if it was &s;o great as is imagined,
mu&s;t have reconciled them to him: But
that they &s;hould hate not only <HI>Je&s;us</HI> for
<PB N="46" REF="53">
rai&s;ing the dead, but the Per&s;on rais'd
by him, is improbable, incredible, and
impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>If Hi&s;torians can parrallel this Story of
the Malignity of the <HI>Jews</HI> towards
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> and <HI>Lazarus</HI> upon &s;uch a real Mi|racle,
with any Thing equally barbarous
and inhuman, in any other Sect or Na|tion;
we will acknowledge the Truth
of it again&s;t our ancient Nation: Or if
&s;uch Inhumanity, ab&s;tractedly con&s;ider'd,
be at all agreeable to the Conceptions any
one can form of Human Nature in the
mo&s;t uncivilis'd and bruti&s;h People, we
will allow our Ance&s;tors, in this Ca&s;e,
to have been that People.</P>
<P>Was &s;uch a real and indi&s;putable Mi|racle,
as this of <HI>Lazarus</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed, to be
wrought at this day in Confirmation of
Chri&s;tianity, I dare &s;ay, it would bring
all us <HI>Jews,</HI> to a Man, into the Belief
of it: And I don't think it po&s;&s;ible, for
any People to be &s;o begotten, bya&s;s'd,
and prejudiced, as not to be wrought
on by it. Or if they would not part
with their Intere&s;ts and Prejudices upon
it, they would have more Wit and
Temper, than to break forth into a
Rage again&s;t all or any of the Per&s;ons
concern'd in it. And, for my Life, I
can entertain no wor&s;e Thoughts of our
old Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="54">
Suppo&s;ing God &s;hould &s;end an Am|ba&s;&s;ador
at this day, who, to convince
Chri&s;tians of the Mi&s;chiefs and Incon|venience
of an <HI>Hireling Prie&s;thood,</HI>
&s;hould work &s;uch a Miracle as was this
of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Re&s;urrection, in the Pre|&s;ence
of a multitude of Spectators; how
would your <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI> behave
them&s;elves upon it? Why, they would
be as mute as Fi&s;hes; or if they did
fret and grieve inwardly for the Lo&s;s
of their Intere&s;ts; yet they would have
more Prudence (ask them el&s;e,) than to
&s;how their Anger openly, and per&s;ecute
both <HI>Agent</HI> and <HI>Patient</HI> for it. Where|fore
then are they &s;o cen&s;orious and un|charitable
as to preach and believe ano|ther
Notion and Doctrine of our An|ce&s;tors?</P>
<P>But if a fal&s;e Prophet, for the &s;ubver|&s;ion
of an <HI>Hireling Prie&s;thood,</HI> &s;hould,
in &s;pite to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> counterfeit &s;uch a
Miracle, and be detected in the Opera|tion;
how then would Prie&s;ts and Peo|ple,
Magi&s;trates and Subjects behave up|on
it? Why, they would be full of In|dignation,
and <HI>from that day forth would
take Council to put</HI> the Impo&s;tor and his
Confederate to Death, of which they
would be mo&s;t de&s;erving; and if they
did not ab&s;cond and fly for it, like <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="55">
and his Di&s;ciples <HI>to a Wilderne&s;s in the
Country</HI> to hide them&s;elves, the Rage of
the Populace would hardly wait the
Lei&s;ure of Ju&s;tice to di&s;patch and make
terrible Examples of them. Was not
this exactly the Ca&s;e of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Impo|&s;ture
in the Re&s;urrection of <HI>Lazarus,</HI>
and of the Puni&s;hment he was threaten'd
with, and afterwards mo&s;t ju&s;tly under|went
for it?</P>
<P>Mankind may be in &s;ome Ca&s;es very
obdurate, and &s;o hard of Belief, as to &s;tand
it out again&s;t Sen&s;e, Rea&s;on and De|mon&s;tration:
But I will not think wor&s;e
of our Ance&s;tors than of the re&s;t of
Mankind; or that they any more than
others would have with&s;tood a clear and
indi&s;putable Miracle in <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Re&s;u|&s;citation.
Such a manife&s;t Miracle, let
it be wrought for what End and Pur|po&s;e,
we can po&s;&s;ibly imagine, would
&s;trike Men with Awe and Reverence;
and none could hate and per&s;ecute the
Author of the Miracle; lea&s;t He who
could rai&s;e the dead, &s;hould exert his
Power again&s;t them&s;elves, and either
wound or &s;inite them dead with it.
For which Rea&s;on, the Re&s;urrection of
<HI>Lazarus,</HI> on the certain Knowledge of
our Ance&s;tors, was all Fraud, or they
would have reverenc'd and adored the
Power of him, that did it.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="56">
It may be true, what <HI>John</HI> &s;ays, that
<HI>many of the Jews, who had &s;een the
Things that Je&s;us did, believed on him,</HI>
that is, believed that he had wrought
here a great Miraale: But who were
the&s;e? the ignorant and credulous, whom
a much le&s;s <HI>juggler</HI> than Mr. <HI>Fawkes</HI>
could ea&s;ily impos'd on. But on the o|ther
hand, it is certain, according to <HI>Chri&s;|tian
Commentators,</HI> that <HI>&s;ome of them</HI> did
not believe the Miracle, but <HI>went their
ways to the Phari&s;ees and told them what
Things Je&s;us had done,</HI> that is, told
them, after what manner the Intrigue
was managed; and complain'd of the
Fraud in it. How they came to &s;u&s;pect
and di&s;cover the Fraud, was not <HI>John</HI>'
Bu&s;ine&s;s to relate; and for want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
other ancient Memorials, we can only
gue&s;s at it. Perhaps they di&s;cern'd &s;ome
motion in <HI>Lazarus</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s Body, before the
Word of Command, to <HI>come forth,</HI> was
given; perhaps they di&s;cover'd &s;ome
Fragments of the Food, that for <HI>four
days</HI> in the Cave, he had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on:
But however this was, they could not
but take Notice of the <HI>Napkin about his
Face</HI> all the while; which <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to pre|vent
all &s;u&s;picion of Cheat, &s;hould have
fir&s;t order'd to be taken off, that his
mortify'd Countenance might be view'd,
<PB N="50" REF="57">
before the miraculous Change of it to
Life was wrought. This neglect in
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> (which I wonder <HI>John</HI> had no
more Wit than to hint at) will be a la&s;t|ing
Objection to the Miracle. <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
was wi&s;er, than not to be aware of the
Objection, which he would have obvi|ated,
if he dur&s;t, by a Removal of the
Napkin, to the &s;atisfaction of all Spec|tators
there pre&s;ent. Becau&s;e this was
not done, we <HI>Jews</HI> now deny, there
was any Miracle wrought; and, whe|ther
our Unbelief upon this Circum|&s;tance
be not well grounded, we appeal
to Chri&s;tian Prie&s;ts them&s;elves, who
mu&s;t own, that if there was a Miracle
here, the Matter was ill conducted by
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> or fooli&s;hly related by his <HI>Evan|geli&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It is a &s;ad Misfortune, that attends our
modern enquiry after Truth, that there
are no other Memorials extant of the
Life and Miracles of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> than what
are written by his own Di&s;ciples. Not
only old Time has devour'd, but Chri|&s;tians
them&s;elves, (which in the Opini|on
of the impartial makes for us) when
they got Power into their Hands, wil|fully
de&s;troy'd many Writings of our An|ce&s;tors,
as well as of <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> and <HI>Porphi|ry</HI>
and others, which they could not an|&s;wer;
<PB N="51" REF="58">
otherwi&s;e I doubt not but they
would have given us clear Light into
the Impo&s;ture of <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Re&s;urrecti|on:
But if <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> according to his own
<HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> was arraign'd for a <HI>Decei|ver</HI>
and <HI>Bla&s;phemer,</HI> in pretending to the
Son&s;hip and Power of God by his Mi|racles;
in all Probability this Piece of
Fraud in <HI>Lazarus</HI> was one Article of the
Indictment again&s;t him; and what makes
it very likely, is that the <HI>Chief Prie&s;ts</HI>
and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> from the Date of this pre|tended
Miracle, <HI>took Council together to
put him to Death,</HI> not clande&s;tinely or
tumultuou&s;ly to murder him, but judici|ally
to puni&s;h him with Death, which,
if they proved their Indictment by cre|dible
and &s;ufficient Witne&s;&s;es, he was
mo&s;t worthy of.</P>
<P>As it is plain from the Story in <HI>John,</HI>
that there was a Di&s;pute among the By|&s;tanders
at <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Re&s;urrection, whe|ther
it was a real Miracle or not; &s;o it
is the Opinion of us <HI>Jews,</HI> which is of
the Nature of a Tradition, that the
<HI>Chief-Prie&s;ts</HI> and civil Magi&s;trates of <HI>Be|thany,</HI>
for the better Determination of
the Di&s;pute and quieting of the Minds of
the People, requir'd that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;hould
re-act the Miracle upon another Per&s;on,
there lately dead and buried. But <HI>Je|&s;us</HI>

declining this Te&s;t of his Power, the
whole Multitude of Believers as well as

<HI>one</HI> Rea&s;on among others of that vehe|ment

at <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Tryal, for his Crucifixion. I'll
not an&s;wer for the Certainty of this

Truth and Credibility; and for the
Proof of it, I need only appeal to Chri&s;|tain
<HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI>; whether,
under a Di&s;pute of a Miracle of that
Con&s;equence, they would not require,

whether there would not be a general

<HI>Execution.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Matthev, Mark</HI> and <HI>Luke,</HI> who knew
as much of this Sham Miracle as <HI>John,</HI>
had not the Confidence to report it;
becau&s;e, when they wrote, many Eye-Witne&s;&s;es
of the Fraud were alive to
di&s;prove and contradict them; therefore
they confined their Narratives to <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
le&s;s juggling Tricks, that had pa&s;s'd more
current: But after the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> State
<PB N="53" REF="62">
was di&s;&s;olved, their judicial Records were
de&s;troy'd, and every Body dead that
could confute him, <HI>John</HI> ventures a|broad
the Story of this Miracle; and if
the good Providence of God had not
infatuated him, in the In&s;ertion of the
Circum&s;tances here ob&s;erved, it might
have pa&s;s'd through all Generations to
come, as well as it has done for many
pa&s;t, for a grand Miracle.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Sir,</HI> have you a few of my
Thoughts on the pretended Miracle of
<HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Re&s;urrection. I have more to
be&s;tow on it, but that I would not be
tedious. There's no need to argue a|gain&s;t
the other two Re&s;urrection-Stories.
You know <HI>omne majus includit minus,</HI>
and if the greate&s;t of the three Miracles
be an Impo&s;ture, the two le&s;s ones of
Con&s;equence are Artifice and Fraud.
And rather than the Miracle of <HI>Lazarus</HI>
&s;hall &s;tand its Ground, I'll have t'other
Bout at it from &s;ome other Circum|&s;tances;
the Con&s;ideration of which will
make it as fooli&s;h and wicked an Impo|&s;ture,
as ever was contrived and tran|&s;acted
in the World; &s;uch a <HI>wicked Im|po&s;ture</HI>
of mo&s;t pernicious Con&s;equence to

Your <HI>Divines</HI> think they have exhau&s;ted

I beg of them, for the Love of
<HI>Je&s;us,</HI> not to let their Di&s;plea&s;ure be vi&s;i|bly

the Objections, I think it impo&s;&s;ible &s;atis|factorily

Recour&s;e to the Opinions of the Fathers,
that the&s;e three Miracles, whether they

<P>There are two Ways, that the Fathers

have conceiv'd Sin in their Hearts, and
have not brought it forth into Act; are
figured by <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter, who lay
dead in the Hou&s;e of her Father, and was
not taken forth to her Burial. Others,
who after Cogitation and Con&s;ent, pa&s;s into
actual Sin are figured by the Young Man,
carried towards his Grave. But tho&s;e
Sinners, who are habituated and long ac|cu&s;tom'd
to Sin, are like <HI>Lazarus</HI> bury'd,
and in a &s;tinking Condition under the Cor|ruption
<PB N="60" REF="69">

with the <HI>loud Voice</HI> of the Praedication of
his Go&s;pel, will call forth out of the
Death and Grave of their Sins to a new
Life. So does St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> make the&s;e
three dead Per&s;ons and their Re&s;urrections,
Emblems of the &s;aid three Sorts of Sin|ners,
who are dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins,

the rai&s;ing of <HI>Jairus</HI>'s Daughter is
a Type of the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Jews</HI> at
that Day, as <HI>Eu&s;ebius Gallicanus</HI> <NOTE N="35" PLACE="foot">Quod enim tunc temporis factum e&s;t in una Puella, hoc in fine Temporum futurum e&s;t, ut fiat in tota. Sonagoga. <HI>In Homil. Feriae</HI> 5<HI>ta post Domin.</HI> 4<HI>tam.</HI></NOTE> and

Way of Type and Figure.</P>
<P>Among all the Miracles that <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
wrought, and are recorded by the <HI>Evan|geli&s;ts,</HI>
I think, as far as I have had Occa|&s;ion
to ob&s;erve, the Fathers are mo&s;t &s;can|ty
in their Interpretations of that of the
<PB N="64" REF="73">
Widow of <HI>Naim</HI>'s Son: Excepting what
is before noted of his being a figure of a
Sinner dead in actual, tho not habitual
Sin, I find very little. But if <HI>Origen</HI>'s
Comments on this Miracle had been ex|tant,
I dare &s;ay he would have given us
this following Interpretation of it. This
Widow, he would have call'd the Church;
and her <HI>only Son</HI> or ma&s;culine Offspring, he
would have call'd the <HI>Spiritual Sen&s;e</HI> of
the Scriptures, which is now dead, and
that the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the <HI>Letter,</HI> who are
his Bearers, are for interring him within
the <HI>Earth</HI> of the <HI>Letter:</HI> But <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> upon
his Spiritual Advent will put a &s;top to the
Intention of &s;uch Bearers, by reviving the
<HI>Spiritual Sen&s;e</HI> of the Scriptures; and by
re&s;toring it, like a <HI>quicken'd Son,</HI> to the
Comfort of his Mother, the Church; who
has been in a &s;orrowful and lamentable
Condition upon the Death and Want of
it. This, I am &s;ure, would be <HI>Origen</HI>'s
Interpretation of this Miracle, which, if I
had Room here, by a little Circumlocu|tion,
I could prove.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Lazarus</HI>'s Re&s;urrection, it is in the
Opinion of the Fathers <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">Per Lazarum Genus humanum o&s;tenditur. <HI>Theop. Antioch. in Loc. Johan.</HI> No&s;tra Re&s;urrectio figuratur per Lazari Re&s;urrectionem.&mdash;Spelunca &s;ive Sepulchrum Lazari Litteram Legis umbratilem de|&s;ignat.&mdash;<HI>Magna Voce clamavit Je&s;us,</HI> id <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, Prae|dicatio Evangelii per quam humana Natura Peccatorum Vinculis &amp; in Scpulchro Infidelitatis jacens vocatur ad Vitam. <HI>Theop.

in the Perfection of Time. But this
is a mo&s;t copious Subject; and unle&s;s I
could here throughly handle it, I had much
better &s;ay nothing.</P>
<P>And thus have I done with the three
Re&s;urrection Stories. If the <HI>Convocation,</HI>
next Se&s;&s;ion, would determine by an Or|thodox
Vote, whether <HI>Je&s;us</HI> rais'd any
more, than the &s;aid three Per&s;ons, from
the dead or not; I would pre&s;ent them
with a new and more entertaining Chain
of Thoughts again&s;t the&s;e Miracles; &s;uch
a Chain of Thoughts, as, upon the Con|clu&s;ion,
let them hold which Side of the
Que&s;tion they plea&s;e, will nece&s;&s;arily in|duce
us to hold the my&s;tical Meaning of
the&s;e Miracles, or to grant that <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
rais'd none from the dead at all.</P>
<P>My next and la&s;t <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> on <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
Miracles &s;hall be again&s;t the Letter of the
Story of his own Re&s;urrection, in which,

<PB N="66" REF="75"><HI>Lectures,</HI> as &s;hall hold them tug, &s;o
long as the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> of the <HI>Letter</HI> and an

why &s;hould the People be any longer

<P>If I had not had Experience of it, I

or malicious as to pro&s;ecute me for an <HI>In|fidel</HI>

Man may be mi&s;taken in him&s;elf! I took
my &s;elf for a real Advocate for the Truth
of Chri&s;tianity; and was &s;o vain as to ima|gine
the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es tended to a Demon|&s;tration
of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip: And tho
the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>London</HI> may be of a contrary
Opinion, yet I am &s;till &s;o conceited of
my Ability to defend our Religion, that
I'll &s;take my Life again&s;t his <HI>Bi&s;hoprick,</HI>
which I'll not be troubled with, if I win it,
that he can't form an Objection again&s;t
Chri&s;tianity, which I can't &s;olidly confute,
and make our Readers merry too, with his
Weakne&s;s and Impertinence in it. But
perhaps it may be unbecoming of his
Lord&s;hip's Character, and again&s;t the
<PB N="67" REF="76">
Grain, to make an Objection to that Re|ligion,
which he finds much <HI>temporal,</HI> as

Propo&s;al, <HI>viz.</HI> If he'll but publi&s;h
an An&s;wer to the <HI>Jewi&s;h Rabbi</HI>'s Letter in

of a Reply to him; then (to &s;ave the
Civil Magi&s;trate's Trouble) I will &s;uffer
any Puni&s;hment that in his Clemency he
&s;hall think fit to inflict on me, for what's
pa&s;t. Oh, what a Hazard do I here run of
Life or Liberty!</P>
<P>Some Chri&s;tians, in my Ca&s;e, would
think it a &s;ad Misfortune to be odiou&s;ly

to the Danger they think my Soul is

<ITEM><HI>Imprimis,</HI> I believe upon the Authority

<ITEM><HI>Item,</HI> I believe upon the Authority of

Antichri&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Item,</HI> I believe upon the Authority of

of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="69" REF="78">
<HI>Item,</HI> I believe upon the Authority of
the Fathers, that the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> of the <HI>Let|ter,</HI>
and an Hireling-Prie&s;thood have been
the Cau&s;e of the Infidelity and Apo&s;tacy of
the&s;e latter Times.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Item,</HI> I believe upon the Authority of
the Fathers, that the Spirit and Power of
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> will &s;oon enter the Church and
expel Hireling-Prie&s;ts, who make Mer|chandi&s;e
of the Go&s;pel, out of her, af|ter
the manner he is &s;uppos'd to have dri|ven
the <HI>Buyers</HI> and <HI>Sellers</HI> out of the Tem|ple.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The&s;e are a few Articles of that Faith,
once deliver'd to the <HI>Saints</HI> of the primi|tive
Church, which I firmly believe, and
will earne&s;tly contend for. Now I ap|peal
to the Chri&s;tian World, whether a
Man of &s;uch a Faith, like Heart of Oak,
can be an Infidel or Bla&s;phemer. Upon
this ingenuous Confe&s;&s;ion of my Faith,
which I make by way of Atonement for
my pa&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed Errors and Offences, I
hope the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and all good Chri&s;tian
People will be reconciled to me.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Jame's</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Faith without
Works is dead,</HI> and how a Man ought to
how his Faith by his Works, without
<PB N="70" REF="79">
which Faith is an empty and airy Nothing.
Accordingly I am making what ha&s;te I can
to &s;how the Sincerity of my Faith by
the&s;e my <HI>Works</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> of this Kind.
And by the Grace of God, I hope our
Bi&s;hops will find me as unmoveable as a
Rock in the &s;aid Faith.</P>
<P>According to the fore&s;aid Articles of
this my Faith, I am &s;o fully convinced, not
only of the Error of the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> of the
<HI>Letter,</HI> but of the Mi&s;chiefs and Incon|veniences
of an <HI>Hireling-Prie&s;thood,</HI> that,
having &s;et my Shoulders to the Work, I
am re&s;olv'd, by the Help of God, to en|deavour
to give <HI>both</HI> a Lift out of this
World. This is fair and generous Warn|ing
to our <HI>Clergy</HI> to &s;it fa&s;t, and look to
their own Safety, or they may find me a
&s;tronger Man than they may be aware of.
And tho I don't expect long to &s;urvive
the Accompli&s;hment of &s;o great and
glorious a Work; yet I am delightfully
ravi&s;h'd and tran&s;ported with the Fore|thought
and Contemplation of the Happi|ne&s;s
of Mankind, upon the Extinction of
Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Vermin,</HI> out of God's Hou&s;e;
when the World will return to its <HI>Primo|genial</HI>
and <HI>Paradi&s;aical</HI> State of Nature,
Religion and Liberty; in which we &s;hall be
<HI>all taught of God,</HI> and <HI>have no need</HI> of
fooli&s;h and contentious Prie&s;t, hired to ha|rangue

us with his Noi&s;e and Non&s;en&s;e.
Which ble&s;&s;ed State of the World God of
his infinite Mercy ha&s;ten, for the &s;ake of

for ever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
