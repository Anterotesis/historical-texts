<HEAD>SINS OF GOVERNMENT, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are called upon by high authority to &s;eparate, for religious purpo&s;es, this portion of our common time. The &s;hops are &s;hut; the arti&s;an is &s;ummoned from his loom; and the hu&s;bandman from his plough; the whole nation, in the mid&s;t of its bu&s;ine&s;s, its plea&s;ures, and its pur&s;uits, makes a &s;udden &s;top, and wears the &s;emblance, at lea&s;t, of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and concern. It is natural for you to enquire, What is the purport of all this?&mdash;the an&s;wer is in the words of my text: "<HI>Ye &s;tand this day, all</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<HI>of you, before the face of the Lord.&mdash;</HI>Deute|ronomy, xxix. 10. You &s;tand all of you, that is, you &s;tand here as a nation, and you &s;tand for the declared purpo&s;e of con|fe&s;&s;ing your &s;ins, and humbling your&s;elves before the Supreme Being.</P>
<P>Every individual, my brethren, who has a &s;en&s;e of religion, and a de&s;ire of conform|ing his conduct to its precepts, will fre|quently retire into him&s;elf to di&s;cover his faults; and having di&s;covered to repent of, and having repented of, to amend them. Nations have likewi&s;e <HI>their</HI> faults to repent of, <HI>their</HI> conduct to examine; and it is there|fore no le&s;s becoming and &s;alutary, that <HI>they,</HI> from time to time, &s;hould engage in the &s;ame duty. Tho&s;e &s;ins which we have to repent of as individuals, belong to &s;uch tran&s;actions as relate to our private concerns, and are executed by us in our private capa|city, &s;uch as buying, &s;elling, the manage|ment of our family oeconomy, differences ari&s;ing from jarring intere&s;ts and interfering claims between us and our neighbours, &amp;c.
<PB N="3" REF="4">
Tho&s;e &s;ins which, as a nation, we have to repent of, belong to national acts.</P>
<P>We act as a nation, when, through the organ of the legi&s;lative power, which &s;peaks the will of the nation, and by means of the executive power which does the will of the nation, we enact laws, form alliances, make war or peace, di&s;po&s;e of the public money, or do any of tho&s;e things which belong to us in our collective capacity. As, compa|ratively, few individuals have any immediate &s;hare in the&s;e public acts, we might be tempted to forget the re&s;pon&s;ibility which attaches to the nation at large with regard to them, did not the wi&s;dom and piety of the governing powers, by thus calling us to|gether on every public emergency, remind us that they are all <HI>our own</HI> acts; and that, for every violation of integrity, ju&s;tice, or humanity in public affairs, it is incumbent upon every one of us, to humble him&s;elf per&s;onally before the tribunal of Almighty God.</P>
<P>That this is the true and only rational in|terpretation of the &s;olemnities of this day,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
is evident from hence, that we are never en|joined to confe&s;s the &s;ins of other people; but our own &s;ins. To take upon our&s;elves the faults of others, &s;avours of pre&s;umption, rather than humility. There would be an ab&s;urd mockery in pretending to humble our&s;elves before God for mi&s;deeds which we have neither committed, nor have any power to amend. Tho&s;e evils which we could not help, and in which we have had no &s;hare, are &s;ubjects of grief indeed, but not of re|mor&s;e. If an oppre&s;&s;ive law, or a de&s;tructive war, were of the nature of a volcano or a hurricane, proceeding from cau&s;es totally independent of our operations, all we &s;hould have to do, would be to bow our heads in &s;ilent &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and to bear their ravages with a manly patience. We do not <HI>repent</HI> of a dangerous, di&s;order or a &s;ickly con&s;titu|tion, becau&s;e the&s;e are things which do not depend upon our own efforts. If, therefore, the nation at large had nothing to do in the affairs of the nation, the piety of our rulers would have led them to fa&s;t and pray by them&s;elves alone, without inviting <HI>us</HI> to
<PB N="5" REF="6">
concur in this &s;alutary work. But we are called upon to repent of national &s;ins, becau&s;e we <HI>can</HI> help them, and becau&s;e we ought to help them. We are not fondly to imagine we can make of kings, or of lawgivers, the &s;cape-goats to an&s;wer for our follies and our crimes: by the &s;ervices of this day they call upon us to an&s;wer for them; they throw the blame where it ought ultimately to re&s;t; that is, where the power ultimately re&s;ts. It were trifling with our con&s;ciences to en|deavour to &s;eparate the acts of governors &s;anctioned by the nation, from the acts of the nation; for, in every tran&s;action the principal is an&s;werable for the conduct of the agents he employs to tran&s;act it. If the maxim that the king can do no wrong throws upon mini&s;ters the re&s;pon&s;ibility, becau&s;e without mini&s;ters no wrong could be done, the &s;ame rea&s;on throws it from them upon the people, without whom mi|ni&s;ters could do no wrong.</P>
<P>The language of the Proclamation then may be thus interpreted&mdash;People! who in your individual capacities are rich and poor, high
<PB N="6" REF="7">
and low, governors and governed, a&s;&s;emble your&s;elves in the unity of your public exi&s;|tence; re&s;t from your ordinary occupations, give a different direction to the exerci&s;es of your public wor&s;hip, confe&s;s&mdash;not every man his own &s;ins, but all the &s;ins of all. We, your appointed rulers, before we allow our|&s;elves to go on in executing <HI>your will</HI> in a conjuncture &s;o important, force you to make a pau&s;e, that you may be con&s;trained to reflect, that you may bring this will, paramount every el&s;e, into the &s;acred pre|&s;ence of God; that you may there examine it, and &s;ee whether it be agreeable to his will, and to the eternal obligations of virtue and good morals. If not, the guilt be upon your own heads; we di&s;claim the awful re&s;pon&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing that you are now prepared by proper views of the &s;ubject, I &s;hall go on to inve&s;tigate tho&s;e &s;ins which a nation is mo&s;t apt to be betrayed into, leaving it to each of you to determine whether, and how far, any one of them ought to make a part of <HI>our</HI> humiliation on this day.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">
Societies being compo&s;ed of individuals, the faults of &s;ocieties proceed from the &s;ame bad pa&s;&s;ions, the &s;ame pride, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and thir&s;t of gain, by which individuals are led to tran&s;gre&s;s the rules of duty; they require therefore the &s;ame curb to re&s;train them, and hence the nece&s;&s;ity of a national reli|gion. You will probably a&s;&s;ert, that mo&s;t nations have one; but, by a national reli|gion, I do not mean the burning a few wretches twice or thrice in a year in honour of God, nor yet the exacting &s;ub&s;cription to &s;ome ob&s;cure tenets, believed by few, and under&s;tood by none; nor yet the inve&s;ting a certain order of men dre&s;&s;ed in a particular habit, with civil privileges and &s;ecular emo|lument; by national religion I under&s;tand, the extending to tho&s;e affairs in which we act in common and as a body, that regard to religion, by which, when we act &s;ingly, we all profe&s;s to be guided. Nothing &s;eems more obvious; and yet there are men who appear not in&s;en&s;ible to the rules of mora|lity as they re&s;pect individuals, and who
<PB N="8" REF="9">
unaccountably di&s;claim them with re&s;pect to nations. They will not cheat their oppo&s;ite neighbour, but they will take a pride in over-reaching a neighbouring &s;tate; they would &s;corn to foment di&s;&s;entions in the fa|mily of an acquaintance, but they will do &s;o by a community without &s;cruple; they would not join with a gang of hou&s;e-breakers to plunder a private dwelling, but they have no principle which prevents them from joining with a confederacy of princes to plunder a province. As private indivi|dulas, they think it right to pa&s;s by little injuries, but as a people they think they cannot carry too high a principle of proud defiance and &s;anguinary revenge. This &s;uf|ficiently &s;hews, that whatever rule they may acknowledge for their private conduct, they have nothing that can be properly called <HI>na|tional religion</HI>; and indeed, it is very much to be &s;u&s;pected, that their religion in the former ca&s;e, is very much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the contemplation of tho&s;e pains and penalties which &s;ociety has provided again&s;t the crimes of individuals. But the united will
<PB N="9" REF="10">
of a whole people cannot make wrong right, or &s;anction one act of rapacity, inju&s;tice, or breach of faith. The fir&s;t principle, there|fore, we mu&s;t lay down, is, that we are to &s;ubmit our public conduct to the &s;ame rules by which we are to regulate our private ac|tions: A nation that does this, is, as a na|tion, religious; a nation that does it not, though it &s;hould fa&s;t, and pray, and wear &s;ackcloth, and pay tithes, and build churches, is, as a nation, profligate and unprincipled.</P>
<P>The vices of nations may be divided into tho&s;e which relate to their own internal proceedings, or to their relations with other &s;tates. With regard to the fir&s;t, the cau&s;es for humiliation are various. Many nations are guilty of the crime of permitting oppre&s;|&s;ive laws and bad governments to remain among&s;t them, by which the poor are cru&s;hed, and the lives of the innocent are laid at the mercy of wicked and arbitrary men. This is a national &s;in of the deepe&s;t dye, as it involves in it mo&s;t others. It is painful to reflect how many atrocious go|vernments there are in the world; and how
<PB N="10" REF="11">
little even they who enjoy good ones, &s;eem to under&s;tand their true nature. We are apt to &s;peak of the <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of living under a mild government, as if it were like the happine&s;s of living under an indulgent cli|mate; and when we thank God for it, we rank it with the ble&s;&s;ings of the air and of the &s;oil; whereas we ought to thank God for the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI> of living under a good government; for a good government is the fir&s;t of national duties. It is indeed a happine&s;s, and one which demands our mo&s;t grateful thanks, to be born under one which &s;pares us the trouble and hazard of changing it; but a people born under a good government, will probably not die under one, if they conceive of it as of an indolent and pa&s;&s;ive happine&s;s, to be left for its pre&s;ervation, to fortunate conjunc|tures, and the floating and variable chances of incalculable events;&mdash;our &s;econd duty is to keep it good.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not be able to fulfil either of the&s;e duties, except we cultivate in our
<PB N="11" REF="12">
hearts the requi&s;ite di&s;po&s;itions. One of the mo&s;t fruitful &s;ources of evil in the tran&s;|action of national affairs, is a &s;pirit of <HI>in&s;ub|ordination.</HI> Without a quiet &s;ubordina|tion to lawful authority, peace, order, and the ends of good government, can never be attained. To fix this &s;ubordination on its proper ba&s;is, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h in our minds this plain principle, that the will of the minority &s;hould ever yield to that of the majority. By this &s;imple axiom, founded on tho&s;e common principles of ju&s;tice which all men under&s;tand, the large&s;t &s;ociety may be held together with equal ea&s;e as the &s;malle&s;t, provided only &s;ome well con|trived and orderly method be e&s;tabli&s;hed for a&s;certaining that will. It is the immediate extinction of all faction, &s;edition, and ty|ranny. It &s;uper&s;edes the nece&s;&s;ity of go|verning by &s;y&s;tems of blinding or terrifying the people. It puts an end equally to the cabinet cabal, and the muffled con&s;piracy, and occa&s;ions every thing to go on &s;moothly, openly, and fairly; whereas, if the minority attempt to impo&s;e their will upon the ma|jority,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
&s;o unnatural a &s;tate of things will not be &s;ubmitted to without con&s;tant &s;trug|gles on the one &s;ide, and con&s;tant jealou&s;ies on the other. There are two de&s;criptions of men who are in danger of forgetting this excellent rule; <HI>public functionaries,</HI> and <HI>reformers.</HI> Public functionaries, being en|tru&s;ted with large powers for managing the affairs of their fellow-citizens, which ma|nagement, from the nature of things, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be in the hands of a few, are very apt to confound the executive power with the governing will; they require, therefore, to be ob&s;erved with a whole&s;ome &s;u&s;picion, and to be frequently reminded of the nature and limits of their office.&mdash;Re|formers, conceiving of them&s;elves, as of a more enlightened cla&s;s than the bulk of mankind, are likewi&s;e apt to forget the de|ference due to them. Stimulated by newly di&s;covered truths, of which they feel the full force, they are not willing to wait for the gradual &s;pread of knowledge, the &s;ub|&s;iding of pa&s;&s;ion, and the undermining of pre|judices. They too contemn a <HI>&s;wini&s;h multi|tude,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="14">
and aim at an ari&s;tocracy of talents. It is indeed their bu&s;ine&s;s to attack the pre|judices, and to rectify, if they can, the &s;y&s;|tems of their countrymen, but, in the mean time, to acquie&s;ce in them. It is their bu|&s;ine&s;s to &s;ow the &s;eed, and let it lie patiently in the bo&s;om of the ground, perhaps for ages&mdash;to prepare, not to bring about revolu|tions. The public is not always in the wrong for not giving into their views, even where they have the appearance of rea&s;on; for their plans are often crude and prema|ture, their ideas too refined for real life, and influenced by their own particular ca&s;t of thinking; they want people to be happy their way; whereas every one mu&s;t be happy his own way. Freedom is a good thing, but if a nation is not di&s;po&s;ed to accept of it, it is not to be pre&s;ented to them on the point of a bayonet. Freedom is a valuable ble&s;&s;ing, but if even a nation that has enjoyed that ble&s;&s;ing, evidently <HI>choo&s;es</HI> to give it up, the voice of the people ought to prevail; men of more liberal minds &s;hould warn them indeed what they are about; but hav|ing
<PB N="14" REF="15">
done that, they &s;hould acquie&s;ce. If the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, in any country, is ab&s;urd and &s;uper&s;titious in the eyes of think|ing men, &s;o long as it is the religion of the generality, it ought to prevail, and the mi|nority &s;hould not even wi&s;h to &s;upplant it. The endeavouring to overthrow any &s;y&s;tem <HI>before</HI> it is given up by the majority, is fac|tion; the endeavouring to keep it <HI>after</HI> it is given up by them, is tyranny; both are equally wrong, and both proceed from the &s;ame cau&s;e, the want of a principle of due &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>If we find rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the general &s;ketch and outline of government, and with that ba&s;is of &s;ubordination on which we have placed it, it becomes us next to examine, whether the filling up of the plan be equally unexceptionable. Our laws, are they mild, equal, and per&s;picuous; free from burden&s;ome forms and unnece&s;&s;ary delays; not a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of expedients growing out of temporary exigences, but a compact whole; not adapted to local preju|dices, but founded on the broad ba&s;is of
<PB N="15" REF="16">
univer&s;al juri&s;prudence?&mdash;Are they acce&s;|&s;ible to rich and poor, &s;paring of human blood, calculated rather to check and &s;et bounds to the inequality of fortunes than to increa&s;e them, rather to prevent and reform crimes than to puni&s;h them?&mdash;If good, are they well admini&s;tered?&mdash;Is the lenity of the laws &s;hewn in the moderation of the penalties, or in the facility of eva&s;ion and the frequency of e&s;cape?&mdash;Do we profit from greater degrees of in&s;truction and longer experience, and from time to time clear away the tra&s;h and refu&s;e of pa&s;t ages? What all are bound to ob&s;erve, are they &s;o framed as that all may under|&s;tand? Is there any provi&s;ion for in&s;truct|ing the people in the various arbitrary ob|ligations that are laid upon them, or are they &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand them by intui|tion, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> they are too intricate to be ex|plained methodically?&mdash;Are puni&s;hments proportioned to crimes, and rewards to &s;er|vices, or have we two &s;ets of officers, the one to do the work, the other to be paid without doing it?&mdash;Have we any locu&s;ts in the land, any who devour the labours of the
<PB N="16" REF="17">
hu&s;bandman without contributing any thing to the good of &s;ociety by their labours of body or of mind?&mdash;Is the name of God, and the awfulne&s;s of religious &s;anctions, profaned among us by frequent, unnece&s;&s;ary, and en|&s;naring oaths, which lie like &s;tumbling blocks in every path of bu&s;ine&s;s and prefer|ment, tending to corrupt the &s;inglene&s;s of truth, and wear away the delicacy of con|&s;cience; entangling even the innocence and inexperience of children?&mdash;Have we calcu|lated the fal&s;e oaths which, in the &s;pace of one &s;un, the accu&s;ing angel has to carry up from our cu&s;tom-hou&s;es, our various courts, our hu&s;tings, our offices of taxation, and&mdash;from our altars?&mdash;Are they &s;uch as a tear, if we do &s;hed tears on a day &s;uch as this, will blot out?&mdash;Have we calculated the mi&s;chief which is done to the ingenuous mind, when the virgin dignity of his &s;oul is fir&s;t violated by a fal&s;ehood?&mdash;Have we calculated the wound which is given to the peace of a good man, the thorns that are &s;trewed upon his pillow, when through hard nece&s;&s;ity, he complies with what his
<PB N="17" REF="18">
&s;oul abhors? Have we calculated the harm done to the morals of a nation, by the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of perjury? We &s;hall do well, being now by the command of our rulers before the Lord, to reflect on the&s;e things; and if we want food for our na|tional penitence, perhaps we may here find it.</P>
<P><HI>Extravagance</HI> is a fault, to which na|tions, as well as private per&s;ons, are very prone, and the con&s;equences to both are exactly &s;imilar. If a private man lives be|yond his income, the con&s;equence will be lo&s;s of independence, di&s;graceful perplexity, and in the end certain ruin. The cata|&s;trophes of &s;tates are &s;lower in ripening, but like cau&s;es mu&s;t in the end produce like effects.&mdash;If you are acquainted with any in|dividual, who, from inattention to his af|fairs, mi&s;placed confidence, fooli&s;h law-&s;uits, anticipation of his rents and profu&s;ion in his family expences, has involved him&s;elf in debts that eat away his income, what would you &s;ay to &s;uch a one? Would you not tell him, Contract your expences; look your&s;elf into your affairs; in&s;i&s;t upon exact accounts
<PB N="18" REF="19">
from your &s;teward and bailiffs; keep no &s;ervants for mere &s;how and parade; mind only your own affairs, and keep at peace with your neighbours; &s;et religiou&s;ly apart an annual &s;um for di&s;charging the mortgages on your e&s;tate.&mdash;If this be good advice for one man, it is good advice for nine millions of men.&mdash;If this individual &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in his cour&s;e of unthrifty profu&s;ion, &s;aying to him&s;elf, The ruin will not come in my time; the mi&s;ery will not fall upon me; let po&s;|terity take care of it&s;elf! would you not pronounce him at once very weak and very &s;elfi&s;h? My friends, a <HI>nation</HI> that &s;hould pur&s;ue the &s;ame conduct, would be equally reprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P><HI>Pride</HI> is a vice in individuals; it cannot, therefore, be a virtue in that number of in|dividuals called a Nation. A di&s;po&s;ition to prefer to every other our own habits of life, our own management, our own &s;y&s;|tems, to &s;uppo&s;e that we are admired and looked up to by others&mdash;&s;omething of this perhaps is natural, and may be pardoned as a weakne&s;s, but it can never be exalted into
<PB N="19" REF="20">
a duty; it is a di&s;po&s;ition we ought to check, and not to cultivate; there is neither patrioti&s;m nor good &s;en&s;e in fo&s;tering an ex|travagant opinion of our&s;elves and our own in&s;titutions, in being attached even to our faults, becau&s;e they are ours, and becau&s;e they have been ours from generation to ge|neration. An exclu&s;ive admiration of our|&s;elves is generally founded on extreme ig|norance, and it is not likely to produce any thing of a more liberal or better &s;tamp.</P>
<P>Among&s;t our national faults, have we any in&s;tances of <HI>cruelty</HI> or <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> to repent of? Can we look round from &s;ea to &s;ea, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and &s;ay, <HI>that our brother hath not aught again&s;t us</HI>? If &s;uch in|&s;tances do not exi&s;t under our immediate eye, do they exi&s;t any where under our in|fluence and juri&s;diction? There are &s;ome, who&s;e nerves, rather than who&s;e principles, cannot bear cruelty&mdash;like other nui&s;ances, they would not chu&s;e it in &s;ight, but they can be well content to know it exi&s;ts, and that they are indebted for it to the increa&s;e of their income, and the luxuries of their
<PB N="20" REF="21">
table. Are there not &s;ome <HI>darker-coloured</HI> children of the &s;ame family, over whom we a&s;&s;ume a hard and unju&s;t controul? And have not the&s;e our brethren <HI>aught again&s;t us</HI>? If we <HI>&s;u&s;pect</HI> they have, would it not become us anxiou&s;ly to enquire into the truth, that we may deliver our &s;ouls; but if we know it, and cannot help knowing it, if &s;uch enormities have been pre&s;&s;ed and forced upon our notice, till they are become flat and &s;tale in the public ear, from fulne&s;s and repetition, and &s;atiety of proof; and if they are &s;till &s;anctioned by our legi&s;lature, defended by our princes&mdash;deep indeed is the colour of our guilt.&mdash;And do we appoint fa&s;ts, and make pretences to religion? Do we pretend to be &s;hocked at the principles or the practices of neighbouring nations, and &s;tart with affected horror at the name of Athei&s;t? Are our con&s;ciences &s;o tender, and our hearts &s;o hard? Is it po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould meet as a nation, and knowing our&s;elves to be guilty of the&s;e things, have the confi|dence to implore the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon our commerce and our colonies: preface
<PB N="21" REF="22">
with prayer our legi&s;lative meetings, and then deliberate <HI>how long</HI> we &s;hall continue human &s;acrifices? Rather let us<Q>Never pray more, abandon all remor&s;e.</Q>Let us lay a&s;ide the grimace of hypocri&s;y, &s;tand up for what we are, and boldly pro|fe&s;s, like the emperor of old, that every thing is &s;weet from which money is extract|ed, and that we know better than to de|prive our&s;elves of a gain for the &s;ake of a fellow-creature.</P>
<P>I next invite you, my friends, to con&s;ider your conduct with regard to other &s;tates. Different communities are neighbours, liv|ing together in a &s;tate of nature; that is, without any common tribunal, to which they may carry their differences; but they are not the le&s;s bound to all the duties of neigh|bours; to mutual &s;incerity, ju&s;tice, and kind offices.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t to &s;incerity. It is imagined, I know not why, that tran&s;actions between &s;tates cannot be carried on without a great
<PB N="22" REF="23">
deal of intrigue and di&s;&s;imulation. But I am apt to think the nation that &s;hould venture to di&s;claim this narrow and crooked policy, and &s;hould act and &s;peak with a noble frank|ne&s;s, would lo&s;e nothing by the proceeding; hone&s;t intentions will bear to be told in plain language; if our views upon each other are for our mutual advantage, the whole my&s;|tery of them may be unfolded without danger; and if they are not, they will &s;oon be detected by practitioners as cunning and dextrous as our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Secondly, we are bound to ju&s;tice&mdash;Not only in executing our engagements, but in cultivating a &s;pirit of moderation in our very wi&s;hes. Mo&s;t contrary to this is a &s;pecies of patrioti&s;m, which con&s;i&s;ts in inverting the natural cour&s;e of our feelings, in being afraid of our neighbour's pro&s;perity, and re|joicing at his misfortunes. We &s;hould be a&s;hamed to &s;ay, My neighbour's hou&s;e was burnt down la&s;t night, I am glad of it, I &s;hall have more cu&s;tom to my &s;hop. My neighbour, thank God, has broken his arm, I &s;hall be &s;ent for to attend the families in
<PB N="23" REF="24">
which he was employed; but we are not a&s;hamed to &s;ay, Our neighbours are weaken|ing them&s;elves by a cruel war, we &s;hall ri&s;e upon their ruins. We mu&s;t act in oppo&s;i|tion to the peace-makers; we mu&s;t hinder them from being reconciled, and blow the coals of di&s;cord, otherwi&s;e their commerce will revive, and goods may remain in our cram|med warehou&s;es. Our neighbours have bad laws and a weak government; Heaven forbid they &s;hould change them, for then they might be more flouri&s;hing than our&s;elves. We have tracts of territory which we can|not people for ages, but we mu&s;t take great care that our neighbour does not get any footing there, for he would &s;oon make them very u&s;eful to him.&mdash;Thus do we extend our gra&s;ping hands from ea&s;t to we&s;t, from pole to pole, and in our &s;elfi&s;h monopolizing &s;pirit are almo&s;t angry that the &s;un &s;hould ripen any productions but for our markets, or the ocean bear any ve&s;&s;els but our own upon its broad bo&s;om. We are not a&s;hamed to u&s;e that &s;oleci&s;m in terms <HI>natural enemies</HI>; as if nature, and not our own bad pa&s;&s;ions, made
<PB N="24" REF="25">
us enemies; as if that relation, from which, in private life, flows confidence, af|fection, endearing intercour&s;e, were in na|tions only a &s;ignal for mutual &s;laughter; and we were like animals of prey, &s;olitarily fero|cious, who look with a jealous eye on every rival that intrudes within their range of de|va&s;tation&mdash;and yet this language is heard in a Chri&s;tian country, and the&s;e dete&s;table max|ims veil them&s;elves under the &s;emblance of virtue and public &s;pirit.&mdash;We have a golden rule, if we will but apply it; it will mea&s;ure great things as well as &s;mall; it will mea|&s;ure as true at the Antipodes, or on the coa&s;t of Guinea, as in our native fields. It is that univer&s;al &s;tandard of weights and mea&s;ures which alone will &s;implify all bu&s;i|ne&s;s: Do to others, as ye would that others &s;hould do unto you.</P>
<P>There is a notion which has a direct ten|dency to make us unju&s;t, becau&s;e it tends to make us think God &s;o; I mean the idea which mo&s;t nations have entertained, that they are the peculiar favourites of Heaven. We nouri&s;h our pride by fondly fancying
<PB N="25" REF="26">
that we are the only nation for whom the providence of God exerts it&s;elf; the only nation who&s;e form of wor&s;hip is agreeable to him, the only nation whom he has en|dowed with a competent &s;hare of wi&s;dom to frame wi&s;e laws and rational governments. Each nation is to it&s;elf the fleece of Gi|deon, and drinks exclu&s;ively the dew of &s;cience; but as God is no re&s;pecter of per|&s;ons, &s;o neither is he of nations; he has not, like earthly monarchs, his favourites. There is a great deal even in our thank&s;givings, which is exceptionable on this account; 'God, we thank thee, that we are not like other nations;'&mdash;yet we freely load our&s;elves with every degree of guilt; but then we like to con&s;ider <HI>our&s;elves</HI> as a child that is chid|den, and others as outca&s;ts.</P>
<P>When the workings of the&s;e bad pa&s;&s;ions are &s;welled to their height by mutual animo|&s;ity and oppo&s;ition, <HI>war</HI> en&s;ues. War is a &s;tate in which all our feelings and our duties &s;uffer a total and &s;trange inver&s;ion; a &s;tate, in which<Q><L>Life dies, Death lives, and Nature breeds</L>
<L>Perver&s;e, all mon&s;trous, all prodigious things.</L></Q><PB N="26" REF="27">
A &s;tate in which it becomes our bu&s;i|ne&s;s to hurt and annoy our neighbour by every po&s;&s;ible means; in&s;tead of cultivat|ing, to de&s;troy; in&s;tead of building, to pull down; in&s;tead of peopling, to depopulate; a &s;tate in which we drink the tears, and &s;eed upon the mi&s;ery of our fellow-creatures; &s;uch a &s;tate, therefore, requires the extreme&s;t nece&s;&s;ity to ju&s;tify it; it ought not to be the common and u&s;ual &s;tate of &s;ociety. As both parties <HI>cannot</HI> be in the right, there is always an equal chance, at lea&s;t, to either of them, of being in the wrong; but as both parties <HI>may</HI> be to blame, and mo&s;t commonly are, the chance is very great indeed again&s;t its be|ing entered into from any adequate cau&s;e; yet war may be &s;aid to be, with regard to na|tions, the &s;in which mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;ets them. We, my friends, in common with other nations, have much guilt to repent of from this cau&s;e, and it ought to make a large part of our humiliations on this day. When we carry our eyes back through the long records of our hi&s;tory, we &s;ee wars of plunder, wars of conque&s;t, wars of religion, wars of
<PB N="27" REF="28">
pride, wars of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, wars of idle &s;pe|culation, wars of unju&s;t interference, and hardly among them one war of nece&s;&s;ary &s;elf-defence in any of our e&s;&s;ential or very important intere&s;ts. Of late years, indeed, we have known none of the calamities of war in our own country but the wa&s;teful expence of it; and &s;itting aloof from tho&s;e circum&s;tances of per&s;onal provocation, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure might excu&s;e its fury, we have calmly voted &s;laughter and merchandi|zed de&s;truction&mdash;&s;o much blood and tears for &s;o many rupees, or dollars, or ingots. Our wars have been wars of cool calculating intere&s;t, as free from hatred as from love of mankind; the pa&s;&s;ions which &s;tir the blood have had no &s;hare in them. We devote a certain number of men to peri&s;h on land and &s;ea, and the re&s;t of us &s;leep &s;ound, and, pro|tected in our u&s;ual occupations, talk of the events of war as what diver&s;ifies the flat uniformity of life,</P>
<P>We &s;hould, therefore, do well to <HI>tran&s;late</HI> this word war into language more intelligible to us. When we pay our army and our navy
<PB N="28" REF="29">
e&s;timates, let us &s;et down&mdash;&s;o much for kill|ing, &s;o much for maiming, &s;o much for making widows and orphans, &s;o much for bringing famine upon a di&s;trict, &s;o much for corrupting citizens and &s;ubjects into &s;pies and traitors, &s;o much for ruining in|du&s;trious trade&s;men and making bankrupts, (of that &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s at lea&s;t, we <HI>can</HI> form an idea,) &s;o much for letting loo&s;e the daemons of fury rapine and lu&s;t within the fold of cultivated &s;ociety, and giving to the brutal ferocity of the mo&s;t ferocious, its full &s;cope and range of invention. We &s;hall by this means know what we have paid our money for, whether we have made a good bargain, and whether the account is likely to pa&s;s&mdash;el&s;ewhere. We mu&s;t take in too, all tho&s;e concomitant circum&s;tances which make war, con&s;idered as battle, the lea&s;t part of it&s;elf, <HI>pars minima &s;ui.</HI> We mu&s;t fix our eyes, not on the hero returning with conque&s;t, nor yet on the gallant officer dying in the bed of honour, the &s;ubject of pic|ture and of &s;ong, but on the private &s;oldier, forced into the &s;ervice, exhau&s;ted by camp|&s;ickne&s;s
<PB N="29" REF="30">
and fatigue; pale, emaciated, craw|ling to an ho&s;pital with the pro&s;pect of life, perhaps a long life, bla&s;ted, u&s;ele&s;s and &s;uffer|ing. We mu&s;t think of the uncounted tears of her who weeps alone, becau&s;e the only being who &s;hared her &s;entiments is taken from her; no martial mu&s;ic &s;ounds in uni&s;on with her feelings; the long day pa&s;&s;es and he returns not. She does not &s;hed her &s;orrows over his grave, for &s;he has never learnt whether he ever had one. If he had returned, his exertions would not have been remembered individually, for he only made a &s;mall im|perceptible part of a human machine, called a Regiment. We mu&s;t take in the long &s;ickne&s;s which no glory &s;oothes, occa&s;ioned by di&s;tre&s;s of mind, anxiety and ruined for|tunes.&mdash;The&s;e are not fancy-pictures, and if you plea&s;e to heighten them, you can every one of you do it for your&s;elves. We mu&s;t take in the con&s;equences, felt perhaps for ages, before a country which has been com|pleatly de&s;olated, lifts its head again; like a torrent of lava, its wor&s;t mi&s;chief is not the fir&s;t overwhelming ruin of towns and
<PB N="30" REF="31">
palaces, but the long &s;terility to which it con|demns the track it has covered with its &s;tream. Add the danger to regular go|vernments which are changed by war, &s;ometimes to anarchy, and &s;ometimes to de&s;poti&s;m. Add all the&s;e, and then let us think when a General performing the&s;e exploits, is &s;aluted with, "well done good and faithful &s;ervant", whether the plaudit is likely to be echoed in another place.</P>
<P>In this guilty bu&s;ine&s;s there is a circum|&s;tance which greatly aggravates its guilt, and that is the impiety of calling upon the Divine Being to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in it. Almo&s;t all nations have been in the habit of mixing with their bad pa&s;&s;ions a &s;hew of religion, and of prefacing the&s;e their murders with prayers, and the &s;olemnities of wor&s;hip. When they &s;end out their armies to de&s;o|late a country, and de&s;troy the fair face of nature, they have the pre&s;umption to hope that the &s;overeign of the univer&s;e will con|de&s;cend to be their auxiliary, and to enter into their petty and de&s;picable conte&s;ts. Their prayer, if put into plain language,
<PB N="31" REF="32">
would run thus: God of love, father of all the families of the earth, we are going to tear in pieces our brethren of mankind, but our &s;trength is not equal to our fury, we be&s;eech thee to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the work of &s;laughter. Go out we pray thee with our fleets and armies; we call them chri&s;tian, and we have interwoven in our banners and the decorations of our arms the &s;ymbols of a &s;uffering religion, that we may fight under the cro&s;s upon which our Saviour died. Whatever mi&s;chief we do, we &s;hall do it in thy name; we hope, therefore, thou wilt protect us in it. Thou, who ha&s;t made of one blood all the dwellers upon the earth, we tru&s;t thou wilt view us alone with partial favour, and enable us to bring mi&s;ery upon every other quarter of the globe&mdash;Now if we really expect &s;uch prayers to an&s;wered, we are the weake&s;t, if not, we are the mo&s;t hypocritical of beings.</P>
<P>Formerly, this bu&s;ine&s;s was managed bet|ter, and had in it more &s;hew of rea&s;on and pro|bability. When mankind conceived of their Gods as partaking of like pa&s;&s;ions with
<PB N="32" REF="33">
them&s;elves, they made a fair bargain with them on the&s;e occa&s;ions. Their chieftains, they knew, were influenced by &s;uch motives, and they thought their Gods might well be &s;o too. Go out with us, and you &s;hall have a &s;hare of the &s;poil. Your altars &s;hall &s;tream with the blood of &s;o many noble captives, or you &s;hall have a hecatomb of fat oxen, or a golden tripod. Have we any thing of this kind to propo&s;e? Can we make any thing like a <HI>hand&s;ome offer</HI> to the Al|mighty, to tempt him to enli&s;t him&s;elf on our &s;ide? Such things have been done be|fore now in the chri&s;tian world. Churches have been promi&s;ed, and church lands, aye, and hone&s;tly paid too; at other times &s;ilver &s;hrines, incen&s;e, ve&s;tments, tapers, accord|ing to the occa&s;ion.&mdash;Oh how ju&s;tly may the awful text be here applied! He that &s;itteth in the heavens &s;hall laugh, the Lord &s;hall have them in deri&s;ion.&mdash;Chri&s;tians! I &s;hudder, le&s;t in the earne&s;tne&s;s of my heart I may have &s;inned, in &s;uffering &s;uch im|pious propo&s;itions to e&s;cape my lips. In &s;hort, while we mu&s;t be perfectly con|&s;cious
<PB N="33" REF="34">
in our own minds, that the gene|rality of our wars are the offspring of mere worldly ambition and intere&s;t, let us, if we mu&s;t have wars, carry them on as other &s;uch things are carried on, and not think of mak|ing a prayer to be u&s;ed before murder, any more than of compo&s;ing prayers to be u&s;ed before we enter a gambling hou&s;e, or a place of licentious entertainment. Bad actions are made wor&s;e by hypocri&s;y; an unju&s;t war is in it&s;elf &s;o bad a thing, that there is only one way of making it wor&s;e, and that is, by mixing religion with it.</P>
<P>The&s;e, my friends, are &s;ome of the topics on which, &s;tanding as a nation this day before the Lord, it will be proper that we &s;hould examine our&s;elves. There yet re|mains a &s;erious que&s;tion: How far, as in|dividuals, are we really an&s;werable for the guilt of national &s;ins? For his own &s;ins, it is evident, every man is wholly an&s;werable; for tho&s;e of an aggregate body, it is as evi|dent he can be only an&s;werable in part; and that portion and mea&s;ure of iniquity, which falls to his &s;hare, will be more or
<PB N="34" REF="35">
le&s;s, according as he has been more or le&s;s deeply engaged in tho&s;e tran&s;actions which are polluted with it. There is an active and a pa&s;&s;ive concurrence. We give our active concurrence to any mea&s;ure, when we &s;upport it by any voluntary exertion, or be&s;tow on it any mark of approbation; when, e&s;pecially, we are the per&s;ons, for <HI>who&s;e &s;ake,</HI> and for who&s;e emolument, &s;y&s;|tems of inju&s;tice or cruelty are carried on. The man of wealth and influence, who feeds and fattens upon the mi&s;eries of his fellow|creatures; the man in power, who plans abu&s;es, or prevents their being &s;wept away, is the very Jonas of the &s;hip, and ought this day to &s;tand foremo&s;t in the rank of national penitents. But there is al&s;o a pa&s;&s;ive con|currence, and this, in common ca&s;es, the community appears to have a right to ex|pect from us. Society could not exi&s;t, if every individual took it upon him&s;elf not only to judge, but to act from his own judgment in tho&s;e things in which a nation acts collectively. The law, therefore, which is the expre&s;&s;ion of the general will, &s;eems
<PB N="35" REF="36">
to be a &s;ufficient &s;anction for us, when, in obedience to its authority, we pay taxes, and comply with injunctions, in &s;upport of mea&s;ures which we believe to be hurtful, and even iniquitous; and this, not becau&s;e the guilt of a bad action, as &s;ome fondly imagine, is diluted and wa&s;hed away in the guilt of multitudes; but becau&s;e it is a ne|ce&s;&s;ary condition of political union, that private will &s;hould be yielded up to the will of the public. We &s;hall do well, how|ever, to bear in mind the principle on which we comply, that we may not go a &s;tep be|yond it.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, ca&s;es of &s;uch atrocity, that even this concurrence would be cri|minal. What the&s;e are, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;pecify; every man mu&s;t draw the line for him&s;elf.&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e no one will pretend, that any maxims of military &s;ubordination could ju&s;tify the officers of Herod in the &s;laughter of the children of Bethlehem; and certainly the orders of Louvois, in the Palatinate, and of Catherine de Medicis, on the day of St. Bartholomew, were not le&s;s
<PB N="36" REF="37">
cruel. In our own country, it has been the official duty of magi&s;trates to burn alive quiet and innocent &s;ubjects, who differed from them in opinion. Rather than fulfil &s;uch <HI>duties,</HI> a man of integrity will prepare him&s;elf to &s;uffer, and a Chri&s;tian knows where &s;uch &s;ufferings will be rewarded.&mdash;The honourable delinquency of tho&s;e who have &s;ubmitted to be the victims, rather than the in&s;truments of inju&s;tice, has ever been held worthy of prai&s;e and admiration.</P>
<P>But though, for the &s;ake of peace and order, we ought, in general ca&s;es, to give our pa&s;&s;ive concurrence to mea&s;ures which we may think wrong, peace and order do not require us to give them the &s;anction of our approbation. On the contrary, the more &s;trictly we are bound to acquie&s;ce, the more it is incumbent on us to remon&s;trate. Every good man owes it to his country and to his own character, to lift his voice again&s;t a ruinous war, an unequal tax, or an edict of per&s;ecution: and to oppo&s;e them, tempe|perately, but firmly, by all the means in his power; and indeed this is the only way re|formations
<PB N="37" REF="38">
can ever be brought about, or that government can enjoy the advantage of general opinion.</P>
<P>This general opinion has, on a recent occa&s;ion, been &s;edulou&s;ly called for, and mo&s;t of you have complied with the requi&s;ition. You, who have, on this occa&s;ion, given warm and unqualified declarations of at|tachment to the exi&s;ting &s;y&s;tem, you have done well&mdash;You, who have denounced abu&s;es, and declared your wi&s;hes for reform, you have done well likewi&s;e, provided each of you has acted from the &s;incere, unbia&s;&s;ed conviction of his own mind. But if you have done it lightly, and without judgment, you have done ill; if again&s;t judgment, wor&s;e: if, by any improper influence, you have in|terfered with the liberty of your neighbour, or your dependant, and cau&s;ed him to act again&s;t his judgment and his con&s;cience&mdash;wor&s;e &s;till. If the ferment of party has &s;tirred up a &s;pirit of rancour and animo&s;ity among friends and town&s;men, or introduced the poi&s;on of di&s;tru&s;t amid&s;t the freedom and &s;ecurity of &s;ocial life, we &s;tand this

day before the Lord; and if our brother hath aught again&s;t us, "let us go fir&s;t, and be reconciled to our brother, and then come and offer our gift."</P>
<P>If any of us have di&s;turbed or mi&s;led weaker minds by exaggerated danger and affected alarm, and practi&s;ing on their cre|dulity or their ignorance, have rai&s;ed pa&s;|&s;ions which it would have better become us to have moderated&mdash;or if, on the other hand, we have cried, peace, peace, where there is no peace:&mdash;we are this day before the Lord, let &s;hame and remor&s;e for the&s;e practices make a di&s;tingui&s;hed part of our national humiliation.</P>
<P>Repent this day, not only of the actual evil you have done, but of the evil of which your actions have been the cau&s;e.&mdash;If you &s;lander a good man, you are an&s;werable for all the violence of which that &s;lander may be the remote cau&s;e; if you rai&s;e undue prejudices again&s;t any particular cla&s;s or de|&s;cription of citizens, and they &s;uffer through the bad pa&s;&s;ions your mi&s;repre&s;entations have worked up again&s;t them, you are an&s;werable
<PB N="39" REF="40">
for the injury, though you have not wielded the bludgeon, or applied the firebrand; if you place power in improper hands, you are an&s;werable for the abu&s;e of that power; if you oppo&s;e conciliatory mea&s;ures, you are an&s;werable for the di&s;tre&s;s which more vio|lent ones may produce. If you u&s;e intem|perate invectives and inflammatory decla|mation, you are an&s;werable if others &s;hed blood. It is not &s;ufficient, even if our in|tentions are pure; we mu&s;t weigh the ten|dencies of our actions, for we are an&s;werable, in a degree at lea&s;t, for tho&s;e remote con&s;e|quences, which, though we did not intend, we might have fore&s;een. If we inculcate the plau&s;ible doctrine of unlimited confi|dence, we draw upon our&s;elves the re&s;pon&s;i|bility of all the future mea&s;ures which that confidence may &s;anction. If we introduce tenets leaning towards arbitrary power, the generations to come will have a right to cur&s;e the folly of their forefathers, when they are reaping the bitter fruits of them in future &s;tar-chambers, and courts of inqui&s;i|torial juri&s;diction. If the precious &s;ands of
<PB N="40" REF="41">
our liberty are, perhaps, of them&s;elves run|ning out, how &s;hall we be ju&s;tified to our|&s;elves, or to po&s;terity, if, with a ra&s;h hand, we &s;hake the gla&s;s.</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, through vanity, a childi&s;h love of novelty, a &s;pirit of perver&s;e oppo&s;ition, or any motive &s;till more &s;ordidly &s;elfi&s;h, we are precipitated into mea&s;ures which ought to be the re&s;ult of the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration&mdash;if by "fooli&s;h talking or je&s;tings, which are not convenient," we have le&s;&s;ened the reverence due to con&s;ti|tuted authorities, or &s;lackened the bonds which hold &s;ociety together; ours is the blame, when the hurricane is abroad in the world, and doing its work of mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e of events in this country has now, for a number of generations, for a long reach, as it were, of the &s;tream of time, run &s;mooth, and our political duties have been proportionally ea&s;y; but it may not always be &s;o. A &s;udden bend may change the direction of the current, and open &s;cenes le&s;s calm. It becomes every man, therefore, to examine his principles,
<PB N="41" REF="42">
whether they are of that firmne&s;s and tex|ture, as &s;uits the occa&s;ion he may have for them. If we want a light gondola to float upon a &s;ummer lake, we look at the form and gilding; but if a ve&s;&s;el to &s;teer through &s;torms, we examine the &s;trength of the timbers, and the &s;oundne&s;s of the bot|tom. We want principles, not to figure in a book of ethics, or to delight us with "grand and &s;welling &s;entiments;" but prin|ciples by which we may act, and by which we may &s;uffer. Principles of benevolence, to di&s;po&s;e us to real &s;acrifices; political principles, of practical utility; principles of religion, to comfort and &s;upport us under all the trying vici&s;&s;itudes we &s;ee around us, and which we have no &s;ecurity that we &s;hall be long exempt from. How many are there now &s;uffering under &s;uch over|whelming di&s;tre&s;&s;es, as, a &s;hort time ago, we &s;hould have thought it was hardly within the verge of po&s;&s;ibility that they &s;hould ex|perience! Above all, let us keep our hearts pure, and our hands clean. Whatever part we take in public affairs, much will un|doubtedly
<PB N="42" REF="43">
happen which we could by no means fore&s;ee, and much which we &s;hall not be able to ju&s;tify; the only way, therefore, by which we can avoid deep remor&s;e, is to act with &s;implicity and &s;inglene&s;s of intention, and not to &s;uffer our&s;elves to be warped, though by ever &s;o little, from the path which ho|nour and con&s;cience approve.</P>
<P>Principles, &s;uch as I have been recom|mending, are not the work of a day; they are not to be acquired by any formal act of wor&s;hip, or manual of devotion adapted to the exigency; and it will little avail us, that we have &s;tood here, as a nation, <HI>before the Lord,</HI> if, individually, we do not re|member that we are always &s;o.</P>
