<P>AS any action or po&s;ture long conti|nued, will di&s;tort and disfigure the limbs; &s;o the mind likewi&s;e is crip|pled and contracted by perpetual application to the &s;ame &s;et of ideas. It is ea&s;y to gue&s;s the trade of an artizan by his knees, his fingers, or his &s;houlders; and there are few among men of the more liberal profe&s;&s;ions, who&s;e minds do not carry the brand of their calling, or who&s;e conver&s;ation does not quick|ly di&s;cover to what cla&s;s of the community they belong.</P>
<P>THESE peculiarities have been of great u&s;e, in the general ho&s;tility which every part of mankind exerci&s;es again&s;t the re&s;t, to fur|ni&s;h
<PB N="2" REF="3">
in&s;ults and &s;arca&s;ms. Every art has its dialect, uncouth and ungrateful to all whom cu&s;tom has not reconciled to its &s;ound, and which therefore becomes ridiculous by a &s;light mi&s;application, or unnece&s;&s;ary repetition.</P>
<P>THE general reproach with which igno|rance revenges the &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s of learning, is that of pedantry; a cen&s;ure which every man incurs, who has at any time the misfortune to talk to tho&s;e who cannot under&s;tand him, and by which the mode&s;t and timorous are &s;ometimes frighted from the di&s;play of their acqui&s;itions, and the exertion of their powers.</P>
<P>THE name of a pedant is &s;o formidable to young men when they fir&s;t fally from their colleges, and is &s;o liberally &s;cattered by tho&s;e who mean to boa&s;t their elegance of educa|tion, ea&s;ine&s;s of manners, and knowledge of the world, that it &s;eems to require particular con&s;ideration; &s;ince perhaps if it were once under&s;tood, many a heart might be freed from painful apprehen&s;ions, and many a tongue de|livered from re&s;traint.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">
PEDANTRY is the un&s;ea&s;onable o&s;tenta|tion of learning. It may be di&s;covered either in the choice of a &s;ubject, or in the manner of treating it. He is undoubtedly guilty of pedantry, who, when he has made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of &s;ome ab&s;tru&s;e and uncultivated part of knowledge, obtrudes his remarks and di&s;|coveries upon tho&s;e whom he believes unable to judge of his proficiency, and from whom as he cannot fear contradiction, he cannot pro|perly expect applau&s;e.</P>
<P>TO this error the &s;tudent is &s;ometimes be|trayed, by the natural recurrence of the mind to its common employment, by the plea&s;ure which every man receives from the recollection of plea&s;ing images, and the de&s;ire of dwelling upon topicks, on which he knows him&s;elf able to &s;peak with ju&s;tne&s;s. But, becau&s;e we are &s;eldom &s;o far prejudiced in favour of each other as to &s;earch out for palliations of fail|ings, this deviation from politene&s;s is imputed always to vanity; and the harmle&s;s collegiate, who, perhaps, intended entertainment and in|&s;truction, or at wor&s;t only &s;poke without &s;uffi|cient reflection upon the character of his
<PB N="4" REF="5">
hearers, is commonly cen&s;ured as arrogant or overbearing, and eager to extend the reputa|tion of his own accompli&s;hments, in contempt of the convenience of &s;ociety, and the laws of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>ALL di&s;cour&s;e of which others cannot par|take, is not only an irk&s;ome u&s;urpation of the time devoted to plea&s;ure and entertainment, but, what never fails to excite very keen re|&s;entment, an in&s;olent a&s;&s;ertion of &s;uperiority, and a triumph over le&s;s enlightened under|&s;tandings. The pedant is, therefore, not on|ly heard with wearine&s;s, but malignity; and tho&s;e who conceive them&s;elves in&s;ulted by his knowledge, never fail to tell with acrimony how injudiciou&s;ly it was exerted.</P>
<P>TO avoid this dangerous imputation, and recommend them&s;elves more effectually to the gay world, &s;cholars &s;ometimes dive&s;t them|&s;elves with too much ha&s;te of their academical formality, and in their endeavours to accom|modate their notions and their &s;tile to com|mon conceptions, talk rather of any thing than of that which they under&s;tand, and &s;ink
<PB N="5" REF="6">
into in&s;ipidity of &s;entiment and meanne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THERE prevails among men of letters an opinion, that all appearance of &s;cience is par|ticularly hateful to women; and that there|fore whoever de&s;ires to be well received in fe|male a&s;&s;emblies, mu&s;t qualify him&s;elf by a to|tal rejection of all that is &s;erious, rational, or important; mu&s;t con&s;ider argument or criti|ci&s;m as perpetually interdicted; and devote all his attention to trifles, and all his eloquence to compliment.</P>
<P>STUDENTS often form their notions of the pre&s;ent generation from the writings of the pa&s;t, and are not very early informed of tho&s;e changes which the gradual diffu&s;ion of knowledge, or the &s;udden caprice of fa&s;hion produces in the world. Whatever might be the &s;tate of female literature in the la&s;t cen|tury, there is now no longer any danger le&s;t the &s;cholar &s;hould want an adequate audience at the tea-table, and whoever thinks it nece&s;|&s;ary to regulate his conver&s;ation by antiquated
<PB N="6" REF="7">
rules, will be rather de&s;pi&s;ed for his futility than care&s;&s;ed for his politene&s;s.</P>
<P>TO talk intentionally in a manner above the comprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e whom we addre&s;s, is unque&s;tionable pedantry; but &s;urely com|plai&s;ance requires, that no man &s;hould, with|out proof, conclude his company incapable of following him to the highe&s;t elevation of his fancy, or the utmo&s;t extent of his knowledge. It is always &s;afer to err in favour of others than of our&s;elves, and therefore we &s;eldom ha|zard much by endeavouring to excel.</P>
<P>IT ought at lea&s;t to be the care of learning when &s;he quits her exaltation, to de&s;cend with dignity. Nothing is more de&s;picable than the airine&s;s and jocularity of a man bred to &s;evere &s;cience, and &s;olitary meditation. To trifle agreeably, is a &s;ecret which &s;chools cannot impart; that gay negligence and vivacious le|vity, which charm down re&s;i&s;tance wherever they appear, are never attainable by him who having &s;pent his fir&s;t years among the du&s;t of libraries, enters late into the living world with an unpliant attention and e&s;tabli&s;hed habits.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">
IT is ob&s;erved in the panegyrick on <HI>Fabri|cius</HI> the mechani&s;t, that, though forced by publick employments into mingled conver&s;a|tion, he never lo&s;t the mode&s;ty and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of the convent, nor drew ridicule upon him|&s;elf by an affected imitation of fa&s;hionable life. To the &s;ame prai&s;e every man devoted to learning ought to a&s;pire. If he attempts the &s;ofter arts of plea&s;ing, and endeavours to learn the graceful bow and the familiar em|brace, the in&s;inuating accent and the general &s;mile, he will lo&s;e the re&s;pect due to the cha|racter of learning, without arriving at the en|vied honour of doing nothing with elegance and facility.</P>
<P><HI>THEOPHRASTUS</HI> was di&s;covered not to be a native of <HI>Athens,</HI> by &s;o &s;trict an adhe|rence to the <HI>Attic</HI> dialect as &s;hewed that he had learned it not by cu&s;tom but by rule. A man not early formed to habitual elegance, betrays in like manner the defects of his education, by an unnece&s;&s;ary anxiety of be|haviour. It is po&s;&s;ible to become pedantick by fear of pedantry, as to be trouble&s;ome by ill|timed
<PB N="8" REF="9">
civility. There is no kind of imperti|nence more ju&s;tly cen&s;urable, than his who is always labouring to level his thoughts to in|tellects higher than his own; who apologizes for every word which his own narrowne&s;s of conver&s;e inclines him to think unu&s;ual; keeps the exuberance of his faculties under vi&s;ible re&s;traint; is &s;olicitous to anticipate enquiries by needle&s;s explanations; and endeavours to &s;hade his own abilities, le&s;t weak eyes &s;hould be dazzled with their lu&s;tre.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. RAMBLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE laws of &s;ocial benevolence require, that every man &s;hould endeavour to a&s;&s;i&s;t others by his experience. He that ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="9" REF="10">
at la&s;t e&s;caped into port from the fluctuations of chance, and the gu&s;ts of oppo&s;ition, ought to make &s;ome improvements in the chart of life, by marking the rocks on which he has been da&s;hed, and the &s;hallows where he has been &s;tranded.</P>
<P>THE error into which I was betrayed, when cu&s;tom fir&s;t gave me up to my own di|rection, is very frequently incident to the quick, the &s;prightly, the fearle&s;s and the gay; to all who&s;e ardour hurries them into preci|pitate execution of their de&s;igns, and impru|dent declaration of their opinions; who &s;el|dom count the co&s;t of plea&s;ure, or examine the di&s;tant con&s;equences of any practice that flatters them with immediate gratification.</P>
<P>I CAME forth into the crouded world with the u&s;ual juvenile ambition, and de&s;ired no|thing beyond the title of a wit. Money I con|&s;idered as below my care; for I &s;aw &s;uch multitudes grow rich without under&s;tanding, that I could not forbear to look on wealth as an acqui&s;ition ea&s;y to indu&s;try directed by ge|nius, and therefore threw it a&s;ide as a &s;econ|dary convenience, to be procured when my
<PB N="10" REF="11">
principal wi&s;h &s;hould be &s;atisfied, and my claim to intellectual excellence univer&s;ally ac|knowledged.</P>
<P>WITH this view, I regulated my beha|viour in publick, and exerci&s;ed my medita|tions in &s;olitude. My life was divided be|tween the care of providing topicks for the entertainment of my company, and that of collecting company worthy to be entertained; for I &s;oon found, that wit like every other power, has its boundaries; that its &s;ucce&s;s de|pends upon the aptitude of others to receive impre&s;&s;ions; and that as &s;ome bodies, indi&s;|&s;oluble by heat, can &s;et the furnace and cru|cible at defiance, there are minds upon which the rays of fancy may be pointed without ef|fect, and which no fire of &s;entiment can agi|tate or exalt.</P>
<P>IT was, however, not long before I &s;itted my&s;elf with a &s;et of companions, who knew how to laugh, and to whom no other recom|mendation was nece&s;&s;ary than the power of &s;triking out a je&s;t. Among tho&s;e, I fixed my re&s;idence, and for a time enjoyed the felicity of di&s;turbing the neighbours every night, with
<PB N="11" REF="12">
the ob&s;treperous applau&s;e which my &s;allies forced from the audience. The reputation of our club every day increa&s;ed, and as my flights and remarks were circulated by my admirers, every day brought new &s;olicitations for admi&s;|&s;ion into our &s;ociety.</P>
<P>TO &s;upport this perpetual fund of merri|ment, I frequented every place of concour&s;e, cultivated the acquaintance of all the fa&s;hion|able race, and pa&s;&s;ed the day in a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of vi&s;its, in which I collected a trea|&s;ure of plea&s;antry for the expences of the even|ing. Whatever error of conduct I could di&s;|cover, whatever peculiarity of manner I could ob&s;erve, whatever weakne&s;s was betrayed by confidence, whatever lap&s;e was &s;uffered by neglect, all was drawn together for the diver|&s;ion of my wild companions, who, when they had been taught the art of ridicule, never fail|ed to &s;ignalize them&s;elves by a zealous imita|tion, and filled the town on the en&s;uing day, with &s;candal and vexation, with merriment and &s;hame.</P>
<P>I CAN &s;carcely believe, when I recollect my own practice, that I could have been &s;o far
<PB N="12" REF="13">
deluded with trivial prai&s;e, as to divulge the &s;ecrets of con&s;ultation, and to expo&s;e the levities of frankne&s;s; to waylay the walks of the cautious, and &s;urprize the &s;ecurity of the thoughtle&s;s. Yet it is certain, that for many years I heard nothing but with de&s;ign to tell it, and &s;aw nothing with any other cu|rio&s;ity than after &s;ome failure that might fur|ni&s;h out a je&s;t.</P>
<P>MY heart, indeed, acquits me of deliberate malignity, or intere&s;ted in&s;idiou&s;ne&s;s. I had no other purpo&s;e than to heighten the plea&s;ure of laughter by communication, nor ever rai&s;|ed any pecuniary advantage from the calami|ties of others. I led weakne&s;s and negligence into difficulties, only that I might divert my|&s;elf with their perplexities and di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and violated every law of friend&s;hip with no other hope, than that of gaining the reputation of &s;martne&s;s and waggery.</P>
<P>I WOULD not be under&s;tood to charge my|&s;elf with any crimes of the atrocious or de|&s;tructive kind. I never betrayed an heir to game&s;ters, or a girl to debauchees, never in|tercepted the kindne&s;s of a patron, or &s;ported
<PB N="13" REF="14">
away the reputation of innocence. My de|light was only in petty mi&s;chief, and momen|tary vexations; and my acutene&s;s was em|ployed not upon fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion which it had been meritorious to detect, but upon harmle&s;s ignorance or ab&s;urdity, prejudice or mi&s;take.</P>
<P>THIS enquiry I pur&s;ued with &s;o much di|ligence and &s;agacity, that I was able to relate of every man whom I knew &s;ome blunder or mi&s;carriage; to betray the mo&s;t circum&s;pect of my friends into follies, by a judicious flat|tery of his predominant pa&s;&s;ion; or expo&s;e him to contempt, by placing him in circum|&s;tances which put his prejudices into action, brought to view his natural defects, or drew the attention of the company on his airs of affectation.</P>
<P>THE power had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in vain if it had never been exerted; and it was not my cu&s;tom to let any arts of jocularity remain unemployed. My impatience of applau&s;e brought me always early to the place of en|tertainment; and I &s;eldom failed to lay a
<PB N="14" REF="15">
&s;cheme with the &s;mall knot that fir&s;t gathered round me, by which &s;ome of tho&s;e whom we expected might be made &s;ub&s;ervient to our &s;port. Every man has &s;ome favourite topick of conver&s;ation, on which, by a feigned &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s of attention, he may be drawn to ex|patiate without end. Every man has &s;ome habitual contortion of body, or e&s;tabli&s;h|ed mode of expre&s;&s;ion, which never fails to rai&s;e mirth if it be pointed out to notice. By premonitions of the&s;e particularities I &s;e|cured our plea&s;antry. Our companion en|tered with his u&s;ual gaiety, and began to par|take of our noi&s;y chearfulne&s;s, when the con|ver&s;ation was imperceptibly diverted to a &s;ub|ject which pre&s;&s;ed upon his tender part, and extorted the expected &s;hrug, the cu&s;tomary exclamation, or the predicted remark. A ge|neral clamour of joy then bur&s;t from all that were admitted to the &s;tratagem. Our mirth was often encrea&s;ed by the triumph of him that occa&s;ioned it; for as we do not ha&s;tily &s;orm conclu&s;ions again&s;t our&s;elves, &s;eldom any one &s;u&s;pected, that he had exhilarated us otherwi&s;e than by his wit.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">
YOU will hear I believe with very little &s;urprize, that by this conduct I had in a &s;hort time united mankind again&s;t me, and that every tongue was diligent in prevention or revenge. I &s;oon perceived my&s;elf regarded with malevolence or di&s;tru&s;t, but wondered what had been di&s;covered in me either terri|ble or hateful. I had invaded no man's pro|perty; I had rivalled no man's claims; not had ever engaged in any of tho&s;e attempts which provoke the jealou&s;y of ambition, or the rage of faction. I had lived but to laugh, and make others laugh; and believed that I was loved by all who care&s;&s;ed, and favoured by all who applauded me. I never imagined, that he who in the mirth of a nocturnal revel, concurred in ridiculing his friend, would con|&s;ider in a cooler hour, that the &s;ame trick might be played again&s;t him&s;elf; or that, even where there is no &s;en&s;e of danger, the natural pride of human nature ri&s;es again&s;t him, who by general cen&s;ures lays claim to general &s;uperiority.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">
I WAS convinced by a total de&s;ertion, of the impropriety of my conduct; every man avoided and cautioned others to avoid me. Wherever I came, I found &s;ilence and dejec|tion, coldne&s;s and terror. No one would ven|ture to &s;peak, le&s;t he &s;hould lay him&s;elf open to unfavourable repre&s;entations; the compa|ny however numerous dropped off at my en|trance upon various pretences; and if I re|tired to avoid the &s;hame of being left, I heard confidence and mirth revive at my departure.</P>
<P>IF tho&s;e whom I had thus offended, could have contented them&s;elves with repaying one in&s;ult for another, and kept up the war only by a reciprocation of &s;arca&s;ms, they might have perhaps vexed, but would never much have hurt me; for no man heartily hates him at whom he can laugh. But the&s;e wounds which they give me as they fly, are without cure; this alarm which they &s;pread by their &s;olicitude to e&s;cape me, excludes me from all friend&s;hip and from all plea&s;ure: I am con|demned to pa&s;s a long interval of my life in &s;olitude, as a man &s;u&s;pected of infection is refu&s;ed admi&s;&s;ion into cities; and mu&s;t linger
<PB N="17" REF="18">
in ob&s;curity, till my conduct &s;hall convince the world, that I may be approached with|out hazard.</P>

<P>NONE of the axioms of wi&s;dom which recommend the ancient &s;ages to vene|ration, &s;eems to have required le&s;s extent of knowledge or per&s;picacity of penetration than the remark of <HI>Bias,</HI> that <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>the majority are wicked.</HI></P>
<P>THE depravity of mankind is &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;|coverable, that nothing but the de&s;ert or the cell can exclude it from notice. The know|ledge of crimes intrudes uncalled and unde|&s;ired. They whom their ab&s;traction from
<PB N="18" REF="19">
common occurrences hinders from &s;eeing ini|quity, will quickly have their attention awakened by feeling it. Even he who ven|tures not into the world, may learn its cor|ruption in his clo&s;et. For what are treati&s;es of morality, but per&s;ua&s;ives to the practice of duties, for which no arguments would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, but that we are continually tempted to violate or neglect them? What are all the records of hi&s;tory, but narratives of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive villanies, of trea&s;ons and u&s;urpations, ma&s;|&s;acres and wars?</P>
<P>BUT, perhaps, the excellence of aphori&s;ms con&s;i&s;ts not &s;o much in the expre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome rare or ab&s;tru&s;e &s;entiment, as in the compre|hen&s;ion of &s;ome obvious and u&s;eful truth in a few words. We frequently fall into error and folly, not becau&s;e the true principles of action are not known, but becau&s;e, for a time, they are not remembered; and he may there|fore be ju&s;tly numbered among the benefactors of mankind, who contracts the great rules of life into &s;hort &s;entences, that may be ea&s;ily impre&s;&s;ed on the memory, and taught by fre|quent recollection to recur habitually to the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">
HOWEVER tho&s;e who have pa&s;&s;ed through half the life of man, may now wonder that any &s;hould require to be cautioned again&s;t corruption, they will find, that they have them&s;elves purcha&s;ed their conviction by ma|ny di&s;appointments and vexations, which an earlier knowledge would have &s;pared them; and may &s;ee on every &s;ide &s;ome intangling them&s;elves in perplexities, and &s;ome &s;inking into ruin, by ignorance or neglect of the maxim of <HI>Bias.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY day &s;ends out, in que&s;t of plea&s;ure and di&s;tinction, &s;ome heir fondled in igno|rance, and flattered into pride. He comes forth with all the confidence of a &s;pirit un|acquainted with &s;uperiors, and all the bene|volence of a mind not yet irritated by oppo|&s;ition, alarmed by fraud, or imbittered by cru|elty. He loves all, becau&s;e he imagines him|&s;elf the univer&s;al favourite. Every exchange of &s;alutation produces new acquaintance, and every acquaintance kindles into friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>EVERY &s;ea&s;on brings a new flight of beau|ties into the world, who have hitherto heard
<PB N="20" REF="21">
only of their own charms, and imagine that the heart feels no pa&s;&s;ion but that of love. They are &s;oon &s;urrounded by admirers whom they credit, becau&s;e they tell them only what is heard with delight. Whoever gazes upon them is a lover; and whoever forces a &s;igh, is pining in de&s;pair.</P>
<P>HE &s;urely is an u&s;eful monitor, who incul|cates to the&s;e thoughtle&s;s &s;trangers, that the <HI>majority are wicked</HI>; who informs them, that the train which wealth and beauty draw after them, is lured only by the &s;cent of prey; and that, perhaps, among all tho&s;e who croud about them with profe&s;&s;ions and flatteries, there is not one who does not hope for &s;ome opportunity to devour or betray them, to glut him&s;elf by their de&s;truction, or to &s;hare their &s;poils with a &s;tronger &s;avage.</P>
<P>VIRTUE pre&s;ented &s;ingly to the imagina|tion or the rea&s;on, is &s;o well recommended by its own graces, and &s;o &s;trongly &s;upported by arguments, that a good man wonders how any can be bad; and they who are yet igno|rant of the force of pa&s;&s;ion and intere&s;t, who never ob&s;erved the arts of &s;eduction, the con|tagion

<P>IT is indeed impo&s;&s;ible not to hear from tho&s;e who have lived longer, of wrongs and &s;al&s;hoods, of violence and circumvention; but &s;uch narratives are commonly regarded by the young, the heady, and the confident, as no|thing more than the murmurs of peevi&s;hne&s;s, or the dreams of dotage; and notwith&s;tand|ing all the documents of hoary wi&s;dom, we commonly plunge into the world fearle&s;s and credulous, without any fore&s;ight of danger, or apprehen&s;ion of deceit.</P>
<P>I HAVE remarked in a former paper, that credulity is the common failing of unexpe|rienced virtue; and that he who is &s;pontane|ou&s;ly &s;u&s;picious, may be ju&s;tly charged with radical corruption; for if he has not known the preval<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nce of di&s;hone&s;ty by information, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">me to ob&s;erve it with his own eyes, whence can he take his mea&s;ures of judgment but from him&s;elf?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23">
THEY who be&s;t de&s;erve to e&s;cape the &s;nares of artifice, are mo&s;t likely to be entangled. He that endeavours to live for the good of others, mu&s;t always be ex|po&s;ed to the arts of them who live only for them&s;elves, unle&s;s he is taught by timely pre|cepts the caution required in common tran&s;|actions, and &s;hown at a di&s;tance the pitfals of treachery.</P>
<P>TO youth, therefore, it &s;hould be carefully inculcated, that to enter the road of life without caution or re&s;erve, in expectation of general fidelity and ju&s;tice, is to laucnh on the wide ocean without the in&s;truments of &s;teer|age, and to hope, that every wind will be pro&s;perous, and that every coa&s;t will afford a harbour.</P>
<P>TO ennumerate the various motives to de|ceit and injury, would be to count all the de|&s;ires that prevail among the &s;ons of men; &s;ince there is no ambition however petty, no wi&s;h however ab&s;urd, that by indulgence will not be enabled to overpower the influ|ence of virtue. Many there are, who openly and almo&s;t profe&s;&s;edly regulate all their con|duct
<PB N="23" REF="24">
by their love of money; who have no rea&s;on for action or forbearance, for com|pliance or refu&s;al, than that they hope to gain more by one than by the other. The&s;e are indeed the meane&s;t and cruele&s;t of human beings, a race with whom, as with &s;ome pe|&s;tiferous animals, the whole creation &s;eems to be at war; but who, however dete&s;ted or &s;corned, long continue to add heap to heap, and when they have reduced one to beggary are &s;till permitted to fa&s;ten on another.</P>
<P>OTHERS, yet le&s;s rationally wicked, pa&s;s their lives in mi&s;chief becau&s;e they cannot bear the &s;ight of &s;ucce&s;s, and mark out every man for hatred, who&s;e &s;ame or fortune they believe encrea&s;ing.</P>
<P>MANY, who have not advanced to the&s;e degrees of guilt, are yet wholly unqualified for friend&s;hip, and unable to maintain any con&s;tant or regular cour&s;e of kindne&s;s. Hap|pine&s;s may be de&s;troyed not only by union with the man who is apparently the &s;lave of intere&s;t, but with him whom a wild opinion of the dignity of per&s;everance in whatever

cau&s;e di&s;po&s;es to per&s;ue every injury with un|wearied and perpetual re&s;entment; with him who&s;e vanity inclines him to con&s;ider every man as a rival in every preten&s;ion; with him who&s;e airy negligence puts his friend's affairs or &s;ecrets in continual hazard, and who thinks his forgetfulne&s;s of others excu&s;ed by his inat|tention to him&s;elf; or with him who&s;e incon|&s;tancy ranges without any &s;ettled rule of choice through varieties of friend&s;hip, and who adopts and di&s;mi&s;&s;es favourites by the &s;udden impul&s;e of caprice.</P>
<P>THUS numerous are the difficulties to which the conver&s;e of mankind expo&s;es us, and which can be avoided only by prudent di&s;tru&s;t.

<P>THERE are many vexatious accidents and unea&s;y &s;ituations which rai&s;e lit|tle compa&s;&s;ion for the &s;ufferer, and which no man but tho&s;e whom they immediately di|&s;tre&s;s, can regard with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. Petty mi&s;chiefs, that have no influence on futu|rity, nor extend their effects to the re&s;t of life, are always &s;een with a kind of malicious plea&s;ure. A mi&s;take or embarra&s;ment, which for the pre&s;ent moment fills the face with blu&s;hes, and the mind with confu&s;ion, will have no other effect upon tho&s;e who ob&s;erve it than that of convul&s;ing them with irre|&s;i&s;tible laughter. Some circum&s;tances of mi|&s;ery are &s;o powerfully ridiculous, that neither kindne&s;s nor duty can with&s;tand them; they bear down love, intere&s;t, and reverence, and force the friend, the dependent or the child, to give way to in&s;tantaneous motions of mer|riment.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27">
AMONG the principal of comick calami|ties, may be reckoned the pain which an au|thor, not yet hardened into in&s;en&s;ibility, feels at the on&s;et of a furious critick, who&s;e age, rank or fortune gives him confidence to &s;peak without re&s;erve; who heaps one objection upon another, and obtrudes his remarks, and enforces his corrections without tenderne&s;s or awe.</P>
<P>THE author, full of the importance of his work, alarmed at the danger of his cha|racter, and anxious for the ju&s;tification of every &s;yllable, &s;tarts and kindles at the &s;lighte&s;t attack; the critick, eager to e&s;ta|bli&s;h his &s;uperiority, triumphing in every di&s;|covery of failure, and zealous to impre&s;s the cogency of his arguments, pur&s;ues him from line to line without ce&s;&s;ation or remor&s;e. The critick, who hazards little, proceeds with vehemence impetuo&s;ity and fearle&s;&s;ne&s;s; the author who&s;e quiet and fame, and life and immortality are involved in the contro|ver&s;y, tries every art of &s;ubterfuge and de|fence; maintains mode&s;tly what he re&s;olves never to yield, and yields unwillingly what
<PB N="27" REF="28">
cannot be maintained. The critick's purpo&s;e is to conquer, the author only hopes to e&s;cape; the critick therefore knits his brow, and rai&s;es his voice, and rejoyces whenever he perceives any tokens of pain excited by the pre&s;&s;ure of his a&s;&s;ertions, or the point of his &s;arca&s;ms. The author, who&s;e endeavour is at once to mollify and elude his per&s;ecutor, compo&s;es his features, and &s;oftens his accent, breaks the force of a&s;&s;ault by retreat, and ra|ther &s;teps a&s;ide than flies or advances.</P>
<P>AS it very &s;eldom happens that the rage of extemporary critici&s;m inflicts fatal or la&s;ting wounds, I know not that the Laws of bene|volence entitle this di&s;tre&s;s to much &s;ympathy. The diver&s;ion of baiting an author has the &s;anction of all ages and nations, and is more lawful than the &s;port of teizing other ani|mals, becau&s;e for the mo&s;t part he comes vo|luntarily to the &s;take, furni&s;hed, as he ima|gines, by the patron powers of literature with re&s;i&s;tle&s;s weapons and impenetrable ar|mour, with the mail of the boar of <HI>Ery|manth,</HI> and the paws of the lion of <HI>Nemea.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">
BUT the works of genius are &s;ometimes produced by other motives than vanity; and he whom nece&s;&s;ity or duty enforces to write, is not always &s;o well &s;atisfied with him&s;elf as not to be di&s;couraged by cen&s;orious impu|dence. It may therefore be nece&s;&s;ary to con|&s;ider by what mea&s;ures they whom the pub|lication of their names lays open to the in|&s;ults of &s;uch as their ob&s;curity &s;ecures again&s;t repri&s;als, may extricate them&s;elves from un|expected encounters.</P>
<P><HI>VIDA,</HI> a man of con&s;iderable &s;kill in the politicks of literature, directs his pupil wholly to abandon his defence, and even when he can irrefragably refute all objections, to &s;uffer tamely the exultations of his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS rule may perhaps be ju&s;t, when ad|vice is a&s;ked and &s;everity &s;olicited, becau&s;e no man tells his opinion &s;o freely as when he imagines it received with implicit veneration; and critics ought never to be con&s;ulted but while errors may yet be rectified or in&s;i|pidity &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. But when the book has once been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed into the world, and can
<PB N="29" REF="30">
be no more retouched, I know not whether a very different conduct &s;hould not be pre|&s;cribed, and whether firmne&s;s and &s;pirit may not &s;ometimes be of u&s;e to overpower arro|gance and repel brutality. Softne&s;s, diffidence and moderation will often be mi&s;taken for imbecillity and dejection; they lure cow|ardice to the attack by the hopes of ea&s;y vic|tory, and it will &s;oon be found that he whom every man thinks he can conquer, &s;hall never be at peace.</P>
<P>THE animadver&s;ions of criticks are com|monly &s;uch as may ea&s;ily provoke the &s;edate&s;t writer to &s;ome quickne&s;s of re&s;entment and a&s;perity of reply. A man who by long con|&s;ideration has familiari&s;ed a &s;ubject to his own mind, carefully &s;urvey'd the &s;eries of his thoughts, and planned all the parts of his compo&s;ition into a regular dependance on each other, will often &s;tart at the &s;ini&s;trous interpretations, or ab&s;urd remarks of ha&s;te and ignorance, and wonder by what infatua|tion they have been led away from the ob|vious

&s;en&s;e, and upon what peculiar princi|ples of judgment they decide again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THE eye of the intellect, like that of the body, is not equally perfect in all, nor equal|ly adapted in any to all objects; the end of critici&s;m is to &s;upply its defects; rules are the in&s;truments of mental vi&s;ion, which may in|deed a&s;&s;i&s;t our faculties when properly u&s;ed, but produce confu&s;ion and ob&s;curity by un|&s;kilful application.</P>
<P>SOME &s;eem always to read with the mi|cro&s;cope of critici&s;m, and employ their whole attention upon minute elegance, or faults &s;carcely vi&s;ible to common ob&s;ervation.

As they di&s;cern with great exactne&s;s, they comprehend but a narrow compa&s;s, and know nothing of the ju&s;tne&s;s of the de&s;ign, the general &s;pirit of the performance, the artifice of connection,

or the harmony of the parts; they never conceive how &s;mall a proportion that which they are bu&s;y in contemplating bears to the whole, or how the trivial inaccuracies with which they are offended, are ab&s;orbed and lo&s;t in general excellence.</P>
<P>OTHERS are furni&s;hed by critici&s;m with a tele&s;cope. They &s;ee with great clearne&s;s whatever is too remote to be di&s;covered by the re&s;t of mankind, but are totally blind to all that lies immediately before them. They di&s;cover in every pa&s;&s;age &s;ome &s;ecret mean|ing, &s;ome remote allu&s;ion, &s;ome artful al|legory, or &s;ome occult imitation which no other reader ever &s;u&s;pected; but they have no perception of the cogency of arguments, the contexture of narrations, the various co|lours of diction, or the flowery embelli&s;h|ments of fancy; of all that engages the at|tention of others, they are totally in&s;en&s;ible, while they pry into worlds of conjecture, and amu&s;e them&s;elves with phantoms in the clouds.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN, after the u&s;ual time &s;pent at the univer&s;ity, I was about to enter upon the profe&s;&s;ion to which my friends had de&s;tined me, being &s;ummoned by the death of my father, into the country, I found my&s;elf ma&s;ter of an unexpected &s;um of money, and of an e&s;tate, which, though not large, was, in my opinion, &s;ufficient to &s;upport me in a condition far preferable to the fatigue, dependence, and uncertainty of any gainful occupation. I therefore, re&s;olved
<PB N="33" REF="34">
to devote the re&s;t of my life wholly to curi|o&s;ity, and without any confinement of my excur&s;ions or termination of my views, to wander over the boundle&s;s regions of general knowledge.</P>
<P>THIS &s;cheme of life &s;eemed pregnant with inexhau&s;tible variety, and therefore, I could not forbear to congratulate my&s;elf upon the wi&s;dom of my choice. I furni&s;h'd a large room with all conveniencies for &s;tudy; col|lected books of every kind; quitted every &s;cience at the fir&s;t perception of di&s;gu&s;t; re|turned to it again as &s;oon as my former ar|dour happened to revive; and having no ri|val to depre&s;s me by compari&s;on, nor any critic to alarm me with objections, I &s;pent day after day in profound tranquility, with only &s;o much complacence in my own im|provements, as &s;erved to excite and animate my application.</P>
<P>THUS I lived for &s;ome years with com|plete acquie&s;cence in my own plan of con|duct, ri&s;ing early to read, and dividing the latter part of the day between oeconomy, exerci&s;e and reflection. But in time, I be|gan
<PB N="34" REF="35">
to find my mind contracted and &s;tiffened by &s;olitude. My ea&s;e and elegance were &s;en|&s;ibly impaired; I was no longer able to ac|commodate my&s;elf with readine&s;s to the ac|cidental current of conver&s;ation; my notions grew particular and paradoxical; and my phra&s;eology formal and unfa&s;hionable; I &s;poke, on common occa&s;ions, the language of books. My quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, and celerity of reply had entirely de&s;erted me: When I delivered my opinion, or detailed my know|ledge, I was bewildered by an un&s;ea&s;onable interrogatory, di&s;concerted by any trivial ob|jection, and overwhelmed, and lo&s;t in de|jection when the &s;malle&s;t advantage was gain|ed again&s;t me in di&s;pute. I became deci&s;ive and dogmatical, impatient of contradiction, perpetually jealous of my character, in&s;olent to &s;uch as acknowledged my &s;uperiority, and &s;ullen and malignant to all who refu&s;ed to re|ceive my dictates.</P>
<P>THIS I &s;oon di&s;covered to be one of tho&s;e intellectual di&s;ea&s;es which a wi&s;e man &s;hould make ha&s;te to cure. I therefore re&s;olved for a time to &s;hut my books, and learn again the
<PB N="35" REF="36">
art of conver&s;ation; to defecate and clear my mind by bri&s;ker motions and &s;tronger im|pul&s;es; and to unite my&s;elf once more to the living generation.</P>
<P>FOR this purpo&s;e I ha&s;ted to <HI>London,</HI> and entreated one of my academical acquain|tances, to introduce me into &s;ome of the little &s;ocieties of literature which are formed in ta|verns and coffee-hou&s;es. He was plea&s;ed with an opportunity of &s;hewing me to his friends, and &s;oon obtained me admi&s;&s;ion among a &s;elect company of curious men, who met once a week to exhilarate their &s;tu|dies and compare their acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>THE elde&s;t and mo&s;t venerable of this &s;o|ciety was <HI>Hir&s;utus,</HI> who after the fir&s;t civi|lities of my reception, &s;ound means to in|troduce the mention of his favourite &s;tudies, by a &s;evere cen&s;ure of tho&s;e who want the due regard for their native country. He in|formed me, that he had early withdrawn his attention from foreign trifles, and that &s;ince he begun to addict his mind to &s;erious and manly &s;tudies, he had very carefully ama&s;&s;ed all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> books that were printed in
<PB N="36" REF="37">
the black character. This &s;earch he had pur|&s;ued &s;o diligently, that he was able to &s;how the deficiencies of the be&s;t catalogues. He had long &s;ince completed his <HI>Caxton,</HI> had three &s;heets of <HI>Treveris</HI> unknown to the antiqua|ries, and wanted to a perfect <HI>Pyn&s;on</HI> but two volumes, of which one was promi&s;ed him as a legacy by its pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and the other he was re&s;olved to buy, at whatever price, when <HI>Qui&s;quilius</HI>'s library &s;hould be &s;old. <HI>Hir&s;utus</HI> had no other rea&s;on for the valuing or &s;lighting a book, than that it was printed in the <HI>Roman</HI> or the <HI>Gothick</HI> letter, nor any ideas but &s;uch as his favourite volumes had &s;upplied; when he was &s;erious, he expatiated on the narratives of <HI>Johan de Trevi&s;a,</HI> and, when he was merry, regaled us with a quo|tation from the <HI>Shippe of Foles.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE I was li&s;tening to this hoary &s;tu|dent, <HI>Ferratus</HI> entered in a hurry, and in|formed us with the abruptne&s;s of exta&s;y, that his &s;et of half-pence was now complete; he had ju&s;t received in a handful of change, the piece that he had &s;o long been &s;eeking,
<PB N="37" REF="38">
and could now defy mankind to outgo his collection of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> copper.</P>
<P><HI>CHARTOPHYLAX</HI> then ob&s;erved how fatally human &s;agacity was &s;ometimes baffled, and how often the mo&s;t valuable di&s;coveries are made by chance. He had employed him|&s;elf and his emi&s;&s;aries &s;even years at great ex|pence, to perfect his &s;eries of <HI>Gazettes,</HI> but had long wanted a &s;ingle paper, which, when he de&s;paired of obtaining it, was &s;ent him wrapped round a parcel of tobacco.</P>
<P><HI>CANTILENUS</HI> turned all his thoughts upon old ballads, for he con&s;idered them as the genuine records of the national ta&s;te. He offered to &s;hew me a copy of <HI>The Children in the Wood,</HI> which he firmly believed to be of the fir&s;t edition, and by the help of which, the text might be freed from &s;everal corrup|tions, if this age of barbarity had any claim to &s;uch favours from him.</P>
<P>MANY were admitted into this &s;ociety, as inferior members, becau&s;e they had collected old prints and neglected pamphlets, or po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome fragment of antiquity, as the &s;eal
<PB N="38" REF="39">
of an antient corporation, the charter of a religious hou&s;e, the genealogy of a family extinct, or a letter written in the reign of <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY one of the&s;e virtuo&s;os looked on all his a&s;&s;ociates as wretches of depraved ta&s;te and narrow notions. Their conver&s;ation was, therefore, fretful and wa&s;pi&s;h, their be|haviour brutal, their merriment bluntly &s;ar|ca&s;tick, and their &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s gloomy and &s;u&s;|picious. They were totally ignorant of all that pa&s;&s;es, or has lately pa&s;&s;ed, in the world; unable to di&s;cu&s;s any que&s;tion of religious, political, or military knowledge; equally &s;trangers to &s;cience and politer learning, and without any wi&s;h to improve their minds, or any other plea&s;ure than that of di&s;playing ra|rities, of which they would not &s;uffer others to make the proper u&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>HIRSUTUS</HI> graciou&s;ly informed me, that the number of their &s;ociety was limited, but that I might &s;ometimes attend as an au|ditor. I was plea&s;ed to find my&s;elf in no danger of an honour, which I could not have willingly accepted, nor gracefully re|fu&s;ed,
<PB N="39" REF="40">
and left them without any intention of returning, for I &s;oon found, that the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e habits with which I was vitiated, required a&s;&s;ociation with men very different from this &s;olemn race.</P>

<P>IT is natural to feel grief or indignation, when any thing, nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful, is wan|tonly wa&s;ted, or negligently de&s;troyed; and therefore, my corre&s;pondent cannot be blamed for looking with unea&s;ine&s;s on the wa&s;te of life. Lei&s;ure and curio&s;ity might &s;oon make great advances in u&s;eful knowledge, were they not diverted by trivial emulation and laborious trifles. It may, however, &s;ome|what molli&s;y his anger to reflect, that per|haps, none of the a&s;&s;embly which he de|&s;cribes, was capable of any nobler employ|ment, and that he who does his be&s;t, how|ever little, is always to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from

him who does nothing. Whatever bu&s;ies the mind without corrupting it, has at lea&s;t this u&s;e, that it re&s;cues the day from idle|ne&s;s, and he that is never idle will not often be vitious.</P>

<P>PROVIDENCE has fixed the limits of hu|man enjoyment by immoveable boundaries, and has &s;et different gratifications at &s;uch a di&s;tance from each other, that no art or power can bring them together.

<P>IT may be ob&s;erved in general, that the future is purcha&s;ed by the pre&s;ent. It is not po&s;&s;ible to &s;ecure di&s;tant or permanent hap|pine&s;s but by the forbearance of &s;ome imme|diate gratification. This is &s;o evidently true with regard to the whole of our exi&s;tence, that all the precepts of theology have no other tendency than to enforce a life of faith; a life regulated not by our &s;en&s;es but our belief; a life in which plea&s;ures are to be refu&s;ed for fear of invi&s;ible puni&s;hments, and calamities &s;ometimes to be fought and always endured in hope of rewards that &s;hall be ob|tained in another &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45">
EVEN if we take into our view only that particle of our duration which is terminated by the grave, it will be found that we cannot enjoy one part of life beyond the common limitations of plea&s;ure, but by anticipating &s;ome of the &s;atisfaction which &s;hould exhila|rate the following years. The heat of youth may &s;pread happine&s;s into wild luxuriance, but the radical vigour requi&s;ite to make it peren|nial is exhau&s;ted, and all that can be hoped afterwards is languor and &s;terility.</P>
<P>THE reigning error of manking is, that we are not content with the conditions on which the goods of life are granted. No man is in&s;en&s;ible of the value of knowledge, the advantages of health, or the convenience of plenty, but every day &s;hews us tho&s;e on whom their conviction is without effect.</P>
<P>KNOWLEDGE is prai&s;ed and de&s;ired by multitudes whom her charms could never rou&s;e from the couch of &s;loth; whom the fainte&s;t invitation of plea&s;ure draws away from their &s;tudies; to whom any other me|thod of wearing out the day is more eligible than the u&s;e of books, and who are more
<PB N="45" REF="46">
ea&s;ily engaged by any conver&s;ation than &s;uch as may rectify their notions or enlarge their comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>EVERY man that has felt pain knows how little all other comforts can gladden him to whom health is denied. Yet who is there does not &s;ometimes hazard it for the enjoyment of an hour? All a&s;&s;emblies of jollity, all places of publick entertainment exhibit examples of &s;trength wa&s;ting in riot, and beauty wi|thering in irregularity; nor is it ea&s;y to enter a hou&s;e in which part of the family is not groaning in repentance of pa&s;t intemperance, and part admitting di&s;ca&s;e by negligence, or &s;oliciting it by luxury.</P>
<P>THERE is no plea&s;ure which men of every age and &s;ect have more generally agreed to mention with contempt, than the gratifica|tions of the palate; an entertainment &s;o far removed from intellectual happine&s;s that &s;carcely the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s of the &s;en&s;ual herd have dared to defend it; yet even to this, the lowe&s;t of our delights, to this, though neither quick nor la&s;ting, is health with all its activity and &s;prightline&s;s daily &s;acrificed; and
<PB N="46" REF="47">
for this are half the mi&s;eries endured which urge impatience to call on death.</P>
<P>THE whole world is put in motion by the wi&s;h for riches, and the dread of poverty. Who, then, would not imagine that &s;uch conduct as will inevitably de&s;troy what all are thus labouring to acquire, mu&s;t generally be avoided? That he who &s;pends more than he receives, mu&s;t in time become indigent cannot be doubted; but how evident &s;oever this con&s;equence may appear, the &s;pendthri&s;t moves in the whirl of plea&s;ure with too much rapidity to keep it before his eyes, and in the intoxication of gaiety grows every day poorer without any &s;uch &s;en&s;e of approaching ruin as is &s;ufficient to wake him into caution.</P>
<P>MANY complaints are made of the mi&s;ery of life; and indeed it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that we are &s;ubject to calamities by which the good and bad, the diligent and &s;lothful, the vigilant and heedle&s;s are equally afflicted. But &s;urely though &s;ome indulgence may be al|lowed to groans extorted by inevitable mi&s;e|ry, no man has a right to repine at evils which, again&s;t warning, again&s;t experience,

he deliberately and lei&s;urely brings upon his own head; or to con&s;ider him&s;elf as debarred from happine&s;s by &s;uch ob&s;tacles as re&s;olution may break, or dexterity may put a&s;ide.</P>
<P>GREAT numbers who quarrel with their condition have wanted not the power but the will to obtain a better &s;tate. They have never contemplated the difference between good and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ufficiently to quicken aver&s;ion or invigorate de&s;ire; they have indulged a drow&s;y thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s or giddy levity; have committed the balance of choice to the ma|nagement of caprice; and when they have long accu&s;tomed them&s;elves to receive all that chance offered them without examination, lament at la&s;t that they find them&s;elves de|ceived.</P>

and an attempt at &s;omething for which nature or education have left him unqua|lified.</P>
<P>IGNORANCE or dulne&s;s have indeed no power of affording delight, but they never give di&s;gu&s;t except when they a&s;&s;ume the dignity of knowledge, or ape the &s;prightli|ne&s;s of wit.

<PB N="50" REF="51">
the appearances that thus powerfully excite his merriment, he will find among them nei|ther poverty nor di&s;ea&s;e, nor any involuntary or painful defect. The di&s;po&s;ition to deri&s;ion and in&s;ult is awakened by the &s;oftne&s;s of fop|pery, the &s;well of in&s;olence, the liveline&s;s of levity, or the &s;olemnity of grandeur; by the &s;prightly trip, the &s;tately &s;talk, the for|mal &s;trut, and the lofty mein; by ge&s;tures intended to catch the eye, and by looks ela+borately formed as evidences of importance.</P>
<P>IT has, I think, been &s;ometimes urged in favour of affectation, that it is only a mi&s;+take of the means to a good end, and that the Intention with which it is practi&s;ed is al+ways to plea&s;e. If all attempts to innovate the con&s;titutional or habitual character have really proceeded from public &s;pirit and from love of others, the world has hitherto been &s;ufficiently ungrateful, &s;ince no return but aver&s;ion and &s;corn has yet been made to the mo&s;t difficult of all enterprizes, a conte&s;t with nature; nor has any pity been &s;hown to the fatigues of labour which never &s;ucceeded, and the unea&s;ine&s;s of di&s;gui&s;e by which nothing was concealed.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="52">
IT &s;eems to be determined by the general &s;uffrage of mankind that he who decks him|&s;elf in ad&s;cititious qualities rather purpo&s;es to command applau&s;e than impart plea&s;ure; and he is therefore treated as a man unrea&s;onably ambitious of di&s;tinction who u&s;urps a place in &s;ociety to which he has no right. Prai&s;e is &s;eldom paid with willingne&s;s even to incon|te&s;table merit, and it can be no wonder that he who calls for it without de&s;ert is repul&s;ed with univer&s;al indignation.</P>
<P>AFFECTATION naturally counterfeits tho&s;e excellencies which are placed at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from po&s;&s;ibility of attain|ment. We are con&s;cious of our own de|fects, and eagerly endeavour to &s;upply them by counterfeited excellence; nor would &s;uch efforts be wholly without excu&s;e, were they not often excited by ornamental trifles, and une&s;&s;ential accompli&s;hments, which he, that thus anxiou&s;ly &s;truggles for the reputation of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them, would not have been thought to want, had not his indu&s;try quickened ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="53">
<HI>GELASIMUS</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t part of his life in academical privacy and rural retire|ment, without any other conver&s;ation than that of &s;cholars grave, &s;tudious, and ab|&s;tracted as him&s;elf. He cultivated the mathe|matical &s;ciences with unde&s;atigable diligence, di&s;covered many u&s;eful theorems, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with great accuracy the re&s;i&s;tance of fluids, and, though his priority was not generally acknowledged, was the fir&s;t who fully ex|plained all the properties of the catenarian curve.</P>
<P>LEARNING, when it ri&s;es to eminence, will be ob&s;erved in time, whatever mi&s;ts may happen to &s;urround it. <HI>Gela&s;imus,</HI> in his forty-ninth year being di&s;tingui&s;hed by tho&s;e who have the rewards of knowledge in their hands, was called out of his ob&s;curity to di&s;+play his acqui&s;itions for the honour of his coun|try, and add dignity by his pre&s;ence to phi+lo&s;ophical a&s;&s;emblies. As he did not &s;u&s;pect his unfitne&s;s for common affairs, he felt no reluctance to obey the invitation, and what he did not feel he had yet too much hone&s;ty to &s;eign. He entered into the world as a larger and more populous college, where
<PB N="53" REF="54">
his performances would be more public, and his renown farther extended; and imagined that he &s;hould find his reputation univer&s;ally prevalent, and the influence of learning every where the &s;ame.</P>
<P>HIS merit introduced him to &s;plendid ta|bles and elegant acquaintance, but he did not find him&s;elf always qualified to join in the conver&s;ation. He was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by civi|lities, which he knew not how to repay, and entangled in many ceremonial perplexi|ties, from which his books and diagrams could not extricate him. He was &s;ometimes unluckily engaged in di&s;putes with ladies, with whom algebraick axioms had no great weight; and &s;aw many who&s;e favour and e&s;teem he could not but de&s;ire, to whom he was very little recommended by his theo|ries of the tides, or his approximations to the quadrature of the circle.</P>
<P><HI>GELASIMUS</HI> did not want penetration to di&s;cover that no charm was more generally irre&s;i&s;tible than that of ea&s;y facetiou&s;ne&s;s and
<PB N="54" REF="55">
flowing hilarity. He &s;aw that diver&s;ion was more frequently welcome than improvement, that authority and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s were rather feared than loved, and that the grave &s;cholar was a kind of imperious ally, ha&s;tily di&s;mi&s;&s;ed when his a&s;&s;i&s;tance was no longer nece&s;&s;ary. He therefore came to a &s;udden re&s;olution of throwing off tho&s;e cumbrous ornaments of learning, which, as he imagined, hindred his reception, and commenced a man of wit and jocularity. Utterly unacquainted with every topic of merriment, ignorant of the modes and follies, the vices and virtues of mankind, and unfurni&s;hed with any ideas but &s;uch as <HI>Pappus</HI> and <HI>Archimedes</HI> had given him, he began to &s;ilence all enquiries with a je&s;t in&s;tead of a &s;olution, extended his face with a grin, which he mi&s;took for a &s;mile, and in the place of a &s;cientifick di&s;cour&s;e, retailed in a new language formed between the college and the tavern, the intelligence of the new&s;|paper.</P>
<P>LAUGHTER, he knew, was a token of alacrity, and, therefore, whatever he &s;aid,
<PB N="55" REF="56">
or heard, he was careful not to fail in that great duty of a wit. If he a&s;ked or told the hour of the day, if he complained of heat or cold, &s;tirred the fire, or filled a gla&s;s, re|moved his chair or &s;nuffed a candle, he al|ways found &s;ome occa&s;ion to laugh. The je&s;t was indeed, generally a &s;ecret to all but him&s;elf, but his habitual confidence in his own di&s;cernment, hindered him from &s;u&s;pect|ing any weakne&s;s or mi&s;take. He wondered that his wit was &s;o little under&s;tood, but ex|pected that his audience would comprehend it by degrees, and per&s;i&s;ted all his life to &s;how by gro&s;s buffoonery, how little the &s;tronge&s;t faculties can perform beyond the li|mits of their own province.</P>

<P>IT is &s;omewhere related by <HI>Le Clerc,</HI> that a wealthy trader of good under&s;tanding, having the common ambition to breed his &s;on a &s;cholar, carried him to an univer&s;ity, re&s;olving to make u&s;e of his own judgment in the choice of a tutor. He had been taught, by whatever intelligence, the neare&s;t way to the heart of an academick, and &s;oon after his arrival opened his pur&s;e with &s;o little re&s;erve, and entertained all who came about him with &s;uch pro&s;u&s;ion of plenty, that the profe&s;&s;ors were lured by the &s;mell of his table from their books, and flocked round him with all the importunity of aukward complai&s;ance. This eagerne&s;s completely an|&s;wered the merchant's purpo&s;e; he glutted them with delicacies, cheared them with wine, and &s;oftened them with care&s;&s;es, till
<PB N="57" REF="58">
by degrees, he prevailed upon one after ano|ther to open his bo&s;om, and make a full di&s;|covery of his competitions, jealou&s;ies, and re&s;entments. After having thus learned each man's character, partly from him&s;elf, and partly from his acquaintances, he at la&s;t re&s;olved to find &s;ome other method of edu|cating his &s;on, and went away fully con|vinced, that a &s;chola&s;tic life has no other tendency than to vitiate the morals, and con|tract the under&s;tanding. Nor could he after|wards hear with patience the prai&s;es of the ancient authors, being per&s;uaded that &s;cho|lars of all ages mu&s;t have been the &s;ame, and that <HI>Xenophon</HI> and <HI>Cicero</HI> were nothing more than profe&s;&s;ors of &s;ome former univer&s;ity, and were therefore mean and &s;elfi&s;h, ignorant and &s;ervile, like tho&s;e whom he had lately vi&s;ited and for&s;aken.</P>
<P>ENVY, curio&s;ity, and our &s;en&s;e of the im|perfection of our pre&s;ent &s;tate, inclines us always to e&s;timate the advantages which are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of others above their real value. Every one mu&s;t have remarked, what powers and prerogatives the vulgar ima|gine to be conferred by learning. A man
<PB N="58" REF="59">
of &s;cience is expected to excel the unlet|tered and unenlightened, even on occa&s;ions where literature is of no u&s;e, and among weak minds, lo&s;es part of his reverence by di&s;covering no &s;uperiority in tho&s;e parts of life, in which all are unavoidably equal; as when a monarch makes a progre&s;s to the re|moter provinces, the ru&s;ticks are &s;aid &s;ome|times to wonder that they find him of the &s;ame &s;ize with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THESE demands of prejudice and folly can never be &s;atisfied, and therefore, many of the imputations which learning &s;uffers from di&s;|appointed ignorance, are without reproach. Yet it cannot be denied, that there are &s;ome failures to which men of &s;tudy are peculiarly expo&s;ed. Every condition has its di&s;advan|tages. The circle of knowledge is too wide for the mo&s;t active and diligent intellect, and while &s;cience is per&s;ued with ardour, other accompli&s;hments of equal u&s;e, are nece&s;&s;arily neglected; as a &s;mall garri&s;on mu&s;t leave one part of an exten&s;ive fortre&s;s naked when an alarm calls them to another.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60">
THE learned, however, might generally &s;upport their dignity with more &s;ucce&s;s, if they &s;uffered not them&s;elves to be mi&s;led by the de|&s;ire of &s;uperfluous attainments, of qualifica|tion which few can under&s;tand or value, and of &s;kill which they may &s;ink into the grave without any con&s;picuous opportunities of ex|erting. <HI>Raphael</HI> in return to <HI>Adam</HI>'s enquiries into the cour&s;es of the &s;tars and the revolutions of heaven, coun&s;els him to withdraw his mind from idle &s;peculations, and in&s;tead of watch|ing motions which he has no power to regu|late, to employ his faculties upon nearer and more intere&s;ting objects, the &s;urvey of his own life, the &s;ubjection of his pa&s;&s;ions, the knowledge of duties which mu&s;t daily be performed, and the detection of dangers which mu&s;t daily be incurred.</P>
<P>THIS angelick coun&s;el every man of letters &s;hould always have before him. He that de|votes him&s;elf wholly to retired &s;tudy, natu|rally &s;inks from omi&s;&s;ion to forgetfulne&s;s of &s;o|cial duties, from which he mu&s;t be &s;ometimes awakened, and recalled to the general condi|tion of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="61">
I AM far from any intention to limit curi|o&s;ity, or con&s;ine the labours of learning to arts of immediate and nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e. It is on|ly from the various e&s;&s;ays of experimental in|du&s;try, and the vague excur&s;ions of minds &s;ent out upon di&s;covery, that any advancement of knowledge can be expected; and though many mu&s;t be di&s;appointed in their labours, yet they are not to be charged with having &s;pent their time in vain; their example contributed to in|&s;pire emulation, and their mi&s;carriages taught others the way to &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT the di&s;tant hope of being one day u&s;e|ful or eminent, ought not to mi&s;lead us too far from that knowledge, which is equally requi|&s;ite to the great and mean, to the celebrated and ob&s;cure; the art of moderating the de&s;ires, of repre&s;&s;ing the appetites, and of conciliating, or retaining the favour of mankind.</P>
<P>NO man can imagine the conduct of his own life unworthy his attention; yet among the &s;ons of learning many may be found who &s;eem to have thought of every thing rather
<PB N="61" REF="62">
than of them&s;elves, and have never conde|&s;cended to ob&s;erve what pa&s;&s;es daily before their eyes: Many who toil through the intri|cacy of complicated &s;y&s;tems, but are in&s;upera|bly embarra&s;&s;ed with the lea&s;t perplexity in common affairs; and while they compare the actions, and a&s;certain the characters of ancient heroes, let their own days glide away without examination, and &s;uffer vicious habits to en|croach upon their minds without re&s;i&s;tance or detection.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t frequent reproaches of the &s;chola&s;tick race is the want of fortitude, of fortitude not martial but philo&s;ophick. Men bred in &s;hades and &s;ilence, taught to im|mure them&s;elves at &s;un&s;et, and accu&s;tomed to no other weapon than &s;yllogi&s;m, may be al|lowed to feel terror at per&s;onal danger, and to be di&s;concerted by tumult and alarm. But why &s;hould he who&s;e life is &s;pent in contempla|tion, and who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is only to di&s;cover truth, be unable to rectify the fallacies of ima|gination, or contend &s;ucce&s;sfully again&s;t preju|dice and pa&s;&s;ion? To what end has he read
<PB N="62" REF="63">
and meditated if he gives up his under&s;tanding to fal&s;e appearances, and &s;uffers him&s;elf at la&s;t, like the meane&s;t of the vulgar, to be en&s;laved by fear of evils to which only folly or vanity can expo&s;e him, or elated by advantages which can add nothing to a wi&s;e man, and to which, as they are equally conferred upon the good and bad, no real dignity is annexed.</P>
<P>SUCH however is the &s;tate of the world, that the mo&s;t ob&s;equious of the &s;laves of pride, the mo&s;t raptuous of the gazers upon wealth, the mo&s;t officious of the whi&s;perers of great|ne&s;s, are collected from &s;eminaries appropri|ated to the &s;tudy of wi&s;dom and the contem|plation of virtue, where it was intended, that appetite &s;hould learn to be content with little, and that hope &s;hould a&s;pire only to honours which no human power can give or take away.</P>
<P>THE &s;tudent, when he comes forth into the world, in&s;tead of congratulating him&s;elf upon his exemption from the errors and failures to which he &s;ees tho&s;e liable who&s;e opinions have
<PB N="63" REF="64">
been formed by accident or cu&s;tom, and who live without any certain principles of conduct, is commonly in ha&s;te to &s;hake from him all that di&s;tingui&s;hes him from the re&s;t of mankind, to mingle on equal terms with the multitude, and &s;hew his &s;prightline&s;s and duc|tility by an expeditious compliance with fa|&s;hions, plea&s;ures, or vices. The fir&s;t &s;mile of a man who&s;e rank or fortune gives him power to reward his dependents commonly enchants him beyond re&s;i&s;tance; the glare of equipage, the &s;weets of luxury, the liberality of general promi&s;es, the &s;oftne&s;s of habitual affability, &s;trike his &s;en&s;es and fill his imagi|nation; and he &s;oon cea&s;es to have any other wi&s;h than to be well received, or any mea|&s;ure of right and wrong but the opinion of his patron.</P>
<P>A MAN flattered and obeyed, &s;oon learns to exact gro&s;&s;er adulation, and enjoin lower &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. Neither our virtues nor vices are all our own. If there were no cowardice, there would be little in&s;olence; a man cannot grow proud to any great degree, but by the con|currence
<PB N="64" REF="65">
of blandi&s;hment or the &s;ufferance of tamene&s;s. The wretch that would &s;hrink and crouch before tho&s;e that &s;hould dart their eyes upon him with the &s;pirit of natural equality, quickly becomes capricious and tyrannical when he &s;ees him&s;elf approached with a down|ca&s;t look, and hears the &s;oft addre&s;s of awe and &s;ervility. To the folly of tho&s;e who are wil|ling to purcha&s;e favour and preferment by cringes and compliance, is to be imputed that general haughtine&s;s of power that leaves no|thing to be hoped by firmne&s;s and integrity.</P>
<P>IF in&s;tead of wandering after the meteors of philo&s;ophy which fill the world with &s;plen|dor for a while, and then &s;ink and are forgot|ten, the candidates of learning would fix their eyes only upon the permanent and immutable lu&s;tre of moral and religious truth, they would find a more certain direction to honour and hap|pine&s;s. A little plau&s;ibility of di&s;cour&s;e, and a little acquaintance with unnece&s;&s;ary &s;pecula|tions, is dearly purcha&s;ed when it excludes tho&s;e in&s;tructions which fortify the heart with re&s;olu|tion and exalt the &s;pirit to independence.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have pa&s;&s;ed much of my life in di&s;quiet and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and lo&s;t many op|portunities of advantage by a pa&s;&s;ion which I have rea&s;on to believe prevalent in different degrees over a great part of mankind, I can|not but think my&s;elf well qualified to warn tho&s;e who are yet uncaptivated, of the danger which they incur by placing them&s;elves within its influence.</P>
<P>I SERVED an apprentice&s;hip to a linen-dra|per with uncommon reputation for diligence and fidelity; and at the age of three and twen|ty opened a &s;hop for my&s;elf with a large &s;tock, and &s;uch credit among all the merchants who were acquainted with my ma&s;ter that I could command whatever was imported curious or
<PB N="66" REF="67">
valuable. For five years I proceeded with &s;uc|ce&s;s proportionate to clo&s;e application and un|tainted integrity; was a daring bidder at every &s;ale; always paid my notes before they were due; and advanced &s;o fa&s;t in commercial re|putation, that I was proverbially marked out as the model of young traders, and every one expected that a few years would make me an alderman.</P>
<P>IN this cour&s;e of even pro&s;perity, I was one day per&s;uaded to buy a ticket in the lottery. The &s;um was incon&s;iderable, the greater part was to be repaid though fortuen might fail to favour me, and therefore my e&s;tabli&s;hed max|ims of frugality did not re&s;train me from &s;o trifling an experiment. The ticket lay almo&s;t forgotten till the time at which every man's fate was to be determined; nor did the affair even then &s;eem of any importance, till I di&s;|covered by the publick papers that the num|ber next to mine had conferred the great prize.</P>
<P>MY heart leaped at the thought of &s;uch an approach to &s;udden riches, which I con&s;idered
<PB N="67" REF="68">
my&s;elf, however contrarily to the laws of computation, as having mi&s;&s;ed by a &s;ingle chance; and I could not forbear to revolve the con&s;equences which &s;uch a bounteous allot|ment would have produced, if it had hap|pened to me. This dream of felicity, by de|grees took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my imagination. The great delight of my &s;olitary hours was to pur|cha&s;e an e&s;tate, and form plantations with money which once might have been mine, and I never met my friends but I &s;poiled all their merriment by perpetual complaints of my ill luck.</P>
<P>AT length another lottery was opened, and I had now &s;o heated my imagination with the pro&s;pect of a prize, that I &s;hould have pre&s;&s;ed among the fir&s;t purcha&s;ers, had not my ardour been with-held by deliberation upon the pro|bability of &s;ucce&s;s from one ticket rather than another. I he&s;itated long between even and odd; con&s;idered the &s;quare and cubick num|bers through the lottery; examined all tho&s;e to which good luck had been hitherto annex|ed; and at la&s;t fixed upon one which by &s;ome
<PB N="68" REF="69">
&s;ecret relation to the events of my life I thought prede&s;tined to make me happy. De|lay in great affairs is often mi&s;chievous; the ticket was &s;old, and its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or could not be found.</P>
<P>IRETURNED to my conjectures, and af|ter many arts of progno&s;tication, fixed upon another chance, but with le&s;s confidence. Ne|ver did captive, heir, or lover feel &s;o much vexation from the &s;low pace of time, as I &s;uf|fered between the purcha&s;e of my ticket and the di&s;tribution of the prizes. I &s;olaced my unea&s;ine&s;s as I could, by frequent contem|plations of approaching happine&s;s; when the &s;un ro&s;e I knew it would &s;et, and congra|tulated my&s;elf at night that I was &s;o much nearer to my wi&s;hes. At la&s;t the day came, my ticket appeared, and rewarded all my care and &s;agacity with a de&s;picable prize of fifty pounds.</P>
<P>MY friends, who hone&s;tly rejoiced upon my &s;ucce&s;s were very coldly received; I hid my&s;elf a fortnight in the country, that my chagrine might fume away without ob&s;erva|tion,
<PB N="69" REF="70">
and then returning to my &s;hop began to li&s;ten after another lottery.</P>
<P>WITH the news of a lottery I was &s;oon gratified, and having now found the vanity of conjecture and inefficacy of computation, I re&s;olved to take the prize by violence, and therefore bought forty tickets, not omitting however to divide them between the even and odd numbers that I might not mi&s;s the lucky cla&s;s. Many conclu&s;ions did I form, and ma|ny experiments did I try to determine from which of tho&s;e tickets I might mo&s;t rea&s;ona|bly expect riches. At la&s;t, being unable to &s;atisfy my&s;elf by any modes of rea&s;oning, I wrote the numbers upon dice, and allotted five hours every day to the amu&s;ement of throwing them in a garret, and, examining the event by an exact regi&s;ter, found, on the evening before the lottery was drawn, that one of my numbers had been turned up five times more than any of the re&s;t in three hun|dred and thirty thou&s;and throws.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">
THIS experiment was fallacious; the fir&s;t day pre&s;ented the hopeful ticket, a dete&s;table blank. The re&s;t came out with different for|tune, and in conclu&s;ion I lo&s;t thirty pounds by this great adventure.</P>
<P>I HAD now wholly changed the ca&s;t of my behaviour and the conduct of my life. The &s;hop was for the mo&s;t part abandoned to my &s;ervants, and, if I entered it, my thoughts were &s;o engro&s;&s;ed by my tickets, that I &s;carce|ly heard or an&s;wered a que&s;tion, but con&s;ider|ed every cu&s;tomer as an intruder upon my meditations whom I was in ha&s;te to di&s;patch. I mi&s;took the price of my goods, committed blunders in my bills, forgot to file my receipts, and neglected to regulate my books. My ac|quaintances by degrees began to fall away, but I perceived the decline of my bu&s;ine&s;s with little emotion, becau&s;e whatever deficiency there might be in my gains I expected the next lottery to &s;upply.</P>
<P>MISCARRIAGE naturally produces diffi|dence; I began now to &s;eek a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t
<PB N="71" REF="72">
ill luck, by an alliance with tho&s;e that had been more &s;ucce&s;sful. I enquired diligently, at what office any prize had been &s;old, that I might purcha&s;e of a propitious vender; &s;oli|cited tho&s;e who had been fortunate in former lotteries, to partake with me in my new tickets; and, whenever I met with one that had in any event of his life been eminently pro&s;perous, I invited him to take a larger &s;hare. I had, by this rule of conduct, &s;o dif|fu&s;ed my intere&s;t, that I had a fourth part of fifteen tickets, an eighth of forty, and a &s;ix|teenth of ninety.</P>
<P>I WAITED for the deci&s;ion of my fate with my former palpitations, and looked upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of my trade with the u&s;ual neg|lect. The wheel at la&s;t was turned, and its revolutions brought me a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;orrows and di&s;appointments. I indeed often partook of a &s;mall prize, and the lo&s;s of one day was generally balanced by the gain of the next; but my de&s;ires yet remained un&s;atisfied, and when one of my chances had failed, all my expectation was &s;u&s;pended on tho&s;e which
<PB N="72" REF="73">
remained yet undetermined. At la&s;t a prize of five thou&s;and pounds was proclaimed; I caught fire at the cry, and enquiring the num|ber found it to be one of my own tickets, which I had divided among tho&s;e on who&s;e luck I depended, and of which I had retained only a &s;ixteenth part.</P>
<P>YOU will ea&s;ily judge, with what dete&s;ta|tion of him&s;elf, a man thus intent upon gain reflected that he had &s;old a prize which was once in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It was to no purpo&s;e, that I repre&s;ented to my mind, the impo&s;&s;ibi|bility of recalling the pa&s;t, or the folly of condemning an act, which only its event, an event which no human intelligence could fore|&s;ee, proved to be wrong. The prize which though put in my hands had been &s;uffered to &s;lip from me filled me with angui&s;h; and knowing that complaint would only expo&s;e me to ridicule, I gave my&s;elf up &s;ilently to grief, and lo&s;t by degrees my appetite and my re&s;t.</P>
<P>MY indi&s;po&s;ition &s;oon became vi&s;ible; I was vi&s;ited by my friends, and among them
<PB N="73" REF="74">
by <HI>Eumathes</HI> a clergyman who&s;e piety and learning gave him &s;uch an a&s;cendant over me, that I could not refu&s;e to open my heart. There are, &s;aid he, few minds &s;ufficiently firm to be tru&s;ted in the hands of chance. Whoever finds him&s;elf inclined to anticipate futurity, and exalt po&s;&s;ibility to certainty, &s;hould avoid every kind of ca&s;ual adventure, &s;ince his grief mu&s;t be always proportionate to his hope. You have long wa&s;ted that time, which by a proper application, would have certainly though moderately encrea&s;ed your fortune, in a laborious and anxious per&s;uit of a &s;pecies of gain, which no labour or anxiety, no art or expedient can &s;ecure or promote. You are now fretting away your life in re|pentance of an act, again&s;t which repentance can give no caution, but to avoid the occa&s;ion of committing it. Rou&s;e from this lazy dream of fortuitous riches, which, if obtained you could &s;carcely have enjoyed, becau&s;e they could confer no con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of de&s;ert; re|turn to rational and manly indu&s;try, and con|&s;ider the meer gift of luck as below the care of a wi&s;e man.</P>

<P>IT has been ob&s;erved in a late paper, that we are unrea&s;onably de&s;irous to &s;eparate the goods of life from tho&s;e evils which pro|vidence has connected with them, and to catch advantages without paying the price at which they are offered us. Every man wi&s;hes to be rich, but very few have the powers ne|ce&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e a &s;udden fortune, by new di&s;coveries, or &s;uperiority of &s;kill in any nece&s;&s;ary employment; and among low|er under&s;tandings many want the firmne&s;s and indu&s;try requi&s;ite to regular gain and gra|dual acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>FROM the hope of enjoying affluence by methods more compendious than tho&s;e of la|bour, and more generally practicable than tho&s;e of genius, proceeds the common incli|nation to experiment and hazard, and that willingne&s;s to &s;natch all opportunities of
<PB N="75" REF="76">
growing rich by chance, which, when it has once taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind, is &s;eldom driven out either by time or argument, but continues to wa&s;te life in perpetual delu&s;ion, and generally ends in wretchedne&s;s and want.</P>
<P>THE folly of untimely exultation and vi|&s;ionary pro&s;perity, is by no means peculiar to the purcha&s;ers of tickets; there are multitudes who&s;e life is nothing but a continual lottery; who are always within a few months of plen|ty and happine&s;s, and how often &s;oever they are mocked with blanks, expect a prize from the next adventure.</P>
<P>AMONG the mo&s;t re&s;olute and ardent of the votaries of chance, may be numbered the mortals who&s;e hope is to rai&s;e them|&s;elves by a wealthy match; who lay out all their indu&s;try on the a&s;&s;iduities of court&s;hip, and &s;leep and wake with no other ideas than of treats, compliments, guardians, and rivals.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t indefatigable of this cla&s;s, is my old friend <HI>Leviculus,</HI> whom I have never known for thirty years without &s;ome matrimonial project of advantage. <HI>Leviculus</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="77">
was bred under a merchant, and by the graces of his per&s;on, the &s;prightline&s;s of his prattle, and the neatne&s;s of his dre&s;s, &s;o much ena|moured his ma&s;ter's &s;econd daughter, a girl of &s;ixteen, that &s;he declared her re&s;olution to have no other hu&s;band. Her father, after having chidden her for undutifulne&s;s, con&s;ent|ed to the match, not much to the &s;atisfaction of <HI>Leviculus,</HI> who was &s;ufficiently elated with his conque&s;t to think him&s;elf entitled to a larger fortune. He was, however, &s;oon rid of his perplexity, for his mi&s;tre&s;s died before their marriage.</P>
<P><HI>LEVICULUS</HI> was &s;o well &s;atisfied with his own accompli&s;hments, that he determined to commence fortune-hunter, and when his apprentice&s;hip expired, in&s;tead of beginning, as was expected, to walk the exchange with a face of importance, or a&s;&s;ociating him&s;elf with tho&s;e who were mo&s;t eminent for their knowledge of the &s;tocks, he at once threw off the &s;olemnity of the counting-hou&s;e, equipped him&s;elf with a modi&s;h wig, li&s;tned to wits in coffee hou&s;es, pa&s;&s;ed his evenings behind the &s;cenes in the theatres, learned the names of beauties of quality, hummed the
<PB N="77" REF="78">
la&s;t &s;tanzas of fa&s;hionable &s;ongs, talked with familiarity of high play, boa&s;ted of his at|chievements upon drawers and coachmen, was often brought to his lodgings at mid|night in a chair, told with negligence and jo|cularity of bilking a taylor, and now and then let fly a &s;hrewd je&s;t at a &s;ober citizen.</P>
<P>THUS furni&s;hed with irre&s;i&s;tible artillery, he turned his batteries upon the female world, and in the fir&s;t warmth of &s;elf-approbation propo&s;ed no le&s;s than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of riches and beauty united. He therefore paid his ci|vilities to <HI>Flavilla,</HI> the only daughter of a wealthy merchant, who not being accu&s;tomed to amorous blandi&s;hments, or re&s;pectful ad|dre&s;&s;es, was delighted with the novelty of love, and ea&s;ily &s;uffered him to conduct her to the play, and to meet her where &s;he vi|&s;ited. <HI>Leviculus</HI> did not doubt but her father, however offended by a clande&s;tine marriage, would &s;oon be reconciled by the tears of his daughter, and the merit of his &s;on-in|law, and was in ha&s;te to conclude the af|fair. But the lady liked better to be courted than married, and kept him three years in
<PB N="78" REF="79">
uncertainty and attendance. At la&s;t &s;he fell in love with a young en&s;ign at a ball, and having danced with him all night, married him in the morning.</P>
<P><HI>LEVICULUS,</HI> to avoid the ridicule of his companions, took a journey to a &s;mall e&s;tate in the country, where, after his u&s;ual enquiries concerning the nymphs in the neigh|bourhood, he found it proper to fall in love with <HI>Altilia,</HI> a maiden lady, twenty years older than him&s;elf, for who&s;e favour fifteen nephews and nieces were in perpetual conten|tion. They hovered round her with &s;uch jea|lous officiou&s;ne&s;s, as &s;carcely left a moment vacant for a lover. <HI>Leviculus,</HI> neverthele&s;s, di&s;|covered his pa&s;&s;ion in a letter, and <HI>Altilia</HI> could not with&s;tand the plea&s;ure of hearing vows and &s;ighs, and flatteries, and prote|&s;tations. She admitted his vi&s;its, enjoy|ed, for five years, the happine&s;s of keep|ing all her expectants in perpetual alarms, and amu&s;ed her&s;elf with the various &s;trata|gems which were practi&s;ed to di&s;engage her affections. Sometimes &s;he was advi&s;ed with great earne&s;tne&s;s to travel for her health, and &s;ometimes entreated to keep her brother's
<PB N="79" REF="80">
hou&s;e. Many &s;tories were &s;pread to the di&s;|advantage of <HI>Leviculus,</HI> by which &s;he com|monly &s;eemed affected for a time, but took care &s;oon afterwards to expre&s;s her conviction of their fal&s;hood. But being at la&s;t &s;atiated with this ludicrous tyranny, &s;he told her lover when he pre&s;&s;ed for the reward of his &s;er|vices, that &s;he was very &s;en&s;ible of his merit, but was re&s;olved not to impoveri&s;h an ancient family.</P>
<P><HI>LEVICULUS</HI> then returned to the town, and &s;oon after his arrival became ac|quainted with <HI>Latronia,</HI> a lady di&s;tingui&s;hed by the elegance of her equipage, and the re|gularity of her conduct. Her wealth was evi|dent in her magnificence, and her prudence in her oeconomy, and therefore <HI>Leviculus</HI> who had &s;carcely confidence to &s;olicit her fa|vour, readily acquitted fortune of her former debts, when he found him&s;elf di&s;tingui&s;hed by her with &s;uch marks of preference as a wo|man of mode&s;ty is allowed to give. He now grew bolder, and ventured to breathe out his impatience before her. She heard him with|out re&s;entment, in time permitted him to hope for happine&s;s, and at la&s;t fixed the nup|tial
<PB N="80" REF="81">
day without any di&s;tru&s;tful re&s;erve of pin|money, or &s;ordid &s;tipulations for jointure, and &s;ettlements.</P>
<P><HI>LEVICULUS</HI> was triumphing on the eve of marriage, when he heard on the &s;tairs the voice of <HI>Latronia</HI>'s maid, whom frequent bribes had &s;ecured in his &s;ervice. She &s;oon bur&s;t into his room, and told him, that &s;he could not &s;uffer him to be longer deceived; that her mi&s;tre&s;s was now &s;pending the la&s;t payment of her fortune, and was only &s;up|ported in her expence by the credit of his e&s;tate. <HI>Leviculus</HI> &s;huddered to &s;ee him&s;elf &s;o near a precipice, and found that he was in|debted for his e&s;cape to the re&s;entment of the maid, who having a&s;&s;i&s;ted <HI>Latronia</HI> to gain the conque&s;t, quarrelled with her at la&s;t about the plunder.</P>
<P><HI>LEVICULUS</HI> was now hopele&s;s and di&s;|con&s;olate, till one &s;unday he &s;aw a lady in the mall, whom her dre&s;s declared a widow, and whom, by the jolting prance of her gait, and the broad re&s;plendence of her counte|nance, he gue&s;&s;ed to have lately buried &s;ome pro&s;perous citizen. He followed her home,
<PB N="81" REF="82">
and found her to be no le&s;s than the relict of <HI>Prune,</HI> the grocer, who, having no children, had bequeathed to her all his debts and dues, and his e&s;tates real and per&s;onal. No forma|lity was nece&s;&s;ary in addre&s;&s;ing madam <HI>Prune,</HI> and therefore <HI>Leviculus</HI> went next morning without an introductor. His declaration was received with a loud laugh; &s;he then collected her countenance, wondered at his impudence, a&s;ked if he knew to whom he was talking, then &s;howed him the door, and again laughed to find him confu&s;ed. <HI>Leviculus</HI> di&s;covered that this coar&s;ene&s;s was nothing more than the coquetry of <HI>Cornhill,</HI> and next day re|turned to the attack. He &s;oon grew familiar to her dialect, and in a few weeks heard with|out any emotion, hints of gay cloaths with empty pockets; concurred in many &s;age re|marks on the regard due to people of pro|perty; and agreed with her in dete&s;tation of the ladies at the other end of the town, who pinched their bellies to buy fine laces, and then pretended to laugh at the city.</P>
<P>HE &s;ometimes pre&s;umed to mention mar|riage; but was always an&s;wered with a &s;lap, a hoot, and a &s;lounce. At la&s;t he began to
<PB N="82" REF="83">
pre&s;s her clo&s;er, and thought him&s;elf more favourably received; but going one morning, with a re&s;olution to trifle no longer, he found her gone to church with a young journey-man from the neighbouring &s;hop, of whom &s;he had become enamoured at her window.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e, and a thou&s;and intermediate ad|ventures, has <HI>Leviculus</HI> &s;pent his time, till he is now grown grey with age, fatigue, and di&s;appointment. He begins at la&s;t to find, that &s;ucce&s;s is not to be expected, and being unfit for any employment that might improve his fortune, and unfurni&s;hed with any arts that might amu&s;e his lei&s;ure, is condemned to wear out a ta&s;tele&s;s life in narratives which few will hear, and complaints which none will pity.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE ho&s;tility perpetually exerci&s;ed be|tween one man and another is cau&s;|ed by the de&s;ire of many for that which only few can po&s;&s;e&s;s. Every man would be rich, powerful, and famous; yet &s;ame, power, and riches, are only the names of relative con|ditions, which imply the ob&s;curity, depend|ance, and poverty of greater numbers.</P>
<P>THIS univer&s;al and ince&s;&s;ant competition, produces injury and malice by two motives, intere&s;t, and envy; the pro&s;pect of adding to our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions what we can take from others, and the hope of alleviating the &s;en&s;e of our di&s;parity by le&s;&s;ening others, though we gain nothing to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>OF the&s;e two malignant and de&s;tructive powers, it &s;eems probable at the fir&s;t view, that intere&s;t has the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive
<PB N="84" REF="85">
influence. It is ea&s;y to conceive that opportunities to &s;eize what has been long wanted, may excite de&s;ires almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible; but &s;urely, the &s;ame eagerne&s;s cannot be kind|led by an accidental power of de&s;troying that which gives happine&s;s to another. It mu&s;t be more natural to rob for gain, than to ravage only for mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>YET I am inclined to believe, that the great law of mutual benevolence is oftener violated by envy than by intere&s;t, and that mo&s;t of the mi&s;ery which the defamation of blame|le&s;s actions, or the ob&s;truction of hone&s;t en|deavours brings upon the world, is inflicted by men that propo&s;e no advantage to them|&s;elves but the &s;atisfaction of poi&s;oning the banquet which they cannot ta&s;te, and bla&s;t|ing the harve&s;t which they have no right to reap.</P>
<P>INTEREST can diffu&s;e it&s;elf but to a nar|row compa&s;s. The number is never large of tho&s;e who can hope to fill the po&s;ts of de|graded power, catch the fragments of &s;hat|tered fortune, or &s;ucceed to the honours of depreciated beauty. But the empire of envy,
<PB N="85" REF="86">
has no limits, as it requires to its influence very little help from external circum&s;tances. Envy may always be produced by idlene&s;s and pride, and in what place will not they be found?</P>
<P>INTEREST requires &s;ome qualities not univer&s;ally be&s;towed. The ruin of another will produce no profit to him, who has not di&s;cernment to mark his advantage, cou|rage to &s;eize, and activity to pur&s;ue it; but the cold malignity of envy may be exerted in a torpid and quie&s;cent &s;tate, amid&s;t the gloom of &s;tupidity, in the coverts of cowardice. He that falls by the attacks of intere&s;t, is torn by hungry tigers; he may di&s;cover and re&s;i&s;t his enemies. He that peri&s;hes in the ambu&s;hes of envy, is de&s;troyed by unknown and invi|&s;ible a&s;&s;ailants, and dies like him who is &s;uf|focated by a poi&s;onous vapour, without know|ledge of his danger, or po&s;&s;ibility of conte&s;t.</P>
<P>INTEREST is &s;eldom pur&s;ued but at &s;ome hazard. He that hopes to gain much, has commonly &s;omething to lo&s;e, and when he ventures to attack &s;uperiority, if he fails to conquer, is irrecoverably cru&s;hed. But envy
<PB N="86" REF="87">
may act without expence, or danger. To &s;pread &s;u&s;picion, to invent calumnies, to pro|pagate &s;candal, requires neither labour nor courage. It is ea&s;y for the author of a lye however malignant to e&s;cape detection, and infamy needs very little indu&s;try to a&s;&s;i&s;t its circulation.</P>
<P>ENVY is almo&s;t the only vice which is practicable at all times, and in every place, the only pa&s;&s;ion which can never lie quiet for want of irritation; its effects therefore are every where di&s;coverable, and its attempts al|ways to be dreaded.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to mention a name which any advantageous di&s;tinction has made emi|nent, but &s;ome latent animo&s;ity will bur&s;t out. The wealthy trader, however he may ab&s;tract him&s;elf from publick affairs, will never want tho&s;e who hint with <HI>Shylock,</HI> that &s;hips are but boards, and that no man can properly be termed rich who&s;e fortune is at the mercy of the winds. The beauty, adorned only with the unambitious graces of innocence and mo|de&s;ty, provokes, whenever &s;he appears, a thou&s;and murmurs of detraction and whi&s;pers
<PB N="87" REF="88">
of &s;u&s;picion. The genius, even when he endeavours only to entertain with plea&s;ing images of nature, or in&s;truct by unconte&s;ted principles of &s;cience, yet &s;uffers per&s;ecution from innumerable criticks, who&s;e acrimony is excited merely by the pain of &s;eeing others plea&s;ed, and of hearing applau&s;es which an|other enjoys.</P>
<P>THE frequency of envy makes it &s;o fami|liar, that it e&s;capes our notice; nor do we often reflect upon its turpitude or malignity, till we happen to feel its influence. When he that has given no provocation to malice, but by attempting to excel in &s;ome u&s;eful art, finds him&s;elf pur&s;ued by multitudes whom he never &s;aw with all the implacability of per|&s;onal re&s;entment; when he perceives clamour and malice let loo&s;e upon him as a publick enemy, and incited by every &s;tratagem of de|famation; when he hears the misfortunes of his family, or the follies of his youth expo&s;ed to the world; and every failure of conduct, or de&s;ect of nature aggravated and ridiculed; he then learns to abhor tho&s;e artifices, at which he only laughed before, and di&s;covers how much the happine&s;s of life would be ad|vanced
<PB N="88" REF="89">
by the eradication of envy from the human heart.</P>
<P>ENVY is, indeed, a &s;tubborn weed of the mind, and &s;eldom yields to the culture of philo&s;ophy. There are, however, con&s;ide|rations, which if carefully implanted and di|ligently propagated, might in time over power and repre&s;s it, &s;ince no one can nur&s;e it for the &s;ake of plea&s;ure, as its effects are only &s;hame, angui&s;h, and perturbation.</P>
<P>IT is above all other vices incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of a &s;ocial being, becau&s;e it &s;a|crifices truth and kindne&s;s to very weak temp|tations. He that plunders a wealthy neigh|bour, gains as much as he takes away, and improves his own condition in the &s;ame pro|portion as he impairs another's; but he that bla&s;ts a flouri&s;hing reputation, mu&s;t be con|tent with a &s;mall dividend of additional fame, &s;o &s;mall as can afford very little con&s;olation to balance the guilt by which it is obtained.</P>
<P>I HAVE hitherto avoided that dangerous and empirical morality, which cures one vice by means of another. But envy is &s;o ba&s;e
<PB N="89" REF="90">
and dete&s;table, &s;o vile in its original, and &s;o pernicious in its effects, that the predomi|nance of almo&s;t any other quality is to be de&s;ired. It is one of tho&s;e lawle&s;s enemies of &s;ociety, again&s;t which poi&s;oned arrows may hone&s;tly be u&s;ed. Let it, therefore, be con&s;tantly remembered, that whoever envies another, confe&s;&s;es his &s;uperiority, and let tho&s;e be reformed by their pride who have lo&s;t their virtue.</P>
<P>IT is no &s;light aggravation of the injuries which envy incites, that they are committed again&s;t tho&s;e, who have given no intentional provocation; and that the &s;ufferer is marked out for ruin, not becau&s;e he has failed in any duty, but becau&s;e he has dared to do more than was required.</P>
<P>ALMOST every other crime is practi&s;ed by the help of &s;ome quality which might have produced e&s;teem or love, if it had been well employed; but envy is mere unmixed and genuine evil; it pur&s;ues a hateful end by de&s;picable means, and de&s;ires not &s;o much its own happine&s;s as another's mi&s;ery. To avoid depravity like this, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that any

one &s;hould a&s;pire to heroi&s;m or &s;anctity, but only, that he &s;hould re&s;olve not to quit the rank which nature a&s;&s;igns him, and wi&s;h to maintain the dignity of a human being.</P>

<P>AS every &s;cheme of life, &s;o every form of writing has its advantages and in|conveniencies, though not mingled in the &s;ame proportions. The writer of e&s;&s;ays, e&s;capes many embarra&s;&s;ments to which a large work would have expo&s;ed him; he &s;el|dom harra&s;&s;es his rea&s;on with long trains of con&s;equence, dims his eyes with the peru&s;al of antiquated volumes, or burthens his me|mory with great accumulations of prepara|tory knowledge. A carele&s;s glance upon a favourite author, or tran&s;ient &s;urvey of the varieties of life, is generally &s;ufficient to &s;up|ply
<PB N="91" REF="92">
the fir&s;t hint or &s;eminal idea, which en|larged by the gradual accretion of matter &s;tored in the mind, is by the warmth of fancy ea&s;ily expanded into flowers, and &s;ometimes ripened into fruit.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t frequent difficulty, by which the authors of the&s;e petty compo&s;itions are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, ari&s;es from the perpetual demand of novelty and change. The compiler of a &s;y&s;tem of &s;cience lays his invention at re&s;t, and employs only his judgment, the faculty exerted with lea&s;t fatigue. Even the relator of feigned adventures, when once the prin|cipal characters are e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the great events regularly connected, finds incidents and epi&s;odes crouding upon his mind; every change opens new views, and the latter part of the &s;tory grows without labour out of the former. But he that attempts to entertain his reader with unconnected pieces, finds the irk&s;omene&s;s of his ta&s;k rather encrea&s;ed than le&s;&s;ened by every production. The day calls a fre&s;h upon him for a new topick, and he is again obliged to choo&s;e without any principle to regulate his choice.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93">
IT is indeed true, that there is &s;eldom any nece&s;&s;ity of looking far, or enquiring long for a proper &s;ubject. Every diver&s;ity of art or nature, every public ble&s;&s;ing or calamity, eve|ry dome&s;tick pain or gratification, every &s;ally of caprice, blunder of ab&s;urdity, or &s;tratagem of affectation may &s;upply matter to him who&s;e only rule is to avoid uniformity. But it of|ten happens that plenty is the cau&s;e of pe|nury; the judgment is di&s;tracted with bound|le&s;s multiplicity, the imagination ranges from one de&s;ign to another, and the hours pa&s;s im|perceptibly away till the compo&s;ition can be no longer delayed, and nece&s;&s;ity enforces the u&s;e of tho&s;e thoughts which then happen to be at hand. The mind rejoicing at delive|rance on any terms from perplexity and &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, applies her&s;elf vigorou&s;ly to the work before her, collects embelli&s;hments and illu|&s;trations, and &s;ometimes fini&s;hes with great elegance and happine&s;s what in a &s;tate of ea&s;e and lei&s;ure &s;he never had begun.</P>
<P>IT is not commonly ob&s;erved, how much, even of actions con&s;idered as particularly &s;ub|ject to choice is to be attributed to accident, or &s;ome cau&s;e out of our own power, by
<PB N="93" REF="94">
whatever name it be di&s;tingui&s;hed. To clo&s;e tedious deliberations with ha&s;ty re&s;olves, and af|ter long con&s;ultations with rea&s;on to refer the que&s;tion to caprice, is by no means peculiar to the e&s;&s;ayi&s;t. Let him that peru&s;es this paper, review the &s;eries of his life, and enquire how he was placed in his pre&s;ent condition. He will find that of the good or ill which he has experienced, a great part came unexpected, without any vi&s;ible gradations of approach; that every event has been influenced by cau&s;es acting without his intervention or concur|rence; and that whenever he pretended to the prerogative of fore&s;ight, he was mortified with new conviction of the &s;hortne&s;s of his views.</P>
<P>THE bu&s;y, the ambitious, the incon&s;tant, and the adventurous, may be &s;aid to throw them&s;elves by de&s;ign into the arms of fortune, and voluntarily to quit the power of governing them&s;elves; they engage in a cour&s;e of life in which little can be a&s;certained by pre|vious mea&s;ures; the mo&s;t enlightened wi&s;|dom mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with &s;uch ob&s;cure conjectures, as the compari&s;on of probabi|lities will afford; nor is it any wonder that
<PB N="94" REF="95">
their time is pa&s;t between elation and de&s;pon|dency, hope and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>SOME there are who appear to walk the road of life with more circum&s;pection, and make no &s;tep till they think them&s;elves &s;ecure from the hazard of a precipice; when neither plea&s;ure nor profit can tempt them from the beaten path; who refu&s;e to climb le&s;t they &s;hould fall, or to run le&s;t they &s;hould &s;tumble, and move &s;lowly forward without any compliance with tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions by which the heady and vehe|ment are &s;educed and betrayed.</P>
<P>YET even the timorous prudence of this judicious cla&s;s is far from exempting them from the dominion of chance, a &s;ubtle and in&s;idious power, who will intrude upon pri|vacy and embarra&s;s caution. No cour&s;e of life is &s;o pre&s;cribed and limited, but that many actions mu&s;t re&s;ult from arbitrary elec|tion. Every one mu&s;t form the general plan of his conduct by his own reflections; he mu&s;t re&s;olve whether he will endeavour at riches or at content; whether he will exerci&s;e private or publick virtues; whether he will labour for the general benefit of mankind,
<PB N="95" REF="96">
or contract his beneficence to his family and dependents.</P>
<P>THIS is a que&s;tion which has long exer|ci&s;ed the &s;chools of philo&s;ophy, but remains yet undecided; and what hope is there that a young man, unacquainted with the argu|ments on either &s;ide, &s;hould determine his own de&s;tiny otherwi&s;e than by chance.</P>
<P>WHEN chance has given him a partner of his bed, whom he prefers to all other wo|men without any proof of &s;uperior de&s;ert, chance mu&s;t again direct him in the edu|cation of his children; for who was ever able to convince him&s;elf by arguments, that he had cho&s;en for his &s;on that mode of in|&s;truction to which his under&s;tanding was be&s;t adapted, or by which he would mo&s;t ea&s;ily be made wi&s;e or virtuous?</P>
<P>WHOEVER &s;hall enquire by what motives he was determined on the&s;e important occa|&s;ions, will find them &s;uch, as his pride will &s;carcely &s;uffer him to confe&s;s; &s;ome &s;udden ardour of de&s;ire, &s;ome uncertain glimp&s;e of
<PB N="96" REF="97">
advantage, &s;ome trivial competition, &s;ome inaccurate conclu&s;ion, or &s;ome example im|plicitly reverenced. Such are often the fir&s;t cau&s;es of our re&s;olves; for it is nece&s;&s;ary to act, but impo&s;&s;ible to know the con&s;equences of action, or to di&s;cu&s;s all the rea&s;ons which offer them&s;elves on every part to inqui&s;itive|ne&s;s and &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>SINCE life it&s;elf is uncertain, nothing which has life for its ba&s;is, can boa&s;t much &s;tability. Yet this is but a &s;mall part of our perplexity. We &s;et out on a tempe|&s;tuous &s;ea, in que&s;t of &s;ome port, where we expect to find re&s;t, but where we are not &s;ure of admi&s;&s;ion; we are not only in danger of &s;inking in the way, but of being mi&s;led by meteors mi&s;taken for &s;tars, of being driven from our cour&s;e by the changes of the wind, and of lo&s;ing it by un&s;kilful &s;teerage; yet it &s;ometimes happens, that cro&s;s winds blow us to a &s;afer coa&s;t, that meteors draw us a&s;ide from whirlpools, and that negligence or error contributes to our e&s;cape from mi&s;chiefs to which a direct cour&s;e would have expo&s;ed us. Of tho&s;e that by precipitate conclu&s;ions, involve them&s;elves in calamities, without
<PB N="97" REF="98">
guilt, very few however they may reproach them&s;elves, can be certain that other mea|&s;ures would have been more &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>IN this &s;tate of univer&s;al uncertainty, where a thou&s;and dangers hover about us, and none can tell whether the good that he pur&s;ues is not evil in di&s;gui&s;e, or whether the next &s;tep will lead him to &s;afety or de|&s;truction, nothing can afford any rational tranquility, but the conviction, that, how|ever we amu&s;e our&s;elves with unideal &s;ounds, nothing in reality is governed by chance, but that the univer&s;e is under the perpetual &s;u|perintendence of him who created it; that our being is in the hands of omnipotent goodne&s;s, by whom what appears ca&s;ual to us is directed for ends ultimately kind and merciful; and that nothing can finally hurt him who debars not him&s;elf from the divine favour.</P>

<P>NO vitious di&s;po&s;itions of the mind more ob&s;tinately re&s;i&s;t both the coun|&s;els of philo&s;ophy and the injunctions of religion, than tho&s;e which are complicated with an opinion of dignity; and which we cannot di&s;mi&s;s without leaving in the hands of oppo&s;ition &s;ome advantage iniquitou&s;ly ob|tained, or &s;uffering from our own prejudices &s;ome imputation of pu&s;illanimity.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on &s;carcely any law of our re|deemer is more openly tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, or more in|du&s;triou&s;ly evaded, than that by which he com|mands his followers to forgive injuries, and
<PB N="99" REF="100">
prohibits under the &s;anction of eternal mi|&s;ery, the gratification of the de&s;ire which every man feels to return pain upon him that inflicts it. Many who could have conquered their anger, are unable to com|bat again&s;t pride, and pur&s;ue offences to ex|tremity of vengeance, le&s;t they &s;hould be in&s;ulted by the triumph of an enemy.</P>
<P>BUT certainly no precept could better be|come him, at who&s;e birth <HI>peace</HI> was proclaim|ed <HI>to the earth.</HI> For what would &s;o &s;oon de|&s;troy all the order of &s;ociety, and deform life with violence and ravage, as a permi&s;|&s;ion to every one to judge his own cau&s;e, and to apportion his own recompence for imagined injuries.</P>
<P>IT is difficult for a man of the &s;tricte&s;t ju|&s;tice not to favour him&s;elf too much in the calme&s;t moments of &s;olitary meditation. Every one wi&s;hes for the di&s;tinctions for which thou|&s;ands are wi&s;hing at the &s;ame time, in their own opinion, with better claims. He that, when his rea&s;on operates in its full force, can thus, by the mere prevalence of &s;elf-love, prefer him&s;elf to his fellow beings, is very
<PB N="100" REF="101">
unlikely to judge equitably when his pa&s;&s;ions are agitated by a &s;en&s;e of wrong, and his attention wholly engro&s;&s;ed by pain, in|tere&s;t, or danger. Whoever arrogates to him&s;elf the right of vengeance &s;hows how little he is qualified to decide his own claims, &s;ince he certainly demands what he would think unfit to be granted to another.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more apparent than that, however injured or however provoked, &s;ome mu&s;t at la&s;t be contented to forgive. For it can never be hoped, that he who fir&s;t commits an injury, will contentedly acquie&s;ce in the penalty required: the &s;ame haughtine&s;s of contempt and vehemence of de&s;ire, that prompt the act of inju&s;tice, will more &s;trong|ly incite its ju&s;tification: and re&s;entment can never &s;o exactly balance the puni&s;hment with the fault, but there will remain an over|plus of vengeance which even he who con|demns his fir&s;t action will think him&s;elf en|titled to retaliate, What then can en&s;ue but a continual exacerbation of hatred, an unex|tingui&s;hable feud, and ince&s;&s;ant reciprocation of mi&s;chief, a mutual vigilance to entrap, and eagerne&s;s to de&s;troy.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">
SINCE then the imaginary right of ven|geance mu&s;t be at la&s;t remitted, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to live in perpetual ho&s;tility, and equally impo&s;&s;ible that of two enemies, either &s;hould fir&s;t think him&s;elf obliged by ju&s;tice to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, it is &s;urely eligible to forgive early. Every pa&s;&s;ion is more ea&s;ily &s;ubdued before it has been long accu&s;tomed to po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the heart; every idea is obliterated with le&s;s difficulty as it has been more &s;lightly impre&s;&s;ed, and le&s;s frequently renewed. He who has often brooded over his wrongs, plea&s;|ed him&s;elf with &s;chemes of malignity, and glutted his pride with the fancied &s;upplications of humbled enmity, will not ea&s;ily open his bo&s;om to amity and reconciliation, or indulge the gentle &s;entiments of benevolence and peace.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;ie&s;t to forgive, while there is yet little to be forgiven. A &s;ingle injury may be &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the memory; but a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ill offices by degrees a&s;&s;ociates it&s;elf with every idea, a long conte&s;t involves &s;o many circum&s;tances, that every place and action will recal it to the mind, and fre&s;h
<PB N="102" REF="103">
remembrance of vexation mu&s;t &s;till enkindle rage, and irritate revenge.</P>
<P>A WISE man will make ha&s;te to forgive, be|cau&s;e he knows the true value of time, and will not &s;uffer it to pa&s;s away in unnece&s;&s;ary pain. He that willingly &s;uffers the corro&s;ions of in|veterate hatred, and gives up his days and nights to the gloom of malice, and perturba|tions of &s;tratagem, cannot &s;urely be &s;aid to con&s;ult his ea&s;e. Re&s;entment is a union of &s;orrow with malignity, a combination of a pa&s;&s;ion which all endeavour to avoid, with a pa&s;&s;ion which all concur to dete&s;t. The man who retires to meditate mi&s;chief, and to ex|a&s;perate his own rage; who&s;e thoughts are employed only on means of di&s;tre&s;s and con|trivances of ruin; who&s;e mind never pau&s;es from the remembrance of his own &s;ufferings, but to indulge &s;ome hope of enjoying the calamities of another, may ju&s;tly be number|ed among the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of human beings, among tho&s;e who are guilty without reward, who have neither the gladne&s;s of pro&s;perity, nor the calm of innocence.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="104">
WHOEVER con&s;iders the weakne&s;s both of him&s;elf and others will not long want per|&s;ua&s;ives to forgivene&s;s. We know not to what degree of malignity any injury is to be imputed; or how much its guilt, if we were to in&s;pect the mind of him that committed it, would be extenuated by mi&s;take, precipi|tance, or negligence; we cannot be certain how much more we feel than was intended to be inflicted, or how much we encrea&s;e the mi&s;chief to our&s;elves by voluntary aggrava|tions. We may charge to de&s;ign the effects of accident; we may think the blow violent only becau&s;e we have made our&s;elves delicate and tender; we are on every &s;ide in danger of error and of guilt, which we are certain to avoid only by &s;peedy forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>FROM this pacifick and harmle&s;s temper, thus propitious to others and our&s;elves, to do|me&s;tick tranquility and to &s;ocial happine&s;s, no man is with-held but by pride, by the fear of being in&s;ulted by his adver&s;ary or de&s;pi&s;ed by the world.</P>
<P>IT may be laid down as an unfailing and univer&s;al axiom, that, "all pride is abject

and mean." It is always an ignorant, lazy, or cowardly acquie&s;cence in a fal&s;e appearance of excellence, and proceeds not from con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of our attainments but in&s;en&s;ibility of our wants.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be great which is not right. Nothing which rea&s;on condemns can be &s;uit|able to the dignity of the human mind. To be driven by external motives from the path which our own heart approves, to give way to any thing but conviction, to &s;uffer the opi|nion of others to rule our choice, or over-power our re&s;olves, is to &s;ubmit tamely to the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t ignominious &s;lavery, and to re&s;ign the right of directing our own lives.</P>
<P>THE utmo&s;t excellence at which humanity can arrive, is a con&s;tant and determinate pur|&s;uit of virtue, without regard to pre&s;ent dan|gers or advantage; a continual reference of every action to the divine will; an habitual appeal to everla&s;ting ju&s;tice; and an unvaried elevation of the intellectual eye to the reward which per&s;everance only can obtain. But that pride which many who pre&s;ume to boa&s;t of generous &s;entiments, allow to regu|late
<PB N="105" REF="106">
their mea&s;ures, has nothing nobler in view than the approbation of men, of beings who&s;e &s;uperiority we are under no obligation to acknowledge, and who, when we have courted them with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity, can confer no valuable or permanent reward; of beings who ignorantly judge of what they do not under&s;tand, or partially determine what they never have examined; and who&s;e &s;en|tence is therefore of no weight till it has received the ratification of our own con|&s;cience.</P>
<P>HE that can de&s;cend to bribe &s;uffrages like the&s;e at the price of his innocence; he that can &s;uffer the delight of &s;uch acclamations to with-hold his attention from the commands of the univer&s;al &s;overeign, has little rea&s;on to congratulate him&s;elf upon the greatne&s;s of his mind; whenever he awakes to &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s and reflection, he mu&s;t become de&s;pica|ble in his own eyes, and &s;hrink with &s;hame from the remembrance of his cowardice and folly.</P>
<P>OF him that hopes to be forgiven it is in|di&s;pen&s;ibly required, that he forgive. It is
<PB N="106" REF="107">
therefore &s;uperfluous to urge any other mo|tive. On this great duty eternity is &s;u&s;pend|ed, and to him that refu&s;es to practi&s;e it, the throne of mercy is inacce&s;&s;ible, and the SA|VIOUR of the world has been born in vain.</P>

<P>OF the happine&s;s and mi&s;ery of our pre|&s;ent &s;tate, part ari&s;es from our &s;en&s;a|tions, and part from our opinions; part is di|&s;tributed by nature, and part is in a great mea&s;ure apportioned by our&s;elves. Po&s;itive plea&s;ure we cannot always obtain, and po&s;i|tive pain we often cannot remove. No man can give to his own plantations the fragrance of the <HI>Indian</HI> groves; nor will any precepts of philo&s;ophy enable him to withdraw his at|tention from wounds or di&s;ea&s;es. But the ne|gative
<PB N="107" REF="108">
infelicity which proceeds, not from the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;ufferings, but the ab&s;ence of en|joyments, will always yield to the remedies of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>ONE of the great arts of e&s;caping &s;u|perfluous unea&s;ine&s;s is to free our minds from the habit of comparing our condition with that of others on whom the ble&s;&s;ings of life are more bountifully be&s;towed, or with imagi|nary &s;tates of delight and &s;ecurity perhaps un|attainable by mortals. Few are placed in a &s;ituation &s;o gloomy and di&s;tre&s;ful, as not to &s;ee every day beings yet more forlorn and mi|&s;erable from whom they may learn to rejoice in their own lot.</P>
<P>No inconvenience is le&s;s &s;uperable by art or diligence than the inclemency of climates, and therefore, none affords more proper ex|erci&s;e for this philo&s;ophical ab&s;traction. A native of <HI>England,</HI> pinched with the fro&s;ts of <HI>December,</HI> may le&s;&s;en his affection for his own country, by &s;uffering his imagination to wan|der in the vales of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and &s;port among woods that are always green, and &s;treams that always murmur; but if he turns his thoughts
<PB N="108" REF="109">
towards the polar regions, and con&s;iders the nations to whom a great portion of the year is darkne&s;s, and who are condemned to pa&s;s weeks and months amid&s;t mountains of &s;now, he will &s;oon recover his tranquility, and while he &s;tirs his fire, or throws his cloak about him, reflect how much he owes to provi|dence, that he is not placed in <HI>Greenland</HI> or <HI>Siberia.</HI></P>
<P>THE barrenne&s;s of the earth, and the &s;eve|rity of the &s;kies in the&s;e dreary countries are &s;uch as might be expected to confine the mind wholly to the contemplation of nece&s;&s;ity and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;o that the care of e&s;caping death from cold and hunger, &s;hould leave no room for tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which, in lands of plenty, fluence conduct, or diver&s;ify characters; but the &s;ummer &s;hould be &s;pent only in pro|viding for the winter, and the winter in long|ing for the &s;ummer.</P>
<P>YET learned curio&s;ity is known to have found its way into the&s;e abodes of poverty and gloom: <HI>Lapland</HI> and <HI>Iceland</HI> have their hi&s;torians, their criticks, and their poets, and love, that extends his dominion wherever hu|manity
<PB N="109" REF="110">
can be found, perhaps exerts the &s;ame power in the <HI>Greenlander</HI>'s hut, as in the pa|laces of ea&s;tern monarchs.</P>
<P>IN one of the large caves to which the families of <HI>Greenland</HI> retire together to pa&s;s the cold months, and which may be termed their villages or cities, a youth and maid who came from different parts of the country, were &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed for their beauty, that they were called by the re&s;t of the inha|bitants <HI>Anningait</HI> and <HI>Ajut,</HI> from a &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;emblance to their ance&s;tors of the &s;ame names, who had been transformed of old into the &s;un and moon.</P>
<P><HI>ANNINGAIT,</HI> for &s;ome time heard the prai&s;es of <HI>Ajut</HI> with little emotion, but at la&s;t by frequent interviews became &s;en&s;ible of her charms, and fir&s;t made a di&s;covery of his af|fection, by inviting her with her parents to a fea&s;t, where he placed before <HI>Ajut</HI> the tail of a whale. <HI>Ajut</HI> &s;eemed not much delighted by this gallantry, yet, however, from that time, was ob&s;erved rarely to appear, but in a ve&s;t made of the &s;kin of a white deer; &s;he u&s;ed frequently to renew the black dye upon her
<PB N="110" REF="111">
hands and forehead, to adorn her &s;leeves with coral and &s;hells, and to braid her hair with great exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE elegance of her dre&s;s, and the judi|cious di&s;po&s;ition of her ornaments, had &s;uch an effect upon <HI>Anningait,</HI> that he could no longer be re&s;trained from a declaration of his love. He therefore compo&s;ed a poem in her prai&s;e, in which, among other heroick and tender &s;entiments he prote&s;ted, that "She was beautiful as the vernal willow, and fragrant as thyme upon the mountains; that her fingers were white as the teeth of the mor&s;e, and her &s;mile grateful as the di&s;&s;olution of the ice; that he would pur|&s;ue her, though &s;he &s;hould pa&s;s the &s;nows of the midland cliffs, or &s;eek &s;helter in the caves of the ea&s;tern canibals; that he would tear her from the embraces of the genius of the rocks, &s;natch her from the paws of <HI>Amarce,</HI> and re&s;cue her from the ravine of <HI>Hafgufa</HI>;" he concluded with a wi&s;h, that, "whoever &s;hall attempt to hin|der his union with <HI>Ajut,</HI> might be buried without his bow, and that in the land of &s;ouls his &s;kull might &s;erve for no other u&s;e
<PB N="111" REF="112">
than to catch the droppings of the &s;tarry lamps."</P>
<P>THIS ode being univer&s;ally applauded, it was expected that <HI>Ajut</HI> would &s;oon yield to &s;uch fervour and accompli&s;hments; but <HI>Ajut,</HI> with the natural haughtine&s;s of beauty, ex|pected the u&s;ual forms of court&s;hip; and before &s;he would confe&s;s her&s;elf conquer|ed, the &s;un returned, the ice broke, and the &s;ea&s;on of labour called all to their em|ployments.</P>
<P>ANNINGAIT and <HI>Ajut</HI> for a time al|ways went out in the &s;ame boat, and divided whatever was caught. <HI>Anningait,</HI> in the &s;ight of his mi&s;tre&s;s, lo&s;t no opportunity of &s;igna|lizing his courage; he attacked the &s;ea-hor&s;es on the ice; pur&s;ued the &s;eals into the water; and leaped upon the back of the whale, while he was yet &s;truggling with the remains of life. Nor was his diligence le&s;s to accumulate all that could be nece&s;&s;ary to make winter comfortable; he dried the roe of fi&s;hes, and the fle&s;h of &s;eals; he entrapped deer and foxes, and dre&s;&s;ed their &s;kins to adorn his
<PB N="112" REF="113">
bride; he fea&s;ted her with eggs from the rocks; and &s;trewed her tent with flowers.</P>
<P>IT happened that a tempe&s;t drove the fi&s;h to a di&s;tant part of the coa&s;t before <HI>Anningait</HI> had compleated his &s;tore; he therefore en|treated <HI>Ajut,</HI> that &s;he would at la&s;t grant him her hand, and accompany him to that part of the country, whither he was now &s;ummoned by nece&s;&s;ity. <HI>Ajut</HI> thought him not yet en|titled to &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ion, but propo&s;ed, as a trial of his con&s;tancy, that he &s;hould return at the end of &s;ummer to the cavern where their acquaintance commenced, and there ex|pect the reward of his a&s;&s;iduities. "O virgin, beautiful as the &s;un &s;hining on the water, con&s;ider," &s;aid <HI>Anningait,</HI> "what thou ha&s;t required. How ea&s;ily may my return be precluded by a &s;udden fro&s;t or unexpected fogs; then mu&s;t the night be pa&s;t without my <HI>Ajut.</HI> We live not, my fair, in tho&s;e fabled countries, which lying &s;trangers &s;o wantonly de&s;cribe; where the whole year is divided into &s;hort days and nights; where the &s;ame habitation &s;erves for &s;ummer and winter; where they rai&s;e hou&s;es in rows above the ground; dwell together from

year to year, with flocks of tame animals grazing in the fields about them; can tra|vel at any time from one place to another through ways enclo&s;ed with trees, or over walls rai&s;ed upon the inland waters; and direct their cour&s;e through wide countries by the &s;ight of green hills or &s;cattered build|ings. Even in &s;ummer we have no means of cro&s;&s;ing the mountains, who&s;e &s;nows are never di&s;&s;olved; nor can remove to any di&s;tant re&s;idence, but in our boats coa&s;ting the bays. Con&s;ider, <HI>Ajut</HI>; a few &s;ummer days, and a few winter nights, and the life of man is at an end. Night is the time of ea&s;e, and fe&s;tivity, of revels and gaiety; but what will be the flaming lamp, the de|licious &s;eal, or the &s;oft oil, without the &s;mile of <HI>Ajut?</HI>"</P>
<P>THE eloquence of <HI>Anningait</HI> was vain; the maid continued inexorable, and they parted with ardent promi&s;es to meet again before the night of winter.</P>

<P><HI>ANNINGAIT,</HI> however di&s;compo&s;ed by the dilatory coyne&s;s of <HI>Ajut,</HI> was yet re&s;olved to omit no tokens of amorous re&s;pect, and therefore, pre&s;ented her at his departure with the &s;kins of &s;even white fawns, of five &s;wans and eleven &s;eals, with three mar|ble lamps, ten ve&s;&s;els of &s;eal oil, and a large kettle of bra&s;s, which he had purcha&s;ed from a &s;hip, at the price of half a whale and two horns of &s;ea unicorns.</P>
<P><HI>AJUT</HI> was &s;o much affected by the fondne&s;s of her lover, or &s;o much overpower|ed by his magnificence, that &s;he followed him to the &s;ea&s;ide, and, when &s;he &s;aw him enter the boat, wi&s;hed aloud, that he might return with plenty of &s;kins and oil; that neither the mermaids might &s;natch him into the deeps,
<PB N="115" REF="116">
nor the &s;pirits of the rocks confine him in their caverns.</P>
<P>SHE &s;tood a while to gaze upon the de|parting ve&s;&s;el, and then returning to her hut &s;ilent and dejected, laid a&s;ide, from that hour, her white deer &s;kin, &s;uffered her hair to &s;pread unbraided on her &s;houlders, and forbore to mix in the dances of the maidens. She en|deavoured to divert her thoughts by continual application to feminine employments, gather|ed mo&s;s for the winter lamps, and dried gra&s;s to line the boots of <HI>Anningait.</HI> Of the &s;kins which he had be&s;towed upon her &s;he made a fi&s;hing coat, a &s;mall boat, and tent, all of exqui&s;ite manufacture, and while &s;he was thus bu&s;ied, &s;olaced her labours with a &s;ong, in which &s;he prayed, "that her lover might have hands &s;tronger than the paws of the bear, and feet &s;wifter than the feet of the raindeer; that his dart might never err, and that his boat might never leak; that he might never &s;tumble on the ice, nor faint in the water; that the &s;eal might ru&s;h on his harpoon, and the wounded whale might da&s;h the waves in vain."</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117">
THE large boats in which the <HI>Greenlanders</HI> tran&s;port their families are always rowed by women, for a man will not deba&s;e him&s;elf by work, which requires neither &s;kill nor cou|rage. <HI>Anningait</HI> was therefore expo&s;ed by idlene&s;s to the ravages of pa&s;&s;ion. He went thrice to the &s;tern of the boat, with an intent to leap into the water, and &s;wim back to his mi&s;tre&s;s; but recollecting the mi&s;ery which they mu&s;t endure in the winter without oil for the lamp, or &s;kins for the bed, he re&s;olved to employ the weeks of ab&s;ence in provi&s;ion for a night of plenty and felicity. He then compo&s;ed his emotions as he could, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed in wild numbers and uncouth images, his hopes, his &s;orrows, and his fears. "O life," &s;ays he, "&s;rail and uncertain! where &s;hall wretched man find thy re&s;emblance but in ice floating on the ocean? It towers on high, it &s;parkles from afar, while the &s;torms drive and the waters beat it, the &s;un melts it above and the rocks &s;hatter it below. What art thou deceitful plea&s;ure, but a &s;udden blaze &s;treaming from the north, which plays a moment on the eye, mocks the traveller with the hopes of light, and then vani&s;hes forever? What,
<PB N="117" REF="118">
love, art thou but a whirlpool, which we approach without knowledge of our dan|ger, drawn on by imperceptible degrees, till we have lo&s;t all power of re&s;i&s;tance and e&s;cape? Till I fixed my eyes on the graces of <HI>Ajut,</HI> while I had yet not called her to the banquet, I was carele&s;s as the &s;leeping mor&s;e, I was merry as the &s;ingers in the &s;tars. Why, <HI>Ajut,</HI> did I gaze upon thy graces? why, my fair, did I call thee to the banquet? Yet, be faithful, my love, remember <HI>Anningait,</HI> and meet my return with the &s;mile of virginity. I will cha&s;e the deer, I will &s;ubdue the whale, re&s;i&s;tle&s;s as the fro&s;t of darkne&s;s, and unwearied as the &s;ummer &s;un. In a few weeks, I &s;hall return pro&s;perous and wealthy; then &s;hall the rocfi&s;h and the porpoi&s;e, fea&s;t thy kin|dred; the fox and hare &s;hall cover thy couch; the tough hide of the &s;eal &s;hall &s;helter thee from cold; and the fat of the whale illuminate thy dwelling."</P>
<P><HI>ANNINGAIT</HI> having with the&s;e &s;enti|ments con&s;oled his grief and animated his in|du&s;try, found that they had now coa&s;ted the headland, and &s;aw the whales &s;pouting at a
<PB N="118" REF="119">
di&s;tance. He therefore placed him&s;elf in his fi&s;hing boat, called his a&s;&s;ociates to their &s;e|veral employments, plied his oar and harpoon with incredible courage and dexterity, and, by dividing his time between the chace and fi&s;hery, &s;u&s;pended the mi&s;eries of ab&s;ence and &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P><HI>AJUT,</HI> in the mean time, notwith&s;tand|ing her neglected dre&s;s, happened as &s;he was drying &s;ome &s;kins in the &s;un, to catch the eye of <HI>Norng&s;uk,</HI> on his return from hunting. <HI>Norng&s;uk</HI> was of birth truly illu&s;trious. His mother had died in childbirth, and his father, the mo&s;t expert fi&s;her of <HI>Greenland,</HI> had pe|ri&s;hed by too clo&s;e pur&s;uit of the whale. His dignity was equalled by his riches; he was ma&s;ter of four mens and two womens boats, had ninety tubs of oil in his winter habita|tion, and five and twenty &s;eals buried in the &s;now again&s;t the &s;ea&s;on of darkne&s;s. When he &s;aw the beauty of <HI>Ajut,</HI> he immediately threw over her the &s;kin of a deer that he had taken, and &s;oon after pre&s;ented her with a branch of coral. <HI>Ajut</HI> refu&s;ed his gifts, and determined to admit no lover in the place of <HI>Anningait.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120">
<HI>NORNGSUK,</HI> thus rejected, had re|cour&s;e to &s;tratagem. He knew that <HI>Ajut</HI> would con&s;ult an <HI>Angekkok,</HI> or diviner, con|cerning the fate of her lover, and the felicity of her future life. He therefore applied him|&s;elf to the mo&s;t celebrated <HI>Angekkok</HI> of that part of the country, and by a pre&s;ent of two &s;eals and a marble kettle, obtained a promi&s;e that when <HI>Ajut</HI> &s;hould con&s;ult him, he would declare that her lover was in the land of &s;ouls. <HI>Ajut,</HI> in a &s;hort time, brought him a coat made by her&s;elf, and enquired what events were to befal her, with a&s;&s;urances of a much larger reward at the return of <HI>Anningait</HI> if the prediction &s;hould flatter her de&s;ires. The <HI>Angekkok</HI> knew the way to riches, and fore|told that <HI>Anningait,</HI> having already caught two whales, would &s;oon return home with a large boat laden with provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>THIS progno&s;tication &s;he was ordered to keep &s;ecret, and <HI>Norng&s;uk</HI> depending upon his artifice renewed his addre&s;&s;es with greater confidence; but finding his &s;uit &s;till un&s;ucce&s;&s;|ful, applied him&s;elf to her parents with gifts and promi&s;es. The wealth of <HI>Greenland</HI> is too powerful for the virtue of a <HI>Greenlander</HI>;
<PB N="120" REF="121">
they forgot the merit and the pre&s;ents of <HI>An|ningait,</HI> and decreed <HI>Ajut</HI> to the embrace of <HI>Norng&s;uk.</HI> She entreated; &s;he remon&s;trated; &s;he wept, and raved; but finding riches irre|&s;i&s;tible, fled away into the uplands, and lived in a cave upon &s;uch berries as &s;he could ga|ther, and the birds or hares which &s;he had the fortune to en&s;nare, taking care at an hour when &s;he was not likely to be found, to view the &s;ea every day, that her lover might not mi&s;s her at his return.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t &s;he &s;aw the great boat in which <HI>Anningait</HI> had departed, &s;tealing &s;low and heavy laden along the coa&s;t. She ran with all the impatience of affection to catch her lover in her arms, and relate her con&s;tancy and &s;ufferings. When the company reached the land they informed her, that <HI>Anningait,</HI> after the fi&s;hery was ended, being unable to &s;upport the &s;low pa&s;&s;age of the ve&s;&s;el of car|riage, had &s;et out before them in his fi&s;hing boat, and they expected at their arrival to have found him on &s;hore.</P>
<P><HI>AJUT,</HI> di&s;tracted at this intelligence, was about to fly again into the hills without
<PB N="121" REF="122">
knowing why, though &s;he was now in the hands of her parents, who forced her back to their own hut, and endeavoured to comfort her; but when at la&s;t they retired to re&s;t, <HI>Ajut</HI> went down to the beach, where finding a fi&s;hing boat, &s;he entered it without he&s;itation, and telling tho&s;e who wondered at her ra&s;h|ne&s;s, that &s;he was going in &s;earch of <HI>An|ningait,</HI> rowed away with great &s;wiftne&s;s, and was &s;een no more.</P>
<P>THE fate of the&s;e lovers gave occa&s;ion to various fictions and conjectures. Some are of opinion that they were changed into &s;tars; others imagine that <HI>Anningait</HI> was &s;eized in his pa&s;&s;age by the genius of the rocks, and that <HI>Ajut</HI> was transformed into a mermaid, and &s;till continues to &s;eek her lover in the de|&s;arts of the &s;ea. But the general per&s;ua&s;ion is, that they are both in that part of the land of &s;ouls where the &s;un never &s;ets, where oil is always fre&s;h, and provi&s;ions always warm. The virgins &s;ometimes throw a thimble, and a needle into the bay, from which the haple&s;s maid departed; and when a <HI>Greenlander</HI> would prai&s;e any couple for virtuous affection, he de|clares, that they love like <HI>Anningait</HI> and <HI>Ajut.</HI></P>

<P>NONE of the de&s;ires dictated by vanity is more general or le&s;s blamable than that of being di&s;tingui&s;hed for the arts of con|ver&s;ation. Other accompli&s;hments may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed without opportunity of exerting them, or wanted without danger that the de|&s;ect can often be remarked; but as no man can live otherwi&s;e than in an hermitage, without hourly plea&s;ure or vexation from the fondne&s;s or neglect of tho&s;e about him, the faculty of giving plea&s;ure is of continual u&s;e. Few are more frequently envied than tho&s;e who have the power of forcing attention wherever they come, who&s;e entrance is con|&s;idered as a promi&s;e of &s;elicity, and who&s;e de|parture is lamented, like the rece&s;s of the &s;un from northern climates, as a privation of all that enlivens fancy or in&s;pirits gaiety.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="124">
IT is apparent, that to excellence in this valuable art &s;ome peculiar qualifications are nece&s;&s;ary; for every one's experience will in|form him, that the plea&s;ure which men are able to give in conver&s;ation, holds no &s;tated proportion to their knowledge or their virtue. Many find their way to the tables and the parties of tho&s;e who never con&s;ider them as of the lea&s;t importance in any other place; we have all, at one time or other, been content to love tho&s;e whom we could not e&s;teem, and been per&s;uaded to try the dangerous experi|ment of admitting him for a companion, whom we knew to be too ignorant for a coun&s;ellor, and too treacherous for a friend.</P>
<P>I QUESTION whether &s;ome abatement of character is not almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to general acceptance. Few &s;pend their time with much &s;atisfaction under the eye of unconte&s;ted &s;u|periority, and therefore, among tho&s;e who are received with univer&s;al welcome, and who&s;e pre&s;ence is courted at a&s;&s;embles of jollity, there are &s;eldom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ound men eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed for powers of nature or acqui|&s;itions of &s;tudy. The wit who&s;e vivacity con|demns <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lower tongues to &s;ilence, the &s;cholar
<PB N="124" REF="125">
who&s;e knowledge allows no man to fan&s;y that he in&s;tructs him, the critick who &s;uffers no fallacy to pa&s;s undetected, the rea&s;oner who condemns idlene&s;s to thought and neg|ligence to attention, are generally prai&s;ed and &s;eared, reverenced and avoided.</P>
<P>HE that would plea&s;e mu&s;t rarely aim at &s;uch excellence as depre&s;&s;es his hearers in their own opinion, or debars them from the hope of contributing reciprocally to the entertain|ment of the company. Merriment extorted by &s;allies of imagination, &s;prightline&s;s of re|mark, or quickne&s;s of reply, is too often what the <HI>Latins</HI> call, the <HI>Sardinian Laughter,</HI> a di&s;tortion of the face without gladne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on, no &s;tile of conver&s;ation is more exten&s;ively acceptable than the nar|rative. He who has &s;tored his memory with &s;light anecdotes, private incidents, and per|&s;onal particularities, &s;eldom fails to find his audience favourable. Almo&s;t every man li&s;tens with eagerne&s;s to contemporary hi&s;tory; for almo&s;t every man has &s;ome real or imaginary
<PB N="125" REF="126">
connection with a celebrated character, &s;ome de&s;ire to advance, or oppo&s;e a ri&s;ing name. Vanity often co-operates with curio&s;ity. He that is a hearer in one place qualifies him|&s;elf to become a &s;peaker in another; for though he cannot comprehend a &s;eries of ar|gument, or tran&s;port the volatile &s;pirit of wit with evaporation, he yet thinks him&s;elf able to trea&s;ure up the various incidents of a &s;tory, and plea&s;es his hopes with the information which he &s;hall give to &s;ome inferior &s;ociety.</P>
<P>NARRATIVES are for the mo&s;t part heard without envy, becau&s;e they are not &s;uppo&s;ed to imply any intellectual qualities above the common rate. To be acquainted with facts not yet ecchoed by plebeian mouths, may happen to one man as well as to another, and to relate them when they are known, has in appearance &s;o little difficulty, that every one concludes him&s;elf equal to the ta&s;k.</P>
<P>BUT it is not ea&s;y, and in &s;ome &s;ituations not po&s;&s;ible, to accumulate &s;uch a &s;tock of materials, as may &s;upport the expence of continual narration; and it frequently hap|pens, that they who attempt this method of

ingratiating them&s;elves, plea&s;e only at the fir&s;t interview, and, for want of new &s;upplies of intelligence, wear out their &s;tories by conti|nual repetition.</P>
<P>THERE would be, therefore, little hope of obtaining the prai&s;e of a good companion, were it not to be gained by more compen|dious methods; but &s;uch is the kindne&s;s of mankind to all except tho&s;e who a&s;pire to real merit and rational dignity, that every under|&s;tanding may find &s;ome way to benevolence, and whoever is not envied may learn the art of procuring love. We are willing to be plea&s;ed, but we are not willing to admire; we favour the mirth or officiou&s;ne&s;s that &s;olicits our re|gard, but oppo&s;e the worth or &s;pirit that en|forces it.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t place among tho&s;e that plea&s;e becau&s;e they de&s;ire only to plea&s;e, is due to the <HI>merry fellow,</HI> who&s;e laugh is loud, and who&s;e voice is &s;trong; who is ready to eccho every je&s;t with ob&s;treperous approbation, and countenance every frolick with vociferations of applau&s;e. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to a merry

fellow to have in him&s;elf any fund of jocu|larity, or force of conception; it is &s;ufficient that he always appears in the highe&s;t exalta|tion of gladne&s;s, for the greater part of man|kind are gay or &s;erious by infection, and fol|low without re&s;i&s;tance the attraction of ex|ample.</P>
<P>NEXT to the merry fellow is the <HI>good-natured man,</HI> a being generally without bene|volence or any other virtue than &s;uch as in|dolence and in&s;en&s;ibility confer. The cha|racteri&s;tick of a <HI>good-natured man</HI> is to bear a joke; to &s;it unmoved and unaffected amid&s;t noi&s;e and turbulence, profanene&s;s and ob&s;ceni|ty; to hear every tale without contradiction; to endure in&s;ult without reply; and to follow the &s;tream of folly whatever cour&s;e it &s;hall happen to take. The good-natured man is commonly the darling of the petty wits, with whom they exerci&s;e them&s;elves in the rudi|ments of raillery; for he never takes advan|tage of failings, nor di&s;concerts a puny &s;atiri&s;t with unexpected &s;arca&s;ms, but while the gla&s;s continues to circulate contentedly bears the
<PB N="128" REF="129">
expence of uninterrupted laughter, and re|tires rejoicing at his own importance.</P>
<P>THE <HI>mode&s;t man</HI> is a companion of a yet lower rank, who&s;e only power of giving plea|&s;ure is not to interrupt it. The mode&s;t man &s;atisfies him&s;elf with peaceful &s;ilence, which all his companions are candid enough to con|&s;ider as proceeding not from inability to &s;peak, but willingne&s;s to hear.</P>
<P>MANY without being able to attain any general character of excellence, have &s;ome &s;ingle art of entertainment which &s;erves them as a pa&s;&s;port through the world. One I have known for fifteen years the darling of a week|ly club, becau&s;e every night preci&s;ely at ele|ven, he begins his favourite &s;ong, and during the vocal performance by corre&s;pondent mo|tions of his hand chalks out a giant upon the wall. Another has endeared him&s;elf to a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of acquaintances by &s;itting among them with his wig rever&s;ed; another by contriving to &s;mut the no&s;e of any &s;tranger who was to be initiated in the club; another by purring like a cat, and then pretending to be frighted; and another by yelping like a

hound, and calling to the drawers to drive out the dog.</P>
<P>SUCH are the arts by which cheerfulne&s;s is promoted, and &s;ometimes friend&s;hip e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; arts, which tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e them, &s;hould not rigorou&s;ly blame, except when they are practi&s;ed at the expence of innocence; for it is always nece&s;&s;ary to be loved, but not always nece&s;&s;ary to be reverenced.</P>

<P>THE world &s;carcely affords opportunities of making any ob&s;ervation more fre|quently, than on fal&s;e claims to prai&s;e and re|putation. Almo&s;t every man wa&s;tes part of his life in attempts to di&s;play qualities which

he does not po&s;&s;e&s;s, and to gain applau&s;e which he cannot keep; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to enter any a&s;&s;embly without &s;eeing one part offended or diverted by the o&s;tentation of the other.</P>
<P>OF the&s;e pretenders it is fit to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e who endeavour to deceive from them who are deceived; tho&s;e who by de&s;igned im|po&s;tures promote their intere&s;t or gratify their pride, from them who mean only to force into regard their latent excellencies and neg|lected virtues; who believe them&s;elves quali|fied to in&s;truct or plea&s;e, and therefore invite the notice of mankind.</P>
<P>THE artful and fraudulent u&s;urpers of di&s;tinction de&s;erve greater &s;everities than ridicule and contempt, &s;ince they are &s;el|dom content with empty prai&s;e, but are in&s;ti|gated by pa&s;&s;ions more pernicious than vanity. They con&s;ider the reputation which they en|deavour to e&s;tabli&s;h as nece&s;&s;ary to the accom|pli&s;hment of &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent de&s;ign, and va|lue prai&s;e only as it may conduce to the &s;ucce&s;s of avarice or ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="132">
THE commercial world is very frequently put into confu&s;ion by the bankrupcy of mer|chants, that a&s;&s;umed the &s;plendour of wealth only to obtain the privilege of trading with the &s;tock of other men, and of contracting debts which nothing but lucky ca&s;ualties could enable them to pay; till after having &s;upport|ed their appearance awhile by a tumultuary magnificence of boundle&s;s traffick, they &s;ink at once, and drag down into poverty tho&s;e whom their equipages had induced to tru&s;t them.</P>
<P>AMONG wretches that place their happi|ne&s;s in the favour of beings whom only high titles or large e&s;tates &s;et above them&s;elves, no|thing is more common than to boa&s;t of con|fidence which they do not enjoy; to &s;ell pro|mi&s;es which they know their intere&s;t unable to perform; and to reimbur&s;e the tribute which they pay to &s;ome pro&s;perous &s;lave, from the contributions of meaner dependents, whom they can amu&s;e with tales of their influence and hopes of their &s;olicitation.</P>
<P>YET among &s;ome too thoughtle&s;s or vo|latile for avarice or ambition, may be found
<PB N="132" REF="133">
a &s;pecies of fal&s;hood more dete&s;table than the levee or exchange can &s;hew. There are men that boa&s;t of debaucheries, of which they ne|ver had addre&s;s to be guilty; ruin by lewd tales the characters of women to whom they are &s;carcely known, or by whom they have been rejected; de&s;troy in a drunken frolick the happine&s;s of families; bla&s;t the bloom of beauty; and intercept the reward of virtue.</P>
<P>OTHER artifices of fal&s;hood, though ut|terly unworthy of an ingenuous mind, are yet not to be ranked with flagitious enormi|ties, nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to incite the ven|geance of &s;anguinary ju&s;tice again&s;t them, &s;ince they may be adequately puni&s;hed by detection and laughter. The traveller who de&s;cribes cities which he has never &s;een; the &s;quire who at his return from <HI>London,</HI> tells of his intimacy with nobles to whom he has only bowed in the park or coffee-hou&s;e; the author who entertains his admirers with &s;tories of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he gives to wits of a higher rank; the city dame who is careful to introduce the mention of her vi&s;its at great hou&s;es where &s;he happens to know the cook|maid,

are &s;urely &s;uch harmle&s;s animals as truth her&s;elf may be content to de&s;pi&s;e with|out de&s;iring to hurt them.</P>
<P>BUT of the multitudes who &s;truggle in vain for di&s;tinction, and di&s;play their own merits only to feel more acutely the &s;ting of neglect, a great part are wholly innocent of deceit, and are betrayed by infatuation and credulity to that &s;corn with which the univer|&s;al love of prai&s;e incites us all to drive feeble competitors out of our way.</P>
<P>FEW men &s;urvey them&s;elves with &s;o much &s;everity, as not to admit prejudices in their own favour, which an artful flatterer may gradually &s;trengthen, till wi&s;hes for a par|ticular qualification are improved to hopes of attainment, and hopes of attainment to belief of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Such flatterers every one will find who has power to reward their a&s;&s;iduities. Wherever there is wealth, there will be de|pendance and expectation, and wherever there is dependance, there will be an emulation of &s;ervility.</P>

MANY of the follies which provoke gene|ral cen&s;ure are the effects of &s;uch vanity, as however it might have wantoned in the ima|gination, would &s;carcely have dared the pub|lick eye, had it not been animated and em|boldened by flattery. Whatever difficulty there may be in the knowledge of our&s;elves, &s;carcely any one fails to &s;u&s;pect his own im|perfections, till he is elevated by others to confidence. Almo&s;t every man is naturally mode&s;t and timorous, but fear and &s;hame are unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, and who&s;oever helps to re|move them is received with kindne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>TURPICULA</HI> was born the heire&s;s of a large e&s;tate, and having lo&s;t her mother in her infancy, was committed to the care of a go|verne&s;s, whom misfortunes had reduced to accept any terms on which &s;he could be de|cently &s;upported. The fondne&s;s of <HI>Turpicu|la</HI>'s father would not &s;uffer him to tru&s;t her at a publick &s;chool, but he took care to hire dome&s;tick teachers, and be&s;towed on her all the accompli&s;hments which wealth could pur|cha&s;e.

<P><HI>TURPICULA</HI> &s;aw nothing but ob&s;equi|ou&s;ne&s;s, and heard nothing but commenda|tions; becau&s;e few approached her who did not con&s;ider it as their intere&s;t to plea&s;e.

<P>AMONG the emirs and vi&s;iers, the &s;ons of valour and of wi&s;dom, that &s;tand at the corners of the <HI>Indian</HI> throne, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the coun&s;els or conduct the wars of the po|&s;terity of <HI>Timur,</HI> the fir&s;t place was long held by <HI>Morad</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Hanuth. Morad</HI> having &s;ignalized him&s;elf in many battles and &s;ieges,
<PB N="137" REF="138">
was rewarded with the government of a pro|vince, from which the fame of his wi&s;dom and moderation was wafted to the pinacles of <HI>Agra,</HI> by the prayers of tho&s;e whom his admini&s;tration made happy. The emperor called him into his pre&s;ence, and gave into his hand the keys of riches, and the &s;abre of command. The voice of <HI>Morad</HI> was heard from the cliffs of <HI>Taurus</HI> to the <HI>Indian</HI> ocean, every tongue faultered in his pre&s;ence, and every eye was ca&s;t down before him.</P>
<P><HI>MORAD</HI> lived many years in pro&s;pe|rity; every day encrea&s;ed his wealth, and extended his influence. The &s;ages repeated his maxims, the captains of thou&s;ands waited his commands. Competition withdrew into the cavern of envy, and di&s;content trembled at her own murmurs. But human greatne&s;s is &s;hort and tran&s;itory, as the odour of in|cen&s;e in the fire. The &s;un grew weary of gilding the palaces of <HI>Morad,</HI> the clouds of &s;orrow gathered round his head, and the tem|pe&s;t of hatred roared about his dwelling.</P>
<P><HI>MORAD</HI> &s;aw ruin ha&s;tily approaching. The fir&s;t that for&s;ook him were his poets;
<PB N="138" REF="139">
their example was followed by all tho&s;e whom he had rewarded for contributing to his plea|&s;ures, and only a few, who&s;e virtue had enti|tled them to favour, were now to be &s;een in his hall or chambers. He felt his danger, and pro&s;trated him&s;elf at the foot of the throne. His accu&s;ers were confident and loud, his friends &s;tood contented with frigid neutrality, and the voice of truth was overborn by cla|mour. He was dive&s;ted of his power, de|prived of his acqui&s;itions, and condemned to pa&s;s the re&s;t of his life on his hereditary e&s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>MORAD</HI> had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to crouds and bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;upplicants and flat|tery, that he knew not how to fill up his hours in &s;olitude; he &s;aw with regret the &s;un ri&s;e to force a new day on his eye for which he had no u&s;e; and envied the &s;avage that wanders in the de&s;art, becau&s;e he has no time vacant from the calls of nature, but is always cha&s;ing his prey, or &s;leeping in his den.</P>
<P>HIS di&s;content in time vitiated his con&s;ti|tution, and a &s;low di&s;ea&s;e &s;eized upon him.
<PB N="139" REF="140">
He refu&s;ed phy&s;ick, neglected exerci&s;e, and lay down on his couch peevi&s;h and re&s;tle&s;s, rather afraid to dye than de&s;irous to live. His dome&s;ticks for a time redoubled their a&s;&s;idui|ties, but finding that no officiou&s;ne&s;s could &s;ooth nor exactne&s;s &s;atisfy, &s;oon gave way to negligence and &s;loth, and he that once com|manded nations, often langui&s;hed in his cham|ber without an attendant.</P>
<P>IN this melancholy &s;tate, he commanded me&s;&s;engers to recal his elde&s;t &s;on <HI>Abouzaid</HI> from the army. <HI>Abouzaid</HI> was alarmed at the account of his father's &s;ickne&s;s, and ha&s;ted by long journeys to his place of re&s;idence. <HI>Mo|rad</HI> was yet living, and felt his &s;trength return at the embraces of his &s;on, then commanding him to &s;it down at his bed&s;ide, "<HI>Abouzaid,</HI>" &s;ays he, "thy father has no more to hope or fear from the inhabitants of the earth, the cold hand of the angel of death is now upon him, and the voracious grave howls for his prey. Hear therefore the precepts of an|cient experience, let not my la&s;t in&s;truc|tions i&s;&s;ue forth in vain. Thou ha&s;t &s;een me happy and calamitous, thou ha&s;t beheld my exaltation and my fall. My power is

<P><HI>MORAD</HI> expired in a few hours. <HI>Abou|zaid,</HI> after the months of mourning, deter|mined
<PB N="141" REF="142">
to regulate his conduct by his father's precepts, and cultivate the love of mankind by every art of kindne&s;s and endearment. He wi&s;ely con&s;idered, that dome&s;tick happine&s;s was fir&s;t to be &s;ecured, and that none have &s;o much power of doing good or hurt, as tho&s;e who are pre&s;ent in the hour of negligence, hear the bur&s;ts of thoughtle&s;s merriment, and ob&s;erve the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of unguarded pa&s;&s;ion. He therefore augmented the pay of all his at|tendants, and requited every exertion of un|common diligence by &s;upernumerary gra|tuities. While he congratulated him&s;elf upon the fidelity and affection of his family, he was in the night alarmed by robbers, who, being pur&s;ued and taken, declared, that they had been admitted by one of his &s;ervants; the &s;ervant immediately confe&s;&s;ed, that he unbarred the door, becau&s;e another not more worthy of confidence was entru&s;ted with the keys.</P>
<P><HI>ABOUZAID</HI> was thus convinced that a dependant could not ea&s;ily be made a friend; and that while many were &s;oliciting for the fir&s;t rank of favour, all tho&s;e would be alie|nated whom he di&s;appointed. He therefore
<PB N="142" REF="143">
re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ociate with a few equal compa|nions &s;elected from among the chief men of the province. With the&s;e he lived happily for a time, till familiarity &s;et them free from re|&s;traint, and every man thought him&s;elf at li|berty to indulge his own caprice, and ad|vance his own opinions. They then di&s;turbed each other with contrariety of inclinations, and difference of &s;entiments, and <HI>Abouzaid</HI> was nece&s;&s;itated to offend one party by con|currence, or both by indifference.</P>
<P>HE afterwards determined to avoid a clo&s;e union with beings &s;o di&s;cordant in their na|ture, and to diffu&s;e him&s;elf in a larger circle. He practi&s;ed the &s;mile of univer&s;al courte&s;y, and invited all to his table, but admitted none to his retirements. Many who had been re|jected in his choice of friend&s;hip now refu&s;ed to accept his acquaintance; and of tho&s;e whom plenty and magnificence drew to his table, every one pre&s;&s;ed forward toward inti|macy, thought him&s;elf overlooked in the croud, and murmured becau&s;e he was not di&s;tingui&s;hed above the re&s;t. By degrees all made advances, and all re&s;ented repul&s;e. The table was then covered with delicacies in
<PB N="143" REF="144">
vain; the mu&s;ick &s;ounded in empty rooms; and <HI>Abouzaid</HI> was left to form in &s;olitude &s;ome new &s;cheme of plea&s;ure or &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>RESOLVING now to try the force of gra|titude, he enquired for men of &s;cience, who&s;e merit was ob&s;cured by poverty. His hou&s;e was &s;oon crouded with poets, &s;culptors, pain|ters, and de&s;igners, who wantoned in unex|perienced plenty, and employed their powers in celebration of their patron. But in a &s;hort time they forgot the di&s;tre&s;s from which they had been re&s;cued, and began to con&s;ider their deliverer as a wretch of narrow capacity, who was growing great by works which he could not perform, and whom they overpaid by conde&s;cending to accept his bounties. <HI>Abou|zaid</HI> heard their murmurs and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, and from that hour continued blind to colours, and deaf to panegyrick.</P>
<P>AS the &s;ons of art departed muttering threats of perpetual infamy, <HI>Abouzaid,</HI> who &s;tood at the gate, called to him <HI>Hamet</HI> the poet. "<HI>Hamet,</HI>" &s;aid he, "thy ingratitude has put an end to my hopes and experiments; I

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mr. RAMBLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been four days confined to my chamber by a cold, which has already kept me from three plays, nine &s;ales, five &s;hows, and &s;ix card-tables, and put me &s;e|venteen vi&s;its behind hand; and the doctor tells my mamma, that if I fret and cry, it will &s;ettle in my head, and I &s;hall not be &s;it
<PB N="145" REF="146">
to be &s;een the&s;e &s;ix weeks. But, dear Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> how can I help it? at this very time <HI>Meli&s;&s;a</HI> is dancing with the prettie&s;t gen|tleman;&mdash;&s;he will breakfa&s;t with him to-mor|row, and then run to two auctions, and hear compliments, and have pre&s;ents; then &s;he will be dre&s;t, and vi&s;it, and get a ticket to the play; then go to cards, and win, and come home with two flambeaus before her chair. Dear Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> who can bear it?</P>
<P>MY aunt has ju&s;t brought me a bundle of your papers for my amu&s;ement. She &s;ays, you are a philo&s;opher, and will teach me to moderate my de&s;ires, and look upon the world with indifference. But, dear &s;ir, I do not wi&s;h nor intend to moderate my de&s;ires, nor can I think it proper to look upon the world with indifference, till the world looks with indifference on me. I have been forced, how|ever, to &s;it this morning a whole quarter of an hour with your paper before my face; but ju&s;t as my aunt came in, <HI>Phyllida</HI> had brought me a letter from Mr. <HI>Trip,</HI> which I put with|in the leaves, and read about <HI>ab&s;ence</HI> and <HI>in|con&s;olablene&s;s,</HI> and <HI>ardour,</HI> and <HI>irre&s;i&s;tible pa&s;|&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>eternal con&s;tancy,</HI> while my aunt

<P>DEAR &s;oul! how old people that think them&s;elves wi&s;e may be impo&s;ed upon! But it is fit that they &s;hould take their turn, for I am &s;ure, while they can keep poor girls clo&s;e in the nur&s;ery, they tyranni&s;e over our under|&s;tanding in a very &s;hameful manner, and fill our imaginations with tales of terror, only to make us live in quiet &s;ubjection, and fan&s;y that we can never be fa&s;e but by their pro|tection.</P>
<P>I HAVE a mamma and two aunts, who have all been formerly celebrated for wit and beauty, and are &s;till generally admired by tho&s;e that value them&s;elves upon their under&s;tand|ing, and love to talk of vice and virtue, na|ture and &s;implicity, and beauty, and proprie|ty; but if there was not &s;ome hope of meeting me, &s;carcely a creature would come near them that wears a fa&s;hionable coat. The&s;e ladies, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> have had me under their go|vernment
<PB N="147" REF="148">
fifteen years and a half, and have all that time been endeavouring to deceive me by &s;uch repre&s;entations of life as I cannot yet find to be true, but which I knew not whether I ought to impute to ignorance or malice, as it is po&s;&s;ible the world may be much changed &s;ince they mingled in general conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>BEING de&s;irous that I &s;hould love books, they told me, that nothing but knowledge could make me an agreeable companion to men of &s;en&s;e, or qualify me to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;uperficial glitter of vanity from the &s;olid me|rit of under&s;tanding; and that a habit of reading would enable me to fill up the vacui|ties of life without the help of trivial or dan|gerous amu&s;ements, and pre&s;erve me from the &s;nares of idlene&s;s and the inroads of temp|tation.</P>
<P>BUT their principal intention &s;eems to have been to make me afraid of men, in which they &s;ucceeded &s;o well for a time, that I dur&s;t not look in their faces, or be left alone with them in a parlour; for they made me fan&s;y, that no man ever &s;poke but to deceive, or looked but to allure; that the
<PB N="148" REF="149">
girl who &s;uffered him that had once &s;queezed her hand, to approach her a &s;econd time was on the brink of ruin; and that &s;he who an|&s;wered a billet, without con&s;ulting her rela|tions, gave love &s;uch power over her, that &s;he would certainly become either poor or in|famous.</P>
<P>FROM the time that my leading-&s;trings were taken off, I &s;carce heard any mention of my beauty but from the milliner, the man|tua-maker, and my own maid; for my mam|ma never &s;aid more when &s;he heard me com|mended, but "The girl is very well," and then endeavoured to divert my attention by &s;ome enquiry after my needle, or my book.</P>
<P>IT is now three months &s;ince I have been &s;uffered to pay and receive vi&s;its, to dance at publick a&s;&s;emblies, to have a place kept for me in the boxes, and to play at lady <HI>Racket</HI>'s rout; and you may ea&s;ily imagine what I think of tho&s;e who have &s;o long cheat|ed me with fal&s;e expectations, di&s;turbed me with &s;ictitious terrors, and concealed from me all that I have found to make the happine&s;s of woman.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="150">
I AM &s;o far from perceiving the u&s;efulne&s;s or nece&s;&s;ity of books, that if I had not dropped all preten&s;ions to learning I &s;hould have lo&s;t Mr. <HI>Trip,</HI> whom I once frighted into an|other box, by retailing &s;ome of <HI>Dryden</HI>'s re|marks upon a tragedy; for Mr. <HI>Trip</HI> declares that he hates nothing like hard words, and I am &s;ure, there is not a better partner to be found; his very walk is a dance. I have talked once or twice among ladies about prin|ciples and ideas, but they put their fans before their faces, and told me, I was too wi&s;e for them, who for their part, never pretended to read any thing but the play-bill, and then a&s;ked me the price of my be&s;t head.</P>
<P>THOSE vacancies of time which are to be filled up with books, I have never yet obtain|ed; for, con&s;ider, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> I go to bed late, and therefore cannot ri&s;e early; as &s;oon as I am up, I dre&s;s for the gardens; then walk in the park; then always go to &s;ome &s;ale or &s;how, or entertainment at the little theatre; then mu&s;t be dre&s;&s;ed for dinner; then mu&s;t pay my vi&s;its; then walk in the park; then hurry to the play; and from thence to the card-table. This is the general cour&s;e of
<PB N="150" REF="151">
the day when there happens nothing extraor|dinary; but &s;ometimes I ramble into the coun|try and come back again to a ball; &s;ometimes I am engaged for a whole day and part of the night. If, at any time, I can gain an hour by not being at home, I have &s;o many things to do, &s;o many orders to give to the milliner, &s;o many alterations to make in my cloaths, &s;o many vi&s;itants names to read over, &s;o many invitations to accept or refu&s;e, &s;o many cards to write, and &s;o many fa&s;hions to con&s;ider, that I am lo&s;t in confu&s;ion, forced at la&s;t to let in company or &s;tep into my chair, and leave half my affairs to the direction of my maid.</P>
<P>THIS is the round of my day; and when &s;hall I either &s;top my cour&s;e, or &s;o change it as to want a book? I &s;uppo&s;e it cannot be imagined that any of the&s;e diver&s;ions will be &s;oon at an end, There will always be gar|dens, and a park, and auctions, and &s;hows, and playhou&s;es, and cards; vi&s;its will always be paid, and cloaths always be worn; and how can I have time unemployed upon my hands.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="152">
BUT I am mo&s;t at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s for what purpo&s;e they related &s;uch tragick &s;tories of the cruelty, perfidy, and artifices of men, who, if they ever were &s;o malicious and de&s;tructive, have certainly now reformed their manners. I have not &s;ince my entrance into the world found one who does not profe&s;s him&s;elf de|voted to my &s;ervice, and ready to live or die as I &s;hall command him. They are &s;o far from intending to hurt me, that their only contention is, who &s;hall be allowed mo&s;t clo&s;e|ly to attend, and mo&s;t frequently to treat me; when different places of entertainment or &s;chemes of plea&s;ure are mentioned, I can &s;ee the eyes &s;parkle and the cheeks glow of him who&s;e propo&s;als obtain my approbation; he then leads me off in triumph, adores my con|de&s;cention, and congratulates him&s;elf that he has lived to the hour of felicity. Are the&s;e, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> creatures to be &s;eared? Is it likely that any injury will be done me by tho&s;e who can enjoy life only while I favour them with my pre&s;ence?</P>
<P>AS little rea&s;on can I yet find to &s;u&s;pect them of &s;tratagems and fraud. When I play at cards, they never take advantage of my
<PB N="152" REF="153">
mi&s;takes, nor exact from me a rigorous ob&s;er|vation of the laws of the game. Even Mr. <HI>Shuffle,</HI> a grave gentleman, who has daugh|ters older than my&s;elf, plays with me &s;o neg|ligently, that I am &s;ometimes inclined to be|lieve he lo&s;es his money by de&s;ign, and yet he is &s;o fond of play, that he &s;ays, he will one day take me to his hou&s;e in the country; that we may try by our&s;elves who can conquer. I have not yet promi&s;ed him, but when the town grows a little empty, I &s;hall think upon it, for I want &s;ome trinkets, like <HI>Letitia</HI>'s, to my watch. I do not doubt my luck, but mu&s;t &s;tudy &s;ome means of amu&s;ing my re|lations.</P>
<P>FOR all the&s;e di&s;tinctions I find my&s;elf in|debted to that beauty which I was never &s;uf|fered to hear prai&s;ed, and of which therefore, I did not before know the full value. This concealment was certainly an intentional fraud, for my aunts have eyes like other people, and I am every day told, that no|thing but blindne&s;s can e&s;cape the influence of my charms.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM the &s;on of a gentleman, who&s;e an|ce&s;tors, for many ages, held the fir&s;t rank in the county; till at la&s;t one of them, too
<PB N="154" REF="155">
de&s;irous of popularity, &s;et his hou&s;e open to all that would enter it, kept a table covered with continual profu&s;ion, and di&s;tributed his beef and ale to &s;uch as cho&s;e rather to live upon the folly of others than their own la|bour with &s;uch thoughtle&s;s liberality, that he left a third part of his e&s;tate mortgaged. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or a man of &s;pirit, &s;corned to impair his dignity by par&s;imonious retrenchments, or to admit by a &s;ale of his lands any participa|tion of the rights of his manor; he therefore made another mortgage to pay the intere&s;t of the former, and plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the re|flection, that his &s;on would have the heredi|tary e&s;tate without the diminution of an acre.</P>
<P>NEARLY re&s;embling this, was the prac|tice of my wi&s;e progenitors for many ages. Every man boa&s;ted the antiquity of his fa|mily, re&s;olved to &s;upport the dignity of his birth, and lived in &s;plendor and plenty at the expence of his heir, who, &s;ometimes by a wealthy marriage, and &s;ometimes by lucky legacies, di&s;charged part of the incumbrances, and thought him&s;elf entitled to contract new debts, and to leave to his children the &s;ame inheritance of embarra&s;ment and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="156">
THUS the e&s;tate perpetually decayed; the woods were felled by one, the park ploughed by another, the fi&s;hery let to farmers by a third; at la&s;t the old hall was pulled down to &s;pare the co&s;t of reparation, and part of the materials &s;old to build a &s;mall hou&s;e with the re&s;t. We were now openly degraded from our original rank, and my father's brother was allowed with le&s;s reluctance to &s;erve an ap|prentice&s;hip, though we never reconciled our|&s;elves heartily to the &s;ound of haberda&s;her, but always talked of warehou&s;es and a mer|chant, and when the wind happened to blow loud affected to pity the hazards of com|merce, and to &s;ympathize with the &s;olicitude of my poor uncle, who had the true retailer's terror of adventure, and never expo&s;ed him|&s;elf or his property to any wider water than the <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>IN time, however, by continual profit and &s;mall expences he grew rich, and began to turn his thoughts towards rank. He hung the arms of the family over his parlour-chim|ney; pointed at a chariot decorated only with a cypher; became of opinion that money could not make a gentleman; re&s;ented the
<PB N="156" REF="157">
petulance of up&s;tarts; told &s;tories of alder|man <HI>Puff</HI>'s grandfather the porter; wonder|ed that there was no better method for regu|lating precedence; wi&s;hed for &s;ome dre&s;s pe|culiar to men of fa&s;hion; and when his &s;er|vant pre&s;ented a letter, always enquired whe|ther it came from his brother the e&s;quire.</P>
<P>MY father was careful to &s;end him game by every carrier, which, though the convey|ance often co&s;t more than the value, was well received, becau&s;e it gave him an opportunity of calling his friends together, de&s;cribing the beauty of his brother's &s;eat, and lamenting his own folly, whom no remon&s;trances could with-hold from polluting his fingers with a &s;hop-book.</P>
<P>THE little pre&s;ents which we &s;ent were al|ways returned with great munificence. He was de&s;irous of being the &s;econd founder of his family, and could not bear that we &s;hould be any longer out&s;hone by tho&s;e whom we con&s;idered as climbers upon our ruins, and u&s;urpers of our fortune. He furni&s;hed our hou&s;e with all the elegance of fa&s;hionable expence, and was careful to conceal his boun|ties,
<PB N="157" REF="158">
le&s;t the poverty of his family &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>AT length it happened that by mi&s;conduct like our own, a large e&s;tate, which had been purcha&s;ed from us, was again expo&s;ed to the be&s;t bidder. My uncle delighted with an op|portunity of rein&s;tating the family in their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, came down with trea&s;ures &s;carcely to be imagined in a place where commerce has not made large &s;ums familiar, and at once drove all the competitors away, expedited the writings, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He now con|&s;idered him&s;elf as &s;uperior to trade, di&s;po&s;ed of his &s;tock, and as &s;oon as he had &s;ettled his oeconomy, began to &s;how his rural &s;overeign|ty, by breaking the hedges of his tenants in hunting, and &s;eizing the guns or nets of tho&s;e who&s;e fortunes did not qualify them for &s;port&s;men. He &s;oon afterwards &s;olicited the office of &s;heriff, from which all his neigh|bours were glad to be reprieved, but which he regarded as a re&s;umption of ance&s;tral claims, and a kind of re&s;toration to blood after the attainder of a trade.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159">
MY uncle, who&s;e mind was &s;o filled with this change of his condition, that he found no want of dome&s;tick entertainment, de|clared him&s;elf too old to marry, and re&s;olved to let the newly purcha&s;ed e&s;tate fall into the regular channel of inheritance. I was there|fore con&s;idered as heir apparent, and courted with officiou&s;ne&s;s and care&s;&s;es, by the gentle|men who had hitherto coldly allowed me that rank which they could not refu&s;e, depre&s;&s;ed me with &s;tudied neglect, and irritated me with ambiguous in&s;ults.</P>
<P>I FELT not much plea&s;ure from the civi|lities for which I knew my&s;elf indebted to my uncle's indu&s;try, till by one of the invi|tations which every day now brought me, I was induced to &s;pend a week with <HI>Lucius,</HI> who&s;e daughter <HI>Flavilla</HI> I had often &s;een, and admired like others, without any thought of nearer approaches. The inequality which had hitherto kept me at a di&s;tance being now levelled, I was received with every evidence of re&s;pect; <HI>Lucius</HI> told me the fortune which he intended for his favourite, his lady detailed her virtues, many odd accidents obliged us to be often together without company, and I
<PB N="159" REF="160">
&s;oon began to find that they were &s;preading for me the nets of matrimony.</P>
<P><HI>FLAVILLA</HI> was all &s;oftne&s;s and com|plai&s;ance. I who had been excluded by a nar|row fortune from much acquaintance with the world, and never been honoured before with the notice of &s;o fine a lady, was ea&s;ily ena|moured. <HI>Lucius</HI> either perceived my pa&s;&s;ion, or <HI>Flavilla</HI> betrayed it; care was taken that our private meetings &s;hould be le&s;s frequent, and my charmer confe&s;&s;ed by her eyes how much pain &s;he &s;uffered from our re&s;traint. I renewed my vi&s;it upon every pretence, but was not allowed one interview without wit|ne&s;s, at la&s;t I declared my pa&s;&s;ion to <HI>Lucius,</HI> who received me as a lover worthy of his daughter, and told me that nothing was want|ing to his con&s;ent, but that my uncle &s;hould &s;ettle his e&s;tate upon me. I objected the in|decency of encroaching on his life, and the danger of provoking him by &s;uch an un&s;ea|&s;onable demand. <HI>Lucius</HI> &s;eemed not to think decency of much importance, but admitted the danger of di&s;plea&s;ing, and concluded that as he was now old, and &s;ickly, we might without any inconvenience wait for his death.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161">
WITH this re&s;olution I was better con|tented, as it procured me the company of <HI>Flavilla,</HI> in which the days pa&s;&s;ed away amid&s;t continual rapture; but in time, I be|gan to be a&s;hamed of &s;itting idle, in expecta|tion of growing rich by the death of my benefactor, and propo&s;ed to <HI>Lucius</HI> many &s;chemes of rai&s;ing my own fortune by &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as I knew my uncle willing to give me. <HI>Lucius</HI> afraid le&s;t I &s;hould change my affection in ab&s;ence, diverted me from my de|&s;ign by di&s;&s;ua&s;ives to which my pa&s;&s;ion ea&s;ily li&s;tened. At la&s;t my uncle died, and con&s;i|dering him&s;elf as neglected by me, from the time that <HI>Flavilla</HI> took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart, left his e&s;tate to my younger brother, who was always hovering about his bed, and re|lating &s;tories of my pranks and extravagance, my contempt of the commercial dialect, and my impatience to be &s;elling &s;tock.</P>
<P>MY condition was &s;oon known, and I was no longer admitted by the father of <HI>Flavilla.</HI> I repeated the prote&s;tations of regard, which had been formerly returned with &s;o much ar|dour, in a letter which &s;he received privately, but returned by her father's footman. Con|tempt

<P>WHATEVER is univer&s;ally de&s;ired, will be &s;ought by indu&s;try and arti|fice, by merit and crimes, by means good and bad, rational and ab&s;urd, according to the prevalence of virtue or vice, of wi&s;dom or
<PB N="162" REF="163">
folly. Some will always mi&s;take the degree of their own de&s;ert, and &s;ome will de&s;ire that others may mi&s;take it. The cunning will have recour&s;e to &s;tratagem, and the powerful to violence for the attainment of their wi&s;hes; &s;ome will &s;toop to theft, and others venture upon plunder.</P>
<P>PRAISE is &s;o plea&s;ing to the mind of man, that it is the original motive of almo&s;t all our actions. The de&s;ire of commendation, as of every thing el&s;e, is varied indeed by innumera|ble differences of temper, capacity, and know|ledge; &s;ome have no higher wi&s;h than for the applau&s;e of a club; &s;ome expect the ac|clamations of a county; and &s;ome have hoped to fill the mouths of all ages and na|tions with their names. Every man pants for the highe&s;t eminence within his view; none, however mean, ever &s;inks below the hope of being di&s;tingui&s;hed by his fellow-beings, and very few have, by magnanimity or piety, been &s;o rai&s;ed above it, as to act wholly with|out regard to human cen&s;ure or opinion.</P>
<P>TO be prai&s;ed, therefore, every man re|&s;olves, but re&s;olutions will not execute them|&s;elves.
<PB N="163" REF="164">
That which all think too par&s;imoni|ou&s;ly di&s;tributed to their own claims, they will not gratuitou&s;ly &s;quander upon others, and &s;ome expedient mu&s;t be tried by which prai&s;e may be gained before it can be en|joyed.</P>
<P>AMONG the innumerable bidders for prai&s;e &s;ome are willing to purcha&s;e at the highe&s;t rate, and offer ea&s;e and health, fortune and life. Yet even of the&s;e only a &s;mall part have gained what they &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired; the &s;tudent wa&s;tes away in meditation, and the &s;oldier peri&s;hes on the ramparts, but unle&s;s &s;ome accidental advantage co-operates with merit, neither per&s;everance nor adventure at|tract the attention of mankind, and learning and bravery &s;ink into the grave without ho|nour or remembrance.</P>
<P>BUT ambition and vanity generally expect to be gratified on ea&s;ier terms. It has been long ob&s;erved, that what is procured by &s;kill or labour to the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, may be after|wards transferred for money; and that the man of wealth may partake all the acqui&s;i|tions of courage without hazard, and all the
<PB N="164" REF="165">
products of indu&s;try without fatigue. It was ea&s;ily di&s;covered, that riches would obtain prai&s;e among other conveniencies, and that he who&s;e pride was unluckily a&s;&s;ociated with lazine&s;s, ignorance, or cowardice, needed only to pay the hire of a panegyri&s;t, and he might be regaled with periodical eulogies; might determine, at lei&s;ure, what virtue or &s;cience he would be plea&s;ed to appropriate, and be lulled in the evening with &s;oothing fe|renades, or waked in the morning by &s;pright|ly gratulations.</P>
<P>THE happine&s;s which mortals receive from the celebration of beneficence which never re|lieved, or eloquence which never per&s;uaded, dignity which never awed, or elegance which never plea&s;ed, ought not to be envied or di|&s;turbed, when they are known hone&s;tly to pay for their entertainment. But there are un|merciful exactors of adulation, who with-hold the wages of venality; retain their encomia&s;t from year to year by general promi&s;es and am|biguous blandi&s;hments; and when he has run through the whole compa&s;s of flattery di&s;mi&s;s him with contempt, becau&s;e his vein of fic|tion is exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166">
A CONTINUAL fea&s;t of commendation is only to be obtained by merit or by wealth; many are therefore obliged to content them|&s;elves with &s;ingle mor&s;els, and recompen&s;e the infrequency of their enjoyment by exce&s;s and riot, whenever fortune &s;ets the banquet be|fore them. Hunger is never delicate; they who are &s;eldom gorged to the full with prai&s;e, may be &s;afely fed with gro&s;s compliments, for the appetite mu&s;t be &s;atisfied before it is di&s;gu&s;ted.</P>
<P>IT is generally ea&s;y to find the moment at which vanity is eager for &s;u&s;tenance, and all that impudence or &s;ervility can offer will be well received. When any one com|plains of the want of what he is known to po&s;&s;e&s;s in an uncommon degree, he certainly waits with impatience to be contradicted. When the trader pretends anxiety about the payment of his bills, or the beauty remarks how frightfully &s;he looks, then is the lucky moment to talk of riches or of charms, of the death of lovers, or the honour of a merchant.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="167">
OTHERS there are yet more open and artle&s;s, who in&s;tead of &s;uborning a flatterer are content to &s;upply his place, and, as &s;ome animals impregnate them&s;elves, &s;well with the prai&s;es which they hear from their own tongues. <HI>Recte is dicitur laudare &s;e&s;e cui nemo alius contigit laudator.</HI> "It is right, &s;ays <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> that he, whom no one el&s;e will commend, &s;hould be&s;tow commendations on him&s;elf." Of all the &s;ons of vanity, the&s;e are &s;ure the happie&s;t and greate&s;t; for what is greatne&s;s or happine&s;s but indepen|dence on external influences, exemption from hope or fear, and the power of &s;upplying every want from the common &s;tores of na|ture which can neither be exhau&s;ted nor pro|hibited. Such is the wi&s;e man of the &s;toicks; &s;uch is the divinity of the epicureans; and &s;uch is the flatterer of him&s;elf. Every other enjoyment malice may de&s;troy; every other panegyrick envy may with-hold; but no hu|man power can deprive the boa&s;ter of his own encomiums. Infamy may hi&s;s, or contempt may growl, the hirelings of the great may &s;ol|low fortune, and the votaries of truth may at|tend on virtue; but his plea&s;ures &s;till remain the &s;ame; he can always li&s;ten with rapture to
<PB N="167" REF="168">
him&s;elf, and leave tho&s;e who dare not repo&s;e upon their own atte&s;tation, to be elated or depre&s;&s;ed by chance, and toil on in the hope|le&s;s ta&s;k of fixing caprice, and propitiating malice.</P>
<P>THIS art of happine&s;s has been long prac|ti&s;ed by periodical writers, with little apparent violation of decency. When we think our excellencies overlooked by the world, or de|&s;ire to recall the attention of the publick to &s;ome particular performance, we &s;it down with great compo&s;ure and write a letter to our&s;elves. The corre&s;pondent who&s;e charac|ter we a&s;&s;ume always addre&s;&s;es us with the deference due to a &s;uperior intelligence; pro|po&s;es his doubts with a proper &s;en&s;e of his own inability; offers an objection with trem|bling diffidence; and at la&s;t has no other pre|ten&s;ions to our notice than his profundity of re|&s;pect, and &s;incerity of admiration, his &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to our dictates, and zeal for our &s;ucce&s;s. To &s;uch a reader it is impo&s;&s;ible to refu&s;e re|gard, nor can it ea&s;ily be imagined with how much alacrity we &s;natch up the pen which in|dignation or de&s;pair had condemned to inacti|vity,

<P>A LETTER of this kind I had lately the honour of peru&s;ing, in which, though &s;ome of the periods were negligently clo&s;ed, and &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of familiarity were u&s;ed, which I thought might teach others to addre&s;s me with too little reverence, I was &s;o much delighted with the pa&s;&s;ages in which mention was made of&mdash;univer&s;al learning&mdash;unbound|ed genius&mdash;&s;oul of <HI>Homer, Pythagoras,</HI> and <HI>Plato</HI>&mdash;&s;olidity of thought&mdash;accuracy of di|&s;tinction&mdash;elegance of combination&mdash;vigour of fancy&mdash;&s;trength of rea&s;on&mdash;and regula|rity of compo&s;ition&mdash;that I had once deter|mined to lay it before the publick. Three times I &s;ent it to the printer, and three times I fetched it back. My mode&s;ty, with which I had hitherto contended, was on the point of yielding, when reflecting that I was about to wa&s;te panegyricks on my&s;elf which might be more profitably re&s;erved for my patron, I locked it up for a better hour, in compliance with the farmer's principle, who never eats at home what he can carry to the market.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT vanity which keeps every man important in his own eyes, inclines me to believe, that neither you nor your rea|ders have yet forgotten the name of <HI>Eumathes,</HI> who &s;ent you a few months ago an account of his arrival at <HI>London</HI> with a young nobleman his pupil. I &s;hall therefore continue my nar|rative without preface or recapitulation.</P>
<P>MY pupil, in a very &s;hort time, by his mother's countenance and direction, ac|compli&s;hed him&s;elf with all tho&s;e qualifica|tions which con&s;titute puerile politene&s;s. He became in a few days a perfect ma&s;ter of his hat, which with a carele&s;s nicety, he could put off or on without any need to adju&s;t it
<PB N="170" REF="171">
by a &s;econd motion. This was not attained but by frequent con&s;ultations with his dan|cing-ma&s;ter, and con&s;tant practice before the gla&s;s, for he had &s;ome ru&s;tick habits to over|come; but what will not time and indu&s;try perform? A fortnight more furni&s;hed him with all the airs and forms of familiar and re|&s;pectful &s;alutation, from the clap on the &s;houl|der to the humble bow; he practi&s;es the &s;tare of &s;trangene&s;s, and the &s;mile of conde&s;cen|&s;ion, the &s;olemnity of promi&s;e, and the gra|ciou&s;ne&s;s of encouragement, as if he had been nur&s;ed at a levee; and pronounces, with no le&s;s propriety than his father, the mono&s;ylla|bles of coldne&s;s, and &s;onorous periods of re|&s;pectful profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>HE immediately lo&s;t the re&s;erve and timi|dity which &s;olitude and &s;tudy are apt to im|pre&s;s upon the mo&s;t courtly genius; was able to enter a crouded room with airy civility; to meet the glances of a hundred eyes with|out perturbation; and addre&s;s tho&s;e whom he never &s;aw before with ea&s;e and confidence. In le&s;s than a month, his mother declared her &s;atisfaction at his proficiency by a triumphant
<PB N="171" REF="172">
ob&s;ervation, that &s;he believed, <HI>nothing would make him blu&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ilence with which I was contented to hear my pupil's prai&s;es, gave the lady rea|&s;on to &s;u&s;pect me not much delighted with his acqui&s;itions; but &s;he attributed my di&s;|content to the diminution of my influence, and my fears of lo&s;ing the patronage of the family; and though &s;he thinks favourably of my learning and morals, &s;he con&s;iders me as wholly unacquainted with the cu&s;toms of the polite part of mankind, and therefore not qualified to form the manners of a young no|bleman, or communicate the knowledge of the world. This knowledge &s;he compri&s;es in the rules of vi&s;iting, the hi&s;tory of the pre|&s;ent hour, an early intelligence of the change of fa&s;hions, an exten&s;ive acquaintance with the names and faces of per&s;ons of rank, and a frequent appearance in places of re&s;ort.</P>
<P>ALL this my pupil per&s;ues with great ap|plication. He is twice a day in the mall, where he &s;tudies the dre&s;s of every man &s;plen|did enough to attract his notice, and never comes home without &s;ome ob&s;ervation upon
<PB N="172" REF="173">
&s;leeves, button-holes, and embroidery. At his return from the theatre, he can give an account of the gallantries, glances, whi&s;pers, &s;miles, &s;ighs, flirts, and blu&s;hes of every box, &s;o much to his mother's &s;atisfaction, that when I attempted to re&s;ume my character, by enquiring his opinion of the &s;entiments and diction of the tragedy, &s;he at once repre&s;&s;ed my critici&s;m, by telling me, that <HI>&s;he hoped he did not go to lo&s;e his time in attending to the crea|tures on the &s;tage.</HI></P>
<P>BUT his acutene&s;s was mo&s;t eminently &s;ig|nalized at the ma&s;querade, where he di&s;co|vered his acquaintance through their di&s;gui&s;es, with &s;uch wonderful facility, as has afforded the family an inexhau&s;tible topick of conver|&s;ation. Every new vi&s;itor is informed how one was detected by his gait, and another by the &s;wing of his arms, a third by the to&s;s of his head, and another by his favourite phra&s;e; nor can you doubt but the&s;e performances re|ceive their ju&s;t applau&s;e, and a genius thus ha&s;tening to maturity, is promoted by every art of cultivation.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174">
SUCH have been his endeavours, and &s;uch his a&s;&s;i&s;tances, that every trace of literature was &s;oon obliterated. He has changed his language with his dre&s;s, and in&s;tead of en|deavouring at purity or propriety, has no other care than to catch the reigning phra&s;e and current exclamation, till by copying whatever is peculiar in the talk of all who&s;e birth or fortune entitle them to imitation, he has collected every fa&s;hionable barbari&s;m of the pre&s;ent winter, and &s;peaks a dialect not to be under&s;tood among tho&s;e who form their &s;tile by poring upon authors.</P>
<P>TO this copiou&s;ne&s;s of ideas, and felicity of language, he has joined &s;uch eagerne&s;s to lead the conver&s;ation, that he is celebrated among the ladies as the prettie&s;t gentleman that the age can boa&s;t of, except that &s;ome who love to talk them&s;elves think him too forward, and others lament that with &s;o much wit and knowledge he is not taller.</P>
<P>HIS mother li&s;tens to his ob&s;ervations with her eyes &s;parkling and her heart beating, and can &s;carcely contain in the mo&s;t numerous a&s;&s;emblies the expectations which &s;he has
<PB N="174" REF="175">
formed of his future eminence. Women, by whatever fate; always judge ab&s;urdly of the intellects of boys. That vivacity and confi|dence which attract female admiration, are &s;eldom produced in the early part of life, but by ignorance at lea&s;t, if not by &s;tupidity; for they proceed not from confidence of right, but fearle&s;ne&s;s of wrong. Whoever has a clear apprehen&s;ion, mu&s;t have quick &s;en&s;ibi|lity, and where he has no &s;ufficient rea&s;on to tru&s;t his own judgment, will proceed with doubt and caution, becau&s;e he perpetually dreads the di&s;grace of error. The pain of mi&s;carriage is naturally proportionate to the defire of excellence, and, therefore, till men are hardened by long familiarity with re|proach, or have attained by frequent &s;trug|gles the art of concealing or &s;uppre&s;&s;ing their emotions, diffidence is found the in&s;eparable a&s;&s;ociate of under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>BUT &s;o little di&s;tru&s;t has my pupil of his own abilities, that he has for &s;ome time pro|fe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a wit, and tortures his imagina|tion all occa&s;ions for burle&s;que and jocularity. How he &s;upports a character, which, perhaps, no man ever a&s;&s;umed without repentance,
<PB N="175" REF="176">
may be ea&s;ily conjectured. Wit, you know, is the unexpected copulation of ideas, the di&s;|covery of &s;ome occult relation between images in appearance remote from each other; an ef|fu&s;ion of wit therefore pre&s;uppo&s;es an accu|mulation of knowledge; a memory &s;tored with notions, which the imagination may cull out to compo&s;e new a&s;&s;emblages. Whatever may be the native vigour of the mind, &s;he can never form many combinations from few ideas, as many changes can never be rung upon a few bells. Accident may indeed, &s;ometimes produce a luckly parallel or a &s;trik|ing contra&s;t; but the&s;e gifts of chance are not frequent, and he that has nothing of his own, and yet condemns him&s;elf to needle&s;s expences, mu&s;t live upon loans or theft.</P>
<P>THE indulgence which his youth has hi|therto obtained, and the re&s;pect which his rank &s;ecures, have hitherto &s;upplied the want of intellectual qualifications, and he imagines, that all admire who applaud, and that all who laugh are plea&s;ed. He therefore returns every day to the charge with encrea&s;e of courage, though not of &s;trength, and practi&s;es all the tricks by which wit is counterfeited. He lays
<PB N="176" REF="177">
trains for a quibble; he contrives blunders for his footman; he adapts old &s;tories to pre&s;ent characters; he mi&s;takes the que&s;tion, that he may return a &s;mart an&s;wer; he anticipates the argument, that he may plau&s;ibly object; when he has nothing to reply, he repeats the la&s;t words of his antagoni&s;t, then &s;ays, "your humble &s;ervant," and concludes with a laugh of triumph.</P>
<P>THESE mi&s;takes I have hone&s;tly attempted to correct, but what can be expected from rea&s;on un&s;upported by fa&s;hion, &s;plendour, or authority. He hears me indeed, or appears to hear me, but is &s;oon re&s;cued from the lec|ture by more plea&s;ing avocations; and &s;hows, diver&s;ions and care&s;&s;es drive my precepts from his remembrance.</P>
<P>HE at la&s;t imagines him&s;elf qualified to en|ter the world, and has met with adventures in his fir&s;t &s;ally, which I &s;hall by your paper communicate to the publick.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FAVOURS of every kind are doubled when they are &s;peedily conferred. This is particularly true of the gratification of curi|o&s;ity: He that long delays any &s;tory which he has promi&s;ed, and &s;uffers his auditor to tor|ment him&s;elf with expectation, will &s;eldom be able to recompen&s;e the unea&s;ine&s;s, or equal the hope which he &s;uffers to be rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on, I have already &s;ent you the continuation of my pupil's hi&s;tory, which, though it contains no events very uncommon, may be of u&s;e to other young men who are in too much ha&s;te to tru&s;t their own prudence,
<PB N="178" REF="179">
and quit the wing of protection before they are able to &s;hift for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>WHEN he fir&s;t &s;ettled in <HI>London,</HI> he was &s;o much bewildered in the enormous extent of the town, &s;o confounded by ince&s;&s;ant noi&s;e, and crowds, and hurry, and &s;o terrified by rural narratives of the arts of &s;harpers, the rudene&s;s of the populace, malignity of porters, and treachery of coachmen, that he was afraid to go beyond the door without an attendant, and imagined his life in danger if he was obliged to pa&s;s the &s;treets at night in any ve|hicle but his mother's chair.</P>
<P>HE was therefore contented for a time, that I &s;hould accompany him in all his excur&s;ions. But his fear abated as he grew more familiar with its objects, and the contempt to which his ru&s;ticity expo&s;ed him from &s;uch of his companions as had accidentally known the town longer, obliged him to di&s;&s;emble his re|maining terrors.</P>
<P>HIS de&s;ire of liberty made him now wil|ling to &s;pare me the trouble of ob&s;erving his motions, but knowing how much his igno|rance
<PB N="179" REF="180">
expo&s;ed him to mi&s;chief, I thought it cruel to abandon him to the fortune of the town. We went together every day to a coffee-hou&s;e, where he met wits, heirs, and fops, airy, ignorant, and thoughtle&s;s as him|&s;elf, with whom he had become acquainted at card tables, and whom he con&s;idered as the only beings to be envied or admired. What were their topics of conver&s;ation I could never di&s;cover, for &s;o much was their vivacity de|pre&s;&s;ed by my intru&s;ive &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, that they &s;eldom proceeded beyond the exchange of nods and &s;hrugs, an arch grin, or a broken hint, except when they could retire, while I was looking on the papers, to a corner of the room, where they &s;eemed to di&s;burden their imaginations, and commonly vented the &s;u|perfluity of their &s;prightline&s;s in a peal of laughter. When they had tittered them&s;elves into negligence, I could &s;ometimes overhear a few &s;yllables, &s;uch as,&mdash;&s;olemn ra&s;cal;&mdash;aca|demical airs;&mdash;&s;moke the tutor;&mdash;company for gentlemen!&mdash;and other broken phra&s;es, by which I did not &s;uffer my quiet to be di|&s;turbed, for they never proceeded to avowed indignities, but contented them&s;elves to mur|mur
<PB N="180" REF="181">
in &s;ecret, and, whenever I turned my eye upon them, &s;hrunk into &s;tilne&s;s.</P>
<P>HE was, however, de&s;irous of withdrawing from the &s;ubjection which he could not ven|ture to break, and made a &s;ecret appointment to a&s;&s;i&s;t his companions in the per&s;ecution of a play. His footman privately procured him a catcal, on which he practi&s;ed in a back|garret for two hours in the afternoon. At the proper time, a chair was called; he pre|tended an engagement at lady <HI>Flutter</HI>'s, and ha&s;tened to the place where his critical a&s;&s;o|ciates had a&s;&s;embled. They hurried away to the theatre, full of malignity and denuncia|tions again&s;t a man who&s;e name they had ne|ver heard, and a performance which they could not under&s;tand; for they were re&s;olved to judge for them&s;elves, and would not &s;uffer the town to be impo&s;ed upon by &s;cribblers. In the pit they exerted them&s;elves with great &s;pirit and vivacity; called out for the tunes of ob&s;cene &s;ongs, talked loudly at intervals of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> and <HI>John&s;on,</HI> played on their cat|cals a &s;hort prelude of terror, clamoured ve|hemently for the prologue, and clapped with
<PB N="181" REF="182">
great dexterity at the fir&s;t entrance of the players.</P>
<P>TWO &s;cenes they heard without attempting interruption, but being no longer able to re|&s;train their impatience, they then began to exert them&s;elves in groans and hi&s;&s;es, and plied their catcals with ince&s;&s;ant diligence; &s;o that they were &s;oon con&s;idered by the audience as di&s;turbers of the hou&s;e, and &s;ome who &s;at near them, either provoked at the ob&s;truction of their entertainment, or de&s;irous to pre&s;erve the author from the mortification of &s;eeing his hopes de&s;troyed by children, &s;natched away their in&s;truments of critici&s;m, and by the &s;ea|&s;onable vibration of a &s;tick, &s;ubdued them in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly to decency and &s;ilence.</P>
<P>TO exhilarate them&s;elves after this vexa|tious de&s;eat they po&s;ted to a tavern, where they recovered their alacrity, and, after two hours of ob&s;treperous jollity, bur&s;t out big with enterprize, and panting for &s;ome occa|&s;ion to &s;ignalize their prowe&s;s. They pro|ceeded vigorou&s;ly through two &s;treets, and with very little oppo&s;ition di&s;per&s;ed a rabble of drunkards le&s;s daring than them&s;elves, then
<PB N="182" REF="183">
rolled two watchmen in the kennel, and broke the windows of a tavern in which the fugi|tives took &s;helter. At la&s;t it was determined to march up to a row of chairs, and demoli&s;h them for &s;tanding on the pavement; the chair|men formed a line of battle, and blows were exchanged for a time with equal courage on both &s;ides. At la&s;t the a&s;&s;ailants were over|powered, and the chairmen when they knew their captives, brought them home by force.</P>
<P>THE young gentleman next morning hung his head, and was &s;o much a&s;hamed of his outrages and defeat, that perhaps he might have been checked in his fir&s;t follies, had not his mother, partly in pity of his dejection, and partly in approbation of his &s;pirit, re|lieved him from his perplexity, by paying the damages privately, and di&s;couraging all ani|madver&s;ion and reproof.</P>
<P>THIS indulgence could not wholly pre&s;erve him from the remembrance of his di&s;grace, nor at once re&s;tore his confidence and elation. He was for three days &s;ilent, mode&s;t, and compliant, and thought him&s;elf neither too wi&s;e for in&s;truction, nor too manly for re|&s;traint.
<PB N="183" REF="184">
But his levity overcame this &s;alutary &s;orrow; he began to talk with his former rap|tures of ma&s;querades, taverns and frolicks; blu&s;tered when his wig was not combed with exactne&s;s; and threatened de&s;truction to a taylor who had mi&s;taken his directions about the pocket.</P>
<P>I KNEW that he was now ri&s;ing again above controul, and that this inflation of &s;pi|rits would bur&s;t out into &s;ome mi&s;chievous ab&s;urdity. I therefore watched him with great attention, but one evening, having at|tended his mother at a vi&s;it, he withdrew him&s;elf, un&s;u&s;pected, while the company was engaged at cards. His vivacity and officiou&s;|ne&s;s were &s;oon mi&s;&s;ed, and his return impa|tiently expected; &s;upper was delayed, and conver&s;ation &s;u&s;pended; every coach that rat|tled through the &s;treet was expected to bring him, and every &s;ervant that entered the room was examined concerning his departure. At la&s;t the lady returned home, and was with great difficulty pre&s;erved from fits by &s;pirits and cordials. The family was di&s;patched a thou&s;and ways without &s;ucce&s;s, and the hou&s;e was filled with di&s;traction, till, as we were
<PB N="184" REF="185">
deliberating what farther mea&s;ures to take, he returned from a petty gaming-table, with his coat torn, and his head broken; without his &s;word, &s;nuff-box, &s;leeve-buttons, and watch.</P>
<P>OF this lo&s;s or robbery, he gave little ac|count; but, in&s;tead of &s;inking into his former &s;hame, endeavoured to &s;upport him&s;elf by &s;urline&s;s and a&s;perity, "He was not the fir&s;t that had played away a few trifles, and of what u&s;e were birth and fortune if they would not admit &s;ome &s;allies and ex|pences." His mamma was &s;o much pro|voked by the co&s;t of this prank, that &s;he would neither palliate nor conceal it, and his father, after &s;ome threats of ru&s;tication which his fondne&s;s would not &s;uffer him to execute, reduced the allowance of his pocket, that he might not be tempted by plenty to pro&s;u&s;ion. This method would have &s;ucceeded in a place where there are no pandars to folly and ex|travagance, but was now likely to have pro|duced pernicious con&s;equences; for we have di&s;covered a treaty with a broker, who&s;e daughter he &s;eems di&s;po&s;ed to marry, on con|dition that he &s;hall be &s;upplied with pre&s;ent
<PB N="185" REF="186">
money, for which he is to repay thrice the value at the death of his father.</P>
<P>THERE was now no time to be lo&s;t. A dome&s;tick con&s;ultation was immediately held, and he was doomed to pa&s;s two years in the country; but his mother, touched with his tears, declared, that &s;he thought him too much a man to be any longer confined to his book, and he therefore begins his travels to|morrow under a <HI>French</HI> governor.</P>

<P><HI>BAXTER,</HI> in the narrative of his own life, has enumerated &s;everal opinions, which, though he thought them evident and inconte&s;table at his fir&s;t entrance into the
<PB N="186" REF="187">
world, time and experience di&s;po&s;ed him to change.</P>
<P>WHOEVER reviews the &s;tate of his own mind from the dawn of manhood to its de|cline, and con&s;iders what he pur&s;ued or dread|ed, &s;lighted or e&s;teemed at different periods of his age, will have no rea&s;on to imagine &s;uch changes of &s;entiment peculiar to any &s;tation or character. Every man, however carele&s;s and inattentive, has conviction forced upon him; the lectures of time obtrude them&s;elves upon the mo&s;t unwilling or di&s;&s;ipated auditor; and by comparing our pa&s;t with our pre&s;ent thoughts, we perceive that we have changed our minds, though perhaps we cannot di&s;cover when the alteration happened, or by what cau&s;es it was produced.</P>
<P>THIS revolution of &s;entiments occa&s;ions a perpetual conte&s;t between the old and young. They who imagine them&s;elves entitled to ve|neration and obedience by the prerogative of longer life, are generally inclined to treat the notions of tho&s;e who&s;e conduct they &s;uperin|tend with &s;uperciliou&s;ne&s;s and contempt, for want of con&s;idering that the future and the
<PB N="187" REF="188">
pa&s;t have different appearances; that the di&s;|proportion will always be great between ex|pectation and enjoyment, between new po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion and &s;atiety; that the truth of many maxims of age, gives too little plea&s;ure to be allowed till it is felt; and that the mi&s;eries of life would be encrea&s;ed beyond all human power of endurance, if we were to enter the world with the &s;ame opinions as we carry from it.</P>
<P>WE naturally indulge tho&s;e ideas that plea&s;e us. Hope will predominate in every mind, till it has been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by frequent di&s;ap|pointments. The youth who has not di&s;co|vered how many evils are continually hovering about us, when he is &s;et free from the &s;hackles of di&s;cipline looks abroad into the world with rapture; he &s;ees an ely&s;ian region open before him, &s;o variegated with beauty, and &s;o &s;tored with plea&s;ure, that his care is rather to accu|mulate good, than to &s;hun evil; he &s;tands di|&s;tracted by different forms of delight, and has no other doubt than which path to follow of tho&s;e which all lead equally to the bowers of happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="189">
HE who has &s;een only the &s;uperficies of life believes every thing to be what it ap|pears, and rarely &s;u&s;pects that external &s;plen|dor conceals any latent &s;orrow or vexation. He never imagines that there may be greatne&s;s without &s;afety, affluence without content, jol|lity without friend&s;hip, and &s;olitude without peace.

He is inclined to believe no man mi&s;e|rable but by his own fault, and &s;eldom looks with much pity upon failings or mi&s;carriages, becau&s;e he thinks them willingly admitted or negligently incurred.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible without pity and contempt, to hear a youth of generous &s;entiments and warm imagination, declaring in the mo|ment of openne&s;s and confidence his de&s;igns and expectations. Becau&s;e long life is po&s;&s;i|ble, he con&s;iders it as certain, and therefore promi&s;es him&s;elf all the changes of happine&s;s, and provides gratifications for every de&s;ire. He is, for a time, to give him&s;elf wholly to frolick and diver&s;ion, to range the world in &s;earch of plea&s;ure, to delight every eye, to gain every heart, and to be celebrated equally for his
<PB N="189" REF="190">
plea&s;ing levities and &s;olid attainments, his deep reflections, and his &s;parkling repartees. He then elevates his views to nobler enjoyments, and finds all the &s;cattered excellencies of the female world united in a woman, who prefers his addre&s;&s;es to wealth and titles; he is after|wards to engage in bu&s;ine&s;s, to di&s;&s;ipate dif|ficulty, and over-power oppo&s;ition; to climb by the mere force of merit to fame and great|ne&s;s; and reward all tho&s;e who countenanced his ri&s;e, or paid due regard to his early excel|lence. At la&s;t he will retire in peace and ho|nour; contract his views to dome&s;tick plea|&s;ures; form the manners of children like him|&s;elf; ob&s;erve how every year expands the beauty of his daughters, and how his &s;ons catch ardour from their father's hi&s;tory; he will give laws to the neighbourhood; dictate axioms to po&s;terity; and leave the world an example of wi&s;dom and of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>WITH hopes like the&s;e, he &s;allies jocund into life; to little purpo&s;e is he told, that the condition of humanity admits no pure and unmingled happine&s;s; that the exuberant gaie|ty of youth ends in poverty or di&s;ea&s;e; that uncommon qualifications and contrarieties of
<PB N="190" REF="191">
excellence, produce envy equally with ap|plau&s;e; that whatever admiration and fond|ne&s;s may promi&s;e him, he mu&s;t marry a wife like the wives of others, with &s;ome virtues and &s;ome faults, and be as often di&s;gu&s;ted by her vices, as delighted by her elegance; that if he adventures into the circle of action, he mu&s;t expect to encounter men as artful, as daring, as re&s;olute as him&s;elf; that of his children, &s;ome may be deformed, and others vicious; &s;ome may di&s;grace him by their fol|lies, &s;ome offend him by their in&s;olence, and &s;ome exhau&s;t him by their profu&s;ion. He hears all this with ob&s;tinate incredulity, and wonders by what malignity old age is influ|enced, that it cannot forbear to fill his ears with predictions of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>AMONG other plea&s;ing errors of young minds, is the opinion of their own impor|tance. He that has not yet remarked, how little attention his contemporaries can &s;pare from their own affairs, conceives all eyes turned upon him&s;elf, and imagines every one that approaches him to be an enemy or a follower, an admirer or a &s;py. He there|fore lives in perpetual con&s;traint, and con&s;iders
<PB N="191" REF="192">
his fame as involved in the event of every action. Many of the virtues and vices of youth proceed from this quick &s;en&s;e of repu|tation. This it is that gives firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy, fidelity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and it is this that kindles re&s;entment for &s;light in|juries, and dictates all the principles of &s;an|guinary honour.</P>
<P>BUT as time brings him forward into the world, he &s;oon di&s;covers that he only &s;hares fame or reproach with innumerable partners; that he is left unmarked in the ob&s;curity of the croud; and that what he does, whether good or bad, though it may produce a &s;hort com|motion, &s;oon gives way to new objects of regard. He then ea&s;ily &s;ets him&s;elf free from the anxieties of reputation, and con&s;iders prai&s;e or cen&s;ure as a tran&s;ient breath, which, while he hears it, is pa&s;&s;ing away, without any la&s;ting mi&s;chief or advantage.</P>
<P>IN youth, it is common to mea&s;ure right and wrong by the opinion of the world, and in age to act without any mea&s;ure but inte|re&s;t, and to lo&s;e &s;hame without &s;ub&s;tituting virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="193">
SUCH is the condition of life, that &s;ome|thing is always wanting to happine&s;s. In youth we have warm hopes which are &s;oon bla&s;ted by ra&s;hne&s;s and negligence, and great de&s;igns which are defeated by inexperience. In age we have knowledge and prudence without &s;pirit to exert, or motives to prompt them; we are able to plan &s;chemes and re|gulate mea&s;ures, but have not time remaining to bring them to completion.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BELONG to an order of mankind, con|&s;iderable at lea&s;t for their number, to which your notice has never been formally ex|tended, though we &s;eem equally entitled to regard with tho&s;e triflers, who have &s;upplied
<PB N="193" REF="194">
you with topicks of amu&s;ement or in&s;truction. I am, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> a legacy-hunter; and as every man is willing to think well of the tribe in which his name is regi&s;tered, you will for|give my vanity if I remind you that the le|gacy-hunter, however degraded by an ill|compounded appellation in our barbarous language, was known, as I am told, in an|cient <HI>Rome,</HI> by the &s;onorous titles of <HI>Cap|tator</HI> and <HI>Haeredipeta.</HI></P>
<P>MY father was an attorney in the country, who married his ma&s;ter's daughter, in hopes of a fortune which he did not obtain, having been, as he afterwards di&s;covered, cho&s;en by her only becau&s;e &s;he had no better offer, and was afraid of &s;ervice. I was the fir&s;t offspring of a marriage thus reciprocally fraudulent, and therefore could not be expected to inherit much dignity or genero&s;ity, and if I had not from nature, was not likely ever to attain them; for in the years which I &s;pent at home I never heard any rea&s;on for action or for|bearance but that we &s;hould gain money or lo&s;e it, nor was taught any other &s;tile of com|mendation, than that Mr. <HI>Sneaker</HI> is a warm
<PB N="194" REF="195">
man, Mr. <HI>Gripe</HI> has done his bu&s;ine&s;s and needs care for no-body.</P>
<P>MY parents, though otherwi&s;e not great philo&s;ophers, knew the force of early educa|tion, and took care that the blank of my un|der&s;tanding &s;hould be filled with impre&s;&s;ions of the value of money. My mother, u&s;ed, upon all occa&s;ions, to inculcate &s;ome &s;alutary axioms, &s;uch as might incite me <HI>to keep what I had, and get what I could</HI>; &s;he informed me that we were in a world, where <HI>all mu&s;t catch that catch can</HI>; and as I grew up, &s;tored my memory with deeper ob&s;ervations; re&s;trained me from the u&s;ual puerile expences, by re|marking that <HI>many a little made a mickle</HI>; and, when I envied the finery of any of my neigh|bours, told me, that <HI>brag was a good dog, but holdfa&s;t was a better.</HI></P>
<P>I WAS &s;oon fagacious enough to di&s;cover that I was not born to great wealth, and, having heard no other name for happine&s;s, was &s;ometimes inclined to repine at my con|dition. But my mother always relieved me, by &s;aying, that there was money enough in the family, that <HI>it was good to be of kin to</HI>
<PB N="195" REF="196">
<HI>means,</HI> that I had nothing to do but to plea&s;e my friends and I might come to hold up my head with the be&s;t &s;quire in the country.</P>
<P>THESE &s;plendid expectations aro&s;e from our alliance to three per&s;ons of con&s;iderable fortune. My mother's aunt had attended on a lady, who, when &s;he died, rewarded her officiou&s;ne&s;s and fidelity with a large legacy. My father had two relations, of whom one had broken his indentures and ran to &s;ea, from whence after an ab&s;ence of thirty years, he returned with ten thou&s;and pounds; and the other had lured an heire&s;s out of a window, who dying of her fir&s;t child, had left him her e&s;tate, on which he lived without any other care than to collect his rents, and pre&s;erve from poachers that game which he could not kill him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THESE hoarders of money were vi&s;ited and courted by all who had any pretence to approach them, and received pre&s;ents and compliments from cou&s;ins who could &s;carcely tell the degree of their relation. But we had peculiar advantages which encouraged us to hope, that we &s;hould by degrees ea&s;ily &s;up|plant
<PB N="196" REF="197">
our competitors. My father, by his profe&s;&s;ion, made him&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary in their affairs; for the &s;ailor and the chambermaid, he enquired out mortgages and &s;ecurities, and wrote bonds and contracts; and had endeared him&s;elf to the old woman, who once ra&s;hly lent a hundred pounds without con&s;ulting him, by informing her, that her debtor was on the point of bankrupcy, and po&s;ting &s;o expedi|tiou&s;ly with an execution, that all the other creditors were defrauded.</P>
<P>TO the &s;quire he was a kind of &s;teward, and had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in his office by his addre&s;s in rai&s;ing the rents, his inflexibility in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the tardy tenants, and his acute|ne&s;s in fetting the pari&s;h free from burthen|&s;ome inhabitants, by &s;hifting them off to &s;ome other &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>BUSINESS made frequent attendance ne|ce&s;&s;ary; tru&s;t &s;oon produced intimacy; and &s;ucce&s;s gave a claim to kindne&s;s; &s;o that we had opportunity to practi&s;e all the arts of flat|tery and endearment. My mother, who could not &s;upport the thought of lo&s;ing any thing, determined, that all their fortunes &s;hould cen|ter
<PB N="197" REF="198">
in me; and in the pro&s;ecution of her &s;chemes took care to inform me that <HI>nothing co&s;ts le&s;s than good words,</HI> and that it is com|fortable to leap into an e&s;tate which another has got.</P>
<P>SHE trained me by the&s;e precepts to the utmo&s;t ductility of obedience, and the clo&s;e&s;t attention to profit. At an age when other boys are &s;porting in the fields, or murmuring in the &s;chool, I was contriving &s;ome new me|thod of paying my court; enquiring the age of my future benefactors; or con&s;idering how I &s;hould employ their legacies.</P>
<P>IF our eagerne&s;s of money could have been &s;atisfied with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of any one of my relations, they might perhaps have been ob|tained; but as it was impo&s;&s;ible to be always pre&s;ent with all three, our competitors were bu&s;y to efface any trace of affection which we might have left behind; and &s;ince there was not on any part &s;uch &s;uperiority of merit as could enforce a con&s;tant and un&s;haken preference, whoever was the la&s;t that flattered or obliged had for a time the a&s;cendant.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="199">
MY relations maintained a regular ex|change of courte&s;y, took care to mi&s;s no oc|ca&s;ion of condolence or congratulation, and &s;ent pre&s;ents at &s;tated times, but had in their hearts not much e&s;teem for one another. The &s;eaman looked with contempt upon the &s;quire as a milk&s;op and a landman, who had lived without knowing the points of the compa&s;s, or &s;eeing any part of the world beyond the county-town; and, whenever they met, would talk of longitude and latitude, and circles and tropicks, would &s;carcely tell him the hour without &s;ome mention of the horizon and meridian, nor &s;hew him the news without de|tecting his ignorance of the &s;ituation of other countries.</P>
<P>THE &s;quire con&s;idered the &s;ailor as a rude uncultivated &s;avage with little more of human than his form, and diverted him&s;elf with his ignorance of all common objects and affairs; when he could per&s;uade him to go into the field, he always expo&s;ed him to the &s;port&s;men, by &s;ending him to look for game in improper places; and once prevailed upon him to be pre&s;ent at the races, only that he might &s;how the gentlemen how a &s;ailor &s;at upon a hor&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="200">
THE old gentlewoman thought her&s;elf wi&s;er than both, for &s;he lived with no &s;ervant but a maid, and &s;aved her money. The others were indeed &s;ufficiently frugal, but the &s;quire could not live without dogs and hor&s;es, and the &s;ailor never &s;uffered the day to pa&s;s but over a bowl of punch, to which, as he was not critical in the choice of his compa|ny, every man was welcome that could roar out a catch, or tell a &s;tory.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e, however, I was to plea&s;e; an arduous ta&s;k, but what will not youth and avarice undertake? I had an unre&s;i&s;ting &s;up|plene&s;s of temper, and an in&s;atiable wi&s;h for riches; I was perpetually in&s;tigated by the ambition of my parents, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted occa&s;ion|ally by their in&s;tructions. What the&s;e advan|tages enabled me to perform, &s;hall be told in the next letter of,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU, who mu&s;t have ob&s;erved the in|clination which almo&s;t every man, how|ever unactive or in&s;ignificant, di&s;covers of re|pre&s;enting his life as di&s;tingui&s;hed by extraor|dinary events,-will not wonder that <HI>Captator</HI> thinks his narrative important enough to be continued. Nothing is more common than for the&s;e to tea&s;e their companions with their hi&s;tory, who have neither done nor &s;uffered any thing that can excite curio&s;ity, or afford in&s;truction.</P>
<P>AS I was taught to flatter with the fir&s;t e&s;|&s;ays of &s;peech, and had very early lo&s;t every other pa&s;&s;ion in the de&s;ire of money, I began my pur&s;uit with omens of &s;ucce&s;s; for <HI>I</HI> di|vided
<PB N="201" REF="202">
my officiou&s;ne&s;s &s;o judiciou&s;ly among my relations, that I was equally the favourite of all. When any of them entered the door, I went to welcome him with raptures, when he went away I hung down my head, and &s;ome|times entreated to go with him with &s;o much importunity, that I very narrowly e&s;caped a con&s;ent which I dreaded in my heart. When at an annual entertainment they were all to|gether I had a harder ta&s;k, but plied them &s;o impartially with care&s;&s;es, that none could charge me with neglect, and when they were wearied with my fondne&s;s and civilities, I was always di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with money to buy play|things.</P>
<P>LIFE cannot be kept at a &s;tand, the years of innocence and prattle were &s;oon at an end, and other qualifications were nece&s;&s;ary to re|commend me to continuance of kindne&s;s. It luckily happened, that none of my friends had high notions of book-learning. The &s;ailor hated to &s;ee tall boys &s;hut up in a &s;chool, when they might more properly be &s;eeing the world and making their fortunes; and was of opi|nion, that when the fir&s;t rules of arithmetick were known, all that was nece&s;&s;ary to make a
<PB N="202" REF="203">
man complete might be learned on &s;hip-board. The &s;quire only in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;o much &s;cholar|&s;hip was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, as might confer ability to draw a lea&s;e and read the court-hands; and the old chambermaid de|clared loudly her contempt of books, and her opinion that they only took the head off the main chance.</P>
<P>TO unite as well as we could all their &s;y|&s;tems, I was bred at home. Each was taught to believe, that I followed his directions, and I gained likewi&s;e, as my mother ob&s;erved, this advantage that I was always in the way, for &s;he had known many favourite children &s;ent to &s;chools or academies and forgotten.</P>
<P>AS I grew fitter to be tru&s;ted to my own di&s;cretion, I was often di&s;patched upon va|rious pretences to vi&s;it my relations, which di|rections from my parents how to ingratiate my&s;elf and drive away competitors.</P>
<P>I WAS, from my infancy, con&s;idered by the &s;ailor as a promi&s;ing genius, becau&s;e I liked punch better than wine; and I took care to improve this prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by continual enqui|ries
<PB N="203" REF="204">
about the art of navigation, the degree of heat and cold in different climates, the profits of trade, and the dangers of &s;hipwreck. I ad|mired the courage of the &s;eamen, and gained his heart by importuning him for a recital of his adventures; and a &s;ight of his foreign cu|rio&s;ities. I li&s;tened with an appearance of clo&s;e attention to &s;tories which I could already repeat, and at the clo&s;e never failed to expre&s;s my re&s;olution to vi&s;it di&s;tant countries, and my contempt of the cowards and drones that &s;pend all their lives in their native pari&s;h; though I had in reality no de&s;ire of any thing but money, nor ever felt the &s;timulations of curio&s;ity or ardour of adventure, but would contentedly have pa&s;&s;ed the years of <HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> in receiving rents, and lending upon mortgages.</P>
<P>THE &s;quire I was able to plea&s;e with le&s;s hypocri&s;y, for I really thought it plea&s;ant enough to kill the game and eat it. Some arts of fal&s;hood however the <HI>hunger of gold</HI> per&s;uaded me to practi&s;e, by which, though no other mi&s;chief was produced, the purity of my thoughts was vitiated, and the reverence for truth gradually de&s;troyed. I &s;ometimes purcha&s;ed fi&s;h and pretended to have caught
<PB N="204" REF="205">
them; I hired the countrymen to &s;how me partridges, and then gave my uncle intelli|gence of their haunt; I learned the &s;eats of hares at night, and di&s;covered them in the morning with &s;agacity that rai&s;ed the wonder and envy of old &s;port&s;men. One only ob|&s;truction to the advancement of my reputation I could never fully &s;urmount; I was naturally a coward, and was therefore always left &s;hamefully behind, when there was a nece&s;&s;ity to leap a hedge, to &s;wim a river, or force the hor&s;es to their utmo&s;t &s;peed; but as the&s;e exi|gencies did not frequently happen, I main|tained my honour with &s;ufficient &s;ucce&s;s, and was never left out of a hunting party.</P>
<P>THE old chambermaid was not &s;o certainly nor &s;o ea&s;ily plea&s;ed, for &s;he had no predomi|nant pa&s;&s;ion but avarice, and was therefore cold and inacce&s;&s;ible. She had no conception of any virtue in a young man but that of &s;aving his money. When &s;he heard of my exploits in the field, &s;he would &s;hake her head, and enquire how much I &s;hould be the richer for all my performances, and lament, that &s;o much &s;hould be &s;pent upon dogs and hor&s;es. If the &s;ailor told her of my inclina|tion
<PB N="205" REF="206">
to travel, &s;he was &s;ure there was no place like <HI>England,</HI> and could not imagine why any man that can live in his own country &s;hould leave it. This &s;ullen and frigid being I found means however to propitiate by frequent commendations of frugality, and perpetual care to avoid expence.</P>
<P>FROM the &s;ailor was our fir&s;t and mo&s;t con|&s;iderable expectation; for he was richer than the chambermaid, and older than the &s;quire. He was &s;o aukward and ba&s;hful among wo|men, that we concluded him &s;ecure from ma|trimony, and the noi&s;y fondne&s;s with which he u&s;ed to welcome me to his hou&s;e, made us imagine that he would look out for no other heir, and that we had nothing to do but wait patiently for his death. But in the mid&s;t of our triumph my uncle &s;aluted us one morning with a cry of tran&s;port, and clapping his hand hard on my &s;houlder, told me, I was a happy fellow to have a friend like him in the world, for he came to fit me out for a voyage with one of his old acquaintances. I turned pale and trembled; my father told him, that he believed my con&s;titution not fitted to the &s;ea; and my mother bur&s;ting into tears, cried out,
<PB N="206" REF="207">
that her heart would break if &s;he lo&s;t me. All this had no effect, the &s;ailor was wholly in|&s;u&s;ceptive of the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, and without regard to tears or arguments per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution to make me a man.</P>
<P>WE were obliged to comply in appear|ance, and preparations were accordingly made. I took leave of my friends, with great ala|crity, proclaimed the beneficence of my uncle with the highe&s;t &s;trains of gratitude; and re|joiced at the opportunity now put into my hands of gratifying my thir&s;t of knowledge. But a week before the day appointed for my departure, I fell &s;ick by my mother's direc|tion, and refu&s;ed all food but what &s;he pri|vately brought me; whenever my uncle vi|&s;ited me I was lethargick or delirious, but took care in my raving fits to talk ince&s;&s;antly of travel and merchandize. The room was kept dark; the table was filled with vials and gallipots; my mother was with difficulty per&s;uaded not to endanger her life with noc|turnal attendance; my father lamented the lo&s;s of the profits of the voyage; and &s;uch &s;uperfluity of artifice was employed, as per|haps might have di&s;covered the cheat to a man
<PB N="207" REF="208">
of penetration. But the &s;ailor unacquainted with &s;ubtilties and &s;tratagems was ea&s;ily de|luded, and as the &s;hip could not &s;tay for my recovery, &s;old the cargo, and left me to re|e&s;tabli&s;h my health at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>I WAS &s;ent to regain my fle&s;h in a purer air le&s;t it &s;hould appear never to have been wa&s;ted, and in two months returned to de|plore my di&s;appointment. My uncle pitied my dejection, and bid me prepare my&s;elf again&s;t next year, for no land-lubber &s;hould ever touch his money.</P>
<P>AREPRIEVE however was obtained, and perhaps &s;ome new &s;tratagem might have &s;uc|ceeded another &s;pring; but my uncle unhap|pily made amorous advances to my mother's maid, who to promote &s;o advantageous a match, di&s;covered the &s;ecret with which only &s;he had been entru&s;ted. He &s;tormed, and ra|ved, and declaring that he would have heirs of his own, and not give his &s;ub&s;tance to cheats and cowards, married the girl in two days, and has now four children.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="209">
COWARDICE is always &s;corned, and de|ceit univer&s;ally dete&s;ted. I found my friends, if not wholly alienated, at lea&s;t cooled in their affection; the &s;quire, though he did not whol|ly di&s;card me, was le&s;s fond, and often en|quired when I would go to &s;ea. I was obliged to bear his in&s;ults, and endeavoured to rekin|dle his kindne&s;s by a&s;&s;iduity and re&s;pect, but all my care was vain; he died without a will, and the e&s;tate devolved to the legal heir.</P>
<P>THUS has the folly of my parents con|demned me to &s;pend in flattery and attendance tho&s;e years in which I might have been quali|fied to place my&s;elf above hope or fear. I am arrived at manhood without any u&s;eful art or generous &s;entiment, and, if the old woman &s;hould likewi&s;e at la&s;t deceive me, am in dan|ger at once of beggary and ignorance.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH you have &s;eldom digre&s;&s;ed from moral &s;ubjects, I &s;uppo&s;e you are not &s;o rigorous or cynical as to deny the value or u&s;efulne&s;s of natural philo&s;ophy; or to have lived in this age of enquiry and experi|ment, without any attention to the wonders every day produced by the pokers of magne|ti&s;m and the wheels of electricity. At lea&s;t, I may be allowed to hope that &s;ince no|thing is more contrary to moral excellence than Envy, you will not refu&s;e to promote
<PB N="210" REF="211">
the happine&s;s of others, merely becau&s;e you cannot partake of their enjoyments.</P>
<P>IN confidence therefore that your igno|rance has not made you an enemy to know|ledge, I offer you the honour of introducing an adept to the notice of the publick; an adept, who having long laboured for the be|nefit of mankind is not willing, like too ma|ny of his predece&s;&s;ors, to conceal his &s;ecrets in the grave.</P>
<P>MANY have &s;ignalized them&s;elves by melt|ing their e&s;tates in crucibles. I was born to no fortune, and therefore had only my mind and body to devote to knowledge, and the gratitude of po&s;terity will atte&s;t, that neither mind nor body have been &s;pared. I have &s;at whole weeks without &s;leep by the &s;ide of an athanor, to watch the moment of projection; I have made the fir&s;t experiment in nineteen diving engines of new con&s;truction; I have fallen eleven times &s;peechle&s;s under the &s;hock of electricity; I have twice di&s;located my limbs, and once fractured my &s;kull in e&s;&s;ay|ing to fly; and four times endangered my life by &s;ubmitting to the transfu&s;ion of blood.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="212">
IN the fir&s;t period of my &s;tudies, I exerted the powers of my body more than tho&s;e of my mind, and was not without hopes that fame might be purcha&s;ed by a few broken bones without the toil of thinking; but having been &s;hattered by &s;ome violent experiments, and con&s;trained to confine my&s;elf to my books, I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ix and thirty years in &s;earching the trea&s;ures of ancient wi&s;dom, but am at la&s;t amply recompen&s;ed for all my per&s;everance.</P>
<P>THE curio&s;ity of the pre&s;ent race of phi|lo&s;ophers, after having been long exerci&s;ed upon electricity, has been lately transferred to Magneti&s;m; the qualities of the load&s;tone have been inve&s;tigated, if not with much ad|vantage, yet with great applau&s;e; and as the highe&s;t prai&s;e of art is to imitate nature, I hope no man will think the makers of arti|ficial magnets celebrated or reverenced above their de&s;erts.</P>
<P>I HAVE for &s;ome time employed my&s;elf in the &s;ame practice, but with deeper know|ledge and more exten&s;ive views. While my contemporaries were touching needles and rai&s;ing weights, or bu&s;ying them&s;elves with
<PB N="212" REF="213">
inclination and variation, I have been exa|mining tho&s;e qualities of magneti&s;m which may be applied to the accommodation and happine&s;s of common life. I have left to in|ferior Under&s;tandings the care of conducting the &s;ailor through the hazards of the ocean, and re&s;erved to my&s;elf the more difficult and illu&s;trious province of pre&s;erving the connu|bial compact from violation, and &s;etting man|kind free for ever from the danger of &s;uppo|&s;ititious children, and from the torments of fruitle&s;s vigilance and anxious &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>TO defraud any man of his due prai&s;e is unworthy of a philo&s;opher. I &s;hall therefore openly confe&s;s, that I owe the fir&s;t hint of this ine&s;timable &s;ecret to the rabbi <HI>Abraham Ben Hanna&s;e,</HI> who in his treati&s;e of precious &s;tones, has left this account of the magnet <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, &amp;c. "The calamita or load-&s;tone that attracts iron produces many bad fanta&s;ies in man. Women fly from this &s;tone. If therefore any hu&s;band be di|&s;turbed with jealou&s;y, and fear le&s;t his wife conver&s;es with other men, let him lay this &s;tone upon her while &s;he is a&s;leep. If &s;he be pure, &s;he will, when &s;he wakes, cla&s;p
<PB N="213" REF="214">
her hu&s;band fondly in her arms, but if &s;he be guilty, &s;he will fall out of bed and run away."</P>
<P>WHEN fir&s;t I read this wonderful pa&s;&s;age, I could not ea&s;ily conceive why it had remain|ed hitherto unregarded in &s;uch a zealous com|petition for magnetical fame. It would &s;urely be unju&s;t to &s;u&s;pect that any of the candidates are &s;trangers to the name or works of rabbi <HI>Abraham,</HI> or to conclude from a late edict of the royal &s;ociety in favour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lan|guage, that philo&s;ophy and literature are no longer to act in concert. Yet how &s;hould a quality &s;o u&s;eful, e&s;cape promulgation but by the ob&s;curity of the language in which it was delivered? Why are footmen, and chamber|maids paid on every &s;ide for keeping &s;ecrets, which no caution nor expence could &s;ecure from the all-penetrating magnet? Or why are &s;o many witne&s;&s;es &s;ummoned, and &s;o ma|ny artifices practi&s;ed to di&s;cover what &s;o ea&s;y an experiment would infallibly reveal?</P>
<P>FULL of this perplexity, I read the lines of <HI>Abraham</HI> to a friend, who advi&s;ed me not to expo&s;e my life by a mad indulgence of the
<PB N="214" REF="215">
love of fame; he warned me by the fate of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> what knowledge or genius could give no protection to the invader of female prerogatives; a&s;&s;ured me that neither the ar|mour of <HI>Achilles,</HI> nor the antidote of <HI>Mithri|dates,</HI> would be able to pre&s;erve me; and coun&s;elled me, if I could not live without renown, to attempt the acqui&s;ition of uni|ver&s;al empire, in which the honour would perhaps be equal, and the danger certainly be le&s;s.</P>
<P>I, a &s;olitary &s;tudent, pretend not to much knowledge of the world, but am unwilling to think it &s;o generally corrupt, as that a &s;cheme for the detection of incontinence, &s;hould bring any danger upon its inventor. My friend has indeed told me, that all the women will be my enemies, and that how|ever I flatter my&s;elf with hopes of defence from the men, I &s;hall certainly find my&s;elf de&s;erted in the hour of danger. Of the young men, &s;aid he, &s;ome will be afraid of &s;haring the di&s;grace of their mothers; and &s;ome the danger of their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, of tho&s;e who are married, part are already convinced of the fal&s;hood of their wives, and part &s;hut
<PB N="215" REF="216">
their eyes to avoid conviction; few ever &s;ought for virtue in marriage, and therefore few will try whether they have found it. Al|mo&s;t every man is carele&s;s or timorous, and to tru&s;t is &s;afer than to examine.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations di&s;couraged me, till I began to con&s;ider what reception I was like|ly to find among the ladies, whom I have re|viewed under the three cla&s;&s;es of maids, wives, and widows, and cannot but hope that I may obtain &s;ome countenance among them. The &s;ingle ladies I &s;uppo&s;e univer&s;ally ready to patronize my method, by which connubial wickedne&s;s may be detected, &s;ince no woman marries with a previous de&s;ign to be un|faithful to her hu&s;band. And to keep them &s;tea|dy in my cau&s;e, I promi&s;e never to &s;ell one of my magnets to a man who &s;teals a girl from &s;chool; marries a woman forty years younger than him&s;elf; or employs the authority of parents to obtain a wife without her own con&s;ent.</P>
<P>AMONG the married ladies, notwith&s;tand|ing the in&s;inuations of &s;lander, I yet re&s;olve to believe, that the greater part are my
<PB N="216" REF="217">
friends, and am at lea&s;t convinced, that they who demand the te&s;t and appear on my &s;ide, will &s;upply by their &s;pirit the deficiency of their numbers, and that their enemies will &s;hrink and quake at the &s;ight of a magnet, as the &s;laves of <HI>Scythia</HI> fled from the &s;courge.</P>
<P>THE widows will be confederated in my favour by their curio&s;ity, if not by their vir|tue; for it may be ob&s;erved, that women who have out-lived their hu&s;bands, always think them&s;elves entitled to &s;uperintend the conduct of young wives; and as they are them&s;elves in no danger from this magnetick trial, I &s;hall expect them to be eminently and unanimou&s;ly zealous in recommending it.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e hopes I &s;hall, in a &s;hort time, offer to &s;ale magnets armed with a par|ticular metallick compo&s;ition, which con|centrates their virtue, and determines their agency. It is known that the efficacy of the magnet in common operations depends much upon its armature, and it cannot be imagined, that, a &s;tone, naked or ca&s;ed only in the common manner, will di&s;cover the vir|tues a&s;cribed to it by rabbi <HI>Abraham.</HI> The
<PB N="217" REF="218">
&s;ecret of this metal I &s;hall carefully conceal, and, therefore, am not afraid of imitators, nor &s;hall trouble the offices with &s;olicitations for a patent.</P>
<P>I SHALL &s;ell them of different &s;izes, and various degrees of &s;trength. I have &s;ome of a bulk proper to be hung at the bed's head, as &s;care-crows, and &s;ome &s;o &s;mall that they may be ea&s;ily concealed. Some I have ground into oval forms to be hung at watches; and &s;ome for the curious, I have &s;et in wedding|rings, that ladies may never want an atte&s;ta|tion of their innocence. Some I can pro|duce &s;o &s;luggi&s;h and inert, that they will not act before the third failure; and others &s;o vi|gorous and animated, that they exert their influence again&s;t unlawful wi&s;hes, if they have been willingly and deliberately indulged. As it is my practice, hone&s;tly to tell my cu|&s;tomers the properties of my magnets, I can judge by their choice of the delicacy of their &s;entiments. Many have been contented to &s;pare co&s;t by purcha&s;ing only the lowe&s;t de|gree of efficacy, and all have &s;tarted with terror from tho&s;e which operate upon the thoughts. One young lady only &s;itted on a
<PB N="218" REF="219">
ring of the &s;tronge&s;t energy, and declared, that &s;he &s;corned to &s;eparate her wi&s;hes from her acts, or allow her&s;elf to think what &s;he was forbidden to practi&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>To the RAMBLER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. RAMBLER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SUCH is the tenderne&s;s or infirmity of many minds, that when any affliction oppre&s;&s;es them, they have immediate recour&s;e
<PB N="219" REF="220">
to lamentation and complaint, which, though it can only be allowed rea&s;onable when evils admit of remedy, and then only when ad|dre&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e from whom the remedy is ex|pected, yet &s;eems even in hopele&s;s and incu|rable di&s;tre&s;&s;es to be natural, &s;ince tho&s;e by whom it is not indulged, imagine that they give a proof of extraordinary fortitude by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it.</P>
<P>I AM one of tho&s;e who, with the <HI>Sancho</HI> of <HI>Cervantes,</HI> leave to higher characters the merit of &s;uffering in &s;ilence, and give vent without &s;cruple to any &s;orrow that &s;wells in my heart. It is therefore to me a &s;evere aggravation of a calamity, when it is &s;uch as in the common opinion will not ju&s;tify the acerbity of excla|mation, or &s;upport the &s;olemnity of vocal grief. Yet many pains are incident to a man of delicacy, which the unfeeling world can|not be per&s;uaded to pity, and which, when they are &s;eparated from their peculiar and per|&s;onal circum&s;tances, will never be con&s;idered as important enough to claim attention, or de&s;erve redre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="221">
OF this kind will appear to gro&s;s and vul|gar apprehen&s;ions, the mi&s;eries which I en|dured in a morning vi&s;it to <HI>Pro&s;pero,</HI> a man lately rai&s;ed by a lucky project to wealth and grandeur, and too much intoxicated by &s;udden elevation, or too little poli&s;hed by thought and conver&s;ation to enjoy his pre&s;ent fortune with elegance and decency.</P>
<P>WE &s;et out in the world together; and for a long time mutually a&s;&s;i&s;ted each other in our exigencies, as either happened to have money or influence beyond his immediate nece&s;&s;ities. You know that nothing generally endears men &s;o much as participation of dangers and mi&s;|fortunes, I therefore always con&s;idered <HI>Pro&s;|pero</HI> as united with me in the &s;tronge&s;t league of kindne&s;s, and imagined that our friend&s;hip was only to be broken by the hand of death. I felt at his &s;udden &s;hoot of &s;ucce&s;s an hone&s;t and di&s;intere&s;ted joy, but as I want no part of his &s;uperfluities, am not willing to de&s;cend from that equality in which we hitherto have lived.</P>
<P>OUR intimacy was regarded by me as a di&s;pen&s;ation from ceremonial vi&s;its; and it
<PB N="221" REF="222">
was &s;o long before I &s;aw him at his new hou&s;e, that he gently complained of my neg|lect, and obliged me to come on a day ap|pointed. I kept my promi&s;e, but found that the impatience of my friend aro&s;e not from any de&s;ire to communicate his happine&s;s, but to enjoy his &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>WHEN I told my name at the door; the footman went to &s;ee if his ma&s;ter was at home, and, by the tardine&s;s of his return, gave me rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that time was taken to deliberate. He then informed me, that <HI>Pro&s;pero</HI> de&s;ired my company and &s;howed the &s;tairca&s;e carefully &s;ecured by mats from the pollution of my feet. The be&s;t apartments were o&s;tentatiou&s;ly &s;et open, that I might have a di&s;tant view of the magnificence which I was not permitted to approach, and my old friend receiving me with all the in&s;olence of conde&s;cen&s;ion at the top of the &s;tairs, con|ducted me to a back room, where he told me he always breakfa&s;ted when he had not great company.</P>
<P>ON the floor where we &s;at, lay a carpet covered with a cloth, of which <HI>Pro&s;pero</HI> or|dered
<PB N="222" REF="223">
his &s;ervant to lift up a corner, that I might contemplate the brightne&s;s of the co|lours, and the elegance of the texture, and a&s;ked me whether I had ever &s;een any thing &s;o fine before. I did not gratify his folly with any outcries of admiration, but coldly bad the footman let down the cloth.</P>
<P>WE then &s;at down, and I began to hope that pride was glutted with per&s;ecution, when <HI>Pro&s;pero</HI> de&s;ired that I would give the &s;ervant leave to adju&s;t the cover of my chair, which was &s;lipt a little a&s;ide to &s;how the dama&s;k; he informed me that he had be&s;poke ordinary chairs for common u&s;e, but had been di&s;ap|pointed by his trade&s;man. I put the chair a&s;ide with my foot, and drew another &s;o ha|&s;tily that I was entreated not to rumple the carpet.</P>
<P>BREAKFAST was at la&s;t &s;et, and as I was not willing to indulge the peevi&s;hne&s;s that be|gan to &s;eize me, I commended the tea; <HI>Pro&s;|pero</HI> then told me, that another time I &s;hould ta&s;te his &s;ine&s;t &s;ort, but that he had only a very &s;mall quantity remaining, and re&s;erved
<PB N="223" REF="224">
it for tho&s;e whom he thought him&s;elf obliged to treat with particular re&s;pect.</P>
<P>WHILE we were conver&s;ing upon &s;uch &s;ubjects as imagination happened to &s;ugge&s;t, he frequently digre&s;&s;ed into directions to the &s;ervant that waited, or made a &s;light enquiry after the jeweller or &s;ilver&s;mith; and once as I was pur&s;uing an argument with &s;ome de|gree of earne&s;tne&s;s, he &s;tarted from his po|&s;ture of attention, and ordered, that if lord <HI>Lofty</HI> called on him that morning, he &s;hould be &s;hewn into the be&s;t parlour.</P>
<P>MY patience was not yet wholly &s;ubdued. I was willing to promote his &s;atisfaction, and therefore ob&s;erved, that the figures on the china were eminently pretty. <HI>Pro&s;pero</HI> had now an opportunity of calling for his <HI>Dre&s;den</HI> china, which, &s;ays he, I always a&s;&s;ociate with my cha&s;ed tea-kettle. The cups were brought; I was once di&s;po&s;ed not to have looked upon them, but my curio&s;ity prevailed. When I had examined them a little, <HI>Pro&s;pero</HI> de&s;ired me to &s;et them down, for they who were accu&s;tomed only to common di&s;hes, &s;eldom handled china with much care. You will,
<PB N="224" REF="225">
I hope, commend my philo&s;ophy, when I tell you that I did not da&s;h his baubles to the ground.</P>
<P>HE was now &s;o much elevated with his own greatne&s;s, that he thought &s;ome humi|lity nece&s;&s;ary to avert the glance of envy, and therefore told me with an air of &s;oft compo|&s;ure, that I was not to e&s;timate life by exter|nal appearance, that all the&s;e &s;hining acqui|&s;itions had added little to his happine&s;s, that he &s;till remembered with plea&s;ure the days in which he and I were upon the level, and had often in the moment of reflection been doubt|ful, whether he &s;hould lo&s;e much by changing his condition for mine.</P>
<P>I BEGAN now to be afraid le&s;t his pride &s;hould, by &s;ilence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, be embolden|ed to in&s;ults that could not ea&s;ily be born, and, therefore, cooly con&s;idered, how I &s;hould re|pre&s;s it without &s;uch bitterne&s;s of repoof as I was yet unwilling to u&s;e. But he interrupted my meditation by a&s;king leave to be dre&s;&s;ed, and told me, that he had promi&s;ed to attend &s;ome ladies in the park, and, if I was going the &s;ame way, would take me in his chariot.
<PB N="225" REF="226">
I had no inclination to any other favours, and, therefore, left him without any inten|tion of &s;eeing him again, unle&s;s &s;ome mi&s;|fortune &s;hould re&s;tore his under&s;tanding.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>THOUGH I am not wholly in&s;en&s;ible of the provocations which my corre&s;pondent has received, I cannot altogether commend the keenne&s;s of his re&s;entment, nor encourage him to per&s;i&s;t in his re&s;olution of breaking off all commerce with his old acquaintance. One of the golden precepts of <HI>Pythagoras</HI> di|rects that <HI>a friend &s;hould not be hated for little faults</HI>; and &s;urely, he, upon whom nothing wor&s;e can be charged, than that he mats his &s;tairs, and covers his carpet, and &s;ets out his finery to &s;how before tho&s;e whom he does not admit to u&s;e it, has yet committed nothing that &s;hould exclude him from common de|grees of kindne&s;s. Such improprieties often proceed rather from &s;tupidity than malice. Tho&s;e who thus &s;hine only to dazzle, are in|fluenced merely by cu&s;tom and example, and neither examine, nor are qualified to exa|mine,
<PB N="226" REF="227">
the motives of their own practice, or to &s;tate the nice limits between elegance and o&s;tentation. They are often innocent of the pain which their vanity produces, and in&s;ult others when they have no wor&s;e purpo&s;e than to plea&s;e them&s;elves.</P>
<P>HE that too much refines his delicacy will always endanger his quiet. Of tho&s;e with whom nature and virtue oblige us to conver&s;e, &s;ome are ignorant of the arts of plea&s;ing, and offend when they de&s;ign to care&s;s; &s;ome are negligent, and gratify them&s;elves without re|gard to the quiet of another; &s;ome, perhaps, are malicious, and feel no greater &s;atisfaction in pro&s;perity, than that of rai&s;ing envy and trampling inferiority. But whatever be the motive of in&s;ult, it is always be&s;t to over|look it, for folly &s;carcely can de&s;erve re&s;ent|ment, and malice is puni&s;hed by neglect.</P>

<P>IT is ob&s;erved in the writings of <HI>Boyle,</HI> that the excellency of manufactures, and the facility of labour, would be much pro|moted, if the various expedients and contri|vances which lie concealed in private hands, were by reciprocal communications made ge|nerally known; for there are few operations that are not performed by one or other with &s;ome peculiar advantages, which though &s;ing|ly of little importance, would by conjunction and concurrence open new inlets to know|ledge, and give new powers to diligence.</P>
<P>THERE are in like manner &s;everal moral excellencies di&s;tributed among the various cla&s;&s;es of mankind, which he that conver&s;es in the world &s;hould endeavour to a&s;&s;emble in him&s;elf. It was &s;aid by the learned <HI>Cujacius,</HI> that he never read more than one book, by
<PB N="228" REF="229">
which he was not in&s;tructed; and he that &s;hall enquire after virtue with ardour and at|tention, will &s;eldom find a man by who&s;e example or &s;entiments he may not be im|proved.</P>
<P>EVERY profe&s;&s;ion has &s;ome effential and appropriate Virtue, without which there can be no hope of honour or &s;ucce&s;s, and which as it is more or le&s;s cultivated, confers within its &s;phere of activity different degrees of me|rit and reputation. As the a&s;trologers range the &s;ubdivi&s;ions of mankind under the planets which they &s;uppo&s;e to influence their lives, the morali&s;t may di&s;tribute them according to the virtues which they nece&s;&s;arily practi&s;e, and con&s;ider them as di&s;tingui&s;hed by prudence or fortitude, diligence or patience.</P>
<P>So much are the modes of excellence &s;et|tled by time and place, that men may be heard boa&s;ting in one &s;treet of that which they would anxiou&s;ly conceal in another. The grounds of &s;corn and e&s;teem, the to|picks of prai&s;e and &s;atire are varied according to the &s;everal virtues or vices which the cour&s;e of our lives has di&s;po&s;ed us to admire or ab|hor;
<PB N="229" REF="230">
but he who is &s;olicitous for his own im|provement, mu&s;t not &s;uffer his endeavours to be limited by local reputation, but &s;elect from every tribe of mortals their characteri&s;tical virtues, and con&s;tellate in him&s;elf the &s;cat|tered graces which &s;hine &s;ingle in other men.</P>
<P>THE chief prai&s;e to which a trader gene|rally a&s;pires is that of punctuality, or an ex|act and rigorous ob&s;ervance of commercial promi&s;es and engagements; nor is there any vice of which he &s;o much dreads the impu|tation, as of negligence and in&s;tability. This is a quality which the intere&s;t of mankind re|quires to be diffu&s;ed through all the ranks of life, but which, however u&s;eful and valuable, many &s;eem content to want; it is con&s;idered as a vulgar and ignoble virtue, below the am|bition of greatne&s;s or attention of wit, &s;carce|ly requi&s;ite among men of gaiety and &s;pirit, and &s;old at its highe&s;t rate when it is &s;acrificed to a frolick or a je&s;t.</P>
<P>EVERY man has daily occa&s;ion to remark what vexations and inconveniences ari&s;e from this privilege of deceiving one another. The active and vivacious have &s;o long di&s;dained
<PB N="230" REF="231">

<P>NEGLIGENCE is fir&s;t admitted in trivial affairs, and &s;trengthened by petty indulgencies. He that is not yet hardened by cu&s;tom ven|tures not on the violation of important en|gagements, but thinks him&s;elf bound by his word in ca&s;es of property or danger, though he allows him&s;elf to forget at what time he is to meet ladies in the park, or at what tavern his friends are expecting him.</P>
<P>THIS laxity of honour would be more to|lerable if it could be re&s;trained to the play-hou&s;e, the ball-room, or the card-table; yet even there it is &s;ufficiently trouble&s;ome, and darkens tho&s;e moments with expectation, &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, uncertainty, and re&s;entment, which are &s;et a&s;ide for the &s;ofter plea&s;ures of life, and from which we naturally hope for un|mingled enjoyment, and total relaxation. But he that &s;uffers the &s;lighte&s;t breach in his mo|rality, can &s;eldom tell what &s;hall enter it, or
<PB N="231" REF="232">
how wide it &s;hall be made; when a pa&s;&s;age is opened, the influx of corruption is every mo|ment wearing down oppo&s;ition, and by &s;low degrees deluges the heart.</P>
<P><HI>ALIGER</HI> entered the world a youth of lively imagination, exten&s;ive views, and un|tainted principles. His curio&s;ity incited him to range from place to place, and try all the varieties of conver&s;ation; his elegance of ad|dre&s;s and fertility of ideas, gained him friends wherever he appeared; or at lea&s;t he found the general kindne&s;s of reception always &s;hown to a young man who&s;e birth and fortune give him a claim to notice, and who has neither by vice or folly de&s;troyed his privileges. <HI>Aliger</HI> was plea&s;ed with this general &s;mile of man|kind, and being naturally gentle and flexible was indu&s;trious to pre&s;erve it by compliance and officiou&s;ne&s;s, but did not &s;uffer his de&s;ire of plea&s;ing to vitiate his integrity. It was his e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim, that a promi&s;e is never to be broken; nor was it without long reluc|tance that he once &s;uffered him&s;elf to be drawn away from a fe&s;tal engagement by the impor|tunity of another company.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="233">
HE &s;pent the evening, as is u&s;ual in the rudiments of vice, with perturbation and im|perfect enjoyment, and met his di&s;appointed friends in the morning, with confu&s;ion and excu&s;es. His companions not accu&s;tomed to &s;uch &s;crupulous anxiety, laughed at his unea|&s;ine&s;s, compounded the offence for a bottle, gave him courage to break his word again, and again levied the penalty. He ventured the &s;ame experiment upon another &s;ociety, and found them equally ready to con&s;ider it as a venial fault, always incident to a man of quickne&s;s and gaiety; till by degrees, he be|gan to think him&s;elf at liberty to follow the la&s;t invitation, and was no longer &s;hocked at the turpitude of fal&s;hood. He made no dif|ficulty to promi&s;e his pre&s;ence at di&s;tant places, and if li&s;tle&s;ne&s;s happened to creep upon him, would &s;it at home with great tranquility, and has often, while he &s;unk to &s;leep in a chair, held ten tables in continual expectations of his entrance.</P>
<P>HE found it &s;o plea&s;ant to live in perpetual vacancy, that he &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his attention as an u&s;ele&s;s incumbrance, and re&s;igned him|&s;elf to carele&s;ne&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation, without any

regard to the future or the pa&s;t, or any other motive of action than the impul&s;e of a &s;udden de&s;ire, or the attraction of immediate plea|&s;ure. The ab&s;ent were immediately forgotten, and the hopes or fears of others, had no in|fluence upon his conduct. He was in &s;pecu|lation compleatly ju&s;t, but never kept his promi&s;e to a creditor; he was benevolent, but always deceived tho&s;e friends whom he undertook to patronize or a&s;&s;i&s;t; he was pru|dent, but &s;uffered his affairs to be embarra&s;&s;ed for want of &s;ettling his accounts at &s;tated times. He courted a young lady, and when the &s;ettlements were drawn, took a ramble into the country on the day appointed to &s;ign them. He re&s;olved to travel, and &s;ent his che&s;ts on &s;hipboard, but delayed to follow them till he lo&s;t his pa&s;&s;age. He was &s;um|moned as an evidence in a cau&s;e of great im|portance, and loitered on the way till the trial was pa&s;t. It is &s;aid, that when he had with great expence formed an intere&s;t in a borough, his opponent contrived by &s;ome agents, who knew his temper, to lure him away on the day of election.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="235">
HIS benevolence draws him into the com|mi&s;&s;ion of a thou&s;and crimes, which others le&s;s kind or civil, would e&s;cape. His courte&s;y invites application, his promi&s;es produce de|pendence; he has his pockets filled with pe|titions, which he intends &s;ome time to deliver and enforce, and his table covered with letters of reque&s;t, with which he purpo&s;es to com|ply; but time &s;lips imperceptibly away, while he is either idle or bu&s;y; his friends lo&s;e their opportunities, and charge upon him their mi&s;|carriages and calamities.</P>
<P>THIS character however contemptible, is not peculiar to <HI>Aliger.</HI> They who&s;e activity of imagination is often &s;hifting the &s;cenes of expectation, are frequently &s;ubject to &s;uch &s;al|lies of caprice as make all their actions for|tuitous, de&s;troy the value of their friend&s;hip, ob&s;truct the efficacy of their virtues, and &s;et them below the meane&s;t of tho&s;e that per&s;i&s;t in their re&s;olutions, execute what they de&s;ign, and perform what they have promi&s;ed.</P>

<P>AMONG tho&s;e who have endeavoured the promotion of learning, and the rectification of judgment, it has been long cu&s;tomary to complain of the abu&s;e of words, which are often admitted to &s;ignify things &s;o different, that, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the under|&s;tanding as vehicles of knowledge, they pro|duce error, di&s;&s;ention, and perplexity, becau&s;e what is affirmed in one &s;en&s;e, is received in another.</P>
<P>IF this ambiguity &s;ometimes embarra&s;&s;es the mo&s;t &s;olemn controver&s;ies, and ob&s;cures the demon&s;trations of &s;cience, it may well be expected to infe&s;t the pompous periods of declaimers, who&s;e purpo&s;e is often only to amu&s;e with fallacies, and change the co|lours
<PB N="236" REF="237">
of truth and fal&s;hood; or the mu&s;ical compo&s;itions of poets, who&s;e &s;tile is profe&s;&s;ed|ly figurative, and who&s;e art is imagined to con&s;i&s;t in di&s;torting words from their original meaning.</P>
<P>THERE are few words, of which more readers believe them&s;elves to know the import than of <HI>poverty,</HI> yet whoever &s;tudies the poets and philo&s;ophers, will find &s;uch an account of the condition expre&s;&s;ed by that term as his experience or ob&s;ervation will not ea&s;ily di&s;|cover to be true. In&s;tead of the meanne&s;s, di&s;tre&s;s, complaint, anxiety, and dependance which have hitherto been combined in his ideas of poverty, he will read of content, innocence, and chearfulne&s;s, of health, and &s;afety, tranquility, and freedom; of plea&s;ures not known but to men unencumbered with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and of &s;leep that &s;heds his bal|&s;amick anodynes only on the cottage. Such are the ble&s;&s;ings to be obtained by the re&s;igna|tion of riches, that kings might de&s;cend from their thrones, and generals retire from a tri|umph, only to &s;lumber undi&s;turbed in the cly|&s;ium of poverty.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="238">
IF the&s;e authors do not deceive us, nothing can be more ab&s;urd than that perpetual con|te&s;t for wealth which keeps the world in com|motion, and fills almo&s;t every mind with &s;tra|tagems and competition; nor can any com|plaints be more ju&s;tly cen&s;ured than tho&s;e which proceed from want of the gifts of for|tune, which we are taught by the great ma|&s;ters of moral wi&s;dom to con&s;ider as golden &s;hackles, by which the wearer is at once di&s;|abled and adorned; as lu&s;cious poi&s;ons which may for a time plea&s;e the palate, but &s;oon betray their malignity by languor and by pain.</P>
<P>IT is the great privilege of poverty to be happy unenvied, to be healthful without phy|&s;ic, and &s;ecure without a guard; to obtain from the bounty of nature, what the great and wealthy are compelled to procure by the help of arti&s;ts and attendants, of flatterers and &s;pies.</P>
<P>BUT it will be found upon a nearer view, that they who extol the happine&s;s of poverty, do not mean the &s;ame &s;tate with tho&s;e who deplore its mi&s;eries. Poets have their imagi|nations
<PB N="238" REF="239">
filled with ideas of magnificence; and being accu&s;tomed to contemplate the downfal of empires, or to contrive forms of lamenta|tion for monarchs in di&s;tre&s;s, rank all the cla&s;&s;es of mankind in a &s;tate of poverty, who make no approaches to the dignity of crowns. To be poor in the epick language, is only not to command the wealth of nations, not to have fleets and armies in pay.</P>
<P>VANITY has perhaps contributed to this impropriety of &s;tile. He that wi&s;hes to be|come a philo&s;opher at a cheap rate, ea&s;ily gra|tifies his ambition by &s;ubmitting to poverty when he does not feel it, and by boa&s;ting his contempt of riches, when he has already more than he enjoys. He who would &s;how the extent of his views, and grandeur of his conceptions, or di&s;cover his acquaintance with &s;plendor and magnificence, may talk like <HI>Cowley</HI> of an humble &s;tation and quiet ob|&s;curity, of the paucity of nature's wants, and the inconveniencies of &s;uperfluity, and at la&s;t, like him, limit his de&s;ires to five hundred pounds a year: A fortune indeed not exube|rant when we compare it with the expences of pride and luxury, but to which it little be|comes
<PB N="239" REF="240">
a philo&s;opher to affix the name of po|verty, &s;ince no man can with any propriety be termed poor, who does not &s;ee the greater part of mankind richer than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>AS little is the general condition of human life under&s;tood by panegyri&s;ts and hi&s;torians, who amu&s;e us with accounts of the poverty of heroes and &s;ages. Riches are of no value in them&s;elves, their u&s;e is di&s;covered only in that which they procure. They are not co|veted, unle&s;s by a few narrow under&s;tandings which confound the means with the end, but for the &s;ake of power, influence, and e&s;teem; or, by &s;ome of le&s;s elevated and refined &s;enti|ments, as nece&s;&s;ary to &s;en&s;ual enjoyment.</P>
<P>THE plea&s;ures of luxury, many have, without uncommon virtue, been able to de|&s;pi&s;e, even when affluence and idlene&s;s have concurred to tempt them; and therefore he who feels nothing from indigence but the want of gratifications which he could not in any other condition make con&s;i&s;tent with in|nocence, has given no proof of eminent pa|tience. E&s;teem and influence every man de|&s;ires, but they are equally plea&s;ing, and equal|ly
<PB N="240" REF="241">
valuable, by whatever means they are ob|tained; and whoever has found the art of &s;ecuring them without the help of money, ought, in reality, to be accounted rich, &s;ince he has all that riches can purcha&s;e to a wi&s;e man. <HI>Cincinnatus,</HI> though he lived upon a few acres cultivated by his own hand, was &s;ufficiently removed from all the evils gene|rally comprehended under the name of po|verty, when his reputation was &s;uch that the voice of his country called him from his farm to take ab&s;olute command into his hand; nor was <HI>Diogenes</HI> much mortified by his re&s;idence in a tub, where he was honoured with the vi&s;it of <HI>Alexander</HI> the great.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame fallacy has conciliated venera|tion to the religious orders. When we be|hold a man abdicating the hope of terre&s;trial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and precluding him&s;elf by an ir|revocable vow from the pur&s;uit and acqui&s;i|tion of all that his fellow beings con&s;ider as worthy of wi&s;hes and endeavours, we are immediately &s;truck with the purity, ab&s;trac|tion, and firmne&s;s of his mind, and regard him as wholly employed in &s;ecuring the inte|re&s;ts of futurity, and devoid of any other care
<PB N="241" REF="242">
than to gain at whatever price the &s;ure&s;t pa&s;|&s;age to eternal re&s;t.</P>
<P>YET what can the votary be ju&s;tly &s;aid to have lo&s;t of his pre&s;ent happine&s;s. If he re|&s;ides in a convent, he conver&s;es only with men who&s;e condition is the &s;ame with his own; he has from the munificence of the founder all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and is &s;afe from that <HI>de&s;titution, which</HI> Hooker declares to be <HI>&s;uch an impediment to virtue as, till it be removed, &s;uffereth not the mind of man to ad|mit any other care.</HI> All temptations to envy and competition are &s;hut out from his re|treat; he is not pained with the &s;ight of un|attainable dignity, nor in&s;ulted with the blu|&s;ter of in&s;olence, or the &s;mile of forced fa|miliarity. If he wanders abroad, the &s;ancti|ty of his character amply compen&s;ates all other di&s;tinctions, he is never &s;een but with reverence, nor heard but with obedience.</P>
<P>IT has been remarked, that death, though often de&s;ied in the field, &s;eldom fails to ter|rify when it approaches the bed of &s;ickne&s;s in its natural horror; &s;o poverty may ea&s;ily

<P>EVERY one has &s;o often detected the fal|laciou&s;ne&s;s of hope, and the inconvenience of teaching him&s;elf to expect what a thou&s;and accidents may preclude, that, when time has abated the confidence with which youth ru&s;hes out to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the world, we en|deavour,

<P>BUT &s;o full is the world of calamity, that every &s;ource of plea&s;ure is polluted, and eve|ry retirement of tranquillity di&s;turbed. When time has &s;upplied us with events &s;ufficient to employ our thoughts, it has mingled them with &s;o many di&s;a&s;ters, that we &s;hrink from their remembrance, dread their intru&s;ion up|on our minds, and fly from them to company and diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>No man pa&s;t the middle point of life can &s;it down to fea&s;t upon the plea&s;ures of youth without finding the banquet imbittered by the cup of &s;orrow. Many days of harmle&s;s fro|lick, or nights of hone&s;t fe&s;tivity will per|haps recur; he may revive lucky accidents, and plea&s;ing extravagancies; or, if he has been engaged in &s;cenes of action, and ac|quainted with affairs of difficulty and vici&s;&s;i|tudes of fortune, may enjoy the nobler plea|&s;ure of looking back upon di&s;tre&s;s firmly &s;up|ported,

There are few higher gratifications than that of reflection on &s;ur|mounted evils, when they were not incurred nor protracted by our fault, and neither re|proached us with cowardice, nor guilt.</P>
<P>BUT this felicity is almo&s;t always abated by the reflection, that they, with whom we &s;hould be mo&s;t plea&s;ed to &s;hare it, are now in the grave. A few years make &s;uch havock in human generations, that we &s;oon &s;ee our|&s;elves deprived of tho&s;e with whom we enter|ed the world, and whom the participation of plea&s;ures or fatigues endeared to our remem|brance. The man of enterpri&s;e, recounts his adventures and expedients, but is forced at the clo&s;e of the relation to pay a &s;ign to the names of tho&s;e that contributed to his &s;ucce&s;s; he that pa&s;&s;es his life among the gayer part of mankind, has quickly his remembrance &s;tored with remarks and repartees of wits, who&s;e

&s;prightline&s;s and merriment are now lo&s;t in perpetual &s;ilence; the trader who&s;e indu&s;try has &s;upplied the want of inheritance, when he &s;its down to enjoy his fortune, repines in &s;olitary plenty at the ab&s;ence of companions with whom he had planned out amu&s;ements for his latter years; and the &s;cholar who&s;e merit, after a long &s;eries of efforts rai&s;es him from ob&s;curity, looks round in vain from his exaltation for his old friends or enemies, who&s;e applau&s;e or mortification would heighten his triumph.</P>
<P>AMONG <HI>Martial</HI>'s requi&s;ites to happine&s;s is, <HI>Res non parta labore &s;ed relicta,</HI> an e&s;tate not gained by indu&s;try but left by inheritance. It is nece&s;&s;ary to the completion of every good, that it be timely obtained, for what|ever comes at the clo&s;e of life, will come too late to give much delight. Yet all human happine&s;s, has its imperfections. Of what we do not gain for our&s;elves we have only a faint and imperfect fruition, becau&s;e we can|not compare the difference between want and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or at lea&s;t can derive from it no conviction of our own abilities, nor any en|crea&s;e of &s;elf e&s;teem; what we acquire by
<PB N="246" REF="247">
bravery or &s;cience, by mental or corporeal di|ligence, comes at la&s;t when we cannot com|municate, and therefore cannot enjoy it.</P>
<P>THUS every period of life is obliged to borrow its happine&s;s from the time to come. In youth we have nothing pa&s;t to entertain us, and in age, we derive little from retro&s;pect but hopele&s;s &s;orrow. Yet the future likewi&s;e has its limits, which the imagination dreads to approach, but which we know to be not far di&s;tant. The lo&s;s of our friends and companions, impre&s;&s;es hourly upon us the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of our own departure: We know that the &s;chemes of man are quickly at an end, that we mu&s;t &s;oon lie down in the grave with the forgotten multitudes of former ages, and yield our place to others, who, like us, &s;hall be driven awhile by hope or fear about the &s;ur|face of the earth, and then like us be lo&s;t in the &s;hades of death.</P>
<P>BEYOND this termination of our corporeal exi&s;tence, we are therefore obliged to extend our hopes, and almo&s;t every man indulges his imagination with &s;omething, which is not to happen till he has changed his manner of ex|i&s;tence:
<PB N="247" REF="248">
Some amu&s;e them&s;elves with entails and &s;ettlements, provide for the encrea&s;e and perpetuation of families and honours, or con|trive to obviate the di&s;&s;ipation of the fortunes, which it has been their bu&s;ine&s;s to accumu|late: Others more refined or exalted congra|tulate their own hearts upon the future ex|tent of their reputation, the reverence of di|&s;tant nations, and the gratitude of unpreju|diced po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THEY who&s;e &s;ouls are &s;o chained down to coffers and tenements, that they cannot conceive a &s;tate in which they &s;hall look upon them with le&s;s &s;olicitude, are &s;eldom atten|tive to remon&s;trance, or flexible to argu|ments; but the votaries of fame are capa|ble of reflection, and, therefore, may be fitly called to recon&s;ider the probability of their expectations.</P>
<P>WHETHER to be remembered in remote times be worthy of a wi&s;e man's wi&s;h, has not yet been &s;atisfactorily decided, and in|deed, to be long remembered, can happen to &s;o &s;mall a number, that the bulk of mankind has very little intere&s;t in the que&s;tion. There
<PB N="248" REF="249">
is never room in the world for more than a certain quantity, or mea&s;ure of renown. The nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of life, the immediate plea|&s;ures or pains of every condition, leave us not lei&s;ure beyond a fixed proportion for contem|plations which do not forcibly influence our pre&s;ent welfare. When this vacuity is filled no characters can be admitted into the circu|lation of fame, but by occupying the place of &s;ome that mu&s;t be thru&s;t into oblivion. The eye of the mind, like that of the body, can only extend its view to new objects, by lo&s;ing &s;ight of tho&s;e which are now be|fore it.</P>
<P>REPUTATION is therefore a meteor which blazes a while and di&s;appears for ever; and if we except a few tran&s;cendent and invincible names, which no revolutions of opinion or length of time is able to &s;uppre&s;s; all tho&s;e that engage our thoughts, or diver&s;ify our conver&s;ation, are every moment ha&s;ting to ob&s;curity, as new favourites are adopted by fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>IT is not therefore from this world that any ray of comfort can procede, to cheer the
<PB N="249" REF="250">
gloom of the la&s;t hour. But futurity has &s;till its pro&s;pects; there is yet happine&s;s in re|&s;erve, which, if we transfer our attention to it, will &s;upport us in the pains of di&s;ea&s;e, and the languor of decay. This happine&s;s we may expect with confidence, becau&s;e it is out of the power of chance, and may be attained by all that &s;incerely de&s;ire and earne&s;tly pur|&s;ue it. On this therefore every mind ought finally to re&s;t. Hope is the chief ble&s;&s;ing of man, and that hope only is rational, of which we are certain that it cannot deceive us.</P>

At length, <HI>Seged,</HI> reflect and be wi&s;e. What is the gift of conque&s;t but &s;afety, why are riches collected but to purcha&s;e happine&s;s?"</P>
<P><HI>SEGED</HI> then ordered his hou&s;e of plea|&s;ure, built in an i&s;land of the lake <HI>Dambia</HI> to be prepared for his reception. "I will retire, &s;ays he, for ten days from tumult and care, from coun&s;els and decrees. Long quiet is not the lot of the governors of na|tions, but a ce&s;&s;ation of ten days cannot be denied me. This &s;hort interval of happi|ne&s;s, may &s;urely be &s;ecured from the inter|ruption of fear or perplexity, &s;orrow on di&s;appointment. I will exclude all trouble from my abode, and remove from my thoughts whatever may confu&s;e the harmo|ny of the concert, or abate the &s;weetne&s;s
<PB N="252" REF="253">
of the banquet. I will fill the whole capa|city of my &s;oul with enjoyment, and try what it is to live without a wi&s;h un&s;a|tisfied."</P>
<P>IN a few days the orders were performed, and <HI>Seged</HI> ha&s;ted to the palace of <HI>Dambia,</HI> which &s;tood in an i&s;land cultivated only for plea&s;ure, planted with every flower that &s;preads its colours to the &s;un, and every &s;hrub that &s;heds fragrance in the air. In one part of this exten&s;ive garden, were open walks for excur&s;ions in the morning, in another, thick groves, and &s;ilent arbours, and bubbling foun|tains for repo&s;e at noon. All that could &s;o|lace the &s;en&s;e, or flatter the fancy, all that indu&s;try could extort from nature, or wealth furni&s;h to art, all that conque&s;t could &s;eize, or beneficence attract, was collected together, and every perception of delight was excited and gratified.</P>
<P>INTO this delicious region <HI>Seged</HI> &s;ummoned all the per&s;ons of his court, who &s;eemed emi|nently qualified to receive, or communicate plea&s;ure. His call was readily obeyed; the young, the fair, the vivacious, and the witty,
<PB N="253" REF="254">
were all in ha&s;te to be &s;ated with felicity. They &s;ailed jocund over the lake, which &s;eemed to &s;mooth its &s;urface before them: Their pa&s;&s;age was cheered with mu&s;ick, and their hearts dilated with expectation.</P>
<P><HI>SEGED</HI> landing here with his band of plea&s;ure, determined from that hour to break off all acquaintance with di&s;content, to give his heart for ten days to ea&s;e and jollity, and then fall back to the common &s;tate of man, and &s;uffer his life to be diver&s;ified, as before, with joy and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>HE immediately entered his chamber, to con&s;ider where he &s;hould begin his circle of happine&s;s. He had all the arti&s;ts of delight before him, but knew not whom to call, &s;ince he could not enjoy one, but by delaying the performance of another. He cho&s;e and re|jected, he re&s;olved and changed his re&s;olu|tion, till his faculties were harra&s;&s;ed, and his thoughts confu&s;ed; then returned to the ap|partment where his pre&s;ence was expected, with languid eyes and clouded countenance, and &s;pread the infection of unea&s;ine&s;s over the whole a&s;&s;embly. He ob&s;erved their depre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="254" REF="255">
and was offended, for he found his vexation en|crea&s;ed by tho&s;e whom he expected to di&s;&s;ipate and relieve it. He retired again to his private chamber, and &s;ought for con&s;olation in his own mind; one thought flowed in upon ano|ther; a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of images &s;eized his attention; the moments crept imperceptibly away through the gloom of pen&s;ivene&s;s, till having recovered his tranquility, he lifted up his head, and &s;aw the lake brightened by the &s;etting &s;un. "Such, &s;aid <HI>Seged</HI> &s;ighing, is the longer day of human exi&s;tence: Be|fore we have learned to u&s;e it, we find it at an end."</P>
<P>THE regret, which he felt for the lo&s;s of &s;o great a part of his fir&s;t day, took from him all inclination to enjoy the evening; and, af|ter having endeavoured for the &s;ake of his attendants to force an air of gaiety, and ex|cite that mirth which he could not &s;hare, he re&s;olved to refer his hopes to the next morn|ing, and lay down upon his bed, to partake with the &s;laves of labour and poverty the ble&s;|&s;ing of &s;leep.</P>
<P>HE ro&s;e early the &s;econd morning, and re|&s;olved now to be happy. He therefore fixed
<PB N="255" REF="256">
upon the gate of the palace an edict im|porting, that whoever, during nine days, &s;hould appear in the pre&s;ence of the king with dejected countenance, or utter any ex|pre&s;&s;ion of di&s;content or &s;orrow, &s;hould be driven for ever from the palace of <HI>Dambia.</HI></P>
<P>THIS edict was immediately made known in every chamber of the court, and bower of the gardens. Mirth was frighted away, and they who were before dancing in the lawns, or &s;inging in the &s;hades, were at once en|gaged in the care of regulating their looks, that <HI>Seged</HI> might find his will punctually obey|ed, and &s;ee none among them liable to ba|ni&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>SEGED</HI> now met every face &s;ettled in a &s;mile; but a &s;mile that betrayed &s;olicitude, timidity, and con&s;traint. He acco&s;ted his fa|vourites with familiarity and &s;oftne&s;s; but they dur&s;t not &s;peak without premeditation, le&s;t they &s;hould be convicted of di&s;content or &s;orrow. He propo&s;ed diver&s;ions, to which no objection was made, becau&s;e objection would have implied unea&s;ine&s;s; but they were regarded with indifference by the courtiers,
<PB N="256" REF="257">
who had no other de&s;ire than to &s;ignalize them&s;elves by clamorous exultation. He of|fered various topics of conver&s;ation, but ob|tained only forced je&s;ts, and laborious laugh|ter, and after many attempts to animate them to confidence and alacrity, was obliged to confe&s;s to him&s;elf the impotence of command, and re&s;ign another day to grief and di&s;appoint|ment.</P>
<P>HE at la&s;t relieved his companions from their terrors, and &s;hut him&s;elf up in his cham|ber to a&s;certain, by &s;ome different mea&s;ures, the felicity of the &s;ucceeding days. At length, he threw him&s;elf on the bed and clo&s;ed his eyes, but imagined in his &s;leep, that his pa|lace and gardens were overwhelmed by an inundation, and waked with all the terrors of a man &s;truggling in the water. He compo&s;ed him&s;elf again to re&s;t, but was di&s;turbed by an imaginary irruption into his kingdom, and &s;triving, as is u&s;ual in dreams, without abi|lity to move, fancied him&s;elf betrayed to his enemies, and again &s;tarted up with horror and indignation.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="258">
IT was now day, and fear was &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on his mind, that he could &s;leep no more. He ro&s;e, but his thoughts were filled with the deluge and inva&s;ion, nor was he able to di&s;engage his attention, or mingle with vacancy or ea&s;e in any amu&s;ement. At length his perturbation gave way to rea&s;on, and he re&s;olved no longer to be harra&s;&s;ed by a dream; but before this re&s;olution could be completely formed, half the day had elap&s;ed: He felt a new conviction of the uncertainty of all human &s;chemes, and could not forbear to bewail the frailty and weakne&s;s of that being, who&s;e quiet could be interrupted by vapours of the fancy. Having been fir&s;t di&s;|turbed by a dream, he was afterwards grieved that a dream could di&s;turb him. He at la&s;t di&s;covered, that his terrors and grief were equally vain, and, that to lo&s;e the pre&s;ent in lamenting the pa&s;t, was voluntarily to pro|tract a melancholy vi&s;ion. The third day was now declining, and <HI>Seged</HI> again re&s;olved to be happy on the morrow.</P>

<P>ON the fourth morning <HI>Seged</HI> ro&s;e early, refre&s;hed with &s;leep, vigorous with health, and eager with expectation. He en|tered the garden attended by the princes and ladies of his court, and &s;eeing nothing about him but airy cheerfulne&s;s, began to &s;ay to his heart, "This day &s;hall be a day of plea&s;ure." The &s;un played upon the water, the birds warbled in the groves, and the gales quivered among the branches. He roved from walk to walk as chance directed him, and &s;ometimes li&s;tened to the &s;ongs, &s;ometimes mingled with the dancers, &s;ometimes let loo&s;e his imagi|nation in flights of merriment; and &s;ome|times uttered grave reflections, and &s;enten|tious maxims, and fea&s;ted on the admiration with which they were received.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="260">
THUS the day rolled on, without any ac|cident of vexation or intru&s;ion of melancholy thoughts. All that beheld him caught glad|ne&s;s from his looks, and the &s;ight of happi|ne&s;s conferred by him&s;elf filled his heart with &s;atisfaction: But having pa&s;&s;ed three hours in this harmle&s;s luxury, he was alarmed on a &s;udden by an univer&s;al &s;cream among the wo|men, and turning back, &s;aw the whole a&s;&s;em|bly flying in confu&s;ion. A young crocodile had ri&s;en out of the lake, and was ranging the garden in wantonne&s;s or hunger. <HI>Seged</HI> beheld him with indignation, as a di&s;turber of his felicity, and cha&s;ed him back into the lake, but could not per&s;uade his retinue to &s;tay, or free their hearts from the terror which had &s;eized upon them. The prince&s;&s;es in|clo&s;ed them&s;elves in the palace, and could yet &s;carcely believe them&s;elves in &s;afety. Eve|ry attention was fixed upon the late danger and e&s;cape, and no mind was any longer at lei|&s;ure for gay &s;allies or carele&s;s prattle.</P>
<P><HI>SEGED</HI> had now no other employment than to contemplate the innumerable ca&s;ual|ties which lie in ambu&s;h on every &s;ide to in|tercept the happine&s;s of man, and break in
<PB N="260" REF="261">
upon the hour of delight and tranquility. He had however, the con&s;olation of thinking, that he had not been now di&s;appointed by his own fault, and that the accident, which had bla&s;ted the hopes of the day, might ea&s;ily be prevented by future caution.</P>
<P>THAT he might provide for the plea&s;ure of the next morning, he re&s;olved to repeal his penal edict, &s;ince he had already found that di&s;content and melancholy were not to be frighted away by the threats of authority, and that plea&s;ure would only re&s;ide where &s;he was exempted from control. He therefore invited all the companions of his retreat to unbounded plea&s;antry, by propo&s;ing prizes for tho&s;e who &s;hould on the following day di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves by any fe&s;tive performances; the tables of the antichamber were covered with gold and pearls, and robes and garlands, decreed the rewards of tho&s;e who could refine elegance or heighten plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>AT this di&s;play of riches every eye imme|diately &s;parkled, and every tongue was bu&s;ied in celebrating the bounty and magnificence of the emperor. But when <HI>Seged</HI> entered in
<PB N="261" REF="262">
hopes of uncommon entertainment from uni|ver&s;al emulation, he found that any pa&s;&s;ion too &s;trongly agitated, puts an end to that tranquility which is nece&s;&s;ary to mirth, and that the mind, that is to be moved by the gentle ventilations of gaiety, mu&s;t be fir&s;t &s;moothed by a total calm. Whatever we ar|dently wi&s;h to gain, we mu&s;t in the &s;ame de|gree be afraid to lo&s;e, and fear and plea&s;ure cannot dwell together.</P>
<P>ALL was now care and &s;olicitude. No|thing was done or &s;poken, but with &s;o vi&s;ible an endeavour at perfection, as always failed to delight, though it &s;ometimes forced admira|tion: And <HI>Seged</HI> could not but ob&s;erve with &s;orrow, that his prizes had more influence than him&s;elf. As the evening approached, the conte&s;t grew more earne&s;t, and tho&s;e who were forced to allow them&s;elves excelled, be|gan to di&s;cover the malignity of defeat, fir&s;t by angry glances, and at la&s;t by contemptu|ous murmurs. <HI>Seged</HI> likewi&s;e &s;hared the anxiety of the day, for con&s;idering him&s;elf as obliged to di&s;tribute with exact ju&s;tice the prizes which had been &s;o zealou&s;ly &s;ought, he dur&s;t never remit his attention, but pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="262" REF="263">
his time in balancing different kinds of me|rit, and adju&s;ting the claims of all the com|petitors.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t knowing, that no exactne&s;s could fatisfy tho&s;e who&s;e hopes he &s;hould di&s;appoint, and thinking that on a day &s;et apart for hap|pine&s;s, it would be cruel to oppre&s;s any heart with &s;orrow, he declared that all had plea&s;ed him alike, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all with pre&s;ents of equal value.</P>
<P><HI>SEGED</HI> &s;aw that his caution had not been able to avoid offence. They who had believed them&s;elves &s;ecure of the highe&s;t prizes, were not plea&s;ed to be levelled with the crowd; and though by the liberality of the king, they received more than his promi&s;e had intitled them to expect, they departed un|&s;atisfied, becau&s;e they were honoured with no di&s;tinction, and wanted an opportunity to triumph in the mortification of their oppo|nents. "Behold here, &s;aid <HI>Seged,</HI> the con|dition of him who places his happine&s;s in the happine&s;s of others." He then retired to meditate, and, while the courtiers were
<PB N="263" REF="264">
repining at his di&s;tributions, &s;aw the fifth &s;un go down in di&s;content.</P>
<P>THE next dawn renewed his re&s;olution to be happy. But having learned how little he could effect by &s;ettled &s;chemes or preparatory mea&s;ures, he thought it be&s;t to give up one day entirely to chance, and left every one to plea&s;e and be plea&s;ed his own way.</P>
<P>THIS relaxation of regularity diffu&s;ed a general complacence through the whole court, and the emporor imagined, that he had at la&s;t found the &s;ecret of obtaining an interval of felicity. But as he was roving in this care|le&s;s a&s;&s;embly with equal carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, he over|heard one of his courtiers in a clo&s;e arbour murmuring to him&s;elf: "What merit has <HI>Seged</HI> above us, that we &s;hould thus fear and obey him, a man, whom, whatever he may have formerly performed, his luxury now &s;hews to have the &s;ame weakne&s;s with our&s;elves." This charge affected him the more, as it was uttered by one whom he had always ob&s;erved among the mo&s;t abject of his flatterers. At fir&s;t his indignation prompted him to &s;everity; but reflecting that what
<PB N="264" REF="265">
was &s;poken, without intention to be heard, was to be con&s;idered as only thought, and was perhaps but the &s;udden bur&s;t of ca&s;u|al and temporary vexation, he invented &s;ome decent pretence to &s;end him away, that his retreat might not be tainted with the breath of envy, and after the &s;truggle of de|liberation was pa&s;t, and all de&s;ire of revenge utterly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, pa&s;&s;ed the evening not only with tranquillity, but triumph, though none but him&s;elf was con&s;cious of the victory.</P>
<P>THE remembrance of this clemency cheer|ed the beginning of the &s;eventh day, and no|thing happened to di&s;turb the plea&s;ure of <HI>Seged</HI> till looking on the tree that &s;haded him, he recollected, that under a tree of the &s;ame kind he had pa&s;&s;ed the night after his defeat in the kingdom of <HI>Goiama.</HI> The reflection on his lo&s;s, his di&s;honour, and the mi&s;eries which his &s;ubjects &s;uffered from the invader, filled him with &s;adne&s;s. At la&s;t he &s;hook off the weight of &s;orrow, and began to &s;olace him|&s;elf with his u&s;ual plea&s;ures, when his tran|quillity was again di&s;turbed by jealou&s;ies which the late conte&s;t for the prizes had produced, and which having in vain tried to pacify
<PB N="265" REF="266">
them by per&s;ua&s;ion, he was forced to &s;ilence by command.</P>
<P>ON the eighth morning <HI>Seged</HI> was awa|kened early by an unu&s;ual hurry in the apart|ments, and enquiring the cau&s;e, was told, that the prince&s;s <HI>Balkis</HI> was &s;eized with &s;ick|ne&s;s. He ro&s;e, and calling the phy&s;icians found that they had little hope of her reco|very. Here was an end of jollity: All his thoughts were now upon his daughter, who&s;e eyes he clo&s;ed on the tenth day.</P>
<P>SUCH were the days which <HI>Seged</HI> of <HI>Ethio|pia</HI> had appropriated to a &s;hort re&s;piration from the fatigues of war and the cares of government. This narrative he has bequeath|ed to future generations, that no man here|after may pre&s;ume to &s;ay, "This day &s;hall be a day of happine&s;s."</P>

<P>YET this conflict of de&s;ires &s;ometimes pro|duces wonderful efforts. To riot in far-&s;etch'd di&s;hes, or &s;urfeit with unexhau&s;ted variety, and yet practi&s;e the mo&s;t rigid oeconomy, is &s;urely an art which may ju&s;tly draw the eyes of mankind upon them who&s;e indu&s;try or judgment, has enabled them to attain it. To him, indeed, who is content to break open the che&s;ts, or mortgage the manors of his ance&s;tors, that he may hire the mini&s;ters of exce&s;s at the highe&s;t price, gluttony is an ea&s;y &s;cience; yet we often hear the votaries of luxury, boa&s;ting of the elegance which they owe to the ta&s;te of others, relating with rap|ture
<PB N="268" REF="269">
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of di&s;hes with which their cooks and caterers &s;upply them; and expect|ing their &s;hare of prai&s;e with the di&s;coverers of arts and the civilizers of nations. But to &s;horten the way to convivial happine&s;s, by eating without co&s;t, is a &s;ecret hitherto in few hands, but which certainly de&s;erves the curio&s;ity of tho&s;e who&s;e principal enjoyment is their dinner, and who &s;ee the &s;un ri&s;e with no other hope than that they &s;hall fill their bellies before it &s;ets.</P>
<P>OF them that have within my know|ledge attempted this &s;cheme of happine&s;s, the greater part have been immediately obliged to de&s;i&s;t; and &s;ome, whom their fir&s;t attempts flattered with &s;ucce&s;s, were reduced by degrees to a few tables, from which they were at la&s;t cha&s;ed to make way for others, and having long habituated them&s;elves to &s;uperfluous plen|ty, growled away their latter years in di&s;con|tented competence.</P>
<P>NONE enter the regions of luxury with higher expectations than men of wit, who imagine, that they &s;hall never want a wel|come to that company who&s;e ideas they can
<PB N="269" REF="270">
enlarge, or who&s;e imaginations they can ele|vate, and believe them&s;elves able to pay for their wine with the mirth which it qualifies them to produce. Full of this opinion they crowd, with little invitation, wherever the &s;mell of a fea&s;t allures them, but are &s;eldom encouraged to repeat their vi&s;its, being dread|ed by the pert as rivals, and hated by the dull as di&s;turbers of the company.</P>
<P>No man has been &s;o happy in gaining and keeping the privilege of living at luxurious hou&s;es as <HI>Gulo&s;ulus,</HI> who, after thirty years of continual revelry, I as now e&s;tabli&s;hed by un|controverted pre&s;cription his claim to partake of every entertainment, and who&s;e pre&s;ence they who a&s;pire to the prai&s;e of a &s;umptuous table, are careful to procure on a day of im|portance, by &s;ending the invitation a fortnight before.</P>
<P><HI>GULOSULUS</HI> entered the world with|out any eminent degree of merit; but was careful to frequent hou&s;es, where per&s;ons of rank re&s;orted. By being often &s;een, he be|came in time known; and from &s;itting in the &s;ame room, was &s;uffered to mix in idle con|ver&s;ation,
<PB N="270" REF="271">
or a&s;&s;i&s;ted to fill up a vacant hour, when better amu&s;ement was not readily to be had. From the coffee-hou&s;e he was &s;ome|times taken away to dinner; and, as no man refu&s;es the acquaintance of him, whom he &s;ees admitted to familiarity by others of equal dignity, when he had been met at a few ta|bles, he with le&s;s difficulty found the way to more, till at la&s;t he was regularly expected to appear wherever preparations are made for a fea&s;t, within the circuit of his acquaintance.</P>
<P>WHEN he was thus by accident initiated in luxury, he felt in him&s;elf no inclination to retire from a life of &s;o much plea&s;ure, and therefore very &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered how he might continue it. Great qualities or un|common accompli&s;hments he did not find nece&s;&s;ary to his de&s;ign; for he had already &s;een that they who&s;e merit is allowed ra|ther enforce re&s;pect than attract fondne&s;s; and as he thought no folly greater than that of lo&s;ing a dinner for any other gratification, he often congratulated him&s;elf, that he had none of that di&s;gu&s;ting excellence which impre&s;&s;es awe upon greatne&s;s, and condemns its po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors
<PB N="271" REF="272">
to the &s;ociety of tho&s;e who are wi&s;e or brave and indigent as them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>GULOSULUS</HI> having never allotted much of his time to books or meditation had no opinion in philo&s;ophy or politicks, and was not in danger of injuring his intere&s;t by dogmatical po&s;itions or violent contradiction. If a di&s;pute aro&s;e, he took care to li&s;ten with earne&s;t attention, and when either &s;peaker grew vehement and loud turned towards him with eager quickne&s;s, and uttered a &s;hort phra&s;e of admiration, as if &s;urpri&s;ed by &s;uch cogency of argument as he had never known before. By this &s;ilent conce&s;&s;ion, he gene|rally pre&s;erved in either controverti&s;t &s;uch a conviction of his own &s;uperiority as inclined him rather to pity than irritate his adver&s;ary, and prevented tho&s;e outrages which are &s;ome|times produced by the rage of defeat or petu|lance of triumph.</P>

<P>IT &s;ometimes happens that the in&s;olence of wealth breaks into contemptuou&s;ne&s;s, or the turbulence of wine requires a vent; and <HI>Gulo|&s;ulus</HI> &s;eldom fails of being &s;ingled out on &s;uch emergencies, as one on whom any experi|ment of ribaldry may be &s;afely tryed. Some|times his lord&s;hip finds him&s;elf inclined to ex|hibit a &s;pecimen of raillery for the diver&s;ion of his gue&s;ts, and <HI>Gulo&s;ulus</HI> always &s;upplies him with a &s;ubject of merriment. But he has learned to con&s;ider rudene&s;s and indignities as familiarities that entitle him to greater free|dom: He comforts him&s;elf, that tho&s;e who treat and in&s;ult him pay for their laughter, and ob&s;erves that he keeps his money, and they enjoy their je&s;t.</P>
<P>HIS chief policy con&s;i&s;ts in &s;electing &s;ome di&s;h from every cour&s;e, and recommending it to the company, with an air &s;o deci&s;ive, that no one ventures to contradict him. By this practice he acquires at a fea&s;t a kind of dicta|torial authority; his ta&s;te becomes the &s;tand|ard of pickles and &s;ea&s;oning, and he is vene|rated by the profe&s;&s;ors of epicuri&s;m, as the only man who under&s;tands the niceties of cookery.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="274">
WHENEVER a new &s;auce is imported, or any innovation made in the culinary &s;y&s;tem, he procures the earlie&s;t intelligence, and the mo&s;t authentick receipt; and, by communi|cating his knowledge under proper injunctions of &s;ecrecy, gains a right of ta&s;ting his own di&s;h whenever it is prepared, that he may tell whether his directions have been fully under|&s;tood.</P>
<P>BY this method of life <HI>Gulo&s;ulus</HI> has &s;o im|pre&s;&s;ed on his imagination the dignity of fea&s;t|ing that he has no other topic of talk, or &s;ub|ject of meditation. Others may prate of tro|picks and the zodiac, his calendar is a bill of fare; he mea&s;ures the year by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive dain|ties. The only common places of his memo|ry are his meals; and if you a&s;k him at what time an event happened, he con&s;iders whether he heard it after a dinner of turbot, or veni|&s;on. He knows, indeed, that tho&s;e who va|lue them&s;elves upon &s;en&s;e, learning, or piety, &s;peak of him with contempt; but he con&s;iders them as wretches envious or ignorant, who do not know his happine&s;s, or wi&s;h to &s;upplant him, and declares to his friends, that he is fully &s;atisfied with his own conduct, &s;ince he has fed every day on twenty di&s;hes, and yet doubled his e&s;tate.</P>

<P>SUCH is the emptine&s;s of human enjoy|ment, that we are always impatient of the pre&s;ent. Attainment is followed by neg|lect, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by di&s;gu&s;t; and the mali|cious remark of the <HI>Greek</HI> epigrammati&s;t on marriage may be applied to every other cour&s;e of life, that its two days of happine&s;s are the fir&s;t and the la&s;t.</P>
<P>FEW moments are more plea&s;ing than tho&s;e in which the mind is concerting mea&s;ures for a new undertaking. From the fir&s;t hint that wakens the fancy to the hour of actual execu|tion, all is improvement and progre&s;s, tri|umph and felicity. Every hour brings addi|tions to the original &s;cheme, &s;ugge&s;ts &s;ome new expedient to &s;ecure &s;ucce&s;s, or di&s;covers con&s;equential advantages not hitherto fore&s;een. While preparations are made and materials accumulated, day glides after day through ely|&s;ian pro&s;pects, and the heart dances to the &s;ong of hope.</P>
<P>SUCH is the plea&s;ure of projecting, that many content them&s;elves with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="275" REF="276">
vi&s;ionary &s;chemes, and wear out their allotted time in the calm amu&s;ement of contriving what they never attempt or hope to execute.</P>
<P>OTHERS, not able to fea&s;t their imagina|tion with pure ideas, advance &s;omewhat nearer to the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of action, with great diligence collect whatever is requi&s;ite to their de&s;ign, and, after a thou&s;and re&s;earches and con&s;ulta|tions, are &s;natched away by death, as they &s;tand <HI>in procinctu</HI> waiting for a proper oppor|tunity to begin.</P>
<P>IF there were no other end of life, than to find &s;ome adequate &s;olace for every day, I know not whether any condition could be preferred to that of the man who involves him&s;elf in his own thoughts, and never &s;uffers experience to &s;hew him the vanity of &s;peculation; for no &s;ooner are notions reduced to practice, than tranquility and confidence for&s;ake the brea&s;t; every day brings its ta&s;k, and often without bringing abilities to perform it: Difficulties embarra&s;s, uncertainty perplexes, oppo&s;ition retards, cen&s;ure exa&s;perates, or neglect de|pre&s;&s;es. We proceed, becau&s;e we have be|gun; we complete our de&s;ign, that the labour already &s;pent may not be vain: but as expec|tation gradually dies away, the gay &s;mile of
<PB N="276" REF="277">
alacrity di&s;appears, we are nece&s;&s;itated to im|plore &s;everer powers, and tru&s;t the event to patience and con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>WHEN once our labour has begun, the comfort that enables us to endure it is the pro&s;pect of its end; for though in every long work there are &s;ome joyous intervals of &s;elf|applau&s;e, when the attention is recreated by unexpected facility, and the imagination &s;ooth|ed by incidental excellencies not compri&s;ed in the fir&s;t plan, yet the toil with which perform|ance &s;truggles after idea, is &s;o irk&s;ome and di&s;gu&s;ting, and &s;o frequent is the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;ting below that perfection which we ima|gined within our reach, that &s;eldom any man obtains more from his endeavours than a pain|ful conviction of his defects, and a continual re&s;u&s;citation of de&s;ires which he feels him&s;elf unable to gratify.</P>
<P>SO certainly is wearine&s;s and vexation the concomitant of our undertakings, that every man, in whatever he is engaged, con&s;oles him|&s;elf with the hope of change. He that has made his way by a&s;&s;iduity and vigilance to pub|lick employment, talks among his friends of nothing but the delight of retirement: He, whom the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;olitary application &s;e|cludes
<PB N="277" REF="278">
from the world, li&s;tens with a beating heart to its di&s;tant noi&s;es, longs to mingle with living beings, and re&s;olves, when he can regu|late his hours by his own choice, to take his fill of merriment and diver&s;ions, or to di&s;play his abilities on the univer&s;al theatre, and enjoy the plea&s;ure of di&s;tinction and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>EVERY de&s;ire, however innocent or natu|ral, grows dangerous as by long indulgence it becomes a&s;cendent in the mind. When we have been much accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider any thing as capable of giving happine&s;s, it is not ea&s;y to re&s;train our ardour, or to forbear &s;ome precipitation in our advances, and irregularity in our per&s;uits. He that has long cultivated the tree, watched the &s;welling bud, and open|ing blo&s;&s;om, and plea&s;ed him&s;elf with compu|ting how much every &s;un and &s;hower added to its growth, &s;carcely &s;tays till the fruit has ob|tained its maturity, but defeats his own cares by eagerne&s;s to reward them. When we have diligently laboured for any purpo&s;e, we are willing to believe that we have attained it, and, becau&s;e we have already done much, too &s;ud|denly conclude that no more is to be done.</P>
<P>ALL attraction is encrea&s;ed by the approach of the attracting body. We never find our|&s;elves
<PB N="278" REF="279">
&s;o de&s;irous to fini&s;h, as in the latter part of our work, or &s;o impatient of delay, as when we know that delay cannot be long. Part of this un&s;ea&s;onable importunity of di&s;|content may be ju&s;tly imputed to languor and wearine&s;s, which mu&s;t always oppre&s;s us more as our toil has been longer continued; but the greater part u&s;ually proceeds from frequent contemplation of that ea&s;e which we now con&s;ider as near and certain, and which, when it has once flattered our hopes, we can|not &s;uffer to be longer withheld.</P>
<P>THE criticks remark, that in &s;ome of the noble&s;t compo&s;itions of with the conclu&s;ion falls below the vigour and &s;pirit of the fir&s;t books; and as a genius is not to be degraded by the imputation of human failings, the cau&s;e of this declen&s;ion is commonly &s;ought in the &s;tructure of the work, and plau&s;ible rea&s;ons are given why in the defective part le&s;s ornament was nece&s;&s;ary, or le&s;s could be ad|mitted. But, perhaps, if the author had been con&s;ulted, he would have confe&s;&s;ed, that his fancy was tired, and his per&s;everance broken; that he knew his de&s;ign to be unfini&s;hed, but that, when he &s;aw the end &s;o near, he could no longer refu&s;e to be at re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="280">
AGAINST the in&s;tillations of this frigid opiate, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the heart by all the con&s;iderations which once concurred to kindle the ardour of enterpri&s;e. Whatever motive fir&s;t incited action, has &s;till greater force to &s;timulate re&s;olution; &s;ince he that might have lain &s;till at fir&s;t in blamele&s;s ob&s;cu|rity, cannot afterwards de&s;i&s;t but with infamy and reproach. He, whom a doubtful promi&s;e of di&s;tant good, could encourage to &s;et diffi|culties at defiance, ought not to remit his vi|gour, when he has almo&s;t obtained his recom|pence. To faint or loiter, when only the la&s;t efforts are required, is to &s;teer the &s;hip through tempe&s;ts, and abandon it to the winds in &s;ight of land; it is to break the ground and &s;catter the &s;eed, and at la&s;t to neglect the harve&s;t.</P>
<P>THE ma&s;ters of rhetorick direct, that the mo&s;t forcible arguments be produced in the lat|ter part of an oration, le&s;t they &s;hould be ef|faced or perplexed by &s;upervenient images. This precept may be ju&s;tly extended to the &s;eries of life: Nothing is ended with honour, which does not conclude better than it begun. It is not &s;ufficient to maintain the fir&s;t vigour; for excellence lo&s;es its effect upon the mind by cu&s;tom, as light after a time cea&s;es to dazzle.
<PB N="280" REF="281">
Admiration mu&s;t be continued by that novelty which fir&s;t produced it, and how much &s;oever is given, there mu&s;t always be rea&s;on to ima|gine that more remains.</P>
<P>WE not only are naturally mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the la&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, but &s;uch is the unwilling|ne&s;s of mankind to admit &s;upereminent and tran&s;cendent merit, that, though it be difficult to obliterate the reproach of faults or mi&s;car|riages by any &s;ub&s;equent atchievement, how|ever illu&s;trious, or any cour&s;e of virtue, how|ever uniform, yet the reputation, which a long cour&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s has contributed to rai&s;e, may be finally ruined by a &s;ingle failure, for weak|ne&s;s or error will be always remembered by that malice vanity and envy which it gratifies.</P>
<P>FOR the prevention of that di&s;grace, which la&s;&s;itude and negligence may bring at la&s;t upon the greate&s;t performances, it is nece&s;&s;ary to proportion carefully our labour to our &s;trength. If the de&s;ign con&s;i&s;ts of many parts, equally e&s;&s;ential, and therefore not to be &s;eparated, the only time for caution is before we engage; we mu&s;t then impartially e&s;timate our powers, and remember, that not to complete our plan, is not to have begun it; and, that nothing is done, while any thing is omitted.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="282">
BUT if the ta&s;k con&s;i&s;ts in the repetition of &s;ingle acts, no one of which derives its effi|cacy from the re&s;t, it may be attempted with le&s;s &s;cruple, becau&s;e there is always opportu|nity to retreat with honour. The danger is only le&s;t we may expect from the world the indulgence with which mo&s;t are di&s;po&s;ed to treat them&s;elves, and, in the hour of li&s;tle&s;&s;|ne&s;s imagine that the diligence of one day will attone for the idlene&s;s of another, and that applau&s;e begun by approbation will be continued by habit.</P>
<P>HE that is him&s;elf weary, will &s;oon weary the public. Let him therefore lay down his employment, whatever it be, who can no longer exert his former activity or attention; let him not endeavour to &s;truggle with cen|&s;ure, or ob&s;tinately crowd the &s;tage till a ge|neral hi&s;s commands him to depart.</P>

<P>TIME, which puts an end to all human plea&s;ures and &s;orrows, has likewi&s;e con|cluded the labours of the RAMBLER. Having &s;upported for two years the anxious employ|ment of a periodical writer, and multiplied my e&s;&s;ays to &s;ix volumes, I have now deter|mined to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;ons of this re&s;olution it is of lit|tle importance to declare, &s;ince ju&s;tification is unnece&s;&s;ary when no objection is made. I am far from &s;uppo&s;ing, that the ce&s;&s;ation of my performances will rai&s;e any inquiry, for I have never been much a favourite of the publick, nor can boa&s;t that, in the progre&s;s of my un|dertaking, I have been animated by the re|wards of the liberal, the care&s;&s;es of the great, or the prai&s;es of the eminent.</P>
<P>I HAVE however no intention to gratify pride by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, or malice by lamentation; nor think it rea&s;onable to complain of neglect
<PB N="283" REF="284">
from tho&s;e who&s;e regard I never &s;olicited. If I have not been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the di&s;tributers of literary honours, I have &s;eldom de&s;cended to the arts by which favour is obtained. I have &s;een the meteros of fa&s;hion ri&s;e and fall, with|out any attempt to add a moment to their du|ration; I have never complied with temporary curio&s;ity, nor enabled my readers to di&s;cu&s;s the topic of the day; I have rarely exemplified my a&s;&s;ertions by living characters, &s;o that in my papers no man could look either for cen&s;ures of his enemies, or prai&s;es of him&s;elf, and they only were expected to peru&s;e them, who&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions left them lei&s;ure for the contemplation of ab&s;tracted truth, and whom virtue could plea&s;e by her native dignity.</P>
<P>TO &s;ome, however, I am indebted for en|couragement, and to others for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; the number of my friends was never great, but they have been &s;uch as would not &s;uffer me to think that I was writing in vain, and I there|fore felt little dejection from the want of po|pularity.</P>
<P>MY obligations having not been frequent, my acknowledgements may be &s;oon di&s;patched. I can re&s;tore to all my corre&s;pondents their productions, with little diminution of the bulk
<PB N="284" REF="285">
of my volumes, though not without the lo&s;s of &s;ome pieces to which particular honours have been paid.</P>
<P>THE parts from which I claim no other prai&s;e than that of having given them an op|portunity of appearing, are the four billets in the tenth paper, the &s;econd letter in the fif|teenth, the thirtieth, the forty-fourth, the ninety-&s;eventh, and the hundredth papers, and the &s;econd letter in the hundred and &s;eventh.</P>
<P>HAVING thus deprived my&s;elf of many ex|cu&s;es which candor might have admitted for the inequality of my compo&s;itions, being no longer able to allege the nece&s;&s;ity of gratifying corre&s;pondents, the importunity with which publication was &s;olicited, or ob&s;tinacy with which correction was rejected, I mu&s;t remain accountable for all my faults, and &s;ubmit with|out &s;ubterfuge to the cen&s;ures of critici&s;m, which, however, I &s;hall not endeavour to &s;of|ten by a formal deprecation, or to overbear by the influence of a patron. The &s;upplications of an author never yet reprieved him a moment from oblivion; and, though greatne&s;s has &s;ome|times &s;heltered guilt, it can afford no protection to ignorance or dulne&s;s. Having hitherto at|tempted only the propagation of truth, I will
<PB N="285" REF="286">
not at la&s;t violate it by the confe&s;&s;ion of terrors which I do not feel: Having laboured to main|tain the dignity of virtue, I will not now de|grade it by the meanne&s;s of dedication.</P>
<P>THE &s;eeming vanity with which I have &s;ometimes &s;poken of my&s;elf, would perhaps re|quire an apology, were it not extenuated by the example of tho&s;e who have publi&s;hed e&s;&s;ays before me, and by the privilege which a name|le&s;s writer has been hitherto allowed. "A ma&s;k," &s;ays <HI>Ca&s;tiglione,</HI> "confers a right of acting and &s;peaking with le&s;s re&s;traint, even when the wearer happens to be known." He that is di&s;covered without his own con&s;ent, may claim &s;ome indulgence, and cannot be ri|gorou&s;ly called to ju&s;tify tho&s;e &s;allies or frolicks which his di&s;gui&s;e may prove him de&s;irous to conceal.</P>
<P>BUT I have been cautious le&s;t this offence &s;hould be frequently or gro&s;sly committed; for as one of the philo&s;ophers directs us to live with a friend, as with one that is &s;ometime to become an enemy, I have always thought it the duty of an anonymous author to write, if he expected to be hereafter known.</P>
<P>I AM willing to flatter my &s;elf with hopes, that, by collecting the&s;e papers, I am not pre|paring
<PB N="286" REF="287">
for my future life either &s;hame or repen|tance. That all are happily imagined, or ac|curately poli&s;hed, that the &s;ame &s;entiments will not &s;ometimes recur, or the &s;ame expre&s;|&s;ions be too frequently repeated, I have not confidence in my abilities &s;ufficient to promi&s;e. He that condemns him&s;elf to compo&s;e on a &s;tated day, will often bring to his ta&s;k an at|tention di&s;&s;ipated, a memory overwhelmed, an imagination embarra&s;&s;ed, a mind di&s;tracted with anxieties, a body langui&s;hing with di&s;|ea&s;e: He will &s;ometimes labour on a barren topic, till it is too late to change it; and &s;ome|times, in the ardour of invention, diffu&s;e his thoughts into wild exuberance, which the pre&s;&s;ing hour of publication cannot &s;uffer judg|ment to examine or reduce.</P>
<P>WHATEVER &s;hall be the final &s;entence of mankind, I have at lea&s;t endeavoured to de|&s;erve their kindne&s;s. I have laboured to refine our language to grammatical purity, and to clear it from colloquial barbari&s;ms, licentious idioms, and irregular combinations. Some|thing perhaps I have added to the elegance of its con&s;truction, and &s;omething to the har|mony of its cadence. When common words were le&s;s plea&s;ing to the ear or le&s;s di&s;tinct in their &s;ignification, I have familiarized the terms
<PB N="287" REF="288">
of philo&s;ophy by applying them to known objects and popular ideas, but have rarely ad|mitted any word not authorized by former writers; for I believe that whoever knows the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tongue in its pre&s;ent extent, will be able to expre&s;s his thoughts without farther help from other nations.</P>
<P>AS it has been my principal de&s;ign to incul|cate wi&s;dom or piety, I have allotted few pa|pers to the idle &s;ports of imagination; and though &s;ome, perhaps, may be found, of which the highe&s;t excellence is harmle&s;s merriment, yet &s;carcely any man is &s;o &s;teadily &s;erious, as not rather to complain, that the &s;everity of dictatorial in&s;truction is too &s;eldom relieved, and that he has been often driven by the &s;tern|ne&s;s of my philo&s;ophy to more chearful and airy companions.</P>
<P>NEXT to the excur&s;ions of fancy are the di&s;qui&s;itions of critici&s;m, which, in my opinion, is only to be ranked among the &s;ubordinate and in&s;trumental arts. Arbitrary deci&s;ion and general exclamation I have carefully avoided by a&s;&s;erting nothing without a rea&s;on, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hing all my principles of judgment on un|alterable and evident truth.</P>
<P>IN the pictures of life I have never been &s;o &s;tudious of novelty or &s;urprize, as to depart
<PB N="288" REF="289">
wholly from all re&s;emblance; a fault which writers de&s;ervedly celebrated frequently com|mit, that they may rai&s;e, as the occa&s;ion re|quires, either mirth or abhorrence. Some en|largement may be allowed to declamation, and &s;ome exaggeration to burle&s;que; but as they deviate farther from reality they become le&s;s u&s;eful, becau&s;e their le&s;&s;ons will fail of ap|plication. The mind of the reader is carried away from the contemplation of his own man|ners; he finds in him&s;elf no likene&s;s to the phantom before him, and though he laughs or rages is not reformed.</P>
<P>THE e&s;&s;ays profe&s;&s;edly &s;erious, if I have been able to execute my own intentions, will be found exactly conformable to the precepts of chri&s;tianity, without any accommodation to the licentiou&s;ne&s;s and levity of the pre&s;ent age. I therefore look back on this part of my work with plea&s;ure, which no blame or prai&s;e of man &s;hall dimini&s;h or augment; I &s;hall never envy the honours which wit and learning ob|tain in any other cau&s;e, if I can be numbered among the writers, who have given ardour to virtue, and confidence to truth.</P>
