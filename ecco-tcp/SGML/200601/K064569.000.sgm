make a Dedication of this
Di&s;cour&s;e to your <HI>Lord&s;hip,</HI>

expecting &s;oon to hear of your
Approbation or Di&s;like of it. If it
&s;o happen, that you highly approve
of it, I beg of you to be &s;paring of
your Commendations, lea&s;t I &s;hould be
puff'd up with them.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3" MS="y">
In my <HI>Moderator,</HI> &s;ome Expre&s;|&s;ions
dropt from ny Pen about the
Miracles of our Saviour, which, for
want of Illu&s;tration then, gave your
<HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> &s;ome offence, and brought
upon me more Trouble: But, having
now fully and clearly explain'd my &s;elf
out of the Fathers, I hope you'll be
reconciled to me; and as you are a
Lover of Truth, will, again&s;t Intere&s;t
and Prejndice, yield to the Force
of it.</P>
<P>Whether your Pro&s;ecution of me,
for the <HI>Moderator,</HI> was ju&s;t and rea|&s;onable,
I'll not di&s;pute here, having
already expo&s;tulated that matter with
you, in &s;everal Letters, to which you
would not conde&s;cend to give me any
An&s;wer. For what Rea&s;on you was
&s;ilent is be&s;t known to your &s;elf. But
in my own Vindication, I hope, I
muy publi&s;h without Offence, that your
taking me for an <HI>Infidel</HI> was &s;uch a
Mi&s;take, as I thought no <HI>Schoar</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="4">
could have made; and the Injury done
to my Reputation and low Fortunes,
by the Pro&s;ecution, &s;o con&s;iderable, that
the lea&s;t I expected from your <HI>Lord|&s;hip</HI>
was a courteous Excu&s;e, if not an
ample Compen&s;ation for it.</P>
<P>As to the Expediency of pro&s;ecuting
<HI>Infidels</HI> for their writings (in who&s;e
Cau&s;e I am the farthe&s;t of any Man
from being engaged) I will here &s;ay
nothing. The Argument, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI>
has already, by one or other, been co|piou&s;ly
handled. And I don't know,
but I might be, with your <HI>Lord&s;hip,</HI>
on the per&s;ecuting &s;ide of the Que&s;tion;
but that it looks, as if a Man was
di&s;tru&s;tful of the Truth of Chri&s;tianity,
and con&s;cious of his own Inability to
defend it; or he would leave that good
Cau&s;e to God him&s;elf, and the Sword
of the Spirit, without calling upon
the <HI>Civil Magi&s;trate,</HI> for his Aid and
A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">
That Scurvy <HI>Writer</HI> of the <HI>Scheme

<HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> mu&s;t have heard of, would

<HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> who, for fear of their In|tere&s;ts
in the Church, &s;et Per&s;ecutions
on foot: But after your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> has
publi&s;h'd a Strenuous Defence of
Chri&s;tianity to the Purpo&s;e of our pre|&s;ent
Controver&s;y, I'll have no &s;uch
&s;u&s;picions of you.</P>
<P>Your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI>'s per&s;ecuting (or if
you will pro&s;ecuting) Humour is re|putedly
all pure Zeal for God's Glory;
and, with all my Heart, let it be &s;o
accounted, whether it be according to
Knowledge or not. Again&s;t Popery
and Infidelity you are all Ardency!
Who do's not commend you? Who can
que&s;tion the &s;incerity of the Zeal of a
Prote&s;tant <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> and of a Pro&s;te&s;tant
<HI>Clergy,</HI> when they per&s;ecute the Ene|mys

of the Integrity of their Hearts, or I
know not where to find one.</P>
<P>But that your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI>'s Zeal for
Religion is very remarkable and &s;uc|ce&s;sful,

<HEAD>A
DISCOURSE
On the
MIRACLES of our SAVIOUR, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IF ever there was an u&s;eful
Controver&s;y &s;tarted, or re|vived
in this Age of the
Church, it is <HI>this</HI> about the
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip</HI> of the Holy Je&s;us,
which the <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e of the
Grounds,</HI> &amp;c. has of late rais'd. I be|leive
this Controver&s;y will end in the
ab&s;olute Demon&s;tration of Je&s;us's <HI>Me&s;&s;iah|&s;hip</HI>
from Prophecy, which is the only
way to prove him to be the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> that
great Prophet expected by the <HI>Jews,</HI> and
promi&s;ed under the Old Te&s;tament. And
tho' this way of Proof from Prophecy &s;eems
to labour under many Difficulties at pre&s;ent,
and tho' &s;ome <HI>Writers</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Grounds,</HI>
being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e Difficulties, are
fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2+ letters">eeking Refuge in the Miracles of our
<PB N="2" REF="9">
Saviour; yet we mu&s;t per&s;i&s;t in it, till what
I have no doubt of, his <HI>Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip</HI> &s;hall be
clearly made out by it.</P>
<P>And the way in Prophecy, that I would
take for the Proof of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s <HI>Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip</HI>
&s;hould be by an Allegorical Interpretation,
and Application of the Law and the Pro|phets
to him; the very &s;ame Way, that all
the Fathers of the Church have gone in;
and the very &s;ame Way, in which all the
Ancient <HI>Jews</HI> &s;ay their <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was to ful|fil
the Law and the Prophets: But this
Way does not plea&s;e our Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Writ|ers</HI>
in this Controver&s;y, neither will they
at pre&s;ent give any Ear to it.</P>
<P>The Way in Prophecy, that they are for
taking is by a Litteral Interpretation and Ap|plcation
of &s;ome Prophecys of the Old Te&s;ta|ment
to our <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> but they are hitherto un|&s;ucce&s;sful
in this Way. The Authors of the
<HI>Grounds</HI> and of the <HI>Scheme</HI> grievou&s;ly perplex
them with their Objections again&s;t this Way
of Proof, &s;o far as, being &s;en&s;ible, I &s;ay, of
almo&s;t in&s;uperable Difficultys in it, they are
flying apace to the Miracles of our Saviour,
as to their &s;ole and grand Refuge.</P>
<P>But to &s;how, that there's no Sanctuary
for them in the Miracles of our Saviour, I
write this Di&s;cour&s;e: And this I do, not
for the &s;ervice of Infidelity, which has no
Place in my Heart; but for the honour of
<PB N="3" REF="10">
the Holy <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and to reduce the <HI>Clergy</HI>
to the good old way of interpreting Pro|phecys,
which the Church has unhappily
apo&s;tatis'd from, and which, upon the
Te&s;timony of the Fathers, will, one Day.
be the Conver&s;ion of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>For this Opinion, that there is no Sanctu|ary
in the Miracles of our Saviour, I chanc'd
to &s;ay in the <HI>Moderator,</HI> <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Page 44.</NOTE> <HI>That Je&s;us's Mi|racles,
as they are now a days under&s;tood, make
nothing for his Authority and Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip</HI>; and
again, <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">p. 53.</NOTE> <HI>that I believe upon good Authority,
&s;ome of the Miracles of Je&s;us, as recorded by
the Evangeli&s;ts were never wrought, but are
only related as Prophetical and Parabolical
Narratives of what will be my&s;teriou&s;ly and
more wonderfully done by him:</HI> Which ex|pre&s;&s;ions
gave offence to &s;ome of our <HI>Clergy,</HI>
and brought upon me their Indignation and
Di&s;plea&s;ure. I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to depart
from the &s;aid Expre&s;&s;ions, or &s;o much as
to palliate and &s;often them, much le&s;s to
retract them; but in maintenance of my
Opinion, to the Honour of our <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and
and the Defence of Chri&s;tianity, I write
this Treati&s;e on Je&s;us's Miracles, and take
this method following.</P>
<P N="1">I. I will &s;how, that the Miracles of Heal|ing
all manner of Bodily Di&s;ea&s;es, which
<PB N="4" REF="11">
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> was ju&s;tly famed for, are none of the
proper Miracles of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> neither are
they &s;o much as a good Proof of his Divine
Authority to found a Religion.</P>
<P N="2">II. That the litteral Hi&s;tory of many of
the Miracles of Je&s;us, as recorded by the
Evangeli&s;ts, does imply Ab&s;urditys, Impro|babilities
and Incredibilitys, con&s;equently,
they, either in whole or in part, were ne|ver
wrought, as they are commonly believed
now a days, but are only related as Pro|phetical
and Parabolical Naratives of what
would be my&s;teriou&s;ly and more wonderful|ly
done by him.</P>
<P N="3">III. I &s;hall con&s;ider what Je&s;us means,
when he appeals to his Miracles as to a
Te&s;timony and Witne&s;s of his Divine Au|thority,
and &s;how, that he could not pro|perly
and ultimately referr to tho&s;e, he then
wrought in the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> but to tho&s;e My&s;tical
ones, which he would do in the <HI>Spirit</HI>; of
which tho&s;e wrought in the Fle&s;h are but
mere Types and Shadows.</P>
<P>In treating on the&s;e Heads, I &s;hall not
confine my &s;elf only to Rea&s;on, but al&s;o to
the expre&s;s Authority of the Fathers, tho&s;e
holy, venerable and learned Preachers of
he Go&s;pel in the fir&s;t Ages of the Church,
who took our Religion from the Hands
<PB N="5" REF="12">
of the Apo&s;tles and of Apo&s;tolical Men,
who dy'd, &s;ome of them, and &s;uffer'd for
the Doctrine they taught; who profe&s;&s;edly
and confe&s;&s;edly were endew'd with Divine
and Extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit; who
con&s;equently can't be &s;uppo&s;ed to be cor|rupters
of Chri&s;tianity, or teachers of fal&s;e
Notions about the Miracles of our Saviour,
of &s;o much as mi&s;taken about the Apo&s;to|lical
and Evangelical Sen&s;e and Nature of
them. I know not how it comes to pa&s;s,
but I am a profound Admirer and an almo&s;t
implicit Believer of the Authority of the
Fathers, whom I look upon as va&s;t Philo|&s;ophres,
very great Scholars, and mo&s;t Or|thodox
Divines. Whatever they concur|rently
a&s;&s;ert, I firmly believe. And tho'
they are, for the mo&s;t part, my&s;terious
Writers out of the Reach of the Capacitys
of many, who &s;light them; yet I, who have
had the Honour and Happine&s;s of much of
their Acquaintance, fancy my &s;elf well ap|pri&s;ed
of their meanings. If at any time
I read a Pa&s;&s;age in them, which I don't pre|&s;ently
apprehend, I &s;alute it with Venera|tion
for all that; till my Under&s;tanding is
open'd to receive the &s;en&s;e of it. If I meet
with but a &s;ingle Opinion in any one of
them, I pay my Re&s;pects to it; but where
there is an Harmony and Agreement of O|pinion
among&s;t them, it is with me and
<PB N="6" REF="13">
ought to be with all Chri&s;tians, of &s;uch
Weight as to bear down all Prejudice,
Oppo&s;ition, and Contradiction before it; or
the Authority of no Man, whether Anci|ent
or Modern is to have any Regard paid
to it; and of what ill Con&s;equence to Re|ligion
&s;uch an utter Rejection of Authori|ty
will be, I need not &s;ay.</P>
<P>This I thought fit to premi&s;e, concer|ning
the Authority of the Fathers, to abate
of the Prejudice beforehand, which &s;ome
may conceive again&s;t the following Di&s;|cour&s;e
about the Miracles of <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> I don't
que&s;tion, but &s;ome may be &s;tartled at the
foregoing Heads, as if, what is the farthe&s;t
of any thing from my Heart, the &s;ervice
of Infidelity was in View; but craving
the Temper and Patience of &s;uch Readers
for a while, and they &s;hall find, that it's no
other than ju&s;t Rea&s;oning, clear Truth, and
Primitive Doctrine about <HI>Je&s;us's</HI> Miracles,
that I advance; or if it &s;hould &s;o happen,
that none be&s;ides my &s;elf &s;hould di&s;cern the
Rea&s;oning and Truth of the Argument;
yet I hope it will not be thought a Crime
to revive Primitive Doctrine, which none
will be able to deny it to be, whether they
like it or not. If I err, I err upon Choice
with the Fathers, of who&s;e Faith I am.
And if any are offended at what follows
about the Miracles of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> let them turn
<PB N="7" REF="14">
their Di&s;plea&s;ure and Indignation again&s;t the
Fathers, for who&s;e expre&s;s or implicit O|pinions
I can be de&s;erving of no Blame.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for the occa&s;ion of &s;uch a
Preface again&s;t Offence, which the Apo&s;tacy
of the Age, and its Unacquaintedne&s;s with
the Fathers has made nece&s;&s;ary. So I enter
upon the particular Handling of the Heads
foregoing. And</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>I. I will &s;how that the Miracles of Heal|ing
all manner of Bodily Di&s;ea&s;es, which
<HI>Je&s;us</HI> was ju&s;tly famed for; are none of the
proper Miracles of the Me&s;&s;iah, nor are
they &s;o much as a good Proof of <HI>Je&s;us's</HI>
Divine Authority to found and introduce
a Religion into the World.</P>
<P>And to do this, let us con&s;ider fir&s;t in
general, what was the Opinion, of the Fa|thers
about the Writings of the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI>
in which the Life of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is recorded.
<HI>Eucherius</HI> &s;ays, <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Univer&s;am porro Sacram Scripturam tam Novi quam Veteris Te&s;tamenti ad allegoricum &s;en&s;um e&s;&s;e &s;umendam, admonet nos vel illud, Aperiam os meum in Parabolis. <HI>In Pra&s;at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> ad Form. Spirit Intell.</HI></NOTE> <HI>That the Scriptures of the
New as well as Old Te&s;tament are to be in|terpreted
in an Allegorical Sen&s;e.</HI> And this
his Opinion, is no other, than the common
one of the fir&s;t Ages of the Church, as
might be proved by many the like Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="8" REF="15">
of other Fathers. As in &s;uch Ex|pre&s;&s;ions,
they do not except the Writings
of the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI>; &s;o they mu&s;t include the
Hi&s;tory of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Miracles, which as well
as other Parts of the Hy&s;tory of his Life is
to be allegoriz'd for the &s;ake of its true
meaning; con&s;equently the litteral Story of
Chri&s;t's Miracles proves nothing.</P>
<P>But let's hear particularly their Opinion
of the Actions and Miracles of our Saviour.
<HI>Origen</HI> &s;ays, that <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Si quidem Symbola quaedam erant quae tunc ge|rebantur eorum, quae Je&s;u virtute &s;emper preficiun|tur. <HI>In</HI> Mat. <HI>C.</HI> xv.</NOTE> <HI>what&s;oever Je&s;us did in
the Fle&s;h, was but Typical and Symbolical of
what he would do in the Spirit</HI>; and to our
Purpo&s;e, <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Omnis languor &amp; omnis Infirmitas quam &s;an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">avit &s;alvator tunc in Populo referuntur ad Infirmitates &s;pi|rituals Animarum, <HI>&amp;c. In</HI> Mat. <HI>C.</HI> xvii.</NOTE> that <HI>the &s;everal bodily Di&s;ea&s;es
which he heal'd, were no other than Figures of
the &s;piritual Infirmities of the Soul, that are

Mind with <HI>Origen,</HI> as any one may &s;ee by

the Works of Je&s;us import farther My&s;teries;
and with them, the re&s;t of the Fathers agree,
making the Miracles, that Je&s;us did then,
no more than the Shadow of &s;ome more
powerful and my&s;tical Operations to be done
by him; as I could &s;how by more Citati|ons
out of them, if it was needful. But
from the foregoing Citations out of the Fa|thers
it is plain, in their Opinion, that our
modern <HI>Divines</HI> are in the wrong of it to
lay much Stre&s;s on any of the Operations
of Je&s;us, which he did in the Fle&s;h, for the
Proof of his Divine Authority and <HI>Me&s;&s;iah|&s;hip,</HI>
which is only to be proved by his
more my&s;terious Works, of which tho&s;e
done in the Fle&s;h were but Type and Fi|gure.</P>
<P>But to come clo&s;er to the Purpo&s;e, let's
&s;ee how indifferently, I had almo&s;t &s;aid con|temptibly,
the Fathers &s;peak of the Miracles
of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and particularly of his Power of
Healing all bodily Di&s;ea&s;es, which by mo|dern
<HI>Writers</HI> is &s;o much magnified and ex|toll'd.
St. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> &s;ays, <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Si enim temporalis erat ab eo Utilitas, nihil grande prae&s;titit iis, qui ab eo curati &s;unt, <HI>L.V.</HI> c. 12. <HI>S.</HI> 6.</NOTE> that if <HI>we con&s;i|der

con&s;equently <HI>Irenaeus</HI> could not hold,
that Je&s;us's Miracles then wrought, were
a &s;ufficient Proof of his Divine Authority
much le&s;s of his <HI>Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip. Origen</HI> &s;ays, <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">Contra Cel&s;um, <HI>L.</HI> 11.</NOTE> that <HI>tho' many were brought to believe in

the in&s;ufficiency of them for the Conver&s;ion
of Men) <HI>he intimates that his greater and my|&s;tical
Works do prove his Authority.</HI> St. <HI>John</HI> of
<HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;ays, <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">Coecum curavit magnum quidem e&s;t, quod fe|cit, &s;ed ni&s;i quotidie fiat, quod olim factum, nobis quidem magnum e&s;&s;e ce&s;&s;avit, <HI>Homil.</HI> 30. <HI>in</HI> Marc. 9.</NOTE> that <HI>Je&s;us's cures per|form'd

<HI>Anti-chri&s;t</HI> will imitate and equal <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in

How then can we di&s;tingui&s;h the true Pro|phet

Hi&s;tory affords us In&s;tances of Men, &s;uch as
of <HI>Apollonius Tyanaeus, Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> and of the

conceive, we ought not to give heed to

<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="21">
1. That be&s;ides Greatne&s;s of Power, there
was nothing but Goodne&s;s, Kindne&s;s, and
Love to Man-kind &s;hewn in <HI>Jefus's</HI> Miracles.
As to the Miracles of fal&s;e Prophets and
Impo&s;tors, if they be, many of them, of a
kind and benevolent A&s;pect, yet the <HI>Devil's</HI>
Foot, if we look well to it, will di&s;cover it
&s;elf in &s;ome ludicrous and mi&s;cheivous

beneficent Nature, He went about doing
good, healing all manner of Di&s;ea&s;es among
the People, and did no wrong to any one;
which is a good Argument they &s;ay, of
his Divine Authority, or God would not
have &s;uffer'd, nor the Devil have work'd
&s;uch a Te&s;timony in behalf of it. On
this Head our <HI>Divines</HI> are copious and
rhetorical, and many notable and florid
Harangues have they made on it. But</P>
<P>In An&s;wer to them, they don't &s;eem to
have their Memories at Hand, when they
declaim at this Rate. The Fathers, upon
who&s;e Authority I write, will tell &s;uch
Orators, that <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> if his Miracles are to
be under&s;tood in the litteral &s;ence, did not
only as fooli&s;h Things, as any Impo&s;tor
could do, but very injurious ones to Man|kind.
I &s;hall not here in&s;tance in the
&s;eemingly fooli&s;h and injurious things which
Je&s;us did for Miracles, intending under the
<PB N="15" REF="22">
next Head to &s;peak to &s;ome of them. But
they are &s;uch, if litterally true, as out
Divines do believe, as are enough to turn
our &s;tomachs again&s;t &s;uch a Prophet; and
enough to make us take him for a <HI>Conjuror,</HI>
a <HI>Sorcerer</HI> and a <HI>Wizard</HI> rather, than the
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> and Prophet of the mo&s;t High
God. But</P>
<P N="2">2. To prove the Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip of the
Holy Je&s;us from his Miracles, our <HI>Divines</HI>
urge the Prophecys of the Old Te&s;tament,
&s;uch as that of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> C. XXXV. v. 5, 6.
<HI>Then the Eyes of the blind &s;hall be opened,
and the Ears of the Deaf &s;hall be un&s;topp'd,
then &s;hall the lame Man leap as the Hart,
and the Tongue of the Dumb &s;ing</HI>; and &s;ay
that the&s;e Prophecys were accurately ful|fill'd
by our <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in the &s;everal &s;pecifical
Cures of Blindne&s;s, Deafne&s;s, Lamene&s;s
and Dumbne&s;s, which he often perform'd
upon one or other; and, in a&s;much as
our Saviour &s;eems to appeal to &s;uch Pro|phecys,
do conclude this his Accompli&s;h|ment
of them to be no le&s;s than a De|mon&s;tration,
that he was the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI>
that great Prophet, who was to came in|to
the World. To which I an&s;wer,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the Accompli&s;hment of
Prophecys that can neither be given forth
by human Fore&s;ight, nor fulfill'd in a
Counterfeit, are good Proofs of <HI>Je&s;us's</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="23"><HI>Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip</HI>; But then, what &s;hall we &s;ay
if others be&s;ides <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;hould do the like
Cures and Miracles? It is &s;aid of <HI>An|tichri&s;t,</HI>
and I believe it, that he will
not only, do all the Miracles, that Je&s;us
did, but will appeal to the like Prophecys
too. How then we are to di&s;tingui&s;h the
true Chri&s;t from the fal&s;e Chri&s;t by Mi|racles
and Prophecys in this Ca&s;e, is the
Que&s;tion, which I leave with our Divines
to con&s;ider of an An&s;wer to, again&s;t the
Time, that it is proved that <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI>
does all tho&s;e Miracles, which <HI>Je&s;us</HI> in the
Fle&s;h wrought. But</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The fore&s;aid Prophecys and
others mention'd in <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> neither were,
nor could be Prophecys of the miraculous
Cures of bodily Di&s;ea&s;es which Je&s;us <HI>then</HI>
did. And this may be made appear not
only from the Context of tho&s;e Prophecy's,
which received then no Accompli&s;hment
from <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who ought to have fulfill'd one
Part of the Prophecy as well as the other,
or is not to be taken for the Fulfiller of
either; bur from the Opinion of both <HI>Jews</HI>
and <HI>Fathers,</HI> who adjourn the Accompli&s;h|ment
of tho&s;e Prophecys to Chri&s;t's Spi|ritual
Advent; But</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI> The Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> in the Place
above cited, &s;peaks not of bodily Blind|ne&s;&s;
which the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> is to heal, but of

the &s;piritual Di&s;tempers of the Soul, me|taphorically

<P>II. I &s;hall prove, that the litteral Story

and Incredibilities and the
gro&s;&s;e&s;t Ab&s;uidities, very di&s;honourable to
the Name of Chri&s;t; con&s;equently, they,
in Whole or in Part, were never wrought,
but are only related as Prophetical and Para|bolical

<P>St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> as his manner is in other

<P>La&s;tly with the foregoing Fathers agrees
St. <HI>Theophylact,</HI> who is, an Allegori&s;t too
upon this Miracle, &s;aying that tho&s;e, <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">. <HI>In Johan.</HI> C. ii.</NOTE> 
who &s;ell Doves, are the Prie&s;ts, who &s;ell
Spiritual Gifts, and that Chri&s;t &s;ometime
or other would overturn their Seats, and
clear his Church of them. In another Place
he intimates, what are meant by Oxen
and Sheep, <HI>viz.</HI> the litteral Sence of the
Scriptures. And if the litteral Sence be
irrational and non&s;en&s;ical, the Metaphor we
mu&s;t allow to be proper, in as much as
now-a-days, dull and fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd
&s;tuff we call Bulls, Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">lings and Blunders.</P>
<P>Behold a wonderful Harmony among the
Fathers in their Rejection of litteral
and e&s;pou&s;al of the my&s;tical Sen&s;e of this
Miracle. It is &s;aid of the Church in her fir&s;t
Ages, that &s;he was in&s;pir'd; and &s;o &s;he
was, or, before an Hire for the Prie&s;t|hood
was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and pleaded for, &s;he
could never have written in this fa&s;hion.
If the Fathers had lived now, and written
thus, we &s;hould have thought the Spirit
of <HI>Quakeri&s;m</HI> was gotten among&s;t them,
or they would never have given &s;uch an Ex|po&s;ition
<PB N="28" REF="35">
of this Story of favour an Enmity
to an Hireling Prie&s;thood.</P>
<P>How and when Chri&s;'sts Power according
to the Figure and Parable before us, will
enter his Church, and drive out of her the&s;e
Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Merchants, is not the Que&s;tion.
But when ever it dos &s;o effectually, it will
be a &s;tupendous Miracle, Much greater
than the Typical one is &s;uppo&s;ed to be,
and not only a Proof of Chri&s;t's divine
Power and Pre&s;ence in his Church, but an
ab&s;olute Demon&s;tration of his <HI>Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip,</HI>
from his Accompli&s;hment both of the fore|&s;aid
Prophecys of the Fathers, and of other
remarkable Ones of the Old Te&s;tament,
which will be then clearly under&s;tood, and
which it is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s here to apply
or mention.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the afore&s;aid Expo&s;ition of this
Miracle perhaps it may be Objected, that
(excepting a little Rea&s;oning again&s;t the
Letter of it) this is only the chimerical and
whim&s;ical Dream of the Fathers, who&s;e
Notions are ob&s;olete, and who <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot">Chandler's Vindication, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 145.</NOTE> <HI>have
adulterated Chri&s;tianity with their Cant and
Jargan,</HI> and that none of our Prote&s;tant and
Orthodox <HI>Divines</HI> have ever given into their Opinion.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, that that none of our Prote&s;tant
<HI>Divines,</HI> whom I know, do embrace the
<PB N="29" REF="36">
fore&s;aid Expo&s;ition of the Fathers, but it
may be nothing the wor&s;e for all that:
And tho' their Expo&s;ition may be very
di&s;agreeable to the Prie&s;thood of this Age;
yet I can tell them of the greate&s;t Man
of the&s;e la&s;t Ages, and that was <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI>
who, cautiou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf for fear
of giving Offence to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> is of the
&s;ame Mind with the Fathers; or he would
not &s;ay that <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">Hoc facto longe aliud &s;ignificabat Je&s;us, nec enim illum tantopere commovebat Templum illud mercimoniis Boum, Ovium, Hircorum et Colum|barum profanatum; &s;ed oftendere voluit Avaritiam et Quae&s;tum fore capitalem Pe&s;tem Eccle&s;iae, quam Templum, cujus Religio mox erat abolenda, figura|bat&mdash;In nullum Hominum Genus acrius &s;aeviit Je|&s;us, &s;ed hos ip&s;e &s;ibi &s;ervavit ejiciendos, cum videbi|tur. <HI>In Loc.

de&s;troy'd but meant to &s;hew his di&s;like and
hatred of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Covetou&s;ne&s;s, which,
after the Way of the Type, he would take his
Opportunity to rid the Church of.</HI></P>
<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s this Miracle I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve,
that if the Fathers are right above,
then out <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Tran&s;lations
of the place in St. <HI>Matthew</HI> err in a main
Point. In&s;tead of reading, <HI>and Je&s;us ca&s;t
out them, that &s;old and bought,</HI> it &s;hould be,
<PB N="30" REF="37">
<HI>tho&s;e who &s;old and preach'd,</HI> that is, &s;old
what they preach'd. For the Word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
do's more properly &s;ignifie to <HI>preach</HI> than
to <HI>buy</HI>; and in this &s;en&s;e here, according
to the Fathers, it &s;hould be con&s;trued.</P>
<P>Again, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that our Com|mentators
are a little perplex'd to know
who and what tho&s;e <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Money-Changers</HI>
were. The Greek <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">Vid. Suicerum in <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> Word dos
import tho&s;e who have a Knack to barter
away little ba&s;e and bra&s;s Money, with the
Effigies of an Ox or Bull on it, in Ex|change
for good Coin. How applicable
the Word was to any Merchants of the
old Temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> is hard to con|ceive.
But it is very agreeable to our
Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Collybi&s;ts,</HI> who, as I may ap|peal
to Freethinkers, vend their bra&s;en|faced
Bulls and Blunders at an extravagant
and great Price. And if <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> which is

<HI>Pulpits,</HI> who can help it?</P>
<P>So much then on the Miracle of Je&s;us's
driving the Sellersand Buyers out of the
Temple. And now I appeal to our <HI>Di|vines,</HI>
whether it be not an ab&s;urd, im|probable,
and incredible Story according
to the Letter, and whether it be any other,
<PB N="31" REF="38">
than, as the Fathers &s;aid of it, a prophe|tical
and parabolical Narative of what
would be my&s;teriou&s;ly and more wonder|fully
done by Je&s;us. And &s;o I come to
&s;peak to a</P>
<P N="2">2. Second Miracle of Je&s;us, and that is, that
of his <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">Matt. C. viii. Mark C. v. Luke C. viii.</NOTE> <HI>casting the Devils out of the Mad|man
or Madmen, and permitting them to
enter into the Herd of Swine, which thereupon
ran down a Precipice and were all choaked
in the Sea.</HI></P>
<P>To exorci&s;e or ca&s;t Devils out of the
Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, without con&s;idering the Nature
of &s;uch a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or the Nature and
Power of the Devil, we'll allow to be not
only a kind and beneficent Act, but a
great Miracle. But then, be the Miracle
as great as can be imagin'd, it is no more,
than what fal&s;e Teachers, <NOTE N="43" PLACE="foot">Luke C. xiii. v. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Workers of
Iniquity,</HI> and even &s;ome Arti&s;ts among&s;t
the <HI>Jews</HI> have before done, con&s;equently
&s;uch a Work of <HI>Exorci&s;m</HI> in our Saviour
could be no Proof of his Divine Autho|rity.
And if there was no more to be
&s;aid again&s;t this Miracle; this is enough
to &s;et it a&s;ide, and to &s;poil the Argument
of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Divine Power from it. But
there are many Circum&s;tances in the Story
<PB N="32" REF="39">
litterally con&s;ider'd, that would induce us
to call the Truth of the Whole into Que&s;tion.
How came tho&s;e Madmen to have their
dwelling among&s;t the Tombs of a Burying
Ground? where was the Humanity of the
People, that did not take Care of them
in Pitty to them, as well as for the Safety
of others? Or if no Chains, as the Text
&s;ays, which is hardly credible, could hold
them, it was po&s;&s;ible &s;urely as well as law|full
to di&s;patch them, rather than their
Neighbours and Pa&s;&s;engers &s;hould be in
Danger from them. Believe then this Part
of the Story who can? But what's wor&s;e,
its not credible, there was any Herd of
<HI>Swine</HI> in that Country. If any Hi&s;torians
but the <HI>Evangili&s;ts</HI> has &s;aid &s;o, none would
have believed it. The <HI>Jews</HI> are forbidden
to eat Swines Fle&s;h; what then &s;hould they
do with Swine which are good for nothing
till they are dead) who eat neither Pigg,
Pork nor Bacon? Some may &s;ay that they
were kept there for the U&s;e of Strangers:
But this could not be; becau&s;e that after
the Time of <HI>Antiochus,</HI> who polluted the
Temple with the Sacrifice of an Hog, the
<HI>Jews</HI> <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">Spencer. de Legibus Hebrae.p.117.</NOTE> forbid, under the Pain of an
<HI>Anathema,</HI> the keeping of any Swine in their
Country. Perhaps is may be &s;aid, that
<PB N="33" REF="40">
the <HI>Gadarens,</HI> &s;o call'd from the Place of
their Abode, were not <HI>Jews</HI> but neighbou|ring
<HI>Gentiles,</HI> with whom it was lawful to
eat, and keep <HI>Swine.</HI> We will &s;uppo&s;e &s;o,
tho' it is improbable; but then, it's unlike|ly
(without better Rea&s;on than at pre&s;ent
we are appri&s;ed of) that our Saviour would
permit the Devils to enter into a Herd of
them to their De&s;truction. Where was
the Goodne&s;s and Ju&s;tice of his &s;o doing?
Let our <HI>Divines</HI> account for it, if they can.
It is commonly &s;aid of our Saviour, and I
believe it, that his Life was entirely Inno|cent,
that his Miracles were all u&s;eful and
beneficial to Maniind, and that he did no
Wrong to any one. But how can this be
rightly &s;aid of him, if this Story be litte|rally
true? The Proprietors of the Swine
were great Lo&s;ers and Sufferers; and we
don't read that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> make them amends,
or that they de&s;erv'd &s;uch U&s;age from him.
The Proprietors of the Swine, it &s;eems, up|on
this Damage done them by <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> de|&s;ire
him to depart out of their Coa&s;ts, to pre|vent
farther Mi&s;chief, which was gentler
Re&s;entment, than we can imagine any o|thers
would have made of the like Injury.
I know not what our Divines think of this
Part of the Story, nor wherefore Je&s;us
e&s;caped &s;o well; but if any <HI>Exorci&s;t</HI> in this
our Age and Nation had pretended to ex|pel
<PB N="34" REF="41">
the Devil out of one po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and per|mitted
him to enter into a Flock of Sheep,
the People would have &s;aid, that he had
bewitch'd both; and our Laws and Judges
too of the la&s;t Age, would have made him
to &s;wing for it.</P>
<P>Without Offence, I hope, I have argued
again&s;t the Letter of this &s;trange Story of
the Holy Je&s;us; I &s;hould not have dared
to have &s;aid &s;o much again&s;t it, but upon
the Encouragement of <HI>Origen</HI> and other Fa|thers,
who &s;ay, we ought to expo&s;e the Ab|surdities
of the Letter, as much as may
be, to turn Men's Heads to the my&s;tical and
true meaning.</P>
<P>Let's hear then, what the Fathers &s;ay to
this Miracle. <HI>Origen</HI>'s Commentaries on
this Part of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> and St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s
Go&s;pel are lo&s;t; otherwi&s;e unque&s;tionably
he would not only have told us, that he
believed no more of the Letter of this Sto|ry,
than he did of the Devil's <NOTE N="45" PLACE="foot">L. IV. <HI>De Principiis.</HI></NOTE> taking
our Saviour to the Top of a Mountain,
and &s;hewing him all the Kingdoms of the
World; but, as he is an admirable <HI>My|&s;ti&s;t,</HI>
would have given us curious Light
into the Allegory and My&s;tery of it. But

What &s;ort of <HI>Hereticks</HI> are meant, or whe|ther

But one would be apt to think that <HI>Mini|&s;ters

a Nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uch an Interpretation to
make the Story credible.</P>
<P>And thus have I given you the Opinion
and Expo&s;ition of the Fathers upon this
Miracle, which they turn all into My&s;tery.
If our <HI>Divines</HI> are &s;till for adhering to the
Letter of this Story, let them Account for
the Difficulties, it is involv'd with. To
cure Men violently di&s;tracted, and po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd
with <HI>Devils</HI> is, whether it be mira|culous
or not, a good and great Work;
but to &s;end the <HI>Devils,</HI> who without <HI>Je|&s;us</HI>'s
Permi&s;&s;ion could not go, into the
<HI>Herd of Swine,</HI> was an Injury done to the
Proprietors, and unbecoming of the Good|ne&s;s
of the Holy Je&s;us. Neither is there
any other Way to &s;olve the Difficulty,
than by looking upon the Whole, with
the Fathers, as Type and Figure.</P>
<P>If this Miraculous Story had been re|corded
of <HI>Mahomet</HI> and not of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>; our
<HI>Divines,</HI> I dare &s;ay, would have work'd
it up to a Confutation, of <HI>Mahometani&s;m.
Mahomet</HI> &s;hould have been, with them,
nothing le&s;s than a Wizard, an Enchanter,
a dealer with familiar Spirits, a &s;worn &s;lave
to the Devil; and his <HI>Mu&s;&s;ulmen</HI> would
have been hard put to it to write a good
Defence of him.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="45">
When our Saviour was brought before

<P>But what, I trow, do our <HI>Divines</HI> mean
by <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s <HI>Transfiguration.</HI> We read that
<PB N="41" REF="48">
his Countenance did &s;hine like the Sun,
and his Rayment was made as white as
Snow, and that's all. And is this enough
can we think to demon&s;trate that Tran&s;|action,
a Miraclous <HI>Transfiguration?</HI> Phy|lo&s;ophers
will tell us, that the Reflections
of the Light of the Sun will change the
Appearance of Colours, and to none more

its no wonder if the Countenance of Je&s;us
look'd <HI>Rubicund</HI> when the Sun might &s;hine
on it.</P>
<P>The Word in the Original for transfi|gured
is <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> that is, he was meta|morpho&s;ed,
transform'd or if you will
transfigured. And what is to be under&s;tood
by a <HI>Metamorpho&s;is,</HI> we are to learn not only
from the natural Import of the Word but
from the ancient u&s;e of it. Accordingly
it &s;ignifies nothing le&s;s than the Change
or Transformation of a Per&s;on into the
Forms, Shapes and E&s;&s;ences of Creatures
and Things of a quite different Species,
Size and Figure. But <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> it is conceived,
was not &s;o <HI>transfigured.</HI> Our Divines, I
&s;uppo&s;e would not have him thought &s;uch
a <HI>Po&s;ture-Ma&s;ter</HI> for the whole World. If
I or any one el&s;e &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, that Je&s;us
upon the Mount transform'd him&s;elf into
a Calf, a Lyon, a Bear, a Ram, a Goat,
an Hydra, a Stone, a Tree, and into many
<PB N="42" REF="49" MS="y">
other things of the animate and inanimate
World, I dare &s;ay there would, among our
Orthodox Divines, be &s;uch Exclamations
again&s;t me for Bla&s;phemy, as the like were
never heard of. They, to be &s;ure will not
hear of &s;uch a Transfiguration; nor, like good
plain Believers, will bear any thing more
than that Je&s;us's <HI>Countenance did &s;hine</HI> like
the Sun, and the Colour of his Countenance
was changed; which whether it comes up
to the import of a <HI>Metamorpho&s;is</HI> or not,
they dont care.</P>
<P>But to clo&s;e with our Divines, and ac|knowledge,
that the glorious Change of
<HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Countenance, and of the Colour of
his Ve&s;tments was a true and proper Tran&s;|&s;iguration,
and that it was as real and
wonderful a Miracle as could be wrought;
But then we may, I hope, ask them, what
was the particular Rea&s;on and U&s;e of this
Miracle? Was it a Miracle only for the
&s;ake of a Miracle? That's an Ab&s;urdity in
the Opinion of <NOTE N="56" PLACE="foot">Neque enim Miracula propter Miracula fa|ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">, &s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> illa quae faciebat, mirae&s;&s;ent videntibus, vera e&s;&s;ent intelligentibus. <HI>In Serm.</HI> xcviii. <HI>Sect.</HI> 3.</NOTE> St. <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI> who &s;ays,

wrought it. And what, I pray was the
<PB N="43" REF="50">
U&s;e of this Miracle? Of that the Evan|gelical
Hi&s;tory is &s;ilent; and our Divines
with all their Rea&s;oning Facultys can &s;ay
nothing to it.</P>
<P>And what did <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> on the
Mount with Je&s;us? was it in their own
proper Per&s;ons that they appear'd? or were
they only &s;ome Specters and Apparitions
in Re&s;emblance of them? It is &s;aid, that
they were talking with <HI>Je&s;us</HI>; what then
did they talk about? The three greate&s;t
Prophets and Philo&s;ophers of the Univer&s;e
could not po&s;&s;ibly meet and confer together,
but on the mo&s;t &s;ublime, u&s;eful, and edify|ing
Subject. It's &s;trange, that the Apo&s;tles,
who over-heard their Confabulation, did
not make a Report of it, and tran&s;mit it to
Po&s;terity for our Edification and In&s;truction.
St. <HI>Luke,</HI> as our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lation has it,
&s;eems to &s;ay that they talk'd together of
Je&s;us's <HI>Decea&s;e which he &s;hould accompli&s;h
at Jeru&s;alem,</HI> but this can't be the meaning of

are no le&s;s than a <HI>Barbari&s;m,</HI> and. I appeal
to our Greek Critics, an improper Ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of &s;uch &s;ignification. We mu&s;t
then look for a more proper Con&s;truction
of the Phra&s;e in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> or we mu&s;t re|main
<PB N="44" REF="51">
in the dark, as to the Subject, that
<HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> talked with Je&s;us about.</P>
<P>But further, why could not this Mira|cle
have been wrought in the Valley as
well as upon a Mountain, whither Je&s;us
and his three Apo&s;tles a&s;cended for the
Work of it? Naughty Infidels will &s;ay, it
was for the Advantage of a Cloud, which
often moves and re&s;ts on the Tops of
Mountains, to di&s;play his Pranks in. And
why was it not done in the Pre&s;ence of
the Multitude, as well as of his three A|pu&s;tles?
The more Witne&s;&s;es of a Mira|cle,
the better it is atte&s;ted, and the more
rea&s;onably Credited; and there could not
&s;urely be too many Witne&s;&s;es of this, any
more than of others of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Miracles, if
real ones. Ought not the unbelieving
Multitude, for many Unbelievers unque|&s;tionably
were among&s;t them, to have had
a Sight and Hearing of this Miracle, as
well as the Apo&s;tles? Who &s;hould rather
&s;ee the Miracle, than tho&s;e who wanted
Conviction? Were they to take the Re|port
of the Miracle upon the Word of
the Apo&s;tles, who were Partys in the
Cau&s;e? Our Divines may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay
they ought: But Infidels and Free Think|ers
would cry out again&s;t them, for jug|gling
Tricks, and pious Impo&s;tures.</P>

<P>After this Fa&s;hion do the Fathers, one or

<PB N="48" REF="55">
Part of this Transfiguration of Je&s;us. I
could collect an almo&s;t infinite Number of
Pa&s;&s;ages out of their Writings to this Pur|po&s;e:
But from the&s;e few it is plain, they
look'd on the Story of Chri&s;t's Transfigu|ration,
but as a Figure and Parable; and
they were certainly in the right on't, in as
much as this their Sen&s;e of the Matter and
no other, will &s;olve the Difficultys before
&s;tarted again&s;t the Letter, as any one may
di&s;cern if he attentively review and com|pare
one with the other; As for In&s;tance;
this their Sen&s;e and Interpretation lets us
into the Rea&s;on of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Elias's</HI> ap|pearing
on the Mount with Je&s;us; and
gives us to under&s;tand what they talk'd
about, and that was, not on Je&s;us's <HI>Decea&s;e
which he would accompli&s;h at Jeru&s;alem,</HI> as
our Tran&s;lation has it, but on the Pro|phecy
of the old Te&s;tament; particularly,
as St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays, on Mo&s;e's <HI>Book of Exodus,</HI>
<HI>and how he would fulfill it</HI> at the New Je|ru&s;alem.</P>
<P>Whether any, be&s;ides my &s;elf, do's really
apprehended and is willing to under&s;tand this
Story of Chri&s;t's Transfiguration, as I do, I
neither know nor care. I am not bound to
find others, Ears, Eyes, and Capacitys. What
I have &s;aid is enough to &s;hew the Sen&s;e of
the Fathers about this Matter. If any di&s;like
their concurrent Opinions of Je&s;us's Tran&s;|figuraton's
<PB N="49" REF="56">
being an Emblem, an Enigma,
and Figurative Repre&s;entation of a Future
and mo&s;t Glorious Transfiguration, &s;uch a
one as they &s;peak of; let him account for
the Difficultys and Objections, which I have
before rai&s;ed again&s;t the Letter of this Story.
In the mean Time I &s;hall think it, litterally,
an ab&s;urd, improbable, and incredible one,
and no other than a Prophetical and Para|bolical
Narrative of what will be My&s;teri|ou&s;ly
and more wonderfully done by <HI>Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>And thus I have con&s;ider'd Three of the
Miracles of our Saviour, and &s;hewn how
they are Ab&s;urdities, according to the Let|ter,
con&s;equently do make nothing for his
Authority and Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip. I can and will
do as much by his other Miracles; for I
would not have any one think, I am got|ten
to the End of my Tedder, but for &s;ome
Rea&s;ons be&s;t known to my &s;elf, I publi&s;h
the&s;e Remarks on the&s;e three fir&s;t. After the
Clergy have chew'd upon the&s;e a while, I
will take into Examination &s;ome others of
<HI>Je&s;us's</HI> Miracles, which for their litteral Story
are admired by them. As for In&s;tance
I will take to task his Miracle <NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">John Cap. ii.</NOTE> <HI>of
changing Water into Wine at a Marriage in
Cana of Galilee</HI>; which was the beginning of
<HI>Je&s;us's</HI> Miracles, and &s;hould by right have
been fir&s;t &s;poken to; but I am almo&s;t too
<PB N="50" REF="57">
grave to handle the Letter of this Story as I
ought; and if I had treated it as ludicrou&s;|ly
as it de&s;erves, I don't know, but at &s;et|ting
out, I &s;hould have put the <HI>Clergy</HI> quite
out of all Temper I would not now for the
World be &s;o impious and prophane, as to
believe, with out <HI>Divines,</HI> what is contain'd
and imply'd in the Letter of this Story. If
<HI>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</HI> and not <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> had been
the Author of this Miracle, we &s;hould often
have reproached his Memory with it. It
is &s;aid of <HI>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</HI> that a Table
was all on a &s;udden, at his Command, mira|culou&s;ly
&s;pread with variety of nice Di&s;hes
for the Entertainment of him&s;elf and his
Gue&s;ts; which Miracle, our <HI>Divines</HI> can
tell him makes not at all to his Credit, in
as much as it was done for the &s;ervice and
plea&s;ure of luxurious Appetites. But if <HI>Apol|lonius</HI>
had done, as our <HI>Je&s;us</HI> did at this
Wedding, they would have &s;aid much
wor&s;e of him; and that mode&s;tly &s;peaking,
he delighted to make his Friends thoroughly
merry, or he would not be at the Pains of
a Miracle to turn &s;o much Water into
Wine, after they had before <HI>well drank.</HI>
If the Fathers then don't help us out at
the my&s;tical and true meaning of this Mi|racle,
&s;uch farther Objections may be
form'd again&s;t the Letter, as may make
our Divines a&s;ham'd of it.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="58">
I will al&s;o take into Examination <HI>Je&s;us's</HI>
Miracles <NOTE N="66" PLACE="foot">Matt. c. xiv. and xv, &amp;c.</NOTE> of <HI>feeding many thou&s;ands in
the Wilderne&s;s with a few Loaves and Fi&s;hes,</HI>
which according to the Letter are mo&s;t to|mantick
Tales. I don't in the lea&s;t que&s;tion
<HI>Je&s;us's</HI> Power to magnifie or multiply the
Loaves, and, if he pleas'd to meliorate the
Bread. But that many thou&s;ands of Men,
Women and Children &s;hould follow him
into the Wilderne&s;s, and &s;tay with him
three Days and Nights too, without eating,
is a little again&s;t Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on. Whether
the Wilderne&s;s was near to, or far from
the Peoples Habitations, the difficultys at|tending
the Story are equally great. I
wonder how <HI>Je&s;us</HI> amu&s;ed them all the
while, that they had the Patience to &s;tay
with him without Food; But I much more
wonder, that no Victualers be&s;ides the <HI>Lad</HI>
with his Loaves and Fi&s;hes, of whom, and
his Occupation, whether it was that of a
<HI>Baker</HI> or <HI>Fi&s;hmonger</HI>; and of his neglect of
his Ma&s;ter's Bu&s;ine&s;s here; and of the Rea|&s;on,
that he met with no hungry Chapmen
for his Bread before, we &s;hall make &s;ome
Enquiry; but particurly why he alone, I
&s;ay, and no other Victualers, no other Re|talers
of Cakes and Gingerbread followed
the Camp. In &s;hort, for all the imaginary
greatne&s;s of the Miracle (which there is a
<PB N="52" REF="59">
way to reduce and le&s;&s;en) of Je&s;us's feeding
his thou&s;ands with a few Loaves, there mu&s;t
be &s;ome Fa&s;cination or Enchantment (con|demn'd
by the Laws of the <HI>Jews</HI> as well as
of other Nations) in the Matter; or the
People, if they had &s;tay'd one Day, would
not two, much le&s;s three <HI>to faint,</HI> but
would, e&s;pecially the Women and Children
have been for returning, the fir&s;t Night,
home. We mu&s;t then &s;eek to the Fathers

Barley Loaves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the &s;eptiform'd Spi|rit,
the &s;even Loaves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) for a good No|tion
of this Miracle, and if they don't make
it a Parable; do what our Divines can, it
will turn to the di&s;honour of the Holy Je&s;us.</P>

and wherefore did they &s;o tumultuate a|gain&s;t
the Door of the Hou&s;e? It's
<HI>&s;trange</HI> they had not &s;o much Compa&s;&s;ion
on the <HI>Paralytick,</HI> as to give Way to him:
<PB N="53" REF="60">
It's <HI>more &s;trange,</HI> that his Bearers could get
to the Top of the Hou&s;e with him and
his Bed too, when they could not get to
the Door, nor the Sides of it: It's <HI>yet
&s;tranger,</HI> that the good Man of the Hou&s;e
would &s;uffer his Hou&s;e to be broken up,
when it could not be long, 'ere the Tu|mult
of the People would be appeas'd:
But mo&s;t <HI>&s;trange,</HI> that <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who could
drive his thou&s;ands out of the Temple be|fore
him, and draw as many after him in|to
the Wilderne&s;s, did not, by Force or
Per&s;wa&s;ion, make the People to retreat, but
that &s;uch needle&s;s Trouble and Pains mu&s;t
be taken for the miraculous Cure of this
poor Man. Let's think of the&s;e Things a|gain&s;t
the Time, that out of the Fathers I
prove this Story to be a Parable.</P>
<P>I will al&s;o take into Con&s;ideration the
Miracle of <HI>Je&s;us's</HI> curing <HI>the</HI> <NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot">John Cap. ix.</NOTE> <HI>Blind
Man, for whom Eye-Salve was made of Clay
and Spittle</HI>; which Eye-Salve, whether it
was bal&s;amick or not, do's equally affect
the Credit of the Miracle. If it was na|turally
medicinal, there's an End of the Mi|racle;
and if it was not at all medicinal,
it was fooli&s;hly and impertinently ap|ply'd,
and can be no otherwi&s;e accounted
for, than by con&s;idering it, with the Fa|thers,
as a figurative Act in Je&s;us.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="61">
I will al&s;o take into Con&s;ideration the
&s;everal Stories of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s rai&s;ing of the dead;
and, without que&s;tioning his actual bring|ing
of the Dead to Life again, will prove
from the Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e Storys,
that they are parabotical, and are not lit|terally
to be apply'd to the Proof of Je&s;us<HI>'s</HI>
Divine Authority and Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip; or, for

Daughter from the dead, would never have
turned the People out of the Hou&s;e, who
&s;hould have been his be&s;t and propere&s;t Wit|ne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I will al&s;o Con&s;ider the Miracle of Je|&s;us'<HI>s</HI>
 <NOTE N="70" PLACE="foot">Matt. Cap. xxi. Mark. Cap. xi.</NOTE> <HI>Cur&s;ing the Fig-Tree,</HI> for its not
bearing Fruit out of Sea&s;on; which, upon
the bare mention of it, appears to be a
fooli&s;h, ab&s;urd, and ridiculous Act, if not
figurative.</P>
<P>I will al&s;o con&s;ider the <NOTE N="71" PLACE="foot">Matt. Cap. ii.</NOTE> Journey of the
Wi&s;emen out of the Ea&s;t, with their (litte|rally)
&s;en&s;ele&s;s and ridiculous Pre&s;ents of
<HI>Frankincence</HI> and <HI>Myrrhe</HI> to a new-born
Babe. If with their <HI>Gold,</HI> which could be but
little, they had brought their Dozens of Su|gar,
Soap, and Candles, which would have
been of u&s;e to the Child and his poor Mo|ther
in the Straw, they had acted like
wi&s;e as well as good Men. But what, I
<PB N="55" REF="62">
pray, was the Meaning and Rea&s;on of a
Star, like a <HI>Will a Whi&s;p,</HI> for their Guide
to the Place, where the Holy Infant lay.
Could not God by Divine Impul&s;e, in a
Vi&s;ion or in a Dream, as he ordered their
Return Home, have &s;ent them on this im|portant
Errand; but that a Star mu&s;t be
taken or made out of Cour&s;e to this Pur|po&s;e?
I wonder what Communication pa&s;|&s;ed
between the&s;e Wi&s;e Men and the Star,
or how they came to know one another's
U&s;e and Intention. But the Fathers &s;hall
&s;peak hereafter farther to the &s;en&s;ele&s;ne&s;s
of this Story litterally; and make out the
My&s;tery and true meaning of it.</P>
<P>I will al&s;o, by the Leave of our <HI>Divines,</HI>
take again into Con&s;ideration the miracu|lous
Conception of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI>
and the Re&s;urrection of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> from the
Dead. I do believe, if it may &s;o plea&s;e
our <HI>Divines,</HI> that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was born of a
pure Virgin, and that he aro&s;e from the
Dead; but &s;peaking too briefly, in the
<HI>Moderator,</HI> to the&s;e two Miracles, they took
Offence. I will therefore give them a
Review, and &s;peak Home to them; par|ticularly
to Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection, the E|vangelical
Story of which litterally, is
&s;uch a Complication of Ab&s;urditys, In|coherences,
and Contradictions, that un|le&s;s
the Fathers can help us to a better
<PB N="56" REF="63">
Under&s;tanding of the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> than we
have at pre&s;ent, we mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity give

and miraculous Parts of Je&s;us's
Life, will I take into Examination, and
&s;hew, that none of them litterally do
prove his Divine Authority, &s;o far from
it, that they are full of Ab&s;urdities, Im|probabilities
and Incredibilities; but that
his whole Life in the Fle&s;h, is but <NOTE N="73" PLACE="foot">Quae Enarratio erit Evangelii &s;en&s;ibilis, ni&s;i accommodetur ad intelligibile &amp; &s;pirituale? Nulla &s;ane. <HI>Origen. in Praefat. ad Johan. Evang.</HI></NOTE>

<P>In the end of this Head, it will be a
curious and diverting Subject to examine
the Miracles of Je&s;us, as they are litte|rally
under&s;tood, by the Notions, which
our <HI>Divines</HI> have advanced about Mira|cles;
and to &s;hew, that even their Noti|ons
compared with Chri&s;t's Miracles, are
de&s;tructive of his Authority, and &s;ubver|&s;ive
of Chri&s;tianity. This, I &s;ay, would
be a mo&s;t diverting Undertaking, and it
will be &s;trange, if &s;ome <HI>Free-Thinker,</HI> that
loves Plea&s;ure of this kind, do's not take
<PB N="57" REF="64">
the hint and &s;natch the Work out of my

regard to the Writers again&s;t the

good and right Notion of a Divine Mira|cle;
and I don't doubt, but according to
it, Mr. <HI>Chandler</HI> and the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> think,
they can ju&s;tifie the litteral Story of our
Saviour's Miracles, again&s;t the Charge of
<HI>Fable</HI> and <HI>Romance:</HI> But whether they are
able to do it or not; I &s;hall go on, in
&s;ome Di&s;cour&s;es hereafter to be publi&s;h'd,
<PB N="58" REF="65">
to prove, that our <HI>Divines,</HI> by e&s;pou&s;ing
the Letter of Chri&s;t's Miracles, have decei|ved
them&s;elves into the Belief of the mo&s;t
arrant <HI>Quixoti&s;m,</HI> that can be devi&s;ed and
palm'd upon the Under&s;tandings of Man|kind.
I &s;ay they have deceived them|&s;elves;
for neither the Fathers, nor the A|po&s;tles,
nor even <HI>Je&s;us</HI> him&s;elf meant that
his Miracles, as recorded in the <HI>Evange|li&s;ts,</HI>
&s;hould be taken in a litteral Sen&s;e,
but in <NOTE N="76" PLACE="foot">Dominus no&s;ter ea quae faciebat corporaliter, etiam &s;piritualiter volebat intelligi, <HI>&amp;c. Augu&s;t. Serm.</HI> xcviii. Sect. 3.</NOTE> a my&s;tical, figurative and pa|rabolical

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<P>III. Head of my Di&s;cour&s;e, that is, to

tho&s;e my&s;tical Ones, he would do in the

Shadows.</P>
<P>But this Head can't be rightly &s;poken to,

And if my <HI>Curteous Readers,</HI> will be &s;o

Power and Prai&s;es for healing of bodily
Di&s;ea&s;es, and doing other notable Feats

to the Conver&s;ion of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Infidels.</HI></P>
<P>I have no more to do at pre&s;ent, but,
like a <HI>Moderator,</HI> to conclude with a &s;hort
Addre&s;s and Exhortation, to <HI>Infidels</HI> and
<HI>Apo&s;tates,</HI> the two contending Partys in
the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y. And</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To <HI>Apo&s;tates,</HI> I mean the Writers

Contradiction and Incon&s;i&s;tency among&s;t
you, do like the Name of <HI>Apo&s;tates</HI> which

is given you, I much Que&s;tion: But it is
the propere&s;t, I could think of, for your

whether it be, in your Opinion, opprobi|ous

that I am, <HI>Sirs,</HI> on your &s;ide, as to the
Truth of Chri&s;tianity, and if you'll accept

Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip from Prophecy, upon the Terms

Field of Battle. If you, being wedded to
the litteral Scheme, will not accept of
my A&s;&s;i&s;tance, you may go on in your

<P>You, <HI>Sirs,</HI> can't but be &s;en&s;ible, how

litteral Prophecies, have greivou&s;ly di&s;tre&s;s'd

honourable Retreat in Time, and &s;eek to

Victory, and Triumph over you.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of the help of <HI>Allegori&s;ts,</HI> you,
I find, under the Di&s;appointment of your

to <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s Miracles: But what little
Dependance there is upon his Miracles, in
your Sen&s;e, I have in <HI>Part</HI> proved in this
Di&s;cour&s;e; and this I have done (give me
leave repeatedly to declare it) not for the
Service of your unbelieving Adver&s;aries,
but to reduce you to the good old Way of
interpreting Oracles, which, upon the Te|&s;timony
of the Fathers, will, one Day, be
the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>Whether you, <HI>Sirs,</HI> will be pleas'd with
this &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e on Chri&s;t's Miracles,
I much Que&s;tion. But before you put
your &s;elves into a Rage again&s;t it, I beg of
you to read St. <HI>Theophilus</HI> of <HI>Antioch, Ori|gen,</HI>
St. <HI>Hilary,</HI> St. <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI> St. <HI>Ambro&s;e,</HI>
St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom,</HI> St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI>
St. <HI>Theophylact,</HI> and other occa&s;io|nal
ancient Pieces on one Part or other of
the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI>; and you'll find, how they
countenance &s;uch a Di&s;cour&s;e as this on
Miracles, and will abundantly a&s;&s;i&s;t me in
the Pro&s;ecution of it.</P>
<P>I expect, <HI>Sirs,</HI> that &s;ome of you will be
ready to rave again&s;t me for this Di&s;|cour&s;e;
<PB N="63" REF="70">
but this is my Comfort, that if
your Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould ari&s;e to another Pro|&s;ecution
of me, you can't po&s;&s;ibly &s;epe|rate
any of mine from the Opinions of the
Fathers to ground a Pro&s;ecution on: And
what Di&s;honor in the End will redown to
Prote&s;tant and pretendedly learned <HI>Divines</HI>

for Profanene&s;s, Bla&s;phemy and Infedelity.
If you di&s;like the whole or any Part of
this Di&s;cour&s;e, appear like Men and Scho|lars,
from the <HI>Pre&s;s</HI> again&s;t it. U&s;e me as

<P>I de&s;ire nothing more than to be furiou&s;ly
attack'd from the <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> which, if I am not
much mi&s;taken, would give me a long'd for
opportunity to expo&s;e your Ignorance to
more Advantage.</P>
<P>Be not longer mi&s;taken, <HI>Good Sirs.</HI> The
Hi&s;tory of <HI>Je&s;us's</HI> Life, as recorded in the
<PB N="64" REF="71">
<HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> is an emblematical Repre&s;enta|tion
of his Spiritual Life in the Soul of
Man; and his Miracles are Figures of his
my&s;terious Operations. The four Go&s;pels
are in no Part a litteral Story, but a Sy&s;tem
of my&s;tical Phylo&s;ophy or Theology.</P>
<P>If you are re&s;olv'd not to come into this
Opinion, I beg of you again, before you
break forth into a Pa&s;&s;ion, to try to viudi|cate
the litteral Story of the three Mira|cles
&s;poken to in this Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e
of Je&s;us's <HI>driving the Buyers and Sellers out
of the Temple; of his exorci&s;ing the Devil
out of the Madman; and of his Transfigu|ration
on the Mount</HI>; which if you are able
to defend again&s;t the Fathers and my Ob|jections,
I'll give up the Cau&s;e to you,
and own my &s;elf (what I am &s;arr enough
from being) an impious In&s;idel and Bla&s;|phemer,
and de&s;erving of the wor&s;t Puni&s;h|ment.
In the mean time I make bold
again to a&s;&s;ert, that the litteral Story of
Chri&s;t' Life and Miracles is an ab&s;urd and
incredible Romance, full of Contradictions
and Incon&s;i&s;tencys; and that modern Para|phra&s;es
are not only a con&s;equential Re|flection
on the Intellects of the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI>
and their Divine Gifts of the Spirit, as if
they could not write an intelligible and

are like an <HI>high-mettal'd blind Hor&s;e,</HI> that,

with a &s;trait Rein, would be oppre&s;|&s;ing
and trampling upon all, that &s;tood in
the Way of their Intere&s;ts, to the Di&s;tur|bance
of <HI>Civil Society.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Profanene&s;s</HI> to do's the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> charge
me with. But why &s;o? Becau&s;e I ridicule
the Non&s;en&s;e and Ab&s;urditys of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>'s
Miracles according to the Letter, which
he venerates. Very fine indeed! The
<HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> would wor&s;hip the <HI>Head</HI> of an <HI>A&s;s,</HI>
and a wi&s;er Man than him&s;elf, without
the Charge of Profanene&s;s, mu&s;t not laugh
at his fooli&s;h Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>And <HI>Bla&s;phemy</HI> la&s;tly does the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI>
accu&s;e me of: And this is a &s;ad <HI>Bugbear</HI>
Word, that has frighted Abundance of
People into dreadful Apprehen&s;ions of my
Guilt, even to the Abhorrence of me. But
the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> &s;hould fir&s;t have defined, what
is meant by <HI>Bla&s;phemy,</HI> and have proved
one guilty of it, before he made his Ex|clamations:
Or the <HI>Turks</HI> may &s;ay that
a Je&s;t upon their <HI>Alcoran,</HI> in which there
are no Contradictions, is as much a <HI>Bla&s;|phemy,</HI>
as any Ludicrou&s;ne&s;s upon the
<HI>Go&s;pels,</HI> which are full of Incon&s;i&s;tencies.
That there is &s;uch a Sin or Error, call'd
<HI>Bla&s;phemy,</HI> according to the Scriptures, is
certain: But our <HI>Divines</HI> are undetermined
<PB N="66" REF="73">
about the Nature of it. I intend to take
my Opportunity to treat on the Sin of
Bla&s;phemy, and to prove, <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of
the <HI>Letter</HI> are the only Per&s;ons, that can
be guilty of it. <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the <HI>Letter,</HI>
upon the Authority of the Fathers are
the Wor&s;hippers of the <HI>Apocalyptical Bea&s;t</HI>;
and anti-allegorical Expo&s;itions are that
Bla&s;phemy, St. <HI>John</HI> writes of, which the
<HI>Bea&s;t</HI> and his Wor&s;hippers, will open their
Mouths in, again&s;t the mo&s;t High. This
&s;hall be proved as clear as the Light.
But when I do it, I would not have any
think, it is with an Intention, to bring
the Bi&s;hops of <HI>London, Litchfield,</HI> and St.
<HI>Davids</HI> or any other <HI>Divines,</HI> under Pro&s;e|cution
for that heinous Sin: No, my God
is omnipotent, omni&s;cient and omnipre|&s;ent;
and knows how and when to reckon
with &s;uch Bla&s;phemers, without calling
upon the civil Magi&s;trate to do it for
him. Should I importune the Civil Au|thority
to execute Vengeance upon them&punc;
I &s;hould make a fooli&s;h <HI>Calf</HI> or a Sen&s;e+le&s;s <HI>Idol</HI> of my God, that was unable
or knew not how, nor when to vindi|cate
his own Cau&s;e. Surely the <HI>Bi&s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
of <HI>London,</HI> upon his Pro&s;ecution of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
for Bla&s;phemy, mu&s;t think his God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
<HI>a&s;leep</HI> or <HI>gone a Journey</HI> from Home; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
he would not be for taking God's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="67" REF="74">
Work out of his Hands, and committing
it to the Care of the Civil Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> moreover &s;hould con&s;ider,
that the Words <HI>profane</HI> and <HI>bla&s;phemous</HI>
are of no u&s;e and &s;ignificaiton among
Philo&s;ophers, who in Di&s;putation never
ca&s;t them at each other, however they
may differ in Opinion. Philo&s;ophers are
all &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;uch profound Vene|rators
of the Deity, as they would not
be guilty of <HI>Profanene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Bla&s;phemy</HI>
for the whole World. If any of our
School of <HI>Free-Thinkers</HI> &s;hould &s;ay of his
Opponent that he's <HI>profane</HI> and <HI>bla&s;phe|mous,</HI>
he would be reprimanded for want
of Wit, Temper and good Manners; and
be told that he's like a <HI>Billing &s;gate Scold,</HI>
who had Recour&s;e to impertinent bad Lan|guage,
when her Rea&s;on fails her for bet|ter
Rhetorick.</P>
<P>But it may be, for ought I know, the
<HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> has &s;ome De&s;ign in his Accu&s;a|tions
again&s;t me for <HI>Profanene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Bla&s;|phemy</HI>;
but I hope it is a better than to
prejudice the Civil Magi&s;trate, or to in|cen&s;e
the Populace.</P>
<P>According to the Fathers I am &s;o far
from being a Bla&s;phemer, that they &s;ay,
<HI>Chri&s;t</HI> upon the litteral interpretation of his
Miracles is metamorpho&s;ed into the fal&s;e-Chri&s;t,
call'd <HI>Anti-Chri&s;t.</HI> Whether there
<PB N="68" REF="75">
is any Truth in this their Opinion I can't
be po&s;itive, till the Experiment is fully
made. But if our <HI>Clergy</HI> will keep their
Temper, and grant me a clear Stage of
Battle, I'll try it out; and &s;ee whether I
I can't, by the Club of Rea&s;on and primi|tive
Authority give their <HI>Anti-Chri&s;t</HI> a fa|tal
Blow: Who knows but I may give
Peace to the Church, and reconcile all
Partys by it?</P>
<P>However this may be; I am &s;ure, no
Man can wi&s;h for a greater Advantage
over his Enemy, than I have over the
<HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> in this Controver&s;y: But he &s;hall
find me a generous Adver&s;ary, who will
make no wor&s;e u&s;e of my Advantage
over him than now and then to put him
in Mind of his <HI>Pa&s;toral Letter,</HI> and of the
Pro&s;ecution; unle&s;s I &s;hould be tempted,
ere long, to publi&s;h my <HI>Moderatorial</HI>
Letter, like his <HI>Pa&s;toral</HI> one, to the Peo|ple
of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> with <HI>Ten</HI>
whole&s;ome Rules in it, not only to cau|tion
them again&s;t fal&s;e Prophets and fal&s;e
Teachers, without forgetting the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of
the <HI>Dioce&s;e,</HI> but to direct them to the
Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Fountain of the growing
Sins, Errors and Infidelity of the Age,
which the <HI>Clergy</HI> know I am of Ability
to lay open.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="76">
When I began the Publication of the&s;e
<HI>Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> I own, I laid a <HI>Trap</HI> for &s;ome
con&s;iderable <HI>Clergyman</HI>; but little ima|gined,
the great <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>London</HI> would
be caught in it. But now I have taken
hold of him, I'll not relea&s;e him out of the
Controver&s;y, till he has &s;orely repented of
his Ignorance or Malice in calling me a
<HI>Writer, in Favour of Infidelity.</HI></P>
<P>So much at pre&s;ent for the Bi&s;hop of
<HI>London.</HI> I have been the quicker of late
in the printing of <HI>this</HI>; becau&s;e I am given
to under&s;tand, the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of St. <HI>Davids</HI>
&s;tays for it, intending to make but one
Work of it, and an&s;wer all <HI>&s;ix Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> together. I hope my <HI>Rabbi</HI>'s Letter here
will be thought by him, a good Payment
for his Patience, And now I &s;hall be in
Expectation of his Mountainous Produc|tion,
and where I &s;hall hide my&s;elf from
the terrible Strokes of his Pen, I have not
as yet con&s;ider'd.</P>
<P>I am not a little pleas'd to &s;ee a <HI>Couple</HI>
of Di&s;&s;enting Preachers, <HI>viz.</HI> Dr. <HI>Harris</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Atkin&s;on,</HI> li&s;ted into the Contro|ver&s;y
again&s;t me. If they had kept their
Necks out of the Collar, they might have
di&s;&s;embled and pretended, that, upon the
Conclu&s;ion of the Battle, when it would
have appear'd, I am a real Contender for
<PB N="70" REF="77">
Primitive Chri&s;tianity, they had a better
Under&s;tanding of the Fathers, and a
clearer View of my De&s;ign, than to &s;u&s;|pect
me of Bla&s;phemy and Infidelity:
But now they are engaged with equal
Spite, Ignorance and Defamations again&s;t
me, they mu&s;t take their &s;hare of the Fate
and Shame, with the <HI>Clergy,</HI> upon the
Conclu&s;ion of the Controver&s;y</P>
<P>There's no Body can think it worth my
while to be&s;tow a Sixpenny <HI>Pamphlet</HI> upon
either of the&s;e <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> but for all that,
they &s;hall not be altogether &s;lighted and
neglected by me. I have made a Collec|tion
of their Rhetorical Flowers, which
occa&s;ionally &s;hall be pre&s;ented to the Pub|lick,
to the Admiration of their Wit,
Rea&s;on, Learning and Eloquence. And
at pre&s;ent only take Notice, that they
are <HI>both</HI> for the Per&s;ecution of me; but
not &s;o much for my Opinions, as the In|decency,
Irreverence, and Immorality of
my Stile; forfooth ! which is &s;uch a
Di&s;tinction, as may be ea&s;ily Stretch'd to
the Ju&s;tification of the Per&s;ecution of all
Authors, whom the Prie&s;thood in Power
&s;hall not like. Mr. <HI>Atkin&s;on's</HI> Argument
for the Pre&s;ecution of me, is much the
&s;ame with that, which <HI>John Calvin</HI> u&s;ed
for the Per&s;ecution of that great Philo&s;o|pher
<HI>Servetus</HI>; the Inju&s;tice and Cruelty of
<PB N="71" REF="78">
who&s;e death and &s;ufferings is a greater
Reproach to the Name of <HI>Calvin,</HI> than the
Martyrdom of any <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> can be to
the Memory of any Popi&s;h Prelate.</P>
<P>To conclude, what I have written, in
the&s;e <HI>Six Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> is with a View to
the Glory of God, the Advancement of
Truth, the Happine&s;s of Mankind, the
Demolition of <HI>Babylon,</HI> the Edification
of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and the Demon&s;tration of the
Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip of our Spiritual <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to
whom be Glory for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
